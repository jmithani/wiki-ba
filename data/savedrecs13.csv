The origin of this correlation is unknown. Current theory proposes a causal effect of noise in sensory neurons on perceptual decisions(10-12), but the correlation could result from different brain states associated with the perceptual choice(13) (a top-down explanation). These two schemes have very different implications for the role of sensory neurons in forming decisions(14). Here we use white-noise analysis(15) to measure tuning functions of V2 neurons associated with choice and simultaneously measure how the variation in the stimulus affects the subjects' (two macaques) perceptual decisions(16-18). In causal models, stronger effects of the stimulus upon decisions, mediated by sensory neurons, are associated with stronger choice-related activity. However, we find that over the time course of the trial these measures change in different directions-at odds with causal models. An analysis of the effect of reward size also supports this conclusion. Finally, we find that choice is associated with changes in neuronal gain that are incompatible with causal models. All three results are readily explained if choice is associated with changes in neuronal gain caused by top-down phenomena that closely resemble attention(19). We conclude that top-down processes contribute to choice-related activity. Thus, even forming simple sensory decisions involves complex interactions between cognitive processes and sensory neurons.","[Nienborg, Hendrikje; Cumming, Bruce G.] NEI, Sensorimotor Res Lab, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA","Nienborg, H (reprint author), NEI, Sensorimotor Res Lab, NIH, 49 Convent Dr, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA.",hnienb@gmail.com,,,US National Institutes of Health; National Eye Institute,"This research was supported by the Intramural Research Program of the US National Institutes of Health, National Eye Institute.

Although compound fusion between vesicles(2,3) was proposed to occur at ribbon-type synapses(4,5), whether it exists, how it is mediated, and what role it plays at conventional synapses remain unclear. Here we report the existence of compound fusion, its underlying mechanism, and its role at a nerve terminal containing conventional active zones in rats and mice. We found that high potassium application and high frequency firing induced giant capacitance up-steps, reflecting exocytosis of vesicles larger than regular ones, followed by giant down-steps, reflecting bulk endocytosis. These intense stimuli also induced giant vesicle-like structures, as observed with electron microscopy, and giant miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs), reflecting more transmitter release. Calcium and its sensor for vesicle fusion, synaptotagmin, were required for these giant events. After high frequency firing, calcium/synaptotagmin-dependent mEPSC size increase was paralleled by calcium/synaptotagmin-dependent post-tetanic potentiation. These results suggest a new route of exocytosis and endocytosis composed of three steps. First, calcium/synaptotagmin mediates compound fusion between vesicles. Second, exocytosis of compound vesicles increases quantal size, which increases synaptic strength and contributes to the generation of post-tetanic potentiation. Third, exocytosed compound vesicles are retrieved via bulk endocytosis. We suggest that this vesicle cycling route be included in models of synapses in which only vesicle fusion with the plasma membrane is considered(1).","[He, Liming; Xue, Lei; Xu, Jianhua; McNeil, Benjamin D.; Bai, Li; Wu, Ling-Gang] NINDS, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Melicoff, Ernestina; Adachi, Roberto] Univ Texas MD Anderson Canc Ctr, Dept Pulm Med, Houston, TX 77030 USA","Wu, LG (reprint author), NINDS, 35 Convent Dr,Bldg 35,Room 2B 1012, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA.",wul@ninds.nih.gov,,"McNeil, Benjamin/0000-0001-7545-3598; Xu, Jianhua/0000-0003-0084-8856; Melicoff, Ernestina/0000-0001-5696-7112",National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke Intramural Research Program; American Heart Association,"We thank J.

In Drosophila, Hh transduction is mediated by a cytoplasmic signalling complex(3-5) that includes the putative serine-threonine kinase Fused (Fu) and the kinesin Costal 2 (Cos2, also known as Cos), yet Fu does not have a conserved role in Hh signalling in mammals(6,7). Mouse Fu (also known as Stk36) mutants are viable and seem to respond normally to Hh signalling. Here we show that mouse Fu is essential for construction of the central pair apparatus of motile, 912 cilia and offers a new model of human primary ciliary dyskinesia. We found that mouse Fu physically interacts with Kif27, a mammalian Cos2 orthologue(8), and linked Fu to known structural components of the central pair apparatus, providing evidence for the first regulatory component involved in central pair construction. We also demonstrated that zebrafish Fu is required both for Hh signalling and cilia biogenesis in Kupffer's vesicle. Mouse Fu rescued both Hh-dependent and-independent defects in zebrafish. Our results delineate a new pathway for central pair apparatus assembly, identify common regulators of Hh signalling and motile ciliogenesis, and provide insights into the evolution of the Hh cascade.","[Wilson, Christopher W.; Chen, Miao-Hsueh; Yang, Jehn-Hsiahn; Gacayan, Rhodora; Chuang, Pao-Tien] Univ Calif San Francisco, Cardiovasc Res Inst, San Francisco, CA 94158 USA; [Nguyen, Catherine T.; Huang, Jie; Chen, Jau-Nian] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Mol Cell & Dev Biol, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA","Chuang, PT (reprint author), Univ Calif San Francisco, Cardiovasc Res Inst, San Francisco, CA 94158 USA.",pao-tien.chuang@ucsf.edu,,"YANG, JEHN-HSIAHN/0000-0001-8648-0882; Chen, Miao-Hsueh/0000-0002-9715-3067; Chen, Jau-Nian/0000-0001-8807-3607",National Institutes of Health; American Lung Association,"We thank H.

Here we show that HSPC engraftment of bone marrow in fetal development is dependent on the guanine-nucleotide-binding protein stimulatory a subunit (G alpha(s)). HSPCs from adult mice deficient in G alpha(s) (G alpha(-/-)(s)) differentiate and undergo chemotaxis, but also do not home to or engraft in the bone marrow in adult mice and demonstrate a marked inability to engage the marrow microvasculature. If deleted after engraftment, G alpha(s) deficiency did not lead to lack of retention in the marrow, rather cytokine-induced mobilization into the blood was impaired. Testing whether activation of G alpha(s) affects HSPCs, pharmacological activators enhanced homing and engraftment in vivo. G alpha(s) governs specific aspects of HSPC localization under physiological conditions in vivo and may be pharmacologically targeted to improve transplantation efficiency.","[Adams, Gregor B.; Alley, Ian R.; Chabner, Karissa T.; Jeanson, Nathaniel T.; Lo Celso, Cristina; Marsters, Emily S.; Scadden, David T.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Ctr Regenerat Med, Boston, MA 02114 USA; [Chung, Ung-il; Kronenberg, Henry M.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Endocrine Unit, Boston, MA 02114 USA; [Lin, Charles P.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Adv Microscopy Program, Ctr Syst Biol, Boston, MA 02114 USA; [Lin, Charles P.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Wellman Ctr Photomed, Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Boston, MA 02114 USA; [Adams, Gregor B.; Lo Celso, Cristina; Scadden, David T.] Harvard Univ, Harvard Stem Cell Inst, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Scadden, David T.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Stem Cell & Regenerat Biol, Boston, MA 02114 USA; [Chen, Min; Weinstein, Lee S.] NIDDKD, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA","Scadden, DT (reprint author), Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Ctr Regenerat Med, Boston, MA 02114 USA.",dscadden@mgh.harvard.edu,,,"Burroughs Wellcome Fund, Doris Duke Charitable Trust; Harvard Stem Cell Institute; National Institutes of Health","Financial support for this work was provided by the Burroughs Wellcome Fund, Doris Duke Charitable Trust (D.

Although it is known that lineage specification depends on cell-specific gene expression, which in turn is driven by promoters, enhancers, insulators and other cis-regulatory DNA sequences for each gene(1-3), the relative roles of these regulatory elements in this process are not clear. We have previously developed a chromatin-immunoprecipitation-based microarray method (ChIP-chip) to locate promoters, enhancers and insulators in the human genome(4-6). Here we use the same approach to identify these elements in multiple cell types and investigate their roles in cell-type-specific gene expression. We observed that the chromatin state at promoters and CTCF-binding at insulators is largely invariant across diverse cell types. In contrast, enhancers are marked with highly cell-type-specific histone modification patterns, strongly correlate to cell-type-specific gene expression programs on a global scale, and are functionally active in a cell-type-specific manner. Our results define over 55,000 potential transcriptional enhancers in the human genome, significantly expanding the current catalogue of human enhancers and highlighting the role of these elements in cell-type-specific gene expression.","[Heintzman, Nathaniel D.; Hon, Gary C.; Hawkins, R.

However, the function or occurrence of this specific histone mark has not been studied in multicellular eukaryotes, mainly because the Rtt109 enzyme that is known to mediate acetylation of H3K56 (H3K56ac) is fungal-specific(3,4). Here we demonstrate that the histone acetyl transferase CBP (also known as Nejire) in flies and CBP and p300 (Ep300) in humans acetylate H3K56, whereas Drosophila Sir2 and human SIRT1 and SIRT2 deacetylate H3K56ac. The histone chaperones ASF1A in humans and Asf1 in Drosophila are required for acetylation of H3K56 in vivo, whereas the histone chaperone CAF-1 (chromatin assembly factor 1) in humans and Caf1 in Drosophila are required for the incorporation of histones bearing this mark into chromatin. We show that, in response to DNA damage, histones bearing acetylated K56 are assembled into chromatin in Drosophila and human cells, forming foci that colocalize with sites of DNA repair. Furthermore, acetylation of H3K56 is increased in multiple types of cancer, correlating with increased levels of ASF1A in these tumours. Our identification of multiple proteins regulating the levels of H3K56 acetylation in metazoans will allow future studies of this critical and unique histone modification that couples chromatin assembly to DNA synthesis, cell proliferation and cancer.","[Das, Chandrima; Tyler, Jessica K.] Univ Colorado, Sch Med, Dept Biochem & Mol Genet, Aurora, CO 80045 USA; [Lucia, M.

Previous studies identified two universally conserved translation elongation factors, EF-Tu in bacteria (known as eEF1A in eukaryotes) and EF-G (eEF2), which deliver aminoacyl-tRNAs to the ribosome and promote ribosomal translocation, respectively(1). The factor eIF5A (encoded by HYP2 and ANB1 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae), the sole protein in eukaryotes and archaea to contain the unusual amino acid hypusine (N(epsilon)-(4-amino-2-hydroxybutyl)lysine)(2), was originally identified based on its ability to stimulate the yield (endpoint) of methionylpuromycin synthesis-a model assay for first peptide bond synthesis thought to report on certain aspects of translation initiation(3,4). Hypusine is required for eIF5A to associate with ribosomes(5,6) and to stimulate methionyl-puromycin synthesis(7). Because eIF5A did not stimulate earlier steps of translation initiation(8), and depletion of eIF5A in yeast only modestly impaired protein synthesis(9), it was proposed that eIF5A function was limited to stimulating synthesis of the first peptide bond or that eIF5A functioned on only a subset of cellular messenger RNAs. However, the precise cellular role of eIF5A is unknown, and the protein has also been linked to mRNA decay, including the nonsense-mediated mRNA decay pathway(10,11), and to nucleocytoplasmic transport(12,13). Here we use molecular genetic and biochemical studies to show that eIF5A promotes translation elongation. Depletion or inactivation of eIF5A in the yeast S. cerevisiae resulted in the accumulation of polysomes and an increase in ribosomal transit times. Addition of recombinant eIF5A from yeast, but not a derivative lacking hypusine, enhanced the rate of tripeptide synthesis in vitro. Moreover, inactivation of eIF5A mimicked the effects of the eEF2 inhibitor sordarin, indicating that eIF5A might function together with eEF2 to promote ribosomal translocation. Because eIF5A is a structural homologue of the bacterial protein EF-P(14,15), we propose that eIF5A/EF-P is a universally conserved translation elongation factor.","[Saini, Preeti; Dever, Thomas E.] NICHD, Lab Gene Regulat & Dev, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Eyler, Daniel E.; Green, Rachel] Johns Hopkins Univ, Sch Med, Dept Mol Biol & Genet, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA","Dever, TE (reprint author), NICHD, Lab Gene Regulat & Dev, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA.",tdever@nih.gov,,"Dever, Thomas/0000-0001-7120-9678",HHMI; NIH; NICHD,"Acknowledgements We thank T.

Lipid droplets and autophagic components associated during nutrient deprivation, and inhibition of autophagy in cultured hepatocytes and mouse liver increased triglyceride storage in lipid droplets. This study identifies a critical function for autophagy in lipid metabolism that could have important implications for human diseases with lipid over-accumulation such as those that comprise the metabolic syndrome.","[Singh, Rajat; Kaushik, Susmita; Wang, Yongjun; Xiang, Youqing; Cuervo, Ana Maria; Czaja, Mark J.] Albert Einstein Coll Med, Dept Med, Bronx, NY 10461 USA; [Singh, Rajat; Kaushik, Susmita; Wang, Yongjun; Xiang, Youqing; Novak, Inna; Cuervo, Ana Maria; Czaja, Mark J.] Albert Einstein Coll Med, Marion Bessin Liver Res Ctr, Bronx, NY 10461 USA; [Kaushik, Susmita; Cuervo, Ana Maria] Albert Einstein Coll Med, Dept Dev & Mol Biol, Bronx, NY 10461 USA; [Kaushik, Susmita; Cuervo, Ana Maria] Albert Einstein Coll Med, Inst Aging Studies, Bronx, NY 10461 USA; [Novak, Inna] Albert Einstein Coll Med, Dept Pediat, Bronx, NY 10461 USA; [Komatsu, Masaaki; Tanaka, Keiji] Tokyo Metropolitan Inst Med Sci, Lab Frontier Sci, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo 1138613, Japan","Czaja, MJ (reprint author), Albert Einstein Coll Med, Dept Med, 1300 Morris Pk Ave, Bronx, NY 10461 USA.",amcuervo@aecom.yu.edu; czaja@aecom.yu.edu,,"Cuervo, Ana Maria/0000-0002-0771-700X",National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases; National Institute on Aging; American Liver Foundation Postdoctoral Research Fellowship Award,"We thank D.

Here we present the 2.9 angstrom structure of CRM1 bound to snurportin 1 (SNUPN). Snurportin 1 binds CRM1 in a bipartite manner by means of an amino-terminal LR-NES and its nucleotide-binding domain. The LR-NES is a combined alpha-helical-extended structure that occupies a hydrophobic groove between two CRM1 outer helices. The LR-NES interface explains the consensus hydrophobic pattern, preference for intervening electronegative residues and inhibition by leptomycin B. The second nuclear export signal epitope is a basic surface on the snurportin 1 nucleotide-binding domain, which binds an acidic patch on CRM1 adjacent to the LR-NES site. Multipartite recognition of individually weak nuclear export signal epitopes may be common to CRM1 substrates, enhancing CRM1 binding beyond the generally low affinity LR-NES. Similar energetic construction is also used in multipartite nuclear localization signals to provide broad substrate specificity and rapid evolution in nuclear transport.","[Dong, Xiuhua; Biswas, Anindita; Sueel, Katherine E.; Jackson, Laurie K.; Martinez, Rita; Gu, Hongmei; Chook, Yuh Min] Univ Texas SW Med Ctr Dallas, Dept Pharmacol, Dallas, TX 75390 USA","Chook, YM (reprint author), Univ Texas SW Med Ctr Dallas, Dept Pharmacol, 6001 Forest Pk, Dallas, TX 75390 USA.",yuhmin.chook@utsouthwestern.edu,,,"National Institute of Health (NIH) [R01GM069909, R01GM069909-03S1, 5-T32-GM008297]; Welch Foundation [I-1532]; UT Southwestern Endowed Scholars Program; US Department of Energy; Office of Energy Research [W-31-109-ENG-38]","We thank Y.

This emission(3-10) has a spectrum characteristic of a similar to 10(8) K optically thin thermal plasma, with a prominent iron emission line at 6.7 keV. The gravitational well of the Galactic disk, however, is far too shallow to confine such a hot interstellar medium; instead, it would flow away at a velocity of a few thousand kilometres per second, exceeding the speed of sound in the gas. To replenish the energy losses requires a source of 10(43) erg s(-1), exceeding by orders of magnitude all plausible energy sources in the Milky Way(11). An alternative is that the hot plasma is bound to a multitude of faint sources(12), which is supported by the recently observed similarities in the X-ray and near-infrared surface brightness distributions(13,14) (the latter traces the Galactic stellar distribution). Here we report that at energies of similar to 6-7 keV, more than 80 per cent of the seemingly diffuse X-ray emission is resolved into discrete sources, probably accreting white dwarfs and coronally active stars.","[Revnivtsev, M.] Tech Univ Munich, Excellence Cluster Univ, D-85748 Garching, Germany; [Revnivtsev, M.; Sazonov, S.; Churazov, E.; Vikhlinin, A.; Sunyaev, R.] Space Res Inst, Moscow 117997, Russia; [Sazonov, S.; Churazov, E.; Sunyaev, R.] Max Planck Inst Astrophys, D-85748 Garching, Germany; [Forman, W.; Vikhlinin, A.] Harvard Smithsonian Ctr Astrophys, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA","Revnivtsev, M (reprint author), Tech Univ Munich, Excellence Cluster Univ, D-85748 Garching, Germany.",mikej@mpa-garching.mpg.de,"Churazov, Eugene/A-7783-2013","Forman, William/0000-0002-9478-1682","DFG Cluster of Excellence; NASA Chandra [GO8-9132A]; Russian Academy of Sciences [OFH-17]; RFFI [07-02-01004, 07-02-00961]","M.

However, conventional CCDs (charge-coupled devices) and their complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) counterparts are incapable of capturing fast dynamical processes with high sensitivity and resolution. This is due in part to a technological limitation-it takes time to read out the data from sensor arrays. Also, there is the fundamental compromise between sensitivity and frame rate; at high frame rates, fewer photons are collected during each frame-a problem that affects nearly all optical imaging systems. Here we report an imaging method that overcomes these limitations and offers frame rates that are at least 1,000 times faster than those of conventional CCDs. Our technique maps a two-dimensional (2D) image into a serial time-domain data stream and simultaneously amplifies the image in the optical domain. We capture an entire 2D image using a single-pixel photodetector and achieve a net image amplification of 25 dB (a factor of 316). This overcomes the compromise between sensitivity and frame rate without resorting to cooling and high-intensity illumination. As a proof of concept, we perform continuous real-time imaging at a frame speed of 163 ns (a frame rate of 6.1 MHz) and a shutter speed of 440 ps. We also demonstrate real-time imaging of microfluidic flow and phase-explosion effects that occur during laser ablation.","[Goda, K.; Tsia, K.

In bulk, electronic conduction in these materials takes place mainly through the s and p electrons, whereas the magnetic moments are mostly in the narrow d-electron bands, where they tend to align. This general picture may change at the nanoscale because electrons at the surfaces of materials experience interactions that differ from those in the bulk. Here we show direct evidence for such changes: electronic transport in atomic-scale contacts of pure ferromagnets ( iron, cobalt and nickel), despite their strong bulk ferromagnetism, unexpectedly reveal Kondo physics, that is, the screening of local magnetic moments by the conduction electrons below a characteristic temperature(1). The Kondo effect creates a sharp resonance at the Fermi energy, affecting the electrical properties of the system; this appears as a Fano-Kondo resonance(2) in the conductance characteristics as observed in other artificial nanostructures(3-11). The study of hundreds of contacts shows material-dependent log-normal distributions of the resonance width that arise naturally from Kondo theory(12). These resonances broaden and disappear with increasing temperature, also as in standard Kondo systems(4-7). Our observations, supported by calculations, imply that coordination changes can significantly modify magnetism at the nanoscale. Therefore, in addition to standard micromagnetic physics, strong electronic correlations along with atomic-scale geometry need to be considered when investigating the magnetic properties of magnetic nanostructures.","[Reyes Calvo, M.; Fernandez-Rossier, Joaquin; Jose Palacios, Juan; Untiedt, Carlos] Univ Alicante, Fac Ciencias, Dept Fis Aplicada, E-03790 Alicante, Spain; [Jacob, David] Rutgers State Univ, Dept Phys & Astron, Piscataway, NJ 08854 USA; [Natelson, Douglas] Rice Univ, Dept Phys & Astron, Houston, TX 77005 USA","Untiedt, C (reprint author), Univ Alicante, Fac Ciencias, Dept Fis Aplicada, E-03790 Alicante, Spain.",untiedt@ua.es,"Jacob, David/A-3922-2011; Untiedt, Carlos/C-6269-2011; fernandez-rossier, joaquin/C-3910-2009; Palacios, Juan Jose/A-9872-2011; Calvo, Reyes/L-8651-2014","Jacob, David/0000-0003-4434-844X; Untiedt, Carlos/0000-0003-4800-082X; fernandez-rossier, joaquin/0000-0003-2297-0289; Palacios, Juan Jose/0000-0003-2378-0866; Calvo, Reyes/0000-0001-5991-2619","European Union through MolSpinQIP and Spanish MEC [MAT2007-65487, 31099-E, CSD2007-0010]; US National Science Foundation (NSF) [DMR-0528969]; NSF [DMR-0347253]; Lucille Packard Foundation; W.

However, the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions corresponding to a specified maximum warming are poorly known owing to uncertainties in the carbon cycle and the climate response. Here we provide a comprehensive probabilistic analysis aimed at quantifying GHG emission budgets for the 2000-50 period that would limit warming throughout the twenty-first century to below 2 degrees C, based on a combination of published distributions of climate system properties and observational constraints. We show that, for the chosen class of emission scenarios, both cumulative emissions up to 2050 and emission levels in 2050 are robust indicators of the probability that twenty-first century warming will not exceed 2 degrees C relative to pre-industrial temperatures. Limiting cumulative CO2 emissions over 2000-50 to 1,000 Gt CO2 yields a 25% probability of warming exceeding 2 degrees C-and a limit of 1,440 Gt CO2 yields a 50% probability - given a representative estimate of the distribution of climate system properties. As known 2000-06 CO2 emissions(3) were similar to 234 Gt CO2, less than half the proven economically recoverable oil, gas and coal reserves(4-6) can still be emitted up to 2050 to achieve such a goal. Recent G8 Communiques(7) envisage halved global GHG emissions by 2050, for which we estimate a 12-45% probability of exceeding 2 degrees C-assuming 1990 as emission base year and a range of published climate sensitivity distributions. Emissions levels in 2020 are a less robust indicator, but for the scenarios considered, the probability of exceeding 2 degrees C rises to 53-87% if global GHG emissions are still more than 25% above 2000 levels in 2020.","[Meinshausen, Malte; Hare, William; Frieler, Katja] Telegraphenberg, Potsdam Inst Climate Impact Res, D-14412 Potsdam, Germany; [Meinshausen, Nicolai] Univ Oxford, Dept Stat, Oxford OX1 3TG, England; [Hare, William] Telegraphenberg, Climate Analyt, D-14412 Potsdam, Germany; [Raper, Sarah C.

But the eventual equilibrium global mean temperature associated with a given stabilization level of atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations remains uncertain(1-3), complicating the setting of stabilization targets to avoid potentially dangerous levels of global warming(4-8). Similar problems apply to the carbon cycle: observations currently provide only a weak constraint on the response to future emissions(9-11). Here we use ensemble simulations of simple climate-carbon-cycle models constrained by observations and projections from more comprehensive models to simulate the temperature response to a broad range of carbon dioxide emission pathways. We find that the peak warming caused by a given cumulative carbon dioxide emission is better constrained than the warming response to a stabilization scenario. Furthermore, the relationship between cumulative emissions and peak warming is remarkably insensitive to the emission pathway (timing of emissions or peak emission rate). Hence policy targets based on limiting cumulative emissions of carbon dioxide are likely to be more robust to scientific uncertainty than emission-rate or concentration targets. Total anthropogenic emissions of one trillion tonnes of carbon (3.67 trillion tonnes of CO2), about half of which has already been emitted since industrialization began, results in a most likely peak carbon-dioxide-induced warming of 2 degrees C above pre-industrial temperatures, with a 5-95% confidence interval of 1.3-3.9 degrees C.","[Allen, Myles R.; Frame, David J.] Univ Oxford, Dept Phys, Oxford OX1 3PU, England; [Frame, David J.] Univ Oxford, Smith Sch Enterprise & Environm, Oxford OX1 2BQ, England; [Huntingford, Chris] Ctr Ecol & Hydrol, Wallingford OX10 8BB, Oxon, England; [Jones, Chris D.] Met Off Hadley Ctr, Exeter EX1 3PB, Devon, England; [Lowe, Jason A.] Univ Reading, Dept Meteorol, Met Off Hadley Ctr, Reading Unit, Reading RG6 6BB, Berks, England; [Meinshausen, Malte] Potsdam Inst Climate Impact Res, D-14412 Potsdam, Germany; [Meinshausen, Nicolai] Univ Oxford, Dept Stat, Oxford OX1 3TG, England","Allen, MR (reprint author), Univ Oxford, Dept Phys, Oxford OX1 3PU, England.",myles.allen@physics.ox.ac.uk,"Allen, Myles/A-5172-2012; Meinshausen, Malte/A-7037-2011; Frame, Dave/A-8918-2014; Frame, Dave/R-6169-2016; Jones, Chris/I-2983-2014; Huntingford, Chris/A-4307-2008","Meinshausen, Malte/0000-0003-4048-3521; Frame, Dave/0000-0002-0949-3994; Huntingford, Chris/0000-0002-5941-7770",DOE Office of Science; Office of Biological and Environmental Research; NOAA Climate Program Office; British Council; CEH Science Budget Fund; Joint DECC; Defra and MoD Integrated Climate Programme [GA01101]; MoD [CBC/2B/0417_Annex C5],"We thank N.

The number of species in an ecosystem and their traits are key predictors of many ecosystem-level processes, such as rates of productivity, biomass sequestration and decomposition(4,5). Here we demonstrate short-term ecosystem-level effects of adaptive radiation in the threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) over the past 10,000 years. These fish have undergone recent parallel diversification in several lakes in coastal British Columbia, resulting in the formation of two specialized species (benthic and limnetic) from a generalist ancestor(6). Using a mesocosm experiment, we demonstrate that this diversification has strong effects on ecosystems, affecting prey community structure, total primary production, and the nature of dissolved organic materials that regulate the spectral properties of light transmission in the system. However, these ecosystem effects do not simply increase in their relative strength with increasing specialization and species richness; instead, they reflect the complex and indirect consequences of ecosystem engineering by sticklebacks. It is well known that ecological factors influence adaptive radiation(7,8). We demonstrate that adaptive radiation, even over short timescales, can have profound effects on ecosystems.","[Harmon, Luke J.; Des Roches, Simone] Univ Idaho, Dept Biol Sci, Moscow, ID 83844 USA; [Harmon, Luke J.; Matthews, Blake; Shurin, Jonathan B.; Schluter, Dolph] Univ British Columbia, Biodivers Res Ctr, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada; [Harmon, Luke J.; Matthews, Blake; Shurin, Jonathan B.; Schluter, Dolph] Univ British Columbia, Dept Zool, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada; [Matthews, Blake] EAWAG, CH-6047 Kastanienbaum, Switzerland; [Chase, Jonathan M.] Washington Univ, Dept Biol, St Louis, MO 63130 USA","Harmon, LJ (reprint author), Univ Idaho, Dept Biol Sci, Moscow, ID 83844 USA.",lukeh@uidaho.edu,"Matthews, Blake/B-5608-2009; Des Roches, Simone/A-4814-2011; Harmon, Luke/A-8225-2012","Matthews, Blake/0000-0001-9089-704X; Des Roches, Simone/0000-0002-5360-8197",,,,30,175,176,5,154,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,30-Apr,2009,458,7242,,,,,1167,1170,,10.1038/nature07974,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,441FL,WOS:000265754600047,19339968,No,,,11/20/17

The regulated aggregation behaviour of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, a simple animal with only 302 neurons, is an attractive system to analyse these circuits. Wild social strains of C. elegans aggregate in the presence of specific sensory cues, but solitary strains do not(1-4). Here we identify the RMG inter/motor neuron as the hub of a regulated circuit that controls aggregation and related behaviours. RMG is the central site of action of the neuropeptide receptor gene npr-1, which distinguishes solitary strains (high npr-1 activity) from wild social strains (low npr-1 activity); high RMG activity is essential for all aspects of social behaviour. Anatomical gap junctions connect RMG to several classes of sensory neurons known to promote aggregation, and to ASK sensory neurons, which are implicated in male attraction to hermaphrodite pheromones(5). We find that ASK neurons respond directly to pheromones, and that high RMG activity enhances ASK responses in social strains, causing hermaphrodite attraction to pheromones at concentrations that repel solitary hermaphrodites. The coordination of social behaviours by RMG suggests an anatomical hub-and-spoke model for sensory integration in aggregation, and points to functions for related circuit motifs in the C. elegans wiring diagram.","[Macosko, Evan Z.; Pokala, Navin; Feinberg, Evan H.; Chalasani, Sreekanth H.; Bargmann, Cornelia I.] Rockefeller Univ, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Lab Neural Circuits & Behav, New York, NY 10065 USA; [Butcher, Rebecca A.; Clardy, Jon] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Biol Chem & Mol Pharmacol, Boston, MA 02115 USA","Bargmann, CI (reprint author), Rockefeller Univ, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Lab Neural Circuits & Behav, 1230 York Ave, New York, NY 10065 USA.",cori@rockefeller.edu,,"Bargmann, Cornelia/0000-0002-8484-0618","Howard Hughes Medical Institute; Harold and Leila Y Mathers Charitable Foundation; Jensam Foundation; National Institute of Health [GM07739, CA24487, GM077943]","We thank L.

C. difficile-associated diseases are induced by antibiotic treatment or disruption of the normal gastrointestinal flora(3,4). Recently, morbidity and mortality resulting from C. difficile-associated diseases have increased significantly due to changes in the virulence of the causative strains and antibiotic usage patterns(1,2,5,6). Since 2002, epidemic toxinotype III NAP1/027 strains(1,2), which produce high levels of the major virulence factors, toxin A and toxin B, have emerged. These toxins have 63 % amino acid sequence similarity(7) and are members of the large clostridial glucosylating toxin family, which are monoglucosyltransferases that are pro-inflammatory, cytotoxic and enterotoxic in the human colon(8-10). Inside host cells, both toxins catalyse the transfer of glucose onto the Rho family of GTPases, leading to cell death(8,11). However, the role of these toxins in the context of a C. difficile infection is unknown. Here we describe the construction of isogenic tcdA and tcdB (encoding toxin A and B, respectively) mutants of a virulent C. difficile strain and their use in the hamster disease model to show that toxin B is a key virulence determinant. Previous studies showed that purified toxin A alone can induce most of the pathology observed after infection of hamsters with C. difficile(8,9,12) and that toxin B is not toxic in animals unless it is co-administered with toxin A, suggesting that the toxins act synergistically(12). Our work provides evidence that toxin B, not toxin A, is essential for virulence. Furthermore, it is clear that the importance of these toxins in the context of infection cannot be predicted exclusively from studies using purified toxins, reinforcing the importance of using the natural infection process to dissect the role of toxins in disease.","[Lyras, Dena; O'Connor, Jennifer R.; Howarth, Pauline M.; Carter, Glen P.; Phumoonna, Tongted; Poon, Rachael; Adams, Vicki; Rood, Julian I.] Monash Univ, Dept Microbiol, Australian Bacterial Pathogenesis Program, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia; [Poon, Rachael; Rood, Julian I.] Monash Univ, Dept Microbiol, Australian Res Council, Ctr Excellence Struct & Funct Microbial Genom, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia; [O'Connor, Jennifer R.; Sambol, Susan P.; Vedantam, Gayatri; Johnson, Stuart; Gerding, Dale N.] Hines VA Hosp, Med Serv, Hines, IL 60141 USA; [O'Connor, Jennifer R.; Sambol, Susan P.; Vedantam, Gayatri; Johnson, Stuart; Gerding, Dale N.] Hines VA Hosp, Res Serv, Hines, IL 60141 USA; Loyola Univ, Stritch Sch Med, Infect Dis Sect, Maywood, IL 60153 USA","Rood, JI (reprint author), Monash Univ, Dept Microbiol, Australian Bacterial Pathogenesis Program, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia.",julian.rood@med.monash.edu.au,"Rood, Julian/A-4858-2008","Rood, Julian/0000-0003-2126-7209; Carter, Glen/0000-0002-7306-9362; Adams, Vicki/0000-0002-1506-1864",Australian National Health and Medical Research Council [284214]; ARC Centre of Excellence in Structural and Functional Microbial Genomics; United States National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases [AIO57637]; United States Department of Veterans Affairs Research Service,"Research at Monash University was supported by Program Grant 284214 from the Australian National Health and Medical Research Council, funding from the ARC Centre of Excellence in Structural and Functional Microbial Genomics and grant AIO57637 from the United States National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.

However, the transformative therapeutic potential of short interfering RNA ( siRNA) has been stymied by a key obstacle-safe delivery to specified target cells in vivo(2). Macrophages are particularly attractive targets for RNA interference therapy because they promote pathogenic inflammatory responses in diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, atherosclerosis, inflammatory bowel disease and diabetes(3). Here we report the engineering of beta 1,3-D-glucan-encapsulated siRNA particles (GeRPs) as efficient oral delivery vehicles that potently silence genes in mouse macrophages in vitro and in vivo. Oral gavage of mice with GeRPs containing as little as 20 mu g kg(-1) siRNA directed against tumour necrosis factor alpha (Tnf-alpha) depleted its messenger RNA in macrophages recovered from the peritoneum, spleen, liver and lung, and lowered serum Tnf-a levels. Screening with GeRPs for inflammation genes revealed that the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase kinase 4 (Map4k4) is a previously unknown mediator of cytokine expression. Importantly, silencing Map4k4 in macrophages in vivo protected mice from lipopolysaccharide-induced lethality by inhibiting Tnf-alpha and interleukin-1 beta production. This technology defines a new strategy for oral delivery of siRNA to attenuate inflammatory responses in human disease.","[Aouadi, Myriam; Tesz, Gregory J.; Nicoloro, Sarah M.; Wang, Mengxi; Chouinard, My; Soto, Ernesto; Ostroff, Gary R.; Czech, Michael P.] Univ Massachusetts, Sch Med, Program Mol Med, Worcester, MA 01605 USA","Czech, MP (reprint author), Univ Massachusetts, Sch Med, Program Mol Med, Worcester, MA 01605 USA.",gary.ostroff@umassmed.edu; michael.czech@umassmed.edu,,,The University of Massachusetts Diabetes and Endocrinology Center [DK 32520]; Diabetes Genome Anatomy Project [DK 60837]; Commonwealth Medicine; NIH [DK 30898],"We appreciate critical reading of the manuscript and suggestions by C.

TLR stimulation activates complex gene expression networks that regulate the magnitude and duration of the immune reaction. Here we identify the TLR-inducible gene Zc3h12a as an immune response modifier that has an essential role in preventing immune disorders. Zc3h12a-deficient mice suffered from severe anaemia, and most died within 12 weeks. Zc3h12a(-/-) mice also showed augmented serum immunoglobulin levels and autoantibody production, together with a greatly increased number of plasma cells, as well as infiltration of plasma cells to the lung. Most Zc3h12a(-/-) splenic T cells showed effector/memory characteristics and produced interferon-gamma in response to T-cell receptor stimulation. Macrophages from Zc3h12a (-/-) mice showed highly increased production of interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-12p40 (also known as IL12b), but not TNF, in response to TLR ligands. Although the activation of TLR signalling pathways was normal, Il6 messenger RNA decay was severely impaired in Zc3h12a (-/-) macrophages. Overexpression of Zc3h12a accelerated Il6 mRNA degradation via its 3'-untranslated region (UTR), and destabilized RNAs with 3'-UTRs for genes including Il6, Il12p40 and the calcitonin receptor gene Calcr. Zc3h12a contains a putative amino-terminal nuclease domain, and the expressed protein had RNase activity, consistent with a role in the decay of Il6 mRNA. Together, these results indicate that Zc3h12a is an essential RNase that prevents immune disorders by directly controlling the stability of a set of inflammatory genes.","[Matsushita, Kazufumi; Takeuchi, Osamu; Kumagai, Yutaro; Kawagoe, Tatsukata; Miyake, Tohru; Satoh, Takashi; Kato, Hiroki; Akira, Shizuo] Osaka Univ, Host Def Lab, Suita, Osaka 5650871, Japan; [Standley, Daron M.] Osaka Univ, Lab Syst Immunol, WPI Immunol Frontier Res Ctr, Suita, Osaka 5650871, Japan; [Matsushita, Kazufumi; Takeuchi, Osamu; Kumagai, Yutaro; Kawagoe, Tatsukata; Miyake, Tohru; Satoh, Takashi; Kato, Hiroki; Akira, Shizuo] Osaka Univ, Microbial Dis Res Inst, Suita, Osaka 5650871, Japan; [Tsujimura, Tohru] Hyogo Coll Med, Dept Pathol, Nishinomiya, Hyogo 6638501, Japan; [Nakamura, Haruki] Osaka Univ, Inst Prot Res, Res Ctr Struct & Funct Prote, Suita, Osaka 5650871, Japan","Akira, S (reprint author), Osaka Univ, Host Def Lab, 3-1 Yamada Oka, Suita, Osaka 5650871, Japan.",sakira@biken.osaka-u.ac.jp,"Akira, Shizuo/C-3134-2009; Takeuchi, Osamu/D-6007-2011; Standley, Daron/D-2343-2009",,"Japanese Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology; Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare in Japan; Global Center of Excellence Program of Japan; NIH [P01 AI070167]","We thank all colleagues in our laboratory, E.

Toll-like receptor (TLR) 4 and myeloid differentiation factor 2 (MD-2) form a heterodimer that recognizes a common 'pattern' in structurally diverse LPS molecules. To understand the ligand specificity and receptor activation mechanism of the TLR4-MD-2-LPS complex we determined its crystal structure. LPS binding induced the formation of an m-shaped receptor multimer composed of two copies of the TLR4-MD-2-LPS complex arranged symmetrically. LPS interacts with a large hydrophobic pocket in MD-2 and directly bridges the two components of the multimer. Five of the six lipid chains of LPS are buried deep inside the pocket and the remaining chain is exposed to the surface of MD-2, forming a hydrophobic interaction with the conserved phenylalanines of TLR4. The F126 loop of MD-2 undergoes localized structural change and supports this core hydrophobic interface by making hydrophilic interactions with TLR4. Comparison with the structures of tetra-acylated antagonists bound to MD-2 indicates that two other lipid chains in LPS displace the phosphorylated glucosamine backbone by similar to 5 angstrom towards the solvent area(2,3). This structural shift allows phosphate groups of LPS to contribute to receptor multimerization by forming ionic interactions with a cluster of positively charged residues in TLR4 and MD-2. The TLR4-MD-2-LPS structure illustrates the remarkable versatility of the ligand recognition mechanisms employed by the TLR family(4,5), which is essential for defence against diverse microbial infection.","[Park, Beom Seok; Song, Dong Hyun; Kim, Ho Min; Choi, Byong-Seok; Lee, Jie-Oh] Korea Adv Inst Sci & Technol, Dept Chem, Taejon 305701, South Korea; [Lee, Jie-Oh] Korea Adv Inst Sci & Technol, Inst BioCentury, Taejon 305701, South Korea; [Lee, Hayyoung] Chungnam Natl Univ, Sch Biosci & Biotechnol, Dept Biol, Taejon 305764, South Korea","Lee, JO (reprint author), Korea Adv Inst Sci & Technol, Dept Chem, Taejon 305701, South Korea.",jieoh.lee@kaist.ac.kr,"Choi, Byong-Seok/C-1937-2011; Lee, Jie-Oh/C-1581-2011; Kim, Ho Min/G-2712-2011",,"Ministry of Education, Science and Technology of Korea","We thank the staff of beamline 4A at the Pohang Accelerator Laboratory and beamline ID23-2 at ESRF for help with data collection.

It is associated with heterozygous missense mutations in indian hedgehog (IHH)(1,2). Hedgehog proteins are important morphogens for a wide range of developmental processes(3,4). The capacity and range of signalling is thought to be regulated by its interaction with the receptor PTCH1 and antagonist HIP1. Here we show that a BDA1 mutation (E95K) in Ihh impairs the interaction of IHH with PTCH1 and HIP1. This is consistent with a recent paper showing that BDA1 mutations cluster in a calcium-binding site essential for the interaction with its receptor and cell-surface partners(5). Furthermore, we show that in a mouse model that recapitulates the E95K mutation, there is a change in the potency and range of signalling.

Infection of ESCs by the murine leukaemia viruses (MLVs) results in the normal establishment of integrated proviral DNA, but this DNA is then transcriptionally silenced, preventing further viral spread. The repression is largely mediated by transacting factors that recognize a conserved sequence element termed the primer binding site, an 18-base pair sequence complementary to the 39 end of a cellular transfer RNA(2-6). A specific tRNA is annealed to the primer binding site sequence of the viral genomic RNA, and is used to prime DNA synthesis(7). This same sequence in the context of the integrated proviral DNA is targeted for silencing in ESCs. We have recently shown that a large protein complex binding to the primer binding site in ESCs contains TRIM28 (refs 8, 9), a well-characterized transcriptional co-repressor(10-12). An important question remains as to the identity of the factor that directly recognizes integrated retroviral DNAs and recruits TRIM28 to mediate their specific silencing. Here we identify the zinc finger protein ZFP809 as the recognition molecule that bridges the integrated proviral DNA and TRIM28. We show that expression of ZFP809 is sufficient to render even differentiated cells highly resistant to MLV infection. Furthermore, we demonstrate that ZFP809 is able to potently block transcription from DNA constructs of human T-cell lymphotropic virus-1 (HTLV-1), which use the same primer tRNA. These results identify ZFP809 as a DNA-binding factor that specifically recognizes a large subset of mammalian retroviruses and retroelements, targeting them for transcriptional silencing. We propose that ZFP809 evolved as a stem-cell-specific retroviral restriction factor, and therefore constitutes a new component of the intrinsic immune system of stem cells.","[Wolf, Daniel; Goff, Stephen P.] Columbia Univ, Coll Phys & Surg, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Dept Biochem & Mol Biophys, New York, NY 10032 USA","Goff, SP (reprint author), Columbia Univ, Coll Phys & Surg, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Dept Biochem & Mol Biophys, HHSC 1310,701 W 168th St, New York, NY 10032 USA.",spg1@columbia.edu,"Goff, Stephen/K-6337-2014","Goff, Stephen/0000-0003-0693-5547",National Cancer Institute [R37 CA 30488],"This work was supported by Public Health Service grant R37 CA 30488 from the National Cancer Institute.

We assigned putative loss-of-function phenotypes to 21.2% of the protein-coding Drosophila genes. Using secondary assays, we identified 6 new genes involved in asymmetric cell division and 23 novel genes regulating the Notch signalling pathway. By integrating our phenotypic results with protein interaction data, we constructed a genome-wide, functionally validated interaction network governing Notch signalling and asymmetric cell division. We used clustering algorithms to identify nuclear import pathways and the COP9 signallosome as Notch regulators.

A recent study(5) of young asteroid families concluded that they suffered only minimal space weathering. Here we report additional observations of those families, revealing that space weathering must be a very rapid process-the final colour of a silicate-rich asteroid is acquired shortly after its 'birth' (within 10(6) years of undergoing a catastrophic collision). This rapid timescale favours solar wind implantation as the main mechanism of space weathering, as laboratory experiments have shown that it is the most rapid of several competing processes. We further demonstrate the necessity to take account of composition when evaluating weathering effectiveness, as both laboratory and asteroid data show an apparent dependence of weathering on olivine abundance. The rapid colour change that we find implies that colour trends seen among asteroids are most probably due to compositional or surface-particle-size properties, rather than to different relative ages. Apparently fresh surfaces most frequently seen among small near-Earth asteroids may be the result of tidal shaking that rejuvenates their surfaces during planetary encounters(6,7).","[Vernazza, P.] European Space Agcy, Res & Sci Support Dept, NL-2201 AZ Noordwijk, Netherlands; [Binzel, R.

In the context of quantum information, quantum error correction techniques have been developed to correct these errors, but resource requirements are extraordinary. The realization of a physically tractable quantum information system will therefore be facilitated if qubit (quantum bit) error rates are far below the so-called fault-tolerance error threshold(1), predicted to be of the order of 10(-3)-10(-6). The need to realize such low error rates motivates a search for alternative strategies to suppress dephasing in quantum systems(2). Here we experimentally demonstrate massive suppression of qubit error rates by the application of optimized dynamical decoupling(3-8) pulse sequences, using a model quantum system capable of simulating a variety of qubit technologies. We demonstrate an analytically derived pulse sequence(9), UDD, and find novel sequences through active, real-time experimental feedback. The latter sequences are tailored to maximize error suppression without the need for a priori knowledge of the ambient noise environment, and are capable of suppressing errors by orders of magnitude compared to other existing sequences (including the benchmark multi-pulse spin echo(10,11)). Our work includes the extension of a treatment to predict qubit decoherence(12,13) under realistic conditions, yielding strong agreement between experimental data and theory for arbitrary pulse sequences incorporating nonidealized control pulses. These results demonstrate the robustness of qubit memory error suppression through dynamical decoupling techniques across a variety of qubit technologies(11,14-16).","[Biercuk, Michael J.; Uys, Hermann; VanDevender, Aaron P.; Shiga, Nobuyasu; Itano, Wayne M.; Bollinger, John J.] NIST, Div Time & Frequency, Boulder, CO 80305 USA; [Biercuk, Michael J.] Georgia Inst Technol, Atlanta, GA USA; [Uys, Hermann] CSIR, ZA-0001 Pretoria, South Africa","Biercuk, MJ (reprint author), NIST, Div Time & Frequency, Boulder, CO 80305 USA.",biercuk@boulder.nist.gov,"Biercuk, Michael/B-4768-2010",,IARPA; NIST; Georgia Tech.; CSIR,"We thank L.

This phenomenon is well known from the macroscopic world: a water jet is deflected when approached by a charged object. This fundamental mechanism is exploited in a variety of contexts-for example, trapping microscopic particles in an optical tweezer(1), where the trapping force is controlled via the intensity of a laser beam, or dielectrophoresis(2), where electric fields are used to manipulate particles in liquids. Here we extend the underlying concept to the rapidly evolving field of nanoelectromechanical systems(3,4) (NEMS). A broad range of possible applications are anticipated for these systems(5,6,7), but drive and detection schemes for nanomechanical motion still need to be optimized(8,9). Our approach is based on the application of dielectric gradient forces for the controlled and local transduction of NEMS. Using a set of on-chip electrodes to create an electric field gradient, we polarize a dielectric resonator and subject it to an attractive force that can be modulated at high frequencies. This universal actuation scheme is efficient, broadband and scalable. It also separates the driving scheme from the driven mechanical element, allowing for arbitrary polarizable materials and thus potentially ultralow dissipation NEMS(10). In addition, it enables simple voltage tuning of the mechanical resonance over a wide frequency range, because the dielectric force depends strongly on the resonator-electrode separation. We use the modulation of the resonance frequency to demonstrate parametric actuation(11,12). Moreover, we reverse the actuation principle to realize dielectric detection, thus allowing universal transduction of NEMS. We expect this combination to be useful both in the study of fundamental principles and in applications such as signal processing and sensing.","[Unterreithmeier, Quirin P.; Weig, Eva M.; Kotthaus, Joerg P.] Univ Munich, Fak Phys, D-80539 Munich, Germany; [Unterreithmeier, Quirin P.; Weig, Eva M.; Kotthaus, Joerg P.] Univ Munich, CeNS, D-80539 Munich, Germany","Kotthaus, JP (reprint author), Univ Munich, Fak Phys, Geschwister Scholl Pl 1, D-80539 Munich, Germany.",kotthaus@lmu.de,"Kotthaus, Jorg/A-7674-2010; Weig, Eva/E-9973-2010",,Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft [Ko 416/18]; German Excellence Initiative via the Nanosystems Initiative Munich (NIM); LMUexcellent; LMUinnovativ,"Financial support by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft via project Ko 416/18, the German Excellence Initiative via the Nanosystems Initiative Munich (NIM) and LMUexcellent as well as LMUinnovativ is gratefully acknowledged.",,30,124,124,1,46,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,23-Apr,2009,458,7241,,,,,1001,1004,,10.1038/nature07932,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,436KL,WOS:000265412900036,19396140,No,,,11/20/17

One example is the bonding of two such atoms by multipole forces to form Rydberg-Rydberg molecules with very large internuclear distances(1-3). Notably, bonding interactions can also arise from the low-energy scattering of a Rydberg electron with negative scattering length from a ground-state atom(4,5). In this case, the scattering-induced attractive interaction binds the ground-state atom to the Rydberg atom at a well-localized position within the Rydberg electron wavefunction and thereby yields giant molecules that can have internuclear separations of several thousand Bohr radii(6-8). Here we report the spectroscopic characterization of such exotic molecular states formed by rubidium Rydberg atoms that are in the spherically symmetric s state and have principal quantum numbers, n, between 34 and 40. We find that the spectra of the vibrational ground state and of the first excited state of the Rydberg molecule, the rubidium dimer Rb(5s)-Rb(ns), agree well with simple model predictions. The data allow us to extract the s-wave scattering length for scattering between the Rydberg electron and the ground-state atom, Rb(5s), in the low-energy regime (kinetic energy, <100meV), and to determine the lifetimes and the polarizabilities of the Rydberg molecules. Given our successful characterization of s-wave bound Rydberg states, we anticipate that p-wave bound states(9), trimer states(10) and bound states involving a Rydberg electron with large angular momentum-so-called trilobite molecules(5)-will also be realized and directly probed in the near future.","[Bendkowsky, Vera; Butscher, Bjoern; Nipper, Johannes; Shaffer, James P.; Loew, Robert; Pfau, Tilman] Univ Stuttgart, Phys Inst 5, D-70569 Stuttgart, Germany; [Shaffer, James P.] Univ Oklahoma, Homer L Dodge Dept Phys & Astron, Norman, OK 73072 USA","Bendkowsky, V (reprint author), Univ Stuttgart, Phys Inst 5, Pfaffenwaldring 57, D-70569 Stuttgart, Germany.",v.bendkowsky@physik.uni-stuttgart.de; t.pfau@physik.uni-stuttgart.de,"Pfau, Tilman/G-1774-2011; Loew, Robert/I-8206-2014",,Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft [PF 381/4-1]; Landesstiftung Baden-Wurttemberg; Carl Zeiss foundation; Alexander von Humboldt foundation,"We would like to thank C.

The regional patterns and causes of terrestrial carbon sources and sinks, however, remain uncertain(1-3). With increasing scientific and political interest in regional aspects of the global carbon cycle, there is a strong impetus to better understand the carbon balance of China(1-3). This is not only because China is the world's most populous country and the largest emitter of fossil-fuel CO2 into the atmosphere(4), but also because it has experienced regionally distinct land-use histories and climate trends(1), which together control the carbon budget of its ecosystems. Here we analyse the current terrestrial carbon balance of China and its driving mechanisms during the 1980s and 1990s using three different methods: biomass and soil carbon inventories extrapolated by satellite greenness measurements, ecosystem models and atmospheric inversions. The three methods produce similar estimates of a net carbon sink in the range of 0.19-0.26 Pg carbon (PgC) per year, which is smaller than that in the conterminous United States(5) but comparable to that in geographic Europe(6). We find that northeast China is a net source of CO2 to the atmosphere owing to overharvesting and degradation of forests. By contrast, southern China accounts for more than 65 per cent of the carbon sink, which can be attributed to regional climate change, large-scale plantation programmes active since the 1980s and shrub recovery. Shrub recovery is identified as the most uncertain factor contributing to the carbon sink. Our data and model results together indicate that China's terrestrial ecosystems absorbed 28-37 per cent of its cumulated fossil carbon emissions during the 1980s and 1990s.","[Piao, Shilong; Fang, Jingyun; Wang, Tao] Peking Univ, Dept Ecol, Coll Urban & Environm Sci, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China; [Piao, Shilong; Fang, Jingyun; Wang, Tao] Peking Univ, Key Lab Earth Surface Proc, Minist Educ, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China; [Ciais, Philippe] UMR CEA CNRS UVSQ, LSCE, F-91191 Gif Sur Yvette, France; [Peylin, Philippe] Lab Biogeochim Isotop, F-78026 Thiverval Grignon, France; [Huang, Yao] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Atmospher Phys, State Key Lab Atmospher Boundary Layer Phys & Atm, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China; [Sitch, Stephen] Met Off Hadley Ctr JCHMR, Wallingford OX10 8BB, Oxon, England","Piao, SL (reprint author), Peking Univ, Dept Ecol, Coll Urban & Environm Sci, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China.",slpiao@pku.edu.cn; jyfang@urban.pku.edu.cn,"; Wang, ZF/D-7202-2012; Huang, Yao/O-6832-2014; Sitch, Stephen/F-8034-2015; wang, tao/H-2830-2013; Vuichard, Nicolas/A-6629-2011","Peylin, Philippe/0000-0001-9335-6994; Wang, ZF/0000-0002-7062-6012; Sitch, Stephen/0000-0003-1821-8561; wang, tao/0000-0003-4792-5898; ","Foundation for the Author of National Excellent Doctoral Dissertation of China [FANEDD-200737]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [90711002, 30721140306]; Knowledge Innovation Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences [KZCX1-SW-01-13]; DECC [GA0110]; MoD [CBC/2B/0417_Annex C5]","The authors wish to thank P.

However, recent theoretical and observational studies have demonstrated that photosynthesis is also more efficient under diffuse light conditions(1-5). Changes in cloud cover or atmospheric aerosol loadings, arising from either volcanic or anthropogenic emissions, alter both the total photosynthetically active radiation reaching the surface and the fraction of this radiation that is diffuse, with uncertain overall effects on global plant productivity and the land carbon sink. Here we estimate the impact of variations in diffuse fraction on the land carbon sink using a global model modified to account for the effects of variations in both direct and diffuse radiation on canopy photosynthesis. We estimate that variations in diffuse fraction, associated largely with the 'global dimming' period(6-8), enhanced the land carbon sink by approximately one-quarter between 1960 and 1999. However, under a climate mitigation scenario for the twenty-first century in which sulphate aerosols decline before atmospheric CO(2) is stabilized, this 'diffuse-radiation' fertilization effect declines rapidly to near zero by the end of the twenty-first century.","[Mercado, Lina M.; Huntingford, Chris] Ctr Ecol & Hydrol, Wallingford OX10 8BB, Oxon, England; [Bellouin, Nicolas; Sitch, Stephen; Boucher, Olivier] Met Off Hadley Ctr, Exeter EX1 3PB, Devon, England; [Wild, Martin] ETH, Inst Atmospher & Climate Sci, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland; [Cox, Peter M.] Univ Exeter, Sch Engn Comp Sci & Math, Exeter EX4 4QF, Devon, England","Mercado, LM (reprint author), Ctr Ecol & Hydrol, Wallingford OX10 8BB, Oxon, England.",lmme@ceh.ac.uk,"Mercado, Lina /A-1890-2012; Boucher, Olivier/J-5810-2012; Wild, Martin/J-8977-2012; Boucher, Olivier/K-7483-2012; Sitch, Stephen/F-8034-2015; Cox, Peter/B-3299-2012; Huntingford, Chris/A-4307-2008","Boucher, Olivier/0000-0003-2328-5769; Boucher, Olivier/0000-0003-2328-5769; Sitch, Stephen/0000-0003-1821-8561; Huntingford, Chris/0000-0002-5941-7770; Bellouin, Nicolas/0000-0003-2109-9559","UK Natural Environment Research Council; UK Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra); UK Ministry of Defence (MoD) [GA01101, CBC/2B/0417_Annex C5]; Swiss NCCR Climate","We thank A.

However, recent empirical work has revealed that ecological networks are highly structured(5-7), and the lack of a theory that takes into account the structure of interactions precludes further assessment of the implications of such network patterns for biodiversity. Here we use a combination of analytical and empirical approaches to quantify the influence of network architecture on the number of coexisting species. As a case study we consider mutualistic networks between plants and their animal pollinators or seed dispersers(5,8-11). These networks have been found to be highly nested(5), with the more specialist species interacting only with proper subsets of the species that interact with the more generalist. We show that nestedness reduces effective interspecific competition and enhances the number of coexisting species. Furthermore, we show that a nested network will naturally emerge if new species are more likely to enter the community where they have minimal competitive load. Nested networks seem to occur in many biological and social contexts(12-14), suggesting that our results are relevant in a wide range of fields.","[Fortuna, Miguel A.; Bascompte, Jordi] CSIC, Estac Biol Donana, Integrat Ecol Grp, Seville 41092, Spain; [Bastolla, Ugo; Pascual-Garcia, Alberto] Univ Autonoma Madrid, CSIC, Ctr Mol Biol, E-28049 Madrid, Spain; [Ferrera, Antonio; Luque, Bartolo] Univ Politecn Madrid, Dept Matemat Aplicada & Estadist, ETSI Aeronaut, E-28040 Madrid, Spain","Bascompte, J (reprint author), CSIC, Estac Biol Donana, Integrat Ecol Grp, C Amer Vespucio S-N, Seville 41092, Spain.",bascompte@ebd.csic.es,"Fortuna, Miguel/D-4154-2013; Bastolla, Ugo/H-6330-2015; CSIC, EBD Donana/C-4157-2011; Bascompte, Jordi/B-7596-2008","Fortuna, Miguel/0000-0002-8374-1941; Bastolla, Ugo/0000-0001-9342-4678; CSIC, EBD Donana/0000-0003-4318-6602; Bascompte, Jordi/0000-0002-0108-6411; Pascual Garcia, Alberto/0000-0002-8444-3196",Spanish Ministry of Science and Technology; European Heads of Research Councils; European Science Foundation; EC; Ramon Areces Foundation,"We thank P.

Recent phylogenetic studies using morphological and molecular evidence support pinniped monophyly, and suggest a sister relationship with ursoids(1,2) (for example bears) or musteloids(3-7) (the clade that includes skunks, badgers, weasels and otters). Although the position of pinnipeds within modern carnivores appears moderately well resolved, fossil evidence of the morphological steps leading from a terrestrial ancestor to the modern marine forms has been weak or contentious. The earliest well-represented fossil pinniped is Enaliarctos, a marine form with flippers, which had appeared on the northwestern shores of North America by the early Miocene epoch(8,9). Here we report the discovery of a nearly complete skeleton of a new semi-aquatic carnivore from an early Miocene lake deposit in Nunavut, Canada, that represents a morphological link in early pinniped evolution. The new taxon retains a long tail and the proportions of its fore-and hindlimbs are more similar to those of modern terrestrial carnivores than to modern pinnipeds. Morphological traits indicative of semi-aquatic adaptation include a forelimb with a prominent deltopectoral ridge on the humerus, a posterodorsally expanded scapula, a pelvis with relatively short ilium, a shortened femur and flattened phalanges, suggestive of webbing. The new fossil shows evidence of pinniped affinities and similarities to the early Oligocene Amphicticeps from Asia and the late Oligocene and Miocene Potamotherium from Europe. The discovery suggests that the evolution of pinnipeds included a freshwater transitional phase, and may support the hypothesis that the Arctic was an early centre of pinniped evolution.","[Rybczynski, Natalia] Canadian Museum Nat, Ottawa, ON K1P 6P4, Canada; [Dawson, Mary R.] Carnegie Museum Nat Hist, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA; [Tedford, Richard H.] Amer Museum Nat Hist, Div Paleontol, New York, NY 10024 USA","Rybczynski, N (reprint author), Canadian Museum Nat, POB 3443 STN D, Ottawa, ON K1P 6P4, Canada.",nrybczynski@mus-nature.ca,,,,,,30,41,44,2,45,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,23-Apr,2009,458,7241,,,,,1021,1024,,10.1038/nature07985,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,436KL,WOS:000265412900041,19396145,No,,,11/20/17

In particular, we have developed and characterized two optoXRs that selectively recruit distinct, targeted signalling pathways in response to light. The two optoXRs exerted opposing effects on spike firing in nucleus accumbens in vivo, and precisely timed optoXR photostimulation in nucleus accumbens by itself sufficed to drive conditioned place preference in freely moving mice. The optoXR approach allows testing of hypotheses regarding the causal impact of biochemical signalling in behaving mammals, in a targetable and temporally precise manner.","[Airan, Raag D.; Thompson, Kimberly R.; Fenno, Lief E.; Bernstein, Hannah; Deisseroth, Karl] Stanford Univ, Dept Bioengn, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Deisseroth, Karl] Stanford Univ, Dept Psychiat & Behav Sci, Stanford, CA 94305 USA","Deisseroth, K (reprint author), Stanford Univ, Dept Bioengn, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",deissero@stanford.edu,,,NIH/NIMH National Research Service Award; Stanford Medical Scientist Training Program; NARSAD Young Investigator Award; CIRM; McKnight; Coulter; Klingenstein; Keck; NSF; NIDA; NIH Pioneer Award; Albert Yu and Mary Bechmann Foundation; Kinetics Foundation,"We thank B.

Here we show that some Caenorhabditis elegans wild strains switch between two foraging behaviours in response to subtle changes in ambient oxygen. This finely tuned switch is conferred by a naturally variable hexacoordinated globin, GLB-5. GLB-5 acts with the atypical soluble guanylate cyclases(1-3), which are a different type of oxygen binding protein, to tune the dynamic range of oxygen-sensing neurons close to atmospheric (21%) concentrations. Calcium imaging indicates that one group of these neurons is activated when oxygen rises towards 21%, and is inhibited as oxygen drops below 21%. The soluble guanylate cyclase GCY-35 is required for high oxygen to activate the neurons; GLB-5 provides inhibitory input when oxygen decreases below 21%. Together, these oxygen binding proteins tune neuronal and behavioural responses to a narrow oxygen concentration range close to atmospheric levels. The effect of the glb-5 gene on oxygen sensing and foraging is modified by the naturally variable neuropeptide receptor npr-1 (refs 4, 5), providing insights into how polygenic variation reshapes neural circuit function.","[Persson, Annelie; Gross, Einav; Laurent, Patrick; Busch, Karl Emanuel; Bretes, Hugo; de Bono, Mario] MRC, Mol Biol Lab, Cambridge CB2 0QH, England; [Persson, Annelie] Univ Gothenburg, Dept Cell & Mol Biol, S-40530 Gothenburg, Sweden","de Bono, M (reprint author), MRC, Mol Biol Lab, Hills Rd, Cambridge CB2 0QH, England.",debono@mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk,,"Busch, Karl Emanuel/0000-0001-7886-3226; de Bono, Mario/0000-0001-8347-0443",Medical Research Council; EU Marie Curie Actions; European Molecular Biology Organization; Fondation Wiener-Anspach,"We thank the Caenorhabditis Genetics Center, A.

Indeed, recent trials of a candidate vaccine and microbicide have been disappointing, both for want of efficacy and concerns about increased rates of transmission(2-4). Nonetheless, studies of vaginal transmission in the simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV)-rhesus macaque (Macacca mulatta) model point to opportunities at the earliest stages of infection in which a vaccine or microbicide might be protective, by limiting the expansion of infected founder populations at the portal of entry(5,6). Here we show in this SIV-macaque model, that an outside-in endocervical mucosal signalling system, involving MIP-3 alpha (also known as CCL20), plasmacytoid dendritic cells and CCR5(+) cell-attracting chemokines produced by these cells, in combination with the innate immune and inflammatory responses to infection in both cervix and vagina, recruits CD4(+) T cells to fuel this obligate expansion. We then show that glycerol monolaurate-a widely used antimicrobial compound(7) with inhibitory activity against the production of MIP-3 alpha and other proinflammatory cytokines(8)-can inhibit mucosal signalling and the innate and inflammatory response to HIV-1 and SIV in vitro, and in vivo it can protect rhesus macaques from acute infection despite repeated intra-vaginal exposure to high doses of SIV. This new approach, plausibly linked to interfering with innate host responses that recruit the target cells necessary to establish systemic infection, opens a promising new avenue for the development of effective interventions to blockHIV-1 mucosal transmission.","[Li, Qingsheng; Schlievert, Patrick M.; Duan, Lijie; Brosnahan, Amanda J.; Southern, Peter J.; Haase, Ashley T.] Univ Minnesota, Dept Microbiol, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA; [Estes, Jacob D.; Lifson, Jeffrey D.] NCI, AIDS & Canc Virus Program, Sci Applicat Int Corp Frederick Inc, Frederick, MD 21702 USA; [Reilly, Cavan S.] Univ Minnesota, Sch Publ Hlth, Div Biostat, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA; [Peterson, Marnie L.] Univ Minnesota, Coll Pharm, Dept Expt & Clin Pharmacol, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA; [Schultz-Darken, Nancy; Brunner, Kevin G.; Nephew, Karla R.] Univ Wisconsin, Wisconsin Natl Primate Res Ctr, Madison, WI 53715 USA; [Pambuccian, Stefan] Univ Minnesota, Sch Med, Dept Lab Med & Pathol, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA; [Carlis, John V.] Univ Minnesota, Inst Technol, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA","Haase, AT (reprint author), Univ Minnesota, Dept Microbiol, MMC 196,420 Delaware St SE, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA.",haase001@umn.edu,,,"National Institute of Health (NIH) [R21 AI071976, P01 AI066314]; National Cancer Institute, NIH [N01-CO-12400, HHSN266200400088C]; National Center for Research Resources [P51 RR000167]; Research Facilities Improvement Program [RR15459-01, RR020141-01]","We thank C.

In cystic fibrosis, chronic infection and dysregulated neutrophilic inflammation lead to progressive airway destruction. The severity of cystic fibrosis lung disease has considerable heritability, independent of CFTR genotype(1). To identify genetic modifiers, here we performed a genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism scan in one cohort of cystic fibrosis patients, replicating top candidates in an independent cohort. This approach identified IFRD1 as a modifier of cystic fibrosis lung disease severity. IFRD1 is a histone-deacetylase-dependent transcriptional co-regulator expressed during terminal neutrophil differentiation. Neutrophils, but not macrophages, from Ifrd1-deficient mice showed blunted effector function, associated with decreased NF-kappa B p65 transactivation. In vivo, IFRD1 deficiency caused delayed bacterial clearance from the airway, but also less inflammation and disease-a phenotype primarily dependent on haematopoietic cell expression, or lack of expression, of IFRD1. In humans, IFRD1 polymorphisms were significantly associated with variation in neutrophil effector function. These data indicate that IFRD1 modulates the pathogenesis of cystic fibrosis lung disease through the regulation of neutrophil effector function.","[Gu, YuanYuan; Harley, Isaac T.

The ability of peripheral alpha beta T cells to recognize MHC is at least partly determined by MHC-dependent thymic selection, by which an immature T cell survives only if its TCR can recognize self MHC(2-7). This process may allow MHC-reactive TCRs to be selected from a repertoire with completely random and unbiased specificities. However, analysis of thymocytes before positive selection indicated that TCR proteins might have a predetermined ability to bind MHC(8-11). Here we show that specific germline-encoded amino acids in the TCR promote 'generic' MHC recognition and control thymic selection. In mice expressing single, rearranged TCR beta-chains, individual mutation of amino acids in the complementarity-determining region (CDR) 2 beta to Ala reduced development of the entire TCR repertoire. Altogether, these results show that thymic selection is controlled by germline-encoded MHC contact points in the alpha beta TCR and indicate that the diversity of the peripheral T-cell repertoire is enhanced by this 'built-in' specificity.","[Scott-Browne, James P.; White, Janice; Kappler, John W.; Gapin, Laurent; Marrack, Philippa] Natl Jewish Hlth & Univ Colorado Denver, Integrated Dept Immunol, Denver, CO 80206 USA; [Kappler, John W.; Marrack, Philippa] Univ Colorado Denver, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Aurora, CO 80220 USA; [Kappler, John W.; Marrack, Philippa] Univ Colorado Denver, Dept Med, Aurora, CO 80220 USA; [Kappler, John W.] Univ Colorado Denver, Dept Pharmacol, Aurora, CO 80220 USA; [Kappler, John W.] Univ Colorado Denver, Program Biomol Struct, Aurora, CO 80220 USA; [Marrack, Philippa] Univ Colorado Denver, Dept Biochem & Mol Genet, Aurora, CO 80220 USA","Marrack, P (reprint author), Natl Jewish Hlth & Univ Colorado Denver, Integrated Dept Immunol, Denver, CO 80206 USA.",james.scott-browne@ucdenver.edu; marrackp@njhealth.org,,,"National Institutes of Health [AI18785, AI22295, AI057485]; NIH [T32 AI07405]","Acknowledgements We thank E.

The high prevalence, lack of an effective vaccine, and absence of specific treatment conspire to make dengue fever a global public health threat(1,2). Given their compact genomes, dengue viruses (DENV-1-4) and other flaviviruses probably require an extensive number of host factors; however, only a limited number of human, and an even smaller number of insect host factors, have been identified(3-10). Here we identify insect host factors required for DENV-2 propagation, by carrying out a genome-wide RNA interference screen in Drosophila melanogaster cells using a well-established 22,632 double-stranded RNA library. This screen identified 116 candidate dengue virus host factors (DVHFs). Although some were previously associated with flaviviruses (for example, V-ATPases and alpha-glucosidases)(3-5,7,9,10), most of the DVHFs were newly implicated in dengue virus propagation. The dipteran DVHFs had 82 readily recognizable human homologues and, using a targeted short-interfering-RNA screen, we showed that 42 of these are human DVHFs. This indicates notable conservation of required factors between dipteran and human hosts. This work suggests new approaches to control infection in the insect vector and the mammalian host.","[Sessions, October M.; Robinson, Timothy J.; Pearson, James L.; Garcia-Blanco, Mariano A.] Duke Univ, Med Ctr, Dept Mol Genet & Microbiol, Durham, NC 27710 USA; [Sessions, October M.; Barrows, Nicholas J.; Pearson, James L.; Garcia-Blanco, Mariano A.] Duke Univ, Med Ctr, Ctr RNA Biol, Durham, NC 27710 USA; [Barrows, Nicholas J.; Pearson, James L.; Garcia-Blanco, Mariano A.] Duke Univ, Med Ctr, Duke RNAi Facil, Durham, NC 27710 USA; [Barrows, Nicholas J.] Duke Univ, Med Ctr, Inst Genome Sci & Policy, Durham, NC 27710 USA; [Robinson, Timothy J.] Duke Univ, Med Ctr, Med Scientist Training Program, Durham, NC 27710 USA; [Robinson, Timothy J.] Duke Univ, Med Ctr, Program Mol Canc Biol, Durham, NC 27710 USA; [Souza-Neto, Jayme A.; Ramirez, Jose L.; Dimopoulos, George] Johns Hopkins Univ, Dept Mol Microbiol & Immunol, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA; [Souza-Neto, Jayme A.; Ramirez, Jose L.; Dimopoulos, George] Johns Hopkins Univ, Bloomberg Sch Publ Hlth, Malaria Res Inst, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA; [Hershey, Christine L.; Rodgers, Mary A.; Yang, Priscilla L.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Microbiol & Mol Genet, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Garcia-Blanco, Mariano A.] Duke NUS Grad Med Sch, Programin Emerging Infect Dis, Singapore 169547, Singapore","Pearson, JL (reprint author), Duke Univ, Med Ctr, Dept Mol Genet & Microbiol, Durham, NC 27710 USA.",pears016@mc.duke.edu; garci001@mc.duke.edu,"Souza-Neto, Jayme/E-7841-2010","Dimopoulos, George/0000-0001-6755-8111","National Institutes of Health (NIH) [RO1 GM067761, R21-AI64925, 5U54-AI057157-05S, 1RO1AI076442, 1R01AI061576-01, 1SA0RR024572-1]; American Society of Microbiology; Johns Hopkins Malaria Research Institute; North Carolina Biotechnology Center; Duke Center for RNA Biology; Duke University School of Medicine; Institute of Genome Sciences and Policy; Duke Comprehensive Cancer Center [5P30-CA14236]","We thank A. de Silva, C.

Here we show a new mechanism of directional signalling on the basis of the trafficking of Delta and Notch molecules already internalized in the SOP and subsequently targeted to the other daughter cell, pIIa. Internalized Delta and Notch traffic to an endosome marked by the protein Sara(4,5). During SOP mitosis, Sara endosomes containing Notch and Delta move to the central spindle and then to pIIa. Subsequently, in pIIa (but not in pIIb) Notch appears cleaved in Sara endosomes in a gamma-secretase-and Delta internalization-dependent manner, indicating that the release of the intracellular Notch tail to activate Notch target genes has occurred. We thus uncover a new mechanism to bias signalling even before asymmetric endocytosis of Sanpodo and Delta takes place in the daughter cells: already during SOP mitosis, asymmetric targeting of Delta and Notch-containing Sara endosomes will increase Notch signalling in pIIa and decrease it in pIIb.","[Coumailleau, F.; Fuerthauer, M.; Gonzalez-Gaitan, M.] Univ Geneva, Dept Biochem, CH-1211 Geneva 4, Switzerland; [Coumailleau, F.; Fuerthauer, M.; Gonzalez-Gaitan, M.] Univ Geneva, Dept Mol Biol, CH-1211 Geneva 4, Switzerland; [Knoblich, J.

Recent evidence indicated an important role for AMPK in the therapeutic benefits of metformin(2,3), thiazolidinediones(4) and exercise(5), which form the cornerstones of the clinical management of type 2 diabetes and associated metabolic disorders. In general, activation of AMPK acts to maintain cellular energy stores, switching on catabolic pathways that produce ATP, mostly by enhancing oxidative metabolism and mitochondrial biogenesis, while switching off anabolic pathways that consume ATP(1). This regulation can take place acutely, through the regulation of fast post-translational events, but also by transcriptionally reprogramming the cell to meet energetic needs. Here we demonstrate that AMPK controls the expression of genes involved in energy metabolism in mouse skeletal muscle by acting in coordination with another metabolic sensor, the NAD(+)-dependent type III deacetylase SIRT1. AMPK enhances SIRT1 activity by increasing cellular NAD(+) levels, resulting in the deacetylation and modulation of the activity of downstream SIRT1 targets that include the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactivator 1 alpha and the forkhead box O1 (FOXO1) and O3 (FOXO3a) transcription factors. The AMPK-induced SIRT1-mediated deacetylation of these targets explains many of the convergent biological effects of AMPK and SIRT1 on energy metabolism.","[Canto, Carles; Feige, Jerome N.; Lagouge, Marie; Noriega, Lilia; Auwerx, Johan] CNRS INSERM ULP, Inst Genet & Biol Mol & Cellulaire, F-67404 Illkirch Graffenstaden, France; [Canto, Carles; Noriega, Lilia; Auwerx, Johan] Ecole Polytech Fed Lausanne, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland; [Gerhart-Hines, Zachary; Puigserver, Pere] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dana Farber Canc Inst, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Gerhart-Hines, Zachary; Puigserver, Pere] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Cell Biol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Milne, Jill C.; Elliott, Peter J.] Sirtris Pharmaceut Inc, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Auwerx, Johan] Inst Clin Souris, F-67404 Illkirch Graffenstaden, France","Auwerx, J (reprint author), CNRS INSERM ULP, Inst Genet & Biol Mol & Cellulaire, F-67404 Illkirch Graffenstaden, France.",admin.auwerx@epfl.ch,,"Canto, Carles/0000-0002-5167-7922","CNRS; Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne; INSERM; ULP; NIH [DK59820, DK069966]; EU [LSHM-CT-2004-512013, ERC-2008-AdG-23118]; Fondation de la Recherche Medicale (FRM); EMBO; FEBS","This work was supported by grants of CNRS, Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne, INSERM, ULP, NIH (DK59820 and DK069966), EU FP6 (EUGENE2; LSHM-CT-2004-512013) and EU Ideas programme (sirtuins; ERC-2008-AdG-23118).

In mitosis sister chromatids are captured by microtubules emanating from both spindle poles, a process called bipolar attachment, whereas in meiosis I sisters are attached to microtubules originating from one spindle pole, called monopolar attachment. For determining chromosome orientation, kinetochore geometry or structure might be an important target of regulation. However, the molecular basis of this regulation has remained elusive. Here we show the link between kinetochore orientation and cohesion within the centromere in fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe by strategies developed to visualize the concealed cohesion within the centromere, and to introduce artificial tethers that can influence kinetochore geometry. Our data imply that cohesion at the core centromere induces the mono-orientation of kinetochores whereas cohesion at the peri-centromeric region promotes bi-orientation. Our study may reveal a general mechanism for the geometric regulation of kinetochores, which collaborates with previously defined tension-dependent reorientation machinery.","[Sakuno, Takeshi; Tada, Kenji; Watanabe, Yoshinori] Univ Tokyo, Inst Mol & Cellular Biosci, Lab Chromosome Dynam, Tokyo 1130032, Japan; [Tada, Kenji; Watanabe, Yoshinori] Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Sci, Grad Program Biophys & Biochem, Tokyo GRAD SCH SC, Japan","Watanabe, Y (reprint author), Univ Tokyo, Inst Mol & Cellular Biosci, Lab Chromosome Dynam, Tokyo 1130032, Japan.",ywatanab@iam.u-tokyo.ac.jp,,,"Special Coordination Funds for Promoting Science and Technology; MEXT, Japan; Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology of Japan","We thank S.

The ability to alter or inhibit protein interactions selectively would advance basic and applied molecular science. Assessing or modelling interaction specificity requires treating multiple competing complexes, which presents computational and experimental challenges. Here we present a computational framework for designing protein-interaction specificity and use it to identify specific peptide partners for human basic-region leucine zipper (bZIP) transcription factors. Protein microarrays were used to characterize designed, synthetic ligands for all but one of 20 bZIP families. The bZIP proteins share strong sequence and structural similarities and thus are challenging targets to bind specifically. Nevertheless, many of the designs, including examples that bind the oncoproteins c-Jun, c-Fos and c-Maf (also called JUN, FOS and MAF, respectively), were selective for their targets over all 19 other families. Collectively, the designs exhibit a wide range of interaction profiles and demonstrate that human bZIPs have only sparsely sampled the possible interaction space accessible to them. Our computational method provides a way to systematically analyse trade-offs between stability and specificity and is suitable for use with many types of structure-scoring functions; thus, it may prove broadly useful as a tool for protein design.","[Grigoryan, Gevorg; Reinke, Aaron W.; Keating, Amy E.] MIT, Dept Biol, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA","Keating, AE (reprint author), MIT, Dept Biol, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",keating@mit.edu,,,NIH [GM67681]; NSF [0216437],"This work was supported by the NIH award GM67681 and used computer equipment purchased under the NSF award 0216437.

A key missing piece in the supernova puzzle is the difficulty of identifying and studying progenitor stars. In only a single case-that of supernova SN 1987A in the Large Magellanic Cloud-has a star been detected at the supernova location before the explosion, and been subsequently shown to have vanished after the supernova event(1). The progenitor of SN 1987A was a blue supergiant, which required a rethink of stellar evolution models(2). The progenitor of supernova SN 2005gl was proposed to be an extremely luminous object(3), but the association was not robustly established (it was not even clear that the putative progenitor was a single luminous star). Here we report that the previously proposed(3) object was indeed the progenitor star of SN 2005gl.

Electron spin resonance driven by high-frequency magnetic fields has enhanced our understanding of quantum mechanics, and finds application in fields as diverse as medicine and quantum information(2). Spin resonance can also be induced by high-frequency electric fields in materials with a spin orbit interaction; the oscillation of the electrons creates a momentum-dependent effective magnetic field acting on the electron spin(3-9). Here we report electron spin resonance due to a spin orbit interaction that does not require external driving fields. The effect, which we term ballistic spin resonance, is driven by the free motion of electrons that bounce at frequencies of tens of gigahertz in micrometre-scale channels of a two-dimensional electron gas. This is a frequency range that is experimentally challenging to access in spin resonance, and especially difficult on a chip. The resonance is manifest in electrical measurements of pure spin currents(10)-we see a strong suppression of spin relaxation length when the oscillating spin-orbit field is in resonance with spin precession in a static magnetic field. These findings illustrate how the spin-orbit interaction can be harnessed for spin manipulation in a spintronic circuit(11), and point the way to gate-tunable coherent spin rotations in ballistic nanostructures without external alternating current fields.","[Frolov, S.

Thin, elongated strips of graphene that possess straight edges, termed graphene ribbons, gradually transform from semiconductors to semimetals as their width increases(4-7), and represent a particularly versatile variety of graphene. Several lithographic(7,8), chemical(9-11) and synthetic(12) procedures are known to produce microscopic samples of graphene nanoribbons, and one chemical vapour deposition process(13) has successfully produced macroscopic quantities of nanoribbons at 950 degrees C. Here we describe a simple solution-based oxidative process for producing a nearly 100% yield of nanoribbon structures by lengthwise cutting and unravelling of multiwalled carbon nanotube (MWCNT) side walls. Although oxidative shortening of MWCNTs has previously been achieved(14), lengthwise cutting is hitherto unreported. Ribbon structures with high water solubility are obtained. Subsequent chemical reduction of the nanoribbons from MWCNTs results in restoration of electrical conductivity. These early results affording nanoribbons could eventually lead to applications in fields of electronics and composite materials where bulk quantities of nanoribbons are required(15-17).","[Kosynkin, Dmitry V.; Higginbotham, Amanda L.; Sinitskii, Alexander; Lomeda, Jay R.; Dimiev, Ayrat; Price, B.

The all-semiconducting nature of sub-10-nm GNRs could bypass the problem of the extreme chirality dependence of the metal or semiconductor nature of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) in future electronics(1,2). Currently, making GNRs using lithographic(3,4,6), chemical(7-9) or sonochemical(1) methods is challenging. It is difficult to obtain GNRs with smooth edges and controllable widths at high yields. Here we show an approach to making GNRs by unzipping multi-walled carbon nanotubes by plasma etching of nanotubes partly embedded in a polymer film. The GNRs have smooth edges and a narrow width distribution (10-20 nm). Raman spectroscopy and electrical transport measurements reveal the high quality of the GNRs. Unzipping CNTs with well-defined structures in an array will allow the production of GNRs with controlled widths, edge structures, placement and alignment in a scalable fashion for device integration.","[Jiao, Liying; Zhang, Li; Wang, Xinran; Diankov, Georgi; Dai, Hongjie] Stanford Univ, Dept Chem, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Jiao, Liying; Zhang, Li; Wang, Xinran; Diankov, Georgi; Dai, Hongjie] Stanford Univ, Adv Mat Lab, Stanford, CA 94305 USA","Dai, HJ (reprint author), Stanford Univ, Dept Chem, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",hdai@stanford.edu,"Wang, Xinran/E-8392-2010; Jiao, Liying/C-6307-2011","Wang, Xinran/0000-0002-3975-1667","Microelectronics Advanced Research Corporation - Materials, Structures, and Devices Center; Intel; US Office of Naval Research","This work was supported by Microelectronics Advanced Research Corporation - Materials, Structures, and Devices Center, Intel and the US Office of Naval Research.",,29,1447,1483,62,959,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,16-Apr,2009,458,7240,,,,,877,880,,10.1038/nature07919,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,433CS,WOS:000265182500040,19370031,No,Y,N,11/20/17

The rate of this projected rise is based on ice-sheet melting simulations and downplays discoveries of more rapid ice loss(2,3). Knowing the rate at which sea level reached its highstand during the last interglacial period is fundamental in assessing if such rapid ice-loss processes could lead to future catastrophic sea-level rise. The best direct record of sea level during this highstand comes from well-dated fossil reefs in stable areas(4-6). However, this record lacks both reef-crest development up to the full highstand elevation, as inferred(7) from widespread intertidal indicators at +6m, and a detailed chronology, owing to the difficulty of replicating U-series ages on submillennial timescales(8). Here we present a complete reef-crest sequence for the last interglacial highstand and its U-series chronology from the stable northeast Yucatan peninsula, Mexico. We find that reef development during the highstand was punctuated by reef-crest demise at +3m and back-stepping to +6m. The abrupt demise of the lower-reef crest, but continuous accretion between the lower-lagoonal unit and the upper-reef crest, allows us to infer that this back-stepping occurred on an ecological timescale and was triggered by a 2-3-m jump in sea level. Using strictly reliable Th-230 ages of corals from the upper-reef crest, and improved stratigraphic screening of coral ages from other stable sites, we constrain this jump to have occurred similar to 121 kyr ago and conclude that it supports an episode of ice-sheet instability during the terminal phase of the last interglacial period.","[Blanchon, Paul] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Inst Marine & Limnol Sci, Cancun, Quintana Roo, Mexico; [Eisenhauer, Anton; Fietzke, Jan; Liebetrau, Volker] IFM GEOMAR, Leibniz Inst Marine Sci, D-24148 Kiel, Germany","Blanchon, P (reprint author), Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Inst Marine & Limnol Sci, AP1152, Cancun, Quintana Roo, Mexico.",blanchon@icmyl.unam.mx,"Blanchon, Paul/B-7720-2009; Eisenhauer, Anton/K-6454-2012","Blanchon, Paul/0000-0002-7792-5808; Fietzke, Jan/0000-0002-5530-7208",DGAPA [IN218799],"We thank M.

The common denominator of all dopamine neurons is the expression of dopamine pathway genes, which code for a set of phylogenetically conserved proteins involved in dopamine synthesis and transport. Gene regulatory mechanisms that result in the direct activation of dopamine pathway genes and thereby ultimately determine the identity of dopamine neurons are poorly understood in all systems studied so far(2). Here we show that a simple cis-regulatory element, the dopamine (DA) motif, controls the expression of all dopamine pathway genes in all dopaminergic cell types in Caenorhabditis elegans. The DA motif is activated by the ETS transcription factor AST-1. Loss of ast-1 results in the failure of all distinct dopaminergic neuronal subtypes to terminally differentiate. Ectopic expression of ast-1 is sufficient to activate the dopamine pathway in some cellular contexts. Vertebrate dopamine pathway genes also contain phylogenetically conserved DA motifs that can be activated by the mouse ETS transcription factor Etv1 (also known as ER81), and a specific class of dopamine neurons fails to differentiate in mice lacking Etv1. Moreover, ectopic Etv1 expression induces dopaminergic fate marker expression in neuronal primary cultures. Mouse Etv1 can also functionally substitute for ast-1 in C. elegans. Our studies reveal a simple and apparently conserved regulatory logic of dopamine neuron terminal differentiation and may provide new entry points into the diagnosis or therapy of conditions in which dopamine neurons are defective.","[Flames, Nuria; Hobert, Oliver] Columbia Univ, Dept Biochem & Mol Biophys, Med Ctr, Howard Hughes Med Inst, New York, NY 10032 USA","Flames, N (reprint author), Columbia Univ, Dept Biochem & Mol Biophys, Med Ctr, Howard Hughes Med Inst, 630 W 168th St, New York, NY 10032 USA.",nf2171@columbia.edu; or38@columbia.edu,"Phelps, Steve/H-2263-2011; Flames, Nuria/L-2290-2017","Flames, Nuria/0000-0003-0961-0609; Hobert, Oliver/0000-0002-7634-2854","National Institutes of Health [R01NS039996-05, R01NS050266-03]; Howard Hughes Medical Institute; EMBO; Marie Curie Outgoing International fellowship","We thank Q.

In health, activation of complement is precisely controlled through membrane-bound and soluble plasma-regulatory proteins including complement factor H (fH; ref.2), a 155 kDa protein composed of 20 domains (termed complement control protein repeats). Many pathogens have evolved the ability to avoid immune-killing by recruiting host complement regulators(3) and several pathogens have adapted to avoid complement-mediated killing by sequestering fH to their surface(4). Here we present the structure of a complement regulator in complex with its pathogen surface-protein ligand. This reveals how the important human pathogen Neisseria meningitidis subverts immune responses by mimicking the host, using protein instead of charged-carbohydrate chemistry to recruit the host complement regulator, fH. The structure also indicates the molecular basis of the host-specificity of the interaction between fH and the meningococcus, and informs attempts to develop novel therapeutics and vaccines.","[Prosser, Beverly E.; Caesar, Joseph J.

Common variants in the first intron define a risk allele predisposing to obesity, with homozygotes for the risk allele weighing approximately 3 kilograms more than homozygotes for the low risk allele(1). Nevertheless, the functional role of FTO in energy homeostasis remains elusive. Here we show that the loss of Fto in mice leads to postnatal growth retardation and a significant reduction in adipose tissue and lean body mass. The leanness of Fto-deficient mice develops as a consequence of increased energy expenditure and systemic sympathetic activation, despite decreased spontaneous locomotor activity and relative hyperphagia. Taken together, these experiments provide, to our knowledge, the first direct demonstration that Fto is functionally involved in energy homeostasis by the control of energy expenditure.","[Fischer, Julia; Emmerling, Christian; Vierkotten, Jeanette; Peters, Thomas; Ruether, Ulrich] Univ Dusseldorf, Inst Anim Dev & Mol Biol, D-40225 Dusseldorf, Germany; [Koch, Linda; Bruening, Jens C.] Univ Cologne, Dept Mouse Genet & Metab, Inst Genet, D-50674 Cologne, Germany; [Koch, Linda; Bruening, Jens C.] Univ Cologne, Dept Internal Med 2, D-50674 Cologne, Germany; [Koch, Linda; Bruening, Jens C.] Univ Cologne, CMMC, D-50674 Cologne, Germany; [Koch, Linda; Bruening, Jens C.] Univ Cologne, Cologne Excellence Cluster Cellular Stress Respon, D-50674 Cologne, Germany; [Koch, Linda; Bruening, Jens C.] Max Planck Inst Biol Ageing, D-50674 Cologne, Germany","Ruther, U (reprint author), Univ Dusseldorf, Inst Anim Dev & Mol Biol, Univ Str 1, D-40225 Dusseldorf, Germany.",jens.bruening@uni-koeln.de; ruether@uni-duesseldorf.de,,"Koch, Linda/0000-0002-2943-1993",Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft; NGFNplus,"The authors thank S.

In addition, antigens present in necrotic cells can sometimes provoke a specific immune response(2-4) and it has been argued that necrosis could explain adaptive immunity in seemingly infection-free situations, such as after allograft transplantation or in spontaneous and therapy-induced tumour rejection(5,6). In the mouse, the CD8 alpha(+) subset of dendritic cells phagocytoses dead cell remnants and cross-primes CD8(+) T cells against cell-associated antigens(7). Here we show that CD8 alpha(+) dendritic cells use CLEC9A (also known as DNGR-1), a recently-characterized C-type lectin(8-10), to recognize a preformed signal that is exposed on necrotic cells. Loss or blockade of CLEC9A does not impair the uptake of necrotic cell material by CD8 alpha(+) dendritic cells, but specifically reduces cross-presentation of dead-cell-associated antigens in vitro and decreases the immunogenicity of necrotic cells in vivo. The function of CLEC9A requires a key tyrosine residue in its intracellular tail that allows the recruitment and activation of the tyrosine kinase SYK, which is also essential for cross-presentation of dead-cell-associated antigens. Thus, CLEC9A functions as a SYK-coupled C-type lectin receptor to mediate sensing of necrosis by the principal dendritic-cell subset involved in regulating cross-priming to cell-associated antigens.","[Sancho, David; Joffre, Olivier P.; Keller, Anna M.; Rogers, Neil C.; Hernanz-Falcon, Patricia; Reis e Sousa, Caetano] Lincolns Inn Fields Labs, Immunobiol Lab, London WC2A 3PX, England; [Sancho, David; Joffre, Olivier P.; Keller, Anna M.; Rogers, Neil C.; Hernanz-Falcon, Patricia; Reis e Sousa, Caetano] Lincolns Inn Fields Labs, London Res Inst, Canc Res UK, FACS Lab, London WC2A 3PX, England; [Martinez, Dolores; Rosewell, Ian] Imperial Canc Res Fund, Clare Hall Labs, Canc Res UK, Trangen Serv, Potters Bar EN6 3LD, Herts, England","Sousa, CRE (reprint author), Lincolns Inn Fields Labs, Immunobiol Lab, 44 Lincolns Inn Fields, London WC2A 3PX, England.",caetano@cancer.org.uk,"Sancho, David/D-3433-2009; Joffre, Olivier/K-1235-2014","Sancho, David/0000-0003-2890-3984; Reis e Sousa, Caetano/0000-0001-7392-2119; JOFFRE, Olivier/0000-0003-1168-8165",Cancer Research UK; EMBO [ALTF 336-2004]; European Community [MEIF-CT-2005-009205],"This work was funded by Cancer Research UK.

After injury these cells are induced to proliferate to quickly reestablish homeostasis(1). The signalling molecules promoting the exit of HSCs out of the dormant stage remain largely unknown. Here we show that in response to treatment of mice with interferon-alpha (IFN alpha), HSCs efficiently exit G(0) and enter an active cell cycle. HSCs respond to IFN alpha treatment by the increased phosphorylation of STAT1 and PKB/Akt (also known as AKT1), the expression of IFN alpha target genes, and the upregulation of stem cell antigen-1 (Sca-1, also known as LY6A). HSCs lacking the IFN alpha/beta receptor (IFNAR)(2), STAT1 (ref. 3) or Sca-1 (ref. 4) are insensitive to IFN alpha stimulation, demonstrating that STAT1 and Sca-1 mediate IFN alpha-induced HSC proliferation. Although dormant HSCs are resistant to the anti-proliferative chemotherapeutic agent 5-fluoro-uracil(1,5), HSCs pre-treated (primed) with IFN alpha and thus induced to proliferate are efficiently eliminated by 5-fluoro-uracil exposure in vivo. Conversely, HSCs chronically activated by IFN alpha are functionally compromised and are rapidly out-competed by non-activatable Ifnar(-/-) cells in competitive repopulation assays. Whereas chronic activation of the IFN alpha pathway in HSCs impairs their function, acute IFN alpha treatment promotes the proliferation of dormant HSCs in vivo. These data may help to clarify the so far unexplained clinical effects of IFN alpha on leukaemic cells(6,7), and raise the possibility for new applications of type I interferons to target cancer stem cells(8).","[Essers, Marieke A.

PB1 holds the polymerase active site(1) and reportedly harbours endonuclease activity(2), whereas PB2 is responsible for cap binding(2-4). The PA amino terminus is understood to be the major functional part of the PA protein and has been implicated in several roles, including endonuclease(5) and protease activities(6) as well as viral RNA/complementary RNA promoter binding(7). Here we report the 2.2 angstrom (angstrom) crystal structure of the N-terminal 197 residues of PA, termed PA(N), from an avian influenza H5N1 virus. The PA(N) structure has an alpha/beta architecture and reveals a bound magnesium ion coordinated by a motif similar to the (P) DXN(D/E) XK motif characteristic of many endonucleases. Structural comparisons and mutagenesis analysis of the motif identified in PA(N) provide further evidence that PA(N) holds an endonuclease active site. Furthermore, functional analysis with in vivo ribonucleoprotein reconstitution and direct in vitro endonuclease assays strongly suggest that PA(N) holds the endonuclease active site and has critical roles in endonuclease activity of the influenza virus polymerase, rather than PB1. The high conservation of this endonuclease active site among influenza strains indicates that PA(N) is an important target for the design of new anti-influenza therapeutics.","[Yuan, Puwei; Chen, Shoudeng; Zhou, Jie; He, Xiaojing; Lv, Zongyang; Li, Xuemei; Rao, Zihe; Liu, Yingfang] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Biophys, Natl Lab Biomacromol, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Bartlam, Mark; Deng, Tao; Rao, Zihe] Nankai Univ, Coll Life Sci, Tianjin 300071, Peoples R China; [Bartlam, Mark; Deng, Tao; Rao, Zihe] Nankai Univ, Tianjin Key Lab Prot Sci, Tianjin 300071, Peoples R China; [Lou, Zhiyong; Li, Xuemei; Rao, Zihe] Tsinghua Univ, Struct Biol Lab, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China; [Ge, Ruowen] Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Biol Sci, Singapore 117543, Singapore; [Deng, Tao; Fodor, Ervin] Univ Oxford, Sir William Dunn Sch Pathol, Oxford OX1 3RE, England","Rao, ZH (reprint author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Biophys, Natl Lab Biomacromol, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China.",raozh@xtal.tsinghua.edu.cn; liuy@ibp.ac.cn,"chen, shoudeng/G-3556-2012; Ge, Ruowen/D-8352-2012; HE, XIAOJING/A-6040-2013","Ge, Ruowen/0000-0002-0750-7336; Lv, Zongyang/0000-0002-8862-113X; Bartlam, Mark/0000-0001-5173-5080","National Natural Science Foundation of China [30599432, 30221003, 30721003]; Ministry of Science and Technology International Cooperation [2006DFB32420]; Ministry of Science and Technology 863 Project [2006AA02A314, 2006AA02A322]; Ministry of Science and Technology 973 Project [2006CB504300, 2007CB914300]; Medical Research Council [G0700848]","We thank H.

The polymerase synthesizes viral messenger RNAs using short capped primers derived from cellular transcripts by a unique 'cap-snatching' mechanism(1). The PB2 subunit binds the 59 cap of host pre-mRNAs(2-4), which are subsequently cleaved after 10-13 nucleotides by the viral endonuclease, hitherto thought to reside in the PB2 (ref. 5) or PB1 (ref. 2) subunits. Here we describe biochemical and structural studies showing that the amino-terminal 209 residues of the PA subunit contain the endonuclease active site. We show that this domain has intrinsic RNA and DNA endonuclease activity that is strongly activated by manganese ions, matching observations reported for the endonuclease activity of the intact trimeric polymerase(6,7). Furthermore, this activity is inhibited by 2,4-dioxo-4-phenylbutanoic acid, a known inhibitor of the influenza endonuclease(8). The crystal structure of the domain reveals a structural core closely resembling resolvases and type II restriction endonucleases. The active site comprises a histidine and a cluster of three acidic residues, conserved in all influenza viruses, which bind two manganese ions in a configuration similar to other two-metal-dependent endonucleases. Two active site residues have previously been shown to specifically eliminate the polymerase endonuclease activity when mutated(9). These results will facilitate the optimisation of endonuclease inhibitors(10-12) as potential new anti-influenza drugs.","[Dias, Alexandre; Bouvier, Denis; Crepin, Thibaut; McCarthy, Andrew A.; Hart, Darren J.; Baudin, Florence; Cusack, Stephen; Ruigrok, Rob W.

All known thymidylate synthases rely on an active site residue of the enzyme to activate 2'-deoxyuridine-5'-monophosphate(1,2). This functionality has been demonstrated for classical thymidylate synthases, including human thymidylate synthase, and is instrumental in mechanism-based inhibition of these enzymes. Here we report an example of thymidylate biosynthesis that occurs without an enzymatic nucleophile. This unusual biosynthetic pathway occurs in organisms containing the thyX gene, which codes for a flavin-dependent thymidylate synthase (FDTS), and is present in several human pathogens(3-5). Our findings indicate that the putative active site nucleophile is not required for FDTS catalysis, and no alternative nucleophilic residues capable of serving this function can be identified. Instead, our findings suggest that a hydride equivalent (that is, a proton and two electrons) is transferred from the reduced flavin cofactor directly to the uracil ring, followed by an isomerization of the intermediate to form the product, 2'-deoxythymidine-5'-monophosphate. These observations indicate a very different chemical cascade than that of classical thymidylate synthases or any other known biological methylation. The findings and chemical mechanism proposed here, together with available structural data, suggest that selective inhibition of FDTSs, with little effect on human thymine biosynthesis, should be feasible. Because several human pathogens depend on FDTS for DNA biosynthesis, its unique mechanism makes it an attractive target for antibiotic drugs.","[Koehn, Eric M.; Fleischmann, Todd; Kohen, Amnon] Univ Iowa, Dept Chem, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA; [Conrad, John A.; Palfey, Bruce A.] Univ Michigan, Sch Med, Dept Biol Chem, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Lesley, Scott A.] Novartis Res Fdn, Genom Inst, Joint Ctr Struct Genom, San Diego, CA 92121 USA; [Mathews, Irimpan I.] Stanford Univ, Stanford Synchrotron Radiat Lab, Menlo Pk, CA 94025 USA","Kohen, A (reprint author), Univ Iowa, Dept Chem, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA.",amnon-kohen@uiowa.edu,,"Palfey, Bruce/0000-0001-5098-259X","NIH [R01 GM065368, R01 GM61087, GM08270]; NSF [CHE 0715448]; JCSG [U54GM074898]; DOE; OBER; NCRR; NIGMS","This work was supported by NIH R01 GM065368 and NSF CHE 0715448 to A.

Here we show that certain human cancer cell lines, when grown as tumour xenografts in mice, are highly sensitive to the anti-growth effects of dietary restriction, whereas others are resistant. Cancer cells that form dietary-restriction-resistant tumours carry mutations that cause constitutive activation of the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K) pathway and in culture proliferate in the absence of insulin or insulin-like growth factor 1. Substitution of an activated mutant allele of PI3K with wild-type PI3K in otherwise isogenic cancer cells, or the restoration of PTEN expression in a PTEN-null cancer cell line, is sufficient to convert a dietary-restriction-resistant tumour into one that is dietary-restriction-sensitive. Dietary restriction does not affect a PTEN-null mouse model of prostate cancer, but it significantly decreases tumour burden in a mouse model of lung cancer lacking constitutive PI3K signalling. Thus, the PI3K pathway is an important determinant of the sensitivity of tumours to dietary restriction, and activating mutations in the pathway may influence the response of cancers to dietary restriction-mimetic therapies.","[Kalaany, Nada Y.; Sabatini, David M.] Whitehead Inst Biomed Res, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; [Kalaany, Nada Y.; Sabatini, David M.] MIT, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Dept Biol, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Kalaany, Nada Y.; Sabatini, David M.] MIT, Koch Inst Integrat Canc Res, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Sabatini, David M.] Broad Inst, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA","Sabatini, DM (reprint author), Whitehead Inst Biomed Res, 9 Cambridge Ctr, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA.",sabatini@wi.mit.edu,,/0000-0002-1446-7256,"Alexander and Margaret Stewart Trust Award; David H.

Here we describe MLN4924, a potent and selective inhibitor of NAE. MLN4924 disrupts cullin-RING ligase-mediated protein turnover leading to apoptotic death in human tumour cells by a new mechanism of action, the deregulation of S-phase DNA synthesis.

In the redshift range 1 <= z <= 4, these massive submillimetre galaxies go through a phase characterized by optically obscured star formation at rates several hundred times that in the local Universe. Half of the starlight from this highly energetic process is absorbed and thermally re-radiated by clouds of dust at temperatures near 30 K with spectral energy distributions peaking at 100 mu m in the rest frame(9). At 1 <= z <= 4, the peak is redshifted to wavelengths between 200 and 500 mu m. The cumulative effect of these galaxies is to yield extragalactic optical and far-infrared backgrounds with approximately equal energy densities. Since the initial detection of the far-infrared background (FIRB)(10), higher-resolution experiments have sought to decompose this integrated radiation into the contributions from individual galaxies. Here we report the results of an extragalactic survey at 250, 350 and 500 mu m. Combining our results at 500 mu m with those at 24 mu m, we determine that all of the FIRB comes from individual galaxies, with galaxies at z >= 1.2 accounting for 70% of it. As expected, at the longest wavelengths the signal is dominated by ultraluminous galaxies at z > 1.","[Devlin, Mark J.; Klein, Jeff; Rex, Marie; Semisch, Christopher; Truch, Matthew D.

This universality is mainly independent of the microscopic details, depending only on the symmetry and dimension of the system. Exploring how universality is affected by the system dimensions is an important unresolved problem. Here we demonstrate experimentally that universality persists even at a dimensionality crossover in ferromagnetic nanowires. As the wire width decreases, the magnetic domain wall dynamics changes from elastic creep(6-9) in two dimensions to a particle-like stochastic behaviour(10) in one dimension. Applying finite-size scaling, we find that all our experimental data in one and two dimensions (including the crossover regime) collapse onto a single curve, signalling universality at the criticality transition. The crossover to the one-dimensional regime occurs at a few hundred nanometres, corresponding to the integration scale for modern nanodevices.","[Kim, Kab-Jin; Lee, Jae-Chul; Ahn, Sung-Min; Lee, Kang-Soo; Choe, Sug-Bong] Seoul Natl Univ, Ctr Subwavelength Opt, Seoul 151742, South Korea; [Kim, Kab-Jin; Lee, Jae-Chul; Ahn, Sung-Min; Lee, Kang-Soo; Choe, Sug-Bong] Seoul Natl Univ, Sch Phys & Astron, Seoul 151742, South Korea; [Lee, Jae-Chul; Shin, Kyung-Ho] Korea Adv Inst Sci & Technol, Ctr Spintron Res, Seoul 136791, South Korea; [Lee, Chang-Won; Cho, Young Jin; Seo, Sunae] Samsung Adv Inst Technol, Yongin 449712, South Korea; [Lee, Hyun-Woo] Pohang Univ Sci & Technol, PCTP, Pohang 790784, Kyungbuk, South Korea; [Lee, Hyun-Woo] Pohang Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Phys, Pohang 790784, Kyungbuk, South Korea","Choe, SB (reprint author), Seoul Natl Univ, Ctr Subwavelength Opt, Seoul 151742, South Korea.",sugbong@snu.ac.kr; hwl@postech.ac.kr,"Lee, Hyun-Woo/B-8995-2008; Lee, Chang-Won/C-2709-2009; Kim, Kab-Jin/Q-2017-2016","Lee, Hyun-Woo/0000-0002-1648-8093; Lee, Chang-Won/0000-0003-0546-0439; ","KOSEF [R0A-2007-000-20032-0, R01-2007-000-20281-0, R11-2000-071, R11-2008-095-01000-0]; Seoul Science Fellowship; KIST; MEST","This study was supported by KOSEF through the NRL programme (R0A-2007-000-20032-0).

The large, positive Nernst signal observed in hole-doped high-T-c superconductors(2) above their transition temperature (T-c) has so far been attributed to fluctuating superconductivity(3). Here we report that in some of these materials the large Nernst signal is in fact the result of stripe order, a form of spin/charge modulation(4) that causes a reconstruction of the Fermi surface(5). In La2-xSrxCuO4 (LSCO) doped with Nd or Eu, the onset of stripe order causes the Nernst signal to change from being small and negative to being large and positive, as revealed either by lowering the hole concentration across the quantum critical point in Nd-doped LSCO (refs 6-8) or by lowering the temperature across the ordering temperature in Eu-doped LSCO (refs 9, 10).

Hopcalite catalysts (mixtures of manganese and copper oxides) were originally developed for purifying air in submarines, but they are not especially active at ambient temperatures and are also deactivated by the presence of moisture(3,4). Noble metal catalysts, on the other hand, are water tolerant but usually require temperatures above 100 degrees C for efficient operation(5,6). Gold exhibits high activity at low temperatures and superior stability under moisture, but only when deposited in nanoparticulate form on base transition-metal oxides(7-9). The development of active and stable catalysts without noble metals for low-temperature CO oxidation under an ambient atmosphere remains a significant challenge. Here we report that tricobalt tetraoxide nanorods not only catalyse CO oxidation at temperatures as low as -77 degrees C but also remain stable in a moist stream of normal feed gas. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy demonstrates that the Co3O4 nanorods predominantly expose their {110} planes, favouring the presence of active Co3+ species at the surface. Kinetic analyses reveal that the turnover frequency associated with individual Co3+ sites on the nanorods is similar to that of the conventional nanoparticles of this material, indicating that the significantly higher reaction rate that we have obtained with a nanorod morphology is probably due to the surface richness of active Co3+ sites. These results show the importance of morphology control in the preparation of base transition-metal oxides as highly efficient oxidation catalysts.","[Xie, Xiaowei; Li, Yong; Shen, Wenjie] Chinese Acad Sci, Dalian Inst Chem Phys, State Key Lab Catalysis, Dalian 116023, Peoples R China; [Liu, Zhi-Quan] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Met Res, Shenyang Natl Lab Mat Sci, Shenyang 110016, Peoples R China; [Haruta, Masatake] Tokyo Metropolitan Univ, Grad Sch Urban Environm Sci, Dept Appl Chem, Tokyo 1920397, Japan; [Haruta, Masatake] Japan Sci & Technol Agcy, CREST, Kawaguchi, Saitama 3320012, Japan","Shen, WJ (reprint author), Chinese Acad Sci, Dalian Inst Chem Phys, State Key Lab Catalysis, Dalian 116023, Peoples R China.",shen98@dicp.ac.cn,"haruta, masatake/J-6561-2012; Liu, Zhi-Quan/G-4635-2017","Liu, Zhi-Quan/0000-0001-7097-8977; Xie, Xiaowei/0000-0001-6134-5748",National Natural Science Foundation of China; National Basic Research Program of China,"We thank C.

Oxidative weathering of terrestrial sulphides, increased oceanic sulphate, and the ecological success of sulphate-reducing microorganisms over methanogens has been proposed as a possible cause for the methane collapse(1), but this explanation is difficult to reconcile with the rock record(2,3). Banded iron formations preserve a history of Precambrian oceanic elemental abundance and can provide insights into our understanding of early microbial life and its influence on the evolution of the Earth system(4,5). Here we report a decline in the molar nickel to iron ratio recorded in banded iron formations about 2.7 Gyr ago, which we attribute to a reduced flux of nickel to the oceans, a consequence of cooling upper-mantle temperatures and decreased eruption of nickel-rich ultramafic rocks at the time. We measured nickel partition coefficients between simulated Precambrian sea water and diverse iron hydroxides, and subsequently determined that dissolved nickel concentrations may have reached similar to 400nM throughout much of the Archaean eon, but dropped below similar to 200nM by 2.5 Gyr ago and to modern day values(6) (similar to 9 nM) by similar to 550 Myr ago. Nickel is a key metal cofactor in several enzymes of methanogens(7) and we propose that its decline would have stifled their activity in the ancient oceans and disrupted the supply of biogenic methane. A decline in biogenic methane production therefore could have occurred before increasing environmental oxygenation and not necessarily be related to it. The enzymatic reliance of methanogens on a diminishing supply of volcanic nickel links mantle evolution to the redox state of the atmosphere.","[Konhauser, Kurt O.; Pecoits, Ernesto; Lalonde, Stefan V.] Univ Alberta, Dept Earth & Atmospher Sci, Edmonton, AB T6G 2E3, Canada; [Papineau, Dominic] Carnegie Inst Sci, Geophys Lab, Washington, DC 20015 USA; [Nisbet, Euan G.] Royal Holloway Univ London, Dept Earth Sci, Egham TW20 0EX, Surrey, England; [Barley, Mark E.] Univ Western Australia, Sch Earth & Environm, Crawley, WA 6009, Australia; [Arndt, Nicholas T.] Univ Grenoble 1, Lab Geodynam Chaine Alpines Maison Geosci, F-38041 Grenoble, France; [Zahnle, Kevin] NASA, Ames Res Ctr, Moffett Field, CA 94035 USA; [Kamber, Balz S.] Laurentian Univ, Dept Earth Sci, Sudbury, ON P3E 2C6, Canada","Konhauser, KO (reprint author), Univ Alberta, Dept Earth & Atmospher Sci, Edmonton, AB T6G 2E3, Canada.",kurtk@ualberta.ca,"Kamber, Balz/A-1823-2008; Lalonde, Stefan/I-8879-2014","Kamber, Balz/0000-0002-8720-0608; Lalonde, Stefan/0000-0003-1318-2280; Konhauser, Kurt/0000-0001-7722-7068; Papineau, Dominic/0000-0003-0063-7514",Natural Science and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC); Australian Research Council (ARC),"We thank M.

The tendency for species to retain their ancestral ecology has been demonstrated in distributions on local and regional scales(5-7), but the extent of ecological conservatism over tens of millions of years and across continents has not been assessed(8-13). Here we show that biome stasis at speciation has outweighed biome shifts by a ratio of more than 25:1, by inferring ancestral biomes for an ecologically diverse sample of more than 11,000 plant species from around the Southern Hemisphere. Stasis was also prevalent in transocean colonizations. Availability of a suitable biome could have substantially influenced which lineages establish on more than one landmass, in addition to the influence of the rarity of the dispersal events themselves. Conversely, the taxonomic composition of biomes has probably been strongly influenced by the rarity of species' transitions between biomes. This study has implications for the future because if clades have inherently limited capacity to shift biomes(13), then their evolutionary potential could be strongly compromised by biome contraction as climate changes.","[Crisp, Michael D.] Australian Natl Univ, Sch Bot & Zool, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia; [Arroyo, Mary T.

The H3K9-specific demethylase Jhdm2a (also known as Jmjd1a and Kdm3a) has an important role in nuclear hormone receptor-mediated gene activation and male germ cell development(3,4). Through disruption of the Jhdm2a gene in mice, here we demonstrate that Jhdm2a is critically important in regulating the expression of metabolic genes. The loss of Jhdm2a function results in obesity and hyperlipidemia in mice. We provide evidence that the loss of Jhdm2a function disrupts beta-adrenergic-stimulated glycerol release and oxygen consumption in brown fat, and decreases fat oxidation and glycerol release in skeletal muscles. We show that Jhdm2a expression is induced by beta-adrenergic stimulation, and that Jhdm2a directly regulates peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (Ppara) and Ucp1 expression. Furthermore, we demonstrate that beta-adrenergic activation-induced binding of Jhdm2a to the PPAR responsive element (PPRE) of the Ucp1 gene not only decreases levels of H3K9me2 (dimethylation of lysine 9 of histone H3) at the PPRE, but also facilitates the recruitment of Ppar gamma and Rxr alpha and their co-activators Pgc1 alpha (also known as Ppargc1a), CBP/p300 (Crebbp) and Src1 (Ncoa1) to the PPRE. Our studies thus demonstrate an essential role for Jhdm2a in regulating metabolic gene expression and normal weight control in mice.","[Tateishi, Keisuke; Okada, Yuki; Kallin, Eric M.; Zhang, Yi] Univ N Carolina, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA; [Tateishi, Keisuke; Okada, Yuki; Kallin, Eric M.; Zhang, Yi] Univ N Carolina, Lineberger Comprehens Canc Ctr, Dept Biochem & Biophys, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA","Zhang, Y (reprint author), Univ N Carolina, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA.",yi_zhang@med.unc.edu,,,UNC Clinical Nutrition Research Unit [DK56350],"We thank B.

Notwithstanding the renewed interest in the Warburg effect, cancer cells also depend on continued mitochondrial function for metabolism, specifically glutaminolysis that catabolizes glutamine to generate ATP and lactate(3). Glutamine, which is highly transported into proliferating cells(4,5), is a major source of energy and nitrogen for biosynthesis, and a carbon substrate for anabolic processes in cancer cells, but the regulation of glutamine metabolism is not well understood(1,6). Here we report that the c-Myc (hereafter referred to as Myc) oncogenic transcription factor, which is known to regulate microRNAs(7,8) and stimulate cell proliferation(9), transcriptionally represses miR-23a and miR-23b, resulting in greater expression of their target protein, mitochondrial glutaminase, in human P-493 B lymphoma cells and PC3 prostate cancer cells. This leads to upregulation of glutamine catabolism(10). Glutaminase converts glutamine to glutamate, which is further catabolized through the tricarboxylic acid cycle for the production of ATP or serves as substrate for glutathione synthesis(11). The unique means by which Myc regulates glutaminase uncovers a previously unsuspected link between Myc regulation of miRNAs, glutamine metabolism, and energy and reactive oxygen species homeostasis.","[Gao, Ping; Zeller, Karen I.; Dang, Chi V.] Johns Hopkins Univ, Sch Med, Dept Med, Div Hematol, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA; [Tchernyshyov, Irina; Van Eyk, Jennifer E.] Johns Hopkins Univ, Sch Med, Div Cardiol, Dept Med, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA; [Chang, Tsung-Cheng; Lee, Yun-Sil; Mendell, Joshua T.; Dang, Chi V.] Johns Hopkins Univ, Sch Med, McKusick Nathans Inst Genet Med, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA; [Mendell, Joshua T.] Johns Hopkins Univ, Sch Med, Dept Pediat, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA; [Mendell, Joshua T.; Dang, Chi V.] Johns Hopkins Univ, Sch Med, Dept Mol Biol & Genet, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA; [De Marzo, Angelo M.; Dang, Chi V.] Johns Hopkins Univ, Sch Med, Dept Pathol, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA; [De Marzo, Angelo M.; Dang, Chi V.] Johns Hopkins Univ, Sch Med, Dept Oncol, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA; [De Marzo, Angelo M.] Johns Hopkins Univ, Sch Med, Dept Urol, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA; [Van Eyk, Jennifer E.] Johns Hopkins Univ, Sch Med, Dept Biol Chem, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA; [Dang, Chi V.] Johns Hopkins Univ, Sch Med, Dept Cell Biol, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA; [Kita, Kayoko; Ochi, Takafumi] Teikyo Univ, Fac Pharmaceut Sci, Toxicol Lab, Kanagawa 2290195, Japan","Dang, CV (reprint author), Johns Hopkins Univ, Sch Med, Dept Med, Div Hematol, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA.",pgao2@jhmi.edu; cvdang@jhmi.edu,"Chang, Tsung-Cheng/C-2761-2008; Zhang, Huafeng/A-7188-2012","Chang, Tsung-Cheng/0000-0003-4706-0468; ","NIH [NHLBI NO1-HV-28180, NCI R01CA051497, NCI R01CA57341, NCI R01CA120185, NCI P50CA58236]; Rita Allen Foundation; Leukemia and Lymphoma Society; Sol Goldman Center for Pancreatic Cancer Research","The authors want to thank L.

The resulting induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells resemble embryonic stem cells in their properties and potential to differentiate into a spectrum of adult cell types. Current reprogramming strategies involve retroviral(1), lentiviral(5), adenoviral(6) and plasmid(7) transfection to deliver reprogramming factor transgenes. Although the latter two methods are transient and minimize the potential for insertion mutagenesis, they are currently limited by diminished reprogramming efficiencies. piggyBac (PB) transposition is host-factor independent, and has recently been demonstrated to be functional in various human and mouse cell lines(8-11). The PB transposon/transposase system requires only the inverted terminal repeats flanking a transgene and transient expression of the transposase enzyme to catalyse insertion or excision events(12). Here we demonstrate successful and efficient reprogramming of murine and human embryonic fibroblasts using doxycycline-inducible transcription factors delivered by PB transposition(13). Stable iPS cells thus generated express characteristic pluripotency markers and succeed in a series of rigorous differentiation assays. By taking advantage of the natural propensity of the PB system for seamless excision(12), we show that the individual PB insertions can be removed from established iPS cell lines, providing an invaluable tool for discovery. In addition, we have demonstrated the traceless removal of reprogramming factors joined with viral 2A sequences(14) delivered by a single transposon from murine iPS lines. We anticipate that the unique properties of this virus-independent simplification of iPS cell production will accelerate this field further towards full exploration of the reprogramming process and future cell-based therapies.","[Woltjen, Knut; Michael, Iacovos P.; Mohseni, Paria; Desai, Ridham; Mileikovsky, Maria; Haemaelaeinen, Riikka; Cowling, Rebecca; Gertsenstein, Marina; Sung, Hoon-Ki; Nagy, Andras] Mt Sinai Hosp, Samuel Lunenfeld Res Inst, Toronto, ON M5G 1X5, Canada; [Michael, Iacovos P.; Mohseni, Paria; Desai, Ridham; Nagy, Andras] Univ Toronto, Dept Mol Genet, Toronto, ON M5S 1A8, Canada; [Wang, Wei; Liu, Pentao] Wellcome Trust Sanger Inst, Hinxton CB10 1SA, Cambs, England; [Kaji, Keisuke] Univ Edinburgh, Inst Stem Cell Res, Ctr Regenerat Med, MRC, Edinburgh EH9 3JQ, Midlothian, Scotland","Nagy, A (reprint author), Mt Sinai Hosp, Samuel Lunenfeld Res Inst, 600 Univ Ave, Toronto, ON M5G 1X5, Canada.",nagy@lunenfeld.ca,"Sung, Hoon-Ki /G-3049-2013; Nagy, Andras/G-6465-2013; Michael, Iacovos/C-8695-2016","Nagy, Andras/0000-0003-4311-0413; Michael, Iacovos/0000-0001-7674-1233",Wellcome Trust; Canadian Stem Cell Network; JDRF,"We thank J.

Most instances of direct reprogramming have been achieved by forced expression of defined factors using multiple viral vectors(1-7). However, such iPS cells contain a large number of viral vector integrations(1,8), any one of which could cause unpredictable genetic dysfunction. Whereas c-Myc is dispensable for reprogramming(9,10), complete elimination of the other exogenous factors is also desired because ectopic expression of either Oct4 (also known as Pou5f1) or Klf4 can induce dysplasia(11,12). Two transient transfection-reprogramming methods have been published to address this issue(13,14). However, the efficiency of both approaches is extremely low, and neither has been applied successfully to human cells so far. Here we show that non-viral transfection of a single multiprotein expression vector, which comprises the coding sequences of c-Myc, Klf4, Oct4 and Sox2 linked with 2A peptides, can reprogram both mouse and human fibroblasts. Moreover, the transgene can be removed once reprogramming has been achieved. iPS cells produced with this nonviral vector show robust expression of pluripotency markers, indicating a reprogrammed state confirmed functionally by in vitro differentiation assays and formation of adult chimaeric mice. When the single-vector reprogramming system was combined with a piggyBac transposon(15,16), we succeeded in establishing reprogrammed human cell lines from embryonic fibroblasts with robust expression of pluripotency markers. This system minimizes genome modification in iPS cells and enables complete elimination of exogenous reprogramming factors, efficiently providing iPS cells that are applicable to regenerative medicine, drug screening and the establishment of disease models.","[Kaji, Keisuke; Norrby, Katherine; Paca, Agnieszka] Univ Edinburgh, Inst Stem Cell Res, Ctr Regenerat Med, MRC, Edinburgh EH9 3JQ, Midlothian, Scotland; [Mileikovsky, Maria; Mohseni, Paria; Woltjen, Knut] Mt Sinai Hosp, Samuel Lunenfeld Res Inst, Toronto, ON M5G 1X5, Canada; [Mohseni, Paria] Univ Toronto, Dept Mol Genet, Toronto, ON M5S 1A8, Canada","Kaji, K (reprint author), Univ Edinburgh, Inst Stem Cell Res, Ctr Regenerat Med, MRC, Edinburgh EH9 3JQ, Midlothian, Scotland.",keisuke.kaji@ed.ac.uk,,,MRC; BBSRC; Canadian Stem Cell Network; Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation,"We thank A.

Here we show that the loss of Smoothened (Smo), an essential component of the Hh pathway(2), impairs haematopoietic stem cell renewal and decreases induction of chronic myelogenous leukaemia (CML) by the BCR-ABL1 oncoprotein(3). Loss of Smo causes depletion of CML stem cells-the cells that propagate the leukaemia-whereas constitutively active Smo augments CML stem cell number and accelerates disease. As a possible mechanism for Smo action, we show that the cell fate determinant Numb, which depletes CML stem cells, is increased in the absence of Smo activity. Furthermore, pharmacological inhibition of Hh signalling impairs not only the propagation of CML driven by wild-type BCR-ABL1, but also the growth of imatinib-resistant mouse and human CML. These data indicate that Hh pathway activity is required for maintenance of normal and neoplastic stem cells of the haematopoietic system and raise the possibility that the drug resistance and disease recurrence associated with imatinib treatment of CML(4,5) might be avoided by targeting this essential stem cell maintenance pathway.","[Zhao, Chen; Chen, Alan; Fereshteh, Mark; Blum, Jordan; Kwon, Hyog Young; Reya, Tannishtha] Duke Univ, Med Ctr, Dept Pharmacol & Canc Biol, Durham, NC 27710 USA; [Chute, John P.; Rizzieri, David] Duke Univ, Med Ctr, Dept Med, Div Cellular Therapy, Durham, NC 27710 USA; [Jamieson, Catriona H.; Abrahamsson, Annelie] Moores UCSD Canc Ctr Jolla, Stem Cell Res Program, Dept Med, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Kim, Jynho; Beachy, Philip A.] Stanford Univ, Med Ctr, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Dept Dev Biol,Inst Stem Cell Biol & Regenerat Med, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Munchhof, Michael] Pfizer Labs, Div Med Chem, Groton, CT 06340 USA; [VanArsdale, Todd] Pfizer Labs, Div Oncol, La Jolla, CA 92121 USA","Reya, T (reprint author), Duke Univ, Med Ctr, Dept Pharmacol & Canc Biol, Durham, NC 27710 USA.",t.reya@duke.edu,,,"CRI; EMF; Leukemia and Lymphoma Society; Duke Molecular Cancer Biology Training; California Institute of Regenerative Medicine; National Institutes of Health [DK63031, DK072234, AI067798]; Lisa Stafford Memorial Prize","We wish to thank R.

It has recently been shown that central nervous system stem cells(1,2) and haematopoietic stem cells and early progenitors(3-6) contain lower levels of ROS than their more mature progeny, and that these differences are critical for maintaining stem cell function. We proposed that epithelial tissue stem cells and their cancer stem cell (CSC) counterparts may also share this property. Here we show that normal mammary epithelial stem cells contain lower concentrations of ROS than their more mature progeny cells. Notably, subsets of CSCs in some human and murine breast tumours contain lower ROS levels than corresponding non-tumorigenic cells (NTCs). Consistent with ROS being critical mediators of ionizing-radiation-induced cell killing(7,8), CSCs in these tumours develop less DNA damage and are preferentially spared after irradiation compared to NTCs. Lower ROS levels in CSCs are associated with increased expression of free radical scavenging systems. Pharmacological depletion of ROS scavengers in CSCs markedly decreases their clonogenicity and results in radiosensitization. These results indicate that, similar to normal tissue stem cells, subsets of CSCs in some tumours contain lower ROS levels and enhanced ROS defences compared to their non-tumorigenic progeny, which may contribute to tumour radioresistance.","[Diehn, Maximilian; Cho, Robert W.; Lobo, Neethan A.; Kulp, Angela N.; Qian, Dalong; Lam, Jessica S.; Ailles, Laurie E.; Wong, Manzhi; Weissman, Irving L.; Clarke, Michael F.] Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Stanford Inst Stem Cell Biol & Regenerat Med, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Diehn, Maximilian; Dorie, Mary Jo; Brown, J.

XRN2, or Rat1 in yeast(6), functions primarily in the nucleus and also has an important role in transcription termination by RNA polymerase II (refs 7-14). Rat1 exoribonuclease activity is stimulated by the protein Rai1 (refs 15, 16). Here we report the crystal structure at 2.2 angstrom resolution of Schizosaccharomyces pombe Rat1 in complex with Rai1, as well as the structures of Rai1 and its murine homologue Dom3Z alone at 2.0 angstrom resolution. The structures reveal the molecular mechanism for the activation of Rat1 by Rai1 and for the exclusive exoribonuclease activity of Rat1. Biochemical studies confirm these observations, and show that Rai1 allows Rat1 to degrade RNAs with stable secondary structure more effectively. There are large differences in the active site landscape of Rat1 compared to related and PIN (PilT N terminus) domain-containing nucleases(17-20). Unexpectedly, we identified a large pocket in Rai1 and Dom3Z that contains highly conserved residues, including three acidic side chains that coordinate a divalent cation. Mutagenesis and biochemical studies demonstrate that Rai1 possesses pyrophosphohydrolase activity towards 5' triphosphorylated RNA. Such an activity is important for messenger RNA degradation in bacteria(21), but this is, to our knowledge, the first demonstration of this activity in eukaryotes and suggests that Rai1/Dom3Z may have additional important functions in RNA metabolism.","[Xiang, Song; Cooper-Morgan, Amalene; Manley, James L.; Tong, Liang] Columbia Univ, Dept Biol Sci, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Jiao, Xinfu; Kiledjian, Megerditch] Rutgers State Univ, Dept Cell Biol & Neurosci, Piscataway, NJ 08854 USA","Tong, L (reprint author), Columbia Univ, Dept Biol Sci, New York, NY 10027 USA.",ltong@columbia.edu,,"Tong, Liang/0000-0002-0563-6468; Manley, James/0000-0002-8341-1459; xiang (Xiang), song (Song)/0000-0001-9314-4684","NIH [GM077175, GM28983, GM67005]","We thank R.

Here we report the crystal structure of the gap junction channel formed by human connexin 26 (Cx26, also known as GJB2) at 3.5 angstrom resolution, and discuss structural determinants of solute transport through the channel. The density map showed the two membrane-spanning hemichannels and the arrangement of the four transmembrane helices of the six protomers forming each hemichannel. The hemichannels feature a positively charged cytoplasmic entrance, a funnel, a negatively charged transmembrane pathway, and an extracellular cavity. The pore is narrowed at the funnel, which is formed by the six amino-terminal helices lining the wall of the channel, which thus determines the molecular size restriction at the channel entrance. The structure of the Cx26 gap junction channel also has implications for the gating of the channel by the transjunctional voltage.","[Maeda, Shoji; Nakagawa, So; Suga, Michihiro; Yamashita, Eiki; Tsukihara, Tomitake] Osaka Univ, OLABB, Inst Prot Res, Osaka 5650874, Japan; [Oshima, Atsunori; Fujiyoshi, Yoshinori] Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Sci, Dept Biophys, Sakyo Ku, Kyoto 6068502, Japan; [Tsukihara, Tomitake] Univ Hyogo, Grad Sch Life Sci, Picobiol Inst, Akoh, Hyogo 6781297, Japan","Tsukihara, T (reprint author), Osaka Univ, OLABB, Inst Prot Res, 6-2-3 Furuedai, Osaka 5650874, Japan.",tsuki@protein.osaka-u.ac.jp,"Oshima, Atsunori/F-8346-2010; Fujiyoshi, Yoshinori/E-5989-2012; Suga, Michi/C-2870-2015",,"Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology of Japan [10687101, 16087206, 18207006, A-041]; Japan Biological Informatics Consortium; Strategic Japan-UK Cooperation Program of the Japan Science and Technology Agency; New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization; Grants-in-Aid for Specially Promoted Research","We thank T.

Stars begin to form relatively quickly in sub-galactic-sized building blocks called haloes which are subsequently assembled into galaxies. However, exactly when this assembly takes place is a matter of some debate(2,3). Here we report that the stellar masses of brightest cluster galaxies, which are the most luminous objects emitting stellar light, some 9 billion years ago are not significantly different from their stellar masses today. Brightest cluster galaxies are almost fully assembled 425 billion years after the Big Bang, having grown to more than 90 per cent of their final stellar mass by this time. Our data conflict with the most recent galaxy formation models(4,5) based on the largest simulations of dark-matter halo development(1). These models predict protracted formation of brightest cluster galaxies over a Hubble time, with only 22 per cent of the stellar mass assembled at the epoch probed by our sample. Our findings suggest a new picture in which brightest cluster galaxies experience an early period of rapid growth rather than prolonged hierarchical assembly.","[Collins, Chris A.; Stott, John P.; Hilton, Matt] Liverpool John Moores Univ, Astrophys Res Inst, Birkenhead CH41 1LD, Merseyside, England; [Hilton, Matt] Univ KwaZulu Natal, Sch Math Sci, Astrophys & Cosmol Res Unit, ZA-4000 Durban, South Africa; [Hilton, Matt] S African Astron Observ, ZA-7935 Cape Town, South Africa; [Kay, Scott T.] Univ Manchester, Sch Phys & Astron, Jodrell Bank, Ctr Astrophys, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England; [Stanford, S.

Positrons might also originate in objects such as pulsars(2) and microquasars(3) or through dark matter annihilation(4), which would be 'primary sources'. Previous statistically limited measurements(5-7) of the ratio of positron and electron fluxes have been interpreted as evidence for a primary source for the positrons, as has an increase in the total electron+positron flux at energies between 300 and 600 GeV (ref. 8). Here we report a measurement of the positron fraction in the energy range 1.5-100 GeV. We find that the positron fraction increases sharply overmuch of that range, in a way that appears to be completely inconsistent with secondary sources. We therefore conclude that a primary source, be it an astrophysical object or dark matter annihilation, is necessary.","[Casolino, M.; De Pascale, M.

D.",,,Emergence of the persistent spin helix in semiconductor quantum wells,NATURE,,,English,Article,,,,,,,GRATINGS,"According to Noether's theorem(1), for every symmetry in nature there is a corresponding conservation law. For example, invariance with respect to spatial translation corresponds to conservation of momentum. In another well-known example, invariance with respect to rotation of the electron's spin, or SU(2) symmetry, leads to conservation of spin polarization. For electrons in a solid, this symmetry is ordinarily broken by spin-orbit coupling, allowing spin angular momentum to flow to orbital angular momentum. However, it has recently been predicted that SU(2) can be achieved in a two-dimensional electron gas, despite the presence of spin-orbit coupling(2). The corresponding conserved quantities include the amplitude and phase of a helical spin density wave termed the 'persistent spin helix'(2). SU(2) is realized, in principle, when the strengths of two dominant spin-orbit interactions, the Rashba(3) (strength parameterized by alpha) and linear Dresselhaus(4) (beta(1)) interactions, are equal. This symmetry is predicted to be robust against all forms of spin-independent scattering, including electron-electron interactions, but is broken by the cubic Dresselhaus term (beta(3)) and spin-dependent scattering. When these terms are negligible, the distance over which spin information can propagate is predicted to diverge as alpha approaches beta(1). Here we report experimental observation of the emergence of the persistent spin helix in GaAs quantum wells by independently tuning alpha and beta(1). Using transient spin-grating spectroscopy(5), we find a spin-lifetime enhancement of two orders of magnitude near the symmetry point. Excellent quantitative agreement with theory across a wide range of sample parameters allows us to obtain an absolute measure of all relevant spin-orbit terms, identifying beta(3) as the main SU(2)violating term in our samples. The tunable suppression of spin relaxation demonstrated in this work is well suited for application to spintronics(6,7).","[Koralek, J. D.; Weber, C.

It is difficult, however, to assess the long-term consequences of CO2 flooding in the subsurface from decadal observations of existing disposal sites(1,2). Both the site design and long-term safety modelling critically depend on how and where CO2 will be stored in the site over its lifetime(2-4). Within a geological storage site, the injected CO2 can dissolve in solution or precipitate as carbonate minerals. Here we identify and quantify the principal mechanism of CO2 fluid phase removal in nine natural gas fields in North America, China and Europe, using noble gas and carbon isotope tracers. The natural gas fields investigated in our study are dominated by a CO2 phase and provide a natural analogue for assessing the geological storage of anthropogenic CO2 over millennial timescales(1,2,5,6). We find that in seven gas fields with siliciclastic or carbonate-dominated reservoir lithologies, dissolution in formation water at a pH of 5-5.8 is the sole major sink for CO2. In two fields with siliciclastic reservoir lithologies, some CO2 loss through precipitation as carbonate minerals cannot be ruled out, but can account for a maximum of 18 per cent of the loss of emplaced CO2. In view of our findings that geological mineral fixation is a minor CO2 trapping mechanism in natural gas fields, we suggest that long-term anthropogenic CO2 storage models in similar geological systems should focus on the potential mobility of CO2 dissolved in water.","[Gilfillan, Stuart M.

However, a quantitative petrological comparison has never been made between mantle source temperature and the extent of melting for OIB and LIP sources. Here we show that the MgO and FeO contents of Galapagos related lavas and their primary magmas have decreased since the Cretaceous period. From petrological modelling(2), we infer that these changes reflect a cooling of the Galapagos mantle plume from a potential temperature of 1,560-1,620 degrees C in the Cretaceous to 1,500 degrees C at present. Iceland also exhibits secular cooling, in agreement with previous studies(3,4). Our work provides quantitative petrological evidence that, in general, mantle plumes for LIPs with Palaeocene-Permian ages were hotter and melted more extensively than plumes of more modern ocean islands. We interpret this to reflect episodic flow from lower-mantle domains that are lithologically and geochemically heterogeneous.","[Herzberg, Claude; Gazel, Esteban] Rutgers State Univ, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, Piscataway, NJ 08854 USA","Herzberg, C (reprint author), Rutgers State Univ, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, 610 Taylor Rd, Piscataway, NJ 08854 USA.",herzberg@rci.rutgers.edu,"Gazel, Esteban/B-8090-2012",,,,,35,106,106,3,46,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,2-Apr,2009,458,7238,,,,,619,U83,,10.1038/nature07857,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,427RK,WOS:000264796200038,19340079,No,,,11/20/17

Biodiversity is a complex term that includes taxonomic, functional, spatial and temporal aspects of organismic diversity, with species richness (the number of species) and evenness (the relative abundance of species) considered among the most important measures(4,5). With few exceptions (see, for example, ref. 6), the majority of studies of biodiversity-functioning and biodiversity-stability theory have predominantly examined richness(7-11). Here we show, using microbial microcosms, that initial community evenness is a key factor in preserving the functional stability of an ecosystem. Using experimental manipulations of both richness and initial evenness in microcosms with denitrifying bacterial communities, we found that the stability of the net ecosystem denitrification in the face of salinity stress was strongly influenced by the initial evenness of the community. Therefore, when communities are highly uneven, or there is extreme dominance by one or a few species, their functioning is less resistant to environmental stress. Further unravelling how evenness influences ecosystem processes in natural and humanized environments constitutes a major future conceptual challenge.","[Wittebolle, Lieven; Marzorati, Massimo; Verstraete, Willy; Boon, Nico] Univ Ghent, Lab Microbial Ecol & Technol, LabMET, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium; [Clement, Lieven] Univ Ghent, BIOSTAT, Dept Appl Math Biometr & Proc Control, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium; [Heylen, Kim; De Vos, Paul] Univ Ghent, Microbiol Lab, Dept Biochem Physiol & Microbiol, LM UGent, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium; [Balloi, Annalisa; Daffonchio, Daniele] Univ Milan, Dipartimento Sci & Tecnol Alimentari & Microbiol, DISTAM, I-20133 Milan, Italy","Boon, N (reprint author), Univ Ghent, Lab Microbial Ecol & Technol, LabMET, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium.",nico.boon@ugent.be,"Heylen, Kim/G-4085-2011; Clement, Lieven /G-5143-2012; Marzorati, Massimo/A-3419-2013; De Vos, Paul/J-5392-2013; Boon, Nico/B-4083-2011","Boon, Nico/0000-0002-7734-3103; Daffonchio, Daniele/0000-0003-0947-925X","Institute for the Promotion of Innovation through Science and Technology in Flanders; Interuniversity Attraction Pole research network grant of the Belgian government, Belgian Science Policy; 'Program Master and Back' from Regione Sardegna; 'Programma dell'Universita' per la Ricerca,; Geconcerteerde Onderzoeksactie of Ghent University; Ministerie van de Vlaamse Gemeenschap; Bestuur Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek","We are grateful to R.

In mammals, the first neurons along the visual pathway that encode binocular disparities are found in the visual cortex. However, a precise functional architecture for binocular disparity has never been demonstrated in any species, and coarse maps for disparity have been found in only one primate species(2,3). Moreover, the dominant approach for assaying the developmental plasticity of binocular cortical neurons used monocular tests of ocular dominance to infer binocular function(4). The few studies that examined the relationship between ocular dominance and binocular disparity of individual cells used single-unit recordings and have provided conflicting results regarding whether ocular dominance can predict the selectivity or sensitivity to binocular disparity(5-9). We used two-photon calcium imaging to sample the response to monocular and binocular visual stimuli from nearly every adjacent neuron in a small region of the cat visual cortex, area 18. Here we show that local circuits for ocular dominance always have smooth and graded transitions from one apparently monocular functional domain to an adjacent binocular region. Most unexpectedly, we discovered a new map in the cat visual cortex that had a precise functional micro-architecture for binocular disparity selectivity. At the level of single cells, ocular dominance was unrelated to binocular disparity selectivity or sensitivity. When the local maps for ocular dominance and binocular disparity both had measurable gradients at a given cortical site, the two gradient directions were orthogonal to each other. Together, these results indicate that, from the perspective of the spiking activity of individual neurons, ocular dominance cannot predict binocular disparity tuning. However, the precise local arrangement of ocular dominance and binocular disparity maps provide new clues regarding how monocular and binocular depth cues may be combined and decoded.","[Kara, Prakash; Boyd, Jamie D.] Med Univ S Carolina, Dept Neurosci, Charleston, SC 29425 USA","Kara, P (reprint author), Med Univ S Carolina, Dept Neurosci, Charleston, SC 29425 USA.",kara@musc.edu,,,NIH; Whitehall; Dana Foundations,"We thank B.

Research suggests that sustained activity in higher-order prefrontal, parietal, inferotemporal and lateral occipital areas supports visual maintenance(3-11), and may account for the limited capacity of working memory to hold up to 3-4 items(9-11). Because higher-order areas lack the visual selectivity of early sensory areas, it has remained unclear how observers can remember specific visual features, such as the precise orientation of a grating, with minimal decay in performance over delays of many seconds(12). One proposal is that sensory areas serve to maintain fine-tuned feature information(13), but early visual areas show little to no sustained activity over prolonged delays(14-16). Here we show that orientations held in working memory can be decoded from activity patterns in the human visual cortex, even when overall levels of activity are low. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging and pattern classification methods, we found that activity patterns in visual areas V1-V4 could predict which of two oriented gratings was held in memory with mean accuracy levels upwards of 80%, even in participants whose activity fell to baseline levels after a prolonged delay. These orientation-selective activity patterns were sustained throughout the delay period, evident in individual visual areas, and similar to the responses evoked by unattended, task-irrelevant gratings. Our results demonstrate that early visual areas can retain specific information about visual features held in working memory, over periods of many seconds when no physical stimulus is present.","[Tong, Frank] Vanderbilt Univ, Dept Psychol, Nashville, TN 37240 USA; Vanderbilt Univ, Vanderbilt Vis Res Ctr, Nashville, TN 37240 USA","Tong, F (reprint author), Vanderbilt Univ, Dept Psychol, Nashville, TN 37240 USA.",frank.tong@vanderbilt.edu,,,National Eye Institute; National Institutes of Health; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada,"We thank D.

To characterize the memory antibody responses to HIV, we cloned 502 antibodies from HIV envelope-binding memory B cells from six HIV-infected patients with broadly neutralizing antibodies and low to intermediate viral loads. We show that in these patients, the B-cell memory response to gp140 is composed of up to 50 independent clones expressing high affinity neutralizing antibodies to the gp120 variable loops, the CD4-binding site, the co-receptor-binding site, and to a new neutralizing epitope that is in the same region of gp120 as the CD4-binding site. Thus, the IgG memory B-cell compartment in the selected group of patients with broad serum neutralizing activity to HIV is comprised of multiple clonal responses with neutralizing activity directed against several epitopes on gp120.","[Scheid, Johannes F.; Mouquet, Hugo; Feldhahn, Niklas; Velinzon, Klara; Pietzsch, John; Nussenzweig, Michel C.] Rockefeller Univ, Lab Mol Immunol, New York, NY 10065 USA; [Ott, Rene G.; Anthony, Robert M.; Ravetch, Jeffrey V.] Rockefeller Univ, Lab Mol Genet & Immunol, New York, NY 10065 USA; [Zebroski, Henry] Rockefeller Univ, Prote Resource Ctr, New York, NY 10065 USA; [Hurley, Arlene] Rockefeller Univ, Rockefeller Univ Hosp, New York, NY 10065 USA; [Nussenzweig, Michel C.] Rockefeller Univ, Howard Hughes Med Inst, New York, NY 10065 USA; [Scheid, Johannes F.] Charite Univ Med Berlin, D-10117 Berlin, Germany; [Seaman, Michael S.] Beth Israel Deaconess Med Ctr, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Pietzsch, John] Free Univ Berlin, Inst Chem & Biochem, D-14195 Berlin, Germany; [Phogat, Adhuna; Chakrabarti, Bimal; Li, Yuxing; Wyatt, Richard T.; Mascola, John R.] NIAID, Vaccine Res Ctr, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Connors, Mark] NIAID, Immunoregulat Lab, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Pereyra, Florencia; Walker, Bruce D.] Mass Gen Hosp, Partners AIDS Res Ctr, Charlestown, MA 02129 USA; [Wardemann, Hedda] Max Planck Inst Infect Biol, D-10117 Berlin, Germany; [Pereyra, Florencia; Walker, Bruce D.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Charlestown, MA 02129 USA; [Ho, David] Aaron Diamond AIDS Res Ctr, New York, NY 10065 USA","Nussenzweig, MC (reprint author), Rockefeller Univ, Lab Mol Immunol, New York, NY 10065 USA.",nussen@mail.rockefeller.edu,"Mouquet, Hugo/M-2750-2014",,Rockefeller University; International Aids Vaccine Initiative; Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation; Intramural Research Program of the Vaccine Research Center; Division of Intramural Research; National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases; National Institutes of Health; Deutscher Akademischer Austauschdienst; Fondation Recherche Medicale,"We thank D.

A focal point is the interaction between genes encoding human leukocyte antigen (HLA) and those encoding HIV proteins. HLA molecules present fragments (epitopes) of HIV proteins on the surface of infected cells to enable immune recognition and killing by CD8(+) T cells; particular HLA molecules, such as HLA-B*57, HLA-B*27 and HLA-B*51, are more likely to mediate successful control of HIV infection(1). Mutation within these epitopes can allow viral escape from CD8(+) T-cell recognition. Here we analysed viral sequences and HLA alleles from. 2,800 subjects, drawn from 9 distinct study cohorts spanning 5 continents. Initial analysis of the HLA-B*51-restricted epitope, TAFTIPSI (reverse transcriptase residues 128135), showed a strong correlation between the frequency of the escape mutation I135X and HLA-B*51 prevalence in the 9 study cohorts (P=0.0001). Extending these analyses to incorporate other well-defined CD8(+) T-cell epitopes, including those restricted by HLA-B*57 and HLA-B*27, showed that the frequency of these epitope variants (n=14) was consistently correlated with the prevalence of the restricting HLA allele in the different cohorts (together, P < 0.0001), demonstrating strong evidence of HIV adaptation to HLA at a population level. This process of viral adaptation may dismantle the well-established HLA associations with control of HIV infection that are linked to the availability of key epitopes, and highlights the challenge for a vaccine to keep pace with the changing immunological landscape presented by HIV.","[Pfafferott, Katja; Matthews, Philippa; Payne, Rebecca; Prendergast, Andrew; Crawford, Hayley; Leslie, Alasdair; Prado, Julia G.; Goulder, Philip] Dept Paediat, Oxford OX1 3SY, England; [Frater, John; Duda, Anna; Klenerman, Paul; Phillips, Rodney] Nuffield Dept Clin Med, Oxford OX1 3SY, England; [Frater, John; Duda, Anna; Klenerman, Paul; Phillips, Rodney] James Martin 21st Century Sch, Oxford OX1 3SY, England; [Kawashima, Yuka; Fujiwara, Mamoru; Hachiya, Atsuko; Koizumi, Hirokazu; Kuse, Nozomi; Takiguchi, Masafumi] Kumamoto Univ, Div Viral Immunol, Kumamoto 8600811, Japan; [Gatanaga, Hiroyuki; Oka, Shinichi] Kumamoto Univ, Div Infect Dis, Ctr AIDS Res, Kumamoto 8600811, Japan; [Pfafferott, Katja; John, Mina; Mallal, Simon; Goulder, Philip] Royal Perth Hosp, Ctr Clin Immunol & Biomed Stat, Perth, WA 6000, Australia; [Pfafferott, Katja; John, Mina; Mallal, Simon; Goulder, Philip] Murdoch Univ, Murdoch, WA 6000, Australia; [Addo, Marylyn; Brumme, Zabrina; Brumme, Chanson; Allen, Todd; Brander, Christian; Walker, Bruce D.] Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Partners AIDS Res Ctr, Boston, MA 02129 USA; [Gatanaga, Hiroyuki; Hachiya, Atsuko; Oka, Shinichi] Int Med Ctr Japan, AIDS Clin Ctr, Shinjuku Ku, Tokyo 1628655, Japan; [Brander, Christian] Hosp Badalona Germans Trias & Pujol, Fundacio IrsiCaixa HIVACAT, Badalona, Spain; [Brander, Christian] ICREA, Barcelona 08916, Spain; [Kaslow, Richard; Tang, James] Univ Alabama Birmingham, Birmingham, AL 35294 USA; [Hunter, Eric] Emory Univ, Vaccine Ctr, Atlanta, GA 30329 USA; [Hunter, Eric] Yerkes Natl Primate Res Ctr, Atlanta, GA 30329 USA; [Allen, Susan; Mulenga, Joseph] Zambia Emory HIV Res Project, Lusaka, Zambia; [Allen, Susan; Mulenga, Joseph] Zambia Blood Transfus Serv, Lusaka, Zambia; [Branch, Songee; Roach, Tim] Univ W Indies, Ladymeade Reference Unit, BB-11156 Bridgetown, Barbados; [Ogwu, Anthony; Shapiro, Roger] Botswana Harvard Sch Publ Hlth, AIDS Initiat Partnership, Gaborone, Botswana; [Fidler, Sarah; Weber, Jonathan] Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, St Marys Hosp, Wright Fleming Inst, Div Med, London W2 1PG, England; [Pybus, Oliver G.] Univ Oxford, Dept Zool, Oxford OX1 3SY, England; [Ndung'u, Thumbi; Walker, Bruce D.; Goulder, Philip] Univ KwaZulu Natal, Doris Duke Med Res Inst, HIV Pathogenesis Programme, ZA-4013 Durban, South Africa; [Harrigan, P.

Capsid shells are complex organizations of hundreds of protein subunits that assemble into intricate quaternary complexes that ultimately are able to withstand over 50 atm of pressure during genome packaging(1). The extensive integration between subunits in capsids requires the formation of an intermediate complex, termed a procapsid, from which individual subunits can undergo the necessary refolding and structural rearrangements needed to transition to the more stable capsid. Although various mature capsids have been characterized at atomic resolution, no such procapsid structure is available for a dsDNA virus or bacteriophage. Here we present a procapsid X-ray structure at 3.65 angstrom resolution, termed prohead II, of the lambda-like bacteriophage HK97, the mature capsid structure of which was previously solved to 3.44 angstrom (ref. 2). A comparison of the two largely different capsid forms has unveiled an unprecedented expansion mechanism that describes the transition. Crystallographic and hydrogen/deuterium exchange data presented here demonstrate that the subunit tertiary structures are significantly different between the two states, with twisting and bending motions occurring in both helical and beta-sheet regions. We also identified subunit interactions at each three-fold axis of the capsid that are maintained throughout maturation. The interactions sustain capsid integrity during subunit refolding and provide a fixed hinge from which subunits undergo rotational and translational motions during maturation. Previously published calorimetric data of a closely related bacteriophage, P22, showed that capsid maturation was an exothermic process that resulted in a release of 90 kJ mol(-1) of energy(3). We propose that the major tertiary changes presented in this study reveal a structural basis for an exothermic maturation process probably present in many dsDNA bacteriophage and possibly viruses such as herpesvirus, which share the HK97 subunit fold(4).","[Gertsman, Ilya; Gan, Lu; Lee, Kelly; Speir, Jeffrey A.; Johnson, John E.] Scripps Res Inst, Dept Mol Biol, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; [Gertsman, Ilya; Guttman, Miklos; Komives, Elizabeth A.; Johnson, John E.] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Chem & Biochem, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; [Duda, Robert L.; Hendrix, Roger W.] Univ Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh Bacteriophage Inst, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA; [Duda, Robert L.; Hendrix, Roger W.] Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Biol Sci, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA","Johnson, JE (reprint author), Scripps Res Inst, Dept Mol Biol, 10666 N Torrey Pines Rd, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA.",jackj@scripps.edu,"Gan, Lu/F-8317-2011","Gan, Lu/0000-0002-8685-4896","NIH [RO1 AI40101, RO1 GM47795]; NIH Training Grant [GM08326]","We thank V.

Specialized groups of cilia have critical roles in embryonic development, including left-right axis formation. Recently, cilia have been implicated as recipients of cell-cell signalling(1,2). However, little is known about cell-cell signalling pathways that control the length of cilia(3). Here we provide several lines of evidence showing that fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signalling regulates cilia length and function in diverse epithelia during zebrafish and Xenopus development. Morpholino knockdown of FGF receptor 1 (Fgfr1) in zebrafish cell-autonomously reduces cilia length in Kupffer's vesicle and perturbs directional fluid flow required for left-right patterning of the embryo. Expression of a dominant-negative FGF receptor (DN-Fgfr1), treatment with SU5402 ( a pharmacological inhibitor of FGF signalling) or genetic and morpholino reduction of redundant FGF ligands Fgf8 and Fgf24 reproduces this cilia length phenotype. Knockdown of Fgfr1 also results in shorter tethering cilia in the otic vesicle and shorter motile cilia in the pronephric ducts. In Xenopus, expression of a dn-fgfr1 results in shorter monocilia in the gastrocoel roof plate that control left-right patterning(4) and in shorter multicilia in external mucociliary epithelium. Together, these results indicate a fundamental and highly conserved role for FGF signalling in the regulation of cilia length in multiple tissues. Abrogation of Fgfr1 signalling downregulates expression of two ciliogenic transcription factors, foxj1 and rfx2, and of the intraflagellar transport gene ift88 (also known as polaris), indicating that FGF signalling mediates cilia length through an Fgf8/Fgf24-Fgfr1-intraflagellar transport pathway. We propose that a subset of developmental defects and diseases ascribed to FGF signalling are due in part to loss of cilia function.","[Neugebauer, Judith M.; Amack, Jeffrey D.; Peterson, Annita G.; Bisgrove, Brent W.; Yost, H.

For Ca2+ signals initiated by inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP(3)), this requires local interactions between InsP(3) receptors (InsP(3)Rs)(3,4) mediated by their rapid stimulation and slower inhibition(4) by cytosolic Ca2+. This allows hierarchical recruitment of Ca2+ release events as the InsP(3) concentration increases(5). Single InsP(3)Rs respond first, then clustered InsP(3)Rs open together giving a local 'Ca2+ puff', and as puffs become more frequent they ignite regenerative Ca2+ waves(1,5-9). Using nuclear patch-clamp recording(10), here we demonstrate that InsP(3)Rs are initially randomly distributed with an estimated separation of similar to 1 mu m. Low concentrations of InsP(3) cause InsP(3)Rs to aggregate rapidly and reversibly into small clusters of about four closely associated InsP(3)Rs. At resting cytosolic [Ca2+], clustered InsP(3)Rs open independently, but with lower open probability, shorter open time, and less InsP(3) sensitivity than lone InsP(3)Rs. Increasing cytosolic [Ca2+] reverses the inhibition caused by clustering, InsP(3)R gating becomes coupled, and the duration of multiple openings is prolonged. Clustering both exposes InsP(3)Rs to local Ca2+ rises and increases the effects of Ca2+. Dynamic regulation of clustering by InsP(3) retunes InsP(3)R sensitivity to InsP(3) and Ca2+, facilitating hierarchical recruitment of the elementary events that underlie all InsP(3)-evoked Ca2+ signals(3,5).","[TaufiqUrRahman; Taylor, Colin W.] Univ Cambridge, Dept Pharmacol, Cambridge CB2 1PD, England; [Skupin, Alexander; Falcke, Martin] Max Delbruck Ctr Mol Med, D-13092 Berlin, Germany; [Falcke, Martin] Helmholtz Ctr Berlin Mat & Energy, D-14109 Berlin, Germany","Taylor, CW (reprint author), Univ Cambridge, Dept Pharmacol, Tennis Court Rd, Cambridge CB2 1PD, England.",cwt1000@cam.ac.uk,"Falcke, Martin/I-2966-2012","SKUPIN, Alexander/0000-0002-8955-8304",The Wellcome Trust; The Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council; Jameel Family Trust; IRTG 'Genomics and Systems Biology of Molecular Networks' of the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft,"This work was supported by The Wellcome Trust ( C.

An electron density map of the functional core of U1 snRNP at 5.5 angstrom resolution has enabled us to build the RNA and, in conjunction with site-specific labelling of individual proteins, to place the seven Sm proteins, U1-C and U1-70K into the map. Here we present the detailed structure of a spliceosomal snRNP, revealing a hierarchical network of intricate interactions between subunits. A striking feature is the amino (N)-terminal polypeptide of U1-70K, which extends over a distance of 180 angstrom from its RNA binding domain, wraps around the core domain consisting of the seven Sm proteins and finally contacts U1-C, which is crucial for 5'-splice-site recognition.

Because timescales around stellar-mass black holes are orders of magnitude smaller than those around more distant supermassive black holes, microquasars are ideal nearby 'laboratories' for studying the evolution of accretion disks and jet formation in black-hole systems(2). Whereas studies of black holes have revealed a complex array of accretion activity, the mechanisms that trigger and suppress jet formation remain a mystery. Here we report the presence of a broad emission line in the faint, hard states and narrow absorption lines in the bright, soft states of the microquasar GRS 1915+105. ('Hard' and 'soft' denote the character of the emitted X-rays.) Because the hard states exhibit prominent radio jets(3), we argue that the broad emission line arises when the jet illuminates the inner accretion disk. The jet is weak or absent during the soft states(4), and we show that the absorption lines originate when the powerful radiation field around the black hole drives a hot wind off the accretion disk(5-7). Our analysis shows that this wind carries enough mass away from the disk to halt the flow of matter into the radio jet.","[Neilsen, Joseph; Lee, Julia C.] Harvard Univ, Dept Astron, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA","Neilsen, J (reprint author), Harvard Univ, Dept Astron, 60 Garden St,MS-10, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",jneilsen@cfa.harvard.edu,"Lee, Julia/G-2381-2015","Lee, Julia/0000-0002-7336-3588; Neilsen, Joseph/0000-0002-8247-786X",Harvard University Graduate School of Arts and Sciences; Faculty of Arts and Sciences,"We acknowledge support from the Harvard University Graduate School of Arts and Sciences (J.N.) and the Faculty of Arts and Sciences (J.C.L.).

This conventional e.m.f. is usually absent for stationary circuits and static magnetic fields. There are also forces that act on the spin of an electron; it has been recently predicted(1,2) that, for circuits that are in part composed of ferromagnetic materials, there arises an e.m.f. of spin origin even for a static magnetic field. This e.m.f. can be attributed to a time-varying magnetization of the host material, such as the motion of magnetic domains in a static magnetic field, and reflects the conversion of magnetic to electrical energy. Here we show that such an e.m.f. can indeed be induced by a static magnetic field in magnetic tunnel junctions containing zinc-blende-structured MnAs quantum nanomagnets. The observed e.m.f. operates on a timescale of approximately 10(2)-10(3) seconds and results from the conversion of the magnetic energy of the superparamagnetic MnAs nanomagnets into electrical energy when these magnets undergo magnetic quantum tunnelling. As a consequence, a huge magnetoresistance of up to 100,000 per cent is observed for certain bias voltages. Our results strongly support the contention that, in magnetic nanostructures, Faraday's law of induction must be generalized to account for forces of purely spin origin. The huge magnetoresistance and e.m.f. may find potential applications in high sensitivity magnetic sensors, as well as in new active devices such as 'spin batteries'.","[Hai, Pham Nam; Ohya, Shinobu; Tanaka, Masaaki] Univ Tokyo, Dept Elect Engn & Informat Syst, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo 1138656, Japan; [Ohya, Shinobu; Tanaka, Masaaki] Japan Sci & Technol Agcy, Kawaguchi, Saitama 3320012, Japan; [Barnes, Stewart E.] Univ Miami, Dept Phys, Coral Gables, FL 33124 USA; [Barnes, Stewart E.] Univ Cambridge, Cavendish Lab, TCM, Cambridge CB3 0HE, England; [Maekawa, Sadamichi] Tohoku Univ, Inst Mat Res, Sendai, Miyagi 9808577, Japan; [Maekawa, Sadamichi] Japan Sci & Technol Agcy, CREST, Tokyo 1000075, Japan","Tanaka, M (reprint author), Univ Tokyo, Dept Elect Engn & Informat Syst, Bunkyo Ku, 7-3-1 Hongo, Tokyo 1138656, Japan.",masaaki@ee.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp,"Cavendish, TCM/C-9489-2009",,"MEXT, PRESTO of JST, and EPSRC (UK) [18106007, 19048018, 20686002]; JSPS Research Fellowship","This work was partly supported by Grant-in-Aids for Scientific Research No. 18106007, No. 19048018 and No. 20686002, the Special Coordination Programs for Promoting Science and Technology, and R&D for Next-Generation Information Technology by MEXT, PRESTO of JST, and EPSRC (UK).

But this input from the continents is not balanced by the loss of the elements and isotopes through hydrothermal and sedimentary exchange with the oceanic crust, or by temporal changes in the marine inventory for elements that are demonstrably not in steady state(1-4). To resolve the problem of the observed imbalance in marine geochemical budgets, attention has been focused on uncertainties in the hydrothermal and sedimentary fluxes(1-4). In recent Earth history, temporally dynamic chemical weathering fluxes from the continents are an inevitable consequence of periodic glaciations(5-9). Chemical weathering rates on modern Earth are likely to remain far from equilibrium owing to the physical production of finely ground material at glacial terminations(10-13) that acts as a fertile substrate for chemical weathering. Here we explore the implications of temporal changes in the riverine chemical weathering flux for oceanic geochemical budgets. We contend that the riverine flux obtained from observations of modern rivers is broadly accurate, but not representative of time-scales appropriate for elements with oceanic residence longer than Quaternary glacial-interglacial cycles. We suggest that the pulse of rapid chemical weathering initiated at the last deglaciation has not yet decayed away and that weathering rates remain about two to three times the average for an entire late Quaternary glacial cycle. Taking into account the effect of the suggested non-steady-state process on the silicate weathering flux helps to reconcile the modelled marine strontium isotope budget with available data. Overall, we conclude that consideration of the temporal variability in riverine fluxes largely ameliorates long-standing problems with chemical and isotopic mass balances in the ocean.","[Vance, Derek; Foster, Gavin L.] Univ Bristol, Dept Earth Sci, Bristol Isotope Grp, Bristol BS8 1RJ, Avon, England; [Teagle, Damon A.

The column rises, buoyed by entrained and heated ambient air, reaches the neutral-buoyancy level, then spreads radially to form the umbrella. In classical models of strong volcanic plumes, the plume is assumed to remain always axisymmetric and non-rotating. Here we show that the updraught of the rising column induces a hydrodynamic effect not addressed to date-a 'volcanic mesocyclone'. This volcanic mesocyclone sets the entire plume rotating about its axis, as confirmed by an unprecedented analysis of satellite images from the 1991 eruption of Mount Pinatubo(2-4). Destabilized by the rotation, the umbrella loses axial symmetry and becomes lobate in plan view, in accord with satellite records of recent eruptions on Mounts Pinatubo, Manam, Reventador, Okmok, Chaiten and Ruang. The volcanic mesocyclone spawns waterspouts(5,6) or dust devils(6-8), as seen in numerous eruptions, and groups the electric charges about the plume to form the 'lightning sheath' that was so prominent in the recent eruption of Mount Chaiten. The concept of a volcanic mesocyclone provides a unified explanation for a disparate set of poorly understood phenomena in strong volcanic plumes(5-10).","[Chakraborty, Pinaki; Kieffer, Susan W.] Univ Illinois, Dept Geol, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Gioia, Gustavo] Univ Illinois, Dept Mech Sci & Engn, Urbana, IL 61801 USA","Chakraborty, P (reprint author), Univ Illinois, Dept Geol, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.",chakrabo@illinois.edu,,,Walgreen Chair funds; NSF\EAR [06-09712]; NSF\DMR [06-04435],"We acknowledge discussions with A.

Within a column, highly specific synaptic connections are formed to ensure that similar physiological properties are shared by neuron ensembles spanning from the pia to the white matter. Recent studies indicate that synaptic connectivity in the neocortex is sparse and highly specific(3-8) to allow even adjacent neurons to convey information independently(9-12). How this fine-scale microcircuit is constructed to create a functional columnar architecture at the level of individual neurons largely remains a mystery. Here we investigate whether radial clones of excitatory neurons arising from the same mother cell in the developing neocortex serve as a substrate for the formation of this highly specific microcircuit. We labelled ontogenetic radial clones of excitatory neurons in the mouse neocortex by in utero intraventricular injection of enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP)-expressing retroviruses around the onset of the peak phase of neocortical neurogenesis. Multiple-electrode whole-cell recordings were performed to probe synapse formation among these EGFP-labelled sister excitatory neurons in radial clones and the adjacent non-siblings during postnatal stages. We found that radially aligned sister excitatory neurons have a propensity for developing unidirectional chemical synapses with each other rather than with neighbouring non-siblings. Moreover, these synaptic connections display the same interlaminar directional preference as those observed in the mature neocortex. These results indicate that specific microcircuits develop preferentially within ontogenetic radial clones of excitatory neurons in the developing neocortex and contribute to the emergence of functional columnar micro-architectures in the mature neocortex.","[Yu, Yong-Chun; Bultje, Ronald S.; Wang, Xiaoqun; Shi, Song-Hai] Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Dev Biol Program, New York, NY 10065 USA; [Bultje, Ronald S.] Cornell Univ, Weill Med Coll, Dept Pharmacol, New York, NY 10065 USA","Shi, SH (reprint author), Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Dev Biol Program, 1275 York Ave, New York, NY 10065 USA.",shis@mskcc.org,,,March of Dimes Foundation; Whitehall Foundation; Klingenstein Foundation; DANA Foundation; Autism Speaks Foundation; National Alliance for Research on Schizophrenia and Depression (NARSAD); National Institutes of Health,"We thank A.

The interaction of AIM2 with ASC also leads to the formation of the ASC pyroptosome(4), which induces pyroptotic cell death in cells containing caspase-1. Knockdown of AIM2 by short interfering RNA reduced inflammasome/pyroptosome activation by cytoplasmic DNA in human and mouse macrophages, whereas stable expression of AIM2 in the non-responsive human embryonic kidney 293T cell line conferred responsiveness to cytoplasmic DNA.

RNA is sensed by Toll-like receptor members TLR3, TLR7 and TLR8, or by the RNA helicases RIG-I (also known as DDX58) and MDA-5 (IFIH1)(1). Little is known about sensors for cytoplasmic DNA that trigger antiviral and/or inflammatory responses(2-6). The best characterized of these responses involves activation of the TANK-binding kinase (TBK1)-interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) signalling axis to trigger transcriptional induction of type I interferon genes(2,3). A second, less well-defined pathway leads to the activation of an 'inflammasome' that, via caspase-1, controls the catalytic cleavage of the pro-forms of the cytokines IL1 beta and IL18 (refs 6, 7). Using mouse and human cells, here we identify the PYHIN (pyrin and HIN domain-containing protein)(8) family member absent in melanoma 2 (AIM2) as a receptor for cytosolic DNA, which regulates caspase-1. The HIN200 domain of AIM2 binds to DNA, whereas the pyrin domain (but not that of the other PYHIN family members) associates with the adaptor molecule ASC (apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a caspase activation and recruitment domain) to activate both NF-kappa B and caspase-1. Knockdown of Aim2 abrogates caspase-1 activation in response to cytoplasmic double-stranded DNA and the double-stranded DNA vaccinia virus.

Here we demonstrate that the loss of epidermal caspase 8, an important mediator of apoptosis(2), recapitulates several phases of a wound healing response in the mouse. The epidermal hyperplasia in the caspase 8 null skin is the culmination of signals exchanged between epidermal keratinocytes, dermal fibroblasts and leukocytic cells. This reciprocal interaction is initiated by the paracrine signalling of interleukin 1 alpha (IL1 alpha), which activates both skin stem cell proliferation and cutaneous inflammation. The non-canonical secretion of IL1a is induced by a p38-MAPK-mediated upregulation of NALP3 (also known as NLRP3), leading to inflammasome assembly and caspase 1 activation. Notably, the increased proliferation of basal keratinocytes is counterbalanced by the growth arrest of suprabasal keratinocytes in the stratified epidermis by IL1 alpha-dependent NF kappa B signalling. Altogether, our findings illustrate how the loss of caspase 8 can affect more than programmed cell death to alter the local microenvironment and elicit processes common to wound repair and many neoplastic skin disorders.","[Lee, Pedro; Lee, Dai-Jen; Chan, Carol; Chen, Shih-Wei; Jamora, Colin] Div Biol Sci, Sect Cell & Dev Biol, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Ch'en, Irene] Div Biol Sci, Mol Biol Sect, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Jamora, Colin] Dept Med Dermatol, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA","Jamora, C (reprint author), Div Biol Sci, Sect Cell & Dev Biol, Nat Sci Bldg,Room 6311,9500 Gilman Dr,MC 0380, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.",cjamora@ucsd.edu,,,National Institutes of Health (NIAMS) [5R01AR053185-03]; American Skin Association; Dermatology Foundation,"We thank S.

A major focus of research in the field has been on gene regulation by osteoclastogenic cytokines such as receptor activator of NF-kappa B-ligand (RANKL, also known as TNFSF11) and TNF-alpha, both of which have been well documented to contribute to osteoclast terminal differentiation(2,3). A crucial process that has been less well studied is the trafficking of osteoclast precursors to and from the bone surface, where they undergo cell fusion to form the fully differentiated multinucleated cells that mediate bone resorption. Here we report that sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P), a lipid mediator enriched in blood(4,5), induces chemotaxis and regulates the migration of osteoclast precursors not only in culture but also in vivo, contributing to the dynamic control of bone mineral homeostasis. Cells with the properties of osteoclast precursors express functional S1P(1) receptors and exhibit positive chemotaxis along an S1P gradient in vitro. Intravital two-photon imaging of bone tissues showed that a potent S1P(1) agonist, SEW2871, stimulated motility of osteoclast precursor-containing monocytoid populations in vivo. Osteoclast/monocyte (CD11b, also known as ITGAM) lineage-specific conditional S1P(1) knockout mice showed osteoporotic changes due to increased osteoclast attachment to the bone surface. Furthermore, treatment with the S1P(1) agonist FTY720 relieved ovariectomy-induced osteoporosis in mice by reducing the number of mature osteoclasts attached to the bone surface. Together, these data provide evidence that S1P controls the migratory behaviour of osteoclast precursors, dynamically regulating bone mineral homeostasis, and identifies a critical control point in osteoclastogenesis that may have potential as a therapeutic target.","[Ishii, Masaru; Egen, Jackson G.; Germain, Ronald N.] NIDDK, Lymphocyte Biol Sect, Immunol Lab, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Klauschen, Frederick; Meier-Schellersheim, Martin; Germain, Ronald N.] NIDDK, Program Syst Immunol & Infect Dis Modeling, NIAID, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Proia, Richard L.] NIDDK, Genet Dev & Dis Branch, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Ishii, Masaru] Osaka Univ, WPI Immunol Frontier Res Ctr, Lab Biol Imaging, Suita, Osaka 5650871, Japan; [Ishii, Masaru; Saeki, Yukihiko] Natl Osaka Minami Med Ctr, Dept Clin Res, Osaka 5868521, Japan; [Vacher, Jean] Clin Res Inst Montreal, Montreal, PQ H2W 1R7, Canada","Germain, RN (reprint author), NIDDK, Lymphocyte Biol Sect, Immunol Lab, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA.",rgermain@niaid.nih.gov,"Ishii, Masaru/D-2361-2009; Proia, Richard/A-7908-2012; Klauschen, Frederick/C-5637-2015","Egen, Jackson/0000-0003-2053-0837; Proia, Richard/0000-0003-0456-1270",Intramural Research Program of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases; NIH; US Department of Health and Human Services; International Human Frontier Science Program,"We thank U.

Trithorax group (trxG) and Polycomb group (PcG) gene products are part of an evolutionarily conserved chromatin remodelling system that activate or silence gene expression, respectively(2). Although PcG member Bmi1 has been shown to be required for postnatal neural stem cell self-renewal(3,4), the role of trxG genes remains unknown. Here we show that the trxG member Mll1 (mixed-lineage leukaemia 1) is required for neurogenesis in the mouse postnatal brain. Mll1-deficient subventricular zone neural stem cells survive, proliferate and efficiently differentiate into glial lineages; however, neuronal differentiation is severely impaired. In Mll1-deficient cells, early proneural Mash1 (also known as Ascl1) and gliogenic Olig2 expression are preserved, but Dlx2, a key downstream regulator of subventricular zone neurogenesis, is not expressed. Overexpression of Dlx2 can rescue neurogenesis in Mll1-deficient cells. Chromatin immunoprecipitation demonstrates that Dlx2 is a direct target of MLL in subventricular zone cells. In differentiating wild-type subventricular zone cells, Mash1, Olig2 and Dlx2 loci have high levels of histone 3 trimethylated at lysine 4 (H3K4me3), consistent with their transcription. In contrast, in Mll1-deficient subventricular zone cells, chromatin at Dlx2 is bivalently marked by both H3K4me3 and histone 3 trimethylated at lysine 27 (H3K27me3), and the Dlx2 gene fails to properly activate. These data support a model in which Mll1 is required to resolve key silenced bivalent loci in postnatal neural precursors to the actively transcribed state for the induction of neurogenesis, but not for gliogenesis.","[Lim, Daniel A.; Huang, Yin-Cheng; Alvarez-Buylla, Arturo] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Neurol Surg, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; [Lim, Daniel A.; Huang, Yin-Cheng; Alvarez-Buylla, Arturo] Univ Calif San Francisco, Inst Regenerat Med, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; [Lim, Daniel A.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Vet Affairs Med Ctr, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; [Swigut, Tomek; Wysocka, Joanna] Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Dept Dev Biol, Dept Chem & Syst Biol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Mirick, Anika L.; Ernst, Patricia] Dartmouth Med Sch, Dept Genet, Hanover, NH 03755 USA; [Manuel Garcia-Verdugo, Jose] Univ Valencia, Inst Cavanilles, Lab Neurobiol Comparada, Valencia 46012, Spain; [Manuel Garcia-Verdugo, Jose] CIBERNED, Ctr Invest Principe Felipe, Lab Morfol Celular, Valencia 46012, Spain","Lim, DA (reprint author), Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Neurol Surg, 505 Parnassus St M779, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA.",limd@neurosurg.ucsf.edu; abuylla@stemcell.ucsf.edu,"Garcia-Verdugo, Jose Manuel/L-8421-2017","Garcia-Verdugo, Jose Manuel/0000-0001-9872-6499; Lim, Daniel/0000-0001-7221-3425","Neurosurgery Research and Education Foundation/American Association of Neurological Surgeons; Sandler Family Foundation; Northern California Institute for Research and Education; Clinical and Translational Research Institute at the University of California, San Francisco; California Institute for Regenerative Medicine New Faculty Award; Chicago Community Trust Searle Scholar Award; Goldhirsch Foundation; J.

The end result is over 4,000,000 smoking-related deaths annually worldwide and the largest source of preventable mortality in developed countries. Stress reduction, pleasure, improved cognition and other central nervous system effects are strongly associated with smoking. However, if nicotine activated ACh receptors found in muscle as potently as it does brain ACh receptors, smoking would cause intolerable and perhaps fatal muscle contractions. Despite extensive pharmacological, functional and structural studies of ACh receptors, the basis for the differential action of nicotine on brain compared with muscle ACh receptors has not been determined. Here we show that at the alpha 4 beta 2 brain receptors thought to underlie nicotine addiction, the high affinity for nicotine is the result of a strong cation-pi interaction to a specific aromatic amino acid of the receptor, TrpB. In contrast, the low affinity for nicotine at the muscle-type ACh receptor is largely due to the fact that this key interaction is absent, even though the immediate binding site residues, including the key amino acid TrpB, are identical in the brain and muscle receptors. At the same time a hydrogen bond from nicotine to the backbone carbonyl of TrpB is enhanced in the neuronal receptor relative to the muscle type. A point mutation near TrpB that differentiates alpha 4 beta 2 and muscle-type receptors seems to influence the shape of the binding site, allowing nicotine to interact more strongly with TrpB in the neuronal receptor. ACh receptors are established therapeutic targets for Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia, Parkinson's disease, smoking cessation, pain, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, epilepsy, autism and depression(1). Along with solving a chemical mystery in nicotine addiction, our results provide guidance for efforts to develop drugs that target specific types of nicotinic receptors.","[Xiu, Xinan; Puskar, Nyssa L.; Shanata, Jai A.

Induction of LTP and associated spine enlargement in single spines triggered transient (similar to 1 min) CaMKII activation restricted to the stimulated spines. CaMKII in spines was specifically activated by NMDA receptors and L-type voltage-sensitive calcium channels, presumably by nanodomain Ca(2+) near the channels, in response to glutamate uncaging and depolarization, respectively.

Here we introduce this method with the design of an oxygen transport protein, akin to human neuroglobin. Beginning with a simple and unnatural helix-forming sequence with just three different amino acids, we assembled a four-helix bundle, positioned histidines to bis-histidine ligate haems, and exploited helical rotation and glutamate burial on haem binding to introduce distal histidine strain and facilitate O-2 binding. For stable oxygen binding without haem oxidation, water is excluded by simple packing of the protein interior and loops that reduce helical-interface mobility. O-2 affinities and exchange timescales match natural globins with distal histidines, with the remarkable exception that O-2 binds tighter than CO.","[Koder, Ronald L.; Anderson, J. L.

Because of this intrinsic link to molecular structure, the determination of optical activity through circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy has long served as a routine method for obtaining structural information about chemical and biological systems in condensed phases(4-6). A recent development is time-resolved CD spectroscopy, which can in principle map the structural changes associated with biomolecular function(7) and thus lead to mechanistic insights into fundamental biological processes. But implementing time-resolved CD measurements is experimentally challenging because CD is a notoriously weak effect (a factor of 10(-4)-10(-6) smaller than absorption). In fact, this problem has so far prevented time-resolved vibrational CD experiments. Here we show that vibrational CD spectroscopy with femtosecond time resolution can be realized when using heterodyned spectral interferometry to detect(8-10) the phase and amplitude of the infrared optical activity free-induction-decay field in time (much like in a pulsed NMR experiment). We show that we can detect extremely weak signals in the presence of large achiral background contributions, by simultaneously measuring with a femtosecond laser pulse the vibrational CD and optical rotatory dispersion spectra of dissolved chiral limonene molecules. We have so far only targeted molecules in equilibrium, but it would be straightforward to extend the method for the observation of ultrafast structural changes such as those occurring during protein folding or asymmetric chemical reactions. That is, we should now be in a position to produce 'molecular motion pictures'(11) of fundamental molecular processes from a chiral perspective.","[Rhee, Hanju; June, Young-Gun; Lee, Jang-Soo; Lee, Kyung-Koo; Kim, Zee Hwan; Jeon, Seung-Joon; Cho, Minhaeng] Korea Univ, Dept Chem, Seoul 136701, South Korea; [Rhee, Hanju; Lee, Jang-Soo; Lee, Kyung-Koo; Cho, Minhaeng] Korea Univ, Ctr Multidimens Spect, Seoul 136701, South Korea; [Ha, Jeong-Hyon; Jeon, Seung-Joon; Cho, Minhaeng] Korea Basic Sci Inst, Multidimens Spect Lab, Seoul 136713, South Korea","Cho, MH (reprint author), Korea Univ, Dept Chem, Seoul 136701, South Korea.",mcho@korea.ac.kr,"Kim, Zee Hwan/A-9273-2010",,Creative Research Initiatives of MEST/KOSEF; Frontier Research Laboratory Program of KBSI,This work was supported by Creative Research Initiatives (CMDS) of MEST/KOSEF ( M.

The varied electronic configurations and bonding patterns of inorganic elements, on the other hand, can impart diverse electronic, magnetic, catalytic and other useful properties to molecular-level structures. Some hybrid organic-inorganic materials that combine features of both chemistries have been developed, most notably metal-organic frameworks(1), dense and extended organic inorganic frameworks(2) and coordination polymers(3). Metal ions have also been incorporated into molecules that contain interlocked subunits, such as rotaxanes(4-7) and catenanes(6,8), and structures in which many inorganic clusters encircle polymer chains have been described(9). Here we report the synthesis of a series of discrete rotaxane molecules in which inorganic and organic structural units are linked together mechanically at the molecular level. Structural units (dialkyammonium groups) in dumb-bell-shaped organic molecules template the assembly of essentially inorganic 'rings' about 'axles' to form rotaxanes consisting of various numbers of rings and axles. One of the rotaxanes behaves as a 'molecular shuttle'(10): the ring moves between two binding sites on the axle in a large-amplitude motion typical of some synthetic molecular machine systems(11-15). The architecture of the rotaxanes ensures that the electronic, magnetic and paramagnetic characteristics of the inorganic rings-properties that could make them suitable as qubits for quantum computers(16-18)-can influence, and potentially be influenced by, the organic portion of the molecule.","[Lee, Chin-Fa; Leigh, David A.; Schultz, David] Univ Edinburgh, Sch Chem, Edinburgh EH9 3JJ, Midlothian, Scotland; [Pritchard, Robin G.; Timco, Grigore A.; Winpenny, Richard E.

The governing physical properties are thermal diffusivity (kappa) and conductivity (k=kappa rho C-P), where rho denotes density and C-P denotes specific heat capacity at constant pressure. Although for crustal rocks both kappa and k decrease above ambient temperature(4,5), most thermal models of the Earth's lithosphere assume constant values for kappa (similar to 1 mm(2) s(-1)) and/or k (similar to 3 to 5 W m(-1) K-1)(6,7) owing to the large experimental uncertainties associated with conventional contact methods at high temperatures. Recent advances in laser-flash analysis(8,9) permit accurate (+/- 2 per cent) measurements on minerals and rocks to geologically relevant temperatures(10). Here we provide data from laser-flash analysis for three different crustal rock types, showing that kappa strongly decreases from 1.5-2.5 mm(2) s(-1) at ambient conditions, approaching 0.5 mm(2) s(-1) at mid-crustal temperatures. The latter value is approximately half that commonly assumed, and hot middle to lower crust is therefore a much more effective thermal insulator than previously thought. Above the quartz alpha-beta phase transition, crustal kappa is nearly independent of temperature, and similar to that of mantle materials(11). Calculated values of k indicate that its negative dependence on temperature is smaller than that of kappa, owing to the increase of C-P with increasing temperature, but k also diminishes by 50 per cent from the surface to the quartz alpha-beta transition. We present models of lithospheric thermal evolution during continental collision and demonstrate that the temperature dependence of kappa and C-P leads to positive feedback between strain heating in shear zones and more efficient thermal insulation, removing the requirement for unusually high radiogenic heat production to achieve crustal melting temperatures. Positive feedback between heating, increased thermal insulation and partial melting is predicted to occur in many tectonic settings, and in both the crust and the mantle, facilitating crustal reworking and planetary differentiation(12).","[Whittington, Alan G.; Nabelek, Peter I.] Univ Missouri, Dept Geol Sci, Columbia, MO 65211 USA; [Hofmeister, Anne M.] Washington Univ, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, St Louis, MO 63130 USA","Whittington, AG (reprint author), Univ Missouri, Dept Geol Sci, Columbia, MO 65211 USA.",whittingtona@missouri.edu,,"Whittington, Alan/0000-0003-2477-3043",US National Science Foundation,We thank M.

Furthermore, an understanding of the behaviour of the marine-based West Antarctic ice sheet (WAIS) during the 'warmer-than-present' early-Pliocene epoch (similar to 5-3 Myr ago) is needed to better constrain the possible range of ice-sheet behaviour in the context of future global warming(3). Here we present a marine glacial record from the upper 600 m of the AND-1B sediment core recovered from beneath the northwest part of the Ross ice shelf by the ANDRILL programme and demonstrate well-dated, similar to 40-kyr cyclic variations in ice-sheet extent linked to cycles in insolation influenced by changes in the Earth's axial tilt (obliquity) during the Pliocene. Our data provide direct evidence for orbitally induced oscillations in the WAIS, which periodically collapsed, resulting in a switch from grounded ice, or ice shelves, to open waters in the Ross embayment when planetary temperatures were up to similar to 3 degrees C warmer than today(4) and atmospheric CO2 concentration was as high as similar to 400 p. p. m. v. (refs 5, 6). The evidence is consistent with a new ice-sheet/ice-shelf model(7) that simulates fluctuations in Antarctic ice volume of up to +7 m in equivalent sea level associated with the loss of the WAIS and up to +3 m in equivalent sea level from the East Antarctic ice sheet, in response to ocean-induced melting paced by obliquity. During interglacial times, diatomaceous sediments indicate high surface-water productivity, minimal summer sea ice and air temperatures above freezing, suggesting an additional influence of surface melt(8) under conditions of elevated CO2.","[Naish, T.; Carter, L.; McKay, R.; Barrett, P.; Cody, R.; Dunbar, G.; Hannah, M.; Hansaraj, D.] Victoria Univ Wellington, Antarctic Res Ctr, Wellington 6012, New Zealand; [Naish, T.; Browne, G.; Cody, R.; Crampton, J.; Graham, I.; Hansaraj, D.; Henrys, S.; Raine, I.; Strong, P.] GNS Sci, Lower Hutt 5040, New Zealand; [Powell, R.; Scherer, R.; Vogel, S.] No Illinois Univ, Dept Geog & Environm Geosci, De Kalb, IL 60115 USA; [Levy, R.; Winter, D.; Reed, J.] Univ Nebraska, Dept Geosci, ANDRILL Sci Management Off, Lincoln, NE 68588 USA; [Wilson, G.; Ohneiser, C.] Univ Otago, Dept Geol, Dunedin 9001, Otago, New Zealand; [Talarico, F.] Univ Siena, Dipartimento Sci Terra, I-53100 Siena, Italy; [Krissek, L.; Wilson, T.; Millan, C.] Ohio State Univ, Dept Geol Sci, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Niessen, F.; Gebhardt, C.; Helling, D.; Kuhn, G.; Magens, D.] Alfred Wegener Inst Polar & Marine Res, Inst Geosci, D-27515 Bremerhaven, Germany; [Pompilio, M.] Ist Nazl Geofis & Vulcanol, I-56126 Pisa, Italy; [DeConto, R.] Univ Massachusetts, Dept Geosci, Morrell Sci Ctr 233, Amherst, MA 01003 USA; [Huybers, P.] Harvard Univ, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Pollard, D.] Penn State Univ, Earth & Environm Syst Inst, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Ross, J.; Dunbar, N.; Kyle, P.; McIntosh, W.] New Mexico Inst Min & Technol, Socorro, NM 87801 USA; [Cowan, E.] Appalachian State Univ, Dept Geol, Boone, NC 28608 USA; [Florindo, F.; Sagnotti, L.] Ist Nazl Geofis & Vulcanol, I-00143 Rome, Italy; [Hinnov, L.] Johns Hopkins Univ, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA; [Laeufer, A.] Fed Inst Geosci & Nat Resources, BGR, D-30655 Hannover, Germany; [Maffioli, P.] Univ Milano Bicocca, Dipartimento Sci Geol & Geotecnol, I-20126 Milan, Italy; [Mandernack, K.] Colorado Sch Mines, Dept Chem & Geochem, Golden, CO 80401 USA; [Morin, R.] US Geol Survey, Denver, CO 80225 USA; [Paulsen, T.] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Geol, Oshkosh, WI 54901 USA; [Persico, D.] Univ Parma, Dipartimento Sci Terra, I-43100 Parma, Italy; [Reed, J.] Iowa State Univ, CHRONOS, Dept Geol & Atmospher Sci, Ames, IA 50011 USA; [Riesselman, C.] Stanford Univ, Sch Earth Sci, Dept Geol & Environm Sci, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Schmitt, D.] Univ Alberta, Dept Phys, Edmonton, AB T6G 2G7, Canada; [Sjunneskog, C.] Louisiana State Univ, Dept Geol & Geophys, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA; [Taviani, M.] ISMAR Bologna, CNR, I-40129 Bologna, Italy; [Wilch, T.] Albion Coll, Dept Geol, Albion, MI 49224 USA; [Williams, T.] Columbia Univ, Lamont Doherty Earth Observ, Palisades, NY 10964 USA","Naish, T (reprint author), Victoria Univ Wellington, Antarctic Res Ctr, POB 600, Wellington 6012, New Zealand.",tim.naish@vuw.ac.nz,"Wilson, Gary/B-3803-2010; Levy, Richard/E-2477-2011; Crampton, James/G-1381-2012; Riesselman, Christina/H-5037-2012; Hinnov, Linda/D-9486-2013; Vogel, Stefan/I-1963-2014; CNR, Ismar/P-1247-2014; Hannah, Michael/H-1083-2015; McKay, Robert/N-2449-2015; Raine, James/D-5124-2009; Florindo, Fabio/F-4119-2010; Pompilio, Massimo/C-5892-2008; Schmitt, Douglas/A-4091-2010","Crampton, James/0000-0003-3270-9981; CNR, Ismar/0000-0001-5351-1486; Hannah, Michael/0000-0002-2275-0086; McKay, Robert/0000-0002-5602-6985; Raine, James/0000-0001-5294-2102; Florindo, Fabio/0000-0002-6058-9748; Pompilio, Massimo/0000-0002-0742-0679; Ohneiser, Christian/0000-0002-2781-2522; Naish, Tim/0000-0002-1185-9932; Schmitt, Douglas/0000-0001-6920-0658; talarico, franco/0000-0002-7254-4301; Vogel, Stefan/0000-0002-4350-7130; Riesselman, Christina/0000-0002-2436-4306; Sagnotti, Leonardo/0000-0003-3944-201X; taviani, marco/0000-0003-0414-4274; Gebhardt, Catalina/0000-0002-3227-0676; Kuhn, Gerhard/0000-0001-6069-7485",US National Science Foundation; New Zealand Foundation for Research Science and Technology; Royal Society of New Zealand Marsden Fund; Italian Antarctic Research Programme; German Research Foundation; Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research,"The ANDRILL project is a multinational collaboration between the Antarctic programmes of Germany, Italy, New Zealand and the United States.

Today, the ice sheet is fringed by vulnerable floating ice shelves that buttress the fast flow of inland ice streams. Grounding lines are several hundred metres below sea level and the bed deepens upstream, raising the prospect of runaway retreat(3,5). Projections of future WAIS behaviour have been hampered by limited understanding of past variations and their underlying forcing mechanisms(6,7). Its variation since the Last Glacial Maximum is best known, with grounding lines advancing to the continental-shelf edges around similar to 15 kyr ago before retreating to near-modern locations by similar to 3 kyr ago(8). Prior collapses during the warmth of the early Pliocene epoch(9) and some Pleistocene interglacials have been suggested indirectly from records of sea level and deep-sea-core isotopes, and by the discovery of open-ocean diatoms in subglacial sediments(10). Until now(11), however, little direct evidence of such behaviour has been available. Here we use a combined ice sheet/ice shelf model(12) capable of high-resolution nesting with a new treatment of grounding-line dynamics and ice-shelf buttressing 5 to simulate Antarctic ice sheet variations over the past five million years. Modelled WAIS variations range from full glacial extents with grounding lines near the continental shelf break, intermediate states similar to modern, and brief but dramatic retreats, leaving only small, isolated ice caps on West Antarctic islands. Transitions between glacial, intermediate and collapsed states are relatively rapid, taking one to several thousand years. Our simulation is in good agreement with a new sediment record (ANDRILL AND-1B) recovered from the western Ross Sea(11), indicating a long-term trend from more frequently collapsed to more glaciated states, dominant 40-kyr cyclicity in the Pliocene, and major retreats at marine isotope stage 31 (similar to 1.07 Myr ago) and other super-interglacials.","[Pollard, David] Penn State Univ, Earth & Environm Syst Inst, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [DeConto, Robert M.] Univ Massachusetts, Dept Geosci, Amherst, MA 01003 USA","Pollard, D (reprint author), Penn State Univ, Earth & Environm Syst Inst, University Pk, PA 16802 USA.",pollard@essc.psu.edu,,,"US National Science Foundation [ATM-0513402/0513421, ANT-034248, ANT-0424589]","We thank T.

Heterodontosauridae is characterized by small, gracile bodies and a problematic phylogenetic position(1,2). Recent phylogenetic work indicates that it represents the most basal group of all well-known ornithischians(3). Previous heterodontosaurid records are mainly from the Early Jurassic period (205-190 million years ago) of Africa(1,3). Here we report a new heterodontosaurid, Tianyulong confuciusi gen. et sp. nov., from the Early Cretaceous period (144-99 million years ago) of western Liaoning Province, China. Tianyulong extends the geographical distribution of heterodontosaurids to Asia and confirms the clade's previously questionable temporal range extension into the Early Cretaceous period. More surprisingly, Tianyulong bears long, singular and unbranched filamentous integumentary (outer skin) structures. This represents the first confirmed report, to our knowledge, of filamentous integumentary structures in an ornithischian dinosaur.","[You, Hai-Lu] Chinese Acad Geol Sci, Inst Geol, Beijing 100037, Peoples R China; [Zheng, Xiao-Ting] Shandong Tianyu Museum Nat, Pingyi 273300, Shandong, Peoples R China; [Xu, Xing; Dong, Zhi-Ming] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Vertebrate Paleontol & Paleoanthropol, Beijing 100044, Peoples R China","You, HL (reprint author), Chinese Acad Geol Sci, Inst Geol, 26 Baiwanzhuang Rd, Beijing 100037, Peoples R China.",youhailu@gmail.com,,,National Natural Science Foundation of China [40672007]; Ministry of Science and Technology; Hundred Talents Project of the Ministry of Land and Resources of China,"We thank P.-J.

Although little is known about the natural and life histories of yeasts in the wild, there are an increasing number of studies looking at ecological and geographic distributions(3,4), population structure(5-8) and sexual versus asexual reproduction(9,10). Less well understood at the whole genome level are the evolutionary processes acting within populations and species that lead to adaptation to different environments, phenotypic differences and reproductive isolation. Here we present one- to fourfold or more coverage of the genome sequences of over seventy isolates of the baker's yeast S. cerevisiae and its closest relative, Saccharomyces paradoxus. We examine variation in gene content, single nucleotide polymorphisms, nucleotide insertions and deletions, copy numbers and transposable elements. We find that phenotypic variation broadly correlates with global genome-wide phylogenetic relationships. S. paradoxus populations are well delineated along geographic boundaries, whereas the variation among worldwide S. cerevisiae isolates shows less differentiation and is comparable to a single S. paradoxus population. Rather than one or two domestication events leading to the extant baker's yeasts, the population structure of S. cerevisiae consists of a few well-defined, geographically isolated lineages and many different mosaics of these lineages, supporting the idea that human influence provided the opportunity for cross-breeding and production of new combinations of pre-existing variations.","[Carter, David M.; Moses, Alan M.; Parts, Leopold; Jones, Matthew; Quail, Michael A.; Goodhead, Ian; Sims, Sarah; Smith, Frances; Durbin, Richard] Wellcome Trust Sanger Inst, Cambridge CB10 1HH, England; [Liti, Gianni; Barton, David B.

An important characteristic of these immune systems is their ability to act both locally at the site of infection and at distal uninfected locations(1-4). In insects, such as Drosophila melanogaster, RNA interference (RNAi) mediates antiviral immunity(5-7). However, the antiviral RNAi defence in flies seems to be a local, cell-autonomous process, as flies are thought to be unable to generate a systemic RNAi response(8). Here we show that a recently defined double-stranded RNA(dsRNA) uptake pathway(9) is essential for effective antiviral RNAi immunity in adult flies. Mutant flies defective in this dsRNA uptake pathway were hypersensitive to infection with Drosophila C virus and Sindbis virus. Mortality in dsRNA-uptake-defective flies was accompanied by 100-to 10(5)-fold increases in viral titres and higher levels of viral RNA. Furthermore, inoculating naked dsRNA into flies elicited a sequence-specific antiviral immune response that required an intact dsRNA uptake pathway. These findings suggest that spread of dsRNA to uninfected sites is essential for effective antiviral immunity. Notably, infection with green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged Sindbis virus suppressed expression of host-encoded GFP at a distal site. Thus, similar to protein-based immunity in vertebrates, the antiviral RNAi response in flies also relies on the systemic spread of a virus-specific immunity signal.","[Saleh, Maria-Carla; Tassetto, Michel; van Rij, Ronald P.; Andino, Raul] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Microbiol & Immunol, San Francisco, CA 94122 USA; [Goic, Bertsy; Gausson, Valerie; Berry, Bassam; Jacquier, Caroline; Antoniewski, Christophe] Inst Pasteur, F-75015 Paris, France; [Berry, Bassam; Jacquier, Caroline; Antoniewski, Christophe] CNRS, URA 2578, F-75015 Paris, France","Andino, R (reprint author), Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Microbiol & Immunol, San Francisco, CA 94122 USA.",raul.andino@ucsf.edu,"BERRY, Bassam/D-1666-2009; Van Rij, Ronald/I-7073-2012; Antoniewski, Christophe/G-4519-2011","Van Rij, Ronald/0000-0003-0221-4689; Antoniewski, Christophe/0000-0001-7709-2116; Saleh, Maria-Carla/0000-0001-8593-4117","NIH [AI40085, AI064738]; Institut Pasteur; CNRS; ANR; ARC","d We are grateful to members of the Andino and the O'Farrell laboratories for discussion, technical support and advice on fly work.

T-reg cell differentiation and function are guided by the transcription factor Foxp3, and their deficiency due to mutations in Foxp3 results in aggressive fatal autoimmune disease associated with sharply augmented T(H)1 and T(H)2 cytokine production(1-3). Recent studies suggested that Foxp3 regulates the bulk of the Foxp3-dependent transcriptional program indirectly through a set of transcriptional regulators serving as direct Foxp3 targets(4,5). Here we show that in mouse T-reg cells, high amounts of interferon regulatory factor-4 (IRF4), a transcription factor essential for T(H)2 effector cell differentiation, is dependent on Foxp3 expression. We proposed that IRF4 expression endows T-reg cells with the ability to suppress T(H)2 responses. Indeed, ablation of a conditional Irf4 allele in T-reg cells resulted in selective dysregulation of T(H)2 responses, IL4-dependent immunoglobulin isotype production, and tissue lesions with pronounced plasma cell infiltration, in contrast to the mononuclear-cell-dominated pathology typical of mice lacking T-reg cells. Our results indicate that T-reg cells use components of the transcriptional machinery, promoting a particular type of effector CD4(+) T cell differentiation, to efficiently restrain the corresponding type of the immune response.","[Zheng, Ye; Chaudhry, Ashutosh; Kas, Arnold; deRoos, Paul; Kim, Jeong M.; Chu, Tin-Tin; Rudensky, Alexander Y.] Univ Washington, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Zheng, Ye; Chaudhry, Ashutosh; Kas, Arnold; deRoos, Paul; Kim, Jeong M.; Chu, Tin-Tin; Rudensky, Alexander Y.] Univ Washington, Dept Immunol, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Treuting, Piper] Univ Washington, Dept Comparat Med, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Corcoran, Lynn] Royal Melbourne Hosp, Walter & Eliza Hall Inst Med Res, Div Immunol, Parkville, Vic 3050, Australia; [Klein, Ulf] Columbia Univ, Inst Canc Genet, New York, NY 10032 USA; [Klein, Ulf] Columbia Univ, Herbert Irving Comprehens Canc Ctr, New York, NY 10032 USA","Rudensky, AY (reprint author), Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Dept Immunol, New York, NY 10021 USA.",rudenska@mskcc.org,"Corcoran, Lynn/C-9316-2013; Zheng, Ye/G-4866-2015","Zheng, Ye/0000-0001-5012-4309; Chaudhry, Ashutosh/0000-0003-3379-5236",CRI-Irvington Institute; Howard Hughes Medical Institute; National Institutes of Health,"Acknowledgements We thank K.

However, there has been no convincing evidence of any particular molecule being the true attractant that actually controls the navigation of pollen tubes towards ovules. Emerging data indicate that two synergid cells on the side of the egg cell emit a diffusible, species-specific signal to attract the pollen tube at the last step of pollen tube guidance(1-3). Here we report that secreted, cysteine-rich polypeptides (CRPs) in a subgroup of defensin-like proteins are attractants derived from the synergid cells. We isolated synergid cells of Torenia fournieri, a unique plant with a protruding embryo sac, to identify transcripts encoding secreted proteins as candidate molecules for the chemoattractant(s). We found two CRPs, abundantly and predominantly expressed in the synergid cell, which are secreted to the surface of the egg apparatus. Moreover, they showed activity in vitro to attract competent pollen tubes of their own species and were named as LUREs. Injection of morpholino antisense oligomers against the LUREs impaired pollen tube attraction, supporting the finding that LUREs are the attractants derived from the synergid cells of T. fournieri.","[Okuda, Satohiro; Tsutsui, Hiroki; Shiina, Keiko; Takeuchi, Hidenori; Yui, Ryoko; Kasahara, Ryushiro D.; Hamamura, Yuki; Mizukami, Akane; Susaki, Daichi; Kawano, Nao; Sakakibara, Takashi; Namiki, Shoko; Kanaoka, Masahiro M.; Sasaki, Narie; Higashiyama, Tetsuya] Nagoya Univ, Grad Sch Sci, Div Biol Sci, Chikusa Ku, Aichi 4648602, Japan; [Sprunck, Stefanie; Dresselhaus, Thomas] Univ Regensburg, D-93053 Regensburg, Germany; [Itoh, Kie] Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Frontier Sci, Dept Integrated Biosci, Chiba 2778562, Japan; [Otsuka, Kurataka; Matsuzaki, Motomichi; Nozaki, Hisayoshi; Nakano, Akihiko] Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Sci, Dept Biol Sci, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo 1130033, Japan; [Kuroiwa, Tsuneyoshi] Rikkyo St Pauls Univ, Grad Sch Sci, Res Informat Ctr Extremophile, Tokyo 1718501, Japan; [Nakano, Akihiko] RIKEN, Adv Sci Inst, Mol Membrane Biol Lab, Wako, Saitama 3510198, Japan","Higashiyama, T (reprint author), Nagoya Univ, Grad Sch Sci, Div Biol Sci, Chikusa Ku, Furo Cho, Aichi 4648602, Japan.",higashi@bio.nagoya-u.ac.jp,"Nakano, Akihiko/C-6185-2009; Higashiyama, Tetsuya/C-2882-2012; KANAOKA, Masahiro/I-7192-2014; NOZAKI, HISAYOSHI/G-4926-2014; Nakano, Akihiko/G-4942-2014; Nakano, Akihiko/A-6420-2016; Matsuzaki, Motomichi/D-4043-2016","KANAOKA, Masahiro/0000-0003-4913-6278; Nakano, Akihiko/0000-0003-3635-548X; Nakano, Akihiko/0000-0003-3635-548X; Matsuzaki, Motomichi/0000-0001-5811-798X","Grant-in-Aid for Young Scientists (Start-up); Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology (MEXT), Japan [20870020]; Creative Scientific Research, MEXT, Japan [18GS0314-01]; Yamada Science Foundation, Japan; Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research (B), MEXT, Japan [19370017]; Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research on Priority Areas [18075004]; PRESTO project; Japan Science and Technology Agency, Japan","We thank T.

In living cells this organization is determined by multiple factors, including the action of chromatin remodellers(2), competition with site-specific DNA-binding proteins(3), and the DNA sequence preferences of the nucleosomes themselves(4-8). However, it has been difficult to estimate the relative importance of each of these mechanisms in vivo(7,9-11), because in vivo nucleosome maps reflect the combined action of all influencing factors. Here we determine the importance of nucleosome DNA sequence preferences experimentally by measuring the genome-wide occupancy of nucleosomes assembled on purified yeast genomic DNA. The resulting map, in which nucleosome occupancy is governed only by the intrinsic sequence preferences of nucleosomes, is similar to in vivo nucleosome maps generated in three different growth conditions. In vitro, nucleosome depletion is evident at many transcription factor binding sites and around gene start and end sites, indicating that nucleosome depletion at these sites in vivo is partly encoded in the genome. We confirm these results with a micrococcal nuclease-independent experiment that measures the relative affinity of nucleosomes for similar to 40,000 double-stranded 150-base-pair oligonucleotides. Using our in vitro data, we devise a computational model of nucleosome sequence preferences that is significantly correlated with in vivo nucleosome occupancy in Caenorhabditis elegans. Our results indicate that the intrinsic DNA sequence preferences of nucleosomes have a central role in determining the organization of nucleosomes in vivo.","[Moore, Irene K.; Fondufe-Mittendorf, Yvonne; Widom, Jonathan] Northwestern Univ, Dept Biochem Mol Biol & Cell Biol, Evanston, IL 60208 USA; [Kaplan, Noam; Field, Yair; Segal, Eran] Weizmann Inst Sci, Dept Comp Sci & Appl Math, IL-76100 Rehovot, Israel; [Segal, Eran] Weizmann Inst Sci, Dept Mol Cell Biol, IL-76100 Rehovot, Israel; [Gossett, Andrea J.; Lieb, Jason D.] Univ N Carolina, Dept Biol, Carolina Ctr Genome Sci, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA; [Gossett, Andrea J.; Lieb, Jason D.] Univ N Carolina, Lineberger Comprehens Canc Ctr, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA; [Tillo, Desiree; Hughes, Timothy R.] Univ Toronto, Dept Mol Genet, Toronto, ON M5S 1A8, Canada; [LeProust, Emily M.] Genom LSSU, Agilent Technol Inc, Santa Clara, CA 95051 USA; [Hughes, Timothy R.] Univ Toronto, Banting & Best Dept Med Res, Toronto, ON M5S 3E1, Canada; [Hughes, Timothy R.] Terrence Donnelly Ctr Cellular & Biomol Res, Toronto, ON M5S 3E1, Canada","Widom, J (reprint author), Northwestern Univ, Dept Biochem Mol Biol & Cell Biol, 2153 Sheridan Rd, Evanston, IL 60208 USA.",j-widom@northwestern.edu; eran.segal@weizmann.ac.il,"Kaplan, Noam/A-3544-2011","Kaplan, Noam/0000-0001-9940-1987; Gossett, Andrea/0000-0002-9471-3970; Segal, Eran/0000-0002-6859-1164",CIHR; NIH; European Research Council (ERC); NSERC; Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center; University Cancer Research Funds,"We thank H.

Hydrophobic compounds readily partition into regular membrane lipid bilayers(6), and their transport through an aqueous protein channel is energetically unfavourable(3). Alternative transport models involving acquisition from the lipid bilayer by lateral diffusion have been proposed for hydrophobic substrates(3,4,7-12). So far, all transport proteins for which a lateral diffusion mechanism has been proposed function as efflux pumps. Here we present the first example of a lateral diffusion mechanism for the uptake of hydrophobic substrates by the Escherichia coli outer membrane long-chain fatty acid transporter FadL. A FadL mutant in which a lateral opening in the barrel wall is constricted, but which is otherwise structurally identical to wild-type FadL, does not transport substrates. A crystal structure of FadL from Pseudomonas aeruginosa shows that the opening in the wall of the beta-barrel is conserved and delineates a long, hydrophobic tunnel that could mediate substrate passage from the extracellular environment, through the polar lipopolysaccharide layer and, by means of the lateral opening in the barrel wall, into the lipid bilayer from where the substrate can diffuse into the periplasm. Because FadL homologues are found in pathogenic and biodegrading bacteria, our results have implications for combating bacterial infections and bioremediating xenobiotics in the environment.","[Hearn, Elizabeth M.; Patel, Dimki R.; Lepore, Bryan W.; Indic, Mridhu; van den Berg, Bert] Univ Massachusetts, Sch Med, Program Mol Med, Worcester, MA 01605 USA","van den Berg, B (reprint author), Univ Massachusetts, Sch Med, Program Mol Med, Worcester, MA 01605 USA.",bert.vandenberg@umassmed.edu,,,National Insitutes of Health; NIH [1R01GM074824],We thank the personnel of the National Synchrotron Light Source (NSLS) beamlines X6A and X29 for beam time and beamline support.

The two neural subsets also differ in their central projections, feeding into neural pathways that are reminiscent of the vestibular and auditory pathways in our brain.

In the strong-coupling regime, quantum emitters in a microresonator absorb and spontaneously re-emit a photon many times before dissipation becomes effective, giving rise to mixed light-matter eigenmodes(1-12). Recent experiments(13) in semiconductor microcavities reached a new limit of ultrastrong coupling(14), where photon exchange occurs on timescales comparable to the oscillation period of light. In this limit, ultrafast modulation of the coupling strength has been suggested to lead to unconventional QED phenomena(14,15). Although sophisticated light-matter coupling has been achieved in all three spatial dimensions, control in the fourth dimension, time, is little developed. Here we use a quantum-well waveguide structure to optically tune light-matter interaction from weak to ultrastrong and turn on maximum coupling within less than one cycle of light. In this regime, a class of extremely non-adiabatic phenomena becomes observable.

Intuitively, this response is expected to be accompanied by an increase in the widths of the valence and conduction bands and hence a more pronounced free-electron-like behaviour. But at the densities that can now be achieved experimentally, compression can be so substantial that core electrons overlap. This effect dramatically alters electronic properties from those typically associated with simple free-electron metals such as lithium (Li; refs 1-3) and sodium (Na; refs 4, 5), leading in turn to structurally complex phases(6-8) and superconductivity with a high critical temperature(9-11). But the most intriguing prediction-that the seemingly simple metals Li (ref. 1) and Na (ref. 4) will transform under pressure into insulating states, owing to pairing of alkali atoms-has yet to be experimentally confirmed. Here we report experimental observations of a pressure-induced transformation of Na into an optically transparent phase at similar to 200 GPa (corresponding to 5.0-fold compression). Experimental and computational data identify the new phase as a wide bandgap dielectric with a six-coordinated, highly distorted double-hexagonal close-packed structure. We attribute the emergence of this dense insulating state not to atom pairing, but to p-d hybridizations of valence electrons and their repulsion by core electrons into the lattice interstices. We expect that such insulating states may also form in other elements and compounds when compression is sufficiently strong that atomic cores start to overlap strongly.","[Ma, Yanming; Xie, Yu] Jilin Univ, Natl Lab Superhard Mat, Changchun 130012, Peoples R China; [Ma, Yanming; Oganov, Artem R.; Lyakhov, Andriy O.] ETH, Dept Mat, Crystallog Lab, CH-8093 Zurich, Switzerland; [Eremets, Mikhail; Trojan, Ivan; Medvedev, Sergey] Max Planck Inst Chem, D-55020 Mainz, Germany; [Oganov, Artem R.] Moscow MV Lomonosov State Univ, Dept Geol, Moscow 119992, Russia; [Valle, Mario] Swiss Natl Supercomp Ctr CSCS, Data Anal & Visualizat Serv, CH-6928 Manno, Switzerland; [Prakapenka, Vitali] Univ Chicago, Consortium Adv Radiat Sources, Chicago, IL 60637 USA","Ma, YM (reprint author), Jilin Univ, Natl Lab Superhard Mat, Changchun 130012, Peoples R China.",mym@jlu.edu.cn,"Xie, Yu/E-5875-2011; Troyan, Ivan/F-7918-2014; Ma, Yanming/A-7297-2008; Medvedev, Sergey/A-9495-2015; Ma, Yanming/A-4982-2009; Oganov, Artem/A-1213-2008","Xie, Yu/0000-0002-7782-5428; Ma, Yanming/0000-0003-3711-0011; Oganov, Artem/0000-0001-7082-9728; Valle, Mario/0000-0002-6644-1533",,,,28,346,362,9,162,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,12-Mar,2009,458,7235,,,,,182,U3,,10.1038/nature07786,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,417EQ,WOS:000264059700038,19279632,No,Y,N,11/20/17

But lithium does not stay 'simple' under compression: rather than becoming more free-electron-like as pressure is increased, first-principles calculations(1,2) suggest that it transforms into a semi-metal or semiconductor. Experimentally, it has been shown that dense lithium adopts low-symmetry structures(3,4); there is also evidence that its resistivity increases with pressure(5-8). However, the electronic transport properties of lithium have so far not been directly monitored as a function of increasing static pressure. Here we report electrical resistance measurements on lithium in a diamond anvil cell up to pressures of 105 GPa, which reveal a significant increase in electrical resistivity and a change in its temperature dependence near 80 GPa. Our data thus provide unambiguous experimental evidence for a pressure-induced metal-to-semiconductor transition in a 'simple' metallic element.","[Matsuoka, Takahiro; Shimizu, Katsuya] Osaka Univ, Ctr Quantum Sci & Technol Extreme Condit, KYOKUGEN, Osaka 5608531, Japan","Matsuoka, T (reprint author), Osaka Univ, Ctr Quantum Sci & Technol Extreme Condit, KYOKUGEN, 1-3 Machikaneyama, Osaka 5608531, Japan.",matsuoka@djebel.mp.es.osaka-u.ac.jp,,,"Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research [19104009]; Global COE Program Core Research and Engineering of Advanced Materials-Interdisciplinary Education Center for Materials Science), MEXT, Japan; Grant-in-Aid for JSPS Fellows [19.52753]","We thank N.

However, before the earthquake, geodetic and geologic surveys measured little shortening across the range front(1-3), inspiring a vigorous debate about the process by which the topography of the mountain belt is produced and maintained. Two endmember models have been proposed: (1) brittle crustal thickening, in which thrust faults with large amounts of slip that are rooted in the lithosphere cause uplift(4), and (2) crustal flow, in which low-viscosity material in the lower crust extrudes outward from the Tibetan plateau and inflates the crust north and east of the Himalayas(5-7). Here we use balanced geologic cross-sections to show that crustal shortening, structural relief, and topography are strongly correlated in the range front. This suggests that crustal shortening is a primary driver for uplift and topography of the Longmen Shan on the flanks of the plateau. The 2008 Wenchuan (M = 7.9) earthquake, which ruptured a large thrust fault along the range front causing tens of thousands of fatalities and widespread damage, is an active manifestation of this shortening process.","[Hubbard, Judith; Shaw, John H.] Harvard Univ, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA","Hubbard, J (reprint author), Harvard Univ, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, 20 Oxford St, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",jhubbard@fas.harvard.edu,"Hubbard, Judith/H-2837-2012","Hubbard, Judith/0000-0002-9980-1654",,,,20,260,318,7,63,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,12-Mar,2009,458,7235,,,,,194,197,,10.1038/nature07837,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,417EQ,WOS:000264059700041,19279635,No,Y,N,11/20/17

This study marks the first radioisotopic dating of any early hominin site in China beyond the range of mass spectrometric U-series dating. The weighted mean of six meaningful age measurements, 0.77 +/- 0.08 million years (Myr, mean +/- s.e.m.), provides the best age estimate for lower cultural layers 7-10. Together with previously reported U-series dating of speleothem calcite(3) and palaeomagnetic stratigraphy(4), as well as sedimentological considerations(8,9), these layers may be further correlated to S6-S7 in Chinese loess stratigraphy or marine isotope stages (MIS) 17-19, in the range of similar to 0.68 to 0.78 Myr ago.

We show that Drosophila melanogaster, like wild-caught Drosophila strains(4), exhibits robust wind-induced suppression of locomotion in response to air currents delivered at speeds normally encountered in nature(1,2). Here we identify wind-sensitive neurons in Johnston's organ, an antennal mechanosensory structure previously implicated in near-field sound detection (reviewed in refs 5 and 6). Using enhancer trap lines targeted to different subsets of Johnston's organ neurons(7), and a genetically encoded calcium indicator(8), we show that wind and near-field sound (courtship song) activate distinct populations of Johnston's organ neurons, which project to different regions of the antennal and mechanosensory motor centre in the central brain. Selective genetic ablation of wind-sensitive Johnston's organ neurons in the antenna abolishes wind-induced suppression of locomotion behaviour, without impairing hearing. Moreover, different neuronal subsets within the wind-sensitive population respond to different directions of arista deflection caused by air flow and project to different regions of the antennal and mechanosensory motor centre, providing a rudimentary map of wind direction in the brain. Importantly, sound- and wind-sensitive Johnston's organ neurons exhibit different intrinsic response properties: the former are phasically activated by small, bi-directional, displacements of the aristae, whereas the latter are tonically activated by unidirectional, static deflections of larger magnitude. These different intrinsic properties are well suited to the detection of oscillatory pulses of near-field sound and laminar air flow, respectively. These data identify wind-sensitive neurons in Johnston's organ, a structure that has been primarily associated with hearing, and reveal how the brain can distinguish different types of air particle movements using a common sensory organ.","[Yorozu, Suzuko; Wong, Allan; Fischer, Brian J.; Dankert, Heiko; Anderson, David J.] CALTECH, Div Biol 216 76, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA; [Yorozu, Suzuko; Wong, Allan; Anderson, David J.] CALTECH, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA; [Dankert, Heiko] CALTECH, Div Engn & Appl Sci 136 93, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA; [Kernan, Maurice J.] SUNY Stony Brook, Dept Neurobiol & Behav, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA; [Kamikouchi, Azusa; Ito, Kei] Univ Tokyo, Inst Mol & Cellular Biosci, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo 1130032, Japan; [Kamikouchi, Azusa] Univ Cologne, Inst Zool, Sensory Syst Lab, D-50923 Cologne, Germany","Anderson, DJ (reprint author), CALTECH, Div Biol 216 76, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA.",yorozu@caltech.edu; mancusog@caltech.edu,"Marion-Poll, Frederic/D-8882-2011","Marion-Poll, Frederic/0000-0001-6824-0180; Kernan, Maurice/0000-0002-1546-6159; Dankert, Heiko/0000-0002-0096-8455",NSF [EF-0623527],"We thank U.

As such, immune modulatory therapies that enhance and/or restore the function of virus-specific immunity may protect from disease progression. Here we investigate the safety and immune restoration potential of blockade of the co-inhibitory receptor programmed death 1 (PD-1) 4,5 during chronic simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) infection in macaques. We demonstrate that PD-1 blockade using an antibody to PD-1 is well tolerated and results in rapid expansion of virus-specific CD8 T cells with improved functional quality. This enhanced T-cell immunity was seen in the blood and also in the gut, a major reservoir of SIV infection. PD-1 blockade also resulted in proliferation of memory B cells and increases in SIV envelope-specific antibody. These improved immune responses were associated with significant reductions in plasma viral load and also prolonged the survival of SIV-infected macaques. Blockade was effective during the early (week 10) as well as late (similar to week 90) phases of chronic infection even under conditions of severe lymphopenia. These results demonstrate enhancement of both cellular and humoral immune responses during a pathogenic immunodeficiency virus infection by blocking a single inhibitory pathway and identify a novel therapeutic approach for control of human immunodeficiency virus infections.","[Velu, Vijayakumar; Titanji, Kehmia; Husain, Sajid; Pladevega, Annette; Lai, Lilin; Chennareddi, Lakshmi; Ahmed, Rafi; Amara, Rama Rao] Emory Univ, Sch Med, Emory Vaccine Ctr, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA; [Velu, Vijayakumar; Titanji, Kehmia; Husain, Sajid; Pladevega, Annette; Lai, Lilin; Chennareddi, Lakshmi; Amara, Rama Rao] Emory Univ, Div Microbiol & Immunol, Yerkes Natl Primate Res Ctr, Atlanta, GA 30329 USA; [Zhu, Baogong; Freeman, Gordon J.] Dana Farber Canc Inst, Dept Med Oncol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Zhu, Baogong; Freeman, Gordon J.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Med, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Vanderford, Thomas H.; Silvestri, Guido] Univ Penn, Sch Med, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA","Amara, RR (reprint author), Emory Univ, Sch Med, Emory Vaccine Ctr, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA.",ramara@emory.edu,,"Velu, Vijayakumar/0000-0003-4238-1924","NCRR NIH HHS [P51 RR000165, P51 RR00165, R24 RR016038, R24 RR16038]; NIAID NIH HHS [R01 AI057029, P30 AI050409, R01 AI057029-01, R01 AI057029-02, R01 AI057029-03, R01 AI057029-04, R01 AI057029-05, R01 AI071852, R01 AI074417, R01 AI074417-01A1, R01 AI074417-02]",,,30,321,342,2,22,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,12-Mar,2009,458,7235,,,,,206,U5,,10.1038/nature07662,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,417EQ,WOS:000264059700044,19078956,No,Y,N,11/20/17

The pool of naive T-cell clones is diverse and contains cells bearing T-cell antigen receptors (TCRs) that differ in their affinity for the same antigen(4,5). How these differences in affinity affect the function and the response kinetics of individual T-cell clones was previously unknown. Here we show that during the in vivo response to microbial infection, even very weak TCR-ligand interactions are sufficient to activate naive T cells, induce rapid initial proliferation and generate effector and memory cells. The strength of the TCR ligand interaction critically affects when expansion stops, when the cells exit lymphoid organs and when contraction begins; that is, strongly stimulated T cells contract and exit lymphoid organs later than weakly stimulated cells. Our data challenge the prevailing view that strong TCR ligation is a prerequisite for CD8(+) T-cell activation. Instead, very weak interactions are sufficient for activation, but strong TCR ligation is required to sustain T-cell expansion. We propose that in response to microbial challenge, T-cell clones with a broad range of avidities for foreign ligands are initially recruited, and that the pool of T cells subsequently matures in affinity owing to the more prolonged expansion of high-affinity T-cell clones.","[Zehn, Dietmar; Lee, Sarah Y.; Bevan, Michael J.] Univ Washington, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Dept Immunol, Seattle, WA 98195 USA","Bevan, MJ (reprint author), Univ Washington, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Dept Immunol, Box 357370, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.",mbevan@u.washington.edu,,,National Institutes of Health; Howard Hughes Medical Institute; Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation; German Research Foundation,"We thank A.

Often, symbionts must be acquired from the environment during each generation, and identification of the relevant symbiotic partner against a myriad of unwanted relationships is a formidable task(4). Although examples of this specificity are well-documented, the genetic mechanisms governing it are poorly characterized(5). Here we show that the two-component sensor kinase RscS is necessary and sufficient for conferring efficient colonization of Euprymna scolopes squid by bioluminescent Vibrio fischeri from the North Pacific Ocean. In the squid symbiont V. fischeri ES114, RscS controls light-organ colonization by inducing the Syp exopolysaccharide, a mediator of biofilm formation during initial infection. A genome-level comparison revealed that rscS, although present in squid symbionts, is absent from the fish symbiont V. fischeri MJ11. We found that heterologous expression of RscS in strain MJ11 conferred the ability to colonize E. scolopes in a manner comparable to that of natural squid isolates. Furthermore, phylogenetic analyses support an important role for rscS in the evolution of the squid symbiosis. Our results demonstrate that a regulatory gene can alter the host range of animal-associated bacteria. We show that, by encoding a regulator and not an effector that interacts directly with the host, a single gene can contribute to the evolution of host specificity by switching 'on' pre-existing capabilities for interaction with animal tissue.","[Mandel, Mark J.; Wollenberg, Michael S.; Ruby, Edward G.] Univ Wisconsin, Sch Med & Publ Hlth, Dept Med Microbiol & Immunol, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Stabb, Eric V.] Univ Georgia, Dept Microbiol, Athens, GA 30602 USA; [Visick, Karen L.] Loyola Univ Chicago, Dept Microbiol & Immunol, Maywood, IL 60153 USA","Mandel, MJ (reprint author), Univ Wisconsin, Sch Med & Publ Hlth, Dept Med Microbiol & Immunol, 1550 Linden Dr, Madison, WI 53706 USA.",mmandel@wisc.edu,,"Mandel, Mark/0000-0001-6506-6711",Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation Marine Microbial Genome Sequencing Project; National Institutes of Health - National Center for Research Resources; National Science Foundation Division of Integrative Organismal Systems; National Science Foundation CAREER Award; National Institute of General Medical Sciences; National Institute of General Medical Sciences National Research Service Award Postdoctoral Fellowship; National Science Foundation Predoctoral Fellowship and a National Institutes of Health Molecular Biosciences Training,"We thank: P.

The logic behind this phenomenon is that chromosome condensation prevents the activity of RNA polymerases. In budding yeast, however, transcription was proposed to be continuous during mitosis(2). Here we show that Cdc14, a protein phosphatase required for nucleolar segregation(3) and mitotic exit(4), inhibits transcription of yeast ribosomal genes (rDNA) during anaphase. The phosphatase activity of Cdc14 is required for RNA polymerase I (Pol I) inhibition in vitro and in vivo. Moreover Cdc14-dependent inhibition involves nucleolar exclusion of Pol I subunits. We demonstrate that transcription inhibition is necessary for complete chromosome disjunction, because ribosomal RNA (rRNA) transcripts block condensin binding to rDNA, and show that bypassing the role of Cdc14 in nucleolar segregation requires in vivo degradation of nascent transcripts. Our results show that transcription interferes with chromosome condensation, not the reverse. We conclude that budding yeast, like most eukaryotes, inhibit Pol I transcription before segregation as a prerequisite for chromosome condensation and faithful genome separation.","[Clemente-Blanco, Andres; Mayan-Santos, Maria; Machin, Felix; Jarmuz, Adam; Aragon, Luis] Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, MRC, Ctr Clin Sci, Cell Cycle Grp, London W12 0NN, England; [Schneider, David A.] Univ Alabama, Dept Biochem & Mol Genet, Birmingham, AL 35294 USA; [Tschochner, Herbert] Univ Regensburg, Inst Biochem Mikrobiol & Genet, Munich, Germany","Aragon, L (reprint author), Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, MRC, Ctr Clin Sci, Cell Cycle Grp, Du Cane Rd, London W12 0NN, England.",luis.aragon@csc.mrc.ac.uk,"Clemente Blanco, Andres/D-4255-2014; Machin, Felix/K-6569-2017","Clemente Blanco, Andres/0000-0002-3674-0671; Machin, Felix/0000-0003-4559-7798; Schneider, David/0000-0003-0635-5091",Medical Research Council of the UK; UAB HSF-GEF; La Junta de Extremadura,"We are grateful to A.

However, the functional significance of these transcripts has been particularly controversial. Although there are some well-characterized examples, most (>95%) show little evidence of evolutionary conservation and have been suggested to represent transcriptional noise(5,6). Here we report a new approach to identifying large non-coding RNAs using chromatin-state maps to discover discrete transcriptional units intervening known protein-coding loci. Our approach identified similar to 1,600 large multi-exonic RNAs across four mouse cell types. In sharp contrast to previous collections, these large intervening non-coding RNAs (lincRNAs) show strong purifying selection in their genomic loci, exonic sequences and promoter regions, with greater than 95% showing clear evolutionary conservation. We also developed a functional genomics approach that assigns putative functions to each lincRNA, demonstrating a diverse range of roles for lincRNAs in processes from embryonic stem cell pluripotency to cell proliferation. We obtained independent functional validation for the predictions for over 100 lincRNAs, using cell-based assays. In particular, we demonstrate that specific lincRNAs are transcriptionally regulated by key transcription factors in these processes such as p53, NF kappa B, Sox2, Oct4 (also known as Pou5f1) and Nanog. Together, these results define a unique collection of functional lincRNAs that are highly conserved and implicated in diverse biological processes.","[Guttman, Mitchell; Amit, Ido; Garber, Manuel; French, Courtney; Lin, Michael F.; Huarte, Maite; Zuk, Or; Mikkelsen, Tarjei S.; Hacohen, Nir; Bernstein, Bradley E.; Kellis, Manolis; Regev, Aviv; Rinn, John L.; Lander, Eric S.] MIT & Harvard, Broad Inst, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; [Guttman, Mitchell; Carey, Bryce W.; Cassady, John P.; Jaenisch, Rudolf; Jacks, Tyler; Regev, Aviv; Lander, Eric S.] MIT, Dept Biol, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Feldser, David; Jacks, Tyler] MIT, Koch Inst Integrat Canc Res, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Mikkelsen, Tarjei S.] MIT, Div Hlth Sci & Technol, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Kellis, Manolis] MIT, Comp Sci & Artificial Intelligence Lab, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Huarte, Maite; Rinn, John L.] Beth Israel Deaconess Med Ctr, Dept Pathol, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Cabili, Moran N.; Lander, Eric S.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Syst Biol, Boston, MA 02114 USA; [Carey, Bryce W.; Cassady, John P.; Jaenisch, Rudolf; Lander, Eric S.] Whitehead Inst Biomed Res, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; [Hacohen, Nir] Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Ctr Immunol & Inflammatory Dis, Charlestown, MA 02129 USA; [Bernstein, Bradley E.] Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Mol Pathol Unit, Charlestown, MA 02129 USA; [Bernstein, Bradley E.] Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Ctr Canc Res, Charlestown, MA 02129 USA; [Bernstein, Bradley E.; Rinn, John L.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Pathol, Boston, MA 02115 USA","Rinn, JL (reprint author), MIT & Harvard, Broad Inst, 7 Cambridge Ctr, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA.",jrinn@broad.mit.edu,"Phelps, Steve/H-2263-2011; Mikkelsen, Tarjei/A-1306-2007; Huarte, Maite/J-6903-2014","Mikkelsen, Tarjei/0000-0002-8133-3135; Huarte, Maite/0000-0003-3753-6493",Human Frontier Science Program Organization; Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center; National Human Genome Research Institute; Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard,"We would like to thank our colleagues at the Broad Institute, especially J.

Although UBLs achieve this conjugation through an intricate enzymatic cascade, their bacterial counterparts MoaD and ThiS function as sulphur carrier proteins(2,3). Here we show that Urm1p, the most ancient UBL3, acts as a sulphur carrier in the process of eukaryotic transfer RNA ( tRNA) modification, providing a possible evolutionary link between UBL and sulphur transfer. Moreover, we identify Uba4p, Ncs2p, Ncs6p and Yor251cp as components of this conserved pathway. Using in vitro assays, we show that Ncs6p binds to tRNA, whereas Uba4p first adenylates and then directly transfers sulphur onto Urm1p. Finally, functional analysis reveals that the thiolation function of Urm1p is critical to regulate cellular responses to nutrient starvation and oxidative stress conditions, most likely by increasing translation fidelity.","[Leidel, Sebastian; Pedrioli, Patrick G.

Flavin mononucleotide (FMN)specific riboswitches(4,5), also known as RFN elements(6), direct expression of bacterial genes involved in the biosynthesis and transport of riboflavin (vitamin B(2)) and related compounds. Here we present the crystal structures of the Fusobacterium nucleatum riboswitch bound to FMN, riboflavin and antibiotic roseoflavin(7). The FMN riboswitch structure, centred on an FMN-bound six-stem junction, does not fold by collinear stacking of adjacent helices, typical for folding of large RNAs. Rather, it adopts a butterfly-like scaffold, stapled together by opposingly directed but nearly identically folded peripheral domains. FMN is positioned asymmetrically within the junctional site and is specifically bound to RNA through interactions with the isoalloxazine ring chromophore and direct and Mg(2+)-mediated contacts with the phosphate moiety. Our structural data, complemented by binding and footprinting experiments, imply a largely pre-folded tertiary RNA architecture and FMN recognition mediated by conformational transitions within the junctional binding pocket. The inherent plasticity of the FMN-binding pocket and the availability of large openings make the riboswitch an attractive target for structure-based design of FMN-like antimicrobial compounds. Our studies also explain the effects of spontaneous and antibiotic-induced deregulatory mutations and provided molecular insights into FMN-based control of gene expression in normal and riboflavin-overproducing bacterial strains.","[Serganov, Alexander; Huang, Lili; Patel, Dinshaw J.] Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Struct Biol Program, New York, NY 10065 USA","Serganov, A (reprint author), Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Struct Biol Program, New York, NY 10065 USA.",serganoa@mskcc.org; pateld@mskcc.org,,"Serganov, Alexander/0000-0001-8328-9310",the US Department of Energy; National Institutes of Health,"We thank the personnel of beamline X29 at the Brookhaven National Laboratory and beamline 24-ID-C at the Advanced Photon Source, Argonne National Laboratory, funded by the US Department of Energy.

Glycine betaine is bound in a tryptophan box occluded from both sides of the membrane with aromatic side chains lining the transport pathway. BetP has the same overall fold as three unrelated Na+-coupled symporters. Whereas these are crystallized in either the outward-facing or the inward-facing conformation, the BetP structure reveals a unique intermediate conformation in the Na+-coupled transport cycle.

This has resulted in unprecedented insights into the lattice dynamics of solids undergoing phase transitions. In aluminium, for example, femtosecond optical excitation hardly affects the potential energy surface of the lattice; instead, melting of the material is governed by the transfer of thermal energy between the excited electrons and the initially cold lattice(1). In semiconductors, in contrast, exciting similar to 10 per cent of the valence electrons results in non-thermal lattice collapse owing to the anti-bonding character of the conduction band(2-5,9,10). These different material responses raise the intriguing question of how Peierls-distorted systems(11) such as bismuth(12) will respond to strong excitations. The evolution of the atomic configuration of bismuth upon excitation of its A(1g) lattice mode, which involves damped oscillations of atoms along the direction of the Peierls distortion of the crystal, has been probed(6-8), but the actual melting of the material has not yet been investigated. Here we present a femtosecond electron diffraction study of the structural changes in crystalline bismuth as it undergoes laser-induced melting. We find that the dynamics of the phase transition depend strongly on the excitation intensity, with melting occurring within 190 fs ( that is, within half a period of the unperturbed A(1g) lattice mode(6-8)) at the highest excitation. We attribute the surprising speed of the melting process to laser-induced changes in the potential energy surface of the lattice, which result in strong acceleration of the atoms along the longitudinal direction of the lattice and efficient coupling of this motion to an unstable transverse vibrational mode.

Chemical doping is the conventional way of modulating these valence states. In ABO(3) perovskite and/or perovskite-like oxides, chemical doping at the A site can introduce holes or electrons at the B site, giving rise to exotic physical properties like high-transition-temperature superconductivity and colossal magneto-resistance(3,4). When valence-variable transition metals at two different atomic sites are involved simultaneously, we expect to be able to induce charge transfer-and, hence, valence changes by using a small external stimulus rather than by introducing a doping element. Materials showing this type of charge transfer are very rare, however, and such externally induced valence changes have been observed only under extreme conditions like high pressure(5,6). Here we report unusual temperature-induced valence changes at the A and B sites in the A-site-ordered double perovskite LaCu3Fe4O12; the underlying intersite charge transfer is accompanied by considerable changes in the material's structural, magnetic and transport properties. When cooled, the compound shows a first-order, reversible transition at 393 K from LaCu32+Fe43.75+O12 with Fe3.75+ ions at the B site to LaCu33+Fe43+O12 with rare Cu3+ ions at the A site. Intersite charge transfer between the A-site Cu and B-site Fe ions leads to paramagnetism-to-antiferromagnetism and metal-to-insulator isostructural phase transitions. What is more interesting in relation to technological applications is that this above-room-temperature transition is associated with a large negative thermal expansion.","[Long, Y.

Variations in rock strain during an earthquake are caused by heterogeneity in the elastic stress before the earthquake, by variable material properties and geometry of the fault zones, and by dynamic processes during the rupture(1,2). Stress changes due to the earthquake slip, both dynamic and static, have long been thought to cause dilatancy in the fault zone that recovers after the earthquake(3-5). Decreases in the velocity of seismic waves passing through the fault zone due to coseismic dilatancy have been observed(6) followed by postseismic seismic velocity increases during healing(5,7,8). Dilatancy and its recovery have not previously been observed geodetically. Here we use interferometric analysis of synthetic aperture radar images to measure postseismic surface deformation after the 2003 Bam, Iran, earthquake and show reversal of coseismic dilatancy in the shallow fault zone that causes subsidence of the surface. This compaction of the fault zone is directly above the patch of greatest coseismic slip at depth. The dilatancy and compaction probably reflects distributed shear and damage to the material during the earthquake that heals afterwards. Coseismic and postseismic deformation spread through a fault zone volume may resolve the paradox of shallow slip deficits for some strike-slip fault ruptures(9).","[Fielding, Eric J.; Lundgren, Paul R.] CALTECH, Jet Prop Lab, Pasadena, CA 91109 USA; [Buergmann, Roland] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Funning, Gareth J.] Univ Calif Riverside, Dept Earth Sci, Riverside, CA 92521 USA","Fielding, EJ (reprint author), CALTECH, Jet Prop Lab, 4800 Oak Grove Dr, Pasadena, CA 91109 USA.",Eric.J.Fielding@jpl.nasa.gov,"Funning, Gareth/F-6926-2011","Funning, Gareth/0000-0002-8247-0545; Fielding, Eric/0000-0002-6648-8067",AOE [668],"Envisat data are copyright 2004-07 European Space Agency and were provided under AOE project 668.

However, eukaryotic phytoplankton and cyanobacteria (that is, 'phytoplankton' collectively) have the ability to decrease their cellular phosphorus content when phosphorus in their environment is scarce(1,4,5). The biochemical mechanisms that allow phytoplankton to limit their phosphorus demand and still maintain growth are largely unknown. Here we show that phytoplankton, in regions of oligotrophic ocean where phosphate is scarce, reduce their cellular phosphorus requirements by substituting non-phosphorus membrane lipids for phospholipids. In the Sargasso Sea, where phosphate concentrations were less than 10 nmol l(-1), we found that only 1.3 +/- 0.6% of phosphate uptake was used for phospholipid synthesis; in contrast, in the South Pacific subtropical gyre, where phosphate was greater than 100 nmol l(-1), plankton used 17 +/- 6% (ref. 6). Examination of the planktonic membrane lipids at these two locations showed that classes of sulphur- and nitrogen-containing membrane lipids, which are devoid of phosphorus, were more abundant in the Sargasso Sea than in the South Pacific. Furthermore, these non-phosphorus, 'substitute lipids' were dominant in phosphorus-limited cultures of all of the phytoplankton species we examined. In contrast, the marine heterotrophic bacteria we examined contained no substitute lipids and only phospholipids. Thus heterotrophic bacteria, which compete with phytoplankton for nutrients in oligotrophic regions like the Sargasso Sea, appear to have a biochemical phosphorus requirement that phytoplankton avoid by using substitute lipids. Our results suggest that phospholipid substitutions are fundamental biochemical mechanisms that allow phytoplankton to maintain growth in the face of phosphorus limitation.","[Van Mooy, Benjamin A.

During sleep, brain regions are reactivated(5,6), and specific patterns of neural activity are replayed(7-10), consistent with patterns observed in previous waking behaviour. Birdsong learning is a paradigmatic model system for skill learning(11-14). Song development in juvenile zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata) is characterized by sleep-dependent circadian fluctuations in singing behaviour, with immediate post-sleep deterioration in song structure followed by recovery later in the day(15). In sleeping adult birds, spontaneous bursting activity of forebrain premotor neurons in the robust nucleus of the arcopallium (RA) carries information about daytime singing(16). Here we show that, in juvenile zebra finches, playback during the day of an adult 'tutor' song induced profound and tutor-song-specific changes in bursting activity of RA neurons during the following night of sleep. The night-time neuronal changes preceded tutor-song-induced changes in singing, first observed the following day. Interruption of auditory feedback greatly reduced sleep bursting and prevented the tutor-song-specific neuronal remodelling. Thus, night-time neuronal activity is shaped by the interaction of the song model (sensory template) and auditory feedback, with changes in night-time activity preceding the onset of practice associated with vocal learning. We hypothesize that night-time bursting induces adaptive changes in premotor networks during sleep as part of vocal learning. By this hypothesis, adaptive changes driven by replay of sensory information at night and by evaluation of sensory feedback during the day interact to produce the complex circadian patterns seen early in vocal development.","[Shank, Sylvan S.; Margoliash, Daniel] Univ Chicago, Dept Psychol, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Margoliash, Daniel] Univ Chicago, Dept Organismal Biol & Anat, Chicago, IL 60637 USA","Margoliash, D (reprint author), Univ Chicago, Dept Psychol, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.",dan@bigbird.uchicago.edu,,,"NIMH NIH HHS [R01 MH059831, R01 MH059831-09]",,,34,86,87,2,37,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,5-Mar,2009,458,7234,,,,,73,U4,,10.1038/nature07615,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,414AJ,WOS:000263836000035,19079238,No,,,11/20/17

Interleukin (IL)-17 producing T helper cells (T(H)17) are a recently identified subset, separate from the T helper type 1 (T(H)1) and T helper type 2 (T(H)2) subsets(1). Synergy between the cytokines transforming growth factor-beta and IL-6 in vitro induces development of TH17 cells in mouse(1-5) and human(6) systems, whereas IL-23 supports expansion of these cells(2,4,5). However, it is not known which conditions in vivo would induce this combination of cytokines. Furthermore, it is enigmatic that a combination of pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines would be required to generate an effector TH17 response. Here we show that the relevant physiological stimulus triggering this combination of cytokines is the recognition and phagocytosis of infected apoptotic cells by dendritic cells. Phagocytosis of infected apoptotic cells uniquely triggers the combination of IL-6 and transforming growth factor-beta through recognition of pathogen-associated molecular patterns(7) and phosphatidylserine exposed on apoptotic cells(8), respectively. Conversely, phagocytosis of apoptotic cells in the absence of microbial signals induces differentiation of the closely related regulatory T cells, which are important for controlling autoimmunity(9). Blocking apoptosis during infection of the mouse intestinal epithelium with the rodent pathogen Citrobacter rodentium(10), which models human infections with the attaching and effacing enteropathogenic and enterohaemorrhagic Escherichia coli, impairs the characteristic TH17 response in the lamina propria. Our results demonstrate that infected apoptotic cells are a critical component of the innate immune signals instructing TH17 differentiation, and point to pathogens particularly adept at triggering apoptosis that might preferentially induce T(H)17-mediated immunity. Because TH17 cells have been correlated with autoimmune diseases(1), investigation of the pathways of innate recognition of infected apoptotic cells might lead to improved understanding of the causative defects in autoimmunity.","[Torchinsky, Miriam Beer; Garaude, Johan; Martin, Andrea P.; Blander, J.

Our findings show that the strategy for antibiotic development based on FASII pathway targets is fundamentally flawed by the fact that exogenous fatty acids fully bypass inhibition of this pathway in both in vitro and in vivo conditions. We demonstrate that major Gram-positive pathogens-such as streptococci, pneumococci, enterococci and staphylococci-overcome drug-induced FASII pathway inhibition when supplied with exogenous fatty acids, and human serum proves to be a highly effective source of fatty acids. For opportunist pathogen Streptococcus agalactiae, growth in serum leads to an overall decrease of FASII gene expression. No antibiotic inhibitor could have a stronger effect than the inactivation of the target gene, so we challenged the role of FASII using deletion mutants. Our results unequivocally show that the FASII target enzymes are dispensable in vivo during S. agalactiae infection. The results of this study largely compromise the use of FASII-based antimicrobials for treating sepsis caused by Gram-positive pathogens.","[Brinster, Sophie; Poyart, Claire] Univ Paris 05, Inst Cochin, CNRS, UMR 8104, Paris, France; [Brinster, Sophie; Poyart, Claire] INSERM, U567, Paris, France; [Lamberet, Gilles; Gruss, Alexandra] INRA, Unite Bacteries Lact & Pathogenes Opportunistes, UR888, F-78350 Jouy En Josas, France; [Staels, Bart] Univ Lille 2, Inst Pasteur Lille, UMR545, Lille, France; [Trieu-Cuot, Patrick; Poyart, Claire] Inst Pasteur, CNRS, URA 2172, Unite Biol Bacteries Pathogenes Gram Posi, Paris, France; [Poyart, Claire] Hop Cochin, Ctr Natl Reference Streptocoques, AP HP, F-75674 Paris, France","Poyart, C (reprint author), Univ Paris 05, Inst Cochin, CNRS, UMR 8104, Paris, France.",Alexandra.gruss@jouy.inra.fr; claire.poyart@cch.aphp.fr,"POYART, Claire/P-4225-2017","POYART, Claire/0000-0003-2158-6293; Gruss, Alexandra/0000-0001-7426-5229; Staels, Bart/0000-0002-3784-1503; TRIEU-CUOT, Patrick/0000-0002-2768-9587",French Agence Nationale de la Recherche; INSERM; INRA; Universite Paris Descartes; Institut Pasteur; ANR StrepRespire Project,"We are grateful to I.

Unfortunately, many signalling networks are not amenable to such analysis, as they are frequently transient and dispersed. By contrast, the signalling pathways used by pathogens undergoing actin-based motility are highly localized and operate in a constitutive fashion(1-5). Taking advantage of this, we have analysed the dynamics of neuronal Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (N-WASP), WASP-interacting protein (WIP), GRB2 and NCK, which are required to stimulate actin-related protein (ARP) 2/3-complex-dependent actin-based motility of vaccinia virus(6-9), using fluorescence recovery after photobleaching. Here we show that all four proteins are rapidly exchanging, albeit at different rates, and that the turnover of N-WASP depends on its ability to stimulate ARP2/3-complex-mediated actin polymerization. Conversely, disruption of the interaction of N-WASP with GRB2 and/or the barbed ends of actin filaments increases its exchange rate and results in a faster rate of virus movement. We suggest that the exchange rate of N-WASP controls the rate of ARP2/3-complex-dependent actin-based motility by regulating the extent of actin polymerization by antagonizing filament capping.","[Weisswange, Ina; Newsome, Timothy P.; Schleich, Sibylle; Way, Michael] London Res Inst, Canc Res UK, Cell Motil Lab, London WC2A 3PX, England","Way, M (reprint author), London Res Inst, Canc Res UK, Cell Motil Lab, 44 Lincolns Inn Fields, London WC2A 3PX, England.",michael.way@cancer.org.uk,,,Human Frontier Science Program (HFSP); Cancer Research UK,"We would like to thank T.

Antigen receptor stimulation assembles an NF-kappa B activating platform containing the scaffold protein CARMA1 (also called CARD11), the adaptor BCL10 and the paracaspase MALT1 (the CBM complex), linked to the inhibitor of NF-kappa B kinase complex(3-12), but signal transduction is not fully understood(1). We conducted parallel screens involving a mass spectrometry analysis of CARMA1 binding partners and an RNA interference screen for growth inhibition of the CBM-dependent 'activated B-cell-like' (ABC) subtype of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL)(12). Here we report that both screens identified casein kinase 1 alpha (CK1 alpha) as a bifunctional regulator of NF-kappa B. CK1 alpha dynamically associates with the CBM complex on T-cell-receptor (TCR) engagement to participate in cytokine production and lymphocyte proliferation. However, CK1 alpha kinase activity has a contrasting role by subsequently promoting the phosphorylation and inactivation of CARMA1. CK1 alpha has thus a dual 'gating' function which first promotes and then terminates receptor-induced NF-kappa B. ABCDLBCL cells required CK1 alpha for constitutive NF-kappa B activity, indicating that CK1 alpha functions as a conditionally essential malignancy gene-a member of a new class of potential cancer therapeutic targets.","[Bidere, Nicolas; Lee, Jeansun; Zheng, Lixin; Wan, Fengyi; Sakai, Keiko; Zhang, Jun; Lenardo, Michael J.] NIAID, Mol Dev Sect, Immunol Lab, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Ngo, Vu N.; Collins, Cailin; Davis, R.

Recent developments in NMR hardware and methodology have enabled the measurement of high-resolution heteronuclear multi-dimensional NMR spectra of macromolecules in living cells (in-cell NMR)(1-5). Various intracellular events such as conformational changes, dynamics and binding events have been investigated by this method. However, the low sensitivity and the short lifetime of the samples have so far prevented the acquisition of sufficient structural information to determine protein structures by in-cell NMR. Here we show the first, to our knowledge, 3D protein structure calculated exclusively on the basis of information obtained in living cells. The structure of the putative heavy-metal binding protein TTHA1718 from Thermus thermophilus HB8 overexpressed in Escherichia coli cells was solved by in-cell NMR. Rapid measurement of the 3D NMR spectra by nonlinear sampling of the indirectly acquired dimensions was used to overcome problems caused by the instability and low sensitivity of living E. coli samples. Almost all of the expected backbone NMR resonances and most of the side-chain NMR resonances were observed and assigned, enabling high quality (0.96 angstrom backbone root mean squared deviation) structures to be calculated that are very similar to the in vitro structure of TTHA1718 determined independently. The in-cell NMR approach can thus provide accurate high-resolution structures of proteins in living environments.","[Sakakibara, Daisuke; Sasaki, Atsuko; Ikeya, Teppei; Hamatsu, Junpei; Hanashima, Tomomi; Mishima, Masaki; Guentert, Peter; Ito, Yutaka] Tokyo Metropolitan Univ, Dept Chem, Tokyo 1920397, Japan; [Sakakibara, Daisuke; Sasaki, Atsuko; Hamatsu, Junpei; Mishima, Masaki; Shirakawa, Masahiro; Ito, Yutaka] Japan Sci & Technol Agcy, CREST, Kawaguchi, Saitama 3320012, Japan; [Ikeya, Teppei; Guentert, Peter] Univ Frankfurt, Inst Biophys Chem, D-60438 Frankfurt, Germany; [Ikeya, Teppei; Guentert, Peter] Univ Frankfurt, Ctr Biomol Magnet Resonance, D-60438 Frankfurt, Germany; [Yoshimasu, Masatoshi] RIKEN, Cellular & Mol Biol Lab, Wako, Saitama 3510198, Japan; [Hayashi, Nobuhiro] Fujita Hlth Univ, Inst Comprehens Med Sci, Div Biomed Polymer Sci, Toyoake, Aichi 4701192, Japan; [Mikawa, Tsutomu; Ito, Yutaka] RIKEN, Res Grp Biosupramol Struct Funct, Tsurumi Ku, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2300045, Japan; [Waelchli, Markus] Bruker BioSpin, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3050051, Japan; [Smith, Brian O.] Univ Glasgow, Fac Biomed & Life Sci, Div Mol & Cellular Biol, Glasgow G12 8QQ, Lanark, Scotland; [Shirakawa, Masahiro] Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Engn, Dept Mol Engn, Nishikyo Ku, Kyoto 6158510, Japan; [Guentert, Peter] Frankfurt Inst Adv Studies, D-60438 Frankfurt, Germany","Ito, Y (reprint author), Tokyo Metropolitan Univ, Dept Chem, 1-1 Minami Osawa, Tokyo 1920397, Japan.",ito-yutaka@tmu.ac.jp,"Mikawa, Tsutomu/E-6510-2013; Guntert, Peter/L-5577-2013; Smith, Brian/J-1899-2015; Ito, Yutaka/P-2604-2015; Fachbereich14, Dekanat/C-8553-2015","Mikawa, Tsutomu/0000-0003-2325-5084; Guntert, Peter/0000-0002-2911-7574; Smith, Brian/0000-0003-3363-4168; Ito, Yutaka/0000-0002-1030-4660; ","CREST, Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST); Molecular Ensemble Program, RIKEN; Japanese Ministry of Education, Sports, Culture, Science, and Technology; Volkswagen Foundation;  [TTHA1718]","The authors thank S.

This method has been successfully applied to proteins overexpressed in bacteria, providing information on protein-ligand interactions(2) and conformations(3,4). However, the application of in-cell NMR to eukaryotic cells has been limited to Xenopus laevis oocytes(5-7). Wider application of the technique is hampered by inefficient delivery of isotope-labelled proteins into eukaryote somatic cells. Here we describe a method to obtain high-resolution two-dimensional (2D) heteronuclear NMR spectra of proteins inside living human cells. Proteins were delivered to the cytosol by the pyrenebutyrate-mediated action of cell-penetrating peptides(8) linked covalently to the proteins. The proteins were subsequently released from cell-penetrating peptides by endogenous enzymatic activity or by autonomous reductive cleavage. The heteronuclear 2D spectra of three different proteins inside human cells demonstrate the broad application of this technique to studying interactions and protein processing. The in-cell NMR spectra of FKBP12 (also known as FKBP1A) show the formation of specific complexes between the protein and extracellularly administered immunosuppressants, demonstrating the utility of this technique in drug screening programs. Moreover, in-cell NMRspectroscopy demonstrates that ubiquitin has much higher hydrogen exchange rates in the intracellular environment, possibly due to multiple interactions with endogenous proteins.","[Inomata, Kohsuke; Ohno, Ayako; Tochio, Hidehito; Isogai, Shin; Shirakawa, Masahiro] Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Engn, Dept Mol Engn, Nishikyo Ku, Kyoto 6158510, Japan; [Inomata, Kohsuke; Tochio, Hidehito; Tenno, Takeshi; Ito, Yutaka; Hiroaki, Hidekazu; Shirakawa, Masahiro] JST, CREST, Kawaguchi, Saitama 3320012, Japan; [Futaki, Shiroh] JST, SORST, Kawaguchi, Saitama 3320012, Japan; [Tenno, Takeshi; Hiroaki, Hidekazu] Kobe Univ, Grad Sch Med, Div Struct Biol, Chuo Ku, Kobe, Hyogo 6500017, Japan; [Nakase, Ikuhiko; Takeuchi, Toshihide; Futaki, Shiroh] Kyoto Univ, Inst Chem Res, Kyoto 6110011, Japan; [Ito, Yutaka] Tokyo Metropolitan Univ, Dept Chem, Tokyo 1920397, Japan; [Shirakawa, Masahiro] RIKEN, Yokohama Inst, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2300045, Japan","Shirakawa, M (reprint author), Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Engn, Dept Mol Engn, Nishikyo Ku, Kyoto 6158510, Japan.",tochio@moleng.kyoto-u.ac.jp; shirakawa@moleng.kyoto-u.ac.jp,"; Tochio, Hidehito/F-6109-2011; Hiroaki, Hidekazu /G-9564-2012; Ito, Yutaka/P-2604-2015","Tochio, Hidehito/0000-0003-3843-3330; Inomata, Kohsuke/0000-0002-6816-7961; Ito, Yutaka/0000-0002-1030-4660; Hiroaki, Hidekazu/0000-0003-1621-5893","Japan Science and Technology Agency and the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology-Japan (MEXT); Global COE Program 'International Center for Integrated Research and Advanced Education in Materials Science' [B-09]; Japan Society for the Promotion of Science; Innovative Techno-Hub for Integrated Medical Bio-imaging Project of the Special Coordination Funds for Promoting Science and Technology, from MEXT; MEXT;  [FKBP12]","We thank M.

There are gaps, known as the Kirkwood gaps, in distinct locations that are associated with orbital resonances with the giant planets(1); asteroids placed in these locations will follow chaotic orbits and be removed(2). Here we show that the observed distribution of main belt asteroids does not fill uniformly even those regions that are dynamically stable over the age of the Solar System. We find a pattern of excess depletion of asteroids, particularly just outward of the Kirkwood gaps associated with the 5:2, the 7:3 and the 2:1 Jovian resonances. These features are not accounted for by planetary perturbations in the current structure of the Solar System, but are consistent with dynamical ejection of asteroids by the sweeping of gravitational resonances during the migration of Jupiter and Saturn similar to 4 Gyr ago.","[Minton, David A.; Malhotra, Renu] Univ Arizona, Lunar & Planetary Lab, Tucson, AZ 85716 USA","Minton, DA (reprint author), Univ Arizona, Lunar & Planetary Lab, 1629 E Univ Blvd, Tucson, AZ 85716 USA.",daminton@lpl.arizona.edu,,"Malhotra, Renu/0000-0002-1226-3305",NASA; NSF,We acknowledge research funding from NASA and NSF.,,20,76,76,1,4,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,26-Feb,2009,457,7233,,,,,1109,1111,,10.1038/nature07778,,3,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,411VI,WOS:000263680100035,19242470,No,,,11/20/17

Conventional magnetoresistance in doped semiconductors is straightforwardly explained as the effect of the Lorentz force on the carrier motion(15), but the reported unusually large effects imply that the underlying mechanisms have not yet been fully explored. Here we report that a simple device, based on a lightly doped silicon substrate between two metallic contacts, shows a large positive magnetoresistance of more than 1,000 per cent at room temperature (300 K) and 10,000 per cent at 25 K, for magnetic fields between 0 and 3 T. A high electric field is applied to the device, so that conduction is space-charge limited(16-18). For substrates with a charge carrier density below similar to 10(13) cm(-3), the magnetoresistance exhibits a linear dependence on the magnetic field between 3 and 9 T. We propose that the observed large magnetoresistance can be explained by quasi-neutrality breaking of the space-charge effect, where insufficient charge is present to compensate the electrons injected into the device. This introduces an electric field inhomogeneity, analogous to the situation in other semiconductors in which a large, non-saturating magnetoresistance was observed(1-5,19). In this regime, the motions of electrons become correlated, and thus become dependent on magnetic field. Although large positive magnetoresistance at room temperature has been achieved in metal-semiconductor hybrid devices(6-8), we have now realized it in a simpler structure and in a way different from other known magnetoresistive effects(9-14,20). It could be used to develop new magnetic devices from silicon, which may further advance silicon technology.","[Delmo, Michael P.; Kasai, Shinya; Ono, Teruo; Kobayashi, Kensuke] Kyoto Univ, Inst Chem Res, Kyoto 6110011, Japan; [Yamamoto, Shinpei] Kyoto Univ, Inst Integrated Cell Mat Sci, Kyoto 6110011, Japan","Kobayashi, K (reprint author), Kyoto Univ, Inst Chem Res, Kyoto 6110011, Japan.",kensuke@scl.kyoto-u.ac.jp,"Kobayashi, Kensuke/E-5404-2010; KASAI, Shinya/H-2808-2011","Kobayashi, Kensuke/0000-0001-7072-5945; KASAI, Shinya/0000-0001-7149-4800; Delmo, Michael/0000-0002-1815-4580",KAKENHI; ICR; Asahi Glass Foundation; Sumitomo Foundation; JSPS,"We appreciate discussions with T.

Although continuum mechanics models have been predicted to break down at the nanoscale(1), they continue to be applied for lack of a better theory. An understanding of how friction force depends on applied load and contact area at these scales is essential for the design of miniaturized devices with optimal mechanical performance(2,3). Here we use large-scale molecular dynamics simulations with realistic force fields to establish friction laws in dry nanoscale contacts. We show that friction force depends linearly on the number of atoms that chemically interact across the contact. By defining the contact area as being proportional to this number of interacting atoms, we show that the macroscopically observed linear relationship between friction force and contact area can be extended to the nanoscale. Our model predicts that as the adhesion between the contacting surfaces is reduced, a transition takes place from nonlinear to linear dependence of friction force on load. This transition is consistent with the results of several nanoscale friction experiments(4-7). We demonstrate that the breakdown of continuum mechanics can be understood as a result of the rough (multi-asperity) nature of the contact, and show that roughness theories(8-10) of friction can be applied at the nanoscale.","[Mo, Yifei; Turner, Kevin T.; Szlufarska, Izabela] Univ Wisconsin, Mat Sci Program, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Turner, Kevin T.] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Mech Engn, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Turner, Kevin T.; Szlufarska, Izabela] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Madison, WI 53706 USA","Szlufarska, I (reprint author), Univ Wisconsin, Mat Sci Program, Madison, WI 53706 USA.",izabela@engr.wisc.edu,"Mo, Yifei/F-5671-2011","Mo, Yifei/0000-0002-8162-4629",National Science Foundation [DMR-0512228]; American Chemical Society [PRF-47978-G5],We thank D.

Small-scale dunes form by destabilization of the sand bed(9-11) with a wavelength (a few tens of metres) determined by the sand transport saturation length(11-13). The mechanisms controlling the formation of giant dunes, and in particular accounting for their typical time and length scales, have remained unknown. Using a combination of field measurements and aerodynamic calculations, we show here that the growth of aeolian giant dunes, ascribed to the non-linear interaction between small-scale superimposed dunes(4,10,14,15), is limited by the confinement of the flow within the atmospheric boundary layer(16,17). Aeolian giant dunes and river dunes form by similar processes, with the thermal inversion layer that caps the convective boundary layer in the atmosphere(18) acting analogously to the water surface in rivers. In both cases, the bed topography excites surface waves on the interface that in turn modify the near-bed flow velocity. This mechanism is a stabilizing process that prevents the scale of the pattern from coarsening beyond the resonant condition. Our results can explain the mean spacing of aeolian giant dunes ranging from 300m in coastal terrestrial deserts to 3.5 km. We propose that our findings could serve as a starting point for the modelling of long-term evolution of desert landscapes under specific wind regimes.","[Andreotti, Bruno; Fourriere, Antoine; Claudin, Philippe] ESPCI, PMMH, CNRS,UMR 7636, Lab Phys & Mecan Milieux Heterogenes,P6,P7, F-75005 Paris, France; [Ould-Kaddour, Fouzia] Univ Abou Bekr Belkaid, Phys Theor Lab, Tilimsen, Algeria; [Murray, Brad] Duke Univ, Ctr Nonlinear & Complex Syst, Nicholas Sch Environm & Earth Sci, Durham, NC 27708 USA","Claudin, P (reprint author), ESPCI, PMMH, CNRS,UMR 7636, Lab Phys & Mecan Milieux Heterogenes,P6,P7, 10 Rue Vanquelin, F-75005 Paris, France.",claudin@pmmh.espci.fr,,,ANR,We thank R.

Recently the first known embryos were discovered within the Placodermi(1), an extinct class of armoured fish, indicating a viviparous mode of reproduction in a vertebrate group outside the crown-group Gnathostomata (Chondrichthyes and Osteichthyes). These embryos were found in ptyctodontids, a small group of placoderms phylogenetically basal to the largest group, the Arthrodira(2,3). Here we report the discovery of embryos in the Arthrodira inside specimens of Incisoscutum ritchiei from the Upper Devonian Gogo Formation of Western Australia(4) (approximately 380 million years ago), providing the first evidence, to our knowledge, for reproduction using internal fertilization in this diverse group. We show that Incisoscutum and some phyllolepid arthrodires possessed pelvic girdles with long basipterygia that articulated distally with an additional cartilaginous element or series, as in chondrichthyans, indicating that the pelvic fin was used in copulation. As homology between similar pelvic girdle skeletal structures in ptyctodontids, arthrodires and chondrichthyans is difficult to reconcile in the light of current phylogenies of lower gnathostomes(2,3,5), we explain these similarities as being most likely due to convergence (homoplasy). These new finds confirm that reproduction by internal fertilization and viviparity was much more widespread in the earliest gnathostomes than had been previously appreciated.","[Long, John A.] Victoria & Albert Museum, Melbourne, Vic 3001, Australia; [Long, John A.] Australian Natl Univ, Res Sch Earth Sci, Canberra, ACT 2600, Australia; [Long, John A.] Monash Univ, Sch Geosci, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia; [Trinajstic, Kate] Univ Western Australia, Sch Earth & Geog Sci, Perth, WA 6009, Australia; [Johanson, Zerina] Nat Hist Museum, London SW7 5BD, England","Long, JA (reprint author), Victoria & Albert Museum, POB 666, Melbourne, Vic 3001, Australia.",jlong@museum.vic.gov.au,"Trinajstic, Kate/B-2537-2009","Johanson, Zerina/0000-0002-8444-6776; Long, John/0000-0001-8012-0114; Trinajstic, Kate/0000-0002-6519-6396",Australian Research Council,"We thank M.

Prefibrillar, soluble oligomers of amyloid-beta have been recognized to be early and key intermediates in Alzheimer's-disease-related synaptic dysfunction(2-9). At nanomolar concentrations, soluble amyloid-beta oligomers block hippocampal long-term potentiation(7), cause dendritic spine retraction from pyramidal cells(5,8) and impair rodent spatial memory(2). Soluble amyloid-beta oligomers have been prepared from chemical syntheses, transfected cell culture supernatants, transgenic mouse brain and human Alzheimer's disease brain(2,4,7,9). Together, these data imply a high-affinity cell-surface receptor for soluble amyloid-beta oligomers on neurons-one that is central to the pathophysiological process in Alzheimer's disease. Here we identify the cellular prion protein (PrP(C)) as an amyloid-beta-oligomer receptor by expression cloning. Amyloid-beta oligomers bind with nanomolar affinity to PrP(C), but the interaction does not require the infectious PrP(Sc) conformation. Synaptic responsiveness in hippocampal slices from young adult PrP null mice is normal, but the amyloid-beta oligomer blockade of long-term potentiation is absent. Anti-PrP antibodies prevent amyloid-beta-oligomer binding to PrP(C) and rescue synaptic plasticity in hippocampal slices from oligomeric amyloid-beta. Thus, PrP(C) is a mediator of amyloid-beta-oligomer-induced synaptic dysfunction, and PrP(C)-specific pharmaceuticals may have therapeutic potential for Alzheimer's disease.","[Lauren, Juha; Gimbel, David A.; Nygaard, Haakon B.; Gilbert, John W.; Strittmatter, Stephen M.] Yale Univ, Sch Med, Cellular Neurosci Neurodegenerat & Repair Program, New Haven, CT 06536 USA","Strittmatter, SM (reprint author), Yale Univ, Sch Med, Cellular Neurosci Neurodegenerat & Repair Program, 333 Cedar St, New Haven, CT 06536 USA.",stephen.strittmatter@yale.edu,,"Strittmatter, Stephen/0000-0001-8188-3092",Brown-Coxe Postdoctoral Fellow; NIH [5T32GN07205]; Kavli Institute for Neuroscience at Yale University; Falk Medical Research Trust; NIDA,"We thank S.

We asked whether local intracortical circuits reflect these different processing streams by testing whether the intracortical connectivity among pyramidal neurons reflects their long-range axonal targets. We recorded simultaneously from up to four retrogradely labelled pyramidal neurons that projected to the superior colliculus, the contralateral striatum or the contralateral cortex to assess their synaptic connectivity. Here we show that the probability of synaptic connection depends on the functional identities of both the presynaptic and postsynaptic neurons. We first found that the frequency of monosynaptic connections among corticostriatal pyramidal neurons is significantly higher than among corticocortical or corticotectal pyramidal neurons. We then show that the probability of feed-forward connections from corticocortical neurons to corticotectal neurons is approximately three- to four-fold higher than the probability of monosynaptic connections among corticocortical or corticotectal cells. Moreover, we found that the average axodendritic overlap of the presynaptic and postsynaptic pyramidal neurons could not fully explain the differences in connection probability that we observed. The selective synaptic interactions we describe demonstrate that the organization of local networks of pyramidal cells reflects the long-range targets of both the presynaptic and postsynaptic neurons.","[Brown, Solange P.; Hestrin, Shaul] Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Dept Comparat Med, Stanford, CA 94305 USA","Hestrin, S (reprint author), Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Dept Comparat Med, 300 Pasteur Dr,Edwards Bldg,R314, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",shaul.hestrin@stanford.edu,"Hestrin, Shaul/F-4410-2010; Brown, Solange/H-1615-2012",,National Institutes of Health,We thank J.

In cortical output neurons such as the large pyramidal cells of layer 5 (L5), activation of apical dendritic calcium channels leads to plateau potentials that increase the gain of the input/output function(5) and switch the cell to burst-firing mode(6-9). The apical dendrites are innervated by local excitatory and inhibitory inputs as well as thalamic(10-13) and corticocortical projections(14-16), which makes it a formidable task to predict how these inputs influence active dendritic properties in vivo. Here we investigate activity in populations of L5 pyramidal dendrites of the somatosensory cortex in awake and anaesthetized rats following sensory stimulation using a new fibre-optic method(17) for recording dendritic calcium changes. We show that the strength of sensory stimulation is encoded in the combined dendritic calcium response of a local population of L5 pyramidal cells in a graded manner. The slope of the stimulus-response function was under the control of a particular subset of inhibitory neurons activated by synaptic inputs predominantly in L5. Recordings from single apical tuft dendrites in vitro showed that activity in L5 pyramidal neurons disynaptically coupled via interneurons directly blocks the initiation of dendritic calcium spikes in neighbouring pyramidal neurons. The results constitute a functional description of a cortical microcircuit in awake animals that relies on the active properties of L5 pyramidal dendrites and their very high sensitivity to inhibition. The microcircuit is organized so that local populations of apical dendrites can adaptively encode bottom-up sensory stimuli linearly across their full dynamic range.","[Murayama, Masanori; Perez-Garci, Enrique; Nevian, Thomas; Bock, Tobias; Senn, Walter; Larkum, Matthew E.] Univ Bern, Inst Physiol, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland","Larkum, ME (reprint author), Univ Bern, Inst Physiol, Buhlpl 5, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland.",larkum@pyl.unibe.ch,"Murayama, Masanori/B-4319-2009; Senn, Walter/D-6308-2014; Murayama, Masanori/G-5457-2015","Senn, Walter/0000-0003-3622-0497; Murayama, Masanori/0000-0001-7623-010X; Nevian, Thomas/0000-0001-9804-608X",Swiss National Science Foundation [PP00A-102721/1],"We thank K.

The dendrites of individual cortical neurons overlap with numerous types of local and long-range excitatory axons, but axodendritic overlap is not always a good predictor of actual connection strength(3-5). Here we developed an efficient channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2)-assisted method(6-8) to map the spatial distribution of synaptic inputs, defined by presynaptic ChR2 expression, within the dendritic arborizations of recorded neurons. We expressed ChR2 in two thalamic nuclei, the whisker motor cortex and local excitatory neurons and mapped their synapses with pyramidal neurons in layers 3, 5A and 5B (L3, L5A and L5B) in the mouse barrel cortex. Within the dendritic arborizations of L3 cells, individual inputs impinged onto distinct single domains. These domains were arrayed in an orderly, monotonic pattern along the apical axis: axons from more central origins targeted progressively higher regions of the apical dendrites. In L5 arborizations, different inputs targeted separate basal and apical domains. Input to L3 and L5 dendrites in L1 was related to whisker movement and position, suggesting that these signals have a role in controlling the gain of their target neurons(9).

Upon stimulation by insulin, insulin receptor recruits and phosphorylates insulin receptor substrate proteins(3), leading to activation of the phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase (PI(3) K)-Akt pathway. Activated Akt phosphorylates downstream kinases and transcription factors, thus mediating most of the metabolic actions of insulin(4-6). beta-arrestins mediate biological functions of G-protein-coupled receptors by linking activated receptors with distinct sets of accessory and effecter proteins, thereby determining the specificity, efficiency and capacity of signals(7-11). Here we show that in diabetic mouse models, beta-arrestin-2 is severely downregulated. Knockdown of beta-arrestin-2 exacerbates insulin resistance, whereas administration of beta-arrestin-2 restores insulin sensitivity in mice. Further investigation reveals that insulin stimulates the formation of a new beta-arrestin-2 signal complex, in which beta-arrestin-2 scaffolds Akt and Src to insulin receptor. Loss or dysfunction of beta-arrestin-2 results in deficiency of this signal complex and disturbance of insulin signalling in vivo, thereby contributing to the development of insulin resistance and progression of type 2 diabetes. Our findings provide new insight into the molecular pathogenesis of insulin resistance, and implicate new preventive and therapeutic strategies against insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes.","[Luan, Bing; Zhao, Jian; Duan, Baoyu; Shu, Guangwen; Kang, Jiuhong; Pei, Gang] Chinese Acad Sci, Mol Cell Biol Lab, Inst Biochem & Cell Biol, Shanghai 200031, Peoples R China; [Luan, Bing; Zhao, Jian; Duan, Baoyu; Shu, Guangwen; Kang, Jiuhong; Pei, Gang] Chinese Acad Sci, Grad Sch, Shanghai 200031, Peoples R China; [Li, Dangsheng] Chinese Acad Sci, Shanghai Inst Biol Sci, Shanghai Informat Ctr Life Sci, Shanghai 200031, Peoples R China; [Wu, Haiya; Jia, Weiping] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Dept Endocrinol & Metab, Affiliated Peoples Hosp 6, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Wu, Haiya; Jia, Weiping] Shanghai Diabet Inst, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Wu, Haiya; Jia, Weiping] Shanghai Clin Ctr Diabet, Shanghai 200233, Peoples R China; [Wang, Xiaoying] Fudan Univ, Affiliated Zhongshan Hosp, Shanghai 200032, Peoples R China; [Pei, Gang] Tongji Univ, Sch Life Sci & Technol, Shanghai 200092, Peoples R China","Pei, G (reprint author), Chinese Acad Sci, Mol Cell Biol Lab, Inst Biochem & Cell Biol, Shanghai 200031, Peoples R China.",gpei@sibs.ac.cn,"Luan, Bing/B-5521-2014","Luan, Bing/0000-0002-0409-2964","Ministry of Science and Technology [2005CB522406, 2006CB943900, 2007CB947904, 2007CB947100, 2007CB948000, 2009CB941100]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [30621091, 30625014, 30623003, 30871285, 90713047]; Shanghai Municipal Commission for Science and Technology [07PJ14099, 06DZ22032]; Chinese Academy of Sciences [KSCX2-YW-R-56, 2007KIP204]","We are grateful to R.

However, although the developmental plasticity of plant cells has been demonstrated(1), it is not known whether the stem cell niche is required for organogenesis. Here we explore the capacity of a broad range of differentiating cells to regenerate an organ without the activity of a stem cell niche. Using a root-tip regeneration system in Arabidopsis thaliana to track the molecular and functional recovery of cell fates, we show that respecification of lost cell identities begins within hours of excision and that the function of specialized cells is restored within one day. Critically, regeneration proceeds in plants with mutations that fail to maintain the stem cell niche. These results show that stem-cell-like properties that mediate complete organ regeneration are dispersed in plant meristems and are not restricted to niches, which nonetheless seem to be necessary for indeterminate growth. This regenerative reprogramming of an entire organ without transition to a stereotypical stem cell environment has intriguing parallels to recent reports of induced transdifferentiation of specific cell types in the adult organs of animals(2,3).","[Sena, Giovanni; Wang, Xiaoning; Liu, Hsiao-Yun; Birnbaum, Kenneth D.] NYU, Dept Biol, Ctr Genom & Syst Biol, New York, NY 10003 USA; [Hofhuis, Hugo] Univ Utrecht, Fac Sci, Dept Biol, NL-3584 CH Utrecht, Netherlands","Birnbaum, KD (reprint author), NYU, Dept Biol, Ctr Genom & Syst Biol, Silver Bldg,100 Washington Sq E, New York, NY 10003 USA.",ken.birnbaum@nyu.edu,"Sena, Giovanni/C-3297-2012","Sena, Giovanni/0000-0003-3626-5038",National Institutes of Health [5R01GM078279],"We thank B.

Salicylic acid, a critical messenger, is also required for both of these responses(2,3), but whether and how salicylic acid level is regulated by Ca2+ signalling during plant-pathogen interaction is unclear. Here we report a mechanism connecting Ca2+ signal to salicylic-acid-mediated immune response through calmodulin, AtSR1 (also known as CAMTA3), a Ca2+/calmodulin-binding transcription factor, and EDS1, an established regulator of salicylic acid level. Constitutive disease resistance and elevated levels of salicylic acid in loss-of-function alleles of Arabidopsis AtSR1 suggest that AtSR1 is a negative regulator of plant immunity. This was confirmed by epistasis analysis with mutants of compromised salicylic acid accumulation and disease resistance. We show that AtSR1 interacts with the promoter of EDS1 and represses its expression. Furthermore, Ca2+/calmodulin-binding to AtSR1 is required for suppression of plant defence, indicating a direct role for Ca2+/calmodulin in regulating the function of AtSR1. These results reveal a previously unknown regulatory mechanism linking Ca2+ signalling to salicylic acid level.","[Du, Liqun; Simons, Kayla A.; Yang, Tianbao; Poovaiah, B.

Although several experiments indicate their existence, lipid nanodomains ('rafts') remain controversial owing to the lack of suitable detection techniques in living cells(4,6-9). The controversy is reflected in their putative size of 5-200 nm, spanning the range between the extent of a protein complex and the resolution limit of optical microscopy. Here we demonstrate the ability of stimulated emission depletion (STED) far-field fluorescence nanoscopy(10) to detect single diffusing (lipid) molecules in nanosized areas in the plasma membrane of living cells. Tuning of the probed area to spot sizes similar to 70-fold below the diffraction barrier reveals that unlike phosphoglycerolipids, sphingolipids and glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored proteins are transiently (similar to 10-20 ms) trapped in cholesterol-mediated molecular complexes dwelling within <20-nm diameter areas.

The Methanosarcinaceae produce Pyl and express Pyl-containing methyltransferases that allow growth on methylamines(2). Homologous methyltransferases and the Pyl biosynthetic and coding machinery are also found in two bacterial species(1,3). Pyl coding is maintained by pyrrolysyl-tRNA synthetase (PylRS), which catalyses the formation of Pyl-tRNA(Pyl) (refs 4, 5). Pyl is not a recent addition to the genetic code. PylRS was already present in the last universal common ancestor(6); it then persisted in organisms that utilize methylamines as energy sources. Recent protein engineering efforts added non-canonical amino acids to the genetic code(7,8). This technology relies on the directed evolution of an 'orthogonal' tRNA synthetase-tRNA pair in which an engineered aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase (aaRS) specifically and exclusively acylates the orthogonal tRNA with a non-canonical amino acid. For Pyl the natural evolutionary process developed such a system some 3 billion years ago. When transformed into Escherichia coli, Methanosarcina barkeri PylRS and tRNA(Pyl) function as an orthogonal pair in vivo(5,9). Here we show that Desulfitobacterium hafniense PylRS-tRNA(Pyl) is an orthogonal pair in vitro and in vivo, and present the crystal structure of this orthogonal pair. The ancient emergence of PylRS tRNA(Pyl) allowed the evolution of unique structural features in both the protein and the tRNA. These structural elements manifest an intricate, specialized aaRS-tRNA interaction surface that is highly distinct from those observed in any other known aaRS-tRNA complex; it is this general property that underlies the molecular basis of orthogonality.","[O'Donoghue, Patrick; Gundllapalli, Sarath; Umehara, Takuya; Soell, Dieter] Yale Univ, Dept Mol Biophys & Biochem, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Soell, Dieter] Yale Univ, Dept Chem, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Nozawa, Kayo; Araiso, Yuhei; Nureki, Osamu] Tokyo Inst Technol, Grad Sch Biosci & Biotechnol, Dept Biol Informat, Midori Ku, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2268501, Japan; [Ishitani, Ryuichiro; Nureki, Osamu] Univ Tokyo, Inst Med Sci, Dept Basic Med Sci, Minato Ku, Tokyo 1088639, Japan","Soll, D (reprint author), Yale Univ, Dept Mol Biophys & Biochem, POB 6666, New Haven, CT 06520 USA.",dieter.soll@yale.edu; nureki@ims.u-tokyo.ac.jp,,,"National Science Foundation; Japan Science and Technology Agency; Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology; Mitsubishi Foundation; Kurata Memorial Hitachi Science and Technology Foundation; National Institute of General Medical Sciences; Department of Energy","We thank the beamline staff at BL41XU of SPring-8 (Harima, Japan) and NW12 of PF-AR (Tsukuba, Japan) for technical help during data collection.

Here we report that beta-amyloid precursor protein ( APP) and death receptor 6 ( DR6, also known as TNFRSF21) activate a widespread caspase- dependent self- destruction program. DR6 is broadly expressed by developing neurons, and is required for normal cell body death and axonal pruning both in vivo and after trophic- factor deprivation in vitro. Unlike neuronal cell body apoptosis, which requires caspase 3, we show that axonal degeneration requires caspase 6, which is activated in a punctate pattern that parallels the pattern of axonal fragmentation. DR6 is activated locally by an inactive surface ligand( s) that is released in an active form after trophic- factor deprivation, and we identify APP as a DR6 ligand. Trophic- factor deprivation triggers the shedding of surface APP in a beta-secretase ( BACE)- dependent manner. Loss- and gain- of- function studies support a model in which a cleaved amino- terminal fragment of APP ( N- APP) binds DR6 and triggers degeneration. Genetic support is provided by a common neuromuscular junction phenotype in mutant mice. Our results indicate that APP and DR6 are components of a neuronal self- destruction pathway, and suggest that an extracellular fragment of APP, acting via DR6 and caspase 6, contributes to Alzheimer's disease.","[Nikolaev, Anatoly; Tessier-Lavigne, Marc] Genentech Inc, Div Res, San Francisco, CA 94080 USA; [McLaughlin, Todd; O'Leary, Dennis D.

Despite repeated atttempts(3,4), it has previously been seen only from HI emission, suggesting the absence of a stellar population. Here we report the detection of ultraviolet light from gaseous substructures of the Leo ring, which we attribute to recent massive star formation. The ultraviolet colour of the detected complexes is blue, implying the onset of a burst of star formation or continuous star formation of moderate (similar to 10(8)-yr) duration. Measured ultraviolet visible photometry favours models with low metallicity (Z approximate to Z./ 50-Z./5, Z. denoting the solar metallicity), that is, a low proportion of elements heavier than helium, although spectroscopic confirmation is needed. We speculate that the complexes are dwarf galaxies observed during their formation, but distinguished by their lack of a dark matter component(5). In this regard, they resemble tidal dwarf galaxies, although without the enrichment preceding tidal stripping.

Its imaging variant - magnetic resonance imaging(4,5) (MRI) - is widely used to examine the anatomy, physiology and metabolism of the human body. NMRsignal detection is traditionally based on Faraday induction(6) in one or multiple radio- frequency resonators(7-10) that are brought into close proximity with the sample. Alternative principles involving structured-material flux guides(11), superconducting quantum interference devices(12), atomic magnetometers(13), Hall probes(14) or magnetoresistive elements(15) have been explored. However, a common feature of all NMR implementations until now is that they rely on close coupling between the detector and the object under investigation. Here we show that NMR can also be excited and detected by long-range interaction, relying on travelling radio- frequency waves sent and received by an antenna. One benefit of this approach is more uniform coverage of samples that are larger than the wavelength of the NMR signal - an important current issue in MRI of humans at very high magnetic fields.

The role of tropical forests is critical because they are carbon- dense and highly productive(3,4). Inventory plots across Amazonia show that old- growth forests have increased in carbon storage over recent decades(5-7), but the response of one- third of the world's tropical forests in Africa(8) is largely unknown owing to an absence of spatially extensive observation networks(9,10). Here we report data from a ten- country network of long- term monitoring plots in African tropical forests. We find that across 79 plots ( 163 ha) above- ground carbon storage in live trees increased by 0.63 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1) between 1968 and 2007 ( 95% confidence interval ( CI), 0.22 - 0.94; mean interval, 1987 - 96). Extrapolation to unmeasured forest components ( live roots, small trees, necromass) and scaling to the continent implies a total increase in carbon storage in African tropical forest trees of 0.34 Pg C yr(-1) ( CI, 0.15 - 0.43). These reported changes in carbon storage are similar to those reported for Amazonian forests per unit area(6,7), providing evidence that increasing carbon storage in old- growth forests is a pan- tropical phenomenon. Indeed, combining all standardized inventory data from this study and from tropical America and Asia(5,6,11) together yields a comparable figure of 0.49 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1) (n = 156; 562 ha; CI, 0.29 - 0.66; mean interval, 1987 - 97). This indicates a carbon sink of 1.3 Pg C yr(-1) ( CI, 0.8 - 1.6) across all tropical forests during recent decades. Taxon- specific analyses of African inventory and other data(12) suggest that widespread changes in resource availability, such as increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations, may be the cause of the increase in carbon stocks(13), as some theory(14) and models(2,10,15) predict.","[Lewis, Simon L.; Lopez-Gonzalez, Gabriela; Baker, Timothy R.; Phillips, Oliver L.; Feldpausch, Ted R.; Gloor, Manuel; Lloyd, Jon; Peacock, Julie; Peh, Kelvin S. -H.] Univ Leeds, Earth & Biosphere Inst, Sch Geog, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England; [Sonke, Bonaventure; Djuikouo K., Marie-Noel] Univ Yaounde I, Plant Systemat & Ecol Lab, Yaounde, Cameroon; [Affum-Baffoe, Kofi; Votere, Raymond] Forestry Commiss Ghana, Resource Management Support Ctr, Kumasi, Ghana; [Ojo, Lucas O.] Univ Agr, Dept Environm Management & Toxicol, Abeokuta, Ogun, Nigeria; [Reitsma, Jan M.] Bur Waardenburg BV, NL-4100 AJ Culemborg, Netherlands; [White, Lee] IRET, Libreville, Gabon; [Comiskey, James A.; Sunderland, Terry] Smithsonian Inst, SI MAB Biodivers Program, Washington, DC 20560 USA; [Ewango, Corneille E.

In vertebrates, the molecular pathway that leads to this asymmetry uses the signalling molecule Nodal, a member of the transforming growth factor-beta superfamily(1), which is expressed in the left lateral plate mesoderm(2), and loss of nodal function produces a randomization of the left - right asymmetry of visceral organs(3,4). Orthologues of nodal have also been described in other deuterostomes, including ascidians and sea urchins(5,6), but no nodal orthologue has been reported in the other two main clades of Bilateria: Ecdysozoa ( including flies and nematodes) and Lophotrochozoa ( including snails and annelids). Here we report the first evidence for a nodal orthologue in a non- deuterostome group. We isolated nodal and Pitx ( one of the targets of Nodal signalling) in two species of snails and found that the side of the embryo that expresses nodal and Pitx is related to body chirality: both genes are expressed on the right side of the embryo in the dextral ( right- handed) species Lottia gigantea and on the left side in the sinistral ( left- handed) species Biomphalaria glabrata. We pharmacologically inhibited the Nodal pathway and found that nodal acts upstream of Pitx, and that some treated animals developed with a loss of shell chirality. These results indicate that the involvement of the Nodal pathway in left - right asymmetry might have been an ancestral feature of the Bilateria.","[Grande, Cristina; Patel, Nipam H.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mol & Cell Biol, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Grande, Cristina; Patel, Nipam H.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Integrat Biol, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Grande, Cristina; Patel, Nipam H.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Ctr Integrat Genom, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA","Patel, NH (reprint author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mol & Cell Biol, 229 Stanley Hall, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",nipam@uclink.berkeley.edu,"Grande, Cristina/N-8956-2015",,Ministerio de Educacion y Ciencia (Spain); Center for Integrative Genomics,"We thank E.

In addition to seasonal influenza, a new strain of influenza virus against which no previous immunity exists and that demonstrates human- to- human transmission could result in a pandemic with millions of fatalities(2). Early detection of disease activity, when followed by a rapid response, can reduce the impact of both seasonal and pandemic influenza(3,4). One way to improve early detection is to monitor health- seeking behaviour in the form of queries to online search engines, which are submitted by millions of users around the world each day. Here we present a method of analysing large numbers of Google search queries to track influenza- like illness in a population. Because the relative frequency of certain queries is highly correlated with the percentage of physician visits in which a patient presents with influenza- like symptoms, we can accurately estimate the current level of weekly influenza activity in each region of the United States, with a reporting lag of about one day. This approach may make it possible to use search queries to detect influenza epidemics in areas with a large population of web search users.","[Ginsberg, Jeremy; Mohebbi, Matthew H.; Patel, Rajan S.; Smolinski, Mark S.; Brilliant, Larry] Google Inc, Mountain View, CA 94043 USA; [Brammer, Lynnette] Ctr Dis Control & Prevent, Atlanta, GA 30333 USA","Ginsberg, J (reprint author), Google Inc, 1600 Amphitheatre Pkwy, Mountain View, CA 94043 USA.",flutrends-support@google.com,,,,,,12,1100,1142,20,256,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,19-Feb,2009,457,7232,,,,,1012,U4,,10.1038/nature07634,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,408HF,WOS:000263425400042,19020500,No,Y,N,11/20/17

Experiments and theory indicate that neuronal firing typically represents the sum of synaptic inputs(1-3), an additive operation, but multiplication of inputs is essential for many computations(1). Multiplication by a constant produces a change in the slope, or gain, of the input - output relationship, amplifying or scaling down the sensitivity of the neuron to changes in its input. Such gain modulation occurs in vivo, during contrast invariance of orientation tuning(4), attentional scaling(5), translation- invariant object recognition(6), auditory processing(7) and coordinate transformations(8,9). Moreover, theoretical studies highlight the necessity of gain modulation in several of these tasks(9-11). Although potential cellular mechanisms for gain modulation have been identified, they often rely on membrane noise and require restrictive conditions to work(3,12-18). Because nonlinear components are used to scale signals in electronics, we examined whether synaptic nonlinearities are involved in neuronal gain modulation. We used synaptic stimulation and the dynamic- clamp technique to investigate gain modulation in granule cells in acute slices of rat cerebellum. Here we show that when excitation is mediated by synapses with short- term depression ( STD), neuronal gain is controlled by an inhibitory conductance in a noise-independent manner, allowing driving and modulatory inputs to be multiplied together. The nonlinearity introduced by STD transforms inhibition- mediated additive shifts in the input - output relationship into multiplicative gain changes. When granule cells were driven with bursts of high- frequency mossy fibre input, as observed in vivo(19,20), larger inhibition- mediated gain changes were observed, as expected with greater STD. Simulations of synaptic integration in more complex neocortical neurons suggest that STD- based gain modulation can also operate in neurons with large dendritic trees. Our results establish that neurons receiving depressing excitatory inputs can act as powerful multiplicative devices even when integration of postsynaptic conductances is linear.","[Rothman, Jason S.; Cathala, Laurence; Steuber, Volker; Silver, R.

The Fas - FADD DISC represents a receptor platform, which once assembled initiates the induction of programmed cell death. A highly oligomeric network of homotypic protein interactions comprised of the death domains of Fas and FADD is at the centre of DISC formation(4,5). Thus, characterizing the mechanistic basis for the Fas - FADD interaction is crucial for understanding DISC signalling but has remained unclear largely because of a lack of structural data. We have successfully formed and isolated the human Fas - FADD death domain complex and report the 2.7 angstrom crystal structure. The complex shows a tetrameric arrangement of four FADD death domains bound to four Fas death domains. We show that an opening of the Fas death domain exposes the FADD binding site and simultaneously generates a Fas - Fas bridge. The result is a regulatory Fas - FADD complex bridge governed by weak protein - protein interactions revealing a model where the complex itself functions as a mechanistic switch. This switch prevents accidental DISC assembly, yet allows for highly processive DISC formation and clustering upon a sufficient stimulus. In addition to depicting a previously unknown mode of death domain interactions, these results further uncover a mechanism for receptor signalling solely by oligomerization and clustering events.","[Scott, Fiona L.; Stec, Boguslaw; Pop, Cristina; Dobaczewska, Malgorzata K.; Lee, JeongEun J.; Monosov, Edward; Salvesen, Guy S.; Riedl, Stefan J.] Burnham Inst, Program Apoptosis & Cell Death Res, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; [Robinson, Howard] Brookhaven Natl Lab, Dept Biol, Upton, NY 11973 USA; [Schwarzenbacher, Robert] Salzburg Univ, Dept Mol Biol, A-5020 Salzburg, Austria","Riedl, SJ (reprint author), Burnham Inst, Program Apoptosis & Cell Death Res, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA.",robert.schwarzenbacher@sbg.ac.at; sriedl@burnham.org,,,cancer center grant [P30 CA030199]; Biological and Environmental Research DOE; National Center for Research Resources NIH; LLS scholarship;  [R01AA017238];  [PO1CA69381];  [MCEXT-033534],"We thank S.

NPCs comprise an elaborate scaffold that defines a similar to 30 nm diameter passageway connecting the nucleus and the cytoplasm. This scaffold anchors proteins termed 'phenylalanine- glycine' ( FG)- nucleoporins, the natively disordered domains of which line the passageway and extend into its lumen(1). Passive diffusion through this lined passageway is hindered in a size- dependent manner. However, transport factors and their cargo- bound complexes overcome this restriction by transient binding to the FG-nucleoporins(2-10). To test whether a simple passageway and a lining of transport- factor- binding FG- nucleoporins are sufficient for selective transport, we designed a functionalized membrane that incorporates just these two elements. Here we demonstrate that this membrane functions as a nanoselective filter, efficiently passing transport factors and transport- factor - cargo complexes that specifically bind FG- nucleoporins, while significantly inhibiting the passage of proteins that do not. This inhibition is greatly enhanced when transport factor is present. Determinants of selectivity include the passageway diameter, the length of the nanopore region coated with FG- nucleoporins, the binding strength to FG-nucleoporins, and the antagonistic effect of transport factors on the passage of proteins that do not specifically bind FG- nucleoporins. We show that this artificial system faithfully reproduces key features of trafficking through the NPC, including transport-factor-mediated cargo import.","[Jovanovic-Talisman, Tijana; Chait, Brian T.] Rockefeller Univ, Lab Mass Spect & Gaseous Ion Chem, New York, NY 10065 USA; [Tetenbaum-Novatt, Jaclyn; McKenney, Anna Sophia; Rout, Michael P.] Rockefeller Univ, Lab Cellular & Struct Biol, New York, NY 10065 USA; [Zilman, Anton] Los Alamos Natl Lab, Div Theoret, Theoret Biol & Biophys Grp, Los Alamos, NM 87545 USA; [Zilman, Anton] Los Alamos Natl Lab, Div Theoret, Ctr Nonlinear Studies, Los Alamos, NM 87545 USA; [Peters, Reiner] Univ Munster, Inst Med Phys & Biophys, D-48149 Munster, Germany; [Peters, Reiner] Univ Munster, Ctr Nanotechnol CeNTech, D-48149 Munster, Germany","Chait, BT (reprint author), Rockefeller Univ, Lab Mass Spect & Gaseous Ion Chem, 1230 York Ave, New York, NY 10065 USA.",chait@rockefeller.edu,"Peters, Reiner/E-7352-2011; Novatt, Jaclyn/H-3459-2013","Novatt, Jaclyn/0000-0002-3906-3469; Jovanovic-Talisman, Tijana/0000-0003-1928-4763; Rout, Michael/0000-0003-2010-706X",NIH; DoE,"We thank E.

Individual non- coding RNAs dwarf the number of protein- coding genes, and include classes that are well understood as well as classes for which the nature, extent and functional roles are obscure(1). Deep sequencing of small RNAs (, 200 nucleotides) from human HeLa and HepG2 cells revealed a remarkable breadth of species. These arose both from within annotated genes and from unannotated intergenic regions. Overall, small RNAs tended to align with CAGE ( cap- analysis of gene expression) tags(2), which mark the 5 ' ends of capped, long RNA transcripts. Many small RNAs, including the previously described promoter- associated small RNAs(3), appeared to possess cap structures. Members of an extensive class of both small RNAs and CAGE tags were distributed across internal exons of annotated protein coding and noncoding genes, sometimes crossing exon - exon junctions. Here we show that processing of mature mRNAs through an as yet unknown mechanism may generate complex populations of both long and short RNAs whose apparently capped 5 ' ends coincide. Supplying synthetic promoter- associated small RNAs corresponding to the c-MYC transcriptional start site reduced MYC messenger RNA abundance. The studies presented here expand the catalogue of cellular small RNAs and demonstrate a biological impact for at least one class of non- canonical small RNAs.","[Fejes-Toth, Katalin; Sotirova, Vihra; Sachidanandam, Ravi; Assaf, Gordon; Gingeras, Thomas R.] Cold Spring Harbor Lab, Watson Sch Biol Sci, Cold Spring Harbor, NY 11724 USA; [Fejes-Toth, Katalin; Sotirova, Vihra; Assaf, Gordon; Hannon, Gregory J.] Cold Spring Harbor Lab, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Cold Spring Harbor, NY 11724 USA; [Kapranov, Philipp; Foissac, Sylvain; Willingham, Aarron T.; Duttagupta, Radha; Dumais, Erica; Gingeras, Thomas R.] Affymetrix Inc, Santa Clara, CA 95051 USA","Hannon, GJ (reprint author), Cold Spring Harbor Lab, Watson Sch Biol Sci, 1 Bungtown Rd, Cold Spring Harbor, NY 11724 USA.",hannon@cshl.edu; gingeras@cshl.edu,,"Gingeras, Thomas/0000-0001-9106-3573; Foissac, Sylvain/0000-0002-2631-5356; sachidanandam, ravi/0000-0001-9844-4459",Schering Foundation; NIH,"We thank L.

These recently identified transcripts either exist stably in cells ( stable unannotated transcripts, SUTs) or are rapidly degraded by the RNA surveillance pathway ( cryptic unstable transcripts, CUTs). One characteristic of pervasive transcription is the extensive overlap of SUTs and CUTs with previously annotated features, which prompts questions regarding how these transcripts are generated, and whether they exert function(9). Single- gene studies have shown that transcription of SUTs and CUTs can be functional, through mechanisms involving the generated RNAs(10,11) or their generation itself(12-14). So far, a complete transcriptome architecture including SUTs and CUTs has not been described in any organism. Knowledge about the position and genome- wide arrangement of these transcripts will be instrumental in understanding their function(8,15). Here we provide a comprehensive analysis of these transcripts in the context of multiple conditions, a mutant of the exosome machinery and different strain backgrounds of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We show that both SUTs and CUTs display distinct patterns of distribution at specific locations. Most of the newly identified transcripts initiate from nucleosome- free regions ( NFRs) associated with the promoters of other transcripts ( mostly protein- coding genes), or from NFRs at the 3 ' ends of protein- coding genes. Likewise, about half of all coding transcripts initiate from NFRs associated with promoters of other transcripts. These data change our view of how a genome is transcribed, indicating that bidirectionality is an inherent feature of promoters. Such an arrangement of divergent and overlapping transcripts may provide a mechanism for local spreading of regulatory signals - that is, coupling the transcriptional regulation of neighbouring genes by means of transcriptional interference or histone modification.","[Xu, Zhenyu; Wei, Wu; Gagneur, Julien; Perocchi, Fabiana; Clauder-Muenster, Sandra; Steinmetz, Lars M.] European Mol Biol Lab, D-69117 Heidelberg, Germany; [Camblong, Jurgi] Univ Oxford, Sir William Dunn Sch Pathol, Oxford OX1 3RE, England; [Guffanti, Elisa; Stutz, Francoise] Univ Geneva, Dept Cell Biol, CH-1211 Geneva, Switzerland; [Huber, Wolfgang] European Bioinformat Inst, European Mol Biol Lab, Cambridge CB10 1SD, England","Steinmetz, LM (reprint author), European Mol Biol Lab, Meyerhofstr 1, D-69117 Heidelberg, Germany.",larsms@embl.de,"Stutz, Francoise/N-4329-2017","Huber, Wolfgang/0000-0002-0474-2218; Steinmetz, Lars/0000-0002-3962-2865",National Institutes of Health; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft; SystemsX fellowship; Roche fellowship; SNF; NCCR Frontiers in Genetics,"We thank A.

Cryptic unstable transcripts ( CUTs) were recently described as a principal class of RNA polymerase II transcripts in Saccharomyces cerevisiae(5). These transcripts are targeted for degradation immediately after synthesis by the action of the Nrd1 - exosome - TRAMP complexes(6,7). Although CUT degradation mechanisms have been analysed in detail, the genome- wide distribution at the nucleotide resolution and the prevalence of CUTs are unknown. Here we report the first high- resolution genomic map of CUTs in yeast, revealing a class of potentially functional CUTs and the intrinsic bidirectional nature of eukaryotic promoters. An RNA fraction highly enriched in CUTs was analysed by a 3 ' Long- SAGE ( serial analysis of gene expression) approach adapted to deep sequencing. The resulting detailed genomic map of CUTs revealed that they derive from extremely widespread and very well defined transcription units and do not result from unspecific transcriptional noise. Moreover, the transcription of CUTs predominantly arises within nucleosome- free regions, most of which correspond to promoter regions of bona fide genes. Some of the CUTs start upstream from messenger RNAs and overlap their 59 end. Our study of glycolysis genes, as well as recent results from the literature(8-11), indicate that such concurrent transcription is potentially associated with regulatory mechanisms. Our data reveal numerous new CUTs with such a potential regulatory role. However, most of the identified CUTs corresponded to transcripts divergent from the promoter regions of genes, indicating that they represent by- products of divergent transcription occurring at many and possibly most promoters. Eukaryotic promoter regions are thus intrinsically bidirectional, a fundamental property that escaped previous analyses because in most cases divergent transcription generates short- lived unstable transcripts present at very low steady- state levels.","[Neil, Helen; Malabat, Christophe; Jacquier, Alain] CNRS, Inst Pasteur, Unite Genet Interact Macromol, URA2171, F-75015 Paris, France; [d'Aubenton-Carafa, Yves] CNRS, Ctr Genet Mol, F-91198 Gif Sur Yvette, France; [Xu, Zhenyu; Steinmetz, Lars M.] European Mol Biol Lab, D-69117 Heidelberg, Germany","Jacquier, A (reprint author), CNRS, Inst Pasteur, Unite Genet Interact Macromol, URA2171, F-75015 Paris, France.",alain.jacquier@pasteur.fr,,"Steinmetz, Lars/0000-0002-3962-2865; JACQUIER, ALAIN/0000-0001-5707-9184; Malabat, Christophe/0000-0003-2551-2355",Institut Pasteur; CNRS; ANR (CUT program); European Science Foundation (RNA quality program); National Institutes of Health; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft,"We thank D.

It is the target of our best antibiotics. L- form strains are wall- deficient derivatives of common bacteria that have been studied for decades. However, they are difficult to generate and typically require growth for many generations on osmotically protective media with antibiotics or enzymes that kill walled forms. Despite their potential importance for understanding antibiotic resistance and pathogenesis, little is known about their basic cell biology or their means of propagation. We have developed a controllable system for generating L- forms in the highly tractable model bacterium Bacillus subtilis. Here, using genome sequencing, we identify a single point mutation that predisposes cells to grow without a wall. We show that propagation of L- forms does not require the normal FtsZ- dependent division machine but occurs by a remarkable extrusion- resolution mechanism.

Distant- acting transcriptional enhancers are particularly challenging to uncover because they are scattered among the vast non- coding portion of the genome. Evolutionary sequence constraint can facilitate the discovery of enhancers, but fails to predict when and where they are active in vivo. Here we present the results of chromatin immunoprecipitation with the enhancer- associated protein p300 followed by massively parallel sequencing, and map several thousand in vivo binding sites of p300 in mouse embryonic forebrain, midbrain and limb tissue. We tested 86 of these sequences in a transgenic mouse assay, which in nearly all cases demonstrated reproducible enhancer activity in the tissues that were predicted by p300 binding. Our results indicate that in vivo mapping of p300 binding is a highly accurate means for identifying enhancers and their associated activities, and suggest that such data sets will be useful to study the role of tissue- specific enhancers in human biology and disease on a genome- wide scale.","[Visel, Axel; Blow, Matthew J.; Akiyama, Jennifer A.; Holt, Amy; Plajzer-Frick, Ingrid; Shoukry, Malak; Afzal, Veena; Rubin, Edward M.; Pennacchio, Len A.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Lawrence Berkeley Lab, Genom Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Blow, Matthew J.; Zhang, Tao; Wright, Crystal; Chen, Feng; Rubin, Edward M.; Pennacchio, Len A.] US DOE, Joint Genome Inst, Walnut Creek, CA 94598 USA; [Li, Zirong; Ren, Bing] Univ Calif San Diego, Sch Med, Ludwig Inst Canc Res, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA","Pennacchio, LA (reprint author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Lawrence Berkeley Lab, Genom Div, MS 84-171, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",LAPennacchio@lbl.gov,"Visel, Axel/A-9398-2009; Blow, Matthew/G-6369-2012","Visel, Axel/0000-0002-4130-7784; Blow, Matthew/0000-0002-8844-9149","Berkeley-PGA; National Heart, Lung, & Blood Institute; National Human Genome Research Institute; American Heart Association; Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research","We wish to thank R.

This makes entanglement an essential resource for a number of applications, such as quantum information processing, quantum computing and quantum communications(1,2). The ability to control the transfer of entanglement between different locations will play a key role in these quantum protocols and enable quantum networks(3). Such a transfer requires a system that can delay quantum correlations without significant degradation, effectively acting as a short- term quantum memory. An important benchmark for such systems is the ability to delay Einstein - Podolsky - Rosen ( EPR) levels of entanglement and to be able to tune the delay. EPR entanglement is the basis for a number of quantum protocols, allowing the remote inference of the properties of one system ( to better than its standard quantum limit) through measurements on the other correlated system. Here we show that a four- wave mixing process based on a double- lambda scheme in hot Rb-85 vapour allows us to obtain an optically tunable delay for EPR entangled beams of light. A significant maximum delay, of the order of the width of the cross- correlation function, is achieved. The four- wave mixing also preserves the quantum spatial correlations of the entangled beams. We take advantage of this property to delay entangled images, making this the first step towards a quantum memory for images(4).","[Marino, A. M.; Pooser, R. C.; Boyer, V.; Lett, P.

Controversies have shrouded this element since its discovery was announced in 1808: the new 'element' turned out to be a compound containing less than 60 - 70% of boron, and it was not until 1909 that 99% pure boron was obtained(1). And although we now know of at least 16 polymorphs(2), the stable phase of boron is not yet experimentally established even at ambient conditions(3). Boron's complexities arise from frustration: situated between metals and insulators in the periodic table, boron has only three valence electrons, which would favour metallicity, but they are sufficiently localized that insulating states emerge. However, this subtle balance between metallic and insulating states is easily shifted by pressure, temperature and impurities. Here we report the results of high- pressure experiments and ab initio evolutionary crystal structure predictions(4,5) that explore the structural stability of boron under pressure and, strikingly, reveal a partially ionic high-pressure boron phase. This new phase is stable between 19 and 89 GPa, can be quenched to ambient conditions, and has a hitherto unknown structure ( space group Pnnm, 28 atoms in the unit cell) consisting of icosahedral B(12) clusters and B(2) pairs in a NaCl- type arrangement. We find that the ionicity of the phase affects its electronic bandgap, infrared adsorption and dielectric constants, and that it arises from the different electronic properties of the B(2) pairs and B(12) clusters and the resultant charge transfer between them.","[Oganov, Artem R.; Chen, Jiuhua] SUNY Stony Brook, Dept Geosci, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA; [Oganov, Artem R.; Ma, Yanming; Glass, Colin W.] ETH, Crystallog Lab, Dept Mat, CH-8093 Zurich, Switzerland; [Oganov, Artem R.] Moscow MV Lomonosov State Univ, Dept Geol, Moscow 119992, Russia; [Chen, Jiuhua; Yu, Tony] Florida Int Univ, Ctr Study Matter & Extreme Condit, Miami, FL 33199 USA; [Chen, Jiuhua; Yu, Tony] Florida Int Univ, Dept Mech & Mat Engn, Miami, FL 33199 USA; [Chen, Jiuhua] SUNY Stony Brook, Inst Mineral Phys, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA; [Chen, Jiuhua] SUNY Stony Brook, Dept Geosci, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA; [Gatti, Carlo] CNR, ISTM, I-20133 Milan, Italy; [Ma, Yanzhang] Texas Univ Technol, Dept Mech Engn, Lubbock, TX 79409 USA; [Ma, Yanming] Jilin Univ, Natl Lab Superhard Mat, Changchun 130012, Peoples R China; [Liu, Zhenxian] Carnegie Inst Washington, Geophys Lab, Washington, DC 20015 USA; [Kurakevych, Oleksandr O.; Solozhenko, Vladimir L.] Univ Paris 13, LPMTM, CNRS, F-93430 Villetaneuse, France","Oganov, AR (reprint author), SUNY Stony Brook, Dept Geosci, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA.",artem.oganov@sunysb.edu,"Ma, Yanming/A-7297-2008; Kurakevych, Oleksandr/A-5105-2008; Gatti, Carlo/B-7410-2009; Oganov, Artem/A-1213-2008; Solozhenko, Vladimir/E-1975-2011; Ma, Yanming/A-4982-2009; Glass, Colin/E-2377-2014","Ma, Yanming/0000-0003-3711-0011; Kurakevych, Oleksandr/0000-0002-1249-5325; Gatti, Carlo/0000-0002-0047-1596; Oganov, Artem/0000-0001-7082-9728; Solozhenko, Vladimir/0000-0002-0881-9761; Glass, Colin/0000-0003-0192-1808","Swiss National Science Foundation [200021-111847/1]; ETH Research Equipment Programme; NSF [EAR0711321, DMR-0619215]; DOE [DE-FG02-07ER46461, DE-FC03-03NA00144]; Agence Nationale de la Recherche [ANR-05-BLAN-0141)]; US Department of Energy [DE-AC02-98CH10886]; COMPRES [EAR 06-49658]","A.R.O. acknowledges the Swiss National Science Foundation (grant 200021-111847/1) and the ETH Research Equipment Programme for support of this work.

The success and proliferation of such methods critically rely on the manufacturing of robust and durable master moulds(2). Silicon- based moulds are brittle(3) and have limited longevity(4). Metal moulds are stronger than semiconductors, but patterning of metals on the nano-metre scale is limited by their finite grain size. Amorphous metals ( metallic glasses) exhibit superior mechanical properties and are intrinsically free from grain size limitations. Here we demonstrate direct nanopatterning of metallic glasses by hot embossing, generating feature sizes as small as 13 nm. After subsequently crystallizing the as-formed metallic glass mould, we show that another amorphous sample of the same alloy can be formed on the crystallized mould. In addition, metallic glass replicas can also be used as moulds for polymers or other metallic glasses with lower softening temperatures. Using this 'spawning' process, we can massively replicate patterned surfaces through direct moulding without using conventional lithography. We anticipate that our findings will catalyse the development of micro- and nanoscale metallic glass applications that capitalize on the outstanding mechanical properties, microstructural homogeneity and isotropy, and ease of thermoplastic forming exhibited by these materials(5-7).","[Kumar, Golden; Tang, Hong X.; Schroers, Jan] Yale Univ, New Haven, CT 06511 USA","Schroers, J (reprint author), Yale Univ, New Haven, CT 06511 USA.",jan.schroers@yale.edu,"kumar, golden/F-5443-2010; Tang, Hong/D-1587-2009",,US National Science Foundation,We thank T.

Rifting can eventually lead to rupture of the continental lithosphere and creation of new oceanic lithosphere or, alternatively, lead to formation of wide sedimentary basins around failed rift zones. Conventional models of rift zones include three characteristic features: surface manifestation as an elongated topographic trough, Moho shallowing due to crustal thinning, and reduced seismic velocity in the uppermost mantle due to decompression melting or heating from the Earth's interior(2-4). Here we demonstrate that only the surface manifestation is observed at the Baikal rift zone, whereas the crustal and mantle characteristics can be ruled out by a new seismic profile across southern Lake Baikal in Siberia. Instead we observe a localized zone in the lower crust which has exceptionally high seismic velocity and is highly reflective. We suggest that the expected Moho uplift was compensated by magmatic intrusion into the lower crust, producing the observed high- velocity zone. This finding demonstrates a previously unknown role for magmatism in rifting processes with significant implications for estimation of stretching factors and modelling of sedimentary basins around failed rift structures.","[Thybo, H.; Nielsen, C.

Between these two groups, proteins are virtually identical(1,2), cytogenetically there are few rearrangements that distinguish ape - human chromosomes(3), and rates of single- base- pair change(4-7) and retrotransposon activity(8-10) have slowed particularly within hominid lineages when compared to rodents or monkeys. Studies of gene family evolution indicate that gene loss and gain are enriched within the primate lineage(11,12). Here, we perform a systematic analysis of duplication content of four primate genomes ( macaque, orang- utan, chimpanzee and human) in an effort to understand the pattern and rates of genomic duplication during hominid evolution. We find that the ancestral branch leading to human and African great apes shows the most significant increase in duplication activity both in terms of base pairs and in terms of events. This duplication acceleration within the ancestral species is significant when compared to lineage- specific rate estimates even after accounting for copy- number polymorphism and homoplasy. We discover striking examples of recurrent and independent gene- containing duplications within the gorilla and chimpanzee that are absent in the human lineage. Our results suggest that the evolutionary properties of copy- number mutation differ significantly from other forms of genetic mutation and, in contrast to the hominid slowdown of single- base- pair mutations, there has been a genomic burst of duplication activity at this period during human evolution.","[Marques-Bonet, Tomas; Kidd, Jeffrey M.; Cheng, Ze; Jiang, Zhaoshi; Baker, Carl; Malfavon-Borja, Ray; Alkan, Can; Aksay, Gozde; Girirajan, Santhosh; Siswara, Priscillia; Chen, Lin; Eichler, Evan E.] Univ Washington, Dept Genome Sci, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Marques-Bonet, Tomas; Kidd, Jeffrey M.; Cheng, Ze; Jiang, Zhaoshi; Baker, Carl; Malfavon-Borja, Ray; Alkan, Can; Aksay, Gozde; Girirajan, Santhosh; Siswara, Priscillia; Chen, Lin; Eichler, Evan E.] Howard Hughes Med Inst, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Marques-Bonet, Tomas; Navarro, Arcadi] UPF CSIC, Inst Biol Evolut, Barcelona 08003, Spain; [Ventura, Mario; Cardone, Maria Francesca] Univ Bari, Sez Genet, Dipartimento Anat Patol & Genet, I-70125 Bari, Italy; [Graves, Tina A.; Hillier, LaDeana W.; Fulton, Lucinda A.; Mardis, Elaine R.; Wilson, Richard K.] Washington Univ, Sch Med, Genome Sequencing Ctr, St Louis, MO 63108 USA; [Navarro, Arcadi] ICREA, Barcelona 08003, Spain; [Navarro, Arcadi] INB, Barcelona 08003, Spain","Eichler, EE (reprint author), Univ Washington, Dept Genome Sci, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.",eee@gs.washington.edu,"Alkan, Can/D-2982-2009; Girirajan, Santhosh/A-5280-2010; Ventura, Mario/E-6420-2011; Cardone, Maria Francesca/G-8818-2012; Navarro, Arcadi/F-1592-2011; Marques-Bonet, Tomas/I-4618-2014","Alkan, Can/0000-0002-5443-0706; Ventura, Mario/0000-0001-7762-8777; Cardone, Maria Francesca/0000-0002-7597-7313; Navarro, Arcadi/0000-0003-2162-8246; Marques-Bonet, Tomas/0000-0002-5597-3075; Kidd, Jeffrey/0000-0002-9631-1465","NIH [HG002385, U54 HG003079]; Marie Curie fellowship; Departament d'Educacio i Universitats de la Generalitat de Catalunya; ICREA","We thank H.

The development of much needed specific antiviral therapies and an effective vaccine has been hampered by the lack of a convenient small animal model. The determinants restricting HCV tropism to human and chimpanzee hosts are unknown. Replication of the viral RNA has been demonstrated in mouse cells(1,2), but these cells are not infectable with either lentiviral particles bearing HCV glycoproteins (HCVpp)(3) or HCV produced in cell culture ( HCVcc) ( A. P., M. E. and C. M. R., unpublished observations), suggesting that there is a block at the level of entry. Here we show, using an iterative complementary DNA library screening approach, that human occludin ( OCLN) is an essential HCV cell entry factor that is able to render murine cells infectable with HCVpp. Similarly, OCLN is required for the HCV- susceptibility of human cells, because its overexpression in uninfectable cells specifically enhanced HCVpp uptake, whereas its silencing in permissive cells impaired both HCVpp and HCVcc infection. In addition to OCLN, HCVpp infection of murine cells required expression of the previously identified HCV entry factors CD81 ( ref. 4), scavenger receptor class B type I ( SR- BI, also known as SCARB1) 5 and claudin- 1 (CLDN1)(6). Although the mouse versions of SR- BI and CLDN1 function at least as well as the human proteins in promoting HCV entry, both OCLN and CD81 must be of human origin to allow efficient infection. The species- specific determinants of OCLN were mapped to its second extracellular loop. The identification of OCLN as a new HCV entry factor further highlights the importance of the tight junction complex in the viral entry process, and provides an important advance towards efforts to develop small animal models for HCV.","[Ploss, Alexander; Evans, Matthew J.; Gaysinskaya, Valeriya A.; Panis, Maryline; You, Hana; de Jong, Ype P.; Rice, Charles M.] Rockefeller Univ, Ctr Study Hepatitis C, New York, NY 10065 USA; [de Jong, Ype P.] Mt Sinai Sch Med, Div Gastroenterol, New York, NY 10029 USA","Rice, CM (reprint author), Rockefeller Univ, Ctr Study Hepatitis C, New York, NY 10065 USA.",ricec@rockefeller.edu,,"Evans, Matthew/0000-0002-4991-3877",Greenberg Medical Research Institute; Ellison Medical Foundation; Starr Foundation; Ronald A.

Runx1 is a pivotal transcription factor required for HSC generation in the vascular regions of the mouse conceptus - the aorta, vitelline and umbilical arteries, yolk sac and placenta(1,2). It is thought that HSCs emerge from vascular endothelial cells through the formation of intra-arterial clusters(3) and that Runx1 functions during the transition from 'haemogenic endothelium' to HSCs(4,5). Here we show by conditional deletion that Runx1 activity in vascular- endothelial- cadherin-positive endothelial cells is indeed essential for intra-arterial cluster, haematopoietic progenitor and HSC formation in mice. In contrast, Runx1 is not required in cells expressing Vav1, one of the first pan- haematopoietic genes expressed in HSCs.

A conflicting theory instead associates the first haematopoietic cells with a phenotypically differentiated endothelial cell that has haematopoietic potential ( that is, a haemogenic endothelium) (3-5). Support for the haemangioblast concept was initially provided by the identification during mouse embryonic stem cell differentiation of a clonal precursor, the blast colony- forming cell (BL-CFC), which gives rise to blast colonies with both endothelial and haematopoietic components(6,7). Although recent studies have now provided evidence for the presence of this bipotential precursor in vivo(8,9), the precise mechanism for generation of haematopoietic cells from the haemangioblast still remains completely unknown. Here we demonstrate that the haemangioblast generates haematopoietic cells through the formation of a haemogenic endothelium intermediate, providing the first direct link between these two precursor populations. The cell population containing the haemogenic endothelium is transiently generated during BL-CFC development. This cell population is also present in gastrulating mouse embryos and generates haematopoietic cells on further culture. At the molecular level, we demonstrate that the transcription factor Tal1 ( also known as Scl; ref. 10) is indispensable for the establishment of this haemogenic endothelium population whereas the core binding factor Runx1 ( also known as AML1; ref. 11) is critical for generation of definitive haematopoietic cells from haemogenic endothelium.

Indeed, whether blood cells arise from mesodermal cells, mesenchymal progenitors, bipotent endothelial - haematopoietic precursors or haemogenic endothelial cells remains controversial(2-9). Proximity of endothelial and blood cells at sites of embryonic haematopoiesis, as well as their similar gene expression, led to the hypothesis of the endothelium generating blood. However, owing to lacking technology(10) it has been impossible to observe blood cell emergence continuously at the single- cell level, and the postulated existence of haemogenic endothelial cells remains disputed(1). Here, using new imaging and cell- tracking methods, we show that embryonic endothelial cells can be haemogenic. By continuous long- term single- cell observation of mouse mesodermal cells generating endothelial cell and blood colonies, it was possible to detect haemogenic endothelial cells giving rise to blood cells. Living endothelial and haematopoietic cells were identified by simultaneous detection of morphology and multiple molecular and functional markers. Detachment of nascent blood cells from endothelium is not directly linked to asymmetric cell division, and haemogenic endothelial cells are specified from cells already expressing endothelial markers. These results improve our understanding of the developmental origin of mammalian blood and the potential generation of haematopoietic stem cells from embryonic stem cells.","[Eilken, Hanna M.; Schroeder, Timm] Helmholtz Ctr Munich, German Res Ctr Environm Hlth GmbH, Inst Stem Cell Res, D-85764 Neuherberg, Germany; [Nishikawa, Shin-Ichi] RIKEN, Ctr Dev Biol, Lab Stem Cell Biol, Kobe, Hyogo 6500047, Japan","Schroeder, T (reprint author), Helmholtz Ctr Munich, German Res Ctr Environm Hlth GmbH, Inst Stem Cell Res, D-85764 Neuherberg, Germany.",timm.schroeder@helmholtz-muenchen.de,"Schroeder,  Timm/F-8448-2010","Schroeder,  Timm/0000-0001-9320-0252",Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft; Leading Project for the Realization of Regenerative Medicine,"We are grateful to S.

In migrating cells, calcium has a multifunctional role in directional sensing, cytoskeleton redistribution, traction force generation, and relocation of focal adhesions(1,4) (-7). Here we visualize high- calcium microdomains ('calcium flickers') and their patterned activation in migrating human embryonic lung fibroblasts. Calcium flicker activity is dually coupled to membrane tension ( by means of TRPM7, a stretch-activated Ca2(+)permeant channel of the transient receptor potential superfamily(8)) and chemoattractant signal transduction ( by means of type 2 inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate-receptors). Interestingly, calcium flickers are most active at the leading lamella of migrating cells, displaying a 4: 1 front- to- rear polarization opposite to the global calcium gradient(6). When exposed to a platelet- derived growth factor gradient perpendicular to cell movement, asymmetric calcium flicker activity develops across the lamella and promotes the turning of migrating fibroblasts. These findings show how the exquisite spatiotemporal organization of calcium microdomains can orchestrate complex cellular processes such as cell migration.","[Wei, Chaoliang; Wang, Xianhua; Chen, Min; Ouyang, Kunfu; Cheng, Heping] Peking Univ, Inst Mol Med, State Key Lab Biomembrane & Membrane Biotechnol, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China; [Song, Long-Sheng] Univ Iowa, Carver Coll Med, Div Cardiovasc Med, Dept Internal Med, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA","Cheng, HP (reprint author), Peking Univ, Inst Mol Med, State Key Lab Biomembrane & Membrane Biotechnol, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China.",chaoliang.wei@gmail.com; chengp@pku.edu.cn,"Song, Long-Sheng/D-5899-2012; ouyang, kunfu/B-3073-2011; Wei, Chaoliang/A-9008-2013","ouyang, kunfu/0000-0003-0292-375X; ","Major State Basic Research Development Program of China [2007CB512100]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [30630021, 30800371]; NIH [HL090905]","We thank I.

ABIN-1 (A20 binding and inhibitor of NF-kappa B) is a novel protein that is thought to inhibit NF-kappa B signalling(1,2). Here we show that mice deficient for ABIN-1 die during embryogenesis with fetal liver apoptosis, anaemia and hypoplasia. ABIN-1 deficient cells are hypersensitive to tumour necrosis factor (TNF)induced programmed cell death, and TNF deficiency rescues ABIN-1 deficient embryos. ABIN-1 inhibits caspase 8 recruitment to FADD (Fas-associated death domain-containing protein) in TNF-induced signalling complexes, preventing caspase 8 cleavage and programmed cell death. Moreover, ABIN-1 directly binds polyubiquitin chains and this ubiquitin sensing activity is required for ABIN-1's anti-apoptotic activity.

Deciphering the molecular networks that distinguish organ- confined disease from metastatic disease may lead to the identification of critical biomarkers for cancer invasion and disease aggressiveness. Although gene and protein expression have been extensively profiled in human tumours, little is known about the global metabolomic alterations that characterize neoplastic progression. Using a combination of high- throughput liquid- and- gas- chromatography- based mass spectrometry, we profiled more than 1,126 metabolites across 262 clinical samples related to prostate cancer ( 42 tissues and 110 each of urine and plasma). These unbiased metabolomic profiles were able to distinguish benign prostate, clinically localized prostate cancer and metastatic disease. Sarcosine, an N- methyl derivative of the amino acid glycine, was identified as a differential metabolite that was highly increased during prostate cancer progression to metastasis and can be detected non- invasively in urine. Sarcosine levels were also increased in invasive prostate cancer cell lines relative to benign prostate epithelial cells. Knockdown of glycine- N- methyl transferase, the enzyme that generates sarcosine from glycine, attenuated prostate cancer invasion. Addition of exogenous sarcosine or knockdown of the enzyme that leads to sarcosine degradation, sarcosine dehydrogenase, induced an invasive phenotype in benign prostate epithelial cells. Androgen receptor and the ERG gene fusion product coordinately regulate components of the sarcosine pathway. Here, by profiling the metabolomic alterations of prostate cancer progression, we reveal sarcosine as a potentially important metabolic intermediary of cancer cell invasion and aggressivity.","[Sreekumar, Arun; Rajendiran, Thekkelnaycke M.; Khan, Amjad P.; Cao, Qi; Yu, Jindan; Laxman, Bharathi; Mehra, Rohit; Lonigro, Robert J.; Li, Yong; Kalyana-Sundaram, Shanker; Han, Bo; Cao, Xuhong; Varambally, Sooryanarayana; Beecher, Christopher; Chinnaiyan, Arul M.] Univ Michigan, Sch Med, Michigan Ctr Translat Pathol, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Sreekumar, Arun; Omenn, Gilbert S.; Pennathur, Subramaniam; Beecher, Christopher; Chinnaiyan, Arul M.] Univ Michigan, Sch Med, Ctr Computat Med & Biol, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Sreekumar, Arun; Rajendiran, Thekkelnaycke M.; Khan, Amjad P.; Cao, Qi; Yu, Jindan; Laxman, Bharathi; Mehra, Rohit; Li, Yong; Kalyana-Sundaram, Shanker; Han, Bo; Cao, Xuhong; Varambally, Sooryanarayana; Beecher, Christopher; Chinnaiyan, Arul M.] Univ Michigan, Sch Med, Dept Pathol, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Sreekumar, Arun; Lonigro, Robert J.; Nyati, Mukesh K.; Ghosh, Debashis; Pennathur, Subramaniam; Wei, John T.; Varambally, Sooryanarayana; Chinnaiyan, Arul M.] Univ Michigan, Sch Med, Ctr Comprehens Canc, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Poisson, Laila M.; Ghosh, Debashis] Univ Michigan, Sch Med, Dept Biostat, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Nyati, Mukesh K.; Ahsan, Aarif] Univ Michigan, Sch Med, Dept Radiat Oncol, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Byun, Jaeman; Omenn, Gilbert S.; Pennathur, Subramaniam] Univ Michigan, Sch Med, Dept Internal Med, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Omenn, Gilbert S.] Univ Michigan, Sch Med, Dept Human Genet, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Wei, John T.; Chinnaiyan, Arul M.] Univ Michigan, Sch Med, Dept Urol, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Varambally, Sooryanarayana] Univ Michigan, Sch Med, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Ghosh, Debashis] Penn State Univ, Dept Stat, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Ghosh, Debashis] Penn State Univ, Huck Inst Life Sci, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Alexander, Danny C.; Berger, Alvin; Shuster, Jeffrey R.] Metabolon Inc, Durham, NC 27713 USA","Chinnaiyan, AM (reprint author), Univ Michigan, Sch Med, Michigan Ctr Translat Pathol, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",arul@umich.edu,"Cao, Qi/A-5517-2010; Kalyana-Sundaram, Shanker/F-6860-2012; Wei, John/E-8967-2012","Cao, Qi/0000-0002-5140-3681; Omenn, Gilbert S./0000-0002-8976-6074",Early Detection Research Network; National Institutes of Health; MTTC; Clinical Translational Science Award; Fund for Discovery of the University of Michigan Comprehensive Cancer Center; University of Michigan Cancer Biostatistics Training Grant; Doris Duke Charitable Foundation,"We thank J.

In addition to having excellent charge- transport characteristics in ambient conditions, such materials must meet other key requirements, such as chemical stability, large solubility in common solvents, and inexpensive solution and/or low- temperature processing. Furthermore, compatibility of both p- channel (hole- transporting) and n- channel (electron- transporting) semiconductors with a single combination of gate dielectric and contact materials is highly desirable to enable powerful complementary circuit technologies, where p- and n- channel OTFTs operate in concert. Polymeric complementary circuits operating in ambient conditions are currently difficult to realize: although excellent p- channel polymers are widely available, the achievement of high- performance n- channel polymers is more challenging. Here we report a highly soluble (similar to 60 g l(-1)) and printable n- channel polymer exhibiting unprecedented OTFT characteristics ( electron mobilities up to similar to 0.45 - 0.85 cm(2) V(-1) s(-1)) under ambient conditions in combination with Au contacts and various polymeric dielectrics.

Hexamers have been studied in planar and tubular arrays, but the predicted pentamers have not been observed.

In local examples of extremely luminous galaxies, such as Arp 220, the burst of star formation is concentrated in a relatively small central region of <100 pc radius(7,8). It is not known on which scales stars are forming in active galaxies in the early Universe, at a time when they are probably undergoing their initial burst of star formation. We do know that at some early time, structures comparable to the spheroidal bulge of the Milky Way must have formed. Here we report a spatially resolved image of [CII] emission of the host galaxy of J114816.641525150.3 that demonstrates that its star- forming gas is distributed over a radius of about 750 pc around the centre. The surface density of the star formation rate averaged over this region is similar to 1,000 M. year(-1) kpc-(2). This surface density is comparable to the peak in Arp 220, although about two orders of magnitude larger in area. This vigorous star- forming event is likely to give rise to a massive spheroidal component in this system.","[Walter, Fabian; Riechers, Dominik] Max Planck Inst Astron, D-69117 Heidelberg, Germany; [Riechers, Dominik] CALTECH, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA; [Cox, Pierre; Neri, Roberto] Inst Radio Astron Millimetr, F-38406 St Martin Dheres, France; [Carilli, Chris] Natl Radio Astron Observ, Socorro, NM 87801 USA; [Bertoldi, Frank] Argelander Inst Astron, D-53121 Bonn, Germany; [Weiss, Axel] Max Planck Inst Radioastron, D-53121 Bonn, Germany; [Maiolino, Roberto] Osserv Astron Roma, Ist Nazl Astrofis, I-00040 Monte Porzio Catone, Italy","Walter, F (reprint author), Max Planck Inst Astron, Konigstuhl 17, D-69117 Heidelberg, Germany.",walter@mpia.de,,,MPG (Germany); INSU/CNRS ( France); IGN (Spain); NASA; Hubble Fellowship; Space Telescope Science Institute; Max-Planck Gesellschaft; Alexander von Humboldt Stiftung; Max-Planck-Forschungspreis,"This work is based on observations carried out with the IRAM Plateau de Bure Interferometer.

For spin- based quantum information technology, preparation and read- out of the electron spin state are essential functions(5-13). Coherence of the spin state is a manifestation of its quantum nature, so both the preparation and read- out should be spin- coherent. However, the traditional spin measurement technique based on Kerr rotation, which measures spin population using the rotation of the reflected light polarization that is due to the magneto- optical Kerr effect, requires an extra step of spin manipulation or precession to infer the spin coherence(14-20). Here we describe a technique that generalizes the traditional Kerr rotation approach to enable us to measure the electron spin coherence directly without needing to manipulate the spin dynamics, which allows for a spin projection measurement on an arbitrary set of basis states. Because this technique enables spin state tomography, we call it tomographic Kerr rotation. We demonstrate that the polarization coherence of light is transferred to the spin coherence of electrons, and confirm this by applying the tomographic Kerr rotation method to semiconductor quantum wells with precessing and non- precessing electrons. Spin state transfer and tomography offers a tool for performing basis- independent preparation and read- out of a spin quantum state in a solid.","[Kosaka, Hideo; Inagaki, Takahiro; Mitsumori, Yasuyoshi; Edamatsu, Keiichi] Tohoku Univ, Lab Nanoelect & Spintron, Res Inst Elect Commun, Sendai, Miyagi 9808577, Japan; [Kosaka, Hideo; Rikitake, Yoshiaki; Imamura, Hiroshi; Mitsumori, Yasuyoshi] CREST JST, Kawaguchi, Saitama 3320012, Japan; [Rikitake, Yoshiaki] Sendai Natl Coll Technol, Dept Informat Engn, Sendai, Miyagi 9893128, Japan; [Imamura, Hiroshi] AIST, Nanotechnol Res Inst, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058568, Japan","Kosaka, H (reprint author), Tohoku Univ, Lab Nanoelect & Spintron, Res Inst Elect Commun, Sendai, Miyagi 9808577, Japan.",kosaka@riec.tohoku.ac.jp,"Imamura, Hiroshi/O-5748-2016",,Strategic Information and Communications R & D Promotion Program; Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications in Japan;  [SCOPE 41402001],This work was supported in part by the Strategic Information and Communications R & D Promotion Program (SCOPE No. 41402001) of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications in Japan.,,25,59,59,2,27,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,5-Feb,2009,457,7230,,,,,702,705,,10.1038/nature07729,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,403EA,WOS:000263064700036,19194446,No,,,11/20/17

Here we report the direct synthesis of large- scale graphene films using chemical vapour deposition on thin nickel layers, and present two different methods of patterning the films and transferring them to arbitrary substrates. The transferred graphene films show very low sheet resistance of similar to 280 Omega per square, with 80 per cent optical transparency. At low temperatures, the monolayers transferred to silicon dioxide substrates show electron mobility greater than 3,700 cm(2) V(-1) s(-1) and exhibit the half- integer quantum Hall effect(4,5), implying that the quality of graphene grown by chemical vapour deposition is as high as mechanically cleaved graphene(6).

Through its attendant meridional heat transport, the AMOC helps maintain a warm northwestern European climate, and acts as a control on the global climate. Past climate fluctuations during the Holocene epoch (similar to 11,700 years ago to the present) have been linked with changes in North Atlantic Ocean circulation(1,2). The behaviour of the surface flowing salty water that helped drive overturning during past climatic changes is, however, not well known. Here we investigate the temperature and salinity changes of a substantial surface inflow to a region of deep- water formation throughout the Holocene. We find that the inflow has undergone millennial- scale variations in temperature and salinity ( similar to 3.5 degrees C and similar to 1.5 practical salinity units, respectively) most probably controlled by subpolar gyre dynamics. The temperature and salinity variations correlate with previously reported periods of rapid climate change(3). The inflow becomes more saline during enhanced freshwater flux to the subpolar North Atlantic. Model studies predict a weakening of AMOC in response to enhanced Arctic freshwater fluxes(4), although the inflow can compensate on decadal timescales by becoming more saline(5). Our data suggest that such a negative feedback mechanism may have operated during past intervals of climate change.","[Thornalley, David J. R.; Elderfield, Harry; McCave, I.

Very little is known about ancient tropical terrestrial ecosystems, limiting our understanding of the evolution of giant snakes and their relationship to climate in the past. Here we describe a boid snake from the oldest known neotropical rainforest fauna from the Cerrejon Formation ( 58 - 60 Myr ago) in northeastern Colombia. We estimate a body length of 13 and a mass of 1,135 kg, making it the largest known snake(6-9). The maximum size of poikilothermic animals at a given temperature is limited by metabolic rate(4), and a snake of this size would require a minimum mean annual temperature of 30 - 34 degrees C to survive. This estimate is consistent with hypotheses of hot Palaeocene neotropics with high concentrations of atmospheric CO(2) based on climate models(10). Comparison of palaeotemperature estimates from the equator to those from South American mid- latitudes indicates a relatively steep temperature gradient during the early Palaeogene greenhouse, similar to that of today. Depositional environments and faunal composition of the Cerrejon Formation indicate an anaconda- like ecology for the giant snake, and an earliest Cenozoic origin of neotropical vertebrate faunas.","[Head, Jason J.] Univ Toronto, Dept Biol, Mississauga, ON L5L 1C6, Canada; [Bloch, Jonathan I.; Hastings, Alexander K.; Bourque, Jason R.; Cadena, Edwin A.; Herrera, Fabiany A.] Univ Florida, Florida Museum Nat Hist, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [Cadena, Edwin A.; Herrera, Fabiany A.; Jaramillo, Carlos A.] Smithsonian Trop Res Inst, Balboa, Panama; [Polly, P.

These sterane biomarkers are abundant in all formations of the Huqf Supergroup, South Oman Salt Basin, and, based on a new high-precision geochronology(2), constitute a continuous 100- Myr- long chemical fossil record of demosponges through the terminal Neoproterozoic and into the Early Cambrian epoch. The demosponge steranes occur in strata that underlie the Marinoan cap carbonate ( > 635 Myr ago). They currently represent the oldest evidence for animals in the fossil record, and are evidence for animals pre- dating the termination of the Marinoan glaciation. This suggests that shallow shelf waters in some late Cryogenian ocean basins (> 635 Myr ago) contained dissolved oxygen in concentrations sufficient to support basal metazoan life at least 100 Myr before the rapid diversification of bilaterians during the Cambrian explosion.

In mammals, two regimens of dietary restriction, intermittent fasting ( IF) and chronic caloric restriction, have proven to extend lifespan and reduce the incidence of age- related disorders(2). An important characteristic of IF is that it can increase lifespan even when there is little or no overall decrease in calorie intake(2). The molecular mechanisms underlying IF- induced longevity, however, remain largely unknown. Here we establish an IF regimen that effectively extends the lifespan of Caenorhabditis elegans, and show that the low molecular weight GTPase RHEB- 1 has a dual role in lifespan regulation; RHEB- 1 is required for the IF- induced longevity, whereas inhibition of RHEB- 1 mimics the caloric- restriction effects. RHEB- 1 exerts its effects in part by the insulin/ insulin growth factor ( IGF)- like signalling effector DAF- 16 in IF. Our analyses demonstrate that most fasting- induced upregulated genes require RHEB- 1 function for their induction, and that RHEB- 1 and TOR signalling are required for the fasting- induced downregulation of an insulin- like peptide, INS- 7. These findings identify the essential role of signalling by RHEB- 1 in IF- induced longevity and gene expression changes, and suggest a molecular link between the IF- induced longevity and the insulin/ IGF- like signalling pathway.","[Honjoh, Sakiko; Yamamoto, Takuya; Uno, Masaharu; Nishida, Eisuke] Kyoto Univ, Dept Cell & Dev Biol, Grad Sch Biostudies, Sakyo Ku, Kyoto 6068502, Japan","Nishida, E (reprint author), Kyoto Univ, Dept Cell & Dev Biol, Grad Sch Biostudies, Sakyo Ku, Kyoto 6068502, Japan.",L50174@sakura.kudpc.kyoto-u.ac.jp,"Yamamoto, Takuya/H-2792-2017","Yamamoto, Takuya/0000-0002-0022-3947","Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology of Japan; NIH National Center for Research Resources","We thank members of our laboratory for technical comments and helpful discussion.

Like many other intracellular pathogens, C. trachomatis has a marked requirement for host cell lipids, such as sphingolipids and cholesterol, produced in the endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi apparatus(4-6). However, the mechanisms by which intracellular pathogens acquire host cell lipids are not well understood(1-3). In particular, no host cell protein responsible for transporting Golgi-derived lipids to the chlamydial inclusions has yet been identified. Here we show that Chlamydia infection in human epithelial cells induces Golgi fragmentation to generate Golgi ministacks surrounding the bacterial inclusion. Ministack formation is triggered by the proteolytic cleavage of the Golgimatrix protein golgin-84. Inhibition of golgin-84 truncation prevents Golgi fragmentation, causing a block in lipid acquisition and maturation of C. trachomatis. Golgi fragmentation by means of RNA- interference- mediated knockdown of distinct Golgi matrix proteins before infection enhances bacterial maturation. Our data functionally connect bacteria- induced golgin-84 cleavage, Golgi ministack formation, lipid acquisition and intracellular pathogen growth. We show that C. trachomatis subverts the structure and function of an entire host cell organelle for its own advantage.","[Heuer, Dagmar; Lipinski, Anette Rejman; Machuy, Nikolaus; Karlas, Alexander; Wehrens, Andrea; Meyer, Thomas F.] Max Planck Inst Infect Biol, Dept Mol Biol, D-10117 Berlin, Germany; [Brinkmann, Volker] Max Planck Inst Infect Biol, Microscopy Core Facil, D-10117 Berlin, Germany; [Siedler, Frank] Max Planck Inst Biochem, Dept Membrane Biochem, D-82152 Martinsried, Germany","Meyer, TF (reprint author), Max Planck Inst Infect Biol, Dept Mol Biol, Charitepl 1, D-10117 Berlin, Germany.",meyer@mpiib-berlin.mpg.de,"Brinkmann, Volker/A-6015-2009; Meyer, Thomas F./J-2485-2013","Meyer, Thomas F./0000-0002-6120-8679",Senate of Berlin; BMBF,"The authors would like to thank A.

ER stress is sensed by Ire1, a transmembrane kinase/ endoribonuclease, which initiates the non- conventional splicing of the messenger RNA encoding a key transcription activator, Hac1 in yeast or XBP1 in metazoans. In the absence of ER stress, ribosomes are stalled on unspliced HAC1 mRNA. The translational control is imposed by a base- pairing interaction between the HAC1 intron and the HAC1 5' untranslated region(4). After excision of the intron, transfer RNA ligase joins the severed exons(5,6), lifting the translational block and allowing synthesis of Hac1 from the spliced HAC1 mRNA to ensue(4). Hac1 in turn drives the UPR gene expression program comprising 7-8% of the yeast genome(7) to counteract ER stress. Here we show that, on activation, Ire1 molecules cluster in the ER membrane into discrete foci of higher- order oligomers, to which unspliced HAC1 mRNA is recruited by means of a conserved bipartite targeting element contained in the 3' untranslated region. Disruption of either Ire1 clustering or HAC1 mRNA recruitment impairs UPR signalling. The HAC1 3' untranslated region element is sufficient to target other mRNAs to Ire1 foci, as long as their translation is repressed. Translational repression afforded by the intron fulfils this requirement for HAC1 mRNA. Recruitment of mRNA to signalling centres provides a new paradigm for the control of eukaryotic gene expression.","[Aragon, Tomas; van Anken, Eelco; Pincus, David; Serafimova, Iana M.; Korennykh, Alexei V.; Rubio, Claudia A.; Walter, Peter] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Biochem & Biophys, San Francisco, CA 94158 USA; [Aragon, Tomas; van Anken, Eelco; Pincus, David; Serafimova, Iana M.; Korennykh, Alexei V.; Rubio, Claudia A.; Walter, Peter] Univ Calif San Francisco, Howard Hughes Med Inst, San Francisco, CA 94158 USA","Aragon, T (reprint author), Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Biochem & Biophys, San Francisco, CA 94158 USA.",Tomas.Aragon@ucsf.edu,,"van Anken, Eelco/0000-0001-9529-2701",Basque Foundation for Science; Howard Hughes Medical Institute; Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO); National Science Foundation; President's Dissertation Year Fellowship; Jane Childs Memorial Fund for Medical Research,"We thank M.

These include peptides, such as substance P and neurotensin, as well as acetylcholine and noradrenaline. Unlike the fast ( approximately millisecond) ionotropic actions of small- molecule neurotransmitters, the slow excitation is not well understood at themolecular level, but can be mainly attributed to suppressing K+ currents and/or activating a nonselective cation channel(3-9). The molecular identity of this cation channel has yet to be determined; similarly, how the channel is activated and its relative contribution to neuronal excitability induced by the neuropeptides are unknown. Here we show that, in the mouse hippocampal and ventral tegmental area neurons, substance P and neurotensin activate a channel complex containing NALCN and a large previously unknown protein UNC-80. The activation by substance P through TACR1 (a G- protein- coupled receptor for substance P) occurs by means of a unique mechanism: it does not require G- protein activation but is dependent on Src family kinases. These findings identify NALCN as the cation channel activated by substance P receptor, and suggest that UNC- 80 and Src family kinases, rather than a G protein, are involved in the coupling from receptor to channel.","[Lu, Boxun; Su, Yanhua; Das, Sudipto; Wang, Haikun; Wang, Yan; Liu, Jin; Ren, Dejian] Univ Penn, Dept Biol, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA","Ren, DJ (reprint author), Univ Penn, Dept Biol, 415 S University Ave, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",dren@sas.upenn.edu,,,American Heart Association; NIH; University of Pennsylvania Research Foundation,"We thank D.

This nucleoprotein filament recognizes and invades a homologous duplex DNA segment(1,2). After strand exchange, the nucleoprotein filament should disassemble so that the recombination process can be completed(3). The molecular mechanism of RAD51 filament disassembly is poorly understood. Here we show, by combining optical tweezers with single- molecule fluorescence microscopy and microfluidics(4,5), that disassembly of human RAD51 nucleoprotein filaments results from the interplay between ATP hydrolysis and the release of the tension stored in the filament. By applying external tension to the DNA, we found that disassembly slows down and can even be stalled. We quantified the fluorescence of RAD51 patches and found that disassembly occurs in bursts interspersed by long pauses. After relaxation of a stalled complex, pauses were suppressed resulting in a large burst. These results indicate that tension- dependent disassembly takes place only from filament ends, after tension- independent ATP hydrolysis. This integrative single-molecule approach allowed us to dissect the mechanism of this principal homologous recombination reaction step, which in turn clarifies how disassembly can be influenced by accessory proteins.","[van Mameren, Joost; Peterman, Erwin J.

Genetic recombination is largely confined to about one- third of the sorghum genome with gene order and density similar to those of rice. Retrotransposon accumulation in recombinationally recalcitrant heterochromatin explains the similar to 75% larger genome size of sorghum compared with rice. Although gene and repetitive DNA distributions have been preserved since palaeopolyploidization similar to 70 million years ago, most duplicated gene sets lost one member before the sorghum - rice divergence. Concerted evolution makes one duplicated chromosomal segment appear to be only a few million years old. About 24% of genes are grass- specific and 7% are sorghum- specific.

Although natural killer (NK) cells have traditionally been classified as cells of the innate immune system, they share many similarities with cytotoxic T lymphocytes. We use a mouse model of cytomegalovirus infection to show that, like T cells, NK cells bearing the virus-specific Ly49H receptor proliferate 100-fold in the spleen and 1,000- fold in the liver after infection. After a contraction phase, Ly49H- positive NK cells reside in lymphoid and non- lymphoid organs for several months. These self- renewing 'memory' NK cells rapidly degranulate and produce cytokines on reactivation. Adoptive transfer of these NK cells into naive animals followed by viral challenge results in a robust secondary expansion and protective immunity.

These planets display a wide diversity of properties, yet all are believed to have had their spin periods tidally spin- synchronized with their orbital periods, resulting in permanent star- facing hemispheres and surface flow patterns that are most likely in equilibrium. Planets in significantly eccentric orbits can enable direct measurements of global heating that are largely independent of the details of the hydrodynamic flow(6). Here we report 8-mu m photometric observations of the planet HD 80606b during a 30- hour interval bracketing the periastron passage of its extremely eccentric 111.4- day orbit. As the planet received its strongest irradiation ( 828 times larger than the flux received at apastron) its maximum 8- mm brightness temperature increased from 800 K to 1,500K over a six- hour period. We also detected a secondary eclipse for the planet, which implies an orbital inclination of i approximate to 90 degrees, fixes the planetary mass at four times the mass of Jupiter, and constrains the planet's tidal luminosity. Our measurement of the global heating rate indicates that the radiative time constant at the planet's 8- mu m photosphere is similar to 4.5 h, in comparison with 3 - 5 days in Earth's stratosphere(7).","[Laughlin, Gregory; Langton, Jonathan; Kasen, Daniel; Vogt, Steve; Rivera, Eugenio; Meschiari, Stefano] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Univ Calif Observ, Lick Observ, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA; [Deming, Drake] NASA, Goddard Space Flight Ctr, Planetary Syst Branch, Greenbelt, MD 20771 USA; [Butler, Robert Paul] Carnegie Inst Sci, Dept Terr Magnetism, Washington, DC 20015 USA","Laughlin, G (reprint author), Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Univ Calif Observ, Lick Observ, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA.",laughlin@ucolick.org,"Butler, Robert/B-1125-2009","Meschiari, Stefano/0000-0002-2930-0416",NASA,"We thank P.

The copper oxides have layered crystal structures with quasi- two- dimensional electronic properties, which led to speculation that reduced dimensionality ( that is, extreme anisotropy) is a necessary prerequisite for superconductivity at temperatures above 40 K ( refs 8, 9). Early work on the iron- arsenic compounds seemed to support this view(7,10). Here we report measurements of the electrical resistivity in single crystals of (Ba,K)Fe2As2 in a magnetic field up to 60 T. We find that the superconducting properties are in fact quite isotropic, being rather independent of the direction of the applied magnetic fields at low temperature. Such behaviour is strikingly different from all previously known layered superconductors(9,11), and indicates that reduced dimensionality in these compounds is not a prerequisite for 'high- temperature' superconductivity. We suggest that this situation arises because of the underlying electronic structure of the iron- arsenic compounds, which appears to be much more three dimensional than that of the copper oxides. Extrapolations of low- field single- crystal data incorrectly suggest a high anisotropy and a greatly exaggerated zero- temperature upper critical field.","[Yuan, H.

Electron density waves have been observed in many families of superconductors(1-3), and are often considered to be essential for superconductivity to exist(4). Recent measurements(5-9) seem to show that the properties of the iron pnictides(10,11) are in good agreement with band structure calculations that do not include additional ordering, implying no relation between density waves and superconductivity in these materials(12-15).

Among the various toxins isolated that contribute to these poisonings(2,3), the chlorosulpholipids are particularly intriguing because of their structural and stereochemical complexity(4-12). The mechanism of biological activity remains unknown and, although chlorosulpholipids are associated with membranes in the organisms from which they are isolated, little is understood about their role within biological membranes. The lack of availability of the natural products has impaired more in-depth biochemical studies. So far, none of the chlorosulpholipids have been obtained from total synthesis, and efficient routes to their synthesis would be desirable for the preparation ofmaterial for pharmacological characterization and proper evaluation of the risk to human health. Despite the notable advances in the science of organic synthesis, reliable methods for stereoselective construction of polychlorinated acyclic substrates are lacking, although some preliminary investigations have appeared(13-15). Here we report the synthesis of a chlorosulpholipid cytotoxin, leading to confirmation of the proposed structure and the discovery of unanticipated reactivity of polychlorinated hydrocarbons. The concise synthetic approach should enable the preparation of material in sufficient quantities to facilitate biological studies.","[Nilewski, Christian; Geisser, Roger W.; Carreira, Erick M.] ETH, Organ Chem Lab, CH-8093 Zurich, Switzerland","Carreira, EM (reprint author), ETH, Organ Chem Lab, CH-8093 Zurich, Switzerland.",carreira@org.chem.ethz.ch,,"Carreira, Erick/0000-0003-1472-490X",Swiss National Science Foundation; ETH Zurich; F.

Carbon export from the surface layer and, in particular, the ability of the ocean and sediments to sequester carbon for many years remains, however, poorly quantified(3). Here we report data from the CROZEX experiment(4) in the Southern Ocean, which was conducted to test the hypothesis that the observed north - south gradient in phytoplankton concentrations in the vicinity of the Crozet Islands is induced by natural iron fertilization that results in enhanced organic carbon flux to the deep ocean. We report annual particulate carbon fluxes out of the surface layer, at three kilometres below the ocean surface and to the ocean floor. We find that carbon fluxes from a highly productive, naturally iron-fertilized region of the sub- Antarctic Southern Ocean are two to three times larger than the carbon fluxes from an adjacent high-nutrient, low- chlorophyll area not fertilized by iron. Our findings support the hypothesis that increased iron supply to the glacial sub- Antarctic may have directly enhanced carbon export to the deep ocean(5). The CROZEX sequestration efficiency(6) ( the amount of carbon sequestered below the depth of winter mixing for a given iron supply) of 8,600 mol mol(-1) was 18 times greater than that of a phytoplankton bloom induced artificially by adding iron(7), but 77 times smaller than that of another bloom(8) initiated, like CROZEX, by a natural supply of iron. Large losses of purposefully added iron can explain the lower efficiency of the induced bloom(6). The discrepancy between the blooms naturally supplied with iron may result in part from an underestimate of horizontal iron supply.","[Pollard, Raymond T.; Salter, Ian; Sanders, Richard J.; Moore, C.

Eutrophication of these waters, due to human activity, leads to severe oxygen depletion and the episodic occurrence of hydrogen sulphide toxic to multi- cellular life - with disastrous consequences for coastal ecosytems(2-5). Here we show that an area of similar to 7,000 km(2) of African shelf, covered by sulphidic water, was detoxified by blooming bacteria that oxidized the biologically harmful sulphide to environmentally harmless colloidal sulphur and sulphate. Combined chemical analyses, stoichiometric modelling, isotopic incubations, comparative 16S ribosomal RNA, functional gene sequence analyses and fluorescence in situ hybridization indicate that the detoxification proceeded by chemolithotrophic oxidation of sulphide with nitrate and was mainly catalysed by two discrete populations of gamma- and epsilon-proteobacteria. Chemolithotrophic bacteria, accounting for similar to 20 per cent of the bacterioplankton in sulphidic waters, created a buffer zone between the toxic sulphidic subsurface waters and the oxic surface waters, where fish and other nekton live. This is the first time that large- scale detoxification of sulphidic waters by chemolithotrophs has been observed in an open- ocean system. The data suggest that sulphide can be completely consumed by bacteria in the subsurface waters and, thus, can be overlooked by remote sensing or monitoring of shallow coastal waters. Consequently, sulphidic bottom waters on continental shelves may be more common than previously believed, and could therefore have an important but as yet neglected effect on benthic communities.","[Lavik, Gaute; Stuehrmann, Torben; Bruechert, Volker; Lam, Phyllis; Fuchs, Bernhard M.; Amann, Rudolf; Kuypers, Marcel M.

Although the proteins targeted by aeroallergic responses represent a tiny fraction of the airborne proteins humans are exposed to, allergenicity is a quite public phenomenon - the same proteins typically behave as aeroallergens across the human population. Why particular proteins tend to act as allergens in susceptible hosts is a fundamental mechanistic question that remains largely unanswered. The main house- dust- mite allergen, Der p 2, has structural homology with MD- 2 ( also known as LY96), the lipopolysaccharide ( LPS)- binding component of the Toll- like receptor ( TLR) 4 signalling complex(2-4). Here we show that Der p 2 also has functional homology, facilitating signalling through direct interactions with the TLR4 complex, and reconstituting LPS- driven TLR4 signalling in the absence of MD- 2. Mirroring this, airway sensitization and challenge with Der p 2 led to experimental allergic asthma in wild type and MD- 2- deficient, but not TLR4- deficient, mice. Our results indicate that Der p 2 tends to be targeted by adaptive immune responses because of its auto-adjuvant properties. The fact that other members of the MD- 2- like lipid- binding family are allergens, and that most defined major allergens are thought to be lipid- binding proteins(5), suggests that intrinsic adjuvant activity by such proteins and their accompanying lipid cargo may have some generality as a mechanism underlying the phenomenon of allergenicity.","[Trompette, Aurelien; Divanovic, Senad; Madan, Rajat; Karp, Christopher L.] Childrens Hosp, Med Ctr, Div Mol Immunol, Cincinnati, OH 45229 USA; [Blanchard, Carine] Childrens Hosp, Med Ctr, Div Allergy & Immunol, Cincinnati, OH 45229 USA; [Hegde, Rashmi S.] Childrens Hosp, Med Ctr, Div Dev Biol, Cincinnati, OH 45229 USA; [Wills-Karp, Marsha] Childrens Hosp, Med Ctr, Div Immunobiol, Cincinnati, OH 45229 USA; Univ Cincinnati, Coll Med, Cincinnati, OH 45229 USA; [Visintin, Alberto] Univ Massachusetts, Sch Med, Div Infect Dis & Immunol, Dept Med, Worcester, MA 01606 USA; [Thorne, Peter S.] Univ Iowa, Dept Occupat & Environm Med, Iowa City, IA 52241 USA; [Gioannini, Theresa L.; Weiss, Jerry P.] Univ Iowa, Inflammat Program, Dept Internal Med, Iowa City, IA 52241 USA; [Gioannini, Theresa L.; Weiss, Jerry P.] Vet Affairs Med Ctr, Iowa City, IA 52247 USA","Karp, CL (reprint author), Childrens Hosp, Med Ctr, Div Mol Immunol, Cincinnati, OH 45229 USA.",chris.karp@chmcc.org,,"Karp, Christopher/0000-0002-0832-2659",Sandler Foundation for Asthma Research; National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases; Veteran's Administration,"We thank S.

How myofibres acquire their orientation during development is unknown. Here we show that during early chick myogenesis WNT11 has an essential role in the oriented elongation of the myocytes. We find that the neural tube, known to drive WNT11 expression in the medial border of somites(1), is necessary and sufficient to orient myocyte elongation. We then show that the specific inhibition of WNT11 function in somites leads to the disorganization of myocytes. We establish that WNT11 mediates this effect through the evolutionary conserved planar cell polarity ( PCP) pathway, downstream of the WNT/beta-catenin-dependent pathway, required to initiate the myogenic program of myocytes and WNT11 expression. Finally, we demonstrate that a localized ectopic source of WNT11 can markedly change the orientation of myocytes, indicating that WNT11 acts as a directional cue in this process. All together, these data show that the sequential action of the WNT/ PCP and the WNT/beta-catenin pathways is necessary for the formation of fully functional embryonic muscle fibres. This study also provides evidence that WNTs can act as instructive cues to regulate the PCP pathway in vertebrates.","[Gros, Jerome; Serralbo, Olivier; Marcelle, Christophe] Univ Aix Marseille 2, CNRS, Dev Biol Inst Marseille Luminy IBDML, UMR 6216, F-13288 Marseille 09, France","Marcelle, C (reprint author), Univ Aix Marseille 2, CNRS, Dev Biol Inst Marseille Luminy IBDML, UMR 6216, Campus Luminy,Case 907, F-13288 Marseille 09, France.",marcelle@ibdm.univ-mrs.fr,,"Gros, Jerome/0000-0002-2264-2851",Actions Concertees Incitatives; Agence Nationale de la Recherche; Association Francaise contre les Myopathies; EU 6th Framework Programme Network of Excellence MYORES,"We thank C.

Many flagellated pathogens export putative adhesins belonging to the two- partner secretion ( TPS) family(5). However, the actual function of these adhesins remains largely undefined. Here we demonstrate that EtpA, a TPS exoprotein adhesin of enterotoxigenic E. coli(6), mimics and interacts with highly conserved regions of flagellin, the major subunit of flagella, and that these interactions are critical for adherence and intestinal colonization. Although conserved regions of flagellin are mostly buried in the flagellar shaft(7), our results suggest that they are at least transiently exposed at the tips of flagella where they capture EtpA adhesin molecules for presentation to eukaryotic receptors. Similarity of EtpA to molecules encoded by other motile pathogens suggests a potential common pattern for bacterial adhesion, whereas participation of conserved regions of flagellin in adherence has implications for development of vaccines for Gram- negative pathogens.","[Roy, Koushik; Luo, Jiwen; Fleckenstein, James M.] Univ Tennessee, Ctr Hlth Sci, Dept Med, Memphis, TN 38163 USA; [Hilliard, George M.; Fleckenstein, James M.] Univ Tennessee, Ctr Hlth Sci, Dept Mol Sci, Memphis, TN 38163 USA; [Hamilton, David J.] Univ Tennessee, Ctr Hlth Sci, Dept Comparat Med, Memphis, TN 38163 USA; [Ostmann, Marguerite M.] Vet Adm Med Ctr, Res Serv, Memphis, TN 38104 USA; [Fleckenstein, James M.] Vet Adm Med Ctr, Med Serv, Memphis, TN 38104 USA","Fleckenstein, JM (reprint author), Univ Tennessee, Ctr Hlth Sci, Dept Med, 956 Court Ave, Memphis, TN 38163 USA.",jflecke1@tennessee.edu,,"Fleckenstein, James/0000-0002-1148-697X",National Institutes of Health (National Center for Research Resources) [RR16190-05]; Department of Veterans Affairs; University of Tennessee Microbial Pathogenesis Research Center,"We thank B.

However, BRAF and NRAS mutations are absent in a number of other melanocytic neoplasms in which the equivalent oncogenic events are currently unknown(3). Here we report frequent somatic mutations in the heterotrimeric G protein alpha-subunit, GNAQ, in blue naevi (83%) and ocular melanoma of the uvea ( 46%). The mutations occur exclusively in codon 209 in the Ras- like domain and result in constitutive activation, turning GNAQ into a dominant acting oncogene.

What remains unclear is whether cancer stem cells are the direct progeny of mutated stem cells or more mature cells that reacquire stem cell properties during tumour formation. Answering this question will require knowledge of whether normal stem cells are susceptible to cancer- causing mutations; however, this has proved difficult to test because the identity of most adult tissue stem cells is not known. Here, using an inducible Cre, nuclear LacZ reporter allele knocked into the Prom1 locus (Prom1(C-L)), we show that Prom1 is expressed in a variety of developing and adult tissues. Lineage- tracing studies of adult Prom1(+/C-L) mice containing the Rosa26-YFP reporter allele showed that Prom1(+) cells are located at the base of crypts in the small intestine, co- express Lgr5 ( ref. 2), generate the entire intestinal epithelium, and are therefore the small intestinal stem cell. Prom1 was reported recently to mark cancer stem cells of human intestinal tumours that arise frequently as a consequence of aberrant wingless ( Wnt) signalling(3-5). Activation of endogenous Wnt signalling in Prom1(+/C-L) mice containing a Cre- dependent mutant allele of beta-catenin (Ctnnb1(lox(ex3))) resulted in a gross disruption of crypt architecture and a disproportionate expansion of Prom1(+) cells at the crypt base. Lineage tracing demonstrated that the progeny of these cells replaced the mucosa of the entire small intestine with neoplastic tissue that was characterized by focal high- grade intraepithelial neoplasia and crypt adenoma formation. Although all neoplastic cells arose from Prom1(+) cells in these mice, only 7% of tumour cells retained Prom1 expression. Our data indicate that Prom1 marks stem cells in the adult small intestine that are susceptible to transformation into tumours retaining a fraction of mutant Prom1(+) tumour cells.","[Zhu, Liqin; Gibson, Paul; Currle, D.

As in most cancers, the cell of origin has remained elusive. In a previously established Lgr5 ( leucine- rich- repeat containing G- protein-coupled receptor 5) knockin mouse model, a tamoxifen- inducible Cre recombinase is expressed in long- lived intestinal stem cells(1). Here we show that deletion of Apc in these stem cells leads to their transformation within days. Transformed stem cells remain located at crypt bottoms, while fuelling a growing microadenoma. These microadenomas show unimpeded growth and develop into macroscopic adenomas within 3-5 weeks. The distribution of Lgr5(+) cells within stem- cell- derived adenomas indicates that a stem cell/ progenitor cell hierarchy is maintained in early neoplastic lesions. When Apc is deleted in short- lived transit- amplifying cells using a different cre mouse, the growth of the induced microadenomas rapidly stalls. Even after 30 weeks, large adenomas are very rare in these mice. We conclude that stem- cell- specific loss of Apc results in progressively growing neoplasia.","[Barker, Nick; van Es, Johan H.; van de Wetering, Marc; Begthel, Harry; van den Born, Maaike; Danenberg, Esther; Clevers, Hans] Hubrecht Inst Dev Biol & Stem Cell Res, NL-3584 CT Utrecht, Netherlands; Univ Med Ctr Utrecht, NL-3584 CT Utrecht, Netherlands; [Ridgway, Rachel A.; Sansom, Owen J.] Beatson Inst Canc Res, Glasgow G61 1BD, Lanark, Scotland; [Clarke, Alan R.] Cardiff Sch Biosci, Cardiff CF10 3US, Wales","Clevers, H (reprint author), Hubrecht Inst Dev Biol & Stem Cell Res, Uppsalalaan 8, NL-3584 CT Utrecht, Netherlands.",h.clevers@niob.knaw.nl,"Clarke, Alan/A-6256-2008; Barker, Nick/A-5535-2011; clarke, alan/P-2820-2014","Clarke, Alan/0000-0002-4281-426X; Sansom, Owen J./0000-0001-9540-3010",Cancer Research UK; KWF program [PF-HUBR-2007-3956],"We thank M.

Analysis of the cellular response to acute high-dose exposure has delineated the importance of direct DNA repair by the nucleotide excision repair pathway(1) and for checkpoint-induced cell cycle arrest in promoting cell survival(2). Here we examine the response of yeast cells to CLUV and identify a key role for the RAD6-RAD18-RAD5 error- free postreplication repair (RAD6 error-free PRR) pathway(3,4) in promoting cell growth and survival. We show that loss of the RAD6 error- free PRR pathway results in DNA-damage-checkpoint- induced G2 arrest in CLUV-exposed cells, whereas wild-type and nucleotide-excision-repair-deficient cells are largely unaffected. Cell cycle arrest in the absence of the RAD6 error- free PRR pathway was not caused by a repair defect or by the accumulation of ultraviolet-induced photoproducts. Notably, we observed increased replication protein A (RPA) and Rad52 - yellow fluorescent protein foci(5) in the CLUV- exposed rad18 Delta cells and demonstrated that Rad52- mediated homologous recombination is required for the viability of the rad18 Delta cells after release from CLUV- induced G2 arrest. These and other data presented suggest that, in response to environmental levels of ultraviolet exposure, the RAD6 error- free PRR pathway promotes replication of damaged templates without the generation of extensive single- stranded DNA regions. Thus, the error- free PRR pathway is specifically important during chronic low- dose ultraviolet exposure to prevent counter- productive DNA checkpoint activation and allow cells to proliferate normally.","[Hishida, Takashi; Kubota, Yoshino] Osaka Univ, Res Inst Microbial Dis, Suita, Osaka 5650871, Japan; [Carr, Antony M.] Univ Sussex, MRC Genome Damage & Stabil Ctr, Brighton BN1 9RQ, E Sussex, England; [Iwasaki, Hiroshi] Yokohama City Univ, Int Grad Sch Arts & Sci, Kanagawa 2300045, Japan","Hishida, T (reprint author), Osaka Univ, Res Inst Microbial Dis, 3-1 Yamadaoka, Suita, Osaka 5650871, Japan.",hishida@biken.osaka-u.ac.jp,,"Carr, Antony Michael/0000-0002-2028-2389","Sumitomo foundation; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research from the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology of Japan; MRC (UK) [G0600233]","We thank R.

Trends in the phase and the amplitude of the annual cycle have been observed, but the causes and significance of these changes remain poorly understood - in part because we lack an understanding of the natural variability. Here we show that the phase of the annual cycle of surface temperature over extratropical land shifted towards earlier seasons by 1.7 days between 1954 and 2007; this change is highly anomalous with respect to earlier variations, which we interpret as being indicative of the natural range. Significant changes in the amplitude of the annual cycle are also observed between 1954 and 2007. These shifts in the annual cycles appear to be related, in part, to changes in the northern annular mode of climate variability, although the land phase shift is significantly larger than that predicted by trends in the northern annular mode alone.

Here we report the direct observation of the intersubunit coordination and step size of such a ring ATPase, the double- stranded- DNA packaging motor in the bacteriophage phi 29. Using high- resolution optical tweezers, we find that packaging occurs in increments of 10 base pairs ( bp). Statistical analysis of the preceding dwell times reveals that multiple ATPs bind during each dwell, and application of high force reveals that these 10- bp increments are composed of four 2.5- bp steps. These results indicate that the hydrolysis cycles of the individual subunits are highly coordinated by means of a mechanism novel for ring ATPases. Furthermore, a step size that is a non- integer number of base pairs demands new models for motor - DNA interactions.","[Moffitt, Jeffrey R.; Chemla, Yann R.; Bustamante, Carlos] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Phys, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Moffitt, Jeffrey R.; Chemla, Yann R.; Bustamante, Carlos] Univ Calif Berkeley, Jason L Choy Lab Single Mol Biophys, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Aathavan, K.; Bustamante, Carlos] Univ Calif Berkeley, Biophys Grad Grp, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Grimes, Shelley; Jardine, Paul J.; Anderson, Dwight L.] Univ Minnesota, Dept Diagnost & Biol Sci, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA; [Anderson, Dwight L.] Univ Minnesota, Dept Microbiol, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA; [Bustamante, Carlos] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mol & Cell Biol, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Bustamante, Carlos] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Chem, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Bustamante, Carlos] Univ Calif Berkeley, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA","Bustamante, C (reprint author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Phys, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",carlos@alice.berkeley.edu,,"Jardine, Paul/0000-0002-1090-0550; Bustamante, Carlos/0000-0002-2970-0073; Chemla, Yann/0000-0001-9167-0234","National Science Foundation's Graduate Research Fellowship; Burroughs Welcome Fund's Career Awards at the Scientific Interface; NIH [GM-071552, DE-003606, GM-059604]","We thank C.

Although this is commonly attributed to violent mergers, the properties of many of these galaxies are incompatible with such events, showing gas- rich, clumpy, extended rotating disks not dominated by spheroids(1-5). Cosmological simulations(6) and clustering theory(6,7) are used to explore how these galaxies acquired their gas. Here we report that they are 'stream- fed galaxies', formed from steady, narrow, cold gas streams that penetrate the shock- heated media of massive dark matter haloes(8,9). A comparison with the observed abundance of star- forming galaxies implies that most of the input gas must rapidly convert to stars. One- third of the stream mass is in gas clumps leading to mergers of mass ratio greater than 1: 10, and the rest is in smoother flows. With a merger duty cycle of 0.1, three- quarters of the galaxies forming stars at a given rate are fed by smooth streams. The rarer, submillimetre galaxies that form stars even more intensely(2,12,13) are largely merger- induced starbursts. Unlike destructive mergers, the streams are likely to keep the rotating disk configuration intact, although turbulent and broken into giant star- forming clumps that merge into a central spheroid(4,10,11). This stream- driven scenario for the formation of discs and spheroids is an alternative to the merger picture.","[Dekel, A.; Birnboim, Y.; Engel, G.; Freundlich, J.; Goerdt, T.; Mumcuoglu, M.; Neistein, E.; Zinger, E.] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Racah Inst Phys, IL-91904 Jerusalem, Israel; [Birnboim, Y.] Harvard Smithsonian Ctr Astrophys, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Freundlich, J.] Ecole Normale Super, Dept Phys, F-75231 Paris, France; [Neistein, E.] Max Planck Inst Astrophys, D-85741 Garching, Germany; [Pichon, C.] Inst Astrophys, F-75014 Paris, France; [Pichon, C.] UPMC, F-75014 Paris, France; [Teyssier, R.] CEA Saclay, DSM IRFU, UMR AIM, F-91191 Gif Sur Yvette, France; [Teyssier, R.] Univ Zurich, Inst Theoret Phys, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland","Dekel, A (reprint author), Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Racah Inst Phys, IL-91904 Jerusalem, Israel.",dekel@phys.huji.ac.il,,"Birnboim, Yuval/0000-0002-6547-8545; Teyssier, Romain/0000-0001-7689-0933",France-Israel Teamwork in Sciences; German-Israel Science Foundation; Israel Science Foundation; NASA Theory Program at UCSC; Minerva fellowship,"We acknowledge discussions with N.Bouche, S.

Owing to their highly localized electromagnetic fields, they may be used for the transport and manipulation of photons on subwavelength scales(2-9). In particular, plasmonic resonant cavities represent an application that could exploit this field compression to create ultra-smal-lmode- volume devices. Akey figure of merit in this regard is the ratio of cavity quality factor, Q ( related to the dissipation rate of photons confined to the cavity), to cavity mode volume, V ( refs 10, 11). However, plasmonic cavity Q factors have so far been limited to values less than 100 both for visible and near- infrared wave-lengths(12) (-16). Significantly, such values are far below the theoretically achievable Q factors for plasmonic resonant structures. Here we demonstrate a high- Q SPP whispering- gallery microcavity that is made by coating the surface of a high- Q silica microresonator with a thin layer of a noble metal. Using this structure, Q factors of 1,376+/-65 can be achieved in the near infrared for surface- plasmonic whispering- gallery modes at room temperature. This nearly ideal value, which is close to the theoretical metal- loss- limited Q factor, is attributed to the suppression and minimization of radiation and scattering losses that are made possible by the geometrical structure and the fabrication method. The SPP eigenmodes, as well as the dielectric eigenmodes, are confined within the whispering- gallery microcavity and accessed evanescently using a single strand of low-loss, tapered optical waveguide(17,18). This coupling scheme provides a convenient way of selectively exciting and probing confined SPP eigenmodes. Up to 49.7 per cent of input power is coupled by phase- matching control between the microcavity SPP and the tapered fibre eigenmodes.","[Min, Bumki; Sorger, Volker; Ulin-Avila, Erick; Zhang, Xiang] Univ Calif Berkeley, Nanoscale Sci & Engn Ctr, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Min, Bumki; Ostby, Eric; Yang, Lan; Vahala, Kerry] CALTECH, Thomas J Watson Lab Appl Phys, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA; [Zhang, Xiang] Univ Calif Berkeley, Lawrence Berkeley Lab, Div Mat Sci, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA","Zhang, X (reprint author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Nanoscale Sci & Engn Ctr, 5130 Etcheverry Hall, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",xiang@berkeley.edu; vahala@caltech.edu,"Min, Bumki/A-1294-2007; ulin-avila, erick/M-3278-2014",,US Air Force Office of Scientific Research MURI [FA9550-04-1-0434]; NSF Nanoscale Science and Engineering Center [DMI-0327077],We thank R.

This pattern of temperature change has been attributed to the increased strength of the circumpolar westerlies, largely in response to changes in stratospheric ozone(2). This picture, however, is substantially incomplete owing to the sparseness and short duration of the observations. Here we show that significant warming extends well beyond the Antarctic Peninsula to cover most of West Antarctica, an area of warming much larger than previously reported. West Antarctic warming exceeds 0.1 degrees C per decade over the past 50 years, and is strongest in winter and spring. Although this is partly offset by autumn cooling in East Antarctica, the continent- wide average near- surface temperature trend is positive. Simulations using a general circulation model reproduce the essential features of the spatial pattern and the long- term trend, and we suggest that neither can be attributed directly to increases in the strength of the westerlies. Instead, regional changes in atmospheric circulation and associated changes in sea surface temperature and sea ice are required to explain the enhanced warming in West Antarctica.","[Steig, Eric J.] Univ Washington, Dept Earth & Space Sci, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Steig, Eric J.] Univ Washington, Quaternary Res Ctr, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Schneider, David P.] Natl Ctr Atmospher Res, Boulder, CO 80307 USA; [Rutherford, Scott D.] Roger Williams Univ, Dept Environm Sci, Bristol, RI 02809 USA; [Mann, Michael E.] Penn State Univ, Dept Meteorol, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Mann, Michael E.] Penn State Univ, Earth & Environm Syst Inst, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Comiso, Josefino C.] NASA, Goddard Space Flight Ctr, NASA Lab Hydrospher & Biospher Sci, Greenbelt, MD 20771 USA; [Shindell, Drew T.] NASA, Goddard Inst Space Studies, New York, NY 10025 USA; [Shindell, Drew T.] Columbia Univ, Ctr Climate Syst Res, New York, NY 10025 USA","Steig, EJ (reprint author), Univ Washington, Dept Earth & Space Sci, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.",steig@ess.washington.edu,"Schneider, David/E-2726-2010; Shindell, Drew/D-4636-2012; Steig, Eric/G-9088-2015; Mann, Michael/B-8472-2017","Schneider, David/0000-0001-5308-1834; Steig, Eric/0000-0002-8191-5549; Mann, Michael/0000-0003-3067-296X","US National Science Foundation [OPP-0440414, OPP-0126161, OPP-0125670]; US ITASE","E.J.S. and D.P.S. were supported by the US National Science Foundation, grant numbers OPP-0440414 and OPP-0126161, as part of the US ITASE programme.

Recently, more detailed models have incorporated higher levels of constraint in order to reproduce the actual links observed in real food webs(5,6). Here, building on previous stochastic models of consumer - resource interactions between species(1-3), we propose a highly parsimonious model that can reproduce the overall bipartite structure of cooperative partner - partner interactions, as exemplified by plant - animal mutualistic networks(7). Our stochastic model of bipartite cooperation uses simple specialization and interaction rules, and only requires three empirical input parameters. We test the bipartite cooperation model on ten large pollination data sets that have been compiled in the literature, and find that it successfully replicates the degree distribution, nestedness and modularity of the empirical networks. These properties are regarded as key to understanding cooperation in mutualistic networks(8-10). We also apply our model to an extensive data set of two classes of company engaged in joint production in the garment industry. Using the same metrics, we find that the network of manufacturer - contractor interactions exhibits similar structural patterns to plant - animal pollination networks. This surprising correspondence between ecological and organizational networks suggests that the simple rules of cooperation that generate bipartite networks may be generic, and could prove relevant in many different domains, ranging from biological systems to human society(11-14).","[Saavedra, Serguei; Reed-Tsochas, Felix] Univ Oxford, CABDyN Complex Ctr, Oxford OX1 1HP, England; [Saavedra, Serguei] Univ Oxford, Corp Reputat Ctr, Oxford OX1 1HP, England; [Reed-Tsochas, Felix] Univ Oxford, James Martin Inst, Said Business Sch, Oxford OX1 1HP, England; [Saavedra, Serguei] Univ Oxford, Dept Engn Sci, Oxford OX1 3PJ, England; [Uzzi, Brian] Northwestern Univ, JL Kellogg Grad Sch Management, Evanston, IL 60208 USA; [Uzzi, Brian] Northwestern Univ, NW Inst Complex Syst, Evanston, IL 60208 USA; [Uzzi, Brian] Univ Calif Berkeley, Haas Sch Business, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA","Reed-Tsochas, F (reprint author), Univ Oxford, CABDyN Complex Ctr, Oxford OX1 1HP, England.",felix.reed-tsochas@sbs.ox.ac.uk,,,European Commission; MMCOMNET; CONACYT; Oxford University Corporate Reputation Centre; CABDyN Complexity Centre,"We thank J.

Regions with chronically low iron concentrations are sporadically pulsed with new iron inputs by way of dust(3) or lateral advection from continental margins(4). Addition of iron to surface waters in these areas induces massive phytoplankton blooms dominated primarily by pennate diatoms(5,6). Here we provide evidence that the bloom- forming pennate diatoms Pseudo- nitzschia and Fragilariopsis use the iron- concentrating protein, ferritin, to safely store iron. Ferritin has not been reported previously in any member of the Stramenopiles, a diverse eukaryotic lineage that includes unicellular algae, macroalgae and plant parasites. Phylogenetic analyses suggest that ferritin may have arisen in this small subset of diatoms through a lateral gene transfer. The crystal structure and functional assays of recombinant ferritin derived from Pseudo- nitzschia multiseries reveal a maxi- ferritin that exhibits ferroxidase activity and binds iron. The protein is predicted to be targeted to the chloroplast to control the distribution and storage of iron for proper functioning of the photosynthetic machinery. Abundance of Pseudo- nitzschia ferritin transcripts is regulated by iron nutritional status, and is closely tied to the loss and recovery of photosynthetic competence. Enhanced iron storage with ferritin allows the oceanic diatom Pseudo- nitzschia granii to undergo several more cell divisions in the absence of iron than the comparably sized, oceanic centric diatom Thalassiosira oceanica. Ferritin in pennate diatoms probably contributes to their success in chronically low- iron regions that receive intermittent iron inputs, and provides an explanation for the importance of these organisms in regulating oceanic CO2 over geological timescales(7,8).","[Marchetti, Adrian; Parker, Micaela S.; Lin, Ellen O.; Ribalet, Francois; Armbrust, E.

It is also an opportunistic human pathogen in immunocompromised individuals, causing potentially lethal invasive infections(2,3), and is associated with severe asthma and sinusitis(4). The species is only known to reproduce by asexual means(5), but there has been accumulating evidence for recombination and gene flow from population genetic studies(5-8), genome analysis(9,10), the presence of mating- type genes(8,10) and expression of sex- related genes(8) in the fungus. Here we show that A. fumigatus possesses a fully functional sexual reproductive cycle that leads to the production of cleistothecia and ascospores, and the teleomorph Neosartorya fumigata is described. The species has a heterothallic breeding system; isolates of complementary mating types are required for sex to occur. We demonstrate increased genotypic variation resulting from recombination between mating type and DNA fingerprint markers in ascospore progeny from an Irish environmental subpopulation. The ability of A. fumigatus to engage in sexual reproduction is highly significant in understanding the biology and evolution of the species. The presence of a sexual cycle provides an invaluable tool for classical genetic analyses and will facilitate research into the genetic basis of pathogenicity and fungicide resistance in A. fumigatus, with the aim of improving methods for the control of aspergillosis. These results also yield insights into the potential for sexual reproduction in other supposedly 'asexual' fungi.","[O'Gorman, Celine M.; Fuller, Hubert T.] Univ Coll Dublin, Sch Biol & Environm Sci, Dublin 4, Ireland; [O'Gorman, Celine M.; Dyer, Paul S.] Univ Nottingham, Sch Biol, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England","O'Gorman, CM (reprint author), Univ Coll Dublin, Sch Biol & Environm Sci, Dublin 4, Ireland.",celine.ogorman@ucd.ie; paul.dyer@nottingham.ac.uk,"O'Gorman, Celine/E-7732-2010","O'Gorman, Celine/0000-0001-9618-8981",IRCSET Postgraduate Research Scholarship; EC Marie Curie Training Fellowship; British Mycological Society,"We thank S.

Using a dual-wavelength optical imaging technique(9) that independently measures cerebral blood volume and oxygenation, continuously, in alert behaving monkeys, we find two distinct components to the haemodynamic signal in the alert animals' primary visual cortex (V1). One component is reliably predictable from neuronal responses generated by visual input. The other component - of almost comparable strength - is a hither to unknown signal that entrains to task structure independently of visual input or of standard neural predictors of haemodynamics. This latter component shows predictive timing, with increases of cerebral blood volume in anticipation of trial onsets even in darkness. This trial- locked haemodynamic signal could be due to an accompanying V1 arterial pumping mechanism, closely matched in time, with peaks of arterial dilation entrained to predicted trial onsets. These findings ( tested in two animals) challenge the current understanding of the link between brain haemodynamics and local neuronal activity. They also suggest the existence of a novel preparatory mechanism in the brain that brings additional arterial blood to cortex in anticipation of expected tasks.","[Sirotin, Yevgeniy B.; Das, Aniruddha] Columbia Univ, Dept Neurosci, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Das, Aniruddha] Columbia Univ, Dept Psychiat, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Das, Aniruddha] Columbia Univ, WM Keck Ctr Brain Plastic & Cognit, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Das, Aniruddha] Columbia Univ, Mahoney Ctr Brain & Behav, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Das, Aniruddha] Columbia Univ, Dept Biomed Engn, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Das, Aniruddha] New York State Psychiat Inst & Hosp, Unit 87, New York, NY 10032 USA","Das, A (reprint author), Columbia Univ, Dept Neurosci, New York, NY 10027 USA.",ad2069@columbia.edu,,,Keck foundation; National Institutes of Health; Klingenstein Foundation; Gatsby Initiative in Brain Circuitry; Dana Foundation; National Research Service Award,"We thank: K.

Studies of a few unrelated, healthy adults have revealed substantial diversity in their gut communities, as measured by sequencing 16S rRNA genes(6-8), yet how this diversity relates to function and to the rest of the genes in the collective genomes of the microbiota ( the gut microbiome) remains obscure. Studies of lean and obese mice suggest that the gut microbiota affects energy balance by influencing the efficiency of calorie harvest from the diet, and how this harvested energy is used and stored(3-5). Here we characterize the faecal microbial communities of adult female monozygotic and dizygotic twin pairs concordant for leanness or obesity, and their mothers, to address how host genotype, environmental exposure and host adiposity influence the gut microbiome. Analysis of 154 individuals yielded 9,920 near full- length and 1,937,461 partial bacterial 16S rRNA sequences, plus 2.14 gigabases from their microbiomes. The results reveal that the human gut microbiome is shared among family members, but that each person's gut microbial community varies in the specific bacterial lineages present, with a comparable degree of co- variation between adult monozygotic and dizygotic twin pairs. However, there was a wide array of shared microbial genes among sampled individuals, comprising an extensive, identifiable 'core microbiome' at the gene, rather than at the organismal lineage, level. Obesity is associated with phylum- level changes in the microbiota, reduced bacterial diversity and altered representation of bacterial genes and metabolic pathways. These results demonstrate that a diversity of organismal assemblages can nonetheless yield a core microbiome at a functional level, and that deviations from his core are associated with different physiological states (obese compared with lean).","[Turnbaugh, Peter J.; Yatsunenko, Tanya; Ley, Ruth E.; Gordon, Jeffrey I.] Washington Univ, Sch Med, Ctr Genome Sci, St Louis, MO 63108 USA; [Duncan, Alexis; Heath, Andrew C.] Washington Univ, Sch Med, Dept Psychiat, St Louis, MO 63108 USA; [Hamady, Micah] Univ Colorado, Dept Comp Sci, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Knight, Rob] Univ Colorado, Dept Chem & Biochem, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Cantarel, Brandi L.; Henrissat, Bernard] CNRS, UMR6098, Marseille, France; [Sogin, Mitchell L.] Marine Biol Lab, Josephine Bay Paul Ctr, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA; [Jones, William J.] Univ S Carolina, Environm Genome Core Facil, Columbia, SC 29208 USA; [Roe, Bruce A.] Univ Oklahoma, Dept Chem & Biochem, Norman, OK 73019 USA; [Roe, Bruce A.] Univ Oklahoma, Adv Ctr Genome Technol, Norman, OK 73019 USA; [Affourtit, Jason P.; Egholm, Michael] 454 Life Sci, Branford, CT 06405 USA","Gordon, JI (reprint author), Washington Univ, Sch Med, Ctr Genome Sci, St Louis, MO 63108 USA.",jgordon@wustl.edu,"Henrissat, Bernard/J-2475-2012; Ley, Ruth/M-8542-2014; Knight, Rob/D-1299-2010","Ley, Ruth/0000-0002-9087-1672; Turnbaugh, Peter/0000-0002-0888-2875; Knight, Rob/0000-0002-0975-9019","National Institutes of Health [DK78669, ES012742, AA09022, HD049024]; National Science Foundation [OCE0430724]; W.M.

Many pathogens exploit the challenge of self discrimination by employing mimicry to subvert key cellular processes including the cell cycle, apoptosis and cytoskeletal dynamics(1-5). Other mimics interfere with immunity(6,7). Poxviruses encode K3L, a mimic of eIF2 alpha, which is the substrate of protein kinase R ( PKR), an important component of innate immunity in vertebrates(8,9). The PKR - K3L interaction exemplifies the conundrum imposed by viral mimicry. To be effective, PKR must recognize a conserved substrate (eIF2 alpha) while avoiding rapidly evolving substrate mimics such as K3L. Using the PKR - K3L system and a combination of phylogenetic and functional analyses, we uncover evolutionary strategies by which host proteins can overcome mimicry. We find that PKR has evolved under intense episodes of positive selection in primates. The ability of PKR to evade viral mimics is partly due to positive selection at sites most intimately involved in eIF2 alpha recognition. We also find that adaptive changes on multiple surfaces of PKR produce combinations of substitutions that increase the odds of defeating mimicry. Thus, although it can seem that pathogens gain insurmountable advantages by mimicking cellular components, host factors such as PKR can compete in molecular 'arms races' with mimics because of evolutionary flexibility at protein interaction interfaces challenged by mimicry.","[Elde, Nels C.; Malik, Harmit S.] Fred Hutchinson Canc Res Ctr, Div Basic Sci, Seattle, WA 98109 USA; [Child, Stephanie J.; Geballe, Adam P.] Fred Hutchinson Canc Res Ctr, Div Human Biol, Seattle, WA 98109 USA; [Geballe, Adam P.] Fred Hutchinson Canc Res Ctr, Div Clin Res, Seattle, WA 98109 USA; [Geballe, Adam P.] Univ Washington, Dept Med, Seattle, WA 98115 USA; [Geballe, Adam P.] Univ Washington, Dept Microbiol, Seattle, WA 98115 USA","Malik, HS (reprint author), Fred Hutchinson Canc Res Ctr, Div Basic Sci, Seattle, WA 98109 USA.",hsmalik@fhcrc.org,"Malik, Harmit/E-8519-2012","Malik, Harmit/0000-0001-6005-0016",NIH [AI026672]; Searle Scholar; Burroughs Wellcome Investigator Award; Ellison Medical Foundation Fellow of the Life Sciences Research Foundation,"We thank T.

Here we develop an in vivo assay for adult haematopoietic stem- cell ( HSC) niche formation(1,2). With this assay, we identified a population of progenitor cells with surface markers CD45(-)Tie2(-)alpha(+)(V)CD105(+)Thy1.1(-) (CD105(+)Thy1(-)) that, when sorted from 15.5 days post- coitum fetal bones and transplanted under the adult mouse kidney capsule, could recruit host- derived blood vessels, produce donor- derived ectopic bones through a cartilage intermediate and generate a marrow cavity populated by host- derived long- term reconstituting HSC (LT-HSC). In contrast, CD45(-)Tie2(-)alpha(+)(V)CD105(+)Thy1(+) (CD105(+)Thy1(+)) fetal bone progenitors form bone that does not contain a marrow cavity. Suppressing expression of factors involved in endochondral ossification, such as osterix and vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF), inhibited niche generation. CD105(+)Thy1(-) progenitor populations derived from regions of the fetal mandible or calvaria that do not undergo endochondral ossification formed only bone without marrow in our assay. Collectively, our data implicate endochondral ossification, bone formation that proceeds through a cartilage intermediate, as a requirement for adult HSC niche formation.","[Chan, Charles K.

Apical constriction is conventionally thought to be driven by the continuous purse- string- like contraction of a circumferential actin and non- muscle myosin- II ( myosin) belt underlying adherens junctions(3-7). However, it is unclear whether other force- generating mechanisms can drive this process. Here we show, with the use of real- time imaging and quantitative image analysis of Drosophila gastrulation, that the apical constriction of ventral furrow cells is pulsed. Repeated constrictions, which are asynchronous between neighbouring cells, are interrupted by pauses in which the constricted state of the cell apex is maintained. In contrast to the purse- string model, constriction pulses are powered by actin - myosin network contractions that occur at the medial apical cortex and pull discrete adherens junction sites inwards. The transcription factors Twist and Snail differentially regulate pulsed constriction. Expression of snail initiates actin - myosin network contractions, whereas expression of twist stabilizes the constricted state of the cell apex. Our results suggest a new model for apical constriction in which a cortical actin - myosin cytoskeleton functions as a developmentally controlled subcellular ratchet to reduce apical area incrementally.","[Martin, Adam C.; Wieschaus, Eric F.] Princeton Univ, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Martin, Adam C.; Wieschaus, Eric F.] Princeton Univ, Dept Mol Biol, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Kaschube, Matthias] Princeton Univ, Lewis Sigler Inst Integrat Genom, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Kaschube, Matthias] Princeton Univ, Joseph Henry Labs Phys, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA","Wieschaus, EF (reprint author), Princeton Univ, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA.",efw@princeton.edu,,,American Cancer Society [PF-06-143-01-DDC]; National Institutes of Health/National Institute of General Medical Sciences [P50 GM071508]; National Institute of Child Health and Human Development [5R37HD15587],"We thank D.

These cells project primarily to brain centres for non- image- forming visual functions such as the pupillary light reflex and circadian photoentrainment. How well they signal intrinsic light absorption to drive behaviour remains unclear. Here we report fundamental parameters governing their intrinsic light responses and associated spike generation. The membrane density of melanopsin is 10(4)-fold lower than that of rod and cone pigments, resulting in a very low photon catch and a phototransducing role only in relatively bright light. Nonetheless, each captured photon elicits a large and extraordinarily prolonged response, with a unique shape among known photoreceptors. Notably, like rods, these cells are capable of signalling single- photon absorption. A flash causing a few hundred isomerized melanopsin molecules in a retina is sufficient for reaching threshold for the pupillary light reflex.","[Do, Michael Tri H.; Kang, Shin H.; Xue, Tian; Zhong, Haining; Liao, Hsi-Wen; Bergles, Dwight E.; Yau, King-Wai] Johns Hopkins Univ, Sch Med, Solomon H Snyder Dept Neurosci, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA; [Yau, King-Wai] Johns Hopkins Univ, Sch Med, Dept Ophthalmol, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA; [Do, Michael Tri H.; Xue, Tian; Yau, King-Wai] Johns Hopkins Univ, Sch Med, Ctr Sensory Biol, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA","Do, MTH (reprint author), Johns Hopkins Univ, Sch Med, Solomon H Snyder Dept Neurosci, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA.",mdo@jhmi.edu; kwyau@mail.jhmi.edu,"Do, Michael Tri/A-5917-2009","Do, Michael Tri/0000-0001-6418-0977; Zhong, Haining/0000-0002-7109-4724",NRSA; VNTP Training Grant; NIH,"Supported by an NRSA fellowship and a VNTP Training Grant to M.

Yet the radial distributions of blue stragglers in many clusters are bimodal, with a dominant central peak(5-7): this has been interpreted as an indication that collisions do dominate blue straggler production, at least in the high- density cluster cores(7,8). Here we report that there is a clear, but sublinear, correlation between the number of blue stragglers found in a cluster core and the total stellar mass contained within it. From this we conclude that most blue stragglers, even those found in cluster cores, come from binary systems. The parent binaries, however, may themselves have been affected by dynamical encounters. This may be the key to reconciling all of the seemingly conflicting results found to date.","[Knigge, Christian] Univ Southampton, Sch Phys & Astron, Southampton SO17 1BJ, Hants, England; [Leigh, Nathan; Sills, Alison] McMaster Univ, Dept Phys & Astron, Hamilton, ON L8S 4M1, Canada","Knigge, C (reprint author), Univ Southampton, Sch Phys & Astron, Southampton SO17 1BJ, Hants, England.",christian@astro.soton.ac.uk,,,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada,Research support for C.K. was provided by the UK Science and Technology Facilities Council.

Their elementary excitations, polaritons - mixtures of excitons and photons - can accumulate in macroscopically degenerate states to form various types of condensate in a wide range of experimental configurations, under either incoherent(1,2) or coherent(3,4) excitation. Condensates of polaritons have been put forward as candidates for superfluidity(5,6), and the formation of vortices(7) as well as elementary excitations with linear dispersion(8) are actively sought as evidence to support this. Here, using a coherent excitation triggered by a short optical pulse, we have created and set in motion a macroscopically degenerate state of polaritons that can be made to collide with a variety of defects present in the microcavity. Our experiments show striking manifestations of a coherent light - matter packet, travelling at high speed ( of the order of one per cent of the speed of light) and displaying collective dynamics consistent with superfluidity, although one of a highly unusual character as it involves an out- of- equilibrium dissipative system. Our main results are the observation of a linear polariton dispersion accompanied by diffusionless motion; flow without resistance when crossing an obstacle; suppression of Rayleigh scattering; and splitting into two fluids when the size of the obstacle is comparable to the size of the wave packet. This work opens the way to the investigation of new phenomenology of out- of- equilibrium condensates.","[Amo, A.; Sanvitto, D.; Ballarini, D.; Martin, M.

In the high- T-c copper oxide superconductors, however, a pseudogap(1-8) extends above T-c. The relationship between the pseudogap and superconductivity is one of the central issues in this field(9-17). Spectral gaps arising from pairing precursors are qualitatively similar to those caused by competing electronic states, rendering a standard approach to their analysis inconclusive(10-16). The issue can be settled, however, by studying the correlation between the weights associated with the pseudogap and superconductivity spectral features. Here we report a study of two spectral weights using angle- resolved photo-emission spectroscopy. The weight of the superconducting coherent peak increases away from the node following the trend of the superconducting gap, but starts to decrease in the antinodal region. This striking non- monotonicity reveals the presence of a competing state. We emonstrate a direct correlation, for different values of momenta and doping, between the loss in the low- energy spectral weight arising from the opening of the pseudogap and a decrease in the spectral weight associated with superconductivity. We therefore conclude that the pseudogap competes with the superconductivity by depleting the spectral weight available for pairing.","[Kondo, Takeshi; Schmalian, Joerg; Kaminski, Adam] Iowa State Univ, Ames Lab, Ames, IA 50011 USA; [Kondo, Takeshi; Schmalian, Joerg; Kaminski, Adam] Iowa State Univ, Dept Phys & Astron, Ames, IA 50011 USA; [Khasanov, Rustem] Paul Scherrer Inst, Lab Muon Spin Spect, CH-5232 Villigen, Switzerland; [Takeuchi, Tsunehiro] Nagoya Univ, Dept Crystalline Mat Sci, Nagoya, Aichi 4648603, Japan; [Takeuchi, Tsunehiro] Nagoya Univ, EcoTopia Sci Inst, Nagoya, Aichi 4648603, Japan","Kaminski, A (reprint author), Iowa State Univ, Ames Lab, Ames, IA 50011 USA.",kondo@ameslab.gov; kaminski@ameslab.gov,"Schmalian, Joerg/H-2313-2011; Kondo, Takeshi/H-2680-2016","Schmalian, Joerg/0000-0003-4142-2448; ",Basic Energy Sciences; US Department of Energy,"We thank A.J.

It has long been argued that the influence of rotation on turbulent convection dynamics is governed by the ratio of the relevant global- scale forces: the Coriolis force and the buoyancy force(7-12). Here, however, we present results from laboratory and numerical experiments which exhibit transitions between rotationally dominated and non- rotating behaviour that are not determined by this global force balance. Instead, the transition is controlled by the relative thicknesses of the thermal ( nonrotating) and Ekman ( rotating) boundary layers. We formulate a predictive description of the transition between the two regimes on the basis of the competition between these two boundary layers. This transition scaling theory unifies the disparate results of an extensive array of previous experiments(8-15), and is broadly applicable to natural convection systems.","[King, Eric M.; Noir, Jerome; Aurnou, Jonathan M.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Earth & Space Sci, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Stellmach, Stephan; Hansen, Ulrich] Univ Munster, Inst Geophys, D-48149 Munster, Germany","King, EM (reprint author), Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Earth & Space Sci, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.",eric.king@ucla.edu,"King, Eric/A-2274-2009",,US National Science Foundation Earth Sciences Division Geophysics Program; NASA Planetary Atmospheres Program; German Research Foundation; NASA Solar and Heliospheric Physics Program,"Salary support for E.M.K., J.N. and J.M.A. was provided by the US National Science Foundation Earth Sciences Division Geophysics Program and the NASA Planetary Atmospheres Program.

The exclusively Palaeozoic 'acanthodians' are possibly the earliest(2,3) gnathostome group and exhibit amosaic of shark- and bony fish- like characters that has long given them prominence in discussions of early gnathostome evolution(1). Their relationships with modern gnathostomes have remained mysterious, partly because their un- mineralized endoskeletons rarely fossilized. Here I present the first- known braincase of an Early Devonian (approximately 418-412 Myr BP) acanthodian, Ptomacanthus anglicus(4), and re- evaluate the interrelationships of basal gnathostomes. Acanthodian braincases have previously been represented by a single genus, Acanthodes(5), which occurs more than 100 million years later in the fossil record. The braincase of Ptomacanthus differs radically from the osteichthyan- like braincase of Acanthodes(5) in exhibiting several plesiomorphic features shared with placoderms(6,7) and some early chondrichthyans(8,9). Most striking is its extremely short sphenoid region and its jaw suspension, which displays features intermediate between some Palaeozoic chondrichthyans and osteichthyans. Phylogenetic analysis resolves Ptomacanthus as either the most basal chondrichthyan or as the sister group of all living gnathostomes. These new data alter earlier conceptions of basal gnathostome phylogeny and thus help to provide a more detailed picture of the acquisition of early gnathostome characters.","[Brazeau, Martin D.] Uppsala Univ, Evolut Biol Ctr, Dept Physiol & Dev Biol, Subdept Evolutionary Organismal Biol, SE-75236 Uppsala, Sweden","Brazeau, MD (reprint author), Uppsala Univ, Evolut Biol Ctr, Dept Physiol & Dev Biol, Subdept Evolutionary Organismal Biol, Norbyvagen 18A, SE-75236 Uppsala, Sweden.",martin.brazeau@gmail.com,"Brazeau, Martin/B-6971-2009","Brazeau, Martin/0000-0001-6566-2820; Brazeau, Martin/0000-0002-0650-1282",Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada Postgraduate Scholarship,"I thank M.

Restructuring of synaptic connections is believed to be one mechanism by which cortical circuits store information about the sensory world(4,5). Excitatory synaptic structures, such as dendritic spines, are dynamic entities(6-8) that remain sensitive to alteration of sensory input throughout life(6,9). It remains unclear, however, whether structural changes at the level of dendritic spines can outlast the original experience and thereby provide a morphological basis for long- term information storage. Here we follow spine dynamics on apical dendrites of pyramidal neurons in functionally defined regions of adult mouse visual cortex during plasticity of eye- specific responses induced by repeated closure of one eye ( monocular deprivation). The first monocular deprivation episode doubled the rate of spine formation, thereby increasing spine density. This effect was specific to layer-5 cells located in binocular cortex, where most neurons increase their responsiveness to the non-deprived eye(3,10). Restoring binocular vision returned spine dynamics to baseline levels, but absolute spine density remained elevated and many monocular deprivation-induced spines persisted during this period of functional recovery. However, spine addition did not increase again when the same eye was closed for a second time. This absence of structural plasticity stands out against the robust changes of eye- specific responses that occur even faster after repeated deprivation(3). Thus, spines added during the first monocular deprivation experience may provide a structural basis for subsequent functional shifts. These results provide a strong link between functional plasticity and specific synaptic rearrangements, revealing a mechanism of how prior experiences could be stored in cortical circuits.","[Hofer, Sonja B.; Mrsic-Flogel, Thomas D.; Bonhoeffer, Tobias; Huebener, Mark] Max Planck Inst Neurobiol, D-82152 Martinsried, Germany","Hubener, M (reprint author), Max Planck Inst Neurobiol, D-82152 Martinsried, Germany.",mark@neuro.mpg.de,"Bonhoeffer, Tobias/B-9481-2009","Bonhoeffer, Tobias/0000-0001-7897-6634",Max Planck Society; Wellcome Trust; Humboldt Foundation,"We thank T.

Red pulp macrophages are a distinct splenic subset involved in removing senescent red blood cells(2). Transcription factors such as PU.1 ( also known as Sfpi1) and C/EBPa (Cebpa) have general roles in myelomonocytic development(3,4), but the transcriptional basis for producing tissue macrophage subsets remains unknown. Here we show that Spi-C ( encoded by Spic), a PU.1- related transcription factor, selectively controls the development of red pulp macrophages. Spi-C is highly expressed in red pulp macrophages, but not monocytes, dendritic cells or other tissue macrophages. Spic(-/-) mice have a cell- autonomous defect in the development of red pulp macrophages that is corrected by retroviral Spi- C expression in bone marrow cells, but have normal monocyte and other macrophage subsets. Red pulp macrophages highly express genes involved in capturing circulating haemoglobin and in iron regulation. Spic(-/-) mice show ormal trapping of red blood cells in the spleen, but fail to phagocytose these red blood cells efficiently, and develop an iron overload localized selectively to splenic red pulp. Thus, Spi- C controls development of red pulp macrophages required for red blood cell recycling and iron homeostasis.","[Kohyama, Masako; Ise, Wataru; Edelson, Brian T.; Wilker, Peter R.; Hildner, Kai; Mejia, Carlo; Murphy, Theresa L.; Murphy, Kenneth M.] Washington Univ, Sch Med, Dept Pathol & Immunol, St Louis, MO 63110 USA; [Kohyama, Masako; Ise, Wataru; Hildner, Kai; Mejia, Carlo; Murphy, Kenneth M.] Washington Univ, Sch Med, Howard Hughes Med Inst, St Louis, MO 63110 USA; [Frazier, William A.] Washington Univ, Sch Med, Dept Biochem & Mol Biophys, St Louis, MO 63110 USA","Murphy, KM (reprint author), Washington Univ, Sch Med, Dept Pathol & Immunol, 660 S Euclid Ave, St Louis, MO 63110 USA.",murphy@wustl.edu,,,Howard Hughes Medical Institute; Burroughs Wellcome Fund Career Award for Medical Scientists,"This work was supported by the Howard Hughes Medical Institute (K.M.M.), and the Burroughs Wellcome Fund Career Award for Medical Scientists (B.T.E.).",,30,141,145,0,7,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,15-Jan,2009,457,7227,,,,,318,321,,10.1038/nature07472,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,394IR,WOS:000262440900040,19037245,No,,,11/20/17

It is composed of a glomerulus, the site of ultrafiltration, and a renal tubule, along which the filtrate is modified. Although widely regarded as a vertebrate adaptation(1), 'nephronlike' features can be found in the excretory systems of many invertebrates, raising the possibility that components of the vertebrate excretory system were inherited from their invertebrate ancestors(2). Here we show that the insect nephrocyte has remarkable anatomical, molecular and functional similarity to the glomerular podocyte, a cell in the vertebrate kidney that forms the main size-selective barrier as blood is ultrafiltered to make urine. In particular, both cell types possess a specialized filtration diaphragm, known as the slit diaphragm in podocytes or the nephrocyte diaphragm in nephrocytes. We find that fly ( Drosophila melanogaster) orthologues of the major constituents of the slit diaphragm, including nephrin, NEPH1 ( also known as KIRREL), CD2AP, ZO-1 (TJP1) and podocin, are expressed in the nephrocyte and form a complex of interacting proteins that closely mirrors the vertebrate slit diaphragm complex. Furthermore, we find that the nephrocyte diaphragm is completely lost in flies lacking the orthologues of nephrin or NEPH1 - a phenotype resembling loss of the slit diaphragm in the absence of either nephrin ( as in human congenital nephrotic syndrome of the Finnish type, NPHS1) or NEPH1. These changes markedly impair filtration function in the nephrocyte. The similarities we describe between invertebrate nephrocytes and vertebrate podocytes provide evidence suggesting that the two cell types are evolutionarily related, and establish the nephrocyte as a simple model in which to study podocyte biology and podocyte- associated diseases.","[Weavers, Helen; Skaer, Helen; Denholm, Barry] Univ Cambridge, Dept Zool, Cambridge CB2 3EJ, England; [Prieto-Sanchez, Silvia; Ruiz-Gomez, Mar] Univ Autonoma Madrid, CSIC, Ctr Biol Mol Severo Ochoa, E-28049 Madrid, Spain; [Grawe, Ferdinand] Univ Dusseldorf, Inst Genet, D-40225 Dusseldorf, Germany; [Garcia-Lopez, Amparo; Artero, Ruben] Univ Valencia, Dept Genet, E-46100 Valencia, Spain; [Wilsch-Braeuninger, Michaela] Max Planck Inst Mol Cell Biol & Genet, D-01307 Dresden, Germany","Skaer, H (reprint author), Univ Cambridge, Dept Zool, Downing St, Cambridge CB2 3EJ, England.",hs17@cam.ac.uk,"Artero, Ruben/K-6815-2014","Artero, Ruben/0000-0003-1596-047X; Weavers, Helen/0000-0002-5383-6085","Wellcome Trust [072441, 079221]; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft SFB 590 [SFB 590]; ARC [1242]; MEC [BFU2007-62201]; Fundacion Ramon Areces; CBMSO; EC [LSHG-CT-2004-511978]; FPU","We thank F.

Circadian clocks mediate metabolic pathways and increase fitness in animals and plants(5-8). Here we report that epigenetic modifications of the circadian clock genes CIRCADIAN CLOCK ASSOCIATED 1 (CCA1) and LATE ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL (LHY)(9-11) and their reciprocal regulators TIMING OF CAB EXPRESSION 1 ( TOC1) and GIGANTEA (GI)(10,12,13) mediate expression changes in downstream genes and pathways. During the day, epigenetic repression of CCA1 and LHY induced the expression of TOC1, GI and downstream genes containing evening elements(14) in chlorophyll and starch metabolic pathways in allotetraploids and F(1) hybrids, which produced more chlorophyll and starch than the parents in the same environment. Mutations in cca1 and cca1 lhy and the daily repression of cca1 by RNA interference (RNAi) in TOC1:: cca1(RNAi) transgenic plants increased the expression of downstream genes and increased chlorophyll and starch content, whereas constitutively expressing CCA1 or ectopically expressing TOC1:: CCA1 had the opposite effect. The causal effects of CCA1 on output traits suggest that hybrids and allopolyploids gain advantages from the control of circadian- mediated physiological and metabolic pathways, leading to growth vigour and increased biomass.","[Ni, Zhongfu; Kim, Eun-Deok; Ha, Misook; Lackey, Erika; Liu, Jianxin; Zhang, Yirong; Chen, Z.

Myxopyronin inhibits bacterial RNA polymerase ( RNAP) by an unknown mechanism(3). Here we report the structure of dMyx - a desmethyl derivative of myxopyronin B(4) - complexed with a Thermus thermophilus RNAP holoenzyme. The antibiotic binds to a pocket deep inside the RNAP clamp head domain, which interacts with the DNA template in the transcription bubble(5,6). Notably, binding of dMyx stabilizes refolding of the beta'-subunit switch- 2 segment, resulting in a configuration that might indirectly compromise binding to, or directly clash with, the melted template DNA strand. Consistently, footprinting data show that the antibiotic binding does not prevent nucleation of the promoter DNA melting but instead blocks its propagation towards the active site. Myxopyronins are thus, to our knowledge, a first structurally characterized class of antibiotics that target formation of the pre- catalytic transcription initiation complex the decisive step in gene expression control. Notably, mutations designed in switch- 2 mimic the dMyx effects on promoter complexes in the absence of antibiotic. Overall, our results indicate a plausible mechanism of the dMyx action and a stepwise pathway of open complex formation in which core enzyme mediates the final stage of DNA melting near the transcription start site, and that switch- 2 might act as a molecular checkpoint for DNA loading in response to regulatory signals or antibiotics. The universally conserved switch- 2 may have the same role in all multisubunit RNAPs.","[Belogurov, Georgiy A.; Sevostyanova, Anastasiya; Artsimovitch, Irina] Ohio State Univ, Dept Microbiol, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Vassylyeva, Marina N.; Klyuyev, Sergiy; Vassylyev, Dmitry G.] Univ Alabama, Sch Med, Dept Biochem & Mol Genet, Birmingham, AL 35294 USA; [Vassylyeva, Marina N.; Klyuyev, Sergiy; Vassylyev, Dmitry G.] Univ Alabama, Sch Dent, Dept Biochem & Mol Genet, Birmingham, AL 35294 USA; [Appleman, James R.; Xiang, Alan X.; Lira, Ricardo; Webber, Stephen E.] Anadys Pharmaceut Inc, San Diego, CA 92121 USA; [Nudler, Evgeny] NYU, Sch Med, Dept Biochem, New York, NY 10016 USA","Artsimovitch, I (reprint author), Ohio State Univ, Dept Microbiol, 484 W 12Th Ave, Columbus, OH 43210 USA.",artsimovitch.1@osu.edu; dmitry@uab.edu,"Vassylyev, Dmitry/A-9005-2008","Belogurov, Georgiy/0000-0002-3070-6843; Nudler, Evgeny/0000-0002-8811-3071","US Department of Energy, Office of Energy Research [W-31-109-Eng-38]; National Institutes of Health","T.

The antiparallel nature of duplex DNA permits the leading- strand polymerase to advance in a continuous fashion, but forces the lagging- strand polymerase to synthesize in the opposite direction. By extending RNA primers, the lagging- strand polymerase restarts at short intervals and produces Okazaki fragments(1,2).At least in prokaryotic systems, this directionality problem is solved by the formation of a loop in the lagging strand of the replication fork to reorient the lagging- strand DNA polymerase so that it advances in parallel with the leading- strand polymerase. The replication loop grows and shrinks during each cycle of Okazaki fragment synthesis(3). Here we use single- molecule techniques to visualize, in real time, the formation and release of replication loops by individual replisomes of bacteriophage T7 supporting coordinated DNA replication. Analysis of the distributions of loop sizes and lag times between loops reveals that initiation of primer synthesis and the completion of an Okazaki fragment each serve as a trigger for loop release. The presence of two triggers may represent a fail-safe mechanism ensuring the timely reset of the replisome after the synthesis of every Okazaki fragment.","[Hamdan, Samir M.; Loparo, Joseph J.; Takahashi, Masateru; Richardson, Charles C.; van Oijen, Antoine M.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Biol Chem & Mol Pharmacol, Boston, MA 02115 USA","van Oijen, AM (reprint author), Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Biol Chem & Mol Pharmacol, 240 Longwood Ave, Boston, MA 02115 USA.",antoine_van_oijen@hms.harvard.edu,,"van Oijen, Antoine/0000-0002-1794-5161; Hamdan, Samir/0000-0001-5192-1852","National Institutes of Health [GM-077248, GM-54397]; National Science Foundation [CAREER 0543784]; Jane Coffin Childs Memorial Fund",We thank J.-B.

These two processes, which together ensure the specific acceptance of a correctly charged cognate tRNA into the aminoacyl ( A) site, operate before peptide bond formation. Here we report the identification of an additional mechanism that contributes to high fidelity protein synthesis after peptidyl transfer, using a well- defined in vitro bacterial translation system. In this retrospective quality control step, the incorporation of an amino acid from a non- cognate tRNA into the growing polypeptide chain leads to a general loss of specificity in the A site of the ribosome, and thus to a propagation of errors that results in abortive termination of protein synthesis.","[Zaher, Hani S.; Green, Rachel] Johns Hopkins Univ, Sch Med, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Dept Mol Biol & Genet, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA","Green, R (reprint author), Johns Hopkins Univ, Sch Med, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Dept Mol Biol & Genet, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA.",ragreen@jhmi.edu,,,National Institutes of Health; Howard Hughes Medical Institute.,"We thank B.

The field strengths of planets and stars vary over three orders of magnitude, but the critical factor causing that variation has hitherto been unclear(5,6). Here we report an extension of a scaling law derived from geodynamo models(7) to rapidly rotating stars that have strong density stratification. The unifying principle in the scaling law is that the energy flux available for generating the magnetic field sets the field strength. Our scaling law fits the observed field strengths of Earth, Jupiter, young contracting stars and rapidly rotating low-mass stars, despite vast differences in the physical conditions of the objects. We predict that the field strengths of rapidly rotating brown dwarfs and massive extrasolar planets are high enough to make them observable.","[Christensen, Ulrich R.; Holzwarth, Volkmar] Max Planck Inst Sonnensyst Forsch, D-37191 Katlenburg Lindau, Germany; [Reiners, Ansgar] Univ Gottingen, Inst Astrophys, D-37077 Gottingen, Germany","Christensen, UR (reprint author), Max Planck Inst Sonnensyst Forsch, Max Planck Str 2, D-37191 Katlenburg Lindau, Germany.",christensen@mps.mpg.de,,,,,,30,140,140,0,14,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,8-Jan,2009,457,7226,,,,,167,169,,10.1038/nature07626,,3,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,393GS,WOS:000262360200026,19129842,No,,,11/20/17

At molecular separations of a few nanometres or less, these interactions are the familiar van der Waals forces(4). However, as recognized in the theories of Casimir, Polder and Lifshitz(5-7), at larger distances and between macroscopic condensed media they reveal retardation effects associated with the finite speed of light. Although these long- range forces exist within all matter, only attractive interactions have so far been measured between material bodies(8-11). Here we show experimentally that, in accord with theoretical prediction(12), the sign of the force can be changed from attractive to repulsive by suitable choice of interacting materials immersed in a fluid. The measured repulsive interaction is found to be weaker than the attractive. However, in both cases the magnitude of the force increases with decreasing surface separation. Repulsive Casimir - Lifshitz forces could allow quantum levitation of objects in a fluid and lead to a new class of switchable nanoscale devices with ultra-low static friction(13-15).","[Capasso, Federico] Harvard Univ, Sch Engn & Appl Sci, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Munday, J.

This ideal configuration is lost when photonic- crystal lasers are electrically pumped, which is practically more attractive as an external laser source is not required. In this case, in order to avoid lateral spreading of the electrical current, the device active area must be physically defined by appropriate semiconductor processing. This creates an abrupt change in the complex dielectric constant at the device boundaries, especially in the case of lasers operating in the far- infrared, where the large emission wavelengths impose device thicknesses of several micrometres. Here we show that such abrupt boundary conditions can dramatically influence the operation of electrically pumped photonic- crystal lasers. By demonstrating a general technique to implement reflecting or absorbing boundaries, we produce evidence that whispering- gallery- like modes or true photonic- crystal states can be alternatively excited. We illustrate the power of this technique by fabricating photonic- crystal terahertz ( THz) semiconductor lasers, where the photonic crystal is implemented via the sole patterning of the device top metallization. Single- mode laser action is obtained in the 2.55-2.88 THz range, and the emission far field exhibits a small angular divergence, thus providing a solution for the quasi- total lack of directionality typical of THz semiconductor lasers based on metal - metal waveguides(4).","[Chassagneux, Y.; Colombelli, R.] Univ Paris 11, Inst Elect Fondamentale, F-91405 Orsay, France; [Chassagneux, Y.; Colombelli, R.] CNRS, UMR 8622, F-91405 Orsay, France; [Maineult, W.; Barbieri, S.] Univ Paris 07, Lab MPQ, F-75013 Paris, France; [Maineult, W.; Barbieri, S.] CNRS, UMR 7162, F-75013 Paris, France; [Beere, H.

It is generally accepted that Earth's andesitic continental crust is the product of plate tectonics(1,2), whereas the Moon acquired its feldspar- rich crust by way of plagioclase flotation in a magma ocean(3,4). Basaltic meteorites provide evidence that, like the terrestrial planets, some asteroids generated crust and underwent large- scale differentiation processes(5). Until now, however, no evolved felsic asteroidal crust has been sampled or observed. Here we report age and compositional data for the newly discovered, paired and differentiated meteorites Graves Nunatak ( GRA) 06128 and GRA 06129. These meteorites are feldspar- rich, with andesite bulk compositions. Their age of 4.5+/-0.06 Gyr demonstrates formation early in Solar System history. The isotopic and elemental compositions, degree of metamorphic re-equilibration and sulphide- rich nature of the meteorites are most consistent with an origin as partial melts from a volatile- rich, oxidized asteroid. GRA 06128 and 06129 are the result of a newly recognized style of evolved crust formation, bearing witness to incomplete differentiation of their parent asteroid and to previously unrecognized diversity of early- formed materials in the Solar System.","[Day, James M.

They account for approximately 40% of oceanic primary productivity and over 50% of organic carbon burial in marine sediments(1). Owing to their role as a biological carbon pump(2) and effects on atmospheric CO(2) levels(3-5), there is great interest in elucidating factors that influenced the rapid rise in diatom diversity during the past 40 million years(6,7). Two biotic controls on diversification have been proposed to explain this diversity increase: ( 1) geochemical coupling between terrestrial grasslands and marine ecosystems through the global silicon cycle; and ( 2) competitive displacement of other phytoplankton lineages. However, these hypotheses have not been tested using sampling-standardized fossil data. Here we show that reconstructions of species diversity in marine phytoplankton reject these proposed controls and suggest a new pattern for oceanic diatom diversity across the Cenozoic. Peak species diversity in marine planktonic diatoms occurred at the Eocene - Oligocene boundary and was followed by a pronounced decline, from which diversity has not recovered. Although the roles of abiotic and biotic drivers of diversification remain unclear, major features of oceanic diatom evolution are decoupled from both grassland expansion and competition among phytoplankton groups.","[Rabosky, Daniel L.] Cornell Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Rabosky, Daniel L.] Cornell Lab Ornithol, Fuller Evolutionary Biol Program, Ithaca, NY 14850 USA; [Sorhannus, Ulf] Edinboro Univ Penn, Dept Biol & Hlth Serv, Edinboro, PA 16444 USA","Rabosky, DL (reprint author), Cornell Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",DLR32@cornell.edu,"Rabosky, Daniel/G-4530-2015",,NSF-OSIEE-0612855; Microsoft Corporation,"We thank J.

Vocal communication in a noisy bird colony and vocal learning of a specific song template both require the ability to monitor auditory feedback(3,4) to distinguish self-generated vocalizations from external sounds and to identify mismatches between the developing song and a memorized template acquired from a tutor(5). However, neurons that respond to auditory feedback from vocal output have not been found in song-control areas despite intensive searching(6-8). Here we investigate feedback processing outside the traditional song system, in single auditory forebrain neurons of juvenile zebra finches that were in a late developmental stage of song learning. Overall, we found similarity of spike responses during singing and during playback of the bird's own song, with song responses commonly leading by a few milliseconds. However, brief time- locked acoustic perturbations of auditory feedback revealed complex sensitivity that could not be predicted from passive playback responses. Some neurons that responded to playback perturbations did not respond to song perturbations, which is reminiscent of sensory- motor mirror neurons(8,9). By contrast, some neurons were highly feedback sensitive in that they responded vigorously to song perturbations, but not to unperturbed songs or perturbed playback. These findings suggest that a computational function of forebrain auditory areas may be to detect errors between actual feedback and mirrored feedback deriving from an internal model of the bird's own song or that of its tutor. Such feedback- sensitive spikes could constitute the key signals that trigger adaptive motor responses to song disruptions(10,11) or reinforce exploratory motor gestures for vocal learning(12).","[Keller, Georg B.; Hahnloser, Richard H.

It has long been proposed that the number of memory CD8 T cells in the host is inflexible, and that individual cells are constantly competing for limited space(2,3). Consequently, vaccines that introduce over- abundant quantities of memory CD8 T cells specific for an agent of interest could have catastrophic consequences for the host by displacing memory CD8 T cells specific for all previous infections(4-6). To test this paradigm, we developed a vaccination regimen in mice that introduced as many new long- lived memory CD8 T cells specific for a single vaccine antigen as there were memory CD8 T cells in the host before vaccination. Here we show that, in contrast to expectations, the size of the memory CD8 T- cell compartment doubled to accommodate these new cells, a change due solely to the addition of effector memory CD8 T cells. This increase did not affect the number of CD4 T cells, B cells or naive CD8 T cells, and pre- existing memory CD8 T cells specific for a previously encountered infection were largely preserved. Thus, the number of effector memory CD8 T cells in the mammalian host adapts according to immunological experience. Developing vaccines that abundantly introduce new memory CD8 T cells should not necessarily ablate pre- existing immunity to other infections.","[Vezys, Vaiva; Casey, Kerry A.; Masopust, David] Univ Minnesota, Dept Microbiol, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA; [Vezys, Vaiva; Casey, Kerry A.; Masopust, David] Univ Minnesota, Ctr Immunol, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA; [Vezys, Vaiva; Lanier, Gibson; Ahmed, Rafi; Masopust, David] Emory Univ, Sch Med, Emory Vaccine Ctr, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA; [Yates, Andrew; Antia, Rustom] Emory Univ, Dept Biol, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA","Masopust, D (reprint author), Univ Minnesota, Dept Microbiol, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA.",masopust@umn.edu,"Casey, Kerry/B-5274-2011; vezys, vaiva/N-3144-2013","Vezys, Vaiva/0000-0002-2520-809X",University of Minnesota Medical School; NIH [AI30048],"We thank S.

Here we show a marked activation of the interleukin ( IL)- 6 signalling pathway in this tumour type; sequencing candidate genes pinpointed this response to somatic gain- of- function mutations in the IL6ST gene, which encodes the signalling co- receptor gp130. Indeed, 60% of inflammatory hepatocellular adenomas harbour small in- frame deletions that target the binding site of gp130 for IL- 6, and expression of four different gp130 mutants in hepatocellular cells activates signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 ( STAT3) in the absence of ligand. Furthermore, analysis of hepatocellular carcinomas revealed that rare gp130 alterations are always accompanied by beta-catenin-activating mutations, suggesting a cooperative effect of these signalling pathways in the malignant conversion of hepatocytes. The recurrent gain- of function gp130 mutations in these human hepatocellular adenomas fully explains activation of the acute inflammatory phase observed in tumourous hepatocytes, and suggests that similar alterations may occur in other inflammatory epithelial tumours with STAT3 activation.","[Rebouissou, Sandra; Amessou, Mohamed; Couchy, Gabrielle; Poussin, Karine; Pilati, Camilla; Zucman-Rossi, Jessica] INSERM, Genom Fonct Tumeurs Solides U674, F-75010 Paris, France; [Rebouissou, Sandra; Amessou, Mohamed; Couchy, Gabrielle; Poussin, Karine; Pilati, Camilla; Zucman-Rossi, Jessica] Univ Paris 07, Inst Univ Hematol, F-75010 Paris, France; [Imbeaud, Sandrine] CNRS, Arrays IMAGE Genexpress Funct Genom & Syst Biol H, UMR 7091, F-94801 Villejuif, France; [Imbeaud, Sandrine] Univ Paris 06, F-94801 Villejuif, France; [Imbeaud, Sandrine] CNRS, Ctr Genet Mol, Gif Orsay DNA Microarray Platform GODMAP, UPR 2167, F-91198 Gif Sur Yvette, France; [Imbeaud, Sandrine] Univ Paris 11, F-91198 Gif Sur Yvette, France; [Izard, Tina] Scripps Res Inst, Dept Canc Biol, Jupiter, FL 33458 USA; [Balabaud, Charles; Bioulac-Sage, Paulette] INSERM, U889, F-33076 Bordeaux, France; [Balabaud, Charles; Bioulac-Sage, Paulette] Univ Bordeaux 2, IFR66, F-33076 Bordeaux, France; [Balabaud, Charles] Hop St Andre, Serv Hepatol, CHU Bordeaux, F-33076 Bordeaux, France; [Bioulac-Sage, Paulette] Hop Pellegrin, Serv Anat Pathol, CHU Bordeaux, F-33076 Bordeaux, France","Zucman-Rossi, J (reprint author), INSERM, Genom Fonct Tumeurs Solides U674, F-75010 Paris, France.",zucman@cephb.fr,"Rebouissou, Sandra/O-5938-2017","Rebouissou, Sandra/0000-0003-0188-2271; Imbeaud, Sandrine/0000-0001-8439-6732; zucman-rossi, Jessica/0000-0002-5687-0334; Pilati, Camilla/0000-0002-1781-5180","Inserm (Reseaux de Recherche Clinique et Reseaux de Recherche en Sante des Populations); Ligue Nationale Contre le Cancer (""Cartes d'Identite des Tumeurs'' program); ARC [5158]; Fondation de France; la Ligue Nationale Contre le Cancer; Inca; Inserm; Bordeaux Hospital; National Institutes of Health [GM071596, AI055894, AI067949]","We are indebted to P.

Otolith number, size and placement are under strict developmental control, but the mechanisms that ensure otolith assembly atop specific cells of the sensory epithelium are unclear. Here we demonstrate that cilia motility is required for normal otolith assembly and localization. Using in vivo video microscopy, we show that motile tether cilia at opposite poles of the otic vesicle create fluid vortices that attract otolith precursor particles, thereby biasing an otherwise random distribution to direct localized otolith seeding on tether cilia. Independent knockdown of subunits for the dynein regulatory complex and outer- arm dynein disrupt cilia motility, leading to defective otolith biogenesis. These results demonstrate a requirement for the dynein regulatory complex in vertebrates and show that cilia- driven flow is a key epigenetic factor in controlling otolith biomineralization.","[Colantonio, Jessica R.; Hill, Kent L.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Microbiol Immunol & Mol Genet, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Langenbacher, Adam D.; Chen, Jau-Nian] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Mol Cell & Dev Biol, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Chen, Jau-Nian; Hill, Kent L.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Inst Mol Biol, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Vermot, Julien; Wu, David; Fraser, Scott] CALTECH, Beckman Inst, Biol Imaging Ctr, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA","Hill, KL (reprint author), Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Microbiol Immunol & Mol Genet, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.",kenthill@mednet.ucla.edu,"Vermot, Julien/I-6568-2016","Chen, Jau-Nian/0000-0001-8807-3607; , Julien/0000-0002-8924-732X","Human Frontier Science Program; NIH Medical Scientist Training Program at UCLA/Caltech; NIH RSDA [M07185]; Warsaw Fellowship; NSF; NIH [R01 HL081799, R01AI52348]; Beckman Young Investigator Award","We are grateful to R.

When Caenorhabditis elegans larvae enter dauer they arrest feeding but remain active and motile, yet become stress- resistant, extremely long- lived and non- ageing(1). Entry into dauer is associated with a reduction in insulin- like signalling, the accumulation of nutritive resources and a concomitant global change in metabolism(2-5), yet the precise molecular and physiological processes that enable long- term survival in the absence of caloric intake remain largely unknown. We show here that C. elegans larvae that lack LKB1/ AMPK (AMP-activated protein kinase) signalling enter dauer normally, but then rapidly consume their stored energy and prematurely expire following vital organ failure. We found that this signalling pathway acts in adipose- like tissues to downregulate triglyceride hydrolysis so that these lipid reserves are rationed to last the entire duration of the arrest. Indeed, the downregulation of adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL-1) activity suppresses both the rapid depletion of stored lipids and reduced life span of AMPK mutant dauers, while AMPK directly phosphorylates ATGL-1. Finally, we show that the slow release of energy during dauer is critical for appropriate long- term osmoregulation, which fails as triglyceride resources become depleted. These mechanisms may be essential for survival through diapause, hibernation, or long- term fasting in diverse organisms and may also underlie AMPK- dependent life span extension.","[Narbonne, Patrick; Roy, Richard] McGill Univ, Dept Biol, Montreal, PQ H3A 1B1, Canada","Roy, R (reprint author), McGill Univ, Dept Biol, 1205 Doctor Penfield Ave, Montreal, PQ H3A 1B1, Canada.",richard.roy@mcgill.ca,,,Canadian Cancer Society; Canadian Institutes of Health Research,"We thank A.

It is now necessary to turn attention towards understanding how these sites work in combination to influence gene expression. Quantitative models that accurately predict gene expression from promoter sequence(3-5) will be a crucial part of solving this problem. Here we present such a model, based on the analysis of synthetic promoter libraries in yeast ( Saccharomyces cerevisiae). Thermodynamic models based only on the equilibrium binding of transcription factors to DNA and to each other captured a large fraction of the variation in expression in every library. Thermodynamic analysis of these libraries uncovered several phenomena in our system, including cooperativity and the effects of weak binding sites. When applied to the S. cerevisiae genome, a model of repression by Mig1 ( which was trained on synthetic promoters) predicts a number of Mig1- regulated genes that lack significant Mig1- binding sites in their promoters. The success of the thermodynamic approach suggests that the information encoded by combinations of cis- regulatory sites is interpreted primarily through simple protein - DNA and protein - protein interactions, with complicated biochemical reactions - such as nucleosome modifications - being downstream events. Quantitative analyses of synthetic promoter libraries will be an important tool in unravelling the rules underlying combinatorial cis- regulation.","[Gertz, Jason; Cohen, Barak A.] Washington Univ, Sch Med, Ctr Genome Sci, Dept Genet, St Louis, MO 63108 USA; [Siggia, Eric D.] Rockefeller Univ, Ctr Studies Phys & Biol, New York, NY 10021 USA","Cohen, BA (reprint author), Washington Univ, Sch Med, Ctr Genome Sci, Dept Genet, 4444 Forest Park Ave, St Louis, MO 63108 USA.",cohen@genetics.wustl.edu,,"Gertz, Jason/0000-0001-7568-6789","NIH [R01 GM078222]; NSF [DMR0129848, DGE-0202737]","We thank R.

Aromatase inhibitors therefore constitute a front-line therapy for oestrogen- dependent breast cancer(3,4). In a three-step process, each step requiring 1 mol of O-2, 1 mol of NADPH, and coupling with its redox partner cytochrome P450 reductase, aromatase converts androstenedione, testosterone and 16 alpha-hydroxytestosterone to oestrone, 17 beta-oestradiol and 17 beta, 16 alpha-oestriol, respectively(1-3). The first two steps are C19- methyl hydroxylation steps, and the third involves the aromatization of the steroid A- ring, unique to aromatase. Whereas most P450s are not highly substrate selective, it is the hallmark androgenic specificity that sets aromatase apart. The structure of this enzyme of the endoplasmic reticulum membrane has remained unknown for decades, hindering elucidation of the biochemical mechanism. Here we present the crystal structure of human placental aromatase, the only natural mammalian, full- length P450 and P450 in hormone biosynthetic pathways to be crystallized so far. Unlike the active sites of many microsomal P450s that metabolize drugs and xenobiotics, aromatase has an androgen- specific cleft that binds the androstenedione molecule snugly. Hydrophobic and polar residues exquisitely complement the steroid backbone. The locations of catalytically important residues shed light on the reaction mechanism. The relative juxtaposition of the hydrophobic amino- terminal region and the opening to the catalytic cleft shows why membrane anchoring is necessary for the lipophilic substrates to gain access to the active site. The molecular basis for the enzyme's androgenic specificity and unique catalytic mechanism can be used for developing next- generation aromatase inhibitors.","[Ghosh, Debashis; Griswold, Jennifer; Erman, Mary; Pangborn, Walter] Hauptman Woodward Res Inst, Buffalo, NY 14203 USA; [Ghosh, Debashis] Roswell Pk Canc Inst, Buffalo, NY 14263 USA","Ghosh, D (reprint author), Hauptman Woodward Res Inst, 700 Ellicott St, Buffalo, NY 14203 USA.",ghosh@hwi.buffalo.edu,,,"National Institutes of Health [GM62794, GM59450]","We thank Y.

A defining characteristic of stem cells is their capacity to self- renew, which is markedly extended in leukaemia stem cells. The underlying molecular mechanisms, however, are largely unknown. Here we demonstrate that expression of the cell- cycle inhibitor p21 is indispensable for maintaining self- renewal of leukaemia stem cells. Expression of leukaemia- associated oncogenes in mouse haematopoietic stem cells ( HSCs) induces DNA damage and activates a p21- dependent cellular response, which leads to reversible cell- cycle arrest and DNA repair. Activated p21 is critical in preventing excess DNA- damage accumulation and functional exhaustion of leukaemic stem cells. These data unravel the oncogenic potential of p21 and suggest that inhibition of DNA repair mechanisms might function as potent strategy for the eradication of the slowly proliferating leukaemia stem cells.","[Viale, Andrea; De Franco, Francesca; Orleth, Annette; Cambiaghi, Valeria; Giuliani, Virginia; Bossi, Daniela; Ronchini, Chiara; Ronzoni, Simona; Muradore, Ivan; Monestiroli, Silvia; Gobbi, Alberto; Alcalay, Myriam; Minucci, Saverio; Pelicci, Pier Giuseppe] European Inst Oncol, Dept Expt Oncol, I-20141 Milan, Italy; [De Franco, Francesca; Orleth, Annette] Univ Perugia, Dipartimento Med Clin & Sperimentale, Monteluce Policlin, I-06100 Perugia, Italy; [Minucci, Saverio] Univ Milan, Dipartimento Sci Biomol & Biotecnol, I-20100 Milan, Italy; [Alcalay, Myriam; Pelicci, Pier Giuseppe] Univ Milan, Dipartimento Med Chirurg & Odontoiatria, I-20100 Milan, Italy","Viale, A (reprint author), European Inst Oncol, Dept Expt Oncol, IFOM IEO Campus, I-20141 Milan, Italy.",andrea.viale@ifom-ieo-campus.it; piergiuseppe.pelicci@ifom-ieo-campus.it,"Minucci, Saverio/J-9669-2012; Ronchini, Chiara/K-3935-2013; Bossi, Daniela/G-2401-2015; Alcalay, Myriam/B-3182-2016","Ronchini, Chiara/0000-0003-3908-4021; Bossi, Daniela/0000-0002-8507-6754; Alcalay, Myriam/0000-0002-5558-4272","Italian Association on Cancer Research; Ministero Italiano della Salute, Cariplo; European Community (FP6: EPITRON and GENICA); Vollaro Foundation","We thank L.

The inability to repair breaks leads to genomic instability, carcinogenesis and cell death. During the double- strand break response, mammalian chromatin undergoes reorganization demarcated by H2A.X Ser 139 phosphorylation (gamma-H2A.X). However, the regulation of gamma-H2A.X phosphorylation and its precise role in chromatin remodelling during the repair process remain unclear. Here we report a new regulatory mechanism mediated by WSTF ( Williams - Beuren syndrome transcription factor, also known as BAZ1B) - a component of the WICH complex (WSTF-ISWI ATP- dependent chromatin- remodelling complex). We show that WSTF has intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity by means of a domain that shares no sequence homology to any known kinase fold. We show that WSTF phosphorylates Tyr 142 of H2A.X, and that WSTF activity has an important role in regulating several events that are critical for the DNA damage response. Our work demonstrates a new mechanism that regulates the DNA damage response and expands our knowledge of domains that contain intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity.","[Xiao, Andrew; Shechter, David; Ahn, Sung Hee; Allis, C.

But self- gravity's role at earlier times ( and on larger length scales, such as similar to 1 parsec) is unclear; some molecular cloud simulations that do not include self- gravity suggest that 'turbulent fragmentation' alone is sufficient to create a mass distribution of dense cores that resembles, and sets, the stellar initial mass function(2). Here we report a 'dendrogram' (hierarchical tree- diagram) analysis that reveals that self- gravity plays a significant role over the full range of possible scales traced by (13)CO observations in the L1448 molecular cloud, but not everywhere in the observed region. In particular, more than 90 per cent of the compact 'pre- stellar cores' traced by peaks of dust emission(3) are projected on the sky within one of the dendrogram's self- gravitating 'leaves'. As these peaks mark the locations of already- forming stars, or of those probably about to form, a self- gravitating cocoon seems a critical condition for their existence. Turbulent fragmentation simulations without self- gravity even of unmagnetized isothermal material - can yield mass and velocity power spectra very similar to what is observed in clouds like L1448. But a dendrogram of such a simulation(4) shows that nearly all the gas in it ( much more than in the observations) appears to be self- gravitating. A potentially significant role for gravity in ` non- self- gravitating' simulations suggests inconsistency in simulation assumptions and output, and that it is necessary to include self- gravity in any realistic simulation of the star- formation process on subparsec scales.","[Goodman, Alyssa A.; Borkin, Michelle A.; Halle, Michael; Kauffmann, Jens] Harvard Univ, Initiat Innovat Comp, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Goodman, Alyssa A.; Rosolowsky, Erik W.; Foster, Jonathan B.; Kauffmann, Jens; Pineda, Jaime E.] Harvard Smithsonian Ctr Astrophys, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Rosolowsky, Erik W.] Univ British Columbia, Dept Phys, Kelowna, BC V1V 1V7, Canada; [Halle, Michael] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Brigham & Womens Hosp, Surg Planning Lab, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Halle, Michael] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Brigham & Womens Hosp, Dept Radiol, Boston, MA 02115 USA","Goodman, AA (reprint author), Harvard Univ, Initiat Innovat Comp, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",agoodman@cfa.harvard.edu,"Pineda, Jaime/J-7405-2013; Goodman, Alyssa/A-6007-2010","Pineda, Jaime/0000-0002-3972-1978; Goodman, Alyssa/0000-0003-1312-0477",National Institutes of Health [U54-EB005149]; National Science Foundation [AST-0502605],"We thank A.

In most circumstances, the measurement uncertainty is distributed equally between pairs of complementary properties; this leads to the 'standard quantumlimit' for measurement resolution. Using a technique known as 'squeezing', it is possible to reduce the uncertainty of one desired property below the standard quantumlimit at the expense of increasing that of the complementary one. Squeezing is already being used to enhance the sensitivity of gravity- wave detectors(1) and may play a critical role in other high precision applications, such as atomic clocks(2) and optical communications(3). Spin squeezing ( the squeezing of angular momentum variables) is a powerful tool, particularly in the context of quantum light - matter interfaces(4-9). Although impressive gains in squeezing have been made, optical spin- squeezed systems are still many orders of magnitude away from the maximum possible squeezing, known as the Heisenberg uncertainty limit. Here we demonstrate how an optical system can be squeezed essentially all the way to this fundamental bound. Weconstruct spin- squeezed states by overlapping three indistinguishable photons in an optical fibre and manipulating their polarization ( spin), resulting in the formation of a squeezed composite particle known as a 'triphoton'. The symmetry properties of polarization imply that the measured triphoton states can be most naturally represented by quasi- probability distributions on the surface of a sphere. In this work we show that the spherical topology of polarization imposes a limit on how much squeezing can occur, leading to the quasi- probability distributions wrapping around the sphere - a phenomenon we term 'oversqueezing'. Our observations of spin- squeezing in the few- photon regime could lead to new quantum resources for enhanced measurement, lithography and information processing that can be precisely engineered photon- by- photon.","[Shalm, L.

Optical tweezers(1-4) are excellent tools for transporting particles ranging in size fromseveral micrometres to a few hundred nanometres. Manipulation of dielectric objects with much smaller diameters, however, requires stronger optical confinement and higher intensities than can be provided by these diffraction- limited(5) systems. Here we present an approach to optofluidic transport that overcomes these limitations, using sub-wavelength liquid- core slot waveguides(6). The technique simultaneously makes use of near- field optical forces to confine matter inside the waveguide and scattering/ adsorption forces to transport it. The ability of the slot waveguide to condense the accessible electromagnetic energy to scales as small as 60 nm allows us also to overcome the fundamental diffraction problem. We apply the approach here to the trapping and transport of 75- nm dielectric nanoparticles and lambda-DNA molecules. Because trapping occurs along a line, rather than at a point as with traditional point traps(7,8), the method provides the ability to handle extended biomolecules directly. We also carry out a detailed numerical analysis that relates the near- field optical forces to release kinetics. We believe that the architecture demonstrated here will help to bridge the gap between optical manipulation and nanofluidics.","[Moore, Sean D.; Klug, Matthew; Erickson, David] Cornell Univ, Sibley Sch Mech & Aerosp Engn, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Yang, Allen H.

The seismological signature of water within the forearc mantle wedge is evident in anomalies with low seismic shear velocity marking serpentinization(5-7). However, seismological observations bearing on the presence of water within the subducting plate itself are less well documented. Here we use converted teleseismic waves to obtain observations of anomalously high Poisson's ratios within the subducted oceanic crust from the Cascadia continental margin to its intersection with forearc mantle. On the basis of pressure, temperature and compositional considerations, the elevated Poisson's ratios indicate that water is pervasively present in fluid format pore pressures near lithostatic values. Combined with observations of a strong negative velocity contrast at the top of the oceanic crust, our results imply that the megathrust is a low- permeability boundary. The transition from a low- to high- permeability plate interface down dip into the mantle wedge is explained by hydrofracturing of the seal by volume changes across the interface caused by the onset of crustal eclogitization and mantle serpentinization. These results may have important implications for our understanding of seismogenesis, subduction zone structure and the mechanism of episodic tremor and slip.","[Audet, Pascal; Bostock, Michael G.; Christensen, Nikolas I.; Peacock, Simon M.] Univ British Columbia, Dept Earth & Ocean Sci, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada; [Christensen, Nikolas I.] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Geol & Geophys, Madison, WI 53706 USA","Audet, P (reprint author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Seismol Lab, 215 McCone Hall, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",paudet@berkeley.edu,,,,,,30,229,230,10,62,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,1-Jan,2009,457,7225,,,,,76,78,,10.1038/nature07650,,3,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,389OR,WOS:000262104900033,19122639,No,Y,N,11/20/17

Our behaviour towards other people depends not only on what they have done to us but also on what they have done to others. Indirect reciprocity works through reputation(5-17). The standard model of indirect reciprocity offers a binary choice: people can either cooperate or defect. Cooperation implies a cost for the donor and a benefit for the recipient. Defection has no cost and yields no benefit. Currently there is considerable interest in studying the effect of costly (or altruistic) punishment on human behaviour(18-25). Punishment implies a cost for the punished person. Costly punishment means that the punisher also pays a cost. It has been suggested that costly punishment between individuals can promote cooperation. Here we study the role of costly punishment in an explicit model of indirect reciprocity. We analyse all social norms, which depend on the action of the donor and the reputation of the recipient. We allow errors in assigning reputation and study gossip as a mechanism for establishing coherence. We characterize all strategies that allow the evolutionary stability of cooperation. Some of those strategies use costly punishment; others do not. We find that punishment strategies typically reduce the average payoff of the population. Consequently, there is only a small parameter region where costly punishment leads to an efficient equilibrium. In most cases the population does better by not using costly punishment. The efficient strategy for indirect reciprocity is to withhold help for defectors rather than punishing them.","[Ohtsuki, Hisashi] Tokyo Inst Technol, Dept Value & Decis Sci, Tokyo 1528552, Japan; [Ohtsuki, Hisashi] Japan Sci & Technol Agcy, PRESTO, Kawaguchi, Saitama 3320012, Japan; [Iwasa, Yoh] Kyushu Univ, Dept Biol, Fac Sci, Fukuoka 8128581, Japan; [Nowak, Martin A.] Harvard Univ, Program Evolutionary Dynam, Dept Organism & Evolut Biol, Dept Math, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA","Ohtsuki, H (reprint author), Tokyo Inst Technol, Dept Value & Decis Sci, Tokyo 1528552, Japan.",ohtsuki.h.aa@m.titech.ac.jp,"Nowak, Martin/A-6977-2008; Iwasa, Yoh/G-5368-2010; U-ID, Kyushu/C-5291-2016","Iwasa, Yoh/0000-0003-0691-1852; ",John Templeton Foundation; Japan Society for the Promotion of Science; NSF/NIH joint program in mathematical biology; NIH [R01GM078986],"Support from the John Templeton Foundation, the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, the NSF/NIH joint program in mathematical biology (NIH grant R01GM078986) and J.

Essential to this process is the formation of abstract representations that generalize from specific instances of visual input. A common view holds that neurons in the early visual system signal conjunctions of image features(1,2), but how these produce invariant representations is poorly understood. Here we propose that to generalize over similar images, higher- level visual neurons encode statistical variations that characterize local image regions. We present a model in which neural activity encodes the probability distribution most consistent with a given image. Trained on natural images, the model generalizes by learning a compact set of dictionary elements for image distributions typically encountered in natural scenes. Model neurons show a diverse range of properties observed in cortical cells. These results provide a new functional explanation for nonlinear effects in complex cells(3-6) and offer insight into coding strategies in primary visual cortex (V1) and higher visual areas.","[Karklin, Yan; Lewicki, Michael S.] Carnegie Mellon Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA; [Karklin, Yan; Lewicki, Michael S.] Carnegie Mellon Univ, Ctr Neural Basis Cognit, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA","Karklin, Y (reprint author), NYU, Ctr Neural Sci, New York, NY 10003 USA.",yan.karklin@nyu.edu; michael.lewicki@case.edu,,,"Department of Energy; Computational Science Graduate Fellowship; National Science Foundation [0413152, 0705677]; Office of Naval Research under the Multidisciplinary University Research Initiative [N000140710747]","This work was supported by the Department of Energy through the Computational Science Graduate Fellowship (to Y.K.), the National Science Foundation Grant under grant numbers 0413152 and 0705677 (to M.S.L.) and the Office of Naval Research under the Multidisciplinary University Research Initiative N000140710747.",,31,90,96,0,12,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,1-Jan,2009,457,7225,,,,,83,U85,,10.1038/nature07481,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,389OR,WOS:000262104900035,19020501,No,,,11/20/17

Consistent with these results, preclinical studies have demonstrated that rAd5 vectors expressing simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) Gag failed to reduce peak or setpoint viral loads after SIV challenge of rhesus monkeys ( Macaca mulatta) that lacked the protective MHC class I allele Mamu-A*01 ( ref. 3). Here we show that an improved T- cell- based vaccine regimen using two serologically distinct adenovirus vectors afforded substantially improved protective efficacy in this challenge model. In particular, a heterologous rAd26 prime/rAd5 boost vaccine regimen expressing SIV Gag elicited cellular immune responses with augmented magnitude, breadth and polyfunctionality as compared with the homologous rAd5 regimen. After SIV(MAC251) challenge, monkeys vaccinated with the rAd26/rAd5 regimen showed a 1.4 log reduction of peak and a 2.4 log reduction of setpoint viral loads as well as decreased AIDS- related mortality as compared with control animals. These data demonstrate that durable partial immune control of a pathogenic SIV challenge for more than 500 days can be achieved by a T- cell- based vaccine in Mamu-A*01-negative rhesus monkeys in the absence of a homologous Env antigen. These findings have important implications for the development of next- generation T- cell- based vaccine candidates for HIV- 1.","[Liu, Jinyan; O'Brien, Kara L.; Lynch, Diana M.; Simmons, Nathaniel L.; La Porte, Annalena; Riggs, Ambryice M.; Abbink, Peter; Coffey, Rory T.; Grandpre, Lauren E.; Seaman, Michael S.; Barouch, Dan H.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Beth Israel Deaconess Med Ctr, Div Viral Pathogenesis, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Landucci, Gary; Forthal, Donald N.] Univ Calif Irvine, Sch Med, Irvine, CA 92697 USA; [Montefiori, David C.] Duke Univ, Med Ctr, Durham, NC 27710 USA; [Carville, Angela; Mansfield, Keith G.] New England Reg Primate Res Ctr, Southborough, MA 01772 USA; [Havenga, Menzo J.] TNO Biosci, NL-2301 CE Leiden, Netherlands; [Pau, Maria G.; Goudsmit, Jaap] Crucell Holland BV, NL-2301 CA Leiden, Netherlands","Barouch, DH (reprint author), Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Beth Israel Deaconess Med Ctr, Div Viral Pathogenesis, Boston, MA 02215 USA.",dbarouch@bidmc.harvard.edu,,"Simmons, Nathaniel/0000-0001-6080-2783","NIH [AI066305, AI066924, AI078526, AI030034, RR000168]","We thank R.

Using a combination of high-resolution confocal microscopy and two- photon video imaging of individual haematopoietic cells in the calvarium bone marrow of living mice over time, we examine the relationship of haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells to blood vessels, osteoblasts and endosteal surface as they home and engraft in irradiated and c-Kit-receptor-deficient recipient mice. Osteoblasts were enmeshed in microvessels and relative positioning of stem/ progenitor cells within this complex tissue was nonrandom and dynamic. Both cell autonomous and non- autonomous factors influenced primitive cell localization. Different haematopoietic cell subsets localized to distinct locations according to the stage of differentiation. When physiological challenges drove either engraftment or expansion, bone- marrow stem/ progenitor cells assumed positions in close proximity to bone and osteoblasts.

Their interrelationships and interactions with HSCs in vivo remain largely unknown. Here we report the use of a newly developed ex vivo real- time imaging technology and immunoassaying to trace the homing of purified green-fluorescent-protein- expressing (GFP(+)) HSCs. We found that transplanted HSCs tended to home to the endosteum (an inner bone surface) in irradiated mice, but were randomly distributed and unstable in non- irradiated mice. Moreover, GFP(+) HSCs were more frequently detected in the trabecular bone area compared with compact bone area, and this was validated by live imaging bioluminescence driven by the stem- cell- leukaemia ( Scl) promoter enhancer(7). HSCs home to bone marrow through the vascular system. We found that the endosteum is well vascularized and that vasculature is frequently localized near N-cadherin(+) pre-osteoblastic cells, a known niche component. By monitoring individual HSC behaviour using real- time imaging, we found that a portion of the homed HSCs underwent active division in the irradiated mice, coinciding with their expansion as measured by flow assay. Thus, in contrast to central marrow, the endosteum formed a special zone, which normally maintains HSCs but promotes their expansion in response to bone marrow damage.","[Miller, Diana; Feldman, Ricardo A.] Univ Maryland, Sch Med, Dept Microbiol & Immunol, Baltimore, MD 21201 USA; [Miller, Diana; Feldman, Ricardo A.] Univ Maryland, Sch Med, Greenebaum Canc Ctr, Baltimore, MD 21201 USA; [Xie, Yucai; Yin, Tong; Wiegraebe, Winfried; He, Xi C.; Stark, Danny; Perko, Katherine; Alexander, Richard; Schwartz, Joel; Grindley, Justin C.; Park, Jungeun; Haug, Jeff S.; Wunderlich, Joshua P.; Li, Hua; Zhang, Simon; Johnson, Teri; Li, Linheng] Stowers Inst Med Res, Kansas City, MO 64110 USA; [Xie, Yucai] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Med, Dept Cardiol, Shanghai Rui Jin Hosp, Shanghai 200025, Peoples R China; [Li, Linheng] Univ Kansas, Med Ctr, Dept Pathol & Lab Med, Kansas City, KS 66160 USA","Feldman, RA (reprint author), Univ Maryland, Sch Med, Dept Microbiol & Immunol, Baltimore, MD 21201 USA.",rfeldman@umaryland.edu; lil@stowers-institute.org,,,DOD [W81XWH-04-1-0801]; DRIF Award; University of Maryland; Stowers Institute for Medical Research,"We appreciate scientific support from R.

To understand how cancer cells affect the inflammatory microenvironment, we conducted a biochemical screen for macrophage- activating factors secreted by metastatic carcinomas. Here we show that, among the cell lines screened, Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC)(3) were the most potent macrophage activators leading to production of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumour-necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) through activation of the Toll-like receptor (TLR) family members(4) TLR2 and TLR6. Both TNF-alpha and TLR2 were found to be required for LLC metastasis. Biochemical purification of LLC- conditioned medium ( LCM) led to identification of the extracellular matrix proteoglycan versican, which is upregulated in many human tumours including lung cancer(5,6), as a macrophage activator that acts through TLR2 and its coreceptors TLR6 and CD14. By activating TLR2: TLR6 complexes and inducing TNF-alpha secretion by myeloid cells, versican strongly enhances LLC metastatic growth. These results explain how advanced cancer cells usurp components of the host innate immune system, including bone- marrow- derived myeloid progenitors(7), to generate an inflammatory microenvironment hospitable for metastatic growth.","[Kim, Sunhwa; Takahashi, Hiroyuki; Lin, Wan-Wan; Descargues, Pascal; Grivennikov, Sergei; Kim, Youngjun; Luo, Jun-Li; Karin, Michael] Univ Calif San Diego, Sch Med, Dept Pharmacol, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Kim, Sunhwa; Takahashi, Hiroyuki; Lin, Wan-Wan; Descargues, Pascal; Grivennikov, Sergei; Kim, Youngjun; Luo, Jun-Li; Karin, Michael] Univ Calif San Diego, Sch Med, Ctr Canc, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Lin, Wan-Wan] Natl Taiwan Univ, Coll Med, Dept Pharmacol, Taipei 10764, Taiwan","Karin, M (reprint author), Univ Calif San Diego, Sch Med, Dept Pharmacol, 9500 Gilman Dr, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.",karinoffice@ucsd.edu,,"Lin, Wan Wan/0000-0002-3207-734X",International Human Frontier Science Program Organization; National Cancer Institute-sponsored Cancer Therapeutic Training Program; Ruth L.

This process starts by the trapping of a substrate protein on hydrophobic surfaces in the central cavity of a GroEL ring(6-10). Then, binding of ATP and co- chaperonin GroES to that ring ejects the non- native protein from its binding sites, through forced unfolding or other major conformational changes, and encloses it in a hydrophilic chamber for folding(11-15). ATP hydrolysis and subsequent ATP binding to the opposite ring trigger dissociation of the chamber and release of the substrate protein(3). The bacteriophage T4 requires its own version of GroES, gp31, which forms a taller folding chamber, to fold the major viral capsid protein gp23 ( refs 16-20). Polypeptides are known to fold inside the chaperonin complex, but the conformation of an encapsulated protein has not previously been visualized. Here we present structures of gp23-chaperonin complexes, showing both the initial captured state and the final, close-to-native state with gp23 encapsulated in the folding chamber. Although the chamber is expanded, it is still barely large enough to contain the elongated gp23 monomer, explaining why the GroEL-GroES complex is not able to fold gp23 and showing how the chaperonin structure distorts to enclose a large, physiological substrate protein.","[Clare, D.

This cationic channel is known to be permanently activated by protons(5). The structure is arranged as a funnel- shaped transmembrane pore widely open on the outer side and lined by hydrophobic residues. On the inner side, a 5 angstrom constriction matches with rings of hydrophilic residues that are likely to contribute to the ionic selectivity(6-9). Structural comparison with ELIC, a bacterial homologue from Erwinia chrysanthemi solved in a presumed closed conformation(10), shows a wider pore where the narrow hydrophobic constriction found in ELIC is removed. Comparative analysis of GLIC and ELIC reveals, in concert, a rotation of each extracellular beta-sandwich domain as a rigid body, interface rearrangements, and a reorganization of the transmembrane domain, involving a tilt of the M2 and M3 alpha-helices away from the pore axis. These data are consistent with a model of pore opening based on both quaternary twist and tertiary deformation.","[Nury, Hugues; Delarue, Marc] Inst Pasteur, Unit Struct Dynam & Macromol, CNRS, URA 2185, F-75015 Paris, France; [Bocquet, Nicolas; Nury, Hugues; Le Poupon, Chantal; Changeux, Jean-Pierre; Corringer, Pierre-Jean] Inst Pasteur, Grp Channel Receptor G5, CNRS, URA 2182, F-75015 Paris, France; [Baaden, Marc] CNRS, Inst Biol Physicochim, UPR 9080, F-75005 Paris, France","Delarue, M (reprint author), Inst Pasteur, Unit Struct Dynam & Macromol, CNRS, URA 2185, F-75015 Paris, France.",marc.delarue@pasteur.fr; pjcorrin@pasteur.fr,"Baaden, Marc/C-6623-2008","Baaden, Marc/0000-0001-6472-0486; Nury, Hugues/0000-0002-3433-256X",Region Ile-de-France; Association Francaise contre les Myopathies; College de France; Commission of the European Communities; Network of European Neuroscience Institutes,"We thank P.

The structure shows a homo- pentameric protein with a barrel- stave architecture that defines an ion- conduction pore located on the fivefold axis of symmetry. In this structure, the wide aqueous vestibule that is encircled by the extracellular ligand- binding domains of the five subunits narrows to a discontinuous pore that spans the lipid bilayer. The pore is constricted by bulky hydrophobic residues towards the extracellular side, which probably serve as barriers that prevent the diffusion of ions. This interrupted pore architecture in ELIC thus depicts a non- conducting conformation of a pentameric ligand- gated ion channel, the thermodynamically stable state in the absence of bound ligand. As ligand binding promotes pore opening in these ion channels and the specific ligand for ELIC has not yet been identified, we have turned our attention towards a homologous protein from the cyanobacterium Gloebacter violaceus ( GLIC). GLIC was shown to form proton- gated channels that are activated by a pH decrease on the extracellular side and that do not desensitize after activation(2). Both prokaryotic proteins, ELIC and GLIC form ion channels that are selective for cations over anions with poor discrimination among monovalent cations(1,2), characteristics that resemble the conduction properties of the cation- selective branch of the family that includes acetylcholine and serotonin receptors(3,4). Here we present the X- ray structure of GLIC at 3.1 angstrom resolution. The structure reveals a conformation of the channel that is distinct from ELIC and that probably resembles the open state. In combination, both structures suggest a novel gating mechanism for pentameric ligand- gated ion channels where channel opening proceeds by a change in the tilt of the pore- forming helices.","[Hilf, Ricarda J.

Diameter- tunable microgel spheres are self- assembled into a buckled triangular lattice with either up or down displacements, analogous to an antiferromagnetic Ising model on a triangular lattice. Experiment and theory reveal single- particle dynamics governed by in- plane lattice distortions that partially relieve frustration and produce ground states with zigzagging stripes and subextensive entropy, rather than the more random configurations and extensive entropy of the antiferromagnetic Ising model.

The palmitoylated Cdc42 isoform ( Cdc42- palm) differs from the canonical, prenylated form ( Cdc42- prenyl), both with regard to localization and function: Cdc42- palm concentrates in dendritic spines and has a special role in inducing these post- synaptic structures.

The DNA portion of telomeres is synthesized by the enzyme telomerase using part of an RNA subunit as a template for reverse transcription. How the mature 39 end of telomerase RNA is generated has so far remained elusive. Here we show that in Schizosaccharomyces pombe telomerase RNA transcripts must be processed to generate functional telomerase. Characterization of the maturation pathway uncovered an unexpected role for the spliceosome, which normally catalyses splicing of pre- messenger RNA. The first spliceosomal cleavage reaction generates the mature 39 end of telomerase RNA ( TER1, the functional RNA encoded by the ter1(+) gene), releasing the active form of the RNA without exon ligation. Blocking the first step or permitting completion of splicing generates inactive forms of TER1 and causes progressive telomere shortening. We establish that 39 end processing of TER1 is critical for telomerase function and describe a previously unknown mechanism for RNA maturation that uses the ability of the spliceosome to mediate site- specific cleavage.","[Box, Jessica A.; Bunch, Jeremy T.; Tang, Wen; Baumann, Peter] Stowers Inst Med Res, Kansas City, MO 64110 USA; [Tang, Wen; Baumann, Peter] Univ Kansas, Med Ctr, Dept Mol & Integrat Physiol, Kansas City, KS 66160 USA","Baumann, P (reprint author), Stowers Inst Med Res, Kansas City, MO 64110 USA.",peb@stowers-institute.org,,"Baumann, Peter/0000-0003-4892-1485",Stowers Institute for Medical Research; Pew Scholars; Biomedical Sciences Award,"The authors thank H.

Gap- filling repair requires homologous recombination as well as Rad18- and Rad5- mediated proliferating cell nuclear antigen ( PCNA) polyubiquitylation. However, it is unclear whether these processes are coordinated, and the physical evidence for Rad18 - Rad5- dependent template switch at replication forks is still elusive. Here we show, using genetic and physical approaches, that in budding yeast ( Saccharomyces cerevisiae) Rad18 is required for the formation of X- shaped sister chromatid junctions ( SCJs) at damaged replication forks through a process involving PCNA polyubiquitylation and the ubiquitin- conjugating enzymes Mms2 and Ubc13. The Rad18 - Mms2- mediated damage- bypass through SCJs requires the small ubiquitin- like modifier ( SUMO)- conjugating enzyme Ubc9 and SUMOylated PCNA, and is coordinated with Rad51- dependent recombination events. We propose that the Rad18 - Rad5 - Mms2- dependent SCJs represent template switch events. Altogether, our results unmask a role for PCNA ubiquitylation and SUMOylation pathways in promoting transient damage- induced replication- coupled recombination events involving sister chromatids at replication forks.","[Branzei, Dana; Vanoli, Fabio; Foiani, Marco] IFOM IEO, FIRC Inst Mol Oncol Fdn, I-20139 Milan, Italy; [Foiani, Marco] Univ Milan, Dipartimento Sci Biomol & Biotecnol, I-20133 Milan, Italy","Branzei, D (reprint author), IFOM IEO, FIRC Inst Mol Oncol Fdn, Via Adamello 16, I-20139 Milan, Italy.",dana.branzei@ifom-ieo-campus.it,"Foiani, Marco/M-8234-2014; Branzei, Dana/A-2806-2015","Foiani, Marco/0000-0003-4795-834X; Branzei, Dana/0000-0002-0544-4888",Associazione Italiana per la Ricerca sul Cancro; Association for International Cancer Research; European Community GENICA; European Community DNA Repair; Telethon; MIUR; Ministry of Health; Buzzati-Traverso foundation,"We thank S.

On the basis of the understanding of the local water- maser luminosity function(5), it was expected that masers at intermediate and high redshifts would be extremely rare. However, galaxies at redshifts z > 2 might be quite different from those found locally, not least because of more frequent mergers and interaction events. Here we use gravitational lensing to search for masers at higher redshifts than would otherwise be possible, and find a water maser at redshift 2.64 in the dust- and gas- rich, gravitationally lensed type- 1 quasar MGJ0414+0534 ( refs 6 - 13). The isotropic luminosity is 10,000L.(L., solar luminosity), which is twice that of the most powerful local water maser(14) and half that of the most distant maser previously known(15). Using the locally determined luminosity function5, the probability of finding a maser this luminous associated with any single active galaxy is 10(-6). The fact that we see such a maser in the first galaxy we observe must mean that the volume densities and luminosities of masers are higher at redshift 2.64.","[Impellizzeri, C. M.

In both the iron arsenides and the copper oxides, superconductivity arises when an antiferromagnetically ordered phase has been suppressed by chemical doping(4). A universal feature of the copper oxide superconductors is the existence of a resonant magnetic excitation, localized in both energy and wavevector, within the superconducting phase(5-9). This resonance, which has also been observed in several heavy- fermion superconductors(10-12), is predicted to occur when the sign of the superconducting energy gap takes opposite values on different parts of the Fermi surface(13), an unusual gap symmetry which implies that the electron pairing interaction is repulsive at short range(14). Angle- resolved photoelectron spectroscopy shows no evidence of gap anisotropy in the iron arsenides, but such measurements are insensitive to the phase of the gap on separate parts of the Fermi surface(15). Here we report inelastic neutron scattering observations of a magnetic resonance below T-c in Ba0.6K0.4Fe2As2, a phase- sensitive measurement demonstrating that the superconducting energy gap has unconventional symmetry in the iron arsenide superconductors.","[Goremychkin, E.

Chiral catalysts are in particularly high demand, as they facilitate synthesis of enantiomerically enriched small molecules that are critical to developments in medicine, biology and materials science(1). Especially noteworthy are catalysts that promote - with otherwise inaccessible efficiency and selectivity levels - reactions demonstrated to be of great utility in chemical synthesis. Here we report a class of chiral catalysts that initiate alkene metathesis(1) with very high efficiency and enantioselectivity. Such attributes arise from structural fluxionality of the chiral catalysts and the central role that enhanced electronic factors have in the catalytic cycle. The new catalysts have a stereogenic metal centre and carry only monodentate ligands; the molybdenum- based complexes are prepared stereoselectively by a ligand exchange process involving an enantiomerically pure aryloxide, a class of ligands scarcely used in enantioselective catalysis(2,3). We demonstrate the application of the new catalysts in an enantioselective synthesis of the Aspidosperma alkaloid, quebrachamine, through an alkene metathesis reaction that cannot be promoted by any of the previously reported chiral catalysts.","[Malcolmson, Steven J.; Meek, Simon J.; Sattely, Elizabeth S.; Hoveyda, Amir H.] Boston Coll, Dept Chem, Merkert Chem Ctr, Chestnut Hill, MA 02467 USA; [Schrock, Richard R.] MIT, Dept Chem, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA","Hoveyda, AH (reprint author), Boston Coll, Dept Chem, Merkert Chem Ctr, Chestnut Hill, MA 02467 USA.",amir.hoveyda@bc.edu,"Malcolmson, Steven/C-6220-2015",,US National Institutes of Health; Institute of General Medical Sciences [GM-59426]; US National Science Foundation [DBI-0619576],"This research was supported by the US National Institutes of Health, Institute of General Medical Sciences (grant GM-59426 to A.H.H. and R.R.S.).

Models derived from analyses of active mid- ocean ridges suggest that ocean floor roughness depends on seafloor spreading rates(3), with rougher basement forming below a half- spreading rate threshold of 30 - 35 mm yr(-1) ( refs 4, 5), as well as on the local interaction of mid- ocean ridges with mantle plumes or coldspots(6). Here we present a global analysis of marine gravity- derived roughness, sediment thickness, seafloor isochrons and palaeo-spreading rates(7) of Cretaceous to Cenozoic ridge flanks. Our analysis reveals that, after eliminating effects related to spreading rate and sediment thickness, residual roughness anomalies of 5 - 20 m Gal remain over large swaths of ocean floor. We found that the roughness as a function of palaeo- spreading directions and isochron orientations(7) indicates that most of the observed excess roughness is not related to spreading obliquity, as this effect is restricted to relatively rare occurrences of very high obliquity angles (>45 degrees). Cretaceous Atlantic ocean floor, formed over mantle previously overlain by the Pangaea supercontinent, displays anomalously low roughness away from mantle plumes and is independent of spreading rates. We attribute this observation to a sub-Pangaean supercontinental mantle temperature anomaly(8) leading to slightly thicker than normal Late Jurassic and Cretaceous Atlantic crust(9), reduced brittle fracturing and smoother basement relief. In contrast, ocean crust formed above Pacific superswells(10), probably reflecting metasomatized lithosphere underlain by mantle at only slightly elevated temperatures(11), is not associated with basement roughness anomalies. These results highlight a fundamental difference in the nature of large- scale mantle upwellings below supercontinents and superoceans, and their impact on oceanic crustal accretion.","[Whittaker, Joanne M.; Muller, R.

It was recently recognized that the effects of temperature on ancestral organisms left 'genetic footprints' that could be uncovered in extant genomes(2-4). Accordingly, analyses of resurrected proteins predicted that the bacterial ancestor was thermophilic and that Bacteria subsequently adapted to lower temperatures(3,4). As the archaeal ancestor is also thought to have been thermophilic(5), the LUCA was parsimoniously inferred as thermophilic too. However, an analysis of ribosomal RNAs supported the hypothesis of a non- hyperthermophilic LUCA(2). Here we show that both rRNA and protein sequences analysed with advanced, realistic models of molecular evolution(6,7) provide independent support for two environmental- temperature-related phases during the evolutionary history of the tree of life. In the first period, thermotolerance increased from a mesophilic LUCA to thermophilic ancestors of Bacteria and of Archaea Eukaryota; in the second period, it decreased. Therefore, the two lineages descending from the LUCA and leading to the ancestors of Bacteria and Archaea - Eukaryota convergently adapted to high temperatures, possibly in response to a climate change of the early Earth(1,8,9), and/or aided by the transition from an RNA genome in the LUCA to organisms with more thermostable DNA genomes(10,11). This analysis unifies apparently contradictory results(2-4) into a coherent depiction of the evolution of an ecological trait over the entire tree of life.","[Boussau, Bastien; Necsulea, Anamaria; Gouy, Manolo] Univ Lyon 1, CNRS, Lab Biometrie & Biol Evolut, F-69622 Villeurbanne, France; [Blanquart, Samuel; Lartillot, Nicolas] CNRS, LIRMM, F-34392 Montpellier, France","Gouy, M (reprint author), Univ Lyon 1, CNRS, Lab Biometrie & Biol Evolut, 32 Blvd 11 Novembre, F-69622 Villeurbanne, France.",mgouy@biomserv.univ-lyon1.fr,,"Boussau, Bastien/0000-0003-0776-4460",Action Concertee Incitative IMPBIO-MODELPHYLO; ANR PlasmoExplore,"This work was supported by Action Concertee Incitative IMPBIO-MODELPHYLO and ANR PlasmoExplore.

However, little is known about the factors that influence the future performance of range- expanding species in their new habitats. Here we show that range- expanding plant species from a riverine area were better defended against shoot and root enemies than were related native plant species growing in the same area. We grew fifteen plant species with and without non- coevolved polyphagous locusts and cosmopolitan, polyphagous aphids. Contrary to our expectations, the locusts performed more poorly on the range- expanding plant species than on the congeneric native plant species, whereas the aphids showed no difference. The shoot herbivores reduced the biomass of the native plants more than they did that of the congeneric range expanders. Also, the range- expanding plants developed fewer pathogenic effects(4,5) in their root- zone soil than did the related native species. Current predictions forecast biodiversity loss due to limitations in the ability of species to adjust to climate warming conditions in their range(6-8). Our results strongly suggest that the plants that shift ranges towards higher latitudes and altitudes may include potential invaders, as the successful range expanders may experience less control by above- ground or below-ground enemies than the natives.","[Engelkes, Tim; Morrien, Elly; Verhoeven, Koen J.

In Diptera, the gene content of the X chromosome and the autosomes is well conserved: in Drosophila more than 95% of the genes have remained on the same chromosome arm in the 12 sequenced species ( 63 Myr of divergence, traversing 400 Myr of evolution) 2,4,6, and the same linkage groups are clearly recognizable in mosquito genomes (260 Myr of divergence)(3,5,7). Here we investigate the conservation of Y- linked gene content among the 12 sequenced Drosophila species. We found that only a quarter of the Drosophila melanogaster Y- linked genes ( 3 out of 12) are Y- linked in all sequenced species, and that most of them ( 7 out of 12) were acquired less than 63 Myr ago. Hence, whereas the organization of other Drosophila chromosomes traces back to the common ancestor with mosquitoes, the gene content of the D. melanogaster Y chromosome is much younger. Gene losses are known to have an important role in the evolution of Y chromosomes(8-10), and we indeed found two such cases. However, the rate of gene gain in the Drosophila Y chromosomes investigated is 10.9 times higher than the rate of gene loss ( 95% confidence interval: 2.3 - 52.5), indicating a clear tendency of the Y chromosomes to increase in gene content. In contrast with the mammalian Y chromosome, gene gains have a prominent role in the evolution of the Drosophila Y chromosome.","[Koerich, Leonardo B.; Carvalho, Antonio Bernardo] Univ Fed Rio de Janeiro, Dept Genet, BR-21944970 Rio De Janeiro, Brazil; [Wang, Xiaoyun; Clark, Andrew G.] Cornell Univ, Dept Mol Biol & Genet, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA","Carvalho, AB (reprint author), Univ Fed Rio de Janeiro, Dept Genet, Caixa Postal 68011, BR-21944970 Rio De Janeiro, Brazil.",bernardo@biologia.ufrj.br,"Koerich, Leonardo/B-8554-2008; Carvalho, A.

Direction- selective responses are particularly vulnerable to the effects of early visual deprivation, but it remains unclear how stimulus- driven neural activity guides the emergence of cortical direction selectivity. Here we report observations from a motion training protocol that allowed us to monitor the impact of experience on the development of direction- selective responses in visually naive ferrets. Using intrinsic signal imaging techniques, we found that training with a single axis of motion induced the rapid emergence of direction columns that were confined to cortical regions preferentially activated by the training stimulus. Using two- photon calcium imaging techniques, we found that single neurons in visually naive animals exhibited weak directional biases and lacked the strong local coherence in the spatial organization of direction preference that was evident in mature animals. Training with a moving stimulus, but not with a flashed stimulus, strengthened the direction- selective responses of individual neurons and preferentially reversed the direction biases of neurons that deviated from their neighbours. Both effects contributed to an increase in local coherence. We conclude that early experience with moving visual stimuli drives the rapid emergence of direction-selective responses in the visual cortex.","[Li, Ye; Van Hooser, Stephen D.; Mazurek, Mark; White, Leonard E.; Fitzpatrick, David] Duke Univ, Sch Med, Dept Neurobiol, Durham, NC 27710 USA; [White, Leonard E.] Duke Univ, Sch Med, Dept Community & Family Med, Doctor Phys Therapy Div, Durham, NC 27710 USA; [Fitzpatrick, David] Duke Univ, Duke Inst Brain Sci, Durham, NC 27710 USA","Fitzpatrick, D (reprint author), Duke Univ, Sch Med, Dept Neurobiol, Durham, NC 27710 USA.",fitzpat@neuro.duke.edu,,"Van Hooser, Stephen/0000-0002-1112-5832",Whitehall Foundation; US National Institutes of Health,"The authors thank P.

Its failure was suggested to contribute to malignant invasion(3-6). However, the molecular basis of contact inhibition of locomotion and whether it also occurs in vivo are still unknown. Here we show that neural crest cells, a highly migratory and multipotent embryonic cell population, whose behaviour has been likened to malignant invasion(6-8), demonstrate contact inhibition of locomotion both in vivo and in vitro, and that this accounts for their directional migration. When two migrating neural crest cells meet, they stop, collapse their protrusions and change direction. In contrast, when a neural crest cell meets another cell type, it fails to display contact inhibition of locomotion; instead, it invades the other tissue, in the same manner as metastatic cancer cells(3,5,9). We show that inhibition of non-canonical Wnt signalling abolishes both contact inhibition of locomotion and the directionality of neural crest migration. Wnt- signalling members localize at the site of cell contact, leading to activation of RhoA in this region. These results provide the first example of contact inhibition of locomotion in vivo, provide an explanation for coherent directional migration of groups of cells and establish a previously unknown role for noncanonical Wnt signalling.","[Carmona-Fontaine, Carlos; Matthews, Helen K.; Kuriyama, Sei; Moreno, Mauricio; Stern, Claudio D.; Mayor, Roberto] UCL, Dept Anat & Dev Biol, London WC1E 6BT, England; [Dunn, Graham A.; Parsons, Maddy] Kings Coll London, Randall Div Cell & Mol Biophys, London SE1 1UL, England","Mayor, R (reprint author), UCL, Dept Anat & Dev Biol, Mortimer St, London WC1E 6BT, England.",r.mayor@ucl.ac.uk,"Mayor, Roberto/C-6688-2008; Matthews, Helen/A-3204-2009; Zebrafish, UCL/A-3125-2009; Carmona-Fontaine, Carlos/D-1581-2009; Stern, Claudio/C-6265-2008; Ladoux, Benoit/A-9879-2013; Parsons, Maddy/B-2203-2013","Mayor, Roberto/0000-0001-9053-9613; Kuriyama, Sei/0000-0002-5502-7177; Stern, Claudio/0000-0002-9907-889X; Parsons, Maddy/0000-0002-2021-8379; Matthews, Helen/0000-0001-6660-9685",Medical Research Council; Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council; MRC; Boehringer Ingelheim Fonds,"We thank M.

Efflux carriers for the signalling molecule auxin from the PIN family(1) are landmarks of cell polarity in plants and have a crucial involvement in auxin distribution- dependent development including embryo patterning, organogenesis and tropisms(2-7). Polar PIN localization determines the direction of intercellular auxin flow(8), yet the mechanisms generating PIN polarity remain unclear. Here we identify an endocytosis- dependent mechanism of PIN polarity generation and analyse its developmental implications. Real- time PIN tracking showed that after synthesis, PINs are initially delivered to the plasma membrane in a non- polar manner and their polarity is established by subsequent endocytic recycling. Interference with PIN endocytosis either by auxin or by manipulation of the Arabidopsis Rab5 GTPase pathway prevents PIN polarization. Failure of PIN polarization transiently alters asymmetric auxin distribution during embryogenesis and increases the local auxin response in apical embryo regions. This results in ectopic expression of auxin pathway- associated root- forming master regulators in embryonic leaves and promotes homeotic transformation of leaves to roots. Our results indicate a two- step mechanism for the generation of PIN polar localization and the essential role of endocytosis in this process. It also highlights the link between endocytosis- dependent polarity of individual cells and auxin distribution- dependent cell fate establishment for multicellular patterning.","[Dhonukshe, Pankaj; Mahonen, Ari Pekka; Prasad, Kalika; Blilou, Ikram; Xu, Jian; Scheres, Ben] Univ Utrecht, Dept Biol, Fac Sci, NL-3584 CH Utrecht, Netherlands; [Tanaka, Hirokazu; Friml, Jiri] Univ Ghent VIB, Dept Plant Syst Biol, B-9052 Ghent, Belgium; [Tanaka, Hirokazu; Friml, Jiri] Univ Ghent, Dept Mol Genet, B-9052 Ghent, Belgium; [Goh, Tatsuaki; Ebine, Kazuo; Uemura, Tomohiro; Ueda, Takashi; Nakano, Akihiko] Univ Tokyo, Dept Biol Sci, Grad Sch Sci, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo 1130033, Japan; [Geldner, Niko] Univ Lausanne, Dept Plant Mol Biol DBMV, UNIL Sorge, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland; [Geldner, Niko; Chory, Joanne] Salk Inst Biol Studies, Plant Biol Lab, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; [Nakano, Akihiko] RIKEN Adv Sci Inst, Mol Membrane Biol Lab, Wako, Saitama 3510198, Japan","Dhonukshe, P (reprint author), Univ Utrecht, Dept Biol, Fac Sci, Padualaan 8, NL-3584 CH Utrecht, Netherlands.",P.B.Dhonukshe@uu.nl; jiri.friml@psb.ugent.be,"Nakano, Akihiko/C-6185-2009; Friml, Jiri/D-9511-2012; Ueda, Takashi/G-6984-2011; Xu, Jian/I-2921-2012; UEDA, TAKASHI/G-4939-2014","Xu, Jian/0000-0001-6194-6316; Nakano, Akihiko/0000-0003-3635-548X; Scheres, Ben/0000-0001-5400-9578; Mahonen, Ari Pekka/0000-0001-6051-866X","VolkswagenStiftung; EMBO Long Term Fellowship; Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO)-VENI; EMBO Young Investigator Program; Odysseus program; HFSP fellowship; NWO-VIDI; Swiss National Science Foundation; HHMI; USDA; NIH; NWO-Spinoza; Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology of Japan","We thank M.

Hh pathway activity is absolutely dependent on signalling by the seven-transmembrane protein smoothened (Smo), which is regulated by the Hh receptor patched (Ptc). Smo signals to an intracellular multi- protein complex containing the Kinesin related protein Costal2 ( Cos2), the protein kinase Fused ( Fu) and the transcription factor Cubitus interruptus (Ci)(3). In the absence of Hh, this complex regulates the cleavage of full-length Ci to a truncated repressor protein, Ci(75), in a process that is dependent on the proteasome and priming phosphorylations by Protein kinase A (PKA)(4). Binding of Hh to Ptc blocks Ptc-mediated Smo inhibition, allowing Smo to signal to the intracellular components to attenuate Ci cleavage. Because of its homology with the Frizzled family of G-protein-coupled receptors ( GPCR) 5, a likely candidate for an immediate Smo effector would be a heterotrimeric G protein. However, the role that G proteins may have in Hh signal transduction is unclear and quite controversial(6-10), which has led to widespread speculation that Smo signals through a variety of novel G-protein-independent mechanisms. Here we present in vitro and in vivo evidence in Drosophila that Smo activates a G protein to modulate intracellular cyclic AMP levels in response to Hh. Our results demonstrate that Smo functions as a canonical GPCR, which signals through G alpha(i) to regulate Hh pathway activation.","[Ogden, Stacey K.; Fei, Dennis Liang; Schilling, Neal S.; Hwa, John; Robbins, David J.] Dartmouth Med Sch, Dept Pharmacol & Toxicol, Hanover, NH 03755 USA; [Ahmed, Yashi F.] Dartmouth Med Sch, Dept Genet, Hanover, NH 03755 USA; [Hwa, John] Dartmouth Med Sch, Dept Med Cardiol, Hanover, NH 03755 USA; [Ahmed, Yashi F.; Robbins, David J.] Dartmouth Med Sch, Norris Cotton Canc Ctr, Lebanon, NH 03756 USA","Robbins, DJ (reprint author), Dartmouth Med Sch, Dept Pharmacol & Toxicol, Hanover, NH 03755 USA.",david.j.robbins@dartmouth.edu,,"Fei, Dennis Liang/0000-0002-1953-0584","National Institutes of Health [CA82628, HL074190]","This work was supported by National Institutes of Health grants CA82628 (D.J.R.) and HL074190 (J.H.).

Whether and how increasing the cellular protein synthesis capacity affects the multistep process leading to cancer remains to be addressed. Here we use ribosomal protein heterozygote mice as a genetic tool to restore increased protein synthesis in E mu-Myc/+ transgenic mice to normal levels, and show that the oncogenic potential of Myc in this context is suppressed. Our findings demonstrate that the ability of Myc to increase protein synthesis directly augments cell size and is sufficient to accelerate cell cycle progression independently of known cell cycle targets transcriptionally regulated by Myc. In addition, when protein synthesis is restored to normal levels, Myc- overexpressing precancerous cells are more efficiently eliminated by programmed cell death. Our findings reveal a new mechanism that links increases in general protein synthesis rates downstream of an oncogenic signal to a specific molecular impairment in the modality of translation initiation used to regulate the expression of selective messenger RNAs. We show that an aberrant increase in cap- dependent translation downstream of Myc hyperactivation specifically impairs the translational switch to internal ribosomal entry site ( IRES)- dependent translation that is required for accurate mitotic progression. Failure of this translational switch results in reduced mitotic- specific expression of the endogenous IRES- dependent form of Cdk11 ( also known as Cdc21 and PITSLRE)(3-5), which leads to cytokinesis defects and is associated with increased centrosome numbers and genome instability in E mu-Myc/+ mice. When accurate translational control is re- established in E mu-Myc/+ mice, genome instability is suppressed. Our findings demonstrate how perturbations in translational control provide a highly specific outcome for gene expression, genome stability and cancer initiation that have important implications for understanding the molecular mechanism of cancer formation at the post- genomic level.","[Barna, Maria; Kondrashov, Nadya] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Biochem & Biophys, San Francisco, CA 94158 USA; [Pusic, Aya; Zollo, Ornella; Costa, Maria; Ruggero, Davide] Univ Calif San Francisco, Helen Diller Family Comprehens Canc Ctr, Sch Med, San Francisco, CA 94158 USA; [Pusic, Aya; Zollo, Ornella; Costa, Maria; Ruggero, Davide] Univ Calif San Francisco, Helen Diller Family Comprehens Canc Ctr, Dept Urol, San Francisco, CA 94158 USA; [Rego, Eduardo] Univ Sao Paulo, Ctr Cell Based Therapy, Fdn Hemoctr Ribeirao Preto, BR-14048900 Sao Paulo, Brazil; [Rao, Pulivarthi H.] Baylor Coll Med, Dept Pediat, Houston, TX 77030 USA","Barna, M (reprint author), Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Biochem & Biophys, Rock Hall Room 384C,1550 4th St, San Francisco, CA 94158 USA.",maria.barna@ucsf.edu; Davide.Ruggero@ucsf.edu,"Costa, Maria Jose/I-7754-2013; Rego, Eduardo/A-1058-2012; CEPID, CTC USP/J-5104-2015","Costa, Maria Jose/0000-0001-6111-7614; Rego, Eduardo/0000-0003-1567-4086; ",NIH; Sandler Foundation,"We thank F.

For clathrin-coated vesicles, the motifs are recognized by clathrin adaptors.

Here we describe the binding of AP2 to the endocytic dileucine motif from CD4 ( ref. 2). The major recognition events are the two leucine residues binding in hydrophobic pockets on sigma 2. The hydrophilic residue four residues upstream from the first leucine sits on a positively charged patch made from residues on the sigma 2 and a subunits. Mutations in key residues inhibit the binding of AP2 to 'acidic dileucine' motifs displayed in liposomes containing phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate,but do not affect binding to Yxx Phi motifs through mu 2. In the 'inactive' AP2 core structure(3) both motif- binding sites are blocked by different parts of the beta 2 subunit. To allow a dileucine motif to bind, the beta 2 amino terminus is displaced and becomes disordered; however, in this structure the Yxx Phi-binding site on mu 2 remains blocked.","[Kelly, Bernard T.; McCoy, Airlie J.; Miller, Sharon E.; Owen, David J.] Univ Cambridge, Addenbrookes Hosp, Cambridge Inst Med Res, Cambridge CB2 0XY, England; [Kelly, Bernard T.; McCoy, Airlie J.; Miller, Sharon E.; Owen, David J.] Univ Cambridge, Addenbrookes Hosp, Dept Clin Biochem, Cambridge CB2 0XY, England; [Spaete, Kira; Hoening, Stefan] Univ Cologne, Inst Biochem 1, D-50931 Cologne, Germany; [Spaete, Kira; Hoening, Stefan] Univ Cologne, Ctr Mol Med Cologne, D-50931 Cologne, Germany; [Evans, Philip R.] MRC, Mol Biol Lab, Cambridge CB2 0QH, England","Owen, DJ (reprint author), Univ Cambridge, Addenbrookes Hosp, Cambridge Inst Med Res, Hills Rd, Cambridge CB2 0XY, England.",djo30@cam.ac.uk,,,"Wellcome Trust Senior Research Fellowship; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft [SFB635, SFB670]","We thank the protein crystallography beamline staff at Diamond, especially E.

Dysregulation of microRNAs by several mechanisms has been described in various disease states(3-5) including cardiac disease(6-10). Whereas previous studies of cardiac disease have focused on microRNAs that are primarily expressed in cardiomyocytes, the role of microRNAs expressed in other cell types of the heart is unclear. Here we show that microRNA-21 (miR-21, also known as Mirn21) regulates the ERK - MAP kinase signalling pathway in cardiac fibroblasts, which has impacts on global cardiac structure and function. miR-21 levels are increased selectively in fibroblasts of the failing heart, augmenting ERK - MAP kinase activity through inhibition of sprouty homologue 1 ( Spry1). This mechanism regulates fibroblast survival and growth factor secretion, apparently controlling the extent of interstitial fibrosis and cardiac hypertrophy. In vivo silencing of miR- 21 by a specific antagomir in a mouse pressure- overload- induced disease model reduces cardiac ERK - MAP kinase activity, inhibits interstitial fibrosis and attenuates cardiac dysfunction. These findings reveal that microRNAs can contribute to myocardial disease by an effect in cardiac fibroblasts. Our results validate miR- 21 as a disease target in heart failure and establish the therapeutic efficacy of microRNA therapeutic intervention in a cardiovascular disease setting.","[Thum, Thomas; Fiedler, Jan; Galuppo, Paolo; Frantz, Stefan; Bauersachs, Johann] Univ Wurzburg, Dept Med 1, D-97080 Wurzburg, Germany; [Thum, Thomas; Fiedler, Jan] Univ Wurzburg, Jr Res Grp, IZKF, D-97080 Wurzburg, Germany; [Gross, Carina; Fischer, Thomas; Kissler, Stephan; Engelhardt, Stefan] Univ Wurzburg, Rudolf Virchow Ctr, DFG, Res Ctr Expt Biomed, D-97080 Wurzburg, Germany; [Rosenwald, Andreas] Univ Wurzburg, Inst Pathol, D-97080 Wurzburg, Germany; [Bussen, Markus] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Anat, San Francisco, CA 94158 USA; [Just, Steffen; Rottbauer, Wolfgang] Univ Heidelberg, Dept Internal Med 3, D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany; [Castoldi, Mirco; Muckenthaler, Martina U.] Univ Heidelberg, Dept Pediat Hematol Oncol & Immunol, D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany; [Castoldi, Mirco; Muckenthaler, Martina U.] Univ Heidelberg, Mol Med Partnership Unit, D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany; [Soutschek, Jurgen] Regulus Therapeut, Carlsbad, CA 92008 USA; [Koteliansky, Victor] Alnylam Pharmaceut, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; [Basson, M.

Several studies have underlined the importance of non-structural protein NS1 in the increased pathogenicity and virulence of these strains(3,4). NS1, which consists of two domains a double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) binding domain(5,6) and the effector domain(7), separated through a linker - is an antagonist of antiviral type-I interferon response in the host(8,9). Here we report the X-ray structure of the full- length NS1 from an H5N1 strain (A/Vietnam/1203/2004) that was associated with 60% of human deaths in an outbreak in Vietnam(1,2). Compared to the individually determined structures of the RNA binding domain and the effector domain from non- H5N1 strains, the RNA binding domain within H5N1 NS1 exhibits modest structural changes, while the H5N1 effector domain shows significant alteration, particularly in the dimeric interface. Although both domains in the full- length NS1 individually participate in dimeric interactions, an unexpected finding is that these interactions result in the formation of a chain of NS1 molecules instead of distinct dimeric units. Three such chains in the crystal interact with one another extensively to form a tubular organization of similar dimensions to that observed in the cryo- electron microscopy images of NS1 in the presence of dsRNA. The tubular oligomeric organization of NS1, in which residues implicated in dsRNA binding face a 20-angstrom-wide central tunnel, provides a plausible mechanism for how NS1 sequesters varying lengths of dsRNA, to counter cellular antiviral dsRNA response pathways, while simultaneously interacting with other cellular ligands during an infection.","[Bornholdt, Zachary A.; Prasad, B.

The classical pentraxins include serum amyloid P component ( SAP) and C- reactive protein, which are two of the acute- phase proteins synthesized in response to infection(1,2). Both recognize microbial pathogens and activate the classical complement pathway through C1q ( refs 3 and 4). More recently, members of the pentraxin family were found to interact with cell- surface Fc gamma receptors (Fc gamma R) and activate leukocyte-mediated phagocytosis(5-8). Here we describe the structural mechanism for pentraxin's binding to Fc gamma R and its functional activation of Fc gamma R- mediated phagocytosis and cytokine secretion. The complex structure between human SAP and Fc gamma RIIa reveals a diagonally bound receptor on each SAP pentamer with both D1 and D2 domains of the receptor contacting the ridge helices from two SAP subunits. The 1: 1 stoichiometry between SAP and Fc gamma RIIa infers the requirement for multivalent pathogen binding for receptor aggregation. Mutational and binding studies show that pentraxins are diverse in their binding specificity for Fc gamma R isoforms but conserved in their recognition structure. The shared binding site for SAP and IgG results in competition for Fc gamma R binding and the inhibition of immune- complex- mediated phagocytosis by soluble pentraxins. These results establish antibody- like functions for pentraxins in the Fc gamma R pathway, suggest an evolutionary overlap between the innate and adaptive immune systems, and have new therapeutic implications for autoimmune diseases.","[Lu, Jinghua; Sun, Peter D.] NIAID, Struct Immunol Sect, Immunogenet Lab, NIH, Rockville, MD 20852 USA; [Marnell, Lorraine L.; Marjon, Kristopher D.; Mold, Carolyn; Du Clos, Terry W.] Univ New Mexico, Dept Internal Med, Albuquerque, NM 87131 USA; [Marnell, Lorraine L.; Marjon, Kristopher D.; Mold, Carolyn; Du Clos, Terry W.] Univ New Mexico, Dept Mol Genet & Microbiol, Albuquerque, NM 87131 USA; [Du Clos, Terry W.] Vet Adm Med Ctr, Albuquerque, NM 87108 USA","Sun, PD (reprint author), NIAID, Struct Immunol Sect, Immunogenet Lab, NIH, Rockville, MD 20852 USA.",psun@nih.gov,"lu, jinghua/G-5872-2012",,US Department of Energy; Basic Energy Sciences; Office of Science [W-31-109-Eng-83]; National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases; National Institutes of Health; Department of Veterans Affairs;  [RO1 AI28358],"We thank D.

This large macromolecular assembly has been described as a 3 '-> 5 ' exonuclease(1) and shown to contain a nine- subunit ring structure evolutionarily related to archaeal exosome- like complexes and bacterial polynucleotide phosphorylases. Recent results have shown that, unlike its prokaryotic counterparts, the yeast and human ring structures are catalytically inactive. In contrast, the exonucleolytic activity of the yeast exosome core was shown to be mediated by the RNB domain of the eukaryote- specific Dis3 subunit(7-9). Here we show, using in vitro assays, that yeast Dis3 has an additional endoribonuclease activity mediated by the PIN domain located at the amino terminus of this multidomain protein. Simultaneous inactivation of the endonucleolytic and exonucleolytic activities of the exosome core generates a synthetic growth phenotype in vivo, supporting a physiological function for the PIN domain. This activity is responsible for the cleavage of some natural exosome substrates, independently of exonucleolytic degradation. In contrast with current models, our results show that eukaryotic exosome cores have both endonucleolytic and exonucleolytic activities, mediated by two distinct domains of the Dis3 subunit. The mode of action of eukaryotic exosome cores in RNA processing and degradation should be reconsidered, taking into account the cooperation between its multiple ribonucleolytic activities.","[Tomecki, Rafal; Dziembowski, Andrzej] Warsaw Univ, Dept Genet & Biotechnol, Fac Biol, PL-02106 Warsaw, Poland; [Tomecki, Rafal; Dziembowski, Andrzej] Polish Acad Sci, Inst Biochem & Biophys, PL-02106 Warsaw, Poland; [Lebreton, Alice; Seraphin, Bertrand] CNRS, Ctr Genet Mol, UPR 2167, F-91198 Gif Sur Yvette, France; [Lebreton, Alice; Seraphin, Bertrand] Univ Paris 11, F-91405 Orsay, France; [Lebreton, Alice; Seraphin, Bertrand] Univ Paris 06, F-75005 Paris, France","Dziembowski, A (reprint author), Warsaw Univ, Dept Genet & Biotechnol, Fac Biol, PL-02106 Warsaw, Poland.",andrzejd@ibb.waw.pl; seraphin@cgm.cnrs-gif.fr,"Lebreton, Alice/M-8764-2015","Lebreton, Alice/0000-0002-6643-902X; Tomecki, Rafal/0000-0003-2473-5004; Tomecki, Rafal/0000-0003-2880-0555; Dziembowski, Andrzej/0000-0001-8492-7572; Seraphin, Bertrand/0000-0002-5168-1921","La Ligue contre le Cancer (Equipe Labellisee 2008); Agence Nationale de la Recherche project CUTs; CNRS; ESF RNA Quality program (project EUxosome); FP6 EU; Foundation for Polish Science; Faculty of Biology, University of Warsaw","We thank E.

Furthermore, recent studies demonstrate a critical relationship between circadian and metabolic physiology(4-7). The nuclear receptor corepressor 1 (Ncor1) functions as an activating subunit for the chromatin modifying enzyme histone deacetylase 3 (Hdac3)(8). Lack of Ncor1 is incompatible with life, and hence it is unknown whether Ncor1, and particularly its regulation of Hdac3, is critical for adult mammalian physiology(9). Here we show that specific, genetic disruption of the Ncor1-Hdac3 interaction in mice causes aberrant regulation of clock genes and results in abnormal circadian behaviour. These mice are also leaner and more insulin- sensitive owing to increased energy expenditure. Unexpectedly, loss of a functional Ncor1-Hdac3 complex in vivo does not lead to sustained increases in known catabolic genes, but instead significantly alters the oscillatory patterns of several metabolic genes, demonstrating that circadian regulation of metabolism is critical for normal energy balance. These findings indicate that activation of Hdac3 by Ncor1 is a nodal point in the epigenetic regulation of circadian and metabolic physiology.","[Alenghat, Theresa; Meyers, Katherine; Mullican, Shannon E.; Leitner, Kirstin; Avila, Jacqueline; Ahima, Rexford S.; Lazar, Mitchell A.] Univ Penn, Sch Med, Div Endocrinol Diabet & Metab, Dept Med, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Alenghat, Theresa; Meyers, Katherine; Mullican, Shannon E.; Leitner, Kirstin; Avila, Jacqueline; Ahima, Rexford S.; Kaestner, Klaus H.; Lazar, Mitchell A.] Univ Penn, Sch Med, Inst Diabet Obes & Metab, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Adeniji-Adele, Adetoun; Bucan, Maja; Kaestner, Klaus H.] Univ Penn, Sch Med, Dept Genet, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA","Lazar, MA (reprint author), Univ Penn, Sch Med, Div Endocrinol Diabet & Metab, Dept Med, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",lazar@mail.med.upenn.edu,,,National Institutes of Health [DK43806]; National Research Training Grant in Developmental Biology,"We thank W.

Although it is now widely regarded that enzymes modulate reaction rates by means of short- and long- range protein motions(3-7), it is almost impossible to distinguish between conformational changes and catalysis. We have solved this problem using the chlorophyll biosynthetic enzyme NADPH: protochlorophyllide ( Pchlide) oxidoreductase, which catalyses a unique light- driven reaction involving hydride and proton transfers(8). Here we report that prior excitation of the enzyme- substrate complex with a laser pulse induces a more favourable conformation of the active site, enabling the coupled hydride and proton transfer reactions to occur. This effect, which is triggered during the Pchlide excited-state lifetime and persists on a long timescale, switches the enzyme into an active state characterized by a high rate and quantum yield of formation of a catalytic intermediate. The corresponding spectral changes in the mid- infrared following the absorption of one photon reveal significant conformational changes in the enzyme, illustrating the importance of flexibility and dynamics in the structure of enzymes for their function.","[Hunter, C.

However, the mechanism for how these opposite astrocyte influences provide appropriate changes in vessel tone within an environment that has dynamic metabolic requirements remains unclear. Here we show that the ability of astrocytes to induce vasodilations over vasoconstrictions relies on the metabolic state of the rat brain tissue. When oxygen availability is lowered and astrocyte calcium concentration is elevated, astrocyte glycolysis and lactate release are maximized. External lactate attenuates transporter- mediated uptake from the extracellular space of prostaglandin E(2), leading to accumulation and subsequent vasodilation. In conditions of low oxygen concentration extracellular adenosine also increases, which blocks astrocyte- mediated constriction, facilitating dilation. These data reveal the role of metabolic substrates in regulating brain blood flow and provide a mechanism for differential astrocyte control over cerebrovascular diameter during different states of brain activation.","[Gordon, Grant R.

To evade the host's immune response, Giardia undergoes antigenic variation - a process that allows the parasite to develop chronic and recurrent infections. From a repertoire of similar to 190 variant- specific surface protein ( VSP)- coding genes, Giardia expresses only one VSP on the surface of each parasite at a particular time, but spontaneously switches to a different VSP by unknown mechanisms. Here we show that regulation of VSP expression involves a system comprising RNA- dependent RNA polymerase, Dicer and Argonaute, known components of the RNA interference machinery. Clones expressing a single surface antigen efficiently transcribe several VSP genes but only accumulate transcripts encoding the VSP to be expressed. Detection of antisense RNAs corresponding to the silenced VSP genes and small RNAs from the silenced but not for the expressed vsp implicate the RNA interference pathway in antigenic variation. Remarkably, silencing of Dicer and RNA- dependent RNA polymerase leads to a change from single to multiple VSP expression in individual parasites.","[Prucca, Cesar G.; Slavin, Ileana; Quiroga, Rodrigo; Elias, Eliana V.; Rivero, Fernando D.; Saura, Alicia; Carranza, Pedro G.; Lujan, Hugo D.] Univ Catolica Cordoba, Fac Med, Lab Bioquim & Biol Mol, Cordoba, Argentina","Lujan, HD (reprint author), Univ Catolica Cordoba, Fac Med, Lab Bioquim & Biol Mol, X5004ASK, Cordoba, Argentina.",hlujan@ucc.edu.ar,,"Quiroga, Rodrigo/0000-0001-5015-0531",Agencia Nacional para la Promocion de la Ciencia y la Tecnologia; Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas; Universidad Catolica de Cordoba; Howard Hughes Medical Institute; European Union CONTENT,"We thank N.

The ability of cells to respond distinguishably to different pheromone concentrations depends on how much information about pheromone concentration the system can transmit. Here we show that the mitogen- activated protein kinase Fus3 mediates fast- acting negative feedback that adjusts the dose response of the downstream system response to match the dose response of receptor- ligand binding. This ` dose - response alignment', defined by a linear relationship between receptor occupancy and downstream response, can improve the fidelity of information transmission by making downstream responses corresponding to different receptor occupancies more distinguishable and reducing amplification of stochastic noise during signal transmission. We also show that one target of the feedback is a previously uncharacterized signal- promoting function of the regulator of G- protein signalling protein Sst2. Our work suggests that negative feedback is a general mechanism used in signalling systems to align dose responses and thereby increase the fidelity of information transmission.","[Yu, Richard C.; Pesce, C.

For example, head- on collision of the replisome with RNA polymerase results in replication fork arrest. However, co- directional collision of the replisome with RNA polymerase has little or no effect on fork progression. Here we examine co- directional collisions between a replisome and RNA polymerase in vitro. We show that the Escherichia coli replisome uses the RNAtranscript as a primer to continue leading- strand synthesis after the collision with RNA polymerase that is displaced from the DNA. This action results in a discontinuity in the leading strand, yet the replisome remains intact and bound to DNA during the entire process. These findings underscore the notable plasticity by which the replisome operates to circumvent obstacles in its path and may explain why the leading strand is synthesized discontinuously in vivo.","[Pomerantz, Richard T.; O'Donnell, Mike] Rockefeller Univ, Howard Hughes Med Inst, New York, NY 10021 USA","O'Donnell, M (reprint author), Rockefeller Univ, Howard Hughes Med Inst, 1230 York Ave, New York, NY 10021 USA.",odonnell@mail.rockefeller.edu,,"O'Donnell, Michael/0000-0001-9002-4214",National Institutes of Health; Marie-Josee and Henry Kravis Fellowship at the Rockefeller University,"We are grateful to W.

Yet models of such 'hot- Jupiter' planets predict an abundance of atmospheric water vapour(2). Validating and constraining these models is crucial to understanding the physics and chemistry of planetary atmospheres in extreme environments. Indications of the presence of water in the atmosphere of HD189733b have recently been found in transmission spectra(3,4), where the planet's atmosphere selectively absorbs the light of the parent star, and in broadband photometry(5). Here we report the detection of strong water absorption in a high- signal- to- noise, mid- infrared emission spectrumof the planet itself. We find both a strong downturn in the flux ratio below 10 mu m and discrete spectral features that are characteristic of strong absorption by water vapour. The differences between these and previous observations are significant and admit the possibility that predicted planetary- scale dynamical weather structures(6) may alter the emission spectrum over time. Models that match the observed spectrum and the broadband photometry suggest that heat redistribution from the dayside to the nightside is weak. Reconciling this with the high nightside temperature(7) will require a better understanding of atmospheric circulation or possible additional energy sources.","[Grillmair, Carl J.; Armus, Lee; Stauffer, John; Levine, Deborah] Spitzer Sci Ctr, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA; [Burrows, Adam] Princeton Univ, Dept Astrophys Sci, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Charbonneau, David] Harvard Smithsonian Ctr Astrophys, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Meadows, Victoria] Univ Washington, Dept Astron, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [van Cleve, Jeffrey] Ball Aerosp & Technol Corp, Boulder, CO 80306 USA; [von Braun, Kaspar] CALTECH, Michelson Sci Ctr, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA","Grillmair, CJ (reprint author), Spitzer Sci Ctr, 1200 E Calif Blvd, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA.",carl@ipac.caltech.edu,,"Armus, Lee/0000-0003-3498-2973; Charbonneau, David/0000-0002-9003-484X",NASA [NNGO4GL22G]; JPL/Caltech,"This work is based on observations made with the Spitzer Space Telescope, which is operated by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), California Institute of Technology (Caltech), under a contract with NASA.

But given the extremely cold surface temperatures and meagre radiogenic heat sources of these moons, it is still unclear how these oceans remain liquid. The prevailing conjecture is that these oceans are heated by tidal forces that flex the solid moon ( rock plus ice) during its eccentric orbit, and that this heat entering the ocean does not rapidly escape because of the insulating layer of ice over the ocean surface. Here, however, I describe strong tidal dissipation ( and heating) in the liquid oceans; I show that a subdominant and previously unconsidered tidal force due to obliquity ( axial tilt of the moon with respect to its orbital plane) has the right form and frequency to resonantly excite large- amplitude Rossby waves in these oceans. In the specific case of Europa, the minimumkinetic energy of the flow associated with this resonance ( 7.3x10(18) J) is two thousand times larger than that of the flow excited by the dominant tidal forces, and dissipation of this energy seems large enough to be a primary ocean heat source.","[Tyler, Robert H.] Univ Washington, Appl Phys Lab, Seattle, WA 98105 USA; [Tyler, Robert H.] Univ Washington, Dept Earth & Space Sci, Seattle, WA 98105 USA","Tyler, RH (reprint author), Univ Washington, Appl Phys Lab, 1013 NE 40th St, Seattle, WA 98105 USA.",tyler@apl.washington.edu,,,NASA Outer Planets Research,K.

In particular, it is an essential requirement for the implementation of quantum networks and quantum repeaters(1-3). So far, quantum interfaces between light and atoms have been demonstrated with atomic gases(4-9), and with single trapped atoms in cavities(10). Here we demonstrate the coherent and reversible mapping of a light field with less than one photon per pulse onto an ensemble of similar to 10(7) atoms naturally trapped in a solid. This is achieved by coherently absorbing the light field in a suitably prepared solid- state atomic medium(11). The state of the light is mapped onto collective atomic excitations at an optical transition and stored for a pre- determined time of up to 1 mu s before being released in a well- defined spatio- temporal mode as a result of a collective interference. The coherence of the process is verified by performing an interference experiment with two stored weak pulses with a variable phase relation. Visibilities of more than 95 per cent are obtained, demonstrating the high coherence of the mapping process at the single- photon level. In addition, we show experimentally that our interface makes it possible to store and retrieve light fields in multiple temporal modes. Our results open the way to multimode solid- state quantum memories as a promising alternative to atomic gases.","[de Riedmatten, Hugues; Afzelius, Mikael; Staudt, Matthias U.; Simon, Christoph; Gisin, Nicolas] Univ Geneva, Appl Phys Grp, CH-1211 Geneva 4, Switzerland","de Riedmatten, H (reprint author), Univ Geneva, Appl Phys Grp, CH-1211 Geneva 4, Switzerland.",hugues.deriedmatten@unige.ch,"Simon, Christoph/F-8163-2010; Afzelius, Mikael/N-5825-2016; de Riedmatten, Hugues/P-7563-2017","Simon, Christoph/0000-0003-0747-8800; Afzelius, Mikael/0000-0001-8367-6820; de Riedmatten, Hugues/0000-0002-4418-0723",Swiss NCCR Quantum Photonics; European Commission,We thank E.

It is thus critically important that during a chemical synthesis of chiral molecules only one of the two three- dimensional arrangements is created. Although certain classes of chiral molecules ( for example secondary alcohols(3,4)) are now easy to make selectively in the single mirror image form, one class - those containing quaternary stereogenic centres ( a carbon atom with four different non- hydrogen substituents) - remains a great challenge(5-8). Here we present a general solution to this problem which takes easily obtainable secondary alcohols in their single mirror image form and in a two- step sequence converts them into tertiary alcohols ( quaternary stereogenic centres). The overall process involves removing the hydrogen atom ( attached to carbon) of the secondary alcohol and effectively replacing it with an alkyl, alkenyl or aryl group. Furthermore, starting from a single mirror image form of the secondary alcohol, either mirror image form of the tertiary alcohol can be made with high levels of stereo control. Thus, a broad range of tertiary alcohols can now be easily made by this method with very high levels of selectivity. We expect that this methodology could find widespread application, as the intermediate tertiary boronic esters can potentially be converted into a range of functional groups with retention of configuration.","[Stymiest, Jake L.; Bagutski, Viktor; French, Rosalind M.; Aggarwal, Varinder K.] Univ Bristol, Sch Chem, Bristol BS8 1TS, Avon, England","Aggarwal, VK (reprint author), Univ Bristol, Sch Chem, Cantocks Close, Bristol BS8 1TS, Avon, England.",v.aggarwal@bristol.ac.uk,"Bagutski, Viktor/A-3207-2013","Bagutski, Viktor/0000-0002-7514-2455",EPSRC; Merck; Royal Society for a Wolfson Research Merit Award; Senior Research Fellowship,We thank EPSRC for financial support and Frontier Scientific for their donation of boronic esters.

In highly evolved rifts, tensile stresses from far-field plate motions accumulate over decades before being released during relatively short time intervals by faulting and magmatic intrusions(1-3). These rifting crises are rarely observed in thick lithosphere during the initial stages of rifting. Here we show that most of the strain during the July - August 2007 seismic crisis in the weakly extended Natron rift, Tanzania, was released aseismically. Deformation was achieved by slow slip on a normal fault that promoted subsequent dyke intrusion by stress unclamping. This event provides compelling evidence for strain accommodation by magma intrusion, in addition to slip along normal faults, during the initial stages of continental rifting and before significant crustal thinning.","[Calais, Eric; Stamps, D.

Apart from Bacteria belonging to the beta- and gamma-Proteobacteria involved in the first nitrification step, Crenarchaeota have recently been recognized as main drivers of the oxidation of ammonia to nitrite in soil as well as in the ocean, as indicated by the dominance of archaeal ammonia monooxygenase (amoA) genes over bacterial amoA(2,3). Evidence is accumulating that archaeal amoA genes are common in a wide range of marine systems(3-6). Essentially, all these reports focused on surface and mesopelagic (200-1,000 m depth) waters, where ammonia concentrations are higher than in waters below 1,000 m depth. However, Crenarchaeota are also abundant in the water column below 1,000 m, where ammonia concentrations are extremely low. Here we show that, throughout the NorthAtlantic Ocean, the abundance of archaeal amoA genes decreases markedly from subsurface waters to 4,000 m depth, and from subpolar to equatorial deep waters, leading to pronounced vertical and latitudinal gradients in the ratio of archaeal amoA to crenarchaeal 16S ribosomal RNA ( rRNA) genes. The lack of significant copy numbers of amoA genes and the very low fixation rates of dark carbon dioxide in the bathypelagic North Atlantic suggest that most bathypelagic Crenarchaeota are not autotrophic ammonia oxidizers: most likely, they utilize organic matter and hence live heterotrophically.","[Agogue, Helene; Brink, Maaike; Dinasquet, Julie; Herndl, Gerhard J.] Royal Netherlands Inst Sea Res, Dept Biol Oceanog, NL-1790 AB Den Burg, Texel, Netherlands","Herndl, GJ (reprint author), Univ Vienna, Vienna Ecol Ctr, Dept Marine Biol, Waehringer Guertel 18, A-1090 Vienna, Austria.",herndl@nioz.nl,"Herndl, Gerhard/B-1513-2013; Agogue, Helene/O-4122-2014","Herndl, Gerhard/0000-0002-2223-2852; Agogue, Helene/0000-0002-1078-0130",Marie Curie Fellowship of the European Community; Earth and Life Science Division of the Dutch Science Foundation (ALW-NWO) (TRANSAT and ARCHIMEDES projects); 6th Framework Program of the European Union,"We thank the captain and crew of the RV Pelagia for their help during work at sea.

Researchers in many disciplines have used large systems of coupled oscillators to model the behaviour of a diverse array of fluctuating systems in nature(1-4). In the well- studied regime of weak coupling, synchronization is favoured by increases in coupling strength and large- scale network structures ( for example 'small worlds') that produce short cuts and clustering(5-9). Here we show that, by contrast, randomizing the structure of dispersal networks in a model of predators and prey tends to favour asynchrony and prolonged transient dynamics, with resulting effects on the amplitudes of population fluctuations. Our results focus on synchronization and dynamics of clusters in models, and on time-scales, more appropriate for ecology, namely smaller systems with strong interactions outside the weak- coupling regime, rather than the better- studied cases of large, weakly coupled systems.

The targeting of the Drosophila R7 and R8 photoreceptor axons to different synaptic layers in the brain provides a model with which to explore the genetic programs regulating target specificity. In principle this can be accomplished by cell- type- specific molecules mediating the recognition between synaptic partners(1). Alternatively, specificity could also be achieved through cell- type- specific repression of particular targeting molecules. Here we show that a key step in the targeting of the R7 neuron is the active repression of the R8 targeting program. Repression is dependent on NF-YC, a subunit of the NF-Y ( nuclear factor Y) transcription factor(2). In the absence of NF-YC, R7 axons terminate in the same layer as R8 axons. Genetic experiments indicate that this is due solely to the derepression of the R8specific transcription factor Senseless(3) ( Sens) late in R7 differentiation. Sens is sufficient to control R8 targeting specificity and we demonstrate that Sens directly binds to an evolutionarily conserved DNA sequence upstream of the start of transcription of an R8- specific cell- surface protein, Capricious ( Caps) that regulates R8 target specificity. We show that R7 targeting requires the R7- specific transcription factor Prospero(4,5) ( Pros) in parallel to repression of the R8 targeting pathway by NF-YC. Previous studies demonstrated that Sens(6,7) and Pros(8) directly regulate the expression of specific rhodopsins in R8 and R7. We propose that the use of the same transcription factors to promote the cell- type- specific expression of sensory receptors and cell- surface proteins regulating synaptic target specificity provides a simple and general mechanism for ensuring that transmission of sensory information is processed by the appropriate specialized neural circuits.","[Morey, Marta; Yee, Susan K.; Herman, Tory; Nern, Aljoscha; Zipursky, S.

Layer- specific recognition molecules that allow projecting neurons to stabilize transient contacts and initiate synaptogenesis(2,3) have been identified. However, most of the neuronal cell- surface molecules critical for layer organization are expressed broadly in the developing nervous system(4,5), raising the question of how these so- called permissive adhesion molecules support synaptic specificity. Here we show that the temporal expression dynamics of the zinc- finger protein sequoia is the major determinant of Drosophila photoreceptor connectivity into distinct synaptic layers. Neighbouring R8 and R7 photoreceptors show consecutive peaks of elevated sequoia expression, which correspond to their sequential target- layer innervation. Loss of sequoia in R7 leads to a projection switch into the R8 recipient layer, whereas a prolonged expression in R8 induces a redirection of their axons into the R7 layer. The sequoia- induced axon targeting is mediated through the ubiquitously expressed Cadherin- N cell adhesion molecule. Our data support a model in which recognition specificity during synaptic layer formation is generated through a temporally restricted axonal competence to respond to broadly expressed adhesion molecules. Because developing neurons innervating the same target area often project in a distinct, birth- order- dependent sequence, temporal identity seems to contain crucial information in generating not only cell type diversity during neuronal division(6) but also connection diversity of projecting neurons.","[Petrovic, Milan; Hummel, Thomas] Univ Munster, Inst Neurobiol, D-48149 Munster, Germany","Hummel, T (reprint author), Univ Munster, Inst Neurobiol, Badestr 9, D-48149 Munster, Germany.",hummel@uni-muenster.de,,,Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft [SFB629]; EMBO Young Investigator Programme,"We thank H.

Given the critical role of PSCs in maintaining prostate tissue integrity and their potential involvement in prostate tumorigenesis(2), it is important to define specific markers for normal PSCs. Several cell- surface markers have been reported to identify candidate PSCs, including stem cell antigen-1 ( Sca-1, also known as Ly6a), CD133 (Prom1) and CD44 ( refs 3-10). However, many non- PSCs in the mouse prostate also express these markers and thus identification of a more defined PSC population remains elusive. Here we identify CD117 ( c- kit, stem cell factor receptor) as a new marker of a rare adult mouse PSC population, and demonstrate that a single stem cell defined by the phenotype Lin(-) Sca-1(+)CD133(+)CD44(+)CD117(+) can generate a prostate after transplantation in vivo. CD117 expression is predominantly localized to the region of the mouse prostate proximal to the urethra and is upregulated after castration- induced prostate involution - two characteristics consistent with that of a PSC marker. CD117(+) PSCs can generate functional, secretion- producing prostates when transplanted in vivo. Moreover, CD117(+) PSCs have long- term self-renewal capacity, as evidenced by serial isolation and transplantation in vivo. Our data establish that single cells in the adult mouse prostate with multipotent, self- renewal capacity are defined by a Lin(-)Sca-1(+) CD133(+) CD44(+) CD117(+) phenotype.","[Leong, Kevin G.; Wang, Bu-Er; Johnson, Leisa; Gao, Wei-Qiang] Genentech Inc, Dept Mol Biol, San Francisco, CA 94080 USA","Gao, WQ (reprint author), Genentech Inc, Dept Mol Biol, 1 DNA Way, San Francisco, CA 94080 USA.",gao@gene.com,,,Genentech Laboratory Animal Resources,"We thank J.

These processes are coordinated by vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF) and platelet- derived growth factor ( PDGF) through their cognate receptors on endothelial cells and vascular smooth muscle cells ( VSMCs), respectively(3,4). PDGF induces neovascularization by priming VSMCs/pericytes to release proangiogenic mediators(5-7). Although VEGF directly stimulates endothelial cell proliferation and migration, its role in pericyte biology is less clear. Here we define a role for VEGF as an inhibitor of neovascularization on the basis of its capacity to disrupt VSMC function. Specifically, under conditions of PDGF- mediated angiogenesis, VEGF ablates pericyte coverage of nascent vascular sprouts, leading to vessel destabilization. At the molecular level, VEGF- mediated activation of VEGF- R2 suppresses PDGF- R beta signalling in VSMCs through the assembly of a previously undescribed receptor complex consisting of PDGF- Rb and VEGF- R2. Inhibition of VEGF- R2 not only prevents assembly of this receptor complex but also restores angiogenesis in tissues exposed to both VEGF and PDGF. Finally, genetic deletion of tumour cell VEGF disrupts PDGF-R beta/VEGF-R2 complex formation and increases tumour vessel maturation. These findings underscore the importance of VSMCs/ pericytes in neovascularization(8,9) and reveal a dichotomous role forVEGF and VEGF-R2 signalling as both a promoter of endothelial cell function and a negative regulator of VSMCs and vessel maturation.","[Shields, David J.; Acevedo, Lisette M.; Murphy, Eric; Huang, Jianhua; Scheppke, Lea; Cheresh, David A.] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Pathol, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Greenberg, Joshua I.; Barillas, Samuel G.; Angle, Niren] Univ Calif San Diego, Sch Med, Dept Surg, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Shields, David J.; Acevedo, Lisette M.; Murphy, Eric; Huang, Jianhua; Scheppke, Lea; Cheresh, David A.] Univ Calif San Diego, Moores UCSD Canc Ctr, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Stockmann, Christian; Johnson, Randall S.] Univ Calif San Diego, Div Biol, Mol Biol Sect, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA","Cheresh, DA (reprint author), Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Pathol, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.",dcheresh@ucsd.edu,"Stockmann, Christian/L-6956-2017","Johnson, Randall/0000-0002-4084-6639","National Institutes of Health [R37-CA50286, CA082515, GM 68524]; University of California Academic Senate Grant; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft [DFG STO 787/1-1]; Institutional Research and Academic Career Development Award","We thank D.

Infiltration by cells of the myeloid lineage is a hallmark of many tumours, and in many cases the macrophages in these infiltrates express VEGF-A(2). Here we show that the deletion of inflammatory-cell-derived VEGF- A attenuates the formation of a typical high-density vessel network, thus blocking the angiogenic switch in solid tumours in mice. Vasculature in tumours lacking myeloid- cell-derived VEGF-A was less tortuous, with increased pericyte coverage and decreased vessel length, indicating vascular normalization. In addition, loss of myeloid-derived VEGF- A decreases the phosphorylation of VEGF receptor 2 (VEGFR2) in tumours, even though overall VEGF- A levels in the tumours are unaffected. However, deletion of myeloid- cell VEGF- A resulted in an accelerated tumour progression in multiple subcutaneous isograft models and an autochthonous transgenic model of mammary tumorigenesis, with less overall tumour cell death and decreased tumour hypoxia. Furthermore, loss of myeloid- cell VEGF- A increased the susceptibility of tumours to chemotherapeutic cytotoxicity. This shows that myeloid- derived VEGF- A is essential for the tumorigenic alteration of vasculature and signalling to VEGFR2, and that these changes act to retard, not promote, tumour progression.","[Stockmann, Christian; Doedens, Andrew; Weidemann, Alexander; Zhang, Na; Takeda, Norihiko; Johnson, Randall S.] Univ Calif San Diego, Div Biol Sci, Mol Biol Sect, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Greenberg, Joshua I.] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Surg, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Cheresh, David A.] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Pathol, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Cheresh, David A.] Univ Calif San Diego, Moores Canc Ctr, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA","Johnson, RS (reprint author), Univ Calif San Diego, Div Biol Sci, Mol Biol Sect, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.",rsjohnson@ucsd.edu,"Stockmann, Christian/L-6956-2017","Doedens, Andrew/0000-0003-2461-3496; Johnson, Randall/0000-0002-4084-6639","Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft [STO 787/1-1, WE 4275/1-1]; Susan G.

The cellular response to genotoxic DNA breaks includes the activation of transcriptional programs known primarily to regulate cell- cycle checkpoints and cell survival(1-5). DNA double- strand breaks are generated in all developing lymphocytes during the assembly of antigen receptor genes, a process that is essential for normal lymphocyte development. Here we show that in murine lymphocytes these physiological DNA breaks activate a broad transcriptional program. This program transcends the canonical DNA double- strand break response and includes many genes that regulate diverse cellular processes important for lymphocyte development. Moreover, the expression of several of these genes is regulated similarly in response to genotoxic DNA damage. Thus, physiological DNA double- strand breaks provide cues that can regulate cell- type- specific processes not directly involved in maintaining the integrity of the genome, and genotoxic DNA breaks could disrupt normal cellular functions by corrupting these processes.","[Bredemeyer, Andrea L.; Helmink, Beth A.; Calderon, Boris; McGinnis, Lisa M.; Mahowald, Grace K.; Gapud, Eric J.; Walker, Laura M.; Weaver, Brian K.; Mandik-Nayak, Laura; Schreiber, Robert D.; Allen, Paul M.; Sleckman, Barry P.] Washington Univ, Sch Med, Dept Pathol & Immunol, St Louis, MO 63110 USA; [Innes, Cynthia L.; Collins, Jennifer B.; Paules, Richard S.] NIEHS, Environm Stress & Canc Grp, Res Triangle Pk, NC 27709 USA; [Innes, Cynthia L.; Collins, Jennifer B.; Paules, Richard S.] NIEHS, Microarray Grp, Res Triangle Pk, NC 27709 USA; [May, Michael J.] Univ Penn, Sch Vet Med, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Bassing, Craig H.] Univ Penn, Sch Med, Childrens Hosp Philadelphia, Ctr Childhood Canc Res,Dept Pathol & Lab Med, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Bassing, Craig H.] Abramson Family Canc Res Inst, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA","Sleckman, BP (reprint author), Washington Univ, Sch Med, Dept Pathol & Immunol, St Louis, MO 63110 USA.",Sleckman@immunology.wustl.edu,"Schreiber, Robert/A-1276-2013","Schreiber, Robert/0000-0001-6311-0432; May, Michael/0000-0002-2485-3716; Calderon, Boris/0000-0003-1575-0739; Bredemeyer, Andrea/0000-0003-2970-5998",National Institutes of Health [AI47829]; Washington University Department of Pathology and Immunology; Department of Pathology and Center for Childhood Cancer Research of the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia; Abramson Family Cancer Research Institute; National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences; Research Scholar Award from the American Cancer Society,"We thank J.

Studies on diverse cancers, including melanoma, have indicated that only rare human cancer cells ( 0.1 - 0.0001%) form tumours when transplanted into non- obese diabetic/ severe combined immunodeficiency ( NOD/ SCID) mice. However, the extent to which NOD/ SCID mice underestimate the frequency of tumorigenic human cancer cells has been uncertain. Here we show that modified xenotransplantation assay conditions, including the use of more highly immunocompromised NOD/ SCID interleukin- 2 receptor gamma chain null (Il2rg(-/-)) mice, can increase the detection of tumorigenic melanoma cells by several orders of magnitude. In limiting dilution assays, approximately 25% of unselected melanoma cells from 12 different patients, including cells from primary and metastatic melanomas obtained directly from patients, formed tumours under these more permissive conditions. In single- cell transplants, an average of 27% of unselected melanoma cells from four different patients formed tumours. Modifications to xenotransplantation assays can therefore dramatically increase the detectable frequency of tumorigenic cells, demonstrating that they are common in some human cancers.","[Quintana, Elsa; Shackleton, Mark; Morrison, Sean J.] Univ Michigan, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Inst Life Sci, Dept Internal Med, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Quintana, Elsa; Shackleton, Mark; Morrison, Sean J.] Univ Michigan, Ctr Cell Biol, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Sabel, Michael S.] Univ Michigan, Dept Surg, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Fullen, Douglas R.] Univ Michigan, Dept Pathol, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Johnson, Timothy M.] Univ Michigan, Dept Dermatol, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA","Morrison, SJ (reprint author), Univ Michigan, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Inst Life Sci, Dept Internal Med, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",seanjm@umich.edu,"Sabel, Michael/A-7521-2009","Morrison, Sean/0000-0003-1587-8329","Howard Hughes Medical Institute; Allen H.

A decline in stem cell function has been proposed to contribute to tissue ageing, although the underlying mechanism is poorly understood. Here we show that changes in the stem cell orientation with respect to the niche during ageing contribute to the decline in spermatogenesis in the male germ line of Drosophila. Throughout the cell cycle, centrosomes in germline stem cells ( GSCs) are oriented within their niche and this ensures asymmetric division. We found that GSCs containing misoriented centrosomes accumulate with age and that these GSCs are arrested or delayed in the cell cycle. The cell cycle arrest is transient, and GSCs appear to re- enter the cell cycle on correction of centrosome orientation. On the basis of these findings, we propose that cell cycle arrest associated with centrosome misorientation functions as a mechanism to ensure asymmetric stem cell division, and that the inability of stem cells to maintain correct orientation during ageing contributes to the decline in spermatogenesis. We also show that some of the misoriented GSCs probably originate from dedifferentiation of spermatogonia.","[Turkel, Nezaket; Hemati, Nahid; Yamashita, Yukiko M.] Univ Michigan, Inst Life Sci, Ctr Stem Cell Biol, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Cheng, Jun; Hunt, Alan J.] Univ Michigan, Dept Biomed Engn, Ctr Ultrafast Opt Sci, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Yamashita, Yukiko M.] Univ Michigan, Dept Cell & Dev Biol, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Fuller, Margaret T.] Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Dept Dev Biol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Fuller, Margaret T.] Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Dept Genet, Stanford, CA 94305 USA","Yamashita, YM (reprint author), Univ Michigan, Inst Life Sci, Ctr Stem Cell Biol, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",yukikomy@umich.edu,,"Fuller, Margaret T/0000-0002-3804-4987; Yamashita, Yukiko/0000-0001-5541-0216","University of Michigan; March of Dimes Basil O'Conner Starter Scholar Research Award; Searle Scholar Program; NIH [P01 DK53074, R01GM072006]","We thank C.

Here we show that mitofusin 2, a mitochondrial dynamin- related protein mutated in the inherited motor neuropathy Charcot - Marie - Tooth type IIa, is enriched at the ER - mitochondria interface. Ablation or silencing of mitofusin 2 in mouse embryonic fibroblasts and HeLa cells disrupts ER morphology and loosens ER - mitochondria interactions, thereby reducing the efficiency of mitochondrial Ca(2+) uptake in response to stimuli that generate inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate. An in vitro assay as well as genetic and biochemical evidences support a model in which mitofusin 2 on the ER bridges the two organelles by engaging in homotypic and heterotypic complexes with mitofusin 1 or 2 on the surface of mitochondria. Thus, mitofusin 2 tethers ER to mitochondria, a juxtaposition required for efficient mitochondrial Ca(2+) uptake.","[de Brito, Olga Martins; Scorrano, Luca] Venetian Inst Mol Med, Dulbecco Telethon Inst, I-35129 Padua, Italy; [Scorrano, Luca] Univ Geneva, Dept Cell Physiol & Metab, CH-1211 Geneva, Switzerland","Scorrano, L (reprint author), Venetian Inst Mol Med, Dulbecco Telethon Inst, Via Orus 2, I-35129 Padua, Italy.",lscorrano@dti.telethon.it,"Scorrano, Luca/A-6652-2008","Scorrano, Luca/0000-0002-8515-8928",Telethon Italy; Compagnia di San Paolo Italy; United Mitochondrial Disease Foundation USA; Muscular Distrophy Association USA; Swiss National Science Foundation [3100A0-118171],"O.M.d.B. received a 'Bolsa de Doutoramento' of FCT Portugal.

Motility defects in cilia and flagella often result in primary ciliary dyskinesia. However, the mechanisms underlying cilia formation and function, and in particular the cytoplasmic assembly of dyneins that power ciliary motility, are only poorly understood. Here we report a new gene, kintoun ( ktu), involved in this cytoplasmic process. This gene was first identified in a medaka mutant, and found to be mutated in primary ciliary dyskinesia patients from two affected families as well as in the pf13 mutant of Chlamydomonas. In the absence of Ktu/ PF13, both outer and inner dynein arms are missing or defective in the axoneme, leading to a loss of motility. Biochemical and immunohistochemical studies show that Ktu/ PF13 is one of the long- sought proteins involved in pre- assembly of dynein arm complexes in the cytoplasm before intraflagellar transport loads them for the ciliary compartment.","[Omran, Heymut; Olbrich, Heike; Loges, Niki T.; Fliegauf, Manfred] Univ Hosp Freiburg, Dept Pediat & Adolescent Med, D-79106 Freiburg, Germany; [Kobayashi, Daisuke; Yagi, Toshiki; Koshida, Sumito; Kamiya, Ritsu; Takeda, Hiroyuki] Univ Tokyo, Dept Biol Sci, Grad Sch Sci, Tokyo 1130033, Japan; [Tsukahara, Tatsuya; Watanabe, Yoshinori] Univ Tokyo, Inst Mol & Cellular Biosci, Grad Sch Sci, Tokyo 1130033, Japan; [Tsukahara, Tatsuya; Watanabe, Yoshinori] Univ Tokyo, Grad Program Biophys & Biochem, Grad Sch Sci, Tokyo 1130033, Japan; [Hagiwara, Haruo] Gunma Univ, Grad Sch Med, Dept Anat & Cell Biol, Gunma 3718511, Japan; [Zhang, Qi; Leblond, Gerard; Mitchell, David R.] SUNY Upstate Med Univ, Dept Cell & Dev Biol, Syracuse, NY 13210 USA; [O'Toole, Eileen] Univ Colorado, Dept Mol Cellular & Dev Biol, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Hara, Chikako; Mizuno, Hideaki; Kawano, Hiroyuki; Miyawaki, Atsushi] RIKEN, Brain Sci Inst, Adv Technol Dev Grp, Lab Cell Funct Dynam, Wako, Saitama 3510198, Japan; [Zentgraf, Hanswalter] German Canc Res Ctr, Dept Tumor Virol, D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany; [Seithe, Horst] Klinikum Nurnberg Sud, Klin Kinder & Jugendliche, D-90471 Nurnberg, Germany; [Reinhardt, Richard] Max Planck Inst Mol Genet, D-14195 Berlin, Germany","Omran, H (reprint author), Univ Hosp Freiburg, Dept Pediat & Adolescent Med, Mathildenstr 1, D-79106 Freiburg, Germany.",heymut.omran@uniklinik-freiburg.de; MitchelD@upstate.edu; htakeda@biol.s.u-tokyo.ac.jp,"Miyawaki, Atsushi/K-3569-2014; TAKEDA, HIROYUKI/G-4950-2014","Miyawaki, Atsushi/0000-0002-2329-3235; Mitchell, David/0000-0003-2821-7511","NIG Cooperative Research Program; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research Priority Area Genome Science and Scientific Research (A and B); Global COE Program (Integrative Life Science Based on the Study of Biosignaling Mechanisms); Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology ( MEXT) of Japan; Yamada Science Foundation; Bio-Design Project of the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries of Japan; University of Tokyo; MEXT, Japan; ' Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft' [DFG Om 6/4, GRK1104]; BIOSS; NIH [GM44228]; German Ministry of Science and Education ( BMBF) [NGFN-2:01GR0414-PDN-S02T17]; 'Primare Ciliaere Dyskinesie and Kartagener Syndrom e.

They play an important role as cosmological distance indicators and have led to the discovery of the accelerated expansion of the Universe(2,3). Among the most important unsolved questions(4) about supernovae are how the explosion actually proceeds and whether accretion occurs from a companion or by the merging of two white dwarfs. Tycho Brahe's supernova of 1572 ( SN 1572) is thought to be one of the best candidates for a type Ia supernova in the Milky Way(5). The proximity of the SN 1572 remnant has allowed detailed studies, such as the possible identification of the binary companion(6), and provides a unique opportunity to test theories of the explosion mechanism and the nature of the progenitor. The determination of the hitherto unknown(7-9) spectroscopic type of this supernova is crucial in relating these results to the diverse population of type Ia supernovae(10). Here we report an optical spectrum of Tycho's supernova near maximum brightness, obtained from a scattered- light echo more than four centuries after the direct light from the explosion swept past the Earth.

It has long been unclear whether the global pattern arises from differences in cloud top altitude (which was earlier(3) estimated to be 66-72 km), compositional variations or temperature contrasts. Here we report multiwavelength imaging that reveals that the dark low latitudes are dominated by convective mixing which brings the ultraviolet absorbers up from depth. The bright and uniform mid- latitude clouds reside in the 'cold collar', an annulus of cold air characterized by similar to 30K lower temperatures with a positive lapse rate, which suppresses vertical mixing and cuts off the supply of ultraviolet absorbers from below. In low and middle latitudes, the visible cloud top is located at a remarkably constant altitude of 72 +/- 1 km in both the ultraviolet dark and bright regions, indicating that the brightness variations result from compositional differences caused by the colder environment rather than by elevation changes. The cloud top descends to similar to 64 km in the eye of the hemispheric vortex, which appears as a depression in the upper cloud deck. The ultraviolet dark circular streaks enclose the vortex eye and are dynamically connected to it.","[Titov, Dmitry V.; Ignatiev, Nikolay I.; Markiewicz, Wojciech J.] Max Planck Inst Sonnensyst Forsch, D-37191 Katlenburg Lindau, Germany; [Taylor, Fredric W.] Univ Oxford, Clarendon Lab, Subdept Atmospher Ocean & Planetary Phys, Oxford OX1 3PU, England; [Svedhem, Hakan] European Space Agcy, Estec, NL-2200 AG Noordwijk, Netherlands; [Titov, Dmitry V.; Ignatiev, Nikolay I.] Space Res Inst IKI, Moscow 117997, Russia; [Piccioni, Giuseppe] Ist Astrofis Spaziale & Fis Cosmica INAF IASF, I-00133 Rome, Italy; [Drossart, Pierre] Observ Paris, LESIA, F-92195 Meudon, France","Titov, DV (reprint author), Max Planck Inst Sonnensyst Forsch, Max Planck Str 2, D-37191 Katlenburg Lindau, Germany.",Titov@mps.mpg.de,,"`Ignatiev, Nikolay/0000-0002-6358-7094; Piccioni, Giuseppe/0000-0002-7893-6808",UK Science and Technology Facilities Council; Italian (ASI); French (CNES); Russian Foundation for Basic Research,"We thank the European Space Agency (ESA) for its efforts and dedication in implementation of the Venus Express mission and the teams at ESOC and ESAC for operational support.

In this special setting, in which translational symmetry is artificially broken, a variety of new and unusual electronic phases can be promoted(2). Theoretical studies predict complex phase diagrams and suggest the key role of the charge carrier density in determining the systems' ground states. A particularly fascinating system is the conducting interface between the band insulators LaAlO(3) and SrTiO(3) ( ref. 3). Recently two possible ground states have been experimentally identified: a magnetic state(4) and a two- dimensional superconducting condensate(5). Here we use the electric field effect to explore the phase diagramof the system. The electrostatic tuning of the carrier density allows an on/off switching of superconductivity and drives a quantum phase transition(6-8) between a two- dimensional superconducting state and an insulating state. Analyses of the magnetotransport properties in the insulating state are consistent with weak localization and do not provide evidence for magnetism.

Northern high- latitude wetlands contribute significantly to the overall methane emissions from wetlands, but the relative source distribution between tropical and high- latitude wetlands remains uncertain(2,3). As a result, not all the observed spatial and seasonal patterns of atmospheric methane concentrations can be satisfactorily explained, particularly for high northern latitudes. For example, a late- autumn shoulder is consistently observed in the seasonal cycles of atmospheric methane at high- latitude sites(4), but the sources responsible for these increased methane concentrations remain uncertain. Here we report a data set that extends hourly methane flux measurements from a high Arctic setting into the late autumn and early winter, during the onset of soil freezing. We find that emissions fall to a low steady level after the growing season but then increase significantly during the freeze- in period. The integral of emissions during the freeze- in period is approximately equal to the amount of methane emitted during the entire summer season. Three- dimensional atmospheric chemistry and transport model simulations of global atmospheric methane concentrations indicate that the observed early winter emission burst improves the agreement between the simulated seasonal cycle and atmospheric data from latitudes north of 60 degrees N. Our findings suggest that permafrost- associated freeze- in bursts of methane emissions from tundra regions could be an important and so far unrecognized component of the seasonal distribution of methane emissions from high latitudes.","[Mastepanov, Mikhail; Strom, Lena; Christensen, Torben R.] Lund Univ, Geobiosphere Sci Ctr, S-22362 Lund, Sweden; [Sigsgaard, Charlotte] Univ Copenhagen, Inst Geog & Geol, DK-1350 Copenhagen, Denmark; [Dlugokencky, Edward J.] NOAA, Earth Syst Res Lab, Boulder, CO 80305 USA; [Houweling, Sander] SRON, Netherlands Inst Space Res, NL-3584 CA Utrecht, Netherlands; [Houweling, Sander] Univ Utrecht, Inst Marine & Atmospher Res Utrecht IMAU, NL-3584 CC Utrecht, Netherlands; [Tamstorf, Mikkel P.] Univ Aarhus, Natl Environm Res Inst, DK-4000 Roskilde, Denmark","Christensen, TR (reprint author), Lund Univ, Geobiosphere Sci Ctr, Solvegatan 12, S-22362 Lund, Sweden.",Torben.Christensen@nateko.lu.se,"Tamstorf, Mikkel/I-7101-2013; Mastepanov, Mikhail/G-1235-2016","Tamstorf, Mikkel/0000-0002-2811-331X; Mastepanov, Mikhail/0000-0002-5543-0302",Danish Ministry of the Environment; Commission for Scientific Research in Greenland (KVUG); Swedish Research Councils VR; FORMAS,This work was carried out under the auspices of the GeoBasis programme and part of the Zackenberg Ecological Research Operations funded by the Danish Ministry of the Environment and the ISICaB project funded by the Commission for Scientific Research in Greenland (KVUG).

In March 2005, the Sunda megathrust ruptured again, producing an event(5) of moment magnitude (M(w)) 8.6 south of the 2004 rupture area, which was the site of a similar event in 1861 (ref. 6). Concern was then focused on the Mentawai area, where large earthquakes had occurred in 1797 ( M(w) = 8.8) and 1833 (M(w) = 9.0)(6,7). Two earthquakes, one of M(w) = 8.4 and, twelve hours later, one of M(w) = 7.9, indeed occurred there on 12 September 2007. Here we show that these earthquakes ruptured only a fraction of the area ruptured in 1833 and consist of distinct asperities within a patch of the megathrust that had remained locked in the interseismic period. This indicates that the same portion of a megathrust can rupture in different patterns depending on whether asperities break as isolated seismic events or cooperate to produce a larger rupture. This variability probably arises from the influence of non- permanent barriers, zones with locally lower pre- stress due to the past earthquakes. The stress state of the portion of the Sunda megathrust that had ruptured in 1833 and 1797 was probably not adequate for the development of a single large rupture in 2007. Themoment released in 2007 amounts to only a fraction both of that released in 1833 and of the deficit of moment that had accumulated as a result of interseismic strain since 1833. The potential for a large megathrust event in the Mentawai area thus remains large.","[Konca, A.

Whereas the proximal part of the tetrapod limb skeleton can easily be homologized with the paired fin skeletons of sarcopterygian ( lobe- finned) fish, there has been much debate about the origin of digits. Early hypotheses(1) interpreted digits as derivatives of fin radials, but during the 1990s the idea gained acceptance that digits are evolutionary novelties without direct equivalents in fish fin skeletons. This was partly based on developmental genetic data(2), but also substantially on the pectoral fin skeleton of the elpistostegid ( transitional fish/ tetrapod) Panderichthys, which appeared to lack distal digit- like radials(3). Here we present a CT scan study of an undisturbed pectoral fin of Panderichthys demonstrating that the plate- like 'ulnare' of previous reconstructions is an artefact and that distal radials are in fact present. This distal portion is more tetrapod- like than that found in Tiktaalik(4) and, in combination with new data about fin development in basal actinopterygians(5), sharks(6) and lungfish(7), makes a strong case for fingers not being a novelty of tetrapods but derived from pre- existing distal radials present in all sarcopterygian fish.","[Boisvert, Catherine A.; Ahlberg, Per E.] Uppsala Univ, Subdept Evolutionary Organismal Biol, Dept Physiol & Dev Biol, Evolutionary Biol Ctr, S-75236 Uppsala, Sweden; [Mark-Kurik, Elga] Tallinn Univ Technol, Inst Geol, EE-19086 Tallinn, Estonia","Boisvert, CA (reprint author), Uppsala Univ, Subdept Evolutionary Organismal Biol, Dept Physiol & Dev Biol, Evolutionary Biol Ctr, Norbyvagen 18A, S-75236 Uppsala, Sweden.",catherine.boisvert@ebc.uu.se,"Ahlberg, Per/E-8086-2013",,Vetenskapsradet,"We thank P.

Such signals could then control electrical stimulation of muscles, thereby restoring volitional movement to paralysed limbs(1-3). In previously separate experiments, activity of motor cortex neurons related to actual or imagined movements has been used to control computer cursors and robotic arms(4-10), and paralysed muscles have been activated by functional electrical stimulation(11-13). Here we show that Macaca nemestrina monkeys can directly control stimulation of muscles using the activity of neurons in the motor cortex, thereby restoring goal-directed movements to a transiently paralysed arm. Moreover, neurons could control functional stimulation equally well regardless of any previous association to movement, a finding that considerably expands the source of control signals for brain- machine interfaces. Monkeys learned to use these artificial connections from cortical cells to muscles to generate bidirectional wrist torques, and controlled multiple neuron - muscle pairs simultaneously. Such direct transforms from cortical activity to muscle stimulation could be implemented by autonomous electronic circuitry, creating a relatively natural neuroprosthesis. These results are the first demonstration that direct artificial connections between cortical cells and muscles can compensate for interrupted physiological pathways and restore volitional control of movement to paralysed limbs.","[Moritz, Chet T.; Perlmutter, Steve I.; Fetz, Eberhard E.] Univ Washington, Dept Physiol & Biophys, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Moritz, Chet T.; Perlmutter, Steve I.; Fetz, Eberhard E.] Univ Washington, Washington Natl Primate Res Ctr, Seattle, WA 98195 USA","Moritz, CT (reprint author), Univ Washington, Dept Physiol & Biophys, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.",ctmoritz@u.washington.edu,,"Perlmutter, Steve/0000-0002-1149-4152",National Institutes of Health,"We thank L.

However, the origins of the lymphatic system in the embryo, and the mechanisms that direct growth of the network of lymphatic vessels, remain unclear. Lymphatic vessels are thought to arise from endothelial precursor cells budding from the cardinal vein under the influence of the lymphatic hallmark gene Prox1 ( prospero homeobox 1; ref. 4). Defects in the transcription factor gene SOX18 ( SRY ( sex determining region Y) box 18) cause lymphatic dysfunction in the human syndrome hypotrichosis- lymphoedema- telangiectasia(5), suggesting that Sox18 may also play a role in lymphatic development or function. Here we use molecular, cellular and genetic assays in mice to show that Sox18 acts as a molecular switch to induce differentiation of lymphatic endothelial cells. Sox18 is expressed in a subset of cardinal vein cells that later co- express Prox1 and migrate to form lymphatic vessels. Sox18 directly activates Prox1 transcription by binding to its proximal promoter. Overexpression of Sox18 in blood vascular endothelial cells induces them to express Prox1 and other lymphatic endothelial markers, while Sox18- null embryos show a complete blockade of lymphatic endothelial cell differentiation from the cardinal vein. Our findings demonstrate a critical role for Sox18 in developmental lymphangiogenesis, and suggest new avenues to investigate for therapeutic management of human lymphangiopathies.","[Francois, Mathias; Hosking, Brett; Wilhelm, Dagmar; Browne, Catherine; Downes, Meredith; Davidson, Tara; Tutt, Desmond; Muscat, George E.

Subtilase cytotoxin (SubAB) is an AB5 toxin secreted by Shiga toxigenic Escherichia coli (STEC)(1), which causes serious gastrointestinal disease in humans(2). SubAB causes haemolytic uraemic syndrome- like pathology in mice(3) through SubA- mediated cleavage of BiP/GRP78, an essential endoplasmic reticulum chaperone(4). Here we show that SubB has a strong preference for glycans terminating in the sialic acid N- glycolylneuraminic acid (Neu5Gc), a monosaccharide not synthesized in humans. Structures of SubB - Neu5Gc complexes revealed the basis for this specificity, and mutagenesis of key SubB residues abrogated in vitro glycan recognition, cell binding and cytotoxicity. SubAB specificity for Neu5Gc was confirmed using mouse tissues with a human- like deficiency of Neu5Gc and human cell lines fed with Neu5Gc. Despite lack of Neu5Gc biosynthesis in humans, assimilation of dietary Neu5Gc creates high- affinity receptors on human gut epithelia and kidney vasculature. This, and the lack of Neu5Gc- containing body fluid competitors in humans, confers susceptibility to the gastrointestinal and systemic toxicities of SubAB. Ironically, foods rich in Neu5Gc are the most common source of STEC contamination. Thus a bacterial toxin's receptor is generated by metabolic incorporation of an exogenous factor derived from food.","[Lofling, Jonas C.; Varki, Nissi M.; Varki, Ajit] Univ Calif San Diego, Glycobiol Res & Training Ctr, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Byres, Emma; Wilce, Matthew C.

Zona pellucida filament components ZP3 and ZP2 act as sperm receptors, and mice lacking either of the corresponding genes produce oocytes without a zona pellucida and are completely infertile(2). Like their counterparts in the vitelline envelope of non- mammalian eggs and many other secreted eukaryotic proteins, zona pellucida subunits polymerize using a 'zona pellucida ( ZP) domain' module(3-5), whose conserved amino- terminal part (ZP-N) was suggested to constitute a domain of its own(6). No atomic structure has been reported for ZP domain proteins, and there is no structural information on any conserved vertebrate protein that is essential for fertilization and directly involved in egg - sperm binding. Here we describe the 2.3 angstrom (angstrom) resolution structure of the ZP-N fragment of mouse primary sperm receptor ZP3. The ZP- N fold defines a new immunoglobulin superfamily subtype with a beta-sheet extension characterized by an E' strand and an invariant tyrosine residue implicated in polymerization. The structure strongly supports the presence of ZP- N repeats within the N- terminal region of ZP2 and other vertebrate zona pellucida/ vitelline envelope proteins, with implications for overall egg coat architecture, the post- fertilization block to polyspermy and speciation. Moreover, it provides an important framework for understanding human diseases caused by mutations in ZP domain proteins and developing new methods of non- hormonal contraception.","[Monne, Magnus; Han, Ling; Schwend, Thomas; Burendahl, Sofia; Jovine, Luca] Karolinska Inst, Dept Biosci & Nutr, SE-14157 Huddinge, Sweden","Jovine, L (reprint author), Karolinska Inst, Dept Biosci & Nutr, Halsovagen 7, SE-14157 Huddinge, Sweden.",luca.jovine@ki.se,"Jovine, Luca/E-8170-2010; Monne, Magnus/D-5642-2012","Jovine, Luca/0000-0002-2679-6946; Monne, Magnus/0000-0003-2344-3878",Karolinska Institutet; Swedish Research Council [2005-5102]; European Community [Marie Curie ERG 31055],"This work was supported by Karolinska Institutet, the Swedish Research Council (grant 2005-5102) and European Community (Marie Curie ERG 31055).

The localization of TLR9 and TLR7 to intracellular compartments seems to have a role in facilitating responses to viral nucleic acids while maintaining tolerance to self nucleic acids, yet the cell biology regulating the transport and localization of these receptors remains poorly understood(4-6). Here we define the route by which TLR9 and TLR7 exit the endoplasmic reticulum and travel to endolysosomes in mouse macrophages and dendritic cells. The ectodomains of TLR9 and TLR7 are cleaved in the endolysosome, such that no full- length protein is detectable in the compartment where ligand is recognized. Notably, although both the full- length and cleaved forms of TLR9 are capable of binding ligand, only the processed form recruits MyD88 on activation, indicating that this truncated receptor, rather than the full- length form, is functional. Furthermore, conditions that prevent receptor proteolysis, including forced TLR9 surface localization, render the receptor non- functional. We propose that ectodomain cleavage represents a strategy to restrict receptor activation to endolysosomal compartments and prevent TLRs from responding to self nucleic acids.","[Ewald, Sarah E.; Lee, Bettina L.; Lau, Laura; Wickliffe, Katherine E.; Barton, Gregory M.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Div Immunol & Pathogenesis, Dept Mol & Cell Biol, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Shi, Guo-Ping] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Med, Brigham & Womens Hosp, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Chapman, Harold A.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Med, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; [Chapman, Harold A.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Inst Cardiovasc Res, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA","Barton, GM (reprint author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Div Immunol & Pathogenesis, Dept Mol & Cell Biol, 405 Life Sci Addit, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",barton@berkeley.edu,,,"Novel Research Grant; The Lupus Research Institute; Hellman Faculty Fund; NIH [HL67204, CA009179, AI072429]","We thank members of the Barton and Vance laboratories for discussions, S.

Here we show that oestrogen-ER and tamoxifen ER complexes directly repress ERBB2 transcription by means of a cis- regulatory element within the ERBB2 gene in human cell lines. We implicate the paired box 2 gene product ( PAX2), in a previously unrecognized role, as a crucial mediator of ER repression of ERBB2 by the anti- cancer drug tamoxifen. Weshow that PAX2 and the ER co-activator AIB-1/SRC-3 compete for binding and regulation of ERBB2 transcription, the outcome of which determines tamoxifen response in breast cancer cells. The repression of ERBB2 by ER-PAX2 links these two breast cancer subtypes and suggests that aggressive ERBB2- positive tumours can originate from ER- positive luminal tumours by circumventing this repressive mechanism. These data provide mechanistic insight into the molecular basis of endocrine resistance in breast cancer.","[Hurtado, Antoni; Holmes, Kelly A.; Howat, William J.; Carroll, Jason S.] Cambridge Res Inst, Canc Res UK, Li Ka Shing Ctr, Cambridge CB2 0RE, England; [Geistlinger, Timothy R.; Brown, Myles] Dana Farber Canc Inst, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Geistlinger, Timothy R.; Brown, Myles] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Hutcheson, Iain R.; Nicholson, Robert I.] Cardiff Univ, Tenovus Ctr Canc Res, Welsh Sch Pharm, Cardiff CF10 3XF, Wales; [Jiang, Jie; Ali, Simak] Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Hammersmith Hosp, London W12 0NN, England","Carroll, JS (reprint author), Cambridge Res Inst, Canc Res UK, Li Ka Shing Ctr, Robinson Way, Cambridge CB2 0RE, England.",jason.carroll@cancer.org.uk,,"Brown, Myles/0000-0002-8213-1658; Carroll, Jason/0000-0003-3643-0080",National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Disease [R01DK074967]; National Cancer Institute [P01CA8011105]; DF/HCC Breast Cancer SPORE; University of Cambridge; Cancer Research UK; Hutchison Whampoa Limited,"We thank D.

This can instigate genomic instability resulting from a gain or loss of DNA(1). Assembly of DNA into silent chromatin is generally thought to serve as a mechanism ensuring repeat stability by limiting access to the recombination machinery(2). Consistent with this notion is the observation, in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, that stability of the highly repetitive ribosomal DNA( rDNA) sequences requires a Sir2- containing chromatin silencing complex that also inhibits transcription from foreign promoters and transposons inserted within the repeats by a process called rDNA silencing(2-5). Here we describe a protein network that stabilizes rDNA repeats of budding yeast by means of interactions between rDNA- associated silencing proteins and two proteins of the inner nuclear membrane (INM). Deletion of either the INM or silencing proteins reduces perinuclear rDNA positioning, disrupts the nucleolus nucleoplasm boundary, induces the formation of recombination foci, and destabilizes the repeats. In addition, artificial targeting of rDNA repeats to the INM suppresses the instability observed in cells lacking an rDNA- associated silencing protein that is typically required for peripheral tethering of the repeats. Moreover, in contrast to Sir2 and its associated nucleolar factors, the INM proteins are not required for rDNA silencing, indicating that Sir2-dependent silencing is not sufficient to inhibit recombination within the rDNA locus. These findings demonstrate a role for INM proteins in the perinuclear localization of chromosomes and show that tethering to the nuclear periphery is required for the stability of rDNA repeats. The INM proteins studied here are conserved and have been implicated in chromosome organization in metazoans(6,7). Our results therefore reveal an ancient mechanism in which interactions between INM proteins and chromosomal proteins ensure genome stability.","[Mekhail, Karim; Moazed, Danesh] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Mekhail, Karim; Seebacher, Jan; Gygi, Steven P.; Moazed, Danesh] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Cell Biol, Boston, MA 02115 USA","Moazed, D (reprint author), Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Boston, MA 02115 USA.",danesh@hms.harvard.edu,,,National Institutes of Health; Howard Hughes Medical Institute; Canadian Institutes of Health Research Institute of Aging,"We thank C.

By binding to a nuclear receptor, GIBBERELLIN INSENSITIVE DWARF1 (GID1), gibberellins regulate gene expression by promoting degradation of the transcriptional regulator DELLA proteins, including GIBBERELLIN INSENSITIVE ( GAI). The precise manner in which GID1 discriminates and becomes activated by bioactive gibberellins for specific binding to DELLA proteins remains unclear. Here we present the crystal structure of a ternary complex of Arabidopsis thaliana GID1A, a bioactive gibberellin and the amino- terminal DELLA domain of GAI. In this complex, GID1A occludes gibberellin in a deep binding pocket covered by its N- terminal helical switch region, which in turn interacts with the DELLA domain containing DELLA, VHYNP and LExLE motifs.

These maps provide genome- wide in vivo biochemical footprints confirming the previous prediction that the position of Nova binding determines the outcome of alternative splicing; moreover, they are sufficiently powerful to predict Nova action de novo.

Analyses in which sequence reads are mapped to exon - exon junctions indicated that 92 - 94% of human genes undergo alternative splicing,, 86% with a minor isoform frequency of 15% or more. Differences in isoform- specific read densities indicated that most alternative splicing and alternative cleavage and polyadenylation events vary between tissues, whereas variation between individuals was approximately twofold to threefold less common. Extreme or 'switch-like' regulation of splicing between tissues was associated with increased sequence conservation in regulatory regions and with generation of full- length open reading frames. Patterns of alternative splicing and alternative cleavage and polyadenylation were strongly correlated across tissues, suggesting coordinated regulation of these processes, and sequence conservation of a subset of known regulatory motifs in both alternative introns and 39 untranslated regions suggested common involvement of specific factors in tissue- level regulation of both splicing and polyadenylation.","[Wang, Eric T.; Sandberg, Rickard; Burge, Christopher B.] MIT, Dept Biol, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Wang, Eric T.] Harvard Mit Div Hlth Sci & Technol, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Sandberg, Rickard] Karolinska Inst, Dept Cell & Mol Biol, S-17177 Stockholm, Sweden; [Luo, Shujun; Khrebtukova, Irina; Zhang, Lu; Schroth, Gary P.] Illumina Inc, Hayward, CA 94545 USA; [Mayr, Christine] Whitehead Inst Biomed Res, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; [Kingsmore, Stephen F.] Natl Ctr Genome Resources, Santa Fe, NM 87505 USA","Burge, CB (reprint author), MIT, Dept Biol, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",cburge@mit.edu,,"kingsmore, stephen/0000-0002-3758-4631; Sandberg, Rickard/0000-0001-6473-1740; Kingsmore, Stephen/0000-0001-7180-2527",NIH; Knut & Alice Wallenberg Foundation; Swedish Foundation for Strategic Research,"We thank E.

Tidal deformation of a thin surface crust above an internal ocean could result in tensile and compressive stresses that would affect the width of the fissures(7); therefore, the quantity of water vapour released at different locations in Enceladus' eccentric orbit is a crucial measurement of tidal control of venting. Here we report observations of an occultation of a star by the plume on 24 October 2007 that revealed four high- density gas jets superimposed on the background plume. The gas jet positions coincide with those of dust jets reported elsewhere(8) inside the plume. The maximum water column density in the plume is about twice the density reported earlier(2). The density ratio does not agree with predictions(7)-we should have seen less water than was observed in 2005. The ratio of the jets' bulk vertical velocities to their thermal velocities is 1.5 +/- 0.2, which supports the hypothesis that the source of the plume is liquid water, with gas accelerated to supersonic velocity in nozzle- like channels(9).","[Hansen, C.

For example, in free space, optical tweezers have been widely used to manipulate atoms and microscale dielectric particles(1,2). This optical force is expected to be greatly enhanced in integrated photonic circuits in which light is highly concentrated at the nanoscale(3,4). Harnessing the optical force on a semiconductor chip will allow solid state devices, such as electromechanical systems, to operate under new physical principles. Indeed, recent experiments have elucidated the radiation forces of light in highfinesse optical microcavities(5-7), but the large footprint of these devices ultimately prevents scaling down to nanoscale dimensions. Recent theoreticalwork has predicted that a transverse optical force can be generated and used directly for electromechanical actuation without the need for a high- finesse cavity(3). However, on- chip exploitation of this force has been a significant challenge, primarily owing to the lack of efficient nanoscale mechanical transducers in the photonics domain. Here we report the direct detection and exploitation of transverse optical forces in an integrated silicon photonic circuit through an embedded nanomechanical resonator. The nanomechanical device, a free-standing waveguide, is driven by the optical force and read out through evanescent coupling of the guided light to the dielectric substrate. This new optical force enables all- optical operation of nanomechanical systems on a CMOS ( complementary metal- oxide- semiconductor)- compatible platform, with substantial bandwidth and design flexibility compared to conventional electrical- based schemes.","[Li, Mo; Pernice, W.

Synthesis of complex natural products is the most demanding arena in which to explore such principles. The bryostatin family of compounds are especially interesting targets, because they combine structural complexity with promising biological activity(3-7). Furthermore, synthetic routes to some bryostatins have already been reported(9-12), providing a benchmark against which new syntheses can be measured. Here we report a concise total synthesis of bryostatin 16 ( 1), a parent structure from which almost all other bryostatins could in principle be accessed. Application of atom-economical and chemoselective reactions currently under development provides ready access to polyhydropyran motifs in the molecule, which are common structural features of many other natural products. The most notable transformations are two transition-metal- catalysed reactions. The first is a palladium- catalysed reaction of two different alkynes to form a large ring. The product of this step is then converted into a dihydropyran ( the 'C ring' of bryostatins) in the second key reaction, which is catalysed by a gold compound. Analogues of bryostatin that do not exist in nature could be readily made by following this route, which might allow the biological activity of bryostatins to be fine- tuned.","[Trost, Barry M.; Dong, Guangbin] Stanford Univ, Dept Chem, Stanford, CA 94305 USA","Trost, BM (reprint author), Stanford Univ, Dept Chem, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",bmtrost@stanford.edu,,,National Institutes of Health [GM 13598],"We acknowledge the National Institutes of Health (GM 13598) for their support of our programs.

Comprehensive ocean measurement programmes aiming to monitor MOC variations have been established in the subtropical North Atlantic(2,3) ( RAPID, at latitude 26.56 degrees N, and MOVE, at latitude 16 degrees N) and show strong variability on intraseasonal to interannual timescales. Observational evidence of longer- term changes in MOC transport remains scarce, owing to infrequent sampling of transoceanic sections over past decades(4,5). Inferences based on long- term sea surface temperature records, however, supported by model simulations, suggest a variability with an amplitude of +/- 1.5-3 Sv ( 1 Sv = 10(6) m(3) s(-1)) on decadal timescales in the subtropics(6). Such variability has been attributed to variations of deep water formation in the sub- arctic Atlantic, particularly the renewal rate of Labrador Sea Water(7). Here we present results from a model simulation that suggest an additional influence on decadal MOC variability having a Southern Hemisphere origin: dynamic signals originating in the Agulhas leakage region at the southern tip of Africa. These contribute a MOC signal in the tropical and subtropical North Atlantic that is of the same order of magnitude as the northern source. A complete rationalization of observed MOC changes therefore also requires consideration of signals arriving from the south.","[Biastoch, A.; Boening, C.

Detrital Hadean igneous zircons from the Jack Hills(1), Western Australia, however, can potentially provide insights into the conditions extant on our planet at that time. Results of geochemical investigations(2-13) using these ancient grains have been interpreted to suggest the presence of a hydrosphere(2-4,7,8) and continental crust(9,10) before 4Gyr. An underexploited characteristic of the >4 Gyr zircons is their diverse assemblage of mineral inclusions(14-17). Here we present an examination of over 400 Hadean zircons from Jack Hills, which shows that some inclusion assemblages are conducive to thermobarometry. Our thermobarometric analyses of 4.02 - 4.19- Gyr- old inclusion- bearing zircons constrain their magmatic formation conditions to about 700 degrees C and 7 kbar. This result implies a near- surface heat flow of similar to 75 mW m(-2), about three to five times lower than estimates of Hadean global heat flow. As the only site of magmatism on modern Earth that is characterized by heat flow of about one- quarter of the global average is above subduction zones, we suggest that the magmas from which the Jack Hills Hadean zircons crystallized were formed largely in an under thrust environment, perhaps similar to modern convergent margins.","[Hopkins, Michelle; Harrison, T.

The anatomy of turtles is highly derived, which renders it difficult to establish the relationships of turtles with other groups of reptiles. The oldest known turtle, Proganochelys from the Late Triassic period of Germany(1), has a fully formed shell and offers no clue as to its origin. Here we describe a new 220- million- year- old turtle from China, somewhat older than Proganochelys, that documents an intermediate step in the evolution of the shell and associated structures. A ventral plastron is fully developed, but the dorsal carapace consists of neural plates only. The dorsal ribs are expanded, and osteoderms are absent. The new species shows that the plastron evolved before the carapace and that the first step of carapace formation is the ossification of the neural plates coupled with a broadening of the ribs. This corresponds to early embryonic stages of carapace formation in extant turtles, and shows that the turtle shell is not derived from a fusion of osteoderms. Phylogenetic analysis places the new species basal to all known turtles, fossil and extant. The marine deposits that yielded the fossils indicate that this primitive turtle inhabited marginal areas of the sea or river deltas.","[Li, Chun] Chinese Acad Sci, Lab Evolut Systemat Vertebrates, Inst Vertebrate Paleontol & Paleoanthropol, Beijing 100044, Peoples R China; [Wu, Xiao-Chun] Canadian Museum Nat, Ottawa, ON K1P 6P4, Canada; [Rieppel, Olivier] Field Museum Nat Hist, Dept Geol, Chicago, IL 60605 USA; [Wang, Li-Ting] Geol Survey Guizhou Prov, Guiyang 550005, Peoples R China; [Zhao, Li-Jun] Zhejiang Museum Nat Hist, Hangzhou 310012, Peoples R China","Li, C (reprint author), Chinese Acad Sci, Lab Evolut Systemat Vertebrates, Inst Vertebrate Paleontol & Paleoanthropol, POB 643, Beijing 100044, Peoples R China.",lichun@ivpp.ac.cn; xcwu@mus-nature.ca,,,"Major Basic Research Projects [2006CB806400]; Ministry of Science and Technology of China; National Natural Science Foundation [40772015, 40121202]; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Canadian Museum of Nature [RS 34]; CAS/SAFEA International Partnership Program for Creative Research Teams","We thank Z.

Satellite cells reside as quiescent cells underneath the basal lamina that surrounds muscle fibres(2) and respond to damage by giving rise to transient amplifying cells ( progenitors) and myoblasts that fuse with myofibres. Recent experiments showed that, in contrast to cultured myoblasts, satellite cells freshly isolated(3-5) or satellite cells derived from the transplantation of one intact myofibre(6) contribute robustly to muscle repair. However, because satellite cells are known to be heterogeneous(4,6,7), clonal analysis is required to demonstrate stem cell function. Here we show that when a single luciferase- expressing muscle stem cell is transplanted into the muscle of mice it is capable of extensive proliferation, contributes to muscle fibres, and Pax7(+) luciferase(+) mononucleated cells can be readily re- isolated, providing evidence of muscle stem cell self- renewal. In addition, we show using in vivo bioluminescence imaging that the dynamics of muscle stem cell behaviour during muscle repair can be followed in a manner not possible using traditional retrospective histological analyses. By imaging luciferase activity, real- time quantitative and kinetic analyses show that donor- derived muscle stem cells proliferate and engraft rapidly after injection until homeostasis is reached. On injury, donor- derived mononucleated cells generate massive waves of cell proliferation. Together, these results show that the progeny of a single luciferase- expressing muscle stem cell can both self- renew and differentiate after transplantation in mice, providing new evidence at the clonal level that self- renewal is an autonomous property of a single adult muscle stem cell.","[Sacco, Alessandra; Doyonnas, Regis; Kraft, Peggy; Vitorovic, Stefan; Blau, Helen M.] Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Dept Microbiol & Immunol, Baxter Lab Genet Pharmacol,Stem Cell Inst, Stanford, CA 94305 USA","Blau, HM (reprint author), Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Dept Microbiol & Immunol, Baxter Lab Genet Pharmacol,Stem Cell Inst, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",hblau@stanford.edu,,,"NIH [AG009521, AG024987]; Baxter Foundation","We thank O.

Its disruption can lead to an array of severe illnesses with major impacts on public health, such as inflammatory bowel disease characterized by self- destructive intestinal immunity. However, the mechanisms regulating the equilibrium between the large bacterial flora and the immune system remain unclear. Intestinal lymphoid tissues generate flora- reactive IgA- producing B cells, and include Peyer's patches and mesenteric lymph nodes, as well as numerous isolated lymphoid follicles (ILFs)(1,2). Here we show that peptidoglycan from Gram- negative bacteria is necessary and sufficient to induce the genesis of ILFs in mice through recognition by the NOD1 ( nucleotide- binding oligomerization domain containing 1) innate receptor in epithelial cells, and beta-defensin 3- and CCL20- mediated signalling through the chemokine receptor CCR6. Maturation of ILFs into large B- cell clusters requires subsequent detection of bacteria by toll- like receptors. In the absence of ILFs, the composition of the intestinal bacterial community is profoundly altered. Our results demonstrate that intestinal bacterial commensals and the immune system communicate through an innate detection system to generate adaptive lymphoid tissues and maintain intestinal homeostasis.","[Bouskra, Djahida; Eberl, Gerard] Inst Pasteur, Lab Lymphoid Tissue Dev, CNRS, URA1961, F-75724 Paris, France; [Brezillon, Christophe] Inst Pasteur, Lab Bacteries Pathogenes Enteriques, F-75724 Paris, France; [Berard, Marion] Inst Pasteur, Anim Centrale, F-75724 Paris, France; [Werts, Catherine; Boneca, Ivo Gomperts] Inst Pasteur, Grp Biol & Genet Bacterial Cell Wall, F-75724 Paris, France; [Varona, Rosa] CSIC, Dept Immunol & Oncol, Ctr Nacl Biotecnol, E-28049 Madrid, Spain; [Werts, Catherine; Boneca, Ivo Gomperts] INSERM, Grp AVENIR, F-75015 Paris, France","Eberl, G (reprint author), Inst Pasteur, Lab Lymphoid Tissue Dev, CNRS, URA1961, 25 Rue Dr Roux, F-75724 Paris, France.",gerard.eberl@pasteur.fr,"Eberl, Gerard/A-1160-2013; Boneca, Ivo/H-1677-2014","Boneca, Ivo/0000-0001-8122-509X; Eberl, Gerard/0000-0002-1119-5638",Institut Pasteur; CNRS; INSERM; ANR; Fondation de la Recherche Medicale; Mairie de Paris; Marie Curie Excellence; La Fondation de France; Ligue Nationale contre le Cancer,"We thank G.

This fatigue is not necessarily correlated with greater central or peripheral fatigue in patients(1), and some patients experience severe fatigue without any demonstrable somatic disease(2). Except in myopathies that are due to specific metabolic defects, the mechanism underlying this type of fatigue remains unknown(2). With no treatment available, this form of inactivity is a major determinant of disability(3). Here we show, using mouse models, that this exaggerated fatigue response is distinct from a loss in specific force production by muscle, and that sarcolemma-localized signalling by neuronal nitric oxide synthase ( nNOS) in skeletal muscle is required to maintain activity after mild exercise. We show that nNOS- null mice do not have muscle pathology and have no loss of muscle- specific force after exercise but do display this exaggerated fatigue response to mild exercise. In mouse models of nNOS mislocalization from the sarcolemma, prolonged inactivity was only relieved by pharmacologically enhancing the cGMP signal that results from muscle nNOS activation during the nitric oxide signalling response to mild exercise. Our findings suggest that the mechanism underlying the exaggerated fatigue response to mild exercise is a lack of contraction- induced signalling from sarcolemma- localized nNOS, which decreases cGMP- mediated vasomodulation in the vessels that supply active muscle after mild exercise. Sarcolemmal nNOS staining was decreased in patient biopsies from a large number of distinct myopathies, suggesting a common mechanism of fatigue. Our results suggest that patients with an exaggerated fatigue response to mild exercise would show clinical improvement in response to treatment strategies aimed at improving exercise- induced signalling.","[Kobayashi, Yvonne M.; Rader, Erik P.; Crawford, Robert W.; Campbell, Kevin P.] Univ Iowa, Roy J & Lucille A Carver Coll Med, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA; [Kobayashi, Yvonne M.; Rader, Erik P.; Crawford, Robert W.; Campbell, Kevin P.] Univ Iowa, Roy J & Lucille A Carver Coll Med, Dept Mol Physiol & Biophys, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA; [Kobayashi, Yvonne M.; Rader, Erik P.; Crawford, Robert W.; Campbell, Kevin P.] Univ Iowa, Roy J & Lucille A Carver Coll Med, Dept Neurol, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA; [Kobayashi, Yvonne M.; Rader, Erik P.; Crawford, Robert W.; Iyengar, Nikhil K.; Parikh, Swapnesh V.; Weiss, Robert M.; Campbell, Kevin P.] Univ Iowa, Roy J & Lucille A Carver Coll Med, Dept Internal Med, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA; [Thedens, Daniel R.] Univ Iowa, Roy J & Lucille A Carver Coll Med, Dept Radiol, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA; [Moore, Steven A.] Univ Iowa, Roy J & Lucille A Carver Coll Med, Dept Pathol, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA; [Faulkner, John A.] Univ Michigan, Dept Mol & Integrat Physiol, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Chamberlain, Jeffrey S.] Univ Washington, Sch Med, Dept Neurol, Seattle, WA 98195 USA","Campbell, KP (reprint author), Univ Iowa, Roy J & Lucille A Carver Coll Med, Howard Hughes Med Inst, 4283 Carver Biomed Res Bldg,285 Newton Rd, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA.",kevin-campbell@uiowa.edu,,,Paul D.

This approach provides a systematic framework for exploring how a given regulatory network generates a particular phenotypic behaviour. Several fundamental gene circuits have been developed using this approach, including toggle switches(7) and oscillators(8-10), and these have been applied in new contexts such as triggered biofilm development(11) and cellular population control(12). Here we describe an engineered genetic oscillator in Escherichia coli that is fast, robust and persistent, with tunable oscillatory periods as fast as 13 min. The oscillator was designed using a previously modelled network architecture comprising linked positive and negative feedback loops(1,13). Using a microfluidic platform tailored for single- cell microscopy, we precisely control environmental conditions and monitor oscillations in individual cells through multiple cycles. Experiments reveal remarkable robustness and persistence of oscillations in the designed circuit; almost every cell exhibited large- amplitude fluorescence oscillations throughout observation runs. The oscillatory period can be tuned by altering inducer levels, temperature and the media source. Computational modelling demonstrates that the key design principle for constructing a robust oscillator is a time delay in the negative feedback loop, which can mechanistically arise from the cascade of cellular processes involved in forming a functional transcription factor. The positive feedback loop increases the robustness of the oscillations and allows for greater tunability. Examination of our refined model suggested the existence of a simplified oscillator design without positive feedback, and we construct an oscillator strain confirming this computational prediction.","[Stricker, Jesse; Cookson, Scott; Bennett, Matthew R.; Mather, William H.; Hasty, Jeff] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Bioengn, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Bennett, Matthew R.; Tsimring, Lev S.; Hasty, Jeff] Univ Calif San Diego, Inst Nonlinear Sci, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA","Hasty, J (reprint author), Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Bioengn, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.",hasty@bioeng.ucsd.edu,"Bennett, Matthew/B-3700-2008","Bennett, Matthew/0000-0002-4975-8854",National Institutes of Health [GM69811-01]; US Department of Defense,"We thank H.

A nuclear GA receptor, GIBBERELLIN INSENSITIVEDWARF1 ( GID1), has a primary structure similar to that of the hormone- sensitive lipases (HSLs)(2,3). Here we analyse the crystal structure of Oryza sativa GID1 (OsGID1) bound with GA(4) and GA(3) at 1.9 angstrom resolution. The overall structure of both complexes shows an alpha/beta-hydrolase fold similar to that of HSLs except for an amino- terminal lid. The GA- binding pocket corresponds to the substrate- binding site of HSLs. On the basis of the OsGID1 structure, we mutagenized important residues for GA binding and examined their binding activities. Almost all of them showed very little or no activity, confirming that the residues revealed by structural analysis are important for GA binding. The replacement of Ile 133 with Leu or Val - residues corresponding to those of the lycophyte Selaginella moellendorffii GID1s - caused an increase in the binding affinity for GA(34), a 2 beta-hydroxylated GA(4). These observations indicate that GID1 originated from HSL and was further modified to have higher affinity and more strict selectivity for bioactive GAs by adapting the amino acids involved in GA binding in the course of plant evolution.","[Nakatsu, Toru; Naoe, Youichi; Kato, Hiroaki] Kyoto Univ, Dept Biol Struct, Grad Sch Pharmaceut Sci, Sakyo Ku, Kyoto 6068501, Japan; [Shimada, Asako; Ueguchi-Tanaka, Miyako; Ohmiya, Hiroko; Matsuoka, Makoto] Nagoya Univ, Biosci & Biotechnol Ctr, Nagoya, Aichi 4648601, Japan; [Nakatsu, Toru; Kato, Hiroaki] RIKEN, Harima Inst SPring 8, Mikazuki, Hyogo 6795148, Japan; [Nakajima, Masatoshi] Univ Tokyo, Dept Appl Biol Chem, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo 1138657, Japan","Kato, H (reprint author), Kyoto Univ, Dept Biol Struct, Grad Sch Pharmaceut Sci, Sakyo Ku, 46-29 Yoshida Shimoadachi Cho, Kyoto 6068501, Japan.",katohiro@pharm.kyoto-u.ac.jp; makoto@nuagr1.agr.nagoya-u.ac.jp,,,"Target Protein Research Program; Scientific Research; Special Coordination Funds for Promoting Science and Technology; Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology of Japan; Japan Society for the Promotion of Science","We thank M.

The functional significance of the resulting DNA damage foci is poorly understood. Here we show that 53BP1 ( also known as TRP53BP1), a component of DNA damage foci, changes the dynamic behaviour of chromatin to promote DNA repair. We used conditional deletion of the shelterin component TRF2 ( also known as TERF2) from mouse cells ( TRF2(fl/-)) to deprotect telomeres, which, like doublestrand breaks, activate the ATM kinase, accumulate 53BP1 and are processed by non- homologous end joining (NHEJ)(1,2). Deletion of TRF2 from 53BP1- deficient cells established that NHEJ of dysfunctional telomeres is strongly dependent on the binding of 53BP1 to damaged chromosome ends. To address the mechanism by which 53BP1 promotes NHEJ, we used time- lapse microscopy to measure telomere dynamics before and after their deprotection. Imaging showed that deprotected telomeres are more mobile and sample larger territories within the nucleus. This change in chromatin dynamics was dependent on 53BP1 and ATM but did not require a functional NHEJ pathway. We propose that the binding of 53BP1 near DNA breaks changes the dynamic behaviour of the local chromatin, thereby facilitating NHEJ repair reactions that involve distant sites, including joining of dysfunctional telomeres and AID ( also known as AICDA)- induced breaks in immunoglobulin class- switch recombination.","[Dimitrova, Nadya; de Lange, Titia] Rockefeller Univ, New York, NY 10065 USA; [Chen, Yi-Chun M.; Spector, David L.] Cold Spring Harbor Lab, Cold Spring Harbor, NY 11724 USA","de Lange, T (reprint author), Rockefeller Univ, 1230 York Ave, New York, NY 10065 USA.",delange@mail.rockefeller.edu,"de Lange, Titia/B-8263-2011","de Lange, Titia/0000-0002-9267-367X","NIH [GM049046]; NIH Director's Pioneer Award [OD000379, EY18244, GM42694]; HHMI pre-doctoral fellowship","We are grateful to J.

A 53BP1- dependent end- joining pathway has been described that is dispensable for V( D) J recombination but essential for class- switch recombination(3,4). Here we report a previously unrecognized defect in the joining phase of V( D) J recombination in 53BP1- deficient lymphocytes that is distinct from that found in classical non- homologous- end- joining-, H2ax-, Mdc1- and Atm- deficient mice. Absence of 53BP1 leads to impairment of distal V - DJ joining with extensive degradation of unrepaired coding ends and episomal signal joint reintegration at V( D) J junctions. This results in apoptosis, loss of T- cell receptor a locus integrity and lymphopenia. Further impairment of the apoptotic checkpoint causes propagation of lymphocytes that have antigen receptor breaks. These data suggest a more general role for 53BP1 in maintaining genomic stability during long- range joining of DNA breaks.","[Difilippantonio, Simone; Wong, Nancy; Chen, Hua Tang; Kruhlak, Michael J.; Callen, Elsa; Nussenzweig, Andre] NCI, Expt Immunol Branch, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Gapud, Eric; Huang, Ching-Yu; Mahowald, Grace; Sleckman, Barry P.] Washington Univ, Sch Med, Dept Pathol & Immunol, St Louis, MO 63110 USA; [Livak, Ferenc] Univ Maryland, Sch Med, Dept Microbiol & Immunol, Baltimore, MD 21201 USA; [Nussenzweig, Michel C.] Rockefeller Univ, Lab Mol Immunol, New York, NY 10021 USA; [Nussenzweig, Michel C.] Howard Hughes Med Inst, New York, NY 10021 USA","Nussenzweig, A (reprint author), NCI, Expt Immunol Branch, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA.",andre_nussenzweig@nih.gov,"Huang, Ching-Yu /E-3981-2010",,NIH [R01AI074953]; Cancer Research Institute; Intramural Research Program; National Cancer Institute; Center for Cancer Research,"We are grateful to M.

However, the role of this single polymorphism in disease initiation and progression remains poorly understood. The lack of Asp 57 creates a positively charged P9 pocket, which confers a preference for negatively charged peptides. Gluten lacks such peptides, but tissue transglutaminase ( TG2) introduces negatively charged residues at defined positions into gluten T- cell epitopes by deamidating specific glutamine residues(5,6) on the basis of their spacing to proline residues(7). The commonly accepted model, proposing that HLA-DQ8 simply favours binding of negatively charged peptides, does not take into account the fact that TG2 requires inflammation for activation(8) and that T- cell responses against native gluten peptides are found(9,10), particularly in children(11). Here we show that beta 57 polymorphism promotes the recruitment of T- cell receptors bearing a negative signature charge in the complementary determining region 3 beta (CDR3 beta) during the response against native gluten peptides presented by HLA-DQ8 in coeliac disease. These T cells showed a crossreactive and heteroclitic ( stronger) response to deamidated gluten peptides. Furthermore, gluten peptide deamidation extended the T- cell- receptor repertoire by relieving the requirement for a charged residue in CDR3 beta. Thus, the lack of a negative charge at position beta 57 in MHC class II was met by negatively charged residues in the T- cell receptor or in the peptide, the combination of which might explain the role of HLA-DQ8 in amplifying the T- cell response against dietary gluten.","[Hovhannisyan, Zaruhi; Martin, Alexandra; Ciszewski, Cezary; Curran, Shane A.; Jabri, Bana] Univ Chicago, Dept Med, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Hovhannisyan, Zaruhi; Martin, Alexandra; Ciszewski, Cezary; Curran, Shane A.; Jabri, Bana] Univ Chicago, Dept Pathol, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Hovhannisyan, Zaruhi; Martin, Alexandra; Ciszewski, Cezary; Curran, Shane A.; Jabri, Bana] Univ Chicago, Dept Pediat, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Hovhannisyan, Zaruhi; Martin, Alexandra; Ciszewski, Cezary; Curran, Shane A.; Jabri, Bana] Univ Chicago, Comm Immunol, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Weiss, Angela] Princeton Univ, Dept Mol Biol, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Wiesner, Martina; Koning, Frits] Leiden Univ, Dept Immunohematol & Blood Transfus, NL-2300 RC Leiden, Netherlands; [Tollefsen, Stig; Sollid, Ludvig M.] Natl Hosp Norway, Ctr Immune Regulat, Inst Immunol, N-0027 Oslo, Norway; [Yoshida, Kenji; Teyton, Luc] Scripps Res Inst, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; [Murray, Joseph A.; David, Chella S.] Mayo Clin, Coll Med, Dept Immunol, Rochester, MN 55905 USA; [Sollid, Ludvig M.] Univ Oslo, Ctr Immune Regulat, Inst Immunol, N-0027 Oslo, Norway","Jabri, B (reprint author), Univ Chicago, Dept Med, 5841 S Maryland Ave, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.",bjabri@bsd.uchicago.edu,"Sollid, Ludvig/N-9691-2015","Sollid, Ludvig/0000-0001-8860-704X; murray, joseph/0000-0003-1941-9090","Digestive Disease Research Core Center of the University of Chicago [DK42086]; NIH [DK67180, DK55037]; Celiac Disease Consortium; EU MC-RTN [512385]; Research Council of Norway; University of Oslo","We thank S.

Renal ammonium production and excretion are essential for net acid excretion under basal conditions and during metabolic acidosis. Ammonium is secreted into the urine by the collecting duct, a distal nephron segment where ammonium transport is believed to occur by non- ionic NH(3) diffusion coupled to H(+) secretion. Here we show that this process is largely dependent on the Rhesus factor Rhcg. Mice lacking Rhcg have abnormal urinary acidification due to impaired ammonium excretion on acid loading - a feature of distal renal tubular acidosis. In vitro microperfused collecting ducts of Rhcg(-/-) acid- loaded mice show reduced apical permeability to NH(3) and impaired transepithelial NH(3) transport. Furthermore, Rhcg is localized in epididymal epithelial cells and is required for normal fertility and epididymal fluid pH. We anticipate a critical role for Rhcg in ammonium handling and pH homeostasis both in the kidney and the male reproductive tract.","[Biver, Sophie; Van Vooren, Pascale; Scohy, Sophie; Szpirer, Josiane; Szpirer, Claude; Marini, Anna Maria] Univ Libre Bruxelles, Inst Biol & Med Mol, Labs Biol Dev & Physiol Mol Cellule, B-6041 Gosselies, Belgium; [Belge, Hendrica; Devuyst, Olivier] Univ Catholique Louvain, Div Nephrol, B-1200 Brussels, Belgium; [Bourgeois, Soline; Nowik, Marta; Wagner, Carsten A.] Univ Zurich, Inst Physiol, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland; [Bourgeois, Soline; Nowik, Marta; Wagner, Carsten A.] Univ Zurich, Zurich Ctr Integrat Human Physiol, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland; [Bourgeois, Soline; Houillier, Pascal] INSERM, UMS 872, F-75006 Paris, France; [Bourgeois, Soline; Houillier, Pascal] Univ Paris 06, F-75006 Paris, France; [Bourgeois, Soline; Houillier, Pascal] Univ Paris 05, F-75006 Paris, France","Marini, AM (reprint author), Univ Libre Bruxelles, Inst Biol & Med Mol, Labs Biol Dev & Physiol Mol Cellule, Rue Prof Jeener & Brachet 12, B-6041 Gosselies, Belgium.",ammarini@dbm.ulb.ac.be,,"Biver, Sophie/0000-0002-7903-2413","Belgian agencies FNRS; FRSM [3.4.546.04.

The human Holliday junction resolvase, GEN1, and its yeast orthologue, Yen1, were independently identified using two distinct experimental approaches: GEN1 was identified by mass spectrometry following extensive fractionation of HeLa cell- free extracts, whereas Yen1 was detected by screening a yeast gene fusion library for nucleases capable of Holliday junction resolution.

Recombinant GEN1 and Yen1 resolve Holliday junctions by the introduction of symmetrically related cuts across the junction point, to produce nicked duplex products in which the nicks can be readily ligated.","[Ip, Stephen C.

All components of the cosmic rays show an intensity that decreases as a power law with increasing energy ( for example as E 22.7). Electrons in particular lose energy rapidly through synchrotron and inverse Compton processes, resulting in a relatively short lifetime ( about 10 5 years) and a rapidly falling intensity, which raises the possibility of seeing the contribution from individual nearby sources ( less than one kiloparsec away)(4). Here we report an excess of galactic cosmic- ray electrons at energies of,300 - 800 GeV, which indicates a nearby source of energetic electrons. Such a source could be an unseen astrophysical object ( such as a pulsar(5) or micro-quasar(6)) that accelerates electrons to those energies, or the electrons could arise from the annihilation of dark matter particles ( such as a Kaluza-Klein particle(7) with a mass of about 620 GeV).","[Guzik, T.

Near this boundary, quantum fluctuations of magnetic degrees of freedom assume the role of phonons in conventional superconductors, creating an attractive interaction that 'glues' electrons into superconducting pairs. Here we show that superconductivity can arise from a very different spectrum of fluctuations associated with a local (or Kondo-breakdown) quantum critical point(2-5) that is revealed in isotropic scattering of charge carriers and a sublinear, temperature-dependent electrical resistivity. At this critical point, accessed by applying pressure to the strongly correlated, local- moment antiferromagnet CeRhIn(5), magnetic and charge fluctuations coexist and produce electronic scattering that is maximal at the optimal pressure for superconductivity. This previously unanticipated source of pairing glue(6) opens possibilities for understanding and discovering new unconventional forms of superconductivity.","[Park, T.; Sidorov, V.

However, essential parameters that determine the electronic quality of the wires, and which have not been controlled yet for the III-V compound semiconductors, are the wire crystal structure and the stacking fault density(5). In addition, a significant feature would be to have a constant spacing between rotational twins in the wires such that a twinning superlattice is formed, as this is predicted to induce a direct bandgap in normally indirect bandgap semiconductors(6,7), such as silicon and gallium phosphide. Optically active versions of these technologically relevant semiconductors could have a significant impact on the electronics(8) and optics(9) industry. Here we show first that we can control the crystal structure of indium phosphide (InP) nanowires by using impurity dopants. We have found that zinc decreases the activation barrier for two- dimensional nucleation growth of zinc- blende InP and therefore promotes crystallization of the InP nanowires in the zinc- blende, instead of the commonly found wurtzite, crystal structure(10). More importantly, we then demonstrate that we can, once we have enforced the zinc- blende crystal structure, induce twinning superlattices with long-range order in InP nanowires. We can tune the spacing of the superlattices by changing the wire diameter and the zinc concentration, and we present a model based on the distortion of the catalyst droplet in response to the evolution of the cross- sectional shape of the nanowires to quantitatively explain the formation of the periodic twinning.","[Algra, Rienk E.; Verheijen, Marcel A.; Borgstrom, Magnus T.; Feiner, Lou-Fe; Immink, George] Philips Res Labs, NL-5656 AE Eindhoven, Netherlands; [Algra, Rienk E.] Mat Innovat Inst M2i, NL-2628 CD Delft, Netherlands; [Algra, Rienk E.; van Enckevort, Willem J.

Large and rapid warming events in Greenland and the North Atlantic were followed by more gradual cooling, and are highly correlated with fluctuations of N2O as recorded in ice cores. Antarctic temperature variations, on the other hand, were smaller and more gradual, showed warming during the Greenland cold phase and cooling while the North Atlantic was warm, and were highly correlated with fluctuations in CO2. Abrupt changes in the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC) have often been invoked to explain the physical characteristics of these Dansgaard - Oeschger climate oscillations(1-3), but the mechanisms for the greenhouse- gas variations and their linkage to the AMOC have remained unclear(4-8). Here we present simulations with a coupled model of glacial climate and biogeochemical cycles, forced only with changes in the AMOC. The model simultaneously reproduces characteristic features of the Dansgaard - Oeschger temperature, as well as CO2 and N2O fluctuations. Despite significant changes in the land carbon inventory, CO2 variations on millennial timescales are dominated by slow changes in the deep ocean inventory of biologically sequestered carbon and are correlated with Antarctic temperature and Southern Ocean stratification. In contrast, N2O co-varies more rapidly with Greenland temperatures owing to fast adjustments of the thermocline oxygen budget. These results suggest that ocean circulation changes were the primary mechanism that drove glacial CO2 and N2O fluctuations on millennial timescales.","[Schmittner, Andreas] Oregon State Univ, Coll Ocean & Atmospher Sci, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA; [Galbraith, Eric D.] Princeton Univ, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA","Schmittner, A (reprint author), Oregon State Univ, Coll Ocean & Atmospher Sci, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA.",aschmitt@coas.oregonstate.edu,"Galbraith, Eric/F-9469-2014; Schmittner, Andreas/O-9647-2015","Galbraith, Eric/0000-0003-4476-4232; Schmittner, Andreas/0000-0002-8376-0843",NSF Marine Geology and Geophysics [0728315-OCE]; NSF Paleoclimate programme [0602395-ATM],"This study was funded by the NSF Marine Geology and Geophysics programme grant 0728315-OCE, and the NSF Paleoclimate programme grant 0602395-ATM.

Because both processes generate seismic energy, geophysical field studies of volcanic processes are often grounded in the interpretation of volcanic earthquakes(3). Although previous seismic studies have provided important constraints on volcano dynamics(4-6), such inversion results do not uniquely constrain magma source dimension and material properties. Here we report combined optical geodetic and seismic observations that robustly constrain the sources of long-period volcanic earthquakes coincident with frequent explosive eruptions at the volcano Santiaguito, in Guatemala. The acceleration of dome deformation, extracted from high- resolution optical image processing, is shown to be associated with recorded long-period seismic sources and the frequency content of seismic signals measured across a broadband network. These earthquake sources are observed as abrupt subvertical surface displacements of the dome, in which 20 - 50- cm uplift originates at the central vent and propagates at similar to 50 m s(-1) towards the 200- m- diameter periphery. Episodic shifts of the 20 - 80- m thick dome induce peak forces greater than 10(9) N and reflect surface manifestations of the volcanic long- period earthquakes, a broad class of volcano seismic activity that is poorly understood and observed at many volcanic centres worldwide(7). On the basis of these observations, the abrupt mass shift of solidified domes, conduit magma or magma pads may play a part in generating long- period earthquakes at silicic volcanic systems.","[Johnson, Jeffrey B.] New Mexico Inst Min & Technol, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, Socorro, NM 87801 USA; [Lees, Jonathan M.] Univ N Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA; [Gerst, Alexander] Univ Hamburg, Inst Geophys, D-20146 Hamburg, Germany; [Sahagian, Dork] Lehigh Univ, Bethlehem, PA 18015 USA; [Varley, Nick] Univ Colima, Fac Ciencias, Colima 28045, Mexico","Johnson, JB (reprint author), New Mexico Inst Min & Technol, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, Socorro, NM 87801 USA.",jeff.johnson@ees.nmt.edu,"Varley, Nick/A-5591-2013","Varley, Nick/0000-0001-9626-4024","US National Science Foundation EAR [0440225, 0440054]","We thank the many personnel involved with instrumentation preparation and field work, including R.

It is commonly believed that during the transition from radial to bilateral symmetry, both openings evolved simultaneously by the lateral closure of a slit- like blastopore(1-4). Molecular phylogenies however, place the acoel flatworms, which have only one opening to their digestive system, as the sister group to all remaining Bilateria(5-7). To address how this single body opening is related to the mouth and anus of the protostomes and deuterostomes, we studied the expression of genes involved in bilaterian foregut and hindgut patterning during the development of the acoel Convolutriloba longifissura. Here we show that the genes brachyury and goosecoid are expressed in association with the acoel mouth, suggesting that this single opening is homologous to the mouth of other bilaterians(8). In addition, we find that the genes caudal, orthopedia and brachyury - which are expressed in various bilaterian hindguts(8-10) - are expressed in a small region at the posterior end of the animal, separated from the anterior oral brachyury- expressing region by a dorsal domain of ectodermal bmp2/4 expression. These results contradict the hypothesis that the bilaterian mouth and anus evolved simultaneously from a common blastoporal opening, and suggest that a through gut might have evolved independently in different animal lineages.","[Hejnol, Andreas; Martindale, Mark Q.] Univ Hawaii, Kewalo Marine Lab, PBRC, Honolulu, HI 96813 USA","Hejnol, A (reprint author), Univ Hawaii, Kewalo Marine Lab, PBRC, 41 Ahui St, Honolulu, HI 96813 USA.",hejnol@hawaii.edu,"Hejnol, Andreas/C-5577-2012","Hejnol, Andreas/0000-0003-2196-8507",National Science Foundation; AToL program [EF05-31558]; NASA; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft [HE5183/2-1],This work is supported by the National Science Foundation under the AToL program (EF05-31558) and NASA to M.

Subsequently, DNA sequences have been published for a number of extinct species. However, such ancient DNA is often fragmented and damaged(3), and studies to date have typically focused on short mitochondrial sequences, never yielding more than a fraction of a per cent of any nuclear genome. Here we describe 4.17 billion bases ( Gb) of sequence from several mammoth specimens, 3.3 billion ( 80%) of which are from the woolly mammoth ( Mammuthus primigenius) genome and thus comprise an extensive set of genome- wide sequence from an extinct species. Our data support earlier reports(4) that elephantid genomes exceed 4 Gb. The estimated divergence rate between mammoth and African elephant is half of that between human and chimpanzee. The observed number of nucleotide differences between two particular mammoths was approximately one- eighth of that between one of them and the African elephant, corresponding to a separation between the mammoths of 1.5 - 2.0 Myr. The estimated probability that orthologous elephant and mammoth amino acids differ is 0.002, corresponding to about one residue per protein. Differences were discovered between mammoth and African elephant in amino- acid positions that are otherwise invariant over several billion years of combined mammalian evolution. This study shows that nuclear genome sequencing of extinct species can reveal population differences not evident from the fossil record, and perhaps even discover genetic factors that affect extinction.","[Miller, Webb; Drautz, Daniela I.; Ratan, Aakrosh; Pusey, Barbara; Qi, Ji; Lesk, Arthur M.; Tomsho, Lynn P.; Packard, Michael D.; Zhao, Fangqing; Schuster, Stephan C.] Penn State Univ, Ctr Comparat Genom & Bioinformat, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Sher, Andrei] Russian Acad Sci, Severtsov Inst Ecol & Evolut, Moscow 119071, Russia; [Tikhonov, Alexei] Russian Acad Sci, Inst Zool, St Petersburg 199034, Russia; [Raney, Brian] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Ctr Biomol Sci & Engn, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA; [Patterson, Nick; Lindblad-Toh, Kerstin; Lander, Eric S.] Broad Inst MIT & Harvard, Cambridge Ctr 7, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; [Fredrikson, Karin M.; Harkins, Timothy T.; Sheridan, Sharon] Roche Diagnost Corp, Indianapolis, IN 46250 USA; [Pringle, Tom] Sperling Fdn, Eugene, OR 97405 USA","Miller, W (reprint author), Penn State Univ, Ctr Comparat Genom & Bioinformat, 310 Wartik Bldg, University Pk, PA 16802 USA.",webb@bx.psu.edu; scs@bx.psu.edu,"Zhao, Fangqing/A-9992-2009; QI, JI/E-2797-2016","Zhao, Fangqing/0000-0002-6216-1235",National Human Genome Research Institute [HG002238]; Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation; Pennsylvania Department of Health using Tobacco Settlement Funds appropriated by the US legislature,"This sequencing-by-synthesis study was made possible through generous funding from Penn State University and Roche Applied Sciences.

Increases in the responses of visual neurons with attention have been extensively studied along the visual processing streams in monkey cerebral cortex, from primary visual areas to parietal and frontal cortex(1-4). Here we show, by recording neurons in attending macaque monkeys ( Macaca mulatta), that attention modulates visual signals before they even reach cortex by increasing responses of both magnocellular and parvocellular neurons in the first relay between retina and cortex, the lateral geniculate nucleus ( LGN). At the same time, attention decreases neuronal responses in the adjacent thalamic reticular nucleus ( TRN). Crick(5) argued for such modulation of the LGN by observing that it is inhibited by the TRN, and suggested that "" the thalamus is the gateway to the cortex, the reticular complex might be described as the guardian of the gateway'', a reciprocal relationship we now show to be more than just hypothesis. The reciprocal modulation in LGN and TRN appears only during the initial visual response, but the modulation of LGN reappears later in the response, suggesting separate early and late sources of attentional modulation in LGN.","[McAlonan, Kerry; Cavanaugh, James; Wurtz, Robert H.] NEI, Sensorimotor Res Lab, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA","McAlonan, K (reprint author), NEI, Sensorimotor Res Lab, NIH, Bldg 10, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA.",km@nei.nih.gov,,,National Eye Institute,"This work was supported by the intramural research program of the National Eye Institute.

They resemble Darwin's 'proto-eyes', considered to be the first eyes to appear in animal evolution(1-4). Eyespots cannot form images but enable the animal to sense the direction of light. They are characteristic for the zooplankton larvae of marine invertebrates and are thought to mediate larval swimming towards the light. Phototaxis of invertebrate larvae contributes to the vertical migration of marine plankton(5), which is thought to represent the biggest biomass transport on Earth(6,7). Yet, despite its ecological and evolutionary importance, the mechanism by which eyespots regulate phototaxis is poorly understood. Here we show how simple eyespots in marine zooplankton mediate phototactic swimming, using the marine annelid Platynereis dumerilii as a model(8). We find that the selective illumination of one eyespot changes the beating of adjacent cilia by direct cholinergic innervation resulting in locally reduced water flow. Computer simulations of larval swimming show that these local effects are sufficient to direct the helical swimming trajectories towards the light. The computer model also shows that axial rotation of the larval body is essential for phototaxis and that helical swimming increases the precision of navigation. These results provide, to our knowledge, the first mechanistic understanding of phototaxis in a marine zooplankton larva and show how simple eyespots regulate it. We propose that the underlying direct coupling of light sensing and ciliary locomotor control was a principal feature of the proto- eye and an important landmark in the evolution of animal eyes.","[Jekely, Gaspar; Guy, Keren; Arendt, Detlev] European Mol Biol Lab, Dev Biol Unit, D-69117 Heidelberg, Germany; [Colombelli, Julien; Stelzer, Ernst; Nedelec, Francois] European Mol Biol Lab, Cell Biol & Biophys Unit, D-69117 Heidelberg, Germany; [Hausen, Harald] Free Univ Berlin, Inst Biol Systemat & Evolut Tiere, D-14195 Berlin, Germany","Jekely, G (reprint author), Max Planck Inst Dev Biol, D-72076 Tubingen, Germany.",gaspar.jekely@tuebingen.mpg.de; arendt@embl.de,"Stelzer, Ernst/A-7648-2011; Nedelec, Francois/H-3317-2011; Jekely, Gaspar/I-8708-2012","Stelzer, Ernst/0000-0003-1545-0736; Jekely, Gaspar/0000-0001-8496-9836","Center for Modelling and Simulation in the Biosciences; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft [HA 4443/1-1, DA Ar387/1-1]; FEBS Long Term Fellowship","We thank K.

At some point after fertilization, control of embryogenesis is transferred to the zygotic genome in a process called the maternal- to-zygotic transition. During this time, many maternal RNAs are degraded and transcription of zygotic RNAs ensues(1). There is a long-standing question as to which factors regulate these events. The recent findings that microRNAs(2,3) and Smaug(4) mediate maternal transcript degradation have shed new light on this aspect of the problem. However, the transcription factor(s) that activate the zygotic genomeremain elusive. The discovery that many of the early transcribed genes in Drosophila share a cis- regulatory heptamer motif, CAGGTAG and related sequences(5,6), collectively referred to as TAGteam sites(5) raised the possibility that a dedicated transcription factor could interact with these sites to activate transcription. Here we report that the zinc- finger protein Zelda ( Zld; Zinc- finger early Drosophila activator) binds specifically to these sites and is capable of activating transcription in transient transfection assays. Mutant embryos lacking zld are defective in cellular blastoderm formation, and fail to activate many genes essential for cellularization, sex determination and pattern formation. Global expression profiling confirmed that Zld has an important role in the activation of the early zygotic genome and suggests that Zld may also regulate maternal RNA degradation during the maternal- to- zygotic transition.","[Liang, Hsiao-Lan; Nien, Chung-Yi; Liu, Hsiao-Yun; Kirov, Nikolai; Rushlow, Christine] NYU, Dept Biol, New York, NY 10003 USA; [Metzstein, Mark M.] Univ Utah, Inst Human Genet, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA","Rushlow, C (reprint author), NYU, Dept Biol, 100 Washington Sq E, New York, NY 10003 USA.",chris.rushlow@nyu.edu,,,National Institutes of Health [GM63024],"We thank the following people for gifts of RNA probes, plasmids, antibodies and fly stocks: J.

Their endogenous inhibitor, calpastatin, consists of four inhibitory repeats, each of which neutralizes an activated calpain with exquisite specificity and potency(6). Despite the physiological importance of this interaction, the structural basis of calpain inhibition by calpastatin is unknown(7). Here we report the 3.0 angstrom structure of Ca(2+)-bound m-calpain in complex with the first calpastatin repeat, both from rat, revealing the mechanism of exclusive specificity. The structure highlights the complexity of calpain activation by Ca(2+) illustrating key residues in a peripheral domain that serve to stabilize the protease core on Ca(2+) binding. Fully activated calpain binds ten Ca(2+) atoms, resulting in several conformational changes allowing recognition by calpastatin. Calpain inhibition is mediated by the intimate contact with three critical regions of calpastatin. Two regions target the penta- EF- hand domains of calpain and the third occupies the substrate- binding cleft, projecting a loop around the active site thiol to evade proteolysis.","[Moldoveanu, Tudor; Green, Douglas R.] St Jude Childrens Hosp, Dept Immunol, Memphis, TN 38105 USA; [Gehring, Kalle] McGill Univ, Dept Biochem, Montreal, PQ H3G 1Y6, Canada","Green, DR (reprint author), St Jude Childrens Hosp, Dept Immunol, 332 N Lauderdale St, Memphis, TN 38105 USA.",douglas.green@stjude.org,"Gehring, Kalle/I-4403-2013","Gehring, Kalle/0000-0001-6500-1184",US National Institute of Health; National Cancer Institute; Canadian Institute of Health Research; American Lebanese Syrian Associated Charities,"We thank P.

In mammals, the two best-characterized members of the calpain family, calpain 1 and calpain 2 ( mu-calpain and m-calpain, respectively), are ubiquitously expressed. The activity of calpains is tightly controlled by the endogenous inhibitor calpastatin, which is an intrinsically unstructured protein capable of reversibly binding and inhibiting four molecules of calpain, but only in the presence of calcium(5,6). To date, the mechanism of inhibition by calpastatin and the basis for its absolute specificity have remained speculative(7-9). It was not clear how this unstructured protein inhibits calpains without being cleaved itself, nor was it known how calcium induced changes that facilitated the binding of calpastatin to calpain. Here we report the 2.4-angstrom-resolution crystal structure of the calcium-bound calpain 2 heterodimer bound by one of the four inhibitory domains of calpastatin. Calpastatin is seen to inhibit calpain by occupying both sides of the active site cleft. Although the inhibitor passes through the active site cleft it escapes cleavage in a novel manner by looping out and around the active site cysteine. The inhibitory domain of calpastatin recognizes multiple lower affinity sites present only in the calcium-bound form of the enzyme, resulting in an interaction that is tight, specific and calcium dependent. This crystal structure, and that of a related complex(10), also reveal the conformational changes that calpain undergoes on binding calcium, which include opening of the active site cleft and movement of the domains relative to each other to produce a more compact enzyme.","[Hanna, Rachel A.; Campbell, Robert L.; Davies, Peter L.] Queens Univ, Dept Biochem, Kingston, ON K7L 3N6, Canada","Davies, PL (reprint author), Queens Univ, Dept Biochem, Kingston, ON K7L 3N6, Canada.",peter.davies@queensu.ca,,"Campbell, Robert/0000-0002-5473-5876",Canadian Institutes for Health Research; Bauman Fellowship; R.

Access to the ion-binding sites within the pumps alternates between the two sides of the membrane(1) to avoid the dissipation of the gradients that would occur during simultaneous access. In Na(+),K(+)-ATPase pumps treated with the marine agent palytoxin, this strict alternation is disrupted and binding sites are sometimes simultaneously accessible from both sides of the membrane, transforming the pumps into ion channels (see, for example, refs 2, 3). Current recordings in these channels can monitor accessibility of introduced cysteine residues to water-soluble sulphydryl-specific reagents(4). We found previously(5) that Na(+),K(+) pump-channels open to the extracellular surface through a deep and wide vestibule that emanates from a narrower pathway between transmembrane helices 4 and 6 (TM4 and TM6). Here we report that cysteine scans from TM1 to TM6 reveal a single unbroken cation pathway that traverses palytoxin-bound Na(+),K(+) pump-channels from one side of the membrane to the other. This pathway comprises residues from TM1, TM2, TM4 and TM6, passes through ion-binding site II,and is probably conserved in structurally and evolutionarily related P-type pumps, such as sarcoplasmic- and endoplasmic-reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPases and H(+),K(+)-ATPases.","[Takeuchi, Ayako; Reyes, Nicolas; Artigas, Pablo; Gadsby, David C.] Rockefeller Univ, Lab Cardiac Membrane Physiol, New York, NY 10065 USA","Gadsby, DC (reprint author), Rockefeller Univ, Lab Cardiac Membrane Physiol, New York, NY 10065 USA.",gadsby@rockefeller.edu,,"Reyes, Nicolas/0000-0001-6618-8307",NIH; Vicente Trust,"We thank N.

Here we address these issues by using temperature to manipulate the biophysical dynamics in different regions of the songbird forebrain involved in song production. We find that cooling the premotor nucleus HVC ( formerly known as the high vocal centre) slows song speed across all timescales by up to 45 per cent but only slightly alters the acoustic structure, whereas cooling the downstream motor nucleus RA ( robust nucleus of the arcopallium) has no observable effect on song timing. Our observations suggest that dynamics within HVC are involved in the control of song timing, perhaps through a chain- like organization. Local manipulation of brain temperature should be broadly applicable to the identification of neural circuitry that controls the timing of behavioural sequences and, more generally, to the study of the origin and role of oscillatory and other forms of brain dynamics in neural systems.","[Long, Michael A.; Fee, Michale S.] MIT, McGovern Inst Brain Res, Dept Brain & Cognit Sci, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA","Fee, MS (reprint author), MIT, McGovern Inst Brain Res, Dept Brain & Cognit Sci, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",fee@mit.edu,,"Fee, Michale/0000-0001-7539-1745","US National Institutes of Health [MH067105, DC009280]; Human Frontiers Science Project","We thank D.

We investigated neurons of the ventral suprachiasmatic nucleus that regulate neuroendocrine pituitary function in response to light in teleosts, amphibia and primates. Here we show that altering light exposure, which changes the sensory input to the circuit controlling adaptation of skin pigmentation to background, changes the number of neurons expressing dopamine in larvae of the amphibian Xenopus laevis in a circuit- specific and activity- dependent manner. Neurons newly expressing dopamine then regulate changes in camouflage colouration in response to illumination.

Our results uncover binding sites for toxins from tarantula and scorpion venom on each of the four paddle motifs in Nav channels, and reveal how paddle- specific interactions can be used to reshape Na(v) channel activity.

At Saturn, these processes collisionally excite hydrogen, causing ultraviolet emission(1-8), and ionize the hydrogen, leading to H-3(+) infrared emission(9-15). Although the morphology of these aurorae is affected by changes in the solar wind(6,11), the source of the currents which produce them is a matter of debate(16,17). Recent models predict only weak emission away from the main auroral oval(18). Here we report images that show emission both poleward and equatorward of the main oval (separated by a region of low emission). The extensive polar emission is highly variable with time, and disappears when the main oval has a spiral morphology; this suggests that although the polar emission may be associated with minor increases in the dynamic pressure from the solar wind, it is not directly linked to strong magnetospheric compressions. This aurora appears to be unique to Saturn and cannot be explained using our current understanding of Saturn's magnetosphere. The equatorward arc of emission exists only on the nightside of the planet, and arises from internal magnetospheric processes that are currently unknown.","[Stallard, Tom; Bunce, Emma J.; Cowley, Stan W.

For qubits based on electron spin, a universal single- qubit gate is realized by a rotation of the spin by any angle about an arbitrary axis. Driven, coherent Rabi oscillations between two spin states can be used to demonstrate control of the rotation angle. Ramsey interference, produced by two coherent spin rotations separated by a variable time delay, demonstrates control over the axis of rotation. Full quantum control of an electron spin in a quantum dot has previously been demonstrated using resonant radio- frequency pulses that require many spin precession periods(7-10). However, optical manipulation of the spin allows quantum control on a picosecond or femtosecond timescale(11-18), permitting an arbitrary rotation to be completed within one spin precession period(6). Recent work in optical single-spin control has demonstrated the initialization of a spin state in a quantumdot(19-22), as well as the ultrafast manipulation of coherence in a largely unpolarized single- spin state(17). Here we demonstrate complete coherent control over an initialized electron spin state in a quantum dot using picosecond optical pulses. First we vary the intensity of a single optical pulse to observe over six Rabi oscillations between the two spin states; then we apply two sequential pulses to observe high- contrast Ramsey interference. Such a two- pulse sequence realizes an arbitrary single- qubit gate completed on a picosecond timescale. Along with the spin initialization and final projective measurement of the spin state, these results demonstrate a complete set of all- optical single- qubit operations.","[Press, David; Ladd, Thaddeus D.; Zhang, Bingyang; Yamamoto, Yoshihisa] Stanford Univ, Edward L Ginzton Lab, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Ladd, Thaddeus D.; Yamamoto, Yoshihisa] Res Org Informat & Syst, Natl Inst Informat, Chiyoda Ku, Tokyo 1018403, Japan","Press, D (reprint author), Stanford Univ, Edward L Ginzton Lab, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",dlpress@stanford.edu,"Ladd, Thaddeus/A-1136-2007; Ladd, Thaddeus/C-5822-2009; Yamamoto, Yoshihisa/A-2811-2012",,"JST/SORST; NICT; MEXT; MURI [(ARMY, DAAD 19-03-1-0199)]; Special Coordination Funds for Promoting Science and Technology","This work was supported by JST/SORST, NICT, MEXT, MURI (ARMY, DAAD 19-03-1-0199) and Special Coordination Funds for Promoting Science and Technology.

They commonly consist of nanometre- size active components ( typically metals or metal oxides) dispersed on a high- surface- area solid support, with performance depending on the catalysts' nanometre- size features and on interactions involving the active components, the support and the reactant and product molecules. To gain insight into the mechanisms of heterogeneous catalysts, which could guide the design of improved or novel catalysts, it is thus necessary to have a detailed characterization of the physicochemical composition of heterogeneous catalysts in their working state at the nanometre scale(1,2). Scanning probe microscopy methods have been used to study inorganic catalyst phases at subnanometre resolution(3-6), but detailed chemical information of the materials in their working state is often difficult to obtain(5-7). By contrast, optical microspectroscopic approaches offer much flexibility for in situ chemical characterization; however, this comes at the expense of limited spatial resolution(8-11). A recent development promising high spatial resolution and chemical characterization capabilities is scanning transmission X- ray microscopy(4,12,13), which has been used in a proof- of- principle study to characterize a solid catalyst(14). Here we show that when adapting a nanoreactor specially designed for high-resolution electron microscopy(7), scanning transmission X- ray microscopy can be used at atmospheric pressure and up to 350 degrees C to monitor in situ phase changes in a complex iron- based Fisher-Tropsch catalyst and the nature and location of carbon species produced. We expect that our system, which is capable of operating up to 500 degrees C, will open new opportunities for nanometre- resolution imaging of a range of important chemical processes taking place on solids in gaseous or liquid environments.","[de Smit, Emiel; Swart, Ingmar; Morin, Cynthia; Weckhuysen, Bert M.; de Groot, Frank M.

About 900 kyr ago, variability increased and oscillated primarily at a period of similar to 100 kyr, suggesting that the link was then with the eccentricity of Earth's orbit. This transition has often(2-5) been attributed to a non-linear response to small changes in external boundary conditions. Here we propose that increasing variablility within the past million years may indicate that the climate system was approaching a second climate bifurcation point, after which it would transition again to a new stable state characterized by permanent mid- latitude Northern Hemisphere glaciation. From this perspective the past million years can be viewed as a transient interval in the evolution of Earth's climate. We support our hypothesis using a coupled energy balance/ ice- sheet model, which furthermore predicts that the future transition would involve a large expansion of the Eurasian ice sheet. The process responsible for the abrupt change seems to be the albedo discontinuity at the snow - ice edge. The best- fit model run, which explains almost 60% of the variance in global ice volume(6) during the past 400 kyr, predicts a rapid transition in the geologically near future to the proposed glacial state. Should it be attained, this state would be more 'symmetric' than the present climate, with comparable areas of ice/ sea- ice cover in each hemisphere, and would represent the culmination of 50 million years of evolution from bipolar nonglacial climates to bipolar glacial climates.","[Crowley, Thomas J.] Univ Edinburgh, Sch Geosci, Edinburgh EH9 3JW, Midlothian, Scotland; [Hyde, William T.] Univ Toronto, Dept Phys, Toronto, ON M5S 1A7, Canada","Crowley, TJ (reprint author), Univ Edinburgh, Sch Geosci, Edinburgh EH9 3JW, Midlothian, Scotland.",thomas.crowley@ed.ac.uk,,,"Scottish Alliance for Geoscience, the Environment, and Society ( SAGES); US National Science Foundation","This research received partial support the Scottish Alliance for Geoscience, the Environment, and Society ( SAGES) and from the US National Science Foundation.

In the deep Earth, iron in silicate perovskite, (Mg(0.9)Fe(0.1))SiO(3), and ferropericlase, (Mg(0.85)Fe(0.15))O, influences the thermal conductivity of the lower mantle and therefore heat flux from the core. Little is known, however, about the effect of iron oxidation states on transport properties. Here we show that the radiative component of thermal conductivity in the dominant silicate perovskite material of Earth's lower mantle is controlled by the amount of ferric iron, Fe(3+). We obtained the optical absorption spectra of silicate perovskite and ferropericlase at pressures up to 133 GPa, corresponding to pressures at the core - mantle boundary. Absorption spectra of ferropericlase up to 800 K and 60 GPa exhibit minimal temperature dependence. The results on silicate perovskite show that optical absorption in the visible and near- infrared spectral range is dominated by O-Fe(3+) charge transfer and Fe(3+)-Fe(2+) intervalence transitions, whereas a contribution from the Fe(2+) crystal- field transitions is substantially smaller. The estimated pressure- dependent radiative conductivity, k(rad), from these data is 2-5 times lower than previously inferred from model extrapolations, with implications for the evolution of the mantle, such as generation and stability of thermo- chemical plumes in the lower mantle.","[Goncharov, Alexander F.; Haugen, Benjamin D.; Struzhkin, Viktor V.; Beck, Pierre] Carnegie Inst Washington, Geophys Lab, Washington, DC 20015 USA; [Haugen, Benjamin D.] Univ Colorado, Dept Geol Sci, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Jacobsen, Steven D.] Northwestern Univ, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, Evanston, IL 60208 USA","Goncharov, AF (reprint author), Carnegie Inst Washington, Geophys Lab, 5251 Broad Branch Rd NW, Washington, DC 20015 USA.",goncharov@gl.ciw.edu,"Beck, Pierre/F-3149-2011; Struzhkin, Viktor/J-9847-2013; Jacobsen, Steven/F-3443-2013","Struzhkin, Viktor/0000-0002-3468-0548; Jacobsen, Steven/0000-0002-9746-958X",NSF/EAR; DOE/BES; DOE/NNSA (CDAC); W.

However, these two interactions are most commonly viewed highly asymmetrically. Competition for resources is seen as the primary interaction limiting diversity, with predation modifying what competition does(1), although theoretical models have long supported diverse views(1-5). Here we show, using a comprehensive three- trophic- level model, that competition and predation should be viewed symmetrically: these two interactions are equally able to either limit or promote diversity. Diversity maintenance requires within- species density feedback loops to be stronger than between- species feedback loops. We quantify the contributions of predation and competition to these loops in a simple, interpretable form, showing their equivalent potential to strengthen or weaken diversity maintenance. Moreover, we show that competition and predation can undermine each other, with the tendency of the stronger interaction to promote or limit diversity prevailing. The past failure to appreciate the symmetrical effects and interactions of competition and predation has unduly restricted diversity maintenance studies. A multitrophic perspective should be adopted to examine a greater variety of possible effects of predation than generally considered in the past. Conservation and management strategies need to be much more concerned with the implications of changes in the strengths of trophic interactions.","[Chesson, Peter; Kuang, Jessica J.] Univ Arizona, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA","Chesson, P (reprint author), Univ Arizona, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA.",pchesson@u.arizona.edu; jjkuang@u.arizona.edu,,,"National Science Foundation [DEB-0542991, DEB-0717222]",This work was supported by National Science Foundation grants DEB-0542991 and DEB-0717222.,,24,142,145,13,148,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,13-Nov,2008,456,7219,,,,,235,238,,10.1038/nature07248,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,374JJ,WOS:000261039300039,19005554,No,,,11/20/17

The genome sequence of the marine centric diatom Thalassiosira pseudonana was recently reported, revealing a wealth of information about diatom biology(3-5). Here we report the complete genome sequence of the pennate diatom Phaeodactylum tricornutum and compare it with that of T. pseudonana to clarify evolutionary origins, functional significance and ubiquity of these features throughout diatoms. In spite of the fact that the pennate and centric lineages have only been diverging for 90 million years, their genome structures are dramatically different and a substantial fraction of genes (similar to 40%) are not shared by these representatives of the two lineages. Analysis of molecular divergence compared with yeasts and metazoans reveals rapid rates of gene diversification in diatoms. Contributing factors include selective gene family expansions, differential losses and gains of genes and introns, and differential mobilization of transposable elements. Most significantly, we document the presence of hundreds of genes from bacteria. More than 300 of these gene transfers are found in both diatoms, attesting to their ancient origins, and many are likely to provide novel possibilities for metabolite management and for perception of environmental signals.

This information may come via personal experiences of reward, but also from the behaviour of social partners(1,2). Social learning is widely held to be distinct from other forms of learning in its mechanism and neural implementation; it is often assumed to compete with simpler mechanisms, such as reward- based associative learning, to drive behaviour(3). Recently, neural signals have been observed during social exchange reminiscent of signals seen in studies of associative learning(4). Here we demonstrate that social information may be acquired using the same associative processes assumed to underlie reward- based learning. We find that key computational variables for learning in the social and reward domains are processed in a similar fashion, but in parallel neural processing streams. Two neighbouring divisions of the anterior cingulate cortex were central to learning about social and reward- based information, and for determining the extent to which each source of information guides behaviour. When making a decision, however, the information learnt using these parallel streams was combined within ventromedial prefrontal cortex. These findings suggest that human social valuation can be realized by means of the same associative processes previously established for learning other, simpler, features of the environment.","[Behrens, Timothy E.

Forty- five million individuals worldwide are bilaterally blind and another 135 million have severely impaired vision in both eyes because of loss of corneal transparency(1); treatments range from local medications to corneal transplants, and more recently to stem cell therapy(2). The corneal epithelium is a squamous epithelium that is constantly renewing, with a vertical turnover of 7 to 14 days in many mammals(3). Identification of slow cycling cells ( label- retaining cells) in the limbus of the mouse has led to the notion that the limbus is the niche for the stem cells responsible for the long- term renewal of the cornea(4); hence, the corneal epithelium is supposedly renewed by cells generated at and migrating from the limbus, in marked opposition to other squamous epithelia in which each resident stem cell has in charge a limited area of epithelium(5,6). Here we show that the corneal epithelium of the mouse can be serially transplanted, is self- maintained and contains oligopotent stem cells with the capacity to generate goblet cells if provided with a conjunctival environment. Furthermore, the entire ocular surface of the pig, including the cornea, contains oligopotent stem cells (holoclones)(7,8) with the capacity to generate individual colonies of corneal and conjunctival cells. Therefore, the limbus is not the only niche for corneal stem cells and corneal renewal is not different from other squamous epithelia. We propose a model that unifies our observations with the literature and explains why the limbal region is enriched in stem cells.","[Majo, Francois; Rochat, Ariane; Nicolas, Michael; Barrandon, Yann] Ecole Polytech Fed Lausanne, Lab Stem Cell Dynam, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland; [Abou Jaoude, Georges] Ecole Polytech Fed Lausanne, Lab Informat & Visualizat, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland; [Majo, Francois; Rochat, Ariane; Nicolas, Michael; Barrandon, Yann] Univ Lausanne Hosp, CHU Vaudois, Dept Expt Surg, CH-1011 Lausanne, Switzerland","Barrandon, Y (reprint author), Ecole Polytech Fed Lausanne, Lab Stem Cell Dynam, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland.",yann.barrandon@epfl.ch,,,Swiss National Science Foundation [3100A0-104160]; EPFL; CHUV; EuroStemCell; Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale (INSERM); Association pour la Recherche contre le Cancer; Association Francaise contre les Myopathies; Federation des Aveugles et Handicapes Visuels de France; INSERM,"We are grateful to F.

These distortions reflect nonlinear mechanical interactions within the cochlea. By allowing one tone to suppress another ( masking effect), they contribute to speech intelligibility(2). Tones can also combine to produce sounds with frequencies not present in the acoustic stimulus(3). These sounds compose the otoacoustic emissions that are extensively used to screen hearing in newborns. Because both cochlear amplification and distortion originate from the outer hair cells - one of the two types of sensory receptor cells - it has been speculated that they stem from a common mechanism. Here we show that the nonlinearity underlying cochlear waveform distortions relies on the presence of stereocilin, a protein defective in a recessive form of human deafness(4). Stereocilin was detected in association with horizontal top connectors(5-7), lateral links that join adjacent stereocilia within the outer hair cell's hair bundle. These links were absent in stereocilin- null mutant mice, which became progressively deaf. At the onset of hearing, however, their cochlear sensitivity and frequency tuning were almost normal, although masking was much reduced and both acoustic and electrical waveform distortions were completely lacking. From this unique functional situation, we conclude that the main source of cochlear waveform distortions is a deflection- dependent hair bundle stiffness resulting from constraints imposed by the horizontal top connectors, and not from the intrinsic nonlinear behaviour of the mechanoelectrical transducer channel.","[Verpy, Elisabeth; Weil, Dominique; Leibovici, Michel; Houdon, Carine; Lefevre, Gaelle M.; Hardelin, Jean-Pierre; Petit, Christine] Inst Pasteur, Unite Genet & Physiol Audit, F-75015 Paris, France; [Verpy, Elisabeth; Weil, Dominique; Leibovici, Michel; Houdon, Carine; Lefevre, Gaelle M.; Hardelin, Jean-Pierre; Petit, Christine] INSERM, UMRS 587, F-75015 Paris, France; [Verpy, Elisabeth; Weil, Dominique; Leibovici, Michel; Houdon, Carine; Lefevre, Gaelle M.; Hardelin, Jean-Pierre; Petit, Christine] Coll France, F-75015 Paris, France; [Verpy, Elisabeth; Weil, Dominique; Leibovici, Michel; Houdon, Carine; Lefevre, Gaelle M.; Hardelin, Jean-Pierre; Petit, Christine] Univ Paris 06, F-75015 Paris, France; [Goodyear, Richard J.; Richardson, Guy P.] Univ Sussex, Sch Life Sci, Brighton BN1 9QG, E Sussex, England; [Hamard, Ghislaine] Inst Cochin Genet Mol, F-75014 Paris, France; [Avan, Paul] Univ Auvergne, Lab Biophys Sensorielle, F-63001 Clermont Ferrand, France","Petit, C (reprint author), Inst Pasteur, Unite Genet & Physiol Audit, F-75015 Paris, France.",everpy@pasteur.fr; cpetit@pasteur.fr,"AVAN, Paul/J-6878-2015","AVAN, Paul/0000-0003-1054-1479; Petit, Christine/0000-0002-9069-002X","European Commission FP6 Integrated Project EuroHear,; Fondation Raymonde et Guy Strittmatter; Region Ile-de-France (Programme Sesame); Wellcome Trust","We thank M.

One Crohn's disease risk allele is in ATG16L1, a gene homologous to the essential yeast autophagy gene ATG16 ( ref. 2). It is not known how ATG16L1 or autophagy contributes to intestinal biology or Crohn's disease pathogenesis. To address these questions, we generated and characterized mice that are hypomorphic for ATG16L1 protein expression, and validated conclusions on the basis of studies in these mice by analysing intestinal tissues that we collected from Crohn's disease patients carrying the Crohn's disease risk allele of ATG16L1. Here we show that ATG16L1 is a bona fide autophagy protein. Within the ileal epithelium, both ATG16L1 and a second essential autophagy protein ATG5 are selectively important for the biology of the Paneth cell, a specialized epithelial cell that functions in part by secretion of granule contents containing antimicrobial peptides and other proteins that alter the intestinal environment(3). ATG16L1- andATG5- deficient Paneth cells exhibited notable abnormalities in the granule exocytosis pathway. In addition, transcriptional analysis revealed an unexpected gain of function specific to ATG16L1- deficient Paneth cells including increased expression of genes involved in peroxisome proliferator- activated receptor ( PPAR) signalling and lipid metabolism, of acute phase reactants and of two adipocytokines, leptin and adiponectin, known to directly influence intestinal injury responses. Importantly, Crohn's disease patients homozygous for the ATG16L1 Crohn's disease risk allele displayed Paneth cell granule abnormalities similar to those observed in autophagy- protein- deficient mice and expressed increased levels of leptin protein. Thus, ATG16L1, and probably the process of autophagy, have a role within the intestinal epithelium of mice and Crohn's disease patients by selective effects on the cell biology and specialized regulatory properties of Paneth cells.","[Cadwell, Ken; Liu, John Y.; Brown, Sarah L.; Miyoshi, Hiroyuki; Loh, Joy; Lennerz, Jochen K.; Kc, Wumesh; Carrero, Javier A.; Brunt, Elizabeth M.; Sleckman, Barry P.; Stappenbeck, Thaddeus S.; Virgin, Herbert W.] Washington Univ, Sch Med, Dept Pathol & Immunol, St Louis, MO 63110 USA; [Hunt, Steven] Washington Univ, Sch Med, Dept Surg, St Louis, MO 63110 USA; [Stone, Christian D.; Li, Ellen] Washington Univ, Sch Med, Dept Med, St Louis, MO 63110 USA; [Virgin, Herbert W.] Washington Univ, Sch Med, Dept Mol Microbiol, St Louis, MO 63110 USA; [Kishi, Chieko; Mizushima, Noboru] Tokyo Med & Dent Univ, Grad Sch, Dept Physiol & Cell Biol, Tokyo 1138519, Japan; [Kishi, Chieko; Mizushima, Noboru] Tokyo Med & Dent Univ, Fac Med, Dept Physiol & Cell Biol, Tokyo 1138519, Japan; [Xavier, Ramnik J.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Ctr Computat & Integrat Biol, Boston, MA 02114 USA; [Xavier, Ramnik J.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Gastrointestinal Unit, Boston, MA 02114 USA","Virgin, HW (reprint author), Washington Univ, Sch Med, Dept Pathol & Immunol, St Louis, MO 63110 USA.",stappenb@wustl.edu; virgin@wustl.edu,"Mizushima, Noboru/C-3635-2009","Mizushima, Noboru/0000-0002-6258-6444; Cadwell, Ken/0000-0002-5860-0661","Broad Foundation; NIH [T32 AR07279, R01 AI062832, AI062773, DK43351]; Lallage Feazel Wall Fellowship [DRG-1972-08]; Damon Runyon Cancer Research Foundation; Pew Foundation; Washington University Digestive Diseases Research Core Center [P30 DK52574]; Barnes Jewish Foundation; Johnson and Johnson Translational Seed Award; Crohn's Colitis Foundation of America; Scientific Research from the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology of Japan; Toray Science Foundation;  [U54 AI057160 Project 6]","We thank N.

Autophagy, a bulk degradation system that delivers cytoplasmic constituents into autolysosomes, controls degradation of long- lived proteins, insoluble protein aggregates and invading microbes, and is suggested to be involved in the regulation of inflammation(3-5). However, the mechanism underlying the regulation of inflammatory response by autophagy is poorly understood. Here we show that Atg16L1 ( autophagy-related 16-like 1), which is implicated in Crohn's disease(6,7), regulates endotoxin- induced inflammasome activation in mice. Atg16L1- deficiency disrupts the recruitment of the Atg12-Atg5 conjugate to the isolation membrane, resulting in a loss of microtubule- associated protein 1 light chain 3 ( LC3) conjugation to phosphatidylethanolamine. Consequently, both autophagosome formation and degradation of long- lived proteins are severely impaired in Atg16L1- deficient cells. Following stimulation with lipopolysaccharide, a ligand for Toll- like receptor 4 ( refs 8, 9), Atg16L1- deficient macrophages produce high amounts of the inflammatory cytokines IL-1 beta and IL-18. In lipopolysaccharide-stimulated macrophages, Atg16L1- deficiency causes Toll/IL-1 receptor domain-containing adaptor inducing IFN-beta ( TRIF)dependent activation of caspase- 1, leading to increased production of IL-1 beta. Mice lacking Atg16L1 in haematopoietic cells are highly susceptible to dextran sulphate sodium- induced acute colitis, which is alleviated by injection of anti-IL-1 beta and IL-18 antibodies, indicating the importance of Atg16L1 in the suppression of intestinal inflammation. These results demonstrate that Atg16L1 is an essential component of the autophagic machinery responsible for control of the endotoxin- induced inflammatory immune response.","[Saitoh, Tatsuya; Uematsu, Satoshi; Yang, Bo-Gie; Satoh, Takashi; Kawai, Taro; Takeuchi, Osamu; Akira, Shizuo] Osaka Univ, WPI Immunol Frontier Res Ctr, Host Def Lab, Suita, Osaka 5650871, Japan; [Jang, Myoung Ho] Osaka Univ, WPI Immunol Frontier Res Ctr, Lab Gastrointestinal Immunol, Suita, Osaka 5650871, Japan; [Saitoh, Tatsuya; Uematsu, Satoshi; Yang, Bo-Gie; Satoh, Takashi; Kawai, Taro; Takeuchi, Osamu; Akira, Shizuo] Osaka Univ, Res Inst Microbial Dis, Dept Host Def, Suita, Osaka 5650871, Japan; [Fujita, Naonobu; Omori, Hiroko; Noda, Takeshi; Yoshimori, Tamotsu] Osaka Univ, Res Inst Microbial Dis, Dept Cellular Regulat, Suita, Osaka 5650871, Japan; [Yamamoto, Naoki] Natl Inst Infect Dis, AIDS Res Ctr, Shinjuku Ku, Tokyo 1628640, Japan; [Komatsu, Masaaki; Tanaka, Keiji] Tokyo Metropolitan Inst Med Sci, Lab Frontier Sci, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo 1138613, Japan; [Komatsu, Masaaki] Juntendo Univ, Sch Med, Dept Biochem, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo 1138421, Japan; [Komatsu, Masaaki] Japan Sci & Technol Corp, PRESTO, Kawaguchi, Saitama 3320012, Japan; [Tsujimura, Tohru] Hyogo Med Univ, Dept Pathol, Nishinomiya, Hyogo 6638501, Japan; [Yoshimori, Tamotsu] Japan Sci & Technol Agcy, CREST, Kawaguchi, Saitama 3320012, Japan","Akira, S (reprint author), Osaka Univ, WPI Immunol Frontier Res Ctr, Host Def Lab, 3-1 Yamadaoka, Suita, Osaka 5650871, Japan.",akira@biken.osaka-u.ac.jp,"Akira, Shizuo/C-3134-2009; Jang, Myoung Ho/D-1714-2009; Noda, Takeshi/B-7240-2008; Takeuchi, Osamu/D-6007-2011; surname, name/A-2183-2010","Jang, Myoung Ho/0000-0001-8909-4725; Noda, Takeshi/0000-0003-3581-7961; ","NIH [AI070167]; Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare of Japan; Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology of Japan.","We are grateful to T.

Hepatic glucose output diminishes during the late protein- sparing phase of fasting, when ketone body production by the liver supplies compensatory fuel for glucose- dependent tissues(1-4). Glucagon stimulates the gluconeogenic program by triggering the dephosphorylation and nuclear translocation of the CREB regulated transcription coactivator 2 ( CRTC2; also known as TORC2), while parallel decreases in insulin signalling augment gluconeogenic gene expression through the dephosphorylation and nuclear shuttling of forkhead box O1 (FOXO1)(5-7). Here we show that a fasting- inducible switch, consisting of the histone acetyltransferase p300 and the nutrient- sensing deacetylase sirtuin 1 ( SIRT1), maintains energy balance in mice through the sequential induction of CRTC2 and FOXO1. After glucagon induction, CRTC2 stimulated gluconeogenic gene expression by an association with p300, which we show here is also activated by dephosphorylation at Ser 89 during fasting. In turn, p300 increased hepatic CRTC2 activity by acetylating it at Lys 628, a site that also targets CRTC2 for degradation after its ubiquitination by the E3 ligase constitutive photomorphogenic protein (COP1)(8). Glucagon effects were attenuated during late fasting, when CRTC2 was downregulated owing to SIRT1- mediated deacetylation and when FOXO1 supported expression of the gluconeogenic program. Disrupting SIRT1 activity, by liver- specific knockout of the Sirt1 gene or by administration of a SIRT1 antagonist, increased CRTC2 activity and glucose output, whereas exposure to SIRT1 agonists reduced them. In view of the reciprocal activation of FOXO1 and its coactivator peroxisome proliferator- activated receptor-gamma coactivator-1 alpha (PGC-1 alpha, encoded by Ppargc1 alpha) by SIRT1 activators(9-12), our results illustrate how the exchange of two gluconeogenic regulators during fasting maintains energy balance.","[Liu, Yi; Dentin, Renaud; Hedrick, Susan; Ravnskjaer, Kim; Montminy, Marc] Salk Inst Biol Studies, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; [Chen, Danica; Guarente, Leonard] MIT, Dept Biol, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Schenk, Simon; Olefsky, Jerrold] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Med, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Milne, Jill] Sirtris Pharmaceut Inc, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Meyers, David J.; Cole, Phil] Johns Hopkins Univ, Sch Med, Dept Pharmacol & Mol Sci, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA; [Yates, John, III] Scripps Res Inst, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA","Montminy, M (reprint author), Salk Inst Biol Studies, 10010 N Torrey Pines Rd, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA.",Montminy@salk.edu,"dentin, Renaud/P-4939-2017","Schenk, Simon/0000-0002-8224-3203","National Institutes of Health; Clayton Medical Research Foundation, Inc; Hillblom Foundation; Kieckhefer Foundation","We thank M.

Sequencing projects have traditionally used long ( 400 - 800 base pair) reads, but the existence of reference sequences for the human and many other genomes makes it possible to develop new, fast approaches to re- sequencing, whereby shorter reads are compared to a reference to identify intraspecies genetic variation. Here we report an approach that generates several billion bases of accurate nucleotide sequence per experiment at low cost. Single molecules of DNA are attached to a flat surface, amplified in situ and used as templates for synthetic sequencing with fluorescent reversible terminator deoxyribonucleotides. Images of the surface are analysed to generate high- quality sequence. We demonstrate application of this approach to human genome sequencing on flow- sorted X chromosomes and then scale the approach to determine the genome sequence of a male Yoruba from Ibadan, Nigeria. We build an accurate consensus sequence from. 303 average depth of paired 35- base reads. We characterize four million single- nucleotide polymorphisms and four hundred thousand structural variants, many of which were previously unknown. Our approach is effective for accurate, rapid and economical whole- genome re- sequencing and many other biomedical applications.","[Bentley, David R.; Swerdlow, Harold P.; Smith, Geoffrey P.; Milton, John; Brown, Clive G.; Hall, Kevin P.; Evers, Dirk J.; Barnes, Colin L.; Bignell, Helen R.; Boutell, Jonathan M.; Bryant, Jason; Carter, Richard J.; Cheetham, R.

The genome was sequenced to 36- fold average coverage using massively parallel sequencing technology. We aligned the short reads onto the NCBI human reference genome to 99.97% coverage, and guided by the reference genome, we used uniquely mapped reads to assemble a high- quality consensus sequence for 92% of the Asian individual's genome. We identified approximately 3 million single- nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs) inside this region, of which 13.6% were not in the dbSNP database. Genotyping analysis showed that SNP identification had high accuracy and consistency, indicating the high sequence quality of this assembly.

Here we present the results obtained from sequencing a typical acute myeloid leukaemia genome, and its matched normal counterpart obtained from the same patient's skin. We discovered ten genes with acquired mutations; two were previously described mutations that are thought to contribute to tumour progression, and eight were new mutations present in virtually all tumour cells at presentation and relapse, the function of which is not yet known.

It is plausibly an elementary particle, perhaps the lightest supersymmetric partner of known particle species(1). In this case, annihilation of dark matter in the halo of the Milky Way should produce gamma-rays at a level that may soon be observable(2,3). Previous work has argued that the annihilation signal will be dominated by emission from very small clumps(4,5) ( perhaps smaller even than the Earth), which would be most easily detected where they cluster together in the dark matter haloes of dwarf satellite galaxies(6). Here we report that such small- scale structure will, in fact, have a negligible impact on dark matter detectability. Rather, the dominant and probably most easily detectable signal will be produced by diffuse dark matter in the main halo of the MilkyWay(7,8). If the main halo is strongly detected, then small dark matter clumps should also be visible, but may well contain no stars, thereby confirming a key prediction of the cold dark matter model.","[Springel, V.; White, S.

At temperatures considerably above those associated with superconductivity, the high- transition- temperature copper oxides have an additional 'pseudogap'. It has been unclear whether this represents preformed pairs of electrons that have not achieved the coherence necessary for superconductivity, or whether it reflects some alternative ground state that competes with superconductivity(1). Paired electrons should display particle - hole symmetry with respect to the Fermi level (the energy of the highest occupied level in the electronic system), but competing states(2-4) need not show such symmetry. Here we report a photoemission study of the underdoped copper oxide Bi(2)Sr(2)CaCu(2)O(8+delta) that shows the opening of a symmetric gap only in the anti-nodal region, contrary to the expectation that pairing would take place in the nodal region. It is therefore evident that the pseudogap does reflect the formation of preformed pairs of electrons and that the pairing occurs only in well- defined directions of the underlying lattice.","[Yang, H. -B.; Rameau, J.

State- of- the- art oscilloscopes with high- speed photodetectors provide single- shot waveform measurement with 30- ps resolution. Although multiple- shot sampling techniques can achieve few- picosecond resolution, single- shot measurements are necessary to analyse events that are rapidly varying in time, asynchronous, or may occur only once. Further improvements in single- shot resolution are challenging, owing to microelectronic bandwidth limitations. To overcome these limitations, researchers have looked towards all- optical techniques because of the large processing bandwidths that photonics allow. This has generated an explosion of interest in the integration of photonics on standard electronics platforms, which has spawned the field of silicon photonics(2) and promises to enable the next generation of computer processing units and advances in high- bandwidth communications. For the success of silicon photonics in these areas, on- chip optical signal- processing for optical performance monitoring will prove critical. Beyond next- generation communications, siliconcompatible ultrafast metrology would be of great utility to many fundamental research fields, as evident from the scientific impact that ultrafast measurement techniques continue to make(3-5). Here, using time- to- frequency conversion(6) via the nonlinear process of four- wave mixing on a silicon chip, we demonstrate a waveform measurement technology within a silicon- photonic platform. We measure optical waveforms with 220- fs resolution over lengths greater than 100 ps, which represent the largest record- length- to-resolution ratio (> 450) of any single- shot- capable picosecond waveform measurement technique(6-16). Our implementation allows for single- shot measurements and uses only highly developed electronic and optical materials of complementary metal- oxide-semiconductor (CMOS)- compatible silicon- on- insulator technology and single- mode optical fibre. The mature silicon- on- insulator platform and the ability to integrate electronics with these CMOS-compatible photonics offer great promise to extend this technology into commonplace bench- top and chip- scale instruments.","[Foster, Mark A.; Salem, Reza; Geraghty, David F.; Gaeta, Alexander L.] Cornell Univ, Sch Appl & Engn Phys, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Turner-Foster, Amy C.; Lipson, Michal] Cornell Univ, Sch Elect & Comp Engn, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA","Gaeta, AL (reprint author), Cornell Univ, Sch Appl & Engn Phys, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",a.gaeta@cornell.edu,"Foster, Amy/E-8009-2010; Foster, Mark/E-8011-2010","Foster, Mark/0000-0002-4524-141X","DARPA; NSF; New York State Office of Science, Technology and Academic Research","This work was supported by DARPA through the optical arbitrary waveform generation programme and by the Center for Nanoscale Systems, supported by the NSF and the New York State Office of Science, Technology and Academic Research.",,30,242,245,6,61,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,6-Nov,2008,456,7218,,,,,81,U2,,10.1038/nature07430,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,369DH,WOS:000260674000044,18987739,No,,,11/20/17

On the basis of a comparison of 20 climate variables over the past four glacial cycles, the SPECMAP project(1) proposed that summer insolation at high northern latitudes ( that is, Milankovitch forcing) drives the same sequence of ocean circulation and other climate responses over 100- kyr eccentricity cycles, 41- kyr obliquity cycles and 23- kyr precession cycles. SPECMAP analysed the circulation response at only a few sites in the Atlantic Ocean, however, and the phase of circulation response has been shown to vary by site and orbital band(2). Here we test the SPECMAP hypothesis by measuring the phase of orbital responses in benthic delta C-13 ( a proxy indicator of ocean nutrient content) at 24 sites throughout the Atlantic over the past 425 kyr. On the basis of delta C-13 responses at 3,000 - 4,010 mwater depth, we find that maxima in Milankovitch forcing are associated with greater mid- depth overturning in the obliquity band but less overturning in the precession band. This suggests that Atlantic overturning is strongly sensitive to factors beyond ice volume and summer insolation at high northern latitudes. A better understanding of these processes could lead to improvements in model estimates of overturning rates, which range from a 40 per cent increase to a 40 per cent decrease at the Last Glacial Maximum(3) and a 10 - 50 per cent decrease over the next 140 yr in response to projected increases in atmospheric CO2 ( ref. 4).","[Lisiecki, Lorraine E.; Raymo, Maureen E.] Boston Univ, Dept Earth Sci, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Curry, William B.] Woods Hole Oceanog Inst, Dept Geol & Geophys, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA","Lisiecki, LE (reprint author), Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Earth Sci, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA.",lisiecki@alumni.brown.edu,"Lisiecki, Lorraine/C-4066-2008",,NOAA Postdoctoral Program in Climate and Global Change; NSF,"We thank T.

For most elements this depletion is thought to be a solar nebular signature, as chondrites show depletions qualitatively similar to that of the Earth(1). Onthe other hand, as lead is a volatile element, some Pb may also have been lost after accretion. The unique (206)Pb/(204)Pb and (207)Pb/(204)Pb ratios of the Earth's mantle suggest that some lead was lost about 50 to 130 Myr after Solar System formation(2-4). This has commonly been explained by lead lost via the segregation of a sulphide melt to the Earth's core(5-7), which assumes that lead has an affinity towards sulphide. Some models, however, have reconciled the Earth's lead deficit with volatilization(8). Which ever model is preferred, the broad coincidence of U-Pb model ages with the age of the Moon(9-11) suggests that lead loss may be related to the Moon- forming impact. Here we report partitioning experiments in metal - sulphide - silicate systems. We show that lead is neither siderophile nor chalcophile enough to explain the high U/Pb ratio of the Earth'smantle as being a result of lead pumping to the core. The Earth may have accreted from initially volatile- depleted material, some lead may have been lost to degassing following the Moon- forming giant impact, or a hidden reservoir exists in the deep mantle with lead isotope compositions complementary to upper- mantle values; it is unlikely though that the missing lead resides in the core.","[Lagos, M.; Ballhaus, C.; Muenker, C.; Wohlgemuth-Ueberwasser, C.] Univ Bonn, Steinmann Inst, D-53115 Bonn, Germany; [Lagos, M.; Muenker, C.; Wohlgemuth-Ueberwasser, C.; Berndt, J.] Univ Munster, Inst Mineral, D-48149 Munster, Germany; [Kuzmin, Dmitry V.] Max Planck Inst Chem, Abt Geochem, D-55128 Mainz, Germany; [Kuzmin, Dmitry V.] Russian Acad Sci, SB, Inst Geol & Mineral, Novosibirsk 630090, Russia","Lagos, M (reprint author), Univ Bonn, Steinmann Inst, Poppelsdorfer Schloss, D-53115 Bonn, Germany.",lagos@uni-bonn.de,"Kuzmin, Dmitry/A-3809-2014; Munker, Carsten/O-7606-2015; Wohlgemuth-Ueberwasser, Cora/L-8759-2016","Wohlgemuth-Ueberwasser, Cora/0000-0003-2263-3899",German Research Council,"The paper benefited from our discussions with F.

Climate change is known to be able to drive animal population dynamics between stable and cyclic phases(4,5), and has been suggested to cause the recent changes in cyclic dynamics of rodents and their predators(3,6-9). But although predator - rodent interactions are commonly argued to be the cause of the Fennoscandian rodent cycles(1,10-13), the role of the environment in the modulation of such dynamics is often poorly understood in natural systems(8,9,14). Hence, quantitative links between climate-driven processes and rodent dynamics have so far been lacking. Here we show that winter weather and snow conditions, together with density dependence in the net population growth rate, account for the observed population dynamics of the rodent community dominated by lemmings ( Lemmus lemmus) in an alpine Norwegian core habitat between 1970 and 1997, and predict the observed absence of rodent peak years after 1994. These local rodent dynamics are coherent with alpine bird dynamics both locally and over all of southern Norway, consistent with the influence of large- scale fluctuations in winter conditions. The relationship between commonly available meteorological data and snow conditions indicates that changes in temperature and humidity, and thus conditions in the subnivean space, seem to markedly affect the dynamics of alpine rodents and their linked groups. The pattern of less regular rodent peaks, and corresponding changes in the overall dynamics of the alpine ecosystem, thus seems likely to prevail over a growing area under projected climate change.","[Kausrud, Kyrre L.; Mysterud, Atle; Vik, Jon Olav; Eikeset, Anne Maria; Stenseth, Nils Chr.] Univ Oslo, Ctr Ecol & Evolutionary Synth, N-0316 Oslo, Norway; [Steen, Harald; Ostbye, Eivind; Mysterud, Ivar] Univ Oslo, Dept Biol, N-0316 Oslo, Norway; [Cazelles, Bernard] Ecole Normale Super, CNRS, UMR 7625, F-75230 Paris, France; [Cazelles, Bernard] IRD GEODES, F-93142 Bondy, France; [Framstad, Erik] Norwegian Inst Nat Res, N-0349 Oslo, Norway; [Solhoy, Torstein] Univ Bergen, Dept Biol, N-5007 Bergen, Norway","Stenseth, NC (reprint author), Univ Oslo, Ctr Ecol & Evolutionary Synth, POB 1066 Blindern, N-0316 Oslo, Norway.",n.c.stenseth@bio.uio.no,"; Vik, Jon Olav/B-9350-2008; Stenseth, Nils Chr./G-5212-2016; Cazelles, Bernard/B-1572-2013","Mysterud, Atle/0000-0001-8993-7382; Vik, Jon Olav/0000-0002-7778-4515; Stenseth, Nils Chr./0000-0002-1591-5399; Cazelles, Bernard/0000-0002-7972-361X","Norwegian Institute for Nature Research; University of Oslo; Nansen Fund; Research Council of Norway; Centre for Ecological and Evolutionary Synthesis, Oslo.","E.

Advances in high- throughput genotyping technology have markedly improved our understanding of global patterns of human genetic variation and suggest the potential to use large samples to uncover variation among closely spaced populations(1-5). Here we characterize genetic variation in a sample of 3,000 European individuals genotyped at over half a million variable DNA sites in the human genome. Despite low average levels of genetic differentiation among Europeans, we find a close correspondence between genetic and geographic distances; indeed, a geographical map of Europe arises naturally as an efficient two-dimensional summary of genetic variation in Europeans. The results emphasize that when mapping the genetic basis of a disease phenotype, spurious associations can arise if genetic structure is not properly accounted for. In addition, the results are relevant to the prospects of genetic ancestry testing(6); an individual's DNA can be used to infer their geographic origin with surprising accuracy often to within a few hundred kilometres.","[Novembre, John] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Interdept Program Bioinformat, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Novembre, John; Stephens, Matthew] Univ Chicago, Dept Human Genet, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Stephens, Matthew] Univ Chicago, Dept Stat, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Johnson, Toby; Kutalik, Zoltan; Bergmann, Sven] Univ Lausanne, CHUV, Dept Med Genet, CH-1005 Lausanne, Switzerland; [Johnson, Toby] Univ Lausanne, CHUV, Univ Inst Social & Preventat Med, CH-1005 Lausanne, Switzerland; [Johnson, Toby; Kutalik, Zoltan; Bergmann, Sven] Swiss Inst Bioinformat, Cent Adm, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland; [Bryc, Katarzyna; Boyko, Adam R.; Auton, Adam; Indap, Amit; Bustamante, Carlos D.] Cornell Univ, Dept Biol Stat & Computat Biol, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [King, Karen S.; Nelson, Matthew R.] GlaxoSmithKline Inc, Res Triangle Pk, NC 27709 USA","Novembre, J (reprint author), Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Interdept Program Bioinformat, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.",jnovembre@ucla.edu,"Auton, Adam/B-1159-2009; Novembre, John/G-1339-2011; Colaus, PsyColaus/K-6607-2013","Johnson, Toby/0000-0002-5998-3270; Bergmann, Sven/0000-0002-6785-9034",Giorgi-Cavaglieri Foundation; Swiss National Science Foundation; US National Science Foundation Postdoctoral Fellowship in Bioinformatics; US National Institutes of Health; GlaxoSmithKline,"We thank J.

Neural circuit mechanisms based on neuronal and synaptic properties have been shown to process temporal information over the range of tens of microseconds to hundreds of milliseconds(5-7). How neural circuits process temporal information in the range of seconds to minutes is much less understood. Studies of working memory in monkeys and rats have shown that neurons in the prefrontal cortex(8-10), the parietal cortex(9,11) and the thalamus(12) exhibit ramping activities that linearly correlate with the lapse of time until the end of a specific time interval of several seconds that the animal is trained to memorize. Many organisms can also memorize the time interval of rhythmic sensory stimuli in the timescale of seconds and can coordinate motor behaviour accordingly, for example, by keeping the rhythm after exposure to the beat of music. Here we report a form of rhythmic activity among specific neuronal ensembles in the zebrafish optic tectum, which retains the memory of the time interval ( in the order of seconds) of repetitive sensory stimuli for a duration of up to similar to 20 s. After repetitive visual conditioning stimulation ( CS) of zebrafish larvae, we observed rhythmic post-CS activities among specific tectal neuronal ensembles, with a regular interval that closely matched the CS. Visuomotor behaviour of the zebrafish larvae also showed regular post- CS repetitions at the entrained time interval that correlated with rhythmic neuronal ensemble activities in the tectum. Thus, rhythmic activities among specific neuronal ensembles may act as an adjustable 'metronome' for time intervals in the order of seconds, and serve as a mechanism for the short- term perceptual memory of rhythmic sensory experience.","[Sumbre, German; Poo, Mu-ming] Univ Calif Berkeley, Helen Wills Neurosci Inst, Dept Mol & Cell Biol, Div Neurobiol, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Muto, Akira; Baier, Herwig] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Physiol, San Francisco, CA 94158 USA","Poo, MM (reprint author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Helen Wills Neurosci Inst, Dept Mol & Cell Biol, Div Neurobiol, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",mpoo@berkeley.edu,"Sumbre, German/K-7538-2017","Sumbre, German/0000-0003-4436-6840; Muto, Akira/0000-0003-4276-1775",US National Institutes of Health,"We thank A.

The cells of xeroderma pigmentosum patients are defective in nucleotide excision repair, limiting their capacity to eliminate ultraviolet- induced DNA damage, and resulting in a strong predisposition to develop skin cancers(1). The use of rare cutting DNA endonucleases - such as homing endonucleases, also known as meganucleases - constitutes one possible strategy for repairing DNA lesions. Homing endonucleases have emerged as highly specific molecular scalpels that recognize and cleave DNA sites, promoting efficient homologous gene targeting through double- strand- break- induced homologous recombination. Here we describe two engineered heterodimeric derivatives of the homing endonuclease I- CreI, produced by a semi- rational approach. These two molecules - Amel3 - Amel4 and Ini3 - Ini4 cleave DNA from the human XPC gene ( xeroderma pigmentosum group C), in vitro and in vivo. Crystal structures of the I- CreI variants complexed with intact and cleaved XPC target DNA suggest that the mechanism of DNA recognition and cleavage by the engineered homing endonucleases is similar to that of the wild- type I- CreI. Furthermore, these derivatives induced high levels of specific gene targeting in mammalian cells while displaying no obvious genotoxicity. Thus, homing endonucleases can be designed to recognize and cleave the DNA sequences of specific genes, opening up new possibilities for genome engineering and gene therapy in xeroderma pigmentosum patients whose illness can be treated ex vivo.","[Redondo, Pilar; Munoz, Ines G.; Montoya, Guillermo] Spanish Natl Canc Res Ctr CNIO, Struct Biol & Biocomp Programme, Macromol Crystallog Grp, Madrid 28029, Spain; [Prieto, Jesus; Blanco, Francisco J.] Spanish Natl Canc Res Ctr CNIO, Struct Biol & Biocomp Programme, NMR Grp, Madrid 28029, Spain; [Alibes, Andreu; Stricher, Francois; Serrano, Luis] UPF, European Mol Biol Lab, CRG Syst Biol Unit, CRG, Barcelona 08003, Spain; [Serrano, Luis] ICREA, F-93235 Romainville, France; [Cabaniols, Jean-Pierre; Daboussi, Fayza; Arnould, Sylvain; Perez, Christophe; Duchateau, Philippe; Paques, Frederic] CELLECTIS SA, F-93235 Romainville, France","Blanco, FJ (reprint author), CIC bioGUNE, Parque Tecnol Vizcaya,Edificio 800, Derio 48160, Spain.",fblanco@cicbiogune.es; gmontoya@cnio.es,"Alibes, Andreu/A-5790-2008; Blanco, Francisco/D-4401-2009; Redondo, Pilar/L-7612-2014; Serrano, Luis/B-3355-2013; Munoz, Ines/M-3285-2014","Alibes, Andreu/0000-0002-0055-3014; Blanco, Francisco/0000-0003-2545-4319; Redondo, Pilar/0000-0002-6723-0818; Serrano, Luis/0000-0002-5276-1392; Munoz, Ines/0000-0001-6732-4059",EU MEGATOOL [LSHG-CT-2006-037226]; CRG-Novartis fellowship,We would like to thank J.

This approach is commonly used with genetically tractable organisms. However, the current lack of tools for targeted gene disruptions in obligate intracellular microbial pathogens seriously hampers the identification of their virulence factors. Here we demonstrate an approach to studying potential virulence factors of genetically intractable organisms, such as Chlamydia. Heterologous expression of Chlamydia pneumoniae CopN in yeast and mammalian cells resulted in a cell cycle arrest, presumably owing to alterations in the microtubule cytoskeleton. A screen of a small molecule library identified two compounds that alleviated CopN-induced growth inhibition in yeast. These compounds interfered with C. pneumoniae replication in mammalian cells, presumably by 'knocking out' CopN function, revealing an essential role of CopN in the support of C. pneumoniae growth during infection. This work demonstrates the role of a specific chlamydial protein in virulence. The chemical biology approach described here can be used to identify virulence factors, and the reverse chemical genetic strategy can result in the identification of lead compounds for the development of novel therapeutics.","[Huang, Jin; Lesser, Cammie F.; Lory, Stephen] Harvard Univ, Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Sch Med, Dept Microbiol & Mol Genet, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Lesser, Cammie F.] Harvard Univ, Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Sch Med, Div Infect Dis, Boston, MA 02115 USA","Lory, S (reprint author), Harvard Univ, Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Sch Med, Dept Microbiol & Mol Genet, Boston, MA 02115 USA.",stephen_lory@hms.harvard.edu,,,"NIAID NIH HHS [R01 AI064285, R01 AI064285-03]",,,38,39,39,0,3,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,6-Nov,2008,456,7218,,,,,112,U10,,10.1038/nature07355,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,369DH,WOS:000260674000051,18830244,No,,,11/20/17

RNA interference screening approaches identified two proteins, Stim(1,2) and Orai(3-5), that together form the molecular basis for CRAC channel activity(6,7). Stim senses depletion of the ER Ca(2+) store and physically relays this information by translocating from the ER to junctions adjacent to the plasma membrane(1,8,9), and Orai embodies the pore of the plasma membrane calcium channel(10-12). A close interaction between Stim and Orai, identified by co-immunoprecipitation(12) and by Forster resonance energy transfer(13), is involved in the opening of the Ca(2+) channel formed by Orai subunits. Most ion channels are multimers of pore- forming subunits surrounding a central channel, which are preassembled in the ER and transported in their final stoichiometry to the plasma membrane. Here we show, by biochemical analysis after cross- linking in cell lysates and intact cells and by using non- denaturing gel electrophoresis without cross- linking, that Orai is predominantly a dimer in the plasma membrane under resting conditions. Moreover, single- molecule imaging of green fluorescent protein (GFP)- tagged Orai expressed in Xenopus oocytes showed predominantly two- step photobleaching, again consistent with a dimeric basal state. In contrast, co- expression of GFP- tagged Orai with the carboxy terminus of Stim as a cytosolic protein to activate the Orai channel without inducing Ca(2+) store depletion or clustering of Orai into punctae yielded mostly four- step photobleaching, consistent with a tetrameric stoichiometry of the active Orai channel. Interaction with the C terminus of Stim thus induces Orai dimers to dimerize, forming tetramers that constitute the Ca(2+)-selective pore. This represents a new mechanism in which assembly and activation of the functional ion channel are mediated by the same triggering molecule.","[Penna, Aubin; Yeromin, Andriy V.; Zhang, Shenyuan L.; Safrina, Olga; Parker, Ian; Cahalan, Michael D.] Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Physiol & Biophys, Irvine, CA 92697 USA; [Demuro, Angelo; Parker, Ian] Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Neurobiol & Behav, Irvine, CA 92697 USA; [Cahalan, Michael D.] Univ Calif Irvine, Ctr Immunol, Irvine, CA 92697 USA","Cahalan, MD (reprint author), Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Physiol & Biophys, Irvine, CA 92697 USA.",mcahalan@uci.edu,,"Penna, Maria Pietronilla/0000-0002-0982-3893",National Institutes of Health; George E.

The APOBEC3G-CD2 structure has a five- stranded beta- sheet core that is common to all known deaminase structures and closely resembles the structure of another APOBEC protein, APOBEC2 ( ref. 5). A comparison of APOBEC3G-CD2 with other deaminase structures shows a structural conservation of the active- site loops that are directly involved in substrate binding. In the X- ray structure, these APOBEC3G active- site loops form a continuous 'substrate groove' around the active centre. The orientation of this putative substrate groove differs markedly ( by 90 degrees) from the groove predicted by the NMR structure(6).

In contrast to methylation, the histone variant H2A. Z is preferentially deposited by the Swr1 ATPase complex near 59 ends of genes where it promotes transcriptional competence(8-20). How DNA methylation and H2A.Z influence transcription remains largely unknown. Here we show that in the plant Arabidopsis thaliana regions of DNA methylation are quantitatively deficient in H2A.Z. Exclusion of H2A.Z is seen at sites of DNA methylation in the bodies of actively transcribed genes and in methylated transposons. Mutation of the MET1 DNA methyltransferase, which causes both losses and gains of DNA methylation(4,5), engenders opposite changes ( gains and losses) in H2A.Z deposition, whereas mutation of the PIE1 subunit of the Swr1 complex that deposits H2A.Z(17) leads to genome- wide hypermethylation. Our findings indicate that DNA methylation can influence chromatin structure and effect gene silencing by excluding H2A.Z, and that H2A.Z protects genes from DNA methylation.","[Zilberman, Daniel; Coleman-Derr, Devin] Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Ballinger, Tracy; Henikoff, Steven] Fred Hutchinson Canc Res Ctr, Seattle, WA 98109 USA; [Ballinger, Tracy; Henikoff, Steven] Howard Hughes Med Inst, Seattle, WA 98109 USA","Zilberman, D (reprint author), Univ Calif Berkeley, 211 Koshland Hall, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",daniel.zilberman@nature.berkely.edu; steveh@fhcrc.org,,"Zilberman, Daniel/0000-0002-0123-8649",NSF,"We thank J.

These transcriptome analyses indicate that many of the non- coding regions, previously thought to be functionally inert, are actually transcriptionally active regions with various features. Furthermore, most relatively large ( several kilobases) polyadenylated messenger RNA transcripts are transcribed from regions harbouring little coding potential. However, the function of such ncRNAs is mostly unknown and has been a matter of debate(2). Here we show that RNA polymerase II ( RNAPII) transcription of ncRNAs is required for chromatin remodelling at the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe fbp1(+) locus during transcriptional activation. The chromatin at fbp1(+) is progressively converted to an open configuration, as several species of ncRNAs are transcribed through fbp1(+). This is coupled with the translocation of RNAPII through the region upstream of the eventual fbp1(+) transcriptional start site. Insertion of a transcription terminator into this upstream region abolishes both the cascade of transcription of ncRNAs and the progressive chromatin alteration. Our results demonstrate that transcription through the promoter region is required to make DNA sequences accessible to transcriptional activators and to RNAPII.","[Hirota, Kouji; Kugou, Kazuto; Shibata, Takehiko; Ohta, Kunihiro] RIKEN, Adv Sci Inst, Mol & Cellular Biol Lab, Wako, Saitama 3510198, Japan; [Hirota, Kouji; Miyoshi, Tomoichiro; Kugou, Kazuto; Ohta, Kunihiro] Univ Tokyo, Dept Life Sci, Grad Sch Arts & Sci, Meguro Ku, Tokyo 1538902, Japan; [Hoffman, Charles S.] Boston Coll, Dept Biol, Chestnut Hill, MA 02467 USA","Hirota, K (reprint author), Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Med, Dept Radiat Genet, Sakyo Ku, Yoshida Konoe, Kyoto 6068501, Japan.",khirota@rg.med.kyoto-u.ac.jp; kohta@bio.c.u-tokyo.ac.jp,,"Kugou, Kazuto/0000-0002-7690-1249; Hoffman, Charles/0000-0001-8700-1863","Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan","We thank W.

In addition to miRNAs, other bilaterian small RNAs, known as Piwi- interacting RNAs (piRNAs), protect the genome from transposons. Here we identify small RNAs from animal phyla that diverged before the emergence of the Bilateria. The cnidarian Nematostella vectensis ( starlet sea anemone), a close relative to the Bilateria, possesses an extensive repertoire of miRNA genes, two classes of piRNAs and a complement of proteins specific to small- RNA biology comparable to that of humans. The poriferan Amphimedon queenslandica ( sponge), one of the simplest animals and a distant relative of the Bilateria, also possesses miRNAs, both classes of piRNAs and a full complement of the small- RNA machinery. Animal miRNA evolution seems to have been relatively dynamic, with precursor sizes and mature miRNA sequences differing greatly between poriferans, cnidarians and bilaterians. Nonetheless, miRNAs and piRNAs have been available as classes of riboregulators to shape gene expression throughout the evolution and radiation of animal phyla.","[Grimson, Andrew; Chiang, H.

However, less is known about the molecular mechanisms that regulate the activity- dependent development of GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid)- releasing inhibitory synapses. Here we report the identification of a transcription factor, Npas4, that plays a role in the development of inhibitory synapses by regulating the expression of activity- dependent genes, which in turn control the number of GABA- releasing synapses that form on excitatory neurons.

Several of these pathways are implicated in disease pathogenesis, which has prompted efforts to develop GSK3- specific inhibitors for therapeutic applications.

Here we report pharmacological, physiological and genetic studies that demonstrate an oncogenic requirement for GSK3 in the maintenance of a specific subtype of poor prognosis human leukaemia, genetically defined by mutations of the MLL proto- oncogene. In contrast to its previously characterized roles in suppression of neoplasia- associated signalling pathways, GSK3 paradoxically supports MLL leukaemia cell proliferation and transformation by a mechanism that ultimately involves destabilization of the cyclin- dependent kinase inhibitor p27(Kip1).

With eight putative transmembrane domains and no apparent similarity to previously characterized channels, ANO1 defines a new family of ionic channels. The biophysical properties as well as the pharmacological profile of ANO1 are in full agreement with native Ca(2+)- activated chloride currents. ANO1 is expressed in various secretory epithelia, the retina and sensory neurons.

Many of these sensors are interferometers in which the standard quantum limit can be overcome by using quantum-entangled states (in particular spin squeezed states(5,6)) at the two input ports. Bose-Einstein condensates of ultracold atoms are considered good candidates to provide such states involving a large number of particles. Here we demonstrate spin squeezed states suitable for atomic interferometry by splitting a condensate into a few parts using a lattice potential.

In recent times, however, there have been an increasingly large number of examples in which the predictions of the Fermi-liquid theory appear to be violated(2). Although the qualitative reasons for the breakdown are generally understood, the specific quantum states that replace the Fermi liquid remain in many cases unclear. Here we describe an example of such a breakdown where the non- Fermi- liquid properties can be interpreted. We show that the thermal and electrical resistivities in high- purity samples of the d-electron metal ZrZn(2) at low temperatures have T and T(5/3) temperature dependences, respectively: these are the signatures of the 'marginal' Fermi- liquid state(3-7), expected to arise from effective long-range spin- spin interactions in a metal on the border of metallic ferromagnetism in three dimensions(3,5). The marginal Fermi liquid provides a link between the conventional Fermi liquid and more exotic non- Fermi- liquid states that are of growing interest in condensed matter physics. The idea of a marginal Fermi liquid has also arisen in other contexts for example, in the phenomenology of the normal state of the copper oxide superconductors(7), and in studies of relativistic plasmas and of nuclear matter(3,4,6).","[Smith, R.

The conditions for crack propagation are created by stress concentration in the region of the crack tip and depend on macroscopic parameters such as the geometry and dimensions of the specimen(2). The way the crack propagates, however, is entirely determined by atomic- scale phenomena, because brittle crack tips are atomically sharp and propagate by breaking the variously oriented interatomic bonds, one at a time, at each point of the moving crack front(1,3). The physical interplay of multiple length scales makes brittle fracture a complex 'multi-scale' phenomenon. Several intermediate scales may arise in more complex situations, for example in the presence of microdefects or grain boundaries. The occurrence of various instabilities in crack propagation at very high speeds is well known(1), and significant advances have been made recently in understanding their origin(4,5). Here we investigate low- speed propagation instabilities in silicon using quantum- mechanical hybrid, multi- scale modelling and single- crystal fracture experiments. Our simulations predict a crack- tip reconstruction that makes low- speed crack propagation unstable on the ( 111) cleavage plane, which is conventionally thought of as the most stable cleavage plane. We perform experiments in which this instability is observed at a range of low speeds, using an experimental technique designed for the investigation of fracture under low tensile loads.

The tsunami claimed nearly all of its victims on shores that had gone 200 years or more without a tsunami disaster(1). The associated earthquake of magnitude 9.2 defied a Sumatra-Andaman catalogue that contains no nineteenth- century or twentieth- century earthquake larger than magnitude 7.9 ( ref. 2). The tsunami and the earthquake together resulted from a fault rupture 1,500 km long that expended centuries' worth of plate convergence(2-5). Here, using sedimentary evidence for tsunamis(6), we identify probable precedents for the 2004 tsunami at a grassy beach- ridge plain 125 km north of Phuket. The 2004 tsunami, running 2 km across this plain, coated the ridges and intervening swales with a sheet of sand commonly 5-20 cm thick. The peaty soils of two marshy swales preserve the remains of several earlier sand sheets less than 2,800 years old. If responsible for the youngest of these pre-2004 sand sheets, the most recent full- size predecessor to the 2004 tsunami occurred about 550 - 700 years ago.","[Jankaew, Kruawun; Choowong, Montri; Charoentitirat, Thasinee] Chulalongkorn Univ, Fac Sci, Dept Geol, Bangkok 10330, Thailand; [Atwater, Brian F.] Univ Washington, US Geol Survey, Dept Earth & Space Sci, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Sawai, Yuki] Natl Inst Adv Ind Sci & Technol, Geol Survey Japan, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058567, Japan; [Martin, Maria E.] Univ Washington, Dept Earth & Space Sci, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Prendergast, Amy] Geosci Australia, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia","Jankaew, K (reprint author), Chulalongkorn Univ, Fac Sci, Dept Geol, Phayathai Rd, Bangkok 10330, Thailand.",kjankaew@yahoo.co.uk,"Jankaew, Kruawun/E-8130-2010; Sawai, Yuki /D-3216-2013","Sawai, Yuki /0000-0001-7015-4361; Prendergast, Amy/0000-0001-9890-7927; Arcos, Maria/0000-0003-0568-036X; Prendergast, Amy/0000-0002-4970-9956",Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment (Thailand); National Science Foundation ( USA); US Agency for International Development; Japan Society for the Promotion of Science; Thailand Research Fund; Chulalongkorn University,"We thank B.

Both the tsunami and the associated Sumatra Andaman earthquake were unprecedented in Acehnese history(3,4). Here we use sand sheets to extend tsunami history 1,000 years into Aceh's past. The 2004 tsunami deposited a sand sheet up to 1.8 km inland on a marshy beach ridge plain. Sediment cores from these coastal marshes revealed two older extensive sand sheets with similar sediment characteristics. These sheets, deposited soon after AD 1290 - 1400 and AD 780 - 990, probably resulted from earlier tsunamis. An additional sand sheet of limited extent might correlate with a documented smaller tsunami of AD 1907. These findings, a first step towards a palaeotsunami record for northern Sumatra, suggest that damage- causing tsunamis in Aceh recur infrequently enough for entire human lifetimes to typically elapse between them. Such recurrence adds to the challenge of preparing communities along the northern Indian Ocean shorelines for future tsunamis.","[Monecke, Katrin] Kent State Univ, Dept Geol, Kent, OH 44242 USA; [Finger, Willi] Swiss Agcy Dev & Cooperat SDC, Swiss Humanitarian Aid Unit SHA, CH-8002 Zurich, Switzerland; [Klarer, David] Old Woman Creek Natl Estuarine Res Reserve, Huron, OH 44839 USA; [Kongko, Widjo] Jalan Grafika, Badan Pengkajan Penerapan Teknol BPPT, Yogjakarta 55281, Indonesia; [McAdoo, Brian G.] Vassar Coll, Dept Earth Sci & Geog, Poughkeepsie, NY 12604 USA; [Moore, Andrew L.] Earlham Coll, Dept Geosci, Richmond, IN 47374 USA; [Sudrajat, Sam U.] Jalan Nasl, CRS, Meulaboh, NAD, Indonesia","Monecke, K (reprint author), Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Geol & Planetary Sci, 450 Schoolhouse Rd, Johnstown, PA 15904 USA.",monecke@pitt.edu,,,Swiss Science Foundation; US National Science Foundation; Vassar College,"We thank the field offices of Caritas Switzerland and the Catholic Relief Services (CRS) in Meulaboh for logistical support during fieldwork; D.

In a field study, here we show that the widely used herbicide, atrazine, was the best predictor ( out of more than 240 plausible candidates) of the abundance of larval trematodes ( parasitic flatworms) in the declining northern leopard frog Rana pipiens. The effects of atrazine were consistent across trematode taxa. The combination of atrazine and phosphate - principal agrochemicals in global corn and sorghum production - accounted for 74% of the variation in the abundance of these often debilitating larval trematodes ( atrazine alone accounted for 51%). Analysis of field data supported a causal mechanism whereby both agrochemicals increase exposure and susceptibility to larval trematodes by augmenting snail intermediate hosts and suppressing amphibian immunity. A mesocosm experiment demonstrated that, relative to control tanks, atrazine tanks had immunosuppressed tadpoles, had significantly more attached algae and snails, and had tadpoles with elevated trematode loads, further supporting a causal relationship between atrazine and elevated trematode infections in amphibians. These results raise concerns about the role of atrazine and phosphate in amphibian declines, and illustrate the value of quantifying the relative importance of several possible drivers of disease risk while determining the mechanisms by which they facilitate disease emergence.","[Rohr, Jason R.; Raffel, Thomas R.; Halstead, Neal] Univ S Florida, Dept Biol, Tampa, FL 33620 USA; [Rohr, Jason R.; Raffel, Thomas R.] Penn State Univ, Penn State Ctr Infect Dis Dynam, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Schotthoefer, Anna M.; Lieske, Camilla; Beasley, Val R.] Univ Illinois, Coll Vet Med, Urbana, IL 61802 USA; [Carrick, Hunter J.] Penn State Univ, Sch Forest Resources, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Hoverman, Jason T.] Univ Tennessee, Dept Forest Wildlife & Fisheries, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA; [Johnson, Catherine M.; Johnson, Lucinda B.; Schoff, Patrick K.] Univ Minnesota, Nat Resources Res Inst, Duluth, MN 55811 USA; [Piwoni, Marvin D.] Illinois Waste Management & Res Ctr, Champaign, IL 61820 USA","Rohr, JR (reprint author), Univ S Florida, Dept Biol, Tampa, FL 33620 USA.",jasonrohr@gmail.com,"Hoverman, Jason/D-1756-2013","Hoverman, Jason/0000-0002-4002-2728","National Science Foundation [DEB-0809487]; US Department of Agriculture [NRI 2008-00622, NRI 2008-01785]; US Environmental Protection Agency STAR [R825867, R833835]","We thank J.

Even when consumers are decoupled from dynamic resources, large- amplitude cycles can theoretically emerge from delayed feedback processes found in many consumers(2,3). Here we show that resource- dependent mortality and a dynamic developmental delay in consumers produces a new type of small- amplitude cycle that coexists with large- amplitude fluctuations in coupled consumer - resource systems. A distinctive characteristic of the small- amplitude cycles is slow juvenile development for consumers, leading to a developmental delay that is longer than the cycle period. By contrast, the period exceeds the delay in large-amplitude cycles. These theoretical predictions may explain previous empirical results on coexisting attractors found in Daphnia algal systems(4,5). To test this, we used bioassay experiments that measure the growth rates of individuals in populations exhibiting each type of cycle. The results were consistent with predictions. Together, the new theory and experiments establish that two very general features of consumers - a resource- dependent juvenile stage duration and resource- dependent mortality - combine to produce small- amplitude resource - consumer cycles. This phenomenon may contribute to the prevalence of small- amplitude fluctuations in many other consumer - resource populations(6,7).","[McCauley, Edward] Univ Calgary, Dept Biol Sci, Ecol & Evolut Grp, Calgary, AB T2N 1N4, Canada; [Nelson, William A.] Queens Univ, Dept Biol, Kingston, ON K7L 3N6, Canada; [Nisbet, Roger M.] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Ecol Evolut & Marine Biol, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA","McCauley, E (reprint author), Univ Calgary, Dept Biol Sci, Ecol & Evolut Grp, 2500 Univ Dr 1 NW, Calgary, AB T2N 1N4, Canada.",mccauley@ucalgary.ca,"Nelson, William/D-1405-2013; Nisbet, Roger/B-6951-2014",,NSERC ( Discovery Grants and Accelerator Award); Canada Foundation for Innovation; Canada Research Chairs Program; Alberta Ingenuity; US National Science Foundation [DEB- 0717259],"We acknowledge feedback from A. de Roos, J.

On infection, it is actively phagocytosed by macrophages(1); it then escapes from the phagosome, replicates in the cytosol, and subsequently spreads from cell to cell by a non- lytic mechanism driven by actin polymerization(2). Penetration of the phagosomal membrane is initiated by the secreted haemolysin listeriolysin O ( LLO), which is essential for vacuolar escape in vitro and for virulence in animal models of infection(3). Reduction is required to activate the lytic activity of LLO in vitro(4-6), and we show here that reduction by the enzyme gamma-interferon- inducible lysosomal thiol reductase ( GILT, also called Ifi30) is responsible for the activation of LLO in vivo. GILT is a soluble thiol reductase expressed constitutively within the lysosomes of antigen- presenting cells(7,8), and it accumulates in macrophage phagosomes as they mature into phagolysosomes(9). The enzyme is delivered by a mannose-6-phosphate receptor- dependent mechanism to the endocytic pathway, where amino- and carboxy- terminal pro- peptides are cleaved to generate a 30- kDa mature enzyme(7,8,10). The active site of GILT contains two cysteine residues in a CXXC motif that catalyses the reduction of disulphide bonds(7,8). Mice lacking GILT are deficient in generating major histocompatibility complex class- II- restricted CD4(+) T-cell responses to protein antigens that contain disulphide bonds(11,12). Here we show that these mice are resistant to L. monocytogenes infection. Replication of the organism in GILT- negative macrophages, or macrophages expressing an enzymatically inactive GILT mutant, is impaired because of delayed escape from the phagosome. GILT activates LLO within the phagosome by the thiol reductase mechanism shared by members of the thioredoxin family. In addition, purified GILT activates recombinant LLO, facilitating membrane permeabilization and red blood cell lysis. The data show that GILT is a critical host factor that facilitates L. monocytogenes infection.","[Singh, Reshma; Jamieson, Amanda; Cresswell, Peter] Yale Univ, Sch Med, Dept Immunobiol, New Haven, CT 06250 USA; [Singh, Reshma; Cresswell, Peter] Yale Univ, Sch Med, Howard Hughes Med Inst, New Haven, CT 06250 USA","Cresswell, P (reprint author), Yale Univ, Sch Med, Dept Immunobiol, 300 Cedar St, New Haven, CT 06250 USA.",peter.cresswell@yale.edu,,"Jamieson, Amanda/0000-0002-5781-9231",NIH [AI023081]; Howard Hughes Medical Institute,"We are grateful to D.

However, the analytical challenges associated with comprehensive identification and relative quantification of cellular proteomes have so far appeared to be insurmountable(3). Here, using advances in computational proteomics, instrument performance and sample preparation strategies, we compare protein levels of essentially all endogenous proteins in haploid yeast cells to their diploid counterparts. Our analysis spans more than four orders of magnitude in protein abundance with no discrimination against membrane or low level regulatory proteins. Stable- isotope labelling by amino acids in cell culture (SILAC) quantification(4,5) was very accurate across the proteome, as demonstrated by one- to- one ratios of most yeast proteins. Key members of the pheromone pathway were specific to haploid yeast but others were unaltered, suggesting an efficient control mechanism of the mating response. Several retrotransposon- associated proteins were specific to haploid yeast. Gene ontology analysis pinpointed a significant change for cell wall components in agreement with geometrical considerations: diploid cells have twice the volume but not twice the surface area of haploid cells. Transcriptome levels agreed poorly with proteome changes overall. However, after filtering out low confidence microarray measurements, messenger RNA changes and SILAC ratios correlated very well for pheromone pathway components. Systems- wide, precise quantification directly at the protein level opens up new perspectives in post- genomics and systems biology.","[de Godoy, Lyris M.

A family of proteins, known as the serpins, also forms large stable multimers by ordered beta-sheet linkages leading to intracellular accretion and disease(2). These 'serpinopathies' include early- onset dementia caused by mutations in neuroserpin, liver cirrhosis and emphysema caused by mutations in alpha(1)- antitrypsin (alpha(1)AT), and thrombosis caused by mutations in antithrombin(3). Serpin structure and function are quite well understood, and the family has therefore become a model system for understanding the beta-sheet expansion disorders collectively known as the conformational diseases(4). To develop strategies to prevent and reverse these disorders, it is necessary to determine the structural basis of the intermolecular linkage and of the pathogenic monomeric state. Here we report the crystallographic structure of a stable serpin dimer which reveals a domain swap of more than 50 residues, including two long antiparallel beta-strands inserting in the centre of the principal b-sheet of the neighbouring monomer. This structure explains the extreme stability of serpin polymers, the molecular basis of their rapid propagation, and provides critical new insights into the structural changes which initiate irreversible beta-sheet expansion.","[Yamasaki, Masayuki; Li, Wei; Johnson, Daniel J.

Recent studies suggest that the methylation status of a number of genes is dynamically regulated by methylation and demethylation(7-10). In Arabidopsis, active DNA demethylation is mediated by the ROS1 ( repressor of silencing 1) subfamily of 5- methylcytosine DNA glycosylases through a base excision repair pathway(8,10-13). These demethylases have critical roles in erasing DNA methylation and preventing TGS of target genes(7,8,10). However, it is not known how the demethylases are targeted to specific sequences. Here we report the identification of ROS3, an essential regulator of DNA demethylation that contains an RNA recognition motif. Analysis of ros3 mutants and ros1ros3 double mutants suggests that ROS3 acts in the same genetic pathway as ROS1 to prevent DNA hypermethylation and TGS. Gel mobility shift assays and analysis of ROS3 immunoprecipitate from plant extracts shows that ROS3 binds to small RNAs in vitro and in vivo. Immunostaining shows that ROS3 and ROS1 proteins co-localize in discrete foci dispersed throughout the nucleus. These results demonstrate a critical role for ROS3 in preventing DNA hypermethylation and suggest that DNA demethylation by ROS1 may be guided by RNAs bound to ROS3.","[Zheng, Xianwu; Miki, Daisuke; Zhang, Fei; Li, Wen-Xue; Iida, Kei; Kapoor, Avnish; Zhu, Jian-Kang] Univ Calif Riverside, Ctr Plant Cell Biol, Riverside, CA 92521 USA; [Zheng, Xianwu; Miki, Daisuke; Zhang, Fei; Li, Wen-Xue; Iida, Kei; Kapoor, Avnish; Zhu, Jian-Kang] Univ Calif Riverside, Dept Bot & Plant Sci, Riverside, CA 92521 USA; [Pontes, Olga; Pikaard, Craig S.] Washington Univ, Dept Biol, St Louis, MO 63130 USA; [Zhu, Jianhua] Univ Maryland, Dept Plant Sci & Landscape Architecture, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Zhang, Fei] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Plant Biotechnol Res Ctr, Sch Agr & Biol, Shanghai 200240, Peoples R China","Zhu, JK (reprint author), Univ Calif Riverside, Ctr Plant Cell Biol, Riverside, CA 92521 USA.",jian-kang.zhu@ucr.edu,"Pikaard, Craig/K-8772-2012; Zhu, Jianhua/F-7127-2013; Zhu, Jian-Kang/F-7658-2011","Pikaard, Craig/0000-0001-8204-7459; IIDA, Kei/0000-0001-7130-8705; Zhu, Jian-Kang/0000-0001-5134-731X","National Institutes of Health [R01GM070795, R01GM059138, R01GM077590, 1R01GM060380]; Edward Mallinckrodt Foundation; China Scholarship Council [2007104542]","This work was supported by National Institutes of Health grants R01GM070795 and R01GM059138 (J.-K.Z.), R01GM077590 and 1R01GM060380 (C.S.P.), Edward Mallinckrodt Foundation (O.P.) and China Scholarship Council scholarship 2007104542 (F.Z.).",,34,90,98,5,36,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,30-Oct,2008,455,7217,,,,,1259,U70,,10.1038/nature07305,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,366DZ,WOS:000260462100049,18815596,No,,,11/20/17

One of the important regulatory circuits involves lysine- specific riboswitches, which direct the biosynthesis and transport of lysine and precursors common for lysine and other amino acids(1-3). To understand the molecular basis of amino acid recognition by riboswitches, here we present the crystal structure of the 174- nucleotide sensing domain of the Thermotoga maritima lysine riboswitch in the lysine- bound (1.9 angstrom (angstrom)) and free (3.1 angstrom) states. The riboswitch features an unusual and intricate architecture, involving three-helical and two- helical bundles connected by a compact five- helical junction and stabilized by various long- range tertiary interactions. Lysine interacts with the junctional core of the riboswitch and is specifically recognized through shape- complementarity within the elongated binding pocket and through several direct and K(+)-mediated hydrogen bonds to its charged ends. Our structural and biochemical studies indicate preformation of the riboswitch scaffold and identify conformational changes associated with the formation of a stable lysine- bound state, which prevents alternative folding of the riboswitch and facilitates formation of downstream regulatory elements. We have also determined several structures of the riboswitch bound to different lysine analogues(5), including antibiotics, in an effort to understand the ligand-binding capabilities of the lysine riboswitch and understand the nature of antibiotic resistance. Our results provide insights into a mechanism of lysine- riboswitch- dependent gene control at the molecular level, thereby contributing to continuing efforts at exploration of the pharmaceutical and biotechnological potential of riboswitches.","[Serganov, Alexander; Huang, Lili; Patel, Dinshaw J.] Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Struct Biol Program, New York, NY 10065 USA","Serganov, A (reprint author), Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Struct Biol Program, New York, NY 10065 USA.",serganoa@mskcc.org; pateld@mskcc.org,,"Serganov, Alexander/0000-0001-8328-9310",US Department of Energy; National Institutes of Health,"We thank personnel of beamline X29 at the Brookhaven National Laboratory and beamlines 24-ID-C/E at the Advanced Photon Source, Argonne National Laboratory, funded by the US Department of Energy.

How the Escherichia coli 16S ribosomal RNA and the 20 proteins that make up the 30S ribosomal subunit can assemble correctly in a few minutes remains a challenging problem, partly because of the lack of real- time data on the earliest stages of assembly. By providing snapshots of individual RNA and protein interactions as they emerge in real time, here we show that 30S assembly nucleates concurrently from different points along the rRNA. Time- resolved hydroxyl radical footprinting(3) was used to map changes in the structure of the rRNA within 20 milliseconds after the addition of total 30S proteins. Helical junctions in each domain fold within 100 ms. In contrast, interactions surrounding the decoding site and between the 5', the central and the 3' domains require 2 - 200 seconds to form. Unexpectedly, nucleotides contacted by the same protein are protected at different rates, indicating that initial RNA - protein encounter complexes refold during assembly. Although early steps in assembly are linked to intrinsically stable rRNA structure, later steps correspond to regions of induced fit between the proteins and the rRNA.","[Adilakshmi, Tadepalli; Woodson, Sarah A.] Johns Hopkins Univ, TC Jenkins Dept Biophys, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA; [Bellur, Deepti L.] Johns Hopkins Univ, Program Cell Mol & Dev Biol & Biophys, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA","Woodson, SA (reprint author), Johns Hopkins Univ, TC Jenkins Dept Biophys, 3400 N Charles St, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA.",swoodson@jhu.edu,,"Woodson, Sarah/0000-0003-0170-1987","National Institutes of Health [GM60819, P41-EB0001979.]","We thank R.

The Cancer Genome Atlas ( TCGA) pilot project aims to assess the value of large- scale multi- dimensional analysis of these molecular characteristics in human cancer and to provide the data rapidly to the research community. Here we report the interim integrative analysis of DNA copy number, gene expression and DNA methylation aberrations in 206 glioblastomas - the most common type of primary adult brain cancer - and nucleotide sequence aberrations in 91 of the 206 glioblastomas. This analysis provides new insights into the roles of ERBB2, NF1 and TP53, uncovers frequent mutations of the phosphatidylinositol- 3- OH kinase regulatory subunit gene PIK3R1, and provides a network view of the pathways altered in the development of glioblastoma. Furthermore, integration of mutation, DNA methylation and clinical treatment data reveals a link between MGMT promoter methylation and a hypermutator phenotype consequent to mismatch repair deficiency in treated glioblastomas, an observation with potential clinical implications. Together, these findings establish the feasibility and power of TCGA, demonstrating that it can rapidly expand knowledge of the molecular basis of cancer.","[Chin, L.; Meyerson, M.; Winckler, W.; Verhaak, R.

Here we report the results of a collaborative study to discover somatic mutations in 188 human lung adenocarcinomas. DNA sequencing of 623 genes with known or potential relationships to cancer revealed more than 1,000 somatic mutations across the samples. Our analysis identified 26 genes that are mutated at significantly high frequencies and thus are probably involved in carcinogenesis. The frequently mutated genes include tyrosine kinases, among them the EGFR homologue ERBB4; multiple ephrin receptor genes, notably EPHA3; vascular endothelial growth factor receptor KDR; and NTRK genes. These data provide evidence of somatic mutations in primary lung adenocarcinoma for several tumour suppressor genes involved in other cancers - including NF1, APC, RB1 and ATM - and for sequence changes in PTPRD as well as the frequently deleted gene LRP1B. The observed mutational profiles correlate with clinical features, smoking status and DNA repair defects. These results are reinforced by data integration including single nucleotide polymorphism array and gene expression array. Our findings shed further light on several important signalling pathways involved in lung adenocarcinoma, and suggest new molecular targets for treatment.","[Ding, Li; Mardis, Elaine R.; McLellan, Michael D.; Fulton, Lucinda; Fulton, Robert S.; Wendl, Michael C.; Larson, David E.; Chen, Ken; Dooling, David J.; Osborne, John R.; Meyer, Rick; Shi, Xiaoqi; Tang, Yuzhu; Koboldt, Daniel C.; Lin, Ling; Abbott, Rachel; Miner, Tracie L.; Pohl, Craig; Fewell, Ginger; Haipek, Carrie; Schmidt, Heather; Dunford-Shore, Brian H.; Crosby, Seth D.; Sawyer, Christopher S.; Vickery, Tammi; Sander, Sacha; Robinson, Jody; Weinstock, George M.; Wilson, Richard K.] Washington Univ, Sch Med, Dept Genet, Genome Ctr, St Louis, MO 63108 USA; [Getz, Gad; Cibulskis, Kristian; Sougnez, Carrie; Greulich, Heidi; Lawrence, Michael S.; Winckler, Wendy; Baldwin, Jennifer; Dutt, Amit; Fennell, Tim; Hanna, Megan; Onofrio, Robert C.; Weir, Barbara A.; Zhao, Xiaojun; Ziaugra, Liuda; Zody, Michael C.; Gabriel, Stacey B.; Lander, Eric S.; Meyerson, Matthew] Broad Inst Harvard & MIT, Canc Program, Genome Biol Program, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; [Wheeler, David A.; Muzny, Donna M.; Morgan, Margaret B.; Sabo, Aniko; Hawes, Alicia C.; Shen, Hua; Jhangiani, Shalini N.; Lewis, Lora R.; Hall, Otis; Zhu, Yiming; Mathew, Tittu; Ren, Yanru; Yao, Jiqiang; Scherer, Steven E.; Clerc, Kerstin; Metcalf, Ginger A.; Ng, Brian; Milosavljevic, Aleksandar; Gonzalez-Garay, Manuel L.; Gibbs, Richard A.] Baylor Coll Med, Human Genome Sequencing Ctr, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Greulich, Heidi; Winckler, Wendy; Dutt, Amit; Hanna, Megan; Johnson, Bruce E.; Tonon, Giovanni; Weir, Barbara A.; Zhao, Xiaojun; Meyerson, Matthew] Dana Farber Canc Inst, Dept Med Oncol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Zhang, Qunyuan; Kraja, Aldi; Province, Michael A.] Washington Univ, Sch Med, Div Stat Genom, Dept Genet, St Louis, MO 63108 USA; [Chirieac, Lucian R.] Brigham & Womens Hosp, Dept Pathol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Chirieac, Lucian R.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Pathol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Chirieac, Lucian R.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Syst Biol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Thomas, Roman K.] Max Planck Soc, Max Planck Inst Neurol Res, Klaus Joachim Zulch Labs, D-50931 Cologne, Germany; [Thomas, Roman K.] Univ Cologne, Fac Med, D-50931 Cologne, Germany; [Thomas, Roman K.] Univ Cologne, Ctr Integrated Oncol, D-50931 Cologne, Germany; [Thomas, Roman K.] Univ Cologne, Dept Internal Med 1, D-50931 Cologne, Germany; [Giordano, Thomas] Univ Michigan, Dept Pathol, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Orringer, Mark B.; Chang, Andrew C.; Beer, David G.] Univ Michigan, Thorac Surg Sect, Dept Surg, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Roth, Jack A.; Wistuba, Ignacio I.] Univ Texas Houston, MD Anderson Canc Ctr, Dept Thorac & Cardiovasc Surg, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Spitz, Margaret R.] Univ Texas Houston, MD Anderson Canc Ctr, Dept Epidemiol, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Wistuba, Ignacio I.] Univ Texas Houston, MD Anderson Canc Ctr, Dept Pathol, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Ozenberger, Bradley; Good, Peter J.] NHGRI, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Watson, Mark A.] Washington Univ, Dept Pathol & Immunol, St Louis, MO 63108 USA; [Ladanyi, Marc; Broderick, Stephen; Yoshizawa, Akihiko; Travis, William D.; Pao, William] Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Dept Med, New York, NY 10065 USA; [Ladanyi, Marc; Broderick, Stephen; Yoshizawa, Akihiko; Travis, William D.; Pao, William] Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Dept Surg, New York, NY 10065 USA; [Ladanyi, Marc; Broderick, Stephen; Yoshizawa, Akihiko; Travis, William D.; Pao, William] Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Dept Pathol, New York, NY 10065 USA; [Ladanyi, Marc; Broderick, Stephen; Yoshizawa, Akihiko; Travis, William D.; Pao, William] Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Dept Computat Biol, New York, NY 10065 USA; [Ladanyi, Marc; Pao, William] Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Human Oncol & Pathogenesis Program, New York, NY 10065 USA; [Varmus, Harold E.] Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Canc Biol & Genet Program, New York, NY 10065 USA","Wilson, RK (reprint author), Washington Univ, Sch Med, Dept Genet, Genome Ctr, St Louis, MO 63108 USA.",matthew_meyerson@dfci.harvard.edu; rwilson@wustl.edu,"Wendl, Michael/A-2741-2008; Chen, Ken/A-1074-2009; Meyerson, Matthew/E-7123-2012; Dutt, Amit/I-1911-2013","Dutt, Amit/0000-0002-1119-4774; Giordano, Thomas/0000-0003-0641-8873; Chang, Andrew/0000-0001-9506-0425; Larson, David/0000-0001-7934-5906",National Human Genome Research Institute,"We thank A.

Anti- apoptotic proteins such as BCL- 2 counteract BAX- mediated cell death. Although an interaction site that confers survival functionality has been defined for anti- apoptotic proteins, an activation site has not been identified for BAX, rendering its explicit trigger mechanism unknown. We previously developed stabilized alpha- helix of BCL- 2 domains ( SAHBs) that directly initiate BAX- mediated mitochondrial apoptosis. Here we demonstrate by NMR analysis that BIM SAHB binds BAX at an interaction site that is distinct from the canonical binding groove characterized for anti- apoptotic proteins. The specificity of the human BIM- SAHB - BAX interaction is highlighted by point mutagenesis that disrupts functional activity, confirming that BAX activation is initiated at this novel structural location. Thus, we have now defined a BAX interaction site for direct activation, establishing a new target for therapeutic modulation of apoptosis.","[Suzuki, Motoshi; Tjandra, Nico] NHLBI, Lab Mol Biophys, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Tu, Ho-Chou; Kim, Hyungjin; Cheng, Emily H. -Y.] Washington Univ, Sch Med, Dept Internal Med, St Louis, MO 63110 USA; [Tu, Ho-Chou; Kim, Hyungjin; Cheng, Emily H. -Y.] Washington Univ, Sch Med, Dept Pathol & Immunol, St Louis, MO 63110 USA; [Gavathiotis, Evripidis; Davis, Marguerite L.; Pitter, Kenneth; Bird, Gregory H.; Katz, Samuel G.; Walensky, Loren D.] Dana Farber Canc Inst, Dept Pediat Oncol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Gavathiotis, Evripidis; Suzuki, Motoshi; Davis, Marguerite L.; Pitter, Kenneth; Bird, Gregory H.; Walensky, Loren D.] Dana Farber Canc Inst, Program Canc Chem Biol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Gavathiotis, Evripidis; Davis, Marguerite L.; Pitter, Kenneth; Bird, Gregory H.; Katz, Samuel G.; Walensky, Loren D.] Childrens Hosp, Div Hematol Oncol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Gavathiotis, Evripidis; Davis, Marguerite L.; Pitter, Kenneth; Bird, Gregory H.; Katz, Samuel G.; Walensky, Loren D.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Pediat, Boston, MA 02115 USA","Tjandra, N (reprint author), NHLBI, Lab Mol Biophys, NIH, Bldg 10, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA.",tjandran@nhlbi.nih.gov; loren_walensky@dfci.harvard.edu,,,"National Cancer Institute [5P01CA92625, 5RO1CA50239, 5RO1CA125562]; Burroughs Wellcome Fund Career Award; Culpeper Scholarship in Medical Science; American Society of Hematology Junior Faculty Scholar Award; William Lawrence Children's Foundation; Intramural Research Program of the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute; Searle Scholars Program","We thank E.

The hierarchical theory of galaxy formation holds that galaxies are assembled from smaller pieces, through numerous mergers of cold dark matter(2-4). The properties of an individual galaxy should be controlled by six independent parameters including mass, angular momentum, baryon fraction, age and size, as well as by the accidents of its recent haphazard merger history. Here we report that a sample of galaxies that were first detected through their neutral hydrogen radio- frequency emission, and are thus free from optical selection effects(5), shows five independent correlations among six independent observables, despite having a wide range of properties. This implies that the structure of these galaxies must be controlled by a single parameter, although we cannot identify this parameter from our data set. Such a degree of organization appears to be at odds with hierarchical galaxy formation, a central tenet of the cold dark matter model in cosmology(6).","[Disney, M. J.; Romano, J.

This is crucial in quantum computation(1), where great effort(2) must be taken to protect the integrity of a fragile quantum bit ( qubit). However, transfer of quantum information is particularly challenging, as the process must remain coherent at all times to preserve the quantum nature of the information(3). Here we demonstrate the coherent transfer of a superposition state in an electron- spin 'processing' qubit to a nuclear- spin 'memory' qubit, using a combination of microwave and radio- frequency pulses applied to (31)P donors in an isotopically pure (28)Si crystal(4,5). The state is left in the nuclear spin on a time-scale that is long compared with the electron decoherence time, and is then coherently transferred back to the electron spin, thus demonstrating the (31)P nuclear spin as a solid-state quantum memory. The overall store - readout fidelity is about 90 per cent, with the loss attributed to imperfect rotations, and can be improved through the use of composite pulses(6). The coherence lifetime of the quantum memory element at 5.5 K exceeds 1 s.","[Morton, John J.

For example, the catalytic oxidation of organic molecules(3,4), some oxidative enzymatic transformations(5-7), and the activation of dioxygen on metal surfaces(8) are all thought to involve oxo complexes. Moreover, they are believed to be key intermediates in the photocatalytic oxidation of water to give molecular oxygen, a topic of intensive global research aimed at artificial photosynthesis and water splitting(9-13). The terminal oxo ligand is a strong pi-electron donor, so it readily forms stable complexes with high-valent early transition metals. As the d orbitals are filled up with valence electrons, the terminal oxo ligand becomes destabilized(2). Here we present evidence for a d(n) (n > 5) terminal oxo complex that is not stabilized by an electron withdrawing ligand framework. This d(6) Pt( IV) complex exhibits reactivity as an inter- and intramolecular oxygen donor and as an electrophile. In addition, it undergoes a water activation process leading to a terminal dihydroxo complex, which may be relevant to the mechanism of catalytic reactions such as water oxidation.","[Poverenov, Elena; Efremenko, Irena; Ben-David, Yehoshoa; Martin, Jan M.

The geometry and amount of seismic anisotropy is generally estimated by measuring shearwave splitting, which consists of determining the polarization direction of the fast shear- wave component and the time delay between the fast and slow, orthogonally polarized, waves. In subduction zones, the teleseismic fast shear- wave component is oriented generally parallel to the strike of the trench(1), although a few exceptions have been reported (Cascadia(2) and restricted areas of South America(3,4)). The interpretation of shear- wave splitting above subduction zones has been controversial and none of the inferred models seems to be sufficiently complete to explain the entire range of anisotropic patterns registered worldwide(1). Here we show that the amount and the geometry of seismic anisotropies measured in the forearc regions of subduction zones strongly depend on the preferred orientation of hydrated faults in the subducting oceanic plate. The anisotropy originates from the crystallographic preferred orientation of highly anisotropic hydrous minerals (serpentine and talc) formed along steeply dipping faults and from the larger- scale vertical layering consisting of dry and hydrated crust - mantle sections whose spacing is several times smaller than teleseismic wavelengths. Fault orientations and estimated delay times are consistent with the observed shear- wave splitting patterns in most subduction zones.","[Faccenda, Manuele; Gerya, Taras V.] ETH, Inst Geophys, CH-8093 Zurich, Switzerland; [Burlini, Luigi] ETH, Inst Geol, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland; [Mainprice, David] Univ Montpellier 2, F-34090 Montpellier, France; [Mainprice, David] CNRS, F-34090 Montpellier, France","Faccenda, M (reprint author), ETH, Inst Geophys, Schafmattstr 30, CH-8093 Zurich, Switzerland.",faccenda@erdw.ethz.ch,,,"ETH Research Grant [TH-12/05-3]; SNF Research Grant [200021-113672/1, 200021-116153]","We thank M.

The oldest widely accepted evidence for oxygenic photosynthesis has come from hydrocarbons extracted from similar to 2.7-Gyr-old shales in the Pilbara Craton, Australia, which contain traces of biomarkers ( molecular fossils) indicative of eukaryotes and suggestive of oxygen- producing cyanobacteria(4-7). The soluble hydrocarbons were interpreted to be indigenous and syngenetic despite metamorphic alteration and extreme enrichment ( 10-20 parts per thousand) of (13)C relative to bulk sedimentary organic matter(5,8). Here we present micrometre-scale, in situ (13)C/(12)C measurements of pyrobitumen ( thermally altered petroleum) and kerogen from these metamorphosed shales, including samples that originally yielded biomarkers. Our results show that both kerogen and pyrobitumen are strongly depleted in (13)C, indicating that indigenous petroleum is 10-20 parts per thousand lighter than the extracted hydrocarbons(5). These results are inconsistent with an indigenous origin for the biomarkers. Whatever their origin, the biomarkers must have entered the rock after peak metamorphism 2.2 Gyr ago(9) and thus do not provide evidence for the existence of eukaryotes and cyanobacteria in the Archaeaneon. The oldest fossil evidence for eukaryotes and cyanobacteria therefore reverts to 1.78-1.68 Gyr ago and similar to 2.15 Gyr ago(10,11), respectively. Our results eliminate the evidence for oxygenic photosynthesis similar to 2.7 Gyr ago and exclude previous biomarker evidence for a long delay (similar to 300 million years) between the appearance of oxygen- producing cyanobacteria and the rise in atmospheric oxygen 2.45-2.32 Gyr ago(1).","[Rasmussen, Birger; Fletcher, Ian R.] Curtin Univ Technol, Dept Appl Geol, Bentley, WA 6102, Australia; [Brocks, Jochen J.] Australian Natl Univ, Res Sch Earth Sci, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia; [Brocks, Jochen J.] Australian Natl Univ, Ctr Macroevolut & Macroecol, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia; [Kilburn, Matt R.] Univ Western Australia, Ctr Microscopy Characterisat & Anal, Nedlands, WA 6009, Australia","Rasmussen, B (reprint author), Curtin Univ Technol, Dept Appl Geol, Kent St, Bentley, WA 6102, Australia.",B.Rasmussen@curtin.edu.au,"Kilburn, Matthew/C-4515-2011; Brocks, Jochen/E-3920-2012","Kilburn, Matthew/0000-0002-1858-8485; Brocks, Jochen/0000-0002-8430-8744","Australian Microscopy and Microanalysis Research Facility at the Centre for Microscopy, Characterisation and Analysis; University of Western Australia; University, State and Commonwealth Governments","We thank S.

This new species is characterized by an unexpected combination of characters seen in several different theropod groups, particularly the Oviraptorosauria. Phylogenetic analysis shows it to be the sister taxon to Epidendrosaurus(4,5), forming a new clade at the base of Avialae(6). Epidexipteryx also possesses two pairs of elongate ribbon- like tail feathers, and its limbs lack contour feathers for flight. This finding shows that a member of the avialan lineage experimented with integumentary ornamentation as early as the Middle to Late Jurassic, and provides further evidence relating to this aspect of the transition from non- avian theropods to birds.","[Zhang, Fucheng; Zhou, Zhonghe; Xu, Xing; Wang, Xiaolin; Sullivan, Corwin] Chinese Acad Sci, Lab Evolutionary Systemat Vertebrates, Inst Vertebrate Paleontol & Paleoanthropol, Beijing 100044, Peoples R China","Zhang, FC (reprint author), Chinese Acad Sci, Lab Evolutionary Systemat Vertebrates, Inst Vertebrate Paleontol & Paleoanthropol, POB 643, Beijing 100044, Peoples R China.",zhangfucheng@ivpp.ac.cn,"Sullivan, Corwin/D-4563-2009","Sullivan, Corwin/0000-0002-5488-6797","National Natural Science Foundation of China; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Major Basic Research Projects of the Ministry of Science and Technology, China","We thank F.

Its incidence has increased during the past several decades in developed countries(1,2), suggesting that changes in the environment ( including the human microbial environment) may influence disease pathogenesis. The incidence of spontaneous T1D in nonobese diabetic ( NOD) mice can be affected by the microbial environment in the animal housing facility(3) or by exposure to microbial stimuli, such as injection with mycobacteria or various microbial products(4,5). Here we show that specific pathogen-free NOD mice lacking MyD88 protein ( an adaptor for multiple innate immune receptors that recognize microbial stimuli) do not develop T1D. The effect is dependent on commensal microbes because germ- free MyD88- negative NOD mice develop robust diabetes, whereas colonization of these germ- free MyD88- negative NOD mice with a defined microbial consortium ( representing bacterial phyla normally present in human gut) attenuates T1D. Wealso find thatMyD88 deficiency changes the composition of the distal gut microbiota, and that exposure to the microbiota of specific pathogen- free MyD88negativeNODdonors attenuates T1D in germ- free NOD recipients. Together, these findings indicate that interaction of the intestinal microbes with the innate immune system is a critical epigenetic factor modifying T1D predisposition.","[Volchkov, Pavel Yu.; Stranges, Peter B.; Avanesyan, Lia; Chervonsky, Alexander V.] Univ Chicago, Dept Pathol, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Stranges, Peter B.; Avanesyan, Lia; Stonebraker, Austin C.; Chervonsky, Alexander V.] Jackson Lab, Bar Harbor, ME 04609 USA; [Wong, F.

Using these two models, we uncover the essential and interdependent roles of InlA and InlB in fetoplacental listeriosis, and thereby decipher the molecular mechanism underlying the ability of a microbe to target and cross the placental barrier.","[Disson, Olivier; Grayo, Solene; Huillet, Eugenie; Nikitas, Georgios; Dussurget, Olivier; Cossart, Pascale; Lecuit, Marc] Inst Pasteur, Grp Microorganismes & Barrieres Hote, Unite Interact Bacteries Cellules, F-75015 Paris, France; [Disson, Olivier; Grayo, Solene; Nikitas, Georgios; Lecuit, Marc] Inserm Avenir, U604, F-75015 Paris, France; [Grayo, Solene; Ragon, Marie; Le Monnier, Alban; Lecuit, Marc] Inst Pasteur, Ctr Natl Reference Listeria, F-75015 Paris, France; [Huillet, Eugenie; Dussurget, Olivier; Cossart, Pascale] INSERM, U604, F-75015 Paris, France; [Huillet, Eugenie; Dussurget, Olivier; Cossart, Pascale] INRA, USC2020, F-75015 Paris, France; [Langa-Vives, Francina] Inst Pasteur, Ctr Ingn Genet Murine, F-75015 Paris, France; [Babinet, Charles] Inst Pasteur, Dev Biol Unit, F-75015 Paris, France; [Lecuit, Marc] Univ Paris 05, Ctr Infectiol Necker Pasteur, Serv Malad Infect & Trop, Hop Necker Enfants Malad,Assistance Publ Hop Pari, F-75015 Paris, France","Lecuit, M (reprint author), Inst Pasteur, Grp Microorganismes & Barrieres Hote, Unite Interact Bacteries Cellules, F-75015 Paris, France.",mlecuit@pasteur.fr,"Lecuit, Marc/J-4073-2013; Disson, Olivier/H-6359-2016","Lecuit, Marc/0000-0002-4491-1063; Dussurget, Olivier/0000-0001-9924-0837","Institut Pasteur, Inserm; INRA; Fondation pour la Recherche Medicale; Howard Hughes Medical Institute international research scholar","This paper is dedicated to the memory of Charles Babinet, our friend and colleague, who died a few days before the submission of thismanuscript.

However, the mechanisms controlling ISC self- renewal remain elusive. Here we show that a canonical Wnt signalling pathway controls ISC self-renewal. The ligand Wingless (Wg) is specifically expressed in the circular muscles next to ISCs, separated by a thin layer of basement membrane. Reduced function of wg causes ISC quiescence and differentiation, whereas wg overexpression produces excessive ISC- like cells that express high levels of the Notch ligand, Delta. Clonal analysis shows that the main downstream components of the Wg pathway, including Frizzled, Dishevelled and Armadillo, are autonomously required for ISC self- renewal. Furthermore, epistatic analysis suggests that Notch acts downstream of the Wg pathway and a hierarchy of Wg/Notch signalling pathways controls the balance between self- renewal and differentiation of ISCs. These data suggest that the underlying circular muscle constitutes the ISC niche, which produce Wg signals that act directly on ISCs to promote ISC self-renewal. This study demonstrates markedly conserved mechanisms regulating ISCs from Drosophila to mammals. The identification of the Drosophila ISC niche and the principal self- renewal signal will facilitate further understanding of intestinal homeostasis control and tumorigenesis.","[Lin, Guonan; Xu, Na; Xi, Rongwen] Natl Inst Biol Sci, Beijing 102206, Peoples R China; [Lin, Guonan] Peking Union Med Coll, Grad Program, Beijing 100730, Peoples R China; [Lin, Guonan] Chinese Acad Med Sci, Beijing 100730, Peoples R China","Xi, RW (reprint author), Natl Inst Biol Sci, 7 Sci Pk Rd,Zhongguancun Life Sci Pk, Beijing 102206, Peoples R China.",xirongwen@nibs.ac.cn,,,Chinese Ministry of Science and Technology [2007AA02Z1A2],"We thank G.

For more than a decade, attempts to study the interaction of miRNAs with their targets were confined to the 3' untranslated regions of mRNAs(1), fuelling an underlying assumption that these regions are the principal recipients of miRNA activity. Here we focus on the mouse Nanog, Oct4 ( also known as Pou5f1) and Sox2 genes(8-11) and demonstrate the existence of many naturally occurring miRNA targets in their amino acid coding sequence ( CDS). Some of the mouse targets analysed do not contain the miRNA seed, whereas others span exon - exon junctions or are not conserved in the human and rhesus genomes. miR-134, miR- 296 and miR- 470, upregulated on retinoic- acid- induced differentiation of mouse embryonic stem cells, target the CDS of each transcription factor in various combinations, leading to transcriptional and morphological changes characteristic of differentiating mouse embryonic stem cells, and resulting in a new phenotype. Silent mutations at the predicted targets abolish miRNA activity, prevent the down regulation of the corresponding genes and delay the induced phenotype. Our findings demonstrate the abundance of CDS- located miRNA targets, some of which can be species- specific, and support an augmented model whereby animal miRNAs exercise their control on mRNAs through targets that can reside beyond the 39 untranslated region.","[Rigoutsos, Isidore] IBM Corp, Thomas J Watson Res Ctr, Bioinformat & Pattern Discovery Grp, Yorktown Hts, NY 10598 USA; [Tay, Yvonne; Zhang, Jinqiu; Thomson, Andrew M.; Lim, Bing] ASTAR, Genome Inst Singapore, Singapore 138672, Singapore; [Lim, Bing] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Beth Israel Med Ctr, Boston, MA 02215 USA","Rigoutsos, I (reprint author), IBM Corp, Thomas J Watson Res Ctr, Bioinformat & Pattern Discovery Grp, POB 218, Yorktown Hts, NY 10598 USA.",rigoutso@us.ibm.com,,"Rigoutsos, Isidore/0000-0003-1529-8631","Agency for Science, Technology and Research of Singapore; A*STAR graduate scholarship; National Institutes of Health [DK47636, AI54973]","We thank T.

The primary GBM subtype presents acutely as a high-grade disease that typically harbours mutations in EGFR, PTEN and INK4A/ARF ( also known as CDKN2A), and the secondary GBM subtype evolves from the slow progression of a low- grade disease that classically possesses PDGF and TP53 events(1-3). Here we show that concomitant central nervous system (CNS)- specific deletion of p53 and Pten in the mouse CNS generates a penetrant acute- onset high- grade malignant glioma phenotype with notable clinical, pathological and molecular resemblance to primary GBM in humans. This genetic observation prompted TP53 and PTEN mutational analysis in human primary GBM, demonstrating unexpectedly frequent inactivating mutations of TP53 as well as the expected PTEN mutations. Integrated transcriptomic profiling, in silico promoter analysis and functional studies of murine neural stem cells ( NSCs) established that dual, but not singular, inactivation of p53 and Pten promotes an undifferentiated state with high renewal potential and drives increased Myc protein levels and its associated signature. Functional studies validated increased Myc activity as a potent contributor to the impaired differentiation and enhanced renewal of NSCs doubly null for p53 and Pten (p53(-/-) Pten(-/-)) as well as tumour neurospheres (TNSs) derived from this model. Myc also serves to maintain robust tumorigenic potential of p53(-/-) Pten(-/-) TNSs. These murine modelling studies, together with confirmatory transcriptomic/ promoter studies in human primary GBM, validate a pathogenetic role of a common tumour suppressor mutation profile in human primary GBM and establish Myc as an important target for cooperative actions of p53 and Pten in the regulation of normal and malignant stem/ progenitor cell differentiation, self- renewal and tumorigenic potential.","[Zheng, Hongwu; Ying, Haoqiang; Yan, Haiyan; Kimmelman, Alec C.; Chen, An-Jou; Perry, Samuel R.; Tonon, Giovanni; Chu, Gerald C.; Ding, Zhihu; Stommel, Jayne M.; Dunn, Katherine L.; Wiedemeyer, Ruprecht; You, Mingjian J.; Wang, Y.

Unlike animal germ lines, the male germ cell lineage in plants only forms after meiosis and involves asymmetric division of haploid microspores, to produce a large, non- germline vegetative cell and a germ cell that undergoes one further division to produce the twin sperm cells(2). Although this switch in cell cycle control is critical for sperm cell production and delivery, the underlying molecular mechanisms are unknown. Here we identify a novel F- box protein of Arabidopsis thaliana, designated FBL17 ( F- box- like 17), that enables this switch by targeting the degradation of cyclin- dependent kinase A; 1 inhibitors specifically in male germ cells. We show that FBL17 is transiently expressed in the male germ line after asymmetric division and forms an SKP1 -Cullin1 - F- box protein ( SCF) E3 ubiquitin ligase complex (SCF(FBL17)) that targets the cyclin- dependent kinase inhibitors KRP6 and KRP7 for proteasome- dependent degradation. Accordingly, the loss of FBL17 function leads to the stabilization of KRP6 and inhibition of germ cell cycle progression. Our results identify SCF(FBL17) as an essential male germ cell proliferation complex that promotes twin sperm cell production and double fertilization in flowering plants.","[Oh, Sung Aeong; Brownfield, Lynette; Twell, David] Univ Leicester, Dept Biol, Leicester LE1 7RH, Leics, England; [Kim, Hyo Jung; Hong, Sung Hyun; Ryu, Hojin; Hwang, Ildoo; Nam, Hong Gil] Pohang Univ Sci & Technol, Div Mol Life Sci, Pohang 790784, South Korea; [Nam, Hong Gil] Pohang Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Interdisciplinary Biosci & Bioengn, Pohang 790784, South Korea","Twell, D (reprint author), Univ Leicester, Dept Biol, Univ Rd, Leicester LE1 7RH, Leics, England.",twe@le.ac.uk; nam@postech.ac.kr,"Twell, David/D-8043-2011","Twell, David/0000-0003-0483-1461","MOST ( KOSEF) through the National Core Research Center for Systems Bio-Dynamics; Crop Functional Genomics Research Program; Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council; BK21 research fellowship for Life Science, Kyungpook National University; KRF grant; MOHERD","We thank K.H.

Although metallochaperones(3-8) insert the correct metal into some proteins, they have not been found for the vast majority, and the view is that most metalloproteins acquire their metals directly from cellular pools. However, some metals form more stable complexes with proteins than do others. For instance, as described in the Irving Williams series(9), Cu(2+) and Zn(2+) typically form more stable complexes than Mn(2+). Thus it is unclear what cellular mechanisms manage metal acquisition by most nascent proteins. To investigate this question, we identified the most abundant Cu(2+)-protein, CucA (Cu(2+)- cupin A), and the most abundant Mn(2+)- protein, MncA (Mn(2+)- cupin A), in the periplasm of the cyanobacterium Synechocystis PCC 6803. Each of these newly identified proteins binds its respective metal via identical ligands within a cupin fold. Consistent with the Irving - Williams series, MncA only binds Mn(2+) after folding in solutions containing at least a 10(4) times molar excess of Mn(2+) over Cu(2+) or Zn(2+). However once MncA has bound Mn(2+), the metal does not exchange with Cu(2+). MncA and CucA have signal peptides for different export pathways into the periplasm, Tat and Sec respectively. Export by the Tat pathway allows MncA to fold in the cytoplasm, which contains only tightly bound copper or Zn(2+) ( refs 10-12) but micromolar Mn(2+) ( ref. 13). In contrast, CucA folds in the periplasm to acquire Cu(2+). These results reveal a mechanism whereby the compartment in which a protein folds overrides its binding preference to control its metal content. They explain why the cytoplasm must contain only tightly bound and buffered copper and Zn(2+).","[Tottey, Steve; Waldron, Kevin J.; Firbank, Susan J.; Reale, Brian; Sato, Katsuko; Cheek, Timothy R.; Gray, Joe; Banfield, Mark J.; Dennison, Christopher; Robinson, Nigel J.] Univ Newcastle, Sch Med, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE2 4HH, Tyne & Wear, England; [Bessant, Conrad] Cranfield Univ, Cranfield Bioinformat Grp, Cranfield MK43 0AL, Beds, England","Robinson, NJ (reprint author), Univ Newcastle, Sch Med, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE2 4HH, Tyne & Wear, England.",n.j.robinson@ncl.ac.uk,"Bessant, Conrad/E-7620-2010; Robinson, Nigel/J-6363-2012; Banfield, Mark/C-7453-2013; Waldron, Kevin/J-2368-2016","Robinson, Nigel/0000-0001-5586-1092; Banfield, Mark/0000-0001-8921-3835; Waldron, Kevin/0000-0002-5577-7357; Gray, Joe/0000-0003-2338-0301","BBSRC PMS committee [BBS/B/02576, BB/E001688/1]; J.

Details of this transition, including the sequence of character acquisition, have not been evident from the fossil record. Here we describe the braincase, palatoquadrate and branchial skeleton of Tiktaalik roseae, the Late Devonian sarcopterygian fish most closely related to tetrapods. Although retaining a primitive configuration in many respects, the cranial endoskeleton of T. roseae shares derived features with tetrapods such as a large basal articulation and a flat, horizontally oriented entopterygoid. Other features in T. roseae, like the short, straight hyomandibula, show morphology intermediate between the condition observed in more primitive fish and that observed in tetrapods. The combination of characters in T. roseae helps to resolve the relative timing of modifications in the cranial endoskeleton. The sequence of modifications suggests changes in head mobility and intracranial kinesis that have ramifications for the origin of vertebrate terrestriality.","[Downs, Jason P.; Daeschler, Edward B.] Acad Nat Sci Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA 19103 USA; [Jenkins, Farish A., Jr.] Harvard Univ, Dept Organism & Evolutionary Biol, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Jenkins, Farish A., Jr.] Harvard Univ, Museum Comparat Zool, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Shubin, Neil H.] Univ Chicago, Dept Organismal Biol & Anat, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Shubin, Neil H.] Field Museum Nat Hist, Chicago, IL 60605 USA","Downs, JP (reprint author), Acad Nat Sci Philadelphia, 1900 Benjamin Franklin Pkwy, Philadelphia, PA 19103 USA.",downs@ansp.org; nshubin@uchicago.edu,,,Polar Continental Shelf Project; Canadian Museum of Nature; Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia; Putnam Expeditionary Fund (Harvard University); University of Chicago; National Science Foundation; National Geographic Society Committee for Research and Exploration,"The illustrations are the work of K.

Here we show that germline mutations in the anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) gene explain most hereditary neuroblastomas, and that activating mutations can also be somatically acquired. We first identified a significant linkage signal at chromosome bands 2p23-24 using a whole- genome scan in neuroblastoma pedigrees. Resequencing of regional candidate genes identified three separate germline missense mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain of ALK that segregated with the disease in eight separate families. Resequencing in 194 high- risk neuroblastoma samples showed somatically acquired mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain in 12.4% of samples. Nine of the ten mutations map to critical regions of the kinase domain and were predicted, with high probability, to be oncogenic drivers. Mutations resulted in constitutive phosphorylation, and targeted knockdown of ALK messenger RNA resulted in profound inhibition of growth in all cell lines harbouring mutant or amplified ALK, as well as in two out of six wild- type cell lines for ALK. Our results demonstrate that heritable mutations of ALK are the main cause of familial neuroblastoma, and that germline or acquired activation of this cell- surface kinase is a tractable therapeutic target for this lethal paediatric malignancy.","[Mosse, Yael P.; Laudenslager, Marci; Cole, Kristina A.; Wood, Andrew; Attiyeh, Edward F.; Laquaglia, Michael J.; Sennett, Rachel; Lynch, Jill E.; Hou, Cuiping; Brodeur, Garrett M.; Rappaport, Eric; Maris, John M.] Univ Penn, Childrens Hosp Philadelphia, Sch Med, Dept Pediat,Div Oncol, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Mosse, Yael P.; Laudenslager, Marci; Cole, Kristina A.; Wood, Andrew; Attiyeh, Edward F.; Laquaglia, Michael J.; Sennett, Rachel; Lynch, Jill E.; Hou, Cuiping; Brodeur, Garrett M.; Rappaport, Eric; Maris, John M.] Univ Penn, Childrens Hosp Philadelphia, Sch Med, Dept Pediat,Ctr Childhood Canc Res, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Longo, Luca; Perri, Patrizia; Tonini, Gian P.] Natl Inst Canc Res, Italian Neuroblastoma Fdn, I-16132 Genoa, Italy; [Perri, Patrizia] Adv Biotechnol Ctr, I-16132 Genoa, Italy; [Laureys, Genevieve; Speleman, Frank] Ghent Univ Hosp, Ctr Med Genet, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium; [Kim, Cecilia; Hou, Cuiping; Hakonarson, Hakon] Childrens Hosp Philadelphia, Ctr Appl Genom, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Torkamani, Ali; Schork, Nicholas J.] Scripps Genom Med, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; [Torkamani, Ali; Schork, Nicholas J.] Scripps Res Inst, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; [Hakonarson, Hakon; Devoto, Marcella] Univ Penn, Sch Med, Div Genet, Childrens Hosp Philadelphia,Dept Pediat, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Hakonarson, Hakon; Devoto, Marcella] Univ Penn, Sch Med, CCEB, Dept Biostat & Epidemiol, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Devoto, Marcella] Univ Roma La Sapienza, Dept Expt Med, I-00161 Rome, Italy; [Maris, John M.] Univ Penn, Sch Med, Abramson Family Canc Res Inst, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA","Maris, JM (reprint author), Univ Penn, Childrens Hosp Philadelphia, Sch Med, Dept Pediat,Div Oncol, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",maris@chop.edu,"Cole, Kristina/M-3922-2015",,"National Institutes of Health [K08-111733, R01-CA78454, R01-CA87847]; American Society of Clinical Oncology Career Development Award; Foerderer-Murray Fund; Carly Hillman Fund; Alex's Lemonade Stand Foundation; Andrew's Army Foundation; Giulio D'Angio Endowed Chair; Italian Neuroblastoma Foundation; Center for Applied Genomics at the Joseph Stokes Research Institute; Scripps Genomic Medicine; Scripps Dickinson Scholarship; Abramson Family Cancer Research Institute","We acknowledge the families and children that participated in this research study, and the Children's Oncology Group for providing specimens.

Here we report the crystal structure of SecA bound to the SecY complex, with a maximum resolution of 4.5 angstrorm ( A), obtained for components from Thermotoga maritima. One copy of SecA in an intermediate state of ATP hydrolysis is bound to one molecule of the SecY complex. Both partners undergo important conformational changes on interaction. The polypeptide- cross- linking domain of SecA makes a large conformational change that could capture the translocation substrate in a 'clamp'. Polypeptide movement through the SecY channel could be achieved by the motion of a 'two-helix finger' of SecA inside the cytoplasmic funnel of SecY, and by the coordinated tightening and widening of SecA's clamp above the SecY pore. SecA binding generates a 'window' at the lateral gate of the SecY channel and it displaces the plug domain, preparing the channel for signal sequence binding and channel opening.","[Zimmer, Jochen; Nam, Yunsun; Rapoport, Tom A.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Zimmer, Jochen; Nam, Yunsun; Rapoport, Tom A.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Cell Biol, Boston, MA 02115 USA","Rapoport, TA (reprint author), Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Howard Hughes Med Inst, 240 Longwood Ave, Boston, MA 02115 USA.",tom_rapoport@hms.harvard.edu,,,National Institutes of Health; Damon Runyon Cancer Research Foundation [DRG-#1953-07],"We thank B. van den Berg and P.

Magnetic fields and relativistic particles are mixed with the gas as revealed by giant 'radio haloes', which arise from diffuse, megaparsec- scale synchrotron radiation at cluster centre(1,2). Radio haloes require that the emitting electrons are accelerated in situ ( by turbulence)(3-6), or are injected ( as secondary particles) by proton collisions into the intergalactic medium(7-10). They are found only in a fraction of massive clusters that have complex dynamics(11-14), which suggests a connection between these mechanisms and cluster mergers. Here we report a radio halo at low frequencies associated with the merging cluster Abell 521. This halo has an extremely steep radio spectrum, which implies a high frequency cut- off; this makes the halo difficult to detect with observations at 1.4 GHz ( the frequency at which all other known radio haloes have been best studied). The spectrum of the halo is inconsistent with a secondary origin of the relativistic electrons, but instead supports turbulent acceleration, which suggests that many radio haloes in the Universe should emit mainly at low frequencies.","[Brunetti, G.; Giacintucci, S.; Cassano, R.; Venturi, T.; Setti, G.] Ist Radioastron, INAF, I-40129 Bologna, Italy; [Giacintucci, S.; Markevitch, M.] Harvard Smithsonian Ctr Astrophys, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Lane, W.; Kassim, N.

One prominent universal element of many continuous phase transitions is the spontaneous formation of topological defects during a quench through the critical point(1-3). The microscopic dynamics of defect formation in such transitions are generally difficult to investigate, particularly for superfluids(4-7). However, Bose - Einstein condensates ( BECs) offer unique experimental and theoretical opportunities for probing these details. Here we present an experimental and theoretical study of the BEC phase transition of a trapped atomic gas, in which we observe and statistically characterize the spontaneous formation of vortices during condensation(8,9). Using microscopic theories(10-17) that incorporate atomic interactions and quantum and thermal fluctuations of a finite-temperature Bose gas, we simulate condensation and observe vortex formation in close quantitative agreement with our experimental results. Our studies provide further understanding of the development of coherence in superfluids, and may allow for direct investigation of universal phase transition dynamics.","[Weiler, Chad N.; Neely, Tyler W.; Scherer, David R.; Anderson, Brian P.] Univ Arizona, Coll Opt Sci, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA; [Bradley, Ashton S.; Davis, Matthew J.] Univ Queensland, ARC Ctr Excellence Quantum Atom Opt, Sch Phys Sci, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia","Anderson, BP (reprint author), Univ Arizona, Coll Opt Sci, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA.",bpa@optics.arizona.edu,"Davis, Matthew/A-1464-2008; Bradley, Ashton/A-7919-2008; Anderson, Brian/A-2286-2009; Neely, Tyler/A-5015-2013","Davis, Matthew/0000-0001-8337-0784; Bradley, Ashton/0000-0002-3027-3195; Anderson, Brian/0000-0002-0442-7867; Neely, Tyler/0000-0002-5691-4982",US National Science Foundation [0354977]; Army Research Office; Australian Research Council Centre of Excellence for Quantum-Atom Optics; University of Queensland,"We thank D.

A central question is how coherent electronic states, or quasiparticles, emerge from the antiferromagnetic insulator with doping. Recent quantum oscillation experiments on lightly doped copper oxides have shown evidence for small pockets of Fermi surface(2-5), the formation of which has been associated with the opening of the pseudogap - ananisotropic gap in the normal state excitation spectrum of unknown origin(1). As the doping is increased, experiments suggest that the full Fermi surface is restored(6,7), although the doping level at which the pseudogap closes and the nature of the electronic ground state beyond this point have yet to be determined. Here we report the observation of quantum oscillations in the over-doped superconductor Tl(2)Ba(2)CuO(6+delta) that show the existence of a large Fermi surface of well- defined quasiparticles covering two-thirds of the Brillouin zone.

Making integrated circuits using a bottom- up approach involving self- assembling molecules was proposed(2) in the 1970s. The basic building block of such an integrated circuit is the self- assembled- monolayer field- effect transistor ( SAMFET), where the semiconductor is a monolayer spontaneously formed on the gate dielectric. In the SAMFETs fabricated so far, current modulation has only been observed in submicrometre channels(3-5), the lack of efficient charge transport in longer channels being due to defects and the limited intermolecular pi-pi coupling between the molecules in the self-assembled monolayers. Low field- effect carrier mobility, low yield and poor reproducibility have prohibited the realization of bottom- up integrated circuits. Here we demonstrate SAMFETs with long- range intermolecular pi - pi coupling in the monolayer. We achieve dense packing by using liquid- crystalline molecules consisting of a pi- conjugated mesogenic core separated by a long aliphatic chain from a monofunctionalized anchor group. The resulting SAMFETs exhibit a bulk- like carrier mobility, large current modulation and high reproducibility. As a first step towards functional circuits, we combine the SAMFETs into logic gates as inverters; the small parameter spread then allows us to combine the inverters into ring oscillators. We demonstrate real logic functionality by constructing a 15- bit code generator in which hundreds of SAMFETs are addressed simultaneously. Bridging the gap between discrete monolayer transistors and functional self-assembled integrated circuits puts bottom- up electronics in a new perspective.","[Kirchmeyer, Stephan] HC Starck GmbH, D-51368 Leverkusen, Germany; [Smits, Edsger C.

Their origin is controversial and has been attributed to either anhydrous melting of anomalously hot mantle(1-3) or hydrous melting at temperatures only modestly greater than those found today(4,5). Here we determine the original Fe(3+)/Sigma Fe ratio of 2.7- Gyr- old komatiitic magma from Belingwe, Zimbabwe(6), preserved as melt inclusions in olivine, to be 0.10+/-0.02, using iron K- edge X- ray absorption near- edge structure spectroscopy. This value is consistent with near- anhydrous melting of a source with a similar oxidation state to the source of present- day mid- ocean- ridge basalt. Furthermore, this low Fe(3+)/Sigma Fe value, together with a water content of only 0.2-0.3 wt% ( ref. 7), excludes the possibility that the trapped melt contained significantly more water that was subsequently lost from the inclusions by reduction to H(2) and diffusion. Loss of only 1.5 wt% water by this mechanism would have resulted in complete oxidation of iron ( that is, the Fe(3+)/Sigma Fe ratio would be similar to 1). There is also no petrographic evidence for the loss of molecular water. Our results support the identification of the Belingwe komatiite as a product of high mantle temperatures (similar to 1,700 degrees C), rather than melting under hydrous conditions ( 3-5-wt% water), confirming the existence of anomalously hot mantle in the Archaean era.","[Berry, Andrew J.] Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Dept Earth Sci & Engn, London SW7 2AZ, England; [Danyushevsky, Leonid V.] Univ Tasmania, CODES, Hobart, Tas 7001, Australia; [O'Neill, Hugh St C.] Australian Natl Univ, Res Sch Earth Sci, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia; [Newville, Matt; Sutton, Stephen R.] Univ Chicago, Ctr Adv Radiat Sources, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Sutton, Stephen R.] Univ Chicago, Dept Geophys Sci, Chicago, IL 60637 USA","Berry, AJ (reprint author), Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Dept Earth Sci & Engn, London SW7 2AZ, England.",a.berry@imperial.ac.uk,"O'Neill, Hugh/G-2302-2011; Berry, Andrew/J-6725-2012; Danyushevsky, Leonid/C-5346-2013","O'Neill, Hugh/0000-0001-7018-9783; Danyushevsky, Leonid/0000-0003-4050-6850; Berry, Andrew/0000-0002-9952-6584",Commonwealth of Australia; Natural Environment Research Council; US National Science Foundation [EAR-0622171]; US Department of Energy [DE-FG02-94ER14466]; Office of Science; Office of Basic Energy Sciences [W-31-109-Eng-38],"We thank D.

The latter case resembles a prisoner's dilemma(1-4), in which one provider may try to reap the benefits of the interaction without providing the service. Here we present a game- theory model based on the marginal value theorem(5), which predicts that as long as the client determines the duration, and the providers cooperate towards mutual gain, service quality will increase in the pair situation. This prediction is consistent with field observations and with an experiment on cleaning mutualism, in which stable male - female pairs of the cleaner wrasse Labroides dimidiatus repeatedly inspect client fish jointly. Cleaners cooperate by eating ectoparasites(6) off clients but actually prefer to cheat and eat client mucus(7). Because clients often leave in response to such cheating, the benefits of cheating can be gained by only one cleaner during a pair inspection. In both data sets, the increased service quality during pair inspection was mainly due to the smaller females behaving significantly more cooperatively than their larger male partners. In contrast, during solitary inspections, cleaning behaviour was very similar between the sexes. Our study highlights the importance of incorporating interactions between service providers to make more quantitative predictions about cooperation between species.","[Bshary, Redouan; Willener, Astrid S.

It usually occurs sporadically but familial cases are observed, with a subset of cases occurring in association with congenital malformations of the neural crest being linked to germline mutations of the PHOX2B gene(1-4). Here we conducted genome-wide comparative genomic hybridization analysis on a large series of neuroblastomas. Copy number increase at the locus encoding the anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)(5) tyrosine kinase receptor was observed recurrently. One particularly informative case presented a high- level gene amplification that was strictly limited to ALK, indicating that this gene may contribute on its own to neuroblastoma development. Through subsequent direct sequencing of cell lines and primary tumour DNAs we identified somatic mutations of the ALK kinase domain that mainly clustered in two hotspots. Germline mutations were observed in two neuroblastoma families, indicating that ALK is a neuroblastoma predisposition gene. Mutated ALK proteins were overexpressed, hyperphosphorylated and showed constitutive kinase activity. The knockdown of ALK expression in ALK- mutated cells, but also in cell lines overexpressing a wild- type ALK, led to a marked decrease of cell proliferation. Altogether, these data identify ALK as a critical player in neuroblastomadevelopment that may hence represent a very attractive therapeutic target in this disease that is still frequently fatal with current treatments(6,7).","[Janoueix-Lerosey, Isabelle; Lequin, Delphine; Raynal, Virginie; Schleiermacher, Gudrun; Delattre, Olivier] Inst Curie, Ctr Rech, F-94805 Villejuif, France; [Janoueix-Lerosey, Isabelle; Lequin, Delphine; Raynal, Virginie; Schleiermacher, Gudrun; Delattre, Olivier] INSERM, U830, F-94805 Villejuif, France; [Brugieres, Laurence; Valteau-Couanet, Dominique] Inst Gustave Roussy, Dept Pediat, F-94805 Villejuif, France; [Ribeiro, Agnes; Pierron, Gaelle; Delattre, Olivier] Inst Curie, Unite Genet Somat, F-75248 Paris, France; [de Pontual, Loic; Lyonnet, Stanislas; Amiel, Jeanne] Univ Paris 05, Dept Genet, Fac Med, F-75743 Paris 15, France; [de Pontual, Loic; Lyonnet, Stanislas; Amiel, Jeanne] Hop Necker Enfants Malad, INSERM, U781, F-75743 Paris 15, France; [Combaret, Valerie; Puisieux, Alain] Ctr Leon Berard, FNCLCC, Lab Rech Translat, F-69008 Lyon, France; [Puisieux, Alain] INSERM, U590, F-69008 Lyon, France; [Puisieux, Alain] Univ Lyon 1, Inst Sci Pharmaceut & Biol, F-69008 Lyon, France; [Schleiermacher, Gudrun; Michon, Jean] Inst Curie, Dept Pediat, F-75248 Paris, France; [Frebourg, Thierry] CHU Rouen, Serv Genet, F-76183 Rouen, France; [Frebourg, Thierry] Fac Med Pharm, INSERM, U614, F-76183 Rouen, France","Delattre, O (reprint author), Inst Curie, Ctr Rech, 39 Rue Camille Desmoulins, F-94805 Villejuif, France.",olivier.delattre@curie.fr,"amiel, jeanne/H-3501-2017; Lyonnet, Stanislas/H-5483-2017","amiel, jeanne/0000-0001-5973-4728; Lyonnet, Stanislas/0000-0001-5426-9417; Janoueix-Lerosey, Isabelle/0000-0003-0434-3003; DE PONTUAL, LOIC/0000-0002-3123-0453","Agence Nationale pour la Recherche; Institut National du Cancer, the Ligue Nationale contre le Cancer (Equipe labellisee and CIT project); APAESIC; Association Hubert Gouin; Comite de l'Ain of the Ligue Nationale contre le Cancer","We are grateful to F.

Neuroblastoma harbours a variety of genetic changes, including a high frequency of MYCN amplification, loss of heterozygosity at 1p36 and 11q, and gain of genetic material from 17q, all of which have been implicated in the pathogenesis of neuroblastoma(2-5). However, the scarcity of reliable molecular targets has hampered the development of effective therapeutic agents targeting neuroblastoma. Here we show that the anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK), originally identified as a fusion kinase in a subtype of non- Hodgkin's lymphoma (NPM-ALK)(6-8) and more recently in adenocarcinoma of lung (EML4-ALK)(9,10), is also a frequent target of genetic alteration in advanced neuroblastoma. According to our genome- wide scans of genetic lesions in 215 primary neuroblastoma samples using high- density single- nucleotide polymorphism genotyping microarrays(11-14), the ALK locus, centromeric to the MYCN locus, was identified as a recurrent target of copy number gain and gene amplification. Furthermore, DNA sequencing of ALK revealed eight novel missense mutations in 13 out of 215 (6.1%) fresh tumours and 8 out of 24 ( 33%) neuroblastoma- derived cell lines. All but one mutation in the primary samples ( 12 out of 13) were found in stages 3 - 4 of the disease and were harboured in the kinase domain. The mutated kinases were autophosphorylated and displayed increased kinase activity compared with the wild- type kinase. They were able to transform NIH3T3 fibroblasts as shown by their colony formation ability in soft agar and their capacity to form tumours in nude mice. Furthermore, we demonstrate that downregulation of ALK through RNA interference suppresses proliferation of neuroblastoma cells harbouring mutated ALK. We anticipate that our findings will provide new insights into the pathogenesis of advanced neuroblastoma and that ALK- specific kinase inhibitors might improve its clinical outcome.","[Takita, Junko; Choi, Young Lim; Sanada, Masashi; Wang, Lili; Ogawa, Seishi] Univ Tokyo, Cell Therapy & Transplantat Med, Tokyo 1138655, Japan; [Chen, Yuyan; Takita, Junko; Kato, Motohiro; Igarashi, Takashi] Univ Tokyo, Dept Pediat, Tokyo 1138655, Japan; [Chen, Yuyan; Takita, Junko; Kato, Motohiro; Sanada, Masashi; Wang, Lili; Ogawa, Seishi] Univ Tokyo, Canc Genom Project, Grad Sch Med, Tokyo 1138655, Japan; [Choi, Young Lim; Soda, Manabu; Mano, Hiroyuki] Jichi Med Univ, Div Funct Genom, Toguchi 3290498, Japan; [Ohira, Miki; Nakagawara, Akira] Chiba Canc Ctr, Res Inst, Div Biochem, Chiba 2608717, Japan; [Sanada, Masashi; Wang, Lili; Mano, Hiroyuki; Ogawa, Seishi] Japan Sci & Technol Agcy, Kawaguchi, Saitama 3320012, Japan; [Kikuchi, Akira] Saitama Childrens Med Ctr, Div Hematol Oncol, Saitama 3398551, Japan; [Hayashi, Yasuhide] Gunma Childrens Med Ctr, Shibukawa 3778577, Japan","Ogawa, S (reprint author), Univ Tokyo, Cell Therapy & Transplantat Med, Tokyo 1138655, Japan.",hayashiy-tky@umin.ac.jp; sogawa-tky@umin.net,,"Kato, Motohiro/0000-0001-5145-1774","Core Research for Evolutional Science and Technology; Japan Science and Technology Agency; Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare of Japan","We thank H.

High- risk neuroblastomas are rapidly progressive; even with intensive myeloablative chemotherapy, relapse is common and almost uniformly fatal(2,3). Here we report the detection of previously unknown mutations in the ALK gene, which encodes a receptor tyrosine kinase, in 8% of primary neuroblastomas. Five non- synonymous sequence variations were identified in the kinase domain of ALK, of which three were somatic and two were germ line. The most frequent mutation, F1174L, was also identified in three different neuroblastoma cell lines. ALK complementary DNAs encoding the F1174L and R1275Q variants, but not the wild- type ALK cDNA, transformed interleukin-3-dependent murine haematopoietic Ba/F3 cells to cytokine-independent growth. Ba/F3 cells expressing these mutations were sensitive to the small- molecule inhibitor of ALK, TAE684 (ref. 4). Furthermore, two human neuroblastoma cell lines harbouring the F1174L mutation were also sensitive to the inhibitor. Cytotoxicity was associated with increased amounts of apoptosis as measured by TdT-mediated dUTP nick end labelling ( TUNEL). Short hairpin RNA (shRNA)- mediated knockdown of ALK expression in neuroblastoma cell lines with the F1174L mutation also resulted in apoptosis and impaired cell proliferation. Thus, activating alleles of the ALK receptor tyrosine kinase are present in primary neuroblastoma tumours and in established neuroblastoma cell lines, and confer sensitivity to ALK inhibition with small molecules, providing a molecular rationale for targeted therapy of this disease.","[George, Rani E.; Sanda, Takaomi; Luther, William, II; Ahn, Yebin; Diller, Lisa; Look, A.

Cellular responses to Hh and the movement of Hh through tissues are both precisely regulated, and abnormal Hh signalling has been implicated in human birth defects and cancer(3-7). Hh signalling is mediated by its amino- terminal domain ( HhN), which is dually lipidated and secreted as part of a multivalent lipoprotein particle(8-10). Reception of the HhN signal is modulated by several cell- surface proteins on responding cells, including Patched ( Ptc), Smoothened ( Smo), Ihog ( known as CDO or CDON in mammals) and the vertebrate- specific proteins Hip ( also known as Hhip) and Gas1 ( ref. 11). Drosophila Ihog and its vertebrate homologues CDO and BOC contain multiple immunoglobulin and fibronectin type III ( FNIII) repeats, and the first FNIII repeat of Ihog binds Drosophila HhN in a heparin-dependent manner(12,13). Surprisingly, pull- down experiments suggest that a mammalian Sonic hedgehog N- terminal domain ( ShhN) binds a non- orthologous FNIII repeat of CDO(12,14). Here we report biochemical, biophysical and X- ray structural studies of a complex between ShhN and the third FNIII repeat of CDO. We show that the ShhN - CDO interaction is completely unlike the HhN - Ihog interaction and requires calcium, which binds at a previously undetected site on ShhN. This site is conserved in nearly all Hh proteins and is a hotspot for mediating interactions between ShhN and CDO, Ptc, Hip and Gas1. Mutations in vertebrate Hh proteins causing holoprosencephaly and brachydactyly type A1 map to this calcium-binding site and disrupt interactions with these partners.","[McLellan, Jason S.; Hauk, Glenn; Leahy, Daniel J.] Johns Hopkins Univ, Sch Med, Dept Biophys & Biophys Chem, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA; [Zheng, Xiaoyan; Beachy, Philip A.] Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Dept Dev Biol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Beachy, Philip A.] Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Ghirlando, Rodolfo] NIDDKD, Mol Biol Lab, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA","Leahy, DJ (reprint author), Johns Hopkins Univ, Sch Med, Dept Biophys & Biophys Chem, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA.",dleahy@jhmi.edu,"Ghirlando, Rodolfo/A-8880-2009; McLellan, Jason/A-6874-2010",,Intramural Research Program of the NIH; National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases; National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship; Damon Runyon Cancer Research Foundation [DRG-1915-06];  [R01 HD055545],"We thank R.

In bacteria, secretory proteins are generally translocated after completion of their synthesis by the interaction of the cytoplasmic ATPase SecA and a protein- conducting channel formed by the SecY complex(2). How SecA moves substrates through the SecY channel is unclear. However, a recent structure of a SecA - SecY complex raises the possibility that the polypeptide chain is moved by a two- helix finger domain of SecA that is inserted into the cytoplasmic opening of the SecY channel(3). Here we have used disulphide- bridge cross-linking to show that the loop at the tip of the two- helix finger of Escherichia coli SecA interacts with a polypeptide chain right at the entrance into the SecY pore. Mutagenesis demonstrates that a tyrosine in the loop is particularly important for translocation, but can be replaced by some other bulky, hydrophobic residues. We propose that the two- helix finger of SecA moves a polypeptide chain into the SecY channel with the tyrosine providing the major contact with the substrate, a mechanism analogous to that suggested for hexameric, protein- translocating ATPases.","[Erlandson, Karl J.; Miller, Stephanie B.

Their newly synthesized forms contain either cleavable signal sequences or non- cleavable membrane anchor sequences, which direct them to the evolutionarily conserved Sec translocon (SecYEG in prokaryotes and Sec61, comprising alpha-, gamma- and beta-subunits, in eukaryotes). The translocon then functions as a protein-conducting channel(1). These processes of protein localization occur either at or after translation. In bacteria, the SecA ATPase(2,3) drives post- translational translocation. The only high- resolution structure of a translocon available so far is that for SecYE beta from the archaeon Methanococcus jannaschii(4), which lacks SecA. Here we present the 3.2- A-resolution crystal structure of the SecYE translocon from a SecA- containing organism, Thermus thermophilus. The structure, solved as a complex with an anti- SecY Fab fragment, revealed a 'pre-open' state of SecYE, in which several transmembrane helices are shifted, as compared to the previous SecYEb structure(4), to create a hydrophobic crack open to the cytoplasm. Fab and SecA bind to a common site at the tip of the cytoplasmic domain of SecY. Molecular dynamics and disulphide mapping analyses suggest that the pre- open state might represent a SecYE conformational transition that is inducible by SecA binding. Moreover, we identified a SecA - SecYE interface that comprises SecA residues originally buried inside the protein, indicating that both the channel and the motor components of the Sec machinery undergo cooperative conformational changes on formation of the functional complex.","[Tsukazaki, Tomoya; Fukai, Shuya; Nureki, Osamu] Tokyo Inst Technol, Dept Biol Informat, Grad Sch Biosci & Biotechnol, Midori Ku, Kanagawa 2268501, Japan; [Mori, Hiroyuki; Ito, Koreaki] Kyoto Univ, Inst Virus Res, Kyoto 6068507, Japan; [Ishitani, Ryuichiro; Nureki, Osamu] Univ Tokyo, Div Struct Biol, Dept Basic Med Sci, Inst Med Sci,Minato Ku, Tokyo 1088639, Japan; [Dohmae, Naoshi] RIKEN, Biomol Characterizat Team, Wako, Saitama 3510198, Japan; [Dohmae, Naoshi] RIKEN, CREST JST, Wako, Saitama 3510198, Japan; [Perederina, Anna; Vassylyev, Dmitry G.] Univ Alabama, Sch Med, Dept Biochem & Mol Genet, Birmingham, AL 35294 USA; [Perederina, Anna; Vassylyev, Dmitry G.] Univ Alabama, Sch Dent, Dept Biochem & Mol Genet, Birmingham, AL 35294 USA","Nureki, O (reprint author), Tokyo Inst Technol, Dept Biol Informat, Grad Sch Biosci & Biotechnol, Midori Ku, 4259 Nagatsuta Cho, Kanagawa 2268501, Japan.",Koreaki.Ito@ky5.ecs.kyoto-u.ac.jp; nureki@ims.u-tokyo.ac.jp,"Vassylyev, Dmitry/A-9005-2008; Dohmae, Naoshi/C-2040-2011; Sugita, Yuji/L-6726-2014","Sugita, Yuji/0000-0001-9738-9216",SORST program; CREST; BIRD; Global COE Program (Center of Education and Research for Advanced Genome-Based Medicine); National Project on Protein Structural and Functional Analyses; NIH; MEXT; Mitsubishi Foundation,"We thank K.

Mutations in the human TRPML1 gene cause mucolipidosis type IV disease ( ML4)4,5.ML4 patients have motor impairment, mental retardation, retinal degeneration and iron- deficiency anaemia. Because aberrant iron metabolism may cause neural and retinal degeneration(6,7), it may be a primary cause of ML4 phenotypes. In most mammalian cells, release of iron from endosomes and lysosomes after iron uptake by endocytosis of Fe(3+)- bound transferrin receptors(6), or after lysosomal degradation of ferritin - iron complexes and autophagic ingestion of iron-containing macromolecules(6,8), is the chief source of cellular iron. The divalent metal transporter protein DMT1 ( also known as SLC11A2) is the only endosomal Fe(2+) transporter known at present and it is highly expressed in erythroid precursors(6,9). Genetic studies, however, suggest the existence of a DMT1-independent endosomal and lysosomal Fe(2+) transport protein(9). By measuring radiolabelled iron uptake, by monitoring the levels of cytosolic and intralysosomal iron and by directly patch- clamping the late endosomal and lysosomal membrane, here we show that TRPML1 functions as a Fe(2+) permeable channel in late endosomes and lysosomes. ML4 mutations are shown to impair the ability of TRPML1 to permeate Fe(2+) at varying degrees, which correlate well with the disease severity. A comparison of TRPML1(-/-) ML4 and control human skin fibroblasts showed a reduction in cytosolic Fe(2+) levels, an increase in intralysosomal Fe(2+) levels and an accumulation of lipofuscin- like molecules in TRPML1(-/-) cells. We propose that TRPML1 mediates a mechanism by which Fe(2+) is released from late endosomes and lysosomes. Our results indicate that impaired iron transportmay contribute to both haematological and degenerative symptoms of ML4 patients.","[Dong, Xian-Ping; Cheng, Xiping; Mills, Eric; Xu, Haoxing] Univ Michigan, Dept Mol Cellular & Dev Biol, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Delling, Markus] Childrens Hosp, Dept Cardiol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Wang, Fudi] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Nutr Sci, Shanghai Inst Biol Sci, Shanghai 200031, Peoples R China; [Kurz, Tino] Linkoping Univ, Dept Pharmacol, Fac Hlth Sci, S-58185 Linkoping, Sweden","Xu, HX (reprint author), Univ Michigan, Dept Mol Cellular & Dev Biol, 3089 Nat Sci Bldg Kraus,830 N Univ, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",haoxingx@umich.edu,,,"Department of Molecular, Cellular; Developmental Biology and Biological Science Scholar Program; University of Michigan","This work is supported by start-up funds to H.

Rem1 is a cyclin that is only expressed during meiosis in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe. Cells in which rem1 has been deleted show decreased intragenic meiotic recombination and a delay at the onset of meiosis I ( ref. 1). When ectopically expressed in mitotically growing cells, Rem1 induces a G1 arrest followed by severe mitotic catastrophes. Here we show that rem1 expression is regulated at the level of both transcription and splicing, encoding two proteins with different functions depending on the intron retention. We have determined that the regulation of rem1 splicing is not dependent on any transcribed region of the gene. Furthermore, when the rem1 promoter is fused to other intron-containing genes, the chimaeras show a meiotic- specific regulation of splicing, exactly the same as endogenous rem1. This regulation is dependent on two transcription factors of the forkhead family, Mei4 ( ref. 2) and Fkh2 ( ref. 3). Whereas Mei4 induces both transcription and splicing of rem1, Fkh2 is responsible for the intron retention of the transcript during vegetative growth and the pre- meiotic S phase.","[Moldon, Alberto; Malapeira, Jordi; Gabrielli, Natalia; Gomez-Escoda, Blanca; Ivanova, Tsvetomira; Ayte, Jose] Univ Pompeu Fabra, Oxidat Stress & Cell Cycle Grp, Barcelona 08003, Spain; [Gogol, Madelaine] Stowers Inst, Kansas City, MO 64110 USA","Ayte, J (reprint author), Univ Pompeu Fabra, Oxidat Stress & Cell Cycle Grp, C Doctor Aiguader 88, Barcelona 08003, Spain.",jose.ayte@upf.edu,"Ayte, Jose/L-5217-2014","Ayte, Jose/0000-0002-6354-0536; Gogol, Madelaine/0000-0002-8738-0995; Malapeira, Jordi/0000-0003-3503-1272",Ministerio de Ciencia y Tecnologia [BFU2006-01785]; Consolider-Ingenio,"We thank P.

In human X- linked lymphoproliferative disease and its gene- targeted mouse model, loss- of- function mutations in signalling lymphocyte activation molecule- associated protein ( SAP, encoded by SH2D1a) cause a profound defect in germinal centre formation by an as yet unknown mechanism. Here, using two- photon intravital imaging, we show that SAP deficiency selectively impairs the ability of CD4(+) T cells to stably interact with cognate B cells but not antigen- presenting dendritic cells. This selective defect results in a failure of antigen- specific B cells to receive adequate levels of contact- dependent T- cell help to expand normally, despite Sap(-/-) T cells exhibiting the known characteristics of otherwise competent helper T cells. Furthermore, the lack of stable interactions with B cells renders Sap(-/-) T cells unable to be efficiently recruited to and retained in a nascent germinal centre to sustain the germinal centre reaction. These results offer an explanation for the germinal centre defect due to SAP deficiency and provide new insights into the bi- directional communication between cognate T and B cells in vivo.","[Qi, Hai; Klauschen, Frederick; Germain, Ronald N.] NIAID, Lymphocyte Biol Sect, Immunol Lab, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Cannons, Jennifer L.; Schwartzberg, Pamela L.] NHGRI, Genet Dis Res Branch, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA","Germain, RN (reprint author), NIAID, Lymphocyte Biol Sect, Immunol Lab, NIH, 9000 Rockville Pike, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA.",pams@nhgri.nih.gov; rgermain@niaid.nih.gov,"Qi, Hai/A-3955-2009; Klauschen, Frederick/C-5637-2015",,"National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease; National Human Genome Research Institute; National Institutes of Health, USA.","H.

This process is poorly understood in eukaryotes, but several factors have been implicated, including the Mre11 complex ( Mre11 - Rad50 - Xrs2/ NBS1), Sae2/ CtIP/ Ctp1 and Exo1. Here we demonstrate that yeast Exo1 nuclease and Sgs1 helicase function in alternative pathways for DSB processing. Novel, partially resected intermediates accumulate in a double mutant lacking Exo1 and Sgs1, which are poor substrates for homologous recombination. The early processing step that generates partly resected intermediates is dependent on Sae2. When Sae2 is absent, in addition to Exo1 and Sgs1, unprocessed DSBs accumulate and homology- dependent repair fails. These results suggest a two- step mechanism for DSB processing during homologous recombination. First, the Mre11 complex and Sae2 remove a small oligonucleotide( s) from the DNA ends to form an early intermediate. Second, Exo1 and/ or Sgs1 rapidly process this intermediate to generate extensive tracts of single- stranded DNA that serve as substrate for Rad51.","[Mimitou, Eleni P.; Symington, Lorraine S.] Columbia Univ, Med Ctr, Dept Microbiol, New York, NY 10032 USA","Symington, LS (reprint author), Columbia Univ, Med Ctr, Dept Microbiol, 701 W 168th St, New York, NY 10032 USA.",lss5@columbia.edu,,,National Institutes of Health,"Acknowledgements We thank M.

The existence of well- ordered rotation in galaxies during this peak epoch of cosmic star formation indicates that gas accretion is likely to be the dominant mode by which galaxies grow, because major mergers of galaxies would completely disrupt the observed velocity fields. But poor spatial resolution and sensitivity have hampered this interpretation; such studies have been limited to the largest and most luminous galaxies, which may have fundamentally different modes of assembly from those of more typical galaxies ( which are thought to grow into the spheroidal components at the centres of galaxies similar to the Milky Way). Here we report observations of a typical star- forming galaxy at z = 3.07, with a linear resolution of similar to 100 parsecs. We find a well- ordered compact source in which molecular gas is being converted efficiently into stars, likely to be assembling a spheroidal bulge similar to those seen in spiral galaxies at the present day. The presence of undisrupted rotation may indicate that galaxies such as the Milky Way gain much of their mass by accretion rather than major mergers.","[Stark, Daniel P.; Ellis, Richard S.; Richard, Johan] CALTECH, Dept Astron, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA; [Swinbank, A.

Its efficiency is represented by the Seebeck coefficient, S, which is defined as the ratio of the generated electric voltage to the temperature difference, and is determined by the scattering rate and the density of the conduction electrons. The effect can be exploited, for example, in thermal electric- power generators and for temperature sensing, by connecting two conductors with different Seebeck coefficients, a device called a thermocouple(1,2). Here we report the observation of the thermal generation of driving power, or voltage, for electron spin: the spin Seebeck effect. Using a recently developed spin-detection technique that involves the spin Hall effect(3-14), we measure the spin voltage generated from a temperature gradient in a metallic magnet. This thermally induced spin voltage persists even at distances far from the sample ends, and spins can be extracted from every position on the magnet simply by attaching a metal. The spin Seebeck effect observed here is directly applicable to the production of spin- voltage generators, which are crucial for driving spintronic(15-18) devices. The spin Seebeck effect allows us to pass a pure spin current(19), a flow of electron spins without electric currents, over a long distance. These innovative capabilities will invigorate spintronics research.","[Uchida, K.; Harii, K.; Ando, K.; Saitoh, E.] Keio Univ, Dept Appl Phys & Physicoinformat, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2238522, Japan; [Takahashi, S.; Ieda, J.; Maekawa, S.] Tohoku Univ, Inst Mat Res, Sendai, Miyagi 9808577, Japan; [Takahashi, S.; Ieda, J.; Maekawa, S.] Japan Sci & Technol Agcy, CREST, Tokyo 1020075, Japan; [Koshibae, W.] RIKEN, Cross Correlated Mat Res Grp, Wako, Saitama 3510198, Japan; [Saitoh, E.] Japan Sci & Technol Agcy, PRESTO, Tokyo 1020075, Japan","Saitoh, E (reprint author), Keio Univ, Dept Appl Phys & Physicoinformat, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2238522, Japan.",saitoheiji@appi.keio.ac.jp,"Ieda, Jun'ichi/A-3345-2009; Ando, Kazuya/A-8521-2011; Takahashi, Saburo/A-8472-2011; Uchida, Ken-ichi/H-3098-2011; Saitoh, Eiji/C-1004-2011; Koshibae, Wataru/B-2838-2013","Ieda, Jun'ichi/0000-0001-6069-8533; ","MEXT, Japan [19048028]; MIC, Japan; IMS, Japan","The authors thank Y.

This has been, however, a challenging target: in conventional metals, the high electron density restricts interface effects ( such as carrier depletion or accumulation) to a region much narrower than the coherence length, which is the scale necessary for superconductivity to occur. By contrast, in copper oxides the carrier density is low whereas T-c is high and the coherence length very short, which provides an opportunity - but at a price: the interface must be atomically perfect. Here we report superconductivity in bilayers consisting of an insulator ( La2CuO4) and a metal ( La1.55Sr0.45CuO4), neither of which is superconducting in isolation. In these bilayers, T-c is either similar to 15 K or similar to 30 K, depending on the layering sequence. This highly robust phenomenon is confined within 2 - 3nm of the interface. If such a bilayer is exposed to ozone, T-c exceeds 50 K, and this enhanced superconductivity is also shown to originate from an interface layer about 1 - 2 unit cells thick. Enhancement of T-c in bilayer systems was observed previously(5) but the essential role of the interface was not recognized at the time.","[Gozar, A.; Logvenov, G.; Bollinger, A.

Although far less enquiry has addressed the controls on river incision into the plateau itself(2), widely accepted theory(3) predicts that steep fluvial knick points ( river reaches with very steep gradients) in the eastern Himalayan syntaxis at the southeastern plateau margin should erode rapidly(4), driving a wave of incision back into the plateau. Preservation of the plateau edge thus presents something of a conundrum that may be resolved by invoking either differential rock uplift matching erosional decay(5-7), or other mechanisms for retarding bedrock river incision(8,9) in this region where high stream power excludes the potential for aridity as a simple limit to dissection of the plateau(10). Here we report morphologic evidence showing that Quaternary depression of the regional equilibrium line altitude, where long-term glacier mass gain equals mass loss, was sufficient to repeatedly form moraine dams on major rivers: such damming substantially impeded river incision into the southeastern edge of the Tibetan plateau through the coupled effects of upstream impoundment and interglacial aggradation. Such glacial stabilization of the resulting highly focused river incision centred on the Tsangpo gorge could further contribute to initiating and accentuating a locus of rapid exhumation, known as tectonic anaeurysm(6).","[Korup, Oliver] Swiss Fed Res Inst WSL SLF, CH-7260 Davos, Switzerland; [Montgomery, David R.] Univ Washington, Quaternary Res Ctr, Dept Earth & Space Sci, Seattle, WA 98195 USA","Korup, O (reprint author), Swiss Fed Res Inst WSL SLF, Fluelastr 11, CH-7260 Davos, Switzerland.",korup@slf.ch,,"Korup, Oliver/0000-0002-9084-1895",EU-FP6 [081412 IRASMOS]; Continental Dynamics Program of the US National Science Foundation [EAR-0003561],O.K. was partly supported by EU-FP6 contract 081412 IRASMOS.

These faults can accommodate extension for up to 1 - 3 Myr ( ref. 5), and are associated with one of the two contrasting modes of accretion operating along the northern Mid- Atlantic Ridge. The first mode is asymmetrical accretion involving an active detachment fault(6) along one ridge flank. The second mode is the well- known symmetrical accretion, dominated by magmatic processes with subsidiary high- angle faulting and the formation of abyssal hills on both flanks. Here we present an examination of similar to 2,500 km of the Mid- Atlantic Ridge between 12.5 and 35 degrees N, which reveals asymmetrical accretion along almost half of the ridge. Hydrothermal activity identified so far in the study region is closely associated with asymmetrical accretion, which also shows high levels of near-continuous hydroacoustically and teleseismically recorded seismicity. Increased seismicity is probably generated along detachment faults that accommodate a sizeable proportion of the total plate separation. In contrast, symmetrical segments have lower levels of seismicity, which occurs primarily at segment ends. Basalts erupted along asymmetrical segments have compositions that are consistent with crystallization at higher pressures than basalts from symmetrical segments, and with lower extents of partial melting of the mantle. Both seismic evidence and geochemical evidence indicate that the axial lithosphere is thicker and colder at asymmetrical sections of the ridge, either because associated hydrothermal circulation efficiently penetrates to greater depths or because the rising mantle is cooler. We suggest that much of the variability in sea- floor morphology, seismicity and basalt chemistry found along slow- spreading ridges can be thus attributed to the frequent involvement of detachment faults in oceanic lithospheric accretion.","[Escartin, J.] Inst Phys Globe, CNRS, Marine Geosci Grp, F-75252 Paris 05, France; [Smith, D.

Consistent with this, oral teeth are proposed to arise exclusively from ectoderm, contributing to tooth enamel epithelium, and from neural crest derived mesenchyme, contributing to dentin and pulp(3-5). Yet in many vertebrate groups, teeth are not restricted only to the oral cavity(6-9), but extend posteriorly as pharyngeal teeth that could be derived either directly from the endodermal epithelium, or from the ectodermal epithelium that reached this location through the mouth or through the pharyngeal slits(6). However, when the oropharyngeal membrane, which forms a sharp ecto/ endodermal border(10), is broken, the fate of these cells is poorly known. Here, using transgenic axolotls with a combination of fate- mapping approaches, we present reliable evidence of oral teeth derived from both the ectoderm and endoderm and, moreover, demonstrate teeth with a mixed ecto/ endodermal origin. Despite the enamel epithelia having a different embryonic source, oral teeth in the axolotl display striking developmental uniformities and are otherwise identical. This suggests a dominant role for the neural crest mesenchyme over epithelia in tooth initiation and, from an evolutionary point of view, that an essential factor in teeth evolution was the odontogenic capacity of neural crest cells, regardless of possible 'outside-in'(11) or 'inside-out'(12) influx of the epithelium.","[Soukup, Vladimir; Horacek, Ivan; Cerny, Robert] Charles Univ Prague, Dept Zool, CR-12844 Prague, Czech Republic; [Epperlein, Hans-Henning] Tech Univ Dresden, Dept Anat, D-01307 Dresden, Germany","Cerny, R (reprint author), Charles Univ Prague, Dept Zool, Vinicna 7, CR-12844 Prague, Czech Republic.",cerny8@natur.cuni.cz,"Soukup, Vladimir/G-3599-2014","Soukup, Vladimir/0000-0002-1914-283X","Ministry of Youth, Education and Sport of the Czech Republic [MSMT 0021620828]; SMWK (Dresden); COST Action B23","We wish to thank E.

Plasmodium knowlesi was the first malaria parasite species in which antigenic variation was demonstrated(3), and it has a close phylogenetic relationship to Plasmodium vivax(4), the second most important species of human malaria parasite ( reviewed in ref. 4). Despite their relatedness, there are important phenotypic differences between them, such as host blood cell preference, absence of a dormant liver stage or 'hypnozoite' in P. knowlesi, and length of the asexual cycle ( reviewed in ref. 4). Here we present an analysis of the P. knowlesi ( H strain, Pk1( A+) clone(5)) nuclear genome sequence. This is the first monkey malaria parasite genome to be described, and it provides an opportunity for comparison with the recently completed P. vivax genome(4) and other sequenced Plasmodium genomes(6-8). In contrast to other Plasmodium genomes, putative variant antigen families are dispersed throughout the genome and are associated with intrachromosomal telomere repeats. One of these families, the KIRs(9), contains sequences that collectively match over one- half of the host CD99 extracellular domain, which may represent an unusual form of molecular mimicry.","[Pain, A.; Bohme, U.; Berry, A.

How antibiotic-mediated elimination of commensal bacteria promotes infection by antibiotic- resistant bacteria is a fertile area for speculation with few defined mechanisms. Here we demonstrate that antibiotic treatment of mice notably downregulates intestinal expression of RegIII gamma ( also known as Reg3g), a secreted C- type lectin that kills Gram- positive bacteria, including VRE. Downregulation of RegIII gamma markedly decreases in vivo killing of VRE in the intestine of antibiotic- treated mice. Stimulation of intestinal Toll- like receptor 4 by oral administration of lipopolysaccharide re-induces RegIII gamma, thereby boosting innate immune resistance of antibiotic-treated mice against VRE. Compromised mucosal innate immune defence, as induced by broad- spectrum antibiotic therapy, can be corrected by selectively stimulating mucosal epithelial Toll- like receptors, providing a potential therapeutic approach to reduce colonization and infection by antibiotic- resistant microbes.","[Brandl, Katharina; Mihu, Coralia N.; Ubeda, Carles; Jia, Ting; Pamer, Eric G.] Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Infect Dis Serv, Dept Med, Program Immunol,Sloan Kettering Inst, New York, NY 10021 USA; [Plitas, George; DeMatteo, Ronald P.] Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Hepatobiliary Serv, New York, NY 10021 USA; [Fleisher, Martin; Pamer, Eric G.] Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Dept Clin Labs, New York, NY 10021 USA; [Schnabl, Bernd] Columbia Univ, Dept Med, New York, NY 10032 USA","Pamer, EG (reprint author), Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Infect Dis Serv, Dept Med, Program Immunol,Sloan Kettering Inst, 1275 York Ave, New York, NY 10021 USA.",pamere@mskcc.org,"Ubeda, Carles/L-6815-2014","Ubeda, Carles/0000-0003-0560-4658","Alexander von Humboldt Foundation; NIH [AI39031, AI42135]","The authors thank L.

An intriguing feature of T(H)17 cells is their selective and constitutive presence in the intestinal lamina propria(3). Here we show that adenosine 5 '- triphosphate ( ATP) that can be derived from commensal bacteria activates a unique subset of lamina propria cells, CD70(high) CD11c(low) cells, leading to the differentiation of T(H)17 cells. Germ- free mice exhibit much lower concentrations of luminal ATP, accompanied by fewer lamina propria T(H)17 cells, compared to specific- pathogen- free mice. Systemic or rectal administration of ATP into these germ- free mice results in a marked increase in the number of lamina propria T(H)17 cells. A CD70(high) CD11c(low) subset of the lamina propria cells expresses T(H)17- prone molecules, such as IL- 6, IL- 23p19 and trans-forming-growth- factor-beta-activating integrin-alpha V and -beta 8, in response to ATP stimulation, and preferentially induces T(H)17 differentiation of co- cultured naive CD4(+) T cells. The critical role of ATP is further underscored by the observation that administration of ATP exacerbates a T- cell- mediated colitis model with enhanced T(H)17 differentiation. These observations highlight the importance of commensal bacteria and ATP for T(H)17 differentiation in health and disease, and offer an explanation of why T(H)17 cells specifically present in the intestinal lamina propria.","[Atarashi, Koji; Nishimura, Junichi; Yamamoto, Masahiro; Honda, Kenya; Takeda, Kiyoshi] Osaka Univ, Lab Immune Regulat, Grad Sch Med, Suita, Osaka 5650871, Japan; [Shima, Tatsuichiro; Umesaki, Yoshinori; Onoue, Masaharu] Yakult Cent Inst Microbiol Res, Tokyo 1868650, Japan; [Yamamoto, Masahiro; Honda, Kenya; Takeda, Kiyoshi] Osaka Univ, WPI Immunol Frontier Res Ctr, Suita, Osaka 5650871, Japan; [Yagita, Hideo] Juntendo Univ, Sch Med, Dept Immunol, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo 1138421, Japan; [Ishii, Naoto] Tohoku Univ, Grad Sch Med, Dept Microbiol & Immunol, Aoba Ku, Sendai, Miyagi 9808575, Japan; [Evans, Richard] Univ Leicester, Dept Cell Physiol & Pharmacol, Leicester LE1 9HN, Leics, England","Honda, K (reprint author), Osaka Univ, Lab Immune Regulat, Grad Sch Med, 2-2 Yamadaoka, Suita, Osaka 5650871, Japan.",honda@ongene.med.osaka-u.ac.jp; ktakeda@ongene.med.osaka-u.ac.jp,"Takeda, Kiyoshi/C-9331-2009; Honda, Kenya/N-5297-2015; Atarashi, Koji/I-5363-2014","Nishimura, Junichi/0000-0001-8220-3423; Ishii, Naoto/0000-0002-0549-8245","Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology; Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare; Osaka Foundation for the Promotion of Clinical Immunology; Ichiro Kanehara Foundation; Sumitomo Foundation; Senri Life Science Foundation; Naito Foundation","We thank A.

However, the mechanisms leading to this aberrant PTEN localization in human cancers are currently unknown. We have previously reported that ubiquitinylation of PTEN at specific lysine residues regulates its nuclear cytoplasmic partitioning(7). Here we show that functional promyelocytic leukaemia protein ( PML) nuclear bodies co- ordinate PTEN localization by opposing the action of a previously unknown PTEN- deubiquitinylating enzyme, herpesvirus- associated ubiquitin- specific protease ( HAUSP, also known as USP7), and that the integrity of this molecular framework is required for PTEN to be able to enter the nucleus. We find that PTEN is aberrantly localized in acute promyelocytic leukaemia, in which PML function is disrupted by the PML - RAR alpha fusion oncoprotein. Remarkably, treatment with drugs that trigger PML - RAR alpha degradation, such as all- trans retinoic acid or arsenic trioxide, restore nuclear PTEN. We demonstrate that PML opposes the activity of HAUSP towards PTEN through a mechanism involving the adaptor protein DAXX ( death domain- associated protein). In support of this paradigm, we show that HAUSP is overexpressed in human prostate cancer and is associated with PTEN nuclear exclusion. Thus, our results delineate a previously unknown PML DAXX - HAUSP molecular network controlling PTEN deubiquitinylation and trafficking, which is perturbed by oncogenic cues in human cancer, in turn defining a new deubiquitinylation- dependent model for PTEN subcellular compartmentalization.","[Song, Min Sup; Salmena, Leonardo; Carracedo, Arkaitz; Egia, Ainara; Pandolfi, Pier Paolo] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Beth Israel Deaconess Canc Ctr, Canc Genet Program, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Song, Min Sup; Salmena, Leonardo; Carracedo, Arkaitz; Egia, Ainara; Pandolfi, Pier Paolo] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Beth Israel Deaconess Med Ctr, Dept Med, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Lo-Coco, Francesco] Univ Roma Tor Vergata, Dept Biopathol, I-00133 Rome, Italy; [Teruya-Feldstein, Julie] Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Sloan Kettering Inst, Dept Pathol, New York, NY 10021 USA","Pandolfi, PP (reprint author), Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Beth Israel Deaconess Canc Ctr, Canc Genet Program, Boston, MA 02215 USA.",ppandolf@bidmc.harvard.edu,"Carracedo, Arkaitz/F-7029-2011","Carracedo, Arkaitz/0000-0001-5957-1260; Salmena, Leonardo/0000-0003-4023-658X",NIH; International Human Frontier Science Program Organization; European Molecular Biology Organization,"We thank B.

Differences in DNA methylation patterns underlie a wide range of biological processes, such as genomic imprinting, inactivation of the X chromosome, embryogenesis, and carcinogenesis(3-6). Inheritance of the epigenetic methylation pattern is mediated by the enzyme DNA methyltransferase 1 ( Dnmt1), which methylates newly synthesized CpG sequences during DNA replication, depending on the methylation status of the template strands(7,8). The protein UHRF1 ( also known as Np95 and ICBP90) recognizes hemi- methylation sites via a SET and RING- associated ( SRA) domain and directs Dnmt1 to these sites(9-11). Here we report the crystal structures of the SRA domain in free and hemi- methylated DNA- bound states. The SRA domain folds into a globular structure with a basic concave surface formed by highly conserved residues. Binding of DNA to the concave surface causes a loop and an amino- terminal tail of the SRA domain to fold into DNA interfaces at the major and minor grooves of the methylation site. In contrast to fully methylated CpG sites recognized by the methyl- CpG- binding domain(12,13), the methylcytosine base at the hemi- methylated site is flipped out of the DNA helix in the SRA - DNA complex and fits tightly into a protein pocket on the concave surface. The complex structure suggests that the successive flip out of the pre- existing methylated cytosine and the target cytosine to be methylated is associated with the coordinated transfer of the hemi- methylated CpG site from UHRF1 to Dnmt1.","[Arita, Kyohei; Ariyoshi, Mariko; Tochio, Hidehito; Shirakawa, Masahiro] Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Engn, Kyoto 6158510, Japan; [Tochio, Hidehito; Shirakawa, Masahiro] Japan Sci & Technol Agcy, CREST, Kawaguchi, Saitama 3320012, Japan; [Nakamura, Yusuke] Univ Tokyo, Mol Med Lab, Ctr Human Genome, Inst Med Sci,Minato Ku, Tokyo 1088639, Japan; [Shirakawa, Masahiro] RIKEN, Yokohama Inst, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2300045, Japan","Shirakawa, M (reprint author), Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Engn, Kyoto 6158510, Japan.",ma4@eng.mbox.media.kyoto-u.ac.jp; shirakawa@moleng.kyoto-u.ac.jp,"Tochio, Hidehito/F-6109-2011","Tochio, Hidehito/0000-0003-3843-3330; Ariyoshi, Mariko/0000-0002-1361-2642","Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT) of Japan; Japan Science and Technology Agency; Japan Society for the Promotion of Science; Global COE Program 'Integrated Materials Science' of MEXT of Japan","We thank K.

UHRF1 ( also known as ICBP90 in humans and Np95 in mouse)(3) is an E3 ligase important for the maintenance of global and local DNA methylation in vivo(4,5). The preferential affinity of UHRF1 for hemi- methylated DNA over symmetrically methylated DNA by means of its SET and RING- associated ( SRA) domain(6) and its association with the maintenance DNA methyltransferase 1 ( DNMT1) suggests a role in replication of the epigenetic code(4,5,7). Here we report the 1.7 angstrom crystal structure of the apo SRA domain of human UHRF1 and a 2.2 angstrom structure of its complex with hemi- methylated DNA, revealing a previously unknown reading mechanism for methylated CpG sites ( mCpG). The SRA - DNA complex has several notable structural features including a binding pocket that accommodates the 5-methylcytosine that is flipped out of the duplex DNA. Two specialized loops reach through the resulting gap in the DNA from both the major and the minor grooves to read the other three bases of the CpG duplex. The major groove loop confers both specificity for the CpG dinucleotide and discrimination against methylation of deoxycytidine of the complementary strand. The structure, along with mutagenesis data, suggests how UHRF1 acts as a key factor for DNMT1 maintenance methylation through recognition of a fundamental unit of epigenetic inheritance, mCpG.","[Avvakumov, George V.; Walker, John R.; Xue, Sheng; Li, Yanjun; Arrowsmith, Cheryl H.; Dhe-Paganon, Sirano] Univ Toronto, Struct Genom Consortium, Toronto, ON M5G 1L5, Canada; [Duan, Shili; Arrowsmith, Cheryl H.] Univ Toronto, Ontario Canc Inst, Toronto, ON M5G 1L5, Canada; [Duan, Shili; Arrowsmith, Cheryl H.] Univ Toronto, Dept Med Biophys, Toronto, ON M5G 1L5, Canada; [Bronner, Christian] Univ Louis Pasteur Strasbourg 1, Dept Pharmacol & Pharmacochim Interact Cellulaire, Fac Pharm, CNRS,IGL,UMR 7175, F-67401 Illkirch Graffenstaden, France; [Dhe-Paganon, Sirano] Univ Toronto, Dept Physiol, Toronto, ON M5G 1L5, Canada","Dhe-Paganon, S (reprint author), Univ Toronto, Struct Genom Consortium, 100 Coll St, Toronto, ON M5G 1L5, Canada.",sirano.dhepaganon@utoronto.ca,,"/0000-0002-5255-895X; BRONNER, Christian/0000-0002-3101-9279","Canadian Institutes for Health Research; Canadian Foundation for Innovation; Ontario Genomics Institute; GlaxoSmithKline; Karolinska Institutet; Knut; Alice Wallenberg Foundation; Ontario Innovation Trust; Ontario Ministry for Research and Innovation; Merck Co., Inc; Novartis Research Foundation; Swedish Agency for Innovation Systems; Swedish Foundation for Strategic Research; Wellcome Trust; Canadian Cancer Society","We thank F.

UHRF1 ( ubiquitin- like, containing PHD and RING finger domains 1) is required for maintenance methylation by interacting with DNA nucleotide methyltransferase 1 ( DNMT1), the maintenance methyltransferase, and with hemi-methylated CpG, the substrate for DNMT1 ( refs 1 and 2). Here we present the crystal structure of the SET and RING- associated ( SRA) domain of mouse UHRF1 in complex with DNA containing a hemimethylated CpGsite. The DNA is contacted in both the major and minor grooves by two loops that penetrate into the middle of the DNA helix. The 5- methylcytosine has flipped completely out of the DNA helix and is positioned in a binding pocket with planar stacking contacts, Watson - Crick polar hydrogen bonds and van der Waals interactions specific for 5- methylcytosine. Hence, UHRF1 contains a previously unknown DNA- binding module and is the first example of a non- enzymatic, sequence- specific DNA- binding protein domain to use the base flipping mechanism to interact with DNA.","[Hashimoto, Hideharu; Horton, John R.; Zhang, Xing; Cheng, Xiaodong] Emory Univ, Sch Med, Dept Biochem, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA; [Bostick, Magnolia; Jacobsen, Steven E.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Mol Cell & Dev Biol, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Jacobsen, Steven E.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA","Cheng, XD (reprint author), Emory Univ, Sch Med, Dept Biochem, 1510 Clifton Rd, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA.",xcheng@emory.edu,"Horton, John/F-2375-2010; Hashimoto, Hideharu/C-2079-2012","Hashimoto, Hideharu/0000-0002-5674-5779","National Institutes of Health [GM049245, GM060398]; NIH-NSRA Fellowship [CA1263022]; Howard Hughes Medical Institute; Georgia Research Alliance Eminent Scholar",We thank R.

However, empirical evidence is rare and incomplete. Here we demonstrate sensory drive speciation within island populations of cichlid fish. We identify the ecological and molecular basis of divergent evolution in the cichlid visual system, demonstrate associated divergence in male colouration and female preferences, and show subsequent differentiation at neutral loci, indicating reproductive isolation. Evidence is replicated in several pairs of sympatric populations and species. Variation in the slope of the environmental gradients explains variation in the progress towards speciation: speciation occurs on all but the steepest gradients. This is the most complete demonstration so far of speciation through sensory drive without geographical isolation.

Although isolated examples of adult cell reprogramming are known, there is no general understanding of how to turn one cell type into another in a controlled manner. Here, using a strategy of re- expressing key developmental regulators in vivo, we identify a specific combination of three transcription factors (Ngn3 ( also known as Neurog3) Pdx1 and Mafa) that reprograms differentiated pancreatic exocrine cells in adult mice into cells that closely resemble beta-cells. The induced beta-cells are indistinguishable from endogenous islet beta-cells in size, shape and ultrastructure. They express genes essential for beta-cell function and can ameliorate hyperglycaemia by remodelling local vasculature and secreting insulin. This study provides an example of cellular reprogramming using defined factors in an adult organ and suggests a general paradigm for directing cell reprogramming without reversion to a pluripotent stem cell state.","[Zhou, Qiao; Kanarek, Andrew; Rajagopal, Jayaraj; Melton, Douglas A.] Harvard Univ, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Dept Stem Cell & Regenerat Biol, Harvard Stem Cell Inst, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Brown, Juliana] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Childrens Hosp, Dept Pathol,Harvard Stem Cell Inst, Boston, MA 02115 USA","Melton, DA (reprint author), Harvard Univ, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Dept Stem Cell & Regenerat Biol, Harvard Stem Cell Inst, 7 Divin Ave, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",dmelton@harvard.edu,,,Damon-Runyon Cancer Research Foundation Postdoctoral Fellowship; Pathway to Independence (PI) Award; National Institute of Health; Harvard Stem Cell Institute; NIH,"We are grateful to M.

Telomere length deregulation and telomerase activation is an early, and perhaps necessary, step in cancer cell evolution. Here we present the high- resolution structure of the Tribolium castaneum catalytic subunit of telomerase, TERT. The protein consists of three highly conserved domains, organized into a ring- like structure that shares common features with retroviral reverse transcriptases, viral RNA polymerases and B- family DNA polymerases. Domain organization places motifs implicated in substrate binding and catalysis in the interior of the ring, which can accommodate seven to eight bases of double- stranded nucleic acid. Modelling of an RNA - DNA heteroduplex in the interior of this ring demonstrates a perfect fit between the protein and the nucleic acid substrate, and positions the 39- end of the DNA primer at the active site of the enzyme, providing evidence for the formation of an active telomerase elongation complex.","[Gillis, Andrew J.; Schuller, Anthony P.; Skordalakes, Emmanuel] Wistar Inst Anat & Biol, Gene Express & Regulat Program, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA","Skordalakes, E (reprint author), Wistar Inst Anat & Biol, Gene Express & Regulat Program, 3601 Spruce St, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",skorda@wistar.org,,"Skordalakes, Emmanuel/0000-0002-7600-2833",Pennsylvania Department of Health; The Ellison Medical Foundation,We thank R.

The field associated with ionized interstellar gas has been determined through observations of pulsars in our Galaxy. Radiofrequency measurements of pulse dispersion and the rotation of the plane of linear polarization, that is, Faraday rotation, yield an average value for the magnetic field of B approximate to 3 mu G (ref. 2). The possible detection of Faraday rotation of linearly polarized photons emitted by high-redshift quasars(3) suggests similar magnetic fields are present in foreground galaxies with redshifts z > 1. As Faraday rotation alone, however, determines neither the magnitude nor the redshift of the magnetic field, the strength of galactic magnetic fields at redshifts z. 0 remains uncertain. Here we report a measurement of a magnetic field of B approximate to 84 mu G in a galaxy at z = 0.692, using the same Zeeman- splitting technique that revealed an average value of B = 6 mu G in the neutral interstellar gas of our Galaxy(4).

Disk galaxies show a strong cut- off in H alpha radiation at a certain galactocentric distance, which has led to the conclusion that star formation is suppressed in the outer regions of disk galaxies. This is seemingly in contradiction to recent observations(1) in the ultraviolet which imply that disk galaxies have star formation beyond the H alpha cut- off, and that the star-formation-rate surface density is linearly related to the underlying gas surface density, which is a shallower relationship than that derived from H alpha luminosities(2). In a galaxy- wide formulation, the clustered nature of star formation has recently led to the insight that the total galactic H alpha luminosity is nonlinearly related to the galaxy- wide star formation rate(3). Here we show that a local formulation of the concept of clustered star formation naturally leads to a steeper radial decrease in the H alpha surface luminosity than in the star-formation-rate surface density, in quantitative agreement with the observations, and that the observed H alpha cut- off arises naturally.","[Pflamm-Altenburg, Jan; Kroupa, Pavel] Univ Bonn, Argelander Inst Astron, D-53121 Bonn, Germany","Pflamm-Altenburg, J (reprint author), Univ Bonn, Argelander Inst Astron, D-53121 Bonn, Germany.",jpflamm@astro.uni-bonn.de,,,,,,30,46,46,0,1,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,2-Oct,2008,455,7213,,,,,641,643,,10.1038/nature07266,,3,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,354KY,WOS:000259639700041,18833274,No,,,11/20/17

For example, at a distance of 10 nm, the spin of a single electron produces a magnetic field of about 1 mu T, and the corresponding field from a single proton is a few nanoteslas. A sensor able to detect such magnetic fields with nanometre spatial resolution would enable powerful applications, ranging from the detection of magnetic resonance signals from individual electron or nuclear spins in complex biological molecules(5,6) to readout of classical or quantum bits of information encoded in an electron or nuclear spin memory(7). Here we experimentally demonstrate an approach to such nanoscale magnetic sensing, using coherent manipulation of an individual electronic spin qubit associated with a nitrogen- vacancy impurity in diamond at room temperature(8). Using an ultra- pure diamond sample, we achieve detection of 3 nT magnetic fields at kilohertz frequencies after 100 s of averaging. In addition, we demonstrate a sensitivity of 0.5 mu THz(-1/2) for a diamond nanocrystal with a diameter of 30 nm.","[Maze, J. R.; Hodges, J.

Recently, it was shown that this limit can be partly overcome by nonlinear imaging techniques(1,2), but there is still a barrier to reaching the molecular scale. In contrast, in magnetic resonance imaging the spatial resolution is not determined by diffraction; rather, it is limited by magnetic field sensitivity, and so can in principle go well below the optical wavelength. The sensitivity of magnetic resonance imaging has recently been improved enough to image single cells(3,4), and magnetic resonance force microscopy(5) has succeeded in detecting single electrons(6) and small nuclear spin ensembles(7). However, this technique currently requires cryogenic temperatures, which limit most potential biological applications(8). Alternatively, single-electron spin states can be detected optically(9,10), even at room temperature in some systems(11-14). Here we show how magneto- optical spin detection can be used to determine the location of a spin associated with a single nitrogen- vacancy centre in diamond with nanometre resolution under ambient conditions. By placing these nitrogen- vacancy spins in functionalized diamond nanocrystals, biologically specific magnetofluorescent spin markers can be produced. Significantly, we show that this nanometre- scale resolution can be achieved without any probes located closer than typical cell dimensions. Furthermore, we demonstrate the use of a single diamond spin as a scanning probe magnetometer to map nanoscale magnetic field variations. The potential impact of single- spin imaging at room temperature is far- reaching. It could lead to the capability to probe biologically relevant spins in living cells.","[Balasubramanian, Gopalakrishnan; Kolesov, Roman; Al-Hmoud, Mohannad; Tisler, Julia; Jelezko, Fedor; Wrachtrup, Joerg] Univ Stuttgart, Inst Phys 3, D-70550 Stuttgart, Germany; [Chan, I.

The pivotal early Oligocene event is characterized by a rapid shift of 1.5 parts per thousand in deep- sea benthic oxygen- isotope values(3) ( Oi- 1) within a few hundred thousand years(4), reflecting a combination of terrestrial ice growth and deep- sea cooling. The apparent absence of contemporaneous cooling in deep- sea Mg/Ca records(4-6), however, has been argued to reflect the growth of more ice than can be accommodated on Antarctica; this, combined with new evidence of continental cooling(7) and ice- rafted debris(8,9) in the Northern Hemisphere during this period, raises the possibility that Oi- 1 represents a precursory bipolar glaciation. Here we test this hypothesis using an isotope-capable global climate/ ice- sheet model that accommodates both the long- term decline of Cenozoic atmospheric CO(2) levels(10,11) and the effects of orbital forcing(12). We show that the CO2 threshold below which glaciation occurs in the Northern Hemisphere (similar to 280 p.p.m.v.) is much lower than that for Antarctica (similar to 750 p.p.m.v.). Therefore, the growth of ice sheets in the Northern Hemisphere immediately following Antarctic glaciation would have required rapid CO2 drawdown within the Oi- 1 time-frame, to levels lower than those estimated by geochemical proxies(10,11) and carbon- cycle models(13,14). Instead of bipolar glaciation, we find that Oi- 1 is best explained by Antarctic glaciation alone, combined with deep- sea cooling of up to 4 degrees C and Antarctic ice that is less isotopically depleted (-30 to -35 parts per thousand) than previously suggested(15,16). Proxy CO(2) estimates remain above our model's northern- hemispheric glaciation threshold of similar to 280 p.p.m.v. until similar to 25 Myr ago, but have been near or below that level ever since(10,11). This implies that episodic northern- hemispheric ice sheets have been possible some 20 million years earlier than currently assumed ( although still much later than Oi- 1) and could explain some of the variability in Miocene sea- level records(17,18).","[DeConto, Robert M.] Univ Massachusetts, Dept Geosci, Amherst, MA 01003 USA; [Pollard, David] Penn State Univ, Earth & Environm Syst Inst, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Wilson, Paul A.; Palike, Heiko] Univ Southampton, Natl Oceanog Ctr, Southampton SO14 3ZH, Hants, England; [Lear, Caroline H.] Cardiff Univ, Sch Earth & Ocean Sci, Cardiff CF10 3YE, Wales; [Pagani, Mark] Yale Univ, Dept Geol & Geophys, New Haven, CT 06520 USA","DeConto, RM (reprint author), Univ Massachusetts, Dept Geosci, Amherst, MA 01003 USA.",deconto@geo.umass.edu,"Palike, Heiko/A-6560-2008; Pagani, Mark/B-3233-2008; Lear, Caroline/D-2582-2009","Palike, Heiko/0000-0003-3386-0923; Lear, Caroline/0000-0002-7533-4430",National Science Foundation.,This material is based on work supported by the National Science Foundation.,,34,179,183,10,99,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,2-Oct,2008,455,7213,,,,,652,U52,,10.1038/nature07337,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,354KY,WOS:000259639700044,18833277,No,Y,N,11/20/17

Akimotoite is thought to be a major constituent of the harzburgite layer of subducting slabs, and the most anisotropic mineral in the mantle transition zone(2-4). It has been predicted that if akimotoite crystals are preferentially oriented by plastic deformation, a cold subducted slab would be extremely anisotropic(5). However, there have been no studies of crystallographic preferred orientations and very few reports of plastic deformation experiments for MgSiO3 ilmenite. Here we present plastic deformation experiments on polycrystalline akimotoite, which were conducted at confining pressures of 20-22 GPa and temperatures of 1,000-1,300 degrees C. We found a change in crystallographic preferred orientation pattern of akimotoite with temperature, where the c-axis maximum parallel to the compression direction develops at high temperature, whereas the c axes are preferentially oriented parallel to the shear direction or perpendicular to the compression direction at lower temperature. The previously reported difference in compressional- wave seismic anisotropy between the northern and southern segments of the Tonga slab at depths of the mantle transition zone(6) can conceivably be attributed to the difference in the crystallographic preferred orientation pattern of akimotoite at varying temperature within the slab.","[Shiraishi, Rei; Ohtani, Eiji; Shimojuku, Akira] Tohoku Univ, Inst Mineral Petrol & Econ Geol, Sendai, Miyagi 9808578, Japan; [Zhao, Dapeng] Tohoku Univ, Dept Geophys, Sendai, Miyagi 9808578, Japan; [Kanagawa, Kyuichi] Chiba Univ, Dept Earth Sci, Chiba 2638522, Japan; [Shimojuku, Akira] Kyushu Univ, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, Fac Sci, Fukuoka 8128581, Japan","Shiraishi, R (reprint author), Tohoku Univ, Inst Mineral Petrol & Econ Geol, Sendai, Miyagi 9808578, Japan.",siraisir@ganko.tohoku.ac.jp,,"Zhao, Dapeng/0000-0003-2096-5195; Ohtani, Eiji/0000-0001-8631-0736","Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research; Ministry of Education, Culture, Science, Sport, and Technology of the Japanese Government.","This work was supported by a Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research from the Ministry of Education, Culture, Science, Sport, and Technology of the Japanese Government.",,26,10,10,2,17,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,2-Oct,2008,455,7213,,,,,657,660,,10.1038/nature07301,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,354KY,WOS:000259639700045,18833278,No,,,11/20/17

A viral sequence from 1959 ( ZR59) is the oldest known HIV- 1 infection(1). Other historically documented sequences, important calibration points to convert evolutionary distance into time, are lacking, however; ZR59 is the only one sampled before 1976. Here we report the amplification and characterization of viral sequences from a Bouin's- fixed paraffin- embedded lymph node biopsy specimen obtained in 1960 from an adult female in Leopoldville, Belgian Congo ( now Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of the Congo ( DRC)), and we use them to conduct the first comparative evolutionary genetic study of early pre- AIDS epidemic HIV- 1 group M viruses. Phylogenetic analyses position this viral sequence ( DRC60) closest to the ancestral node of subtype A ( excluding A2). Relaxed molecular clock analyses incorporating DRC60 and ZR59 date the most recent common ancestor of the M group to near the beginning of the twentieth century. The sizeable genetic distance between DRC60 and ZR59 directly demonstrates that diversification of HIV- 1 in west- central Africa occurred long before the recognized AIDS pandemic. The recovery of viral gene sequences from decades- old paraffin- embedded tissues opens the door to a detailed palaeovirological investigation of the evolutionary history of HIV- 1 that is not accessible by other methods.","[Worobey, Michael; Gemmel, Marlea; Haselkorn, Tamara; Gilbert, M.

Competence in some domains of mathematics, such as calculus, relies on symbolic representations that are unique to humans who have undergone explicit teaching(1,2). More basic numerical intuitions are supported by an evolutionarily ancient approximate number system that is shared by adults(3-6), infants(7) and non- human animals(8-13) - these groups can all represent the approximate number of items in visual or auditory arrays without verbally counting, and use this capacity to guide everyday behaviour such as foraging. Despite the widespread nature of the approximate number system both across species and across development, it is not known whether some individuals have a more precise non- verbal 'number sense' than others. Furthermore, the extent to which this system interfaces with the formal, symbolic maths abilities that humans acquire by explicit instruction remains unknown. Here we show that there are large individual differences in the non- verbal approximation abilities of 14- year- old children, and that these individual differences in the present correlate with children's past scores on standardized maths achievement tests, extending all the way back to kindergarten. Moreover, this correlation remains significant when controlling for individual differences in other cognitive and performance factors. Our results show that individual differences in achievement in school mathematics are related to individual differences in the acuity of an evolutionarily ancient, unlearned approximate number sense. Further research will determine whether early differences in number sense acuity affect later maths learning, whether maths education enhances number sense acuity, and the extent to which tertiary factors can affect both.","[Halberda, Justin; Mazzocco, Michele M.

It is generally believed that intrinsic structural differences between axons and dendrites dictate the polarized localization of axonal and dendritic proteins(1). However, whether extracellular cues also instruct this process in vivo has not been explored. Here we show that the axon guidance cue UNC-6/netrin and its receptor UNC-5 act throughout development to exclude synaptic vesicle and active zone proteins from the dendrite of the Caenorhabditis elegans motor neuron DA9, which is proximal to a source of UNC- 6/ netrin. In unc- 6/ netrin and unc- 5 loss- of-function mutants, presynaptic components mislocalize to the DA9 dendrite. In addition, ectopically expressed UNC- 6/ netrin, acting through UNC- 5, is sufficient to exclude endogenous synapses from adjacent subcellular domains within the DA9 axon. Furthermore, this anti- synaptogenic activity is interchangeable with that of LIN- 44/ Wnt despite being transduced through different receptors, suggesting that extracellular cues such as netrin and Wnts not only guide axon navigation but also regulate the polarized accumulation of presynaptic components through local exclusion.","[Poon, Vivian Y.; Klassen, Matthew P.; Shen, Kang] Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Neurosci Program, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Shen, Kang] Stanford Univ, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Dept Biol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA","Shen, K (reprint author), Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Neurosci Program, 300 Pasteur Dr, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",kangshen@stanford.edu,,,W.

But critical molecular determinants responsible for facilitating an appropriate immune response - following infection with DNA and RNA viruses, for example - remain to be identified. Here we report the identification, following expression cloning, of a molecule ( STING; stimulator of interferon genes) that appears essential for effective innate immune signalling processes. It comprises five putative transmembrane regions, predominantly resides in the endoplasmic reticulum and is able to activate both NF-kappa B and IRF3 transcription pathways to induce expression of type I interferon (IFN-alpha and IFN-beta) and exert a potent anti- viral state following expression. In contrast, loss of STING rendered murine embryonic fibroblasts extremely susceptible to negative-stranded virus infection, including vesicular stomatitis virus. Further, STING ablation abrogated the ability of intracellular B-form DNA, as well as members of the herpesvirus family, to induce IFN-beta, but did not significantly affect the Toll- like receptor ( TLR) pathway. Yeast two- hybrid and co- immunoprecipitation studies indicated that STING interacts with RIG- I and with SSR2 ( also known as TRAP beta), which is a member of the translocon-associated protein ( TRAP) complex required for protein translocation across the endoplasmic reticulum membrane following translation(1,2.) Ablation by RNA interference of both TRAPb and translocon adaptor SEC61 beta was subsequently found to inhibit STING's ability to stimulate expression of IFN-beta. Thus, as well as identifying a regulator of innate immune signalling, our results imply a potential role for the translocon in innate signalling pathways activated by select viruses as well as intracellular DNA.","[Ishikawa, Hiroki; Barber, Glen N.] Univ Miami, Sch Med, Dept Med, Miami, FL 33136 USA; [Ishikawa, Hiroki; Barber, Glen N.] Univ Miami, Sch Med, Sylvester Comprehens Canc Ctr, Miami, FL 33136 USA","Barber, GN (reprint author), Univ Miami, Sch Med, Dept Med, Miami, FL 33136 USA.",gbarber@med.miami.edu,,,"NIAID NIH HHS [R01 AI079336, R01 AI079336-01]",,,25,747,785,15,105,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,2-Oct,2008,455,7213,,,,,674,U74,,10.1038/nature07317,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,354KY,WOS:000259639700049,18724357,No,Y,N,11/20/17

However, enthusiasm has been muted by lack of direct evidence that Myc inhibition would be therapeutically efficacious, concerns that it would induce serious side effects by inhibiting proliferation of normal tissues, and practical difficulties in designing Myc inhibitory drugs. We have modelled genetically both the therapeutic impact and the side effects of systemic Myc inhibition in a preclinical mouse model of Ras- induced lung adenocarcinoma by reversible, systemic expression of a dominant- interfering Myc mutant. We show that Myc inhibition triggers rapid regression of incipient and established lung tumours, defining an unexpected role for endogenous Myc function in the maintenance of Ras- dependent tumours in vivo. Systemic Myc inhibition also exerts profound effects on normal regenerating tissues. However, these effects are well tolerated over extended periods and rapidly and completely reversible.

Eukaryotic initiation factors ( eIFs) control translation at the rate- limiting step of initiation(1,2). So far, only two eIFs connect extracellular stimuli to global translation rates(3): eIF4E acts in the eIF4F complex and regulates binding of capped messenger RNA to 40S subunits, downstream of growth factors(4,5), and eIF2 controls loading of the ternary complex on the 40S subunit and is inhibited on stress stimuli(6,7). No eIFs have been found to link extracellular stimuli to the activity of the large 60S ribosomal subunit. eIF6 binds 60S ribosomes precluding ribosome joining in vitro(8-10). However, studies in yeasts showed that eIF6 is required for ribosome biogenesis rather than translation(11-14). Here we show that mammalian eIF6 is required for efficient initiation of translation, in vivo. eIF6 null embryos are lethal at preimplantation. Heterozygous mice have 50% reduction of eIF6 levels in all tissues, and show reduced mass of hepatic and adipose tissues due to a lower number of cells and to impaired G1/S cell cycle progression. eIF6(+/-) cells retain sufficient nucleolar eIF6 and normal ribosome biogenesis. The liver of eIF6(+/-) mice displays an increase of 80S in polysomal profiles, indicating a defect in initiation of translation. Consistently, isolated hepatocytes have impaired insulin- stimulated translation. Heterozygous mouse embryonic fibroblasts recapitulate the organism phenotype and have normal ribosome biogenesis, reduced insulin- stimulated translation, and delayed G1/S phase progression. Furthermore, eIF6(+/-) cells are resistant to oncogene- induced transformation. Thus, eIF6 is the first eIF associated with the large 60S subunit that regulates translation in response to extracellular signals.","[Gandin, Valentina; Miluzio, Annarita; Barbieri, Anna Maria; Beugnet, Anne; Marchisio, Pier Carlo; Biffo, Stefano] Ist Sci San Raffaele, Mol Histol & Cell Growth Lab, I-20132 Milan, Italy; [Kiyokawa, Hiroaki] Northwestern Univ, Feinberg Sch Med, Chicago, IL 60611 USA; [Marchisio, Pier Carlo] Univ Vita Salute, Sch Med, I-20132 Milan, Italy; [Biffo, Stefano] Univ Piemonte Orientale, DISAV, I-15100 Alessandria, Italy","Biffo, S (reprint author), Ist Sci San Raffaele, Mol Histol & Cell Growth Lab, Via Olgettina 58, I-20132 Milan, Italy.",stefano.biffo@hsr.it,,"biffo, stefano/0000-0002-3780-1050","AIRC [05-360]; TELETHON [GGB05043, CARIPLO, NIH-RO10578]","This work was supported by grants AIRC (S.B., P.C.M.), TELETHON GGB05043, CARIPLO 0578 (S.B.) and NIH-RO1 (H.K.).

HR is the most accurate DSB repair mechanism but is generally restricted to the S and G2 phases of the cell cycle, when DNA has been replicated and a sister chromatid is available as a repair template(2-5). By contrast, NHEJ operates throughout the cell cycle but assumes most importance in G1 ( refs 4, 6). The choice between repair pathways is governed by cyclindependent protein kinases (CDKs)(2,3,5,7), with a major site of control being at the level of DSB resection, an event that is necessary for HR but not NHEJ, and which takes place most effectively in S and G2 ( refs 2, 5). Here we establish that cell- cycle control of DSB resection in Saccharomyces cerevisiae results from the phosphorylation by CDK of an evolutionarily conserved motif in the Sae2 protein. We show that mutating Ser 267 of Sae2 to a non- phosphorylatable residue causes phenotypes comparable to those of a sae2 Delta null mutant, including hypersensitivity to camptothecin, defective sporulation, reduced hairpin- induced recombination, severely impaired DNA- end processing and faulty assembly and disassembly of HR factors. Furthermore, a Sae2 mutation that mimics constitutive Ser 267 phosphorylation complements these phenotypes and overcomes the necessity of CDK activity for DSB resection. The Sae2 mutations also cause cell- cycle- stage specific hypersensitivity to DNA damage and affect the balance between HR and NHEJ. These findings therefore provide amechanistic basis for cell- cycle control of DSB repair and highlight the importance of regulating DSB resection.","[Huertas, Pablo; Sartori, Alessandro A.; Jackson, Stephen P.] Univ Cambridge, Wellcome Trust & Canc Res UK Gurdon Inst, Cambridge CB2 1QN, England; [Huertas, Pablo; Sartori, Alessandro A.; Jackson, Stephen P.] Univ Cambridge, Dept Zool, Cambridge CB2 1QN, England; [Cortes-Ledesma, Felipe; Aguilera, Andres] Univ Seville, CSIC, Ctr Andaluz Biol Mol & Med Regenerat, CABIMER, Seville 41092, Spain","Jackson, SP (reprint author), Univ Cambridge, Wellcome Trust & Canc Res UK Gurdon Inst, Tennis Court Rd, Cambridge CB2 1QN, England.",s.jackson@gurdon.cam.ac.uk,"Cortes Ledesma, Felipe/F-4803-2014; Dry, Kate/I-2328-2014; Huertas, Pablo/N-2245-2016","Cortes Ledesma, Felipe/0000-0002-0440-6783; Huertas, Pablo/0000-0002-1756-4449; Jackson, Stephen Philip/0000-0001-9317-7937; Aguilera, Andres/0000-0003-4782-1714; Sartori, Alessandro/0000-0003-2770-0333","Long- Term EMBO Fellowship; Swiss National Foundation Grant; Cancer Research UK; European Community [LSHG-CT-2005-512113)]; Spanish Ministry of Science and Education [BFU2006-05, CDS2007-0015260]; Junta de Andalucia [CVI624]","We thank M.

The mature protease is active only as a dimer(3-5) with each subunit contributing catalytic residues(6). The full- length transframe region protease precursor appears to be monomeric yet undergoes maturation via intramolecular cleavage of a putative precursor dimer(5,7-11), concomitant with the appearance of mature- like catalytic activity(7,9). How such intramolecular cleavage can occur when the amino and carboxy termini of the mature protease are part of an intersubunit beta-sheet located distal from the active site is unclear. Here we visualize the early events in N- terminal autoprocessing using an inactive mini- precursor with a four- residue N- terminal extension that mimics the transframe region protease precursor(5,12). Using paramagnetic relaxation enhancement, a technique that is exquisitely sensitive to the presence of minor species(13-16), we show that the mini- precursor forms highly transient, lowly populated (3-5%) dimeric encounter complexes that involve the mature dimer interface but occupy a wide range of subunit orientations relative to the mature dimer. Furthermore, the occupancy of the mature dimer configuration constitutes a very small fraction of the self- associated species ( accounting for the very low enzymatic activity of the protease precursor), and the N- terminal extension makes transient intra- and intersubunit contacts with the substrate binding site and is therefore available for autocleavage when the correct dimer orientation is sampled within the encounter complex ensemble.","[Tang, Chun; Louis, John M.; Aniana, Annie; Suh, Jeong-Yong; Clore, G.

Here we show, using time- lapse microscopy, that Crz1 exhibits short bursts of nuclear localization ( typically lasting 2 min) that occur stochastically in individual cells and propagate to the expression of downstream genes. Strikingly, calcium concentration controls the frequency, but not the duration, of localization bursts. Using an analytic model, we also show that this frequency modulation of bursts ensures proportional expression of multiple target genes across a wide dynamic range of expression levels, independent of promoter characteristics. We experimentally confirm this theory with natural and synthetic Crz1 target promoters. Another stress- response transcription factor, Msn2, exhibits similar, but largely uncorrelated, localization bursts under calcium stress suggesting that frequency- modulation regulation of localization bursts may be a general control strategy used by the cell to coordinate multi- gene responses to external signals.","[Cai, Long; Dalal, Chiraj K.; Elowitz, Michael B.] CALTECH, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Div Biol, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA; [Cai, Long; Dalal, Chiraj K.; Elowitz, Michael B.] CALTECH, Dept Appl Phys, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA","Elowitz, MB (reprint author), CALTECH, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Div Biol, M-C 114-96, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA.",melowitz@caltech.edu,,"Dalal, Chiraj/0000-0002-3624-8409","Beckman Fellows Program at Caltech; National Institutes of Health [R01GM079771]; National Centers of Systems Biology, and the Packard Foundation [P50 GM068763]","We thank M.
