0,20,20,"The effective use of targeted therapy is highly dependent on the identification of responder patient populations. Loss of FBW7, which encodes a tumour-suppressor protein, is frequently found in various types of human cancer, including breast cancer, colon cancer(1) and T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (T-ALL)(2). In line with these genomic data, engineered deletion of Fbw7 in mouse T cells results in T-ALL(3-5), validating FBW7 as a T-ALL tumour suppressor. Determining the precise molecular mechanisms by which FBW7 exerts antitumour activity is an area of intensive investigation. These mechanisms are thought to relate in part to FBW7-mediated destruction of key proteins relevant to cancer, including Jun(6), Myc(7), cyclin E-8 and notch 1 (ref. 9), all of which have oncoprotein activity and are overexpressed in various human cancers, including leukaemia. In addition to accelerating cell growth(10), overexpression of Jun, Myc or notch 1 can also induce programmed cell death(11). Thus, considerable uncertainty surrounds how FBW7-deficient cells evade cell death in the setting of upregulated Jun, Myc and/or notch 1. Here we show that the E3 ubiquitin ligase SCFFBW7 (a SKP1-cullin-1-F-box complex that contains FBW7 as the F-box protein) governs cellular apoptosis by targeting MCL1, a pro-survival BCL2 family member, for ubiquitylation and destruction in a manner that depends on phosphorylation by glycogen synthase kinase 3. Human T-ALL cell lines showed a close relationship between FBW7 loss and MCL1 overexpression. Correspondingly, T-ALL cell lines with defective FBW7 are particularly sensitive to the multi-kinase inhibitor sorafenib but resistant to the BCL2 antagonist ABT-737. On the genetic level, FBW7 reconstitution or MCL1 depletion restores sensitivity to ABT-737, establishing MCL1 as a therapeutically relevant bypass survival mechanism that enables FBW7-deficient cells to evade apoptosis. Therefore, our work provides insight into the molecular mechanism of direct tumour suppression by FBW7 and has implications for the targeted treatment of patients with FBW7-deficient T-ALL.","Inuzuka, Hiroyuki; Shaik, Shavali; Onoyama, Ichiro; Gao, Daming; Tseng, Alan; Maser, Richard S.; Zhai, Bo; Wan, Lixin; Gutierrez, Alejandro; Lau, Alan W.; Xiao, Yonghong; Christie, Amanda L.; Aster, Jon; Settleman, Jeffrey; Gygi, Steven P.; Kung, Andrew L.; Look, Thomas; Nakayama, Keiichi I.; DePinho, Ronald A.; Wei, Wenyi","Inuzuka, H; Shaik, S; Onoyama, I; Gao, DM; Tseng, A; Maser, RS; Zhai, B; Wan, LX; Gutierrez, A; Lau, AW; Xiao, YH; Christie, AL; Aster, J; Settleman, J; Gygi, SP; Kung, AL; Look, T; Nakayama, KI; DePinho, RA; Wei, WY",104.0,"[Inuzuka, Hiroyuki; Shaik, Shavali; Gao, Daming; Tseng, Alan; Wan, Lixin; Lau, Alan W.; Wei, Wenyi] Harvard Univ, Beth Israel Deaconess Med Ctr, Sch Med, Dept Pathol, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Onoyama, Ichiro; Nakayama, Keiichi I.] Kyushu Univ, Dept Mol & Cellular Biol, Med Inst Bioregulat, Fukuoka 8128582, Japan; [Maser, Richard S.; Xiao, Yonghong; DePinho, Ronald A.] Harvard Univ, Belfer Inst Appl Canc Sci, Dana Farber Canc Inst, Dept Med Oncol,Sch Med, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Maser, Richard S.] Jackson Lab, Bar Harbor, ME 04609 USA; [Zhai, Bo; Gygi, Steven P.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Cell Biol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Gutierrez, Alejandro; Christie, Amanda L.; Kung, Andrew L.; Look, Thomas] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dana Farber Canc Inst, Dept Pediat Oncol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Christie, Amanda L.; Kung, Andrew L.] Dana Farber Canc Inst, Lurie Family Imaging Ctr, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Aster, Jon] Harvard Univ, Brigham & Womens Hosp, Sch Med, Dept Pathol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Settleman, Jeffrey] Harvard Univ, Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Sch Med, Ctr Canc,Dept Med, Boston, MA 02129 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature09732,Article,,wwei2@bidmc.harvard.edu,U128,Emerald Foundation; Leukemia and Lymphoma Society; National Institutes of Health [GM089763]; Robert A. and Renee E.

1,69,69,"Cell-fate transitions involve the integration of genomic information encoded by regulatory elements, such as enhancers, with the cellular environment(1,2). However, identification of genomic sequences that control human embryonic development represents a formidable challenge(3). Here we show that in human embryonic stem cells (hESCs), unique chromatin signatures identify two distinct classes of genomic elements, both of which are marked by the presence of chromatin regulators p300 and BRG1, monomethylation of histone H3 at lysine 4 (H3K4me1), and low nucleosomal density. In addition, elements of the first class are distinguished by the acetylation of histone H3 at lysine 27 (H3K27ac), overlap with previously characterized hESC enhancers, and are located proximally to genes expressed in hESCs and the epiblast. In contrast, elements of the second class, which we term 'poised enhancers', are distinguished by the absence of H3K27ac, enrichment of histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3), and are linked to genes inactive in hESCs and instead are involved in orchestrating early steps in embryogenesis, such as gastrulation, mesoderm formation and neurulation. Consistent with the poised identity, during differentiation of hESCs to neuroepithelium, a neuroectoderm-specific subset of poised enhancers acquires a chromatin signature associated with active enhancers. When assayed in zebrafish embryos, poised enhancers are able to direct cell-type and stage-specific expression characteristic of their proximal developmental gene, even in the absence of sequence conservation in the fish genome. Our data demonstrate that early developmental enhancers are epigenetically pre-marked in hESCs and indicate an unappreciated role of H3K27me3 at distal regulatory elements. Moreover, the wealth of new regulatory sequences identified here provides an invaluable resource for studies and isolation of transient, rare cell populations representing early stages of human embryogenesis.","Rada-Iglesias, Alvaro; Bajpai, Ruchi; Swigut, Tomek; Brugmann, Samantha A.; Flynn, Ryan A.; Wysocka, Joanna","Rada-Iglesias, A; Bajpai, R; Swigut, T; Brugmann, SA; Flynn, RA; Wysocka, J",279.0,"[Rada-Iglesias, Alvaro; Bajpai, Ruchi; Swigut, Tomek; Brugmann, Samantha A.; Flynn, Ryan A.; Wysocka, Joanna] Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Dept Chem & Syst Biol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Wysocka, Joanna] Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Dept Dev Biol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature09692,Article,,wysocka@stanford.edu,+,WM Keck Foundation; CIRM [RN1 00579-1]; EMBO,"We thank Wysocka laboratory members for ideas and manuscript comments; I.

2,102,102,"The essential mammalian enzyme O-linked beta-N-acetylglucosamine transferase (O-GlcNAc transferase, here OGT) couples metabolic status to the regulation of a wide variety of cellular signalling pathways by acting as a nutrient sensor(1). OGT catalyses the transfer of N-acetylglucosamine from UDP-N-acetylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc) to serines and threonines of cytoplasmic, nuclear and mitochondrial proteins(2,3), including numerous transcription factors(4), tumour suppressors, kinases(5), phosphatases(1) and histone-modifying proteins(6). Aberrant glycosylation by OGT has been linked to insulin resistance(7), diabetic complications(8), cancer(9) and neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's(10). Despite the importance of OGT, the details of how it recognizes and glycosylates its protein substrates are largely unknown. We report here two crystal structures of human OGT, as a binary complex with UDP (2.8 angstrom resolution) and as a ternary complex with UDP and a peptide substrate (1.95 angstrom). The structures provide clues to the enzyme mechanism, show how OGT recognizes target peptide sequences, and reveal the fold of the unique domain between the two halves of the catalytic region. This information will accelerate the rational design of biological experiments to investigate OGT's functions; it will also help the design of inhibitors for use as cellular probes and help to assess its potential as a therapeutic target.","Lazarus, Michael B.; Nam, Yunsun; Jiang, Jiaoyang; Sliz, Piotr; Walker, Suzanne","Lazarus, MB; Nam, YS; Jiang, JY; Sliz, P; Walker, S",564.0,"[Lazarus, Michael B.; Jiang, Jiaoyang; Walker, Suzanne] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Microbiol & Mol Genet, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Lazarus, Michael B.] Harvard Univ, Dept Chem & Chem Biol, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Nam, Yunsun; Sliz, Piotr] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Biol Chem & Mol Pharmacol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Nam, Yunsun; Sliz, Piotr] Childrens Hosp, Mol Med Lab, Boston, MA 02115 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature09638,Article,,piotr_sliz@hms.harvard.edu; suzanne_walker@hms.harvard.edu,U168,US National Institutes of Health; US National Science Foundation; Harvard Biomedical Accelerator Fund,"We thank B.

3,139,139,"Individuals make choices and prioritize goals using complex processes that assign value to rewards and associated stimuli. During Pavlovian learning, previously neutral stimuli that predict rewards can acquire motivational properties, becoming attractive and desirable incentive stimuli. However, whether a cue acts solely as a predictor of reward, or also serves as an incentive stimulus, differs between individuals. Thus, individuals vary in the degree to which cues bias choice and potentially promote maladaptive behaviour. Here we use rats that differ in the incentive motivational properties they attribute to food cues to probe the role of the neurotransmitter dopamine in stimulus-reward learning. We show that intact dopamine transmission is not required for all forms of learning in which reward cues become effective predictors. Rather, dopamine acts selectively in a form of stimulus-reward learning in which incentive salience is assigned to reward cues. In individuals with a propensity for this form of learning, reward cues come to powerfully motivate and control behaviour. This work provides insight into the neurobiology of a form of stimulus-reward learning that confers increased susceptibility to disorders of impulse control.","Flagel, Shelly B.; Clark, Jeremy J.; Robinson, Terry E.; Mayo, Leah; Czuj, Alayna; Willuhn, Ingo; Akers, Christina A.; Clinton, Sarah M.; Phillips, Paul E.

5,227,227,"Kinetochores are macromolecular machines that couple chromosomes to dynamic microtubule tips during cell division, thereby generating force to segregate the chromosomes(1,2). Accurate segregation depends on selective stabilization of correct 'bi-oriented' kinetochore-microtubule attachments, which come under tension as the result of opposing forces exerted by microtubules(3). Tension is thought to stabilize these bi-oriented attachments indirectly, by suppressing the destabilizing activity of a kinase, Aurora B(4,5). However, a complete mechanistic understanding of the role of tension requires reconstitution of kinetochore-microtubule attachments for biochemical and biophysical analyses in vitro. Here we show that native kinetochore particles retaining the majority of kinetochore proteins can be purified from budding yeast and used to reconstitute dynamic microtubule attachments. Individual kinetochore particles maintain load-bearing associations with assembling and disassembling ends of single microtubules for >30 min, providing a close match to the persistent coupling seen in vivo between budding yeast kinetochores and single microtubules(6). Moreover, tension increases the lifetimes of the reconstituted attachments directly, through a catch bond-like mechanism that does not require Aurora B(7-10). On the basis of these findings, we propose that tension selectively stabilizes proper kinetochore-microtubule attachments in vivo through a combination of direct mechanical stabilization and tension-dependent phosphoregulation.","Akiyoshi, Bungo; Sarangapani, Krishna K.; Powers, Andrew F.; Nelson, Christian R.; Reichow, Steve L.; Arellano-Santoyo, Hugo; Gonen, Tamir; Ranish, Jeffrey A.; Asbury, Charles L.; Biggins, Sue","Akiyoshi, B; Sarangapani, KK; Powers, AF; Nelson, CR; Reichow, SL; Arellano-Santoyo, H; Gonen, T; Ranish, JA; Asbury, CL; Biggins, S",576.0,"[Akiyoshi, Bungo; Nelson, Christian R.; Arellano-Santoyo, Hugo; Biggins, Sue] Fred Hutchinson Canc Res Ctr, Div Basic Sci, Seattle, WA 98109 USA; [Akiyoshi, Bungo; Arellano-Santoyo, Hugo] Univ Washington, Mol & Cellular Biol Program, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Sarangapani, Krishna K.; Powers, Andrew F.; Arellano-Santoyo, Hugo; Asbury, Charles L.] Univ Washington, Dept Physiol Biophys, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Reichow, Steve L.; Gonen, Tamir] Univ Washington, Dept Biochem, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Gonen, Tamir] Univ Washington, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Ranish, Jeffrey A.] Inst Syst Biol, Seattle, WA 98103 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature09594,Article,,casbury@u.washington.edu; sbiggins@fhcrc.org,U255,"NSF IGERT [DGE-0504573]; NIH [T32GM07270, T32HL007312, GM078069, GM064386]; NCI Cancer Center [CA015704]; NIGMS [PM50 GM076547, R01GM79373]; Searle Scholar Award [06-L-111]; Packard Fellowship for Science and Engineering [2006-30521]","We thank A.

7,259,259,"Aneuploidy, referring here to genome contents characterized by abnormal numbers of chromosomes, has been associated with developmental defects, cancer and adaptive evolution in experimental organisms(1-9). However, it remains unresolved how aneuploidy impacts gene expression and whether aneuploidy could directly bring about phenotypic variation and improved fitness over that of euploid counterparts. Here we show, using quantitative mass spectrometry-based proteomics and phenotypic profiling, that levels of protein expression in aneuploid yeast strains largely scale with chromosome copy numbers, following the same trend as that observed for the transcriptome, and that aneuploidy confers diverse phenotypes. We designed a novel scheme to generate, through random meiotic segregation, 38 stable and fully isogenic aneuploid yeast strains with distinct karyotypes and genome contents between 1N and 3N without involving any genetic selection. Through quantitative growth assays under various conditions or in the presence of a panel of chemotherapeutic or antifungal drugs, we found that some aneuploid strains grew significantly better than euploid control strains under conditions suboptimal for the latter. These results provide strong evidence that aneuploidy directly affects gene expression at both the transcriptome and proteome levels and can generate significant phenotypic variation that could bring about fitness gains under diverse conditions. Our findings suggest that the fitness ranking between euploid and aneuploid cells is dependent on context and karyotype, providing the basis for the notion that aneuploidy can directly underlie phenotypic evolution and cellular adaptation.","Pavelka, Norman; Rancati, Giulia; Zhu, Jin; Bradford, William D.; Saraf, Anita; Florens, Laurence; Sanderson, Brian W.; Hattem, Gaye L.; Li, Rong","Pavelka, N; Rancati, G; Zhu, J; Bradford, WD; Saraf, A; Florens, L; Sanderson, BW; Hattem, GL; Li, R",321.0,"[Pavelka, Norman; Rancati, Giulia; Zhu, Jin; Bradford, William D.; Saraf, Anita; Florens, Laurence; Sanderson, Brian W.; Hattem, Gaye L.; Li, Rong] Stowers Inst Med Res, Kansas City, MO 64110 USA; [Li, Rong] Univ Kansas, Med Ctr, Dept Mol & Integrat Physiol, Kansas City, KS 66160 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature09529,Article,1476-4687,rli@stowers.org,325,NIH [RO1GM059964],"We thank C.

9,305,305,"There is disagreement about whether human political evolution has proceeded through a sequence of incremental increases in complexity, or whether larger, non-sequential increases have occurred. The extent to which societies have decreased in complexity is also unclear. These debates have continued largely in the absence of rigorous, quantitative tests. We evaluated six competing models of political evolution in Austronesian-speaking societies using phylogenetic methods. Here we show that in the best-fitting model political complexity rises and falls in a sequence of small steps. This is closely followed by another model in which increases are sequential but decreases can be either sequential or in bigger drops. The results indicate that large, non-sequential jumps in political complexity have not occurred during the evolutionary history of these societies. This suggests that, despite the numerous contingent pathways of human history, there are regularities in cultural evolution that can be detected using computational phylogenetic methods.","Currie, Thomas E.; Greenhill, Simon J.; Gray, Russell D.; Hasegawa, Toshikazu; Mace, Ruth","Currie, TE; Greenhill, SJ; Gray, RD; Hasegawa, T; Mace, R",801.0,"[Currie, Thomas E.; Hasegawa, Toshikazu] Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Arts & Sci, Evolutionary Cognit Sci Res Ctr, Tokyo 1538902, Japan; [Currie, Thomas E.; Mace, Ruth] UCL, Dept Anthropol, Human Evolutionary Ecol Grp, London WC1H 0BW, England; [Greenhill, Simon J.; Gray, Russell D.] Univ Auckland, Dept Psychol, Auckland 1142, New Zealand; [Greenhill, Simon J.] Univ Auckland, Computat Evolut Grp, Auckland 1142, New Zealand",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature09461,Article,,t.currie@ucl.ac.uk,804,ESRC/NERC; Japan Society for the Promotion of Science; Royal Society of New Zealand; European Research Council,"We thank R.

10,306,306,"The Ndc80 complex is a key site of regulated kinetochore-microtubule attachment (a process required for cell division), but the molecular mechanism underlying its function remains unknown. Here we present a subnanometre-resolution cryo-electron microscopy reconstruction of the human Ndc80 complex bound to microtubules, sufficient for precise docking of crystal structures of the component proteins. We find that the Ndc80 complex binds the microtubule with a tubulin monomer repeat, recognizing alpha- and beta-tubulin at both intra-and inter-tubulin dimer interfaces in a manner that is sensitive to tubulin conformation. Furthermore, Ndc80 complexes self-associate along protofilaments through interactions mediated by the amino-terminal tail of the NDC80 protein, which is the site of phospho-regulation by Aurora B kinase. The complex's mode of interaction with the microtubule and its oligomerization suggest a mechanism by which Aurora B could regulate the stability of load-bearing kinetochore-microtubule attachments.","Alushin, Gregory M.; Ramey, Vincent H.; Pasqualato, Sebastiano; Ball, David A.; Grigorieff, Nikolaus; Musacchio, Andrea; Nogales, Eva","Alushin, GM; Ramey, VH; Pasqualato, S; Ball, DA; Grigorieff, N; Musacchio, A; Nogales, E",805.0,"[Ball, David A.; Nogales, Eva] Univ Calif Berkeley, Lawrence Berkeley Lab, Div Life Sci, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Alushin, Gregory M.; Ramey, Vincent H.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Biophys Grad Grp, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Pasqualato, Sebastiano; Musacchio, Andrea] European Inst Oncol, Dept Expt Oncol, I-20139 Milan, Italy; [Grigorieff, Nikolaus] Brandeis Univ, Rosenstiel Basic Med Res Ctr, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Waltham, MA 02453 USA; [Musacchio, Andrea] Italian Inst Technol, Res Unit, I-20139 Milan, Italy; [Nogales, Eva] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mol & Cell Biol, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature09423,Article,,enogales@lbl.gov,U68,National Institute of General Medical Sciences,"We are grateful to K.

12,415,415,"Observations of distant quasars indicate that supermassive black holes of billions of solar masses already existed less than a billion years after the Big Bang(1). Models in which the 'seeds' of such black holes form by the collapse of primordial metal-free stars(2,3) cannot explain the rapid appearance of these supermassive black holes because gas accretion is not sufficiently efficient(4-6). Alternatively, these black holes may form by direct collapse of gas within isolated protogalaxies(7,8), but current models require idealized conditions, such as metal-free gas, to prevent cooling and star formation from consuming the gas reservoir(9-11). Here we report simulations showing that mergers between massive protogalaxies naturally produce the conditions for direct collapse into a supermassive black hole with no need to suppress cooling and star formation. Merger-driven gas inflows give rise to an unstable, massive nuclear gas disk of a few billion solar masses, which funnels more than 10(8) solar masses of gas to a sub-parsec-scale gas cloud in only 100,000 years. The cloud undergoes gravitational collapse, which eventually leads to the formation of a massive black hole. The black hole can subsequently grow to a billion solar masses on timescales of about 10(8) years by accreting gas from the surrounding disk.","Mayer, L.; Kazantzidis, S.; Escala, A.; Callegari, S.","Mayer, L; Kazantzidis, S; Escala, A; Callegari, S",1082.0,"[Mayer, L.; Callegari, S.] Univ Zurich, Inst Theoret Phys, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland; [Kazantzidis, S.] Ohio State Univ, Ctr Cosmol & Astroparticle Phys, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Kazantzidis, S.] Ohio State Univ, Dept Phys, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Kazantzidis, S.] Ohio State Univ, Dept Astron, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Escala, A.] Univ Chile, Dept Astron, Santiago 7550000, Chile; [Escala, A.] Stanford Univ, KIPAC, Menlo Pk, CA 94025 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature09294,Article,,lmayer@physik.unizh.ch,1084,Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF); Center for Cosmology and Astro Particle Physics (CCAPP) at Ohio State University; Kavli Institute for Particle Astrophysics (KIPAC) at Stanford University,"We thank M.

13,477,477,"The spatiotemporal behaviour of earthquakes within continental plate interiors is different from that at plate boundaries. At plate margins, tectonic motions quickly reload earthquake ruptures, making the location of recent earthquakes and the average time between them consistent with the faults' geological, palaeoseismic and seismic histories. In contrast, what determines the activation of a particular mid-continental fault and controls the duration of its seismic activity remains poorly understood(1). Here we argue that the concentration of magnitude-7 or larger earthquakes in the New Madrid seismic zone of the central United States(2,3) since the end of the last ice age results from the recent, climate-controlled, erosional history of the northern Mississippi embayment. We show that the upward flexure of the lithosphere caused by unloading from river incision between 16,000 and 10,000 years ago caused a reduction of normal stresses in the upper crust sufficient to unclamp preexisting faults close to failure equilibrium. Models indicate that fault segments that have already ruptured are unlikely to fail again soon, but stress changes from sediment unloading and previous earthquakes may eventually be sufficient to bring to failure other nearby segments that have not yet ruptured.","Calais, E.; Freed, A.

14,510,10,"The autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are a group of conditions characterized by impairments in reciprocal social interaction and communication, and the presence of restricted and repetitive behaviours(1). Individuals with an ASD vary greatly in cognitive development, which can range from above average to intellectual disability(2). Although ASDs are known to be highly heritable (similar to 90%)(3), the underlying genetic determinants are still largely unknown. Here we analysed the genome-wide characteristics of rare (<1% frequency) copy number variation in ASD using dense genotyping arrays. When comparing 996 ASD individuals of European ancestry to 1,287 matched controls, cases were found to carry a higher global burden of rare, genic copy number variants (CNVs) (1.19 fold, P=0.012), especially so for loci previously implicated in either ASD and/or intellectual disability (1.69 fold, P=3.4 x 10(-4)). Among the CNVs there were numerous de novo and inherited events, sometimes in combination in a given family, implicating many novel ASD genes such as SHANK2, SYNGAP1, DLGAP2 and the X-linked DDX53-PTCHD1 locus. We also discovered an enrichment of CNVs disrupting functional gene sets involved in cellular proliferation, projection and motility, and GTPase/Ras signalling. Our results reveal many new genetic and functional targets in ASD that may lead to final connected pathways.","Pinto, Dalila; Pagnamenta, Alistair T.; Klei, Lambertus; Anney, Richard; Merico, Daniele; Regan, Regina; Conroy, Judith; Magalhaes, Tiago R.; Correia, Catarina; Abrahams, Brett S.; Almeida, Joana; Bacchelli, Elena; Bader, Gary D.; Bailey, Anthony J.; Baird, Gillian; Battaglia, Agatino; Berney, Tom; Bolshakova, Nadia; Boelte, Sven; Bolton, Patrick F.; Bourgeron, Thomas; Brennan, Sean; Brian, Jessica; Bryson, Susan E.; Carson, Andrew R.; Casallo, Guillermo; Casey, Jillian; Chung, Brian H.

15,513,13,"The plasticity of ageing suggests that longevity may be controlled epigenetically by specific alterations in chromatin state. The link between chromatin and ageing has mostly focused on histone deacetylation by the Sir2 family(1,2), but less is known about the role of other histone modifications in longevity. Histone methylation has a crucial role in development and in maintaining stem cell pluripotency in mammals(3). Regulators of histone methylation have been associated with ageing in worms(4-7) and flies(8), but characterization of their role and mechanism of action has been limited. Here we identify the ASH-2 trithorax complex(9), which trimethylates histone H3 at lysine 4 (H3K4), as a regulator of lifespan in Caenorhabditis elegans in a directed RNA interference (RNAi) screen in fertile worms. Deficiencies in members of the ASH-2 complex-ASH-2 itself, WDR-5 and the H3K4 methyltransferase SET-2-extend worm lifespan. Conversely, the H3K4 demethylase RBR-2 is required for normal lifespan, consistent with the idea that an excess of H3K4 trimethylation-a mark associated with active chromatin is detrimental for longevity. Lifespan extension induced by ASH-2 complex deficiency requires the presence of an intact adult germline and the continuous production of mature eggs. ASH-2 and RBR-2 act in the germline, at least in part, to regulate lifespan and to control a set of genes involved in lifespan determination. These results indicate that the longevity of the soma is regulated by an H3K4 methyltransferase/demethylase complex acting in the C. elegans germline.","Greer, Eric L.; Maures, Travis J.; Hauswirth, Anna G.; Green, Erin M.; Leeman, Dena S.; Maro, Geraldine S.; Han, Shuo; Banko, Max R.; Gozani, Or; Brunet, Anne","Greer, EL; Maures, TJ; Hauswirth, AG; Green, EM; Leeman, DS; Maro, GS; Han, S; Banko, MR; Gozani, O; Brunet, A",383.0,"[Greer, Eric L.; Maures, Travis J.; Hauswirth, Anna G.; Leeman, Dena S.; Han, Shuo; Banko, Max R.; Brunet, Anne] Stanford Univ, Dept Genet, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Greer, Eric L.; Leeman, Dena S.; Gozani, Or; Brunet, Anne] Stanford Univ, Canc Biol Grad Program, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Green, Erin M.; Maro, Geraldine S.; Gozani, Or] Stanford Univ, Dept Biol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Maro, Geraldine S.] Stanford Univ, Dept Pathol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature09195,Article,,anne.brunet@stanford.edu,U137,"NIH [R01-AG31198, T32-CA009302, ARRA-AG31198, T32-HG000044, F31-AG032837]; NSF; Stanford graduate fellowship; Human Frontier Science Program post-doctoral fellowship; Searle Scholar award","We are grateful to A.

18,678,178,"The detection of water and the regulation of water intake are essential for animals to maintain proper osmotic homeostasis(1). Drosophila and other insects have gustatory sensory neurons that mediate the recognition of external water sources(2-4), but little is known about the underlying molecular mechanism for water taste detection. Here we identify a member of the degenerin/epithelial sodium channel family(5), PPK28, as an osmosensitive ion channel that mediates the cellular and behavioural response to water. We use molecular, cellular, calcium imaging and electrophysiological approaches to show that ppk28 is expressed in water-sensing neurons, and that loss of ppk28 abolishes water sensitivity. Moreover, ectopic expression of ppk28 confers water sensitivity to bitter-sensing gustatory neurons in the fly and sensitivity to hypoosmotic solutions when expressed in heterologous cells. These studies link an osmosensitive ion channel to water taste detection and drinking behaviour, providing the framework for examining the molecular basis for water detection in other animals.","Cameron, Peter; Hiroi, Makoto; Ngai, John; Scott, Kristin","Cameron, P; Hiroi, M; Ngai, J; Scott, K",91.0,"[Scott, Kristin] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mol & Cell Biol, Helen Wills Neurosci Inst, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Ngai, John] Univ Calif Berkeley, Funct Genom Lab, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Scott, Kristin] Univ Calif Berkeley, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature09011,Article,,kscott@berkeley.edu,U101,NIH (NIDCD); Burroughs-Wellcome CAREER Award; John Merck Award; NIH,"We thank K.

21,843,343,"The early evolutionary history of Ornithodira (avian-line archosaurs) has hitherto been documented by incomplete (Lagerpeton(1)) or unusually specialized forms (pterosaurs and Silesaurus(2)). Recently, a variety of Silesaurus-like taxa have been reported from the Triassic period of both Gondwana and Laurasia, but their relationships to each other and to dinosaurs remain a subject of debate(3-5). Here we report on a new avian-line archosaur from the early Middle Triassic (Anisian) of Tanzania. Phylogenetic analysis places Asilisaurus kongwe gen. et sp. nov. as an avian-line archosaur and a member of the Silesauridae, which is here considered the sister taxon to Dinosauria. Silesaurids were diverse and had a wide distribution by the Late Triassic, with a novel ornithodiran bauplan including leaf-shaped teeth, a beak-like lower jaw, long, gracile limbs, and a quadrupedal stance. Our analysis suggests that the dentition and diet of silesaurids, ornithischians and sauropodomorphs evolved independently from a plesiomorphic carnivorous form. As the oldest avian-line archosaur, Asilisaurus demonstrates the antiquity of both Ornithodira and the dinosaurian lineage. The initial diversification of Archosauria, previously documented by crocodilian-line archosaurs in the Anisian(6), can now be shown to include a contemporaneous avian-line radiation. The unparalleled taxonomic diversity of the Manda archosaur assemblage indicates that archosaur diversification was well underway by the Middle Triassic or earlier.","Nesbitt, Sterling J.; Sidor, Christian A.; Irmis, Randall B.; Angielczyk, Kenneth D.; Smith, Roger M.

22,848,348,"Haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), responsible for blood production in the adult mouse, are first detected in the dorsal aorta starting at embryonic day 10.5 (E10.5)(1-3). Immunohistological analysis of fixed embryo sections has revealed the presence of haematopoietic cell clusters attached to the aortic endothelium where HSCs might localize(4-6). The origin of HSCs has long been controversial and several candidates of the direct HSC precursors have been proposed (for review see ref. 7), including a specialized endothelial cell population with a haemogenic potential. Such cells have been described both in vitro in the embryonic stem cell (ESC) culture system(8,9) and retrospectively in vivo by endothelial lineage tracing(5,10) and conditional deletion experiments(11). Whether the transition from haemogenic endothelium to HSC actually occurs in the mouse embryonic aorta is still unclear and requires direct and real-time in vivo observation. To address this issue we used time-lapse confocal imaging and a new dissection procedure to visualize the deeply located aorta. Here we show the dynamic de novo emergence of phenotypically defined HSCs (Sca1(+), c-kit(+), CD41(+)) directly from ventral aortic haemogenic endothelial cells.","Boisset, Jean-Charles; van Cappellen, Wiggert; Andrieu-Soler, Charlotte; Galjart, Niels; Dzierzak, Elaine; Robin, Catherine","Boisset, JC; van Cappellen, W; Andrieu-Soler, C; Galjart, N; Dzierzak, E; Robin, C",116.0,"[Boisset, Jean-Charles; Andrieu-Soler, Charlotte; Galjart, Niels; Dzierzak, Elaine; Robin, Catherine] Erasmus MC, Dept Cell Biol, NL-3000 CA Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Boisset, Jean-Charles; Dzierzak, Elaine; Robin, Catherine] Erasmus MC, Erasmus Stem Cell Inst, NL-3000 CA Rotterdam, Netherlands; [van Cappellen, Wiggert] Erasmus MC, Dept Reprod & Dev, NL-3000 CA Rotterdam, Netherlands",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature08764,Article,,c.robin@erasmusmc.nl,U131,NWO [917-76-345]; NIH [R37 DKO54077]; BSIK [SCDD 03038],"We thank F.

23,878,378,"Heterozygous mutations in the gene encoding the CHD (chromo-domain helicase DNA-binding domain) member CHD7, an ATP-dependent chromatin remodeller homologous to the Drosophila trithorax-group protein Kismet(1,2), result in a complex constellation of congenital anomalies called CHARGE syndrome, which is a sporadic, autosomal dominant disorder characterized by malformations of the craniofacial structures, peripheral nervous system, ears, eyes and heart(3,4). Although it was postulated 25 years ago that CHARGE syndrome results from the abnormal development of the neural crest, this hypothesis remained untested(5). Here we show that, in both humans and Xenopus, CHD7 is essential for the formation of multipotent migratory neural crest (NC), a transient cell population that is ectodermal in origin but undergoes a major transcriptional reprogramming event to acquire a remarkably broad differentiation potential and ability to migrate throughout the body, giving rise to craniofacial bones and cartilages, the peripheral nervous system, pigmentation and cardiac structures(6,7). We demonstrate that CHD7 is essential for activation of the NC transcriptional circuitry, including Sox9, Twist and Slug. In Xenopus embryos, knockdown of Chd7 or overexpression of its catalytically inactive form recapitulates all major features of CHARGE syndrome. In human NC cells CHD7 associates with PBAF (polybromo-and BRG1-associated factor-containing complex) 8 and both remodellers occupy a NC-specific distal SOX9 enhancer(9) and a conserved genomic element located upstream of the TWIST1 gene. Consistently, during embryogenesis CHD7 and PBAF cooperate to promote NC gene expression and cell migration. Our work identifies an evolutionarily conserved role for CHD7 in orchestrating NC gene expression programs, provides insights into the synergistic control of distal elements by chromatin remodellers, illuminates the pathoembryology of CHARGE syndrome, and suggests a broader function for CHD7 in the regulation of cell motility.","Bajpai, Ruchi; Chen, Denise A.; Rada-Iglesias, Alvaro; Zhang, Junmei; Xiong, Yiqin; Helms, Jill; Chang, Ching-Pin; Zhao, Yingming; Swigut, Tomek; Wysocka, Joanna","Bajpai, R; Chen, DA; Rada-Iglesias, A; Zhang, JM; Xiong, YQ; Helms, J; Chang, CP; Zhao, YM; Swigut, T; Wysocka, J",958.0,"[Bajpai, Ruchi; Chen, Denise A.; Rada-Iglesias, Alvaro; Swigut, Tomek; Wysocka, Joanna] Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Dept Chem & Syst Biol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Xiong, Yiqin] Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Dept Med, Div Cardiovasc Med, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Helms, Jill; Chang, Ching-Pin] Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Dept Surg, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Wysocka, Joanna] Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Dept Dev Biol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Zhang, Junmei] Univ Texas SW Med Ctr Dallas, Prot Chem Technol Ctr, Dallas, TX 75390 USA; [Zhao, Yingming] Univ Chicago, Ben May Dept Canc Res, Chicago, IL 60637 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature08733,Article,,wysocka@stanford.edu,U135,"CIRM SEED [RS1-00323]; Keck Foundation; Searle Scholar Award; EMBO; National Institutes of Health (NIH) [R01DK082664, R01HL085345]; March of Dimes [6-FY06-335]; Oak Foundation","We thank laboratory members for input during the course of this work; S.

24,912,412,"Energy landscape theory is a powerful tool for understanding the structure and dynamics of complex molecular systems, in particular biological macromolecules(1). The primary sequence of a protein defines its free-energy landscape and thus determines the folding pathway and the rate constants of folding and unfolding, as well as the protein's native structure. Theory has shown that roughness in the energy landscape will lead to slower folding(1), but derivation of detailed experimental descriptions of this landscape is challenging. Simple folding models(2,3) show that folding is significantly influenced by chain entropy; proteins in which the contacts are local fold quickly, owing to the low entropy cost of forming stabilizing, native contacts during folding(4,5). For some protein families, stability is also a determinant of folding rate constants(6). Where these simple metrics fail to predict folding behaviour, it is probable that there are features in the energy landscape that are unusual. Such general observations cannot explain the folding behaviour of the R15, R16 and R17 domains of alpha-spectrin. R15 folds similar to 3,000 times faster than its homologues, although they have similar structures, stabilities and, as far as can be determined, transition-state stabilities(7-10). Here we show that landscape roughness (internal friction) is responsible for the slower folding and unfolding of R16 and R17. We use chimaeric domains to demonstrate that this internal friction is a property of the core, and suggest that frustration in the landscape of the slow-folding spectrin domains may be due to misdocking of the long helices during folding. Theoretical studies have suggested that rugged landscapes will result in slower folding; here we show experimentally that such a phenomenon directly influences the folding kinetics of a 'normal' protein, that is, one with a significant energy barrier that folds on a relatively slow, millisecond-second, timescale.","Wensley, Beth G.; Batey, Sarah; Bone, Fleur A.

25,1148,148,"The main asteroid belt lies between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter, but the region is not uniformly filled with asteroids. There are gaps, known as the Kirkwood gaps, in distinct locations that are associated with orbital resonances with the giant planets(1); asteroids placed in these locations will follow chaotic orbits and be removed(2). Here we show that the observed distribution of main belt asteroids does not fill uniformly even those regions that are dynamically stable over the age of the Solar System. We find a pattern of excess depletion of asteroids, particularly just outward of the Kirkwood gaps associated with the 5:2, the 7:3 and the 2:1 Jovian resonances. These features are not accounted for by planetary perturbations in the current structure of the Solar System, but are consistent with dynamical ejection of asteroids by the sweeping of gravitational resonances during the migration of Jupiter and Saturn similar to 4 Gyr ago.","Minton, David A.; Malhotra, Renu","Minton, DA; Malhotra, R",1109.0,"[Minton, David A.; Malhotra, Renu] Univ Arizona, Lunar & Planetary Lab, Tucson, AZ 85716 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature07778,Article,,daminton@lpl.arizona.edu,1111,NASA; NSF,We acknowledge research funding from NASA and NSF.,411VI,,,LATE HEAVY BOMBARDMENT; SOLAR-SYSTEM; ORIGIN; NEPTUNE; URANUS; ORBIT,7233.0,NATURE,Nature,English,20.0,No,"Malhotra, Renu/0000-0002-1226-3305","MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",26-Feb,3.0,LONDON,19242470.0,J,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2009.0,,"Minton, DA (reprint author), Univ Arizona, Lunar & Planetary Lab, 1629 E Univ Blvd, Tucson, AZ 85716 USA.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,0028-0836,NATURE,76.0,A record of planet migration in the main asteroid belt,1.0,4.0,WOS:000263680100035,148.0,457,Multidisciplinary Sciences,76,renu,malhotra,6441.0,39,female,1.0,oNbBPbsAAAAJ,3,"(4126, 9345]",1643298,1
26,1150,150,"Macroscopic laws of friction do not generally apply to nanoscale contacts. Although continuum mechanics models have been predicted to break down at the nanoscale(1), they continue to be applied for lack of a better theory. An understanding of how friction force depends on applied load and contact area at these scales is essential for the design of miniaturized devices with optimal mechanical performance(2,3). Here we use large-scale molecular dynamics simulations with realistic force fields to establish friction laws in dry nanoscale contacts. We show that friction force depends linearly on the number of atoms that chemically interact across the contact. By defining the contact area as being proportional to this number of interacting atoms, we show that the macroscopically observed linear relationship between friction force and contact area can be extended to the nanoscale. Our model predicts that as the adhesion between the contacting surfaces is reduced, a transition takes place from nonlinear to linear dependence of friction force on load. This transition is consistent with the results of several nanoscale friction experiments(4-7). We demonstrate that the breakdown of continuum mechanics can be understood as a result of the rough (multi-asperity) nature of the contact, and show that roughness theories(8-10) of friction can be applied at the nanoscale.","Mo, Yifei; Turner, Kevin T.; Szlufarska, Izabela","Mo, YF; Turner, KT; Szlufarska, I",1116.0,"[Mo, Yifei; Turner, Kevin T.; Szlufarska, Izabela] Univ Wisconsin, Mat Sci Program, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Turner, Kevin T.] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Mech Engn, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Turner, Kevin T.; Szlufarska, Izabela] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Madison, WI 53706 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature07748,Article,,izabela@engr.wisc.edu,1119,National Science Foundation [DMR-0512228]; American Chemical Society [PRF-47978-G5],We thank D.

30,1250,250,"The overall fidelity of protein synthesis has been thought to rely on the combined accuracy of two basic processes: the aminoacylation of transfer RNAs with their cognate amino acid by the aminoacyl- tRNA synthetases, and the selection of cognate aminoacyl- tRNAs by the ribosome in cooperation with the GTPase elongation factor EF- Tu. These two processes, which together ensure the specific acceptance of a correctly charged cognate tRNA into the aminoacyl ( A) site, operate before peptide bond formation. Here we report the identification of an additional mechanism that contributes to high fidelity protein synthesis after peptidyl transfer, using a well- defined in vitro bacterial translation system. In this retrospective quality control step, the incorporation of an amino acid from a non- cognate tRNA into the growing polypeptide chain leads to a general loss of specificity in the A site of the ribosome, and thus to a propagation of errors that results in abortive termination of protein synthesis.","Zaher, Hani S.; Green, Rachel","Zaher, HS; Green, R",161.0,"[Zaher, Hani S.; Green, Rachel] Johns Hopkins Univ, Sch Med, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Dept Mol Biol & Genet, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature07582,Article,,ragreen@jhmi.edu,U51,National Institutes of Health; Howard Hughes Medical Institute.,"We thank B.

32,1302,302,"The role of conformational changes in explaining the huge catalytic power of enzymes is currently one of the most challenging questions in biology(1-7). Although it is now widely regarded that enzymes modulate reaction rates by means of short- and long- range protein motions(3-7), it is almost impossible to distinguish between conformational changes and catalysis. We have solved this problem using the chlorophyll biosynthetic enzyme NADPH: protochlorophyllide ( Pchlide) oxidoreductase, which catalyses a unique light- driven reaction involving hydride and proton transfers(8). Here we report that prior excitation of the enzyme- substrate complex with a laser pulse induces a more favourable conformation of the active site, enabling the coupled hydride and proton transfer reactions to occur. This effect, which is triggered during the Pchlide excited-state lifetime and persists on a long timescale, switches the enzyme into an active state characterized by a high rate and quantum yield of formation of a catalytic intermediate. The corresponding spectral changes in the mid- infrared following the absorption of one photon reveal significant conformational changes in the enzyme, illustrating the importance of flexibility and dynamics in the structure of enzymes for their function.","Sytina, Olga A.; Heyes, Derren J.; Hunter, C.

33,1311,311,"Recent observations of the extrasolar planet HD189733b did not reveal the presence of water in the emission spectrumof the planet(1). Yet models of such 'hot- Jupiter' planets predict an abundance of atmospheric water vapour(2). Validating and constraining these models is crucial to understanding the physics and chemistry of planetary atmospheres in extreme environments. Indications of the presence of water in the atmosphere of HD189733b have recently been found in transmission spectra(3,4), where the planet's atmosphere selectively absorbs the light of the parent star, and in broadband photometry(5). Here we report the detection of strong water absorption in a high- signal- to- noise, mid- infrared emission spectrumof the planet itself. We find both a strong downturn in the flux ratio below 10 mu m and discrete spectral features that are characteristic of strong absorption by water vapour. The differences between these and previous observations are significant and admit the possibility that predicted planetary- scale dynamical weather structures(6) may alter the emission spectrum over time. Models that match the observed spectrum and the broadband photometry suggest that heat redistribution from the dayside to the nightside is weak.

34,1371,371,"In all animals, the initial events of embryogenesis are controlled by maternal gene products that are deposited into the developing oocyte. At some point after fertilization, control of embryogenesis is transferred to the zygotic genome in a process called the maternal- to-zygotic transition. During this time, many maternal RNAs are degraded and transcription of zygotic RNAs ensues(1). There is a long-standing question as to which factors regulate these events. The recent findings that microRNAs(2,3) and Smaug(4) mediate maternal transcript degradation have shed new light on this aspect of the problem. However, the transcription factor(s) that activate the zygotic genomeremain elusive. The discovery that many of the early transcribed genes in Drosophila share a cis- regulatory heptamer motif, CAGGTAG and related sequences(5,6), collectively referred to as TAGteam sites(5) raised the possibility that a dedicated transcription factor could interact with these sites to activate transcription. Here we report that the zinc- finger protein Zelda ( Zld; Zinc- finger early Drosophila activator) binds specifically to these sites and is capable of activating transcription in transient transfection assays. Mutant embryos lacking zld are defective in cellular blastoderm formation, and fail to activate many genes essential for cellularization, sex determination and pattern formation. Global expression profiling confirmed that Zld has an important role in the activation of the early zygotic genome and suggests that Zld may also regulate maternal RNA degradation during the maternal- to- zygotic transition.","Liang, Hsiao-Lan; Nien, Chung-Yi; Liu, Hsiao-Yun; Metzstein, Mark M.; Kirov, Nikolai; Rushlow, Christine","Liang, HL; Nien, CY; Liu, HY; Metzstein, MM; Kirov, N; Rushlow, C",400.0,"[Liang, Hsiao-Lan; Nien, Chung-Yi; Liu, Hsiao-Yun; Kirov, Nikolai; Rushlow, Christine] NYU, Dept Biol, New York, NY 10003 USA; [Metzstein, Mark M.] Univ Utah, Inst Human Genet, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature07388,Article,,chris.rushlow@nyu.edu,U67,National Institutes of Health [GM63024],"We thank the following people for gifts of RNA probes, plasmids, antibodies and fly stocks: J.

35,1388,388,"Although the cochlea is an amplifier and a remarkably sensitive and finely tuned detector of sounds, it also produces conspicuous mechanical and electrical waveform distortions(1). These distortions reflect nonlinear mechanical interactions within the cochlea. By allowing one tone to suppress another ( masking effect), they contribute to speech intelligibility(2). Tones can also combine to produce sounds with frequencies not present in the acoustic stimulus(3). These sounds compose the otoacoustic emissions that are extensively used to screen hearing in newborns. Because both cochlear amplification and distortion originate from the outer hair cells - one of the two types of sensory receptor cells - it has been speculated that they stem from a common mechanism. Here we show that the nonlinearity underlying cochlear waveform distortions relies on the presence of stereocilin, a protein defective in a recessive form of human deafness(4). Stereocilin was detected in association with horizontal top connectors(5-7), lateral links that join adjacent stereocilia within the outer hair cell's hair bundle. These links were absent in stereocilin- null mutant mice, which became progressively deaf. At the onset of hearing, however, their cochlear sensitivity and frequency tuning were almost normal, although masking was much reduced and both acoustic and electrical waveform distortions were completely lacking. From this unique functional situation, we conclude that the main source of cochlear waveform distortions is a deflection- dependent hair bundle stiffness resulting from constraints imposed by the horizontal top connectors, and not from the intrinsic nonlinear behaviour of the mechanoelectrical transducer channel.","Verpy, Elisabeth; Weil, Dominique; Leibovici, Michel; Goodyear, Richard J.; Hamard, Ghislaine; Houdon, Carine; Lefevre, Gaelle M.; Hardelin, Jean-Pierre; Richardson, Guy P.; Avan, Paul; Petit, Christine","Verpy, E; Weil, D; Leibovici, M; Goodyear, RJ; Hamard, G; Houdon, C; Lefevre, GM; Hardelin, JP; Richardson, GP; Avan, P; Petit, C",255.0,"[Verpy, Elisabeth; Weil, Dominique; Leibovici, Michel; Houdon, Carine; Lefevre, Gaelle M.; Hardelin, Jean-Pierre; Petit, Christine] Inst Pasteur, Unite Genet & Physiol Audit, F-75015 Paris, France; [Verpy, Elisabeth; Weil, Dominique; Leibovici, Michel; Houdon, Carine; Lefevre, Gaelle M.; Hardelin, Jean-Pierre; Petit, Christine] INSERM, UMRS 587, F-75015 Paris, France; [Verpy, Elisabeth; Weil, Dominique; Leibovici, Michel; Houdon, Carine; Lefevre, Gaelle M.; Hardelin, Jean-Pierre; Petit, Christine] Coll France, F-75015 Paris, France; [Verpy, Elisabeth; Weil, Dominique; Leibovici, Michel; Houdon, Carine; Lefevre, Gaelle M.; Hardelin, Jean-Pierre; Petit, Christine] Univ Paris 06, F-75015 Paris, France; [Goodyear, Richard J.; Richardson, Guy P.] Univ Sussex, Sch Life Sci, Brighton BN1 9QG, E Sussex, England; [Hamard, Ghislaine] Inst Cochin Genet Mol, F-75014 Paris, France; [Avan, Paul] Univ Auvergne, Lab Biophys Sensorielle, F-63001 Clermont Ferrand, France",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature07380,Article,,everpy@pasteur.fr; cpetit@pasteur.fr,U56,"European Commission FP6 Integrated Project EuroHear,; Fondation Raymonde et Guy Strittmatter; Region Ile-de-France (Programme Sesame); Wellcome Trust","We thank M.

36,1416,416,"Recent centuries provide no precedent for the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami, either on the coasts it devastated or within its source area. The tsunami claimed nearly all of its victims on shores that had gone 200 years or more without a tsunami disaster(1). The associated earthquake of magnitude 9.2 defied a Sumatra-Andaman catalogue that contains no nineteenth- century or twentieth- century earthquake larger than magnitude 7.9 ( ref. 2). The tsunami and the earthquake together resulted from a fault rupture 1,500 km long that expended centuries' worth of plate convergence(2-5). Here, using sedimentary evidence for tsunamis(6), we identify probable precedents for the 2004 tsunami at a grassy beach- ridge plain 125 km north of Phuket. The 2004 tsunami, running 2 km across this plain, coated the ridges and intervening swales with a sheet of sand commonly 5-20 cm thick. The peaty soils of two marshy swales preserve the remains of several earlier sand sheets less than 2,800 years old. If responsible for the youngest of these pre-2004 sand sheets, the most recent full- size predecessor to the 2004 tsunami occurred about 550 - 700 years ago.","Jankaew, Kruawun; Atwater, Brian F.; Sawai, Yuki; Choowong, Montri; Charoentitirat, Thasinee; Martin, Maria E.; Prendergast, Amy","Jankaew, K; Atwater, BF; Sawai, Y; Choowong, M; Charoentitirat, T; Martin, ME; Prendergast, A",1228.0,"[Jankaew, Kruawun; Choowong, Montri; Charoentitirat, Thasinee] Chulalongkorn Univ, Fac Sci, Dept Geol, Bangkok 10330, Thailand; [Atwater, Brian F.] Univ Washington, US Geol Survey, Dept Earth & Space Sci, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Sawai, Yuki] Natl Inst Adv Ind Sci & Technol, Geol Survey Japan, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058567, Japan; [Martin, Maria E.] Univ Washington, Dept Earth & Space Sci, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Prendergast, Amy] Geosci Australia, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature07373,Article,,kjankaew@yahoo.co.uk,1231,Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment (Thailand); National Science Foundation ( USA); US Agency for International Development; Japan Society for the Promotion of Science; Thailand Research Fund; Chulalongkorn University,"We thank B.

37,1427,427,"Human cancer cells typically harbour multiple chromosomal aberrations, nucleotide substitutions and epigenetic modifications that drive malignant transformation. The Cancer Genome Atlas ( TCGA) pilot project aims to assess the value of large- scale multi- dimensional analysis of these molecular characteristics in human cancer and to provide the data rapidly to the research community. Here we report the interim integrative analysis of DNA copy number, gene expression and DNA methylation aberrations in 206 glioblastomas - the most common type of primary adult brain cancer - and nucleotide sequence aberrations in 91 of the 206 glioblastomas. This analysis provides new insights into the roles of ERBB2, NF1 and TP53, uncovers frequent mutations of the phosphatidylinositol- 3- OH kinase regulatory subunit gene PIK3R1, and provides a network view of the pathways altered in the development of glioblastoma. Furthermore, integration of mutation, DNA methylation and clinical treatment data reveals a link between MGMT promoter methylation and a hypermutator phenotype consequent to mismatch repair deficiency in treated glioblastomas, an observation with potential clinical implications. Together, these findings establish the feasibility and power of TCGA, demonstrating that it can rapidly expand knowledge of the molecular basis of cancer.","Chin, L.; Meyerson, M.; Aldape, K.; Bigner, D.; Mikkelsen, T.; VandenBerg, S.; Kahn, A.; Penny, R.; Ferguson, M.

39,1492,492,"Human mathematical competence emerges from two representational systems. Competence in some domains of mathematics, such as calculus, relies on symbolic representations that are unique to humans who have undergone explicit teaching(1,2). More basic numerical intuitions are supported by an evolutionarily ancient approximate number system that is shared by adults(3-6), infants(7) and non- human animals(8-13) - these groups can all represent the approximate number of items in visual or auditory arrays without verbally counting, and use this capacity to guide everyday behaviour such as foraging. Despite the widespread nature of the approximate number system both across species and across development, it is not known whether some individuals have a more precise non- verbal 'number sense' than others. Furthermore, the extent to which this system interfaces with the formal, symbolic maths abilities that humans acquire by explicit instruction remains unknown. Here we show that there are large individual differences in the non- verbal approximation abilities of 14- year- old children, and that these individual differences in the present correlate with children's past scores on standardized maths achievement tests, extending all the way back to kindergarten. Moreover, this correlation remains significant when controlling for individual differences in other cognitive and performance factors. Our results show that individual differences in achievement in school mathematics are related to individual differences in the acuity of an evolutionarily ancient, unlearned approximate number sense. Further research will determine whether early differences in number sense acuity affect later maths learning, whether maths education enhances number sense acuity, and the extent to which tertiary factors can affect both.","Halberda, Justin; Mazzocco, Michele M.

42,1666,166,"Chromosome translocations are frequently associated with many types of blood-related cancers and childhood sarcomas. Detection of chromosome translocations assists in diagnosis, treatment and prognosis of these diseases(1); however, despite their importance to such diseases, the molecular mechanisms leading to chromosome translocations are not well understood. The available evidence indicates a role for non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) in their origin(1-3). Here we develop a yeast-based system that induces a reciprocal chromosome translocation by formation and ligation of breaks on two different chromosomes. We show that interchromosomal end joining is efficiently suppressed by the Tel1- and Mre11-Rad50-Xrs2-dependent pathway; this is distinct from the role of Tel1 in telomeric integrity and from Mec1- and Tel1- dependent checkpoint controls. Suppression of DSB-induced chromosome translocations depends on the kinase activity of Tel1 and Dun1, and the damage-induced phosphorylation of Sae2 and histone H2AX proteins. Tel1- and Sae2-dependent tethering and promotion of 59 to 39 degradation of broken chromosome ends discourage error-prone NHEJ and interchromosomal NHEJ, preserving chromosome integrity on DNA damage. Our results indicate that, like human ATM, Tel1 serves as a key regulator for chromosome integrity in the pathway that reduces the risk for DSB-induced chromosome translocations, and are probably pertinent to the oncogenic chromosome translocations in ATM-deficient cells.","Lee, Kihoon; Zhang, Yu; Lee, Sang Eun","Lee, K; Zhang, Y; Lee, SE",543.0,"[Lee, Kihoon; Zhang, Yu; Lee, Sang Eun] Univ Texas Hlth Sci Ctr San Antonio, Dept Mol Med, San Antonio, TX 78245 USA; [Lee, Kihoon; Zhang, Yu; Lee, Sang Eun] Univ Texas Hlth Sci Ctr San Antonio, Inst Biotechnol, San Antonio, TX 78245 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature07054,Article,,lees4@uthscsa.edu,U12,,,329IC,,,DOUBLE-STRAND BREAK; DNA-DAMAGE CHECKPOINT; TELOMERE LENGTH; MRE11 COMPLEX; GENOMIC INSTABILITY; BUDDING YEAST; S-PHASE; CHROMATIN; RECOMBINATION; REPAIR,7203.0,NATURE,Nature,English,30.0,No,,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",24-Jul,5.0,LONDON,18650924.0,J,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2008.0,,"Lee, SE (reprint author), Univ Texas Hlth Sci Ctr San Antonio, Dept Mol Med, San Antonio, TX 78245 USA.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,0028-0836,NATURE,43.0,Saccharomyces cerevisiae ATM orthologue suppresses break-induced chromosome translocations,0.0,5.0,WOS:000257860300057,166.0,454,Multidisciplinary Sciences,43,sang eun,lee,4085.0,1,female,1.0,eqT39CEAAAAJ,2,"(1474, 4126]",18455397,1
47,2050,50,"The assimilation and mineralization of dissolved organic carbon ( DOC) by marine bacterioplankton is a major process in the ocean carbon cycle(1). However, little information exists on the specific metabolic functions of participating bacteria and on whether individual taxa specialize on particular components of the marine DOC pool(2). Here we use experimental metagenomics to show that coastal communities are populated by taxa capable of metabolizing a wide variety of organic carbon compounds. Genomic DNA captured from bacterial community subsets metabolizing a single model component of the DOC pool ( either dimethylsulphoniopropionate or vanillate) showed substantial overlap in gene composition as well as a diversity of carbon- processing capabilities beyond the selected phenotypes. Our direct measure of niche breadth for bacterial functional assemblages indicates that, in accordance with ecological theory, heterogeneity in the composition and supply of organic carbon to coastal oceans may favour generalist bacteria. In the important interplay between microbial community structure and biogeochemical cycling, coastal heterotrophic communities may be controlled less by transient changes in the carbon reservoir that they process and more by factors such as trophic interactions and physical conditions.","Mou, Xiaozhen; Sun, Shulei; Edwards, Robert A.; Hodson, Robert E.; Moran, Mary Ann","Mou, XZ; Sun, SL; Edwards, RA; Hodson, RE; Moran, MA",708.0,"[Mou, Xiaozhen; Sun, Shulei; Hodson, Robert E.; Moran, Mary Ann] Univ Georgia, Dept Marine Sci, Athens, GA 30602 USA; [Edwards, Robert A.] San Diego State Univ, Dept Comp Sci, San Diego, CA 92182 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature06513,Article,,mmoran@uga.edu,U4,,,259HD,,,MICROBIAL COMMUNITIES; MARINE-ENVIRONMENT; GRAZING MORTALITY; SURFACE WATERS; GENES; BACTERIOPLANKTON; ASSEMBLAGES; SEQUENCE; GENOMES; IDENTIFICATION,7179.0,NATURE,Nature,English,37.0,No,"Moran, Mary Ann/0000-0002-0702-8167","MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",7-Feb,6.0,LONDON,18223640.0,J,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2008.0,"Moran, Mary Ann/B-6939-2012","Moran, MA (reprint author), Univ Georgia, Dept Marine Sci, Athens, GA 30602 USA.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,0028-0836,NATURE,163.0,Bacterial carbon processing by generalist species in the coastal ocean,4.0,84.0,WOS:000252929500039,50.0,451,Multidisciplinary Sciences,173,mary ann,moran,14964.0,102,female,1.0,O8RSuzkAAAAJ,4,"(9345, 17929]",52190382,1
48,2063,63,"Temporal variations of the frictional resistance on subduction-zone plate boundary faults associated with the stick - slip cycle of large interplate earthquakes are thought to modulate the stress regime and earthquake activity within the subducting oceanic plate(1-3). Here we report on two great earthquakes that occurred near the Kuril islands, which shed light on this process and demonstrate the enhanced seismic hazard accompanying triggered faulting. On 15 November 2006, an event of moment magnitude 8.3 ruptured the shallow- dipping plate boundary along which the Pacific plate descends beneath the central Kuril arc. The thrust ruptured a seismic gap that previously had uncertain seismogenic potential(4,5), although the earlier occurrence of outer- rise compressional events had suggested the presence of frictional resistance(1,2). Within minutes of this large underthrusting event, intraplate extensional earthquakes commenced in the outer rise region seaward of the Kuril trench, and on 13 January 2007, an event of moment magnitude 8.1 ruptured a normal fault extending through the upper portion of the Pacific plate, producing one of the largest recorded shallow extensional earthquakes. This energetic earthquake sequence demonstrates the stress transfer process within the subducting lithosphere, and the distinct rupture characteristics of these great earthquakes illuminate differences in seismogenic properties and seismic hazard of such interplate and intraplate faults.","Ammon, Charles J.; Kanamori, Hiroo; Lay, Thorne","Ammon, CJ; Kanamori, H; Lay, T",561.0,"[Lay, Thorne] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA; [Ammon, Charles J.] Penn State Univ, Dept Geosci, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Kanamori, Hiroo] CALTECH, Seismol Lab, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature06521,Article,,thorne@pmc.ucsc.edu,U4,,,256OQ,,,COUPLED SUBDUCTION ZONES; OUTER RISE EARTHQUAKES; SOLOMON-ISLANDS; MANTLE; TRENCH; PLATE; MODEL,7178.0,NATURE,Nature,English,30.0,No,,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",31-Jan,6.0,LONDON,18235499.0,J,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2008.0,,"Lay, T (reprint author), Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,0028-0836,NATURE,93.0,A great earthquake doublet and seismic stress transfer cycle in the central Kuril islands,2.0,18.0,WOS:000252739900039,63.0,451,Multidisciplinary Sciences,94,thorne,lay,17344.0,1,female,1.0,Ch8Cef0AAAAJ,4,"(9345, 17929]",238517,1
49,2077,77,"The water and dissolved inorganic carbon exported by rivers are important net fluxes that connect terrestrial and oceanic water and carbon reservoirs(1). For most rivers, the majority of dissolved inorganic carbon is in the form of bicarbonate. The riverine bicarbonate flux originates mainly from the dissolution of rock minerals by soil water carbon dioxide, a process called chemical weathering, which controls the buffering capacity and mineral content of receiving streams and rivers(2). Here we introduce an unprecedented high- temporal- resolution, 100- year data set from the Mississippi River and couple it with sub- watershed and precipitation data to reveal that the large increase in bicarbonate flux that has occurred over the past 50 years ( ref. 3) is clearly anthropogenically driven. We show that the increase in bicarbonate and water fluxes is caused mainly by an increase in discharge from agricultural watersheds that has not been balanced by a rise in precipitation, which is also relevant to nutrient and pesticide fluxes to the Gulf of Mexico. These findings demonstrate that alterations in chemical weathering are relevant to improving contemporary biogeochemical budgets. Furthermore, land use change and management were arguably more important than changes in climate and plant CO2 fertilization to increases in riverine water and carbon export from this large region over the past 50 years.","Raymond, Peter A.; Oh, Neung-Hwan; Turner, R.

52,2203,203,"Mice use pheromones, compounds emitted and detected by members of the same species, as cues to regulate social behaviours such as pup suckling, aggression and mating(1). Neurons that detect pheromones are thought to reside in at least two separate organs within the nasal cavity: the vomeronasal organ (VNO) and the main olfactory epithelium (MOE)(2). Each pheromone ligand is thought to activate a dedicated subset of these sensory neurons. However, the nature of the pheromone cues and the identity of the responding neurons that regulate specific social behaviours are largely unknown. Here we show, by direct activation of sensory neurons and analysis of behaviour, that at least two chemically distinct ligands are sufficient to promote male-male aggression and stimulate VNO neurons. We have purified and analysed one of these classes of ligand and found its specific aggression-promoting activity to be dependent on the presence of the protein component of the major urinary protein (MUP) complex, which is known to comprise specialized lipocalin proteins bound to small organic molecules(1,3,4). Using calcium imaging of dissociated vomeronasal neurons (VNs), we have determined that the MUP protein activates a sensory neuron subfamily characterized by the expression of the G-protein G alpha(o) subunit ( also known as Gnao) and Vmn2r putative pheromone receptors (V2Rs).

54,2327,327,"Eubacterial leucyl/phenylalanyl-tRNA protein transferase (LF-transferase) catalyses peptide-bond formation by using Leu-tRNA(Leu) (or Phe-tRNA(Phe)) and an amino-terminal Arg (or Lys) of a protein, as donor and acceptor substrates, respectively. However, the catalytic mechanism of peptide-bond formation by LF-transferase remained obscure. Here we determine the structures of complexes of LF-transferase and phenylalanyl adenosine, with and without a short peptide bearing an N-terminal Arg. Combining the two separate structures into one structure as well as mutation studies reveal the mechanism for peptide-bond formation by LF-transferase. The electron relay from Asp 186 to Gln 188 helps Gln 188 to attract a proton from the alpha-amino group of the N-terminal Arg of the acceptor peptide. This generates the attacking nucleophile for the carbonyl carbon of the aminoacyl bond of the aminoacyl-tRNA, thus facilitating peptide-bond formation. The protein-based mechanism for peptide-bond formation by LF-transferase is similar to the reverse reaction of the acylation step observed in the peptide hydrolysis reaction by serine proteases.","Watanabe, Kazunori; Toh, Yukimatsu; Suto, Kyoko; Shimizu, Yoshihiro; Oka, Natsuhisa; Wada, Takeshi; Tomita, Kozo","Watanabe, K; Toh, Y; Suto, K; Shimizu, Y; Oka, N; Wada, T; Tomita, K",867.0,"Natl Inst Adv Ind Sci & Technol, Inst Biol Resources & Funct, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058566, Japan; Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Frontier Sci, Dept Med Genome Sci, Kashiwa, Chiba 2778562, Japan",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature06167,Article,,kozo-tomita@aist.go.jp,U5,,,221LY,,,N-END RULE; SUBSTRATE RECOGNITION; CRYSTAL-STRUCTURES; PATHWAY; SYSTEM; FAMILY; NUCLEOTIDES; MECHANISM; INSIGHTS; SUBUNIT,7164.0,NATURE,Nature,English,35.0,No,,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",18-Oct,6.0,LONDON,17891155.0,J,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2007.0,"Toh, Yukimatsu/B-6549-2013; Tomita, Kozo/J-5746-2013; Shimizu, Yoshihiro/A-6472-2016","Tomita, K (reprint author), Natl Inst Adv Ind Sci & Technol, Inst Biol Resources & Funct, 1-1-1 Higashi, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058566, Japan.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,0028-0836,NATURE,55.0,Protein-based peptide-bond formation by aminoacyl-tRNA protein transferase,0.0,14.0,WOS:000250230600038,327.0,449,Multidisciplinary Sciences,56,kozo,tomita,1358.0,1,female,1.0,rwcd1tIAAAAJ,1,"[0, 1474]",29462377,1
55,2443,443,"There are five known taste modalities in humans: sweet, bitter, sour, salty and umami (the taste of monosodium glutamate). Although the fruitfly Drosophila melanogaster tastes sugars, salts and noxious chemicals, the nature and number of taste modalities in this organism is not clear. Previous studies have identified one taste cell population marked by the gustatory receptor gene Gr5a that detects sugars, and a second population marked by Gr66a that detects bitter compounds(1-4). Here we identify a novel taste modality in this insect: the taste of carbonated water. We use a combination of anatomical, calcium imaging and behavioural approaches to identify a population of taste neurons that detects CO2 and mediates taste acceptance behaviour. The taste of carbonation may allow Drosophila to detect and obtain nutrients from growing microorganisms. Whereas CO2 detection by the olfactory system mediates avoidance(5), CO2 detection by the gustatory system mediates acceptance behaviour, demonstrating that the context of CO2 determines appropriate behaviour. This work opens up the possibility that the taste of carbonation may also exist in other organisms.","Fischler, Walter; Kong, Priscilla; Marella, Sunanda; Scott, Kristin","Fischler, W; Kong, P; Marella, S; Scott, K",1054.0,"Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mol & Cell Biol, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; Univ Calif Berkeley, Helen Wills Neurosci Inst, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature06101,Article,,kscott@berkeley.edu,U9,NIDCD NIH HHS [R01 DC006252],,205EU,,,CANDIDATE TASTE RECEPTORS; RESPONSES; NEURONS; MELANOGASTER; BEHAVIOR; OXYGEN; BRAIN,7157.0,NATURE,Nature,English,22.0,No,,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",30-Aug,5.0,LONDON,17728758.0,J,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2007.0,,"Scott, K (reprint author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mol & Cell Biol, 291 Life Sci Addit, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,0028-0836,NATURE,74.0,The detection of carbonation by the Drosophila gustatory system,2.0,25.0,WOS:000249097600039,443.0,448,Multidisciplinary Sciences,78,kristin,scott,273.0,1047,female,1.0,_DB9RB4AAAAJ,1,"[0, 1474]",1115791,1

Here we use a metagenomic approach to describe four co-occurring symbionts from the marine oligochaete Olavius algarvensis, a worm lacking a mouth, gut and nephridia. Shotgun sequencing and metabolic pathway reconstruction revealed that the symbionts are sulphur-oxidizing and sulphate-reducing bacteria, all of which are capable of carbon fixation, thus providing the host with multiple sources of nutrition. Molecular evidence for the uptake and recycling of wormwaste products by the symbionts suggests how the worm could eliminate its excretory system, an adaptation unique among annelid worms. We propose a model that describes how the versatile metabolism within this symbiotic consortium provides the host with an optimal energy supply as it shuttles between the upper oxic and lower anoxic coastal sediments that it inhabits.","Woyke, Tanja; Teeling, Hanno; Ivanova, Natalia N.; Huntemann, Marcel; Richter, Michael; Gloeckner, Frank Oliver; Boffelli, Dario; Anderson, Iain J.; Barry, Kerrie W.; Shapiro, Harris J.; Szeto, Ernest; Kyrpides, Nikos C.; Mussmann, Marc; Amann, Rudolf; Bergin, Claudia; Ruehland, Caroline; Rubin, Edward M.; Dubilier, Nicole","Woyke, T; Teeling, H; Ivanova, NN; Huntemann, M; Richter, M; Gloeckner, FO; Boffelli, D; Anderson, IJ; Barry, KW; Shapiro, HJ; Szeto, E; Kyrpides, NC; Mussmann, M; Amann, R; Bergin, C; Ruehland, C; Rubin, EM; Dubilier, N",950.0,"Max Planck Inst Marine Microbiol, D-28359 Bremen, Germany; DOE Joint Genome Inst, Walnut Creek, CA 94598 USA; Univ Calif Berkeley, Lawrence Berkeley Lab, Genom Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; Int Jacobs Univ Bremen, D-28759 Bremen, Germany",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature05192,Article,1476-4687,EMRubin@lbl.gov; ndubilie@mpi-bremen.de,955,,,098LZ,,,BACTERIA; GENOME; GENE; OLIGOCHAETA; COMMUNITIES; SYSTEM; WORM; SEA,7114.0,NATURE,Nature,English,39.0,No,"Amann, Rudolf/0000-0002-0846-7372; Mussmann, Marc/0000-0003-3102-8703; Kyrpides, Nikos/0000-0002-6131-0462; Ivanova, Natalia/0000-0002-5802-9485; Dubilier, Nicole/0000-0002-9394-825X; Barry, Kerrie/0000-0002-8999-6785","MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",26-Oct,6.0,LONDON,16980956.0,J,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2006.0,"Amann, Rudolf/C-6534-2014; Mussmann, Marc/A-8649-2017; Kyrpides, Nikos/A-6305-2014","Rubin, EM (reprint author), Max Planck Inst Marine Microbiol, D-28359 Bremen, Germany.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,0028-0836,NATURE,247.0,Symbiosis insights through metagenomic analysis of a microbial consortium,13.0,94.0,WOS:000241523400045,87.0,443,Multidisciplinary Sciences,258,nicole,dubilier,4442.0,4042,female,1.0,vAXs9hwAAAAJ,3,"(4126, 9345]",35531280,1
59,2611,111,"Mud volcanism is an important natural source of the greenhouse gas methane to the hydrosphere and atmosphere(1,2). Recent investigations show that the number of active submarine mud volcanoes might be much higher than anticipated ( for example, see refs 3 - 5), and that gas emitted from deep-sea seeps might reach the upper mixed ocean(6-8). Unfortunately, global methane emission from active submarine mud volcanoes cannot be quantified because their number and gas release are unknown(9). It is also unclear how efficiently methane-oxidizing microorganisms remove methane. Here we investigate the methane-emitting Haakon Mosby Mud Volcano (HMMV, Barents Sea, 72 degrees N, 14 degrees 44' E; 1,250 m water depth) to provide quantitative estimates of the in situ composition, distribution and activity of methanotrophs in relation to gas emission. The HMMV hosts three key communities: aerobic methanotrophic bacteria (Methylococcales), anaerobic methanotrophic archaea (ANME-2) thriving below siboglinid tubeworms, and a previously undescribed clade of archaea (ANME-3) associated with bacterial mats. We found that the upward flow of sulphate- and oxygen-free mud volcano fluids restricts the availability of these electron acceptors for methane oxidation, and hence the habitat range of methanotrophs. This mechanism limits the capacity of the microbial methane filter at active marine mud volcanoes to <40% of the total flux.","Niemann, Helge; Losekann, Tina; de Beer, Dirk; Elvert, Marcus; Nadalig, Thierry; Knittel, Katrin; Amann, Rudolf; Sauter, Eberhard J.; Schlueter, Michael; Klages, Michael; Foucher, Jean Paul; Boetius, Antje","Niemann, H; Losekann, T; de Beer, D; Elvert, M; Nadalig, T; Knittel, K; Amann, R; Sauter, EJ; Schluter, M; Klages, M; Foucher, JP; Boetius, A",854.0,"Max Planck Inst Marine Microbiol, D-28359 Bremen, Germany; Alfred Wegener Inst Polar & Marine Res, D-27515 Bremerhaven, Germany; IFREMER, Ctr Brest, F-29280 Plouzane, France; Int Jacobs Univ Bremen, D-28759 Bremen, Germany",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature05227,Article,1476-4687,aboetius@mpi-bremen.de,858,,,096FJ,,,SULFATE-REDUCING BACTERIA; ANAEROBIC OXIDATION; CASCADIA MARGIN; HYDRATE RIDGE; WATER COLUMN; SEA; SEDIMENTS; DIVERSITY; ARCHAEA; FLUXES,7113.0,NATURE,Nature,English,30.0,No,"Amann, Rudolf/0000-0002-0846-7372; Niemann, Helge/0000-0002-3468-8304; Boetius, Antje/0000-0003-2117-4176; Sauter, Eberhard/0000-0001-7954-952X; Schlueter, Michael/0000-0002-4997-3802; de Beer, Dirk/0000-0001-5274-1781","MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",19-Oct,5.0,LONDON,17051217.0,J,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2006.0,"Amann, Rudolf/C-6534-2014; Losekann, Tina/J-6358-2014; Niemann, Helge/C-6630-2014; Boetius, Antje/D-5459-2013","Boetius, A (reprint author), Max Planck Inst Marine Microbiol, D-28359 Bremen, Germany.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,0028-0836,NATURE,270.0,Novel microbial communities of the Haakon Mosby mud volcano and their role as a methane sink,3.0,115.0,WOS:000241362700051,111.0,443,Multidisciplinary Sciences,290,antje,boetius,15782.0,34,female,1.0,WBS50wsAAAAJ,4,"(9345, 17929]",579750,1

61,2695,195,"Alternative splicing is a key factor contributing to genetic diversity and evolution(1). Intron retention, one form of alternative splicing, is common in plants(2) but rare in higher eukaryotes(3-8), because messenger RNAs with retained introns are subject to cellular restriction at the level of cytoplasmic export and expression(9,10). Often, retention of internal introns restricts the export of these mRNAs and makes them the targets for degradation by the cellular nonsense-mediated decay machinery if they contain premature stop codons(11,12). In fact, many of the database entries for complementary DNAs with retained introns represent them as artefacts that would not affect the proteome(11). Retroviruses are important model systems in studies of regulation of RNAs with retained introns, because their genomic and mRNAs contain one or more unspliced introns(10). For example, Mason - Pfizer monkey virus overcomes cellular restrictions by using a cis-acting RNA element known as the constitutive transport element (CTE)(13). The CTE interacts directly with the Tap protein ( also known as nuclear RNA export factor 1, encoded by NXF1), which is thought to be a principal export receptor for cellular mRNA(14), leading to the hypothesis that cellular mRNAs with retained introns use cellular CTE equivalents to overcome restrictions to their expression(10). Here we show that the Tap gene contains a functional CTE in its alternatively spliced intron 10. Tap mRNA containing this intron is exported to the cytoplasm and is present in polyribosomes. A small Tap protein is encoded by this mRNA and can be detected in human and monkey cells. Our results indicate that Tap regulates expression of its own intron-containing RNA through a CTE-mediated mechanism. Thus, CTEs are likely to be important elements that facilitate efficient expression of mammalian mRNAs with retained introns.","Li, Ying; Bor, Yeou-cherng; Misawa, Yukiko; Xue, Yuming; Rekosh, David; Hammarskjold, Marie-Louise","Li, Y; Bor, YC; Misawa, Y; Xue, YM; Rekosh, D; Hammarskjold, ML",234.0,"Univ Virginia, Myles H thaler Ctr AIDS & Human Retrovirus Res, Charlottesville, VA 22908 USA; Univ Virginia, Dept Microbiol, Charlottesville, VA 22908 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature05107,Article,,mh7g@virginia.edu,237,,,083OB,,,RETENTION EVENTS; MAMMALIAN-CELLS; NUCLEAR EXPORT; EXPRESSION; PROTEIN; CTE; TRANSLATION; PREDICTION; ISOFORM,7108.0,NATURE,Nature,English,30.0,No,,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",14-Sep,4.0,LONDON,16971948.0,J,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2006.0,,"Hammarskjold, ML (reprint author), Univ Virginia, Myles H thaler Ctr AIDS & Human Retrovirus Res, Charlottesville, VA 22908 USA.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,0028-0836,NATURE,65.0,An intron with a constitutive transport element is retained in a Tap messenger RNA,0.0,5.0,WOS:000240467000052,195.0,443,Multidisciplinary Sciences,67,marie-louise,hammarskjold,6065.0,62,female,1.0,rDWnXl0AAAAJ,3,"(4126, 9345]",335260,1
62,2704,204,"Explosive volcanic eruptions are driven by exsolution of H2O-rich vapour from silicic magma(1). Eruption dynamics involve a complex interplay between nucleation and growth of vapour bubbles and crystallization, generating highly nonlinear variation in the physical properties of magma as it ascends beneath a volcano(2). This makes explosive volcanism difficult to model and, ultimately, to predict. A key unknown is the temperature variation in magma rising through the sub-volcanic system, as it loses gas and crystallizes en route(3). Thermodynamic modelling of magma that degasses, but does not crystallize, indicates that both cooling and heating are possible(4). Hitherto it has not been possible to evaluate such alternatives because of the difficulty of tracking temperature variations in moving magma several kilometres below the surface. Here we extend recent work on glassy melt inclusions trapped in plagioclase crystals(5) to develop a method for tracking pressure-temperature-crystallinity paths in magma beneath two active andesite volcanoes. We use dissolved H2O in melt inclusions to constrain the pressure of H2O at the time an inclusion became sealed, incompatible trace element concentrations to calculate the corresponding magma crystallinity and plagioclase-melt geothermometry to determine the temperature. These data are allied to ilmenite-magnetite geothermometry to show that the temperature of ascending magma increases by up to 100 degrees C, owing to the release of latent heat of crystallization. This heating can account for several common textural features of andesitic magmas, which might otherwise be erroneously attributed to pre-eruptive magma mixing.","Blundy, Jon; Cashman, Kathy; Humphreys, Madeleine","Blundy, J; Cashman, K; Humphreys, M",76.0,"Univ Bristol, Dept Earth Sci, Bristol BS8 1RJ, Avon, England; Univ Oregon, Dept Geol Sci, Eugene, OR 97403 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature05100,Article,1476-4687,Jon.Blundy@bris.ac.uk,80,,,081JM,,,MOUNT ST-HELENS; FE-TI OXIDES; EXPERIMENTAL CONSTRAINTS; PHASE-RELATIONS; SOLUTION MODEL; HILLS VOLCANO; ASCENT RATES; ERUPTION; DACITE; MELT,7107.0,NATURE,Nature,English,32.0,No,"Humphreys, Madeleine/0000-0001-9343-1237","MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",7-Sep,5.0,LONDON,16957729.0,J,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2006.0,"Humphreys, Madeleine/C-3999-2015","Blundy, J (reprint author), Univ Bristol, Dept Earth Sci, Wills Mem Bldg, Bristol BS8 1RJ, Avon, England.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,0028-0836,NATURE,153.0,Magma heating by decompression-driven crystallization beneath andesite volcanoes,2.0,48.0,WOS:000240313900042,204.0,443,Multidisciplinary Sciences,157,madeleine,humphreys,1359.0,248,female,0.99,dmQ8YgwAAAAJ,1,"[0, 1474]",1095706,1
63,2709,209,"The ability of organs such as the liver or the lymphoid system to maintain their original size or regain it after injury is well documented(1,2). However, little is known about how these organs sense that equilibrium is breached, and how they cease changing when homeostasis is reached. Similarly, it remains unclear how, during normal development, different cell types within an organ coordinate their growth. Here we show that during gonad development in the fruitfly Drosophila melanogaster the proliferation of primordial germ cells (PGCs) and survival of the somatic intermingled cells (ICs) that contact them are coordinated by means of a feedback mechanism composed of a positive signal and a negative signal. PGCs express the EGF receptor (EGFR) ligand Spitz, which is required for IC survival. In turn, ICs inhibit PGC proliferation. Thus, homeostasis and coordination of growth between soma and germ line in the larval ovary is achieved by using a sensor of PGC numbers (EGFR-mediated survival of ICs) coupled to a correction mechanism inhibiting PGC proliferation. This feedback loop ensures that sufficient numbers of PGCs exist to fill all the stem-cell niches that form at the end of larval development. We propose that similar feedback mechanisms might be generally used for coordinated growth, regeneration and homeostasis.","Gilboa, Lilach; Lehmann, Ruth","Gilboa, L; Lehmann, R",97.0,"NYU, Sch Med, Howard Hughes Med Inst, New York, NY 10016 USA; NYU, Sch Med, Skirball Inst, Dev Genet Program, New York, NY 10016 USA; NYU, Sch Med, Dept Cell Biol, New York, NY 10016 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature05068,Article,,lehmann@saturn.med.nyu.edu,100,,,081JM,,,STEM-CELLS; SUPPORT CELLS; OVARY; DIFFERENTIATION; MORPHOGENESIS; OOGENESIS; SURVIVAL; LINEAGE; NUMBER,7107.0,NATURE,Nature,English,24.0,No,"Lehmann, Ruth/0000-0002-8454-5651","MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",7-Sep,4.0,LONDON,16936717.0,J,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2006.0,,"Lehmann, R (reprint author), NYU, Sch Med, Howard Hughes Med Inst, 540 1st Ave, New York, NY 10016 USA.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,0028-0836,NATURE,65.0,Soma-germline interactions coordinate homeostasis and growth in the Drosophila gonad,1.0,13.0,WOS:000240313900047,209.0,443,Multidisciplinary Sciences,68,ruth,lehmann,16876.0,1344,female,1.0,k_lj_F0AAAAJ,4,"(9345, 17929]",50105198,1

65,2795,295,"The carbon balance in terrestrial ecosystems is determined by the difference between inputs from primary production and the return of carbon to the atmosphere through decomposition of organic matter(1). Our understanding of the factors that control carbon turnover in water-limited ecosystems is limited, however, as studies of litter decomposition have shown contradictory results and only a modest correlation with precipitation(2-5). Here we evaluate the influence of solar radiation, soil biotic activity and soil resource availability on litter decomposition in the semi-arid Patagonian steppe using the results of manipulative experiments carried out under ambient conditions of rainfall and temperature. We show that intercepted solar radiation was the only factor that had a significant effect on the decomposition of organic matter, with attenuation of ultraviolet-B and total radiation causing a 33 and 60 per cent reduction in decomposition, respectively. We conclude that photodegradation is a dominant control on above-ground litter decomposition in this semi-arid ecosystem. Losses through photochemical mineralization may represent a short-circuit in the carbon cycle, with a substantial fraction of carbon fixed in plant biomass being lost directly to the atmosphere without cycling through soil organic matter pools. Furthermore, future changes in radiation interception due to decreased cloudiness, increased stratospheric ozone depletion, or reduced vegetative cover may have a more significant effect on the carbon balance in these water-limited ecosystems than changes in temperature or precipitation.","Austin, Amy T.; Vivanco, Lucia","Austin, AT; Vivanco, L",555.0,"Univ Buenos Aires, Inst Invest Fisiol & Ecol Vinculadas Agr, RA-1417 Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; Univ Buenos Aires, Fac Agron, CONICET, RA-1417 Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature05038,Article,,austin@ifeva.edu.ar,558,,,069NQ,,,ULTRAVIOLET-B RADIATION; CHIHUAHUAN DESERT; PATAGONIAN STEPPE; RAINFALL GRADIENT; INORGANIC CARBON; ORGANIC-MATTER; DYNAMICS; CO2; ENVIRONMENTS; GRASSLANDS,7102.0,NATURE,Nature,English,30.0,No,"Austin, Amy/0000-0002-7468-5861","MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",3-Aug,4.0,LONDON,16885982.0,J,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2006.0,"Austin, Amy/E-7988-2011","Austin, AT (reprint author), Univ Buenos Aires, Inst Invest Fisiol & Ecol Vinculadas Agr, Av San Martin 4453, RA-1417 Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,0028-0836,NATURE,315.0,Plant litter decomposition in a semi-arid ecosystem controlled by photodegradation,13.0,194.0,WOS:000239455900041,295.0,442,Multidisciplinary Sciences,355,lucia,vivanco,975.0,902,female,0.99,AqKmZ3QAAAAJ,1,"[0, 1474]",3947992,1
67,2939,439,"The organization of the nucleus into subcompartments creates microenvironments that are thought to facilitate distinct nuclear functions(1). In budding yeast, regions of silent chromatin, such as those at telomeres and mating-type loci, cluster at the nuclear envelope creating zones that favour gene repression(1,2). Other reports indicate that gene transcription occurs at the nuclear periphery, apparently owing to association of the gene with nuclear pore complexes(3-5). Here we report that transcriptional activation of a subtelomeric gene, HXK1 ( hexokinase isoenzyme 1), by growth on a non-glucose carbon source led to its relocalization to nuclear pores. This relocation required the 30 untranslated region ( UTR), which is essential for efficient messenger RNA processing and export, consistent with an accompanying report(6). However, activation of HXK1 by an alternative pathway based on the transactivator VP16 moved the locus away from the nuclear periphery and abrogated the normal induction of HXK1 by galactose. Notably, when we interfered with HXK1 localization by either antagonizing or promoting association with the pore, transcript levels were reduced or enhanced, respectively. From this we conclude that nuclear position has an active role in determining optimal gene expression levels.","Taddei, Angela; Van Houwe, Griet; Hediger, Florence; Kalck, Veronique; Cubizolles, Fabien; Schober, Heiko; Gasser, Susan M.","Taddei, A; Van Houwe, G; Hediger, F; Kalck, V; Cubizolles, F; Schober, H; Gasser, SM",774.0,"Friedrich Miescher Inst Biomed Res, CH-4058 Basel, Switzerland; Inst Curie, CNRS, Sect Rech, UMR 218, F-75231 Paris 05, France; Univ Geneva, NCCR Frontiers Genet, CH-1211 Geneva 4, Switzerland",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature04845,Article,,susan.gasser@fmi.ch,778,,,050NL,,,SACCHAROMYCES-CEREVISIAE; TRANSCRIPTIONAL ACTIVATOR; CHROMOSOME DYNAMICS; LOCALIZATION; TELOMERES; PROTEINS; ORGANIZATION; RECRUITMENT; REPRESSION; MACHINERY,7094.0,NATURE,Nature,English,27.0,No,"Cubizolles, Fabien/0000-0002-9822-4074","MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",8-Jun,5.0,LONDON,16760983.0,J,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2006.0,,"Gasser, SM (reprint author), Friedrich Miescher Inst Biomed Res, Maulbeerstr 66, CH-4058 Basel, Switzerland.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,0028-0836,NATURE,251.0,Nuclear pore association confers optimal expression levels for an inducible yeast gene,1.0,12.0,WOS:000238095100060,439.0,441,Multidisciplinary Sciences,256,susan m.,gasser,25268.0,1,female,1.0,gNuBp_AAAAAJ,5,"(17929, ]",33161449,1
68,2964,464,"Chondrules are millimetre-sized spherules (mostly silicate) that dominate the texture of primitive meteorites(1). Their formation mechanism is debated, but their sheer abundance suggests that the mechanism was both energetic and ubiquitous in the early inner Solar System(2). The processes suggested-such as shock waves, solar flares or nebula lightning(3-7)-operate on different length scales that have been hard to relate directly to chondrule properties. Chondrules are depleted in volatile elements, but surprisingly they show little evidence for the associated loss of lighter isotopes one would expect(8). Here we report a model in which molten chondrules come to equilibrium with the gas that was evaporated from other chondrules, and which explains the observations in a natural way. The regions within which the chondrules formed must have been larger than 150-6,000 km in radius, and must have had a precursor number density of at least 10 m(-3). These constraints probably exclude nebula lightning, and also make formation far from the nebula midplane problematic. The wide range of chondrule compositions may be the result of different combinations of the local concentrations of precursors and the local abundance of water ice or vapour.","Cuzzi, JN; Alexander, CMO","Cuzzi, JN; Alexander, CMO",483.0,"NASA, Ames Res Ctr, Div Space Sci, Moffett Field, CA 94035 USA; Carnegie Inst Washington, Dept Terr Magnetism, Washington, DC 20015 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature04834,Article,,jcuzzi@mail.arc.nasa.gov,485,,,045YP,,,SOLAR NEBULA; ISOTOPIC FRACTIONATION; PROTOPLANETARY DISK; EVOLUTION; MODEL; CONSTRAINTS; ORIGIN; SHOCKS,7092.0,NATURE,Nature,English,27.0,No,"Alexander, Conel/0000-0002-8558-1427","MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",25-May,3.0,LONDON,16724060.0,J,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2006.0,"Alexander, Conel/N-7533-2013","Cuzzi, JN (reprint author), NASA, Ames Res Ctr, Div Space Sci, Moffett Field, CA 94035 USA.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,0028-0836,NATURE,79.0,Chondrule formation in particle-rich nebular regions at least hundreds of kilometres across,1.0,5.0,WOS:000237778900043,464.0,441,Multidisciplinary Sciences,79,cmo,alexander,89141.0,1,female,1.0,Tb0ZrYwAAAAJ,5,"(17929, ]",205920,1
71,3177,177,"The anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM) with sulfate controls the emission of the greenhouse gas methane from the ocean floor(1,2). In marine sediments, AOM is performed by dual-species consortia of anaerobic methanotrophic archaea (ANME) and sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) inhabiting the methane-sulfate transition zone(3-5). The biochemical pathways and biological adaptations enabling this globally relevant process are not fully understood. Here we study the syntrophic interaction in thermophilic AOM (TAOM) between ANME-1 archaea and their consortium partner SRB HotSeep-1 (ref. 6) at 60 degrees C to test the hypothesis of a direct interspecies exchange of electrons(7,8.) The activity of TAOM consortia was compared to the first ANME-free culture of an AOM partner bacterium that grows using hydrogen as the sole electron donor. The thermophilic ANME-1 do not produce sufficient hydrogen to sustain the observed growth of the HotSeep-1 partner. Enhancing the growth of the HotSeep-1 partner by hydrogen addition represses methane oxidation and the metabolic activity of ANME-1. Further supporting the hypothesis of direct electron transfer between the partners, we observe that under TAOM conditions, both ANME and the HotSeep-1 bacteria overexpress genes for extracellular cytochrome production and form cell-to-cell connections that resemble the nanowire structures responsible for interspecies electron transfer between syntrophic consortia of Geobacter(9,10). HotSeep-1 highly expresses genes for pili production only during consortial growth using methane, and the nanowire-like structures are absent in HotSeep-1 cells isolated with hydrogen. These observations suggest that direct electron transfer is a principal mechanism in TAOM, which may also explain the enigmatic functioning and specificity of other methanotrophic ANME-SRB consortia.","Wegener, Gunter; Krukenberg, Viola; Riedel, Dietmar; Tegetmeyer, Halina E.; Boetius, Antje","Wegener, G; Krukenberg, V; Riedel, D; Tegetmeyer, HE; Boetius, A",587.0,"[Wegener, Gunter; Krukenberg, Viola; Boetius, Antje] Max Planck Inst Marine Mikrobiol, D-28359 Bremen, Germany; [Wegener, Gunter; Boetius, Antje] Univ Bremen, Ctr Marine Environm Sci, MARUM, D-28359 Bremen, Germany; [Riedel, Dietmar] Max Planck Inst Biophys Chem, D-37077 Gottingen, Germany; [Tegetmeyer, Halina E.; Boetius, Antje] Alfred Wegener Inst Helmholtz Ctr Polar & Marine, D-27570 Bremerhaven, Germany; [Tegetmeyer, Halina E.] Univ Bielefeld, Ctr Biotechnol, D-33615 Bielefeld, Germany",,,11/19/17,,10.1038/nature15733,Article,1476-4687,gwegener@mpi-bremen.de; vkrukenb@mpi-bremen.de,U315,"DFG Leibniz program; DFG excellence cluster MARUM, Center of Marine Environmental Sciences, Bremen; Max Planck Society","We thank K.

72,3205,205,"The high prevalence of sickle haemoglobin in Africa shows that malaria has been a major force for human evolutionary selection, but surprisingly few other polymorphisms have been proven to confer resistance to malaria in large epidemiological studies(1-3). To address this problem, we conducted a multi-centre genome-wide association study (GWAS) of life-threatening Plasmodium falciparum infection (severe malaria) in over 11,000 African children, with replication data in a further 14,000 individuals. Here we report a novel malaria resistance locus close to a cluster of genes encoding glycophorins that are receptors for erythrocyte invasion by P. falciparum. We identify a haplotype at this locus that provides 33% protection against severe malaria (odds ratio = 0.67, 95% confidence interval = 0.60-0.76, P value = 9.5 x 10(-11)) and is linked to polymorphisms that have previously been shown to have features of ancient balancing selection, on the basis of haplotype sharing between humans and chimpanzees(4). Taken together with previous observations on the malaria-protective role of blood group O-1-3,O-5, these data reveal that two of the strongest GWAS signals for severe malaria lie in or close to genes encoding the glycosylated surface coat of the erythrocyte cell membrane, both within regions of the genome where it appears that evolution has maintained diversity for millions of years. These findings provide new insights into the host-parasite interactions that are critical in determining the outcome of malaria infection.","Band, Gavin; Rockett, Kirk A.; Spencer, Chris C.

73,3224,224,"Despite major advances in understanding the molecular and genetic basis of cancer, metastasis remains the cause of >90% of cancer-related mortality(1). Understanding metastasis initiation and progression is critical to developing new therapeutic strategies to treat and prevent metastatic disease. Prevailing theories hypothesize that metastases are seeded by rare tumour cells with unique properties, which may function like stem cells in their ability to initiate and propagate metastatic tumours(2-5). However, the identity of metastasis-initiating cells in human breast cancer remains elusive, and whether metastases are hierarchically organized is unknown(2). Here we show at the single-cell level that early stage metastatic cells possess a distinct stem-like gene expression signature. To identify and isolate metastatic cells from patient-derived xenograft models of human breast cancer, we developed a highly sensitive fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS)-based assay, which allowed us to enumerate metastatic cells in mouse peripheral tissues. We compared gene signatures in metastatic cells from tissues with low versus high metastatic burden. Metastatic cells from low-burden tissues were distinct owing to their increased expression of stem cell, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, pro-survival, and dormancy-associated genes. By contrast, metastatic cells from high-burden tissues were similar to primary tumour cells, which were more heterogeneous and expressed higher levels of luminal differentiation genes. Transplantation of stem-like metastatic cells from low-burden tissues showed that they have considerable tumour-initiating capacity, and can differentiate to produce luminal-like cancer cells. Progression to high metastatic burden was associated with increased proliferation and MYC expression, which could be attenuated by treatment with cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitors. These findings support a hierarchical model for metastasis, in which metastases are initiated by stem-like cells that proliferate and differentiate to produce advanced metastatic disease.","Lawson, Devon A.; Bhakta, Nirav R.; Kessenbrock, Kai; Prummel, Karin D.; Yu, Ying; Takai, Ken; Zhou, Alicia; Eyob, Henok; Balakrishnan, Sanjeev; Wang, Chih-Yang; Yaswen, Paul; Goga, Andrei; Werb, Zena","Lawson, DA; Bhakta, NR; Kessenbrock, K; Prummel, KD; Yu, Y; Takai, K; Zhou, A; Eyob, H; Balakrishnan, S; Wang, CY; Yaswen, P; Goga, A; Werb, Z",131.0,"[Lawson, Devon A.; Kessenbrock, Kai; Prummel, Karin D.; Yu, Ying; Takai, Ken; Wang, Chih-Yang; Werb, Zena] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Anat, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; [Bhakta, Nirav R.; Goga, Andrei] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Med, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; [Kessenbrock, Kai; Zhou, Alicia; Eyob, Henok; Balakrishnan, Sanjeev; Goga, Andrei] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Cell & Tissue Biol, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; [Wang, Chih-Yang] Natl Cheng Kung Univ, Coll Med, Inst Basic Med Sci, Tainan 70101, Taiwan; [Yaswen, Paul] Univ Calif Berkeley, Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Dept Cell & Mol Biol, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",,,11/19/17,,10.1038/nature15260,Article,1476-4687,andrei.goga@ucsf.edu; zena.werb@ucsf.edu,+,"National Cancer Institute [CA180039, CA136717]; Stand Up To Cancer/AACR [DT0409]; Era of Hope Scholar Award [W81XWH-12-1-0272]; Breast Cancer Research Foundation; Atwater Foundation; US Department of Defense Congressionally Directed Medical Research Program postdoctoral fellowship [11-1-0742]; Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan [104-2917-I-006-002]","We thank A.

74,3295,295,"Most exoplanetary systems in binary stars are of S-type, and consist of one or more planets orbiting a primary star with a wide binary stellar companion(1,2). Planetary eccentricities and mutual inclinations can be large(3,4), perhaps forced gravitationally by the binary companion(4-6). Earlier work on single planet systems(5,7-10) appealed to the Kozai-Lidov instability(11,12) wherein a sufficiently inclined binary orbit excites large-amplitude oscillations in the planet's eccentricity and inclination. The instability, however, can be quenched by many agents that induce fast orbital precession, including mutual gravitational forces in a multiplanet system(5,13). Here we report that orbital precession, which inhibits Kozai-Lidov cycling in a multiplanet system, can become fast enough to resonate with the orbital motion of a distant binary companion. Resonant binary forcing results in dramatic outcomes ranging from the excitation of large planetary eccentricities and mutual inclinations to total disruption. Processes such as planetary migration(14,15) can bring an initially non-resonant system into resonance. As it does not require special physical or initial conditions, binary resonant driving is generic and may have altered the architecture of many multiplanet systems. It can also weaken the multiplanet occurrence rate in wide binaries, and affect planet formation in close binaries.","Touma, Jihad R.; Sridhar, S.","Touma, JR; Sridhar, S",439.0,"[Touma, Jihad R.] Amer Univ Beirut, Dept Phys, Beirut 11072020, Lebanon; [Sridhar, S.] Raman Res Inst, Bangalore 560080, Karnataka, India",,,11/19/17,,10.1038/nature14873,Article,1476-4687,jihad.touma@aub.edu.lb,441,,,CP7LN,,,STELLAR MULTIPLICITY; PLANETARY SYSTEM; PERTURBATIONS; MIGRATION; EVOLUTION; ORIGIN; ECCENTRICITY; COMPANIONS; BODIES; STARS,7566.0,NATURE,Nature,English,29.0,No,,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",27-Aug,3.0,LONDON,26310763.0,J,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2015.0,"Sridhar, S/D-4895-2012","Touma, JR (reprint author), Amer Univ Beirut, Dept Phys, POB 11-0236, Beirut 11072020, Lebanon.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,0028-0836,NATURE,5.0,The disruption of multiplanet systems through resonance with a binary orbit,1.0,9.0,WOS:000360069300031,295.0,524,Multidisciplinary Sciences,5,s.,sridhar,9065.0,1,female,1.0,kDuCdb4AAAAJ,3,"(4126, 9345]",50489393,1
75,3328,328,"The specifics of how galaxies form from, and are fuelled by, gas from the intergalactic medium remain uncertain. Hydrodynamic simulations suggest that 'cold accretion flows'-relatively cool (temperatures of the order of 104 kelvin), unshocked gas streaming along filaments of the cosmic web into dark-matter halos(1-3)-are important. These flows are thought to deposit gas and angular momentum into the circumgalactic medium, creating disk-or ring-like structures that eventually coalesce into galaxies that form at filamentary intersections(4,5). Recently, a large and luminous filament, consistent with such a cold accretion flow, was discovered near the quasi-stellar object QSO UM287 at redshift 2.279 using narrow-band imaging(6). Unfortunately, imaging is not sufficient to constrain the physical characteristics of the filament, to determine its kinematics, to explain how it is linked to nearby sources, or to account for its unusual brightness, more than a factor of ten above what is expected for a filament. Here we report a two-dimensional spectroscopic investigation of the emitting structure. We find that the brightest emission region is an extended rotating hydrogen disk with a velocity profile that is characteristic of gas in a darkmatter halo with a mass of 10(13) solar masses. This giant protogalactic disk appears to be connected to a quiescent filament that may extend beyond the virial radius of the halo. The geometry is strongly suggestive of a cold accretion flow.","Martin, D. Christopher; Matuszewski, Mateusz; Morrissey, Patrick; Neill, James D.; Moore, Anna; Cantalupo, Sebastiano; Prochaska, J.

How the same machinery can either completely degrade or precisely trim RNA substrates has long remained unexplained. Here we report the crystal structures of a yeast nuclear exosome containing the 9-subunit core, the 3'-5' RNases Rrp44 and Rrp6, and the obligate Rrp6-binding partner Rrp47 in complex with different RNAs. The combined structural and biochemical data of this 12-subunit complex reveal how a single-stranded RNA can reach the Rrp44 or Rrp6 active sites directly or can bind Rrp6 and be threaded via the central channel towards the distal RNase Rrp44. When a bulky RNA is stalled at the entrance of the channel, Rrp6-Rrp47 swings open. The results suggest how the same molecular machine can coordinate processive degradation and partial trimming in an RNA-dependent manner by a concerted swinging mechanism of the two RNase subunits.","Makino, Debora Lika; Schuch, Benjamin; Stegmann, Elisabeth; Baumgaertner, Marc; Basquin, Claire; Conti, Elena","Makino, DL; Schuch, B; Stegmann, E; Baumgartner, M; Basquin, C; Conti, E",54.0,"[Makino, Debora Lika; Schuch, Benjamin; Stegmann, Elisabeth; Baumgaertner, Marc; Basquin, Claire; Conti, Elena] Max Planck Inst Biochem, Dept Struct Cell Biol, D-82152 Martinsried, Germany",,,11/19/17,,10.1038/nature14865,Article,1476-4687,conti@biochem.mpg.de,U89,"Max Planck Gesellschaft; European Commission (ERC Advanced Investigator Grant) [294371]; European Commission (Marie Curie ITN RNPnet); Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft [DFG SFB646, SFB1035, GRK1721, FOR1680]; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (CIPSM); Louis Jeantet Foundation","We would like to thank the MPIB Crystallization Facility and MPIB Core Facility; the beamline scientists at SLS beamlines PXII and PXIII and APS beamline 17-ID-B for assistance with data collection; M.

77,3365,365,"Dielectric materials, which store energy electrostatically, are ubiquitous in advanced electronics and electric power systems(1-8). Compared to their ceramic counterparts, polymer dielectrics have higher breakdown strengths and greater reliability(1-3,9), are scalable, lightweight and can be shaped into intricate configurations, and are therefore an ideal choice for many power electronics, power conditioning, and pulsed power applications(1,9,10). However, polymer dielectrics are limited to relatively low working temperatures, and thus fail to meet the rising demand for electricity under the extreme conditions present in applications such as hybrid and electric vehicles, aerospace power electronics, and underground oil and gas exploration(11-13). Here we describe crosslinked polymer nanocomposites that contain boron nitride nanosheets, the dielectric properties of which are stable over a broad temperature and frequency range. The nanocomposites have outstanding high-voltage capacitive energy storage capabilities at record temperatures (a Weibull breakdown strength of 403 megavolts per metre and a discharged energy density of 1.8 joules per cubic centimetre at 250 degrees Celsius). Their electrical conduction is several orders of magnitude lower than that of existing polymers and their high operating temperatures are attributed to greatly improved thermal conductivity, owing to the presence of the boron nitride nanosheets, which improve heat dissipation compared to pristine polymers (which are inherently susceptible to thermal runaway). Moreover, the polymer nanocomposites are lightweight, photopatternable and mechanically flexible, and have been demonstrated to preserve excellent dielectric and capacitive performance after intensive bending cycles. These findings enable broader applications of organic materials in high-temperature electronics and energy storage devices.","Li, Qi; Chen, Lei; Gadinski, Matthew R.; Zhang, Shihai; Zhang, Guangzu; Li, Haoyu; Haque, Aman; Chen, Long-Qing; Jackson, Thomas N.; Wang, Qing","Li, Q; Chen, L; Gadinski, MR; Zhang, SH; Zhang, GZ; Li, HY; Haque, A; Chen, LQ; Jackson, TN; Wang, Q",576.0,"[Li, Qi; Chen, Lei; Gadinski, Matthew R.; Zhang, Guangzu; Chen, Long-Qing; Wang, Qing] Penn State Univ, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Zhang, Shihai] PolyK Technol, State Coll, PA 16802 USA; [Li, Haoyu; Jackson, Thomas N.] Penn State Univ, Dept Elect Engn, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Haque, Aman] Penn State Univ, Dept Mech & Nucl Engn, University Pk, PA 16802 USA",,,11/19/17,,10.1038/nature14647,Article,1476-4687,wang@matse.psu.edu,+,US Office of Naval Research [N00014-11-1-0342]; Air Force Office of Scientific Research [FA9550-14-1-0264]; Dow Chemical Corporation,Q.W. acknowledges financial support from the US Office of Naval Research under grant number N00014-11-1-0342.

78,3455,455,"The ability of an atom or molecular fragment to bind multiple carbon monoxide (CO) molecules to form multicarbonyl adducts is a fundamental trait of transition metals. Transition-metal carbonyl complexes are vital to industry, appear naturally in the active sites of a number of enzymes (such as hydrogenases), are promising therapeutic agents(1), and have even been observed in interstellar dust clouds(2). Despite the wealth of established transition-metal multicarbonyl complexes(3), no elements outside groups 4 to 12 of the periodic table have yet been shown to react directly with two or more CO units to form stable multicarbonyl adducts. Here we present the synthesis of a borylene dicarbonyl complex, the first multicarbonyl complex of a main-group element prepared using CO. The compound is additionally stable towards ambient air and moisture. The synthetic strategy used-liberation of a borylene ligand from a transition metal using donor ligands-is broadly applicable, leading to a number of unprecedented monovalent boron species with different Lewis basic groups. The similarity of these compounds to conventional transition-metal carbonyl complexes is demonstrated by photolytic liberation of CO and subsequent intramolecular carbon-carbon bond activation.","Braunschweig, Holger; Dewhurst, Rian D.; Hupp, Florian; Nutz, Marco; Radacki, Krzysztof; Tate, Christopher W.; Vargas, Alfredo; Ye, Qing","Braunschweig, H; Dewhurst, RD; Hupp, F; Nutz, M; Radacki, K; Tate, CW; Vargas, A; Ye, Q",327.0,"[Braunschweig, Holger; Dewhurst, Rian D.; Hupp, Florian; Nutz, Marco; Radacki, Krzysztof; Tate, Christopher W.; Ye, Qing] Univ Wurzburg, Inst Anorgan Chem, D-97074 Wurzburg, Germany; [Vargas, Alfredo] Univ Sussex, Sch Life Sci, Dept Chem, Brighton BN1 9QJ, E Sussex, England",,,11/19/17,,10.1038/nature14489,Article,1476-4687,h.braunschweig@uni-wuerzburg.de,330,European Research Council,This work was supported by a European Research Council Advanced Grant to H.B.,CK7PU,Y,N,BORON TRIPLE BOND; DATIVE BONDS; SOLID-STATE; ACTIVATION; REACTIVITY; COMPOUND; CARBENES; CARBONYL; ARROWS; ADDUCT,7556.0,NATURE,Nature,English,30.0,No,"Vargas, Alfredo/0000-0001-7491-791X; Braunschweig, Holger/0000-0001-9264-1726; Dewhurst, Rian/0000-0001-5978-811X","MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",18-Jun,4.0,LONDON,26085273.0,J,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2015.0,"Ye, Qing/J-2736-2014; Vargas, Alfredo/N-6711-2015","Braunschweig, H (reprint author), Univ Wurzburg, Inst Anorgan Chem, D-97074 Wurzburg, Germany.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,0028-0836,NATURE,70.0,Multiple complexation of CO and related ligands to a main-group element,9.0,76.0,WOS:000356425400050,455.0,522,Multidisciplinary Sciences,70,qing,ye,4503.0,27,female,1.0,kyw15pIAAAAJ,3,"(4126, 9345]",51548610,1
79,3463,463,"About half of human genes use alternative cleavage and polyadenylation (ApA) to generate messenger RNA transcripts that differ in the length of their 3' untranslated regions (3' UTRs) while producing the same protein(1-3). Here we show in human cell lines that alternative 3' UTRs differentially regulate the localization of membrane proteins. The long 3' UTR of CD47 enables efficient cell surface expression of CD47 protein, whereas the short 3' UTR primarily localizes CD47 protein to the endoplasmic reticulum. CD47 protein localization occurs post-translationally and independently of RNA localization. In our model of 3' UTR-dependent protein localization, the long 3' UTR of CD47 acts as a scaffold to recruit a protein complex containing the RNA-binding protein HuR (also known as ELAVL1) and SET4 to the site of translation. This facilitates interaction of SET with the newly translated cytoplasmic domains of CD47 and results in subsequent translocation of CD47 to the plasma membrane via activated RAC1 (ref. 5). We also show that CD47 protein has different functions depending on whether it was generated by the short or long 3' UTR isoforms. Thus, ApA contributes to the functional diversity of the proteome without changing the amino acid sequence. 3' UTR-dependent protein localization has the potential to be a widespread trafficking mechanism for membrane proteins because HuR binds to thousands of mRNAs(6-9), and we show that the long 3' UTRs of CD44, ITGA1 and TNFRSF13C, which are bound by HuR, increase surface protein expression compared to their corresponding short 3' UTRs. We propose that during translation the scaffold function of 3' UTRs facilitates binding of proteins to nascent proteins to direct their transport or function-and this role of 3' UTRs can be regulated by ApA.","Berkovits, Binyamin D.; Mayr, Christine","Berkovits, BD; Mayr, C",363.0,"[Berkovits, Binyamin D.; Mayr, Christine] Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Canc Biol & Genet Program, New York, NY 10065 USA",,,11/19/17,,10.1038/nature14321,Article,1476-4687,mayrc@mskcc.org,+,Damon Runyon-Rachleff Cancer Foundation; Island Outreach Foundation [DRR-24-13]; National Institutes of Health [U01-CA164190];  [P30 CA008748],"This work was funded by the Innovator Award of the Damon Runyon-Rachleff Cancer Foundation and the Island Outreach Foundation (DRR-24-13) and National Institutes of Health grant U01-CA164190.

80,3476,476,"Endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) are remnants of ancient retroviral infections, and comprise nearly 8% of the human genome(1). The most recently acquired human ERV is HERVK(HML-2), which repeatedly infected the primate lineage both before and after the divergence of the human and chimpanzee common ancestor(2,3). Unlike most other human ERVs, HERVK retained multiple copies of intact open reading frames encoding retroviral proteins(4). However, HERVK is transcriptionally silenced by the host, with the exception of in certain pathological contexts such as germ-cell tumours, melanoma or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection(5-7). Here we demonstrate that DNA hypomethylation at long terminal repeat elements representing the most recent genomic integrations, together with transactivation by OCT4 (also known as POU5F1), synergistically facilitate HERVK expression. Consequently, HERVK is transcribed during normal human embryogenesis, beginning with embryonic genome activation at the eight-cell stage, continuing through the emergence of epiblast cells in preimplantation blastocysts, and ceasing during human embryonic stem cell derivation from blastocyst outgrowths. Remarkably, we detected HERVK viral-like particles and Gag proteins in human blastocysts, indicating that early human development proceeds in the presence of retroviral products. We further show that overexpression of one such product, the HERVK accessory protein Rec, in a pluripotent cell line is sufficient to increase IFITM1 levels on the cell surface and inhibit viral infection, suggesting at least one mechanism through which HERVK can induce viral restriction pathways in early embryonic cells. Moreover, Rec directly binds a subset of cellular RNAs and modulates their ribosome occupancy, indicating that complex interactions between retroviral proteins and host factors can fine-tune pathways of early human development.","Grow, Edward J.; Flynn, Ryan A.; Chavez, Shawn L.; Bayless, Nicholas L.; Wossidlo, Mark; Wesche, Daniel J.; Martin, Lance; Ware, Carol B.; Blish, Catherine A.; Chang, Howard Y.; Pera, Renee A.

81,3492,492,"Tissue homeostasis is achieved through a balance of cell production (growth) and elimination (regression)(1,2). In contrast to tissue growth, the cells and molecular signals required for tissue regression remain unknown. To investigate physiological tissue regression, we use the mouse hair follicle, which cycles stereotypically between phases of growth and regression while maintaining a pool of stem cells to perpetuate tissue regeneration(3). Here we show by intravital microscopy in live mice(4-6) that the regression phase eliminates the majority of the epithelial cells by two distinct mechanisms: terminal differentiation of suprabasal cells and a spatial gradient of apoptosis of basal cells. Furthermore, we demonstrate that basal epithelial cells collectively act as phagocytes to clear dying epithelial neighbours. Through cellular and genetic ablation we show that epithelial cell death is extrinsically induced through transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta activation and mesenchymal crosstalk. Strikingly, our data show that regression acts to reduce the stem cell pool, as inhibition of regression results in excess basal epithelial cells with regenerative abilities. This study identifies the cellular behaviours and molecular mechanisms of regression that counterbalance growth to maintain tissue homeostasis.","Mesa, Kailin R.; Rompolas, Panteleimon; Zito, Giovanni; Myung, Peggy; Sun, Thomas Y.; Brown, Samara; Gonzalez, David G.; Blagoev, Krastan B.; Haberman, Ann M.; Greco, Valentina","Mesa, KR; Rompolas, P; Zito, G; Myung, P; Sun, TY; Brown, S; Gonzalez, DG; Blagoev, KB; Haberman, AM; Greco, V",94.0,"[Mesa, Kailin R.; Rompolas, Panteleimon; Myung, Peggy; Sun, Thomas Y.; Brown, Samara; Greco, Valentina] Yale Univ, Sch Med, Dept Genet, New Haven, CT 06510 USA; [Zito, Giovanni] Univ Palermo, Dept Biopathol & Med Biotechnol, I-90100 Palermo, Italy; [Myung, Peggy; Greco, Valentina] Yale Univ, Sch Med, Dept Dermatol, New Haven, CT 06510 USA; [Gonzalez, David G.; Haberman, Ann M.] Yale Univ, Sch Med, Dept Immunobiol, Dept Lab Med, New Haven, CT 06510 USA; [Blagoev, Krastan B.] Natl Sci Fdn, Arlington, VA 22230 USA; [Blagoev, Krastan B.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Massachusetts Gen Hosp, AA Martinos Ctr Biomed Imaging,Dept Radiol, Boston, MA 02114 USA; [Greco, Valentina] Yale Univ, Sch Med, Yale Stem Cell Ctr, New Haven, CT 06510 USA; [Greco, Valentina] Yale Univ, Sch Med, Yale Canc Ctr, New Haven, CT 06510 USA",,,11/19/17,,10.1038/nature14306,Article,1476-4687,valentina.greco@yale.edu,U236,"National Institutes of Health (NIH) [5T32 GM007223]; American Cancer Society [RSG-12-059-02]; National Cancer Institute, NIH [2P50CA121974]; National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases (NIAMS), NIH [1R01AR063663-01]; New York Stem Cell Foundation; NIAMS Rheumatic Diseases Research Core Centers [5 P30 AR053495-07]; NSF","We thank E.

82,3550,49,"The connection between an altered gut microbiota and metabolic disorders such as obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease is well established(1,2). Defects in preserving the integrity of the mucosal barriers can result in systemic endotoxaemia that contributes to chronic low-grade inflammation, which further promotes the development ofmetabolic syndrome(3-5). Interleukin (IL)-22 exerts essential roles in eliciting antimicrobial immunity and maintaining mucosal barrier integrity within the intestine(6,7). Here we investigate the connection between IL-22 and metabolic disorders. We find that the induction of IL-22 from innate lymphoid cells and CD4(+) T cells is impaired in obese mice under various immune challenges, especially in the colon during infection with Citrobacter rodentium. While innate lymphoid cell populations are largely intact in obese mice, the upregulation of IL-23, a cytokine upstream of IL-22, is compromised during the infection. Consequently, these mice are susceptible to C. rodentium infection, and both exogenous IL-22 and IL-23 are able to restore the mucosal host defence. Importantly, we further unveil unexpected functions of IL-22 in regulating metabolism. Mice deficient in IL-22 receptor and fed with high-fat diet are prone to developing metabolic disorders. Strikingly, administration of exogenous IL-22 in genetically obese leptin-receptor-deficient (db/db) mice and mice fed with high-fat diet reverses many of the metabolic symptoms, including hyperglycaemia and insulin resistance. IL-22 shows diverse metabolic benefits, as it improves insulin sensitivity, preserves gut mucosal barrier and endocrine functions, decreases endotoxaemia and chronic inflammation, and regulates lipid metabolism in liver and adipose tissues. In summary, we identify the IL-22 pathway as a novel target for therapeutic intervention in metabolic diseases.","Wang, Xiaoting; Ota, Naruhisa; Manzanillo, Paolo; Kates, Lance; Zavala-Solorio, Jose; Eidenschenk, Celine; Zhang, Juan; Lesch, Justin; Lee, Wyne P.; Ross, Jed; Diehl, Lauri; van Bruggen, Nicholas; Kolumam, Ganesh; Ouyang, Wenjun","Wang, XT; Ota, N; Manzanillo, P; Kates, L; Zavala-Solorio, J; Eidenschenk, C; Zhang, J; Lesch, J; Lee, WP; Ross, J; Diehl, L; van Bruggen, N; Kolumam, G; Ouyang, WJ",237.0,"[Wang, Xiaoting; Ota, Naruhisa; Manzanillo, Paolo; Eidenschenk, Celine; Zhang, Juan; Lesch, Justin; Lee, Wyne P.; Ouyang, Wenjun] Genentech Inc, Dept Immunol, San Francisco, CA 94080 USA; [Kates, Lance; Zavala-Solorio, Jose; Ross, Jed; van Bruggen, Nicholas; Kolumam, Ganesh] Genentech Inc, Dept Biomed Imaging, San Francisco, CA 94080 USA; [Diehl, Lauri] Genentech Inc, Dept Pathol, San Francisco, CA 94080 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature13564,Article,1476-4687,kolumam@gene.com; ouyang@gene.com,+,,,AQ3BG,,,INDUCED INSULIN-RESISTANCE; FOOD-INTAKE; CITROBACTER-RODENTIUM; GUT MICROBIOME; PPAR-GAMMA; OBESITY; LEPTIN; CELLS; INFLAMMATION; MICE,7521.0,NATURE,Nature,English,37.0,No,"Ouyang, Wenjun/0000-0002-1811-5864","MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",9-Oct,16.0,LONDON,25119041.0,J,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2014.0,,"Ouyang, WJ (reprint author), Genentech Inc, Dept Immunol, San Francisco, CA 94080 USA.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,0028-0836,NATURE,80.0,Interleukin-22 alleviates metabolic disorders and restores mucosal immunity in diabetes,7.0,64.0,WOS:000342663100044,49.0,514,Multidisciplinary Sciences,82,wenjun,ouyang,15218.0,1,female,1.0,lnpG64sAAAAJ,4,"(9345, 17929]",51548610,1
83,3589,88,"Cichlid fishes are famous for large, diverse and replicated adaptive radiations in the Great Lakes of East Africa. To understand themolecular mechanisms underlying cichlid phenotypic diversity, we sequenced the genomes and transcriptomes of five lineages of African cichlids: the Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus), an ancestral lineage with low diversity; and four members of the East African lineage: Neolamprologus brichardi/pulcher (older radiation, Lake Tanganyika), Metriaclima zebra (recent radiation, Lake Malawi), Pundamilia nyererei (very recent radiation, Lake Victoria), and Astatotilapia burtoni (riverine species around Lake Tanganyika). We found an excess of gene duplications in the East African lineage compared to tilapia and other teleosts, an abundance of non-coding element divergence, accelerated coding sequence evolution, expression divergence associated with transposable element insertions, and regulation by novel microRNAs. In addition, we analysed sequence data from sixty individuals representing six closely related species from Lake Victoria, and show genome-wide diversifying selection on coding and regulatory variants, some of which were recruited from ancient polymorphisms. We conclude that a number of molecular mechanisms shaped East African cichlid genomes, and that amassing of standing variation during periods of relaxed purifying selection may have been important in facilitating subsequent evolutionary diversification.","Brawand, David; Wagner, Catherine E.; Li, Yang I.; Malinsky, Milan; Keller, Irene; Fan, Shaohua; Simakov, Oleg; Ng, Alvin Y.; Lim, Zhi Wei; Bezault, Etienne; Turner-Maier, Jason; Johnson, Jeremy; Alcazar, Rosa; Noh, Hyun Ji; Russell, Pamela; Aken, Bronwen; Alfoeldi, Jessica; Amemiya, Chris; Azzouzi, Naoual; Baroiller, Jean-Francois; Barloy-Hubler, Frederique; Berlin, Aaron; Bloomquist, Ryan; Carleton, Karen L.; Conte, Matthew A.; D'Cotta, Helena; Eshel, Orly; Gaffney, Leslie; Galibert, Francis; Gante, Hugo F.; Gnerre, Sante; Greuter, Lucie; Guyon, Richard; Haddad, Natalie S.; Haerty, Wilfried; Harris, Rayna M.; Hofmann, Hans A.; Hourlier, Thibaut; Hulata, Gideon; Jaffe, David B.; Lara, Marcia; Lee, Alison P.; MacCallum, Iain; Mwaiko, Salome; Nikaido, Masato; Nishihara, Hidenori; Ozouf-Costaz, Catherine; Penman, David J.; Przybylski, Dariusz; Rakotomanga, Michaelle; Renn, Suzy C.

84,3594,93,"It is widely believed that the Sahara desert is no more than similar to 2-3-million years (Myr) old(1), with geological evidence showing a remarkable aridification of north Africa at the onset of the Quaternary ice ages(2-4). Before that time, north African aridity was mainly controlled by the African summer monsoon (ASM)(5-8), which oscillated with Earth's orbital precession cycles. Afterwards, the Northern Hemisphere glaciation added an ice volume forcing on the ASM, which additionally oscillated with glacial-interglacial cycles(2). These findings led to the idea that the Sahara desert came into existence when the Northern Hemisphere glaciated similar to 2-3 Myr ago. The later discovery, however, of aeolian dune deposits similar to 7 Myr old(9) suggested a much older age, although this interpretation is hotly challenged(1) and there is no clear mechanism for aridification around this time. Here we use climate model simulations to identify the Tortonian stage (similar to 7-11 Myr ago) of the Late Miocene epoch as the pivotal period for triggering north African aridity and creating the Sahara desert. Through a set of experiments with the Norwegian Earth System Model(10) and the Community Atmosphere Model(11), we demonstrate that the African summer monsoon was drastically weakened by the Tethys Sea shrinkage during the Tortonian, allowing arid, desert conditions to expand across north Africa. Not only did the Tethys shrinkage alter the mean climate of the region, it also enhanced the sensitivity of the African monsoon to orbital forcing, which subsequently became the major driver of Sahara extent fluctuations. These important climatic changes probably caused the shifts in Asian and African flora and fauna observed during the same period(4,12-14), with possible links to the emergence of early hominins in north Africa(15,16).","Zhang, Zhongshi; Ramstein, Gilles; Schuster, Mathieu; Li, Camille; Contoux, Camille; Yan, Qing","Zhang, ZS; Ramstein, G; Schuster, M; Li, C; Contoux, C; Yan, Q",401.0,"[Zhang, Zhongshi; Contoux, Camille] Uni Res Climate, Bjerknes Ctr Climate Res, N-5007 Bergen, Norway; [Zhang, Zhongshi; Yan, Qing] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Atmospher Phys, Nansen Zhu Int Res Ctr, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China; [Ramstein, Gilles] CE Saclay, CEA CNRS UVSQ, Lab Sci Climat & Environm IPSL, UMR8212, F-91191 Gif Sur Yvette, France; [Schuster, Mathieu] CNRS, Ecole & Observ Sci Terre, Inst Phys Globe Strasbourg UMR 7516, F-67084 Strasbourg, France; [Schuster, Mathieu] Univ Strasbourg, F-67084 Strasbourg, France; [Li, Camille] Univ Bergen, Inst Geophys, Bjerknes Ctr Climate Res, N-5007 Bergen, Norway",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature13705,Article,1476-4687,zhongshi.zhang@uni.no,+,"Chinese Academy of Sciences [XDA05080803]; National 973 Program of China [2010CB950102]; Earth System Modelling (ESM) project - Statoil, Norway; Dynamics of Past Warm Climates (DYNAWARM) project - Centre for Climate Dynamics (SKD) at the Bjerknes Centre; Aurora mobility program France-Norway - Research Council of Norway","We thank N.

85,3619,118,"Photosynthesis, a process catalysed by plants, algae and cyanobacteria converts sunlight to energy thus sustaining all higher life on Earth. Two large membrane protein complexes, photosystem I and II (PSI and PSII), act in series to catalyse the light-driven reactions in photosynthesis. PSII catalyses the light-driven water splitting process, which maintains the Earth's oxygenic atmosphere(1). In this process, the oxygen-evolving complex (OEC) of PSII cycles through five states, S-0 to S-4, in which four electrons are sequentially extracted from the OEC in four light-driven charge-separation events. Here we describe time resolved experiments on PSII nano/microcrystals from Thermosynechococcus elongatus performed with the recently developed(2) technique of serial femtosecond crystallography. Structures have been determined from PSII in the dark S-1 state and after double laser excitation (putative S-3 state) at 5 and 5.5 angstrom resolution, respectively. The results provide evidence that PSII undergoes significant conformational changes at the electron acceptor side and at the Mn4CaO5 core of the OEC. These include an elongation of the metal cluster, accompanied by changes in the protein environment, which could allow for binding of the second substrate water molecule between the more distant protruding Mn (referred to as the 'dangler' Mn) and the Mn3CaOx cubane in the S-2 to S-3 transition, as predicted by spectroscopic and computational studies(3,4). This work shows the great potential for time-resolved serial femtosecond crystallography for investigation of catalytic processes in biomolecules.","Kupitz, Christopher; Basu, Shibom; Grotjohann, Ingo; Fromme, Raimund; Zatsepin, Nadia A.; Rendek, Kimberly N.; Hunter, Mark S.; Shoeman, Robert L.; White, Thomas A.; Wang, Dingjie; James, Daniel; Yang, Jay-How; Cobb, Danielle E.; Reeder, Brenda; Sierra, Raymond G.; Liu, Haiguang; Barty, Anton; Aquila, Andrew L.; Deponte, Daniel; Kirian, Richard A.; Bari, Sadia; Bergkamp, Jesse J.; Beyerlein, Kenneth R.; Bogan, Michael J.; Caleman, Carl; Chao, Tzu-Chiao; Conrad, Chelsie E.; Davis, Katherine M.; Fleckenstein, Holger; Galli, Lorenzo; Hau-Riege, Stefan P.; Kassemeyer, Stephan; Laksmono, Hartawan; Liang, Mengning; Lomb, Lukas; Marchesini, Stefano; Martin, Andrew V.; Messerschmidt, Marc; Milathianaki, Despina; Nass, Karol; Ros, Alexandra; Roy-Chowdhury, Shatabdi; Schmidt, Kevin; Seibert, Marvin; Steinbrener, Jan; Stellato, Francesco; Yan, Lifen; Yoon, Chunhong; Moore, Thomas A.; Moore, Ana L.; Pushkar, Yulia; Williams, Garth J.; Boutet, Sebastien; Doak, R.

88,3896,395,"Reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced by phagocytes are essential for host defence against bacterial and fungal infections. Individuals with defective ROS production machinery develop chronic granulomatous disease(1,2). Conversely, excessive ROS can cause collateral tissue damage during inflammatory processes and therefore needs to be tightly regulated. Here we describe a protein, we termed negative regulator of ROS (NRROS), which limits ROS generation by phagocytes during inflammatory responses. NRROS expression in phagocytes can be repressed by inflammatory signals. NRROS-deficient phagocytes produce increased ROS upon inflammatory challenges, and mice lacking NRROS in their phagocytes show enhanced bactericidal activity against Escherichia coli and Listeria monocytogenes. Conversely, these mice develop severe experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis owing to oxidative tissue damage in the central nervous system. Mechanistically, NRROS is localized to the endoplasmic reticulum, where it directly interactswith nascent NOX2 (also known as gp91(phox) and encoded by Cybb) monomer, one of the membrane-bound subunits of the NADPH oxidase complex, and facilitates the degradation of NOX2 through the endoplasmic-reticulum-associated degradation pathway. Thus, NRROS provides a hitherto undefined mechanism for regulating ROS prodution-one that enables phagocytes to produce higher amounts of ROS, if required to control invading pathogens, while minimizing unwanted collateral tissue damage.","Noubade, Rajkumar; Wong, Kit; Ota, Naruhisa; Rutz, Sascha; Eidenschenk, Celine; Valdez, Patricia A.; Ding, Jiabing; Peng, Ivan; Sebrell, Andrew; Caplazi, Patrick; DeVoss, Jason; Soriano, Robert H.; Sai, Tao; Lu, Rongze; Modrusan, Zora; Hackney, Jason; Ouyang, Wenjun","Noubade, R; Wong, K; Ota, N; Rutz, S; Eidenschenk, C; Valdez, PA; Ding, JB; Peng, I; Sebrell, A; Caplazi, P; DeVoss, J; Soriano, RH; Sai, T; Lu, RZ; Modrusan, Z; Hackney, J; Ouyang, WJ",235.0,"[Noubade, Rajkumar; Wong, Kit; Ota, Naruhisa; Rutz, Sascha; Eidenschenk, Celine; Valdez, Patricia A.; Ding, Jiabing; Peng, Ivan; DeVoss, Jason; Lu, Rongze; Ouyang, Wenjun] Genentech Inc, Dept Immunol, San Francisco, CA 94080 USA; [Sebrell, Andrew; Sai, Tao] Genentech Inc, Dept Antibody Engn, San Francisco, CA 94080 USA; [Caplazi, Patrick] Genentech Inc, Dept Pathol, San Francisco, CA 94080 USA; [Soriano, Robert H.; Modrusan, Zora] Genentech Inc, Dept Mol Biol, San Francisco, CA 94080 USA; [Hackney, Jason] Genentech Inc, Dept Bioinformat, San Francisco, CA 94080 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature13152,Article,1476-4687,ouyang.wenjun@gene.com,+,,,AG5JC,,,CHRONIC GRANULOMATOUS-DISEASE; NEUTROPHIL NADPH OXIDASE; PLASMA-MEMBRANE; LYSOSOMAL MEMBRANE; MACROPHAGES; ENCEPHALOMYELITIS; PHOSPHORYLATION; ACTIVATION; EXPRESSION; APOPTOSIS,7499.0,NATURE,Nature,English,38.0,No,"Ouyang, Wenjun/0000-0002-1811-5864; Caplazi, Patrick/0000-0002-3411-1257; Hackney, Jason/0000-0002-5922-563X","MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",8-May,18.0,LONDON,24739962.0,J,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2014.0,"Lu, Rongze/R-2149-2016","Ouyang, WJ (reprint author), Genentech Inc, Dept Immunol, 1 DNA Way, San Francisco, CA 94080 USA.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,0028-0836,NATURE,52.0,NRROS negatively regulates reactive oxygen species during host defence and autoimmunity,1.0,42.0,WOS:000335454300041,395.0,509,Multidisciplinary Sciences,54,wenjun,ouyang,15218.0,1,female,1.0,lnpG64sAAAAJ,4,"(9345, 17929]",51548610,1
89,3930,429,"Akt, also known as protein kinase B, plays key roles in cell proliferation, survival and metabolism. Akt hyperactivation contributes to many pathophysiological conditions, including human cancers(1-3), and is closely associated with poor prognosis and chemo-or radio-therapeutic resistance(4). Phosphorylation of Akt at S473 (ref. 5) and T308 (ref. 6) activates Akt. However, it remains unclear whether further mechanisms account for full Akt activation, and whether Akt hyperactivation is linked to misregulated cell cycle progression, another cancer hallmark(7). Here we report that Akt activity fluctuates across the cell cycle, mirroring cyclin A expression. Mechanistically, phosphorylation of S477 and T479 at the Akt extreme carboxy terminus by cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (Cdk2)/cyclin A or mTORC2, under distinct physiological conditions, promotes Akt activation through facilitating, or functionally compensating for, S473 phosphorylation. Furthermore, deletion of the cyclin A2 allele in the mouse olfactory bulb leads to reduced S477/T479 phosphorylation and elevated cellular apoptosis. Notably, cyclin A2-deletion-induced cellular apoptosis in mouse embryonic stem cells is partly rescued by S477D/T479E-Akt1, supporting a physiological role for cyclin A2 in governing Akt activation. Together, the results of our study show Akt S477/T479 phosphorylation to be an essential layer of the Akt activation mechanism to regulate its physiological functions, thereby providing a new mechanistic link between aberrant cell cycle progression and Akt hyperactivation in cancer.","Liu, Pengda; Begley, Michael; Michowski, Wojciech; Inuzuka, Hiroyuki; Ginzberg, Miriam; Gao, Daming; Tsou, Peiling; Gan, Wenjian; Papa, Antonella; Kim, Byeong Mo; Wan, Lixin; Singh, Amrik; Zhai, Bo; Yuan, Min; Wang, Zhiwei; Gygi, Steven P.; Lee, Tae Ho; Lu, Kun-Ping; Toker, Alex; Pandolfi, Pier Paolo; Asara, John M.; Kirschner, Marc W.; Sicinski, Piotr; Cantley, Lewis; Wei, Wenyi","Liu, PD; Begley, M; Michowski, W; Inuzuka, H; Ginzberg, M; Gao, DM; Tsou, PL; Gan, WJ; Papa, A; Kim, BM; Wan, LX; Singh, A; Zhai, B; Yuan, M; Wang, ZW; Gygi, SP; Lee, TH; Lu, KP; Toker, A; Pandolfi, PP; Asara, JM; Kirschner, MW; Sicinski, P; Cantley, L; Wei, WY",541.0,"[Liu, Pengda; Inuzuka, Hiroyuki; Gao, Daming; Gan, Wenjian; Papa, Antonella; Wan, Lixin; Wang, Zhiwei; Toker, Alex; Pandolfi, Pier Paolo; Wei, Wenyi] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Pathol, Beth Israel Deaconess Med Ctr, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Begley, Michael; Tsou, Peiling; Papa, Antonella; Yuan, Min; Lu, Kun-Ping; Pandolfi, Pier Paolo; Asara, John M.; Cantley, Lewis] Beth Israel Deaconess Med Ctr, Dept Med, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Begley, Michael; Tsou, Peiling; Kirschner, Marc W.; Cantley, Lewis] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Syst Biol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Michowski, Wojciech; Sicinski, Piotr] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Canc Biol, Dana Farber Canc Inst, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Michowski, Wojciech; Sicinski, Piotr] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Genet, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Ginzberg, Miriam; Zhai, Bo; Gygi, Steven P.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Cell Biol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Papa, Antonella; Pandolfi, Pier Paolo] Beth Israel Deaconess Med Ctr, Canc Genet Program, Dept Med, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Papa, Antonella; Pandolfi, Pier Paolo] Beth Israel Deaconess Med Ctr, Div Genet, Dept Med, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Singh, Amrik] Cell Signaling Technol, Danvers, MA 01923 USA; [Kim, Byeong Mo; Lee, Tae Ho] Beth Israel Deaconess Med Ctr, Div Gerontol, Dept Med, Boston, MA 02215 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature13079,Article,1476-4687,wwei2@bidmc.harvard.edu,+,"National Institutes of Health [GM089763, GM094777, CA177910, 2P01CA120964, R01CA132740];  [5T32HL007893]","We thank J.

90,3967,466,"The concepts and ideas of coherent, nonlinear and quantum optics have been extended to photon energies in the range of 10-100 kilo-electronvolts, corresponding to soft gamma-ray radiation (the term used when the radiation is produced in nuclear transitions) or, equivalently, hard X-ray radiation (the term used when the radiation is produced by electron motion). The recent experimental achievements in this energy range include the demonstration of parametric down-conversion in the Langevin regime(1), electromagnetically induced transparency in a cavity(2), the collective Lamb shift(3), vacuum-assisted generation of atomic coherences(4) and single-photon revival in nuclear absorbing multilayer structures(5). Also, realization of single-photon coherent storage(6) and stimulated Raman adiabatic passage(7) were recently proposed in this regime. More related work is discussed in a recent review(8). However, the number of tools for the coherent manipulation of interactions between gamma-ray photons and nuclear ensembles remains limited. Here we suggest and implement an efficient method to control the waveforms of gamma-ray photons coherently. In particular, we demonstrate the conversion of individual recoilless gamma-ray photons into a coherent, ultrashort pulse train and into a double pulse. Our method is based on the resonant interaction of gamma-ray photons with an ensemble of nuclei with a resonant transition frequency that is periodically modulated in time. The frequency modulation, which is achieved by a uniform vibration of the resonant absorber, owing to the Doppler effect, renders resonant absorption and dispersion both time dependent, allowing us to shape the waveforms of the incident gamma-ray photons. We expect that this technique will lead to advances in the emerging fields of coherent and quantum gamma-ray photon optics, providing a basis for the realization of gamma-ray-photon/nuclear-ensemble interfaces and quantum interference effects at nuclear gamma-ray transitions.","Vagizov, Farit; Antonov, Vladimir; Radeonychev, Y.

92,4072,71,"Schizophrenia is a common disease with a complex aetiology, probably involving multiple and heterogeneous genetic factors. Here, by analysing the exome sequences of 2,536 schizophrenia cases and 2,543 controls, we demonstrate a polygenic burden primarily arising from rare (less than 1 in 10,000), disruptive mutations distributed across many genes. Particularly enriched gene sets include the voltage-gated calcium ion channel and the signalling complex formed by the activity-regulated cytoskeleton-associated scaffold protein (ARC) of the postsynaptic density, sets previously implicated by genome-wide association and copy-number variation studies. Similar to reports in autism, targets of the fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP, product of FMR1) are enriched for case mutations. No individual gene-based test achieves significance after correction for multiple testing and we do not detect any alleles of moderately low frequency (approximately 0.5 to 1 per cent) and moderately large effect. Taken together, these data suggest that population-based exome sequencing can discover risk alleles and complements established gene-mapping paradigms in neuropsychiatric disease.","Purcell, Shaun M.; Moran, Jennifer L.; Fromer, Menachem; Ruderfer, Douglas; Solovieff, Nadia; Roussos, Panos; O'Dushlaine, Colm; Chambert, Kimberly; Bergen, Sarah E.; Kahler, Anna; Duncan, Laramie; Stahl, Eli; Genovese, Giulio; Fernandez, Esperanza; Collins, Mark O.; Komiyama, Noboru H.; Choudhary, Jyoti S.; Magnusson, Patrik K.

93,4138,137,"Stellar-mass black holes have all been discovered through X-ray emission, which arises from the accretion of gas from their binary companions (this gas is either stripped from low-mass stars or supplied as winds from massive ones). Binary evolution models also predict the existence of black holes accreting from the equatorial envelope of rapidly spinning Be-type stars(1-3) (stars of the Be type are hot blue irregular variables showing characteristic spectral emission lines of hydrogen). Of the approximately 80 Be X-ray binaries known in the Galaxy, however, only pulsating neutron stars have been found as companions(2-4). A black hole was formally allowed as a solution for the companion to the Be star MWC656 (ref. 5; also known as HD 215227), although that conclusion was based on a single radial velocity curve of the Be star, a mistaken spectral classification(6) and rough estimates of the inclination angle. Here we report observations of an accretion disk line mirroring the orbit of MWC656. This, together with an improved radial velocity curve of the Be star through fitting sharp Fe II profiles from the equatorial disk, and a refined Be classification (to that of a B1.5-B2 III star), indicates that a black hole of 3.8 to 6.9 solar masses orbits MWC656, the candidate counterpart of the gamma-ray source AGL J2241+4454 (refs 5, 6). The black hole is X-ray quiescent and fed by a radiatively inefficient accretion flow giving a luminosity less than 1.6x10(-7) times the Eddington luminosity. This implies that Be binaries with black-hole companions are difficult to detect in conventional X-ray surveys.","Casares, J.; Negueruela, I.; Ribo, M.; Ribas, I.; Paredes, J.

94,4161,160,"The evolutionary survival of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the cause of human tuberculosis, depends on its ability to invade the host, replicate, and transmit infection. At its initial peripheral infection site in the distal lung airways, M. tuberculosis infects macrophages, which transport it to deeper tissues(1). How mycobacteria survive in these broadly microbicidal cells is an important question. Here we show in mice and zebrafish that M. tuberculosis, and its close pathogenic relative Mycobacterium marinum, preferentially recruit and infect permissive macrophages while evading microbicidal ones. This immune evasion is accomplished by using cell-surface-associated phthiocerol dimycoceroserate (PDIM) lipids(2) to mask underlying pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). In the absence of PDIM, these PAMPs signal a Toll-like receptor (TLR)-dependent recruitment of macrophages that produce microbicidal reactive nitrogen species. Concordantly, the related phenolic glycolipids (PGLs)(2) promote the recruitment of permissive macrophages through a host chemokine receptor 2 (CCR2)-mediated pathway. Thus, we have identified coordinated roles for PDIM, known to be essential for mycobacterial virulence(3), and PGL, which (along with CCR2) is known to be associated with human tuberculosis(4,5). Our findings also suggest an explanation for the longstanding observation that M. tuberculosis initiates infection in the relatively sterile environment of the lower respiratory tract, rather than in the upper respiratory tract, where resident microflora and inhaled environmental microbes may continually recruit microbicidal macrophages through TLR-dependent signalling.","Cambier, C.

96,4318,317,"Stem-cell niches in mammalian tissues are often heterogeneous and compartmentalized; however, whether distinct niche locations determine different stem-cell fates remains unclear. To test this hypothesis, here we use the mouse hair follicle niche and combine intravital microscopy with genetic lineage tracing to re-visit the same stem-cell lineages, from their exact place of origin, throughout regeneration in live mice. Using this method, we show directly that the position of a stem cell within the hair follicle niche can predict whether it is likely to remain uncommitted, generate precursors or commit to a differentiated fate. Furthermore, using laser ablation we demonstrate that hair follicle stem cells are dispensable for regeneration, and that epithelial cells, which do not normally participate in hair growth, re-populate the lost stem-cell compartment and sustain hair regeneration. This study provides a general model for niche-induced fate determination in adult tissues.","Rompolas, Panteleimon; Mesa, Kailin R.; Greco, Valentina","Rompolas, P; Mesa, KR; Greco, V",513.0,"[Rompolas, Panteleimon; Mesa, Kailin R.; Greco, Valentina] Yale Univ, Sch Med, Dept Genet, Dept Dermatol,Yale Stem Cell Ctr,Yale Canc Ctr, New Haven, CT 06510 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature12602,Article,1476-4687,valentina.greco@yale.edu,+,New York Stem Cell Foundation; American Cancer Society [RGS-12-059-01-DCC]; National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases [1RO1AR063663-01],"We are grateful to S.

102,4555,54,"Although transitions of sex-determination mechanisms are frequent in species with homomorphic sex chromosomes(1-3), heteromorphic sex chromosomes are thought to represent a terminal evolutionary stage owing to chromosome-specific adaptations such as dosage compensation or an accumulation of sex-specific mutations(1,4). Here we show that an autosome of Drosophila, the dot chromosome, was ancestrally a differentiated X chromosome. We analyse the whole genome of true fruitflies (Tephritidae), flesh flies (Sarcophagidae) and soldier flies (Stratiomyidae) to show that genes located on the dot chromosome of Drosophila are X-linked in outgroup species, whereas Drosophila X-linked genes are autosomal. We date this chromosomal transition to early drosophilid evolution by sequencing the genome of other Drosophilidae. Our results reveal several puzzling aspects of Drosophila dot chromosome biology to be possible remnants of its former life as a sex chromosome, such as its minor feminizing role in sex determination(5) or its targeting by a chromosome-specific regulatory mechanism(6). We also show that patterns of biased gene expression of the dot chromosome during early embryogenesis, oogenesis and spermatogenesis resemble that of the current X chromosome. Thus, although sex chromosomes are not necessarily evolutionary end points and can revert back to an autosomal inheritance, the highly specialized genome architecture of this former X chromosome suggests that severe fitness costs must be overcome for such a turnover to occur.","Vicoso, Beatriz; Bachtrog, Doris","Vicoso, B; Bachtrog, D",332.0,"[Vicoso, Beatriz; Bachtrog, Doris] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Integrat Biol, Ctr Theoret Evolutionary Genom, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature12235,Article,1476-4687,dbachtrog@berkeley.edu,+,"National Institutes of Health [R01GM076007, R01GM093182]; Packard Fellowship","We thank S.

104,4612,111,"Every holographic video display is built on a spatial light modulator, which directs light by diffraction to form points in three-dimensional space. The modulators currently used for holographic video displays are challenging to use for several reasons: they have relatively low bandwidth, high cost, low diffraction angle, poor scalability, and the presence of quantization noise, unwanted diffractive orders and zero-order light. Here we present modulators for holographic video displays based on anisotropic leaky-mode couplers, which have the potential to address all of these challenges. These modulators can be fabricated simply, monolithically and at low cost. Additionally, these modulators are capable of new functionalities, such as wavelength division multiplexing for colour display. We demonstrate three enabling properties of particular interest-polarization rotation, enlarged angular diffraction, and frequency domain colour filtering-and suggest that this technology can be used as a platform for low-cost, high-performance holographic video displays.","Smalley, D.

105,4671,170,"The ability of signalling proteins to traverse tissues containing tightly packed cells is of fundamental importance for cell specification and tissue development; however, how this is achieved at a cellular level remains poorly understood(1). For more than a century, the vertebrate limb bud has served as a model for studying cell signalling during embryonic development(2). Here we optimize single-cell real-time imaging to delineate the cellular mechanisms for how signalling proteins, such as sonic hedgehog (SHH), that possess membrane-bound covalent lipid modifications traverse long distances within the vertebrate limb bud in vivo. By directly imaging SHH ligand production under native regulatory control in chick (Gallus gallus) embryos, our findings show that SHH is unexpectedly produced in the form of a particle that remains associated with the cell via long cytoplasmic extensions that span several cell diameters. We show that these cellular extensions are a specialized class of actin-based filopodia with novel cytoskeletal features that have not been previously described. Notably, particles containing SHH travel along these extensions with a net anterograde movement within the field of SHH cell signalling. We further show that in SHH-responding cells, specific subsets of SHH co-receptors, including cell adhesion molecule downregulated by oncogenes (CDO) and brother of CDO (BOC), actively distribute and co-localize in specific micro-domains within filopodial extensions, far from the cell body. Stabilized interactions are formed between filopodia containing SHH ligand and those containing co-receptors over a long range. These results suggest that contact-mediated release propagated by specialized filopodia contributes to the delivery of SHH at a distance. Together, these studies identify an important mode of communication between cells that considerably extends our understanding of ligand movement and reception during vertebrate tissue patterning.","Sanders, Timothy A.; Llagostera, Esther; Barna, Maria","Sanders, TA; Llagostera, E; Barna, M",628.0,"[Sanders, Timothy A.; Llagostera, Esther; Barna, Maria] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Biochem & Biophys, San Francisco, CA 94158 USA; [Sanders, Timothy A.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Div Neonatol, Dept Pediat, San Francisco, CA 94158 USA; [Llagostera, Esther; Barna, Maria] Stanford Univ, Dept Dev Biol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Llagostera, Esther; Barna, Maria] Stanford Univ, Dept Genet, Stanford, CA 94305 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature12157,Article,,mbarna@stanford.edu,+,"Spanish Ministry of Education and Science; Program for Breakthrough Biomedical Research, UCSF; March of Dimes Basil O'Connor Scholar Research Award; National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Disease, part of NIH [NIH R21AR062262]","We thank D.

The molecular mechanism and function of this assembly have remained elusive due to lack of structural information. Here we have used an in vitro reconstituted system to study the stepwise assembly of human TBP, TFIIA, TFIIB, Pol II, TFIIF, TFIIE and TFIIH onto promoter DNA using cryo-electron microscopy. Our structural analyses provide pseudo-atomic models at various stages of transcription initiation that illuminate critical molecular interactions, including how TFIIF engages Pol II and promoter DNA to stabilize both the closed pre-initiation complex and the open-promoter complex, and to regulate start-site selection. Comparison of open versus closed pre-initiation complexes, combined with the localization of the TFIIH helicases XPD and XPB, support a DNA translocation model of XPB and explain its essential role in promoter opening.","He, Yuan; Fang, Jie; Taatjes, Dylan J.; Nogales, Eva","He, Y; Fang, J; Taatjes, DJ; Nogales, E",481.0,"[He, Yuan; Nogales, Eva] Univ Calif Berkeley, Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Life Sci Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Fang, Jie; Nogales, Eva] Univ Calif Berkeley, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Taatjes, Dylan J.] Univ Colorado, Dept Chem & Biochem, Boulder, CO 80303 USA; [Nogales, Eva] Univ Calif Berkeley, QB3 Inst, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Nogales, Eva] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mol & Cell Biol, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature11991,Article,,ENogales@lbl.gov,+,NIGMS [GM63072]; NCI [CA127364],"We thank C.

The ubiquitous core of the yeast exosome (Exo-10) is formed by nine catalytically inert subunits (Exo-9) and a single active RNase, Rrp44. In the nucleus, the Exo-10 core recruits another nuclease, Rrp6. Here we crystallized an approximately 440-kilodalton complex of Saccharomyces cerevisiae Exo-10 bound to a carboxy-terminal region of Rrp6 and to an RNA duplex with a 3'-overhang of 31 ribonucleotides. The 2.8 angstrom resolution structure shows how RNA is funnelled into the Exo-9 channel in a single-stranded conformation by an unwinding pore. Rrp44 adopts a closed conformation and captures the RNA 3'-end that exits from the side of Exo-9. Exo-9 subunits bind RNA with-sequence-unspecific interactions reminiscent of archaeal exosomes. The substrate binding and channelling mechanisms of 3'-5' RNA degradation complexes are conserved in all kingdoms of life.","Makino, Debora Lika; Baumgaertner, Marc; Conti, Elena","Makino, DL; Baumgartner, M; Conti, E",70.0,"[Makino, Debora Lika; Baumgaertner, Marc; Conti, Elena] MPI Biochem, Dept Struct Cell Biol, D-82152 Martinsried, Germany",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature11870,Article,,conti@biochem.mpg.de,75,"Max Planck Gesellschaft; ERC [294371]; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft [SFB646, SFB1035, GRK1721, CIPSM]; Max Planck Institute Biochemistry Core Facility and Crystallization Facility","We would like to thank the Max Planck Institute Biochemistry Core Facility and Crystallization Facility; the staff members at beamlines X10SA (Swiss Light Source) and ID23-2 (European Synchrotron Radiation Facility)for support; F.

111,4899,398,"The lysosomal degradation pathway of autophagy has a crucial role in defence against infection, neurodegenerative disorders, cancer and ageing. Accordingly, agents that induce autophagy may have broad therapeutic applications. One approach to developing such agents is to exploit autophagy manipulation strategies used by microbial virulence factors. Here we show that a peptide, Tat-beclin 1-derived from a region of the autophagy protein, beclin 1, which binds human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 Nef-is a potent inducer of autophagy, and interacts with a newly identified negative regulator of autophagy, GAPR-1 (also called GLIPR2). Tat-beclin 1 decreases the accumulation of polyglutamine expansion protein aggregates and the replication of several pathogens (including HIV-1) in vitro, and reduces mortality in mice infected with chikungunya or West Nile virus. Thus, through the characterization of a domain of beclin 1 that interacts with HIV-1 Nef, we have developed an autophagy-inducing peptide that has potential efficacy in the treatment of human diseases.","Shoji-Kawata, Sanae; Sumpter, Rhea, Jr.; Leveno, Matthew; Campbell, Grant R.; Zou, Zhongju; Kinch, Lisa; Wilkins, Angela D.; Sun, Qihua; Pallauf, Kathrin; MacDuff, Donna; Huerta, Carlos; Virgin, Herbert W.; Helms, J.

112,4914,413,"Candida albicans, the most prevalent human fungal pathogen, is considered to be an obligate diploid that carries recessive lethal mutations throughout the genome. Here we demonstrate that C. albicans has a viable haploid state that can be derived from diploid cells under in vitro and in vivo conditions, and that seems to arise through a concerted chromosome loss mechanism. Haploids undergo morphogenetic changes like those of diploids, including the yeast-hyphal transition, chlamydospore formation and a white-opaque switch that facilitates mating. Haploid opaque cells of opposite mating type mate efficiently to regenerate the diploid form, restoring heterozygosity and fitness. Homozygous diploids arise spontaneously by auto-diploidization, and both haploids and auto-diploids show a similar reduction in fitness, in vitro and in vivo, relative to heterozygous diploids, indicating that homozygous cell types are transient in mixed populations. Finally, we constructed stable haploid strains with multiple auxotrophies that will facilitate molecular and genetic analyses of this important pathogen.","Hickman, Meleah A.; Zeng, Guisheng; Forche, Anja; Hirakawa, Matthew P.; Abbey, Darren; Harrison, Benjamin D.; Wang, Yan-Ming; Su, Ching-hua; Bennett, Richard J.; Wang, Yue; Berman, Judith","Hickman, MA; Zeng, GS; Forche, A; Hirakawa, MP; Abbey, D; Harrison, BD; Wang, YM; Su, CH; Bennett, RJ; Wang, Y; Berman, J",55.0,"[Hickman, Meleah A.; Abbey, Darren; Harrison, Benjamin D.; Berman, Judith] Univ Minnesota, Dept Genet Cell Biol & Dev, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA; [Zeng, Guisheng; Wang, Yan-Ming; Wang, Yue] Agcy Sci Technol & Res, Inst Mol & Cell Biol, Singapore 138673, Singapore; [Forche, Anja] Bowdoin Coll, Brunswick, ME 04011 USA; [Hirakawa, Matthew P.; Bennett, Richard J.] Brown Univ, Dept Mol Microbiol & Immunol, Providence, RI 02912 USA; [Su, Ching-hua] Taipei Med Univ, Dept Microbiol & Immunol, Taipei, Taiwan; [Berman, Judith] Tel Aviv Univ, George Wise Fac Life Sci, Dept Mol Microbiol & Biotechnol, IL-69978 Ramat Aviv, Israel",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature11865,Article,1476-4687,jberman@umn.edu,59,"NRSA [F32GM096536-02]; National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) [R15-AI090633-01A1, R01 AI0624273, AI081560, AI081704, AI0624273]; training grant for Graduate Assistance in Areas of National Need [P200A100100]; National Institute of Dental & Craniofacial Research [T32DE007288]; Burroughs Wellcome Fund; Agency for Science, Technology, & Research, Singapore","We would like to thank M.

113,4930,429,"The development of collective long-range order by means of phase transitions occurs by the spontaneous breaking of fundamental symmetries. Magnetism is a consequence of broken time-reversal symmetry, whereas superfluidity results from broken gauge invariance. The broken symmetry that develops below 17.5 kelvin in the heavy-fermion compound URu2Si2 has long eluded such identification. Here we show that the recent observation of Ising quasiparticles in URu2Si2 results from a spinor order parameter that breaks double time-reversal symmetry, mixing states of integer and half-integer spin. Such 'hastatic' order hybridizes uranium-atom conduction electrons with Ising 5f(2) states to produce Ising quasiparticles; it accounts for the large entropy of condensation and the magnetic anomaly observed in torque magnetometry.

114,4951,450,"Optical irradiation accompanied by spontaneous anti-Stokes emission can lead to cooling of matter, in a phenomenon known as laser cooling, or optical refrigeration, which was proposed by Pringsheim in 1929(1). In gaseous matter, an extremely low temperature can be obtained in diluted atomic gases by Doppler cooling(2), and laser cooling of ultradense gas has been demonstrated by collisional redistribution of radiation(3). In solid-state materials, laser cooling is achieved by the annihilation of phonons, which are quanta of lattice vibrations, during anti-Stokes luminescence. Since the first experimental demonstration in glasses doped with rare-earth metals(4), considerable progress has been made, particularly in ytterbium-doped glasses or crystals: recently a record was set of cooling to about 110 kelvin from the ambient temperature, surpassing the thermoelectric Peltier cooler(5,6). It would be interesting to realize laser cooling in semiconductors, in which excitonic resonances dominate(7-9), rather than in systems doped with rare-earth metals, where atomic resonances dominate. However, so far no net cooling in semiconductors has been achieved despite much experimental(10-12) and theoretical(7-9,13,14) work, mainly on group-III-V gallium arsenide quantum wells. Here we report a net cooling by about 40 kelvin in a semiconductor using group-II-VI cadmium sulphide nanoribbons, or nanobelts, starting from 290 kelvin. We use a pump laser with a wavelength of 514 nanometres, and obtain an estimated cooling efficiency of about 1.3 per cent and an estimated cooling power of 180 microwatts. At 100 kelvin, 532-nm pumping leads to a net cooling of about 15 kelvin with a cooling efficiency of about 2.0 per cent. We attribute the net laser cooling in cadmium sulphide nanobelts to strong coupling between excitons and longitudinal optical phonons (LOPs), which allows the resonant annihilation of multiple LOPs in luminescence up-conversion processes, high external quantum efficiency and negligible background absorption. Our findings suggest that, alternatively, group-II-VI semiconductors with strong exciton-LOP coupling could be harnessed to achieve laser cooling and open the way to optical refrigeration based on semiconductors.","Zhang, Jun; Li, Dehui; Chen, Renjie; Xiong, Qihua","Zhang, J; Li, DH; Chen, RJ; Xiong, QH",504.0,"[Zhang, Jun; Li, Dehui; Chen, Renjie; Xiong, Qihua] Nanyang Technol Univ, Sch Phys & Math Sci, Div Phys & Appl Phys, Singapore 637371, Singapore; [Xiong, Qihua] Nanyang Technol Univ, Sch Elect & Elect Engn, Div Microelect, Singapore 639798, Singapore",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature11721,Article,,qihua@ntu.edu.sg,508,Singapore National Research Foundation [NRF-RF2009-06]; Singapore Ministry of Education [MOE2011-T2-2-051]; Nanyang Technological University [M58113004],We thank M.

115,5009,8,"Most echolocating bats exhibit a strong correlation between body size and the frequency of maximum energy in their echolocation calls (peak frequency), with smaller species using signals of higher frequency than larger ones(1,2). Size-signal allometry or acoustic detection constraints imposed on wavelength by preferred prey size have been used to explain this relationship(1,3). Here we propose the hypothesis that smaller bats emit higher frequencies to achieve directional sonar beams, and that variable beam width is critical for bats. Shorter wavelengths relative to the size of the emitter translate into more directional sound beams(4). Therefore, bats that emit their calls through their mouths should show a relationship between mouth size and wavelength, driving smaller bats to signals of higher frequency. We found that in a flight room mimicking a closed habitat, six aerial hawking vespertilionid species (ranging in size from 4 to 21 g, ref. 5) produced sonar beams of extraordinarily similar shape and volume. Each species had a directivity index of 11 +/- 1 dB (a half-amplitude angle of approximately 37 degrees) and an on-axis sound level of 108 +/- 4 dB sound pressure level referenced to 20 mu Pa root mean square at 10 cm. Thus all bats adapted their calls to achieve similar acoustic fields of view. We propose that the necessity for high directionality has been a key constraint on the evolution of echolocation, which explains the relationship between bat size and echolocation call frequency. Our results suggest that echolocation is a dynamic system that allows different species, regardless of their body size, to converge on optimal fields of view in response to habitat and task.","Jakobsen, Lasse; Ratcliffe, John M.; Surlykke, Annemarie","Jakobsen, L; Ratcliffe, JM; Surlykke, A",93.0,"[Jakobsen, Lasse; Ratcliffe, John M.; Surlykke, Annemarie] Univ So Denmark, Sound Commun Grp, Inst Biol, DK-5230 Odense M, Denmark",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature11664,Article,1476-4687,ams@biology.sdu.dk,96,"Danish Council for Natural Sciences (FNU), Carlsberg, Oticon; European Commission via the Seventh Framework Programme project ChiRoPing, Information Society Technologies [215370]","We thank H.

117,5200,199,"Grain boundaries in graphene are formed by the joining of islands during the initial growth stage, and these boundaries govern transport properties and related device performance(1,2). Although information on the atomic rearrangement at graphene grain boundaries can be obtained using transmission electron microscopy(3,4) and scanning tunnelling microscopy(2,5-8), large-scale information regarding the distribution of graphene grain boundaries is not easily accessible. Here we use optical microscopy to observe the grain boundaries of large-area graphene (grown on copper foil) directly, without transfer of the graphene. This imaging technique was realized by selectively oxidizing the underlying copper foil through graphene grain boundaries functionalized with O and OH radicals generated by ultraviolet irradiation under moisture-rich ambient conditions: selective diffusion of oxygen radicals through OH-functionalized defect sites was demonstrated by density functional calculations. The sheet resistance of large-area graphene decreased as the graphene grain sizes increased, but no strong correlation with the grain size of the copper was revealed, in contrast to a previous report(9). Furthermore, the influence of graphene grain boundaries on crack propagation (initialized by bending) and termination was clearly visualized using our technique. Our approach can be used as a simple protocol for evaluating the grain boundaries of other two-dimensional layered structures, such as boron nitride and exfoliated clays.","Dinh Loc Duong; Han, Gang Hee; Lee, Seung Mi; Gunes, Fethullah; Kim, Eun Sung; Kim, Sung Tae; Kim, Heetae; Quang Huy Ta; So, Kang Pyo; Yoon, Seok Jun; Chae, Seung Jin; Jo, Young Woo; Park, Min Ho; Chae, Sang Hoon; Lim, Seong Chu; Choi, Jae Young; Lee, Young Hee","Duong, DL; Han, GH; Lee, SM; Gunes, F; Kim, ES; Kim, ST; Kim, H; Ta, QH; So, KP; Yoon, SJ; Chae, SJ; Jo, YW; Park, MH; Chae, SH; Lim, SC; Choi, JY; Lee, YH",235.0,"[Dinh Loc Duong; Chae, Seung Jin; Lee, Young Hee] Sungkyunkwan Univ, Sungkyunkwan Adv Inst Nanotechnol, Suwon 440746, South Korea; [Dinh Loc Duong; Han, Gang Hee; Gunes, Fethullah; Kim, Eun Sung; Kim, Sung Tae; Kim, Heetae; Quang Huy Ta; So, Kang Pyo; Yoon, Seok Jun; Chae, Seung Jin; Jo, Young Woo; Chae, Sang Hoon; Lim, Seong Chu; Choi, Jae Young; Lee, Young Hee] Sungkyunkwan Univ, Graphene Ctr, Dept Energy Sci, Phys Div BK21, Suwon 440746, South Korea; [Lee, Seung Mi] Korea Res Inst Stand & Sci, Ctr Nanocharacterizat, Taejon 305340, South Korea; [Park, Min Ho] Sungkyunkwan Univ, Sch Adv Mat Sci & Engn, Suwon 440746, South Korea; [Choi, Jae Young] Samsung Adv Inst Technol SAIT, Graphene Ctr, Suwon 440600, South Korea",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature11562,Article,1476-4687,leeyoung@skku.edu,+,Star Faculty programme of the NRF of Korea [2010-0029653]; International Research and Development programme of the NRF of Korea [2011-00242]; WCU programme of the NRF of Korea [R31-2008-10029]; MEST,"This work was supported by the Star Faculty programme (2010-0029653), the International Research and Development programme (2011-00242) and the WCU programme (R31-2008-10029) of the NRF of Korea funded by MEST.",019IY,Y,N,CHEMICAL-VAPOR-DEPOSITION; POLYCRYSTALLINE GRAPHENE; OZONE; FILMS,7419.0,NATURE,Nature,English,30.0,No,"Gunes, Fethullah/0000-0002-7553-3608; Duong, Dinh Loc/0000-0002-4118-9589","MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",11-Oct,6.0,LONDON,23034653.0,J,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2012.0,"Lim, Seong Chu/A-6142-2013; Han, Gang Hee/P-7260-2014; Lee, Young Hee/A-5424-2013","Lee, YH (reprint author), Sungkyunkwan Univ, Sungkyunkwan Adv Inst Nanotechnol, Suwon 440746, South Korea.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,0028-0836,NATURE,165.0,Probing graphene grain boundaries with optical microscopy,17.0,417.0,WOS:000309733300044,199.0,490,Multidisciplinary Sciences,165,young hee,lee,54167.0,1,female,1.0,vZXxTu0AAAAJ,5,"(17929, ]",41067624,1
118,5331,330,"Biological dinitrogen fixation provides the largest input of nitrogen to the oceans, therefore exerting important control on the ocean's nitrogen inventory and primary productivity(1-3). Nitrogen-isotope data from ocean sediments suggest that the marine-nitrogen inventory has been balanced for the past 3,000 years (ref. 4). Producing a balanced marine-nitrogen budget based on direct measurements has proved difficult, however, with nitrogen loss exceeding the gain from dinitrogen fixation by approximately 200 TgNyr(-1) (refs 5, 6). Here we present data from the Atlantic Ocean and show that the most widely used method of measuring oceanic N-2-fixation rates(7) underestimates the contribution of N-2-fixing microorganisms (diazotrophs) relative to a newly developed method(8). Using molecular techniques to quantify the abundance of specific clades of diazotrophs in parallel with rates of N-15(2) incorporation into particulate organic matter, we suggest that the difference between N-2-fixation rates measured with the established method(7) and those measured with the new method8 can be related to the composition of the diazotrophic community. Our data show that in areas dominated by Trichodesmium, the established method underestimates N-2-fixation rates by an average of 62%. We also find that the newly developed method yields N-2-fixation rates more than six times higher than those from the established method when unicellular, symbiotic cyanobacteria and c-proteobacteria dominate the diazotrophic community. On the basis of average areal rates measured over the Atlantic Ocean, we calculated basin-wide N-2-fixation rates of 14 +/- 1 Tg N yr(-1) and 24 +/- 1 Tg N yr(-1) for the established and new methods, respectively. If our findings can be extrapolated to other ocean basins, this suggests that the global marine N-2-fixation rate derived from direct measurements may increase from 103 +/- 8 Tg N yr(-1) to 177 +/- 8 Tg N yr(-1), and that the contribution of N-2 fixers other than Trichodesmium is much more significant than was previously thought.","Grosskopf, Tobias; Mohr, Wiebke; Baustian, Tina; Schunck, Harald; Gill, Diana; Kuypers, Marcel M.

119,5338,337,"Cardiac hypertrophy is initiated as an adaptive response to sustained overload but progresses pathologically as heart failure ensues(1). Here we report that genetic loss of APJ, a G-protein-coupled receptor, confers resistance to chronic pressure overload by markedly reducing myocardial hypertrophy and heart failure. In contrast, mice lacking apelin (the endogenous APJ ligand) remain sensitive, suggesting an apelin-independent function of APJ. Freshly isolated APJ-null cardiomyocytes exhibit an attenuated response to stretch, indicating that APJ is a mechanosensor. Activation of APJ by stretch increases cardiomyocyte cell size and induces molecular markers of hypertrophy. Whereas apelin stimulates APJ to activate G alpha(i) and elicits a protective response, stretch signals in an APJ-dependent, G-protein-independent fashion to induce hypertrophy. Stretch-mediated hypertrophy is prevented by knockdown of beta-arrestins or by pharmacological doses of apelin acting through G alpha(i). Taken together, our data indicate that APJ is a bifunctional receptor for both mechanical stretch and the endogenous peptide apelin. By sensing the balance between these stimuli, APJ occupies a pivotal point linking sustained overload to cardiomyocyte hypertrophy.","Scimia, Maria Cecilia; Hurtado, Cecilia; Ray, Saugata; Metzler, Scott; Wei, Ke; Wang, Jianming; Woods, Chris E.; Purcell, Nicole H.; Catalucci, Daniele; Akasaka, Takeshi; Bueno, Orlando F.; Vlasuk, George P.; Kaliman, Perla; Bodmer, Rolf; Smith, Layton H.; Ashley, Euan; Mercola, Mark; Brown, Joan Heller; Ruiz-Lozano, Pilar","Scimia, MC; Hurtado, C; Ray, S; Metzler, S; Wei, K; Wang, JM; Woods, CE; Purcell, NH; Catalucci, D; Akasaka, T; Bueno, OF; Vlasuk, GP; Kaliman, P; Bodmer, R; Smith, LH; Ashley, E; Mercola, M; Brown, JH; Ruiz-Lozano, P",394.0,"[Scimia, Maria Cecilia; Hurtado, Cecilia; Ray, Saugata; Wei, Ke; Wang, Jianming; Akasaka, Takeshi; Bodmer, Rolf; Smith, Layton H.; Mercola, Mark; Ruiz-Lozano, Pilar] Sanford Burnham Med Res Inst, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; [Metzler, Scott; Ruiz-Lozano, Pilar] Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Dept Pediat, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Woods, Chris E.; Ashley, Euan] Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Dept Med, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Purcell, Nicole H.; Brown, Joan Heller] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Pharmacol, San Diego, CA 92103 USA; [Catalucci, Daniele] CNR, Biomed & Genet Res Inst, I-20138 Milan, Italy; [Catalucci, Daniele] Humanitas Clin & Res Ctr, I-20089 Milan, Italy; [Bueno, Orlando F.; Vlasuk, George P.] Wyeth Pharmaceut, Madison, NJ USA; [Kaliman, Perla] Inst Biomed Res August Pi & Sunyer IDIBAPS, E-08036 Barcelona, Spain",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature11263,Article,1476-4687,prlozano@stanford.edu,398,"Wyeth Sponsored Research Agreement; National Institutes of Health (NIH) [R01HL086879, R37HL059502, R01HL083463, R01HL054732, NS05422, RO1HL28143, P01 HL085577]; Sanford Children's Center; Ellison Medical Foundation; Muscular Dystrophy association; Florida Department of Health [06-NIR-09]; California Institute for Regenerative Medicine; Italian Ministry of Research and Education; Italian Society of Cardiology (SIC and Sanofi-Aventis Foundation); American Heart Association Postdoctoral Award; Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovacion (MICINN) Spain [SAF2010-15050]","We are thankful to N.

120,5386,385,"Tissue development and regeneration depend on cell-cell interactions and signals that target stem cells and their immediate progeny(1). However, the cellular behaviours that lead to a properly regenerated tissue are not well understood. Using a new, non-invasive, intravital two-photon imaging approach we study physiological hair-follicle regeneration over time in live mice. By these means we have monitored the behaviour of epithelial stem cells and their progeny(2-4) during physiological hair regeneration and addressed how the mesenchyme(5) influences their behaviour. Consistent with earlier studies(6), stem cells are quiescent during the initial stages of hair regeneration, whereas the progeny are more actively dividing. Moreover, stem cell progeny divisions are spatially organized within follicles. In addition to cell divisions, coordinated cell movements of the progeny allow the rapid expansion of the hair follicle. Finally, we show the requirement of the mesenchyme for hair regeneration through targeted cell ablation and long-term tracking of live hair follicles. Thus, we have established an in vivo approach that has led to the direct observation of cellular mechanisms of growth regulation within the hair follicle and that has enabled us to precisely investigate functional requirements of hair-follicle components during the process of physiological regeneration.","Rompolas, Panteleimon; Deschene, Elizabeth R.; Zito, Giovanni; Gonzalez, David G.; Saotome, Ichiko; Haberman, Ann M.; Greco, Valentina","Rompolas, P; Deschene, ER; Zito, G; Gonzalez, DG; Saotome, I; Haberman, AM; Greco, V",496.0,"[Rompolas, Panteleimon; Deschene, Elizabeth R.; Zito, Giovanni; Saotome, Ichiko; Greco, Valentina] Yale Univ, Sch Med, Yale Canc Ctr, Dept Genet,Dept Dermatol,Yale Stem Cell Ctr, New Haven, CT 06510 USA; [Gonzalez, David G.; Haberman, Ann M.] Yale Univ, Sch Med, Dept Lab Med, New Haven, CT 06510 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature11218,Article,,valentina.greco@yale.edu,U1600,"James Hudson Brown-Alexander Brown Coxe postdoctoral fellowship; National Institute of General Medical Sciences, US National Institutes of Health, Public Health Service; American Skin Association; American Cancer Society; Yale Rheumatologic Disease Research Core Center [NIH P30AR053495]","We are grateful to A.

121,5394,393,"To characterize somatic alterations in colorectal carcinoma, we conducted a genome-scale analysis of 276 samples, analysing exome sequence, DNA copy number, promoter methylation and messenger RNA and microRNA expression. A subset of these samples (97) underwent low-depth-of-coverage whole-genome sequencing. In total, 16% of colorectal carcinomas were found to be hypermutated: three-quarters of these had the expected high microsatellite instability, usually with hypermethylation and MLH1 silencing, and one-quarter had somatic mismatch-repair gene and polymerase e (POLE) mutations. Excluding the hypermutated cancers, colon and rectum cancers were found to have considerably similar patterns of genomic alteration. Twenty-four genes were significantly mutated, and in addition to the expected APC, TP53, SMAD4, PIK3CA and KRAS mutations, we found frequent mutations in ARID1A, SOX9 and FAM123B. Recurrent copy-number alterations include potentially drug-targetable amplifications of ERBB2 and newly discovered amplification of IGF2. Recurrent chromosomal translocations include the fusion of NAV2 and WNT pathway member TCF7L1. Integrative analyses suggest new markers for aggressive colorectal carcinoma and an important role for MYC-directed transcriptional activation and repression.","Muzny, Donna M.; Bainbridge, Matthew N.; Chang, Kyle; Dinh, Huyen H.; Drummond, Jennifer A.; Fowler, Gerald; Kovar, Christie L.; Lewis, Lora R.; Morgan, Margaret B.; Newsham, Irene F.; Reid, Jeffrey G.; Santibanez, Jireh; Shinbrot, Eve; Trevino, Lisa R.; Wu, Yuan-Qing; Wang, Min; Gunaratne, Preethi; Donehower, Lawrence A.; Creighton, Chad J.; Wheeler, David A.; Gibbs, Richard A.; Lawrence, Michael S.; Voet, Douglas; Jing, Rui; Cibulskis, Kristian; Sivachenko, Andrey; Stojanov, Petar; McKenna, Aaron; Lander, Eric S.; Gabriel, Stacey; Getz, Gad; Ding, Li; Fulton, Robert S.; Koboldt, Daniel C.; Wylie, Todd; Walker, Jason; Dooling, David J.; Fulton, Lucinda; Delehaunty, Kim D.; Fronick, Catrina C.; Demeter, Ryan; Mardis, Elaine R.; Wilson, Richard K.; Chu, Andy; Chun, Hye-Jung E.; Mungall, Andrew J.; Pleasance, Erin; Robertson, A.

122,5414,413,"Living organisms have unique homeostatic abilities, maintaining tight control of their local environment through interconversions of chemical and mechanical energy and self-regulating feedback loops organized hierarchically across many length scales(1-7). In contrast, most synthetic materials are incapable of continuous self-monitoring and self-regulating behaviour owing to their limited single-directional chemomechanical(7-12) or mechanochemical(13,14) modes. Applying the concept of homeostasis to the design of autonomous materials(15) would have substantial impacts in areas ranging from medical implants that help stabilize bodily functions to 'smart' materials that regulate energy usage(2,16,17). Here we present a versatile strategy for creating self-regulating, self-powered, homeostatic materials capable of precisely tailored chemo-mechanochemical feedback loops on the nano- or microscale. We design a bilayer system with hydrogel-supported, catalyst-bearing microstructures, which are separated from a reactant-containing 'nutrient' layer. Reconfiguration of the gel in response to a stimulus induces the reversible actuation of the microstructures into and out of the nutrient layer, and serves as a highly precise 'on/off' switch for chemical reactions. We apply this design to trigger organic, inorganic and biochemical reactions that undergo reversible, repeatable cycles synchronized with the motion of the microstructures and the driving external chemical stimulus. By exploiting a continuous feedback loop between various exothermic catalytic reactions in the nutrient layer and the mechanical action of the temperature-responsive gel, we then create exemplary autonomous, self-sustained homeostatic systems that maintain a user-defined parameter-temperature-in a narrow range. The experimental results are validated using computational modelling that qualitatively captures the essential features of the self-regulating behaviour and provides additional criteria for the optimization of the homeostatic function, subsequently confirmed experimentally. This design is highly customizable owing to the broad choice of chemistries, tunable mechanics and its physical simplicity, and may lead to a variety of applications in autonomous systems with chemo-mechano-chemical transduction at their core.","He, Ximin; Aizenberg, Michael; Kuksenok, Olga; Zarzar, Lauren D.; Shastri, Ankita; Balazs, Anna C.; Aizenberg, Joanna","He, XM; Aizenberg, M; Kuksenok, O; Zarzar, LD; Shastri, A; Balazs, AC; Aizenberg, J",214.0,"[He, Ximin; Aizenberg, Joanna] Harvard Univ, Sch Engn & Appl Sci, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [He, Ximin; Aizenberg, Michael; Aizenberg, Joanna] Harvard Univ, Wyss Inst Biologically Inspired Engn, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Kuksenok, Olga; Balazs, Anna C.] Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Chem & Petr Engn, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA; [Zarzar, Lauren D.; Shastri, Ankita; Aizenberg, Joanna] Harvard Univ, Dept Chem & Chem Biol, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature11223,Article,,jaiz@seas.harvard.edu,218,US DOE [DE-SC0005247]; US NSF [CMMI-1124839],"We thank P.

123,5538,37,"Strong and sustained winds on Mars have been considered rare, on the basis of surface meteorology measurements and global circulation models(1,2), raising the question of whether the abundant dunes and evidence for wind erosion seen on the planet are a current process. Recent studies(3-6) showed sand activity, but could not determine whether entire dunes were moving-implying large sand fluxes-or whether more localized and surficial changes had occurred. Here we present measurements of the migration rate of sand ripples and dune lee fronts at the Nili Patera dune field. We show that the dunes are near steady state, with their entire volumes composed of mobile sand. The dunes have unexpectedly high sand fluxes, similar, for example, to those in Victoria Valley, Antarctica, implying that rates of landscape modification on Mars and Earth are similar.","Bridges, N.

124,5596,95,"IL-17-producing CD4(+) T helper cells (T(H)17) have been extensively investigated in mouse models of autoimmunity(1). However, the requirements for differentiation and the properties of pathogen-induced human T(H)17 cells remain poorly defined. Using an approach that combines the in vitro priming of naive T cells with the ex vivo analysis of memory T cells, we describe here two types of human T(H)17 cells with distinct effector function and differentiation requirements. Candida albicans-specific T(H)17 cells produced IL-17 and IFN-gamma, but no IL-10, whereas Staphylococcus aureus-specific T(H)17 cells produced IL-17 and could produce IL-10 upon restimulation. IL-6, IL-23 and IL-1 beta contributed to T(H)17 differentiation induced by both pathogens, but IL-1 beta was essential in C. albicans-induced T(H)17 differentiation to counteract the inhibitory activity of IL-12 and to prime IL-17/IFN-gamma double-producing cells. In addition, IL-1 beta inhibited IL-10 production in differentiating and in memory T(H)17 cells, whereas blockade of IL-1 beta in vivo led to increased IL-10 production by memory T(H)17 cells. We also show that, after restimulation, T(H)17 cells transiently downregulated IL-17 production through a mechanism that involved IL-2-induced activation of STAT5 and decreased expression of ROR-gamma t. Taken together these findings demonstrate that by eliciting different cytokines C. albicans and S. aureus prime T(H)17 cells that produce either IFN-gamma or IL-10, and identify IL-1 beta and IL-2 as pro-and anti-inflammatory regulators of T(H)17 cells both at priming and in the effector phase.","Zielinski, Christina E.; Mele, Federico; Aschenbrenner, Dominik; Jarrossay, David; Ronchi, Francesca; Gattorno, Marco; Monticelli, Silvia; Lanzavecchia, Antonio; Sallusto, Federica","Zielinski, CE; Mele, F; Aschenbrenner, D; Jarrossay, D; Ronchi, F; Gattorno, M; Monticelli, S; Lanzavecchia, A; Sallusto, F",514.0,"[Zielinski, Christina E.; Mele, Federico; Aschenbrenner, Dominik; Jarrossay, David; Ronchi, Francesca; Monticelli, Silvia; Lanzavecchia, Antonio; Sallusto, Federica] Inst Res Biomed, CH-6500 Bellinzona, Switzerland; [Gattorno, Marco] G Gaslini Sci Inst, I-16147 Genoa, Italy; [Lanzavecchia, Antonio] ETH, Inst Microbiol, CH-8093 Zurich, Switzerland",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature10957,Article,,christina.zielinski@charite.de; federica.sallusto@irb.usi.ch,U139,"German Research Foundation (DFG) [Zi 1262/1-1]; Swiss National Science Foundation [131092, 126027]; Institute of Arthritis Research (IAR); Helmut Horten Foundation","We thank O.

125,5663,162,"Histones are ubiquitinated in response toDNAdouble-strand breaks (DSB), promoting recruitment of repair proteins to chromatin(1). UBC13 (also known as UBE2N) is a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2) that heterodimerizes withUEV1A(2) (also knownasUBE2V1) and synthesizes K63-linked polyubiquitin (K63Ub) chains at DSB sites in concert with the ubiquitin ligase (E3), RNF168 (ref. 3). K63Ub synthesis is regulated in a non-canonicalmanner by the deubiquitinating enzyme, OTUB1 (OTU domain-containing ubiquitin aldehydebinding protein 1), which binds preferentially to the UBC13 similar to Ub thiolester(4). Residues amino-terminal to the OTU domain, which had been implicated in ubiquitin binding(4), are required for binding to UBC13 similar to Ub and inhibition of K63Ub synthesis(5). Here we describe structural and biochemical studies elucidating how OTUB1 inhibits UBC13 and other E2 enzymes. We unexpectedly find that OTUB1 binding to UBC13 Ub is allosterically regulated by free ubiquitin, which binds to a second site in OTUB1 and increases its affinity for UBC13 similar to Ub, while at the same time disrupting interactions with UEV1A in a manner that depends on the OTUB1 N terminus. Crystal structures of an OTUB1-UBC13 complex and of OTUB1 bound to ubiquitin aldehyde and a chemical UBC13 similar to Ub conjugate show that binding of free ubiquitin to OTUB1 triggers conformational changes in the OTU domain and formation of a ubiquitinbinding helix in the N terminus, thus promoting binding of the conjugated donor ubiquitin in UBC13 similar to Ub to OTUB1. The donor ubiquitin thus cannot interact with the E2 enzyme, which has been shown to be important for ubiquitin transfer(6,7). The N-terminal helix of OTUB1 is positioned to interfere with UEV1A binding to UBC13, as well as with attack on the thiolester by an acceptor ubiquitin, thereby inhibiting K63Ub synthesis. OTUB1 binding also occludes the RING E3 binding site on UBC13, thus providing a further component of inhibition. The general features of the inhibition mechanism explain how OTUB1 inhibits other E2 enzymes4 in a non-catalytic manner.","Wiener, Reuven; Zhang, Xiangbin; Wang, Tao; Wolberger, Cynthia","Wiener, R; Zhang, XB; Wang, T; Wolberger, C",618.0,"[Wiener, Reuven; Zhang, Xiangbin; Wang, Tao; Wolberger, Cynthia] Johns Hopkins Univ, Sch Med, Dept Biophys & Biophys Chem, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA; [Wiener, Reuven; Zhang, Xiangbin; Wang, Tao; Wolberger, Cynthia] Johns Hopkins Univ, Sch Med, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature10911,Article,,cwolberg@jhmi.edu,U143,"US Department of Energy, Basic Energy Sciences, Office of Science [DE-AC02-06CH11357]; National Cancer Institute [Y1-CO-1020]; National Institute of General Medical Science [Y1-GM-1104]","We thank E.

127,5773,272,"Aneuploidy-the state of having uneven numbers of chromosomes-is a hallmark of cancer(1) and a feature identified in yeast from diverse habitats(2-5). Recent studies have shown that aneuploidy is a form of large-effect mutation that is able to confer adaptive phenotypes under diverse stress conditions(2,6). Here we investigate whether pleiotropic stress could induce aneuploidy in budding yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisae). We show that whereas diverse stress conditions can induce an increase in chromosome instability, proteotoxic stress, caused by transient Hsp90 (also known as Hsp82 or Hsc82) inhibition or heat shock, markedly increased chromosome instability to produce a cell population with high karyotype diversity. The induced chromosome instability is linked to an evolutionarily conserved role for the Hsp90 chaperone complex in kinetochore assembly(7,8). Continued growth in the presence of an Hsp90 inhibitor resulted in the emergence of drug-resistant colonies with chromosome XV gain. This drug-resistance phenotype is a quantitative trait involving copy number increases of at least two genes located on chromosome XV. Shortterm exposure to Hsp90 stress potentiated fast adaptation to unrelated cytotoxic compounds by means of different aneuploid chromosome stoichiometries. These findings demonstrate that aneuploidy is a form of stress-inducible mutation in eukaryotes, capable of fuelling rapid phenotypic evolution and drug resistance, and reveal a new role for Hsp90 in regulating the emergence of adaptive traits under stress.","Chen, Guangbo; Bradford, William D.; Seidel, Chris W.; Li, Rong","Chen, GB; Bradford, WD; Seidel, CW; Li, R",246.0,"[Chen, Guangbo; Bradford, William D.; Seidel, Chris W.; Li, Rong] Stowers Inst Med Res, Kansas City, MO 64110 USA; [Chen, Guangbo; Li, Rong] Univ Kansas, Med Ctr, Dept Mol & Integrat Physiol, Kansas City, KS 66160 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature10795,Article,,rli@stowers.org,250,National Institutes of Health [RO1GM059964],"We thank N.

129,5802,301,"Exercise has beneficial effects on human health, including protection against metabolic disorders such as diabetes(1). However, the cellular mechanisms underlying these effects are incompletely understood. The lysosomal degradation pathway, autophagy, is an intracellular recycling system that functions during basal conditions in organelle and protein quality control(2). During stress, increased levels of autophagy permit cells to adapt to changing nutritional and energy demands through protein catabolism(3). Moreover, in animal models, autophagy protects against diseases such as cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, infections, inflammatory diseases, ageing and insulin resistance(4-6). Here we show that acute exercise induces autophagy in skeletal and cardiac muscle of fed mice. To investigate the role of exercise-mediated autophagy in vivo, we generated mutant mice that show normal levels of basal autophagy but are deficient in stimulus (exercise- or starvation)-induced autophagy. These mice (termed BCL2 AAA mice) contain knock-in mutations in BCL2 phosphorylation sites (Thr69Ala, Ser70Ala and Ser84Ala) that prevent stimulus-induced disruption of the BCL2-beclin-1 complex and autophagy activation. BCL2 AAA mice show decreased endurance and altered glucose metabolism during acute exercise, as well as impaired chronic exercise-mediated protection against high-fat-diet-induced glucose intolerance. Thus, exercise induces autophagy, BCL2 is a crucial regulator of exercise- (and starvation)-induced autophagy in vivo, and autophagy induction may contribute to the beneficial metabolic effects of exercise.","He, Congcong; Bassik, Michael C.; Moresi, Viviana; Sun, Kai; Wei, Yongjie; Zou, Zhongju; An, Zhenyi; Loh, Joy; Fisher, Jill; Sun, Qihua; Korsmeyer, Stanley; Packer, Milton; May, Herman I.; Hill, Joseph A.; Virgin, Herbert W.; Gilpin, Christopher; Xiao, Guanghua; Bassel-Duby, Rhonda; Scherer, Philipp E.; Levine, Beth","He, CC; Bassik, MC; Moresi, V; Sun, K; Wei, YJ; Zou, ZJ; An, ZY; Loh, J; Fisher, J; Sun, QH; Korsmeyer, S; Packer, M; May, HI; Hill, JA; Virgin, HW; Gilpin, C; Xiao, GH; Bassel-Duby, R; Scherer, PE; Levine, B",511.0,"[He, Congcong; Wei, Yongjie; Zou, Zhongju; An, Zhenyi; Sun, Qihua; Levine, Beth] Univ Texas SW Med Ctr Dallas, Ctr Autophagy Res, Dallas, TX 75390 USA; [He, Congcong; Sun, Kai; Wei, Yongjie; Zou, Zhongju; An, Zhenyi; Sun, Qihua; May, Herman I.; Hill, Joseph A.; Scherer, Philipp E.; Levine, Beth] Univ Texas SW Med Ctr Dallas, Dept Internal Med, Dallas, TX 75390 USA; [He, Congcong; Wei, Yongjie; Zou, Zhongju; Levine, Beth] Univ Texas SW Med Ctr Dallas, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Dallas, TX 75390 USA; [Bassik, Michael C.; Fisher, Jill; Korsmeyer, Stanley] Dana Farber Canc Inst, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Moresi, Viviana; Bassel-Duby, Rhonda] Univ Texas SW Med Ctr Dallas, Dept Mol Biol, Dallas, TX 75390 USA; [Sun, Kai; Scherer, Philipp E.] Univ Texas SW Med Ctr Dallas, Touchstone Diabet Ctr, Dallas, TX 75390 USA; [Loh, Joy; Virgin, Herbert W.] Washington Univ, Dept Pathol & Immunol, Sch Med, St Louis, MO USA; [Packer, Milton; Xiao, Guanghua] Univ Texas SW Med Ctr Dallas, Dept Clin Sci, Dallas, TX 75390 USA; [Gilpin, Christopher] Univ Texas SW Med Ctr Dallas, Dept Cell Biol, Dallas, TX 75390 USA; [Levine, Beth] Univ Texas SW Med Ctr Dallas, Dept Microbiol, Dallas, TX 75390 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature10758,Article,,beth.levine@utsouthwestern.edu,U126,"National Institutes of Health [RO1 CA109618, ROI HL080244, ROI HL090842, ROI AI084887, RCI DK086629, RO1 CA112023, 1PO1 DK0887761]","We thank the UT Southwestern Mouse Metabolic Phenotyping Core and E.

130,5881,380,"SAMHD1, an analogue of the murine interferon (IFN)-gamma-induced gene Mg11 (ref. 1), has recently been identified as a human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) restriction factor that blocks early-stage virus replication in dendritic and other myeloid cells(2,3) and is the target of the lentiviral protein Vpx, which can relieve HIV-1 restriction(4-7). SAMHD1 is also associated with Aicardi-Goutieres syndrome (AGS), an inflammatory encephalopathy characterized by chronic cerebrospinal fluid lymphocytosis and elevated levels of the antiviral cytokine IFN-alpha(8). The pathology associated with AGS resembles congenital viral infection, such as transplacentally acquired HIV. Here we show that human SAMHD1 is a potent dGTP-stimulated triphosphohydrolase that converts deoxynucleoside triphosphates to the constituent deoxynucleoside and inorganic triphosphate. The crystal structure of the catalytic core of SAMHD1 reveals that the protein is dimeric and indicates a molecular basis for dGTP stimulation of catalytic activity against dNTPs. We propose that SAMHD1, which is highly expressed in dendritic cells, restricts HIV-1 replication by hydrolysing the majority of cellular dNTPs, thus inhibiting reverse transcription and viral complementary DNA (cDNA) synthesis.","Goldstone, David C.; Ennis-Adeniran, Valerie; Hedden, Joseph J.; Groom, Harriet C.

132,5914,413,"Tissue wounding induces the rapid recruitment of leukocytes(1). Wounds and tumours-a type of 'unhealed wound'(2)-generate hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) through an NADPH oxidase (NOX). This extracellular H2O2 mediates recruitment of leukocytes, particularly the first responders of innate immunity, neutrophils, to injured tissue(3-6). However, the sensor that neutrophils use to detect the redox state at wounds is unknown. Here we identify the Src family kinase (SFK) Lyn as a redox sensor that mediates initial neutrophil recruitment to wounds in zebrafish larvae. Lyn activation in neutrophils is dependent on wound-derived H2O2 after tissue injury, and inhibition of Lyn attenuates neutrophil wound recruitment. Inhibition of SFKs also disrupted H2O2-mediated chemotaxis of primary human neutrophils. In vitro analysis identified a single cysteine residue, C466, as being responsible for direct oxidation-mediated activation of Lyn. Furthermore, transgenic-tissue-specific reconstitution with wild-type Lyn and a cysteine mutant revealed that Lyn C466 is important for the neutrophil wound response and downstream signalling in vivo. This is the first identification, to our knowledge, of a physiological redox sensor that mediates leukocyte wound attraction in multicellular organisms.","Yoo, Sa Kan; Starnes, Taylor W.; Deng, Qing; Huttenlocher, Anna","Yoo, SK; Starnes, TW; Deng, Q; Huttenlocher, A",109.0,"[Starnes, Taylor W.; Deng, Qing; Huttenlocher, Anna] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Med Microbiol & Immunol, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Yoo, Sa Kan] Univ Wisconsin, Program Cellular & Mol Biol, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Huttenlocher, Anna] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Pediat, Madison, WI 53706 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature10632,Article,,huttenlocher@wisc.edu,U278,"American Heart Association [11PRE4890041]; National Institutes of Health [GM074827, 5T32 HL07899]; UW MSTP","We thank K.

133,5915,414,"Selective autophagy involves the recognition and targeting of specific cargo, such as damaged organelles, misfolded proteins, or invading pathogens for lysosomal destruction(1-4). Yeast genetic screens have identified proteins required for different forms of selective autophagy, including cytoplasm-to-vacuole targeting, pexophagy and mitophagy, and mammalian genetic screens have identified proteins required for autophagy regulation(5). However, there have been no systematic approaches to identify molecular determinants of selective autophagy in mammalian cells. Here, to identify mammalian genes required for selective autophagy, we performed a high-content, image-based, genome-wide small interfering RNA screen to detect genes required for the colocalization of Sindbis virus capsid protein with autophagolysosomes. We identified 141 candidate genes required for viral autophagy, which were enriched for cellular pathways related to messenger RNA processing, interferon signalling, vesicle trafficking, cytoskeletal motor function and metabolism. Ninety-six of these genes were also required for Parkin-mediated mitophagy, indicating that common molecular determinants may be involved in autophagic targeting of viral nucleocapsids and autophagic targeting of damaged mitochondria. Murine embryonic fibroblasts lacking one of these gene products, the C2-domain containing protein, SMURF1, are deficient in the autophagosomal targeting of Sindbis and herpes simplex viruses and in the clearance of damaged mitochondria. Moreover, SMURF1-deficient mice accumulate damaged mitochondria in the heart, brain and liver. Thus, our study identifies candidate determinants of selective autophagy, and defines SMURF1 as a newly recognized mediator of both viral autophagy and mitophagy.","Orvedahl, Anthony; Sumpter, Rhea, Jr.; Xiao, Guanghua; Ng, Aylwin; Zou, Zhongju; Tang, Yi; Narimatsu, Masahiro; Gilpin, Christopher; Sun, Qihua; Roth, Michael; Forst, Christian V.; Wrana, Jeffrey L.; Zhang, Ying E.; Luby-Phelps, Katherine; Xavier, Ramnik J.; Xie, Yang; Levine, Beth","Orvedahl, A; Sumpter, R; Xiao, GH; Ng, A; Zou, ZJ; Tang, Y; Narimatsu, M; Gilpin, C; Sun, QH; Roth, M; Forst, CV; Wrana, JL; Zhang, YE; Luby-Phelps, K; Xavier, RJ; Xie, Y; Levine, B",113.0,"[Orvedahl, Anthony; Sumpter, Rhea, Jr.; Zou, Zhongju; Sun, Qihua; Levine, Beth] Univ Texas SW Med Ctr Dallas, Dept Internal Med, Dallas, TX 75390 USA; [Orvedahl, Anthony; Levine, Beth] Univ Texas SW Med Ctr Dallas, Dept Microbiol, Dallas, TX 75390 USA; [Sumpter, Rhea, Jr.; Zou, Zhongju; Sun, Qihua; Levine, Beth] Univ Texas SW Med Ctr Dallas, Ctr Autophagy Res, Dallas, TX 75390 USA; [Xiao, Guanghua; Forst, Christian V.; Xie, Yang] Univ Texas SW Med Ctr Dallas, Dept Clin Sci, Dallas, TX 75390 USA; [Ng, Aylwin; Xavier, Ramnik J.] Harvard Univ, Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Sch Med, Ctr Computat & Integrat Biol, Boston, MA 02114 USA; [Ng, Aylwin; Xavier, Ramnik J.] Harvard Univ, Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Sch Med, Gastrointestinal Unit, Boston, MA 02114 USA; [Ng, Aylwin; Xavier, Ramnik J.] Broad Inst Harvard, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; [Ng, Aylwin; Xavier, Ramnik J.] MIT, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; [Zou, Zhongju; Levine, Beth] Univ Texas SW Med Ctr Dallas, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Dallas, TX 75390 USA; [Tang, Yi; Zhang, Ying E.] NCI, Cellular & Mol Biol Lab, Ctr Canc Res, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Narimatsu, Masahiro; Wrana, Jeffrey L.] Mt Sinai Hosp, Samuel Lunenfeld Res Inst, Ctr Syst Biol, Toronto, ON M5G 1X5, Canada; [Gilpin, Christopher; Luby-Phelps, Katherine] Univ Texas SW Med Ctr Dallas, Dept Cell Biol, Dallas, TX 75390 USA; [Roth, Michael] Univ Texas SW Med Ctr Dallas, Dept Biochem, Dallas, TX 75390 USA; [Roth, Michael; Xie, Yang; Levine, Beth] Univ Texas SW Med Ctr Dallas, Harold C Simmons Comprehens Canc Ctr, Dallas, TX 75390 USA; [Wrana, Jeffrey L.] Univ Toronto, Dept Mol Genet, Toronto, ON M5S 3E1, Canada",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature10546,Article,,beth.levine@utsouthwestern.edu,117,"NIH [AI109617, CA84254, UL1 RR024982, AI062773, DK83756, DK086502, DK043351]; NSF [DMS-0907562]; Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute","We thank M.

134,5916,415,"The embryonic pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) isoform is highly expressed in human cancer. In contrast to the established role of PKM2 in aerobic glycolysis or the Warburg effect(1-3), its non-metabolic functions remain elusive. Here we demonstrate, in human cancer cells, that epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) activation induces translocation of PKM2, but not PKM1, into the nucleus, where K433 of PKM2 binds to c-Src-phosphorylated Y333 of beta-catenin. This interaction is required for both proteins to be recruited to the CCND1 promoter, leading to HDAC3 removal from the promoter, histone H3 acetylation and cyclin D1 expression. PKM2-dependent beta-catenin transactivation is instrumental in EGFR-promoted tumour cell proliferation and brain tumour development. In addition, positive correlations have been identified between c-Src activity, beta-catenin Y333 phosphorylation and PKM2 nuclear accumulation in human glioblastoma specimens. Furthermore, levels of beta-catenin phosphorylation and nuclear PKM2 have been correlated with grades of glioma malignancy and prognosis. These findings reveal that EGF induces beta-catenin transactivation via a mechanism distinct from that induced by Wnt/Wingless(4) and highlight the essential non-metabolic functions of PKM2 in EGFR-promoted beta-catenin transactivation, cell proliferation and tumorigenesis.","Yang, Weiwei; Xia, Yan; Ji, Haitao; Zheng, Yanhua; Liang, Ji; Huang, Wenhua; Gao, Xiang; Aldape, Kenneth; Lu, Zhimin","Yang, WW; Xia, Y; Ji, HT; Zheng, YH; Liang, J; Huang, WH; Gao, X; Aldape, K; Lu, ZM",118.0,"[Yang, Weiwei; Xia, Yan; Ji, Haitao; Zheng, Yanhua; Liang, Ji; Lu, Zhimin] Univ Texas MD Anderson Canc Ctr, Brain Tumor Ctr, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Yang, Weiwei; Xia, Yan; Ji, Haitao; Zheng, Yanhua; Liang, Ji; Lu, Zhimin] Univ Texas MD Anderson Canc Ctr, Dept Neurooncol, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Huang, Wenhua] Jiaxing Xinda Biotechnol Co, Jiaxing 314000, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Gao, Xiang] Nanjing Univ, Model Anim Res Ctr, State Key Lab Pharmaceut Biotechnol, Nanjing 210061, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Aldape, Kenneth] Univ Texas MD Anderson Canc Ctr, Dept Pathol, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Lu, Zhimin] Univ Texas MD Anderson Canc Ctr, Dept Mol & Cellular Oncol, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Lu, Zhimin] Univ Texas Houston, Grad Sch Biomed Sci Houston, Houston, TX 77030 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature10598,Article,,zhiminlu@mdanderson.org,U289,"National Cancer Institute [5R01CA109035, 5 P50 CA127001-03, CA16672]; Cancer Prevention and Research Institute of Texas (CPRIT) [RP110252]; American Cancer Society [RSG-09-277-01-CSM]; University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center","We thank T.

136,5937,436,"Chromatin modifiers regulate lifespan in several organisms, raising the question of whether changes in chromatin states in the parental generation could be incompletely reprogrammed in the next generation and thereby affect the lifespan of descendants. The histone H3 lysine 4 trimethylation (H3K4me3) complex, composed of ASH-2, WDR-5 and the histone methyltransferase SET-2, regulates Caenorhabditis elegans lifespan. Here we show that deficiencies in the H3K4me3 chromatin modifiers ASH-2, WDR-5 or SET-2 in the parental generation extend the lifespan of descendants up until the third generation. The transgenerational inheritance of lifespan extension by members of the ASH-2 complex is dependent on the H3K4me3 demethylase RBR-2, and requires the presence of a functioning germline in the descendants.

137,6071,70,"Creating a robust synthetic surface that repels various liquids would have broad technological implications for areas ranging from biomedical devices and fuel transport to architecture but has proved extremely challenging(1). Inspirations from natural non-wetting structures(2-6), particularly the leaves of the lotus, have led to the development of liquid-repellent microtextured surfaces that rely on the formation of a stable air-liquid interface(7-9). Despite over a decade of intense research, these surfaces are, however, still plagued with problems that restrict their practical applications: limited oleophobicity with high contact angle hysteresis(9), failure under pressure(10-12) and upon physical damage(1,7,11), inability to self-heal and high production cost(1,11). To address these challenges, here we report a strategy to create self-healing, slippery liquid-infused porous surface(s) (SLIPS) with exceptional liquid- and ice-repellency, pressure stability and enhanced optical transparency. Our approach-inspired by Nepenthes pitcher plants(13)-is conceptually different from the lotus effect, because we use nano/microstructured substrates to lock in place the infused lubricating fluid. We define the requirements for which the lubricant forms a stable, defect-free and inert 'slippery' interface. This surface outperforms its natural counterparts(2-6) and state-of-the-art synthetic liquid-repellent surfaces(8,9,14-16) in its capability to repel various simple and complex liquids (water, hydrocarbons, crude oil and blood), maintain low contact angle hysteresis (<2.5 degrees), quickly restore liquid-repellency after physical damage (within 0.1-1 s), resist ice adhesion, and function at high pressures (up to about 680 atm). We show that these properties are insensitive to the precise geometry of the underlying substrate, making our approach applicable to various inexpensive, low-surface-energy structured materials (such as porous Teflon membrane). We envision that these slippery surfaces will be useful in fluid handling and transportation, optical sensing, medicine, and as self-cleaning and antifouling materials operating in extreme environments.","Wong, Tak-Sing; Kang, Sung Hoon; Tang, Sindy K.

138,6080,79,"Bacteria and archaea acquire resistance to viruses and plasmids by integrating short fragments of foreign DNA into clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPRs). These repetitive loci maintain a genetic record of all prior encounters with foreign transgressors(1-6). CRISPRs are transcribed and the long primary transcript is processed into a library of short CRISPR-derived RNAs (crRNAs) that contain a unique sequence complementary to a foreign nucleic-acid challenger(7-12). In Escherichia coli, crRNAs are incorporated into a multisubunit surveillance complex called Cascade (CRISPR-associated complex for antiviral defence), which is required for protection against bacteriophages(13,14). Here we use cryo-electron microscopy to determine the subnanometre structures of Cascade before and after binding to a target sequence. These structures reveal a sea-horse-shaped architecture in which the crRNA is displayed along a helical arrangement of protein subunits that protect the crRNA from degradation while maintaining its availability for base pairing. Cascade engages invading nucleic acids through high-affinity base-pairing interactions near the 5' end of the crRNA. Base pairing extends along the crRNA, resulting in a series of short helical segments that trigger a concerted conformational change. This conformational rearrangement may serve as a signal that recruits a trans-acting nuclease (Cas3) for destruction of invading nucleic-acid sequences.","Wiedenheft, Blake; Lander, Gabriel C.; Zhou, Kaihong; Jore, Matthijs M.; Brouns, Stan J.

141,6159,158,"The discovery of deep-sea hydrothermal vents in 1977 revolutionized our understanding of the energy sources that fuel primary productivity on Earth. Hydrothermal vent ecosystems are dominated by animals that live in symbiosis with chemosynthetic bacteria. So far, only two energy sources have been shown to power chemosynthetic symbioses: reduced sulphur compounds and methane. Using metagenome sequencing, single-gene fluorescence in situ hybridization, immunohistochemistry, shipboard incubations and in situ mass spectrometry, we show here that the symbionts of the hydrothermal vent mussel Bathymodiolus from the Mid-Atlantic Ridge use hydrogen to power primary production. In addition, we show that the symbionts of Bathymodiolus mussels from Pacific vents have hupL, the key gene for hydrogen oxidation. Furthermore, the symbionts of other vent animals such as the tubeworm Riftia pachyptila and the shrimp Rimicaris exoculata also have hupL. We propose that the ability to use hydrogen as an energy source is widespread in hydrothermal vent symbioses, particularly at sites where hydrogen is abundant.","Petersen, Jillian M.; Zielinski, Frank U.; Pape, Thomas; Seifert, Richard; Moraru, Cristina; Amann, Rudolf; Hourdez, Stephane; Girguis, Peter R.; Wankel, Scott D.; Barbe, Valerie; Pelletier, Eric; Fink, Dennis; Borowski, Christian; Bach, Wolfgang; Dubilier, Nicole","Petersen, JM; Zielinski, FU; Pape, T; Seifert, R; Moraru, C; Amann, R; Hourdez, S; Girguis, PR; Wankel, SD; Barbe, V; Pelletier, E; Fink, D; Borowski, C; Bach, W; Dubilier, N",176.0,"[Petersen, Jillian M.; Zielinski, Frank U.; Moraru, Cristina; Amann, Rudolf; Fink, Dennis; Borowski, Christian; Dubilier, Nicole] Max Planck Inst Marine Microbiol, D-28359 Bremen, Germany; [Zielinski, Frank U.] UFZ Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, D-04318 Leipzig, Germany; [Pape, Thomas] Univ Bremen, MARUM Ctr Marine Environm Sci, D-28334 Bremen, Germany; [Pape, Thomas; Bach, Wolfgang] Univ Bremen, Dept Geosci, D-28334 Bremen, Germany; [Seifert, Richard] Univ Hamburg, Inst Biogeochem & Marine Chem, D-20146 Hamburg, Germany; [Hourdez, Stephane] CNRS UPMC UMR 7144, Biol Stn, Equipe Genet Adaptat Milieux Extremes, F-29682 Roscoff, France; [Girguis, Peter R.; Wankel, Scott D.] Harvard Univ, Dept Organism & Evolutionary Biol, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Barbe, Valerie; Pelletier, Eric] Commissariat Energie Atom Genoscope, F-91000 Evry, France; [Barbe, Valerie; Pelletier, Eric] CNRS, UMR8030, F-91000 Evry, France; [Barbe, Valerie; Pelletier, Eric] Univ Evry Val dEssone, F-91000 Evry, France",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature10325,Article,1476-4687,ndubilie@mpi-bremen.de,180,"German Science Foundation (DFG) [1144, 60]; DFG Cluster of Excellence ""The Ocean in the Earth System"" at MARUM (Center for Marine Environmental Sciences); Max Planck Society","We thank the chief scientists, and the captains and crews of the research vessels and remotely operated vehicles involved in sampling and analyses at sea.

In particular, transplantation of embryonic-stem-cell-derived dopaminergic neurons has been shown to be efficient in restoring motor symptoms in conditions of dopamine deficiency(3,4). However, the use of pluripotent-derived cells might lead to the development of tumours if not properly controlled(5). Here we identified a minimal set of three transcription factors-Mash1 (also known as Ascl1), Nurr1 (also known as Nr4a2) and Lmx1a-that are able to generate directly functional dopaminergic neurons from mouse and human fibroblasts without reverting to a progenitor cell stage. Induced dopaminergic (iDA) cells release dopamine and show spontaneous electrical activity organized in regular spikes consistent with the pacemaker activity featured by brain dopaminergic neurons. The three factors were able to elicit dopaminergic neuronal conversion in prenatal and adult fibroblasts from healthy donors and Parkinson's disease patients. Direct generation of iDA cells from somatic cells might have significant implications for understanding critical processes for neuronal development, in vitro disease modelling and cell replacement therapies.","Caiazzo, Massimiliano; Dell'Anno, Maria Teresa; Dvoretskova, Elena; Lazarevic, Dejan; Taverna, Stefano; Leo, Damiana; Sotnikova, Tatyana D.; Menegon, Andrea; Roncaglia, Paola; Colciago, Giorgia; Russo, Giovanni; Carninci, Piero; Pezzoli, Gianni; Gainetdinov, Raul R.; Gustincich, Stefano; Dityatev, Alexander; Broccoli, Vania","Caiazzo, M; Dell'Anno, MT; Dvoretskova, E; Lazarevic, D; Taverna, S; Leo, D; Sotnikova, TD; Menegon, A; Roncaglia, P; Colciago, G; Russo, G; Carninci, P; Pezzoli, G; Gainetdinov, RR; Gustincich, S; Dityatev, A; Broccoli, V",224.0,"[Caiazzo, Massimiliano; Dell'Anno, Maria Teresa; Colciago, Giorgia; Broccoli, Vania] Ist Sci San Raffaele, Stem Cells & Neurogenesis Unit, Div Neurosci, I-20132 Milan, Italy; [Dvoretskova, Elena; Taverna, Stefano; Leo, Damiana; Sotnikova, Tatyana D.; Russo, Giovanni; Pezzoli, Gianni; Gainetdinov, Raul R.; Dityatev, Alexander] Ist Italiano Tecnol, Dept Neurosci & Brain Technol, I-16163 Genoa, Italy; [Lazarevic, Dejan] CBM Srl, I-34149 Trieste, Italy; [Lazarevic, Dejan; Roncaglia, Paola; Gustincich, Stefano] Int Sch Adv Studies SISSA, Neurobiol Sect, I-34136 Trieste, Italy; [Menegon, Andrea] Ist Sci San Raffaele, Expt Imaging Ctr, Adv Light & Electron Microscopy Bioimaging Ctr, I-20132 Milan, Italy; [Carninci, Piero] RIKEN Yokohama Inst, Omics Sci Ctr, Tsurumi Ku, Kanagawa 2300045, Japan; [Pezzoli, Gianni] Ist Clin Perfezionamento, Parkinson Inst, I-20126 Milan, Italy; [Gustincich, Stefano] Giovanni Armenise Harvard Fdn Lab, I-34136 Trieste, Italy",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature10284,Article,1476-4687,broccoli.vania@hsr.it,U151,Fondazione Grigioni per il Morbo di Parkinson [FGBRCVNI10310-001-V.B.]; Eranet Neuron; Cariplo Foundation; Ministry of Health; Italian Institute of Technology; Fondazione Telethon,"We are thankful to D.

143,6183,182,"Intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs) express the photopigment melanopsin and regulate a wide array of light-dependent physiological processes(1-11). Genetic ablation of ipRGCs eliminates circadian photoentrainment and severely disrupts the pupillary light reflex (PLR)(12,13). Here we show that ipRGCs consist of distinct subpopulations that differentially express the Brn3b transcription factor, and can be functionally distinguished. Brn3b-negative M1 ipRGCs innervate the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus, whereas Brn3b-positive ipRGCs innervate all other known brain targets, including the olivary pre-tectal nucleus. Consistent with these innervation patterns, selective ablation of Brn3b-positive ipRGCs severely disrupts the PLR, but does not impair circadian photoentrainment. Thus, we find that molecularly distinct subpopulations of M1 ipRGCs, which are morphologically and electrophysiologically similar, innervate different brain regions to execute specific light-induced functions.","Chen, S. -K.; Badea, T.

Here we use single-molecule Forster resonance energy transfer(4,5) to detect and quantify rare misfolding events in tandem immunoglobulin domains from the I band of titin under native conditions. About 5.5 per cent of molecules with identical domains misfold during refolding in vitro and form an unexpectedly stable state with an unfolding half-time of several days. Tandem arrays of immunoglobulin-like domains in humans show significantly lower sequence identity between neighbouring domains than between non-adjacent domains(3). In particular, the sequence identity of neighbouring domains has been found to be preferentially below 40 per cent(3). We observe no misfolding for a tandem of naturally neighbouring domains with low sequence identity (24 per cent), whereas misfolding occurs between domains that are 42 per cent identical. Coarse-grained molecular simulations predict the formation of domain-swapped structures that are in excellent agreement with the observed transfer efficiency of the misfolded species. We infer that the interactions underlying misfolding are very specific and result in a sequence-specific domain-swapping mechanism. Diversifying the sequence between neighbouring domains seems to be a successful evolutionary strategy to avoid misfolding in multidomain proteins.","Borgia, Madeleine B.; Borgia, Alessandro; Best, Robert B.; Steward, Annette; Nettels, Daniel; Wunderlich, Bengt; Schuler, Benjamin; Clarke, Jane","Borgia, MB; Borgia, A; Best, RB; Steward, A; Nettels, D; Wunderlich, B; Schuler, B; Clarke, J",662.0,"[Borgia, Madeleine B.; Best, Robert B.; Steward, Annette; Clarke, Jane] Univ Cambridge, Chem Lab, Cambridge CB2 1EW, England; [Borgia, Madeleine B.; Borgia, Alessandro; Nettels, Daniel; Wunderlich, Bengt; Schuler, Benjamin] Univ Zurich, Inst Biochem, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature10099,Article,,schuler@bioc.uzh.ch; jc162@cam.ac.uk,U142,Wellcome Trust [064417]; Swiss National Science Foundation; Swiss National Center of Competence in Research in Structural Biology; UK Medical Research Council; Marie Curie Intra-European Fellowship; Royal Society,"This work was supported by the Wellcome Trust (grant number, 064417), the Swiss National Science Foundation (to B.

145,6265,264,"Polyhydroxylated steroids are regulators of body shape and size in higher organisms. In metazoans, intracellular receptors recognize these molecules. Plants, however, perceive steroids at membranes, using the membrane-integral receptor kinase BRASSINOSTEROID INSENSITIVE 1 (BRI1). Here we report the structure of the Arabidopsis thaliana BRI1 ligand-binding domain, determined by X-ray diffraction at 2.5 angstrom resolution. We find a superhelix of 25 twisted leucine-rich repeats (LRRs), an architecture that is strikingly different from the assembly of LRRs in animal Toll-like receptors. A 70-amino-acid island domain between LRRs 21 and 22 folds back into the interior of the superhelix to create a surface pocket for binding the plant hormone brassinolide. Known loss- and gain-of-function mutations map closely to the hormone-binding site. We propose that steroid binding to BRI1 generates a docking platform for a co-receptor that is required for receptor activation. Our findings provide insight into the activation mechanism of this highly expanded family of plant receptors that have essential roles in hormone, developmental and innate immunity signalling.","Hothorn, Michael; Belkhadir, Youssef; Dreux, Marlene; Dabi, Tsegaye; Noel, Joseph.

147,6339,338,"The spliceosome is a dynamic macromolecular machine that assembles on pre-messenger RNA substrates and catalyses the excision of non-coding intervening sequences (introns)(1-3). Four of the five major components of the spliceosome, U1, U2, U4 and U5 small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs), contain seven Sm proteins (SmB/B9, SmD1, SmD2, SmD3, SmE, SmF and SmG) in common(4,5). Following export of the U1, U2, U4 and U5 snRNAs to the cytoplasm(6,7), the seven Sm proteins, chaperoned by the survival of motor neurons (SMN) complex, assemble around a single-stranded, U-rich sequence called the Sm site in each small nuclear RNA (snRNA), to form the core domain of the respective snRNP particle(8,9). Core domain formation is a prerequisite for re-import into the nucleus(10), where these snRNPs mature via addition of their particle-specific proteins. Here we present a crystal structure of the U4 snRNP core domain at 3.6 angstrom resolution, detailing how the Sm site heptad (AUUUUUG) binds inside the central hole of the heptameric ring of Sm proteins, interacting one-to-one with SmE-SmG-SmD3-SmB-SmD1-SmD2-SmF. An irregular backbone conformation of the Sm site sequence combined with the asymmetric structure of the heteromeric protein ring allows each base to interact in a distinct manner with four key residues at equivalent positions in the L3 and L5 loops of the Sm fold. A comparison of this structure with the U1 snRNP at 5.5 angstrom resolution(11,12) reveals snRNA-dependent structural changes outside the Sm fold, which may facilitate the binding of particle-specific proteins that are crucial to biogenesis of spliceosomal snRNPs.","Leung, Adelaine K.

149,6407,406,"Although there are substantial differences between the magnetospheres of Jupiter and Saturn, it has been suggested that cryovolcanic activity at Enceladus(1-9) could lead to electrodynamic coupling between Enceladus and Saturn like that which links Jupiter with Io, Europa and Ganymede. Powerful field-aligned electron beams associated with the Io-Jupiter coupling, for example, create an auroral footprint in Jupiter's ionosphere(10,11). Auroral ultraviolet emission associated with Enceladus-Saturn coupling is anticipated to be just a few tenths of a kilorayleigh (ref. 12), about an order of magnitude dimmer than Io's footprint and below the observable threshold, consistent with its non-detection(13). Here we report the detection of magnetic-field-aligned ion and electron beams (offset several moon radii downstream from Enceladus) with sufficient power to stimulate detectable aurora, and the subsequent discovery of Enceladus-associated aurora in a few per cent of the scans of the moon's footprint. The footprint varies in emission magnitude more than can plausibly be explained by changes in magnetospheric parameters-and as such is probably indicative of variable plume activity.","Pryor, Wayne R.; Rymer, Abigail M.; Mitchell, Donald G.; Hill, Thomas W.; Young, David T.; Saur, Joachim; Jones, Geraint H.; Jacobsen, Sven; Cowley, Stan W.

150,6451,450,"CRISPR/Cas systems constitute a widespread class of immunity systems that protect bacteria and archaea against phages and plasmids, and commonly use repeat/spacer-derived short crRNAs to silence foreign nucleic acids in a sequence-specific manner. Although the maturation of crRNAs represents a key event in CRISPR activation, the responsible endoribonucleases (CasE, Cas6, Csy4) are missing in many CRISPR/Cas subtypes. Here, differential RNA sequencing of the human pathogen Streptococcus pyogenes uncovered tracrRNA, a trans-encoded small RNA with 24-nucleotide complementarity to the repeat regions of crRNA precursor transcripts. We show that tracrRNA directs the maturation of crRNAs by the activities of the widely conserved endogenous RNase III and the CRISPR-associated Csn1 protein; all these components are essential to protect S. pyogenes against prophage-derived DNA. Our study reveals a novel pathway of small guide RNA maturation and the first example of a host factor (RNase III) required for bacterial RNA-mediated immunity against invaders.","Deltcheva, Elitza; Chylinski, Krzysztof; Sharma, Cynthia M.; Gonzales, Karine; Chao, Yanjie; Pirzada, Zaid A.; Eckert, Maria R.; Vogel, Joerg; Charpentier, Emmanuelle","Deltcheva, E; Chylinski, K; Sharma, CM; Gonzales, K; Chao, YJ; Pirzada, ZA; Eckert, MR; Vogel, J; Charpentier, E",602.0,"[Deltcheva, Elitza; Chylinski, Krzysztof; Charpentier, Emmanuelle] Umea Univ, Dept Mol Biol, UCMR, Lab Mol Infect Med Sweden MIMS, S-90187 Umea, Sweden; [Deltcheva, Elitza; Chylinski, Krzysztof; Gonzales, Karine; Pirzada, Zaid A.; Eckert, Maria R.; Charpentier, Emmanuelle] Univ Vienna, Max F Perutz Labs, A-1030 Vienna, Austria; [Sharma, Cynthia M.; Chao, Yanjie; Vogel, Joerg] Univ Wurzburg, ZINF Res Ctr Infect Dis, D-97080 Wurzburg, Germany; [Chao, Yanjie; Vogel, Joerg] Univ Wurzburg, RNA Biol Grp, Inst Mol Infect Biol, D-97080 Wurzburg, Germany",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature09886,Article,1476-4687,emmanuelle.charpentier@mims.umu.se,+,"European Community [BACRNAs-018618]; Austrian Science Fund (FWF) [P17238-B09, W1207-B09]; Austrian Agency for Research Promotion (FFG) [812138-SCK/KUG]; Theodor Korner Fonds; Umea University; Swedish Research Council; IMPRS-IDI; German Research Council (DFG) [SPP1258, Vo875/4]; German Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) [01GS0806/JV-BMBF-01, 0315836]","We thank D.

151,6484,483,"'Hyperthermals' are intervals of rapid, pronounced global warming known from six episodes within the Palaeocene and Eocene epochs (similar to 65-34 million years (Myr) ago)(1-13). The most extreme hyperthermal was the 170 thousand year (kyr) interval(2) of 5-7 degrees C global warming(3) during the Palaeocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM, 56 Myr ago). The PETM is widely attributed to massive release of greenhouse gases from buried sedimentary carbon reservoirs(1,3,6,11,14-17), and other, comparatively modest, hyperthermals have also been linked to the release of sedimentary carbon(3,6,11,16,17). Here we show, using new 2.4-Myr-long Eocene deep ocean records, that the comparatively modest hyperthermals are much more numerous than previously documented, paced by the eccentricity of Earth's orbit and have shorter durations (40 kyr) and more rapid recovery phases than the PETM. These findings point to the operation of fundamentally different forcing and feedback mechanisms than for the PETM, involving redistribution of carbon among Earth's readily exchangeable surface reservoirs rather than carbon exhumation from, and subsequent burial back into, the sedimentary reservoir. Specifically, we interpret our records to indicate repeated, large-scale releases of dissolved organic carbon (at least 1,600 giga-tonnes) from the ocean by ventilation (strengthened oxidation) of the ocean interior. The rapid recovery of the carbon cycle following each Eocene hyperthermal strongly suggests that carbon was re-sequestered by the ocean, rather than the much slower process of silicate rock weathering proposed for the PETM1,3. Our findings suggest that these pronounced climate warming events were driven not by repeated releases of carbon from buried sedimentary sources(3,6,11,16,17), but, rather, by patterns of surficial carbon redistribution familiar from younger intervals of Earth history.","Sexton, Philip F.; Norris, Richard D.; Wilson, Paul A.; Paelike, Heiko; Westerhold, Thomas; Roehl, Ursula; Bolton, Clara T.; Gibbs, Samantha","Sexton, PF; Norris, RD; Wilson, PA; Palike, H; Westerhold, T; Rohl, U; Bolton, CT; Gibbs, S",349.0,"[Sexton, Philip F.; Norris, Richard D.] Univ Calif San Diego, Scripps Inst Oceanog, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Sexton, Philip F.; Wilson, Paul A.; Paelike, Heiko; Bolton, Clara T.; Gibbs, Samantha] Univ Southampton, Natl Oceanog Ctr Southampton, Southampton SO14 3ZH, Hants, England; [Westerhold, Thomas; Roehl, Ursula] Univ Bremen, MARUM Ctr Marine Environm Sci, D-28359 Bremen, Germany",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature09826,Article,1476-4687,P.F.Sexton@open.ac.uk,+,US NSF and; European Commission; Leverhulme Trust; Natural Environment Research Council UK; Philip Leverhulme Prize; DFG-Leibniz Center for Surface Process and Climate Studies at the University of Potsdam; DFG,"We thank M.
