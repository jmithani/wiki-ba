0,"Major ice sheets were permanently established on Antarctica approximately 34 million years ago(1-3), close to the Eocene/Oligocene boundary, at the same time as a permanent deepening of the calcite compensation depth in the world's oceans(4). Until recently, it was thought that Northern Hemisphere glaciation began much later, between 11 and 5 million years ago(1-3,5). This view has been challenged, however, by records of ice rafting at high northern latitudes during the Eocene epoch(6,7) and by estimates of global ice volume that exceed the storage capacity of Antarctica(8) at the same time as a temporary deepening of the calcite compensation depth 41.6 million years ago(9). Here we test the hypothesis that large ice sheets were present in both hemispheres 41.6 million years ago using marine sediment records of oxygen and carbon isotope values and of calcium carbonate content from the equatorial Atlantic Ocean. These records allow, at most, an ice budget that can easily be accommodated on Antarctica, indicating that large ice sheets were not present in the Northern Hemisphere. The records also reveal a brief interval shortly before the temporary deepening of the calcite compensation depth during which the calcite compensation depth shoaled, ocean temperatures increased and carbon isotope values decreased in the equatorial Atlantic. The nature of these changes around 41.6 million years ago implies common links, in terms of carbon cycling, with events at the Eocene/Oligocene boundary(4) and with the 'hyperthermals' of the Early Eocene climate optimum(3,10,11). Our findings help to resolve the apparent discrepancy between the geological records of Northern Hemisphere glaciation(6-8) and model results(12,13) that indicate that the threshold for continental glaciation was crossed earlier in the Southern Hemisphere than in the Northern Hemisphere.","Edgar, Kirsty M.; Wilson, Paul A.; Sexton, Philip F.; Suganuma, Yusuke","Edgar, KM; Wilson, PA; Sexton, PF; Suganuma, Y",908,"Natl Oceanog Ctr, Sch Ocean & Earth Sci, Southampton SO14 3ZH, Hants, England; Univ Tokyo, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo 1130033, Japan",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature06053,Article,,paw1@noc.soton.ac.uk,911,,,202OM,,,ATMOSPHERIC CARBON-DIOXIDE; ICE-SHEET EXPANSION; ANTARCTIC GLACIATION; OLIGOCENE; OCEAN; PALEOCENE; GREENLAND; MAXIMUM; RECORDS,7156,NATURE,Nature,English,30,No,"suganuma, yusuke/0000-0003-3516-1317; Edgar, Kirsty/0000-0001-7587-9951","MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",23-Aug,4,LONDON,17713530.0,J,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2007,"Sexton, Philip/B-2493-2010","Wilson, PA (reprint author), Natl Oceanog Ctr, Sch Ocean & Earth Sci, European Way, Southampton SO14 3ZH, Hants, England.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,0028-0836,NATURE,51,No extreme bipolar glaciation during the main Eocene calcite compensation shift,0,18,WOS:000248912900042,452,448,Multidisciplinary Sciences,52,yusuke,suganuma,563,28,male,1,1,53708210,14608977,2014 in Antarctica,0,0,2014 in Antarctica,1.0,1,"[0, 1474]",Jaf7rrYAAAAJ
1,"More than half of mammalian genes generate multiple messenger RNA isoforms that differ in their 3' untranslated regions (3' UTRs) and therefore in regulatory sequences(1), often associated with cell proliferation and cancer(2,3); however, the mechanisms coordinating alternative 3'-UTR processing for specific mRNA populations remain poorly defined. Here we report that the cytoplasmic-polyadenylation element binding protein 1 (CPEB1), an RNA-binding protein that regulates mRNA translation(4), also controls alternative 3'-UTR processing. CPEB1 shuttles to the nudeus(5,6), where it co-localizes with splicing factors and mediates shortening of hundreds of mRNA 3' UTRs, thereby modulating their translation efficiency in the cytoplasm. CPEB1-mediated 3'-UTR shortening correlates with cell proliferation and tumorigenesis. CPEB1 binding to pre-mRNAs not only directs the use of alternative polyadenylation sites, but also changes alternative splicing by preventing U2AF65 recruitment. Our results reveal a novel function of CPEB1 in mediating alternative 3'-UTR processing, which is coordinated with regulation of mRNA translation, through its dual nuclear and cytoplasmic functions.","Bava, Felice-Alessio; Eliscovich, Carolina; Ferreira, Pedro G.; Minana, Belen; Ben-Dov, Claudia; Guigo, Roderic; Valcarcel, Juan; Mendez, Raul","Bava, FA; Eliscovich, C; Ferreira, PG; Minana, B; Ben-Dov, C; Guigo, R; Valcarcel, J; Mendez, R",121,"[Bava, Felice-Alessio; Mendez, Raul] Inst Res Biomed IRB Barcelona, Barcelona 08028, Spain; [Eliscovich, Carolina; Ferreira, Pedro G.; Minana, Belen; Ben-Dov, Claudia; Guigo, Roderic; Valcarcel, Juan] UPF, Ctr Genom Regulat CRG, Barcelona 08003, Spain; [Valcarcel, Juan; Mendez, Raul] Passeig Lluis Co 23, ICREA, Barcelona 08010, Spain",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature11901,Article,,raul.mendez@irbbarcelona.org,125,"Consolider; MICINN; Generalitat de Catalunya; RNAREG; AICR; EURASNET; Fundacion Marcelino Botin; National Institutes of Health; Instituto de Salud Carlos III; ""la Caixa"" predoctoral fellowship; FCT-Portugal; Spanish MICINN; ICREA","We thank A.

2,"Classical sexual selection theory(1-4) provides a well-supported conceptual framework for understanding the evolution and signalling function of male ornaments. It predicts that males obtain greater fitness benefits than females through multiple mating because sperm are cheaper to produce than eggs. Sexual selection should therefore lead to the evolution of male-biased secondary sexual characters. However, females of many species are also highly ornamented(5-7). The view that this is due to a correlated genetic response to selection on males(1,8) was widely accepted as an explanation for female ornamentation for over 100 years(5) and current theoretical(9,10) and empirical(11-13) evidence suggests that genetic constraints can limit sex-specific trait evolution. Alternatively, female ornamentation can be the outcome of direct selection for signalling needs(7,14). Since few studies have explored interspecific patterns of both male and female elaboration, our understanding of the evolution of animal ornamentation remains incomplete, especially over broad taxonomic scales. Here we use a new method to quantify plumage colour of all similar to 6,000 species of passerine birds to determine the main evolutionary drivers of ornamental colouration in both sexes. We found that conspecific male and female colour elaboration are strongly correlated, suggesting that evolutionary changes in one sex are constrained by changes in the other sex. Both sexes are more ornamented in larger species and in species living in tropical environments. Ornamentation in females (but not males) is increased in cooperative breeders-species in which female-female competition for reproductive opportunities and other resources related to breeding may be high(6). Finally, strong sexual selection on males has antagonistic effects, causing an increase in male colouration but a considerably more pronounced reduction in female ornamentation. Our results indicate that although there may be genetic constraints to sexually independent colour evolution, both female and male ornamentation are strongly and often differentially related to morphological, social and life-history variables.","Dale, James; Dey, Cody J.; Delhey, Kaspar; Kempenaers, Bart; Valcu, Mihai","Dale, J; Dey, CJ; Delhey, K; Kempenaers, B; Valcu, M",367,"[Dale, James] Massey Univ, Inst Nat & Math Sci, Auckland 0745, New Zealand; [Dey, Cody J.] McMaster Univ, Dept Biol, Hamilton, ON L8S 4K1, Canada; [Delhey, Kaspar] Monash Univ, Sch Biol Sci, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia; [Delhey, Kaspar] Max Planck Inst Ornithol, D-78315 Radolfzell am Bodensee, Germany; [Kempenaers, Bart; Valcu, Mihai] Max Planck Inst Ornithol, Dept Behav Ecol & Evolutionary Genet, D-82319 Seewiesen, Germany",,,11/19/17,,10.1038/nature15509,Article,1476-4687,j.dale@massey.ac.nz,+,Massey University; Australian and Pacific Science Foundation [APSF 10/8]; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) Canadian Graduate Scholarship; Australian Research Council [DE120102323]; Max Planck Society,"We thank the many ornithologists and scientists who have published their data or contributed data to public databases, allowing us to conduct this study.

3,"Integrase is an essential retroviral enzyme that binds both termini of linear viral DNA and inserts them into a host cell chromosome. The structure of full-length retroviral integrase, either separately or in complex with DNA, has been lacking. Furthermore, although clinically useful inhibitors of HIV integrase have been developed, their mechanism of action remains speculative. Here we present a crystal structure of full-length integrase from the prototype foamy virus in complex with its cognate DNA. The structure shows the organization of the retroviral intasome comprising an integrase tetramer tightly associated with a pair of viral DNA ends. All three canonical integrase structural domains are involved in extensive protein-DNA and protein-protein interactions. The binding of strand-transfer inhibitors displaces the reactive viral DNA end from the active site, disarming the viral nucleoprotein complex. Our findings define the structural basis of retroviral DNA integration, and will allow modelling of the HIV-1 intasome to aid in the development of antiretroviral drugs.","Hare, Stephen; Gupta, Saumya Shree; Valkov, Eugene; Engelman, Alan; Cherepanov, Peter","Hare, S; Gupta, SS; Valkov, E; Engelman, A; Cherepanov, P",232,"[Hare, Stephen; Gupta, Saumya Shree; Valkov, Eugene; Cherepanov, Peter] Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Div Med, London W2 1PG, England; [Engelman, Alan] Dana Farber Canc Inst, Dept Canc Immunol & AIDS, Boston, MA 02115 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature08784,Article,,p.cherepanov@imperial.ac.uk,U108,UK Medical Research Council; US National Institutes of Health,"We thank F.

4,"Greek speakers say ""ovpa"", Germans ""schwanz'' and the French ""queue'' to describe what English speakers call a 'tail', but all of these languages use a related form of 'two' to describe the number after one. Among more than 100 Indo-European languages and dialects, the words for some meanings (such as 'tail') evolve rapidly, being expressed across languages by dozens of unrelated words, while others evolve much more slowly-such as the number 'two', for which all Indo-European language speakers use the same related word-form(1). No general linguistic mechanism has been advanced to explain this striking variation in rates of lexical replacement among meanings. Here we use four large and divergent language corpora (English(2), Spanish(3), Russian(4) and Greek(5)) and a comparative database of 200 fundamental vocabulary meanings in 87 Indo-European languages(6) to show that the frequency with which these words are used in modern language predicts their rate of replacement over thousands of years of Indo-European language evolution. Across all 200 meanings, frequently used words evolve at slower rates and infrequently used words evolve more rapidly. This relationship holds separately and identically across parts of speech for each of the four language corpora, and accounts for approximately 50% of the variation in historical rates of lexical replacement. We propose that the frequency with which specific words are used in everyday language exerts a general and law-like influence on their rates of evolution. Our findings are consistent with social models of word change that emphasize the role of selection, and suggest that owing to the ways that humans use language, some words will evolve slowly and others rapidly across all languages.","Pagel, Mark; Atkinson, Quentin D.; Meade, Andrew","Pagel, M; Atkinson, QD; Meade, A",717,"Univ Reading, Sch Biol Sci, Reading RG6 6AS, Berks, England; Santa Fe Inst, Santa Fe, NM 87501 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature06176,Article,,m.pagel@reading.ac.uk,U7,,,218VV,,,DIVERGENCE,7163,NATURE,Nature,English,35,No,"Atkinson, Quentin/0000-0002-8499-7535","MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",11-Oct,5,LONDON,17928860.0,J,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2007,,"Pagel, M (reprint author), Univ Reading, Sch Biol Sci, Reading RG6 6AS, Berks, England.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,0028-0836,NATURE,158,Frequency of word-use predicts rates of lexical evolution throughout Indo-European history,0,28,WOS:000250045000043,352,449,Multidisciplinary Sciences,161,andrew,meade,139,5168,male,0,0,na,na,na,0,0,na,1.0,1,"[0, 1474]",7LWApVAAAAAJ
5,"Eukaryotic cells express a wide variety of endogenous small regulatory RNAs that regulate heterochromatin formation, developmental timing, defence against parasitic nucleic acids and genome rearrangement. Many small regulatory RNAs are thought to function in nuclei(1,2). For instance, in plants and fungi, short interfering RNA (siRNAs) associate with nascent transcripts and direct chromatin and/or DNA modifications(1,2). To understand further the biological roles of small regulatory RNAs, we conducted a genetic screen to identify factors required for RNA interference (RNAi) in Caenorhabditis elegans nuclei(3). Here we show that the gene nuclear RNAi defective-2 (nrde-2) encodes an evolutionarily conserved protein that is required for siRNA-mediated silencing in nuclei. NRDE-2 associates with the Argonaute protein NRDE-3 within nuclei and is recruited by NRDE-3/siRNA complexes to nascent transcripts that have been targeted by RNAi. We find that nuclear-localized siRNAs direct an NRDE-2-dependent silencing of pre-messenger RNAs (pre-mRNAs) 3' to sites of RNAi, an NRDE-2-dependent accumulation of RNA polymerase (RNAP) II at genomic loci targeted by RNAi, and NRDE-2-dependent decreases in RNAP II occupancy and RNAP II transcriptional activity 39 to sites of RNAi. These results define NRDE-2 as a component of the nuclear RNAi machinery and demonstrate that metazoan siRNAs can silence nuclear-localized RNAs co-transcriptionally. In addition, these results establish a novel mode of RNAP II regulation: siRNA-directed recruitment of NRDE factors that inhibit RNAP II during the elongation phase of transcription.","Guang, Shouhong; Bochner, Aaron F.; Burkhart, Kirk B.; Burton, Nick; Pavelec, Derek M.; Kennedy, Scott","Guang, SH; Bochner, AF; Burkhart, KB; Burton, N; Pavelec, DM; Kennedy, S",1097,"[Guang, Shouhong; Bochner, Aaron F.; Burkhart, Kirk B.; Burton, Nick; Kennedy, Scott] Univ Wisconsin, Genet Lab, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Pavelec, Derek M.; Kennedy, Scott] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Pharmacol, Madison, WI 53706 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature09095,Article,,sgkennedy@wisc.edu,U165,Pew and Shaw scholars programmes; National Institutes of Health; American Heart Association,"We thank P.

6,"The formation of relativistic jets by an accreting compact object is one of the fundamental mysteries of astrophysics. Although the theory is poorly understood, observations of relativistic jets from systems known as microquasars (compact binary stars)(1,2) have led to a well established phenomenology(3,4). Relativistic jets are not expected to be produced by sources with soft or supersoft X-ray spectra, although two such systems are known to produce relatively low-velocity bipolar outflows(5,6). Here we report the optical spectra of an ultraluminous supersoft X-ray source (ULS7,8) in the nearby galaxy M81 (M81 ULS-1; refs 9, 10). Unexpectedly, the spectra show blueshifted, broad H alpha emission lines, characteristic of baryonic jets with relativistic speeds. These time-variable emission lines have projected velocities of about 17 per cent of the speed of light, and seem to be similar to those from the prototype microquasar SS 433 (refs 11, 12). Such relativistic jets are not expected to be launched from white dwarfs(13), and an origin from a black hole or a neutron star is hard to reconcile with the persistence of M81 ULS-1's soft X-rays(10). Thus the unexpected presence of relativistic jets in a ULS challenges canonical theories of jet formation(3,4), but might be explained by a long-speculated, supercritically accreting black hole with optically thick outflows(14-20).","Liu, Ji-Feng; Bai, Yu; Wang, Song; Justham, Stephen; Lu, You-Jun; Gu, Wei-Min; Liu, Qing-Zhong; Di Stefano, Rosanne; Guo, Jin-Cheng; Cabrera-Lavers, Antonio; Alvarez, Pedro; Cao, Yi; Kulkarni, Shri","Liu, JF; Bai, Y; Wang, S; Justham, S; Lu, YJ; Gu, WM; Liu, QZ; Di Stefano, R; Guo, JC; Cabrera-Lavers, A; Alvarez, P; Cao, Y; Kulkarni, S",108,"[Liu, Ji-Feng; Bai, Yu; Wang, Song; Justham, Stephen; Lu, You-Jun; Guo, Jin-Cheng] Chinese Acad Sci, Natl Astron Observ, Key Lab Opt Astron, Beijing 100012, Peoples R China; [Liu, Ji-Feng; Justham, Stephen; Lu, You-Jun] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Coll Astron & Space Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China; [Gu, Wei-Min] Xiamen Univ, Dept Astron, Xiamen 361005, Fujian Province, Peoples R China; [Liu, Qing-Zhong] Chinese Acad Sci, Purple Mt Observ, Key Lab Dark Matter & Space Astron, Nanjing 210008, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Di Stefano, Rosanne] Harvard Smithsonian Ctr Astrophys, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Cabrera-Lavers, Antonio; Alvarez, Pedro] Inst Astrofis Canarias, E-38200 San Cristobal la Laguna, Tenerife, Spain; [Cabrera-Lavers, Antonio; Alvarez, Pedro] Univ La Laguna, Dept Astrofis, E-38205 San Cristobal la Laguna, Tenerife, Spain; [Cao, Yi; Kulkarni, Shri] CALTECH, Dept Astron, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA",,,11/19/17,,10.1038/nature15751,Article,1476-4687,jfliu@nao.cas.cn,+,Chinese Academy of Sciences [XDB09000000]; 973 Program [2014CB845705]; National Science Foundation of China [NSFC-11333004/11425313]; W.M.

7,"Tropical peatlands contain one of the largest pools of terrestrial organic carbon, amounting to about 89,000 teragrams(1) (1 Tg is a billion kilograms). Approximately 65 per cent of this carbon store is in Indonesia, where extensive anthropogenic degradation in the form of deforestation, drainage and fire are converting it into a globally significant source of atmospheric carbon dioxide(1-3). Here we quantify the annual export of fluvial organic carbon from both intact peat swamp forest and peat swamp forest subject to past anthropogenic disturbance. We find that the total fluvial organic carbon flux from disturbed peat swamp forest is about 50 per cent larger than that from intact peat swamp forest. By carbon-14 dating of dissolved organic carbon (which makes up over 91 per cent of total organic carbon), we find that leaching of dissolved organic carbon from intact peat swamp forest is derived mainly from recent primary production (plant growth). In contrast, dissolved organic carbon from disturbed peat swamp forest consists mostly of much older (centuries to millennia) carbon from deep within the peat column. When we include the fluvial carbon loss term, which is often ignored, in the peatland carbon budget, we find that it increases the estimate of total carbon lost from the disturbed peatlands in our study by 22 per cent. We further estimate that since 1990 peatland disturbance has resulted in a 32 per cent increase in fluvial organic carbon flux from southeast Asia-an increase that is more than half of the entire annual fluvial organic carbon flux from all European peatlands. Our findings emphasize the need to quantify fluvial carbon losses in order to improve estimates of the impact of deforestation and drainage on tropical peatland carbon balances.","Moore, Sam; Evans, Chris D.; Page, Susan E.; Garnett, Mark H.; Jones, Tim G.; Freeman, Chris; Hooijer, Aljosja; Wiltshire, Andrew J.; Limin, Suwido H.; Gauci, Vincent","Moore, S; Evans, CD; Page, SE; Garnett, MH; Jones, TG; Freeman, C; Hooijer, A; Wiltshire, AJ; Limin, SH; Gauci, V",660,"[Moore, Sam; Gauci, Vincent] Open Univ, Dept Environm Earth & Ecosyst, CEPSAR, Milton Keynes MK7 6AA, Bucks, England; [Evans, Chris D.] Environm Ctr Wales, Ctr Ecol & Hydrol, Bangor LL57 2UW, Gwynedd, Wales; [Page, Susan E.] Univ Leicester, Dept Geog, Leicester LE1 7RH, Leics, England; [Garnett, Mark H.] Nat Environm Res Council Radiocarbon Facil, E Kilbride G75 0QF, Lanark, Scotland; [Jones, Tim G.; Freeman, Chris] Bangor Univ, Sch Biol Sci, Bangor LL57 2UW, Gwynedd, Wales; [Hooijer, Aljosja] Deltares, NL-2600 MH Delft, Netherlands; [Wiltshire, Andrew J.] Met Off Hadley Ctr, Exeter EX1 3PB, Devon, England; [Limin, Suwido H.] Univ Palangka Raya, CIMTROP, Palangka Raya 73112, Central Kaliman, Indonesia",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature11818,Article,1476-4687,v.gauci@open.ac.uk,+,"NERC [NE/F008813/1]; Natural Environment Research Council (NERC); Open University (CEPSAR) via the NERC Radiocarbon Facility (Environment) [1323.1008, 15.91]; DECC/Defra Met Office Hadley Centre Programme [GA01101]; Royal Society; British Council","S.M. was supported by a NERC PhD studentship (NE/F008813/1).

8,"Ancient DNA makes it possible to observe natural selection directly by analysing samples from populations before, during and after adaptation events. Here we report a genome-wide scan for selection using ancient DNA, capitalizing on the largest ancient DNA data set yet assembled: 230 West Eurasians who lived between 6500 and 300 BC, including 163 with newly reported data. The new samples include, to our knowledge, the first genome-wide ancient DNA from Anatolian Neolithic farmers, whose genetic material we obtained by extracting from petrous bones, and who we show were members of the population that was the source of Europe's first farmers. We also report a transect of the steppe region in Samara between 5600 and 300 BC, which allows us to identify admixture into the steppe from at least two external sources. We detect selection at loci associated with diet, pigmentation and immunity, and two independent episodes of selection on height.","Mathieson, Iain; Lazaridis, Iosif; Rohland, Nadin; Mallick, Swapan;

9,"The United States is now experiencing the most rapid expansion in oil and gas production in four decades, owing in large part to implementation of new extraction technologies such as horizontal drilling combined with hydraulic fracturing. The environmental impacts of this development, from its effect on water quality(1) to the influence of increased methane leakage on climate(2), have been a matter of intense debate. Air quality impacts are associated with emissions of nitrogen oxides(3,4) (NOx = NO + NO2) and volatile organic compounds(5-7) (VOCs), whose photochemistry leads to production of ozone, a secondary pollutant with negative health effects(8). Recent observations in oil-and gas-producing basins in the western United States have identified ozone mixing ratios well in excess of present air quality standards, but only during winter(9-13). Understanding winter ozone production in these regions is scientifically challenging. It occurs during cold periods of snow cover when meteorological inversions concentrate air pollutants from oil and gas activities, but when solar irradiance and absolute humidity, which are both required to initiate conventional photochemistry essential for ozone production, are at a minimum. Here, using data from a remote location in the oil and gas basin of northeastern Utah and a box model, we provide a quantitative assessment of the photochemistry that leads to these extreme winter ozone pollution events, and identify key factors that control ozone production in this unique environment. We find that ozone production occurs at lower NOx and much larger VOC concentrations than does its summertime urban counterpart, leading to carbonyl (oxygenated VOCs with a C=O moiety) photolysis as a dominant oxidant source. Extreme VOC concentrations optimize the ozone production efficiency of NOx. There is considerable potential for global growth in oil and gas extraction from shale. This analysis could help inform strategies to monitor and mitigate air quality impacts and provide broader insight into the response of winter ozone to primary pollutants.","Edwards, Peter M.; Brown, Steven S.; Roberts, James M.; Ahmadov, Ravan; Banta, Robert M.; deGouw, Joost A.; Dube, William P.; Field, Robert A.; Flynn, James H.; Gilman, Jessica B.; Graus, Martin; Helmig, Detlev; Koss, Abigail; Langford, Andrew O.; Lefer, Barry L.; Lerner, Brian M.; Li, Rui; Li, Shao-Meng; McKeen, Stuart A.; Murphy, Shane M.; Parrish, David D.; Senff, Christoph J.; Soltis, Jeffrey; Stutz, Jochen; Sweeney, Colm; Thompson, Chelsea R.; Trainer, Michael K.; Tsai, Catalina; Veres, Patrick R.; Washenfelder, Rebecca A.; Warneke, Carsten; Wild, Robert J.; Young, Cora J.; Yuan, Bin; Zamora, Robert","Edwards, PM; Brown, SS; Roberts, JM; Ahmadov, R; Banta, RM; deGouw, JA; Dube, WP; Field, RA; Flynn, JH; Gilman, JB; Graus, M; Helmig, D; Koss, A; Langford, AO; Lefer, BL; Lerner, BM; Li, R; Li, SM; McKeen, SA; Murphy, SM; Parrish, DD; Senff, CJ; Soltis, J; Stutz, J; Sweeney, C; Thompson, CR; Trainer, MK; Tsai, C; Veres, PR; Washenfelder, RA; Warneke, C; Wild, RJ; Young, CJ; Yuan, B; Zamora, R",351,"[Edwards, Peter M.; Brown, Steven S.; Roberts, James M.; Ahmadov, Ravan; Banta, Robert M.; deGouw, Joost A.; Dube, William P.; Gilman, Jessica B.; Graus, Martin; Koss, Abigail; Langford, Andrew O.; Lerner, Brian M.; Li, Rui; McKeen, Stuart A.; Parrish, David D.; Senff, Christoph J.; Sweeney, Colm; Trainer, Michael K.; Veres, Patrick R.; Washenfelder, Rebecca A.; Warneke, Carsten; Wild, Robert J.; Young, Cora J.; Yuan, Bin; Zamora, Robert] NOAA, Earth Syst Res Lab, Boulder, CO 80305 USA; [Edwards, Peter M.; Ahmadov, Ravan; deGouw, Joost A.; Dube, William P.; Gilman, Jessica B.; Graus, Martin; Koss, Abigail; Lerner, Brian M.; Li, Rui; McKeen, Stuart A.; Senff, Christoph J.; Sweeney, Colm; Veres, Patrick R.; Washenfelder, Rebecca A.; Warneke, Carsten; Wild, Robert J.; Yuan, Bin] Univ Colorado, Cooperat Inst Res Environm Sci, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Field, Robert A.; Murphy, Shane M.; Soltis, Jeffrey] Univ Wyoming, Dept Atmospher Sci, Larmie, WY 82070 USA; [Flynn, James H.; Lefer, Barry L.] Univ Houston, Dept Earth & Atmospher Sci, Houston, TX 77204 USA; [Helmig, Detlev; Thompson, Chelsea R.] Univ Colorado, Inst Arctic & Alpine Res, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Li, Shao-Meng] Environm Canada, Air Qual Res Div, Toronto, ON M3H 5T4, Canada; [Stutz, Jochen; Tsai, Catalina] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Ocean & Atmospher Sci, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature13767,Article,1476-4687,steven.s.brown@noaa.gov,+,"Uintah Impact Mitigation Special Service District (UIMSSD); Bureau of Land Management (BLM); Environmental Protection Agency (EPA); Utah State University; Western Energy Alliance; NOAA's Atmospheric Chemistry, Climate and Carbon Cycle programme; Questar Energy Products; National Science Foundation [1212666, 1215926]","The Uintah Basin Winter Ozone Studies were a joint project led and coordinated by the Utah Department of Environmental Quality (UDEQ) and supported by the Uintah Impact Mitigation Special Service District (UIMSSD), the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and Utah State University.

10,"Haemodynamic signals underlying functional brain imaging ( for example, functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI)) are assumed to reflect metabolic demand generated by local neuronal activity, with equal increases in haemodynamic signal implying equal increases in the underlying neuronal activity(1-6). Few studies have compared neuronal and haemodynamic signals in alert animals(7,8) to test for this assumed correspondence. Here we present evidence that brings this assumption into question. Using a dual-wavelength optical imaging technique(9) that independently measures cerebral blood volume and oxygenation, continuously, in alert behaving monkeys, we find two distinct components to the haemodynamic signal in the alert animals' primary visual cortex (V1). One component is reliably predictable from neuronal responses generated by visual input. The other component - of almost comparable strength - is a hither to unknown signal that entrains to task structure independently of visual input or of standard neural predictors of haemodynamics. This latter component shows predictive timing, with increases of cerebral blood volume in anticipation of trial onsets even in darkness. This trial- locked haemodynamic signal could be due to an accompanying V1 arterial pumping mechanism, closely matched in time, with peaks of arterial dilation entrained to predicted trial onsets. These findings ( tested in two animals) challenge the current understanding of the link between brain haemodynamics and local neuronal activity. They also suggest the existence of a novel preparatory mechanism in the brain that brings additional arterial blood to cortex in anticipation of expected tasks.","Sirotin, Yevgeniy B.; Das, Aniruddha","Sirotin, YB; Das, A",475,"[Sirotin, Yevgeniy B.; Das, Aniruddha] Columbia Univ, Dept Neurosci, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Das, Aniruddha] Columbia Univ, Dept Psychiat, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Das, Aniruddha] Columbia Univ, WM Keck Ctr Brain Plastic & Cognit, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Das, Aniruddha] Columbia Univ, Mahoney Ctr Brain & Behav, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Das, Aniruddha] Columbia Univ, Dept Biomed Engn, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Das, Aniruddha] New York State Psychiat Inst & Hosp, Unit 87, New York, NY 10032 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature07664,Article,,ad2069@columbia.edu,U6,Keck foundation; National Institutes of Health; Klingenstein Foundation; Gatsby Initiative in Brain Circuitry; Dana Foundation; National Research Service Award,"We thank: K.

11,"Endogenous retroviruses (ERVs), retrovirus-like elements with long terminal repeats, are widely dispersed in the euchromatic compartment in mammalian cells, comprising similar to 10% of the mouse genome(1). These parasitic elements are responsible for >10% of spontaneous mutations(2). Whereas DNA methylation has an important role in proviral silencing in somatic and germ-lineage cells(3-5), an additional DNA-methylation-independent pathway also functions in embryonal carcinoma and embryonic stem (ES) cells to inhibit transcription of the exogenous gammaretrovirus murine leukaemia virus (MLV)(6-8). Notably, a recent genome-wide study revealed that ERVs are also marked by histone H3 lysine 9 trimethylation (H3K9me3) and H4K20me3 in ES cells but not in mouse embryonic fibroblasts(9). However, the role that these marks have in proviral silencing remains unexplored. Here we show that the H3K9 methyltransferase ESET (also called SETDB1 or KMT1E) and the Kruppel-associated box (KRAB)associated protein 1 (KAP1, also called TRIM28)(10,11) are required for H3K9me3 and silencing of endogenous and introduced retroviruses specifically in mouse ES cells. Furthermore, whereas ESET enzymatic activity is crucial for HP1 binding and efficient proviral silencing, the H4K20 methyltransferases Suv420h1 and Suv420h2 are dispensable for silencing. Notably, in DNA methyltransferase triple knockout (Dnmt1(-/-) Dnmt3a(-/-) Dnmt3b(-/-)) mouse ES cells, ESET and KAP1 binding and ESET-mediated H3K9me3 are maintained and ERVs are minimally derepressed. We propose that a DNA-methylation-independent pathway involving KAP1 and ESET/ESET-mediated H3K9me3 is required for proviral silencing during the period early in embryogenesis when DNA methylation is dynamically reprogrammed.","Matsui, Toshiyuki; Leung, Danny; Miyashita, Hiroki; Maksakova, Irina A.; Miyachi, Hitoshi; Kimura, Hiroshi; Tachibana, Makoto; Lorincz, Matthew C.; Shinkai, Yoichi","Matsui, T; Leung, D; Miyashita, H; Maksakova, IA; Miyachi, H; Kimura, H; Tachibana, M; Lorincz, MC; Shinkai, Y",927,"[Matsui, Toshiyuki; Miyashita, Hiroki; Miyachi, Hitoshi; Tachibana, Makoto; Shinkai, Yoichi] Kyoto Univ, Inst Virus Res, Expt Res Ctr Infect Dis, Sakyo Ku, Kyoto 6068507, Japan; [Matsui, Toshiyuki; Miyashita, Hiroki; Tachibana, Makoto; Shinkai, Yoichi] Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Biostudies, Sakyo Ku, Kyoto 6068507, Japan; [Leung, Danny; Maksakova, Irina A.; Lorincz, Matthew C.] Univ British Columbia, Dept Med Genet, Inst Life Sci, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z3, Canada; [Kimura, Hiroshi] Osaka Univ, Grad Sch Frontier Biosci, Suita, Osaka 5650871, Japan",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature08858,Article,,mlorincz@interchange.ubc.ca; yshinkai@virus.kyoto-u.ac.jp,U149,"Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT) of Japan; CIHR [77805, 92090]","We thank M.

12,"In most eukaryotes, the progressive loss of chromosome-terminal DNA sequences is counteracted by the enzyme telomerase, a reverse transcriptase that uses part of an RNA subunit as template to synthesize telomeric repeats. Many cancer cells express high telomerase activity, and mutations in telomerase subunits are associated with degenerative syndromes including dyskeratosis congenita and aplastic anaemia. The therapeutic value of altering telomerase activity thus provides ample impetus to study the biogenesis and regulation of this enzyme in human cells and model systems. We have previously identified a precursor of the fission yeast telomerase RNA subunit (TER1)(1) and demonstrated that the mature 3'-end is generated by the spliceosome in a single cleavage reaction akin to the first step of splicing(2). Directly upstream and partly overlapping with the spliceosomal cleavage site is a putative binding site for Sm proteins. Sm and like-Sm (LSm) proteins belong to an ancient family of RNA-binding proteins represented in all three domains of life(3). Members of this family form ring complexes on specific sets of target RNAs and have critical roles in their biogenesis, function and turnover. Here we demonstrate that the canonical Sm ring and the Lsm2-8 complex sequentially associate with fission yeast TER1. The Sm ring binds to the TER1 precursor, stimulates spliceosomal cleavage and promotes the hypermethylation of the 5'-cap by Tgs1. Sm proteins are then replaced by the Lsm2-8 complex, which promotes the association with the catalytic subunit and protects the mature 3'-end of TER1 from exonucleolytic degradation. Our findings define the sequence of events that occur during telomerase biogenesis and characterize roles for Sm and Lsm complexes as well as for the methylase Tgs1.","Tang, Wen; Kannan, Ram; Blanchette, Marco; Baumann, Peter","Tang, W; Kannan, R; Blanchette, M; Baumann, P",260,"[Tang, Wen; Kannan, Ram; Baumann, Peter] Howard Hughes Med Inst, Kansas City, MO 64110 USA; [Tang, Wen; Kannan, Ram; Blanchette, Marco; Baumann, Peter] Stowers Inst Med Res, Kansas City, MO 64110 USA; [Tang, Wen; Kannan, Ram; Baumann, Peter] Univ Kansas, Med Ctr, Dept Mol & Integrat Physiol, Kansas City, KS 66160 USA; [Blanchette, Marco] Univ Kansas, Med Ctr, Dept Pathol & Lab Med, Kansas City, KS 66160 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature10924,Article,,peb@stowers.org,U152,Stowers Institute for Medical Research; American Heart Association,"We thank S.

13,"Stresses acting on cold, thick and negatively buoyant oceanic lithosphere are thought to be crucial to the initiation of subduction and the operation of plate tectonics(1,2), which characterizes the present-day geodynamics of the Earth. Because the Earth's interior was hotter in the Archaean eon, the oceanic crust may have been thicker, thereby making the oceanic lithosphere more buoyant than at present(3), and whether subduction and plate tectonics occurred during this time is ambiguous, both in the geological record and in geodynamic models(4). Here we show that because the oceanic crust was thick and buoyant(5), early continents may have produced intra-lithospheric gravitational stresses large enough to drive their gravitational spreading, to initiate subduction at their margins and to trigger episodes of subduction. Our model predicts the co-occurrence of deep to progressively shallower mafic volcanics and arc magmatism within continents in a self-consistent geodynamic framework, explaining the enigmatic multimodal volcanism and tectonic record of Archaean cratons(6). Moreover, our model predicts a petrological stratification and tectonic structure of the sub-continental lithospheric mantle, two predictions that are consistent with xenolith(5) and seismic studies, respectively, and consistent with the existence of amid-lithospheric seismic discontinuity(7). The slow gravitational collapse of early continents could have kick-started transient episodes of plate tectonics until, as the Earth's interior cooled and oceanic lithosphere became heavier, plate tectonics became self-sustaining.","Rey, Patrice F.; Coltice, Nicolas; Flament, Nicolas","Rey, PF; Coltice, N; Flament, N",405,"[Rey, Patrice F.; Flament, Nicolas] Univ Sydney, Earthbyte Res Grp, Sch Geosci, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia; [Coltice, Nicolas] Univ Lyon 1, Ecole Normale Super Lyon, UMR CNRS 5276, Lab Geol Lyon, F-69622 Villeurbanne, France; [Coltice, Nicolas] Inst Univ France, F-75005 Paris, France",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature13728,Article,1476-4687,patrice.rey@sydney.edu.au,+,Australian Government; Institut Universitaire de France; European Research Council (ERC) [617588]; Statoil ASA,"We thank W.

14,"The jumonji (JMJ) family of histone demethylases are Fe2+ - and a-ketoglutarate-dependent oxygenases that are essential components of regulatory transcriptional chromatin complexes(1-4). These enzymes demethylate lysine residues in histones in a methylation-state and sequence-specific context(5). Considerable effort has been devoted to gaining a mechanistic understanding of the roles of histone lysine demethylases in eukaryotic transcription, genome integrity and epigenetic inheritance(2,4,6), as well as in development, physiology and disease(3,7). However, because of the absence of any selective inhibitors, the relevance of the demethylase activity of JMJ enzymes in regulating cellular responses remains poorly understood. Here we present a structure-guided small-molecule and chemoproteomics approach to elucidating the functional role of the H3K27me3-specific demethylase subfamily (KDM6 subfamily members JMJD3 and UTX)(8). The liganded structures of human and mouse JMJD3 provide novel insight into the specificity determinants for cofactor, substrate and inhibitor recognition by the KDM6 subfamily of demethylases. We exploited these structural features to generate the first small-molecule catalytic site inhibitor that is selective for the H3K27me3-specific JMJ subfamily. We demonstrate that this inhibitor binds in a novel manner and reduces lipopolysaccharide-induced proinflammatory cytokine production by human primary macrophages, a process that depends on both JMJD3 and UTX. Our results resolve the ambiguity associated with the catalytic function of H3K27-specific JMJs in regulating disease-relevant inflammatory responses and provide encouragement for designing small-molecule inhibitors to allow selective pharmacological intervention across the JMJ family.","Kruidenier, Laurens; Chung, Chun-wa; Cheng, Zhongjun; Liddle, John; Che, KaHing; Joberty, Gerard; Bantscheff, Marcus; Bountra, Chas; Bridges, Angela; Diallo, Hawa; Eberhard, Dirk; Hutchinson, Sue; Jones, Emma; Katso, Roy; Leveridge, Melanie; Mander, Palwinder K.; Mosley, Julie; Ramirez-Molina, Cesar; Rowland, Paul; Schofield, Christopher J.; Sheppard, Robert J.; Smith, Julia E.; Swales, Catherine; Tanner, Robert; Thomas, Pamela; Tumber, Anthony; Drewes, Gerard; Oppermann, Udo; Patel, Dinshaw J.; Lee, Kevin; Wilson, David M.","Kruidenier, L; Chung, CW; Cheng, ZJ; Liddle, J; Che, KH; Joberty, G; Bantscheff, M; Bountra, C; Bridges, A; Diallo, H; Eberhard, D; Hutchinson, S; Jones, E; Katso, R; Leveridge, M; Mander, PK; Mosley, J; Ramirez-Molina, C; Rowland, P; Schofield, CJ; Sheppard, RJ; Smith, JE; Swales, C; Tanner, R; Thomas, P; Tumber, A; Drewes, G; Oppermann, U; Patel, DJ; Lee, K; Wilson, DM",404,"[Kruidenier, Laurens; Liddle, John; Diallo, Hawa; Mander, Palwinder K.; Ramirez-Molina, Cesar; Sheppard, Robert J.; Smith, Julia E.; Lee, Kevin; Wilson, David M.] GlaxoSmithKline R&D, Med Res Ctr, Immunoinflammat Therapy Area, Epinova DPU, Stevenage SG1 2NY, Herts, England; [Chung, Chun-wa; Bridges, Angela; Hutchinson, Sue; Jones, Emma; Katso, Roy; Leveridge, Melanie; Mosley, Julie; Rowland, Paul; Tanner, Robert; Thomas, Pamela] GlaxoSmithKline R&D, Med Res Ctr, Platform Technol & Sci, Stevenage SG1 2NY, Herts, England; [Cheng, Zhongjun; Patel, Dinshaw J.] Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, New York, NY 10065 USA; [Che, KaHing; Bountra, Chas; Schofield, Christopher J.; Tumber, Anthony; Oppermann, Udo] Univ Oxford, Struct Genom Consortium, Headington OX3 7DQ, England; [Che, KaHing; Swales, Catherine; Oppermann, Udo] Univ Oxford, NIHR Biomed Res Unit, Botnar Res Ctr, Oxford OX3 7LD, England; [Joberty, Gerard; Bantscheff, Marcus; Eberhard, Dirk; Drewes, Gerard] Cellzome AG, D-69117 Heidelberg, Germany",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature11262,Article,1476-4687,david.m.wilson@gsk.com,408,"Starr Foundation; Abby Rockefeller Mauze Trust; Maloris Foundation; Canadian Institutes for Health Research; Canada Foundation for Innovation; Genome Canada; GlaxoSmithKline; Lilly Canada; Novartis Research Foundation; Pfizer; Takeda; Ontario Ministry of Economic Development and Innovation; Wellcome Trust; National Institute for Health and Research (NIHR) Biomedical Research Unit, Oxford","We thank the following colleagues for their help and advice in preparing the manuscript: A.

15,"Ubiquitin-like proteins (UBLs) can change protein function, localization or turnover by covalent attachment to lysine residues(1). Although UBLs achieve this conjugation through an intricate enzymatic cascade, their bacterial counterparts MoaD and ThiS function as sulphur carrier proteins(2,3). Here we show that Urm1p, the most ancient UBL3, acts as a sulphur carrier in the process of eukaryotic transfer RNA ( tRNA) modification, providing a possible evolutionary link between UBL and sulphur transfer. Moreover, we identify Uba4p, Ncs2p, Ncs6p and Yor251cp as components of this conserved pathway. Using in vitro assays, we show that Ncs6p binds to tRNA, whereas Uba4p first adenylates and then directly transfers sulphur onto Urm1p. Finally, functional analysis reveals that the thiolation function of Urm1p is critical to regulate cellular responses to nutrient starvation and oxidative stress conditions, most likely by increasing translation fidelity.","Leidel, Sebastian; Pedrioli, Patrick G.

16,"Latency and ongoing replication(1) have both been proposed to explain the drug-insensitive human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) reservoir maintained during antiretroviral therapy. Here we explore a novel mechanism for ongoing HIV replication in the face of antiretroviral drugs. We propose a model whereby multiple infections(2,3) per cell lead to reduced sensitivity to drugs without requiring drug-resistant mutations, and experimentally validate the model using multiple infections per cell by cell-free HIV in the presence of the drug tenofovir. We then examine the drug sensitivity of cell-to-cell spread of HIV(4-7), a mode of HIV transmission that can lead to multiple infection events per target cell(8-10). Infections originating from cell-free virus decrease strongly in the presence of antiretrovirals tenofovir and efavirenz whereas infections involving cell-to-cell spread are markedly less sensitive to the drugs. The reduction in sensitivity is sufficient to keep multiple rounds of infection from terminating in the presence of drugs. We examine replication from cell-to-cell spread in the presence of clinical drug concentrations using a stochastic infection model and find that replication is intermittent, without substantial accumulation of mutations. If cell-to-cell spread has the same properties in vivo, it may have adverse consequences for the immune system(11-13), lead to therapy failure in individuals with risk factors(14), and potentially contribute to viral persistence and hence be a barrier to curing HIV infection.","Sigal, Alex; Kim, Jocelyn T.; Balazs, Alejandro B.; Dekel, Erez; Mayo, Avi; Milo, Ron; Baltimore, David","Sigal, A; Kim, JT; Balazs, AB; Dekel, E; Mayo, A; Milo, R; Baltimore, D",95,"[Sigal, Alex; Kim, Jocelyn T.; Balazs, Alejandro B.; Baltimore, David] CALTECH, Div Biol, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA; [Kim, Jocelyn T.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, David Geffen Sch Med, Dept Med, Div Infect Dis, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Dekel, Erez; Mayo, Avi] Weizmann Inst Sci, Dept Mol Cell Biol, IL-76100 Rehovot, Israel; [Milo, Ron] Weizmann Inst Sci, Dept Plant Sci, IL-76100 Rehovot, Israel",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature10347,Article,,baltimo@caltech.edu,U100,Human Frontier Science Program [LT00946]; UCLA [T32 AI089398]; amfAR Postdoctoral Research Fellowship [107756-47-RFVA]; Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation; National Institutes of Health [HHSN266200500035C]; National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases; UCLA CFAR Virology Core Lab [P01-AI-28697]; UCSF-GIVI CFAR [P30-AI-27763],"We thank B.

18,"Only three elements are ferromagnetic at room temperature: the transition metals iron, cobalt and nickel. The Stoner criterion explains why iron is ferromagnetic but manganese, for example, is not, even though both elements have an unfilled 3d shell and are adjacent in the periodic table: according to this criterion, the product of the density of states and the exchange integral must be greater than unity for spontaneous spin ordering to emerge(1,2). Here we demonstrate that it is possible to alter the electronic states of non-ferromagnetic materials, such as diamagnetic copper and paramagnetic manganese, to overcome the Stoner criterion and make them ferromagnetic at room temperature. This effect is achieved via interfaces between metallic thin films and C-60 molecular layers. The emergent ferromagnetic state exists over several layers of the metal before being quenched at large sample thicknesses by the material's bulk properties. Although the induced magnetization is easily measurable by magnetometry, low-energy muon spin spectroscopy(3) provides insight into its distribution by studying the depolarization process of low-energy muons implanted in the sample. This technique indicates localized spin-ordered states at, and close to, the metal-molecule interface. Density functional theory simulations suggest a mechanism based on magnetic hardening of the metal atoms, owing to electron transfer(4,5). This mechanism might allow for the exploitation of molecular coupling to design magnetic metamaterials using abundant, non-toxic components such as organic semiconductors. Charge transfer at molecular interfaces may thus be used to control spin polarization or magnetization, with consequences for the design of devices for electronic, power or computing applications (see, for example, refs 6 and 7).","Al Ma'Mari, Fatma; Moorsom, Timothy; Teobaldi, Gilberto; Deacon, William; Prokscha, Thomas; Luetkens, Hubertus; Lee, Steve; Sterbinsky, George E.; Arena, Dario A.; MacLaren, Donald A.; Flokstra, Machiel; Ali, Mannan; Wheeler, May C.; Burnell, Gavin; Hickey, Bryan J.; Cespedes, Oscar","Al Ma'Mari, F; Moorsom, T; Teobaldi, G; Deacon, W; Prokscha, T; Luetkens, H; Lee, S; Sterbinsky, GE; Arena, DA; MacLaren, DA; Flokstra, M; Ali, M; Wheeler, MC; Burnell, G; Hickey, BJ; Cespedes, O",69,"[Al Ma'Mari, Fatma; Moorsom, Timothy; Deacon, William; Ali, Mannan; Wheeler, May C.; Burnell, Gavin; Hickey, Bryan J.; Cespedes, Oscar] Univ Leeds, Sch Phys & Astron, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England; [Teobaldi, Gilberto] Univ Liverpool, Stephenson Inst Renewable Energy, Dept Chem, Liverpool L69 3BX, Merseyside, England; [Prokscha, Thomas; Luetkens, Hubertus] Paul Scherrer Inst, Lab Muon Spin Spect, CH-5232 Villigen, Switzerland; [Lee, Steve; Flokstra, Machiel] Univ St Andrews, Sch Phys & Astron, SUPA, St Andrews KY16 9SS, Fife, Scotland; [Sterbinsky, George E.; Arena, Dario A.] Brookhaven Natl Lab, Photon Sci Directorate, Upton, NY 11973 USA; [MacLaren, Donald A.] Univ Glasgow, Sch Phys & Astron, SUPA, Glasgow G12 8QQ, Lanark, Scotland",,,11/19/17,,10.1038/nature14621,Article,1476-4687,o.cespedes@leeds.ac.uk,U128,"Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council [EP/K00512X/1, EP/K036408/1, EP/J01060X/1, EP/I004483/1]; US Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences [DE-AC02-98CH10886]","This work was supported by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council through grants EP/K00512X/1, EP/K036408/1, EP/J01060X/1 and EP/I004483/1.

19,"Genomic studies have shown that Neanderthals interbred with modern humans, and that non-Africans today are the products of this mixture(1,2). The antiquity of Neanderthal gene flow into modern humans means that genomic regions that derive from Neanderthals in any one human today are usually less than a hundred kilobases in size. However, Neanderthal haplotypes are also distinctive enough that several studies have been able to detect Neanderthal ancestry at specific loci(1,3-8). We systematically infer Neanderthal haplotypes in the genomes of 1,004 present-day humans(9). Regions that harbour a high frequency of Neanderthal alleles are enriched for genes affecting keratin filaments, suggesting that Neanderthal alleles may have helped modern humans to adapt to non-African environments. We identify multiple Neanderthal-derived alleles that confer risk for disease, suggesting that Neanderthal alleles continue to shape human biology. An unexpected finding is that regions with reduced Neanderthal ancestry are enriched in genes, implying selection to remove genetic material derived from Neanderthals. Genes that are more highly expressed in testes than in any other tissue are especially reduced in Neanderthal ancestry, and there is an approximately fivefold reduction of Neanderthal ancestry on the X chromosome, which is known from studies of diverse species to be especially dense in male hybrid sterility genes(10-12). These results suggest that part of the explanation for genomic regions of reduced Neanderthal ancestry is Neanderthal alleles that caused decreased fertility in males when moved to a modern human genetic background.","Sankararaman, Sriram; Mallick, Swapan; Dannemann, Michael; Pruefer, Kay; Kelso, Janet; Paeaebo, Svante; Patterson, Nick; Reich, David","Sankararaman, S; Mallick, S; Dannemann, M; Prufer, K; Kelso, J; Paabo, S; Patterson, N; Reich, D",354,"[Sankararaman, Sriram; Mallick, Swapan; Patterson, Nick; Reich, David] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Genet, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Sankararaman, Sriram; Mallick, Swapan; Patterson, Nick; Reich, David] Broad Inst Harvard & MIT, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; [Dannemann, Michael; Pruefer, Kay; Kelso, Janet; Paeaebo, Svante] Max Planck Inst Evolutionary Anthropol, D-04103 Leipzig, Germany; [Reich, David] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Boston, MA 02115 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature12961,Article,1476-4687,sankararaman@genetics.med.harvard.edu; reich@genetics.med.harvard.edu,+,Presidential Innovation Fund of the Max Planck Society; NSF HOMINID [1032255]; NIH [GM100233]; Initiative for the Science of the Human Past at Harvard University,"We thank A.

20,"Genetic studies have consistently indicated a single common origin of Native American groups from Central and South America(1-4). However, some morphological studies have suggested a more complex picture, whereby the northeast Asian affinities of present-day Native Americans contrast with a distinctive morphology seen in some of the earliest American skeletons, which share traits with present-day Australasians (indigenous groups in Australia, Melanesia, and island Southeast Asia)(5-8). Here we analyse genome-wide data to show that some Amazonian Native Americans descend partly from a Native American founding population that carried ancestry more closely related to indigenous Australians, New Guineans and Andaman Islanders than to any present-day Eurasians or Native Americans. This signature is not present to the same extent, or at all, in present-day Northern and Central Americans or in a similar to 12,600-year-old Clovis-associated genome, suggesting a more diverse set of founding populations of the Americas than previously accepted.","Skoglund, Pontus; Mallick, Swapan; Bortolini, Maria Catira; Chennagiri, Niru; Huenemeier, Tabita; Petzl-Erler, Maria Luiza; Salzano, Francisco Mauro; Patterson, Nick; Reich, David","Skoglund, P; Mallick, S; Bortolini, MC; Chennagiri, N; Hunemeier, T; Petzl-Erler, ML; Salzano, FM; Patterson, N; Reich, D",104,"[Skoglund, Pontus; Mallick, Swapan; Chennagiri, Niru; Reich, David] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Genet, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Skoglund, Pontus; Mallick, Swapan; Chennagiri, Niru; Patterson, Nick; Reich, David] Broad Inst Harvard & MIT, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; [Mallick, Swapan; Reich, David] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Bortolini, Maria Catira; Salzano, Francisco Mauro] Univ Fed Rio Grande do Sul, Inst Biociencias, BR-91501970 Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil; [Huenemeier, Tabita] Univ Sao Paulo, Dept Genet Biol Evolut, BR-05508090 Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil; [Petzl-Erler, Maria Luiza] Univ Fed Parana, Dept Genet, BR-81531980 Curitiba, PR, Brazil",,,11/19/17,,10.1038/nature14895,Article,1476-4687,skoglund@genetics.med.harvard.edu; reich@genetics.med.harvard.edu,+,Conselho Nacional do Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (Brazil); Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (Brazil); Wenner-Gren foundation; Swedish Research Council (VR) [2014-453]; US National Science Foundation HOMINID [BCS-1032255]; US National Institutes of Health [GM100233]; Simons Foundation [280376]; Howard Hughes Medical Institute,"We are grateful to the Native American volunteers who contributed the DNA samples used to generate the new data reported in this study and to the Fundacao Nacional do Indio (FUNAI, Brazil) for logistical support in sample collection.

21,"Inhomogeneity-induced magnetoresistance (IMR) reported in some non-magnetic semiconductors(1-8), particularly silicon(1,6-8), has generated considerable interest owing to the large magnitude of the effect and its linear field dependence (albeit at high magnetic fields). Various theories implicate(9-18) spatial variation of the carrier mobility as being responsible for IMR. Here we show that IMR in lightly doped silicon can be significantly enhanced through hole injection, and then tuned by an applied current to arise at low magnetic fields. In our devices, the 'inhomogeneity' is provided by the p-n boundary formed between regions where conduction is dominated by the minority and majority charge carriers (holes and electrons) respectively; application of a magnetic field distorts the current in the boundary region, resulting in large magnetoresistance. Because this is an intrinsically spatial effect, the geometry of the device can be used to enhance IMR further: we designed an IMR device whose room-temperature field sensitivity at low fields was greatly improved, with magnetoresistance reaching 10% at 0.07 T and 100% at 0.2 T, approaching the performance of commercial giant-magnetoresistance devices(19,20). The combination of high sensitivity to low magnetic fields and large high-field response should make this device concept attractive to the magnetic-field sensing industry. Moreover, because our device is based on a conventional silicon platform, it should be possible to integrate it with existing silicon devices and so aid the development of silicon-based magnetoelectronics.","Wan, Caihua; Zhang, Xiaozhong; Gao, Xili; Wang, Jimin; Tan, Xinyu","Wan, CH; Zhang, XZ; Gao, XL; Wang, JM; Tan, XY",304,"[Wan, Caihua; Zhang, Xiaozhong; Gao, Xili; Wang, Jimin; Tan, Xinyu] Tsinghua Univ, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Adv Mat Lab, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China; [Wan, Caihua; Zhang, Xiaozhong; Gao, Xili; Wang, Jimin; Tan, Xinyu] Tsinghua Univ, Beijing Natl Ctr Electron Microscopy, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature10375,Article,,xzzhang@tsinghua.edu.cn,U68,"Ministry of Science and Technology of China [2009CB929202]; National Science Foundation of China [11074141, U0734001]",This work is supported by the Ministry of Science and Technology of China (grant 2009CB929202) and the National Science Foundation of China (grants 11074141 and U0734001).

22,"Targeted protein degradation is largely performed by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, in which substrate proteins are marked by covalently attached ubiquitin chains that mediate recognition by the proteasome. It is currently unclear how the proteasome recognizes its substrates, as the only established ubiquitin receptor intrinsic to the proteasome is Rpn10/S5a (ref. 1), which is not essential for ubiquitin- mediated protein degradation in budding yeast(2). In the accompanying manuscript we report that Rpn13 (refs 3-7), a component of the nine-subunit proteasome base, functions as a ubiquitin receptor(8), complementing its known role in docking de-ubiquitinating enzyme Uch37/UCHL5 (refs 4-6) to the proteasome. Here we merge crystallography and NMRdata to describe the ubiquitin-binding mechanism of Rpn13. We determine the structure of Rpn13 alone and complexed with ubiquitin. The co-complex reveals a novel ubiquitin-binding mode in which loops rather than secondary structural elements are used to capture ubiquitin. Further support for the role of Rpn13 as a proteasomal ubiquitin receptor is demonstrated by its ability to bind ubiquitin and proteasome subunit Rpn2/S1 simultaneously. Finally, we provide a model structure of Rpn13 complexed to diubiquitin, which provides insights into how Rpn13 as a ubiquitin receptor is coupled to substrate deubiquitination by Uch37.","Schreiner, Patrick; Chen, Xiang; Husnjak, Koraljka; Randles, Leah; Zhang, Naixia; Elsasser, Suzanne; Finley, Daniel; Dikic, Ivan; Walters, Kylie J.; Groll, Michael","Schreiner, P; Chen, X; Husnjak, K; Randles, L; Zhang, NX; Elsasser, S; Finley, D; Dikic, I; Walters, KJ; Groll, M",548,"[Schreiner, Patrick; Groll, Michael] Tech Univ Munich, Ctr Integrated Prot Sci, Dept Chem, Lehrstuhl Biochem, D-85747 Garching, Germany; [Chen, Xiang; Randles, Leah; Zhang, Naixia; Walters, Kylie J.] Univ Minnesota, Dept Biochem Mol Biol & Biophys, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA; [Husnjak, Koraljka; Dikic, Ivan] Univ Frankfurt, Inst Biochem 2, D-60590 Frankfurt, Germany; [Husnjak, Koraljka; Dikic, Ivan] Mediterranean Inst Life Sci, Tumor Biol Program, Split 21000, Croatia; [Elsasser, Suzanne; Finley, Daniel] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Cell Biol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Dikic, Ivan] Univ Split, Sch Med, Dept Immunol, Split 21000, Croatia; [Groll, Michael] Charite Univ Med Berlin CCM, Inst Biochem, D-10117 Berlin, Germany",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature06924,Article,,ivan.dikic@biochem2.de; walte048@umn.edu; michael.groll@ch.tum.de,552,"NCI NIH HHS [CA097004, R01 CA097004, R01 CA097004-05, R01 CA097004-06A1]; NIGMS NIH HHS [GM43601, GM008700, R01 GM043601, R37 GM043601, R37 GM043601-17, T32 GM008700, T32 GM008700-09]",,303EL,,,DEUBIQUITINATING ENZYME; STRUCTURAL BASIS; MULTIUBIQUITIN CHAIN; PROTEIN INTERACTOME; EAP45-GLUE DOMAIN; RECOGNITION; DEGRADATION; COMPLEX; BINDING; SUBUNIT,7194,NATURE,Nature,English,28,No,"Dikic, Ivan/0000-0001-8156-9511; Husnjak, Koraljka/0000-0003-0573-6239","MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",22-May,5,LONDON,18497827.0,J,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2008,"Groll, Michael/C-1174-2010; Chen, Xiang/E-2840-2010; Groll, Michael/F-5572-2015; Dikic, Ivan/O-4650-2015; Husnjak, Koraljka/C-3717-2015","Groll, M (reprint author), Tech Univ Munich, Ctr Integrated Prot Sci, Dept Chem, Lehrstuhl Biochem, Lichtenbergstr 4, D-85747 Garching, Germany.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,0028-0836,NATURE,192,Ubiquitin docking at the proteasome through a novel pleckstrin-homology domain interaction,2,27,WOS:000256023700048,318,453,Multidisciplinary Sciences,198,michael,groll,80,11094,male,0,0,na,na,na,0,0,na,1.0,1,"[0, 1474]",53LjSh4AAAAJ
23,"Resolving flow geometry in the mantle wedge is central to understanding the thermal and chemical structure of subduction zones, subducting plate dehydration, and melting that leads to arc volcanism, which can threaten large populations and alter climate through gas and particle emission. Here we show that isotope geochemistry and seismic velocity anisotropy provide strong evidence for trench- parallel flow in the mantle wedge beneath Costa Rica and Nicaragua. This finding contradicts classical models, which predict trench- normal flow owing to the overlying wedge mantle being dragged downwards by the subducting plate. The isotopic signature of central Costa Rican volcanic rocks is not consistent with its derivation from the mantle wedge(1-3) or eroded fore- arc complexes(4) but instead from seamounts of the Galapagos hotspot track on the subducting Cocos plate. This isotopic signature decreases continuously from central Costa Rica to northwestern Nicaragua. As the age of the isotopic signature beneath Costa Rica can be constrained and its transport distance is known, minimum northwestward flow rates can be estimated ( 63 - 190 mm yr(-1)) and are comparable to the magnitude of subducting Cocos plate motion (similar to 85 mm yr(-1)). Trench- parallel flow needs to be taken into account in models evaluating thermal and chemical structure and melt generation in subduction zones.","Hoernle, Kaj; Abt, David L.; Fischer, Karen M.; Nichols, Holly; Hauff, Folkmar; Abers, Geoffrey A.; van den Bogaard, Paul; Heydolph, Ken; Alvarado, Guillermo; Protti, Marino; Strauch, Wilfried","Hoernle, K; Abt, DL; Fischer, KM; Nichols, H; Hauff, F; Abers, GA; van den Bogaard, P; Heydolph, K; Alvarado, G; Protti, M; Strauch, W",1094,"[Hoernle, Kaj; Nichols, Holly; van den Bogaard, Paul; Heydolph, Ken] Univ Kiel, SFB 574, D-24148 Kiel, Germany; [Hoernle, Kaj; Hauff, Folkmar; van den Bogaard, Paul] Univ Kiel, Leibniz Inst Marine Sci, IFM GEOMAR, D-24148 Kiel, Germany; [Abt, David L.; Fischer, Karen M.] Brown Univ, Dept Geol Sci, Providence, RI 02912 USA; [Abers, Geoffrey A.] Boston Univ, Dept Earth Sci, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Alvarado, Guillermo] ICE, OSIVAM, Heredia 1000, Costa Rica; [Protti, Marino] Univ Nacl, Observ Vulcanol & Sismol Costa Rica, Heredia 3000, Costa Rica; [Strauch, Wilfried] Inst Nicaraguense Estud Terr, Managua, Nicaragua",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature06550,Article,,khoernle@ifm-geomar.de,U4,,,266RB,,,CENTRAL-AMERICAN ARC; SEISMIC ANISOTROPY; SHEAR-WAVE; ELASTIC-CONSTANTS; BACK-ARC; OLIVINE; HISTORY; ASTHENOSPHERE; VOLCANO; MA,7182,NATURE,Nature,English,37,No,"Protti, Marino/0000-0001-9818-0051","MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",28-Feb,5,LONDON,18223639.0,J,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2008,"GEOFON, GlobalSeismicNetwork/E-4273-2012","Hoernle, K (reprint author), Univ Kiel, SFB 574, Wischhofstr 1-3, D-24148 Kiel, Germany.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,0028-0836,NATURE,124,Arc-parallel flow in the mantle wedge beneath Costa Rica and Nicaragua,2,19,WOS:000253453600039,492,451,Multidisciplinary Sciences,129,wilfried,strauch,1457,35,male,0,0,na,na,na,0,0,na,1.0,1,"[0, 1474]",CVjk25QAAAAJ
24,"Temporal changes in the Earth's magnetic field, known as geomagnetic secular variation, occur most prominently at low latitudes in the Atlantic hemisphere(1,2) (that is, from 290 degrees east to 90 degrees east), whereas in the Pacific hemisphere there is comparatively little activity. This is a consequence of the geographical localization of intense, westward drifting, equatorial magnetic flux patches at the core surface(3). Despite successes in explaining the morphology of the geomagnetic field(4), numerical models of the geodynamo have so far failed to account systematically for this striking pattern of geomagnetic secular variation. Here we show that it can be reproduced provided that two mechanisms relying on the inner core are jointly considered. First, gravitational coupling(5) aligns the inner core with the mantle, forcing the flow of liquid metal in the outer core into a giant, westward drifting, sheet-like gyre(6). The resulting shear concentrates azimuthal magnetic flux at low latitudes close to the core-mantle boundary, where it is expelled by core convection and subsequently transported westward. Second, differential inner-core growth(7,8), fastest below Indonesia(6,9), causes an asymmetric buoyancy release in the outer core which in turn distorts the gyre, forcing it to become eccentric, in agreement with recent core flow inversions(6,10,11). This bottom-up heterogeneous driving of core convection dominates top-down driving from mantle thermal heterogeneities, and localizes magnetic variations in a longitudinal sector centred beneath the Atlantic, where the eccentric gyre reaches the core surface. To match the observed pattern of geomagnetic secular variation, the solid material forming the inner core must now be in a state of differential growth rather than one of growth and melting induced by convective translation(7,8).","Aubert, Julien; Finlay, Christopher C.; Fournier, Alexandre","Aubert, J; Finlay, CC; Fournier, A",219,"[Aubert, Julien; Fournier, Alexandre] Univ Paris Diderot, Inst Phys Globe Paris, Sorbonne Paris Cite, UMR 7154,CNRS, F-75005 Paris, France; [Finlay, Christopher C.] Tech Univ Denmark, Natl Space Inst, Div Geomagnetism, DK-2800 Lyngby, Denmark",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature12574,Article,1476-4687,aubert@ipgp.fr,+,"French Agence Nationale de la Recherche [ANR-2011-BS56-011]; GENCI-IDRIS [2012-042122, 2013-042122]","This work was supported by the French Agence Nationale de la Recherche (grant ANR-2011-BS56-011).

25,"Many organisms can enter a dormant state or diapause to survive harsh environmental conditions for extended durations. When Caenorhabditis elegans larvae enter dauer they arrest feeding but remain active and motile, yet become stress- resistant, extremely long- lived and non- ageing(1). Entry into dauer is associated with a reduction in insulin- like signalling, the accumulation of nutritive resources and a concomitant global change in metabolism(2-5), yet the precise molecular and physiological processes that enable long- term survival in the absence of caloric intake remain largely unknown. We show here that C. elegans larvae that lack LKB1/ AMPK (AMP-activated protein kinase) signalling enter dauer normally, but then rapidly consume their stored energy and prematurely expire following vital organ failure. We found that this signalling pathway acts in adipose- like tissues to downregulate triglyceride hydrolysis so that these lipid reserves are rationed to last the entire duration of the arrest. Indeed, the downregulation of adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL-1) activity suppresses both the rapid depletion of stored lipids and reduced life span of AMPK mutant dauers, while AMPK directly phosphorylates ATGL-1. Finally, we show that the slow release of energy during dauer is critical for appropriate long- term osmoregulation, which fails as triglyceride resources become depleted. These mechanisms may be essential for survival through diapause, hibernation, or long- term fasting in diverse organisms and may also underlie AMPK- dependent life span extension.","Narbonne, Patrick; Roy, Richard","Narbonne, P; Roy, R",210,"[Narbonne, Patrick; Roy, Richard] McGill Univ, Dept Biol, Montreal, PQ H3A 1B1, Canada",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature07536,Article,,richard.roy@mcgill.ca,U108,Canadian Cancer Society; Canadian Institutes of Health Research,"We thank A.

26,"Understanding the dynamics of correlated many-body quantum systems is a challenge for modern physics. Owing to the simplicity of theirHamiltonians, He-4 (bosons) and He-3 (fermions) have served as model systems for strongly interacting quantum fluids, with substantial efforts devoted to their understanding. An important milestone was the direct observation of the collective phonon-roton mode in liquid He-4 by neutron scattering, verifying Landau's prediction(1) and his fruitful concept of elementary excitations. In a Fermi system, collective density fluctuations (known as 'zero-sound' in He-3, and 'plasmons' in charged systems) and incoherent particle-hole excitations are observed. At small wavevectors and energies, both types of excitation are described by Landau's theory of Fermi liquids(2,3). At higher wavevectors, the collectivemode enters the particle-hole band, where it is strongly damped. The dynamics of Fermi liquids at high wavevectors was thus believed to be essentially incoherent. Here we report inelastic neutron scattering measurements of a monolayer of liquid He-3, observing a roton-like excitation. We find that the collective density mode reappears as a well defined excitation atmomentum transfers larger than twice the Fermi momentum. We thus observe unexpected collective behaviour of a Fermi many-body system in the regime beyond the scope of Landau's theory. A satisfactory interpretation of the measured spectra is obtained using a dynamic many-body theory(4).","Godfrin, Henri; Meschke, Matthias; Lauter, Hans-Jochen; Sultan, Ahmad; Boehm, Helga M.; Krotscheck, Eckhard; Panholzer, Martin","Godfrin, H; Meschke, M; Lauter, HJ; Sultan, A; Bohm, HM; Krotscheck, E; Panholzer, M",576,"[Godfrin, Henri; Meschke, Matthias; Sultan, Ahmad] CNRS, Inst Neel, F-38042 Grenoble 9, France; [Godfrin, Henri; Meschke, Matthias; Sultan, Ahmad] Univ Grenoble 1, F-38042 Grenoble 9, France; [Meschke, Matthias] Aalto Univ, Low Temp Lab, Aalto 00076, Finland; [Lauter, Hans-Jochen] Inst Laue Langevin, F-38042 Grenoble 9, France; [Lauter, Hans-Jochen] Oak Ridge Natl Lab, Oak Ridge, TN 37831 USA; [Boehm, Helga M.; Krotscheck, Eckhard; Panholzer, Martin] Johannes Kepler Univ Linz, Inst Theoret Phys, A-4040 Linz, Austria; [Krotscheck, Eckhard] SUNY Buffalo, Dept Phys, Buffalo, NY 14260 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature10919,Article,,henri.godfrin@grenoble.cnrs.fr,579,Austrian Fonds zur Forderung der wissenschaftlichen Forschung (FWF) [P21264]; French Agence Nationale de la Recherche [ANR-2010-INTB-403-01]; EU [228464],"We are grateful to the Austrian-French programme Amadeus for providing initial support; to the Austrian Fonds zur Forderung der wissenschaftlichen Forschung (FWF grant P21264), the French Agence Nationale de la Recherche (project ANR-2010-INTB-403-01) and the EU FRP7 low-temperature infrastructure grant Microkelvin (project number 228464) for funding this research; and to the Institut Laue-Langevin for use of the facility.",915EF,,,ELEMENTARY EXCITATIONS; EFFECTIVE-MASS; NEUTRON-SCATTERING; SPIN FLUCTUATIONS; ZERO SOUND; HE-3; FILMS; PLASMONS; GRAPHITE; DYNAMICS,7391,NATURE,Nature,English,31,No,,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",29-Mar,4,LONDON,22460903.0,J,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2012,"Meschke, Matthias/G-5166-2012","Godfrin, H (reprint author), CNRS, Inst Neel, BP 166, F-38042 Grenoble 9, France.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,0028-0836,NATURE,17,Observation of a roton collective mode in a two-dimensional Fermi liquid,5,40,WOS:000302006100034,153,483,Multidisciplinary Sciences,17,martin,panholzer,118,3568,male,1,1,143848,143848,List of suicides,0,0,List of suicides,1.0,1,"[0, 1474]",oDRnEUgAAAAJ

Zonal flow formation in nuclear fusion devices is also well studied(2). A common feature of these zonal flows is that they are spontaneously generated in turbulent systems. Because the Earth's outer core is believed to be in a turbulent state, it is possible that there is zonal flow in the liquid iron of the outer core. Here we report an investigation at the current low-viscosity limit of numerical simulations of the geodynamo. We find a previously unknown convection regime of the outer core that has a dual structure comprising inner, sheet-like radial plumes and an outer, westward cylindrical zonal flow.

Here we develop a framework for studying this variation and apply it to about 20 million base pairs of aligned sequence from humans, chimpanzees, gorillas and more distantly related primates. Human-chimpanzee genetic divergence varies from less than 84% to more than 147% of the average, a range of more than 4 million years. Our analysis also shows that human-chimpanzee speciation occurred less than 6.3 million years ago and probably more recently, conflicting with some interpretations of ancient fossils. Most strikingly, chromosome X shows an extremely young genetic divergence time, close to the genome minimum along nearly its entire length. These unexpected features would be explained if the human and chimpanzee lineages initially diverged, then later exchanged genes before separating permanently.","Patterson, Nick; Richter, Daniel J.; Gnerre, Sante; Lander, Eric S.; Reich, David","Patterson, N; Richter, DJ; Gnerre, S; Lander, ES; Reich, D",1103,"Harvard Univ, Broad Inst, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; MIT, Broad Inst, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; MIT, Dept Biol, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Genet, Boston, MA 02115 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature04789,Article,1476-4687,reich@genetics.med.harvard.edu,1108,,,057SM,,,ANCESTRAL POPULATION SIZES; DNA-SEQUENCES; DIVERGENCE TIMES; UPPER MIOCENE; DROSOPHILA-MAURITIANA; MAMMALIAN EVOLUTION; GENOME SEQUENCE; HOMINID; CHAD; PALEONTOLOGY,7097,NATURE,Nature,English,43,No,"Richter, Daniel/0000-0002-9238-5571","MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",28-Jun,6,LONDON,16710306.0,J,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2006,,"Reich, D (reprint author), Harvard Univ, Broad Inst, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,0028-0836,NATURE,319,Genetic evidence for complex speciation of humans and chimpanzees,4,100,WOS:000238615500040,370,441,Multidisciplinary Sciences,326,david,reich,14,12593,male,0,0,na,na,na,0,0,na,1.0,1,"[0, 1474]",rK-2mFQAAAAJ
29,"The mass and chemical composition of a star are the primary determinants of its basic physical properties - radius, temperature and luminosity - and how those properties evolve with time(1). Accordingly, two stars born at the same time, from the same natal material and with the same mass, are 'identical twins,' and as such might be expected to possess identical physical attributes. We have discovered in the Orion nebula a pair of stellar twins in a newborn binary star system(2). Each star in the binary has a mass of 0.41 +/- 0.01 solar masses, identical to within 2 per cent. Here we report that these twin stars have surface temperatures differing by similar to 300 K (similar to 10 per cent) and luminosities differing by similar to 50 per cent, both at high confidence level. Preliminary results indicate that the stars' radii also differ, by 5 - 10 per cent. These surprising dissimilarities suggest that one of the twins may have been delayed by several hundred thousand years in its formation relative to its sibling. Such a delay could only have been detected in a very young, definitively equal-mass binary system(3). Our findings reveal cosmic limits on the age synchronization of young binary stars, often used as tests for the age calibrations of star-formation models(4).","Stassun, Keivan G.; Mathieu, Robert D.; Cargile, Phillip A.; Aarnio, Alicia N.; Stempels, Eric; Geller, Aaron","Stassun, KG; Mathieu, RD; Cargile, PA; Aarnio, AN; Stempels, E; Geller, A",1079,"[Stassun, Keivan G.; Cargile, Phillip A.; Aarnio, Alicia N.] Vanderbilt Univ, Dept Phys & Astron, Nashville, TN 37235 USA; [Mathieu, Robert D.; Geller, Aaron] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Astron, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Stempels, Eric] Univ St Andrews, Sch Phys & Astron, St Andrews KY16 9SS, Fife, Scotland",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature07069,Article,,keivan.stassun@vanderbilt.edu,1082,,,314WM,,,ORION NEBULA CLUSTER; SEQUENCE ECLIPSING BINARY; LOW-MASS; ABSOLUTE CALIBRATION; FORMING REGION; BROWN DWARFS; SYSTEM; 2MASS; TEMPERATURES; PHOTOMETRY,7198,NATURE,Nature,English,29,No,,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",19-Jun,4,LONDON,18563159.0,J,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2008,,"Stassun, KG (reprint author), Vanderbilt Univ, Dept Phys & Astron, Nashville, TN 37235 USA.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,0028-0836,NATURE,39,Surprising dissimilarities in a newly formed pair of 'identical twin' stars,0,3,WOS:000256839900051,238,453,Multidisciplinary Sciences,40,aaron,geller,1008,2280,male,1,1,34068800,5923637,Laura Geller,1,1,Laura Geller,1.0,1,"[0, 1474]",PyNOB1EAAAAJ
30,"Discovering the structure and dynamics of transcriptional regulatory events in the genome with cellular and temporal resolution is crucial to understanding the regulatory underpinnings of development and disease. We determined the genomic distribution of binding sites for 92 transcription factors and regulatory proteins across multiple stages of Caenorhabditis elegans development by performing 241 ChIP-seq (chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing) experiments. Integration of regulatory binding and cellular-resolution expression data produced a spatio-temporally resolved metazoan transcription factor binding map. Using this map, we explore developmental regulatory circuits that encode combinatorial logic at the levels of co-binding and co-expression of transcription factors, characterizing the genomic coverage and clustering of regulatory binding, the binding preferences of, and biological processes regulated by, transcription factors, the global transcription factor co-associations and genomic subdomains that suggest shared patterns of regulation, and identifying key transcription factors and transcription factor co-associations for fate specification of individual lineages and cell types.","Araya, Carlos L.; Kawli, Trupti; Kundaje, Anshul; Jiang, Lixia; Wu, Beijing; Vafeados, Dionne; Terrell, Robert; Weissdepp, Peter; Gevirtzman, Louis; Mace, Daniel; Niu, Wei; Boyle, Alan P.; Xie, Dan; Ma, Lijia; Murray, John I.; Reinke, Valerie; Waterston, Robert H.; Snyder, Michael","Araya, CL; Kawli, T; Kundaje, A; Jiang, LX; Wu, BJ; Vafeados, D; Terrell, R; Weissdepp, P; Gevirtzman, L; Mace, D; Niu, W; Boyle, AP; Xie, D; Ma, LJ; Murray, JI; Reinke, V; Waterston, RH; Snyder, M",400,"[Araya, Carlos L.; Kawli, Trupti; Jiang, Lixia; Wu, Beijing; Boyle, Alan P.; Xie, Dan; Snyder, Michael] Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Dept Genet, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Kundaje, Anshul] MIT, Dept Comp Sci, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Vafeados, Dionne; Terrell, Robert; Weissdepp, Peter; Gevirtzman, Louis; Mace, Daniel; Waterston, Robert H.] Univ Washington, Dept Genome Sci, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Niu, Wei; Reinke, Valerie] Yale Univ, Sch Med, Dept Genet, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Ma, Lijia] Univ Chicago, Inst Genom & Syst Biol, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Murray, John I.] Univ Penn, Perelman Sch Med, Dept Genet, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature13497,Article,1476-4687,watersto@u.washington.edu; mpsnyder@stanford.edu,U363,NHGRI as part of the modENCODE project [U01 HG004267],"We thank G.

31,"Animals locate and track chemoattractive gradients in the environment to find food. With its small nervous system, Caenorhabditis elegans is a good model system(1,2) in which to understand how the dynamics of neural activity control this search behaviour. Extensive work on the nematode has identified the neurons that are necessary for the different locomotory behaviours underlying chemotaxis through the use of laser ablation(3-7), activity recording in immobilized animals and the study of mutants(4,5). However, we do not know the neural activity patterns in C. elegans that are sufficient to control its complex chemotactic behaviour. To understand how the activity in its interneurons coordinate different motor programs to lead the animal to food, here we used optogenetics and new optical tools to manipulate neural activity directly in freely moving animals to evoke chemotactic behaviour. By deducing the classes of activity patterns triggered during chemotaxis and exciting individual neurons with these patterns, we identified interneurons that control the essential locomotory programs for this behaviour. Notably, we discovered that controlling the dynamics of activity in just one interneuron pair (AIY) was sufficient to force the animal to locate, turn towards and track virtual light gradients. Two distinct activity patterns triggered in AIY as the animal moved through the gradient controlled reversals and gradual turns to drive chemotactic behaviour. Because AIY neurons are post-synaptic to most chemosensory and thermosensory neurons(8), it is probable that these activity patterns in AIY have an important role in controlling and coordinating different taxis behaviours of the animal.","Kocabas, Askin; Shen, Ching-Han; Guo, Zengcai V.; Ramanathan, Sharad","Kocabas, A; Shen, CH; Guo, ZCV; Ramanathan, S",273,"[Kocabas, Askin; Shen, Ching-Han; Ramanathan, Sharad] Harvard Univ, FAS Ctr Syst Biol, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Kocabas, Askin; Shen, Ching-Han; Ramanathan, Sharad] Harvard Univ, Dept Mol & Cellular Biol, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Guo, Zengcai V.] Howard Hughes Med Inst, Ashburn, VA 20147 USA; [Ramanathan, Sharad] Allen Inst Brain Sci, Seattle, WA 98103 USA; [Ramanathan, Sharad] Harvard Univ, Harvard Stem Cell Inst, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Ramanathan, Sharad] Harvard Univ, Sch Engn & Appl Sci, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature11431,Article,,akocabas@cgr.harvard.edu; sharad@post.harvard.edu,+,"Human Frontier Science Program (HFSP) Postdoctoral Fellowship; National Science Foundation (NSF) Graduate Fellowship; NSF Career Award; Pew Scholar, Klingenstein Fellowship Award; National Institutes of Health (NIH) Pioneer Awards","We thank J.

32,"The El Nino/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) system during the Pliocene warm period (PWP; 3-5 million years ago) may have existed in a permanent El Nino state with a sharply reduced zonal sea surface temperature (SST) gradient in the equatorial Pacific Ocean(1). This suggests that during the PWP, when global mean temperatures and atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations were similar to those projected for near-term climate change(2), ENSO variability-and related global climate teleconnections-could have been radically different from that today. Yet, owing to a lack of observational evidence on seasonal and interannual SST variability from crucial low-latitude sites, this fundamental climate characteristic of the PWP remains controversial(1,3-10). Here we show that permanent El Nino conditions did not exist during the PWP. Our spectral analysis of the delta(18)O SST and salinity proxy, extracted from two 35-year, monthly resolved PWP Porites corals in the Philippines, reveals variability that is similar to present ENSO variation. Although our fossil corals cannot be directly compared with modern ENSO records, two lines of evidence suggest that Philippine corals are appropriate ENSO proxies. First, delta(18)O anomalies from a nearby live Porites coral are correlated with modern records of ENSO variability. Second, negative-delta(18)O events in the fossil corals closely resemble the decreases in delta(18)O seen in the live coral during El Nino events. Prior research advocating a permanent El Nino state may have been limited by the coarse resolution of many SST proxies, whereas our coral-based analysis identifies climate variability at the temporal scale required to resolve ENSO structure firmly.","Watanabe, Tsuyoshi; Suzuki, Atsushi; Minobe, Shoshiro; Kawashima, Tatsunori; Kameo, Koji; Minoshima, Kayo; Aguilar, Yolanda M.; Wani, Ryoji; Kawahata, Hodaka; Sowa, Kohki; Nagai, Takaya; Kase, Tomoki","Watanabe, T; Suzuki, A; Minobe, S; Kawashima, T; Kameo, K; Minoshima, K; Aguilar, YM; Wani, R; Kawahata, H; Sowa, K; Nagai, T; Kase, T",209,"[Watanabe, Tsuyoshi; Minobe, Shoshiro; Kawashima, Tatsunori; Sowa, Kohki; Nagai, Takaya] Hokkaido Univ, Dept Nat Hist Sci, Fac Sci, Sapporo, Hokkaido 0600810, Japan; [Suzuki, Atsushi; Minoshima, Kayo] Natl Inst Adv Ind Sci & Technol, Geol Survey Japan, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058567, Japan; [Kameo, Koji] Chiba Univ, Dept Earth Sci, Fac Sci, Chiba 2638522, Japan; [Aguilar, Yolanda M.] Mines & Geosci Bur, Petrolab, Quezon City 1101, Philippines; [Wani, Ryoji] Yokohama Natl Univ, Interdisciplinary Res Ctr, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2408501, Japan; [Kawahata, Hodaka] Univ Tokyo, Atmosphere & Ocean Res Inst, Kashiwa, Chiba 2775564, Japan; [Kase, Tomoki] Natl Museum Nat & Sci, Dept Geol & Paleontol, Tokyo 1690073, Japan",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature09777,Article,,nabe@mail.sci.hokudai.ac.jp,211,,,732FK,,,SEA-SURFACE TEMPERATURE; SOUTHERN-OSCILLATION; TROPICAL PACIFIC; CLIMATE; VARIABILITY; PRECIPITATION; PATTERNS; EPOCH,7337,NATURE,Nature,English,23,No,"Minobe, Shoshiro/0000-0002-9487-9006; KAWAHATA, HODAKA/0000-0003-4236-7356; Wani, Ryoji/0000-0002-3733-769X","MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",10-Mar,3,LONDON,21390128.0,J,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2011,"Watanabe, Tsuyoshi/A-5741-2012; Minobe, Shoshiro/E-2997-2010; Nagai, Takaya/C-3428-2011; Minoshima, Kaoru/G-1435-2013; kohki, sowa/D-2955-2011; KAWAHATA, HODAKA/F-9065-2016","Watanabe, T (reprint author), Hokkaido Univ, Dept Nat Hist Sci, Fac Sci, Sapporo, Hokkaido 0600810, Japan.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,0028-0836,NATURE,60,Permanent El Nino during the Pliocene warm period not supported by coral evidence,2,51,WOS:000288170200035,0,471,Multidisciplinary Sciences,62,tomoki,kase,1578,4,male,0,0,na,na,na,0,0,na,1.0,2,"(1474, 4126]",hWANX-AAAAAJ
33,"Urothelial carcinoma of the bladder is a common malignancy that causes approximately 150,000 deaths per year worldwide. So far, no molecularly targeted agents have been approved for treatment of the disease. As part of The Cancer Genome Atlas project, we report here an integrated analysis of 131 urothelial carcinomasto provide a comprehensive landscape of molecular alterations. There were statistically significant recurrent mutations in 32 genes, including multiple genes involved in cell-cycle regulation, chromatin regulation, and kinase signalling pathways, as well as 9 genes not previously reported as significantly mutated in any cancer. RNA sequencing revealed four expression subtypes, two of which (papillary-like and basal/squamous-like) were also evident in microRNA sequencing and protein data. Whole-genome and RNA sequencing identified recurrent in-frame activating FGFR3-TACC3 fusions and expression or integration of several viruses (including HPV16) that are associated with gene inactivation. Our analyses identified potential therapeutic targets in 69% of the tumours, including 42% with targets in the phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase/AKT/mTOR pathway and 45% with targets (including ERBB2) in the RTK/MAPK pathway. Chromatin regulatory genes were more frequently mutated in urothelial carcinoma than in any other common cancer studied so far, indicating the future possibility of targeted therapy for chromatin abnormalities.","Weinstein, John N.; Akbani, Rehan; Broom, Bradley M.; Wang, Wenyi; Verhaak, Roeland G.

34,"Human language, as well as birdsong, relies on the ability to arrange vocal elements in new sequences. However, little is known about the ontogenetic origin of this capacity. Here we track the development of vocal combinatorial capacity in three species of vocal learners, combining an experimental approach in zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata) with an analysis of natural development of vocal transitions in Bengalese finches (Lonchura striata domestica) and pre-lingual human infants. We find a common, stepwise pattern of acquiring vocal transitions across species. In our first study, juvenile zebra finches were trained to perform one song and then the training target was altered, prompting the birds to swap syllable order, or insert a new syllable into a string. All birds solved these permutation tasks in a series of steps, gradually approximating the target sequence by acquiring new pairwise syllable transitions, sometimes too slowly to accomplish the task fully. Similarly, in the more complex songs of Bengalese finches, branching points and bidirectional transitions in song syntax were acquired in a stepwise fashion, starting from a more restrictive set of vocal transitions. The babbling of pre-lingual human infants showed a similar pattern: instead of a single developmental shift from reduplicated to variegated babbling (that is, from repetitive to diverse sequences), we observed multiple shifts, where each new syllable type slowly acquired a diversity of pairwise transitions, asynchronously over development. Collectively, these results point to a common generative process that is conserved across species, suggesting that the long-noted gap between perceptual versus motor combinatorial capabilities in human infants(1) may arise partly from the challenges in constructing new pairwise vocal transitions.","Lipkind, Dina; Marcus, Gary F.; Bemis, Douglas K.; Sasahara, Kazutoshi; Jacoby, Nori; Takahasi, Miki; Suzuki, Kenta; Feher, Olga; Ravbar, Primoz; Okanoya, Kazuo; Tchernichovski, Ofer","Lipkind, D; Marcus, GF; Bemis, DK; Sasahara, K; Jacoby, N; Takahasi, M; Suzuki, K; Feher, O; Ravbar, P; Okanoya, K; Tchernichovski, O",104,"[Lipkind, Dina; Feher, Olga; Tchernichovski, Ofer] CUNY Hunter Coll, Dept Psychol, New York, NY 10065 USA; [Lipkind, Dina; Feher, Olga; Ravbar, Primoz; Tchernichovski, Ofer] CUNY City Coll, Dept Biol, New York, NY 10031 USA; [Marcus, Gary F.; Bemis, Douglas K.] NYU, Dept Psychol, New York, NY 10003 USA; [Sasahara, Kazutoshi; Takahasi, Miki; Suzuki, Kenta; Okanoya, Kazuo] RIKEN Brain Sci Inst, Lab Biolinguist, Wako, Saitama 3510198, Japan; [Jacoby, Nori] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Interdisciplinary Ctr Neural Computat, IL-91904 Jerusalem, Israel; [Jacoby, Nori] Bar Ilan Univ, Dept Mus, IL-5290002 Ramat Gan, Israel; [Suzuki, Kenta; Okanoya, Kazuo] JST ERATO Okanoya Emot Informat Project, Wako, Saitama 3510198, Japan; [Feher, Olga; Ravbar, Primoz; Tchernichovski, Ofer] CUNY, Grad Ctr, New York, NY 10016 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature12173,Article,,dina.lipkind@gmail.com,+,"Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT), Japan; US Public Health Service grant","We thank J.

35,"The discovery of quasicrystals(1)-crystalline structures that show order while lacking periodicity-forced a paradigm shift in crystallography. Initially limited to intermetallic systems(1-4), the observation of quasicrystalline structures has recently expanded to include 'soft' quasicrystals in the fields of colloidal and supermolecular chemistry(5-9). Here we report an aperiodic oxide that grows as a two-dimensional quasicrystal on a periodic single-element substrate. On a Pt(111) substrate with 3-fold symmetry, the perovskite barium titanate BaTiO3 forms a high-temperature interface-driven structure with 12-fold symmetry. The building blocks of this dodecagonal structure assemble with the theoretically predicted Stampfli-Gahler tiling(10,11) having a fundamental length-scale of 0.69 nm. This example of interface-driven formation of ultrathin quasicrystals from a typical periodic perovskite oxide potentially extends the quasicrystal concept to a broader range of materials. In addition, it demonstrates that frustration at the interface between two periodic materials can drive a thin film into an aperiodic quasicrystalline phase, as proposed previously(12). Such structures might also find use as ultrathin buffer layers for the accommodation of large lattice mismatches in conventional epitaxy(13).","Foerster, Stefan; Meinel, Klaus; Hammer, Rene; Trautmann, Martin; Widdra, Wolf","Forster, S; Meinel, K; Hammer, R; Trautmann, M; Widdra, W",215,"[Foerster, Stefan; Meinel, Klaus; Hammer, Rene; Trautmann, Martin; Widdra, Wolf] Univ Halle Wittenberg, Inst Phys, D-06120 Halle, Germany; [Widdra, Wolf] Max Planck Inst Mikrostrukturphys, D-06120 Halle, Germany",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature12514,Article,1476-4687,wolf.widdra@physik.uni-halle.de,+,Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft [Sonderforschungsbereich 762],"We thank P.

36,"The extinction rate of populations is predicted to rise under increasing rates of environmental change(1-3). If a population experiencing increasingly stressful conditions lacks appropriate phenotypic plasticity or access to more suitable habitats, then genetic change may be the only way to avoid extinction(1). Evolutionary rescue from extinction occurs when natural selection enriches a population for more stress-tolerant genetic variants(1,3). Some experimental studies have shown that lower rates of environmental change lead to more adapted populations or fewer extinctions(4-9). However, there has been little focus on the genetic changes that underlie evolutionary rescue. Here we demonstrate that some evolutionary trajectories are contingent on a lower rate of environmental change. We allowed hundreds of populations of Escherichia coli to evolve under variable rates of increase in concentration of the antibiotic rifampicin. We then genetically engineered all combinations of mutations from isolates evolved under lower rates of environmental change. By assessing fitness of these engineered strains across a range of drug concentrations, we show that certain genotypes are evolutionarily inaccessible under rapid environmental change. Rapidly deteriorating environments not only limit mutational opportunities by lowering population size, but they can also eliminate sets of mutations as evolutionary options. As anthropogenic activities are leading to environmental change at unprecedented rapidity(1), it is critical to understand how the rate of environmental change affects both demographic and genetic underpinnings of evolutionary rescue.","Lindsey, Haley A.; Gallie, Jenna; Taylor, Susan; Kerr, Benjamin","Lindsey, HA; Gallie, J; Taylor, S; Kerr, B",463,"[Lindsey, Haley A.; Gallie, Jenna; Taylor, Susan; Kerr, Benjamin] Univ Washington, Dept Biol, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Lindsey, Haley A.; Gallie, Jenna; Taylor, Susan; Kerr, Benjamin] Univ Washington, BEACON Ctr Study Evolut Act, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Gallie, Jenna] Eawag, Dept Environm Microbiol, CH-8600 Dubendorf, Switzerland; [Gallie, Jenna] ETH, Dept Environm Syst Sci, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature11879,Article,1476-4687,kerrb@uw.edu,467,National Science Foundation [DBI-0939454]; NSF CAREER [DEB0952825]; UW Royalty Research Fund [A74107],"We thank T.

37,"Lysosomes are the stomachs of the cell - terminal organelles on the endocytic pathway where internalized macromolecules are degraded. Containing a wide range of hydrolytic enzymes, lysosomes depend on maintaining acidic luminal pH values for efficient function. Although acidification is mediated by a V- type proton ATPase, a parallel anion pathway is essential to allow bulk proton transport(1,2). The molecular identity of this anion transporter remains unknown. Recent results of knockout experiments raise the possibility that ClC- 7, a member of the CLC family of anion channels and transporters, is a contributor to this pathway in an osteoclast lysosome- like compartment, with loss of ClC- 7 function causing osteopetrosis(3). Several mammalian members of the CLC family have been characterized in detail; some ( including ClC- 0, ClC- 1 and ClC- 2) function as Cl(-) -conducting ion channels(4), whereas others act as Cl(-)/H(+) antiporters ( ClC- 4 and ClC-5) (5,6). However, previous attempts at heterologous expression of ClC- 7 have failed to yield evidence of functional protein, so it is unclear whether ClC- 7 has an important function in lysosomal biology, and also whether this protein functions as a Cl(-) channel, a Cl(-)/H(+) antiporter, or as something else entirely. Here we directly demonstrate an anion transport pathway in lysosomes that has the defining characteristics of a CLC Cl(-)/H(+) antiporter and show that this transporter is the predominant route for Cl(-) through the lysosomal membrane. Furthermore, knockdown of ClC- 7 expression by short interfering RNA can essentially ablate this lysosomal Cl(-)/H(+) antiport activity and can strongly diminish the ability of lysosomes to acidify in vivo, demonstrating that ClC- 7 is a Cl(-)/H(+) antiporter, that it constitutes the major Cl(-) permeability of lysosomes, and that it is important in lysosomal acidification.","Graves, Austin R.; Curran, Patricia K.; Smith, Carolyn L.; Mindell, Joseph A.","Graves, AR; Curran, PK; Smith, CL; Mindell, JA",788,"[Graves, Austin R.; Curran, Patricia K.; Mindell, Joseph A.] Natl Inst Neurol Disorders & Stroke, Membrane Transport Biophys Unit, Porter Neurosci Res Ctr, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Smith, Carolyn L.] Natl Inst Neurol Disorders & Stroke, Light Microscopy Facil, Porter Neurosci Res Ctr, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature06907,Article,,mindellj@ninds.nih.gov,792,Intramural NIH HHS,,308UK,,,OSTEOPETROSIS TYPE-II; FUNCTIONAL RECONSTITUTION; TORPEDO-CALIFORNICA; PROTON PUMP; CHANNEL; PROTEINS; MUTATION; DISEASE; LEADS,7196,NATURE,Nature,English,22,No,"Mindell, Joseph/0000-0002-6952-8247","MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",5-Jun,5,LONDON,18449189.0,J,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2008,"Mindell, Joseph/P-4461-2017","Mindell, JA (reprint author), Natl Inst Neurol Disorders & Stroke, Membrane Transport Biophys Unit, Porter Neurosci Res Ctr, NIH, 35 Convent Dr,Bldg 35,MSC 3701, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,0028-0836,NATURE,171,The Cl(-)/H(+) antiporter ClC-7 is the primary chloride permeation pathway in lysosomes,3,15,WOS:000256415300045,279,453,Multidisciplinary Sciences,181,joseph a.,mindell,2978,3,male,1,1,4477384,4477384,Neognathae,0,0,Neognathae,1.0,2,"(1474, 4126]",fCKd4ikAAAAJ

39,"The upper atmosphere of a planet is a transition region in which energy is transferred between the deeper atmosphere and outer space. Molecular emissions from the upper atmosphere (90-120 km altitude) of Venus can be used to investigate the energetics and to trace the circulation of this hitherto little-studied region. Previous spacecraft(1) and ground-based(2-4) observations of infrared emission from CO2, O-2 and NO have established that photochemical and dynamic activity controls the structure of the upper atmosphere of Venus. These data, however, have left unresolved the precise altitude of the emission(1) owing to a lack of data and of an adequate observing geometry(5,6). Here we report measurements of day-side CO2 non-local thermodynamic equilibrium emission at 4.3 mu m, extending from 90 to 120 km altitude, and of night-side O-2 emission extending from 95 to 100 km. The CO2 emission peak occurs at similar to 115 km and varies with solar zenith angle over a range of similar to 10 km. This confirms previous modelling(7), and permits the beginning of a systematic study of the variability of the emission. The O-2 peak emission happens at 96 km +/- 1 km, which is consistent with three-body recombination of oxygen atoms transported from the day side by a global thermospheric sub-solar to anti-solar circulation, as previously predicted(8).","Drossart, P.; Piccioni, G.; Gerard, J.

40,"Superfluidity - liquid flow without friction - is familiar in helium. The first evidence for 'supersolidity', its analogue in quantum solids, came from torsional oscillator measurements(1,2) involving He-4. At temperatures below 200 mK, the torsional oscillator frequencies increased, suggesting that some of the solid decoupled from the oscillator. This behaviour has been replicated by several groups(3-7), but solid He-4 does not respond to pressure differences(8), and persistent currents and other signatures of superflow have not been seen. Both experiments and theory(9-14) indicate that defects are involved; these should also affect the solid's mechanical behaviour. Here we report a measurement of the shear modulus of solid He-4 at low frequencies and strains. We observe large increases below 200 mK, with the same dependence on measurement amplitude, He-3 impurity concentration and annealing as the decoupling seen in the torsional oscillator experiments. We explain this unusual elastic behaviour in terms of a dislocation network that is pinned by He-3 at the lowest temperatures but becomes mobile above 100 mK. The frequency changes in the torsional oscillator experiments appear to be related to the motion of these dislocations, perhaps by disrupting a possible supersolid state.","Day, James; Beamish, John","Day, J; Beamish, J",853,"Univ Alberta, Dept Phys, Edmonton, AB T6G 2G7, Canada",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature06383,Article,,beamish@phys.ualberta.ca,856,,,237RU,Y,N,HCP HE-4; SOUND-VELOCITY; BCC HE-3; DISLOCATIONS; IMPURITIES; CRYSTALS; HELIUM,7171,NATURE,Nature,English,30,No,"Day, James/0000-0003-4324-3486","MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",6-Dec,4,LONDON,18064007.0,J,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2007,,"Beamish, J (reprint author), Univ Alberta, Dept Phys, Edmonton, AB T6G 2G7, Canada.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,0028-0836,NATURE,224,Low-temperature shear modulus changes in solid He-4 and connection to supersolidity,1,23,WOS:000251394900050,193,450,Multidisciplinary Sciences,224,john,beamish,2260,9931,male,1,1,604590,604590,Beamish Museum,1,1,Beamish Museum,0.99,2,"(1474, 4126]",INKXvRsAAAAJ

42,"Reprogramming of adult cells to generate induced pluripotent stem cells (iPS cells) has opened new therapeutic opportunities; however, little is known about the possibility of in vivo reprogramming within tissues. Here we show that transitory induction of the four factors Oct4, Sox2, Klf4 and c-Myc in mice results in teratomas emerging from multiple organs, implying that full reprogramming can occur in vivo. Analyses of the stomach, intestine, pancreas and kidney reveal groups of dedifferentiated cells that express the pluripotency marker NANOG, indicative of in situ reprogramming. By bone marrow transplantation, we demonstrate that haematopoietic cells can also be reprogrammed in vivo. Notably, reprogrammable mice present circulating iPS cells in the blood and, at the transcriptome level, these in vivo generated iPS cells are closer to embryonic stem cells (ES cells) than standard in vitro generated iPS cells. Moreover, in vivo iPS cells efficiently contribute to the trophectoderm lineage, suggesting that they achieve a more plastic or primitive state than ES cells. Finally, intraperitoneal injection of in vivo iPS cells generates embryo-like structures that express embryonic and extraembryonic markers. We conclude that reprogramming in vivo is feasible and confers totipotency features absent in standard iPS or ES cells. These discoveries could be relevant for future applications of reprogramming in regenerative medicine.","Abad, Maria; Mosteiro, Lluc; Pantoja, Cristina; Canamero, Marta; Rayon, Teresa; Ors, Inmaculada; Grana, Osvaldo; Megias, Diego; Dominguez, Orlando; Martinez, Dolores; Manzanares, Miguel; Ortega, Sagrario; Serrano, Manuel","Abad, M; Mosteiro, L; Pantoja, C; Canamero, M; Rayon, T; Ors, I; Grana, O; Megias, D; Dominguez, O; Martinez, D; Manzanares, M; Ortega, S; Serrano, M",340,"[Abad, Maria; Mosteiro, Lluc; Pantoja, Cristina; Serrano, Manuel] Spanish Natl Canc Res Ctr CNIO, Tumour Suppress Grp, E-28029 Madrid, Spain; [Canamero, Marta] Spanish Natl Canc Res Ctr CNIO, Histopathol Unit, E-28029 Madrid, Spain; [Rayon, Teresa; Ors, Inmaculada; Manzanares, Miguel] Spanish Natl Cardiovasc Res Ctr CNIC, Cardiovasc Dev & Repair Dept, E-28029 Madrid, Spain; [Grana, Osvaldo] Spanish Natl Canc Res Ctr CNIO, Bioinformat Unit, E-28029 Madrid, Spain; [Megias, Diego] Spanish Natl Canc Res Ctr CNIO, Confocal Microscopy Unit, E-28029 Madrid, Spain; [Dominguez, Orlando] Spanish Natl Canc Res Ctr CNIO, Genom Unit, E-28029 Madrid, Spain; [Martinez, Dolores] Spanish Natl Canc Res Ctr CNIO, Flow Cytometry Unit, E-28029 Madrid, Spain; [Ortega, Sagrario] Spanish Natl Canc Res Ctr CNIO, Transgen Mice Unit, E-28029 Madrid, Spain",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature12586,Article,1476-4687,mserrano@cnio.es,+,"CNIO; Spanish Ministry of Economy (MINECO, SAF); Regional Government of Madrid (ReCaRe); European Union (RISK-IR); Botin Foundation; Ramon Areces Foundation; AXA Foundation; MINECO(BFU); Regional Government of Madrid (Cell-DD); ProCNIC Foundation","We are grateful to M.

43,"Sex determination is a fundamental biological process, yet its mechanisms are remarkably diverse(1,2). In vertebrates, sex can be determined by inherited genetic factors or by the temperature experienced during embryonic development(2,3). However, the evolutionary causes of this diversity remain unknown. Here we show that live-bearing lizards at different climatic extremes of the species' distribution differ in their sex-determining mechanisms, with temperature-dependent sex determination in lowlands and genotypic sex determination in highlands. A theoretical model parameterized with field data accurately predicts this divergence in sex-determining systems and the consequence thereof for variation in cohort sex ratios among years. Furthermore, we show that divergent natural selection on sex determination across altitudes is caused by climatic effects on lizard life history and variation in the magnitude of between-year temperature fluctuations. Our results establish an adaptive explanation for intra-specific divergence in sex-determining systems driven by phenotypic plasticity and ecological selection, thereby providing a unifying framework for integrating the developmental, ecological and evolutionary basis for variation in vertebrate sex determination.","Pen, Ido; Uller, Tobias; Feldmeyer, Barbara; Harts, Anna; While, Geoffrey M.; Wapstra, Erik","Pen, I; Uller, T; Feldmeyer, B; Harts, A; While, GM; Wapstra, E",436,"[Pen, Ido; Feldmeyer, Barbara; Harts, Anna] Univ Groningen, Theoret Biol Grp, NL-9750 AA Haren, Netherlands; [Uller, Tobias] Univ Oxford, Dept Zool, Edward Grey Inst, Oxford OX1 3PS, England; [While, Geoffrey M.; Wapstra, Erik] Univ Tasmania, Sch Zool, Hobart, Tas 7001, Australia",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature09512,Article,,i.r.pen@rug.nl,U262,Australian Research Council [DP0877948]; Hermon Slade Foundation; Wenner-Gren Foundations,"Funding was provided by the Australian Research Council to E.W., T.U. and I.P.

44,"Knowledge of the early evolution of fish largely depends on soft-bodied material from the Lower (Series 2) Cambrian period of South China(1,2). Owing to the rarity of some of these forms and a general lack of comparative material from other deposits, interpretations of various features remain controversial(3,4), as do their wider relationships amongst post-Cambrian early un-skeletonized jawless vertebrates. Here we redescribe Metaspriggina(5) on the basis of new material from the Burgess Shale and exceptionally preserved material collected near Marble Canyon, British Columbia(6), and three other Cambrian Burgess Shale-type deposits from Laurentia. This primitive fish displays unambiguous vertebrate features: a notochord, a pair of prominent camera-type eyes, paired nasal sacs, possible cranium and arcualia, W-shaped myomeres, and a post-anal tail. A striking feature is the branchial area with an array of bipartite bars. Apart from the anterior most bar, which appears to be slightly thicker, each is associated with externally located gills, possibly housed in pouches. Phylogenetic analysis places Metaspriggina as a basal vertebrate, apparently close to the Chengjiang taxa Haikouichthys(1-4) and Myllokunmingia(1), demonstrating also that this primitive group of fish was cosmopolitan during Lower-Middle Cambrian times (Series 2-3). However, the arrangement of the branchial region in Metaspriggina has wider implications for reconstructing the morphology of the primitive vertebrate. Each bipartite bar is identified as being respectively equivalent to an epibranchial and ceratobranchial. This configuration suggests that a bipartite arrangement is primitive and reinforces the view that the branchial basket of lampreys(7) is probably derived. Other features of Metaspriggina, including the external position of the gills and possible absence of a gill opposite the more robust anterior-most bar, are characteristic of gnathostomes(8) and so may be primitive within vertebrates.","Morris, Simon Conway; Caron, Jean-Bernard","Morris, SC; Caron, JB",419,"[Morris, Simon Conway] Univ Cambridge, Dept Earth Sci, Cambridge CB2 3EQ, England; [Caron, Jean-Bernard] Royal Ontario Museum, Dept Nat Hist Palaeobiol, Toronto, ON M5S 2C6, Canada; [Caron, Jean-Bernard] Univ Toronto, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Toronto, ON M5S 3B2, Canada",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature13414,Article,1476-4687,sc113@cam.ac.uk; jcaron@rom.on.ca,U413,"Department of Earth Sciences and St John's College, Cambridge; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council [341944]; Royal Ontario Museum [53]","We thank T.

45,"The conserved Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) generates trimethylation of histone 3 lysine 27 (H3K27me3)(1,2), a modification associated with stable epigenetic silencing(3,4). Much is known about PRC2-induced silencing but key questions remain concerning its nucleation and stability. Vernalization, the perception and memory of winter in plants, is a classic epigenetic process that, in Arabidopsis, involves PRC2-based silencing of the floral repressor FLC(5,6). The slow dynamics of vernalization, taking place over weeks in the cold, generate a level of stable silencing of FLC in the subsequent warm that depends quantitatively on the length of the prior cold. These features make vernalization an ideal experimental system to investigate both the maintenance of epigenetic states and the switching between them. Here, using mathematical modelling, chromatin immunoprecipitation and an FLC:GUS reporter assay, we show that the quantitative nature of vernalization is generated by H3K27me3-mediated FLC silencing in the warm in a subpopulation of cells whose number depends on the length of the prior cold. During the cold, H3K27me3 levels progressively increase at a tightly localized nucleation region within FLC. At the end of the cold, numerical simulations predict that such a nucleation region is capable of switching the bistable epigenetic state of an individual locus, with the probability of overall FLC coverage by silencing H3K27me3 marks depending on the length of cold exposure. Thus, the model predicts a bistable pattern of FLC gene expression in individual cells, a prediction we verify using the FLC: GUS reporter system. Our proposed switching mechanism, involving the local nucleation of an opposing histone modification, is likely to be widely relevant in epigenetic reprogramming.","Angel, Andrew; Song, Jie; Dean, Caroline; Howard, Martin","Angel, A; Song, J; Dean, C; Howard, M",105,"[Song, Jie; Dean, Caroline] John Innes Ctr, Dept Cell & Dev Biol, Norwich NR4 7UH, Norfolk, England; [Angel, Andrew; Howard, Martin] John Innes Ctr, Dept Computat & Syst Biol, Norwich NR4 7UH, Norfolk, England",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature10241,Article,,caroline.dean@jic.ac.uk; martin.howard@jic.ac.uk,+,European Research Council; Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council; Royal Society,"We thank all members of the C.

46,"Radiative transfer of energy at the nanometre length scale is of great importance to a variety of technologies including heat-assisted magnetic recording(1), near-field thermophotovoltaics(2) and lithography(3). Although experimental advances have enabled elucidation of near-field radiative heat transfer in gaps as small as 20-30 nanometres (refs 4-6), quantitative analysis in the extreme near field (less than 10 nanometres) has been greatly limited by experimental challenges. Moreover, the results of pioneering measurements(7,8) differed from theoretical predictions by orders of magnitude. Here we use custom-fabricated scanning probes with embedded thermocouples(9,10), in conjunction with new microdevices capable of periodic temperature modulation, to measure radiative heat transfer down to gaps as small as two nanometres. For our experiments we deposited suitably chosen metal or dielectric layers on the scanning probes and microdevices, enabling direct study of extreme near-field radiation between silica-silica, silicon nitride-silicon nitride and gold-gold surfaces to reveal marked, gap-size-dependent enhancements of radiative heat transfer. Furthermore, our state-of-the-art calculations of radiative heat transfer, performed within the theoretical framework of fluctuational electrodynamics, are in excellent agreement with our experimental results, providing unambiguous evidence that confirms the validity of this theory(11-13) for modelling radiative heat transfer in gaps as small as a few nanometres.

47,"The 'certainty effect'(1,2) is a notable violation of expected utility theory by decision makers(3-6). It shows that people's tendency to select the safer of two prospects increases when this prospect provides a good outcome with certainty ( for example, people prefer a monetary gain of 3 with certainty over 4 with a probability of 0.8, but do not prefer 3 with a probability of 0.25 over 4 with a probability of 0.2). Subsequent work on experience- based decision making in rats(7) extended the certainty effect to other animals, suggesting its generality across different species and different decision- making mechanisms. However, an attempt to replicate this study with human subjects showed a surprising 'reversed certainty effect'(8,9), namely, the tendency to prefer the safer option decreases when this prospect is associated with certainty ( and people now prefer 4 with a probability of 0.8 over 3 with certainty). Here we show that these conflicting results can be explained by perceptual noise and that the certainty effect can be restored experimentally by reducing perceptual accuracy. Using complementary experiments in humans and honeybees ( Apis mellifera), we show that by manipulating perceptual accuracy in experience-based tasks, both the certainty and the reversed certainty effects can be exhibited by humans and other animals: the certainty effect emerges when it is difficult to discriminate between the different rewards, whereas the reversed certainty effect emerges when discrimination is easy. Our results fit a simple process- based model of matching behaviour(10,11), capable of explaining the certainty effect in humans and other animals that make repeated decisions based on experience. This mechanism should probably be distinguished from those involved in the original certainty effect that was exhibited by human subjects in single description- based problems(1,2).","Shafir, Sharoni; Reich, Taly; Tsur, Erez; Erev, Ido; Lotem, Arnon","Shafir, S; Reich, T; Tsur, E; Erev, I; Lotem, A",917,"[Lotem, Arnon] Tel Aviv Univ, Dept Zool, Fac Life Sci, IL-69978 Tel Aviv, Israel; [Shafir, Sharoni; Tsur, Erez] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, B Triwaks Bee Res Ctr, Dept Entomol, Fac Agr Food & Environm Qual Sci, IL-76100 Rehovot, Israel; [Reich, Taly; Erev, Ido] Technion Israel Inst Technol, Max Wertheimer Minerva Ctr Cognit Studies, Fac Ind Engn & Management, IL-32000 Haifa, Israel",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature06841,Article,,erev@techunix.technion.ac.il; lotem@post.tau.ac.il,U51,,,311WV,,,APIS-MELLIFERA; DECISION; CHOICE,7197,NATURE,Nature,English,22,No,"Shafir, Sharoni/0000-0002-9068-1078","MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",12-Jun,5,LONDON,18548069.0,J,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2008,"Shafir, Sharoni/D-9821-2011","Lotem, A (reprint author), Tel Aviv Univ, Dept Zool, Fac Life Sci, IL-69978 Tel Aviv, Israel.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,0028-0836,NATURE,47,Perceptual accuracy and conflicting effects of certainty on risk-taking behaviour,0,29,WOS:000256632000043,260,453,Multidisciplinary Sciences,47,arnon,lotem,2857,8,male,0,0,na,na,na,0,0,na,1.0,2,"(1474, 4126]",BsTOfMUAAAAJ
48,"Over a century of research into the origin of turbulence in wall-bounded shear flows has resulted in a puzzling picture in which turbulence appears in a variety of different states competing with laminar background flow(1-6). At moderate flow speeds, turbulence is confined to localized patches; it is only at higher speeds that the entire flow becomes turbulent. The origin of the different states encountered during this transition, the front dynamics of the turbulent regions and the transformation to full turbulence have yet to be explained. By combining experiments, theory and computer simulations, here we uncover a bifurcation scenario that explains the transformation to fully turbulent pipe flow and describe the front dynamics of the different states encountered in the process. Key to resolving this problem is the interpretation of the flow as a bistable system with nonlinear propagation (advection) of turbulent fronts. These findings bridge the gap between our understanding of the onset of turbulence(7) and fully turbulent flows(8,9).","Barkley, Dwight; Song, Baofang; Mukund, Vasudevan; Lemoult, Gregoire; Avila, Marc; Hof, Bjoern","Barkley, D; Song, BF; Mukund, V; Lemoult, G; Avila, M; Hof, B",550,"[Barkley, Dwight] Univ Warwick, Inst Math, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England; [Song, Baofang; Mukund, Vasudevan; Lemoult, Gregoire; Hof, Bjoern] IST Austria, A-3400 Klosterneuburg, Austria; [Song, Baofang] Max Planck Inst Dynam & Self Org, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany; [Song, Baofang] Univ Erlangen Nurnberg, Inst Multiscale Simulat, D-91052 Erlangen, Germany; [Avila, Marc] Univ Erlangen Nurnberg, Inst Fluid Mech, D-91058 Erlangen, Germany",,,11/19/17,,10.1038/nature15701,Article,1476-4687,D.Barkley@warwick.ac.uk; bhof@ist.ac.at,U191,Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft [FOR 1182]; European Research Council under the European Union [306589]; Chinese State Scholarship Fund [2010629145]; International Max Planck Research School for the Physics of Biological and Complex Systems; Gottingen Graduate School for Neurosciences and Molecular Biosciences; Julich Supercomputing Centre [HGU16],"We thank A.

49,"Tropical mountains are hot spots of biodiversity and endemism(1-3), but the evolutionary origins of their unique biotas are poorly understood(4). In varying degrees, local and regional extinction, long-distance colonization, and local recruitment may all contribute to the exceptional character of these communities(5). Also, it is debated whether mountain endemics mostly originate from local lowland taxa, or from lineages that reach the mountain by long-range dispersal from cool localities elsewhere(6). Here we investigate the evolutionary routes to endemism by sampling an entire tropical mountain biota on the 4,095-metre-high Mount Kinabalu in Sabah, East Malaysia. We discover that most of its unique biodiversity is younger than the mountain itself (6 million years), and comprises a mix of immigrant pre-adapted lineages and descendants from local lowland ancestors, although substantial shifts from lower to higher vegetation zones in this latter group were rare. These insights could improve forecasts of the likelihood of extinction and 'evolutionary rescue'(7) in montane biodiversity hot spots under climate change scenarios.","Merckx, Vincent S. F.

50,"The altered activity of the fructose transporter GLUT5, an isoform of the facilitated-diffusion glucose transporter family, has been linked to disorders such as type 2 diabetes and obesity. GLUT5 is also overexpressed in certain tumour cells, and inhibitors are potential drugs for these conditions. Here we describe the crystal structures of GLUT5 from Rattus norvegicus and Bos taurus in open outward-and open inward-facing conformations, respectively. GLUT5 has a major facilitator superfamily fold like other homologous monosaccharide transporters. On the basis of a comparison of the inward-facing structures of GLUT5 and human GLUT1, a ubiquitous glucose transporter, we show that a single point mutation is enough to switch the substrate-binding preference of GLUT5 from fructose to glucose. A comparison of the substrate-free structures of GLUT5 with occluded substrate-bound structures of Escherichia coli XylE suggests that, in addition to global rocker-switch-like re-orientation of the bundles, local asymmetric rearrangements of carboxy-terminal transmembrane bundle helices TM7 and TM10 underlie a 'gated-pore' transport mechanism in such monosaccharide transporters.","Nomura, Norimichi; Verdon, Gregory; Kang, Hae Joo; Shimamura, Tatsuro; Nomura, Yayoi; Sonoda, Yo; Hussien, Saba Abdul; Qureshi, Aziz Abdul; Coincon, Mathieu; Sato, Yumi; Abe, Hitomi; Nakada-Nakura, Yoshiko; Hino, Tomoya; Arakawa, Takatoshi; Kusano-Arai, Osamu; Iwanari, Hiroko; Murata, Takeshi; Kobayashi, Takuya; Hamakubo, Takao; Kasahara, Michihiro; Iwata, So; Drew, David","Nomura, N; Verdon, G; Kang, HJ; Shimamura, T; Nomura, Y; Sonoda, Y; Hussien, SA; Qureshi, AA; Coincon, M; Sato, Y; Abe, H; Nakada-Nakura, Y; Hino, T; Arakawa, T; Kusano-Arai, O; Iwanari, H; Murata, T; Kobayashi, T; Hamakubo, T; Kasahara, M; Iwata, S; Drew, D",397,"[Nomura, Norimichi; Shimamura, Tatsuro; Nomura, Yayoi; Sato, Yumi; Abe, Hitomi; Nakada-Nakura, Yoshiko; Hino, Tomoya; Arakawa, Takatoshi; Murata, Takeshi; Kobayashi, Takuya; Iwata, So] Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Med, Dept Cell Biol, Sakyo Ku, Kyoto 6068501, Japan; [Nomura, Norimichi; Shimamura, Tatsuro; Nomura, Yayoi; Hino, Tomoya; Arakawa, Takatoshi; Murata, Takeshi; Kobayashi, Takuya; Iwata, So] Japan Sci & Technol Agcy, ERATO, Iwata Human Receptor Crystallog Project, Sakyo Ku, Kyoto 6068501, Japan; [Nomura, Norimichi; Shimamura, Tatsuro; Nomura, Yayoi; Nakada-Nakura, Yoshiko; Murata, Takeshi; Kobayashi, Takuya; Iwata, So] Japan Sci & Technol Agcy, Res Accelerat Program, Membrane Prot Crystallog Project, Sakyo Ku, Kyoto 6068501, Japan; [Verdon, Gregory; Kang, Hae Joo; Sonoda, Yo; Iwata, So; Drew, David] Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Div Mol Biosci, London SW7 2AZ, England; [Verdon, Gregory; Kang, Hae Joo; Iwata, So] Diamond Light Source, Membrane Prot Lab, Chilton OX11 0DE, Oxon, England; [Verdon, Gregory; Kang, Hae Joo; Iwata, So] Rutherford Appleton Lab, Res Complex Harwell, Didcot OX11 0FA, Oxon, England; [Hussien, Saba Abdul; Qureshi, Aziz Abdul; Coincon, Mathieu; Drew, David] Stockholm Univ, Dept Biochem & Biophys, Ctr Biomembrane Res, SE-10691 Stockholm, Sweden; [Kusano-Arai, Osamu; Hamakubo, Takao] Univ Tokyo, Dept Quantitat Biol & Med, Res Ctr Adv Sci & Technol, Meguro Ku, Tokyo 1538904, Japan; [Murata, Takeshi; Iwata, So] RIKEN, Syst & Struct Biol Ctr, Tsurumi Ku, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2300045, Japan; [Kasahara, Michihiro] Teikyo Univ, Sch Med, Biophys Lab, Hachioji, Tokyo 1920395, Japan",,,11/19/17,,10.1038/nature14909,Article,1476-4687,nnomura@mfour.med.kyoto-u.ac.jp; s.iwata@mfour.med.kyoto-u.ac.jp; ddrew@dbb.su.se,+,"Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation; Royal Society; BBSRC [BB/G02325/1]; ERATO Human Receptor Crystallography Project of the Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST); Research Acceleration Program of the JST; Targeted Proteins Research Program of the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT) of Japan; MEXT [22570114]; MEXT; Wellcome Trust at the Diamond Light Source Limited [062164/Z/00/Z]; Centre for Biomembrane Research (CBR) - Swedish Foundation for Strategic Research; Human Frontiers Postdoctoral fellowship; EMBO through Young Investigator Program (YIP)","We are grateful to D.

51,"Genome sequencing of Helicobacter pylori has revealed the potential proteins and genetic diversity of this prevalent human pathogen, yet little is known about its transcriptional organization and noncoding RNA output. Massively parallel cDNA sequencing (RNA-seq) has been revolutionizing global transcriptomic analysis. Here, using a novel differential approach (dRNA-seq) selective for the 5' end of primary transcripts, we present a genome-wide map of H. pylori transcriptional start sites and operons. We discovered hundreds of transcriptional start sites within operons, and opposite to annotated genes, indicating that complexity of gene expression from the small H. pylori genome is increased by uncoupling of polycistrons and by genome-wide antisense transcription. We also discovered an unexpected number of similar to 60 small RNAs including the e-subdivision counterpart of the regulatory 6S RNA and associated RNA products, and potential regulators of cis- and trans-encoded target messenger RNAs. Our approach establishes a paradigm for mapping and annotating the primary transcriptomes of many living species.","Sharma, Cynthia M.; Hoffmann, Steve; Darfeuille, Fabien; Reignier, Jeremy; Findeiss, Sven; Sittka, Alexandra; Chabas, Sandrine; Reiche, Kristin; Hackermueller, Joerg; Reinhardt, Richard; Stadler, Peter F.; Vogel, Joerg","Sharma, CM; Hoffmann, S; Darfeuille, F; Reignier, J; Findeiss, S; Sittka, A; Chabas, S; Reiche, K; Hackermuller, J; Reinhardt, R; Stadler, PF; Vogel, J",250,"[Sharma, Cynthia M.; Sittka, Alexandra; Vogel, Joerg] Max Planck Inst Infect Biol, RNA Biol Grp, D-10117 Berlin, Germany; [Hoffmann, Steve; Findeiss, Sven; Stadler, Peter F.] Univ Leipzig, Dept Comp Sci, D-04107 Leipzig, Germany; [Hoffmann, Steve; Findeiss, Sven; Stadler, Peter F.] Univ Leipzig, Interdisciplinary Ctr Bioinformat, D-04107 Leipzig, Germany; [Darfeuille, Fabien; Reignier, Jeremy; Chabas, Sandrine] INSERM, U869, F-33076 Bordeaux, France; [Darfeuille, Fabien; Reignier, Jeremy; Chabas, Sandrine] Univ Bordeaux, F-33076 Bordeaux, France; [Reiche, Kristin; Hackermueller, Joerg; Stadler, Peter F.] Fraunhofer Inst Cell Therapy & Immunol, RNom Grp, D-04103 Leipzig, Germany; [Reinhardt, Richard] Max Planck Inst Mol Genet, D-14195 Berlin, Germany; [Stadler, Peter F.] Max Planck Inst Math Sci, D-04103 Leipzig, Germany; [Stadler, Peter F.] Univ Vienna, Inst Theoret Chem, A-1090 Vienna, Austria; [Stadler, Peter F.] Santa Fe Inst, Santa Fe, NM 87501 USA; [Vogel, Joerg] Univ Wurzburg, Inst Mol Infect Biol, D-97080 Wurzburg, Germany",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature08756,Article,,joerg.vogel@uni-wuerzburg.de,255,"NGFN, BMBF, Germany; DFG [SPP1258]; Regulatory RNAs in Prokaryotes [VO8751/2, VO8751/4, STA850/7-1]; University of Leipzig; Freistaat Sachsen; German Research Foundation IZBI [BIZ6/1-4]; Volkswagen Stiftung [I/82 720]; French Agence Nationale de la Recherche [ANR-07-JCJC-0104-01]; French Association de la Recherche contre le Cancer (ARC); La Ligue Nationale contre le Cancer (LNCC)","We thank F.

52,"Apomixis, the formation of asexual seeds in plants, leads to populations that are genetically uniform maternal clones. The transfer of apomixis to crop plants holds great promise in plant breeding for fixation of heterozygosity and hybrid vigour because it would allow the propagation of hybrids over successive generations(1,2). Apomixis involves the production of unreduced ( diploid) female gametes that retain the genotype of the parent plant ( apomeiosis), followed by parthenogenetic development of the egg cell into an embryo and the formation of functional endosperm(3). The molecular mechanisms underlying apomixis are unknown. Here we show that mutation of the Arabidopsis gene DYAD/ SWITCH1 (SWI1)(4,5), a regulator of meiotic chromosome organization, leads to apomeiosis. We found that most fertile ovules in dyad plants form seeds that are triploid and that arise from the fertilization of an unreduced female gamete by a haploid male gamete. The unreduced female gametes fully retain parental heterozygosity across the genome, which is characteristic of apomeiosis. Our results show that the alteration of a single gene in a sexual plant can bring about functional apomeiosis, a major component of apomixis.","Ravi, Maruthachalam; Marimuthu, Mohan P.

53,"DNA damage responses have been well characterized with regard to their cell-autonomous checkpoint functions leading to cell cycle arrest, senescence and apoptosis(1). In contrast, systemic responses to tissue-specific genome instability remain poorly understood. In adult Caenorhabditis elegans worms germ cells undergo mitotic and meiotic cell divisions, whereas somatic tissues are entirely post-mitotic. Consequently, DNA damage checkpoints function specifically in the germ line(2), whereas somatic tissues in adult C. elegans are highly radio-resistant(3). Some DNA repair systems such as global-genome nucleotide excision repair (GG-NER) remove lesions specifically in germ cells(4). Here we investigated how genome instability in germ cells affects somatic tissues in C. elegans. We show that exogenous and endogenous DNA damage in germ cells evokes elevated resistance to heat and oxidative stress. The somatic stress resistance is mediated by the ERK MAP kinase MPK-1 in germ cells that triggers the induction of putative secreted peptides associated with innate immunity. The innate immune response leads to activation of the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) in somatic tissues, which confers enhanced proteostasis and systemic stress resistance. We propose that elevated systemic stress resistance promotes endurance of somatic tissues to allow delay of progeny production when germ cells are genomically compromised.","Ermolaeva, Maria A.; Segref, Alexandra; Dakhovnik, Alexander; Ou, Hui-Ling; Schneider, Jennifer I.; Utermoehlen, Olaf; Hoppe, Thorsten; Schumacher, Bjoern","Ermolaeva, MA; Segref, A; Dakhovnik, A; Ou, HL; Schneider, JI; Utermohlen, O; Hoppe, T; Schumacher, B",416,"[Ermolaeva, Maria A.; Segref, Alexandra; Dakhovnik, Alexander; Ou, Hui-Ling; Schneider, Jennifer I.; Hoppe, Thorsten; Schumacher, Bjoern] Univ Cologne, Inst Genet, Cologne Excellence Cluster Cellular Stress Respon, D-50674 Cologne, Germany; [Utermoehlen, Olaf] Univ Cologne, Med Ctr, Inst Med Microbiol Immunol & Hyg, D-50935 Cologne, Germany; [Utermoehlen, Olaf] Univ Cologne, Ctr Mol Med Cologne CMMC, D-50931 Cologne, Germany; [Schumacher, Bjoern] Univ Cologne, D-50937 Cologne, Germany",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature12452,Article,,bjoern.schumacher@uni-koeln.de,+,"US National Institutes of Health (NIH) Office of Research Infrastructure Programs [P40 OD010440]; Mitani laboratory; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) [SFB 670-TP4]; EC Network of Excellence RUBICON [LSHC-CT-2005-018683]; DFG [CECAD, FOR885, SFB635, KFO286, HO2541/4-1, SFB 829, KFO 286]; European Research Council [260383]; Marie Curie [FP7 ITN CodeAge 316354, aDDRess 316390, MARRIAGE 316964, ERG239330]; German-Israeli Foundation [GIF 2213-1935.13/2008, 1104-68.11/2010]; Deutsche Krebshilfe [109453]; BMBF (SyBaCol)","We thank S.

54,"DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) in repetitive sequences are a potent source of genomic instability, owing to the possibility of non-allelic homologous recombination (NAHR). Repetitive sequences are especially at risk during meiosis, when numerous programmed DSBs are introduced into the genome to initiate meiotic recombination(1). In the repetitive ribosomal DNA (rDNA) array of the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, meiotic DSB formation is prevented in part through Sir2-dependent heterochromatin formation(2,3). Here we show that the edges of the rDNA array are exceptionally susceptible to meiotic DSBs, revealing an inherent heterogeneity in the rDNA array. We find that this localized DSB susceptibility necessitates a border-specific protection system consisting of the meiotic ATPase Pch2 and the origin recognition complex subunit Orc1. Upon disruption of these factors, DSB formation and recombination increased specifically in the outermost rDNA repeats, leading to NAHR and rDNA instability. Notably, the Sir2-dependent heterochromatin of the rDNA itself was responsible for the induction of DSBs at the rDNA borders in pch2 Delta cells. Thus, although the activity of Sir2 globally prevents meiotic DSBs in the rDNA, it creates a highly permissive environment for DSB formation at the junctions between heterochromatin and euchromatin. Heterochromatinized repetitive DNA arrays are abundant in most eukaryotic genomes. Our data define the borders of such chromatin domains as distinct high-risk regions for meiotic NAHR, the protection of which may be a universal requirement to prevent meiotic genome rearrangements that are associated with genomic diseases and birth defects.","Vader, Gerben; Blitzblau, Hannah G.; Tame, Mihoko A.; Falk, Jill E.; Curtin, Lisa; Hochwagen, Andreas","Vader, G; Blitzblau, HG; Tame, MA; Falk, JE; Curtin, L; Hochwagen, A",115,"[Vader, Gerben; Blitzblau, Hannah G.; Tame, Mihoko A.; Falk, Jill E.; Curtin, Lisa; Hochwagen, Andreas] Whitehead Inst Biomed Res, Cambridge Ctr 9, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; [Curtin, Lisa] Somerville High Sch, Somerville, MA 02143 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature10331,Article,,andi@nyu.edu,U141,"NIH [GM088248]; Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research [NWO Rubicon-825.08.009, NWO VENI-016.111.004]; HHMI [52005879]","We thank S.

55,"A fundamental question in neuroscience is how entire neural circuits generate behaviour and adapt it to changes in sensory feedback. Here we use two-photon calcium imaging to record the activity of large populations of neurons at the cellular level, throughout the brain of larval zebrafish expressing a genetically encoded calcium sensor, while the paralysed animals interact fictively with a virtual environment and rapidly adapt their motor output to changes in visual feedback. We decompose the network dynamics involved in adaptive locomotion into four types of neuronal response properties, and provide anatomical maps of the corresponding sites. A subset of these signals occurred during behavioural adjustments and are candidates for the functional elements that drive motor learning. Lesions to the inferior olive indicate a specific functional role for olivocerebellar circuitry in adaptive locomotion. This study enables the analysis of brain-wide dynamics at single-cell resolution during behaviour.","Ahrens, Misha B.; Li, Jennifer M.; Orger, Michael B.; Robson, Drew N.; Schier, Alexander F.; Engert, Florian; Portugues, Ruben","Ahrens, MB; Li, JM; Orger, MB; Robson, DN; Schier, AF; Engert, F; Portugues, R",471,"[Ahrens, Misha B.; Li, Jennifer M.; Robson, Drew N.; Schier, Alexander F.; Engert, Florian; Portugues, Ruben] Harvard Univ, Dept Mol & Cellular Biol, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Ahrens, Misha B.] Univ Cambridge, Dept Engn, Computat & Biol Learning Lab, Cambridge CB2 1PZ, England; [Orger, Michael B.] Champalimaud Ctr Unknown, Champalimaud Neurosci Programme, P-1400038 Lisbon, Portugal",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature11057,Article,,florian@mcb.harvard.edu,U80,"Wellcome Trust; K99 [5K99NS62780-2]; National Institutes of Health [5R01EY014429, RC2NS069407]","We are grateful to D.

56,"The wavefunction is the complex distribution used to completely describe a quantum system, and is central to quantum theory. But despite its fundamental role, it is typically introduced as an abstract element of the theory with no explicit definition(1,2). Rather, physicists come to a working understanding of the wavefunction through its use to calculate measurement outcome probabilities by way of the Born rule(3). At present, the wavefunction is determined through tomographic methods(4-8), which estimate the wavefunction most consistent with a diverse collection of measurements. The indirectness of these methods compounds the problem of defining the wavefunction. Here we show that the wavefunction can be measured directly by the sequential measurement of two complementary variables of the system. The crux of our method is that the first measurement is performed in a gentle way through weak measurement(9-18), so as not to invalidate the second. The result is that the real and imaginary components of the wavefunction appear directly on our measurement apparatus. We give an experimental example by directly measuring the transverse spatial wavefunction of a single photon, a task not previously realized by any method. We show that the concept is universal, being applicable to other degrees of freedom of the photon, such as polarization or frequency, and to other quantum systems-for example, electron spins, SQUIDs (superconducting quantum interference devices) and trapped ions. Consequently, this method gives the wavefunction a straightforward and general definition in terms of a specific set of experimental operations(19). We expect it to expand the range of quantum systems that can be characterized and to initiate new avenues in fundamental quantum theory.","Lundeen, Jeff S.; Sutherland, Brandon; Patel, Aabid; Stewart, Corey; Bamber, Charles","Lundeen, JS; Sutherland, B; Patel, A; Stewart, C; Bamber, C",188,"[Lundeen, Jeff S.; Sutherland, Brandon; Patel, Aabid; Stewart, Corey; Bamber, Charles] CNR, Inst Natl Measurement Stand, Ottawa, ON K1A 0R6, Canada",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature10120,Article,1476-4687,jeff.lundeen@nrc-cnrc.gc.ca,191,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council; Business Development Bank of Canada,This work was supported by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council and the Business Development Bank of Canada.,774PE,Y,N,LINEAR OPTICS; STATES; LIGHT; REALIZATION; SPIN,7350,NATURE,Nature,English,30,No,"Lundeen, Jeff/0000-0002-0978-2913","MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",9-Jun,4,LONDON,21654800.0,J,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2011,"Lundeen, Jeff/E-8512-2012","Lundeen, JS (reprint author), CNR, Inst Natl Measurement Stand, 1200 Montreal Rd, Ottawa, ON K1A 0R6, Canada.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,0028-0836,NATURE,219,Direct measurement of the quantum wavefunction,3,78,WOS:000291397800044,299,474,Multidisciplinary Sciences,220,charles,bamber,2171,1798,male,0,0,na,na,na,0,0,na,1.0,2,"(1474, 4126]",g7ZQe7EAAAAJ
57,"Gamma- ray line radiation at 511 keV is the signature of electron positron annihilation. Such radiation has been known for 30 years to come from the general direction of the Galactic Centre(1), but the origin of the positrons has remained a mystery. Stellar nucleosynthesis(2-4), accreting compact objects(5-8), and even the annihilation of exotic dark- matter particles(9) have all been suggested. Here we report a distinct asymmetry in the 511- keV line emission coming from the inner Galactic disk ( similar to 10-50 degrees from the Galactic Centre). This asymmetry resembles an asymmetry in the distribution of low mass X- ray binaries with strong emission at photon energies >20 keV ('hard' LMXBs), indicating that they may be the dominant origin of the positrons. Although it had long been suspected that electron - positron pair plasmas may exist in X- ray binaries, it was not evident that many of the positrons could escape to lose energy and ultimately annihilate with electrons in the interstellar medium and thus lead to the emission of a narrow 511- keV line. For these models, our result implies that up to a few times 10(41) positrons escape per second from a typical hard LMXB. Positron production at this level from hard LMXBs in the Galactic bulge would reduce ( and possibly eliminate) the need for more exotic explanations, such as those involving dark matter.","Weidenspointner, Georg; Skinner, Gerry; Jean, Pierre; Knoedlseder, Juergen; von Ballmoos, Peter; Bignami, Giovanni; Diehl, Roland; Strong, Andrew W.; Cordier, Bertrand; Schanne, Stephane; Winkler, Christoph","Weidenspointner, G; Skinner, G; Jean, P; Knodlseder, J; von Ballmoos, P; Bignami, G; Diehl, R; Strong, AW; Cordier, B; Schanne, S; Winkler, C",159,"[Weidenspointner, Georg; Skinner, Gerry; Jean, Pierre; Knoedlseder, Juergen; von Ballmoos, Peter; Bignami, Giovanni] UPS, CNRS, Ctr Etud Spatiale Rayonnements, Toulouse 4, France; [Weidenspointner, Georg; Diehl, Roland; Strong, Andrew W.] Max Planck Inst Extraterr Phys, D-85741 Garching, Germany; [Weidenspointner, Georg] MPI Halbleiterlab, D-81739 Munich, Germany; [Skinner, Gerry] NASA, CRESST, Greenbelt, MD 20771 USA; [Skinner, Gerry] NASA, Goddard Space Flight Ctr, Greenbelt, MD 20771 USA; [Skinner, Gerry] Univ Maryland, Dept Astron, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Cordier, Bertrand; Schanne, Stephane] CEA Saclay, SAp, DAPNIA, DSM, F-91191 Gif Sur Yvette, France; [Winkler, Christoph] ESA, ESTEC, SCI SA, NL-2201 AZ Noordwijk, Netherlands; [Bignami, Giovanni] IUSS, I-27100 Pavia, Italy",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature06490,Article,,Georg.Weidenspointner@hll.mpg.de,162,,,249GA,,,ANNIHILATION RADIATION; SKY DISTRIBUTION; INNER GALAXY; BLACK-HOLE; MILKY-WAY; EMISSION; AL-26; SEARCH,7175,NATURE,Nature,English,29,No,"Bignami, Giovanni/0000-0001-9582-2450","MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",10-Jan,4,LONDON,18185581.0,J,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2008,,"Weidenspointner, G (reprint author), UPS, CNRS, Ctr Etud Spatiale Rayonnements, BP 44346, Toulouse 4, France.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,0028-0836,NATURE,127,An asymmetric distribution of positrons in the Galactic disk revealed by gamma-rays,0,4,WOS:000252214400035,117,451,Multidisciplinary Sciences,127,christoph,winkler,3976,192,male,0,0,na,na,na,0,0,na,1.0,2,"(1474, 4126]",HIF10V0AAAAJ
58,"Sensory proteins must relay structural signals from the sensory site over large distances to regulatory output domains. Phytochromes are a major family of red-light-sensing kinases that control diverse cellular functions in plants, bacteria and fungi(1-9). Bacterial phytochromes consist of a photosensory core and a carboxy-terminal regulatory domain(10,11). Structures of photosensory cores are reported in the resting state(12-18) and conformational responses to light activation have been proposed in the vicinity of the chromophore(19-23). However, the structure of the signalling state and the mechanism of downstream signal relay through the photosensory core remain elusive. Here we report crystal and solution structures of the resting and activated states of the photosensory core of the bacteriophytochrome from Deinococcus radiodurans. The structures show an open and closed form of the dimeric protein for the activated and resting states, respectively. This nanometre-scale rearrangement is controlled by refolding of an evolutionarily conserved 'tongue', which is in contact with the chromophore. The findings reveal an unusual mechanism in which atomic-scale conformational changes around the chromophore are first amplified into ana angstrom-scale distance change in the tongue, and further grow into a nanometre-scale conformational signal. The structural mechanism is a blueprint for understanding how phytochromes connect to the cellular signalling network.","Takala, Heikki; Bjorling, Alexander; Berntsson, Oskar; Lehtivuori, Heli; Niebling, Stephan; Hoernke, Maria; Kosheleva, Irina; Henning, Robert; Menzel, Andreas; Ihalainen, Janne A.; Westenhoff, Sebastian","Takala, H; Bjorling, A; Berntsson, O; Lehtivuori, H; Niebling, S; Hoernke, M; Kosheleva, I; Henning, R; Menzel, A; Ihalainen, JA; Westenhoff, S",245,"[Takala, Heikki; Lehtivuori, Heli; Ihalainen, Janne A.] Univ Jyvaskyla, Dept Biol & Environm Sci, Nanosci Ctr, Jyvaskyla 40014, Finland; [Takala, Heikki; Bjorling, Alexander; Berntsson, Oskar; Niebling, Stephan; Hoernke, Maria; Westenhoff, Sebastian] Univ Gothenburg, Dept Chem & Mol Biol, S-40530 Gothenburg, Sweden; [Kosheleva, Irina; Henning, Robert] Univ Chicago, Ctr Adv Radiat Sources, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Menzel, Andreas] Paul Scherrer Inst, CH-5232 Villigen, Switzerland",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature13310,Article,1476-4687,janne.ihalainen@jyu.fi; westenho@chem.gu.se,+,"European Community [312284 CALIPSO]; National Institutes of Health, National Institute of General Medical Sciences [1R24GM111072]; Foundation of Strategic Research, Sweden; Swedish Research Council [279944]; European Research Council [279944]; Finnish Academy [138063]; Finnish Cultural Foundation [0131067]","We acknowledge beamline access at BM29 and ID23-1 at the ESRF, cSAXS at the Swiss Light Source (funded by the European Community's FP7 grant agreement no. 312284 CALIPSO), and BioCARS at the Advanced Photon Source, Argonne National Laboratory (supported by National Institutes of Health, National Institute of General Medical Sciences grant 1R24GM111072 and in part through collaboration with P.

59,"Except for the first 50-100 million years or so of the Earth's history, when most of the mantle may have been subjected to melting, the differentiation of Earth's silicate mantle has been controlled by solid-state convection(1). As the mantle upwells and decompresses across its solidus, it partially melts. These low-density melts rise to the surface and form the continental and oceanic crusts, driving the differentiation of the silicate part of the Earth. Because many trace elements, such as heat-producing U, Th and K, as well as the noble gases, preferentially partition into melts (here referred to as incompatible elements), melt extraction concentrates these elements into the crust (or atmosphere in the case of noble gases), where nearly half of the Earth's budget of these elements now resides(2). In contrast, the upper mantle, as sampled by mid-ocean ridge basalts, is highly depleted in incompatible elements, suggesting a complementary relationship with the crust. Mass balance arguments require that the other half of these incompatible elements be hidden in the Earth's interior. Hypotheses abound for the origin of this hidden reservoir(3-6). The most widely held view has been that this hidden reservoir represents primordial material never processed by melting or degassing. Here, we suggest that a necessary by-product of whole-mantle convection during the Earth's first billion years is deep and hot melting, resulting in the generation of dense liquids that crystallized and sank into the lower mantle. These sunken lithologies would have 'primordial' chemical signatures despite a non-primordial origin.","Lee, Cin-Ty A.; Luffi, Peter; Hoeink, Tobias; Li, Jie; Dasgupta, Rajdeep; Hernlund, John","Lee, CTA; Luffi, P; Hoink, T; Li, J; Dasgupta, R; Hernlund, J",930,"[Lee, Cin-Ty A.; Luffi, Peter; Hoeink, Tobias; Dasgupta, Rajdeep] Rice Univ, Dept Earth Sci, Houston, TX 77005 USA; [Li, Jie] Univ Michigan, Dept Geol Sci, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Hernlund, John] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature08824,Article,,ctlee@rice.edu,U102,Packard Foundation; NSF; University of Illinois,"The ideas for this paper were conceived at Rice University and fine-tuned at the 2008 Cooperative Institute for Deep Earth Research workshop at the Kavli Institute.

60,"The exquisite preservation of soft-bodied animals in Burgess Shale-type deposits provides important clues into the early evolution of body plans that emerged during the Cambrian explosion(1). Until now, such deposits have remained silent regarding the early evolution of extant molluscan lineages-in particular the cephalopods. Nautiloids, traditionally considered basal within the cephalopods, are generally depicted as evolving from a creeping Cambrian ancestor whose dorsal shell afforded protection and buoyancy(2). Although nautiloid-like shells occur from the Late Cambrian onwards, the fossil record provides little constraint on this model, or indeed on the early evolution of cephalopods. Here, we reinterpret the problematic Middle Cambrian animal Nectocaris pteryx(3,4) as a primitive (that is, stem-group), non-mineralized cephalopod, based on new material from the Burgess Shale. Together with Nectocaris, the problematic Lower Cambrian taxa Petalilium(5) and (probably) Vetustovermis(6,7) form a distinctive clade, Nectocarididae, characterized by an open axial cavity with paired gills, wide lateral fins, a single pair of long, prehensile tentacles, a pair of non-faceted eyes on short stalks, and a large, flexible anterior funnel. This clade extends the cephalopods' fossil record(2) by over 30 million years, and indicates that primitive cephalopods lacked a mineralized shell, were hyperbenthic, and were presumably carnivorous. The presence of a funnel suggests that jet propulsion evolved in cephalopods before the acquisition of a shell. The explosive diversification of mineralized cephalopods in the Ordovician may have an understated Cambrian 'fuse'.","Smith, Martin R.; Caron, Jean-Bernard","Smith, MR; Caron, JB",469,"[Smith, Martin R.; Caron, Jean-Bernard] Univ Toronto, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Toronto, ON M5S 3G5, Canada; [Smith, Martin R.; Caron, Jean-Bernard] Royal Ontario Museum, Dept Nat Hist, Toronto, ON M5S 2C6, Canada",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature09068,Article,,jcaron@rom.on.ca,472,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; University of Toronto,"We thank S.

61,"Previous excavations at Mata Menge and Boa Lesa in the Soa Basin of Flores, Indonesia, recovered stone artefacts in association with fossilized remains of the large-bodied Stegodon florensis florensis(1-9). Zircon fission-track ages from these sites indicated that hominins had colonized the island by 0.88 +/- 0.07 million years (Myr) ago(6). Here we describe the contents, context and age of Wolo Sege, a recently discovered archaeological site in the Soa Basin that has in situ stone artefacts and that lies stratigraphically below Mata Menge and immediately above the basement breccias of the basin. We show using Ar-40/Ar-39 dating that an ignimbrite overlying the artefact layers at Wolo Sege was erupted 1.02 +/- 0.02 Myr ago, providing a new minimum age for hominins on Flores. This predates the disappearance from the Soa Basin of 'pygmy' Stegodon sondaari and Geochelone spp. (giant tortoise), as evident at the nearby site of Tangi Talo, which has been dated to 0.90 +/- 0.07 Myr ago(10). It now seems that this extirpation or possible extinction event and the associated faunal turnover were the result of natural processes rather than the arrival of hominins(9). It also appears that the volcanic and fluvio-lacustrine deposits infilling the Soa Basin may not be old enough to register the initial arrival of hominins on the island.","Brumm, Adam; Jensen, Gitte M.; van den Bergh, Gert D.; Morwood, Michael J.; Kurniawan, Iwan; Aziz, Fachroel; Storey, Michael","Brumm, A; Jensen, GM; van den Bergh, GD; Morwood, MJ; Kurniawan, I; Aziz, F; Storey, M",748,"[Jensen, Gitte M.; Storey, Michael] Roskilde Univ, Dept Environm Social & Spatial Change, Quaternary Dating Lab, DK-4000 Roskilde, Denmark; [Brumm, Adam; van den Bergh, Gert D.; Morwood, Michael J.] Univ Wollongong, Sch Earth & Environm Sci, Ctr Archaeol Sci, Wollongong, NSW 2522, Australia; [Kurniawan, Iwan; Aziz, Fachroel] Geol Survey Inst, Bandung 40122, Indonesia; [van den Bergh, Gert D.] Natl Museum Nat Hist, NL-2333 CR Leiden, Netherlands",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature08844,Article,1476-4687,abrumm@uow.edu.au; storey@ruc.dk,U123,"Australian Research Council (ARC); Australian National University; McDonald Institute for Archaeological Research, University of Cambridge; D.

62,"DNA methylation is a heritable epigenetic modification involved in gene silencing, imprinting, and the suppression of retrotransposons(1). Global DNA demethylation occurs in the early embryo and the germ line(2,3), and may be mediated by Tet (ten eleven translocation) enzymes(4-6), which convert 5-methylcytosine (5mC) to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC)(7). Tet enzymes have been studied extensively in mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells(8-12), which are generally cultured in the absence of vitamin C, a potential cofactor for Fe(II) 2-oxoglutarate dioxygenase enzymes such as Tet enzymes. Here we report that addition of vitamin C to mouse ES cells promotes Tet activity, leading to a rapid and global increase in 5hmC. This is followed by DNA demethylation of many gene promoters and upregulation of demethylated germline genes. Tet1 binding is enriched near the transcription start site of genes affected by vitamin C treatment. Importantly, vitamin C, but not other antioxidants, enhances the activity of recombinant Tet1 in a biochemical assay, and the vitamin-C-induced changes in 5hmC and 5mC are entirely suppressed in Tet1 and Tet2 double knockout ES cells. Vitamin C has a stronger effect on regions that gain methylation in cultured ES cells compared to blastocysts, and in vivo are methylated only after implantation. In contrast, imprinted regions and intracisternal A particle retroelements, which are resistant to demethylation in the early embryo(2,13), are resistant to vitamin-C-induced DNA demethylation. Collectively, the results of this study establish vitamin C as a direct regulator of Tet activity and DNA methylation fidelity in ES cells.","Blaschke, Kathryn; Ebata, Kevin T.; Karimi, Mohammad M.; Zepeda-Martinez, Jorge A.; Goyal, Preeti; Mahapatra, Sahasransu; Tam, Angela; Laird, Diana J.; Hirst, Martin; Rao, Anjana; Lorincz, Matthew C.; Ramalho-Santos, Miguel","Blaschke, K; Ebata, KT; Karimi, MM; Zepeda-Martinez, JA; Goyal, P; Mahapatra, S; Tam, A; Laird, DJ; Hirst, M; Rao, A; Lorincz, MC; Ramalho-Santos, M",222,"[Blaschke, Kathryn; Ebata, Kevin T.; Laird, Diana J.; Ramalho-Santos, Miguel] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Obstet & Gynecol, Eli & Edythe Broad Ctr Regenerat Med & Stem Cell, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; [Blaschke, Kathryn; Ebata, Kevin T.; Laird, Diana J.; Ramalho-Santos, Miguel] Univ Calif San Francisco, Ctr Reprod Sci, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; [Karimi, Mohammad M.; Goyal, Preeti; Lorincz, Matthew C.] Univ British Columbia, Dept Med Genet, Inst Life Sci, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z3, Canada; [Karimi, Mohammad M.; Tam, Angela; Hirst, Martin] British Columbia Canc Agcy, Canadas Michael Smith Genome Sci Ctr, Vancouver, BC V5Z 1L3, Canada; [Zepeda-Martinez, Jorge A.; Mahapatra, Sahasransu; Rao, Anjana] La Jolla Inst Allergy & Immunol, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; [Zepeda-Martinez, Jorge A.; Mahapatra, Sahasransu; Rao, Anjana] Sanford Consortium Regenerat Med, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; [Hirst, Martin] Univ British Columbia, Dept Microbiol & Immunol, Inst Life Sci, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z3, Canada",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature12362,Article,,mlorincz@mail.ubc.ca; mrsantos@diabetes.ucsf.edu,+,"NSF; California Institute of Regenerative Medicine postdoctoral training grant [TG2-01153]; Michael Smith Foundation for Health Research; CIHR [92093]; NIH [HD065812, CA151535, DP2OD004698, OD012204]; California Institute of Regenerative Medicine","The authors wish to acknowledge the epigenomics and sequencing groups at the Michael Smith Genome Sciences Centre, Canada, for performing 5mC DIP and 5hmC DIP Illumina sequencing, as well as for technical support.

63,"The terrestrial sediment record indicates that the Earth's climate varied drastically in the Precambrian era ( before 550 million years ago), ranging from surface temperatures similar to or higher than today's to global glaciation events(1). The most continuous record of sea surface temperatures of that time has been derived from variations in oxygen isotope ratios of cherts (siliceous sediments)(2), but the long-term cooling of the oceans inferred from those data(3-5) has been questioned because the oxygen isotope signature could have been reset through the exchange with hydrothermal fluids after deposition of the sediments(6). Here we show that the silicon isotopic composition of cherts more than 550 million years old shows systematic variations with age that support the earlier conclusion of long-term ocean cooling and exclude post-depositional exchange as the main source of the isotopic variations. In agreement with other lines of evidence(1,7), a model of the silicon cycle in the Precambrian era shows that the observed silicon isotope variations imply seawater temperature changes from about 70 degrees C 3,500 million years ago to about 20 degrees C 800 million years ago.","Robert, Francois; Chaussidon, Marc","Robert, F; Chaussidon, M",969,"Museum Natl Hist Nat, CNRS, LEME Nanoanal, UMS 2679, F-75005 Paris, France; Ctr Rech Petrog & Geochim, CRPG, CNRS, F-54501 Vandoeuvre Les Nancy, France",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature05239,Article,,robert@mnhn.fr; chocho@crpg.cnrs-nancy.fr,972,,,098LZ,,,SOUTH-AFRICA; GEOCHEMISTRY; EVOLUTION; RATIOS; CHINA; MICROFOSSILS; TEMPERATURE; SOLUBILITY; DIATOMS; CYCLE,7114,NATURE,Nature,English,30,No,,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",26-Oct,4,LONDON,17066030.0,J,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2006,"Chaussidon, Marc/E-7067-2017","Robert, F (reprint author), Museum Natl Hist Nat, CNRS, LEME Nanoanal, UMS 2679, 57 Rue Cuvier, F-75005 Paris, France.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,0028-0836,NATURE,176,A palaeotemperature curve for the Precambrian oceans based on silicon isotopes in cherts,3,50,WOS:000241523400049,91,443,Multidisciplinary Sciences,190,marc,chaussidon,8471,1555,male,0,0,na,na,na,0,0,na,1.0,3,"(4126, 9345]",PDpfUb4AAAAJ
64,"Protein folding is an inherently complex process involving coordination of the intricate networks of weak interactions that stabilize native three-dimensional structures. In the conventional paradigm, simple protein structures are assumed to fold in an all-or-none process(1) that is inaccessible to experiment. Existing experimental methods therefore probe folding mechanisms indirectly. A widely used approach interprets changes in protein stability(2) and/or folding kinetics(3,4), induced by engineered mutations, in terms of the structure of the native protein. In addition to limitations in connecting energetics with structure(5), mutational methods have significant experimental uncertainties(6) and are unable to map complex networks of interactions. In contrast, analytical theory predicts small barriers to folding and the possibility of downhill folding(7,8). These theoretical predictions have been confirmed experimentally in recent years(9-11), including the observation of global downhill folding(12). However, a key remaining question is whether downhill folding can indeed lead to the high-resolution analysis of protein folding processes(13). Here we show, with the use of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), that the downhill protein BBL from Escherichia coli unfolds atom by atom starting from a defined three-dimensional structure. Thermal unfolding data on 158 backbone and side-chain protons out of a total of 204 provide a detailed view of the structural events during folding. This view confirms the statistical nature of folding, and exposes the interplay between hydrogen bonding, hydrophobic forces, backbone conformation and side-chain entropy. From the data we also obtain a map of the interaction network in this protein, which reveals the source of folding cooperativity. Our approach can be extended to other proteins with marginal barriers ( less than 3RT), providing a new tool for the study of protein folding.","Sadqi, Mourad; Fushman, David; Munoz, Victor","Sadqi, M; Fushman, D; Munoz, V",317,"Univ Maryland, Dept Chem & Biochem, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; Univ Maryland, Ctr Biomol Struct & Org, College Pk, MD 20742 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature04859,Article,,vmunoz@umd.edu,321,,,064WT,,,CHEMICAL-SHIFTS; SPEED LIMIT; 2-STATE; MODEL; STABILITY; DOMAIN,7100,NATURE,Nature,English,29,No,,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",20-Jul,5,LONDON,16799571.0,J,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2006,,"Munoz, V (reprint author), Univ Maryland, Dept Chem & Biochem, College Pk, MD 20742 USA.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,0028-0836,NATURE,177,Atom-by-atom analysis of global downhill protein folding,1,27,WOS:000239122100042,331,442,Multidisciplinary Sciences,177,victor,munoz,8882,2234,male,1,1,7356774,31505624,Víctor Muñoz,0,0,Víctor Muñoz,1.0,3,"(4126, 9345]",5LLRxnsAAAAJ
65,"Many peptides, when released as chemical messengers within the brain, have powerful influences on complex behaviours. Most strikingly, vasopressin and oxytocin, once thought of as circulating hormones whose actions were confined to peripheral organs, are now known to be released in the brain, where they have fundamentally important roles in social behaviours(1). In humans, disruptions of these peptide systems have been linked to several neurobehavioural disorders, including Prader-Willi syndrome, affective disorders and obsessive-compulsive disorder, and polymorphisms of V1a vasopressin receptor have been linked to autism(2,3). Here we report that the rat olfactory bulb contains a large population of interneurons which express vasopressin, that blocking the actions of vasopressin in the olfactory bulb impairs the social recognition abilities of rats and that vasopressin agonists and antagonists can modulate the processing of information by olfactory bulb neurons.

66,"When external stresses in a system-physical, social or virtual-are relieved through impulsive events, it is natural to focus on the attributes of these avalanches(1,2). However, during the quiescent periods between them(3), stresses may be relieved through competing processes, such as slowly flowing water between earthquakes(4) or thermally activated dislocation flow(5) between plastic bursts in crystals(6-8). Such smooth responses can in turn have marked effects on the avalanche properties(9). Here we report an experimental investigation of slowly compressed nickel microcrystals, covering three orders of magnitude in nominal strain rate, in which we observe unconventional quasi-periodic avalanche bursts and higher critical exponents as the strain rate is decreased. Our experiments are faithfully reproduced by analytic and computational dislocation avalanche modelling(10,11) that we have extended to incorporate dislocation relaxation, revealing the emergence of the self-organized avalanche oscillator: a novel critical state exhibiting oscillatory approaches towards a depinning critical point(12). This theory suggests that whenever avalanches compete with slow relaxation-in settings ranging from crystal microplasticity to earthquakes-dynamical quasi-periodic scale invariance ought to emerge.","Papanikolaou, Stefanos; Dimiduk, Dennis M.; Choi, Woosong; Sethna, James P.; Uchic, Michael D.; Woodward, Christopher F.; Zapperi, Stefano","Papanikolaou, S; Dimiduk, DM; Choi, W; Sethna, JP; Uchic, MD; Woodward, CF; Zapperi, S",517,"[Papanikolaou, Stefanos] Yale Univ, Dept Mech Engn & Mat Sci, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Papanikolaou, Stefanos] Yale Univ, Dept Phys, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Dimiduk, Dennis M.; Uchic, Michael D.; Woodward, Christopher F.] USAF, Res Lab, Mat & Mfg Directorate, AFRL RXCM, Wright Patterson AFB, OH 45433 USA; [Choi, Woosong; Sethna, James P.] Cornell Univ, Dept Phys, Atom & Solid State Phys Lab, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Zapperi, Stefano] CNR, IENI, I-20125 Milan, Italy; [Zapperi, Stefano] ISI Fdn, I-10126 Turin, Italy",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature11568,Article,,stefanos.papanikolaou@yale.edu,+,DTRA [1-10-1-0021]; DOE-BES [DE-FG02-07ER-46393]; Air Force Office of Scientific Research; Materials and Manufacturing Directorate; ComplexityNet pilot project LOCAT,"We thank J.

67,"The origin and evolution of the Moon remain controversial(1,2), with one of the most important questions for lunar evolution being the timing and duration of basaltic ( mare) magmatism(1,3-8). Here we report the result of ion microprobe U - Pb dating of phosphates in a lunar meteorite, Kalahari 009, which is classified as a very- low- Ti mare- basalt breccia. In situ analyses of five phosphate grains, associated with basaltic clasts, give an age of 4.35+/-0.15 billion years. These ancient phosphate ages are thought to represent the crystallization ages of parental basalt magma, making Kalahari 009 one of the oldest known mare basalts. We suggest that mare basalt volcanism on the Moon started as early as 4.35 Gyr ago, relatively soon after its formation and differentiation, and preceding the bulk of lunar volcanism which ensued after the late heavy bombardment around 3.8- 3.9 Gyr ( refs 7 and 8). Considering the extremely low abundances of incompatible elements such as thorium and the rare earth elements in Kalahari 009 ( ref. 9) and recent remote- sensing observations illustrating that the cryptomaria tend to be of very- low- Ti basalt type(10-12), we conclude that Kalahari 009 is our first sample of a very- low- Ti cryptomare from the Moon.","Terada, Kentaro; Anand, Mahesh; Sokol, Anna K.; Bischoff, Addi; Sano, Yuji","Terada, K; Anand, M; Sokol, AK; Bischoff, A; Sano, Y",849,"Hiroshima Univ, Dept Earth & Planetary Syst Sci, Higashihiroshima 7398526, Japan; Open Univ, CEPSAR, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, Milton Keynes MK7 6AA, Bucks, England; Nat Hist Museum, Dept Mineral, London SW7 5BD, England; Inst Planetol, D-48149 Munster, Germany; Univ Tokyo, Ocean Res Inst, Ctr Adv Marine Res, Nakano Ku, Tokyo 1648639, Japan",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature06356,Article,1476-4687,terada@sci.hiroshima-u.ac.jp; M.Anand@open.ac.uk,U14,,,237RU,,,MARE-BASALT METEORITE; VOLCANISM; EVOLUTION; PETROGENESIS; GEOCHEMISTRY; STRATIGRAPHY,7171,NATURE,Nature,English,31,No,"Anand, Mahesh/0000-0003-4026-4476","MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",6-Dec,5,LONDON,18064006.0,J,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2007,"Anand, Mahesh/E-9259-2013","Terada, K (reprint author), Hiroshima Univ, Dept Earth & Planetary Syst Sci, Higashihiroshima 7398526, Japan.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,0028-0836,NATURE,54,Cryptomare magmatism 4.35 Gyr ago recorded in lunar meteorite Kalahari 009,0,12,WOS:000251394900049,192,450,Multidisciplinary Sciences,57,yuji,sano,8788,24,male,0,0,na,na,na,0,0,na,0.96,3,"(4126, 9345]",Twuf0N4AAAAJ
68,"Nuclear pore complexes are fundamental components of all eukaryotic cells that mediate nucleocytoplasmic exchange. Determining their 110-megadalton structure imposes a formidable challenge and requires in situ structural biology approaches. Of approximately 30 nucleoporins (Nups), 15 are structured and form the Y and innerring complexes. These two major scaffolding modules assemble in multiple copies into an eight-fold rotationally symmetric structure that fuses the inner and outer nuclear membranes to forma central channel of similar to 60 nm in diameter(1). The scaffold is decorated with transport-channel Nups that often contain phenylalanine-repeat sequences and mediate the interaction with cargo complexes. Although the architectural arrangement of parts of the Y complex has been elucidated, it is unclear how exactly it oligomerizes in situ. Here we combine cryo-electron tomography with mass spectrometry, biochemical analysis, perturbation experiments and structural modelling to generate, to our knowledge, the most comprehensive architectural model of the human nuclear pore complex to date. Our data suggest previously unknown protein interfaces across Y complexes and to inner-ring complex members. We show that the transport-channel Nup358 (also known as Ranbp2) has a previously unanticipated role in Y-complex oligomerization. Our findings blur the established boundaries between scaffold and transport-channel Nups. We conclude that, similar to coated vesicles, several copies of the same structural building block-although compositionally identical-engage in different local sets of interactions and conformations.","von Appen, Alexander; Kosinski, Jan; Sparks, Lenore; Ori, Alessandro; DiGuilio, Amanda L.; Vollmer, Benjamin; Mackmull, Marie-Therese; Banterle, Niccolo; Parca, Luca; Kastritis, Panagiotis; Buczak, Katarzyna; Mosalaganti, Shyamal; Hagen, Wim; Andres-Pons, Amparo; Lemke, Edward A.; Bork, Peer; Antonin, Wolfram; Glavy, Joseph S.; Bui, Khanh Huy; Beck, Martin","von Appen, A; Kosinski, J; Sparks, L; Ori, A; DiGuilio, AL; Vollmer, B; Mackmull, MT; Banterle, N; Parca, L; Kastritis, P; Buczak, K; Mosalaganti, S; Hagen, W; Andres-Pons, A; Lemke, EA; Bork, P; Antonin, W; Glavy, JS; Bui, KH; Beck, M",140,"[von Appen, Alexander; Kosinski, Jan; Sparks, Lenore; Ori, Alessandro; Mackmull, Marie-Therese; Banterle, Niccolo; Parca, Luca; Kastritis, Panagiotis; Buczak, Katarzyna; Mosalaganti, Shyamal; Hagen, Wim; Andres-Pons, Amparo; Lemke, Edward A.; Bork, Peer; Bui, Khanh Huy; Beck, Martin] European Mol Biol Lab, Struct & Computat Biol Unit, D-69117 Heidelberg, Germany; [DiGuilio, Amanda L.; Glavy, Joseph S.] Stevens Inst Technol, Dept Chem Chem Biol & Biomed Engn, Hoboken, NJ 07030 USA; [Vollmer, Benjamin; Antonin, Wolfram] Max Planck Gesell, Friedrich Miescher Lab, D-72076 Tubingen, Germany; [Bui, Khanh Huy] McGill Univ, Dept Anat & Cell Biol, Montreal, PQ H3A 0C7, Canada",,,11/19/17,,10.1038/nature15381,Article,1476-4687,huy.bui@mcgill.ca; martin.beck@embl.de,+,EMBL's mechanical workshop; Electron Microscopy and Proteomics Core Facilities; Centre for Statistical Data Analysis; Swiss National Science Foundation; European Molecular Biology Organization; Marie Curie Actions; Alexander von Humboldt Foundation; Robert Crooks Stanley Fellowship at the Stevens Institute of Technology; National Institute on Aging (NIA) [1R21AG047433-01]; EMBL Interdisciplinary Postdoc Programme under Marie Curie COFUND Actions; Ignition Grant Initiative from Stevens Institute of Technology; NIA [1R21AG047433-01]; EMBL; European Research Council [309271-NPCAtlas],"We are grateful to W.

70,"Modern computing technology is based on writing, storing and retrieving information encoded as magnetic bits. Although the giant magnetoresistance effect has improved the electrical read out of memory elements, magnetic writing remains the object of major research efforts(1). Despite several reports of methods to reverse the polarity of nanosized magnets by means of local electric fields(2,3) and currents(4-6), the simple reversal of a high-coercivity, single-layer ferromagnet remains a challenge. Materials with large coercivity and perpendicular magnetic anisotropy represent the mainstay of data storage media, owing to their ability to retain a stable magnetization state over long periods of time and their amenability to miniaturization(7). However, the same anisotropy properties that make a material attractive for storage also make it hard to write to(8). Here we demonstrate switching of a perpendicularly magnetized cobalt dot driven by in-plane current injection at room temperature. Our device is composed of a thin cobalt layer with strong perpendicular anisotropy and Rashba interaction induced by asymmetric platinum and AlO(x) interface layers(9,10). The effective switching field is orthogonal to the direction of the magnetization and to the Rashba field. The symmetry of the switching field is consistent with the spin accumulation induced by the Rashba interaction and the spin-dependent mobility observed in non-magnetic semiconductors(11,12), as well as with the torque induced by the spin Hall effect in the platinum layer(13,14). Our measurements indicate that the switching efficiency increases with the magnetic anisotropy of the cobalt layer and the oxidation of the aluminium layer, which is uppermost, suggesting that the Rashba interaction has a key role in the reversal mechanism. To prove the potential of in-plane current switching for spintronic applications, we construct a reprogrammable magnetic switch that can be integrated into non-volatile memory and logic architectures. This device is simple, scalable and compatible with present-day magnetic recording technology.","Mihai Miron, Ioan; Garello, Kevin; Gaudin, Gilles; Zermatten, Pierre-Jean; Costache, Marius V.; Auffret, Stephane; Bandiera, Sebastien; Rodmacq, Bernard; Schuhl, Alain; Gambardella, Pietro","Miron, IM; Garello, K; Gaudin, G; Zermatten, PJ; Costache, MV; Auffret, S; Bandiera, S; Rodmacq, B; Schuhl, A; Gambardella, P",189,"[Mihai Miron, Ioan; Garello, Kevin; Costache, Marius V.; Gambardella, Pietro] Catalan Inst Nanotechnol ICN CIN2, E-08193 Barcelona, Spain; [Gaudin, Gilles; Zermatten, Pierre-Jean; Auffret, Stephane; Bandiera, Sebastien; Rodmacq, Bernard; Schuhl, Alain] INAC, CEA CNRS UJF GINP, UMR 8191, SPINTEC, F-38054 Grenoble, France; [Gambardella, Pietro] ICREA, E-08010 Barcelona, Spain; [Gambardella, Pietro] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Dept Fis, E-08193 Barcelona, Spain",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature10309,Article,,mihai.miron.icn@uab.es; pietro.gambardella.icn@uab.es,U88,"European Research Council [StG 203239 NOMAD]; Ministerio de Ciencia y Innovacion [ERA-Net EUI2008-03884, MAT2010-15659]; Agencia de Gestio d'Ajuts Universitaris i de Recerca [2009 SGR 695]; ICREA","We thank S.

71,"Translation initiation is a major determinant of the overall expression level of a gene(1 - 3). The translation of functionally active protein requires the messenger RNA to be positioned on the ribosome such that the start/ initiation codon will be read first and in the correct frame. Little is known about the molecular basis for the interaction of mRNA with the ribosome at different states of translation. Recent crystal structures of the ribosomal subunits(4 - 8), the empty 70S ribosome(9) and the 70S ribosome containing functional ligands(10 - 13) have provided information about the general organization of the ribosome and its functional centres. Here we compare the X- ray structures of eight ribosome complexes modelling the translation initiation, post- initiation and elongation states. In the initiation and post- initiation complexes, the presence of the Shine - Dalgarno ( SD) duplex causes strong anchoring of the 5' end of mRNA onto the platform of the 30S subunit, with numerous interactions between mRNA and the ribosome. Conversely, the 5' end of the ' elongator' mRNA lacking SD interactions is flexible, suggesting a different exit path for mRNA during elongation. After the initiation of translation, but while an SD interaction is still present, mRNA moves in the 3' -->5' direction with simultaneous clockwise rotation and lengthening of the SD duplex, bringing it into contact with ribosomal protein S2.","Yusupova, Gulnara; Jenner, Lasse; Rees, Bernard; Moras, Dino; Yusupov, Marat","Yusupova, G; Jenner, L; Rees, B; Moras, D; Yusupov, M",391,"Inst Genet & Biol Mol & Cellulaire, F-67404 Illkirch Graffenstaden, France",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature05281,Article,,marat@titus.u-strasbg.fr,394,,,105GL,,,ANGSTROM RESOLUTION; ESCHERICHIA-COLI; TRANSLATION INITIATION; CRYSTAL-STRUCTURES; BINDING SITE; SUBUNIT; SEQUENCES; CODON,7117,NATURE,Nature,English,25,No,"Yusupov, Marat/0000-0001-5544-0597; Jenner, Lasse/0000-0003-3917-8853","MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",16-Nov,4,LONDON,17051149.0,J,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2006,"Yusupov, Marat/I-6126-2013; Yusupova , Gulnara/E-1877-2014","Yusupov, M (reprint author), Inst Genet & Biol Mol & Cellulaire, F-67404 Illkirch Graffenstaden, France.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,0028-0836,NATURE,175,Structural basis for messenger RNA movement on the ribosome,1,19,WOS:000242018300054,51,444,Multidisciplinary Sciences,181,marat,yusupov,8025,11,male,1,1,607978,2087394,List of Tatars,0,0,List of Tatars,1.0,3,"(4126, 9345]",uGcWXC4AAAAJ

73,"Alzheimer disease (AD) is characterized by the accumulation of amyloid plaques, which are predominantly composed of amyloid-beta peptide(1). Two principal physiological pathways either prevent or promote amyloid-beta generation from its precursor, beta-amyloid precursor protein (APP), in a competitive manne(r)1. Although APP processing has been studied in great detail, unknown proteolytic events seem to hinder stoichiometric analyses of APP metabolism in vivo(2). Here we describe a new physiological APP processing pathway, which generates proteolytic fragments capable of inhibiting neuronal activity within the hippocampus. We identify higher molecular mass carboxy-terminal fragments (CTFs) of APP, termed CTF-eta, in addition to the long-known CTF-alpha and CTF-beta fragments generated by the alpha- and beta-secretases ADAM10 (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase 10) and BACE1 (beta-site APP cleaving enzyme 1), respectively. CTF-eta generation is mediated in part by membrane-bound matrix metalloproteinases such as MT5-MMP, referred to as g-secretase activity. g-Secretase cleavage occurs primarily at amino acids 504-505 of APP(695), releasing a truncated ectodomain. After shedding of this ectodomain, CTF-eta is further processed by ADAM10 and BACE1 to release long and short A eta peptides (termed A eta-alpha and A eta-beta). CTFs produced by g-secretase are enriched in dystrophic neurites in an AD mouse model and in human AD brains. Genetic and pharmacological inhibition of BACE1 activity results in robust accumulation of CTF-eta and A eta-alpha. In mice treated with a potent BACE1 inhibitor, hippocampal long-term potentiation was reduced. Notably, when recombinant or synthetic A eta-alpha was applied on hippocampal slices ex vivo, long-term potentiation was lowered. Furthermore, in vivo single-cell two-photon calcium imaging showed that hippocampal neuronal activity was attenuated by A eta-alpha. These findings not only demonstrate a major functionally relevant APP processing pathway, but may also indicate potential translational relevance for therapeutic strategies targeting APP processing.","Willem, Michael; Tahirovic, Sabina; Busche, Marc Aurel; Ovsepian, Saak V.; Chafai, Magda; Kootar, Scherazad; Hornburg, Daniel; Evans, Lewis D.

74,"Recent studies into the global causes of severe diarrhoea in young children have identified the protozoan parasite Cryptosporidium as the second most important diarrhoeal pathogen after rotavirus(1-3). Diarrhoeal disease is estimated to be responsible for 10.5% of overall child mortality(4). Cryptosporidium is also an opportunistic pathogen in the contexts of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-caused AIDS and organ transplantation(5,6). There is no vaccine and only a single approved drug that provides no benefit for those in gravest danger: malnourished children and immunocompromised patients(7,8). Cryptosporidiosisdrug and vaccine development is limited by the poor tractability of the parasite, which includes a lack of systems for continuous culture, facile animal models, and molecular genetic tools(3,9). Here we describe an experimental framework to genetically modify this important human pathogen. We established and optimized transfection of C. parvum sporozoites in tissue culture. To isolate stable transgenics we developed a mouse model that delivers sporozoites directly into the intestine, aCryptosporidium clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)/Cas9 system, and in vivo selection for aminoglycoside resistance. We derived reporter parasites suitable for in vitro and in vivo drug screening, and we evaluated the basis of drug susceptibility by gene knockout. We anticipate that the ability to genetically engineer this parasite will be transformative for Cryptosporidium research. Genetic reporters will provide quantitative correlates for disease, cure and protection, and the role of parasite genes in these processes is now open to rigorous investigation.","Vinayak, Sumiti; Pawlowic, Mattie C.; Sateriale, Adam; Brooks, Carrie F.; Studstill, Caleb J.; Bar-Peled, Yael; Cipriano, Michael J.; Striepen, Boris","Vinayak, S; Pawlowic, MC; Sateriale, A; Brooks, CF; Studstill, CJ; Bar-Peled, Y; Cipriano, MJ; Striepen, B",477,"[Vinayak, Sumiti; Pawlowic, Mattie C.; Sateriale, Adam; Brooks, Carrie F.; Studstill, Caleb J.; Bar-Peled, Yael; Cipriano, Michael J.; Striepen, Boris] Univ Georgia, Ctr Trop & Emerging Global Dis, Paul D Coverdell Ctr, Athens, GA 30602 USA; [Striepen, Boris] Univ Georgia, Dept Cellular Biol, Paul D Coverdell Ctr, Athens, GA 30602 USA",,,11/19/17,,10.1038/nature14651,Article,1476-4687,striepen@uga.edu,U232,National Institutes of Health (NIH) [R01AI112427]; Centers for Disease Control; University of Georgia Research Foundation;  [NIH T32AI060546],"We thank L.

75,"B-cell antigen receptor (BCR) expression is an important feature of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL), one of the most prevalent B-cell neoplasias in Western countries(1). The presence of stereotyped and quasi-identical BCRs in different CLL patients suggests that recognition of specific antigens might drive CLL pathogenesis. Here we show that, in contrast to other B-cell neoplasias, CLL-derived BCRs induce antigen-independent cell-autonomous signalling, which is dependent on the heavy-chain complementarity-determining region (HCDR3) and an internal epitope of the BCR. Indeed, transferring the HCDR3 of a CLL-derived BCR provides autonomous signalling capacity to a non-autonomously active BCR, whereas mutations in the internal epitope abolish this capacity. Because BCR expression was required for the binding of secreted CLL-derived BCRs to target cells, and mutations in the internal epitope reduced this binding, our results indicate a new model for CLL pathogenesis, with cell-autonomous antigen-independent signalling as a crucial pathogenic mechanism.","Duehren-von Minden, Marcus; Uebelhart, Rudolf; Schneider, Dunja; Wossning, Thomas; Bach, Martina P.; Buchner, Maike; Hofmann, Daniel; Surova, Elena; Follo, Marie; Koehler, Fabian; Wardemann, Hedda; Zirlik, Katja; Veelken, Hendrik; Jumaa, Hassan","Duhren-von Minden, M; Ubelhart, R; Schneider, D; Wossning, T; Bach, MP; Buchner, M; Hofmann, D; Surova, E; Follo, M; Kohler, F; Wardemann, H; Zirlik, K; Veelken, H; Jumaa, H",309,"[Duehren-von Minden, Marcus; Uebelhart, Rudolf; Schneider, Dunja; Wossning, Thomas; Bach, Martina P.; Hofmann, Daniel; Surova, Elena; Koehler, Fabian; Jumaa, Hassan] Univ Freiburg, Ctr Biol Signaling Studies BIOSS, D-79104 Freiburg, Germany; [Uebelhart, Rudolf; Surova, Elena] Univ Freiburg, Spemann Grad Sch Biol & Med, D-79104 Freiburg, Germany; [Buchner, Maike; Follo, Marie; Zirlik, Katja] Univ Med Ctr Freiburg, Dept Hematol Oncol, D-79106 Freiburg, Germany; [Wardemann, Hedda] Max Planck Inst Infect Biol, Max Planck Res Grp Mol Immunol, D-10117 Berlin, Germany; [Veelken, Hendrik] Leiden Univ, Med Ctr, Dept Hematol, NL-2333 ZA Leiden, Netherlands; [Jumaa, Hassan] Univ Freiburg, Fac Biol, Dept Mol Immunol, D-79108 Freiburg, Germany; [Jumaa, Hassan] Max Planck Inst Immunobiol & Epigenet, D-79108 Freiburg, Germany",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature11309,Article,1476-4687,jumaa@immunbio.mpg.de,+,"Deutsche Krebshilfe [108935]; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft [SFB746, JU463/2-1]; Excellence Initiative of the German Federal and State Governments [GSC-4]","We thank C.

76,"Polypeptide toxins have played a central part in understanding physiological and physiopathological functions of ion channels(1,2). In the field of pain, they led to important advances in basic research(3-6) and even to clinical applications(7,8). Acid-sensing ion channels (ASICs) are generally considered principal players in the pain pathway(9), including in humans(10). A snake toxin activating peripheral ASICs in nociceptive neurons has been recently shown to evoke pain(11). Here we show that a new class of three-finger peptides from another snake, the black mamba, is able to abolish pain through inhibition of ASICs expressed either in central or peripheral neurons. These peptides, which we call mambalgins, are not toxic in mice but show a potent analgesic effect upon central and peripheral injection that can be as strong as morphine. This effect is, however, resistant to naloxone, and mambalgins cause much less tolerance than morphine and no respiratory distress. Pharmacological inhibition by mambalgins combined with the use of knockdown and knockout animals indicates that blockade of heteromeric channels made of ASIC1a and ASIC2a subunits in central neurons and of ASIC1b-containing channels in nociceptors is involved in the analgesic effect of mambalgins. These findings identify new potential therapeutic targets for pain and introduce natural peptides that block them to produce a potent analgesia.","Diochot, Sylvie; Baron, Anne; Salinas, Miguel; Douguet, Dominique; Scarzello, Sabine; Dabert-Gay, Anne-Sophie; Debayle, Delphine; Friend, Valerie; Alloui, Abdelkrim; Lazdunski, Michel; Lingueglia, Eric","Diochot, S; Baron, A; Salinas, M; Douguet, D; Scarzello, S; Dabert-Gay, AS; Debayle, D; Friend, V; Alloui, A; Lazdunski, M; Lingueglia, E",552,"[Diochot, Sylvie; Baron, Anne; Salinas, Miguel; Douguet, Dominique; Scarzello, Sabine; Dabert-Gay, Anne-Sophie; Debayle, Delphine; Friend, Valerie; Lazdunski, Michel; Lingueglia, Eric] CNRS, Inst Pharmacol Mol & Cellulaire, UMR 7275, F-06560 Valbonne, France; [Diochot, Sylvie; Baron, Anne; Salinas, Miguel; Douguet, Dominique; Scarzello, Sabine; Dabert-Gay, Anne-Sophie; Debayle, Delphine; Friend, Valerie; Lazdunski, Michel; Lingueglia, Eric] Univ Nice Sophia Antipolis, F-06560 Valbonne, France; [Diochot, Sylvie; Baron, Anne; Salinas, Miguel; Friend, Valerie; Lingueglia, Eric] LabEx Ion Channel Sci & Therapeut, F-06560 Valbonne, France; [Alloui, Abdelkrim] Univ Auvergne, Clermont Univ, NEURO DOL, F-63000 Clermont Ferrand, France; [Alloui, Abdelkrim] INSERM, U1107, F-63001 Clermont Ferrand, France",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature11494,Article,,baron@ipmc.cnrs.fr; lingueglia@ipmc.cnrs.fr,+,Fondation pour la Recherche Medicale; Association Francaise contre les Myopathies; Agence Nationale de la Recherche; EMMAservice under European Union of the EC FP7 Capacities Specific Programme [227490],"We are grateful to M.

77,"The existence of bound states of elementary spin waves (magnons) in one-dimensional quantum magnets was predicted almost 80 years ago(1). Identifying signatures of magnon bound states has so far remained the subject of intense theoretical research(2-5), and their detection has proved challenging for experiments. Ultracold atoms offer an ideal setting in which to find such bound states by tracking the spin dynamics with single-spin and single-site resolution(6,7) following a local excitation(8). Here we use in situ correlation measurements to observe two-magnon bound states directly in a one-dimensional Heisenberg spin chain comprising ultracold bosonic atoms in an optical lattice. We observe the quantum dynamics of free and bound magnon states through time-resolved measurements of two spin impurities. The increased effective mass of the compound magnon state results in slower spin dynamics as compared to single-magnon excitations. We also determine the decay time of bound magnons, which is probably limited by scattering on thermal fluctuations in the system. Our results provide a new way of studying fundamental properties of quantum magnets and, more generally, properties of interacting impurities in quantum many-body systems.","Fukuhara, Takeshi; Schauss, Peter; Endres, Manuel; Hild, Sebastian; Cheneau, Marc; Bloch, Immanuel; Gross, Christian","Fukuhara, T; Schauss, P; Endres, M; Hild, S; Cheneau, M; Bloch, I; Gross, C",76,"[Fukuhara, Takeshi; Schauss, Peter; Endres, Manuel; Hild, Sebastian; Cheneau, Marc; Bloch, Immanuel; Gross, Christian] Max Planck Inst Quantum Opt, D-85748 Garching, Germany; [Cheneau, Marc] Univ Paris 11, CNRS, Inst Opt, Lab Charles Fabry,Grad Sch, F-91127 Palaiseau, France; [Bloch, Immanuel] Univ Munich, Fak Phys, D-80799 Munich, Germany",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature12541,Article,1476-4687,takeshi.fukuhara@mpq.mpg.de,+,MPG; DFG; EU; JSPS,"We thank H.

Here we identify SylA as a virulence factor because a SylA-negative mutant in Pss strain B728a obtained by gene disruption was markedly less virulent on its host, Phaseolus vulgaris (bean). We show that SylA irreversibly inhibits all three catalytic activities of eukaryotic proteasomes, thus adding proteasome inhibition to the repertoire of modes of action of virulence factors. The crystal structure of the yeast proteasome in complex with SylA revealed a novel mechanism of covalent binding to the catalytic subunits. Thus, SylA defines a new class of proteasome inhibitors that includes glidobactin A (GlbA), a structurally related compound from an unknown species of the order Burkholderiales(2), for which we demonstrate a similar proteasome inhibition mechanism. As proteasome inhibitors are a promising class of anti-tumour agents, the discovery of a novel family of inhibitory natural products, which we refer to as syrbactins, may also have implications for the development of anti-cancer drugs(3). Homologues of SylA and GlbA synthetase genes are found in some other pathogenic bacteria, including the human pathogen Burkholderia pseudomallei, the causative agent of melioidosis(4). It is thus possible that these bacteria are capable of producing proteasome inhibitors of the syrbactin class.","Groll, Michael; Schellenberg, Barbara; Bachmann, Andre S.; Archer, Crystal R.; Huber, Robert; Powell, Tracy K.; Lindow, Steven; Kaiser, Markus; Dudler, Robert","Groll, M; Schellenberg, B; Bachmann, AS; Archer, CR; Huber, R; Powell, TK; Lindow, S; Kaiser, M; Dudler, R",755,"[Schellenberg, Barbara; Dudler, Robert] Univ Zurich, Inst Plant Biol, Zurich Basel Plant Sci Ctr, CH-8008 Zurich, Switzerland; [Groll, Michael] Tech Univ Munich, Ctr Integrated Prot Sci, Dept Chem, Lehrstuhl Biochem, D-85747 Garching, Germany; [Bachmann, Andre S.; Archer, Crystal R.] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Canc Res Ctr Hawaii, Honolulu, HI 96813 USA; [Bachmann, Andre S.; Archer, Crystal R.] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Cell & Mol Biol Grad Program, John A Burns Sch Med, Honolulu, HI 96813 USA; [Huber, Robert] Max Planck Inst Biochem, D-82152 Martinsried, Germany; [Huber, Robert] Cardiff Univ, Sch Biosci, Cardiff CF10 3US, Wales; [Huber, Robert] Univ Duisburg Essen, Zentrum Med Biotechnol, D-45117 Essen, Germany; [Powell, Tracy K.; Lindow, Steven] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Plant & Microbial Biol, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Kaiser, Markus] Max Planck Soc, Chem Genom Ctr, D-44227 Dortmund, Germany",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature06782,Article,,abachmann@crch.hawaii.edu; markus.kaiser@cgc.mpg.de; rdudler@botinst.uzh.ch,U7,,,285QY,Y,N,SYRINGAE PV.-SYRINGAE; CERULENIN-MEDIATED APOPTOSIS; HYPERSENSITIVE CELL-DEATH; III EFFECTOR PROTEINS; PSEUDOMONAS-SYRINGAE; 20S PROTEASOME; BACTERIAL VIRULENCE; INNATE IMMUNITY; POWDERY MILDEW; KEY ROLE,7188,NATURE,Nature,English,36,No,,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",10-Apr,5,LONDON,18401409.0,J,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2008,"Groll, Michael/C-1174-2010; Groll, Michael/F-5572-2015","Dudler, R (reprint author), Univ Zurich, Inst Plant Biol, Zurich Basel Plant Sci Ctr, Zollikerstr 107, CH-8008 Zurich, Switzerland.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,0028-0836,NATURE,197,A plant pathogen virulence factor inhibits the eukaryotic proteasome by a novel mechanism,3,48,WOS:000254792500046,407,452,Multidisciplinary Sciences,203,robert,dudler,7289,5222,male,0,0,na,na,na,0,0,na,1.0,3,"(4126, 9345]",yROWOrkAAAAJ
79,"PHD2 serves as an oxygen sensor that rescues blood supply by regulating vessel formation and shape in case of oxygen shortage(1-5). However, it is unknown whether PHD2 can influence arteriogenesis. Here we studied the role of PHD2 in collateral artery growth by using hindlimb ischaemia as a model, a process that compensates for the lack of blood flow in case of major arterial occlusion(6-8). We show that Phd2 (also known as Egln1) haplodeficient (Phd2(+/-)) mice displayed preformed collateral arteries that preserved limb perfusion and prevented tissue necrosis in ischaemia. Improved arteriogenesis in Phd2(+/-) mice was due to an expansion of tissue-resident, M2-like macrophages(9,10) and their increased release of arteriogenic factors, leading to enhanced smooth muscle cell (SMC) recruitment and growth. Both chronic and acute deletion of one Phd2 allele in macrophages was sufficient to skew their polarization towards a pro-arteriogenic phenotype. Mechanistically, collateral vessel preconditioning relied on the activation of canonical NF-kappa B pathway in Phd2(+/-) macrophages. These results unravel how PHD2 regulates arteriogenesis and artery homeostasis by controlling a specific differentiation state in macrophages and suggest new treatment options for ischaemic disorders.","Takeda, Yukiji; Costa, Sandra; Delamarre, Estelle; Roncal, Carmen; de Oliveira, Rodrigo Leite; Squadrito, Mario Leonardo; Finisguerra, Veronica; Deschoemaeker, Sofie; Bruyere, Francoise; Wenes, Mathias; Hamm, Alexander; Serneels, Jens; Magat, Julie; Bhattacharyya, Tapan; Anisimov, Andrey; Jordan, Benedicte F.; Alitalo, Kari; Maxwell, Patrick; Gallez, Bernard; Zhuang, Zhen W.; Saito, Yoshihiko; Simons, Michael; De Palma, Michele; Mazzone, Massimiliano","Takeda, Y; Costa, S; Delamarre, E; Roncal, C; de Oliveira, RL; Squadrito, ML; Finisguerra, V; Deschoemaeker, S; Bruyere, F; Wenes, M; Hamm, A; Serneels, J; Magat, J; Bhattacharyya, T; Anisimov, A; Jordan, BF; Alitalo, K; Maxwell, P; Gallez, B; Zhuang, ZW; Saito, Y; Simons, M; De Palma, M; Mazzone, M",122,"[Takeda, Yukiji; Costa, Sandra; Delamarre, Estelle; Roncal, Carmen; de Oliveira, Rodrigo Leite; Finisguerra, Veronica; Deschoemaeker, Sofie; Wenes, Mathias; Hamm, Alexander; Serneels, Jens; Mazzone, Massimiliano] VIB, Vesalius Res Ctr, Lab Mol Oncol & Angiogenesis, B-3000 Louvain, Belgium; [Takeda, Yukiji; Costa, Sandra; Delamarre, Estelle; Roncal, Carmen; de Oliveira, Rodrigo Leite; Finisguerra, Veronica; Deschoemaeker, Sofie; Wenes, Mathias; Hamm, Alexander; Serneels, Jens; Mazzone, Massimiliano] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Vesalius Res Ctr, Lab Mol Oncol & Angiogenesis, B-3000 Louvain, Belgium; [Takeda, Yukiji; Roncal, Carmen; de Oliveira, Rodrigo Leite; Bruyere, Francoise] VIB, Vesalius Res Ctr, Lab Angiogenesis & Neurovasc Link, B-3000 Louvain, Belgium; [Takeda, Yukiji; Roncal, Carmen; de Oliveira, Rodrigo Leite; Bruyere, Francoise] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Vesalius Res Ctr, Lab Angiogenesis & Neurovasc Link, B-3000 Louvain, Belgium; [Costa, Sandra] Univ Minho, Life & Hlth Sci Res Inst, P-4710057 Braga, Portugal; [Roncal, Carmen] CIMA Univ Navarra, Atherosclerosis Res Lab, Pamplona 31008, Spain; [Squadrito, Mario Leonardo; De Palma, Michele] San Raffaele Inst, Angiogenesis & Tumor Targeting Unit, I-20132 Milan, Italy; [Squadrito, Mario Leonardo; De Palma, Michele] San Raffaele Inst, HSR TIGET, I-20132 Milan, Italy; [Squadrito, Mario Leonardo] Univ Vita Salute San Raffaele, I-20132 Milan, Italy; [Magat, Julie; Jordan, Benedicte F.; Gallez, Bernard] Catholic Univ Louvain, Biomed Magnet Resonance Unit, B-1200 Brussels, Belgium; [Bhattacharyya, Tapan; Maxwell, Patrick] UCL, Rayne Inst, London WC1E 6JF, England; [Anisimov, Andrey; Alitalo, Kari] Biomedicum Helsinki, Res Programs Unit, Mol Canc Biol Lab, Helsinki 00014, Finland; [Anisimov, Andrey; Alitalo, Kari] Biomedicum Helsinki, Inst Mol Med, Helsinki 00014, Finland; [Zhuang, Zhen W.; Simons, Michael] Yale Univ, Sch Med, New Haven, CT 06510 USA; [Saito, Yoshihiko] Nara Med Univ, Dept Internal Med 1, Nara 6348522, Japan",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature10507,Article,,massimiliano.mazzone@vib-kuleuven.be,U153,"FWO, Belgium [G.0726.10]; VIB; ARC; FCT; FWO; DFG; COST action [TD0901]; ERC","This work was supported by grants from FWO (G.0726.10), Belgium, and from VIB.

80,"DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) are highly cytotoxic DNA lesions that trigger non-proteolytic ubiquitylation of adjacent chromatin areas to generate binding sites for DNA repair factors. This depends on the sequential actions of the E3 ubiquitin ligases RNF8 and RNF168 (refs 1-6), and UBC13 (also known as UBE2N), an E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme that specifically generates K63-linked ubiquitin chains(7). Whereas RNF168 is known to catalyse ubiquitylation of H2A-type histones, leading to the recruitment of repair factors such as 53BP1 (refs 8-10), the critical substrates of RNF8 and K63-linked ubiquitylation remain elusive. Here we elucidate how RNF8 and UBC13 promote recruitment of RNF168 and downstream factors to DSB sites in human cells. We establish that UBC13-dependent K63-linked ubiquitylation at DSB sites is predominantly mediated by RNF8 but not RNF168, and that H1-type linker histones, but not core histones, represent major chromatin-associated targets of this modification. The RNF168 module (UDM1) recognizing RNF8-generated ubiquitylations(11) is a high-affinity reader of K63-ubiquitylated H1, mechanistically explaining the essential roles of RNF8 and UBC13 in recruiting RNF168 to DSBs. Consistently, reduced expression or chromatin association of linker histones impair accumulation of K63-linked ubiquitin conjugates and repair factors at DSB-flanking chromatin. These results identify histone H1 as a key target of RNF8-UBC13 in DSB signalling and expand the concept of the histone code(12,13) by showing that posttranslational modifications of linker histones can serve as important marks for recognition by factors involved in genome stability maintenance, and possibly beyond.","Thorslund, Tina; Ripplinger, Anita; Hoffmann, Saskia; Wild, Thomas; Uckelmann, Michael; Villumsen, Bine; Narita, Takeo; Sixma, Titia K.; Choudhary, Chunaram; Bekker-Jensen, Simon; Mailand, Niels","Thorslund, T; Ripplinger, A; Hoffmann, S; Wild, T; Uckelmann, M; Villumsen, B; Narita, T; Sixma, TK; Choudhary, C; Bekker-Jensen, S; Mailand, N",389,"[Thorslund, Tina; Ripplinger, Anita; Hoffmann, Saskia; Villumsen, Bine; Bekker-Jensen, Simon; Mailand, Niels] Univ Copenhagen, Fac Hlth & Med Sci, Novo Nordisk Fdn Ctr Prot Res, Ubiquitin Signaling Grp,Prot Signaling Program, Blegdamsvej 3B, DK-2200 Copenhagen, Denmark; [Wild, Thomas; Narita, Takeo; Choudhary, Chunaram] Univ Copenhagen, Fac Hlth & Med Sci, Novo Nordisk Fdn Ctr Prot Res, Prote Program, DK-2200 Copenhagen, Denmark; [Uckelmann, Michael; Sixma, Titia K.] Netherlands Canc Inst, Canc Genom Ctr, Div Biochem, NL-1066 CX Amsterdam, Netherlands",,,11/19/17,,10.1038/nature15401,Article,1476-4687,niels.mailand@cpr.ku.dk,+,"Novo Nordisk Foundation [NNF14CC0001, NNF12OC0002114]; European Research Council; Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek-Chemische Wetenschappen (NWO-CW); Danish Cancer Society; Danish Council for Independent Research","We thank D.

81,"A measurement necessarily changes the quantum state being measured, a phenomenon known as back-action. Real measurements, however, almost always cause a much stronger back-action than is required by the laws of quantum mechanics. Quantum non-demolition measurements have been devised(1-6) that keep the additional back-action entirely within observables other than the one being measured. However, this back-action on other observables often imposes its own constraints. In particular, free-space optical detection methods for single atoms and ions (such as the shelving technique(7), a sensitive and well-developed method) inevitably require spontaneous scattering, even in the dispersive regime(8). This causes irreversible energy exchange (heating), which is a limitation in atom-based quantum information processing, where it obviates straightforward reuse of the qubit. No such energy exchange is required by quantum mechanics(9). Here we experimentally demonstrate optical detection of an atomic qubit with significantly less than one spontaneous scattering event. We measure the transmission and reflection of an optical cavity(10-13) containing the atom. In addition to the qubit detection itself, we quantitatively measure how much spontaneous scattering has occurred. This allows us to relate the information gained to the amount of spontaneous emission, and we obtain a detection error below 10 per cent while scattering less than 0.2 photons on average. Furthermore, we performa quantum Zeno-type experiment to quantify the measurement back-action, and find that every incident photon leads to an almost complete state collapse. Together, these results constitute a full experimental characterization of a quantum measurement in the 'energy exchange-free' regime below a single spontaneous emission event. Besides its fundamental interest, this approach could significantly simplify proposed neutral-atom quantum computation schemes(14), and may enable sensitive detection of molecules and atoms lacking closed transitions.","Volz, Juergen; Gehr, Roger; Dubois, Guilhem; Esteve, Jerome; Reichel, Jakob","Volz, J; Gehr, R; Dubois, G; Esteve, J; Reichel, J",210,"[Volz, Juergen; Gehr, Roger; Dubois, Guilhem; Esteve, Jerome; Reichel, Jakob] Univ Paris 06, CNRS, ENS, Lab Kastler Brossel, F-75005 Paris, France",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature10225,Article,1476-4687,jakob.reichel@ens.fr,U117,EU [247687]; Institut Francilien pour la Recherche sur les Atomes Froids (IFRAF); EURYI grant 'Integrated Quantum Devices',"This work was funded in part by the AQUTE Integrated Project of the EU (grant no. 247687), by the Institut Francilien pour la Recherche sur les Atomes Froids (IFRAF), and by the EURYI grant 'Integrated Quantum Devices'.",791UA,,,QUANTUM; CAVITY,7355,NATURE,Nature,English,26,No,"Esteve, Jerome/0000-0002-1556-8120; Volz, Jurgen/0000-0002-3174-2141; Reichel, Jakob/0000-0003-3420-4178","MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",14-Jul,5,LONDON,21753851.0,J,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2011,"Esteve, Jerome/G-1084-2014; Volz, Jurgen/N-6457-2016","Reichel, J (reprint author), Univ Paris 06, CNRS, ENS, Lab Kastler Brossel, 24 Rue Lhomond, F-75005 Paris, France.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,0028-0836,NATURE,49,Measurement of the internal state of a single atom without energy exchange,0,18,WOS:000292690500046,222,475,Multidisciplinary Sciences,49,jakob,reichel,8184,148,male,1,1,38684068,174030,Jadup and Boel,0,0,Jadup and Boel,0.99,3,"(4126, 9345]",EOrqDVAAAAAJ
82,"Deep tremor in subduction zones is thought to be caused by small repeating shear slip events on the plate interface with significant slow components(1-4). It occurs at a depth of about 30 kilometres and provides valuable information on deep plate motion and shallow stress accumulation on the fault plane of megathrust earthquakes. Tremor has been suggested to repeat at a regular interval(1,2), migrate at various velocities(4-7) and be modulated by tidal stress(6,8,9). Here I show that some time-invariant interface property controls tremor behaviour, using precise location of tremor sources with event duration in western Shikoku in the Nankai subduction zone, Japan. In areas where tremor duration is short, tremor is more strongly affected by tidal stress and migration is inhibited. Where tremor lasts longer, diffusive migration occurs with a constant diffusivity of 10(4) m(2) s(-1). The control property may be the ratio of brittle to ductile areas, perhaps determined by the influence of mantle wedge serpentinization on the plate interface. The spatial variation of the controlling property seems to be characterized by striations in tremor source distribution, which follows either the current or previous plate subduction directions. This suggests that the striations and corresponding interface properties are formed through the subduction of inhomogeneous structure, such as seamounts, for periods as long as ten million years.","Ide, Satoshi","Ide, S",356,"Univ Tokyo, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo 1130033, Japan",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature09251,Article,1476-4687,ide@eps.s.u-tokyo.ac.jp,U105,JSPS [20340115]; MEXT [21107007],"I thank G.

84,"The evolution of frictional strength has great fundamental and practical importance. Applications range from earthquake dynamics(1-4) to hard-drive read/write cycles(5). Frictional strength is governed by the resistance to shear of the large ensemble of discrete contacts that forms the interface that separates two sliding bodies. An interface's overall strength is determined by both the real contact area and the contacts' shear strength(6,7). Whereas the average motion of large, slowly sliding bodies is well-described by empirical friction laws(3,8-10), interface strength is a dynamic entity that is inherently related to both fast processes such as detachment/re-attachment(11-14) and the slow process of contact area rejuvenation(6,7,13,15,16). Here we show how frictional strength evolves from extremely short to long timescales, by continuous measurements of the concurrent local evolution of the real contact area and the corresponding interface motion (slip) from the first microseconds when contact detachment occurs to large (100-second) timescales. We identify four distinct and inter-related phases of evolution. First, all of the local contact area reduction occurs within a few microseconds, on the passage of a crack-like front. This is followed by the onset of rapid slip over a characteristic time, the value of which suggests a fracture-induced reduction of contact strength before any slip occurs. This rapid slip phase culminates with a sharp transition to slip at velocities an order of magnitude slower. At slip arrest, 'ageing' immediately commences as contact area increases on a characteristic timescale determined by the system's local memory of its effective contact time before slip arrest. We show how the singular logarithmic behaviour generally associated with ageing is cut off at short times(16). These results provide a comprehensive picture of how frictional strength evolves from the short times and rapid slip velocities at the onset of motion to ageing at the long times following slip arrest.","Ben-David, Oded; Rubinstein, Shmuel M.; Fineberg, Jay","Ben-David, O; Rubinstein, SM; Fineberg, J",76,"[Ben-David, Oded; Rubinstein, Shmuel M.; Fineberg, Jay] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Racah Inst Phys, IL-91904 Jerusalem, Israel",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature08676,Article,,jay@vms.huji.ac.il,79,Israel Science Foundation [57/07]; US-Israel Binational Science Foundation [2006288],"We acknowledge comments by J.

85,"The zonal wind in the tropical stratosphere switches between prevailing easterlies and westerlies with a period of about 28 months(1). In the lowermost stratosphere, the vertical structure of this quasibiennial oscillation (QBO) is linked to the mean upwelling(2-4), which itself is a key factor in determining stratospheric composition. Evidence for changes in the QBO have until now been equivocal, raising questions as to the extent of stratospheric circulation changes in a global warming context. Here we report an analysis of near-equatorial radiosonde observations for 1953-2012, and reveal a long-term trend of weakening amplitude in the zonal wind QBO in the tropical lower stratosphere. The trend is particularly notable at the 70-hectopascal pressure level (an altitude of about 19 kilometres), where the QBO amplitudes dropped by roughly one-third over the period. This trend is also apparent in the global warming simulations of the four models in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) that realistically simulate the QBO. The weakening is most reasonably explained as resulting from a trend of increased mean tropical upwelling in the lower stratosphere. Almost all comprehensive climate models have projected an intensifying tropical upwelling in global warming scenarios(5-7), but attempts to estimate changes in the upwelling by using observational data have yielded ambiguous, inconclusive or contradictory results(8-10). Our discovery of a weakening trend in the lower-stratosphere QBO amplitude provides strong support for the existence of a long-term trend of enhanced upwelling near the tropical tropopause.","Kawatani, Yoshio; Hamilton, Kevin","Kawatani, Y; Hamilton, K",478,"[Kawatani, Yoshio] Japan Agcy Marine Earth Sci & Technol, Res Inst Global Change, Kanazawa Ku, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2360001, Japan; [Hamilton, Kevin] Univ Hawaii Manoa, SOEST, Int Pacific Res Ctr, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature12140,Article,,yoskawatani@jamstec.go.jp,+,"Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology through International Pacific Research Center; Ministry of the Environment, Japan [A-1201]; JSPS KAKENHI [23740363, 24340113]; NASA [NNX07AG53G]; NOAA [NA11NMF4320128]; International Pacific Research Center; Data Integration and Analysis System (DIAS) Fund for National Key Technology from MEXT","This work was supported by the Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology through its support of the International Pacific Research Center, by the Environment Research and Technology Development Fund (A-1201) of the Ministry of the Environment, Japan and by JSPS KAKENHI grant nos 23740363 and 24340113.

86,"Electrons have an intrinsic, indivisible, magnetic dipole aligned with their internal angular momentum (spin). The magnetic interaction between two electronic spins can therefore impose a change in their orientation. Similar dipolar magnetic interactions exist between other spin systems and have been studied experimentally. Examples include the interaction between an electron and its nucleus and the interaction between several multi-electron spin complexes(1-5). The challenge in observing such interactions for two electrons is twofold. First, at the atomic scale, where the coupling is relatively large, it is often dominated by the much larger Coulomb exchange counterpart(1). Second, on scales that are substantially larger than the atomic, the magnetic coupling is very weak and can be well below the ambient magnetic noise. Here we report the measurement of the magnetic interaction between the two ground-state spin-1/2 valence electrons of two Sr-88(+) ions, cotrapped in an electric Paul trap. We varied the ion separation, d, between 2.18 and 2.76 micrometres and measured the electrons' weak, millihertz-scale, magnetic interaction as a function of distance, in the presence of magnetic noise that was six orders of magnitude larger than the magnetic fields the electrons apply on each other. The cooperative spin dynamics was kept coherent for 15 seconds, during which spin entanglement was generated, as verified by a negative measured value of -0.16 for the swap entanglement witness. The sensitivity necessary for this measurement was provided by restricting the spin evolution to a decoherence-free subspace that is immune to collective magnetic field noise. Our measurements show a d(-3.0(4)) distance dependence for the coupling, consistent with the inverse-cube law.","Kotler, Shlomi; Akerman, Nitzan; Navon, Nir; Glickman, Yinnon; Ozeri, Roee","Kotler, S; Akerman, N; Navon, N; Glickman, Y; Ozeri, R",376,"[Kotler, Shlomi; Akerman, Nitzan; Navon, Nir; Glickman, Yinnon; Ozeri, Roee] Weizmann Inst Sci, Dept Phys Complex Syst, IL-76100 Rehovot, Israel",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature13403,Article,1476-4687,shlomi.kotler@weizmann.ac.il,380,Israeli Science Foundation; Crown Photonics Center; German-Israeli Science Foundation,"We thank J.

87,"Significant changes in physical and biological systems are occurring on all continents and in most oceans, with a concentration of available data in Europe and North America. Most of these changes are in the direction expected with warming temperature. Here we show that these changes in natural systems since at least 1970 are occurring in regions of observed temperature increases, and that these temperature increases at continental scales cannot be explained by natural climate variations alone. Given the conclusions from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fourth Assessment Report that most of the observed increase in global average temperatures since the mid-twentieth century is very likely to be due to the observed increase in anthropogenic greenhouse gas concentrations, and furthermore that it is likely that there has been significant anthropogenic warming over the past 50 years averaged over each continent except Antarctica, we conclude that anthropogenic climate change is having a significant impact on physical and biological systems globally and in some continents.","Rosenzweig, Cynthia; Karoly, David; Vicarelli, Marta; Neofotis, Peter; Wu, Qigang; Casassa, Gino; Menzel, Annette; Root, Terry L.; Estrella, Nicole; Seguin, Bernard; Tryjanowski, Piotr; Liu, Chunzhen; Rawlins, Samuel; Imeson, Anton","Rosenzweig, C; Karoly, D; Vicarelli, M; Neofotis, P; Wu, QG; Casassa, G; Menzel, A; Root, TL; Estrella, N; Seguin, B; Tryjanowski, P; Liu, CZ; Rawlins, S; Imeson, A",353,"[Rosenzweig, Cynthia; Vicarelli, Marta; Neofotis, Peter] NASA, Goddard Inst Space Studies, New York, NY 10025 USA; [Rosenzweig, Cynthia; Vicarelli, Marta; Neofotis, Peter] Columbia Ctr Climate Syst Res, New York, NY 10025 USA; [Karoly, David] Univ Melbourne, Sch Earth Sci, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia; [Wu, Qigang] Univ Oklahoma, Sch Meteorol, Norman, OK 73019 USA; [Casassa, Gino] Ctr Estudios Cient, Valdivia, Chile; [Menzel, Annette; Estrella, Nicole] Tech Univ Munich, Ctr Life & Food Sci Weihenstephan, D-85354 Freising Weihenstephan, Germany; [Root, Terry L.] Stanford Univ, Ctr Environm Sci & Policy, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Seguin, Bernard] INRA Unite Agroclim, F-84914 Avignon 9, France; [Tryjanowski, Piotr] Adam Mickiewicz Univ, Dept Behav Ecol, Inst Environm Biol, PL-61614 Poznan, Poland; [Liu, Chunzhen] China Water Informat Ctr, Beijing 100761, Peoples R China; [Rawlins, Samuel] Caribbean Epidemiol Ctr, Port Of Spain, Trinid & Tobago; [Imeson, Anton] 3D Environm Change, NL-1851 AM Heiloo, Netherlands",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature06937,Article,1476-4687,crosenzweig@giss.nasa.gov,U20,,,301AI,Y,N,LONG-TERM CHANGES; DISCONTINUOUS PERMAFROST; SURFACE CLIMATE; VARIABILITY; PHENOLOGY; PATTERN; RETREAT; TRENDS,7193,NATURE,Nature,English,39,No,"Karoly, David/0000-0002-8671-2994; Menzel, Annette/0000-0002-7175-2512","MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",15-May,6,LONDON,18480817.0,J,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2008,"Tryjanowski, Piotr/C-1367-2009; Karoly, David/C-8262-2011; Menzel, Annette/B-1105-2013","Rosenzweig, C (reprint author), NASA, Goddard Inst Space Studies, 2800 Broadway, New York, NY 10025 USA.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,0028-0836,NATURE,589,Attributing physical and biological impacts to anthropogenic climate change,29,460,WOS:000255868400043,320,453,Multidisciplinary Sciences,615,anton,imeson,8084,537,male,1,1,59416,59416,Soil erosion,0,0,Soil erosion,1.0,3,"(4126, 9345]",GNKI7RYAAAAJ
88,"The concept of disease-specific chemotherapy was developed a century ago. Dyes and arsenical compounds that displayed selectivity against trypanosomes were central to this work(1,2), and the drugs that emerged remain in use for treating human African trypanosomiasis (HAT)(3). The importance of understanding the mechanisms underlying selective drug action and resistance for the development of improved HAT therapies has been recognized, but these mechanisms have remained largely unknown. Here we use all five current HAT drugs for genome-scale RNA interference target sequencing (RIT-seq) screens in Trypanosoma brucei, revealing the transporters, organelles, enzymes and metabolic pathways that function to facilitate antitrypanosomal drug action. RIT-seq profiling identifies both known drug importers(4,5) and the only known prodrug activator(6), and links more than fifty additional genes to drug action. A bloodstream stage-specific invariant surface glycoprotein (ISG75) family mediates suramin uptake, and the AP1 adaptin complex, lysosomal proteases and major lysosomal transmembrane protein, as well as spermidine and N-acetylglucosamine biosynthesis, all contribute to suramin action. Further screens link ubiquinone availability to nitro-drug action, plasma membrane P-type H+-ATPases to pentamidine action, and trypanothione and several putative kinases to melarsoprol action. We also demonstrate a major role for aquaglyceroporins in pentamidine and melarsoprol cross-resistance. These advances in our understanding of mechanisms of antitrypanosomal drug efficacy and resistance will aid the rational design of new therapies and help to combat drug resistance, and provide unprecedented molecular insight into the mode of action of antitrypanosomal drugs.","Alsford, Sam; Eckert, Sabine; Baker, Nicola; Glover, Lucy; Sanchez-Flores, Alejandro; Leung, Ka Fai; Turner, Daniel J.; Field, Mark C.; Berriman, Matthew; Horn, David","Alsford, S; Eckert, S; Baker, N; Glover, L; Sanchez-Flores, A; Leung, KF; Turner, DJ; Field, MC; Berriman, M; Horn, D",232,"[Alsford, Sam; Baker, Nicola; Glover, Lucy; Horn, David] London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, London WC1E 7HT, England; [Eckert, Sabine; Sanchez-Flores, Alejandro; Turner, Daniel J.; Berriman, Matthew] Wellcome Trust Sanger Inst, Cambridge CB10 1SA, England; [Leung, Ka Fai; Field, Mark C.] Univ Cambridge, Dept Pathol, Cambridge CB2 1QP, England",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature10771,Article,1476-4687,david.horn@lshtm.ac.uk,U125,"Wellcome Trust [093010/Z/10/Z, 085775/Z/08/Z, 090007/Z/09/Z]; Bloomsbury colleges PhD studentship","We thank J.

89,"After fertilization, maternal factors direct development and trigger zygotic genome activation (ZGA) at the maternal-to-zygotic transition (MZT). In zebrafish, ZGA is required for gastrulation and clearance of maternal messenger RNAs, which is in part regulated by the conserved microRNA miR-430. However, the factors that activate the zygotic program in vertebrates are unknown. Here we show that Nanog, Pou5f1 (also called Oct4) and SoxB1 regulate zygotic gene activation in zebrafish. We identified several hundred genes directly activated by maternal factors, constituting the first wave of zygotic transcription. Ribosome profiling revealed that nanog, sox19b and pou5f1 are the most highly translated transcription factors pre-MZT. Combined loss of these factors resulted in developmental arrest before gastrulation and a failure to activate >75% of zygotic genes, including miR-430. Our results demonstrate that maternal Nanog, Pou5f1 and SoxB1 are required to initiate the zygotic developmental program and induce clearance of the maternal program by activating miR-430 expression.","Lee, Miler T.; Bonneau, Ashley R.; Takacs, Carter M.; Bazzini, Ariel A.; DiVito, Kate R.; Fleming, Elizabeth S.; Giraldez, Antonio J.","Lee, MT; Bonneau, AR; Takacs, CM; Bazzini, AA; DiVito, KR; Fleming, ES; Giraldez, AJ",360,"[Lee, Miler T.; Bonneau, Ashley R.; Takacs, Carter M.; Bazzini, Ariel A.; DiVito, Kate R.; Fleming, Elizabeth S.; Giraldez, Antonio J.] Yale Univ, Sch Med, Dept Genet, New Haven, CT 06510 USA; [Giraldez, Antonio J.] Yale Univ, Sch Med, Yale Stem Cell Ctr, New Haven, CT 06520 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature12632,Article,1476-4687,antonio.giraldez@yale.edu,+,"NIH [F32HD071697-02, T32GM007499, F32HD061194-03]; Pew Fellows Program in Biomedical Sciences; Pew Scholars Program in the Biomedical Sciences; Yale Scholars Program;  [R01GM081602-06];  [R01GM103789-01];  [R01HD074078-02]","We thank Y.

90,"Staphylococcal superantigen-carrying pathogenicity islands (SaPIs) are discrete, chromosomally integrated units of similar to 15 kilobases that are induced by helper phages to excise and replicate. SaPI DNA is then efficiently encapsidated in phage-like infectious particles, leading to extremely high frequencies of intra-as well as intergeneric transfer(1-3). In the absence of helper phage lytic growth, the island is maintained in a quiescent prophage-like state by a global repressor, Stl, which controls expression of most of the SaPI genes(4). Here we show that SaPI derepression is effected by a specific, non-essential phage protein that binds to Stl, disrupting the Stl-DNA complex and thereby initiating the excision-replication-packaging cycle of the island. Because SaPIs require phage proteins to be packaged(5,6), this strategy assures that SaPIs will be transferred once induced. Several different SaPIs are induced by helper phage 80 alpha and, in each case, the SaPI commandeers a different non-essential phage protein for its derepression. The highly specific interactions between different SaPI repressors and helper-phage-encoded anti-repressors represent a remarkable evolutionary adaptation involved in pathogenicity island mobilization.","Angeles Tormo-Mas, Maria; Mir, Ignacio; Shrestha, Archana; Tallent, Sandra M.; Campoy, Susana; Lasa, Inigo; Barbe, Jordi; Novick, Richard P.; Christie, Gail E.; Penades, Jose R.","Tormo-Mas, MA; Mir, I; Shrestha, A; Tallent, SM; Campoy, S; Lasa, I; Barbe, J; Novick, RP; Christie, GE; Penades, JR",779,"[Angeles Tormo-Mas, Maria; Mir, Ignacio; Penades, Jose R.] Inst Valenciano Invest Agr, CITA, Segorbe 12400, Castellon, Spain; [Shrestha, Archana; Tallent, Sandra M.; Christie, Gail E.] Virginia Commonwealth Univ, Dept Microbiol & Immunol, Sch Med, Richmond, VA 23298 USA; [Campoy, Susana; Barbe, Jordi] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Dept Genet & Microbiol, E-08193 Barcelona, Spain; [Lasa, Inigo] Univ Publ Navarra, CSIC, Inst Agrobiotecnol, Navarra 31006, Spain; [Novick, Richard P.] NYU, Med Ctr, Skirball Inst Program Mol Pathogenesis, New York, NY 10016 USA; [Novick, Richard P.] NYU, Med Ctr, Dept Microbiol, New York, NY 10016 USA; [Novick, Richard P.] NYU, Med Ctr, Dept Med, New York, NY 10016 USA; [Penades, Jose R.] Univ Cardenal Herrera CEU, Dept Quim Bioquim & Biol Mol, Valencia 46113, Spain",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature09065,Article,,penades_jos@gva.es,U7,"Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovacion (MICINN) [CSD2009-00006, BIO2005-08399-C02-02, BIO2008-05284-C02-02, BIO2008-00642-E/C, BFU2008-01078]; Cardenal Herrera-CEU University [PRCEU-UCH25/08]; Conselleria de Agricultura, Pesca i Alimentacio (CAPiA); Generalitat Valenciana [ACOMP07/258]; Generalitat de Catalunya [2009SGR1106]; NIH [R21AI067654, R01AI022159-23A2]; A.

91,"Volcanic tremor is a ubiquitous feature of explosive eruptions. This oscillation persists for minutes to weeks and is characterized by a remarkably narrow band of frequencies from about 0.5 Hz to 7 Hz (refs 1-4). Before major eruptions, tremor can occur in concert with increased gas flux and related ground deformation(5-7). Volcanic tremor is thus of particular value for eruption forecasting(6,8). Most models for volcanic tremor rely on specific properties of the geometry, structure and constitution of volcanic conduits as well as the gas content of the erupting magma. Because neither the initial structure nor the evolution of the magma-conduit system will be the same from one volcano to the next, it is surprising that tremor characteristics are so consistent among different volcanoes. Indeed, this universality of tremor properties remains a major enigma. Here we employ the contemporary view that silicic magma rises in the conduit as a columnar plug surrounded by a highly vesicular annulus of sheared bubbles(9,10). We demonstrate that, for most geologically relevant conditions, the magma column will oscillate or 'wag' against the restoring 'gas-spring' force of the annulus at observed tremor frequencies. In contrast to previous models, the magma-wagging oscillation is relatively insensitive to the conduit structure and geometry, which explains the narrow band of tremor frequencies observed around the world. Moreover, the model predicts that as an eruption proceeds there will be an upward drift in both the maximum frequency and the total signal frequency bandwidth, the nature of which depends on the explosivity of the eruption, as is often observed.","Jellinek, A.

Such an environment leads to considerable intercellular variability in circuit behaviour, which can hinder functionality at the colony level. Here we engineer the synchronization of thousands of oscillating colony 'biopixels' over centimetre-length scales through the use of synergistic intercellular coupling involving quorum sensing within a colony and gas-phase redox signalling between colonies. We use this platform to construct a liquid crystal display (LCD)-like macroscopic clock that can be used to sense arsenic via modulation of the oscillatory period. Given the repertoire of sensing capabilities of bacteria such as Escherichia coli, the ability to coordinate their behaviour over large length scales sets the stage for the construction of low cost genetic biosensors that are capable of detecting heavy metals and pathogens in the field.","Prindle, Arthur; Samayoa, Phillip; Razinkov, Ivan; Danino, Tal; Tsimring, Lev S.; Hasty, Jeff","Prindle, A; Samayoa, P; Razinkov, I; Danino, T; Tsimring, LS; Hasty, J",39,"[Prindle, Arthur; Razinkov, Ivan; Danino, Tal; Hasty, Jeff] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Bioengn, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Samayoa, Phillip; Hasty, Jeff] Univ Calif San Diego, Bioinformat Program, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Tsimring, Lev S.; Hasty, Jeff] Univ Calif San Diego, BioCircuits Inst, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Hasty, Jeff] Univ Calif San Diego, Div Biol Sci, Mol Biol Sect, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature10722,Article,,hasty@bioeng.ucsd.edu,44,National Institutes of Health and General Medicine [R01GM69811]; San Diego Center for Systems Biology [P50GM085764]; DoD NDSEG; NSF; Office of Naval Research [MURI N00014-07-0741],"This work was supported by the National Institutes of Health and General Medicine (R01GM69811), the San Diego Center for Systems Biology (P50GM085764), the DoD NDSEG (A.

93,"The primate lentivirus auxiliary protein Vpx counteracts an unknown restriction factor that renders human dendritic and myeloid cells largely refractory to HIV-1 infection(1-6). Here we identify SAMHD1 as this restriction factor. SAMHD1 is a protein involved in Aicardi-Goutieres syndrome, a genetic encephalopathy with symptoms mimicking congenital viral infection, that has been proposed to act as a negative regulator of the interferon response(7). We show that Vpx induces proteasomal degradation of SAMHD1. Silencing of SAMHD1 in non-permissive cell lines alleviates HIV-1 restriction and is associated with a significant accumulation of viral DNA in infected cells. Concurrently, overexpression of SAMHD1 in sensitive cells inhibits HIV-1 infection. The putative phosphohydrolase activity of SAMHD1 is probably required for HIV-1 restriction. Vpx-mediated relief of restriction is abolished in SAMHD1-negative cells. Finally, silencing of SAMHD1 markedly increases the susceptibility of monocytic-derived dendritic cells to infection. Our results demonstrate that SAMHD1 is an antiretroviral protein expressed in cells of the myeloid lineage that inhibits an early step of the viral life cycle.","Laguette, Nadine; Sobhian, Bijan; Casartelli, Nicoletta; Ringeard, Mathieu; Chable-Bessia, Christine; Segeral, Emmanuel; Yatim, Ahmad; Emiliani, Stephane; Schwartz, Olivier; Benkirane, Monsef","Laguette, N; Sobhian, B; Casartelli, N; Ringeard, M; Chable-Bessia, C; Segeral, E; Yatim, A; Emiliani, S; Schwartz, O; Benkirane, M",654,"[Laguette, Nadine; Sobhian, Bijan; Ringeard, Mathieu; Chable-Bessia, Christine; Yatim, Ahmad; Benkirane, Monsef] CNRS, Inst Genet Humaine, Lab Virol Mol, UPR1142, F-34000 Montpellier, France; [Casartelli, Nicoletta; Schwartz, Olivier] CNRS, Inst Pasteur, Virus & Immun Unit, URA 3015, Paris, France; [Segeral, Emmanuel; Emiliani, Stephane] Univ Paris 05, CNRS, Inst Cochin, UMR 8104,INSERM,U567, Paris, France",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature10117,Article,1476-4687,nadine.laguette@igh.cnrs.fr; monsef.benkirane@igh.cnrs.fr,U132,ERC [250333]; Sidaction; ANRS; FRM 'equipe labellisee'; CNRS/region Languedoc Roussillon; European FP7 [201412]; Institut Pasteur,"We wish to thank members of the Molecular Virology laboratory for critical reading of the manuscript, N.

94,"The coupling of electrons to matter lies at the heart of our understanding of material properties such as electrical conductivity. Electron-phonon coupling can lead to the formation of a Cooper pair out of two repelling electrons, which forms the basis for Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer superconductivity(1). Here we study the interaction of a single localized electron with a Bose-Einstein condensate and show that the electron can excite phonons and eventually trigger a collective oscillation of the whole condensate. We find that the coupling is surprisingly strong compared to that of ionic impurities, owing to the more favourable mass ratio. The electron is held in place by a single charged ionic core, forming a Rydberg bound state. This Rydberg electron is described by a wavefunction extending to a size of up to eight micrometres, comparable to the dimensions of the condensate. In such a state, corresponding to a principal quantum number of n = 202, the Rydberg electron is interacting with several tens of thousands of condensed atoms contained within its orbit. We observe surprisingly long lifetimes and finite size effects caused by the electron exploring the outer regions of the condensate. We anticipate future experiments on electron orbital imaging, the investigation of phonon-mediated coupling of single electrons, and applications in quantum optics.","Balewski, Jonathan B.; Krupp, Alexander T.; Gaj, Anita; Peter, David; Buechler, Hans Peter; Loew, Robert; Hofferberth, Sebastian; Pfau, Tilman","Balewski, JB; Krupp, AT; Gaj, A; Peter, D; Buchler, HP; Low, R; Hofferberth, S; Pfau, T",664,"[Balewski, Jonathan B.; Krupp, Alexander T.; Gaj, Anita; Loew, Robert; Hofferberth, Sebastian; Pfau, Tilman] Univ Stuttgart, Phys Inst 5, D-70569 Stuttgart, Germany; [Peter, David; Buechler, Hans Peter] Univ Stuttgart, Inst Theoret Phys 3, D-70569 Stuttgart, Germany",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature12592,Article,1476-4687,t.pfau@physik.uni-stuttgart.de,667,"Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) [SFB/TRR21, PF 381/4-2]; ERC [267100]; EU Marie Curie programme ITN-Coherence [265031]; DFG [HO 4787/1-1]","We thank K.

95,"The terrestrial and lunar cratering rate is often assumed to have been nearly constant over the past 3Gyr. Different lines of evidence, however, suggest that the impact flux from kilometre-sized bodies increased by at least a factor of two over the long-term average during the past similar to,100 Myr. Here we argue that this apparent surge was triggered by the catastrophic disruption of the parent body of the asteroid Baptistina, which we infer was a similar to 170-km-diameter body ( carbonaceous-chondrite-like) that broke up 160(-20)(+30) Myr ago in the inner main asteroid belt. Fragments produced by the collision were slowly delivered by dynamical processes to orbits where they could strike the terrestrial planets. We find that this asteroid shower is the most likely source (. 90 per cent probability) of the Chicxulub impactor that produced the Cretaceous/Tertiary ( K/T) mass extinction event 65 Myr ago.","Bottke, William F.; Vokrouhlicky, David; Nesvorny, David","Bottke, WF; Vokrouhlicky, D; Nesvorny, D",48,"SW Res Inst, Boulder, CO 80302 USA; Charles Univ Prague, Inst Astron, CR-18000 Prague 8, Czech Republic",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature06070,Article,,bottke@boulder.swri.edu,53,,,207ED,,,NEAR-EARTH OBJECTS; FAMILIES; DISTRIBUTIONS; SIMULATIONS; POPULATION; DISRUPTION; METEORITES; CRATERS; HAZARD; COMETS,7158,NATURE,Nature,English,50,No,,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",6-Sep,6,LONDON,17805288.0,J,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2007,,"Bottke, WF (reprint author), SW Res Inst, 1050 Walnut St,Suite 300, Boulder, CO 80302 USA.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,0028-0836,NATURE,88,An asteroid breakup 160 Myr ago as the probable source of the K/T impactor,3,27,WOS:000249233500033,420,449,Multidisciplinary Sciences,90,david,nesvorny,11063,12593,male,1,1,39937576,886732,Hunt for Exomoons with Kepler,0,0,Hunt for Exomoons with Kepler,1.0,4,"(9345, 17929]",BeLy4xcAAAAJ
96,"Channels and transporters of the ClC family cause the transmembrane movement of inorganic anions in service of a variety of biological tasks, from the unusual-the generation of the kilowatt pulses with which electric fish stun their prey-to the quotidian-the acidification of endosomes, vacuoles and lysosomes(1). The homodimeric architecture of ClC proteins, initially inferred from single-molecule studies of an elasmobranch Cl(-) channel(2) and later confirmed by crystal structures of bacterial Cl(-)/H(+) antiporters(3,4), is apparently universal. Moreover, the basic machinery that enables ion movement through these proteins-the aqueous pores for anion diffusion in the channels and the ion-coupling chambers that coordinate Cl(-) and H(+) antiport in the transporters-are contained wholly within each subunit of the homodimer. The near-normal function of a bacterial ClC transporter straitjacketed by covalent cross-links across the dimer interface and the behaviour of a concatemeric human homologue argue that the transport cycle resides within each subunit and does not require rigid-body rearrangements between subunits(5,6). However, this evidence is only inferential, and because examples are known in which quaternary rearrangements of extramembrane ClC domains that contribute to dimerization modulate transport activity(7), we cannot declare as definitive a 'parallel-pathways' picture in which the homodimer consists of two singlesubunit transporters operating independently. A strong prediction of such a view is that it should in principle be possible to obtain a monomeric ClC. Here we exploit the known structure of a ClC Cl(-)/H(+) exchanger, ClC-ec1 from Escherichia coli, to design mutants that destabilize the dimer interface while preserving both the structure and the transport function of individual subunits. The results demonstrate that the ClC subunit alone is the basic functional unit for transport and that cross-subunit interaction is not required for Cl(-)/H(+) exchange in ClC transporters.","Robertson, Janice L.; Kolmakova-Partensky, Ludmila; Miller, Christopher","Robertson, JL; Kolmakova-Partensky, L; Miller, C",844,"[Robertson, Janice L.; Kolmakova-Partensky, Ludmila; Miller, Christopher] Brandeis Univ, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Dept Biochem, Waltham, MA 02454 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature09556,Article,,cmiller@brandeis.edu,847,"Howard Hughes Medical Institute; NIGMS NIH HHS [R01 GM031768, R37 GM031768]",,691PQ,,,/H+ EXCHANGE TRANSPORTER; CHLORIDE CHANNEL; AMMONIA TRANSPORT; ESCHERICHIA-COLI; MECHANISM; SELECTIVITY; DIMERIZATION; ENERGETICS; PROTEINS; ANGSTROM,7325,NATURE,Nature,English,30,No,,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",9-Dec,4,LONDON,21048711.0,J,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2010,,"Miller, C (reprint author), Brandeis Univ, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Dept Biochem, Waltham, MA 02454 USA.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,0028-0836,NATURE,50,"Design, function and structure of a monomeric ClC transporter",4,28,WOS:000285093700050,199,468,Multidisciplinary Sciences,52,christopher,miller,15822,2339,male,0,0,na,na,na,0,0,na,1.0,4,"(9345, 17929]",0ryVFl8AAAAJ
97,"Discovering the unintended 'off-targets' that predict adverse drug reactions is daunting by empirical methods alone. Drugs can act on several protein targets, some of which can be unrelated by conventional molecular metrics, and hundreds of proteins have been implicated in side effects. Here we use a computational strategy to predict the activity of 656 marketed drugs on 73 unintended 'side-effect' targets. Approximately half of the predictions were confirmed, either from proprietary databases unknown to the method or by new experimental assays. Affinities for these new off-targets ranged from 1nM to 30 mu M. To explore relevance, we developed an association metric to prioritize those new off-targets that explained side effects better than any known target of a given drug, creating a drug-target-adverse drug reaction network. Among these new associations was the prediction that the abdominal pain side effect of the synthetic oestrogen chlorotrianisene was mediated through its newly discovered inhibition of the enzyme cyclooxygenase-1. The clinical relevance of this inhibition was borne out in whole human blood platelet aggregation assays. This approach may have wide application to de-risking toxicological liabilities in drug discovery.","Lounkine, Eugen; Keiser, Michael J.; Whitebread, Steven; Mikhailov, Dmitri; Hamon, Jacques; Jenkins, Jeremy L.; Lavan, Paul; Weber, Eckhard; Doak, Allison K.; Cote, Serge; Shoichet, Brian K.; Urban, Laszlo","Lounkine, E; Keiser, MJ; Whitebread, S; Mikhailov, D; Hamon, J; Jenkins, JL; Lavan, P; Weber, E; Doak, AK; Cote, S; Shoichet, BK; Urban, L",361,"[Lounkine, Eugen; Whitebread, Steven; Mikhailov, Dmitri; Jenkins, Jeremy L.; Urban, Laszlo] Novartis Inst Biomed Res, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Keiser, Michael J.] SeaChange Pharmaceut Inc, San Francisco, CA 94158 USA; [Keiser, Michael J.; Doak, Allison K.; Shoichet, Brian K.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Pharmaceut Chem, San Francisco, CA 94158 USA; [Hamon, Jacques; Lavan, Paul; Weber, Eckhard; Cote, Serge] Novartis Inst Biomed Res, CH-4056 Basel, Switzerland",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature11159,Article,,jeremy.jenkins@novartis.com; shoichet@cgl.ucsf.edu; laszlo.urban@novartis.com,+,"US National Institutes of Health [GM71896, AG002132, GM93456]; QB3 Rogers Family Foundation 'Bridging-the-Gap' Award","E.

98,"The fast growth of information technology has been sustained by continuous scaling down of the silicon-based metal-oxide field-effect transistor. However, such technology faces two major challenges to further scaling. First, the device electrostatics (the ability of the transistor's gate electrode to control its channel potential) are degraded when the channel length is decreased, using conventional bulk materials such as silicon as the channel. Recently, two-dimensional semiconducting materials(1-7) have emerged as promising candidates to replace silicon, as they can maintain excellent device electrostatics even at much reduced channel lengths. The second, more severe, challenge is that the supply voltage can no longer be scaled down by the same factor as the transistor dimensions because of the fundamental thermionic limitation of the steepness of turn-on characteristics, or subthreshold swing(8,9). To enable scaling to continue without a power penalty, a different transistor mechanism is required to obtain subthermionic subthreshold swing, such as band-to-band tunnelling(10-16). Here we demonstrate band-to-band tunnel field-effect transistors (tunnelFETs), based on a two-dimensional semiconductor, that exhibit steep turn-on; subthreshold swing is a minimum of 3.9 millivolts per decade and an average of 31.1 millivolts per decade for four decades of drain current at room temperature. By using highly doped germanium as the source and atomically thin molybdenum disulfide as the channel, a vertical heterostructure is built with excellent electrostatics, a strain-free heterointerface, a lowtunnelling barrier, and a large tunnelling area. Our atomically thin and layered semiconducting-channel tunnel-FET(ATLAS-TFET) is the only planar architecture tunnel-FET to achieve subthermionic subthreshold swing over four decades of drain current, as recommended in ref. 17, and is also the only tunnel-FET(inany architecture) to achieve this at a low power-supply voltage of 0.1 volts. Our device is at present the thinnest-channel subthermionic transistor, and has the potential to open up new avenues for ultra-dense and low-power integrated circuits, as well as for ultra-sensitive biosensors and gas sensors(18-21).","Sarkar, Deblina; Xie, Xuejun; Liu, Wei; Cao, Wei; Kang, Jiahao; Gong, Yongji; Kraemer, Stephan; Ajayan, Pulickel M.; Banerjee, Kaustav","Sarkar, D; Xie, XJ; Liu, W; Cao, W; Kang, JH; Gong, YJ; Kraemer, S; Ajayan, PM; Banerjee, K",91,"[Sarkar, Deblina; Xie, Xuejun; Liu, Wei; Cao, Wei; Kang, Jiahao; Banerjee, Kaustav] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; [Gong, Yongji; Ajayan, Pulickel M.] Rice Univ, Dept Mat Sci & Nanoengn, Houston, TX 77005 USA; [Kraemer, Stephan] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Mat, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA",,,11/19/17,,10.1038/nature15387,Article,1476-4687,kaustav@ece.ucsb.edu,95,Air Force Office of Scientific Research [FA9550-14-1-0268]; US NSF [CCF-1162633]; Army Research Office (MURI) [W911NF-11-1-0362]; MRSEC Program of the NSF [DMR1121053]; NSF-funded Materials Research Facilities Network,"This work was supported by the Air Force Office of Scientific Research (grant FA9550-14-1-0268) and the US NSF (grant CCF-1162633).

99,"Large earthquakes trigger very small earthquakes globally during passage of the seismic waves and during the following several hours to days(1-10), but so far remote aftershocks of moment magnitude M >= 5.5 have not been identified(11), with the lone exception of an M = 6.9 quake remotely triggered by the surface waves from an M = 6.6 quake 4,800 kilometres away(12). The 2012 east Indian Ocean earthquake that had a moment magnitude of 8.6 is the largest strike-slip event ever recorded. Here we show that the rate of occurrence of remote M >= 5.5 earthquakes (>1,500 kilometres from the epicentre) increased nearly fivefold for six days after the 2012 event, and extended in magnitude to M <= 7. These global aftershocks were located along the four lobes of Love-wave radiation; all struck where the dynamic shear strain is calculated to exceed 10(-7) for at least 100 seconds during dynamic-wave passage. The other M >= 8.5 main-shocks during the past decade are thrusts; after these events, the global rate of occurrence of remote M >= 5.5 events increased by about one-third the rate following the 2012 shock and lasted for only two days, a weaker but possibly real increase. We suggest that the unprecedented delayed triggering power of the 2012 earthquake may have arisen because of its strike-slip source geometry or because the event struck at a time of an unusually low global earthquake rate, perhaps increasing the number of nucleation sites that were very close to failure.","Pollitz, Fred F.; Stein, Ross S.; Sevilgen, Volkan; Buergmann, Roland","Pollitz, FF; Stein, RS; Sevilgen, V; Burgmann, R",250,"[Pollitz, Fred F.; Stein, Ross S.] US Geol Survey, Menlo Pk, CA 94025 USA; [Sevilgen, Volkan] Seism Net, San Carlos, CA 94070 USA; [Buergmann, Roland] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature11504,Article,,fpollitz@usgs.gov,+,,,019IY,,,DENALI FAULT EARTHQUAKE; SEISMICITY; SUMATRA; CALIFORNIA; LANDERS; ALASKA; WAVES; SLIP,7419,NATURE,Nature,English,35,No,,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",11-Oct,6,LONDON,23023131.0,J,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2012,,"Pollitz, FF (reprint author), US Geol Survey, 345 Middlefield Rd,MS 977, Menlo Pk, CA 94025 USA.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,0028-0836,NATURE,70,The 11 April 2012 east Indian Ocean earthquake triggered large aftershocks worldwide,3,38,WOS:000309733300047,202,490,Multidisciplinary Sciences,71,roland,buergmann,14644,255,male,0,0,na,na,na,0,0,na,1.0,4,"(9345, 17929]",zaKntLEAAAAJ
100,"Ferroelectric thin films and superlattices are currently the subject of intensive research(1,2) because of the interest they raise for technological applications and also because their properties are of fundamental scientific importance(3-5). Ferroelectric superlattices(6) allow the tuning of the ferroelectric properties while maintaining perfect crystal structure and a coherent strain, even throughout relatively thick samples. This tuning is achieved in practice by adjusting both the strain(7-10), to enhance the polarization, and the composition, to interpolate between the properties of the combined compounds(11-15). Here we show that superlattices with very short periods possess a new form of interface coupling, based on rotational distortions, which gives rise to 'improper' ferroelectricity. These observations suggest an approach, based on interface engineering, to produce artificial materials with unique properties. By considering ferroelectric/paraelectric PbTiO3/SrTiO3 multilayers, we first show from first principles that the groundstate of the system is not purely ferroelectric but also primarily involves antiferrodistortive rotations of the oxygen atoms in a way compatible with improper ferroelectricity. We then demonstrate experimentally that, in contrast to pure PbTiO3 and SrTiO3 compounds, the multilayer system indeed behaves like a prototypical improper ferroelectric and exhibits a very large dielectric constant of epsilon(r)approximate to 600, which is also fairly temperature-independent. This behaviour, of practical interest for technological applications(16), is distinct from that of normal ferroelectrics, for which the dielectric constant is typically large but strongly evolves around the phase transition temperature and also differs from that of previously known improper ferroelectrics that exhibit a temperature-independent but small dielectric constant only.","Bousquet, Eric; Dawber, Matthew; Stucki, Nicolas; Lichtensteiger, Celine; Hermet, Patrick; Gariglio, Stefano; Triscone, Jean-Marc; Ghosez, Philippe","Bousquet, E; Dawber, M; Stucki, N; Lichtensteiger, C; Hermet, P; Gariglio, S; Triscone, JM; Ghosez, P",732,"[Bousquet, Eric; Hermet, Patrick; Ghosez, Philippe] Univ Liege, B-4000 Sart Tilman Par Liege, Belgium; [Dawber, Matthew; Stucki, Nicolas; Lichtensteiger, Celine; Gariglio, Stefano; Triscone, Jean-Marc] Univ Geneva, DPMC, CH-1211 Geneva 4, Switzerland",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature06817,Article,,matthew.dawber@stonybrook.edu; philippe.ghosez@ulg.ac.be,U4,,,285QY,Y,N,THIN-FILMS; POLARIZATION ENHANCEMENT; 1ST-PRINCIPLES; BATIO3; SRTIO3,7188,NATURE,Nature,English,35,No,,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",10-Apr,6,LONDON,18401406.0,J,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2008,"Ghosez, Philippe/F-1954-2014","Ghosez, P (reprint author), Univ Liege, Allee 6 Aout 17 B5, B-4000 Sart Tilman Par Liege, Belgium.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,0028-0836,NATURE,415,Improper ferroelectricity in perovskite oxide artificial superlattices,31,364,WOS:000254792500041,402,452,Multidisciplinary Sciences,417,philippe,ghosez,14131,605,male,0,0,na,na,na,0,0,na,0.99,4,"(9345, 17929]",bKwqdp4AAAAJ
101,"Rho is the essential RNA helicase that sets the borders between transcription units and adjusts transcriptional yield to translational needs in bacteria(1-3). Although Rho was the first termination factor to be discovered(4), the actual mechanism by which it reaches and disrupts the elongation complex (EC) is unknown. Here we show that the termination-committed Rho molecule associates with RNA polymerase (RNAP) throughout the transcription cycle; that is, it does not require the nascent transcript for initial binding. Moreover, the formation of the RNAP-Rho complex is crucial for termination. We show further that Rho-dependent termination is a two-step process that involves rapid EC inactivation (trap) and a relatively slow dissociation. Inactivation is the critical rate-limiting step that establishes the position of the termination site. The trap mechanism depends on the allosterically induced rearrangement of the RNAP catalytic centre by means of the evolutionarily conserved mobile trigger-loop domain, which is also required for EC dissociation. The key structural and functional similarities, which we found between Rho-dependent and intrinsic (Rho-independent) termination pathways, argue that the allosteric mechanism of termination is general and likely to be preserved for all cellular RNAPs throughout evolution.","Epshtein, Vitaly; Dutta, Dipak; Wade, Joseph; Nudler, Evgeny","Epshtein, V; Dutta, D; Wade, J; Nudler, E",245,"[Epshtein, Vitaly; Dutta, Dipak; Nudler, Evgeny] NYU, Sch Med, Dept Biochem, New York, NY 10016 USA; [Wade, Joseph] SUNY Albany, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Biomed Sci, Albany, NY 12201 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature08669,Article,,evgeny.nudler@nyumc.org,U136,National Institutes of Health [R01GM58750],"We thank I.

102,"Cytosine residues in mammalian DNA occur in five forms: cytosine (C), 5-methylcytosine (5mC), 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC), 5-formylcytosine (5fC) and 5-carboxylcytosine (5caC). The ten-eleven translocation (Tet) dioxygenases convert 5mC to 5hmC, 5fC and 5caC in three consecutive, Fe(II)- and alpha-ketoglutarate-dependent oxidation reactions(1-4). The Tet family of dioxygenases is widely distributed across the tree of life(5), including in the heterolobosean amoeboflagellate Naegleria gruberi. The genome of Naegleria(6) encodes homologues of mammalian DNA methyltransferase and Tet proteins(7). Here we study biochemically and structurally one of the Naegleria Tet-like proteins (NgTet1), which shares significant sequence conservation (approximately 14% identity or 39% similarity) with mammalian Tet1. Like mammalian Tet proteins, NgTet1 acts on 5mC and generates 5hmC, 5fC and 5caC. The crystal structure of NgTet1 in complex with DNA containing a 5mCpG site revealed that NgTet1 uses a base-flipping mechanism to access 5mC. The DNA is contacted from the minor groove and bent towards the major groove. The flipped 5mC is positioned in the active-site pocket with planar stacking contacts, Watson-Crick polar hydrogen bonds and van der Waals interactions specific for 5mC. The sequence conservation between NgTet1 and mammalian Tet1, including residues involved in structural integrity and functional significance, suggests structural conservation across phyla.","Hashimoto, Hideharu; Pais, June E.; Zhang, Xing; Saleh, Lana; Fu, Zheng-Qing; Dai, Nan; Correa, Ivan R., Jr.; Zheng, Yu; Cheng, Xiaodong","Hashimoto, H; Pais, JE; Zhang, X; Saleh, L; Fu, ZQ; Dai, N; Correa, IR; Zheng, Y; Cheng, XD",391,"[Hashimoto, Hideharu; Zhang, Xing; Cheng, Xiaodong] Emory Univ, Sch Med, Dept Biochem, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA; [Pais, June E.; Saleh, Lana; Dai, Nan; Correa, Ivan R., Jr.; Zheng, Yu] New England Biolabs Inc, Ipswich, MA 01938 USA; [Fu, Zheng-Qing] Univ Georgia, Dept Biochem & Mol Biol, Athens, GA 30602 USA; [Fu, Zheng-Qing] Argonne Natl Lab, Adv Photon Source, Sect 22, Argonne, IL 60439 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature12905,Article,1476-4687,zhengy@neb.com; xcheng@emory.edu,+,"National Institutes of Health [GM049245, GM095209, GM105132]","We thank R.

103,"Insulin receptor signalling has a central role in mammalian biology, regulating cellular metabolism, growth, division, differentiation and survival(1,2). Insulin resistance contributes to the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes mellitus and the onset of Alzheimer's disease(3); aberrant signalling occurs in diverse cancers, exacerbated by crosstalk with the homologous type 1 insulin-like growth factor receptor (IGF1R)(4). Despite more than three decades of investigation, the three-dimensional structure of the insulin-insulin receptor complex has proved elusive, confounded by the complexity of producing the receptor protein. Here we present the first view, to our knowledge, of the interaction of insulin with its primary binding site on the insulin receptor, on the basis of four crystal structures of insulin bound to truncated insulin receptor constructs. The direct interaction of insulin with the first leucine-rich-repeat domain (L1) of insulin receptor is seen to be sparse, the hormone instead engaging the insulin receptor carboxy-terminal alpha-chain (alpha CT) segment, which is itself remodelled on the face of L1 upon insulin binding. Contact between insulin and L1 is restricted to insulin B-chain residues. The aCT segment displaces the B-chain C-terminal beta-strand away from the hormone core, revealing the mechanism of a long-proposed conformational switch in insulin upon receptor engagement. This mode of hormone-receptor recognition is novel within the broader family of receptor tyrosine kinases(5). We support these findings by photo-crosslinking data that place the suggested interactions into the context of the holoreceptor and by isothermal titration calorimetry data that dissect the hormone-insulin receptor interface. Together, our findings provide an explanation for a wealth of biochemical data from the insulin receptor and IGF1R systems relevant to the design of therapeutic insulin analogues.","Menting, John G.; Whittaker, Jonathan; Margetts, Mai B.; Whittaker, Linda J.; Kong, Geoffrey K. -W.; Smith, Brian J.; Watson, Christopher J.; Zakova, Lenka; Kletvikova, Emilia; Jiracek, Jiri; Chan, Shu Jin; Steiner, Donald F.; Dodson, Guy G.; Brzozowski, Andrzej M.; Weiss, Michael A.; Ward, Colin W.; Lawrence, Michael C.","Menting, JG; Whittaker, J; Margetts, MB; Whittaker, LJ; Kong, GKW; Smith, BJ; Watson, CJ; Zakova, L; Kletvikova, E; Jiracek, J; Chan, SJ; Steiner, DF; Dodson, GG; Brzozowski, AM; Weiss, MA; Ward, CW; Lawrence, MC",241,"[Menting, John G.; Margetts, Mai B.; Kong, Geoffrey K. -W.; Smith, Brian J.; Ward, Colin W.; Lawrence, Michael C.] Walter & Eliza Hall Inst Med Res, Parkville, Vic 3052, Australia; [Whittaker, Jonathan; Whittaker, Linda J.; Weiss, Michael A.] Case Western Reserve Univ, Sch Med, Dept Biochem, Cleveland, OH 44106 USA; [Smith, Brian J.] La Trobe Univ, La Trobe Inst Mol Sci, Dept Chem, Melbourne, Vic 3086, Australia; [Watson, Christopher J.; Dodson, Guy G.; Brzozowski, Andrzej M.] Univ York, Dept Chem, York Struct Biol Lab, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England; [Zakova, Lenka; Kletvikova, Emilia; Jiracek, Jiri] Acad Sci Czech Republic, Inst Organ Chem & Biochem, Vvi, CR-16610 Prague, Czech Republic; [Chan, Shu Jin; Steiner, Donald F.] Univ Chicago, Dept Med, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Lawrence, Michael C.] Univ Melbourne, Dept Med Biol, Parkville, Vic 3010, Australia",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature11781,Article,,michael.weiss@case.edu; lawrence@wehi.edu.au,U276,"Australian National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) [516729, 575539, 1005896]; Hazel and Pip Appel Fund; NHMRC [361646]; Victorian State Government; NIH [DK40949, DK13914, DK20595]; American Diabetes Association [1-11INI-31]; Grant Agency of the Czech Republic [P207/11/P430]; Research Project of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic [RVO: 61388963]; BBSRC; UoY Research Priming Fund","This Letter is dedicated to our co-author, the late Guy Dodson, in recognition of his lifetime contribution to the study of the structure of insulin.

104,"DNA repair by homologous recombination(1) is highly suppressed in G1 cells(2,3) to ensure that mitotic recombination occurs solely between sister chromatids(4). Although many homologous recombination factors are cell-cycle regulated, the identity of the events that are both necessary and sufficient to suppress recombination in G1 cells is unknown. Here we report that the cell cycle controls the interaction of BRCA1 with PALB2-BRCA2 to constrain BRCA2 function to the S/G2 phases in human cells. We found that the BRCA1-interaction site on PALB2 is targeted by an E3 ubiquitin ligase composed of KEAP1, a PALB2-interacting protein(5), in complex with cullin-3 (CUL3)-RBX1 (ref.6). PALB2 ubiquitylation suppresses its interaction with BRCA1 and is counteracted by the deubiquitylase USP11, which is itself under cell cycle control. Restoration of the BRCA1-PALB2 interaction combined with the activation of DNA-end resection is sufficient to induce homologous recombination in G1, as measured by RAD51 recruitment, unscheduled DNA synthesis and a CRISPR-Cas9-based gene-targeting assay. We conclude that the mechanism prohibiting homologous recombination in G1 minimally consists of the suppression of DNA-end resection coupled with a multi-step block of the recruitment of BRCA2 to DNA damage sites that involves the inhibition of BRCA1-PALB2-BRCA2 complex assembly. We speculate that the ability to induce homologous recombination in G1 cells with defined factors could spur the development of gene-targeting applications in non-dividing cells.","Orthwein, Alexandre; Noordermeer, Sylvie M.; Wilson, Marcus D.; Landry, Sebastien; Enchev, Radoslav I.; Sherker, Alana; Munro, Meagan; Pinder, Jordan; Salsman, Jayme; Dellaire, Graham; Xia, Bing; Peter, Matthias; Durocher, Daniel","Orthwein, A; Noordermeer, SM; Wilson, MD; Landry, S; Enchev, RI; Sherker, A; Munro, M; Pinder, J; Salsman, J; Dellaire, G; Xia, B; Peter, M; Durocher, D",422,"[Orthwein, Alexandre; Noordermeer, Sylvie M.; Wilson, Marcus D.; Landry, Sebastien; Sherker, Alana; Munro, Meagan; Durocher, Daniel] Mt Sinai Hosp, Lunenfeld Tanenbaum Res Inst, Toronto, ON M5G 1X5, Canada; [Enchev, Radoslav I.; Peter, Matthias] ETH, Inst Biochem, Dept Biol, CH-8093 Zurich, Switzerland; [Sherker, Alana; Durocher, Daniel] Univ Toronto, Dept Mol Genet, Toronto, ON M5S 3E1, Canada; [Pinder, Jordan; Salsman, Jayme; Dellaire, Graham] Dalhousie Univ, Dept Pathol, Halifax, NS B3H 4R2, Canada; [Pinder, Jordan; Salsman, Jayme; Dellaire, Graham] Dalhousie Univ, Dept Biochem & Mol Biol, Halifax, NS B3H 4R2, Canada; [Xia, Bing] Rutgers State Univ, Rutgers Canc Inst New Jersey, Dept Radiat Oncol, New Brunswick, NJ 08901 USA; [Xia, Bing] Rutgers State Univ, Robert Wood Johnson Med Sch, New Brunswick, NJ 08901 USA",,,11/19/17,,10.1038/nature16142,Article,1476-4687,durocher@lunenfeld.ca,+,"Dutch Cancer Society (KWF); Human Frontier Science Program fellowship; Ontario Graduate Scholarship; Marie Curie postdoctoral fellowship; Beatrice Hunter Cancer Research Institute (BHCRI); Harvey Graham Cancer Research Fund as part of the Terry Fox Foundation Strategic Health Research Training Program in Cancer Research at the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR); Krembil Foundation; CIHR [FDN143343, MOP84260]","We are grateful to R.

105,"Cryptic variation is caused by the robustness of phenotypes to mutations(1). Cryptic variation has no effect on phenotypes in a given genetic or environmental background, but it can have effects after mutations or environmental change(2-5). Because evolutionary adaptation by natural selection requires phenotypic variation, phenotypically revealed cryptic genetic variation may facilitate evolutionary adaptation(6-8). This is possible if the cryptic variation happens to be pre-adapted, or ""exapted""(9), to a new environment, and is thus advantageous once revealed. However, this facilitating role for cryptic variation has not been proven, partly because most pertinent work focuses on complex phenotypes of whole organisms whose genetic basis is incompletely understood. Here we show that populations of RNA enzymes with accumulated cryptic variation adapt more rapidly to a new substrate than a population without cryptic variation. A detailed analysis of our evolving RNA populations in genotype space shows that cryptic variation allows a population to explore new genotypes that become adaptive only in a new environment. Our observations show that cryptic variation contains new genotypes pre-adapted to a changed environment.

106,"Maintenance of the blood system is dependent on dormant haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) with long-term self-renewal capacity. After injury these cells are induced to proliferate to quickly reestablish homeostasis(1). The signalling molecules promoting the exit of HSCs out of the dormant stage remain largely unknown. Here we show that in response to treatment of mice with interferon-alpha (IFN alpha), HSCs efficiently exit G(0) and enter an active cell cycle. HSCs respond to IFN alpha treatment by the increased phosphorylation of STAT1 and PKB/Akt (also known as AKT1), the expression of IFN alpha target genes, and the upregulation of stem cell antigen-1 (Sca-1, also known as LY6A). HSCs lacking the IFN alpha/beta receptor (IFNAR)(2), STAT1 (ref. 3) or Sca-1 (ref. 4) are insensitive to IFN alpha stimulation, demonstrating that STAT1 and Sca-1 mediate IFN alpha-induced HSC proliferation. Although dormant HSCs are resistant to the anti-proliferative chemotherapeutic agent 5-fluoro-uracil(1,5), HSCs pre-treated (primed) with IFN alpha and thus induced to proliferate are efficiently eliminated by 5-fluoro-uracil exposure in vivo. Conversely, HSCs chronically activated by IFN alpha are functionally compromised and are rapidly out-competed by non-activatable Ifnar(-/-) cells in competitive repopulation assays. Whereas chronic activation of the IFN alpha pathway in HSCs impairs their function, acute IFN alpha treatment promotes the proliferation of dormant HSCs in vivo. These data may help to clarify the so far unexplained clinical effects of IFN alpha on leukaemic cells(6,7), and raise the possibility for new applications of type I interferons to target cancer stem cells(8).","Essers, Marieke A.

107,"The Trivers-Willard theory(1) proposes that the sex ratio of offspring should vary with maternal condition when it has sex-specific influences on offspring fitness. In particular, mothers in good condition in polygynous and dimorphic species are predicted to produce an excess of sons, whereas mothers in poor condition should do the opposite. Despite the elegance of the theory, support for it has been limited(2,3). Here we extend and generalize the Trivers-Willard theory to explain the disparity between predictions and observations of offspring sex ratio. In polygynous species, males typically have higher mortality rates(4), different age-specific reproductive schedules and more risk-prone life history tactics than females; however, these differences are not currently incorporated into the Trivers-Willard theory. Using two-sex models parameterized with data from free-living mammal populations with contrasting levels of sex differences in demography, we demonstrate how sex differences in life history traits over the entire lifespan can lead to a wide range of sex allocation tactics, and show that correlations between maternal condition and offspring sex ratio alone are insufficient to conclude that mothers adaptively adjust offspring sex ratio.","Schindler, Susanne; Gaillard, Jean-Michel; Gruening, Andre; Neuhaus, Peter; Traill, Lochran W.; Tuljapurkar, Shripad; Coulson, Tim","Schindler, S; Gaillard, JM; Gruning, A; Neuhaus, P; Traill, LW; Tuljapurkar, S; Coulson, T",249,"[Schindler, Susanne; Coulson, Tim] Univ Oxford, Dept Zool, Oxford OX1 3PS, England; [Gaillard, Jean-Michel] Univ Lyon 1, UMR 5558, Lab Biometrie & Biol Evolut, F-69622 Villeurbanne, France; [Gruening, Andre] Univ Surrey, Dept Comp Sci, Guildford GU2 7XH, Surrey, England; [Neuhaus, Peter] Univ Calgary, Dept Biol Sci, Calgary, AB T2N 1N4, Canada; [Traill, Lochran W.] Univ Witwatersrand, Sch Anim Plant & Environm Sci, ZA-2050 Johannesburg, South Africa; [Tuljapurkar, Shripad] Stanford Univ, Dept Biol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA",,,11/19/17,,10.1038/nature14968,Article,1476-4687,Susanne.Schindler@zoo.ox.ac.uk,+,ERC Advanced Grant; Swiss National Science Foundation [SNF 3100AO-109816]; European Commission (Marie Curie Fellowship) [254442]; Carnegie Corporation of New York [B8749.R01],"We thank Y.

108,"Females often mate with several males before producing offspring(1). Field studies of vertebrates suggest, and laboratory experiments on invertebrates confirm, that even when males provide no material benefits, polyandry can enhance offspring survival(2,3). This enhancement is widely attributed to genetic benefits that arise whenever paternity is biased towards males that sire more viable offspring(1,4,5). Field studies suggest that post-mating sexual selection biases fertilization towards genetically more compatible males(6,7) and one controlled experiment has shown that, when females mate with close kin, polyandry reduces the relative number of inbred offspring(8). Another potential genetic benefit of polyandry is that it increases offspring survival because males with more competitive ejaculates sire more viable offspring(9). Surprisingly, however, there is no unequivocal evidence for this process(10). Here, by experimentally assigning mates to females, we show that polyandry greatly increases offspring survival in the Australian marsupial Antechinus stuartii. DNA profiling shows that males that gain high paternity under sperm competition sire offspring that are more viable. This beneficial effect occurs in both the laboratory and the wild. Crucially, there are no confounding non-genetic maternal effects that could arise if polyandry increases female investment in a particular reproductive event(10) because A. stuartii is effectively semelparous. Our results therefore show that polyandry improves female lifetime fitness in nature. The threefold increase in offspring survival is not negated by a decline in maternal lifespan and is too large to be offset by an equivalent decline in the reproductive performance of surviving offspring.","Fisher, Diana O.; Double, Michael C.; Blomberg, Simon P.; Jennions, Michael D.; Cockburn, Andrew","Fisher, DO; Double, MC; Blomberg, SP; Jennions, MD; Cockburn, A",89,"Australian Natl Univ, Sch Bot & Zool, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia; Australian Natl Univ, Ctr Resource & Environm Studies, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature05206,Article,,diana.fisher@anu.edu.au,92,,,100WS,,,ANTECHINUS-STUARTII; GENETIC BENEFITS; SPERM SELECTION; PATERNITY; SUCCESS; EVOLUTION; POPULATION; CRICKET; AGILIS; MATES,7115,NATURE,Nature,English,30,No,"Fisher, Diana/0000-0002-4017-3710; Jennions, Michael/0000-0001-9221-2788; Blomberg, Simon/0000-0003-1062-0839","MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",2-Nov,4,LONDON,17080089.0,J,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2006,"Fisher, Diana/C-1324-2010; Jennions, Michael/C-7560-2009; Blomberg, Simon/B-7613-2008","Fisher, DO (reprint author), Australian Natl Univ, Sch Bot & Zool, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,0028-0836,NATURE,131,Post-mating sexual selection increases lifetime fitness of polyandrous females in the wild,5,72,WOS:000241701500051,79,444,Multidisciplinary Sciences,132,andrew,cockburn,9443,5168,male,1,1,321359,88600,Andrew Cockburn,1,1,Andrew Cockburn,1.0,4,"(9345, 17929]",HzupDnMAAAAJ
109,"Measles virus is an aerosol-transmitted virus that affects more than 10 million children each year and accounts for approximately 120,000 deaths(1,2). Although it was long believed to replicate in the respiratory epithelium before disseminating, it was recently shown to infect initially macrophages and dendritic cells of the airways using signalling lymphocytic activation molecule family member 1 (SLAMF1; also called CD150) as a receptor(3-6). These cells then cross the respiratory epithelium and transport the infection to lymphatic organs where measles virus replicates vigorously(7). How and where the virus crosses back into the airways has remained unknown. On the basis of functional analyses of surface proteins preferentially expressed on virus-permissive human epithelial cell lines, here we identify nectin-4 (ref. 8; also called poliovirus-receptor-like-4 (PVRL4)) as a candidate host exit receptor. This adherens junction protein of the immunoglobulin superfamily interacts with the viral attachment protein with high affinity through its membrane-distal domain. Nectin-4 sustains measles virus entry and non-cytopathic lateral spread in well-differentiated primary human airway epithelial sheets infected basolaterally. It is downregulated in infected epithelial cells, including those of macaque tracheae. Although other viruses use receptors to enter hosts or transit through their epithelial barriers, we suggest that measles virus targets nectin-4 to emerge in the airways. Nectin-4 is a cellular marker of several types of cancer(9-11), which has implications for ongoing measles-virus-based clinical trials of oncolysis(12).","Muhlebach, Michael D.; Mateo, Mathieu; Sinn, Patrick L.; Pruefer, Steffen; Uhlig, Katharina M.; Leonard, Vincent H.

110,"Mutations that deregulate Notch1 and Ras/phosphoinositide 3 kinase (PI3K)/Akt signalling are prevalent in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (T-ALL), and often coexist. Here we show that the PI3K inhibitor GDC-0941 is active against primary T-ALLs from wild-type and Kras(G12D) mice, and addition of the MEK inhibitor PD0325901 increases its efficacy. Mice invariably relapsed after treatment with drug-resistant clones, most of which unexpectedly had reduced levels of activated Notch1 protein, downregulated many Notch1 target genes, and exhibited cross-resistance to gamma-secretase inhibitors. Multiple resistant primary T-ALLs that emerged in vivo did not contain somatic Notch1 mutations present in the parental leukaemia. Importantly, resistant clones upregulated PI3K signalling. Consistent with these data, inhibiting Notch1 activated the PI3K pathway, providing a likely mechanism for selection against oncogenic Notch1 signalling. These studies validate PI3K as a therapeutic target in T-ALL and raise the unexpected possibility that dual inhibition of PI3K and Notch1 signalling could promote drug resistance in T-ALL.","Dail, Monique; Wong, Jason; Lawrence, Jessica; O'Connor, Daniel; Nakitandwe, Joy; Chen, Shann-Ching; Xu, Jin; Lee, Leslie B.; Akagi, Keiko; Li, Qing; Aster, Jon C.; Pear, Warren S.; Downing, James R.; Sampath, Deepak; Shannon, Kevin","Dail, M; Wong, J; Lawrence, J; O'Connor, D; Nakitandwe, J; Chen, SC; Xu, J; Lee, LB; Akagi, K; Li, Q; Aster, JC; Pear, WS; Downing, JR; Sampath, D; Shannon, K",512,"[Dail, Monique; Wong, Jason; Lawrence, Jessica; O'Connor, Daniel; Xu, Jin; Shannon, Kevin] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Pediat, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; [Dail, Monique; Wong, Jason; Lawrence, Jessica; O'Connor, Daniel; Xu, Jin; Shannon, Kevin] Univ Calif San Francisco, Benniof Childrens Hosp, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; [Nakitandwe, Joy; Chen, Shann-Ching; Downing, James R.] St Jude Childrens Res Hosp, Dept Pathol, Memphis, TN 38105 USA; [Lee, Leslie B.; Sampath, Deepak] Genentech Inc, Dept Translat Oncol, San Francisco, CA 94080 USA; [Akagi, Keiko] Ohio State Univ, Dept Mol Virol Immunol & Med Genet, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Li, Qing] Univ Michigan, Dept Med, Div Haematol Oncol, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Aster, Jon C.] Harvard Univ, Brigham & Womens Hosp, Sch Med, Dept Pathol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Pear, Warren S.] Univ Penn, Abramson Family Canc Res Inst, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Pear, Warren S.] Univ Penn, Dept Pathol & Lab Med, Perelman Sch Med, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature13495,Article,1476-4687,shannonk@peds.ucsf.edu,+,"William Lawrence and Blanche Hughes Foundation; Specialized Center of Research (SCOR) from the Leukaemia and Lymphoma Society of America [7019, 7703]; National Institutes of Health [R37 CA72614, R01 CA180037, K99 CA157950, K08 CA134649, P01 CA119070]; ALSAC of St. Jude Children's Research Hospital; Ohio Supercomputer Center [PAS0425]; Ohio Cancer Research Associate [GRT00024299]; American Cancer Society (ACS)","This work was supported by grants from the William Lawrence and Blanche Hughes Foundation to J.C.A. and K.

111,"The molecular clock maintains energy constancy by producing circadian oscillations of rate-limiting enzymes involved in tissue metabolism across the day and night(1-3). During periods of feeding, pancreatic islets secrete insulin to maintain glucose homeostasis, and although rhythmic control of insulin release is recognized to be dysregulated in humans with diabetes(4), it is not known how the circadian clock may affect this process. Here we show that pancreatic islets possess self-sustained circadian gene and protein oscillations of the transcription factors CLOCK and BMAL1. The phase of oscillation of islet genes involved in growth, glucose metabolism and insulin signalling is delayed in circadian mutant mice, and both Clock(5,6) and Bmal1(7) (also called Arntl) mutants show impaired glucose tolerance, reduced insulin secretion and defects in size and proliferation of pancreatic islets that worsen with age. Clock disruption leads to transcriptome-wide alterations in the expression of islet genes involved in growth, survival and synaptic vesicle assembly. Notably, conditional ablation of the pancreatic clock causes diabetes mellitus due to defective beta-cell function at the very latest stage of stimulus-secretion coupling. These results demonstrate a role for the beta-cell clock in coordinating insulin secretion with the sleep-wake cycle, and reveal that ablation of the pancreatic clock can trigger the onset of diabetes mellitus.","Marcheva, Biliana; Ramsey, Kathryn Moynihan; Buhr, Ethan D.; Kobayashi, Yumiko; Su, Hong; Ko, Caroline H.; Ivanova, Ganka; Omura, Chiaki; Mo, Shelley; Vitaterna, Martha H.; Lopez, James P.; Philipson, Louis H.; Bradfield, Christopher A.; Crosby, Seth D.; JeBailey, Lellean; Wang, Xiaozhong; Takahashi, Joseph S.; Bass, Joseph","Marcheva, B; Ramsey, KM; Buhr, ED; Kobayashi, Y; Su, H; Ko, CH; Ivanova, G; Omura, C; Mo, S; Vitaterna, MH; Lopez, JP; Philipson, LH; Bradfield, CA; Crosby, SD; JeBailey, L; Wang, XZ; Takahashi, JS; Bass, J",627,"[Marcheva, Biliana; Ramsey, Kathryn Moynihan; Kobayashi, Yumiko; Ivanova, Ganka; Omura, Chiaki; Bass, Joseph] Northwestern Univ, Dept Med, Feinberg Sch Med, Chicago, IL 60611 USA; [Marcheva, Biliana; Ramsey, Kathryn Moynihan; Buhr, Ethan D.; Kobayashi, Yumiko; Ko, Caroline H.; Ivanova, Ganka; Omura, Chiaki; Bass, Joseph] Northwestern Univ, Dept Neurobiol & Physiol, Evanston, IL 60208 USA; [Su, Hong; Wang, Xiaozhong] Northwestern Univ, Dept Biochem Mol Biol & Cell Biol, Evanston, IL 60208 USA; [Mo, Shelley] Northwestern Univ, Weinberg Coll Arts & Sci, Evanston, IL 60208 USA; [Vitaterna, Martha H.; Bass, Joseph] Northwestern Univ, Ctr Sleep & Circadian Biol, Evanston, IL 60208 USA; [Lopez, James P.; Philipson, Louis H.] Univ Chicago, Dept Med, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Bradfield, Christopher A.] Univ Wisconsin, Sch Med & Publ Hlth, McArdle Lab Canc Res, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Crosby, Seth D.] Washington Univ, Sch Med, Dept Genet, St Louis, MO 63108 USA; [JeBailey, Lellean] GeneGo Inc, St Joseph, MI 49085 USA; [Takahashi, Joseph S.] Univ Texas SW Med Ctr Dallas, Dept Neurosci, Dallas, TX 75390 USA; [Takahashi, Joseph S.] Univ Texas SW Med Ctr Dallas, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Dallas, TX 75390 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature09253,Article,,j-bass@northwestern.edu,631,National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases; National Institutes of Health [R37-ES-005703]; Chicago Biomedical Consortium; Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation; National Institute of Mental Health,"We thank F.

112,"In termination of protein synthesis, the bacterial release factors RF1 and RF2 bind to the ribosome through specific recognition of messenger RNA stop codons and trigger hydrolysis of the bond between the nascent polypeptide and the transfer RNA at the peptidyl-tRNA site, thereby releasing the newly synthesized protein. The release factors are highly specific for a U in the first stop-codon position 1 and recognize different combinations of purines in the second and third positions, with RF1 reading UAA and UAG and RF2 reading UAA and UGA. With recently determined crystal structures of termination complexes(2-4), it has become possible to decipher the energetics of stop-codon reading by computational analysis and to clarify the origin of the high release-factor binding accuracy. Here we report molecular dynamics free-energy calculations on different cognate and non-cognate termination complexes. The simulations quantitatively explain the basic principles of decoding in all three codon positions and reveal the key elements responsible for specificity of the release factors. The overall reading mechanism involves hitherto unidentified interactions and recognition switches that cannot be described in terms of a tripeptide anticodon model. Further simulations of complexes with tRNA(Trp), the tRNA recognizing the triplet codon for Trp, explain the observation of a 'leaky' stop codon 5 and highlight the fundamentally different third position reading by RF2, which leads to a high stop-codon specificity with strong discrimination against the Trp codon. The simulations clearly illustrate the versatility of codon reading by protein, which goes far beyond tRNA mimicry.","Sund, Johan; Ander, Martin; Aqvist, Johan","Sund, J; Ander, M; Aqvist, J",947,"[Sund, Johan; Ander, Martin; Aqvist, Johan] Uppsala Univ, Biomed Ctr, Dept Cell & Mol Biol, SE-75124 Uppsala, Sweden",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature09082,Article,,aqvist@xray.bmc.uu.se,U12,Swedish Research Council,"Support from the Swedish Research Council is gratefully acknowledged.

113,"Quantum point contacts are narrow, one-dimensional constrictions usually patterned in a two-dimensional electron system, for example by applying voltages to local gates. The linear conductance of a point contact, when measured as function of its channel width, is quantized(1-3) in units of G(Q) = 2e(2)/h, where e is the electron charge and h is Planck's constant. However, the conductance also has an unexpected shoulder at similar to 0.7 G(Q), known as the '0.7-anomaly'(4-12), whose origin is still subject to debate(11-21). Proposed theoretical explanations have invoked spontaneous spin polarization(4,17), ferromagnetic spin coupling(19), the formation of a quasi-bound state leading to the Kondo effect(13,14), Wigner crystallization(16,20) and various treatments of inelastic scattering(18,21). However, explicit calculations that fully reproduce the various experimental observations in the regime of the 0.7-anomaly, including the zero-bias peak that typically accompanies it(6,9-11), are still lacking. Here we offer a detailed microscopic explanation for both the 0.7-anomaly and the zero-bias peak: their common origin is a smeared van Hove singularity in the local density of states at the bottom of the lowest one-dimensional subband of the point contact, which causes an anomalous enhancement in the Hartree potential barrier, the magnetic spin susceptibility and the inelastic scattering rate. We find good qualitative agreement between theoretical calculations and experimental results on the dependence of the conductance on gate voltage, magnetic field, temperature, source-drain voltage (including the zero-bias peak) and interaction strength. We also clarify how the low-energy scale governing the 0.7-anomaly depends on gate voltage and interactions. For low energies, we predict and observe Fermi-liquid behaviour similar to that associated with the Kondo effect in quantum dots(22). At high energies, however, the similarities between the 0.7-anomaly and the Kondo effect end.","Bauer, Florian; Heyder, Jan; Schubert, Enrico; Borowsky, David; Taubert, Daniela; Bruognolo, Benedikt; Schuh, Dieter; Wegscheider, Werner; von Delft, Jan; Ludwig, Stefan","Bauer, F; Heyder, J; Schubert, E; Borowsky, D; Taubert, D; Bruognolo, B; Schuh, D; Wegscheider, W; von Delft, J; Ludwig, S",73,"[Bauer, Florian; Heyder, Jan; Schubert, Enrico; Borowsky, David; Taubert, Daniela; Bruognolo, Benedikt; von Delft, Jan; Ludwig, Stefan] Univ Munich, Ctr NanoSci, D-80539 Munich, Germany; [Bauer, Florian; Heyder, Jan; Schubert, Enrico; Borowsky, David; Taubert, Daniela; Bruognolo, Benedikt; von Delft, Jan; Ludwig, Stefan] Univ Munich, Fak Phys, D-80539 Munich, Germany; [Bauer, Florian; Heyder, Jan; Bruognolo, Benedikt; von Delft, Jan] Univ Munich, Arnold Sommerfeld Ctr Theoret Phys, D-80333 Munich, Germany; [Schuh, Dieter] Univ Regensburg, Inst Angew Phys, D-93040 Regensburg, Germany; [Wegscheider, Werner] ETH, Solid State Phys Lab, CH-8093 Zurich, Switzerland",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature12421,Article,1476-4687,vondelft@lmu.de; ludwig@lmu.de,78,"DFG [SFB-631, SFB-TR12, De730/3-2, De730/4-1, De730/4-2, De730/4-3, HO 4687/1-3, LU819/4-1]; Cluster of Excellence Nanosystems Initiative Munich; Center for NanoScience; US National Science Foundation [NSF PHY05-51164]; DFG","We thank B.

114,"To tackle incongruence, the topological conflict between different gene trees, phylogenomic studies couple concatenation with practices such as rogue taxon removal or the use of slowly evolving genes. Phylogenomic analysis of 1,070 orthologues from 23 yeast genomes identified 1,070 distinct gene trees, which were all incongruent with the phylogeny inferred from concatenation. Incongruence severity increased for shorter internodes located deeper in the phylogeny. Notably, whereas most practices had little or negative impact on the yeast phylogeny, the use of genes or internodes with high average internode support significantly improved the robustness of inference. We obtained similar results in analyses of vertebrate and metazoan phylogenomic data sets. These results question the exclusive reliance on concatenation and associated practices, and argue that selecting genes with strong phylogenetic signals and demonstrating the absence of significant incongruence are essential for accurately reconstructing ancient divergences.","Salichos, Leonidas; Rokas, Antonis","Salichos, L; Rokas, A",327,"[Salichos, Leonidas; Rokas, Antonis] Vanderbilt Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Nashville, TN 37235 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature12130,Article,,antonis.rokas@vanderbilt.edu,+,National Science Foundation [DEB-0844968],We thank K.

115,"Magnetohydrodynamic turbulence is important in many high-energy astrophysical systems, where instabilities can amplify the local magnetic field over very short timescales(1,2). Specifically, the magnetorotational instability and dynamo action(3-6) have been suggested as a mechanism for the growth of magnetar-strength magnetic fields (of 10(15) gauss and above) and for powering the explosion(7-10) of a rotating massive star(11,12). Such stars are candidate progenitors of type Ic-bl hypernovae(13,14), which make up all supernovae that are connected to long gamma-ray bursts(15,16). The magnetorotational instability has been studied with local high-resolution shearing-box simulations in three dimensions(17-19), and with global two-dimensional simulations(20), but it is not known whether turbulence driven by this instability can result in the creation of a large-scale, ordered and dynamically relevant field. Here we report results from global, three-dimensional, general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamic turbulence simulations. We show that hydromagnetic turbulence in rapidly rotating protoneutron stars produces an inverse cascade of energy. We find a large-scale, ordered toroidal field that is consistent with the formation of bipolar magnetorotationally driven outflows. Our results demonstrate that rapidly rotating massive stars are plausible progenitors for both type Ic-bl supernovae(13,21,22) and long gamma-ray bursts, and provide a viable mechanism for the formation of magnetars(23,24). Moreover, our findings suggest that rapidly rotating massive stars might lie behind potentially magnetar-powered superluminous supernovae(25,26).","Moesta, Philipp; Ott, Christian D.; Radice, David; Roberts, Luke F.; Schnetter, Erik; Haas, Roland","Mosta, P; Ott, CD; Radice, D; Roberts, LF; Schnetter, E; Haas, R",376,"[Moesta, Philipp; Ott, Christian D.; Radice, David; Roberts, Luke F.] CALTECH, Walter Burke Inst Theoret Phys, TAPIR, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA; [Moesta, Philipp] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Astron, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Schnetter, Erik] Perimeter Inst Theoret Phys, Waterloo, ON N2L 2Y5, Canada; [Schnetter, Erik] Univ Guelph, Dept Phys, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada; [Schnetter, Erik] Louisiana State Univ, Ctr Computat & Technol, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA; [Haas, Roland] Max Planck Inst Gravitat Phys, D-14476 Potsdam, Germany",,,11/19/17,,10.1038/nature15755,Article,1476-4687,pmoesta@berkeley.edu,+,"National Science Foundation (NSF) [AST-1212170, PHY-1151197, OCI-0905046]; NASA [PF5-160140, PF3-140114]; National Science and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC); Sherman Fairchild Foundation","We thank S.

116,"Antigen-presenting molecules, encoded by the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) and CD1 family, bind peptide- and lipid-based antigens, respectively, for recognition by T cells. Mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells are an abundant population of innate-like T cells in humans that are activated by an antigen(s) bound to the MHC class I-like molecule MR1. Although the identity of MR1-restricted antigen(s) is unknown, it is present in numerous bacteria and yeast. Here we show that the structure and chemistry within the antigen-binding cleft of MR1 is distinct from the MHC and CD1 families. MR1 is ideally suited to bind ligands originating from vitamin metabolites. The structure of MR1 in complex with 6-formyl pterin, a folic acid (vitamin B9) metabolite, shows the pterin ring sequestered within MR1. Furthermore, we characterize related MR1-restricted vitamin derivatives, originating from the bacterial riboflavin (vitamin B2) biosynthetic pathway, which specifically and potently activate MAIT cells. Accordingly, we show that metabolites of vitamin B represent a class of antigen that are presented by MR1 for MAIT-cell immunosurveillance. As many vitamin biosynthetic pathways are unique to bacteria and yeast, our data suggest that MAIT cells use these metabolites to detect microbial infection.","Kjer-Nielsen, Lars; Patel, Onisha; Corbett, Alexandra J.; Le Nours, Jerome; Meehan, Bronwyn; Liu, Ligong; Bhati, Mugdha; Chen, Zhenjun; Kostenko, Lyudmila; Reantragoon, Rangsima; Williamson, Nicholas A.; Purcell, Anthony W.; Dudek, Nadine L.; McConville, Malcolm J.; O'Hair, Richard A.

117,"Magma fluxes regulate the planetary thermal budget, the growth of continents and the frequency and magnitude of volcanic eruptions, and play a part in the genesis and size of magmatic ore deposits(1-4). However, because a large fraction of the magma produced on the Earth does not erupt at the surface(2,5), determinations of magma fluxes are rare and this compromises our ability to establish a link between global heat transfer and large-scale geological processes. Here we show that age distributions of zircons, a mineral often present in crustal magmatic rocks(6), in combination with thermal modelling, provide an accurate means of retrieving magma fluxes. The characteristics of zircon age populations vary significantly and systematically as a function of the flux and total volume of magma accumulated in the Earth's crust. Our approach produces results that are consistent with independent determinations of magma fluxes and volumes of magmatic systems. Analysis of existing age population data sets using our method suggests that porphyry-type deposits, plutons and large eruptions each require magma input over different timescales at different characteristic average fluxes. We anticipate that more extensive and complete magma flux data sets will serve to clarify the control that the global heat flux exerts on the frequency of geological events such as volcanic eruptions, and to determine the main factors controlling the distribution of resources on our planet.","Caricchi, Luca; Simpson, Guy; Schaltegger, Urs","Caricchi, L; Simpson, G; Schaltegger, U",457,"[Caricchi, Luca; Simpson, Guy; Schaltegger, Urs] Univ Geneva, Sect Earth & Environm Sci, CH-1205 Geneva, Switzerland",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature13532,Article,1476-4687,luca.caricchi@unige.ch,+,University of Geneva; Swiss National Science Foundation,"We thank C.

118,"Replication fork stalling can promote genomic instability, predisposing to cancer and other diseases(1-3). Stalled replication forks may be processed by sister chromatid recombination (SCR), generating error-free or error-prone homologous recombination (HR) outcomes(4-8). In mammalian cells, a long-standing hypothesis proposes that the major hereditary breast/ovarian cancer predisposition gene products, BRCA1 and BRCA2, control HR/SCR at stalled replication forks(9). Although BRCA1 and BRCA2 affect replication fork processing(10-12), direct evidence that BRCA gene products regulate homologous recombination at stalled chromosomal replication forks is lacking, due to a dearth of tools for studying this process. Here we report that the Escherichia coli Tus/Ter complex(13-16) can be engineered to induce site-specific replication fork stalling and chromosomal HR/SCR in mouse cells. Tus/Ter-induced homologous recombination entails processing of bidirectionally arrested forks. We find that the Brca1 carboxy (C)-terminal tandem BRCT repeat and regions of Brca1 encoded by exon 11-two Brca1 elements implicated in tumour suppression-control Tus/Ter-induced homologous recombination. Inactivation of either Brca1 or Brca2 increases the absolute frequency of 'long-tract' gene conversions at Tus/Ter-stalled forks, an outcome not observed in response to a site-specific endonuclease-mediated chromosomal double-strand break. Therefore, homologous recombination at stalled forks is regulated differently from homologous recombination at double-strand breaks arising independently of a replication fork. We propose that aberrant long-tract homologous recombination at stalled replication forks contributes to genomic instability and breast/ovarian cancer predisposition in BRCA mutant cells.","Willis, Nicholas A.; Chandramouly, Gurushankar; Huang, Bin; Kwok, Amy; Follonier, Cindy; Deng, Chuxia; Scully, Ralph","Willis, NA; Chandramouly, G; Huang, B; Kwok, A; Follonier, C; Deng, CX; Scully, R",556,"[Willis, Nicholas A.; Chandramouly, Gurushankar; Huang, Bin; Kwok, Amy; Scully, Ralph] Beth Israel Deaconess Med Ctr, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Willis, Nicholas A.; Chandramouly, Gurushankar; Huang, Bin; Kwok, Amy; Scully, Ralph] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Follonier, Cindy] Princeton Univ, Lewis Thomas Lab 101, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Deng, Chuxia] NIDDK, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20814 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature13295,Article,1476-4687,rscully@bidmc.harvard.edu,+,"NIH [R01CA095175, R01GM073894, R21CA144017, R37GM26938]; NIH/NCI [5T32CA081156]; ACS [PF-12-248-01-DMC]","We thank B.

119,"Biodiversity is essential to the viability of ecological systems. Species diversity in ecosystems is promoted by cyclic, non-hierarchical interactions among competing populations. Central features of such non-transitive relations are represented by the 'rock-paper-scissors' game, in which rock crushes scissors, scissors cut paper, and paper wraps rock. In combination with spatial dispersal of static populations, this type of competition results in the stable coexistence of all species and the long-term maintenance of biodiversity(1-5). However, population mobility is a central feature of real ecosystems: animals migrate, bacteria run and tumble. Here, we observe a critical influence of mobility on species diversity. When mobility exceeds a certain value, biodiversity is jeopardized and lost. In contrast, below this critical threshold all subpopulations coexist and an entanglement of travelling spiral waves forms in the course of time. We establish that this phenomenon is robust; it does not depend on the details of cyclic competition or spatial environment. These findings have important implications for maintenance and temporal development of ecological systems and are relevant for the formation and propagation of patterns in microbial populations or excitable media.","Reichenbach, Tobias; Mobilia, Mauro; Frey, Erwin","Reichenbach, T; Mobilia, M; Frey, E",1046,"Univ Munich, Arnold Sommerfeld Ctr Theoret Phys, D-80333 Munich, Germany; Univ Munich, Dept Phys, Ctr NanoSci, D-80333 Munich, Germany",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature06095,Article,,frey@lmu.de,1049,,,205EU,Y,N,SPATIAL COMPETITION; ALLELOPATHY; EVOLUTION; DYNAMICS; SYSTEMS; WAVES,7157,NATURE,Nature,English,31,No,"Reichenbach, Tobias/0000-0003-3367-3511; Mobilia, Mauro/0000-0002-1424-567X; Frey, Erwin/0000-0001-8792-3358","MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",30-Aug,4,LONDON,17728757.0,J,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2007,"Reichenbach, Tobias/G-7475-2011; Mobilia, Mauro/A-7045-2010","Frey, E (reprint author), Univ Munich, Arnold Sommerfeld Ctr Theoret Phys, Theresienstr 37, D-80333 Munich, Germany.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,0028-0836,NATURE,292,Mobility promotes and jeopardizes biodiversity in rock-paper-scissors games,8,83,WOS:000249097600037,441,448,Multidisciplinary Sciences,292,erwin,frey,11191,185,male,1,1,51841638,9516,Erwin Frey,1,1,Erwin Frey,0.98,4,"(9345, 17929]",yqC5qr0AAAAJ
120,"Since the 1950s, Heisenberg and others have addressed the problem of how to explain the appearance of countable particles in continuous fields(1). Stable localized field configurations were searched for an ingredient for a general field theory of elementary particles, but the majority of nonlinear field models were unable to predict them. As an exception, Skyrme succeeded in describing nuclear particles as localized states, so-called 'skyrmions'(2). Skyrmions are a characteristic of nonlinear continuum models ranging from microscopic to cosmological scales(3-6). Skyrmionic states have been found under non-equilibrium conditions, or when stabilized by external fields or the proliferation of topological defects. Examples are Turing patterns in classical liquids(7), spin textures in quantum Hall magnets(8), or the blue phases in liquid crystals(9). However, it has generally been assumed that skyrmions cannot form spontaneous ground states, such as ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic order, in magnetic materials. Here, we show theoretically that this assumption is wrong and that skyrmion textures may form spontaneously in condensed-matter systems with chiral interactions without the assistance of external fields or the proliferation of defects. We show this within a phenomenological continuum model based on a few material-specific parameters that can be determined experimentally. Our model has a condition not considered before: we allow for softened amplitude variations of the magnetization, characteristic of, for instance, metallic magnets. Our model implies that spontaneous skyrmion lattice ground states may exist generally in a large number of materials, notably at surfaces and in thin films, as well as in bulk compounds, where a lack of space inversion symmetry leads to chiral interactions.","Roessler, U.

121,"Modern strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis from the Americas are closely related to those from Europe, supporting the assumption that human tuberculosis was introduced post-contact(1). This notion, however, is incompatible with archaeological evidence of pre-contact tuberculosis in the New World(2). Comparative genomics of modern isolates suggests that M. tuberculosis attained its worldwide distribution following human dispersals out of Africa during the Pleistocene epoch(3), although this has yet to be confirmed with ancient calibration points. Here we present three 1,000-year-old mycobacterial genomes from Peruvian human skeletons, revealing that a member of the M. tuberculosis complex caused human disease before contact. The ancient strains are distinct from known human-adapted forms and are most closely related to those adapted to seals and sea lions. Two independent dating approaches suggest a most recent common ancestor for the M. tuberculosis complex less than 6,000 years ago, which supports a Holocene dispersal of the disease. Our results implicate sea mammals as having played a role in transmitting the disease to humans across the ocean.","Bos, Kirsten I.; Harkins, Kelly M.; Herbig, Alexander; Coscolla, Mireia; Weber, Nico; Comas, Inaki; Forrest, Stephen A.; Bryant, Josephine M.; Harris, Simon R.; Schuenemann, Verena J.; Campbell, Tessa J.; Majander, Kerttu; Wilbur, Alicia K.; Guichon, Ricardo A.; Steadman, Dawnie L.

122,"It is well known that the microstructures of the transition-metal oxides(1-3), including the high-transition-temperature (high-T-c) copper oxide superconductors(4-7), are complex. This is particularly so when there are oxygen interstitials or vacancies 8, which influence the bulk properties. For example, the oxygen interstitials in the spacer layers separating the superconducting CuO2 planes undergo ordering phenomena in Sr2O1+yCuO2 (ref.9), YBa2Cu3O6+y (ref.10) and La2CuO4+y (refs 11-15) that induce enhancements in the transition temperatures with no changes in hole concentrations. It is also known that complex systems often have a scale-invariant structural organization 16, but hitherto none had been found in high-T-c materials. Here we report that the ordering of oxygen interstitials in the La2O2+y spacer layers of La2CuO4+y high-T-c superconductors is characterized by a fractal distribution up to a maximum limiting size of 400 mu m.

123,"The ranges of plants and animals are moving in response to recent changes in climate(1). As temperatures rise, ecosystems with 'nowhere to go', such as mountains, are considered to be more threatened(2,3). However, species survival may depend as much on keeping pace with moving climates as the climate's ultimate persistence(4,5). Here we present a new index of the velocity of temperature change (km yr(-1)), derived from spatial gradients (degrees C km(-1)) and multimodel ensemble forecasts of rates of temperature increase (degrees C yr(-1)) in the twenty-first century. This index represents the instantaneous local velocity along Earth's surface needed to maintain constant temperatures, and has a global mean of 0.42 km yr(-1) (A1B emission scenario). Owing to topographic effects, the velocity of temperature change is lowest in mountainous biomes such as tropical and subtropical coniferous forests (0.08 km yr(-1)), temperate coniferous forest, and montane grasslands. Velocities are highest in flooded grasslands (1.26 km yr(-1)), mangroves and deserts. High velocities suggest that the climates of only 8% of global protected areas have residence times exceeding 100 years. Small protected areas exacerbate the problem in Mediterranean-type and temperate coniferous forest biomes. Large protected areas may mitigate the problem in desert biomes. These results indicate management strategies for minimizing biodiversity loss from climate change. Montane landscapes may effectively shelter many species into the next century. Elsewhere, reduced emissions, a much expanded network of protected areas(6), or efforts to increase species movement may be necessary(7).","Loarie, Scott R.; Duffy, Philip B.; Hamilton, Healy; Asner, Gregory P.; Field, Christopher B.; Ackerly, David D.","Loarie, SR; Duffy, PB; Hamilton, H; Asner, GP; Field, CB; Ackerly, DD",1052,"[Loarie, Scott R.; Duffy, Philip B.; Asner, Gregory P.; Field, Christopher B.] Carnegie Inst Sci, Dept Global Ecol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Duffy, Philip B.] Climate Cent Inc, Palo Alto, CA 94301 USA; [Hamilton, Healy] Calif Acad Sci, Ctr Appl Biodivers Informat, San Francisco, CA 94118 USA; [Ackerly, David D.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Integrat Biol, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature08649,Article,,loarie@stanford.edu,U111,Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation; Stanford University Global Climate and Energy Project,This work was made possible through the support of the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation and the Stanford University Global Climate and Energy Project.,535UB,Y,N,MIGRATION CAPACITY; PROTECTED AREAS; CHANGE IMPACTS; DISPERSAL; MOUNTAIN; SYSTEMS; FOREST; SHIFTS; BIRDS; USA,7276,NATURE,Nature,English,31,No,"Ackerly, David/0000-0002-1847-7398; Asner, Gregory/0000-0001-7893-6421","MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",24-Dec,6,LONDON,20033047.0,J,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2009,"Ackerly, David/A-1247-2009; Asner, Gregory/G-9268-2013","Loarie, SR (reprint author), Carnegie Inst Sci, Dept Global Ecol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,0028-0836,NATURE,705,The velocity of climate change,55,777,WOS:000272996000046,489,462,Multidisciplinary Sciences,726,david d.,ackerly,27340,1,male,1,1,45669173,252173,Virtru,0,0,Virtru,1.0,5,"(17929, ]",_umQuNkAAAAJ

They contain known and previously unknown bacterial species at different proportions; individuals with a low bacterial richness (23% of the population) are characterized by more marked overall adiposity, insulin resistance and dyslipidaemia and a more pronounced inflammatory phenotype when compared with high bacterial richness individuals. The obese individuals among the lower bacterial richness group also gain more weight over time. Only a few bacterial species are sufficient to distinguish between individuals with high and low bacterial richness, and even between lean and obese participants. Our classifications based on variation in the gut microbiome identify subsets of individuals in the general white adult population who may be at increased risk of progressing to adiposity-associated co-morbidities.","Le Chatelier, Emmanuelle; Nielsen, Trine; Qin, Junjie; Prifti, Edi; Hildebrand, Falk; Falony, Gwen; Almeida, Mathieu; Arumugam, Manimozhiyan; Batto, Jean-Michel; Kennedy, Sean; Leonard, Pierre; Li, Junhua; Burgdorf, Kristoffer; Grarup, Niels; Jorgensen, Torben; Brandslund, Ivan; Nielsen, Henrik Bjorn; Juncker, Agnieszka S.; Bertalan, Marcelo; Levenez, Florence; Pons, Nicolas; Rasmussen, Simon; Sunagawa, Shinichi; Tap, Julien; Tims, Sebastian; Zoetendal, Erwin G.; Brunak, Soren; Clement, Karine; Dore, Joel; Kleerebezem, Michiel; Kristiansen, Karsten; Renault, Pierre; Sicheritz-Ponten, Thomas; de Vos, Willem M.; Zucker, Jean-Daniel; Raes, Jeroen; Hansen, Torben; Bork, Peer; Wang, Jun; Ehrlich, S.

125,"Type 1 pili are the archetypal representative of a widespread class of adhesive multisubunit fibres in Gram-negative bacteria. During pilus assembly, subunits dock as chaperone-bound complexes to an usher, which catalyses their polymerization and mediates pilus translocation across the outer membrane. Here we report the crystal structure of the full-length FimD usher bound to the FimC-FimH chaperone-adhesin complex and that of the unbound form of the FimD translocation domain. The FimD-FimC-FimH structure shows FimH inserted inside the FimD 24-stranded beta-barrel translocation channel. FimC-FimH is held in place through interactions with the two carboxy-terminal periplasmic domains of FimD, a binding mode confirmed in solution by electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy. To accommodate FimH, the usher plug domain is displaced from the barrel lumen to the periplasm, concomitant with a marked conformational change in the beta-barrel. The amino-terminal domain of FimD is observed in an ideal position to catalyse incorporation of a newly recruited chaperone-subunit complex. The FimD-FimC-FimH structure provides unique insights into the pilus subunit incorporation cycle, and captures the first view of a protein transporter in the act of secreting its cognate substrate.","Phan, Gilles; Remaut, Han; Wang, Tao; Allen, William J.; Pirker, Katharina F.; Lebedev, Andrey; Henderson, Nadine S.; Geibel, Sebastian; Volkan, Ender; Yan, Jun; Kunze, Micha B.

126,"Activated RAS GTPase signalling is a critical driver of oncogenic transformation and malignant disease. Cellular models of RAS-dependent cancers have been used to identify experimental small molecules, such as SCH51344, but their molecular mechanism of action remains generally unknown. Here, using a chemical proteomic approach, we identify the target of SCH51344 as the human mutT homologue MTH1 (also known as NUDT1), a nucleotide pool sanitizing enzyme. Loss-of-function of MTH1 impaired growth of KRAS tumour cells, whereas MTH1 overexpression mitigated sensitivity towards SCH51344. Searching for more drug-like inhibitors, we identified the kinase inhibitor crizotinib as a nanomolar suppressor of MTH1 activity. Surprisingly, the clinically used (R)-enantiomer of the drug was inactive, whereas the (S)-enantiomer selectively inhibited MTH1 catalytic activity. Enzymatic assays, chemical proteomic profiling, kinome-wide activity surveys and MTH1 co-crystal structures of both enantiomers provide a rationale for this remarkable stereospecificity. Disruption of nucleotide pool homeostasis via MTH1 inhibition by (S)-crizotinib induced an increase in DNA single-strand breaks, activated DNA repair in human colon carcinoma cells, and effectively suppressed tumour growth in animal models. Our results propose (S)-crizotinib as an attractive chemical entity for further pre-clinical evaluation, and small-molecule inhibitors of MTH1 in general as a promising novel class of anticancer agents.","Huber, Kilian V.

127,"It has been proposed that memories are encoded by modification of synaptic strengths through cellular mechanisms such as long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD)(1). However, the causal link between these synaptic processes and memory has been difficult to demonstrate(2). Here we show that fear conditioning(3-8), a type of associative memory, can be inactivated and reactivated by LTD and LTP, respectively. We began by conditioning an animal to associate a foot shock with optogenetic stimulation of auditory inputs targeting the amygdala, a brain region known to be essential for fear conditioning(3-8). Subsequent optogenetic delivery of LTD conditioning to the auditory input inactivates memory of the shock. Then subsequent optogenetic delivery of LTP conditioning to the auditory input reactivates memory of the shock. Thus, we have engineered inactivation and reactivation of a memory using LTD and LTP, supporting a causal link between these synaptic processes and memory.","Nabavi, Sadegh; Fox, Rocky; Proulx, Christophe D.; Lin, John Y.; Tsien, Roger Y.; Malinow, Roberto","Nabavi, S; Fox, R; Proulx, CD; Lin, JY; Tsien, RY; Malinow, R",348,"[Nabavi, Sadegh; Fox, Rocky; Proulx, Christophe D.; Malinow, Roberto] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Neurosci, Ctr Neural Circuits & Behav, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Nabavi, Sadegh; Fox, Rocky; Proulx, Christophe D.; Malinow, Roberto] Univ Calif San Diego, Neurobiol Sect, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Lin, John Y.; Tsien, Roger Y.] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Pharmacol, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Tsien, Roger Y.] Univ Calif San Diego, Howard Hughes Med Inst, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature13294,Article,1476-4687,rmalinow@ucsd.edu,+,"NIH [MH049159, NS27177]; Cure Alzheimer's Foundation","We thank J.

Here we combine genome- wide polymorphism data from PCR- based exon resequencing, comparative genomic data across mammalian species, and protein structure predictions to estimate the number of functionally consequential singlenucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) carried by each of 15 African American (AA) and 20 European American (EA) individuals. We find that AAs show significantly higher levels of nucleotide heterozygosity than do EAs for all categories of functional SNPs considered, including synonymous, non- synonymous, predicted 'benign', predicted 'possibly damaging' and predicted 'probably damaging' SNPs. This result is wholly consistent with previous work showing higher overall levels of nucleotide variation in African populations than in Europeans(4). EA individuals, in contrast, have significantly more genotypes homozygous for the derived allele at synonymous and non- synonymous SNPs and for the damaging allele at ` probably damaging' SNPs than AAs do. For SNPs segregating only in one population or the other, the proportion of non-synonymous SNPs is significantly higher in the EA sample (55.4%) than in the AA sample (47.0%; P < 2.33 X 10(-37)). We observe a similar proportional excess of SNPs that are inferred to be 'probably damaging' (15.9% in EA; 12.1% in AA; P < 3.33 X 10(-11)). Using extensive simulations, we show that this excess proportion of segregating damaging alleles in Europeans is probably a consequence of a bottleneck that Europeans experienced at about the time of the migration out of Africa.","Lohmueller, Kirk E.; Indap, Amit R.; Schmidt, Steffen; Boyko, Adam R.; Hernandez, Ryan D.; Hubisz, Melissa J.; Sninsky, John J.; White, Thomas J.; Sunyaev, Shamil R.; Nielsen, Rasmus; Clark, Andrew G.; Bustamante, Carlos D.","Lohmueller, KE; Indap, AR; Schmidt, S; Boyko, AR; Hernandez, RD; Hubisz, MJ; Sninsky, JJ; White, TJ; Sunyaev, SR; Nielsen, R; Clark, AG; Bustamante, CD",994,"[Lohmueller, Kirk E.; Indap, Amit R.; Boyko, Adam R.; Hernandez, Ryan D.; Bustamante, Carlos D.] Cornell Univ, Dept Biol Stat & Computat Biol, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Lohmueller, Kirk E.; Boyko, Adam R.; Clark, Andrew G.] Cornell Univ, Dept Mol Biol & Genet, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Schmidt, Steffen] Max Planck Inst Dev Biol, Dept Biochem, D-72076 Tubingen, Germany; [Hubisz, Melissa J.] Univ Chicago, Dept Human Genet, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Sninsky, John J.; White, Thomas J.] Celera Diagnost, Alameda, CA 94592 USA; [Sunyaev, Shamil R.] Brigham & Womens Hosp, Div Genet, Dept Med, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Sunyaev, Shamil R.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Nielsen, Rasmus] Univ Copenhagen, Ctr Comparat Genom, Dept Biol, DK-2100 Copenhagen O, Denmark",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature06611,Article,,cdb28@cornell.edu,U5,"NHGRI NIH HHS [R01 HG003229, R01 HG003229-03]; NHLBI NIH HHS [R01 HL072904]; NIGMS NIH HHS [P50 GM065509, P50 GM065509-070006]",,264TK,,,HUMAN GENOME; NATURAL-SELECTION; BRAIN SIZE; EVOLUTION; MUTATIONS; ALLELES; HDL,7181,NATURE,Nature,English,30,No,"Nielsen, Rasmus/0000-0003-0513-6591; Pepper, John/0000-0001-9888-0437","MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",21-Feb,5,LONDON,18288194.0,J,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2008,"Nielsen, Rasmus/D-4405-2009; Pepper, John/O-1662-2013","Bustamante, CD (reprint author), Cornell Univ, Dept Biol Stat & Computat Biol, Biotechnol Bldg, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,0028-0836,NATURE,212,Proportionally more deleterious genetic variation in European than in African populations,1,16,WOS:000253313100049,17,451,Multidisciplinary Sciences,216,carlos d.,bustamante,26718,2,male,1,1,1217994,4490078,Carlos Bustamante,1,1,Carlos Bustamante,1.0,5,"(17929, ]",fPWa8HmjxJkC
129,"Extinction risk in natural populations depends on stochastic factors that affect individuals, and is estimated by incorporating such factors into stochastic models(1-9). Stochasticity can be divided into four categories, which include the probabilistic nature of birth and death at the level of individuals ( demographic stochasticity(2)), variation in population- level birth and death rates among times or locations ( environmental stochasticity(1,3)), the sex of individuals(6,8) and variation in vital rates among individuals within a population ( demographic heterogeneity(7,9)). Mechanistic stochastic models that include all of these factors have not previously been developed to examine their combined effects on extinction risk. Here we derive a family of stochastic Ricker models using different combinations of all these stochastic factors, and show that extinction risk depends strongly on the combination of factors that contribute to stochasticity. Furthermore, we show that only with the full stochastic model can the relative importance of environmental and demographic variability, and therefore extinction risk, be correctly determined. Using the full model, we find that demographic sources of stochasticity are the prominent cause of variability in a laboratory population of Tribolium castaneum ( red flour beetle), whereas using only the standard simpler models would lead to the erroneous conclusion that environmental variability dominates. Our results demonstrate that current estimates of extinction risk for natural populations could be greatly underestimated because variability has been mistakenly attributed to the environment rather than the demographic factors described here that entail much higher extinction risk for the same variability level.","Melbourne, Brett A.; Hastings, Alan","Melbourne, BA; Hastings, A",100,"[Melbourne, Brett A.] Univ Colorado, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Hastings, Alan] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Environm Sci & Policy, Davis, CA 95616 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature06922,Article,,brett.melbourne@colorado.edu,103,,,321MC,,,DEMOGRAPHIC STOCHASTICITY; VARYING ENVIRONMENT; SMALL POPULATIONS; MATING SYSTEM; 2 SEXES; SURVIVAL; DYNAMICS; TIME,7200,NATURE,Nature,English,30,No,"MELBOURNE, BRETT/0000-0002-8843-4131","MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",3-Jul,4,LONDON,18596809.0,J,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2008,,"Melbourne, BA (reprint author), Univ Colorado, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Boulder, CO 80309 USA.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,0028-0836,NATURE,211,Extinction risk depends strongly on factors contributing to stochasticity,2,206,WOS:000257308300045,210,454,Multidisciplinary Sciences,215,alan,hastings,25387,2079,male,1,1,30944095,13830,Alan Hastings,1,1,Alan Hastings,1.0,5,"(17929, ]",QPeYICIAAAAJ
130,"The quantum internet(1) is predicted to be the next-generation information processing platform, promising secure communication(2,3) and an exponential speed-up in distributed computation(2,4). The distribution of single qubits over large distances via quantum teleportation(5) is a key ingredient for realizing such a global platform. By using quantum teleportation, unknown quantum states can be transferred over arbitrary distances to a party whose location is unknown. Since the first experimental demonstrations of quantum teleportation of independent external qubits(6), an internal qubit(7) and squeezed states(8), researchers have progressively extended the communication distance. Usually this occurs without active feed-forward of the classical Bell-state measurement result, which is an essential ingredient in future applications such as communication between quantum computers. The benchmark for a global quantum internet is quantum teleportation of independent qubits over a free-space link whose attenuation corresponds to the path between a satellite and a ground station. Here we report such an experiment, using active feed-forward in real time. The experiment uses two free-space optical links, quantum and classical, over 143 kilometres between the two Canary Islands of La Palma and Tenerife. To achieve this, we combine advanced techniques involving a frequency-uncorrelated polarization-entangled photon pair source, ultra-low-noise single-photon detectors and entanglement-assisted clock synchronization. The average teleported state fidelity is well beyond the classical limit(9) of two-thirds. Furthermore, we confirm the quality of the quantum teleportation procedure without feed-forward by complete quantum process tomography. Our experiment verifies the maturity and applicability of such technologies in real-world scenarios, in particular for future satellite-based quantum teleportation.","Ma, Xiao-Song; Herbst, Thomas; Scheidl, Thomas; Wang, Daqing; Kropatschek, Sebastian; Naylor, William; Wittmann, Bernhard; Mech, Alexandra; Kofler, Johannes; Anisimova, Elena; Makarov, Vadim; Jennewein, Thomas; Ursin, Rupert; Zeilinger, Anton","Ma, XS; Herbst, T; Scheidl, T; Wang, DQ; Kropatschek, S; Naylor, W; Wittmann, B; Mech, A; Kofler, J; Anisimova, E; Makarov, V; Jennewein, T; Ursin, R; Zeilinger, A",269,"[Ma, Xiao-Song; Herbst, Thomas; Scheidl, Thomas; Wang, Daqing; Kropatschek, Sebastian; Naylor, William; Wittmann, Bernhard; Mech, Alexandra; Kofler, Johannes; Jennewein, Thomas; Ursin, Rupert; Zeilinger, Anton] Austrian Acad Sci, Inst Quantum Opt & Quantum Informat IQOQI, A-1090 Vienna, Austria; [Ma, Xiao-Song; Herbst, Thomas; Wittmann, Bernhard; Mech, Alexandra; Zeilinger, Anton] Univ Vienna, Fac Phys, Vienna Ctr Quantum Sci & Technol, A-1090 Vienna, Austria; [Kofler, Johannes] Max Planck Inst Quantum Opt, D-85748 Garching, Germany; [Anisimova, Elena; Makarov, Vadim; Jennewein, Thomas] Univ Waterloo, Inst Quantum Comp, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada; [Anisimova, Elena; Makarov, Vadim; Jennewein, Thomas] Univ Waterloo, Dept Phys & Astron, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature11472,Article,1476-4687,Xiaosong.Ma@Univie.ac.at; Anton.Zeilinger@Univie.ac.at,273,EU project MALICIA; Research Council of Norway [180439/V30]; Industry Canada; European Space Agency [4000104180/11/NL/AF]; Austrian Science Foundation (FWF) [SFB F4008]; CoQuS; FFG for the QTS project within the ASAP 7 program [828316]; European Commission; Q-ESSENCE [248095]; John Templeton Foundation,"We thank the staff of IAC: F.

131,"Cancer chromosomal instability (CIN) results in an increased rate of change of chromosome number and structure and generates intratumour heterogeneity(1,2). CIN is observed in most solid tumours and is associated with both poor prognosis and drug resistance(3,4). Understanding a mechanistic basis for CIN is therefore paramount. Here we find evidence for impaired replication fork progression and increased DNA replication stress in CIN+ colorectal cancer (CRC) cells relative to CIN- CRC cells, with structural chromosome abnormalities precipitating chromosome missegregation in mitosis. We identify three new CIN-suppressor genes (PIGN (also known as MCD4), MEX3C (RKHD2) and ZNF516 (KIAA0222)) encoded on chromosome 18q that are subject to frequent copy number loss in CIN+ CRC. Chromosome 18q loss was temporally associated with aneuploidy onset at the adenoma-carcinoma transition. CIN-suppressor gene silencing leads to DNA replication stress, structural chromosome abnormalities and chromosome missegregation. Supplementing cells with nucleosides, to alleviate replication-associated damage(5), reduces the frequency of chromosome segregation errors after CIN-suppressor gene silencing, and attenuates segregation errors and DNA damage in CIN+ cells. These data implicate a central role for replication stress in the generation of structural and numerical CIN, which may inform new therapeutic approaches to limit intratumour heterogeneity.","Burrell, Rebecca A.; McClelland, Sarah E.; Endesfelder, David; Groth, Petra; Weller, Marie-Christine; Shaikh, Nadeem; Domingo, Enric; Kanu, Nnennaya; Dewhurst, Sally M.; Gronroos, Eva; Chew, Su Kit; Rowan, Andrew J.; Schenk, Arne; Sheffer, Michal; Howell, Michael; Kschischo, Maik; Behrens, Axel; Helleday, Thomas; Bartek, Jiri; Tomlinson, Ian R.; Swanton, Charles","Burrell, RA; McClelland, SE; Endesfelder, D; Groth, P; Weller, MC; Shaikh, N; Domingo, E; Kanu, N; Dewhurst, SM; Gronroos, E; Chew, SK; Rowan, AJ; Schenk, A; Sheffer, M; Howell, M; Kschischo, M; Behrens, A; Helleday, T; Bartek, J; Tomlinson, IR; Swanton, C",492,"[Burrell, Rebecca A.; McClelland, Sarah E.; Endesfelder, David; Shaikh, Nadeem; Kanu, Nnennaya; Dewhurst, Sally M.; Gronroos, Eva; Chew, Su Kit; Rowan, Andrew J.; Howell, Michael; Behrens, Axel; Swanton, Charles] Canc Res UK London Res Inst, London WC2A 3LY, England; [Endesfelder, David; Schenk, Arne; Kschischo, Maik] Univ Appl Sci Koblenz, Dept Math & Technol, D-53424 Remagen, Germany; [Groth, Petra; Weller, Marie-Christine; Helleday, Thomas] Karolinska lnstitutet, Sci Life Lab, Div Translat Med & Chem Biol, Dept Med Biochem & Biophys, S-17121 Stockholm, Sweden; [Domingo, Enric; Tomlinson, Ian R.] Wellcome Trust Ctr Human Genet, Mol & Populat Genet & NIHR Biomed Res Ctr, Oxford OX3 7BN, England; [Chew, Su Kit; Swanton, Charles] UCL Canc Inst, London WC1E 6BT, England; [Sheffer, Michal] Weizmann Inst Sci, Dept Phys Complex Syst, IL-76100 Rehovot, Israel; [Bartek, Jiri] Danish Canc Soc, Res Ctr, DK-2100 Copenhagen, Denmark; [Bartek, Jiri] Palacky Univ Olomouc, Inst Mol & Translat Med, CZ-77515 Olomouc, Czech Republic",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature11935,Article,,charles.swanton@cancer.org.uk,496,Cancer Research UK; Medical Research Council; EU; Prostate Cancer Foundation; Breast Cancer Research Foundation; Oxford Biomedical Research Centre; Danish Cancer Society; Lundbeck Foundation; European Commission; Swedish Cancer Society; Swedish Research Council; Torsten and Ragnar Soderberg Foundation,"We thank A.

132,"The process of continental break- up provides a large- scale experiment that can be used to test causal relations between plate tectonics and the dynamics of the Earth's deep mantle(1,2). Detailed diagnostic information on the timing and dynamics of such events, which are not resolved by plate kinematic reconstructions, can be obtained from the response of the interior of adjacent continental plates to stress changes generated by plate boundary processes. Here we demonstrate a causal relationship between North Atlantic continental rifting at similar to 62 Myr ago and an abrupt change of the intra- plate deformation style in the adjacent European continent. The rifting involved a left- lateral displacement between the North American- Greenland plate and Eurasia, which initiated the observed pause in the relative convergence of Europe and Africa(3). The associated stress change in the European continent was significant and explains the sudden termination of a similar to 20- Myr- long contractional intra- plate deformation within Europe(4), during the late Cretaceous period to the earliest Palaeocene epoch, which was replaced by low- amplitude intra- plate stress- relaxation features(5). The pre- rupture tectonic stress was large enough to have been responsible for precipitating continental break- up, so there is no need to invoke a thermal mantle plume as a driving mechanism. The model explains the simultaneous timing of several diverse geological events, and shows how the intra- continental stratigraphic record can reveal the timing and dynamics of stress changes, which cannot be resolved by reconstructions based only on plate kinematics.","Nielsen, Soren B.; Stephenson, Randell; Thomsen, Erik","Nielsen, SB; Stephenson, R; Thomsen, E",1071,"Aarhus Univ, Dept Earth Sci, DK-8000 Aarhus C, Denmark; Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Fac Earth & Life Sci, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature06379,Article,,sbn@geo.au.dk,1074,,,240HY,,,RIFTED MARGIN; SEA; GREENLAND; ALPINE; SPITSBERGEN; TECTONICS; FORELAND; MOTIONS; HOTSPOT; BASIN,7172,NATURE,Nature,English,30,No,"Stephenson, Randell/0000-0003-4868-8601","MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",13-Dec,4,LONDON,18075591.0,J,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2007,"Stephenson, Randell/A-3741-2012; Thomsen, Erik/A-4842-2012; Nielsen, Soren/A-5288-2012","Nielsen, SB (reprint author), Aarhus Univ, Dept Earth Sci, Hoegh Guldbergsgade 2, DK-8000 Aarhus C, Denmark.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,0028-0836,NATURE,48,Dynamics of Mid-Palaeocene North Atlantic rifting linked with European intra-plate deformations,0,17,WOS:000251579900084,175,450,Multidisciplinary Sciences,48,erik,thomsen,20481,1072,male,0,0,na,na,na,0,0,na,0.99,5,"(17929, ]",fvZyVhwAAAAJ
133,"If not properly processed and repaired, DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) can give rise to deleterious chromosome rearrangements, which could ultimately lead to the tumour phenotype(1,2). DSB ends are resected in a 5' to 3' fashion in cells, to yield single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) for the recruitment of factors critical for DNA damage checkpoint activation and repair by homologous recombination 2. The resection process involves redundant pathways consisting of nucleases, DNA helicases and associated proteins(3). Being guided by recent genetic studies(4-6), we have reconstituted the first eukaryotic ATP-dependent DNA end-resection machinery comprising the Saccharomyces cerevisiae Mre11-Rad50-Xrs2 (MRX) complex, the Sgs1-Top3-Rmi1 complex, Dna2 protein and the heterotrimeric ssDNA-binding protein RPA. Here we show that DNA strand separation during end resection is mediated by the Sgs1 helicase function, in a manner that is enhanced by Top3-Rmi1 and MRX. In congruence with genetic observations(6), although the Dna2 nuclease activity is critical for resection, the Mre11 nuclease activity is dispensable. By examining the top3 Y356F allele and its encoded protein, we provide evidence that the topoisomerase activity of Top3, although critical for the suppression of crossover recombination(2,7), is not needed for resection either in cells or in the reconstituted system. Our results also unveil a multifaceted role of RPA, in the sequestration of ssDNA generated by DNA unwinding, enhancement of 5' strand incision, and protection of the 3' strand. Our reconstituted system should serve as a useful model for delineating the mechanistic intricacy of the DNA break resection process in eukaryotes.","Niu, Hengyao; Chung, Woo-Hyun; Zhu, Zhu; Kwon, Youngho; Zhao, Weixing; Chi, Peter; Prakash, Rohit; Seong, Changhyun; Liu, Dongqing; Lu, Lucy; Ira, Grzegorz; Sung, Patrick","Niu, HY; Chung, WH; Zhu, Z; Kwon, Y; Zhao, WX; Chi, P; Prakash, R; Seong, CH; Liu, DQ; Lu, L; Ira, G; Sung, P",108,"[Chung, Woo-Hyun; Zhu, Zhu; Ira, Grzegorz] Baylor Coll Med, Dept Mol & Human Genet, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Niu, Hengyao; Kwon, Youngho; Zhao, Weixing; Chi, Peter; Prakash, Rohit; Seong, Changhyun; Liu, Dongqing; Lu, Lucy; Sung, Patrick] Yale Univ, Sch Med, Dept Mol Biophys & Biochem, New Haven, CT 06520 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature09318,Article,,gira@bcm.edu; patrick.sung@yale.edu,U143,US National Institutes of Health; Susan G.

134,"Prion infections cause lethal neurodegeneration. This process requires the cellular prion protein (PrPC; ref. 1), which contains a globular domain hinged to a long amino-proximal flexible tail(2). Here we describe rapid neurotoxicity in mice and cerebellar organotypic cultured slices exposed to ligands targeting the alpha 1 and alpha 3 helices of the PrPC globular domain. Ligands included seven distinct monoclonal antibodies(3), monovalent Fab(1) fragments and recombinant single-chain variable fragment miniantibodies. Similar to prion infections(4-6), the toxicity of globular domain ligands required neuronal PrPC, was exacerbated by PrPC overexpression, was associated with calpain activation and was antagonized by calpain inhibitors. Neurodegeneration was accompanied by a burst of reactive oxygen species, and was suppressed by antioxidants. Furthermore, genetic ablation of the superoxide-producing enzyme NOX2 (also known as CYBB) protected mice from globular domain ligand toxicity. We also found that neurotoxicity was prevented by deletions of the octapeptide repeats within the flexible tail. These deletions did not appreciably compromise globular domain antibody binding, suggesting that the flexible tail is required to transmit toxic signals that originate from the globular domain and trigger oxidative stress and calpain activation. Supporting this view, various octapeptide ligands were not only innocuous to both cerebellar organotypic cultured slices and mice, but also prevented the toxicity of globular domain ligands while not interfering with their binding. We conclude that PrPC consists of two functionally distinct modules, with the globular domain and the flexible tail exerting regulatory and executive functions, respectively. Octapeptide ligands also prolonged the life of mice expressing the toxic PrPC mutant(7), PrP(Lambda 94-134), indicating that the flexible tail mediates toxicity in two distinct PrPC-related conditions.

135,"In metazoans, the Ras-Raf-MEK (mitogen-activated protein-kinase kinase)-ERK (extracellular signal-regulated kinase) signalling pathway relays extracellular stimuli to elicit changes in cellular function and gene expression. Aberrant activation of this pathway through oncogenic mutations is responsible for a large proportion of human cancer. Kinase suppressor of Ras (KSR)(1-3) functions as an essential scaffolding protein to coordinate the assembly of Raf-MEK-ERK complexes(4,5). Here we integrate structural and biochemical studies to understand how KSR promotes stimulatory Raf phosphorylation of MEK (refs 6, 7). We show, from the crystal structure of the kinase domain of human KSR2 (KSR2(KD)) in complex with rabbit MEK1, that interactions between KSR2(KD) and MEK1 are mediated by their respective activation segments and C-lobe alpha G helices. Analogous to BRAF (refs 8, 9), KSR2 self-associates through a side-to-side interface involving Arg 718, a residue identified in a genetic screen as a suppressor of Ras signalling(1-3). ATP is bound to the KSR2(KD) catalytic site, and we demonstrate KSR2 kinase activity towards MEK1 by in vitro assays and chemical genetics. In the KSR2(KD)-MEK1 complex, the activation segments of both kinases are mutually constrained, and KSR2 adopts an inactive conformation. BRAF allosterically stimulates the kinase activity of KSR2, which is dependent on formation of a side-to-side KSR2-BRAF heterodimer. Furthermore, KSR2-BRAF heterodimerization results in an increase of BRAF-induced MEK phosphorylation via the KSR2-mediated relay of a signal from BRAF to release the activation segment of MEK for phosphorylation. We propose that KSR interacts with a regulatory Raf molecule in cis to induce a conformational switch of MEK, facilitating MEK's phosphorylation by a separate catalytic Raf molecule in trans.","Brennan, Damian F.; Dar, Arvin C.; Hertz, Nicholas T.; Chao, William C.

136,"The self-assembly of proteins into highly ordered nanoscale architectures is a hallmark of biological systems. The sophisticated functions of these molecular machines have inspired the development of methods to engineer self-assembling protein nanostructures; however, the design of multi-component protein nanomaterials with high accuracy remains an outstanding challenge. Here we report a computational method for designing protein nanomaterials in which multiple copies of two distinct subunits co-assemble into a specific architecture. We use the method to design five 24-subunit cage-like protein nanomaterials in two distinct symmetric architectures and experimentally demonstrate that their structures are in close agreement with the computational design models. The accuracy of the method and the number and variety of two-component materials that it makes accessible suggest a route to the construction of functional protein nanomaterials tailored to specific applications.","King, Neil P.; Bale, Jacob B.; Sheffler, William; McNamara, Dan E.; Gonen, Shane; Gonen, Tamir; Yeates, Todd O.; Baker, David","King, NP; Bale, JB; Sheffler, W; McNamara, DE; Gonen, S; Gonen, T; Yeates, TO; Baker, D",103,"[King, Neil P.; Bale, Jacob B.; Sheffler, William; Gonen, Shane; Baker, David] Univ Washington, Dept Biochem, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [King, Neil P.; Baker, David] Univ Washington, Inst Prot Design, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Bale, Jacob B.] Univ Washington, Grad Program Mol & Cellular Biol, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [McNamara, Dan E.; Yeates, Todd O.] UCLA Dept Chem & Biochem, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Gonen, Shane; Gonen, Tamir] Howard Hughes Med Inst, Ashburn, VA 20147 USA; [Yeates, Todd O.] UCLA DOE Inst Genom & Prote, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Yeates, Todd O.] UCLA Mol Biol Inst, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Baker, David] Univ Washington, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Seattle, WA 98195 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature13404,Article,1476-4687,dabaker@u.washington.edu,+,"Howard Hughes Medical Institute; JFRC; National Science Foundation [CHE-1332907]; International AIDS Vaccine Initiative, DTRA [N00024-10-D-6318/0024]; AFOSR [FA950-12-10112]; DOE [DE-SC0005155]; NIH [T32GM067555]; NSF [DGE-0718124]; BER programme of the DOE Office of Science","We thank D.

137,"Heritable variation is the raw material for evolutionary change, and understanding its genetic basis is one of the central problems in modern biology. We investigated the genetic basis of a classic phenotypic dimorphism in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. Males from many natural isolates deposit a copulatory plug after mating, whereas males from other natural isolates - including the standard wild- type strain ( N2 Bristol) that is used in most research laboratories - do not deposit plugs(1). The copulatory plug is a gelatinous mass that covers the hermaphrodite vulva, and its deposition decreases the mating success of subsequent males(2). We show that the plugging polymorphism results from the insertion of a retrotransposon into an exon of a novel mucin- like gene, plg-1, whose product is a major structural component of the copulatory plug. The gene is expressed in a subset of secretory cells of the male somatic gonad, and its loss has no evident effects beyond the loss of male mate- guarding. Although C. elegans descends from an obligate- outcrossing, male - female ancestor(3,4), it occurs primarily as self- fertilizing hermaphrodites(5-7). The reduced selection on male - male competition associated with the origin of hermaphroditism may have permitted the global spread of a loss-of-function mutation with restricted pleiotropy.","Palopoli, Michael F.; Rockman, Matthew V.; TinMaung, Aye; Ramsay, Camden; Curwen, Stephen; Aduna, Andrea; Laurita, Jason; Kruglyak, Leonid","Palopoli, MF; Rockman, MV; TinMaung, A; Ramsay, C; Curwen, S; Aduna, A; Laurita, J; Kruglyak, L",1019,"[Palopoli, Michael F.; TinMaung, Aye; Ramsay, Camden; Curwen, Stephen; Aduna, Andrea; Laurita, Jason] Bowdoin Coll, Dept Biol, Brunswick, ME 04011 USA; [Rockman, Matthew V.; Kruglyak, Leonid] Princeton Univ, Carl Icahn Lab, Lewis Sigler Inst Integrat Genom, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Rockman, Matthew V.; Kruglyak, Leonid] Princeton Univ, Carl Icahn Lab, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature07171,Article,,mpalopol@bowdoin.edu,U66,"NIH [P20 RR-016463, R01 HG004321, P50 GM071508]; INBRE Program of the National Center for Research Resources; NSF [0110994]; Howard Hughes Medical Institute under the Undergraduate Science Education Program; James S.

138,"Understanding the genetic structure of human populations is of fundamental interest to medical, forensic and anthropological sciences. Advances in high- throughput genotyping technology have markedly improved our understanding of global patterns of human genetic variation and suggest the potential to use large samples to uncover variation among closely spaced populations(1-5). Here we characterize genetic variation in a sample of 3,000 European individuals genotyped at over half a million variable DNA sites in the human genome. Despite low average levels of genetic differentiation among Europeans, we find a close correspondence between genetic and geographic distances; indeed, a geographical map of Europe arises naturally as an efficient two-dimensional summary of genetic variation in Europeans. The results emphasize that when mapping the genetic basis of a disease phenotype, spurious associations can arise if genetic structure is not properly accounted for. In addition, the results are relevant to the prospects of genetic ancestry testing(6); an individual's DNA can be used to infer their geographic origin with surprising accuracy often to within a few hundred kilometres.","Novembre, John; Johnson, Toby; Bryc, Katarzyna; Kutalik, Zoltan; Boyko, Adam R.; Auton, Adam; Indap, Amit; King, Karen S.; Bergmann, Sven; Nelson, Matthew R.; Stephens, Matthew; Bustamante, Carlos D.","Novembre, J; Johnson, T; Bryc, K; Kutalik, Z; Boyko, AR; Auton, A; Indap, A; King, KS; Bergmann, S; Nelson, MR; Stephens, M; Bustamante, CD",98,"[Novembre, John] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Interdept Program Bioinformat, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Novembre, John; Stephens, Matthew] Univ Chicago, Dept Human Genet, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Stephens, Matthew] Univ Chicago, Dept Stat, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Johnson, Toby; Kutalik, Zoltan; Bergmann, Sven] Univ Lausanne, CHUV, Dept Med Genet, CH-1005 Lausanne, Switzerland; [Johnson, Toby] Univ Lausanne, CHUV, Univ Inst Social & Preventat Med, CH-1005 Lausanne, Switzerland; [Johnson, Toby; Kutalik, Zoltan; Bergmann, Sven] Swiss Inst Bioinformat, Cent Adm, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland; [Bryc, Katarzyna; Boyko, Adam R.; Auton, Adam; Indap, Amit; Bustamante, Carlos D.] Cornell Univ, Dept Biol Stat & Computat Biol, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [King, Karen S.; Nelson, Matthew R.] GlaxoSmithKline Inc, Res Triangle Pk, NC 27709 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature07331,Article,,jnovembre@ucla.edu,U5,Giorgi-Cavaglieri Foundation; Swiss National Science Foundation; US National Science Foundation Postdoctoral Fellowship in Bioinformatics; US National Institutes of Health; GlaxoSmithKline,"We thank J.

140,"Mammalian cells possess mechanisms to detect and defend themselves from invading viruses. In the cytosol, the RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs), RIG-I (retinoic acid-inducible gene I; encoded by DDX58) and MDA5 (melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5; encoded by IFIH1) sense atypical RNAs associated with virus infection(1,2). Detection triggers a signalling cascade via the adaptor MAVS that culminates in the production of type I interferons (IFN-alpha and beta; hereafter IFN), which are key antiviral cytokines. RIG-I and MDA5 are activated by distinct viral RNA structures and much evidence indicates that RIG-I responds to RNAs bearing a triphosphate (ppp) moiety in conjunction with a blunt-ended, base-paired region at the 5'-end (reviewed in refs 1-3). Here we show that RIG-I also mediates antiviral responses to RNAs bearing 5'-diphosphates (5'pp). Genomes from mammalian reoviruses with 5'pp termini, 5'pp-RNA isolated from yeast L-A virus, and base-paired 5'pp-RNAs made by in vitro transcription or chemical synthesis, all bind to RIG-I and serve as RIG-I agonists. Furthermore, a RIG-I-dependent response to 5'pp-RNA is essential for controlling reovirus infection in cultured cells and in mice. Thus, the minimal determinant for RIG-I recognition is a base-paired RNA with 5'pp. Such RNAs are found in some viruses but not in uninfected cells, indicating that recognition of 5'pp-RNA, like that of 5'ppp-RNA, acts as a powerful means of self/non-self discrimination by the innate immune system.","Goubau, Delphine; Schlee, Martin; Deddouche, Safia; Pruijssers, Andrea J.; Zillinger, Thomas; Goldeck, Marion; Schuberth, Christine; Van der Veen, Annemarthe G.; Fujimura, Tsutomu; Rehwinkel, Jan; Iskarpatyoti, Jason A.; Barchet, Winfried; Ludwig, Janos; Dermody, Terence S.; Hartmann, Gunther; Reis e Sousa, Caetano","Goubau, D; Schlee, M; Deddouche, S; Pruijssers, AJ; Zillinger, T; Goldeck, M; Schuberth, C; Van der Veen, AG; Fujimura, T; Rehwinkel, J; Iskarpatyoti, JA; Barchet, W; Ludwig, J; Dermody, TS; Hartmann, G; Sousa, CRE",372,"[Goubau, Delphine; Deddouche, Safia; Van der Veen, Annemarthe G.; Rehwinkel, Jan; Reis e Sousa, Caetano] Canc Res UK, London Res Inst, Immunobiol Lab, London WC2A 3LY, England; [Schlee, Martin; Zillinger, Thomas; Goldeck, Marion; Schuberth, Christine; Barchet, Winfried; Ludwig, Janos; Hartmann, Gunther] Univ Klinikum Bonn, Inst Klin Chem, D-53127 Bonn, Germany; [Schlee, Martin; Zillinger, Thomas; Goldeck, Marion; Schuberth, Christine; Barchet, Winfried; Ludwig, Janos; Hartmann, Gunther] Univ Klinikum Bonn, Klin Pharmakol, D-53127 Bonn, Germany; [Pruijssers, Andrea J.; Iskarpatyoti, Jason A.; Dermody, Terence S.] Vanderbilt Univ, Dept Pediat, Sch Med, Nashville, TN 37232 USA; [Pruijssers, Andrea J.; Iskarpatyoti, Jason A.; Dermody, Terence S.] Vanderbilt Univ, Sch Med, Elizabeth B Lamb Ctr Pediat Res, Nashville, TN 37232 USA; [Fujimura, Tsutomu] Univ Salamanca, Inst Biol Func & Genom, Consejo Super Invest Cient, Salamanca 37007, Spain; [Dermody, Terence S.] Vanderbilt Univ, Sch Med, Dept Pathol Microbiol & Immunol, Nashville, TN 37232 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature13590,Article,1476-4687,delphine.goubau@cancer.org.uk; caetano@cancer.org.uk,+,"Cancer Research UK; European Research Council (ERC Advanced Researcher Grant) [AdG-2010-268670]; Public Health Service award [R37 AI038296]; Elizabeth B.

141,"Contemporary Jews comprise an aggregate of ethno-religious communities whose worldwide members identify with each other through various shared religious, historical and cultural traditions(1,2). Historical evidence suggests common origins in the Middle East, followed by migrations leading to the establishment of communities of Jews in Europe, Africa and Asia, in what is termed the Jewish Diaspora(3-5). This complex demographic history imposes special challenges in attempting to address the genetic structure of the Jewish people(6). Although many genetic studies have shed light on Jewish origins and on diseases prevalent among Jewish communities, including studies focusing on uniparentally and biparentally inherited markers(7-16), genome-wide patterns of variation across the vast geographic span of Jewish Diaspora communities and their respective neighbours have yet to be addressed. Here we use high-density bead arrays to genotype individuals from 14 Jewish Diaspora communities and compare these patterns of genome-wide diversity with those from 69 Old World non-Jewish populations, of which 25 have not previously been reported. These samples were carefully chosen to provide comprehensive comparisons between Jewish and non-Jewish populations in the Diaspora, as well as with non-Jewish populations from the Middle East and north Africa. Principal component and structure-like analyses identify previously unrecognized genetic substructure within the Middle East. Most Jewish samples form a remarkably tight subcluster that overlies Druze and Cypriot samples but not samples from other Levantine populations or paired Diaspora host populations. In contrast, Ethiopian Jews (Beta Israel) and Indian Jews (Bene Israel and Cochini) cluster with neighbouring autochthonous populations in Ethiopia and western India, respectively, despite a clear paternal link between the Bene Israel and the Levant. These results cast light on the variegated genetic architecture of the Middle East, and trace the origins of most Jewish Diaspora communities to the Levant.","Behar, Doron M.; Yunusbayev, Bayazit; Metspalu, Mait; Metspalu, Ene; Rosset, Saharon; Parik, Jueri; Rootsi, Siiri; Chaubey, Gyaneshwer; Kutuev, Ildus; Yudkovsky, Guennady; Khusnutdinova, Elza K.; Balanovsky, Oleg; Semino, Ornella; Pereira, Luisa; Comas, David; Gurwitz, David; Bonne-Tamir, Batsheva; Parfitt, Tudor; Hammer, Michael F.; Skorecki, Karl; Villems, Richard","Behar, DM; Yunusbayev, B; Metspalu, M; Metspalu, E; Rosset, S; Parik, J; Rootsi, S; Chaubey, G; Kutuev, I; Yudkovsky, G; Khusnutdinova, EK; Balanovsky, O; Semino, O; Pereira, L; Comas, D; Gurwitz, D; Bonne-Tamir, B; Parfitt, T; Hammer, MF; Skorecki, K; Villems, R",238,"[Behar, Doron M.; Yudkovsky, Guennady; Skorecki, Karl] Mol Med Lab, IL-31096 Haifa, Israel; [Behar, Doron M.; Yunusbayev, Bayazit; Metspalu, Mait; Metspalu, Ene; Parik, Jueri; Rootsi, Siiri; Chaubey, Gyaneshwer; Kutuev, Ildus; Villems, Richard] Univ Tartu, Estonian Bioctr, EE-51010 Tartu, Estonia; [Behar, Doron M.; Yunusbayev, Bayazit; Metspalu, Mait; Metspalu, Ene; Parik, Jueri; Rootsi, Siiri; Chaubey, Gyaneshwer; Kutuev, Ildus; Villems, Richard] Univ Tartu, Dept Evolutionary Biol, EE-51010 Tartu, Estonia; [Yunusbayev, Bayazit; Kutuev, Ildus; Khusnutdinova, Elza K.] Russian Acad Sci, Ufa Res Ctr, Inst Biochem & Genet, Ufa 450054, Russia; [Rosset, Saharon] Tel Aviv Univ, Sch Math Sci, Dept Stat & Operat Res, IL-69978 Tel Aviv, Israel; [Yudkovsky, Guennady; Skorecki, Karl] Technion Israel Inst Technol, Rappaport Fac Med & Res Inst, IL-31096 Haifa, Israel; [Balanovsky, Oleg] Russian Acad Med Sci, Med Genet Res Ctr, Moscow 115478, Russia; [Semino, Ornella] Univ Pavia, Dipartimento Genet & Microbiol, I-27100 Pavia, Italy; [Pereira, Luisa] IPATIMUP, P-4200465 Oporto, Portugal; [Pereira, Luisa] Univ Porto, Fac Med, P-4200319 Oporto, Portugal; [Comas, David] CEXS UPF PRBB, Inst Evolutionary Biol, CSIC, Barcelona 08003, Spain; [Comas, David] CIBER Epidemiol & Salud Publ, Barcelona 08003, Spain; [Gurwitz, David; Bonne-Tamir, Batsheva] Tel Aviv Univ, Sackler Fac Med, Dept Human Mol Genet & Biochem, IL-69978 Tel Aviv, Israel; [Parfitt, Tudor] Univ London Sch Oriental & African Studies, Fac Languages & Cultures, Dept Languages & Cultures Near & Middle E, London WC1H 0XG, England; [Hammer, Michael F.] Univ Arizona, ARL Div Biotechnol, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature09103,Article,,behardm@usernet.com; skorecki@tx.technion.ac.il; rvillems@ebc.ee,U112,"European Commission [205419]; European Union through a Centre of Excellence in Genomics; Swedish Collegium for Advanced Studies; Estonian Science Foundation [7858, 7445]; Arthur and Rosalinde Gilbert Foundation; American Technion Society; European Union for Marie Curie International Reintegration [CT-2007-208019]; Israeli Science Foundation [1227/09]; Associate Laboratory of the Portuguese Ministry of Science, Technology and Higher Education; Fundacao para a Ciencia ea Tecnologia; Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology","We thank the individuals who provided DNA samples for this study, including the National Laboratory for the Genetics of Israeli Populations; Mari Nelis, Georgi Hudjashov and Viljo Soo for conducting the autosomal genotyping; Lauri Anton for computational help.

142,"To understand the workings of a living cell, we need to know the architectures of its macromolecular assemblies. Here we show how proteomic data can be used to determine such structures. The process involves the collection of sufficient and diverse high-quality data, translation of these data into spatial restraints, and an optimization that uses the restraints to generate an ensemble of structures consistent with the data. Analysis of the ensemble produces a detailed architectural map of the assembly. We developed our approach on a challenging model system, the nuclear pore complex (NPC). The NPC acts as a dynamic barrier, controlling access to and from the nucleus, and in yeast is a 50 MDa assembly of 456 proteins. The resulting structure, presented in an accompanying paper, reveals the configuration of the proteins in the NPC, providing insights into its evolution and architectural principles. The present approach should be applicable to many other macromolecular assemblies.","Alber, Frank; Dokudovskaya, Svetlana; Veenhoff, Liesbeth M.; Zhang, Wenzhu; Kipper, Julia; Devos, Damien; Suprapto, Adisetyantari; Karni-Schmidt, Orit; Williams, Rosemary; Chait, Brian T.; Rout, Michael P.; Sali, Andrej","Alber, F; Dokudovskaya, S; Veenhoff, LM; Zhang, WZ; Kipper, J; Devos, D; Suprapto, A; Karni-Schmidt, O; Williams, R; Chait, BT; Rout, MP; Sali, A",683,"Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Bioengn & Therapeut Sci, San Francisco, CA 94158 USA; Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Pharmaceut Chem, San Francisco, CA 94158 USA; Univ Calif San Francisco, Calif Inst Quantitat Biosci, San Francisco, CA 94158 USA; Rockefeller Univ, Lab Cellular & Struct Biol, New York, NY 10065 USA; Rockefeller Univ, Lab Mass Spectrometry & Gaseous Ion Chem, New York, NY 10065 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature06404,Article,,chait@rockefeller.edu; rout@rockefeller.edu; sali@salilab.org,694,"NCRR NIH HHS [U54 RR022220]; NIGMS NIH HHS [R01 GM062427, R01 GM083960]",,235BY,,,NUCLEAR-PORE COMPLEX; NUCLEOCYTOPLASMIC TRANSPORT; CRYOELECTRON TOMOGRAPHY; PROTEIN INTERACTIONS; NUCLEOPORINS; IDENTIFICATION; SACCHAROMYCES; PREDICTION; SUBUNIT; ALPHA,7170,NATURE,Nature,English,44,No,"Rout, Michael/0000-0003-2010-706X; devos, damien/0000-0002-9453-4753","MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",29-Nov,12,LONDON,18046405.0,J,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2007,,"Sali, A (reprint author), Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Bioengn & Therapeut Sci, Byers Hall,Suite 503B,1700 4th St, San Francisco, CA 94158 USA.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,0028-0836,NATURE,323,Determining the architectures of macromolecular assemblies,2,47,WOS:000251209700047,218,450,Multidisciplinary Sciences,328,andrej,sali,58432,84,male,1,1,8046892,9962100,Andrej Šali,0,0,Andrej Šali,0.99,5,"(17929, ]",mNWliccAAAAJ
143,"Bites and stings from venomous creatures can produce pain and inflammation as part of their defensive strategy to ward off predators or competitors(1,2). Molecules accounting for lethal effects of venoms have been extensively characterized, but less is known about the mechanisms by which they produce pain. Venoms from spiders, snakes, cone snails or scorpions contain a pharmacopoeia of peptide toxins that block receptor or channel activation as a means of producing shock, paralysis or death(3-5). We examined whether these venoms also contain toxins that activate ( rather than inhibit) excitatory channels on somatosensory neurons to produce a noxious sensation in mammals. Here we show that venom from a tarantula that is native to the West Indies contains three inhibitor cysteine knot (ICK) peptides that target the capsaicin receptor (TRPV1), an excitatory channel expressed by sensory neurons of the pain pathway(6). In contrast with the predominant role of ICK toxins as channel inhibitors(5,7), these previously unknown 'vanillotoxins' function as TRPV1 agonists, providing new tools for understanding mechanisms of TRP channel gating. Some vanillotoxins also inhibit voltage-gated potassium channels, supporting potential similarities between TRP and voltage-gated channel structures. TRP channels can now be included among the targets of peptide toxins, showing that animals, like plants ( for example, chilli peppers), avert predators by activating TRP channels on sensory nerve fibres to elicit pain and inflammation.","Siemens, Jan; Zhou, Sharleen; Piskorowski, Rebecca; Nikai, Tetsuro; Lumpkin, Ellen A.; Basbaum, Allan I.; King, David; Julius, David","Siemens, J; Zhou, S; Piskorowski, R; Nikai, T; Lumpkin, EA; Basbaum, AI; King, D; Julius, D",208,"Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Cellular & Mol Pharmacol, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; Univ Calif Berkeley, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Mass Spectrometry Lab, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Physiol, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Anat, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Physiol, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; Univ Calif San Francisco, WM Keck Ctr Integrat Neurosci, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature05285,Article,,julius@cmp.ucsf.edu,212,"NIAMS NIH HHS [R01 AR051219, R01 AR051219-03]",,103DZ,,,DEPENDENT K+ CHANNELS; ION-CHANNEL; TRP CHANNELS; POTASSIUM CHANNELS; TARANTULA TOXINS; GATING MODIFIER; PEPTIDES; SENSITIVITY; INHIBITION; PEPPERS,7116,NATURE,Nature,English,30,No,"Piskorowski, Rebecca/0000-0003-0120-2360","MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",9-Nov,5,LONDON,17093448.0,J,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2006,"Piskorowski, Rebecca/G-6610-2017","Julius, D (reprint author), Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Cellular & Mol Pharmacol, 600 16th St, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,0028-0836,NATURE,176,Spider toxins activate the capsaicin receptor to produce inflammatory pain,4,47,WOS:000241867200041,63,444,Multidisciplinary Sciences,185,david,julius,51937,12593,male,1,1,31954213,149798,David Julius,1,1,David Julius,1.0,5,"(17929, ]",80jf-tkAAAAJ
144,"The mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) kinase nucleates a pathway that promotes cell growth and proliferation and is the target of rapamycin, a drug with many clinical uses(1). mTORC1 regulates messenger RNA translation, but the overall translational program is poorly defined and no unifying model exists to explain how mTORC1 differentially controls the translation of specific mRNAs. Here we use high-resolution transcriptome-scale ribosome profiling to monitor translation in mouse cells acutely treated with the mTOR inhibitor Torin 1, which, unlike rapamycin, fully inhibits mTORC1 (ref. 2). Our data reveal a surprisingly simple model of the mRNA features and mechanisms that confer mTORC1-dependent translation control. The subset of mRNAs that are specifically regulated by mTORC1 consists almost entirely of transcripts with established 5' terminal oligopyrimidine (TOP) motifs, or, like Hsp90ab1 and Ybx1, with previously unrecognized TOP or related TOP-like motifs that we identified. We find no evidence to support proposals that mTORC1 preferentially regulates mRNAs with increased 5' untranslated region length or complexity(3). mTORC1 phosphorylates a myriad of translational regulators, but how it controls TOP mRNA translation is unknown(4). Remarkably, loss of just the 4E-BP family of translational repressors, arguably the best characterized mTORC1 substrates, is sufficient to render TOP and TOP-like mRNA translation resistant to Torin 1. The 4E-BPs inhibit translation initiation by interfering with the interaction between the cap-binding protein eIF4E and eIF4G1. Loss of this interaction diminishes the capacity of eIF4E to bind TOP and TOP-like mRNAs much more than other mRNAs, explaining why mTOR inhibition selectively suppresses their translation. Our results clarify the translational program controlled by mTORC1 and identify 4E-BPs and eIF4G1 as its master effectors.","Thoreen, Carson C.; Chantranupong, Lynne; Keys, Heather R.; Wang, Tim; Gray, Nathanael S.; Sabatini, David M.","Thoreen, CC; Chantranupong, L; Keys, HR; Wang, T; Gray, NS; Sabatini, DM",109,"[Thoreen, Carson C.; Gray, Nathanael S.] Dana Farber Canc Inst, Dept Canc Biol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Thoreen, Carson C.; Gray, Nathanael S.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Biol Chem & Mol Pharmacol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Thoreen, Carson C.; Chantranupong, Lynne; Keys, Heather R.; Wang, Tim; Sabatini, David M.] Whitehead Inst Biomed Res, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; [Chantranupong, Lynne; Keys, Heather R.; Wang, Tim; Sabatini, David M.] MIT, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Chantranupong, Lynne; Keys, Heather R.; Wang, Tim; Sabatini, David M.] MIT, Dept Biol, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Chantranupong, Lynne; Keys, Heather R.; Sabatini, David M.] Broad Inst Harvard & MIT, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature11083,Article,,nathanael_gray@dfci.harvard.edu; sabatini@wi.mit.edu,U142,"National Institutes of Health [CA103866, CA129105]; Department of Defense [W81XWH-07-0448]; W.M.

146,"Snakes possess a unique sensory system for detecting infrared radiation, enabling them to generate a 'thermal image' of predators or prey. Infrared signals are initially received by the pit organ, a highly specialized facial structure that is innervated by nerve fibres of the somatosensory system. How this organ detects and transduces infrared signals into nerve impulses is not known. Here we use an unbiased transcriptional profiling approach to identify TRPA1 channels as infrared receptors on sensory nerve fibres that innervate the pit organ. TRPA1 orthologues from pit-bearing snakes (vipers, pythons and boas) are the most heat-sensitive vertebrate ion channels thus far identified, consistent with their role as primary transducers of infrared stimuli. Thus, snakes detect infrared signals through a mechanism involving radiant heating of the pit organ, rather than photochemical transduction. These findings illustrate the broad evolutionary tuning of transient receptor potential (TRP) channels as thermosensors in the vertebrate nervous system.","Gracheva, Elena O.; Ingolia, Nicholas T.; Kelly, Yvonne M.; Cordero-Morales, Julio F.; Hollopeter, Gunther; Chesler, Alexander T.; Sanchez, Elda E.; Perez, John C.; Weissman, Jonathan S.; Julius, David","Gracheva, EO; Ingolia, NT; Kelly, YM; Cordero-Morales, JF; Hollopeter, G; Chesler, AT; Sanchez, EE; Perez, JC; Weissman, JS; Julius, D",1006,"[Gracheva, Elena O.; Kelly, Yvonne M.; Cordero-Morales, Julio F.; Hollopeter, Gunther; Chesler, Alexander T.; Julius, David] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Physiol, San Francisco, CA 94158 USA; [Ingolia, Nicholas T.; Weissman, Jonathan S.; Julius, David] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Cellular & Mol Pharmacol, San Francisco, CA 94158 USA; [Ingolia, Nicholas T.; Weissman, Jonathan S.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Howard Hughes Med Inst, San Francisco, CA 94158 USA; [Ingolia, Nicholas T.; Weissman, Jonathan S.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Calif Inst Quantitat Biosci, San Francisco, CA 94158 USA; [Sanchez, Elda E.; Perez, John C.] Texas A&M Univ, Nat Toxins Res Ctr, Kingsville, TX 78363 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature08943,Article,,julius@cmp.ucsf.edu,U66,"Ruth L.

There is mounting evidence that these peptides are less susceptible to bacterial resistance than traditional antibiotics and could form the basis for a new class of therapeutic agents(2). Here we report the rational design of new AmPs that show limited homology to naturally occurring proteins but have strong bacteriostatic activity against several species of bacteria, including Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus anthracis. These peptides were designed using a linguistic model of natural AmPs: we treated the amino-acid sequences of natural AmPs as a formal language and built a set of regular grammars to describe this language. We used this set of grammars to create new, unnatural AmP sequences. Our peptides conform to the formal syntax of natural antimicrobial peptides but populate a previously unexplored region of protein sequence space.","Loose, Christopher; Jensen, Kyle; Rigoutsos, Isidore; Stephanopoulos, Gregory","Loose, C; Jensen, K; Rigoutsos, I; Stephanopoulos, G",867,"MIT, Dept Chem Engn, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; Harvard MIT Div Hlth Sci & Technol, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; Agrivida, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; IBM Corp, Div Res, Thomas J Watson Res Ctr, Yorktown Hts, NY 10598 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature05233,Article,,gregstep@mit.edu,869,,,096FJ,,,SEQUENCES; MEMBRANE; DATABASE,7113,NATURE,Nature,English,19,No,"Rigoutsos, Isidore/0000-0003-1529-8631","MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",19-Oct,3,LONDON,17051220.0,J,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2006,,"Stephanopoulos, G (reprint author), MIT, Dept Chem Engn, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,0028-0836,NATURE,99,A linguistic model for the rational design of antimicrobial peptides,4,36,WOS:000241362700054,114,443,Multidisciplinary Sciences,106,gregory,stephanopoulos,34176,721,male,1,1,429665,18302078,George Stephanopoulos,1,1,George Stephanopoulos,1.0,5,"(17929, ]",S-DzIpYAAAAJ
148,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) show differential expression across breast cancer subtypes, and have both oncogenic and tumour-suppressive roles(1-6). Here we report the miRNA expression profiles of 1,302 breast tumours with matching detailed clinical annotation, long-term follow-up and genomic and messenger RNA expression data(7). This provides a comprehensive overview of the quantity, distribution and variation of the miRNA population and provides information on the extent to which genomic, transcriptional and post-transcriptional events contribute to miRNA expression architecture, suggesting an important role for post-transcriptional regulation. The key clinical parameters and cellular pathways related to the miRNA landscape are characterized, revealing context-dependent interactions, for example with regards to cell adhesion and Wnt signalling. Notably, only prognostic miRNA signatures derived from breast tumours devoid of somatic copy-number aberrations (CNA-devoid) are consistently prognostic across several other subtypes and can be validated in external cohorts. We then use a data-driven approach(8) to seek the effects of miRNAs associated with differential co-expression of mRNAs, and find that miRNAs act as modulators of mRNA-mRNA interactions rather than as on-off molecular switches. We demonstrate such an important modulatory role for miRNAs in the biology of CNA-devoid breast cancers, a common subtype in which the immune response is prominent. These findings represent a new framework for studying the biology of miRNAs in human breast cancer.","Dvinge, Heidi; Git, Anna; Graef, Stefan; Salmon-Divon, Mali; Curtis, Christina; Sottoriva, Andrea; Zhao, Yongjun; Hirst, Martin; Armisen, Javier; Miska, Eric A.; Chin, Suet-Feung; Provenzano, Elena; Turashvili, Gulisa; Green, Andrew; Ellis, Ian; Aparicio, Sam; Caldas, Carlos","Dvinge, H; Git, A; Graf, S; Salmon-Divon, M; Curtis, C; Sottoriva, A; Zhao, YJ; Hirst, M; Armisen, J; Miska, EA; Chin, SF; Provenzano, E; Turashvili, G; Green, A; Ellis, I; Aparicio, S; Caldas, C",378,"[Dvinge, Heidi; Git, Anna; Graef, Stefan; Chin, Suet-Feung; Caldas, Carlos] Canc Res UK Cambridge Inst, Cambridge CB2 0RE, England; [Dvinge, Heidi; Git, Anna; Graef, Stefan; Chin, Suet-Feung; Caldas, Carlos] Univ Cambridge, Li Ka Shing Ctr, Dept Oncol, Cambridge CB2 0RE, England; [Salmon-Divon, Mali] European Bioinformat Inst, European Mol Biol Lab, Cambridge CB10 1SD, England; [Salmon-Divon, Mali] Ariel Univ, Ctr Samaria, Dept Mol Biol, IL-40700 Ariel, Israel; [Curtis, Christina; Sottoriva, Andrea] Univ So Calif, Dept Prevent Med, Los Angeles, CA 90033 USA; [Zhao, Yongjun; Hirst, Martin] BC Canc Agcy, Genome Sci Ctr, Vancouver, BC V5Z 1L3, Canada; [Zhao, Yongjun; Hirst, Martin; Turashvili, Gulisa; Aparicio, Sam] Univ British Columbia, Dept Pathol & Lab Med, Vancouver, BC V6T 2B5, Canada; [Armisen, Javier; Miska, Eric A.] Univ Cambridge, Wellcome Trust Canc Res UK Gurdon Inst, Cambridge CB2 1QN, England; [Armisen, Javier; Miska, Eric A.] Univ Cambridge, Dept Biochem, Cambridge CB2 1QN, England; [Provenzano, Elena; Caldas, Carlos] Cambridge Univ Hosp NHS Fdn Trust, Addenbrookes Hosp, Cambridge Breast Unit, Cambridge CB2 2QQ, England; [Provenzano, Elena; Caldas, Carlos] NIHR Cambridge Biomed Res Ctr, Cambridge CB2 2QQ, England; [Turashvili, Gulisa; Aparicio, Sam] British Columbia Canc Res Ctr, Vancouver, BC V5Z 1L3, Canada; [Green, Andrew; Ellis, Ian] Univ Nottingham, Sch Mol Med Sci, Dept Histopathol, Nottingham NG5 1PB, England; [Caldas, Carlos] Cambridge Expt Canc Med Ctr, Cambridge CB2 0RE, England",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature12108,Article,,anna.git@cruk.cam.ac.uk; saparicio@bccrc.ca; carlos.caldas@cruk.cam.ac.uk,382,Cancer Research UK; British Columbia Cancer Foundation; University of Cambridge; Hutchinson Whampoa; NIHR Cambridge Biomedical Research Centre; Cambridge Experimental Cancer Medicine Centre,"The study was funded by Cancer Research UK and the British Columbia Cancer Foundation.

149,"Recent advances in measuring gene expression at the single- cell level have highlighted the stochastic nature of messenger RNA and protein synthesis(1-3). Stochastic gene expression creates a source of variability in the abundance of cellular components, even among isogenic cells exposed to an identical environment. Recent integrated experimental and modelling studies(4-13) have shed light on the molecular sources of this variability. However, many of these studies focus on systems that have reached a steady state and therefore do not address a large class of dynamic phenomena including oscillatory gene expression. Here we develop a general protocol for analysing and predicting stochastic gene expression in systems that never reach steady states. We use this framework to analyse experimentally stochastic expression of genes driven by the Synechococcus elongatus circadian clock. We find that, although the average expression at two points in the circadian cycle separated by 12 hours is identical, the variability at these two time points can be different. We show that this is a general feature of out- of- steady- state systems. We demonstrate how intrinsic noise sources, owing to random births and deaths of mRNAs and proteins, or extrinsic noise sources, which introduce fluctuations in rate constants, affect the cell- to- cell variability. To distinguish experimentally between these sources, we measured how the correlation between expression fluctuations of two identical genes is modulated during the circadian cycle. This quantitative framework is generally applicable to any out- of steady state system and will be necessary for understanding the fidelity of dynamic cellular systems.","Chabot, Jeffrey R.; Pedraza, Juan M.; Luitel, Prashant; van Oudenaarden, Alexander","Chabot, JR; Pedraza, JM; Luitel, P; van Oudenaarden, A",1249,"MIT, Dept Phys, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; MIT, George R Harrison Spect Lab, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature06395,Article,,avano@mit.edu,1252,,,243HA,,,SINGLE-CELL; PROTEIN EXPRESSION; NOISE; RHYTHMS; VARIABILITY; NETWORKS; LUCIFERASE; REPORTER; ORIGINS; LEVEL,7173,NATURE,Nature,English,30,No,,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",20-Dec,4,LONDON,18097413.0,J,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2007,,"van Oudenaarden, A (reprint author), MIT, Dept Phys, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,0028-0836,NATURE,71,Stochastic gene expression out-of-steady-state in the cyanobacterial circadian clock,1,9,WOS:000251786200054,160,450,Multidisciplinary Sciences,72,alexander,van oudenaarden,26343,1645,male,1,1,17509366,17509366,Alexander van Oudenaarden,1,1,Alexander van Oudenaarden,1.0,5,"(17929, ]",pxkP0GQAAAAJ
150,"Unlike random heteropolymers, natural proteins fold into unique ordered structures. Understanding how these are encoded in amino-acid sequences is complicated by energetically unfavourable non-ideal features-for example kinked alpha-helices, bulged beta-strands, strained loops and buried polar groups-that arise in proteins from evolutionary selection for biological function or from neutral drift. Here we describe an approach to designing ideal protein structures stabilized by completely consistent local and non-local interactions. The approach is based on a set of rules relating secondary structure patterns to protein tertiary motifs, which make possible the design of funnel-shaped protein folding energy landscapes leading into the target folded state. Guided by these rules, we designed sequences predicted to fold into ideal protein structures consisting of alpha-helices, beta-strands and minimal loops. Designs for five different topologies were found to be monomeric and very stable and to adopt structures in solution nearly identical to the computational models. These results illuminate how the folding funnels of natural proteins arise and provide the foundation for engineering a new generation of functional proteins free from natural evolution.","Koga, Nobuyasu; Tatsumi-Koga, Rie; Liu, Gaohua; Xiao, Rong; Acton, Thomas B.; Montelione, Gaetano T.; Baker, David","Koga, N; Tatsumi-Koga, R; Liu, GH; Xiao, R; Acton, TB; Montelione, GT; Baker, D",222,"[Koga, Nobuyasu; Tatsumi-Koga, Rie; Baker, David] Univ Washington, Dept Biochem, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Koga, Nobuyasu; Tatsumi-Koga, Rie; Baker, David] Univ Washington, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Liu, Gaohua; Xiao, Rong; Acton, Thomas B.; Montelione, Gaetano T.] Rutgers State Univ, Ctr Adv Biotechnol & Med, Dept Mol Biol & Biochem, NE Struct Genom Consortium, Piscataway, NJ 08854 USA; [Liu, Gaohua; Xiao, Rong; Acton, Thomas B.; Montelione, Gaetano T.] Univ Med & Dent New Jersey, Robert Wood Johnson Med Sch, Dept Biochem & Mol Biol, Piscataway, NJ 08854 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature11600,Article,1476-4687,guy@cabm.rutgers.edu; dabaker@u.washington.edu,227,HHMI; DOE; DARPA; DTRA; National Institutes of General Medical Science Protein Structure Initiative (PSI: Biology) programme [U54 GM094597]; Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) Postdoctoral Fellowships for Research Abroad,"We thank N.

151,"Domestic animals are excellent models for genetic studies of phenotypic evolution(1-3). They have evolved genetic adaptations to a new environment, the farm, and have been subjected to strong human-driven selection leading to remarkable phenotypic changes in morphology, physiology and behaviour. Identifying the genetic changes underlying these developments provides new insight into general mechanisms by which genetic variation shapes phenotypic diversity. Here we describe the use of massively parallel sequencing to identify selective sweeps of favourable alleles and candidate mutations that have had a prominent role in the domestication of chickens (Gallus gallus domesticus) and their subsequent specialization into broiler (meat-producing) and layer (egg-producing) chickens. We have generated 44.5-fold coverage of the chicken genome using pools of genomic DNA representing eight different populations of domestic chickens as well as red jungle fowl (Gallus gallus), the major wild ancestor(4). We report more than 7,000,000 single nucleotide polymorphisms, almost 1,300 deletions and a number of putative selective sweeps. One of the most striking selective sweeps found in all domestic chickens occurred at the locus for thyroid stimulating hormone receptor (TSHR), which has a pivotal role in metabolic regulation and photoperiod control of reproduction in vertebrates. Several of the selective sweeps detected in broilers overlapped genes associated with growth, appetite and metabolic regulation. We found little evidence that selection for loss-of-function mutations had a prominent role in chicken domestication, but we detected two deletions in coding sequences that we suggest are functionally important. This study has direct application to animal breeding and enhances the importance of the domestic chicken as a model organism for biomedical research.","Rubin, Carl-Johan; Zody, Michael C.; Eriksson, Jonas; Meadows, Jennifer R.
