When this relationship evolved relative to the origin of feathers and other novel integumentary structures, such as hair and filamentous body covering in extinct archosaurs, has not been evaluated. Here we sample melanosomes from the integument of 181 extant amniote taxa and 13 lizard, turtle, dinosaur and pterosaur fossils from the Upper-Jurassic and Lower-Cretaceous of China. We find that in the lineage leading to birds, the observed increase in the diversity of melanosome morphologies appears abruptly, near the origin of pinnate feathers in maniraptoran dinosaurs. Similarly, mammals show an increased diversity of melanosome form compared to all ectothermic amniotes. In these two clades, mammals and maniraptoran dinosaurs including birds, melanosome form and colour are linked and colour reconstruction may be possible. By contrast, melanosomes in lizard, turtle and crocodilian skin, as well as the archosaurian filamentous body coverings (dinosaur 'protofeathers' and pterosaur 'pycnofibres'), show a limited diversity of form that is uncorrelated with colour in extant taxa. These patterns may be explained by convergent changes in the key melanocortin system of mammals and birds, which is known to affect pleiotropically both melanin-based colouration and energetic processes such as metabolic rate in vertebrates(4), and may therefore support a significant physiological shift in maniraptoran dinosaurs.","[Li, Quanguo] China Univ Geosci, State Key Lab Biogeol & Environm Geol, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China; [Clarke, Julia A.] Univ Texas Austin, Dept Geol Sci, Austin, TX 78712 USA; [Gao, Ke-Qin] Peking Univ, Sch Earth & Space Sci, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China; [Zhou, Chang-Fu] Shenyang Normal Univ, Inst Paleontol, Shenyang 110034, Peoples R China; [Meng, Qingjin] Beijing Museum Nat Hist, Beijing 100050, Peoples R China; [Li, Daliang] Museum China Univ Geosci Beijing, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China; [D'Alba, Liliana; Shawkey, Matthew D.] Univ Akron, Dept Biol, Akron, OH 44325 USA; [D'Alba, Liliana; Shawkey, Matthew D.] Univ Akron, Integrated Biosci Program, Akron, OH 44325 USA","Clarke, JA (reprint author), Univ Texas Austin, Dept Geol Sci, 1 Univ Stn C1100, Austin, TX 78712 USA.",Julia_Clarke@jsg.utexas.edu; shawkey@uakron.edu,,"Shawkey, Matthew/0000-0002-5131-8209; D'Alba, Liliana/0000-0002-2478-3455","National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [41272031]; Fundamental Research Funds for Central Universities; Beijing Municipal Bureau of Human Resources; NSF [EAR-1251895, 1251922]; Human Frontier Science Program (HFSP) [RGY-0083]; Air Force Office of Scientific Research (AFOSR) [FA9550-13-1-0222]; Jurassic Foundation","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) grant 41272031, Fundamental Research Funds for Central Universities, Beijing Municipal Bureau of Human Resources, NSF grants EAR-1251895 and 1251922, Human Frontier Science Program (HFSP) grant RGY-0083, Air Force Office of Scientific Research (AFOSR) grant FA9550-13-1-0222, and the Jurassic Foundation.

The antiquity of Neanderthal gene flow into modern humans means that genomic regions that derive from Neanderthals in any one human today are usually less than a hundred kilobases in size. However, Neanderthal haplotypes are also distinctive enough that several studies have been able to detect Neanderthal ancestry at specific loci(1,3-8). We systematically infer Neanderthal haplotypes in the genomes of 1,004 present-day humans(9). Regions that harbour a high frequency of Neanderthal alleles are enriched for genes affecting keratin filaments, suggesting that Neanderthal alleles may have helped modern humans to adapt to non-African environments. We identify multiple Neanderthal-derived alleles that confer risk for disease, suggesting that Neanderthal alleles continue to shape human biology. An unexpected finding is that regions with reduced Neanderthal ancestry are enriched in genes, implying selection to remove genetic material derived from Neanderthals. Genes that are more highly expressed in testes than in any other tissue are especially reduced in Neanderthal ancestry, and there is an approximately fivefold reduction of Neanderthal ancestry on the X chromosome, which is known from studies of diverse species to be especially dense in male hybrid sterility genes(10-12). These results suggest that part of the explanation for genomic regions of reduced Neanderthal ancestry is Neanderthal alleles that caused decreased fertility in males when moved to a modern human genetic background.","[Sankararaman, Sriram; Mallick, Swapan; Patterson, Nick; Reich, David] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Genet, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Sankararaman, Sriram; Mallick, Swapan; Patterson, Nick; Reich, David] Broad Inst Harvard & MIT, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; [Dannemann, Michael; Pruefer, Kay; Kelso, Janet; Paeaebo, Svante] Max Planck Inst Evolutionary Anthropol, D-04103 Leipzig, Germany; [Reich, David] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Boston, MA 02115 USA","Sankararaman, S (reprint author), Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Genet, Boston, MA 02115 USA.",sankararaman@genetics.med.harvard.edu; reich@genetics.med.harvard.edu,"Reich, Daniel/E-5701-2010","Reich, Daniel/0000-0002-2628-4334",Presidential Innovation Fund of the Max Planck Society; NSF HOMINID [1032255]; NIH [GM100233]; Initiative for the Science of the Human Past at Harvard University,"We thank A.

A subset of retinal neurons, called direction-selective ganglion cells (DSGCs), are specialized for detecting motion along specific axes of the visual field(1). Despite extensive study of the retinal circuitry that endows DSGCs with their unique tuning properties(2,3), their downstream circuitry in the brain and thus their contribution to visual processing has remained unclear. In mice, several different types of DSGCs connect to the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN)(4-6), the visual thalamic structure that harbours cortical relay neurons. Whether direction-selective information computed at the level of the retina is routed to cortical circuits and integrated with other visual channels, however, is unknown. Here we show that there is a di-synaptic circuit linking DSGCs with the superficial layers of the primary visual cortex (V1) by using viral trans-synaptic circuit mapping(7,8) and functional imaging of visually driven calcium signals in thalamocortical axons. This circuit pools information from several types of DSGCs, converges in a specialized subdivision of the dLGN, and delivers direction-tuned and orientation-tuned signals to superficial V1. Notably, this circuit is anatomically segregated from the retino-geniculo-cortical pathway carrying non-direction-tuned visual information to deeper layers of V1, such as layer 4. Thus, the mouse harbours several functionally specialized, parallel retino-geniculo-cortical pathways, one of which originates with retinal DSGCs and delivers direction-and orientation-tuned information specifically to the superficial layers of the primary visual cortex. These data provide evidence that direction and orientation selectivity of some V1 neurons may be influenced by the activation of DSGCs.","[Cruz-Martin, Alberto; El-Danaf, Rana N.; Dhande, Onkar S.; Nguyen, Phong L.; Huberman, Andrew D.] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Neurosci, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Cruz-Martin, Alberto; El-Danaf, Rana N.; Sriram, Balaji; Dhande, Onkar S.; Nguyen, Phong L.; Huberman, Andrew D.] Univ Calif San Diego, Div Biol Sci, Neurobiol Sect, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Osakada, Fumitaka; Callaway, Edward M.; Huberman, Andrew D.] Salk Inst Biol Studies, La Jolla, CA 92097 USA; [Ghosh, Anirvan] F Hoffmann La Roche & Cie AG, Neurosci Discovery, CH-4070 Basel, Switzerland; [Huberman, Andrew D.] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Ophthalmol, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA","Huberman, AD (reprint author), Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Neurosci, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.",ahuberman@ucsd.edu,"Callaway, Edward/D-4336-2011","Callaway, Edward/0000-0002-6366-5267","Vision Core [P30 EY019005]; Knights Templar Eye Foundation; Japan Society for the Promotion of Science; Kanae Foundation; Uehara Memorial Foundation; Naito Foundation; NINDS Circuits Training Grant; Gatsby Charitable Trusts; NIH [EY022577, MH063912, R01EY022157]; Whitehall Foundation; Ziegler Foundation for the Blind; Pew Charitable Trusts; McKnight Foundation","We thank the Kleinfeld laboratory for helpful advice, F.

In addition to the Lgr5 marker, intestinal stem cells have been associated with other markers that are expressed heterogeneously within the crypt base region(1-6). Previous quantitative clonal fate analyses have led to the proposal that homeostasis occurs as the consequence of neutral competition between dividing stem cells(7-9). However, the short-term behaviour of individual Lgr5(+) cells positioned at different locations within the crypt base compartment has not been resolved. Here we establish the short-term dynamics of intestinal stem cells using the novel approach of continuous intravital imaging of Lgr5-Confetti mice. Wefind that Lgr5(+) cells in the upper part of the niche (termed 'border cells') can be passively displaced into the transit-amplifying domain, after the division of proximate cells, implying that the determination of stem-cell fate can be uncoupled from division. Through quantitative analysis of individual clonal lineages, we show that stem cells at the crypt base, termed 'central cells', experience a survival advantage over border stem cells. However, through the transfer of stem cells between the border and central regions, all Lgr5(+) cells are endowed with long-term self-renewal potential. These findings establish a novel paradigm for stem-cell maintenance in which a dynamically heterogeneous cell population is able to function long term as a single stem-cell pool.","[Ritsma, Laila; Ellenbroek, Saskia I.

Their inhibitory function has been associated primarily with interleukin 10 (IL-10) because B-cell-derived IL-10 can protect against autoimmune disease and increase susceptibility to pathogens(1,2). Here we identify IL-35-producing B cells as key players in the negative regulation of immunity. Mice in which only B cells did not express IL-35 lost their ability to recover from the T-cell mediated demyelinating autoimmune disease experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). In contrast, these mice displayed a markedly improved resistance to infection with the intracellular bacterial pathogen Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium as shown by their superior containment of the bacterial growth and their prolonged survival after primary infection, and upon secondary challenge, compared to control mice. The increased immunity found in mice lacking IL-35 production by B cells was associated with a higher activation of macrophages and inflammatory T cells, as well as an increased function of B cells as antigen-presenting cells (APCs). During Salmonella infection, IL-35- and IL-10-producing B cells corresponded to two largely distinct sets of surface-IgM1 CD138(hi)TACI(+)CXCR4(+)CD1d(int)Tim1(int) plasma cells expressing the transcription factor Blimp1 (also known as Prdm1). During EAE, CD138(+) plasma cells were also the main source of B-cell-derived IL-35 and IL-10. Collectively, our data show the importance of IL-35 producing B cells in regulation of immunity and highlight IL-35 production by B cells as a potential therapeutic target for autoimmune and infectious diseases. This study reveals the central role of activated B cells, particularly plasma cells, and their production of cytokines in the regulation of immune responses in health and disease.","[Shen, Ping; Roch, Toralf; Lampropoulou, Vicky; Stervbo, Ulrik; Hilgenberg, Ellen; Ries, Stefanie; Van Duc Dang; Jaimes, Yarua; Daridon, Capucine; Wilantri, Siska; Sakwa, Imme; Hoehlig, Kai; Gruetzkau, Andreas; Gruen, Joachim R.; Horn, Katharina; Doerner, Thomas; Fillatreau, Simon] Deutsch Rheuma Forschungszentrum, Charite Pl 1, D-10117 Berlin, Germany; [O'Connor, Richard A.; Leech, Melanie D.; McPherson, Rhoanne C.; Anderton, Stephen M.] Univ Edinburgh, Ctr Inflammat Res, Edinburgh EH16 4TJ, Midlothian, Scotland; [O'Connor, Richard A.; Leech, Melanie D.; McPherson, Rhoanne C.; Anderton, Stephen M.] Univ Edinburgh, Ctr Multiple Sclerosis Res, Queens Med Res Inst, Edinburgh EH16 4TJ, Midlothian, Scotland; [Daridon, Capucine; Doerner, Thomas] Charite, Dept Med Rheumatol & Clin Immunol, CC12, D-10117 Berlin, Germany; [Li, Rui; Miyazaki, Yusei; Bar-Or, Amit] McGill Univ, Montreal Neurol Inst & Hosp, Neuroimmunol Unit, Montreal, PQ H3A 2B4, Canada; [Jouneau, Luc; Boudinot, Pierre] INRA, Virol & Immunol Mol, F-78352 Jouy En Josas, France; [Wirtz, Stefan; Neurath, Markus] Univ Erlangen Nurnberg, Med Clin 1, D-91054 Erlangen, Germany; [Meinl, Edgar] Univ Munich, Inst Klin Neuroimmunol Klinikum, D-81377 Munich, Germany; [Kuehl, Anja A.] Res Ctr ImmunoSci, D-12203 Berlin, Germany; [Kaufmann, Stefan H.

Although the molecular mechanisms linking these noncoding variants with obesity are not immediately obvious, subsequent studies in mice demonstrated that FTO expression levels influence body mass and composition phenotypes(4-6). However, no direct connection between the obesity-associated variants and FTO expression or function has been made(7-9). Here we show that the obesity-associated noncoding sequences within FTO are functionally connected, at megabase distances, with the homeobox gene IRX3. The obesity-associated FTO region directly interacts with the promoters of IRX3 as well as FTO in the human, mouse and zebrafish genomes. Furthermore, long-range enhancers within this region recapitulate aspects of IRX3 expression, suggesting that the obesity-associated interval belongs to the regulatory landscape of IRX3. Consistent with this, obesity-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms are associated with expression of IRX3, but not FTO, in human brains. A direct link between IRX3 expression and regulation of body mass and composition is demonstrated by a reduction in body weight of 25 to 30% in Irx3-deficient mice, primarily through the loss of fat mass and increase in basal metabolic rate with browning of white adipose tissue. Finally, hypothalamic expression of a dominant negative form of Irx3 reproduces the metabolic phenotypes of Irx3 deficient mice. Our data suggest that IRX3 is a functional long-range target of obesity-associated variants within FTO and represents a novel determinant of body mass and composition.","[Smemo, Scott; Sakabe, Noboru J.; Aneas, Ivy; Credidio, Flavia L.; Sobreira, Debora R.; Wasserman, Nora F.; Shen, Michael; Cox, Nancy J.; Nobrega, Marcelo A.] Univ Chicago, Dept Human Genet, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Tena, Juan J.; Gomez-Marin, Carlos; Naranjo, Silvia; Acemel, Rafael D.; Luis Gomez-Skarmeta, Jose] Univ Pablo Olavide, Ctr Andaluz Biol Desarrollo CABD, Consejo Super Invest Cient, Seville 41013, Spain; [Kim, Kyoung-Han; Lee, Ju Hee; Puviindran, Vijitha; Tam, Davis; Vakili, Niki Alizadeh; Hui, Chi-Chung] Univ Toronto, Hosp Sick Children, Program Dev & Stem Cell Biol, Toronto, ON M5S 1A8, Canada; [Kim, Kyoung-Han; Lee, Ju Hee; Puviindran, Vijitha; Tam, Davis; Vakili, Niki Alizadeh; Hui, Chi-Chung] Univ Toronto, Dept Mol Genet, Toronto, ON M5S 1A8, Canada; [Gamazon, Eric R.; Cox, Nancy J.] Univ Chicago, Med Genet Sect, Dept Med, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Son, Joe Eun; Sung, Hoon-Ki; Nagy, Andras] Mt Sinai Hosp, Lunenfeld Tanenbaum Res Inst, Toronto, ON M5T 3H7, Canada; [Manzanares, Miguel] Ctr Nacl Invest Cardiovasc CNIC, Cardiovasc Dev & Repair Dept, Madrid 28029, Spain","Nobrega, MA (reprint author), Univ Chicago, Dept Human Genet, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.",cchui@sickkids.ca; jlgomska@upo.es; nobrega@uchicago.edu,"; Nagy, Andras/G-6465-2013; Gomez-Skarmeta, Jose Luis/B-5268-2014; Tena, Juan/M-2265-2014; Manzanares, Miguel/E-1702-2015; Naranjo, Silvia/P-9845-2016","Gamazon, Eric/0000-0003-4204-8734; Nagy, Andras/0000-0003-4311-0413; Gomez-Skarmeta, Jose Luis/0000-0001-5125-4332; Tena, Juan/0000-0001-8165-7984; Manzanares, Miguel/0000-0003-4849-2836; Naranjo, Silvia/0000-0002-4529-3332; Gomez-Marin, Carlos/0000-0001-9724-2919; Dominguez Acemel, Rafael/0000-0003-4120-0140","National Institutes of Health [DK093972, HL119967, HL114010, DK020595, MH101820, MH090937, DK20595]; Spanish Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad [BFU2010-14839, CSD2007-00008]; Andalusian Government [CVI-3488]; Canadian Institute of Health Research; Heart and Stroke Foundation of Canada; NIH [T32HL007381]","The authors thank F.

Understanding the nature of the mechanisms linking angiogenesis and bone formation should be of great relevance for improved fracture healing or prevention of bone mass loss. Here we show that vascular growth in bone involves a specialized, tissue-specific form of angiogenesis. Notch signalling promotes endothelial cell proliferation and vessel growth in postnatal long bone, which is the opposite of the well-established function of Notch and its ligand Dll4 in the endothelium of other organs and tumours(3,4). Endothelial-cell-specific and inducible genetic disruption of Notch signalling in mice not only impaired bone vessel morphology and growth, but also led to reduced osteogenesis, shortening of long bones, chondrocyte defects, loss of trabeculae and decreased bone mass. On the basis of a series of genetic experiments, we conclude that skeletal defects in these mutants involved defective angiocrine release of Noggin from endothelial cells, which is positively regulated by Notch. Administration of recombinant Noggin, a secreted antagonist of bone morphogenetic proteins, restored bone growth and mineralization, chondrocyte maturation, the formation of trabeculae and osteoprogenitor numbers in endothelial-cell-specific Notch pathway mutants. These findings establish a molecular framework coupling angiogenesis, angiocrine signals and osteogenesis, which may prove significant for the development of future therapeutic applications.","[Ramasamy, Saravana K.; Kusumbe, Anjali P.; Wang, Lin; Adams, Ralf H.] Max Planck Inst Mol Biomed, Dept Tissue Morphogenesis, D-48149 Munster, Germany; [Adams, Ralf H.] Univ Munster, Fac Med, D-48149 Munster, Germany","Adams, RH (reprint author), Max Planck Inst Mol Biomed, Dept Tissue Morphogenesis, D-48149 Munster, Germany.",ralf.adams@mpi-muenster.mpg.de,,"Ramasamy, Saravana/0000-0003-2658-2945",Max Planck Society; University of Munster; DFG cluster of excellence 'Cells in Motion'; European Research Council [AdG 339409 AngioBone],"We thank A.

The nature and causative relationship of the DNA sequence and chromatin signals that govern the selection of most TSSs by RNA polymerase II remain unresolved. Maternal to zygotic transition represents the most marked change of the transcriptome repertoire in the vertebrate life cycle(3-6). Early embryonic development in zebrafish is characterized by a series of transcriptionally silent cell cycles regulated by inherited maternal gene products: zygotic genome activation commences at the tenth cell cycle, marking the mid-blastula transition(7). This transition provides a unique opportunity to study the rules of TSS selection and the hierarchy of events linking transcription initiation with key chromatin modifications. We analysed TSS usage during zebrafish early embryonic development at high resolution using cap analysis of gene expression(8), and determined the positions of H3K4me3-marked promoter-associated nucleosomes(9). Here we show that the transition from the maternal to zygotic transcriptome is characterized by a switch between two fundamentally different modes of defining transcription initiation, which drive the dynamic change of TSS usage and promoter shape. A maternal-specific TSS selection, which requires an A/T-rich (W-box) motif, is replaced with a zygotic TSS selection grammar characterized by broader patterns of dinucleotide enrichments, precisely aligned with the first downstream (11) nucleosome. The developmental dynamics of the H3K4me3-marked nucleosomes reveal their DNA-sequence-associated positioning at promoters before zygotic transcription and subsequent transcription independent adjustment to the final position downstream of the zygotic TSS. The two TSS-defining grammars coexist, often physically overlapping, in core promoters of constitutively expressed genes to enable their expression in the two regulatory environments. The dissection of overlapping core promoter determinants represents a framework for future studies of promoter structure and function across different regulatory contexts.","[Haberle, Vanja] Univ Bergen, Dept Biol, N-5008 Bergen, Norway; [Haberle, Vanja; Lenhard, Boris] Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Hammersmith Hosp, Inst Clin Sci, London W12 0NN, England; [Haberle, Vanja; Lenhard, Boris] Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Hammersmith Hosp, MRC Clin Sci Ctr, Fac Med, London W12 0NN, England; [Li, Nan; Hadzhiev, Yavor; Gehrig, Jochen; Mueller, Ferenc] Univ Birmingham, Coll Med & Dent Sci, Sch Clin & Expt Med, Birmingham, W Midlands, England; [Plessy, Charles; Suzuki, Ana Maria; Carninci, Piero] RIKEN Om Sci Ctr, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2300045, Japan; [Plessy, Charles; Suzuki, Ana Maria; Carninci, Piero] RIKEN Ctr Life Sci Technol, Div Genom Technol, Tsurumi Ku, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2300045, Japan; [Previti, Christopher; Nepal, Chirag; Dong, Xianjun; Akalin, Altuna] Univ Bergen, Uni Res AS, Computat Biol Unit, N-5008 Bergen, Norway; [van IJcken, Wilfred F.

Classical studies suggested that AT1 arise from AT2 cells, but recent studies propose other sources. Here we use molecular markers, lineage tracing and clonal analysis to map alveolar progenitors throughout the mouse lifespan. We show that, during development, AT1 and AT2 cells arise directly from a bipotent progenitor, whereas after birth new AT1 cells derive from rare, self-renewing, long-lived, mature AT2 cells that produce slowly expanding clonal foci of alveolar renewal. This stem-cell function is broadly activated by AT1 injury, and AT2 self-renewal is selectively induced by EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor) ligands in vitro and oncogenic Kras(G12D) in vivo, efficiently generating multifocal, clonal adenomas. Thus, there is a switch after birth, when AT2 cells function as stem cells that contribute to alveolar renewal, repair and cancer. We propose that local signals regulate AT2 stem-cell activity: a signal transduced by EGFR-KRAS controls self-renewal and is hijacked during oncogenesis, whereas another signal controls reprogramming to AT1 fate.","[Desai, Tushar J.; Brownfield, Douglas G.; Krasnow, Mark A.] Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Dept Biochem, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Desai, Tushar J.; Brownfield, Douglas G.; Krasnow, Mark A.] Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Desai, Tushar J.] Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Dept Internal Med, Div Pulm & Crit Care, Stanford, CA 94305 USA","Krasnow, MA (reprint author), Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Dept Biochem, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",tdesai@stanford.edu; krasnow@stanford.edu,,,"NCI NIH HHS [P30 CA124435]; NHLBI NIH HHS [K08 HL084095, U01 HL099995, U01 HL099999]; NICHD NIH HHS [T32 HD007249]",,,52,188,194,1,68,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,13-Mar,2014,507,7491,,,,,190,+,,10.1038/nature12930,,16,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,AC6RJ,WOS:000332651800030,24499815,No,Y,N,11/20/17

Here we identify a molecular mechanism by which structural polymorphism of the HRE leads to ALS/FTD pathology and defects. The HRE forms DNA and RNA G-quadruplexes with distinct structures and promotes RNA-DNA hybrids (R-loops). The structural polymorphism causes a repeat-length-dependent accumulation of transcripts aborted in the HRE region. These transcribed repeats bind to ribonucleoproteins in a conformation-dependent manner. Specifically, nucleolin, an essential nucleolar protein, preferentially binds the HRE G-quadruplex, and patient cells show evidence of nucleolar stress. Our results demonstrate that distinct C9orf72 HRE structural polymorphism at both DNA and RNA levels initiates molecular cascades leading to ALS/FTD pathologies, and provide the basis for a mechanistic model for repeat-associated neurodegenerative diseases.","[Haeusler, Aaron R.; Periz, Goran; Simko, Eric A.

Several major pathogens have resisted traditional vaccine development, although vulnerable epitopes targeted by neutralizing antibodies have been identified for several such cases. Hence, new vaccine design methods to induce epitope-specific neutralizing antibodies are needed. Here we show, with a neutralization epitope from respiratory syncytial virus, that computational protein design can generate small, thermally and conformationally stable protein scaffolds that accurately mimic the viral epitope structure and induce potent neutralizing antibodies. These scaffolds represent promising leads for the research and development of a human respiratory syncytial virus vaccine needed to protect infants, young children and the elderly. More generally, the results provide proof of principle for epitope-focused and scaffold-based vaccine design, and encourage the evaluation and further development of these strategies for a variety of other vaccine targets, including antigenically highly variable pathogens such as human immunodeficiency virus and influenza.","[Correia, Bruno E.; Baneyx, Gretchen; Jardine, Joseph G.; Kalyuzhniy, Oleksandr; Vittal, Vinayak; Stevens, Eric; Schroeter, Alexandria; MacPherson, Skye; Serra, Andreia M.; Adachi, Yumiko; Klevit, Rachel E.; Baker, David; Schief, William R.] Univ Washington, Dept Biochem, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Correia, Bruno E.] Univ Nova Lisboa, Inst Gulbenkian Ciencia, PhD Program Computat Biol, P-2780157 Oeiras, Portugal; [Correia, Bruno E.] Univ Nova Lisboa, Inst Tecnol Quim & Biol, P-2780157 Oeiras, Portugal; [Correia, Bruno E.] Scripps Res Inst, Dept Physiol Chem, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; [Bates, John T.; Crowe, James E., Jr.] Vanderbilt Univ, Vanderbilt Vaccine Ctr, Med Ctr, Nashville, TN 37232 USA; [Loomis, Rebecca J.; Connell, Mary J.; Johnson, Philip R.] Childrens Hosp Philadelphia, Res Inst, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Carrico, Chris; Rupert, Peter; Correnti, Colin; Strong, Roland K.] Fred Hutchinson Canc Res Ctr, Div Basic Sci, Seattle, WA 98109 USA; [Jardine, Joseph G.; MacPherson, Skye; Serra, Andreia M.; Li, Yuxing; Wyatt, Richard T.; Schief, William R.] Scripps Res Inst, Dept Immunol & Microbial Sci, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; [Jardine, Joseph G.; Kalyuzhniy, Oleksandr; MacPherson, Skye; Serra, Andreia M.; Adachi, Yumiko; Li, Yuxing; Wyatt, Richard T.; Schief, William R.] Scripps Res Inst, IAVI Neutralizing Antibody Ctr, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; [Jardine, Joseph G.; Kalyuzhniy, Oleksandr; MacPherson, Skye; Serra, Andreia M.; Adachi, Yumiko; Li, Yuxing; Wyatt, Richard T.; Schief, William R.] Scripps Res Inst, Ctr HIV AIDS Vaccine Immunol & Immunogen Discover, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; [Chen, Man; Graham, Barney S.] NIAID, Vaccine Res Ctr, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Crowe, James E., Jr.] Vanderbilt Univ Sch Med, Dept Pathol Microbiol & Immunol, Nashville, TN 37232 USA; [Crowe, James E., Jr.] Vanderbilt Univ Sch Med, Dept Pediat, Nashville, TN 37232 USA","Schief, WR (reprint author), Univ Washington, Dept Biochem, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.",schief@scripps.edu,"Crowe, James/B-5549-2009; Cheng, Yushao/E-6256-2011; Baker, David/K-8941-2012; Chiang, Vincent, Ming-Hsien/D-4312-2016","Crowe, James/0000-0002-0049-1079; Baker, David/0000-0001-7896-6217; Chiang, Vincent, Ming-Hsien/0000-0002-2029-7863; Carrico, Chris/0000-0003-0939-9006; Spencer, Skye/0000-0001-9570-9634","Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia [SFRH/BD/32958/2006]; National Institutes of Health NRSA Training Grant [T32CA080416]; Children's Hospital of Philadelphia; Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation CAVD award; International AIDS Vaccine Initiative Neutralizing Antibody Consortium; International AIDS Vaccine Initiative Neutralizing Antibody Center; March of Dimes; National Institutes of Health [2T32GM007270, U54 AI 005714]; National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases [P01AI094419, 5R21AI088554, 1UM1AI100663, 1R01AI102766-01A1]; National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases from the Center for AIDS Research, University of California, San Diego [P30AI36214]","We thank S.

At z > 2, supermassive black holes are thought to grow mostly by merger-driven accretion leading to high spin. It is not known, however, whether below z approximate to 1 these black holes continue to grow by coherent accretion or in a chaotic manner(5), though clear differences are predicted(3,4) in their spin evolution. An established method(6) of measuring the spin of black holes is through the study of relativistic reflection features(7) from the inner accretion disk. Owing to their greater distances from Earth, there has hitherto been no significant detection of relativistic reflection features in a moderate-redshift quasar. Here we report an analysis of archival X-ray data together with a deep observation of a gravitationally lensed quasar at z = 0.658. The emission originates within three or fewer gravitational radii from the black hole, implying a spin parameter (a measure of how fast the black hole is rotating) of a = 0.87(-0.15)(0. 08) at the 3 sigma confidence level and a > 0.66 at the 5 sigma level. The high spin found here is indicative of growth by coherent accretion for this black hole, and suggests that black-hole growth at 0.5 <= z <= 1 occurs principally by coherent rather than chaotic accretion episodes.","[Reis, R.

For this reason, the mathematical representation of properties affecting reactivity and selectivity trends, that is, molecular parameters, is paramount. Correlations produced by equating these molecular parameters with experimental outcomes are often defined as free-energy relationships and can be used to evaluate the origin of selectivity and to generate new, experimentally testable hypotheses(6,10-12). The premise behind successful correlations of this type is that a systematically perturbed molecular property affects a transition-state interaction between the catalyst, substrate and any reaction components involved in the determination of selectivity(10,11). Classic physical organic molecular descriptors, such as Hammett(4), Taft(3) or Charton(5) parameters, seek to independently probe isolated electronic or steric effects(3-6,13,14). However, these parameters cannot address simultaneous, non-additive variations to more than one molecular property, which limits their utility. Here we report a parameter system based on the vibrational response of a molecule to infrared radiation that can be used to mathematically model and predict selectivity trends for reactions with interlinked steric and electronic effects at positions of interest. The disclosed parameter system is mechanistically derived and should find broad use in the study of chemical and biological systems.","[Milo, Anat; Bess, Elizabeth N.; Sigman, Matthew S.] Univ Utah, Dept Chem, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA","Sigman, MS (reprint author), Univ Utah, Dept Chem, 315 South 1400 E, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA.",sigman@chem.utah.edu,"milo, anat/C-3255-2015","milo, anat/0000-0003-1552-8193",US National Science Foundation [CHE-0749506]; Center for High Performance Computing at the University of Utah,This work was supported by the US National Science Foundation (CHE-0749506).

The small differences in intrinsic reactivity of C-H bonds in any given organic molecule can lead to the activation of undesired C-H bonds by a non-selective catalyst. One solution to this problem is to distinguish C-H bonds on the basis of their location in the molecule relative to a specific functional group. In this context, the activation of C-H bonds five or six bonds away from a functional group by cyclometallation has been extensively studied(1-13). However, the directed activation of C-Hbonds that are distal to(more than six bonds away) functional groups has remained challenging, especially when the target C-H bond is geometrically inaccessible to directed metallation owing to the ring strain encountered in cyclometallation(14,15). Here we report a recyclable template that directs the olefination and acetoxylation of distal meta-C-H bonds-as far as 11 bonds away-of anilines and benzylicamines. This template is able to direct the meta-selective C-H functionalization of bicyclic heterocycles via a highly strained, tricyclic-cyclophane-like palladated intermediate. X-ray and nuclear magnetic resonance studies reveal that the conformational biases induced by a single fluorine substitution in the template can be enhanced by using a ligand to switch from ortho- to meta-selectivity.","[Tang, Ri-Yuan; Li, Gang; Yu, Jin-Quan] Scripps Res Inst, Dept Chem, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA","Yu, JQ (reprint author), Scripps Res Inst, Dept Chem, 10550 North Torrey Pines Rd, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA.",yu200@scripps.edu,"Li, Gang/I-2960-2012","Li, Gang/0000-0001-5229-554X",Scripps Research Institute; NIH (NIGMS) [1R01 GM102265]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [21202121],"We gratefully acknowledge The Scripps Research Institute and the NIH (NIGMS, 1R01 GM102265) for their financial support.

Theory(1) and experiments(2-4) have shown that although the water storage capacity of olivine-dominated shallow mantle is limited, the Earth's transition zone, at depths between 410 and 660 kilometres, could be a major repository for water, owing to the ability of the higher-pressure polymorphs of olivine-wadsleyite and ringwoodite-to host enough water to comprise up to around 2.5 per cent of their weight. A hydrous transition zone may have a key role in terrestrial magmatism and plate tectonics(5-7), yet despite experimental demonstration of the water-bearing capacity of these phases, geophysical probes such as electrical conductivity have provided conflicting results(8-10), and the issue of whether the transition zone contains abundant water remains highly controversial(11). Here we report X-ray diffraction, Raman and infrared spectroscopic data that provide, to our knowledge, the first evidence for the terrestrial occurrence of any higher-pressure polymorph of olivine: we find ringwoodite included in a diamond from Juina, Brazil. The water-rich nature of this inclusion, indicated by infrared absorption, along with the preservation of the ringwoodite, is direct evidence that, at least locally, the transition zone is hydrous, to about 1 weight per cent. The finding also indicates that some kimberlites must have their primary sources in this deep mantle region.","[Pearson, D.

The adoption of farming, stock breeding and sedentary societies during the Neolithic may have resulted in adaptive changes in genes associated with immunity and diet(4). However, the limited data available from earlier hunter-gatherers preclude an understanding of the selective processes associated with this crucial transition to agriculture in recent human evolution. Here we sequence an approximately 7,000-year-old Mesolithic skeleton discovered at the La Brana-Arintero site in Leon, Spain, to retrieve a complete pre-agricultural European human genome. Analysis of this genome in the context of other ancient samples suggests the existence of a common ancient genomic signature across western and central Eurasia from the Upper Paleolithic to the Mesolithic. The La Brana individual carries ancestral alleles in several skin pigmentation genes, suggesting that the light skin of modern Europeans was not yet ubiquitous in Mesolithic times. Moreover, we provide evidence that a significant number of derived, putatively adaptive variants associated with pathogen resistance in modern Europeans were already present in this hunter-gatherer.","[Olalde, Inigo; Sanchez-Quinto, Federico; Santpere, Gabriel; Prado-Martinez, Javier; Rodriguez, Juan Antonio; Quilez, Javier; Ramirez, Oscar; Marigorta, Urko M.; Fernandez-Callejo, Marcos; Navarro, Arcadi; Lalueza-Fox, Carles] CSIC UPF, Inst Biol Evolut, Barcelona 08003, Spain; [Allentoft, Morten E.; Willerslev, Eske] Univ Copenhagen, Ctr GeoGenet, Nat Hist Museum Denmark, DK-1350 Copenhagen K, Denmark; [Chiang, Charleston W.

Sex-limited mimicry is phylogenetically widespread in the swallowtail butterfly genus Papilio, in which it is often associated with female mimetic polymorphism(1-3). In multiple polymorphic species, the entire wing pattern phenotype is controlled by a single Mendelian 'supergene'(4). Although theoretical work has explored the evolutionary dynamics of supergene mimicry(5-9), there are almost no empirical data that address the critical issue of what a mimicry supergene actually is at a functional level. Using an integrative approach combining genetic and association mapping, transcriptome and genome sequencing, and gene expression analyses, we show that a single gene, doublesex, controls supergene mimicry in Papilio polytes. This is in contrast to the long-held view that supergenes are likely to be controlled by a tightly linked cluster of loci(4). Analysis of gene expression and DNA sequence variation indicates that isoform expression differences contribute to the functional differences between dsx mimicry alleles, and protein sequence evolution may also have a role. Our results combine elements from different hypotheses for the identity of supergenes, showing that a single gene can switch the entire wing pattern among mimicry phenotypes but may require multiple, tightly linked mutations to do so.","[Kunte, K.] Tata Inst Fundamental Res, Natl Ctr Biol Sci, Bengaluru 560065, Karnataka, India; [Zhang, W.; Tenger-Trolander, A.; Kronforst, M.

For some animals, song structure can vary considerably from one rendition to the next(3); neural noise within pattern generating circuits is widely assumed to be the primary source of such variability, and statistical models that incorporate neural noise are successful at reproducing the full variation present in natural songs(4). In direct contrast, here we demonstrate that much of the pattern variability in Drosophila courtship song can be explained by taking into account the dynamic sensory experience of the male. In particular, using a quantitative behavioural assay combined with computational modelling, we find that males use fast modulations in visual and self-motion signals to pattern their songs, a relationship that we show is evolutionarily conserved. Using neural circuit manipulations, we also identify the pathways involved in song patterning choices and show that females are sensitive to song features. Our data not only demonstrate that Drosophila song production is not a fixed action pattern(5,6), but establish Drosophila as a valuable new model for studies of rapid decision-making under both social and naturalistic conditions.","[Coen, Philip; Clemens, Jan; Weinstein, Andrew J.; Pacheco, Diego A.; Murthy, Mala] Princeton Univ, Princeton Neurosci Inst, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Coen, Philip; Clemens, Jan; Weinstein, Andrew J.; Pacheco, Diego A.; Murthy, Mala] Princeton Univ, Dept Mol Biol, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Deng, Yi] Princeton Univ, Dept Phys, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA","Murthy, M (reprint author), Princeton Univ, Princeton Neurosci Inst, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA.",mmurthy@princeton.edu,"Deng, Yi/F-9358-2015","Deng, Yi/0000-0002-6822-6343; COEN, PHILIP/0000-0003-1495-1061; Clemens, Jan/0000-0003-4200-8097",HHMI International Predoctoral Fellowship; Alfred P.

Agouti-related peptide (AgRP)-expressing neurons in the arcuate nucleus (ARC) at the base of the hypothalamus are crucial to the control of hunger. They are activated by caloric deficiency and, when naturally or artificially stimulated, they potently induce intense hunger and subsequent food intake(1-5). Consistent with their obligatory role in regulating appetite, genetic ablation or chemogenetic inhibition of AgRP neurons decreases feeding(3,6,7). Excitatory input to AgRP neurons is important in caloric-deficiency-induced activation, and is notable for its remarkable degree of caloric-state-dependent synaptic plasticity(8-10). Despite the important role of excitatory input, its source(s) has been unknown. Here, through the use of Cre-recombinase-enabled, cell-specific neuron mapping techniques in mice, we have discovered strong excitatory drive that, unexpectedly, emanates from the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus, specifically from subsets of neurons expressing thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) and pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP, also known as ADCYAP1). Chemogenetic stimulation of these afferent neurons in sated mice markedly activates AgRP neurons and induces intense feeding. Conversely, acute inhibition in mice with caloric-deficiency-induced hunger decreases feeding. Discovery of these afferent neurons capable of triggering hunger advances understanding of how this intense motivational state is regulated.","[Krashes, Michael J.; Shah, Bhavik P.; Madara, Joseph C.; Olson, David P.; Garfield, Alastair S.; Linh Vong; Lowell, Bradford B.] Harvard Univ, Beth Israel Deaconess Med Ctr, Sch Med, Div Endocrinol Diabet & Metab,Dept Med, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Strochlic, David E.; Liberles, Stephen D.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Cell Biol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Strochlic, David E.; Uchida, Naoshige; Liberles, Stephen D.; Lowell, Bradford B.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Program Neurosci, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Garfield, Alastair S.] Univ Edinburgh, Ctr Integrat Physiol, Edinburgh EH8 9XD, Midlothian, Scotland; [Pei, Hongjuan] Univ Michigan, Div Pediat Endocrinol, Dept Pediat, Ann Arbor, MI 48105 USA; [Watabe-Uchida, Mitsuko; Uchida, Naoshige] Harvard Univ, Ctr Brain Sci, Dept Mol & Cellular Biol, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA","Lowell, BB (reprint author), Harvard Univ, Beth Israel Deaconess Med Ctr, Sch Med, Div Endocrinol Diabet & Metab,Dept Med, Boston, MA 02215 USA.",blowell@bidmc.harvard.edu,,"Olson, David/0000-0001-9249-7760; Uchida, Naoshige/0000-0002-5755-9409","NIH [R01 DK096010, R01 DK089044, R01 DK071051, R01 DK075632, R37 DK053477, P30 DK046200, P30 DK57521, F32 DK089710, K08 DK071561, F32 DK078478, R01 MH095953]; ADA","This research was funded by the following NIH grants to B.

A third paralogue, Mycl1, is dispensable for normal embryonic development but its biological function has remained unclear(4). To examine the in vivo function of Mycl1 in mice, we generated an inactivating Mycl1(gfp) allele that also reports Mycl1 expression. We find that Mycl1 is selectively expressed in dendritic cells (DCs) of the immune system and controlled by IRF8, and that during DC development, Mycl1 expression is initiated in the common DC progenitor(5) concurrent with reduction in c-Myc expression. Mature DCs lack expression of c-Myc and N-Myc but maintain L-Myc expression even in the presence of inflammatory signals such as granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor. All DC subsets develop in Mycl1-deficient mice, but some subsets such as migratory CD103(+) conventional DCs in the lung and liver are greatly reduced at steady state. Importantly, loss of L-Myc by DCs causes a significant decrease in in vivo T-cell priming during infection by Listeria monocytogenes and vesicular stomatitis virus. The replacement of c-Myc by L-Myc in immature DCs may provide for Myc transcriptional activity in the setting of inflammation that is required for optimal T-cell priming(6).","[Wumesh, K.

Transmission of malaria parasites (Plasmodium spp.) from humans to the mosquito vector requires differentiation from asexual stages replicating within red blood cells into non-dividing male and female gametocytes. Although gametocytes were first described in 1880, our understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in commitment to gametocyte formation is extremely limited, and disrupting this critical developmental transition remains a long-standing goal(1). Here we show that expression levels of the DNA-binding protein PfAP2-G correlate strongly with levels of gametocyte formation. Using independent forward and reverse genetics approaches, we demonstrate that PfAP2-G function is essential for parasite sexual differentiation. By combining genome-wide PfAP2-G cognate motif occurrence with global transcriptional changes resulting from PfAP2-G ablation, we identify early gametocyte genes as probable targets of PfAP2-G and show that their regulation by PfAP2-G is critical for their wild-type level expression. In the asexual blood-stage parasites pfap2-g appears to be among a set of epigenetically silenced loci(2,3) prone to spontaneous activation(4). Stochastic activation presents a simple mechanism for a low baseline of gametocyte production. Overall, these findings identify PfAP2-G as a master regulator of sexual-stage development in malaria parasites and mark the first discovery of a transcriptional switch controlling a differentiation decision in protozoan parasites.","[Kafsack, Bjoern F.

The molecular mechanism(s) responsible for commitment have been hitherto unknown. Here we show that PbAP2-G, a conserved member of the apicomplexan AP2 (ApiAP2) family of DNA-binding proteins, is essential for the commitment of asexually replicating forms to sexual development in Plasmodium berghei, a malaria parasite of rodents. PbAP2-G was identified from mutations in its encoding gene, PBANKA_143750, which account for the loss of sexual development frequently observed in parasites transmitted artificially by blood passage. Systematic gene deletion of conserved ApiAP2 genes in Plasmodium confirmed the role of PbAP2-G and revealed a second ApiAP2 member (PBANKA_103430, here termed PbAP2-G2) that significantly modulates but does not abolish gametocytogenesis, indicating that a cascade of ApiAP2 proteins are involved in commitment to the production and maturation of gametocytes. The data suggest a mechanism of commitment to gametocytogenesis in Plasmodium consistent with a positive feedback loop involving PbAP2-G that could be exploited to prevent the transmission of this pernicious parasite.","[Sinha, Abhinav; Hughes, Katie R.; Dickens, Nicholas J.; Religa, Agnieszka A.; Graham, Anne L.; Cameron, Rachael; Waters, Andrew P.] Univ Glasgow, Wellcome Trust Ctr Mol Parasitol, Glasgow G12 8QQ, Lanark, Scotland; [Modrzynska, Katarzyna K.; Otto, Thomas D.; Pfander, Claudia; Bushell, Ellen; Berriman, Matthew; Billker, Oliver] Wellcome Trust Sanger Inst, Cambridge CB10 1SA, England; [Kafsack, Bjorn F.

All RNA interference pathways use small single-stranded RNA(ssRNA) molecules that guide proteins of the Argonaute (Ago) family to complementary ssRNA targets: RNA-guided RNA interference(1,2). The role of prokaryotic Ago variants has remained elusive, although bioinformatics analysis has suggested their involvement in host defence(3). Here we demonstrate that Ago of the bacterium Thermus thermophilus (TtAgo) acts as a barrier for the uptake and propagation of foreign DNA. In vivo, TtAgo is loaded with 5'-phosphorylated DNA guides, 13-25 nucleotides in length, that are mostly plasmid derived and have a strong bias for a 5'-end deoxycytidine. These small interfering DNAs guide TtAgo to cleave complementary DNA strands. Hence, despite structural homology to its eukaryotic counterparts, TtAgo functions in host defence by DNA-guided DNA interference.","[Swarts, Daan C.; Jore, Matthijs M.; Westra, Edze R.; Zhu, Yifan; Janssen, Jorijn H.; Brouns, Stan J.

The strongly anisotropic plastic response of each individual grain in the aggregate results from the interactions between neighbouring grains and the continuity of material displacement across the grain boundaries. Orthorhombic olivine, which is the dominant mineral phase of the Earth's upper mantle, does not exhibit enough slip systems to accommodate a general deformation state by intracrystalline slip without inducing damage. Here we show that a more general description of the deformation process that includes the motion of rotational defects referred to as disclinations can solve the olivine deformation paradox. We use high-resolution electron backscattering diffraction (EBSD) maps of deformed olivine aggregates to resolve the disclinations. The disclinations are found to decorate grain boundaries in olivine samples deformed experimentally and in nature. We present a disclination-based model of a high-angle tilt boundary in olivine, which demonstrates that an applied shear induces grain-boundary migration through disclination motion. This new approach clarifies grain-boundary-mediated plasticity in polycrystalline aggregates. By providing the missing mechanism for describing plastic flow in olivine, this work will permit multiscale modelling of the rheology of the upper mantle, from the atomic scale to the scale of the flow.","[Cordier, Patrick] CNRS, UMR 8207, Unite Mat & Transformat, F-59650 Villeneuve Dascq, France; [Cordier, Patrick] Univ Lille 1, F-59650 Villeneuve Dascq, France; [Demouchy, Sylvie; Barou, Fabrice] CNRS, UMR 5342, Geosci Montpellier, F-34095 Montpellier, France; [Demouchy, Sylvie; Barou, Fabrice] Univ Montpellier 2, F-34095 Montpellier, France; [Beausir, Benoit; Taupin, Vincent; Fressengeas, Claude] CNRS, UMR 7239, Lab Etud Microstruct & Mecan Mat, F-57045 Metz, France; [Beausir, Benoit; Taupin, Vincent; Fressengeas, Claude] Univ Lorraine, F-57045 Metz, France","Cordier, P (reprint author), CNRS, UMR 8207, Unite Mat & Transformat, F-59650 Villeneuve Dascq, France.",patrick.cordier@univ-lille1.fr,"Cordier, Patrick/D-2357-2012; DEMOUCHY, sylvie/A-2502-2009","Cordier, Patrick/0000-0002-1883-2994; ","European Research Council under the Seventh Framework Programme (FP7-ERC) [290424-RheoMan]; Marie Curie fellowship [FP7-PEOPLE-20074-3-IRG, 230748-PoEM]; Agence Nationale de la Recherche [ANR-11-JS09-007-01]","We acknowledge financial support from the European Research Council under the Seventh Framework Programme (FP7-ERC grant number 290424-RheoMan), from a Marie Curie fellowship (FP7-PEOPLE-20074-3-IRG, grant number 230748-PoEM) and from the Agence Nationale de la Recherche (grant number ANR-11-JS09-007-01, NanoMec).",,34,32,33,5,92,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,6-Mar,2014,507,7490,,,,,51,+,,10.1038/nature13043,,11,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,AC0ZQ,WOS:000332224400040,24572356,No,,,11/20/17

Adaptive mutations respond to human immune challenge and occur primarily in antigenic epitopes, the antibody-binding domains of the viral surface protein haemagglutinin. Here we develop a fitness model for haemagglutinin that predicts the evolution of the viral population from one year to the next. Two factors are shown to determine the fitness of a strain: adaptive epitope changes and deleterious mutations outside the epitopes. We infer both fitness components for the strains circulating in a given year, using population-genetic data of all previous strains. From fitness and frequency of each strain, we predict the frequency of its descendent strains in the following year. This fitness model maps the adaptive history of influenza A and suggests a principled method for vaccine selection. Our results call for a more comprehensive epidemiology of influenza and other fast-evolving pathogens that integrates antigenic phenotypes with other viral functions coupled by genetic linkage.","[Luksza, Marta; Laessig, Michael] Univ Cologne, Inst Theoret Phys, D-50937 Cologne, Germany; [Luksza, Marta] Columbia Univ, Fairchild Ctr 607D, New York, NY 10027 USA","Lassig, M (reprint author), Univ Cologne, Inst Theoret Phys, Zulpicher Str 77, D-50937 Cologne, Germany.",lassig@thp.uni-koeln.de,,,Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft [SFB 680]; German Federal Ministry of Education and Research [0315893-Sybacol]; National Science Foundation [PHY05-51164],"We acknowledge discussions with B.

Cas9-guide RNA complexes are also effective genome engineering agents in animals and plants. Here we use single-molecule and bulk biochemical experiments to determine how Cas9-RNA interrogates DNA to find specific cleavage sites. We show that both binding and cleavage of DNA by Cas9-RNA require recognition of a short trinucleotide protospacer adjacent motif (PAM). Non-target DNA binding affinity scales with PAM density, and sequences fully complementary to the guide RNA but lacking a nearby PAM are ignored by Cas9-RNA. Competition assays provide evidence that DNA strand separation and RNA-DNA heteroduplex formation initiate at the PAM and proceed directionally towards the distal end of the target sequence. Furthermore, PAM interactions trigger Cas9 catalytic activity. These results reveal how Cas9 uses PAM recognition to quickly identify potential target sites while scanning large DNA molecules, and to regulate scission of double-stranded DNA.","[Sternberg, Samuel H.; Doudna, Jennifer A.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Chem, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Redding, Sy] Columbia Univ, Dept Chem, New York, NY 10032 USA; [Jinek, Martin; Doudna, Jennifer A.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Greene, Eric C.] Columbia Univ, Dept Biochem & Mol Biophys, New York, NY 10032 USA; [Greene, Eric C.] Columbia Univ, Howard Hughes Med Inst, New York, NY 10032 USA; [Doudna, Jennifer A.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mol & Cell Biol, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Doudna, Jennifer A.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Phys Biosci Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA","Doudna, JA (reprint author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Chem, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",ecg2108@columbia.edu; doudna@berkeley.edu,,"Jinek, Martin/0000-0002-7601-210X","National Science Foundation [MCB-1154511, MCB-1244557]; National Defense Science & Engineering Graduate Research Fellowship programs; National Institutes of Health [GM074739]","We thank P.

Previous studies have identified Arabidopsis NRT1.1 as a dual-affinity nitrate transporter that can take up nitrate over a wide range of concentrations. The mode of action of NRT1.1 is controlled by phosphorylation of a key residue, Thr 101; however, how this post-translational modification switches the transporter between two affinity states remains unclear. Here we report the crystal structure of unphosphorylated NRT1.1, which reveals an unexpected homodimer in the inward-facing conformation. In this low-affinity state, the Thr 101 phosphorylation site is embedded in a pocket immediately adjacent to the dimer interface, linking the phosphorylation status of the transporter to its oligomeric state. Using a cell-based fluorescence resonance energy transfer assay, we show that functional NRT1.1 dimerizes in the cell membrane and that the phosphomimetic mutation of Thr 101 converts the protein into a monophasic high-affinity transporter by structurally decoupling the dimer. Together with analyses of the substrate transport tunnel, our results establish a phosphorylation-controlled dimerization switch that allows NRT1.1 to uptake nitrate with two distinct affinity modes.","[Sun, Ji; Payandeh, Jian; Hinds, Thomas R.; Zheng, Ning] Univ Washington, Dept Pharmacol, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Bankston, John R.; Zagotta, William N.] Univ Washington, Dept Physiol & Biophys, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Zheng, Ning] Univ Washington, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Seattle, WA 98195 USA","Zheng, N (reprint author), Univ Washington, Dept Pharmacol, Box 357280, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.",nzheng@u.washington.edu,,,"Howard Hughes Medical Institute; National Institutes of Health [R01EY10329, NS074545]; National Science Foundation","We thank the beamline staff of the Advanced Light Source at the University of California at Berkeley.

The protostellar envelope has a flattened shape with a diameter of a thousand astronomical units (1 AU is the distance from Earth to the Sun), and is infalling and rotating(3-5). It also has a protostellar disk with a radius of 90 AU (ref. 6), from which a planetary system is expected to form(7,8). The interstellar gas, mainly consisting of hydrogen molecules, undergoes a change in density of about three orders of magnitude as it collapses from the envelope into the disk, while being heated from 10 kelvin to over 100 kelvin in the mid-plane, but it has hitherto not been possible to explore changes in chemical composition associated with this collapse. Here we report that the unsaturated hydrocarbon molecule cyclic-C3H2 resides in the infalling rotating envelope, whereas sulphur monoxide (SO) is enhanced in the transition zone at the radius of the centrifugal barrier (100 +/- 20 AU), which is the radius at which the kinetic energy of the infalling gas is converted to rotational energy. Such a drastic change in chemistry at the centrifugal barrier was not anticipated, but is probably caused by the discontinuous infalling motion at the centrifugal barrier and local heating processes there.","[Sakai, Nami; Watanabe, Yoshimasa; Yamamoto, Satoshi] Univ Tokyo, Dept Phys, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo 1130033, Japan; [Sakai, Takeshi] Univ Electrocommun, Dept Commun Engn & Informat, Chofu, Tokyo 1828585, Japan; [Hirota, Tomoya] Natl Astron Observ Japan, Mitaka, Tokyo 1818588, Japan; [Ceccarelli, Cecilia; Kahane, Claudine] Inst Planetol & Astrophys Grenoble, F-38041 Grenoble 9, France; [Bottinelli, Sandrine; Caux, Emmanuel; Demyk, Karine; Vastel, Charlotte] Univ Toulouse 3, Observ Midi Pyrenees, Univ Toulouse, IRAP, F-31062 Toulouse, France; [Bottinelli, Sandrine; Caux, Emmanuel; Demyk, Karine; Vastel, Charlotte] CNRS, IRAP, F-31028 Toulouse 4, France; [Coutens, Audrey] Univ Copenhagen, Niels Bohr Inst, DK-2100 Copenhagen, Osterbro, Denmark; [Coutens, Audrey] Univ Copenhagen, Ctr Star & Planet Format, DK-1350 Copenhagen K, Denmark; [Coutens, Audrey] Univ Copenhagen, Nat Hist Museum Denmark, DK-1350 Copenhagen K, Denmark; [Taquet, Vianney] NASA, Goddard Space Flight Ctr, Astrochem Lab, Greenbelt, MD 20771 USA; [Ohashi, Nagayoshi; Yen, Hsi-Wei] Acad Sinica, Inst Astron & Astrophys, Taipei 10617, Taiwan; [Ohashi, Nagayoshi] Natl Astron Observ Japan, Subaru Telescope, Hilo, HI 96720 USA; [Takakuwa, Shigehisa; Yen, Hsi-Wei] Natl Taiwan Univ, Inst Astrophys, Taipei 10617, Taiwan; [Aikawa, Yuri] Kobe Univ, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, Kobe, Hyogo 6578501, Japan","Sakai, N (reprint author), Univ Tokyo, Dept Phys, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo 1130033, Japan.",nami@taurus.phys.s.u-tokyo.ac.jp,"SAKAI, NAMI/G-4893-2014; Coutens, Audrey/M-4533-2014; Sakai, Nami/N-7438-2015","SAKAI, NAMI/0000-0002-3297-4497; Coutens, Audrey/0000-0003-1805-3920; Sakai, Nami/0000-0002-3297-4497; Watanabe, Yoshimasa/0000-0002-9668-3592","Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technologies of Japan [21224002, 25400223, 25108005, 24684011]; JSPS; MAEE under the Japan-France integrated action programme (SAKURA); French Agence Nationale pour la Recherche (ANR) project FORCOMS [ANR-08-BLAN-0225]; Partenariats Hubert Curien (PHC) Programme SAKURA [25765VC]","We thank T.

Efficient up-conversion of radio-frequency signals to an optical carrier would enable their transmission through optical fibres instead of through copper wires, drastically reducing losses, and would give access to the set of established quantum optical techniques that are routinely used in quantum-limited signal detection. Research in cavity optomechanics(1,2) has shown that nanomechanical oscillators can couple strongly to either microwave(3-5) or optical fields(6,7). Here we demonstrate a room-temperature optoelectromechanical transducer with both these functionalities, following a recent proposal(8) using a high-quality nanomembrane. A voltage bias of less than 10 V is sufficient to induce strong coupling(4,6,7) between the voltage fluctuations in a radio-frequency resonance circuit and the membrane's displacement, which is simultaneously coupled to light reflected off its surface. The radio-frequency signals are detected as an optical phase shift with quantum-limited sensitivity. The corresponding half-wave voltage is in the microvolt range, orders of magnitude less than that of standard optical modulators. The noise of the transducer-beyond the measured 800 pV Hz(-1/2) Johnson noise of the resonant circuit-consists of the quantum noise of light and thermal fluctuations of the membrane, dominating the noise floor in potential applications in radio astronomy and nuclear magnetic imaging. Each of these contributions is inferred to be 60 pV Hz(-1/2) when balanced by choosing an electromechanical cooperativity of similar to 150 with an optical power of 1 mW. The noise temperature of the membrane is 300 K divided by the cooperativity. For the highest observed cooperativity of 6,800, this leads to a projected noise temperature of 40 mK and a sensitivity limit of 5 pV Hz(-1/2). Our approach to all-optical, ultralow-noise detection of classical electronic signals sets the stage for coherent up-conversion of low-frequency quantum signals to the optical domain(8-11).","[Bagci, T.; Simonsen, A.; Zeuthen, E.; Appel, J.; Sorensen, A.; Usami, K.; Schliesser, A.; Polzik, E.

Because a single hydrogen bond typically has an energy between 15 and 35 kilojoules per mole, hydrogen bonding can be a strong driver of molecular assembly; this is apparent from the dominant role of hydrogen bonding in nucleic-acid base pairing, as well as in the secondary structure of proteins. Carboxylic acid functional groups, which provide two hydrogen bonds, are particularly promising and reliable in creating and maintaining surface order, and self-assembled monolayers of benzoic acids produce structure that depends on the number and relative placement of carboxylic acid groups(2-6). Here we use scanning tunnelling microscopy to study self-assembled monolayers of ferrocenecarboxylic acid (FcCOOH), and find that, rather than producing dimeric or linear structures typical of carboxylic acids, FcCOOH forms highly unusual cyclic hydrogen-bonded pentamers, which combine with simultaneously formed FcCOOH dimers to form two-dimensional quasicrystallites that exhibit local five-fold symmetry and maintain translational and rotational order (without periodicity) for distances of more than 400 angstroms.","[Wasio, Natalie A.; Quardokus, Rebecca C.; Forrest, Ryan P.; Corcelli, Steven A.; Christie, John A.; Henderson, Kenneth W.; Kandel, S.

Our ability to understand and predict changes in the forest carbon cycle-particularly net primary productivity and carbon storage-increasingly relies on models that represent biological processes across several scales of biological organization, from tree leaves to forest stands(2,3). Yet, despite advances in our understanding of productivity at the scales of leaves and stands, no consensus exists about the nature of productivity at the scale of the individual tree(4-7), in part because we lack a broad empirical assessment of whether rates of absolute tree mass growth (and thus carbon accumulation) decrease, remain constant, or increase as trees increase in size and age. Here we present a global analysis of 403 tropical and temperate tree species, showing that for most species mass growth rate increases continuously with tree size. Thus, large, old trees do not act simply as senescent carbon reservoirs but actively fix large amounts of carbon compared to smaller trees; at the extreme, a single big tree can add the same amount of carbon to the forest within a year as is contained in an entire mid-sized tree. The apparent paradoxes of individual tree growth increasing with tree size despite declining leaf-level(8-10) and stand-level(10) productivity can be explained, respectively, by increases in a tree's total leaf area that outpace declines in productivity per unit of leaf area and, among other factors, age-related reductions in population density. Our results resolve conflicting assumptions about the nature of tree growth, inform efforts to under-tand and model forest carbon dynamics, and have additional implications for theories of resource allocation(11) and plant senescence(12).","[Stephenson, N.

A kind of 'parity' is essential, as both perception-and production-based representations must form a unified interface to facilitate access to higher-order language processes such as syntax and semantics, believed to be computed in the dominant, typically left hemisphere(5,6). Although various theories have been proposed to unite perception and production(2,7), the underlying neural mechanisms are unclear. Early models of speech and language processing proposed that perceptual processing occurred in the left posterior superior temporal gyrus (Wernicke's area) and motor production processes occurred in the left inferior frontal gyrus (Broca's area)(8,9). Sensory activity was proposed to link to production activity through connecting fibre tracts, forming the left lateralized speech sensory-motor system(10). Although recent evidence indicates that speech perception occurs bilaterally(11-13), prevailing models maintain that the speech sensory-motor system is left lateralized(11,14-18) and facilitates the transformation from sensory-based auditory representations to motor-based production representations(11,15,16). However, evidence for the lateralized computation of sensory-motor speech transformations is indirect and primarily comes from stroke patients that have speech repetition deficits (conduction aphasia) and studies using covert speech and haemodynamic functional imaging(16,19). Whether the speech sensory-motor system is lateralized, like higher-order language processes, or bilateral, like speech perception, is controversial. Here we use direct neural recordings in subjects performing sensory-motor tasks involving overt speech production to show that sensory-motor transformations occur bilaterally. We demonstrate that electrodes over bilateral inferior frontal, inferior parietal, superior temporal, premotor and somatosensory cortices exhibit robust sensory-motor neural responses during both perception and production in an overt word-repetition task. Using a non-word transformation task, we show that bilateral sensory-motor responses can perform transformations between speech-perception-and speech-production-based representations. These results establish a bilateral sublexical speech sensory-motor system.","[Cogan, Gregory B.; Pesaran, Bijan] NYU, Ctr Neural Sci, New York, NY 10003 USA; [Thesen, Thomas; Carlson, Chad; Devinsky, Orrin] NYU, Sch Med, Dept Neurol, New York, NY 10016 USA; [Doyle, Werner; Devinsky, Orrin] NYU, Sch Med, Dept Neurosurg, New York, NY 10016 USA","Pesaran, B (reprint author), NYU, Ctr Neural Sci, New York, NY 10003 USA.",bijan@nyu.edu,,"Pesaran, Bijan/0000-0003-4116-0038; Devinsky, Orrin/0000-0003-0044-4632",NIDCD [R03-DC010475]; Burroughs Wellcome Fund; NYSTAR; McKnight Scholar Award; Sloan Research Fellowship,"We would like to thank A.

Rings form after fusion of the long and short arms of a chromosome, and are sometimes associated with large terminal deletions(2). Owing to the severity of these large aberrations that can affect multiple contiguous genes, no possible therapeutic strategies for ring chromosome disorders have been proposed. During cell division, ring chromosomes can exhibit unstable behaviour leading to continuous production of aneuploid progeny with low viability and high cellular death rate(3-9). The overall consequences of this chromosomal instability have been largely unexplored in experimental model systems. Here we generated human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs)(10-12) from patient fibroblasts containing ring chromosomes with large deletions and found that reprogrammed cells lost the abnormal chromosome and duplicated the wild-type homologue through the compensatory uniparental disomy (UPD) mechanism. The karyotypically normal iPSCs with isodisomy for the corrected chromosome outgrew co-existing aneuploid populations, enabling rapid and efficient isolation of patient-derived iPSCs devoid of the original chromosomal aberration. Our results suggest a fundamentally different function for cellular reprogramming as a means of 'chromosome therapy'(13) to reverse combined loss-of-function across many genes in cells with large-scale aberrations involving ring structures. In addition, our work provides an experimentally tractable human cellular system for studying mechanisms of chromosomal number control, which is of critical relevance to human development and disease.","[Bershteyn, Marina; Wynshaw-Boris, Anthony] Univ Calif San Francisco, Inst Human Genet, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; [Bershteyn, Marina; Wynshaw-Boris, Anthony] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Pediat, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; [Bershteyn, Marina; Kriegstein, Arnold R.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Eli & Edythe Broad Ctr Regenerat Med & Stem Cell, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; [Hayashi, Yohei; Sami, Salma; Yamanaka, Shinya] Gladstone Inst Cardiovasc Dis, San Francisco, CA 94158 USA; [Hayashi, Yohei; Sami, Salma; Yamanaka, Shinya] Roddenberry Ctr Stem Cell Biol & Med Gladstone, San Francisco, CA 94158 USA; [Desachy, Guillaume; Tsang, Kathryn M.; Weiss, Lauren A.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Inst Human Genet, Dept Psychiat, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; [Hsiao, Edward C.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Div Endocrinol & Metab, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; [Hsiao, Edward C.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Inst Human Genet, Dept Med, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; [Yamanaka, Shinya] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Anat, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; [Yamanaka, Shinya] Kyoto Univ, Dept Reprogramming Sci, Ctr iPS Cell Res & Applicat, Kyoto 6068507, Japan; [Wynshaw-Boris, Anthony] Case Western Reserve Univ, Dept Genet & Genome Sci, Cleveland, OH 44106 USA","Wynshaw-Boris, A (reprint author), Univ Calif San Francisco, Inst Human Genet, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA.",syamanaka@gladstone.ucsf.edu; ajw168@case.edu,,"Hayashi, Yohei/0000-0001-5490-7052",NIH/NIGMS [GM007085-32]; California Institute for Regenerative Medicine [TG2-01153]; Uehara Memorial Foundation; USCF's Program for Breakthrough Biomedical Research; NIAMS/NIH [K08 AR056299]; UCSF Department of Medicine; NHLBI/NIH [UO1HL098179]; MEXT (Japan); JSPS (Japan); JSPS; NIBIO (Japan); L.

This modification leads to the loss of a positive charge and reduction in hydrogen-bonding ability. It is carried out by a small family of tissue-specific vertebrate enzymes called peptidylarginine deiminases (PADIs)(2) and is associated with the development of diverse pathological states such as autoimmunity, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, prion diseases and thrombosis(2,3). Nevertheless, the physiological functions of citrullination remain ill-defined, although citrullination of core histones has been linked to transcriptional regulation and the DNA damage response(4-8). PADI4 (also called PAD4 or PADV), the only PADI with a nuclear localization signal(9), was previously shown to act in myeloid cells where it mediates profound chromatin decondensation during the innate immune response to infection(10). Here we show that the expression and enzymatic activity of Padi4 are also induced under conditions of ground-state pluripotency and during reprogramming in mouse. Padi4 is part of the pluripotency transcriptional network, binding to regulatory elements of key stem-cell genes and activating their expression. Its inhibition lowers the percentage of pluripotent cells in the early mouse embryo and significantly reduces reprogramming efficiency. Using an unbiased proteomic approach we identify linker histone H1 variants, which are involved in the generation of compact chromatin(11), as novel PADI4 substrates. Citrullination of a single arginine residue within the DNA-binding site of H1 results in its displacement from chromatin and global chromatin decondensation.

The ability of UV radiation to cause tumour-initiating DNA mutations in melanocytes is now firmly established(2), but how the microenvironmental effects of UV radiation(3,4) influence melanoma pathogenesis is not fully understood. Here we report that repetitive UV exposure of primary cutaneous melanomas in a genetically engineered mouse model(5) promotes metastatic progression, independent of its tumour-initiating effects. UV irradiation enhanced the expansion of tumour cells along abluminal blood vessel surfaces and increased the number of lung metastases. This effect depended on the recruitment and activation of neutrophils, initiated by the release of high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) from UV-damaged epidermal keratinocytes and driven by Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4). The UV-induced neutrophilic inflammatory response stimulated angiogenesis and promoted the ability of melanoma cells to migrate towards endothelial cells and use selective motility cues on their surfaces. Our results not only reveal how UV irradiation of epidermal keratinocytes is sensed by the innate immune system, but also show that the resulting inflammatory response catalyses reciprocal melanoma-endothelial cell interactions leading to perivascular invasion, a phenomenon originally described as angiotropism in human melanomas by histopathologists(6). Angiotropism represents a hitherto underappreciated mechanism of metastasis(7) that also increases the likelihood of intravasation and haematogenous dissemination. Consistent with our findings, ulcerated primary human melanomas with abundant neutrophils and reactive angiogenesis frequently show angiotropism and a high risk for metastases. Our work indicates that targeting the inflammation-induced phenotypic plasticity of melanoma cells and their association with endothelial cells represent rational strategies to specifically interfere with metastatic progression.","[Bald, Tobias; Landsberg, Jennifer; Rogava, Meri; Glodde, Nicole; Lopez-Ramos, Dorys; Kohlmeyer, Judith; Gaffal, Evelyn; Tueting, Thomas] Univ Bonn, Dept Dermatol & Allergy, Lab Expt Dermatol, D-53115 Bonn, Germany; [Quast, Thomas; Schadow, Benjamin; Weighardt, Heike; Foerster, Irmgard; Kolanus, Waldemar] Univ Bonn, Life & Med Sci Inst, D-53115 Bonn, Germany; [Riesenberg, Stefanie; van den Boorn-Konijnenberg, Debby; Hoemig-Hoelzel, Cornelia; Hoelzel, Michael] Univ Bonn, Dept Clin Chem & Clin Pharmacol, Unit RNA Biol, D-53105 Bonn, Germany; [Reuten, Raphael; Koch, Manuel] Univ Cologne, Inst Dent Res & Oral Musculoskeletal Biol, Fac Med, Ctr Biochem, D-50931 Cologne, Germany; [Wenzel, Daniela; Fleischmann, Bernd K.] Univ Bonn, Life & Brain Ctr, Inst Physiol 1, D-53105 Bonn, Germany; [Helfrich, Iris; Schadendorf, Dirk] Univ Hosp Essen, Dept Dermatol, D-45122 Essen, Germany; [Bloch, Wilhelm] German Sport Univ Cologne, Inst Cardiovasc Res & Sport Med, Dept Mol & Cellular Sport Med, D-50933 Cologne, Germany; [Bianchi, Marco E.] San Raffaele Univ & Sci Inst, Div Genet & Cell Biol, I-20132 Milan, Italy; [Lugassy, Claire; Barnhill, Raymond L.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Med Ctr, Jonsson Comprehens Canc Ctr, Dept Pathol & Lab Med, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Kastenmueller, Wolfgang] Univ Bonn, Inst Mol Med & Expt Immunol, D-53105 Bonn, Germany","Holzel, M (reprint author), Univ Bonn, Dept Clin Chem & Clin Pharmacol, Unit RNA Biol, D-53105 Bonn, Germany.",michael.hoelzel@ukb.uni-bonn.de; evelyn.gaffal@ukb.uni-bonn.de; thomas.tueting@ukb.uni-bonn.de,"Wenzel, Daniela/B-7613-2014; Forster, Irmgard/P-8545-2016","Wenzel, Daniela/0000-0003-1100-6363; Forster, Irmgard/0000-0002-7644-5642; Bianchi, Marco Emilio/0000-0002-5329-6445; Bald, Tobias/0000-0003-0061-235X","Deutsche Krebshilfe P9 in the Melanoma Research Network; DFG [SFB832, SFB704, HO 4281/2-1, SFB829, SFB829 Z2]; BONFOR; NRW junior research group; Jurgen Manchot Stiftung; AIRC","We would like to thank the following individuals for their support: G.

It is also found in some non-photosynthetic bacteria(4), and SQ is part of the surface layer of some Archaea(5). The estimated annual production of SQ(4) is 10,000,000,000 tonnes (10 petagrams), thus it comprises a major portion of the organo-sulphur in nature, where SQ is degraded by bacteria(6,7). However, despite evidence for at least three different degradative pathways in bacteria(6-8), no enzymic reaction or gene in any pathway has been defined, although a sulphoglycolytic pathway has been proposed(7). Here we show that Escherichia coli K-12, the most widely studied prokaryotic model organism, performs sulphoglycolysis, in addition to standard glycolysis. SQ is catabolised through four newly discovered reactions that we established using purified, heterologously expressed enzymes: SQ isomerase, 6-deoxy-6-sulphofructose (SF) kinase, 6-deoxy-6-sulphofructose-1-phosphate (SFP) aldolase, and 3-sulpholactaldehyde (SLA) reductase. The enzymes are encoded in a ten-gene cluster, which probably also encodes regulation, transport and degradation of the whole sulpholipid; the gene cluster is present in almost all (>91%) available E. coli genomes, and is wide-spread in Enterobacteriaceae. The pathway yields dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP), which powers energy conservation and growth of E. coli, and the sulphonate product 2,3-dihydroxypropane-1-sulphonate (DHPS), which is excreted. DHPS is mineralized by other bacteria, thus closing the sulphur cycle within a bacterial community.","[Denger, Karin; Spiteller, Dieter; Cook, Alasdair M.; Schleheck, David] Univ Konstanz, Dept Biol, D-78457 Constance, Germany; [Weiss, Michael; Felux, Ann-Katrin] Univ Konstanz, Konstanz Res Sch Chem Biol, D-78457 Constance, Germany; [Schneider, Alexander; Mayer, Christoph] Univ Tubingen, Interfac Inst Microbiol & Infect Med, D-72076 Tubingen, Germany; [Huhn, Thomas] Univ Konstanz, Dept Chem, D-78457 Constance, Germany","Cook, AM (reprint author), Univ Konstanz, Dept Biol, D-78457 Constance, Germany.",alasdair.cook@uni-konstanz.de; david.schleheck@uni-konstanz.de,"Huhn, Thomas/A-2708-2009; Mayer, Christoph/S-8666-2017","Huhn, Thomas/0000-0001-6292-4215; Mayer, Christoph/0000-0003-4731-4851","Konstanz Research School Chemical Biology (KoRS-CB); German Research Foundation (DFG) [MA2436/4, SFB766/A15]; Baden-Wurttemberg Stiftung [P-BWS-Glyko11]; DFG [SCHL 1936/1-1]; University of Konstanz; Konstanz Young Scholar Fund","We thank E.

T-cell signalling is initiated at these contacts when surface-expressed T-cell receptors (TCRs) recognize peptide fragments (antigens) of pathogens bound to major histocompatibility complex molecules (pMHC) on APCs. This, along with engagement of adhesion receptors, leads to the formation of a specialized junction between T cells and APCs, known as the immunological synapse(2), which mediates efficient delivery of effector molecules and intercellular signals across the synaptic cleft(3). T-cell recognition of pMHC and the adhesion ligand intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) on supported planar bilayers recapitulates the domain organization of the immunological synapse(4,5), which is characterized by central accumulation of TCRs(5), adjacent to a secretory domain(2), both surrounded by an adhesive ring(4,5). Although accumulation of TCRs at the immunological synapse centre correlates with T-cell function(4), this domain is itself largely devoid of TCR signalling activity(5,6), and is characterized by an unexplained immobilization of TCR-pMHC complexes relative to the highly dynamic immunological synapse periphery(4,5). Here we show that centrally accumulated TCRs are located on the surface of extracellular microvesicles that bud at the immunological synapse centre. Tumour susceptibility gene 101 (TSG101)(6) sorts TCRs for inclusion in microvesicles, whereas vacuolar protein sorting 4 (VPS4)(7,8) mediates scission of microvesicles from the T-cell plasma membrane. The human immunodeficiency virus polyprotein Gag co-opts this process for budding of virus-like particles. B cells bearing cognate pMHC receive TCRs from T cells and initiate intracellular signals in response to isolated synaptic microvesicles. We conclude that the immunological synapse orchestrates TCR sorting and release in extracellular microvesicles. These microvesicles deliver transcellular signals across antigen-dependent synapses by engaging cognate pMHC on APCs.","[Choudhuri, Kaushik] Skirball Inst Biomol Med, Program Mol Pathogenesis, Helen L & Martin S Kimmel Ctr Biol & Med, New York, NY 10016 USA; [Llodra, Jaime; Stokes, David L.] Skirball Inst Biomol Med, Program Struct Biol, Helen L & Martin S Kimmel Ctr Biol & Med, New York, NY 10016 USA; [Roth, Eric W.] Northwestern Univ, Atom & Nanoscale Characterizat Expt Ctr, Evanston, IL 60208 USA; [Tsai, Jones; Kam, Lance C.] Columbia Univ, Dept Biomed Engn, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Gordo, Susana; Wucherpfennig, Kai W.] Dana Farber Canc Inst, Dept Canc Immunol & AIDS, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Gordo, Susana; Wucherpfennig, Kai W.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Program Immunol, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Stokes, David L.] New York Struct Biol Ctr, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Dustin, Michael L.] NYU, Sch Med, Dept Pathol, New York, NY 10016 USA; [Dustin, Michael L.] Univ Oxford, Kennedy Inst Rheumatol, Nuffield Dept Orthopaed Rheumatol & Musculoskelet, Oxford OX3 7FY, England","Dustin, ML (reprint author), NYU, Sch Med, Dept Pathol, 540 First Ave, New York, NY 10016 USA.",stokes@nyu.edu; michael.dustin@kennedy.ox.ac.uk,,"Dustin, Michael/0000-0003-4983-6389","New York Structural Biology Center; Cancer Research Institute; NIH [K99AI093884, AI043542, AI045757, AI055037, AI088377, AI093884, EY016586]; Wellcome Trust; Kennedy Trust","We thank G.

Pol V transcripts are thought to interact with siRNAs which then recruit DOMAINS REARRANGED METHYLTRANSFERASE 2 (DRM2) to methylate DNA(3-7). The SU(VAR) 3-9 homologues SUVH2 and SUVH9 act in this downstream step but the mechanism of their action is unknown(8,9). Here we show that genome-wide Pol V association with chromatin redundantly requires SUVH2 and SUVH9. Although SUVH2 and SUVH9 resemble histone methyltransferases, a crystal structure reveals that SUVH9 lacks a peptide-substrate binding cleft and lacks a properly formed S-adenosyl methionine (SAM)-binding pocket necessary for normal catalysis, consistent with a lack of methyltransferase activity for these proteins(8). SUVH2 and SUVH9 both contain SRA (SET- and RING-ASSOCIATED) domains capable of binding methylated DNA(8), suggesting that they function to recruit Pol V through DNA methylation. Consistent with this model, mutation of DNA METHYLTRANSFERASE 1 (MET1) causes loss of DNA methylation, a nearly complete loss of Pol V at its normal locations, and redistribution of Pol V to sites that become hypermethylated. Furthermore, tethering SUVH2 with a zinc finger to an unmethylated site is sufficient to recruit Pol V and establish DNA methylation and gene silencing. These results indicate that Pol V is recruited to DNA methylation through the methyl-DNA binding SUVH2 and SUVH9 proteins, and our mechanistic findings suggest a means for selectively targeting regions of plant genomes for epigenetic silencing.","[Johnson, Lianna M.; Hale, Christopher J.; Bischof, Sylvain; Feng, Suhua; Chodavarapu, Ramakrishna K.; Zhong, Xuehua; Pellegrini, Matteo; Jacobsen, Steven E.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Mol Cell & Dev Biol, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Du, Jiamu; Marson, Giuseppe; Patel, Dinshaw J.] Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Struct Biol Program, New York, NY 10065 USA; [Feng, Suhua; Jacobsen, Steven E.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Segal, David J.] Univ Calif Davis, Genome Ctr, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Segal, David J.] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Biochem & Mol Med, Davis, CA 95616 USA","Jacobsen, SE (reprint author), Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Mol Cell & Dev Biol, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.",pateld@mskcc.org; jacobsen@ucla.edu,"Du, Jiamu/I-1334-2013","Du, Jiamu/0000-0002-1337-0786; Segal, David/0000-0001-8962-3105",Abby Rockefeller Mauze Trust; Maloris foundation; STARR foundation; NIH [GM60398]; Damon Runyon post-doctoral fellowship; Swiss National Science Foundation; Ruth L.

Current standard therapy comprises surgery and radiation, but not cytotoxic chemotherapy as it does not further increase survival. Whole-genome and whole-exome sequencing of 47 hindbrain ependymomas reveals an extremely low mutation rate, and zero significant recurrent somatic single nucleotide variants. Although devoid of recurrent single nucleotide variants and focal copy number aberrations, poor-prognosis hindbrain ependymomas exhibit a CpG island methylator phenotype. Transcriptional silencing driven by CpG methylation converges exclusively on targets of the Polycomb repressive complex 2 which represses expression of differentiation genes through trimethylation of H3K27. CpG island methylator phenotype-positive hindbrain ependymomas are responsive to clinical drugs that target either DNA or H3K27 methylation both in vitro and in vivo. We conclude that epigenetic modifiers are the first rational therapeutic candidates for this deadly malignancy, which is epigenetically deregulated but genetically bland.","[Mack, S.

Although constitutive NF-kappa B signalling is present in most human tumours, mutations in pathway members are rare, complicating efforts to understand and block aberrant NF-kappa B activity in cancer. Here we show that more than two-thirds of supratentorial ependymomas contain oncogenic fusions between RELA, the principal effector of canonical NF-kappa B signalling, and an uncharacterized gene, C11orf95. In each case, C11orf95-RELA fusions resulted from chromothripsis involving chromosome 11q13.1. C11orf95-RELA fusion proteins translocated spontaneously to the nucleus to activate NF-kappa B target genes, and rapidly transformed neural stem cells-the cell of origin of ependymoma-to form these tumours in mice. Our data identify a highly recurrent genetic alteration of RELA in human cancer, and the C11orf95-RELA fusion protein as a potential therapeutic target in supratentorial ependymoma.","[Parker, Matthew; Dalton, James D.; Li, Yongjin; Tatevossian, Ruth G.; Tang, Bo; Orisme, Wilda; Boggs, Kristy; Yergeau, Donald; Vadodaria, Bhavin; Mulder, Heather L.; Ma, Jing; Song, Guangchun; Gajjar, Amar; Ding, Li; Lu, Charles; Ochoa, Kerri; Zhao, David; Fulton, Robert S.; Fulton, Lucinda L.; Mardis, Elaine R.; Wilson, Richard K.; Downing, James R.; Zhang, Jinghui; Ellison, David W.; Gilbertson, Richard J.] Washington Univ, St Jude Childrens Res Hosp, Pediat Canc Genome Project, Memphis, TN 38105 USA; [Parker, Matthew; Li, Yongjin; Rusch, Michael; Chen, Xiang; Li, Yuxin; Nagahawhatte, Panduka; Hedlund, Erin; Finkelstein, David; Wu, Gang; Gupta, Pankaj; Zhao, David; Zhang, Jinghui] St Jude Childrens Res Hosp, Dept Computat Biol & Bioinformat, Memphis, TN 38105 USA; [Mohankumar, Kumarasamypet M.; Phoenix, Timothy N.; Thiruvenkatam, Radhika; White, Elsie; Gilbertson, Richard J.] St Jude Childrens Res Hosp, Dept Dev Neurobiol, Memphis, TN 38105 USA; [Punchihewa, Chandanamali; Dalton, James D.; Lee, Ryan; Tatevossian, Ruth G.; Tang, Bo; Orisme, Wilda; Gupta, Kirti; Shurtleff, Sheila; Easton, John; Becksford, Jared; Downing, James R.; Ellison, David W.] St Jude Childrens Res Hosp, Dept Pathol, Memphis, TN 38105 USA; [Weinlich, Ricardo; Green, Douglas R.] St Jude Childrens Res Hosp, Dept Immunol, Memphis, TN 38105 USA; [Li, Yuxin; Huether, Robert] St Jude Childrens Res Hosp, Memphis, TN 38105 USA; [Gajjar, Amar] St Jude Childrens Res Hosp, Dept Oncol, Memphis, TN 38105 USA; [Merchant, Thomas] St Jude Childrens Res Hosp, Dept Radiol Sci, Memphis, TN 38105 USA; [Boop, Frederick] St Jude Childrens Res Hosp, Dept Surg, Memphis, TN 38105 USA; [Smith, Amy A.] MD Anderson Canc Ctr Orlando, Orlando, FL 32806 USA; [Ding, Li; Lu, Charles; Ochoa, Kerri; Fulton, Robert S.; Fulton, Lucinda L.; Mardis, Elaine R.; Wilson, Richard K.] Washington Univ, Sch Med St Louis, Genome Inst, St Louis, MO 63108 USA; [Ding, Li; Ochoa, Kerri; Fulton, Lucinda L.; Mardis, Elaine R.; Wilson, Richard K.] Washington Univ, Sch Med St Louis, Dept Genet, St Louis, MO 63108 USA; [Mardis, Elaine R.; Wilson, Richard K.] Washington Univ, Sch Med St Louis, Siteman Canc Ctr, St Louis, MO 63108 USA","Gilbertson, RJ (reprint author), Washington Univ, St Jude Childrens Res Hosp, Pediat Canc Genome Project, Memphis, TN 38105 USA.",Jinghui.Zhang@stjude.org; David.Ellison@stjude.org; Richard.Gilbertson@stjude.org,"LI, YONGJIN/E-1688-2011; Huether, Robert/E-9638-2012; Tatevossian, Ruth/G-6377-2016; Li, Yuxin/K-9197-2016; Weinlich, Ricardo/S-7495-2016","Huether, Robert/0000-0001-7077-7470; Tatevossian, Ruth/0000-0002-1653-3026; Lee, Ryan/0000-0002-2517-9559","St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Washington University Pediatric Cancer Genome Project; National Institutes of Health [R01CA129541, P01CA96832, P30CA021765]; Collaborative Ependymoma Research Network (CERN); American Lebanese Syrian Associated Charities (ALSAC)","This research was supported as part of the St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Washington University Pediatric Cancer Genome Project.

A single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) encoding a missense variant in the autophagy gene ATG16L1 (rs2241880, Thr300Ala) is strongly associated with the incidence of Crohn's disease. Numerous studies have demonstrated the effect of ATG16L1 deletion or deficiency; however, the molecular consequences of the Thr300Ala (T300A) variant remains unknown. Here we show that amino acids 296-299 constitute a caspase cleavage motif in ATG16L1 and that the T300A variant (T316A in mice) significantly increases ATG16L1 sensitization to caspase-3-mediated processing. We observed that death-receptor activation or starvation-induced metabolic stress in human and murine macrophages increased degradation of the T300A or T316A variants of ATG16L1, respectively, resulting in diminished autophagy. Knock-in mice harbouring the T316A variant showed defective clearance of the ileal pathogen Yersinia enterocolitica and an elevated inflammatory cytokine response. In turn, deletion of the caspase-3-encoding gene, Casp3, or elimination of the caspase cleavage site by site-directed mutagenesis rescued starvation-induced autophagy and pathogen clearance, respectively. These findings demonstrate that caspase 3 activation in the presence of a common risk allele leads to accelerated degradation of ATG16L1, placing cellular stress, apoptotic stimuli and impaired autophagy in a unified pathway that predisposes to Crohn's disease.","[Murthy, Aditya; Li, Yun; Peng, Ivan; Noubade, Rajkumar; DeVoss, Jason; Campagne, Menno van Lookeren] Genentech Inc, Dept Immunol, San Francisco, CA 94080 USA; [Reichelt, Mike; Katakam, Anand Kumar; Diehl, Lauri] Genentech Inc, Dept Pathol, San Francisco, CA 94080 USA; [Roose-Girma, Merone] Genentech Inc, Dept Mol Biol, San Francisco, CA 94080 USA; [Graham, Robert R.] Genentech Inc, ITGR Human Genet, San Francisco, CA 94080 USA","Campagne, MV (reprint author), Genentech Inc, Dept Immunol, 1 DNA Way, San Francisco, CA 94080 USA.",menno@gene.com,,,,,,46,107,112,1,47,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,27-Feb,2014,506,7489,,,,,456,+,,10.1038/nature13044,,20,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,AC0DN,WOS:000332165100031,24553140,No,,,11/20/17

Such supernovae yield large quantities of light elements such as carbon but very little iron. The dominance of low-energy supernovae seems surprising, because it had been expected that the first stars were extremely massive, and that they disintegrated in pair-instability explosions that would rapidly enrich galaxies in iron(5). What has remained unclear is the yield of iron from the first supernovae, because hitherto no star has been unambiguously interpreted as encapsulating the yield of a single supernova. Here we report the optical spectrum of SMSS J031300.36-670839.3, which shows no evidence of iron (with an upper limit of 10(-7.1) times solar abundance). Based on a comparison of its abundance pattern with those of models, we conclude that the star was seeded with material from a single supernova with an original mass about 60 times that of the Sun (and that the supernova left behind a black hole). Taken together with the four previously mentioned low-metallicity stars, we conclude that low-energy supernovae were common in the early Universe, and that such supernovae yielded light-element enrichment with insignificant iron. Reduced stellar feedback both chemically and mechanically from low-energy supernovae would have enabled first-generation stars to form over an extended period. We speculate that such stars may perhaps have had an important role in the epoch of cosmic reionization and the chemical evolution of early galaxies.","[Keller, S. C.; Bessell, M. S.; Casey, A.

Among the seemingly fundamental constants that parameterize the Standard Model of physics(5) and which are thus responsible for its predictive power, the electron mass m(e) is prominent, being responsible for the structure and properties of atoms and molecules. It is closely linked to other fundamental constants, such as the Rydberg constant R-infinity and the fine-structure constant alpha (ref. 6). However, the low mass of the electron considerably complicates its precise determination. Here we combine a very precise measurement of the magnetic moment of a single electron bound to a carbon nucleus with a state-of-the-art calculation in the framework of bound-state quantum electrodynamics. The precision of the resulting value for the atomic mass of the electron surpasses the current literature value of the Committee on Data for Science and Technology (CODATA(6)) by a factor of 13. This result lays the foundation for future fundamental physics experiments(7,8) and precision tests of the Standard Model(9-11).","[Sturm, S.; Koehler, F.; Zatorski, J.; Wagner, A.; Harman, Z.; Keitel, C.

It is often possible to incorporate interactions in theoretical treatments of crystalline solids by introducing suitable quasiparticles that have an effective mass, spin or charge(4,5) which in turn affects the material's conductivity, optical response or phase transitions(2,6,7). Additional quasiparticle interactions may also create strongly correlated configurations yielding new macroscopic phenomena, such as the emergence of a Mott insulator(8), superconductivity or the pseudogap phase of high-temperature superconductors(9-11). In semiconductors, a conduction-band electron attracts a valence-band hole (electronic vacancy) to create a bound pair, known as an exciton(12,13), which is yet another quasiparticle. Two excitons may also bind together to give molecules, often referred to as biexcitons(14), and even polyexcitons may exist(15,16). In indirect-gap semiconductors such as germanium or silicon, a thermodynamic phase transition may produce electron-hole droplets whose diameter can approach the micrometre range(17,18). In direct-gap semiconductors such as gallium arsenide, the exciton lifetime is too short for such a thermodynamic process. Instead, different quasiparticle configurations are stabilized dominantly by many-body interactions, not by thermalization. The resulting non-equilibrium quantum kinetics is so complicated that stable aggregates containing three or more Coulomb-correlated electron-hole pairs remain mostly unexplored. Here we study such complex aggregates and identify a new stable configuration of charged particles that we call a quantum droplet. This configuration exists in a plasma and exhibits quantization owing to its small size. It is charge neutral and contains a small number of particles with a pair-correlation function that is characteristic of a liquid. We present experimental and theoretical evidence for the existence of quantum droplets in an electron-hole plasma created in a gallium arsenide quantum well by ultrashort optical pulses.","[Almand-Hunter, A.

Their condensable oxidation products can form secondary organic aerosol, a significant and ubiquitous component of atmospheric aerosol(1,2), which is known to affect the Earth's radiation balance by scattering solar radiation and by acting as cloud condensation nuclei(3). The quantitative assessment of such climate effects remains hampered by a number of factors, including an incomplete understanding of how biogenic VOCs contribute to the formation of atmospheric secondary organic aerosol. The growth of newly formed particles from sizes of less than three nanometres up to the sizes of cloud condensation nuclei (about one hundred nanometres) in many continental ecosystems requires abundant, essentially nonvolatile organic vapours(4-6), but the sources and compositions of such vapours remain unknown. Here we investigate the oxidation of VOCs, in particular the terpene alpha-pinene, under atmospherically relevant conditions in chamber experiments. We find that a direct pathway leads from several biogenic VOCs, such as monoterpenes, to the formation of large amounts of extremely low-volatility vapours. These vapours format significant mass yield in the gas phase and condense irreversibly onto aerosol surfaces to produce secondary organic aerosol, helping to explain the discrepancy between the observed atmospheric burden of secondary organic aerosol and that reported by many model studies(2). We further demonstrate how these low-volatility vapours can enhance, or even dominate, the formation and growth of aerosol particles over forested regions, providing a missing link between biogenic VOCs and their conversion to aerosol particles. Our findings could help to improve assessments of biosphere-aerosol-climate feedback mechanisms(6-8), and the air quality and climate effects of biogenic emissions generally.","[Ehn, Mikael; Pullinen, Iida; Springer, Monika; Rubach, Florian; Tillmann, Ralf; Andres, Stefanie; Acir, Ismail-Hakki; Wahner, Andreas; Mentel, Thomas F.] Forschungszentrum Julich, Inst Energy & Climate Res IEK 8, D-52425 Julich, Germany; [Ehn, Mikael; Thornton, Joel A.; Sipila, Mikko; Junninen, Heikki; Rissanen, Matti; Jokinen, Tuija; Schobesberger, Siegfried; Kangasluoma, Juha; Kontkanen, Jenni; Nieminen, Tuomo; Petaja, Tuukka; Kerminen, Veli-Matti; Kulmala, Markku; Worsnop, Douglas R.] Univ Helsinki, Dept Phys, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland; [Thornton, Joel A.; Lee, Ben; Lopez-Hilfiker, Felipe] Univ Washington, Dept Atmospher Sci, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Kleist, Einhard; Wildt, Juergen] Forschungszentrum Julich, Inst Bio & Geosci IBG 2, D-52425 Julich, Germany; [Jokinen, Tuija; Berndt, Torsten] Inst Tropospher Res TROPOS, D-04318 Leipzig, Germany; [Nieminen, Tuomo] Univ Helsinki, Helsinki Inst Phys, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland; [Kurten, Theo] Univ Helsinki, Dept Chem, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland; [Nielsen, Lasse B.; Jorgensen, Solvejg; Kjaergaard, Henrik G.] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Chem, DK-2100 Copenhagen O, Denmark; [Canagaratna, Manjula; Worsnop, Douglas R.] Aerodyne Res Inc, Billerica, MA 01821 USA; [Dal Maso, Miikka] Tampere Univ Technol, Dept Phys, FIN-33101 Tampere, Finland","Ehn, M (reprint author), Forschungszentrum Julich, Inst Energy & Climate Res IEK 8, D-52425 Julich, Germany.",mikael.ehn@helsinki.fi,"; Mentel, Thomas/A-3576-2011; Jorgensen, Solvejg/A-1246-2011; Worsnop, Douglas/D-2817-2009; Lee, Ben/G-7007-2014; Kjaergaard, Henrik /H-4333-2014; Petaja, Tuukka/A-8009-2008; Tillmann, Ralf/I-9203-2012; Schobesberger, Siegfried/L-4454-2014; Kerminen, Veli-Matti/M-9026-2014; Wahner, Andreas/J-4129-2012; Kurten, Theo/G-2120-2012; Sipila, Mikko/G-3024-2010; Jokinen, Tuija/B-3365-2014; Dal Maso, Miikka/A-7980-2008; Kulmala, Markku/I-7671-2016; Ehn, Mikael/N-2571-2016; Thornton, Joel/C-1142-2009","Kontkanen, Jenni/0000-0002-5373-3537; Jokinen, Tuija/0000-0002-1280-1396; Kangasluoma, Juha/0000-0002-1639-1187; Junninen, Heikki/0000-0001-7178-9430; Rissanen, Matti/0000-0003-0463-8098; Mentel, Thomas/0000-0003-0810-3541; Jorgensen, Solvejg/0000-0002-0255-1338; Worsnop, Douglas/0000-0002-8928-8017; Lee, Ben/0000-0002-5057-2168; Kjaergaard, Henrik /0000-0002-7275-8297; Petaja, Tuukka/0000-0002-1881-9044; Tillmann, Ralf/0000-0003-0648-6622; Schobesberger, Siegfried/0000-0002-5777-4897; Wahner, Andreas/0000-0001-8948-1928; Kurten, Theo/0000-0002-6416-4931; Dal Maso, Miikka/0000-0003-3040-3612; Kulmala, Markku/0000-0003-3464-7825; Ehn, Mikael/0000-0002-0215-4893; Thornton, Joel/0000-0002-5098-4867","Emil Aaltonen foundation; US Department of Energy, Office of Science [DE-SC0006867]; ERC Advanced Grant EU-FP7-ATMNUCLE [227463]; EU-FP7 project PEGASOS [265148]; Academy of Finland [251427, 266388]; Academy of Finland Center of Excellence programme [1118615]","M.E. was supported by the Emil Aaltonen foundation; J.A.T. was supported by the US Department of Energy, Office of Science (DE-SC0006867).

Many volcanic eruptions, including some of the largest, result from the eruption of components stored for tens to hundreds of thousands of years before eruption(1-3). Although the physical conditions of magma storage and remobilization are of paramount importance for understanding volcanic processes, they remain relatively poorly known(4,5). Eruptions of crystal-rich magma are often suggested to require the mobilization of magma stored at near-solidus conditions(6-8); however, accumulation of significant eruptible magma volumes has also been argued to require extended storage of magma at higher temperatures(7-9). What has been lacking in this debate is clear observational evidence linking the thermal (and therefore physical) conditions within a magma reservoir to timescales of storage-that is, thermal histories. Here we present a method of constraining such thermal histories by combining timescales derived from uranium-series disequilibria, crystal sizes and trace-element zoning in crystals. At Mount Hood (Oregon, USA), only a small fraction of the total magma storage duration (at most 12 per cent and probably much less than 1 per cent) has been spent at temperatures above the critical crystallinity (40-50 per cent) at which magma is easily mobilized. Partial data sets for other volcanoes also suggest that similar conditions of magma storage are widespread and therefore that rapid mobilization of magmas stored at near-solidus temperatures is common. Magma storage at low temperatures indicates that, although thermobarometry calculations based on mineral compositions may record the conditions of crystallization, they are unlikely to reflect the conditions of most of the time that the magma is stored. Our results also suggest that largely liquid magma bodies that can be imaged geophysically will be ephemeral features and therefore their detection could indicate imminent eruption.","[Cooper, Kari M.] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Kent, Adam J.

The most ubiquitous and abundant pigment, melanin, also has a diverse range of non-visual roles, including thermoregulation in ectotherms(3,4). However, little is known about the functional evolution of this important biochrome through deep time, owing to our limited ability to unambiguously identify traces of it in the fossil record(2). Here we present direct chemical evidence of pigmentation in fossilized skin, from three distantly related marine reptiles: a leatherback turtle(5), a mosasaur(6) and an ichthyosaur(7). We demonstrate that dark traces of soft tissue in these fossils are dominated by molecularly preserved eumelanin, in intimate association with fossilized melanosomes. In addition, we suggest that contrary to the countershading of many pelagic animals(8,9), at least some ichthyosaurs were uniformly dark-coloured in life. Our analyses expand current knowledge of pigmentation in fossil integument beyond that of feathers(2,10), allowing for the reconstruction of colour over much greater ranges of extinct taxa and anatomy. In turn, our results provide evidence of convergent melanism in three disparate lineages of secondarily aquatic tetrapods. Based on extant marine analogues, we propose that the benefits of thermoregulation and/or crypsis are likely to have contributed to this melanisation, with the former having implications for the ability of each group to exploit cold environments.","[Lindgren, Johan; Gren, Johan A.] Lund Univ, Dept Geol, SE-22362 Lund, Sweden; [Sjovall, Peter] SP Tech Res Inst Sweden, SE-50115 Boras, Sweden; [Carney, Ryan M.] Brown Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Providence, RI 02906 USA; [Uvdal, Per] Lund Univ, MAX IV Lab, SE-22100 Lund, Sweden; [Uvdal, Per] Lund Univ, Dept Chem, SE-22100 Lund, Sweden; [Dyke, Gareth] Univ Southampton, Southampton SO14 3ZH, Hants, England; [Dyke, Gareth] Univ Southampton, Inst Life Sci, Southampton SO14 3ZH, Hants, England; [Schultz, Bo Pagh] Nat Hist Div, MUSERUM, DK-7800 Skive, Denmark; [Shawkey, Matthew D.] Univ Akron, Integrated Biosci Program, Akron, OH 44325 USA; [Barnes, Kenneth R.] Mosasaur Ranch Museum, Lajitas, TX 79852 USA; [Polcyn, Michael J.] So Methodist Univ, Roy M Huffington Dept Earth Sci, Dallas, TX 75275 USA","Lindgren, J (reprint author), Lund Univ, Dept Geol, SE-22362 Lund, Sweden.",johan.lindgren@geol.lu.se,,"Shawkey, Matthew/0000-0002-5131-8209; Dyke, Gareth/0000-0002-8390-7817",Swedish Research Council; Crafoord Foundation; Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences; VINNOVA Swedish Governmental Agency for Innovation Systems; National Geographic Society/Waitt Foundation; National Science Foundation; Human Frontiers Science Program; Air Force Office of Scientific Research,"We thank I.

The location and number of stalks varies among species, as exemplified by three distinct subcellular positions of stalks within a rod-shaped cell body: polar in the genus Caulobacter and subpolar or bilateral in the genus Asticcacaulis(4). Here we show that a developmental regulator of Caulobacter crescentus, SpmX(5), is co-opted in the genus Asticcacaulis to specify stalk synthesis either at the subpolar or bilateral positions. We also show that stepwise evolution of a specific region of SpmX led to the gain of a new function and localization of this protein, which drove the sequential transition in stalk positioning. Our results indicate that changes in protein function, co-option and modularity are key elements in the evolution of bacterial morphology. Therefore, similar evolutionary principles of morphological transitions apply to both single-celled prokaryotes and multicellular eukaryotes.","[Jiang, Chao; Brown, Pamela J.

Many DNA variants influence phenotypes by altering the expression level of one or several genes. The effects of such variants can be detected as expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL)(1). Traditional eQTL mapping requires large-scale genotype and gene expression data for each individual in the study sample, which limits sample sizes to hundreds of individuals in both humans and model organisms and reduces statistical power(2-6). Consequently, many eQTL are probably missed, especially those with smaller effects(7). Furthermore, most studies use messenger RNA rather than protein abundance as the measure of gene expression. Studies that have used mass-spectrometry proteomics(8-13) reported unexpected differences between eQTL and protein QTL (pQTL) for the same genes(9,10), but these studies have been even more limited in scope. Here we introduce a powerful method for identifying genetic loci that influence protein expression in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We measure single-cell protein abundance through the use of green fluorescent protein tags in very large populations of genetically variable cells, and use pooled sequencing to compare allele frequencies across the genome in thousands of individuals with high versus low protein abundance. We applied this method to 160 genes and detected many more loci per gene than previous studies. We also observed closer correspondence between loci that influence protein abundance and loci that influence mRNA abundance of a given gene. Most loci that we detected were clustered in 'hotspots' that influence multiple proteins, and some hotspots were found to influence more than half of the proteins that we examined. The variants that underlie these hotspots have profound effects on the gene regulatory network and provide insights into genetic variation in cell physiology between yeast strains.","[Albert, Frank W.; Bloom, Joshua S.; Kruglyak, Leonid] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Human Genet, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Albert, Frank W.; Treusch, Sebastian] Princeton Univ, Lewis Sigler Inst Integrat Genom, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Shockley, Arthur H.] Synthet Genom, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; [Bloom, Joshua S.; Kruglyak, Leonid] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Kruglyak, Leonid] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Biol Chem, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA","Albert, FW (reprint author), Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Human Genet, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.",falbert@mednet.ucla.edu; LKruglyak@mednet.ucla.edu,,,National Institutes of Health (NIH) [R01 GM102308]; James S.

Owing to the paucity of alimentary enzymes encoded by the human genome(2), our ability to derive energy from dietary fibre depends on the saccharification and fermentation of complex carbohydrates by the massive microbial community residing in our distal gut(3,4). The xyloglucans (XyGs) are a ubiquitous family of highly branched plant cell wall polysaccharides(5,6) whose mechanism(s) of degradation in the human gut and consequent importance in nutrition have been unclear(1,7,8). Here we demonstrate that a single, complex gene locus in Bacteroides ovatus confers XyG catabolism in this common colonic symbiont. Through targeted gene disruption, biochemical analysis of all predicted glycoside hydrolases and carbohydrate-binding proteins, and three-dimensional structural determination of the vanguard endo-xyloglucanase, we reveal the molecular mechanisms through which XyGs are hydrolysed to component monosaccharides for further metabolism. We also observe that orthologous XyG utilization loci (XyGULs) serve as genetic markers of XyG catabolism in Bacteroidetes, that XyGULs are restricted to a limited number of phylogenetically diverse strains, and that XyGULs are ubiquitous in surveyed human metagenomes. Our findings reveal that the metabolism of even highly abundant components of dietary fibre may be mediated by niche species, which has immediate fundamental and practical implications for gut symbiont population ecology in the context of human diet, nutrition and health(9-12).","[Larsbrink, Johan; McKee, Lauren S.; Spadiut, Oliver; Klinter, Stefan; Cederholm, Stefan Nilsson; Brumer, Harry] AlbaNova Univ Ctr, Royal Inst Technol KTH, Sch Biotechnol, Div Glycosci, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden; [Rogers, Theresa E.; Pudlo, Nicholas A.; Urs, Karthik; Koropatkin, Nicole M.; Kelly, Amelia G.; Martens, Eric C.] Univ Michigan, Dept Microbiol & Immunol, Sch Med, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Hemsworth, Glyn R.; Davies, Gideon J.] Univ York, Dept Chem, Struct Biol Lab, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England; [McKee, Lauren S.; Spadiut, Oliver] Royal Inst Technol KTH, Wallenberg Wood Sci Ctr, S-10044 Stockholm, Sweden; [Tauzin, Alexandra S.; Brumer, Harry] Univ British Columbia, Michael Smith Labs, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada; [Tauzin, Alexandra S.; Brumer, Harry] Univ British Columbia, Dept Chem, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada; [Creagh, A.

In the lung, resident alveolar macrophages (AMs) provide a sentinel function against inhaled pathogens(1). Bacterial constituents ligate Toll-like receptors (TLRs) on AMs(2), causing AMs to secrete proinflammatory cytokines(3) that activate alveolar epithelial receptors(4), leading to recruitment of neutrophils that engulf pathogens(5,6). Because the AM-induced response could itself cause tissue injury, it is unclear how AMs modulate the response to prevent injury. Here, using real-time alveolar imaging in situ, we show that a subset of AMs attached to the alveolar wall form connexin 43 (Cx43)-containing gap junction channels with the epithelium. During lipopolysaccharide-induced inflammation, the AMs remained sessile and attached to the alveoli, and they established intercommunication through synchronized Ca2+ waves, using the epithelium as the conducting pathway. The intercommunication was immunosuppressive, involving Ca2+-dependent activation of Akt, because AM-specific knockout of Cx43 enhanced alveolar neutrophil recruitment and secretion of proinflammatory cytokines in the bronchoalveolar lavage. A picture emerges of a novel immunomodulatory process in which a subset of alveolus-attached AMs intercommunicates immunosuppressive signals to reduce endotoxin-induced lung inflammation.","[Westphalen, Kristin; Gusarova, Galina A.; Islam, Mohammad N.; Bhattacharya, Jahar] Columbia Univ, Dept Med, Med Ctr, Lung Biol Lab,Div Pulm Allergy & Crit Care, New York, NY 10032 USA; [Subramanian, Manikandan] Columbia Univ, Med Ctr, Div Mol Med, Dept Med, New York, NY 10032 USA; [Cohen, Taylor S.; Prince, Alice S.] Columbia Univ, Med Ctr, Dept Pediat, New York, NY 10032 USA; [Bhattacharya, Jahar] Columbia Univ, Med Ctr, Coll Phys & Surg, Dept Physiol & Cellular Biophys, New York, NY 10032 USA","Bhattacharya, J (reprint author), Columbia Univ, Dept Med, Med Ctr, Lung Biol Lab,Div Pulm Allergy & Crit Care, New York, NY 10032 USA.",jb39@columbia.edu,"Cohen, Taylor/C-9927-2016","Cohen, Taylor/0000-0001-9368-0903","US National Institutes of Health [HL78645, HL57556, HL64896, HL73989]; Parker B.

Bacteria comprising the Chlamydiales were thought to be one of the few exceptions. Chlamydia harbour genes for PG biosynthesis(2-7) and exhibit susceptibility to 'anti-PG' antibiotics(8,9), yet attempts to detect PG in any chlamydial species have proven unsuccessful (the 'chlamydial anomaly'(10)). We used a novel approach to metabolically label chlamydial PG using D-amino acid dipeptide probes and click chemistry. Replicating Chlamydia trachomatis were labelled with these probes throughout their biphasic developmental life cycle, and the results of differential probe incorporation experiments conducted in the presence of ampicillin are consistent with the presence of chlamydial PG-modifying enzymes.

In differentiating embryonic stem cells, chromatin at lineage-restricted genes becomes sequentially accessible(1-4), probably by means of 'pioneer' transcription factor activity(5), but tissues may use other strategies in vivo. Lateral inhibition is a pervasive process in which one cell forces a different identity on its neighbours(6), and it is unclear how chromatin in equipotent progenitors undergoing lateral inhibition quickly enables distinct, transiently reversible cell fates. Here we report the chromatin and transcriptional underpinnings of differentiation in mouse small intestine crypts, where notch signalling mediates lateral inhibition to assign progenitor cells into absorptive or secretory lineages(7-9). Transcript profiles in isolated LGR5(+) intestinal stem cells(10) and secretory and absorptive progenitors indicated that each cell population was distinct and the progenitors specified. Nevertheless, secretory and absorptive progenitors showed comparable levels of H3K4me2 and H3K27ac histone marks and DNase I hypersensitivity-signifying accessible, permissive chromatin-at most of the same cis-elements. Enhancers acting uniquely in progenitors were well demarcated in LGR5(+) intestinal stem cells, revealing early priming of chromatin for divergent transcriptional programs, and retained active marks well after lineages were specified. On this chromatin background, ATOH1, a secretory-specific transcription factor, controls lateral inhibition through delta-like notch ligand genes and also drives the expression of numerous secretory lineage genes. Depletion of ATOH1 from specified secretory cells converted them into functional enterocytes, indicating prolonged responsiveness of marked enhancers to the presence or absence of a key transcription factor. Thus, lateral inhibition and intestinal crypt lineage plasticity involve interaction of a lineage-restricted transcription factor with broadly permissive chromatin established in multipotent stem cells.","[Kim, Tae-Hee; Li, Fugen; Ferreiro-Neira, Isabel; Ho, Li-Lun; Luyten, Annouck; Nalapareddy, Kodandaramireddy; Long, Henry; Verzi, Michael; Shivdasani, Ramesh A.] Dana Farber Canc Inst, Dept Med Oncol, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Kim, Tae-Hee; Li, Fugen; Ferreiro-Neira, Isabel; Ho, Li-Lun; Luyten, Annouck; Nalapareddy, Kodandaramireddy; Long, Henry; Verzi, Michael; Shivdasani, Ramesh A.] Dana Farber Canc Inst, Ctr Funct Canc Epigenet, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Kim, Tae-Hee; Ferreiro-Neira, Isabel; Ho, Li-Lun; Luyten, Annouck; Nalapareddy, Kodandaramireddy; Verzi, Michael; Shivdasani, Ramesh A.] Brigham & Womens Hosp, Dept Med, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Kim, Tae-Hee; Ferreiro-Neira, Isabel; Ho, Li-Lun; Luyten, Annouck; Nalapareddy, Kodandaramireddy; Verzi, Michael; Shivdasani, Ramesh A.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Boston, MA 02215 USA","Shivdasani, RA (reprint author), Dana Farber Canc Inst, Dept Med Oncol, Boston, MA 02215 USA.",ramesh_shivdasani@dfci.harvard.edu,,"Nalapareddy, Kodandaramireddy/0000-0003-3290-5114","NIH [R01DK082889, R01DK081113, K99DK095983, K01DK088868, P50CA127003]; North American Neuroendocrine Tumor Society; Caring For Carcinoid Foundation","This work was supported by NIH grants R01DK082889 and R01DK081113 (R.

Satellite cell regenerative functions decline with ageing. Here we report that geriatric satellite cells are incapable of maintaining their normal quiescent state in muscle homeostatic conditions, and that this irreversibly affects their intrinsic regenerative and self-renewal capacities. In geriatric mice, resting satellite cells lose reversible quiescence by switching to an irreversible pre-senescence state, caused by derepression of p16(INK4a) (also called Cdkn2a). On injury, these cells fail to activate and expand, undergoing accelerated entry into a full senescence state (geroconversion), even in a youthful environment. p16(INK4a) silencing in geriatric satellite cells restores quiescence and muscle regenerative functions. Our results demonstrate that maintenance of quiescence in adult life depends on the active repression of senescence pathways. As p16(INK4a) is dysregulated in human geriatric satellite cells, these findings provide the basis for stem-cell rejuvenation in sarcopenic muscles.","[Sousa-Victor, Pedro; Gutarra, Susana; Garcia-Prat, Laura; Ortet, Laura; Ruiz-Bonilla, Vanessa; Jardi, Merce; Serrano, Antonio L.; Perdiguero, Eusebio; Munoz-Canoves, Pura] Pompeu Fabra Univ, Dept Expt & Hlth Sci, Cell Biol Grp, CIBER Neurodegenerat Dis, E-08003 Barcelona, Spain; [Rodriguez-Ubreva, Javier; Ballestar, Esteban] Bellvitge Biomed Res Inst, Canc Epigenet & Biol Programme, Chromatin & Dis Grp, E-08907 Barcelona, Spain; [Gonzalez, Susana] Ctr Nacl Invest Cardiovasc, Stem Cell Aging Grp, E-28029 Madrid, Spain; [Munoz-Canoves, Pura] Inst Catalana Recerca & Estudis Avancats, E-08010 Barcelona, Spain","Munoz-Canoves, P (reprint author), Pompeu Fabra Univ, Dept Expt & Hlth Sci, Cell Biol Grp, CIBER Neurodegenerat Dis, E-08003 Barcelona, Spain.",eusebio.perdiguero@upf.edu; pura.munoz@upf.edu,"; Serrano, A /I-9198-2014; Perdiguero, Eusebio/F-3178-2013; Munoz-Canoves, Pura/B-3889-2015; Ruiz Bonilla, Vanessa/I-1026-2015; Ortet Cortada, Laura/I-1204-2015; M, Jardi/I-1201-2015; Gonzalez, Susana/I-3154-2015","Ballestar, Esteban/0000-0002-1400-2440; Serrano, A /0000-0002-1476-578X; Perdiguero, Eusebio/0000-0003-3529-8989; Munoz-Canoves, Pura/0000-0002-7533-9047; Ruiz Bonilla, Vanessa/0000-0001-6345-2264; Ortet Cortada, Laura/0000-0002-3774-1844; M, Jardi/0000-0002-2058-6606; Gonzalez, Susana/0000-0002-7443-6195","MINECO-Spain [SAF2012-38547, FIS-PS09/01267, FIS-PI13/025, PLE2009-0124]; AFM; MDA; E-Rare; Fundacio Marato TV3; DuchennePP-NL; EU; Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (Portugal); Programa de Formacion de Personal Investigador (Spain); ICREA","We are indebted to M.

Architecturally, it comprises two primary lineages, the inner luminal and outer myoepithelial cell layers. Two opposing concepts on the nature of mammary stem cells (MaSCs) in the postnatal gland have emerged. One model, based on classical transplantation assays, postulates that bipotent MaSCs have a key role in coordinating ductal epithelial expansion and maintenance in the adult gland, whereas the second model proposes that only unipotent MaSCs identified by lineage tracing contribute to these processes. Through clonal cell-fate mapping studies using a stochastic multicolour cre reporter combined with a new three-dimensional imaging strategy, we provide evidence for the existence of bipotent MaSCs as well as distinct long-lived progenitor cells. The cellular dynamics at different developmental stages support a model in which both stem and progenitor cells drive morphogenesis during puberty, whereas bipotent MaSCs coordinate ductal homeostasis and remodelling of the mouse adult gland.","[Rios, Anne C.; Fu, Nai Yang; Lindeman, Geoffrey J.; Visvader, Jane E.] Walter & Eliza Hall Inst Med Res, Stem Cells & Canc Div, Parkville, Vic 3052, Australia; [Rios, Anne C.; Fu, Nai Yang; Visvader, Jane E.] Univ Melbourne, Dept Med Biol, Parkville, Vic 3010, Australia; [Lindeman, Geoffrey J.] Univ Melbourne, Dept Med, Parkville, Vic 3010, Australia; [Lindeman, Geoffrey J.] Royal Melbourne Hosp, Dept Med Oncol, Parkville, Vic 3050, Australia; [Lindeman, Geoffrey J.] Royal Melbourne Hosp, Familial Canc Ctr, Parkville, Vic 3050, Australia","Visvader, JE (reprint author), Walter & Eliza Hall Inst Med Res, Stem Cells & Canc Div, Parkville, Vic 3052, Australia.",visvader@wehi.edu.au,,"Lindeman, Geoffrey/0000-0001-9386-2416",Australian National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC); Victorian State Government through VCA funding of the Victorian Breast Cancer Research Consortium; Victorian State Government through Operational Infrastructure Support; Australian Cancer Research Foundation; Qualtrough Family Bequest; National Breast Cancer Foundation/Cure Cancer Australia Fellowship; NHMRC Research Fellowship; Australia Fellowship,"We are grateful to F.

Here, highly purified haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), progenitor and mature cell fractions from the blood of AML patients were found to contain recurrent DNMT3A mutations (DNMT3A(mut)) at high allele frequency, but without coincident NPM1 mutations (NPM1c) present in AML blasts. DNMT3A(mut)-bearing HSCs showed a multilineage repopulation advantage over non-mutated HSCs in xenografts, establishing their identity as pre-leukaemic HSCs. Pre-leukaemic HSCs were found in remission samples, indicating that they survive chemotherapy. Therefore DNMT3A(mut) arises early in AML evolution, probably in HSCs, leading to a clonally expanded pool of pre-leukaemic HSCs from which AML evolves. Our findings provide a paradigm for the detection and treatment of pre-leukaemic clones before the acquisition of additional genetic lesions engenders greater therapeutic resistance.","[Shlush, Liran I.; Zandi, Sasan; Mitchell, Amanda; Chen, Weihsu Claire; Brandwein, Joseph M.; Gupta, Vikas; Kennedy, James A.; Schimmer, Aaron D.; Schuh, Andre C.; Yee, Karen W.; McLeod, Jessica L.; Doedens, Monica; Medeiros, Jessie J.

How early binding proteins change the ribosomal RNA structure so that later proteins may join the complex is poorly understood. Here we use single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) to observe real-time encounters between Escherichia coli ribosomal protein S4 and the 16S 5' domain RNA at an early stage of 30S assembly. Dynamic initial S4-RNA complexes pass through a stable non-native intermediate before converting to the native complex, showing that non-native structures can offer a low free-energy path to protein-RNA recognition. Three-colour FRET and molecular dynamics simulations reveal how S4 changes the frequency and direction of RNA helix motions, guiding a conformational switch that enforces the hierarchy of protein addition. These protein-guided dynamics offer an alternative explanation for induced fit in RNA-protein complexes.","[Kim, Hajin; Luthey-Schulten, Zaida; Ha, Taekjip] Univ Illinois, Ctr Phys Living Cells, Dept Phys, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Kim, Hajin; Luthey-Schulten, Zaida; Ha, Taekjip] Univ Illinois, Inst Genom Biol, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Kim, Hajin; Ha, Taekjip] Howard Hughes Med Inst, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Abeysirigunawarden, Sanjaya C.; Woodson, Sarah A.] Johns Hopkins Univ, TC Jenkins Dept Biophys, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA; [Chen, Ke; Ragunathan, Kaushik; Luthey-Schulten, Zaida; Ha, Taekjip] Univ Illinois, Ctr Biophys & Computat Biol, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Chen, Ke; Luthey-Schulten, Zaida; Ha, Taekjip] Univ Illinois, Dept Chem, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Mayerle, Megan; Woodson, Sarah A.] Johns Hopkins Univ, CMDB Program, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA","Ha, T (reprint author), Univ Illinois, Ctr Phys Living Cells, Dept Phys, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.",tjha@illinois.edu; swoodson@jhu.edu,"Ha, Taekjip/B-9506-2009","Ha, Taekjip/0000-0003-2195-6258; Woodson, Sarah/0000-0003-0170-1987; Luthey-Schulten, Zaida/0000-0001-9749-8367","National Institutes of Health [R01 GM60819, R01 GM65367]; National Science Foundation (NSF) [PHY0822613, MCB12-44570]",This work was supported by grants from the National Institutes of Health (R01 GM60819 to S.

The spatial distribution of radioactive Ti-44, synthesized in an exploding star near the boundary between material falling back onto the collapsing core and that ejected into the surrounding medium(1), directly probes the explosion asymmetries. Cassiopeia A is a young(2), nearby(3), core-collapse(4) remnant from which Ti-44 emission has previously been detected(5-8) but not imaged. Asymmetries in the explosion have been indirectly inferred from a high ratio of observed Ti-44 emission to estimated Ni-56 emission(9), from optical light echoes(10), and from jet-like features seen in the X-ray(11) and optical(12) ejecta. Here we report spatial maps and spectral properties of the Ti-44 in Cassiopeia A. This may explain the unexpected lack of correlation between the Ti-44 and iron X-ray emission, the latter being visible only in shock-heated material. The observed spatial distribution rules out symmetric explosions even with a high level of convective mixing, as well as highly asymmetric bipolar explosions resulting from a fast-rotating progenitor. Instead, these observations provide strong evidence for the development of low-mode convective instabilities in core-collapse supernovae.","[Grefenstette, B. W.; Harrison, F. A.; Madsen, K.

A key step on the way to ignition is to have the energy generated through fusion reactions in an inertially confined fusion plasma exceed the amount of energy deposited into the deuterium-tritium fusion fuel and hotspot during the implosion process, resulting in a fuel gain greater than unity. Here we report the achievement of fusion fuel gains exceeding unity on the US National Ignition Facility using a 'high-foot' implosion method(2,3), which is a manipulation of the laser pulse shape in a way that reduces instability in the implosion. These experiments show an order-of-magnitude improvement in yield performance over past deuterium-tritium implosion experiments. We also see a significant contribution to the yield from alpha-particle self-heating and evidence for the 'bootstrapping' required to accelerate the deuterium-tritium fusion burn to eventually 'run away' and ignite.","[Hurricane, O.

However, in typical nanoribbons produced from lithographically patterned exfoliated graphene, the charge carriers travel only about ten nanometres between scattering events, resulting in minimum sheet resistances of about one kilohm per square(2-5). Here we show that 40-nanometre-wide graphene nanoribbons epitaxially grown on silicon carbide(6,7) are single-channel room-temperature ballistic conductors on a length scale greater than ten micrometres, which is similar to the performance of metallic carbon nanotubes. This is equivalent to sheet resistances below 1 ohm per square, surpassing theoretical predictions for perfect graphene(8) by at least an order of magnitude. In neutral graphene ribbons, we show that transport is dominated by two modes. One is ballistic and temperature independent; the other is thermally activated. Transport is protected from back-scattering, possibly reflecting ground-state properties of neutral graphene. At room temperature, the resistance of both modes is found to increase abruptly at a particular length-the ballistic mode at 16 micrometres and the other at 160 nanometres. Our epitaxial graphene nanoribbons will be important not only in fundamental science, but also-because they can be readily produced in thousands-in advanced nanoelectronics, which can make use of their room-temperature ballistic transport properties.","[Baringhaus, Jens; Edler, Frederik; Tegenkamp, Christoph] Leibniz Univ Hannover, Inst Festkorperphys, D-30167 Hannover, Germany; [Ruan, Ming; Jiang, Zhigang; Conrad, Edward H.; Berger, Claire; de Heer, Walt A.] Georgia Inst Technol, Sch Phys, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA; [Tejeda, Antonio; Sicot, Muriel] Univ Lorraine, UMR CNRS 7198, Inst Jean Lamour, F-54506 Vandoeuvre Les Nancy, France; [Tejeda, Antonio; Taleb-Ibrahimi, Amina] UR1 CNRS Synchrotron SOLEIL, F-91192 Gif Sur Yvette, France; [Li, An-Ping] Oak Ridge Natl Lab, Ctr Nanophase Mat Sci, Oak Ridge, TN 37831 USA; [Berger, Claire] CNRS UJF INP, Inst Neel, F-38042 Grenoble 6, France","de Heer, WA (reprint author), Georgia Inst Technol, Sch Phys, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA.",walt.deheer@physics.gatech.edu,"Li, An-Ping/B-3191-2012; Tejeda, Antonio/C-4711-2014; Tegenkamp, Christoph/I-1639-2013","Li, An-Ping/0000-0003-4400-7493; Tejeda, Antonio/0000-0003-0125-4603; Tegenkamp, Christoph/0000-0003-0453-0765","German Research Foundation [1459]; AFOSR; NSF [MRSEC - DMR 0820382]; W.

The hydrothermal system at Yellowstone National Park is famous for its high helium-3/helium-4 isotope ratio, commonly cited as evidence for a deep mantle source for the Yellowstone hotspot(2). However, much of the helium emitted from this region is actually radiogenic helium-4 produced within the crust by alpha-decay of uranium and thorium. Here we show, by combining gas emission rates with chemistry and isotopic analyses, that crustal helium-4 emission rates from Yellowstone exceed (by orders of magnitude) any conceivable rate of generation within the crust. It seems that helium has accumulated for (at least) many hundreds of millions of years in Archaean (more than 2.5 billion years old) cratonic rocks beneath Yellowstone, only to be liberated over the past two million years by intense crustal metamorphism induced by the Yellowstone hotspot. Our results demonstrate the extremes in variability of crustal helium efflux on geologic time-scales and imply crustal-scale open-system behaviour of helium in tectonically and magmatically active regions.","[Lowenstern, J.

However, an alternative view is that lineages typically interact when relatively old(6), by which time selection for divergence is weak(7,8) and potentially exceeded by convergent selection acting on traits mediating interspecific competition(9). Few studies have tested these contrasting predictions across large radiations, or by controlling for evolutionary time. Thus the role of species interactions in driving broad-scale patterns of trait divergence is unclear(10). Here we use phylogenetic estimates of divergence times to show that increased trait differences among coexisting lineages of ovenbirds (Furnariidae) are explained by their greater evolutionary age in relation to non-interacting lineages, and that-when these temporal biases are accounted for-the only significant effect of coexistence is convergence in a social signal (song). Our results conflict with the conventional view that coexistence promotes trait divergence among co-occurring organisms at macroevolutionary scales, and instead provide evidence that species interactions can drive phenotypic convergence across entire radiations, a pattern generally concealed by biases in age.","[Tobias, Joseph A.; Cornwallis, Charlie K.; Seddon, Nathalie] Univ Oxford, Dept Zool, Edward Grey Inst, Oxford OX1 3PS, England; [Cornwallis, Charlie K.] Lund Univ, Dept Biol, SE-22362 Lund, Sweden; [Derryberry, Elizabeth P.; Claramunt, Santiago; Brumfield, Robb T.] Louisiana State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA; [Derryberry, Elizabeth P.] Tulane Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, New Orleans, LA 70118 USA; [Claramunt, Santiago; Brumfield, Robb T.] Louisiana State Univ, Museum Nat Sci, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA; [Claramunt, Santiago] Amer Museum Nat Hist, Dept Ornithol, New York, NY 10024 USA","Tobias, JA (reprint author), Univ Oxford, Dept Zool, Edward Grey Inst, S Parks Rd, Oxford OX1 3PS, England.",joseph.tobias@zoo.ox.ac.uk,"Brumfield, Robb/K-6108-2015","Brumfield, Robb/0000-0003-2307-0688; Tobias, Joseph/0000-0003-2429-6179","John Fell Fund; Browne Fellowship, Queen's College, Oxford; Vetenskapsradet; National Science Foundation; Royal Society","We thank G.

Honeybees (Apis mellifera), the prevailing managed insect crop pollinator, suffer from a range of emerging and exotic high-impact pathogens(3,4), and population maintenance requires active management by beekeepers to control them. Wild pollinators such as bumblebees (Bombus spp.) are in global decline(5,6), one cause of which may be pathogen spillover from managed pollinators like honeybees(7,8) or commercial colonies of bumblebees(9). Here we use a combination of infection experiments and landscape-scale field data to show that honeybee EIDs are indeed widespread infectious agents within the pollinator assemblage. The prevalence of deformed wing virus (DWV) and the exotic parasite Nosema ceranae in honeybees and bumblebees is linked; as honeybees have higher DWV prevalence, and sympatric bumblebees and honeybees are infected by the same DWV strains, Apis is the likely source of at least one major EID in wild pollinators. Lessons learned from vertebrates(10,11) highlight the need for increased pathogen control in managed bee species to maintain wild pollinators, as declines in native pollinators may be caused by interspecies pathogen transmission originating from managed pollinators.","[Fuerst, M.

However, the discovery of similar flow patterns in the lungs of crocodilians indicates that this character is probably ancestral for all archosaurs-the group that includes extant birds and crocodilians as well as their extinct relatives, such as pterosaurs and dinosaurs(4-6). Unidirectional flow in birds results from aerodynamic valves, rather than from sphincters or other physical mechanisms(7,8), and similar aerodynamic valves seem to be present in crocodilians(4-6). The anatomical and developmental similarities in the primary and secondary bronchi of birds and crocodilians suggest that these structures and airflow patterns may be homologous(4-6,9). The origin of this pattern is at least as old as the split between crocodilians and birds, which occurred in the Triassic period(10). Alternatively, this pattern of flow may be even older; this hypothesis can be tested by investigating patterns of airflow in members of the outgroup to birds and crocodilians, the Lepidosauromorpha (tuatara, lizards and snakes). Here we demonstrate region-specific unidirectional airflow in the lungs of the savannah monitor lizard (Varanus exanthematicus). The presence of unidirectional flow in the lungs of V. exanthematicus thus gives rise to two possible evolutionary scenarios: either unidirectional airflow evolved independently in archosaurs and monitor lizards, or these flow patterns are homologous in archosaurs and V. exanthematicus, having evolved only once in ancestral diapsids (the clade encompassing snakes, lizards, crocodilians and birds). If unidirectional airflow is plesiomorphic for Diapsida, this respiratory character can be reconstructed for extinct diapsids, and evolved in a small ectothermic tetrapod during the Palaeozoic era at least a hundred million years before the origin of birds.","[Schachner, Emma R.; Cieri, Robert L.; Farmer, C.

The aetiological role of infection with high-risk human papilloma viruses (HPVs) in cervical carcinomas is well established(3). Previous studies have also implicated somatic mutations in PIK3CA, PTEN, TP53, STK11 and KRAS(4-7) as well as several copy-number alterations in the pathogenesis of cervical carcinomas(8,9). Here we report whole-exome sequencing analysis of 115 cervical carcinoma-normal paired samples, transcriptome sequencing of 79 cases and whole-genome sequencing of 14 tumour-normal pairs. Previously unknown somatic mutations in 79 primary squamous cell carcinomas include recurrent E322K substitutions in the MAPK1 gene (8%), inactivating mutations in the HLA-B gene (9%), and mutations in EP300 (16%), FBXW7 (15%), NFE2L2 (4%), TP53 (5%) and ERBB2 (6%). We also observe somatic ELF3 (13%) and CBFB (8%) mutations in 24 adenocarcinomas. Squamous cell carcinomas have higher frequencies of somatic nucleotide substitutions occurring at cytosines preceded by thymines (Tp*C sites) than adenocarcinomas. Gene expression levels at HPV integration sites were statistically significantly higher in tumours with HPV integration compared with expression of the same genes in tumours without viral integration at the same site. These data demonstrate several recurrent genomic alterations in cervical carcinomas that suggest new strategies to combat this disease.","[Ojesina, Akinyemi I.; Pedamallu, Chandra Sekhar; Pugh, Trevor J.; Wright, Alexi A.; Duke, Fujiko; Kaplan, Bethany; Wang, Rui; Greulich, Heidi; Meyerson, Matthew] Dana Farber Canc Inst, Dept Med Oncol, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Ojesina, Akinyemi I.; Lichtenstein, Lee; Freeman, Samuel S.; Pedamallu, Chandra Sekhar; Pugh, Trevor J.; Cherniack, Andrew D.; Ambrogio, Lauren; Cibulskis, Kristian; Rosenberg, Mara W.; Kaplan, Bethany; Nickerson, Elizabeth; Lawrence, Michael S.; Stewart, Chip; Carter, Scott L.; McKenna, Aaron; Cortes, Maria L.; Greulich, Heidi; Gabriel, Stacey B.; Getz, Gad; Meyerson, Matthew] Eli & Edythe L Broad Inst Massachusetts Inst Tech, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; [Imaz-Rosshandler, Ivan; Romero-Cordoba, Sandra; Vazquez-Santillan, Karla; Salido Guadarrama, Alberto; Espinosa-Castilla, Magali; Belem Gabino, Nayeli; Hidalgo-Miranda, Alfredo; Escareno, Claudia Rangel; Melendez-Zajgla, Jorge] Inst Nacl Med Genom, Mexico City 14610, DF, Mexico; [Bertelsen, Bjorn; Akslen, Lars A.; Vintermyr, Olav K.] Haukeland Hosp, Dept Pathol, N-5021 Bergen, Norway; [Trevino, Victor] Tecnol Monterrey, Monterrey 64849, Mexico; [Wright, Alexi A.; Greulich, Heidi] Brigham & Womens Hosp, Dept Med, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Wang, Rui] Fudan Univ, Shanghai Canc Ctr, Dept Thorac Surg, Shanghai 200032, Peoples R China; [Walline, Heather M.] Univ Michigan, Rackham Grad Sch, Program Biomed Sci, Canc Biol Program, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Rodriguez-Sanchez, Iram P.; Sofia Gomez-Macias, Gabriela; Valdez-Chapa, Lezmes D.; Lourdes Garza-Rodriguez, Maria; Barrera-Saldana, Hugo A.] Univ Autonoma Nuevo Leon, Fac Med, Monterrey 64460, Nuevo Leon, Mexico; [Rodriguez-Sanchez, Iram P.; Sofia Gomez-Macias, Gabriela; Valdez-Chapa, Lezmes D.; Lourdes Garza-Rodriguez, Maria; Barrera-Saldana, Hugo A.] Univ Autonoma Nuevo Leon, Hosp Univ Dr Jose Eluterio Gonzalez, Monterrey 64460, Nuevo Leon, Mexico; [Woie, Kathrine; Bjorge, Line; Wik, Elisabeth; Halle, Mari K.; Hoivik, Erling A.; Krakstad, Camilla; Salvesen, Helga B.] Haukeland Hosp, Dept Obstet & Gynecol, N-5021 Bergen, Norway; [Bjorge, Line; Wik, Elisabeth; Halle, Mari K.; Hoivik, Erling A.; Krakstad, Camilla; Salvesen, Helga B.] Univ Bergen, Ctr Canc Biomarkers, Dept Clin Sci, N-5020 Bergen, Norway; [Maytorena, German; Vazquez, Jorge; Rodea, Carlos; Cravioto, Adrian] Inst Mexicano Seguro Social, Mexico City 06720, DF, Mexico; [Crum, Christopher P.; Meyerson, Matthew] Brigham & Womens Hosp, Dept Pathol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Neuberg, Donna S.] Dana Farber Canc Inst, Dept Biostat & Computat Biol, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Escareno, Claudia Rangel] Claremont Grad Univ, Claremont, CA 91711 USA; [Akslen, Lars A.; Vintermyr, Olav K.] Univ Bergen, Dept Clin Med, Ctr Canc Biomarkers, N-5020 Bergen, Norway; [Carey, Thomas E.] Univ Michigan, Ctr Comprehens Canc, Head & Neck Oncol Program, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Carey, Thomas E.] Univ Michigan, Ctr Comprehens Canc, Dept Otolaryngol, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Getz, Gad] Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Ctr Canc, Boston, MA 02114 USA; [Getz, Gad] Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Dept Pathol, Boston, MA 02114 USA; [Getz, Gad] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Boston, MA 02114 USA","Meyerson, M (reprint author), Dana Farber Canc Inst, Dept Med Oncol, Boston, MA 02215 USA.",helga.salvesen@uib.no; matthew_meyerson@dfci.harvard.edu,"; Hidalgo-Miranda, Alfredo/B-2123-2010; Trevino, Victor/C-9219-2009; Romero-Cordoba, Sandra Lorena/A-2246-2014; Akslen, Lars /C-1202-2017; Bjorge, Line/C-1307-2017; salvesen, Helga/C-1187-2017","Carey, Thomas/0000-0002-5202-7518; Freeman, Samuel/0000-0001-8285-0057; Meyerson, Matthew/0000-0002-9133-8108; Hidalgo-Miranda, Alfredo/0000-0003-2315-3977; Trevino, Victor/0000-0002-7472-9844; Romero-Cordoba, Sandra Lorena/0000-0002-5591-696X; Akslen, Lars /0000-0003-2710-9543; Bjorge, Line/0000-0002-0240-2770; salvesen, Helga/0000-0002-4438-8831; Ojesina, Akinyemi/0000-0003-0755-3639; Halle, Mari/0000-0002-2660-8271; Krakstad, Camilla/0000-0002-0174-8139","Carlos Slim Health Institute in Mexico; Rebecca Ridley Kry Fellowship of the Damon Runyon Cancer Research Foundation; MMRF Research Fellow Award; Helse Vest; Research Council of Norway; Norwegian Cancer Society; Harald Andersens legat; CONACyT [SALUD-2008-C01-87625, 161619]; UANL PAICyT [CS1038-1]; Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social (IMSS)","This work was conducted as part of the Slim Initiative for Genomic Medicine in the Americas, a project funded by the Carlos Slim Health Institute in Mexico.

Here we performed a genome-wide association study meta-analysis in a total of >100,000 subjects of European and Asian ancestries (29,880 RA cases and 73,758 controls), by evaluating similar to 10 million single-nucleotide polymorphisms. We discovered 42 novel RA risk loci at a genome-wide level of significance, bringing the total to 101 (refs 2-4). We devised an in silico pipeline using established bioinformatics methods based on functional annotation(5), cis-acting expression quantitative trait loci(6) and pathway analyses(7-9)-as well as novel methods based on genetic overlap with human primary immunodeficiency, haematological cancer somatic mutations and knockout mouse phenotypes-to identify 98 biological candidate genes at these 101 risk loci. We demonstrate that these genes are the targets of approved therapies for RA, and further suggest that drugs approved for other indications may be repurposed for the treatment of RA. Together, this comprehensive genetic study sheds light on fundamental genes, pathways and cell types that contribute to RA pathogenesis, and provides empirical evidence that the genetics of RA can provide important information for drug discovery.","[Okada, Yukinori; Wu, Di; Trynka, Gosia; Diogo, Dorothee; Cui, Jing; Liao, Katherine; Guo, Michael H.; Karlson, Elizabeth W.; Raychaudhuri, Soumya; Plenge, Robert M.] Harvard Univ, Brigham & Womens Hosp, Sch Med, Div Rheumatol Immunol & Allergy, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Okada, Yukinori; Wu, Di; Trynka, Gosia; Raj, Towfique; Diogo, Dorothee; Cui, Jing; Liao, Katherine; Raychaudhuri, Soumya; De Jager, Philip L.; Plenge, Robert M.] Harvard Univ, Brigham & Womens Hosp, Sch Med, Div Genet, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Okada, Yukinori; Wu, Di; Trynka, Gosia; Raj, Towfique; Esko, Tonu; Gupta, Namrata; Mirel, Daniel; Diogo, Dorothee; Cui, Jing; Liao, Katherine; Guo, Michael H.; Raychaudhuri, Soumya; De Jager, Philip L.; Plenge, Robert M.] Broad Inst, Program Med & Populat Genet, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; [Wu, Di; Liu, Jun S.] Harvard Univ, Dept Stat, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Wu, Di] Monash Univ, Monash Inst Med Res, Ctr Canc Res, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia; [Raj, Towfique; De Jager, Philip L.] Brigham & Womens Hosp, Dept Neurol, Inst Neurosci, Programin Translat NeuroPsychiat Genom, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Terao, Chikashi; Kawaguchi, Takahisa; Matsuda, Fumihiko] Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Med, Ctr Genom Med, Kyoto 6068507, Japan; [Terao, Chikashi; Ohmura, Koichiro; Mimori, Tsuneyo] Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Med, Dept Rheumatol & Clin immunol, Kyoto 6068507, Japan; [Ikari, Katsunori; Yoshida, Shinji; Taniguchi, Atsuo; Yamanaka, Hisashi; Momohara, Shigeki] Tokyo Womens Med Univ, Inst Rheumatol, Tokyo 1620054, Japan; [Kochi, Yuta; Suzuki, Akari; Myouzen, Keiko; Yamamoto, Kazuhiko] RIKEN, Ctr Integrat Med Sci, Lab Autoimmune Dis, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2300045, Japan; [Graham, Robert R.; Manoharan, Arun; Ortmann, Ward; Bhangale, Tushar; Behrens, Timothy W.] Genentech Inc, Immunol Biomarkers Grp, San Francisco, CA 94080 USA; [Denny, Joshua C.; Carroll, Robert J.] Vanderbilt Univ, Sch Med, Dept Biomed Informat, Nashville, TN 37232 USA; [Denny, Joshua C.; Eyler, Anne E.] Vanderbilt Univ, Sch Med, Dept Med, Nashville, TN 37232 USA; [Greenberg, Jeffrey D.] NYU, Hosp Joint Dis, New York, NY 10003 USA; [Kremer, Joel M.] Albany Med Ctr, Dept Med, Albany, NY 12206 USA; [Kremer, Joel M.] Ctr Rheumatol, Albany, NY 12206 USA; [Pappas, Dimitrios A.] Columbia Univ, Coll Phys & Surg, Presbyterian Hosp, Div Rheumatol,Dept Med, New York, NY 10032 USA; [Jiang, Lei; Yin, Jian; Ye, Lingying; Xu, Huji] Second Mil Med Univ, Shanghai Changzheng Hosp, Dept Rheumatol & Immunol, Shanghai 200003, Peoples R China; [Su, Ding-Feng] Second Mil Med Univ, Dept Pharmacol, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China; [Yang, Jian; Visscher, Peter M.; Brown, Matthew A.] Univ Queensland, Diamantina Inst, Translat Res Inst, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia; [Yang, Jian; Visscher, Peter M.] Univ Queensland, Queensland Brain Inst, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia; [Xie, Gang; Siminovitch, Katherine A.] Mt Sinai Hosp, Lunenfeld Tanenbaum Res Inst, Toronto, ON M5G 1X5, Canada; [Xie, Gang; Siminovitch, Katherine A.] Toronto Gen Res Inst, Toronto, ON M5G 2M9, Canada; [Xie, Gang; Siminovitch, Katherine A.] Univ Toronto, Dept Med, Toronto, ON M5S 2J7, Canada; [Keystone, Ed] Mt Sinai Hosp, Dept Med, Toronto, ON M5S 2J7, Canada; [Keystone, Ed] Univ Toronto, Toronto, ON M5S 2J7, Canada; [Westra, Harm-Jan; Zhernakova, Alexandra; Franke, Lude] Univ Groningen, Univ Med Ctr Groningen, Dept Genet, NL-9700 RB Groningen, Netherlands; [Esko, Tonu; Metspalu, Andres] Univ Tartu, Estonian Genome Ctr, EE-51010 Tartu, Estonia; [Esko, Tonu; Guo, Michael H.] Childrens Hosp, Div Endocrinol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Zhou, Xuezhong] Beijing Jiaotong Univ, Sch Comp & Informat Technol, Beijing 100044, Peoples R China; [Stahl, Eli A.] Mt Sinai Sch Med, Dept Psychiat, New York, NY 10029 USA; [Coenen, Marieke J.

The therapeutic transgene cassette can be packaged in different AAV capsid pseudotypes, each having a unique transduction profile. At present, rAAV capsid serotype selection for a specific clinical trial is based on effectiveness in animal models. However, preclinical animal studies are not always predictive of human outcome(4-8). Here, in an attempt to further our understanding of these discrepancies, we used a chimaeric human-murine liver model to compare directly the relative efficiency of rAAV transduction in human versus mouse hepatocytes in vivo. As predicted from preclinical and clinical studies(4,5,8), rAAV2 vectors functionally transduced mouse and human hepatocytes at equivalent but relatively low levels. However, rAAV8 vectors, which are very effective in many animal models, transduced human hepatocytes rather poorly-approximately 20 times less efficiently than mouse hepatocytes. In light of the limitations of the rAAV vectors currently used in clinical studies, we used the same murine chimaeric liver model to perform serial selection using a human-specific replication-competent viral library composed of DNA-shuffled AAV capsids. One chimaeric capsid composed of five different parental AAV capsids was found to transduce human primary hepatocytes at high efficiency in vitro and in vivo, and provided species-selected transduction in primary liver, cultured cells and a hepatocellular carcinoma xenograft model. This vector is an ideal clinical candidate and a reagent for gene modification of human xenotransplants in mouse models of human diseases. More importantly, our results suggest that humanized murine models may represent a more precise approach for both selecting and evaluating clinically relevant rAAV serotypes for gene therapeutic applications.","[Lisowski, Leszek; Chu, Kirk; Zhang, Yue; Kay, Mark A.] Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Dept Pediat, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Lisowski, Leszek; Chu, Kirk; Zhang, Yue; Kay, Mark A.] Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Dept Genet, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Dane, Allison P.; Cunningham, Sharon C.; Alexander, Ian E.] Childrens Hosp Westmead, Gene Therapy Res Unit, Westmead, NSW 2145, Australia; [Dane, Allison P.; Cunningham, Sharon C.; Alexander, Ian E.] Childrens Med Res Inst, Westmead, NSW 2145, Australia; [Wilson, Elizabeth M.] Yecuris Corp, Portland, OR 97062 USA; [Nygaard, Sean; Grompe, Markus] Oregon Hlth & Sci Univ, Oregon Stem Cell Ctr, Portland, OR 97239 USA; [Alexander, Ian E.] Univ Sydney, Discipline Paediat & Child Hlth, Sydney, NSW 2145, Australia","Kay, MA (reprint author), Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Dept Pediat, 269 Campus Dr, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",markay@stanford.edu,,,"National Institutes of Health [HL092096, HL064274, DK048252]; Berry Fellowship Foundation; Australian National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) [1008021]",This work was supported by National Institutes of Health grants HL092096 and HL064274 to M.

This process has been extensively studied in the unicellular yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which exhibits separate regulatory control over mating and meiosis. Here we address the mechanism of sexual reproduction in the related hemiascomycete species Candida lusitaniae. We demonstrate that, in contrast to S. cerevisiae, C. lusitaniae exhibits a highly integrated sexual program in which the programs regulating mating and meiosis have fused. Profiling of the C. lusitaniae sexual cycle revealed that gene expression patterns during mating and meiosis were overlapping, indicative of co-regulation. This was particularly evident for genes involved in pheromone MAPK signalling, which were highly induced throughout the sexual cycle of C. lusitaniae. Furthermore, genetic analysis showed that the orthologue of IME2, a 'diploid-specific' factor in S. cerevisiae(1,2), and STE12, the master regulator of S. cerevisiae mating(3,4), were each required for progression through both mating and meiosis in C. lusitaniae. Together, our results establish that sexual reproduction has undergone significant rewiring between S. cerevisiae and C. lusitaniae, and that a concerted sexual cycle operates in C. lusitaniae that is more reminiscent of the distantly related ascomycete, Schizosaccharomyces pombe. We discuss these results in light of the evolution of sexual reproduction in yeast, and propose that regulatory coupling of mating and meiosis has evolved multiple times as an adaptation to promote the haploid lifestyle.","[Sherwood, Racquel Kim; Scaduto, Christine M.; Torres, Sandra E.; Bennett, Richard J.] Brown Univ, Dept Microbiol & Immunol, Providence, RI 02912 USA","Bennett, RJ (reprint author), Brown Univ, Dept Microbiol & Immunol, 171 Meeting St, Providence, RI 02912 USA.",Richard_Bennett@brown.edu,,"Bennett, Richard/0000-0001-7563-484X",National Science Foundation [MCB1021120]; National Institutes of Health [AI081704]; Burroughs Wellcome Fund;  [T32GM007601];  [F31AI075607],"We thank J.

The ten-eleven translocation (Tet) dioxygenases convert 5mC to 5hmC, 5fC and 5caC in three consecutive, Fe(II)- and alpha-ketoglutarate-dependent oxidation reactions(1-4). The Tet family of dioxygenases is widely distributed across the tree of life(5), including in the heterolobosean amoeboflagellate Naegleria gruberi. The genome of Naegleria(6) encodes homologues of mammalian DNA methyltransferase and Tet proteins(7). Here we study biochemically and structurally one of the Naegleria Tet-like proteins (NgTet1), which shares significant sequence conservation (approximately 14% identity or 39% similarity) with mammalian Tet1. Like mammalian Tet proteins, NgTet1 acts on 5mC and generates 5hmC, 5fC and 5caC. The crystal structure of NgTet1 in complex with DNA containing a 5mCpG site revealed that NgTet1 uses a base-flipping mechanism to access 5mC. The DNA is contacted from the minor groove and bent towards the major groove. The flipped 5mC is positioned in the active-site pocket with planar stacking contacts, Watson-Crick polar hydrogen bonds and van der Waals interactions specific for 5mC. The sequence conservation between NgTet1 and mammalian Tet1, including residues involved in structural integrity and functional significance, suggests structural conservation across phyla.","[Hashimoto, Hideharu; Zhang, Xing; Cheng, Xiaodong] Emory Univ, Sch Med, Dept Biochem, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA; [Pais, June E.; Saleh, Lana; Dai, Nan; Correa, Ivan R., Jr.; Zheng, Yu] New England Biolabs Inc, Ipswich, MA 01938 USA; [Fu, Zheng-Qing] Univ Georgia, Dept Biochem & Mol Biol, Athens, GA 30602 USA; [Fu, Zheng-Qing] Argonne Natl Lab, Adv Photon Source, Sect 22, Argonne, IL 60439 USA","Cheng, XD (reprint author), Emory Univ, Sch Med, Dept Biochem, 1510 Clifton Rd, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA.",zhengy@neb.com; xcheng@emory.edu,"Dai, Nan/I-5950-2013; Hashimoto, Hideharu/C-2079-2012","Hashimoto, Hideharu/0000-0002-5674-5779","National Institutes of Health [GM049245, GM095209, GM105132]","We thank R.

However, new (de novo) mutations, in the form of large chromosomal copy number changes, occur in a small fraction of cases and disproportionally disrupt genes encoding postsynaptic proteins. Here we show that small de novo mutations, affecting one ora few nucleotides, are overrepresented among glutamatergic postsynaptic proteins comprising activity-regulated cytoskeleton-associated protein (ARC) and N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) complexes. Mutations are additionally enriched in proteins that interact with these complexes to modulate synaptic strength, namely proteins regulating actin filament dynamics and those whose messenger RNAs are targets of fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP). Genes affected by mutations in schizophrenia overlap those mutated in autism and intellectual disability, as do mutation-enriched synaptic pathways. Aligning our findings with a parallel case-control study, we demonstrate reproducible insights into aetiological mechanisms for schizophrenia and reveal pathophysiology shared with other neurodevelopmental disorders.","[Fromer, Menachem; Ruderfer, Douglas M.; Johnson, Jessica S.; Roussos, Panos; Mahajan, Milind; Sklar, Pamela; Purcell, Shaun M.] Icahn Sch Med Mt Sinai, Dept Psychiat, Div Psychiat Genom, New York, NY 10029 USA; [Fromer, Menachem; Ruderfer, Douglas M.; Johnson, Jessica S.; Roussos, Panos; Mahajan, Milind; Sklar, Pamela; Purcell, Shaun M.] Icahn Sch Med Mt Sinai, Inst Genom & Multiscale Biol, New York, NY 10029 USA; [Fromer, Menachem; Barker, Douglas D.; Rose, Samuel A.; Chambert, Kimberly; Scolnick, Edward M.; Moran, Jennifer L.; McCarroll, Steven A.; Purcell, Shaun M.] Broad Inst MIT & Harvard, Stanley Ctr Psychiat Res, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; [Pocklington, Andrew J.; Kavanagh, David H.; Williams, Hywel J.; Dwyer, Sarah; Georgieva, Lyudmila; Rees, Elliott; Ruderfer, Douglas M.; Carrera, Noa; Humphreys, Isla; Hannon, Eilis; Kirov, George; Holmans, Peter; Owen, Michael J.; O'Donovan, Michael C.] Cardiff Univ, Inst Psychol Med & Clin Neurosci, Med Res Council Ctr Neuropsychiat Genet & Genom, Cardiff CF24 4HQ, S Glam, Wales; [Gormley, Padhraig; Palta, Priit; Palotie, Aarno] Wellcome Trust Sanger Inst, Hinxton CB10 1SA, England; [Gormley, Padhraig; Banks, Eric; Palotie, Aarno; McCarroll, Steven A.] Broad Inst MIT & Harvard, Program Med & Populat Genet, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; [Palta, Priit] Univ Tartu, Inst Mol & Cell Biol, Dept Bioinformat, EE-51010 Tartu, Estonia; [Palta, Priit; Palotie, Aarno] Univ Helsinki, Inst Mol Med Finland FIMM, FIN-00290 Helsinki, Finland; [Milanova, Vihra] Med Univ, Dept Psychiat, Sofia 1431, Bulgaria; [Grant, Seth G.] Univ Edinburgh, Ctr Neuroregenerat, Edinburgh EH16 4SB, Midlothian, Scotland; [McCarroll, Steven A.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Genet, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Sklar, Pamela] Icahn Sch Med Mt Sinai, Friedman Brain Inst, New York, NY 10029 USA; [Purcell, Shaun M.] Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Analyt & Translat Genet Unit, Psychiat & Neurodev Genet Unit, Boston, MA 02114 USA","Owen, MJ (reprint author), Cardiff Univ, Inst Psychol Med & Clin Neurosci, Med Res Council Ctr Neuropsychiat Genet & Genom, Cardiff CF24 4HQ, S Glam, Wales.",owenmj@cardiff.ac.uk,"; Holmans, Peter/F-4518-2015; Ruderfer, Douglas/M-5795-2016; Roussos, Panos/J-7090-2013","Gormley, Padhraig/0000-0002-8908-6968; Holmans, Peter/0000-0003-0870-9412; Ruderfer, Douglas/0000-0002-2365-386X; Roussos, Panos/0000-0002-4640-6239; McCarroll, Steven/0000-0002-6954-8184; Moran, Jennifer/0000-0002-5664-4716; Hannon, Eilis/0000-0001-6840-072X; O'Donovan, Michael/0000-0001-7073-2379; Kirov, George/0000-0002-3427-3950; Palta, Priit/0000-0001-9320-7008","Medical Research Council (MRC) Centre [G0800509, G0801418]; European Community [HEALTH-F2-2010-241909]; NIMH [2 P50 MH066392-05A1]; Friedman Brain Institute; Institute for Genomics and Multiscale Biology; National Institutes of Health [R01HG005827, R01MH099126, R01MH071681]; Fidelity Foundations; Sylvan Herman Foundation; Stanley Medical Research Institute; Wellcome Trust [WT089062, WT098051]; European Commission [261123]","Work in Cardiff was supported by Medical Research Council (MRC) Centre (G0800509) and Program Grants (G0801418), the European Community's Seventh Framework Programme (HEALTH-F2-2010-241909 (Project EU-GEI)), and NIMH (2 P50 MH066392-05A1).

Here, by analysing the exome sequences of 2,536 schizophrenia cases and 2,543 controls, we demonstrate a polygenic burden primarily arising from rare (less than 1 in 10,000), disruptive mutations distributed across many genes. Particularly enriched gene sets include the voltage-gated calcium ion channel and the signalling complex formed by the activity-regulated cytoskeleton-associated scaffold protein (ARC) of the postsynaptic density, sets previously implicated by genome-wide association and copy-number variation studies. Similar to reports in autism, targets of the fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP, product of FMR1) are enriched for case mutations. No individual gene-based test achieves significance after correction for multiple testing and we do not detect any alleles of moderately low frequency (approximately 0.5 to 1 per cent) and moderately large effect. Taken together, these data suggest that population-based exome sequencing can discover risk alleles and complements established gene-mapping paradigms in neuropsychiatric disease.","[Purcell, Shaun M.; Moran, Jennifer L.; Fromer, Menachem; O'Dushlaine, Colm; Chambert, Kimberly; Bergen, Sarah E.; Duncan, Laramie; Genovese, Giulio; Haggarty, Stephen J.; Scolnick, Edward M.; McCarroll, Steven A.] Broad Inst MIT & Harvard, Stanley Ctr Psychiat Res, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; [Purcell, Shaun M.; Fromer, Menachem; Ruderfer, Douglas; Roussos, Panos; Stahl, Eli; Sklar, Pamela] Icahn Sch Med Mt Sinai, Div Psychiat Genom, Dept Psychiat, New York, NY 10029 USA; [Purcell, Shaun M.; Fromer, Menachem; Ruderfer, Douglas; Roussos, Panos; Stahl, Eli; Sklar, Pamela] Icahn Sch Med Mt Sinai, Inst Genom & Multiscale Biol, New York, NY 10029 USA; [Purcell, Shaun M.; Fromer, Menachem; Solovieff, Nadia; Duncan, Laramie; Haggarty, Stephen J.] Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Analyt & Translat Genet Unit, Psychiat & Neurodev Genet Unit, Boston, MA 02114 USA; [Purcell, Shaun M.; Duncan, Laramie; Banks, Eric; Shakir, Khalid; Garimella, Kiran; Fennell, Tim; DePristo, Mark; Gabriel, Stacey; Lander, Eric S.; McCarroll, Steven A.] Broad Inst MIT & Harvard, Med & Populat Genet Program, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; [Bergen, Sarah E.; Kahler, Anna; Magnusson, Patrik K.

Here we present the 1.8 angstrom high-resolution crystal structure of the human delta-opioid receptor (delta-OR), revealing the presence and fundamental role of a sodium ion in mediating allosteric control of receptor functional selectivity and constitutive activity. The distinctive delta-OR sodium ion site architecture is centrally located in a polar interaction network in the seven-transmembrane bundle core, with the sodium ion stabilizing a reduced agonist affinity state, and thereby modulating signal transduction. Site-directed mutagenesis and functional studies reveal that changing the allosteric sodium site residue Asn 131 to an alanine or a valine augments constitutive beta-arrestin-mediated signalling. Asp95Ala, Asn310Ala and Asn314Ala mutations transform classical delta-opioid antagonists such as naltrindole into potent beta-arrestin-biased agonists. The data establish the molecular basis for allosteric sodium ion control in opioid signalling, revealing that sodium-coordinating residues act as 'efficacy switches' at a prototypic G-protein-coupled receptor.","[Fenalti, Gustavo; Katritch, Vsevolod; Thompson, Aaron A.; Cherezov, Vadim; Stevens, Raymond C.] Scripps Res Inst, Dept Integrat Struct & Computat Biol, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; [Giguere, Patrick M.; Huang, Xi-Ping; Roth, Bryan L.] Univ North Carolina Chapel Hill, Sch Med, Natl Inst Mental Hlth Psychoact Drug Screening Pr, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA; [Giguere, Patrick M.; Huang, Xi-Ping; Roth, Bryan L.] Univ North Carolina Chapel Hill, Sch Med, Dept Pharmacol, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA; [Giguere, Patrick M.; Huang, Xi-Ping; Roth, Bryan L.] Univ North Carolina Chapel Hill, Sch Med, Div Chem Biol & Med Chem, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA","Stevens, RC (reprint author), Scripps Res Inst, Dept Integrat Struct & Computat Biol, 10550 North Torrey Pines Rd, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA.",bryan_roth@med.unc.edu; stevens@scripps.edu,"Roth, Bryan/F-3928-2010; Cherezov, Vadim/L-9812-2013; Katritch, Vsevolod/Q-8357-2016","Cherezov, Vadim/0000-0002-5265-3914; Stevens, Raymond/0000-0002-4522-8725; Katritch, Vsevolod/0000-0003-3883-4505","National Institutes of Health [P50 GM073197, U54 GM094618, R01 DA017204]; NIMH Psychoactive Drug Screening Program; Michael Hooker Chair for Protein Therapeutics and Translational Proteomics; National Cancer Institute [Y1-CO-1020]; National Institute of General Medical Sciences [Y1-GM-1104]","This work was supported by the National Institutes of Health Common Fund grant P50 GM073197 for technology development (V.

This is based on the assumption(5-7) that the cosmic gas was heated by stellar remnants-particularly X-ray binaries-to temperatures well above the cosmic microwave background at that time (about 30 kelvin). Here we show instead that the hard spectra (that is, spectra with more high-energy photons than low-energy photons) of X-ray binaries(8,9) make such heating ineffective, resulting in a delayed and spatially uniform heating that modifies the 21-centimetre signature of reionization. Rather than looking for a simple rise and fall of the large-scale fluctuations (peaking at several millikelvin), we must expect a more complex signal also featuring a distinct minimum (at less than a millikelvin) that marks the rise of the cosmic mean gas temperature above the microwave background. Observing this signal, possibly with radio telescopes in operation today, will demonstrate the presence of a cosmic background of hard X-rays at that early time.","[Fialkov, Anastasia; Barkana, Rennan] Tel Aviv Univ, Raymond & Beverly Sackler Sch Phys & Astron, IL-69978 Tel Aviv, Israel; [Fialkov, Anastasia] Ecole Normale Super, CNRS, Dept Phys, F-75005 Paris, France; [Visbal, Eli] Columbia Univ, Dept Astron, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Visbal, Eli] Harvard Univ, Jefferson Lab Phys, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Visbal, Eli] Harvard Univ, Inst Theory & Computat, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA","Fialkov, A (reprint author), Tel Aviv Univ, Raymond & Beverly Sackler Sch Phys & Astron, IL-69978 Tel Aviv, Israel.",anastasia.fialkov@gmail.com; barkana@wise.tau.ac.il,,,"Israel Science Foundation [823/09]; LabEx ENS-ICFP [ANR-10-LABX-0010, ANR-10-IDEX-0001-02 PSL*]","We are grateful to S.

Hysteresis is widely used in electronic circuits-it is routinely observed in superconducting circuits(3) and is essential in radio-frequency superconducting quantum interference devices(4). Furthermore, it is as fundamental to superfluidity(5) (and superconductivity) as quantized persistent currents(6-8), critical velocity(9-14) and Josephson effects(15,16). Nevertheless, despite multiple theoretical predictions(5,17-19), hysteresis has not been previously observed in any superfluid, atomic-gas Bose-Einstein condensate. Here we directly detect hysteresis between quantized circulation states in an atomtronic circuit formed from a ring of superfluid Bose-Einstein condensate obstructed by a rotating weak link (a region of low atomic density). This contrasts with previous experiments on superfluid liquid helium where hysteresis was observed directly in systems in which the quantization of flow could not be observed(20), and indirectly in systems that showed quantized flow(21,22). Our techniques allow us to tune the size of the hysteresis loop and to consider the fundamental excitations that accompany hysteresis. The results suggest that the relevant excitations involved in hysteresis are vortices, and indicate that dissipation has an important role in the dynamics. Controlled hysteresis in atomtronic circuits may prove to be a crucial feature for the development of practical devices, just as it has in electronic circuits such as memories, digital noise filters (for example Schmitt triggers) and magnetometers (for example superconducting quantum interference devices).","[Eckel, Stephen; Lee, Jeffrey G.; Jendrzejewski, Fred; Clark, Charles W.; Lobb, Christopher J.; Phillips, William D.; Campbell, Gretchen K.] NIST, Joint Quantum Inst, Gaithersburg, MD 20899 USA; [Eckel, Stephen; Lee, Jeffrey G.; Jendrzejewski, Fred; Clark, Charles W.; Lobb, Christopher J.; Phillips, William D.; Campbell, Gretchen K.] Univ Maryland, Gaithersburg, MD 20899 USA; [Murray, Noel; Edwards, Mark] Georgia So Univ, Dept Phys, Statesboro, GA 30460 USA","Campbell, GK (reprint author), NIST, Joint Quantum Inst, Gaithersburg, MD 20899 USA.",gretchen.campbell@nist.gov,"Jendrzejewski, Fred/L-2998-2016; Clark, Charles/A-8594-2009; Eckel, Stephen/K-5215-2014; Campbell, Gretchen/E-8338-2010","Jendrzejewski, Fred/0000-0003-1488-7901; Edwards, Mark/0000-0002-3149-2402; Clark, Charles/0000-0001-8724-9885; Eckel, Stephen/0000-0002-8887-0320; Campbell, Gretchen/0000-0003-2596-1919",ONR; ARO atomtronics MURI; NSF through the PFC at the JQI; National Research Council;  [PHY-1068761],"This work was partially supported by ONR, the ARO atomtronics MURI, and the NSF through the PFC at the JQI and grant PHY-1068761.

Decoherence caused by the inevitable interaction of quantum bits with their environment leads to dephasing or even relaxation. Correction of the concomitant errors is therefore a fundamental requirement for scalable quantum computation(1-7). Although algorithms for error correction have been known for some time, experimental realizations are scarce(2-7). Here we show quantum error correction in a heterogeneous, solid-state spin system(8-21). We demonstrate that joint initialization, projective readout and fast local and non-local gate operations can all be achieved in diamond spin systems, even under ambient conditions. High-fidelity initialization of a whole spin register (99 per cent) and single-shot readout of multiple individual nuclear spins are achieved by using the ancillary electron spin of a nitrogen-vacancy defect. Implementation of a novel non-local gate generic to our electron-nuclear quantum register allows the preparation of entangled states of three nuclear spins, with fidelities exceeding 85 per cent. With these techniques, we demonstrate three-qubit phase-flip error correction. Using optimal control, all of the above operations achieve fidelities approaching those needed for fault-tolerant quantum operation, thus paving the way to large-scale quantum computation. Besides their use with diamond spin systems, our techniques can be used to improve scaling of quantum networks relying on phosphorus in silicon(19), quantum dots(22), silicon carbide(11) or rare-earth ions in solids(20,21).","[Waldherr, G.; Wang, Y.; Zaiser, S.; Jamali, M.; Neumann, P.; Wrachtrup, J.] Univ Stuttgart, Inst Phys 3, D-70569 Stuttgart, Germany; [Waldherr, G.; Wang, Y.; Zaiser, S.; Jamali, M.; Neumann, P.; Wrachtrup, J.] Univ Stuttgart, Res Ctr SCOPE, D-70569 Stuttgart, Germany; [Schulte-Herbrueggen, T.] Tech Univ Munich, Dept Chem, D-85747 Garching, Germany; [Abe, H.; Ohshima, T.] Japan Atom Energy Agcy, Takasaki, Gunma 3701292, Japan; [Isoya, J.] Univ Tsukuba, Res Ctr Knowledge Communities, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058550, Japan; [Du, J.

The formation of quasicrystals(7-9) from such a broad range of 'soft' macromolecular micelles suggests that they assemble by a generic mechanism rather than being dependent on the specific chemistry of each system. Indeed, micellar softness has been postulated(7) and shown to lead to quasicrystalline order(10). Here we theoretically explore this link by studying two-dimensional hard disks decorated with step-like square-shoulder repulsion that mimics, for example, the soft alkyl shell around the aromatic core in dendritic micelles(2). We find a family of quasicrystals with 10-, 12-, 18- and 24-fold bond orientational order which originate from mosaics of equilateral and isosceles triangles formed by particles arranged core-to-core and shoulder-to-shoulder. The pair interaction responsible for these phases highlights the role of local packing geometry in generating quasicrystallinity in soft matter, complementing the principles that lead to quasicrystal formation in hard tetrahedra(11,12). Based on simple interparticle potentials, quasicrystalline mosaics may well find use in diverse applications ranging from improved image reproduction(13) to advanced photonic materials(14).","[Dotera, T.; Oshiro, T.] Kinki Univ, Dept Phys, Higashiosaka, Osaka 5778502, Japan; [Ziherl, P.] Univ Ljubljana, Fac Math & Phys, SI-1000 Ljubljana, Slovenia; [Ziherl, P.] Jozef Stefan Inst, SI-1000 Ljubljana, Slovenia","Dotera, T (reprint author), Kinki Univ, Dept Phys, 3-4-1 Kowakae, Higashiosaka, Osaka 5778502, Japan.",dotera@phys.kindai.ac.jp,,"Ziherl, Primoz/0000-0002-5989-6679",Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [22540375]; Slovenian Research Agency [P1-0055]; Marie-Curie Initial Training Network COMPLOIDS under FP7-PEOPLE-ITN [234810],"We thank J.

But available data(3-5) are too limited at present to test the predicted changes in the tropical carbon balance in response to climate change. Long-term atmospheric carbon dioxide data provide a global record that integrates the interannual variability of the global carbon balance. Multiple lines of evidence(6-8) demonstrate that most of this variability originates in the terrestrial biosphere. In particular, the year-to-year variations in the atmospheric carbon dioxide growth rate (CGR) are thought to be the result of fluctuations in the carbon fluxes of tropical land areas(6,9,10). Recently, the response of CGR to tropical climate interannual variability was used to put a constraint on the sensitivity of tropical land carbon to climate change(10). Here we use the long-term CGR record from Mauna Loa and the South Pole to show that the sensitivity of CGR to tropical temperature interannual variability has increased by a factor of 1.9 +/- 0.3 in the past five decades. We find that this sensitivity was greater when tropical land regions experienced drier conditions. This suggests that the sensitivity of CGR to interannual temperature variations is regulated by moisture conditions, even though the direct correlation between CGR and tropical precipitation is weak(9). We also find that present terrestrial carbon cycle models do not capture the observed enhancement in CGR sensitivity in the past five decades. More realistic model predictions of future carbon cycle and climate feedbacks require a better understanding of the processes driving the response of tropical ecosystems to drought and warming.","[Wang, Xuhui; Piao, Shilong; Ciais, Philippe; Peng, Shushi; Wang, Tao; Yang, Hui] Peking Univ, Sinofrench Inst Earth Syst Sci, Coll Urban & Environm Sci, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China; [Piao, Shilong] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Tibetan Plateau Res, Beijing 100085, Peoples R China; [Ciais, Philippe; Wang, Tao] CEA CNRS UVSQ, Lab Sci Climat & Environm, F-91191 Gif Sur Yvette, France; [Friedlingstein, Pierre; Cox, Peter] Univ Exeter, Coll Engn Math & Phys Sci, Exeter EX4 4QF, Devon, England; [Myneni, Ranga B.] Boston Univ, Dept Earth & Environm, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Heimann, Martin] Max Planck Inst Biogeochem, D-07701 Jena, Germany; [Miller, John] NOAA, Global Monitoring Div, Earth Syst Res Lab, Boulder, CO 80305 USA; [Miller, John] Univ Colorado, Cooperat Inst Res Environm Sci, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Chen, Anping] Princeton Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA","Piao, SL (reprint author), Peking Univ, Sinofrench Inst Earth Syst Sci, Coll Urban & Environm Sci, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China.",slpiao@pku.edu.cn,"Myneni, Ranga/F-5129-2012; Friedlingstein, Pierre/H-2700-2014; Peng, Shushi/J-4779-2014; Chen, Anping/H-9960-2014; wang, tao/H-2830-2013; Heimann, Martin/H-7807-2016; Cox, Peter/B-3299-2012","Peng, Shushi/0000-0001-5098-726X; wang, tao/0000-0003-4792-5898; Heimann, Martin/0000-0001-6296-5113; Wang, Xuhui/0000-0003-0818-9816","National Natural Science Foundation of China [41125004]; National Basic Research Program of China [2010CB950601, 2013CB956303]; National Youth Top-notch Talent Support Program in China; NASA Earth Science Division","We thank S.

MPAs often fail to reach their full potential as a consequence of factors such as illegal harvesting, regulations that legally allow detrimental harvesting, or emigration of animals outside boundaries because of continuous habitat or inadequate size of reserve(3-5). Here we show that the conservation benefits of 87 MPAs investigated worldwide increase exponentially with the accumulation of five key features: no take, well enforced, old (>10 years), large (>100 km(2)), and isolated by deep water or sand. Using effective MPAs with four or five key features as an unfished standard, comparisons of underwater survey data from effective MPAs with predictions based on survey data from fished coasts indicate that total fish biomass has declined about two-thirds from historical baselines as a result of fishing. Effective MPAs also had twice as many large (>250 mm total length) fish species per transect, five times more large fish biomass, and fourteen times more shark biomass than fished areas. Most (59%) of the MPAs studied had only one or two key features and were not ecologically distinguishable from fished sites. Our results show that global conservation targets based on area alone will not optimize protection of marine biodiversity. More emphasis is needed on better MPA design, durable management and compliance to ensure that MPAs achieve their desired conservation value.","[Edgar, Graham J.; Stuart-Smith, Rick D.; Kininmonth, Stuart; Barrett, Neville S.; Berkhout, Just; Buxton, Colin D.; Cooper, Antonia T.; Davey, Marlene; Soler, German; Thomson, Russell J.] Univ Tasmania, Inst Marine & Antarctic Studies, Hobart, Tas 7001, Australia; [Willis, Trevor J.] Univ Portsmouth, Inst Marine Sci, Sch Biol Sci, Portsmouth PO4 9LY, Hants, England; [Kininmonth, Stuart] Stockholm Univ, Stockholm Resilience Ctr, SE-10691 Stockholm, Sweden; [Baker, Susan C.] Univ Tasmania, Sch Plant Sci, Hobart, Tas 7001, Australia; [Banks, Stuart] Charles Darwin Fdn, Puerto Ayora, Galapagos, Ecuador; [Becerro, Mikel A.] Nat Prod & Agrobiol Inst IPNA CSIC, Bites Lab, San Cristobal la Laguna 38206, Tenerife, Spain; [Bernard, Anthony T.

Previous studies have suggested that light is more limiting than water for tropical forest productivity(2), consistent with greening of Amazon forests during the dry season in satellite data(3-7). We evaluated four potential mechanisms for the seasonal green-up phenomenon, including increases in leaf area(5-7) or leaf reflectance(3,4,6), using a sophisticated radiative transfer model(8) and independent satellite observations from lidar and optical sensors. Here we show that the apparent green up of Amazon forests in optical remote sensing data resulted from seasonal changes in near-infrared reflectance, an artefact of variations in sun-sensor geometry. Correcting this bidirectional reflectance effect eliminated seasonal changes in surface reflectance, consistent with independent lidar observations and model simulations with unchanging canopy properties. The stability of Amazon forest structure and reflectance over seasonal timescales challenges the paradigm of light-limited net primary production in Amazon forests and enhanced forest growth during drought conditions. Correcting optical remote sensing data for artefacts of sun-sensor geometry is essential to isolate the response of global vegetation to seasonal and interannual climate variability.","[Morton, Douglas C.; Carabajal, Claudia C.; Rosette, Jacqueline; Cook, Bruce D.; Vermote, Eric F.; Harding, David J.] NASA, Goddard Space Flight Ctr, Greenbelt, MD 20771 USA; [Nagol, Jyoteshwar; Rosette, Jacqueline] Univ Maryland, Dept Geog Sci, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Nagol, Jyoteshwar] Global Land Cover Facil, College Pk, MD 20740 USA; [Carabajal, Claudia C.] Sigma Space Corp, Lanham, MD 20706 USA; [Rosette, Jacqueline; North, Peter R.

Nearly 50 years of archaeological research point to the Clovis complex as having developed south of the North American ice sheets from an ancestral technology(3). However, both the origins and the genetic legacy of the people who manufactured Clovis tools remain under debate. It is generally believed that these people ultimately derived from Asia and were directly related to contemporary Native Americans(2). An alternative, Solutrean, hypothesis posits that the Clovis predecessors emigrated from southwestern Europe during the Last Glacial Maximum(4). Here we report the genome sequence of a male infant (Anzick-1) recovered from the Anzick burial site in western Montana. The human bones date to 10,705 +/- 35 C-14 years BP (approximately 12,707-12,556 calendar years BP) and were directly associated with Clovis tools. We sequenced the genome to an average depth of 14.4x and show that the gene flow from the Siberian Upper Palaeolithic Mal'ta population(5) into Native American ancestors is also shared by the Anzick-1 individual and thus happened before 12,600 years BP. We also show that the Anzick-1 individual is more closely related to all indigenous American populations than to any other group. Our data are compatible with the hypothesis that Anzick-1 belonged to a population directly ancestral to many contemporary Native Americans. Finally, we find evidence of a deep divergence in Native American populations that predates the Anzick-1 individual.","[Rasmussen, Morten; Stafford, Thomas W., Jr.; Malaspinas, Anna-Sapfo; Allentoft, Morten E.; Korneliussen, Thorfinn Sand; Pierre, Tracey L.; Stenderup, Jesper; Orlando, Ludovic; Willerslev, Eske] Univ Copenhagen, Nat Hist Museum Denmark, Ctr GeoGenet, DK-1350 Copenhagen K, Denmark; [Anzick, Sarah L.] Anzick Family, Livingston, MT 59047 USA; [Waters, Michael R.] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Anthropol, Ctr Study Amer 1, College Stn, TX 77843 USA; [Waters, Michael R.] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Geog, Ctr Study Amer 1, College Stn, TX 77843 USA; [Skoglund, Pontus; Jakobsson, Mattias] Uppsala Univ, Dept Evolutionary Biol, S-75236 Uppsala, Sweden; [DeGiorgio, Michael; Nielsen, Rasmus] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Integrat Biol, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Stafford, Thomas W., Jr.] Univ Aarhus, Dept Phys & Astron, AMS Dating Ctr 14C, DK-8000 Aarhus C, Denmark; [Rasmussen, Simon; Gudmundsdottir, Valborg; Yadav, Rachita; Brunak, Soren; Sicheritz-Ponten, Thomas; Gupta, Ramneek] Tech Univ Denmark, Dept Syst Biol, Ctr Biol Sequence Anal, DK-2800 Lyngby, Denmark; [Moltke, Ida; Albrechtsen, Anders] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Biol, Bioinformat Ctr, DK-2200 Copenhagen N, Denmark; [Moltke, Ida] Univ Chicago, Dept Human Genet, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Doyle, Shane M.] Montana State Univ, Dept Educ, Bozeman, MT 59717 USA; [Poznik, G.

Diffuse white matter injury (DWMI) is a common finding in these children and results in chronic neurodevelopmental impairments(1,2). As shown recently, failure in oligodendrocyte progenitor cell maturation contributes to DWMI3. We demonstrated previously that the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) has an important role in oligodendrocyte development(4). Here we examine whether enhanced EGFR signalling stimulates the endogenous response of EGFR-expressing progenitor cells during a critical period after brain injury, and promotes cellular and behavioural recovery in the developing brain. Using an established mouse model of very preterm brain injury, we demonstrate that selective overexpression of human EGFR in oligodendrocyte lineage cells or the administration of intranasal heparin-binding EGF immediately after injury decreases oligodendroglia death, enhances generation of new oligodendrocytes from progenitor cells and promotes functional recovery. Furthermore, these interventions diminish ultrastructural abnormalities and alleviate behavioural deficits on white-matter-specific paradigms. Inhibition of EGFR signalling with a molecularly targeted agent used for cancer therapy demonstrates that EGFR activation is an important contributor to oligodendrocyte regeneration and functional recovery after DWMI. Thus, our study provides direct evidence that targeting EGFR in oligodendrocyte progenitor cells at a specific time after injury is clinically feasible and potentially applicable to the treatment of premature children with white matter injury.","[Scafidi, Joseph; Hammond, Timothy R.; Ritter, Jonathan; Jablonska, Beata; Roncal, Maria; Gallo, Vittorio] Childrens Natl Med Ctr, Neurosci Res Ctr, Washington, DC 20010 USA; [Scafidi, Joseph] Childrens Natl Med Ctr, Dept Neurol, Washington, DC 20010 USA; [Hammond, Timothy R.] George Washington Univ, Inst Biomed Sci, Washington, DC 20052 USA; [Scafidi, Susanna] Johns Hopkins Univ, Sch Med, Dept Anesthesiol & Crit Care Med, Baltimore, MD 21287 USA; [Szigeti-Buck, Klara] Yale Univ, Dept Neurobiol, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Coman, Daniel; Huang, Yuegao; Hyder, Fahmeed] Yale Univ, Dept Diagnost Radiol, MRRC, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [McCarter, Robert J., Jr.] Childrens Natl Med Ctr, Ctr Translat Sci, Washington, DC 20010 USA","Gallo, V (reprint author), Childrens Natl Med Ctr, Neurosci Res Ctr, Washington, DC 20010 USA.",vgallo@childrensnational.org,"Hyder, Fahmeed/A-2644-2015","Hyder, Fahmeed/0000-0001-7822-4002","National Institutes of Health [K08NS073793, NSADA K12NS052159, K08NS069815, P01 NS062686, R01NS045702, R01NS056427, P30HD040677, R01MH067528, P30 NS05219, DP1 OD006850]; Childhood Brain Tumor Foundation; National Brain Tumor Society","We thank J.

However, how C/EBP alpha accomplishes these effects is unclear. Here we find that in mouse primary B cells transient C/EBP alpha expression followed by OSKM activation induces a 100-fold increase in iPS cell reprogramming efficiency, involving 95% of the population. During this conversion, pluripotency and epithelial-mesenchymal transition genes become markedly upregulated, and 60% of the cells express Oct4 within 2 days. C/EBP alpha acts as a 'path-breaker' as it transiently makes the chromatin of pluripotency genes more accessible to DNase I. C/EBP alpha also induces the expression of the dioxygenase Tet2 and promotes its translocation to the nucleus where it binds to regulatory regions of pluripotency genes that become demethylated after OSKM induction. In line with these findings, overexpression of Tet2 enhances OSKM-induced B-cell reprogramming. Because the enzyme is also required for efficient C/EBP alpha-induced immune cell conversion(3), our data indicate that Tet2 provides a mechanistic link between iPS cell reprogramming and B-cell transdifferentiation. The rapid iPS reprogramming approach described here should help to fully elucidate the process and has potential clinical applications.","[Di Stefano, Bruno; Sardina, Jose Luis; van Oevelen, Chris; Kallin, Eric M.; Vicent, Guillermo P.; Beato, Miguel; Graf, Thomas] CRG, Gene Regulat Stem Cells & Canc Programme, Barcelona 08003, Spain; [Di Stefano, Bruno; Sardina, Jose Luis; van Oevelen, Chris; Kallin, Eric M.; Vicent, Guillermo P.; Beato, Miguel; Graf, Thomas] UPF, Barcelona 08003, Spain; [Collombet, Samuel; Thieffry, Denis] ENS, Inst Biol, F-75005 Paris, France; [Collombet, Samuel; Thieffry, Denis] INSERM, U1024, F-75005 Paris, France; [Collombet, Samuel; Thieffry, Denis] CNRS, UMR 8197, F-75005 Paris, France; [Lu, Jun] Yale Univ, Sch Med, Yale Canc Ctr, New Haven, CT 06510 USA; [Graf, Thomas] Pg Lluis Co 23, ICREA, Barcelona 08010, Spain","Graf, T (reprint author), UPF, Dr Aiguader 88, Barcelona 08003, Spain.",Thomas.Graf@crg.eu,"Graf, Thomas/B-4252-2015; Beato, Miguel/B-5564-2015; Sardina, Jose Luis/H-7047-2015; Di Stefano, Bruno/H-7232-2015; Di Stefano, Bruno/K-5020-2017","Graf, Thomas/0000-0003-2774-4117; Beato, Miguel/0000-0002-2878-2222; Sardina, Jose Luis/0000-0002-8493-3937; Di Stefano, Bruno/0000-0003-2532-3087; Di Stefano, Bruno/0000-0003-2532-3087; Thieffry, Denis/0000-0003-0271-1757","Ministerio de Educacion y Ciencia [SAF.2007-63058, AGAUR 2009 SGR768]; La Caixa International PhD Fellowship; ICREA","We thank L.

Osteoblasts were recently implicated in pre-leukaemic conditions in mice(8,9). However, a single genetic change in osteoblasts that can induce leukaemogenesis has not been shown. Here we show that an activating mutation of beta-catenin in mouse osteoblasts alters the differentiation potential of myeloid and lymphoid progenitors leading to development of acute myeloid leukaemia with common chromosomal aberrations and cell autonomous progression. Activated beta-catenin stimulates expression of the Notch ligand jagged 1 in osteoblasts. Subsequent activation of Notch signalling in haematopoietic stem cell progenitors induces the malignant changes. Genetic or pharmacological inhibition of Notch signalling ameliorates acute myeloid leukaemia and demonstrates the pathogenic role of the Notch pathway. In 38% of patients with myelodysplastic syndromes or acute myeloid leukaemia, increased beta-catenin signalling and nuclear accumulation was identified in osteoblasts and these patients showed increased Notch signalling in haematopoietic cells. These findings demonstrate that genetic alterations in osteoblasts can induce acute myeloid leukaemia, identify molecular signals leading to this transformation and suggest a potential novel pharmacotherapeutic approach to acute myeloid leukaemia.","[Kode, Aruna; Manavalan, John S.; Mosialou, Ioanna; Luo, Na; Brum, Andrea; Kousteni, Stavroula] Columbia Univ, Coll Phys & Surg, Dept Med, Div Endocrinol, New York, NY 10032 USA; [Bhagat, Govind] Columbia Univ, Coll Phys & Surg, Dept Pathol & Cell Biol, New York, NY 10032 USA; [Rathinam, Chozha V.] Columbia Univ, Coll Phys & Surg, Dept Genet & Dev, New York, NY 10032 USA; [Khiabanian, Hossein; Lee, Albert; Rabadan, Raul] Columbia Univ, Dept Biomed Informat, New York, NY 10032 USA; [Khiabanian, Hossein; Lee, Albert; Rabadan, Raul] Columbia Univ, Ctr Computat Biol & Bioinformat, New York, NY 10032 USA; [Murty, Vundavalli V.] Columbia Univ, Dept Pathol, New York, NY 10032 USA; [Murty, Vundavalli V.] Columbia Univ, Inst Canc Genet, Irving Canc Res Ctr, New York, NY 10032 USA; [Friedman, Richard] Columbia Univ, Coll Phys & Surg, Herbert Irving Comprehens Canc Ctr, Biomed Informat Shared Resource, New York, NY 10032 USA; [Friedman, Richard] Columbia Univ, Coll Phys & Surg, Dept Biomed Informat, New York, NY 10032 USA; [Brum, Andrea] Erasmus MC, Dept Internal Med, NL-3015 GE Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Park, David; Teruya-Feldstein, Julie] Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Dept Pathol, New York, NY 10021 USA; [Galili, Naomi; Raza, Azra] Columbia Univ, Myelodysplast Syndromes Ctr, New York, NY 10032 USA; [Mukherjee, Siddhartha] Columbia Univ, Dept Med Hematol, New York, NY 10032 USA; [Mukherjee, Siddhartha] Columbia Univ, Dept Oncol, New York, NY 10032 USA; [Berman, Ellin] Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Dept Med, Leukemia Serv, New York, NY 10021 USA; [Kousteni, Stavroula] Columbia Univ, Coll Phys & Surg, Dept Physiol & Cellular Biophys, New York, NY 10032 USA","Kousteni, S (reprint author), Columbia Univ, Coll Phys & Surg, Dept Med, Div Endocrinol, New York, NY 10032 USA.",sk2836@columbia.edu,,"Brum, Andrea/0000-0001-6881-1123; Khiabanian, Hossein/0000-0003-1446-4394","National Institutes of Health [R01 AR054447, P01 AG032959, R01 AR055931]; Division of Hematologic Oncology, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York; European Union [INTERBONE-FP7-PEOPLE-2011-IRSES-295181]","The authors are grateful to M.

This is primarily attributed to the ease with which these viruses mutate to disrupt recognition and growth suppression by host miRNAs(2,3). Here we report that the haematopoietic-cell-specific miRNA miR-142-3p potently restricts the replication of the mosquito-borne North American eastern equine encephalitis virus in myeloid-lineage cells by binding to sites in the 3' non-translated region of its RNA genome. However, by limiting myeloid cell tropism and consequent innate immunity induction, this restriction directly promotes neurologic disease manifestations characteristic of eastern equine encephalitis virus infection in humans. Furthermore, the region containing the miR-142-3p binding sites is essential for efficient virus infection of mosquito vectors. We propose that RNA viruses can adapt to use antiviral properties of vertebrate miRNAs to limit replication in particular cell types and that this restriction can lead to exacerbation of disease severity.","[Trobaugh, Derek W.; Gardner, Christina L.; Sun, Chengqun; Ryman, Kate D.; Klimstra, William B.] Univ Pittsburgh, Ctr Vaccine Res, Pittsburgh, PA 15261 USA; [Trobaugh, Derek W.; Gardner, Christina L.; Sun, Chengqun; Ryman, Kate D.; Klimstra, William B.] Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Microbiol & Mol Genet, Pittsburgh, PA 15261 USA; [Haddow, Andrew D.; Wang, Eryu; Weaver, Scott C.] Univ Texas Med Branch, Ctr Biodef & Emerging Infect Dis, Inst Human Infect & Immun, Galveston, TX 77555 USA; [Haddow, Andrew D.; Wang, Eryu; Weaver, Scott C.] Univ Texas Med Branch, Dept Pathol, Galveston, TX 77555 USA; [Chapnik, Elik] Weizmann Inst Sci, Dept Mol Genet, IL-7610001 Rehovot, Israel; [Mildner, Alexander] Weizmann Inst Sci, Dept Immunol, IL-7610001 Rehovot, Israel","Klimstra, WB (reprint author), Univ Pittsburgh, Ctr Vaccine Res, Pittsburgh, PA 15261 USA.",klimstra@pitt.edu,"Weaver, Scott/D-6490-2011; Haddow, Andrew/C-5902-2008","Haddow, Andrew/0000-0002-8957-2608; mildner, alexander/0000-0002-2019-8427","National Institutes of Health (NIH) [AI049820-10, AI060525-08, AI083383, AI095436]; National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases through the Pacific Northwest Regional Centers for Excellence in Biodefense and Emerging Infectious Diseases Research [U54 AI081680]","We thank M.

Although many reactions that occur during homologous recombination are known(1-3), it is unclear where, when and how they occur in cells. Here, by using conventional and super-resolution microscopy, we describe the progression of DSB repair in live Escherichia coli. Specifically, we investigate whether homologous recombination can occur efficiently between distant sister loci that have segregated to opposite halves of an E. coli cell. We show that a site-specific DSB in one sister can be repaired efficiently using distant sister homology. After RecBCD processing of the DSB, RecA is recruited to the cut locus, where it nucleates into a bundle that contains many more RecA molecules than can associate with the two single-stranded DNA regions that format the DSB. Mature bundles extend along the long axis of the cell, in the space between the bulk nucleoid and the inner membrane. Bundle formation is followed by pairing, in which the two ends of the cut locus relocate at the periphery of the nucleoid and together move rapidly towards the homology of the uncut sister. After sister locus pairing, RecA bundles disassemble and proteins that act late in homologous recombination are recruited to give viable recombinants 1-2-generation-time equivalents after formation of the initial DSB. Mutated RecA proteins that do not form bundles are defective in sister pairing and in DSB-induced repair. This work reveals an unanticipated role of RecA bundles in channelling the movement of the DNA DSB ends, thereby facilitating the long-range homology search that occurs before the strand invasion and transfer reactions.","[Lesterlin, Christian; Ball, Graeme; Schermelleh, Lothar; Sherratt, David J.] Univ Oxford, Dept Biochem, Oxford OX1 3QU, England","Sherratt, DJ (reprint author), Univ Oxford, Dept Biochem, Oxford OX1 3QU, England.",david.sherratt@bioch.ox.ac.uk,,"Lesterlin, Christian/0000-0002-9108-0848; Schermelleh, Lothar/0000-0002-1612-9699",EMBO long-term fellowship [LTF-535-2009]; Wellcome Trust Programme Grant [WT083469MA]; Wellcome Trust Strategic Award [091911],"This work was supported by an EMBO long-term fellowship to C.

Here we present 50 thousand years (kyr) of Arctic vegetation history, derived from the first large-scale ancient DNA metabarcoding study of circumpolar plant diversity. For this interval we also explore nematode diversity as a proxy for modelling vegetation cover and soil quality, and diets of herbivorous megafaunal mammals, many of which became extinct around 10 kyr BP (before present). For much of the period investigated, Arctic vegetation consisted of dry steppe-tundra dominated by forbs (non-graminoid herbaceous vascular plants). During the Last Glacial Maximum (25-15 kyr BP), diversity declined markedly, although forbs remained dominant. Much changed after 10 kyr BP, with the appearance of moist tundra dominated by woody plants and graminoids.

However, the regulatory switches controlling T-cell function in immunosuppressive tumours are not well understood. Here we show that such inhibitory mechanisms can be systematically discovered in the tumour microenvironment. We devised an in vivo pooled short hairpin RNA (shRNA) screen in which shRNAs targeting negative regulators became highly enriched in murine tumours by releasing a block on T-cell proliferation upon tumour antigen recognition. Such shRNAs were identified by deep sequencing of the shRNA cassette from T cells infiltrating tumour or control tissues. One of the target genes was Ppp2r2d, a regulatory subunit of the PP2A phosphatase family. In tumours, Ppp2r2d knockdown inhibited T-cell apoptosis and enhanced T-cell proliferation as well as cytokine production. Key regulators of immune function can therefore be discovered in relevant tissue microenvironments.","[Zhou, Penghui; Shaffer, Donald R.; Arias, Diana A.

However, such 'talented' producers represent only a minute fraction of the entire, mostly uncultivated, prokaryotic diversity. The uncultured majority is generally perceived as a large, untapped resource of new drug candidates, but so far it is unknown whether taxa containing talented bacteria indeed exist. Here we report the single-cell- and metagenomics-based discovery of such producers. Two phylotypes of the candidate genus 'Entotheonella' with genomes of greater than 9 megabases and multiple, distinct biosynthetic gene clusters co-inhabit the chemically and microbially rich marine sponge Theonella swinhoei. Almost all bioactive polyketides and peptides known from this animal were attributed to a single phylotype. 'Entotheonella' spp. are widely distributed in sponges and belong to an environmental taxon proposed here as candidate phylum 'Tectomicrobia'. The pronounced bioactivities and chemical uniqueness of 'Entotheonella' compounds provide significant opportunities for ecological studies and drug discovery.","[Wilson, Micheal C.; Uria, Agustinus R.; Helf, Maximilian J.; Helfrich, Eric J.

This material has been studied for decades in absorption against background sources(3), but the sparseness of these inherently one-dimensional probes preclude direct constraints on the three-dimensional morphology of the underlying web. Here we report observations of a cosmic web filament in Lyman-alpha emission, discovered during a survey for cosmic gas fluorescently illuminated by bright quasars(4,5) at redshift z approximate to 2.3. With a linear projected size of approximately 460 physical kiloparsecs, the Lyman-alpha emission surrounding the radio-quiet quasar UM287 extends well beyond the virial radius of any plausible associated dark-matter halo and therefore traces intergalactic gas. The estimated cold gas mass of the filament from the observed emission-about 10(12.0 +/- 0.5)/C-1/2 solar masses, where C is the gas clumping factor-is more than ten times larger than what is typically found in cosmological simulations(5,6), suggesting that a population of intergalactic gas clumps with subkiloparsec sizes may be missing in current numerical models.","[Cantalupo, Sebastiano; Prochaska, J.

Historically, parity violation in electron scattering has been important in establishing (and now testing) the standard model of particle physics. One particular set of quantities accessible through measurements of parity-violating electron scattering are the effective weak couplings C-2q, sensitive to the quarks' chirality preference when participating in the weak force, which have been measured directly(3,4) only once in the past 40 years. Here we report a measurement of the parity-violating asymmetry in electron-quark scattering, which yields a determination of 2C(2u)-C-2d (where u and d denote up and down quarks, respectively) with a precision increased by a factor of five relative to the earlier result. These results provide evidence with greater than 95 per cent confidence that the C-2q couplings are non-zero, as predicted by the electroweak theory. They lead to constraints on new parity-violating interactions beyond the standard model, particularly those due to quark chirality. Whereas contemporary particle physics research is focused on high-energy colliders such as the Large Hadron Collider, our results provide specific chirality information on electroweak theory that is difficult to obtain at high energies. Our measurement is relatively free of ambiguity in its interpretation, and opens the door to even more precise measurements in the future.","[Wang, D.; Subedi, R.; Deng, X.; Cates, G. D.; Dalton, M.

At the same time, atomic clock research has helped to advance the frontiers of science, affecting both fundamental and applied research. The ability to control quantum states of individual atoms and photons is central to quantum information science and precision measurement, and optical clocks based on single ions have achieved the lowest systematic uncertainty of any frequency standard(3-5). Although many-atom lattice clocks have shown advantages in measurement precision over trapped-ion clocks(6,7), their accuracy has remained 16 times worse(8-10). Here we demonstrate a many-atom system that achieves an accuracy of 6.4x10(-18), which is not only better than a single-ion-based clock, but also reduces the required measurement time by two orders of magnitude. By systematically evaluating all known sources of uncertainty, including in situ monitoring of the blackbody radiation environment, we improve the accuracy of optical lattice clocks by a factor of 22. This single clock has simultaneously achieved the best known performance in the key characteristics necessary for consideration as a primary standard-stability and accuracy. More stable and accurate atomic clocks will benefit a wide range of fields, such as the realization and distribution of SI units(11), the search for time variation of fundamental constants(12), clock-based geodesy(13) and other precision tests of the fundamental laws of nature. This work also connects to the development of quantum sensors and many-body quantum state engineering(14) (such as spin squeezing) to advance measurement precision beyond the standard quantum limit.","[Bloom, B.

Estimates of the sensitivity of the terrestrial carbon budget to climate anomalies in the tropics and the identification of the mechanisms responsible for feedback effects remain uncertain(3,4). The Amazon basin stores a vast amount of carbon(5), and has experienced increasingly higher temperatures and more frequent floods and droughts over the past two decades(6). Here we report seasonal and annual carbon balances across the Amazon basin, based on carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide measurements for the anomalously dry and wet years 2010 and 2011, respectively. We find that the Amazon basin lost 0.48 +/- 0.18 petagrams of carbon per year (Pg C yr(-1)) during the dry year but was carbon neutral (0.06 +/- 0.1 Pg C yr(-1)) during the wet year. Taking into account carbon losses from fire by using carbon monoxide measurements, we derived the basin net biome exchange (that is, the carbon flux between the non-burned forest and the atmosphere) revealing that during the dry year, vegetation was carbon neutral. During the wet year, vegetation was a net carbon sink of 0.25 +/- 0.14 Pg C yr(-1), which is roughly consistent with the mean long-term intact-forest biomass sink of 0.39 +/- 0.10 Pg C yr(-1) previously estimated from forest censuses(7). Observations from Amazonian forest plots suggest the suppression of photosynthesis during drought as the primary cause for the 2010 sink neutralization. Overall, our results suggest that moisture has an important role in determining the Amazonian carbon balance. If the recent trend of increasing precipitation extremes persists(6), the Amazon may become an increasing carbon source as a result of both emissions from fires and the suppression of net biome exchange by drought.","[Gatti, L.

Mercury and ozone are rapidly removed from the atmospheric boundary layer during depletion events in the Arctic(5-7), caused by destruction of ozone along with oxidation of gaseous elemental mercury (Hg(0)) to oxidized mercury (Hg(II)) in the atmosphere and its subsequent deposition to snow and ice(5). Ozone depletion events can change the oxidative capacity of the air by affecting atmospheric hydroxyl radical chemistry(8), whereas atmospheric mercury depletion events can increase the deposition of mercury to the Arctic(6,9-11), some of which can enter ecosystems during snowmelt(12). Here we present near-surface measurements of atmospheric mercury and ozone from two Arctic field campaigns near Barrow, Alaska. We find that coastal depletion events are directly linked to sea-ice dynamics. A consolidated ice cover facilitates the depletion of Hg(0) and ozone, but these immediately recover to near-background concentrations in the upwind presence of open sea-ice leads. We attribute the rapid recoveries of Hg(0) and ozone to lead-initiated shallow convection in the stable Arctic boundary layer, which mixes Hg(0) and ozone from undepleted air masses aloft. This convective forcing provides additional Hg(0) to the surface layer at a time of active depletion chemistry, where it is subject to renewed oxidation. Future work will need to establish the degree to which large-scale changes in sea-ice dynamics across the Arctic alter ozone chemistry and mercury deposition in fragile Arctic ecosystems.","[Moore, Christopher W.; Obrist, Daniel] Desert Res Inst, Div Atmospher Sci, Reno, NV 89523 USA; [Steffen, Alexandra; Staebler, Ralf M.] Environm Canada, Air Qual Proc Res Sect, Toronto, ON M3H 5T4, Canada; [Douglas, Thomas A.] US Army Cold Reg Res & Engn Lab, Ft Wainwright, AK 99703 USA; [Richter, Andreas] Univ Bremen, Inst Environm Phys, D-28359 Bremen, Germany; [Nghiem, Son V.] CALTECH, Jet Prop Lab, Pasadena, CA 91109 USA","Moore, CW (reprint author), Desert Res Inst, Div Atmospher Sci, Reno, NV 89523 USA.",chris.moore@dri.edu,"Moore, Christopher/E-8448-2012","Moore, Christopher/0000-0002-6042-5583; Richter, Andreas/0000-0003-3339-212X",National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA); Desert Research Institute; Science and Technology Branch of Environment Canada; Canadian International Polar Year government programme; NASA CSP,"This research was supported in part by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Cryospheric Sciences Program (CSP) and by the Desert Research Institute.

The Janzen-Connell hypothesis(3,4) suggests that specialized natural enemies such as insect herbivores and fungal pathogens maintain high diversity by elevating mortality when plant species occur at high density (negative density dependence; NDD). NDD has been detected widely in tropical forests(5-9), but the prediction that NDD caused by insects and pathogens has a community-wide role in maintaining tropical plant diversity remains untested. We show experimentally that changes in plant diversity and species composition are caused by fungal pathogens and insect herbivores. Effective plant species richness increased across the seed-to-seedling transition, corresponding to large changes in species composition(5). Treating seeds and young seedlings with fungicides significantly reduced the diversity of the seedling assemblage, consistent with the Janzen-Connell hypothesis. Although suppressing insect herbivores using insecticides did not alter species diversity, it greatly increased seedling recruitment and caused a marked shift in seedling species composition. Overall, seedling recruitment was significantly reduced at high con-specific seed densities and this NDD was greatest for the species that were most abundant as seeds. Suppressing fungi reduced the negative effects of density on recruitment, confirming that the diversity enhancing effect of fungi is mediated by NDD. Our study provides an overall test of the Janzen-Connell hypothesis and demonstrates the crucial role that insects and pathogens have both in structuring tropical plant communities and in maintaining their remarkable diversity.","[Bagchi, Robert; Gallery, Rachel E.; Gripenberg, Sofia; Narayan, Lakshmi; Addis, Claire E.; Lewis, Owen T.] Univ Oxford, Dept Zool, Oxford OX1 3PS, England; [Bagchi, Robert] ETH, Inst Terr Ecosyst, Ecosyst Management Grp, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland; [Gallery, Rachel E.] Univ Arizona, Sch Nat Resources & Environm, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA; [Gripenberg, Sofia] Univ Turku, Dept Biol, Sect Biodivers & Environm Res, Turku 20014, Finland; [Gurr, Sarah J.] Univ Exeter, Dept Biosci, Exeter EX4 4QD, Devon, England; [Gurr, Sarah J.] Univ Oxford, Dept Plant Sci, Oxford OX1 3RB, England; [Freckleton, Robert P.] Univ Sheffield, Dept Anim & Plant Sci, Sheffield S10 2TN, S Yorkshire, England","Lewis, OT (reprint author), Univ Oxford, Dept Zool, S Parks Rd, Oxford OX1 3PS, England.",owen.lewis@zoo.ox.ac.uk,"Bagchi, Robert/F-1732-2011","Bagchi, Robert/0000-0003-4035-4105; Freckleton, Robert/0000-0002-8338-864X",Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) [NE/DO10721/1]; Academy of Finland [126296],"Permission to undertake research in the Chiquibul Forest Reserve was granted by the Ministry of Natural Resources, Belize under Scientific Collection/Research Permit CD/60/3/07(20).

This lineage has since radiated into almost every climate, with manifold growth forms(4). As angiosperms spread and climate changed, they evolved mechanisms to cope with episodic freezing. To explore the evolution of traits underpinning the ability to persist in freezing conditions, we assembled a large species-level database of growth habit (woody or herbaceous; 49,064 species), as well as leaf phenology (evergreen or deciduous), diameter of hydraulic conduits (that is, xylem vessels and tracheids) and climate occupancies (exposure to freezing). To model the evolution of species' traits and climate occupancies, we combined these data with an unparalleled dated molecular phylogeny (32,223 species) for land plants. Here we show that woody clades successfully moved into freezing-prone environments by either possessing transport networks of small safe conduits(5) and/or shutting down hydraulic function by dropping leaves during freezing. Herbaceous species largely avoided freezing periods by senescing cheaply constructed aboveground tissue. Growth habit has long been considered labile(6), but we find that growth habit was less labile than climate occupancy. Additionally, freezing environments were largely filled by lineages that had already become herbs or, when remaining woody, already had small conduits (that is, the trait evolved before the climate occupancy). By contrast, most deciduous woody lineages had an evolutionary shift to seasonally shedding their leaves only after exposure to freezing (that is, the climate occupancy evolved before the trait). For angiosperms to inhabit novel cold environments they had to gain new structural and functional trait solutions; our results suggest that many of these solutions were probably acquired before their foray into the cold.","[Zanne, Amy E.] George Washington Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Washington, DC 20052 USA; [Zanne, Amy E.] Missouri Bot Garden, Ctr Conservat & Sustainable Dev, St Louis, MO 63121 USA; [Tank, David C.; Eastman, Jonathan M.] Univ Idaho, Dept Biol Sci, Moscow, ID 83844 USA; [Tank, David C.; Eastman, Jonathan M.] Univ Idaho, Inst Bioinformat & Evolutionary Studies, Moscow, ID 83844 USA; [Cornwell, William K.] Dept Ecol Sci, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Cornwell, William K.; Moles, Angela T.; Hemmings, Frank; Warman, Laura] Univ New S Wales, Evolut & Ecol Res Ctr, Sch Biol Earth & Environm Sci, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia; [Smith, Stephen A.] Univ Michigan, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [FitzJohn, Richard G.] Univ British Columbia, Dept Zool, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada; [FitzJohn, Richard G.] Univ British Columbia, Biodivers Res Ctr, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada; [FitzJohn, Richard G.; Westoby, Mark; Wright, Ian J.; Leishman, Michelle R.] Macquarie Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Sydney, NSW 2109, Australia; [McGlinn, Daniel J.] Utah State Univ, Dept Biol, Logan, UT 84322 USA; [McGlinn, Daniel J.] Utah State Univ, Ctr Ecol, Logan, UT 84322 USA; [O'Meara, Brian C.] Univ Tennessee, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA; [Reich, Peter B.; Oleksyn, Jacek] Univ Minnesota, Dept Forest Resources, St Paul, MN 55108 USA; [Reich, Peter B.] Univ Western Sydney, Hawkesbury Inst Environm, Penrith, NSW 2751, Australia; [Royer, Dana L.] Wesleyan Univ, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, Middletown, CT 06459 USA; [Soltis, Douglas E.; Calaminus, Andre] Univ Florida, Dept Biol, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [Soltis, Douglas E.; Soltis, Pamela S.] Univ Florida, Florida Museum Nat Hist, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [Soltis, Douglas E.; Soltis, Pamela S.] Univ Florida, Genet Inst, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [Stevens, Peter F.] Univ Missouri, Dept Biol, St Louis, MO 63121 USA; [Aarssen, Lonnie] Queens Univ, Dept Biol, Kingston, ON K7L 3N6, Canada; [Bertin, Robert I.] Coll Holy Cross, Dept Biol, Worcester, MA 01610 USA; [Govaerts, Rafael] Royal Bot Gardens, Richmond TW9 3AB, Surrey, England; [Oleksyn, Jacek] Polish Acad Sci, Inst Dendrol, PL-62035 Kornik, Poland; [Swenson, Nathan G.] Michigan State Univ, Dept Plant Biol & Ecol, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Warman, Laura] US Forest Serv, Inst Pacific Isl Forestry, USDA, Hilo, HI 96720 USA; [Beaulieu, Jeremy M.] Univ Tennessee, Natl Inst Math & Biol Synth, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA","Zanne, AE (reprint author), George Washington Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Washington, DC 20052 USA.",aezanne@gmail.com,"; Leishman, Michelle/G-9726-2012; Wright, Ian/G-4979-2012; Warman, Laura/C-6651-2011; Oleksyn, Jacek/I-4539-2012; Soltis, Pamela/L-5184-2015; Moles, Angela/C-3083-2008","Ordonez, Alejandro/0000-0003-2873-4551; O'Meara, Brian/0000-0002-0337-5997; Leishman, Michelle/0000-0003-4830-5797; Wright, Ian/0000-0001-8338-9143; Warman, Laura/0000-0001-7339-749X; Moles, Angela/0000-0003-2041-7762; Cornwell, Will/0000-0003-4080-4073; Royer, Dana/0000-0003-0976-953X; Westoby, Mark/0000-0001-7690-4530; Smith, Stephen/0000-0003-2035-9531","National Evolutionary Synthesis Center (NESCent), National Science Foundation [EF- 0905606]; Macquarie University Genes to Geoscience Research Centre","We thank T.

Peer review acts as the gatekeeper to these mechanisms. Given the increasing concern surrounding the reproducibility of much published research(1), it is critical to understand whether peer review is intrinsically susceptible to failure, or whether other extrinsic factors are responsible that distort scientists' decisions. Here we show that even when scientists are motivated to promote the truth, their behaviour may be influenced, and even dominated, by information gleaned from their peers' behaviour, rather than by their personal dispositions. This phenomenon, known as herding, subjects the scientific community to an inherent risk of converging on an incorrect answer and raises the possibility that, under certain conditions, science may not be self-correcting. We further demonstrate that exercising some subjectivity in reviewer decisions, which serves to curb the herding process, can be beneficial for the scientific community in processing available information to estimate truth more accurately. By examining the impact of different models of reviewer decisions on the dynamic process of publication, and thereby on eventual aggregation of knowledge, we provide a new perspective on the ongoing discussion of how the peer-review process may be improved.","[Park, In-Uck; Peacey, Mike W.] Univ Bristol, Dept Econ, Bristol BS8 1TN, Avon, England; [Park, In-Uck] Sungkyunkwan Univ, Dept Econ, Seoul 110745, South Korea; [Peacey, Mike W.] Univ Bath, Dept Econ, Bath BA2 7AY, Avon, England; [Munafo, Marcus R.] Univ Bristol, MRC Integrat Epidemiol Unit IEU, Bristol BS8 1BN, Avon, England; [Munafo, Marcus R.] Univ Bristol, UK Ctr Tobacco & Alcohol Studies, Bristol BS8 1TU, Avon, England; [Munafo, Marcus R.] Univ Bristol, Sch Expt Psychol, Bristol BS8 1TU, Avon, England","Munafo, MR (reprint author), Univ Bristol, MRC Integrat Epidemiol Unit IEU, Bristol BS8 1BN, Avon, England.",marcus.munafo@bristol.ac.uk,,"Munafo, Marcus/0000-0002-4049-993X",Economics and Social Research Council UK; British Heart Foundation; Cancer Research UK; Economic and Social Research Council; Medical Research Council; National Institute for Health Research under the UK Clinical Research Collaboration,"This research was supported by an Economics and Social Research Council UK PhD studentship to M.W.P.

Here we analysed 9.2 million single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in each of 8,214 Mexicans and other Latin Americans: 3,848 with type 2 diabetes and 4,366 non-diabetic controls. In addition to replicating previous findings(2-4), we identified a novel locus associated with type 2 diabetes at genome-wide significance spanning the solute carriers SLC16A11 and SLC16A13 (P=3.9x10(-13); odds ratio (OR) = 1.29). The association was stronger in younger, leaner people with type 2 diabetes, and replicated in independent samples (P=1.1x10(-4); OR = 1.20). The risk haplotype carries four amino acid substitutions, all in SLC16A11; it is present at similar to 50% frequency in Native American samples and similar to 10% in east Asian, but is rare in European and African samples. Analysis of an archaic genome sequence indicated that the risk haplotype introgressed into modern humans via admixture with Neanderthals. The SLC16A11 messenger RNA is expressed in liver, and V5-tagged SLC16A11 protein localizes to the endoplasmic reticulum. Expression of SLC16A11 in heterologous cells alters lipid metabolism, most notably causing an increase in intracellular triacylglycerol levels. Despite type 2 diabetes having been well studied by genome-wide association studies in other populations, analysis in Mexican and Latin American individuals identified SLC16A11 as a novel candidate gene for type 2 diabetes with a possible role in triacylglycerol metabolism.","[Williams, Amy L.; Jacobs, Suzanne B.

Crystal structures of the inactive channel show that the SecY subunit of the heterotrimeric complex consists of two halves that form an hourglass-shaped pore with a constriction in the middle of the membrane and a lateral gate that faces the lipid phase(3-5). The closed channel has an empty cytoplasmic funnel and an extracellular funnel that is filled with a small helical domain, called the plug. During initiation of translocation, a ribosome-nascent chain complex binds to the SecY (or Sec61) complex, resulting in insertion of the nascent chain. However, the mechanism of channel opening during translocation is unclear. Here we have addressed this question by determining structures of inactive and active ribosome-channel complexes with cryo-electron microscopy. Non-translating ribosome-SecY channel complexes derived from Methanocaldococcus jannaschii or Escherichia coli show the channel in its closed state, and indicate that ribosome binding per se causes only minor changes. The structure of an active E. coli ribosome-channel complex demonstrates that the nascent chain opens the channel, causing mostly rigid body movements of the amino- and carboxy-terminal halves of SecY. In this early translocation intermediate, the polypeptide inserts as a loop into the SecY channel with the hydrophobic signal sequence intercalated into the open lateral gate. The nascent chain also forms a loop on the cytoplasmic surface of SecY rather than entering the channel directly.","[Park, Eunyong; Li, Weikai; Whynot, Andrew; Rapoport, Tom A.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Cell Biol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Park, Eunyong; Li, Weikai; Whynot, Andrew; Rapoport, Tom A.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Menetret, Jean-Francois; Akey, Christopher W.] Boston Univ, Sch Med, Dept Physiol & Biophys, Boston, MA 02118 USA; [Gumbart, James C.] Georgia Inst Technol, Sch Phys, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA; [Ludtke, Steven J.] Baylor Coll Med, Natl Ctr Macromol Imaging, Verna & Marrs McLean Dept Biochem & Mol Biol, Houston, TX 77030 USA","Rapoport, TA (reprint author), Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Cell Biol, 240 Longwood Ave, Boston, MA 02115 USA.",Tom_Rapoport@hms.harvard.edu; cakey@bu.edu,,,"National Institutes of Health [GM067887, GM080139, GM052586, GM45377]","We thank K.

In eukaryotic cells the PCC is located in the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum where it can bind to translating ribosomes for co-translational protein transport. The Sec complex consists of three subunits (Sec61 alpha, beta and gamma) and provides an aqueous environment for the translocation of hydrophilic peptides as well as a lateral opening in the Sec61a subunit that has been proposed to act as a gate for the membrane partitioning of hydrophobic domains(2). A plug helix and a so-called pore ring are believed to seal the PCC against ion flow and are proposed to rearrange for accommodation of translocating peptides(2,3). Several crystal and cryo-electron microscopy structures revealed different conformations of closed and partially open Sec61 and SecY complexes(2,4-8). However, in none of these samples has the translocation state been unambiguously defined biochemically. Here we present cryo-electron microscopy structures of ribosome-bound Sec61 complexes engaged in translocation or membrane insertion of nascent peptides. Our data show that a hydrophilic peptide can translocate through the Sec complex with an essentially closed lateral gate and an only slightly rearranged central channel. Membrane insertion of a hydrophobic domain seems to occur with the Sec complex opening the proposed lateral gate while rearranging the plug to maintain an ion permeability barrier. Taken together, we provide a structural model for the basic activities of the Sec61 complex as a protein-conducting channel.","[Gogala, Marko; Becker, Thomas; Beatrix, Birgitta; Armache, Jean-Paul; Barrio-Garcia, Clara; Berninghausen, Otto; Beckmann, Roland] Univ Munich, Gene Ctr, D-81377 Munich, Germany; [Gogala, Marko; Becker, Thomas; Beatrix, Birgitta; Armache, Jean-Paul; Barrio-Garcia, Clara; Berninghausen, Otto; Beckmann, Roland] Univ Munich, Dept Biochem, Ctr integrated Prot Sci Munich, D-81377 Munich, Germany","Beckmann, R (reprint author), Univ Munich, Gene Ctr, Feodor Lynen Str 25, D-81377 Munich, Germany.",beckmann@lmb.uni-muenchen.de,,,"German Research Council [SFB594, SFB646, GRK1721]; Center for Integrated Protein Science; European Research Council","We thank C.

Paradoxically, when DNA ligases encounter nicked DNA structures with abnormal DNA termini, DNA ligase catalytic activity can generate and/or exacerbate DNA damage through abortive ligation that produces chemically adducted, toxic 5'-adenylated (5'-AMP) DNA lesions(3-6). Aprataxin (APTX) reverses DNA adenylation but the context for deadenylation repair is unclear. Here we examine the importance of APTX to RNase-H2-dependent excision repair (RER) of a lesion that is very frequently introduced into DNA, a ribonucleotide. We show that ligases generate adenylated 5' ends containing a ribose characteristic of RNase H2 incision. APTX efficiently repairs adenylated RNA-DNA, and acting in an RNA-DNA damage response (RDDR), promotes cellular survival and prevents S-phase checkpoint activation in budding yeast undergoing RER. Structure-function studies of human APTX-RNA-DNA-AMP-Zn complexes define a mechanism for detecting and reversing adenylation at RNA-DNA junctions. This involves A-form RNA binding, proper protein folding and conformational changes, all of which are affected by heritable APTX mutations in ataxia with oculomotor apraxia 1. Together, these results indicate that accumulation of adenylated RNA-DNA may contribute to neurological disease.","[Tumbale, Percy; Williams, Jessica S.; Schellenberg, Matthew J.; Kunkel, Thomas A.; Williams, R.

The U6 snRNP contains a unique heptameric Lsm protein complex, which specifically recognizes the U6 small nuclear RNA at its 3' end. Here we report the crystal structures of the heptameric Lsm complex, both by itself and in complex with a 3' fragment of U6 snRNA, at 2.8 angstrom resolution. Each of the seven Lsm proteins interacts with two neighbouring Lsm components to form a doughnut-shaped assembly, with the order Lsm3-2-8-4-7-5-6. The four uridine nucleotides at the 3' end of U6 snRNA are modularly recognized by Lsm3, Lsm2, Lsm8 and Lsm4, with the uracil base specificity conferred by a highly conserved asparagine residue. The uracil base at the extreme 3' end is sandwiched by His 36 and Arg 69 from Lsm3, through pi-pi and cation-pi interactions, respectively. The distinctive end-recognition of U6 snRNA by the Lsm complex contrasts with RNA binding by the Sm complex in the other snRNPs. The structural features and associated biochemical analyses deepen mechanistic understanding of the U6 snRNP function in pre-mRNA splicing.","[Zhou, Lijun; Zhou, Yulin; Shi, Yigong] Tsinghua Univ, Minist Educ, Key Lab Prot Sci, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China; [Zhou, Lijun; Hang, Jing; Yin, Ping; Yan, Chuangye; Shi, Yigong] Tsinghua Univ, Sch Life Sci, Struct Biol Ctr, Tsinghua Peking Joint Ctr Life Sci, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China; [Zhou, Lijun; Hang, Jing; Yin, Ping; Yan, Chuangye; Shi, Yigong] Tsinghua Univ, Sch Med, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China; [Hang, Jing; Wan, Ruixue; Lu, Guifeng; Yan, Chuangye] Tsinghua Univ, State Key Lab Biomembrane & Membrane Biotechnol, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China","Shi, YG (reprint author), Tsinghua Univ, Minist Educ, Key Lab Prot Sci, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China.",shi-lab@tsinghua.edu.cn,,"Zhou, Lijun/0000-0002-0393-4787","National Natural Science Foundation of China [31130002, 31021002]","We thank S.

The evolutionary history of lncRNAs can provide insights into their functionality, but the absence of lncRNA annotations in non-model organisms has precluded comparative analyses. Here we present a large-scale evolutionary study of lncRNA repertoires and expression patterns, in 11 tetrapod species. We identify approximately 11,000 primate-specific lncRNAs and 2,500 highly conserved lncRNAs, including approximately 400 genes that are likely to have originated more than 300 million years ago. We find that lncRNAs, in particular ancient ones, are in general actively regulated and may function predominantly in embryonic development. Most lncRNAs evolve rapidly in terms of sequence and expression levels, but tissue specificities are often conserved. We compared expression patterns of homologous lncRNA and protein-coding families across tetrapods to reconstruct an evolutionarily conserved co-expression network. This network suggests potential functions for lncRNAs in fundamental processes such as spermatogenesis and synaptic transmission, but also in more specific mechanisms such as placenta development through microRNA production.","[Necsulea, Anamaria; Soumillon, Magali; Warnefors, Maria; Liechti, Angelica; Kaessmann, Henrik] Univ Lausanne, Ctr Integrat Genom, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland; [Necsulea, Anamaria; Soumillon, Magali; Warnefors, Maria; Liechti, Angelica; Kaessmann, Henrik] Swiss Inst Bioinformat, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland; [Daish, Tasman; Gruetzner, Frank] Univ Adelaide, Sch Mol & Biomed Sci, Robinson Inst, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia; [Zeller, Ulrich] Humboldt Univ, Fac Agr & Hort, Dept Systemat Zool, D-10099 Berlin, Germany; [Baker, Julie C.] Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Dept Genet, Stanford, CA 94305 USA","Necsulea, A (reprint author), Ecole Polytech Fed Lausanne, Lab Dev Genom, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland.",anamaria.necsulea@epfl.ch; henrik.kaessmann@unil.ch,"Kaessmann, Henrik/B-4989-2013","Grutzner, Frank/0000-0002-3088-7314",MRC/Wellcome Trust [099175/Z/12/Z]; European Research Council [242597]; Swiss National Science Foundation [31003A_130287]; FEBS,"We thank L.

In STAP, strong external stimuli such as a transient low-pH stressor reprogrammed mammalian somatic cells, resulting in the generation of pluripotent cells. Through real-time imaging of STAP cells derived from purified lymphocytes, as well as gene rearrangement analysis, we found that committed somatic cells give rise to STAP cells by reprogramming rather than selection. STAP cells showed a substantial decrease in DNA methylation in the regulatory regions of pluripotency marker genes. Blastocyst injection showed that STAP cells efficiently contribute to chimaeric embryos and to offspring via germline transmission. We also demonstrate the derivation of robustly expandable pluripotent cell lines from STAP cells. Thus, our findings indicate that epigenetic fate determination of mammalian cells can be markedly converted in a context-dependent manner by strong environmental cues.","[Obokata, Haruko; Kojima, Koji; Vacanti, Martin P.; Vacanti, Charles A.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Brigham & Womens Hosp, Lab Tissue Engn & Regenerat Med, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Obokata, Haruko] RIKEN Ctr Dev Biol, Lab Cellular Reprogramming, Kobe, Hyogo 6500047, Japan; [Obokata, Haruko; Wakayama, Teruhiko] RIKEN Ctr Dev Biol, Lab Genom Reprogramming, Kobe, Hyogo 6500047, Japan; [Sasai, Yoshiki] RIKEN Ctr Dev Biol, Lab Organogenesis & Neurogenesis, Kobe, Hyogo 6500047, Japan; [Vacanti, Martin P.] Irwin Army Community Hosp, Dept Pathol, Ft Riley, KS 66442 USA; [Niwa, Hitoshi] RIKEN Ctr Dev Biol, Lab Pluripotent Stem Cell Studies, Kobe, Hyogo 6500047, Japan; [Yamato, Masayuki] Tokyo Womens Med Univ, Inst Adv Biomed Engn & Sci, Tokyo 1628666, Japan","Obokata, H (reprint author), Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Brigham & Womens Hosp, Lab Tissue Engn & Regenerat Med, Boston, MA 02115 USA.",obokata@cdb.riken.jp; cvacanti@partners.org,,,"RIKEN; Network Project for Realization of Regenerative Medicine; Department of Anesthesiology, Perioperative and Pain Medicine at Brigham and Women's Hospital;  [20062015]","We thank S.

However, the metazoan chaperones responsible for H2A.Z deposition and its removal from chromatin remain unknown. Here we report the identification and characterization of the human protein ANP32E as a specific H2A.Z chaperone. We show that ANP32E is a member of the presumed H2A.Z histone-exchange complex p400/TIP60. ANP32E interacts with a short region of the docking domain of H2A.Z through a new motif termed H2A.Z interacting domain (ZID). The 1.48 angstrom resolution crystal structure of the complex formed between the ANP32E-ZID and the H2A.Z/H2B dimer and biochemical data support an underlying molecular mechanism for H2A.Z/H2B eviction from the nucleosome and its stabilization by ANP32E through a specific extension of the H2A.Z carboxy-terminal alpha-helix. Finally, analysis of H2A.Z localization in ANP32E(-/-) cells by chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing shows genome-wide enrichment, redistribution and accumulation of H2A.Z at specific chromatin control regions, in particular at enhancers and insulators.","[Obri, Arnaud; Ouararhni, Khalid; Papin, Christophe; Stoll, Isabelle; Roy, Ludovic; Hamiche, Ali] Univ Strasbourg, CNRS, INSERM, Dept Genom Fonct & Canc,IGBMC, F-67404 Illkirch Graffenstaden, France; [Diebold, Marie-Laure; Marek, Martin; Romier, Christophe] Univ Strasbourg, CNRS, INSERM, Dept Biol Struct Integrat,IGBMC, F-67404 Illkirch Graffenstaden, France; [Padmanabhan, Kiran; Dimitrov, Stefan] Univ Grenoble 1, INSERM, U823, Equipe Labelisee Ligue Canc,Inst Albert Bonniot, F-38042 Grenoble 9, France; [Reilly, Patrick T.; Mak, Tak W.] Natl Canc Ctr, Div Cellular & Mol Res, Lab Inflammat Biol, Singapore, Singapore; [Mak, Tak W.] Univ Hlth Network, Campbell Family Inst Breast Canc Res, Toronto, ON, Canada","Hamiche, A (reprint author), Univ Strasbourg, CNRS, INSERM, Dept Genom Fonct & Canc,IGBMC, 1 Rue Laurent Fries,bp 10142, F-67404 Illkirch Graffenstaden, France.",dimitrov@ujf-grenoble.fr; romier@igbmc.fr; hamiche@igbmc.fr,"dimitrov, stefan/M-7697-2013; Padmanabhan, Kiran/N-2953-2013; Marek, Martin/P-5702-2016; Marek, Martin/N-3204-2017","Padmanabhan, Kiran/0000-0001-7020-1682; Marek, Martin/0000-0003-0394-7382; Marek, Martin/0000-0001-7220-5644; Romier, Christophe/0000-0002-3680-935X; Roy, Ludovic/0000-0001-6940-874X; Obri, Arnaud/0000-0002-0779-1082; Papin, Christophe/0000-0001-8124-5883","CNRS; INSERM; Universite de Strasbourg; INCa [INCa_4496, INCa_4454]; ANR (VariZome) [ANR-12-BSV8-0018-01]; ANR (Nucleoplat) [NT09_476241]; Association pour la Recherche sur le Cancer; La Fondation pour la Recherche Medicale; La Ligue Nationale contre le Cancer (Equipe labellisee); French Infrastructure for Integrated Structural Biology (FRISBI) [ANR-10-INSB-05-01]; Instruct (ESFRI); Ligue Nationale contre le Cancer","We thank I.

As they cool below about 2,300 kelvin, liquid or crystalline particles composed of calcium aluminates, silicates and iron condense into atmospheric 'dust'(3,4), which disappears at still cooler temperatures (around 1,300 kelvin)(5,6). Models to explain this dust dispersal include both an abrupt sinking of the entire cloud deck into the deep, unobservable atmosphere(5,7) and breakup of the cloud into scattered patches(6,8) (as seen on Jupiter and Saturn(9)). However, hitherto observations of brown dwarfs have been limited to globally integrated measurements(10), which can reveal surface inhomogeneities but cannot unambiguously resolve surface features(11). Here we report a two-dimensional map of a brown dwarf's surface that allows identification of large-scale bright and dark features, indicative of patchy clouds.

Numerous theoretical investigations and hitherto unsuccessful experimental searches(2) have followed Dirac's 1931 development of a theory of monopoles consistent with both quantum mechanics and the gauge invariance of the electromagnetic field(3). The existence of even a single Dirac magnetic monopole would have far-reaching physical consequences, most famously explaining the quantization of electric charge(3,4). Although analogues of magnetic monopoles have been found in exotic spin ices(5,6) and other systems(7-9), there has been no direct experimental observation of Dirac monopoles within a medium described by a quantum field, such as superfluid helium-3 (refs 10-13). Here we demonstrate the controlled creation(14) of Dirac monopoles in the synthetic magnetic field produced by a spinor Bose-Einstein condensate. Monopoles are identified, in both experiments and matching numerical simulations, at the termini of vortex lines within the condensate. By directly imaging such a vortex line, the presence of a monopole may be discerned from the experimental data alone. These real-space images provide conclusive and long-awaited experimental evidence of the existence of Dirac monopoles. Our result provides an unprecedented opportunity to observe and manipulate these quantum mechanical entities in a controlled environment.","[Ray, M. W.; Kandel, S.; Hall, D.

In weakly bound systems, intermolecular Coulombic decay(1) (ICD) enables very efficient relaxation of electronic excitation through transfer of the excess energy to neighbouring atoms or molecules that then lose an electron and become ionized(2-9). Here we propose that the emission site and energy of the electrons released during this process can be controlled by coupling the ICD to a resonant core excitation. We illustrate this concept with ab initio many body calculations on the argon-krypton model system, where resonant photoabsorption produces an initial or 'parent' excitation of the argon atom, which then triggers a resonant-Auger-ICD cascade that ends with the emission of a slow electron from the krypton atom. Our calculations show that the energy of the emitted electrons depends sensitively on the initial excited state of the argon atom. The incident energy can thus be adjusted both to produce the initial excitation in a chosen atom and to realize an excitation that will result in the emission of ICD electrons with desired energies. These properties of the decay cascade might have consequences for fundamental and applied radiation biology and could be of interest in the development of new spectroscopic techniques.","[Gokhberg, Kirill; Kuleff, Alexander I.; Cederbaum, Lorenz S.] Heidelberg Univ, Inst Phys Chem, D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany; [Kolorenc, Premysl] Charles Univ Prague, Fac Math & Phys, Inst Theoret Phys, CR-18000 Prague, Czech Republic","Gokhberg, K (reprint author), Heidelberg Univ, Inst Phys Chem, Neuenheimer Feld 229, D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany.",kirill.gokhberg@pci.uni-heidelberg.de; alexander.kuleff@pci.uni-heidelberg.de,"Kolorenc, Premysl/J-9097-2014; Kuleff, Alexander/P-2916-2017","Kolorenc, Premysl/0000-0002-0747-4546; Kuleff, Alexander/0000-0003-2583-4370",European Research Council under the European Community [227597]; Czech Science Foundation [P208/12/0521],The research leading to these results received funding from the European Research Council under the European Community's Seventh Framework Programme (FP7/2007-2013)/ERC Advanced Investigator Grant no. 227597.

This intermolecular Coulombic decay (ICD) process has since been shown to be a common phenomenon(2-12), raising questions about its role in DNA damage induced by ionizing radiation, in which low-energy electrons are known to play an important part(13,14). It was recently suggested(15) that ICD can be triggered efficiently and site-selectively by resonantly core-exciting a target atom, which then transforms through Auger decay into an ionic species with sufficiently high excitation energy to permit ICD to occur. Here we show experimentally that resonant Auger decay can indeed trigger ICD in dimers of both molecular nitrogen and carbon monoxide. By using ion and electron momentum spectroscopy to measure simultaneously the charged species created in the resonant-Auger-driven ICD cascade, we find that ICD occurs in less time than the 20 femtoseconds it would take for individual molecules to undergo dissociation. Our experimental confirmation of this process and its efficiency may trigger renewed efforts to develop resonant X-ray excitation schemes(16,17) for more localized and targeted cancer radiation therapy.","[Trinter, F.; Schoeffler, M.

Furthermore, controversy exists regarding the robustness of the observational record, especially before 1990(3-5). Here we show, on the basis of a new tropical cyclone activity index (CAI), that the present low levels of storm activity on the mid west and northeast coasts of Australia are unprecedented over the past 550 to 1,500 years. The CAI allows for a direct comparison between the modern instrumental record and long-term palaeotempest (prehistoric tropical cyclone) records derived from the O-18/O-16 ratio of seasonally accreting carbonate layers of actively growing stalagmites. Our results reveal a repeated multicentennial cycle of tropical cyclone activity, the most recent of which commenced around AD 1700. The present cycle includes a sharp decrease in activity after 1960 in Western Australia. This is in contrast to the increasing frequency and destructiveness of Northern Hemisphere tropical cyclones since 1970 in the Atlantic Ocean(6-8) and the western North Pacific Ocean(6,7). Other studies project a decrease in the frequency of tropical cyclones towards the end of the twenty-first century in the southwest Pacific(7,9), southern Indian(9,10) and Australian(11) regions. Our results, although based on a limited record, suggest that this may be occurring much earlier than expected.","[Haig, Jordahna; Nott, Jonathan] James Cook Univ, Cairns, Qld 4870, Australia; [Reichart, Gert-Jan] Univ Utrecht, Dept Geochem, NL-3508 TA Utrecht, Netherlands; [Reichart, Gert-Jan] Royal Netherlands Inst Sea Res, Dept Geol, NL-1797 SZ Den Hoorn, Texel, Netherlands","Haig, J (reprint author), James Cook Univ, Cairns, Qld 4870, Australia.",jordahna.haig@jcu.edu.au,"James Cook University, TESS/B-8171-2012; Nott, Jonathan/H-5156-2011","Nott, Jonathan/0000-0001-7258-017X",Australian Research Council (ARC) [DP0772691]; Queensland Smart State Initiative,Funding for this project was provided by the Australian Research Council (ARC) Discovery Projects Scheme (reference number DP0772691) and financial assistance given as part of the Queensland Smart State Initiative.

This is particularly relevant for intrasexual competition, which often leads to males harming females(2). Recent theory proposes that kin selection may modulate female harm by relaxing competition among male relatives(3-5). Here we experimentally manipulate the relatedness of groups of male Drosophila melanogaster competing over females to demonstrate that, as expected, within-group relatedness inhibits male competition and female harm. Females exposed to groups of three brothers unrelated to the female had higher lifetime reproductive success and slower reproductive ageing compared to females exposed to groups of three males unrelated to each other. Triplets of brothers also fought less with each other, courted females less intensively and lived longer than triplets of unrelated males. However, associations among brothers may be vulnerable to invasion by minorities of unrelated males: when two brothers were matched with an unrelated male, the unrelated male sired on average twice as many offspring as either brother. These results demonstrate that relatedness can profoundly affect fitness through its modulation of intrasexual competition, as flies plastically adjust sexual behaviour in a manner consistent with kin-selection theory.","[Carazo, Pau; Tan, Cedric K.

This reprogramming does not require nuclear transfer(2,3) or genetic manipulation(4). Here we report that reprogrammed STAP cells, unlike embryonic stem (ES) cells, can contribute to both embryonic and placental tissues, as seen in a blastocyst injection assay. Mouse STAP cells lose the ability to contribute to the placenta as well as trophoblast marker expression on converting into ES-like stem cells by treatment with adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF). In contrast, when cultured with Fgf4, STAP cells give rise to proliferative stem cells with enhanced trophoblastic characteristics. Notably, unlike conventional trophoblast stem cells, the Fgf4-induced stem cells from STAP cells contribute to both embryonic and placental tissues in vivo and transform into ES-like cells when cultured with LIF-containing medium. Taken together, the developmental potential of STAP cells, shown by chimaera formation and in vitro cell conversion, indicates that they represent a unique state of pluripotency.","[Obokata, Haruko; Terashita, Yukari] RIKEN Ctr Dev Biol, Lab Cellular Reprogramming, Kobe, Hyogo 6500047, Japan; [Obokata, Haruko; Tokoro, Mikiko; Terashita, Yukari; Wakayama, Teruhiko] RIKEN Ctr Dev Biol, Lab Genom Reprogramming, Kobe, Hyogo 6500047, Japan; [Obokata, Haruko; Vacanti, Charles A.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Brigham & Womens Hosp, Lab Tissue Engn & Regenerat Med, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Sasai, Yoshiki; Takata, Nozomu] RIKEN Ctr Dev Biol, Lab Organogenesis & Neurogenesis, Kobe, Hyogo 6500047, Japan; [Niwa, Hitoshi] RIKEN Ctr Dev Biol, Lab Pluripotent Stem Cell Studies, Kobe, Hyogo 6500047, Japan; [Kadota, Mitsutaka; Andrabi, Munazah] RIKEN Ctr Dev Biol, Genome Resource & Anal Unit, Kobe, Hyogo 6500047, Japan; [Yonemura, Shigenobu] RIKEN Ctr Dev Biol, Electron Microscopy Lab, Kobe, Hyogo 6500047, Japan; [Wakayama, Teruhiko] Univ Yamanashi, Fac Life & Environm Sci, Yamanashi 4008510, Japan","Obokata, H (reprint author), RIKEN Ctr Dev Biol, Lab Cellular Reprogramming, Kobe, Hyogo 6500047, Japan.",obokata@cdb.riken.jp; yoshikisasai@cdb.riken.jp; teru@cdb.riken.jp,,,"RIKEN; Network Project for Realization of Regenerative Medicine; Department of Anesthesiology, Perioperative and Pain Medicine at Brigham and Women's Hospital;  [20062015]","We thank S.

In mammalian blood, two developmental forms of the parasite exist: proliferative 'slender' forms and arrested 'stumpy' forms that are responsible for transmission to tsetse flies. The slender to stumpy differentiation is a density-dependent response that resembles quorum sensing in microbial systems and is crucial for the parasite life cycle, ensuring both infection chronicity and disease transmission(1). This response is triggered by an elusive 'stumpy induction factor' (SIF) whose intracellular signalling pathway is also uncharacterized. Laboratory-adapted (monomorphic) trypanosome strains respond inefficiently to SIF but can generate forms with stumpy characteristics when exposed to cell-permeable cAMP and AMP analogues. Exploiting this, we have used a genome-wide RNA interference library screen to identify the signalling components driving stumpy formation. In separate screens, monomorphic parasites were exposed to 8-(4-chlorophenylthio)-cAMP(pCPT-cAMP) or 8-pCPT-2'-O-methyl-5'-AMP to select cells that were unresponsive to these signals and hence remained proliferative. Genome-wide Ion Torrent based RNAi target sequencing identified cohorts of genes implicated in each step of the signalling pathway, from purine metabolism, through signal transducers (kinases, phosphatases) to gene expression regulators. Genes at each step were independently validated in cells naturally capable of stumpy formation, confirming their role in density sensing in vivo. The putative RNA-binding protein, RBP7, was required for normal quorum sensing and promoted cell-cycle arrest and transmission competence when overexpressed. This study reveals that quorum sensing signalling in trypanosomes shares similarities to fundamental quiescence pathways in eukaryotic cells, its components providing targets for quorum-sensing interference-based therapeutics.","[Mony, Binny M.; MacGregor, Paula; Ivens, Alasdair; Rojas, Federico; Cowton, Andrew; Young, Julie; Matthews, Keith] Univ Edinburgh, Sch Biol Sci, Inst Immunol & Infect Res, Ctr Immun Infect & Evolut, Edinburgh EH9 3JT, Midlothian, Scotland; [Horn, David] Univ Dundee, Coll Life Sci, Dundee DD1 5EH, Scotland","Matthews, K (reprint author), Univ Edinburgh, Sch Biol Sci, Inst Immunol & Infect Res, Ctr Immun Infect & Evolut, Edinburgh EH9 3JT, Midlothian, Scotland.",keith.matthews@ed.ac.uk,,"Horn, David/0000-0001-5173-9284; MacGregor, Paula/0000-0003-0919-3745","Wellcome Trust [088293MA, 095831MA, 100320/Z/12/Z]","This work was funded by a Wellcome Trust Programme grant (088293MA) to K.M. and by a Wellcome Trust strategic award (095831MA) to the Centre for Immunity, Infection and Evolution.

It is thought that diversity and genetic structure of viral populations determine the rapid adaptation observed in RNA viruses(2) and hence their pathogenesis(3). However, our understanding of the mechanisms underlying virus evolution has been limited by the inability to accurately describe the genetic structure of virus populations. Next-generation sequencing technologies generate data of sufficient depth to characterize virus populations, but are limited in their utility because most variants are present at very low frequencies and are thus indistinguishable from next-generation sequencing errors. Here we present an approach that reduces next-generation sequencing errors and allows the description of virus populations with unprecedented accuracy. Using this approach, we define the mutation rates of poliovirus and uncover the mutation landscape of the population. Furthermore, by monitoring changes in variant frequencies on serially passaged populations, we determined fitness values for thousands of mutations across the viral genome. Mapping of these fitness values onto three-dimensional structures of viral proteins offers a powerful approach for exploring structure-function relationships and potentially uncovering new functions. To our knowledge, our study provides the first single-nucleotide fitness landscape of an evolving RNA virus and establishes a general experimental platform for studying the genetic changes underlying the evolution of virus populations.","[Acevedo, Ashley; Andino, Raul] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Microbiol & Immunol, San Francisco, CA 94122 USA; [Brodsky, Leonid] Univ Haifa, Tauber Bioinformat Res Ctr, IL-31905 Haifa, Israel; [Brodsky, Leonid] Univ Haifa, Dept Evolutionary & Environm Biol, IL-31905 Haifa, Israel","Andino, R (reprint author), Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Microbiol & Immunol, San Francisco, CA 94122 USA.",raul.andino@ucsf.edu,,,"National Science Foundation; NIAID [AI091575, AI36178, AI40085]; DARPA Prophecy","We thank J.

However, a lack of genome-wide in vivo RNA structural data has limited our understanding of how RNA structure regulates gene expression in living cells. Here we present a high-throughput, genome-wide in vivo RNA structure probing method, structure-seq, in which dimethyl sulphate methylation of unprotected adenines and cytosines is identified by next-generation sequencing. Application of this method to Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings yielded the first in vivo genome-wide RNA structure map at nucleotide resolution for any organism, with quantitative structural information across more than 10,000 transcripts. Our analysis reveals a three-nucleotide periodic repeat pattern in the structure of coding regions, as well as a less-structured region immediately upstream of the start codon, and shows that these features are strongly correlated with translation efficiency. We also find patterns of strong and weak secondary structure at sites of alternative polyadenylation, as well as strong secondary structure at 59 splice sites that correlates with unspliced events. Notably, in vivo structures of messenger RNAs annotated for stress responses are poorly predicted in silico, whereas mRNA structures of genes related to cell function maintenance are well predicted. Global comparison of several structural features between these two categories shows that the mRNAs associated with stress responses tend to have more single-strandedness, longer maximal loop length and higher free energy per nucleotide, features that may allow these RNAs to undergo conformational changes in response to environmental conditions. Structure-seq allows the RNA structurome and its biological roles to be interrogated on a genome-wide scale and should be applicable to any organism.","[Ding, Yiliang; Tang, Yin; Assmann, Sarah M.] Penn State Univ, Dept Biol, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Ding, Yiliang; Kwok, Chun Kit; Bevilacqua, Philip C.] Penn State Univ, Dept Chem, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Ding, Yiliang; Tang, Yin; Kwok, Chun Kit; Bevilacqua, Philip C.; Assmann, Sarah M.] Penn State Univ, Ctr RNA Mol Biol, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Tang, Yin; Zhang, Yu; Assmann, Sarah M.] Penn State Univ, Bioinformat & Genom Grad Program, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Zhang, Yu] Penn State Univ, Dept Stat, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Bevilacqua, Philip C.; Assmann, Sarah M.] Penn State Univ, Plant Biol Grad Program, University Pk, PA 16802 USA","Assmann, SM (reprint author), Penn State Univ, Dept Biol, University Pk, PA 16802 USA.",pcb5@psu.edu; sma3@psu.edu,,"KWOK, Chun Kit/0000-0001-9175-8543; Bevilacqua, Philip/0000-0001-8074-3434",Human Frontier Science Program (HFSP) [RGP0002/2009-C]; Penn State Eberly College of Science; Penn State Huck Institutes HITS; National Science Foundation [OCI-0821527],"This research is supported by Human Frontier Science Program (HFSP) grant RGP0002/2009-C, the Penn State Eberly College of Science, and a Penn State Huck Institutes HITS grant to P.C.B. and S.M.A. We thank F.

The latter function is enabled by RNA's ability to adopt complex secondary and tertiary folds and thus has motivated extensive computational(1,2) and experimental(3-8) efforts for determining RNA structures. Existing approaches for evaluating RNA structure have been largely limited to in vitro systems, yet the thermodynamic forces which drive RNA folding in vitro may not be sufficient to predict stable RNA structures in vivo(5). Indeed, the presence of RNA-binding proteins and ATP-dependent helicases can influence which structures are present inside cells. Here we present an approach for globally monitoring RNA structure in native conditions in vivo with single-nucleotide precision. This method is based on in vivo modification with dimethyl sulphate (DMS), which reacts with unpaired adenine and cytosine residues(9), followed by deep sequencing to monitor modifications. Our data from yeast and mammalian cells are in excellent agreement with known messenger RNA structures and with the high-resolution crystal structure of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae ribosome(10). Comparison between in vivo and in vitro data reveals that in rapidly dividing cells there are vastly fewer structured mRNA regions in vivo than in vitro. Even thermostable RNA structures are often denatured in cells, highlighting the importance of cellular processes in regulating RNA structure. Indeed, analysis of mRNA structure under ATP-depleted conditions in yeast shows that energy-dependent processes strongly contribute to the predominantly unfolded state of mRNAs inside cells. Our studies broadly enable the functional analysis of physiological RNA structures and reveal that, in contrast to the Anfinsen view of protein folding whereby the structure formed is the most thermodynamically favourable, thermodynamics have an incomplete role in determining mRNA structure in vivo.","[Rouskin, Silvi; Zubradt, Meghan; Weissman, Jonathan S.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Dept Cellular & Mol Pharmacol, Calif Inst Quantitat Biol,Ctr RNA Syst Biol, San Francisco, CA 94158 USA; [Washietl, Stefan; Kellis, Manolis] MIT, Dept Elect Engn & Comp Sci, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Washietl, Stefan; Kellis, Manolis] MIT, Comp Sci & Artificial Intelligence Lab, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Washietl, Stefan; Kellis, Manolis] Broad Inst, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA","Weissman, JS (reprint author), Univ Calif San Francisco, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Dept Cellular & Mol Pharmacol, Calif Inst Quantitat Biol,Ctr RNA Syst Biol, San Francisco, CA 94158 USA.",weissman@cmp.ucsf.edu,,,Center for RNA Systems Biology; Howard Hughes Medical Institute; National Science Foundation,"We thank R.

RNA structure influences practically every step in the gene expression program(1). However, the nature of most RNA structures or effects of sequence variation on structure are not known. Here we report the initial landscape and variation of RNA secondary structures (RSSs) in a human family trio (mother, father and their child). This provides a comprehensive RSS map of human coding and non-coding RNAs. We identify unique RSS signatures that demarcate open reading frames and splicing junctions, and define authentic micro RNA-binding sites. Comparison of native deproteinized RNA isolated from cells versus refolded purified RNA suggests that the majority of the RSS information is encoded within RNA sequence. Over 1,900 transcribed single nucleotide variants (approximately 15% of all transcribed single nucleotide variants) alter local RNA structure. We discover simple sequence and spacing rules that determine the ability of point mutations to impact RSSs. Selective depletion of 'riboSNitches' versus structurally synonymous variants at precise locations suggests selection for specific RNA shapes at thousands of sites, including 3' untranslated regions, binding sites of microRNAs and RNA-binding proteins genome-wide. These results highlight the potentially broad contribution of RNA structure and its variation to gene regulation.","[Wan, Yue; Qu, Kun; Zhang, Qiangfeng Cliff; Flynn, Ryan A.; Ouyang, Zhengqing; Zhang, Jiajing; Spitale, Robert C.; Chang, Howard Y.] Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Wan, Yue; Qu, Kun; Zhang, Qiangfeng Cliff; Flynn, Ryan A.; Ouyang, Zhengqing; Zhang, Jiajing; Spitale, Robert C.; Chang, Howard Y.] Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Program Epithelial Biol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Wan, Yue] Genome Inst Singapore, Singapore 138672, Singapore; [Manor, Ohad; Segal, Eran] Weizmann Inst Sci, Dept Comp Sci & Appl Math, IL-76100 Rehovot, Israel; [Snyder, Michael P.] Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Dept Genet, Stanford, CA 94305 USA","Chang, HY (reprint author), Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",wany@gis.a-star.edu.sg; howchang@stanford.edu,"Zhang, Qiangfeng/C-2902-2011; Qu, Kun/G-3359-2012","Flynn, Ryan/0000-0001-5013-0442; Segal, Eran/0000-0002-6859-1164",NIH [R01-HG004361],"We thank members of the Chang laboratory, S.

Recent screening studies have begun to catalogue ISGs with antiviral activity against several RNA and DNA viruses(4-13). However, antiviral ISG specificity across multiple distinct classes of viruses remains largely unexplored. Here we used an ectopic expression assay to screen a library of more than 350 human ISGs for effects on 14 viruses representing 7 families and 11 genera. We show that 47 genes inhibit one or more viruses, and 25 genes enhance virus infectivity. Comparative analysis reveals that the screened ISGs target positive-sense single-stranded RNA viruses more effectively than negative-sense single-stranded RNA viruses. Gene clustering highlights the cytosolic DNA sensor cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS, also known as MB21D1) as a gene whose expression also broadly inhibits several RNA viruses. In vitro, lentiviral delivery of enzymatically active cGAS triggers a STING-dependent, IRF3-mediated antiviral program that functions independently of canonical IFN/STAT1 signalling.

To explore the feasibility of creating a comprehensive catalogue of cancer genes, we analysed somatic point mutations in exome sequences from 4,742 human cancers and their matched normal-tissue samples across 21 cancer types. We found that large-scale genomic analysis can identify nearly all known cancer genes in these tumour types. Our analysis also identified 33 genes that were not previously known to be significantly mutated in cancer, including genes related to proliferation, apoptosis, genome stability, chromatin regulation, immune evasion, RNA processing and protein homeostasis. Down-sampling analysis indicates that larger sample sizes will reveal many more genes mutated at clinically important frequencies. We estimate that near-saturation may be achieved with 6005,000 samples per tumour type, depending on background mutation frequency. The results may help to guide the next stage of cancer genomics.","[Lawrence, Michael S.; Stojanov, Petar; Mermel, Craig H.; Robinson, James T.; Garraway, Levi A.; Golub, Todd R.; Meyerson, Matthew; Gabriel, Stacey B.; Lander, Eric S.; Getz, Gad] Broad Inst MIT & Harvard, Cambridge Ctr 7, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; [Stojanov, Petar; Garraway, Levi A.; Golub, Todd R.; Meyerson, Matthew] Dana Farber Canc Inst, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Mermel, Craig H.; Getz, Gad] Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Ctr Canc, Boston, MA 02114 USA; [Mermel, Craig H.; Getz, Gad] Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Dept Pathol, Boston, MA 02114 USA; [Garraway, Levi A.; Golub, Todd R.; Meyerson, Matthew; Lander, Eric S.; Getz, Gad] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Golub, Todd R.] Howard Hughes Med Inst, Chevy Chase, MD 20815 USA; [Lander, Eric S.] MIT, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA","Lander, ES (reprint author), Broad Inst MIT & Harvard, Cambridge Ctr 7, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA.",lander@broadinstitute.org; gadgetz@broadinstitute.org,,"Meyerson, Matthew/0000-0002-9133-8108",Howard Hughes Medical Institute; NCI NIH HHS [R01 CA157304]; NHGRI NIH HHS [U54 HG003067]; NIGMS NIH HHS [T32 GM007753],,,13,871,885,15,191,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,23-Jan,2014,505,7484,,,,,495,+,,10.1038/nature12912,,9,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,293SW,WOS:000329995000029,24390350,No,Y,N,11/20/17

To address this question, we used a nonhuman primate challenge model with simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV). We show that antibodies to the SIV envelope are necessary and sufficient to prevent infection. Moreover, sequencing of viruses from breakthrough infections revealed selective pressure against neutralization-sensitive viruses; we identified a two-amino-acid signature that alters antigenicity and confers neutralization resistance. A similar signature confers resistance of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 to neutralization by monoclonal antibodies against variable regions 1 and 2 (V1V2), suggesting that SIV and HIV share a fundamental mechanism of immune escape from vaccine-elicited or naturally elicited antibodies. These analyses provide insight into the limited efficacy seen in HIV vaccine trials.","[Roederer, Mario; Schmidt, Stephen D.; Mason, Rosemarie D.; Welles, Hugh C.; Foulds, Kathryn E.; Louder, Mark K.; Yang, Zhi-Yong; Todd, John-Paul M.; Bailer, Robert T.; Seder, Robert A.; Koup, Richard A.; Rao, Srinivas S.; Nabel, Gary J.; Mascola, John R.] NIAID, Vaccine Res Ctr, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Keele, Brandon F.] NIH, SAIC Frederick, Frederick Natl Lab, Frederick, MD 21702 USA; [Welles, Hugh C.] George Washington Univ, Washington, DC 20052 USA; [Fischer, Will; Korber, Bette T.] Los Alamos Natl Labs, Los Alamos, NM 87545 USA; [Labranche, Celia; Ward, Brandy M.; Ferrari, Guido; Montefiori, David C.] Duke Univ, Dept Surg, Durham, NC 27710 USA; [Buzby, Adam P.; Mach, Linh V.; Shen, Ling; Letvin, Norman L.] Beth Israel Deaconess Med Ctr, Ctr Virol & Vaccine Res, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Seaton, Kelly E.; Alam, S.

We now show that caspase-3-mediated apoptosis accounts for the death of only a small fraction of CD4 T cells corresponding to those that are both activated and productively infected. The remaining over 95% of quiescent lymphoid CD4 T cells die by caspase-1-mediated pyroptosis triggered by abortive viral infection. Pyroptosis corresponds to an intensely inflammatory form of programmed cell death in which cytoplasmic contents and pro-inflammatory cytokines, including IL-1 beta, are released. This death pathway thus links the two signature events in HIV infection-CD4 T-cell depletion and chronic inflammation-and creates a pathogenic vicious cycle in which dying CD4 T cells release inflammatory signals that attract more cells to die. This cycle can be broken by caspase 1 inhibitors shown to be safe in humans, raising the possibility of a new class of 'anti-AIDS' therapeutics targeting the host rather than the virus.","[Doitsh, Gilad; Galloway, Nicole L.

They show complex orbital interactions, which can constrain the compositions, masses and interior structures of the bodies(5) and test theories of gravity(6), if sufficiently precise measurements are available. A triple system containing a radio pulsar could provide such measurements, but the only previously known such system, PSR B1620-26 (refs 7, 8; with a millisecond pulsar, a white dwarf, and a planetary-mass object in an orbit of several decades), shows only weak interactions. Here we report precision timing and multiwavelength observations of PSR J0337+1715, a millisecond pulsar in a hierarchical triple system with two other stars. Strong gravitational interactions are apparent and provide the masses of the pulsar (1.4378(13)M-circle dot, where M-circle dot is the solar mass and the parentheses contain the uncertainty in the final decimal places) and the two white dwarf companions (0.19751(15)M-circle dot and 0.4101(3)M-circle dot), as well as the inclinations of the orbits (both about 39.2 degrees). The unexpectedly coplanar and nearly circular orbits indicate a complex and exotic evolutionary past that differs from those of known stellar systems. The gravitational field of the outer white dwarf strongly accelerates the inner binary containing the neutron star, and the system will thus provide an ideal laboratory in which to test the strong equivalence principle of general relativity.","[Ransom, S.

Models suggest that some of the icy bodies may have migrated into the asteroid belt(1). Recent observations indicate the presence of water ice on the surface of some asteroids(2-4), with sublimation(5) a potential reason for the dust activity observed on others. Hydrated minerals have been found(6-8) on the surface of the largest object in the asteroid belt, the dwarf planet (1) Ceres, which is thought to be differentiated into a silicate core with an icy mantle(9-11). The presence of water vapour around Ceres was suggested by a marginal detection of the photodissociation product of water, hydroxyl (ref. 12), but could not be confirmed by later, more sensitive observations(13). Here we report the detection of water vapour around Ceres, with at least 10(26) molecules being produced per second, originating from localized sources that seem to be linked to mid-latitude regions on the surface(14,15). The water evaporation could be due to comet-like sublimation or to cryo-volcanism, in which volcanoes erupt volatiles such as water instead of molten rocks.","[Kueppers, Michael; O'Rourke, Laurence; Carry, Benoit; Teyssier, David; Marston, Anthony] European Space Agcy, European Space Astron Ctr, Villanueva De La Canada 28691, Spain; [Bockelee-Morvan, Dominique; Zakharov, Vladimir; Crovisier, Jacques; Barucci, M.

Recently, a new method has emerged with the recognition that symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases(1,2), which occur in systems with an energy gap to quasiparticle excitations (such as insulators or superconductors), can host robust surface states that remain gapless as long as the relevant global symmetry remains unbroken. The nature of the charge carriers in SPT surface states is intimately tied to the symmetry of the bulk, resulting in one- and two-dimensional electronic systems with novel properties. For example, time reversal symmetry endows the massless charge carriers on the surface of a three-dimensional topological insulator with helicity, fixing the orientation of their spin relative to their momentum(3,4). Weakly breaking this symmetry generates a gap on the surface(5), resulting in charge carriers with finite effective mass and exotic spin textures(6). Analogous manipulations have yet to be demonstrated in two-dimensional topological insulators, where the primary example of a SPT phase is the quantum spin Hall state(7,8). Here we demonstrate experimentally that charge-neutral monolayer graphene has a quantum spin Hall state(9,10) when it is subjected to a very large magnetic field angled with respect to the graphene plane. In contrast to time-reversal-symmetric systems(7), this state is protected by a symmetry of planar spin rotations that emerges as electron spins in a half-filled Landau level are polarized by the large magnetic field. The properties of the resulting helical edge states can be modulated by balancing the applied field against an intrinsic antiferromagnetic instability(11-13), which tends to spontaneously break the spin-rotation symmetry. In the resulting canted antiferromagnetic state, we observe transport signatures of gapped edge states, which constitute a new kind of one- dimensional electronic system with a tunable bandgap and an associated spin texture(14).","[Young, A.

Most importantly, dislocations are the main carriers of plastic deformation in crystalline materials(4-6). Furthermore, they can strongly affect the local electronic and optical properties of semiconductors and ionic crystals(7,8). In materials with small dimensions, they experience extensive image forces, which attract them to the surface to release strain energy(9). However, in layered crystals such as graphite, dislocation movement is mainly restricted to the basal plane. Thus, the dislocations cannot escape, enabling their confinement in crystals as thin as only two monolayers. To explore the nature of dislocations under such extreme boundary conditions, the material of choice is bilayer graphene, the thinnest possible quasi-two-dimensional crystal in which such linear defects can be confined. Homogeneous and robust graphene membranes derived from high-quality epitaxial graphene on silicon carbide(10) provide an ideal platform for their investigation. Here we report the direct observation of basal-plane dislocations in freestanding bilayer graphene using transmission electron microscopy and their detailed investigation by diffraction contrast analysis and atomistic simulations. Our investigation reveals two striking size effects. First, the absence of stacking-fault energy, a unique property of bilayer graphene, leads to a characteristic dislocation pattern that corresponds to an alternating AB <-> AC change of the stacking order. Second, our experiments in combination with atomistic simulations reveal a pronounced buckling of the bilayer graphene membrane that results directly from accommodation of strain. In fact, the buckling changes the strain state of the bilayer graphene and is of key importance for its electronic properties(11-14). Our findings will contribute to the understanding of dislocations and of their role in the structural, mechanical and electronic properties of bilayer and few-layer graphene.","[Butz, Benjamin; Dolle, Christian; Niekiel, Florian; Spiecker, Erdmann] Univ Erlangen Nurnberg, Ctr Nanoanal & Electron Microscopy, D-91058 Erlangen, Germany; [Weber, Konstantin; Meyer, Bernd] Univ Erlangen Nurnberg, Interdisziplinares Zentrum Mol Mat, D-91052 Erlangen, Germany; [Weber, Konstantin; Meyer, Bernd] Univ Erlangen Nurnberg, Comp Chem Ctr, D-91052 Erlangen, Germany; [Waldmann, Daniel; Weber, Heiko B.] Univ Erlangen Nurnberg, Lehrstuhl Angew Phys, D-91058 Erlangen, Germany","Butz, B (reprint author), Univ Erlangen Nurnberg, Ctr Nanoanal & Electron Microscopy, Cauerstr 6, D-91058 Erlangen, Germany.",benjamin.butz@ww.uni-erlangen.de; erdmann.spiecker@ww.uni-erlangen.de,"Butz, Benjamin/A-3937-2013; Albe, Karsten/F-1139-2011; Spiecker, Erdmann/B-3902-2017; Weber, Heiko/D-2654-2012","Butz, Benjamin/0000-0002-9744-3419; Weber, Heiko/0000-0002-6403-9022",Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft [SFB 953]; Cluster of Excellence EXC 315 'Engineering of Advanced Materials' at the Friedrich-Alexander-Universitat Erlangen-Nurnberg,"We acknowledge use of experimental equipment of P.

The Antarctic Peninsula exhibited the strongest warming(1,2) of any region on the planet, causing rapid changes in land ice(3,4). Additionally, in contrast to the sea-ice decline over the Arctic, Antarctic sea ice has not declined, but has instead undergone a perplexing redistribution(5,6). Antarctic climate is influenced by, among other factors, changes in radiative forcing(7) and remote Pacific climate variability(8,9), but none explains the observed Antarctic Peninsula warming or the sea-ice redistribution in austral winter. However, in the north and tropical Atlantic Ocean, the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation(10,11) (a leading mode of sea surface temperature variability) has been overlooked in this context. Here we show that sea surface warming related to the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation reduces the surface pressure in the Amundsen Sea and contributes to the observed dipole-like sea-ice redistribution between the Ross and Amundsen-Bellingshausen-Weddell seas and to the Antarctic Peninsula warming. Support for these findings comes from analysis of observational and reanalysis data, and independently from both comprehensive and idealized atmospheric model simulations. We suggest that the north and tropical Atlantic is important for projections of future climate change in Antarctica, and has the potential to affect the global thermohaline circulation(6) and sea-level change(3,12).","[Li, Xichen; Holland, David M.; Gerber, Edwin P.; Yoo, Changhyun] NYU, Courant Inst Math Sci, New York, NY 10012 USA","Li, XC (reprint author), NYU, Courant Inst Math Sci, 251 Mercer St, New York, NY 10012 USA.",xichen@cims.nyu.edu,,,NSF Office of Polar Programs [ANT-0732869]; NASA Polar Programs [NNX12AB69G]; New York University Abu Dhabi [G1204]; NSF Office of Atmospheric and Geospace Sciences [AGS-1264195]; National Science Foundation (NSF); Office of Science (BER) of the US Department of Energy (DOE),"X.L., D.M.H. and C.Y. were supported by the NSF Office of Polar Programs (grant number ANT-0732869), the NASA Polar Programs (grant number NNX12AB69G), and New York University Abu Dhabi (grant number G1204).

Understanding the mechanisms controlling the accumulation and stability of soil carbon is critical to predicting the Earth's future climate(2,3). Recent studies suggest that decomposition of soil organic matter is often limited by nitrogen availability to microbes(4-6) and that plants, via their fungal symbionts, compete directly with free-living decomposers for nitrogen(6,7). Ectomycorrhizal and ericoid mycorrhizal (EEM) fungi produce nitrogen-degrading enzymes, allowing them greater access to organic nitrogen sources than arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi(8-10). This leads to the theoretical prediction that soil carbon storage is greater in ecosystems dominated by EEM fungi than in those dominated by AM fungi(11). Using global data sets, we show that soil in ecosystems dominated by EEM-associated plants contains 70% more carbon per unit nitrogen than soil in ecosystems dominated by AM-associated plants. The effect of mycorrhizal type on soil carbon is independent of, and of far larger consequence than, the effects of net primary production, temperature, precipitation and soil clay content. Hence the effect of mycorrhizal type on soil carbon content holds at the global scale. This finding links the functional traits of mycorrhizal fungi to carbon storage at ecosystem-to-global scales, suggesting that plant-decomposer competition for nutrients exerts a fundamental control over the terrestrial carbon cycle.","[Averill, Colin] Univ Texas Austin, Dept Integrat Biol, Grad Program Ecol Evolut & Behav, Austin, TX 78712 USA; [Turner, Benjamin L.] Smithsonian Trop Res Inst, Balboa, Ancon, Panama; [Finzi, Adrien C.] Boston Univ, Dept Biol, Boston, MA 02215 USA","Averill, C (reprint author), Univ Texas Austin, Dept Integrat Biol, Grad Program Ecol Evolut & Behav, Austin, TX 78712 USA.",colin.averill@utexas.edu,"Turner, Benjamin/E-5940-2011; Finzi, Adrien/A-7017-2016","Turner, Benjamin/0000-0002-6585-0722; Finzi, Adrien/0000-0003-2220-4533","Center for Tropical Forest Science (CTFS); Smithsonian Institution Geo-observatories (SIGEO); University of Texas at Austin; National Science Foundation [DGE-1110007]; NSF [DEB 07-43564]; DOE [10-DOE-1053, DE-SC0006916]","We thank L.

The species belongs to the order of Caryophylalles, is diploid with 2n=18 chromosomes, has an estimated genome size of 714-758 megabases(1) and shares an ancient genome triplication with other eudicot plants(2). Leafy beets have been cultivated since Roman times, but sugar beet is one of the most recently domesticated crops. It arose in the late eighteenth century when lines accumulating sugar in the storage root were selected from crosses made with chard and fodder beet(3). Here we present a reference genome sequence for sugar beet as the first non-rosid, non-asterid eudicot genome, advancing comparative genomics and phylogenetic reconstructions. The genome sequence comprises 567 megabases, of which 85% could be assigned to chromosomes. The assembly covers a large proportion of the repetitive sequence content that was estimated(4) to be 63%. We predicted 27,421 protein-coding genes supported by transcript data and annotated them on the basis of sequence homology. Phylogenetic analyses provided evidence for the separation of Caryophyllales before the split of asterids and rosids, and revealed lineage-specific gene family expansions and losses. We sequenced spinach (Spinacia oleracea), another Caryophyllales species, and validated features that separate this clade from rosids and asterids. Intraspecific genomic variation was analysed based on the genome sequences of sea beet (Beta vulgaris ssp. maritima; progenitor of all beet crops) and four additional sugar beet accessions.

These common variants have replicable but small effects on LOAD risk and generally do not have obvious functional effects. Low-frequency coding variants, not detected by GWAS, are predicted to include functional variants with larger effects on risk. To identify low-frequency coding variants with large effects on LOAD risk, we carried out whole-exome sequencing (WES) in 14 large LOAD families and follow-up analyses of the candidate variants in several large LOAD case-control data sets. A rare variant in PLD3 (phospholipase D3; Val232Met) segregated with disease status in two independent families and doubled risk for Alzheimer's disease in seven independent case-control series with a total of more than 11,000 cases and controls of European descent. Gene-based burden analyses in 4,387 cases and controls of European descent and 302 African American cases and controls, with complete sequence data for PLD3, reveal that several variants in this gene increase risk for Alzheimer's disease in both populations. PLD3 is highly expressed in brain regions that are vulnerable to Alzheimer's disease pathology, including hippocampus and cortex, and is expressed at significantly lower levels in neurons from Alzheimer's disease brains compared to control brains. Overexpression of PLD3 leads to a significant decrease in intracellular amyloid-beta precursor protein (APP) and extracellular A beta 42 and A beta 40 (the 42- and 40-residue isoforms of the amyloid-beta peptide), and knockdown of PLD3 leads to a significant increase in extracellular A beta 42 and A beta 40. Together, our genetic and functional data indicate that carriers of PLD3 coding variants have a twofold increased risk for LOAD and that PLD3 influences APP processing. This study provides an example of how densely affected families may help to identify rare variants with large effects on risk for disease or other complex traits.","[Cruchaga, Carlos; Karch, Celeste M.; Jin, Sheng Chih; Benitez, Bruno A.; Cai, Yefei; Harari, Oscar; Norton, Joanne; Budde, John; Bertelsen, Sarah; Jeng, Amanda T.; Cooper, Breanna; Skorupa, Tara; Carrell, David; Levitch, Denise; Hsu, Simon; Choi, Jiyoon; Goate, Alison M.] Washington Univ, Dept Psychiat, St Louis, MO 63110 USA; [Cruchaga, Carlos; Karch, Celeste M.; Cairns, Nigel; Goate, Alison M.] Washington Univ, Hope Ctr Program Prot Aggregat & Neurodegenerat, St Louis, MO 63110 USA; [Guerreiro, Rita; Ryten, Mina; Sassi, Celeste; Bras, Jose; Gibbs, J.

An important question is whether stem cells also exhibit sex differences in physiological function and hormonal regulation in tissues that do not show sex-specific morphological differences. The terminal differentiation and function of some haematopoietic cells are regulated by sex hormones(7-10), but haematopoietic stem-cell function is thought to be similar in both sexes. Here we show that mouse haematopoietic stem cells exhibit sex differences in cell-cycle regulation by oestrogen. Haematopoietic stem cells in female mice divide significantly more frequently than in male mice. This difference depends on the ovaries but not the testes. Administration of oestradiol, a hormone produced mainly in the ovaries, increased haematopoietic stem-cell division in males and females. Oestrogen levels increased during pregnancy, increasing haematopoietic stem-cell division, haematopoietic stem-cell frequency, cellularity, and erythropoiesis in the spleen. Haematopoietic stem cells expressed high levels of oestrogen receptor-alpha (ER alpha). Conditional deletion of ER alpha from haematopoietic stem cells reduced haematopoietic stem-cell division in female, but not male, mice and attenuated the increases in haematopoietic stem-cell division, haematopoietic stem-cell frequency, and erythropoiesis during pregnancy. Oestrogen/ER alpha signalling promotes haematopoietic stem-cell self-renewal, expanding splenic haematopoietic stem cells and erythropoiesis during pregnancy.","[Nakada, Daisuke; Ryan, Nicole; Kitano, Ayumi; Saitoh, Yusuke; Takeichi, Makiko] Baylor Coll Med, Dept Mol & Human Genet, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Nakada, Daisuke] Baylor Coll Med, Stem Cells & Regenerat Med Ctr, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Nakada, Daisuke] Baylor Coll Med, Ctr Cell & Gene Therapy, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Oguro, Hideyuki; Morrison, Sean J.] Univ Texas SW Med Ctr Dallas, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Dept Pediat, Dallas, TX 75390 USA; [Oguro, Hideyuki; Morrison, Sean J.] Univ Texas SW Med Ctr Dallas, Childrens Res Inst, Dallas, TX 75390 USA; [Levi, Boaz P.; Wendt, George R.] Univ Michigan, Ctr Stem Cell Biol, Inst Life Sci, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA","Nakada, D (reprint author), Baylor Coll Med, Dept Mol & Human Genet, Houston, TX 77030 USA.",nakada@bcm.edu; Sean.Morrison@utsouthwestern.edu,,"Morrison, Sean/0000-0003-1587-8329; Oguro, Hideyuki/0000-0002-9070-4575","Cancer Prevention and Research Institute of Texas; National Heart Lung and Blood Institute [HL097760]; Irvington Institute-Cancer Research Institute/Edmond J.

Here we show that the short-term consumption of diets composed entirely of animal or plant products alters microbial community structure and overwhelms inter-individual differences in microbial gene expression. The animal-based diet increased the abundance of bile-tolerant microorganisms (Alistipes, Bilophila and Bacteroides) and decreased the levels of Firmicutes that metabolize dietary plant polysaccharides (Roseburia, Eubacterium rectale and Ruminococcus bromii). Microbial activity mirrored differences between herbivorous and carnivorous mammals(2), reflecting trade-offs between carbohydrate and protein fermentation. Foodborne microbes from both diets transiently colonized the gut, including bacteria, fungi and even viruses. Finally, increases in the abundance and activity of Bilophila wadsworthia on the animal-based diet support a link between dietary fat, bile acids and the outgrowth of microorganisms capable of triggering inflammatory bowel disease(6). In concert, these results demonstrate that the gut microbiome can rapidly respond to altered diet, potentially facilitating the diversity of human dietary lifestyles.","[David, Lawrence A.; Maurice, Corinne F.; Carmody, Rachel N.; Gootenberg, David B.; Button, Julie E.; Wolfe, Benjamin E.; Dutton, Rachel J.; Turnbaugh, Peter J.] Harvard Univ, FAS Ctr Syst Biol, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [David, Lawrence A.] Harvard Univ, Soc Fellows, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Ling, Alisha V.; Biddinger, Sudha B.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Childrens Hosp Boston, Div Endocrinol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Devlin, A.

Here we describe a new class of histone modification, methylation of glutamine, occurring on yeast histone H2A at position 105 (Q105) and human H2A at Q104. We identify Nop1 as the methyltransferase in yeast and demonstrate that fibrillarin is the orthologue enzyme in human cells. Glutamine methylation of H2A is restricted to the nucleolus. Global analysis in yeast, using an H2AQ105me-specific antibody, shows that this modification is exclusively enriched over the 35S ribosomal DNA transcriptional unit. We show that the Q105 residue is part of the binding site for the histone chaperone FACT (facilitator of chromatin transcription) complex(2). Methylation of Q105 or its substitution to alanine disrupts binding to FACT in vitro. A yeast strain mutated at Q105 shows reduced histone incorporation and increased transcription at the ribosomal DNA locus. These features are phenocopied by mutations in FACT complex components. Together these data identify glutamine methylation of H2A as the first histone epigenetic mark dedicated to a specific RNA polymerase and define its function as a regulator of FACT interaction with nucleosomes.","[Tessarz, Peter; Santos-Rosa, Helena; Robson, Samc.; Nelson, Christopher J.; Kouzarides, Tony] Univ Cambridge, Gurdon Inst, Cambridge CB2 1QN, England; [Tessarz, Peter; Santos-Rosa, Helena; Robson, Samc.; Nelson, Christopher J.; Kouzarides, Tony] Univ Cambridge, Dept Pathol, Cambridge CB2 1QN, England; [Sylvestersen, Kathrine B.; Nielsen, Michael L.] Univ Copenhagen, Fac Hlth Sci, Novo Nordisk Fdn Ctr Prot Res, Dept Prote, DK-2200 Copenhagen, Denmark","Kouzarides, T (reprint author), Univ Cambridge, Gurdon Inst, Tennis Court Rd, Cambridge CB2 1QN, England.",t.kouzarides@gurdon.cam.ac.uk,"Tessarz, Peter/I-9035-2014","Tessarz, Peter/0000-0002-6953-9835; Beck Sylvestersen, Kathrine/0000-0002-8201-4769; Nielsen, Michael/0000-0002-0067-9039",Cancer Research UK; Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council [BB/K017438/1],"We thank E.

Through a process known as enterohepatic recirculation, more than 90% of secreted bile acids are then retrieved from the intestine and returned to the liver for resecretion(1). In humans, there are two Na+-dependent bile acid transporters involved in enterohepatic recirculation, the Na+-taurocholate co-transporting polypeptide (NTCP; also known as SLC10A1) expressed in hepatocytes, and the apical sodium-dependent bile acid transporter (ASBT; also known as SLC10A2) expressed on enterocytes in the terminal ileum(2). In recent years, ASBT has attracted much interest as a potential drug target for treatment of hypercholesterolaemia, because inhibition of ASBT reduces reabsorption of bile acids, thus increasing bile acid synthesis and consequently cholesterol consumption(3,4). However, a lack of three-dimensional structures of bile acid transporters hampers our ability to understand the molecular mechanisms of substrate selectivity and transport, and to interpret the wealth of existing functional data(2,5-8). The crystal structure of an ASBT homologue from Neisseria meningitidis (ASBT(NM)) in detergent was reported recently(9), showing the protein in an inward-open conformation bound to two Na+ and a taurocholic acid. However, the structural changes that bring bile acid and Na+ across the membrane are difficult to infer from a single structure. To understand the structural changes associated with the coupled transport of Na+ and bile acids, here we solved two structures of an ASBT homologue from Yersinia frederiksenii (ASBT(Yf)) in a lipid environment, which reveal that a large rigid-body rotation of a substrate-binding domain gives the conserved 'crossover' region, where two discontinuous helices cross each other, alternating accessibility from either side of the cell membrane. This result has implications for the location and orientation of the bile acid during transport, as well as for the translocation pathway for Na+.","[Zhou, Xiaoming; Levin, Elena J.; Pan, Yaping; McCoy, Jason G.; Zhou, Ming] Baylor Coll Med, Verna & Marrs McLean Dept Biochem & Mol Biol, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Zhou, Xiaoming; Sharma, Ruchika; Zhou, Ming] Columbia Univ, Dept Physiol & Cellular Biophys, New York, NY 10032 USA; [Kloss, Brian; Bruni, Renato] New York Consortium Membrane Prot Struct, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Quick, Matthias] Columbia Univ, Dept Psychiat, New York, NY 10032 USA; [Quick, Matthias] Columbia Univ, Ctr Mol Recognit, New York, NY 10032 USA; [Quick, Matthias] New York State Psychiat Inst & Hosp, Div Mol Therapeut, New York, NY 10032 USA; [Zhou, Ming] Chinese Acad Sci, Kunming Inst Zool, Ion Channel Res & Drug Dev Ctr, Kunming 650223, Peoples R China","Zhou, M (reprint author), Baylor Coll Med, Verna & Marrs McLean Dept Biochem & Mol Biol, Houston, TX 77030 USA.",mq2102@columbia.edu; mzhou@bcm.edu,,,"US National Institutes of Health [R01DK088057, R01GM098878, U54GM095315, U54GM087519]; American Heart Association [12EIA8850017]; Cancer Prevention and Research Institute of Texas [R12MZ]","Data for this study were collected at beamlines 8.2.2 at the Advanced Light Source, X-29 at the National Synchrotron Light Source, and 24ID-E and 17ID-B at the Advanced Photon Source.

These CNVs may provide an entry point for investigations into the mechanisms of brain function and dysfunction alike. They are not fully penetrant and offer an opportunity to study their effects separate from that of manifest disease. Here we show in an Icelandic sample that a few of the CNVs clearly alter fecundity (measured as the number of children by age 45). Furthermore, we use various tests of cognitive function to demonstrate that control subjects carrying the CNVs perform at a level that is between that of schizophrenia patients and population controls. The CNVs do not all affect the same cognitive domains, hence the cognitive deficits that drive or accompany the pathogenesis vary from one CNV to another. Controls carrying the chromosome 15q11.2 deletion between breakpoints 1 and 2 (15q11.2(BP1-BP2) deletion) have a history of dyslexia and dyscalculia, even after adjusting for IQ in the analysis, and the CNV only confers modest effects on other cognitive traits.

Cohesin also has vital roles in DNA repair and transcriptional regulation. The ring-shaped cohesin complex is thought to encircle sister DNA strands, but its molecular mechanism of action is poorly understood and the biochemical reconstitution of cohesin activity in vitro has remained an unattained goal. Here we reconstitute cohesin loading onto DNA using purified fission yeast cohesin and its loader complex, Mis4(Scc2)-Ssl3(Scc4) (Schizosaccharomyces pombe gene names appear throughout with their more commonly known Saccharomyces cerevisiae counterparts added in superscript). Incubation of cohesin with DNA leads to spontaneous topological loading, but this remains inefficient. The loader contacts cohesin at multiple sites around the ring circumference, including the hitherto enigmatic Psc3(Scc3) subunit, and stimulates cohesin's ATPase, resulting in efficient topological loading. The in vitro reconstitution of cohesin loading onto DNA provides mechanistic insight into the initial steps of the establishment of sister chromatid cohesion and other chromosomal processes mediated by cohesin.","[Murayama, Yasuto; Uhlmann, Frank] Canc Res UK London Res Inst, Chromosome Segregat Lab, London WC2A 3LY, England","Uhlmann, F (reprint author), Canc Res UK London Res Inst, Chromosome Segregat Lab, 44 Lincolns Inn Fields, London WC2A 3LY, England.",frank.uhlmann@cancer.org.uk,,,European Research Council; Japanese Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS),"We are grateful to N.

Here we show that Escherichia coli UvrD binds RNA polymerase during transcription elongation and, using its helicase/translocase activity, forces RNA polymerase to slide backward along DNA. By inducing backtracking, UvrD exposes DNA lesions shielded by blocked RNA polymerase, allowing nucleotide excision repair enzymes to gain access to sites of damage. Our results establish UvrD as a bona fide transcription elongation factor that contributes to genomic integrity by resolving conflicts between transcription and DNA repair complexes. Furthermore, we show that the elongation factor NusA cooperates with UvrD in coupling transcription to DNA repair by promoting backtracking and recruiting nucleotide excision repair enzymes to exposed lesions. Because backtracking is a shared feature of all cellular RNA polymerases, we propose that this mechanism enables RNA polymerases to function as global DNA damage scanners in bacteria and eukaryotes.","[Epshtein, Vitaly; Kamarthapu, Venu; McGary, Katelyn; Svetlov, Vladimir; Ueberheide, Beatrix; Nudler, Evgeny] NYU, Sch Med, Dept Biochem & Mol Pharmacol, New York, NY 10016 USA; [Kamarthapu, Venu; Nudler, Evgeny] NYU, Sch Med, Howard Hughes Med Inst, New York, NY 10016 USA; [Proshkin, Sergey; Mironov, Alexander] State Res Inst Genet & Select Ind Microorganisms, Moscow 117545, Russia; [Mironov, Alexander] Russian Acad Sci, Engelhardt Inst Mol Biol, Moscow 119991, Russia","Nudler, E (reprint author), NYU, Sch Med, Dept Biochem & Mol Pharmacol, New York, NY 10016 USA.",evgeny.nudler@nyumc.org,"Proshkin, Sergey/G-2733-2017","Nudler, Evgeny/0000-0002-8811-3071; Ueberheide, Beatrix/0000-0003-2512-0204",Russian Foundation for Basic Research; NIH; BGRF; Dynasty foundation; Howard Hughes Medical Institute,"We thank D.

Binary evolution models also predict the existence of black holes accreting from the equatorial envelope of rapidly spinning Be-type stars(1-3) (stars of the Be type are hot blue irregular variables showing characteristic spectral emission lines of hydrogen). Of the approximately 80 Be X-ray binaries known in the Galaxy, however, only pulsating neutron stars have been found as companions(2-4). A black hole was formally allowed as a solution for the companion to the Be star MWC656 (ref. 5; also known as HD 215227), although that conclusion was based on a single radial velocity curve of the Be star, a mistaken spectral classification(6) and rough estimates of the inclination angle. Here we report observations of an accretion disk line mirroring the orbit of MWC656. This, together with an improved radial velocity curve of the Be star through fitting sharp Fe II profiles from the equatorial disk, and a refined Be classification (to that of a B1.5-B2 III star), indicates that a black hole of 3.8 to 6.9 solar masses orbits MWC656, the candidate counterpart of the gamma-ray source AGL J2241+4454 (refs 5, 6). The black hole is X-ray quiescent and fed by a radiatively inefficient accretion flow giving a luminosity less than 1.6x10(-7) times the Eddington luminosity. This implies that Be binaries with black-hole companions are difficult to detect in conventional X-ray surveys.","[Casares, J.; Herrero, A.; Simon-Diaz, S.] Inst Astrofis Canarias, E-28205 San Cristobal la Laguna, Santa Cruz De T, Spain; [Casares, J.; Herrero, A.; Simon-Diaz, S.] Univ La Laguna, Dept Astrofis, E-38206 San Cristobal la Laguna, Santa Cruz De T, Spain; [Negueruela, I.] Univ Alicante, Dept Fis Ingn Sistemas & Teoria Senal, E-03080 Alicante, Spain; [Ribo, M.; Paredes, J.

But using polymers to 'glue' together polymer gels is difficult, requiring chemical reactions, heating, pH changes, ultraviolet irradiation or an electric field(4-7). Here we show that strong, rapid adhesion between two hydrogels can be achieved at room temperature by spreading a droplet of a nanoparticle solution on one gel's surface and then bringing the other gel into contact with it. The method relies on the nanoparticles' ability to adsorb onto polymer gels and to act as connectors between polymer chains, and on the ability of polymer chains to reorganize and dissipate energy under stress when adsorbed onto nanoparticles. We demonstrate this approach by pressing together pieces of hydrogels, for approximately 30 seconds, that have the same or different chemical properties or rigidities, using various solutions of silica nanoparticles, to achieve a strong bond. Furthermore, we show that carbon nanotubes and cellulose nanocrystals that do not bond hydrogels together become adhesive when their surface chemistry is modified. To illustrate the promise of the method for biological tissues, we also glued together two cut pieces of calf's liver using a solution of silica nanoparticles. As a rapid, simple and efficient way to assemble gels or tissues, this method is desirable for many emerging technological and medical applications such as microfluidics, actuation, tissue engineering and surgery.","[Rose, Severine; Elziere, Paul; Hourdet, Dominique; Marcellan, Alba] Univ Paris 06, Ecole Super Phys & Chim Ind, CNRS, Physicochim Polymeres & Milieux Disperses UMR7615, F-75005 Paris, France; [Prevoteau, Alexandre; Marcellan, Alba; Leibler, Ludwik] Ecole Super Phys & Chim Ind Ville Paris, CNRS, Matiere Molle & Chim UMR 7167, F-75005 Paris, France","Leibler, L (reprint author), Ecole Super Phys & Chim Ind Ville Paris, CNRS, Matiere Molle & Chim UMR 7167, 10 Rue Vauquelin, F-75005 Paris, France.",alba.marcellan@espci.fr; ludwik.leibler@espci.fr,,,"ED397, UPMC, Paris France; CNRS; ESPCI; UPMC","We thank D.

Alkenes also have the attractive feature of being stable in the presence of many acids, bases, oxidants and reductants. In spite of these attributes, relatively few catalytic enantioselective transformations have been developed that transform aliphatic alpha-olefins into chiral products with an enantiomeric excess greater then 90 per cent. With the exception of site-controlled isotactic polymerization of alpha-olefins(1), none of these catalytic enantioselective processes results in chain-extending carbon-carbon bond formation to the terminal carbon(2-6). Here we describe a strategy that directly addresses this gap in synthetic methodology, and present a single-flask, catalytic enantioselective conversion of terminal alkenes into a number of chiral products. These reactions are facilitated by a neighbouring functional group that accelerates palladium-catalysed cross-coupling of 1,2-bis(boronates) relative to non-functionalized alkyl boronate analogues. In tandem with enantioselective diboration, this reactivity feature transforms alkene starting materials into a diverse array of chiral products. We note that the tandem diboration/cross-coupling reaction generally provides products in high yield and high selectivity (>95:5 enantiomer ratio), uses low loadings (1-2 mol per cent) of commercially available catalysts and reagents, offers an expansive substrate scope, and can address a broad range of alcohol and amine synthesis targets, many of which cannot be easily addressed with current technology.","[Mlynarski, Scott N.; Schuster, Christopher H.; Morken, James P.] Boston Coll, Dept Chem, Merkert Chem Ctr, Chestnut Hill, MA 02467 USA","Morken, JP (reprint author), Boston Coll, Dept Chem, Merkert Chem Ctr, Chestnut Hill, MA 02467 USA.",morken@bc.edu,,,"US National Institutes of Health, Institute of General Medical Sciences [GM-59417]; John LaMattina graduate fellowships","This research was supported by the US National Institutes of Health, Institute of General Medical Sciences (grant GM-59417).

This approach implicitly assumes that river incision rates are in equilibrium with external forcings over a wide range of timescales. Here we directly test this assumption by examining the temporal scaling of bedrock river incision from 155 independent measurements of river incision compiled from 14 sites. Of these sites, 11 exhibit a negative power-law dependence of bedrock river incision rate on measurement interval, a relationship that is apparent over timescales of 10(4)-10(7) years and is independent of tectonic and geomorphic setting. Thus, like rates of sediment accumulation(5), rates of river incision into bedrock exhibit non-steady-state behaviour even over very long measurement intervals. Non-steady-state behaviour can be explained by episodic hiatuses in river incision triggered by alluvial deposition, if such hiatuses have a heavy-tailed length distribution(6). Regardless of its cause, the dependence of incision rate on measurement interval complicates efforts to infer tectonic or climatic forcing from changes in rates of river incision over time or from comparison of rates computed over different timescales.","[Finnegan, Noah J.] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA; [Schumer, Rina] Desert Res Inst, Div Hydrol Sci, Reno, NV 89512 USA; [Finnegan, Seth] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Integrat Biol, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA","Finnegan, NJ (reprint author), Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA.",nfinnega@ucsc.edu,"Schumer, Rina/H-1179-2011","Schumer, Rina/0000-0001-6094-5637",National Science Foundation [EAR-1049889],"This study was supported in part by the National Science Foundation (EAR-1049889).

A recent estimate suggests that up to 3 petagrams of carbon per year could be emitted as carbon dioxide (CO2) from global inland waters, offsetting the carbon uptake by terrestrial ecosystems(2). It is generally assumed that inland waters emit carbon that has been previously fixed upstream by land plant photosynthesis, then transferred to soils, and subsequently transported downstream in run-off. But at the scale of entire drainage basins, the lateral carbon fluxes carried by small rivers upstream do not account for all of the CO2 emitted from inundated areas downstream(3,4). Three-quarters of the world's flooded land consists of temporary wetlands(5), but the contribution of these productive ecosystems(6) to the inland water carbon budget has been largely overlooked. Here we show that wetlands pump large amounts of atmospheric CO2 into river waters in the floodplains of the central Amazon. Flooded forests and floating vegetation export large amounts of carbon to river waters and the dissolved CO2 can be transported dozens to hundreds of kilometres downstream before being emitted. We estimate that Amazonian wetlands export half of their gross primary production to river waters as dissolved CO2 and organic carbon, compared with only a few per cent of gross primary production exported in upland (not flooded) ecosystems(1,7). Moreover, we suggest that wetland carbon export is potentially large enough to account for at least the 0.21 petagrams of carbon emitted per year as CO2 from the central Amazon River and its floodplains(8). Global carbon budgets should explicitly address temporary or vegetated flooded areas, because these ecosystems combine high aerial primary production with large, fast carbon export, potentially supporting a substantial fraction of CO2 evasion from inland waters.","[Abril, Gwenael; Savoye, Nicolas; Deborde, Jonathan] Univ Bordeaux 1, CNRS, Lab Environm & Paleoenvironm Ocean & Continentaux, F-33405 Talence, France; [Abril, Gwenael; Martinez, Jean-Michel; Moreira-Turcq, Patricia] Univ Toulouse 3, Inst Rech Dev, Lab Geosci & Environm Toulouse, F-31400 Toulouse, France; [Artigas, L.

The most quoted function of these configurations is to reduce energy expenditure and enhance locomotor performance of individuals in the assemblage(4-11). The distinctive V formation of bird flocks has long intrigued researchers and continues to attract both scientific and popular attention(4,7,9-14). The well-held belief is that such aggregations give an energetic benefit for those birds that are flying behind and to one side of another bird through using the regions of upwash generated by the wings of the preceding bird(4,7,9-11), although a definitive account of the aerodynamic implications of these formations has remained elusive. Here we show that individuals of northern bald ibises (Geronticus eremita) flying in a V flock position themselves in aerodynamically optimum positions, in that they agree with theoretical aerodynamic predictions. Furthermore, we demonstrate that birds show wingtip path coherence when flying in V positions, flapping spatially in phase and thus enabling upwash capture to be maximized throughout the entire flap cycle. In contrast, when birds fly immediately behind another bird-in a streamwise position-there is no wingtip path coherence; the wing-beats are in spatial anti-phase. This could potentially reduce the adverse effects of downwash for the following bird. These aerodynamic accomplishments were previously not thought possible for birds because of the complex flight dynamics and sensory feedback that would be required to perform such a feat(12,14). We conclude that the intricate mechanisms involved in V formation flight indicate awareness of the spatial wake structures of nearby flock-mates, and remarkable ability either to sense or predict it. We suggest that birds in V formation have phasing strategies to cope with the dynamic wakes produced by flapping wings.","[Portugal, Steven J.; Hubel, Tatjana Y.; Hailes, Stephen; Wilson, Alan M.; Usherwood, James R.] Univ London, Royal Vet Coll, Struct & Mot Lab, Hatfield AL9 7TA, Herts, England; [Fritz, Johannes; Heese, Stefanie; Trobe, Daniela; Voelkl, Bernhard] Waldrappteam, A-6162 Mutters, Austria; [Voelkl, Bernhard] Humboldt Univ, Inst Theoret Biol, D-10115 Berlin, Germany; [Hailes, Stephen] UCL, Dept Comp Sci, London WC1E 6BT, England","Portugal, SJ (reprint author), Univ London, Royal Vet Coll, Struct & Mot Lab, Hatfield AL9 7TA, Herts, England.",SPortugal@rvc.ac.uk,"Voelkl, Bernhard/D-1390-2009","Voelkl, Bernhard/0000-0001-5454-2508; Hubel, Tatjana/0000-0002-6749-6747",Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council [EP/H013016/1]; Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council [BB/J018007/1]; Wellcome Trust [095061/Z/10/Z],"The Waldrappteam assisted with data collection and provided logistical support (J.F., B.V.).

Whether neural activity also influences the patterning of the vascular bed is not known. Here we show in neonatal mice, that neither reduction of sensory input through whisker trimming nor moderately increased activity by environmental enrichment affects cortical microvascular development. Unexpectedly, chronic stimulation by repetitive sounds, whisker deflection or motor activity led to a near arrest of angiogenesis in barrel, auditory and motor cortices, respectively. Chemically induced seizures also caused robust reductions in microvascular density. However, altering neural activity in adult mice did not affect the vasculature. Histological analysis and time-lapse in vivo two-photon microscopy revealed that hyperactivity did not lead to cell death or pruning of existing vessels but rather to reduced endothelial proliferation and vessel sprouting. This anti-angiogenic effect was prevented by administration of the nitric oxide synthase (NOS) inhibitor L-NAME and in mice with neuronal and inducible NOS deficiency, suggesting that excessive nitric oxide released from hyperactive interneurons and glia inhibited vessel growth. Vascular deficits persisted long after cessation of hyperstimulation, providing evidence for a critical period after which proper microvascular patterning cannot be re-established. Reduced microvascular density diminished the ability of the brain to compensate for hypoxic challenges, leading to dendritic spine loss in regions distant from capillaries. Therefore, excessive sensorimotor stimulation and repetitive neural activation during early childhood may cause lifelong deficits in microvascular reserve, which could have important consequences for brain development, function and pathology.","[Whiteus, Christina; Freitas, Catarina; Grutzendler, Jaime] Yale Univ, Sch Med, Dept Neurol, New Haven, CT 06511 USA; [Whiteus, Christina; Grutzendler, Jaime] Yale Univ, Sch Med, Dept Neurobiol, New Haven, CT 06510 USA","Grutzendler, J (reprint author), Yale Univ, Sch Med, Dept Neurol, 333 Cedar St, New Haven, CT 06511 USA.",jaime.grutzendler@yale.edu,"Freitas, Catarina/A-2555-2017","Freitas, Catarina/0000-0002-3393-5326",AHA [10POST2570007];  [R01AG027855];  [R01HL106815];  [F31NS068041],"The authors appreciate the expert advice of W.

A protective mucus barrier traps and eliminates them through mucociliary clearance (MCC)(1,2). However, excessive mucus contributes to transient respiratory infections and to the pathogenesis of numerous respiratory diseases(1). MUC5AC and MUC5B are evolutionarily conserved genes that encode structurally related mucin glycoproteins, the principal macromolecules in airway mucus(1,3). Genetic variants are linked to diverse lung diseases(4-6), but specific roles for MUC5AC and MUC5B in MCC, and the lasting effects of their inhibition, are unknown. Here we show that mouse Muc5b (but not Muc5ac) is required for MCC, for controlling infections in the airways and middle ear, and for maintaining immune homeostasis in mouse lungs, whereas Muc5ac is dispensable. Muc5b deficiency caused materials to accumulate in upper and lower airways. This defect led to chronic infection by multiple bacterial species, including Staphylococcus aureus, and to inflammation that failed to resolve normally(7). Apoptotic macrophages accumulated, phagocytosis was impaired, and interleukin-23 (IL-23) production was reduced in Muc5b(-/-) mice. By contrast, in mice that transgenically overexpress Muc5b, macrophage functions improved. Existing dogma defines mucous phenotypes in asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) as driven by increased MUC5AC, with MUC5B levels either unaffected or increased in expectorated sputum(1,8). However, in many patients, MUC5B production at airway surfaces decreases by as much as 90%(9-11). By distinguishing a specific role for Muc5b in MCC, and by determining its impact on bacterial infections and inflammation in mice, our results provide a refined framework for designing targeted therapies to control mucin secretion and restore MCC.","[Roy, Michelle G.; McElwee, Melissa M.; Evans, Scott E.; Alexander, Samantha N.; Bellinghausen, Lindsey K.; Song, Alfred S.; Petrova, Youlia M.; Tuvim, Michael J.; Adachi, Roberto; Romo, Irlanda; De la Garza, Maria M.; Moghaddam, Seyed J.; Dickey, Burton F.; Evans, Christopher M.] Univ Texas MD Anderson Canc Ctr, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Livraghi-Butrico, Alessandra; Davis, C.

The shoot apical meristem (SAM), a specialized tissue producing plant aerial organs, is a developmental system of choice to address this question. Organs are periodically initiated at the SAM at specific spatial positions and this spatiotemporal pattern defines phyllotaxis. Accumulation of the plant hormone auxin triggers organ initiation(2-5), whereas auxin depletion around organs generates inhibitory fields that are thought to be sufficient to maintain these patterns and their dynamics(4,6-13). Here we show that another type of hormone-based inhibitory fields, generated directly downstream of auxin by intercellular movement of the cytokinin signalling inhibitor ARABIDOPSIS HISTIDINE PHOSPHOTRANSFER PROTEIN 6 (AHP6)(14), is involved in regulating phyllotactic patterns. We demonstrate that AHP6-based fields establish patterns of cytokinin signalling in the meristem that contribute to the robustness of phyllotaxis by imposing a temporal sequence on organ initiation. Our findings indicate that not one but two distinct hormone-based fields may be required for achieving temporal precision during formation of reiterative structures at the SAM, thus indicating an original mechanism for providing robustness to a dynamic developmental system.","[Besnard, Fabrice; Morin, Valerie; Marteaux, Benjamin; Brunoud, Geraldine; Chambrier, Pierre; Rozier, Frederique; Mirabet, Vincent; Legrand, Jonathan; Laine, Stephanie; Cellier, Coralie; Das, Pradeep; Boudaoud, Arezki; Traas, Jan; Vernoux, Teva] Univ Lyon, Lab Reprod & Dev Plantes, CNRS, INRA,ENS Lyon,UCBL, F-69364 Lyon, France; [Refahi, Yassin; Legrand, Jonathan; Farcot, Etienne; Godin, Christophe; Guedon, Yann] Inst Biol Computat, Virtual Plants INRIA, INRA Project Team, CIRAD,UMRAGAP, F-34095 Montpellier, France; [Mirabet, Vincent; Legrand, Jonathan; Das, Pradeep; Boudaoud, Arezki] Univ Lyon, Lab Joliot Curie, CNRS, ENS Lyon, F-69364 Lyon, France; [Thevenon, Emmanuel; Dumas, Renaud; Parcy, Francois] UJF, Lab Physiol Cellulaire & Vegetale, CEA, CNRS,INRA, F-38041 Grenoble, France; [Bishopp, Anthony; Helariutta, Yka] Univ Helsinki, Dept Biosci, Inst Biotechnol, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland","Vernoux, T (reprint author), Univ Lyon, Lab Reprod & Dev Plantes, CNRS, INRA,ENS Lyon,UCBL, F-69364 Lyon, France.",teva.vernoux@ens-lyon.fr,"Dumas, Renaud/E-1835-2011; Boudaoud, Arezki/Q-7436-2016","Boudaoud, Arezki/0000-0002-2780-4717; Vernoux, Teva/0000-0002-8257-4088",Human Frontier Science Program Organization [HFSPO CDA 0047/2007]; Agence National de la Recherche [ANR-07-JCJC-0115]; AuxiFlo [ANR-12-BSV6-0005]; transnational EraSysBio Grant (iSAM); French Ministry of Research; CJS grant from INRA,"We thank M.

Notably, type II acyl carrier proteins serve as a crucial interaction hub in primary cellular metabolism(1) by communicating transiently between partner enzymes of the numerous biosynthetic pathways(2,3). However, the highly transient nature of such interactions and the inherent conformational mobility of acyl carrier protein(2) have stymied previous attempts to visualize structurally acyl carrier protein tied to an overall catalytic cycle. This is essential to understanding a fundamental aspect of cellular metabolism leading to compounds that are not only useful to the cell, but also of therapeutic value. For example, acyl carrier protein is central to the biosynthesis of the lipid A (endotoxin) component of lipopolysaccharides in Gram-negative microorganisms, which is required for their growth and survival(4,5), and is an activator of the mammalian host's immune system(6,7), thus emerging as an important therapeutic target(8-10). During lipid A synthesis (Raetz pathway), acyl carrier protein shuttles acyl intermediates linked to its prosthetic 4'-phosphopantetheine group(2) among four acyltransferases, including LpxD(11). Here we report the crystal structures of three forms of Escherichia coli acyl carrier protein engaging LpxD, which represent stalled substrate and liberated products along the reaction coordinate. The structures show the intricate interactions at the interface that optimally position acyl carrier protein for acyl delivery and that directly involve the pantetheinyl group. Conformational differences among the stalled acyl carrier proteins provide the molecular basis for the association-dissociation process. An unanticipated conformational shift of 4'-phosphopantetheine groups within the LpxD catalytic chamber shows an unprecedented role of acyl carrier protein in product release.","[Masoudi, Ali; Raetz, Christian R.

Because FAS enzymes operate on ACP-bound acyl groups, ACP must stabilize and transport the growing lipid chain(2). ACPs have a central role in transporting starting materials and intermediates throughout the fatty acid biosynthetic pathway(3-5). The transient nature of ACP-enzyme interactions impose major obstacles to obtaining high-resolution structural information about fatty acid biosynthesis, and a new strategy is required to study protein-protein interactions effectively. Here we describe the application of a mechanism-based probe that allows active site-selective covalent crosslinking of AcpP to FabA, the Escherichia coli ACP and fatty acid 3-hydroxyacyl-ACP dehydratase, respectively. We report the 1.9 angstrom crystal structure of the crosslinked AcpP-FabA complex as a homodimer in which AcpP exhibits two different conformations, representing probable snapshots of ACP in action: the 4'-phosphopantetheine group of AcpP first binds an arginine-rich groove of FabA, then an AcpP helical conformational change locks AcpP and FabA in place. Residues at the interface of AcpP and FabA are identified and validated by solution nuclear magnetic resonance techniques, including chemical shift perturbations and residual dipolar coupling measurements. These not only support our interpretation of the crystal structures but also provide an animated view of ACP in action during fatty acid dehydration. These techniques, in combination with molecular dynamics simulations, show for the first time that FabA extrudes the sequestered acyl chain from the ACP binding pocket before dehydration by repositioning helix III. Extensive sequence conservation among carrier proteins suggests that the mechanistic insights gleaned from our studies may be broadly applicable to fatty acid, polyketide and non-ribosomal biosynthesis. Here the foundation is laid for defining the dynamic action of carrier-protein activity in primary and secondary metabolism, providing insight into pathways that can have major roles in the treatment of cancer, obesity and infectious disease.","[Chi Nguyen; Bruegger, Joel; Caldara-Festin, Grace; Jackson, David R.; Tsai, Shiou-Chuan] Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Mol Biol & Biochem, Irvine, CA 92697 USA; [Chi Nguyen; Bruegger, Joel; Caldara-Festin, Grace; Jackson, David R.; Tsai, Shiou-Chuan] Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Chem, Irvine, CA 92697 USA; [Chi Nguyen; Bruegger, Joel; Caldara-Festin, Grace; Jackson, David R.; Tsai, Shiou-Chuan] Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Pharmaceut Sci, Irvine, CA 92697 USA; [Haushalter, Robert W.; Lee, D.

Many bacteriophages use a tail to perform this function, whereas tail-less phages rely on host organelles(2-4). However, the tail-less, icosahedral, single-stranded DNA Phi X174-like coliphages do not fall into these well-defined infection processes. For these phages, DNA delivery requires a DNA pilot protein(5). Here we show that the Phi X174 pilot protein H oligomerizes to forma tube whose function is most probably to deliver the DNA genome across the host's periplasmic space to the cytoplasm. The 2.4 angstrom resolution crystal structure of the in vitro assembled H protein's central domain consists of a 170 angstrom-long alpha-helical barrel. The tube is constructed of ten alpha-helices with their amino termini arrayed in a right-handed super-helical coiled-coil and their carboxy termini arrayed in a left-handed super-helical coiled-coil. Genetic and biochemical studies demonstrate that the tube is essential for infectivity but does not affect in vivo virus assembly. Cryo-electron tomograms show that tubes span the periplasmic space and are present while the genome is being delivered into the host cell's cytoplasm. Both ends of the H protein contain transmembrane domains, which anchor the assembled tubes into the inner and outer cell membranes. The central channel of the H-protein tube is lined with amide and guanidinium side chains. This may be a general property of viral DNA conduits and is likely to be critical for efficient genome translocation into the host.","[Sun, Lei; Zhang, Xinzheng; Boudko, Sergei P.; Fokine, Andrei; Zbornik, Erica; Rossmann, Michael G.] Purdue Univ, Dept Biol Sci, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA; [Young, Lindsey N.; Roznowski, Aaron P.; Fane, Bentley A.] Univ Arizona, Sch Plant Sci, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA; [Young, Lindsey N.; Roznowski, Aaron P.; Fane, Bentley A.] Univ Arizona, Inst BIO5, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA; [Molineux, Ian J.] Univ Texas Austin, Inst Cell & Mol Biol, Austin, TX 78712 USA","Rossmann, MG (reprint author), Purdue Univ, Dept Biol Sci, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA.",mr@purdue.edu; bfane@email.arizona.edu,"Zhang , Xinzheng/E-6339-2013; Sun, Lei/F-5167-2012",,"US Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences [DEAC02-06CH11357]; National Science Foundation [MCB-0948399, MCB-0443899]; US Department of Agriculture","We thank S.

A genotype moulds its phenotype's age patterns of mortality and fertility in an environment; these two patterns in turn determine the genotype's fitness in that environment. Hence, to understand the evolution of ageing, age patterns of mortality and reproduction need to be compared for species across the tree of life. However, few studies have done so and only for a limited range of taxa. Here we contrast standardized patterns over age for 11 mammals, 12 other vertebrates, 10 invertebrates, 12 vascular plants and a green alga. Although it has been predicted that evolution should inevitably lead to increasing mortality and declining fertility with age after maturity, there is great variation among these species, including increasing, constant, decreasing, humped and bowed trajectories for both long-and short-lived species. This diversity challenges theoreticians to develop broader perspectives on the evolution of ageing and empiricists to study the demography of more species.","[Jones, Owen R.; Dahlgren, Johan P.; Vaupel, James W.] Max Planck Odense Ctr Biodemog Aging, DK-5230 Odense M, Denmark; [Jones, Owen R.; Dahlgren, Johan P.; Caswell, Hal] Univ Southern Denmark, Dept Biol, DK-5230 Odense M, Denmark; [Scheuerlein, Alexander; Salguero-Gomez, Roberto; Schaible, Ralf; Caswell, Hal; Baudisch, Annette; Vaupel, James W.] Max Planck Inst Demog Res, D-18057 Rostock, Germany; [Salguero-Gomez, Roberto] Univ Queensland, Ctr Biodivers & Conservat Sci, Sch Biol Sci, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia; [Camarda, Carlo Giovanni] Inst Natl Etud Demog, F-75980 Paris 20, France; [Casper, Brenda B.] Univ Penn, Dept Biol, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Ehrlen, Johan] Stockholm Univ, Dept Ecol Environm & Plant Sci, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden; [Garcia, Maria B.] CSIC, Pyrenean Inst Ecol, Zaragoza 50059, Spain; [Menges, Eric S.] Archbold Biol Stn, Venus, FL 33960 USA; [Quintana-Ascencio, Pedro F.] Univ Cent Florida, Dept Biol, Orlando, FL 32816 USA; [Caswell, Hal] Woods Hole Oceanog Inst, Biol Dept MS 34, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA; [Caswell, Hal] Univ Amsterdam, Inst Biodivers & Ecosyst Dynam, NL-1090 GE Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Vaupel, James W.] Duke Univ, Duke Populat Res Inst, Durham, NC 27705 USA","Jones, OR (reprint author), Max Planck Odense Ctr Biodemog Aging, Campusvej 55, DK-5230 Odense M, Denmark.",jones@biology.sdu.dk,"Jones, Owen/B-8439-2008; Salguero-Gomez, Roberto/N-6016-2016; Andersen, Mette Adalheidur/D-5608-2017","Jones, Owen/0000-0001-5720-4686; Salguero-Gomez, Roberto/0000-0002-6085-4433; Caswell, Hal/0000-0003-4394-6894; Ehrlen, Johan/0000-0001-8539-8967",NIH [PO1 AG-031719]; Alexander von Humboldt Foundation; European Research Council [322989]; ARC [DP110100727]; Max Planck Society,"We thank S.

Gnathostomes subsequently diverged into two groups, the cartilaginous fishes and the bony vertebrates. Here we report the whole-genome analysis of a cartilaginous fish, the elephant shark (Callorhinchus milii). We find that the C. milii genome is the slowest evolving of all known vertebrates, including the ` living fossil' coelacanth, and features extensive synteny conservation with tetrapod genomes, making it a goodmodel for comparative analyses of gnathostome genomes. Our functional studies suggest that the lack of genes encoding secreted calcium-binding phosphoproteins in cartilaginous fishes explains the absence of bone in their endoskeleton. Furthermore, the adaptive immune system of cartilaginous fishes is unusual: it lacks the canonical CD4 co-receptor and most transcription factors, cytokines and cytokine receptors related to the CD4 lineage, despite the presence of polymorphic major histocompatibility complex class II molecules. It thus presents a new model for understanding the origin of adaptive immunity.","[Venkatesh, Byrappa; Lee, Alison P.; Ravi, Vydianathan; Lian, Michelle M.; Lim, Zhi Wei; Tay, Boon-Hui; Tohari, Sumanty; Tay, Alice; Brenner, Sydney] ASTAR, Inst Mol & Cell Biol, Comparat Genom Lab, Biopolis, Singapore 138673, Singapore; [Venkatesh, Byrappa] Natl Univ Singapore, Yong Loo Lin Sch Med, Dept Paediat, Singapore 119228, Singapore; [Maurya, Ashish K.; Ingham, Philip W.] ASTAR, Inst Mol & Cell Biol, Dev & Biomed Genet Lab, Biopolis, Singapore 138673, Singapore; [Swann, Jeremy B.; Boehm, Thomas] Max Planck Inst Immunobiol & Epigenet, Dept Dev Immunol, D-79108 Freiburg, Germany; [Ohta, Yuko; Flajnik, Martin F.] Univ Maryland, Dept Microbiol & Immunol, Baltimore, MD 21201 USA; [Sutoh, Yoichi; Kasahara, Masanori] Hokkaido Univ, Grad Sch Med, Dept Pathol, Sapporo, Hokkaido 0608638, Japan; [Hoon, Shawn; Gangu, Vamshidhar; Kong, Kiat Whye; Ho, Shufen] ASTAR, Inst Biomed Sci, Mol Engn Lab, Biopolis, Singapore 138673, Singapore; [Roy, Scott W.] San Francisco State Univ, Dept Biol, San Francisco, CA 94132 USA; [Irimia, Manuel] Univ Toronto, Banting & Best Dept Med Res, Toronto, ON M5S 3E1, Canada; [Irimia, Manuel] Univ Toronto, Donnelly Ctr, Toronto, ON M5S 3E1, Canada; [Korzh, Vladimir; Kondrychyn, Igor] ASTAR, Inst Mol & Cell Biol, Fish Dev Biol Lab, Biopolis, Singapore 138673, Singapore; [Lorente-Galdos, Belen; Quilez, Javier; Marques-Bonet, Tomas] Inst Biol Evolut UPF CSIC, PRBB, Barcelona 08003, Spain; [Lorente-Galdos, Belen; Quilez, Javier; Marques-Bonet, Tomas] ICREA, Barcelona 08010, Catalonia, Spain; [Raney, Brian J.] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Sch Engn, Ctr Biomol Sci & Engn, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA; [Hillier, LaDeana W.; Minx, Patrick; Wilson, Richard K.; Warren, Wesley C.] Washington Univ, Genome Inst, St Louis, MO 63108 USA","Venkatesh, B (reprint author), ASTAR, Inst Mol & Cell Biol, Comparat Genom Lab, Biopolis, Singapore 138673, Singapore.",mcbbv@imcb.a-star.edu.sg; wwarren@genome.wustl.edu,"; Kasahara, Masanori/G-7651-2011; Irimia, Manuel/E-3040-2010; Marques-Bonet, Tomas/I-4618-2014; ASTAR, IMCB/E-2320-2012; Ingham, Philip/G-9903-2011; Korzh, Vladimir/H-1596-2011; Kondrychyn, Igor/C-2621-2016; Quilez, Javier/J-7107-2015; Vydianathan, Ravi/B-2759-2009; Lim, Zhiwei/Q-7858-2016","Venkatesh, Byrappa/0000-0003-3620-0277; Irimia, Manuel/0000-0002-2179-2567; Lorente-Galdos, Belen/0000-0001-5390-2452; Marques-Bonet, Tomas/0000-0002-5597-3075; Ingham, Philip/0000-0001-8224-9958; Korzh, Vladimir/0000-0002-6580-7986; Kondrychyn, Igor/0000-0002-2268-7291; Quilez, Javier/0000-0002-0108-2672; Vydianathan, Ravi/0000-0003-0807-7697; Lim, Zhiwei/0000-0003-4620-1986; Flajnik, Martin Francis/0000-0002-2792-5084; Gangu, Vamshidhar/0000-0002-8012-9394","National Human Genome Research Institute, USA; Biomedical Research Council of A*STAR, Singapore; A*STAR Computational Resource Centre; Max Planck Society; NIH [RR006603, AI27877]; Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan; Human Frontiers Science Program Organization; ERC [260372]; MICINN (Spain) [BFU2011-28549]; ICREA","Generation of C. milii genome sequence at the Genome Institute at Washington University was supported by grants from the National Human Genome Research Institute, USA.

However, the requirement for Wnts to spread has never been directly tested. Here we used genome engineering to replace the endogenous wingless gene, which encodes the main Drosophila Wnt, with one that expresses a membrane-tethered form of the protein. Surprisingly, the resulting flies were viable and produced normally patterned appendages of nearly the right size, albeit with a delay. We show that, in the prospective wing, prolonged wingless transcription followed by memory of earlier signalling allows persistent expression of relevant target genes. We suggest therefore that the spread of Wingless is dispensable for patterning and growth even though it probably contributes to increasing cell proliferation.","[Alexandre, Cyrille; Baena-Lopez, Alberto; Vincent, Jean-Paul] Natl Inst Med Res, MRC, London NW7 1AA, England","Vincent, JP (reprint author), Natl Inst Med Res, MRC, Mill Hill, London NW7 1AA, England.",jvincen@nimr.mrc.ac.uk,,/0000-0002-8663-3794,UK Medical Research Council [U117584268]; ERC grant (WNTEXPORT) from the European Union; Sir Henry Wellcome post-doctoral fellowship [082694/Z/07/Z],"This work was supported by the UK Medical Research Council (U117584268), an ERC grant (WNTEXPORT) from the European Union to JPV and a Sir Henry Wellcome post-doctoral fellowship to L.

A prototypical example is the galaxy Himiko (z = 6.6), which-a mere 840 million years after the Big Bang-is forming stars at a rate of 30-100 solar masses per year, yielding a mass assembly time of about 150 x 10(6) years. Himiko is thought to have a low fraction (2-3 per cent of the Sun's) of elements heavier than helium (low metallicity), and although its gas mass cannot yet be determined its dust-to-stellar mass ratio is constrained(3) to be less than 0.05 per cent. The local dwarf galaxy I Zwicky 18, which has a metallicity about 4 per cent that of the Sun's(4) and is forming stars less rapidly (assembly time about 1.6 x 10(9) years) than Himiko but still vigorously for its mass(5), is also very dust deficient and is perhaps one of the best analogues of primitive galaxies accessible to detailed study. Here we report observations of dust emission from I Zw 18, from which we determine its dust mass to be 450-1,800 solar masses, yielding a dust-to-stellar mass ratio of about 10(-6) to 10(-5) and a dust-to-gas mass ratio of 3.2-13 x 10(-6). If I Zw 18 is a reasonable analogue of Himiko, then Himiko's dust mass must be around 50,000 solar masses, a factor of 100 below the current upper limit. These numbers are quite uncertain, but if most high-z galaxies are more like Himiko than like the very-high-dust-mass galaxy SDSS J114816.64 + 525150.3 at z approximate to 6, which hosts a quasar(6), then our prospects for detecting the gas and dust inside such galaxies are much poorer than hitherto anticipated.","[Fisher, David B.; Bolatto, Alberto D.; Herrera-Camus, Rodrigo; Donaldson, Jessica] Univ Maryland, Dept Astron, Lab Millimeter Wave Astron, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Fisher, David B.; Bolatto, Alberto D.; Herrera-Camus, Rodrigo; Donaldson, Jessica] Univ Maryland, Joint Space Inst, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Fisher, David B.] Swinburne Univ Technol, Ctr Astrophys & Supercomp, Hawthorn, Vic 3122, Australia; [Draine, Bruce T.] Princeton Univ, Dept Astrophys Sci, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Walter, Fabian; Sandstrom, Karin M.] Max Planck Inst Astron, D-69117 Heidelberg, Germany; [Leroy, Adam K.] Natl Radio Astron Observ, Charlottesville, VA 22903 USA; [Cannon, John] Macalester Coll, Dept Phys & Astron, St Paul, MN 55105 USA; [Gordon, Karl] Space Telescope Sci Inst, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA","Fisher, DB (reprint author), Univ Maryland, Dept Astron, Lab Millimeter Wave Astron, College Pk, MD 20742 USA.",dfisher@swin.edu.au; bolatto@astro.umd.edu,,,"University of Maryland; Laboratory for Millimeter Astronomy; NSF [AST0838178, AST1008570, AST1211683]; CAREER NSF [AST0955836, AST1139998]; Research Corporation for Science Advancement Cottrell Scholar award; Marie Curie International Incoming fellowship; BMVIT (Austria); ESA-PRODEX (Belgium); CEA/CNES (France); DLR (Germany); ASI/INAF (Italy); CICYT/MCYT (Spain)","D.B.F., A.

Growth of graphene by chemical vapour deposition on Cu foils(4-7) has emerged as a powerful technique owing to its compatibility with industrial-scale roll-to-roll technology(6). However, the polycrystalline nature and microscopic roughness of Cu foils means that such roll-to-roll transferred films are not devoid of cracks and folds(6,7). High-fidelity transfer or direct growth of high-quality graphene films on arbitrary substrates is needed to enable wide-ranging applications in photonics or electronics, which include devices such as optoelectronic modulators, transistors, on-chip biosensors and tunnelling barriers(3,8,9). The direct growth of graphene film on an insulating substrate, such as a SiO2/Si wafer, would be useful for this purpose, but current research efforts remain grounded at the proof-of-concept stage, where only discontinuous, nanometre-sized islands can be obtained(10). Here we develop a face-to-face transfer method for wafer-scale graphene films that is so far the only known way to accomplish both the growth and transfer steps on one wafer. This spontaneous transfer method relies on nascent gas bubbles and capillary bridges between the graphene film and the underlying substrate during etching of the metal catalyst, which is analogous to the method used by tree frogs to remain attached to submerged leaves(11,12). In contrast to the previous wet(4,5,13-15) or dry(6,7) transfer results, the face-to-face transfer does not have to be done by hand and is compatible with any size and shape of substrate; this approach also enjoys the benefit of a much reduced density of transfer defects compared with the conventional transfer method. Most importantly, the direct growth and spontaneous attachment of graphene on the underlying substrate is amenable to batch processing in a semiconductor production line, and thus will speed up the technological application of graphene.","[Gao, Libo; Ni, Guang-Xin; Liu, Bo; Castro Neto, Antonio H.; Loh, Kian Ping] Natl Univ Singapore, Graphene Res Ctr, Singapore 117546, Singapore; [Gao, Libo; Liu, Yanpeng; Liu, Bo; Loh, Kian Ping] Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Chem, Singapore 117543, Singapore; [Ni, Guang-Xin; Castro Neto, Antonio H.] Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Phys, Singapore 117542, Singapore","Loh, KP (reprint author), Natl Univ Singapore, Graphene Res Ctr, 6 Sci Dr 2, Singapore 117546, Singapore.",chmlohkp@nus.edu.sg,"Castro Neto, Antonio/C-8363-2014; Gao, Libo/G-5928-2015; Ni, Guangxin/A-1341-2016; Loh, Kian Ping/M-3122-2016","Castro Neto, Antonio/0000-0003-0613-4010; Gao, Libo/0000-0002-7822-9812; Ni, Guangxin/0000-0002-2394-8924; Loh, Kian Ping/0000-0002-1491-743X",MOE Tier 2 grant 'Interface engineering of graphene hybrids for energy conversion' [R-143-000-488-112]; NRF-CRP grant 'Novel 2D materials with tailored properties: beyond graphene' [R-144-000-295-281],We thank C.

Solid-electrode batteries maintain discharge at peak power for far too short a time to fully regulate wind or solar power output(1,2). In contrast, flow batteries can independently scale the power (electrode area) and energy (arbitrarily large storage volume) components of the system by maintaining all of the electro-active species in fluid form(3-5). Wide-scale utilization of flow batteries is, however, limited by the abundance and cost of these materials, particularly those using redox-active metals and precious-metal electrocatalysts(6,7). Here we describe a class of energy storage materials that exploits the favourable chemical and electro-chemical properties of a family of molecules known as quinones. The example we demonstrate is ametal-free flow battery based on the redox chemistry of 9,10-anthraquinone-2,7-disulphonic acid (AQDS). AQDS undergoes extremely rapid and reversible two-electron two-proton reduction on a glassy carbon electrode in sulphuric acid. An aqueous flow battery with inexpensive carbon electrodes, combining the quinone/hydroquinone couple with the Br-2/Br- redox couple, yields a peak galvanic power density exceeding 0.6 W cm(-2) at 1.3 A cm(-2). Cycling of this quinone-bromide flow battery showed >99 per cent storage capacity retention per cycle. The organic anthraquinone species can be synthesized from inexpensive commodity chemicals(8). This organic approach permits tuning of important properties such as the reduction potential and solubility by adding functional groups: for example, we demonstrate that the addition of two hydroxy groups to AQDS increases the open circuit potential of the cell by 11% and we describe a pathway for further increases in cell voltage. The use of p-aromatic redox-active organic molecules instead of redox-active metals represents a new and promising direction for realizing massive electrical energy storage at greatly reduced cost.","[Huskinson, Brian; Marshak, Michael P.; Gerhardt, Michael R.; Gordon, Roy G.; Aziz, Michael J.] Harvard Univ, Sch Engn & Appl Sci, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Marshak, Michael P.; Suh, Changwon; Er, Sueleyman; Galvin, Cooper J.; Chen, Xudong; Aspuru-Guzik, Alan; Gordon, Roy G.] Harvard Univ, Dept Chem & Chem Biol, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Er, Sueleyman] Eindhoven Univ Technol, NL-5600 MB Eindhoven, Netherlands","Aziz, MJ (reprint author), Harvard Univ, Sch Engn & Appl Sci, 29 Oxford St, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",maziz@harvard.edu,"Chen, Xudong/H-1520-2011; Marshak, Michael/N-3213-2013; Suh, Changwon/N-1297-2014; Er, Suleyman/G-4145-2011","Marshak, Michael/0000-0002-8027-2705; Er, Suleyman/0000-0002-5005-3894; Gerhardt, Michael/0000-0002-1272-3607",US Department of Energy ARPA-E Award [DE-AR0000348]; Harvard School of Engineering and Applied Sciences; Extreme Science and Engineering Discovery Environment (XSEDE); National Science Foundation [OCI-1053575]; NSF; Foundation for Fundamental Research on Matter (FOM); Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO),"This work was partially funded through US Department of Energy ARPA-E Award DE-AR0000348 and partially funded through the Harvard School of Engineering and Applied Sciences.

Ideal syntheses should use the least number of synthetic steps, with few or no functional group transformations and by-products, and maximum atom efficiency. One potentially attractive method for the synthesis of molecular skeletons that are difficult to prepare would be through the selective activation of C-H and C-C bonds(4-8), instead of the conventional construction of new C-C bonds. Here we present an approach that exploits the multifold reactivity of easily accessible substrates(9) with a single organometallic species to furnish complex molecular scaffolds through the merging of otherwise difficult transformations: allylic C-H and selective C-C bond activations(10-12). The resulting bifunctional nucleophilic species, all of which have an all-carbon quaternary stereogenic centre, can then be selectively derivatized by the addition of two different electrophiles to obtain more complex molecular architecture from these easily available starting materials.","[Masarwa, Ahmad; Didier, Dorian; Zabrodski, Tamar; Marek, Ilan] Technion Israel Inst Technol, Schulich Fac Chem, Mallat Family Lab Organ Chem, IL-32000 Haifa, Israel; [Masarwa, Ahmad; Didier, Dorian; Zabrodski, Tamar; Marek, Ilan] Technion Israel Inst Technol, Lise Meitner Minerva Ctr Computat Quantum Chem, IL-32000 Haifa, Israel; [Schinkel, Marvin; Ackermann, Lutz] Univ Gottingen, Inst Organ & Biomol Chem, D-37077 Gottingen, Germany","Marek, I (reprint author), Technion Israel Inst Technol, Schulich Fac Chem, Mallat Family Lab Organ Chem, IL-32000 Haifa, Israel.",chilanm@tx.technion.ac.il,"Ackermann, Lutz/C-8117-2014",,Niedersachsen-Technion Research Cooperation Program; Israel Science Foundation [140/12]; European Research Council under the European Community [338912],"This research was supported by the Niedersachsen-Technion Research Cooperation Program, by the Israel Science Foundation administrated by the Israel Academy of Sciences and Humanities (140/12) and by the European Research Council under the European Community's Seventh Framework Programme (ERC grant agreement no. 338912).

Despite the importance of these rocks, sampling them in situ is extremely challenging owing to the overlying dykes and lavas. This means that models for understanding the formation of the lower crust are based largely on geophysical studies(1) and ancient analogues (ophiolites)(2-5) that did not form at typical mid-ocean ridges. Here we describe cored intervals of primitive, modally layered gabbroic rocks from the lower plutonic crust formed at a fast-spreading ridge, sampled by the Integrated Ocean Drilling Program at the Hess Deep rift. Centimetre-scale, modally layered rocks, some of which have a strong layering-parallel foliation, confirm a long-held belief that such rocks are a key constituent of the lower oceanic crust formed at fast-spreading ridges(3,6). Geochemical analysis of these primitive lower plutonic rocks-in combination with previous geochemical data for shallow-level plutonic rocks, sheeted dykes and lavas-provides the most completely constrained estimate of the bulk composition of fast-spreading oceanic crust so far. Simple crystallization models using this bulk crustal composition as the parental melt accurately predict the bulk composition of both the lavas and the plutonic rocks. However, the recovered plutonic rocks show early crystallization of orthopyroxene, which is not predicted by current models of melt extraction from the mantle(7) and mid-ocean-ridge basalt differentiation(8,9). The simplest explanation of this observation is that compositionally diverse melts are extracted from the mantle and partly crystallize before mixing to produce the more homogeneous magmas that erupt.","[Gillis, Kathryn M.; Faak, Kathrin] Univ Victoria, Sch Earth & Ocean Sci, Victoria, BC V8W 2Y2, Canada; [Snow, Jonathan E.] Univ Houston, Houston, TX 77204 USA; [Klaus, Adam] Texas A&M Univ, Integrated Ocean Drilling Program, US Implementing Org, College Stn, TX 77845 USA; [Abe, Natsue] Japan Agcy Marine Earth Sci & Technol, Inst Res Earth Evolut, Yokosuka, Kanagawa 2370061, Japan; [Adriao, Alden B.] Univ Fed Rio Grande do Sul, Inst Geosci, BR-91501970 Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil; [Akizawa, Norikatsu; Machi, Sumiaki] Kanazawa Univ, Dept Earth Sci, Kanazawa, Ishikawa 9201192, Japan; [Ceuleneer, Georges] Univ Toulouse 3, CNRS, UMS 831, Observ Midipyrenees, F-31400 Toulouse, France; [Cheadle, Michael J.; John, Barbara E.] Univ Wyoming, Dept 3006, Dept Geol & Geophys, Laramie, WY 82071 USA; [Faak, Kathrin] Ruhr Univ Bochum, Inst Geol Mineral & Geophys, D-44780 Bochum, Germany; [Falloon, Trevor J.] Univ Tasmania, Inst Marine & Antarctic Studies, Hobart, Tas, Australia; [Falloon, Trevor J.] Univ Tasmania, Sch Earth Sci, Hobart, Tas, Australia; [Friedman, Sarah A.] So Illinois Univ, Dept Geol, Carbondale, IL 62901 USA; [Godard, Marguerite; Ildefonse, Benoit] Univ Montpellier 2, CNRS UMR5243, Geosci Montpellier, CC 60, F-34095 Montpellier 5, France; [Guerin, Gilles] Columbia Univ, Lamont Doherty Earth Observ, Borehole Res Grp, Palisades, NY USA; [Harigane, Yumiko] Geol Survey Japan, Natl Inst Adv Ind Sci & Technol, Inst Geol & Geoinformat, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058567, Japan; [Horst, Andrew J.] Oberlin Coll, Dept Geol, Oberlin, OH 44074 USA; [Hoshide, Takashi] Tohoku Univ, Grad Sch Sci, Aoba Ku, Sendai, Miyagi 9808578, Japan; [Jean, Marlon M.] No Illinois Univ, Dept Geol & Environm, De Kalb, IL 60115 USA; [Koepke, Juergen] Leibniz Univ Hannover, Inst Mineral, D-30167 Hannover, Germany; [Maeda, Jinichiro; Python, Marie] Hokkaido Univ, Dept Nat Hist Sci, Kita Ku, Sapporo, Hokkaido 0600810, Japan; [Marks, Naomi E.] Lawrence Livermore Natl Lab, Chem & Mat Sci Dept, Livermore, CA 94551 USA; [McCaig, Andrew M.] Univ Leeds, Sch Earth & Environm, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England; [Meyer, Romain] Univ Bergen, Ctr Geobiol, N-5007 Bergen, Norway; [Meyer, Romain] Univ Bergen, Dept Earth Sci, N-5007 Bergen, Norway; [Morris, Antony] Univ Plymouth, Sch Geog Earth & Environm Sci, Plymouth PL4 8AA, Devon, England; [Nozaka, Toshio] Okayama Univ, Dept Earth Sci, Okayama 7008530, Japan; [Saha, Abhishek] Univ Calcutta, Dept Geol, Kolkata 700019, India; [Wintsch, Robert P.] Indiana Univ, Dept Geol Sci, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA","Gillis, KM (reprint author), Univ Victoria, Sch Earth & Ocean Sci, POB 1700 Stn CSC, Victoria, BC V8W 2Y2, Canada.",kgillis@uvic.ca,"Godard, Marguerite/A-7127-2008; Snow, Jonathan/E-5591-2011; ildefonse, benoit/A-6205-2009; NOZAKA, Toshio/B-2096-2011","Godard, Marguerite/0000-0003-3097-5135; ildefonse, benoit/0000-0001-7635-9288; McCaig, Andrew/0000-0001-7416-4911; Morris, Antony/0000-0003-2862-7377",,,,45,25,27,3,94,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,9-Jan,2014,505,7482,,,,,204,+,,10.1038/nature12778,,8,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,286CG,WOS:000329441500036,24291793,No,,,11/20/17

ELEGANS; SELECTION; GENOTYPE; ROLES,"The development of a multicellular organism and physiological responses require massive coordinated changes in gene expression across several cell and tissue types(1-3). Polymorphic regions of the genome that influence gene expression levels have been identified by expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) mapping in many species(4-6), including loci that have cell-dependent(7,8), tissue-dependent(9) and age-dependent(10) effects. However, there has been no comprehensive characterization of how polymorphisms influence the complex dynamic patterns of gene expression that occur during development and in physiology. Here we describe an efficient experimental design to infer gene expression dynamics from single expression profiles in different genotypes, and apply it to characterize the effect of local (cis) and distant (trans) genetic variation on gene expression at high temporal resolution throughout a 12-hour period of the development of Caenorhabditis elegans. Taking dynamic variation into account identifies >50% more cis-eQTLs, including more than 900 that alter the dynamics of expression during this period. Local sequence polymorphisms extensively affect the timing, rate, magnitude and shape of expression changes. Indeed, many local sequence variants both increase and decrease gene expression, depending on the time-point profiled. Expression dynamics during this 12-hour period are also influenced extensively in trans by distal loci. In particular, several trans loci influence genes with quite diverse dynamic expression patterns, but they do so primarily during a common time interval. Trans loci can therefore act as modifiers of expression during a particular period of development. This study provides the first characterization, to our knowledge, of the effect of local and distant genetic variation on the dynamics of gene expression throughout an extensive time period. Moreover, the approach developed here should facilitate the genetic dissection of other dynamic processes, including potentially development, physiology and disease progression in humans.","[Francesconi, Mirko; Lehner, Ben] Ctr Genom Regulat CRG, EMBL CRG Syst Biol Unit, Barcelona 08003, Spain; [Francesconi, Mirko; Lehner, Ben] UPF, Barcelona 08003, Spain; [Lehner, Ben] ICREA, Barcelona 08010, Spain","Lehner, B (reprint author), Ctr Genom Regulat CRG, EMBL CRG Syst Biol Unit, Dr Aiguader 88, Barcelona 08003, Spain.",ben.lehner@crg.eu,"Lehner, Ben/L-3413-2014; francesconi, mirko/O-8080-2015","Lehner, Ben/0000-0002-8817-1124; francesconi, mirko/0000-0002-8702-0877","ERASysBio + ERANET 'GRAPPLE'; ERC; MICINN [BFU2008-00365, BFU2011-26206]; AGAUR; EMBO; EU [277899]; EMBL-CRG Systems Biology Program; ICREA","This work was funded by ERASysBio + ERANET 'GRAPPLE', an ERC Starting Grant, MICINN BFU2008-00365 and BFU2011-26206, AGAUR, the EMBO Young Investigator Program, EU Framework 7 project 277899 4DCellFate, and by the EMBL-CRG Systems Biology Program.

As the majority of patients present with invasive, metastatic disease(2), it is vital to understand the basis for lung cancer progression. Hmga2 is highly expressed in metastatic lung adenocarcinoma, in which it contributes to cancer progression and metastasis(3-6). Here we show that Hmga2 promotes lung cancer progression in mouse and human cells by operating as a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA)(7-11) for the let-7 microRNA (miRNA) family. Hmga2 can promote the transformation of lung cancer cells independent of protein-coding function but dependent upon the presence of let-7 sites; this occurs without changes in the levels of let-7 isoforms, suggesting that Hmga2 affects let-7 activity by altering miRNA targeting. These effects are also observed in vivo, where Hmga2 ceRNA activity drives lung cancer growth, invasion and dissemination. Integrated analysis of miRNA target prediction algorithms and metastatic lung cancer gene expression data reveals the TGF-beta co-receptor Tgfbr3 (ref. 12) as a putative target of Hmga2 ceRNA function. Tgfbr3 expression is regulated by the Hmga2 ceRNA through differential recruitment to Argonaute 2 (Ago2), and TGF-beta signalling driven by Tgfbr3 is important for Hmga2 to promote lung cancer progression. Finally, analysis of NSCLC-patient gene-expression data reveals that HMGA2 and TGFBR3 are coordinately regulated in NSCLC-patient material, a vital corollary to ceRNA function. Taken together, these results suggest that Hmga2 promotes lung carcinogenesis both as a protein-coding gene and as a non-coding RNA; such dual-function regulation of gene-expression networks reflects a novel means by which oncogenes promote disease progression.","[Kumar, Madhu S.; Armenteros-Monterroso, Elena; Downward, Julian] Canc Res UK London Res Inst, Signal Transduct Lab, London WC2A 3LY, England; [East, Philip; Chakravorty, Probir] Canc Res UK London Res Inst, Bioinformat & Biostat Grp, London WC2A 3LY, England; [Matthews, Nik] Canc Res UK London Res Inst, Adv Sequencing Facil, London WC2A 3LY, England; [Winslow, Monte M.] Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Stanford Canc Inst, Dept Genet,Dept Pathol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Downward, Julian] Inst Canc Res, Div Canc Biol, Lung Canc Grp, London SW3 6JB, England","Downward, J (reprint author), Canc Res UK London Res Inst, Signal Transduct Lab, 44 Lincolns Inn Fields, London WC2A 3LY, England.",julian.downward@cancer.org.uk,,,Cancer Research UK; European Commission [259770],We thank the laboratory of T.

At its initial peripheral infection site in the distal lung airways, M. tuberculosis infects macrophages, which transport it to deeper tissues(1). How mycobacteria survive in these broadly microbicidal cells is an important question. Here we show in mice and zebrafish that M. tuberculosis, and its close pathogenic relative Mycobacterium marinum, preferentially recruit and infect permissive macrophages while evading microbicidal ones. This immune evasion is accomplished by using cell-surface-associated phthiocerol dimycoceroserate (PDIM) lipids(2) to mask underlying pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). In the absence of PDIM, these PAMPs signal a Toll-like receptor (TLR)-dependent recruitment of macrophages that produce microbicidal reactive nitrogen species. Concordantly, the related phenolic glycolipids (PGLs)(2) promote the recruitment of permissive macrophages through a host chemokine receptor 2 (CCR2)-mediated pathway. Thus, we have identified coordinated roles for PDIM, known to be essential for mycobacterial virulence(3), and PGL, which (along with CCR2) is known to be associated with human tuberculosis(4,5). Our findings also suggest an explanation for the longstanding observation that M. tuberculosis initiates infection in the relatively sterile environment of the lower respiratory tract, rather than in the upper respiratory tract, where resident microflora and inhaled environmental microbes may continually recruit microbicidal macrophages through TLR-dependent signalling.","[Cambier, C.

At present, no effective treatment options are available, and little is known about the complex cellular response to TBI during its acute phase. To gain insights into TBI pathogenesis, we developed a novel murine closed-skull brain injury model that mirrors some pathological features associated with mild TBI in humans and used long-term intravital microscopy to study the dynamics of the injury response from its inception. Here we demonstrate that acute brain injury induces vascular damage, meningeal cell death, and the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) that ultimately breach the glial limitans and promote spread of the injury into the parenchyma. In response, the brain elicits a neuroprotective, purinergic-receptor-dependent inflammatory response characterized by meningeal neutrophil swarming and microglial reconstitution of the damaged glial limitans. We also show that the skull bone is permeable to small-molecular-weight compounds, and use this delivery route to modulate inflammation and therapeutically ameliorate brain injury through transcranial administration of the ROS scavenger, glutathione.

Here we report a crystal structure of the Vif-CBF-beta-CUL5-ELOB-ELOC complex. The structure reveals that Vif, by means of two domains, organizes formation of the pentameric complex by interacting with CBF-beta, CUL5 and ELOC. The larger domain (alpha/beta domain) of Vif binds to the same side of CBF-beta as RUNX1, indicating that Vif and RUNX1 are exclusive for CBF-beta binding. Interactions of the smaller domain (alpha-domain) of Vif with ELOCand CUL5 are cooperative and mimic those of SOCS2 with the latter two proteins. A unique zinc-finger motif of Vif, which is located between the two Vif domains, makes no contacts with the other proteins but stabilizes the conformation of the alpha-domain, which may be important for Vif-CUL5 interaction. Together, our data reveal the structural basis for Vif hijacking of the CBF-beta and CUL5 E3 ligase complex, laying a foundation for rational design of novel anti-HIV drugs.","[Guo, Yingying; Dong, Liyong; Qiu, Xiaolin; Wang, Yishu; Zhang, Bailing; Liu, Hongnan; Zang, Yi; Huang, Zhiwei] Harbin Inst Technol, Sch Life Sci & Technol, Harbin 150080, Peoples R China; [Yu, You; Yang, Maojun] Tsinghua Univ, Sch Life Sci, Tsinghua Peking Ctr Life Sci, MOE Key Lab Prot Sci, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China","Huang, ZW (reprint author), Harbin Inst Technol, Sch Life Sci & Technol, Harbin 150080, Peoples R China.",huangzhiwei@hit.edu.cn,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [31300605, 31030020, 31170679]; Program for New Century Excellent Talents in University [AUGA5710060713]; Ministry of Science and Technology of China [2012CB911101, 2011CB910502]","We thank F.

One such restriction factor, SAMHD1, inhibits human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 infection ofmyeloid-lineage cells(1,2) as well as resting CD4(+) T cells(3,4) by reducing the cellular deoxynucleoside 5'-triphosphate (dNTP) concentration to a level at which the viral reverse transcriptase cannot function(5,6). In other lentiviruses, including HIV-2 and related simian immunodeficiency viruses (SIVs), SAMHD1 restriction is overcome by the action of viral accessory protein x (Vpx) or the related viral protein r (Vpr) that target and recruit SAMHD1 for proteasomal degradation(7,8). The molecular mechanism by which these viral proteins are able to usurp the host cell's ubiquitination machinery to destroy the cell's protection against these viruses has not been defined. Here we present the crystal structure of a ternary complex of Vpx with the human E3 ligase substrate adaptor DCAF1 and the carboxy-terminal region of human SAMHD1. Vpx is made up of a three-helical bundle stabilized by a zinc finger motif, and wraps tightly around the disc-shaped DCAF1 molecule to present a new molecular surface. This adapted surface is then able to recruit SAMHD1 via its C terminus, making it a competent substrate for the E3 ligase to mark for proteasomal degradation. The structure reported here provides a molecular description of how a lentiviral accessory protein is able to subvert the cell's normal protein degradation pathway to inactivate the cellular viral defence system.","[Schwefel, David; Christodoulou, Evangelos; Walker, Philip A.; Taylor, Ian A.] Natl Inst Med Res, MRC, Div Mol Struct, London NW7 1AA, England; [Groom, Harriet C.

The full potential of brown macroalgae as feedstocks for commercial-scale fuel ethanol production, however, requires extensive re-engineering of the alginate and mannitol catabolic pathways(1-3) in the standard industrial microbe Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Here we present the discovery of an alginate monomer (4-deoxy-L-erythro-5-hexoseulose uronate, or DEHU) transporter from the alginolytic eukaryote Asteromyces cruciatus(4). The genomic integration and overexpression of the gene encoding this transporter, together with the necessary bacterial alginate and deregulated native mannitol catabolism genes, conferred the ability of an S. cerevisiae strain to efficiently metabolize DEHU and mannitol. When this platform was further adapted to grow on mannitol and DEHU under anaerobic conditions, it was capable of ethanol fermentation from mannitol and DEHU, achieving titres of 4.6%(v/v) (36.2 g l(-1)) and yields up to 83% of the maximum theoretical yield from consumed sugars. These results show that all major sugars in brown macroalgae can be used as feedstocks for biofuels and value-added renewable chemicals in a manner that is comparable to traditional arable-land-based feedstocks.","[Enquist-Newman, Maria; Faust, Ann Marie E.; Bravo, Daniel D.; Santos, Christine Nicole S.; Raisner, Ryan M.; Hanel, Arthur; Sarvabhowman, Preethi; Le, Chi; Regitsky, Drew D.; Cooper, Susan R.; Clark, Alana; Martinez, Yessica; Goldsmith, Joshua; Cho, Min Y.; Donohoue, Paul D.; Luo, Lily; Lamberson, Brigit; Tamrakar, Pramila; Kim, Edward J.; Villari, Jeffrey L.; Gill, Avinash; Tripathi, Shital A.; Karamchedu, Padma; Paredes, Carlos J.; Rajgarhia, Vineet; Bailey, Richard B.; Ohler, Nicholas L.; Swimmer, Candace; Yoshikuni, Yasuo] Bio Architecture Lab Inc, Berkeley, CA 94710 USA; [Peereboom, Lars; Miller, Dennis J.] Michigan State Univ, Dept Chem Engn & Mat Sci, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Kotlar, Hans Kristian] Statoil ASA, Statoil Res Ctr, N-7005 Trondheim, Norway; [Yoshikuni, Yasuo] BALChile SA, Santiago 7550000, Chile; [Yoshikuni, Yasuo] BAL Biofuels SA, Santiago 7550000, Chile","Yoshikuni, Y (reprint author), Bio Architecture Lab Inc, 604 Bancroft Way,Suite A, Berkeley, CA 94710 USA.",candacesw@yahoo.com; yoshikuni@ba-lab.com,,,DOE under an Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy (ARPA-E) award [DE-AR0000006]; CORFO INNOVA CHILE [09CTEI-6866]; Statoil ASA; agency of the US government,"We thank R.

X-ray free-electron lasers (FELs) provide extremely intense pulses of femtosecond duration, which allow data collection from nanometre- to micrometre-sized crystals(1-4) in a 'diffraction-before-destruction' approach. So far, all protein structure determinations carried out using FELs have been based on previous knowledge of related, known structures(1-5). Here we show that X-ray FEL data can be used for de novo protein structure determination, that is, without previous knowledge about the structure. Using the emerging technique of serial femtosecond crystallography(1-4,6), we performed single-wavelength anomalous scattering measurements on microcrystals of the well-established model system lysozyme, in complex with a lanthanide compound. Using Monte-Carlo integration(6,7), we obtained high-quality diffraction intensities from which experimental phases could be determined, resulting in an experimental electron density map good enough for automated building of the protein structure. This demonstrates the feasibility of determining novel protein structures using FELs. We anticipate that serial femtosecond crystallography will become an important tool for the structure determination of proteins that are difficult to crystallize, such as membrane proteins(1,2,8).","[Barends, Thomas R.

Despite decades of research attempting to narrow uncertainties, equilibrium climate sensitivity estimates from climate models still span roughly 1.5 to 5 degrees Celsius for a doubling of atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration, precluding accurate projections of future climate. The spread arises largely from differences in the feedback from low clouds, for reasons not yet understood. Here we show that differences in the simulated strength of convective mixing between the lower and middle tropical troposphere explain about half of the variance in climate sensitivity estimated by 43 climate models. The apparent mechanism is that such mixing dehydrates the low-cloud layer at a rate that increases as the climate warms, and this rate of increase depends on the initial mixing strength, linking the mixing to cloud feedback. The mixing inferred from observations appears to be sufficiently strong to imply a climate sensitivity of more than 3 degrees for a doubling of carbon dioxide. This is significantly higher than the currently accepted lower bound of 1.5 degrees, thereby constraining model projections towards relatively severe future warming.","[Sherwood, Steven C.] Univ New S Wales, Climate Change Res Ctr, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia; [Sherwood, Steven C.] Univ New S Wales, ARC Ctr Excellence Climate Syst Sci, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia; [Bony, Sandrine; Dufresne, Jean-Louis] Univ Paris 06, CNRS, Meteorol Dynam Lab, F-75252 Paris, France; [Bony, Sandrine; Dufresne, Jean-Louis] Univ Paris 06, CNRS, Inst Pierre Simon Laplace LMD IPSL, F-75252 Paris, France","Sherwood, SC (reprint author), Univ New S Wales, Climate Change Res Ctr, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia.",s.sherwood@unsw.edu.au,"Dufresne, Jean-Louis/I-5616-2015; Sherwood, Steven/B-5673-2008","Dufresne, Jean-Louis/0000-0003-4764-9600; Sherwood, Steven/0000-0001-7420-8216; Bony, Sandrine/0000-0002-4791-4438",FP7-ENV-2009-1 European project EUCLIPSE [244067],"This work was supported by the FP7-ENV-2009-1 European project EUCLIPSE (number 244067).

To monitor the spread of artemisinin resistance, a molecular marker is urgently needed. Here, using whole-genome sequencing of an artemisinin-resistant parasite line from Africa and clinical parasite isolates from Cambodia, we associate mutations in the PF3D7_1343700 kelch propeller domain ('K13-propeller') with artemisinin resistance in vitro and in vivo. Mutant K13-propeller alleles cluster in Cambodian provinces where resistance is prevalent, and the increasing frequency of a dominant mutant K13-propeller allele correlates with the recent spread of resistance in western Cambodia. Strong correlations between the presence of a mutant allele, in vitro parasite survival rates and in vivo parasite clearance rates indicate that K13-propeller mutations are important determinants of artemisinin resistance. K13-propeller polymorphism constitutes a useful molecular marker for large-scale surveillance efforts to contain artemisinin resistance in the Greater Mekong Subregion and prevent its global spread.","[Ariey, Frederic; Beghain, Johann; Langlois, Anne-Claire; Fandeur, Thierry; Barale, Jean-Christophe; Mercereau-Puijalon, Odile] Inst Pasteur, Parasite Mol Immunol Unit, F-75724 Paris 15, France; [Ariey, Frederic; Beghain, Johann; Langlois, Anne-Claire; Barale, Jean-Christophe; Mercereau-Puijalon, Odile] CNRS, URA 2581, F-75724 Paris 15, France; [Witkowski, Benoit; Khim, Nimol; Kim, Saorin; Duru, Valentine; Lim, Pharath; Fandeur, Thierry; Menard, Didier] Inst Pasteur Cambodge, Malaria Mol Epidemiol Unit, Phnom Penh, Cambodia; [Amaratunga, Chanaki; Lim, Pharath; Fairhurst, Rick M.] NIAID, Lab Malaria & Vector Res, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Bouchier, Christiane; Ma, Laurence] Inst Pasteur, Dept Genomes & Genet, F-75724 Paris 15, France; [Lim, Pharath; Leang, Rithea; Duong, Socheat; Sreng, Sokunthea; Suon, Seila; Chuor, Char Meng] Natl Ctr Parasitol Entomol & Malaria Control, Phnom Penh, Cambodia; [Bout, Denis Mey] Natl Ctr Parasitol Entomol & Malaria Control, SSA WHO, Phnom Penh, Cambodia; [Menard, Sandie; Berry, Antoine] Ctr Hosp Univ Toulouse, Serv Parasitol & Mycol, F-31059 Toulouse 9, France; [Rogers, William O.] Naval Med Res Unit 2 Detachment, Phnom Penh, Cambodia; [Genton, Blaise] Swiss Trop & Publ Hlth Inst, CH-4051 Basel, Switzerland; [Miotto, Olivo] Univ Oxford, MRC, Ctr Genom & Global Hlth, Oxford OX3 7BN, England; [Miotto, Olivo] Mahidol Univ, Mahidol Oxford Trop Med Res Unit, Bangkok 10400, Thailand; [Miotto, Olivo] Wellcome Trust Sanger Inst, Cambridge CB10 1SA, England; [Ringwald, Pascal] WHO, Global Malaria Program, CH-1211 Geneva, Switzerland; [Le Bras, Jacques] CHU Bichat Claude Bernard, APHP, PRES Sorbonne Paris Cite, Ctr Natl Reference Paludisme, F-75018 Paris, France; [Benoit-Vical, Franoise] CNRS, Lab Chim Coordinat, UPR8241, F-31077 Toulouse 4, France; [Benoit-Vical, Franoise] Univ Toulouse, UPS, Inst Natl Polytech Toulouse, F-31077 Toulouse 4, France","Ariey, F (reprint author), Inst Pasteur, Genet & Genom Insect Vectors Unit, F-75724 Paris 15, France.",frederic.ariey@pasteur.fr; rfairhurst@niaid.nih.gov; Francoise.Vical@inserm.fr; odile.puijalon@pasteur.fr; dmenard@pasteur-kh.org,"Berry, Antoine/J-9352-2014; Benoit-Vical, Francoise/E-3938-2016; ariey, frederic/P-1185-2017","Benoit-Vical, Francoise/0000-0002-9468-4823; ariey, frederic/0000-0002-0680-1090; Miotto, Olivo/0000-0001-8060-6771; Menard, Didier/0000-0003-1357-4495; Lim, Pharath/0000-0002-1012-2461","Global Fund Grant Malaria Program [CAM-607-G10M-CNM3, CAM-S10-G14-M]; Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation; USAID (through the World Health Organization); US DOD Global Epidemic Information System; Intramural Research Program, NIAID, NIH; Banque Natixis; Laboratoire d'Excellence IBEID (Agence Nationale de la Recherche, France); Institut Pasteur, Division International [ACIP A-10-2010]; Institut Pasteur, Division International; French Ministry of Foreign Affairs; Wellcome Trust [098051, 090770/Z/09/Z]; MRC [G0600718]; Rotary Club-Versailles","We thank the patients and field staff involved in clinical trials and sample collections.

How Ca-V channels solve this fundamental biophysical problem remains unclear. Here we report physiological and crystallographic analyses of a calcium selectivity filter constructed in the homotetrameric bacterial Na-V channel Na(V)Ab. Our results reveal interactions of hydrated Ca2+ with two high-affinity Ca2+-binding sites followed by a third lower-affinity site that would coordinate Ca2+ as it moves inward. At the selectivity filter entry, Site 1 is formed by four carboxyl side chains, which have a critical role in determining Ca2+ selectivity. Four carboxyls plus four backbone carbonyls form Site 2, which is targeted by the blocking cations Cd2+ and Mn2+, with single occupancy. The lower-affinity Site 3 is formed by four backbone carbonyls alone, which mediate exit into the central cavity. This pore architecture suggests a conduction pathway involving transitions between two main states with one or two hydrated Ca2+ ions bound in the selectivity filter and supports a 'knock-off' mechanism of ion permeation through a stepwise-binding process. The multi-ion selectivity filter of our Ca(V)Ab model establishes a structural framework for understanding the mechanisms of ion selectivity and conductance by vertebrate Ca-V channels.","[Tang, Lin; El-Din, Tamer M.

The heated crust has been thought to affect observable phenomena at shallower depths, such as thermonuclear bursts in the accreted envelope(10,11). Here we report that cycles of electron capture and its inverse, beta(-) decay, involving neutron-rich nuclei at a typical depth of about 150 metres, cool the outer neutron star crust by emitting neutrinos while also thermally decoupling the surface layers from the deeper crust. This 'Urca' mechanism(12) has been studied in the context of white dwarfs(13) and type Ia supernovae(14,15), but hitherto was not considered in neutron stars, because previous models(1,2) computed the crust reactions using a zero-temperature approximation and assumed that only a single nuclear species was present at any given depth. The thermal decoupling means that X-ray bursts and other surface phenomena are largely independent of the strength of deep crustal heating. The unexpectedly short recurrence times, of the order of years, observed for very energetic thermonuclear superbursts(16) are therefore not an indicator of a hot crust, but may point instead to an unknown local heating mechanism near the neutron star surface.","[Schatz, H.; Brown, E.

Previous observations(1-3) have indicated that its atmosphere has a ratio of methane to carbon monoxide that is 10(5) times smaller than predicted by models for hydrogen-dominated atmospheres at these temperatures(4,5). A recent study proposed that this unusual chemistry could be explained if the planet's atmosphere is significantly enhanced in elements heavier than hydrogen and helium(6). Here we report observations of GJ 436b's atmosphere obtained during transit. The data indicate that the planet's transmission spectrum is featureless, ruling out cloud-free, hydrogen-dominated atmosphere models with an extremely high significance of 48 sigma. The measured spectrum is consistent with either a layer of high cloud located at a pressure level of approximately one millibar or with a relatively hydrogen-poor (three per cent hydrogen and helium mass fraction) atmospheric composition(7-9).","[Knutson, Heather A.; Benneke, Bjoern] CALTECH, Div Geol & Planetary Sci, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA; [Benneke, Bjoern] MIT, Dept Earth Atmospher & Planetary Sci, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Deming, Drake] Univ Maryland, Dept Astron, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Homeier, Derek] Ctr Rech Astrophys Lyon, F-69364 Lyon, France","Knutson, HA (reprint author), CALTECH, Div Geol & Planetary Sci, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA.",hknutson@caltech.edu,,"Homeier, Derek/0000-0002-8546-9128",European Research Council under the European Community [247060],"We thank P.

Atmospheric studies are the next step towards developing a comprehensive understanding of this new class of object(4-6). Much effort has been focused on using transmission spectroscopy to characterize the atmosphere of the super-Earth archetype GJ 1214b (refs 7-17), but previous observations did not have sufficient precision to distinguish between two interpretations for the atmosphere. The planet's atmosphere could be dominated by relatively heavy molecules, such as water (for example, a 100 per cent water vapour composition), or it could contain high-altitude clouds that obscure its lower layers. Here we report a measurement of the transmission spectrum of GJ 1214b at near-infrared wavelengths that definitively resolves this ambiguity. The data, obtained with the Hubble Space Telescope, are sufficiently precise to detect absorption features from a high mean-molecular-mass atmosphere. The observed spectrum, however, is featureless. We rule out cloud-free atmospheric models with compositions dominated by water, methane, carbon monoxide, nitrogen or carbon dioxide at greater than 5 sigma confidence.

But although the crystallization of atoms is fairly well understood(1,2), it remains challenging to predict reliably the outcome of molecular crystallization processes that are complicated by various molecular interactions and solvent involvement. This difficulty also applies to nanoparticles: high-quality three-dimensional crystals(3-6) are mostly produced using drying and sedimentation techniques that are often impossible to rationalize and control to give a desired crystal symmetry, lattice spacing and habit (crystal shape). In principle, DNA-mediated assembly of nanoparticles offers an ideal opportunity for studying nanoparticle crystallization(7-17): a well-defined set of rules have been developed to target desired lattice symmetries and lattice constants(8,9,18), and the occurrence of features such as grain boundaries and twinning in DNA superlattices and traditional crystals comprised of molecular or atomic building blocks suggests that similar principles govern their crystallization. But the presence of charged biomolecules, interparticle spacings of tens of nanometres, and the realization so far of only polycrystalline DNA-interconnected nanoparticle superlattices, all suggest that DNA-guided crystallization may differ from traditional crystal growth. Here we show that very slow cooling, over several days, of solutions of complementary-DNA-modified nanoparticles through the melting temperature of the system gives the thermodynamic product with a specific and uniform crystal habit. We find that our nanoparticle assemblies have the Wulff equilibrium crystal structure that is predicted from theoretical considerations and molecular dynamics simulations, thus establishing that DNA hybridization can direct nanoparticle assembly along a pathway that mimics atomic crystallization.","[Auyeung, Evelyn; Li, Ting I.

Primary production in the NPSG has increased in recent decades despite a reduction in nutrient supply to surface waters(2,3). It is thought that this apparent paradox can be explained by a shift in plankton community structure from mostly eukaryotes to mostly nitrogen-fixing prokaryotes(2-4). It remains uncertain, however, whether the plankton community domain shift can be linked to cyclical climate variability or a long-term global warming trend(5). Here we analyse records of bulk and amino-acid-specific N-15/N-14 isotopic ratios (delta N-15) preserved in the skeletons of long-lived deep-sea proteinaceous corals collected from the Hawaiian archipelago; these isotopic records serve as a proxy for the source of nitrogen-supported export production through time. We find that the recent increase in nitrogen fixation is the continuation of a much larger, centennial-scale trend. After a millennium of relatively minor fluctuation, delta N-15 decreases between 1850 and the present. The total shift in delta N-15 of -2 per mil over this period is comparable to the total change in global mean sedimentary delta N-15 across the Pleistocene-Holocene transition, but it is happening an order of magnitude faster(6). We use a steady-state model and find that the isotopic mass balance between nitrate and nitrogen fixation implies a 17 to 27 per cent increase in nitrogen fixation over this time period. A comparison with independent records(7,8) suggests that the increase in nitrogen fixation might be linked to Northern Hemisphere climate change since the end of the Little Ice Age.","[Sherwood, Owen A.; Guilderson, Thomas P.; Batista, Fabian C.; Schiff, John T.; McCarthy, Matthew D.] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Ocean Sci Dept, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA; [Guilderson, Thomas P.] Lawrence Livermore Natl Lab, Livermore, CA 94550 USA; [Guilderson, Thomas P.] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Inst Marine Sci, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA","Sherwood, OA (reprint author), Univ Colorado, Inst Arctic & Alpine Res, Boulder, CO 80309 USA.",owen.sherwood@colorado.edu,,,NOAA/NURP; National Geographic Society [7717-04]; US Department of Energy [DE-AC52-07NA27344]; NSF [OCE 1061689],We thank the captain and crew of the RV Ka'imikai-o-Kanaloa and the pilots and engineers of the Hawaiian Undersea Research Laboratory's Pisces V submersible for their assistance in collecting the specimens presented here.

Here we show that the impacts of nitrogen: phosphorus stoichiometry on plant species richness can be explained by selected plant life-history traits, notably by plant investments in growth versus reproduction. In 599 Eurasian sites with herbaceous vegetation we examined the relationship between the local nutrient conditions and community-mean life-history traits. We found that compared with plants in nitrogen-limited communities, plants in phosphorus-limited communities invest little in sexual reproduction (for example, less investment in seed, shorter flowering period, longer lifespan) and have conservative leaf economy traits (that is, a low specific leaf area and a high leaf dry-matter content). Endangered species were more frequent in phosphorus-limited ecosystems and they too invested little in sexual reproduction. The results provide new insight into how plant adaptations to nutrient conditions can drive the distribution of plant species in natural ecosystems and can account for the vulnerability of endangered species.","[Fujita, Yuki] KWR Watercycle Res Inst, NL-3430 BB Nieuwegein, Netherlands; [Venterink, Harry Olde] Vrije Univ Brussel, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium; [van Bodegom, Peter M.] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Dept Ecol Sci, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Douma, Jacob C.] Wageningen Univ, Ctr Crop Syst Anal, NL-6708 PB Wageningen, Netherlands; [Heil, Gerrit W.] Univ Utrecht, Fac Sci, NL-3584 CC Utrecht, Netherlands; [Hoelzel, Norbert] Univ Munster, Fac Geosci, Inst Landscape Ecol, D-48149 Munster, Germany; [Jablonska, Ewa; Kotowski, Wiktor; Pawlikowski, Pawel] Univ Warsaw, Inst Bot, Dept Plant Ecol & Environm Conservat, Warsaw, Poland; [Okruszko, Tomasz] Warsaw Univ Life Sci, Fac Civil & Environm Engn, PL-02722 Warsaw, Poland; [de Ruiter, Peter C.] Wageningen Univ, NL-6700 AC Wageningen, Netherlands; [Wassen, Martin J.] Univ Utrecht, Copernicus Inst Sustainable Dev, Fac Geosci, NL-3508 TC Utrecht, Netherlands","Wassen, MJ (reprint author), Univ Utrecht, Copernicus Inst Sustainable Dev, Fac Geosci, POB 80115, NL-3508 TC Utrecht, Netherlands.",m.j.wassen@uu.nl,"Douma, Jacob C./C-9721-2014; Wassen, Martin/L-9228-2013; olde Venterink, Harry/K-9547-2015; van Bodegom, Peter/N-8150-2015; Holzel, Norbert/H-8753-2013","Douma, Jacob C./0000-0002-8779-838X; Wassen, Martin/0000-0002-9735-2103; olde Venterink, Harry/0000-0002-8963-1153; van Bodegom, Peter/0000-0003-0771-4500; ",Utrecht Centre of Geosciences; Polish Ministry of Science and Higher Education [N304 010 31/0414],"We would like to thank N.

Although Native Americans seem to be genetically most closely related to east Asians(1-3), there is no consensus with regard to which specific Old World populations they are closest to(4-8). Here we sequence the draft genome of an approximately 24,000-year-old individual (MA-1), from Mal'ta in south-central Siberia(9), to an average depth of 1x. To our knowledge this is the oldest anatomically modern human genome reported to date. The MA-1 mitochondrial genome belongs to haplogroup U, which has also been found at high frequency among Upper Palaeolithic and Mesolithic European hunter-gatherers(10-12), and the Y chromosome of MA-1 is basal to modern-day western Eurasians and near the root of most Native American lineages(5). Similarly, we find autosomal evidence that MA-1 is basal to modern-day western Eurasians and genetically closely related to modern-day Native Americans, with no close affinity to east Asians. This suggests that populations related to contemporary western Eurasians had a more north-easterly distribution 24,000 years ago than commonly thought. Furthermore, we estimate that 14 to 38% of Native American ancestry may originate through gene flow from this ancient population. This is likely to have occurred after the divergence of Native American ancestors from east Asian ancestors, but before the diversification of Native American populations in the New World. Gene flow from the MA-1 lineage into Native American ancestors could explain why several crania from the First Americans have been reported as bearing morphological characteristics that do not resemble those of east Asians(2,13). Sequencing of another south-central Siberian, Afontova Gora-2 dating to approximately 17,000 years ago(14), revealed similar autosomal genetic signatures as MA-1, suggesting that the region was continuously occupied by humans throughout the Last Glacial Maximum. Our findings reveal that western Eurasian genetic signatures in modern-day Native Americans derive not only from post-Columbian admixture, as commonly thought, but also from a mixed ancestry of the First Americans.","[Raghavan, Maanasa; Stafford, Thomas W., Jr.; Orlando, Ludovic; Campos, Paula F.; Willerslev, Eske] Univ Copenhagen, Nat Hist Museum Denmark, Ctr GeoGenet, DK-1350 Copenhagen, Denmark; [Skoglund, Pontus; Jakobsson, Mattias] Uppsala Univ, Dept Evolutionary Biol, S-75236 Uppsala, Sweden; [Graf, Kelly E.] Texas A&M Univ, Ctr Study Amer 1, College Stn, TX 77845 USA; [Metspalu, Mait; Karmin, Monika; Tambets, Kristiina; Rootsi, Siiri; Litvinov, Sergey; Kivisild, Toomas; Villems, Richard] Estonian Bioctr, Evolutionary Biol Grp, EE-51010 Tartu, Estonia; [Metspalu, Mait; DeGiorgio, Michael; Nielsen, Rasmus] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Integrat Biol, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Metspalu, Mait; Metspalu, Ene; Karmin, Monika; Villems, Richard] Univ Tartu, Dept Evolutionary Biol, EE-51010 Tartu, Estonia; [Albrechtsen, Anders; Moltke, Ida] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Biol, Bioinformat Ctr, DK-2200 Copenhagen, Denmark; [Moltke, Ida] Univ Chicago, Dept Human Genet, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Rasmussen, Simon] Tech Univ Denmark, Ctr Biol Sequence Anal, DK-2800 Lyngby, Denmark; [Stafford, Thomas W., Jr.] Univ Aarhus, Dept Phys & Astron, AMS Dating Ctr 14C, DK-8000 Aarhus, Denmark; [Maegi, Reedik] Univ Tartu, Estonian Genome Ctr, EE-51010 Tartu, Estonia; [Balanovska, Elena; Balanovsky, Oleg] Russian Acad Med Sci, Res Ctr Med Genet, Moscow 115479, Russia; [Balanovsky, Oleg] Russian Acad Sci, Vavilov Inst Gen Genet, Moscow 119991, Russia; [Khusnutdinova, Elza; Litvinov, Sergey] Russian Acad Sci, Ufa Sci Ctr, Inst Biochem & Genet, Ufa 450054, Bashkorostan, Russia; [Khusnutdinova, Elza] Bashkir State Univ, Biol Dept, Ufa 450054, Bashkorostan, Russia; [Osipova, Ludmila P.; Voevoda, Mikhail I.] Russian Acad Sci, Siberian Branch, Ctr Brain Neurobiol & Neurogenet, Inst Cytol & Genet, Novosibirsk 630090, Russia; [Fedorova, Sardana A.] Russian Acad Med Sci, Yakut Res Ctr Complex Med Problems, Dept Mol Genet, Sakha 677010, Yakutia, Russia; [Fedorova, Sardana A.] North Eastern Fed Univ, Sakha 677010, Yakutia, Russia; [Voevoda, Mikhail I.] North Eastern Fed Univ, Sakha 677010, Yakutia, Russia; [Sicheritz-Ponten, Thomas; Brunak, Soren] Tech Univ Denmark, Novo Nordisk Fdn Ctr Biosustainabil, DK-2800 Lyngby, Denmark; [Demeshchenko, Svetlana] State Hermitage Museum, St Petersburg 190000, Russia; [Kivisild, Toomas] Univ Cambridge, Dept Biol Anthropol, Cambridge CB2 1QH, England; [Villems, Richard] Estonian Acad Sci, EE-10130 Tallinn, Estonia; [Jakobsson, Mattias] Uppsala Univ, Sci Life Lab, S-75236 Uppsala, Sweden","Willerslev, E (reprint author), Univ Copenhagen, Nat Hist Museum Denmark, Ctr GeoGenet, Oster Voldgade 5-7, DK-1350 Copenhagen, Denmark.",ewillerslev@snm.ku.dk,"; Fedorova, Sardana/K-5445-2017; Jakobsson, Mattias/A-6116-2011; Campos, Paula/B-1634-2010; Orlando, Ludovic/A-8932-2013; Kivisild, Toomas/P-5889-2017; Balanovsky, Oleg/G-1549-2014; Albrechtsen, Anders/K-4281-2013; Osipova, Ludmila/O-6480-2014; Metspalu, Mait/G-8671-2015; Moltke, Ida/C-6158-2011; Litvinov, Sergey/L-1738-2013; Rasmussen, Simon/G-6258-2016; Khusnutdinova, Elza/A-4810-2013","Brunak, Soren/0000-0003-0316-5866; Karmin, Monika/0000-0001-9827-5579; Skoglund, Pontus/0000-0002-3021-5913; Raghavan, Maanasa/0000-0003-1997-0739; Magi, Reedik/0000-0002-2964-6011; Gotovtsev, Nyurgun/0000-0002-4710-1592; Nielsen, Rasmus/0000-0003-0513-6591; Jakobsson, Mattias/0000-0001-7840-7853; Campos, Paula/0000-0003-1285-4671; Orlando, Ludovic/0000-0003-3936-1850; Kivisild, Toomas/0000-0002-6297-7808; Albrechtsen, Anders/0000-0001-7306-031X; Osipova, Ludmila/0000-0001-7602-1156; Metspalu, Mait/0000-0003-3099-9161; Moltke, Ida/0000-0001-7052-8554; Rasmussen, Simon/0000-0001-6323-9041; Khusnutdinova, Elza/0000-0003-2987-3334","Danish National Research Foundation; Lundbeck Foundation; Arctic Social Sciences Program, National Science Foundation [PLR-1003725]; European Regional Development Fund (European Union) through the Centre of Excellence in Genomics to Estonian Biocentre; University of Tartu and Estonian Basic Research grant [SF0270177As08]; Estonian Science Foundation [8973]; Baltic-American Freedom Foundation Research Scholarship program; Government of Russian Federation [14.B25.31.0033]; US National Science Foundation [DBI-1103639]; Swedish National Infrastructure for Computing (SNIC-UPPMAX) [b2012063]","We thank the Hermitage State Museum for providing access to the Mal'ta and Afontova Gora-2 human remains.

Incortical areas, synchronization of principal-neuron spiking activity is an effective mechanism for information coding that is regulated by GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid)-ergic interneurons through the generation of neuronal oscillations(4,5). Although neuronal synchrony has been demonstrated to be crucial for sensory, motor and cognitive processing(6-8), it has not been investigated at the level of defined circuits involved in the control of emotional behaviour. Converging evidence indicates that fear behaviour is regulated by the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex(9-12) (dmPFC). This control over fear behaviour relies on the activation of specific prefrontal projections to the basolateral complex of the amygdala (BLA), a structure that encodes associative fear memories(13-15). However, it remains to be established how the precise temporal control of fear behaviour is achieved at the level of prefrontal circuits. Here we use single-unit recordings and optogenetic manipulations in behaving mice to show that fear expression is causally related to the phasic inhibition of prefrontal parvalbumin interneurons (PVINs). Inhibition of PVIN activity disinhibits prefrontal projection neurons and synchronizes their firing by resetting local theta oscillations, leading to fear expression. Our results identify two complementary neuronal mechanisms mediated by PVINs that precisely coordinate and enhance the neuronal activity of prefrontal projection neurons to drive fear expression.","[Courtin, Julien; Chaudun, Fabrice; Rozeske, Robert R.; Karalis, Nikolaos; Gonzalez-Campo, Cecilia; Wurtz, Helene; Bienvenu, Thomas C.

The mechanism by which hepatic niche cells differentially modulate regeneration and fibrosis during liver repair remains to be defined(6-8). Hepatic vascular niche predominantly represented by liver sinusoidal endothelial cells deploys paracrine trophogens, known as angiocrine factors, to stimulate regeneration(9-15). Nevertheless, it is not known how pro-regenerative angiocrine signals from liver sinusoidal endothelial cells is subverted to promote fibrosis(16,17). Here, by combining an inducible endothelial-cell-specific mouse gene deletion strategy and complementary models of acute and chronic liver injury, we show that divergent angiocrine signals from liver sinusoidal endothelial cells stimulate regeneration after immediate injury and provoke fibrosis after chronic insult. The pro-fibrotic transition of vascular niche results from differential expression of stromal-derived factor-1 receptors, CXCR7 and CXCR4 (refs 18-21), in liver sinusoidal endothelial cells. After acute injury, CXCR7 upregulation in liver sinusoidal endothelial cells acts with CXCR4 to induce transcription factor Id1, deploying pro-regenerative angiocrine factors and triggering regeneration. Inducible deletion of Cxcr7 in sinusoidal endothelial cells (Cxcr7(i Delta EC/i Delta EC)) from the adult mouse liver impaired liver regeneration by diminishing Id1-mediated production of angiocrine factors(9-11). By contrast, after chronic injury inflicted by iterative hepatotoxin (carbon tetrachloride) injection and bile duct ligation, constitutive FGFR1 signalling in liver sinusoidal endothelial cells counterbalanced CXCR7-dependent pro-regenerative response and augmented CXCR4 expression. This predominance of CXCR4 over CXCR7 expression shifted angiocrine response of liver sinusoidal endothelial cells, stimulating proliferation of desmin(+) hepatic stellate-like cells(22,23) and enforcing apro-fibrotic vascular niche. Endothelial-cell-specific ablation of either Fgfr1 (Fgfr1(i Delta EC/i Delta EC)) or Cxcr4 (Cxcr4(i Delta EC/i Delta EC)) in mice restored the pro-regenerative pathway and prevented FGFR1-mediated maladaptive subversion of angiocrine factors. Similarly, selective CXCR7 activation in liver sinusoidal endothelial cells abrogated fibrogenesis. Thus, we demonstrate that in response to liver injury, differential recruitment of pro-regenerative CXCR7-Id1 versus pro-fibrotic FGFR1-CXCR4 angiocrine pathways in vascular niche balances regeneration and fibrosis. These results provide a therapeutic roadmap to achieve hepatic regeneration without provoking fibrosis(1,2,4).","[Ding, Bi-Sen; Cao, Zhongwei; Lis, Raphael; Nolan, Daniel J.; Guo, Peipei; Shido, Koji; Rabbany, Sina Y.; Rafii, Shahin] Weill Cornell Med Coll, Ansary Stem Cell Inst, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Dept Med Genet, New York, NY 10065 USA; [Nolan, Daniel J.] Angiocrine Biosci, New York, NY 10065 USA; [Simons, Michael] Yale Univ, Sch Med, Yale Cardiovasc Res Ctr, New Haven, CT 06510 USA; [Penfold, Mark E.] ChemoCentryx Inc, Mountain View, CA 94043 USA; [Rabbany, Sina Y.] Hofstra Univ, Bioengn Program, Hempstead, NY 11549 USA","Rafii, S (reprint author), Weill Cornell Med Coll, Ansary Stem Cell Inst, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Dept Med Genet, New York, NY 10065 USA.",bid2004@med.cornell.edu; srafii@med.cornell.edu,"Simons, Michael/G-8553-2014","Simons, Michael/0000-0003-0348-7734","National Scientist Development Grant from the American Heart Association [12SDG1213004]; New York Stem Cell Foundation; Ansary Stem Cell Institute; Howard Hughes Medical Institute; Empire State Stem Cell Board; New York State Department of Health [C024180, C026438, C026878, C028117]; National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute [R01HL097797, R01HL119872, RC2HL101846, R01 HL053793]; National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases [R01DK095039]; National Cancer Institute [U54CA163167]; Qatar National Priorities Research Foundation [NPRP08-663-3-140]; Qatar Foundation; Tri-Institutional Weill Cornell Starr Stem Cell Scholar Program","We are grateful to T.

C-type lectins of the RegIII family are bactericidal proteins that limit direct contact between bacteria and the intestinal epithelium and thus promote tolerance to the intestinal microbiota(1,2). RegIII lectins recognize their bacterial targets by binding peptidoglycan carbohydrate(1,3), but the mechanism by which they kill bacteria is unknown. Here we elucidate the mechanistic basis for RegIII bactericidal activity. We show that human RegIII alpha (also known as HIP/PAP) binds membrane phospholipids and kills bacteria by forming a hexameric membrane-permeabilizing oligomeric pore. We derive a three-dimensional model of the RegIII alpha pore by docking the RegIII alpha crystal structure into a cryo-electron microscopic map of the pore complex, and show that the model accords with experimentally determined properties of the pore. Lipopolysaccharide inhibits RegIII alpha pore-forming activity, explaining why RegIII alpha is bactericidal for Gram-positive but not Gram-negative bacteria. Our findings identify C-type lectins as mediators of membrane attack in the mucosal immune system, and provide detailed insight into an antibacterial mechanism that promotes mutualism with the resident microbiota.","[Mukherjee, Sohini; Derebe, Mehabaw G.; Rollins, Darcy; Propheter, Daniel C.; Hooper, Lora V.] Univ Texas SW Med Ctr Dallas, Dept Immunol, Dallas, TX 75390 USA; [Zheng, Hui; Jiang, Qiu-Xing] Univ Texas SW Med Ctr Dallas, Dept Cell Biol, Dallas, TX 75390 USA; [Callenberg, Keith M.; Grabe, Michael] Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Biol Sci, Pittsburgh, PA 15261 USA; [Callenberg, Keith M.; Grabe, Michael] Univ Pittsburgh, PhD Program Computat Biol, Joint Carnegie Mellon Univ, Pittsburgh, PA 15261 USA; [Partch, Carrie L.] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Chem & Biochem, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA; [Rizo, Josep] Univ Texas SW Med Ctr Dallas, Dept Biochem, Dallas, TX 75390 USA; [Rizo, Josep] Univ Texas SW Med Ctr Dallas, Dept Pharmacol, Dallas, TX 75390 USA; [Hooper, Lora V.] Univ Texas SW Med Ctr Dallas, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Dallas, TX 75390 USA","Hooper, LV (reprint author), Univ Texas SW Med Ctr Dallas, Dept Immunol, Dallas, TX 75390 USA.",qiu-xing.jiang@utsouthwestern.edu; lora.hooper@utsouthwestern.edu,,,"NIH [R01 DK070855, R01GM088745, GM093271, R01 NS40944, C06 RR30414]; Welch Foundation [I-1684]; NSF CAREER [MCB0845286]; Helen Hay Whitney Fellowship; Burroughs Wellcome Foundation New Investigators in the Pathogenesis of Infectious Diseases Award; Howard Hughes Medical Institute","We thank T.

Despite this, BoNT/A is used to treat a wide range of common medical conditions such as migraines and a variety of ocular motility and movement disorders(2). BoNT/A is probably best known for its use as an antiwrinkle agent in cosmetic applications (including Botox and Dysport)(3). BoNT/A application causes long-lasting flaccid paralysis of muscles through inhibiting the release of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine by cleaving synaptosomal-associated protein 25 (SNAP-25) within presynaptic nerve terminals(4). Two types of BoNT/A receptor have been identified, both of which are required for BoNT/A toxicity and are therefore likely to cooperate with each other(5): gangliosides and members of the synaptic vesicle glycoprotein 2 (SV2) family, which are putative transporter proteins that are predicted to have 12 transmembrane domains, associate with the receptor-binding domain of the toxin(5). Recently, fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) has also been reported to be a potential BoNT/A receptor(6). In SV2 proteins, the BoNT/A-binding site has been mapped to the luminal domain(7), but the molecular details of the interaction between BoNT/A and SV2 are unknown. Here we determined the high-resolution crystal structure of the BoNT/A receptor-binding domain (BoNT/A-RBD) in complex with the SV2C luminal domain (SV2C-LD). SV2C-LD consists of a right-handed, quadrilateral beta-helix that associates with BoNT/A-RBD mainly through backbone-to-backbone interactions at open beta-strand edges, in a manner that resembles the inter-strand interactions in amyloid structures. Competition experiments identified a peptide that inhibits the formation of the complex. Our findings provide a strong platform for the development of novel antitoxin agents and for the rational design of BoNT/A variants with improved therapeutic properties.","[Benoit, Roger M.; Frey, Daniel; Hilbert, Manuel; Wieser, Mara M.; Jaussi, Rolf; Steinmetz, Michel O.; Schertler, Gebhard F.

Nuclear export is a key, irreversible step in pre-ribosome maturation(4-8), but mechanisms underlying the timely acquisition of export competence remain poorly understood. Here we show that a conserved Saccharomyces cerevisiae GTPase Nug2 (also known as Nog2, and as NGP-1, GNL2 or nucleostemin 2 in human(9)) has a key role in the timing of export competence. Nug2 binds the inter-subunit face of maturing, nucleoplasmic pre-60S particles, and the location clashes with the position of Nmd3, a key pre-60S export adaptor(10). Nug2 and Nmd3 are not present on the same pre-60S particles, with Nug2 binding before Nmd3. Depletion of Nug2 causes premature Nmd3 binding to the pre-60S particles, whereas mutations in the G-domain of Nug2 block Nmd3 recruitment, resulting in severe 60S export defects. Two pre-60S remodelling factors, the Rea1 ATPase and its co-substrate Rsa4, are present on Nug2-associated particles, and both show synthetic lethal interactions with nug2 mutants. Release of Nug2 from pre-60S particles requires both its K+-dependent GTPase activity and the remodelling ATPase activity of Rea1. We conclude that Nug2 is a regulatory GTPase that monitors pre-60S maturation, with release from its placeholder site linked to recruitment of the nuclear export machinery.","[Matsuo, Yoshitaka; Thoms, Matthias; Manikas, Rizos-Georgios; Hurt, Ed] Heidelberg Univ, Zentrum Biochem, D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany; [Granneman, Sander; Tollervey, David] Univ Edinburgh, Wellcome Trust Ctr Cell Biol, Edinburgh EH9 3JR, Midlothian, Scotland; [Granneman, Sander] Univ Edinburgh, Ctr Synthet & Syst Biol, Edinburgh EH9 3JD, Midlothian, Scotland","Hurt, E (reprint author), Heidelberg Univ, Zentrum Biochem, Neuenheimer Feld 328, D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany.",ed.hurt@bzh.uni.heidelberg.de,"Granneman, Sander/A-3150-2015","Granneman, Sander/0000-0003-4387-1271",Alexander von Humboldt Foundation; Wellcome Trust [077248]; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft [DFG Hu363/10-4],"We thank M.

Although essential to cell viability and development(3-5), the exact role of m(6)A modification remains to be determined. The recent discovery of two m(6)A demethylases in mammalian cells highlighted the importance of m(6)A in basic biological functions and disease(6-8). Here we show that m(6)A is selectively recognized by the human YTH domain family 2 (YTHDF2) 'reader' protein to regulate mRNA degradation. We identified over 3,000 cellular RNA targets of YTHDF2, most of which are mRNAs, but which also include non-coding RNAs, with a conserved core motif of G(m(6)A)C. We further establish the role of YTHDF2 in RNA metabolism, showing that binding of YTHDF2 results in the localization of bound mRNA from the translatable pool to mRNA decay sites, such as processing bodies(9). The carboxy-terminal domain of YTHDF2 selectively binds to m(6)A-containing mRNA, whereas the amino-terminal domain is responsible for the localization of the YTHDF2-mRNA complex to cellular RNA decay sites. Our results indicate that the dynamic m(6)A modification is recognized by selectively binding proteins to affect the translation status and lifetime of mRNA.","[Wang, Xiao; Lu, Zhike; Gomez, Adrian; Yue, Yanan; Han, Dali; Fu, Ye; Dai, Qing; Jia, Guifang; He, Chuan] Univ Chicago, Dept Chem, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Wang, Xiao; Lu, Zhike; Gomez, Adrian; Yue, Yanan; Han, Dali; Fu, Ye; Parisien, Marc; Dai, Qing; Jia, Guifang; Pan, Tao; He, Chuan] Univ Chicago, Inst Biophys Dynam, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Hon, Gary C.; Ren, Bing] Univ Calif San Diego, Sch Med, Ludwig Inst Canc Res, Dept Cellular & Mol Med,UCSD Moores Canc Ctr, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Hon, Gary C.; Ren, Bing] Univ Calif San Diego, Sch Med, Inst Genome Med, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Parisien, Marc; Pan, Tao] Univ Chicago, Dept Biochem & Mol Biol, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Jia, Guifang] Peking Univ, Dept Chem Biol, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China; [Jia, Guifang] Peking Univ, Synthet & Funct Biomol Ctr, Coll Chem & Mol Engn, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China","He, C (reprint author), Univ Chicago, Dept Chem, 929 East 57th St, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.",chuanhe@uchicago.edu,"han, dali/I-4145-2016","Parisien, Marc/0000-0003-2924-5960",National Institutes of Health [GM071440]; EUREKA [GM088599]; National Science Foundation [CHE-1048528],"This work is supported by National Institutes of Health GM071440 (C.

Recently, microglial cells have been shown to be responsible for a portion of synaptic pruning, but the remaining mechanisms remain unknown. Here we report a new role for astrocytes in actively engulfing central nervous system synapses. This process helps to mediate synapse elimination, requires the MEGF10 and MERTK phagocytic pathways, and is strongly dependent on neuronal activity. Developing mice deficient in both astrocyte pathways fail to refine their retinogeniculate connections normally and retain excess functional synapses. Finally, we show that in the adult mouse brain, astrocytes continuously engulf both excitatory and inhibitory synapses. These studies reveal a novel role for astrocytes in mediating synapse elimination in the developing and adult brain, identify MEGF10 and MERTK as critical proteins in the synapse remodelling underlying neural circuit refinement, and have important implications for understanding learning and memory as well as neurological disease processes.","[Chung, Won-Suk; Clarke, Laura E.; Chakraborty, Chandrani; Joung, Julia; Barres, Ben A.] Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Dept Neurobiol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Wang, Gordon X.; Smith, Stephen J.] Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Dept Mol & Cellular Physiol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Stafford, Benjamin K.] Univ Michigan, Dept Ophthalmol & Visual Sci, Ann Arbor, MI 48105 USA; [Sher, Alexander] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Santa Cruz Inst Particle Phys, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA; [Sher, Alexander] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Phys, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA; [Foo, Lynette C.] ASTAR, Inst Mol & Cell Biol, Singapore 138673, Singapore; [Thompson, Andrew; Chen, Chinfei] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Childrens Hosp, Boston, MA 02115 USA","Chung, WS (reprint author), Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Dept Neurobiol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",wschung@stanford.edu,"Chung, Won Suck/B-9011-2016",,"NIH [NS069375, 5 R21NS072556]; Damon Runyon Cancer Research Foundation [DRG 2020-09]; EMBO ALTF fellowship; Mcknight Foundation","We thank D.

Here we report the characterization of a dominant SL-insensitive rice (Oryza sativa) mutant dwarf 53 (d53) and the cloning of D53, which encodes a substrate of the SCFD3 ubiquitination complex and functions as a repressor of SL signalling. Treatments with GR24, a synthetic SL analogue, cause D53 degradation via the proteasome in a manner that requires D14 and the SCFD3 ubiquitin ligase, whereas the dominant form of D53 is resistant to SL-mediated degradation.

Despite the rapid progress in elucidating the SL biosynthetic pathway, the perception and signalling mechanisms of SL remain poorly understood. Here we show that DWARF 53 (D53) acts as a repressor of SL signalling and that SLs induce its degradation. We find that the rice (Oryza sativa) d53 mutant, which produces an exaggerated number of tillers compared to wild-type plants, is caused by a gain-of-function mutation and is insensitive to exogenous SL treatment. The D53 gene product shares predicted features with the class I Clp ATPase proteins and can form a complex with the a/b hydrolase protein DWARF 14 (D14) and the F-box protein DWARF 3 (D3), two previously identified signalling components potentially responsible for SL perception. We demonstrate that, in a D14- and D3-dependent manner, SLs induce D53 degradation by the proteasome and abrogate its activity in promoting axillary bud outgrowth. Our combined genetic and biochemical data reveal that D53 acts as a repressor of the SL signalling pathway, whose hormone-induced degradation represents a key molecular link between SL perception and responses.","[Zhou, Feng; Zhu, Lihong; Zhou, Kunneng; Gao, He; Yang, Chao; Jiang, Ling; Liu, Xi; Wan, Jianmin] Nanjing Agr Univ, Jiangsu Plant Gene Engn Res Ctr, Natl Key Lab Crop Genet & Germplasm Enhancement, Nanjing 210095, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Zhou, Feng; Lin, Qibing; Ren, Yulong; Wu, Fuqing; Dong, Wei; Gan, Lu; Ma, Weiwei; Chen, Jun; Wang, Dan; Tan, Junjie; Zhang, Xin; Guo, Xiuping; Wang, Jiulin; Cheng, Zhijun; Wang, Jie; Lei, Cailin; Zhai, Huqu; Wu, Chuanyin; Wang, Haiyang; Wan, Jianmin] Chinese Acad Agr Sci, Inst Crop Sci, Natl Key Facil Crop Gene Resources & Genet Improv, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China; [Shabek, Nitzan; Mao, Haibin; Zheng, Ning] Univ Washington, Dept Pharmacol, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Shabek, Nitzan; Mao, Haibin; Zheng, Ning] Univ Washington, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Chen, Weiqi; Chu, Jinfang; Yan, Cunyu] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Genet & Dev Biol, Natl Ctr Plant Gene Res Beijing, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Ueno, Kotomi; Ito, Shinsaku; Asami, Tadao] Univ Tokyo, Dept Appl Biol Chem, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo 1138657, Japan","Wan, JM (reprint author), Nanjing Agr Univ, Jiangsu Plant Gene Engn Res Ctr, Natl Key Lab Crop Genet & Germplasm Enhancement, Nanjing 210095, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",wanghaiyang@caas.cn; nzheng@u.washington.edu; wanjm@njau.edu.cn,,,"National Transgenic Science and Technology Program [2011ZX08009-003]; 863 National High-tech R&D Program of China [2012AA101100, 2012AA10A301]; Jiangsu Province 333 Program [BRA2012126]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [90917017]; National Science Foundation","We thank T.

However, the precise physical mechanism responsible for the acceleration on 9 October was not identified. Previous modelling has indicated that a magnetospheric electromagnetic emission known as chorus could be a potential candidate for local electron acceleration(6-10), but a definitive resolution of the importance of chorus for radiation-belt acceleration was not possible because of limitations in the energy range and resolution of previous electron observations and the lack of a dynamic global wave model. Here we report high-resolution electron observations(11) obtained during the 9 October storm and demonstrate, using a two-dimensional simulation performed with a recently developed time-varying data-driven model(12), that chorus scattering explains the temporal evolution of both the energy and angular distribution of the observed relativistic electron flux increase. Our detailed modelling demonstrates the remarkable efficiency of wave acceleration in the Earth's outer radiation belt, and the results presented have potential application to Jupiter, Saturn and other magnetized astrophysical objects.","[Thorne, R.

Introduction of controlled unitary processes-quantum gates-to a quantum system has so far been the most widely used method to create entanglement deterministically(2). These processes require high-fidelity state preparation and minimization of the decoherence that inevitably arises from coupling between the system and the environment, and imperfect control of the system parameters. Here we combine unitary processes with engineered dissipation to deterministically produce and stabilize an approximate Bell state of two trapped-ion quantum bits (qubits), independent of their initial states. Compared with previous studies that involved dissipative entanglement of atomic ensembles(3) or the application of sequences of multiple time-dependent gates to trapped ions(4), we implement our combined process using trapped-ion qubits in a continuous time-independent fashion (analogous to optical pumping of atomic states). By continuously driving the system towards the steady state, entanglement is stabilized even in the presence of experimental noise and decoherence. Our demonstration of an entangled steady state of two qubits represents a step towards dissipative state engineering, dissipative quantum computation and dissipative phase transitions(5-7). Following this approach, engineered coupling to the environment may be applied to a broad range of experimental systems to achieve desired quantum dynamics or steady states. Indeed, concurrently with this work, an entangled steady state of two superconducting qubits was demonstrated using dissipation(8).","[Lin, Y.; Gaebler, J. P.; Tan, T.

The first step is to stabilize a non-equilibrium state of a simple quantum system, such as a quantum bit (qubit) or a cavity mode, in the presence of decoherence. This has recently been accomplished using measurement-based feedback schemes(2-5). The next step is to prepare and stabilize a state of a composite system(6-8). Here we demonstrate the stabilization of an entangled Bell state of a quantum register of two superconducting qubits for an arbitrary time. Our result is achieved using an autonomous feedback scheme that combines continuous drives along with a specifically engineered coupling between the two-qubit register and a dissipative reservoir. Similar autonomous feedback techniques have been used for qubit reset(9), single-qubit state stabilization(10), and the creation(11) and stabilization(6) of states of multipartite quantum systems. Unlike conventional, measurement-based schemes, the autonomous approach uses engineered dissipation to counteract decoherence(12-15), obviating the need for a complicated external feedback loop to correct errors. Instead, the feedback loop is built into the Hamiltonian such that the steady state of the system in the presence of drives and dissipation is a Bell state, an essential building block for quantum information processing. Such autonomous schemes, which are broadly applicable to a variety of physical systems, as demonstrated by the accompanying paper on trapped ion qubits(16), will be an essential tool for the implementation of quantum error correction.","[Shankar, S.; Hatridge, M.; Leghtas, Z.; Sliwa, K.

However, the effect of cooling during the Late Cenozoic era, including the onset of Pliocene-Pleistocene Northern Hemisphere glaciation (about two to three million years ago), on global erosion rates remains unclear(1-4). The uncertainty arises mainly from a lack of consensus on the use of the sedimentary record as a proxy for erosion(3,4) and the difficulty of isolating the respective contributions of tectonics and climate to erosion(5-7). Here we compile 18,000 bedrock thermochronometric ages from around the world and use a formal inversion procedure(8) to estimate temporal and spatial variations in erosion rates. This allows for the quantification of erosion for the source areas that ultimately produce the sediment record on a timescale of millions of years. We find that mountain erosion rates have increased since about six million years ago and most rapidly since two million years ago. The increase of erosion rates is observed at all latitudes, but is most pronounced in glaciated mountain ranges, indicating that glacial processes played an important part. Because mountains represent a considerable fraction of the global production of sediments(9), our results imply an increase in sediment flux at a global scale that coincides closely with enhanced cooling during the Pliocene and Pleistocene epochs(10,11).","[Herman, Frederic; Valla, Pierre G.] Univ Lausanne, Inst Earth Sci, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland; [Herman, Frederic; Valla, Pierre G.; Willett, Sean D.] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Dept Earth Sci, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland; [Seward, Diane] Victoria Univ, Sch Geog Environm & Earth Sci, Wellington, New Zealand; [Carter, Andrew] Birkbeck Univ London, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, London WC1E 7HX, England; [Kohn, Barry] Univ Melbourne, Sch Earth Sci, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia; [Ehlers, Todd A.] Univ Tubingen, Dept Geosci, D-72074 Tubingen, Germany","Herman, F (reprint author), Univ Lausanne, Inst Earth Sci, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland.",frederic.herman@unil.ch,"Valla, Pierre/I-8525-2012; Willett, Sean/B-1716-2008; Ehlers, Todd/A-9582-2012; Carter, Andrew/C-1371-2008","Carter, Andrew/0000-0002-0090-5868; Kohn, Barry/0000-0001-5064-5454",SNF [PP00P2_138956],"We thank J.-D.

They are cited widely as a diagnostic feature(4) and figure prominently in clinical instruments(5); however, the early onset of these deficits has not been known. Here we show in a prospective longitudinal study that infants later diagnosed with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) exhibit mean decline in eye fixation from 2 to 6 months of age, a pattern not observed in infants who do not develop ASD. These observations mark the earliest known indicators of social disability in infancy, but also falsify a prior hypothesis: in the first months of life, this basic mechanism of social adaptive action-eye looking-is not immediately diminished in infants later diagnosed with ASD; instead, eye looking appears to begin at normative levels prior to decline. The timing of decline highlights a narrow developmental window and reveals the early derailment of processes that would otherwise have a key role in canalizing typical social development. Finally, the observation of this decline in eye fixation-rather than outright absence-offers a promising opportunity for early intervention that could build on the apparent preservation of mechanisms subserving reflexive initial orientation towards the eyes.","[Jones, Warren; Klin, Ami] Childrens Healthcare Atlanta, Marcus Autism Ctr, Atlanta, GA 30329 USA; [Jones, Warren; Klin, Ami] Emory Univ, Sch Med, Dept Pediat, Div Autism & Related Disabil, Atlanta, GA 30022 USA; [Jones, Warren; Klin, Ami] Emory Univ, Ctr Translat Social Neurosci, Atlanta, GA 30022 USA","Jones, W (reprint author), Childrens Healthcare Atlanta, Marcus Autism Ctr, Atlanta, GA 30329 USA.",warren.jones@emory.edu; ami.klin@emory.edu,,,Simons Foundation; National Institute of Mental Health [R01 MH083727]; Marcus Foundation; Whitehead Foundation; Georgia Research Alliance,"This work was supported by grants from the Simons Foundation and the National Institute of Mental Health (R01 MH083727).

The resulting exposure of blood to the atherosclerotic material then triggers thrombus formation, which occludes the artery(2). The importance of genetic predisposition to coronary artery disease and myocardial infarction is best documented by the predictive value of a positive family history(3). Nextgeneration sequencing in families with several affected individuals has revolutionized mutation identification(4). Here we report the segregation of two private, heterozygous mutations in two functionally relatedgenes, GUCY1A3 (p.Leu163Phefs*24) andCCT7 (p.Ser525Leu), in an extended myocardial infarction family. GUCY1A3 encodes the alpha 1 subunit of soluble guanylyl cyclase (alpha 1-sGC)(5), and CCT7 encodes CCT eta, a member of the tailless complex polypeptide 1 ring complex(6), which, among other functions, stabilizes soluble guanylyl cyclase. After stimulation with nitric oxide, soluble guanylyl cyclase generates cGMP, which induces vasodilation and inhibits platelet activation(7). Wedemonstratein vitro that mutations inbothGUCY1A3 and CCT7 severely reduce alpha 1-sGC as well as beta 1-sGC protein content, and impair soluble guanylyl cyclase activity. Moreover, platelets from digenic mutation carriers contained less soluble guanylyl cyclase protein and consequently displayed reduced nitric-oxideinduced cGMP formation. Mice deficient in alpha 1-sGC protein displayed accelerated thrombus formation in themicrocirculation after local trauma. Starting with a severely affected family, we have identified a link between impaired soluble-guanylyl-cyclase-dependent nitric oxide signalling and myocardial infarction risk, possibly through accelerated thrombus formation. Reversing this defect may provide a new therapeutic target for reducing the risk of myocardial infarction.","[Erdmann, Jeanette; Medack, Anja; Tennstedt, Stephanie; Aherrahrou, Zouhair; Nahrstaedt, Janja;

Glucokinase (GK), a key enzyme that regulates glucose homeostasis, converts glucose to glucose-6-phosphate(2,3) in pancreatic beta-cells, liver hepatocytes, specific hypothalamic neurons, and gut enterocytes(4). In hepatocytes, GK regulates glucose uptake and glycogen synthesis, suppresses glucose production(3,5), and is subject to the endogenous inhibitor GK regulatory protein (GKRP)(6-8). During fasting, GKRP binds, inactivates and sequesters GK in the nucleus, which removes GK from the gluconeogenic process and prevents a futile cycle of glucose phosphorylation. Compounds that directly hyperactivate GK (GK activators) lower blood glucose levels and are being evaluated clinically as potential therapeutics for the treatment of type II diabetes mellitus(1,9,10). However, initial reports indicate that an increased risk of hypoglycaemia is associated with some GK activators(11). To mitigate the risk of hypoglycaemia, we sought to increase GK activity by blocking GKRP. Here we describe the identification of two potent small-molecule GK-GKRP disruptors (AMG-1694 and AMG-3969) that normalized blood glucose levels in several rodent models of diabetes. These compounds potently reversed the inhibitory effect of GKRP on GK activity and promoted GK translocation both in vitro (isolated hepatocytes) and in vivo (liver). A co-crystal structure of full-length human GKRP in complex with AMG-1694 revealed a previously unknown binding pocket in GKRP distinct from that of the phosphofructose-binding site. Furthermore, with AMG-1694 and AMG-3969 (but not GK activators), blood glucose lowering was restricted to diabetic and not normoglycaemic animals. These findings exploit a new cellular mechanism for lowering blood glucose levels with reduced potential for hypoglycaemic risk in patients with type II diabetes mellitus.","[Lloyd, David J.; Cupples, Rod; Chen, Michelle; Wu, John; Sivits, Glenn; Helmering, Joan; Komorowski, Renee; Wang, Minghan; Veniant, Murielle M.; Hale, Clarence] Amgen Inc, Dept Metab Disorders, Thousand Oaks, CA 91320 USA; [St Jean, David J., Jr.; Kurzeja, Robert J.

The repertoire is whittled down during T-cell development in the thymus by the ability of quasi-randomly generated TCRs to interact with selfpeptides presented by major histocompatibility complex (MHC) proteins. Low-affinity TCR interactions with self-MHC proteins generate weak signals that initiate 'positive selection', causing maturation of CD4- or CD8ab-expressing 'single-positive' thymocytes from CD4(+)CD8 alpha beta(+) 'double-positive' precursors(1). These develop into mature naive T cells of the secondary lymphoid organs. TCR interaction with high-affinity agonist self-ligands results in 'negative selection' by activation-induced apoptosis or 'agonist selection' of functionally differentiated self-antigen-experienced T cells(2,3). Here we show that positive selection is enabled by the ability of the T-cell-specific protein Themis(4-9) to specifically attenuate TCR signal strength via SHP1 recruitment and activation in response to low-but not high-affinity TCR engagement. Themis acts as an analog-to-digital converter translating graded TCR affinity into clear-cut selection outcome. By dampening mild TCR signals Themis increases the affinity threshold for activation, enabling positive selection of T cells with a naive phenotype in response to low-affinity self-antigens.","[Fu, Guo; Casas, Javier; Rigaud, Stephanie; Rybakin, Vasily; Brzostek, Joanna; Hoerter, John A.

Clostridia, a dominant class of commensal microbe, can induce colonic regulatory T (T-reg) cells, which have a central role in the suppression of inflammatory and allergic responses(3). However, the molecular mechanisms by which commensal microbes induce colonic T-reg cells have been unclear. Here we show that a large bowel microbial fermentation product, butyrate, induces the differentiation of colonic T-reg cells in mice. A comparative NMR-based metabolome analysis suggests that the luminal concentrations of short-chain fatty acids positively correlates with the number of T-reg cells in the colon. Among short-chain fatty acids, butyrate induced the differentiation of T-reg cells in vitro and in vivo, and ameliorated the development of colitis induced by adoptive transfer of CD4(+) CD45RB(hi) T cells in Rag1(-/-) mice. Treatment of naive T cells under the T-reg-cell-polarizing conditions with butyrate enhanced histone H3 acetylation in the promoter and conserved non-coding sequence regions of the Foxp3 locus, suggesting a possible mechanism for how microbial-derived butyrate regulates the differentiation of T-reg cells. Our findings provide new insight into the mechanisms by which host-microbe interactions establish immunological homeostasis in the gut.","[Furusawa, Yukihiro; Obata, Yuuki; Fukuda, Shinji; Endo, Takaho A.; Nakato, Gaku; Takahashi, Daisuke; Uetake, Chikako; Kato, Keiko; Kato, Tamotsu; Takahashi, Masumi; Miyauchi, Eiji; Atarashi, Koji; Onawa, Satoshi; Hori, Shohei; Ohara, Osamu; Koseki, Haruhiko; Honda, Kenya; Hase, Koji; Ohno, Hiroshi] RIKEN Ctr Integrat Med Sci IMS RCAI, Wako, Kanagawa 2300045, Japan; [Furusawa, Yukihiro; Obata, Yuuki; Fujimura, Yumiko; Hase, Koji] Univ Tokyo, Inst Med Sci, Tokyo 1088639, Japan; [Obata, Yuuki; Koseki, Haruhiko; Ohno, Hiroshi] Chiba Univ, Grad Sch Med, Chiba 2608670, Japan; [Fukuda, Shinji; Nakanishi, Yumiko; Fukuda, Noriko N.; Murakami, Shinnosuke; Tomita, Masaru] Keio Univ, Inst Adv Biosci, Yamagata 9970052, Japan; [Kato, Keiko; Koseki, Haruhiko; Kikuchi, Jun] Yokohama City Univ, Grad Sch Med Life Sci, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2300045, Japan; [Hino, Shingo] Shizuoka Univ, Fac Agr, Shizuoka 4228529, Japan; [Atarashi, Koji; Hase, Koji] Japan Sci & Technol Agcy, PRESTO, Kawaguchi, Saitama 3320012, Japan; [Lockett, Trevor; Clarke, Julie M.; Topping, David L.] CSIRO Food & Nutr Sci, Preventat Hlth Natl Res Flagship, Adelaide, SA 5000, Australia; [Kikuchi, Jun] RIKEN Ctr Sustainable Resource Sci, Kanagawa 2300045, Japan; [Honda, Kenya] Japan Sci & Technol Agcy, CREST, Kawaguchi, Saitama 3320012, Japan","Ohno, H (reprint author), RIKEN Ctr Integrat Med Sci IMS RCAI, Wako, Kanagawa 2300045, Japan.",sfukuda@sfc.keio.ac.jp; hase@ims.u-tokyo.ac.jp; ohno@rcai.riken.jp,"Ohara, Osamu/G-5448-2015; Honda, Kenya/N-5297-2015; Endo, Takaho/B-5763-2017; Lockett, Trevor/H-8970-2013; topping, david/H-7969-2013; Koseki, Haruhiko/I-3825-2014; Clarke, Julie/H-6762-2013; Ohno, Hiroshi/L-7899-2014; Kikuchi, Jun/M-5512-2015","Ohara, Osamu/0000-0002-3328-9571; Endo, Takaho/0000-0002-2801-2463; Lockett, Trevor/0000-0002-8063-071X; Obata, Yuuki/0000-0001-5461-3521; topping, david/0000-0002-8481-9384; Koseki, Haruhiko/0000-0001-8424-5854; Clarke, Julie/0000-0003-4676-0366; Ohno, Hiroshi/0000-0001-8776-9661; Kikuchi, Jun/0000-0002-6809-394X","Japanese Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology [24117524, 21022049, 20113003]; The Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [24890293, 252667, 24380072, 24658129, 22689017, 21390155]; The Japan Science and Technology Agency; RIKEN; RIKEN RCAI Young Chief Investigator program; Institute for Fermentation, Osaka; Mishima Kaiun Memorial Foundation; The Takeda Science Foundation; The Mitsubishi Foundation; The Uehara Memorial Foundation","We would like to thank P.

The delicate balance between pro-and anti-inflammatory mechanisms, essential for gut immune homeostasis, is affected by the composition of the commensal microbial community. Regulatory T cells (T-reg cells) expressing transcription factor Foxp3 have a key role in limiting inflammatory responses in the intestine(1). Although specific members of the commensal microbial community have been found to potentiate the generation of anti-inflammatory T-reg or pro-inflammatory T helper 17 (T(H)17) cells(2-6), the molecular cues driving this process remain elusive. Considering the vital metabolic function afforded by commensal microorganisms, we reasoned that their metabolic by-products are sensed by cells of the immune system and affect the balance between pro-and anti-inflammatory cells. We tested this hypothesis by exploring the effect of microbial metabolites on the generation of anti-inflammatory T-reg cells. We found that in mice a short-chain fatty acid (SCFA), butyrate, produced by commensal microorganisms during starch fermentation, facilitated extrathymic generation of T-reg cells. A boost in T-reg-cell numbers after provision of butyrate was due to potentiation of extrathymic differentiation of T-reg cells, as the observed phenomenon was dependent on intronic enhancer CNS1 (conserved non-coding sequence 1), essential for extrathymic but dispensable for thymic T-reg-cell differentiation(1,7). In addition to butyrate, de novo T-reg-cell generation in the periphery was potentiated by propionate, another SCFA of microbial origin capable of histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibition, but not acetate, which lacks this HDAC-inhibitory activity. Our results suggest that bacterial metabolites mediate communication between the commensal microbiota and the immune system, affecting the balance between pro- and anti-inflammatory mechanisms.","[Arpaia, Nicholas; Campbell, Clarissa; Fan, Xiying; Dikiy, Stanislav; van der Veeken, Joris; deRoos, Paul; Coffer, Paul J.; Rudensky, Alexander Y.] Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Howard Hughes Med Inst, New York, NY 10065 USA; [Arpaia, Nicholas; Campbell, Clarissa; Fan, Xiying; Dikiy, Stanislav; van der Veeken, Joris; deRoos, Paul; Coffer, Paul J.; Rudensky, Alexander Y.] Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Ludwig Ctr, New York, NY 10065 USA; [Arpaia, Nicholas; Campbell, Clarissa; Fan, Xiying; Dikiy, Stanislav; van der Veeken, Joris; deRoos, Paul; Coffer, Paul J.; Rudensky, Alexander Y.] Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Program Immunol, New York, NY 10065 USA; [Liu, Hui; Cross, Justin R.] Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Donald B & Catherine C Marron Canc Metab Ctr, New York, NY 10065 USA; [Pfeffer, Klaus] Univ Dusseldorf, Inst Med Microbiol & Hosp Hyg, D-40225 Dusseldorf, Germany; [Coffer, Paul J.] Univ Med Ctr Utrecht, Dept Cell Biol, NL-3584 CX Utrecht, Netherlands","Rudensky, AY (reprint author), Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Howard Hughes Med Inst, New York, NY 10065 USA.",rudenska@mskcc.org,,"Pfeffer, Klaus/0000-0002-5652-6330; Dikiy, Stanislav/0000-0002-8287-6561; Arpaia, Nicholas/0000-0002-0657-0528; Fan, Xiying/0000-0003-3090-381X; Cross, Justin/0000-0002-6356-057X","Damon Runyon Cancer Research Foundation [DRG-2143-13]; Ludwig Center at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center; US National Institutes of Health (NIH) [T32 A1007621, R37 AI034206]","This work was supported by the Robert Black Fellowship of the Damon Runyon Cancer Research Foundation DRG-2143-13 (N.A.), Ludwig Center at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center and the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) grant T32 A1007621(N.A.) and R37 AI034206 (A.Y.R.).

The aetiology and mechanisms underlying most cases of human heterotaxy are poorly understood. In vertebrates, laterality is initiated at the embryonic left-right organizer, where motile cilia generate leftward flow that is detected by immotile sensory cilia, which transduce flow into downstream asymmetric signals(2-6). The mechanism that specifies these two cilia types remains unknown. Here we show that the N-acetylgalactosamine-type O-glycosylation enzyme GALNT11 is crucial to such determination. We previously identified GALNT11 as a candidate disease gene in a patient with heterotaxy(7), and now demonstrate, in Xenopus tropicalis, that galnt11 activates Notch signalling. GALNT11 O-glycosylates human NOTCH1 peptides in vitro, thereby supporting a mechanism of Notch activation either by increasing ADAM17-mediated ectodomain shedding of the Notch receptor or by modification of specific EGF repeats. We further developed a quantitative live imaging technique for Xenopus left-right organizer cilia and show that Galnt11-mediated Notch1 signalling modulates the spatial distribution and ratio of motile and immotile cilia at the left-right organizer. galnt11 or notch1 depletion increases the ratio of motile cilia at the expense of immotile cilia and produces a laterality defect reminiscent of loss of the ciliary sensor Pkd2. By contrast, Notch overexpression decreases this ratio, mimicking the ciliopathy primary ciliary dyskinesia. Together our data demonstrate that Galnt11 modifies Notch, establishing an essential balance between motile and immotile cilia at the left-right organizer to determine laterality, and reveal a novel mechanism for human heterotaxy.","[Boskovski, Marko T.; Yuan, Shiaulou; Makova, Svetlana; Brueckner, Martina; Khokha, Mustafa K.] Yale Univ, Sch Med, Dept Pediat & Genet, Program Vertebrate Dev Biol, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Pedersen, Nis Borbye; Goth, Christoffer Knak; Clausen, Henrik] Univ Copenhagen, Fac Hlth Sci, Dept Cellular & Mol Med, Copenhagen Ctr Glyc, DK-2200 Copenhagen N, Denmark","Khokha, MK (reprint author), Yale Univ, Sch Med, Dept Pediat & Genet, Program Vertebrate Dev Biol, 333 Cedar St, New Haven, CT 06520 USA.",mustafa.khokha@yale.edu,,"Pedersen, Nis Borbye/0000-0003-3725-4533","National Center for Research Resources/National Institutes of Health (NIH) [TL 1 RR024137]; NIH Roadmap for Medical Research; NIH [5T32HD00709436, R01HL093280, DE018825, DE018824]; Danish National Research Foundation [DNRF107]","We thank the patients and their families, who are the inspiration for this study.

The molecular basis of genomic imprinting is allele-specific DNA methylation(1,2). Although it is well known that the de novo DNA methyltransferases Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b are responsible for the establishment of genomic imprinting(3), how the methylation mark is erased during primordial germ cell (PGC) reprogramming remains unclear. Tet1 is one of the ten-eleven translocation family proteins, which have the capacity to oxidize 5-methylcytosine (5mC)(4-6), specifically expressed in reprogramming PGCs(7). Here we report that Tet1 has a critical role in the erasure of genomic imprinting. We show that despite their identical genotype, progenies derived from mating between Tet1 knockout males and wild-type females exhibit a number of variable phenotypes including placental, fetal and postnatal growth defects, and early embryonic lethality. These defects are, at least in part, caused by the dysregulation of imprinted genes, such as Peg10 and Peg3, which exhibit aberrant hypermethylation in the paternal allele of differential methylated regions (DMRs). RNA-seq reveals extensive dysregulation of imprinted genes in the next generation due to paternal loss of Tet1 function. Genome-wide DNA methylation analysis of embryonic day 13.5 PGCs and sperm of Tet1 knockout mice revealed hypermethylation of DMRs of imprinted genes in sperm, which can be traced back to PGCs. Analysis of the DNA methylation dynamics in reprogramming PGCs indicates that Tet1 functions to wipe out remaining methylation, including imprinted genes, at the late reprogramming stage. Furthermore, we provide evidence supporting the role of Tet1 in the erasure of paternal imprints in the female germ line. Thus, our study establishes a critical function of Tet1 in the erasure of genomic imprinting.","[Yamaguchi, Shinpei; Shen, Li; Liu, Yuting; Sendler, Damian; Zhang, Yi] Boston Childrens Hosp, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Yamaguchi, Shinpei; Liu, Yuting; Zhang, Yi] Boston Childrens Hosp, Program Cellular & Mol Med, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Yamaguchi, Shinpei; Liu, Yuting; Zhang, Yi] Boston Childrens Hosp, Dept Pediat, Div Hematol Oncol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Zhang, Yi] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Genet, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Zhang, Yi] Harvard Stem Cell Inst, Boston, MA 02115 USA","Zhang, Y (reprint author), Boston Childrens Hosp, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Boston, MA 02115 USA.",yzhang@genetics.med.harvard.edu,,"Yamaguchi, Shinpei/0000-0002-9377-4835",NIH [U01DK089565]; Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS),"We thank W.

During XCI, Xist coats the future inactiveXchromosome(Xi)(4) and recruitsPolycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) to the X-inactivation centre (Xic)(5). How Xist spreads silencing on a 150-megabases scale is unclear. Here we generate high-resolution maps of Xist binding on the X chromosome across a developmental time course using CHART-seq. In female cells undergoing XCI de novo, Xist follows a two-step mechanism, initially targeting gene-rich islands before spreading to intervening gene-poor domains. Xist is depleted from genes that escape XCI but may concentrate near escapee boundaries. Xist binding is linearly proportional to PRC2 density and H3 lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3), indicating co-migration of Xist and PRC2. Interestingly, when Xist is acutely stripped off from the Xi in post-XCI cells, Xist recovers quickly within both gene-rich and gene-poor domains on a timescale of hours instead of days, indicating a previously primed Xi chromatin state. We conclude that Xist spreading takes distinct stage-specific forms. During initial establishment, Xist follows a two-step mechanism, but during maintenance, Xist spreads rapidly to both gene-rich and gene-poor regions.","[Simon, Matthew D.; Pinter, Stefan F.; Sarma, Kavitha; Bowman, Sarah K.; Kesner, Barry A.; Maier, Verena K.; Kingston, Robert E.; Lee, Jeannie T.] Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Dept Mol Biol, Boston, MA 02114 USA; [Simon, Matthew D.; Pinter, Stefan F.; Sarma, Kavitha; Bowman, Sarah K.; Kesner, Barry A.; Maier, Verena K.; Kingston, Robert E.; Lee, Jeannie T.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Genet, Boston, MA 02114 USA; [Simon, Matthew D.; Fang, Rui; Rutenberg-Schoenberg, Michael] Yale Univ, Dept Mol Biophys & Biochem, West Haven, CT 06516 USA; [Simon, Matthew D.; Fang, Rui; Rutenberg-Schoenberg, Michael] Yale Univ, Inst Chem Biol, West Haven, CT 06516 USA; [Pinter, Stefan F.; Sarma, Kavitha; Kesner, Barry A.; Maier, Verena K.; Lee, Jeannie T.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Boston, MA 02114 USA","Simon, MD (reprint author), Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Dept Mol Biol, Boston, MA 02114 USA.",matthew.simon@yale.edu; kingston@molbio.mgh.harvard.edu; lee@molbio.mgh.harvard.edu,,"Pinter, Stefan/0000-0003-4750-1403","Yale University; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft; MGH Fund for Medical Discovery; National Institutes of Health [F32-GM090765, RO1-GM043901, RO1-GM090278]","We thank J.

The experimental realization of these predicted phases has hitherto proved elusive, with such systems showing enhanced paramagnetism but no spontaneous magnetization in the absence of an external magnetic field. Here we show that nanometre-sized ferromagnetic platelets suspended in a nematic liquid crystal can order ferromagnetically on quenching from the isotropic phase. Cooling in the absence of a magnetic field produces a polydomain sample exhibiting the two opposing states of magnetization, oriented parallel to the direction of nematic ordering. Cooling in the presence of a magnetic field yields a monodomain sample; magnetization can be switched by domain wall movement on reversal of the applied magnetic field. The ferromagnetic properties of this dipolar fluid are due to the interplay of the nematic elastic interaction (which depends critically on the shape of the particles) and the magnetic dipolar interaction. This ferromagnetic phase responds to very small magnetic fields and may find use in magneto-optic devices.","[Mertelj, Alenka; Lisjak, Darja; Drofenik, Miha; Copic, Martin] J Stefan Inst, SI-1000 Ljubljana, Slovenia; [Drofenik, Miha] Univ Maribor, Fac Chem & Chem Engn, SI-2000 Maribor, Slovenia; [Copic, Martin] Univ Ljubljana, Fac Math & Phys, SI-1000 Ljubljana, Slovenia","Mertelj, A (reprint author), J Stefan Inst, SI-1000 Ljubljana, Slovenia.",alenka.mertelj@ijs.si,"Mertelj, Alenka/C-6209-2011; Lisjak, Darja/Q-7474-2016","Mertelj, Alenka/0000-0002-2766-9121; Lisjak, Darja/0000-0003-4154-4592","Slovenian Research Agency [P1-0192, P2-0089-4]","This work was supported by the Slovenian Research Agency (A.

Synaptic vesicles are thought to be regenerated approximately 20 s after fusion by the assembly of clathrin scaffolds or in approximately 1 s by the reversal of fusion pores via 'kiss-and-run' endocytosis. Here we use optogenetics to stimulate cultured hippocampal neurons with a single stimulus, rapidly freeze them after fixed intervals and examine the ultrastructure using electron microscopy-'flash-and-freeze' electron microscopy. Docked vesicles fuse and collapse into the membrane within 30 ms of the stimulus. Compensatory endocytosis occurs within 50 to 100 ms at sites flanking the active zone. Invagination is blocked by inhibition of actin polymerization, and scission is blocked by inhibiting dynamin. Because intact synaptic vesicles are not recovered, this form of recycling is not compatible with kiss-and-run endocytosis; moreover, it is 200-fold faster than clathrin-mediated endocytosis.

Imidazopyrazines demonstrate potent preventive, therapeutic, and transmission-blocking activity in rodent malaria models, are active against blood-stage field isolates of the major human pathogens P. falciparum and P. vivax, and inhibit liver-stage hypnozoites in the simian parasite P. cynomolgi. We show that imidazopyrazines exert their effect through inhibitory interaction with the ATP-binding pocket of PI(4)K, altering the intracellular distribution of phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate.

Here we present the crystal structures of a heterodimeric complex between the extracellular domains of GBR1 and GBR2 in the apo, agonist-bound and antagonist-bound forms. The apo and antagonist-bound structures represent the resting state of the receptor; the agonist-bound complex corresponds to the active state. Both subunits adopt an open conformation at rest, and only GBR1 closes on agonist-induced receptor activation. The agonists and antagonists are anchored in the interdomain crevice of GBR1 by an overlapping set of residues. An antagonist confines GBR1 to the open conformation of the inactive state, whereas an agonist induces its domain closure for activation. Our data reveal a unique activation mechanism for GABA(B) receptor that involves the formation of a novel heterodimer interface between subunits.","[Geng, Yong; Bush, Martin; Mosyak, Lidia; Wang, Feng; Fan, Qing R.] Columbia Univ, Dept Pharmacol, New York, NY 10032 USA; [Fan, Qing R.] Columbia Univ, Dept Pathol & Cell Biol, New York, NY 10032 USA","Fan, QR (reprint author), Columbia Univ, Dept Pharmacol, New York, NY 10032 USA.",qf13@columbia.edu,,,American Heart Association [SDG0835183N]; National Institute of Health [R01GM088454],"We thank W.

The power carried away by the jets, and, hence, the feedback they provide to their surroundings, depends strongly on their composition. Jets containing a baryonic component should carry significantly more energy than electron-positron jets. Energetic considerations(1,2) and circular-polarization measurements(3) have provided conflicting circumstantial evidence for the presence or absence of baryons in jets, and the only system in which they have been unequivocally detected is the peculiar X-ray binary SS 433 (refs 4, 5). Here we report the detection of Doppler-shifted X-ray emission lines from a more typical black-hole candidate X-ray binary, 4U 1630-47, coincident with the reappearance of radio emission from the jets of the source. We argue that these lines arise from baryonic matter in a jet travelling at approximately two-thirds the speed of light, thereby establishing the presence of baryons in the jet. Such baryonic jets are more likely to be powered by the accretion disk(6) than by the spin of the black hole(7), and if the baryons can be accelerated to relativistic speeds, the jets should be strong sources of gamma-rays and neutrino emission.","[Trigo, Maria Diaz] European So Observ, D-85748 Garching, Germany; [Miller-Jones, James C.

Accurate models of physical communication devices must include quantum effects, but these typically make the theory intractable(2-5). As a result, communication capacities-the maximum possible rates of data transmission-are not known, even for transmission between two users connected by an electromagnetic waveguide with Gaussian noise(6). Here we present an exactly solvable model of communication with a fully quantum electromagnetic field. This gives explicit expressions for all point-to-point capacities of noisy quantum channels, with implications for quantum key distribution and fibre-optic communications. We also develop a theory of quantum communication networks by solving some rudimentary models including broadcast and multiple-access channels. We compare the predictions of our model with the orthodox Gaussian model and in all cases find agreement to within a few bits. At high signal-to-noise ratios, our simple model captures the relevant physics while remaining amenable to exact solution.","[Smith, Graeme; Smolin, John A.] IBM TJ Watson Res Ctr, Yorktown Hts, NY 10598 USA","Smith, G (reprint author), IBM TJ Watson Res Ctr, Yorktown Hts, NY 10598 USA.",gsbsmith@gmail.com,,,DARPA QUEST programme [HR0011-09-C-0047],This work was supported by the DARPA QUEST programme under contract no.

Above a certain critical insolation, this destabilizing greenhouse feedback can 'run away' until the oceans have completely evaporated(1-4). Through increases in stratospheric humidity, warming may also cause evaporative loss of the oceans to space before the runaway greenhouse state occurs(5,6). The critical insolation thresholds for these processes, however, remain uncertain because they have so far been evaluated using one-dimensional models that cannot account for the dynamical and cloud feedback effects that are key stabilizing features of the Earth's climate. Here we use a three-dimensional global climate model to show that the insolation threshold for the runaway greenhouse state to occur is about 375 W m(-2), which is significantly higher than previously thought(6,7). Our model is specifically developed to quantify the climate response of Earth-like planets to increased insolation in hot and extremely moist atmospheres. In contrast with previous studies, we find that clouds have a destabilizing feedback effect on the long-term warming. However, subsident, unsaturated regions created by the Hadley circulation have a stabilizing effect that is strong enough to shift the runaway greenhouse limit to higher values of insolation than are inferred from one-dimensional models. Furthermore, because of wavelength-dependent radiative effects, the stratosphere remains sufficiently cold and dry to hamper the escape of atmospheric water, even at large fluxes. This has strong implications for the possibility of liquid water existing on Venus early in its history, and extends the size of the habitable zone around other stars.","[Leconte, Jeremy; Forget, Francois; Charnay, Benjamin; Pottier, Alizee] Inst Pierre Simon Laplace, Meteorol Dynam Lab, F-75252 Paris, France; [Wordsworth, Robin] Univ Chicago, Dept Geol Sci, Chicago, IL 60637 USA","Leconte, J (reprint author), Inst Pierre Simon Laplace, Meteorol Dynam Lab, 4 Pl Jussieu,BP 99, F-75252 Paris, France.",jeremy.leconte@lmd.jussieu.fr,,,Region Ile-de-France,"We thank our referees, J.

Enhanced plasticity during critical periods of early life is linked to differentiating parvalbumin (PV)-interneuron networks(1-7), suggesting that recent experience may modulate learning by targeting the differentiation state of PV neurons(8-11) in the adult. Here we show that environmental enrichment and Pavlovian contextual fear conditioning induce opposite, sustained and reversible hippocampal PV-network configurations in adult mice. Specifically, enrichment promotes the emergence of large fractions of low-differentiation (low PV and GAD67 expression) basket cells with low excitatory-to-inhibitory synaptic-density ratios, whereas fear conditioning leads to large fractions of high-differentiation (high PV and GAD67 expression) basket cells with high excitatory-to-inhibitory synaptic-density ratios. Pharmacogenetic inhibition or activation of PV neurons was sufficient to induce such opposite low-PV-network or high-PV-network configurations, respectively. The low-PV-network configuration enhanced structural synaptic plasticity(12,13), and memory consolidation and retrieval, whereas these were reduced by the high-PV-network configuration. We then show that maze navigation learning(14) induces a hippocampal low-PV-network configuration paralleled by enhanced memory and structural synaptic plasticity throughout training, followed by a shift to a high-PV-network configuration after learning completion. The shift to a low-PV-network configuration specifically involved increased vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP)-positive GABAergic boutons and synaptic transmission onto PV neurons(15,16). Closely comparable low-and high-PV-network configurations involving VIP boutons were specifically induced in primary motor cortex upon rotarod motor learning(17,18). These results uncover a network plasticity mechanism induced after learning through VIP-PV microcircuit modulation(19), and involving large, sustained and reversible shifts in the configuration of PV basket-cell networks in the adult. This novel form of experience-related plasticity in the adult modulates memory consolidation, retrieval and learning, and might be harnessed for therapeutic strategies to promote cognitive enhancement and neuroprotection.","[Donato, Flavio; Rompani, Santiago Belluco; Caroni, Pico] Friedrich Miescher Inst, CH-4058 Basel, Switzerland","Caroni, P (reprint author), Friedrich Miescher Inst, Maulbeerstr 66, CH-4058 Basel, Switzerland.",caroni@fmi.ch,,,Novartis Research Foundation; NCCR Synapsy,"We thank S.

Even within a single tissue, fibroblasts exhibit considerable functional diversity, but it is not known whether this reflects the existence of a differentiation hierarchy or is a response to different environmental factors. Here we show, using transplantation assays and lineage tracing in mice, that the fibroblasts of skin connective tissue arise from two distinct lineages. One forms the upper dermis, including the dermal papilla that regulates hair growth and the arrector pili muscle, which controls piloerection. The other forms the lower dermis, including the reticular fibroblasts that synthesize the bulk of the fibrillar ECM, and the preadipocytes and adipocytes of the hypodermis. The upper lineage is required for hair follicle formation. In wounded adult skin, the initial wave of dermal repair is mediated by the lower lineage and upper dermal fibroblasts are recruited only during re-epithelialization.

Hallmarks of naive pluripotency include driving Oct4 (also known as Pou5f1) transcription by its distal enhancer, retaining a pre-inactivation Xchromosome state, and global reduction in DNA methylation and in H3K27me3 repressive chromatin mark deposition on developmental regulatory gene promoters(3). Upon withdrawal of 2i/LIF, naive mouse ES cells can drift towards a primed pluripotent state resembling that of the post-implantation epiblast(4). Although human ES cells share several molecular features with naive mouse ES cells(5), they also share a variety of epigenetic properties with primed murine epiblast stemcells (EpiSCs)(6,7). These include predominant use of the proximal enhancer element to maintain OCT4 expression, pronounced tendency for X chromosome inactivation in most female human ES cells, increase in DNA methylation and prominent deposition of H3K27me3 and bivalent domain acquisition on lineage regulatory genes(7). The feasibility of establishing human ground state naive pluripotency in vitro with equivalent molecular and functional features to those characterized in mouse ES cells remains to be defined(1). Here we establish defined conditions that facilitate the derivation of genetically unmodified human naive pluripotent stem cells from already established primed human ES cells, from somatic cells through induced pluripotent stem(iPS) cell reprogramming or directly from blastocysts. The novel naive pluripotent cells validated herein retain molecular characteristics and functional properties that are highly similar to mouse naive ES cells, and distinct from conventional primed human pluripotent cells. This includes competence in the generation of cross-species chimaeric mouse embryos that underwent organogenesis following microinjection of human naive iPS cells into mouse morulas. Collectively, our findings establish new avenues for regenerative medicine, patient-specific iPS cell disease modelling and the study of early human development in vitro and in vivo.","[Gafni, Ohad; Weinberger, Leehee; Mansour, Abed AlFatah; Manor, Yair S.; Chomsky, Elad; Viukov, Sergey; Maza, Itay; Zviran, Asaf; Rais, Yoach; Krupalnik, Vladislav; Zerbib, Mirie; Geula, Shay; Caspi, Inbal; Schneir, Dan; Massarwa, Rada; Novershtern, Noa; Hanna, Jacob H.] Weizmann Inst Sci, Dept Mol Genet, IL-76100 Rehovot, Israel; [Chomsky, Elad; Shipony, Zohar; Mukamel, Zohar; Tanay, Amos] Weizmann Inst Sci, Dept Regulat Biol, IL-76100 Rehovot, Israel; [Chomsky, Elad; Shipony, Zohar; Mukamel, Zohar; Tanay, Amos] Weizmann Inst Sci, Dept Comp Sci & Appl Math, IL-76100 Rehovot, Israel; [Ben-Yosef, Dalit; Kalma, Yael; Shwartz, Tamar] Tel Aviv Univ, Tel Aviv Sourasky Med Ctr, Lis Matern Hosp, Wolfe PGD Stem Cell Lab,Racine IVF Unit, IL-69978 Tel Aviv, Israel; [Ben-Yosef, Dalit] Tel Aviv Univ, Sackler Sch Med, Dept Cell & Dev Biol, IL-69978 Tel Aviv, Israel; [Gilad, Shlomit; Amann-Zalcenstein, Daniela; Benjamin, Sima] Weizmann Inst Sci, INCPM, IL-76100 Rehovot, Israel; [Amit, Ido] Weizmann Inst Sci, Dept Immunol, IL-76100 Rehovot, Israel","Hanna, JH (reprint author), Weizmann Inst Sci, Dept Mol Genet, IL-76100 Rehovot, Israel.",rada.massarwa@weizmann.ac.il; noa.novershtern@weizmann.ac.il; jacob.hanna@weizmann.ac.il,"HANNA, JACOB/K-1339-2012","HANNA, JACOB/0000-0003-2042-9974; Novershtern, Noa/0000-0002-2244-6877; Geula, Shay/0000-0001-8111-4410; Mansour, Abed AlFatah/0000-0001-9025-6998","Ilana and Pascal Mantoux; European Research Council [StG-2011-281906]; Leona M. and Harry B.

These are assembled from thousands of protein subunits translocated across the cell membrane by an export machinery at the base of each flagellum. Unfolded subunits(1-3) then transit through a narrow channel at the core of the growing flagellum to the tip, where they crystallize into the nascent structure. As the flagellum lengthens outside the cell, the rate of flagellum growth does not change(4). The mystery is how subunit transit is maintained at a constant rate without a discernible energy source in the channel of the external flagellum(5). We present evidence for a simple physical mechanism for flagellum growth that harnesses the entropic force of the unfolded subunits themselves. We show that a subunit docked at the export machinery can be captured by a free subunit through head-to-tail linkage of juxtaposed amino (N)- and carboxy (C)-terminal helices. We propose that sequential rounds of linkage would generate a multisubunit chain that pulls successive subunits into and through the channel to the flagellum tip, and by isolating filaments growing on bacterial cells we reveal the predicted chain of head-to-tail linked subunits in the transit channel of flagella. Thermodynamic analysis confirms that links in the subunit chain can withstand the pulling force generated by rounds of subunit crystallization at the flagellum tip, and polymer theory predicts that as the N terminus of each unfolded subunit crystallizes, the entropic force at the subunit C terminus would increase, rapidly overcoming the threshold required to pull the next subunit from the export machinery. This pulling force would adjust automatically over the increasing length of the growing flagellum, maintaining a constant rate of subunit delivery to the tip.","[Evans, Lewis D.

Recent studies of the Parkinson's disease associated genes PINK1 (ref. 2) and parkin (PARK2, ref. 3) indicate that they may act in a quality control pathway preventing the accumulation of dysfunctional mitochondria(4-8). Here we elucidate regulators that have an impact on parkin translocation to damaged mitochondria with genome-wide small interfering RNA (siRNA) screens coupled to high-content microscopy. Screening yielded gene candidates involved in diverse cellular processes that were subsequently validated in low-throughput assays. This led to characterization of TOMM7 as essential for stabilizing PINK1 on the outer mitochondrial membrane following mitochondrial damage. We also discovered that HSPA1L (HSP70 family member) and BAG4 have mutually opposing roles in the regulation of parkin translocation. The screens revealed that SIAH3, found to localize to mitochondria, inhibits PINK1 accumulation after mitochondrial insult, reducing parkin translocation. Overall, our screens provide a rich resource to understand mitochondrial quality control.","[Hasson, Samuel A.; Kane, Lesley A.; Yamano, Koji; Huang, Chiu-Hui; Sliter, Danielle A.; Wang, Chunxin; Hessa, Tara; Youle, Richard J.] NINDS, Surg Neurol Branch, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Hasson, Samuel A.; Buehler, Eugen; Guha, Rajarshi; Martin, Scott E.] NIH, Div Preclin Innovat, Natl Ctr Adv Translat Sci, Rockville, MD 20850 USA; [Heman-Ackah, Sabrina M.] NIH, Ctr Regenerat Med, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA","Youle, RJ (reprint author), NINDS, Surg Neurol Branch, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA.",youler@ninds.nih.gov,"Wang, Chunxin/B-9312-2016","Wang, Chunxin/0000-0001-6015-6806","Japan Society for Promotion of Science; NIGMS Research Associate Program; NIH, NINDS; Trans-NIH RNAi initiative","We thank P.

Autophagy has a major role in cellular homeostasis and has been implicated in various forms of human disease(2-4). The role of autophagy in cancer seems to be complex, with reports indicating both pro-tumorigenic and tumour-suppressive roles(3,5-12). Here we show, in a humanized genetically-modified mouse model of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma(PDAC), that autophagy's role in tumour development is intrinsically connected to the status of the tumour suppressor p53. Mice with pancreases containing an activated oncogenic allele of Kras (also called Ki-Ras)-the most common mutational event in PDAC(13)-develop a small number of pre-cancerous lesions that stochastically develop into PDAC over time. However, mice also lacking the essential autophagy genes Atg5 or Atg7 accumulate low-grade, pre-malignant pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia lesions, but progression to high-grade pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasias and PDAC is blocked. In marked contrast, in mice containing oncogenic Kras and lacking p53, loss of autophagy no longer blocks tumour progression, but actually accelerates tumour onset, with metabolic analysis revealing enhanced glucose uptake and enrichment of anabolic pathways, which can fuel tumour growth. These findings provide considerable insight into the role of autophagy in cancer and have important implications for autophagy inhibition in cancer therapy. In this regard, we also show that treatment of mice with the autophagy inhibitor hydroxychloroquine, which is currently being used in several clinical trials(14), significantly accelerates tumour formation in mice containing oncogenic Kras but lacking p53.","[Rosenfeldt, Mathias T.; O'Prey, Jim; Morton, Jennifer P.; Nixon, Colin; MacKay, Gillian; Mrowinska, Agata; Au, Amy; Zheng, Liang; Ridgway, Rachel; Anderson, Kurt I.; Gottlieb, Eyal; Sansom, Owen J.; Ryan, Kevin M.] Canc Res UK Beatson Inst, Glasgow G61 1BD, Lanark, Scotland; [Rai, Taranjit Singh; Adams, Peter D.] Univ Glasgow, Inst Canc Studies, Glasgow G61 1BD, Lanark, Scotland","Ryan, KM (reprint author), Canc Res UK Beatson Inst, Garscube Estate,Switchback Rd, Glasgow G61 1BD, Lanark, Scotland.",k.ryan@beatson.gla.ac.uk,"Gottlieb, Eyal/G-6450-2010; Rai, Taranjit Singh/A-3659-2012","Gottlieb, Eyal/0000-0002-9770-0956; Rai, Taranjit Singh/0000-0002-7276-7492; Ryan, Kevin M./0000-0002-1059-9681; Anderson, Kurt/0000-0002-9324-9598; Sansom, Owen J./0000-0001-9540-3010; Morton, Jennifer/0000-0001-5766-9141",Cancer Research UK; Pancreatic Cancer Research Fund,"We are grateful to M.

The similar to 120 mammalian CAAX proteins function at cellular membranes and include the Ras superfamily of small GTPases, nuclear lamins, the gamma-subunit of heterotrimeric GTPases, and several protein kinases and phosphatases(2). The proper localization of CAAX proteins to cell membranes is orchestrated by a series of post-translational modifications of the carboxy-terminal CAAX motifs(3) (where C is cysteine, A is an aliphatic amino acid and X is any amino acid). These reactions involve prenylation of the cysteine residue, cleavage at the AAX tripeptide and methylation of the carboxyl-prenylated cysteine residue. The major CAAX protease activity is mediated by Rce1 (Ras and a-factor converting enzyme 1), an intramembrane protease (IMP) of the endoplasmic reticulum(4,5). Information on the architecture and proteolytic mechanism of Rce1 has been lacking. Here we report the crystal structure of a Methano-coccus maripaludis homologue of Rce1, whose endopeptidase specificity for farnesylated peptides mimics that of eukaryotic Rce1. Its structure, comprising eight transmembrane alpha-helices, and catalytic site are distinct from those of other IMPs. The catalytic residues are located similar to 10 angstrom into the membrane and are exposed to the cytoplasm and membrane through a conical cavity that accommodates the prenylated CAAX substrate. We propose that the farnesyl lipid binds to a site at the opening of two transmembrane alpha-helices, which results in the scissile bond being positioned adjacent to a glutamate-activated nucleophilic water molecule. This study suggests that Rce1 is the founding member of a novel IMP family, the glutamate IMPs.","[Manolaridis, Ioannis; Kulkarni, Kiran; Dodd, Roger B.; Zhang, Ziguo; Hanrahan, Sarah J.; Thompson, Andrew J.; Cronin, Nora; Barford, David] Inst Canc Res, London SW3 6JB, England; [Ogasawara, Satoshi; Iwata, So] Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Med, Dept Cell Biol, Sakyo Ku, Kyoto 6068501, Japan; [Ogasawara, Satoshi; Iwata, So] JST, Res Accelerat Program, Membrane Prot Crystallog Project, Sakyo Ku, Kyoto 6068501, Japan; [Bineva, Ganka; O'Reilly, Nicola] Canc Res UK London Res Inst, London WC2A 3LY, England; [Iwata, So] Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Dept Life Sci, London SW7 2AZ, England","Barford, D (reprint author), Inst Canc Res, 237 Fulham Rd, London SW3 6JB, England.",dbarford@mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk,"Thompson, Andrew/B-1463-2014","Thompson, Andrew/0000-0003-2413-3281",Cancer Research UK; Japan Science and Technology agency; BBSRC [BB/G023425/1],"This work was funded by a Cancer Research UK grant to D.

Transcription requires dynamic chromatin configurations between promoters and their corresponding distal regulatory elements(2). It is believed that their communication occurs within large discrete foci of aggregated RNA polymerases termed transcription factories in three-dimensional nuclear space(3). However, the dynamic nature of chromatin connectivity has not been characterized at the genome-wide level. Here, through a chromatin interaction analysis with paired-end tagging approach(3-5) using an antibody that primarily recognizes the pre-initiation complexes of RNA polymerase II6, we explore the transcriptional interactomes of three mouse cells of progressive lineage commitment, including pluripotent embryonic stem cells(7), neural stem cells(8) and neurosphere stem/progenitor cells(9). Our global chromatin connectivity maps reveal approximately 40,000 long-range interactions, suggest precise enhancer-promoter associations and delineate cell-type-specific chromatin structures. Analysis of the complex regulatory repertoire shows that there are extensive colocalizations among promoters and distal-acting enhancers. Most of the enhancers associate with promoters located beyond their nearest active genes, indicating that the linear juxtaposition is not the only guiding principle driving enhancer target selection. Although promoter-enhancer interactions exhibit high cell-type specificity, promoters involved in interactions are found to be generally common and mostly active among different cells. Chromatin connectivity networks reveal that the pivotal genes of reprogramming functions are transcribed within physical proximity to each other in embryonic stem cells, linking chromatin architecture to coordinated gene expression. Our study sets the stage for the full-scale dissection of spatial and temporal genome structures and their roles in orchestrating development.","[Zhang, Yubo; Wong, Chee-Hong; Ngan, Chew Yee; Wei, Chia-Lin] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Joint Genome Inst, Sequencing Technol Grp, Walnut Creek, CA 94598 USA; [Birnbaum, Ramon Y.; Ahituv, Nadav] UCSF, Inst Human Genet, Dept Bioengn & Therapeut Sci, San Francisco, CA 94158 USA; [Li, Guoliang; Ruan, Yijun] Univ Connecticut, Jackson Lab Genom Med, Farmington, CT 06030 USA; [Li, Guoliang; Ruan, Yijun] Univ Connecticut, Dept Genet & Dev Biol, Farmington, CT 06030 USA; [Li, Guoliang; Lim, Joanne; Tai, Eunice; Poh, Huay Mei; Wong, Eleanor; Mulawadi, Fabianus Hendriyan; Sung, Wing-Kin; Wei, Chia-Lin] Genome Inst Singapore, Singapore 138672, Singapore; [Favaro, Rebecca; Nicolis, Silvia] Univ Milano Bicocca, Dept Biol Sci & Biotechnol, I-20126 Milan, Italy","Wei, CL (reprint author), Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Joint Genome Inst, Sequencing Technol Grp, Walnut Creek, CA 94598 USA.",cwei@lbl.gov,,"Favaro, Rebecca/0000-0002-6195-5711; Ahituv, Nadav/0000-0002-7434-8144; Li, Guoliang/0000-0003-1601-6640","ASTIL Regione Lombardia (SAL-19) [16874]; Telethon [GGP12152]; Cariplo [2010-0673]; AIRC [IG-5801]; NINDS [R01NS079231]; NICHD [R01HD059862]; NHGRI [R01HG005058, R01HG006768]; NIDDK [R01DK090382]; NIGMS [GM61390]; Simons Foundation SFARI [256769]; UCSF Program for Biomedical Breakthrough Research (PBBR); Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*STAR), Singapore; Office of Science of the U.S. Department of Energy [DE-AC02-05CH11231]; National Institutes of Health ENCODE [R01 HG004456-01, R01HG003521-01, 1U54HG004557-01]","The authors thank J.

Only similar to 200-300 nm in diameter and a few micrometres long, they are separated from the cytoplasm by the ciliary neck and basal body. Often called sensory cilia, they are thought to receive chemical and mechanical stimuli and initiate specific cellular signal transduction pathways. When activated by a ligand, hedgehog pathway proteins, such as GLI2 and smoothened (SMO), translocate from the cell into the cilium(1,2). Mutations in primary ciliary proteins are associated with severe developmental defects(3). The ionic conditions, permeability of the primary cilia membrane, and effectiveness of the diffusion barriers between the cilia and cell body are unknown. Here we show that cilia are a unique calcium compartment regulated by a heteromeric TRP channel, PKD1L1-PKD2L1, in mice and humans. In contrast to the hypothesis that polycystin (PKD) channels initiate changes in ciliary calcium that are conducted into the cytoplasm(4), we show that changes in ciliary calcium concentration occur without substantially altering global cytoplasmic calcium. PKD1L1-PKD2L1 acts as a ciliary calcium channel controlling ciliary calcium concentration and thereby modifying SMO-activated GLI2 translocation and GLI1 expression.","[Delling, Markus; DeCaen, Paul G.; Doerner, Julia F.; Febvay, Sebastien; Clapham, David E.] Boston Childrens Hosp, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Dept Cardiol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Clapham, David E.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Neurobiol, Boston, MA 02115 USA","Clapham, DE (reprint author), Boston Childrens Hosp, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Dept Cardiol, 320 Longwood Ave, Boston, MA 02115 USA.",dclapham@enders.tch.harvard.edu,,,NIH [T32-HL007572],We thank the Mouse Gene Manipulation Facility of the Boston Children's Hospital Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities Research Center (IDDRC; NIHP30-HD 18655).

Housing components of the cell division apparatus between cell divisions, primary cilia also serve as specialized compartments for calcium signalling(2) and hedgehog signalling pathways(3). Specialized sensory cilia such as retinal photoreceptors and olfactory cilia use diverse ion channels(4-7). An ion current has been measured from primary cilia of kidney cells(8), but the responsible genes have not been identified. The polycystin proteins (PC and PKD), identified in linkage studies of polycystic kidney disease(9), are candidate channels divided into two structural classes: 11-transmembrane proteins (PKD1, PKD1L1 and PKD1L2) remarkable for a large extracellular amino terminus of putative cell adhesion domains and a G-protein-coupled receptor proteolytic site, and the 6-transmembrane channel proteins (PKD2, PKD2L1 and PKD2L2; TRPPs). Evidence indicates that the PKD1 proteins associate with the PKD2 proteins via coiled-coil domains(10-12). Here we use a transgenic mouse in which only cilia express a fluorophore and use it to record directly from primary cilia, and demonstrate that PKD1L1 and PKD2L1 form ion channels at high densities in several cell types. In conjunction with an accompanying manuscript(2), we show that the PKD1L1-PKD2L1 heteromeric channel establishes the cilia as a unique calcium compartment within cells that modulates established hedgehog pathways.","[DeCaen, Paul G.; Delling, Markus; Clapham, David E.] Childrens Hosp Boston, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Dept Cardiol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Vien, Thuy N.] Tufts Univ, Sackler Sch Grad Biomed Sci, Dept Neurosci, Boston, MA 02111 USA; [Clapham, David E.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Neurobiol, Boston, MA 02115 USA","Clapham, DE (reprint author), Childrens Hosp Boston, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Dept Cardiol, 320 Longwood Ave, Boston, MA 02115 USA.",dclapham@enders.tch.harvard.edu,,,"NIH [T32 HL007572, P30 HD18655]","P.G.D. was supported by NIH T32 HL007572.

Here we report the structure of an agonist-bound, active state of the human M2 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor stabilized by a G-protein mimetic camelid antibody fragment isolated by conformational selection using yeast surface display. In addition to the expected changes in the intracellular surface, the structure reveals larger conformational changes in the extracellular region and orthosteric binding site than observed in the active states of the beta(2)AR and rhodopsin. We also report the structure of the M2 receptor simultaneously bound to the orthosteric agonist iperoxo and the positive allosteric modulator LY2119620. This structure reveals that LY2119620 recognizes a largely pre-formed binding site in the extracellular vestibule of the iperoxo-bound receptor, inducing a slight contraction of this outer binding pocket.

Like voltage-gated channels, TRPV1 exhibits four-fold symmetry around a central ion pathway formed by transmembrane segments 5-6 (S5-S6) and the intervening pore loop, which is flanked by S1-S4 voltage-sensor-like domains. TRPV1 has a wide extracellular 'mouth' with a short selectivity filter. The conserved 'TRP domain' interacts with the S4-S5 linker, consistent with its contribution to allosteric modulation. Subunit organization is facilitated by interactions among cytoplasmic domains, including amino-terminal ankyrin repeats.

A domain (consisting of transmembrane segments 1-4) that moves during activation of voltage-gated channels remains stationary in TRPV1, highlighting differences in gating mechanisms for these structurally related channel superfamilies. TRPV1 opening is associated with major structural rearrangements in the outer pore, including the pore helix and selectivity filter, as well as pronounced dilation of a hydrophobic constriction at the lower gate, suggesting a dual gating mechanism.

Light from the reverse shock should be highly polarized if the jet's magnetic field is globally ordered and advected from the central engine(3,4), with a position angle that is predicted to remain stable in magnetized baryonic jet models(5) or vary randomly with time if the field is produced locally by plasma or magnetohydrodynamic instabilities(6,7). Degrees of linear polarization of P approximate to 10 per cent in the optical band have previously been detected in the early afterglow(6,8), but the lack of temporal measurements prevented definitive tests of competing jet models(9-14). Hours to days after the gamma-ray burst, polarization levels are low (P<4 per cent), when emission from the shocked ambient medium dominates(15-17). Here we report the detection of P=28(-4)(+4) per cent in the immediate afterglow of Swift gamma-ray burst GRB 120308A, four minutes after its discovery in the gamma-ray band, decreasing to P = 16(-4)(+5) per cent over the subsequent ten minutes. The polarization position angle remains stable, changing by no more than 15 degrees over this time, with a possible trend suggesting gradual rotation and ruling out plasma or magnetohydrodynamic instabilities. Instead, the polarization properties show that GRBs contain magnetized baryonic jets with large-scale uniform fields that can survive long after the initial explosion.","[Mundell, C. G.; Arnold, D.

Howardite, eucrite and diogenite (HED) meteorites represent regolith, basaltic-crust, lower-crust and possibly ultramafic-mantle samples of asteroid Vesta, which is the lone surviving, large, differentiated, basaltic rocky protoplanet in the Solar System(1). Only a few of these meteorites, the orthopyroxene-rich diogenites, contain olivine, typically with a concentration of less than 25 per cent by volume(2). Olivine was tentatively identified on Vesta(3,4), on the basis of spectral and colour data, but other observations did not confirm its presence(5). Here we report that olivine is indeed present locally on Vesta's surface but that, unexpectedly, it has not been found within the deep, south-pole basins, which are thought to be excavated mantle rocks(6-8). Instead, it occurs as near-surface materials in the northern hemisphere. Unlike the meteorites, the olivine-rich (more than 50 per cent by volume) material is not associated with diogenite but seems to be mixed with howardite, the most common(7,9) surface material. Olivine is exposed in crater walls and in ejecta scattered diffusely over a broad area. The size of the olivine exposures and the absence of associated diogenite favour a mantle source, but the exposures are located far from the deep impact basins. The amount and distribution of observed olivine-rich material suggest a complex evolutionary history for Vesta.","[Ammannito, E.; De Sanctis, M.

Despite decades of research, its behaviour continues to challenge scientists. In the eastern equatorial Pacific Ocean, the anomalously cool sea surface temperatures (SSTs) found during La Nina events and the warm waters of modest El Nino events both propagate westwards, as in the seasonal cycle(7). In contrast, SST anomalies propagate eastwards during extreme El Nino events, prominently in the post-1976 period(7-10), spurring unusual weather events worldwide with costly consequences(3-6,11). The cause of this propagation asymmetry is currently unknown(10). Here we trace the cause of the asymmetry to the variations in upper ocean currents in the equatorial Pacific, whereby the westward-flowing currents are enhanced during La Nina events but reversed during extreme El Nino events. Our results highlight that propagation asymmetry is favoured when the westward mean equatorial currents weaken, as is projected to be the case under global warming(12-14). By analysing past and future climate simulations of an ensemble of models with more realistic propagation, we find a doubling in the occurrences of El Nino events that feature prominent eastward propagation characteristics in a warmer world. Our analysis thus suggests that more frequent emergence of propagation asymmetry will be an indication of the Earth's warming climate.","[Santoso, Agus; McGregor, Shayne; England, Matthew H.] Univ New S Wales, Australian Res Council ARC Ctr Excellence Climate, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia; [Santoso, Agus; McGregor, Shayne; England, Matthew H.] Univ New S Wales, Climate Change Res Ctr, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia; [Jin, Fei-Fei] Univ Hawaii Manoa, SOEST, Dept Meteorol, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; [Cai, Wenju] CSIRO, Marine & Atmospher Res, Aspendale, Vic 3195, Australia; [An, Soon-Il] Yonsei Univ, Dept Atmospher Sci, Seoul 120749, South Korea; [McPhaden, Michael J.] NOAA, Pacific Marine Environm Lab, Seattle, WA 98115 USA; [Guilyardi, Eric] Univ Paris 06, CNRS, IPSL, Lab Oceanog & Climat Experimentat & Approches Num, F-75252 Paris 05, France; [Guilyardi, Eric] Univ Reading, Dept Meteorol, Natl Ctr Atmospher Sci NCAS Climate, Reading RG6 6BB, Berks, England","Santoso, A (reprint author), Univ New S Wales, Australian Res Council ARC Ctr Excellence Climate, Level 4 Mathews Bldg, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia.",a.santoso@unsw.edu.au,"England, Matthew/A-7539-2011; Santoso, Agus/J-7350-2012; Cai, Wenju/C-2864-2012; Guilyardi, Eric/D-4868-2011; McPhaden, Michael/D-9799-2016","England, Matthew/0000-0001-9696-2930; Santoso, Agus/0000-0001-7749-8124; Guilyardi, Eric/0000-0002-2255-8625; ",Australian Research Council; Australian Climate Change Science Programme; National Research Foundation of Korea; Korean government (MEST) [NRF-2009-C1AAA001-2009-0093042]; NOAA,"We acknowledge the World Climate Research Programme's Working Group on Coupled Modelling and all modelling groups for making the CMIP data available.

However, the observed seismic properties of lower crust and upper mantle in oceanic island arcs(2,3) differ significantly from those in the continental crust(4). Accordingly, significant modifications of lower arc crust must occur, if continental crust is indeed formed from island arcs. Here we investigate how the seismic characteristics of arc crust are transformed into those of the continental crust by calculating the density and seismic structure of two exposed sections of island arc (Kohistan and Talkeetna). The Kohistan crustal section is negatively buoyant with respect to the underlying depleted upper mantle at depths exceeding 40 kilometres and is characterized by a steady increase in seismic velocity similar to that observed in active arcs. In contrast, the lower Talkeetna crust is density sorted, preserving only relicts (about ten to a hundred metres thick) of rock with density exceeding that of the underlying mantle. Specifically, the foundering of the lower Talkeetna crust resulted in the replacement of dense mafic and ultramafic cumulates by residual upper mantle, producing a sharp seismic discontinuity at depths of around 38 to 42 kilometres, characteristic of the continental Mohorovicic discontinuity (the Moho). Dynamic calculations indicate that foundering is an episodic process that occurs in most arcs with a periodicity of half a million to five million years. Moreover, because foundering will continue after arc magmatism ceases, this process ultimately results in the formation of the continental Moho.","[Jagoutz, Oliver] MIT, Dept Earth Atmospher & Planetary Sci, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Behn, Mark D.] Woods Hole Oceanog Inst, Dept Geol & Geophys, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA","Jagoutz, O (reprint author), MIT, Dept Earth Atmospher & Planetary Sci, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",jagoutz@mit.edu,"Behn, Mark/F-5813-2012","Behn, Mark/0000-0002-2001-1335","NSF [EAR 0910644, EAR 1316333]","The work was supported by NSF grant numbers EAR 0910644 (to O.J.) and EAR 1316333 (to M.

Traditionally, epistasis is inferred on the basis of non-independence of genotypic values between loci for a given trait. However, epistasis for fitness should also have a genomic footprint(5-7). To capture this signal, we have developed a simple approach that relies on detecting genotype ratio distortion as a sign of epistasis, and we apply this method to a large panel of Drosophila melanogaster recombinant inbred lines(8,9). Here we confirm experimentally that instances of genotype ratio distortion represent loci with epistatic fitness effects; we conservatively estimate that any two haploid genomes in this study are expected to harbour 1.15 pairs of epistatically interacting alleles. This observation has important implications for speciation genetics, as it indicates that the raw material to drive reproductive isolation is segregating contemporaneously within species and does not necessarily require, as proposed by the Dobzhansky-Muller model, the emergence of incompatible mutations independently derived and fixed in allopatry. The relevance of our result extends beyond speciation, as it demonstrates that epistasis is widespread but that it may often go undetected owing to lack of statistical power or lack of genome-wide scope of the experiments.","[Corbett-Detig, Russell B.; Zhou, Jun; Hartl, Daniel L.; Ayroles, Julien F.] Harvard Univ, Dept Organism & Evolutionary Biol, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Clark, Andrew G.; Ayroles, Julien F.] Cornell Univ, Dept Biol Stat & Computat Biol, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Clark, Andrew G.] Cornell Univ, Dept Mol Biol & Genet, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Ayroles, Julien F.] Harvard Univ, Harvard Soc Fellows, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA","Ayroles, JF (reprint author), Harvard Univ, Dept Organism & Evolutionary Biol, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",ayroles@fas.harvard.edu,,,"NIH [GM065169, GM084236, HD059060]; Harvard Society; Harvard Milton Funds; Harvard Prize Fellowship","We are grateful to T.

RAF and MEK inhibitors show remarkable clinical efficacy in BRAF(V600E) melanoma(2,3); however, resistance to these agents remains a formidable challenge(2,4). Global characterization of resistance mechanisms may inform the development of more effective therapeutic combinations. Here we carried out systematic gain-of-function resistance studies by expressing more than 15,500 genes individually in a BRAF(V600E) melanoma cell line treated with RAF, MEK, ERK or combined RAF-MEK inhibitors. These studies revealed a cyclic-AMP-dependent melanocytic signalling network not previously associated with drug resistance, including G-protein-coupled receptors, adenyl cyclase, protein kinase A and cAMP response element binding protein(CREB). Preliminary analysis of biopsies from BRAF (V600E) melanoma patients revealed that phosphorylated (active) CREB was suppressed by RAF-MEK inhibition but restored in relapsing tumours. Expression of transcription factors activated downstream of MAP kinase and cAMP pathways also conferred resistance, including c-FOS, NR4A1, NR4A2 and MITF. Combined treatment with MAPK-pathway and histone-deacetylase inhibitors suppressed MITF expression and cAMP-mediated resistance. Collectively, these data suggest that oncogenic dysregulation of a melanocyte lineage dependency can cause resistance to RAF-MEK-ERK inhibition, which may be overcome by combining signalling-and chromatin-directed therapeutics.","[Johannessen, Cory M.; Johnson, Laura A.; Piccioni, Federica; Townes, Aisha; Donahue, Melanie K.; Narayan, Rajiv; Root, David E.; Garraway, Levi A.] Broad Inst Harvard Univ & Massachusetts Inst Tech, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; [Johannessen, Cory M.; Johnson, Laura A.; Garraway, Levi A.] Dana Farber Canc Inst, Dept Med Oncol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Johannessen, Cory M.; Garraway, Levi A.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Frederick, Dennie T.; Flaherty, Keith T.; Wargo, Jennifer A.] Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Dept Surg Oncol Med Oncol & Dermatol, Boston, MA 02114 USA","Garraway, LA (reprint author), Broad Inst Harvard Univ & Massachusetts Inst Tech, 7 Cambridge Ctr, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA.",Levi_Garraway@dfci.harvard.edu,,,National Institutes of Health (NIH) [DP2 OD002750]; Melanoma Research Alliance; Starr Cancer Consortium; Dr. Miriam and Sheldon G.

Activating mutations in NRAS are prevalent in human myeloproliferative neoplasms and leukaemia(2). Here we show that a single allele of oncogenic Nras(G12D) increases HSC proliferation but also increases reconstituting and self-renewal potential upon serial transplantation in irradiated mice, all prior to leukaemia initiation. Nras(G12D) also confers long-term self-renewal potential to multipotent progenitors. To explore the mechanism by which Nras(G12D) promotes HSC proliferation and self-renewal, we assessed cell-cycle kinetics using H2B-GFP label retention and 5-bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation. Nras(G12D) had a bimodal effect on HSCs, increasing the frequency with which some HSCs divide and reducing the frequency with which others divide. This mirrored bimodal effects on reconstituting potential, as rarely dividing Nras(G12D) HSCs outcompeted wild-type HSCs, whereas frequently dividing Nras(G12D) HSCs did not. Nras(G12D) caused these effects by promoting STAT5 signalling, inducing different transcriptional responses in different subsets of HSCs. One signal can therefore increase HSC proliferation, competitiveness and self-renewal through bimodal effects on HSC gene expression, cycling and reconstituting potential.","[Li, Qing; Bohin, Natacha; Wen, Tiffany; Ng, Victor] Univ Michigan, Dept Med, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Magee, Jeffrey; Morrison, Sean J.] Univ Texas SW Med Ctr Dallas, Dept Pediat, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Dallas, TX 75390 USA; [Magee, Jeffrey; Morrison, Sean J.] Univ Texas SW Med Ctr Dallas, Childrens Res Inst, Dallas, TX 75390 USA; [Chen, Shann-Ching] St Jude Childrens Res Hosp, Dept Pathol, Memphis, TN 38105 USA; [Shannon, Kevin] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Pediat, San Francisco, CA 94158 USA","Li, Q (reprint author), Univ Michigan, Dept Med, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",lqing@umich.edu; Sean.Morrison@UTSouthwestern.edu,,"Morrison, Sean/0000-0003-1587-8329",Cancer Prevention and Research Institute of Texas; NIH [K08-CA-134649]; V Foundation V Scholar award,"S.J.M. is a Howard Hughes Medical Institute Investigator and the Mary McDermott Cook Chair in Pediatric Genetics.

Across the plant kingdom, jasmonates act as elicitors of the production of bioactive secondary metabolites that serve in defence against attackers(1-3). Knowledge of the conserved jasmonate perception and early signalling machineries is increasing(3-6), but the downstream mechanisms that regulate defence metabolism remain largely unknown. Here we show that, in the legume Medicago truncatula, jasmonate recruits the endoplasmic-reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) quality control system to manage the production of triterpene saponins, widespread bioactive compounds that share a biogenic origin with sterols(7-9). An ERAD-type RING membrane-anchor E3 ubiquitin ligase is co-expressed with saponin synthesis enzymes to control the activity of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase (HMGR), the rate-limiting enzyme in the supply of the ubiquitous terpene precursor isopentenyl diphosphate. Thus, unrestrained bioactive saponin accumulation is prevented and plant development and integrity secured. This control apparatus is equivalent to the ERAD system that regulates sterol synthesis in yeasts and mammals but that uses distinct E3 ubiquitin ligases, of the HMGR degradation 1 (HRD1) type, to direct destruction of HMGR(10-13). Hence, the general principles for the management of sterol and triterpene saponin biosynthesis are conserved across eukaryotes but can be controlled by divergent regulatory cues.","[Pollier, Jacob; Moses, Tessa; Gonzalez-Guzman, Miguel; De Geyter, Nathan; Vanden Bossche, Robin; Marhavy, Peter; Morreel, Kris; Goormachtig, Sofie; Goossens, Alain] VIB, Dept Plant Syst Biol, B-9052 Ghent, Belgium; [Pollier, Jacob; Moses, Tessa; Gonzalez-Guzman, Miguel; De Geyter, Nathan; Vanden Bossche, Robin; Marhavy, Peter; Morreel, Kris; Goormachtig, Sofie; Goossens, Alain] Univ Ghent, Dept Plant Biotechnol & Bioinformat, B-9052 Ghent, Belgium; [Moses, Tessa; Thevelein, Johan M.] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Inst Bot & Microbiol, Mol Cell Biol Lab, B-3001 Louvain, Belgium; [Moses, Tessa; Thevelein, Johan M.] VIB, Dept Mol Microbiol, B-3001 Louvain, Belgium; [Lippens, Saskia; Kremer, Anna; Guerin, Christopher J.] VIB, VIB Bio Imaging Core Gent, B-9052 Ghent, Belgium; [Lippens, Saskia; Kremer, Anna; Guerin, Christopher J.] VIB, Inflammat Res Ctr, B-9052 Ghent, Belgium; [Tava, Aldo] Ctr Ric Prod Foraggere & Lattiero Casearie, Consiglio Ric & Sperimentaz Agr, I-26900 Lodi, Italy; [Oleszek, Wieslaw] State Res Inst, Inst Soil Sci & Plant Cultivat, Dept Biochem, PL-24100 Pulawy, Poland; [Campos, Narciso] Univ Barcelona, Fac Biol, Dept Bioquim & Biol Mol, E-08028 Barcelona, Spain; [Campos, Narciso] Consorci CSIC IRTA UAB UB, Ctr Recerca Agrigen, Dept Mol Genet, Barcelona 08193, Spain","Goossens, A (reprint author), VIB, Dept Plant Syst Biol, Technol Pk 927, B-9052 Ghent, Belgium.",alain.goossens@psb.vib-ugent.be,"Pollier, Jacob/B-3091-2012; Gonzalez-Guzman, Miguel/F-2318-2014","Pollier, Jacob/0000-0002-1134-9238; Gonzalez-Guzman, Miguel/0000-0003-1000-9255; Moses, Tessa/0000-0001-9366-4727; Thevelein, Johan/0000-0002-2626-0180; Campos, Narciso/0000-0002-9685-0549; Goormachtig, Sofie/0000-0001-6195-9889; Goossens, Alain/0000-0002-1599-551X",Agency for Innovation by Science and Technology in Flanders [SBO040093]; European Union [222716]; Spanish Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad [BFU2011-24208]; VIB International PhD Fellowship Program; Agency for Innovation by Science and Technology,"We thank W.

However, the mechanisms that integrate these diverse cues remain undefined. Here we demonstrate that mice with an intestinal epithelial cell (IEC)-specific deletion of the epigenome-modifying enzyme histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3(Delta IEC) mice) exhibited extensive dysregulation of IEC-intrinsic gene expression, including decreased basal expression of genes associated with antimicrobial defence. Critically, conventionally housed HDAC3(Delta IEC) mice demonstrated loss of Paneth cells, impaired IEC function and alterations in the composition of intestinal commensal bacteria. In addition, HDAC3(Delta IEC) mice showed significantly increased susceptibility to intestinal damage and inflammation, indicating that epithelial expression of HDAC3 has a central role in maintaining intestinal homeostasis. Re-derivation of HDAC3(Delta IEC) mice into germ-free conditions revealed that dysregulated IEC gene expression, Paneth cell homeostasis and intestinal barrier function were largely restored in the absence of commensal bacteria. Although the specific mechanisms through which IEC-intrinsic HDAC3 expression regulates these complex phenotypes remain to be determined, these data indicate that HDAC3 is a critical factor that integrates commensal-bacteria-derived signals to calibrate epithelial cell responses required to establish normal host-commensal relationships and maintain intestinal homeostasis.","[Alenghat, Theresa; Osborne, Lisa C.; Saenz, Steven A.; Kobuley, Dmytro; Ziegler, Carly G.

This defect in host defence has generally been ascribed to the immaturity of neonatal immune cells; however, the degree of hyporesponsiveness is highly variable and depends on the stimulation conditions(1-7). These discordant responses illustrate the need for a more unified explanation for why immunity is compromised in neonates. Here we show that physiologically enriched CD71(+) erythroid cells in neonatalmice and human cord blood have distinctive immunosuppressive properties. The production of innate immune protective cytokines by adult cells is diminished after transfer to neonatal mice or after co-culture with neonatal splenocytes. Neonatal CD71(+) cells express the enzyme arginase-2, and arginase activity is essential for the immunosuppressive properties of these cells because molecular inhibition of this enzyme or supplementation with L-arginine overrides immunosuppression. In addition, the ablation of CD71(+) cells in neonatal mice, or the decline in number of these cells as postnatal development progresses parallels the loss of suppression, and restored resistance to the perinatal pathogens Listeria monocytogenes and Escherichia coli(8,9). However, CD71(+) cell-mediated susceptibility to infection is counterbalanced by CD71(+) cell-mediated protection against aberrant immune cell activation in the intestine, where colonization with commensal microorganisms occurs swiftly after parturition(10,11). Conversely, circumventing such colonization by using antimicrobials or gnotobiotic germ-free mice overrides these protective benefits. Thus, CD71(+) cells quench the excessive inflammation induced by abrupt colonization with commensal microorganisms after parturition. This finding challenges the idea that the susceptibility of neonates to infection reflects immune-cell-intrinsic defects and instead highlights processes that are developmentally more essential and inadvertently mitigate innate immune protection. We anticipate that these results will spark renewed investigation into the need for immunosuppression in neonates, as well as improved strategies for augmenting host defence in this vulnerable population.","[Elahi, Shokrollah; Ertelt, James M.; Kinder, Jeremy M.; Jiang, Tony T.; Zhang, Xuzhe; Xin, Lijun; Chaturvedi, Vandana; Qualls, Joseph E.; Way, Sing Sing] Cincinnati Childrens Hosp Med Ctr, Div Infect Dis, Cincinnati, OH 45229 USA; [Elahi, Shokrollah; Ertelt, James M.; Kinder, Jeremy M.; Jiang, Tony T.; Zhang, Xuzhe; Xin, Lijun; Chaturvedi, Vandana; Qualls, Joseph E.; Way, Sing Sing] Cincinnati Childrens Hosp Med Ctr, Perinatal Inst, Cincinnati, OH 45229 USA; [Strong, Beverly S.; Shaaban, Aimen F.] Cincinnati Childrens Hosp Med Ctr, Ctr Fetal Cellular & Mol Therapy, Cincinnati, OH 45229 USA; [Steinbrecher, Kris A.] Cincinnati Childrens Hosp Med Ctr, Div Gastroenterol, Cincinnati, OH 45229 USA; [Kalfa, Theodosia A.] Cincinnati Childrens Hosp Med Ctr, Div Hematol, Cincinnati, OH 45229 USA","Way, SS (reprint author), Cincinnati Childrens Hosp Med Ctr, Div Infect Dis, 3333 Burnet Ave, Cincinnati, OH 45229 USA.",singsing.way@cchmc.org,,"Shaaban, Aimen/0000-0002-9459-107X; Kinder, Jeremy/0000-0001-5145-1344; Way, Sing Sing/0000-0001-8948-1952","NIAID [R01AI087830, R01AI100934]; NHLBI [R01HL103745]; Burroughs Wellcome Fund","We thank D.

Current evidence indicates that brown adipocytes arise from Myf5(+) dermotomal precursors through the action of PR domain containing protein 16 (PRDM16) transcriptional complex(1,2). However, the enzymatic component of the molecular switch that determines lineage specification of brown adipocytes remains unknown. Here we show that euchromatic histone-lysine N-methyltransferase 1 (EHMT1) is an essential BAT-enriched lysine methyltransferase in the PRDM16 transcriptional complex and controls brown adipose cell fate. Loss of EHMT1 in brown adipocytes causes a severe loss of brown fat characteristics and induces muscle differentiation in vivo through demethylation of histone 3 lysine 9 (H3K9me2 and 3) of the muscle-selective gene promoters. Conversely, EHMT1 expression positively regulates the BAT-selective thermogenic program by stabilizing the PRDM16 protein. Notably, adipose-specific deletion of EHMT1 leads to a marked reduction of BAT-mediated adaptive thermogenesis, obesity and systemic insulin resistance. These data indicate that EHMT1 is an essential enzymatic switch that controls brown adipose cell fate and energy homeostasis.","[Ohno, Haruya; Shinoda, Kosaku; Ohyama, Kana; Sharp, Louis Z.; Kajimura, Shingo] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Cell & Tissue Biol, UCSF Diabet Ctr, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA","Kajimura, S (reprint author), Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Cell & Tissue Biol, UCSF Diabet Ctr, 35 Med Ctr Way, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA.",skajimura@diabetes.ucsf.edu,,,"National Institutes of Health [DK087853, DK97441]; DERC center [DK63720]; University of California, San Francisco Program for Breakthrough Biomedical Research program; Pew Charitable Trust; PRESTO from the Japan Science and Technology Agency; Manpei Suzuki Diabetes Foundation; Japan Society for the Promotion of Science","We are grateful to A.

PPR proteins, which are found in exceptionally large numbers in the mitochondria and chloroplasts of terrestrial plants(1-5), recognize single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) in a modular fashion(6-8). The maize chloroplast protein PPR10 binds to two similar RNA sequences from the ATPI-ATPH and PSAJ-RPL33 intergenic regions, referred to as ATPH and PSAJ, respectively(9,10). By protecting the target RNA elements from 5' or 3' exonucleases, PPR10 defines the corresponding 5' and 3' messenger RNA termini(9-11). Despite rigorous functional characterizations, the structural basis of sequence-specific ssRNA recognition by PPR proteins remains to be elucidated. Here we report the crystal structures of PPR10 in RNA-free and RNA-bound states at resolutions of 2.85 and 2.45 angstrom, respectively. In the absence of RNA binding, the nineteen repeats of PPR10 are assembled into a right-handed superhelical spiral. PPR10 forms an antiparallel, intertwined homodimer and exhibits considerable conformational changes upon binding to its target ssRNA, an 18-nucleotide PSAJ element. Six nucleotides of PSAJ are specifically recognized by six corresponding PPR10 repeats following the predicted code. The molecular basis for the specific and modular recognition of RNA bases A, G and U is revealed. The structural elucidation of RNA recognition by PPR proteins provides an important framework for potential biotechnological applications of PPR proteins in RNA-related research areas.","[Yin, Ping; Li, Quanxiu; Liu, Ying; Wang, Jiawei; Yan, Nieng] Tsinghua Univ, State Key Lab Biomembrane & Membrane Biotechnol, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China; [Yin, Ping; Li, Quanxiu; Yan, Chuangye; Liu, Ying; Liu, Junjie; Wang, Hong-Wei; Wang, Jiawei; Shi, Yigong; Yan, Nieng] Tsinghua Univ, Ctr Struct Biol, Sch Life Sci, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China; [Yin, Ping; Li, Quanxiu; Yan, Chuangye; Liu, Ying; Liu, Junjie; Wang, Hong-Wei; Wang, Jiawei; Shi, Yigong; Yan, Nieng] Tsinghua Univ, Sch Med, Tsinghua Peking Ctr Life Sci, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China; [Yan, Chuangye; Liu, Junjie; Wang, Hong-Wei; Shi, Yigong] Tsinghua Univ, Minist Educ, Key Lab Prot Sci, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China; [Yu, Feng; He, Jianhua] Chinese Acad Sci, Shanghai Inst Appl Phys, Shanghai 201204, Peoples R China; [Wang, Zheng; Long, Jiafu] Nankai Univ, State Key Lab Med Chem Biol, Tianjin 300071, Peoples R China; [Wang, Zheng; Long, Jiafu] Nankai Univ, Coll Life Sci, Tianjin 300071, Peoples R China; [Zhu, Jian-Kang] Chinese Acad Sci, Shanghai Inst Biol Sci, Shanghai Ctr Plant Stress Biol, Shanghai 200032, Peoples R China; [Zhu, Jian-Kang] Purdue Univ, Dept Hort & Landscape Architecture, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA","Yan, NE (reprint author), Tsinghua Univ, State Key Lab Biomembrane & Membrane Biotechnol, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China.",nyan@tsinghua.edu.cn,"Long, Jiafu/B-7420-2012; Zhu, Jian-Kang/F-7658-2011","Long, Jiafu/0000-0002-6625-0147; Zhu, Jian-Kang/0000-0001-5134-731X","Ministry of Science and Technology [2011CB910501]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [91017011, 31070644, 31021002, 31200567]; Howard Hughes Medical Institute","We thank X.

They recognize normal and modified lipoproteins, as well as pathogen-associated molecular patterns. The family consists of three members: SR-BI (which delivers cholesterol to the liver and steroidogenic organs and is a co-receptor for hepatitis C virus), LIMP-2/LGP85 (which mediates lysosomal delivery of beta-glucocerebrosidase and serves as a receptor for enterovirus 71 and coxsackieviruses) and CD36 (a fatty-acid transporter and receptor for phagocytosis of effete cells and Plasmodium-infected erythrocytes). Notably, CD36 is also a receptor for modified lipoproteins and beta-amyloid, and has been implicated in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis and of Alzheimer's disease(1). Despite their prominent roles in health and disease, understanding the function and abnormalities of the CD36 family members has been hampered by the paucity of information about their structure. Here we determine the crystal structure of LIMP-2 and infer, by homology modelling, the structure of SR-BI and CD36. LIMP-2 shows a helical bundle where beta-glucocerebrosidase binds, and where ligands are most likely to bind to SR-BI and CD36. Remarkably, the crystal structure also shows the existence of a large cavity that traverses the entire length of the molecule. Mutagenesis of SR-BI indicates that the cavity serves as a tunnel through which cholesterol(esters) are delivered from the bound lipoprotein to the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane. We provide evidence supporting a model(2) whereby lipidic constituents of the ligands attached to the receptor surface are handed off to the membrane through the tunnel, accounting for the selective lipid transfer characteristic of SR-BI and CD36.","[Neculai, Dante; Collins, Richard F.; Plumb, Jonathan; Trimble, William S.; Grinstein, Sergio] Hosp Sick Children, Cell Biol Program, Toronto, ON M5G 1X8, Canada; [Schwake, Michael; Zunke, Friederike; Peters, Judith; Saftig, Paul] Univ Kiel, Inst Biochem, D-24118 Kiel, Germany; [Schwake, Michael] Univ Bielefeld, Fak Chem, D-33615 Bielefeld, Germany; [Ravichandran, Mani; Neculai, Mirela; Loppnau, Peter; Pizarro, Juan Carlos; Seitova, Alma; Dhe-Paganon, Sirano] Univ Toronto, Struct Genom Consortium, Toronto, ON M5G 1L7, Canada; [Pizarro, Juan Carlos] Tulane Univ, Dept Trop Med, New Orleans, LA 70118 USA; [Trimble, William S.; Grinstein, Sergio] Univ Toronto, Dept Biochem, Toronto, ON M5S 1A8, Canada; [Grinstein, Sergio] St Michaels Hosp, Li Ka Shing Knowledge Inst, Keenan Res Ctr, Toronto, ON M5C 1N8, Canada; [Dhe-Paganon, Sirano] Dana Farber Canc Inst, Dept Canc Biol, Boston, MA 02215 USA","Grinstein, S (reprint author), Hosp Sick Children, Cell Biol Program, 555 Univ Ave, Toronto, ON M5G 1X8, Canada.",sergio.grinstein@sickkids.ca,"Saftig, Paul/A-7966-2010; Neculai, Dante/A-9923-2011",,"Canadian Institutes for Health Research [MOP-102474, MOP-126069]; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft [GRK1459, SFB877]; Bohringer Ingelheim Fonds; Canada Research Chair in Molecular Cell Biology; Canadian Institutes for Health Research; Canada Foundation for Innovation; Genome Canada through the Ontario Genomics Institute; GlaxoSmithKline; Karolinska Institutet; Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation; Ontario Innovation Trust; Ontario Ministry for Research and Innovation; Merck Co.; Novartis Research Foundation; Swedish Agency for Innovation Systems; Swedish Foundation for Strategic Research; Wellcome Trust","We thank W.

It is often unclear how much of this variation derives from chance, external signals, or attempts by individual cells to exert autonomous phenotypic programs. By observing thousands of cells for hundreds of consecutive generations under constant conditions, we dissect the stochastic decision between a solitary, motile state and a chained, sessile state in Bacillus subtilis. We show that the motile state is 'memoryless', exhibiting no autonomous control over the time spent in the state. In contrast, the time spent as connected chains of cells is tightly controlled, enforcing coordination among related cells in the multicellular state. We show that the three-protein regulatory circuit governing the decision is modular, as initiation and maintenance of chaining are genetically separable functions. As stimulation of the same initiating pathway triggers biofilm formation, we argue that autonomous timing allows a trial commitment to multicellularity that external signals could extend.","[Norman, Thomas M.; Lord, Nathan D.; Paulsson, Johan] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Systemat Bot, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Losick, Richard] Harvard Univ, Dept Mol & Cellular Biol, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA","Paulsson, J (reprint author), Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Systemat Bot, Boston, MA 02115 USA.",Johan_Paulsson@hms.harvard.edu; losick@mcb.harvard.edu,,,"National Science Foundation [ECS-0335765]; NIH [GM18568, GM081563]","We thank A.

Here we use natural genetic variation as an in vivo mutagenesis screen to assess the genome-wide effects of sequence variation on lineage-determining and signal-specific transcription factor binding, epigenomics and transcriptional outcomes in primary macrophages from different mouse strains. We find substantial genetic evidence to support the concept that lineage-determining transcription factors define epigenetic and transcriptomic states by selecting enhancer-like regions in the genome in a collaborative fashion and facilitating binding of signal-dependent factors. This hierarchical model of transcription factor function suggests that limited sets of genomic data for lineage-determining transcription factors and informative histone modifications can be used for the prioritization of disease-associated regulatory variants.","[Heinz, S.; Romanoski, C.

Levels of adiponectin in plasma are reduced in obesity, which causes insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. Thus, orally active small molecules that bind to and activate AdipoR1 and AdipoR2 could ameliorate obesity-related diseases such as type 2 diabetes. Here we report the identification of orally active synthetic small-molecule AdipoR agonists. One of these compounds, AdipoR agonist (AdipoRon), bound to both AdipoR1 and AdipoR2 in vitro. AdipoRon showed very similar effects to adiponectin in muscle and liver, such as activation of AMPK and PPAR-alpha pathways, and ameliorated insulin resistance and glucose intolerance in mice fed a high-fat diet, which was completely obliterated in AdipoR1 and AdipoR2 double-knockout mice. Moreover, AdipoRon ameliorated diabetes of genetically obese rodent model db/db mice, and prolonged the shortened lifespan of db/db mice on a high-fat diet. Thus, orally active AdipoR agonists such as AdipoRon are a promising therapeutic approach for the treatment of obesity-related diseases such as type 2 diabetes.","[Okada-Iwabu, Miki; Yamauchi, Toshimasa; Iwabu, Masato; Hamagami, Ken-ichi; Matsuda, Koichi; Yamaguchi, Mamiko; Ueki, Kohjiro; Kadowaki, Takashi] Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Med, Dept Diabet & Metab Dis, Tokyo 1130033, Japan; [Okada-Iwabu, Miki; Yamauchi, Toshimasa; Iwabu, Masato; Kadowaki, Takashi] Univ Tokyo, Dept Integrated Mol Sci Metab Dis, 22nd Century Med & Res Ctr, Tokyo 1130033, Japan; [Okada-Iwabu, Miki; Yamauchi, Toshimasa; Kadowaki, Takashi] Univ Tokyo, Dept Mol Med Sci Metab Regulat, 22nd Century Med & Res Ctr, Tokyo 1130033, Japan; [Honma, Teruki; Tanabe, Hiroaki; Kimura-Someya, Tomomi; Shirouzu, Mikako; Tanaka, Akiko; Yokoyama, Shigeyuki] RIKEN Syst & Struct Biol Ctr, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2300045, Japan; [Ogata, Hitomi; Tokuyama, Kumpei] Univ Tsukuba, Grad Sch Comprehens Human Sci, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058577, Japan; [Nagano, Tetsuo; Tanaka, Akiko] Univ Tokyo, Open Innovat Ctr Drug Discovery, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo 1130033, Japan; [Yokoyama, Shigeyuki] Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Sci, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo 1130033, Japan","Kadowaki, T (reprint author), Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Med, Dept Diabet & Metab Dis, Tokyo 1130033, Japan.",tyamau-tky@umin.net; kadowaki-3im@h.u-tokyo.ac.jp,"Shirouzu, Mikako/A-6521-2016; Kimura-Someya, Tomomi/C-4169-2017; Yokoyama, Shigeyuki/N-6911-2015","Yokoyama, Shigeyuki/0000-0003-3133-7338","Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology of Japan [20229008, 25221307, 23689048]; Translational Systems Biology and Medicine Initiative from the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology of Japan; Translational Research Network Program from the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology of Japan; Cabinet Office, Government of Japan","We thank N.

They could be intermediate-mass black holes (more than 100-1,000 solar masses, M-circle dot) radiating at sub-maximal (sub-Eddington) rates, as in Galactic black-hole X-ray binaries but with larger, cooler accretion disks(3-5). Alternatively, they could be stellar-mass black holes radiating at Eddington or super-Eddington rates(2,6). On its discovery, M 101 ULX-1(4,7) had a luminosity of 3 x 10(39) erg s(-1) and a supersoft thermal disk spectrum with an exceptionally low temperature-uncomplicated by photons energized by a corona of hot electrons-more consistent with the expected appearance of an accreting intermediate-mass black hole(3,4). Here we report optical spectroscopic monitoring of M 101 ULX-1. We confirm the previous suggestion(8) that the system contains a Wolf-Rayet star, and reveal that the orbital period is 8.2 days. The black hole has a minimum mass of 5 M-circle dot, and more probably a mass of 20 M-circle dot-30 M-circle dot, but we argue that it is very unlikely to be an intermediate-mass black hole. Therefore, its exceptionally soft spectra at high Eddington ratios violate the expectations for accretion onto stellar-mass black holes(9-11). Accretion must occur from captured stellar wind, which has hitherto been thought to be so inefficient that it could not power an ultraluminous source(12,13).","[Liu, Ji-Feng; Bai, Yu; Justham, Stephen] Chinese Acad Sci, Natl Astron Observ, Key Lab Opt Astron, Beijing 100012, Peoples R China; [Bregman, Joel N.] Univ Michigan, Dept Astron, Ann Arbor, MI 48105 USA; [Crowther, Paul] Univ Sheffield, Dept Phys & Astron, Sheffield S3 7RH, S Yorkshire, England","Liu, JF (reprint author), Chinese Acad Sci, Natl Astron Observ, Key Lab Opt Astron, 20A Datun Rd, Beijing 100012, Peoples R China.",jfliu@nao.cas.cn,"Bai, Yu/E-2902-2016","Bregman, Joel/0000-0001-6276-9526; Crowther, Paul/0000-0001-6000-6920","NASA [PF6-70043]; Chinese Academy of Sciences [KJCX2-EW-T01]; National Science Foundation of China [NSFC-11273028, NSFC-11333004]","We thank J.

Fundamental quantities in spintronics are the population relaxation time (T-1) and the phase memory time (T-2): T-1 measures the lifetime of a classical bit, in this case embodied by a spin oriented either parallel or antiparallel to an external magnetic field, and T-2 measures the corresponding lifetime of a quantum bit, encoded in the phase of the quantum state. Here we establish that these times are surprisingly long for a common, low-cost and chemically modifiable organic semiconductor, the blue pigment copper phthalocyanine(3), in easily processed thin-film form of the type used for device fabrication. At 5 K, a temperature reachable using inexpensive closed-cycle refrigerators, T-1 and T-2 are respectively 59 ms and 2.6 mu s, and at 80 K, which is just above the boiling point of liquid nitrogen, they are respectively 10 ms and 1 ms, demonstrating that the performance of thin-film copper phthalocyanine is superior to that of single-molecule magnets over the same temperature range(4). T-2 is more than two orders of magnitude greater than the duration of the spin manipulation pulses, which suggests that copper phthalocyanine holds promise for quantum information processing, and the long T-1 indicates possibilities for medium-term storage of classical bits in all-organic devices on plastic substrates.","[Warner, Marc; Morley, Gavin W.; Stoneham, A.

Ferroelectric oxides are also stable in a wide range of mechanical, chemical and thermal conditions and can be fabricated using low-cost methods such as sol-gel thin-film deposition and sputtering(3,5). Recent work(3,5,11) has shown how a decrease in ferroelectric layer thickness and judicious engineering of domain structures and ferroelectric-electrode interfaces can greatly increase the current harvested from ferroelectric absorber materials, increasing the power conversion efficiency from about 10(-4) to about 0.5 per cent. Further improvements in photovoltaic efficiency have been inhibited by the wide bandgaps (2.7-4 electronvolts) of ferroelectric oxides, which allow the use of only 8-20 per cent of the solar spectrum. Here we describe a family of single-phase solid oxide solutions made from low-cost and non-toxic elements using conventional solid-state methods: [KNbO3](1-x)[BaNi1/2Nb1/2O3-delta](x) (KBNNO). These oxides exhibit both ferroelectricity and a wide variation of direct bandgaps in the range 1.1-3.8 electronvolts. In particular, the x = 0.1 composition is polar at room temperature, has a direct bandgap of 1.39 electronvolts and has a photocurrent density approximately 50 times larger than that of the classic ferroelectric (Pb,La)(Zr,Ti)O-3 material. The ability of KBNNO to absorb three to six times more solar energy than the current ferroelectric materials suggests a route to viable ferroelectric semiconductor-based cells for solar energy conversion and other applications.","[Grinberg, Ilya; Gou, Gaoyang; Rappe, Andrew M.] Univ Penn, Dept Chem, Makineni Theoret Labs, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [West, D.

Here we show that the meteorite Northwest Africa (NWA) 7533 (paired with meteorite NWA 7034(3)) is a polymict breccia consisting of a fine-grained interclast matrix containing clasts of igneous-textured rocks and fine-grained clast-laden impact melt rocks. High abundances of meteoritic siderophiles (for example nickel and iridium) found throughout the rock reach a level in the fine-grained portions equivalent to 5 per cent CI chondritic input, which is comparable to the highest levels found in lunar breccias. Furthermore, analyses of three leucocratic monzonite clasts show a correlation between nickel, iridium and magnesium consistent with differentiation from impact melts. Compositionally, all the fine-grained material is alkalic basalt, chemically identical (except for sulphur, chlorine and zinc) to soils from Gusev crater. Thus, we propose that NWA 7533 is a Martian regolith breccia. It contains zircons for which we measured an age of 4,428 +/- 25 million years, which were later disturbed 1,712 +/- 85 million years ago. This evidence for early crustal differentiation implies that the Martian crust, and its volatile inventory(4), formed in about the first 100 million years of Martian history, coeval with earliest crust formation on the Moon(5) and the Earth(6). In addition, incompatible element abundances in clast-laden impact melt rocks and interclast matrix provide a geochemical estimate of the average thickness of the Martian crust (50 kilometres) comparable to that estimated geophysically(2,7).","[Humayun, M.] Florida State Univ, Dept Earth Ocean & Atmospher Sci, Tallahassee, FL 32310 USA; [Humayun, M.] Florida State Univ, Natl High Magnet Field Lab, Tallahassee, FL 32310 USA; [Nemchin, A.; Grange, M.] Curtin Univ, Dept Appl Geol, Perth, WA 6845, Australia; [Zanda, B.; Hewins, R.

A leading hypothesis poses that exotic plant dominance is self-reinforced by impacts on ecosystem processes, leading to persistent stable states(2-6). Invaders have been documented to modify fire regimes, alter soil nutrients or shift microbial communities in ways that feed back to benefit themselves over competitors(2,5-7). However, few studies have followed invasions through time to ask whether ecosystem impacts and feedbacks persist(8,9). Here we return to woodland sites in Hawai'i Volcanoes National Park that were invaded by exotic C-4 grasses in the 1960s, the ecosystem impacts of which were studied intensively in the 1990s(10-12). We show that positive feedbacks between exotic grasses and soil nitrogen cycling have broken down, but rather than facilitating native vegetation, the weakening feedbacks facilitate new exotic species. Data from the 1990s showed that exotic grasses increased nitrogen-mineralization rates by two-to fourfold, but were nitrogen-limited(10,12,13). Thus, the impacts of the invader created a positive feedback early in the invasion. We now show that annual net soil nitrogen mineralization has since dropped to pre-invasion levels. In addition, a seedling outplanting experiment that varied soil nitrogen and grass competition demonstrates that the changing impacts of grasses do not favour native species re-establishment. Instead, decreased nitrogen availability most benefits another aggressive invader, the nitrogen-fixing tree Morella faya. Long-term studies of invasions may reveal that ecosystem impacts and feedbacks shift over time, but that this may not benefit native species recovery.","[Yelenik, Stephanie G.; D'Antonio, Carla M.] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Ecol Evolut & Marine Biol, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA","Yelenik, SG (reprint author), US Geol Survey, Pacific Isl Ecosyst Res Ctr, Hawaii Natl Pk, HI 96718 USA.",syelenik@usgs.gov,,"Yelenik, Stephanie/0000-0002-9011-0769",National Science Foundation [DEB 1029168],"We thank M.

A unique mode of inhibitory control may be provided by inhibitory neurons that specifically suppress the firing of other inhibitory neurons. Such disinhibition could lead to the selective amplification of local processing and serve the important computational functions of gating and gain modulation(8,9). Although several interneuron populations are known to target other interneurons to varying degrees(10-15), little is known about interneurons specializing in disinhibition and their in vivo function. Here we show that a class of interneurons that express vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) mediates disinhibitory control in multiple areas of neocortex and is recruited by reinforcement signals. By combining optogenetic activation with single-cell recordings, we examined the functional role of VIP interneurons in awake mice, and investigated the underlying circuit mechanisms in vitro in auditory and medial prefrontal cortices. We identified a basic disinhibitory circuit module in which activation of VIP interneurons transiently suppresses primarily somatostatin- and a fraction of parvalbumin-expressing inhibitory interneurons that specialize in the control of the input and output of principal cells, respectively(3,6,16,17). During the performance of an auditory discrimination task, reinforcement signals (reward and punishment) strongly and uniformly activated VIP neurons in auditory cortex, and in turn VIP recruitment increased the gain of a functional subpopulation of principal neurons. These results reveal a specific cell type and microcircuit underlying disinhibitory control in cortex and demonstrate that it is activated under specific behavioural conditions.","[Pi, Hyun-Jae; Hangya, Balazs; Kvitsiani, Duda; Sanders, Joshua I.; Huang, Z.

Until now, preserved tissues have been the main source for most comparative studies between humans, chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) and bonobos (Pan paniscus)(1,2). However, these tissue samples do not fairly represent the distinctive traits of live cell behaviour and are not amenable to genetic manipulation. We propose that induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells could be a unique biological resource to determine relevant phenotypical differences between human and NHPs, and that those differences could have potential adaptation and speciation value. Here we describe the generation and initial characterization of iPS cells from chimpanzees and bonobos as new tools to explore factors that may have contributed to great ape evolution. Comparative gene expression analysis of human and NHP iPS cells revealed differences in the regulation of long interspersed element-1 (L1, also known as LINE-1) transposons. A force of change in mammalian evolution, L1 elements are retrotransposons that have remained active during primate evolution(3-5). Decreased levels of L1-restricting factors APOBEC3B (also known as A3B)(6) and PIWIL2 (ref. 7) in NHP iPS cells correlated with increased L1 mobility and endogenous L1 messenger RNA levels. Moreover, results from the manipulation of A3B and PIWIL2 levels in iPS cells supported a causal inverse relationship between levels of these proteins and L1 retrotransposition. Finally, we found increased copy numbers of species-specific L1 elements in the genome of chimpanzees compared to humans, supporting the idea that increased L1 mobility in NHPs is not limited to iPS cells in culture and may have also occurred in the germ line or embryonic cells developmentally upstream to germline specification during primate evolution. We propose that differences in L1 mobility may have differentially shaped the genomes of humans and NHPs and could have continuing adaptive significance.","[Marchetto, Maria C.

Information exchange allowing immune cells to collaborate is generally attributed to soluble protein factors secreted by pathogen-sensing cells. Cytokines, such as type I interferons (IFNs), serve to alert noninfected cells to the possibility of pathogen challenge(1). Moreover, in conjunction with chemokines they can instruct specialized immune cells to contain and eradicate microbial infection. Several receptors and signalling pathways exist that couple pathogen sensing to the induction of cytokines, whereas cytosolic recognition of nucleic acids seems to be exquisitely important for the activation of type I IFNs, master regulators of antiviral immunity(2). Cytosolic DNA is sensed by the receptor cyclic GMP-AMP (cGAMP) synthase (cGAS), which catalyses the synthesis of the second messenger cGAMP(2'-5')(3-8). This molecule in turn activates the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-resident receptor STING(9-11), thereby inducing an antiviral state and the secretion of type I IFNs. Here we find in murine and human cells that cGAS-synthesized cGAMP (2'-5') is transferred from producing cells to neighbouring cells through gap junctions, where it promotes STING activation and thus antiviral immunity independently of type I IFN signalling. In line with the limited cargo specificity of connexins, the proteins that assemble gap junction channels, most connexins tested were able to confer this bystander immunity, thus indicating a broad physiological relevance of this local immune collaboration. Collectively, these observations identify cGAS-triggered cGAMP(2'-5') transfer as a novel host strategy that serves to rapidly convey antiviral immunity in a transcription-independent, horizontal manner.","[Ablasser, Andrea; Schmid-Burgk, Jonathan L.; Hemmerling, Inga; Schmidt, Tobias; Hornung, Veit] Univ Bonn, Univ Hosp, Inst Clin Chem & Clin Pharmacol, D-53127 Bonn, Germany; [Horvath, Gabor L.; Latz, Eicke] Univ Bonn, Univ Hosp, Inst Innate Immun, D-53127 Bonn, Germany; [Latz, Eicke] Univ Massachusetts, Sch Med, Div Infect Dis & Immunol, Dept Med, Worcester, MA 01605 USA","Hornung, V (reprint author), Univ Bonn, Univ Hosp, Inst Clin Chem & Clin Pharmacol, D-53127 Bonn, Germany.",veit.hornung@uni-bonn.de,"Horvath, Gabor/J-3917-2014; Latz, Eicke/H-3951-2014","Horvath, Gabor/0000-0003-0309-595X; Latz, Eicke/0000-0003-1488-5666; Schmid-Burgk, Jonathan/0000-0003-0988-2487; Hornung, Veit/0000-0002-4150-194X","Studienstiftung des Deutschen Volkes; BONFOR; excellence cluster ImmunoSensation; German Research Foundation [SFB670, SFB704]; European Research Council [ERC 243046]","We thank M.

An ongoing outbreak of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus(2) suggests that this group of viruses remains a key threat and that their distribution is wider than previously recognized. Although bats have been suggested to be the natural reservoirs of both viruses(3-5), attempts to isolate the progenitor virus of SARS-CoV from bats have been unsuccessful. Diverse SARS-like coronaviruses (SL-CoVs) have now been reported from bats in China, Europe and Africa(5-8), but none is considered a direct progenitor of SARS-CoV because of their phylogenetic disparity from this virus and the inability of their spike proteins to use the SARS-CoV cellular receptor molecule, the human angiotensin converting enzyme II (ACE2)(9,10). Here we report whole-genome sequences of two novel bat coronaviruses from Chinese horseshoe bats (family: Rhinolophidae) in Yunnan, China: RsSHC014 and Rs3367. These viruses are far more closely related to SARS-CoV than any previously identified bat coronaviruses, particularly in the receptor binding domain of the spike protein. Most importantly, we report the first recorded isolation of a live SL-CoV (bat SL-CoV-WIV1) from bat faecal samples in Vero E6 cells, which has typical coronavirus morphology, 99.9% sequence identity to Rs3367 and uses ACE2 from humans, civets and Chinese horseshoe bats for cell entry. Preliminary in vitro testing indicates that WIV1 also has a broad species tropism. Our results provide the strongest evidence to date that Chinese horseshoe bats are natural reservoirs of SARS-CoV, and that intermediate hosts may not be necessary for direct human infection by some bat SL-CoVs. They also highlight the importance of pathogen-discovery programs targeting high-risk wildlife groups in emerging disease hotspots as a strategy for pandemic preparedness.","[Ge, Xing-Yi; Li, Jia-Lu; Yang, Xing-Lou; Hu, Ben; Zhang, Wei; Peng, Cheng; Zhang, Yu-Ji; Luo, Chu-Ming; Tan, Bing; Wang, Ning; Zhu, Yan; Shi, Zheng-Li] Chinese Acad Sci, Wuhan Inst Virol, State Key Lab Virol, Ctr Emerging Infect Dis, Wuhan 430071, Peoples R China; [Chmura, Aleksei A.; Zhu, Guangjian; Epstein, Jonathan H.; Daszak, Peter] EcoHlth Alliance, New York, NY 10001 USA; [Mazet, Jonna K.] Univ Calif Davis, Sch Vet Med, Hlth Inst 1, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Crameri, Gary; Wang, Lin-Fa] CSIRO Australian Anim Hlth Lab, Geelong, Vic 3220, Australia; [Zhang, Shu-Yi] E China Normal Univ, Coll Life Sci, Shanghai 200062, Peoples R China; [Wang, Lin-Fa] Duke NUS Grad Med Sch, Emerging Infect Dis Program, Singapore 169857, Singapore","Daszak, P (reprint author), EcoHlth Alliance, New York, NY 10001 USA.",daszak@ecohealthalliance.org; zlshi@wh.iov.cn,"Crameri, Gary/H-8441-2013; Shi, Zhengli/A-1013-2013","Shi, Zhengli/0000-0001-8089-163X; Li, Jialu/0000-0001-9772-3886","State Key Program for Basic Research [2011CB504701, 2010CB530100]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [81290341, 31321001]; Scientific and technological basis special project [2013FY113500]; CSIRO OCE Science Leaders Award; National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) [R01AI079231]; National Institutes of Health (NIH)/National Science Foundation (NSF) 'Ecology and Evolution of Infectious Diseases' award from the NIH Fogarty International Center [R01TW005869]; NIH Fogarty International Center; Office of the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services [R56TW009502]; United States Agency for International Development (USAID) Emerging Pandemic Threats PREDICT","We acknowledge financial support from the State Key Program for Basic Research (2011CB504701 and 2010CB530100), National Natural Science Foundation of China (81290341 and 31321001), Scientific and technological basis special project (2013FY113500), CSIRO OCE Science Leaders Award, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) award number R01AI079231, a National Institutes of Health (NIH)/National Science Foundation (NSF) 'Ecology and Evolution of Infectious Diseases' award from the NIH Fogarty International Center (R01TW005869), an award from the NIH Fogarty International Center supported by International Influenza Funds from the Office of the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services (R56TW009502), and United States Agency for International Development (USAID) Emerging Pandemic Threats PREDICT.

Initiation on HCV-like IRESs relies on their specific interaction with the 40S subunit(2-8), which places the initiation codon into the P site, where it directly base-pairs with eIF2-bound initiator methionyl transfer RNA to form a 48S initiation complex. However, all HCV-like IRESs also specifically interact with eIF3 (refs 2, 5-7, 9-12), but the role of this interaction in IRES-mediated initiation has remained unknown. During canonical initiation, eIF3 binds to the 40S subunit as a component of the 43S pre-initiation complex, and comparison of the ribosomal positions of eIF3(13) and the HCV IRES8 revealed that they overlap, so that their rearrangement would be required for formation of ribosomal complexes containing both components(13). Here we present a cryo-electron microscopy reconstruction of a 40S ribosomal complex containing eIF3 and the CSFV IRES. Remarkably, although the position and interactions of the CSFV IRES with the 40S subunit in this complex are similar to those of the HCV IRES in the 40S-IRES binary complex(8), eIF3 is completely displaced from its ribosomal position in the 43S complex, and instead interacts through its ribosome-binding surface exclusively with the apical region of domain III of the IRES. Our results suggest a role for the specific interaction of HCV-like IRESs with eIF3 in preventing ribosomal association of eIF3, which could serve two purposes: relieving the competition between the IRES and eIF3 for a common binding site on the 40S subunit, and reducing formation of 43S complexes, thereby favouring translation of viral mRNAs.","[Hashem, Yaser; des Georges, Amedee; Frank, Joachim] Columbia Univ, Dept Biochem & Mol Biophys, Howard Hughes Med Inst, New York, NY 10032 USA; [Hashem, Yaser; des Georges, Amedee; Langlois, Robert; Liao, Hstau Y.; Grassucci, Robert A.; Frank, Joachim] Columbia Univ, Dept Biochem & Mol Biophys, New York, NY 10032 USA; [Dhote, Vidya; Pestova, Tatyana V.; Hellen, Christopher U.

Origins differ in number and structure across the three domains of life(1) and their properties determine the dynamics of chromosome replication. Bacteria and some archaea replicate from single origins, whereas most archaea and all eukaryotes replicate using multiple origins. Initiation mechanisms that rely on homologous recombination operate in some viruses. Here we show that such mechanisms also operate in archaea. We use deep sequencing to study replication in Haloferax volcanii and identify four chromosomal origins of differing activity. Deletion of individual origins results in perturbed replication dynamics and reduced growth. However, a strain lacking all origins has no apparent defects and grows significantly faster than wild type. Origin-less cells initiate replication at dispersed sites rather than at discrete origins and have an absolute requirement for the recombinase RadA, unlike strains lacking individual origins. Our results demonstrate that homologous recombination alone can efficiently initiate the replication of an entire cellular genome. This raises the question of what purpose replication origins serve and why they have evolved.","[Hawkins, Michelle; Nieduszynski, Conrad A.; Allers, Thorsten] Univ Nottingham, Queens Med Ctr, Sch Biol, Nottingham NG7 2UH, England; [Malla, Sunir; Blythe, Martin J.] Univ Nottingham, Queens Med Ctr, Deep Seq, Nottingham NG7 2UH, England","Allers, T (reprint author), Univ Nottingham, Queens Med Ctr, Sch Biol, Nottingham NG7 2UH, England.",conrad.nieduszynski@nottingham.ac.uk; thorsten.allers@nottingham.ac.uk,"Nieduszynski, Conrad/B-2170-2010","Nieduszynski, Conrad/0000-0003-2001-076X; Allers, Thorsten/0000-0002-7308-3332","Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC) [BB/E023754/1, BB/G001596/1]; Royal Society","This work was supported through the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC) (BB/E023754/1, BB/G001596/1).

Efforts to target this oncogene directly have faced difficulties owing to its picomolar affinity for GTP/GDP(4) and the absence of known allosteric regulatory sites. Oncogenic mutations result in functional activation of Ras family proteins by impairing GTP hydrolysis(5,6). With diminished regulation by GTPase activity, the nucleotide state of Ras becomes more dependent on relative nucleotide affinity and concentration. This gives GTP an advantage over GDP(7) and increases the proportion of active GTP-bound Ras. Here we report the development of small molecules that irreversibly bind to a common oncogenic mutant, K-Ras(G12C). These compounds rely on the mutant cysteine for binding and therefore do not affect the wild-type protein. Crystallographic studies reveal the formation of a new pocket that is not apparent in previous structures of Ras, beneath the effector binding switch-II region. Binding of these inhibitors to K-Ras(G12C) disrupts both switch-I and switch-II, subverting the native nucleotide preference to favour GDP over GTP and impairing binding to Raf. Our data provide structure-based validation of a new allosteric regulatory site on Ras that is targetable in a mutant-specific manner.","[Ostrem, Jonathan M.; Peters, Ulf; Sos, Martin L.; Shokat, Kevan M.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Dept Cellular & Mol Pharmacol, San Francisco, CA 94158 USA; [Wells, James A.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Pharmaceut Chem, San Francisco, CA 94158 USA; [Wells, James A.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Cellular & Mol Pharmacol, San Francisco, CA 94158 USA","Shokat, KM (reprint author), Univ Calif San Francisco, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Dept Cellular & Mol Pharmacol, San Francisco, CA 94158 USA.",kevan.shokat@ucsf.edu,"Wells, Jim/O-9854-2016","Peters, Ulf/0000-0003-4664-8198","postdoctoral fellowship of the Tobacco-related Disease Research Program [19FT-0069]; Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, of the US Department of Energy [DE-AC02-05CH11231]; Prostate Cancer Foundation (PCF)","We are grateful to M.

The crystal structure of EncM with bound substrate mimics and isotope labelling studies reveal previously unknown flavin redox biochemistry. We show that EncM maintains an unexpected stable flavin-oxygenating species, proposed to be a flavin-N5-oxide, to promote substrate oxidation and trigger a rare Favorskii-type rearrangement that is central to the biosynthesis of the antibiotic enterocin.

Global estimates of CO2 evasion have been hampered, however, by the lack of a framework for estimating the inland water surface area and gas transfer velocity and by the absence of a global CO2 database. Here we report regional variations in global inland water surface area, dissolved CO2 and gas transfer velocity. We obtain global CO2 evasion rates of 1.8(-0.25)(+0.25) petagrams of carbon (Pg C) per year from streams and rivers and 0.32(-0.26)(+0.52) Pg C yr(-1) from lakes and reservoirs, where the upper and lower limits are respectively the 5th and 95th confidence interval percentiles. The resulting global evasion rate of 2.1 Pg C yr(-1) is higher than previous estimates owing to a larger stream and river evasion rate. Our analysis predicts global hotspots in stream and river evasion, with about 70 per cent of the flux occurring over just 20 per cent of the land surface.

In zebrafish, ZGA is required for gastrulation and clearance of maternal messenger RNAs, which is in part regulated by the conserved microRNA miR-430. However, the factors that activate the zygotic program in vertebrates are unknown. Here we show that Nanog, Pou5f1 (also called Oct4) and SoxB1 regulate zygotic gene activation in zebrafish. We identified several hundred genes directly activated by maternal factors, constituting the first wave of zygotic transcription. Ribosome profiling revealed that nanog, sox19b and pou5f1 are the most highly translated transcription factors pre-MZT. Combined loss of these factors resulted in developmental arrest before gastrulation and a failure to activate >75% of zygotic genes, including miR-430. Our results demonstrate that maternal Nanog, Pou5f1 and SoxB1 are required to initiate the zygotic developmental program and induce clearance of the maternal program by activating miR-430 expression.","[Lee, Miler T.; Bonneau, Ashley R.; Takacs, Carter M.; Bazzini, Ariel A.; DiVito, Kate R.; Fleming, Elizabeth S.; Giraldez, Antonio J.] Yale Univ, Sch Med, Dept Genet, New Haven, CT 06510 USA; [Giraldez, Antonio J.] Yale Univ, Sch Med, Yale Stem Cell Ctr, New Haven, CT 06520 USA","Giraldez, AJ (reprint author), Yale Univ, Sch Med, Dept Genet, New Haven, CT 06510 USA.",antonio.giraldez@yale.edu,,,"NIH [F32HD071697-02, T32GM007499, F32HD061194-03]; Pew Fellows Program in Biomedical Sciences; Pew Scholars Program in the Biomedical Sciences; Yale Scholars Program;  [R01GM081602-06];  [R01GM103789-01];  [R01HD074078-02]","We thank Y.

Dormant persister cells that are tolerant to killing by antibiotics are responsible for this apparent paradox. Persisters are phenotypic variants of normal cells and pathways leading to dormancy are redundant, making it challenging to develop anti-persister compounds. Biofilms shield persisters from the immune system, suggesting that an antibiotic for treating a chronic infection should be able to eradicate the infection on its own. We reasoned that a compound capable of corrupting a target in dormant cells will kill persisters. The acyldepsipeptide antibiotic (ADEP4) has been shown to activate the ClpP protease, resulting in death of growing cells. Here we show that ADEP4-activated ClpP becomes a fairly nonspecific protease and kills persisters by degrading over 400 proteins, forcing cells to self-digest. Null mutants of clpP arise with high probability, but combining ADEP4 with rifampicin produced complete eradication of Staphylococcus aureus biofilms in vitro and in a mouse model of a chronic infection. Our findings indicate a general principle for killing dormant cells-activation and corruption of a target, rather than conventional inhibition. Eradication of a biofilm in an animal model by activating a protease suggests a realistic path towards developing therapies to treat chronic infections.","[Conlon, B. P.; Fleck, L. E.; Isabella, V.

Here we present data demonstrating that active transcription regulates levels of genomic methylation. We identify a novel RNA arising from the CEBPA gene locus that is critical in regulating the local DNA methylation profile. This RNA binds to DNMT1 and prevents CEBPA gene locus methylation. Deep sequencing of transcripts associated with DNMT1 combined with genome-scale methylation and expression profiling extend the generality of this finding to numerous gene loci. Collectively, these results delineate the nature of DNMT1-RNA interactions and suggest strategies for gene-selective demethylation of therapeutic targets in human diseases.","[Di Ruscio, Annalisa; Ebralidze, Alexander K.; Amabile, Giovanni; Pontes, Lorena Lobo De Figueiredo; Alberich-Jorda, Meritxell; Zhang, Pu; Rinn, John L.; Tenen, Daniel G.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Harvard Stem Cell Inst, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Di Ruscio, Annalisa; Ebralidze, Alexander K.; Amabile, Giovanni; Pontes, Lorena Lobo De Figueiredo; Alberich-Jorda, Meritxell; Ebralidze, Konstantin K.; Rinn, John L.] Beth Israel Deaconess Med Ctr, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [D'Alo, Francesco; Leone, Giuseppe] Univ Cattolica Sacro Cuore, Inst Hematol, I-00168 Rome, Italy; [Benoukraf, Touati; Wu, Mengchu; Tenen, Daniel G.] Natl Univ Singapore, Canc Sci Inst, Singapore 117599, Singapore; [Goff, Loyal A.; Rinn, John L.] Harvard Univ, Dept Stem Cell & Regenerat Biol, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Goff, Loyal A.; Rinn, John L.] Broad Inst MIT & Harvard, Cambridge Ctr 7, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; [Goff, Loyal A.] MIT, Comp Sci & Artificial Intelligence Lab, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Terragni, Jolyon; Pradhan, Sriharsa] New England Biolabs Inc, Ipswich, MA 01938 USA; [Figueroa, Maria Eugenia] Univ Michigan, Dept Pathol, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Alberich-Jorda, Meritxell] Acad Sci Czech Republic, Inst Mol Genet, CR-14220 Prague, Czech Republic; [Melnick, Ari] C620 Weill Cornell Med Coll, Dept Med, New York, NY 10021 USA","Tenen, DG (reprint author), Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Harvard Stem Cell Inst, Boston, MA 02115 USA.",daniel.tenen@nus.edu.sg,"Figueiredo-Pontes, Lorena/K-6520-2013; Alberich Jorda, Meritxell/G-3137-2014","Tenen, Daniel/0000-0002-6423-3888; Goff, Loyal/0000-0003-2875-451X; Leone, Giuseppe/0000-0002-7812-5300","National Institutes of Health (NIH) [CA118316, CA66996, HL56745, T32 HL007917-11A1]; Italian Foundation for Cancer Research (FIRC); Societa Italiana di Ematologia Sperimentale (SIES); FAMRI CIA [103063]; Fondazione Roma; American Italian Cancer Foundation Fellowship (AICF); Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP) [2011/11822-6]; National Research Foundation; Singapore Ministry of Education under its Centres of Excellence initiative; MSMT Navrat grant [LK21307]; New England Biolabs; Singapore Ministry of Health's National Medical Research Council under its Singapore Translational Research (STaR) Investigator Award; Associazione Italiana per la Ricerca sul Cancro","This work was supported by grants CA118316, CA66996 and HL56745 from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to D.G.T., the Italian Foundation for Cancer Research (FIRC) 'Leonino Fontana e Maria Lionello' fellowship, the NIH T32 HL007917-11A1 and the Societa Italiana di Ematologia Sperimentale (SIES) 'Dr. Tito Bastianello' fellowship to A.D.R.; FAMRI CIA (103063) grant to A.K.E.; Fondazione Roma 'Progetto cellule staminali' to G.L. and F.D'A.; the American Italian Cancer Foundation Fellowship (AICF) to G.A.; Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP)-grant no. 2011/11822-6-to L.L.D.F.P.; the National Research Foundation and the Singapore Ministry of Education under its Centres of Excellence initiative to M.W. and T.B.; the MSMT Navrat grant LK21307 to M.A.-J.

Because these studies were sensitive to the sizes of the planets but not their masses, the question remains whether these Earth-sized planets are indeed similar to the Earth in bulk composition. The smallest planets for which masses have been accurately determined(6,7) are Kepler-10b (1.42R(circle plus)) and Kepler-36b (1.49R(circle plus)), which are both significantly larger than the Earth.

Measuring the planet's mass-and hence its density, which is a clue to its composition-is more difficult. Planets of size 2-4R(circle plus) have proved to have a wide range of densities, implying a diversity of compositions(4,5), but these measurements did not extend to planets as small as Earth.

A drop striking a non-wetting surface of this type will spread out to a maximum diameter(11-14) and then recoil to such an extent that it completely rebounds and leaves the solid material(15-18). The amount of time that the drop is in contact with the solid-the 'contact time'-depends on the inertia and capillarity of the drop(1), internal dissipation(19) and surface-liquid interactions(20-22). And because contact time controls the extent to which mass, momentum and energy are exchanged between drop and surface(23), it is often advantageous to minimize it. The conventional approach has been to minimize surface-liquid interactions that can lead to contact line pinning(20-22); but even in the absence of any surface interactions, drop hydrodynamics imposes a minimum contact time that was conventionally assumed to be attained with axisymmetrically spreading and recoiling drops(21,24). Here we demonstrate that it is possible to reduce the contact time below this theoretical limit by using superhydrophobic surfaces with a morphology that redistributes the liquid mass and thereby alters the drop hydrodynamics. We show theoretically and experimentally that this approach allows us to reduce the overall contact time between a bouncing drop and a surface below what was previously thought possible.","[Bird, James C.] Boston Univ, Dept Mech Engn, Boston, MA 02155 USA; [Dhiman, Rajeev; Kwon, Hyuk-Min; Varanasi, Kripa K.] MIT, Dept Mech Engn, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA","Varanasi, KK (reprint author), MIT, Dept Mech Engn, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",varanasi@mit.edu,,,"DARPA; MIT Energy Initiative; NSF [0952564, DMS1004678]; MIT-Deshpande Center","K.K.V. was supported by a DARPA Young Faculty Award, the MIT Energy Initiative, an NSF Career Award (0952564) and the MIT-Deshpande Center.

The accumulation of beneficial cultural innovations across generations is puzzling because transmission events are generally imperfect, although there is large variance in fidelity. Events of perfect cultural transmission and innovations should be more frequent in a large population(4). As a consequence, a large population size may be a prerequisite for the evolution of cultural complexity(4,5), although anthropological studies have produced mixed results(6-9) and empirical evidence is lacking(10). Here we use a dual-task computer game to show that cultural evolution strongly depends on population size, as players in larger groups maintained higher cultural complexity. We found that when group size increases, cultural knowledge is less deteriorated, improvements to existing cultural traits are more frequent, and cultural trait diversity is maintained more often. Our results demonstrate how changes in group size can generate both adaptive cultural evolution and maladaptive losses of culturally acquired skills. As humans live in habitats for which they are ill-suited without specific cultural adaptations(11,12), it suggests that, in our evolutionary past, group-size reduction may have exposed human societies to significant risks, including societal collapse(13).","[Derex, Maxime; Beugin, Marie-Pauline; Godelle, Bernard; Raymond, Michel] Univ Montpellier 2, F-34095 Montpellier 5, France; [Raymond, Michel] CNRS, Inst Evolutionary Sci, Montpellier, France","Derex, M (reprint author), Univ Montpellier 2, Pl Eugene Bataillon, F-34095 Montpellier 5, France.",maxime.derex@gmail.com,"Raymond, Michel/C-9049-2015","Raymond, Michel/0000-0002-1714-6984",,,,28,72,72,3,70,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,21-Nov,2013,503,7476,,,,,389,+,,10.1038/nature12774,,9,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,254KG,WOS:000327163200039,24226775,No,,,11/20/17

Ageing results in the inability of these tissues to maintain homeostasis and it is believed that somatic stem-cell ageing is one underlying cause of tissue attrition with age or age-related diseases. Ageing of haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) is associated with impaired haematopoiesis in the elderly(3-6). Despite a large amount of data describing the decline of HSC function on ageing, the molecular mechanisms of this process remain largely unknown, which precludes rational approaches to attenuate stem-cell ageing. Here we report an unexpected shift from canonical to non-canonical Wnt signalling in mice due to elevated expression of Wnt5a in aged HSCs, which causes stem-cell ageing. Wnt5a treatment of young HSCs induces ageing-associated stem-cell apolarity, reduction of regenerative capacity and an ageing-like myeloid-lymphoid differentiation skewing via activation of the small Rho GTPase Cdc42. Conversely, Wnt5a haploinsufficiency attenuates HSC ageing, whereas stem-cell-intrinsic reduction of Wnt5a expression results in functionally rejuvenated aged HSCs. Our data demonstrate a critical role for stem-cell-intrinsic non-canonical Wnt5a signalling in HSC ageing.","[Florian, Maria Carolina; Doerr, Karin; Marka, Gina; Ueberle, Bettina; Vas, Virag; Scharffetter-Kochanek, Karin; Geiger, Hartmut] Univ Ulm, Dept Dermatol & Allerg Dis, D-89091 Ulm, Germany; [Nattamai, Kalpana J.; Zheng, Yi; Geiger, Hartmut] Cincinnati Childrens Hosp Med Ctr, Div Expt Hematol & Canc Biol, Cincinnati, OH 45229 USA; [Nattamai, Kalpana J.; Zheng, Yi; Geiger, Hartmut] Univ Cincinnati, Cincinnati, OH 45229 USA; [Eckl, Christina; Oostendorp, Robert A.

Although the pathogenesis of atopic dermatitis is not fully understood, the disease is mediated by an abnormal immunoglobulin E immune response in the setting of skin barrier dysfunction(2). Mast cells contribute to immunoglobulin-E-mediated allergic disorders including atopic dermatitis(3). Upon activation, mast cells release their membrane-bound cytosolic granules leading to the release of several molecules that are important in the pathogenesis of atopic dermatitis and host defence(4). More than 90% of patients with atopic dermatitis are colonized with Staphylococcus aureus in the lesional skin whereas most healthy individuals do not harbour the pathogen(5). Several staphylococcal exotoxins can act as superantigens and/or antigens in models of atopic dermatitis(6). However, the role of these staphylococcal exotoxins in disease pathogenesis remains unclear. Here we report that culture supernatants of S. aureus contain potent mast-cell degranulation activity. Biochemical analysis identified delta-toxin as the mast cell degranulation-inducing factor produced by S. aureus. Mast cell degranulation induced by delta-toxin depended on phosphoinositide 3-kinase and calcium (Ca2+) influx; however, unlike that mediated by immunoglobulin-E crosslinking, it did not require the spleen tyrosine kinase. In addition, immunoglobulin-E enhanced delta-toxin-induced mast cell degranulation in the absence of antigen. Furthermore, S. aureus isolates recovered from patients with atopic dermatitis produced large amounts of delta-toxin. Skin colonization with S. aureus, but not a mutant deficient in delta-toxin, promoted immunoglobulin-E and interleukin-4 production, as well as inflammatory skin disease. Furthermore, enhancement of immunoglobulin E production and dermatitis by delta-toxin was abrogated in Kit(W-sh/W-sh) mast-cell-deficient mice and restored by mast cell reconstitution. These studies identify delta-toxin as a potent inducer of mast cell degranulation and suggest a mechanistic link between S. aureus colonization and allergic skin disease.","[Nakamura, Yuumi; Chan, Susana M.; Munoz-Planillo, Raul; Hasegawa, Mizuho; Inohara, Naohiro; Nunez, Gabriel] Univ Michigan, Sch Med, Dept Pathol, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Nakamura, Yuumi; Chan, Susana M.; Munoz-Planillo, Raul; Hasegawa, Mizuho; Inohara, Naohiro; Nunez, Gabriel] Univ Michigan, Sch Med, Ctr Comprehens Canc, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Oscherwitz, Jon; Cease, Kemp B.] Univ Michigan, Sch Med, Dept Internal Med, Div Hematol Oncol, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Oscherwitz, Jon; Cease, Kemp B.] VA Ann Arbor Healthcare Syst, Ann Arbor, MI 48105 USA; [Villaruz, Amer E.; Cheung, Gordon Y.

We reasoned that if correctly orchestrated HIV-1 uncoating and nuclear entry is important for evasion of innate sensors then manipulation of specific interactions between HIV-1 capsid and host factors that putatively regulate these processes should trigger pattern recognition receptors and stimulate type 1 interferon (IFN) secretion. Here we show that HIV-1 capsid mutants N74D and P90A, which are impaired for interaction with cofactors cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor subunit 6 (CPSF6) and cyclophilins (Nup358 and CypA), respectively(1,2), cannot replicate in primary human monocyte-derived macrophages because they trigger innate sensors leading to nuclear translocation of NF-kappa B and IRF3, the production of soluble type 1 IFN and induction of an antiviral state. Depletion of CPSF6 with short hairpin RNA expression allows wild-type virus to trigger innate sensors and IFN production. In each case, suppressed replication is rescued by IFN-receptor blockade, demonstrating a role for IFN in restriction. IFN production is dependent on viral reverse transcription but not integration, indicating that a viral reverse transcription product comprises the HIV-1 pathogen-associated molecular pattern. Finally, we show that we can pharmacologically induce wild-type HIV-1 infection to stimulate IFN secretion and an antiviral state using a non-immunosuppressive cyclosporine analogue. We conclude that HIV-1 has evolved to use CPSF6 and cyclophilins to cloak its replication, allowing evasion of innate immune sensors and induction of a cell-autonomous innate immune response in primary human macrophages.","[Rasaiyaah, Jane; Tan, Choon Ping; Fletcher, Adam J.; Blondeau, Caroline; Hilditch, Laura; Noursadeghi, Mahdad; Towers, Greg J.] UCL, MRC, Ctr Med Mol Virol, Div Infect & Immun, London WC1E 6BT, England; [Price, Amanda J.; Jacques, David A.; James, Leo C.] MRC, Mol Biol Lab, Prot & Nucle Acid Chem Div, Cambridge CB2 0QH, England; [Selwood, David L.] UCL, Wolfson Inst Biomed Res, London WC1E 6BT, England","Towers, GJ (reprint author), UCL, MRC, Ctr Med Mol Virol, Div Infect & Immun, 90 Gower St, London WC1E 6BT, England.",m.noursadeghi@ucl.ac.uk; g.towers@ucl.ac.uk,"Blondeau, Caroline/D-4269-2017","Towers, Gregory/0000-0002-7707-0264; Jacques, David/0000-0002-6426-4510",Wellcome Trust [090940]; Medical Research Council; MRC Confidence in Concept Award; National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) University College London Hospitals Biomedical Research Centre,"We are grateful to J.

However, the outcome of interactions between an influenza haemagglutinin-specific B cell via its receptor (BCR) and virus is unclear. Through somatic cell nuclear transfer we generated mice that harbour B cells with a BCR specific for the haemagglutinin of influenza A/WSN/33 virus (FluBI mice). Their B cells secrete an immunoglobulin gamma 2b that neutralizes infectious virus. Whereas B cells from FluBI and control mice bind equivalent amounts of virus through interaction of haemagglutinin with surface-disposed sialic acids, the A/WSN/33 virus infects only the haemagglutinin-specific B cells. Mere binding of virus is not sufficient for infection of B cells: this requires interactions of the BCR with haemagglutinin, causing both disruption of antibody secretion and FluBI B-cell death within 18 h. In mice infected with A/WSN/33, lung-resident FluBI B cells are infected by the virus, thus delaying the onset of protective antibody release into the lungs, whereas FluBI cells in the draining lymph node are not infected and proliferate. We propose that influenza targets and kills influenza-specific B cells in the lung, thus allowing the virus to gain purchase before the initiation of an effective adaptive response.","[Dougan, Stephanie K.; Ashour, Joseph; Karssemeijer, Roos A.; Popp, Maximilian W.; Avalos, Ana M.; Barisa, Marta; Altenburg, Arwen F.; Ingram, Jessica R.; Cragnolini, Juan Jose; Jaenisch, Rudolf; Ploegh, Hidde L.] Whitehead Inst Biomed Res, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; [Popp, Maximilian W.; Ploegh, Hidde L.] MIT, Dept Biol, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Guo, Chunguang; Alt, Frederick W.] Boston Childrens Hosp, Boston, MA 02115 USA","Ploegh, HL (reprint author), Whitehead Inst Biomed Res, 9 Cambridge Ctr, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA.",ploegh@wi.mit.edu,,"Barisa, Marta/0000-0001-7846-6810",Cancer Research Institute; Human Frontiers Science Program; National Institutes of Health; American Association for Cancer Research-Pancreatic Cancer Action Network,"S.K.D. and C.G. were funded by the Cancer Research Institute.

In addition, homeostatic pathways allow organisms to protect their core temperatures in response to cold exposure(2). However, the mechanism responsible for coordinating daily body temperature rhythm and adaptability to environmental challenges is unknown. Here we show that the nuclear receptor Rev-erb alpha (also known as Nr1d1), a powerful transcriptional repressor, links circadian and thermogenic networks through the regulation of brown adipose tissue (BAT) function. Mice exposed to cold fare considerably better at 05:00 (Zeitgeber time 22) when Rev-erb alpha is barely expressed than at 17:00 (Zeitgeber time 10) when Rev-erb alpha is abundant. Deletion of Rev-erb alpha markedly improves cold tolerance at 17: 00, indicating that overcoming Rev-erb alpha-dependent repression is a fundamental feature of the thermogenic response to cold. Physiological induction of uncoupling protein 1 (Ucp1) by cold temperatures is preceded by rapid downregulation of Rev-erb alpha in BAT. Rev-erb alpha represses Ucp1 in a brown-adipose-cell-autonomous manner and BAT Ucp1 levels are high in Rev-erb alpha-null mice, even at thermoneutrality. Genetic loss of Rev-erb alpha also abolishes normal rhythms of body temperature and BAT activity. Thus, Rev-erb alpha acts as a thermogenic focal point required for establishing and maintaining body temperature rhythm in a manner that is adaptable to environmental demands.","[Gerhart-Hines, Zachary; Feng, Dan; Emmett, Matthew J.; Everett, Logan J.; Briggs, Erika R.; Bugge, Anne; Lazar, Mitchell A.] Univ Penn, Perelman Sch Med, Div Endocrinol Diabet & Metab, Dept Med,Dept Genet, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Gerhart-Hines, Zachary; Feng, Dan; Emmett, Matthew J.; Everett, Logan J.; Briggs, Erika R.; Bugge, Anne; Seale, Patrick; Lazar, Mitchell A.] Univ Penn, Perelman Sch Med, Inst Diabet Obes & Metab, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Loro, Emanuele; Khurana, Tejvir S.] Univ Penn, Perelman Sch Med, Dept Physiol, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Loro, Emanuele; Khurana, Tejvir S.] Univ Penn, Perelman Sch Med, Penn Muscle Inst, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Hou, Catherine; Pryma, Daniel A.] Univ Penn, Perelman Sch Med, Dept Radiol, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Ferrara, Christine] Childrens Hosp Philadelphia, Dept Pediat, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Seale, Patrick] Univ Penn, Perelman Sch Med, Dept Cell & Dev Biol, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA","Lazar, MA (reprint author), Univ Penn, Perelman Sch Med, Div Endocrinol Diabet & Metab, Dept Med,Dept Genet, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",lazar@mail.med.upenn.edu,,,"NIH [R01 DK45586, F-32 DK095563]; JPB Foundation; Novo Nordisk STAR postdoctoral program","We thank the Functional Genomics Core (J.

It is therefore not surprising that intricate genetic networks have evolved to perceive and integrate both endogenous and environmental signals, such as carbohydrate and hormonal status, photoperiod and temperature(1,2). In contrast to our detailed understanding of the vernalization pathway, little is known about how flowering time is controlled in response to changes in the ambient growth temperature. In Arabidopsis thaliana, the MADS-box transcription factor genes FLOWERING LOCUS M (FLM) and SHORT VEGETATIVE PHASE (SVP) have key roles in this process(3,4). FLM is subject to temperature-dependent alternative splicing(3). Here we report that the two main FLM protein splice variants, FLM-beta and FLM-delta, compete for interaction with the floral repressor SVP. The SVP-FLM-beta complex is predominately formed at low temperatures and prevents precocious flowering. By contrast, the competing SVP-FLM-delta complex is impaired in DNA binding and acts as a dominant-negative activator of flowering at higher temperatures.

The notion that enzymes selectively stabilize the rate-limiting transition state of the catalysed reaction relative to the bound ground state reduces the problem of design to one of molecular recognition. Nevertheless, past attempts to capitalize on this idea, for example by using transition state analogues to elicit antibodies with catalytic activities(2), have generally failed to deliver true enzymatic rates. The advent of computational design approaches, combined with directed evolution, has provided an opportunity to revisit this problem. Starting from a computationally designed catalyst for the Kemp elimination(3)-a well-studied model system for proton transfer from carbon-we show that an artificial enzyme can be evolved that accelerates an elementary chemical reaction 6 x 10(8)-fold, approaching the exceptional efficiency of highly optimized natural enzymes such as triosephosphate isomerase. A 1.09 angstrom resolution crystal structure of the evolved enzyme indicates that familiar catalytic strategies such as shape complementarity and precisely placed catalytic groups can be successfully harnessed to afford such high rate accelerations, making us optimistic about the prospects of designing more sophisticated catalysts.","[Blomberg, Rebecca; Kries, Hajo; Pinkas, Daniel M.; Hilvert, Donald] ETH, Organ Chem Lab, CH-8093 Zurich, Switzerland; [Mittl, Peer R.

They are synthesized by HOIP, which belongs to the RBR (RING-between-RING) family of E3 ligases and is the catalytic component of LUBAC (linear ubiquitin chain assembly complex), a multisubunit E3 ligase(6). RBR family members act as RING/HECT hybrids, employing RING1 to recognize ubiquitin-loaded E2 while a conserved cysteine in RING2 subsequently forms a thioester intermediate with the transferred or 'donor' ubiquitin(7). Here we report the crystal structure of the catalytic core of HOIP in its apo form and in complex with ubiquitin. The carboxy-terminal portion of HOIP adopts a novel fold that, together with a zinc-finger, forms a ubiquitin-binding platform that orients the acceptor ubiquitin and positions its alpha-amino group for nucleophilic attack on the E3 similar to ubiquitin thioester. The C-terminal tail of a second ubiquitin molecule is located in close proximity to the catalytic cysteine, providing a unique snapshot of the ubiquitin transfer complex containing both donor and acceptor ubiquitin. These interactions are required for activation of the NF-kappa B pathway in vivo, and they explain the determinants of linear ubiquitin chain specificity by LUBAC.","[Stieglitz, Benjamin; Rana, Rohini R.; Koliopoulos, Marios G.; Morris-Davies, Aylin C.; Christodoulou, Evangelos; Howell, Steven; Brown, Nicholas R.; Rittinger, Katrin] Natl Inst Med Res, MRC, Div Mol Struct, London NW7 1AA, England; [Schaeffer, Veronique; Dikic, Ivan] Goethe Univ Frankfurt, Sch Med, Inst Biochem 2, D-60590 Frankfurt, Main, Germany","Rittinger, K (reprint author), Natl Inst Med Res, MRC, Div Mol Struct, London NW7 1AA, England.",katrin.rittinger@nimr.mrc.ac.uk,"Dikic, Ivan/O-4650-2015; Rittinger, Katrin/D-2586-2014","Dikic, Ivan/0000-0001-8156-9511; Stieglitz, Benjamin/0000-0003-3634-6997; Rittinger, Katrin/0000-0002-7698-4435",Medical Research Council [U117565398]; Wellcome Foundation [094112/Z/10/Z]; European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union; ERC [250241-LineUb],"We thank S.

In vertebrates, differentiated cells are known to revert into replicating progenitors, but these cells do not persist as stable stem cells. Here we present evidence that differentiated airway epithelial cells can revert into stable and functional stem cells in vivo. After the ablation of airway stem cells, we observed a surprising increase in the proliferation of committed secretory cells. Subsequent lineage tracing demonstrated that the luminal secretory cells had dedifferentiated into basal stem cells. Dedifferentiated cells were morphologically indistinguishable from stem cells and they functioned as well as their endogenous counterparts in repairing epithelial injury. Single secretory cells clonally dedifferentiated into multipotent stem cells when they were cultured ex vivo without basal stem cells. By contrast, direct contact with a single basal stem cell was sufficient to prevent secretory cell dedifferentiation. In analogy to classical descriptions of amphibian nuclear reprogramming, the propensity of committed cells to dedifferentiate is inversely correlated to their state of maturity. This capacity of committed cells to dedifferentiate into stem cells may have a more general role in the regeneration of many tissues and in multiple disease states, notably cancer.","[Tata, Purushothama Rao; Mou, Hongmei; Pardo-Saganta, Ana; Zhao, Rui; Prabhu, Mythili; Law, Brandon M.; Vinarsky, Vladimir; Sahay, Amar; Rajagopal, Jayaraj] Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Ctr Regenerat Med, Boston, MA 02114 USA; [Tata, Purushothama Rao; Mou, Hongmei; Pardo-Saganta, Ana; Zhao, Rui; Prabhu, Mythili; Law, Brandon M.; Vinarsky, Vladimir; Rajagopal, Jayaraj] Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Dept Pediat, Boston, MA 02114 USA; [Tata, Purushothama Rao; Mou, Hongmei; Pardo-Saganta, Ana; Zhao, Rui; Prabhu, Mythili; Law, Brandon M.; Vinarsky, Vladimir; Cho, Josalyn L.; Medoff, Benjamin D.; Rajagopal, Jayaraj] Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Dept Internal Med, Pulm & Crit Care Unit, Boston, MA 02114 USA; [Tata, Purushothama Rao; Mou, Hongmei; Pardo-Saganta, Ana; Zhao, Rui; Prabhu, Mythili; Law, Brandon M.; Vinarsky, Vladimir; Sahay, Amar; Rajagopal, Jayaraj] Harvard Stem Cell Inst, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Cho, Josalyn L.; Medoff, Benjamin D.] Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Ctr Immunol & Inflammatory Dis, Charlestown, MA 02129 USA; [Breton, Sylvie] Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Ctr Syst Biol, Program Membrane Biol, Boston, MA 02214 USA; [Breton, Sylvie] Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Div Nephrol, Boston, MA 02214 USA; [Breton, Sylvie] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Boston, MA 02214 USA; [Sahay, Amar] Harvard Univ, Dept Psychiat, Sch Med, Boston, MA 02215 USA","Rajagopal, J (reprint author), Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Ctr Regenerat Med, 185 Cambridge St, Boston, MA 02114 USA.",jrajagopal@partners.org,"Zhao, Rui/J-7110-2014",,"Harvard Stem Cell Institute Seed Grant; National Institutes of Health-National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute Early Career Research New Faculty [5P30HL101287-02]; Harvard Stem Cell Institute (HSCI) Junior Investigator Grant","The work in this manuscript was supported by a Harvard Stem Cell Institute Seed Grant and a National Institutes of Health-National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute Early Career Research New Faculty (P30) award (5P30HL101287-02) and a Harvard Stem Cell Institute (HSCI) Junior Investigator Grant to J.R.

In humanized mice, combinations of monoclonal antibodies have been shown to suppress viraemia, but the therapeutic potential of these monoclonal antibodies has not yet been evaluated in primates with an intact immune system. Here we show that administration of a cocktail of HIV-1-specific monoclonal antibodies, as well as the single glycan-dependent monoclonal antibody PGT121, resulted in a rapid and precipitous decline of plasma viraemia to undetectable levels in rhesus monkeys chronically infected with the pathogenic simian-human immunodeficiency virus SHIV-SF162P3. A single monoclonal antibody infusion afforded up to a 3.1 log decline of plasma viral RNA in 7 days and also reduced proviral DNA in peripheral blood, gastrointestinal mucosa and lymph nodes without the development of viral resistance. Moreover, after monoclonal antibody administration, host Gag-specific T-lymphocyte responses showed improved functionality. Virus rebounded in most animals after a median of 56 days when serum monoclonal antibody titres had declined to undetectable levels, although, notably, a subset of animals maintained long-term virological control in the absence of further monoclonal antibody infusions. These data demonstrate a profound therapeutic effect of potent neutralizing HIV-1-specific monoclonal antibodies in SHIV-infected rhesus monkeys as well as an impact on host immune responses. Our findings strongly encourage the investigation of monoclonal antibody therapy for HIV-1 in humans.","[Barouch, Dan H.; Whitney, James B.; Liu, Jinyan; Stephenson, Kathryn E.; Chang, Hui-Wen; Nkolola, Joseph P.; Seaman, Michael S.; Smith, Kaitlin M.; Borducchi, Erica N.; Cabral, Crystal; Smith, Jeffrey Y.; Blackmore, Stephen; Sanisetty, Srisowmya; Perry, James R.] Harvard Univ, Beth Israel Deaconess Med Ctr, Sch Med, Ctr Virol & Vaccine Res, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Barouch, Dan H.; Chakraborty, Arup K.; Burton, Dennis R.] Ragon Inst MGH MIT & Harvard, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Moldt, Brian; Poignard, Pascal; Burton, Dennis R.] Scripps Res Inst, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; [Klein, Florian; Oliveira, Thiago Y.; Nussenzweig, Michel C.] Rockefeller Univ, New York, NY 10065 USA; [Shekhar, Karthik; Gupta, Sanjana; Chakraborty, Arup K.] MIT, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Beck, Matthew] New England Primate Res Ctr, Southborough, MA 01776 USA; [Lewis, Mark G.] Bioqual Inc, Rockville, MD 20852 USA; [Rinaldi, William] Alpha Genesis Inc, Yemassee, SC 29945 USA; [Nussenzweig, Michel C.] Howard Hughes Med Inst, New York, NY 10065 USA","Barouch, DH (reprint author), Harvard Univ, Beth Israel Deaconess Med Ctr, Sch Med, Ctr Virol & Vaccine Res, Boston, MA 02215 USA.",dbarouch@bidmc.harvard.edu,"poignard, pascal/N-6678-2013; Chang, Hui-Wen/C-9058-2017","Chang, Hui-Wen/0000-0001-8877-1886; Oliveira, Thiago/0000-0002-2654-0879","National Institutes of Health [AI055332, AI060354, AI078526, AI084794, AI095985, AI096040, AI10063, AI100148, AI100663]; Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation [OPP1033091, OPP1033115, OPP1040741, OPP1040753]; Ragon Institute of MGH, MIT, and Harvard; Lundbeck Foundation; Stavros Niarchos Foundation","We thank A.

Over thirty years ago, after the discovery of self-splicing group II intron RNAs, the snRNAs were proposed to catalyse splicing. However, no definitive evidence for a role of either RNA or protein in catalysis by the spliceosome has been reported so far. By using metal rescue strategies in spliceosomes from budding yeast, here we show that the U6 snRNA catalyses both of the two splicing reactions by positioning divalent metals that stabilize the leaving groups during each reaction. Notably, all of the U6 catalytic metal ligands we identified correspond to the ligands observed to position catalytic, divalent metals in crystal structures of a group II intron RNA. These findings indicate that group II introns and the spliceosome share common catalytic mechanisms and probably common evolutionary origins.

Above the threshold size of impactor at which the atmosphere absorbs sufficient energy to prevent a ground impact, most of the damage is thought to be caused by the airburst shock wave(3), but owing to lack of observations this is uncertain(4,5). Here we report an analysis of the damage from the airburst of an asteroid about 19 metres (17 to 20 metres) in diameter southeast of Chelyabinsk, Russia, on 15 February 2013, estimated to have an energy equivalent of approximately 500 (+/- 100) kilotons of trinitrotoluene (TNT, where 1 kiloton of TNT = 4.185x10(12) joules). We show that a widely referenced technique(4-6) of estimating airburst damage does not reproduce the observations, and that the mathematical relations(7) based on the effects of nuclear weapons-almost always used with this technique-overestimate blast damage. This suggests that earlier damage estimates(5,6) near the threshold impactor size are too high. We performed a global survey of airbursts of a kiloton or more (including Chelyabinsk), and find that the number of impactors with diameters of tens of metres may be an order of magnitude higher than estimates based on other techniques(8,9). This suggests a non-equilibrium(if the population were in a long-term collisional steady state the size-frequency distribution would either follow a single power law or there must be a size-dependent bias in other surveys) in the near-Earth asteroid population for objects 10 to 50 metres in diameter, and shifts more of the residual impact risk to these sizes.","[Brown, P.

A fundamental problem resulting from their quantum mechanical nature is that the localized magnetic moments of these atoms are easily destabilized by interactions with electrons, nuclear spins and lattice vibrations of the substrate(3-5). Even when large magnetic fields are applied to stabilize the magnetic moment, the observed lifetimes remain rather short(5,6) (less than a microsecond). Several routes for stabilizing the magnetic moment against fluctuations have been suggested, such as using thin insulating layers between the magnetic atom and the substrate to suppress the interactions with the substrate's conduction electrons(2,3,5), or coupling several magnetic moments together to reduce their quantum mechanical fluctuations(7,8). Here we show that the magnetic moments of single holmium atoms on a highly conductive metallic substrate can reach lifetimes of the order of minutes. The necessary decoupling from the thermal bath of electrons, nuclear spins and lattice vibrations is achieved by a remarkable combination of several symmetries intrinsic to the system: time reversal symmetry, the internal symmetries of the total angular momentum and the point symmetry of the local environment of the magnetic atom.","[Miyamachi, Toshio; Schuh, Tobias; Maerkl, Tobias; Bresch, Christopher; Balashov, Timofey; Stoehr, Alexander; Wulfhekel, Wulf] Karlsruhe Inst Technol KIT, Inst Phys, D-76131 Karlsruhe, Germany; [Miyamachi, Toshio] Univ Tokyo, Inst Solid State Phys, Kashiwa, Chiba 2778581, Japan; [Stoehr, Alexander] Max Planck Inst Festkorperforsch, D-70569 Stuttgart, Germany; [Karlewski, Christian; Andre, Stephan; Marthaler, Michael; Schoen, Gerd] Karlsruhe Inst Technol KIT, Inst Theoret Festkorperphys, D-76131 Karlsruhe, Germany; [Hoffmann, Martin; Geilhufe, Matthias; Ostanin, Sergey; Mertig, Ingrid; Ernst, Arthur] Max Planck Inst Mikrostrukturphys, D-06120 Halle, Germany; [Hoffmann, Martin; Hergert, Wolfram; Mertig, Ingrid] Univ Halle Wittenberg, Inst Phys, D-06099 Halle, Germany; [Ernst, Arthur] Univ Leipzig, Wilhelm Ostwald Inst Phys & Theoret Chem, D-04103 Leipzig, Germany","Wulfhekel, W (reprint author), Karlsruhe Inst Technol KIT, Inst Phys, Wolfgang Gaede Str 1, D-76131 Karlsruhe, Germany.",wulf.wulfhekel@kit.edu,"Marthaler, Michael/J-3295-2013; Schon, Gerd/A-3582-2008; Hoffmann, Martin/G-4675-2016","Hoffmann, Martin/0000-0002-8426-725X; Maerkl, Tobias/0000-0002-4206-5086; Balashov, Timofey/0000-0003-0966-7920","German Science Foundation (DFG) [Wu349/4-2, SPP 1538]; DFG Collaborative Research Centre [SFB 762]","We acknowledge funding by the German Science Foundation (DFG) grant number Wu349/4-2, the DFG priority programme SPP 1538 Spin Caloric Transport and the DFG Collaborative Research Centre SFB 762 Functionality of Oxide Interfaces.

Natural processes have achieved the orchestration of multicomponent systems across many length scales with very high precision(3,4), but man-made self-assemblies still face obstacles in realizing well-defined hierarchical structures(5-11). In particle-based self-assembly, the challenge is to program symmetries and periodicities of superstructures by providing monodisperse building blocks with suitable shape anisotropy or anisotropic interaction patterns ('patches'). Irregularities in particle architecture are intolerable because they generate defects that amplify throughout the hierarchical levels. For patchy microscopic hard colloids, this challenge has been approached by using top-down methods (such as metal shading or microcontact printing), enabling molecule-like directionality during aggregation(12-16). However, both top-down procedures and particulate systems based on molecular assembly struggle to fabricate patchy particles controllably in the desired size regime (10-100 nm). Here we introduce the co-assembly of dynamic patchy nanoparticles-that is, soft patchy nanoparticles that are intrinsically self-assembled and monodisperse-as a modular approach for producing well-ordered binary and ternary supracolloidal hierarchical assemblies. We bridge up to three hierarchical levels by guiding triblock terpolymers (length scale 10 nm) to form soft patchy nanoparticles (20-50 nm) of different symmetries that, in combination, co-assemble into substructured, compartmentalized materials (>10 mu m) with predictable and tunable nanoscale periodicities. We establish how molecular control over polymer composition programs the building block symmetries and regulates particle positioning, offering a route to well-ordered mixed mesostructures of high complexity.","[Groeschel, Andre H.; Loebling, Tina I.; Schmalz, Holger; Mueller, Axel H.

Suggestions for the origin of increased salinity in the crater have included evaporite dissolution(6), osmosis(6) and evaporation from heating(7) associated with the bolide impact. Here we present chemical, isotopic and physical evidence that together indicate that groundwater in the Chesapeake crater is remnant Early Cretaceous North Atlantic (ECNA) sea water. We find that the sea water is probably 100-145 million years old and that it has an average salinity of about 70 per mil, which is twice that of modern sea water and consistent with the nearly closed ECNA basin(8). Previous evidence for temperature and salinity levels of ancient oceans have been estimated indirectly from geochemical, isotopic and palaeontological analyses of solid materials in deep sediment cores. In contrast, our study identifies ancient sea water in situ and provides a direct estimate of its age and salinity. Moreover, we suggest that it is likely that remnants of ECNA sea water persist in deep sediments at many locations along the Atlantic margin.","[Sanford, Ward E.; Doughten, Michael W.; Coplen, Tyler B.] US Geol Survey, Reston, VA 20192 USA; [Hunt, Andrew G.] US Geol Survey, Fed Ctr, Denver, CO 80225 USA; [Bullen, Thomas D.] US Geol Survey, Menlo Pk, CA 94025 USA","Sanford, WE (reprint author), US Geol Survey, Mail Stop 431, Reston, VA 20192 USA.",wsanford@usgs.gov,,,,,,39,7,8,2,43,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,14-Nov,2013,503,7475,,,,,252,+,,10.1038/nature12714,,13,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,250YX,WOS:000326894200049,24226889,No,,,11/20/17

The palaeoeco-logical circumstances that favoured their emergence and success remain an intriguing question(3-6). Recent molecular phylogenetic analyses have suggested a wide range of dates for the initial appearance of the Holometabola, from the Middle Devonian epoch (391 million years (Myr) ago) to the Late Pennsylvanian epoch (311 Myr ago(7-12)), and Hemiptera (310 Myr ago(13)). Palaeoenvironments greatly changed over these periods, with global cooling and increasing complexity of green forests(14). The Pennsylvanian-period crown-eumetabolan fossil record remains notably incomplete(15-1)9, particularly as several fossils have been erroneously considered to be stemHolometabola(1,15,20,21) (Supplementary Information); the earliest definitive beetles are from the start of the Permian period(21,22). The emergence of the hymenopterids, sister group to other Holometabola, is dated between 350 and 309 Myr ago(8,9,12), incongruent with their current earliest record(Middle Triassic epoch)(1,20). Here we describe five fossils-aGzhelian-age stem coleopterid, a holometabolous larva of uncertain ordinal affinity, a stem hymenopterid, and early Hemiptera and Psocodea, all from the Moscovian age-and reveal a notable penecontemporaneous breadth of early eumetabolan insects. These discoveries are more congruent with current hypotheses of clade divergence. Eumetabola experienced episodes of diversification during the Bashkirian-Moscovian and the Kasimovian-Gzhelian ages. This cladogenetic activity is perhaps related to notable episodes of drying resulting from glaciations, leading to the eventual demise in Euramerica of coal-swamp ecosystems, evidenced by floral turnover during this interval(23,24). These ancient species were of very small size, living in the shadow of Palaeozoic-era 'giant' insects. Although these discoveries reveal unexpected Pennsylvanian eumetabolan diversity, the lineage radiated more successfully only after the mass extinctions at the end of the Permian period, giving rise to the familiar crown groups of their respective clades.","[Nel, Andre; Roques, Patrick; Nel, Patricia; Bourgoin, Thierry; Azar, Dany; Desutter-Grandcolas, Laure; Garrouste, Romain; Coty, David; Kirejtshuk, Alexander G.] Museum Natl Hist Nat, CNRS, UMR 7205, F-75231 Paris, France; [Nel, Patricia] AgroParisTech, Dept Sci Vie & Sante, F-75231 Paris 05, France; [Prokin, Alexander A.] Russian Acad Sci, Papanin Inst Biol Inland Waters, Borok 152742, Yaroslavl Oblas, Russia; [Prokop, Jakub] Charles Univ Prague, Fac Sci, Dept Zool, CZ-12844 Prague 2, Czech Republic; [Szwedo, Jacek] Polish Acad Sci, Museum & Inst Zool, Dept Palaeozool, PL-00679 Warsaw, Poland; [Azar, Dany] Lebanese Univ, Fac Sci 2, Dept Nat Sci, Fanar, Fanar Matn, Lebanon; [Wappler, Torsten] Univ Bonn, Steinmann Inst Geol Mineral & Palaontol, D-53115 Bonn, Germany; [Huang, Diying] Chinese Acad Sci, Nanjing Inst Geol & Palaeontol, State Key Lab Palaeobiol & Stratig, Nanjing 210008, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Engel, Michael S.] Univ Kansas, Div Entomol, Nat Hist Museum, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA; [Engel, Michael S.] Univ Kansas, Dept Ecol Evolutionary Biol, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA; [Kirejtshuk, Alexander G.] Russian Acad Sci, Zool Inst, St Petersburg, Russia","Nel, A (reprint author), Museum Natl Hist Nat, CNRS, UMR 7205, CP 50,45 Rue Buffon, F-75231 Paris, France.",anel@mnhn.fr,"Prokop, Jakub/B-1432-2008; Wappler, Torsten/D-4287-2011; Engel, Michael/C-5461-2012; Prokin, Alexander/Q-6136-2016; Szwedo, Jacek/B-4774-2013","Prokop, Jakub/0000-0001-6996-7832; Wappler, Torsten/0000-0003-1592-0988; Engel, Michael/0000-0003-3067-077X; Prokin, Alexander/0000-0002-9345-5607; Szwedo, Jacek/0000-0002-2796-9538; Bourgoin, Thierry/0000-0001-9277-2478",Grant Agency of the Czech Republic [P210/10/0633]; German Science Foundation [WA 1492/6-1]; Russian Foundation of Basic Research [12-04-00663-a],"We thank C.

In Drosophila melanogaster, behavioural genetics studies have identified a higher brain structure called the central complex as being required for the fly's innate responses to vertical visual features(1) and its short-and long-term memory for visual patterns(2-4). But whether and how neurons of the fly central complex represent visual features are unknown. Here we use two-photon calcium imaging in head-fixed walking and flying flies to probe visuomotor responses of ring neurons-a class of central complex neurons that have been implicated in landmark-driven spatial memory in walking flies(2,3) and memory for visual patterns in tethered flying flies(5). We show that dendrites of ring neurons are visually responsive and arranged retinotopically. Ring neuron receptive fields comprise both excitatory and inhibitory subfields, resembling those of simple cells in the mammalian primary visual cortex. Ring neurons show strong and, in some cases, direction-selective orientation tuning, with a notable preference for vertically oriented features similar to those that evoke innate responses in flies(1,2). Visual responses were diminished during flight, but, in contrast with the hypothesized role of the central complex in the control of locomotion(6), not modulated during walking. Taken together, these results indicate that ring neurons represent behaviourally relevant visual features in the fly's environment, enabling downstream central complex circuits to produce appropriate motor commands(6). More broadly, this study opens the door to mechanistic investigations of circuit computations underlying visually guided action selection in the Drosophila central complex.","[Seelig, Johannes D.; Jayaraman, Vivek] Howard Hughes Med Inst, Ashburn, VA 20147 USA","Jayaraman, V (reprint author), Howard Hughes Med Inst, Janelia Farm Res Campus,19700 Helix Dr, Ashburn, VA 20147 USA.",vivek@janelia.hhmi.org,,,Howard Hughes Medical Institute,"We thank A.

PMDS is caused by heterozygous deletions of chromosome 22q13.3. Among the genes in the deleted region is SHANK3, which encodes a protein in the postsynaptic density (PSD)(2,3). Rare mutations in SHANK3 have been associated with idiopathic ASDs(4-7), non-syndromic intellectual disability(8), and schizophrenia(9). Although SHANK3 is considered to be the most likely candidate gene for the neurological abnormalities in PMDS patients(10), the cellular and molecular phenotypes associated with this syndrome in human neurons are unknown. We generated induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells from individuals with PMDS and autism and used them to produce functional neurons. We show that PMDS neurons have reduced SHANK3 expression and major defects in excitatory, but not inhibitory, synaptic transmission. Excitatory synaptic transmission in PMDS neurons can be corrected by restoring SHANK3 expression or by treating neurons with insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1). IGF1 treatment promotes formation of mature excitatory synapses that lack SHANK3 but contain PSD95 and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors with fast deactivation kinetics. Our findings provide direct evidence for a disruption in the ratio of cellular excitation and inhibition in PMDS neurons, and point to a molecular pathway that can be recruited to restore it.","[Shcheglovitov, Aleksandr; Shcheglovitova, Olesya; Yazawa, Masayuki; Portmann, Thomas; Shu, Rui; Krawisz, Anna] Stanford Univ, Dept Neurobiol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Sebastiano, Vittorio] Stanford Univ, Dept Obstet & Gynecol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Sebastiano, Vittorio] Stanford Univ, Inst Stem Cell Biol & Regenerat Med, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Froehlich, Wendy; Bernstein, Jonathan A.] Stanford Univ, Dept Pediat, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Froehlich, Wendy; Hallmayer, Joachim F.] Stanford Univ, Dept Psychiat & Behav Sci, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Dolmetsch, Ricardo E.] Novartis Inst Biomed Res, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA","Dolmetsch, RE (reprint author), Novartis Inst Biomed Res, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",Ricardo.dolmetsch@novartis.com,,,National Institutes of Health (NIH) [NS069375]; California Institute for Regenerative Medicine CIRM; Autism Science Foundation; Phelan-McDermid Syndrome Foundation; Swiss National Science Foundation; Japan Society for the Promotion of Research Abroad; American Heart Association; National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [R33MH087898]; NIH [5DP1OD3889]; CIRM [RT2-01906]; Simons Foundation; JDH; Flora foundation,"We are grateful to participants and their families for their support; M.

Homozygosity for the highly prevalent ATG16L1 risk allele, or murine hypomorphic (HM) activity, causes Paneth cell dysfunction(2,3). As Atg16l1(HM) mice do not develop spontaneous intestinal inflammation, the mechanism(s) by which ATG16L1 contributes to disease remains obscure. Deletion of the unfolded protein response (UPR) transcription factor X-box binding protein-1 (Xbp1) in intestinal epithelial cells, the human orthologue of which harbours rare inflammatory bowel disease risk variants, results in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, Paneth cell impairment and spontaneous enteritis4. Unresolved ER stress is a common feature of inflammatory bowel disease epithelium(4,5), and several genetic risk factors of Crohn's disease affect Paneth cells(2,4,6-9). Here we show that impairment in either UPR (Xbp1(Delta IEC)) or autophagy function (Atg16l1(Delta IEC) or Atg7(Delta IEC)) in intestinal epithelial cells results in each other's compensatory engagement, and severe spontaneous Crohn's-disease-like transmural ileitis if both mechanisms are compromised. Xbp1DIEC mice show autophagosome formation in hypomorphic Paneth cells, which is linked to ER stress via protein kinase RNA-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK), elongation initiation factor 2 alpha (eIF2 alpha) and activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4). Ileitis is dependent on commensal microbiota and derives from increased intestinal epithelial cell death, inositol requiring enzyme 1 alpha (IRE1 alpha)-regulated NF-kappa B activation and tumour-necrosis factor signalling, which are synergistically increased when autophagy is deficient. ATG16L1 restrains IRE1a activity, and augmentation of autophagy in intestinal epithelial cells ameliorates ER stress-induced intestinal inflammation and eases NF-kappa B overactivation and intestinal epithelial cell death. ER stress, autophagy induction and spontaneous ileitis emerge from Paneth-cell-specific deletion of Xbp1. Genetically and environmentally controlled UPR function within Paneth cells may therefore set the threshold for the development of intestinal inflammation upon hypomorphic ATG16L1 function and implicate ileal Crohn's disease as a specific disorder of Paneth cells.","[Adolph, Timon E.; Niederreiter, Lukas; Tschurtschenthaler, Markus; Raine, Tim; Kaser, Arthur] Univ Cambridge, Addenbrookes Hosp, Dept Med, Div Gastroenterol & Hepatol, Cambridge CB2 0QQ, England; [Tomczak, Michal F.; Ko, Hyun-Jeong; Hosomi, Shuhei; Flak, Magdalena B.; Cusick, Jennifer L.; Blumberg, Richard S.] Harvard Univ, Brigham & Womens Hosp, Sch Med, Div Gastroenterol,Dept Med, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Boeck, Janne; Billmann-Born, Susanne; Bharti, Richa; Schreiber, Stefan; Rosenstiel, Philip] Univ Kiel, Inst Clin Mol Biol, D-24105 Kiel, Germany; [Martinez-Naves, Eduardo] Univ Complutense Madrid, Fac Med, Dept Microbiol & Immunol, E-28040 Madrid, Spain; [Glickman, Jonathan N.] Miraca Life Sci, GI Pathol Div, Newton, MA 02464 USA; [Tschurtschenthaler, Markus] Med Univ Innsbruck, Dept Med, A-6020 Innsbruck, Austria; [Hartwig, John] Harvard Univ, Brigham & Womens Hosp, Sch Med, Translat Med Div,Dept Med, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Kohno, Kenji] Nara Inst Sci & Technol NAIST, Grad Sch Biol Sci, Lab Mol & Cell Genet, Nara 6300192, Japan; [Iwawaki, Takao] Gunma Univ, Adv Sci Res Leaders Dev Unit, Maebashi, Gunma 3718511, Japan; [Iwawaki, Takao] RIKEN, Adv Sci Inst, Iwawaki Initiat Res Unit, Wako, Saitama 3510198, Japan; [Lucius, Ralph] Univ Kiel, Anat Inst, D-24098 Kiel, Germany; [Kweon, Mi-Na] Int Vaccine Inst, Div Sci Lab, Mucosal Immunol Sect, Seoul 151818, South Korea; [Marciniak, Stefan J.] Univ Cambridge, Dept Med, Cambridge Inst Med Res CIMR, Cambridge CB2 0XY, England; [Choi, Augustine] Harvard Univ, Brigham & Womens Hosp, Sch Med, Div Pulm & Crit Care Med,Dept Med, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Hagen, Susan J.] Beth Israel Deaconess Med Ctr, Dept Surg, Boston, MA 02215 USA","Blumberg, RS (reprint author), Harvard Univ, Brigham & Womens Hosp, Sch Med, Div Gastroenterol,Dept Med, 75 Francis St, Boston, MA 02115 USA.",ak729@cam.ac.uk; rblumberg@partners.org,"; Schreiber, Stefan/B-6748-2008; Lucius, Ralph/B-1614-2010; Flak, Magdalena/M-7106-2016","Rosenstiel, Philip/0000-0002-9692-8828; Schreiber, Stefan/0000-0003-2254-7771; MARTINEZ-NAVES, EDUARDO/0000-0001-8136-9042; Marciniak, Stefan/0000-0001-8472-7183; Flak, Magdalena/0000-0002-8238-9835; Glickman, Jonathan/0000-0003-0910-2655; Tschurtschenthaler, Markus/0000-0002-0060-4790","NIH [DK044319, DK051362, DK053056, DK088199]; Harvard Digestive Diseases Center (HDDC) [DK0034854]; European Research Council under the European Community/ERC [260961]; National Institute for Health Research Cambridge Biomedical Research Centre; Austrian Science Fund; Ministry of Science [P21530-B18, START Y446-B18]; Addenbrooke's Charitable Trust; BMBF NGFN Animal Model grant; DFG Cluster of Excellence Inflammation at Interfaces; EU; Hans-Dietrich Bruhn Memorial Foundation; DFG [RO2994/5-1, SFB 877]; Inflammatory Bowel Disease Working Group; Crohn's and Colitis Foundation of America; European Crohn's and Colitis Organization; Crohn's in Childhood Research Association; National Research Foundation of Korea; Korean government [KRF-2008-357-E00022, 2011-0009018]","We thank L.

However, earlier studies of anti-human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) neutralizing antibodies administered to infected individuals or humanized mice reported poor control of virus replication and the rapid emergence of resistant variants(5-7). A new generation of anti-HIV-1 monoclonal antibodies, possessing extraordinary potency and breadth of neutralizing activity, has recently been isolated from infected individuals(8). These neutralizing antibodies target different regions of the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein including the CD4-binding site, glycans located in the V1/V2, V3 and V4 regions, and the membrane proximal external region of gp41 (refs 9-14). Here we have examined two of the new antibodies, directed to the CD4-binding site and the V3 region (3BNC117 and 10-1074, respectively), for their ability to block infection and suppress viraemia in macaques infected with the R5 tropic simian-human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV)-AD8, which emulates many of the pathogenic and immunogenic properties of HIV-1 during infections of rhesus macaques(15,16). Either antibody alone can potently block virus acquisition. When administered individually to recently infected macaques, the 10-1074 antibody caused a rapid decline in virus load to undetectable levels for 4-7 days, followed by virus rebound during which neutralization-resistant variants became detectable. When administered together, a single treatment rapidly suppressed plasma viraemia for 3-5 weeks in some long-term chronically SHIV-infected animals with low CD41 T-cell levels. A second cycle of anti-HIV-1 monoclonal antibody therapy, administered to two previously treated animals, successfully controlled virus rebound. These results indicate that immunotherapy or a combination of immunotherapy plus conventional antiretroviral drugs might be useful as a treatment for chronically HIV-1-infected individuals experiencing immune dysfunction.","[Shingai, Masashi; Nishimura, Yoshiaki; Donau, Olivia K.; Plishka, Ronald; Buckler-White, Alicia; Martin, Malcolm A.] NIAID, Lab Mol Microbiol, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Klein, Florian; Nussenzweig, Michel C.] Rockefeller Univ, Lab Mol Immunol, New York, NY 10065 USA; [Mouquet, Hugo] Inst Pasteur, Dept Immunol, Lab Humoral Response Pathogens, F-75015 Paris, France; [Seaman, Michael] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Beth Israel Deaconess Med Ctr, Ctr Virol & Vaccine Res, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Piatak, Michael, Jr.; Lifson, Jeffrey D.] SAIC Frederick Inc, AIDS & Canc Virus Program, Frederick Natl Lab Canc Res, Frederick, MD 21702 USA; [Dimitrov, Dimiter S.; Nussenzweig, Michel C.] NCI, Ctr Canc Res, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Nussenzweig, Michel C.] Rockefeller Univ, Howard Hughes Med Inst, New York, NY 10065 USA","Nussenzweig, MC (reprint author), Rockefeller Univ, Lab Mol Immunol, New York, NY 10065 USA.",nussen@mail.rockefeller.edu; malm@nih.gov,"Mouquet, Hugo/M-2750-2014",,"Intramural Research Program of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health (NIH); National Cancer Institute, NIH [HHSN261200800001E]","We thank K.

The actin-related proteins 2 and 3 (Arp2/3) complex is the molecular machine that nucleates these branched actin networks(3). This machine is activated at the leading edge of migrating cells by Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (WASP)-family verprolin-homologous protein (WAVE, also known as SCAR). The WAVE complex is itself directly activated by the small GTPase Rac, which induces lamellipodia(4-6). However, how cells regulate the directionality of migration is poorly understood. Here we identify a new protein, Arpin, that inhibits the Arp2/3 complex in vitro, and show that Rac signalling recruits and activates Arpin at the lamellipodial tip, like WAVE. Consistently, after depletion of the inhibitory Arpin, lamellipodia protrude faster and cells migrate faster. A major role of this inhibitory circuit, however, is to control directional persistence of migration. Indeed, Arpin depletion in both mammalian cells and Dictyostelium discoideum amoeba resulted in straighter trajectories, whereas Arpin microinjection in fish keratocytes, one of the most persistent systems of cell migration, induced these cells to turn. The coexistence of the Rac-Arpin-Arp2/3 inhibitory circuit with the Rac-WAVE-Arp2/3 activatory circuit can account for this conserved role of Arpin in steering cell migration.","[Dang, Irene; Gorelik, Roman; Sousa-Blin, Carla; Derivery, Emmanuel; Henriot, Veronique; David, Violaine; Oguievetskaia, Ksenia; Lakisic, Goran; Pierre, Fabienne; Gautreau, Alexis] CNRS, Grp Cytoskeleton Cell Morphogenesis, Lab Enzymol & Biochim Struct, UPR3082, F-91190 Gif Sur Yvette, France; [Guerin, Christophe; Blanchoin, Laurent] CNRS CEA INRA UJF, Lab Physiol Cellulaire & Vegetale, Inst Rech Technol & Sci Vivant IRTSV, F-38054 Grenoble, France; [Linkner, Joern; Faix, Jan] Hannover Med Sch, Inst Biophys Chem, D-30625 Hannover, Germany; [Nemethova, Maria; Small, J.

The predominant view in the field is that cells in embryos navigate along pre-patterned chemoattractant gradients(2). One hypothetical way to free migrating collectives from the requirement of long-range gradients would be through the self-generation of local gradients that travel with them(4,5), a strategy that potentially allows self-determined directionality. However, a lack of tools for the visualization of endogenous guidance cues has prevented the demonstration of such self-generated gradients in vivo. Here we define the in vivo dynamics of one key guidance molecule, the chemokine Cxcl12a, by applying a fluorescent timer approach to measure ligand-triggered receptor turnover in living animals. Using the zebrafish lateral line primordium as a model, we show that migrating cell collectives can self-generate gradients of chemokine activity across their length via polarized receptor-mediated internalization. Finally, by engineering an external source of the atypical receptor Cxcr7 that moves with the primordium, we show that a self-generated gradient mechanism is sufficient to direct robust collective migration. This study thus provides, to our knowledge, the first in vivo proof for self-directed tissue migration through local shaping of an extracellular cue and provides a framework for investigating self-directed migration in many other contexts including cancer invasion(6).","[Dona, Erika; Barry, Joseph D.; Valentin, Guillaume; Quirin, Charlotte; Kunze, Andreas; Durdu, Sevi; Newton, Lionel R.; Fernandez-Minan, Ana; Huber, Wolfgang; Gilmour, Darren] EMBL Heidelberg, D-69117 Heidelberg, Germany; [Khmelinskii, Anton; Knop, Michael] Heidelberg Univ, Zentrum Mol Biol, Deutsch Krebsforschungszentrum, DKFZ ZMBH Allianz, D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany","Gilmour, D (reprint author), EMBL Heidelberg, Meyerhofstr 1, D-69117 Heidelberg, Germany.",gilmour@embl.de,"Khmelinskii, Anton/B-2830-2008","Huber, Wolfgang/0000-0002-0474-2218; Dona, Erika/0000-0001-9268-3619; Khmelinskii, Anton/0000-0002-0256-5190; Barry, Joseph/0000-0002-1177-5771; Durdu, Sevi/0000-0001-9746-6779",European Commission's FP7 Network of Excellence 'Systems Microscopy'; Marie Curie FP6; European Molecular Biology Organization; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft [SFB 488],"We are grateful to J.

One strategy is to identify the long-range looping interactions at these elements with the use of chromosome conformation capture (3C)-based techniques(4). However, previous studies lack either the resolution or coverage to permit a whole-genome, unbiased view of chromatin interactions. Here we report a comprehensive chromatin interaction map generated in human fibroblasts using a genome-wide 3C analysis method (Hi-C)(5). We determined over one million long-range chromatin interactions at 5-10-kb resolution, and uncovered general principles of chromatin organization at different types of genomic features. We also characterized the dynamics of promoter-enhancer contacts after TNF-alpha signalling in these cells. Unexpectedly, we found that TNF-alpha-responsive enhancers are already in contact with their target promoters before signalling. Such pre-existing chromatin looping, which also exists in other cell types with different extracellular signalling, is a strong predictor of gene induction. Our observations suggest that the three-dimensional chromatin landscape, once established in a particular cell type, is relatively stable and could influence the selection or activation of target genes by a ubiquitous transcription activator in a cell-specific manner.","[Jin, Fulai; Li, Yan; Dixon, Jesse R.; Selvaraj, Siddarth; Ye, Zhen; Lee, Ah Young; Yen, Chia-An; Schmitt, Anthony D.; Espinoza, Celso A.; Ren, Bing] Ludwig Inst Canc Res, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Dixon, Jesse R.] Univ Calif San Diego, UCSD Med Scientist Training Program, Sch Med, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Selvaraj, Siddarth] Univ Calif San Diego, UCSD Bioinformat & Syst Biol Grad Program, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Schmitt, Anthony D.] Univ Calif San Diego, UCSD Biomed Sci Grad Program, Sch Med, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Ren, Bing] Univ Calif San Diego, Sch Med, Moores Canc Ctr, Dept Cellular & Mol Med,Inst Genome Med, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA","Ren, B (reprint author), Ludwig Inst Canc Res, 9500 Gilman Dr, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.",biren@ucsd.edu,,,"Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research; California Institute of Regenerative Medicine [RN2-00905]; US National Institutes of Health [P50 GM085764-03, U01 ES017166]","We thank C.

Here we determine binding sites, bound conformations and specific drug-receptor interactions for several allosteric modulators of the M2 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (M2 receptor), a prototypical family A GPCR, using atomic-level simulations in which the modulators spontaneously associate with the receptor. Despite substantial structural diversity, all modulators form cation-p interactions with clusters of aromatic residues in the receptor extracellular vestibule, approximately 15 angstrom from the classical, 'orthosteric' ligand-binding site. We validate the observed modulator binding modes through radioligand binding experiments on receptor mutants designed, on the basis of our simulations, either to increase or to decrease modulator affinity. Simulations also revealed mechanisms that contribute to positive and negative allosteric modulation of classical ligand binding, including coupled conformational changes of the two binding sites and electrostatic interactions between ligands in these sites. These observations enabled the design of chemical modifications that substantially alter a modulator's allosteric effects. Our findings thus provide a structural basis for the rational design of allosteric modulators targeting muscarinic and possibly other GPCRs.","[Dror, Ron O.; Green, Hillary F.; Borhani, David W.; Valcourt, James R.; Pan, Albert C.; Arlow, Daniel H.; Shaw, David E.] DE Shaw Res, New York, NY 10036 USA; [Valant, Celine; Canals, Meritxell; Lane, J.

This uncertainty affects our ability to estimate how sensitive the climate is to greenhouse gas emissions. Here we perform a sensitivity analysis on a global model to quantify the uncertainty in cloud radiative forcing over the industrial period caused by uncertainties in aerosol emissions and processes. Our results show that 45 per cent of the variance of aerosol forcing since about 1750 arises from uncertainties in natural emissions of volcanic sulphur dioxide, marine dimethylsulphide, biogenic volatile organic carbon, biomass burning and sea spray. Only 34 per cent of the variance is associated with anthropogenic emissions. The results point to the importance of understanding pristine pre-industrial-like environments, with natural aerosols only, and suggest that improved measurements and evaluation of simulated aerosols in polluted present-day conditions will not necessarily result in commensurate reductions in the uncertainty of forcing estimates.","[Carslaw, K.

However, SHANK3 overexpression per se has not been established as a cause of human disorders because 22q13 duplications involve several genes. Here we report that Shank3 transgenic mice modelling a human SHANK3 duplication exhibit manic-like behaviour and seizures consistent with synaptic excitatory/inhibitory imbalance. We also identified two patients with hyperkinetic disorders carrying the smallest SHANK3-spanning duplications reported so far. These findings indicate that SHANK3 overexpression causes a hyperkinetic neuropsychiatric disorder. To probe the mechanism underlying the phenotype, we generated a Shank3 in vivo interactome and found that Shank3 directly interacts with the Arp2/3 complex to increase F-actin levels in Shank3 transgenic mice. The mood-stabilizing drug valproate, but not lithium, rescues the manic-like behaviour of Shank3 transgenic mice raising the possibility that this hyperkinetic disorder has a unique pharmacogenetic profile.","[Han, Kihoon; Schaaf, Christian P.; Lu, Hui; Kang, Hyojin; Cheung, Sau Wai; Yu, Peng; Breman, Amy M.; Patel, Ankita; Zoghbi, Huda Y.] Baylor Coll Med, Dept Mol & Human Genet, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Han, Kihoon; Lu, Hui; Zoghbi, Huda Y.] Baylor Coll Med, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Han, Kihoon; Holder, J.

In particular, individual prefrontal neurons often generate remarkably complex responses that defy deep understanding of their contribution to behaviour. Here we study prefrontal cortex activity in macaque monkeys trained to flexibly select and integrate noisy sensory inputs towards a choice. We find that the observed complexity and functional roles of single neurons are readily understood in the framework of a dynamical process unfolding at the level of the population. The population dynamics can be reproduced by a trained recurrent neural network, which suggests a previously unknown mechanism for selection and integration of task-relevant inputs. This mechanism indicates that selection and integration are two aspects of a single dynamical process unfolding within the same prefrontal circuits, and potentially provides a novel, general framework for understanding context-dependent computations.","[Mante, Valerio; Newsome, William T.] Stanford Univ, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Mante, Valerio; Shenoy, Krishna V.; Newsome, William T.] Stanford Univ, Dept Neurobiol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Sussillo, David; Shenoy, Krishna V.] Stanford Univ, Dept Elect Engn, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Sussillo, David; Shenoy, Krishna V.] Stanford Univ, Neurosci Program, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Shenoy, Krishna V.] Stanford Univ, Dept Bioengn, Stanford, CA 94305 USA","Mante, V (reprint author), Univ Zurich, ETH Zurich, Inst Neuroinformat, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland.",valerio@ini.phys.ethz.ch; sussillo@stanford.edu,,"Sussillo, David/0000-0003-1620-1264",HHMI; Air Force Research Laboratory [FA9550-07-1-0537]; NIH Director's Pioneer Award [1DP1OD006409]; DARPA REPAIR [N66001-10-C-2010],"We thank J.

Here we present the crystal structure of the Drosophila melanogaster dopamine transporter at 3.0 angstrom resolution bound to the tricyclic antidepressant nortriptyline. The transporter is locked in an outward-open conformation with nortriptyline wedged between transmembrane helices 1, 3,6 and 8, blocking the transporter from binding substrate and from isomerizing to an inward-facing conformation. Although the overall structure of the dopamine transporter is similar to that of its prokaryotic relative LeuT, there are multiple distinctions, including a kink in transmembrane helix 12 halfway across the membrane bilayer, a latch-like carboxy-terminal helix that caps the cytoplasmic gate, and a cholesterol molecule wedged within a groove formed by transmembrane helices 1a, 5 and 7. Taken together, the dopamine transporter structure reveals the molecular basis for antidepressant action on sodium-coupled neurotransmitter symporters and elucidates critical elements of eukaryotic transporter structure and modulation by lipids, thus expanding our understanding of the mechanism and regulation of neurotransmitter uptake at chemical synapses.","[Penmatsa, Aravind; Wang, Kevin H.; Gouaux, Eric] Oregon Hlth & Sci Univ, Vollum Inst, Portland, OR 97239 USA; [Gouaux, Eric] Oregon Hlth & Sci Univ, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Portland, OR 97239 USA","Gouaux, E (reprint author), Oregon Hlth & Sci Univ, Vollum Inst, 3181 South West Sam Jackson Pk Rd, Portland, OR 97239 USA.",gouauxe@ohsu.edu,,,American Heart Association; National Institute of Mental Health; National Institutes of Health,"We thank D.

L.",,,Demonstration of electron acceleration in a laser-driven dielectric microstructure,NATURE,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"The enormous size and cost of current state-of-the-art accelerators based on conventional radio-frequency technology has spawned great interest in the development of new acceleration concepts that are more compact and economical. Micro-fabricated dielectric laser accelerators (DLAs) are an attractive approach, because such dielectric microstructures can support accelerating fields one to two orders of magnitude higher than can radio-frequency cavity-based accelerators. DLAs use commercial lasers as a power source, which are smaller and less expensive than the radio-frequency klystrons that power today's accelerators. In addition, DLAs are fabricated via low-cost, lithographic techniques that can be used for mass production. However, despite several DLA structures having been proposed recently(1-4), no successful demonstration of acceleration in these structures has so far been shown. Here we report high-gradient (beyond 250 MeV m(-1)) acceleration of electrons in a DLA. Relativistic (60-MeV) electrons are energy-modulated over 563 +/- 104 optical periods of a fused silica grating structure, powered by a 800-nm-wavelength mode-locked Ti:sapphire laser. The observed results are in agreement with analytical models and electrodynamic simulations. By comparison, conventional modern linear accelerators operate at gradients of 10-30 MeV m(-1), and the first linear radio-frequency cavity accelerator was ten radio-frequency periods (one metre) long with a gradient of approximately 1.6 MeV m(-1) (ref. 5). Our results set the stage for the development of future multi-staged DLA devices composed of integrated on-chip systems. This would enable compact table-top accelerators on the MeV-GeV (10(6)-10(9) eV) scale for security scanners and medical therapy, university-scale X-ray light sources for biological and materials research, and portable medical imaging devices, and would substantially reduce the size and cost of a future collider on the multi-TeV (10(12) eV) scale.","[Peralta, E.

This consistent behaviour strongly contrasts with the difference in communication abilities between the individuals. On the basis of this universal feature, it has been proposed that alignment rules at the individual level could solely account for the emergence of unidirectional motion at the group level(1-4). This hypothesis has been supported by agent-based simulations(1,5,6). However, more complex collective behaviours have been systematically found in experiments, including the formation of vortices(7-9), fluctuating swarms(7,10), clustering(11,12) and swirling(13-16). All these (living and man-made) model systems (bacteria(9,10,16), biofilaments and molecular motors(7,8,13), shaken grains(14,15) and reactive colloids(11,12)) predominantly rely on actual collisions to generate collective motion. As a result, the potential local alignment rules are entangled with more complex, and often unknown, interactions. The large-scale behaviour of the populations therefore strongly depends on these uncontrolled microscopic couplings, which are extremely challenging to measure and describe theoretically. Here we report that dilute populations of millions of colloidal rolling particles self-organize to achieve coherentmotion in a unique direction, with very few density and velocity fluctuations. Quantitatively identifying the microscopic interactions between the rollers allows a theoretical description of this polar-liquid state. Comparison of the theory with experiment suggests that hydrodynamic interactions promote the emergence of collective motion either in the form of a single macroscopic 'flock', at low densities, or in that of a homogenous polar phase, at higher densities. Furthermore, hydrodynamics protects the polar-liquid state from the giant density fluctuations that were hitherto considered the hallmark of populations of self-propelled particles(2,3,17). Our experiments demonstrate that genuine physical interactions at the individual level are sufficient to set homogeneous active populations into stable directed motion.","[Bricard, Antoine; Caussin, Jean-Baptiste; Desreumaux, Nicolas; Bartolo, Denis] Univ Paris Diderot, ESPCI ParisTech, CNRS UMR7636, PMMH, F-75005 Paris, France; [Bricard, Antoine; Caussin, Jean-Baptiste; Desreumaux, Nicolas; Bartolo, Denis] Univ Paris 06, F-75005 Paris, France; [Caussin, Jean-Baptiste; Bartolo, Denis] Ecole Normale Super Lyon, Phys Lab, CNRS UMR5672, F-69007 Lyon, France; [Dauchot, Olivier] ESPCI ParisTech, EC2M, CNRS Gulliver UMR7083, F-75005 Paris, France","Bartolo, D (reprint author), Univ Paris Diderot, ESPCI ParisTech, CNRS UMR7636, PMMH, 10 Rue Vauquelin, F-75005 Paris, France.",denis.bartolo@ens-lyon.fr,"bartolo, denis/B-5537-2015; Dauchot, Olivier/D-7156-2015","bartolo, denis/0000-0001-5035-6898; Dauchot, Olivier/0000-0002-7039-5787",Paris Emergence programme; C'Nano IdF; Institut Universitaire de France,"We acknowledge support from the Paris Emergence programme (D.

Existing assembly schemes(10-15) can position colloids of one type relatively flexibly into a range of desired structures, but it remains challenging to produce multicomponent lattices, clusters with precisely controlled symmetries and three-dimensional assemblies(16). A few schemes can efficiently produce complex colloidal structures(2,17,18), but they require system-specific procedures. Here we show that magnetic field microgradients established in a paramagnetic fluid(19,20) can serve as 'virtual moulds' to act as templates for the assembly of large numbers (similar to 10(8)) of both non-magnetic and magnetic colloidal particles with micrometre precision and typical yields of 80 to 90 per cent. We illustrate the versatility of this approach by producing single-component and multicomponent colloidal arrays, complex three-dimensional structures and a variety of colloidal molecules from polymeric particles, silica particles and live bacteria and by showing that all of these structures can be made permanent. In addition, although our magnetic moulds currently resemble optical traps in that they are limited to the manipulation of micrometre-sized objects, they are massively parallel and can manipulate non-magnetic and magnetic objects simultaneously in two and three dimensions.","[Demiroers, Ahmet F.; Pillai, Pramod P.; Kowalczyk, Bartlomiej; Grzybowski, Bartosz A.] Northwestern Univ, Dept Chem, Evanston, IL 60208 USA; [Demiroers, Ahmet F.; Pillai, Pramod P.; Kowalczyk, Bartlomiej; Grzybowski, Bartosz A.] Northwestern Univ, Dept Chem & Biol Engn, Evanston, IL 60208 USA","Grzybowski, BA (reprint author), Northwestern Univ, Dept Chem, 2145 Sheridan Rd, Evanston, IL 60208 USA.",grzybor@northwestern.edu,"Grzybowski, Bartosz/B-7644-2009; Pillai, Pramod/G-8334-2015","Demirors, Ahmet/0000-0002-2748-1516","US Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences [DE-SC0000989]; Non-equilibrium Energy Research Center, Energy Frontier Research Center","We thank P.

Quantitative models of these processes require knowledge of the structural changes and compression mechanisms that take place in liquid silicates at the high pressures and temperatures in the Earth's interior. However, obtaining such knowledge has long been impeded by the challenging nature of the experiments. In recent years, structural and density information for silica glass was obtained at record pressures of up to 100 GPa (ref. 1), a major step towards obtaining data on the molten state. Here we report the structure of molten basalt up to 60 GPa by means of in situ X-ray diffraction. The coordination of silicon increases from four under ambient conditions to six at 35 GPa, similar to what has been reported in silica glass(1-3). The compressibility of the melt after the completion of the coordination change is lower than at lower pressure, implying that only a high-order equation of state can accurately describe the density evolution of silicate melts over the pressure range of the whole mantle. The transition pressure coincides with a marked change in the pressure-evolution of nickel partitioning between molten iron and molten silicates, indicating that melt compressibility controls siderophile-element partitioning.","[Sanloup, Chrystele; Drewitt, James W.

Simple population genetic models are not sufficient to explain the high levels of genetic diversity sometimes observed in ecologically important traits(2). In guppies (Poecilia reticulata), male colour pattern is both diverse and heritable, and is arguably one of the most extreme examples of morphological polymorphism known(4,5). Negative frequency-dependent selection (NFDS), a form of selection in which genotypes are favoured when they are rare(6), can potentially maintain such extensive polymorphism, but few experimental studies have confirmed its operation in nature(7,8). Here we use highly replicated experimental manipulations of natural populations to show that males with rare colour patterns have higher reproductive fitness, demonstrating NFDS mediated by sexual selection. Rare males acquired more mates and sired more offspring compared to common males and, as previously reported, had higher rates of survival(8). Orange colour, implicated in other studies of sexual selection in guppies, did predict male reproductive success, but only in one of three populations. These data support the hypothesis that NFDS maintains diversity in the colour patterns of male guppies through two selective agents, mates and predators. Similar field-based manipulations of genotype frequencies could provide a powerful approach to reveal the underlying ecological and behavioural mechanisms that maintain genetic and phenotypic diversity.","[Hughes, Kimberly A.] Florida State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA; [Houde, Anne E.] Lake Forest Coll, Dept Biol, Lake Forest, IL 60045 USA; [Price, Anna C.; Rodd, F.

A brain region proposed to play a role in appetite suppression is the parabrachial nucleus(1-3), a heterogeneous population of neurons surrounding the superior cerebellar peduncle in the brainstem. The parabrachial nucleus is thought to mediate the suppression of appetite induced by the anorectic hormones amylin and cholecystokinin(2), as well as by lithium chloride and lipopolysaccharide, compounds that mimic the effects of toxic foods and bacterial infections, respectively(4-6). Hyperactivity of the parabrachial nucleus is also thought to cause starvation after ablation of orexigenic agouti-related peptide neurons in adult mice(1,7). However, the identities of neurons in the parabrachial nucleus that regulate feeding are unknown, as are the functionally relevant downstream projections. Here we identify calcitonin gene-related peptide-expressing neurons in the outer external lateral subdivision of the parabrachial nucleus that project to the laterocapsular division of the central nucleus of the amygdala as forming a functionally important circuit for suppressing appetite. Using genetically encoded anatomical, optogenetic(8) and pharmacogenetic(9) tools, we demonstrate that activation of these neurons projecting to the central nucleus of the amygdala suppresses appetite. In contrast, inhibition of these neurons increases food intake in circumstances when mice do not normally eat and prevents starvation in adult mice whose agouti-related peptide neurons are ablated. Taken together, our data demonstrate that this neural circuit from the parabrachial nucleus to the central nucleus of the amygdala mediates appetite suppression in conditions when it is unfavourable to eat. This neural circuit may provide targets for therapeutic intervention to overcome or promote appetite.","[Carter, Matthew E.; Palmiter, Richard D.] Univ Washington, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Carter, Matthew E.; Palmiter, Richard D.] Univ Washington, Dept Biochem, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Soden, Marta E.; Zweifel, Larry S.] Univ Washington, Dept Pharmacol, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Soden, Marta E.; Zweifel, Larry S.] Univ Washington, Dept Psychiat, Seattle, WA 98195 USA","Palmiter, RD (reprint author), Univ Washington, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.",palmiter@uw.edu,"Zweifel, Larry/O-3284-2017","Zweifel, Larry/0000-0003-3465-5331","Hilda and Preston Davis Foundation; National Institutes of Health [R01MH094536, R01DA024908]; Klarman Family Foundation","We thank B.

Although such events have been observed in many neuronal types(4-9), it is not well understood how active dendrites contribute to the tuning of neuronal output in vivo. Here we show that dendritic spikes increase the selectivity of neuronal responses to the orientation of a visual stimulus (orientation tuning). We performed direct patch-clamp recordings from the dendrites of pyramidal neurons in the primary visual cortex of lightly anaesthetized and awake mice, during sensory processing. Visual stimulation triggered regenerative local dendritic spikes that were distinct from back-propagating action potentials. These events were orientation tuned and were suppressed by either hyperpolarization of membrane potential or intracellular blockade of NMDA(N-methyl-D-aspartate) receptors. Both of these manipulations also decreased the selectivity of subthreshold orientation tuning measured at the soma, thus linking dendritic regenerative events to somatic orientation tuning. Together, our results suggest that dendritic spikes that are triggered by visual input contribute to a fundamental cortical computation: enhancing orientation selectivity in the visual cortex. Thus, dendritic excitability is an essential component of behaviourally relevant computations in neurons.","[Smith, Spencer L.; Smith, Ikuko T.; Branco, Tiago; Haeusser, Michael] UCL, Wolfson Inst Biomed Res, London WC1E 6BT, England; [Smith, Spencer L.; Smith, Ikuko T.; Branco, Tiago; Haeusser, Michael] UCL, Dept Neurosci Physiol & Pharmacol, London WC1E 6BT, England; [Smith, Spencer L.; Smith, Ikuko T.] Univ N Carolina, Sch Med, Dept Cell Biol & Physiol, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA; [Smith, Spencer L.; Smith, Ikuko T.] Univ N Carolina, Sch Med, Ctr Neurosci, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA; [Branco, Tiago] MRC, Mol Biol Lab, Cambridge CB2 0QH, England","Smith, SL (reprint author), UCL, Wolfson Inst Biomed Res, Gower St, London WC1E 6BT, England.",slab@unc.edu; m.hausser@ucl.ac.uk,,,Long-Term Fellowship; Career Development Award from the Human Frontier Science Program; Klingenstein Fellowship; Helen Lyng White Fellowship; Wellcome Trust; Royal Society; MRC; ERC; Gatsby Charitable Foundation,"We are grateful to B.

Inhibitory synapses that form on pyramidal neuron dendrites modulate the summation of excitatory synaptic potentials(4-6) and prevent the generation of dendritic calcium spikes(7,8). Precisely timed somatic inhibition limits both the number of action potentials and the time window during which firing can occur(8,9). The activity-dependent transcription factor NPAS4 regulates inhibitory synapse number and function in cell culture(10), but how this transcription factor affects the inhibitory inputs that form on distinct domains of a neuron in vivo was unclear. Here we show that in the mouse hippocampus behaviourally driven expression of NPAS4 coordinates the redistribution of inhibitory synapses made onto a CA1 pyramidal neuron, simultaneously increasing inhibitory synapse number on the cell body while decreasing the number of inhibitory synapses on the apical dendrites. This rearrangement of inhibition is mediated in part by the NPAS4 target gene brain derived neurotrophic factor (Bdnf), which specifically regulates somatic, and not dendritic, inhibition. These findings indicate that sensory stimuli, by inducing NPAS4 and its target genes, differentially control spatial features of neuronal inhibition in a way that restricts the output of the neuron while creating a dendritic environment that is permissive for plasticity.","[Bloodgood, Brenda L.; Sharma, Nikhil; Browne, Heidi Adlman; Trepman, Alissa Z.; Greenberg, Michael E.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Neurobiol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Bloodgood, Brenda L.] Univ Calif San Diego, Div Biol Sci, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Sharma, Nikhil] Harvard Univ, Dept Mol & Cellular Biol, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA","Greenberg, ME (reprint author), Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Neurobiol, Boston, MA 02115 USA.",Michael_Greenberg@hms.harvard.edu,,,Helen Hay Whitney Foundation; L'Oreal USA Fellowship for Women in Science; Medical Foundation/Charles A.

Familial recurrence is extremely rare and causal genes have not been identified. Although the onset of fibrosis in SSc typically correlates with the production of autoantibodies, whether they contribute to disease pathogenesis or simply serve as a marker of disease remains controversial and the mechanism for their induction is largely unknown(2). The study of SSc is hindered by a lack of animal models that recapitulate the aetiology of this complex disease. To gain a foothold in the pathogenesis of pathological skin fibrosis, we studied stiff skin syndrome (SSS), a rare but tractable Mendelian disorder leading to childhood onset of diffuse skin fibrosis with autosomal dominant inheritance and complete penetrance. We showed previously that SSS is caused by heterozygous missense mutations in the gene (FBN1) encoding fibrillin-1, the main constituent of extracellular microfibrils(3). SSS mutations all localize to the only domain in fibrillin-1 that harbours an Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) motif needed to mediate cell-matrix interactions by binding to cell-surface integrins(3). Here we show that mouse lines harbouring analogous amino acid substitutions in fibrillin-1 recapitulate aggressive skin fibrosis that is prevented by integrin-modulating therapies and reversed by antagonism of the pro-fibrotic cytokine transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta). Mutant mice show skin infiltration of pro-inflammatory immune cells including plasmacytoid dendritic cells, T helper cells and plasma cells, and also autoantibody production; these findings are normalized by integrin-modulating therapies or TGF-beta antagonism. These results show that alterations in cell-matrix interactions are sufficient to initiate and sustain inflammatory and pro-fibrotic programmes and highlight new therapeutic strategies.","[Gerber, Elizabeth E.; Gallo, Elena M.; Fontana, Stefani C.; Dietz, Harry C.] Johns Hopkins Univ, Sch Med, McKusick Nathans Inst Genet Med, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA; [Davis, Elaine C.] McGill Univ, Montreal, PQ H3A 2K6, Canada; [Wigley, Fredrick M.] Johns Hopkins Univ, Sch Med, Dept Med, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA; [Huso, David L.] Johns Hopkins Univ, Sch Med, Dept Mol & Comparat Pathobiol, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA; [Dietz, Harry C.] Howard Hughes Med Inst, Chevy Chase, MD 20815 USA","Dietz, HC (reprint author), Johns Hopkins Univ, Sch Med, McKusick Nathans Inst Genet Med, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA.",hdietz@jhmi.edu,,,"Scleroderma Research Foundation; National Institutes of Health [RO1-AR41135, PO1-AR049698]; National Marfan Foundation; Smilow Center for Marfan Syndrome Research; Howard Hughes Medical Institute","We thank those who contributed skin biopsies to this study and those who provided reagents for this study, including S.

Antagonists of the platelet integrin alpha(IIb)beta(3) are potent anti-thrombotic drugs, but also have the life-threatening adverse effect of causing bleeding(2,3). It is therefore desirable to develop new antagonists that do not cause bleeding. Integrins transmit signals bidirectionally(4,5). Inside-out signalling activates integrins through a talin-dependent mechanism(6,7). Integrin ligation mediates thrombus formation and outside-in signalling(8,9), which requires G alpha(13) and greatly expands thrombi. Here we show that G alpha(13) and talin bind to mutually exclusive but distinct sites within the integrin beta(3) cytoplasmic domain in opposing waves. The first talin-binding wave mediates inside-out signalling and also ligand-induced integrin activation, but is not required for outside-in signalling. Integrin ligation induces transient talin dissociation and G alpha(13) binding to an EXE motif (in which X denotes any residue), which selectively mediates outside-in signalling and platelet spreading. The second talin-binding wave is associated with clot retraction. An EXE-motif-based inhibitor of G alpha(13)-integrin interaction selectively abolishes outside-in signalling without affecting integrin ligation, and suppresses occlusive arterial thrombosis without affecting bleeding time. Thus, we have discovered a new mechanism for the directional switch of integrin signalling and, on the basis of this mechanism, designed a potent new anti-thrombotic drug that does not cause bleeding.","[Shen, Bo; Zhao, Xiaojuan; O'Brien, Kelly A.; Stojanovic-Terpo, Aleksandra; Delaney, M.

Post-translational addition of the polysaccharide repeating unit [-3-xylose-alpha 1,3-glucuronic acid-beta 1-](n) by like-acetylglucosaminyltransferase (LARGE) is required for the glycoprotein dystroglycan to function as a receptor for proteins in the extracellular matrix(2,3). Reductions in the amount of [-3-xylose-alpha 1,3-glucuronic acid-beta 1-](n) (hereafter referred to as LARGE-glycan) on dystroglycan result in heterogeneous forms of muscular dystrophy(4). However, neither patient nor mouse studies has revealed a clear correlation between glycosylation status and phenotype(5,6). This disparity can be attributed to our lack of knowledge of the cellular function of the LARGE-glycan repeat. Here we show that coordinated upregulation of Large and dystroglycan in differentiating mouse muscle facilitates rapid extension of LARGE-glycan repeat chains. Using synthesized LARGE-glycan repeats we show a direct correlation between LARGE-glycan extension and its binding capacity for extracellular matrix ligands. Blocking Large upregulation during muscle regeneration results in the synthesis of dystroglycan with minimal LARGE-glycan repeats in association with a less compact basement membrane, immature neuromuscular junctions and dysfunctional muscle predisposed to dystrophy. This was consistent with the finding that patients with increased clinical severity of disease have fewer LARGE-glycan repeats. Our results reveal that the LARGE-glycan of dystroglycan serves as a tunable extracellular matrix protein scaffold, the extension of which is required for normal skeletal muscle function.","[Goddeeris, Matthew M.; Wu, Biming; Venzke, David; Yoshida-Moriguchi, Takako; Campbell, Kevin P.] Univ Iowa, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Roy J & Lucille A Carver Coll Med, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA; [Goddeeris, Matthew M.; Wu, Biming; Venzke, David; Yoshida-Moriguchi, Takako; Campbell, Kevin P.] Univ Iowa, Roy J & Lucille A Carver Coll Med, Dept Mol Physiol, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA; [Saito, Fumiaki; Matsumura, Kiichiro] Teikyo Univ, Sch Med, Dept Neurol & Neurosci, Itabashi Ku, Tokyo 1738605, Japan; [Moore, Steven A.] Univ Iowa, Roy J & Lucille A Carver Coll Med, Dept Pathol, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA; [Campbell, Kevin P.] Univ Iowa, Roy J & Lucille A Carver Coll Med, Dept Neurol, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA; [Campbell, Kevin P.] Univ Iowa, Roy J & Lucille A Carver Coll Med, Dept Internal Med, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA","Campbell, KP (reprint author), Univ Iowa, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Roy J & Lucille A Carver Coll Med, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA.",kevin-campbell@uowa.edu,,,"NIH/NIAMS Ruth L.

Because eukaryotic BATs are recalcitrant to crystallographic analysis, our understanding of the mechanism of these inhibitors and antidepressants is limited. LeuT is a bacterial homologue of BATs and has proven to be a valuable paradigm for understanding relationships between their structure and function(3). However, because only approximately 25% of the amino acid sequence of LeuT is in common with that of BATs, and as LeuT is a promiscuous amino acid transporter(4), it does not recapitulate the pharmacological properties of BATs. Indeed, SSRIs and TCAs bind in the extracellular vestibule of LeuT(5-7) and act as non-competitive inhibitors of transport(5). By contrast, multiple studies demonstrate that both TCAs and SSRIs are competitive inhibitors for eukaryotic BATs and bind to the primary binding pocket(8-16). Here we engineered LeuT to harbour human BAT-like pharmacology by mutating key residues around the primary binding pocket. The final LeuBAT mutant binds the SSRI sertraline with a binding constant of 18 nM and displays high-affinity binding to a range of SSRIs, SNRIs and a TCA. We determined 12 crystal structures of LeuBAT in complex with four classes of antidepressants. The chemically diverse inhibitors have a remarkably similar mode of binding in which they straddle transmembrane helix (TM) 3, wedge between TM3/TM8 and TM1/TM6, and lock the transporter in a sodium-and chloride-bound outward-facing open conformation. Together, these studies define common and simple principles for the action of SSRIs, SNRIs and TCAs on BATs.","[Wang, Hui; Goehring, April; Wang, Kevin H.; Penmatsa, Aravind; Ressler, Ryan; Gouaux, Eric] Oregon Hlth & Sci Univ, Vollum Inst, Portland, OR 97239 USA; [Gouaux, Eric] Oregon Hlth & Sci Univ, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Portland, OR 97239 USA","Gouaux, E (reprint author), Oregon Hlth & Sci Univ, Vollum Inst, 3181 SW Sam Jackson Pk Rd, Portland, OR 97239 USA.",gouauxe@ohsu.edu,"Wang, Hui/C-4051-2012",,National Institutes of Health,"We thank J.

Although various candidate stromal cells have been identified as potential HSC niches, the spatial localization of quiescent HSCs in the bone marrow remains unclear. Here, using a novel approach that combines whole-mount confocal immunofluorescence imaging techniques and computational modelling to analyse significant three-dimensional associations in the mouse bone marrow among vascular structures, stromal cells and HSCs, we show that quiescent HSCs associate specifically with small arterioles that are preferentially found in endosteal bone marrow. These arterioles are ensheathed exclusively by rare NG2 (also known as CSPG4)(+) pericytes, distinct from sinusoid-associated leptin receptor (LEPR)(+) cells. Pharmacological or genetic activation of the HSC cell cycle alters the distribution of HSCs from NG2(+) periarteriolar niches to LEPR+ perisinusoidal niches. Conditional depletion of NG2(+) cells induces HSC cycling and reduces functional long-term repopulating HSCs in the bone marrow. These results thus indicate that arteriolar niches are indispensable for maintaining HSC quiescence.","[Kunisaki, Yuya; Bruns, Ingmar; Scheiermann, Christoph; Ahmed, Jalal; Pinho, Sandra; Zhang, Dachuan; Mizoguchi, Toshihide; Wei, Qiaozhi; Lucas, Daniel; Ito, Keisuke; Frenette, Paul S.] Albert Einstein Coll Med, Ruth L & David S Gottesman Inst Stem Cell & Regen, Bronx, NY 10461 USA; [Kunisaki, Yuya; Bruns, Ingmar; Scheiermann, Christoph; Pinho, Sandra; Zhang, Dachuan; Mizoguchi, Toshihide; Wei, Qiaozhi; Ito, Keisuke; Frenette, Paul S.] Albert Einstein Coll Med, Dept Cell Biol, Bronx, NY 10461 USA; [Bruns, Ingmar] Univ Dusseldorf, Dept Hematol Oncol & Clin Immunol, D-40225 Dusseldorf, Germany; [Ahmed, Jalal] Mt Sinai Sch Med, New York, NY 10029 USA; [Lucas, Daniel; Ito, Keisuke; Frenette, Paul S.] Albert Einstein Coll Med, Dept Med, Bronx, NY 10461 USA; [Mar, Jessica C.; Bergman, Aviv] Albert Einstein Coll Med, Dept Syst & Computat Biol, Bronx, NY 10461 USA; [Mar, Jessica C.] Albert Einstein Coll Med, Dept Epidemiol & Populat Hlth, Bronx, NY 10461 USA","Frenette, PS (reprint author), Albert Einstein Coll Med, Ruth L & David S Gottesman Inst Stem Cell & Regen, Bronx, NY 10461 USA.",paul.frenette@einstein.yu.edu,"Scheiermann, Christoph/B-8261-2014","Scheiermann, Christoph/0000-0002-9212-0995","New York Stem Cell Foundation-Druckenmiller Fellowship; German Research Foundation (DFG) (Emmy-Noether-Program); National Institutes of Health (R01 grants) [DK056638, HL069438, HL097700];  [T32 063754]","We thank P.

An 'expander' element occupies the DNA template site and stabilizes an expanded active centre cleft with an unwound bridge helix. A 'connector' element invades the cleft of an adjacent polymerase and stabilizes an inactive polymerase dimer. The connector and expander must detach during Pol I activation to enable transcription initiation and cleft contraction by convergent movement of the polymerase 'core' and 'shelf' modules. Conversion between an inactive expanded and an active contracted polymerase state may generally underlie transcription. Regulatory factors can modulate the core-shelf interface that includes a 'composite' active site for RNA chain initiation, elongation, proofreading and termination.","[Engel, Christoph; Sainsbury, Sarah; Cheung, Alan C.; Kostrewa, Dirk; Cramer, Patrick] Univ Munich, Gene Ctr, D-81377 Munich, Germany; [Engel, Christoph; Sainsbury, Sarah; Cheung, Alan C.; Kostrewa, Dirk; Cramer, Patrick] Univ Munich, Dept Biochem, Ctr Integrated Prot Sci Munich CIPSM, D-81377 Munich, Germany","Cramer, P (reprint author), Univ Munich, Gene Ctr, Feodor Lynen Str 25, D-81377 Munich, Germany.",cramer@LMB.uni-muenchen.de,,,"Boehringer Ingelheim Fonds; Elite Network Bavaria program 'Protein Dynamics in Health and Disease'; Graduate Research Academy 'RNA Biology' of SFB960; Alexander-von-Humboldt Foundation; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft [SFB646, TR5, GraKo1721, SFB960, CIPSM, NIM]; European Research Council; Jung-Stiftung; Vallee Foundation","We thank C.

Observations of X-ray line emission from this intergalactic medium have suggested a relatively small cluster-to-cluster scatter outside the cluster centres(1,2) and enrichment with iron out to large radii(3-5), leading to the idea that the metal enrichment occurred early in the history of the Universe(3). Models with early enrichment predict a uniform metal distribution at large radii in clusters, whereas those with late-time enrichment(6,7) are expected to introduce significant spatial variations of the metallicity. To discriminate clearly between these competing models, it is essential to test for potential inhomogeneities by measuring the abundances out to large radii along multiple directions in clusters, which has not hitherto been done. Here we report a remarkably uniform iron abundance, as a function of radius and azimuth, that is statistically consistent with a constant value of Z(Fe) = 0.306 +/- 0.012 in solar units out to the edge of the nearby Perseus cluster. This homogeneous distribution requires that most of the metal enrichment of the intergalactic medium occurred before the cluster formed, probably more than ten billion years ago, during the period of maximal star formation and black hole activity.","[Werner, Norbert; Urban, Ondrej; Simionescu, Aurora; Allen, Steven W.] Stanford Univ, Kavli Inst Particle Astrophys & Cosmol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Werner, Norbert; Urban, Ondrej; Simionescu, Aurora; Allen, Steven W.] Stanford Univ, Dept Phys, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Urban, Ondrej; Allen, Steven W.] SLAC Natl Accelerator Lab, Menlo Pk, CA 94025 USA; [Simionescu, Aurora] JAXA, Inst Space & Astronaut Sci ISAS, Chuo Ku, Sagamihara, Kanagawa 2525210, Japan","Werner, N (reprint author), Stanford Univ, Kavli Inst Particle Astrophys & Cosmol, 452 Lomita Mall, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",norbertw@stanford.edu,,,"Suzaku grants [NNX09AV64G, NNX10AR48G]; NASA ADAP grant [NNX12AE05G]; US Department of Energy [DE-AC02-76SF00515]","We are grateful for discussions with other members of the Perseus cluster Suzaku Key project collaboration, as well as with Y.

This is because any perturbation affects all states below the Fermi energy, resulting in a complex superposition of particle and hole excitations. However, it was predicted nearly 20 years ago(1-3) that a Lorentzian time-dependent potential with quantized flux generates a minimal excitation with only one particle and no hole. Here we report that such quasiparticles (hereafter termed levitons) can be generated on demand in a conductor by applying voltage pulses to a contact. Partitioning the excitations with an electronic beam splitter generates a current noise that we use to measure their number. Minimal-excitation states are observed for Lorentzian pulses, whereas for other pulse shapes there are significant contributions from holes. Further identification of levitons is provided in the energy domain with shot-noise spectroscopy, and in the time domain with electronic Hong-Ou-Mandel noise correlations(4-8). The latter, obtained by colliding synchronized levitons on a beam splitter, exemplifies the potential use of levitons for quantum information: using linear electron quantum optics(9) in ballistic conductors, it is possible to imagine flying-qubit(10,11) operation in which the Fermi statistics are exploited(12-14) to entangle synchronized electrons emitted by distinct sources(15-18). Compared with electron sources based on quantum dots(19-21), the generation of levitons does not require delicate nanolithography, considerably simplifying the circuitry for scalability. Levitons are not limited to carrying a single charge, and so in a broader context n-particle levitons could find application in the study of full electron counting statistics(22-25). But they can also carry a fraction of charge if they are implemented in Luttinger liquids(3) or in fractional quantum Hall edge channels(26); this allows the study of Abelian and non-Abelian quasiparticles in the time domain. Finally, the generation technique could be applied to cold atomic gases(27,28), leading to the possibility of atomic levitons.","[Dubois, J.; Jullien, T.; Portier, F.; Roche, P.; Roulleau, P.; Glattli, D.

Electron-phonon coupling can lead to the formation of a Cooper pair out of two repelling electrons, which forms the basis for Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer superconductivity(1). Here we study the interaction of a single localized electron with a Bose-Einstein condensate and show that the electron can excite phonons and eventually trigger a collective oscillation of the whole condensate. We find that the coupling is surprisingly strong compared to that of ionic impurities, owing to the more favourable mass ratio. The electron is held in place by a single charged ionic core, forming a Rydberg bound state. This Rydberg electron is described by a wavefunction extending to a size of up to eight micrometres, comparable to the dimensions of the condensate. In such a state, corresponding to a principal quantum number of n = 202, the Rydberg electron is interacting with several tens of thousands of condensed atoms contained within its orbit. We observe surprisingly long lifetimes and finite size effects caused by the electron exploring the outer regions of the condensate. We anticipate future experiments on electron orbital imaging, the investigation of phonon-mediated coupling of single electrons, and applications in quantum optics.","[Balewski, Jonathan B.; Krupp, Alexander T.; Gaj, Anita; Loew, Robert; Hofferberth, Sebastian; Pfau, Tilman] Univ Stuttgart, Phys Inst 5, D-70569 Stuttgart, Germany; [Peter, David; Buechler, Hans Peter] Univ Stuttgart, Inst Theoret Phys 3, D-70569 Stuttgart, Germany","Pfau, T (reprint author), Univ Stuttgart, Phys Inst 5, Pfaffenwaldring 57, D-70569 Stuttgart, Germany.",t.pfau@physik.uni-stuttgart.de,"Loew, Robert/I-8206-2014; Pfau, Tilman/G-1774-2011","Hofferberth, Sebastian/0000-0003-0309-9715","Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) [SFB/TRR21, PF 381/4-2]; ERC [267100]; EU Marie Curie programme ITN-Coherence [265031]; DFG [HO 4787/1-1]","We thank K.

Yet after decades of study, major uncertainties remain as to the distribution of that ice(2). Here we test four reconstructions of North American deglacial ice-sheet history(3-6) by quantitatively connecting them to high-resolution oxygen isotope (delta O-18) records from the Gulf of Mexico(7-11) using a water mixing model(12). For each reconstruction, we route meltwater(3-6) and seasonal runoff(13-16) through the time-evolving Mississippi drainage basin, which co-evolves with ice geometry(3-6) and changing topography as ice loads deform the solid Earth and produce spatially variable sea level in a process known as glacial isostatic adjustment(17). The delta O-18 records show that the Mississippi-drained southern Laurentide ice sheet contributed only 5.4 +/- 2.1 metres to global sea level rise, of which 0.66 +/- 0.07 metres were released during the meltwater pulse 1A event 14,650-14,310 years before present(18), far less water than previously thought(5,12,19). In contrast, the three reconstructions based on glacial isostatic adjustment(3-5) overpredict the delta O-18-based post-LGM meltwater volume by a factor of 1.6 to 3.6. The fourth reconstruction(6), which is based on ice physics, has a low enough Mississippi-routed meltwater discharge to be consistent with delta O-18 constraints, but also contains the largest LGM North American ice volume. This suggests that modelling based on ice physics may be the best way of matching isotopic records while also sequestering enough water in the North American ice sheets to match the observed LGM sea level fall(1).","[Wickert, Andrew D.; Anderson, Robert S.] Univ Colorado, Inst Arctic & Alpine Res, Boulder, CO 80303 USA; [Wickert, Andrew D.; Anderson, Robert S.] Univ Colorado, Dept Geol Sci, Boulder, CO 80303 USA; [Mitrovica, Jerry X.] Harvard Univ, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Williams, Carlie] Univ S Florida, Coll Marine Sci, St Petersburg, FL 33701 USA","Wickert, AD (reprint author), Univ Colorado, Inst Arctic & Alpine Res, 1560 30th St, Boulder, CO 80303 USA.",wickert@colorado.edu,"Wickert, Andrew/C-2021-2014","Wickert, Andrew/0000-0002-9545-3365",US Department of Defense through the National Defense Science and Engineering Graduate Fellowship Program; US National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship [DGE 1144083]; Canadian Institute for Advanced Research; Harvard University,"We thank F.

It has been suggested that the C, N and P cycles could become uncoupled under rapid climate change because of the different degrees of control exerted on the supply of these elements by biological and geochemical processes(1-5). Climatic controls on biogeochemical cycles are particularly relevant in arid, semi-arid and dry sub-humid ecosystems (drylands) because their biological activity is mainly driven by water availability(6-8). The increase in aridity predicted for the twenty-first century in many drylands worldwide(9-11) may therefore threaten the balance between these cycles, differentially affecting the availability of essential nutrients(12-14). Here we evaluate how aridity affects the balance between C, N and P in soils collected from 224 dryland sites from all continents except Antarctica. We find a negative effect of aridity on the concentration of soil organic C and total N, but a positive effect on the concentration of inorganic P. Aridity is negatively related to plant cover, which may favour the dominance of physical processes such as rock weathering, a major source of P to ecosystems, over biological processes that provide more C and N, such as litter decomposition(12-14). Our findings suggest that any predicted increase in aridity with climate change will probably reduce the concentrations of N and C in global drylands, but increase that of P. These changes would uncouple the C, N and P cycles in drylands and could negatively affect the provision of key services provided by these ecosystems.","[Delgado-Baquerizo, Manuel; Gallardol, Antonio] Univ Pablo Olavide, Dept Sistemas Fis Quim & Nat, Seville 41013, Spain; [Delgado-Baquerizo, Manuel; Maestre, Fernando T.; Luis Quero, Jose; Ochoa, Victoria; Gozalo, Beatriz; Garcia-Gomez, Miguel; Soliveres, Santiago; Berdugo, Miguel; Valencia, Enrique; Escolar, Cristina; Escudero, Adrian; Polo, Vicente] Univ Rey Juan Carlos, Dept Biol & Geol, Area Biodiversidad & Conservac, Escuela Super Ciencias Expt & Tecnol, Mostoles 28933, Spain; [Bowker, Matthew A.] No Arizona Univ, Sch Forestry, Flagstaff, AZ 86011 USA; [Wallenstein, Matthew D.; Garcia-Palacios, Pablo] Colorado State Univ, Nat Resource Ecol Lab, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA; [Luis Quero, Jose] Univ Cordoba, Dept Ingn Forestal, E-14071 Cordoba, Spain; [Garcia-Palacios, Pablo] Colorado State Univ, Dept Biol, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA; [Arredondo, Turin; Huber-Sannwald, Elisabeth] Inst Potosino Invest Cient Tecnol, Div Ciencias Ambientales, San Luis Potosi 78210, Mexico; [Barraza-Zepeda, Claudia; Gutierrez, Julio R.] Univ La Serena, Dept Biol, Coquimbo Region 1700000, Chile; [Bran, Donald; Gaitan, Juan] Inst Nacl Tecnol Agropecuaria, Estn Expt San Carlos Bariloche 277, RA-8400 San Carlos De Bariloche, Rio Negro, Argentina; [Antonio Carreiral, Jose] Univ Jaen, Dept Biol Anim Biol Vegetal & Ecol, Jaen 23071, Spain; [Chaieb, Mohamed; Noumi, Zouhaier] Univ Sfax, Fac Sci, Unite Rech Plant Divers & Ecosyst Arid Environm, Sfax 3018, Tunisia; [Conceicao, Abel A.; Romao, Roberto] Univ Estadual Feira de Santana, Dept Ciencias Biol, Bairro Novo Horizonte 44036, Feira De Santan, Brazil; [Derak, Mchich] Direct Reg Eaux & Forets & Lutte Desertificat Rif, Tetouan 93000, Morocco; [Eldridge, David J.] Univ New S Wales, Sch Biol Earth Environm Sci, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia; [Espinosa, Carlos I.; Guzman, Elizabeth] Univ Tecn Particular Loja, Inst Ecol, Marcelino Champagnat, Loja, Ecuador; [Gatica, M.

At present, DMSP production by corals is attributed entirely to their algal endosymbiont, Symbiodinium(2). Combining chemical, genomic and molecular approaches, we show that coral juveniles produce DMSP in the absence of algal symbionts. DMSP levels increased up to 54% over time in newly settled coral juveniles lacking algal endosymbionts, and further increases, up to 76%, were recorded when juveniles were subjected to thermal stress. We uncovered coral orthologues of two algal genes recently identified in DMSP biosynthesis, strongly indicating that corals possess the enzymatic machinery necessary for DMSP production. Our results overturn the paradigm that photosynthetic organisms are the sole biological source of DMSP, and highlight the double jeopardy represented by worldwide declining coral cover, as the potential to alleviate thermal stress through coral-produced DMSP declines correspondingly.","[Raina, Jean-Baptiste; Lutz, Adrian; Seneca, Francois O.; Willis, Bette L.] James Cook Univ, AIMS JCU, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; [Raina, Jean-Baptiste; Seneca, Francois O.; Willis, Bette L.] James Cook Univ, Sch Marine & Trop Biol, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; [Raina, Jean-Baptiste; Tapiolas, Dianne M.; Lutz, Adrian; Abrego, David; Seneca, Francois O.; Bourne, David G.; Motti, Cherie A.] Australian Inst Marine Sci, Townsville, Qld 4810, Australia; [Raina, Jean-Baptiste; Foret, Sylvain; Lutz, Adrian; Willis, Bette L.] James Cook Univ, Sch Marine & Trop Biol, ARC Ctr Excellence Coral Reef Studies, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; [Foret, Sylvain] Australian Natl Univ, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia; [Lutz, Adrian] James Cook Univ, Sch Pharm & Mol Sci, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; [Ceh, Janja] Murdoch Univ, Sch Biol Sci & Biotechnol, Perth, WA 6050, Australia; [Clode, Peta L.] Univ Western Australia, Ctr Microscopy Characterisat & Anal, Crawley, WA 6009, Australia; [Clode, Peta L.] Univ Western Australia, Oceans Inst, Crawley, WA 6009, Australia","Raina, JB (reprint author), James Cook Univ, AIMS JCU, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia.",j.raina@aims.gov.au,"Clode, Peta/C-4482-2011; Motti, Cherie/A-2588-2012; FORET, Sylvain/B-9207-2012; Lutz, Adrian/O-9805-2016; Bourne, David/B-5073-2008","Lutz, Adrian/0000-0002-8392-3921; Bourne, David/0000-0002-1492-8710; Seneca, Francois/0000-0002-8908-1227; Motti, Cherie/0000-0002-3292-2785; Raina, Jean-Baptiste/0000-0002-7508-0004","AMMRF Centre for Microscopy, Characterisation and Analysis (UWA); ARC Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies; AIMS","The authors would like to thank D.

Although the need for both iron(II) and iron(III) is clear, little is known about the biological mechanisms controlling their ratio(1). Here we present the structure of the magnetosome-associated protein MamP and find that it is built on a unique arrangement of a self-plugged PDZ domain fused to two magnetochrome domains, defining a new class of c-type cytochrome exclusively found in magnetotactic bacteria. Mutational analysis, enzyme kinetics, co-crystallization with iron(II) and an in vitro MamP-assisted magnetite production assay establish MamP as an iron oxidase that contributes to the formation of iron(III) ferrihydrite eventually required for magnetite crystal growth in vivo. These results demonstrate the molecular mechanisms of iron management taking place inside the magnetosome and highlight the role of magnetochrome in iron biomineralization.","[Siponen, Marina I.; Arnoux, Pascal; Pignol, David] Commissariat Energie Atom & Energies Alternat, Direct Sci Vivant, Inst Biol Environm & Biotechnol, Lab Bioenerget Cellulaire, F-13108 St Paul Les Durance, France; [Siponen, Marina I.; Arnoux, Pascal; Pignol, David] CNRS, Unite Mixte Rech Biol Vegetaleet Microbiol Enviro, F-13108 St Paul Les Durance, France; [Siponen, Marina I.; Arnoux, Pascal; Pignol, David] Aix Marseille Univ, F-13108 St Paul Les Durance, France; [Legrand, Pierre] Synchrotron SOLEIL, F-91192 Gif Sur Yvette, France; [Widdrat, Marc; Faivre, Damien] Max Planck Inst Colloids & Interfaces, Dept Biomat, D-14424 Potsdam, Germany; [Jones, Stephanie R.; Chang, Michelle C.

At the viscosity of water, the kinetics of unimolecular reactions are described by diffusion of a Brownian particle over a free-energy barrier separating reactants and products. For reactions in solution this famous theory extended Eyring's transition state theory, and is widely applied in physics, chemistry and biology, including to reactions as complex as protein folding(3,4). Because the diffusion coefficient of Kramers' theory is determined by the dynamics in the sparsely populated region of the barrier top, its properties have not been directly measured for any molecular system. Here we show that the Kramers diffusion coefficient and free-energy barrier can be characterized by measuring the temperature- and viscosity-dependence of the transition path time for protein folding. The transition path is the small fraction of an equilibrium trajectory for a single molecule when the free-energy barrier separating two states is actually crossed. Its duration, the transition path time, can now be determined from photon trajectories for single protein molecules undergoing folding/unfolding transitions(5). Our finding of a long transition path time with an unusually small solvent viscosity dependence suggests that internal friction as well as solvent friction determine the Kramers diffusion coefficient for alpha-helical proteins, as opposed to a breakdown of his theory, which occurs for many small-molecule reactions(2). It is noteworthy that the new and fundamental information concerning Kramers' theory and the dynamics of barrier crossings obtained here come from experiments on a protein rather than a much simpler chemical or physical system.","[Chung, Hoi Sung; Eaton, William A.] NIDDK, Chem Phys Lab, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA","Chung, HS (reprint author), NIDDK, Chem Phys Lab, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA.",chunghoi@niddk.nih.gov; eaton@helix.nih.gov,"Chung, Hoi Sung/C-2624-2009","Chung, Hoi Sung/0000-0001-6897-4969","Intramural Research Program of the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, National Institutes of Health","We are particularly indebted to J.

Circadian clocks comprise transcription-translation feedback loops, which are entrained by environmental signals such as light and temperature to adjust the phase of rhythms to match the local environment(3). The production of sugars by photosynthesis is a key metabolic output of the circadian clock in plants(2,5). Here we show that these rhythmic, endogenous sugar signals can entrain circadian rhythms in Arabidopsis thaliana by regulating the gene expression of circadian clock components early in the photoperiod, thus defining a 'metabolic dawn'. By inhibiting photosynthesis, we demonstrate that endogenous oscillations in sugar levels provide metabolic feedback to the circadian oscillator through the morning-expressed gene PSEUDO-RESPONSE REGULATOR 7 (PRR7), and we identify that prr7 mutants are insensitive to the effects of sucrose on the circadian period. Thus, photosynthesis has a marked effect on the entrainment and maintenance of robust circadian rhythms in A. thaliana, demonstrating that metabolism has a crucial role in regulation of the circadian clock.","[Haydon, Michael J.; Mielczarek, Olga; Robertson, Fiona C.; Hubbard, Katharine E.; Webb, Alex A.

The pathway involves the partial oxidation and splitting of sugars to pyruvate, which in turn is decarboxylated to produce acetyl-coenzyme A (CoA) for various biosynthetic purposes. The decarboxylation of pyruvate loses a carbon equivalent, and limits the theoretical carbon yield to only two moles of two-carbon (C2) metabolites per mole of hexose. This native route is a major source of carbon loss in biorefining and microbial carbon metabolism. Here we design and construct a non-oxidative, cyclic pathway that allows the production of stoichiometric amounts of C2 metabolites from hexose, pentose and triose phosphates without carbon loss. We tested this pathway, termed non-oxidative glycolysis (NOG), in vitro and in vivo in Escherichia coli. NOG enables complete carbon conservation in sugar catabolism to acetyl-CoA, and can be used in conjunction with CO2 fixation(1) and other one-carbon (C1) assimilation pathways(2) to achieve a 100% carbon yield to desirable fuels and chemicals.","[Bogorad, Igor W.; Lin, Tzu-Shyang; Liao, James C.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Chem & Biomol Engn, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Bogorad, Igor W.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Bioengn, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Liao, James C.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Inst Genom & Prote, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA","Liao, JC (reprint author), Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Chem & Biomol Engn, 420 Westwood Plaza, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.",liaoj@ucla.edu,,,National Science Foundation (NSF) [MCB-1139318]; Department of Energy (DOE) [DE0-SC0006698]; NSF Integrative Graduate Education and Research Traineeship (IGERT) [0903720],This work was partially supported by National Science Foundation (NSF) grant MCB-1139318 and Department of Energy (DOE) grant DE0-SC0006698.

We and others(2) are developing computation-guided strategies for functional discovery with 'metabolite docking' to experimentally derived(3) or homology-based(4) three-dimensional structures. Bacterial metabolic pathways often are encoded by 'genome neighbourhoods' (gene clusters and/or operons), which can provide important clues for functional assignment. We recently demonstrated the synergy of docking and pathway context by 'predicting' the intermediates in the glycolytic pathway in Escherichia coli(5). Metabolite docking to multiple binding proteins and enzymes in the same pathway increases the reliability of in silico predictions of substrate specificities because the pathway intermediates are structurally similar. Here we report that structure-guided approaches for predicting the substrate specificities of several enzymes encoded by a bacterial gene cluster allowed the correct prediction of the in vitro activity of a structurally characterized enzyme of unknown function (PDB 2PMQ), 2-epimerization of trans-4-hydroxy-L-proline betaine (tHyp-B) and cis-4-hydroxy-D-proline betaine (cHyp-B), and also the correct identification of the catabolic pathway in which Hyp-B 2-epimerase participates. The substrate-liganded pose predicted by virtual library screening (docking) was confirmed experimentally. The enzymatic activities in the predicted pathway were confirmed by in vitro assays and genetic analyses; the intermediates were identified by metabolomics; and repression of the genes encoding the pathway by high salt concentrations was established by transcriptomics, confirming the osmolyte role of tHyp-B. This study establishes the utility of structure-guided functional predictions to enable the discovery of new metabolic pathways.","[Zhao, Suwen; Jacobson, Matthew P.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Pharmaceut Chem, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; [Kumar, Ritesh; Sakai, Ayano; Wood, B.

Despite this requirement for crossovers and an excess of the double-strand DNA breaks that are the initiating events for meiotic recombination, most organisms make very few crossovers per chromosome pair(2). Moreover, crossovers tend to inhibit the formation of other crossovers nearby on the same chromosome pair, a poorly understood phenomenon known as crossover interference(3,4). Here we show that the synaptonemal complex, a meiosis-specific structure that assembles between aligned homologous chromosomes, both constrains and is altered by crossover recombination events. Using a cytological marker of crossover sites in Caenorhabditis elegans(5), we show that partial depletion of the synaptonemal complex central region proteins attenuates crossover interference, increasing crossovers and reducing the effective distance over which interference operates, indicating that synaptonemal complex proteins limit crossovers. Moreover, we show that crossovers are associated with a local 0.4-0.5-micrometre increase in chromosome axis length. We propose that meiotic crossover regulation operates as a self-limiting system in which meiotic chromosome structures establish an environment that promotes crossover formation, which in turn alters chromosome structure to inhibit other crossovers at additional sites.","[Libuda, Diana E.; Villeneuve, Anne M.] Stanford Univ, Dept Dev Biol, Sch Med, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Uzawa, Satoru; Meyer, Barbara J.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Uzawa, Satoru; Meyer, Barbara J.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mol & Cell Biol, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Villeneuve, Anne M.] Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Dept Genet, Stanford, CA 94305 USA","Villeneuve, AM (reprint author), Stanford Univ, Dept Dev Biol, Sch Med, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",annev@stanford.edu,,,"National Institutes of Health (NIH) [P40 OD010440, K99 HD076165, R01 GM067268]; Helen Hay Whitney Foundation; Katharine McCormick Advanced Postdoctoral Fellowship","We thank A.

These bacteria began to convert solar energy and carbon dioxide into bioenergy and oxygen more than two billion years ago. Cyanophages, which infect these bacteria, have an important role in regulating the marine ecosystem by controlling cyanobacteria community organization and mediating lateral gene transfer. Here we visualize the maturation process of cyanophage Syn5 inside its host cell, Synechococcus, using Zernike phase contrast electron cryo-tomography (cryoET)(1,2). This imaging modality yields dramatic enhancement of image contrast over conventional cryoET and thus facilitates the direct identification of subcellular components, including thylakoid membranes, carboxysomes and polyribosomes, as well as phages, inside the congested cytosol of the infected cell. By correlating the structural features and relative abundance of viral progeny within cells at different stages of infection, we identify distinct Syn5 assembly intermediates. Our results indicate that the procapsid releases scaffolding proteins and expands its volume at an early stage of genome packaging. Later in the assembly process, we detected full particles with a tail either with or without an additional horn. The morphogenetic pathway we describe here is highly conserved and was probably established long before that of double-stranded DNA viruses infecting more complex organisms.","[Dai, Wei; Fu, Caroline; Flanagan, John; Khant, Htet A.; Liu, Xiangan; Rochat, Ryan H.; Ludtke, Steve J.; Schmid, Michael F.; Chiu, Wah] Baylor Coll Med, Verna & Marrs Mclean Dept Biochem & Mol Biol, Natl Ctr Macromol Imaging, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Raytcheva, Desislava; Haase-Pettingell, Cameron; King, Jonathan A.] MIT, Dept Biol, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Raytcheva, Desislava; Piret, Jacqueline] Northeastern Univ, Dept Biol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Rochat, Ryan H.; Ludtke, Steve J.; Schmid, Michael F.; Chiu, Wah] Baylor Coll Med, Program Struct & Computat Biol & Mol Biophys, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Nagayama, Kuniaki] Natl Inst Nat Sci, Natl Inst Physiol Sci, Okazaki, Aichi 4448787, Japan","Chiu, W (reprint author), Baylor Coll Med, Verna & Marrs Mclean Dept Biochem & Mol Biol, Natl Ctr Macromol Imaging, Houston, TX 77030 USA.",wah@bcm.edu,,,"Robert Welch Foundation [Q1242]; National Institutes of Health [P41GM123832, AI0175208, PN2EY016525, GM080139]; National Institutes of Health through the Gulf Coast Consortia [T15LM007093]; National Institutes of Health through the MSTP [T32GM007330]",This research was supported by grants from the Robert Welch Foundation (Q1242) and National Institutes of Health (P41GM123832 to W.C.; AI0175208 and PN2EY016525 to W.C. and J.A.K.; GM080139 to S.J.L.; T15LM007093 through the Gulf Coast Consortia to W.D. and R.H.R.; T32GM007330 through the MSTP to R.H.R.).

We used a computational structure-activity screen of >400,000 compounds that identified >100 natural compounds as candidate repellents. We tested several and found that most activate Ir40a(+) neurons and are repellents for Drosophila. These compounds are also strong repellents for mosquitoes. The candidates contain chemicals that do not dissolve plastic, are affordable and smell mildly like grapes, with three considered safe in human foods.

To test this hypothesis, here we use the mouse hair follicle niche and combine intravital microscopy with genetic lineage tracing to re-visit the same stem-cell lineages, from their exact place of origin, throughout regeneration in live mice. Using this method, we show directly that the position of a stem cell within the hair follicle niche can predict whether it is likely to remain uncommitted, generate precursors or commit to a differentiated fate. Furthermore, using laser ablation we demonstrate that hair follicle stem cells are dispensable for regeneration, and that epithelial cells, which do not normally participate in hair growth, re-populate the lost stem-cell compartment and sustain hair regeneration.

Two methylation guide sequences are combined on each guide RNA, the significance of which has remained unclear. Here we use a powerful combination of NMR spectroscopy and small-angle neutron scattering to solve the structure of the 390 kDa archaeal RNP enzyme bound to substrate RNA. We show that the two methylation guide sequences are located in different environments in the complex and that the methylation of physiological substrates targeted by the same guide RNA occurs sequentially.

The small fraction of confirmed galaxies may indicate that the neutral fraction in the intergalactic medium rises quickly at z > 6.5, given that Lyman alpha is resonantly scattered by neutral gas(3,5-8). The small samples and limited depth of previous observations, however, makes these conclusions tentative. Here we report a deep near-infrared spectroscopic survey of 43 photometrically-selected galaxies with z > 6.5. We detect a near-infrared emission line from only a single galaxy, confirming that some process is making Lyman alpha difficult to detect. The detected emission line at a wavelength of 1.0343 micrometres is likely to be Lyman alpha emission, placing this galaxy at a redshift z = 7.51, an epoch 700 million years after the Big Bang. This galaxy's colours are consistent with significant metal content, implying that galaxies become enriched rapidly. We calculate a surprisingly high star-formation rate of about 330 solar masses per year, which is more than a factor of 100 greater than that seen in the Milky Way. Such a galaxy is unexpected in a survey of our size(9), suggesting that the early Universe may harbour a larger number of intense sites of star formation than expected.","[Finkelstein, S.

We chose the conducting LaAlO3-SrTiO3 interface(2) as the 2D superconductor, because this electron system can be tuned continuously with an electric gate field(3). We observed an energy gap of the order of 40 micro-electronvolts in the density of states, whose shape is well described by the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer superconducting gap function. In contrast to the dome-shaped dependence of the critical temperature, the gap increases with charge carrier depletion in both the underdoped region and the overdoped region. These results are analogous to the pseudogap behaviour of the high-transition-temperature copper oxide superconductors and imply that the smooth continuation of the superconducting gap into pseudogap-like behaviour could be a general property of 2D superconductivity.","[Richter, C.; Boschker, H.; Dietsche, W.; Fillis-Tsirakis, E.; Mannhart, J.] Max Planck Inst Solid State Res, D-70569 Stuttgart, Germany; [Richter, C.; Jany, R.; Loder, F.] Univ Augsburg, Ctr Elect Correlat & Magnetism, D-86135 Augsburg, Germany; [Kourkoutis, L.

Appropriate systems such as BaxSr1-xTiO3 have a paraelectric-ferroelectric transition just below ambient temperature, providing high tunability(1-3). Unfortunately, such films suffer significant losses arising from defects. Recognizing that progress is stymied by dielectric loss, we start with a system with exceptionally low loss-Srn+1TinO3n+1 phases(4,5)-in which (SrO)(2) crystallographic shear(6,7) planes provide an alternative to the formation of point defects for accommodating non-stoichiometry(8,9). Here we report the experimental realization of a highly tunable ground state arising from the emergence of a local ferroelectric instability(10) in biaxially strained Srn+1TinO3n+1 phases with n >= 3 at frequencies up to 125 GHz. In contrast to traditional methods of modifying ferroelectrics-doping(1-3,11,12) or strain(13-16)-in this unique system an increase in the separation between the (SrO)(2) planes, which can be achieved by changing n, bolsters the local ferroelectric instability. This new control parameter, n, can be exploited to achieve a figure of merit at room temperature that rivals all known tunable microwave dielectrics(3).","[Lee, Che-Hui; Nie, Yuefeng; Zhang, Jingshu; Schlom, Darrell G.] Cornell Univ, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Lee, Che-Hui; Haislmaier, Ryan; Vlahos, Eftihia; Gopalan, Venkatraman] Penn State Univ, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Orloff, Nathan D.; Booth, James C.] NIST, Boulder, CO 80305 USA; [Orloff, Nathan D.] Univ Maryland, Dept Phys, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Birol, Turan; Zhu, Ye; Mundy, Julia A.; Kourkoutis, Lena F.; Kim, Yongsam; Brock, Joel D.; Muller, David A.; Fennie, Craig J.] Cornell Univ, Sch Appl & Engn Phys, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Goian, Veronica; Nuzhnyy, Dmitry; Kamba, Stanislav] Inst Phys ASCR, Prague 18221 8, Czech Republic; [Rocas, Eduard] Univ Politecn Cataluna, Dept Signal Theory & Commun, ES-08034 Barcelona, Spain; [Kourkoutis, Lena F.; Muller, David A.; Schlom, Darrell G.] Kavli Inst Cornell Nanoscale Sci, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Biegalski, Michael D.] Oak Ridge Natl Lab, Ctr Nanophase Mat Sci, Oak Ridge, TN 37831 USA; [Bernhagen, Margitta; Uecker, Reinhard] Leibniz Inst Crystal Growth, D-12489 Berlin, Germany; [Benedek, Nicole A.] Univ Texas Austin, Mat Sci & Engn Program, Austin, TX 78712 USA; [Xi, X.

Consequently, much effort is invested in optimizing the design of catalytic reactors, usually by modelling(4) the coupling between heat transfer, fluid dynamics and surface reactionkinetics. The complexity involved requires a calibration of model approximations against experimental observations(5,6), with temperature maps being particularly valuable because temperature control is often essential for optimal operation and because temperature gradients contain information about the energetics of a reaction. However, it is challenging to probe the behaviour of a gas inside a reactor without disturbing its flow, particularly when trying also to map the physical parameters and gradients that dictate heat and mass flow and catalytic efficiency(1-9). Although optical techniques(10-12) and sensors(13,14) have been used for that purpose, the former perform poorly in opaque media and the latter perturb the flow. NMR thermometry can measure temperature non-invasively, but traditional approaches applied to gases produce signals that depend only weakly on temperature(15,16) are rapidly attenuated by diffusion(16,17) or require contrast agents(18) that may interfere with reactions. Here we present a new NMR thermometry technique that circumvents these problems by exploiting the inverse relationship between NMR line-widths and temperature caused by motional averaging in a weak magnetic field gradient. We demonstrate the concept by non-invasively mapping gas temperatures during the hydrogenation of propylene in reactors packed with metal nanoparticles and metal-organic framework catalysts, with measurement errors of less than four per cent of the absolute temperature. These results establish our technique as a non-invasive tool for locating hot and cold spots in catalyst-packed gas-solid reactors, with unprecedented capabilities for testing the approximations used in reactor modelling.","[Jarenwattananon, Nanette N.; Gloeggler, Stefan; Otto, Trenton; Melkonian, Arek; Morris, William; Yaghi, Omar M.; Bouchard, Louis-S.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Chem & Biochem, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Burt, Scott R.] Brigham Young Univ, Dept Chem & Biochem, Provo, UT 84602 USA; [Yaghi, Omar M.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Chem, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Yaghi, Omar M.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Div Mat Sci, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Yaghi, Omar M.] NanoCentury KAIST Inst, Taejon 305701, South Korea; [Yaghi, Omar M.] World Class Univ, Grad Sch Energy Environm Water & Sustainabil, Taejon 305701, South Korea; [Bouchard, Louis-S.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Calif NanoSyst Inst, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Bouchard, Louis-S.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Bioengn, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA","Bouchard, LS (reprint author), Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Chem & Biochem, 607 Charles E Young Dr East, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.",bouchard@chem.ucla.edu,,"Yaghi, Omar/0000-0002-5611-3325","Dreyfus New Faculty Award; Beckman Young Investigator Award; US NSF [CHE-1153159]; BASF, Germany (synthesis); US DOE","We thank J.

Given that further human-forced changes in the Earth's climate system seem inevitable(9,10), the possibility exists that the character of ENSO and its impacts might change over the coming century. Although this issue has been investigated many times during the past 20 years, there is very little consensus on future changes in ENSO, apart from an expectation that ENSO will continue to be a dominant source of year-to-year variability(9,11,12). Here we show that there are in fact robust projected changes in the spatial patterns of year-to-year ENSO-driven variability in both surface temperature and precipitation. These changes are evident in the two most recent generations of climate models(13,14), using four different scenarios for CO2 and other radiatively active gases(14-17). By the mid- to late twenty-first century, the projections include an intensification of both El-Nino-driven drying in the western Pacific Ocean and rainfall increases in the central and eastern equatorial Pacific. Experiments with an Atmospheric General Circulation Model reveal that robust projected changes in precipitation anomalies during El Nino years are primarily determined by a nonlinear response to surface global warming. Uncertain projected changes in the amplitude of ENSO-driven surface temperature variability have only a secondary role. Projected changes in key characteristics of ENSO are consequently much clearer than previously realized.","[Power, Scott; Delage, Francois; Chung, Christine; Kociuba, Greg; Keay, Kevin] Bur Meteorol, Ctr Australian Weather & Climate Res, Melbourne, Vic 3008, Australia","Power, S (reprint author), Bur Meteorol, Ctr Australian Weather & Climate Res, Melbourne, Vic 3008, Australia.",s.power@bom.gov.au,,,"Australian Climate Change Science Program (ACCSP); Pacific-Australia Climate Change Science and Adaptation planning Program (PACCSAP); AusAID; Department of Industry, Innovation, Climate Change, Science, Research and Tertiary Education","We thank L.

However, these propositions have been based on evidence from derived euconodonts. Here we test hypotheses of a paraconodont ancestry of euconodonts(7-11) using synchrotron radiation X-ray tomographic microscopy to characterize and compare the microstructure of morphologically similar euconodont and paraconodont elements. Paraconodonts exhibit a range of grades of structural differentiation, including tissues and a pattern of growth common to euconodont basal bodies. The different grades of structural differentiation exhibited by paraconodonts demonstrate the stepwise acquisition of euconodont characters, resolving debate over the relationship between these two groups. By implication, the putative homology of euconodont crown tissue and vertebrate enamel must be rejected as these tissues have evolved independently and convergently. Thus, the precise ontogenetic, structural and topological similarities between conodont elements and vertebrate odontodes appear to be a remarkable instance of convergence. The last common ancestor of conodonts and jawed vertebrates probably lacked mineralized skeletal tissues. The hypothesis that teeth evolved before jaws and the inside-out hypothesis of dental evolution must be rejected; teeth seem to have evolved through the extension of odontogenic competence from the external dermis to internal epithelium soon after the origin of jaws.","[Murdock, Duncan J.

In mice, this program follows a circadian rhythm that peaks with nocturnal feeding(1,2) and is repressed by Rev-erb alpha/beta and an HDAC3-containing complex(3-5) during the day. The transcriptional activators controlling rhythmic lipid synthesis in the dark cycle remain poorly defined. Disturbances in hepatic lipogenesis are also associated with systemic metabolic phenotypes(6-8), suggesting that lipogenesis in the liver communicates with peripheral tissues to control energy substrate homeostasis. Here we identify a PPAR delta-dependent de novo lipogenic pathway in the liver that modulates fat use by muscle via a circulating lipid. The nuclear receptor PPAR delta controls diurnal expression of lipogenic genes in the dark/feeding cycle. Liver-specific PPAR delta activation increases, whereas hepatocyte-Ppard deletion reduces, muscle fatty acid uptake. Unbiased metabolite profiling identifies phosphatidylcholine 18:0/18:1 (PC(18:0/18:1) as a serum lipid regulated by diurnal hepatic PPAR delta activity. PC(18:0/18:1) reduces postprandial lipid levels and increases fatty acid use through muscle PPAR alpha. High-fat feeding diminishes rhythmic production of PC(18:0/18:1), whereas PC(18:0/18:1) administration in db/db mice (also known as Lepr(-/-)) improves metabolic homeostasis. These findings reveal an integrated regulatory circuit coupling lipid synthesis in the liver to energy use in muscle by coordinating the activity of two closely related nuclear receptors.

CLAVATA signalling involves a secreted peptide, CLAVATA3 (CLV3)(2), and its perception by cell surface leucine-rich repeat (LRR) receptors, including the CLV1 receptor kinase(3) and a LRR receptor-like protein, CLV2 (ref. 4). However, the signalling mechanisms downstream of these receptors are poorly understood, especially for LRR receptor-like proteins, which lack a signalling domain(5). Here we show that maize COMPACT PLANT2 (CT2) encodes the predicted alpha-subunit (G alpha) of a heterotrimeric GTP binding protein. Maize ct2 phenotypes resemble Arabidopsis thaliana clavata mutants, and genetic, biochemical and functional assays indicate that CT2/G alpha transmits a stem-cell-restrictive signal from a CLAVATA LRR receptor, suggesting a new function for G alpha signalling in plants. Heterotrimeric GTP-binding proteins are membrane-associated molecular switches that are commonly activated by ligand binding to an associated seven-pass transmembrane (7TM) G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR)(6). Recent studies have questioned the idea that plant heterotrimeric G proteins interact with canonical GPCRs(7), and our findings suggest that single pass transmembrane receptors act as GPCRs in plants, challenging the dogma that GPCRs are exclusively 7TM proteins.","[Bommert, Peter; Il Je, Byoung; Goldshmidt, Alexander; Jackson, David] Cold Spring Harbor Lab, Cold Spring Harbor, NY 11724 USA","Jackson, D (reprint author), Cold Spring Harbor Lab, POB 100, Cold Spring Harbor, NY 11724 USA.",jacksond@cshl.edu,,,DFG [Bo 3012/1-1]; BARD [FI-431-2008]; Dupont-Pioneer; National Science Foundation [DBI-0604923],"The authors thank T.

For the pathogenic retrovirus human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), these include widely expressed restriction factors(1), such as APOBEC3 proteins(2), TRIM5-alpha(3), BST2 (refs 4, 5) and SAMHD1 (refs 6, 7), as well as additional factors that are stimulated by type 1 interferon (IFN)(8-14). Here we use both ectopic expression and gene-silencing experiments to define the human dynamin-like, IFN-induced myxovirus resistance 2 (MX2, also known as MXB) protein as a potent inhibitor of HIV-1 infection and as a key effector of IFN-alpha-mediated resistance to HIV-1 infection. MX2 suppresses infection by all HIV-1 strains tested, has equivalent or reduced effects on divergent simian immunodeficiency viruses, and does not inhibit other retroviruses such as murine leukaemia virus. The Capsid region of the viral Gag protein dictates susceptibility to MX2, and the block to infection occurs at a late post-entry step, with both the nuclear accumulation and chromosomal integration of nascent viral complementary DNA suppressed. Finally, human MX1 (also known as MXA), a closely related protein that has long been recognized as a broadly acting inhibitor of RNA and DNA viruses, including the orthomyxovirus influenza A virus(15,16), does not affect HIV-1, whereas MX2 is ineffective against influenza virus. MX2 is therefore a cell-autonomous, anti-HIV-1 resistance factor whose purposeful mobilization may represent a new therapeutic approach for the treatment of HIV/AIDS.","[Goujon, Caroline; Bauby, Helene; Doyle, Tomas; Ward, Christopher C.; Schaller, Torsten; Malim, Michael H.] Kings Coll London, Dept Infect Dis, London SE1 9RT, England; [Moncorge, Olivier; Barclay, Wendy S.] Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Div Infect Dis, Virol Sect, London W2 1PG, England; [Hue, Stephane] UCL, Div Infect & Immun, Ctr Med Mol Virol, London WC1 6RT, England; [Schulz, Reiner] Kings Coll London, Dept Med & Mol Genet, London SE1 9RT, England","Malim, MH (reprint author), Kings Coll London, Dept Infect Dis, London SE1 9RT, England.",michael.malim@kcl.ac.uk,"Goujon, Caroline/B-3914-2014; Bauby, Helene/C-8965-2014; Schulz, Reiner/A-5940-2011; Moncorge, Olivier/E-3233-2017","Goujon, Caroline/0000-0002-7682-5725; Bauby, Helene/0000-0003-1419-7652; Schulz, Reiner/0000-0001-5047-7921; Moncorge, Olivier/0000-0003-0512-1824; Hue, Stephane/0000-0002-8580-6905; Schaller, Torsten/0000-0001-9597-4112; Malim, Michael/0000-0002-7699-2064",UK Medical Research Council; National Institutes of Health [DA033773]; European Commission [PIEF-GA-2009-237501]; Wellcome Trust; Department of Health via a National Institute for Health Research comprehensive Biomedical Research Centre; King's College London; King's College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust,"We wish to thank L.

However, none of the known antiretroviral proteins can account for the ability of type I IFN to inhibit early, preintegration phases of the HIV-1 replication cycle in human cells(3,4). Here, by comparing gene expression profiles in cell lines that differ in their ability to support the inhibitory action of IFN-alpha at early steps of the HIV-1 replication cycle, we identify myxovirus resistance 2 (MX2) as an interferon-induced inhibitor of HIV-1 infection. Expression of MX2 reduces permissiveness to a variety of lentiviruses, whereas depletion of MX2 using RNA interference reduces the anti-HIV-1 potency of IFN-alpha. HIV-1 reverse transcription proceeds normally in MX2-expressing cells, but 2-long terminal repeat circular forms of HIV-1 DNA are less abundant, suggesting that MX2 inhibits HIV-1 nuclear import, or destabilizes nuclear HIV-1 DNA. Consistent with this notion, mutations in the HIV-1 capsid protein that are known, or suspected, to alter the nuclear import pathways used by HIV-1 confer resistance to MX2, whereas preventing cell division increases MX2 potency. Overall, these findings indicate that MX2 is an effector of the anti-HIV-1 activity of type-I IFN, and suggest that MX2 inhibits HIV-1 infection by inhibiting capsid-dependent nuclear import of subviral complexes.","[Kane, Melissa; Yadav, Shalini S.; Bitzegeio, Julia; Kutluay, Sebla B.; Zang, Trinity; Wilson, Sam J.; Yamashita, Masahiro; Hatziioannou, Theodora; Bieniasz, Paul D.] Aaron Diamond AIDS Res Ctr, New York, NY 10016 USA; [Kane, Melissa; Yadav, Shalini S.; Bitzegeio, Julia; Kutluay, Sebla B.; Zang, Trinity; Wilson, Sam J.; Bieniasz, Paul D.] Rockefeller Univ, Lab Retrovirol, New York, NY 10065 USA; [Yadav, Shalini S.; Zang, Trinity; Wilson, Sam J.; Bieniasz, Paul D.] Howard Hughes Med Inst, New York, NY 10016 USA; [Schoggins, John W.; Rice, Charles M.] Rockefeller Univ, Ctr Study Hepatitis C, New York, NY 10065 USA","Bieniasz, PD (reprint author), Aaron Diamond AIDS Res Ctr, New York, NY 10016 USA.",pbienias@adarc.org,,"Wilson, Sam/0000-0002-6065-0895","National Institutes of Health [R37AI64003, R01AI078788, R01AI100720, AI091707, AI057158, DK095031]; Greenberg Medical Research Institute; Starr Foundation; Howard Hughes Medical Institute","We thank members of The Rockefeller University Genomics Resource Center for assistance with the microarray experiments and members of the Bieniasz laboratory for discussion and advice.

This subset of stable microtubules accumulates in cell protrusions(2) and regulates cell polarization(3), migration and invasion(4-7). However, mechanisms restricting acetylation to these microtubules are unknown. Here we report that clathrin-coated pits (CCPs) control microtubule acetylation through a direct interaction of the alpha-tubulin acetyltransferase alpha TAT1 (refs 8, 9) with the clathrin adaptor AP2. We observe that about one-third of growing microtubule ends contact and pause at CCPs and that loss of CCPs decreases lysine 40 acetylation levels. We show that alpha TAT1 localizes to CCPs through a direct interaction with AP2 that is required for microtubule acetylation. In migrating cells, the polarized orientation of acetylated microtubules correlates with CCP accumulation at the leading edge(10), and interaction of alpha TAT1 with AP2 is required for directional migration. We conclude that microtubules contacting CCPs become acetylated by alpha TAT1. In migrating cells, this mechanism ensures the acetylation of microtubules oriented towards the leading edge, thus promoting directional cell locomotion and chemotaxis.","[Montagnac, Guillaume; Irondelle, Marie; Castro-Castro, Antonio; Chavrier, Philippe] Inst Curie, Res Ctr, F-75005 Paris, France; [Montagnac, Guillaume; Irondelle, Marie; Castro-Castro, Antonio; Chavrier, Philippe] CNRS, UMR 144, F-75005 Paris, France; [Meas-Yedid, Vannary; Olivo-Marin, Jean-Christophe] Inst Pasteur, CNRS, URA 2582, Unite Anal Images Quantitat, F-75015 Paris, France; [Franco, Michel] Univ Nice Sophia Antipolis, CNRS, UMR 6097, Inst Pharmacol Mol & Cellulaire, F-06560 Valbonne, France; [Shida, Toshinobu; Nachury, Maxence V.] Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Dept Mol & Cellular Physiol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Benmerah, Alexandre] Hop Necker Enfants Malad, INSERM, U983, F-75015 Paris, France; [Benmerah, Alexandre] Univ Paris 05, Sorbonne Paris Cite, Inst Imagine, F-75015 Paris, France","Montagnac, G (reprint author), Inst Curie, Res Ctr, F-75005 Paris, France.",guillaume.montagnac@curie.fr; philippe.chavrier@curie.fr,"Nachury, Maxence/A-8759-2008; CHAVRIER, Philippe/B-4707-2010; benmerah, alexandre/H-3742-2017","Nachury, Maxence/0000-0003-4918-1562; CHAVRIER, Philippe/0000-0002-7351-733X; benmerah, alexandre/0000-0003-0188-8016",Institut Curie; CNRS; Fondation ARC pour la Recherche contre le Cancer [SL220100601356]; Institut National du Cancer [2009-1-PL BIO-12-IC-1],The authors wish to thank P.

Although microbial production of diesel has been reported, production of another much in demand transport fuel, petrol (gasoline), has not yet been demonstrated. Here we report the development of platform Escherichia coli strains that are capable of producing short-chain alkanes (SCAs; petrol), free fatty acids (FFAs), fatty esters and fatty alcohols through the fatty acyl (acyl carrier protein (ACP)) to fatty acid to fatty acyl-CoA pathway. First, the beta-oxidation pathway was blocked by deleting the fadE gene to prevent the degradation of fatty acyl-CoAs generated in vivo. To increase the formation of short-chain fatty acids suitable for subsequent conversion to SCAs in vivo, the activity of 3-oxoacyl-ACP synthase (FabH)(1), which is inhibited by unsaturated fatty acyl-ACPs(2), was enhanced to promote the initiation of fatty acid biosynthesis by deleting the fadR gene; deletion of the fadR gene prevents upregulation of the fabA and fabB genes responsible for unsaturated fatty acids biosynthesis(3). A modified thioesterase(4) was used to convert short-chain fatty acyl-ACPs to the corresponding FFAs, which were then converted to SCAs by the sequential reactions of E. coli fatty acyl-CoA synthetase, Clostridium acetobutylicum fatty acyl-CoA reductase and Arabidopsis thaliana fatty aldehyde decarbonylase. The final engineered strain produced up to 580.8 mg l(-1) of SCAs consisting of nonane (327.8 mg l(-1)), dodecane (136.5 mg l(-1)), tridecane (64.8 mg l(-1)), 2-methyl-dodecane (42.8 mg l(-1)) and tetradecane (8.9 mg l(-1)), together with small amounts of other hydrocarbons. Furthermore, this platform strain could produce short-chain FFAs using a fadD-deleted strain, and short-chain fatty esters by introducing the Acinetobacter sp. ADP1 wax ester synthase (atfA)(5) and the E. coli mutant alcohol dehydrogenase (adhE(mut))(6).","[Choi, Yong Jun; Lee, Sang Yup] Korea Adv Inst Sci & Technol, Metab & Biomol Engn Natl Res Lab, Dept Chem & Biomol Engn, BioProc Engn Res Ctr,Program BK21, Taejon 305701, South Korea; [Choi, Yong Jun; Lee, Sang Yup] Korea Adv Inst Sci & Technol, Ctr Syst & Synthet Biotechnol, Taejon 305701, South Korea; [Lee, Sang Yup] Korea Adv Inst Sci & Technol, Bioinformat & BioProc Engn Res Ctr, Taejon 305701, South Korea","Lee, SY (reprint author), Korea Adv Inst Sci & Technol, Metab & Biomol Engn Natl Res Lab, Dept Chem & Biomol Engn, BioProc Engn Res Ctr,Program BK21, 291 Daehak Ro, Taejon 305701, South Korea.",leesy@kaist.ac.kr,"Lee, Sang Yup/C-1526-2011","Lee, Sang Yup/0000-0003-0599-3091","Advanced Biomass Research and Development Center of Korea through the Global Frontier Research Program of the Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning (MSIP) through the National Research Foundation (NRF) [ABC-2010-0029799]; Technology Development Program to Solve Climate Changes on Systems Metabolic Engineering for Biorefineries by MSIP through NRF [NRF-2012-C1AAA001-2012M1A2A2026556]","We would like to thank Y.

So far, it has not been possible to capture an active-state GPCR bound to its native neurotransmitter. Crystal structures of agonist-bound GPCRs have relied on the use of either exceptionally high-affinity agonists(1,2) or receptor stabilization by mutagenesis(3-5). Many natural agonists such as adrenaline, which activates the beta(2)-adrenoceptor (beta(2)AR), bind with relatively low affinity, and they are often chemically unstable. Using directed evolution, we engineered a high-affinity camelid antibody fragment that stabilizes the active state of the beta(2)AR, and used this to obtain crystal structures of the activated receptor bound to multiple ligands. Here we present structures of the active-state human beta(2)AR bound to three chemically distinct agonists: the ultrahigh-affinity agonist BI167107, the high-affinity catecholamine agonist hydroxybenzyl isoproterenol, and the low-affinity endogenous agonist adrenaline. The crystal structures reveal a highly conserved overall ligand recognition and activation mode despite diverse ligand chemical structures and affinities that range from 100 nM to similar to 80 pM. Overall, the adrenaline-bound receptor structure is similar to the others, but it has substantial rearrangements in extracellular loop three and the extracellular tip of transmembrane helix 6. These structures also reveal a water-mediated hydrogen bond between two conserved tyrosines, which appears to stabilize the active state of the beta(2)AR and related GPCRs.","[Ring, Aaron M.; Manglik, Aashish; Kruse, Andrew C.; Enos, Michael D.; Weis, William I.; Garcia, K.

A fundamental question remains, however, as to whether the alignment of olivine crystals is uniquely produced by dislocation creep. Here we report the development of CPO in iron-free olivine (that is, forsterite) during diffusion creep; the intensity and pattern of CPO depend on temperature and the presence of melt, which control the appearance of crystallographic planes on grain boundaries. Grain boundary sliding on these crystallography-controlled boundaries accommodated by diffusion contributes to grain rotation, resulting in a CPO. We show that strong radial anisotropy is anticipated at temperatures corresponding to depths where melting initiates to depths where strongly anisotropic and low seismic velocities are detected. Conversely, weak anisotropy is anticipated at temperatures corresponding to depths where almost isotropic mantle is found. We propose diffusion creep to be the primary means of mantle flow.","[Miyazaki, Tomonori; Sueyoshi, Kenta; Hiraga, Takehiko] Univ Tokyo, Earthquake Res Inst, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo 1130032, Japan","Hiraga, T (reprint author), Univ Tokyo, Earthquake Res Inst, Bunkyo Ku, 1-1-1 Yayoi, Tokyo 1130032, Japan.",hiraga@eri.u-tokyo.ac.jp,,,"Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT), Japan; JSPS [23684043, 22000003, 21109005]; Earthquake Research Institute's cooperative research programme","Discussions with H.

To identify selective inducers of oligodendrocyte differentiation, we performed an image-based screen for myelin basic protein (MBP) expression using primary rat optic-nerve-derived progenitor cells. Here we show that among the most effective compounds identifed was benztropine, which significantly decreases clinical severity in the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) model of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis when administered alone or in combination with approved immunosuppressive treatments for multiple sclerosis. Evidence from a cuprizone-inducedmodel of demyelination, in vitro and in vivo T-cell assays and EAE adoptive transfer experiments indicated that the observed efficacy of this drug results directly from an enhancement of remyelination rather than immune suppression. Pharmacological studies indicate that benztropine functions by a mechanism that involves direct antagonism of M1 and/or M3 muscarinic receptors. These studies should facilitate the development of effective new therapies for the treatment of multiple sclerosis that complement established immunosuppressive approaches.","[Deshmukh, Vishal A.; Lyssiotis, Costas A.; Green, Chelsea C.; Swoboda, Jonathan G.; Ahmad, Insha; Schultz, Peter G.; Lairson, Luke L.] Scripps Res Inst, Dept Chem, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; [Tardif, Virginie; Theofilopoulos, Argyrios N.; Lawson, Brian R.] Scripps Res Inst, Dept Immunol & Microbial Sci, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; [Kerman, Bilal; Kim, Hyung Joon; Padmanabhan, Krishnan; Gage, Fred H.] Salk Inst Biol Sci, Lab Genet, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; [Kondo, Toru] Hokkaido Univ, Inst Med Genet, Div Stem Cell Biol, Kita Ku, Sapporo, Hokkaido 0600815, Japan; [Schultz, Peter G.; Lairson, Luke L.] Calif Inst Biomed Res, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA","Lawson, BR (reprint author), Scripps Res Inst, Dept Immunol & Microbial Sci, 10550 North Torrey Pines Rd, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA.",blawson@scripps.edu; schultz@scripps.edu; llairson@scripps.edu,,"Lairson, Luke/0000-0001-6701-996X","Skaggs Institute for Chemical Biology; California Institute for Regenerative Medicine [TR3-05617, TG2-01165]; National Science Foundation","This work was supported by the Skaggs Institute for Chemical Biology and the California Institute for Regenerative Medicine grant TR3-05617 (to P.

Here we present data and analytical results for point mutations and small insertions/deletions from 3,281 tumours across 12 tumour types as part of the TCGA Pan-Cancer effort. We illustrate the distributions of mutation frequencies, types and contexts across tumour types, and establish their links to tissues of origin, environmental/carcinogen influences, and DNA repair defects. Using the integrated data sets, we identified 127 significantly mutated genes from well-known(for example, mitogen-activated protein kinase, phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase, Wnt/beta-catenin and receptor tyrosine kinase signalling pathways, and cell cycle control) and emerging (for example, histone, histone modification, splicing, metabolism and proteolysis) cellular processes in cancer. The average number of mutations in these significantly mutated genes varies across tumour types; most tumours have two to six, indicating that the number of driver mutations required during oncogenesis is relatively small. Mutations in transcriptional factors/regulators show tissue specificity, whereas histone modifiers are often mutated across several cancer types. Clinical association analysis identifies genes having a significant effect on survival, and investigations of mutations with respect to clonal/subclonal architecture delineate their temporal orders during tumorigenesis. Taken together, these results lay the groundwork for developing new diagnostics and individualizing cancer treatment.","[Kandoth, Cyriac; McLellan, Michael D.; Ye, Kai; Niu, Beifang; Lu, Charles; Xie, Mingchao; Zhang, Qunyuan; McMichael, Joshua F.; Wyczalkowski, Matthew A.; Miller, Christopher A.; Wendl, Michael C.; Ley, Timothy J.; Wilson, Richard K.; Ding, Li] Washington Univ, Genome Inst, St Louis, MO 63108 USA; [Vandin, Fabio; Leiserson, Mark D.

Here we show that transitory induction of the four factors Oct4, Sox2, Klf4 and c-Myc in mice results in teratomas emerging from multiple organs, implying that full reprogramming can occur in vivo. Analyses of the stomach, intestine, pancreas and kidney reveal groups of dedifferentiated cells that express the pluripotency marker NANOG, indicative of in situ reprogramming. By bone marrow transplantation, we demonstrate that haematopoietic cells can also be reprogrammed in vivo. Notably, reprogrammable mice present circulating iPS cells in the blood and, at the transcriptome level, these in vivo generated iPS cells are closer to embryonic stem cells (ES cells) than standard in vitro generated iPS cells. Moreover, in vivo iPS cells efficiently contribute to the trophectoderm lineage, suggesting that they achieve a more plastic or primitive state than ES cells. Finally, intraperitoneal injection of in vivo iPS cells generates embryo-like structures that express embryonic and extraembryonic markers. We conclude that reprogramming in vivo is feasible and confers totipotency features absent in standard iPS or ES cells. These discoveries could be relevant for future applications of reprogramming in regenerative medicine.","[Abad, Maria; Mosteiro, Lluc; Pantoja, Cristina; Serrano, Manuel] Spanish Natl Canc Res Ctr CNIO, Tumour Suppress Grp, E-28029 Madrid, Spain; [Canamero, Marta] Spanish Natl Canc Res Ctr CNIO, Histopathol Unit, E-28029 Madrid, Spain; [Rayon, Teresa; Ors, Inmaculada; Manzanares, Miguel] Spanish Natl Cardiovasc Res Ctr CNIC, Cardiovasc Dev & Repair Dept, E-28029 Madrid, Spain; [Grana, Osvaldo] Spanish Natl Canc Res Ctr CNIO, Bioinformat Unit, E-28029 Madrid, Spain; [Megias, Diego] Spanish Natl Canc Res Ctr CNIO, Confocal Microscopy Unit, E-28029 Madrid, Spain; [Dominguez, Orlando] Spanish Natl Canc Res Ctr CNIO, Genom Unit, E-28029 Madrid, Spain; [Martinez, Dolores] Spanish Natl Canc Res Ctr CNIO, Flow Cytometry Unit, E-28029 Madrid, Spain; [Ortega, Sagrario] Spanish Natl Canc Res Ctr CNIO, Transgen Mice Unit, E-28029 Madrid, Spain","Serrano, M (reprint author), Spanish Natl Canc Res Ctr CNIO, Tumour Suppress Grp, E-28029 Madrid, Spain.",mserrano@cnio.es,"Megias, Diego/L-6008-2014; Serrano, Manuel/H-2634-2015; Abad, Maria/I-3911-2015; Manzanares, Miguel/E-1702-2015","Serrano, Manuel/0000-0001-7177-9312; Abad, Maria/0000-0002-1462-2498; Manzanares, Miguel/0000-0003-4849-2836; Pantoja, Cristina/0000-0003-0180-5823; Rayon, Teresa/0000-0001-5173-1442","CNIO; Spanish Ministry of Economy (MINECO, SAF); Regional Government of Madrid (ReCaRe); European Union (RISK-IR); Botin Foundation; Ramon Areces Foundation; AXA Foundation; MINECO(BFU); Regional Government of Madrid (Cell-DD); ProCNIC Foundation","We are grateful to M.

Some evolve slowly, resembling models of 'pair-instability' supernovae(5,6). Such models involve stars with original masses 140-260 times that of the Sun that now have carbon-oxygen cores of 65-130 solar masses. In these stars, the photons that prevent gravitational collapse are converted to electron-positron pairs, causing rapid contraction and thermonuclear explosions. Many solar masses of Ni-56 are synthesized; this isotope decays to Fe-56 via Co-56, powering bright light curves(7,8). Such massive progenitors are expected to have formed from metal-poor gas in the early Universe(9). Recently, supernova 2007bi in a galaxy at redshift 0.127 (about 12 billion years after the Big Bang) with a metallicity one-third that of the Sun was observed to look like a fading pair-instability supernova(1,10). Here we report observations of two slow-to-fade super-luminous supernovae that show relatively fast rise times and blue colours, which are incompatible with pair-instability models. Their late-time light-curve and spectral similarities to supernova 2007bi call the nature of that event into question. Our early spectra closely resemble typical fast-declining super-luminous supernovae(2,11,12), which are not powered by radio-activity. Modelling our observations with 10-16 solar masses of magnetar-energized(13,14) ejecta demonstrates the possibility of a common explosion mechanism. The lack of unambiguous nearby pair-instability events suggests that their local rate of occurrence is less than 6 x 10(-6) times that of the core-collapse rate.","[Nicholl, M.; Smartt, S.

Measuring a quantum system typically steers it towards a classical state, destroying the coherence of an initial quantum superposition and the entanglement with other quantum systems. Remarkably, the measurement of a shared property between non-interacting quantum systems can generate entanglement, starting from an uncorrelated state. Of special interest in quantum computing is the parity measurement(1), which projects the state of multiple qubits (quantum bits) to a state with an even or odd number of excited qubits. A parity meter must discern the two qubit-excitation parities with high fidelity while preserving coherence between same-parity states. Despite numerous proposals for atomic(2), semiconducting(1,3-7) and superconducting qubits(8,9), realizing a parity meter that creates entanglement for both even and odd measurement results has remained an outstanding challenge. Here we perform a time-resolved, continuous parity measurement of two superconducting qubits using the cavity in a three-dimensional circuit quantum electrodynamics(10,11) architecture and phase-sensitive parametric amplification(12). Using postselection, we produce entanglement by parity measurement reaching 88 per cent fidelity to the closest Bell state. Incorporating the parity meter in a feedback-control loop, we transform the entanglement generation from probabilistic to fully deterministic, achieving 66 per cent fidelity to a target Bell state on demand. These realizations of a parity meter and a feedback-enabled deterministic measurement protocol provide key ingredients for active quantum error correction in the solid state(13-15).","[Riste, D.; Dukalski, M.; Watson, C.

One example is coherent Raman spectroscopy, a versatile technique interrogating vibrational transitions in molecules. It offers high spatial resolution and three-dimensional sectioning capabilities that make it a label-free tool(1,2) for the non-destructive and chemically selective probing of complex systems. Indeed, single-colour Raman bands have been imaged in biological tissue at video rates(3,4) by using ultra-short-pulse lasers. However, identifying multiple, and possibly unknown, molecules requires broad spectral bandwidth and high resolution. Moderate spectral spans combined with high-speed acquisition are now within reach using multichannel detection(5) or frequency-swept laser beams(6-9). Laser frequency combs(10) are finding increasing use for broadband molecular linear absorption spectroscopy(11-15). Here we show, by exploring their potential for nonlinear spectroscopy(16), that they can be harnessed for coherent anti-Stokes Raman spectroscopy and spectro-imaging. The method uses two combs and can simultaneously measure, on the microsecond timescale, all spectral elements over a wide bandwidth and with high resolution on a single photodetector. Although the overall measurement time in our proof-of-principle experiments is limited by the waiting times between successive spectral acquisitions, this limitation can be overcome with further system development. We therefore expect that our approach of using laser frequency combs will not only enable new applications for nonlinear microscopy but also benefit other nonlinear spectroscopic techniques.","[Ideguchi, Takuro; Holzner, Simon; Bernhardt, Birgitta; Picque, Nathalie; Haensch, Theodor W.] Max Planck Inst Quantum Opt, D-85748 Garching, Germany; [Guelachvili, Guy; Picque, Nathalie] Univ Paris 11, CNRS, Inst Sci Mol Orsay, F-91405 Orsay, France; [Bernhardt, Birgitta; Picque, Nathalie; Haensch, Theodor W.] Univ Munich, Fak Phys, D-80799 Munich, Germany","Picque, N (reprint author), Max Planck Inst Quantum Opt, Hans Kopfermann Str 1, D-85748 Garching, Germany.",nathalie.picque@mpq.mpg.de,"Ideguchi, Takuro/O-2542-2014; Bernhardt, Birgitta/L-9424-2015","Bernhardt, Birgitta/0000-0001-7537-4689",Max Planck Foundation; Munich Center for Advanced Photonics; Eurostars; European Research Council [267854],"We thank P.

Aerosols can cause a net cooling of climate by scattering sunlight and by leading to smaller but more numerous cloud droplets, which makes clouds brighter and extends their lifetimes(2). Atmospheric aerosols derived from human activities are thought to have compensated for a large fraction of the warming caused by greenhouse gases(2). However, despite its importance for climate, atmospheric nucleation is poorly understood. Recently, it has been shown that sulphuric acid and ammonia cannot explain particle formation rates observed in the lower atmosphere(3). It is thought that amines may enhance nucleation(4-16), but until now there has been no direct evidence for amine ternary nucleation under atmospheric conditions. Here we use the CLOUD (Cosmics Leaving OUtdoor Droplets) chamber at CERN and find that dimethylamine above three parts per trillion by volume can enhance particle formation rates more than 1,000-fold compared with ammonia, sufficient to account for the particle formation rates observed in the atmosphere. Molecular analysis of the clusters reveals that the faster nucleation is explained by a base-stabilization mechanism involving acid-amine pairs, which strongly decrease evaporation. The ion-induced contribution is generally small, reflecting the high stability of sulphuric acid-dimethylamine clusters and indicating that galactic cosmic rays exert only a small influence on their formation, except at low overall formation rates. Our experimental measurements are well reproduced by a dynamical model based on quantum chemical calculations of binding energies of molecular clusters, without any fitted parameters. These results show that, in regions of the atmosphere near amine sources, both amines and sulphur dioxide should be considered when assessing the impact of anthropogenic activities on particle formation.","[Almeida, Joao;

This association provides novel data for addressing long-standing controversies about the segmental identities of specialized head appendages in fossil taxa(2,3). Here we document neuroanatomy in the head and trunk of a 'great appendage' arthropod, Alalcomenaeus sp., from the Chengjiang biota, southwest China, providing the most complete neuroanatomical profile known from a Cambrian animal. Micro-computed tomography reveals a configuration of one optic neuropil separate from a protocerebrum contiguous with four head ganglia, succeeded by eight contiguous ganglia in an eleven-segment trunk. Arrangements of optic neuropils, the brain and ganglia correspond most closely to the nervous system of Chelicerata of all extant arthropods, supporting the assignment of 'great appendage' arthropods to the chelicerate total group(4,5). The position of the deutocerebral neuromere aligns with the insertion of the great appendage, indicating its deutocerebral innervation and corroborating a homology between the 'great appendage' and chelicera indicated by morphological similarities(4,6,7). Alalcomenaeus and Fuxianhuia protensa(1) demonstrate that the two main configurations of the brain observed in modern arthropods, those of Chelicerata and Mandibulata, respectively(8), had evolved by the early Cambrian.","[Tanaka, Gengo] Japan Agcy Marine Earth Sci & Technol, Yokosuka, Kanagawa 2370061, Japan; [Hou, Xianguang; Ma, Xiaoya] Yunnan Univ, Yunnan Key Lab Palaeobiol, Kunming 650091, Peoples R China; [Ma, Xiaoya; Edgecombe, Gregory D.] Nat Hist Museum, Dept Earth Sci, London SW7 5BD, England; [Strausfeld, Nicholas J.] Univ Arizona, Dept Neurosci, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA; [Strausfeld, Nicholas J.] Univ Arizona, Ctr Insect Sci, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA","Hou, XG (reprint author), Yunnan Univ, Yunnan Key Lab Palaeobiol, Kunming 650091, Peoples R China.",xghou@ynu.edu.cn; flybrain@email.arizona.edu,,"Edgecombe, Gregory/0000-0002-9591-8011","Natural Science Foundation of China [40730211]; Research in Education and Science from the Government of Japan [21740370]; Leverhulme Trust [F/00 696/T]; Center for Insect Science, University of Arizona; Air Force Research Laboratories [FA8651-10-1-0001]","We thank N.

Appropriate behavioural responses depend on sensory input received during social interactions. In mice, social behaviour is driven by pheromones, chemical signals that encode information related to age, sex and physiological state(1). However, although mice show different social behaviours towards adults, juveniles and neonates, sensory cues that enable specific recognition of juvenile mice are unknown. Here we describe a juvenile pheromone produced by young mice before puberty, termed exocrine-gland secreting peptide 22 (ESP22). ESP22 is secreted from the lacrimal gland and released into tears of 2- to 3-week-old mice. Upon detection, ESP22 activates high-affinity sensory neurons in the vomeronasal organ, and down-stream limbic neurons in the medial amygdala. Recombinant ESP22, painted on mice, exerts a powerful inhibitory effect on adult male mating behaviour, which is abolished in knockout mice lacking TRPC2, a key signalling component of the vomeronasal organ(2,3). Furthermore, knockout of TRPC2 or loss of ESP22 production results in increased sexual behaviour of adult males towards juveniles, and sexual responses towards ESP22-deficient juveniles are suppressed by ESP22 painting. Thus, we describe a pheromone of sexually immature mice that controls an innate social behaviour, a response pathway through the accessory olfactory system and a new role for vomeronasal organ signalling in inhibiting sexual behaviour towards young. These findings provide a molecular framework for understanding how a sensory system can regulate behaviour.","[Ferrero, David M.; Li, Qian; Roy, Dheeraj S.; Liberles, Stephen D.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Cell Biol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Moeller, Lisa M.; Cichy, Annika; Spehr, Marc] Rhein Westfal TH Aachen, Dept Chemosensat, Inst Biol 2, Aachen, Germany; [Osakada, Takuya; Horio, Nao; Touhara, Kazushige] Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Agr & Life Sci, Dept Appl Biol Chem, Tokyo 1138657, Japan; [Touhara, Kazushige] Univ Tokyo, Japan Sci & Technol Agcy, ERATO Touhara Chemosensory Signal Project, Tokyo 1138657, Japan","Liberles, SD (reprint author), Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Cell Biol, Boston, MA 02115 USA.",Stephen_Liberles@hms.harvard.edu,"Spehr, Marc/B-3140-2011; Li, Qian/P-4417-2015","Spehr, Marc/0000-0001-6616-4196; Li, Qian/0000-0003-1300-3377",National Institutes of Health [R01 DC010155]; Japan Society for the Promotion of Science; ERATO Touhara Chemosensory Signal Project from the Japan Science and Technology Agency; Boehringer Ingelheim Fonds PhD Fellowship,"We thank M.

CaMKII activation is seen in heart failure, and can directly induce pathological changes in ion channels, Ca2+ handling and gene transcription(1). Here, in human, rat and mouse, we identify a novel mechanism linking CaMKII and hyperglycaemic signalling in diabetes mellitus, which is a key risk factor for heart(2) and neurodegenerative diseases(3,4). Acute hyperglycaemia causes covalent modification of CaMKII by O-linked N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc). O-GlcNAc modification of CaMKII at Ser 279 activates CaMKII autonomously, creating molecular memory even after Ca2+ concentration declines. O-GlcNAc-modified CaMKII is increased in the heart and brain of diabetic humans and rats. In cardiomyocytes, increased glucose concentration significantly enhances CaMKII-dependent activation of spontaneous sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ release events that can contribute to cardiac mechanical dysfunction and arrhythmias(1). These effects were prevented by pharmacological inhibition of O-GlcNAc signalling or genetic ablation of CaMKII delta. In intact perfused hearts, arrhythmias were aggravated by increased glucose concentration through O-GlcNAc- and CaMKII-dependent pathways. In diabetic animals, acute blockade of O-GlcNAc inhibited arrhythmogenesis. Thus, O-GlcNAc modification of CaMKII is a novel signalling event in pathways that may contribute critically to cardiac and neuronal pathophysiology in diabetes and other diseases.","[Erickson, Jeffrey R.; Pereira, Laetitia; Wang, Lianguo; Ferguson, Amanda; Dao, Khanha; Despa, Florin; Ripplinger, Crystal M.; Bers, Donald M.] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Pharmacol, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Erickson, Jeffrey R.] Univ Otago, Dept Physiol, Dunedin 9054, New Zealand; [Han, Guanghui; Copeland, Ronald J.; Hart, Gerald W.] Johns Hopkins Univ, Sch Med, Dept Biol Chem, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA; [Despa, Florin] Univ Kentucky, Dept Mol & Biomed Pharmacol, Lexington, KY 40536 USA","Bers, DM (reprint author), Univ Calif Davis, Dept Pharmacol, 451 Hlth Sci Dr, Davis, CA 95616 USA.",dmbers@ucdavis.edu,"; Han, Guanghui/N-8573-2013; Wang, Lianguo/B-5644-2012","Bers, Donald/0000-0002-2237-9483; Han, Guanghui/0000-0002-9893-9168; Wang, Lianguo/0000-0002-4747-0419; Ripplinger, Crystal/0000-0002-9908-4106","American Heart Association [13SDG14680072]; National Institutes of Health (NIH) [T32HL86350, 1R01HL118474-01A1, R01DK61671, P01HL107153, R01HL111600, P01HL080101, R37HL30077]; NSF CBET [1133339]; ADA [1-13-IN-70]; AHA [13GRNT16470034]; Fondation Leducq Transatlantic CaMKII Alliance","We thank Y.

However, statins are associated with an increased risk, albeit small, of clinical myopathy(4) and type 2 diabetes(5). Despite evidence for substantial genetic influence on LDL concentrations(6), pharmacogenomic trials have failed to identify genetic variations with large effects on either statin efficacy(7-9) or toxicity(10), and have produced little information regarding mechanisms that modulate statin response. Here we identify a downstream target of statin treatment by screening for the effects of in vitro statin exposure on genetic associations with gene expression levels in lymphoblastoid cell lines derived from 480 participants of a clinical trial of simvastatin treatment(7). This analysis identified six expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) that interacted with simvastatin exposure, including rs9806699, a cis-eQTL for the gene glycine amidinotransferase (GATM) that encodes the rate-limiting enzyme in creatine synthesis. We found this locus to be associated with incidence of statin-induced myotoxicity in two separate populations (meta-analysis odds ratio = 0.60). Furthermore, we found that GATM knockdown in hepatocyte-derived cell lines attenuated transcriptional response to sterol depletion, demonstrating that GATM may act as a functional link between statin-mediated lowering of cholesterol and susceptibility to statin-induced myopathy.","[Mangravite, Lara M.; Mecham, Brigham H.] Sage Bionetworks, Seattle, WA 98109 USA; [Engelhardt, Barbara E.; Howie, Bryan; Shim, Heejung; Stephens, Matthew] Univ Chicago, Dept Human Genet, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Medina, Marisa W.; Naidoo, Devesh; Krauss, Ronald M.] Childrens Hosp Oakland, Res Inst, Oakland, CA 94609 USA; [Smith, Joshua D.; Rieder, Mark J.; Nickerson, Deborah A.] Univ Washington, Dept Genome Sci, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Brown, Christopher D.] Univ Penn, Dept Genet, Philadelphia, PA 19103 USA; [Chasman, Daniel I.; Ridker, Paul M.] Brigham & Womens Hosp, Div Preventat Med, Ctr Cardiovasc Dis Prevent, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Feng, QiPing; Wilke, Russell A.] Vanderbilt Univ, Med Ctr, Div Clin Pharmacol, Dept Med, Nashville, TN 37232 USA; [Chen, Yii-Der I.; Rotter, Jerome I.] Harbor UCLA Med Ctr, Los Angeles BioMed Res Inst, Inst Translat Genom & Populat Sci, Torrance, CA 90502 USA; [Hopewell, Jemma C.; Parish, Sarah; Armitage, Jane; Collins, Rory] Univ Oxford, Clin Trial Serv Unit, Oxford OX3 7LF, England; [Hopewell, Jemma C.; Parish, Sarah; Armitage, Jane; Collins, Rory] Univ Oxford, Epidemiol Studies Unit, Oxford OX3 7LF, England; [Stephens, Matthew] Univ Chicago, Dept Stat, Chicago, IL 60637 USA","Mangravite, LM (reprint author), Sage Bionetworks, 1100 Fairview Ave North, Seattle, WA 98109 USA.",lara.mangravite@sagebase.org; mstephens@uchicago.edu; rkrauss@chori.org,,"Brown, Christopher/0000-0002-3785-5008; Engelhardt, Barbara/0000-0002-6139-7334","US National Institutes of Health (NIH) [U01 HL69757]; Bioinformatics Research Development Fund; NIH [K99/R00HG006265, HG002585]; Medical Research Council; British Heart Foundation; National Health Service Genetic Knowledge Park; Centre National de Genotypage; Merck; Roche Vitamins; BHF Centre of Research Excellence, Oxford, UK; AstraZeneca","This project was funded by a grant from the US National Institutes of Health (NIH), U01 HL69757.

Previous studies have implicated the 3'-5' superfamily 2 helicase HELQ in ICL repair in Drosophila melanogaster (MUS301 (ref. 3)) and Caenorhabditis elegans (HELQ-1 (ref. 4)). Although in vitro analysis suggests that HELQ preferentially unwinds synthetic replication fork substrates with 3' single-stranded DNA overhangs and also disrupts protein DNA interactions while translocating along DNA(5,6), little is known regarding its functions in mammalian organisms. Here we report that HELQ helicase-deficient mice exhibit subfertility, germ cell attrition, ICL sensitivity and tumour predisposition, with Helq heterozygous mice exhibiting a similar, albeit less severe, phenotype than the null, indicative of haploinsufficiency. We establish that HELQ interacts directly with the RAD51 paralogue complex BCDX2 and functions in parallel to the Fanconi anaemia pathway to promote efficient homologous recombination at damaged replication forks. Thus, our results reveal a critical role for HELQ in replication-coupled DNA repair, germ cell maintenance and tumour suppression in mammals.","[Adelman, Carrie A.; Lolo, Rafal L.; Matsuzaki, Kenichiro; Horejsi, Zuzana; Borel, Valerie; Boulton, Simon J.] Canc Res UK, London Res Inst, DNA Damage Response Lab, S Mimms EN6 3LD, Herts, England; [Birkbak, Nicolai J.] Tech Univ Denmark, Ctr Biol Sequence Anal, DK-2800 Lyngby, Denmark; [Murina, Olga; Sartori, Alessandro A.] Univ Zurich, Inst Mol Canc Res, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland; [Parmar, Kalindi; D'Andrea, Alan] Dana Farber Canc Inst, Dept Radiat Oncol, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Skehel, J.

Most studies have focused on specific proteins, which identify cognate sites by binding with highest affinities to regions with defined signatures in sequence, structure or both(1-4). Proteins that bind to sites devoid of defined sequence or structure signatures are considered nonspecific(1,2,5). Substrate binding by these proteins is poorly understood, and it is not known to what extent seemingly nonspecific proteins discriminate between different binding sites, aside from those sequestered by nucleic acid structures(6). Here we systematically examine substrate binding by the apparently nonspecific RNA-binding protein C5, and find clear discrimination between different binding site variants. C5 is the protein subunit of the transfer RNA processing ribonucleoprotein enzyme RNase P from Escherichia coli. The protein binds 59 leaders of precursor tRNAs at a site without sequence or structure signatures. We measure functional binding of C5 to all possible sequence variants in its substrate binding site, using a high-throughput sequencing kinetics approach (HITS-KIN) that simultaneously follows processing of thousands of RNA species. C5 binds different substrate variants with affinities varying by orders of magnitude. The distribution of functional affinities of C5 for all substrate variants resembles affinity distributions of highly specific nucleic acid binding proteins. Unlike these specific proteins, C5 does not bind its physiological RNA targets with the highest affinity, but with affinities near the median of the distribution, a region that is not associated with a sequence signature. We delineate defined rules governing substrate recognition by C5, which reveal specificity that is hidden in cellular substrates for RNase P. Our findings suggest that apparently nonspecific and specific RNA-binding modes may not differ fundamentally, but represent distinct parts of common affinity distributions.","[Guenther, Ulf-Peter; Campbell, Frank E.; Jankowsky, Eckhard] Case Western Reserve Univ, Ctr RNA Mol Biol, Cleveland, OH 44106 USA; [Guenther, Ulf-Peter; Yandek, Lindsay E.; Niland, Courtney N.; Anderson, Vernon E.; Harris, Michael E.; Jankowsky, Eckhard] Case Western Reserve Univ, Sch Med, Dept Biochem, Cleveland, OH 44106 USA; [Anderson, David] CUNY, Baruch Coll, Zicklin Sch Business, Dept Management, New York, NY 10010 USA","Harris, ME (reprint author), Case Western Reserve Univ, Sch Med, Dept Biochem, Cleveland, OH 44106 USA.",meh2@case.edu; exj13@case.edu,,"Jankowsky, Eckhard/0000-0001-7677-7412","US National Institutes of Health (NIH) [GM067700, GM099720, CSTA UL1RR024989, GM056740, GM096000, T32 GM008056]; DFG","We particularly thank T.

However, the repair of DSBs can also destabilize the genome by causing mutations and chromosomal rearrangements, the driving forces for carcinogenesis and hereditary diseases. Break-induced replication (BIR) is one of the DSB repair pathways that is highly prone to genetic instability(1-3). BIR proceeds by invasion of one broken end into a homologous DNA sequence followed by replication that can copy hundreds of kilobases of DNA from a donor molecule all the way through its telomere(4,5). The resulting repaired chromosome comes at a great cost to the cell, as BIR promotes mutagenesis, loss of heterozygosity, translocations, and copy number variations, all hallmarks of carcinogenesis(4-9). BIR uses most known replication proteins to copy large portions of DNA, similar to S-phase replication(10,11). It has therefore been suggested that BIR proceeds by semiconservative replication; however, the model of a bona fide, stable replication fork contradicts the known instabilities associated with BIR such as a 1,000-fold increase in mutation rate compared to normal replication(9). Here we demonstrate that in budding yeast the mechanism of replication during BIR is significantly different from S-phase replication, as it proceeds via an unusual bubble-like replication fork that results in conservative inheritance of the new genetic material. We provide evidence that this atypical mode of DNA replication, dependent on Pif1 helicase, is responsible for the marked increase in BIR-associated mutations. We propose that the BIR mode of synthesis presents a powerful mechanism that can initiate bursts of genetic instability in eukaryotes, including humans.","[Saini, Natalie; Zhang, Yu; Lobachev, Kirill S.] Georgia Inst Technol, Sch Biol, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA; [Saini, Natalie; Zhang, Yu; Lobachev, Kirill S.] Georgia Inst Technol, Inst Bioengn & Biosci, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA; [Ramakrishnan, Sreejith; Elango, Rajula; Ayyar, Sandeep; Deem, Angela; Malkova, Anna] IUPUI, Dept Biol, Indianapolis, IN 46202 USA; [Ira, Grzegorz] Baylor Coll Med, Dept Mol & Human Genet, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Haber, James E.] Dept Biol, Waltham, MA 02454 USA; [Haber, James E.] Rosenstiel Basic Med Sci Res Ctr, Waltham, MA 02454 USA; [Malkova, Anna] Univ Iowa, Dept Biol, Coll Liberal Arts & Sci, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA","Malkova, A (reprint author), IUPUI, Dept Biol, Indianapolis, IN 46202 USA.",kirill.lobachev@biology.gatech.edu; amalkova@iupui.edu,,"ayyar, sandeep/0000-0003-1178-6806","US National Institutes of Health; National Science Foundation; NSF [MCB-0818122]; NIH [R01GM084242, R01GM082950, R03ES016434, GM76020, GM080600]","We thank O.

Multiple DNA polymerases have been implicated in repair-specific DNA synthesis(1-3), but it has remained unclear whether a DNA helicase is involved in this reaction. A good candidate DNA helicase is Pif1, an evolutionarily conserved helicase in Saccharomyces cerevisiae important for break-induced replication (BIR)(4) as well as HR-dependent telomere maintenance in the absence of telomerase(5) found in 10-15% of all cancers(6). Pif1 has a role in DNA synthesis across hard-to-replicate sites(7,8) and in lagging-strand synthesis with polymerase delta (Pol delta)(9-11). Here we provide evidence that Pif1 stimulates DNA synthesis during BIR and crossover recombination. The initial steps of BIR occur normally in Pif1-deficient cells, but Pol delta recruitment and DNA synthesis are decreased, resulting in premature resolution of DNA intermediates into half-crossovers. Purified Pif1 protein strongly stimulates Pol delta-mediated DNA synthesis from a D-loop made by the Rad51 recombinase. Notably, Pif1 liberates the newly synthesized strand to prevent the accumulation of topological constraint and to facilitate extensive DNA synthesis via the establishment of a migrating D-loop structure. Our results uncover a novel function of Pif1 and provide insights into the mechanism of HR.","[Wilson, Marenda A.; Chung, Woo-Hyun; Mayle, Ryan; Chen, Xuefeng; Ira, Grzegorz] Baylor Coll Med, Dept Mol & Human Genet, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Kwon, YoungHo; Xu, Yuanyuan; Niu, Hengyao; Sung, Patrick] Yale Univ, Sch Med, Dept Mol Biophys & Biochem, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Chung, Woo-Hyun] Duksung Womens Univ, Coll Pharm, Seoul 132714, South Korea; [Chi, Peter] Natl Taiwan Univ, Inst Biochem Sci, Taipei 10617, Taiwan; [Chi, Peter] Acad Sinica, Inst Biol Chem, Taipei 115, Taiwan; [Malkova, Anna] IUPUI, Sch Sci, Dept Biol, Indianapolis, IN 46202 USA","Ira, G (reprint author), Baylor Coll Med, Dept Mol & Human Genet, 1 Baylor Plaza, Houston, TX 77030 USA.",patrick.sung@yale.edu; gira@bcm.edu,"Niu, Hengyao/B-5026-2014",,"US National Institutes of Health [GM080600, ES007061, GM057814, ES015632, GM084242, T32GM07526-34]; National Research Foundation of Korea [NRF-2012R1A1A1009917]; Academia Sinica; National Taiwan University; National Science Council of Taiwan","We thank V.

Here we present a new index of the year when the projected mean climate of a given location moves to a state continuously outside the bounds of historical variability under alternative greenhouse gas emissions scenarios. Using 1860 to 2005 as the historical period, this index has a global mean of 2069 (+/- 18 years s.d.) for near-surface air temperature under an emissions stabilization scenario and 2047 (+/- 14 years s.d.) under a 'business-as-usual' scenario. Unprecedented climates will occur earliest in the tropics and among low-income countries, highlighting the vulnerability of global biodiversity and the limited governmental capacity to respond to the impacts of climate change.

The polarities of these differences, and the morphology of the last common ancestor of crown gnathostomes, are the subject of continuing debate. Here we describe a three-dimensionally preserved 419-million-year-old placoderm fish from the Silurian of China that represents the first stem gnathostome with dermal marginal jaw bones (premaxilla, maxilla and dentary), features previously restricted to Osteichthyes. A phylogenetic analysis places the new form near the top of the gnathostome stem group but does not fully resolve its relationships to other placoderms. The analysis also assigns all acanthodians to the chondrichthyan stem group. These results suggest that the last common ancestor of Chondrichthyes and Osteichthyes had a macromeric dermal skeleton, and provide a new framework for studying crown gnathostome divergence.","[Zhu, Min; Yu, Xiaobo; Choo, Brian; Lu, Jing; Qiao, Tuo; Zhao, Wenjin; Jia, Liantao; Zhu, You'an] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Vertebrate Paleontol & Paleoanthropol, Key Lab Vertebrate Evolut & Human Origins, Beijing 100044, Peoples R China; [Yu, Xiaobo] Kean Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Union, NJ 07083 USA; [Ahlberg, Per Erik; Qu, Qingming; Blom, Henning] Uppsala Univ, Dept Organismal Biol, Evolutionary Biol Ctr, Subdept Evolut & Dev, S-75236 Uppsala, Sweden","Zhu, M (reprint author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Vertebrate Paleontol & Paleoanthropol, Key Lab Vertebrate Evolut & Human Origins, Beijing 100044, Peoples R China.",zhumin@ivpp.ac.cn,"Yu, Xiaobo/G-7160-2011; Qu, Qingming/R-7194-2016","Qu, Qingming/0000-0002-8291-8493; Yu, Xiaobo/0000-0001-9600-7888",Major State Basic Research Projects of MST of China [2012CB821902]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [40930208]; ERC [233111]; Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation,"We thank M.-M.

The recently discovered role of primary cilia in nutrient sensing and signalling motivated us to explore the possible functional interactions between this signalling hub and autophagy. Here we show that part of the molecular machinery involved in ciliogenesis also participates in the early steps of the autophagic process. Signalling from the cilia, such as that from the Hedgehog pathway, induces autophagy by acting directly on essential autophagy-related proteins strategically located in the base of the cilium by ciliary trafficking proteins. Whereas abrogation of ciliogenesis partially inhibits autophagy, blockage of autophagy enhances primary cilia growth and cilia-associated signalling during normal nutritional conditions. We propose that basal autophagy regulates ciliary growth through the degradation of proteins required for intraflagellar transport. Compromised ability to activate the autophagic response may underlie some common ciliopathies.","[Pampliega, Olatz; Patel, Bindi; Sridhar, Sunandini; Diaz-Carretero, Antonio; Cuervo, Ana Maria] Albert Einstein Coll Med, Dept Dev & Mol Biol, Bronx, NY 10461 USA; [Orhon, Idil; Codogno, Patrice] INSERM, U845, F-75014 Paris, France; [Orhon, Idil; Codogno, Patrice] Paris Descartes Univ, F-75014 Paris, France; [Orhon, Idil; Beau, Isabelle; Codogno, Patrice] INSERM, U984, F-92296 Chatenay Malabry, France; [Orhon, Idil; Beau, Isabelle; Codogno, Patrice] Univ Paris 11, F-92296 Chatenay Malabry, France; [Satir, Birgit H.; Satir, Peter; Cuervo, Ana Maria] Albert Einstein Coll Med, Dept Anat & Struct Biol, Bronx, NY 10461 USA; [Cuervo, Ana Maria] Albert Einstein Coll Med, Inst Aging Studies, Bronx, NY 10461 USA","Cuervo, AM (reprint author), Albert Einstein Coll Med, Dept Dev & Mol Biol, Bronx, NY 10461 USA.",peter.satir@einstein.yu.edu; ana-maria.cuervo@einstein.yu.edu,"Beau, Isabelle/M-4423-2017","Cuervo, Ana Maria/0000-0002-0771-700X","National Institute of Health National Institute on Aging [AG031782, AG038072]; National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases [DK098408]; Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale; Institut National du Cancer and L'Agence Nationale de la Recherche; Basque Government","We thank N.

In a manner similar to that of electrons orbiting in an atom, protons and neutrons in a nucleus form shell structures. In the case of stable, naturally occurring nuclei, large energy gaps exist between shells that fill completely when the proton or neutron number is equal to 2, 8, 20, 28, 50, 82 or 126 (ref. 1). Away from stability, however, these so-called 'magic numbers' are known to evolve in systems with a large imbalance of protons and neutrons. Although some of the standard shell closures can disappear, new ones are known to appear(2,3). Studies aiming to identify and understand such behaviour are of major importance in the field of experimental and theoretical nuclear physics. Here we report a spectroscopic study of the neutron-rich nucleus Ca-54 (a bound system composed of 20 protons and 34 neutrons) using proton knockout reactions involving fast radioactive projectiles. The results highlight the doubly magic nature of Ca-54 and provide direct experimental evidence for the onset of a sizable subshell closure at neutron number 34 in isotopes far from stability.","[Steppenbeck, D.; Matsushita, M.; Go, S.; Michimasa, S.; Otsuka, T.] Univ Tokyo, Ctr Nucl Study, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo 1130033, Japan; [Takeuchi, S.; Doornenbal, P.; Wang, H.; Baba, H.; Fukuda, N.; Lee, J.; Motobayashi, T.; Sakurai, H.; Soederstroem, P. -A.; Suzuki, H.; Yoneda, K.] RIKEN Nishina Ctr, Wako, Saitama 3510198, Japan; [Aoi, N.] Osaka Univ, Res Ctr Nucl Phys, Osaka 5670047, Japan; [Honma, M.] Aizu Univ, Ctr Math Sci, Aizu Wakamatsu, Fukushima 9658580, Japan; [Matsui, K.; Otsuka, T.; Sakurai, H.; Taniuchi, R.] Univ Tokyo, Dept Phys, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo 1130033, Japan; [Nishimura, D.] Tokyo Univ Sci, Dept Phys, Noda, Chiba 2788510, Japan; [Shiga, Y.] Rikkyo Univ, Dept Phys, Toshima Ku, Tokyo 1718501, Japan; [Sumikama, T.] Tohoku Univ, Dept Phys, Sendai, Miyagi 9808578, Japan; [Utsuno, Y.] Japan Atom Energy Agcy, Tokai, Ibaraki 3191195, Japan; [Valiente-Dobon, J.

This interaction entangles the quantum state with the inherent fluctuations of the environment. If these fluctuations are not measured, the environment can be viewed as a source of noise, causing random evolution of the quantum system from an initially pure state into a statistical mixture-a process known as decoherence. However, by accurately measuring the environment in real time, the quantum system can be maintained in a pure state and its time evolution described by a 'quantum trajectory'(1,2) determined by the measurement outcome. Here we use weak measurements to monitor a microwave cavity containing a superconducting quantum bit (qubit), and track the individual quantum trajectories(3) of the system. In this setup, the environment is dominated by the fluctuations of a single electromagnetic mode of the cavity. Using a near-quantum-limited parametric amplifier(4,5), we selectively measure either the phase or the amplitude of the cavity field, and thereby confine trajectories to either the equator or a meridian of the Bloch sphere. We perform quantum state tomography at discrete times along the trajectory to verify that we have faithfully tracked the state of the quantum system as it diffuses on the surface of the Bloch sphere. Our results demonstrate that decoherence can be mitigated by environmental monitoring, and validate the foundation of quantum feedback approaches based on Bayesian statistics(6-8). Moreover, our experiments suggest a new means of implementing 'quantum steering'(9)-the harnessing of action at a distance to manipulate quantum states through measurement.","[Murch, K. W.; Weber, S.

Initially limited to intermetallic systems(1-4), the observation of quasicrystalline structures has recently expanded to include 'soft' quasicrystals in the fields of colloidal and supermolecular chemistry(5-9). Here we report an aperiodic oxide that grows as a two-dimensional quasicrystal on a periodic single-element substrate. On a Pt(111) substrate with 3-fold symmetry, the perovskite barium titanate BaTiO3 forms a high-temperature interface-driven structure with 12-fold symmetry. The building blocks of this dodecagonal structure assemble with the theoretically predicted Stampfli-Gahler tiling(10,11) having a fundamental length-scale of 0.69 nm. This example of interface-driven formation of ultrathin quasicrystals from a typical periodic perovskite oxide potentially extends the quasicrystal concept to a broader range of materials. In addition, it demonstrates that frustration at the interface between two periodic materials can drive a thin film into an aperiodic quasicrystalline phase, as proposed previously(12). Such structures might also find use as ultrathin buffer layers for the accommodation of large lattice mismatches in conventional epitaxy(13).","[Foerster, Stefan; Meinel, Klaus; Hammer, Rene; Trautmann, Martin; Widdra, Wolf] Univ Halle Wittenberg, Inst Phys, D-06120 Halle, Germany; [Widdra, Wolf] Max Planck Inst Mikrostrukturphys, D-06120 Halle, Germany","Widdra, W (reprint author), Univ Halle Wittenberg, Inst Phys, D-06120 Halle, Germany.",wolf.widdra@physik.uni-halle.de,,"Widdra, Wolf/0000-0003-1884-8715",Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft [Sonderforschungsbereich 762],"We thank P.

This is a consequence of the geographical localization of intense, westward drifting, equatorial magnetic flux patches at the core surface(3). Despite successes in explaining the morphology of the geomagnetic field(4), numerical models of the geodynamo have so far failed to account systematically for this striking pattern of geomagnetic secular variation. Here we show that it can be reproduced provided that two mechanisms relying on the inner core are jointly considered. First, gravitational coupling(5) aligns the inner core with the mantle, forcing the flow of liquid metal in the outer core into a giant, westward drifting, sheet-like gyre(6). The resulting shear concentrates azimuthal magnetic flux at low latitudes close to the core-mantle boundary, where it is expelled by core convection and subsequently transported westward. Second, differential inner-core growth(7,8), fastest below Indonesia(6,9), causes an asymmetric buoyancy release in the outer core which in turn distorts the gyre, forcing it to become eccentric, in agreement with recent core flow inversions(6,10,11). This bottom-up heterogeneous driving of core convection dominates top-down driving from mantle thermal heterogeneities, and localizes magnetic variations in a longitudinal sector centred beneath the Atlantic, where the eccentric gyre reaches the core surface. To match the observed pattern of geomagnetic secular variation, the solid material forming the inner core must now be in a state of differential growth rather than one of growth and melting induced by convective translation(7,8).","[Aubert, Julien; Fournier, Alexandre] Univ Paris Diderot, Inst Phys Globe Paris, Sorbonne Paris Cite, UMR 7154,CNRS, F-75005 Paris, France; [Finlay, Christopher C.] Tech Univ Denmark, Natl Space Inst, Div Geomagnetism, DK-2800 Lyngby, Denmark","Aubert, J (reprint author), Univ Paris Diderot, Inst Phys Globe Paris, Sorbonne Paris Cite, UMR 7154,CNRS, F-75005 Paris, France.",aubert@ipgp.fr,"Aubert, Julien/A-5616-2011; Finlay, Christopher/B-5062-2014; Fournier, Alexandre/A-5774-2011","Aubert, Julien/0000-0002-2756-0724; Finlay, Christopher/0000-0002-4592-2290; Fournier, Alexandre/0000-0003-3276-0496","French Agence Nationale de la Recherche [ANR-2011-BS56-011]; GENCI-IDRIS [2012-042122, 2013-042122]","This work was supported by the French Agence Nationale de la Recherche (grant ANR-2011-BS56-011).

Many tropical forests possess tree species capable of fixing atmospheric dinitrogen (N-2)(7), but it is unclear whether this functional group can supply the nitrogen needed as forests recover from disturbance or previous land use(1), or expand in response to rising CO2 (refs 6, 8). Here we identify a powerful feedback mechanism in which N-2 fixation can overcome ecosystem-scale deficiencies in nitrogen that emerge during periods of rapid biomass accumulation in tropical forests. Over a 300-year chronosequence in Panama, N-2-fixing tree species accumulated carbon up to nine times faster per individual than their non-fixing neighbours (greatest difference in youngest forests), and showed species-specific differences in the amount and timing of fixation. As a result of fast growth and high fixation, fixers provided a large fraction of the nitrogen needed to support net forest growth (50,000 kg carbon per hectare) in the first 12 years. A key element of ecosystem functional diversity was ensured by the presence of different N-2-fixing tree species across the entire forest age sequence. These findings show that symbiotic N-2 fixation can have a central role in nitrogen cycling during tropical forest stand development, with potentially important implications for the ability of tropical forests to sequester CO2.","[Batterman, Sarah A.; Hedin, Lars O.] Princeton Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [van Breugel, Michiel; Hall, Jefferson S.] Smithsonian Trop Res Inst, Panama City, Panama; [Ransijn, Johannes] Wageningen Univ, Ctr Ecosyst Studies, Forest Ecol & Forest Management Grp, NL-6700 AA Wageningen, Netherlands; [Ransijn, Johannes] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Geosci & Nat Resource Management, DK-1958 Frederiksberg C, Denmark; [Craven, Dylan J.] Yale Univ, Sch Forestry & Environm Studies, New Haven, CT 06511 USA","Batterman, SA (reprint author), Princeton Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA.",sbatterm@princeton.edu,"Ransijn, Johannes/D-5324-2015; Craven, Dylan/K-2717-2012","Ransijn, Johannes/0000-0003-0416-2210; Craven, Dylan/0000-0003-3940-833X; van Breugel, Michiel/0000-0003-2778-7803",National Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-0614116]; National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association (NOAA) [NA17RJ262-344]; Cooperative Institute for Climate Science of Princeton University; Carbon Mitigation Initiative of Princeton University; Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute (STRI); HSBC; STRI; Frank Levinson Family Foundation; Motta Family Foundation,"We thank S.

However, similar traits might also evolve convergently in unrelated taxa owing to similar selection pressures(4,5). Adaptive phenotypic convergence is widespread in nature, and recent results from several genes have suggested that this phenomenon is powerful enough to also drive recurrent evolution at the sequence level(6-9). Where homoplasious substitutions do occur these have long been considered the result of neutral processes. However, recent studies have demonstrated that adaptive convergent sequence evolution can be detected in vertebrates using statistical methods that model parallel evolution(9,10), although the extent to which sequence convergence between genera occurs across genomes is unknown. Here we analyse genomic sequence data in mammals that have independently evolved echolocation and show that convergence is not a rare process restricted to several loci but is instead widespread, continuously distributed and commonly driven by natural selection acting on a small number of sites per locus. Systematic analyses of convergent sequence evolution in 805,053 amino acids within 2,326 orthologous coding gene sequences compared across 22 mammals (including four newly sequenced bat genomes) revealed signatures consistent with convergence in nearly 200 loci. Strong and significant support for convergence among bats and the bottlenose dolphin was seen in numerous genes linked to hearing or deafness, consistent with an involvement in echolocation. Unexpectedly, we also found convergence in many genes linked to vision: the convergent signal of many sensory genes was robustly correlated with the strength of natural selection. This first attempt to detect genome-wide convergent sequence evolution across divergent taxa reveals the phenomenon to be much more pervasive than previously recognized.","[Parker, Joe; Tsagkogeorga, Georgia; Cotton, James A.; Rossiter, Stephen J.] Univ London, Sch Biol & Chem Sci, London E1 4NS, England; [Liu, Yuan] BGI Europe, DK-2200 Copenhagen N, Denmark; [Provero, Paolo; Stupka, Elia] Ist Sci San Raffaele, Ctr Translat Genom & Bioinformat, I-20132 Milan, Italy; [Provero, Paolo] Univ Turin, Dept Mol Biotechnol & Hlth Sci, I-10126 Turin, Italy","Parker, J (reprint author), Univ London, Sch Biol & Chem Sci, London E1 4NS, England.",j.d.parker@qmul.ac.uk; s.j.rossiter@qmul.ac.uk,"Cotton, James/B-8806-2008","Cotton, James/0000-0001-5475-3583; Parker, Joe/0000-0003-3777-2269; Stupka, Elia/0000-0003-3154-4011",Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research [BB/H017178/1],"We are grateful to K.

Megakaryocytes in the bone marrow are responsible for the continuous production of platelets in the blood, crucial for preventing bleeding-a common and life-threatening side effect of many cancer therapies-and major efforts are focused at identifying the most suitable cellular and molecular targets to enhance platelet production after bone marrow transplantation or chemotherapy(1). Although it has become clear that distinct HSC subsets exist that are stably biased towards the generation of lymphoid or myeloid blood cells(2-4), we are yet to learn whether other types of lineage-biased HSC exist or understand their inter-relationships and how differently lineage-biased HSCs are generated and maintained. The functional relevance of notable phenotypic and molecular similarities between megakaryocytes and bone marrow cells with an HSC cell-surface phenotype(5-8) remains unclear. Here we identify and prospectively isolate a molecularly and functionally distinct mouse HSC subset primed for platelet-specific gene expression, with enhanced propensity for short-and long-term reconstitution of platelets. Maintenance of platelet-biased HSCs crucially depends on thrombopoietin, the primary extrinsic regulator of platelet development(9). Platelet-primed HSCs also frequently have a long-term myeloid lineage bias, can self-renew and give rise to lymphoid-biased HSCs. These findings show that HSC subtypes can be organized into a cellular hierarchy, with platelet-primed HSCs at the apex. They also demonstrate that molecular and functional priming for platelet development initiates already in a distinct HSC population. The identification of a platelet-primed HSC population should enable the rational design of therapies enhancing platelet output.","[Sanjuan-Pla, Alejandra; Moore, Susan; Nerlov, Claus] Univ Edinburgh, Inst Stem Cell Res, Edinburgh EH9 16UU, Midlothian, Scotland; [Sanjuan-Pla, Alejandra; Moore, Susan; Nerlov, Claus] Univ Edinburgh, MRC Ctr Regenerat Med, Edinburgh EH9 16UU, Midlothian, Scotland; [Sanjuan-Pla, Alejandra; Moore, Susan; Carella, Cintia; Nerlov, Claus] EMBL Mouse Biol Program, I-00015 Monterotondo, Italy; [Macaulay, Iain C.; Jensen, Christina T.; Woll, Petter S.; Luis, Tiago C.; Mead, Adam; Matsuoka, Sahoko; Jones, Tiphaine Bouriez; Chowdhury, Onima; Stenson, Laura; Lutteropp, Michael; Green, Joanna C.

However, the meningococcus is primarily an obligate commensal of the human nasopharynx, and it is unclear why the bacterium has evolved exquisite mechanisms to avoid host immunity. Here we demonstrate that mechanisms of meningococcal immune evasion and resistance against complement increase in response to an increase in ambient temperature. We have identified three independent RNA thermosensors located in the 5' untranslated regions of genes necessary for capsule biosynthesis, the expression of factor H binding protein, and sialylation of lipopolysaccharide, which are essential for meningococcal resistance against immune killing(1,2). Therefore increased temperature (which occurs during inflammation) acts as a 'danger signal' for the meningococcus, enhancing its defence against human immune killing. Infection with viral pathogens, such as influenza, leads to inflammation in the nasopharynx with an increased temperature and recruitment of immune effectors(3,4). Thermoregulation of immune defence could offer an adaptive advantage to the meningococcus during co-infection with other pathogens, and promote the emergence of virulence in an otherwise commensal bacterium.","[Loh, Edmund; Tracy, Alexander; Tang, Christoph M.] Univ Oxford, Sir William Dunn Sch Pathol, Oxford OX1 3RE, England; [Kugelberg, Elisabeth; Zhang, Qian; Gollan, Bridget; Ewles, Helen; Pelicic, Vladimir; Tang, Christoph M.] Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Ctr Mol Microbiol & Infect, London SW7 2AZ, England; [Chalmers, Ronald] Univ Nottingham, Sch Biomed Sci, Nottingham NG7 2NR, England","Tang, CM (reprint author), Univ Oxford, Sir William Dunn Sch Pathol, Sir Parks Rd, Oxford OX1 3RE, England.",christoph.tang@path.ox.ac.uk,"Pelicic, Vladimir/N-3755-2017","Loh, Edmund/0000-0001-7050-566X; Kugelberg, Elisabeth/0000-0002-8302-3595; Tracy, Alexander/0000-0003-4109-3568; Pelicic, Vladimir/0000-0002-9456-4995",Wellcome Trust; Medical Research Council; Oxford Martin School; Swedish Research Council [524-2010-6726]; EMBO,"Work in C.M.T.'s laboratory is funded by Programme Grants from the Wellcome Trust and the Medical Research Council, and by the Oxford Martin School.

Preliminary analyses suggest that the virus is a reassortant of H7, N9 and H9N2 avian influenza viruses, and carries some amino acids associated with mammalian receptor binding, raising concerns of a new pandemic(1,3,4). However, neither the source populations of the H7N9 outbreak lineage nor the conditions for its genesis are fully known(5). Using a combination of active surveillance, screening of virus archives, and evolutionary analyses, here we show that H7 viruses probably transferred from domestic duck to chicken populations in China on at least two independent occasions. We show that the H7 viruses subsequently reassorted with enzootic H9N2 viruses to generate the H7N9 outbreak lineage, and a related previously unrecognized H7N7 lineage. The H7N9 outbreak lineage has spread over a large geographic region and is prevalent in chickens at live poultry markets, which are thought to be the immediate source of human infections. Whether the H7N9 outbreak lineage has, or will, become enzootic in China and neighbouring regions requires further investigation. The discovery here of a related H7N7 influenza virus in chickens that has the ability to infect mammals experimentally, suggests that H7 viruses may pose threats beyond the current outbreak. The continuing prevalence of H7 viruses in poultry could lead to the generation of highly pathogenic variants and further sporadic human infections, with a continued risk of the virus acquiring human-to-human transmissibility.","[Lam, Tommy Tsan-Yuk; Wang, Jia; Shen, Yongyi; Ma, Chi; Li, Lifeng; Hong, Wenshan; Liang, Huyi; Ou, Zhihua; Liu, Yongmei; Smith, David K.; Leung, Gabriel M.; Zhu, Huachen; Guan, Yi] Shantou Univ, Coll Med, Joint Influenza Res Ctr SUMC HKU, Shantou 515041, Peoples R China; [Lam, Tommy Tsan-Yuk; Zhou, Boping; Duan, Lian; Chen, Xinchun; Li, Lifeng; Chai, Yujuan; Liang, Huyi; Ou, Zhihua; Poon, Leo L.

Blood eosinophils demonstrate circadian cycling, as described over 80 years ago(1), and are abundant in the healthy gastrointestinal tract. Although a cytokine, interleukin (IL)-5, and chemokines such as eotaxins mediate eosinophil development and survival(2), and tissue recruitment(3), respectively, the processes underlying the basal regulation of these signals remain unknown. Here we show that serum IL-5 levels are maintained by long-lived type 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2) resident in peripheral tissues. ILC2 cells secrete IL-5 constitutively and are induced to co-express IL-13 during type 2 inflammation, resulting in localized eotaxin production and eosinophil accumulation. In the small intestine where eosinophils and eotaxin are constitutive(4), ILC2 cells co-express IL-5 and IL-13; this co-expression is enhanced after caloric intake. The circadian synchronizer vasoactive intestinal peptide also stimulates ILC2 cells through the VPAC2 receptor to release IL-5, linking eosinophil levels with metabolic cycling. Tissue ILC2 cells regulate basal eosinophilopoiesis and tissue eosinophil accumulation through constitutive and stimulated cytokine expression, and this dissociated regulation can be tuned by nutrient intake and central circadian rhythms.","[Nussbaum, Jesse C.; Van Dyken, Steven J.; von Moltke, Jakob; Chawla, Ajay; Liang, Hong-Erh; Locksley, Richard M.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Med, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; [Cheng, Laurence E.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Pediat, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; [Mohapatra, Alexander; Locksley, Richard M.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Microbiol, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; [Mohapatra, Alexander; Locksley, Richard M.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Immunol, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; [Molofsky, Ari B.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Lab Med, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; [Thornton, Emily E.; Krummel, Matthew F.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Pathol, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; [Chawla, Ajay] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Physiol, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; [Chawla, Ajay] Univ Calif San Francisco, Cardiovasc Res Inst, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; [Locksley, Richard M.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Howard Hughes Med Inst, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA","Locksley, RM (reprint author), Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Med, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA.",locksley@medicine.ucsf.edu,,"Thornton, Emily/0000-0002-0068-2502","NIH [AI026918, AI030663, AI078869, HL107202, AI007641, AI007334]; Diabetes Endocrinology Research Center [DK063720]; Howard Hughes Medical Institute; Sandler Asthma Basic Research Center at the University of California San Francisco","We thank the NIH Tetramer Core Facility for reagents, B.

Although it is well established that Uhrf1 (ubiquitin-like with PHD and ring finger domains 1; also known as Np95 and ICBP90) specifically binds to hemi-methylated DNA through its SRA (SET and RING finger associated) domain and has an essential role in maintenance of DNA methylation by recruiting Dnmt1 to hemi-methylated DNA sites(6-10), the mechanism by which Uhrf1 coordinates the maintenance of DNA methylation and DNA replication is largely unknown. Here we show that Uhrf1-dependent histone H3 ubiquitylation has a prerequisite role in the maintenance DNA methylation. Using Xenopus egg extracts, we successfully reproduce maintenance DNA methylation in vitro. Dnmt1 depletion results in a marked accumulation of Uhrf1-dependent ubiquitylation of histone H3 at lysine 23. Dnmt1 preferentially associates with ubiquitylated H3 in vitro though a region previously identified as a replication foci targeting sequence(11). The RING finger mutant of Uhrf1 fails to recruit Dnmt1 to DNA replication sites and maintain DNA methylation in mammalian cultured cells. Our findings represent the first evidence, to our knowledge, of the mechanistic link between DNA methylation and DNA replication through histone H3 ubiquitylation.","[Nishiyama, Atsuya; Yamaguchi, Luna; Johmura, Yoshikazu; Nakanishi, Makoto] Nagoya City Univ, Grad Sch Med Sci, Dept Cell Biol, Mizuho Ku, Nagoya, Aichi 4678601, Japan; [Sharif, Jafar; Koseki, Haruhiko] RIKEN Ctr Integrat Med Sci, Tsurumi Ku, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2300045, Japan; [Kawamura, Takeshi; Kodama, Tatsuhiko] Univ Tokyo, RCAST, Lab Syst Biol & Med, Meguro Ku, Tokyo 1538904, Japan; [Nakanishi, Keiko] Aichi Human Serv Ctr, Inst Dev Res, Dept Perinatol, Kasugai, Aichi 4800392, Japan; [Shimamura, Shintaro] Akita Univ, Grad Sch Med, Dept Mol Med & Biochem, Akita 0108543, Japan; [Arita, Kyohei] Yokohama City Univ, Grad Sch Med Life Sci, Tsurumi Ku, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2300045, Japan; [Ishikawa, Fuyuki] Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Biostudies, Dept Gene Mech, Sakyo Ku, Kyoto 6068501, Japan","Nakanishi, M (reprint author), Nagoya City Univ, Grad Sch Med Sci, Dept Cell Biol, Mizuho Ku, 1 Kawasumi,Mizuho Cho, Nagoya, Aichi 4678601, Japan.",anishiya@med.nagoya-cu.ac.jp; mkt-naka@med.nagoya-cu.ac.jp,"Koseki, Haruhiko/I-3825-2014; Nishiyama, Atsuya/D-7894-2017","Koseki, Haruhiko/0000-0001-8424-5854; Nishiyama, Atsuya/0000-0002-8416-3776",MEXT Japan; Japan Society for the Promotion of Science,"We are grateful to T.

Defects in ciliogenesis can lead to a group of genetic syndromes known as ciliopathies(1-3). However, the regulatory mechanisms of primary ciliogenesis in normal and cancer cells are incompletely understood. Here we demonstrate that autophagic degradation of a ciliopathy protein, OFD1 (oral-facial-digital syndrome 1), at centriolar satellites promotes primary cilium biogenesis. Autophagy is a catabolic pathway in which cytosol, damaged organelles and protein aggregates are engulfed in autophagosomes and delivered to lysosomes for destruction(4). We show that the population of OFD1 at the centriolar satellites is rapidly degraded by autophagy upon serum starvation. In autophagy-deficient Atg5 or Atg3 null mouse embryonic fibroblasts, OFD1 accumulates at centriolar satellites, leading to fewer and shorter primary cilia and a defective recruitment of BBS4 (Bardet-Biedl syndrome 4) to cilia. These defects are fully rescued by OFD1 partial knockdown that reduces the population of OFD1 at centriolar satellites. More strikingly, OFD1 depletion at centriolar satellites promotes cilia formation in both cycling cells and transformed breast cancer MCF7 cells that normally do not form cilia. This work reveals that removal of OFD1 by autophagy at centriolar satellites represents a general mechanism to promote ciliogenesis in mammalian cells. These findings define a newly recognized role of autophagy in organelle biogenesis.","[Tang, Zaiming; Zhong, Qing] Univ Texas SW Med Ctr Dallas, Dept Internal Med, Ctr Autophagy Res, Dallas, TX 75390 USA; [Tang, Zaiming; Zhong, Qing] Univ Texas SW Med Ctr Dallas, Dept Biochem, Dallas, TX 75390 USA; [Tang, Zaiming; Lin, Mary Grace; Zhong, Qing] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mol & Cell Biol, Div Biochem Biophys & Struct Biol, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Tang, Zaiming; Zhu, Muyuan] Zhejiang Univ, Coll Life Sci, State Key Lab Plant Physiol & Biochem, Hangzhou 310058, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Stowe, Timothy Richard; Stearns, Tim] Stanford Univ, Dept Biol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Chen, She] Natl Inst Biol Sci, Beijing 102206, Peoples R China; [Franco, Brunella] Univ Naples Federico II, Dept Translat Med Sci, Med Genet Serv, Naples, Italy; [Franco, Brunella] Telethon Inst Genet & Med TIGEM, Naples, Italy","Zhong, Q (reprint author), Univ Texas SW Med Ctr Dallas, Dept Internal Med, Ctr Autophagy Res, Dallas, TX 75390 USA.",qing.zhong@utsouthwestern.edu,,"FRANCO, Brunella/0000-0001-5588-4569",Polycystic Kidney Disease Foundation; American Cancer Society [RSG-11-274-01-CCG]; National Cancer Institute [CA133228]; Italian Telethon Foundation [TGM11CB3]; EU [241955]; China Scholarship Council,"We thank D.

Using ChIP-exo (chromatin immunoprecipitation with lambda exonuclease digestion followed by high-throughput sequencing), we identify approximately 160,000 transcription initiation complexes across the human K562 genome, and more in other cancer genomes. Only about 5% associate with messenger RNA genes. The remainder associates with non-polyadenylated non-coding transcription. Regardless, Pol II moves into a transcriptionally paused state, and TBP and TFIIB remain at the promoter. Remarkably, the vast majority of locations contain the four core promoter elements-upstream TFIIB recognition element (BREu), TATA, downstream TFIIB recognition element (BREd), and initiator element (INR)-in constrained positions. All but the INR also reside at Pol III promoters, where TBP makes similar contacts. This comprehensive and high-resolution genome-wide detection of the initiation machinery produces a consolidated view of transcription initiation events from yeast to humans at Pol II/III TATA-containing/TATA-less coding and non-coding genes.","[Venters, Bryan J.; Pugh, B.

Genomic techniques based on chromosome conformation capture (3C) assess contacts for millions of loci simultaneously, but do so by averaging chromosome conformations from millions of nuclei. Here we introduce single-cell Hi-C, combined with genome-wide statistical analysis and structural modelling of single-copy X chromosomes, to show that individual chromosomes maintain domain organization at the megabase scale, but show variable cell-to-cell chromosome structures at larger scales. Despite this structural stochasticity, localization of active gene domains to boundaries of chromosome territories is a hallmark of chromosomal conformation. Single-cell Hi-C data bridge current gaps between genomics and microscopy studies of chromosomes, demonstrating how modular organization underlies dynamic chromosome structure, and how this structure is probabilistically linked with genome activity patterns.","[Nagano, Takashi; Schoenfelder, Stefan; Fraser, Peter] Babraham Inst, Nucl Dynam Programme, Cambridge CB22 3AT, England; [Lubling, Yaniv; Yaffe, Eitan; Tanay, Amos] Weizmann Inst Sci, Dept Comp Sci & Appl Math, IL-76100 Rehovot, Israel; [Lubling, Yaniv; Yaffe, Eitan; Tanay, Amos] Weizmann Inst Sci, Dept Regulat Biol, IL-76100 Rehovot, Israel; [Stevens, Tim J.; Laue, Ernest D.] Univ Cambridge, Dept Biochem, Cambridge CB2 1GA, England; [Dean, Wendy] Babraham Inst, Epigenet Programme, Cambridge CB22 3AT, England","Fraser, P (reprint author), Babraham Inst, Nucl Dynam Programme, Cambridge CB22 3AT, England.",e.d.laue@bioc.cam.ac.uk; amos.tanay@weizmann.ac.il; peter.fraser@babraham.ac.uk,,"Laue, Ernest/0000-0002-7476-4148; Yaffe, Eitan/0000-0002-2896-3349; Fraser, Peter/0000-0002-0041-1227",Medical Research Council; Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council; MODHEP project; Israel Science Foundation; Wellcome Trust,"The authors thank I.

The nature of the predominant rate-limiting barrier(s) preventing the majority of cells to successfully and synchronously reprogram remains to be defined. Here we show that depleting Mbd3, a core member of the Mbd3/NuRD (nucleosome remodelling and deacetylation) repressor complex, together with OSKM transduction and reprogramming in naive pluripotency promoting conditions, result in deterministic and synchronized iPS cell reprogramming (near 100% efficiency within seven days from mouse and human cells). Our findings uncover a dichotomous molecular function for the reprogramming factors, serving to reactivate endogenous pluripotency networks while simultaneously directly recruiting the Mbd3/NuRD repressor complex that potently restrains the reactivation of OSKM downstream target genes. Subsequently, the latter interactions, which are largely depleted during early pre-implantation development in vivo, lead to a stochastic and protracted reprogramming trajectory towards pluripotency in vitro. The deterministic reprogramming approach devised here offers a novel platform for the dissection of molecular dynamics leading to establishing pluripotency at unprecedented flexibility and resolution.","[Rais, Yoach; Zviran, Asaf; Geula, Shay; Gafni, Ohad; Chomsky, Elad; Viukov, Sergey; Mansour, Abed AlFatah; Caspi, Inbal; Krupalnik, Vladislav; Zerbib, Mirie; Maza, Itay; Mor, Nofar; Baran, Dror; Weinberger, Leehee; Novershtern, Noa; Hanna, Jacob H.] Weizmann Inst Sci, Dept Mol Genet, IL-76100 Rehovot, Israel; [Jaitin, Diego A.; Lara-Astiaso, David; Blecher-Gonen, Ronnie; Amit, Ido] Weizmann Inst Sci, Dept Immunol, IL-76100 Rehovot, Israel; [Shipony, Zohar; Mukamel, Zohar; Tanay, Amos] Weizmann Inst Sci, Dept Regulat Biol, IL-76100 Rehovot, Israel; [Shipony, Zohar; Mukamel, Zohar; Tanay, Amos] Weizmann Inst Sci, Dept Comp Sci, IL-76100 Rehovot, Israel; [Hagai, Tzachi] Weizmann Inst Sci, Dept Biol Struct, IL-76100 Rehovot, Israel; [Gilad, Shlomit; Amann-Zalcenstein, Daniela] Weizmann Inst Sci, Israel Natl Ctr Personalized Med, IL-76100 Rehovot, Israel","Hanna, JH (reprint author), Weizmann Inst Sci, Dept Mol Genet, IL-76100 Rehovot, Israel.",noa.novershtern@weizmann.ac.il; jacob.hanna@weizmann.ac.il,"HANNA, JACOB/K-1339-2012","HANNA, JACOB/0000-0003-2042-9974; Novershtern, Noa/0000-0002-2244-6877; Geula, Shay/0000-0001-8111-4410; Mansour, Abed AlFatah/0000-0001-9025-6998","Leona M. and Harry B.

Here we demonstrate a quantum nonlinear medium inside which individual photons travel as massive particles with strong mutual attraction, such that the propagation of photon pairs is dominated by a two-photon bound state(4-7). We achieve this through dispersive coupling of light to strongly interacting atoms in highly excited Rydberg states. We measure the dynamical evolution of the two-photon wave-function using time-resolved quantum state tomography, and demonstrate a conditional phase shift(8) exceeding one radian, resulting in polarization-entangled photon pairs.

Identifying signatures of magnon bound states has so far remained the subject of intense theoretical research(2-5), and their detection has proved challenging for experiments. Ultracold atoms offer an ideal setting in which to find such bound states by tracking the spin dynamics with single-spin and single-site resolution(6,7) following a local excitation(8). Here we use in situ correlation measurements to observe two-magnon bound states directly in a one-dimensional Heisenberg spin chain comprising ultracold bosonic atoms in an optical lattice. We observe the quantum dynamics of free and bound magnon states through time-resolved measurements of two spin impurities. The increased effective mass of the compound magnon state results in slower spin dynamics as compared to single-magnon excitations. We also determine the decay time of bound magnons, which is probably limited by scattering on thermal fluctuations in the system. Our results provide a new way of studying fundamental properties of quantum magnets and, more generally, properties of interacting impurities in quantum many-body systems.","[Fukuhara, Takeshi; Schauss, Peter; Endres, Manuel; Hild, Sebastian; Cheneau, Marc; Bloch, Immanuel; Gross, Christian] Max Planck Inst Quantum Opt, D-85748 Garching, Germany; [Cheneau, Marc] Univ Paris 11, CNRS, Inst Opt, Lab Charles Fabry,Grad Sch, F-91127 Palaiseau, France; [Bloch, Immanuel] Univ Munich, Fak Phys, D-80799 Munich, Germany","Fukuhara, T (reprint author), Max Planck Inst Quantum Opt, D-85748 Garching, Germany.",takeshi.fukuhara@mpq.mpg.de,"Bloch, Immanuel/G-3174-2010; Fukuhara, Takeshi/A-6254-2014; Cheneau, Marc/O-9312-2014; Gross, Christian/P-5475-2014","Bloch, Immanuel/0000-0002-0679-4759; Fukuhara, Takeshi/0000-0002-6702-9882; Cheneau, Marc/0000-0001-7261-566X; Gross, Christian/0000-0003-2292-5234; Schauss, Peter/0000-0002-8505-5195",MPG; DFG; EU; JSPS,"We thank H.

The sensitivity of each LSPR mode, whose spatial distribution and resonant energy depend on the nanoparticle structure, composition and environment, has given rise to many potential photonic, optoelectronic, catalytic, photovoltaic, and gas-and bio-sensing applications(1-3). However, the precise interplay between the three-dimensional (3D) nanoparticle structure and the LSPRs is not always fully understood and a spectrally sensitive 3D imaging technique is needed to visualize the excitation on the nanometre scale. Here we show that 3D images related to LSPRs of an individual silver nanocube can be reconstructed through the application of electron energy-loss spectrum imaging(4), mapping the excitation across a range of orientations, with a novel combination of non-negative matrix factorization(5,6), compressed sensing(7,8) and electron tomography(9). Our results extend the idea of substrate-mediated hybridization of dipolar and quadrupolar modes predicted by theory, simulations, and electron and optical spectroscopy(10-12), and provide experimental evidence of higher-energy mode hybridization.

The ability to pass back and forth through the phase transformation many times without degradation of properties (termed 'reversibility') is critical for these applications. Materials tuned to satisfy a certain geometric compatibility condition have been shown(2,5-14) to exhibit high reversibility, measured by low hysteresis and small migration of transformation temperature under cycling(6,9,12,15). Recently, stronger compatibility conditions called the 'cofactor conditions'(5,15) have been proposed theoretically to achieve even better reversibility. Here we report the enhanced reversibility and unusual microstructure of the first martensitic material, Zn45Au30Cu25, that closely satisfies the cofactor conditions. We observe four striking properties of thismaterial. (1) Despite a transformation strain of 8%, the transformation temperature shifts less than 0.5 degrees C after more than 16,000 thermal cycles. For comparison, the transformation temperature of the ubiquitous NiTi alloy shifts up to 20 degrees C in the first 20 cycles(9,16). (2) The hysteresis remains approximately 2 degrees C during this cycling. For comparison, the hysteresis of the NiTi alloy is up to 70 degrees C (refs 9, 12). (3) The alloy exhibits an unusual riverine microstructure of martensite not seen in other martensites. (4) Unlike that of typical polycrystal martensites, its microstructure changes drastically in consecutive transformation cycles, whereas macroscopic properties such as transformation temperature and latent heat are nearly reproducible. These results promise a concrete strategy for seeking ultra-reliable martensitic materials.","[Song, Yintao; Chen, Xian; Dabade, Vivekanand; Shield, Thomas W.; James, Richard D.] Univ Minnesota, Dept Aerosp Engn & Mech, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA","James, RD (reprint author), Univ Minnesota, Dept Aerosp Engn & Mech, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA.",james@umn.edu,,"Shield, Thomas W/0000-0002-0662-7029","MURI [FA9550-12-1-0458, W911NF-07-1-0410]; NSF-PIRE [OISE-0967140]; Graduate School of the University of Minnesota",We acknowledge the financial support of MURI projects FA9550-12-1-0458 (administered by AFOSR) and W911NF-07-1-0410 (administered by ARO).

More recently, the importance of melting by the ocean has been demonstrated close to the grounding line and near the calving front(3-5). So far, however, no study has reliably quantified the calving flux and the basal mass balance (the balance between accretion and ablation at the ice-shelf base) for the whole of Antarctica. The distribution of fresh water in the Southern Ocean and its partitioning between the liquid and solid phases is therefore poorly constrained. Here we estimate the mass balance components for all ice shelves in Antarctica, using satellite measurements of calving flux and grounding-line flux, modelled ice-shelf snow accumulation rates(6) and a regional scaling that accounts for unsurveyed areas. We obtain a total calving flux of 1,321 +/- 144 gigatonnes per year and a total basal mass balance of -1,454 +/- 174 gigatonnes per year. This means that about half of the ice-sheet surface mass gain is lost through oceanic erosion before reaching the ice front, and the calving flux is about 34 per cent less than previous estimates derived from iceberg tracking(1,2,7). In addition, the fraction of mass loss due to basal processes varies from about 10 to 90 per cent between ice shelves. We find a significant positive correlation between basal mass loss and surface elevation change for ice shelves experiencing surface lowering(8) and enhanced discharge(9).

In the presence of such strong directional selection, alleles enhancing a particular trait are predicted to become fixed within a population, leading to a decrease in the underlying genetic variation(3). However, there is often considerable genetic variation underlying sexually selected traits in wild populations, and consequently, this phenomenon has become a long-discussed issue in the field of evolutionary biology(1,4,5). In wild Soay sheep, large horns confer an advantage in strong intra-sexual competition, yet males show an inherited polymorphism for horn type and have substantial genetic variation in their horn size(6). Here we show that most genetic variation in this trait is maintained by a trade-off between natural and sexual selection at a single gene, relaxin-like receptor 2 (RXFP2). We found that an allele conferring larger horns, Ho+, is associated with higher reproductive success, whereas a smaller horn allele, Ho-P, confers increased survival, resulting in a net effect of overdominance (that is, heterozygote advantage) for fitness at RXFP2. The nature of this trade-off is simple relative to commonly proposed explanations for the maintenance of sexually selected traits, such as genic capture(7,8) ('good genes') and sexually antagonistic selection(5,9). Our results demonstrate that by identifying the genetic architecture of trait variation, we can determine the principal mechanisms maintaining genetic variation in traits under strong selection and explain apparently counter-evolutionary observations.","[Johnston, Susan E.; Gratten, Jacob; Slate, Jon] Univ Sheffield, Dept Anim & Plant Sci, Sheffield S10 2TN, S Yorkshire, England; [Johnston, Susan E.; Berenos, Camillo; Pilkington, Jill G.; Pemberton, Josephine M.] Univ Edinburgh, Inst Evolutionary Biol, Edinburgh EH9 3JT, Midlothian, Scotland; [Gratten, Jacob] Univ Queensland, Queensland Brain Inst, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia; [Clutton-Brock, Tim H.] Univ Cambridge, Dept Zool, Cambridge CB2 3EJ, England","Johnston, SE (reprint author), Univ Edinburgh, Inst Evolutionary Biol, Edinburgh EH9 3JT, Midlothian, Scotland.",Susan.Johnston@ed.ac.uk; j.slate@shef.ac.uk,"Pemberton, Josephine/F-3100-2010; Slate, Jon/D-2925-2012","Slate, Jon/0000-0003-3356-5123; Gratten, Jacob/0000-0003-1293-409X; Johnston, Susan/0000-0002-5623-8902",Natural Environment Research Council (NERC); NERC; European Research Council (ERC); Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council CASE studentship,"We thank the numerous Soay sheep project members and volunteers for collection of data and samples; M.

Undisturbed, this intestinal microbiota provides protection from bacterial infections. Conversely, disruption of the microbiota with oral antibiotics often precedes the emergence of several enteric pathogens(1-4). How pathogens capitalize upon the failure of microbiota-afforded protection is largely unknown. Here we show that two antibiotic-associated pathogens, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (S. typhimurium) and Clostridium difficile, use a common strategy of catabolizing microbiota-liberated mucosal carbohydrates during their expansion within the gut. S. typhimurium accesses fucose and sialic acid within the lumen of the gut in a microbiota-dependent manner, and genetic ablation of the respective catabolic pathways reduces its competitiveness in vivo. Similarly, C. difficile expansion is aided by microbiota-induced elevation of sialic acid levels in vivo. Colonization of gnotobiotic mice with a sialidase-deficient mutant of Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, a model gut symbiont, reduces free sialic acid levels resulting in C. difficile downregulating its sialic acid catabolic pathway and exhibiting impaired expansion. These effects are reversed by exogenous dietary administration of free sialic acid. Furthermore, antibiotic treatment of conventional mice induces a spike in free sialic acid and mutants of both Salmonella and C. difficile that are unable to catabolize sialic acid exhibit impaired expansion. These data show that antibiotic-induced disruption of the resident microbiota and subsequent alteration in mucosal carbohydrate availability are exploited by these two distantly related enteric pathogens in a similar manner. This insight suggests new therapeutic approaches for preventing diseases caused by antibiotic-associated pathogens.","[Ng, Katharine M.; Ferreyra, Jessica A.; Higginbottom, Steven K.; Lynch, Jonathan B.; Kashyap, Purna C.; Gopinath, Smita; Monack, Denise M.; Sonnenburg, Justin L.] Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Dept Microbiol & Immunol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Naidu, Natasha; Choudhury, Biswa] Univ Calif San Diego, Glycobiol Res & Training Ctr, San Diego, CA 92093 USA; [Weimer, Bart C.] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Populat Hlth & Reprod, Davis, CA 95616 USA","Sonnenburg, JL (reprint author), Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Dept Microbiol & Immunol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",jsonnenburg@stanford.edu,,"Gopinath, Smita/0000-0003-3672-3780; Weimer, Bart/0000-0002-7471-1978",NSF [R01-DK085025]; Burroughs Wellcome Fund,"We thank E.

Whether the residual virus that maintains these infections is vulnerable to clearance is a question of central importance to the future management of millions of HIV-infected individuals. We recently reported that approximately 50% of rhesus macaques (RM; Macaca mulatta) vaccinated with SIV protein-expressing rhesus cytomegalovirus (RhCMV/SIV) vectors manifest durable, aviraemic control of infection with the highly pathogenic strain SIV mac239 (ref. 5). Here we show that regardless of the route of challenge, RhCMV/SIV vector-elicited immune responses control SIV mac239 after demonstrable lymphatic and haematogenous viral dissemination, and that replication-competent SIV persists in several sites for weeks to months. Over time, however, protected RM lost signs of SIV infection, showing a consistent lack of measurable plasma-or tissue-associated virus using ultrasensitive assays, and a loss of T-cell reactivity to SIV determinants not in the vaccine. Extensive ultrasensitive quantitative PCR and quantitative PCR with reverse transcription analyses of tissues from RhCMV/SIV vector-protected RM necropsied 69-172 weeks after challenge did not detect SIV RNA or DNA sequences above background levels, and replication-competent SIV was not detected in these RM by extensive co-culture analysis of tissues or by adoptive transfer of 60 million haematolymphoid cells to naive RM. These data provide compelling evidence for progressive clearance of a pathogenic lentiviral infection, and suggest that some lentiviral reservoirs may be susceptible to the continuous effector memory T-cell-mediated immune surveillance elicited and maintained by cytomegalovirus vectors.","[Hansen, Scott G.; Ventura, Abigail B.; Hughes, Colette M.; Gilbride, Roxanne M.; Ford, Julia C.; Lewis, Matthew S.; Gilliam, Awbrey N.; Xu, Guangwu; Whizin, Nathan; Burwitz, Benjamin J.; Planer, Shannon L.; Turner, John M.; Legasse, Alfred W.; Axthelm, Michael K.; Nelson, Jay A.; Frueh, Klaus; Sacha, Jonah B.; Picker, Louis J.] Oregon Hlth & Sci Univ, Vaccine & Gene Therapy Inst, Beaverton, OR 97006 USA; [Hansen, Scott G.; Ventura, Abigail B.; Hughes, Colette M.; Gilbride, Roxanne M.; Ford, Julia C.; Lewis, Matthew S.; Gilliam, Awbrey N.; Xu, Guangwu; Whizin, Nathan; Burwitz, Benjamin J.; Planer, Shannon L.; Turner, John M.; Legasse, Alfred W.; Axthelm, Michael K.; Nelson, Jay A.; Frueh, Klaus; Sacha, Jonah B.; Picker, Louis J.] Oregon Hlth & Sci Univ, Oregon Natl Primate Res Ctr, Beaverton, OR 97006 USA; [Piatak, Michael, Jr.; Oswald, Kelli; Shoemaker, Rebecca; Li, Yuan; Estes, Jacob D.; Keele, Brandon F.; Lifson, Jeffrey D.] SAIC Frederick Inc, AIDS & Canc Virus Program, Frederick Natl Lab, Frederick, MD 21702 USA; [Edlefsen, Paul T.] Fred Hutchinson Canc Res Ctr, Stat Ctr HIV AIDS Res & Prevent, Vaccine & Infect Dis Div, Seattle, WA 98109 USA","Lifson, JD (reprint author), SAIC Frederick Inc, AIDS & Canc Virus Program, Frederick Natl Lab, Frederick, MD 21702 USA.",lifsonj@mail.nih.gov; pickerl@ohsu.edu,,,"AIDS Vaccine Research in Nonhuman Primates Consortium of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) [U19 AI095985]; NIAID [RO1 AI060392, R37 AI054292, P01 AI094417, U19 AI096109]; Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation; International AIDS Vaccine Initiative (IAVI); US Agency for International Development (USAID); National Center for Research Resources [P51OD011092]; National Cancer Institute [HHSN261200800001E]","This work was supported by the AIDS Vaccine Research in Nonhuman Primates Consortium of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID; U19 AI095985), as well as other NIAID grants (RO1 AI060392, R37 AI054292, P01 AI094417 and U19 AI096109); the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation-supported Collaboration for AIDS Vaccine Discovery (CAVD); the International AIDS Vaccine Initiative (IAVI) and its donors, particularly the US Agency for International Development (USAID); the National Center for Research Resources (P51OD011092); and the National Cancer Institute (contract HHSN261200800001E).

How high endothelial venules (HEVs) permit lymphocyte transmigration while maintaining vascular integrity is unknown. Here we report a role for the transmembrane O-glycoprotein podoplanin (PDPN, also known as gp38 and T1 alpha)(6-8) in maintaining HEV barrier function. Mice with postnatal deletion of Pdpn lost HEV integrity and exhibited spontaneous bleeding in mucosal lymph nodes, and bleeding in the draining peripheral lymph nodes after immunization. Blocking lymphocyte homing rescued bleeding, indicating that PDPN is required to protect the barrier function of HEVs during lymphocyte trafficking. Further analyses demonstrated that PDPN expressed on fibroblastic reticular cells(7), which surround HEVs, functions as an activating ligand for platelet C-type lectin-like receptor 2 (CLEC-2, also known as CLEC1B)(9,10). Mice lacking fibroblastic reticular cell PDPN or platelet CLEC-2 exhibited significantly reduced levels of VE-cadherin (also known as CDH5), which is essential for overall vascular integrity(11,12), on HEVs. Infusion of wild-type platelets restored HEV integrity in Clec-2-deficient mice. Activation of CLEC-2 induced release of sphingosine-1-phosphate(13,14) from platelets, which promoted expression of VE-cadherin on HEVs ex vivo. Furthermore, draining peripheral lymph nodes of immunized mice lacking sphingosine-1-phosphate had impaired HEV integrity similar to Pdpn- and Clec-2-deficient mice. These data demonstrate that local sphingosine-1-phosphate release after PDPN-CLEC-2-mediated platelet activation is critical for HEV integrity during immune responses.","[Herzog, Brett H.; Fu, Jianxin; McDaniel, J.

Chromosome alignment fosters faithful segregation through the formation of bi-oriented attachments of kinetochores to spindle microtubules. Notably, numerous kinetochore-microtubule (k-MT) attachment errors are present in early mitosis (prometaphase) 1, and the persistence of those errors is the leading cause of chromosome mis-segregation in aneuploid human tumour cells that continually mis-segregate whole chromosomes and display chromosomal instability(2-7). How robust error correction is achieved in prometaphase to ensure error-free mitosis remains unknown. Here we show that k-MT attachments in prometaphase cells are considerably less stable than in metaphase cells. The switch to more stable k-MT attachments in metaphase requires the proteasome-dependent destruction of cyclin A in prometaphase. Persistent cyclin A expression prevents k-MT stabilization even in cells with aligned chromosomes. By contrast, k-MTs are prematurely stabilized in cyclin-A-deficient cells. Consequently, cells lacking cyclin A display higher rates of chromosome mis-segregation. Thus, the stability of k-MT attachments increases decisively in a coordinated fashion among all chromosomes as cells transit from prometaphase to metaphase. Cyclin A creates a cellular environment that promotes microtubule detachment from kinetochores in prometaphase to ensure efficient error correction and faithful chromosome segregation.","[Kabeche, Lilian; Compton, Duane A.] Geisel Sch Med Dartmouth, Dept Biochem, Hanover, NH 03755 USA; [Kabeche, Lilian; Compton, Duane A.] Norris Cotton Canc Ctr, Lebanon, NH 03756 USA","Compton, DA (reprint author), Geisel Sch Med Dartmouth, Dept Biochem, Hanover, NH 03755 USA.",duane.a.compton@dartmouth.edu,,"Compton, Duane/0000-0002-4445-9118","National Institutes of Health [GM51542, GM008704]; John H.

Their mechanism of action involves transitions between extracellular (outward)-facing and intracellular (inward)-facing conformations, whereby substrate binding sites become accessible to either side of the membrane(2). This process has been proposed to entail transmembrane movements of three discrete transport domains within a trimeric scaffold(3). Using single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer (smFRET) imaging(4), we have directly observed large-scale transport domain movements in a bacterial homologue of glutamate transporters. We find that individual transport domains alternate between periods of quiescence and periods of rapid transitions, reminiscent of bursting patterns first recorded in single ion channels using patch-clamp methods(5,6). We propose that the switch to the dynamic mode in glutamate transporters is due to separation of the transport domain from the trimeric scaffold, which precedes domain movements across the bilayer. This spontaneous dislodging of the substrate-loaded transport domain is approximately 100-fold slower than subsequent transmembrane movements and may be rate determining in the transport cycle.","[Akyuz, Nurunisa; Altman, Roger B.; Blanchard, Scott C.; Boudker, Olga] Weill Cornell Med Coll, Dept Physiol & Biophys, New York, NY 10064 USA","Blanchard, SC (reprint author), Weill Cornell Med Coll, Dept Physiol & Biophys, 1300 York Ave, New York, NY 10064 USA.",scb2005@med.cornell.edu; olb2003@med.cornell.edu,"Blanchard, Scott/A-5804-2009","Blanchard, Scott/0000-0003-2717-9365; Akyuz, Nurunisa/0000-0002-6340-1915","National Institute of Health [5U54GM087519, R01NS064357]","We would like to thank D.

EAATs fulfil an important role in neuronal signal transmission by clearing the excitatory neurotransmitters from the synaptic cleft after depolarization of the postsynaptic neuron. An intensively studied model system for understanding the transport mechanism of EAATs is the archaeal aspartate transporter Glt(Ph)(2-6). Each subunit in the homotrimeric Glt(Ph) supports the coupled translocation of one aspartate molecule and three Na+ ions(2) as well as an uncoupled flux of Cl- ions(7). Recent crystal structures of Glt(Ph)(3,5,6,8) revealed three possible conformations for the subunits, but it is unclear whether the motions of individual subunits are coordinated to support transport. Here, we report the direct observation of conformational dynamics in individual Glt(Ph) trimers embedded in the membrane by applying single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET). By analysing the transporters in a lipid bilayer instead of commonly used detergent micelles, we achieve conditions that approximate the physiologically relevant ones. From the kinetics of FRET level transitions we conclude that the three Glt(Ph) subunits undergo conformational changes stochastically and independently of each other.","[Erkens, Guus B.; Hanelt, Inga; Goudsmits, Joris M.

Because these multifarious compounds are notoriously difficult to synthesize, they are usually produced by microbial fermentation. During the past two decades, an impressive body of knowledge on modular PKSs(2,3) has been gathered that not only provides detailed insight into the biosynthetic pathways but also allows the rational engineering of enzymatic processing lines to yield structural analogues(4,5). Notably, a hallmark of all PKS modules studied so far is the head-to-tail fusion of acyl and malonyl building blocks, which leads to linear backbones. Yet, structural diversity is limited by this uniform assembly mode. Here we demonstrate a new type of PKS module from the endofungal bacterium Burkholderia rhizoxinica that catalyses a Michael-type acetyl addition to generate a branch in the carbon chain. In vitro reconstitution of the entire PKS module, X-ray structures of a ketosynthase-branching didomain and mutagenesis experiments revealed a crucial role of the ketosynthase domain in branching the carbon chain. We present a trapped intermediary state in which acyl carrier protein and ketosynthase are covalently linked by the branched polyketide and suggest a new mechanism for chain alkylation, which is functionally distinct from terpenoid-like beta-branching. For the rice seedling blight toxin rhizoxin, one of the strongest known anti-mitotic agents, the non-canonical polyketide modification is indispensable for phytotoxic and anti-tumoral activities. We propose that the formation of related pharmacophoric groups follows the same general scheme and infer a unifying vinylogous branching reaction for PKS modules with a ketosynthase-branching-acyl-carrier-protein architecture. This study unveils the structure and function of a new PKS module that broadens the biosynthetic scope of polyketide biosynthesis and sets the stage for rationally creating structural diversity.","[Bretschneider, Tom; Heine, Daniel; Winkler, Robert; Busch, Benjamin; Kusebauch, Bjoern; Hertweck, Christian] Leibniz Inst Nat Prod Res & Infect Biol HKI, Dept Biomol Chem, D-07745 Jena, Germany; [Heim, Joel B.; Stehle, Thilo; Zocher, Georg] Univ Tubingen, Interfac Inst Biochem, D-72076 Tubingen, Germany; [Stehle, Thilo] Vanderbilt Univ, Sch Med, Dept Pediat, Nashville, TN 37232 USA; [Hertweck, Christian] Univ Jena, Chair Nat Prod Chem, D-07737 Jena, Germany","Hertweck, C (reprint author), Leibniz Inst Nat Prod Res & Infect Biol HKI, Dept Biomol Chem, D-07745 Jena, Germany.",georg.zocher@uni-tuebingen.de; christian.hertweck@hki-jena.de,"Hertweck, Christian/G-1896-2014; Winkler, Robert/A-1500-2009; Heim, Joel Benjamin/K-3615-2016","Hertweck, Christian/0000-0002-0367-337X; Winkler, Robert/0000-0001-6732-1958; Heim, Joel Benjamin/0000-0001-9702-9480",DFG [SFB 766]; Studienstiftung des Deutschen Volkes,"We thank A.

Here we use numerical simulations and comparison with the geologic record to explore a heat-pipe model in which volcanism dominates surface heat transport. These simulations indicate that a cold and thick lithosphere developed as a result of frequent volcanic eruptions that advected surface materials downwards. Declining heat sources over time led to an abrupt transition to plate tectonics. Consistent with model predictions, the geologic record shows rapid volcanic resurfacing, contractional deformation, a low geothermal gradient across the bulk of the lithosphere and a rapid decrease in heat-pipe volcanism after initiation of plate tectonics. The heat-pipe Earth model therefore offers a coherent geodynamic framework in which to explore the evolution of our planet before the onset of plate tectonics.","[Moore, William B.] Hampton Univ, Dept Atmospher & Planetary Sci, Hampton, VA 23668 USA; [Moore, William B.] Natl Inst Aerosp, Hampton, VA 23666 USA; [Webb, A.

Here we report sequencing and deep analysis of messenger RNA and microRNA from lymphoblastoid cell lines of 462 individuals from the 1000 Genomes Project-the first uniformly processed high-throughput RNA-sequencing data from multiple human populations with high-quality genome sequences. We discover extremely widespread genetic variation affecting the regulation of most genes, with transcript structure and expression level variation being equally common but genetically largely independent. Our characterization of causal regulatory variation sheds light on the cellular mechanisms of regulatory and loss-of-function variation, and allows us to infer putative causal variants for dozens of disease-associated loci. Altogether, this study provides a deep understanding of the cellular mechanisms of transcriptome variation and of the landscape of functional variants in the human genome.","[Lappalainen, Tuuli; Giger, Thomas; Padioleau, Ismael; Ongen, Halit; Kilpinen, Helena; Montgomery, Stephen B.; Antonarakis, Stylianos E.; Dermitzakis, Emmanouil T.] Univ Geneva, Sch Med, Dept Genet Med & Dev, CH-1211 Geneva, Switzerland; [Lappalainen, Tuuli; Padioleau, Ismael; Ongen, Halit; Kilpinen, Helena; Antonarakis, Stylianos E.; Dermitzakis, Emmanouil T.] Univ Geneva, iG3, CH-1211 Geneva, Switzerland; [Lappalainen, Tuuli; Padioleau, Ismael; Ongen, Halit; Kilpinen, Helena; Dermitzakis, Emmanouil T.] Swiss Inst Bioinformat, CH-1211 Geneva, Switzerland; [Sammeth, Michael; Griebel, Thasso; Ribeca, Paolo; Beltran, Sergi; Gut, Marta; Kahlem, Katja; Gut, Ivo G.] Ctr Nacl Anal Genom, Barcelona 08028, Catalonia, Spain; [Sammeth, Michael; Friedlaender, Marc R.; Monlong, Jean; Ferreira, Pedro G.; Bertier, Gabrielle; Lizano, Esther; Guigo, Roderic; Estivill, Xavier] CRG, Barcelona 08003, Catalonia, Spain; [Sammeth, Michael; Friedlaender, Marc R.; Monlong, Jean; Ferreira, Pedro G.; Bertier, Gabrielle; Lizano, Esther; Guigo, Roderic; Estivill, Xavier] UPF, Barcelona 08003, Catalonia, Spain; [Sammeth, Michael; Friedlaender, Marc R.; Monlong, Jean; Ferreira, Pedro G.; Lizano, Esther; Guigo, Roderic; Estivill, Xavier] CRG Hosp del Mar Res Inst, Barcelona 08003, Catalonia, Spain; [Friedlaender, Marc R.; Lizano, Esther; Estivill, Xavier] CRG CIBERESP, Barcelona 08003, Catalonia, Spain; ['t Hoen, Peter A.

However, the ubiquitin ligases responsible for catalysing ubiquitin chains that surround intracellular bacteria are poorly understood. The parkin protein is a ubiquitin ligase with a well-established role in mitophagy, and mutations in the parkin gene (PARK2) lead to increased susceptibility to Parkinson's disease. Surprisingly, genetic polymorphisms in the PARK2 regulatory region are also associated with increased susceptibility to intracellular bacterial pathogens in humans, including Mycobacterium leprae and Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi, but the function of parkin in immunity has remained unexplored. Here we show that parkin has a role in ubiquitin-mediated autophagy of M. tuberculosis. Both parkin-deficient mice and flies are sensitive to various intracellular bacterial infections, indicating parkin has a conserved role in metazoan innate defence. Moreover, our work reveals an unexpected functional link between mitophagy and infectious disease.","[Manzanillo, Paolo S.; Watson, Robert O.; Souza, Gianne; Cox, Jeffery S.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Microbiol & Immunol, Program Microbial Pathogenesis & Host Def, San Francisco, CA 94158 USA; [Ayres, Janelle S.] Salk Inst Biol Studies, Immunobiol & Microbial Pathogenesis Lab, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; [Collins, Angela C.; Shiloh, Michael U.] Univ Texas SW Med Ctr Dallas, Dept Internal Med, Dallas, TX 75390 USA; [Rae, Chris S.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mol & Cellular Biol, Div Immunol & Pathogenesis, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Schneider, David S.] Stanford Univ, Dept Microbiol & Immunol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Nakamura, Ken] Univ Calif San Francisco, Gladstone Inst Neurol Dis, San Francisco, CA 94158 USA; [Nakamura, Ken] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Neurol, San Francisco, CA 94158 USA; [Nakamura, Ken] Univ Calif San Francisco, Grad Program Neurosci, San Francisco, CA 94158 USA; [Nakamura, Ken] Univ Calif San Francisco, Grad Program Biomed Sci, San Francisco, CA 94158 USA","Cox, JS (reprint author), Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Microbiol & Immunol, Program Microbial Pathogenesis & Host Def, San Francisco, CA 94158 USA.",jeffery.cox@ucsf.edu,,"Shiloh, Michael/0000-0003-4329-2253","National Institutes of Health [R01 AI081727, P01 AI063302, R01 AI099439]; NINDS [P30NS069496]","We thank N.

During the accretion stage, the system is called a low-mass X-ray binary, and bright X-ray emission is observed. When the rate of mass transfer decreases in the later evolutionary stages, these binaries host a radio millisecond pulsar(4,5) whose emission is powered by the neutron star's rotating magnetic field(6). This evolutionary model is supported by the detection of millisecond X-ray pulsations from several accreting neutron stars(7,8) and also by the evidence for a past accretion disc in a rotation-powered millisecond pulsar(9). It has been proposed that a rotation-powered pulsar may temporarily switch on(10-12) during periods of low mass inflow(13) in some such systems. Only indirect evidence for this transition has hitherto been observed(14-18). Here we report observations of accretion-powered, millisecond X-ray pulsations from a neutron star previously seen as a rotation-powered radio pulsar. Within a few days after a month-long X-ray outburst, radio pulses were again detected. This not only shows the evolutionary link between accretion and rotation-powered millisecond pulsars, but also that some systems can swing between the two states on very short timescales.","[Papitto, A.; Rea, N.; Torres, D.

In ordinary atomic systems, where contact interactions require wavefunction overlap, effective spin interactions on a lattice can be mediated by tunnelling, through a process referred to as superexchange; however, the coupling is relatively weak and is limited to nearest-neighbour interactions(4,5). In contrast, dipolar interactions exist even in the absence of tunnelling and extend beyond nearest neighbours. This allows coherent spin dynamics to persist even for gases with relatively high entropy and low lattice filling. Measured effects of dipolar interactions in ultracold molecular gases have been limited to the modification of inelastic collisions and chemical reactions(6,7). Here we use dipolar interactions of polar molecules pinned in a three-dimensional optical lattice to realize a lattice spin model. Spin is encoded in rotational states of molecules that are prepared and probed by microwaves. Resonant exchange of rotational angular momentum between two molecules realizes a spin-exchange interaction. The dipolar interactions are apparent in the evolution of the spin coherence, which shows oscillations in addition to an overall decay of the coherence. The frequency of these oscillations, the strong dependence of the spin coherence time on the lattice filling factor and the effect of a multipulse sequence designed to reverse dynamics due to two-body exchange interactions all provide evidence of dipolar interactions. Furthermore, we demonstrate the suppression of loss in weak lattices due to a continuous quantum Zeno mechanism(8). Measurements of these tunnelling-induced losses allow us to determine the lattice filling factor independently. Our work constitutes an initial exploration of the behaviour of many-body spin models with direct, long-range spin interactions and lays the groundwork for future studies of many-body dynamics in spin lattices.","[Yan, Bo; Moses, Steven A.; Gadway, Bryce; Covey, Jacob P.; Hazzard, Kaden R.

Digital circuits based on transistors fabricated from carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have the potential to outperform silicon by improving the energy-delay product, a metric of energy efficiency, by more than an order of magnitude. Hence, CNTs are an exciting complement to existing semiconductor technologies(1,2). Owing to substantial fundamental imperfections inherent in CNTs, however, only very basic circuit blocks have been demonstrated. Here we show how these imperfections can be overcome, and demonstrate the first computer built entirely using CNT-based transistors. The CNT computer runs an operating system that is capable of multitasking: as a demonstration, we perform counting and integer-sorting simultaneously. In addition, we implement 20 different instructions from the commercial MIPS instruction set to demonstrate the generality of our CNT computer.

In nature, desaturases and acetylenases are adept at achieving this essential oxidative functionalization reaction, for example during the biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids(3), eicosanoids, gibberellins(4) and carotenoids(5). Alkane-to-alkene conversion almost always involves one or more chemical intermediates in a multistep reaction pathway; these may be either isolable species (such as alcohols or alkyl halides) or reactive intermediates (such as carbocations, alkyl radicals, or sigma-alkyl-metal species). Here we report a desaturation reaction of simple, unactivated alkanes that is mechanistically unique. We show that benzynes are capable of the concerted removal of two vicinal hydrogen atoms from a hydrocarbon. The discovery of this exothermic, net redox process was enabled by the simple thermal generation of reactive benzyne intermediates through the hexadehydro-Diels-Alder cycloisomerization reaction of triyne substrates(6). We are not aware of any single-step, bimolecular reaction in which two hydrogen atoms are simultaneously transferred from a saturated alkane.

Geochemical indications of transient atmospheric oxygenation, however, date back to 2.6-2.7 billion years ago(4-6). Here we examine the distribution of chromium isotopes and redox-sensitive metals in the approximately 3-billion-year-old Nsuze palaeosol and in the near-contemporaneous Ijzermyn iron formation from the Pongola Supergroup, South Africa. We find extensive mobilization of redox-sensitive elements through oxidative weathering. Furthermore, using our data we compute a best minimum estimate for atmospheric oxygen concentrations at that time of 331024 times present levels.

The dominance of this paradigm is reflected in the focus by ecologists and conservation managers on richness and associated occurrence-based measures for understanding drivers of broad-scale diversity patterns and as a biological basis for management(3,4). However, this is changing rapidly, as it is now recognized that not only the number of species but the species present, their phenotypes and the number of individuals of each species are critical in determining the nature and strength of the relationships between species diversity and a range of ecological functions (such as biomass production and nutrient cycling)(5). Integrating these measures should provide a more relevant representation of global biodiversity patterns in terms of ecological functions than that provided by simple species counts. Here we provide comparisons of a traditional global biodiversity distribution measure based on richness with metrics that incorporate species abundances and functional traits. We use data from standardized quantitative surveys of 2,473 marine reef fish species at 1,844 sites, spanning 133 degrees of latitude from all ocean basins, to identify new diversity hotspots in some temperate regions and the tropical eastern Pacific Ocean. These relate to high diversity of functional traits amongst individuals in the community (calculated using Rao's Q(6)), and differ from previously reported patterns in functional diversity and richness for terrestrial animals, which emphasize species-rich tropical regions only(7,8). There is a global trend for greater evenness in the number of individuals of each species, across the reef fish species observed at sites ('community evenness'), at higher latitudes. This contributes to the distribution of functional diversity hotspots and contrasts with well-known latitudinal gradients in richness(2,4). Our findings suggest that the contribution of species diversity to a range of ecosystem functions varies over large scales, and imply that in tropical regions, which have higher numbers of species, each species contributes proportionally less to community-level ecological processes on average than species in temperate regions. Metrics of ecological function usefully complement metrics of species diversity in conservation management, including when identifying planning priorities and when tracking changes to biodiversity values.","[Stuart-Smith, Rick D.; Bates, Amanda E.; Thomson, Russell J.; Stuart-Smith, Jemina F.; Hill, Nicole A.; Soler, German A.; Edgar, Graham J.] Univ Tasmania, Inst Marine & Antarctic Studies, Hobart, Tas 7001, Australia; [Lefcheck, Jonathan S.; Duffy, J.

This has been studied extensively in the primary visual cortex, in which loss of vision to one eye permanently degrades cortical responsiveness to that eye(3,4), a phenomenon known as ocular dominance plasticity (ODP). Cortical inhibition mediates this process(4-6), but the precise role of specific classes of inhibitory neurons in ODP is controversial. Here we report that evoked firing rates of binocular excitatory neurons in the primary visual cortex immediately drop by half when vision is restricted to one eye, but gradually return to normal over the following twenty-four hours, despite the fact that vision remains restricted to one eye. This restoration of binocular-like excitatory firing rates after monocular deprivation results from a rapid, although transient, reduction in the firing rates of fast-spiking, parvalbumin-positive (PV) interneurons, which in turn can be attributed to a decrease in local excitatory circuit input onto PV interneurons. This reduction in PV-cell-evoked responses after monocular lid suture is restricted to the critical period for ODP and appears to be necessary for subsequent shifts in excitatory ODP. Pharmacologically enhancing inhibition at the time of sight deprivation blocks ODP and, conversely, pharmacogenetic reduction of PV cell firing rates can extend the critical period for ODP. These findings define the microcircuit changes initiating competitive plasticity during critical periods of cortical development. Moreover, they show that the restoration of evoked firing rates of layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons by PV-specific disinhibition is a key step in the progression of ODP.","[Kuhlman, Sandra J.; Tring, Elaine; Trachtenberg, Joshua T.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, David Geffen Sch Med, Dept Neurobiol, Los Angeles, CA 90048 USA; [Olivas, Nicholas D.; Ikrar, Taruna; Xu, Xiangmin] Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Anat & Neurobiol, Irvine, CA 92697 USA; [Xu, Xiangmin] Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Biomed Engn, Irvine, CA 92697 USA","Xu, XM (reprint author), Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Anat & Neurobiol, Irvine, CA 92697 USA.",xiangmix@uci.edu; joshua.trachtenberg@gmail.com,"Ikrar, Taruna/I-3357-2014; Kuhlman, Sandra/Q-1211-2015","Kuhlman, Sandra/0000-0003-0450-7282",US National Eye Institute [EY016052]; US National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke [NS078434]; NARSAD,"We thank S.

These complexes comprise at least three proteins (A, B and C), which must assemble to be fully toxic(4). The carboxyterminal region of the C protein is the main cytotoxic component(5), and is poorly conserved between different toxin complexes. A general model of action has been proposed, in which the toxin complex binds to the cell surface via the A protein, is endocytosed, and subsequently forms a pH-triggered channel, allowing the translocation of C into the cytoplasm, where it can cause cytoskeletal disruption in both insect and mammalian cells(5). Toxin complexes have been visualized using single-particle electron microscopy(6,7), but no high-resolution structures of the components are available, and the role of the B protein in the mechanism of toxicity remains unknown. Here we report the three-dimensional structure of the complex formed between the B and C proteins, determined to 2.5 angstrom by X-ray crystallography. These proteins assemble to form an unprecedented, large hollow structure that encapsulates and sequesters the cytotoxic, C-terminal region of the C protein like the shell of an egg. The shell is decorated on one end by a beta-propeller domain, which mediates attachment of the B-C heterodimer to the A protein in the native complex. The structure reveals how C auto-proteolyses when folded in complex with B. The C protein is the first example, to our knowledge, of a structure that contains rearrangement hotspot (RHS) repeats(8), and illustrates a marked structural architecture that is probably conserved across both this widely distributed bacterial protein family and the related eukaryotic tyrosine-aspartate (YD)-repeat-containing protein family, which includes the teneurins(9). The structure provides the first clues about the function of these protein repeat families, and suggests a generic mechanism for protein encapsulation and delivery.","[Busby, Jason N.; Lott, J.

The recent sporadic infections of humans in China with a previously unrecognized avian influenza A virus of the H7N9 subtype (A(H7N9)) have caused concern owing to the appreciable case fatality rate associated with these infections (more than 25%), potential instances of human-to-human transmission(1), and the lack of pre-existing immunity among humans to viruses of this subtype. Here we characterize two early human A(H7N9) isolates, A/Anhui/1/2013 (H7N9) and A/Shanghai/1/2013 (H7N9); hereafter referred to as Anhui/1 and Shanghai/1, respectively. In mice, Anhui/1 and Shanghai/1 were more pathogenic than a control avian H7N9 virus (A/duck/Gunma/466/2011 (H7N9); Dk/GM466) and a representative pandemic 2009 H1N1 virus (A/California/4/2009 (H1N1pdm09); CA04). Anhui/1, Shanghai/1 and Dk/GM466 replicated well in the nasal turbinates of ferrets. In nonhuman primates, Anhui/1 and Dk/GM466 replicated efficiently in the upper and lower respiratory tracts, whereas the replicative ability of conventional human influenza viruses is typically restricted to the upper respiratory tract of infected primates. By contrast, Anhui/1 did not replicate well in miniature pigs after intranasal inoculation. Critically, Anhui/1 transmitted through respiratory droplets in one of three pairs of ferrets. Glycan arrays showed that Anhui/1, Shanghai/1 and A/Hangzhou/1/2013 (H7N9) (a third human A(H7N9) virus tested in this assay) bind to human virus-type receptors, a property that may be critical for virus transmissibility in ferrets. Anhui/1 was found to be less sensitive in mice to neuraminidase inhibitors than a pandemic H1N1 2009 virus, although both viruses were equally susceptible to an experimental antiviral polymerase inhibitor. The robust replicative ability in mice, ferrets and nonhuman primates and the limited transmissibility in ferrets of Anhui/1 suggest that A(H7N9) viruses have pandemic potential.","[Watanabe, Tokiko; Fukuyama, Satoshi; Zhao, Dongming; Tomita, Yuriko; Fujimoto, Naomi; Goto, Kazue; Kawakami, Eiryo; Ishikawa, Izumi; Watanabe, Shinji; Kawaoka, Yoshihiro] Japan Sci & Technol Agcy, ERATO Infect Induced Host Responses Project, Kawaguchi, Saitama 3320012, Japan; [Kiso, Maki; Yamada, Shinya; Yamayoshi, Seiya; Iwatsuki-Horimoto, Kiyoko; Noda, Takeshi; Katsura, Hiroaki; Ito, Mutsumi; Sakai-Tagawa, Yuko; Sugita, Yukihiko; Uraki, Ryuta; Yamaji, Reina; Kawaoka, Yoshihiro] Univ Tokyo, Inst Med Sci, Dept Microbiol & Immunol, Div Virol, Tokyo 1088639, Japan; [Nakajima, Noriko; Hasegawa, Hideki] Natl Inst Infect Dis, Dept Pathol, Shinjuku Ku, Tokyo 1628640, Japan; [Imai, Masaki; Takashita, Emi; Kishida, Noriko; Shirakura, Masayuki; Odagiri, Takato; Tashiro, Masato] Natl Inst Infect Dis, Influenza Virus Res Ctr, Tokyo 2080011, Japan; [Murakami, Shin; Kawaoka, Yoshihiro] Univ Tokyo, Inst Med Sci, Int Res Ctr Infect Dis, Dept Special Pathogens,Minato Ku, Tokyo 1088639, Japan; [Sakoda, Yoshihiro; Shichinohe, Shintaro; Okamatsu, Masatoshi; Tamura, Tomokazu; Kida, Hiroshi] Hokkaido Univ, Grad Sch Vet Med, Dept Dis Control, Microbiol Lab, Sapporo, Hokkaido 0600818, Japan; [McBride, Ryan; de Vries, Robert P.; Paulson, James C.] Scripps Res Inst, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; [Hatta, Masato; Imai, Hirotaka; Eisfeld, Amie J.; Zhong, Gongxun; Fan, Shufang; Ping, Jihui; Maher, Eileen A.; Hanson, Anthony; Neumann, Gabriele; Kawaoka, Yoshihiro] Univ Wisconsin, Sch Vet Med, Dept Pathobiol Sci, Madison, WI 53711 USA; [Watanabe, Shinji] Miyazaki Univ, Dept Vet Sci, Lab Vet Microbiol, Miyazaki 8892192, Japan; [Uchida, Yuko; Saito, Takehiko] Natl Inst Anim Hlth, Influenza & Pr Dis Res Ctr, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3050856, Japan; [Ozawa, Makoto] Kagoshima Univ, Joint Fac Vet Med, Lab Anim Hyg, Kagoshima 8900065, Japan; [Ozawa, Makoto] Kagoshima Univ, Joint Fac Vet Med, Transboundary Anim Dis Ctr, Kagoshima 8900065, Japan; [Kida, Hiroshi] Hokkaido Univ, Res Ctr Zoonosis Control, Sapporo, Hokkaido 0010020, Japan; [Kawaoka, Yoshihiro] Kyoto Univ, Inst Virus Res, Dept Biol Responses, Lab Bioresponses Regulat, Kyoto 6068507, Japan","Kawaoka, Y (reprint author), Japan Sci & Technol Agcy, ERATO Infect Induced Host Responses Project, Kawaguchi, Saitama 3320012, Japan.",kawaokay@svm.vetmed.wisc.edu,"Yukihiko, Sugita/K-9319-2013; Yamayoshi, Seiya/C-1982-2013; de Vries, Robert/K-7212-2013; Shichinohe, Shintaro/C-7937-2017","Shichinohe, Shintaro/0000-0002-8783-2103; Sugita, Yukihiko/0000-0001-6861-4840","Japan Initiative for Global Research Network on Infectious Diseases from the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan; Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare, Japan; ERATO (Japan Science and Technology Agency); NIAID Public Health Service [AI099274, AI058113]; NIAID [HHSN266200700010C]","We thank Y.

The recent human infections with H7N9 virus, totalling over 130 cases with 39 fatalities to date, have been characterized by severe pulmonary disease and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)(2). This is concerning because H7 viruses have typically been associated with ocular disease in humans, rather than severe respiratory disease(3). This recent outbreak underscores the need to better understand the pathogenesis and transmission of these viruses in mammals. Here we assess the ability of A/Anhui/1/2013 and A/Shanghai/1/2013 (H7N9) viruses, isolated from fatal human cases, to cause disease in mice and ferrets and to transmit to naive animals. Both H7N9 viruses replicated to higher titre in human airway epithelial cells and in the respiratory tract of ferrets compared to a seasonal H3N2 virus. Moreover, the H7N9 viruses showed greater infectivity and lethality in mice compared to genetically related H7N9 and H9N2 viruses. The H7N9 viruses were readily transmitted to naive ferrets through direct contact but, unlike the seasonal H3N2 virus, did not transmit readily by respiratory droplets. The lack of efficient respiratory droplet transmission was corroborated by low receptor-binding specificity for human-like alpha 2,6-linked sialosides. Our results indicate that H7N9 viruses have the capacity for efficient replication in mammals and human airway cells and highlight the need for continued public health surveillance of this emerging virus.","[Belser, Jessica A.; Gustin, Kortney M.; Pearce, Melissa B.; Maines, Taronna R.; Zeng, Hui; Pappas, Claudia; Sun, Xiangjie; Carney, Paul J.; Villanueva, Julie M.; Stevens, James; Katz, Jacqueline M.; Tumpey, Terrence M.] Ctr Dis Control & Prevent, Influenza Div, Natl Ctr Immunizat & Resp Dis, Atlanta, GA 30333 USA","Tumpey, TM (reprint author), Ctr Dis Control & Prevent, Influenza Div, Natl Ctr Immunizat & Resp Dis, Atlanta, GA 30333 USA.",tft9@cdc.gov,,,National Institute of General Medical Sciences [GM62116],"We thank the China CDC as part of the WHO Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System (GISRS) for facilitating access to viruses and A.

Direct avian-to-human transmission has been observed for viruses of subtypes A(H5N1), A(H7N2), A(H7N3), A(H7N7), A(H9N2) and A(H10N7) upon human exposure to poultry(2-7), but a lack of sustained human-to-human transmission has prevented these viruses from causing new pandemics. Recently, avian A(H7N9) viruses were transmitted to humans, causing severe respiratory disease and deaths in China(8). Because transmission via respiratory droplets and aerosols (hereafter referred to as airborne transmission) is the main route for efficient transmission between humans, it is important to gain an insight into airborne transmission of the A(H7N9) virus. Here we show that although the A/Anhui/1/2013 A(H7N9) virus harbours determinants associated with human adaptation and transmissibility between mammals, its airborne transmissibility in ferrets is limited, and it is intermediate between that of typical human and avian influenza viruses. Multiple A(H7N9) virus genetic variants were transmitted. Upon ferret passage, variants with higher avian receptor binding, higher pH of fusion, and lower thermostability were selected, potentially resulting in reduced transmissibility. This A(H7N9) virus outbreak highlights the need for increased understanding of the determinants of efficient airborne transmission of avian influenza viruses between mammals.","[Richard, Mathilde; Schrauwen, Eefje J.

At selected gene loci, cohesin complexes have been proposed to arrange these fibres into higher-order structures(1-7), but how important this function is for determining overall chromosome architecture and how the process is regulated are not well understood. Using conditional mutagenesis in the mouse, here we show that depletion of the cohesin-associated protein Wapl(8,9) stably locks cohesin on DNA, leads to clustering of cohesin in axial structures, and causes chromatin condensation in interphase chromosomes. These findings reveal that the stability of cohesin-DNA interactions is an important determinant of chromatin structure, and indicate that cohesin has an architectural role in interphase chromosome territories. Furthermore, we show that regulation of cohesin-DNA interactions by Wapl is important for embryonic development, expression of genes such as c-myc (also known as Myc), and cell cycle progression. In mitosis, Wapl-mediated release of cohesin from DNA is essential for proper chromosome segregation and protects cohesin from cleavage by the protease separase, thus enabling mitotic exit in the presence of functional cohesin complexes.","[Tedeschi, Antonio; Wutz, Gordana; Jaritz, Markus; Schirghuber, Erika; Davidson, Iain Finley; Tang, Wen; Cisneros, David A.; Bhaskara, Venugopal; Nishiyama, Tomoko; Vaziri, Alipasha; Wutz, Anton; Peters, Jan-Michael] Res Inst Mol Pathol IMP, A-1030 Vienna, Austria; [Huet, Sebastien; Wuensche, Annelie; Ellenberg, Jan] European Mol Biol Lab, Cell Biol & Biophys Unit, D-69117 Heidelberg, Germany; [Huet, Sebastien] Inst Genet & Dev Rennes, CNRS, UMR 6290, F-35043 Rennes, France; [Huet, Sebastien] Univ Europeenne Bretagne, Univ Rennes 1, Struct Federat Rech Biosit, Fac Med, F-35043 Rennes, France; [Cisneros, David A.; Vaziri, Alipasha] Univ Vienna, Max F Perutz Labs, A-1030 Vienna, Austria; [Cisneros, David A.; Vaziri, Alipasha] Univ Vienna, Res Platform Quantum Phenomena& Nanoscale Biol Sy, A-1030 Vienna, Austria","Peters, JM (reprint author), Res Inst Mol Pathol IMP, Dr Bohr Gasse 7, A-1030 Vienna, Austria.",jan-michael.peters@imp.ac.at,"Ellenberg, Jan/I-4688-2014; Cisneros, David/B-1141-2012","Ellenberg, Jan/0000-0001-5909-701X; Cisneros, David/0000-0001-9919-0075","European Molecular Biology Organization (EMBO); Japanese Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS); Agence National de la Recherche [JCJC-SVSE2-2011]; European Union [FP7-PEOPLE-2011-CIG]; MFPL VIPS Program (BMWF); MFPL VIPS Program (City of Vienna); Vienna Science and Technology Fund (WWTF) [VRG10-11]; Research Platform Quantum Phenomena and Nanoscale Biological Systems (QuNaBioS); Boehringer Ingelheim; Austrian Science Fund (FWF) [SFB F34, Z196-B20]; Austrian Research Promotion Agency (FFG, Laura Bassi Center for Optimized Structural Studies); Vienna Science and Technology Fund [WWTF LS09-13]; European Community [241548 (MitoSys)]","We dedicate this paper to the memory of B.

Potential causal mechanisms are homologous recombination and error-free postreplication repair (EF-PRR). Homologous recombination repairs damage-induced DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) and single-ended DSBs within replication. To facilitate homologous recombination, the recombinase RAD51 and mediator BRCA2 forma filament on the 3' DNA strand at a break to enable annealing to the complementary sister chromatid(4) while the RecQ helicase, BLM (Bloom syndrome mutated) suppresses crossing over to prevent recombination(5). Homologous recombination also stabilizes(6,7) and restarts(8,9) replication forks without a DSB10,11. EF-PRR bypasses DNA incongruities that impede replication by ubiquitinating PCNA (proliferating cell nuclear antigen) using the RAD6-RAD18 and UBC13-MMS2-RAD5 ubiquitin ligase complexes(12). Some components are common to both homologous recombination and EF-PRR such as RAD51 and RAD18(13,14). Here we delineate two pathways that spontaneously fuse inverted repeats to generate unstable chromosomal rearrangements in wild-type mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells. Gamma-radiation induced a BLM-regulated pathway that selectively fused identical, but not mismatched, repeats. By contrast, ultraviolet light induced a RAD18-dependent pathway that efficiently fused mismatched repeats. Furthermore, TREX2 (a 3'-> 5' exonuclease) suppressed identical repeat fusion but enhanced mismatched repeat fusion, clearly separating these pathways. TREX2 associated with UBC13 and enhanced PCNA ubiquitination in response to ultraviolet light, consistent with it being a novel member of EF-PRR. RAD18 and TREX2 also suppressed replication fork stalling in response to nucleotide depletion. Interestingly, replication fork stalling induced fusion for identical and mismatched repeats, implicating faulty replication as a causal mechanism for both pathways.","[Hu, Lingchuan; Kim, Tae Moon; Son, Mi Young; Kim, Sung-A; Holland, Cory L.; Kim, Dong Hyun; Yew, P.

In humans, their dysfunction has been linked to diseases, such as hypertension, heart failure and epilepsy, and they are well-established drug targets(2). The best understood model system for Na+/H+ antiport is NhaA from Escherichia coli(1,3), for which both electron microscopy and crystal structures are available(4-6). NhaA is made up of two distinct domains: a core domain and a dimerization domain. In the NhaA crystal structure a cavity is located between the two domains, providing access to the ion-binding site from the inward-facing surface of the protein(1,4). Likemany Na+/H+ antiporters, the activity of NhaA is regulated by pH, only becoming active above pH 6.5, at which point a conformational change is thought to occur(7). The only reported NhaA crystal structure so far is of the low pH inactivated form(4). Here we describe the active-state structure of a Na+/H+ antiporter, NapA from Thermus thermophilus, at 3 angstrom resolution, solved from crystals grown at pH7.8. In the NapA structure, the core and dimerization domains are in different positions to those seen in NhaA, and a negatively charged cavity has now opened to the outside. The extracellular cavity allows access to a strictly conserved aspartate residue thought to coordinate ion binding(1,8,9) directly, a role supported hereby molecular dynamics simulations. To alternate access to this ion-binding site, however, requires a surprisingly large rotation of the core domain, some 20 degrees against the dimerization interface. We conclude that despite their fast transport rates of up to 1,500 ions per second(3), Na+/H+ antiporters operate by a two-domain rocking bundle model, revealing themes relevant to secondary-active transporters in general.","[Lee, Chiara; Kang, Hae Joo; Newstead, Simon; Iwata, So; Cameron, Alexander D.; Drew, David] Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Div Mol Biosci, London SW7 2AZ, England; [von Ballmoos, Christoph; Uzdavinys, Povilas; Drew, David] Stockholm Univ, Dept Biochem & Biophys, Ctr Biomembrane Res, SE-10691 Stockholm, Sweden; [Dotson, David L.; Beckstein, Oliver] Arizona State Univ, Dept Phys, Ctr Biol Phys, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA; [Iwata, So; Cameron, Alexander D.] Membrane Prot Lab, Diamond Light Source, Chilton OX11 0DE, Oxon, England; [Iwata, So; Cameron, Alexander D.] Rutherford Appleton Lab, Didcot OX11 0FA, Oxon, England; [Cameron, Alexander D.] Univ Warwick, Sch Life Sci, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England","Cameron, AD (reprint author), Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Div Mol Biosci, London SW7 2AZ, England.",a.cameron@warwick.ac.uk; d.drew@imperial.ac.uk,"Dotson, David/L-7155-2013; Cameron, Alexander/L-7288-2013; Beckstein, Oliver/C-9095-2009","Dotson, David/0000-0001-5879-2942; Beckstein, Oliver/0000-0003-1340-0831; Cameron, Alexander/0000-0001-8776-3518; von Ballmoos, Christoph/0000-0002-4642-6088; Newstead, Simon/0000-0001-7432-2270",Medical Research Council (MRC) [G0900990]; Swedish Research Council; BBSRC [BB/G02325/1]; Wellcome Trust at the Diamond Light Source Limited [062164/Z/00/Z]; Centre for Biomembrane Research (CBR); Swedish Foundation for Strategic Research; XSEDE [TG-MCB120151]; Human Frontiers Science Program (HFSP); Royal Society through the University Research Fellow (URF) scheme,"We are grateful to D.

Here we have developed a human pluripotent stem cell-derived three-dimensional organoid culture system, termed cerebral organoids, that develop various discrete, although interdependent, brain regions. These include a cerebral cortex containing progenitor populations that organize and produce mature cortical neuron subtypes. Furthermore, cerebral organoids are shown to recapitulate features of human cortical development, namely characteristic progenitor zone organization with abundant outer radial glial stem cells. Finally, we use RNA interference and patient-specific induced pluripotent stem cells to model microcephaly, a disorder that has been difficult to recapitulate in mice. We demonstrate premature neuronal differentiation in patient organoids, a defect that could help to explain the disease phenotype.

However, the consequences of the underlying gene-dosage imbalance on adult tissues remain poorly understood. Here we show that in Ts65Dn mice, which are trisomic for 132 genes homologous to genes on human chromosome 21, triplication of Usp16 reduces the self-renewal of haematopoietic stem cells and the expansion of mammary epithelial cells, neural progenitors and fibroblasts. In addition, Usp16 is associated with decreased ubiquitination of Cdkn2a and accelerated senescence in Ts65Dn fibroblasts. Usp16 can remove ubiquitin from histone H2A on lysine 119, a critical mark for the maintenance of multiple somatic tissues. Downregulation of Usp16, either by mutation of a single normal Usp16 allele or by short interfering RNAs, largely rescues all of these defects. Furthermore, in human tissues overexpression of USP16 reduces the expansion of normal fibroblasts and postnatal neural progenitors, whereas downregulation of USP16 partially rescues the proliferation defects of Down's syndrome fibroblasts. Taken together, these results suggest that USP16 has an important role in antagonizing the self-renewal and/or senescence pathways in Down's syndrome and could serve as an attractive target to ameliorate some of the associated pathologies.","[Adorno, Maddalena; Sikandar, Shaheen; Mitra, Siddhartha S.; Kuo, Angera; Di Robilant, Benedetta Nicolis; Haro-Acosta, Veronica; Ouadah, Youcef; Qian, Dalong; Cheshier, Samuel; Clarke, Michael F.] Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Inst Stem Cell Biol & Regenerat Med, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Di Robilant, Benedetta Nicolis] San Raffaele Univ, Int PhD Sch Mol Med, Milan, Italy; [Ouadah, Youcef] Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Program Canc Biol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Quarta, Marco] Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Dept Neurol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Rodriguez, Jacqueline; Garner, Craig C.] Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Dept Psychiat & Behav Sci, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Reddy, Vadiyala M.] Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Dept Pediat, Div Pediat Cardiol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Cheshier, Samuel] Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Dept Neurosurg, Div Pediat Neurosurg, Stanford, CA 94305 USA","Clarke, MF (reprint author), Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Inst Stem Cell Biol & Regenerat Med, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",mfclarke@stanford.edu,,,"California Institute for Regenerative Medicine (CIRM) basic biology award III; National Institutes of Health [CA100225, CA154209]; CIRM bridges fellowship; Fondazione Umberto Veronesi; Breast Cancer Research Program; Department of Defense; The Breast Cancer Research Foundation (BCRF); Stanford Graduate Fellowship; Down Syndrome Research and Treatment Foundation; Fidelity Foundation","We thank S.

InGram-negative bacteria, the beta-barrel assembly machinery (BAM) complex is responsible for the biogenesis of beta-barrel membrane proteins, with homologous complexes found in mitochondria and chloroplasts. Here we describe the structure of BamA, the central and essential component of the BAM complex, from two species of bacteria: Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Haemophilus ducreyi. BamA consists of a large periplasmic domain attached to a 16-strand transmembrane beta-barrel domain. Three structural features shed light on the mechanism by which BamA catalyses beta-barrel assembly. First, the interior cavity is accessible in one BamA structure and conformationally closed in the other. Second, an exterior rim of the beta-barrel has a distinctly narrowed hydrophobic surface, locally destabilizing the outer membrane. And third, the beta-barrel can undergo lateral opening, suggesting a route from the interior cavity in BamA into the outer membrane.","[Noinaj, Nicholas; Kuszak, Adam J.; Chang, Hoshing; Easley, Nicole C.; Buchanan, Susan K.] NIDDK, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Gumbart, James C.] Georgia Inst Technol, Sch Phys, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA; [Lukacik, Petra] Diamond Light Source Ltd, Oxford OX11 0DE, England; [Lithgow, Trevor] Monash Univ, Dept Biochem & Mol Biol, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia","Buchanan, SK (reprint author), NIDDK, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA.",skbuchan@helix.nih.gov,,"Lithgow, Trevor/0000-0002-0102-7884","National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases; NIH [K22-AI100927, R01-GM67887]; Diamond Light Source; ARC Discovery Project [DP120101878]; ARC Linkage International Grant [LX0776170]; US Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences [W-31-109-Eng-38]; US Department of Energy, Basic Energy Sciences, Office of Science [DE-AC02-06CH11357]; Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center [RC2GM093307]","We thank H.

Its electromagnetic emission is thought to be powered by radiatively inefficient accretion of gas from its environment(2), which is a standard mode of energy supply for most galactic nuclei. X-ray measurements have already resolved a tenuous hot gas component from which the black hole can be fed(3). The magnetization of the gas, however, which is a crucial parameter determining the structure of the accretion flow, remains unknown. Strong magnetic fields can influence the dynamics of accretion, remove angular momentum from the infalling gas(4), expel matter through relativistic jets(5) and lead to synchrotron emission such as that previously observed(6-8). Here we report multi-frequency radio measurements of a newly discovered pulsar close to the Galactic Centre(9-12) and show that the pulsar's unusually large Faraday rotation (the rotation of the plane of polarization of the emission in the presence of an external magnetic field) indicates that there is a dynamically important magnetic field near the black hole. If this field is accreted down to the event horizon it provides enough magnetic flux to explain the observed emission-from radio to X-ray wavelengths-from the black hole.","[Eatough, R.

The wafer-based first-generation photovoltaic devices(1) have been followed by thin-film solid semiconductor absorber layers sandwiched between two charge-selective contacts(3) and nanostructured (or mesostructured) solar cells that rely on a distributed heterojunction to generate charge and to transport positive and negative charges in spatially separated phases(4-6). Although many materials have been used in nanostructured devices, the goal of attaining high-efficiency thin-film solar cells in such a way has yet to be achieved(7). Organometal halide perovskites have recently emerged as a promising material for high-efficiency nanostructured devices(8-11). Here we show that nanostructuring is not necessary to achieve high efficiencies with this material: a simple planar heterojunction solar cell incorporating vapour-deposited perovskite as the absorbing layer can have solar-to-electrical power conversion efficiencies of over 15 per cent (as measured under simulated full sunlight). This demonstrates that perovskite absorbers can function at the highest efficiencies in simplified device architectures, without the need for complex nanostructures.","[Liu, Mingzhen; Johnston, Michael B.; Snaith, Henry J.] Univ Oxford, Dept Phys, Clarendon Lab, Oxford OX1 3PU, England","Snaith, HJ (reprint author), Univ Oxford, Dept Phys, Clarendon Lab, Parks Rd, Oxford OX1 3PU, England.",h.snaith1@physics.ox.ac.uk,"Johnston, Michael/B-9813-2008; Snaith, Henry/A-7367-2016","Johnston, Michael/0000-0002-0301-8033; Snaith, Henry/0000-0001-8511-790X",EPSRC; European Research Council (ERC) 'Hyper Project' [279881],"This work was funded by EPSRC and the European Research Council (ERC) 'Hyper Project' number 279881.

Although silver has very desirable physical properties, good relative abundance and low cost, gold nanoparticles have been widely favoured owing to their proved stability and ease of use. Unlike gold, silver is notorious for its susceptibility to oxidation (tarnishing), which has limited the development of important silver-based nanomaterials. Despite two decades of synthetic efforts, silver nanoparticles that are inert or have long-term stability remain unrealized. Here we report a simple synthetic protocol for producing ultrastable silver nanoparticles, yielding a single-sized molecular product in very large quantities with quantitative yield and without the need for size sorting. The stability, purity and yield are substantially better than those for other metal nanoparticles, including gold, owing to an effective stabilization mechanism. The particular size and stoichiometry of the product were found to be insensitive to variations in synthesis parameters. The chemical stability and structural, electronic and optical properties can be understood using first-principles electronic structure theory based on an experimental single-crystal X-ray structure. Although several structures have been determined for protected gold nanoclusters(8-12), none has been reported so far for silver nanoparticles. The total structure of a thiolate-protected silver nanocluster reported here uncovers the unique structure of the silver thiolate protecting layer, consisting of Ag2S5 capping structures. The outstanding stability of the nanoparticle is attributed to a closed-shell 18-electron configuration with a large energy gap between the highest occupied molecular orbital and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital, an ultrastable 32-silver-atom excavated-dodecahedral(13) core consisting of a hollow 12-silver-atom icosahedron encapsulated by a 20-silver-atom dodecahedron, and the choice of protective coordinating ligands. The straightforward synthesis of large quantities of pure molecular product promises to make this class of materials widely available for further research and technology development(14-18).","[Desireddy, Anil; Conn, Brian E.; Guo, Jingshu; Monahan, Bradley M.; Kirschbaum, Kristin; Griffith, Wendell P.; Bigioni, Terry P.] Univ Toledo, Dept Chem, Toledo, OH 43606 USA; [Yoon, Bokwon; Barnett, Robert N.; Landman, Uzi] Georgia Inst Technol, Sch Phys, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA; [Whetten, Robert L.] Georgia Inst Technol, Sch Chem & Biochem, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA; [Whetten, Robert L.] Univ Texas San Antonio, Dept Phys & Astron, San Antonio, TX 78249 USA; [Bigioni, Terry P.] Univ Toledo, Sch Solar & Adv Renewable Energy, Toledo, OH 43606 USA","Bigioni, TP (reprint author), Univ Toledo, Dept Chem, Toledo, OH 43606 USA.",Terry.Bigioni@utoledo.edu,"Yoon, Bokwon/C-5818-2009","Desireddy, Anil/0000-0003-1336-5853","NSF [CBET-0955148, CRIF-0840474]; Wright Center for Photovoltaics Innovation and Commercialization; School of Solar and Advanced Renewable Energy; Office of Basic Energy Sciences of the US Department of Energy [FG05-86ER45234]; Air Force Office of Scientific Research",The work at the University of Toledo was supported by NSF grants CBET-0955148 and CRIF-0840474 as well as by the Wright Center for Photovoltaics Innovation and Commercialization and the School of Solar and Advanced Renewable Energy.

Various mechanisms have been proposed for this hiatus in global warming(3-6), but their relative importance has not been quantified, hampering observational estimates of climate sensitivity. Here we show that accounting for recent cooling in the eastern equatorial Pacific reconciles climate simulations and observations. We present a novel method of uncovering mechanisms for global temperature change by prescribing, in addition to radiative forcing, the observed history of sea surface temperature over the central to eastern tropical Pacific in a climate model. Although the surface temperature prescription is limited to only 8.2% of the global surface, our model reproduces the annual-mean global temperature remarkably well with correlation coefficient r = 0.97 for 1970-2012 (which includes the current hiatus and a period of accelerated global warming). Moreover, our simulation captures major seasonal and regional characteristics of the hiatus, including the intensified Walker circulation, the winter cooling in northwestern North America and the prolonged drought in the southern USA. Our results show that the current hiatus is part of natural climate variability, tied specifically to a La-Nina-like decadal cooling. Although similar decadal hiatus events may occur in the future, the multi-decadal warming trend is very likely to continue with greenhouse gas increase.","[Kosaka, Yu; Xie, Shang-Ping] Univ Calif San Diego, Scripps Inst Oceanog, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Xie, Shang-Ping] Ocean Univ China, Phys Oceanog Lab, Qingdao 266100, Peoples R China; [Xie, Shang-Ping] Ocean Univ China, Ocean Atmosphere Interact & Climate Lab, Qingdao 266100, Peoples R China; [Xie, Shang-Ping] Univ Hawaii Manoa, SOEST, Int Pacific Res Ctr, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA","Xie, SP (reprint author), Univ Calif San Diego, Scripps Inst Oceanog, 9500 Gilman Dr MC206, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.",sxie@ucsd.edu,"Kosaka, Yu/C-2792-2009; Xie, Shang-Ping/C-1254-2009","Xie, Shang-Ping/0000-0002-3676-1325",NSF [ATM-0854365]; National Basic Research Program of China [2012CB955600]; NOAA [NA10OAR4310250],"We thank the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory model developers for making the coupled model version 2.1 available and L.

Mixing in the interior of most of the ocean, however, is thought to have a magnitude just one-tenth of that required to close the global circulation by the downward mixing of less dense waters(4). Some of this deficit is made up by intense near-bottom mixing occurring in restricted 'hot-spots' associated with rough ocean-floor topography(5,6), but it is not clear whether the waters at mid-depth, 1,000 to 3,000 metres, are returned to the surface by cross-densitymixing or by along-density flows(7). Here we show that diapycnal mixing of mid-depth (similar to 1,500 metres) waters undergoes a sustained 20-fold increase as the Antarctic Circumpolar Current flows through the Drake Passage, between the southern tip of South America and Antarctica. Our results are based on an open-ocean tracer release of trifluoromethyl sulphur pentafluoride. We ascribe the increased mixing to turbulence generated by the deep-reaching Antarctic Circumpolar Current as it flows over rough bottom topography in the Drake Passage. Scaled to the entire circumpolar current, the mixing we observe is compatible with there being a southern component to the global overturning in which about 20 sverdrups (1 Sv = 10(6) m(3) s(-1)) upwell in the Southern Ocean, with cross-density mixing contributing a significant fraction (20 to 30 per cent) of this total, and the remainder upwelling along constant-density surfaces. The great majority of the diapycnal flux is the result of interaction with restricted regions of rough ocean-floor topography.","[Watson, Andrew J.; Messias, Marie-Jose; Mackay, Neill; Mills, Benjamin] Univ E Anglia, Sch Environm Sci, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England; [Ledwell, James R.] Woods Hole Oceanog Inst, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA; [King, Brian A.; Garabato, Alberto C.

There is substantial sequence variation in mammalian mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA)(9), and the high mutation rate is counteracted by different mechanisms that decrease maternal transmission of mutated mtDNA(10-13). Despite these protective mechanisms(14), it is becoming increasingly clear that lowlevel mtDNA heteroplasmy is quite common and often inherited in humans(15,16). We designed a series of mouse mutants to investigate the extent to which inherited mtDNA mutations can contribute to ageing. Here we report that maternally transmitted mtDNA mutations can induce mild ageing phenotypes in mice with a wild-type nuclear genome. Furthermore, maternally transmittedmtDNAmutations lead to anticipation of reduced fertility in mice that are heterozygous for themtDNAmutator allele (PolgAwt/mut) and aggravate premature ageing phenotypes inmtDNAmutatormice (PolgAmut/mut). Unexpectedly, a combination of maternally transmitted and somatic mtDNA mutations also leads to stochastic brain malformations. Our findings show that a pre-existing mutation load will not only allow somatic mutagenesis to create a critically high total mtDNA mutation load sooner but will also increase clonal expansionofmtDNA mutations(17) to enhance the normally occurring mosaic respiratory chain deficiency in ageing tissues(18,19). Our findings suggest that maternally transmitted mtDNA mutations may have a similar role in aggravating aspects of normal human ageing.","[Ross, Jaime M.; Coppotelli, Giuseppe; Olson, Lars] Karolinska Inst, Dept Neurosci, S-17177 Stockholm, Sweden; [Stewart, James B.; Mourier, Arnaud; Freyer, Christoph; Lagouge, Marie] Max Planck Inst Biol Ageing, D-50931 Cologne, Germany; [Hagstrom, Erik; Freyer, Christoph; Larsson, Nils-Goran] Karolinska Inst, Dept Lab Med, S-17177 Stockholm, Sweden; [Brene, Stefan] Karolinska Inst, KERIC, Dept Neurobiol Care Sci & Soc, S-17176 Stockholm, Sweden; [Hoffer, Barry J.] Univ Hosp, Case Western Reserve Med Ctr, Dept Neurosurg, Cleveland, OH 44106 USA","Olson, L (reprint author), Karolinska Inst, Dept Neurosci, Retzius Vag 8, S-17177 Stockholm, Sweden.",lars.olson@ki.se; larsson@age.mpg.de,"Stewart, James/C-9633-2011; MOURIER, Arnaud/I-8117-2012","Stewart, James/0000-0002-2902-4968; MOURIER, Arnaud/0000-0002-5413-611X; Freyer, Christoph/0000-0003-0418-1673","ERC [268897, 322744]; Swedish Research Council [K2011-62X-21870-01-6, K2012-62X-03185-42-4]; Swedish Brain Foundation; Swedish Brain Power; Swedish Parkinson Foundation; Karolinska Distinguished Professor Award; Swedish Alzheimer Foundation; National Institutes of Health [AG04418, NS070825]; National Institute on Drug Abuse; National Institutes of Health/Karolinska Institutet Graduate Partnerships Program; Swedish Society for Medical Research; United Mitochondrial Disease Foundation","The study was supported by ERC Advanced Investigator grants (268897 to N.-G.

ELEGANS; PATHWAY; ACTIVATION; EVOLUTION; INFECTION; APOPTOSIS; DAF-16,"DNA damage responses have been well characterized with regard to their cell-autonomous checkpoint functions leading to cell cycle arrest, senescence and apoptosis(1). In contrast, systemic responses to tissue-specific genome instability remain poorly understood. In adult Caenorhabditis elegans worms germ cells undergo mitotic and meiotic cell divisions, whereas somatic tissues are entirely post-mitotic. Consequently, DNA damage checkpoints function specifically in the germ line(2), whereas somatic tissues in adult C. elegans are highly radio-resistant(3). Some DNA repair systems such as global-genome nucleotide excision repair (GG-NER) remove lesions specifically in germ cells(4). Here we investigated how genome instability in germ cells affects somatic tissues in C. elegans. We show that exogenous and endogenous DNA damage in germ cells evokes elevated resistance to heat and oxidative stress. The somatic stress resistance is mediated by the ERK MAP kinase MPK-1 in germ cells that triggers the induction of putative secreted peptides associated with innate immunity. The innate immune response leads to activation of the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) in somatic tissues, which confers enhanced proteostasis and systemic stress resistance. We propose that elevated systemic stress resistance promotes endurance of somatic tissues to allow delay of progeny production when germ cells are genomically compromised.","[Ermolaeva, Maria A.; Segref, Alexandra; Dakhovnik, Alexander; Ou, Hui-Ling; Schneider, Jennifer I.; Hoppe, Thorsten; Schumacher, Bjoern] Univ Cologne, Inst Genet, Cologne Excellence Cluster Cellular Stress Respon, D-50674 Cologne, Germany; [Utermoehlen, Olaf] Univ Cologne, Med Ctr, Inst Med Microbiol Immunol & Hyg, D-50935 Cologne, Germany; [Utermoehlen, Olaf] Univ Cologne, Ctr Mol Med Cologne CMMC, D-50931 Cologne, Germany; [Schumacher, Bjoern] Univ Cologne, D-50937 Cologne, Germany","Schumacher, B (reprint author), Univ Cologne, Inst Genet, Cologne Excellence Cluster Cellular Stress Respon, Zulpicher Str 47A, D-50674 Cologne, Germany.",bjoern.schumacher@uni-koeln.de,"Schumacher, Bjorn/I-4829-2013","Schumacher, Bjorn/0000-0001-6097-5238; Hoppe, Thorsten/0000-0002-4734-9352","US National Institutes of Health (NIH) Office of Research Infrastructure Programs [P40 OD010440]; Mitani laboratory; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) [SFB 670-TP4]; EC Network of Excellence RUBICON [LSHC-CT-2005-018683]; DFG [CECAD, FOR885, SFB635, KFO286, HO2541/4-1, SFB 829, KFO 286]; European Research Council [260383]; Marie Curie [FP7 ITN CodeAge 316354, aDDRess 316390, MARRIAGE 316964, ERG239330]; German-Israeli Foundation [GIF 2213-1935.13/2008, 1104-68.11/2010]; Deutsche Krebshilfe [109453]; BMBF (SyBaCol)","We thank S.

Although therapy-induced senescence (TIS) improves long-term outcomes(3), potentially harmful properties of senescent tumour cells make their quantitative elimination a therapeutic priority. Here we use the Em-myc transgenic mouse lymphoma model in which TIS depends on the H3K9 histone methyltransferase Suv39h1 to show the mechanism and therapeutic exploitation of senescence-related metabolic reprogramming in vitro and in vivo. After senescence-inducing chemotherapy, TIS-competent lymphomas but not TIS-incompetent Suv39h1(-) lymphomas show increased glucose utilization and much higher ATP production. We demonstrate that this is linked to massive proteotoxic stress, which is a consequence of the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) described previously(4-6). SASP-producing TIS cells exhibited endoplasmic reticulum stress, an unfolded protein response (UPR), and increased ubiquitination, thereby targeting toxic proteins for autophagy in an acutely energy-consuming fashion. Accordingly, TIS lymphomas, unlike senescence models that lack a strong SASP response, were more sensitive to blocking glucose utilization or autophagy, which led to their selective elimination through caspase-12-and caspase-3-mediated endoplasmic-reticulum-related apoptosis. Consequently, pharmacological targeting of these metabolic demands on TIS induction in vivo prompted tumour regression and improved treatment outcomes further. These findings unveil the hypercatabolic nature of TIS that is therapeutically exploitable by synthetic lethal metabolic targeting.","[Doerr, Jan R.; Milanovic, Maja; Daebritz, J.

Despite advances in sequence-based microbial profiling and myriad studies defining microbiome composition during health and disease, little is known about the molecular processes used by symbiotic bacteria to stably colonize the gastrointestinal tract. We sought to define how mammals assemble and maintain the Bacteroides, one of the most numerically prominent genera of the human microbiome. Here we find that, whereas the gut normally contains hundreds of bacterial species(2,3), germ-free mice mono-associated with a single Bacteroides species are resistant to colonization by the same, but not different, species. To identify bacterial mechanisms for species-specific saturable colonization, we devised an in vivo genetic screen and discovered a unique class of polysaccharide utilization loci that is conserved among intestinal Bacteroides. We named this genetic locus the commensal colonization factors (ccf). Deletion of the ccf genes in the model symbiont, Bacteroides fragilis, results in colonization defects in mice and reduced horizontal transmission. The ccf genes of B. fragilis are upregulated during gut colonization, preferentially at the colonic surface. When we visualize microbial biogeography within the colon, B. fragilis penetrates the colonic mucus and resides deep within crypt channels, whereas ccf mutants are defective in crypt association. Notably, the CCF system is required for B. fragilis colonization following microbiome disruption with Citrobacter rodentium infection or antibiotic treatment, suggesting that the niche within colonic crypts represents a reservoir for bacteria to maintain long-term colonization. These findings reveal that intestinal Bacteroides have evolved species-specific physical interactions with the host that mediate stable and resilient gut colonization, and the CCF system represents a novel molecular mechanism for symbiosis.","[Lee, S.

T. b. gambiense resists the specific human innate immunity acting against several other tsetsefly-transmitted trypanosome species such as T. b. brucei, the causative agent of nagana disease in cattle. Human immunity to some African trypanosomes is due to two serum complexes designated trypanolytic factors (TLF-1 and -2), which both contain haptoglobin-related protein (HPR) and apolipoprotein LI (APOL1)(2-4). Whereas HPR association with haemoglobin (Hb) allows TLF-1 binding and uptake via the trypanosome receptor TbHpHbR (ref. 5), TLF-2 enters trypanosomes independently of TbHpHbR (refs 4, 5). APOL1 kills trypanosomes after insertion into endosomal/lysosomal membranes(2,6,7). Here we report that T. b. gambiense resists TLFs via a hydrophobic beta-sheet of the T. b. gambiense-specific glycoprotein (TgsGP)(8), which prevents APOL1 toxicity and induces stiffening of membranes upon interaction with lipids. Two additional features contribute to resistance to TLFs: reduction of sensitivity to APOL1 requiring cysteine protease activity, and TbHpHbR inactivation due to a L210S substitution. According to such a multifactorial defence mechanism, transgenic expression of T. b. brucei TbHpHbR in T. b. gambiense did not cause parasite lysis in normal human serum. However, these transgenic parasites were killed in hypohaptoglobinaemic serum, after high TLF-1 uptake in the absence of haptoglobin (Hp) that competes for Hb and receptor binding. TbHpHbR inactivation preventing high APOL1 loading in hypohaptoglobinaemic serum may have evolved because of the overlapping endemic area of T. b. gambiense infection and malaria, the main cause of haemolysis-induced hypohaptoglobinaemia in western and central Africa(9).","[Uzureau, Pierrick; Uzureau, Sophie; Lecordier, Laurence; Fontaine, Frederic; Tebabi, Patricia; Pays, Annette; Felu, Cecile; Poelvoorde, Philippe; Vanhollebeke, Benoit] Univ Libre Bruxelles ULB, IBMM, Lab Mol Parasitol, B-6041 Gosselies, Belgium; [Homble, Fabrice] Univ Libre Brussels, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium; [Grelard, Axelle; Zhendre, Vanessa; Dufourc, Erick J.] Univ Bordeaux, Inst Polytech Bordeaux, Inst Chem & Biol Membranes & Nanoobjects, CNRS,UMR 5248, F-33600 Pessac, France; [Nolan, Derek P.] Trinity Coll Dublin, Sch Biochem & Immunol, Mol Parasitol Grp, Dublin 2, Ireland; [Lins, Laurence; Crowet, Jean-Marc] Univ Liege, Ctr Numer Mol Biophys, B-5030 Gembloux, Belgium; [Moestrup, Soren K.] Univ Aarhus, Dept Biomed, DK-8000 Aarhus, Denmark; [Lyngso, Jeppe; Pedersen, Jan Skov] Univ Aarhus, Interdisciplinary Nanosci Ctr INANO, DK-8000 Aarhus, Denmark; [Lyngso, Jeppe; Pedersen, Jan Skov] Univ Aarhus, Dept Chem, DK-8000 Aarhus, Denmark; [Mottram, Jeremy C.] Univ Glasgow, Wellcome Trust Ctr Mol Parasitol, Glasgow G12 8TA, Lanark, Scotland; [Perez-Morga, David] Univ Libre Brussels, Ctr Microscopy & Mol Imaging CMMI, B-6041 Gosselies, Belgium; [Perez-Morga, David; Pays, Etienne] Univ Libre Brussels, Mol Parasitol Lab, IBMM, B-6041 Gosselies, Belgium; [Pays, Etienne] Univ Libre Brussels, Walloon Excellence Life Sci & Biotechnol WELBIO, B-6041 Gosselies, Belgium","Pays, E (reprint author), Univ Libre Brussels, Walloon Excellence Life Sci & Biotechnol WELBIO, B-6041 Gosselies, Belgium.",epays@ulb.ac.be,"Moestrup, Soren Kragh/A-1403-2014; Pedersen, Jan/A-8346-2008","Moestrup, Soren Kragh/0000-0003-3862-2107; Nolan, Derek/0000-0002-3742-4304; Lins, Laurence/0000-0001-7772-6748; Mottram, Jeremy/0000-0001-5574-3766; Pedersen, Jan/0000-0002-7768-0206; Vanhollebeke, Benoit/0000-0002-0353-365X; Lyngsoe, Jeppe/0000-0002-6301-1300; Homble, Fabrice/0000-0001-6031-136X; Perez-Morga, David/0000-0002-7168-1865; Uzureau, sophie/0000-0002-6444-2815",Belgian Fund for Scientific Research; Walloon WELBIO excellence programme; Interuniversity Attraction Poles Programme-Belgian Science Policy; ERC [233312 TROJA]; European Regional Development Fund; Walloon Region; TGIR-RMN-THC Fr3050 (French high-field NMR network); Welcome Trust,"We thank M.

Gnathostomes use T- and B-cell antigen receptors belonging to the immunoglobulin superfamily(3,4). Cyclostomes, the lampreys and hagfish, instead use leucine-rich repeat proteins to construct variable lymphocyte receptors (VLRs), two types of which, VLRA and VLRB, are reciprocally expressed by lymphocytes resembling gnathostome T and B cells(5-7). Here we define another lineage of T-cell-like lymphocytes that express the recently identified VLRC receptors(8,9). Both VLRC+ and VLRA(+) lymphocytes express orthologues of genes that gnathostome gamma delta and alpha beta T cells use for their differentiation, undergo VLRC and VLRA assembly and repertoire diversification in the 'thymoid' gill region, and express their VLRs solely as cell-surface proteins. Our findings suggest that the genetic programmes for two primordial T-cell lineages and a prototypic B-cell lineage were already present in the last common vertebrate ancestor approximately 500 million years ago.

However, whether a neutralizing antibody could have the breadth of range to target different viral species was unknown. Human respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV) and human metapneumovirus (HMPV) are common pathogens that cause severe disease in premature newborns, hospitalized children(2,3) and immune-compromised patients(2,4,5), and play a role in asthma exacerbations(6). Although antisera generated against either HRSV or HMPV are not cross-neutralizing(7), we speculated that, because of the repeated exposure to these viruses, cross-neutralizing antibodies may be selected in some individuals. Here we describe a human monoclonal antibody (MPE8) that potently cross-neutralizes HRSV and HMPV as well as two animal paramyxoviruses: bovine RSV (BRSV) and pneumonia virus of mice (PVM). In its germline configuration, MPE8 is HRSV-specific and its breadth is achieved by somatic mutations in the light chain variable region. MPE8 did not result in the selection of viral escape mutants that evaded antibody targeting and showed potent prophylactic efficacy in animal models of HRSV and HMPV infection, as well as prophylactic and therapeutic efficacy in the more relevant model of lethal PVM infection. The core epitope of MPE8 was mapped on two highly conserved anti-parallel beta-strands on the pre-fusion viral F protein, which are rearranged in the post-fusion F protein conformation. Twenty-six out of the thirty HRSV-specific neutralizing antibodies isolated were also found to be specific for the pre-fusion F protein. Taken together, these results indicate that MPE8 might be used for the prophylaxis and therapy of severe HRSV and HMPV infections and identify the pre-fusion F protein as a candidate HRSV vaccine.","[Corti, Davide; Bianchi, Siro; Vanzetta, Fabrizia; Agatic, Gloria; Guarino, Barbara] Humabs BioMed SA, CH-6500 Bellinzona, Switzerland; [Corti, Davide; Minola, Andrea; Perez, Laurent; Silacci, Chiara; Marcandalli, Jessica; Sallusto, Federica; Lanzavecchia, Antonio] Univ Svizzera Italiana, Inst Res Biomed, CH-6500 Bellinzona, Switzerland; [Marsland, Benjamin J.] Univ Lausanne, Serv Pneumol, CHUV, CH-1011 Lausanne, Switzerland; [Piralla, Antonio; Percivalle, Elena; Baldanti, Fausto] IRCCS, Policlin San Matteo, I-27100 Pavia, Italy; [Lanzavecchia, Antonio] ETH, Inst Microbiol, CH-8093 Zurich, Switzerland","Lanzavecchia, A (reprint author), Univ Svizzera Italiana, Inst Res Biomed, Via Vincenzo Vela 6, CH-6500 Bellinzona, Switzerland.",davide.corti@humabs.ch; lanzavecchia@irb.usi.ch,,"Bianchi, Siro/0000-0002-5100-8905; Guarino, Barbara/0000-0003-3759-3252; Baldanti, Fausto/0000-0002-3358-8969; Perez, Laurent/0000-0002-8860-7928",European Research Council [250348 IMMUNExplore]; Swiss National Science Foundation [141254]; Helmut Horten Foundation,"We would like to thank M.

The intracellular domains of KCNH channels are structurally distinct from other voltage-gated channels. The amino-terminal region contains an eag domain, which is composed of a Per-Arnt-Sim (PAS) domain and aPAS-cap domain(8), whereas the carboxy-terminal region contains a cyclic nucleotide-binding homology domain (CNBHD), which is connected to the pore through a C-linker domain. Many disease-causing mutations localize to these specialized intracellular domains, which underlie the unique gating and regulation of KCNH channels(9). It has been suggested that the eag domain may regulate the channel by interacting with either the S4-S5 linker or the CNBHD8,10. Here we present a 2 angstrom resolution crystal structure of the eag domain-CNBHD complex of themouse EAG1 (also known as KCNH1) channel. It displays extensive interactions between the eag domain and the CNBHD, indicating that the regulatory mechanism of the eag domain primarily involves the CNBHD. Notably, the structure reveals that a number of LQT2 mutations at homologous positions in human ERG, in addition to cancer-associated mutations in EAG channels, localize to the eag domain-CNBHD interface. Furthermore, mutations at the interface produced marked effects on channel gating, demonstrating the important physiological role of the eag domain-CNBHD interaction. Our structure of the eag domain-CNBHD complex of mouse EAG1 provides unique insights into the physiological and pathophysiological mechanisms of KCNH channels.","[Haitin, Yoni; Carlson, Anne E.; Zagotta, William N.] Univ Washington, Sch Med, Dept Physiol & Biophys, Seattle, WA 98195 USA","Zagotta, WN (reprint author), Univ Washington, Sch Med, Dept Physiol & Biophys, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.",zagotta@uw.edu,,"Haitin, Yoni/0000-0002-1648-6792","National Institutes of Health (NIH) [R01 EY010329]; International Human Frontier Science Program Organization (HFSPO) [LT-001025/2011]; NIH [F32 HL095241]; National Institutes of Health, National Institute of General Medical Sciences; Howard Hughes Medical Institute; Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences of the US Department of Energy [DE-AC02-05CH11231]","We thank S.

Although reinforcement of adaptive social interactions is ostensibly required for the evolutionary persistence of these behaviours, the neural mechanisms by which social reward is encoded by the brain are largely unknown. Here we demonstrate that in mice oxytocin acts as a social reinforcement signal within the nucleus accumbens core, where it elicits a presynaptically expressed long-term depression of excitatory synaptic transmission in medium spiny neurons. Although the nucleus accumbens receives oxytocin-receptor-containing inputs from several brain regions, genetic deletion of these receptors specifically from dorsal raphe nucleus, which provides serotonergic (5-hydroxytryptamine; 5-HT) innervation to the nucleus accumbens, abolishes the reinforcing properties of social interaction. Furthermore, oxytocin-induced synaptic plasticity requires activation of nucleus accumbens 5-HT1B receptors, the blockade of which prevents social reward. These results demonstrate that the rewarding properties of social interaction in mice require the coordinated activity of oxytocin and 5-HT in the nucleus accumbens, a mechanistic insight with implications for understanding the pathogenesis of social dysfunction in neuropsychiatric disorders such as autism.","[Doelen, Guel; Darvishzadeh, Ayeh; Huang, Kee Wui; Malenka, Robert C.] Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Dept Psychiat & Behav Sci, Nancy Pritzker Lab, Stanford, CA 94305 USA","Malenka, RC (reprint author), Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Dept Psychiat & Behav Sci, Nancy Pritzker Lab, 265 Campus Dr, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",malenka@stanford.edu,"Dolen, Gul/J-3073-2015","Dolen, Gul/0000-0003-1780-995X",National Institutes of Health [NIH NS069375]; Simons Foundation Autism Research Initiative; Berry Foundation,"We thank members of the Malenka laboratory for comments; A.

Focusing on skin development and oncogenic (Hras(G12V)-induced) hyperplasia, our screens uncover previously unknown as well as anticipated regulators of embryonic epidermal growth. Among the top oncogenic screen hits are Mllt6 and the Wnt effector beta-catenin, which maintain Hras(G12V)-dependent hyperproliferation. We also expose beta-catenin as an unanticipated antagonist of normal epidermal growth, functioning through Wnt-independent intercellular adhesion. Finally, we validate functional significance in mouse and human cancers, thereby establishing the feasibility of in vivo mammalian genome-wide investigations to dissect tissue development and tumorigenesis.

A key drawback of resonant inelastic X-ray scattering has been the need for high photon densities to compensate for fluorescence yields of less than a per cent for soft X-rays(8). Sample damage from the dominant non-radiative decays thus limits the materials to which such techniques can be applied and the spectral resolution that can be obtained. A means of improving the yield is therefore highly desirable. Here we demonstrate stimulated X-ray emission for crystalline silicon at photon densities that are easily achievable with free-electron lasers(9). The stimulated radiative decay of core excited species at the expense of non-radiative processes reduces sample damage and permits narrow-bandwidth detection in the directed beam of stimulated radiation. We deduce how stimulated X-ray emission can be enhanced by several orders of magnitude to provide, with high yield and reduced sample damage, a superior probe for low-energy excitations and their dispersion in matter. This is the first step to bringing nonlinear X-ray physics in the condensed phase from theory(10-16) to application.","[Beye, M.; Schreck, S.; Sorgenfrei, F.; Trabant, C.; Pontius, N.; Schuessler-Langeheine, C.; Foehlisch, A.] Helmholtz Zentrum Berlin Mat & Energie GmbH, Inst Methods & Instrumentat Synchrotron Radiat Re, D-12489 Berlin, Germany; [Schreck, S.; Trabant, C.; Foehlisch, A.] Univ Potsdam, Fak Phys & Astron, D-14476 Potsdam, Germany; [Sorgenfrei, F.; Wurth, W.] Univ Hamburg, Inst Expt Phys, D-22761 Hamburg, Germany; [Sorgenfrei, F.; Wurth, W.] Ctr Free Electron Laser Sci, D-22761 Hamburg, Germany; [Trabant, C.] Univ Cologne, Inst Phys 2, D-50937 Cologne, Germany","Beye, M (reprint author), Helmholtz Zentrum Berlin Mat & Energie GmbH, Inst Methods & Instrumentat Synchrotron Radiat Re, Albert Einstein Str 15, D-12489 Berlin, Germany.",martin.beye@helmholtz-berlin.de,"SchuSSler-Langeheine, Christian/C-3186-2008; Beye, Martin/F-1165-2011; Pontius, Niko/I-1804-2013","SchuSSler-Langeheine, Christian/0000-0002-4553-9726; Beye, Martin/0000-0002-3924-2993; Alexander, Fohlisch/0000-0003-4126-8233",VolkswagenStiftung; German Federal Ministry of Education and Research; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft [05K10PK2],"We thank N.

The S(N)2 reaction proceeds in a very predictable manner: substitution occurs with inversion of stereochemistry, resulting from the 'backside attack' of the electrophilic carbon by the nucleophile. A significant limitation of the S(N)2 reaction is its intolerance for tertiary carbon atoms: whereas primary and secondary alcohols are viable precursor substrates, tertiary alcohols and their derivatives usually either fail to react or produce stereochemical mixtures of products(1-3). Here we report the stereochemical inversion of chiral tertiary alcohols with a nitrogenous nucleophile facilitated by a Lewis-acid-catalysed solvolysis. The method is chemoselective against secondary and primary alcohols, thereby complementing the selectivity of the S(N)2 reaction. Furthermore, this method for carbon-nitrogen bond formation mimics a putative biosynthetic step in the synthesis of marine terpenoids(4) and enables their preparation from the corresponding terrestrial terpenes. We expect that the general attributes of the methodology will allow chiral tertiary alcohols to be considered viable substrates for stereoinversion reactions.","[Pronin, Sergey V.; Reiher, Christopher A.; Shenvi, Ryan A.] Scripps Res Inst, Dept Chem, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA","Shenvi, RA (reprint author), Scripps Res Inst, Dept Chem, 10550 North Torrey Pines Rd, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA.",rshenvi@scripps.edu,,"Shenvi, Ryan/0000-0001-8353-6449",Eli Lilly; Boehringer Ingelheim; Scripps Research Institute,"We thank C.

Accordingly, variation in the oceanic fixed nitrogen reservoir has been proposed as a cause of glacial-interglacial changes in atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration(2,3). Marine nitrogen fixation, which produces most of the ocean's fixed nitrogen, is thought to be affected by multiple factors, including ocean temperature(4) and the availability of iron(2,3,5) and phosphorus(6). Here we reconstruct changes in North Atlantic nitrogen fixation over the past 160,000 years from the shell-bound nitrogen isotope ratio (N-15/N-14) of planktonic foraminifera in Caribbean Sea sediments. The observed changes cannot be explained by reconstructed changes in temperature, the supply of (iron-bearing) dust or water column denitrification. We identify a strong, roughly 23,000-year cycle in nitrogen fixation and suggest that it is a response to orbitally driven changes in equatorial Atlantic upwelling(7), which imports 'excess' phosphorus (phosphorus in stoichiometric excess of fixed nitrogen) into the tropical North Atlantic surface(5,6). In addition, we find that nitrogen fixation was reduced during glacial stages 6 and 4, when North Atlantic Deep Water had shoaled to become glacial North Atlantic intermediate water(8), which isolated the Atlantic thermocline from excess phosphorus-rich mid-depth waters that today enter from the Southern Ocean. Although modern studies have yielded diverse views of the controls on nitrogen fixation(1,2,4,5), our palaeobiogeochemical data suggest that excess phosphorus is the master variable in the North Atlantic Ocean and indicate that the variations in its supply over the most recent glacial cycle were dominated by the response of regional ocean circulation to the orbital cycles.","[Straub, Marietta; Martinez-Garcia, Alfredo; Meckler, A.

Holocene aquifers are the source of widespread arsenic poisoning across the region(2,3). In contrast, Pleistocene sands deposited in this region more than 12,000 years ago mostly do not host groundwater with high levels of arsenic. Pleistocene aquifers are increasingly used as a safe source of drinking water(4) and it is therefore important to understand under what conditions low levels of arsenic can be maintained. Here we reconstruct the initial phase of contamination of a Pleistocene aquifer near Hanoi, Vietnam. We demonstrate that changes in groundwater flow conditions and the redox state of the aquifer sands induced by groundwater pumping caused the lateral intrusion of arsenic contamination more than 120 metres from a Holocene aquifer into a previously uncontaminated Pleistocene aquifer. We also find that arsenic adsorbs onto the aquifer sands and that there is a 16-20-fold retardation in the extent of the contamination relative to the reconstructed lateral movement of groundwater over the same period. Our findings suggest that arsenic contamination of Pleistocene aquifers in south and southeast Asia as a consequence of increasing levels of groundwater pumping may have been delayed by the retardation of arsenic transport.","[van Geen, Alexander; Bostick, Benjamin C.; Radloff, Kathleen; Aziz, Zahid; Mey, Jacob L.] Columbia Univ, Lamont Doherty Earth Observ, Palisades, NY 10964 USA; [Pham Thi Kim Trang; Vi Mai Lan; Nguyen-Ngoc Mai; Phu Dao Manh; Pham Hung Viet] Vietnam Natl Univ, Hanoi Univ Sci, Res Ctr Environm Technol & Sustainable Dev CETASD, Hanoi, Vietnam; [Mey, Jacob L.] Kingsborough Community Coll, Dept Phys Sci, Brooklyn, NY 11235 USA; [Stahl, Mason O.; Harvey, Charles F.] MIT, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Oates, Peter] Anchor QEA, Montvale, NJ 07645 USA; [Weinman, Beth] Vanderbilt Univ, Nashville, TN 37235 USA; [Stengel, Caroline; Frei, Felix; Kipfer, Rolf; Berg, Michael] Eawag, Swiss Fed Inst Aquat Sci & Technol, CH-8600 Dubendorf, Switzerland; [Kipfer, Rolf] Zurich ETHZ, Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Inst Geochem & Petrol, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland","van Geen, A (reprint author), Columbia Univ, Lamont Doherty Earth Observ, Palisades, NY 10964 USA.",avangeen@ldeo.columbia.edu,"harvey, charles/A-8601-2012; Mey, Jacob/D-5957-2014; Berg, Michael/C-3738-2012","harvey, charles/0000-0002-7759-4447; Mey, Jacob/0000-0003-0116-4149; Berg, Michael/0000-0002-7342-4061","NSF [EAR 09-11557]; Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation [NAFOSTED 105-09-59-09]; NIEHS [P42 ES010349, P42 ES016454]","This study was supported by NSF grant EAR 09-11557, the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation, grant NAFOSTED 105-09-59-09 to CETASD, and NIEHS grants P42 ES010349 and P42 ES016454.

Terrestrial core segregation imprinted the residual mantle composition by scavenging siderophile (iron-loving) elements such as tungsten, cobalt and sulphur. Cosmochemical constraints suggest that about 97% of Earth's sulphur should at present reside in the core(1), which implies that the residual silicate mantle should exhibit fractionated S-34/S-32 ratios according to the relevant metal-silicate partition coefficients(2), together with fractionated siderophile element abundances. However, Earth's mantle has long been thought to be both homogeneous and chondritic for S-34/S-32, similar to Canyon Diablo troilite(3-6), as it is for most siderophile elements. This belief was consistent with a mantle sulphur budget dominated by late-accreted chondritic components. Here we show that the mantle, as sampled bymid-ocean ridge basalts from the south Atlantic ridge, displays heterogeneous S-34/S-32 ratios, directly correlated to the strontium and neodymium isotope ratios Sr-87/Sr-86 and Nd-143/Nd-144. These isotope trends are compatible with binary mixing between a low-S-34/S-32 ambient mantle and a high-S-34/S-32 recycled component that we infer to be subducted sediments. The depleted end-member is characterized by a significantly negative delta S-34 of -1.28 +/- 0.33 parts per thousand that cannot reach a chondritic value even when surface sulphur (from continents, altered oceanic crust, sediments and oceans) is added. Such a non-chondritic S-34/S-32 ratio for the silicate Earth could be accounted for by a core-mantle differentiation record in which the core has a S-34/S-32 ratio slightly higher than that of chondrites (delta S-34=+0.07 parts per thousand). Despite evidence for late-veneer addition of siderophile elements (and therefore sulphur) after core formation, our results imply that the mantle sulphur budget retains fingerprints of core-mantle differentiation.","[Labidi, J.; Cartigny, P.] Univ Paris Diderot, Inst Phys Globe Paris, Lab Geochim Isotopes Stables, Sorbonne Paris Cite,UMR 7154,CNRS, F-75005 Paris, France; [Moreira, M.] Univ Paris Diderot, Inst Phys Globe Paris, Lab Geochim & Cosmochim, Sorbonne Paris Cite,UMR 7154,CNRS, F-75005 Paris, France","Labidi, J (reprint author), Univ Paris Diderot, Inst Phys Globe Paris, Lab Geochim Isotopes Stables, Sorbonne Paris Cite,UMR 7154,CNRS, 1 Rue Jussieu, F-75005 Paris, France.",labidi@ipgp.fr,"Cartigny, Pierre/A-6251-2011; moreira, manuel/H-5329-2017","moreira, manuel/0000-0001-5845-4660",Region Ile de France (Sesame); CNRS (INSU-Mi-lourd); CNRS (SEDIT-CNRS); IPGP (BQR),"Support from the Region Ile de France (Sesame), CNRS (INSU-Mi-lourd and SEDIT-CNRS) and IPGP (BQR) is acknowledged.

Attempts to rationally design ligand-binding proteins have met with little success, however, and the computational design of protein-small-molecule interfaces remains an unsolved problem(1). Current approaches for designing ligand-binding proteins for medical(2) and biotechnological uses rely on raising antibodies against a target antigen in immunized animals(3,4) and/or performing laboratory-directed evolution of proteins with an existing low affinity for the desired ligand(5-7), neither of which allows complete control over the interactions involved in binding. Here we describe a general computational method for designing pre-organized and shape complementary small-molecule-binding sites, and use it to generate protein binders to the steroid digoxigenin (DIG). Of seventeen experimentally characterized designs, two bind DIG; the model of the higher affinity binder has the most energetically favourable and pre-organized interface in the design set. A comprehensive binding-fitness landscape of this design, generated by library selections and deep sequencing, was used to optimize its binding affinity to a picomolar level, and X-ray co-crystal structures of two variants show atomic-level agreement with the corresponding computational models. The optimized binder is selective for DIG over the related steroids digitoxigenin, progesterone and beta-oestradiol, and this steroid binding preference can be reprogrammed by manipulation of explicitly designed hydrogen-bonding interactions. The computational design method presented here should enable the development of a new generation of biosensors, therapeutics and diagnostics.","[Tinberg, Christine E.; Khare, Sagar D.; Baker, David] Univ Washington, Dept Biochem, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Dou, Jiayi] Univ Washington, Dept Bioengn, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Dou, Jiayi] Univ Washington, Grad Program Biol Phys Struct & Design, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Doyle, Lindsey; Stoddard, Barry L.] Fred Hutchinson Canc Res Ctr, Div Basic Sci, Seattle, WA 98109 USA; [Nelson, Jorgen W.] Univ Washington, Dept Genome Sci, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Schena, Alberto; Johnsson, Kai] Ecole Polytech Fed Lausanne, Inst Chem Sci & Engn, Inst Bioengn, Natl Ctr Competence Res NCCR Chem Biol, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland; [Jankowski, Wojciech; Kalodimos, Charalampos G.] Rutgers State Univ, Ctr Integrat Prote Res, Dept Chem & Chem Biol, Piscataway, NJ 08854 USA; [Baker, David] Univ Washington, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Seattle, WA 98195 USA","Baker, D (reprint author), Univ Washington, Dept Biochem, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.",dabaker@u.washington.edu,"johnsson, kai/P-4222-2014; Baker, David/K-8941-2012","johnsson, kai/0000-0002-8002-1981; Baker, David/0000-0001-7896-6217",Washington State Life Sciences Discovery Fund; Center for the Intracellular Delivery of Biologics; National Human Genome Research Institute under the Interdisciplinary Training in Genome Sciences program [T32 HG00035]; DTRA; DARPA; Swiss National Science Foundation; National Science Foundation [MCB1121896],"We thank E.-M.

Here we report a screen for de novo mutations in patients with two classical epileptic encephalopathies: infantile spasms (n = 149) and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (n = 115). We sequenced the exomes of 264 probands, and their parents, and confirmed 329 de novo mutations. A likelihood analysis showed a significant excess of de novo mutations in the similar to 4,000 genes that are the most intolerant to functional genetic variation in the human population (P = 2.9 x 10(-3)). Among these are GABRB3, with de novo mutations in four patients, and ALG13, with the same de novo mutation in two patients; both genes show clear statistical evidence of association with epileptic encephalopathy. Given the relevant site-specific mutation rates, the probabilities of these outcomes occurring by chance are P = 4.1 x 10(-10) and P = 7.8 x 10(-12), respectively. Other genes with de novo mutations in this cohort include CACNA1A, CHD2, FLNA, GABRA1, GRIN1, GRIN2B, HNRNPU, IQSEC2, MTOR and NEDD4L. Finally, we show that the de novo mutations observed are enriched in specific gene sets including genes regulated by the fragile X protein (P < 10(-8)), as has been reported previously for autism spectrum disorders(2).","[Allen, Andrew S.] Duke Univ, Med Ctr, Dept Biostat & Bioinformat, Duke Clin Res Inst, Durham, NC 27710 USA; [Allen, Andrew S.] Duke Univ, Med Ctr, Ctr Human Genome Variat, Durham, NC 27710 USA; [Berkovic, Samuel F.; Petrovski, Slave] Univ Melbourne Austin Hlth, Dept Med, Epilepsy Res Ctr, Heidelberg, Vic 3084, Australia; [Cossette, Patrick] Univ Montreal, CHUM Hop Notre Dame Montre, Montreal, PQ H2L 4M1, Canada; [Cossette, Patrick] CHUM Res Ctr, Montreal, PQ H2L 4M1, Canada; [Delanty, Norman] Royal Coll Surg, Dublin 9, Ireland; [Delanty, Norman] Beaumont Hosp, Dept Neurol, Dublin 9, Ireland; [Dlugos, Dennis; Venkat, Anu] Univ Penn, Perelman Sch Med, Childrens Hosp Philadelphia, Dept Neurol & Pediat, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Eichler, Evan E.] Univ Washington, Sch Med, Dept Gen Sci, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Eichler, Evan E.] Univ Washington, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Epstein, Michael P.] Emory Univ, Sch Med, Dept Human Genet, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA; [Glauser, Tracy] Cincinnati Childrens Hosp Med Ctr, Div Neurol, Cincinnati, OH 45229 USA; [Goldstein, David B.; Han, Yujun; Heinzen, Erin L.; Hitomi, Yuki; Lu, Yi-Fan; Petrovski, Slave; Ruzzo, Elizabeth K.] Duke Univ, Sch Med, Ctr Human Genome Variat, Durham, NC 27708 USA; [Howell, Katherine B.] Royal Childrens Hosp Melbourne, Dept Neurol, Parkville, Vic 3052, Australia; [Johnson, Michael R.] Ctr Clin Translat Div Brain Sci, London SW7 2AZ, England; [Kuzniecky, Ruben; French, Jacqueline; Friedman, Daniel] NYU, Sch Med, Dept Neurol, Comprehens Epilepsy Ctr, New York, NY 10016 USA; [Lowenstein, Daniel H.; Madou, Maura R.

We have previously demonstrated that, by using cytokines, embryonic stem cells and induced pluripotent stem cells can be induced into epiblast-like cells (EpiLCs) and then into primordial germcell (PGC)-like cells with the capacity for both spermatogenesis and oogenesis(1,2), creating an opportunity for understanding and regulating mammalian germ-cell development in both sexes in vitro. Here we show that, without cytokines, simultaneous overexpression of three transcription factors, Blimp1 (also known as Prdm1), Prdm14 and Tfap2c (also known as AP2c), directs EpiLCs, but not embryonic stem cells, swiftly and efficiently into a PGC state. Notably, Prdm14 alone, but not Blimp1 or Tfap2c, suffices for the induction of the PGC state in EpiLCs. The transcription-factor-induced PGC state, irrespective of the transcription factors used, reconstitutes key transcriptome and epigenetic reprogramming in PGCs, but bypasses a mesodermal program that accompanies PGC or PGC-like-cell specification by cytokines including bone morphogenetic protein 4. Notably, the transcription-factor-induced PGC-like cells contribute to spermatogenesis and fertile offspring. Our findings provide a new insight into the transcriptional logic for PGC specification, and create a foundation for the transcription-factor-based reconstitution and regulation of mammalian gametogenesis.","[Nakaki, Fumio; Hayashi, Katsuhiko; Ohta, Hiroshi; Kurimoto, Kazuki; Yabuta, Yukihiro; Saitou, Mitinori] Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Med, Dept Anat & Cell Biol, Sakyo Ku, Kyoto 6068501, Japan; [Hayashi, Katsuhiko; Saitou, Mitinori] Kyoto Univ, Ctr iPS Cell Res & Applicat, Sakyo Ku, Kyoto 6068507, Japan; [Hayashi, Katsuhiko] JST, PRESTO, Sakyo Ku, Kyoto 6068501, Japan; [Ohta, Hiroshi; Kurimoto, Kazuki; Yabuta, Yukihiro; Saitou, Mitinori] JST, ERATO, Sakyo Ku, Kyoto 6068501, Japan; [Saitou, Mitinori] Kyoto Univ, Inst Integrated Cell Mat Sci, Sakyo Ku, Kyoto 6068501, Japan","Saitou, M (reprint author), Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Med, Dept Anat & Cell Biol, Sakyo Ku, Yoshida Konoe Cho, Kyoto 6068501, Japan.",saitou@anat2.med.kyoto-u.ac.jp,"Nakaki, Fumio/B-8284-2015","Nakaki, Fumio/0000-0003-4332-7735","Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology of Japan; JST-CREST/ERATO; Takeda Science Foundation; Academia for Repro-regenerative Medicine","We thank A.

Pluripotent stem cells such as embryonic stem cells were recently shown to organize their chromosomes into topological domains that are largely invariant between cell types(1,2). Here we combine chromatin conformation capture technologies with chromatin factor binding data to demonstrate that inactive chromatin is unusually disorganized in pluripotent stem-cell nuclei. We show that gene promoters engage in contacts between topological domains in a largely tissue-independent manner, whereas enhancers have a more tissue-restricted interaction profile. Notably, genomic clusters of pluripotency factor binding sites find each other very efficiently, in a manner that is strictly pluripotent-stem-cell-specific, dependent on the presence of Oct4 and Nanog protein and inducible after artificial recruitment of Nanog to a selected chromosomal site. We conclude that pluripotent stem cells have a unique higher-order genome structure shaped by pluripotency factors. We speculate that this interactome enhances the robustness of the pluripotent state.","[de Wit, Elzo; Bouwman, Britta A. M.; Zhu, Yun; Klous, Petra; Splinter, Erik; Verstegen, Marjon J. A.

As these tumours represent an area of high unmet medical need, multiple allosteric MEK inhibitors, which inhibit MAPK signalling in both genotypes, are being tested in clinical trials. Impressive single-agent activity in BRAF-mutant melanoma has been observed; however, efficacy has been far less robust in KRAS-mutant disease(1). Here we show that, owing to distinct mechanisms regulating MEK activation in KRAS-versus BRAF-driven tumours(2,3), different mechanisms of inhibition are required for optimal antitumour activity in each genotype. Structural and functional analysis illustrates that MEK inhibitors with superior efficacy in KRAS-driven tumours (GDC-0623 and G-573, the former currently in phase I clinical trials) form a strong hydrogen-bond interaction with S212 in MEK that is critical for blocking MEK feedback phosphorylation by wild-type RAF. Conversely, potent inhibition of active, phosphorylated MEK is required for strong inhibition of the MAPK pathway in BRAF-mutant tumours, resulting in superior efficacy in this genotype with GDC-0973 (also known as cobimetinib), a MEK inhibitor currently in phase III clinical trials. Our study highlights that differences in the activation state of MEK in KRAS-mutant tumours versus BRAF-mutant tumours can be exploited through the design of inhibitors that uniquely target these distinct activation states of MEK. These inhibitors are currently being evaluated in clinical trials to determine whether improvements in therapeutic index within KRAS versus BRAF preclinical models translate to improved clinical responses in patients.","[Hatzivassiliou, Georgia; Song, Kyung; Orr, Christine; Merchant, Mark; Hoeflich, Klaus P.; Chan, Jocelyn; Luoh, Shiuh-Ming; Friedman, Lori S.; Belvin, Marcia] Genentech Inc, Dept Translat Oncol, San Francisco, CA 94080 USA; [Haling, Jacob R.; Peck, Ariana; Malek, Shiva] Genentech Inc, Dept Biochem & Cellular Pharmacol, San Francisco, CA 94080 USA; [Chen, Huifen; Zak, Mark] Genentech Inc, Dept Discovery Chem, San Francisco, CA 94080 USA; [Price, Steve; Heald, Robert; Hewitt, Joanne F.

Antiviral treatments are only partially effective against HCV infection, and a vaccine is not available. Development of more efficient therapies has been hampered by the lack of a small animal model. Building on the observation that CD81 and occludin (OCLN) comprise the minimal set of human factors required to render mouse cells permissive to HCV entry(1), we previously showed that transient expression of these two human genes is sufficient to allow viral uptake into fully immunocompetent inbred mice(2). Here we demonstrate that transgenic mice stably expressing human CD81 and OCLN also support HCV entry, but innate and adaptive immune responses restrict HCV infection in vivo. Blunting antiviral immunity in genetically humanized mice infected with HCV results in measurable viraemia over several weeks. In mice lacking the essential cellular cofactor cyclophilin A (CypA), HCV RNA replication is markedly diminished, providing genetic evidence that this process is faithfully recapitulated. Using a cell-based fluorescent reporter activated by the NS3-4A protease we visualize HCV infection in single hepatocytes in vivo. Persistently infected mice produce de novo infectious particles, which can be inhibited with directly acting antiviral drug treatment, thereby providing evidence for the completion of the entire HCV life cycle in inbred mice. This genetically humanized mouse model opens new opportunities to dissect genetically HCV infection in vivo and provides an important preclinical platform for testing and prioritizing drug candidates and may also have utility for evaluating vaccine efficacy.","[Dorner, Marcus; Horwitz, Joshua A.; Donovan, Bridget M.; Labitt, Rachael N.; Budell, William C.; Friling, Tamar; Vogt, Alexander; Catanese, Maria Teresa; Rice, Charles M.; Ploss, Alexander] Rockefeller Univ, Ctr Study Hepatitis C, New York, NY 10065 USA; [Satoh, Takashi; Kawai, Taro; Akira, Shizuo] Osaka Univ, WPI Immunol Frontier Res Ctr, Lab Host Def, Suita, Osaka 5650871, Japan; [Law, Mansun] Scripps Res Inst, Dept Immunol & Microbial Sci, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA","Ploss, A (reprint author), Princeton Univ, Dept Mol Biol, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA.",ricec@rockefeller.edu; aploss@princeton.edu,"Akira, Shizuo/C-3134-2009","Vogt, Alexander/0000-0002-9917-112X; Dorner, Marcus/0000-0003-0321-4226","National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases [RC1DK087193]; National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Disease [R01AI072613, R01AI099284]; National Cancer Institute [R01CA057973]; The Starr Foundation; Greenberg Medical Research Institute; Richard Salomon Family Foundation; Ronald A.

These cytokines are recognized by members of the TNF receptor (TNFR) family of death receptors, including TNFR1 and TNFR2, and FAS and TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) receptors(1). Death receptor signalling requires death-domain-mediated homotypic/heterotypic interactions between the receptor and its downstream adaptors, including TNFR1-associated death domain protein (TRADD) and FAS-associated death domain protein (FADD)(2). Here we discover that death domains in several proteins, including TRADD, FADD, RIPK1 and TNFR1, were directly inactivated by NleB, an entero-pathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) type III secretion system effector known to inhibit host nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappa B) signalling(3,4). NleB contained an unprecedented N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) transferase activity that specifically modified a conserved arginine in these death domains (Arg 235 in the TRADD death domain). NleB GlcNAcylation (the addition of GlcNAc onto a protein side chain) of death domains blocked homotypic/heterotypic death domain interactions and assembly of the oligomeric TNFR1 complex, thereby disrupting TNF signalling in EPEC-infected cells, including NF-kappa B signalling, apoptosis and necroptosis. Type-III-delivered NleB also blocked FAS ligand and TRAIL-induced cell death by preventing formation of a FADD-mediated death-inducing signalling complex (DISC). The arginine GlcNAc transferase activity of NleB was required for bacterial colonization in the mouse model of EPEC infection. The mechanism of action of NleB represents a new model by which bacteria counteract host defences, and also a previously unappreciated post-translational modification.","[Li, Shan; Yao, Qing] China Agr Univ, Coll Biol Sci, Beijing 100094, Peoples R China; [Li, Shan; Zhang, Li; Yao, Qing; Li, Lin; Dong, Na; Gao, Wenqing; Ding, Xiaojun; Sun, Liming; Chen, She; Shao, Feng] Natl Inst Biol Sci, Beijing 102206, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Li] Chinese Acad Med Sci, Grad Sch, Beijing 100730, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Li] Beijing Union Med Coll, Beijing 100730, Peoples R China; [Rong, Jie; Chen, Xing] Peking Univ, Coll Chem & Mol Engn, Dept Biol Chem, Beijing Natl Lab Mol Sci, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China","Chen, S (reprint author), Natl Inst Biol Sci, Beijing 102206, Peoples R China.",chenshe@nibs.ac.cn; shaofeng@nibs.ac.cn,"Chen, Xing/C-1914-2015","Chen, Xing/0000-0002-3058-7370","Howard Hughes Medical Institute; National Basic Research Program of China 973 Programs [2010CB835400, 2012CB518700, 2010CB835204]","We thank I.

Pathogens such as Salmonella, Shigella and enteropathogenic and enterohaemorrhagic (EPEC and EHEC, respectively) Escherichia coli use a type III secretion system(T3SS) to deliver virulence effector proteins into host cells during infection that promote colonization and interfere with antimicrobial host responses(1-3). Here we report that the T3SS effector NleB1 from EPEC binds to host cell death-domain-containing proteins and thereby inhibits death receptor signalling. Protein interaction studies identified FADD, TRADD and RIPK1 as binding partners of NleB1. NleB1 expressed ectopically or injected by the bacterial T3SS prevented Fas ligand or TNF-induced formation of the canonical death-inducing signalling complex (DISC) and proteolytic activation of caspase-8, an essential step in death-receptor-induced apoptosis. This inhibition depended on the N-acetylglucosamine transferase activity of NleB1, which specifically modified Arg 117 in the death domain of FADD. The importance of the death receptor apoptotic pathway to host defence was demonstrated using mice deficient in the FAS signalling pathway, which showed delayed clearance of the EPEC-like mouse pathogen Citrobacter rodentium and reversion to virulence of an nleB mutant. The activity of NleB suggests that EPEC and other attaching and effacing pathogens antagonize death-receptor-induced apoptosis of infected cells, thereby blocking a major antimicrobial host response.","[Pearson, Jaclyn S.; Giogha, Cristina; Ong, Sze Ying; Kennedy, Catherine L.; Kelly, Michelle; Lung, Tania Wong Fok; Riedmaier, Patrice; Oates, Clare V.

However, they also represent a major barrier to effective anti-tumour immunity and sterilizing immunity to chronic viral infections(1). The transcription factor Foxp3 has a major role in the development and programming of T-reg cells(2,3). The relative stability of T-reg cells at inflammatory disease sites has been a highly contentious subject(4-6). There is considerable interest in identifying pathways that control the stability of T-reg cells as many immune-mediated diseases are characterized by either exacerbated or limited T-reg-cell function. Here we show that the immune-cell-expressed ligand semaphorin-4a (Sema4a) and the T-reg-cell-expressed receptor neuropilin-1 (Nrp1) interact both in vitro, to potentiate T-reg-cell function and survival, and in vivo, at inflammatory sites. Using mice with a T-reg-cell-restricted deletion of Nrp1, we show that Nrp1 is dispensable for suppression of autoimmunity and maintenance of immune homeostasis, but is required by T-reg cells to limit anti-tumour immune responses and to cure established inflammatory colitis. Sema4a ligation of Nrp1 restrained Akt phosphorylation cellularly and at the immunologic synapse by phosphatase and tensin homologue (PTEN), which increased nuclear localization of the transcription factor Foxo3a. The Nrp1-induced transcriptome promoted T-reg-cell stability by enhancing quiescence and survival factors while inhibiting programs that promote differentiation. Importantly, this Nrp1-dependent molecular program is evident in intra-tumoral T-reg cells. Our data support a model in which T-reg-cell stability can be subverted in certain inflammatory sites, but is maintained by a Sema4a-Nrp1 axis, highlighting this pathway as a potential therapeutic target that could limit T-reg-cell-mediated tumour-induced tolerance without inducing autoimmunity.","[Delgoffe, Greg M.; Woo, Seng-Ryong; Turnis, Meghan E.; Gravano, David M.; Guy, Cliff; Overacre, Abigail E.; Bettini, Matthew L.; Workman, Creg J.; Vignali, Dario A.

Phosphatidylserine (PS), for example, is synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum and then preferentially associates-through mechanisms not fully elucidated-with the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane(1-3). Lipids can travel via transport vesicles. Alternatively, several protein families knownas lipid-transfer proteins (LTPs) can extract a variety of specific lipids from biological membranes and transport them, within a hydrophobic pocket, through aqueous phases(4-7). Here we report the development of an integrated approach that combines protein fractionation and lipidomics to characterize the LTP-lipid complexes formed in vivo. We applied the procedure to 13 LTPs in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae: the six Sec14 homology (Sfh) proteins and the seven oxysterol-binding homology (Osh) proteins. We found that Osh6 and Osh7 have an unexpected specificity for PS. In vivo, they participate in PS homeostasis and the transport of this lipid to the plasma membrane. The structure of Osh6 bound to PS reveals unique features that are conserved among other metazoan oxysterol-binding proteins (OSBPs) and are required for PS recognition. Our findings represent the first direct evidence, to our knowledge, for the non-vesicular transfer of PS from its site of biosynthesis (the endoplasmic reticulum) to its site of biological activity (the plasma membrane). We describe a new subfamily of OSBPs, including human ORP5 and ORP10, that transfer PS and propose new mechanisms of action for a protein family that is involved in several human pathologies such as cancer, dyslipidaemia and metabolic syndrome.","[Maeda, Kenji; Anand, Kanchan; Chiapparino, Antonella; Kumar, Arun; Poletto, Mattia; Kaksonen, Marko; Gavin, Anne-Claude] European Mol Biol Lab, D-69117 Heidelberg, Germany","Gavin, AC (reprint author), European Mol Biol Lab, Meyerhofstr 1, D-69117 Heidelberg, Germany.",gavin@embl.de,,"Maeda, Kenji/0000-0002-9080-5691; Chiapparino, Antonella/0000-0001-6336-2736; Gavin, Anne-Claude/0000-0003-4917-2340; Kaksonen, Marko/0000-0003-3645-7689",Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) [01GS0865]; European Molecular Biology Laboratory; EU Marie Curie Actions Interdisciplinary Postdoctoral Cofunded Programme; Marie Curie reintegration grant (ERG); Danish Natural Science Research Council [09-064986/FNU],"We are grateful to C.

We previously identified a non-vesicular intra-Golgi transport pathway for glucosylceramide (GlcCer)-the common precursor of the different series of glycosphingolipids-that is operated by the cytosolic GlcCer-transfer protein FAPP2 (also known as PLEKHA8) (ref. 1). However, the molecular determinants of the FAPP2-mediated transfer of GlcCer from the cis-Golgi to the trans-Golgi network, as well as the physiological relevance of maintaining two parallel transport pathways of GlcCer-vesicular and non-vesicular-through the Golgi, remain poorly defined. Here, using mouse and cell models, we clarify the molecular mechanisms underlying the intra-Golgi vectorial transfer of GlcCer by FAPP2 and show that GlcCer is channelled by vesicular and non-vesicular transport to two topologically distinct glycosylation tracks in the Golgi cisternae and the trans-Golgi network, respectively. Our results indicate that the transport modality across the Golgi complex is a key determinant for the glycosylation pattern of a cargo and establish a new paradigm for the branching of the glycosphingolipid synthetic pathway.","[D'Angelo, Giovanni; Polishchuk, Elena; Santoro, Michele; Capuani, Fabrizio; De Matteis, Maria Antonietta] Telethon Inst Genet & Med, I-80131 Naples, Italy; [D'Angelo, Giovanni; Varriale, Antonio; D'Auria, Sabato] CNR, Inst Prot Biochem, I-80131 Naples, Italy; [Uemura, Takefumi; Sato, Takashi; Harada, Akihiro] Gunma Univ, Inst Mol & Cellular Regulat, Dept Mol & Cellular Biol, Lab Mol Traff, Gunma 3718512, Japan; [Chuang, Chia-Chen; Platt, Frances M.] Univ Oxford, Dept Pharmacol, Oxford OX1 3QT, England; [Ohvo-Rekila, Henna; Mattjus, Peter] Abo Akad Univ, Dept Biosci, FI-20520 Turku, Finland; [Di Tullio, Giuseppe; Daniele, Tiziana] Ist Ric Farmacol Mario Negri, Consorzio Mario Negri Sud, Dept Cell Biol & Oncol, I-66030 Chieti, Italy; [Johannes, Ludger] Inst Curie, Ctr Rech, F-75248 Paris 05, France; [Johannes, Ludger] CNRS, UMR144, F-75248 Paris, France; [Monti, Maria; Pucci, Piero] Univ Naples Federico II, Dipartimento Sci Chim, I-80145 Naples, Italy; [Monti, Maria; Pucci, Piero] Univ Naples Federico II, CEINGE Biotecnol Avanzate, I-80145 Naples, Italy; [Williams, Roger L.; Burke, John E.] MRC Lab Mol Biol, Cambridge CB2 0QH, England; [Harada, Akihiro] Osaka Univ, Dept Cell Biol, Suita, Osaka 5650871, Japan","De Matteis, MA (reprint author), Telethon Inst Genet & Med, Via Pietro Castellino 111, I-80131 Naples, Italy.",dematteis@tigem.it,"; Capuani, Fabrizio/B-7829-2008; d'auria, sabato/C-3565-2015; Johannes, Ludger/M-9778-2017","Burke, John/0000-0001-7904-9859; D'Angelo, Giovanni/0000-0002-0734-4127; Capuani, Fabrizio/0000-0003-2026-6335; d'auria, sabato/0000-0001-9320-494X; Johannes, Ludger/0000-0002-2168-0004; DANGELO, GIOVANNI/0000-0001-5466-8709; Mattjus, Peter/0000-0001-8991-5933; PUCCI, Pietro/0000-0002-5885-1495; MONTI, Maria/0000-0002-7775-7154","Telethon [GSP08002, GGP06166]; Associazione Italiana per la Ricerca sul Cancro (AIRC) [IG 8623]; EU (FP7 Lipidomicnet); AIRC [MFAG 10585]; Academy of Finland; Sigrid Juselius Foundation; Study Abroad Scholarship from the Taiwan Ministry of Education","We thank A.

Removal of the stimulus closes the gate and allows the selectivity filter to interconvert back to its conductive conformation (recovery). Given that the structural differences between the conductive and inactivated filter are very small, it is unclear why the recovery process can take up to several seconds. The bacterial K+ channel KcsA from Streptomyces lividans can be used to help elucidate questions about channel inactivation and recovery at the atomic level. Although KcsA contains only a pore domain, without voltage-sensing machinery, it has the structural elements necessary for ion conduction, activation and inactivation(1-7). Here we reveal, by means of a series of long molecular dynamics simulations, how the selectivity filter is sterically locked in the inactive conformation by buried water molecules bound behind the selectivity filter. Potential of mean force calculations show how the recovery process is affected by the buried water molecules and the rebinding of an external K+ ion. A kinetic model deduced from the simulations shows how releasing the buried water molecules can stretch the timescale of recovery to seconds. This leads to the prediction that reducing the occupancy of the buried water molecules by imposing a high osmotic stress should accelerate the rate of recovery, which was verified experimentally by measuring the recovery rate in the presence of a 2-molar sucrose concentration.","[Ostmeyer, Jared; Pan, Albert C.; Perozo, Eduardo; Roux, Benoit] Univ Chicago, Dept Biochem & Mol Biol, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Chakrapani, Sudha] Case Western Reserve Univ, Sch Med, Dept Physiol & Biophys, Cleveland, OH 44106 USA","Roux, B (reprint author), Univ Chicago, Dept Biochem & Mol Biol, 929 E57th St, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.",roux@uchicago.edu,,"chakrapani, sudha/0000-0003-0722-2338; Pan, Albert/0000-0001-5050-5603","National Institute of Health [R01-GM062342, R01-GM57846]; Office of Science of the Department of Energy [DE-AC05-00OR22725]; Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center (PSC) through National Institutes of Health [RC2GM093307]","This work was supported by the National Institute of Health through grant R01-GM062342 (J.O. and B.

IgH V(D)J assembly occurs in progenitor (pro-) B cells followed by that of IgL in precursor (pre-) B cells. Expression of IgH mu and IgL (Ig kappa or Ig lambda) chains generates IgM, which is expressed on immature B cells as the B-cell antigen-binding receptor (BCR). Rag expression can continue in immature B cells(2), allowing continued Ig kappa V(D)J recombination that replaces the initial V kappa J kappa exon with one that generates a new specificity(3-5). This 'receptor editing' process, which can also lead to Ig lambda V(D)J recombination and expression(3,6,7), provides a mechanism whereby antigen encounter at the Rag-expressing immature B-cell stage helps shape pre-immune BCR repertoires. As the major site of postnatal B-cell development, the bone marrow is the principal location of primary immunoglobulin repertoire diversification in mice. Here we report that early B-cell development also occurs within the mouse intestinal lamina propria (LP), where the associated V(D)J recombination/receptor editing processes modulate primary LP immunoglobulin repertoires. At weanling age in normally housed mice, the LP contains a population of Rag-expressing B-lineage cells that harbour intermediates indicative of ongoing V(D)J recombination and which contain cells with pro-B, pre-B and editing phenotypes. Consistent with LP-specific receptor editing, Rag-expressing LP B-lineage cells have similar V-H repertoires, but significantly different V kappa repertoires, compared to those of Rag2-expressing bone marrow counterparts. Moreover, colonization of germ-free mice leads to an increased ratio of Ig lambda-expressing versus Ig kappa-expressing B cells specifically in the LP. We conclude that B-cell development occurs in the intestinal mucosa, where it is regulated by extracellular signals from commensal microbes that influence gut immunoglobulin repertoires.","[Wesemann, Duane R.; Portuguese, Andrew J.; Meyers, Robin M.; Gallagher, Michael P.; Cluff-Jones, Kendra; Magee, Jennifer M.; Panchakshari, Rohit A.; Alt, Frederick W.] Childrens Hosp Boston, Program Cellular & Mol Med, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Wesemann, Duane R.; Portuguese, Andrew J.; Meyers, Robin M.; Gallagher, Michael P.; Cluff-Jones, Kendra; Magee, Jennifer M.; Panchakshari, Rohit A.; Alt, Frederick W.] Childrens Hosp Boston, Dept Med, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Wesemann, Duane R.; Portuguese, Andrew J.; Meyers, Robin M.; Gallagher, Michael P.; Cluff-Jones, Kendra; Magee, Jennifer M.; Panchakshari, Rohit A.; Alt, Frederick W.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Genet, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Wesemann, Duane R.; Portuguese, Andrew J.; Meyers, Robin M.; Gallagher, Michael P.; Cluff-Jones, Kendra; Magee, Jennifer M.; Panchakshari, Rohit A.; Alt, Frederick W.] Howard Hughes Med Inst, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Wesemann, Duane R.] Brigham & Womens Hosp, Dept Med, Div Rheumatol Immunol & Allergy, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Rodig, Scott J.] Brigham & Womens Hosp, Dept Pathol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Kepler, Thomas B.] Boston Univ, Sch Med, Dept Microbiol, Boston, MA 02215 USA","Alt, FW (reprint author), Childrens Hosp Boston, Program Cellular & Mol Med, Boston, MA 02115 USA.",dwesemann@research.bwh.harvard.edu; alt@enders.tch.harvard.edu,,"Meyers, Robin/0000-0002-1802-7231","National Institutes of Health [AI020047, AI89972, HHSN272201000053C]; Lymphoma and Leukemia SCOR [7009-12]; American Academy of Allergy Asthma and Immunology; CSL-Behring; Career Award for Medical Scientists from the Burroughs Wellcome Fund","This work was supported by National Institutes of Health grants AI020047 (to F.

Bacterial infections produce pain by unknown molecular mechanisms, although they are presumed to be secondary to immune activation. Here we demonstrate that bacteria directly activate nociceptors, and that the immune response mediated through TLR2, MyD88, T cells, B cells, and neutrophils and monocytes is not necessary for Staphylococcus aureus-induced pain in mice. Mechanical and thermal hyperalgesia in mice is correlated with live bacterial load rather than tissue swelling or immune activation. Bacteria induce calcium flux and action potentials in nociceptor neurons, in part via bacterial N-formylated peptides and the pore-forming toxin alpha-haemolysin, through distinct mechanisms. Specific ablation of Nav1.8-lineage neurons, which include nociceptors, abrogated pain during bacterial infection, but concurrently increased local immune infiltration and lymphadenopathy of the draining lymph node. Thus, bacterial pathogens produce pain by directly activating sensory neurons that modulate inflammation, an unsuspected role for the nervous systemin host-pathogen interactions.","[Chiu, Isaac M.; Ghasemlou, Nader; Von Hehn, Christian A.; Tran, Johnathan; Wainger, Brian; Strominger, Amanda; Muralidharan, Sriya; Hwang, Sun Wook; Woolf, Clifford J.] Boston Childrens Hosp, Kirby Neurobiol Ctr, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Chiu, Isaac M.; Ghasemlou, Nader; Von Hehn, Christian A.; Tran, Johnathan; Wainger, Brian; Strominger, Amanda; Muralidharan, Sriya; Hwang, Sun Wook; Woolf, Clifford J.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Neurobiol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Heesters, Balthasar A.; Carroll, Michael C.] Boston Childrens Hosp, Program Cellular & Mol Med, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Heesters, Balthasar A.; Carroll, Michael C.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Heesters, Balthasar A.] Univ Med Ctr, NL-3584 CX Utrecht, Netherlands; [Zhao, Fan] Brandeis Univ, Dept Chem, Quantitat Biol Program, Waltham, MA 02454 USA; [Horswill, Alexander R.] Univ Iowa, Dept Microbiol, Roy J & Lucille A Carver Coll Med, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA; [Wardenburg, Juliane Bubeck] Univ Chicago, Dept Pediat, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Wardenburg, Juliane Bubeck] Univ Chicago, Dept Microbiol, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Hwang, Sun Wook] Korea Univ, Grad Sch Med, Seoul 136705, South Korea","Woolf, CJ (reprint author), Boston Childrens Hosp, Kirby Neurobiol Ctr, Boston, MA 02115 USA.",clifford.woolf@childrens.harvard.edu,"Zhao, Fan/A-3686-2012; Wainger, Brian/L-7553-2017","Zhao, Fan/0000-0002-6103-5608; Ghasemlou, Nader/0000-0002-1696-7342; Hwang, Sun Wook/0000-0001-8460-7480","NIH [PO1AI078897, 5RO1AI039246, R37NS039518, 5P01NS072040, 5F32NS076297]; FACS","We thank L.

However, how topoisomerases are mechanistically connected to ASD is unknown. Here we find that topotecan, a topoisomerase 1 (TOP1) inhibitor, dose-dependently reduces the expression of extremely long genes in mouse and human neurons, including nearly all genes that are longer than 200 kilobases. Expression of long genes is also reduced after knockdown of Top1 or Top2b in neurons, highlighting that both enzymes are required for full expression of long genes. By mapping RNA polymerase II density genome-wide in neurons, we found that this length-dependent effect on gene expression was due to impaired transcription elongation. Interestingly, many high-confidence ASD candidate genes are exceptionally long and were reduced in expression after TOP1 inhibition. Our findings suggest that chemicals and genetic mutations that impair topoisomerases could commonly contribute to ASD and other neurodevelopmental disorders.","[King, Ian F.; Mabb, Angela M.; Huang, Hsien-Sung; Pearson, Brandon L.; Philpot, Benjamin D.; Zylka, Mark J.] Univ N Carolina, Dept Cell Biol & Physiol, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA; [Yandava, Chandri N.; Philpot, Benjamin D.; Zylka, Mark J.] Univ N Carolina, Carolina Inst Dev Disabil, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA; [Hsiao, Jack S.; Chamberlain, Stormy J.] Univ Connecticut, Ctr Hlth, Dept Genet & Dev Biol, Farmington, CT 06032 USA; [Calabrese, J.

The key tissue targets responsible for the lethal effects of these toxins are unknown. Here we generated cell-type-specific anthrax toxin receptor capillary morphogenesis protein-2 (CMG2)-null mice and cell-type-specific CMG2-expressing mice and challenged them with the toxins. Our results show that lethality induced by LT and ET occurs through damage to distinct cell types; whereas targeting cardiomyocytes and vascular smooth muscle cells is required for LT-induced mortality, ET-induced lethality occurs mainly through its action in hepatocytes. Notably, and in contradiction to what has been previously postulated, targeting of endothelial cells by either toxin does not seem to contribute significantly to lethality. Our findings demonstrate that B. anthracis has evolved to use LT and ET to induce host lethality by coordinately damaging two distinct vital systems.","[Liu, Shihui; Zhang, Yi; Moayeri, Mahtab; Crown, Devorah; Fattah, Rasem J.; Wein, Alexander N.; Leppla, Stephen H.] NIAID, Microbial Pathogenesis Sect, Parasit Dis Lab, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Liu, Jie; Finkel, Toren] NHLBI, Ctr Mol Med, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Yu, Zu-Xi] NHLBI, Pathol Core Facil, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA","Liu, SH (reprint author), NIAID, Microbial Pathogenesis Sect, Parasit Dis Lab, NIH, 9000 Rockville Pike, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA.",shliu@niaid.nih.gov; sleppla@niaid.nih.gov,,,"National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases; National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health","This research was supported by the intramural research programs of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health.

However, until now no convincing answer has been given to the question of how to extend the scope of QKD beyond niche applications in dedicated high security networks. Here we introduce and experimentally demonstrate the concept of a 'quantum access network': based on simple and cost-effective telecommunication technologies, the scheme can greatly expand the number of users in quantum networks and therefore vastly broaden their appeal. We show that a high-speed single-photon detector positioned at a network node can be shared between up to 64 users for exchanging secret keys with the node, thereby significantly reducing the hardware requirements for each user added to the network. This point-to-multipoint architecture removes one of the main obstacles restricting the widespread application of QKD. It presents a viable method for realizing multi-user QKD networks with efficient use of resources, and brings QKD closer to becoming a widespread technology.","[Froehlich, Bernd; Dynes, James F.; Lucamarini, Marco; Sharpe, Andrew W.; Yuan, Zhiliang; Shields, Andrew J.] Toshiba Res Europe Ltd, Cambridge CB4 0GZ, England; [Froehlich, Bernd; Dynes, James F.; Lucamarini, Marco; Yuan, Zhiliang; Shields, Andrew J.] Toshiba Co Ltd, Corp Res & Dev Ctr, Saiwai Ku, Kawasaki, Kanagawa 2128582, Japan","Shields, AJ (reprint author), Toshiba Res Europe Ltd, 208 Cambridge Sci Pk, Cambridge CB4 0GZ, England.",bernd.frohlich@crl.toshiba.co.uk; zhiliang.yuan@crl.toshiba.co.uk; andrew.shields@crl.toshiba.co.uk,"Lucamarini, Marco/G-4748-2010; Yuan, Zhiliang/C-9609-2010","Lucamarini, Marco/0000-0002-7351-4622; Yuan, Zhiliang/0000-0001-5276-9151","Research and Development of Secure Photonic Network Technologies; Commissioned Research of the National Institute of Information and Communications Technology (NICT), Japan","This research is partly supported by Research and Development of Secure Photonic Network Technologies, the Commissioned Research of the National Institute of Information and Communications Technology (NICT), Japan.",,30,67,68,1,56,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,5-Sep,2013,501,7465,,,,,69,+,,10.1038/nature12493,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,211ER,WOS:000323888300033,24005413,No,,,11/20/17

The linear conductance of a point contact, when measured as function of its channel width, is quantized(1-3) in units of G(Q) = 2e(2)/h, where e is the electron charge and h is Planck's constant. However, the conductance also has an unexpected shoulder at similar to 0.7 G(Q), known as the '0.7-anomaly'(4-12), whose origin is still subject to debate(11-21). Proposed theoretical explanations have invoked spontaneous spin polarization(4,17), ferromagnetic spin coupling(19), the formation of a quasi-bound state leading to the Kondo effect(13,14), Wigner crystallization(16,20) and various treatments of inelastic scattering(18,21). However, explicit calculations that fully reproduce the various experimental observations in the regime of the 0.7-anomaly, including the zero-bias peak that typically accompanies it(6,9-11), are still lacking. Here we offer a detailed microscopic explanation for both the 0.7-anomaly and the zero-bias peak: their common origin is a smeared van Hove singularity in the local density of states at the bottom of the lowest one-dimensional subband of the point contact, which causes an anomalous enhancement in the Hartree potential barrier, the magnetic spin susceptibility and the inelastic scattering rate. We find good qualitative agreement between theoretical calculations and experimental results on the dependence of the conductance on gate voltage, magnetic field, temperature, source-drain voltage (including the zero-bias peak) and interaction strength. We also clarify how the low-energy scale governing the 0.7-anomaly depends on gate voltage and interactions. For low energies, we predict and observe Fermi-liquid behaviour similar to that associated with the Kondo effect in quantum dots(22). At high energies, however, the similarities between the 0.7-anomaly and the Kondo effect end.","[Bauer, Florian; Heyder, Jan; Schubert, Enrico; Borowsky, David; Taubert, Daniela; Bruognolo, Benedikt; von Delft, Jan; Ludwig, Stefan] Univ Munich, Ctr NanoSci, D-80539 Munich, Germany; [Bauer, Florian; Heyder, Jan; Schubert, Enrico; Borowsky, David; Taubert, Daniela; Bruognolo, Benedikt; von Delft, Jan; Ludwig, Stefan] Univ Munich, Fak Phys, D-80539 Munich, Germany; [Bauer, Florian; Heyder, Jan; Bruognolo, Benedikt; von Delft, Jan] Univ Munich, Arnold Sommerfeld Ctr Theoret Phys, D-80333 Munich, Germany; [Schuh, Dieter] Univ Regensburg, Inst Angew Phys, D-93040 Regensburg, Germany; [Wegscheider, Werner] ETH, Solid State Phys Lab, CH-8093 Zurich, Switzerland","von Delft, J (reprint author), Univ Munich, Ctr NanoSci, Geschwister Scholl Pl 1, D-80539 Munich, Germany.",vondelft@lmu.de; ludwig@lmu.de,"Ludwig, Stefan/A-5199-2009","Ludwig, Stefan/0000-0002-0978-7458","DFG [SFB-631, SFB-TR12, De730/3-2, De730/4-1, De730/4-2, De730/4-3, HO 4687/1-3, LU819/4-1]; Cluster of Excellence Nanosystems Initiative Munich; Center for NanoScience; US National Science Foundation [NSF PHY05-51164]; DFG","We thank B.

In clean channels, electron transport is ballistic and the conductance is then quantized as a function of channel width(1,2) with plateaux at integer multiples of 2e(2)/h (where e is the electron charge and h is Planck's constant). This can be understood in a picture where the electron states are propagating waves, without the need to account for electron-electron interactions. Quantized conductance could thus be the signature of ultimate control over nanoscale electron transport. However, even studies with the cleanest QPCs generically show significant anomalies in the quantized conductance traces, and there is consensus that these result from electron many-body effects(3,4). Despite extensive experimental and theoretical studies(4-11), understanding these anomalies is an open problem. Here we report that the many-body effects have their origin in one or more spontaneously localized states that emerge from Friedel oscillations in the electron charge density within the QPC channel. These localized states will have electron spins associated with them, and the Kondo effect-related to electron transport through such localized electron spins-contributes to the formation of the many-body state(5-7). We present evidence for such localization, with Kondo effects of odd or even character, directly reflecting the parity of the number of localized states; the evidence is obtained from experiments with length-tunable QPCs that show a periodic modulation of the many-body properties with Kondo signatures that alternate between odd and even Kondo effects. Our results are of importance for assessing the role of QPCs in more complex hybrid devices(12,13) and for proposals for spintronic and quantum information applications(14,15). In addition, our results show that tunable QPCs offer a versatile platform for investigating many-body effects in nanoscale systems, with the ability to probe such physics at the level of a single site.","[Iqbal, M.

Although it is widely appreciated that the iron-rich cofactors of nitrogenase enzymes facilitate this transformation(2-5), how they do so remains poorly understood. A central element of debate has been the exact site or sites of N-2 coordination and reduction(6,7). In synthetic inorganic chemistry, an early emphasis was placed on molybdenum(8) because it was thought to be an essential element of nitrogenases(3) and because it had been established that well-defined molybdenum model complexes could mediate the stoichiometric conversion of N-2 to NH3 (ref. 9). This chemical transformation can be performed in a catalytic fashion by two well-defined molecular systems that feature molybdenum centres(10,11). However, it is now thought that iron is the only transition metal essential to all nitrogenases(3), and recent biochemical and spectroscopic data have implicated iron instead of molybdenum as the site of N-2 binding in the FeMo-cofactor(12). Here we describe a tris(phosphine) borane-supported iron complex that catalyses the reduction of N-2 to NH3 under mild conditions, and in which more than 40 per cent of the proton and reducing equivalents are delivered to N-2. Our results indicate that a single iron site may be capable of stabilizing the various NxHy intermediates generated during catalytic NH3 formation. Geometric tunability at iron imparted by a flexible iron-boron interaction in our model system seems to be important for efficient catalysis(13-15).

This asymmetric warming is expected to affect carbon assimilation and consumption in plants, because photosynthesis in most plants occurs during daytime and is more sensitive to the maximum daily temperature, T-max, whereas plant respiration occurs throughout the day(2) and is therefore influenced by both T-max and the minimum daily temperature, T-min. Most studies of the response of terrestrial ecosystems to climate warming, however, ignore this asymmetric forcing effect on vegetation growth and carbon dioxide (CO2) fluxes(3-6). Here we analyse the interannual covariations of the satellite-derived normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI, an indicator of vegetation greenness) with Tmax and Tmin over the Northern Hemisphere. After removing the correlation between Tmax and Tmin, we find that the partial correlation between Tmax and NDVI is positive in most wet and cool ecosystems over boreal regions, but negative in dry temperate regions. In contrast, the partial correlation between Tmin and NDVI is negative in boreal regions, and exhibits a more complex behaviour in dry temperate regions. We detect similar patterns in terrestrial net CO2 exchange maps obtained from a global atmospheric inversion model. Additional analysis of the long-term atmospheric CO2 concentration record of the station Point Barrow in Alaska suggests that the peak-to-peak amplitude of CO2 increased by 23 +/- 11% for a +1 degrees C anomaly in T-max from May to September over lands north of 51 degrees N, but decreased by 28 +/- 14% for a +1 degrees C anomaly in T-min. These lines of evidence suggest that asymmetric diurnal warming, a process that is currently not taken into account in many global carbon cycle models, leads to a divergent response of Northern Hemisphere vegetation growth and carbon sequestration to rising temperatures.","[Peng, Shushi; Piao, Shilong] Peking Univ, Coll Urban & Environm Sci, Sinofrench Inst Earth Syst Sci, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China; [Piao, Shilong; Zhang, Gengxin; Wang, Shiping] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Tibetan Plateau Res, Beijing 100085, Peoples R China; [Ciais, Philippe; Chevallier, Frederic] CEA, CNRS, LSCE, CE, F-91191 Gif Sur Yvette, France; [Myneni, Ranga B.] Boston Univ, Dept Earth & Environm, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Chen, Anping] Princeton Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Dolman, Albertus J.] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Dept Earth Sci, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Janssens, Ivan A.; Vicca, Sara] Univ Antwerp, Dept Biol, B-2610 Antwerp, Belgium; [Penuelas, Josep] CREAF, Barcelona 08193, Catalonia, Spain; [Penuelas, Josep] UAB, CSIC, CEAB, Global Ecol Unit,CREAF, Barcelona 08193, Catalonia, Spain; [Wan, Shiqiang] Henan Univ, Coll Life Sci, Kaifeng 475001, Peoples R China; [Zeng, Hui] Peking Univ, Shenzhen Grad Sch, Shenzhen 518055, Peoples R China","Piao, SL (reprint author), Peking Univ, Coll Urban & Environm Sci, Sinofrench Inst Earth Syst Sci, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China.",slpiao@pku.edu.cn; zengh@pkusz.edu.cn,"Wan, Shiqiang/B-5799-2009; Myneni, Ranga/F-5129-2012; Peng, Shushi/J-4779-2014; Chen, Anping/H-9960-2014; Chevallier, Frederic/E-9608-2016; Penuelas, Josep/D-9704-2011; Vicca, Sara/I-3637-2012; Janssens, Ivan/P-1331-2014","Peng, Shushi/0000-0001-5098-726X; Chevallier, Frederic/0000-0002-4327-3813; Penuelas, Josep/0000-0002-7215-0150; Vicca, Sara/0000-0001-9812-5837; Janssens, Ivan/0000-0002-5705-1787; Dolman, A.J./0000-0003-0099-0457","National Natural Science Foundation of China [41125004, 31021001]; National Basic Research Program of China [2010CB950601, 2013CB956303]; Foundation for Sino-EU Research Cooperation of the Ministry of Science and Technology of China [1003]; Chinese Ministry of Environmental Protection [201209031]","This study was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (grant numbers 41125004 and 31021001), the National Basic Research Program of China (grant numbers 2010CB950601 and 2013CB956303), the Foundation for Sino-EU Research Cooperation of the Ministry of Science and Technology of China (grant number 1003), and a Chinese Ministry of Environmental Protection Grant (number 201209031).

However, relatively little is known of the early evolutionary history of the hyperinflated brain that distinguishes birds from other living reptiles and provides the important neurological capablities required by flight(2). Here we use high-resolution computed tomography to estimate and compare cranial volumes of extant birds, the early avialan Archaeopteryx lithographica, and a number of non-avian maniraptoran dinosaurs that are phylogenetically close to the origins of both Avialae and avian flight. Previous work established that avian cerebral expansion began early in theropod history and that the cranial cavity of Archaeopteryx was volumetrically intermediate between these early forms and modern birds(3,4). Our new data indicate that the relative size of the cranial cavity of Archaeopteryx is reflective of a more generalized maniraptoran volumetric signature and in several instances is actually smaller than that of other non-avian dinosaurs. Thus, bird-like encephalization indices evolved multiple times, supporting the conclusion that if Archaeopteryx had the neurological capabilities required of flight, so did at least some other non-avian maniraptorans. This is congruent with recent findings that avialans were not unique among maniraptorans in their ability to fly in some form(5,6).","[Balanoff, Amy M.; Bever, Gabe S.; Norell, Mark A.] Amer Museum Nat Hist, Div Paleontol, New York, NY 10024 USA; [Balanoff, Amy M.] Columbia Univ, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Bever, Gabe S.] SUNY Coll Old Westbury, New York Inst Technol, Old Westbury, NY 11568 USA; [Rowe, Timothy B.] Univ Texas Austin, Jackson Sch Geosci, Austin, TX 78712 USA","Balanoff, AM (reprint author), SUNY Stony Brook, Sch Med, Dept Anat Sci, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA.",abalanoff@gmail.com,,,"NSF DDIG [DEB 0909970]; NSF [IIS-0208675, EAR-0948842]; Columbia University International Travel Fellowship","Funding for this project was provided by a NSF DDIG (DEB 0909970) to A.

Humans regularly challenge these control processes when attempting to simultaneously accomplish multiple goals (multitasking), generating interference as the result of fundamental information processing limitations(2). It is clear that multitasking behaviour has become ubiquitous in today's technologically dense world(3), and substantial evidence has accrued regarding multitasking difficulties and cognitive control deficits in our ageing population(4). Here we show that multitasking performance, as assessed with a custom-designed three-dimensional video game (NeuroRacer), exhibits a linear age-related decline from 20 to 79 years of age. By playing an adaptive version of NeuroRacer in multitasking training mode, older adults (60 to 85 years old) reduced multitasking costs compared to both an active control group and a no-contact control group, attaining levels beyond those achieved by untrained 20-year-old participants, with gains persisting for 6 months. Furthermore, age-related deficits in neural signatures of cognitive control, as measured with electroencephalography, were remediated by multitasking training (enhanced midline frontal theta power and frontal-posterior theta coherence). Critically, this training resulted in performance benefits that extended to untrained cognitive control abilities (enhanced sustained attention and working memory), with an increase in midline frontal theta power predicting the training-induced boost in sustained attention and preservation of multitasking improvement 6 months later. These findings highlight the robust plasticity of the prefrontal cognitive control system in the ageing brain, and provide the first evidence, to our knowledge, of how a custom-designed video game can be used to assess cognitive abilities across the lifespan, evaluate underlying neural mechanisms, and serve as a powerful tool for cognitive enhancement.","[Anguera, J.

This process requires the cellular prion protein (PrPC; ref. 1), which contains a globular domain hinged to a long amino-proximal flexible tail(2). Here we describe rapid neurotoxicity in mice and cerebellar organotypic cultured slices exposed to ligands targeting the alpha 1 and alpha 3 helices of the PrPC globular domain. Ligands included seven distinct monoclonal antibodies(3), monovalent Fab(1) fragments and recombinant single-chain variable fragment miniantibodies. Similar to prion infections(4-6), the toxicity of globular domain ligands required neuronal PrPC, was exacerbated by PrPC overexpression, was associated with calpain activation and was antagonized by calpain inhibitors. Neurodegeneration was accompanied by a burst of reactive oxygen species, and was suppressed by antioxidants. Furthermore, genetic ablation of the superoxide-producing enzyme NOX2 (also known as CYBB) protected mice from globular domain ligand toxicity. We also found that neurotoxicity was prevented by deletions of the octapeptide repeats within the flexible tail. These deletions did not appreciably compromise globular domain antibody binding, suggesting that the flexible tail is required to transmit toxic signals that originate from the globular domain and trigger oxidative stress and calpain activation. Supporting this view, various octapeptide ligands were not only innocuous to both cerebellar organotypic cultured slices and mice, but also prevented the toxicity of globular domain ligands while not interfering with their binding. We conclude that PrPC consists of two functionally distinct modules, with the globular domain and the flexible tail exerting regulatory and executive functions, respectively. Octapeptide ligands also prolonged the life of mice expressing the toxic PrPC mutant(7), PrP(Lambda 94-134), indicating that the flexible tail mediates toxicity in two distinct PrPC-related conditions. Flexible tail-mediated toxicity may conceivably play a role in further prion pathologies, such as familial Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in humans bearing supernumerary octapeptides.","[Sonati, Tiziana; Reimann, Regina R.; Falsig, Jeppe; O'Connor, Tracy; Hornemann, Simone; Yaganoglu, Sine; Li, Bei; Herrmann, Uli S.; Aguzzi, Adriano] Univ Zurich Hosp, Inst Neuropathol, CH-8091 Zurich, Switzerland; [Baral, Pravas Kumar; Wieland, Barbara; Swayampakula, Mridula; James, Michael N.

Here we tested whether the induction of adult stem cells could repair chemoradiation-induced tissue injury and prolong overall survival in mice. We found that intestinal stem cells (ISCs)(2) expressed Slit2 and its single-span transmembrane cell-surface receptor roundabout 1 (Robo1)(3,4). Partial genetic deletion of Robo1 decreased ISC numbers and caused villus hypotrophy, whereas a Slit2 transgene increased ISC numbers and triggered villus hypertrophy. During lethal dosages of chemoradiation, administering a short pulse of R-spondin 1 (Rspo1; a Wnt agonist)(5-14) plus Slit2 reduced ISC loss, mitigated gut impairment and protected animals from death, without concomitantly decreasing tumour sensitivity to chemotherapy. Therefore Rspo1 and Slit2 may act as therapeutic adjuvants to enhance host tolerance to aggressive chemoradiotherapy for eradicating metastatic cancers.","[Zhou, Wei-Jie; Geng, Zhen H.; Geng, Jian-Guo] Univ Michigan, Sch Dent, Dept Biol & Mat Sci, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Spence, Jason R.] Univ Michigan, Sch Med, Dept Cell & Dev Biol, Div Gastroenterol, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Spence, Jason R.] Univ Michigan, Sch Med, Dept Internal Med, Div Gastroenterol, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA","Geng, JG (reprint author), Univ Michigan, Sch Dent, Dept Biol & Mat Sci, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",jgeng@umich.edu,,,National Institutes of Health [CA126897],"We thank L.

The obese individuals among the lower bacterial richness group also gain more weight over time. Only a few bacterial species are sufficient to distinguish between individuals with high and low bacterial richness, and even between lean and obese participants.

The favoured hypothesis is that they are produced by a relativistic jet created by the merger of two compact stellar objects (specifically two neutron stars or a neutron star and a black hole). This is supported by indirect evidence such as the properties of their host galaxies(3), but unambiguous confirmation of the model is still lacking. Mergers of this kind are also expected to create significant quantities of neutron-rich radioactive species(4,5), whose decay should result in a faint transient, known as a 'kilonova', in the days following the burst(6-8). Indeed, it is speculated that this mechanism may be the predominant source of stable r-process elements in the Universe(5,9). Recent calculations suggest that much of the kilonova energy should appear in the near-infrared spectral range, because of the high optical opacity created by these heavy r-process elements(10-13). Here we report optical and near-infrared observations that provide strong evidence for such an event accompanying the short-duration gamma-ray burst GRB130603B. If this, the simplest interpretation of the data, is correct, then it confirms that compact-object mergers are the progenitors of short-duration gamma-ray bursts and the sites of significant production of r-process elements. It also suggests that kilonovae offer an alternative, unbeamed electromagnetic signature of the most promising sources for direct detection of gravitational waves.","[Tanvir, N.

If convection(5,6) is occurring, the rigid portion of the shell is expected to be thin; similarly, a weak, isostatically compensated shell has been proposed(7,8) to explain the observed topography. Here we report a strong inverse correlation between gravity(3) and topography(9) at long wavelengths that are not dominated by tides and rotation. We argue that negative gravity anomalies (mass deficits) produced by crustal thickening at the base of the ice shell overwhelm positive gravity anomalies (mass excesses) produced by the small surface topography, giving rise to this inverse correlation. We show that this situation requires a substantially rigid ice shell with an elastic thickness exceeding 40 kilometres, and hundreds of metres of surface erosion and deposition, consistent with recent estimates from local features(10,11). Our results are therefore not compatible with a geologically active, low-rigidity ice shell. After extrapolating to wavelengths that are controlled by tides and rotation, we suggest that Titan's moment of inertia may be even higher (that is, Titan may be even less centrally condensed) than is currently thought(12).","[Hemingway, D.; Nimmo, F.] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA; [Zebker, H.] Stanford Univ, Dept Geophys, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Zebker, H.] Stanford Univ, Dept Elect Engn, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Iess, L.] Univ Roma La Sapienza, Dipartimento Ingn Meccan & Aerospaziale, I-00184 Rome, Italy","Hemingway, D (reprint author), Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, 1156 High St, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA.",djheming@ucsc.edu,"Hemingway, Douglas/F-6332-2014; IESS, Luciano/F-4902-2011","Hemingway, Douglas/0000-0001-5617-207X; IESS, Luciano/0000-0002-6230-5825","NASA [NNX13AG02G, NNX11AK44G]","We thank the Cassini radar science team, M.

It was introduced to investigate many-body phenomena related to frustration and disorder in a material that could be tailored to precise specifications and imaged directly. Because of the large magnetic energy scales of these nanoscale islands, it has so far been impossible to thermally anneal artificial spin ice into desired thermodynamic ensembles; nearly all studies of artificial spin ice have either treated it as a granular material activated by alternating fields(2) or focused on the as-grown state of the arrays(3). This limitation has prevented experimental investigation of novel phases that can emerge from the nominal ground states of frustrated lattices. For example, artificial kagome spin ice, in which the islands are arranged on the edges of a hexagonal net, is predicted to support states with monopolar charge order at entropies below that of the previously observed pseudo-ice manifold(4). Here we demonstrate a method for thermalizing artificial spin ices with square and kagome lattices by heating above the Curie temperature of the constituent material. In this manner, artificial square spin ice achieves unprecedented thermal ordering of the moments. In artificial kagome spin ice, we observe incipient crystallization of the magnetic charges embedded in pseudo-ice, with crystallites of magnetic charges whose size can be controlled by tuning the lattice constant. We find excellent agreement between experimental data and Monte Carlo simulations of emergent charge-charge interactions.","[Zhang, Sheng; Lammert, Paul E.; Crespi, Vincent H.] Penn State Univ, Dept Phys, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Zhang, Sheng; Lammert, Paul E.; Crespi, Vincent H.] Penn State Univ, Mat Res Inst, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Gilbert, Ian; Schiffer, Peter] Univ Illinois, Dept Phys, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Gilbert, Ian; Schiffer, Peter] Univ Illinois, Frederick Seitz Mat Res Lab, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Nisoli, Cristiano; Chern, Gia-Wei] Los Alamos Natl Lab, Div Theoret, Los Alamos, NM 87545 USA; [Erickson, Michael J.; O'Brien, Liam; Leighton, Chris] Univ Minnesota, Dept Chem Engn & Mat Sci, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA; [O'Brien, Liam] Univ Cambridge, Cavendish Lab, Dept Phys, Thin Film Magnetism Grp, Cambridge CB3 0HE, England","Schiffer, P (reprint author), Univ Illinois, Dept Phys, 1110 W Green St, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.",pschiffe@illinois.edu,"O'Brien, Liam/H-1994-2012; Zhang, Sheng/M-9238-2014","O'Brien, Liam/0000-0002-0136-8603; Zhang, Sheng/0000-0002-9710-6738; Gilbert, Ian/0000-0001-8259-0697; Schiffer, Peter/0000-0002-6430-6549; Crespi, Vincent/0000-0003-3846-3193; Nisoli, Cristiano/0000-0003-0053-1023","US Department of Energy, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division [DE-SC0005313]; US Department of Energy at LANL [DE-AC52-06NA253962]; NSF MRSEC [DMR-0819885, DMR-0820404]; EU Marie Curie IOF [299376]","This project was funded by the US Department of Energy, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division under grant no.

The long-term adaptation of these and other marine algae to decreasing carbon dioxide levels during the Cenozoic era(1) has resulted in modern algae capable of actively enhancing carbon dioxide at the site of photosynthesis. This enhancement occurs through the transport of dissolved bicarbonate (HCO3-) and with the help of enzymes whose expression can be modulated by variable aqueous carbon dioxide concentration, [CO2], in laboratory cultures(2,3). Coccolithophores preserve the geological history of this adaptation because the stable carbon and oxygen isotopic compositions of their calcite plates (coccoliths), which are preserved in the fossil record, are sensitive to active carbon uptake and transport by the cell. Here we use a model of cellular carbon fluxes and show that at low [CO2] the increased demand for HCO3- at the site of photosynthesis results in a diminished allocation of HCO3- to calcification, which is most pronounced in larger cells. This results in a large divergence between the carbon isotopic compositions of small versus large coccoliths only at low [CO2]. Our evaluation of the oxygen and carbon isotope record of size-separated fossil coccoliths reveals that this isotopic divergence first arose during the late Miocene to the earliest Pliocene epoch (about 7-5 million years ago). We interpret this to be a threshold response of the cells' carbon acquisition strategies to decreasing [CO2]. The documented coccolithophore response is synchronous with a global shift in terrestrial vegetation distribution between 8 and 5 Myr ago, which has been interpreted by some studies as a floral response to decreasing partial pressures of carbon dioxide (p(CO2)) in the atmosphere(4-6). We infer a global decrease in carbon dioxide levels for this time interval that has not yet been identified in the sparse p(CO2) proxy record(7) but is synchronous with global cooling and progressive glaciations(8,9).","[Bolton, Clara T.; Stoll, Heather M.] Univ Oviedo, Dept Geol, E-33005 Oviedo, Asturias, Spain","Bolton, CT (reprint author), Univ Oviedo, Dept Geol, Jesus Arias de Velasco S-N, E-33005 Oviedo, Asturias, Spain.",cbolton@geol.uniovi.es; hstoll@geol.uniovi.es,"Stoll, Heather/G-9066-2012","Stoll, Heather/0000-0002-2953-7835",US National Science Foundation; European Research Council [UE-09-ERC-2009-STG-240222-PACE]; DuPont Young Professor Award,"We thank L.

Thinning has also been reported along the margin of the much larger East Antarctic ice sheet(1), but whether glaciers are advancing or retreating there is largely unknown, and there has been no attempt to place such changes in the context of localized mass loss(7,9) or climatic or oceanic forcing. Here we present multidecadal trends in the terminus position of 175 ocean-terminating outlet glaciers along 5,400 kilometres of the margin of the East Antarctic ice sheet, and reveal widespread and synchronous changes. Despite large fluctuations between glaciers-linked to their size-three epochal patterns emerged: 63 per cent of glaciers retreated from 1974 to 1990, 72 per cent advanced from 1990 to 2000, and 58 per cent advanced from 2000 to 2010. These trends were most pronounced along the warmer western South Pacific coast, whereas glaciers along the cooler Ross Sea coast experienced no significant changes. We find that glacier change along the Pacific coast is consistent with a rapid and coherent response to air temperature and sea-ice trends, linked through the dominant mode of atmospheric variability (the Southern Annular Mode). We conclude that parts of the world's largest ice sheet may be more vulnerable to external forcing than recognized previously.","[Miles, B. W. J.; Stokes, C. R.; Vieli, A.; Cox, N.

AOM coupled to iron(1), manganese(1) and sulphate(2) reduction have been demonstrated in consortia containing anaerobic methanotrophic (ANME) archaea. More recently it has been shown that the bacterium Candidatus 'Methylomirabilis oxyfera' can couple AOM to nitrite reduction through an intra-aerobic methane oxidation pathway(3). Bioreactors capable of AOM coupled to denitrification have resulted in the enrichment of 'M. oxyfera' and a novel ANME lineage, ANME-2d(4,5). However, as 'M. oxyfera' can independently couple AOM to denitrification, the role of ANME-2d in the process is unresolved. Here, a bioreactor fed with nitrate, ammonium and methane was dominated by a single ANME-2d population performing nitrate-driven AOM. Metagenomic, single-cell genomic and metatranscriptomic analyses combined with bioreactor performance and C-13- and N-15-labelling experiments show that ANME-2d is capable of independent AOM through reverse methanogenesis using nitrate as the terminal electron acceptor. Comparative analyses reveal that the genes for nitrate reduction were transferred laterally from a bacterial donor, suggesting selection for this novel process within ANME-2d. Nitrite produced by ANME-2d is reduced to dinitrogen gas through a syntrophic relationship with an anaerobic ammonium-oxidizing bacterium, effectively outcompeting 'M. oxyfera' in the system. We propose the name Candidatus 'Methanoperedens nitror-educens' for the ANME-2d population and the family Candidatus 'Methanoperedenaceae' for the ANME-2d lineage. We predict that 'M. nitroreducens' and other members of the 'Methanoperedenaceae' have an important role in linking the global carbon and nitrogen cycles in anoxic environments.","[Haroon, Mohamed F.; Imelfort, Michael; Hugenholtz, Philip; Tyson, Gene W.] Univ Queensland, Sch Chem & Mol Biosci, Australian Ctr Ecogen, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia; [Hu, Shihu; Shi, Ying; Imelfort, Michael; Keller, Jurg; Yuan, Zhiguo; Tyson, Gene W.] Univ Queensland, Adv Water Management Ctr, Fac Engn Architecture & Informat Technol, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia; [Hugenholtz, Philip] Univ Queensland, Inst Mol Biosci, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia","Tyson, GW (reprint author), Univ Queensland, Sch Chem & Mol Biosci, Australian Ctr Ecogen, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia.",z.yuan@awmc.uq.edu.au; g.tyson@uq.edu.au,"Tyson, Gene/C-6558-2013; Hugenholtz, Philip/G-9608-2011","Hugenholtz, Philip/0000-0001-5386-7925; Keller, Jurg/0000-0001-6796-0936; yuan, zhiguo/0000-0002-7566-1482","Australian Research Council (ARC) [DP0666762, DP0987204]; Australian Centre for Ecogenomics; ARC Queen Elizabeth II Fellowship [DP1093175]; ARC Discovery Outstanding Researcher Award [DP120103498]; China Scholarship Council","We thank the ACE sequencing team; M.

This is central to understanding the spectra of mutations recovered in the evolution of antibiotic resistance(1), the response of pathogens to immune selection(2,3), and the dynamics of cancer progression(4,5). In laboratory evolution experiments, demonstrably beneficial mutations are found repeatedly(6-8), but are often accompanied by other mutations with no obvious benefit. Here we use whole-genome whole-population sequencing to examine the dynamics of genome sequence evolution at high temporal resolution in 40 replicate Saccharomyces cerevisiae populations growing in rich medium for 1,000 generations. We find pervasive genetic hitchhiking: multiple mutations arise and move synchronously through the population as mutational 'cohorts'. Multiple clonal cohorts are often present simultaneously, competing with each other in the same population. Our results show that patterns of sequence evolution are driven by a balance between these chance effects of hitchhiking and interference, which increase stochastic variation in evolutionary outcomes, and the deterministic action of selection on individual mutations, which favours parallel evolutionary solutions in replicate populations.","[Lang, Gregory I.; Botstein, David] Princeton Univ, Lewis Sigler Inst Integrat Genom, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Lang, Gregory I.; Botstein, David] Princeton Univ, Dept Mol Biol, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Rice, Daniel P.; Desai, Michael M.] Harvard Univ, Dept Organism & Evolutionary Biol, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Rice, Daniel P.; Desai, Michael M.] Harvard Univ, Dept Phys, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Rice, Daniel P.; Desai, Michael M.] Harvard Univ, FAS Ctr Syst Biol, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Hickman, Mark J.] Rowan Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Glassboro, NJ 08028 USA; [Hickman, Mark J.] Rowan Univ, Dept Chem & Biochem, Glassboro, NJ 08028 USA; [Sodergren, Erica; Weinstock, George M.] Washington Univ, Sch Med, Genome Inst, St Louis, MO 63108 USA","Lang, GI (reprint author), Lehigh Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Bethlehem, PA 18015 USA.",glang@lehigh.edu; mmdesai@fas.harvard.edu,,"Hickman, Mark/0000-0003-3643-8023",NSF; NIGMS Centers of Excellence [GM071508]; NIH [GM046406]; James S.

The phasic spike activity of dopamine-containing neurons, and corresponding dopamine transients in the striatum, are thought to underlie these predictions, encoding positive and negative reward prediction errors(1-5). However, many behaviours are directed towards distant goals, for which transient signals may fail to provide sustained drive. Here we report an extended mode of reward-predictive dopamine signalling in the striatum that emerged as rats moved towards distant goals. These dopamine signals, which were detected with fast-scan cyclic voltammetry (FSCV), gradually increased or-in rare instances-decreased as the animals navigated mazes to reach remote rewards, rather than having phasic or steady tonic profiles. These dopamine increases (ramps) scaled flexibly with both the distance and size of the rewards. During learning, these dopamine signals showed spatial preferences for goals in different locations and readily changed in magnitude to reflect changing values of the distant rewards. Such prolonged dopamine signalling could provide sustained motivational drive, a control mechanism that may be important for normal behaviour and that can be impaired in a range of neurologic and neuropsychiatric disorders.","[Howe, Mark W.; Tierney, Patrick L.; Graybiel, Ann M.] MIT, McGovern Inst Brain Res, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Howe, Mark W.; Tierney, Patrick L.; Graybiel, Ann M.] MIT, Dept Brain & Cognit Sci, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Sandberg, Stefan G.; Phillips, Paul E.

Preferred temperature selection promotes avoidance of adverse thermal environments in the short term and maintenance of optimal body temperatures over the long term(1,2), but its molecular and cellular basis is largely unknown. Recent studies have generated conflicting views of thermal preference in Drosophila, attributing importance to either internal(3) or peripheral(4) warmth sensors. Here we reconcile these views by showing that thermal preference is not a singular response, but involves multiple systems relevant in different contexts. We found previously that the transient receptor potential channel TRPA1 acts internally to control the slowly developing preference response of flies exposed to a shallow thermal gradient(3). We now find that the rapid response of flies exposed to a steep warmth gradient does not require TRPA1; rather, the gustatory receptor GR28B(D) drives this behaviour through peripheral thermosensors. Gustatory receptors are a large gene family, widely studied in insect gustation and olfaction, and are implicated in host-seeking by insect disease vectors(5-7), but have not previously been implicated in thermosensation. At the molecular level, GR28B(D) misexpression confers thermosensitivity upon diverse cell types, suggesting that it is a warmth sensor. These data reveal a new type of thermosensory molecule and uncover a functional distinction between peripheral and internal warmth sensors in this tiny ectotherm reminiscent of thermoregulatory systems in larger, endothermic animals(2). The use of multiple, distinct molecules to respond to a given temperature, as observed here, may facilitate independent tuning of an animal's distinct thermosensory responses.","[Ni, Lina; Bronk, Peter; Chang, Elaine C.; Lowell, April M.; Flam, Juliette O.; Panzano, Vincent C.; Griffith, Leslie C.; Garrity, Paul A.] Brandeis Univ, Natl Ctr Behav Genom, Waltham, MA 02454 USA; [Ni, Lina; Bronk, Peter; Chang, Elaine C.; Lowell, April M.; Flam, Juliette O.; Panzano, Vincent C.; Griffith, Leslie C.; Garrity, Paul A.] Brandeis Univ, Dept Biol, Volen Ctr Complex Syst, Waltham, MA 02454 USA; [Theobald, Douglas L.] Brandeis Univ, Dept Biochem, Waltham, MA 02454 USA","Garrity, PA (reprint author), Brandeis Univ, Natl Ctr Behav Genom, Waltham, MA 02454 USA.",pgarrity@brandeis.edu,"Theobald, Douglas/F-3514-2013","Theobald, Douglas/0000-0002-2695-8343; Griffith, Leslie/0000-0003-3164-9876",National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [EUREKA R01 MH094721]; National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) [PO1 NS044232]; National Science Foundation [IOS-1025307]; National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) [R01 GM054408]; NIMH [R01 MH067284]; NIGMS [R01 GM094468]; NINDS National Research Service Award,"We thank the Garrity laboratory, C.

The composition of the gut microbiota can determine the efficacy of energy harvest from food(2-4) and changes in dietary composition have been associated with changes in the composition of gut microbial populations(5,6). The capacity to explore microbiota composition was markedly improved by the development of metagenomic approaches(7,8), which have already allowed production of the first human gut microbial gene catalogue(9) and stratifying individuals by their gut genomic profile into different enterotypes(10), but the analyses were carried out mainly in nonintervention settings. To investigate the temporal relationships between food intake, gut microbiota and metabolic and inflammatory phenotypes, we conducted diet-induced weight-loss and weight-stabilization interventions in a study sample of 38 obese and 11 overweight individuals. Here we report that individuals with reduced microbial gene richness (40%) present more pronounced dys-metabolism and low-grade inflammation, as observed concomitantly in the accompanying paper(11). Dietary intervention improves low gene richness and clinical phenotypes, but seems to be less efficient for inflammation variables in individuals with lower gene richness. Low gene richness may therefore have predictive potential for the efficacy of intervention.","[Cotillard, Aurelie; Kong, Ling Chun; Prifti, Edi; Rizkalla, Salwa; Zucker, Jean-Daniel; Clement, Karine] Ctr Rech Cordeliers, Inst Natl Sante & Rech Med, U872, Equipe 7, F-75006 Paris, France; [Cotillard, Aurelie; Kong, Ling Chun; Prifti, Edi; Rizkalla, Salwa; Zucker, Jean-Daniel; Clement, Karine] Univ Paris 06, F-75006 Paris, France; [Kennedy, Sean P.; Prifti, Edi; Pons, Nicolas; Le Chatelier, Emmanuelle; Almeida, Mathieu; Quinquis, Benoit; Levenez, Florence; Galleron, Nathalie; Batto, Jean-Michel; Dore, Joel; Ehrlich, Stanislav Dusko] INRA, Metagenopolis, F-78350 Jouy En Josas, France; [Kong, Ling Chun; Gougis, Sophie; Rizkalla, Salwa; Clement, Karine] CRNH Ile France, AP HP, Inst Cardiometab & Nutr, F-75013 Paris, France; [Levenez, Florence; Batto, Jean-Michel; Renault, Pierre; Dore, Joel] INRA, UMR Micalis 1319, F-78350 Jouy En Josas, France; [Zucker, Jean-Daniel] France Nord, UMMISCO, IRD, UMI 209, F-93143 Bondy, France","Ehrlich, SD (reprint author), INRA, F-78350 Jouy En Josas, France.",karine.clement@psl.aphp.fr; dusko.ehrlich@jouy.inra.fr,"Blottiere, Herve/C-6120-2011; Henegar, Corneliu/K-9166-2013; Lepage, Patricia/D-4362-2014; ZUCKER, Jean-Daniel /K-3008-2016; LE CHATELIER, Emmanuelle/O-1243-2017; Clement, karine/R-1120-2017","Blottiere, Herve/0000-0002-8390-0607; Henegar, Corneliu/0000-0002-8486-5591; ZUCKER, Jean-Daniel /0000-0002-5597-7922; LE CHATELIER, Emmanuelle/0000-0002-2724-0536; Loux, Valentin/0000-0002-8268-915X","Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR MICRO-Obes, ANR, Nutra2sens) [ANR-10-IAHU-05]; Metagenopolis grant [ANR-11-DPBS-0001]; KOT-Ceprodi (Florence Massiera); Danone Research (Damien Paineau); association Fondacoeur; association Louis-Bonduelle; European Commission [HEALTH-F4-2007-201052]; METACARDIS","We are grateful to O.

We show that CPPs arise from cardiac progenitors before lung development. Lineage tracing and clonal analysis demonstrates that CPPs generate the mesoderm lineages within the cardiac inflow tract and lung including cardiomyocytes, pulmonary vascular and airway smooth muscle, proximal vascular endothelium, and pericyte-like cells. CPPs are regulated by hedgehog expression from the foregut endoderm, which is required for connection of the pulmonary vasculature to the heart.

We report here a comprehensive analysis of transcriptome dynamics from oocyte to morula in both human and mouse embryos, using single-cell RNA sequencing. Based on single-nucleotide variants in human blastomere messenger RNAs and paternal-specific single-nucleotide polymorphisms, we identify novel stage-specific monoallelic expression patterns for a significant portion of polymorphic gene transcripts (25 to 53%). By weighted gene co-expression network analysis(5,6), we find that each developmental stage can be delineated concisely by a small number of functional modules of co-expressed genes. This result indicates a sequential order of transcriptional changes in pathways of cell cycle, gene regulation, translation and metabolism, acting in a step-wise fashion from cleavage to morula. Cross-species comparisons with mouse pre-implantation embryos reveal that the majority of human stage-specific modules (7 out of 9) are notably preserved, but developmental specificity and timing differ between human and mouse. Furthermore, we identify conserved key members (or hub genes) of the human and mouse networks. These genes represent novel candidates that are likely to be key in driving mammalian pre-implantation development.

The androgen receptor regulates a large repertoire of genes central to the identity and behaviour of prostate cancer cells(2), and functions in a ligand-independent fashion in many prostate cancers when they become hormone refractory after initial androgen deprivation therapy(3). Here we report that two lncRNAs highly overexpressed in aggressive prostate cancer, PRNCR1 (also known as PCAT8) and PCGEM1, bind successively to the androgen receptor and strongly enhance both ligand-dependent and ligand-independent androgen-receptor-mediated gene activation programs and proliferation in prostate cancer cells. Binding of PRNCR1 to the carboxy-terminally acetylated androgen receptor on enhancers and its association with DOT1L appear to be required for recruitment of the second lncRNA, PCGEM1, to the androgen receptor amino terminus that is methylated by DOT1L. Unexpectedly, recognition of specific protein marks by PCGEM1-recruited pygopus 2 PHD domain enhances selective looping of androgen-receptor-bound enhancers to target gene promoters in these cells. In 'resistant' prostate cancer cells, these overexpressed lncRNAs can interact with, and are required for, the robust activation of both truncated and full-length androgen receptor, causing ligand-independent activation of the androgen receptor transcriptional program and cell proliferation. Conditionally expressed short hairpin RNA targeting these lncRNAs in castration-resistant prostate cancer cell lines strongly suppressed tumour xenograft growth in vivo. Together, these results indicate that these overexpressed lncRNAs can potentially serve as a required component of castration-resistance in prostatic tumours.","[Yang, Liuqing; Lin, Chunru; Jin, Chunyu; Tanasa, Bogdan; Li, Wenbo; Merkurjev, Daria; Ohgi, Kenneth A.; Zhang, Jie; Rosenfeld, Michael G.] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Med, Howard Hughes Med Inst, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Yang, Liuqing; Lin, Chunru] Univ Texas MD Anderson Canc Ctr, Dept Mol & Cellular Oncol, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Yang, Joy C.; Evans, Christopher P.] Univ Calif Davis, Sch Med, Dept Urol, Sacramento, CA 95817 USA; [Tanasa, Bogdan] Scripps Res Inst, Grad Program, Kellogg Sch Sci & Technol, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; [Merkurjev, Daria] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Bioengn, Bioinformat & Syst Biol Program, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Meng, Da] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Biol Sci, Neurosci Grad Program, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA","Rosenfeld, MG (reprint author), Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Med, Howard Hughes Med Inst, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.",lyang7@mdanderson.org; clin2@mdanderson.org; mrosenfeld@ucsd.edu,"Jin, Chunyu/A-4506-2016",,"National Institutes of Health (NIH) [DK039949, DK18477, NS034934, CA173903]; Department of Defense [PC111467, SV2C-AACR-DT0812]; Prostate Cancer Foundation; NIH Pathway to Independence Award [1K99DK094981-01, 4R00CA166527-02]; US Army Medical Research and Material Command Era of Hope Postdoctoral award [W81XWH-08-1-0554]; Cancer Prevention Research Institute of Texas First-time Faculty Recruitment Award [R1218]; Cancer Research Institute Postdoctoral Fellowship","We are grateful to X.

Mitosis is initiated by a bistable system of regulatory proteins centred on Cdk1 (refs 1, 2), raising the possibility that this spatial coordination could be achieved through trigger waves of Cdk1 activity(3). Using an extract system that performs cell cycles in vitro, here we show that mitosis does spread through Xenopus cytoplasm via trigger waves, propagating at a linear speed of approximately 60 mu m min(-1). Perturbing the feedback loops that give rise to the bistability of Cdk1 changes the speed and dynamics of the waves. Time-lapse imaging of intact eggs argues that trigger waves of Cdk1 activation are responsible for surface contraction waves, ripples in the cell cortex that precede cytokinesis(4,5). These findings indicate that Cdk1 trigger waves help ensure the spatiotemporal coordination of mitosis in large eggs. Trigger waves may be an important general mechanism for coordinating biochemical events over large distances.","[Chang, Jeremy B.; Ferrell, James E., Jr.] Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Dept Chem & Syst Biol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Ferrell, James E., Jr.] Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Dept Biochem, Stanford, CA 94305 USA","Chang, JB (reprint author), Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Dept Chem & Syst Biol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",jbchang@stanford.edu; james.ferrell@stanford.edu,,,"National Institutes of Health [GM046383, GM077544]; National Science Foundation","We thank H.

DNA synthesis by any one fork is thought to cease when it meets another travelling in the opposite direction, at which stage the replication machinery may simply dissociate before the nascent strands are finally ligated. But what actually happens is not clear. Here we present evidence consistent with the idea that every fork collision has the potential to threaten genomic integrity. In Escherichia coli this threat is kept at bay by RecG DNA translocase(3) and by single-strand DNA exonucleases. Without RecG, replication initiates where forks meet through a replisome assembly mechanism normally associated with fork repair, replication restart and recombination(4,5), establishing new forks with the potential to sustain cell growth and division without an active origin. This potential is realized when roadblocks to fork progression are reduced or eliminated. It relies on the chromosome being circular, reinforcing the idea that replication initiation is triggered repeatedly by fork collision. The results reported raise the question of whether replication fork collisions have pathogenic potential for organisms that exploit several origins to replicate each chromosome.","[Rudolph, Christian J.; Upton, Amy L.; Stockum, Anna; Nieduszynski, Conrad A.; Lloyd, Robert G.] Univ Nottingham, Queens Med Ctr, Ctr Genet & Genom, Nottingham NG7 2UH, England; [Rudolph, Christian J.; Upton, Amy L.] Brunel Univ, Div Biosci, Sch Hlth Sci & Social Care, London UB8 3PH, England","Rudolph, CJ (reprint author), Univ Nottingham, Queens Med Ctr, Ctr Genet & Genom, Nottingham NG7 2UH, England.",christian.rudolph@brunel.ac.uk,"Nieduszynski, Conrad/B-2170-2010","Nieduszynski, Conrad/0000-0003-2001-076X; Rudolph, Christian/0000-0003-2493-3748",MRC [G0800970]; Leverhulme Trust; BBSRC [BB/E023754/1],"We thank T.

The catalogue of somatic mutations from a cancer genome bears the signatures of the mutational processes that have been operative. Here we analysed 4,938,362 mutations from 7,042 cancers and extracted more than 20 distinct mutational signatures. Some are present in many cancer types, notably a signature attributed to the APOBEC family of cytidine deaminases, whereas others are confined to a single cancer class. Certain signatures are associated with age of the patient at cancer diagnosis, known mutagenic exposures or defects in DNA maintenance, but many are of cryptic origin. In addition to these genome-wide mutational signatures, hypermutation localized to small genomic regions, 'kataegis', is found in many cancer types. The results reveal the diversity of mutational processes underlying the development of cancer, with potential implications for understanding of cancer aetiology, prevention and therapy.","[Alexandrov, Ludmil B.; Nik-Zainal, Serena; Wedge, David C.; Behjati, Sam; Bignell, Graham R.; Bolli, Niccolo; Butler, Adam P.; Davies, Helen R.; Ilicic, Tomislav; Jones, David; Martin, Sancha; Papaemmanuil, Elli; Raine, Keiran; Ramakrishna, Manasa; Teague, Jon W.; Yates, Lucy R.; Futreal, P.

This stimulates the distal production of jasmonates, potent regulators of defence responses. Using non-invasive electrodes we mapped surface potential changes in Arabidopsis thaliana after wounding leaf eight and found that membrane depolarizations correlated with jasmonate signalling domains in undamaged leaves. Furthermore, current injection elicited jasmonoyl-isoleucine accumulation, resulting in a transcriptome enriched in RNAs encoding key jasmonate signalling regulators. From among 34 screened membrane protein mutant lines, mutations in several clade 3 GLUTAMATE RECEPTOR-LIKE genes (GLRs 3.2, 3.3 and 3.6) attenuated wound-induced surface potential changes. Jasmonate-response gene expression in leaves distal to wounds was reduced in a glr3.3 glr3.6 double mutant. This work provides a genetic basis for investigating mechanisms of long-distance wound signalling in plants and indicates that plant genes related to those important for synaptic activity in animals function in organ-to-organ wound signalling.","[Mousavi, Seyed A.

Asteroseismology measures gravity with an uncertainty of about 2 per cent but is restricted to relatively small samples of bright stars, most of which are giants(4-6). The availability of high-precision measurements of brightness variations for more than 150,000 stars(7,8) provides an opportunity to investigate whether the variations can be used to determine surface gravities. The Fourier power of granulation on a star's surface correlates physically with surface gravity(9,10): if brightness variations on timescales of hours arise from granulation(11), then such variations should correlate with surface gravity. Here we report an analysis of archival data that reveals an observational correlation between surface gravity and root mean squared brightness variations on timescales of less than eight hours for stars with temperatures of 4,500 to 6,750 kelvin, log surface gravities of 2.5 to 4.5 (cgs units) and overall brightness variations of less than three parts per thousand. A straightforward observation of optical brightness variations therefore allows a determination of the surface gravity with a precision of better than 25 per cent for inactive Sun-like stars at main-sequence to giant stages of evolution.","[Bastien, Fabienne A.; Stassun, Keivan G.; Pepper, Joshua] Vanderbilt Univ, Dept Phys & Astron, Nashville, TN 37235 USA; [Stassun, Keivan G.] Fisk Univ, Dept Phys, Nashville, TN 37208 USA; [Basri, Gibor] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Astron, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Pepper, Joshua] Lehigh Univ, Dept Phys, Bethlehem, PA 18015 USA","Bastien, FA (reprint author), Vanderbilt Univ, Dept Phys & Astron, 1807 Stn B, Nashville, TN 37235 USA.",fabienne.a.bastien@vanderbilt.edu,,,NASA; Vanderbilt Provost Graduate Fellowship; NSF PAARE [AST-0849736],"The research described in this paper makes use of Filtergraph (http://filtergraph.vanderbilt.edu), an online data visualization tool developed at Vanderbilt University through the Vanderbilt Initiative in Data-intensive Astrophysics.

The combination of change in unit cell shape, long range of elastic distortion and flow of latent heat leads to large energy barriers resulting in domain structure, hysteresis and cracking. The situation is worse near a triple point, where more than two phases are involved. The well-known metal-insulator transition in vanadium dioxide(1), a popular candidate for ultrafast optical and electrical switching applications, is a case in point. Even though VO2 is one of the simplest strongly correlated materials, experimental difficulties posed by the first-order nature of the metal-insulator transition as well as the involvement of at least two competing insulating phases have led to persistent controversy about its nature(1-4). Here we show that studying single-crystal VO2 nanobeams(5-16) in a purpose-built nanomechanical strain apparatus allows investigation of this prototypical phase transition with unprecedented control and precision. Our results include the striking finding that the triple point of the metallic phase and two insulating phases is at the transition temperature, T-tr = T-c, which we determine to be 65.0 +/- 0.1 degrees C. The findings have profound implications for the mechanism of the metal-insulator transition in VO2, but they also demonstrate the importance of this approach for mastering phase transitions in many other strongly correlated materials, such as manganites(17) and iron-based superconductors(18).","[Park, Jae Hyung; Coy, Jim M.; Kasirga, T.

In contrast, the photogenerated excitons in organic photovoltaic cells are dissociated at a single donor-acceptor heterojunction formed within a de-mixed blend of the donor and acceptor semiconductors(2). The nanoscale morphology and high charge densities give a high rate of electron-hole encounters, which should in principle result in the formation of spin-triplet excitons, as in organic light-emitting diodes(3). Although organic photovoltaic cells would have poor quantum efficiencies if every encounter led to recombination, state-of-the-art examples nevertheless demonstrate near-unity quantum efficiency(4). Here we show that this suppression of recombination arises through the interplay between spin, energetics and delocalization of electronic excitations in organic semiconductors. We use time-resolved spectroscopy to study a series of model high-efficiency polymer-fullerene systems in which the lowest-energy molecular triplet exciton (T-1) for the polymer is lower in energy than the intermolecular charge transfer state. We observe the formation of T-1 states following bimolecular recombination, indicating that encounters of spin-uncorrelated electrons and holes generate charge transfer states with both spin-singlet ((CT)-C-1) and spin-triplet ((CT)-C-3) characters. We show that the formation of triplet excitons can be the main loss mechanism in organic photovoltaic cells. But we also find that, even when energetically favoured, the relaxation of (CT)-C-3 states to T-1 states can be strongly suppressed by wavefunction delocalization, allowing for the dissociation of (CT)-C-3 states back to free charges, thereby reducing recombination and enhancing device performance. Our results point towards new design rules both for photo-conversion systems, enabling the suppression of electron-hole recombination, and for organic light-emitting diodes, avoiding the formation of triplet excitons and enhancing fluorescence efficiency.","[Rao, Akshay; Chow, Philip C.

Hypotheses for a Northern Hemisphere trigger, through oceanic redistributions of heat, are based in part on the abrupt onset of warming seen in East Antarctic ice cores and dated to 18,000 years ago, which is several thousand years after high-latitude Northern Hemisphere summer insolation intensity began increasing from its minimum, approximately 24,000 years ago(3,4). An alternative explanation is that local solar insolation changes cause the Southern Hemisphere to warm independently(2,5). Here we present results from a new, annually resolved ice-core record from West Antarctica that reconciles these two views. The records show that 18,000 years ago snow accumulation in West Antarctica began increasing, coincident with increasing carbon dioxide concentrations, warming in East Antarctica and cooling in the Northern Hemisphere(6) associated with an abrupt decrease in Atlantic meridional overturning circulation(7). However, significant warming in West Antarctica began at least 2,000 years earlier. Circum-Antarctic sea-ice decline, driven by increasing local insolation, is the likely cause of this warming. The marine-influenced West Antarctic records suggest a more active role for the Southern Ocean in the onset of deglaciation than is inferred from ice cores in the East Antarctic interior, which are largely isolated from sea-ice changes.","[Fudge, T.

This is seen, for example, when digits are lost from the limbs during evolution(1,3,4). Extant archosaurs (crocodiles and birds) show several instances of digit loss(3,5,6) under different selective regimes, and show limbs with one, two, three, four or the ancestral number of five digits. The 'lost' digits sometimes persist for millions of years as developmental vestiges(7-10). Here we examine digit loss in the Nile crocodile and five birds, using markers of three successive stages of digit development. In two independent lineages under different selection, wing digit I and all its markers disappear. In contrast, hindlimb digit V persists in all species sampled, both as cartilage, and as Sox9-expressing precartilage domains, 250 million years after the adult digit disappeared. There is therefore a mismatch between evolution of the embryonic and adult phenotypes. All limbs, regardless of digit number, showed similar expression of sonic hedgehog (Shh). Even in the one-fingered emu wing, expression of posterior genes Hoxd11 and Hoxd12 was conserved, whereas expression of anterior genes Gli3 and Alx4 was not. We suggest that the persistence of digit V in the embryo may reflect constraints, particularly the conserved posterior gene networks associated with the zone of polarizing activity (ZPA(11)). The more rapid and complete disappearance of digit I may reflect its ZPA-independent specification, and hence, weaker developmental constraints. Interacting with these constraints are selection pressures for limb functions such as flying and perching. This model may help to explain the diverse patterns of digit loss in tetrapods. Our study may also help to understand how selection on adults leads to changes in development.","[de Bakker, Merijn A. G.; Fowler, Donald A.; den Oude, Kelly; Dondorp, Esther M.; Navas, M.

They are important examples of cooperation shaped by evolution. Mutualism between animals and plants has a key role in the organization of ecological communities(1-3). Such networks in ecology have generally evolved a nested architecture(4,5) independent of species composition and latitude(6,7); specialist species, with only few mutualistic links, tend to interact with a proper subset of the many mutualistic partners of any of the generalist species(1). Despite sustained efforts(5,8-10) to explain observed network structure on the basis of community-level stability or persistence, such correlative studies have reached minimal consensus(11-13). Here we show that nested interaction networks could emerge as a consequence of an optimization principle aimed at maximizing the species abundance in mutualistic communities. Using analytical and numerical approaches, we show that because of the mutualistic interactions, an increase in abundance of a given species results in a corresponding increase in the total number of individuals in the community, and also an increase in the nestedness of the interaction matrix. Indeed, the species abundances and the nestedness of the interaction matrix are correlated by a factor that depends on the strength of the mutualistic interactions. Nestedness and the observed spontaneous emergence of generalist and specialist species occur for several dynamical implementations of the variational principle under stationary conditions. Optimized networks, although remaining stable, tend to be less resilient than their counterparts with randomly assigned interactions. In particular, we show analytically that the abundance of the rarest species is linked directly to the resilience of the community.

Neither male sex organs nor meiosis have ever been observed in these microscopic animals: oocytes are formed through mitotic divisions, with no reduction of chromosome number and no indication of chromosome pairing(2). However, current evidence does not exclude that they may engage in sex on rare, cryptic occasions. Here we report the genome of a bdelloid rotifer, Adineta vaga (Davis, 1873)(3), and show that its structure is incompatible with conventional meiosis. At gene scale, the genome of A. vaga is tetraploid and comprises both anciently duplicated segments and less divergent allelic regions. However, in contrast to sexual species, the allelic regions are rearranged and sometimes even found on the same chromosome. Such structure does not allow meiotic pairing; instead, we find abundant evidence of gene conversion, which may limit the accumulation of deleterious mutations in the absence of meiosis. Gene families involved in resistance to oxidation, carbohydrate metabolism and defence against transposons are significantly expanded, which may explain why transposable elements cover only 3% of the assembled sequence. Furthermore, 8% of the genes are likely to be of non-metazoan origin and were probably acquired horizontally. This apparent convergence between bdelloids and prokaryotes sheds new light on the evolutionary significance of sex.","[Flot, Jean-Francois; Hespeels, Boris; Li, Xiang; Lejeune, Benjamin; Van Doninck, Karine] Univ Namur, Dept Biol, URBE, Lab Evolutionary Genet & Ecol, B-5000 Namur, Belgium; [Flot, Jean-Francois; Hespeels, Boris; Li, Xiang; Lejeune, Benjamin; Van Doninck, Karine] Namur Res Inst Life Sci NARILIS, B-5000 Namur, Belgium; [Flot, Jean-Francois; Noel, Benjamin; Aury, Jean-Marc; Barbe, Valerie; Couloux, Arnaud; Da Silva, Corinne; Labadie, Karine; Poulain, Julie; Weissenbach, Jean; Wincker, Patrick; Jaillon, Olivier] Ctr Natl Sequencage, GENOSCOPE, CEA Inst Genom, F-91057 Evry, France; [Flot, Jean-Francois; Weissenbach, Jean; Wincker, Patrick; Jaillon, Olivier] Univ Evry, UMR8030, F-91057 Evry, France; [Flot, Jean-Francois; Weissenbach, Jean; Wincker, Patrick; Jaillon, Olivier] CNRS, UMR 8030, F-91057 Evry, France; [Flot, Jean-Francois; Hallatschek, Oskar] Max Planck Inst Dynam & Self Org, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany; [Arkhipova, Irina; Gladyshev, Eugene; Hecox-Lea, Bette; Rodriguez, Fernando; Yushenova, Irina; Welch, David B.

Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are associated with deficiencies in oxytocin levels(5) and with genetic alterations of the oxytocin receptor (OXTR)(6). Thirty years ago, Muhlethaler et al.(7) found that oxytocin increases the firing of inhibitory hippocampal neurons, but it remains unclear how elevated inhibition could account for the ability of oxytocin to improve information processing in the brain. Here we describe in mammalian hippocampus a simple yet powerful mechanism by which oxytocin enhances cortical information transfer while simultaneously lowering background activity, thus greatly improving the signal-to-noise ratio. Increased fast-spiking interneuron activity not only suppresses spontaneous pyramidal cell firing, but also enhances the fidelity of spike transmission and sharpens spike timing. Use-dependent depression at the fast-spiking interneuron-pyramidal cell synapse is both necessary and sufficient for the enhanced spike throughput. We show the generality of this novel circuit mechanism by activation of fast-spiking interneurons with cholecystokinin or channelrhodopsin-2. This provides insight into how a diffusely delivered neuromodulator can improve the performance of neural circuitry that requires synapse specificity and millisecond precision.","[Owen, Scott F.; Bader, Patrick L.; Tsien, Richard W.] Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Dept Mol & Cellular Physiol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Tuncdemir, Sebnem N.; Bader, Patrick L.; Tirko, Natasha N.; Fishell, Gord; Tsien, Richard W.] NYU, Inst Neurosci, New York, NY 10016 USA","Tsien, RW (reprint author), Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Dept Mol & Cellular Physiol, 279 Campus Dr, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",richard.tsien@nyumc.org,,,"Burnett Family Fund; Mosbacher Fund; Mathers Foundation; National Institute of Mental Health [MH064070, MH071739]; National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke [NS024067]; Simons Foundation [95395]; NDSEG fellowship; NIMH-NRSA fellowship [F31MH084430]; SNSF; SFGBM fellowship [PASMP3_140063/1]","We thank C.

C1P produced by ceramide kinase is an activator of group IVA cytosolic phospholipase A(2)alpha (cPLA(2)alpha), the rate-limiting releaser of arachidonic acid used for pro-inflammatory eicosanoid production(3,6-9), which contributes to disease pathogenesis in asthma or airway hyper-responsiveness, cancer, atherosclerosis and thrombosis. To modulate eicosanoid action and avoid the damaging effects of chronic inflammation, cells require efficient targeting, trafficking and presentation of C1P to specific cellular sites. Vesicular trafficking is likely(10) but non-vesicular mechanisms for C1P sensing, transfer and presentation remain unexplored(11,12). Moreover, the molecular basis for selective recognition and binding among signalling lipids with phosphate headgroups, namely C1P, phosphatidic acid or their lyso-derivatives, remains unclear. Here, a ubiquitously expressed lipid transfer protein, human GLTPD1, named here CPTP, is shown to specifically transfer C1P between membranes. Crystal structures establish C1P binding through a novel surface-localized, phosphate headgroup recognition centre connected to an interior hydrophobic pocket that adaptively expands to ensheath differing-length lipid chains using a cleft-like gating mechanism. The two-layer, alpha-helically-dominated 'sandwich' topology identifies CPTP as the prototype for a new glycolipid transfer protein fold(13) subfamily. CPTP resides in the cell cytosol but associates with the trans-Golgi network, nucleus and plasma membrane. RNA interference-induced CPTP depletion elevates C1P steady-state levels and alters Golgi cisternae stack morphology. The resulting C1P decrease in plasma membranes and increase in the Golgi complex stimulates cPLA(2)alpha release of arachidonic acid, triggering pro-inflammatory eicosanoid generation.","[Simanshu, Dhirendra K.; Patel, Dinshaw J.] Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Struct Biol Program, New York, NY 10065 USA; [Kamlekar, Ravi Kanth; Zou, Xianqiong; Zhai, Xiuhong; Mishra, Shrawan K.; Hinchcliffe, Edward H.; Brown, Rhoderick E.] Univ Minnesota, Hormel Inst, Austin, MN 55912 USA; [Wijesinghe, Dayanjan S.; Chalfant, Charles E.] Virginia Commonwealth Univ, Dept Biochem & Mol Biol, Richmond, VA 23298 USA; [Molotkovsky, Julian G.] Russian Acad Sci, Shemyakin Ovchinnikov Inst Bioorgan Chem, Moscow, Russia; [Malinina, Lucy] CIC BioGUNE, Struct Biol Unit, Derio Bilbao 48160, Spain; [Chalfant, Charles E.] Hunter Holmes McGuire Vet Adm Med Ctr, Richmond, VA 23249 USA; [Chalfant, Charles E.] Virginia Commonwealth Univ, Med Coll Virginia, Massey Canc Ctr, Richmond, VA 23298 USA","Brown, RE (reprint author), Univ Minnesota, Hormel Inst, 801 16th Ave NE, Austin, MN 55912 USA.",ehinchcliffe@hi.umn.edu; cechalfant@vcu.edu; reb@umn.edu; pateld@mskcc.org,"Malinina, Lucy/B-8161-2013","Simanshu, Dhirendra/0000-0002-9717-4618; Brown, Rhoderick/0000-0002-7337-3604","NIH/NCI [CA121493]; NIH/NIGMS [GM45928, GM072754]; VA Merit Award; VA Research Career Scientist Award; VA Career Devel.

Although primarily cytoprotective, autophagy can also contribute to cell death; it is thus important to understand what distinguishes the life or death decision in autophagic cells(3). Here we report that induction of autophagy is coupled to reduction of histone H4 lysine 16 acetylation (H4K16ac) through downregulation of the histone acetyltransferase hMOF (also called KAT8 or MYST1), and demonstrate that this histone modification regulates the outcome of autophagy. At a genome-wide level, we find that H4K16 deacetylation is associated predominantly with the downregulation of autophagy-related genes. Antagonizing H4K16ac downregulation upon autophagy induction results in the promotion of cell death. Our findings establish that alteration in a specific histone post-translational modification during autophagy affects the transcriptional regulation of autophagy-related genes and initiates a regulatory feedback loop, which serves as a key determinant of survival versus death responses upon autophagy induction.","[Fullgrabe, Jens; Struijk, Robert B.; Joseph, Bertrand] Karolinska Inst, Dept Oncol Pathol, Canc Ctr Karolinska, S-17176 Stockholm, Sweden; [Lynch-Day, Melinda A.; Klionsky, Daniel J.] Univ Michigan, Inst Life Sci, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Lynch-Day, Melinda A.; Klionsky, Daniel J.] Univ Michigan, Dept Mol Cellular & Dev Biol, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Lynch-Day, Melinda A.; Klionsky, Daniel J.] Univ Michigan, Dept Biol Chem, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Heldring, Nina; Hermanson, Ola] Karolinska Inst, Dept Neurosci, S-17177 Stockholm, Sweden; [Li, Wenbo; Ma, Qi; Rosenfeld, Michael G.] Univ Calif San Diego, Sch Med, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Dept Med, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Ma, Qi] Univ Calif San Diego, Grad Program Bioinformat & Syst Biol, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA","Joseph, B (reprint author), Karolinska Inst, Dept Oncol Pathol, Canc Ctr Karolinska, S-17176 Stockholm, Sweden.",bertrand.joseph@ki.se,"Ma, Qi/C-9716-2015","Hermanson, Ola/0000-0001-9320-7921",Karolinska Institutet Foundations; Rackham Predoctoral Fellowship; US Department of Defense [BC110381]; National Institutes of Health [GM53396]; National Institutes of Health/National Cancer Institute; Department of Defense; Swedish Cancer Society; Swedish Childhood Cancer Foundation; Swedish Research Council,"We thank G.

Dissection of causal gene functions in cellular and organismal processes therefore necessitates approaches that enable spatially and temporally precise modulation of gene expression. Recently, a variety of microbial and plant-derived light-sensitive proteins have been engineered as optogenetic actuators, enabling high-precision spatiotemporal control of many cellular functions(1-11). However, versatile and robust technologies that enable optical modulation of transcription in the mammalian endogenous genome remain elusive. Here we describe the development of light-inducible transcriptional effectors (LITEs), an optogenetic two-hybrid system integrating the customizable TALE DNA-binding domain(12-14) with the light-sensitive cryptochrome 2 protein and its interacting partner CIB1 from Arabidopsis thaliana. LITEs do not require additional exogenous chemical cofactors, are easily customized to target many endogenous genomic loci, and can be activated within minutes with reversibility(6,15). LITEs can be packaged into viral vectors and genetically targeted to probe specific cell populations. We have applied this system in primary mouse neurons, as well as in the brain of freely behaving mice in vivo to mediate reversible modulation of mammalian endogenous gene expression as well as targeted epigenetic chromatin modifications. The LITE system establishes a novel mode of optogenetic control of endogenous cellular processes and enables direct testing of the causal roles of genetic and epigenetic regulation in normal biological processes and disease states.","[Konermann, Silvana; Brigham, Mark D.; Trevino, Alexandro E.; Hsu, Patrick D.; Heidenreich, Matthias; Cong, Le; Platt, Randall J.; Scott, David A.; Church, George M.; Zhang, Feng] Broad Inst MIT & Harvard, Cambridge Ctr 7, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; [Konermann, Silvana; Brigham, Mark D.; Trevino, Alexandro E.; Hsu, Patrick D.; Heidenreich, Matthias; Cong, Le; Platt, Randall J.; Scott, David A.; Zhang, Feng] MIT, Dept Biol Engn, Dept Brain & Cognit Sci, McGovern Inst Brain Res, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Brigham, Mark D.] Harvard Univ, Sch Engn & Appl Sci, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Hsu, Patrick D.] Harvard Univ, Dept Mol & Cellular Biol, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Cong, Le] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Program Biol & Biomed Sci, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Church, George M.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Genet, Boston, MA 02115 USA","Zhang, F (reprint author), Broad Inst MIT & Harvard, Cambridge Ctr 7, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA.",zhang@broadinstitute.org,"Cong, Le/M-9981-2013","Cong, Le/0000-0003-4725-8714; church, george/0000-0001-6232-9969","McGovern Institute for Brain Research at MIT; Human Frontiers Science Program; NIH NHGRI CEGS [P50-HG005550]; NIH [R01-NS073124, DP1-MH100706]; Keck Foundation; McKnight Foundation; Vallee Foundation; Damon Runyon Foundation; Searle Scholars Foundation; Klingenstein Foundation; Simons Foundation","We thank C.

Most cell types, except germ cells and pre-implantation embryos(3-5), display relatively stable DNA methylation patterns, with 70-80% of all CpGs being methylated(6). Despite recent advances, we still have a limited understanding of when, where and how many CpGs participate in genomic regulation. Here we report the in-depth analysis of 42 whole-genome bisulphite sequencing data sets across 30 diverse human cell and tissue types. We observe dynamic regulation for only 21.8% of autosomal CpGs within a normal developmental context, most of which are distal to transcription start sites. These dynamic CpGs co-localize with gene regulatory elements, particularly enhancers and transcription-factor-binding sites, which allow identification of key lineage-specific regulators. In addition, differentially methylated regions (DMRs) often contain single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with cell-type-related diseases as determined by genome-wide association studies. The results also highlight the general inefficiency of whole-genome bisulphite sequencing, as 70-80% of the sequencing reads across these data sets provided little or no relevant information about CpG methylation. To demonstrate further the utility of our DMR set, we use it to classify unknown samples and identify representative signature regions that recapitulate major DNA methylation dynamics. In summary, although in theory every CpG can change its methylation state, our results suggest that only a fraction does so as part of coordinated regulatory programs. Therefore, our selected DMRs can serve as a starting point to guide new, more effective reduced representation approaches to capture the most informative fraction of CpGs, as well as further pinpoint putative regulatory elements.","[Ziller, Michael J.; Gu, Hongcang; Donaghey, Julie; De Jager, Philip L.; Rosen, Evan D.; Bernstein, Bradley E.; Gnirke, Andreas; Meissner, Alexander] Broad Inst MIT & Harvard, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; [Ziller, Michael J.; Donaghey, Julie; Meissner, Alexander] Harvard Stem Cell Inst, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Ziller, Michael J.; Mueller, Fabian; Donaghey, Julie; Meissner, Alexander] Harvard Univ, Dept Stem Cell & Regenerat Biol, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Tsai, Linus T. -Y.; Rosen, Evan D.] Beth Israel Deaconess Med Ctr, Div Endocrinol, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Kohlbacher, Oliver] Univ Tubingen, Ctr Bioinformat, D-72074 Tubingen, Germany; [Kohlbacher, Oliver] Univ Tubingen, Quantitat Biol Ctr, D-72074 Tubingen, Germany; [De Jager, Philip L.] Brigham & Womens Hosp, Inst Neurosci, Program Translat NeuroPsychiat Genom, Dept Neurol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [De Jager, Philip L.] Brigham & Womens Hosp, Inst Neurosci, Program Translat NeuroPsychiat Genom, Dept Psychiat, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Bennett, David A.] Rush Univ, Med Ctr, Rush Alzheimers Dis Ctr, Chicago, IL 60612 USA; [Bernstein, Bradley E.] Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Dept Pathol, Boston, MA 02114 USA","Meissner, A (reprint author), Broad Inst MIT & Harvard, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA.",alexander_meissner@harvard.edu,"Kohlbacher, Oliver/B-7310-2008; Waha, Andreas/J-2950-2014","Kohlbacher, Oliver/0000-0003-1739-4598; Tsai, Linus/0000-0002-0134-6949","National Institutes of Health (NIH) Roadmap Epigenomics Project [ES017690]; NIH [P30AG10161, R01AG17917, R01AG15819, R01AG36042, U01ES017155, P01GM099117]; Pew Charitable Trusts; New York Stem Cell Foundation","We would like to thank K.

The application of these techniques to the RecBCD helicase of Escherichia coli has resolved some long-standing discrepancies, and has provided otherwise unattainable mechanistic insights into its enzymatic behaviour(4-6). Enigmatically, the DNA unwinding rates of individual enzyme molecules are seen to vary considerably(6-8), but the origin of this heterogeneity remains unknown. Here we investigate the physical basis for this behaviour. Although any individual RecBCD molecule unwound DNA at a constant rate for an average of approximately 30,000 steps, we discover that transiently halting a single enzyme-DNA complex by depleting Mg2+-ATP could change the subsequent rates of DNA unwinding by that enzyme after reintroduction to ligand. The proportion of molecules that changed rate increased exponentially with the duration of the interruption, with a half-life of approximately 1 second, suggesting that a conformational change occurred during the time that the molecule was arrested. The velocity after pausing an individual molecule was any velocity found in the starting distribution of the ensemble. We suggest that substrate binding stabilizes the enzyme in one of many equilibrium conformational sub-states that determine the rate-limiting translocation behaviour of each RecBCD molecule. Each stabilized sub-state can persist for the duration (approximately 1 minute) of processive unwinding of a DNA molecule, comprising tens of thousands of catalytic steps, each of which is much faster than the time needed for the conformational change required to alter kinetic behaviour. This ligand-dependent stabilization of rate-defining conformational sub-states results in seemingly static molecule-to-molecule variation in RecBCD helicase activity, but in fact reflects one microstate from the equilibrium ensemble that a single molecule manifests during an individual processive translocation event.","[Liu, Bian; Kowalczykowski, Stephen C.] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Microbiol & Mol Genet, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Liu, Bian; Baskin, Ronald J.; Kowalczykowski, Stephen C.] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Mol & Cellular Biol, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Liu, Bian; Kowalczykowski, Stephen C.] Univ Calif Davis, Biophys Grad Grp, Davis, CA 95616 USA","Kowalczykowski, SC (reprint author), Univ Calif Davis, Dept Microbiol & Mol Genet, Davis, CA 95616 USA.",sckowalczykowski@ucdavis.edu,"Liu, Bian/C-4865-2011","Liu, Bian/0000-0001-8806-820X","National Institutes of Health [GM-62653, GM-64745]",We are grateful to members of the laboratory for their comments on this work.

Although expressed at very low levels in most tissues, folate receptors, especially FR alpha, are expressed at high levels in numerous cancers to meet the folate demand of rapidly dividing cells under low folate conditions(1-3). The folate dependency of many tumours has been therapeutically and diagnostically exploited by administration of anti-FR alpha antibodies, high-affinity antifolates(4,5), folate-based imaging agents and folate-conjugated drugs and toxins(6-8). To understand how folate binds its receptors, we determined the crystal structure of human FR alpha in complex with folic acid at 2.8 angstrom resolution. FR alpha has a globular structure stabilized by eight disulphide bonds and contains a deep open folate-binding pocket comprised of residues that are conserved in all receptor subtypes. The folate pteroate moiety is buried inside the receptor, whereas its glutamate moiety is solvent-exposed and sticks out of the pocket entrance, allowing it to be conjugated to drugs without adversely affecting FR alpha binding. The extensive interactions between the receptor and ligand readily explain the high folate-binding affinity of folate receptors and provide a template for designing more specific drugs targeting the folate receptor system.","[Chen, Chen; Ke, Jiyuan; Zhou, X.

We tested the concept that gene imbalance across an extra chromosome can be de facto corrected by manipulating a single gene, XIST (the X-inactivation gene). Using genome editing with zinc finger nucleases, we inserted a large, inducible XIST transgene into the DYRK1A locus on chromosome 21, in Down's syndrome pluripotent stem cells. The XIST non-coding RNA coats chromosome 21 and triggers stable heterochromatin modifications, chromosome-wide transcriptional silencing and DNA methylation to form a 'chromosome 21 Barr body'. This provides a model to study human chromosome inactivation and creates a system to investigate genomic expression changes and cellular pathologies of trisomy 21, free from genetic and epigenetic noise. Notably, deficits in proliferation and neural rosette formation are rapidly reversed upon silencing one chromosome 21. Successful trisomy silencing in vitro also surmounts the major first step towards potential development of 'chromosome therapy'.","[Jiang, Jun; Jing, Yuanchun; Chiang, Jen-Chieh; Kolpa, Heather J.; Carone, Dawn M.; Carone, Benjamin R.; Byron, Meg; Hall, Lisa L.; Lawrence, Jeanne B.] Univ Massachusetts, Sch Med, Dept Cell & Dev Biol, Worcester, MA 01655 USA; [Cost, Gregory J.; Shivak, David A.; Guschin, Dmitry Y.; Pearl, Jocelynn R.; Rebar, Edward J.; Gregory, Philip D.; Urnov, Fyodor D.] Sangamo BioSci, Richmond, CA 94804 USA; [Cotton, Allison M.; Brown, Carolyn J.] Univ British Columbia, Dept Med Genet, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z3, Canada","Lawrence, JB (reprint author), Univ Massachusetts, Sch Med, Dept Cell & Dev Biol, 55 Lake Ave North, Worcester, MA 01655 USA.",furnov@sangamo.com; Jeanne.Lawrence@umassmed.edu,"Brown, Carolyn/A-5159-2014","Brown, Carolyn/0000-0002-8959-0101; Cost, Gregory/0000-0002-8509-4653","CIHR [MOP-13680]; NIH [1F32CA154086, 2T32HD007439];  [GM053234];  [GM085548];  [GM096400 RC4]","We appreciate recent initiatives by administrators of NIGMS and NIH to support more high-risk, high-impact research.

The expression of carbon catabolic genes increased linearly with decreasing growth rates upon limitation of carbon influx, but decreased linearly with decreasing growth rate upon limitation of nitrogen or sulphur influx. In contrast, the expression of biosynthetic genes showed the opposite linear growth-rate dependence as the catabolic genes. A coarse-grained mathematical model provides a quantitative framework for understanding and predicting gene expression responses to catabolic and anabolic limitations. A scheme of integral feedback control featuring the inhibition of cAMP signalling by metabolic precursors is proposed and validated. These results reveal a key physiological role of cAMP-dependent catabolite repression: to ensure that proteomic resources are spent on distinct metabolic sectors as needed in different nutrient environments. Our findings underscore the power of quantitative physiology in unravelling the underlying functions of complex molecular signalling networks.","[You, Conghui; Okano, Hiroyuki; Hui, Sheng; Kim, Minsu; Hwa, Terence] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Phys, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [You, Conghui; Okano, Hiroyuki; Zhang, Zhongge; Gunderson, Carl W.; Hwa, Terence] Univ Calif San Diego, Div Biol Sci, Sect Mol Biol, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Hui, Sheng; Hwa, Terence] Univ Calif San Diego, Ctr Theoret Biol Phys, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Wang, Yi-Ping] Peking Univ, Coll Life Sci, State Key Lab Prot & Plant Gene Res, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China; [Lenz, Peter] Univ Marburg, Dept Phys, D-35032 Marburg, Germany; [Lenz, Peter] Univ Marburg, Ctr Synthet Microbiol, D-35032 Marburg, Germany; [Yan, Dalai] Indiana Univ Sch Med, Dept Microbiol & Immunol, Indianapolis, IN 46202 USA","Hwa, T (reprint author), Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Phys, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.",hwa@ucsd.edu,"Lenz, Peter/L-5980-2013; Hwa, Terence/J-4012-2013","Hwa, Terence/0000-0003-1837-6842; Hui, Sheng/0000-0002-4226-6806",Human Frontiers in Science Program [RGP0022]; NSF [PHY1058793]; NSF through the Center for Theoretical Biological Physics [PHY0822283],"We are grateful to R.

This behaviour can be understood in the magnetar model(3-5), according to which these sources are mainly powered by their own magnetic energy. This is supported by the fact that the magnetic fields inferred from several observed properties(6-8) of SGRs and AXPs are greater than-or at the high end of the range of-those of radio pulsars. In the peculiar case of SGR 0418+5729, a weak dipole magnetic moment is derived from its timing parameters(9), whereas a strong field has been proposed to reside in the stellar interior(10,11) and in multipole components on the surface(12). Here we show that the X-ray spectrum of SGR 0418+5729 has an absorption line, the properties of which depend strongly on the star's rotational phase. This line is interpreted as a proton cyclotron feature and its energy implies a magnetic field ranging from 2x10(14) gauss to more than 10(15) gauss.","[Tiengo, Andrea; Bignami, Giovanni F.] Ist Univ Super, I-27100 Pavia, Italy; [Tiengo, Andrea; Esposito, Paolo; Mereghetti, Sandro; Gastaldello, Fabio; Bignami, Giovanni F.] Ist Astrofis Spaziale & Fis Cosm Milano, INAF, I-20133 Milan, Italy; [Tiengo, Andrea] Ist Nazl Fis Nucl, Sez Pavia, I-27100 Pavia, Italy; [Turolla, Roberto; Nobili, Luciano] Univ Padua, Dipartimento Fis & Astron, I-35131 Padua, Italy; [Turolla, Roberto; Zane, Silvia] Univ Coll London, Mullard Space Sci Lab, Dorking RH5 6NT, Surrey, England; [Goetz, Diego] AIM CEA Irfu Serv Astrophys, F-91191 Gif Sur Yvette, France; [Israel, Gian Luca; Stella, Luigi] Osserv Astron Roma, INAF, I-00040 Monte Porzio Catone, Italy; [Rea, Nanda] Inst Ciencies Espai IEEC CSIC, E-08193 Barcelona, Spain","Tiengo, A (reprint author), Ist Univ Super, Piazza Vittoria 15, I-27100 Pavia, Italy.",andrea.tiengo@iusspavia.it,"Rea, Nanda/I-2853-2015; Gastaldello, Fabio/N-4226-2015","Rea, Nanda/0000-0003-2177-6388; Gastaldello, Fabio/0000-0002-9112-0184; Bignami, Giovanni/0000-0001-9582-2450; Tiengo, Andrea/0000-0002-6038-1090; Israel, GianLuca/0000-0001-5480-6438; MEREGHETTI, SANDRO/0000-0003-3259-7801; Esposito, Paolo/0000-0003-4849-5092",INAF through a PRIN; ASI [I/032/10/0],We thank G.

It is the essence of many sophisticated protocols for quantum communication and computation(2-5). Photons are an optimal choice for carrying information in the form of 'flying qubits', but the teleportation of photonic quantum bits(6-11) (qubits) has been limited by experimental inefficiencies and restrictions. Main disadvantages include the fundamentally probabilistic nature of linear-optics Bell measurements(12), as well as the need either to destroy the teleported qubit or attenuate the input qubit when the detectors do not resolve photon numbers(13). Here we experimentally realize fully deterministic quantum teleportation of photonic qubits without post-selection. The key step is to make use of a hybrid technique involving continuous-variable teleportation(14-16) of a discrete-variable, photonic qubit. When the receiver's feedforward gain is optimally tuned, the continuous-variable teleporter acts as a pure loss channel(17,18), and the input dual-rail-encoded qubit, based on a single photon, represents a quantum error detection code against photon loss(19) and hence remains completely intact for most teleportation events. This allows for a faithful qubit transfer even with imperfect continuous-variable entangled states: for four qubits the overall transfer fidelities range from 0.79 to 0.82 and all of them exceed the classical limit of teleportation. Furthermore, even for a relatively low level of the entanglement, qubits are teleported much more efficiently than in previous experiments, albeit post-selectively (taking into account only the qubit subspaces), and with a fidelity comparable to the previously reported values.","[Takeda, Shuntaro; Mizuta, Takahiro; Fuwa, Maria; Furusawa, Akira] Univ Tokyo, Sch Engn, Dept Appl Phys, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo 1138656, Japan; [van Loock, Peter] Johannes Gutenberg Univ Mainz, Inst Phys, D-55128 Mainz, Germany","Furusawa, A (reprint author), Univ Tokyo, Sch Engn, Dept Appl Phys, Bunkyo Ku, 7-3-1 Hongo, Tokyo 1138656, Japan.",akiraf@ap.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp,"Furusawa, Akira/P-5787-2014; Takeda, Shuntaro/A-3318-2015",,PDIS; GIA; G-COE; APSA; FIRST; SCOPE programme; ASCR-JSPS; ALPS,"This work was partly supported by PDIS, GIA, G-COE, APSA and FIRST, commissioned by MEXT (Japan); by the SCOPE programme commissioned by MIC (Japan); and by ASCR-JSPS.

At the current state of the art, quantum bits (qubits) are fabricated, initialized, controlled, read out and coupled to each other in simple circuits. This enables the realization of basic logic gates(4), the creation of complex entangled states(5,6) and the demonstration of algorithms(7) or error correction(8). Using different variants of low-noise parametric amplifiers(9), dispersive quantum non-demolition single-shot readout of single-qubit states with high fidelity has enabled continuous(10) and discrete(11) feedback control of single qubits. Here we realize full deterministic quantum teleportation with feed-forward in a chip-based superconducting circuit architecture(12-14). We use a set of two parametric amplifiers for both joint two-qubit and individual qubit single-shot readout, combined with flexible real-time digital electronics. Our device uses a crossed quantum bus technology that allows us to create complex networks with arbitrary connecting topology in a planar architecture. The deterministic teleportation process succeeds with order unit probability for any input state, as we prepare maximally entangled two-qubit states as a resource and distinguish all Bell states in a single two-qubit measurement with high efficiency and high fidelity. We teleport quantum states between two macroscopic systems separated by 6 mm at a rate of 10(4) s(-1), exceeding other reported implementations. The low transmission loss of superconducting waveguides is likely to enable the range of this and other schemes to be extended to significantly larger distances, enabling tests of non-locality and the realization of elements for quantum communication at microwave frequencies. The demonstrated feed-forward may also find application in error correction schemes.","[Steffen, L.; Salathe, Y.; Oppliger, M.; Kurpiers, P.; Baur, M.; Lang, C.; Eichler, C.; Puebla-Hellmann, G.; Fedorov, A.; Wallraff, A.] ETH, Dept Phys, CH-8093 Zurich, Switzerland","Steffen, L (reprint author), ETH, Dept Phys, CH-8093 Zurich, Switzerland.",lsteffen@phys.ethz.ch; andreas.wallraff@phys.ethz.ch,"Fedorov, Arkady/F-4764-2012; Wallraff, Andreas/C-2130-2009","Wallraff, Andreas/0000-0002-3476-4485",Eidgenossische Technische Hochschule Zurich (ETH Zurich); EU Integrated Project SOLID; EU Integrated Project SCALEQIT; Swiss National Science Foundation's National Centre of Competence in Research 'Quantum Science Technology',"We thank A.

The bonding arrangement within these glasses largely determines their properties, yet it remains a challenge to manipulate their structures in a controlled manner. Recently, we developed synthetic protocols for incorporating nanocrystals that are covalently bonded into amorphous materials(8,9). This 'nanocrystal-in-glass' approach not only combines two functional components in one material, but also the covalent link enables us to manipulate the glass structure to change its properties. Here we illustrate the power of this approach by introducing tin-doped indium oxide nanocrystals into niobium oxide glass (NbOx), and realize a new amorphous structure as a consequence of linking it to the nanocrystals. The resulting material demonstrates a previously unrealized optical switching behaviour that will enable the dynamic control of solar radiation transmittance through windows. These transparent films can block near-infrared and visible light selectively and independently by varying the applied electrochemical voltage over a range of 2.5 volts. We also show that the reconstructed NbOx glass has superior properties-its optical contrast is enhanced fivefold and it has excellent electrochemical stability, with 96 per cent of charge capacity retained after 2,000 cycles.","[Llordes, Anna; Garcia, Guillermo; Milliron, Delia J.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mol Foundry, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Gazquez, Jaume] ICMAB CSIC, Inst Ciencia Mat Barcelona, Bellaterra 08193, Catalonia, Spain","Milliron, DJ (reprint author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mol Foundry, 1 Cyclotron Rd, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",dmilliron@lbl.gov,"Milliron, Delia/D-6002-2012; Gazquez, Jaume/C-5334-2012; Llordes, Anna/H-2370-2015; Foundry, Molecular/G-9968-2014","Gazquez, Jaume/0000-0002-2561-328X; Llordes, Anna/0000-0003-4169-9156; ","Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, of the US Department of Energy (DOE) [DE-AC02-05CH11231]; DOE Early Career Research Program; Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas, CSIC, JAE; DOE-BES, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division; ORNL's Shared Research Equipment (ShaRE) User Program; DOE-BES","We thank S.

This interest is motivated by an understanding that increased variability and resulting extreme weather conditions may be more difficult for society to adapt to than altered mean conditions(3). So far, however, in spite of suggestions of increased variability(2), there is considerable uncertainty as to whether it is occurring(7). Here we show that although fluctuations in annual temperature have indeed shown substantial geographical variation over the past few decades(2), the time-evolving standard deviation of globally averaged temperature anomalies has been stable. A feature of the changes has been a tendency for many regions of low variability to experience increases, which might contribute to the perception of increased climate volatility. The normalization of temperature anomalies(2) creates the impression of larger relative overall increases, but our use of absolute values, which we argue is a more appropriate approach, reveals little change. Regionally, greater year-to-year changes recently occurred in much of North America and Europe. Many climate models predict that total variability will ultimately decrease under high greenhouse gas concentrations, possibly associated with reductions in sea-ice cover. Our findings contradict the view that a warming world will automatically be one of more overall climatic variation.","[Huntingford, Chris] Ctr Ecol & Hydrol, Wallingford OX10 8BB, Oxon, England; [Jones, Philip D.] Univ E Anglia, Fac Sci, Sch Environm Sci, Climat Res Unit, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England; [Jones, Philip D.] King Abdulaziz Univ, Dept Meteorol, Ctr Excellence Climate Change Res, Jeddah 21589, Saudi Arabia; [Livina, Valerie N.] Univ E Anglia, Fac Sci, Sch Environm Sci, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England; [Livina, Valerie N.] Natl Phys Lab, Teddington TW11 0LW, Middx, England; [Lenton, Timothy M.] Univ Exeter, Coll Life & Environm Sci, Exeter EX4 4PS, Devon, England; [Cox, Peter M.] Univ Exeter, Coll Engn Math & Phys Sci, Exeter EX4 4QF, Devon, England","Huntingford, C (reprint author), Ctr Ecol & Hydrol, Wallingford OX10 8BB, Oxon, England.",chg@ceh.ac.uk,"Jones, Philip/C-8718-2009; Cox, Peter/B-3299-2012; Huntingford, Chris/A-4307-2008","Jones, Philip/0000-0001-5032-5493; Huntingford, Chris/0000-0002-5941-7770",US DOE [DE-SC0005689]; NERC [NE/F005474/1],We gratefully acknowledge the Newton Institute for Mathematical Sciences programme Mathematical and Statistical Approaches to Climate Modelling and Prediction.

The oil palm sequence enables the discovery of genes for important traits as well as somaclonal epigenetic alterations that restrict the use of clones in commercial plantings(3), and should therefore help to achieve sustainability for biofuels and edible oils, reducing the rainforest footprint of this tropical plantation crop.","[Singh, Rajinder; Ong-Abdullah, Meilina; Low, Eng-Ti Leslie; Manaf, Mohamad Arif Abdul; Rosli, Rozana; Nookiah, Rajanaidu; Ooi, Leslie Cheng-Li; Ooi, Siew-Eng; Chan, Kuang-Lim; Halim, Mohd Amin; Azizi, Norazah; Nagappan, Jayanthi; Sambanthamurthi, Ravigadevi] Persiaran Inst, Malaysian Palm Oil Board, Kajang 43000, Selangor, Malaysia; [Bacher, Blaire; Lakey, Nathan; Smith, Steven W.; He, Dong; Hogan, Michael; Budiman, Muhammad A.; Ordway, Jared M.] Orion Genom, St Louis, MO 63108 USA; [Lee, Ernest K.; DeSalle, Rob] Amer Museum Nat Hist, Sackler Inst Comparat Genom, New York, NY 10024 USA; [Kudrna, David; Goicoechea, Jose Luis; Wing, Rod A.] Univ Arizona, Arizona Genom Inst, Tucson, AZ 85705 USA; [Wilson, Richard K.; Fulton, Robert S.] Washington Univ, Sch Med, Genome Inst, St Louis, MO 63108 USA; [Martienssen, Robert A.] Cold Spring Harbor Lab, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Gordon & Betty Moore Fdn, Cold Spring Harbor, NY 11724 USA","Martienssen, RA (reprint author), Cold Spring Harbor Lab, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Gordon & Betty Moore Fdn, Cold Spring Harbor, NY 11724 USA.",martiens@cshl.edu; raviga@mpob.gov.my,"Singh, Rajinder/P-9179-2015","Singh, Rajinder/0000-0001-9933-4884; Azizi, Norazah/0000-0001-5023-9763; Lee, Ernest/0000-0002-0974-7763; Wing, Rod/0000-0001-6633-6226; Chan, Kuang-Lim/0000-0002-8419-0432",Malaysian Palm Oil Board; NSF [0421604],"We acknowledge the contributions of N.

Modern E. guineensis has three fruit forms, dura (thick-shelled), pisifera (shell-less) and tenera (thin-shelled), a hybrid between dura and pisifera(1-4). The pisifera palm is usually female-sterile. The tenera palm yields far more oil than dura, and is the basis for commercial palm oil production in all of southeast Asia(5). Here we describe the mapping and identification of the SHELL gene responsible for the different fruit forms. Using homozygosity mapping by sequencing, we found two independent mutations in the DNA-binding domain of a homologue of the MADS-box gene SEEDSTICK (STK, also known as AGAMOUS-LIKE 11), which controls ovule identity and seed development in Arabidopsis. The SHELL gene is responsible for the tenera phenotype in both cultivated and wild palms from sub-Saharan Africa, and our findings provide a genetic explanation for the single gene hybrid vigour (or heterosis) attributed to SHELL, via heterodimerization.

Imprinted genes were recently shown to be expressed in mammalian adult stem cells to support self-renewal of neural and lung stem cells(2-4); however, a role for imprinting per se in adult stem cells remains elusive. Here we show upregulation of growth-restricting imprinted genes, including in the H19-Igf2 locus(5), in long-term haematopoietic stem cells and their downregulation upon haematopoietic stem cell activation and proliferation. A differentially methylated region upstream of H19 (H19-DMR), serving as the imprinting control region, determines the reciprocal expression of H19 from the maternal allele and Igf2 from the paternal allele(1). In addition, H19 serves as a source of miR-675, which restricts Igf1r expression(6). We demonstrate that conditional deletion of the maternal but not the paternal H19-DMR reduces adult haematopoietic stem cell quiescence, a state required for long-term maintenance of haematopoietic stem cells, and compromises haematopoietic stem cell function. Maternal-specific H19-DMR deletion results in activation of the Igf2-Igfr1 pathway, as shown by the translocation of phosphorylated FoxO3 (an inactive form) from nucleus to cytoplasm and the release of FoxO3-mediated cell cycle arrest, thus leading to increased activation, proliferation and eventual exhaustion of haematopoietic stem cells. Mechanistically, maternal-specific H19-DMR deletion leads to Igf2 upregulation and increased translation of Igf1r, which is normally suppressed by H19-derived miR-675. Similarly, genetic inactivation of Igf1r partly rescues the H19-DMR deletion phenotype. Our work establishes a new role for this unique form of epigenetic control at the H19-Igf2 locus in maintaining adult stem cells.","[Venkatraman, Aparna; He, Xi C.; Sugimura, Ryohichi; Perry, John M.; Tao, Fang; Zhao, Meng; Christenson, Matthew K.; Sanchez, Rebeca; Yu, Jaclyn Y.; Haug, Jeffrey S.; Paulson, Ariel; Li, Hua; Li, Linheng] Stowers Inst Med Res, Kansas City, MO 64110 USA; [Venkatraman, Aparna] Christian Med Coll & Hosp, Ctr Stem Cell Res, Vellore 632002, Tamil Nadu, India; [Thorvaldsen, Joanne L.; Bartolomei, Marisa S.] Univ Penn, Dept Cell & Dev Biol, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Sanchez, Rebeca] Inst Recerca Vall Dhebron, Cell Therapy & Genet Lab, Barcelona 08035, Spain; [Peng, Lai; Zhong, Xiao-bo] Univ Kansas, Med Ctr, Dept Pharmacol Toxicol & Therapeut, Kansas City, KS 66160 USA; [Clemens, Thomas L.] Johns Hopkins Med, Ctr Musculoskeletal Res, Baltimore, MD 21287 USA; [Li, Linheng] Univ Kansas, Med Ctr, Dept Pathol & Lab Med, Kansas City, KS 66160 USA","Li, LH (reprint author), Stowers Inst Med Res, Kansas City, MO 64110 USA.",lil@stowers.org,"Sanchez, Rebeca/L-7138-2014","Sanchez, Rebeca/0000-0002-2073-2810","Stowers Institute for Medical Research; Department of Biotechnology, Ministry of Science and Technology, Government of India; National Institutes of Health [GM51279]","We thank M.

T6SS is responsible for translocation of a wide range of toxic effector molecules, allowing predatory cells to kill both prokaryotic as well as eukaryotic prey cells(1-5). The T6SS organelle is functionally analogous to contractile tails of bacteriophages and is thought to attack cells by initially penetrating them with a trimeric protein complex called the VgrG spike(6,7). Neither the exact protein composition of the T6SS organelle nor the mechanisms of effector selection and delivery are known. Here we report that proteins from the PAAR (proline-alanine-alanine-arginine) repeat superfamily form a sharp conical extension on the VgrG spike, which is further involved in attaching effector domains to the spike. The crystal structures of two PAAR-repeat proteins bound to VgrG-like partners show that these proteins sharpen the tip of the T6SS spike complex. We demonstrate that PAAR proteins are essential for T6SS-mediated secretion and target cell killing by Vibrio cholerae and Acinetobacter baylyi. Our results indicate a new model of the T6SS organelle in which the VgrG-PAAR spike complex is decorated with multiple effectors that are delivered simultaneously into target cells in a single contraction-driven translocation event.","[Shneider, Mikhail M.; Buth, Sergey A.; Leiman, Petr G.] Ecole Polytech Fed Lausanne, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland; [Shneider, Mikhail M.] Shemyakin Ovchinnikov Inst Bioorgan Chem, Lab Mol Bioengn, Moscow 117997, Russia; [Ho, Brian T.; Basler, Marek; Mekalanos, John J.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Microbiol & Immunobiol, Boston, MA 02115 USA","Leiman, PG (reprint author), Ecole Polytech Fed Lausanne, BSP 415, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland.",john_mekalanos@hms.harvard.edu; petr.leiman@epfl.ch,"Leiman, Petr/E-5120-2010; Basler, Marek/A-3559-2012; Buth, Sergey/F-9794-2017","Leiman, Petr/0000-0002-9091-0918; Basler, Marek/0000-0001-5414-2088; Buth, Sergey/0000-0003-1922-0866","Swiss National Science Foundation [31003A_127092]; EPFL; NIAID [AI-026289, AI-01845]","We thank the entire staff of the Swiss Light Source PX beamlines and V.

Although the mechanisms of caspase-dependent and -independent cell killing have been examined extensively, how these pathways are coordinated within a single cell that is fated to die is unknown. Here we show that the Caenorhabditis elegans Sp1 transcription factor SPTF-3 specifies the programmed cell deaths of at least two cells-the sisters of the pharyngeal M4 motor neuron and the AQR sensory neuron-by transcriptionally activating both caspase-dependent and -independent apoptotic pathways. SPTF-3 directly drives the transcription of the geneegl-1, which encodes a BH3-only protein that promotes apoptosis through the activation of the CED-3 caspase(3). In addition, SPTF-3 directly drives the transcription of the AMP-activated protein kinase-related gene pig-1, which encodes a protein kinase and functions in apoptosis of the M4 sister and AQR sister independently of the pathway that activates-CED-3 (refs 4, 5). Thus, a single transcription factor controls two distinct cell-killing programs that act in parallel to drive apoptosis. Our findings reveal a bivalent regulatory node for caspase-dependent and -independent pathways in the regulation of cell-type-specific apoptosis. We propose that such nodes might act as features of a general mechanism for regulating cell-type-specific apoptosis and could be therapeutic targets for diseases involving the dysregulation of apoptosis through multiple cell-killing mechanisms.","[Hirose, Takashi; Horvitz, H.

Here we demonstrate that the actomyosin cortex and the junction-localized neoplastic tumour suppressors Scribbled and Discs large 1 have essential roles in planar spindle alignment and thus the control of epithelial integrity in the Drosophila imaginal disc. We show that defective alignment of the mitotic spindle correlates with cell delamination and apoptotic death, and that blocking the death of misaligned cells is sufficient to drive the formation of basally localized tumour-like masses.

T-boxes reside in the 5'-untranslated regions of the messenger RNAs they regulate, and consist of two conserved domains. Stem I contains the specifier trinucleotide that base pairs with the anticodon of cognate tRNA. 3' to stem I is the antiterminator domain, which base pairs with the tRNA acceptor end and evaluates its aminoacylation state(2). Despite high phylogenetic conservation and widespread occurrence in pathogens, the structural basis of tRNA recognition(3,4) by this riboswitch remains ill defined. Here we demonstrate that the similar to 100-nucleotide T-box stem I is necessary and sufficient for specific, high-affinity (dissociation constant (K-d) similar to 150 nM) tRNA binding, and report the structure of Oceanobacillus iheyensis glyQ stem I in complex with its cognate tRNA at 3.2 angstrom resolution. Stem I recognizes the overall architecture of tRNA in addition to its anticodon, something accomplished by large ribonucleoproteins such as the ribosome, or proteins such as aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases(5), but is unprecedented for a compact mRNA domain. The C-shaped stem I cradles the L-shaped tRNA, forming an extended (1,604 angstrom(2)) intermolecular interface. In addition to the specifier-anticodon interaction, two interdigitated T-loops near the apex of stem I stack on the tRNA elbow in a manner analogous to those of the J11/12-J12/11 motif(6) of RNase P and the L1 stalk(7) of the ribosomal E-site. Because these ribonucleoproteins and T-boxes are unrelated, this strategy to recognize a universal tRNA feature probably evolved convergently. Mutually induced fit of stem I and the tRNA exploiting the intrinsic flexibility of tRNA and its conserved post-transcriptional modifications results in high shape complementarity, which in addition to providing specificity and affinity, globally organizes the T-box to orchestrate tRNA-dependent transcription regulation.","[Zhang, Jinwei; Ferre-D'Amare, Adrian R.] NHLBI, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA","Ferre-D'Amare, AR (reprint author), NHLBI, 50 South Dr,MSC 8012, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA.",adrian.ferre@nih.gov,,,"National Institute for General Medical Sciences, National Institutes of Health (NIH); US Department of Energy; intramural program of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, NIH","We thank the staff at beamlines 24-ID-C and 24-ID-E of APS and 5.0.1 and 5.0.2 of the ALS for crystallographic data collection support, G.

For the nervous system, in which high resolution and large spatial extent are both needed, such maps are scarce as they challenge data acquisition and analysis capabilities. Here we present for the mouse inner plexiform layer-the main computational neuropil region in the mammalian retina-the dense reconstruction of 950 neurons and their mutual contacts. This was achieved by applying a combination of crowd-sourced manual annotation and machine-learning-based volume segmentation to serial block-face electron microscopy data. We characterize a new type of retinal bipolar interneuron and show that we can subdivide a known type based on connectivity. Circuit motifs that emerge from our data indicate a functional mechanism for a known cellular response in a ganglion cell that detects localized motion, and predict that another ganglion cell is motion sensitive.","[Helmstaedter, Moritz; Briggman, Kevin L.; Denk, Winfried] Max Planck Inst Med Res, D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany; [Turaga, Srinivas C.; Jain, Viren; Seung, H.

For example, despite intensive investigations over half a century, the neuronal implementation of local motion detection in the insect visual system remains elusive. Here we develop a semi-automated pipeline using electron microscopy to reconstruct a connectome, containing 379 neurons and 8,637 chemical synaptic contacts, within the Drosophila optic medulla. By matching reconstructed neurons to examples from light microscopy, we assigned neurons to cell types and assembled a connectome of the repeating module of the medulla. Within this module, we identified cell types constituting a motion detection circuit, and showed that the connections onto individual motion-sensitive neurons in this circuit were consistent with their direction selectivity. Our results identify cellular targets for future functional investigations, and demonstrate that connectomes can provide key insights into neuronal computations.","[Takemura, Shin-ya; Bharioke, Arjun; Lu, Zhiyuan; Nern, Aljoscha; Vitaladevuni, Shiv; Rivlin, Patricia K.; Katz, William T.; Olbris, Donald J.; Plaza, Stephen M.; Winston, Philip; Zhao, Ting; Fetter, Richard D.; Takemura, Satoko; Blazek, Katerina; Chang, Lei-Ann; Ogundeyi, Omotara; Saunders, Mathew A.; Shapiro, Victor; Sigmund, Christopher; Rubin, Gerald M.; Scheffer, Louis K.; Meinertzhagen, Ian A.; Chklovskii, Dmitri B.] HHMI, Ashburn, VA 20147 USA; [Lu, Zhiyuan; Horne, Jane Anne; Meinertzhagen, Ian A.] Dalhousie Univ, Dept Psychol & Neurosci, Halifax, NS B3H 4R2, Canada","Chklovskii, DB (reprint author), HHMI, Janelia Farm Res Campus, Ashburn, VA 20147 USA.",iam@dal.ca; mitya@janelia.hhmi.org,"Zhao, Ting/C-9500-2014; Marion-Poll, Frederic/D-8882-2011","Marion-Poll, Frederic/0000-0001-6824-0180; Katz, William/0000-0002-9417-6212; Takemura, Shin-ya/0000-0003-2400-6426; Meinertzhagen, Ian/0000-0002-6578-4526; Rubin, Gerald/0000-0001-8762-8703",Howard Hughes Medical Institute,,,59,208,208,4,97,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,8-Aug,2013,500,7461,,,,,175,+,,10.1038/nature12450,,9,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,197CH,WOS:000322825500028,23925240,No,Y,N,11/20/17
