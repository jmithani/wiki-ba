BRCA1 participates in the DNA damage response and acts as a ubiquitin ligase. However, its regulation remains poorly understood. Here we report that BRCA1 is modified by small ubiquitin-like modifier ( SUMO) in response to genotoxic stress, and co-localizes at sites of DNA damage with SUMO1, SUMO2/3 and the SUMO-conjugating enzyme Ubc9. PIAS SUMO E3 ligases co-localize with and modulate SUMO modification of BRCA1, and are required for BRCA1 ubiquitin ligase activity in cells. In vitro SUMO modification of the BRCA1/BARD1 heterodimer greatly increases its ligase activity, identifying it as a SUMO-regulated ubiquitin ligase (SRUbL). Further, PIAS SUMO ligases are required for complete accumulation of double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) damage-repair proteins subsequent to RNF8 accrual, and for proficient double-strand break repair. These data demonstrate that the SUMOylation pathway plays a significant role in mammalian DNA damage response.","[Morris, Joanna R.; Densham, Ruth; Weekes, Daniel; Alamshah, Amin; Butler, Laura; Pangon, Laurent; Solomon, Ellen] Kings Coll London, Dept Med & Mol Genet, London SE1 9RT, England; [Boutell, Chris] MRC, Virol Unit, Glasgow G11 5JR, Lanark, Scotland; [Keppler, Melanie; Kiuchi, Tai; Ng, Tony] Kings Coll London, Richard Dimbleby Dept Canc Res, Randall Div Cell & Mol Biophys, London SE1 1UL, England; [Galanty, Yaron] Univ Cambridge, Wellcome Trust Canc Res UK Gurdon Inst, Cambridge CB2 1QN, England; [Galanty, Yaron] Univ Cambridge, Dept Zool, Cambridge CB2 1QN, England","Morris, JR (reprint author), Kings Coll London, Dept Med & Mol Genet, Guys Med Sch Campus, London SE1 9RT, England.",jo.morris@genetics.kcl.ac.uk,,", Laura/0000-0001-7508-9650; Weekes, Daniel/0000-0001-8083-7617; Boutell, Chris/0000-0002-2970-7785","Breast Cancer Campaign [SF06, 06NovPHD13Morris]; Cancer Research UK [C8820/A9494]; Medical Research Council [6900577]; Richard Dimbleby Cancer Fund; Breakthrough Breast Cancer; MRC Co-operative Group [G0100152, 56891]; UK Research Councils Basic Technology Research Programme [GR/R87901/01]","We are grateful to V.

Because such characterization studies are feasible only for transiting systems that are both nearby and for which the planet-to-star radius ratio is relatively large, nearby small stars have been surveyed intensively. Doppler studies(4-6) and microlensing(7) have uncovered a population of planets with minimum masses of 1.9-10 times the Earth's mass (M(circle plus)), called super-Earths. The first constraint on the bulk composition of this novel class of planets was afforded by CoRoT-7b (refs 8, 9), but the distance and size of its star preclude atmospheric studies in the foreseeable future. Here we report observations of the transiting planet GJ 1214b, which has a mass of 6.55M(circle plus) and a radius 2.68 times Earth's radius (R(circle plus)), indicating that it is intermediate in stature between Earth and the ice giants of the Solar System. We find that the planetary mass and radius are consistent with a composition of primarily water enshrouded by a hydrogen-helium envelope that is only 0.05% of the mass of the planet. The atmosphere is probably escaping hydrodynamically, indicating that it has undergone significant evolution during its history. The star is small and only 13 parsecs away, so the planetary atmosphere is amenable to study with current observatories.","[Charbonneau, David; Berta, Zachory K.; Irwin, Jonathan; Burke, Christopher J.; Nutzman, Philip; Buchhave, Lars A.; Latham, David W.; Murray-Clay, Ruth A.; Holman, Matthew J.; Falco, Emilio E.] Harvard Smithsonian Ctr Astrophys, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Buchhave, Lars A.] Univ Copenhagen, Niels Bohr Inst, DK-2100 Copenhagen, Denmark; [Lovis, Christophe; Bonfils, Xavier; Udry, Stephane; Queloz, Didier; Pepe, Francesco; Mayor, Michel] Univ Geneva, Observ Geneva, CH-1290 Sauverny, Switzerland; [Bonfils, Xavier; Delfosse, Xavier; Forveille, Thierry] Univ Grenoble 1, CNRS, UMR 5571, Lab Astrophys Grenoble LAOG, F-38041 Grenoble 09, France; [Winn, Joshua N.] MIT, Dept Phys, Kavli Inst Astrophys & Space Res, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA","Charbonneau, D (reprint author), Harvard Smithsonian Ctr Astrophys, 60 Garden St, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",dcharbonneau@cfa.harvard.edu,,"Berta-Thompson, Zachory/0000-0002-3321-4924; Bonfils, Xavier/0000-0001-9003-8894; Buchhave, Lars A./0000-0003-1605-5666; Charbonneau, David/0000-0002-9003-484X","David and Lucile Packard Foundation Fellowship for Science and Engineering; US National Science Foundation [AST-0807690]; NASA [NCC2-1390, NNX09AB33G]; European Southern Observatory Director's Discretionary [283.C-5022]","We thank M.

Measurements of its size distribution constrain its accretion and collisional history, and the importance of material strength of Kuiper belt objects(1-4). Small, sub-kilometre-sized, Kuiper belt objects elude direct detection, but the signature of their occultations of background stars should be detectable(5-9). Observations at both optical(10) and X-ray(11) wavelengths claim to have detected such occultations, but their implied abundances are inconsistent with each other and far exceed theoretical expectations. Here we report an analysis of archival data that reveals an occultation by a body with an approximately 500-metre radius at a distance of 45 astronomical units. The probability of this event arising from random statistical fluctuations within our data set is about two per cent. Our survey yields a surface density of Kuiper belt objects with radii exceeding 250 metres of 2.1(-1.7)(+4.8) x 10(7) deg(-2), ruling out inferred surface densities from previous claimed detections by more than 5 sigma. The detection of only one event reveals a deficit of sub-kilometre-sized Kuiper belt objects compared to a population extrapolated from objects with radii exceeding 50 kilometres. This implies that sub-kilometre-sized objects are undergoing collisional erosion, just like debris disks observed around other stars.","[Schlichting, H. E.; Ofek, E.

An extension into the quantum domain is desirable as it could allow the production of non-trivial quantum states(1-4) and protection against decoherence(5,6). The difficulties associated with quantum, as opposed to classical, feedback arise from the quantum measurement process-in particular the quantum projection noise and the limited measurement rate-as well as from quantum fluctuations perturbing the evolution in a driven open system. Here we demonstrate real-time feedback control(7-12) of the motion of a single atom trapped in an optical cavity. Individual probe photons carrying information about the atomic position(13,14) activate a dipole laser that steers the atom on timescales 70 times shorter than the atom's oscillation period in the trap. Depending on the specific implementation, the trapping time is increased by a factor of more than four owing to feedback cooling, which can remove almost all the kinetic energy of the atom in a quarter of an oscillation period(12). Our results show that the detected photon flux reflects the atomic motion, and thus mark a step towards the exploration of the quantum trajectory(15,16) of a single atom at the standard quantum limit.","[Kubanek, A.; Koch, M.; Sames, C.; Ourjoumtsev, A.; Pinkse, P.

Given the nature of interactions(4-8) between electrons and photons, and considering their connections(9,10) through nanostructures, it should be possible to achieve imaging of evanescent electromagnetic fields with electron pulses when such fields are resolved in both space (nanometre and below) and time (femtosecond) (11-13). Here we report the development of photon-induced near-field electron microscopy (PINEM), and the associated phenomena. We show that the precise spatiotemporal overlap of femtosecond single-electron packets with intense optical pulses at a nanostructure (individual carbon nanotube or silver nanowire in this instance) results in the direct absorption of integer multiples of photon quanta (nh omega) by the relativistic electrons accelerated to 200 keV. By energy-filtering only those electrons resulting from this absorption, it is possible to image directly in space the near-field electric field distribution, obtain the temporal behaviour of the field on the femtosecond timescale, and map its spatial polarization dependence. We believe that the observation of the photon-induced near-field effect in ultrafast electron microscopy demonstrates the potential for many applications, including those of direct space-time imaging of localized fields at interfaces and visualization of phenomena related to photonics, plasmonics and nanostructures.","[Barwick, Brett; Flannigan, David J.; Zewail, Ahmed H.] CALTECH, Arthur Amos Noyes Lab Chem Phys, Phys Biol Ctr Ultrafast Sci & Technol, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA","Zewail, AH (reprint author), CALTECH, Arthur Amos Noyes Lab Chem Phys, Phys Biol Ctr Ultrafast Sci & Technol, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA.",zewail@caltech.edu,"Flannigan, David/E-4449-2014","Flannigan, David/0000-0002-1829-1868; gaber, sarah/0000-0002-5995-7291",National Science Foundation; Air Force Office of Scientific Research in the Gordon; Betty Moore Center for Physical Biology at the California Institute of Technology,This work was supported by the National Science Foundation and the Air Force Office of Scientific Research in the Gordon and Betty Moore Center for Physical Biology at the California Institute of Technology.

Explanations for fault weakness include the presence of weak minerals(4), high fluid pressures within the fault core(8,9) and dynamic processes such as normal stress reduction(10), acoustic fluidization(11) or extreme weakening at high slip velocity(12-14). Dynamic weakening mechanisms can explain some observations; however, creep and aseismic slip are thought to occur on weak faults, and quasi-static weakening mechanisms are required to initiate frictional slip on mis-oriented faults, at high angles to the tectonic stress field. Moreover, the maintenance of high fluid pressures requires specialized conditions(15) and weak mineral phases are not present in sufficient abundance to satisfy weak fault models(16), so weak faults remain largely unexplained. Here we provide laboratory evidence for a brittle, frictional weakening mechanism based on common fault zone fabrics. We report on the frictional strength of intact fault rocks sheared in their in situ geometry. Samples with well-developed foliation are extremely weak compared to their powdered equivalents. Micro- and nanostructural studies show that frictional sliding occurs along very fine-grained foliations composed of phyllosilicates ( talc and smectite). When the same rocks are powdered, frictional strength is high, consistent with cataclastic processes. Our data show that fault weakness can occur in cases where weak mineral phases constitute only a small percentage of the total fault rock and that low friction results from slip on a network of weak phyllosilicate-rich surfaces that define the rock fabric. The widespread documentation of foliated fault rocks along mature faults in different tectonic settings and from many different protoliths(4,17- 19) suggests that this mechanism could be a viable explanation for fault weakening in the brittle crust.","[Collettini, Cristiano] Univ Perugia, Dipartimento Sci Terra, I-06100 Perugia, Italy; [Niemeijer, Andre; Marone, Chris] Penn State Univ, Dept Geosci, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Niemeijer, Andre; Marone, Chris] Penn State Univ, Energy Inst, Ctr Geomech Geofluids & Geohazards, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Viti, Cecilia] Univ Siena, Dipartimento Sci Terra, I-53100 Siena, Italy","Collettini, C (reprint author), Univ Perugia, Dipartimento Sci Terra, I-06100 Perugia, Italy.",colle@unipg.it,,"collettini, cristiano/0000-0002-4828-2516; Niemeijer, Andre/0000-0003-3983-9308","NSF [OCE-0196462, EAR-0510182, INGV-DPC S5]; ERC [205175]","We thank I.

The size distributions of casualties both in whole wars from 1816 to 1980 and terrorist attacks have separately been shown to follow approximate power-law distributions(6,7,9,10). However, the possibility of universal patterns ranging across wars in the size distribution or timing of within-conflict events has barely been explored. Here we show that the sizes and timing of violent events within different insurgent conflicts exhibit remarkable similarities. We propose a unified model of human insurgency that reproduces these commonalities, and explains conflict-specific variations quantitatively in terms of underlying rules of engagement. Our model treats each insurgent population as an ecology of dynamically evolving, self-organized groups following common decision-making processes. Our model is consistent with several recent hypotheses about modern insurgency(18-20), is robust to many generalizations(21), and establishes a quantitative connection between human insurgency, global terrorism(10) and ecology(13-17,22,23).

Earlier studies have shown that such learning induces an increase in the efficacy of synapses in the primary motor cortex, the persistence of which is associated with retention of the task(3-5). However, how motor learning affects neuronal circuitry at the level of individual synapses and how long-lasting memory is structurally encoded in the intact brain remain unknown. Here we show that synaptic connections in the living mouse brain rapidly respond to motor-skill learning and permanently rewire. Training in a forelimb reaching task leads to rapid (within an hour) formation of postsynaptic dendritic spines on the output pyramidal neurons in the contralateral motor cortex. Although selective elimination of spines that existed before training gradually returns the overall spine density back to the original level, the new spines induced during learning are preferentially stabilized during subsequent training and endure long after training stops. Furthermore, we show that different motor skills are encoded by different sets of synapses. Practice of novel, but not previously learned, tasks further promotes dendritic spine formation in adulthood. Our findings reveal that rapid, but long-lasting, synaptic reorganization is closely associated with motor learning. The data also suggest that stabilized neuronal connections are the foundation of durable motor memory.","[Xu, Tonghui; Yu, Xinzhu; Perlik, Andrew J.; Tobin, Willie F.; Zweig, Jonathan A.; Zuo, Yi] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Mol Cell & Dev Biol, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA; [Tennant, Kelly; Jones, Theresa] Univ Texas Austin, Dept Psychol, Inst Neurosci, Austin, TX 78712 USA","Zuo, Y (reprint author), Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Mol Cell & Dev Biol, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA.",zuo@biology.ucsc.edu,"Jones, Theresa/F-1182-2010","Jones, Theresa/0000-0003-0906-6439",Ellison Medical Foundation; DANA Foundation; National Institute on Aging,"We thank D.

However, it is unknown how neural circuits undergo continuous synaptic changes during learning while maintaining lifelong memories. Here we show, by following postsynaptic dendritic spines over time in the mouse cortex(7,8), that learning and novel sensory experience lead to spine formation and elimination by a protracted process. The extent of spine remodelling correlates with behavioural improvement after learning, suggesting a crucial role of synaptic structural plasticity in memory formation. Importantly, a small fraction of new spines induced by novel experience, together with most spines formed early during development and surviving experience-dependent elimination, are preserved and provide a structural basis for memory retention throughout the entire life of an animal. These studies indicate that learning and daily sensory experience leave minute but permanent marks on cortical connections and suggest that lifelong memories are stored in largely stably connected synaptic networks.","[Yang, Guang; Pan, Feng; Gan, Wen-Biao] NYU, Sch Med,Helen & Martin Kimmel Ctr Biol & Med, Skirball Inst Biomol Med,Dept Physiol & Neurosci, Mol Neurobiol Program, New York, NY 10016 USA","Gan, WB (reprint author), NYU, Sch Med,Helen & Martin Kimmel Ctr Biol & Med, Skirball Inst Biomol Med,Dept Physiol & Neurosci, Mol Neurobiol Program, New York, NY 10016 USA.",gan@saturn.med.nyu.edu,,"Yang, Guang/0000-0002-5739-9126",National Institutes of Health [R01 NS047325]; Dart Foundation Fellowship; Ellison/AFAR Postdoctoral Fellowship,This work was supported by National Institutes of Health R01 NS047325 and a Dart Foundation Fellowship to W.-B.

Indeed, they drive cells out of quiescence, and the 'cancer cell cycle' in Rb1 null cells is E2f-dependent(1,2). Absence of activating E2fs in flies or mammalian fibroblasts causes cell cycle arrest(3,4), but this block is alleviated by removing repressive E2f or the tumour suppressor p53, respectively(5-7). Thus, whether activating E2fs are indispensable for normal division is an area of debate(1). Activating E2fs are also well known pro-apoptotic factors, providing a defence against oncogenesis(8), yet E2f1 can limit irradiation-induced apoptosis(9,10). In flies this occurs through repression of hid (also called Wrinkled; Smac/Diablo in mammals). However, in mammals the mechanism is unclear because Smac/Diablo is induced, not repressed, by E2f1(11), and in keratinocytes survival is promoted indirectly through induction of DNA repair targets(12). Thus, a direct pro-survival function for E2f1-3 and/or its relevance beyond irradiation has not been established. To address E2f1-3 function in normal cells in vivo we focused on the mouse retina, which is a relatively simple central nervous system component that can be manipulated genetically without compromising viability and has provided considerable insight into development and cancer(2,13). Here we show that unlike fibroblasts, E2f1-3 null retinal progenitor cells or activated Muller glia can divide. We attribute this effect to functional interchangeability with Mycn. However, loss of activating E2fs caused down-regulation of the p53 deacetylase Sirt1, p53 hyperacetylation and elevated apoptosis, establishing a novel E2f-Sirt1-p53 survival axis in vivo. Thus, activating E2fs are not universally required for normal mammalian cell division, but have an unexpected pro-survival role in development.","[Chen, Danian; Pacal, Marek; Bremner, Rod] Univ Toronto, Univ Hlth Network, Toronto Western Res Inst, Dept Ophthalmol & Visual Sci, Toronto, ON M5T 2S8, Canada; [Chen, Danian; Pacal, Marek; Bremner, Rod] Univ Toronto, Dept Lab Med & Pathobiol, Toronto, ON M5T 2S8, Canada; [Wenzel, Pamela; Leone, Gustavo] Ohio State Univ, Ctr Comprehens Canc, Dept Mol Virol Immunol & Med Genet, Human Canc Genet Program, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Wenzel, Pamela; Leone, Gustavo] Ohio State Univ, Ctr Comprehens Canc, Dept Mol Genet, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Knoepfler, Paul S.] Univ Calif Davis, Sch Med, Dept Cell Biol, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Knoepfler, Paul S.] Univ Calif Davis, Sch Med, Dept Human Anat, Davis, CA 95616 USA","Bremner, R (reprint author), Univ Toronto, Univ Hlth Network, Toronto Western Res Inst, Dept Ophthalmol & Visual Sci, Toronto, ON M5T 2S8, Canada.",rbremner@uhnres.utoronto.ca,"Wenzel, Pamela/A-2992-2010; Bremner, Rod/I-6490-2012","Bremner, Rod/0000-0001-9184-7212; Wenzel, Pamela L./0000-0002-4530-015X; Chen, Danian/0000-0002-6916-2978",Canadian Institutes for Health Research [MOP-74570],We thank L. van Parijs and R.

Using a panel of tissue-specific cre-transgenic mice and conditional E2f alleles we examined the effects of E2f1, E2f2 and E2f3 triple deficiency in murine embryonic stem cells, embryos and small intestines. We show that in normal dividing progenitor cells E2f1-3 function as transcriptional activators, but contrary to the current view, are dispensable for cell division and instead are necessary for cell survival. In differentiating cells E2f1-3 function in a complex with Rb as repressors to silence E2f targets and facilitate exit from the cell cycle. The inactivation of Rb in differentiating cells resulted in a switch of E2f1-3 from repressors to activators, leading to the superactivation of E2f responsive targets and ectopic cell divisions. Loss of E2f1-3 completely suppressed these phenotypes caused by Rb deficiency. This work contextualizes the activator versus repressor functions of E2f1-3 in vivo, revealing distinct roles in dividing versus differentiating cells and in normal versus cancer-like cell cycles.","[Chong, Jean-Leon; Wenzel, Pamela L.; Nair, Vivek; Ferrey, Antoney; Hagan, John P.; Gomez, Yorman M.; Sharma, Nidhi; Chen, Hui-Zi; Ouseph, Madhu; Wang, Shu-Huei; Trikha, Prashant; Culp, Brian; Mezache, Louise; Leone, Gustavo] Ohio State Univ, Coll Med, Dept Mol Virol Immunol & Med Genet, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Chong, Jean-Leon; Wenzel, Pamela L.; Nair, Vivek; Ferrey, Antoney; Gomez, Yorman M.; Sharma, Nidhi; Chen, Hui-Zi; Ouseph, Madhu; Wang, Shu-Huei; Trikha, Prashant; Culp, Brian; Mezache, Louise; Leone, Gustavo] Ohio State Univ, Coll Biol Sci, Dept Mol Genet, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Chong, Jean-Leon; Wenzel, Pamela L.; Nair, Vivek; Ferrey, Antoney; Hagan, John P.; Gomez, Yorman M.; Sharma, Nidhi; Chen, Hui-Zi; Ouseph, Madhu; Wang, Shu-Huei; Trikha, Prashant; Culp, Brian; Mezache, Louise; Leone, Gustavo] Ohio State Univ, Ctr Comprehens Canc, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Saenz-Robles, M.

Following DSB formation, cells activate the DNA-damage response (DDR) protein kinases ATM, ATR and DNA-PK (also known as PRKDC). These then trigger histone H2AX (also known as H2AFX) phosphorylation and the accumulation of proteins such as MDC1, 53BP1 (also known as TP53BP1), BRCA1, CtIP (also known as RBBP8), RNF8 and RNF168/RIDDLIN into ionizing radiation-induced foci (IRIF) that amplify DSB signalling and promote DSB repair(1,2). Attachment of small ubiquitin-related modifier (SUMO) to target proteins controls diverse cellular functions(3-6). Here, we show that SUMO1, SUMO2 and SUMO3 accumulate at DSB sites in mammalian cells, with SUMO1 and SUMO2/3 accrual requiring the E3 ligase enzymes PIAS4 and PIAS1. We also establish that PIAS1 and PIAS4 are recruited to damage sites via mechanisms requiring their SAP domains, and are needed for the productive association of 53BP1, BRCA1 and RNF168 with such regions. Furthermore, we show that PIAS1 and PIAS4 promote DSB repair and confer ionizing radiation resistance. Finally, we establish that PIAS1 and PIAS4 are required for effective ubiquitin-adduct formation mediated by RNF8, RNF168 and BRCA1 at sites of DNA damage(7-11). These findings thus identify PIAS1 and PIAS4 as components of the DDR and reveal how protein recruitment to DSB sites is controlled by coordinated SUMOylation and ubiquitylation.","[Galanty, Yaron; Belotserkovskaya, Rimma; Coates, Julia; Polo, Sophie; Miller, Kyle M.; Jackson, Stephen P.] Univ Cambridge, Wellcome Trust & Canc Res UK Gurdon Inst, Cambridge CB2 1QN, England; [Galanty, Yaron; Belotserkovskaya, Rimma; Coates, Julia; Polo, Sophie; Miller, Kyle M.; Jackson, Stephen P.] Univ Cambridge, Dept Biochem, Cambridge CB2 1QN, England","Jackson, SP (reprint author), Univ Cambridge, Wellcome Trust & Canc Res UK Gurdon Inst, Tennis Court Rd, Cambridge CB2 1QN, England.",s.jackson@gurdon.cam.ac.uk,"Dry, Kate/I-2328-2014","Polo, Sophie/0000-0003-4821-9354; Miller, Kyle/0000-0002-4544-0013; Jackson, Stephen Philip/0000-0001-9317-7937","Cancer Research UK; European Union [LSHG-CT-2005-512113, HEALTH-F2-2007-201630]","We thank S.

Considering that the lagging-strand polymerase has to recycle after the completion of every Okazaki fragment through the slowsteps of primer synthesis and hand-off to the polymerase(3-5), it is not understood how the two strands are synthesized with the same net rate(6-9). Here we show, using the T7 replication proteins(10,11), that RNA primers are made 'on the fly' during ongoing DNA synthesis and that the leading-strand T7 replisome does not pause during primer synthesis, contrary to previous reports(12,13). Instead, the leading-strand polymerase remains limited by the speed of the helicase(14); it therefore synthesizes DNA more slowly than the lagging-strand polymerase. We show that the primase-helicase T7 gp4 maintains contact with the priming sequence during ongoing DNA synthesis; the nascent lagging-strand template therefore organizes into a priming loop that keeps the primer in physical proximity to the replication complex. Our findings provide three synergistic mechanisms of coordination: first, primers are made concomitantly with DNA synthesis; second, the priming loop ensures efficient primer use and hand-off to the polymerase; and third, the lagging-strand polymerase copies DNA faster, which allows it to keep up with leading-strand DNA synthesis overall.","[Syed, Salman; Ha, Taekjip] Howard Hughes Med Inst, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Pandey, Manjula; Donmez, Ilker; Patel, Gayatri; Patel, Smita S.] Univ Med & Dent New Jersey, Robert Wood Johnson Med Sch, Dept Biochem, Piscataway, NJ 08854 USA; [Ha, Taekjip] Univ Illinois, Dept Phys, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Ha, Taekjip] Univ Illinois, Ctr Phys Living Cells, Urbana, IL 61801 USA","Ha, T (reprint author), Howard Hughes Med Inst, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.",tjha@illinois.edu; patelss@umdnj.edu,"Ha, Taekjip/B-9506-2009","Ha, Taekjip/0000-0003-2195-6258","NIH [GM55310, GM065367]; NSF [0822613, 0646550]","We thank C.

These mutations occur at a single amino acid residue of the IDH1 active site, resulting in loss of the enzyme's ability to catalyse conversion of isocitrate to alpha-ketoglutarate. However, only a single copy of the gene is mutated in tumours, raising the possibility that the mutations do not result in a simple loss of function. Here we show that cancer-associated IDH1 mutations result in a new ability of the enzyme to catalyse the NADPH-dependent reduction of alpha-ketoglutarate to R(2)-2-hydroxyglutarate (2HG). Structural studies demonstrate that when arginine 132 is mutated to histidine, residues in the active site are shifted to produce structural changes consistent with reduced oxidative decarboxylation of isocitrate and acquisition of the ability to convert alpha-ketoglutarate to 2HG. Excess accumulation of 2HG has been shown to lead to an elevated risk of malignant brain tumours in patients with inborn errors of 2HG metabolism. Similarly, in human malignant gliomas harbouring IDH1 mutations, we find markedly elevated levels of 2HG. These data demonstrate that the IDH1 mutations result in production of the onco-metabolite 2HG, and indicate that the excess 2HG which accumulates in vivo contributes to the formation and malignant progression of gliomas.","[Dang, Lenny; White, David W.; Gross, Stefan; Bittinger, Mark A.; Driggers, Edward M.; Fantin, Valeria R.; Jang, Hyun Gyung; Jin, Shengfang; Keenan, Marie C.; Marks, Kevin M.; Yen, Katharine E.; Heiden, Matthew G.

Despite their crucial role in neurobiology, the architecture and atomic structure of an intact ionotropic glutamate receptor are unknown. Here we report the crystal structure of the alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid (AMPA)-sensitive, homotetrameric, rat GluA2 receptor at 3.6 angstrom resolution in complex with a competitive antagonist. The receptor harbours an overall axis of two-fold symmetry with the extracellular domains organized as pairs of local dimers and with the ion channel domain exhibiting four-fold symmetry. A symmetry mismatch between the extracellular and ion channel domains is mediated by two pairs of conformationally distinct subunits, A/C and B/D. Therefore, the stereochemical manner in which the A/C subunits are coupled to the ion channel gate is different from the B/D subunits. Guided by the GluA2 structure and site-directed cysteine mutagenesis, we suggest that GluN1 and GluN2A NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) receptors have a similar architecture, with subunits arranged in a 1-2-1-2 pattern.

Free diffusion of urea across cell membranes is slow owing to its high polarity, and specialized urea transporters have evolved to achieve rapid and selective urea permeation. Here we present the 2.3 angstrom structure of a functional urea transporter from the bacterium Desulfovibrio vulgaris. The transporter is a homotrimer, and each subunit contains a continuous membrane-spanning pore formed by the two homologous halves of the protein. The pore contains a constricted selectivity filter that can accommodate several dehydrated urea molecules in single file. Backbone and side-chain oxygen atoms provide continuous coordination of urea as it progresses through the filter, and well-placed alpha-helix dipoles provide further compensation for dehydration energy. These results establish that the urea transporter operates by a channel-like mechanism and reveal the physical and chemical basis of urea selectivity.","[Levin, Elena J.; Zhou, Ming] Columbia Univ, Coll Phys & Surg, Dept Physiol & Cellular Biophys, New York, NY 10032 USA; [Quick, Matthias] Columbia Univ, Coll Phys & Surg, Dept Psychiat, New York, NY 10032 USA; [Quick, Matthias] New York State Psychiat Inst & Hosp, Div Mol Therapeut, New York, NY 10032 USA","Zhou, M (reprint author), Columbia Univ, Coll Phys & Surg, Dept Physiol & Cellular Biophys, 630 W 168th St, New York, NY 10032 USA.",mz2140@columbia.edu,,,"US National Institutes of Health [HL086392, T32HL087745]; NIH [GM075026]; American Heart Association [0630148N]","We thank R.

Three structures of intrahelical oxoG-encounter complexes are compared with sequence-matched structures containing a normal G base in place of an oxoG lesion. Although the protein-DNA interfaces in the matched complexes differ by only two atoms-those that distinguish oxoG from G-their pronounced structural differences indicate that MutM can detect a lesion in DNA even at the earliest stages of encounter.

In an alternative model, jets are threaded with large-scale magnetic fields that originate at the central engine and that accelerate and collimate the material(4). To distinguish between the models the degree of polarization in early-time emission must be measured; however, previous claims of gamma-ray polarization have been controversial(5-8). Here we report that the early optical emission from GRB 090102 was polarized at 10 +/- 1 per cent, indicating the presence of large-scale fields originating in the expanding fireball.

The active regions of star-burst galaxies have exceptionally high rates of star formation, and their large size-more than 50 times the diameter of similar Galactic regions-uniquely enables reliable calorimetric measurements of their potentially high cosmic-ray density(2). The cosmic rays produced in the formation, life and death of massive stars in these regions are expected to produce diffuse gamma-ray emission through interactions with interstellar gas and radiation. M82, the prototype small starburst galaxy, is predicted(3,4) to be the brightest starburst galaxy in terms of gamma-ray emission. Here we report the detection of >700-GeV gamma-rays from M82. From these data we determine a cosmic-ray density of 250 eV cm(-3) in the starburst core, which is about 500 times the average Galactic density. This links cosmic-ray acceleration to star formation activity, and suggests that supernovae and massive-star winds are the dominant accelerators.","[Acciari, V.

Simple lattice packings of many shapes easily surpass this packing fraction(2,3). For regular tetrahedra, this conjecture was shown to be true only very recently; an ordered arrangement was obtained via geometric construction with phi = 0.7786 (ref. 4), which was subsequently compressed numerically to phi = 0.7820 (ref. 5), while compressing with different initial conditions led to phi = 0.8230 ( ref. 6). Here we show that tetrahedra pack even more densely, and in a completely unexpected way. Following a conceptually different approach, using thermodynamic computer simulations that allow the system to evolve naturally towards high-density states, we observe that a fluid of hard tetrahedra undergoes a first-order phase transition to a dodecagonal quasicrystal(7-10), which can be compressed to a packing fraction of phi = 0.8324. By compressing a crystalline approximant of the quasicrystal, the highest packing fraction we obtain is phi = 0.8503. If quasicrystal formation is suppressed, the system remains disordered, jams and compresses to phi = 0.7858. Jamming and crystallization are both preceded by an entropy-driven transition from a simple fluid of independent tetrahedra to a complex fluid characterized by tetrahedra arranged in densely packed local motifs of pentagonal dipyramids that form a percolating network at the transition. The quasicrystal that we report represents the first example of a quasicrystal formed from hard or non-spherical particles. Our results demonstrate that particle shape and entropy can produce highly complex, ordered structures.","[Haji-Akbari, Amir; Engel, Michael; Keys, Aaron S.; Glotzer, Sharon C.] Univ Michigan, Dept Chem Engn, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Glotzer, Sharon C.] Univ Michigan, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Palffy-Muhoray, Peter] Kent State Univ, Inst Liquid Crystal, Kent, OH 44242 USA; [Zheng, Xiaoyu] Kent State Univ, Dept Math Sci, Kent, OH 44242 USA; [Petschek, Rolfe G.] Case Western Reserve Univ, Dept Phys, Cleveland, OH 44106 USA","Glotzer, SC (reprint author), Univ Michigan, Dept Chem Engn, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",sglotzer@umich.edu,"Haji-Akbari, Amir/G-7969-2011; Keys, Aaron/A-2572-2012; Engel, Michael/G-1778-2010","Engel, Michael/0000-0002-7031-3825",The Air Force Office of Scientific Research; The National Science Foundation; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft,"The Air Force Office of Scientific Research supported A.

The Atlantic waters found a way through the present Gibraltar Strait and rapidly refilled the Mediterranean 5.33 million years ago in an event known as the Zanclean flood(4). The nature, abruptness and evolution of this flood remain poorly constrained(4-6). Borehole and seismic data show incisions over 250 m deep on both sides of the Gibraltar Strait that have previously been attributed to fluvial erosion during the desiccation(4,7). Here we show the continuity of this 200-km-long channel across the strait and explain its morphology as the result of erosion by the flooding waters, adopting an incision model validated in mountain rivers. This model in turn allows us to estimate the duration of the flood. Although the available data are limited, our findings suggest that the feedback between water flow and incision in the early stages of flooding imply discharges of about 10(8) m(3) s(-1) (three orders of magnitude larger than the present Amazon River) and incision rates above 0.4 m per day. Although the flood started at low water discharges that may have lasted for up to several thousand years, our results suggest that 90 per cent of the water was transferred in a short period ranging from a few months to two years. This extremely abrupt flood may have involved peak rates of sea level rise in the Mediterranean of more than ten metres per day.","[Garcia-Castellanos, D.; Jimenez-Munt, I.; Fernandez, M.; Verges, J.; De Vicente, R.] CSIC, Inst Ciencies Terra Jaume Almera, Barcelona, Spain; [Estrada, F.] CSIC, Inst Ciencies Mar, Barcelona, Spain; [Gorini, C.] Univ Paris 06, F-75005 Paris, France; [Gorini, C.] CNRS, ISTEP, UMR 7193, F-75005 Paris, France","Garcia-Castellanos, D (reprint author), CSIC, Inst Ciencies Terra Jaume Almera, Sole & Sabaris S-N, Barcelona, Spain.",danielgc@ictja.csic.es,"Verges, Jaume/D-3070-2011; Fernandez, Manel/A-1628-2012; Garcia-Castellanos, Daniel/B-1203-2008; Jimenez-Munt, Ivone/B-7073-2009; Estrada, Ferran/G-8255-2015","Verges, Jaume/0000-0002-4467-5291; Fernandez, Manel/0000-0002-4487-2359; Garcia-Castellanos, Daniel/0000-0001-8454-8572; Jimenez-Munt, Ivone/0000-0003-4178-3585; ",Spanish Government [CGL2006-05493],"We thank P.

Here we report the thickness of the pPv boundary in (Mg0.91Fe0.092+)SiO3 and (Mg0.9Fe0.13+)(Al0.1Si0.9)O-3 as determined in a laser-heated diamond-anvil cell under in situ high-pressure (up to 145 GPa), high-temperature ( up to 3,000 K) conditions. The measured Clapeyron slope is consistent with the D '' discontinuity(6). In both systems, however, the pPv boundary thickness increases to 400-600 +/- 100 km, which is substantially greater than the thickness of the D '' discontinuity (< 30 km)(7). Although the Fe2+ buffering effect of ferropericlase(8-10) could decrease the pPv boundary thickness, the boundary may remain thick in a pyrolitic composition because of the effects of Al and the rapid temperature increase in the D '' layer. The pPv boundary would be particularly thick in regions with an elevated Al content and/or a low Mg/Si ratio, reducing the effects of the large positive Clapeyron slope on the buoyancy of thermal anomalies and stabilizing compositional heterogeneities in the lowermost mantle. If the pPv transition is the source of the D '' discontinuity, regions with sharp discontinuities may require distinct compositions, such as a higher Mg/Si ratio or a lower Al content.","[Catalli, Krystle; Shim, Sang-Heon] MIT, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Prakapenka, Vitali] Univ Chicago, GeoSoilEnviroCARS, Chicago, IL 60637 USA","Shim, SH (reprint author), MIT, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",sangshim@mit.edu,,"Shim, Sang-Heon/0000-0001-5203-6038",US National Science Foundation (NSF) [EAR0738655]; US Department of Energy ( DOE) National Nuclear Security Administration Stewardship Science Graduate Fellowship,"This work is supported by the US National Science Foundation (NSF) grant EAR0738655 (S.-H.

Classic sexual selection theory notes that because sperm are cheaper to produce than eggs(2), and because males generally compete more intensely for reproductive opportunities and invest less in parental care than females(3), males can obtain greater fitness benefits from mating multiply(2,4). Therefore, sexual selection typically results in male-biased sex differences in secondary sexual characters(1,4). This generality has recently been questioned, because in cooperatively breeding vertebrates, the strength of selection on traits used in intra-sexual competition for access to mates (sexual selection(1,4)) or other resources linked to reproduction (social selection(5,6)) is similar in males and females(7,8). Because selection is acting with comparable intensity in both sexes in cooperatively breeding species, the degree of sexual dimorphism in traits used in intrasexual competition should be reduced in cooperative breeders(6). Here we use the socially diverse African starlings (Sturnidae) to demonstrate that the degree of sexual dimorphism in plumage and body size is reduced in cooperatively breeding species as a result of increased selection on females for traits that increase access to reproductive opportunities, other resources, or higher social status. In cooperative breeders such as these, where there is unequal sharing of reproduction (reproductive skew) among females, and where female dominance rank influences access to mates and other resources, intrasexual competition among females may be intense(7) and ultimately select for female trait elaboration(9). Selection is thereby acting with different intensities on males and females in cooperatively versus non-cooperatively breeding species, and female-female interactions in group-living vertebrates will have important consequences for the evolution of female morphological, physiological and behavioural traits.","[Rubenstein, Dustin R.] Columbia Univ, Dept Ecol Evolut & Environm Biol, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Rubenstein, Dustin R.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Integrat Biol, Museum Vertebrate Zool, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Rubenstein, Dustin R.; Lovette, Irby J.] Cornell Lab Ornithol, Fuller Evolutionary Biol Program, Ithaca, NY 14850 USA","Rubenstein, DR (reprint author), Columbia Univ, Dept Ecol Evolut & Environm Biol, 10th Floor Schermerhorn Extens,1200 Amsterdam Ave, New York, NY 10027 USA.",dr2497@columbia.edu,"Rubenstein, Dustin/A-3451-2015","Rubenstein, Dustin/0000-0002-4999-3723","NSF [DEB-0515981]; Miller Institute for Basic Research in Science at the University of California, Berkeley","This research was supported by grants from NSF to I.

Several mechanisms for left-right asymmetry determination have been proposed for vertebrates(1-10) and invertebrates(1,2,4,9,11-14) but they are still not well characterized, particularly at the early developmental stage. The gastropods Lymnaea stagnalis and the closely related Lymnaea peregra have both the sinistral (recessive) and the dextral (dominant) snails within a species and the chirality is hereditary, determined by a single locus that functions maternally(15-18). Intriguingly, the handedness-determining gene(s) and the mechanisms are not yet identified. Here we show that in L. stagnalis, the chiral blastomere arrangement at the eight-cell stage (but not the two-or four-cell stage) determines the left-right asymmetry throughout the developmental programme, and acts upstream of the Nodal signalling pathway. Thus, we could demonstrate that mechanical micromanipulation of the third cleavage chirality (from the four-to the eight-cell stage) leads to reversal of embryonic handedness. These manipulated embryos grew to 'dextralized' sinistral and 'sinistralized' dextral snails-that is, normal healthy fertile organisms with all the usual left-right asymmetries reversed to that encoded by the mothers' genetic information. Moreover, manipulation reversed the embryonic nodal expression patterns. Using backcrossed F-7 congenic animals, we could demonstrate a strong genetic linkage between the handedness-determining gene( s) and the chiral cytoskeletal dynamics at the third cleavage that promotes the dominant-type blastomere arrangement. These results establish the crucial importance of the maternally determined blastomere arrangement at the eight-cell stage in dictating zygotic signalling pathways in the organismal chiromorphogenesis. Similar chiral blastomere configuration mechanisms may also operate upstream of the Nodal pathway in left-right patterning of deuterostomes/vertebrates.","[Kuroda, Reiko] Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Arts & Sci, Dept Life Sci, Meguro Ku, Tokyo 1538902, Japan; [Kuroda, Reiko; Endo, Bunshiro; Abe, Masanori; Shimizu, Miho] JST, ERATO SORST, Kuroda Chiromorphol Team, Meguro Ku, Tokyo 1530041, Japan; [Kuroda, Reiko] Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Sci, Dept Biophys & Biochem, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo 1130033, Japan","Kuroda, R (reprint author), Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Arts & Sci, Dept Life Sci, Meguro Ku, Tokyo 1538902, Japan.",ckuroda@mail.ecc.u-tokyo.ac.jp,"Shimizu, Miho/Q-8522-2017","Shimizu, Miho/0000-0003-4070-8209",,,,27,79,81,1,49,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,10-Dec,2009,462,7274,,,,,790,U112,,10.1038/nature08597,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,529ZZ,WOS:000272559900039,19940849,No,,,11/20/17

The elemental stoichiometry of microoorganisms is fundamental for understanding the production dynamics and biogeochemical cycles of ecosystems because microbial biomass is the trophic base of detrital food webs(4-6). Here we show that heterotrophic microbial communities of diverse composition from terrestrial soils and freshwater sediments share a common functional stoichiometry in relation to organic nutrient acquisition. The activities of four enzymes that catalyse the hydrolysis of assimilable products from the principal environmental sources of C, N and P show similar scaling relationships over several orders of magnitude, with a mean ratio for C: N: P activities near 1:1:1 in all habitats. We suggest that these ecoenzymatic ratios reflect the equilibria between the elemental composition of microbial biomass and detrital organic matter and the efficiencies of microbial nutrient assimilation and growth. Because ecoenzymatic activities intersect the stoichiometric and metabolic theories of ecology(7-9), they provide a functional measure of the threshold at which control of community metabolism shifts from nutrient to energy flow.","[Sinsabaugh, Robert L.] Univ New Mexico, Dept Biol, Albuquerque, NM 87131 USA; [Hill, Brian H.] US EPA, Natl Hlth & Environm Effects Lab, Duluth, MN 55804 USA; [Shah, Jennifer J.

We are investigating the link between non-coding RNA and chromatin regulation through analysis of FLC - a regulator of flowering time in Arabidopsis and a target of several chromatin pathways. Here we use an unbiased strategy to characterize non-coding transcripts of FLC and show that sense/antisense transcript levels correlate in a range of mutants and treatments, but change independently in cold-treated plants. Prolonged cold epigenetically silences FLC in a Polycomb-mediated process called vernalization(2). Our data indicate that upregulation of long non-coding antisense transcripts covering the entire FLC locus may be part of the cold-sensing mechanism. Induction of these antisense transcripts occurs earlier than, and is independent of, other vernalization markers(3) and coincides with a reduction in sense transcription. We show that addition of the FLC antisense promoter sequences to a reporter gene is sufficient to confer cold-induced silencing of the reporter. Our data indicate that cold-induced FLC antisense transcripts have an early role in the epigenetic silencing of FLC, acting to silence FLC transcription transiently. Recruitment of the Polycomb machinery then confers the epigenetic memory. Antisense transcription events originating from 3' ends of genes might be a general mechanism to regulate the corresponding sense transcription in a condition/stage-dependent manner.","[Swiezewski, Szymon; Liu, Fuquan; Magusin, Andreas; Dean, Caroline] John Innes Ctr Plant Sci Res, Norwich NR4 7UH, Norfolk, England","Dean, C (reprint author), John Innes Ctr Plant Sci Res, Norwich NR4 7UH, Norfolk, England.",caroline.dean@bbsrc.ac.uk,,"Dean, Caroline/0000-0002-6555-3525; Swiezewski, Szymon/0000-0002-2007-2779",BBSRC [BB/D010799/1]; NERC [NE/C507629]; EU SIROCCO [LSHG-CT-2006-037900],"We thank all members of the Dean laboratory for discussions, J.

The nature of elements that activate oncogenes within such translocations has been a long-standing question. Translocations within Igh involve DNA double-strand breaks initiated either by the RAG1/2 endonuclease during variable, diversity and joining gene segment (V(D)J) recombination, or by activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID, also known as AICDA) during class switch recombination (CSR)(2-4). V(D)J recombination in progenitor B (pro-B) cells assembles Igh variable region exons upstream of mu constant region (C mu) exons, which are the first of several sets of CH exons ('C(H) genes') within a CH locus that span several hundred kilobases (kb)(5,6). In mature B cells, CSR deletes C mu and replaces it with a downstream C(H) gene(6). An intronic enhancer (iE mu) between the variable region exons and C mu promotes V(D)J recombination in developing B cells(7). Furthermore, the Igh 3' regulatory region (Igh3' RR) lies downstream of the C(H) locus and modulates CSR by long-range transcriptional enhancement of C(H) genes(8-10). Transgenic mice bearing iE mu or Igh3' RR sequences fused to c-myc are predisposed to B lymphomas, demonstrating that such elements can confer oncogenic c-myc expression(11-16). However, in many B-cell lymphomas, Igh-c-myc translocations delete iE mu and place c-myc up to 200 kb upstream of the Igh3' RR(1). Here we address the oncogenic role of the Igh3' RR by inactivating it in two distinct mouse models for B-cell lymphoma with Igh-c-myc translocations. We show that the Igh3' RR is dispensable for pro-B-cell lymphomas with V( D) J recombination-initiated translocations, but is required for peripheral B-cell lymphomas with CSR-associated translocations. As the Igh3' RR is not required for CSR-associated Igh breaks or Igh-c-myc translocations in peripheral B-cell lymphoma progenitors, we conclude that this regulatory region confers oncogenic activity by long-range and developmental stage-specific activation of translocated c-myc genes.","[Gostissa, Monica; Yan, Catherine T.; Bianco, Julia M.; Alt, Frederick W.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Gostissa, Monica; Yan, Catherine T.; Bianco, Julia M.; Alt, Frederick W.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Childrens Hosp, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Gostissa, Monica; Yan, Catherine T.; Bianco, Julia M.; Alt, Frederick W.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Immune Dis Inst, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Gostissa, Monica; Yan, Catherine T.; Bianco, Julia M.; Alt, Frederick W.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Genet, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Cogne, Michel; Pinaud, Eric] Univ Limoges, CNRS, Fac Med, UMR 6101, Limoges, France","Alt, FW (reprint author), Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Boston, MA 02115 USA.",alt@enders.tch.harvard.edu,"PINAUD, Eric/O-8443-2016; cogne, michel/D-7370-2015","PINAUD, Eric/0000-0001-7405-9273; cogne, michel/0000-0002-8519-4427",National Institutes of Health (NIH) [CA92625]; Leukemia and Lymphoma Society of America (LLS) SCORE; NCI; de Villiers International Achievement Award; Fondation pour la Recherche Medicale; Howard Hughes Medical Institute,We thank L.

Throughout evolution, two editing checkpoints prevent disease-causing mistranslation from confusing glycine or serine for alanine at the active site of AlaRS. In both bacteria and mice, Ser poses a bigger challenge than Gly(1,2). One checkpoint is the AlaRS editing centre, and the other is from widely distributed AlaXps-free-standing, genome-encoded editing proteins that clear Ser-tRNA(Ala). The paradox of misincorporating both a smaller (glycine) and a larger (serine) amino acid suggests a deep conflict for nature-designed AlaRS. Here we show the chemical basis for this conflict. Nine crystal structures, together with kinetic and mutational analysis, provided snapshots of adenylate formation for each amino acid. An inherent dilemma is posed by constraints of a structural design that pins down the alpha-amino group of the bound amino acid by using an acidic residue. This design, dating back more than 3 billion years, creates a serendipitous interaction with the serine OH that is difficult to avoid. Apparently because no better architecture for the recognition of alanine could be found, the serine misactivation problem was solved through free-standing AlaXps, which appeared contemporaneously with early AlaRSs. The results reveal unconventional problems and solutions arising from the historical design of the protein synthesis machinery.","[Guo, Min; Chong, Yeeting E.; Shapiro, Ryan; Beebe, Kirk; Yang, Xiang-Lei; Schimmel, Paul] Scripps Res Inst, Skaggs Inst Chem Biol, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; [Guo, Min; Chong, Yeeting E.; Shapiro, Ryan; Beebe, Kirk; Yang, Xiang-Lei; Schimmel, Paul] Scripps Res Inst, Dept Mol Biol, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA","Schimmel, P (reprint author), Scripps Res Inst, Skaggs Inst Chem Biol, BCC 379,10550 N Torrey Pines Rd, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA.",schimmel@scripps.edu,,,National Institutes of Health [GM 15539]; National Foundation for Cancer Research,"We thank R.J.

Here we demonstrate that reprogramming by these transcription factors is a continuous stochastic process where almost all mouse donor cells eventually give rise to iPS cells on continued growth and transcription factor expression. Additional inhibition of the p53/p21 pathway or overexpression of Lin28 increased the cell division rate and resulted in an accelerated kinetics of iPS cell formation that was directly proportional to the increase in cell proliferation. In contrast, Nanog overexpression accelerated reprogramming in a predominantly cell-division-rate-independent manner. Quantitative analyses define distinct cell-division-rate-dependent and -independent modes for accelerating the stochastic course of reprogramming, and suggest that the number of cell divisions is a key parameter driving epigenetic reprogramming to pluripotency.","[Hanna, Jacob; Saha, Krishanu; Lengner, Christopher J.; Creyghton, Menno P.; Jaenisch, Rudolf] MIT, Whitehead Inst Biomed Res, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; [Pando, Bernardo; van Zon, Jeroen; van Oudenaarden, Alexander] MIT, Dept Phys, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; [van Zon, Jeroen; van Oudenaarden, Alexander; Jaenisch, Rudolf] MIT, Dept Biol, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA","Jaenisch, R (reprint author), MIT, Whitehead Inst Biomed Res, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA.",Hanna@wi.mit.edu; Jaenisch@wi.mit.edu,"HANNA, JACOB/K-1339-2012; Saha, Krishanu/J-3980-2014","HANNA, JACOB/0000-0003-2042-9974; Lengner, Christopher/0000-0002-0574-5189; Saha, Krishanu/0000-0003-2837-0858","NIH [RO1-HDO45022, R37-CA084198, RO1-CA087869]; Helen Hay Whitney Foundation; Society in Science: The Brano- Weiss fellowship; Human Frontiers Science Program; National Cancer Institute [U54CA143874]","We would like to thank N.

Its action is mediated by the PYR/PYL/RCAR family of START proteins, but it remains unclear how these receptors bind ABA and, in turn, how hormone binding leads to inhibition of the downstream type 2C protein phosphatase (PP2C) effectors. Here we report crystal structures of apo and ABA-bound receptors as well as a ternary PYL2-ABA-PP2C complex. The apo receptors contain an open ligand-binding pocket flanked by a gate that closes in response to ABA by way of conformational changes in two highly conserved beta-loops that serve as a gate and latch. Moreover, ABA-induced closure of the gate creates a surface that enables the receptor to dock into and competitively inhibit the PP2C active site. A conserved tryptophan in the PP2C inserts directly between the gate and latch, which functions to further lock the receptor in a closed conformation. Together, our results identify a conserved gate-latch-lock mechanism underlying ABA signalling.","[Melcher, Karsten; Ng, Ley-Moy; Zhou, X.

Here we present the crystal structures of the ABA receptor PYL1 bound with (+)-ABA, and the complex formed by the further binding of (+)-ABA-bound PYL1 with the PP2C protein ABI1. PYL1 binds (+)-ABA using the START-protein-specific ligand-binding site, thereby forming a hydrophobic pocket on the surface of the closed lid. (+)-ABA-bound PYL1 tightly interacts with a PP2C domain of ABI1 by using the hydrophobic pocket to cover the active site of ABI1 like a plug.

Multiple distinct models involving chain assembly on E2 or substrate have been proposed. However, the speed and complexity of the reaction have precluded direct experimental tests to distinguish between potential pathways. Here we introduce new theoretical and experimental methodologies to address both limitations. A quantitative framework based on product distribution predicts that the really interesting new gene (RING) E3 enzymes SCF(Cdc4) and SCF(beta-TrCP) work with the E2 Cdc34 to build polyubiquitin chains on substrates by sequential transfers of single ubiquitins. Measurements with millisecond time resolution directly demonstrate that substrate polyubiquitylation proceeds sequentially. Our results present an unprecedented glimpse into the mechanism of RING ubiquitin ligases and illuminate the quantitative parameters that underlie the rate and pattern of ubiquitin chain assembly.","[Pierce, Nathan W.; Kleiger, Gary; Deshaies, Raymond J.] CALTECH, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Div Biol, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA; [Shan, Shu-ou] CALTECH, Div Chem & Chem Engn, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA","Deshaies, RJ (reprint author), CALTECH, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Div Biol, MC 156-29,1200 E Calif Blvd, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA.",deshaies@caltech.edu,"Deshaies, Raymond/B-8354-2014","Deshaies, Raymond/0000-0002-3671-9354",Gordon Ross Fellowship; National Institutes of Health [GM065997]; Howard Hughes Medical Institute,"We thank J.

Galactic 'microquasars', which are binary systems consisting of a neutron star or stellar-mass black hole accreting gas from a companion star, also produce relativistic jets, generally together with radio flares(2). Apart from an isolated event detected(3) in Cygnus X-1, there has hitherto been no systematic evidence for the acceleration of particles to gigaelectronvolt or higher energies in a microquasar, with the consequence that we are as yet unsure about the mechanism of jet energization. Here we report four gamma-ray flares with energies above 100 MeV from the microquasar Cygnus X-3 (an exceptional X-ray binary(4-6) that sporadically produces radio jets(7-9)). There is a clear pattern of temporal correlations between the c-ray flares and transitional spectral states of the radio-frequency and X-ray emission. Particle acceleration occurred a few days before radio-jet ejections for two of the four flares, meaning that the process of jet formation implies the production of very energetic particles. In Cygnus X-3, particle energies during the flares can be thousands of times higher than during quiescent states.","[Tavani, M.; Piano, G.; Evangelista, Y.; Trois, A.; Costa, E.; Vittorini, V.; Argan, A.; D'Ammando, F.; Del Monte, E.; De Paris, G.; Di Persio, G.; Donnarumma, I.; Feroci, M.; Lazzarotto, F.; Pacciani, L.; Rubini, A.; Scalise, E.; Soffitta, P.] INAF IASF Roma, I-00133 Rome, Italy; [Tavani, M.; Sabatini, S.; Striani, E.; Cocco, V.; D'Ammando, F.; Picozza, P.] Univ Roma Tor Vergata, Dipartimento Fis, I-00133 Rome, Italy; [Tavani, M.; Chen, A.

The core then gravitationally collapses to a neutron star or a black hole, leading to an explosion-an iron-core-collapse supernova(1,2). By contrast, extremely massive stars with M(initial) >= 140M(circle dot) (if such exist) develop oxygen cores with masses, M(core), that exceed 50M(circle dot), where high temperatures are reached at relatively low densities. Conversion of energetic, pressure-supporting photons into electron-positron pairs occurs before oxygen ignition and leads to a violent contraction which triggers a nuclear explosion(3-5) that unbinds the star in a pair-instability supernova. Transitional objects with 100M(circle dot) < M(initial) < 140M(circle dot) may end up as iron-core-collapse supernovae following violent mass ejections, perhaps as a result of brief episodes of pair instability, and may already have been identified(6-8). Here we report observations of supernova SN 2007bi, a luminous, slowly evolving object located within a dwarf galaxy. We estimate the exploding core mass to be M(core) approximate to 100M(circle dot), in which case theory unambiguously predicts a pair-instability supernova. We show that >3M(circle dot) of radioactive (56)Ni was synthesized during the explosion and that our observations are well fitted by models of pair-instability supernovae(9,10). This indicates that nearby dwarf galaxies probably host extremely massive stars, above the apparent Galactic stellar mass limit(11), which perhaps result from processes similar to those that created the first stars in the Universe.","[Gal-Yam, A.; Arcavi, I.] Weizmann Inst Sci, Fac Phys, Benoziyo Ctr Astrophys, IL-76100 Rehovot, Israel; [Mazzali, P.] Max Planck Inst Astrophys, D-85748 Garching, Germany; [Mazzali, P.] Scuola Normale Super Pisa, I-56127 Pisa, Italy; [Ofek, E.

However, the charge neutrality of these systems presents an apparent limitation-a wide range of intriguing phenomena arise from the Lorentz force for charged particles in a magnetic field, such as the fractional quantum Hall effect in two-dimensional electron systems(4,5). The limitation can be circumvented by exploiting the equivalence of the Lorentz force and the Coriolis force to create synthetic magnetic fields in rotating neutral systems. This was demonstrated by the appearance of quantized vortices in pioneering experiments(6-9) on rotating quantum gases, a hallmark of superfluids or superconductors in a magnetic field. However, because of technical issues limiting the maximum rotation velocity, the metastable nature of the rotating state and the difficulty of applying stable rotating optical lattices, rotational approaches are not able to reach the large fields required for quantum Hall physics(10-12). Here we experimentally realize an optically synthesized magnetic field for ultracold neutral atoms, which is evident from the appearance of vortices in our Bose-Einstein condensate. Our approach uses a spatially dependent optical coupling between internal states of the atoms, yielding a Berry's phase(13) sufficient to create large synthetic magnetic fields, and is not subject to the limitations of rotating systems. With a suitable lattice configuration, it should be possible to reach the quantum Hall regime, potentially enabling studies of topological quantum computation.","[Lin, Y. -J.; Compton, R.

Applications include the manipulation of living cells by optical tweezers(1) and optical cooling in atomic physics(2). The miniaturization of optical systems ( to the micro and nanoscale) has resulted in very compliant systems with masses of the order of nanograms, rendering them susceptible to optical forces(3-6). Optical forces have been exploited to demonstrate chaotic quivering of microcavities(7), optical cooling of mechanical modes(8-11), actuation of a tapered-fibre waveguide and excitation of the mechanical modes of silicon nano-beams(12,13). Despite recent progress in this field(14-17), it is challenging to manipulate the optical response of photonic structures using optical forces; this is because of the large forces that are required to induce appreciable changes in the geometry of the structure. Here we implement a resonant structure whose optical response can be efficiently statically controlled using relatively weak attractive and repulsive optical forces. We demonstrate a static mechanical deformation of up to 20 nanometres in a silicon nitride structure, using three milliwatts of continuous optical power. Because of the sensitivity of the optical response to this deformation, such optically induced static displacement introduces resonance shifts spanning 80 times the intrinsic resonance linewidth.","[Wiederhecker, Gustavo S.; Chen, Long; Gondarenko, Alexander; Lipson, Michal] Cornell Univ, Sch Elect & Comp Engn, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA","Lipson, M (reprint author), Cornell Univ, Sch Elect & Comp Engn, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",ml292@cornell.edu,"Wiederhecker, Gustavo/E-7456-2010","Wiederhecker, Gustavo/0000-0002-8216-6797",National Science Foundation [00446571]; Cornell University's Center for Nanoscale Systems; National Science Foundation; Cornell University and Industrial,"This work was supported in part by the National Science Foundation under grant 00446571.

Documenting the spatial and temporal variability of past climates is therefore critical for understanding how such forcings are translated into regional climate variability. In contrast to the data-richmiddle and high latitudes, high-quality climate-proxy records from equatorial regions are relatively few(2-4), especially from regions experiencing the bimodal seasonal rainfall distribution associated with twice-annual passage of the Intertropical Convergence Zone. Here we present a continuous and well-resolved climate-proxy record of hydrological variability during the past 25,000 years from equatorial East Africa. Our results, based on complementary evidence from seismic-reflection stratigraphy and organic biomarker molecules in the sediment record of Lake Challa near Mount Kilimanjaro, reveal that monsoon rainfall in this region varied at half-precessional (similar to 11,500-year) intervals in phase with orbitally controlled insolation forcing. The southeasterly and northeasterly monsoons that advect moisture from the western Indian Ocean were strengthened in alternation when the inter-hemispheric insolation gradient was at a maximum; dry conditions prevailed when neither monsoon was intensified and modest local March or September insolation weakened the rain season that followed. On sub-millennial timescales, the temporal pattern of hydrological change on the East African Equator bears clear high-northern-latitude signatures, but on the orbital timescale it mainly responded to low-latitude insolation forcing. Predominance of low-latitude climate processes in this monsoon region can be attributed to the low-latitude position of its continental regions of surface air flow convergence, and its relative isolation from the Atlantic Ocean, where prominent meridional overturning circulation more tightly couples low-latitude climate regimes to high-latitude boundary conditions.","[Verschuren, Dirk; Fagot, Maureen] Univ Ghent, Dept Biol, Limnol Unit, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium; [Damste, Jaap S.

Recently, the effect of stress on the slope (the b value) of the earthquake frequency-magnitude distribution was determined(3) by investigations of the faulting-style dependence of the b value. In a similar manner, we study here aftershock sequences according to the faulting style of their main shocks. We show that the time delay before the onset of the power-law aftershock decay rate ( the c value) is on average shorter for thrust main shocks than for normal fault earthquakes, taking intermediate values for strike-slip events. These similar dependences on the faulting style indicate that both of the fundamental power laws are governed by the state of stress. Focal mechanisms are known for only 2 per cent of aftershocks. Therefore, c and b values are independent estimates and can be used as new tools to infer the stress field, which remains difficult to measure directly.","[Narteau, Clement; Byrdina, Svetlana; Shebalin, Peter] Univ P7, UMR 7154, CNRS, Inst Phys Globe, F-75252 Paris 05, France; [Byrdina, Svetlana] Univ Savoie, IRD, CNRS, Lab Geophys Interne & Tectonophys,UMR 5559, F-73376 Le Bourget Du Lac, France; [Shebalin, Peter] Int Inst Earthquake Predict Theory & Math Geophys, Moscow 117997, Russia; [Schorlemmer, Danijel] Univ So Calif, Dept Earth Sci, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA","Narteau, C (reprint author), Univ P7, UMR 7154, CNRS, Inst Phys Globe, 4 Pl Jussieu, F-75252 Paris 05, France.",narteau@ipgp.jussieu.fr,"Narteau, Clement/C-6912-2011; Shebalin, Peter/G-6695-2011","Narteau, Clement/0000-0002-9556-9544; Shebalin, Peter/0000-0002-3361-3773",,,,29,56,57,2,21,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,3-Dec,2009,462,7273,,,,,642,U113,,10.1038/nature08553,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,526HH,WOS:000272277900039,19956258,No,,,11/20/17

These neuropeptides are inhibited in response to feeding-related signals and are released during fasting. However, the molecular mechanisms that regulate and integrate these signals remain poorly understood. Here we show that the forkhead box transcription factor Foxa2,a downstream target of insulin signalling(4-6), regulates the expression of orexin and MCH. During fasting, Foxa2 binds to MCH and orexin promoters and stimulates their expression. In fed and in hyperinsulinemic obese mice, insulin signalling leads to nuclear exclusion of Foxa2 and reduced expression of MCH and orexin. Constitutive activation of Foxa2 in the brain (Nes-Cre/1; Foxa2T156A(flox/flox) genotype) results in increased neuronal MCH and orexin expression and increased food consumption, metabolism and insulin sensitivity. Spontaneous physical activity of these animals in the fed state is significantly increased and is similar to that in fasted mice. Conditional activation of Foxa2 through the T156A mutation expression in the brain of obese mice also resulted in improved glucose homeostasis, decreased fat and increased lean body mass. Our results demonstrate that Foxa2 can act as a metabolic sensor in neurons of the lateral hypothalamic area to integrate metabolic signals, adaptive behaviour and physiological responses.","[Silva, Jose P.; Howell, Jessica; Stoffel, Markus] Rockefeller Univ, Lab Metab Dis, New York, NY 10021 USA; [von Meyenn, Ferdinand; Howell, Jessica; Wolfrum, Christian; Stoffel, Markus] ETH, Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Inst Mol Syst Biol, CH-8093 Zurich, Switzerland; [Thorens, Bernard] Univ Lausanne, Ctr Integrat Genom, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland","Stoffel, M (reprint author), Rockefeller Univ, Lab Metab Dis, 1230 York Ave, New York, NY 10021 USA.",stoffel@imsb.biol.ethz.ch,"von Meyenn, Ferdinand/O-4517-2017","von Meyenn, Ferdinand/0000-0001-9920-3075",SystemsX; Swiss National Science Foundation,This study was supported by grants from SystemsX and the Swiss National Science Foundation (LiverX grant).

Dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons transmit sensory information to the spinal cord using the excitatory transmitter glutamate(1), a process that depends on glutamate transport into synaptic vesicles for regulated exocytotic release. Here we report that a small subset of cells in the DRG expresses the low abundance vesicular glutamate transporter VGLUT3 (also known as SLC17A8). In the dorsal horn of the spinal cord, these afferents project to lamina I and the innermost layer of lamina II, which has previously been implicated in persistent pain caused by injury(2). Because the different VGLUT isoforms generally have a non-redundant pattern of expression(3), we used Vglut3 knockout mice to assess the role of VGLUT3(+) primary afferents in the behavioural response to somatosensory input. The loss of VGLUT3 specifically impairs mechanical pain sensation, and in particular the mechanical hypersensitivity to normally innocuous stimuli that accompanies inflammation, nerve injury and trauma. Direct recording from VGLUT3(+) neurons in the DRG further identifies them as a poorly understood population of unmyelinated, low threshold mechanoreceptors (C-LTMRs)(4,5). The analysis of Vglut3(-/-) mice now indicates a critical role for C-LTMRs in the mechanical hypersensitivity caused by injury.","[Seal, Rebecca P.; Edwards, Robert H.] Univ Calif San Francisco, San Francisco Sch Med, Dept Physiol, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; [Seal, Rebecca P.; Edwards, Robert H.] Univ Calif San Francisco, San Francisco Sch Med, Dept Neurol, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; [Wang, Xidao; Basbaum, Allan I.] Univ Calif San Francisco, San Francisco Sch Med, Dept Anat, San Francisco, CA 94158 USA; [Wang, Xidao; Basbaum, Allan I.] Univ Calif San Francisco, San Francisco Sch Med, Dept Physiol, San Francisco, CA 94158 USA; [Guan, Yun; Raja, Srinivasa N.] Johns Hopkins Univ, Sch Med, Dept Anesthesiol & Crit Care Med, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA; [Woodbury, C.

Bioinformatics searches(6-10) of genomic DNA from bacteria commonly identify new noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs)(10-12) such as riboswitches(13,14). In rare instances, RNAs that exhibit more extensive sequence and structural conservation across a wide range of bacteria are encountered(15,16). Given that large structured RNAs are known to carry out complex biochemical functions such as protein synthesis and RNA processing reactions, identifying more RNAs of great size and intricate structure is likely to reveal additional biochemical functions that can be achieved by RNA. We applied an updated computational pipeline(17) to discover ncRNAs that rival the known large ribozymes in size and structural complexity or that are among the most abundant RNAs in bacteria that encode them.

Several proteins have been reported to function as ABA receptors(8-13), and many more are known to be involved in ABA signalling(3,4,14). However, the identities of ABA receptors remain controversial and the mechanism of signalling from perception to downstream gene expression is unclear(15,16). Here we show that by combining the recently identified ABA receptor PYR1 with the type 2C protein phosphatase (PP2C) ABI1, the serine/threonine protein kinase SnRK2.6/OST1 and the transcription factor ABF2/AREB1, we can reconstitute ABA-triggered phosphorylation of the transcription factor in vitro. Introduction of these four components into plant protoplasts results in ABA-responsive gene expression. Protoplast and test-tube reconstitution assays were used to test the function of various members of the receptor, protein phosphatase and kinase families. Our results suggest that the default state of the SnRK2 kinases is an autophosphorylated, active state and that the SnRK2 kinases are kept inactive by the PP2Cs through physical interaction and dephosphorylation. We found that in the presence of ABA, the PYR/PYL (pyrabactin resistance 1/PYR1-like) receptor proteins can disrupt the interaction between the SnRK2s and PP2Cs, thus preventing the PP2C-mediated dephosphorylation of the SnRK2s and resulting in the activation of the SnRK2 kinases. Our results reveal new insights into ABA signalling mechanisms and define a minimal set of core components of a complete major ABA signalling pathway.","[Fujii, Hiroaki; Chinnusamy, Viswanathan; Park, Sang-Youl; Cutler, Sean R.; Zhu, Jian-Kang] Univ Calif Riverside, Dept Bot & Plant Sci, Riverside, CA 92521 USA; [Fujii, Hiroaki; Chinnusamy, Viswanathan; Zhu, Jian-Kang] 4700 King Abdullah Univ Sci & Technol, Ctr Plant Stress Genom & Technol, Thuwal 239556900, Saudi Arabia; [Rodrigues, Americo; Rubio, Silvia; Antoni, Regina; Rodriguez, Pedro L.] Univ Politecn Valencia, CSIC, Inst Biol Mol & Celular Plantas, ES-46022 Valencia, Spain; [Sheen, Jen] Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Dept Mol Biol, Boston, MA 02114 USA","Zhu, JK (reprint author), Univ Calif Riverside, Dept Bot & Plant Sci, Riverside, CA 92521 USA.",jian-kang.zhu@ucr.edu,"Chinnusamy, Viswanathan/B-9079-2009; Rodrigues, Americo/F-9573-2010; Cutler, Sean/D-6617-2011; Rodriguez, Pedro L./K-4605-2014; Zhu, Jian-Kang/F-7658-2011","Chinnusamy, Viswanathan/0000-0003-2174-9064; Rodrigues, Americo/0000-0002-5293-5583; Fujii, Hiroaki/0000-0002-0013-5891; Rodriguez, Pedro L./0000-0002-5886-9425; Zhu, Jian-Kang/0000-0001-5134-731X",National Institutes of Health; MICIIN; CSIC,We thank R.

Recently, a 14-member family of intracellular ABA receptors, named PYR/PYL/RCAR(1-3), has been identified. These proteins inhibit in an ABA-dependent manner the activity of a family of key negative regulators of the ABA signalling pathway: the group-A protein phosphatases type 2C (PP2Cs)(4-6). Here we present the crystal structure of Arabidopsis thaliana PYR1, which consists of a dimer in which one of the subunits is bound to ABA. In the ligand-bound subunit, the loops surrounding the entry to the binding cavity fold over the ABA molecule, enclosing it inside, whereas in the empty subunit they form a channel leaving an open access to the cavity, indicating that conformational changes in these loops have a critical role in the stabilization of the hormone-receptor complex. By providing structural details on the ABA-binding pocket, this work paves the way for the development of new small molecules able to activate the plant stress response.","[Dupeux, Florine; Round, Adam; Marquez, Jose Antonio] UJF, EMBL, CNRS, European Mol Biol Lab,Grenoble Outstn, F-38042 Grenoble 9, France; [Dupeux, Florine; Round, Adam; Marquez, Jose Antonio] UJF, EMBL, CNRS, Unit Virus Host Cell Interact, F-38042 Grenoble, France; [Santiago, Julia; Antoni, Regina; Luis Rodriguez, Pedro] Univ Politecn Valencia, CSIC, Inst Biol Mol & Celular Plantas, ES-46022 Valencia, Spain; [Park, Sang-Youl; Cutler, Sean R.] Univ Calif Riverside, Ctr Plant Cell Biol, Dept Bot & Plant Sci, Riverside, CA 92521 USA; [Jamin, Marc] Univ Grenoble 1, CNRS, EMBL, Virus Host Cell Interact UVHCI UMI 3265, F-38042 Grenoble 9, France","Marquez, JA (reprint author), UJF, EMBL, CNRS, European Mol Biol Lab,Grenoble Outstn, 6 Rue Jules Horowitz,BP181, F-38042 Grenoble 9, France.",marquez@embl.fr,"Rodriguez, Pedro L./K-4605-2014; Marquez, Jose/C-5826-2015; Cutler, Sean/D-6617-2011","Rodriguez, Pedro L./0000-0002-5886-9425; Santiago, Julia/0000-0002-5765-6495; Round, Adam/0000-0002-0723-8228; ",Ministerio de Educacion y Ciencia [BIO2008-00221]; Fondo Europeo de Desarrollo Regional; Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas; European Community-Research Infrastructure Action PCUBE,We thank A.

X-ray crystallography can provide snapshots of conformational substates sampled during enzymatic reactions(1), while NMR relaxation methods reveal the rates of interconversion between substates and the corresponding relative populations(1,2). However, these current methods cannot simultaneously reveal the detailed atomic structures of the rare states and rationalize the finding that intrinsic motions in the free enzyme occur on a timescale similar to the catalytic turnover rate. Here we introduce dual strategies of ambient-temperature X-ray crystallographic data collection and automated electron-density sampling to structurally unravel interconverting substates of the human proline isomerase, cyclophilin A (CYPA, also known as PPIA). A conservative mutation outside the active site was designed to stabilize features of the previously hidden minor conformation. This mutation not only inverts the equilibrium between the substates, but also causes large, parallel reductions in the conformational interconversion rates and the catalytic rate. These studies introduce crystallographic approaches to define functional minor protein conformations and, in combination with NMR analysis of the enzyme dynamics in solution, show how collective motions directly contribute to the catalytic power of an enzyme.","[Fraser, James S.; Degnan, Sheena C.; Erion, Renske; Alber, Tom] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mol & Cell Biol QB3, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Clarkson, Michael W.; Kern, Dorothee] Brandeis Univ, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Dept Biochem, Waltham, MA 02454 USA","Alber, T (reprint author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mol & Cell Biol QB3, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",dkern@brandeis.edu; tom@ucxray.berkeley.edu,,"Fraser, James/0000-0002-5080-2859",US NSF; Canadian NSERC; US National Institutes of Health; US Department of Energy Office of Basic Energy Sciences; Howard Hughes Medical Institute,"We thank S.

FocA forms a symmetric pentamer, with each protomer consisting of six transmembrane segments. Despite a lack of sequence homology, the overall structure of the FocA protomer closely resembles that of aquaporin and strongly argues that FocA is a channel, rather than a transporter. Structural analysis identifies potentially important channel residues, defines the channel path and reveals two constriction sites. Unlike aquaporin, FocA is impermeable to water but allows the passage of formate.

Here we use neutron diffraction, solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the structure and hydration of bilayer membranes containing S1-S4 voltage-sensing domains. Our results show that voltage sensors adopt transmembrane orientations and cause a modest reshaping of the surrounding lipid bilayer, and that water molecules intimately interact with the protein within the membrane. These structural findings indicate that voltage sensors have evolved to interact with the lipid membrane while keeping energetic and structural perturbations to a minimum, and that water penetrates the membrane, to hydrate charged residues and shape the transmembrane electric field.","[Mihailescu, Mihaela; Freites, J.

It contains several stellar populations having different heavy elemental abundances supplied by supernovae(5)-a process known as metal enrichment. Although M 22 appears to be similar to omega Cen(6), other peculiar globular clusters do not(7,8). Therefore omega Cen and M 22 are viewed as exceptional, and the presence of chemical inhomogeneities in other clusters is seen as 'pollution' from the intermediate-mass asymptotic-giant-branch stars expected in normal globular clusters(9). Here we report Ca abundances for seven globular clusters and compare them to omega Cen. Calcium and other heavy elements can only be supplied through numerous supernovae explosions of massive stars in these stellar systems(10), but the gravitational potentials of the present-day clusters cannot preserve most of the ejecta from such explosions(11).

Indeed, only one cluster-like system (omega Centauri) in the Galactic halo is known to have multiple stellar populations with a significant spread in iron abundance and age(4,5). Similar findings in the Galactic bulge have been hampered by the obscuration arising from thick and varying layers of interstellar dust. Here we report that Terzan 5, a globular-cluster-like system in the Galactic bulge, has two stellar populations with different iron contents and ages. Terzan 5 could be the surviving remnant of one of the primordial building blocks that are thought to merge and form galaxy bulges.","[Ferraro, F.

The realization of superconductivity in heavily doped diamond(5), silicon(6), silicon carbide(7) and germanium(8) suggests that Cooper pairs eventually may be directly incorporated in semiconductor heterostructures(9), but these newly discovered superconductors are currently limited by their extremely large electronic disorder. Similarly, the electron mean free path in low-dimensional superconducting thin films is usually limited by interface scattering, in single-crystal or polycrystalline samples, or atomic-scale disorder, in amorphous materials, confining these examples to the extreme 'dirty limit'(10). Here we report the fabrication of a high-quality superconducting layer within a thin-film heterostructure based on SrTiO(3) ( the first known superconducting semiconductor(11)). By selectively doping a narrow region of SrTiO(3) with the electron-donor niobium, we form a superconductor that is two-dimensional, as probed by the anisotropy of the upper critical magnetic field. Unlike in previous examples, however, the electron mobility is high enough that the normal state resistance exhibits Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations that scale with the perpendicular field, indicating two-dimensional states. These results suggest that delta-doped SrTiO(3) provides a model system in which to explore the quantum transport and interplay(12) of both superconducting and normal electrons. They also demonstrate that high-quality complex oxide heterostructures can maintain electron coherence on the macroscopic scales probed by transport, as well as on the microscopic scales demonstrated previously(13).","[Kozuka, Y.; Kim, M.; Bell, C.; Kim, B.

Such spin-based technologies may have a profound impact on nanoelectronics, data storage, and logic and computer architectures. Recently it has become possible to induce and detect spin polarization in otherwise non-magnetic semiconductors ( gallium arsenide and silicon) using all-electrical structures(3-9), but so far only at temperatures below 150 K and in n- type materials, which limits further development. Here we demonstrate room-temperature electrical injection of spin polarization into n-type and p-type silicon from a ferromagnetic tunnel contact, spin manipulation using the Hanle effect and the electrical detection of the induced spin accumulation. A spin splitting as large as 2.9 meV is created in n-type silicon, corresponding to an electron spin polarization of 4.6%. The extracted spin lifetime is greater than 140 ps for conduction electrons in heavily doped n- type silicon at 300 K and greater than 270 ps for holes in heavily doped p-type silicon at the same temperature. The spin diffusion length is greater than 230 nm for electrons and 310 nm for holes in the corresponding materials. These results open the way to the implementation of spin functionality in complementary silicon devices and electronic circuits operating at ambient temperature, and to the exploration of their prospects and the fundamental rules that govern their behaviour.","[Dash, Saroj P.; Sharma, Sandeep; Patel, Ram S.; de Jong, Michel P.; Jansen, Ron] Univ Twente, MESA Inst Nanotechnol, NL-7500 AE Enschede, Netherlands","Jansen, R (reprint author), Univ Twente, MESA Inst Nanotechnol, POB 217, NL-7500 AE Enschede, Netherlands.",ron.jansen@el.utwente.nl,"Dash, Saroj/G-5225-2010; Patel, Ram Shanker/E-7377-2010","Patel, Ram Shanker/0000-0003-3532-3961; Sharma, Sandeep/0000-0001-5475-1297",NWO-VIDI; Netherlands Foundation,This work was financially supported by the NWO-VIDI programme and the Netherlands Foundation for Fundamental Research on Matter.,,26,392,397,7,135,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,26-Nov,2009,462,7272,,,,,491,494,,10.1038/nature08570,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,524LG,WOS:000272144200040,19940922,No,Y,N,11/20/17

At present these waters provide the main source of heat and salt for the surface branch of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (MOC)(2). There is evidence from past glacial-to-interglacial variations in foraminiferal assemblages(3) and model studies(4) that the amount of Agulhas leakage and its corresponding effect on the MOC has been subject to substantial change, potentially linked to latitudinal shifts in the Southern Hemisphere westerlies(5). A progressive poleward migration of the westerlies has been observed during the past two to three decades and linked to anthropogenic forcing(6), but because of the sparse observational records it has not been possible to determine whether there has been a concomitant response of Agulhas leakage. Here we present the results of a high-resolution ocean general circulation model(7,8) to show that the transport of Indian Ocean waters into the South Atlantic via the Agulhas leakage has increased during the past decades in response to the change in wind forcing. The increased leakage has contributed to the observed salinification(9) of South Atlantic thermocline waters. Both model and historic measurements off South America suggest that the additional Indian Ocean waters have begun to invade the North Atlantic, with potential implications for the future evolution of the MOC.","[Biastoch, A.; Boening, C.

Between transform faults, seafloor spreading and rifting is well established in several basins. Other than hotspot-dominated Iceland, the Gulf of California is the only part of the world's seafloor-spreading system that has been surrounded by enough seismometers to provide horizontal resolution of upper-mantle structure at a scale of 100 kilometres over a distance great enough to include several spreading segments. Such resolution is needed to address the long-standing debate about the relative importance of dynamic and passive upwelling in the shallow mantle beneath spreading centres. Here we use Rayleigh-wave tomography to image the shear velocity in the upper 200 kilometres or so of the mantle. Low shear velocities similar to those beneath the East Pacific Rise oceanic spreading centre underlie the entire length of the Gulf, but there are three concentrated locations of anomalously low velocities spaced about 250 kilometres apart. These anomalies are 40 to 90 kilometres beneath the surface, at which depths petrological studies indicate that extensive melting of passively upwelling mantle should begin(2,3). We interpret these seismic velocity anomalies as indicating that partial melting triggers dynamic upwelling driven by either the buoyancy of retained melt or by the reduced density of depleted mantle.","[Wang, Yun; Forsyth, Donald W.] Brown Univ, Dept Geol Sci, Providence, RI 02912 USA; [Savage, Brian] Univ Rhode Isl, Dept Geosci, Kingston, RI 02881 USA","Wang, Y (reprint author), Brown Univ, Dept Geol Sci, Providence, RI 02912 USA.",yun_wang@brown.edu,,,National Science Foundation,This research was supported by the MARGINS programme of the National Science Foundation.,,28,52,52,0,15,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,26-Nov,2009,462,7272,,,,,499,U192,,10.1038/nature08552,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,524LG,WOS:000272144200042,19940924,No,,,11/20/17

This integration of information across auditory and visual streams has been observed in functional imaging studies(3,4), and has typically been attributed to the frequency and robustness with which perceivers jointly encounter event-specific information from these two modalities(5). Adding the tactile modality has long been considered a crucial next step in understanding multisensory integration. However, previous studies have found an influence of tactile input on speech perception only under limited circumstances, either where perceivers were aware of the task(6,7) or where they had received training to establish a cross-modal mapping(8-10). Here we show that perceivers integrate naturalistic tactile information during auditory speech perception without previous training. Drawing on the observation that some speech sounds produce tiny bursts of aspiration (such as English 'p')(11), we applied slight, inaudible air puffs on participants' skin at one of two locations: the right hand or the neck. Syllables heard simultaneously with cutaneous air puffs were more likely to be heard as aspirated ( for example, causing participants to mishear 'b' as 'p'). These results demonstrate that perceivers integrate event-relevant tactile information in auditory perception in much the same way as they do visual information.","[Gick, Bryan; Derrick, Donald] Univ British Columbia, Dept Linguist, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada; [Gick, Bryan] Haskins Labs Inc, New Haven, CT 06511 USA","Gick, B (reprint author), Univ British Columbia, Dept Linguist, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada.",gick@interchange.ubc.ca,,,Natural Sciences and Engineering Council of Canada; National Institutes of Health [DC-02717],"This research was funded by a Discovery Grant from the Natural Sciences and Engineering Council of Canada to B.

RANKL and RANK are also expressed in the central nervous system(5,6). However, the functional relevance of RANKL/RANK in the brain was entirely unknown. Here we report that RANKL and RANK have an essential role in the brain. In both mice and rats, central RANKL injections trigger severe fever. Using tissue-specific Nestin-Cre and GFAP-Cre rank(floxed) deleter mice, the function of RANK in the fever response was genetically mapped to astrocytes. Importantly, Nestin-Cre and GFAP-Cre rank(floxed) deleter mice are resistant to lipopolysaccharide-induced fever as well as fever in response to the key inflammatory cytokines IL-1 beta and TNF alpha. Mechanistically, RANKL activates brain regions involved in thermoregulation and induces fever via the COX2-PGE(2)/EP3R pathway. Moreover, female Nestin-Cre and GFAP-Cre rank(floxed) mice exhibit increased basal body temperatures, suggesting that RANKL and RANK control thermoregulation during normal female physiology. We also show that two children with RANK mutations exhibit impaired fever during pneumonia. These data identify an entirely novel and unexpected function for the key osteoclast differentiation factors RANKL/RANK in female thermoregulation and the central fever response in inflammation.","[Hanada, Reiko; Leibbrandt, Andreas; Hanada, Toshikatsu; Trichereau, Jean; Paolino, Magdalena; Komnenovic, Vukoslav; Penninger, Josef M.] Austrian Acad Sci, Inst Mol Biotechnol, IMBA, A-1030 Vienna, Austria; [Kitaoka, Shiho; Furuyashiki, Tomoyuki; Narumiya, Shuh] Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Med, Dept Pharmacol, Kyoto 6068501, Japan; [Fujihara, Hiroaki; Ueta, Yoichi] Univ Occupat & Environm Hlth, Sch Med, Dept Physiol, Kitakyushu, Fukuoka 8078555, Japan; [Qadri, Fatimunnisa; Plehm, Ralph; Bader, Michael] Max Delbruck Ctr Mol Med, D-13125 Berlin, Germany; [Klaere, Steffen; von Haeseler, Arndt] Ctr Integrated Bioinformat, Max F Perutz Labs, A-1030 Vienna, Austria; [Mimata, Hiromitsu; Yoshimatsu, Hironobu] Oita Univ, Fac Med, Oita 8795593, Japan; [Takahashi, Naoyuki] Matsumoto Dent Univ, Inst Oral Sci, Nagano 3990781, Japan; [Kilic, Sara Sebnem] Uludag Univ, Fac Med, TR-16059 Bursa, Turkey; [Pifl, Christian] Med Univ Vienna, Ctr Brain Res, A-1090 Vienna, Austria","Penninger, JM (reprint author), Austrian Acad Sci, Inst Mol Biotechnol, IMBA, A-1030 Vienna, Austria.",josef.penninger@imba.oeaw.ac.at,"Klaere, Steffen/B-4202-2013; Penninger, Josef/I-6860-2013; Furuyashiki, Tomoyuki/B-8760-2014","Klaere, Steffen/0000-0002-4570-6109; Penninger, Josef/0000-0002-8194-3777; Furuyashiki, Tomoyuki/0000-0001-8089-8399; Bader, Michael/0000-0003-4780-4164","UEHARA Foundation; Japan Foundation for Applied Enzymology; Austrian Ministry for Science and Research; Wiener Wissenschafts-, Forschungs- und Technologiefonds (WWTF); IMBA; Austrian Ministry of Sciences; Austrian Academy of Sciences; GEN-AU ( AustroMouse); EU Marie Curie Excellence; EU ERC","We thank C.

NifV, which encodes homocitrate synthase (HCS)(3), has been identified from various diazotrophs but is not present in most rhizobial species that perform efficient nitrogen fixation only in symbiotic association with legumes. Here we show that the FEN1 gene of a model legume, Lotus japonicus, overcomes the lack of NifV in rhizobia for symbiotic nitrogen fixation. A Fix(-) (non-fixing) plant mutant, fen1, forms morphologically normal but ineffective nodules(4,5). The causal gene, FEN1, was shown to encode HCS by its ability to complement a HCS-defective mutant of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Homocitrate was present abundantly in wild-type nodules but was absent from ineffective fen1 nodules. Inoculation with Mesorhizobium loti carrying FEN1 or Azotobacter vinelandii NifV rescued the defect in nitrogen-fixing activity of the fen1 nodules. Exogenous supply of homocitrate also recovered the nitrogen-fixing activity of the fen1 nodules through de novo nitrogenase synthesis in the rhizobial bacteroids. These results indicate that homocitrate derived from the host plant cells is essential for the efficient and continuing synthesis of the nitrogenase system in endosymbionts, and thus provide a molecular basis for the complementary and indispensable partnership between legumes and rhizobia in symbiotic nitrogen fixation.","[Hakoyama, Tsuneo; Niimi, Kaori; Watanabe, Hirokazu; Tabata, Ryohei; Matsubara, Junichi; Suganuma, Norio] Aichi Univ Educ, Dept Life Sci, Aichi 4488542, Japan; [Hakoyama, Tsuneo; Yano, Koji; Imaizumi-Anraku, Haruko; Kouchi, Hiroshi] Natl Inst Agrobiol Sci, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058602, Japan; [Sato, Shusei; Nakamura, Yasukazu; Tabata, Satoshi] Kazusa DNA Res Inst, Chiba 2920812, Japan; [Li Jichun; Matsumoto, Tsuyoshi; Tatsumi, Kazuyuki] Nagoya Univ, Grad Sch Sci, Dept Chem, Aichi 4648602, Japan; [Li Jichun; Matsumoto, Tsuyoshi; Tatsumi, Kazuyuki] Nagoya Univ, Res Ctr Mat Sci, Aichi 4648602, Japan; [Nomura, Mika; Tajima, Shigeyuki] Kagawa Univ, Fac Agr, Kita Ku, Kagawa 7610795, Japan; [Ishizaka, Masumi] Natl Inst Agroenvironm Sci, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058604, Japan; [Kawaguchi, Masayoshi] Natl Inst Nat Sci, Natl Inst Basic Biol, Okazaki, Aichi 4448585, Japan","Suganuma, N (reprint author), Aichi Univ Educ, Dept Life Sci, Aichi 4488542, Japan.",nsuganum@auecc.aichi-edu.ac.jp,"Matsumoto, Tsuyoshi/E-8638-2013; Sato, Shusei/A-3616-2015","Sato, Shusei/0000-0002-0293-5366; Nakamura, Yasukazu/0000-0002-6782-5715","Japanese Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology","We thank E.

The excess absorption of light energy by photosynthetic pigments has led to the evolution of protective mechanisms that operate on the timescale of seconds to minutes and involve feedback-regulated de-excitation of chlorophyll molecules in photosystem II (qE). Despite the significant contribution of eukaryotic algae to global primary production(1), little is known about their qE mechanism, in contrast to that in flowering plants(2,3). Here we show that a qE-deficient mutant of the unicellular green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, npq4, lacks two of the three genes encoding LHCSR (formerly called LI818). This protein is an ancient member of the light-harvesting complex superfamily, and orthologues are found throughout photosynthetic eukaryote taxa(4), except in red algae and vascular plants. The qE capacity of Chlamydomonas is dependent on environmental conditions and is inducible by growth under high light conditions. We show that the fitness of the npq4 mutant in a shifting light environment is reduced compared to wild-type cells, demonstrating that LHCSR is required for survival in a dynamic light environment. Thus, these data indicate that plants and algae use different proteins to dissipate harmful excess light energy and protect the photosynthetic apparatus from damage.","[Peers, Graham; Truong, Thuy B.; Niyogi, Krishna K.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Plant & Microbial Biol, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Truong, Thuy B.; Niyogi, Krishna K.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Lawrence Berkeley Lab, Phys Biosci Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Ostendorf, Elisabeth; Busch, Andreas; Hippler, Michael] Univ Munster, Inst Plant Biochem & Biotechnol, D-48143 Munster, Germany; [Elrad, Dafna; Grossman, Arthur R.] Carnegie Inst, Dept Plant Biol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA","Niyogi, KK (reprint author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Plant & Microbial Biol, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",mhippler@uni-muenster.de; niyogi@berkeley.edu,,,"Chemical Sciences, Geosciences and Biosciences Division, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Office of Science, US Department of Energy; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft; National Science Foundation","We thank M.

Purified aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases exhibit a fidelity of one error per 10,000 to 100,000 couplings(1,2). The accuracy of tRNA aminoacylation in vivo is uncertain, however, and might be considerably lower(3-6). Here we show that in mammalian cells, approximately 1% of methionine (Met) residues used in protein synthesis are aminoacylated to non-methionyl-tRNAs. Remarkably, Met-misacylation increases up to tenfold upon exposing cells to live or non-infectious viruses, toll-like receptor ligands or chemically induced oxidative stress. Met is misacylated to specific non-methionyl-tRNA families, and these Met-misacylated tRNAs are used in translation. Met-misacylation is blocked by an inhibitor of cellular oxidases, implicating reactive oxygen species (ROS) as the misacylation trigger. Among six amino acids tested, tRNA misacylation occurs exclusively with Met. As Met residues are known to protect proteins against ROS-mediated damage(7), we propose that Met-misacylation functions adaptively to increase Met incorporation into proteins to protect cells against oxidative stress. In demonstrating an unexpected conditional aspect of decoding mRNA, our findings illustrate the importance of considering alternative iterations of the genetic code.","[Netzer, Nir; David, Alexandre; Gibbs, James S.; Embry, Alan; Dolan, Brian; Das, Suman; Hickman, Heather D.; Berglund, Peter; Bennink, Jack R.; Yewdell, Jonathan W.] NIAID, Viral Dis Lab, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Goodenbour, Jeffrey M.] Univ Chicago, Dept Human Genet, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Dittmar, Kimberly A.; Pan, Tao] Univ Chicago, Dept Biochem & Mol Biol, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Jones, Richard B.; Eves, Eva M.; Rosner, Marsha R.] Univ Chicago, Ben May Inst, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Schneider, Jeffrey R.; Boone, David] Univ Chicago, Dept Med, Chicago, IL 60637 USA","Yewdell, JW (reprint author), NIAID, Viral Dis Lab, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA.",jyewdell@nih.gov; taopan@uchicago.edu,"yewdell, jyewdell@nih.gov/A-1702-2012; Das, Suman/C-8760-2009; David, Alexandre/B-2447-2013","David, Alexandre/0000-0003-3365-1339",Division of Intramural Research; National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases; National Institutes of Health,"The authors are grateful to D.

Here we present the first genome-wide, single-base-resolution maps of methylated cytosines in a mammalian genome, from both human embryonic stem cells and fetal fibroblasts, along with comparative analysis of messenger RNA and small RNA components of the transcriptome, several histone modifications, and sites of DNA-protein interaction for several key regulatory factors. Widespread differences were identified in the composition and patterning of cytosine methylation between the two genomes. Nearly one-quarter of all methylation identified in embryonic stem cells was in a non-CG context, suggesting that embryonic stem cells may use different methylation mechanisms to affect gene regulation. Methylation in non-CG contexts showed enrichment in gene bodies and depletion in protein binding sites and enhancers. Non-CG methylation disappeared upon induced differentiation of the embryonic stem cells, and was restored in induced pluripotent stem cells. We identified hundreds of differentially methylated regions proximal to genes involved in pluripotency and differentiation, and widespread reduced methylation levels in fibroblasts associated with lower transcriptional activity. These reference epigenomes provide a foundation for future studies exploring this key epigenetic modification in human disease and development.","[Lister, Ryan; Pelizzola, Mattia; Dowen, Robert H.; Nery, Joseph R.; Ecker, Joseph R.] Salk Inst Biol Studies, Genom Anal Lab, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; [Hawkins, R.

While special relativity assumes that there is no fundamental length-scale associated with such invariance, there is a fundamental scale (the Planck scale, l(Planck) approximate to 1.62 x 10(-33) cm or E-Planck = M(Planck)c(2) approximate to 1.22 x 10(19) GeV), at which quantum effects are expected to strongly affect the nature of space-time. There is great interest in the (not yet validated) idea that Lorentz invariance might break near the Planck scale. A key test of such violation of Lorentz invariance is a possible variation of photon speed with energy(1-7). Even a tiny variation in photon speed, when accumulated over cosmological light-travel times, may be revealed by observing sharp features in gamma-ray burst (GRB) light-curves(2). Here we report the detection of emission up to similar to 31GeV from the distant and short GRB090510. We find no evidence for the violation of Lorentz invariance, and place a lower limit of 1.2E(Planck) on the scale of a linear energy dependence (or an inverse wavelength dependence), subject to reasonable assumptions about the emission (equivalently we have an upper limit of l(Planck)/1.2 on the length scale of the effect). Our results disfavour quantum-gravity theories(3,6,7) in which the quantum nature of space-time on a very small scale linearly alters the speed of light.","[Granot, J.] Univ Hertfordshire, Ctr Astrophys Res, Hatfield AL10 9AB, Herts, England; [Abdo, A.

This is all the more puzzling because Fermi pockets (small closed Fermi surface features) have been suggested by recent quantum oscillation measurements(9-14). The Fermi arcs cannot be understood in terms of existing theories, although there is a solution in the form of conventional Fermi surface pockets associated with competing order, but with a back side that is for detailed reasons invisible to photoemission probes(15). Here we report ARPES measurements of Bi2Sr2-xLaxCuO6+delta (La-Bi2201) that reveal Fermi pockets. The charge carriers in the pockets are holes, and the pockets show an unusual dependence on doping: they exist in underdoped but not overdoped samples. A surprise is that these Fermi pockets appear to coexist with the Fermi arcs. This coexistence has not been expected theoretically.","[Meng, Jianqiao; Liu, Guodong; Zhang, Wentao; Zhao, Lin; Liu, Haiyun; Jia, Xiaowen; Mu, Daixiang; Liu, Shanyu; Dong, Xiaoli; Zhang, Jun; Lu, Wei; Zhou, X.

Much of the research on graphene has been directed towards exploration of its novel electronic properties, but the structural aspects of this model two-dimensional system are also of great interest and importance. In particular, microscopic corrugations have been observed on all suspended(2) and supported(3-8) graphene sheets studied so far. This rippling has been invoked to explain the thermodynamic stability of free-standing graphene sheets(9). Many distinctive electronic(10-12) and chemical(13-15) properties of graphene have been attributed to the presence of ripples, which are also predicted to give rise to new physical phenomena(16-26) that would be absent in a planar two-dimensional material. Direct experimental study of such novel ripple physics has, however, been hindered by the lack of flat graphene layers. Here we demonstrate the fabrication of graphene monolayers that are flat down to the atomic level. These samples are produced by deposition on the atomically flat terraces of cleaved mica surfaces. The apparent height variation in the graphene layers observed by high-resolution atomic force microscopy (AFM) is less than 25 picometres, indicating the suppression of any existing intrinsic ripples in graphene. The availability of such ultraflat samples will permit rigorous testing of the impact of ripples on various physical and chemical properties of graphene.","[Lui, Chun Hung; Mak, Kin Fai; Heinz, Tony F.] Columbia Univ, Dept Phys, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Lui, Chun Hung; Mak, Kin Fai; Heinz, Tony F.] Columbia Univ, Dept Elect Engn, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Liu, Li; Flynn, George W.] Columbia Univ, Dept Chem, New York, NY 10027 USA","Heinz, TF (reprint author), Columbia Univ, Dept Phys, 538 W 120th St, New York, NY 10027 USA.",tony.heinz@columbia.edu,"Liu, Li/E-8959-2013; Heinz, Tony/K-7797-2015","Liu, Li/0000-0002-4852-1580; Heinz, Tony/0000-0003-1365-9464",DARPA; Nano Electronics Research Corporation (NERC) through the INDEX Center; National Science Foundation [CHE-07-01483]; US Department of Energy [DE-FG02-88-ER13937],"We thank E.

The relationship between the D/H ratio of mean annual precipitation and mean annual surface air temperature is said to be uniform +/- 10% over East Antarctica(3) and constant with time +/- 20% (refs 3-5). In the absence of strong independent temperature proxy evidence allowing us to calibrate individual ice cores, prior general circulation model (GCM) studies have supported the assumption of constant uniform conversion for climates cooler than that of the present day(3,5). Here we analyse the three available 340 kyr East Antarctic ice core records alongside input from GCM modelling. We show that for warmer interglacial periods the relationship between temperature and the isotopic signature varies among ice core sites, and that therefore the conversions must be nonlinear for at least some sites. Model results indicate that the isotopic composition of East Antarctic ice is less sensitive to temperature changes during warmer climates. We conclude that previous temperature estimates from interglacial climates are likely to be too low.

The ocean plays a crucial role in mitigating the effects of this perturbation to the climate system, sequestering 20 to 35 per cent of anthropogenic CO2 emissions(2-4). Although much progress has been made in recent years in understanding and quantifying this sink, considerable uncertainties remain as to the distribution of anthropogenic CO2 in the ocean, its rate of uptake over the industrial era, and the relative roles of the ocean and terrestrial biosphere in anthropogenic CO2 sequestration. Here we address these questions by presenting an observationally based reconstruction of the spatially resolved, time-dependent history of anthropogenic carbon in the ocean over the industrial era. Our approach is based on the recognition that the transport of tracers in the ocean can be described by a Green's function, which we estimate from tracer data using a maximum entropy deconvolution technique. Our results indicate that ocean uptake of anthropogenic CO2 has increased sharply since the 1950s, with a small decline in the rate of increase in the last few decades. We estimate the inventory and uptake rate of anthropogenic CO2 in 2008 at 140 +/- 25 Pg C and 2.3 +/- 0.6 Pg C yr(-1), respectively. We find that the Southern Ocean is the primary conduit by which this CO2 enters the ocean (contributing over 40 per cent of the anthropogenic CO2 inventory in the ocean in 2008). Our results also suggest that the terrestrial biosphere was a source of CO2 until the 1940s, subsequently turning into a sink. Taken over the entire industrial period, and accounting for uncertainties, we estimate that the terrestrial biosphere has been anywhere from neutral to a net source of CO2, contributing up to half as muchCO(2) as has been taken up by the ocean over the same period.","[Khatiwala, S.] Columbia Univ, Lamont Doherty Earth Observ, Palisades, NY 10964 USA; [Primeau, F.] Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Earth Syst Sci, Irvine, CA 92697 USA; [Hall, T.] NASA, Goddard Inst Space Studies, New York, NY 10025 USA","Khatiwala, S (reprint author), Columbia Univ, Lamont Doherty Earth Observ, Palisades, NY 10964 USA.",spk@ldeo.columbia.edu,"Primeau, Francois /A-7310-2011","Primeau, Francois /0000-0001-7452-9415","US NSF [OCE 06-23366, OCE 07-26871]",This work was supported by US NSF grants OCE 06-23366 (to S.

For many species, the primary obstacle to the evolution of outcrossing is the cost of production of males(1), individuals that do not directly contribute offspring and thus diminish the long-term reproductive output of a lineage. Self-fertilizing ('selfing') organisms do not incur the cost of males and therefore should possess at least a twofold numerical advantage over most outcrossing organisms(2). Two competing explanations for the widespread prevalence of outcrossing in nature despite this inherent disadvantage are the avoidance of inbreeding depression generated by selfing(3-5) and the ability of outcrossing populations to adapt more rapidly to environmental change(1,6,7). Here we show that outcrossing is favoured in populations of Caenorhabditis elegans subject to experimental evolution both under conditions of increased mutation rate and during adaptation to a novel environment. In general, fitness increased with increasing rates of outcrossing. Thus, each of the standard explanations for the maintenance of outcrossing are correct, and it is likely that outcrossing is the predominant mode of reproduction inmost species because it is favoured under ecological conditions that are ubiquitous in natural environments.","[Morran, Levi T.; Parmenter, Michelle D.; Phillips, Patrick C.] 5289 Univ Oregon, Ctr Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Eugene, OR 97403 USA","Phillips, PC (reprint author), 5289 Univ Oregon, Ctr Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Eugene, OR 97403 USA.",pphil@uoregon.edu,,"Phillips, Patrick/0000-0001-7271-342X","NSF [DEB-0236180, DEB-0710386, DEB-0641066]; NIH","Acknowledgements We thank S.

This 'binding' mechanism requires that spatially distributed cells fire together with millisecond range precision(7,8); however, it is not clear how such coordinated timing is achieved given that the frequency of gamma oscillations varies substantially across space and time, from similar to 25 to almost 150 Hz(1,9-13). Here we show that gamma oscillations in the CA1 area of the hippocampus split into distinct fast and slow frequency components that differentially couple CA1 to inputs from the medial entorhinal cortex, an area that provides information about the animal's current position(14-17), and CA3, a hippocampal subfield essential for storage of such information(14,18,19). Fast gamma oscillations in CA1 were synchronized with fast gamma in medial entorhinal cortex, and slow gamma oscillations in CA1 were coherent with slow gamma in CA3. Significant proportions of cells in medial entorhinal cortex and CA3 were phase-locked to fast and slow CA1 gamma waves, respectively. The two types of gamma occurred at different phases of the CA1 theta rhythm and mostly on different theta cycles. These results point to routeing of information as a possible function of gamma frequency variations in the brain and provide a mechanism for temporal segregation of potentially interfering information from different sources.","[Colgin, Laura Lee; Denninger, Tobias; Fyhn, Marianne; Hafting, Torkel; Bonnevie, Tora; Moser, May-Britt; Moser, Edvard I.] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Kavli Inst Syst Neurosci, NO-7489 Trondheim, Norway; [Colgin, Laura Lee; Denninger, Tobias; Fyhn, Marianne; Hafting, Torkel; Bonnevie, Tora; Moser, May-Britt; Moser, Edvard I.] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Ctr Biol Memory, MTFS, NO-7489 Trondheim, Norway; [Jensen, Ole] Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Donders Inst Brain Cognit & Behav, NL-6500 HB Nijmegen, Netherlands","Colgin, LL (reprint author), Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Kavli Inst Syst Neurosci, Olav Kyrres Gate 9, NO-7489 Trondheim, Norway.",laura.colgin@ntnu.no; edvard.moser@ntnu.no,"Jensen, Ole/D-2120-2010","Jensen, Ole/0000-0001-8193-8348; Hafting, Torkel/0000-0002-0928-3487",Kavli Foundation; Norwegian Research Council,"We thank A.

It is unclear how these different molecular regulatory mechanisms interact to regulate changes in stem cell fate. Here we present a dynamic systems-level study of cell fate change in murine ESCs following a well-defined perturbation. Global changes in histone acetylation, chromatin-bound RNA polymerase II, messenger RNA (mRNA), and nuclear protein levels were measured over 5 days after downregulation of Nanog, a key pluripotency regulator(13-15). Our data demonstrate how a single genetic perturbation leads to progressive widespread changes in several molecular regulatory layers, and provide a dynamic view of information flow in the epigenome, transcriptome and proteome. We observe that a large proportion of changes in nuclear protein levels are not accompanied by concordant changes in the expression of corresponding mRNAs, indicating important roles for translational and post-translational regulation of ESC fate. Gene-ontology analysis across different molecular layers indicates that although chromatin reconfiguration is important for altering cell fate, it is preceded by transcription-factor- mediated regulatory events. The temporal order of gene expression alterations shows the order of the regulatory network reconfiguration and offers further insight into the gene regulatory network. Our studies extend the conventional systems biology approach to include many molecular species, regulatory layers and temporal series, and underscore the complexity of the multi-layer regulatory mechanisms responsible for changes in protein expression that determine stem cell fate.","[Lu, Rong; Lemischka, Ihor R.] Princeton Univ, Dept Mol Biol, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Markowetz, Florian; Airoldi, Edoardo M.; Troyanskaya, Olga G.] Princeton Univ, Lewis Sigler Inst Integrat Genom, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Markowetz, Florian; Airoldi, Edoardo M.; Troyanskaya, Olga G.] Princeton Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Unwin, Richard D.; Whetton, Anthony D.] Univ Manchester, Wolfson Mol Imaging Ctr,Sch Canc & Imaging Sci, Manchester Acad Hlth Sci Ctr, Stem Cell & Leukaemia Prote Lab, Manchester M20 4QL, Lancs, England; [Leek, Jeffrey T.; MacArthur, Ben D.; Rozov, Roye; Lemischka, Ihor R.] Mt Sinai Sch Med, Dept Gene & Cell Med, New York, NY 10029 USA; [Leek, Jeffrey T.; MacArthur, Ben D.; Rozov, Roye; Lemischka, Ihor R.] Mt Sinai Sch Med, Black Family Stem Cell Inst, New York, NY 10029 USA; [MacArthur, Ben D.; Lachmann, Alexander; Ma'ayan, Avi] Mt Sinai Sch Med, Dept Pharmacol & Syst Therapeut, New York, NY 10029 USA; [MacArthur, Ben D.; Lachmann, Alexander; Ma'ayan, Avi] Mt Sinai Sch Med, Syst Biol Ctr New York, New York, NY 10029 USA; [Boyer, Laurie A.] MIT, Dept Biol, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA","Lemischka, IR (reprint author), Princeton Univ, Dept Mol Biol, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA.",rlu@stanford.edu; ihor.lemischka@mssm.edu,"Airoldi, Edoardo/A-8575-2009; Unwin, Richard/C-1258-2008","Unwin, Richard/0000-0001-7955-9111; MacArthur, Ben/0000-0002-5396-9750; Airoldi, Edoardo/0000-0002-3512-0542; Leek, Jeffrey/0000-0002-2873-2671; WHETTON, ANTHONY/0000-0002-1098-3878; Markowetz, Florian/0000-0002-2784-5308; Lachmann, Alexander/0000-0002-1982-7652",NIH; BBSRC; Leukaemia Research UK; US National Science Foundation,"We would like to thank D.

The main bacterial translocase comprises the SecYEG protein-conducting channel and the peripheral ATPase motor SecA(2,3). Most proteins destined for the periplasm and beyond are exported post-translationally by SecA(2,3). Preprotein targeting to SecA is thought to involve signal peptides(4) and chaperones like SecB(5,6). Here we show that signal peptides have a new role beyond targeting: they are essential allosteric activators of the translocase. On docking on their binding groove on SecA, signal peptides act in trans to drive three successive states: first, 'triggering' that drives the translocase to a lower activation energy state; second, 'trapping' that engages non-native preprotein mature domains docked with high affinity on the secretion apparatus; and third, 'secretion' during which trapped mature domains undergo several turnovers of translocation in segments(7). A significant contribution by mature domains renders signal peptides less critical in bacterial secretory protein targeting than currently assumed. Rather, it is their function as allosteric activators of the translocase that renders signal peptides essential for protein secretion. A role for signal peptides and targeting sequences as allosteric activators may be universal in protein translocases.","[Gouridis, Giorgos; Karamanou, Spyridoula; Economou, Anastassios] Fdn Res & Technol Hellas, Inst Mol Biol & Biotechnol, Iraklion 71110, Crete, Greece; [Gouridis, Giorgos; Economou, Anastassios] Univ Crete, Dept Biol, Iraklion 71409, Crete, Greece; [Gelis, Ioannis; Kalodimos, Charalampos G.] Rutgers State Univ, Piscataway, NJ 08854 USA","Economou, A (reprint author), Fdn Res & Technol Hellas, Inst Mol Biol & Biotechnol, Iraklion 71110, Crete, Greece.",aeconomo@imbb.forth.gr,"Economou, Anastassios/P-8292-2017","Economou, Anastassios/0000-0002-1770-507X",European Community [LSHC-CT-2006-037834/Streptomics]; Greek General Secretariat of Research and the European Regional Development Fund [PENED03ED623]; US National Institutes of Health [GM73854]; American Heart Association; Onassis Foundation,"Acknowledgements We are grateful to G.

Allosteric proteins can exist in several conformational states with distinct binding or enzymatic activity. Effectors are considered to function in a purely structural manner by selectively stabilizing a specific conformational state, thereby regulating protein activity. Here we show that allosteric proteins can be regulated predominantly by changes in their structural dynamics. We have used NMR spectroscopy and isothermal titration calorimetry to characterize cyclic AMP (cAMP) binding to the catabolite activator protein (CAP), a transcriptional activator that has been a prototype for understanding effector-mediated allosteric control of protein activity(7). cAMP switches CAP from the 'off' state (inactive), which binds DNA weakly and non-specifically, to the 'on' state (active), which binds DNA strongly and specifically. In contrast, cAMP binding to a single CAP mutant, CAP-S62F, fails to elicit the active conformation; yet, cAMP binding to CAP-S62F strongly activates the protein for DNA binding. NMR and thermodynamic analyses show that despite the fact that CAP-S62F-cAMP(2) adopts the inactive conformation, its strong binding to DNA is driven by a large conformational entropy originating in enhanced protein motions induced by DNA binding. The results provide strong evidence that changes in protein motions may activate allosteric proteins that are otherwise structurally inactive.","[Tzeng, Shiou-Ru; Kalodimos, Charalampos G.] Rutgers State Univ, Dept Chem & Chem Biol, Piscataway, NJ 08854 USA; [Tzeng, Shiou-Ru; Kalodimos, Charalampos G.] Rutgers State Univ, Dept Biomed Engn, Piscataway, NJ 08854 USA","Kalodimos, CG (reprint author), Rutgers State Univ, Dept Chem & Chem Biol, Piscataway, NJ 08854 USA.",babis@rutgers.edu,,,National Science Foundation (NSF) [MCB618259],We are grateful to L.

In general, these proteins lack surface involutions suitable for high-affinity binding by small molecules. Here we report the design of synthetic, cell-permeable, stabilized alpha-helical peptides that target a critical protein-protein interface in the NOTCH transactivation complex. We demonstrate that direct, high-affinity binding of the hydrocarbon-stapled peptide SAHM1 prevents assembly of the active transcriptional complex. Inappropriate NOTCH activation is directly implicated in the pathogenesis of several disease states, including T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (T-ALL). The treatment of leukaemic cells with SAHM1 results in genome-wide suppression of NOTCH-activated genes. Direct antagonism of the NOTCH transcriptional program causes potent, NOTCH-specific anti-proliferative effects in cultured cells and in a mouse model of NOTCH1-driven T-ALL.","[Moellering, Raymond E.; Bradner, James E.] Broad Inst Harvard & MIT, Chem Biol Program, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; [Moellering, Raymond E.; Verdine, Gregory L.] Harvard Univ, Dept Chem & Biol Chem, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Moellering, Raymond E.; Verdine, Gregory L.; Bradner, James E.] Dana Farber Canc Inst, Program Canc Chem Biol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Cornejo, Melanie; Gilliland, D.

Here we report Li abundances for an unbiased sample of solar-analogue stars with and without detected planets. We find that the planet-bearing stars have less than one per cent of the primordial Li abundance, while about 50 per cent of the solar analogues without detected planets have on average ten times more Li.

The first experimental evidence of the two-dimensional nature of graphene came from the observation of a sequence of plateaus in measurements of its transport properties in the presence of an applied magnetic field(1,2). These are signatures of the so-called integer quantum Hall effect. However, as a consequence of the relativistic character of the charge carriers, the integer quantum Hall effect observed in graphene is qualitatively different from its semiconductor analogue(3). As a third distinguishing feature of graphene, it has been conjectured that interactions and correlations should be important in this material, but surprisingly, evidence of collective behaviour in graphene is lacking. In particular, the quintessential collective quantum behaviour in two dimensions, the fractional quantum Hall effect (FQHE), has so far resisted observation in graphene despite intense efforts and theoretical predictions of its existence(4-9). Here we report the observation of the FQHE in graphene. Our observations are made possible by using suspended graphene devices probed by two-terminal charge transport measurements(10). This allows us to isolate the sample from substrate-induced perturbations that usually obscure the effects of interactions in this system and to avoid effects of finite geometry. At low carrier density, we find a field-induced transition to an insulator that competes with the FQHE, allowing its observation only in the highest quality samples. We believe that these results will open the door to the physics of FQHE and other collective behaviour in graphene.","[Du, Xu; Skachko, Ivan; Duerr, Fabian; Luican, Adina; Andrei, Eva Y.] Rutgers State Univ, Dept Phys & Astron, Piscataway, NJ 08855 USA","Andrei, EY (reprint author), Rutgers State Univ, Dept Phys & Astron, POB 849, Piscataway, NJ 08855 USA.",eandrei@physics.rutgers.edu,,, [DE-FG02-99ER45742];  [NSF-DMR-045673],"Work was supported by DE-FG02-99ER45742 and partially supported by NSF-DMR-045673.

In this strong quantum regime, electrons and magnetic flux quanta bind to form complex composite quasiparticles with fractional electronic charge; these are manifest in transport measurements of the Hall conductivity as rational fractions of the elementary conductance quantum. The experimental discovery of an anomalous integer quantum Hall effect in graphene has enabled the study of a correlated two-dimensional electronic system, in which the interacting electrons behave like massless chiral fermions(3,4). However, owing to the prevailing disorder, graphene has so far exhibited only weak signatures of correlated electron phenomena(5,6), despite intense experimental and theoretical efforts(7-14). Here we report the observation of the fractional quantum Hall effect in ultraclean, suspended graphene. In addition, we show that at low carrier density graphene becomes an insulator with a magnetic-field-tunable energy gap. These newly discovered quantum states offer the opportunity to study correlated Dirac fermions in graphene in the presence of large magnetic fields.","[Bolotin, Kirill I.; Ghahari, Fereshte; Stormer, Horst L.; Kim, Philip] Columbia Univ, Dept Phys, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Shulman, Michael D.; Stormer, Horst L.; Kim, Philip] Columbia Univ, Dept Appl Phys & Appl Math, New York, NY 10027 USA","Kim, P (reprint author), Columbia Univ, Dept Phys, 538 W 120th St, New York, NY 10027 USA.",pk2015@columbia.edu,"Kim, Philip/N-1886-2013; Bolotin, Kirill/O-5101-2016",,Microsoft Project Q; DARPA; Department of Energy (DOE),"We thank D.

For simple chemical systems, it has been possible to map out in considerable detail the reactive potential-energy surfaces describing atomic motions and resultant reaction dynamics(1), but such studies remain challenging for complex chemical and biological transformations(2). A case in point is the green fluorescent protein (GFP)(3-5) from the jellyfish Aequorea victoria, which is a widely used gene expression marker owing to its efficient bioluminescence. This feature is known to arise from excited-state proton transfer (ESPT)(6-8), yet the atomistic details of the process are still not fully understood. Here we show that femtosecond stimulated Raman spectroscopy(9,10) provides sufficiently detailed and time-resolved vibrational spectra of the electronically excited chromophore of GFP to reveal skeletal motions involved in the proton transfer that produces the fluorescent form of the protein. In particular, we observe that the frequencies and intensities of two marker bands, the C-O and C=N stretching modes at opposite ends of the conjugated chromophore, oscillate out of phase with a period of 280 fs; we attribute these oscillations to impulsively excited low-frequency phenoxyl-ring motions, which optimize the geometry of the chromophore for ESPT. Our findings illustrate that femtosecond simulated Raman spectroscopy is a powerful approach to revealing the real-time nuclear dynamics that make up a multidimensional polyatomic reaction coordinate.","[Fang, Chong; Frontiera, Renee R.; Tran, Rosalie; Mathies, Richard A.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Chem, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA","Mathies, RA (reprint author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Chem, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",ramathies@berkeley.edu,"Fang, Chong/D-3681-2009; Frontiera, Renee/D-8131-2011","Frontiera, Renee/0000-0001-8218-7574; Fang, Chong/0000-0002-8879-1825",Mathies Royalty Fund,Plasmids were provided by R.

But, because of uncertainty in the delta(18)O of the primitive ocean, there is considerable debate regarding this conclusion. Examination of modern and ancient cherts indicates that another approach, using a combined analysis of delta(18)O and hydrogen isotopes (delta D) rather than delta(18)O alone, can provide a firmer constraint on formational temperatures without independent knowledge of the isotopic composition of ambient waters(4,5). Here we show that delta(18)O and delta D sampled from 3.42-billion-year-old Buck Reef Chert rocks in South Africa are consistent with formation from waters at varied low temperatures. The most (18)O-enriched Buck Reef Chert rocks record the lowest diagenetic temperatures and were formed in equilibrium with waters below similar to 40 degrees C. Geochemical and sedimentary evidence suggests that the Buck Reef Chert was formed in shallow to deep marine conditions, so our results indicate that the Palaeoarchaean ocean was isotopically depleted relative to the modern ocean and far cooler (<= 40 degrees) than previously thought(2).","[Hren, M.

The timescale for segregation and transport of these melts, which are ultimately responsible for formation of the Earth's crust, is critically dependent on the permeability of the partly molten asthenospheric mantle, yet this permeability is known mainly from semi-empirical and analogue models(1-6). Here we use a high-pressure, high-temperature centrifuge, at accelerations of 400g-700g, to measure the rate of basalt melt flow in olivine aggregates with porosities of 5-12 per cent. The resulting permeabilities are consistent with a microscopic model in which melt is completely connected, and are one to two orders of magnitude larger than predicted by current parameterizations(4,7). Extrapolation of the measurements to conditions characteristic(8) of asthenosphere below mid-ocean ridges yields proportionally higher transport speeds. Application of these results in a model(9) of porous-media channelling instabilities(10) yields melt transport times of similar to 1-2.5 kyr across the entire asthenosphere, which is sufficient to preserve the observed Th-230 excess of mid-ocean-ridge basalts and the mantle signatures of even shorter-lived isotopes such as Ra-226 (refs 5,11-14).","[Connolly, James A.

So far, the transcription factor FOXP2 (forkhead box P2) is the only gene implicated in Mendelian forms of human speech and language dysfunction(1-3). It has been proposed that the amino acid composition in the human variant of FOXP2 has undergone accelerated evolution, and this two-amino-acid change occurred around the time of language emergence in humans(4,5). However, this remains controversial, and whether the acquisition of these amino acids in human FOXP2 has any functional consequence in human neurons remains untested. Here we demonstrate that these two human-specific amino acids alter FOXP2 function by conferring differential transcriptional regulation in vitro. We extend these observations in vivo to human and chimpanzee brain, and use network analysis to identify novel relationships among the differentially expressed genes. These data provide experimental support for the functional relevance of changes in FOXP2 that occur on the human lineage, highlighting specific pathways with direct consequences for human brain development and disease in the central nervous system (CNS). Because FOXP2 has an important role in speech and language in humans, the identified targets may have a critical function in the development and evolution of language circuitry in humans.","[Konopka, Genevieve; Bomar, Jamee M.; Winden, Kellen; Geschwind, Daniel H.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Program Neurogenet, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Geschwind, Daniel H.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Semel Inst, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Geschwind, Daniel H.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Psychiat, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Konopka, Genevieve; Bomar, Jamee M.; Winden, Kellen; Coppola, Giovanni; Gao, Fuying; Peng, Sophia; Geschwind, Daniel H.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Neurol, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Geschwind, Daniel H.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Human Genet, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Wohlschlegel, James A.; Geschwind, Daniel H.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Biol Chem, David Geffen Sch Med, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Preuss, Todd M.] Emory Univ, Sch Med, Div Neurosci, Atlanta, GA 30329 USA; [Preuss, Todd M.] Emory Univ, Sch Med, Ctr Behav Neurosci, Yerkes Natl Primate Res Ctr, Atlanta, GA 30329 USA; [Preuss, Todd M.] Emory Univ, Sch Med, Dept Pathol & Lab Med, Atlanta, GA 30329 USA","Konopka, G (reprint author), Univ Calif Los Angeles, Program Neurogenet, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.",gena@alum.mit.edu; dhg@ucla.edu,"Jonsson, Zophonias/E-1960-2015","Konopka, Genevieve/0000-0002-3363-7302",A.

Here we report an intracellular analysis of ocular dominance plasticity-the loss of acuity and cortical responsiveness for an eye deprived of vision in early life2,3. Unlike the typical progressive loss of pyramidal-cell bias, direct recording from fast-spiking cells in vivo reveals a counterintuitive initial shift towards the occluded eye followed by a late preference for the open eye, consistent with a spike-timing-dependent plasticity rule for these inhibitory neurons. Intracellular pharmacology confirms a dynamic switch of GABA (c-aminobutyric acid) impact to pyramidal cells following deprivation in juvenile mice only.

Yet, it has not been possible to examine the unique developmental genetics of human germ-cell formation and differentiation owing to inaccessibility of germ cells during fetal development. Although several studies have shown that germ cells can be differentiated from mouse and human embryonic stem cells, human germ cells differentiated in these studies generally did not develop beyond the earliest stages(1-8). Here we used a germ-cell reporter to quantify and isolate primordial germ cells derived from both male and female human embryonic stem cells. By silencing and overexpressing genes that encode germ-cell-specific cytoplasmic RNA-binding proteins (not transcription factors), we modulated human germ-cell formation and developmental progression. We observed that human DAZL (deleted in azoospermia-like) functions in primordial germ cell formation, whereas closely related genes DAZ and BOULE (also called BOLL) promote later stages of meiosis and development of haploid gametes. These results are significant to the generation of gametes for future basic science and potential clinical applications.","[Kee, Kehkooi; Angeles, Vanessa T.; Flores, Martha; Nguyen, Ha Nam; Pera, Renee A.

To evoke the mucosal immune response, antigens on the mucosal surface must be transported across the epithelial barrier into organized lymphoid structures such as Peyer's patches(4). This function, called antigen transcytosis, is mediated by specialized epithelial M cells(5,6). The molecular mechanisms promoting this antigen uptake, however, are largely unknown. Here we report that glycoprotein 2 (GP2), specifically expressed on the apical plasma membrane of M cells among enterocytes, serves as a transcytotic receptor for mucosal antigens. Recombinant GP2 protein selectively bound a subset of commensal and pathogenic enterobacteria, including Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (S. Typhimurium), by recognizing FimH, a component of type I pili on the bacterial outer membrane. Consistently, these bacteria were colocalized with endogenous GP2 on the apical plasma membrane as well as in cytoplasmic vesicles in M cells. Moreover, deficiency of bacterial FimH or host GP2 led to defects in transcytosis of type-I-piliated bacteria through M cells, resulting in an attenuation of antigen-specific immune responses in Peyer's patches. GP2 is therefore a previously unrecognized transcytotic receptor on M cells for type-I-piliated bacteria and is a prerequisite for the mucosal immune response to these bacteria. Given that M cells are considered a promising target for oral vaccination against various infectious diseases(7,8), the GP2-dependent transcytotic pathway could provide a new target for the development of M-cell-targeted mucosal vaccines.","[Hase, Koji; Kawano, Kazuya; Fukuda, Shinji; Ebisawa, Masashi; Kadokura, Kazunori; Fujimura, Yumiko; Kawano, Sayaka; Nakato, Gaku; Kimura, Shunsuke; Murakami, Takaya; Ohno, Hiroshi] RIKEN, Res Ctr Allergy & Immunol, Lab Epithelial Immunobiol, Kanagawa 2300045, Japan; [Nochi, Tomonori; Pontes, Gemilson Soares; Kiyono, Hiroshi] Univ Tokyo, Inst Med Sci, Dept Microbiol & Immunol, Tokyo 1088639, Japan; [Fukuda, Shinji; Ebisawa, Masashi; Kadokura, Kazunori; Nakato, Gaku; Ohno, Hiroshi] Yokohama City Univ, Int Grad Sch Bionanosci, Kanagawa 2300045, Japan; [Tobe, Toru] Osaka Univ, Grad Sch Med, Suita, Osaka 5650871, Japan; [Yabashi, Atsuko; Waguri, Satoshi] Fukushima Med Univ, Sch Med, Dept Anat & Histol, Fukushima 9601295, Japan; [Iimura, Mitsutoshi; Hamura, Kimiyo] Tokyo Womens Med Univ, Inst Gastroenterol, Tokyo 1628666, Japan; [Fukuoka, Shin-Ichi] Aoyama Gakuin Univ, Coll Sci & Engn, Dept Chem & Biol Sci, Kanagawa 2298558, Japan; [Lowe, Anson W.] Stanford Univ, Dept Med, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Lowe, Anson W.] Stanford Univ, Ctr Digest Dis, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Itoh, Kikuji] Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Agr & Life Sci, Tokyo 1138657, Japan","Ohno, H (reprint author), RIKEN, Res Ctr Allergy & Immunol, Lab Epithelial Immunobiol, Kanagawa 2300045, Japan.",ohno@rcai.riken.jp,"Kimura, Shunsuke/D-7093-2012; Ohno, Hiroshi/L-7899-2014","Kimura, Shunsuke/0000-0001-9408-2884; Ohno, Hiroshi/0000-0001-8776-9661","Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology of Japan; Takeda Science Foundation; NIH [DK56339, DK43294]","We thank K.

In contrast, replication forks must traverse such cohesin-associated obstructions to duplicate the entire genome in S phase. How this occurs is unknown. Through single-molecule analysis, we demonstrate that the replication factor C (RFC)-CTF18 clamp loader (RFC(CTF18))(1,7) controls the velocity, spacing and restart activity of replication forks in human cells and is required for robust acetylation of cohesin's SMC3 subunit and sister chromatid cohesion. Unexpectedly, we discovered that cohesin acetylation itself is a central determinant of fork processivity, as slow-moving replication forks were found in cells lacking the Eco1-related acetyltransferases ESCO1 or ESCO2 (refs 8 -10) (including those derived from Roberts' syndrome patients, in whom ESCO2 is biallelically mutated(11)) and in cells expressing a form of SMC3 that cannot be acetylated. This defect was a consequence of cohesin's hyperstable interaction with two regulatory cofactors, WAPL and PDS5A (refs 12, 13); removal of either cofactor allowed forks to progress rapidly without ESCO1, ESCO2, or RFC(CTF18). Our results show a novel mechanism for clamp-loader-dependent fork progression, mediated by the post-translational modification and structural remodelling of the cohesin ring. Loss of this regulatory mechanism leads to the spontaneous accrual of DNA damage and may contribute to the abnormalities of the Roberts' syndrome cohesinopathy.","[Terret, Marie-Emilie; Sherwood, Rebecca; Rahman, Sadia; Jallepalli, Prasad V.] Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Program Mol Biol, New York, NY 10065 USA; [Qin, Jun] Baylor Coll Med, Dept Biochem & Mol Biol, Ctr Mol Discovery, Houston, TX 77030 USA","Jallepalli, PV (reprint author), Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Program Mol Biol, 1275 York Ave, New York, NY 10065 USA.",jallepap@mskcc.org,"TERRET, Marie-Emilie/R-5782-2017","TERRET, Marie-Emilie/0000-0001-5843-925X",National Institutes of Health; Pew Scholar in the Biochemical Sciences award,"We thank D.

Many transcription factors bind to regulatory DNA elements distant from gene promoters. Although distal binding sites have been shown to regulate transcription by long-range chromatin interactions at a few loci, chromatin interactions and their impact on transcription regulation have not been investigated in a genome-wide manner. Here we describe the development of a new strategy, chromatin interaction analysis by paired-end tag sequencing (ChIA-PET) for the de novo detection of global chromatin interactions, with which we have comprehensively mapped the chromatin interaction network bound by oestrogen receptor alpha (ER-alpha) in the human genome. We found that most high-confidence remote ER-alpha-binding sites are anchored at gene promoters through long-range chromatin interactions, suggesting that ER-alpha functions by extensive chromatin looping to bring genes together for coordinated transcriptional regulation.

We generated a high-resolution atlas of cis-regulatory modules describing their temporal and combinatorial occupancy during Drosophila mesoderm development. The binding profiles of cis-regulatory modules with characterized expression were used to train support vector machines to predict five spatio-temporal expression patterns.

If there is accretion after neutron-star formation, the atmosphere could be composed of light elements (H or He); if no accretion takes place or if thermonuclear reactions occur after accretion, heavy elements (for example, Fe) are expected. Despite detailed searches, observations have been unable to confirm the atmospheric composition of isolated neutron stars(1). Here we report an analysis of archival observations of the compact X-ray source in the centre of the Cassiopeia A supernova remnant. We show that a carbon atmosphere neutron star (with low magnetic field) produces a good fit to the spectrum. Our emission model, in contrast with others(2-4), implies an emission size consistent with theoretical predictions for the radius of neutron stars. This result suggests that there is nuclear burning in the surface layers(5,6) and also identifies the compact source as a very young (similar to 330-year-old) neutron star.","[Ho, Wynn C.

One approach is to use macroscopic, effectively thermodynamic ensembles of ultracold atoms to create quantum gases and strongly correlated states of matter, and to analyse the bulk properties of the ensemble. For example, bosonic and fermionic atoms in a Hubbard-regime optical lattice(1-5) can be used for quantum simulations of solid-state models(6). The opposite approach is to build up microscopic quantum systems atom-by-atom, with complete control over all degrees of freedom(7-9). The atoms or ions act as qubits and allow the realization of quantum gates, with the goal of creating highly controllable quantum information systems. Until now, the macroscopic and microscopic strategies have been fairly disconnected. Here we present a quantum gas 'microscope' that bridges the two approaches, realizing a system in which atoms of a macroscopic ensemble are detected individually and a complete set of degrees of freedom for each of them is determined through preparation and measurement. By implementing a high-resolution optical imaging system, single atoms are detected with near-unity fidelity on individual sites of a Hubbard-regime optical lattice. The lattice itself is generated by projecting a holographic mask through the imaging system.

Applied to the propagation of light, periodicity gives rise to photonic crystals(1), which can be precisely engineered for such applications as guiding and dispersing optical beams(2,3), tightly confining and trapping light resonantly(4), and enhancing nonlinear optical interactions(5). Photonic crystals can also be formed into planar lightwave circuits for the integration of optical and electrical microsystems(6). In a photonic crystal, the periodicity of the host medium is used to manipulate the properties of light, whereas a phononic crystal uses periodicity to manipulate mechanical vibrations(7-13). As has been demonstrated in studies of Raman-like scattering in epitaxially grown vertical cavity structures(14) and photonic crystal fibres(15), the simultaneous confinement of mechanical and optical modes in periodic structures can lead to greatly enhanced light-matter interactions. A logical next step is thus to create planar circuits that act as both photonic and phononic crystals(16): optomechanical crystals. Here we describe the design, fabrication and characterization of a planar, silicon-chip-based optomechanical crystal capable of co-localizing and strongly coupling 200-terahertz photons and 2-gigahertz phonons. These planar optomechanical crystals bring the powerful techniques of optics and photonic crystals to bear on phononic crystals, providing exquisitely sensitive (near quantum-limited), optical measurements of mechanical vibrations, while simultaneously providing strong nonlinear interactions for optics in a large and technologically relevant range of frequencies.","[Eichenfield, Matt; Chan, Jasper; Camacho, Ryan M.; Vahala, Kerry J.; Painter, Oskar] CALTECH, Thomas J Watson Sr Lab Appl Phys, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA","Painter, O (reprint author), CALTECH, Thomas J Watson Sr Lab Appl Phys, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA.",opainter@caltech.edu,"Camacho, Ryan/B-1841-2010; Chan, Jasper/E-6801-2011","Camacho, Ryan/0000-0001-9644-1422; Painter, Oskar/0000-0002-1581-9209","DARPA [HR0011-08-0002]; National Science Foundation [0622246, DMR-0520565, EEC-0812072]","Funding for this work was provided by a DARPA seed grant (grant no.

For hard-sphere colloids, which interact only as a result of excluded volume, phase behaviour is controlled by volume fraction, phi; an increase in phi drives the system towards its glassy state, analogously to a decrease in temperature, T, in molecular systems. When phi increases above phi* approximate to 0.53, the viscosity starts to increase significantly, and the system eventually moves out of equilibrium at the glass transition, phi(g) approximate to 0.58, where particle crowding greatly restricts structural relaxation(1-4). The large particle size makes it possible to study both structure and dynamics with light scattering(1) and imaging(3,4); colloidal suspensions have therefore provided considerable insight into the glass transition. However, hard-sphere colloidal suspensions do not exhibit the same diversity of behaviour as molecular glasses. This is highlighted by the wide variation in behaviour observed for the viscosity or structural relaxation time, tau(alpha), when the glassy state is approached in supercooled molecular liquids(5). This variation is characterized by the unifying concept of fragility(5), which has spurred the search for a 'universal' description of dynamic arrest in glass-forming liquids. For 'fragile' liquids, tau(alpha) is highly sensitive to changes in T, whereas non-fragile, or 'strong', liquids show a much lower T sensitivity. In contrast, hard-sphere colloidal suspensions are restricted to fragile behaviour, as determined by their phi dependence(1,6), ultimately limiting their utility in the study of the glass transition. Here we show that deformable colloidal particles, when studied through their concentration dependence at fixed temperature, do exhibit the same variation in fragility as that observed in the T dependence of molecular liquids at fixed volume. Their fragility is dictated by elastic properties on the scale of individual colloidal particles. Furthermore, we find an equivalent effect in molecular systems, where elasticity directly reflects fragility. Colloidal suspensions may thus provide new insight into glass formation in molecular systems.","[Mattsson, Johan; Wyss, Hans M.; Fernandez-Nieves, Alberto; Weitz, David A.] Harvard Univ, Harvard Sch Engn & Appl Sci, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Miyazaki, Kunimasa; Reichman, David R.] Columbia Univ, Dept Chem, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Hu, Zhibing] Univ N Texas, Dept Phys, Denton, TX 76203 USA; [Mattsson, Johan; Wyss, Hans M.; Fernandez-Nieves, Alberto; Weitz, David A.] Harvard Univ, Dept Phys, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA","Mattsson, J (reprint author), Chalmers, Dept Appl Phys, SE-41296 Gothenburg, Sweden.",johanm@chalmers.se,"Miyazaki, Kunimasa/C-3956-2009; Wyss, Hans/A-9404-2008; Wyss, Hans/B-7894-2010","Wyss, Hans/0000-0001-6564-3398; ",US National Science Foundation; Harvard University's Materials Research Science and Engineering Center; Hans Werthen Foundation; Wenner-Gren Foundation; Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation; Royal Society of Arts and Sciences in Goteborg; Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovacion; University of Almeria; KAKENHI,"We are grateful to J.

Plate tectonics gives no insight, however, into where and when earthquakes will occur within plates, because the interiors of ideal plates should not deform. As a result, within plate interiors, assessments of earthquake hazards rely heavily on the assumption that the locations of small earthquakes shown by the short historical record reflect continuing deformation that will cause future large earthquakes(1). Here, however, we show that many of these recent earthquakes are probably aftershocks of large earthquakes that occurred hundreds of years ago. We present a simple model predicting that the length of aftershock sequences varies inversely with the rate at which faults are loaded. Aftershock sequences within the slowly deforming continents are predicted to be significantly longer than the decade typically observed at rapidly loaded plate boundaries. These predictions are in accord with observations. So the common practice of treating continental earthquakes as steady-state seismicity overestimates the hazard in presently active areas and underestimates it elsewhere.","[Stein, Seth] Northwestern Univ, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, Evanston, IL 60208 USA; [Liu, Mian] Univ Missouri, Dept Geol Sci, Columbia, MO 65211 USA","Stein, S (reprint author), Northwestern Univ, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, Evanston, IL 60208 USA.",seth@earth.northwestern.edu,,,NSF/OISE [0730154]; Chinese Academy of Sciences,"We thank Y.

Although bet hedging is found in organisms ranging from bacteria to humans(4-10), direct evidence for an adaptive origin of this behaviour is lacking(11). Here we report the de novo evolution of bet hedging in experimental bacterial populations. Bacteria were subjected to an environment that continually favoured new phenotypic states. Initially, our regime drove the successive evolution of novel phenotypes by mutation and selection; however, in two (of 12) replicates this trend was broken by the evolution of bet-hedging genotypes that persisted because of rapid stochastic phenotype switching. Genome re-sequencing of one of these switching types revealed nine mutations that distinguished it from the ancestor. The final mutation was both necessary and sufficient for rapid phenotype switching; nonetheless, the evolution of bet hedging was contingent upon earlier mutations that altered the relative fitness effect of the final mutation. These findings capture the adaptive evolution of bet hedging in the simplest of organisms, and suggest that risk-spreading strategies may have been among the earliest evolutionary solutions to life in fluctuating environments.","[Beaumont, Hubertus J.

Despite this seemingly absolute seclusion, central nervous system tissues are subject to immune surveillance and are vulnerable to autoimmune attacks(1). Using intravital two-photon imaging in a Lewis rat model of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, here we present in real-time the interactive processes between effector T cells and cerebral structures from their first arrival to manifest autoimmune disease. We observed that incoming effector T cells successively scanned three planes. The T cells got arrested to leptomeningeal vessels and immediately monitored the luminal surface, crawling preferentially against the blood flow. After diapedesis, the cells continued their scan on the abluminal vascular surface and the underlying leptomeningeal (pial) membrane. There, the T cells encountered phagocytes that effectively present antigens, foreign as well as myelin proteins. These contacts stimulated the effector T cells to produce pro-inflammatory mediators, and provided a trigger to tissue invasion and the formation of inflammatory infiltrations.","[Bartholomaeus, Ingo; Kawakami, Naoto; Odoardi, Francesca; Schlaeger, Christian; Miljkovic, Djordje; Klinkert, Wolfgang E.

However, it remains unknown whether a mechanism exists that integrates these nucleic-acid-sensing systems. Here we show that high-mobility group box (HMGB) proteins 1, 2 and 3 function as universal sentinels for nucleic acids. HMGBs bind to all immunogenic nucleic acids examined with a correlation between affinity and immunogenic potential. Hmgb1(-/-) and Hmgb2(-/-) mouse cells are defective in type-I interferon and inflammatory cytokine induction by DNA or RNA targeted to activate the cytosolic nucleic-acid-sensing receptors; cells in which the expression of all three HMGBs is suppressed show a more profound defect, accompanied by impaired activation of the transcription factors interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) and nuclear factor (NF)-kappa B. The absence of HMGBs also severely impairs the activation of TLR3, TLR7 and TLR9 by their cognate nucleic acids. Our results therefore indicate a hierarchy in the nucleic-acid-mediated activation of immune responses, wherein the selective activation of nucleic-acid-sensing receptors is contingent on the more promiscuous sensing of nucleic acids by HMGBs. These findings may have implications for understanding the evolution of the innate immune system and for the treatment of immunological disorders.","[Yanai, Hideyuki; Ban, Tatsuma; Wang, ZhiChao; Choi, Myoung Kwon; Negishi, Hideo; Nakasato, Makoto; Lu, Yan; Hangai, Sho; Koshiba, Ryuji; Savitsky, David; Honda, Kenya; Tamura, Tomohiko; Taniguchi, Tadatsugu] Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Med, Dept Immunol, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo 1130033, Japan; [Yanai, Hideyuki; Ban, Tatsuma; Wang, ZhiChao; Choi, Myoung Kwon; Negishi, Hideo; Nakasato, Makoto; Lu, Yan; Hangai, Sho; Koshiba, Ryuji; Savitsky, David; Honda, Kenya; Tamura, Tomohiko; Taniguchi, Tadatsugu] Univ Tokyo, Fac Med, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo 1130033, Japan; [Kawamura, Takeshi; Kodama, Tatsuhiko] Univ Tokyo, RCAST, Lab Syst Biol & Med, Meguro Ku, Tokyo 1538904, Japan; [Ronfani, Lorenza; Bianchi, Marco E.] San Raffaele Univ, Fac Med, I-20132 Milan, Italy; [Akira, Shizuo] Osaka Univ, WPI Immunol Frontier Res Ctr, Host Def Lab, Suita, Osaka 5650871, Japan","Taniguchi, T (reprint author), Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Med, Dept Immunol, Bunkyo Ku, Hongo 7-3-1, Tokyo 1130033, Japan.",tada@m.u-tokyo.ac.jp,"Akira, Shizuo/C-3134-2009; Honda, Kenya/N-5297-2015","Bianchi, Marco Emilio/0000-0002-5329-6445","Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology of Japan; Korea Science and Engineering Foundation; Japan Society for the Promotion of Science","We thank C.

They have also been implicated in cellular transformation and tumorigenesis(2-6). However, despite extensive biochemical characterization of NF-kappa B signalling during the past twenty years, the requirement for NF-kappa B in tumour development in vivo, particularly in solid tumours, is not completely understood. Here we show that the NF-kappa B pathway is required for the development of tumours in a mouse model of lung adenocarcinoma. Concomitant loss of p53 (also known as Trp53) and expression of oncogenic Kras(G12D) resulted in NF-kappa B activation in primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts. Conversely, in lung tumour cell lines expressing Kras(G12D) and lacking p53, p53 restoration led to NF-kappa B inhibition. Furthermore, the inhibition of NF-kappa B signalling induced apoptosis in p53-null lung cancer cell lines. Inhibition of the pathway in lung tumours in vivo, from the time of tumour initiation or after tumour progression, resulted in significantly reduced tumour development. Together, these results indicate a critical function for NF-kappa B signalling in lung tumour development and, further, that this requirement depends on p53 status. These findings also provide support for the development of NF-kappa B inhibitory drugs as targeted therapies for the treatment of patients with defined mutations in Kras and p53.","[Meylan, Etienne; Dooley, Alison L.; Feldser, David M.; Shen, Lynn; Turk, Erin; Ouyang, Chensi; Jacks, Tyler] MIT, Koch Inst Integrat Canc Res, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Meylan, Etienne; Dooley, Alison L.; Feldser, David M.; Shen, Lynn; Turk, Erin; Ouyang, Chensi; Jacks, Tyler] MIT, Dept Biol, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Meylan, Etienne; Dooley, Alison L.; Feldser, David M.; Shen, Lynn; Turk, Erin; Ouyang, Chensi; Jacks, Tyler] MIT, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA","Jacks, T (reprint author), MIT, Koch Inst Integrat Canc Res, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",tjacks@mit.edu,,"Meylan, Etienne/0000-0002-0899-2230",Howard Hughes Medical Institute; NCI [P30-CA14051]; International Human Frontier Science Program Organization; Swiss National Science Foundation; Leukemia & Lymphoma Society Fellow Award,"We thank D.

Although the identification of specific oncogenes has led to the development of clinically effective, molecularly targeted therapies in some cases, KRAS has remained refractory to this approach. A complementary strategy for targeting KRAS is to identify gene products that, when inhibited, result in cell death only in the presence of an oncogenic allele(1,2). Here we have used systematic RNA interference to detect synthetic lethal partners of oncogenic KRAS and found that the non-canonical I kappa B kinase TBK1 was selectively essential in cells that contain mutant KRAS. Suppression of TBK1 induced apoptosis specifically in human cancer cell lines that depend on oncogenic KRAS expression. In these cells, TBK1 activated NF-kappa B anti-apoptotic signals involving c-Rel and BCL-XL (also known as BCL2L1) that were essential for survival, providing mechanistic insights into this synthetic lethal interaction. These observations indicate that TBK1 and NF-kappa B signalling are essential in KRAS mutant tumours, and establish a general approach for the rational identification of co-dependent pathways in cancer.","[Barbie, David A.; Kim, So Young; Moody, Susan E.; Dunn, Ian F.; Schinzel, Anna C.; Mermel, Craig; Sheng, Qing; Livingston, David M.; Meyerson, Matthew; Gilliland, D.

These functions are accomplished in nature by only a limited number of redox-active agents. A long-standing issue in these fields is how redox potentials are fine-tuned over a broad range with little change to the redox-active site or electron-transfer properties. Resolving this issue will not only advance our fundamental understanding of the roles of long-range, non-covalent interactions in redox processes, but also allow for design of redox-active proteins having tailor-made redox potentials for applications such as artificial photosynthetic centres(1,2) or fuel cell catalysts(3) for energy conversion. Here we show that two important secondary coordination sphere interactions, hydrophobicity and hydrogen-bonding, are capable of tuning the reduction potential of the cupredoxin azurin over a 700 mV range, surpassing the highest and lowest reduction potentials reported for any mononuclear cupredoxin, without perturbing the metal binding site beyond what is typical for the cupredoxin family of proteins. We also demonstrate that the effects of individual structural features are additive and that redox potential tuning of azurin is now predictable across the full range of cupredoxin potentials.","[Marshall, Nicholas M.; Garner, Dewain K.; Wilson, Tiffany D.; Gao, Yi-Gui; Nilges, Mark J.; Lu, Yi] Univ Illinois, Dept Chem, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Robinson, Howard] Brookhaven Natl Lab, Dept Biol, Upton, NY 11973 USA","Lu, Y (reprint author), Univ Illinois, Dept Chem, 1209 W Calif St, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.",yi-lu@illinois.edu,"Lu, Yi/B-5461-2010","Lu, Yi/0000-0003-1221-6709",US National Science Foundation [CHE 05-52008]; National Institutes of Health [5 T32 GM070421]; National Institute of General Medical Sciences,"This material is based on work supported by the US National Science Foundation under award no.

Nitrous oxide (N(2)O) is a greenhouse gas that is an intermediate during the biological process known as denitrification(2). Copper-containing nitrite reductase (CuNIR) is a key enzyme in the process; it produces a precursor for N(2)O by catalysing the one-electron reduction of nitrite (NO(2)(-)) to nitric oxide (NO)(3). The reduction step is performed by an efficient electron-transfer reaction with a redox-partner protein(4-6). However, details of the mechanism during the electron-transfer reaction are still unknown. Here we show the high-resolution crystal structure of the electron-transfer complex for CuNIR with its cognate cytochrome c as the electron donor. The hydrophobic electron-transfer path is formed at the docking interface by desolvation owing to close contact between the two proteins. Structural analysis of the interface highlights an essential role for the loop region with a hydrophobic patch for protein-protein recognition; it also shows how interface construction allows the variation in atomic components to achieve diverse biological electron transfers.","[Nojiri, Masaki; Koteishi, Hiroyasu; Nakagami, Takuya; Yamaguchi, Kazuya; Suzuki, Shinnichiro] Osaka Univ, Grad Sch Sci, Dept Chem, Osaka 5600043, Japan; [Kobayashi, Kazuo] Osaka Univ, Inst Sci & Ind Res, Osaka 5670047, Japan; [Inoue, Tsuyoshi] Osaka Univ, Grad Sch Engn, Dept Chem Mat, Suita, Osaka 5650871, Japan","Nojiri, M (reprint author), Osaka Univ, Grad Sch Sci, Dept Chem, Osaka 5600043, Japan.",nojiri@ch.wani.osaka-u.ac.jp; bic@ch.wani.osaka-u.ac.jp,"Kobayashi, Kazuo/H-9279-2012",,"Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology of Japan [20750137]; Sumitomo Foundation;  [20350078]","We thank A.

This view is supported by U-Pb and I-Xe chronologies, which show that water delivery peaked similar to 100 million years after the isolation of the Solar System. Introduction of water into the terrestrial mantle triggered plate tectonics, which may have been crucial for the emergence of life.

The feasibility of obtaining genome sequences from experimentally evolving populations offers the opportunity to investigate this relationship with new precision. Here we sequence genomes sampled through 40,000 generations from a laboratory population of Escherichia coli. Although adaptation decelerated sharply, genomic evolution was nearly constant for 20,000 generations. Such clock-like regularity is usually viewed as the signature of neutral evolution, but several lines of evidence indicate that almost all of these mutations were beneficial. This same population later evolved an elevated mutation rate and accumulated hundreds of additional mutations dominated by a neutral signature. Thus, the coupling between genomic and adaptive evolution is complex and can be counterintuitive even in a constant environment. In particular, beneficial substitutions were surprisingly uniform over time, whereas neutral substitutions were highly variable.","[Barrick, Jeffrey E.; Lenski, Richard E.] Michigan State Univ, Dept Microbiol & Mol Genet, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Yu, Dong Su; Yoon, Sung Ho; Jeong, Haeyoung; Oh, Tae Kwang; Kim, Jihyun F.] Korea Res Inst Biosci & Biotechnol, Ind Biotechnol & Bioenergy Res Ctr, Taejon 305806, South Korea; [Yu, Dong Su] Chungnam Natl Univ, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Taejon 305764, South Korea; [Oh, Tae Kwang] 21C Frontier Microbial Genom & Applicat Ctr, Taejon 305806, South Korea; [Schneider, Dominique] Univ Grenoble 1, CNRS, UMR 5163, Inst Jean Roget,Lab Adaptat & Pathogenie Microorg, F-38042 Grenoble 9, France; [Kim, Jihyun F.] Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Sci, Funct Genom Program, Taejon 305333, South Korea","Lenski, RE (reprint author), Michigan State Univ, Dept Microbiol & Mol Genet, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA.",lenski@msu.edu; jfk@kribb.re.kr,"Barrick, Jeffrey/A-3046-2012; Kim, Jihyun/B-6286-2013; Schneider, Dominique/M-6019-2014","Kim, Jihyun/0000-0001-7715-6992; Lenski, Richard/0000-0002-1064-8375","DARPA 'Fun Bio' Program; US National Science Foundation; Agence Nationale de la Recherche Programme 'Genomique Microbienne a Grande Echelle, Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, and Universite Joseph Fourier; Ministry of Education, Science and Technology, Republic of Korea","We thank collaborators in the Lenski and Schneider laboratories for sharing unpublished data; N.

By comprehensively analysing the three-dimensional structures of protein-DNA complexes, here we show that the binding of arginine residues to narrow minor grooves is a widely used mode for protein-DNA recognition. This readout mechanism exploits the phenomenon that narrow minor grooves strongly enhance the negative electrostatic potential of the DNA. The nucleosome core particle offers a prominent example of this effect. Minor-groove narrowing is often associated with the presence of A-tracts, AT-rich sequences that exclude the flexible TpA step. These findings indicate that the ability to detect local variations in DNA shape and electrostatic potential is a general mechanism that enables proteins to use information in the minor groove, which otherwise offers few opportunities for the formation of base-specific hydrogen bonds, to achieve DNA-binding specificity.","[Rohs, Remo; West, Sean M.; Sosinsky, Alona; Liu, Peng; Honig, Barry] Columbia Univ, Dept Biochem & Mol Biophys, Ctr Computat Biol & Bioinformat, Howard Hughes Med Inst, New York, NY 10032 USA","Honig, B (reprint author), Columbia Univ, Dept Biochem & Mol Biophys, Ctr Computat Biol & Bioinformat, Howard Hughes Med Inst, 1130 St Nicholas Ave, New York, NY 10032 USA.",rsm10@columbia.edu; bh6@columbia.edu,"Rohs, Remo/F-5752-2011",,"National Institutes of Health (NIH) [GM54510, U54 CA121852]",This work was supported by National Institutes of Health (NIH) grants GM54510 (R.

Their rapidly fading afterglows are often bright enough at optical wavelengths that they are detectable at cosmological distances. Hitherto, the highest known redshift for a GRB was z = 6.7 (ref. 1), for GRB 080913, and for a galaxy was z = 6.96 (ref. 2). Here we report observations of GRB 090423 and the near-infrared spectroscopic measurement of its redshift, z = 8.1(-0.3)(+0.1). This burst happened when the Universe was only about 4 per cent of its current age(3). Its properties are similar to those of GRBs observed at low/intermediate redshifts, suggesting that the mechanisms and progenitors that gave rise to this burst about 600,000,000 years after the Big Bang are not markedly different from those producing GRBs about 10,000,000,000 years later.","[Salvaterra, R.; Campana, S.; Chincarini, G.; Covino, S.; D'Avanzo, P.; Margutti, R.; Thoene, C.

This so-called ponderomotive force(1) plays a major part in a variety of physical situations such as Paul traps(2,3) for charged particles, electron diffraction in strong (standing) laser fields(4-6) (the Kapitza-Dirac effect) and laser-based particle acceleration(7-9). Comparably weak forces on neutral atoms in inhomogeneous light fields may arise from the dynamical polarization of an atom(10-12); these are physically similar to the cycle-averaged forces. Here we observe previously unconsidered extremely strong kinematic forces on neutral atoms in short-pulse laser fields. We identify the ponderomotive force on electrons as the driving mechanism, leading to ultrastrong acceleration of neutral atoms with a magnitude as high as similar to 10(14) times the Earth's gravitational acceleration, g. To our knowledge, this is by far the highest observed acceleration on neutral atoms in external fields and may lead to new applications in both fundamental and applied physics.","[Eichmann, U.; Nubbemeyer, T.; Rottke, H.; Sandner, W.] Max Born Inst, D-12489 Berlin, Germany; [Eichmann, U.; Sandner, W.] Tech Univ Berlin, Inst Opt & Atomare Phys, D-10632 Berlin, Germany","Eichmann, U (reprint author), Max Born Inst, Max Born Str 2A, D-12489 Berlin, Germany.",ulli.eichmann@mbi-berlin.de,,,,,,25,87,91,6,52,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,29-Oct,2009,461,7268,,,,,1261,U93,,10.1038/nature08481,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,511TF,WOS:000271190800044,19865167,No,,,11/20/17

Dynamical decoupling(3-9), which uses stroboscopic spin flips to give an average coupling to the environment that is effectively zero, is a particularly promising strategy for combating decoherence because it can be naturally integrated with other desired functionalities, such as quantum gates. Errors are inevitably introduced in each spin flip, so it is desirable to minimize the number of control pulses used to realize dynamical decoupling having a given level of precision. Such optimal dynamical decoupling sequences have recently been explored(9-12). The experimental realization of optimal dynamical decoupling in solid-state systems, however, remains elusive. Here we use pulsed electron paramagnetic resonance to demonstrate experimentally optimal dynamical decoupling for preserving electron spin coherence in irradiated malonic acid crystals at temperatures from 50 K to room temperature. Using a seven-pulse optimal dynamical decoupling sequence, we prolonged the spin coherence time to about 30 mu s; it would otherwise be about 0.04 mu s without control or 6.2 mu s under one-pulse control. By comparing experiments with microscopic theories, we have identified the relevant electron spin decoherence mechanisms in the solid. Optimal dynamical decoupling may be applied to other solid-state systems, such as diamonds with nitrogen-vacancy centres(13-15), and so lay the foundation for quantum coherence control of spins in solids at room temperature.","[Du, Jiangfeng; Rong, Xing; Wang, Ya; Yang, Jiahui] Univ Sci & Technol China, Hefei Natl Lab Phys Sci Microscale, Hefei 230026, Anhui, Peoples R China; [Du, Jiangfeng; Rong, Xing; Wang, Ya; Yang, Jiahui] Univ Sci & Technol China, Dept Modern Phys, Hefei 230026, Anhui, Peoples R China; [Zhao, Nan; Liu, R.

Andesite petrogenesis is therefore fundamental in terms of both volcanic hazard and differentiation of the Earth. Andesites typically contain a significant proportion of crystals showing disequilibrium petrographic characteristics indicative of mixing or mingling between silicic and mafic magmas, which fuels a long-standing debate regarding the significance of these processes in andesite petrogenesis(2) and ultimately questions the abundance of true liquids with andesitic composition. Central to this debate is the distinction between liquids (or melts) and magmas, mixtures of liquids with crystals, which may or may not be co-genetic. With this distinction comes the realization that bulk-rock chemical analyses of petrologically complex andesites can lead to a blurred picture of the fundamental processes behind arc magmatism. Here we present an alternative view of andesite petrogenesis, based on a review of quenched glassy melt inclusions trapped in phenocrysts, whole-rock chemistry, and high-pressure and high-temperature experiments. We argue that true liquids of intermediate composition (59 to 66 wt% SiO(2)) are far less common in the sub-volcanic reservoirs of arc volcanoes than is suggested by the abundance of erupted magma within this compositional range. Effective mingling within upper crustal magmatic reservoirs obscures a compositional bimodality of melts ascending from the lower crust, and masks the fundamental role of silicic melts (>= 66 wt% SiO(2)) beneath intermediate arc volcanoes. This alternative view resolves several puzzling aspects of arc volcanism and provides important clues to the integration of plutonic and volcanic records.","[Reubi, Olivier; Blundy, Jon] Univ Bristol, Dept Earth Sci, Bristol BS8 1RJ, Avon, England","Reubi, O (reprint author), ETH, Inst Isotope Geochem & Mineral Resources, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland.",olivier.reubi@erdw.ethz.ch,,,Marie Curie Fellowship; NERC,"This work was supported by a Marie Curie Fellowship (O.

Two biophysical mechanisms have become established as the most promising magnetodetection candidates. The iron-mineral-based hypothesis suggests that magnetic information is detected by magnetoreceptors in the upper beak and transmitted through the ophthalmic branch of the trigeminal nerve to the brain(5-10). The light-dependent hypothesis suggests that magnetic field direction is sensed by radical pair-forming photopigments in the eyes(11-15) and that this visual signal is processed in cluster N, a specialized, night-time active, light-processing forebrain region(16-19). Here we report that European robins with bilateral lesions of cluster N are unable to show oriented magnetic-compass-guided behaviour but are able to perform sun compass and star compass orientation behaviour. In contrast, bilateral section of the ophthalmic branch of the trigeminal nerve in European robins did not influence the birds' ability to use their magnetic compass for orientation. These data show that cluster N is required for magnetic compass orientation in this species and indicate that it may be specifically involved in processing of magnetic compass information. Furthermore, the data strongly suggest that a vision-mediated mechanism underlies the magnetic compass in this migratory songbird, and that the putative iron-mineral-based receptors in the upper beak connected to the brain by the trigeminal nerve(6-8) are neither necessary nor sufficient for magnetic compass orientation in European robins.","[Zapka, Manuela; Heyers, Dominik; Hein, Christine M.; Engels, Svenja; Schneider, Nils-Lasse; Hans, Joerg; Weiler, Simon; Dreyer, David; Kishkinev, Dmitry; Mouritsen, Henrik] Carl von Ossietzky Univ Oldenburg, IBU, AG Neurosensorik Anim Nav, D-26111 Oldenburg, Germany; [Wild, J.

This suggests that compartmentalized, synapse-specific action of GABA is required in cortical networks for phasic inhibition(2-4). However, GABA released at the synaptic cleft diffuses to receptors outside the postsynaptic density and thus tonically activates extrasynaptic GABA(A) and GABA(B) receptors, which include subtypes of both receptor families especially sensitive to low concentrations of GABA(3-7). The synaptic and extrasynaptic action of GABA corroborates the idea that neurons of the brain use synaptic (or wiring) transmission and non-synaptic (or volume) transmission for communication(8,9). However, re-uptake mechanisms restrict the spatial extent of extrasynaptic GABA-mediated effects(10,11), and it has been proposed that the concerted action of several presynaptic interneurons, the sustained firing of individual cells or an increase in release-site density is required to reach ambient GABA levels sufficient to activate extrasynaptic receptors(4,9,11-13). Here we show that individual neurogliaform cells release enough GABA for volume transmission within the axonal cloud and, thus, that neurogliaform cells do not require synapses to produce inhibitory responses in the overwhelming majority of nearby neurons. Neurogliaform cells suppress connections between other neurons acting on presynaptic terminals that do not receive synapses at all in the cerebral cortex. They also reach extrasynaptic, delta-subunit-containing GABA(A) (GABA(A delta)) receptors responsible for tonic inhibition. We show that GABA(A delta) receptors are localized to neurogliaform cells preferentially among cortical interneurons. Neurosteroids, which are modulators of GABA(A delta) receptors, alter unitary GABA-mediated effects between neurogliaform cells. In contrast to the specifically placed synapses formed by other interneurons, the output of neurosteroid-sensitive neurogliaform cells represents the ultimate form of the lack of spatial specificity in GABA-mediated systems, leading to long-lasting network hyperpolarization combined with widespread suppression of communication in the local circuit.","[Olah, Szabolcs; Miklos Fuele; Gergely Komlosi; Csaba Varga; Rita Baldi; Gabor Tamas] Univ Szeged, Dept Physiol Anat & Neurosci, Res Grp Cort Microcircuits, Hungarian Acad Sci, H-6726 Szeged, Hungary; [Pal Barzo] Univ Szeged, Dept Neurosurg, H-6725 Szeged, Hungary","Gabor, T (reprint author), Univ Szeged, Dept Physiol Anat & Neurosci, Res Grp Cort Microcircuits, Hungarian Acad Sci, Kozep Fasor 52, H-6726 Szeged, Hungary.",gtamas@bio.u-szeged.hu,,,European Young Investigator Award; Hungarian National Office for Research and Technology Polanyi Award; Howard Hughes Medical Institute; US National Institutes of Health [NS535915]; Boehringer Ingelheim Fonds; Hungarian Academy of Sciences,"The authors thank W.

However, recent evidence indicates that normal intestinal microbiota might also positively influence immune responses, and protect against the development of inflammatory diseases(1,2). One of these elements may be short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), which are produced by fermentation of dietary fibre by intestinal microbiota. A feature of human ulcerative colitis and other colitic diseases is a change in 'healthy' microbiota such as Bifidobacterium and Bacteriodes(3), and a concurrent reduction in SCFAs(4). Moreover, increased intake of fermentable dietary fibre, or SCFAs, seems to be clinically beneficial in the treatment of colitis(5-9). SCFAs bind the G-protein-coupled receptor 43 (GPR43, also known as FFAR2)(10,11), and here we show that SCFA-GPR43 interactions profoundly affect inflammatory responses. Stimulation of GPR43 by SCFAs was necessary for the normal resolution of certain inflammatory responses, because GPR43-deficient (Gpr43(-/-)) mice showed exacerbated or unresolving inflammation in models of colitis, arthritis and asthma. This seemed to relate to increased production of inflammatory mediators by Gpr43(-/-) immune cells, and increased immune cell recruitment. Germ-free mice, which are devoid of bacteria and express little or no SCFAs, showed a similar dysregulation of certain inflammatory responses. GPR43 binding of SCFAs potentially provides a molecular link between diet, gastrointestinal bacterial metabolism, and immune and inflammatory responses.","[Maslowski, Kendle M.; Vieira, Angelica T.; Kranich, Jan; Sierro, Frederic; Yu, Di; Schilter, Heidi C.; Rolph, Michael S.; Mackay, Fabienne; Mackay, Charles R.] St Vincents Hosp, Garvan Inst Med Res, Darlinghurst, NSW 2010, Australia; [Maslowski, Kendle M.; Kranich, Jan; Schilter, Heidi C.; Rolph, Michael S.; Mackay, Charles R.] Cooperat Res Ctr Asthma & Airways, Camperdown, NSW 2050, Australia; [Maslowski, Kendle M.; Schilter, Heidi C.; Mackay, Charles R.] Univ New S Wales, St Vincents Clin Sch, Sydney, NSW 2010, Australia; [Vieira, Angelica T.; Teixeira, Mauro M.] Univ Fed Minas Gerais, Inst Ciencias Biol, Dept Biochem & Immunol, BR-31270901 Belo Horizonte, MG, Brazil; [Ng, Aylwin; Xavier, Ramnik J.] Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Gastrointestinal Unit, Boston, MA 02114 USA; [Ng, Aylwin; Xavier, Ramnik J.] Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Ctr Computat & Integrat Biol, Boston, MA 02114 USA; [Ng, Aylwin; Xavier, Ramnik J.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Boston, MA 02114 USA; [Mackay, Fabienne; Mackay, Charles R.] Monash Univ, Fac Med, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia; [Artis, David] Univ Penn, Sch Vet Med, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Xavier, Ramnik J.] MIT, Broad Inst, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; [Xavier, Ramnik J.] Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA","Mackay, CR (reprint author), St Vincents Hosp, Garvan Inst Med Res, 384 Victoria St, Darlinghurst, NSW 2010, Australia.",charles.mackay@med.monash.edu.au,"Mackay, Charles/A-9673-2008; Sierro, Frederic/B-9742-2009; Yu, Di/C-2163-2009; Mackay, Fabienne/B-7440-2008; Vieira, Angelica/A-6227-2015","Mackay, Charles/0000-0002-6338-7340; Sierro, Frederic/0000-0001-5004-8414; Yu, Di/0000-0003-1721-8922; Mackay, Fabienne/0000-0002-6074-2693; Vieira, Angelica/0000-0002-4556-7671; Maslowski, Kendle/0000-0003-1995-5424",Australian NHMRC; CRC for Asthma and Airways; Crohn's and Colitis Foundation of America; Cancer Institute NSW,"The authors thank P.

Resolvins are a new family of lipid mediators enzymatically generated within resolution networks that possess unique and specific functions to orchestrate catabasis, the phase in which disease declines(2,3). Resolvin D2 (RvD2) was originally identified in resolving exudates, yet its individual contribution in resolution remained to be elucidated. Here, we establish RvD2's potent stereoselective actions in reducing excessive neutrophil trafficking to inflammatory loci. RvD2 decreased leukocyte-endothelial interactions in vivo by endothelial-dependent nitric oxide production, and by direct modulation of leukocyte adhesion receptor expression. In mice with microbial sepsis initiated by caecal ligation and puncture, RvD2 sharply decreased both local and systemic bacterial burden, excessive cytokine production and neutrophil recruitment, while increasing peritoneal mononuclear cells and macrophage phagocytosis. These multi-level pro-resolving actions of RvD2 translate to increased survival from sepsis induced by caecal ligation and puncture and surgery. Together, these results identify RvD2 as a potent endogenous regulator of excessive inflammatory responses that acts via multiple cellular targets to stimulate resolution and preserve immune vigilance.","[Spite, Matthew; Norling, Lucy V.; Summers, Lisa; Yang, Rong; Serhan, Charles N.] Brigham & Womens Hosp, Ctr Expt Therapeut & Reperfus Injury, Dept Anesthesiol Perioperat & Pain Med, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Spite, Matthew; Norling, Lucy V.; Summers, Lisa; Yang, Rong; Serhan, Charles N.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Norling, Lucy V.; Cooper, Dianne; Flower, Roderick J.; Perretti, Mauro] Queen Mary Univ London, Barts & London Med Sch, William Harvey Res Inst, London EC1M 6BQ, England; [Petasis, Nicos A.] Univ So Calif, Loker Hydrocarbon Res Inst, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA; [Petasis, Nicos A.] Univ So Calif, Dept Chem, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA","Serhan, CN (reprint author), Brigham & Womens Hosp, Ctr Expt Therapeut & Reperfus Injury, Dept Anesthesiol Perioperat & Pain Med, 75 Francis St, Boston, MA 02115 USA.",cnserhan@zeus.bwh.harvard.edu,"Spite, Matthew/B-3337-2010","Petasis, Nicos/0000-0002-8864-4446","National Institutes of Health [GM-38765, P50-DE016191]; Welcome Trust [086867/Z/08/Z, 085903/Z/08]; Arthritis Research Campaign UK [18445, 18103]; NHLBI [HL087526]","We acknowledge support from National Institutes of Health grants GM-38765 and P50-DE016191 (C.

For example, development of post-implantation epiblast cells from primitive ectoderm involves significant transcriptional and epigenetic changes, including DNA methylation and X chromosome inactivation(2), which create a robust epigenetic barrier and prevent their reversion to a primitive-ectoderm-like state. Epiblast cells are refractory to leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF)-STAT3 signalling, but they respond to activin/basic fibroblast growth factor to form self-renewing epiblast stem cells (EpiSCs), which exhibit essential properties of epiblast cells(3,4) and that differ from embryonic stem (ES) cells derived from primitive ectoderm(5). Here we show reprogramming of advanced epiblast cells fromembryonic day 5.5-7.5mouseembryos with uniform expression of N-cadherin and inactive X chromosome to ES-cell-like cells (rESCs) in response to LIF-STAT3 signalling. Cultured epiblast cells overcome the epigenetic barrier progressively as they proceed with the erasure of key properties of epiblast cells, resulting in DNA demethylation, X reactivation and expression of E-cadherin. The accompanying changes in the transcriptome result in a loss of phenotypic and epigenetic memory of epiblast cells. Using this approach, we report reversion of established EpiSCs to rESCs. Moreover, unlike epiblast and EpiSCs, rESCs contribute to somatic tissues and germ cells in chimaeras. Further studies may reveal how signalling-induced epigenetic reprogramming may promote reacquisition of pluripotency.","[Bao, Siqin; Tang, Fuchou; Hayashi, Katsuhiko; Gillich, Astrid; Surani, M.

The amplification loop occurs in a Dicer-independent, PIWI-Slicer-dependent manner(3,4,8). However, primary piRNA processing remains elusive. Here we analysed piRNA processing in a Drosophila ovarian somatic cell line where Piwi, but not Aub or AGO3, is expressed; thus, only the primary piRNAs exist. In addition to flamenco, a Piwi-specific piRNA cluster(3), traffic jam (tj)(9), a large Maf gene, was determined as a new piRNA cluster. piRNAs arising from tj correspond to the untranslated regions of tj messenger RNA and are sense-oriented. piRNA loading on to Piwi may occur in the cytoplasm. zucchini(10), a gene encoding a putative cytoplasmic nuclease, is required for tj-derived piRNA production. In tj and piwi mutant ovaries, somatic cells fail to intermingle with germ cells and Fasciclin III is overexpressed. Loss of tj abolishes Piwi expression in gonadal somatic cells. Thus, in gonadal somatic cells, tj gives rise simultaneously to two different molecules: the TJ protein, which activates Piwi expression, and piRNAs, which define the Piwi targets for silencing.","[Saito, Kuniaki; Inagaki, Sachi; Kawamura, Yoshinori; Kotani, Hazuki; Siomi, Haruhiko; Siomi, Mikiko C.] Keio Univ, Sch Med, Tokyo 1608582, Japan; [Mituyama, Toutai; Asai, Kiyoshi] Natl Inst Adv Ind Sci & Technol, CBRC, Tokyo 1350064, Japan; [Kawamura, Yoshinori] Univ Tokushima, Inst Hlth Biosci, Tokushima 7708503, Japan; [Ono, Yukiteru] Informat & Math Sci Lab Inc, Dept Life Sci, Tokushima 1120012, Japan; [Sakota, Eri] JBIC, Tokyo 1358073, Japan; [Asai, Kiyoshi] Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Frontier Sci, Chiba 2778583, Japan; [Siomi, Mikiko C.] CREST, JST, Kawaguchi, Saitama 3320012, Japan","Siomi, H (reprint author), Keio Univ, Sch Med, Tokyo 1608582, Japan.",awa403@sc.itc.keio.ac.jp; siomim@sc.itc.keio.ac.jp,"Saito, Kuniaki/A-6967-2015; Siomi, Haruhiko/A-7020-2015","Saito, Kuniaki/0000-0001-8233-9283; Siomi, Haruhiko/0000-0001-8690-3822; Inagaki, Sachi/0000-0002-2365-9938; Mituyama, Toutai/0000-0002-1110-6375",MEXT; NEDO ( New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization); CREST,"We thank Y.

The monomeric homing endonuclease I-AniI cleaves with high sequence specificity in the centre of a 20-base-pair ( bp) DNA target site, with the amino (N)-terminal domain of the enzyme making extensive binding interactions with the left (-) side of the target site and the similarly structured carboxy (C)-terminal domain interacting with the right (+) side(2). Here we show that, despite the approximate twofold symmetry of the enzyme-DNA complex, there is almost complete segregation of interactions responsible for substrate binding to the (-) side of the interface and interactions responsible for transition-state stabilization to the (+) side. Although single base-pair substitutions throughout the entire DNA target site reduce catalytic efficiency, mutations in the (-) DNA half-site almost exclusively increase the dissociation constant (K(D)) and the Michaelis constant under single-turnover conditions (K(M)*), and those in the (+) half-site primarily decrease the turnover number (k(cat)*). The reduction of activity produced by mutations on the (-) side, but not mutations on the (+) side, can be suppressed by tethering the substrate to the endonuclease displayed on the surface of yeast. This dramatic asymmetry in the use of enzyme-substrate binding energy for catalysis has direct relevance to the redesign of endonucleases to cleave genomic target sites for gene therapy and other applications. Computationally redesigned enzymes that achieve new specificities on the (-) side do so by modulating K(M)*, whereas redesigns with altered specificities on the (+) side modulate k(cat)*.

Although closely related species often have different sex-chromosome systems, it is unknown whether sex-chromosome turnover contributes to the evolution of reproductive isolation between species. Here we show that a newly evolved sex chromosome contains genes that contribute to speciation in threespine stickleback fish (Gasterosteus aculeatus). We first identified a neo-sex chromosome system found only in one member of a sympatric species pair in Japan. We then performed genetic linkage mapping of male-specific traits important for reproductive isolation between the Japanese species pair. The neo-X chromosome contains loci for male courtship display traits that contribute to behavioural isolation, whereas the ancestral X chromosome contains loci for both behavioural isolation and hybrid male sterility. Our work not only provides strong evidence for a large X-effect on reproductive isolation in a vertebrate system, but also provides direct evidence that a young neo-X chromosome contributes to reproductive isolation between closely related species. Our data indicate that sex-chromosome turnover might have a greater role in speciation than was previously appreciated.","[Kitano, Jun; Ross, Joseph A.; Peichel, Catherine L.] Fred Hutchinson Canc Res Ctr, Div Human Biol, Seattle, WA 98109 USA; [Ross, Joseph A.] Univ Washington, Grad Program Mol & Cellular Biol, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Mori, Seiichi] Gifu Keizai Univ, Biol Lab, Gifu 5038550, Japan; [Kume, Manabu] Publ Works Res Inst, Aqua Restorat Res Ctr, Gifu 5016021, Japan; [Jones, Felicity C.; Chan, Yingguang F.; Kingsley, David M.] Stanford Univ, Dept Dev Biol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Jones, Felicity C.; Chan, Yingguang F.; Kingsley, David M.] Stanford Univ, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Absher, Devin M.; Grimwood, Jane; Schmutz, Jeremy; Myers, Richard M.] Stanford Univ, Dept Genet, Stanford, CA 94304 USA; [Absher, Devin M.; Grimwood, Jane; Schmutz, Jeremy; Myers, Richard M.] Stanford Univ, Stanford Human Genome Ctr, Stanford, CA 94304 USA","Peichel, CL (reprint author), Fred Hutchinson Canc Res Ctr, Div Human Biol, 1100 Fairview Ave N, Seattle, WA 98109 USA.",cpeichel@fhcrc.org,"Chan, Yingguang/A-7654-2011; Ross, Joseph/D-1574-2012; Schmutz, Jeremy/N-3173-2013","Chan, Yingguang/0000-0001-6292-9681; Schmutz, Jeremy/0000-0001-8062-9172; Jones, Felicity/0000-0002-5027-1031","Uehara Memorial Foundation; Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology of Japan; Water and People Project of Research Institute for Humanity and Nature; Akkeshi Town Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research in the Lake Akkeshi-Bekanbeushi Wetland; Burroughs Wellcome Fund Career Award in the Biomedical Sciences; National Institutes of Health [T32 GM07270, R01 GM071854, P50 HG02568]","We thank M.

However, signalling between stromal and tumour cells is complex and remains poorly understood. Here we show that the genetic inactivation of Pten in stromal fibroblasts of mouse mammary glands accelerated the initiation, progression and malignant transformation of mammary epithelial tumours. This was associated with the massive remodelling of the extracellular matrix (ECM), innate immune cell infiltration and increased angiogenesis. Loss of Pten in stromal fibroblasts led to increased expression, phosphorylation (T72) and recruitment of Ets2 to target promoters known to be involved in these processes. Remarkably, Ets2 inactivation in Pten stroma-deleted tumours ameliorated disruption of the tumour microenvironment and was sufficient to decrease tumour growth and progression. Global gene expression profiling of mammary stromal cells identified a Pten-specific signature that was highly represented in the tumour stroma of patients with breast cancer. These findings identify the Pten-Ets2 axis as a critical stroma-specific signalling pathway that suppresses mammary epithelial tumours.","[Cantemir-Stone, Carmen Z.; Li, Fu; Wallace, Julie A.; Merchant, Anand; Wei, Guo; Sharma, Sudarshana M.; Ostrowski, Michael C.] Ohio State Univ, Coll Med, Dept Mol & Cellular Biochem, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Trimboli, Anthony J.; Li, Fu; Creasap, Nicholas; Thompson, John C.; Caserta, Enrico; Wang, Hui; Chong, Jean-Leon; Naidu, Shan; Wei, Guo; Weinstein, Michael B.; Leone, Gustavo] Ohio State Univ, Dept Mol Genet, Coll Biol Sci, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Trimboli, Anthony J.; Creasap, Nicholas; Thompson, John C.; Caserta, Enrico; Wang, Hui; Chong, Jean-Leon; Naidu, Shan; Weinstein, Michael B.; Leone, Gustavo] Ohio State Univ, Dept Mol Virol Immunol & Med Genet, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Naidu, Shan; Rosol, Thomas J.; Stromberg, Paul C.] Ohio State Univ, Dept Vet Biosci, Coll Vet Med, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Stephens, Julie A.; Fernandez, Soledad A.] Ohio State Univ, Ctr Biostat, Off Hlth Sci, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Gurcan, Metin N.] Ohio State Univ, Dept Biomed Informat, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Barsky, Sanford H.] Ohio State Univ, Dept Pathol, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Yee, Lisa] Ohio State Univ, Dept Surg, Sch Med, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Robinson, Michael L.] Columbus Childrens Res Inst, Ctr Mol & Human Genet, Columbus, OH 43205 USA; [Pepin, Francois; Hallett, Michael; Park, Morag] McGill Univ, Rosalind & Morris Goodman Canc Ctr, Dept Biochem, Montreal, PQ H3A 1A1, Canada; [Pepin, Francois; Hallett, Michael] McGill Univ, McGill Ctr Bioinformat, Montreal, PQ H3A 1A1, Canada; [Park, Morag] McGill Univ, Dept Oncol, Montreal, PQ H3A 1A1, Canada; [Ostrowski, Michael C.; Leone, Gustavo] Ohio State Univ, Ctr Comprehens Canc, Tumor Microenvironm Program, Columbus, OH 43210 USA","Ostrowski, MC (reprint author), Ohio State Univ, Coll Med, Dept Mol & Cellular Biochem, Columbus, OH 43210 USA.",michael.ostrowski@osumc.edu; gustavo.leone@osumc.edu,"Merchant, Anand/B-3467-2010; Li, Fu/E-7072-2011; Peng, Chunwei/F-6788-2010; Ostrowski, Michael/H-3108-2011; Rosol, Thomas/G-9585-2011","Ostrowski, Michael/0000-0003-2948-6297; Rosol, Thomas/0000-0003-3737-1190","National Institutes of Health [R01CA85619, R01HD47470, P01CA097189, R01CA053271]; Komen Breast Cancer Foundation; Evelyn Simmers Charitable Trust; Terry Fox New Frontiers Group Grant; Natural Science and Engineering Research Council of Canada Discovery Grants Program; Department of Defense Pre- doctoral Fellowships; Department of Defense Postdoctoral Fellowship; Pew Charitable Trusts Scholar Award; Leukemia and Lymphoma Society Scholar Award; Diane and Sal Guerrera Chair in Cancer Genetics at McGill University","We thank M.

Escherichia coli SSB, a representative homotetrameric SSB, binds to ssDNA by wrapping the DNA using its four subunits. However, such a tightly wrapped, high-affinity protein-DNA complex still needs to be removed or repositioned quickly for unhindered action of other proteins. Here we show, using single-molecule two- and three-colour fluorescence resonance energy transfer, that tetrameric SSB can spontaneously migrate along ssDNA. Diffusional migration of SSB helps in the local displacement of SSB by an elongating RecA filament. SSB diffusion also melts short DNA hairpins transiently and stimulates RecA filament elongation on DNA with secondary structure. This observation of diffusional movement of a protein on ssDNA introduces a new model for how an SSB protein can be redistributed, while remaining tightly bound to ssDNA during recombination and repair processes.","[Roy, Rahul; Ha, Taekjip] Univ Illinois, Ctr Biophys & Computat Biol, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Roy, Rahul; Ha, Taekjip] Univ Illinois, Dept Phys, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Roy, Rahul; Ha, Taekjip] Univ Illinois, Ctr Phys Living Cells, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Kozlov, Alexander G.; Lohman, Timothy M.] Washington Univ, Sch Med, Dept Biochem & Mol Biophys, St Louis, MO 63110 USA; [Ha, Taekjip] Howard Hughes Med Inst, Urbana, IL 61801 USA","Ha, T (reprint author), Univ Illinois, Ctr Biophys & Computat Biol, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.",tjha@illinois.edu,"Roy, Rahul/D-5329-2009; Ha, Taekjip/B-9506-2009","Ha, Taekjip/0000-0003-2195-6258",National Institutes of Health; National Science Foundation,"We thank C.

The best known exceptions are Jupiter's gossamer rings(1) and Saturn's E ring, broad sheets of dust that extend outward until they fade from view at five to ten planetary radii. Source satellites continuously supply the dust, which is subsequently lost in collisions or by radial transport. Here we report that Saturn has an enormous ring associated with its outer moon Phoebe, extending from at least 128R(S) to 207R(S) ( Saturn's radius R(S) is 60,330 km). The ring's vertical thickness of 40R(S) matches the range of vertical motion of Phoebe along its orbit. Dynamical considerations argue that these ring particles span the Saturnian system from the main rings to the edges of interplanetary space. The ring's normal optical depth of similar to 2 x 10(-8) is comparable to that of Jupiter's faintest gossamer ring, although its particle number density is several hundred times smaller. Repeated impacts on Phoebe, from both interplanetary and circumplanetary particle populations, probably keep the ring populated with material. Ring particles smaller than centimetres in size slowly migrate inward(2,3) and many of them ultimately strike the dark leading face of Iapetus.","[Verbiscer, Anne J.; Skrutskie, Michael F.] Univ Virginia, Dept Astron, Charlottesville, VA 22904 USA; [Hamilton, Douglas P.] Univ Maryland, Dept Astron, College Pk, MD 20742 USA","Verbiscer, AJ (reprint author), Univ Virginia, Dept Astron, Charlottesville, VA 22904 USA.",verbiscer@virginia.edu,,,NASA through an award issued by JPL/Caltech,"This work is based on observations made with the Spitzer Space Telescope, which is operated by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology under a contract with NASA.

For example, it gives only probabilistic predictions (non-determinism) and does not allow copying of unknown states (no-cloning(1)). Quantum correlations may be stronger than any classical ones(2), but information cannot be transmitted faster than light (no-signalling). However, these features do not uniquely define quantum physics. A broad class of theories exist that share such traits and allow even stronger (than quantum) correlations(3). Here we introduce the principle of 'information causality' and show that it is respected by classical and quantum physics but violated by all no-signalling theories with stronger than (the strongest) quantum correlations. The principle relates to the amount of information that an observer ( Bob) can gain about a data set belonging to another observer (Alice), the contents of which are completely unknown to him. Using all his local resources (which may be correlated with her resources) and allowing classical communication from her, the amount of information that Bob can recover is bounded by the information volume (m) of the communication. Namely, if Alice communicates m bits to Bob, the total information obtainable by Bob cannot be greater than m. For m = 0, information causality reduces to the standard no-signalling principle. However, no-signalling theories with maximally strong correlations would allow Bob access to all the data in any m-bit subset of the whole data set held by Alice. If only one bit is sent by Alice (m = 1), this is tantamount to Bob's being able to access the value of any single bit of Alice's data (but not all of them). Information causality may therefore help to distinguish physical theories from non-physical ones. We suggest that information causality-a generalization of the no-signalling condition-might be one of the foundational properties of nature.","[Pawlowski, Marcin; Zukowski, Marek] Univ Gdansk, Inst Theoret Phys & Astrophys, PL-80952 Gdansk, Poland; [Paterek, Tomasz; Kaszlikowski, Dagomir; Scarani, Valerio; Winter, Andreas] Natl Univ Singapore, Ctr Quantum Technol, Singapore 117543, Singapore; [Paterek, Tomasz; Kaszlikowski, Dagomir; Scarani, Valerio; Winter, Andreas] Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Phys, Singapore 117543, Singapore; [Winter, Andreas] Univ Bristol, Dept Math, Bristol BS8 1TW, Avon, England","Pawlowski, M (reprint author), Univ Gdansk, Inst Theoret Phys & Astrophys, PL-80952 Gdansk, Poland.",dokmpa@univ.gda.pl,"Scarani, Valerio/G-1109-2012; Kaszlikowski, Dagomir/G-1974-2012; Pawlowski, Marcin/B-2137-2013; Winter, Andreas/C-4185-2016","Scarani, Valerio/0000-0001-5594-5616; Pawlowski, Marcin/0000-0002-8611-947X; Winter, Andreas/0000-0001-6344-4870; Zukowski, Marek/0000-0001-7882-7962",National Research Foundation; Ministry of Education in Singapore; European Commission through the Integrated Project Qubit Applications; UK Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council through the Quantum Information Processing Interdisciplinary Research Collaboration; Royal Society Wolfson Merit Award; Philip Leverhulme Prize,"We thank M.

However, many chromophores, such as haemoglobin and cytochromes, absorb but have undetectable fluorescence because the spontaneous emission is dominated by their fast non-radiative decay(3). Yet the detection of their absorption is difficult under a microscope. Here we use stimulated emission, which competes effectively with the nonradiative decay, to make the chromophores detectable, and report a new contrast mechanism for optical microscopy. In a pump-probe experiment, on photoexcitation by a pump pulse, the sample is stimulated down to the ground state by a time-delayed probe pulse, the intensity of which is concurrently increased. We extract the miniscule intensity increase with shot-noise-limited sensitivity by using a lock-in amplifier and intensity modulation of the pump beam at a high megahertz frequency. The signal is generated only at the laser foci owing to the nonlinear dependence on the input intensities, providing intrinsic three-dimensional optical sectioning capability. In contrast, conventional one-beam absorption measurement exhibits low sensitivity, lack of three-dimensional sectioning capability, and complication by linear scattering of heterogeneous samples. We demonstrate a variety of applications of stimulated emission microscopy, such as visualizing chromoproteins, non-fluorescent variants of the green fluorescent protein, monitoring lacZ gene expression with a chromogenic reporter, mapping transdermal drug distributions without histological sectioning, and label-free microvascular imaging based on endogenous contrast of haemoglobin. For all these applications, sensitivity is orders of magnitude higher than for spontaneous emission or absorption contrast, permitting non-fluorescent reporters for molecular imaging.","[Min, Wei; Lu, Sijia; Chong, Shasha; Roy, Rahul; Holtom, Gary R.; Xie, X.

Modelling studies(5,6) suggest that such ice-sheet formation might have been triggered when atmospheric carbon dioxide levels (p(CO2)(atm)) fell below a critical threshold of similar to 750 p. p. m. v., but the timing and magnitude of p(CO2)(atm) relative to the evolution of the ice sheet has remained unclear. Here we use the boron isotope pH proxy(7,8) on exceptionally well-preserved carbonate microfossils from a recently discovered geological section in Tanzania(9,10) to estimate p(CO2)(atm) before, during and after the climate transition. Our data suggest that a reduction in p(CO2)(atm) occurred before the main phase of ice growth, followed by a sharp recovery to pre-transition values and then a more gradual decline. During maximum ice-sheet growth, p(CO2)(atm) was between similar to 450 and similar to 1,500 p. p. m. v., with a central estimate of similar to 760 p. p. m. v. The ice cap survived the period of p(CO2)(atm) recovery, although possibly with some reduction in its volume, implying (as models predict(11)) a nonlinear response to climate forcing during melting. Overall, our results confirm the central role of declining p(CO2)(atm) in the development of the Antarctic ice sheet (in broad agreement with carbon cycle modelling(12)) and help to constrain mechanisms and feedbacks associated with the Earth's biggest climate switch of the past 65 Myr.","[Pearson, Paul N.] Cardiff Univ, Sch Earth & Ocean Sci, Cardiff CF10 3YE, Wales; [Foster, Gavin L.] Univ Bristol, Dept Earth Sci, Bristol Isotope Grp, Bristol BS8 1RJ, Avon, England; [Wade, Bridget S.] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Geol & Geophys, College Stn, TX 77843 USA","Pearson, PN (reprint author), Cardiff Univ, Sch Earth & Ocean Sci, Cardiff CF10 3YE, Wales.",pearsonp@cardiff.ac.uk,"Pearson, Paul/B-2276-2009; Wade, Bridget/F-4987-2014","Pearson, Paul/0000-0003-4628-9818; Wade, Bridget/0000-0002-7245-8614",NERC,"This work was supported by NERC grants to P.

Although seismic anisotropy in the uppermantle is generally attributed to the crystal-preferred orientation of olivine(3), the strong trench-parallel anisotropy (delay time of one to two seconds) observed in several subduction systems(4,5) is difficult to explain in terms of olivine anisotropy, even if the entire mantle wedge were to act as an anisotropic source. Here we show that the crystal-preferred orientation of serpentine, the main hydrous mineral in the upper mantle, can produce the strong trench-parallel seismic anisotropy observed in subduction systems. High-pressure deformation experiments reveal that the serpentine c-axis tends to rotate to an orientation normal to the shear plane during deformation; consequently, seismic velocity propagating normal to the shear plane (plate interface) is much slower than that in other directions. The seismic anisotropy estimated for deformed serpentine aggregates is an order of magnitude greater than that for olivine(6), and therefore the alignment of serpentine in the hydrated mantle wedge results in a strong trench-parallel seismic anisotropy in the case of a steeply subducting slab. This hypothesis is also consistent with the presence of a hydrous phase in the mantle wedge, as inferred from anomalously low seismic-wave velocities(7).","[Katayama, Ikuo; Hirauchi, Ken-ichi; Ando, Jun-ichi] Hiroshima Univ, Dept Earth & Planetary Syst Sci, Higashihiroshima 7398526, Japan; [Michibayashi, Katsuyoshi] Shizuoka Univ, Inst Geosci, Shizuoka 4228529, Japan","Katayama, I (reprint author), Hiroshima Univ, Dept Earth & Planetary Syst Sci, Higashihiroshima 7398526, Japan.",katayama@hiroshima-u.ac.jp,"Katayama, Ikuo/A-9611-2011","Michibayashi, Katsuyoshi/0000-0003-1845-7298",Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS),We thank T.

Adapiforms are commonly referred to as the 'lemur-like' primates of the Eocene epoch, and recent phylogenetic analyses have placed adapiforms as stem members of Strepsirrhini(2-4), a primate suborder whose crown clade includes lemurs, lorises and galagos. An alternative view is that adapiforms are stem anthropoids(5). This debate has recently been rekindled by the description of a largely complete skeleton of the adapiform Darwinius(6), from the middle Eocene of Europe, which has been widely publicised as an important 'link' in the early evolution of Anthropoidea(7). Here we describe the complete dentition and jaw of a large-bodied adapiform (Afradapis gen. nov.) from the earliest late Eocene of Egypt (similar to 37 Myr ago) that exhibits a striking series of derived dental and gnathic features that also occur in younger anthropoid primates-notably the earliest catarrhine ancestors of Old World monkeys and apes. Phylogenetic analysis of 360 morphological features scored across 117 living and extinct primates (including all candidate stem anthropoids) does not place adapiforms as haplorhines (that is, members of a Tarsius-Anthropoidea clade) or as stem anthropoids, but rather as sister taxa of crown Strepsirrhini; Afradapis and Darwinius are placed in a geographically widespread clade of caenopithecine adapiforms that left no known descendants. The specialized morphological features that these adapiforms share with anthropoids are therefore most parsimoniously interpreted as evolutionary convergences. As the largest non-anthropoid primate ever documented in Afro-Arabia, Afradapis nevertheless provides surprising new evidence for prosimian diversity in the Eocene of Africa, and raises the possibility that ecological competition between adapiforms and higher primates might have played an important role during the early evolution of stem and crown Anthropoidea in Afro-Arabia.","[Seiffert, Erik R.] SUNY Stony Brook, Dept Anat Sci, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA; [Perry, Jonathan M.

Given the effect of sleep deprivation on our lives, understanding the cellular and molecular pathways affected by sleep deprivation is clearly of social and clinical importance. One of the major effects of sleep deprivation on the brain is to produce memory deficits in learning models that are dependent on the hippocampus(2-5). Here we have identified a molecular mechanism by which brief sleep deprivation alters hippocampal function. Sleep deprivation selectively impaired 3',5'-cyclic AMP (cAMP)- and protein kinase A (PKA)-dependent forms of synaptic plasticity(6) in the mouse hippocampus, reduced cAMP signalling, and increased activity and protein levels of phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE4), an enzyme that degrades cAMP. Treatment of mice with phosphodiesterase inhibitors rescued the sleep-deprivation-induced deficits in cAMP signalling, synaptic plasticity and hippocampus-dependent memory. These findings demonstrate that brief sleep deprivation disrupts hippocampal function by interfering with cAMP signalling through increased PDE4 activity. Thus, drugs that enhance cAMP signalling may provide a new therapeutic approach to counteract the cognitive effects of sleep deprivation.","[Vecsey, Christopher G.; Jaganath, Devan; Havekes, Robbert; Daniels, Andrew; Wimmer, Mathieu; Huang, Ted; Abel, Ted] Univ Penn, Dept Biol, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Vecsey, Christopher G.; Wimmer, Mathieu; Huang, Ted] Univ Penn, Neurosci Grad Grp, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Baillie, George S.; Brown, Kim M.; Houslay, Miles D.] Univ Glasgow, Fac Biomed & Life Sci, Glasgow G12 8QQ, Lanark, Scotland; [Li, Xiang-Yao; Descalzi, Giannina; Kim, Susan S.; Chen, Tao; Shang, Yu-Ze; Zhuo, Min] Univ Toronto, Dept Physiol, Toronto, ON M5S 1A8, Canada","Abel, T (reprint author), Univ Penn, Dept Biol, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",abele@sas.upenn.edu,"Zhuo, Min/A-2072-2008; Houslay, Miles/A-6825-2011; Li, xiang-Yao/B-7622-2011; DTC, Cell & Proteomics/C-8374-2011","Zhuo, Min/0000-0001-9062-3241; Li, xiang-Yao/0000-0002-4793-0550; Jaganath, Devan/0000-0002-8555-5667; Houslay, Miles/0000-0002-3826-8091; Abel, Ted/0000-0003-2423-4592","Systems and Integrative Biology Training [GM07517]; NIH; Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research NWO-Rubicon [825.07.029]; National Institutes of Health [AG017628]; SCOR [HL060287]; HFSP [RGSP/2005]; Medical Research Council (UK); European Union [LSHB-CT-2006-037189]; Fondation Leducq [06CVD02, CIHR84256]; UK Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council","We thank A.

Type I neurons make up 90-95% of the cochlear nerve and contact single inner hair cells to provide acoustic analysis as we know it. In contrast, the far less numerous type II neurons arborize extensively among outer hair cells (OHCs)(1,2) and supporting cells(3,4). Their scarcity and smaller calibre axons have made them the subject of much speculation, but little experimental progress for the past 50 years. Here we record from type II fibres near their terminal arbors under OHCs to show that they receive excitatory glutamatergic synaptic input. The type II peripheral arbor conducts action potentials, but the small and infrequent glutamatergic excitation indicates a requirement for strong acoustic stimulation. Furthermore, we show that type II neurons are excited by ATP. Exogenous ATP depolarized type II neurons, both directly and by evoking glutamatergic synaptic input(5). These results prove that type II neurons function as cochlear afferents, and can be modulated by ATP. The lesser magnitude of synaptic drive dictates a fundamentally different role in auditory signalling from that of type I afferents.","[Weisz, Catherine; Glowatzki, Elisabeth; Fuchs, Paul] Johns Hopkins Univ, Sch Med, Dept Neurosci, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA; [Glowatzki, Elisabeth; Fuchs, Paul] Johns Hopkins Univ, Sch Med, Dept Otolaryngol Head & Neck Surg, Ctr Hearing & Balance, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA; [Glowatzki, Elisabeth; Fuchs, Paul] Johns Hopkins Univ, Sch Med, Ctr Sensory Biol, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA","Fuchs, P (reprint author), Johns Hopkins Univ, Sch Med, Dept Neurosci, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA.",pfuchs1@jhmi.edu,,"Weisz, Catherine/0000-0002-2595-835X","NIDCD [R01 DC000276, R01 DC006476, T32 DC000023]; Blaustein Pain Foundation of Johns Hopkins","Supported by NIDCD grants R01 DC000276 and R01 DC006476, T32 DC000023 and a grant from the Blaustein Pain Foundation of Johns Hopkins.",,30,62,63,1,10,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,22-Oct,2009,461,7267,,,,,1126,U226,,10.1038/nature08487,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,509BU,WOS:000270987600045,19847265,No,,,11/20/17

However, it remains unclear how a host genome can survive a rapid burst of hundreds or thousands of insertions because such bursts are exceedingly rare in nature and therefore difficult to observe in real time(2). In a previous study we reported that in a few rice strains the DNA transposon mPing was increasing its copy number by similar to 40 per plant per generation(3). Here we exploit the completely sequenced rice genome to determine 1,664 insertion sites using high-throughput sequencing of 24 individual rice plants and assess the impact of insertion on the expression of 710 genes by comparative microarray analysis. We find that the vast majority of transposable element insertions either upregulate or have no detectable effect on gene transcription. This modest impact reflects a surprising avoidance of exon insertions by mPing and a preference for insertion into 5' flanking sequences of genes. Furthermore, we document the generation of new regulatory networks by a subset of mPing insertions that render adjacent genes stress inducible. As such, this study provides evidence for models first proposed previously(4-6) for the involvement of transposable elements and other repetitive sequences in genome restructuring and gene regulation.","[Naito, Ken; Zhang, Feng; Hancock, C.

This mechanism results in the enhancement of outcrossing and promotes genetic variability, the consequences of which are advantageous to the evolution of a species(3). In melon, sexual forms are controlled by identity of the alleles at the andromonoecious (a) and gynoecious (g) loci(4). We previously showed that the a gene encodes an ethylene biosynthesis enzyme, CmACS-7, that represses stamen development in female flowers(5). Here we show that the transition from male to female flowers in gynoecious lines results from epigenetic changes in the promoter of a transcription factor, CmWIP1. This natural and heritable epigenetic change resulted from the insertion of a transposon, which is required for initiation and maintenance of the spreading of DNA methylation to the CmWIP1 promoter. Expression of CmWIP1 leads to carpel abortion, resulting in the development of unisexual male flowers. Moreover, we show that CmWIP1 indirectly represses the expression of the andromonoecious gene, CmACS-7, to allow stamen development. Together our data indicate a model in which CmACS-7 and CmWIP1 interact to control the development of male, female and hermaphrodite flowers in melon.","[Martin, Antoine; Troadec, Christelle; Boualem, Adnane; Rajab, Mazen; Fernandez, Ronan; Bendahmane, Abdelhafid] INRA, CNRS, UMR1165, Unite Rech Genom Vegetale, F-91057 Evry, France; [Morin, Halima] INRA, Inst Jean Pierre Bourgin, F-78026 Versailles, France; [Pitrat, Michel; Dogimont, Catherine] INRA, UR 1052, Unite Genet & Ameliorat Fruits & Legumes, F-84143 Montfavet, France","Bendahmane, A (reprint author), INRA, CNRS, UMR1165, Unite Rech Genom Vegetale, 2 Rue Gaston Cremieux, F-91057 Evry, France.",bendahm@evry.inra.fr,,"Boualem, Adnane/0000-0003-4428-6496",GAP department,"We thank D.

The structural variability of aromatic products of fungal nonreducing, multidomain iterative polyketide synthases (NR-PKS group of IPKSs) results from regiospecific cyclizations of reactive poly-beta-keto intermediates(1-3). How poly-beta-keto species are synthesized and stabilized, how their chain lengths are determined, and, in particular, how specific cyclization patterns are controlled have been largely inaccessible and functionally unknown until recently(4). A product template (PT) domain is responsible for controlling specific aldol cyclization and aromatization of these mature polyketide precursors, but the mechanistic basis is unknown. Here we present the 1.8 angstrom crystal structure and mutational studies of a dissected PT monodomain from PksA, the NR-PKS that initiates the biosynthesis of the potent hepatocarcinogen aflatoxin B(1) in Aspergillus parasiticus. Despite having minimal sequence similarity to known enzymes, the structure displays a distinct `double hot dog' (DHD) fold. Co-crystal structures with palmitate or a bicyclic substrate mimic illustrate that PT can bind both linear and bicyclic polyketides. Docking and mutagenesis studies reveal residues important for substrate binding and catalysis, and identify a phosphopantetheine localization channel and a deep two-part interior binding pocket and reaction chamber. Sequence similarity and extensive conservation of active site residues in PT domains suggest that the mechanistic insights gleaned from these studies will prove general for this class of IPKSs, and lay a foundation for defining the molecular rules controlling NR-PKS cyclization specificity.","[Crawford, Jason M.; Labonte, Jason W.; Vagstad, Anna L.; Hill, Eric A.; Townsend, Craig A.] Johns Hopkins Univ, Dept Chem, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA; [Townsend, Craig A.] Johns Hopkins Univ, Dept Biol, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA; [Townsend, Craig A.] Johns Hopkins Univ, Dept Biophys, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA; [Korman, Tyler P.; Tsai, Shiou-Chuan] Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Mol Biol & Biochem, Irvine, CA 92697 USA; [Kamari-Bidkorpeh, Oliver; Tsai, Shiou-Chuan] Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Chem, Irvine, CA 92697 USA; [Tsai, Shiou-Chuan] Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Pharmaceut Sci, Irvine, CA 92697 USA","Townsend, CA (reprint author), Johns Hopkins Univ, Dept Chem, Charles & 34Th St, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA.",sctsai@uci.edu; ctownsend@jhu.edu,"Tsai, Shiou-Chuan/C-1188-2010",,"US National Institutes of Health [ES001670]; Pew Foundation; Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory (SSRL); Stanford University on behalf of the US Department of Energy, Office of Basic Energy Sciences; Director, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, of the US Department of Energy [DE-AC02-05CH11231]; Damon Runyon Cancer Research Foundation [DRG-2002-09]","We thank T.

Nucleotide modifications are incorporated at different stages of tRNA processing, after the RNA molecule adopts the proper conformation. In bacteria, tRNA(Ile2) lysidine synthetase (TilS) modifies cytidine into lysidine (L; 2-lysyl-cytidine) at the first anticodon of tRNA(Ile2) (refs 4-9). This modification switches tRNA(Ile2) from a methionine-specific to an isoleucine-specific tRNA(9). However, the aminoacylation of tRNA(Ile2) by methionyl-tRNA synthetase (MetRS), before the modification by TilS, might lead to the misincorporation of methionine in response to isoleucine codons. The mechanism used by bacteria to avoid this pitfall is unknown. Here we show that the TilS enzyme specifically recognizes and modifies tRNA(Ile2) in its precursor form, thereby avoiding translation errors. We identified the lysidine modification in pre-tRNA(Ile2) isolated from RNase-Edeficient Escherichia coli and did not detect mature tRNA(Ile2) lacking this modification. Our kinetic analyses revealed that TilS can modify both types of RNA molecule with comparable efficiencies. X-ray crystallography and mutational analyses revealed that TilS specifically recognizes the entire L-shape structure in pre-tRNA(Ile2) through extensive interactions coupled with sequential domain movements. Our results demonstrate how TilS prevents the recognition of tRNA(Ile2) by MetRS and achieves high specificity for its substrate. These two key points form the basis for maintaining the fidelity of isoleucine codon translation in bacteria. Our findings also provide a rationale for the necessity of incorporating specific modifications at the precursor level during tRNA biogenesis.","[Nakanishi, Kotaro; Nureki, Osamu] Tokyo Inst Technol, Dept Biol Informat, Grad Sch Biosci & Biotechnol, Kanagawa 2258501, Japan; [Bonnefond, Luc; Ishitani, Ryuichiro; Nureki, Osamu] Univ Tokyo, Inst Med Sci, Dept Basic Med Sci, Minato Ku, Tokyo 1088639, Japan; [Kimura, Satoshi; Suzuki, Tsutomu] Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Engn, Dept Chem & Biotechnol, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo 1138656, Japan","Nureki, O (reprint author), Tokyo Inst Technol, Dept Biol Informat, Grad Sch Biosci & Biotechnol, Kanagawa 2258501, Japan.",nureki@ims.u-tokyo.ac.jp,"Suzuki, Tsutomu/J-1776-2015; Bonnefond, Luc/P-3926-2016","Suzuki, Tsutomu/0000-0002-9731-1731; Bonnefond, Luc/0000-0002-1164-742X","SORST program grant from Japan Science and Technology; Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT); Mitsubishi Foundation; Kurata Memorial Hitachi Science and Technology Foundation; Japan Society for the Promotion of Science","We thank the beamline staff at BL41XU of SPring-8 (Harima, Japan) and NW12 of PF-AR (Tsukuba, Japan) for help during data collection.

To examine the mechanisms underlying hippocampal coding, here we measured the intracellular dynamics of place cells by combining in vivo whole-cell recordings with a virtual-reality system. Head-restrained mice, running on a spherical treadmill, interacted with a computer-generated visual environment to perform spatial behaviours. Robust place-cell activity was present during movement along a virtual linear track. From whole-cell recordings, we identified three subthreshold signatures of place fields: an asymmetric ramp-like depolarization of the baseline membrane potential, an increase in the amplitude of intracellular theta oscillations, and a phase precession of the intracellular theta oscillation relative to the extracellularly recorded theta rhythm. These intracellular dynamics underlie the primary features of place-cell rate and temporal codes. The virtual-reality system developed here will enable new experimental approaches to study the neural circuits underlying navigation.","[Harvey, Christopher D.; Collman, Forrest; Dombeck, Daniel A.; Tank, David W.] Princeton Univ, Princeton Neurosci Inst, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Harvey, Christopher D.; Collman, Forrest; Dombeck, Daniel A.; Tank, David W.] Princeton Univ, Lewis Sigler Inst Integrat Gen, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Harvey, Christopher D.; Collman, Forrest; Dombeck, Daniel A.; Tank, David W.] Princeton Univ, Dept Mol Biol, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA","Tank, DW (reprint author), Princeton Univ, Princeton Neurosci Inst, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA.",dwtank@princeton.edu,,,"NIH [1R01MH083686-01, 5R01MH060651-09]; Helen Hay Whitney Fellowship; Patterson Trust Fellowship","We thank E.

Whereas differentiating cells leave the VZ to constitute the future neocortex, renewing radial glia progenitors stay in the VZ for subsequent divisions. The differential behaviour of progenitors and their differentiating progeny is essential for neocortical development; however, the mechanisms that ensure these behavioural differences are unclear. Here we show that asymmetric centrosome inheritance regulates the differential behaviour of renewing progenitors and their differentiating progeny in the embryonic mouse neocortex. Centrosome duplication in dividing radial glia progenitors generates a pair of centrosomes with differently aged mother centrioles. During peak phases of neurogenesis, the centrosome retaining the old mother centriole stays in the VZ and is preferentially inherited by radial glia progenitors, whereas the centrosome containing the new mother centriole mostly leaves the VZ and is largely associated with differentiating cells. Removal of ninein, a mature centriole-specific protein, disrupts the asymmetric segregation and inheritance of the centrosome and causes premature depletion of progenitors from the VZ. These results indicate that preferential inheritance of the centrosome with the mature older mother centriole is required for maintaining radial glia progenitors in the developing mammalian neocortex.","[Wang, Xiaoqun; Imai, Janice H.; Shi, Song-Hai] Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Dev Biol Program, New York, NY 10021 USA; [Tsai, Jin-Wu; Lian, Wei-Nan; Vallee, Richard B.] Columbia Univ, Dept Pathol, New York, NY 10032 USA; [Tsai, Jin-Wu; Lian, Wei-Nan; Vallee, Richard B.] Columbia Univ, Dept Cell Biol, New York, NY 10032 USA; [Imai, Janice H.; Shi, Song-Hai] Weill Cornell Med Coll, BCMB Allied Program, New York, NY 10065 USA","Shi, SH (reprint author), Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Dev Biol Program, 1275 York Ave, New York, NY 10021 USA.",shis@mskcc.org,,,March of Dimes Birth Defects Foundation; Whitehall Foundation; Dana Foundation; Autism Speaks Foundation; Klingenstein Foundation; NARSAD; NIH,"We thank A.

In contrast, the transport of magnetic charges has barely been explored experimentally, mainly because magnetic charges, in contrast to electric ones, are generally considered at best to be convenient macroscopic parameters(1,2), rather than well-defined quasiparticles. However, it was recently proposed that magnetic charges can exist in certain materials in the form of emergent excitations that manifest like point charges, or magnetic monopoles(3). Here we address the question of whether such magnetic charges and their associated currents-'magnetricity'-can be measured directly in experiment, without recourse to any material-specific theory. By mapping the problem onto Onsager's theory of electrolytes(4), we show that this is indeed possible, and devise an appropriate method for the measurement of magnetic charges and their dynamics. Using muon spin rotation as a suitable local probe, we apply the method to a real material, the 'spin ice' Dy(2)Ti(2)O(7) (refs 5-8). Our experimental measurements prove that magnetic charges exist in this material, interact via a Coulomb potential, and have measurable currents. We further characterize deviations from Ohm's law, and determine the elementary unit of magnetic charge to be 5 mu(B) angstrom(-1), which is equal to that recently predicted using the microscopic theory of spin ice(3). Our measurement of magnetic charge and magnetic current establishes an instance of a perfect symmetry between electricity and magnetism.","[Bramwell, S.

A fundamental route for the exploration of such phenomena is the generation of Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) pairs(1) of quantum-entangled objects for the test of so-called Bell inequalities(2). Whereas such experimental tests of non-locality have been successfully conducted with pairwise entangled photons, it has not yet been possible to realize an electronic analogue of it in the solid state, where spin-1/2 mobile electrons are the natural quantum objects(3). The difficulty stems from the fact that electrons are immersed in a macroscopic ground state-the Fermi sea-which prevents the straightforward generation and splitting of entangled pairs of electrons on demand. A superconductor, however, could act as a source of EPR pairs of electrons, because its ground-state is composed of Cooper pairs in a spin-singlet state(4). These Cooper pairs can be extracted from a superconductor by tunnelling, but, to obtain an efficient EPR source of entangled electrons, the splitting of the Cooper pairs into separate electrons has to be enforced. This can be achieved by having the electrons 'repel' each other by Coulomb interaction(5). Controlled Cooper pair splitting can thereby be realized by coupling of the superconductor to two normal metal drain contacts by means of individually tunable quantum dots. Here we demonstrate the first experimental realization of such a tunable Cooper pair splitter, which shows a surprisingly high efficiency. Our findings open a route towards a first test of the EPR paradox and Bell inequalities in the solid state.","[Hofstetter, L.; Csonka, S.; Schoenenberger, C.] Univ Basel, Dept Phys, CH-4056 Basel, Switzerland; [Csonka, S.] Budapest Univ Technol & Econ, Dept Phys, H-1111 Budapest, Hungary; [Nygard, J.] Univ Copenhagen, Niels Bohr Inst, Nanosci Ctr, DK-2100 Copenhagen, Denmark","Schonenberger, C (reprint author), Univ Basel, Dept Phys, Klingelbergstr 82, CH-4056 Basel, Switzerland.",csonka@dept.phy.bme.hu; christian.schoenenberger@unibas.ch,"Csonka, Szabolcs/A-5348-2013; Nygard, Jesper/F-5113-2014; Schonenberger, Christian/N-3187-2017","Nygard, Jesper/0000-0002-4639-5314; Schonenberger, Christian/0000-0002-5652-460X",Swiss National Science Foundation; Swiss National Center of Competence in Research on Nanoscale Science; Danish Natural Science Research Council; Hungarian Scientific Research Fund [NNF 78842]; European Union [41139],"We thank G.

Quasi-crystals permit symmetry operations forbidden in classical crystallography, for example five-, eight-, ten-and 12-fold rotations, yet have sharp diffraction peaks. Intermetallic compounds have been observed to form both metastable and energetically stabilized quasicrystals(1,3,5); quasicrystalline order has also been reported for the tantalum telluride phase with an approximate Ta(1.6)Te composition(6). Later, quasicrystals were discovered in soft matter, namely supramolecular structures of organic dendrimers(7) and tri-block copolymers(8), and micrometre-sized colloidal spheres have been arranged into quasicrystalline arrays by using intense laser beams that create quasi-periodic optical standing-wave patterns(9). Here we show that colloidal inorganic nanoparticles can self-assemble into binary aperiodic superlattices. We observe formation of assemblies with dodecagonal quasicrystalline order in different binary nanoparticle systems: 13.4-nm Fe(2)O(3) and 5-nm Au nanocrystals, 12.6-nm Fe(3)O(4) and 4.7-nm Au nanocrystals, and 9-nm PbS and 3-nm Pd nanocrystals. Such compositional flexibility indicates that the formation of quasicrystalline nanoparticle assemblies does not require a unique combination of interparticle interactions, but is a general sphere-packing phenomenon governed by the entropy and simple interparticle potentials. We also find that dodecagonal quasicrystalline superlattices can form low-defect interfaces with ordinary crystalline binary superlattices, using fragments of (3(3).4(2)) Archimedean tiling as the 'wetting layer' between the periodic and aperiodic phases.","[Talapin, Dmitri V.; Bodnarchuk, Maryna I.] Univ Chicago, Dept Chem, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Talapin, Dmitri V.; Shevchenko, Elena V.] Argonne Natl Lab, Ctr Nanoscale Mat, Argonne, IL 60439 USA; [Ye, Xingchen; Murray, Christopher B.] Univ Penn, Dept Chem, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Chen, Jun; Murray, Christopher B.] Univ Penn, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA","Talapin, DV (reprint author), Univ Chicago, Dept Chem, 5735 S Ellis Ave, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.",dvtalapin@uchicago.edu; eshevchenko@anl.gov,"Chen, Jun/F-7103-2014; Ye, Xingchen/D-3202-2017","Ye, Xingchen/0000-0001-6851-2721","US National Science Foundation (NSF) [DMR-0847535, DMR-0213745]; Austrian Nanoinitiative; Center for Nanoscale Materials; Argonne National Laboratory; US Department of Energy [DE-AC02-06CH11357]","We thank S.

Efficient chemo-enzymatic methods for the synthesis of enantioenriched alpha-amino acids have been developed, but it is still a challenge to obtain non-naturalamino acids(6,7). Alkene hydrogenation is broadly useful for the enantioselective catalytic synthesis of many classes of amino acids(8,9), but it is not possible to obtain zeta-amino acids bearing aryl or quaternary alkyl alpha-substituents using this method. The Strecker synthesis-the reaction of an imine or imine equivalent with hydrogen cyanide, followed by nitrile hydrolysis-is an especially versatile chemical method for the synthesis of racemic alpha-amino acids(10,11). Asymmetric Strecker syntheses using stoichiometric amounts of a chiral reagent have been applied successfully on gram-to-kilogram scales, yielding enantiomerically enriched alpha-amino acids(12-14). In principle, Strecker syntheses employing sub-stoichiometric quantities of a chiral reagent could provide a practical alternative to these approaches, but the reported catalytic asymmetric methods have seen limited use on preparative scales (more than a gram)(15,16). The limited utility of existing catalytic methods may be due to several important factors, including the relatively complex and precious nature of the catalysts and the requisite use of hazardous cyanide sources. Here we report a new catalytic asymmetric method for the syntheses of highly enantiomerically enriched non-natural amino acids using a simple chiral amido-thiourea catalyst to control the key hydrocyanation step. This catalyst is robust, without sensitive functional groups, so it is compatible with aqueous cyanide salts, which are safer and easier to handle than other cyanide sources; this makes the method adaptable to large-scale synthesis. We have used this new method to obtain enantiopure amino acids that are not readily prepared by enzymatic methods or by chemical hydrogenation.","[Zuend, Stephan J.; Coughlin, Matthew P.; Lalonde, Mathieu P.; Jacobsen, Eric N.] Harvard Univ, Dept Chem & Chem Biol, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA","Jacobsen, EN (reprint author), Harvard Univ, Dept Chem & Chem Biol, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",jacobsen@chemistry.harvard.edu,,,NIH; American Chemical Society and Roche; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada,"This work was supported by the NIH, and through fellowships from the American Chemical Society and Roche (to S.

Globally, ice losses contribute similar to 1.8 mm yr(-1) (ref. 8), but this could increase if the retreat of ice shelves and tidewater glaciers further enhances the loss of grounded ice(9) or initiates the large-scale collapse of vulnerable parts of the ice sheets(10). Ice loss as a result of accelerated flow, known as dynamic thinning, is so poorly understood that its potential contribution to sea level over the twenty-first century remains unpredictable(11). Thinning on the ice-sheet scale has been monitored by using repeat satellite altimetry observations to track small changes in surface elevation, but previous sensors could not resolve most fast-flowing coastal glaciers(12). Here we report the use of high-resolution ICESat (Ice, Cloud and land Elevation Satellite) laser altimetry to map change along the entire grounded margins of the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets. To isolate the dynamic signal, we compare rates of elevation change from both fast-flowing and slow-flowing ice with those expected from surface mass-balance fluctuations. We find that dynamic thinning of glaciers now reaches all latitudes in Greenland, has intensified on key Antarctic grounding lines, has endured for decades after ice-shelf collapse, penetrates far into the interior of each ice sheet and is spreading as ice shelves thin by ocean-driven melt. In Greenland, glaciers flowing faster than 100 m yr(-1) thinned at an average rate of 0.84 m yr(-1), and in the Amundsen Sea embayment of Antarctica, thinning exceeded 9.0 m yr(-1) for some glaciers. Our results show that the most profound changes in the ice sheets currently result from glacier dynamics at ocean margins.","[Pritchard, Hamish D.; Arthern, Robert J.; Vaughan, David G.] British Antarctic Survey, NERC, Cambridge CB3 0ET, England; [Edwards, Laura A.] Univ Bristol, Sch Geog Sci, Bristol BS8 1SS, Avon, England","Pritchard, HD (reprint author), British Antarctic Survey, NERC, Madingley Rd, Cambridge CB3 0ET, England.",hprit@bas.ac.uk,"Vaughan, David/C-8348-2011",,UK Natural Environment Research Council,We are extremely grateful to the ICESat science team and all those at NASA involved in producing the ICESat data products distributed through the US National Snow and Ice Data Center.

Here we report oligotrophic ammonia oxidation kinetics and cellular characteristics of the mesophilic crenarchaeon 'Candidatus Nitrosopumilus maritimus' strain SCM1. Unlike characterized ammonia-oxidizing bacteria, SCM1 is adapted to life under extreme nutrient limitation, sustaining high specific oxidation rates at ammonium concentrations found in open oceans. Its half-saturation constant (K(m) = 133 nM total ammonium) and substrate threshold (<= 10 nM) closely resemble kinetics of in situ nitrification in marine systems(9,10) and directly link ammonia-oxidizing Archaea to oligotrophic nitrification. The remarkably high specific affinity for reduced nitrogen (68,700 l per g cells per h) of SCM1 suggests that Nitrosopumilus-like ammonia-oxidizing Archaea could successfully compete with heterotrophic bacterio-plankton and phytoplankton. Together these findings support the hypothesis that nitrification is more prevalent in the marine nitrogen cycle than accounted for in current biogeochemical models(11).","[Martens-Habbena, Willm; Berube, Paul M.; Urakawa, Hidetoshi; de la Torre, Jose R.; Stahl, David A.] Univ Washington, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Seattle, WA 98105 USA","Martens-Habbena, W (reprint author), Univ Washington, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Seattle, WA 98105 USA.",willmmh@u.washington.edu; dastahl@u.washington.edu,"de la Torre, Jose/H-2081-2012; Martens-Habbena, Willm/I-7656-2013; Urakawa, Hidetoshi/B-1337-2013","Martens-Habbena, Willm/0000-0002-8495-9125; Urakawa, Hidetoshi/0000-0003-3748-6027","NSF [MCB-0604448, OCE-0623174]","We thank A.

Here we show that the presence of a cheater in a population of randomly mutated social amoebae can select for cheater-resistance. Furthermore, we show that this cheater-resistance can be a noble strategy because the resister strain does not necessarily exploit other strains. Thus, the evolution of resisters may be instrumental in preserving cooperative behaviour in the face of cheating.","[Khare, Anupama; Santorelli, Lorenzo A.; Kuspa, Adam; Shaulsky, Gad] Baylor Coll Med, Dept Mol & Human Genet, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Santorelli, Lorenzo A.; Strassmann, Joan E.; Queller, David C.; Kuspa, Adam; Shaulsky, Gad] Rice Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Houston, TX 77005 USA; [Kuspa, Adam] Baylor Coll Med, Dept Biochem & Mol Biol, Houston, TX 77030 USA","Shaulsky, G (reprint author), Baylor Coll Med, Dept Mol & Human Genet, 1 Baylor Plaza, Houston, TX 77030 USA.",gadi@bcm.edu,,"Kuspa, Adam/0000-0002-9156-149X; Shaulsky, Gad/0000-0002-0532-0551; Strassmann, Joan/0000-0003-0638-8440",National Science Foundation; Cullen Foundation,This work was supported by a grant from the National Science Foundation.

Even in the most linguistically impoverished environments, children naturally develop sophisticated language systems(3). In contrast, reading is a learnt skill that does not develop without intensive tuition and practice. Learning to read is likely to involve ontogenic structural brain changes(4-6), but these are nearly impossible to isolate in children owing to concurrent biological, environmental and social maturational changes. In Colombia, guerrillas are re-integrating into mainstream society and learning to read for the first time as adults. This presents a unique opportunity to investigate how literacy changes the brain, without the maturational complications present in children. Here we compare structural brain scans from those who learnt to read as adults (late-literates) with those from a carefully matched set of illiterates. Late-literates had more white matter in the splenium of the corpus callosum and more grey matter in bilateral angular, dorsal occipital, middle temporal, left supramarginal and superior temporal gyri. The importance of these brain regions for skilled reading was investigated in early literates, who learnt to read as children. We found anatomical connections linking the left and right angular and dorsal occipital gyri through the area of the corpus callosum where white matter was higher in late-literates than in illiterates; that reading, relative to object naming, increased the interhemispheric functional connectivity between the left and right angular gyri; and that activation in the left angular gyrus exerts top-down modulation on information flow from the left dorsal occipital gyrus to the left supramarginal gyrus. These findings demonstrate how the regions identified in late-literates interact during reading, relative to object naming, in early literates.","[Carreiras, Manuel] Basque Ctr Cognit Brain & Language, Donostia San Sebastian 20009, Spain; [Carreiras, Manuel] Basque Fdn Sci, IKERBASQUE, Bilbao 48011, Spain; [Carreiras, Manuel] Univ Basque Country, Dept Filol Vasca, Bilbao 48940, Spain; [Carreiras, Manuel; Estevez, Adelina] Univ La Laguna, Tenerife 38055, Spain; [Seghier, Mohamed L.; Price, Cathy J.] UCL, Inst Neurol, Wellcome Trust Ctr Neuroimaging, London WC1N 3BG, England; [Baquero, Silvia; Lozano, Alfonso] Univ Nacl Colombia, Bogota 3165000, Colombia; [Devlin, Joseph T.] UCL, London WC1E 6BT, England","Carreiras, M (reprint author), Basque Ctr Cognit Brain & Language, Donostia San Sebastian 20009, Spain.",m.carreiras@bcbl.eu; c.price@fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk,"Seghier, Mohamed/C-6314-2009; Carreiras, Manuel/D-5267-2009; BCBL, BCBL/N-6864-2017","Seghier, Mohamed/0000-0002-1146-8800; Carreiras, Manuel/0000-0001-6726-7613; BCBL, BCBL/0000-0002-8345-6892; Devlin, Joseph/0000-0001-9737-3070",Spanish Ministry of Education and Science; Wellcome Trust,"We thank K.

Cuticular hydrocarbon signals are used by insects, including Drosophila melanogaster, to distinguish conspecific individuals from others(1-3). These chemicals also contribute to intraspecific courtship and mating interactions(1-3). However, the possibility that sex and species identification are linked by common chemical signalling mechanisms has not been formally tested. Here we provide direct evidence that a single compound is used to communicate female identity among D. melanogaster, and to define a reproductive isolation barrier between D. melanogaster and sibling species. A transgenic manipulation eliminated cuticular hydrocarbons by ablating the oenocytes, specialized cells required for the expression of these chemical signals. The resulting oenocyte-less (oe(-)) females elicited the normal repertoire of courtship behaviours from males, but were actually preferred over wild-type females by courting males. In addition, wild-type males attempted to copulate with oe(-) males. Thus, flies lacking hydrocarbons are a sexual hyperstimulus. Treatment of virgin females with the aversive male pheromone cis-vaccenyl acetate (cVA) significantly delayed mating of oe(-) females compared to wild-type females. This difference was eliminated when oe(-) females were treated with a blend of cVA and the female aphrodisiac (7Z,11Z)-heptacosadiene (7,11-HD), showing that female aphrodisiac compounds can attenuate the effects of male aversive pheromones. 7,11-HD also was shown to have a crucial role in heterospecific encounters. Specifically, the species barrier was lost because males of other Drosophila species courted oe(-) D. melanogaster females, and D. simulans males consistently mated with them. Treatment of oe(-) females with 7,11-HD restored the species barrier, showing that a single compound can confer species identity. These results identify a common mechanism for sexual and species recognition regulated by cuticular hydrocarbons.","[Billeter, Jean-Christophe; Atallah, Jade; Krupp, Joshua J.; Levine, Joel D.] Univ Toronto, Dept Biol, Mississauga, ON L5L 1C6, Canada; [Millar, Jocelyn G.] Univ Calif Riverside, Dept Entomol, Riverside, CA 92521 USA","Levine, JD (reprint author), Univ Toronto, Dept Biol, 3359 Mississauga Rd, Mississauga, ON L5L 1C6, Canada.",joel.levine@utoronto.ca,"Billeter, Jean-Christophe/G-5399-2012",,Swiss National Science Foundation; Canadian Institutes of Health Research; Canada Research Chair,"We thank H.

Diverse molecular systems have evolved to localize receptors at synapses, but in most cases, they rely on scaffolding proteins localized below the plasma membrane(1-3). A few systems have been suggested to control the synaptic localization of neurotransmitter receptors through extracellular interactions, such as the pentraxins that bind AMPA receptors and trigger their aggregation(4). However, it is not yet clear whether these systems have a central role in the organization of postsynaptic domains in vivo or rather provide modulatory functions(5). Here we describe an extracellular scaffold that is necessary to cluster acetylcholine receptors at neuromuscular junctions in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. It involves the ectodomain of the previously identified transmembrane protein LEV-10 (ref. 6) and a novel extracellular protein, LEV-9. LEV-9 is secreted by the muscle cells and localizes at cholinergic neuromuscular junctions. Acetylcholine receptors, LEV-9 and LEV-10 are interdependent for proper synaptic localization and physically interact based on biochemical evidence. Notably, the function of LEV-9 relies on eight complement control protein (CCP) domains. These domains, also called 'sushi domains', are usually found in proteins regulating complement activity in the vertebrate immune system(7). Because the complement system does not exist in protostomes, our results suggest that some of the numerous uncharacterized CCP proteins expressed in the mammalian brain might be directly involved in the organization of the synapse, independently from immune functions.","[Gendrel, Marie; Rapti, Georgia; Bessereau, Jean-Louis] ENS, Dept Biol, F-75005 Paris, France; [Gendrel, Marie; Rapti, Georgia; Bessereau, Jean-Louis] INSERM, U789, F-75005 Paris, France; [Richmond, Janet E.] Univ Illinois, Dept Biol, Chicago, IL 60607 USA","Bessereau, JL (reprint author), ENS, Dept Biol, F-75005 Paris, France.",jlbesse@biologie.ens.fr,"Bessereau, Jean-Louis/M-2988-2017","Bessereau, Jean-Louis/0000-0002-3088-7621; Gendrel, Marie/0000-0002-0991-0479",Ministere de la Recherche; Association Francaise contre les Myopathies; Ministere de la Recherche fellow; INSERM Avenir; Agence Nationale de la Recherche [ANR-07-NEURO-032-01]; NIH [RO1 MH073156],"We thank E.

However, the inverse challenge of using light to control precisely cellular behaviour has only recently begun to be addressed; semi-synthetic chromophore-tethered receptors(1) and naturally occurring channel rhodopsins have been used to perturb directly neuronal networks(2,3). The difficulty of engineering light-sensitive proteins remains a significant impediment to the optical control of most cell-biological processes. Here we demonstrate the use of a new genetically encoded light-control system based on an optimized, reversible protein-protein interaction from the phytochrome signalling network of Arabidopsis thaliana. Because protein-protein interactions are one of the most general currencies of cellular information, this system can, in principle, be generically used to control diverse functions. Here we show that this system can be used to translocate target proteins precisely and reversibly to the membrane with micrometre spatial resolution and at the second timescale. We show that light-gated translocation of the upstream activators of Rho-family GTPases, which control the actin cytoskeleton, can be used to precisely reshape and direct the cell morphology of mammalian cells. The light-gated protein-protein interaction that has been optimized here should be useful for the design of diverse light-programmable reagents, potentially enabling a new generation of perturbative, quantitative experiments in cell biology.","[Levskaya, Anselm; Weiner, Orion D.; Lim, Wendell A.; Voigt, Christopher A.] Univ Calif San Francisco, UCB NIH Nanomed Dev Ctr, Cell Prop Lab, San Francisco, CA 94158 USA; [Levskaya, Anselm] Univ Calif San Francisco, Grad Program Biophys, San Francisco, CA 94158 USA; [Levskaya, Anselm; Voigt, Christopher A.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Pharmaceut Chem, San Francisco, CA 94158 USA; [Weiner, Orion D.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Cardiovasc Res Inst, San Francisco, CA 94158 USA; [Lim, Wendell A.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Howard Hughes Med Inst, San Francisco, CA 94158 USA; [Lim, Wendell A.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Cellular & Mol Pharmacol, San Francisco, CA 94158 USA","Lim, WA (reprint author), Univ Calif San Francisco, UCB NIH Nanomed Dev Ctr, Cell Prop Lab, San Francisco, CA 94158 USA.",lim@cmp.ucsf.edu,"Weiner, Orion/F-2576-2011; Xu, Yunjian/A-2036-2012","Weiner, Orion/0000-0002-1778-6543; ","NSFGR; NIH [R01 GM084040, GM55040, GM62583, EY016546, NIH AI067699, NSF BES-0547637]; Searles Scholar Award; Packard Fellowship; Howard Hughes Medical Institute; Pew Fellowship; Office of Naval Research; UC-Discovery; SynBERC NSF ERC","We thank B.

Integrin binding to extracellular matrix catalyses assembly of multiprotein complexes, which transduce mechanical and chemical signals that regulate many aspects of cell physiology(1,2). Integrin-linked kinase (Ilk) is a multifunctional protein that binds beta-integrin cytoplasmic domains and regulates actin dynamics by recruiting actin binding regulatory proteins such as alpha-and beta-parvin(3). Ilk has also been shown to possess serine/threonine kinase activity(4) and to phosphorylate signalling proteins such as Akt1 and glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (Gsk3 beta) in mammalian cells(5); however, these functions have been shown by genetic studies(6,7) not to occur in flies and worms. Here we show that mice carrying point mutations in the proposed autophosphorylation site of the putative kinase domain and in the pleckstrin homology domain are normal. In contrast, mice with point mutations in the conserved lysine residue of the potential ATP-binding site of the kinase domain, which mediates Ilk binding to alpha-parvin, die owing to renal agenesis. Similar renal defects occur in alpha-parvin-null mice. Thus, we provide genetic evidence that the kinase activity of Ilk is dispensable for mammalian development; however, an interaction between Ilk and alpha-parvin is critical for kidney development.","[Lange, Anika; Wickstroem, Sara A.; Faessler, Reinhard] Max Planck Inst Biochem, Dept Mol Med, D-82152 Martinsried, Germany; [Jakobson, Madis; Sainio, Kirsi] Univ Helsinki, Inst Biomed Med Biochem & Dev Biol, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland; [Zent, Roy] Vanderbilt Univ Sch Med, Dept Med, Div Nephrol, Nashville, TN 37232 USA; [Zent, Roy] Vet Affairs Hosp, Nashville, TN 37232 USA","Fassler, R (reprint author), Max Planck Inst Biochem, Dept Mol Med, D-82152 Martinsried, Germany.",Faessler@biochem.mpg.de,,,"Sigrid Juselius Foundation; Academy of Finland; Finnish Cultural Foundation; NIDDK [DK065123, DK075594, DK65123]; AHA; Department of Veterans Affairs; Austrian Science Funds [SFB021]; Max Planck Society","We thank M.

However, regulated epigenetic modifications at the DNA level, especially active DNA demethylation, in gene activation are not well understood(3-5). Here we report that DNA methylation/demethylation is hormonally switched to control transcription of the cytochrome p450 27B1 (CYP27B1) gene. Reflecting vitamin-D-mediated transrepression of the CYP27B1 gene by the negative vitamin D response element (nVDRE)(6,7), methylation of CpG sites ((5m)CpG) is induced by vitamin D in this gene promoter. Conversely, treatment with parathyroid hormone, a hormone known to activate the CYP27B1 gene(8), induces active demethylation of the (5m)CpG sites in this promoter. Biochemical purification of a complex associated with the nVDRE-binding protein (VDIR, also known as TCF3)(6,7) identified two DNA methyl-transferases, DNMT1 and DNMT3B, for methylation of CpG sites(9), as well as a DNA glycosylase, MBD4 (ref. 10). Protein-kinase-C-phosphorylated MBD4 by parathyroid hormone stimulation promotes incision of methylated DNA through glycosylase activity(11), and a base-excision repair process seems to complete DNA demethylation in the MBD4-bound promoter. Such parathyroid-hormone- induced DNA demethylation and subsequent transcriptional derepression are impaired in Mbd4(-/-) mice(12). Thus, the present findings suggest that methylation switching at the DNA level contributes to the hormonal control of transcription.","[Kim, Mi-Sun; Matsumoto, Takahiro; Fujiyama, Sally; Shirode, Yuko; Yamaoka, Ikuko; Ohtake, Fumiaki; Kato, Shigeaki] Japan Sci & Technol Agcy, ERATO, Kawaguchisi, Saitama 3320012, Japan; [Kim, Mi-Sun; Kondo, Takeshi; Takada, Ichiro; Youn, Min-Young; Yamamoto, Yoko; Takahashi, Sayuri; Matsumoto, Takahiro; Fujiyama, Sally; Shirode, Yuko; Yamaoka, Ikuko; Kitagawa, Hirochika; Takeyama, Ken-Ichi; Ohtake, Fumiaki; Kato, Shigeaki] Univ Tokyo, Inst Mol & Cellular Biosci, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo 1130032, Japan; [Kim, Mi-Sun; Shibuya, Hiroshi] Tokyo Med & Dent Univ, Med Res Inst, Dept Mol Cell Biol, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo 1138510, Japan; [Kim, Mi-Sun; Shibuya, Hiroshi] Tokyo Med & Dent Univ, Sch Biomed Sci, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo 1138510, Japan","Kato, S (reprint author), Japan Sci & Technol Agcy, ERATO, 4-1-8 Honcho, Kawaguchisi, Saitama 3320012, Japan.",uskato@mail.ecc.u-tokyo.ac.jp,,,"Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology","We thank A.

The gene-silencing activity of the Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) depends on its ability to trimethylate lysine 27 of histone H3 (H3K27) by the catalytic SET domain of the EZH2 subunit, and at least two other subunits of the complex: SUZ12 and EED. Here we show that the carboxy-terminal domain of EED specifically binds to histone tails carrying trimethyl-lysine residues associated with repressive chromatin marks, and that this leads to the allosteric activation of the methyltransferase activity of PRC2. Mutations in EED that prevent it from recognizing repressive trimethyl-lysine marks abolish the activation of PRC2 in vitro and, in Drosophila, reduce global methylation and disrupt development. These findings suggest a model for the propagation of the H3K27me3 mark that accounts for the maintenance of repressive chromatin domains and for the transmission of a histone modification from mother to daughter cells.","[Ohno, Katsuhito; Pirrotta, Vincenzo] Rutgers State Univ, Dept Mol Biol & Biochem, Nelson Labs, Piscataway, NJ 08854 USA; [Margueron, Raphael; Son, Jinsook; Drury, William J., III; Voigt, Philipp; Reinberg, Danny] NYU, Sch Med, Howard Hughes Med Inst, New York, NY 10016 USA; [Margueron, Raphael; Son, Jinsook; Drury, William J., III; Voigt, Philipp; Reinberg, Danny] NYU, Sch Med, Dept Biochem, New York, NY 10016 USA; [Justin, Neil; Sharpe, Miriam L.; Martin, Stephen R.; Taylor, William R.; De Marco, Valeria; Gamblin, Steven J.] MRC Natl Inst Med Res, London NW7 1AA, England","Pirrotta, V (reprint author), Rutgers State Univ, Dept Mol Biol & Biochem, Nelson Labs, 604 Allison Rd, Piscataway, NJ 08854 USA.",pirrotta@biology.rutgers.edu; reinbd01@med.nyu.edu; sgambli@nimr.mrc.ac.uk,"Justin, Neil/E-1774-2011; Margueron, Raphael/B-9996-2015","Margueron, Raphael/0000-0002-9093-7977; Sharpe, Miriam/0000-0002-8936-1595; Gamblin, Steven/0000-0001-5331-639X","Deutsche Akademie der Naturforscher Leopoldina [LPDS 2009-5]; NIH [GM064844, GM37120]; HHMI; MRC; Division of Life Sciences of Rutgers University","We thank D.

In classical physics, chaos is characterized by hypersensitivity of the time evolution of a system to initial conditions. Quantum mechanics does not permit a similar definition owing in part to the uncertainty principle, and in part to the Schrodinger equation, which preserves the overlap between quantum states. This fundamental disconnect poses a challenge to quantum-classical correspondence(1), and has motivated a long-standing search for quantum signatures of classical chaos(2,3). Here we present the experimental realization of a common paradigm for quantum chaos-the quantum kicked top(2,4)- and the observation directly in quantum phase space of dynamics that have a chaotic classical counterpart. Our system is based on the combined electronic and nuclear spin of a single atom and is therefore deep in the quantum regime; nevertheless, we find good correspondence between the quantum dynamics and classical phase space structures. Because chaos is inherently a dynamical phenomenon, special significance attaches to dynamical signatures such as sensitivity to perturbation(1,5) or the generation of entropy(6) and entanglement(7,8), for which only indirect evidence has been available(9- 11). We observe clear differences in the sensitivity to perturbation in chaotic versus regular, non-chaotic regimes, and present experimental evidence for dynamical entanglement as a signature of chaos.","[Chaudhury, S.; Smith, A.; Anderson, B.

In such circumstances, current is carried by electrons along the edges of the system, in so-called chiral edge states (CESs). These are states that, as a consequence of nontrivial topological properties of the bulk electronic band structure, have a unique directionality and are robust against scattering from disorder. Recently, it was theoretically predicted(5-7) that electromagnetic analogues of such electronic edge states could be observed in photonic crystals, which are materials having refractive-index variations with a periodicity comparable to the wavelength of the light passing through them. Here we report the experimental realization and observation of such electromagnetic CESs in a magneto-optical photonic crystal(7) fabricated in the microwave regime. We demonstrate that, like their electronic counterparts(8-13), electromagnetic CESs can travel in only one direction and are very robust against scattering from disorder; we find that even large metallic scatterers placed in the path of the propagating edge modes do not induce reflections. These modes may enable the production of new classes of electromagnetic device and experiments that would be impossible using conventional reciprocal photonic states alone. Furthermore, our experimental demonstration and study of photonic CESs provides strong support for the generalization and application of topological band theories to classical and bosonic systems, and may lead to the realization and observation of topological phenomena in a generally much more controlled and customizable fashion than is typically possible with electronic systems.","[Wang, Zheng; Chong, Yidong; Joannopoulos, J.

By the end of the Eocene epoch (similar to 34 Myr ago), the first major Antarctic ice sheets had appeared(4,5), suggesting that major cooling had taken place. Yet the global transition into this icehouse climate remains poorly constrained, as only a few temperature records are available portraying the Cenozoic climatic evolution of the high southern latitudes. Here we present a uniquely continuous and chronostratigraphically well-calibrated TEX86 record of sea surface temperature (SST) from an ocean sediment core in the East Tasman Plateau (palaeolatitude similar to 65 degrees S). We show that southwest Pacific SSTs rose above presentday tropical values (to similar to 34 degrees C) during the Early Eocene age (similar to 53 Myr ago) and had gradually decreased to about 21 degrees C by the early Late Eocene age (similar to 36 Myr ago). Our results imply that there was almost no latitudinal SST gradient between subequatorial and subpolar regions during the Early Eocene age (55-50 Myr ago). Thereafter, the latitudinal gradient markedly increased. In theory, if Eocene cooling was largely driven by a decrease in atmospheric greenhouse gas concentration(6), additional processes are required to explain the relative stability of tropical SSTs given that there was more significant cooling at higher latitudes.","[Bijl, Peter K.; Sluijs, Appy; Brinkhuis, Henk] Univ Utrecht, Palaeobot & Palynol Lab, Fac Sci, Inst Environm Biol, NL-3584 CD Utrecht, Netherlands; [Reichart, Gert-Jan] Univ Utrecht, Fac Geosci, Dept Geochem, NL-3584 CD Utrecht, Netherlands; [Schouten, Stefan] NIOZ Royal Netherlands Inst Sea Res, Dept Marine Organ Biogeochem, NL-1790 AB Den Burg, Netherlands; [Zachos, James C.] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA; [Zachos, James C.] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Inst Marine Sci, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA","Bijl, PK (reprint author), Univ Utrecht, Palaeobot & Palynol Lab, Fac Sci, Inst Environm Biol, Budapestlaan 4, NL-3584 CD Utrecht, Netherlands.",p.k.bijl@uu.nl,"Zachos, James/A-7674-2008; Brinkhuis, Henk/B-4223-2009; Sluijs, Appy/B-3726-2009","Sluijs, Appy/0000-0003-2382-0215",Utrecht University; Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research; LPP Foundation; US National Science Foundation,"Funding for this research was provided by Utrecht University, the Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research (VICI grant to S.

Our understanding of these events is incomplete, however, owing to the previous lack of directly observed eruptions. Chaiten volcano, in Chile's northern Patagonia, erupted rhyolite magma unexpectedly and explosively on 1 May 2008 (ref. 2). Chaiten residents felt earthquakes about 24 hours before ash fell in their town and the eruption escalated into a Plinian column. Although such brief seismic forewarning of a major explosive basaltic eruption has been documented(3), it is unprecedented for silicic magmas. As precursory volcanic unrest relates to magma migration from the storage region to the surface, the very short pre-eruptive warning at Chaiten probably reflects very rapid magma ascent through the sub-volcanic system. Here we present petrological and experimental data that indicate that the hydrous rhyolite magma at Chaiten ascended very rapidly, with velocities of the order of one metre per second. Such rapid ascent implies a transit time from storage depths greater than five kilometres to the near surface in about four hours. This result has implications for hazard mitigation because the rapidity of ascending rhyolite means that future eruptions may provide little warning.","[Castro, Jonathan M.] Univ Orleans, Univ Tours, CNRS, INSU,Inst Sci Terre Orleans,UMR 6113, F-45071 Orleans 2, France; [Dingwell, Donald B.] Univ Munich, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, D-80333 Munich, Germany","Castro, JM (reprint author), Univ Orleans, Univ Tours, CNRS, INSU,Inst Sci Terre Orleans,UMR 6113, Campus Geosci,1A Rue Ferolleire, F-45071 Orleans 2, France.",jonathan.castro@cnrs-orleans.fr,"Wallace Auerbach, Leslie/A-4606-2011; Dingwell, Donald/A-4724-2011","Dingwell, Donald/0000-0002-3332-789X",Alexander von Humboldt Stiftung; Smithsonian Institution; ERC [202844],"We are grateful for funding from the Alexander von Humboldt Stiftung, the Smithsonian Institution, and ERC grant 202844.

Here we explore the possibility of curing colour blindness using gene therapy in experiments on adult monkeys that had been colour blind since birth. A third type of cone pigment was added to dichromatic retinas, providing the receptoral basis for trichromatic colour vision. This opened a new avenue to explore the requirements for establishing the neural circuits for a new dimension of colour sensation. Classic visual deprivation experiments(1) have led to the expectation that neural connections established during development would not appropriately process an input that was not present from birth. Therefore, it was believed that the treatment of congenital vision disorders would be ineffective unless administered to the very young. However, here we show that the addition of a third opsin in adult red-green colour deficient primates was sufficient to produce trichromatic colour vision behaviour. Thus, trichromacy can arise from a single addition of a third cone class and it does not require an early developmental process. This provides a positive outlook for the potential of gene therapy to cure adult vision disorders.","[Mancuso, Katherine; Kuchenbecker, James A.; Neitz, Jay; Neitz, Maureen] Univ Washington, Dept Ophthalmol, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Hauswirth, William W.; Li, Qiuhong] Univ Florida, Dept Ophthalmol, Gainesville, FL 32610 USA; [Hauswirth, William W.; Li, Qiuhong] Univ Florida, Powell Gene Therapy Ctr, Gainesville, FL 32610 USA; [Connor, Thomas B.; Mauck, Matthew C.] Med Coll Wisconsin, Dept Ophthalmol, Milwaukee, WI 53226 USA","Neitz, J (reprint author), Univ Washington, Dept Ophthalmol, Box 356485,1959 NE Pacific St, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.",jneitz@uw.edu,,"Neitz, Jay/0000-0003-3877-6712","National Institutes of Health [R01EY016861, R01EY11123]; Research Training Program in Vision Science [T32EY014537]; NEI Core Grants [P30EY01931, P30EY01730, P30EY08571]; Harry J.

However, little is known about how the innate immune system is galvanized to respond to DNA-based microbes. Here we show that STING (stimulator of interferon genes) is critical for the induction of IFN by non-CpG intracellular DNA species produced by various DNA pathogens after infection(4). Murine embryonic fibroblasts, as well as antigen presenting cells such as macrophages and dendritic cells (exposed to intracellular B-form DNA, the DNA virus herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) or bacteria Listeria monocytogenes), were found to require STING to initiate effective IFN production. Accordingly, Sting-knockout mice were susceptible to lethal infection after exposure to HSV-1. The importance of STING in facilitating DNA-mediated innate immune responses was further evident because cytotoxic T-cell responses induced by plasmid DNA vaccination were reduced in Sting-deficient animals. In the presence of intracellular DNA, STING relocalized with TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) from the endoplasmic reticulum to perinuclear vesicles containing the exocystcomponent Sec5 (also known as EXOC2). Collectively, our studies indicate that STING is essential for host defence against DNA pathogens such as HSV-1 and facilitates the adjuvant activity of DNA-based vaccines.","[Barber, Glen N.] Univ Miami, Miller Sch Med, Dept Med, Miami, FL 33136 USA; Univ Miami, Miller Sch Med, Sylvester Comprehens Canc Ctr, Miami, FL 33136 USA","Barber, GN (reprint author), Univ Miami, Miller Sch Med, Dept Med, Miami, FL 33136 USA.",gbarber@med.miami.edu,"Ma, Zhe/N-9467-2017","Ma, Zhe/0000-0002-7222-2556",NIH [AI079336],"We thank J.

The biogenesis and function of mitochondria, the energy-generating organelles in eukaryotic cells, are primary longevity determinants. Genetic or pharmacological manipulations of mitochondrial activity profoundly affect the life-span of diverse organisms(2). However, the molecular mechanisms regulating mitochondrial biogenesis and energy metabolism during ageing are poorly understood. Prohibitins are ubiquitous, evolutionarily conserved proteins, which form a ring-like, high-molecular-mass complex at the inner membrane of mitochondria(3). Here, we show that the mitochondrial prohibitin complex promotes longevity by modulating mitochondrial function and fat metabolism in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. We found that prohibitin deficiency shortens the lifespan of otherwise wild-type animals. Notably, knockdown of prohibitin promotes longevity in diapause mutants or under conditions of dietary restriction. In addition, prohibitin deficiency extends the lifespan of animals with compromised mitochondrial function or fat metabolism. Depletion of prohibitin influences ATP levels, animal fat content and mitochondrial proliferation in a genetic-background- and age-specific manner. Together, these findings reveal a novel mechanism regulating mitochondrial biogenesis and function, with opposing effects on energy metabolism, fat utilization and ageing in C. elegans. Prohibitin may have a similar key role in modulating energy metabolism during ageing in mammals.","[Artal-Sanz, Marta; Tavernarakis, Nektarios] Fdn Res & Technol, Inst Mol Biol & Biotechnol, Iraklion 71110, Crete, Greece","Tavernarakis, N (reprint author), Fdn Res & Technol, Inst Mol Biol & Biotechnol, Iraklion 71110, Crete, Greece.",martal@ibv.csic.es; tavernarakis@imbb.forth.gr,"Artal-Sanz, Marta/J-6186-2012; Tavernarakis, Nektarios/B-9684-2013","Artal-Sanz, Marta/0000-0003-1126-0492; Tavernarakis, Nektarios/0000-0002-5253-1466",EMBO; European Research Council ( ERC); Marie Curie Fellowships; European Commission [LSHM-CT-2005-19063],"We thank A.

Most (70-80%) HCV infections persist and about 30% of individuals with persistent infection develop chronic liver disease, including cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma(2). Epidemiological, viral and host factors have been associated with the differences in HCV clearance or persistence, and studies have demonstrated that a strong host immune response against HCV favours viral clearance(3,4). Thus, variation in genes involved in the immune response may contribute to the ability to clear the virus. In a recent genome-wide association study, a single nucleotide polymorphism (rs12979860) 3 kilobases upstream of the IL28B gene, which encodes the type III interferon IFN-lambda 3, was shown to associate strongly with more than a twofold difference in response to HCV drug treatment(5). To determine the potential effect of rs12979860 variation on outcome to HCV infection in a natural history setting, we genotyped this variant in HCV cohorts comprised of individuals who spontaneously cleared the virus (n = 388) or had persistent infection (n = 620). We show that the C/C genotype strongly enhances resolution of HCV infection among individuals of both European and African ancestry. To our knowledge, this is the strongest and most significant genetic effect associated with natural clearance of HCV, and these results implicate a primary role for IL28B in resolution of HCV infection.","[Martin, Maureen P.; Qi, Ying; O'hUigin, Colm; Carrington, Mary] NCI Frederick, SAIC Frederick Inc, Expt Immunol Lab, Canc & Inflammat Program, Frederick, MD 21702 USA; [Thomas, David L.; Thio, Chloe L.] Johns Hopkins Univ, Div Infect Dis, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA; [Martin, Maureen P.; Qi, Ying; O'hUigin, Colm; Carrington, Mary] MIT, Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Ragon Inst, Boston, MA 02114 USA; [Martin, Maureen P.; Qi, Ying; O'hUigin, Colm; Carrington, Mary] Harvard Univ, Boston, MA 02114 USA; [Ge, Dongliang; Goldstein, David B.] Duke Univ, Inst Genome Sci & Policy, Ctr Human Genome Variat, Durham, NC 27708 USA; [Kidd, Judith; Kidd, Kenneth] Yale Univ, Sch Med, Dept Genet, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Alexander, Graeme] Univ Cambridge, Dept Med, Cambridge CB2 2QQ, England; [Khakoo, Salim I.] Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Div Med, London W2 1NY, England; [Goedert, James J.] NCI, Infect & Immunoepidemiol Branch, Div Canc Epidemiol & Genet, Rockville, MD 20852 USA; [Kirk, Gregory D.] Johns Hopkins Univ, Bloomberg Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Epidemiol, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA; [Donfield, Sharyne M.] Rho Inc, Chapel Hill, NC 27517 USA; [Rosen, Hugo R.] Univ Colorado, Hlth Sci Ctr, Div Gastroenterol & Hepatol, Aurora, CO 80045 USA; [Tobler, Leslie H.] Blood Syst Res Inst, San Francisco, CA 94118 USA; [Busch, Michael P.] Duke Univ, Duke Clin Res Inst, Durham, NC 27705 USA; [McHutchison, John G.] Duke Univ, Sch Med, Div Gastroenterol, Durham, NC 27705 USA","Carrington, M (reprint author), NCI Frederick, SAIC Frederick Inc, Expt Immunol Lab, Canc & Inflammat Program, Frederick, MD 21702 USA.",carringm@mail.nih.gov,"Ge, Dongliang/A-2073-2010","Khakoo, Salim/0000-0002-4057-9091","National Cancer Institute; National Institutes of Health [HHSN261200800001E, R01DA013324, R01DA004334, R01HL076902, R01DK60590, R01HD41224]; Wellcome Trust Senior Clinical Fellow","This project has been funded in whole or in part with federal funds from the National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, under Contract number HHSN261200800001E.

Genome-wide association studies using half a million or more markers, particularly those with very large sample sizes achieved through meta-analysis, have shown great success in mapping genes for other complex genetic traits. Consequently, we initiated a linkage and association mapping study using half a million genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in a common set of 1,031 multiplex autism families ( 1,553 affected offspring). We identified regions of suggestive and significant linkage on chromosomes 6q27 and 20p13, respectively. Initial analysis did not yield genome-wide significant associations; however, genotyping of top hits in additional families revealed an SNP on chromosome 5p15 ( between SEMA5A and TAS2R1) that was significantly associated with autism (P = 2 x 10(-7)). We also demonstrated that expression of SEMA5A is reduced in brains from autistic patients, further implicating SEMA5A as an autism susceptibility gene. The linkage regions reported here provide targets for rare variation screening whereas the discovery of a single novel association demonstrates the action of common variants.","[Weiss, Lauren A.] Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Ctr Human Genet Res, Boston, MA 02114 USA; [Weiss, Lauren A.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Boston, MA 02114 USA; [Weiss, Lauren A.] Broad Inst MIT & Harvard, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; [Arking, Dan E.] Johns Hopkins Univ, Ctr Complex Dis Genom, McKusick Nathans Inst Genet Med, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA","Weiss, LA (reprint author), Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Psychiat, Inst Human Genet, Ctr Neurobiol & Psychiat, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA.",,"; Betancur, Catalina/K-3791-2017; Paterson, Andrew/A-4088-2011; Monaco, Anthony/A-4495-2010; Pinto, Dalila/C-4218-2016; Altshuler, David/A-4476-2009; Haines, Jonathan/C-3374-2012; Howe, Jennifer/I-9013-2012; Scherer, Stephen /B-3785-2013; Pickles, Andrew/A-9625-2011; MOTTRON, Laurent/H-2020-2013; Sutcliffe, James/C-1348-2012; Bolton, Patrick/E-8501-2010; Bailey, Anthony/J-2860-2014; Tansey, Katherine/B-1033-2013","Vicente, Astrid/0000-0001-7134-8037; West, Andrew/0000-0002-3034-4061; Green, Jonathan/0000-0002-0143-181X; Gill, Michael/0000-0003-0206-5337; Buxbaum, Joseph/0000-0001-8898-8313; Nurnberger, John/0000-0002-7674-1767; Green, Andrew/0000-0002-1077-7417; Gallagher, Louise/0000-0001-9462-2836; Betancur, Catalina/0000-0002-3327-4804; R Magalhaes, Tiago/0000-0002-5528-2119; McNeil, Kirsty/0000-0003-0437-3608; Correia, Catarina/0000-0001-5481-2010; Wijsman, Ellen/0000-0002-2725-6669; Oliveira, Guiomar Goncalves/0000-0003-4031-3880; Anney, Richard/0000-0002-6083-407X; Fombonne, Eric/0000-0002-8605-3538; Oliveira, Guiomar/0000-0002-7049-1277; Paterson, Andrew/0000-0002-9169-118X; Monaco, Anthony/0000-0001-7480-3197; Pinto, Dalila/0000-0002-8769-0846; Altshuler, David/0000-0002-7250-4107; Scherer, Stephen /0000-0002-8326-1999; Pickles, Andrew/0000-0003-1283-0346; Sutcliffe, James/0000-0001-5200-6007; Bolton, Patrick/0000-0002-5270-6262; Bailey, Anthony/0000-0003-4257-972X; Tansey, Katherine/0000-0002-9663-3376","National Center for Research Resources [U54 RR020278]; National Institutes of Mental Health [MH60007, MH081754]; Simons Foundation; Autism Consortium of Boston; NIMH [1R01 MH083565, 1K23MH080954]; Nancy Lurie Marks ( NLM) Family Foundation; National Institute of Health [MH52708, MH39437, MH00219, MH00980, MH6454, MH61009, MH55135, MH55284, HD055782, NS042165]; National Health Medical Research Council [0034328]; Scottish Rite; Spunk Fund, Inc.; Rebecca and Solomon Baker Fund; APEX Foundation; National Alliance for Research in Schizophrenia and Affective Disorders ( NARSAD),; Nancy Pritzker Laboratory; Cure Autism Now Foundation; Fundacao Calouste Gulbenkian; INSERM, Fondation de France, Fondation Orange; Fondation pour la Recherche Medicale; Swedish Science Council; The Seaver Foundation; The Children's Medical & Research Foundation; Our Lady's Children's Hospital, Crumlin, Ireland; The Medical Research Council ( MRC)","The Autism Genome Project ( AGP) work was supported by the following grants: ( 1) The Hilibrand Foundation ( Principal Investigaor Joachim F.

Here we used these approaches to sequence the genomes (>43-fold coverage) and transcriptomes of an oestrogen-receptor-apositive metastatic lobular breast cancer at depth. We found 32 somatic non-synonymous coding mutations present in the metastasis, and measured the frequency of these somatic mutations in DNA from the primary tumour of the same patient, which arose 9 years earlier. Five of the 32 mutations (in ABCB11, HAUS3, SLC24A4, SNX4 and PALB2) were prevalent in the DNA of the primary tumour removed at diagnosis 9 years earlier, six ( in KIF1C, USP28, MYH8, MORC1, KIAA1468 and RNASEH2A) were present at lower frequencies (1-13%), 19 were not detected in the primary tumour, and two were undetermined. The combined analysis of genome and transcriptome data revealed two new RNA-editing events that recode the amino acid sequence of SRP9 and COG3. Taken together, our data show that single nucleotide mutational heterogeneity can be a property of low or intermediate grade primary breast cancers and that significant evolution can occur with disease progression.","[Morin, Ryan D.; Pugh, Trevor; Delaney, Allen; Holt, Robert A.; Jones, Steven; Moore, Richard; Severson, Tesa; Taylor, Greg A.; Varhol, Richard; Warren, Rene L.; Zhao, Yongjun; Hirst, Martin; Marra, Marco A.] British Columbia Canc Agcy, Michael Smith Genome Sci Ctr, Vancouver, BC V5Z 1L3, Canada; [Shah, Sohrab P.; Senz, Janine; Steidl, Christian; Huntsman, David; Aparicio, Samuel] British Columbia Canc Agcy, Ctr Translat & Appl Genom, Vancouver, BC V5Z 1L3, Canada; [Steidl, Christian; Huntsman, David; Aparicio, Samuel] Univ British Columbia, Dept Pathol, Vancouver, BC V6T 2B5, Canada; [Teschendorff, Andrew E.; Caldas, Carlos] Li Ka Shing Ctr, Cambridge Res Inst, Canc Res UK, Cambridge CB2 0RE, England; [Watson, Peter] BC Canc Agcy, Deeley Res Ctr, Victoria, BC V8R 6V5, Canada","Marra, MA (reprint author), British Columbia Canc Agcy, Michael Smith Genome Sci Ctr, 675 W 10th Ave, Vancouver, BC V5Z 1L3, Canada.",mmarra@bcgsc.ca; saparicio@bccrc.ca,"Caldas, Carlos/A-7543-2008; Turashvili, Gulisa/A-6056-2008; Tang, Macy/B-9798-2014; Holt, Robert/C-3303-2009; Marra, Marco/B-5987-2008; Hirst, Martin/B-7684-2016; Jones, Steven/C-3621-2009","Warren, Rene/0000-0002-9890-2293; Morin, Ryan/0000-0003-2932-7800",Michael Smith Foundation for Health Research; Vanier scholar (CIHR); NSERC; Canada Foundation for Innovation; BC Cancer Foundation,"We thank C.

The recent application of microarray and sequencing technologies to transcriptomics has changed the simplistic view of transcriptomes to a more complicated view of genome-wide transcription where a large fraction of transcripts emanates from unannotated parts of genomes(1-7), and underlined our limited knowledge of the dynamic state of transcription. Most of this broad body of knowledge was obtained indirectly because current transcriptome analysis methods typically require RNA to be converted to complementary DNA ( cDNA) before measurements, even though the cDNA synthesis step introduces multiple biases and artefacts that interfere with both the proper characterization and quantification of transcripts(8-18). Furthermore, cDNA synthesis is not particularly suitable for the analysis of short, degraded and/or small quantity RNA samples. Here we report direct single molecule RNA sequencing without prior conversion of RNA to cDNA. We applied this technology to sequence femtomole quantities of poly(A)(+) Saccharomyces cerevisiae RNA using a surface coated with poly(dT) oligonucleotides to capture the RNAs at their natural poly(A) tails and initiate sequencing by synthesis. We observed transcript 3' end heterogeneity and polyadenylated small nucleolar RNAs.

JAK2 is a non-receptor tyrosine kinase that regulates several cellular processes by inducing cytoplasmic signalling cascades. Here we show that human JAK2 is present in the nucleus of haematopoietic cells and directly phosphorylates Tyr 41 (Y41) on histone H3. Heterochromatin protein 1 alpha (HP1 alpha), but not HP1 beta, specifically binds to this region of H3 through its chromo-shadow domain. Phosphorylation of H3Y41 by JAK2 prevents this binding. Inhibition of JAK2 activity in human leukaemic cells decreases both the expression of the haematopoietic oncogene lmo2 and the phosphorylation of H3Y41 at its promoter, while simultaneously increasing the binding of HP1a at the same site. These results identify a previously unrecognized nuclear role for JAK2 in the phosphorylation of H3Y41 and reveal a direct mechanistic link between two genes, jak2 and lmo2, involved in normal haematopoiesis and leukaemia(1-9).","[Dawson, Mark A.; Goettgens, Berthold; Foster, Samuel D.; Green, Anthony R.] Univ Cambridge, Cambridge Inst Med Res, Cambridge CB2 0XY, England; [Dawson, Mark A.; Goettgens, Berthold; Foster, Samuel D.; Green, Anthony R.] Univ Cambridge, Dept Haematol, Cambridge CB2 0XY, England; [Dawson, Mark A.; Green, Anthony R.] Addenbrookes Hosp, Dept Haematol, Cambridge CB2 0QQ, England; [Bannister, Andrew J.; Bartke, Till; Kouzarides, Tony] Univ Cambridge, Gurdon Inst, Cambridge CB2 1QN, England; [Bannister, Andrew J.; Bartke, Till; Kouzarides, Tony] Univ Cambridge, Dept Pathol, Cambridge CB2 1QN, England","Green, AR (reprint author), Univ Cambridge, Cambridge Inst Med Res, Hills Rd, Cambridge CB2 0XY, England.",arg1000@cam.ac.uk; t.kouzarides@gurdon.cam.ac.uk,"Dawson, Mark/B-9317-2017","Dawson, Mark/0000-0002-5464-5029; Bannister, Andrew/0000-0002-6312-4436","General Sir John Monash Foundation; Cambridge Commonwealth Trust; Raymond and Beverly Sackler; UK Leukaemia Research Fund; Wellcome Trust; Leukemia & Lymphoma Society of America; National Institute for Health Research Cambridge Biomedical Research Centre; Leukaemia Research Fund; Cancer Research UK; Medical Research Council; 6th Research Framework Programme of the European Union ( Epitron, HEROIC and SMARTER).","We thank P.

Small silencing RNAs of similar to 20-30 nucleotides and their associated effector proteins, the Argonaute family proteins, are the central components in RNA silencing(2). A subset of small RNAs, such as microRNAs and small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) in plants, Piwi-interacting RNAs in animals and siRNAs in Drosophila, requires an additional crucial step for their maturation; that is, 2'-O-methylation on the 39 terminal nucleotide(3-6). A conserved S-adenosyl-L-methionine-dependent RNA methyltransferase, HUA ENHANCER 1 (HEN1), and its homologues are responsible for this specific modification(3-5,7,8). Here we report the 3.1 angstrom crystal structure of full-length HEN1 from Arabidopsis in complex with a 22-nucleotide small RNA duplex and cofactor product S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine. Highly cooperative recognition of the small RNA substrate by multiple RNA binding domains and the methyltransferase domain in HEN1 measures the length of the RNA duplex and determines the substrate specificity. Metal ion coordination by both 2' and 3' hydroxyls on the 3'-terminal nucleotide and four invariant residues in the active site of the methyltransferase domain suggests a novel Mg(2+)-dependent 2'-O-methylation mechanism.","[Huang, Ying; Huang, Qichen; Vassylyev, Dmitry G.; Ma, Jin-Biao] Univ Alabama, Dept Biochem, Birmingham, AL 35294 USA; [Huang, Ying; Huang, Qichen; Vassylyev, Dmitry G.; Ma, Jin-Biao] Univ Alabama, Sch Med, Dept Mol Genet, Birmingham, AL 35294 USA; [Huang, Ying; Huang, Qichen; Vassylyev, Dmitry G.; Ma, Jin-Biao] Univ Alabama, Sch Dent, Birmingham, AL 35294 USA; [Ji, Lijuan; Chen, Xuemei] Univ Calif Riverside, Dept Bot & Plant Sci, Inst Integrat Genome Biol, Riverside, CA 92521 USA; [Ma, Jin-Biao] Univ Alabama, Ctr Comprehens Canc, Birmingham, AL 35294 USA","Ma, JB (reprint author), Univ Alabama, Dept Biochem, Birmingham, AL 35294 USA.",jma@biochemistry.uab.edu,"Vassylyev, Dmitry/A-9005-2008; Ji, Lijuan/C-4919-2012","Ji, Lijuan/0000-0003-0678-6131; Chen, Xuemei/0000-0002-5209-1157","V Foundation for Cancer Research; National Science Foundation [MCB-0718029]; National Institutes of Health [R01 GM074252, R01 GM074840]","We thank K.

Deregulated Wnt pathway activity has been implicated in many cancers, making this pathway an attractive target for anticancer therapies. However, the development of targeted Wnt pathway inhibitors has been hampered by the limited number of pathway components that are amenable to small molecule inhibition. Here, we used a chemical genetic screen to identify a small molecule, XAV939, which selectively inhibits beta-catenin-mediated transcription. XAV939 stimulates beta-catenin degradation by stabilizing axin, the concentration-limiting component of the destruction complex. Using a quantitative chemical proteomic approach, we discovered that XAV939 stabilizes axin by inhibiting the poly-ADP-ribosylating enzymes tankyrase 1 and tankyrase 2. Both tankyrase isoforms interact with a highly conserved domain of axin and stimulate its degradation through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Thus, our study provides new mechanistic insights into the regulation of axin protein homeostasis and presents new avenues for targeted Wnt pathway therapies.","[Huang, Shih-Min A.; Mishina, Yuji M.; Liu, Shanming; Cheung, Atwood; Stegmeier, Frank; Michaud, Gregory A.; Charlat, Olga; Wiellette, Elizabeth; Zhang, Yue; Wiessner, Stephanie; Hild, Marc; Shi, Xiaoying; Wilson, Christopher J.; Mickanin, Craig; Myer, Vic; Fazal, Aleem; Tomlinson, Ronald; Serluca, Fabrizio; Shao, Wenlin; Cheng, Hong; Shultz, Michael; Fawell, Stephen; Lu, Chris; Curtis, Daniel; Lengauer, Christoph; Finan, Peter M.; Tallarico, John A.; Porter, Jeffery A.; Cong, Feng] Novartis Inst Biomed Res, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Rau, Christina; Schirle, Markus; Schlegl, Judith; Ghidelli, Sonja; Bouwmeester, Tewis; Bauer, Andreas] Cellzome AG, D-69117 Heidelberg, Germany; [Kirschner, Marc W.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Syst Biol, Boston, MA 02115 USA","Cong, F (reprint author), Novartis Inst Biomed Res, 250 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",feng.cong@novartis.com,,,,,,29,860,879,4,101,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,1-Oct,2009,461,7264,,,,,614,620,,10.1038/nature08356,,7,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,500LH,WOS:000270302600032,19759537,No,Y,N,11/20/17

Most anti-infectives kill replicating pathogens, but few preferentially kill pathogens that have been forced into a non-replicating state by conditions in the host. To explore these alternative approaches we sought selective inhibitors of the proteasome of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Given that the proteasome structure is extensively conserved, it is not surprising that inhibitors of all chemical classes tested have blocked both eukaryotic and prokaryotic proteasomes, and no inhibitor has proved substantially more potent on proteasomes of pathogens than of their hosts. Here we show that certain oxathiazol-2-one compounds kill non-replicating M. tuberculosis and act as selective suicide-substrate inhibitors of the M. tuberculosis proteasome by cyclocarbonylating its active site threonine. Major conformational changes protect the inhibitor-enzyme intermediate from hydrolysis, allowing formation of an oxazolidin-2-one and preventing regeneration of active protease. Residues outside the active site whose hydrogen bonds stabilize the critical loop before and after it moves are extensively non-conserved. This may account for the ability of oxathiazol-2-one compounds to inhibit the mycobacterial proteasome potently and irreversibly while largely sparing the human homologue.","[Lin, Gang; de Carvalho, Luiz Pedro Sorio; Vogt, Guillaume; Wu, Kangyun; Schneider, Jean; Chidawanyika, Tamutenda; Nathan, Carl] Weill Cornell Med Coll, Dept Microbiol & Immunol, New York, NY 10065 USA; [Tao, Hui; Warren, J.

This scaling relation holds for galaxies spanning a luminosity range of 14 magnitudes and the whole Hubble sequence(1-3). Here we report that the luminous matter surface density is also constant within one scale-length of the dark halo. This means that the gravitational acceleration generated by the luminous component in galaxies is always the same at this radius. Although the total luminous-to-dark matter ratio is not constant, within one halo scale-length it is constant.

Examples of recent advances are microscopic lasers that can reach the diffraction limit, based on photonic crystals(3), metal-clad cavities(4) and nanowires(5-7). However, such lasers are restricted, both in optical mode size and physical device dimension, to being larger than half the wavelength of the optical field, and it remains a key fundamental challenge to realize ultracompact lasers that can directly generate coherent optical fields at the nanometre scale, far beyond the diffraction limit(10,11). A way of addressing this issue is to make use of surface plasmons(12,13), which are capable of tightly localizing light, but so far ohmic losses at optical frequencies have inhibited the realization of truly nanometre-scale lasers based on such approaches(14,15). A recent theoretical work predicted that such losses could be significantly reduced while maintaining ultrasmall modes in a hybrid plasmonic waveguide(16). Here we report the experimental demonstration of nanometre-scale plasmonic lasers, generating optical modes a hundred times smaller than the diffraction limit. We realize such lasers using a hybrid plasmonic waveguide consisting of a high-gain cadmium sulphide semiconductor nanowire, separated from a silver surface by a 5-nm thick insulating gap. Direct measurements of the emission lifetime reveal a broad-band enhancement of the nanowire's exciton spontaneous emission rate by up to six times owing to the strong mode confinement(17) and the signature of apparently threshold-less lasing. Because plasmonic modes have no cutoff, we are able to demonstrate downscaling of the lateral dimensions of both the device and the optical mode. Plasmonic lasers thus offer the possibility of exploring extreme interactions between light and matter, opening up new avenues in the fields of active photonic circuits(18), bio-sensing(19) and quantum information technology(20).","[Oulton, Rupert F.; Sorger, Volker J.; Zentgraf, Thomas; Gladden, Christopher; Bartal, Guy; Zhang, Xiang] Univ Calif Berkeley, NSF Nanoscale Sci & Engn Ctr, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Zhang, Xiang] Univ Calif Berkeley, Lawrence Berkeley Lab, Div Mat Sci, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Ma, Ren-Min; Dai, Lun] Peking Univ, Sch Phys, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China; [Ma, Ren-Min; Dai, Lun] Peking Univ, State Key Lab Mesoscop Phys, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China","Zhang, X (reprint author), Univ Calif Berkeley, NSF Nanoscale Sci & Engn Ctr, 3112 Etcheverry Hall, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",xiang@berkeley.edu,"Ma, Ren-Min/H-9621-2012; Zentgraf, Thomas/G-8848-2013","Zentgraf, Thomas/0000-0002-8662-1101","US Air Force Office of Scientific Research (AFOSR) MURI programme [FA9550-04-1-0434]; National Science Foundation Nano-scale Science and Engineering Center (NSF-NSEC) [CMMI-0751621]; Alexander von Humboldt Foundation; Intel Corporation; National Natural Science Foundation of China [60576037, 10774007]; National Basic Research Program of China [2006CB921607, 2007CB613402]",We thank M.

Extending its use to the in situ mapping of chemical transformations could provide valuable insights, as illustrated by time-resolved X-ray crystallography studies(2,3); however, the transient nature of unstable reaction intermediates often poses a significant challenge. It has recently been demonstrated that standard chemical reactions can occur within the pores of porous coordination networks(4-6) and that the robust crystallinity of these networks facilitates in situ X-ray analysis of the adducts and products(7-11). Here we show that such systems even enable X-ray observations of reaction intermediates that are usually transient and non-isolable. Our proof-of-concept demonstration examines the simple and ubiquitous reaction between an amine and an aldehyde, which normally form a very short-lived hemiaminal that then yields the Schiff-base product. The mechanism of this reaction has been exhaustively examined, but the hemiaminal intermediate has only rarely been observed(12-16). We first determine the structure of a porous network with an aromatic amine embedded in it, then diffuse an aldehyde substrate into the material to transform the amine into a hemiaminal intermediate that is kinetically trapped and thus amenable to X-ray analysis, and finally raise the temperature of the system to obtain the imine product and determine its structure. These results establish that porous network materials provide a means of obtaining sequential X-ray-based snapshots of the structural transformations that occur during chemical reactions.","[Kawamichi, Takehide; Haneda, Tsuyoshi; Kawano, Masaki; Fujita, Makoto] Univ Tokyo, Sch Engn, Dept Appl Chem, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo 1138656, Japan; [Fujita, Makoto] Japan Sci & Technol Agcy, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo 1138656, Japan","Kawano, M (reprint author), Univ Tokyo, Sch Engn, Dept Appl Chem, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo 1138656, Japan.",mkawano@postech.ac.kr; mfujita@appchem.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp,"Fujita, Makoto/E-6350-2012",,"Japan Science and Technology Agency; KAKENHI; Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, the Global COE Program (Chemistry Innovation through Cooperation of Science and Engineering), MEXT, Japan; Koei Chemical Co.

Although changes in fault strength have been suggested to explain various phenomena, such as the remote triggering of seismicity(1), there has been no means of actually monitoring this important property in situ. Here we argue that similar to 20 years of observation (1987-2008) of the Parkfield area at the San Andreas fault have revealed a means of monitoring fault strength. We have identified two occasions where long-term changes in fault strength have been most probably induced remotely by large seismic events, namely the 2004 magnitude (M) 9.1 Sumatra-Andaman earthquake and the earlier 1992 M = 7.3 Landers earthquake. In both cases, the change possessed two manifestations: temporal variations in the properties of seismic scatterers-probably reflecting the stress-induced migration of fluids-and systematic temporal variations in the characteristics of repeating-earthquake sequences that are most consistent with changes in fault strength. In the case of the 1992 Landers earthquake, a period of reduced strength probably triggered the 1993 Parkfield aseismic transient(2-5) as well as the accompanying cluster of four M>4 earthquakes at Parkfield. The fault-strength changes produced by the distant 2004 Sumatra-Andaman earthquake are especially important, as they suggest that the very largest earthquakes may have a global influence on the strength of the Earth's fault systems. As such a perturbation would bring many fault zones closer to failure, it should lead to temporal clustering of global seismicity. This hypothesis seems to be supported by the unusually high number of M >= 8 earthquakes occurring in the few years following the 2004 Sumatra-Andaman earthquake.","[Taira, Taka'aki; Silver, Paul G.] Carnegie Inst Washington, Dept Terr Magnetism, Washington, DC 20015 USA; [Niu, Fenglin] Rice Univ, Dept Earth Sci, Houston, TX 77005 USA; [Nadeau, Robert M.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley Seismol Lab, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA","Taira, T (reprint author), Carnegie Inst Washington, Dept Terr Magnetism, 5241 Broad Branch Rd NW, Washington, DC 20015 USA.",taira@dtm.ciw.edu,"Niu, Fenglin/A-2548-2011; Taira, Taka'aki/L-5839-2013; Nadeau, Robert/G-1884-2017","Taira, Taka'aki/0000-0002-6170-797X; Nadeau, Robert/0000-0003-1255-0643","National Science Foundation [EAR-0337308, EAR-0408947, EAR-0409024, EAR-0453638, EAR-0537641, EAR-0544730, DTM-2025-01]; Department of Terrestrial Magnetism; Carnegie Institution of Washington; US Geological Survey (USGS) through National Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program [07HQAG0014]","This work was supported by the National Science Foundation EAR-0337308, EAR-0408947, EAR-0409024, EAR-0453638, EAR-0537641, EAR-0544730 and DTM-2025-01, and by the Department of Terrestrial Magnetism, Carnegie Institution of Washington.

In Drosophila, Dscam1 generates 19,008 different ectodomains by alternative splicing of three exon clusters, each encoding half or a complete variable immunoglobulin domain(3). Identical isoforms bind to each other, but rarely to isoforms differing at any one of the variable immunoglobulin domains(4,5). Binding between isoforms on opposing membranes promotes repulsion(6). Isoform diversity provides the molecular basis for neurite self-avoidance(6-11). Self-avoidance refers to the tendency of branches from the same neuron (self-branches) to selectively avoid one another(12). To ensure that repulsion is restricted to self-branches, different neurons express different sets of isoforms in a biased stochastic fashion(7,13). Genetic studies demonstrated that Dscam1 diversity has a profound role in wiring the fly brain(11). Here we show how many isoforms are required to provide an identification system that prevents non-self branches from inappropriately recognizing each other. Using homologous recombination, we generated mutant animals encoding 12, 24, 576 and 1,152 potential isoforms. Mutant animals with deletions encoding 4,752 and 14,256 isoforms(14) were also analysed. Branching phenotypes were assessed in three classes of neurons. Branching patterns improved as the potential number of isoforms increased, and this was independent of the identity of the isoforms. Although branching defects in animals with 1,152 potential isoforms remained substantial, animals with 4,752 isoforms were indistinguishable from wild-type controls. Mathematical modelling studies were consistent with the experimental results that thousands of isoforms are necessary to ensure acquisition of unique Dscam1 identities in many neurons. We conclude that thousands of isoforms are essential to provide neurons with a robust discrimination mechanism to distinguish between self and non-self during self-avoidance.","[Hattori, Daisuke; Chen, Yi; Zipursky, S.

It is believed that Atg5 (ref. 4) and Atg7 (ref. 5) are essential genes for mammalian macroautophagy. Here we show, however, that mouse cells lacking Atg5 or Atg7 can still form autophagosomes/autolysosomes and perform autophagy-mediated protein degradation when subjected to certain stressors. Although lipidation of the microtubule-associated protein light chain 3 (LC3, also known as Map1lc3a) to form LC3-II is generally considered to be a good indicator of macroautophagy(6), it did not occur during the Atg5/Atg7-independent alternative process of macroautophagy. We also found that this alternative process of macroautophagy was regulated by several autophagic proteins, including Unc-51-like kinase 1 (Ulk1) and beclin 1. Unlike conventional macroautophagy, autophagosomes seemed to be generated in aRab9-dependent manner by the fusion of isolation membranes with vesicles derived from the trans-Golgi and late endosomes. In vivo, Atg5-independent alternative macroautophagy was detected in several embryonic tissues. It also had a function in clearing mitochondria during erythroid maturation. These results indicate that mammalian macroautophagy can occur through at least two different pathways: an Atg5/Atg7-dependent conventional pathway and an Atg5/Atg7-independent alternative pathway.","[Nishida, Yuya; Arakawa, Satoko; Fujitani, Kenji; Yamaguchi, Hirofumi; Mizuta, Takeshi; Kanaseki, Toku; Shimizu, Shigeomi] Tokyo Med & Dent Univ, Med Res Inst, Dept Pathol Cell Biol, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo 1138510, Japan; [Otsu, Kinya] Osaka Univ, Sch Med, Dept Cardiovasc Med, Suita, Osaka 5650871, Japan; [Nishida, Yuya; Tsujimoto, Yoshihide] Osaka Univ, Sch Med, Dept Med Genet, Suita, Osaka 5650871, Japan; [Komatsu, Masaaki] Tokyo Metropolitan Inst Med Sci, Lab Frontier Sci, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo 1138613, Japan","Shimizu, S (reprint author), Tokyo Med & Dent Univ, Med Res Inst, Dept Pathol Cell Biol, Bunkyo Ku, 1-5-45 Yushima, Tokyo 1138510, Japan.",shimizu.pcb@mri.tmd.ac.jp,,,"Program for Promotion of Fundamental Studies in Health Sciences of the National Institute of Biomedical Innovation (NIBIO); Creative Scientific Research; Japanese Ministry of Education, Science, Sports and Culture; Japanese Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare; Japan Science and Technology Corporation; Uehara Memorial Foundation; Sagawa Foundation for Promotion of Cancer Research; YASUDA Medical Foundation; Astellas foundation for research on metabolic disorders; Foundation for Promotion of Cancer Research","We thank M.

Accordingly, mutations in their genes cause severe lymphadenopathy and autoimmune disease in mice(6,7) and humans(8,9). FasL function is regulated by deposition in the plasma membrane and metalloprotease-mediated shedding(10,11). Here we generated gene-targeted mice that selectively lack either secreted FasL (sFasL) or membrane-bound FasL (mFasL) to resolve which of these forms is required for cell killing and to explore their hypothesized non-apoptotic activities. Mice lacking sFasL (FasL(Delta s/Delta s)) appeared normal and their T cells readily killed target cells, whereas T cells lacking mFasL (FasL(Delta m/Delta m)) could not kill cells through Fas activation. FasL(Delta m/Delta m) mice developed lymphadenopathy and hypergammaglobulinaemia, similar to FasL(gld/gld) mice, which express a mutant form of FasL that cannot bind Fas, but surprisingly, FasL(Delta m/Delta m) mice (on a C57BL/6 background) succumbed to systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)-like autoimmune kidney destruction and histiocytic sarcoma, diseases that occur only rarely and much later in FasL(gld/gld) mice. These results demonstrate that mFasL is essential for cytotoxic activity and constitutes the guardian against lymphadenopathy, autoimmunity and cancer, whereas excess sFasL appears to promote autoimmunity and tumorigenesis through nonapoptotic activities.","[Reilly, Lorraine A.

Whereas effector-mediated recognition of single post-translational modifications is well characterized(3), how the cell achieves combinatorial readout of histones bearing multiple modifications is poorly understood. One mechanism involves multivalent binding by linked effector modules(4). For example, the tandem bromodomains of human TATA-binding protein-associated factor-1 (TAF1) bind better to a diacetylated histone H4 tail than to monoacetylated tails, a cooperative effect attributed to each bromodomain engaging one acetyl-lysine mark(5). Here we report a distinct mechanism of combinatorial readout for the mouse TAF1 homologue Brdt, a testis-specific member of the BET protein family(6). Brdt associates with hyperacetylated histone H4 (ref. 7) and is implicated in the marked chromatin remodelling that follows histone hyperacetylation during spermiogenesis, the stage of spermatogenesis in which post-meiotic germ cells mature into fully differentiated sperm(7-10). Notably, we find that a single bromodomain (BD1) of Brdt is responsible for selectively recognizing histone H4 tails bearing two or more acetylation marks. The crystal structure of BD1 bound to a diacetylated H4 tail shows how two acetyl-lysine residues cooperate to interact with one binding pocket. Structure-based mutagenesis that reduces the selectivity of BD1 towards diacetylated tails destabilizes the association of Brdt with acetylated chromatin in vivo. Structural analysis suggests that other chromatin-associated proteins may be capable of a similar mode of ligand recognition, including yeast Bdf1, human TAF1 and human CBP/p300 (also known as CREBBP and EP300, respectively). Our findings describe a new mechanism for the combinatorial readout of histone modifications in which a single effector module engages two marks on a histone tail as a composite binding epitope.","[Steuerwald, Ulrich; Krijgsveld, Jeroen; Mueller, Christoph W.] European Mol Biol Lab, D-69117 Heidelberg, Germany; [Moriniere, Jeanne; Soler-Lopez, Montserrat; Hart, Darren J.] European Mol Biol Lab, Grenoble Outstn, F-38042 Grenoble 9, France; [Moriniere, Jeanne; Soler-Lopez, Montserrat; Hart, Darren J.] Univ Grenoble 1, CNRS, EMBL, Unit Virus Host Cell Interact,UMI 3265, F-38042 Grenoble 9, France; [Rousseaux, Sophie; Curtet, Sandrine; Vitte, Anne-Laure; Govin, Jerome; Gaucher, Jonathan; Sadoul, Karin; Khochbin, Saadi] Univ Grenoble 1, INSERM, U823, Inst Albert Bonniot, F-38700 Grenoble, France; [Petosa, Carlo] Univ Grenoble 1, CNRS, CEA, Inst Biol Struct Jean Pierre Ebel,UMR 5075, F-38027 Grenoble 1, France","Muller, CW (reprint author), European Mol Biol Lab, Meyerhofstr 1, D-69117 Heidelberg, Germany.",christoph.mueller@embl.de,"Krijgsveld, Jeroen/F-5974-2011; Khochbin, Saadi/M-8090-2013; Sadoul, Karin/N-2649-2013; Govin, Jerome/B-2326-2014; CURTET, Sandrine/N-3517-2013; Rousseaux, Sophie/G-1697-2013","Govin, Jerome/0000-0001-5511-6965; Hart, Darren/0000-0002-3502-2002; Mueller, Christoph/0000-0003-2176-8337; Krijgsveld, Jeroen/0000-0001-7549-9326",Rhone-Alpes region; EU; ANRS/Fondation de France AIJC; CNRS ATIP programmes,"We thank the ESRF and EMBL staff for beamline assistance, the Partnership for Structural Biology (PSB) for access to technical platforms, M.

A subset of these enzymes consists of multimeric ringed pumps responsible for DNA transport in processes including genome packaging in adenoviruses, herpesviruses, poxviruses and tailed bacteriophages(2). Although their mechanism of mechanochemical conversion is beginning to be understood(3), little is known about how these motors engage their nucleic acid substrates. Questions remain as to whether the motors contact a single DNA element, such as a phosphate or a base, or whether contacts are distributed over several parts of the DNA. Furthermore, the role of these contacts in the mechanochemical cycle is unknown. Here we use the genome packaging motor of the Bacillus subtilis bacteriophage phi 29 (ref. 4) to address these questions. The full mechanochemical cycle of the motor, in which the ATPase is a pentameric-ring(5) of gene product 16 (gp16), involves two phases-an ATP-loading dwell followed by a translocation burst of four 2.5-base-pair (bp) steps(6) triggered by hydrolysis product release(7). By challenging the motor with a variety of modified DNA substrates, we show that during the dwell phase important contacts are made with adjacent phosphates every 10-bp on the 5'-3' strand in the direction of packaging. As well as providing stable, long-lived contacts, these phosphate interactions also regulate the chemical cycle. In contrast, during the burst phase, we find that DNA translocation is driven against large forces by extensive contacts, some of which are not specific to the chemical moieties of DNA. Such promiscuous, nonspecific contacts may reflect common translocase-substrate interactions for both the nucleic acid and protein translocases of the ASCE superfamily(1).","[Aathavan, K.; Politzer, Adam T.; Bustamante, Carlos] Univ Calif Berkeley, Biophys Grad Grp, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Aathavan, K.; Politzer, Adam T.; Kaplan, Ariel; Moffitt, Jeffrey R.; Chemla, Yann R.; Bustamante, Carlos] Univ Calif Berkeley, Jason L Choy Lab Single Mol Biophys, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Kaplan, Ariel; Bustamante, Carlos] Univ Calif Berkeley, Inst QB3, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Kaplan, Ariel; Moffitt, Jeffrey R.; Chemla, Yann R.; Bustamante, Carlos] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Phys, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Grimes, Shelley; Jardine, Paul J.; Anderson, Dwight L.] Univ Minnesota, Dept Diagnost & Biol Sci, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA; [Grimes, Shelley; Jardine, Paul J.; Anderson, Dwight L.] Univ Minnesota, Inst Mol Virol, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA; [Anderson, Dwight L.] Univ Minnesota, Dept Microbiol, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA; [Bustamante, Carlos] Univ Calif Berkeley, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Bustamante, Carlos] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mol & Cell Biol, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Bustamante, Carlos] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Chem, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA","Bustamante, C (reprint author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Biophys Grad Grp, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",carlos@alice.berkeley.edu,"Kaplan, Ariel/F-3657-2010","Kaplan, Ariel/0000-0002-9731-6962; Jardine, Paul/0000-0002-1090-0550; Bustamante, Carlos/0000-0002-2970-0073; Chemla, Yann/0000-0001-9167-0234","Burroughs Wellcome Fund; NIH Molecular Biophysics Training Grant; Human Frontier Science Program Cross-Disciplinary Fellowship; NSF Graduate Research Fellowship; Burroughs Wellcome Fund Career Award; National Institutes of Health ( NIH) [GM-071552, DE-003606, GM-059604]","We thank C.

Their activity involves the transient cleavage of DNA, which, if it occurs near sites of endogenous DNA damage or in the presence of topoisomerase poisons, can result in abortive topoisomerase-induced DNA strand breaks(3-5). These breaks feature covalent linkage of the enzyme to the DNA termini by a 3'- or 5'-phosphotyrosyl bond and are implicated in hereditary human disease(6-8), chromosomal instability and cancer(4,9), and underlie the clinical efficacy of an important class of anti-tumour poisons(3,9,10). The importance of liberating DNA termini from trapped topoisomerase is illustrated by the progressive neurodegenerative disease observed in individuals containing a mutation in tyrosyl-DNA phosphodiesterase 1 (TDP1), an enzyme that cleaves 3'-phosphotyrosyl bonds(6-8). However, a complementary human enzyme that cleaves 5'-phosphotyrosyl bonds has not been reported, despite the effect of DNA double-strand breaks containing such termini on chromosome instability and cancer(6-8). Here we identify such an enzyme in human cells and show that this activity efficiently restores 5'-phosphate termini at DNA double-strand breaks in preparation for DNA ligation. This enzyme, TTRAP, is a member of the Mg(2+)/Mn(2+)-dependent family of phosphodiesterases. Cellular depletion of TTRAP results in increased susceptibility and sensitivity to topoisomerase-II-induced DNA double-strand breaks. TTRAP is, to our knowledge, the first human 5'-tyrosyl DNA phosphodiesterase to be identified, and we suggest that this enzyme is denoted tyrosyl DNA phosphodiesterase-2 (TDP2).","[Ledesma, Felipe Cortes; El Khamisy, Sherif F.; Zuma, Maria C.; Osborn, Kay; Caldecott, Keith W.] Univ Sussex, Genome Damage & Stabil Ctr, Brighton BN1 9RQ, E Sussex, England; [El Khamisy, Sherif F.] Ain Shams Univ, Fac Pharm, Dept Biochem, Cairo 11566, Egypt","Caldecott, KW (reprint author), Univ Sussex, Genome Damage & Stabil Ctr, Sci Pk Rd, Brighton BN1 9RQ, E Sussex, England.",fc55@sussex.ac.uk; k.w.caldecott@sussex.ac.uk,"Cortes Ledesma, Felipe/F-4803-2014","Cortes Ledesma, Felipe/0000-0002-0440-6783; , Sherif/0000-0003-2721-7763",MRC [G0600776]; BBSRC [BB/C516595/1]; CR-UK [C6563/A10192]; Wellcome Trust [085284]; Marie Curie [2007-2-1-IEF-221222]; EMBO [ALTF 956-2006],"This work was funded by the MRC (G0600776), the BBSRC (BB/C516595/1), and CR-UK (C6563/A10192).

We analyse 25 diverse groups in India to provide strong evidence for two ancient populations, genetically divergent, that are ancestral to most Indians today. One, the 'Ancestral North Indians' ( ANI), is genetically close to Middle Easterners, Central Asians, and Europeans, whereas the other, the 'Ancestral South Indians' (ASI), is as distinct from ANI and East Asians as they are from each other. By introducing methods that can estimate ancestry without accurate ancestral populations, we show that ANI ancestry ranges from 39-71% in most Indian groups, and is higher in traditionally upper caste and Indo-European speakers. Groups with only ASI ancestry may no longer exist in mainland India. However, the indigenous Andaman Islanders are unique in being ASI-related groups without ANI ancestry. Allele frequency differences between groups in India are larger than in Europe, reflecting strong founder effects whose signatures have been maintained for thousands of years owing to endogamy. We therefore predict that there will be an excess of recessive diseases in India, which should be possible to screen and map genetically.","[Reich, David] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Genet, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Reich, David; Patterson, Nick; Price, Alkes L.] Broad Inst Harvard & MIT, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; [Thangaraj, Kumarasamy; Singh, Lalji] Ctr Cellular & Mol Biol, Hyderabad 500007, Andhra Pradesh, India; [Price, Alkes L.] Harvard Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Epidemiol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Price, Alkes L.] Harvard Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Biostat, Boston, MA 02115 USA","Reich, D (reprint author), Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Genet, Boston, MA 02115 USA.",reich@genetics.med.harvard.edu; lalji@ccmb.res.in,"Thangaraj, Kumarasamy/G-5596-2010","Thangaraj, Kumarasamy/0000-0002-0075-0106",NIH [HG004168]; Burroughs Wellcome Career Development Award; Council of Scientific and Industrial Research of the Government of India; UKIERI Major Award [RG-4772],"We thank the volunteers from throughout India who donated DNA; A.

Here we show that a known regulator of prostate epithelial differentiation, the homeobox gene Nkx3-1, marks a stem cell population that functions during prostate regeneration. Genetic lineage-marking demonstrates that rare luminal cells that express Nkx3-1 in the absence of testicular androgens (castration-resistant Nkx3-1-expressing cells, CARNs) are bipotential and can self-renew in vivo, and single-cell transplantation assays show that CARNs can reconstitute prostate ducts in renal grafts. Functional assays of Nkx3-1 mutant mice in serial prostate regeneration suggest that Nkx3-1 is required for stem cell maintenance. Furthermore, targeted deletion of the Pten tumour suppressor gene in CARNs results in rapid carcinoma formation after androgen-mediated regeneration. These observations indicate that CARNs represent a new luminal stem cell population that is an efficient target for oncogenic transformation in prostate cancer.","[Wang, Xi; Kruithof-de Julio, Marianna; Shen, Michael M.] Columbia Univ Coll Phys & Surg, Dept Med, New York, NY 10032 USA; [Wang, Xi; Kruithof-de Julio, Marianna; Shen, Michael M.] Columbia Univ Coll Phys & Surg, Dept Genet & Dev, New York, NY 10032 USA; [Abate-Shen, Cory] Columbia Univ Coll Phys & Surg, Dept Urol, New York, NY 10032 USA; [Abate-Shen, Cory] Columbia Univ Coll Phys & Surg, Dept Pathol & Cell Biol, Herbert Irving Comprehens Canc Ctr, New York, NY 10032 USA; [Wang, Xi; Economides, Kyriakos D.; Walker, David; Yu, Hailong; Halili, M.

If stars were to keep their angular momentum throughout their evolution, their white-dwarf descendants, owing to their compact nature, should all rotate relatively rapidly, with typical periods of the order of a few seconds. Observations of their photospheres show, in contrast, that they rotate much more slowly, with periods ranging from hours to tens of years(2-5). It is not known, however, whether a white dwarf could 'hide' some of its original angular momentum below the superficial layers, perhaps spinning much more rapidly inside than at its surface. Here we report a determination of the internal rotation profile of a white dwarf using a method based on asteroseismology. We show that the pulsating white dwarf PG 1159-035 rotates as a solid body (encompassing more than 97.5% of its mass) with the relatively long period of 33.61 +/- 0.59 h. This implies that it has lost essentially all of its angular momentum, thus favouring theories which suggest important angular momentum transfer and loss in evolutionary phases before the white-dwarf stage(6,7).","[Fontaine, G.; Brassard, P.] Univ Montreal, Dept Phys, Montreal, PQ H3C 3J7, Canada; [Charpinet, S.] Univ Toulouse, CNRS, Lab Astrophys Toulouse Tarbes, F-31400 Toulouse, France","Fontaine, G (reprint author), Univ Montreal, Dept Phys, CP 6128,Succ Ctr Ville, Montreal, PQ H3C 3J7, Canada.",fontaine@astro.umontreal.ca,,"Charpinet, Stephane/0000-0002-6018-6180",NSERC (Canada); FQRNT (Quebec); Canada Research Chair Program,This work was supported in part by the NSERC (Canada) and in part by the FQRNT (Quebec).

Therefore, hidden classical processes have been considered as possibly predetermining measurement outcomes while preserving their statistical distributions(1). However, a quantitative measure that can distinguish classically determined correlations from stronger quantum correlations exists in the form of the Bell inequalities, measurements of which provide strong experimental evidence that quantum mechanics provides a complete description(2-4). Here we demonstrate the violation of a Bell inequality in a solid-state system. We use a pair of Josephson phase qubits(5-7) acting as spin-1/2 particles, and show that the qubits can be entangled(8,9) and measured so as to violate the Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) version of the Bell inequality(10). We measure a Bell signal of 2.0732 +/- 0.0003, exceeding the maximum amplitude of 2 for a classical system by 244 standard deviations. In the experiment, we deterministically generate the entangled state, and measure both qubits in a single-shot manner, closing the detection loophole(11). Because the Bell inequality was designed to test for non-classical behaviour without assuming the applicability of quantum mechanics to the system in question, this experiment provides further strong evidence that a macroscopic electrical circuit is really a quantum system(7).","[Ansmann, Markus; Wang, H.; Bialczak, Radoslaw C.; Hofheinz, Max; Lucero, Erik; Neeley, M.; O'Connell, A.

Distinct characteristics in the carbon isotope signatures of the major carbon reservoirs (ocean, biosphere, sediments and atmosphere) constrain variations in the CO(2) fluxes between those reservoirs. Here we present a highly resolved atmospheric delta(13)C record for the past 11,000 years from measurements on atmospheric CO(2) trapped in an Antarctic ice core. From mass-balance inverse model calculations(3,4) performed with a simplified carbon cycle model, we show that the decrease in atmospheric CO(2) of about 5 parts per million by volume (p.p.m.v.). The increase in delta(13)C of about 0.25 parts per thousand during the early Holocene is most probably the result of a combination of carbon uptake of about 290 gigatonnes of carbon by the land biosphere and carbon release from the ocean in response to carbonate compensation of the terrestrial uptake during the termination of the last ice age. The 20 p.p.m.v. increase of atmospheric CO(2) and the small decrease in delta(13)C of about 0.05 parts per thousand during the later Holocene can mostly be explained by contributions from carbonate compensation of earlier land-biosphere uptake and coral reef formation, with only a minor contribution from a small decrease of the land-biosphere carbon inventory.","[Elsig, Joachim; Schmitt, Jochen; Leuenberger, Daiana; Schneider, Robert; Eyer, Marc; Leuenberger, Markus; Joos, Fortunat; Fischer, Hubertus; Stocker, Thomas F.] Univ Bern, Inst Phys, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland; [Elsig, Joachim; Schmitt, Jochen; Leuenberger, Daiana; Schneider, Robert; Eyer, Marc; Leuenberger, Markus; Joos, Fortunat; Fischer, Hubertus; Stocker, Thomas F.] Univ Bern, Oeschger Ctr Climate Change Res, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland; [Schmitt, Jochen; Fischer, Hubertus] Alfred Wegener Inst Polar & Marine Res AWI, D-27568 Bremerhaven, Germany","Stocker, TF (reprint author), Univ Bern, Inst Phys, Sidlerstr 5, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland.",stocker@climate.unibe.ch,"; Schmitt, Jochen/B-7893-2009; Fischer, Hubertus/A-1211-2014; Stocker, Thomas/B-1273-2013; Leuenberger, Markus/K-9655-2016","Joos, Fortunat/0000-0002-9483-6030; Schmitt, Jochen/0000-0003-4695-3029; Fischer, Hubertus/0000-0002-2787-4221; Leuenberger, Markus/0000-0003-4299-6793","EU (EPICA-MIS); national contributions from Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom; Swiss NSF; DFG priority programme INTERDYNAMIK; German climate programme DEKLIM","This work is a contribution to the European Project for Ice Coring in Antarctica (EPICA), a joint European Science Foundation/European Commission scientific programme, funded by the EU (EPICA-MIS) and by national contributions from Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom.

Understanding changes in the frequency or characteristics of El Nino events in a changing climate is therefore of broad scientific and socioeconomic interest. Recent studies(1-5) show that the canonical El Nino has become less frequent and that a different kind of El Nino has become more common during the late twentieth century, in which warm sea surface temperatures (SSTs) in the central Pacific are flanked on the east and west by cooler SSTs. This type of El Nino, termed the central Pacific El Nino (CP-El Nino; also termed the dateline El Nino(2), El Nino Modoki(3) or warm pool El Nino(5)), differs from the canonical eastern Pacific El Nino (EP-El Nino) in both the location of maximum SST anomalies and tropical-midlatitude teleconnections. Here we show changes in the ratio of CP-El Nino to EP-El Nino under projected global warming scenarios from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 3 multi-model data set(6). Using calculations based on historical El Nino indices, we find that projections of anthropogenic climate change are associated with an increased frequency of the CP-El Nino compared to the EP-El Nino. When restricted to the six climate models with the best representation of the twentieth-century ratio of CP-El Nino to EP-El Nino, the occurrence ratio of CP-El Nino/EP-El Nino is projected to increase as much as five times under global warming. The change is related to a flattening of the thermocline in the equatorial Pacific.","[Yeh, Sang-Wook; Kug, Jong-Seong] Korea Ocean Res & Dev Inst, Climate Change & Coastal Disaster Res Dept, Ansan 426744, South Korea; [Dewitte, Boris] Lab Etud Geophys & Oceanog Spatiale, F-31400 Toulouse, France; [Kwon, Min-Ho; Jin, Fei-Fei] Univ Hawaii, Sch Ocean & Earth Sci & Technol, Dept Meteorol, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; [Kirtman, Ben P.] Univ Miami, Rosenstiel Sch Marine & Atmospher Sci, Miami, FL 33149 USA","Yeh, SW (reprint author), Korea Ocean Res & Dev Inst, Climate Change & Coastal Disaster Res Dept, Ansan 426744, South Korea.",swyeh@kordi.re.kr,"KUG, JONG-SEONG/A-8053-2013; Yeh, Sang-Wook/G-3007-2014","Yeh, Sang-Wook/0000-0003-4549-1686; Dewitte, Boris/0000-0003-3817-8691","KORDI [PE98401, PP00720]; PCCC project; ANR (Agence Nationale de la Recherche); NSF [ATM 060552, AMT 065145]; NOAA [GC01-229]","We acknowledge the international modelling groups for providing their data and PCMDI and the IPCC Data Archive at LLNL/DOE for collecting, archiving and making the data readily available.

Most previous work on the reversibility of morphological and life-history evolution(9-13) has been indecisive, because of uncertainty and bias in the methods used to infer ancestral states for such characters(14,15). Further, despite theoretical work on the factors that could contribute to irreversibility(1,8,16), there is little empirical evidence on its causes, because sufficient understanding of the mechanistic basis for the evolution of new or ancestral phenotypes is seldom available(3,8,17). By studying the reversibility of evolutionary changes in protein structure and function, these limitations can be overcome. Here we show, using the evolution of hormone specificity in the vertebrate glucocorticoid receptor as a case-study, that the evolutionary path by which this protein acquired its new function soon became inaccessible to reverse exploration. Using ancestral gene reconstruction, protein engineering and X-ray crystallography, we demonstrate that five subsequent 'restrictive' mutations, which optimized the new specificity of the glucocorticoid receptor, also destabilized elements of the protein structure that were required to support the ancestral conformation. Unless these ratchet-like epistatic substitutions are restored to their ancestral states, reversing the key function-switching mutations yields a non-functional protein. Reversing the restrictive substitutions first, however, does nothing to enhance the ancestral function. Our findings indicate that even if selection for the ancestral function were imposed, direct reversal would be extremely unlikely, suggesting an important role for historical contingency in protein evolution.","[Bridgham, Jamie T.; Thornton, Joseph W.] Univ Oregon, Ctr Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Eugene, OR 97403 USA; [Thornton, Joseph W.] Univ Oregon, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Eugene, OR 97403 USA; [Ortlund, Eric A.] Emory Univ, Sch Med, Dept Biochem, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA","Thornton, JW (reprint author), Univ Oregon, Ctr Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Eugene, OR 97403 USA.",joet@uoregon.edu,"Ortlund, Eric/F-4672-2014","Ortlund, Eric/0000-0001-8855-3029","National Science Foundation [IOB-0546906]; National Institutes of Health [R01-GM081592, F32-GM074398]; Sloan Foundation Fellowship","Supported by National Science Foundation IOB-0546906, National Institutes of Health R01-GM081592 and F32-GM074398, and a Sloan Foundation Fellowship to J.

This heterogeneity has been measured for gene transcription, phosphorylation, cell morphology and drug perturbations, and used to explain various aspects of cellular physiology(4-6).

Here we analyse, for the first time, the heterogeneous patterns of related cellular activities, namely virus infection, endocytosis and membrane lipid composition in adherent human cells. We reveal correlations with specific cellular states that are defined by the population context of a cell, and we derive probabilistic models that can explain and predict most cellular heterogeneity of these activities, solely on the basis of each cell's population context. We find that accounting for population-determined heterogeneity is essential for interpreting differences between the activity levels of cell populations. Finally, we reveal that synergy between two molecular components, focal adhesion kinase and the sphingolipid GM1, enhances the population-determined pattern of simian virus 40 (SV40) infection.

During development, excitatory projection neurons originating from the proliferative units at the ventricular surface of the embryonic cerebral vesicles migrate along elongated radial glial fibres(4) to form a cellular infrastructure of radial (vertical) ontogenetic columns in the overlaying cortical plate(5). However, a subpopulation of these clonally related neurons also undergoes a short lateral shift and transfers from their parental to the neighbouring radial glial fibres(6), and intermixes with neurons originating from neighbouring proliferative units(5,7). This columnar organization acts as the primary information processing unit in the cortex(1,8,9). The molecular mechanisms, role and significance of this lateral dispersion for cortical development are not understood. Here we show that an Eph receptor A (EphA) and ephrin A (Efna) signalling-dependent shift in the allocation of clonally related neurons is essential for the proper assembly of cortical columns. In contrast to the relatively uniform labelling of the developing cortical plate by various molecular markers and retrograde tracers in wild-type mice, we found alternating labelling of columnar compartments in Efna knockout mice that are caused by impaired lateral dispersion of migrating neurons rather than by altered cell production or death. Furthermore, in utero electroporation showed that lateral dispersion depends on the expression levels of EphAs and ephrin-As during neuronal migration. This so far unrecognized mechanism for lateral neuronal dispersion seems to be essential for the proper intermixing of neuronal types in the cortical columns, which, when disrupted, might contribute to neuropsychiatric disorders associated with abnormal columnar organization(8,10).","[Torii, Masaaki; Hashimoto-Torii, Kazue; Rakic, Pasko] Yale Univ, Sch Med, Dept Neurobiol, New Haven, CT 06510 USA; [Torii, Masaaki; Hashimoto-Torii, Kazue; Rakic, Pasko] Yale Univ, Sch Med, Kavli Inst Neurosci, New Haven, CT 06510 USA; [Torii, Masaaki; Levitt, Pat] Univ So Calif, Keck Sch Med, Zilkha Neurogenet Inst, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA; [Torii, Masaaki; Levitt, Pat] Univ So Calif, Keck Sch Med, Dept Cell & Neurobiol, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA","Rakic, P (reprint author), Yale Univ, Sch Med, Dept Neurobiol, 333 Cedar St, New Haven, CT 06510 USA.",masaaki.torii@yale.edu; pasko.rakic@yale.edu,,,NARSAD Young Investigator Award; Kavli Institute for Neuroscience at Yale; National Institutes of Health,"We are grateful to T.

Although several possible sources of contagion have been identified in excretions and secretions from symptomatic animals(5-8), the biological importance of these sources in sustaining epidemics remains unclear. Here we show that asymptomatic CWD-infected mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) excrete CWD prions in their faeces long before they develop clinical signs of prion disease. Intracerebral inoculation of irradiated deer faeces into transgenic mice overexpressing cervid prion protein (PrP) revealed infectivity in 14 of 15 faecal samples collected from five deer at 7-11 months before the onset of neurological disease. Although prion concentrations in deer faeces were considerably lower than in brain tissue from the same deer collected at the end of the disease, the estimated total infectious dose excreted in faeces by an infected deer over the disease course may approximate the total contained in a brain. Prolonged faecal prion excretion by infected deer provides a plausible natural mechanism that might explain the high incidence and efficient horizontal transmission of CWD within deer herds(3,4,9), as well as prion transmission among other susceptible cervids.","[Tamgueney, Gueltekin; Palmer, Christina; DeArmond, Stephen J.; Prusiner, Stanley B.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Inst Neurodegenerat Dis, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; [Tamgueney, Gueltekin; Prusiner, Stanley B.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Neurol, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; [Miller, Michael W.; Wolfe, Lisa L.; Sirochman, Tracey M.] Colorado Div Wildlife, Wildlife Res Lab, Ft Collins, CO 80526 USA; [Glidden, David V.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Epidemiol & Biostat, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; [Lemus, Azucena; DeArmond, Stephen J.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Pathol, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA","Prusiner, SB (reprint author), Univ Calif San Francisco, Inst Neurodegenerat Dis, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA.",stanley@ind.ucsf.edu,,"Tamguney, Gultekin/0000-0002-6933-5154",Colorado Division of Wildlife; US Department of Defense National Prion Research Program [NP020152]; National Institutes of Health [AG02132]; Hillblom Foundation,"G.

Here we show that Fgf8 morphogen gradients in living zebrafish embryos are established andmaintained by two essential factors: fast, free diffusion of single molecules away from the source through extracellular space, and a sink function of the receiving cells, regulated by receptor-mediated endocytosis. Evidence is provided by directly examining single molecules of Fgf8 in living tissue by fluorescence correlation spectroscopy, quantifying their local mobility and concentration with high precision. By changing the degree of uptake of Fgf8 into its target cells, we are able to alter the shape of the Fgf8 gradient.

In the mammalian haematopoietic system, haematopoietic stem cells contain low levels of ROS. However, unexpectedly, the common myeloid progenitors (CMPs) produce significantly increased levels of ROS(2). The functional significance of this difference in ROS level in the two progenitor types remains unresolved(2,3). Here we show that Drosophila multipotent haematopoietic progenitors, which are largely akin to the mammalian myeloid progenitors(4), display increased levels of ROS under in vivo physiological conditions, which are downregulated on differentiation. Scavenging the ROS from these haematopoietic progenitors by using in vivo genetic tools retards their differentiation into mature blood cells. Conversely, increasing the haematopoietic progenitor ROS beyond their basal level triggers precocious differentiation into all three mature blood cell types found in Drosophila, through a signalling pathway that involves JNK and FoxO activation as well as Polycomb downregulation. We conclude that the developmentally regulated, moderately high ROS level in the progenitor population sensitizes them to differentiation, and establishes a signalling role for ROS in the regulation of haematopoietic cell fate. Our results lead to a model that could be extended to reveal a probable signalling role for ROS in the differentiation of CMPs in mammalian haematopoietic development and oxidative stress response.","[Owusu-Ansah, Edward; Banerjee, Utpal] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Mol Cell & Dev Biol, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Banerjee, Utpal] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Inst Mol Biol, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Banerjee, Utpal] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Biol Chem, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Banerjee, Utpal] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Eli & Edythe Broad Ctr Regenerat Med & Stem Cell, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA","Banerjee, U (reprint author), Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Mol Cell & Dev Biol, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.",banerjee@mbi.ucla.edu,,,US National Institutes of Health [R01HL067395]; T32 institutional postdoctoral fellowship [T32-HL069766],"We thank I.

Activation of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) by the binding of growth factors initiates GTP loading of RAS, which triggers the initial steps in the activation of the ERK pathway by modulating RAF family kinase function. Once activated, RAF participates in a sequential cascade of phosphorylation events that activate MEK, and in turn ERK. Unbridled signalling through the ERK pathway caused by activating mutations in RTKs, RAS or RAF has been linked to several human cancers(2). Of note, one member of the RAF family, BRAF, is the most frequently mutated oncogene in the kinase superfamily(3). Not surprisingly, there has been a colossal effort to understand the underlying regulation of this family of kinases. In particular, the process by which the RAF kinase domain becomes activated towards its substrate MEK remains of topical interest. Here, using Drosophila Schneider S2 cells, we demonstrate that RAF catalytic function is regulated in response to a specific mode of dimerization of its kinase domain, which we term the side-to-side dimer. Moreover, we find that the RAF-related pseudo-kinase KSR ( kinase suppressor of Ras) also participates in forming side-to-side heterodimers with RAF and can thereby trigger RAF activation. This mechanism provides an elegant explanation for the longstanding conundrumabout RAF catalytic activation, and also provides an explanation for the capacity of KSR, despite lacking catalytic function, to directly mediate RAF activation. We also show that RAF side-to-side dimer formation is essential for aberrant signalling by oncogenic BRAF mutants, and identify an oncogenic mutation that acts specifically by promoting side-to-side dimerization. Together, our data identify the side-to-side dimer interface of RAF as a potential therapeutic target for intervention in BRAF-dependent tumorigenesis.","[Rajakulendran, Thanashan; Sicheri, Frank] Mt Sinai Hosp, Samuel Lunenfeld Res Inst, Ctr Syst Biol, Toronto, ON M5G 1X5, Canada; [Rajakulendran, Thanashan; Sicheri, Frank] Univ Toronto, Dept Mol Genet, Toronto, ON M5S 1A8, Canada; [Sahmi, Malha; Lefrancois, Martin; Therrien, Marc] Univ Montreal, Inst Res Immunol & Canc, Lab Intracellular Signaling, Montreal, PQ H3C 3J7, Canada; [Therrien, Marc] Univ Montreal, Dept Pathol & Biol Cellular, Montreal, PQ H3C 3J7, Canada","Sicheri, F (reprint author), Mt Sinai Hosp, Samuel Lunenfeld Res Inst, Ctr Syst Biol, 600 Univ Ave, Toronto, ON M5G 1X5, Canada.",sicheri@lunenfeld.ca; marc.therrien@umontreal.ca,"Sicheri, Frank/F-8856-2013",,Canadian Institutes for Health Research [MOP-36399]; Canadian Cancer Society [018046]; Research Fellow of The Terry Fox Foundation [019684]; National Cancer Institute of Canada Scientist award; Canada Research Chair,"We thank members of the F.

Accordingly, miRNA biogenesis is highly regulated, controlled at both transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels(2), and overexpression and underexpression of miRNAs are linked to various human diseases, particularly cancers(1,3). As RNA concentrations are generally a function of biogenesis and turnover, active miRNA degradation might also modulate miRNA accumulation, and the plant 3'-> 5' exonuclease SDN1 has been implicated in miRNA turnover(4). Here we report that degradation of mature miRNAs in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, mediated by the 5'-> 3' exoribonuclease XRN-2, affects functional miRNA homeostasis in vivo. We recapitulate XRN-2-dependent miRNA turnover in larval lysates, where processing of precursor-miRNA (pre-miRNA) by Dicer, unannealing of the miRNA duplex and loading of the mature miRNA into the Argonaute protein of the miRNA-induced silencing complex (miRISC) are coupled processes that precede degradation of the mature miRNA. Although Argonaute: miRNA complexes are highly resistant to salt, larval lysate promotes efficient release of the miRNA, exposing it to degradation by XRN-2. Release and degradation can both be blocked by the addition of miRNA target RNA. Our results therefore suggest the presence of an additional layer of regulation of animal miRNA activity that might be important for rapid changes of miRNA expression profiles during developmental transitions and for the maintenance of steady-state concentrations of miRNAs. This pathway might represent a potential target for therapeutic intervention on miRNA expression.","[Chatterjee, Saibal; Grosshans, Helge] Friedrich Miescher Inst Biomed Res, CH-4002 Basel, Switzerland","Grosshans, H (reprint author), Friedrich Miescher Inst Biomed Res, POB 2543, CH-4002 Basel, Switzerland.",helge.grosshans@fmi.ch,,"Grosshans, Helge/0000-0002-8169-6905",Marie Curie; EMBO,We thank M.

Most membrane proteins are recognized and targeted co-translationally by the signal recognition particle. However, nearly 5% of membrane proteins are 'tail-anchored' by a single carboxy-terminal transmembrane domain that cannot access the co-translational pathway. Instead, tail-anchored proteins are targeted post-translationally by a conserved ATPase termed Get3. The mechanistic basis for tail-anchored protein recognition or targeting by Get3 is not known. Here we present crystal structures of yeast Get3 in 'open' (nucleotide-free) and 'closed' (ADP center dot AlF(4)(-)-bound) dimer states. In the closed state, the dimer interface of Get3 contains an enormous hydrophobic groove implicated by mutational analyses in tail-anchored protein binding. In the open state, Get3 undergoes a striking rearrangement that disrupts the groove and shields its hydrophobic surfaces. These data provide a molecular mechanism for nucleotide-regulated binding and release of tail-anchored proteins during their membrane targeting by Get3.","[Mateja, Agnieszka; Szlachcic, Anna; Downing, Maureen E.; Dobosz, Malgorzata; Keenan, Robert J.] Univ Chicago, Dept Biochem & Mol Biol, Gordon Ctr Integrat Sci, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Mariappan, Malaiyalam; Hegde, Ramanujan S.] Eunice Kennedy Shriver Natl Inst Child Hlth & Hum, Cell Biol & Metab Program, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Szlachcic, Anna] Univ Wroclaw, Fac Biotechnol, Dept Prot Engn, PL-50137 Wroclaw, Poland; [Dobosz, Malgorzata] Jagiellonian Univ, Fac Chem, PL-30060 Krakow, Poland","Keenan, RJ (reprint author), Univ Chicago, Dept Biochem & Mol Biol, Gordon Ctr Integrat Sci, Room W238,920 E 57th St, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.",bkeenan@uchicago.edu,"mariappan, malaiyalam/K-9024-2012","Hegde, Ramanujan/0000-0001-8338-852X","US Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences [DE-AC02-06CH11357]; Edward Mallinckrodt, Jr. Foundation; National Institutes of Health","Data were collected at beamlines 21-IDG and 23-IDD at the Advanced Photon Source (APS), Argonne National Laboratory, and we thank the beamline staff for support.

Unlike the nuclear genome, which is derived from both the egg and sperm at fertilization, the mtDNA in the embryo is derived almost exclusively from the egg; that is, it is of maternal origin. Mutations in mtDNA contribute to a diverse range of currently incurable human diseases and disorders. To establish preclinical models for new therapeutic approaches, we demonstrate here that the mitochondrial genome can be efficiently replaced in mature non-human primate oocytes (Macaca mulatta) by spindle-chromosomal complex transfer from one egg to an enucleated, mitochondrial-replete egg. The reconstructed oocytes with the mitochondrial replacement were capable of supporting normal fertilization, embryo development and produced healthy offspring. Genetic analysis confirmed that nuclear DNA in the three infants born so far originated from the spindle donors whereas mtDNA came from the cytoplast donors. No contribution of spindle donor mtDNA was detected in offspring. Spindle replacement is shown here as an efficient protocol replacing the full complement of mitochondria in newly generated embryonic stem cell lines. This approach may offer a reproductive option to prevent mtDNA disease transmission in affected families.","[Tachibana, Masahito; Sparman, Michelle; Sritanaudomchai, Hathaitip; Ma, Hong; Clepper, Lisa; Woodward, Joy; Li, Ying; Ramsey, Cathy; Kolotushkina, Olena; Mitalipov, Shoukhrat] Oregon Hlth & Sci Univ, Oregon Natl Primate Res Ctr, Beaverton, OR 97006 USA; [Mitalipov, Shoukhrat] Oregon Hlth & Sci Univ, Oregon Stem Cell Ctr, Beaverton, OR 97006 USA; [Mitalipov, Shoukhrat] Oregon Hlth & Sci Univ, Dept Obstet & Gynecol, Beaverton, OR 97006 USA; [Mitalipov, Shoukhrat] Oregon Hlth & Sci Univ, Dept Mol & Med Genet, Beaverton, OR 97006 USA","Mitalipov, S (reprint author), Oregon Hlth & Sci Univ, Oregon Natl Primate Res Ctr, 505 NW 185th Ave, Beaverton, OR 97006 USA.",mitalipo@ohsu.edu,,,Oregon National Primate Research Center; Oregon Stem Cell Center; National Institutes of Health,"The authors acknowledge the Division of Animal Resources, Surgical Team, Endocrine Technology Core, Imaging & Morphology Core and Molecular & Cellular Biology Core at the Oregon National Primate Research Center for providing expertise and services that contributed to this project.

For most binaries, the theoretical and observed precession rates are in agreement(1). One system, however-DI Herculis-has resisted explanation for 30 years(2-4). The observed precession rate is a factor of four slower than the theoretical rate, a disagreement that once was interpreted as evidence for a failure of general relativity(5). Among the contemporary explanations are the existence of a circumbinary planet(6) and a large tilt of the stellar spin axes with respect to the orbit(7,8). Here we report that both stars of DI Herculis rotate with their spin axes nearly perpendicular to the orbital axis (contrary to the usual assumption for close binary stars). The rotationally induced stellar oblateness causes precession in the direction opposite to that of relativistic precession, thereby reconciling the theoretical and observed rates.","[Albrecht, Simon; Snellen, Ignas A.

Likewise, electric fields can be used to move liquid drops(4). Electrically induced droplet motion manifests itself in processes as diverse as storm cloud formation(5), commercial ink-jet printing(6), petroleum and vegetable oil dehydration(7), electrospray ionization for use in mass spectrometry(8), electrowetting(9) and lab-on-a-chip manipulations(10). An important issue in practical applications is the tendency for adjacent drops to coalesce, and oppositely charged drops have long been assumed to experience an attractive force that favours their coalescence(11-13). Here we report the existence of a critical field strength above which oppositely charged drops do not coalesce. We observe that appropriately positioned and oppositely charged drops migrate towards one another in an applied electric field; but whereas the drops coalesce as expected at low field strengths, they are repelled from one another after contact at higher field strengths. Qualitatively, the drops appear to 'bounce' off one another. We directly image the transient formation of a meniscus bridge between the bouncing drops, and propose that this temporary bridge is unstable with respect to capillary pressure when it forms in an electric field exceeding a critical strength. The observation of oppositely charged drops bouncing rather than coalescing in strong electric fields should affect our understanding of any process involving charged liquid drops, including de-emulsification, electrospray ionization and atmospheric conduction.","[Ristenpart, W.

The most abundant VOCs emitted by terrestrial vegetation are isoprene and its derivatives, such as monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes(2). New particle formation in boreal regions is related to monoterpene emissions(3) and causes an estimated negative radiative forcing(4) of about -0.2 to -0.9 W m(-2). The annual variation in aerosol growth rates during particle nucleation events correlates with the seasonality of monoterpene emissions of the local vegetation, with a maximum during summer(5). The frequency of nucleation events peaks, however, in spring and autumn(5). Here we present evidence from simulation experiments conducted in a plant chamber that isoprene can significantly inhibit new particle formation. The process leading to the observed decrease in particle number concentration is linked to the high reactivity of isoprene with the hydroxyl radical (OH). The suppression is stronger with higher concentrations of isoprene, but with little dependence on the specific VOC mixture emitted by trees. A parameterization of the observed suppression factor as a function of isoprene concentration suggests that the number of new particles produced depends on the OH concentration and VOCs involved in the production of new particles undergo three to four steps of oxidation by OH. Our measurements simulate conditions that are typical for forested regions and may explain the observed seasonality in the frequency of aerosol nucleation events, with a lower number of nucleation events during summer compared to autumn and spring(5). Biogenic emissions of isoprene are controlled by temperature and light(2), and if the relative isoprene abundance of biogenic VOC emissions increases in response to climate change or land use change, the new particle formation potential may decrease, thus damping the aerosol negative radiative forcing effect.","[Kiendler-Scharr, Astrid; Dal Maso, Miikka; Hohaus, Thorsten; Mentel, Thomas F.; Tillmann, Ralf; Wahner, Andreas] Forschungszentrum Julich, Inst ICG 2, D-52425 Julich, Germany; [Wildt, Juergen; Kleist, Einhard; Uerlings, Ricarda; Schurr, Uli] Forschungszentrum Julich, Inst ICG 3, D-52425 Julich, Germany; [Dal Maso, Miikka] Univ Helsinki, Dept Phys, Helsinki 00014, Finland","Kiendler-Scharr, A (reprint author), Forschungszentrum Julich, Inst ICG 2, Postfach 1913, D-52425 Julich, Germany.",a.kiendler-scharr@fz-juelich.de,"Dal Maso, Miikka/A-7980-2008; Kiendler-Scharr, Astrid/E-8439-2011; Tillmann, Ralf/I-9203-2012; Wahner, Andreas/J-4129-2012; Hohaus, Thorsten/N-5507-2015; Mentel, Thomas/A-3576-2011","Dal Maso, Miikka/0000-0003-3040-3612; Kiendler-Scharr, Astrid/0000-0003-3166-2253; Tillmann, Ralf/0000-0003-0648-6622; Wahner, Andreas/0000-0001-8948-1928; Hohaus, Thorsten/0000-0001-5722-6244; Mentel, Thomas/0000-0003-0810-3541",European Commission [036833-2],"We gratefully acknowledge support by the European Commission (IP-EUCAARI, contract number 036833-2).",,29,122,124,10,111,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,17-Sep,2009,461,7262,,,,,381,384,,10.1038/nature08292,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,494QB,WOS:000269828100036,19759617,No,,,11/20/17

Studying the response of the GIS to past climatic change may help to advance our understanding of GIS dynamics. The previous interpretation of evidence from stable isotopes (delta O-18) in water from GIS ice cores was that Holocene climate variability on the GIS differed spatially(3) and that a consistent Holocene climate optimum-the unusually warm period from about 9,000 to 6,000 years ago found in many northern-latitude palaeoclimate records(4)-did not exist. Here we extract both the Greenland Holocene temperature history and the evolution of GIS surface elevation at four GIS locations. We achieve this by comparing delta O-18 from GIS ice cores(3,5) with delta O-18 from ice cores from small marginal icecaps. Contrary to the earlier interpretation of delta O-18 evidence from ice cores(3,6), our new temperature history reveals a pronounced Holocene climatic optimum in Greenland coinciding with maximum thinning near the GIS margins. Our delta O-18-based results are corroborated by the air content of ice cores, a proxy for surface elevation(7). State-of-the-art ice sheet models are generally found to be underestimating the extent and changes in GIS elevation and area; our findings may help to improve the ability of models to reproduce the GIS response to Holocene climate.","[Vinther, B.

The mechanism by which a species determines the sex of its offspring has been linked to critical ecological and life-history traits(1-3) but not to major adaptive radiations, in part because sex-determining mechanisms do not fossilize. Here we establish a previously unknown coevolutionary relationship in 94 amniote species between sex-determining mechanism and whether a species bears live young or lays eggs. We use that relationship to predict the sex-determining mechanism in three independent lineages of extinct Mesozoic marine reptiles (mosasaurs, sauropterygians and ichthyosaurs), each of which is known from fossils to have evolved live birth(4-7). Our results indicate that each lineage evolved genotypic sex determination before acquiring live birth. This enabled their pelagic radiations, where the relatively stable temperatures of the open ocean constrain temperature-dependent sex determination in amniote species. Freed from the need to move and nest on land(4,5,8), extreme physical adaptations to a pelagic lifestyle evolved in each group, such as the fluked tails, dorsal fins and wing-shaped limbs of ichthyosaurs. With the inclusion of ichthyosaurs, mosasaurs and sauropterygians, genotypic sex determination is present in all known fully pelagic amniote groups (sea snakes, sirenians and cetaceans), suggesting that this mode of sex determination and the subsequent evolution of live birth are key traits required for marine adaptive radiations in amniote lineages.","[Organ, Chris L.; Janes, Daniel E.] Harvard Univ, Museum Comparat Zool, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Meade, Andrew; Pagel, Mark] Univ Reading, Sch Biol Sci, Reading RG6 6AJ, Berks, England","Organ, CL (reprint author), Harvard Univ, Museum Comparat Zool, 26 Oxford St, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",corgan@oeb.harvard.edu; m.pagel@reading.ac.uk,,,"Museum of Comparative Zoology; National Institutes of Health [1 F32 GM075490-01, 5 F32 GM072494]; Natural Environment Research Council [NE/C51992X/1]","We thank M.

As the agent of the Irish potato famine in the mid-nineteenth century, P. infestans has had a tremendous effect on human history, resulting in famine and population displacement(1). To this day, it affects world agriculture by causing the most destructive disease of potato, the fourth largest food crop and a critical alternative to the major cereal crops for feeding the world's population(1). Current annual worldwide potato crop losses due to late blight are conservatively estimated at $6.7 billion(2). Management of this devastating pathogen is challenged by its remarkable speed of adaptation to control strategies such as genetically resistant cultivars(3,4). Here we report the sequence of the P. infestans genome, which at similar to 240 megabases (Mb) is by far the largest and most complex genome sequenced so far in the chromalveolates. Its expansion results from a proliferation of repetitive DNA accounting for similar to 74% of the genome. Comparison with two other Phytophthora genomes showed rapid turnover and extensive expansion of specific families of secreted disease effector proteins, including many genes that are induced during infection or are predicted to have activities that alter host physiology. These fast-evolving effector genes are localized to highly dynamic and expanded regions of the P. infestans genome. This probably plays a crucial part in the rapid adaptability of the pathogen to host plants and underpins its evolutionary potential.","[Kamoun, Sophien; Cano, Liliana M.; Raffaele, Sylvain; Bozkurt, Tolga O.; Jones, Alexandra M.

Although the recommended treatment for chronic infection involves a 48-week course of peginterferon-alpha-2b (PegIFN-alpha-2b) or-alpha-2a (PegIFN-alpha-2a) combined with ribavirin (RBV), it is well known that many patients will not be cured by treatment, and that patients of European ancestry have a significantly higher probability of being cured than patients of African ancestry. In addition to limited efficacy, treatment is often poorly tolerated because of side effects that prevent some patients from completing therapy. For these reasons, identification of the determinants of response to treatment is a high priority. Here we report that a genetic polymorphism near the IL28B gene, encoding interferon-lambda-3 (IFN-lambda-3), is associated with an approximately twofold change in response to treatment, both among patients of European ancestry (P = 1.06 x 10(-25)) and African-Americans (P = 2.06 x 10(-3)). Because the genotype leading to better response is in substantially greater frequency in European than African populations, this genetic polymorphism also explains approximately half of the difference in response rates between African-Americans and patients of European ancestry.","[Ge, Dongliang; Fellay, Jacques; Shianna, Kevin V.; Urban, Thomas J.; Heinzen, Erin L.; Goldstein, David B.] Duke Univ, Ctr Human Genome Variat, Inst Genome Sci & Policy, Durham, NC 27708 USA; [Thompson, Alexander J.; Muir, Andrew J.; McHutchison, John G.] Duke Univ, Duke Clin Res Inst, Durham, NC 27705 USA; [Thompson, Alexander J.; Muir, Andrew J.; McHutchison, John G.] Duke Univ, Div Gastroenterol, Sch Med, Durham, NC 27705 USA; [Simon, Jason S.; Qiu, Ping; Bertelsen, Arthur H.] Schering Plough Res Inst, Kenilworth, NJ 07033 USA; [Sulkowski, Mark] Johns Hopkins Univ, Sch Med, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA","Goldstein, DB (reprint author), Duke Univ, Ctr Human Genome Variat, Inst Genome Sci & Policy, Durham, NC 27708 USA.",d.goldstein@duke.edu,"Ge, Dongliang/A-2073-2010; Fellay, Jacques/A-6681-2009","Fellay, Jacques/0000-0002-8240-939X",National Health and Medical Research Council of Australia; Gastroenterological Society of Australia,"We are indebted to the IDEAL principal investigators, the study coordinators, nurses and patients involved in the study.

Recent studies have reported the derivation and differentiation of disease-specific human iPSCs(4-7). However, a key challenge in the field is the demonstration of disease-related phenotypes and the ability to model pathogenesis and treatment of disease in iPSCs. Familial dysautonomia (FD) is a rare but fatal peripheral neuropathy, caused by a point mutation in the IKBKAP(8) gene involved in transcriptional elongation(9). The disease is characterized by the depletion of autonomic and sensory neurons. The specificity to the peripheral nervous system and the mechanism of neuron loss in FD are poorly understood owing to the lack of an appropriate model system. Here we report the derivation of patient-specific FD-iPSCs and the directed differentiation into cells of all three germ layers including peripheral neurons. Gene expression analysis in purified FD-iPSC-derived lineages demonstrates tissue-specific mis-splicing of IKBKAP in vitro. Patient-specific neural crest precursors express particularly low levels of normal IKBKAP transcript, suggesting a mechanism for disease specificity. FD pathogenesis is further characterized by transcriptome analysis and cell-based assays revealing marked defects in neurogenic differentiation and migration behaviour. Furthermore, we use FD-iPSCs for validating the potency of candidate drugs in reversing aberrant splicing and ameliorating neuronal differentiation and migration. Our study illustrates the promise of iPSC technology for gaining new insights into human disease pathogenesis and treatment.","[Papapetrou, Eirini P.; Tomishima, Mark J.; Tabar, Viviane; Sadelain, Michel; Studer, Lorenz] Sloan Kettering Inst, Ctr Cell Engn, New York, NY 10065 USA; [Lee, Gabsang; Kim, Hyesoo; Chambers, Stuart M.; Tomishima, Mark J.; Fasano, Christopher A.; Ganat, Yosif M.; Studer, Lorenz] Sloan Kettering Inst, Dev Biol Program, New York, NY 10065 USA; [Tomishima, Mark J.] Sloan Kettering Inst, SKI Stem Cell Res Facil, New York, NY 10065 USA; [Menon, Jayanthi; Shimizu, Fumiko; Tabar, Viviane; Studer, Lorenz] Sloan Kettering Inst, Dept Neurosurg, New York, NY 10065 USA; [Viale, Agnes] Sloan Kettering Inst, Genom Core Facil, New York, NY 10065 USA; [Ganat, Yosif M.] Weill Cornell Grad Sch, New York, NY 10065 USA","Studer, L (reprint author), Sloan Kettering Inst, Dev Biol Program, 1275 York Ave, New York, NY 10065 USA.",studerl@mskcc.org,,,Starr Foundation; NYSTEM; New York Stem Cell Foundation (NYCSF); Druckenmiller fellowships; Starr Scholar fellowship,"We thank J.

In vertebrates, the excitatory synaptic drive for inducing the spinal CPG can originate from either supraspinal glutamatergic inputs or from within the spinal cord(2,3). Here we identify a spinal input to the CPG that drives spontaneous locomotion using a combination of intersectional gene expression and optogenetics(4) in zebrafish larvae. The photo-stimulation of one specific cell type was sufficient to induce a symmetrical tail beating sequence that mimics spontaneous slow forward swimming. This neuron is the Kolmer-Agduhr cell(5), which extends cilia into the central cerebrospinal-fluid-containing canal of the spinal cord and has an ipsilateral ascending axon that terminates in a series of consecutive segments(6). Genetically silencing Kolmer-Agduhr cells reduced the frequency of spontaneous free swimming, indicating that activity of Kolmer-Agduhr cells provides necessary tone for spontaneous forward swimming. Kolmer-Agduhr cells have been known for over 75 years, but their function has been mysterious. Our results reveal that during early development in zebrafish these cells provide a positive drive to the spinal CPG for spontaneous locomotion.","[Wyart, Claire; Warp, Erica; Isacoff, Ehud Y.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Helen Wills Neurosci Inst, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Wyart, Claire; Warp, Erica; Isacoff, Ehud Y.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mol & Cell Biol, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Del Bene, Filippo; Scott, Ethan K.; Baier, Herwig] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Physiol, Program Neurosci, San Francisco, CA 94158 USA; [Trauner, Dirk] Univ Munich, Dept Chem, Munich, Germany; [Isacoff, Ehud Y.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Lawrence Berkeley Lab, Phys Biosci Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Isacoff, Ehud Y.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Lawrence Berkeley Lab, Div Mat Sci, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA","Isacoff, EY (reprint author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Helen Wills Neurosci Inst, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",herwig.baier@ucsf.edu; ehud@berkeley.edu,"Scott, Ethan/F-6693-2015; Wyart, Claire/H-3783-2016","Wyart, Claire/0000-0002-1668-4975; Scott, Ethan/0000-0003-3150-9216; del bene, filippo/0000-0001-8551-2846",Marie Curie Outgoing International Fellowship [CNRS-UMR5020]; Human Frontier Science Program Long-term Postdoctoral Fellowship; National Institutes of Health Nanomedicine Development Center [5PN2EY018241]; Human Frontiers Science Program [RGP23-2005]; Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory Directed Research and Development Program [R01 NS053358]; Sandler Opportunity Award,"We thank M.Volgraf for MAG-1 synthesis, K.Kawakami for the UAS: TeTxLC-CFP line, B.Appel for the Olig2-DsRed line, W.Staub for animal care, D.Li for help with screening BGUG larvae, B.Vigh, C.Girit, E.Brustein, P.Drapeau and S.Hugel for discussions, P.G.de Gennes and Noam Sobel for support and O.Wyart for aesthetic input.We are grateful to K.Best, P.Tavormina, H.Aaron, R.Ayer, B.Nowak and M.Ulbrich for advice on the design of the photostimulation setup.Support for the work was from the Marie Curie Outgoing International Fellowship (with the CNRS-UMR5020 'Neurosciences Sensorielles, Comportement Cognition' laboratory, Lyon, France) (C.W.), the Human Frontier Science Program Long-term Postdoctoral Fellowship (F.D.B.), the National Institutes of Health Nanomedicine Development Center for the Optical Control of Biological Function (5PN2EY018241) (E.Y.I., D.T.and H.B.), the Human Frontiers Science Program (RGP23-2005) (E.Y.I.and D.T.), the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory Directed Research and Development Program (E.Y.I.and D.T.), R01 NS053358 (H.B.) and a Sandler Opportunity Award (H.B.).",,31,208,215,4,66,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,17-Sep,2009,461,7262,,,,,407,U105,,10.1038/nature08323,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,494QB,WOS:000269828100042,19759620,No,,,11/20/17

Nf1 encodes neurofibromin, a GTPase-activating protein that terminates Ras signalling by stimulating hydrolysis of Ras-GTP. We compared the effects of inhibitors of MEK in a myeloproliferative disorder (MPD) initiated by inactivating Nf1 in mouse bone marrow and in acute myeloid leukaemias (AMLs) in which cooperating mutations were induced by retroviral insertional mutagenesis. Here we show that MEK inhibitors are ineffective in MPD, but induce objective regression of many Nf1-deficient AMLs. Drug resistance developed because of outgrowth of AML clones that were present before treatment. We cloned clone-specific retroviral integrations to identify candidate resistance genes including Rasgrp1, Rasgrp4 and Mapk14, which encodes p38 alpha. Functional analysis implicated increased RasGRP1 levels and reduced p38 kinase activity in resistance to MEK inhibitors.

However, the mechanisms underlying locus-and parental-specific targeting of the de novo DNA methylation machinery in germline imprinting are poorly understood. Here we show that amine oxidase (flavin-containing) domain 1 (AOF1), a protein related to the lysine demethylase KDM1 (also known as LSD1)(6), functions as a histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4) demethylase and is required for de novo DNA methylation of some imprinted genes in oocytes. AOF1, now renamed lysine demethylase 1B (KDM1B) following a new nomenclature(7), is highly expressed in growing oocytes where genomic imprints are established. Targeted disruption of the gene encoding KDM1B had no effect on mouse development and oogenesis. However, oocytes from KDM1B-deficient females showed a substantial increase in H3K4 methylation and failed to set up the DNA methylation marks at four out of seven imprinted genes examined. Embryos derived from these oocytes showed biallelic expression or biallelic suppression of the affected genes and died before mid-gestation. Our results suggest that demethylation of H3K4 is critical for establishing the DNA methylation imprints during oogenesis.","[Ciccone, David N.; Su, Hui; Hevi, Sarah; Gay, Frederique; Lei, Hong; Bajko, Jeffrey; Li, En; Chen, Taiping] Novartis Inst Biomed Res, Epigenet Program, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Xu, Guoliang] Chinese Acad Sci, Shanghai Inst Biol Sci, Inst Biochem & Cell Biol, State Key Lab Mol Biol, Shanghai 200031, Peoples R China","Chen, TP (reprint author), Novartis Inst Biomed Res, Epigenet Program, 250 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",taiping.chen@novartis.com,,,,,,23,248,260,3,33,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,17-Sep,2009,461,7262,,,,,415,U115,,10.1038/nature08315,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,494QB,WOS:000269828100044,19727073,No,,,11/20/17

However, these transcripts can be deleterious, and their accumulation is suppressed by several mechanisms including degradation by the nuclear exosome(8,9). The mechanisms by which cells differentiate coding RNAs from transcripts targeted for degradation are not clear. Here we show that the variant histone H2A.Z, which is loaded preferentially at the 5' ends of genes by the Swr1 complex containing a JmjC domain protein, mediates suppression of antisense transcripts in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe genome. H2A.Z is partially redundant in this regard with the Clr4 (known as SUV39H in mammals)-containing heterochromatin silencing complex that is also distributed at euchromatic loci, and with RNA interference component Argonaute (Ago1). Loss of Clr4 or Ago1 alone has little effect on antisense transcript levels, but cells lacking either of these factors and H2A.Z show markedly increased levels of antisense RNAs that are normally degraded by the exosome. These analyses suggest that as well as performing other functions, H2A.Z is a component of a genome indexing mechanism that cooperates with heterochromatin and RNAi factors to suppress read-through antisense transcripts.","[Zofall, Martin; Fischer, Tamas; Zhang, Ke; Cui, Bowen; Grewal, Shiv I.

Plants often change the genome size and organization during evolution by rapid proliferation and deletion of long terminal repeat (LTR) retrotransposons(3,4). Precise transposon sequences throughout the Arabidopsis thaliana genome and the trans-acting mutations affecting epigenetic states make it an ideal model organism with which to study transposon dynamics(5-9). Here we report the mobilization of various families of endogenous A. thaliana LTR retrotransposons identified through genetic and genomic approaches with high-resolution genomic tiling arrays and mutants in the chromatin-remodelling gene DDM1 (DECREASE IN DNA METHYLATION1)(10,11). Using multiple lines of self-pollinated ddm1 mutant, we detected an increase in copy number, and verified this for various retrotransposons in a gypsy family (ATGP3) and copia families (ATCOPIA13, ATCOPIA21, ATCOPIA93), and also for a DNA transposon of a Mutator family, VANDAL21. A burst of retrotransposition occurred stochastically and independently for each element, suggesting an additional autocatalytic process. Furthermore, comparison of the identified LTR retrotransposons in related Arabidopsis species revealed that a lineage-specific burst of retrotransposition of these elements did indeed occur in natural Arabidopsis populations. The recent burst of retrotransposition in natural population is targeted to centromeric repeats, which is presumably less harmful than insertion into genes. The ddm1-induced retrotransposon proliferations and genome rearrangements mimic the transposon-mediated genome dynamics during evolution and provide experimental systems with which to investigate the controlling molecular factors directly.","[Tsukahara, Sayuri; Kobayashi, Akie; Kawabe, Akira; Miura, Asuka; Kakutani, Tetsuji] Natl Inst Genet, Dept Integrated Genet, Mishima, Shizuoka 4118540, Japan; [Tsukahara, Sayuri; Kakutani, Tetsuji] Grad Univ Adv Studies, Sch Life Sci, Dept Genet, Mishima, Shizuoka 4118540, Japan; [Mathieu, Olivier] Univ Geneva, Dept Plant Biol, CH-1211 Geneva, Switzerland; [Mathieu, Olivier] Univ Clermont Ferrand, CNRS, INSERMU, GReD,UMR 6247,U931, F-63177 Clermont Ferrand, France","Kakutani, T (reprint author), Natl Inst Genet, Dept Integrated Genet, Yata 1111, Mishima, Shizuoka 4118540, Japan.",tkakutan@lab.nig.ac.jp,,"Mathieu, Olivier/0000-0001-5302-1102; Kawabe, Akira/0000-0001-5770-412X",Takeda Science Foundation,"We thank A.

In plants and mammals, retrotransposons are transcriptionally silenced by DNA methylation(1,4), which in Arabidopsis is propagated at CG dinucleotides by METHYLTRANSFERASE 1 (MET1)(5). In met1 mutants, however, mobilization of retrotransposons is not observed, despite their transcriptional activation(4-6). A post-transcriptional mechanism therefore seems to be preventing retrotransposition. Here we show that a copia-type retrotransposon (Evade, French for 'fugitive') evaded suppression of its movement during inbreeding of hybrid epigenomes consisting of met1-and wild-type-derived chromosomes. Evade (EVD) reinsertions caused a series of developmental mutations that allowed its identification. Genetic testing of host control of the EVD life cycle showed that transcriptional suppression occurred by CG methylation supported by RNA-directed DNA methylation. On transcriptional reactivation, subsequent steps of the EVD cycle were inhibited by plant-specific RNA polymerase IV/V(7,8) and the histone methyltransferase KRYPTONITE (KYP). Moreover, genome resequencing demonstrated retrotransposition of EVD but no other potentially active retroelements when this combination of epigenetic mechanisms was compromised. Our results demonstrate that epigenetic control of retrotransposons extends beyond transcriptional suppression and can be individualized for particular elements.","[Mirouze, Marie; Reinders, Jon; Bucher, Etienne; Nishimura, Taisuke; Paszkowski, Jerzy; Mathieu, Olivier] Univ Geneva, Dept Plant Biol, CH-1211 Geneva 4, Switzerland; [Schneeberger, Korbinian; Ossowski, Stephan; Cao, Jun; Weigel, Detlef] Max Planck Inst Dev Biol, D-72076 Tubingen, Germany; [Mathieu, Olivier] Univ Clermont Ferrand, CNRS, INSERM, GReD,UMR 6247,U931, F-63177 Clermont Ferrand, France","Paszkowski, J (reprint author), Univ Geneva, Dept Plant Biol, Sci III,30 Quai Ernest Ansermet, CH-1211 Geneva 4, Switzerland.",jerzy.paszkowski@unige.ch; olivier.mathieu@univ-bpclermont.fr,"; Weigel, Detlef/C-1418-2008; Ossowski, Stephan/E-2139-2011; Cao, Jun/E-5422-2012; Bucher, Etienne/E-7681-2013","Mirouze, Marie/0000-0002-0514-1270; Weigel, Detlef/0000-0002-2114-7963; Ossowski, Stephan/0000-0002-7416-9568; Bucher, Etienne/0000-0002-3114-3763; Mathieu, Olivier/0000-0001-5302-1102",Swiss National Science Foundation [3100A0-102107]; European Commission [LSHG-CT-2004- 503433]; Targeted Gene Integration in Plants (TAGIP) [018785]; Max Planck Society,"We thank all members of the Paszkowski laboratory for discussion; L.

Although the details of transcriptional regulation are becoming increasingly understood, the mechanism(s) controlling mRNA decay remain unclear. In yeast, a major pathway of mRNA decay begins with deadenylation followed by decapping and 5'-3' exonuclease digestion. Importantly, it is hypothesized that ribosomes must be removed from mRNA before transcripts are destroyed. Contrary to this prediction, here we show that decay takes place while mRNAs are associated with actively translating ribosomes. The data indicate that dissociation of ribosomes from mRNA is not a prerequisite for decay and we suggest that the 5'-3' polarity of mRNA degradation has evolved to ensure that the last translocating ribosome can complete translation.","[Hu, Wenqian; Sweet, Thomas J.; Baker, Kristian E.; Coller, Jeff] Case Western Reserve Univ, Ctr RNA Mol Biol, Cleveland, OH 44106 USA; [Chamnongpol, Sangpen] Affymetrix Inc, Cleveland, OH 44128 USA","Coller, J (reprint author), Case Western Reserve Univ, Ctr RNA Mol Biol, Cleveland, OH 44106 USA.",jmc71@case.edu,,"Coller, Jeff/0000-0001-5662-8110; Hu, Wenqian/0000-0003-3577-3604",American Heart Association; National Institutes of Health,"We thank P.

The Multiband Imager(4) on the Selenological and Engineering Explorer (SELENE)(5) has a high spatial resolution of optimized spectral coverage, which should allow a clear view of the composition of the lunar crust.

Precise and arbitrary control of anoptical field that preserves optical coherence is an important requisite for many proposed photonic technologies. For quantum information applications(1,2), a device that allows storage and on-demand retrieval of arbitrary quantum states of light would form an ideal quantum optical memory. Recently, significant progress has been made in implementing atomic quantum memories using electromagnetically induced transparency, photon echo spectroscopy, off-resonance Raman spectroscopy and other atom-light interaction processes. Single-photon(3,4) and bright-optical-field(5,6) storage with quantum states have both been successfully demonstrated. Here we present a coherent optical memory based on photon echoes induced through controlled reversible inhomogeneous broadening. Our scheme allows storage of multiple pulses of light within a chosen frequency bandwidth, and stored pulses can be recalled in arbitrary order with any chosen delay between each recalled pulse. Furthermore, pulses can be time-compressed, time-stretched or split into multiple smaller pulses and recalled in several pieces at chosen times. Although our experimental results are so far limited to classical light pulses, our technique should enable the construction of an optical random-access memory for time-bin quantum information, and have potential applications in quantum information processing.","[Hosseini, Mahdi; Sparkes, Ben M.; Hetet, Gabriel; Longdell, Jevon J.; Lam, Ping Koy; Buchler, Ben C.] Australian Natl Univ, Dept Quantum Sci, ARC Ctr Excellence Quantum Atom Opt, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia; [Longdell, Jevon J.] Univ Otago, Dept Phys, Dunedin 9016, New Zealand","Buchler, BC (reprint author), Australian Natl Univ, Dept Quantum Sci, ARC Ctr Excellence Quantum Atom Opt, GPO Box 4, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia.",ben.buchler@anu.edu.au,"Hosseini, Mahdi/A-5430-2013; Lam, Ping Koy/A-5276-2008; Sparkes, Benjamin/I-3216-2014; Buchler, Ben/D-4581-2009","Hosseini, Mahdi/0000-0002-2539-1664; Lam, Ping Koy/0000-0002-4421-601X; Sparkes, Benjamin/0000-0002-9370-2006; Buchler, Ben/0000-0002-2852-7483",Australian Research Council,"We thank S.

But the very presence of the micropores, with aperture diameters below 1 nm, often goes hand-in-hand with diffusion limitations(3-5) that adversely affect catalytic activity. The problem can be overcome by reducing the thickness of the zeolite crystals, which reduces diffusion path lengths and thus improves molecular diffusion(4,5). This has been realized by synthesizing zeolite nanocrystals(6), by exfoliating layered zeolites(7-9), and by introducing mesopores in the microporous material through templating strategies(10-17) or demetallation processes(18-22). But except for the exfoliation, none of these strategies has produced 'ultrathin' zeolites with thicknesses below 5 nm. Here we show that appropriately designed bifunctional surfactants can direct the formation of zeolite structures on themesoporous and microporous length scales simultaneously and thus yield MFI (ZSM-5, one of the most important catalysts in the petrochemical industry) zeolite nanosheets that are only 2 nm thick, which corresponds to the b-axis dimension of a single MFI unit cell. The large number of acid sites on the external surface of these zeolites renders them highly active for the catalytic conversion of large organic molecules, and the reduced crystal thickness facilitates diffusion and thereby dramatically suppresses catalyst deactivation through coke deposition during methanol-to-gasoline conversion. We expect that our synthesis approach could be applied to other zeolites to improve their performance in a range of important catalytic applications.","[Choi, Minkee; Na, Kyungsu; Kim, Jeongnam; Ryoo, Ryong] Korea Adv Inst Sci & Technol, Dept Chem, Ctr Funct Nanomat, Taejon 305701, South Korea; [Kim, Jeongnam; Ryoo, Ryong] Korea Adv Inst Sci & Technol, Grad Sch Nanosci & Technol WCU, Taejon 305701, South Korea; [Ryoo, Ryong] Korea Adv Inst Sci & Technol, Inst NanoCentury, Taejon 305701, South Korea; [Terasaki, Osamu] Korea Adv Inst Sci & Technol, Grad Sch EEWS WCU, Taejon 305701, South Korea; [Sakamoto, Yasuhiro] Stockholm Univ, Arrhenius Lab, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden; [Sakamoto, Yasuhiro; Terasaki, Osamu] Osaka Prefecture Univ, Nanosci & Nanotechnol Res Ctr, Sakai, Osaka 5998570, Japan","Ryoo, R (reprint author), Korea Adv Inst Sci & Technol, Dept Chem, Ctr Funct Nanomat, Taejon 305701, South Korea.",rryoo@kaist.ac.kr,"Na, Kyungsu/C-6210-2009; Terasaki, Osamu/A-4912-2010; Choi, Minkee/C-1839-2011; Ryoo, Ryong /B-1090-2009; Sakamoto, Yasuhiro/G-8289-2012","Ryoo, Ryong/0000-0003-0047-3329","National Honor Scientist Program of the Ministry of Education, Science and Technology in Korea; Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation; Swedish Research Council (VR); Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST)","This work was mainly supported by the National Honor Scientist Program of the Ministry of Education, Science and Technology in Korea.

The first rise in atmospheric oxygen is thought to have occurred between similar to 2.45 and 2.2 Gyr ago(1,5), leading to a significant increase in atmospheric oxygen concentrations and concomitant oxygenation of the shallow surface ocean. The second increase in atmospheric oxygen appears to have taken place in distinct stages during the late Neoproterozoic era (similar to 800-542 Myr ago)(3,4), ultimately leading to oxygenation of the deep ocean similar to 580 Myr ago(3), but details of the evolution of atmospheric oxygenation remain uncertain. Here we use chromium (Cr) stable isotopes from banded iron formations (BIFs) to track the presence of Cr(VI) in Precambrian oceans, providing a time-resolved picture of the oxygenation history of the Earth's atmosphere-hydrosphere system. The geochemical behaviour of Cr is highly sensitive to the redox state of the surface environment because oxidative weathering processes produce the oxidized hexavalent [Cr(VI)] form. Oxidation of reduced trivalent [Cr(III)] chromium on land is accompanied by an isotopic fractionation, leading to enrichment of the mobile hexavalent form in the heavier isotope. Our fractionated Cr isotope data indicate the accumulation of Cr(VI) in ocean surface waters similar to 2.8 to 2.6 Gyr ago and a likely transient elevation in atmospheric and surface ocean oxygenation before the first great rise of oxygen 2.45-2.2 Gyr ago ( the Great Oxidation Event)(1,5). In similar to 1.88-Gyr-old BIFs we find that Cr isotopes are not fractionated, indicating a decline in atmospheric oxygen. Our findings suggest that the Great Oxidation Event did not lead to a unidirectional stepwise increase in atmospheric oxygen. In the late Neoproterozoic, we observe strong positive fractionations in Cr isotopes (delta(53) Cr up to +4.9 parts per thousand), providing independent support for increased surface oxygenation at that time, which may have stimulated rapid evolution of macroscopic multicellular life(3,4,6).","[Frei, Robert; Gaucher, Claudio] Univ Copenhagen, Inst Geog & Geol, DK-1350 Copenhagen, Denmark; [Frei, Robert; Gaucher, Claudio] Univ Copenhagen, Nord Ctr Earth Evolut, DK-1350 Copenhagen, Denmark; [Gaucher, Claudio] Fac Ciencias, Dept Geol, Montevideo 11400, Uruguay; [Poulton, Simon W.] Univ Newcastle, Sch Civil Engn & Geosci, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 7RU, Tyne & Wear, England; [Canfield, Don E.] Univ So Denmark, Inst Biol, DK-5230 Odense, Denmark; [Canfield, Don E.] Nord Ctr Earth Evolut, DK-5230 Odense, Denmark","Frei, R (reprint author), Univ Copenhagen, Inst Geog & Geol, Oster Voldgade 10, DK-1350 Copenhagen, Denmark.",robertf@geo.ku.dk,"Canfield, Don/C-1735-2012","Canfield, Don/0000-0001-7602-8366; Poulton, Simon/0000-0001-7621-189X","Danish Agency for Science, Technology and Innovation; Danish National Research Foundation","This study was funded by the Danish Agency for Science, Technology and Innovation and by the Danish National Research Foundation (Danmarks Grundforskningsfond).

Ecologists have long questioned how this diversity is maintained(1-3). Classic theory shows that stable coexistence requires competitors to differ in their niches(4-6); this has motivated numerous investigations of ecological differences presumed to maintain diversity(3,6-8). That niche differences are key to coexistence, however, has recently been challenged by the neutral theory of biodiversity, which explains coexistence with the equivalence of competitors(9). The ensuing controversy has motivated calls for a better understanding of the collective importance of niche differences for the diversity observed in ecological communities(10,11). Here we integrate theory and experimentation to show that niche differences collectively stabilize the dynamics of experimental communities of serpentine annual plants. We used field-parameterized population models to develop a null expectation for community dynamics without the stabilizing effects of niche differences. The population growth rates predicted by this null model varied by several orders of magnitude between species, which is sufficient for rapid competitive exclusion. Moreover, after two generations of community change in the field, Shannon diversity was over 50 per cent greater in communities stabilized by niche differences relative to those exhibiting dynamics predicted by the null model. Finally, in an experiment manipulating species' relative abundances, population growth rates increased when species became rare-the demographic signature of niche differences. Our work thus provides strong evidence that species differences have a critical role in stabilizing species diversity.","[Levine, Jonathan M.] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Ecol Evolut & Marine Biol, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; [HilleRisLambers, Janneke] Univ Washington, Dept Biol, Seattle, WA 98195 USA","Levine, JM (reprint author), Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Ecol Evolut & Marine Biol, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA.",levine@lifesci.ucsb.edu; jhrl@u.washington.edu,"Levine, Jonathan/A-7167-2014","Levine, Jonathan/0000-0003-2857-7904","US National Science Foundation [0743365, 0743183]; David and Lucile Packard Foundation","This work was supported by US National Science Foundation grants 0743365 and 0743183, and a fellowship from the David and Lucile Packard Foundation.

Recently, core photosystem II (PSII) genes were identified in cyanophages and proposed to function in photosynthesis and in increasing viral fitness by supplementing the host production of these proteins(4-7). Here we show evidence for the presence of photosystem I (PSI) genes in the genomes of viruses that infect these marine cyanobacteria, using pre-existing meta-genomic data from the global ocean sampling expedition(8) as well as from viral biomes(9). The seven cyanobacterial core PSI genes identified in this study, psaA, B, C, D, E, K and a unique J and F fusion, form a cluster in cyanophage genomes, suggestive of selection for a distinct function in the virus life cycle. The existence of this PSI cluster was confirmed with overlapping and long polymerase chain reaction on environmental DNA from the Northern Line Islands. Potentially, the seven proteins encoded by the viral genes are sufficient to form an intact monomeric PSI complex.

Progress in a variety of fields has led to a quantitative understanding of the mechanisms that evaluate evidence and reach a decision(1-3). Several formalisms propose that a representation of noisy evidence is evaluated against a criterion to produce a decision(4-8). Without additional evidence, however, these formalisms fail to explain why a decision-maker would change their mind. Here we extend a model, developed to account for both the timing and the accuracy of the initial decision(9), to explain subsequent changes of mind. Subjects made decisions about a noisy visual stimulus, which they indicated by moving a handle. Although they received no additional information after initiating their movement, their hand trajectories betrayed a change of mind in some trials. We propose that noisy evidence is accumulated over time until it reaches a criterion level, or bound, which determines the initial decision, and that the brain exploits information that is in the processing pipeline when the initial decision is made to subsequently either reverse or reaffirm the initial decision. The model explains both the frequency of changes of mind as well as their dependence on both task difficulty and whether the initial decision was accurate or erroneous. The theoretical and experimental findings advance the understanding of decision-making to the highly flexible and cognitive acts of vacillation and self-correction.","[Kiani, Roozbeh; Shadlen, Michael N.] Univ Washington, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Natl Primate Res Ctr, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Kiani, Roozbeh; Shadlen, Michael N.] Univ Washington, Dept Physiol & Biophys, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Resulaj, Arbora; Wolpert, Daniel M.] Univ Cambridge, Dept Engn, Computat & Biol Learning Lab, Cambridge CB2 1PZ, England; [Resulaj, Arbora] Howard Hughes Med Inst, Ashburn, VA 20147 USA","Shadlen, MN (reprint author), Univ Washington, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Natl Primate Res Ctr, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.",shadlen@uw.edu,,"Shadlen, Michael/0000-0002-2002-2210","Wellcome Trust; European grant SENSOPAC [IST-2005-028056]; Howard Hughes Medical Institute; US National Eye Institute [EY11378]; Trinity College, Cambridge","This work was supported by the Wellcome Trust, the European grant SENSOPAC IST-2005-028056, Howard Hughes Medical Institute and US National Eye Institute grant EY11378.

In the chicken and all other birds, the homogametic sex is male (ZZ) and the heterogametic sex is female (ZW). Two hypotheses have been proposed for the mechanism of avian sex determination. The W ( female) chromosome may carry a dominant-acting ovary determinant(4-6). Alternatively, the dosage of a Z-linked gene may mediate sex determination, two doses being required for male development (ZZ)(7,8). A strong candidate avian sex-determinant under the dosage hypothesis is the conserved Z-linked gene, DMRT1 (doublesex and mab-3-related transcription factor 1)(9-11). Here we used RNA interference (RNAi) to knock down DMRT1 in early chicken embryos. Reduction of DMRT1 protein expression in ovo leads to feminization of the embryonic gonads in genetically male (ZZ) embryos. Affected males show partial sex reversal, characterized by feminization of the gonads. The feminized left gonad shows female-like histology, disorganized testis cords and a decline in the testicular marker, SOX9. The ovarian marker, aromatase, is ectopically activated. The feminized right gonad shows a more variable loss of DMRT1 and ectopic aromatase activation, suggesting differential sensitivity to DMRT1 between left and right gonads. Germ cells also show a female pattern of distribution in the feminized male gonads. These results indicate that DMRT1 is required for testis determination in the chicken. Our data support the Z dosage hypothesis for avian sex determination.","[Smith, Craig A.; Roeszler, Kelly N.; Ohnesorg, Thomas; Farlie, Peter G.; Sinclair, Andrew H.] Univ Melbourne, Royal Childrens Hosp, Murdoch Childrens Res Inst, Melbourne, Vic 3052, Australia; [Smith, Craig A.; Roeszler, Kelly N.; Ohnesorg, Thomas; Farlie, Peter G.; Sinclair, Andrew H.] Univ Melbourne, Royal Childrens Hosp, Dept Paediat, Melbourne, Vic 3052, Australia; [Cummins, David M.; Doran, Timothy J.] CSIRO Livestock Ind, Australian Anim Hlth Lab, Geelong, Vic 3220, Australia","Smith, CA (reprint author), Univ Melbourne, Royal Childrens Hosp, Murdoch Childrens Res Inst, Melbourne, Vic 3052, Australia.",craig.smith@mcri.edu.au,"Sinclair, Andrew/A-3598-2010; Doran, Timothy/B-3824-2011","Sinclair, Andrew/0000-0003-2741-7992; Ohnesorg, Thomas/0000-0001-9225-8911",Australian Research Council (ARC) DP; NH MRC Program,"We thank C.

Although DNA sequencing costs have fallen markedly(3), they remain far from what is necessary for rare and novel variants to be routinely identified at a genome-wide scale in large cohorts. We have therefore sought to develop second-generation methods for targeted sequencing of all protein-coding regions ('exomes'), to reduce costs while enriching for discovery of highly penetrant variants. Here we report on the targeted capture and massively parallel sequencing of the exomes of 12 humans. These include eight HapMap individuals representing three populations(4), and four unrelated individuals with a rare dominantly inherited disorder, Freeman-Sheldon syndrome (FSS)(5). We demonstrate the sensitive and specific identification of rare and common variants in over 300 megabases of coding sequence. Using FSS as a proof-of-concept, we show that candidate genes for Mendelian disorders can be identified by exome sequencing of a small number of unrelated, affected individuals. This strategy may be extendable to diseases with more complex genetics through larger sample sizes and appropriate weighting of non-synonymous variants by predicted functional impact.","[Ng, Sarah B.; Turner, Emily H.; Robertson, Peggy D.; Flygare, Steven D.; Lee, Choli; Shaffer, Tristan; Wong, Michelle; Eichler, Evan E.; Nickerson, Deborah A.; Shendure, Jay] Univ Washington, Dept Genome Sci, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Bigham, Abigail W.; Bamshad, Michael] Univ Washington, Dept Pediat, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Eichler, Evan E.] Univ Washington, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Bhattacharjee, Arindam] Agilent Technol, Santa Clara, CA 95051 USA","Shendure, J (reprint author), Univ Washington, Dept Genome Sci, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.",sarahng@u.washington.edu; shendure@u.washington.edu,"Sincan, Murat /A-3794-2010","Turner, Emily/0000-0001-9040-9229; Shendure, Jay/0000-0002-1516-1865","National Institutes of Health/National Heart Lung and Blood Institute; National Institutes of Health/National Human Genome Research Institute; National Institutes of Health/National Institute of Child Health and Human Development; Washington Research Foundation; Agency for Science, Technology and Research, Singapore; Howard Hughes Medical Institute","For discussions or assistance with genotyping data, we thank P.

Specialized neurons in the antenna and a dedicated neuronal circuit in the higher olfactory system mediate CO2 detection and avoidance(1,2). However, fruitflies need to overcome this avoidance response in some environments that contain CO2 such as ripening fruits and fermenting yeast, which are essential food sources. Very little is known about the molecular and neuronal basis of this unique, context-dependent modification of innate olfactory avoidance behaviour. Here we identify a new class of odorants present in food that directly inhibit CO2-sensitive neurons in the antenna. Using an in vivo expression system we establish that the odorants act on the Gr21a/Gr63a CO2 receptor(3). The presence of these odorants significantly and specifically reduces CO2-mediated avoidance behaviour, as well as avoidance mediated by 'Drosophila stress odour'. We propose a model in which behavioural avoidance to CO2 is directly influenced by inhibitory interactions of the novel odours with CO2 receptors. Furthermore, we observe differences in the temporal dynamics of inhibition: the effect of one of these odorants lasts several minutes beyond the initial exposure. Notably, animals that have been briefly pre-exposed to this odorant do not respond to the CO2 avoidance cue even after the odorant is no longer present. We also show that related odorants are effective inhibitors of the CO2 response in Culex mosquitoes that transmit West Nile fever and filariasis. Our findings have broader implications in highlighting the important role of inhibitory odorants in olfactory coding, and in their potential to disrupt CO2-mediated host-seeking behaviour in disease-carrying insects like mosquitoes.","[Ray, Anandasankar] Univ Calif Riverside, Dept Entomol, Riverside, CA 92521 USA; [Turner, Stephanie Lynn] Univ Calif Riverside, Cellular Mol & Dev Biol Program, Riverside, CA 92521 USA","Ray, A (reprint author), Univ Calif Riverside, Dept Entomol, Riverside, CA 92521 USA.",anand.ray@ucr.edu,"Chen, Stephanie/G-3888-2010; Marion-Poll, Frederic/D-8882-2011","Marion-Poll, Frederic/0000-0001-6824-0180; Ray, Anandasankar/0000-0003-4133-2581",,,,29,91,95,2,36,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,10-Sep,2009,461,7261,,,,,277,U159,,10.1038/nature08295,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,492KN,WOS:000269654600047,19710651,No,,,11/20/17

This is thought to be due to the release of 'find-me' signals by apoptotic cells that recruit motile phagocytes such as monocytes, macrophages and dendritic cells, leading to the prompt clearance of the dying cells(2). However, the identity and in vivo relevance of such find-me signals are not well understood. Here, through several lines of evidence, we identify extracellular nucleotides as a critical apoptotic cell find-me signal. We demonstrate the caspase-dependent release of ATP and UTP (in equimolar quantities) during the early stages of apoptosis by primary thymocytes and cell lines. Purified nucleotides at these concentrations were sufficient to induce monocyte recruitment comparable to that of apoptotic cell supernatants. Enzymatic removal of ATP and UTP (by apyrase or the expression of ectopic CD39) abrogated the ability of apoptotic cell supernatants to recruit monocytes in vitro and in vivo. We then identified the ATP/UTP receptor P2Y(2) as a critical sensor of nucleotides released by apoptotic cells using RNA interference-mediated depletion studies in monocytes, and macrophages from P2Y(2)-null mice(3). The relevance of nucleotides in apoptotic cell clearance in vivo was revealed by two approaches. First, in a murine air-pouch model, apoptotic cell supernatants induced a threefold greater recruitment of monocytes and macrophages than supernatants from healthy cells did; this recruitment was abolished by depletion of nucleotides and was significantly decreased in P2Y(2)(-/-) ( also known as P2ry(2)(-/-)) mice. Second, clearance of apoptotic thymocytes was significantly impaired by either depletion of nucleotides or interference with P2Y receptor function ( by pharmacological inhibition or in P2Y(2)(-/-) mice). These results identify nucleotides as a critical find-me cue released by apoptotic cells to promote P2Y(2)-dependent recruitment of phagocytes, and provide evidence for a clear relationship between a find-me signal and efficient corpse clearance in vivo.","[Elliott, Michael R.; Chekeni, Faraaz B.; Trampont, Paul C.; Walk, Scott F.; Park, Daeho; Ravichandran, Kodi S.] Univ Virginia, Beirne B Carter Ctr Immunol Res, Charlottesville, VA 22908 USA; [Elliott, Michael R.; Trampont, Paul C.; Walk, Scott F.; Park, Daeho; Ravichandran, Kodi S.] Univ Virginia, Ctr Cell Clearance, Charlottesville, VA 22908 USA; [Chekeni, Faraaz B.; Leitinger, Norbert] Univ Virginia, Dept Pharmacol, Charlottesville, VA 22908 USA; [Kadl, Alexandra; Ostankovich, Marina; Sharma, Poonam; Leitinger, Norbert] Univ Virginia, Robert M Berne Cardiovasc Res Ctr, Charlottesville, VA 22908 USA; [Woodson, Robin I.; Lysiak, Jeffrey J.] Univ Virginia, Dept Urol, Charlottesville, VA 22908 USA; [Ravichandran, Kodi S.] Univ Virginia, Dept Microbiol, Charlottesville, VA 22908 USA; [Lazarowski, Eduardo R.] Univ N Carolina, Sch Med, Dept Med, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA; [Harden, T.

Structural studies(4,5) have suggested that the oncogenic (and ligand-independent) signalling properties of ErbB2 result from the absence of a key intramolecular 'tether' in the extracellular region that autoinhibits other human ErbB receptors, including the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor(6). Although ErbB2 is unique among the four human ErbB receptors(6,7), here we show that it is the closest structural relative of the single EGF receptor family member in Drosophila melanogaster (dEGFR). Genetic and biochemical data show that dEGFR is tightly regulated by growth factor ligands(8), yet a crystal structure shows that it, too, lacks the intramolecular tether seen in human EGFR, ErbB3 and ErbB4. Instead, a distinct set of autoinhibitory interdomain interactions hold unliganded dEGFR in an inactive state. All of these interactions are maintained (and even extended) in ErbB2, arguing against the suggestion that ErbB2 lacks autoinhibition. We therefore suggest that normal and pathogenic ErbB2 signalling may be regulated by ligands in the same way as dEGFR. Our findings have important implications for ErbB2 regulation in human cancer, and for developing therapeutic approaches that target novel aspects of this orphan receptor.","[Alvarado, Diego; Klein, Daryl E.; Lemmon, Mark A.] Univ Penn, Sch Med, Dept Biochem & Biophys, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA","Lemmon, MA (reprint author), Univ Penn, Sch Med, Dept Biochem & Biophys, 809C Stellar Chance Labs,422 Curie Blvd, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",mlemmon@mail.med.upenn.edu,,"Lemmon, Mark/0000-0002-3379-5319",National Cancer Institute; National Institute of General Medical Science; NIH; US Army Breast Cancer Research Program; Damon Runyon Cancer Research Foundation,"We thank members of the Lemmon and Ferguson laboratories, K.

This goal has been achieved with electron crystallography(1) in those special cases where a protein forms highly ordered arrays in lipid bilayers. It has also been achieved by NMR methods(1) in proteins up to 50 kilodaltons (kDa) in size, although milligram quantities of protein and isotopic labelling are required. For structural analysis of large soluble proteins in microgram quantities, an increasingly powerful method that does not require crystallization is single-particle reconstruction from electron microscopy of cryogenically cooled samples (electron cryomicroscopy (cryo-EM))(2). Here we report the first single-particle cryo-EM study of a membrane protein, the human large-conductance calcium-and voltage-activated potassium channel(3) (BK), in a lipid environment. The new method is called random spherically constrained (RSC) single-particle reconstruction. BK channels, members of the six-transmembrane segment (6TM) ion channel family, were reconstituted at low density into lipid vesicles (liposomes), and their function was verified by a potassium flux assay. Vesicles were also frozen in vitreous ice and imaged in an electron microscope. From images of 8,400 individual protein particles, a three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction of the BK channel and its membrane environment was obtained at a resolution of 1.7-2.0 nm. Not requiring the formation of crystals, the RSC approach promises to be useful in the structural study of many other membrane proteins as well.","[Wang, Liguo; Sigworth, Fred J.] Yale Univ, Dept Cellular & Mol Physiol, New Haven, CT 06520 USA","Sigworth, FJ (reprint author), Yale Univ, Dept Cellular & Mol Physiol, 333 Cedar St, New Haven, CT 06520 USA.",fred.sigworth@yale.edu,,,"NCRR NIH HHS [S10 RR014739-01, S10 RR014739, S10 RR014739-018020]; NIGMS NIH HHS [P01 GM062580, P01 GM062580-06A10007, P01 GM062580-070007, P01 GM062580-080007]; NINDS NIH HHS [R01 NS021501, R01 NS021501-19, R01 NS021501-19S1, R01 NS021501-20, R01 NS021501-21, R01 NS021501-22, R01 NS021501-23, R01 NS021501-24]",,,30,106,110,1,33,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,10-Sep,2009,461,7261,,,,,292,U177,,10.1038/nature08291,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,492KN,WOS:000269654600050,19718020,No,,,11/20/17

This is mediated by a dedicated nucleo-cytoplasmic transport factor of the karyopherin-beta family (Xpot, also known as Los1 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae). Here we report the 3.2 angstrom resolution structure of Schizosaccharomyces pombe Xpot in complex with tRNA and RanGTP, and the 3.1 angstrom structure of unbound Xpot, revealing both nuclear and cytosolic snapshots of this transport factor. Xpot undergoes a large conformational change on binding cargo, wrapping around the tRNA and, in particular, binding to the tRNA 59 and 39 ends. The binding mode explains how Xpot can recognize all mature tRNAs in the cell and yet distinguish them from those that have not been properly processed, thus coupling tRNA export to quality control.","[Cook, Atlanta G.; Conti, Elena] MPI Biochem, D-82152 Martinsried, Germany; [Fukuhara, Noemi; Jinek, Martin; Conti, Elena] EMBL, D-69117 Heidelberg, Germany","Conti, E (reprint author), MPI Biochem, Am Klopferspitz 18, D-82152 Martinsried, Germany.",conti@biochem.mpg.de,"Cook, Atlanta/A-8641-2015","Cook, Atlanta/0000-0003-2087-9772; Jinek, Martin/0000-0002-7601-210X",Max Planck Gesellschaft; European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL); Sonderforschungsbereich SFB646; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG); EU [LSHG-CT-2005-512028],"We would like to thank P.

The tidal disruption of these systems is expected to result in loosely bound stars surrounding the galaxy, at distances that reach 10-100 times the radius of the central disk(2,3). The number, luminosity and morphology of the relics of this process provide significant clues to galaxy formation history(4), but obtaining a comprehensive survey of these components is difficult because of their intrinsic faintness and vast extent. Here we report a panoramic survey of the Andromeda galaxy (M31). We detect stars and coherent structures that are almost certainly remnants of dwarf galaxies destroyed by the tidal field of M31. An improved census of their surviving counterparts implies that three-quarters of M31's satellites brighter than M(v) =-6 await discovery. The brightest companion, Triangulum (M33), is surrounded by a stellar structure that provides persuasive evidence for a recent encounter with M31. This panorama of galaxy structure directly confirms the basic tenets of the hierarchical galaxy formation model and reveals the shared history of M31 and M33 in the unceasing build-up of galaxies.","[McConnachie, Alan W.; Cote, Patrick; Puzia, Thomas H.] NRC Herzberg Inst Astrophys, Victoria, BC V9E 2E7, Canada; [Irwin, Michael J.; Chapman, Scott C.; Collins, Michelle L.

Doppler cooling of dilute atomic gases is an extremely successful application of this concept(2,3). More recently, anti-Stokes cooling in multilevel systems has been explored(4,5), culminating in the optical refrigeration of solids(6-9). Collisional redistribution of radiation has been proposed(10) as a different cooling mechanism for atomic two-level systems, although experimental investigations using moderate-density gases have not reached the cooling regime(11). Here we experimentally demonstrate laser cooling of an atomic gas based on collisional redistribution of radiation, using rubidium atoms in argon buffer gas at a pressure of 230 bar. The frequent collisions in the ultradense gas transiently shift a highly red-detuned laser beam(that is, one detuned to a much lower frequency) into resonance, whereas spontaneous decay occurs close to the unperturbed atomic resonance frequency. During each excitation cycle, kinetic energy of order k(B)T-that is, the thermal energy (k(B), Boltzmann's constant; T, temperature)-is extracted from the dense atomic sample. In a proof-of-principle experiment with a thermally non-isolated sample, we demonstrate relative cooling by 66 K. The cooled gas has a density more than ten orders of magnitude greater than the typical values used in Doppler-cooling experiments, and the cooling power reaches 87 mW. Future applications of the technique may include supercooling beyond the homogeneous nucleation temperature(12,13) and optical chillers(9).","[Vogl, Ulrich; Weitz, Martin] Univ Bonn, Inst Angew Phys, D-53115 Bonn, Germany","Weitz, M (reprint author), Univ Bonn, Inst Angew Phys, Wegelerstr 8, D-53115 Bonn, Germany.",martin.weitz@uni-bonn.de,"Vogl, Ulrich/G-4624-2014","Vogl, Ulrich/0000-0003-2399-2797",Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft [FOR557],We thank J.

Understanding the relationship between the two scales requires a bridge from the molecular world to the macroscopic world. Connecting these two domains with atomic precision is a central goal of the natural sciences, but it requires high spatial control of the 3D structure of matter(1). The simplest practical route to producing precisely designed 3D macroscopic objects is to form a crystalline arrangement by self-assembly, because such a periodic array has only conceptually simple requirements: a motif that has a robust 3D structure, dominant affinity interactions between parts of the motif when it self-associates, and predictable structures for these affinity interactions. Fulfilling these three criteria to produce a 3D periodic system is not easy, but should readily be achieved with well-structured branched DNA motifs tailed by sticky ends(2). Complementary sticky ends associate with each other preferentially and assume the well-known B-DNA structure when they do so(3); the helically repeating nature of DNA facilitates the construction of a periodic array. It is essential that the directions of propagation associated with the sticky ends do not share the same plane, but extend to form a 3D arrangement of matter. Here we report the crystal structure at 4 angstrom resolution of a designed, self-assembled, 3D crystal based on the DNA tensegrity triangle(4). The data demonstrate clearly that it is possible to design and self-assemble a well-ordered macromolecular 3D crystalline lattice with precise control.","[Zheng, Jianping; Birktoft, Jens J.; Wang, Tong; Sha, Ruojie; Constantinou, Pamela E.; Seeman, Nadrian C.] NYU, Dept Chem, New York, NY 10003 USA; [Chen, Yi; Mao, Chengde] Purdue Univ, Dept Chem, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA; [Ginell, Stephan L.] Argonne Natl Lab, Struct Biol Ctr, Argonne, IL 60439 USA","Seeman, NC (reprint author), NYU, Dept Chem, New York, NY 10003 USA.",mao@purdue.edu; ned.seeman@nyu.edu,"Chen, Yi/D-7943-2013",,National Institute of General Medical Sciences; National Science Foundation [CCF-0622093]; Army Research Office; Office of Naval Research; W.

The main loss term from the fixed nitrogen inventory is the production of dinitrogen gas (N(2)) by heterotrophic denitrification or the more recently discovered autotrophic process, anaerobic ammonia oxidation (anammox). Oceanic oxygen minimum zones (OMZ) are responsible for about 35% of oceanic N(2) production and up to half of that occurs in the Arabian Sea(1). Although denitrification was long thought to be the only loss term, it has recently been argued that anammox alone is responsible for fixed nitrogen loss in the OMZs(2-4). Here we measure denitrification and anammox rates and quantify the abundance of denitrifying and anammox bacteria in the OMZ regions of the Eastern Tropical South Pacific and the Arabian Sea. We find that denitrification rather than anammox dominates the N(2) loss term in the Arabian Sea, the largest and most intense OMZ in the world ocean. In seven of eight experiments in the Arabian Sea denitrification is responsible for 87-99% of the total N(2) production. The dominance of denitrification is reproducible using two independent isotope incubation methods. In contrast, anammox is dominant in the Eastern Tropical South Pacific OMZ, as detected using one of the isotope incubation methods, as previously reported(3,5). The abundance of denitrifying bacteria always exceeded that of anammox bacteria by up to 7- and 19-fold in the Eastern Tropical South Pacific and Arabian Sea, respectively. Geographic and temporal variability in carbon supply may be responsible for the different contributions of denitrification and anammox in these two OMZs. The large contribution of denitrification to N(2) loss in the Arabian Sea indicates the global significance of denitrification to the oceanic nitrogen budget.","[Ward, B. B.; Bulow, S.

Here we report dates for two western Mediterranean hand-axe sites that are nearly twice the age of the supposed earliest Acheulian in western Europe. Palaeomagnetic analysis of these two sites in southeastern Spain found reverse polarity magnetozones, showing that hand-axes were already in Europe as early as 0.9 Myr ago.

It has become a popular means to reprogram somatic genomes into an embryonic-like pluripotent state, and a preferred alternative to somatic-cell nuclear transfer and somatic-cell fusion with ES cells(7,8). However, iPS cell reprogramming remains slow and inefficient. Notably, no live animals have been produced by the most stringent tetraploid complementation assay, indicative of a failure to create fully pluripotent cells. Here we report the generation of several iPS cell lines that are capable of generating viable, fertile live-born progeny by tetraploid complementation. These iPS cells maintain a pluripotent potential that is very close to ES cells generated from in vivo or nuclear transfer embryos.

These iPS cells hold great promise for medicine because they have the potential to generate patient-specific cell types for cell replacement therapy and produce in vitro models of disease, without requiring embryonic tissues or oocytes(8-10). Although current iPS cell lines resemble ES cells, they have not passed the most stringent test of pluripotency by generating full-term or adult mice in tetraploid complementation assays(3,11), raising questions as to whether they are sufficiently potent to generate all of the cell types in an organism. Whether this difference between iPS and ES cells reflects intrinsic limitations of direct reprogramming is not known. Here we report fertile adult mice derived entirely from iPS cells that we generated by inducible genetic reprogramming of mouse embryonic fibroblasts. Producing adult mice derived entirely from a reprogrammed fibroblast shows that all features of a differentiated cell can be restored to an embryonic level of pluripotency without exposure to unknown ooplasmic factors. Comparing these fully pluripotent iPS cell lines to less developmentally potent lines may reveal molecular markers of different pluripotent states. Furthermore, mice derived entirely from iPS cells will provide a new resource to assess the functional and genomic stability of cells and tissues derived from iPS cells, which is important to validate their utility in cell replacement therapy and research applications.","[Boland, Michael J.; Hazen, Jennifer L.; Nazor, Kristopher L.; Baldwin, Kristin K.] Scripps Res Inst, Dept Cell Biol, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; [Rodriguez, Alberto R.; Martin, Greg; Kupriyanov, Sergey] Scripps Res Inst, Mouse Genet Core Facil, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; [Gifford, Wesley] Univ Calif San Diego, Med Scientist Training Program, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA","Baldwin, KK (reprint author), Scripps Res Inst, Dept Cell Biol, 10550 N Torrey Pines Rd, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA.",kitnazor@scripps.edu; kbaldwin@scripps.edu,,,Pew Scholars Award; California Institute of Regenerative Medicine; Whitehall Foundation; O'Keefe Foundation; Shapiro Family Foundation,"We wish to thank S.

This has evolved in birds, mammals and crocodilians into complete septation of the heart into left and right sides, allowing separate pulmonary and systemic circulatory systems, a key requirement for the evolution of endothermy(1-3). However, the evolution of the amniote heart is poorly understood. Reptilian hearts have been the subject of debate in the context of the evolution of cardiac septation: do they possess a single ventricular chamber or two incompletely septated ventricles(4-7)? Here we examine heart development in the red-eared slider turtle, Trachemys scripta elegans (a chelonian), and the green anole, Anolis carolinensis (a squamate), focusing on gene expression in the developing ventricles. Both reptiles initially form a ventricular chamber that homogenously expresses the T-box transcription factor gene Tbx5. In contrast, in birds and mammals, Tbx5 is restricted to left ventricle precursors(8,9). In later stages, Tbx5 expression in the turtle (but not anole) heart is gradually restricted to a distinct left ventricle, forming a left-right gradient. This suggests that Tbx5 expression was refined during evolution to pattern the ventricles. In support of this hypothesis, we show that loss of Tbx5 in the mouse ventricle results in a single chamber lacking distinct identity, indicating a requirement for Tbx5 in septation. Importantly, misexpression of Tbx5 throughout the developing myocardium to mimic the reptilian expression pattern also results in a single mispatterned ventricular chamber lacking septation. Thus ventricular septation is established by a steep and correctly positioned Tbx5 gradient. Our findings provide a molecular mechanism for the evolution of the amniote ventricle, and support the concept that altered expression of developmental regulators is a key mechanism of vertebrate evolution.","[Koshiba-Takeuchi, Kazuko; Mori, Alessandro D.; Kaynak, Bogac L.; Sukonnik, Tatyana; Bruneau, Benoit G.] Gladstone Inst Cardiovasc Dis, San Francisco, CA 94158 USA; [Koshiba-Takeuchi, Kazuko; Mori, Alessandro D.; Kaynak, Bogac L.; Sukonnik, Tatyana; Black, Brian L.; Bruneau, Benoit G.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Cardiovasc Res Inst, San Francisco, CA 94158 USA; [Koshiba-Takeuchi, Kazuko; Mori, Alessandro D.; Kaynak, Bogac L.; Sukonnik, Tatyana; Bruneau, Benoit G.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Pediat, San Francisco, CA 94158 USA; [Koshiba-Takeuchi, Kazuko; Takeuchi, Jun K.] Tokyo Inst Technol, Div Cardiovasc Res, Global Edge Inst, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2268503, Japan; [Mori, Alessandro D.; Bruneau, Benoit G.] Hosp Sick Children, Program Stem Cell & Dev Biol, Toronto, ON M5G 1X8, Canada; [Mori, Alessandro D.; Bruneau, Benoit G.] Univ Toronto, Dept Mol Genet, Toronto, ON M5S 1A8, Canada; [Cebra-Thomas, Judith] Millersville Univ Pennsylvania, Dept Biol, Millersville, PA 17551 USA; [Georges, Romain O.; Nemer, Mona] Univ Montreal, Programme Biol Mol, Inst Rech Clin Montreal, Montreal, PQ H3C 3J7, Canada; [Latham, Stephany; Beck, Laural; Wade, Juli] Michigan State Univ, Dept Psychol, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Latham, Stephany; Beck, Laural; Wade, Juli] Michigan State Univ, Program Neurosci, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Henkelman, R.

Recent biosensor studies have shown that all three GTPases are activated at the front of migrating cells(4-7), and biochemical evidence suggests that they may regulate one another: Cdc42 can activate Rac1 (ref. 8), and Rac1 and RhoA are mutually inhibitory(9-12). However, their spatiotemporal coordination, at the seconds and single-micrometre dimensions typical of individual protrusion events, remains unknown. Here we examine GTPase coordination in mouse embryonic fibroblasts both through simultaneous visualization of two GTPase biosensors and using a 'computational multiplexing' approach capable of defining the relationships between multiple protein activities visualized in separate experiments. We found that RhoA is activated at the cell edge synchronous with edge advancement, whereas Cdc42 and Rac1 are activated 2 mm behind the edge with a delay of 40s. This indicates that Rac1 and RhoA operate antagonistically through spatial separation and precise timing, and that RhoA has a role in the initial events of protrusion, whereas Rac1 and Cdc42 activate pathways implicated in reinforcement and stabilization of newly expanded protrusions.","[Hodgson, Louis; Welch, Christopher; Abell, Amy; Johnson, Gary L.; Hahn, Klaus M.] Univ N Carolina, Dept Pharmacol, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA; [Hodgson, Louis; Welch, Christopher; Abell, Amy; Johnson, Gary L.; Hahn, Klaus M.] Univ N Carolina, Lineberger Canc Ctr, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA; [Hodgson, Louis; Welch, Christopher; Abell, Amy; Johnson, Gary L.; Hahn, Klaus M.] Univ N Carolina, Dept Med Chem, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA; [Machacek, Matthias; Elliott, Hunter; Pertz, Olivier; Danuser, Gaudenz] Scripps Res Inst, Dept Cell Biol, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; [Nalbant, Perihan] Univ Duisburg Essen, Ctr Med Biotechnol, Dept Mol Cell Biol, D-45117 Essen, Germany","Hahn, KM (reprint author), Univ N Carolina, Dept Pharmacol, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA.",khahn@med.unc.edu; gdanuser@scripps.edu,,"Hodgson, Louis/0000-0001-9188-7580",Swiss National Science Foundation; Novartis Foundation; Ciba-Geigy Jubilee Foundation; NIGMS [U54 GM064346];  [NIH T32 GM008719];  [NIH F30 HL094020];  [NIH R01 GM57464];  [NIH R01 GM71868],"We acknowledge funding from the Swiss National Science Foundation and the Novartis Foundation, formerly the Ciba-Geigy Jubilee Foundation (M.

Protein activity has been controlled by light, through protein derivatization with photocleavable moieties(1) or using photoreactive small-molecule ligands(2). However, this requires use of toxic ultraviolet wavelengths, activation is irreversible, and/or cell loading is accomplished via disruption of the cell membrane (for example, through microinjection). Here we have developed a new approach to produce genetically encoded photoactivatable derivatives of Rac1, a key GTPase regulating actin cytoskeletal dynamics in metazoan cells(3,4.) Rac1 mutants were fused to the photoreactive LOV (light oxygen voltage) domain from phototropin(5,6), sterically blocking Rac1 interactions until irradiation unwound a helix linking LOV to Rac1. Photoactivatable Rac1 (PA-Rac1) could be reversibly and repeatedly activated using 458-or 473-nm light to generate precisely localized cell protrusions and ruffling. Localized Rac activation or inactivation was sufficient to produce cell motility and control the direction of cell movement. Myosin was involved in Rac control of directionality but not in Rac-induced protrusion, whereas PAK was required for Rac-induced protrusion. PA-Rac1 was used to elucidate Rac regulation of RhoA in cell motility. Rac and Rho coordinate cytoskeletal behaviours with seconds and submicrometre precision(7,8). Their mutual regulation remains controversial(9), with data indicating that Rac inhibits and/or activates Rho(10,11). Rac was shown to inhibit RhoA in mouse embryonic fibroblasts, with inhibition modulated at protrusions and ruffles. A PA-Rac crystal structure and modelling revealed LOV-Rac interactions that will facilitate extension of this photoactivation approach to other proteins.","[Wu, Yi I.; Lungu, Oana I.; Jaehrig, Angelika; Hahn, Klaus M.] Univ N Carolina, Dept Pharmacol, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA; [Lungu, Oana I.; Kuhlman, Brian] Univ N Carolina, Dept Biochem & Biophys, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA; [Wu, Yi I.; Lungu, Oana I.; Jaehrig, Angelika; Kuhlman, Brian; Hahn, Klaus M.] Univ N Carolina, Lineberger Comprehens Canc Ctr, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA; [Frey, Daniel; Schlichting, Ilme] Max Planck Inst Med Res, Dept Biomol Mech, D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany","Hahn, KM (reprint author), Univ N Carolina, Dept Pharmacol, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA.",yiwu@med.unc.edu; khahn@med.unc.edu,"Schlichting, Ilme/I-1339-2013",,"American Heart Association; National Institutes of Health [GM057464, GM64346]","We are grateful for help and constructs from W.

Although apoptosis is the most rapid mechanism for eliminating cells lacking appropriate ECM attachment(2), recent reports suggest that non-apoptotic death processes prevent survival when apoptosis is inhibited in matrix-deprived cells(3,4). Here we demonstrate that detachment of mammary epithelial cells from ECM causes an ATP deficiency owing to the loss of glucose transport. Overexpression of ERBB2 rescues the ATP deficiency by restoring glucose uptake through stabilization of EGFR and phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase (PI(3) K) activation, and this rescue is dependent on glucose-stimulated flux through the antioxidant-generating pentose phosphate pathway. Notably, we found that the ATP deficiency could be rescued by antioxidant treatment without rescue of glucose uptake. This rescue was found to be dependent on stimulation of fatty acid oxidation, which is inhibited by detachment-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS). The significance of these findings was supported by evidence of an increase in ROS in matrix-deprived cells in the luminal space of mammary acini, and the discovery that antioxidants facilitate the survival of these cells and enhance anchorage-independent colony formation. These results show both the importance of matrix attachment in regulating metabolic activity and an unanticipated mechanism for cell survival in altered matrix environments by antioxidant restoration of ATP generation.","[Schafer, Zachary T.; Grassian, Alexandra R.; Song, Loling; Jiang, Zhenyang; Irie, Hanna Y.; Gao, Sizhen; Puigserver, Pere; Brugge, Joan S.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Cell Biol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Gerhart-Hines, Zachary; Puigserver, Pere] Dana Farber Canc Inst, Dept Canc Biol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Gerhart-Hines, Zachary] Johns Hopkins Univ, Sch Med, Dept Cell Biol, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA","Brugge, JS (reprint author), Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Cell Biol, Boston, MA 02115 USA.",joan_brugge@hms.harvard.edu,,,National Cancer Institute; National Institutes of Health (NIH); NCI; National Science Graduate Research Fellowship,"We thank M.

TRAF6 functions together with a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme complex consisting of UBC13 (also known as UBE2N) and UEV1A (UBE2V1) to catalyse Lys 63-linked polyubiquitination, which activates the TAK1 (also known as MAP3K7) kinase complex(4,5). TAK1 in turn phosphorylates and activates I kappa B kinase (IKK), leading to the activation of NF-kappa B. Although several proteins are known to be polyubiquitinated in the IL1R and Toll-like receptor pathways, it is not clear whether ubiquitination of any of these proteins is important for TAK1 or IKK activation. By reconstituting TAK1 activation in vitro using purified proteins, here we show that free Lys 63 polyubiquitin chains, which are not conjugated to any target protein, directly activate TAK1 by binding to the ubiquitin receptor TAB2 (also known as MAP3K7IP2). This binding leads to autophosphorylation and activation of TAK1. Furthermore, we found that unanchored polyubiquitin chains synthesized by TRAF6 and UBCH5C (also known as UBE2D3) activate the IKK complex. Disassembly of the polyubiquitin chains by deubiquitination enzymes prevented TAK1 and IKK activation. These results indicate that unanchored polyubiquitin chains directly activate TAK1 and IKK, suggesting a new mechanism of protein kinase regulation.","[Xia, Zong-Ping; Sun, Lijun; Chen, Xiang; Pineda, Gabriel; Jiang, Xiaomo; Adhikari, Anirban; Zeng, Wenwen; Chen, Zhijian J.] Univ Texas SW Med Ctr Dallas, Dept Mol Biol, Dallas, TX 75390 USA; [Sun, Lijun; Chen, Xiang; Chen, Zhijian J.] Univ Texas SW Med Ctr Dallas, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Dallas, TX 75390 USA","Chen, ZJ (reprint author), Univ Texas SW Med Ctr Dallas, Dept Mol Biol, Dallas, TX 75390 USA.",Zhijian.Chen@UTSouthwestern.edu,"Chen, Zhijian/C-6039-2012; Zeng, Wenwen/D-7276-2017","Zeng, Wenwen/0000-0001-8544-3318","National Institute of Health [RO1-AI09919, RO1-GM63692]; Robert Welch Foundation [I-1389]; Howard Hughes Medical Institute","We thank C.-K.

In bacteria, mechanosensation is mediated by the mechanosensitive channels of large (MscL), small (MscS), potassium-dependent (MscK) and mini (MscM) conductances. These channels act as 'emergency relief valves' protecting bacteria from lysis upon acute osmotic down-shock(3). Among them, MscL has been intensively studied since the original identification and characterization 15 years ago(4). MscL is reversibly and directly gated by changes in membrane tension. In the open state, MscL forms a non-selective 3 nS conductance channel which gates at tensions close to the lytic limit of the bacterial membrane. An earlier crystal structure at 3.5 angstrom resolution of a pentameric MscL from Mycobacterium tuberculosis represents a closed-state or non-conducting conformation(5,6). MscL has a complex gating behaviour; it exhibits several intermediates between the closed and open states, including one putative non-conductive expanded state and at least three sub-conducting states(7). Although our understanding of the closed(5,6) and open(8-10) states of MscL has been increasing, little is known about the structures of the intermediate states despite their importance in elucidating the complete gating process of MscL. Here we present the crystal structure of a carboxy-terminal truncation mutant (Delta 95-120) of MscL from Staphylococcus aureus (SaMscL(C Delta 26)) at 3.8 angstrom resolution. Notably, SaMscL(C Delta 26) forms a tetrameric channel with both transmembrane helices tilted away from the membrane normal at angles close to that inferred for the open state(9), probably corresponding to a non-conductive but partially expanded intermediate state.","[Liu, Zhenfeng; Gandhi, Chris S.; Rees, Douglas C.] CALTECH, Div Chem & Chem Engn, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA; [Liu, Zhenfeng; Rees, Douglas C.] CALTECH, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA","Rees, DC (reprint author), CALTECH, Div Chem & Chem Engn, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA.",dcrees@caltech.edu,,"liu, zhen feng/0000-0001-5502-9474",Howard Hughes Medical Institute; National Institutes of Health [GM084211]; Beckman Foundation,"We thank A.

Cargo attached to the kinesin stalk moves processively in 8-nm increments(3) as its twin motor domains (heads) carry out an asymmetric, 'hand-over-hand' walk(4-7). The extent of individual head interactions with the microtubule during stepping, however, remains controversial(4,8-14). A major experimental limitation has been the lack of a means to monitor the attachment of an individual head to the microtubule during movement, necessitating indirect approaches. Here we report the development of a single-molecule assay that can directly report head binding in a walking kinesin molecule, and show that only a single head is bound to the microtubule between steps at low ATP concentrations. A bead was linked to one of the two kinesin heads by means of a short DNA tether and used to apply rapidly alternating hindering and assisting loads with an optical trap. The time-dependent difference between forwards and backwards displacements of the bead alternated between two discrete values during stepping, corresponding to those intervals when the linked head adopted a bound or an unbound state. The linked head could only rebind the microtubule once ATP had become bound to its partner head.","[Block, Steven M.] Stanford Univ, Dept Biol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Block, Steven M.] Stanford Univ, Dept Appl Phys, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Guydosh, Nicholas R.] Stanford Univ, Biophys Program, Stanford, CA 94305 USA","Block, SM (reprint author), Stanford Univ, Dept Biol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",sblock@stanford.edu,,,US National Institutes of Health [GM51453],"We thank A.

The mammalian beta-globin loci have served as a model for gene regulation during development. Transgenic mice containing the human beta-globin locus, consisting of the linked embryonic (epsilon), fetal (gamma) and adult (beta) genes, have been used as a system to investigate the temporal switch from fetal to adult haemoglobin, as occurs in humans. Here we show that the human gamma-globin (HBG) genes in these mice behave as murine embryonic globin genes, revealing a limitation of the model and demonstrating that critical differences in the trans-acting milieu have arisen during mammalian evolution. We show that the expression of BCL11A, a repressor of human gamma-globin expression identified by genome-wide association studies, differs between mouse and human. Developmental silencing of the mouse embryonic globin and human gamma-globin genes fails to occur in mice in the absence of BCL11A. Thus, BCL11A is a critical mediator of species-divergent globin switching. By comparing the ontogeny of beta-globin gene regulation in mice and humans, we have shown that alterations in the expression of a trans-acting factor constitute a critical driver of gene expression changes during evolution.","[Sankaran, Vijay G.; Xu, Jian; Walkley, Carl R.; Fujiwara, Yuko; Orkin, Stuart H.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Childrens Hosp Boston, Div Hematol Oncol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Sankaran, Vijay G.; Xu, Jian; Walkley, Carl R.; Fujiwara, Yuko; Orkin, Stuart H.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Pediat Oncol, Dana Farber Canc Inst,Harvard Stem Cell Inst, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Xu, Jian; Fujiwara, Yuko; Orkin, Stuart H.] Howard Hughes Med Inst, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Ragoczy, Tobias; Groudine, Mark; Bender, M.

The hot Jupiters closest to their parent stars, at orbital distances of only similar to 0.02 astronomical units, have strong tidal interactions(4,5), and systems such as OGLE-TR-56 have been suggested as tests of tidal dissipation theory(6,7). Here we report the discovery of planet WASP-18b with an orbital period of 0.94 days and a mass of ten Jupiter masses (10 M-Jup), resulting in a tidal interaction an order of magnitude stronger than that of planet OGLE-TR-56b. Under the assumption that the tidal-dissipation parameter Q of the host star is of the order of 10 6, as measured for Solar System bodies and binary stars and as often applied to extrasolar planets, WASP-18b will be spiralling inwards on a timescale less than a thousandth that of the lifetime of its host star. Therefore either WASP-18 is in a rare, exceptionally short-lived state, or the tidal dissipation in this system (and possibly other hot-Jupiter systems) must be much weaker than in the Solar System.","[Hellier, Coel; Anderson, D.

Prominent examples include the anomalous quantization of magneto-electric coupling(4-6), half-fermion states that are their own antiparticle(7,8), and charge fractionalization in a Bose-Einstein condensate(9), all of which are not possible with conventional Dirac fermions of the graphene variety(10). Helical Dirac fermions have so far remained elusive owing to the lack of necessary spin-sensitive measurements and because such fermions are forbidden to exist in conventional materials harbouring relativistic electrons, such as graphene(10) or bismuth(11). It has recently been proposed that helical Dirac fermions may exist at the edges of certain types of topologically ordered insulators(3,4,12)-materials with a bulk insulating gap of spin-orbit origin and surface states protected against scattering by time-reversal symmetry-and that their peculiar properties may be accessed provided the insulator is tuned into the so-called topological transport regime(3-9). However, helical Dirac fermions have not been observed in existing topological insulators(13-18). Here we report the realization and characterization of a tunable topological insulator in a bismuth-based class of material by combining spin-imaging and momentum-resolved spectroscopies, bulk charge compensation, Hall transport measurements and surface quantum control. Our results reveal a spin-momentum locked Dirac cone carrying a non-trivial Berry's phase that is nearly 100 per cent spin-polarized, which exhibits a tunable topological fermion density in the vicinity of the Kramers point and can be driven to the long-sought topological spin transport regime. The observed topological nodal state is shown to be protected even up to 300 K. Our demonstration of room-temperature topological order and non-trivial spin-texture in stoichiometric Bi(2)Se(3).M(x) (M(x) indicates surface doping or gating control) paves the way for future graphene-like studies of topological insulators, and applications of the observed spin-polarized edge channels in spintronic and computing technologies possibly at room temperature.","[Hsieh, D.; Xia, Y.; Qian, D.; Wray, L.; Checkelsky, J.

These materials are distinguished from ordinary insulators by the presence of gapless metallic surface states, resembling chiral edge modes in quantum Hall systems, but with unconventional spin textures. A key predicted feature of such spin-textured boundary states is their insensitivity to spin-independent scattering, which is thought to protect them from backscattering and localization. Recently, experimental and theoretical efforts have provided strong evidence for the existence of both two-and three-dimensional classes of such topological insulator materials in semiconductor quantum well structures(6-8) and several bismuth-based compounds(9-13), but so far experiments have not probed the sensitivity of these chiral states to scattering. Here we use scanning tunnelling spectroscopy and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy to visualize the gapless surface states in the three-dimensional topological insulator Bi1-xSbx, and examine in detail the influence of scattering from disorder caused by random alloying in this compound. We show that, despite strong atomic scale disorder, backscattering between states of opposite momentum and opposite spin is absent. Our observations demonstrate that the chiral nature of these states protects the spin of the carriers. These chiral states are therefore potentially useful for spin-based electronics, in which long spin coherence is critical(14), and also for quantum computing applications, where topological protection can enable fault-tolerant information processing(15,16).","[Roushan, Pedram; Seo, Jungpil; Parker, Colin V.; Hsieh, D.; Qian, Dong; Richardella, Anthony; Hasan, M.

However, the full development of nanoplasmonics is hindered by the lack of devices that can generate coherent plasmonic fields. It has been proposed(3) that in the same way as a laser generates stimulated emission of coherent photons, a 'spaser' could generate stimulated emission of surface plasmons (oscillations of free electrons in metallic nanostructures) in resonating metallic nanostructures adjacent to a gain medium. But attempts to realize a spaser face the challenge of absorption loss in metal, which is particularly strong at optical frequencies. The suggestion(4-6) to compensate loss by optical gain in localized and propagating surface plasmons has been implemented recently(7-10) and even allowed the amplification of propagating surface plasmons in open paths(11). Still, these experiments and the reported enhancement of the stimulated emission of dye molecules in the presence of metallic nanoparticles(12-14) lack the feedback mechanism present in a spaser. Here we show that 44-nm-diameter nanoparticles with a gold core and dye-doped silica shell allow us to completely overcome the loss of localized surface plasmons by gain and realize a spaser. And in accord with the notion that only surface plasmon resonances are capable of squeezing optical frequency oscillations into a nanoscopic cavity to enable a true nanolaser(15-18), we show that outcoupling of surface plasmon oscillations to photonic modes at a wavelength of 531 nm makes our system the smallest nanolaser reported to date-and to our knowledge the first operating at visible wavelengths. We anticipate that now it has been realized experimentally, the spaser will advance our fundamental understanding of nanoplasmonics and the development of practical applications.","[Noginov, M.

These temperature reconstructions are based largely on terrestrial records from extra-tropical or high-elevation sites; however, global average surface temperature changes closely follow those of the global tropics(3), which are 75% ocean. In particular, the tropical Indo-Pacific warm pool (IPWP) represents a major heat reservoir that both influences global atmospheric circulation(4) and responds to remote northern high-latitude forcings(5,6). Here we present a decadally resolved continuous sea surface temperature (SST) reconstruction from the IPWP that spans the past two millennia and overlaps the instrumental record, enabling both a direct comparison of proxy data to the instrumental record and an evaluation of past changes in the context of twentieth century trends. Our record from the Makassar Strait, Indonesia, exhibits trends that are similar to a recent Northern Hemisphere temperature reconstruction(2). Reconstructed SST was, however, within error of modern values from about AD 1000 to AD 1250, towards the end of the Medieval Warm Period. SSTs during the Little Ice Age ( approximately AD 1550-1850) were variable, and similar to 0.5 to 1 degrees C colder than modern values during the coldest intervals. A companion reconstruction of delta O-18 of sea water-a sea surface salinity and hydrology indicator-indicates a tight coupling with the East Asian monsoon system and remote control of IPWP hydrology on centennial-millennial timescales, rather than a dominant influence from local SST variation.","[Oppo, Delia W.] Woods Hole Oceanog Inst, Dept Geol & Geophys, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA; [Rosenthal, Yair] Rutgers State Univ, Inst Marine & Coastal Sci, New Brunswick, NJ 08901 USA; [Rosenthal, Yair] Rutgers State Univ, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, New Brunswick, NJ 08901 USA; [Linsley, Braddock K.] SUNY Albany, Dept Atmospher & Environm Sci, Albany, NY 12222 USA","Oppo, DW (reprint author), Woods Hole Oceanog Inst, Dept Geol & Geophys, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA.",doppo@whoi.edu,,,US NSF; Ocean Climate Change Institute of WHOI,"We thank the following people and institutions for their support: Y.

They originate from more than a hundred fungal species belonging mainly to the genera Cladosporium, Penicillium, Alternaria and Aspergillus(1-4). Although these conidia contain many antigens and allergens(5-7), it is not known why airborne fungal microflora do not activate the host innate immune cells continuously and do not induce detrimental inflammatory responses following their inhalation. Here we show that the surface layer on the dormant conidia masks their recognition by the immune system and hence prevents immune response. To explore this, we used several fungal members of the airborne microflora, including the human opportunistic fungal pathogen Aspergillus fumigatus, in in vitro assays with dendritic cells and alveolar macrophages and in in vivo murine experiments. In A. fumigatus, this surface 'rodlet layer' is composed of hydrophobic RodA protein covalently bound to the conidial cell wall through glycosylphosphatidylinositol-remnants. RodA extracted from conidia of A. fumigatus was immunologically inert and did not induce dendritic cell or alveolar macrophage maturation and activation, and failed to activate helper T-cell immune responses in vivo. The removal of this surface 'rodlet/hydrophobin layer' either chemically (using hydrofluoric acid), genetically (Delta rodA mutant) or biologically (germination) resulted in conidial morphotypes inducing immune activation. All these observations show that the hydrophobic rodlet layer on the conidial cell surface immunologically silences airborne moulds.","[Aimanianda, Vishukumar; Clavaud, Cecile; Paris, Sophie; Latge, Jean-Paul] Inst Pasteur, Unite Aspergillus, F-75015 Paris, France; [Bayry, Jagadeesh; Elluru, Sri Ramulu; Kaveri, Srini V.] Univ Paris 06, INSERM, UMR S 872, U872, F-75006 Paris, France; [Bayry, Jagadeesh; Elluru, Sri Ramulu; Kaveri, Srini V.] Univ Paris 06, Ctr Rech Cordeliers, UMR S 872, F-75006 Paris, France; [Bayry, Jagadeesh; Elluru, Sri Ramulu; Kaveri, Srini V.] Univ Paris 05, UMR S 872, F-75006 Paris, France; [Bozza, Silvia; Romani, Luigina] Univ Perugia, Dept Expt Med & Biochem Sci, I-06122 Perugia, Italy; [Perruccio, Katia] Univ Perugia, Dept Clin & Expt Med, I-06122 Perugia, Italy; [Kniemeyer, Olaf; Brakhage, Axel A.] Leibniz Inst Nat Prod Res & Infect Biol HKI, Dept Mol & Appl Microbiol, D-07745 Jena, Germany; [Kniemeyer, Olaf; Brakhage, Axel A.] Univ Jena, D-07745 Jena, Germany","Latge, JP (reprint author), Inst Pasteur, Unite Aspergillus, F-75015 Paris, France.",jplatge@pasteur.fr,"Elluru, Sri Ramulu/B-1097-2009; Aimanianda, Vishukumar/E-9204-2011; Kniemeyer, Olaf/K-1253-2013; Latge, Jean Paul/C-9846-2014; Bayry, Jagadeesh/A-6589-2011; Marion-Poll, Frederic/D-8882-2011","Aimanianda, Vishukumar/0000-0001-5813-7497; Kniemeyer, Olaf/0000-0002-9493-6402; Marion-Poll, Frederic/0000-0001-6824-0180; Romani, Luigina/0000-0002-1356-525X; Elluru, Sri Ramulu/0000-0001-9188-710X; Kaveri, Srini/0000-0002-0837-4053; Bayry, Jagadeesh/0000-0003-0498-9808","Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG); EU-STREP [LSHB-CT-2004-511952, MANASP LSGBH37899]; INSERM; CNRS; Universities Paris 5 and 6","We thank J.

After antigen encounter, activated B cells initially seek T-cell help at the follicle-T-zone boundary and then move to interfollicular and T-zone distal ( outer) regions of the follicle(4-10). Subsequently, some cells move to the follicle centre, become germinal centre B cells and undergo antibody affinity maturation(1,2,11). Although germinal centres within follicles were described in 1885 (ref. 12), the molecular cues mediating segregation of B cells between the outer and centre follicle have remained undefined. Here we present a role for the orphan G-protein-coupled receptor, Epstein-Barr virus induced molecule-2 (EBI2, also known as GPR183)(13), in this process. EBI2 is expressed in mature B cells and increases in expression early after activation, before being downregulated in germinal centre B cells. EBI2 deficiency in mice led to a reduction in the early antibody response to a T-dependent antigen. EBI2-deficient B cells failed to move to the outer follicle at day 2 of activation, and instead were found in the follicle centre, whereas EBI2 overexpression was sufficient to promote B cell localization to the outer follicle. In mixed bone marrow chimaeras, EBI2-deficient B cells phenocopied germinal centre B cells in preferentially localizing to the follicle centre. When downregulation of EBI2 in wild-type B cells was antagonized, participation in the germinal centre reaction was impaired. These studies identify an important role for EBI2 in promoting B cell localization in the outer follicle, and show that differential expression of this receptor helps position B cells appropriately for mounting T-dependent antibody responses.","[Pereira, Joao P.; Kelly, Lisa M.; Xu, Ying; Cyster, Jason G.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Howard Hughes Med Inst, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; [Pereira, Joao P.; Kelly, Lisa M.; Xu, Ying; Cyster, Jason G.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Microbiol & Immunol, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA","Cyster, JG (reprint author), Univ Calif San Francisco, Howard Hughes Med Inst, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA.",Jason.Cyster@ucsf.edu,,,National Institutes of Health,"We thank C.

L1s must retrotranspose in the germ line or during early development to ensure their evolutionary success, yet the extent to which this process affects somatic cells is poorly understood. We previously demonstrated that engineered human L1s can retrotranspose in adult rat hippocampus progenitor cells in vitro and in the mouse brain in vivo(1). Here we demonstrate that neural progenitor cells isolated from human fetal brain and derived from human embryonic stem cells support the retrotransposition of engineered human L1s in vitro. Furthermore, we developed a quantitative multiplex polymerase chain reaction that detected an increase in the copy number of endogenous L1s in the hippocampus, and in several regions of adult human brains, when compared to the copy number of endogenous L1s in heart or liver genomic DNAs from the same donor. These data suggest that de novo L1 retrotransposition events may occur in the human brain and, in principle, have the potential to contribute to individual somatic mosaicism.","[Coufal, Nicole G.; Peng, Grace E.; Yeo, Gene W.; Mu, Yangling; Lovci, Michael T.; Gage, Fred H.] Salk Inst Biol Studies, Genet Lab, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; [Garcia-Perez, Jose L.; Moran, John V.] Univ Michigan, Sch Med, Dept Human Genet, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Garcia-Perez, Jose L.; Moran, John V.] Univ Michigan, Sch Med, Dept Internal Med, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Garcia-Perez, Jose L.] Univ Granada, Ctr Biomed Res, Andalusian Stem Cell Bank, Granada 18100, Spain; [Morell, Maria; O'Shea, K.

The efficiency of this process, however, is low(9). Pluripotency can be induced without c-Myc, but with even lower efficiency(10,11). A p53 (also known as TP53 in humans and Trp53 in mice) short-interfering RNA (siRNA) was recently shown to promote human iPS cell generation(12), but the specificity and mechanisms remain to be determined. Here we report that up to 10% of transduced mouse embryonic fibroblasts lacking p53 became iPS cells, even without the Myc retrovirus. The p53 deletion also promoted the induction of integration-free mouse iPS cells with plasmid transfection. Furthermore, in the p53-null background, iPS cells were generated from terminally differentiated T lymphocytes. The suppression of p53 also increased the efficiency of human iPS cell generation. DNA microarray analyses identified 34 p53-regulated genes that are common in mouse and human fibroblasts. Functional analyses of these genes demonstrate that the p53-p21 pathway serves as a barrier not only in tumorigenicity, but also in iPS cell generation.","[Hong, Hyenjong; Takahashi, Kazutoshi; Ichisaka, Tomoko; Aoi, Takashi; Nakagawa, Masato; Okita, Keisuke; Yamanaka, Shinya] Kyoto Univ, Inst Integrated Cell Mat Sci, Ctr iPS Cell Res & Applicat CiRA, Kyoto 6068507, Japan; [Hong, Hyenjong; Nakagawa, Masato; Yamanaka, Shinya] Kyoto Univ, Inst Frontier Med Sci, Dept Stem Cell Biol, Kyoto 6068507, Japan; [Ichisaka, Tomoko; Yamanaka, Shinya] Japan Sci & Technol Agcy, Yamanaka iPS Cell Special Project, Kawaguchi, Saitama 3320012, Japan; [Kanagawa, Osami] RIKEN Yokohama Inst, RIKEN Ctr Allergy & Immunol, Lab Autoimmune Regulat, Tsurumi Ku, Kanagawa 2300045, Japan; [Yamanaka, Shinya] Gladstone Inst Cardiovasc Dis, San Francisco, CA 94158 USA","Yamanaka, S (reprint author), Kyoto Univ, Inst Integrated Cell Mat Sci, Ctr iPS Cell Res & Applicat CiRA, Kyoto 6068507, Japan.",yamanaka@frontier.kyoto-u.ac.jp,,,Leading Project of MEXT; JSPS and MEXT; Program for Promotion of Fundamental Studies in Health Sciences of NIBIO; Japanese Government ( MEXT),"We thank D.

The Ink4/Arf locus comprises the Cdkn2a Cdkn2b genes encoding three potent tumour suppressors, namely p16 Ink4a, p19 Arf and p15 Ink4b, which are basally expressed in differentiated cells and upregulated by aberrant mitogenic signals(2-4). Here we show that the locus is completely silenced in iPS cells, as well as in embryonic stem (ES) cells, acquiring the epigenetic marks of a bivalent chromatin domain, and retaining the ability to be reactivated after differentiation. Cell culture conditions during reprogramming enhance the expression of the Ink4/Arf locus, further highlighting the importance of silencing the locus to allow proliferation and reprogramming. Indeed, the three factors together repress the Ink4/Arf locus soon after their expression and concomitant with the appearance of the first molecular markers of 'stemness'. This downregulation also occurs in cells carrying the oncoprotein large-T, which functionally inactivates the pathways regulated by the Ink4/Arf locus, thus indicating that the silencing of the locus is intrinsic to reprogramming and not the result of a selective process. Genetic inhibition of the Ink4/Arf locus has a profound positive effect on the efficiency of iPS cell generation, increasing both the kinetics of reprogramming and the number of emerging iPS cell colonies. In murine cells, Arf, rather than Ink4a, is the main barrier to reprogramming by activation of p53 (encoded by Trp53) and p21 (encoded by Cdkn1a); whereas, in human fibroblasts, INK4a is more important than ARF. Furthermore, organismal ageing upregulates the Ink4/Arf locus(2,5) and, accordingly, reprogramming is less efficient in cells from old organisms, but this defect can be rescued by inhibiting the locus with a short hairpin RNA. All together, we conclude that the silencing of Ink4/Arf locus is rate-limiting for reprogramming, and its transient inhibition may significantly improve the generation of iPS cells.","[Li, Han; Collado, Manuel; Villasante, Aranzazu; Serrano, Manuel] Spanish Natl Canc Res Ctr CNIO, Tumor Suppress Grp, E-28029 Madrid, Spain; [Strati, Katerina; Blasco, Maria A.] Spanish Natl Canc Res Ctr CNIO, Telomeres & Telomerase Grp, E-28029 Madrid, Spain; [Ortega, Sagrario] Spanish Natl Canc Res Ctr CNIO, Transgen Mice Unit, E-28029 Madrid, Spain; [Canamero, Marta] Spanish Natl Canc Res Ctr CNIO, Comparat Pathol Unit, E-28029 Madrid, Spain","Serrano, M (reprint author), Spanish Natl Canc Res Ctr CNIO, Tumor Suppress Grp, 3 Melchor Fernandez Almagro St, E-28029 Madrid, Spain.",mserrano@cnio.es,"Serrano, Manuel/H-2634-2015; Collado, Manuel/K-8140-2014; Blasco , Maria A./M-1694-2014; Villasante, Aranzazu/A-9100-2017","Serrano, Manuel/0000-0001-7177-9312; Collado, Manuel/0000-0002-0330-0880; Blasco , Maria A./0000-0002-4211-233X; Villasante, Aranzazu/0000-0001-7919-9670; Strati, Katerina/0000-0002-2332-787X","Spanish Ministry of Science (MICINN).; 'Ramon y Cajal' contract (MICINN).; Regional Government of Madrid; European Union; European Research Council (ERC),; 'Marcelino Botin' Foundation","We thank S.

We address both issues by investigating the mechanisms limiting reprogramming efficiency in somatic cells. Here we show that reprogramming factors can activate the p53 (also known as Trp53 in mice, TP53 in humans) pathway. Reducing signalling to p53 by expressing a mutated version of one of its negative regulators, by deleting or knocking down p53 or its target gene, p21 (also known as Cdkn1a), or by antagonizing reprogramming-induced apoptosis in mouse fibroblasts increases reprogramming efficiency. Notably, decreasing p53 protein levels enabled fibroblasts to give rise to iPS cells capable of generating germline-transmitting chimaeric mice using only Oct4 ( also known as Pou5f1) and Sox2. Furthermore, silencing of p53 significantly increased the reprogramming efficiency of human somatic cells. These results provide insights into reprogramming mechanisms and suggest new routes to more efficient reprogramming while minimizing the use of oncogenes.","[Kawamura, Teruhisa; Suzuki, Jotaro; Wang, Yunyuan V.; Wahl, Geoffrey M.; Izpisua Belmonte, Juan Carlos] Salk Inst Biol Studies, Gene Express Lab, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; [Kawamura, Teruhisa] Kyoto Univ, Career Path Promot Unit Young Life Scientists, Kyoto 6068501, Japan; [Wang, Yunyuan V.] Astellas Pharma Inc, Drug Discovery Res, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058585, Japan; [Menendez, Sergio; Batlle Morera, Laura; Raya, Angel; Izpisua Belmonte, Juan Carlos] Ctr Regenerat Med Barcelona, Barcelona 08003, Spain; [Raya, Angel] ICREA, Barcelona 08010, Spain; [Raya, Angel] Networking Ctr Biomed Res Bioengn Biomat & Nanome, Barcelona 08003, Spain","Belmonte, JCI (reprint author), Salk Inst Biol Studies, Gene Express Lab, 10010 N Torrey Pines Rd, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA.",wahl@salk.edu; belmonte@salk.edu,"Raya, Angel/E-6205-2010","Raya, Angel/0000-0003-2189-9775; BATLLE MORERA, LAURA/0000-0002-6924-9002","Astellas Pharma Inc; Japan Society for the Promotion of Science; NIH [5 R01 CA061449, CA100845]; Leila Y.

The extremely low efficiency and slow kinetics of in vitro reprogramming suggest that further rare events are required to generate iPS cells. The nature and identity of these events, however, remain elusive. We noticed that the reprogramming potential of primary murine fibroblasts into iPS cells decreases after serial passaging and the concomitant onset of senescence. Consistent with the notion that loss of replicative potential provides a barrier for reprogramming, here we show that cells with low endogenous p19(Arf) (encoded by the Ink4a/Arf locus, also known as Cdkn2a locus) protein levels and immortal fibroblasts deficient in components of the Arf-Trp53 pathway yield iPS cell colonies with up to threefold faster kinetics and at a significantly higher efficiency than wild-type cells, endowing almost every somatic cell with the potential to form iPS cells. Notably, the acute genetic ablation of Trp53 (also known as p53) in cellular sub-populations that normally fail to reprogram rescues their ability to produce iPS cells. Our results show that the acquisition of immortality is a crucial and rate-limiting step towards the establishment of a pluripotent state in somatic cells and underscore the similarities between induced pluripotency and tumorigenesis.","[Utikal, Jochen; Polo, Jose M.; Stadtfeld, Matthias; Maherali, Nimet; Kulalert, Warakorn; Walsh, Ryan M.; Khalil, Adam; Hochedlinger, Konrad] Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Ctr Canc, Boston, MA 02114 USA; [Utikal, Jochen; Polo, Jose M.; Stadtfeld, Matthias; Maherali, Nimet; Kulalert, Warakorn; Walsh, Ryan M.; Khalil, Adam; Hochedlinger, Konrad] Harvard Stem Cell Inst, Ctr Regenerat Med, Boston, MA 02114 USA; [Utikal, Jochen; Polo, Jose M.; Stadtfeld, Matthias; Maherali, Nimet; Kulalert, Warakorn; Walsh, Ryan M.; Khalil, Adam; Hochedlinger, Konrad] Harvard Univ, Dept Stem Cell & Regenerat Biol, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Utikal, Jochen] Univ Heidelberg, Univ Med Ctr Mannheim, Dept Dermatol Venereol & Allergol, D-68135 Mannheim, Germany; [Maherali, Nimet] Harvard Univ, Dept Mol & Cellular Biol, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Rheinwald, James G.] Brigham & Womens Hosp, Dept Dermatol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Rheinwald, James G.] Harvard Skin Dis Res Ctr, Boston, MA 02115 USA","Hochedlinger, K (reprint author), Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Ctr Canc, 185 Cambridge St, Boston, MA 02114 USA.",khochedlinger@helix.mgh.harvard.edu,,"Polo, Jose M/0000-0002-2531-778X; Stadtfeld, Matthias/0000-0002-5852-9906; Utikal, Jochen/0000-0001-5316-0241",Mildred Scheel Foundation; ECOR fellowship; Schering Foundation; NIH Skin Disease Research Center Grant; Natural Sciences and Engineering Council of Canada; NIH Director's Innovator Award; Harvard Stem Cell Institute; Kimmel Foundation and the V Foundation,"We thank M.

We recently reported that cells with short telomeres cannot be reprogrammed to iPS cells despite their normal proliferation rates(1,2), probably reflecting the existence of 'reprogramming barriers' that abort the reprogramming of cells with uncapped telomeres. Here we show that p53 (also known as Trp53 in mice and TP53 in humans) is critically involved in preventing the reprogramming of cells carrying various types of DNA damage, including short telomeres, DNA repair deficiencies, or exogenously inflicted DNA damage. Reprogramming in the presence of pre-existing, but tolerated, DNA damage is aborted by the activation of a DNA damage response and p53-dependent apoptosis. Abrogation of p53 allows efficient reprogramming in the face of DNA damage and the generation of iPS cells carrying persistent DNA damage and chromosomal aberrations. These observations indicate that during reprogramming cells increase their intolerance to different types of DNA damage and that p53 is critical in preventing the generation of human and mouse pluripotent cells from suboptimal parental cells.","[Marion, Rosa M.; Strati, Katerina; Blanco, Raquel; Blasco, Maria A.] Spanish Natl Canc Res Ctr CNIO, Telomeres & Telomerase Grp, E-28029 Madrid, Spain; [Li, Han; Serrano, Manuel] Spanish Natl Canc Res Ctr CNIO, Tumor Suppress Grp, E-28029 Madrid, Spain; [Murga, Matilde; Fernandez-Capetillo, Oscar] Spanish Natl Canc Res Ctr CNIO, Genet Instabil Grp, Mol Oncol Program, E-28029 Madrid, Spain; [Ortega, Sagrario] Spanish Natl Canc Res Ctr CNIO, Biotechnol Program, Transgen Mice Unit, E-28029 Madrid, Spain","Blasco, MA (reprint author), Spanish Natl Canc Res Ctr CNIO, Telomeres & Telomerase Grp, Melchor Fernandez Almagro 3, E-28029 Madrid, Spain.",mblasco@cnio.es,"Serrano, Manuel/H-2634-2015; Fernandez-Capetillo, Oscar/H-3508-2015; Marion , Rosa/L-1488-2015; Blasco , Maria A./M-1694-2014","Serrano, Manuel/0000-0001-7177-9312; Fernandez-Capetillo, Oscar/0000-0002-2690-6885; Marion , Rosa/0000-0002-0374-3884; Blasco , Maria A./0000-0002-4211-233X; Strati, Katerina/0000-0002-2332-787X",Spanish Association Against Cancer (AECC); MICINN (CONSOLIDER); Regional Government of Madrid; European Union; European Research Council (ERC); AECC; Korber European Research Award,"We thank R.

PRDM16 (PR domain containing 16) is a 140 kDa zinc finger protein that robustly induces brown fat determination and differentiation(2). Recent data suggests that brown fat cells arise in vivo from a Myf5-positive, myoblastic lineage by the action of PRDM16 (ref. 3); however, the molecular mechanisms responsible for this developmental switch is unclear. Here we show that PRDM16 forms a transcriptional complex with the active form of C/EBP-beta ( also known as LAP), acting as a critical molecular unit that controls the cell fate switch from myoblastic precursors to brown fat cells. Forced expression of PRDM16 and C/EBP-beta is sufficient to induce a fully functional brown fat program in naive fibroblastic cells, including skin fibroblasts from mouse and man. Transplantation of fibroblasts expressing these two factors into mice gives rise to an ectopic fat pad with the morphological and biochemical characteristics of brown fat. Like endogenous brown fat, this synthetic brown fat tissue acts as a sink for glucose uptake, as determined by positron emission tomography with fluorodeoxyglucose. These data indicate that the PRDM16-C/EBP-beta complex initiates brown fat formation from myoblastic precursors, and may provide opportunities for the development of new therapeutics for obesity and type-2 diabetes.","[Kajimura, Shingo; Seale, Patrick; Spiegelman, Bruce M.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dana Farber Canc Inst, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Kajimura, Shingo; Seale, Patrick; Kubota, Kazuishi; Gygi, Steven P.; Spiegelman, Bruce M.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Cell Biol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Lunsford, Elaine; Frangioni, John V.] Beth Israel Deaconess Med Ctr, Div Hematol Oncol, Boston, MA 02215 USA","Spiegelman, BM (reprint author), Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dana Farber Canc Inst, 44 Binney St, Boston, MA 02115 USA.",bruce_spiegelman@dfci.harvard.edu,,,"AHA [0930125N]; National Institutes of Health ( NIH) [DK081605, HG3456, GM67945]; Picower Foundation [DK31405]; NIH/NCRR [S10-RR-023010]","We are grateful to S.

The activation of NADPH oxidase in response to plasma membrane receptor activation depends on the phosphorylation of cytoplasmic oxidase subunits, their translocation to membranes and the assembly of all NADPH oxidase components(3). Tumour necrosis factor (TNF) is a prominent stimulus of ROS production, but the molecular mechanisms by which TNF activates NADPH oxidase are poorly understood. Here we identify riboflavin kinase (RFK, formerly known as flavokinase(4)) as a previously unrecognized TNF-receptor-1 (TNFR1)-binding protein that physically and functionally couples TNFR1 to NADPH oxidase. In mouse and human cells, RFK binds to both the TNFR1-death domain and to p22(phox), the common subunit of NADPH oxidase isoforms. RFK-mediated bridging of TNFR1 and p22(phox) is a pre-requisite for TNF-induced but not for Toll-like-receptor-induced ROS production. Exogenous flavin mononucleotide or FAD was able to substitute fully for TNF stimulation of NADPH oxidase in RFK-deficient cells. RFK is rate-limiting in the synthesis of FAD, an essential prosthetic group of NADPH oxidase. The results suggest that TNF, through the activation of RFK, enhances the incorporation of FAD in NADPH oxidase enzymes, a critical step for the assembly and activation of NADPH oxidase.","[Yazdanpanah, Benjamin; Wiegmann, Katja; Krut, Oleg; Pongratz, Carola; Schramm, Michael; Kashkar, Hamid; Utermoehlen, Olaf; Kroenke, Martin] Univ Cologne, Inst Med Microbiol Immunol & Hyg, D-50935 Cologne, Germany; [Yazdanpanah, Benjamin; Krut, Oleg; Kashkar, Hamid; Utermoehlen, Olaf; Bruening, Jens C.; Kroenke, Martin] Univ Cologne, Ctr Mol Med Cologne, D-50935 Cologne, Germany; [Kleinridders, Andre; Wunderlich, Thomas; Bruening, Jens C.] Univ Cologne, Inst Genet, D-50935 Cologne, Germany; [Tchikov, Vladimir; Schuetze, Stefan] Univ Kiel, Inst Immunol, D-24105 Kiel, Germany; [Kashkar, Hamid; Bruening, Jens C.; Kroenke, Martin] Cologne Cluster Excellence Cellular Stress Respon, D-50674 Cologne, Germany","Kronke, M (reprint author), Univ Cologne, Inst Med Microbiol Immunol & Hyg, D-50935 Cologne, Germany.",m.kroenke@uni-koeln.de,"Schutze, Stefan/C-8596-2011",,"Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft [SFB670, SFB415, 733/7-1]; DFG Leibniz programme","We thank M.

Here we demonstrate that Drosophila Atlastin-the fly homologue of the mammalian GTPase atlastin 1 involved in hereditary spastic paraplegia-localizes on ER membranes and that its loss causes ER fragmentation. Drosophila Atlastin embedded in distinct membranes has the ability to form trans-oligomeric complexes and its overexpression induces enlargement of ER profiles, consistent with excessive fusion of ER membranes. In vitro experiments confirm that Atlastin autonomously drives membrane fusion in a GTP-dependent fashion. In contrast, GTPase-deficient Atlastin is inactive, unable to form trans-oligomeric complexes owing to failure to self-associate, and incapable of promoting fusion in vitro. These results demonstrate that Atlastin mediates membrane tethering and fusion and strongly suggest that it is the GTPase activity that is required for ER homotypic fusion.","[Orso, Genny; Pendin, Diana; Tosetto, Jessica; Martinuzzi, Andrea; Daga, Andrea] Eugenio Medea Sci Inst, I-31015 Conegliano, Italy; [Liu, Song; Moss, Tyler J.; Faust, Joseph E.; McNew, James A.] Rice Univ, Dept Biochem & Cell Biol, Houston, TX 77005 USA; [Tosetto, Jessica] Univ Padua, Dept Pharmacol, I-35131 Padua, Italy; [Micaroni, Massimo] Univ Queensland, Inst Mol Biosci, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia; [Egorova, Anastasia] Ist Ric Farmacol Mario Negri, Consorzio Mario Negri Sud, Dept Cell Biol & Oncol, I-66030 Santa Maria Imbaro, Italy; [Daga, Andrea] Eugenio Medea Sci Inst, Dulbecco Telethon Inst, I-35131 Padua, Italy; [Daga, Andrea] Univ Calif Los Angeles, David Geffen Sch Med, Dept Neurol, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA","Daga, A (reprint author), Eugenio Medea Sci Inst, I-31015 Conegliano, Italy.",mcnew@rice.edu; daga@unipd.it,"Liu, Song/E-2254-2011; orso, genny/C-6492-2016; Martinuzzi, Andrea/K-3887-2016; Pendin, Diana/K-7868-2016","orso, genny/0000-0002-2959-8806; Martinuzzi, Andrea/0000-0002-0319-3579; Pendin, Diana/0000-0003-2827-935X; Moss, Tyler/0000-0001-7140-9987; Faust, Joseph/0000-0002-2183-8529; McNew, James/0000-0001-8459-3664",National Institutes of Health [GM71832]; G.

We found that the 4.2-kilobase HXT13-DSF1 region sharing divergent homology with chromosomes IV, X and XIV, similar to mammalian segmental duplications, was 'at risk' for participating in duplication-mediated GCRs generated by homologous recombination. Numerous genes and pathways, including SGS1, TOP3, RMI1, SRS2, RAD6, SLX1, SLX4, SLX5, MSH2, MSH6, RAD10 and the DNA replication stress checkpoint requiring MRC1 and TOF1, were highly specific for suppressing these GCRs compared to GCRs mediated by single-copy sequences.

This explains how extensive genome instability is prevented in eukaryotic cells whose genomes contain numerous divergent repeated sequences.","[Putnam, Christopher D.; Hayes, Tikvah K.; Kolodner, Richard D.] Univ Calif San Diego, Sch Med, Dept Med, Ludwig Inst Canc Res, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Putnam, Christopher D.; Hayes, Tikvah K.; Kolodner, Richard D.] Univ Calif San Diego, Sch Med, Dept Cellular & Mol Med, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Putnam, Christopher D.; Hayes, Tikvah K.; Kolodner, Richard D.] Univ Calif San Diego, Sch Med, Ctr Canc, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA","Kolodner, RD (reprint author), Univ Calif San Diego, Sch Med, Dept Med, Ludwig Inst Canc Res, 9500 Gilman Dr, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.",rkolodner@ucsd.edu,,"Putnam, Christopher/0000-0002-6145-1265",NIH [GM26017],"Acknowledgements We thank the UCSD Microarray Core Facility for assistance in the aCGH experiments and C.

It should carry unique signatures from the earliest epochs in the evolution of the Universe, inaccessible to standard astrophysical observations(1). Direct measurements of the amplitude of this background are therefore of fundamental importance for understanding the evolution of the Universe when it was younger than one minute. Here we report limits on the amplitude of the stochastic gravitational-wave background using the data from a two-year science run of the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory(2) (LIGO). Our result constrains the energy density of the stochastic gravitational-wave background normalized by the critical energy density of the Universe, in the frequency band around 100 Hz, to be <6.9 X 10(-6) at 95% confidence. The data rule out models of early Universe evolution with relatively large equation-of-state parameter(3), as well as cosmic (super) string models with relatively small string tension(4) that are favoured in some string theory models(5). This search for the stochastic background improves on the indirect limits from Big Bang nucleosynthesis(1,6) and cosmic microwave background(7) at 100Hz.","[Harms, J.; Kandhasamy, S.; Mandic, V.] Univ Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA; [Abbott, B.

For a trapped gas, the spatially varying local chemical potential gives rise to multiple quantum phases within a single sample, complicating the interpretation of bulk measurements(1-5). Here we report spatially resolved, in-situ imaging of a two-dimensional ultracold atomic gas as it crosses the superfluid to Mott insulator transition, providing direct access to individual characteristics of the insulating, superfluid and normal phases. We present results for the local compressibility in all phases, observing a strong suppression in the insulator domain and suppressed density fluctuations for the Mott insulator, in accordance with the fluctuation-dissipation theorem. Furthermore, we obtain a direct measure of the finite temperature of the system. Taken together, these methods enable a complete characterization of multiple phases in a strongly correlated Bose gas, and of the interplay between quantum and thermal fluctuations in the quantum critical regime.","[Chin, Cheng] Univ Chicago, James Franck Inst, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; Univ Chicago, Dept Phys, Chicago, IL 60637 USA","Chin, C (reprint author), Univ Chicago, James Franck Inst, 5640 S Ellis Ave, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.",cchin@uchicago.edu,,,"NSF [PHY-0747907, NSF-MRSEC, DMR-0213745]; ARO [W911NF0710576]; DARPA OLE programme; Grainger Foundation","We thank T.

Some regions are becoming overly dependent on it, consuming groundwater faster than it is naturally replenished and causing water tables to decline unremittingly(1). Indirect evidence suggests that this is the case in northwest India(2), but there has been no regional assessment of the rate of groundwater depletion. Here we use terrestrial water storage-change observations from the NASA Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment satellites(3) and simulated soil-water variations from a data-integrating hydrological modelling system(4) to show that groundwater is being depleted at a mean rate of 4.0 +/- 1.0 cm yr(-1) equivalent height of water (17.7 +/- 4.5 km(3) yr(-1)) over the Indian states of Rajasthan, Punjab and Haryana (including Delhi). During our study period of August 2002 to October 2008, groundwater depletion was equivalent to a net loss of 109 km(3) of water, which is double the capacity of India's largest surface-water reservoir. Annual rainfall was close to normal throughout the period and we demonstrate that the other terrestrial water storage components (soil moisture, surface waters, snow, glaciers and biomass) did not contribute significantly to the observed decline in total water levels. Although our observational record is brief, the available evidence suggests that unsustainable consumption of groundwater for irrigation and other anthropogenic uses is likely to be the cause. If measures are not taken soon to ensure sustainable groundwater usage, the consequences for the 114,000,000 residents of the region may include a reduction of agricultural output and shortages of potable water, leading to extensive socioeconomic stresses.","[Rodell, Matthew] NASA, Goddard Space Flight Ctr, Hydrol Sci Branch, Greenbelt, MD 20771 USA; [Velicogna, Isabella; Famiglietti, James S.] Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Earth Syst Sci, Irvine, CA 92697 USA; [Velicogna, Isabella] CALTECH, Jet Prop Lab, Pasadena, CA 91109 USA; [Velicogna, Isabella] Univ Udine, Dept Phys, I-33100 Udine, Italy","Rodell, M (reprint author), NASA, Goddard Space Flight Ctr, Hydrol Sci Branch, Code 614-3, Greenbelt, MD 20771 USA.",matthew.rodell@nasa.gov,"Rodell, Matthew/E-4946-2012; Famiglietti, James/G-7383-2017","Rodell, Matthew/0000-0003-0106-7437; Famiglietti, James/0000-0002-6053-5379",NASA's Solid Earth; Natural Hazards Program; Terrestrial Hydrology Program; Cryospheric Science Program,"We thank H.

The amount and distribution of water within the mantle thus has profound implications for the dynamics and geochemical evolution of the Earth(4,5). Electrical conductivity is also highly sensitive to the presence of hydrogen in mantle minerals(6). The mantle transition zone minerals wadsleyite and ringwoodite in particular have high water solubility(4), and recent high pressure experiments show that the electrical conductivity of these minerals is very sensitive to water content(7-9). Thus estimates of the electrical conductivity of the mantle transition zone derived from electromagnetic induction studies have the potential to constrain the water content of this region. Here we invert long period geomagnetic response functions to derive a global-scale three-dimensional model of electrical conductivity variations in the Earth's mantle, revealing variations in the electrical conductivity of the transition zone of approximately one order of magnitude. Conductivities are high in cold, seismically fast, areas where slabs have subducted into or through the transition zone. Significant variations in water content throughout the transition zone provide a plausible explanation for the observed patterns. Our results support the view(10,11) that at least some of the water in the transition zone has been carried into that region by cold subducting slabs.","[Kelbert, Anna; Schultz, Adam; Egbert, Gary] Oregon State Univ, Coll Ocean & Atmospher Sci, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA","Kelbert, A (reprint author), Oregon State Univ, Coll Ocean & Atmospher Sci, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA.",anya@coas.oregonstate.edu,"Schultz, Adam/K-7394-2012","Egbert, Gary/0000-0003-1276-8538; Kelbert, Anna/0000-0003-4395-398X; Schultz, Adam/0000-0003-1663-1547",US National Science Foundation [EAR-0739111]; US National Aeronautics and Space Administration [NNX08AG04G],We acknowledge support from the US National Science Foundation ( grant number EAR-0739111) and from the US National Aeronautics and Space Administration ( grant number NNX08AG04G).

Although the causal factors are well known for many synchronized phenomena, several processes concurrently have an impact on spatial synchrony of species, making their separate effects and interactions difficult to quantify. Here we develop a general stochastic model of predator-prey spatial dynamics to predict the outcome of a laboratory microcosm experiment testing for interactions among all known synchronizing factors: ( 1) dispersal of individuals between populations; ( 2) spatially synchronous fluctuations in exogenous environmental factors ( the Moran effect); and ( 3) interactions with other species ( for example, predators) that are themselves spatially synchronized. The Moran effect synchronized populations of the ciliate protist Tetrahymena pyriformis; however, dispersal only synchronized prey populations in the presence of the predator Euplotes patella. Both model and data indicate that synchrony depends on cyclic dynamics generated by the predator. Dispersal, but not the Moran effect, 'phase-locks' cycles, which otherwise become 'decoherent' and drift out of phase. In the absence of cycles, phase-locking is not possible and the synchronizing effect of dispersal is negligible. Interspecific interactions determine population synchrony, not by providing an additional source of synchronized fluctuations, but by altering population dynamics and thereby enhancing the action of dispersal. Our results are robust to wide variation in model parameters representative of many natural predator-prey or host-pathogen systems. This explains why cyclic systems provide many of the most dramatic examples of spatial synchrony in nature.","[Vasseur, David A.] Yale Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Fox, Jeremy W.] Univ Calgary, Dept Biol Sci, Calgary, AB T2N 1N4, Canada","Vasseur, DA (reprint author), Yale Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, New Haven, CT 06520 USA.",david.vasseur@yale.edu,"Vasseur, David/A-2545-2013",,Alberta Ingenuity; NSERC,"A.

The genome of AK1 was determined by an exacting, combined approach that included whole-genome shot-gun sequencing (27.8x coverage), targeted bacterial artificial chromosome sequencing, and high-resolution comparative genomic hybridization using custom microarrays featuring more than 24 million probes. Alignment to the NCBI reference, a composite of several ethnic clades(5,6), disclosed nearly 3.45 million single nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs), including 10,162 non-synonymous SNPs, and 170,202 deletion or insertion polymorphisms (indels). SNP and indel densities were strongly correlated genome-wide. Applying very conservative criteria yielded highly reliable copy number variants for clinical considerations.

Specifically, differences in the activity of converging inputs are thought to cause the elimination of synapses from less active inputs and increase connectivity with more active inputs(1,2). Here we present findings that challenge the generality of this notion and offer a new view of the role of activity in synapse development. To imbalance neurotransmission from different sets of inputs in vivo, we generated transgenic mice in which ON but not OFF types of bipolar cells in the retina express tetanus toxin ( TeNT). During development, retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) select between ON and OFF bipolar cell inputs ( ON or OFF RGCs) or establish a similar number of synapses with both on separate dendritic arborizations (ON-OFF RGCs). In TeNT retinas, ON RGCs correctly selected the silenced ON bipolar cell inputs over the transmitting OFF bipolar cells, but were connected with them through fewer synapses at maturity. Time-lapse imaging revealed that this was caused by a reduced rate of synapse formation rather than an increase in synapse elimination. Similarly, TeNT-expressing ON bipolar cell axons generated fewer presynaptic active zones. The remaining active zones often recruited multiple, instead of single, synaptic ribbons. ON-OFF RGCs in TeNT mice maintained convergence of ON and OFF bipolar cells inputs and had fewer synapses on their ON arbor without changes to OFF arbor synapses. Our results reveal an unexpected and remarkably selective role for activity in circuit development in vivo, regulating synapse formation but not elimination, affecting synapse number but not dendritic or axonal patterning, and mediating independently the refinement of connections from parallel (ON and OFF) processing streams even where they converge onto the same postsynaptic cell.","[Kerschensteiner, Daniel; Morgan, Josh L.; Lewis, Renate M.; Wong, Rachel O.

Recently, a new strain of influenza A virus was detected that causes disease in and transmits among humans, probably owing to little or no pre-existing immunity to the new strain. On 11 June 2009 the World Health Organization declared that the infections caused by the new strain had reached pandemic proportion. Characterized as an influenza A virus of the H1N1 subtype, the genomic segments of the new strain were most closely related to swine viruses(1). Most human infections with swine-origin H1N1 influenza viruses (S-OIVs) seem to be mild; however, a substantial number of hospitalized individuals do not have underlying health issues, attesting to the pathogenic potential of S-OIVs. To achieve a better assessment of the risk posed by the new virus, we characterized one of the first US S-OIV isolates, A/California/04/09 ( H1N1; hereafter referred to as CA04), as well as several other S-OIV isolates, in vitro and in vivo. In mice and ferrets, CA04 and other S- OIV isolates tested replicate more efficiently than a currently circulating human H1N1 virus. In addition, CA04 replicates efficiently in non-human primates, causes more severe pathological lesions in the lungs of infected mice, ferrets and non-human primates than a currently circulating human H1N1 virus, and transmits among ferrets. In specific-pathogen-free miniature pigs, CA04 replicates without clinical symptoms. The assessment of human sera from different age groups suggests that infection with human H1N1 viruses antigenically closely related to viruses circulating in 1918 confers neutralizing antibody activity to CA04. Finally, we show that CA04 is sensitive to approved and experimental antiviral drugs, suggesting that these compounds could function as a first line of defence against the recently declared S- OIV pandemic.","[Itoh, Yasushi; Makino, Akiko; Kawaoka, Yoshihiro] Kobe Univ, Dept Microbiol & Infect Dis, Kobe, Hyogo 6500017, Japan; [Itoh, Yasushi; Ishigaki, Hirohito; Nakayama, Misako; Ogasawara, Kazumasa] Shiga Univ Med Sci, Dept Pathol, Shiga 5202192, Japan; [Kiso, Maki; Tamura, Daisuke; Sakai-Tagawa, Yuko; Sakabe, Saori; Yamada, Shinya; Murakami, Shin; Imai, Hirotaka; Kakugawa, Satoshi; Ito, Mutsumi; Takano, Ryo; Iwatsuki-Horimoto, Kiyoko; Shimojima, Masayuki; Horimoto, Taisuke; Goto, Hideo; Takahashi, Kei; Kawaoka, Yoshihiro] Univ Tokyo, Inst Med Sci, Dept Microbiol & Immunol, Div Virol, Tokyo 1088639, Japan; [Watanabe, Tokiko; Hatta, Masato; Imai, Masaki; Hatta, Yasuko; Watanabe, Shinji; Li, Chengjun; Suresh, M.; Ozawa, Makoto; Neumann, Gabriele; Kawaoka, Yoshihiro] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Pathobiol Sci, Madison, WI 53711 USA; [Sakoda, Yoshihiro; Okamatsu, Masatoshi; Kida, Hiroshi] Hokkaido Univ, Grad Sch Vet Med, Dept Dis Control, Sapporo, Hokkaido 0600818, Japan; [Muramoto, Yukiko; Fujii, Ken; Kawaoka, Yoshihiro] ERATO Infect Induced Host Responses Project, Kawaguchi, Saitama 3320012, Japan; [Noda, Takeshi; Kawaoka, Yoshihiro] Univ Tokyo, Inst Med Sci, Int Res Ctr Infect Dis, Dept Special Pathogens, Tokyo 1088639, Japan; [Takahashi, Kazuo] Osaka Prefectural Inst Publ Hlth, Dept Infect Dis, Osaka 5370025, Japan; [Warshauer, David; Shult, Peter A.] Wisconsin State Lab Hyg, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Saito, Reiko; Suzuki, Hiroshi] Niigata Univ, Grad Sch Med & Dent Sci, Dept Publ Hlth, Niigata 9518510, Japan; [Furuta, Yousuke] Toyama Chem Co Ltd, Toyama 9308508, Japan; [Yamashita, Makoto] Daiichi Sankyo Co Ltd, Tokyo 1408710, Japan; [Mitamura, Keiko; Nakano, Kunio; Nakamura, Morio] Eiju Gen Hosp, Tokyo 1108654, Japan; [Brockman-Schneider, Rebecca; Gern, James] Univ Wisconsin, Sch Med & Publ Hlth, Madison, WI 53792 USA; [Mitamura, Hiroshi] Mitamura Clin, Dept Internal Med, Shizuoka 4130103, Japan; [Yamazaki, Masahiko] Childrens Clin, Dept Pediat, Kanagawa 2280023, Japan; [Sugaya, Norio] Keiyu Hosp, Kanagawa 2200012, Japan; [Kawaoka, Yoshihiro] Hokkaido Univ, Creat Res Initiat, Sapporo, Hokkaido 0600818, Japan","Kawaoka, Y (reprint author), Kobe Univ, Dept Microbiol & Infect Dis, Kobe, Hyogo 6500017, Japan.",kawaokay@svm.vetmed.wisc.edu,"Kida, Hiroshi/F-7244-2012; Okamatsu, Masatoshi/F-9124-2012; Sakoda, Yoshihiro/A-5183-2012; Wei, Jianjian/F-7788-2011","Wei, Jianjian/0000-0001-8859-8462","Centers for Disease Control (CDC) [A/California/04/09, A/Netherlands/603/09]; National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Public Health Service; NIAID [HHSN266200700010C]; Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology; Ministry of Health and by ERATO ( Japan Science and Technology Agency)","We thank the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) for A/California/04/09 virus and R.

Deepwater rice has evolved and adapted to flooding by acquiring the ability to significantly elongate its internodes, which have hollow structures and function as snorkels to allow gas exchange with the atmosphere, and thus prevent drowning(1-3). Many physiological studies have shown that the phytohormones ethylene, gibberellin and abscisic acid are involved in this response(4-8), but the gene(s) responsible for this trait has not been identified. Here we show the molecular mechanism of deepwater response through the identification of the genes SNORKEL1 and SNORKEL2, which trigger deepwater response by encoding ethylene response factors involved in ethylene signalling. Under deepwater conditions, ethylene accumulates in the plant and induces expression of these two genes. The products of SNORKEL1 and SNORKEL2 then trigger remarkable internode elongation via gibberellin. We also demonstrate that the introduction of three quantitative trait loci from deepwater rice into non-deepwater rice enabled the latter to become deepwater rice. This discovery will contribute to rice breeding in lowland areas that are frequently flooded during the rainy season.","[Hattori, Yoko; Nagai, Keisuke; Furukawa, Shizuka; Song, Xian-Jun; Kitano, Hidemi; Matsuoka, Makoto; Ashikari, Motoyuki] Nagoya Univ, Biosci & Biotechnol Ctr, Nagoya, Aichi 4648601, Japan; [Mori, Hitoshi] Nagoya Univ, Grad Sch Bioagr Sci, Nagoya, Aichi 4648601, Japan; [Kawano, Ritsuko; Yoshimura, Atsushi] Kyushu Univ, Sch Agr, Fukuoka 8128581, Japan; [Sakakibara, Hitoshi] RIKEN, Plant Sci Ctr, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2300045, Japan; [Wu, Jianzhong; Matsumoto, Takashi] Natl Inst Agrobiol Resources, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058602, Japan","Ashikari, M (reprint author), Nagoya Univ, Biosci & Biotechnol Ctr, Nagoya, Aichi 4648601, Japan.",ashi@agr.nagoya-u.ac.jp,"Sakakibara, Hitoshi/A-6040-2010; U-ID, Kyushu/C-5291-2016","Sakakibara, Hitoshi/0000-0001-5449-6492; ","Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries of Japan [QT-2003, QT-4002]; Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (Y.

However, questions remain regarding the relative contributions of Arp2/3 complex versus other mechanisms of actin filament nucleation to processes such as path finding by neuronal growth cones; this is because of the lack of simple methods to inhibit Arp2/3 complex reversibly in living cells. Here we describe two classes of small molecules that bind to different sites on the Arp2/3 complex and inhibit its ability to nucleate actin filaments. CK-0944636 binds between Arp2 and Arp3, where it appears to block movement of Arp2 and Arp3 into their active conformation. CK-0993548 inserts into the hydrophobic core of Arp3 and alters its conformation. Both classes of compounds inhibit formation of actin filament comet tails by Listeria and podosomes by monocytes. Two inhibitors with different mechanisms of action provide a powerful approach for studying the Arp2/3 complex in living cells.","[Nolen, B. J.; Pollard, T.

Distinct cell types differ in the mechanisms by which the 'death receptor' FAS triggers their apoptosis(1-4). In type I cells, such as lymphocytes, activation of 'effector caspases' by FAS-induced activation of caspase-8 suffices for cell killing, whereas in type II cells, including hepatocytes and pancreatic beta-cells, caspase cascade amplification through caspase-8-mediated activation of the proapoptotic BCL-2 family member BID (BH3 interacting domain death agonist) 5 is essential(6-8). Here we show that loss of XIAP (X-chromosome linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein) 9,10 function by gene targeting or treatment with a second mitochondria-derived activator of caspases (SMAC(11,) also called DIABLO(12); direct IAP-binding protein with low pI) mimetic drug in mice rendered hepatocytes and beta-cells independent of BID for FAS-induced apoptosis. These results show that XIAP is the critical discriminator between type I and type II apoptosis signalling and suggest that IAP inhibitors should be used with caution in cancer patients with underlying liver conditions.","[Jost, Philipp J.; Grabow, Stephanie; Gray, Daniel; Huang, David C.

Many such organisms survive exposure to the harsh gastric environment (pH 1.5-4) by mounting extreme acid-resistance responses, one of which, the arginine-dependent system of Escherichia coli, has been studied at levels of cellular physiology, molecular genetics and protein biochemistry(1-7). This multiprotein system keeps the cytoplasm above pH 5 during acid challenge by continually pumping protons out of the cell using the free energy of arginine decarboxylation. At the heart of the process is a 'virtual proton pump' 8 in the inner membrane, called AdiC(3,4), that imports L-arginine from the gastric juice and exports its decarboxylation product agmatine. AdiC belongs to the APC superfamily of membrane proteins(6,7,9), which transports amino acids, polyamines and organic cations in a multitude of biological roles, including delivery of arginine for nitric oxide synthesis(10), facilitation of insulin release from pancreatic beta-cells(11), and, when inappropriately over-expressed, provisioning of certain fast-growing neoplastic cells with amino acids(12,13). High-resolution structures and detailed transport mechanisms of APC transporters are currently unknown. Here we describe a crystal structure of AdiC at 3.2 angstrom resolution. The protein is captured in an outward-open, substrate-free conformation with transmembrane architecture remarkably similar to that seen in four other families of apparently unrelated transport proteins.","[Fang, Yiling; Jayaram, Hariharan; Shane, Tania; Kolmakova-Partensky, Ludmila; Wu, Fang; Williams, Carole; Miller, Christopher] Brandeis Univ, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Dept Biochem, Waltham, MA 02454 USA; [Xiong, Yong] Yale Univ, Dept Mol Biophys & Biochem, New Haven, CT 06520 USA","Miller, C (reprint author), Brandeis Univ, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Dept Biochem, Waltham, MA 02454 USA.",cmiller@brandeis.edu,,,"NIH [T32 NS 07292]; Advanced Photon Source [GM-CAT, 23-ID]; Advanced Light Source [8.2.1, 8.2.2]; National Synchrotron Light Source [X-25, X-29A]","Y.

It remains unknown whether an open chromatin is necessary for the differentiation potential of stem cells, and which molecules are needed to maintain open chromatin. Here we show that the chromatin remodelling factor Chd1 is required to maintain the open chromatin of pluripotent mouse embryonic stem cells. Chd1 is a euchromatin protein that associates with the promoters of active genes, and downregulation of Chd1 leads to accumulation of heterochromatin. Chd1-deficient embryonic stem cells are no longer pluripotent, because they are incapable of giving rise to primitive endoderm and have a high propensity for neural differentiation. Furthermore, Chd1 is required for efficient reprogramming of fibroblasts to the pluripotent stem cell state. Our results indicate that Chd1 is essential for open chromatin and pluripotency of embryonic stem cells, and for somatic cell reprogramming to the pluripotent state.","[Gaspar-Maia, Alexandre; Polesso, Fanny; Ramalho-Santos, Miguel] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Ob Gyn, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; [Gaspar-Maia, Alexandre; Polesso, Fanny; Ramalho-Santos, Miguel] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Pathol, Ctr Reprod Sci, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; [Gaspar-Maia, Alexandre; Polesso, Fanny; Ramalho-Santos, Miguel] Univ Calif San Francisco, Eli & Edythe Broad Ctr Regenerat Med & Stem Cell, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; [Gaspar-Maia, Alexandre; Polesso, Fanny; Heidersbach, Amy; McManus, Michael T.; Ramalho-Santos, Miguel] Univ Calif San Francisco, Ctr Diabet, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; [Gaspar-Maia, Alexandre] Univ Coimbra, PhD Programme Biomed & Expt Biol, Ctr Neurosci & Cell Biol, P-3004517 Coimbra, Portugal; [Alajem, Adi; Meshorer, Eran] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Dept Genet, Inst Life Sci, IL-91904 Jerusalem, Israel; [Sridharan, Rupa; Mason, Mike J.; Plath, Kathrin] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Biol Chem, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Sridharan, Rupa; Mason, Mike J.; Plath, Kathrin] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Eli & Edythe Broad Ctr Regenerat Med & Stem Cell, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA","Ramalho-Santos, M (reprint author), Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Ob Gyn, 513 Parnassus Ave, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA.",mrsantos@diabetes.ucsf.edu,"Ramalho-Santos, Joao/F-8641-2012","Ramalho-Santos, Joao/0000-0002-1172-4018; Gaspar-Maia, Alexandre/0000-0001-8528-5575; McManus, Michael/0000-0003-3013-6569; Plath, Kathrin/0000-0001-7796-3372",Sandler Family; CIRM Young Investigator Award; NIH Director's New Innovator Award; Israel Science Foundation [ISF 215/07]; European Union [IRG-206872]; Alon Fellowship; California Institute for Regenerative Medicine; Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation,"The authors wish to thank A.

The near uniformity of their light curves makes these supernovae good `standard candles' for measuring cosmic expansion(1-4), but a correction must be applied to account for the fact that the brighter ones have broader light curves(5). One-dimensional modelling, with a certain choice of parameters, can reproduce this general trend in the width-luminosity relation(6-8); but the processes of ignition and detonation have recently been shown to be intrinsically asymmetric(9-13), so parameterization must have its limits. Here we report multi-dimensional modelling of the explosion physics and radiative transfer, which reveals that the breaking of spherical symmetry is a critical factor in determining both the width luminosity relation and the observed scatter about it. The deviation from spherical symmetry can also explain the finite polarization detected in the light from some supernovae(14). The slope and normalization of the width-luminosity relation has a weak dependence on certain properties of the white dwarf progenitor, in particular the trace abundances of elements other than carbon and oxygen. Failing to correct for this effect could lead to systematic overestimates of up to 2 per cent in the distance to remote supernovae.","[Kasen, D.; Woosley, S.

The presence of small-scale channels and dry riverbeds near the equator observed by the Huygens probe(9) at latitudes thought incapable of supporting convection(10-12) (and thus strong rain) has been suggested to be due to geological seepage or other mechanisms not related to precipitation(13). Here we report the presence of bright, transient, tropospheric clouds in tropical latitudes. We find that the initial pulse of cloud activity generated planetary waves that instigated cloud activity at other latitudes across Titan that had been cloud-free for at least several years. These observations show that convective pulses at one latitude can trigger short-term convection at other latitudes, even those not generally considered capable of supporting convection, and may also explain the presence of methane-carved rivers and channels near the Huygens landing site.","[Schaller, E.

Probing the symmetries and other mathematical properties of the densest packings is a problem of interest in discrete geometry and number theory(9-11). Previous work has focused mainly on spherical particles-very little is known about dense polyhedral packings. Here we formulate the generation of dense packings of polyhedra as an optimization problem, using an adaptive fundamental cell subject to periodic boundary conditions (we term this the 'adaptive shrinking cell' scheme). Using a variety of multi-particle initial configurations, we find the densest known packings of the four non-tiling Platonic solids (the tetrahedron, octahedron, dodecahedron and icosahedron) in three-dimensional Euclidean space. The densities are 0.782..., 0.947..., 0.904... and 0.836..., respectively. Unlike the densest tetrahedral packing, which must not be a Bravais lattice packing, the densest packings of the other non-tiling Platonic solids that we obtain are their previously known optimal (Bravais) lattice packings. Combining our simulation results with derived rigorous upper bounds and theoretical arguments leads us to the conjecture that the densest packings of the Platonic and Archimedean solids with central symmetry are given by their corresponding densest lattice packings. This is the analogue of Kepler's sphere conjecture for these solids.","[Torquato, S.] Princeton Univ, Dept Chem, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Torquato, S.] Princeton Univ, Princeton Ctr Theoret Sci, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Torquato, S.] Princeton Univ, Princeton Inst Sci & Technol Mat, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Torquato, S.; Jiao, Y.] Princeton Univ, Dept Mech & Aerosp Engn, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Torquato, S.] Inst Adv Study, Sch Nat Sci, Princeton, NJ 08540 USA","Torquato, S (reprint author), Princeton Univ, Dept Chem, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA.",torquato@princeton.edu,"Jiao, Yang/H-3823-2011",,"National Science Foundation [DMS-0804431, DMR-0820341]",We are grateful to H.

The short nature of the historical record and potential issues with its reliability in earlier decades, however, has prompted an ongoing debate regarding the reality and significance of the recent rise(2-5). Here we place recent activity in a longer-term context by comparing two independent estimates of tropical cyclone activity over the past 1,500 years. The first estimate is based on a composite of regional sedimentary evidence of landfalling hurricanes, while the second estimate uses a previously published statistical model of Atlantic tropical cyclone activity driven by proxy reconstructions of past climate changes. Both approaches yield consistent evidence of a peak in Atlantic tropical cyclone activity during medieval times (around AD 1000) followed by a subsequent lull in activity. The statistical model indicates that the medieval peak, which rivals or even exceeds (within uncertainties) recent levels of activity, results from the reinforcing effects of La-Nina-like climate conditions and relative tropical Atlantic warmth.","[Mann, Michael E.; Zhang, Zhihua] Penn State Univ, Dept Meteorol, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Mann, Michael E.; Zhang, Zhihua] Penn State Univ, Earth & Environm Syst Inst, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Woodruff, Jonathan D.] Univ Massachusetts, Dept Geosci, Amherst, MA 01003 USA; [Donnelly, Jeffrey P.] Woods Hole Oceanog Inst, Dept Geol & Geophys, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA","Mann, ME (reprint author), Penn State Univ, Dept Meteorol, 503 Walker Bldg, University Pk, PA 16802 USA.",mann@psu.edu,"Mann, Michael/B-8472-2017","Mann, Michael/0000-0003-3067-296X","National Science Foundation [ATM-0542356, EAR-0519118, OCE-0402746]","We thank C.

Tectonic deformation and surface denudation are interdependent, however, and feedback mechanisms-in particular, the potential link to climate-are subjects of intense debate(1,2). Spatial variations in fluvial denudation rate caused by precipitation gradients are known to provide first-order controls on mountain range width, crustal deformation rates and rock uplift(3,4). Moreover, limits to crustal strength(5) are thought to constrain the maximum elevation of large continental plateaus, such as those in Tibet and the central Andes. There are indications that the general height of mountain ranges is also directly influenced by the extent of glaciation through an efficient denudation mechanism known as the glacial buzzsaw(6-9). Here we use a global analysis of topography and show that variations in maximum mountain height correlate closely with climate-controlled gradients in snowline altitude for many high mountain ranges across orogenic ages and tectonic styles. With the aid of a numerical model, we further demonstrate how a combination of erosional destruction of topography above the snowline by glacier-sliding and commensurate isostatic landscape uplift caused by erosional unloading can explain observations of maximum mountain height by driving elevations towards an altitude window just below the snowline. The model thereby self-consistently produces the hypsometric signature of the glacial buzzsaw, and suggests that differences in the height of mountain ranges mainly reflect variations in local climate rather than tectonic forces.","[Egholm, D.

Here we report the discovery of a completely ossified pelvic clasper in Incisoscutum ritchiei (WAM 03.3.28) which shows that this interpretation was incorrect: the basipterygium described previously(1) is in fact unique to females. The male clasper is a slender rod attached to a square basal plate that articulates directly with the pelvis.

Until recently, C. albicans was thought to be strictly asexual, existing only as an obligate diploid. A cryptic mating cycle has since been uncovered in which diploid a and alpha cells undergo efficient cell and nuclear fusion, resulting in tetraploid a/alpha mating products(3-6). Whereas mating between a and alpha cells has been established (heterothallism), we report here two pathways for same-sex mating (homothallism) in C. albicans. First, unisexual populations of a cells were found to undergo autocrine pheromone signalling and same-sex mating in the absence of the Bar1 protease. In both C. albicans and Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Bar1 is produced by a cells and inactivates mating pheromone alpha, typically secreted by alpha cells(7-10). C. albicans Delta bar1 a cells were shown to secrete both a and alpha mating pheromones; alpha-pheromone activated self-mating in these cells in a process dependent on Ste2, the receptor for alpha-pheromone. In addition, pheromone production by alpha cells was found to promote same-sex mating between wild-type a cells. These results establish that homothallic mating can occur in C. albicans, revealing the potential for genetic exchange even within unisexual populations of the organism. Furthermore, Bar1 protease has an unexpected but pivotal role in determining whether sexual reproduction can potentially be homothallic or is exclusively heterothallic. These findings also have implications for the mode of sexual reproduction in related species that propagate unisexually, and indicate a role for specialized sexual cycles in the survival and adaptation of pathogenic fungi.","[Alby, Kevin; Schaefer, Dana; Bennett, Richard J.] Brown Univ, Dept Mol Microbiol & Immunol, Providence, RI 02912 USA","Bennett, RJ (reprint author), Brown Univ, Dept Mol Microbiol & Immunol, Providence, RI 02912 USA.",Richard_Bennett@brown.edu,,"Bennett, Richard/0000-0001-7563-484X",Burroughs Wellcome Fund,"The authors would like to thank D.

However, genomic diversity is difficult to generate in the laboratory and new phenotypes do not easily arise on practical timescales(3). Although in vitro and directed evolution methods(4-9) have created genetic variants with usefully altered phenotypes, these methods are limited to laborious and serial manipulation of single genes and are not used for parallel and continuous directed evolution of gene networks or genomes. Here, we describe multiplex automated genome engineering (MAGE) for large-scale programming and evolution of cells. MAGE simultaneously targets many locations on the chromosome for modification in a single cell or across a population of cells, thus producing combinatorial genomic diversity. Because the process is cyclical and scalable, we constructed prototype devices that automate the MAGE technology to facilitate rapid and continuous generation of a diverse set of genetic changes (mismatches, insertions, deletions). We applied MAGE to optimize the 1-deoxy-D-xylulose-5-phosphate (DXP) biosynthesis pathway in Escherichia coli to overproduce the industrially important isoprenoid lycopene. Twenty-four genetic components in the DXP pathway were modified simultaneously using a complex pool of synthetic DNA, creating over 4.3 billion combinatorial genomic variants per day. We isolated variants with more than fivefold increase in lycopene production within 3 days, a significant improvement over existing metabolic engineering techniques. Our multiplex approach embraces engineering in the context of evolution by expediting the design and evolution of organisms with new and improved properties.","[Wang, Harris H.; Isaacs, Farren J.; Church, George M.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Genet, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Wang, Harris H.] Harvard Univ, Program Biophys, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Wang, Harris H.] MIT, Harvard Mit Div Hlth Sci & Technol, Program Med Engn Med Phys, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Carr, Peter A.] MIT, Ctr Bits & Atoms, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Carr, Peter A.] MIT, Media Lab, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Sun, Zachary Z.; Xu, George] Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Forest, Craig R.] Georgia Inst Technol, George W Woodruff Sch Mech Engn, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA","Wang, HH (reprint author), Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Genet, Boston, MA 02115 USA.",hhwang@genetics.med.harvard.edu; farren@alumni.upenn.edu,,"church, george/0000-0001-6232-9969",NSF; DOE; DARPA; Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering; NIH; NDSEG,"We are grateful to J.

Intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells use melanopsin(3) as the photopigment, and mediate non-image-forming visual functions such as circadian photoentrainment. In fish, in situ hybridization studies indicated that melanopsin is present in retinal horizontal cells(4-6)-lateral association neurons critical for creating the centre-surround receptive fields of visual neurons. This raises the question of whether fish horizontal cells are intrinsically photosensitive. This notion was examined previously in flat-mount roach retina, but all horizontal-cell light response disappeared after synaptic transmission was blocked(6), making any conclusion difficult to reach. To examine this question directly, we have now recorded from single, acutely dissociated horizontal cells from catfish and goldfish. We found that light induced a response in catfish cone horizontal cells, but not rod horizontal cells, consisting of a modulation of the nifedipine-sensitive, voltage-gated calcium current. The light response was extremely slow, lasting for many minutes. Similar light responses were observed in a high percentage of goldfish horizontal cells. We have cloned two melanopsin genes and one vertebrate ancient (VA) opsin gene from catfish. In situ hybridization indicated that melanopsin, but less likely VA opsin, was expressed in the horizontal-cell layer of catfish retina. This intrinsic light response may serve to modulate, over a long time-scale, lateral inhibition mediated by these cells. Thus, at least in some vertebrates, there are retinal non-rod/non-cone photoreceptors involved primarily in image-forming vision.","[Cheng, Ning; Tsunenari, Takashi; Yau, King-Wai] Johns Hopkins Univ, Sch Med, Solomon H Snyder Dept Neurosci, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA; [Cheng, Ning; Tsunenari, Takashi; Yau, King-Wai] Johns Hopkins Univ, Sch Med, Ctr Sensory Biol, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA; [Yau, King-Wai] Johns Hopkins Univ, Sch Med, Dept Ophthalmol, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA","Cheng, N (reprint author), NINDS, Unit Dev Neural Plast, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA.",chengn2@mail.nih.gov; kwyau@mail.jhmi.edu,,,NIH; Antonio Champalimaud Vision Award (Portugal),"This work was supported by an NIH grant and the Antonio Champalimaud Vision Award (Portugal) to K.-W.

Here we show unique gain-of-function mutations of the C-CBL (also known as CBL) tumour suppressor that are tightly associated with aUPD of the 11q arm in myeloid neoplasms showing myeloproliferative features. The C-CBL proto-oncogene, a cellular homologue of v-Cbl, encodes an E3 ubiquitin ligase and negatively regulates signal transduction of tyrosine kinases(3-6). Homozygous C-CBL mutations were found in most 11q-aUPD-positive myeloid malignancies. Although the C-CBL mutations were oncogenic in NIH3T3 cells, c-Cbl was shown to functionally and genetically act as a tumour suppressor. C-CBL mutants did not have E3 ubiquitin ligase activity, but inhibited that of wild-type C-CBL and CBL-B (also known as CBLB), leading to prolonged activation of tyrosine kinases after cytokine stimulation. c-Cbl(-/-) haematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs) showed enhanced sensitivity to a variety of cytokines compared to c-Cbl(+/+) HSPCs, and transduction of C-CBL mutants into c-Cbl(-/-) HSPCs further augmented their sensitivities to a broader spectrum of cytokines, including stem-cell factor (SCF, also known as KITLG), thrombopoietin (TPO, also known as THPO), IL3 and FLT3 ligand (FLT3LG), indicating the presence of a gain-of-function that could not be attributed to a simple loss-of-function. The gain-of-function effects of C-CBL mutants on cytokine sensitivity of HSPCs largely disappeared in a c-Cbl(-/-) background or by co-transduction of wild-type C-CBL, which suggests the pathogenic importance of loss of wild-type C-CBL alleles found in most cases of C-CBL-mutated myeloid neoplasms. Our findings provide a new insight into a role of gain-of-function mutations of a tumour suppressor associated with aUPD in the pathogenesis of some myeloid cancer subsets.","[Sanada, Masashi; Kato, Motohiro; Tamura, Azusa; Takita, Junko; Nakazaki, Kumi; Ogawa, Seishi] Univ Tokyo, Canc Genom Project, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo 1138655, Japan; [Kato, Motohiro; Takita, Junko] Univ Tokyo, Dept Pediat, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo 1138655, Japan; [Kumano, Keiki; Takita, Junko; Nakazaki, Kumi; Kurokawa, Mineo; Hirai, Hisamaru] Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Med, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo 1138655, Japan; [Sanada, Masashi; Yamazaki, Satoshi; Nakauchi, Hiromitsu; Ogawa, Seishi] Japan Sci & Technol Agcy, Kawaguchi, Saitama 3320012, Japan; [Suzuki, Takahiro; Nobuyoshi, Masaharu; Ozawa, Keiya] Jichi Med Univ, Dept Med, Div Hematol, Shimotsuke, Tochigi 3290498, Japan; [Shih, Lee-Yung] Chang Gung Univ, Chang Gung Mem Hosp, Dept Internal Med, Div Hematol Oncol, Taipei 105, Taiwan; [Otsu, Makoto; Nakauchi, Hiromitsu] Univ Tokyo, Div Stem Cell Therapy, Ctr Stem Cell & Regenerat Med, Minato Ku, Tokyo 1088639, Japan; [Gotoh, Noriko] Univ Tokyo, Div Syst Biomed Technol, Inst Med Sci, Minato Ku, Tokyo 1088639, Japan; [Honda, Hiroaki] Hiroshima Univ, Res Inst Radiat Biol & Med, Dept Dev Biol, Minami Ku, Hiroshima 7348553, Japan; [Sakata-Yanagimoto, Mamiko; Chiba, Shigeru] Univ Tsukuba, Inst Clin Med, Dept Clin & Expt Hematol, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058571, Japan; [Oda, Hideaki] Tokyo Womens Med Univ, Dept Pathol, Shinjuku Ku, Tokyo 1628666, Japan; [Yamagata, Tetsuya] Dokkyo Univ, Sch Med, Dept Hematol, Mibu, Tochigi 3210293, Japan; [Kawamata, Norihiko; Koeffler, H.

Here we differentiate mouse embryonic stem cells carrying a stella transgenic reporter into putative PGCs in vitro. The Stella(+) cells possess a transcriptional profile similar to embryo-derived PGCs, and like their counterparts in vivo, lose imprints in a time-dependent manner. Using inhibitory RNAs to screen candidate genes for effects on the development of Stella(+) cells in vitro, we discovered that Lin28, a negative regulator of let-7 microRNA processing(3-6), is essential for proper PGC development. Furthermore, we show that Blimp1 (also called Prdm1), a let-7 target and a master regulator of PGCspecification(7-9), can rescue the effect of Lin28 deficiency during PGC development, thereby establishing a mechanism of action for Lin28 during PGC specification. Overexpression of Lin28 promotes formation of Stella(+) cells in vitro and PGCs in chimaeric embryos, and is associated with human germ-cell tumours. The differentiation of putative PGCs from embryonic stem cells in vitro recapitulates the early stages of gamete development in vivo, and provides an accessible system for discovering novel genes involved in germ-cell development and malignancy.","[West, Jason A.; Viswanathan, Srinivas R.; Yabuuchi, Akiko; Cunniff, Kerianne; Takeuchi, Ayumu; Park, In-Hyun; Zhu, Hao; Frazier, A.

Telomere deprotection activates both ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) and telangiectasia and Rad3-related (ATR) kinase-dependent DNA damage response pathways, and promotes efficient non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) of dysfunctional telomeres(2-5). The mammalian MRE11-RAD50-NBS1 (MRN; NBS1 is also known as NBN) complex interacts with ATM to sense chromosomal double-strand breaks and coordinate global DNA damage responses(6,7). Although the MRN complex accumulates at dysfunctional telomeres, it is not known whether mammalian MRN promotes repair at these sites. Here we address this question by using mouse alleles that either inactivate the entire MRN complex or eliminate only the nuclease activities of MRE11 (ref. 8). We show that cells lacking MRN do not activate ATM when telomeric repeat binding factor 2 (TRF2) is removed from telomeres, and ligase 4 (LIG4)-dependent chromosome end-to-end fusions are markedly reduced. Residual chromatid fusions involve only telomeres generated by leading strand synthesis. Notably, although cells deficient for MRE11 nuclease activity efficiently activate ATM and recruit 53BP1 (also known as TP53BP1) to deprotected telomeres, the 3' telomeric overhang persists to prevent NHEJ-mediated chromosomal fusions. Removal of shelterin proteins that protect the 3' overhang in the setting of MRE11 nuclease deficiency restores LIG4-dependent chromosome fusions. Our data indicate a critical role for the MRN complex in sensing dysfunctional telomeres, and show that in the absence of TRF2, MRE11 nuclease activity removes the 3' telomeric overhang to promote chromosome fusions. MRE11 can also protect newly replicated leading strand telomeres from NHEJ by promoting 5' strand resection to generate POT1a-TPP1-bound 3' overhangs.","[Deng, Yibin; Guo, Xiaolan; Chang, Sandy] Univ Texas MD Anderson Canc Ctr, Dept Genet, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Chang, Sandy] Univ Texas MD Anderson Canc Ctr, Dept Hematopathol, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Guo, Xiaolan] N Sichuan Med Coll, Inst Rheumatol & Immunol, Nanchong 637000, Sichuan, Peoples R China; [Ferguson, David O.] Univ Michigan, Sch Med, Dept Pathol, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA","Chang, S (reprint author), Univ Texas MD Anderson Canc Ctr, Dept Genet, Box 1010,1515 Holcombe Blvd, Houston, TX 77030 USA.",schang@mdanderson.org,,,National Institute on Aging (NIA) [RO1 AG028888]; National Cancer Institute (NCI) [RO1 CA129037]; Welch Foundation; Susan G.

Furthermore, miR-145 and miR-143 cooperatively targeted a network of transcription factors, including Klf4 (Kruppel-like factor 4), myocardin and Elk-1 (ELK1, member of ETS oncogene family), to promote differentiation and repress proliferation of smooth muscle cells.

Viral replication is regulated at many levels, including the use of conserved genomic RNA structures. Most potential regulatory elements in viral RNA genomes are uncharacterized. Here we report the structure of an entire HIV-1 genome at single nucleotide resolution using SHAPE, a high-throughput RNA analysis technology. The genome encodes protein structure at two levels. In addition to the correspondence between RNA and protein primary sequences, a correlation exists between high levels of RNA structure and sequences that encode inter-domain loops in HIV proteins. This correlation suggests that RNA structure modulates ribosome elongation to promote native protein folding. Some simple genome elements previously shown to be important, including the ribosomal gag-pol frameshift stem-loop, are components of larger RNA motifs. We also identify organizational principles for unstructured RNA regions, including splice site acceptors and hypervariable regions.

This finding has attracted considerable attention(8-13), as it suggests that massive galaxies have grown in size by a factor of about five over the past ten billion years (10 Gyr). A key test of these results is a determination of the stellar kinematics of one of the compact galaxies: if the sizes of these objects are as extreme as has been claimed, their stars are expected to have much higher velocities than those in present-day galaxies of the same mass. Here we report a measurement of the stellar velocity dispersion of a massive compact galaxy at redshift z = 2.186, corresponding to a look-back time of 10.7 Gyr. The velocity dispersion is very high at 510(-95)(+165) km s(-1), consistent with the mass and compactness of the galaxy inferred from photometric data. This would indicate significant recent structural and dynamical evolution of massive galaxies over the past 10 Gyr. The uncertainty in the dispersion was determined from simulations that include the effects of noise and template mismatch. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that some subtle systematic effect may have influenced the analysis, given the low signal-to-noise ratio of our spectrum.","[van Dokkum, Pieter G.] Yale Univ, Dept Astron, New Haven, CT 06511 USA; [Kriek, Mariska] Princeton Univ, Dept Astrophys Sci, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Franx, Marijn] Leiden Univ, Leiden Observ, NL-2300 RA Leiden, Netherlands","van Dokkum, PG (reprint author), Yale Univ, Dept Astron, 260 Whitney Ave, New Haven, CT 06511 USA.",pieter.vandokkum@yale.edu,,,NASA; NSF,"This Letter is based on observations obtained at the Gemini Observatory and with the HST.

An intriguing aspect of the recent observations of methane on Mars is that methane concentrations appear to be locally enhanced and change with the seasons(3). However, methane has a photochemical lifetime of several centuries, and is therefore expected to have a spatially uniform distribution on the planet(5). Here we use a global climate model of Mars with coupled chemistry(6-8) to examine the implications of the recently observed variations of Martian methane for our understanding of the chemistry of methane. We find that photochemistry as currently understood does not produce measurable variations in methane concentrations, even in the case of a current, local and episodic methane release. In contrast, we find that the condensation-sublimation cycle of Mars' carbon dioxide atmosphere can generate large-scale methane variations differing from those observed. In order to reproduce local methane enhancements similar to those recently reported(3), we show that an atmospheric lifetime of less than 200 days is necessary, even if a local source of methane is only active around the time of the observation itself. This implies an unidentified methane loss process that is 600 times faster than predicted by standard photochemistry. The existence of such a fast loss in the Martian atmosphere is difficult to reconcile with the observed distribution of other trace gas species. In the case of a destruction mechanism only active at the surface of Mars, destruction of methane must occur with an even shorter timescale of the order of similar to 1 hour to explain the observations. If recent observations of spatial and temporal variations of methane are confirmed, this would suggest an extraordinarily harsh environment for the survival of organics on the planet.","[Lefevre, Franck] Univ Paris 06, CNRS, LATMOS, F-75005 Paris, France; [Forget, Francois] Univ Paris 06, CNRS, Meteorol Dynam Lab, F-75005 Paris, France","Lefevre, F (reprint author), Univ Paris 06, CNRS, LATMOS, F-75005 Paris, France.",franck.lefevre@upmc.fr,,,CNRS; ESA; CNES,"The LMD Martian global climate model has been developed with the support of CNRS, ESA and CNES.

Nano-and micromechanical devices can be coupled to a variety of systems, for example to single electrons by electrostatic(1,2) or magnetic coupling(3,4), and to photons by radiation pressure(5-9) or optical dipole forces(10,11). So far, all such experiments have operated in a regime of weak coupling, in which reversible energy exchange between the mechanical device and its coupled partner is suppressed by fast decoherence of the individual systems to their local environments. Controlled quantum experiments are in principle not possible in such a regime, but instead require strong coupling. So far, this has been demonstrated only between microscopic quantum systems, such as atoms and photons (in the context of cavity quantum electrodynamics(12)) or solid state qubits and photons(13,14). Strong coupling is an essential requirement for the preparation of mechanical quantum states, such as squeezed or entangled states(15-18), and also for using mechanical resonators in the context of quantum information processing, for example, as quantum transducers. Here we report the observation of optomechanical normal mode splitting(19,20), which provides unambiguous evidence for strong coupling of cavity photons to a mechanical resonator.

(13)C/(12)C can temporarily rise when large amounts of (13)C-depleted photosynthetic organic matter are buried at enhanced rates(1), and can decrease if phytomass is rapidly oxidized(2) or if low (13)C is rapidly released from methane clathrates(3). Assuming that variations of the marine (13)C/(12)C ratio are directly recorded in carbonate rocks, thousands of carbon isotope analyses of late Precambrian examples have been published to correlate these otherwise undatable strata and to document perturbations to the carbon cycle just before the great expansion of metazoan life. Low (13)C/(12)C in some Neoproterozoic carbonates is considered evidence of carbon cycle perturbations unique to the Precambrian. These include complete oxidation of all organic matter in the ocean(2) and complete productivity collapse such that low-(13)C/(12)C hydrothermal CO(2) becomes the main input of carbon(4). Here we compile all published oxygen and carbon isotope data for Neoproterozoic marine carbonates, and consider them in terms of processes known to alter the isotopic composition during transformation of the initial precipitate into limestone/dolostone. We show that the combined oxygen and carbon isotope systematics are identical to those of well-understood Phanerozoic examples that lithified in coastal pore fluids, receiving a large groundwater influx of photosynthetic carbon from terrestrial phytomass. Rather than being perturbations to the carbon cycle, widely reported decreases in (13)C/(12)C in Neoproterozoic carbonates are more easily interpreted in the same way as is done for Phanerozoic examples. This influx of terrestrial carbon is not apparent in carbonates older than similar to 850 Myr, so we infer an explosion of photosynthesizing communities on late Precambrian land surfaces. As a result, biotically enhanced weathering generated carbon-bearing soils on a large scale and their detrital sedimentation sequestered carbon(5). This facilitated a rise in O(2) necessary for the expansion of multicellular life.","[Knauth, L.

The transpressional subduction regime of New Zealand, which is advancing laterally to the southwest below the Marlborough strike-slip fault system of the northern South Island(3,4), is an ideal setting in which to investigate these processes. Here we acquired a dense, high-quality transect of magnetotelluric soundings across the system, yielding an electrical resistivity cross-section to depths beyond 100 km. Our data imply three distinct processes connecting fluid generation along the upper mantle plate interface to rock deformation in the crust as the subduction zone develops. Massive fluid release just inland of the trench induces fault-fracture meshes through the crust above that undoubtedly weaken it as regional shear initiates. Narrow strike-slip faults in the shallow brittle regime of interior Marlborough diffuse in width upon entering the deeper ductile domain aided by fluids and do not project as narrow deformation zones. Deep subduction-generated fluids rise from 100 km or more and invade upper crustal seismogenic zones that have exhibited historic great earthquakes on high-angle thrusts that are poorly oriented for failure under dry conditions. The fluid-deformation connections described in our work emphasize the need to include metamorphic and fluid transport processes in geodynamic models.","[Wannamaker, Philip E.] Univ Utah, Energy & Geosci Inst, Salt Lake City, UT 84108 USA; [Caldwell, T.

The negative association of fertility with economic and social development has therefore become one of the most solidly established and generally accepted empirical regularities in the social sciences(1-3). As a result of this close connection between development and fertility decline, more than half of the global population now lives in regions with below-replacement fertility (less than 2.1 children per woman)(4). In many highly developed countries, the trend towards low fertility has also been deemed irreversible(5-9). Rapid population ageing, and in some cases the prospect of significant population decline, have therefore become a central socioeconomic concern and policy challenge(10). Here we show, using new cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses of the total fertility rate and the human development index (HDI), a fundamental change in the well-established negative relationship between fertility and development as the global population entered the twenty-first century. Although development continues to promote fertility decline at low and medium HDI levels, our analyses show that at advanced HDI levels, further development can reverse the declining trend in fertility. The previously negative development-fertility relationship has become J-shaped, with the HDI being positively associated with fertility among highly developed countries. This reversal of fertility decline as a result of continued economic and social development has the potential to slow the rates of population ageing, thereby ameliorating the social and economic problems that have been associated with the emergence and persistence of very low fertility.","[Myrskylae, Mikko; Kohler, Hans-Peter] Univ Penn, Ctr Populat Studies, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Billari, Francesco C.] Univ Bocconi, DONDENA Carlo F Dondena Ctr Res Social Dynam, Dept Decis Sci, I-20136 Milan, Italy; [Billari, Francesco C.] Univ Bocconi, IGIER, I-20136 Milan, Italy","Kohler, HP (reprint author), Univ Penn, Ctr Populat Studies, 3718 Locust Walk, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",hpkohler@pop.upenn.edu,,"Billari, Francesco C./0000-0003-4717-6129",University of Pennsylvania; Finnish Cultural Foundation; Ella and Georg Ehrnrooth foundation; Center for Advanced Studies at the Norwegian Academy of Science; Universita Bocconi; Italian Ministry for University and Research,"M.

Research on pathogenesis has traditionally focused on neurotransmitter systems in the brain, particularly those involving dopamine. Schizophrenia has been considered a separate disease for over a century, but in the absence of clear biological markers, diagnosis has historically been based on signs and symptoms. A fundamental message emerging from genome-wide association studies of copy number variations (CNVs) associated with the disease is that its genetic basis does not necessarily conform to classical nosological disease boundaries. Certain CNVs confer not only high relative risk of schizophrenia but also of other psychiatric disorders(1-3). The structural variations associated with schizophrenia can involve several genes and the phenotypic syndromes, or the 'genomic disorders', have not yet been characterized(4). Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-based genome-wide association studies with the potential to implicate individual genes in complex diseases may reveal underlying biological pathways. Here we combined SNP data from several large genome-wide scans and followed up the most significant association signals. We found significant association with several markers spanning the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) region on chromosome 6p21.3-22.1, a marker located upstream of the neurogranin gene (NRGN) on 11q24.2 and a marker in intron four of transcription factor 4 (TCF4) on 18q21.2. Our findings implicating the MHC region are consistent with an immune component to schizophrenia risk, whereas the association with NRGN and TCF4 points to perturbation of pathways involved in brain development, memory and cognition.","[Stefansson, Hreinn; Steinberg, Stacy; Gustafsson, Omar; Ingason, Andres; Bottcher, Yvonne; Olason, Pall; Mason, Gisli; Gulcher, Jeffrey R.; Fossdal, Ragnheidur; Thorgeirsson, Thorgeir E.; Thorsteinsdottir, Unnur; Kong, Augustine; Stefansson, Kari] DeCODE Genet, IS-101 Reykjavik, Iceland; [Ophoff, Roel A.; Strengman, Eric] Univ Med Ctr Utrecht, Dept Med Genet, NL-3584 CG Utrecht, Netherlands; [Ophoff, Roel A.; Strengman, Eric] Univ Med Ctr Utrecht, Rudolf Magnus Inst Neurosci, NL-3584 CG Utrecht, Netherlands; [Ophoff, Roel A.; Freimer, Nelson B.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Ctr Neurobehav Genet, Los Angeles, CA 90024 USA; [Andreassen, Ole A.; Melle, Ingrid] Ullevaal Univ Hosp, Dept Psychiat, N-0407 Oslo, Norway; [Andreassen, Ole A.; Melle, Ingrid] Univ Oslo, Inst Psychiat, N-0407 Oslo, Norway; [Cichon, Sven; Mattheisen, Manuel] Univ Bonn, Life & Brain Ctr, Dept Genom, D-53127 Bonn, Germany; [Rujescu, Dan; Hartmann, Annette; Giegling, Ina] Univ Munich, Dept Psychiat, Div Mol & Clin Neurobiol, D-80336 Munich, Germany; [Werge, Thomas; Hansen, Thomas; Rasmussen, Henrik B.] Univ Copenhagen, Mental Hlth Ctr Sct Hans, Res Inst Biol Psychiat, DK-4000 Roskilde, Denmark; [Pietilainen, Olli P.

We performed a genome-wide association study of 3,322 European individuals with schizophrenia and 3,587 controls. Here we show, using two analytic approaches, the extent to which common genetic variation underlies the risk of schizophrenia. First, we implicate the major histocompatibility complex. Second, we provide molecular genetic evidence for a substantial polygenic component to the risk of schizophrenia involving thousands of common alleles of very small effect. We show that this component also contributes to the risk of bipolar disorder, but not to several non-psychiatric diseases.","[Purcell, Shaun M.; Stone, Jennifer L.; Sklar, Pamela; Ruderfer, Douglas M.; Ferreira, Manuel A.

Recent studies implicate rare, large, high-penetrance copy number variants in some cases(2), but the genes or biological mechanisms that underlie susceptibility are not known. Here we show that schizophrenia is significantly associated with single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the extended major histocompatibility complex region on chromosome 6. We carried out a genome-wide association study of common SNPs in the Molecular Genetics of Schizophrenia (MGS) case-control sample, and then a meta-analysis of data from the MGS, International Schizophrenia Consortium and SGENE data sets. No MGS finding achieved genome-wide statistical significance. In the meta-analysis of European-ancestry subjects (8,008 cases, 19,077 controls), significant association with schizophrenia was observed in a region of linkage disequilibrium on chromosome 6p22.1 (P = 9.54 x 10(-9)). This region includes a histone gene cluster and several immunity-related genes-possibly implicating aetiological mechanisms involving chromatin modification, transcriptional regulation, autoimmunity and/or infection. These results demonstrate that common schizophrenia susceptibility alleles can be detected. The characterization of these signals will suggest important directions for research on susceptibility mechanisms.","[Duan, Jubao; Sanders, Alan R.; Zheng, Yonglan; Gejman, Pablo V.] NorthShore Univ HealthSyst, Res Inst, Ctr Psychiat Genet, Evanston, IL 60201 USA; [Shi, Jianxin; Levinson, Douglas F.] Stanford Univ, Dept Psychiat & Behav Sci, Stanford, CA 94304 USA; [Pe'er, Itsik] Columbia Univ, Dept Comp Sci, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Dudbridge, Frank] MRC, Biostat Unit, Inst Publ Hlth, Cambridge CB2 2SR, England; [Holmans, Peter A.] MRC, Ctr Neuropsychiat Genet & Genom, Dept Psychol Med & Neurol, Sch Med, Cardiff CF23 6BQ, Wales; [Whittemore, Alice S.] Stanford Univ, Dept Hlth Res & Policy, Stanford, CA 94304 USA; [Mowry, Bryan J.] Queensland Ctr Mental Hlth Res, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia; [Mowry, Bryan J.] Queensland Inst Med Res, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia; [Olincy, Ann; Freedman, Robert] Univ Colorado Denver, Dept Psychiat, Aurora, CO 80045 USA; [Amin, Farooq] Atlanta Vet Affairs Med Ctr, Dept Psychiat & Behav Sci, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA; [Amin, Farooq] Emory Univ, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA; [Cloninger, C.

Glial cells generally migrate over long distances before they initiate their differentiation, which leads to wrapping and insulation of axonal processes(1,2). The molecular pathways coordinating the switch from glial migration to glial differentiation are largely unknown(3). Here we demonstrate that, within the Drosophila eye imaginal disc, fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signalling coordinates glial proliferation, migration and subsequent axonal wrapping. Glial differentiation in the Drosophila eye disc requires a succession from glia-glia interaction to glia-neuron interaction(4). The neuronal component of the fly eye develops in the peripheral nervous system within the eye-antennal imaginal disc, whereas glial cells originate from a pool of central-nervous-system-derived progenitors and migrate onto the eye imaginal disc(5-8). Initially, glial-derived Pyramus, an FGF8-like ligand, modulates glial cell number and motility. A switch to neuronally expressed Thisbe, a second FGF8-like ligand, then induces glial differentiation. This switch is accompanied by an alteration in the intracellular signalling pathway through which the FGF receptor channels information into the cell. Our findings reveal how a switch from glia-glia interactions to glia-neuron interactions can trigger formation of glial membrane around axonal trajectories. These results disclose an evolutionarily conserved control mechanism of axonal wrapping(2), indicating that Drosophila might serve as a model to understand glial disorders in humans.","[Franzdottir, Sigridur Rut; Engelen, Daniel; Yuva-Aydemir, Yeliz; Schmidt, Imke; Aho, Annukka; Klaembt, Christian] Univ Munster, Inst Neurobiol, D-48149 Munster, Germany","Klambt, C (reprint author), Univ Munster, Inst Neurobiol, Badestr 9, D-48149 Munster, Germany.",klaembt@uni-muenster.de,"Franzdottir, Sigridur/M-2534-2015",,Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft,"We thank A.

However, important research directions, particularly those involving mathematical modelling and simulation of biological processes, also critically depend on absolutely quantitative data-that is, knowledge of the concentration of the expressed proteins as a function of cellular state. Until now, absolute protein concentration measurements of a considerable fraction of the proteome (73%) have only been derived from genetically altered Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells(1), a technique that is not directly portable from yeast to other species. Here we present a mass-spectrometry-based strategy to determine the absolute quantity, that is, the average number of protein copies per cell in a cell population, for a large fraction of the proteome in genetically unperturbed cells. Applying the technology to the human pathogen Leptospira interrogans, a spirochete responsible for leptospirosis(2), we generated an absolute protein abundance scale for 83% of the mass-spectrometry-detectable proteome, from cells at different states. Taking advantage of the unique cellular dimensions of L. interrogans, we used cryo-electron tomography morphological measurements to verify, at the single-cell level, the average absolute abundance values of selected proteins determined by mass spectrometry on a population of cells. Because the strategy is relatively fast and applicable to any cell type, we expect that it will become a cornerstone of quantitative biology and systems biology.","[Malmstroem, Johan; Beck, Martin; Schmidt, Alexander; Lange, Vinzenz; Aebersold, Ruedi] ETH, Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Inst Mol Syst Biol, CH-8093 Zurich, Switzerland; [Schmidt, Alexander; Lange, Vinzenz; Aebersold, Ruedi] Competence Ctr Syst Physiol & Metab Dis, CH-8093 Zurich, Switzerland; [Deutsch, Eric W.; Aebersold, Ruedi] Inst Syst Biol, Seattle, WA 98103 USA; [Aebersold, Ruedi] Univ Zurich, Fac Sci, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland","Aebersold, R (reprint author), ETH, Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Inst Mol Syst Biol, Wolfgang Pauli Str 16, CH-8093 Zurich, Switzerland.",aebersold@imsb.biol.ethz.ch,"Malmstrom, Johan/B-7660-2009; Schmidt, Alexander/C-5122-2009; Beck, Martin/B-5589-2011; Schmidt, Alexander/D-6426-2011","Malmstrom, Johan/0000-0002-2889-7169; Beck, Martin/0000-0002-7397-1321; Lange, Vinzenz/0000-0002-6442-9573; Deutsch, Eric/0000-0001-8732-0928","ETH Zurich; Swiss National Science Foundation [31000-10767]; National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute; National Institutes of Health [N01-HV-28179]; ERC; Swedish Society for Medical Research; European Molecular Biology Organization; Marie Curie fellowship of the European Commission; Competence Center for Systems Physiology and Metabolic Diseases","This project has been funded in part by ETH Zurich, the Swiss National Science Foundation (grant 31000-10767), federal funds from the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, the National Institutes of Health (contract no.

Because P2X receptors are not related to other ion channel proteins of known structure, there is at present no molecular foundation for mechanisms of ligand-gating, allosteric modulation and ion permeation. Here we present crystal structures of the zebrafish P2X(4) receptor in its closed, resting state. The chalice-shaped, trimeric receptor is knit together by subunit-subunit contacts implicated in ion channel gating and receptor assembly. Extracellular domains, rich in beta-strands, have large acidic patches that may attract cations, through fenestrations, to vestibules near the ion channel. In the transmembrane pore, the 'gate' is defined by an similar to 8 angstrom slab of protein.

Dwarf spheroidals are poor in gas and stars, making them unusually faint(4-6), and those known as ultra-faint dwarfs(7,8) have by far the lowest measured stellar content of any galaxy(9,10). Previous theories(11) require that dwarf spheroidals orbit near giant galaxies like the Milky Way, but some dwarfs have been observed in the outskirts of the Local Group(12). Here we report simulations of encounters between dwarf disk galaxies and somewhat larger objects. We find that the encounters excite a process, which we term 'resonant stripping', that transforms them into dwarf spheroidals. This effect is distinct from other mechanisms proposed to form dwarf spheroidals, including mergers(13), galaxy galaxy harassment(14), or tidal and ram pressure stripping, because it is driven by gravitational resonances. It may account for some of the observed properties of dwarf spheroidals in the Local Group. Within this framework, dwarf spheroidals should form and interact in pairs, leaving detectable long stellar streams and tails.","[D'Onghia, Elena] Univ Zurich, Inst Theoret Phys, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland; [D'Onghia, Elena; Besla, Gurtina; Cox, Thomas J.; Hernquist, Lars] Harvard Smithsonian Ctr Astrophys, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA","D'Onghia, E (reprint author), Univ Zurich, Inst Theoret Phys, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland.",edonghia@cfa.harvard.edu,,,EU [MEIF-041569]; NSERC,This research was partly supported by an EU Marie Curie Intra-European Fellowship under contract MEIF-041569 and by an NSERC postgraduate fellowship.

Saturn's dipole magnetic field is not tilted relative to its rotation axis (unlike Jupiter, Uranus and Neptune), so the surrogate measure of its long-wavelength (kilometric) radiation is currently used to fix the System III rotation period(2). The period as measured now by the Cassini spacecraft is up to similar to 7 min longer(3) than the value of 10 h 39 min 24 s measured 28 years ago by Voyager(2). Here we report a determination of Saturn's rotation period based on an analysis of potential vorticity. The resulting reference frame (which we call System IIIw) rotates with a period of 10 h 34 min 13 +/- 20 s. This shifted reference frame is consistent with a pattern of alternating jets on Saturn that is more symmetrical between eastward and westward flow.

At a given density, particulate systems pack into a mechanically stable and amorphous jammed state(3,4). Previous theoretical studies have explored a connection between this jammed state and the glass transition(4-8), the thermodynamics of jamming(9-12) and geometric modelling of random packings(13-15). Nevertheless, a simple underlying mechanism for the random assembly of athermal particles, analogous to crystalline ordering, remains unknown. Here we use three-dimensional measurements of packings of polydisperse emulsion droplets to build a simple statistical model in which the complexity of the global packing is distilled into a local stochastic process. From the perspective of a single particle, the packing problem is reduced to the random formation of nearest neighbours, followed by a choice of contacts among them. The two key parameters in the model-the available space around a particle and the ratio of contacts to neighbours-are directly obtained from experiments. We demonstrate that this 'granocentric' view captures the properties of the polydisperse emulsion packing-ranging from the microscopic distributions of nearest neighbours and contacts, to local density fluctuations, to the global packing density. Application of our results to monodisperse and bidisperse systems produces quantitative agreement with previously measured trends in global density(16). Our model therefore reveals a general principle of organization for random packing and may provide the foundations for a theory of jammed matter.","[Clusel, Maxime; Corwin, Eric I.; Siemens, Alexander O.

Northern peatlands contain one-third of the world's soil organic carbon, equivalent to more than half the amount of carbon in the atmosphere(2). Climate-warming-induced acceleration of carbon dioxide (CO(2)) emissions through enhanced respiration of thick peat deposits, centuries to millennia old, may form a strong positive carbon cycle-climate feedback. The long-term temperature sensitivity of carbon in peatlands, especially at depth, remains uncertain, however, because of the short duration or correlative nature of field studies(3-5) and the disturbance associated with respiration measurements below the surface in situ or during laboratory incubations(6,7). Here we combine non-disturbing in situ measurements of CO(2) respiration rates and isotopic ((13)C) composition of respired CO(2) in two whole-ecosystem climate-manipulation experiments in a subarctic peatland. We show that approximately 1 degrees C warming accelerated total ecosystem respiration rates on average by 60% in spring and by 52% in summer and that this effect was sustained for at least eight years. While warming stimulated both short-term (plant-related) and longer-term (peat soil-related) carbon respiration processes, we find that at least 69% of the increase in respiration rate originated from carbon in peat towards the bottom (25-50 cm) of the active layer above the permafrost. Climate warming therefore accelerates respiration of the extensive, subsurface carbon reservoirs in peatlands to a much larger extent than was previously thought(6,7). Assuming that our data from a single site are indicative of the direct response to warming of northern peatland soils on a global scale, we estimate that climate warming of about 1 degrees C over the next few decades could induce a global increase in heterotrophic respiration of 38-100 megatonnes of C per year. Our findings suggest a large, long-lasting, positive feedback of carbon stored in northern peatlands to the global climate system.","[Dorrepaal, Ellen; Toet, Sylvia; van Logtestijn, Richard S.

In particular, the platinum group element (PGE) contents of komatiites provide a unique source of information on core formation, mantle differentiation and possibly core-mantle interaction(2-8). Most of the available PGE data on komatiites are from late Archaean (similar to 2.7-2.9 Gyr old) or early Proterozoic (2.0-2.5 Gyr old) samples. Here we show that most early Archaean (3.5-3.2 Gyr old) komatiites from the Barberton greenstone belt of South Africa and the Pilbara craton of Western Australia are depleted in PGE relative to late Archaean and younger komatiites. Early Archaean komatiites record a signal of PGE depletion in the lower mantle, resulting from core formation. This signal diminishes with time owing to progressive mixing-in to the deep mantle of PGE-enriched cosmic material that the Earth accreted as the 'late veneer' during the Early Archaean (4.5-3.8 Gyr ago) meteorite bombardment.","[Maier, Wolfgang D.] Univ Oulu, Dept Geol, Oulu 90014, Finland; [Maier, Wolfgang D.; Fiorentini, Marco L.] Univ Western Australia, Ctr Explorat Targeting, Crawley 6009, Australia; [Barnes, Stephen J.] CSIRO, Kensington, WA 6151, Australia; [Campbell, Ian H.] Australian Natl Univ, Res Sch Earth Sci, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia; [Peltonen, Petri] Geol Survey Finland, Espoo 02151, Finland; [Peltonen, Petri] Univ Helsinki, Dept Geol, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland; [Barnes, Sarah-Jane] Univ Quebec Chicoutimi, Chicoutimi, PQ G7H 2B1, Canada; [Smithies, R.

Measurements indicate elevated turbulent dissipation-comparable with levels caused by winds and tides-in the vicinity of large populations of planktonic animals swimming together(1). However, it has also been noted that elevated turbulent dissipation is by itself insufficient proof of substantial biogenic mixing, because much of the turbulent kinetic energy of small animals is injected below the Ozmidov buoyancy length scale, where it is primarily dissipated as heat by the fluid viscosity before it can affect ocean mixing(2). Ongoing debate regarding biogenic mixing has focused on comparisons between animal wake turbulence and ocean turbulence(3,4). Here, we show that a second, previously neglected mechanism of fluid mixing-first described over 50 years ago by Charles Darwin(5)-is the dominant mechanism of mixing by swimming animals. The efficiency of mixing by Darwin's mechanism is dependent on animal shape rather than fluid length scale and, unlike turbulent wake mixing, is enhanced by fluid viscosity. Therefore, it provides a means of biogenic mixing that can be equally effective in small zooplankton and large mammals. A theoretical model for the relative contributions of Darwinian mixing and turbulent wake mixing is created and validated by in situ field measurements of swimming jellyfish using a newly developed scuba-based laser velocimetry device(6). Extrapolation of these results to other animals is straightforward given knowledge of the animal shape and orientation during vertical migration. On the basis of calculations of a broad range of aquatic animal species, we conclude that biogenic mixing via Darwin's mechanism can be a significant contributor to ocean mixing and nutrient transport.","[Dabiri, John O.] CALTECH, Grad Aeronaut Labs, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA","Dabiri, JO (reprint author), CALTECH, Grad Aeronaut Labs, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA.",kakani@caltech.edu; jodabiri@caltech.edu,,,National Science Foundation Biological Oceanography Program; NSF; Office of Naval Research; NDSEG; Charles Lee Powell Foundation,"We acknowledge W.

Several in vitro studies support the critical role of Pax7 in these functions of adult muscle stem cells(5-8) (satellite cells), but a formal demonstration has been lacking in vivo. Here we show, through the application of inducible Cre/loxP lineage tracing(9) and conditional gene inactivation to the tibialis anterior muscle regeneration paradigm, that, unexpectedly, when Pax7 is inactivated in adult mice, mutant satellite cells are not compromised in muscle regeneration, they can proliferate and reoccupy the sublaminal satellite niche, and they are able to support further regenerative processes. Dual adult inactivation of Pax3 and Pax7 also results in normal muscle regeneration. Multiple time points of gene inactivation reveal that Pax7 is only required up to the juvenile period when progenitor cells make the transition into quiescence. Furthermore, we demonstrate a cell-intrinsic difference between neonatal progenitor and adult satellite cells in their Pax7-dependency. Our finding of an age-dependent change in the genetic requirement for muscle stem cells cautions against inferring adult stem-cell biology from embryonic studies, and has direct implications for the use of stem cells from hosts of different ages in transplantation-based therapy.","[Lepper, Christoph; Fan, Chen-Ming] Carnegie Inst, Dept Embryol, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA; [Lepper, Christoph] Johns Hopkins Univ, Dept Biol, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA; [Conway, Simon J.] Indiana Univ Sch Med, Herman B Wells Ctr Pediat Res, Riley Heart Res Ctr, Indianapolis, IN 46202 USA","Lepper, C (reprint author), Carnegie Inst, Dept Embryol, 3520 San Martin Dr, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA.",lepper@ciwemb.edu; fan@ciwemb.edu,,,Carnegie Institution; NIH; Riley Children's Foundation,"We thank E.

Loss of presenilin activity and/or accumulation of amyloid-beta peptides have been proposed to mediate the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease by impairing synaptic function(1-5). However, the precise site and nature of the synaptic dysfunction remain unknown. Here we use a genetic approach to inactivate presenilins conditionally in either presynaptic (CA3) or postsynaptic (CA1) neurons of the hippocampal Schaeffer-collateral pathway. We show that long-term potentiation induced by theta-burst stimulation is decreased after presynaptic but not postsynaptic deletion of presenilins. Moreover, we found that presynaptic but not postsynaptic inactivation of presenilins alters short-term plasticity and synaptic facilitation. The probability of evoked glutamate release, measured with the open-channel NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) receptor antagonist MK-801, is reduced by presynaptic inactivation of presenilins. Notably, depletion of endoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) stores by thapsigargin, or blockade of Ca(2+) release from these stores by ryanodine receptor inhibitors, mimics and occludes the effects of presynaptic presenilin inactivation. Collectively, these results indicate a selective role for presenilins in the activity-dependent regulation of neurotransmitter release and long-term potentiation induction by modulation of intracellular Ca(2+) release in presynaptic terminals, and further suggest that presynaptic dysfunction might be an early pathogenic event leading to dementia and neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease.","[Zhang, Chen; Wu, Bei; Beglopoulos, Vassilios; Wines-Samuelson, Mary; Zhang, Dawei; Shen, Jie] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Brigham & Womens Hosp, Ctr Neurol Dis,Program Neurosci, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Zhang, Chen; Suedhof, Thomas C.] Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Dept Mol & Cellular Physiol, Palo Alto, CA 94304 USA; [Dragatsis, Ioannis] Univ Tennessee, Hlth Sci Ctr, Dept Physiol, Memphis, TN 38163 USA","Shen, J (reprint author), Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Brigham & Womens Hosp, Ctr Neurol Dis,Program Neurosci, Boston, MA 02115 USA.",jshen@rics.bwh.harvard.edu,"Wu, Bei/F-6659-2012",,National Institutes of Health [R01NS041783],"We would like to thank K.

Their ability to phagocytose and clear microorganisms has been well documented(1,2). Macrophages possess several substances with which they can kill bacteria, including reactive oxygen species, nitric oxide, and antimicrobial proteins(3-9). We proposed that macrophage-derived proteinases may contribute to the antimicrobial properties of macrophages. Macrophage elastase (also known as matrix metalloproteinase 12 or MMP12) is an enzyme predominantly expressed in mature tissue macrophages(10) and is implicated in several disease processes, including emphysema(11). Physiological functions for MMP12 have not been described. Here we show that Mmp12(-/-) mice exhibit impaired bacterial clearance and increased mortality when challenged with both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria at macrophage-rich portals of entry, such as the peritoneum and lung. Intracellular stores of MMP12 are mobilized to macrophage phagolysosomes after the ingestion of bacterial pathogens. Once inside phagolysosomes, MMP12 adheres to bacterial cell walls where it disrupts cellular membranes resulting in bacterial death. The antimicrobial properties of MMP12 do not reside within its catalytic domain, but rather within the carboxyterminal domain. This domain contains a unique four amino acid sequence on an exposed beta loop of the protein that is required for the observed antimicrobial activity. The present study represents, to our knowledge, the first report of direct antimicrobial activity by a matrix metallopeptidase, and describes a new antimicrobial peptide that is sequentially and structurally unique in nature.","[Houghton, A.

This transition is accompanied by a switch in ATP-dependent chromatin-remodelling mechanisms that appears to coincide with the final mitotic division of neurons. This switch involves the exchange of the BAF53a (also known as ACTL6a) and BAF45a (PHF10) subunits within Swi/Snf-like neural-progenitor-specific BAF (npBAF) complexes for the homologous BAF53b (ACTL6b) and BAF45b (DPF1) subunits within neuron-specific BAF (nBAF) complexes in post-mitotic neurons. The subunits of the npBAF complex are essential for neural-progenitor proliferation, and mice with reduced dosage for the genes encoding its subunits have defects in neural-tube closure similar to those in human spina bifida(3), one of the most serious congenital birth defects. In contrast, BAF53b and the nBAF complex are essential for an evolutionarily conserved program of post-mitotic neural development and dendritic morphogenesis(4,5). Here we show that this essential transition is mediated by repression of BAF53a by miR-9* and miR-124. We find that BAF53a repression is mediated by sequences in the 3' untranslated region corresponding to the recognition sites for miR-9* and miR-124, which are selectively expressed in post-mitotic neurons. Mutation of these sites led to persistent expression of BAF53a and defective activity-dependent dendritic outgrowth in neurons. In addition, overexpression of miR-9* and miR-124 in neural progenitors caused reduced proliferation. Previous studies have indicated that miR-9* and miR-124 are repressed by the repressor-element-1-silencing transcription factor (REST, also known as NRSF)(6). Indeed, expression of REST in post-mitotic neurons led to derepression of BAF53a, indicating that REST-mediated repression of microRNAs directs the essential switch of chromatin regulatory complexes.","[Yoo, Andrew S.; Staahl, Brett T.; Chen, Lei; Crabtree, Gerald R.] Stanford Univ, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Yoo, Andrew S.; Staahl, Brett T.; Chen, Lei; Crabtree, Gerald R.] Stanford Univ, Dept Dev Biol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Yoo, Andrew S.; Chen, Lei; Crabtree, Gerald R.] Stanford Univ, Dept Pathol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA","Crabtree, GR (reprint author), Stanford Univ, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",crabtree@stanford.edu,,"Yoo, Andrew/0000-0002-0304-3247","Helen Hay Whitney Foundation; US National Institutes of Health (NIH) [2 T32 HD007249]; Howard Hughes Medical Institute; NIH [HD55391, AI060037, NS046789]","We thank J.

XCI is an example of epigenetic regulation(1). Once enacted in individual cells of the early female embryo, XCI is stably transmitted such that most descendant cells maintain silencing of that X chromosome(2). In eutherian mammals, XCI is thought to be triggered by the expression of the non-coding Xist RNA from the future inactive X chromosome (Xi)(3-5); Xist RNA in turn is proposed to recruit protein complexes that bring about heterochromatinization of the Xi(6,7). Here we test whether imprinted XCI, which results in preferential inactivation of the paternal X chromosome (Xp), occurs in mouse embryos inheriting an Xp lacking Xist. We find that silencing of Xp-linked genes can initiate in the absence of paternal Xist; Xist is, however, required to stabilize silencing along the Xp. Xp-linked gene silencing associated with mouse imprinted XCI, therefore, can initiate in the embryo independently of Xist RNA.","[Kalantry, Sundeep; Purushothaman, Sonya; Bowen, Randall Bryant; Starmer, Joshua; Magnuson, Terry] Univ N Carolina, Dept Genet, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA; [Kalantry, Sundeep; Purushothaman, Sonya; Bowen, Randall Bryant; Starmer, Joshua; Magnuson, Terry] Univ N Carolina, Carolina Ctr Genome Sci, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA; [Kalantry, Sundeep; Purushothaman, Sonya; Bowen, Randall Bryant; Starmer, Joshua; Magnuson, Terry] Univ N Carolina, Lineberger Comprehens Canc Ctr, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA","Magnuson, T (reprint author), Univ N Carolina, Dept Genet, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA.",trm4@med.unc.edu,,,American Cancer Society; US National Institutes of Health,"We thank R.

Notably, trimethylated H3K27 (H3K27me3) is significantly enriched at developmental promoters that are repressed in early embryos, including many bivalent (H3K4me3/H3K27me3) promoters in embryonic stem cells. Furthermore, developmental promoters are generally DNA hypomethylated in sperm, but acquire methylation during differentiation. Taken together, epigenetic marking in sperm is extensive, and correlated with developmental regulators.","[Hammoud, Saher Sue; Carrell, Douglas T.] Univ Utah, Sch Med, IVF & Androl Labs, Dept Surg, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA; [Hammoud, Saher Sue; Carrell, Douglas T.] Univ Utah, Sch Med, IVF & Androl Labs, Dept Obstet & Gynecol, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA; [Hammoud, Saher Sue; Carrell, Douglas T.] Univ Utah, Sch Med, IVF & Androl Labs, Dept Physiol, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA; [Hammoud, Saher Sue; Zhang, Haiying; Purwar, Jahnvi; Cairns, Bradley R.] Univ Utah, Sch Med, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Dept Oncol Sci, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA; [Nix, David A.] Univ Utah, Sch Med, Huntsman Canc Inst, Res Informat & Bioinformat Core Facil, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA","Carrell, DT (reprint author), Univ Utah, Sch Med, IVF & Androl Labs, Dept Surg, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA.",douglas.carrell@hsc.utah.edu; brad.cairns@hci.utah.edu,,,"Howard Hughes Medical Institute; NCI NIH HHS [CA16056, CA24014, P30 CA016056]",,,39,570,592,4,57,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,23-Jul,2009,460,7254,,,,,473,U47,,10.1038/nature08162,,7,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,474BK,WOS:000268257000030,19525931,No,Y,N,11/20/17

Here we use HITS-CLIP to covalently crosslink native argonaute (Ago, also called Eif2c) protein-RNA complexes in mouse brain. This produced two simultaneous data sets-Ago-miRNA and Ago-mRNA binding sites-that were combined with bioinformatic analysis to identify interaction sites between miRNA and target mRNA. We validated genome-wide interaction maps for miR-124, and generated additional maps for the 20 most abundant miRNAs present in P13 mouse brain. Ago HITS-CLIP provides a general platform for exploring the specificity and range of miRNA action in vivo, and identifies precise sequences for targeting clinically relevant miRNA-mRNA interactions.","[Chi, Sung Wook; Zang, Julie B.; Mele, Aldo; Darnell, Robert B.] Rockefeller Univ, Mol Neurooncol Lab, New York, NY 10021 USA; [Chi, Sung Wook; Zang, Julie B.; Mele, Aldo; Darnell, Robert B.] Rockefeller Univ, Howard Hughes Med Inst, New York, NY 10021 USA","Darnell, RB (reprint author), Rockefeller Univ, Mol Neurooncol Lab, 1230 York Ave, New York, NY 10021 USA.",darnelr@rockefeller.edu,"Darnell, Robert/B-9022-2008","Darnell, Robert/0000-0002-5134-8088",NIH; Cornell/Rockefeller/Sloan-Kettering Tri-Institutional Program in Computational Biology and Medicine; MD-PhD Program,"We thank members of the Darnell laboratory for discussion, J.

The source of the jets may be a liquid water region under the ice shell-as suggested most recently by the discovery of salts in E-ring particles derived from the plume(6)-or warm ice that is heated, causing dissociation of clathrate hydrates(7). Here we report that ammonia is present in the plume, along with various organic compounds, deuterium and, very probably, Ar-40. The presence of ammonia provides strong evidence for the existence of at least some liquid water, given that temperatures in excess of 180 K have been measured near the fractures from which the jets emanate(8). We conclude, from the overall composition of the material, that the plume derives from both a liquid reservoir (or from ice that in recent geological time has been in contact with such a reservoir) as well as from degassing, volatile-charged ice.","[Waite, J.

The particles are believed to be evenly distributed between the two hemispheres, from the source region in the equatorial plane of the magnetosphere. Although it has been shown that similar auroral features in the opposite hemispheres can be displaced tens of degree in longitude(1,2) and that seasonal effects can cause differences in global intensity(3,4), the overall auroral patterns were still similar. Here we report observations that clearly contradict the common assumption about symmetric aurora: intense spots are seen at dawn in the Northern summer Hemisphere, and at dusk in the Southern winter Hemisphere.

In 1964, Bell showed that certain types of classical models cannot explain the quantum mechanical predictions for specific states of distant particles, and some types of hidden variable models(3-9) have been experimentally ruled out. An intuitive feature of classical models is non-contextuality: the property that any measurement has a value independent of other compatible measurements being carried out at the same time. However, a theorem derived by Kochen, Specker and Bell(10-12) shows that non-contextuality is in conflict with quantum mechanics. The conflict resides in the structure of the theory and is independent of the properties of special states. It has been debated whether the Kochen-Specker theorem could be experimentally tested at all(13,14). First tests of quantum contextuality have been proposed only recently, and undertaken with photons(15,16) and neutrons(17,18). But these tests required the generation of special quantum states and left various loopholes open. Here we perform an experiment with trapped ions that demonstrates a state-independent conflict with non-contextuality. The experiment is not subject to the detection loophole and we show that, despite imperfections and possible measurement disturbances, our results cannot be explained in non-contextual terms.","[Kirchmair, G.; Zaehringer, F.; Gerritsma, R.; Kleinmann, M.; Guehne, O.; Blatt, R.; Roos, C.

Recently, it has been demonstrated that this limit can be overcome by lensing effects driven by surface-plasmon excitation(1-3), and by fluorescence microscopy driven by molecular excitation(4). However, the resolution obtained using geometrical lens-based optics without such excitation schemes remains limited by Abbe's law even when using the immersion technique(5), which enhances the resolution by increasing the refractive indices of immersion liquids. As for submicrometre-scale or nanoscale objects, standard geometrical optics fails for visible light because the interactions of such objects with light waves are described inevitably by near-field optics(6). Here we report near-field high resolution by nanoscale spherical lenses that are self-assembled by bottom-up integration(7) of organic molecules. These nano-lenses, in contrast to geometrical optics lenses, exhibit curvilinear trajectories of light, resulting in remarkably short near-field focal lengths. This in turn results in near-field magnification that is able to resolve features beyond the diffraction limit. Such spherical nanolenses provide new pathways for lens-based near-field focusing and high-resolution optical imaging at very low intensities, which are useful for bio-imaging, near-field lithography, optical memory storage, light harvesting, spectral signal enhancing, and optical nano-sensing.","[Lee, Ju Young; Hong, Byung Hee; Kim, Woo Youn; Min, Seung Kyu; Kim, Yukyung; Jouravlev, Mikhail V.; Hwang, In-Chul; Kim, Kwang S.] Pohang Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Chem, Ctr Superfunct Mat, Pohang 790784, South Korea; [Hong, Byung Hee; Kim, Keun Soo] Sungkyunkwan Univ, Dept Chem, Suwon 440746, South Korea; [Hong, Byung Hee; Kim, Keun Soo] Sungkyunkwan Univ, SKKU Adv Inst Nanotechnol, Suwon 440746, South Korea; [Bose, Ranojoy; Wong, Chee Wei] Columbia Univ, Dept Mech Engn, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Kaufman, Laura J.] Columbia Univ, Dept Chem, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Kim, Philip] Columbia Univ, Dept Phys, New York, NY 10027 USA","Kim, KS (reprint author), Pohang Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Chem, Ctr Superfunct Mat, Pohang 790784, South Korea.",pkim@phys.columbia.edu; kim@postech.ac.kr,"; Kim, Woo Youn/C-1846-2011; Kim, Kwang/C-7538-2012; Kim, Keun Soo/C-1601-2013; Kim, Philip/N-1886-2013; Min, Seung Kyu/E-9517-2015; Wong, Chee Wei/E-9169-2017","Kaufman, Laura/0000-0002-3754-0831; Kim, Woo Youn/0000-0001-7152-2111; Kim, Kwang/0000-0002-6929-5359; Min, Seung Kyu/0000-0001-5636-3407; Bose, Ranojoy/0000-0002-2908-4426","Korea Foundation for International Cooperation of Science and Technology; Korea Government [R32-2008-000-10180-0, R33-2008-000-10138-0, 2009-0063312, 2009-0062808, 2009-0060271]; Brain Korea 21 (Korea Research Foundation); National Science Foundation [CHE-0641523, ECCS-0747787]; New York State Office of Science (NYSTAR)","We thank T.

Despite the prevalence of uniform valley spacing, no theory has been shown to predict this fundamental topographic wavelength. Models of long-term landscape evolution can produce landforms that look realistic(7-9), but few metrics exist to assess the similarity between models and natural landscapes. Here we show that the ridge-valley wavelength can be predicted from erosional mechanics. From equations of mass conservation and sediment transport, we derive a characteristic length scale at which the time-scales for erosion by diffusive soil creep and advective stream incision are equal. This length scale is directly proportional to the valley spacing that emerges in a numerical model of landform evolution, and to the measured valley spacing at five field sites. Our results provide a quantitative explanation for one of the most widely observed characteristics of landscapes. The findings also imply that valley spacing is a fundamental topographic signature that records how material properties and climate regulate erosional processes.","[Perron, J.

Limitation of productivity by nutrient availability is an established paradigm for lake ecosystems(1-3). Here, we assess the relevance of this paradigm for a majority of the world's small, nutrient-poor lakes, with different concentrations of coloured organic matter(4,5). By comparing small unproductive lakes along a water colour gradient, we show that coloured terrestrial organic matter controls the key process for new biomass synthesis (the benthic primary production) through its effects on light attenuation. We also show that this translates into effects on production and biomass of higher trophic levels (benthic invertebrates and fish). These results are inconsistent with the idea that nutrient supply primarily controls lake productivity, and we propose that a large share of the world's unproductive lakes, within natural variations of organic carbon and nutrient input, are limited by light and not by nutrients. We anticipate that our result will have implications for understanding lake ecosystem function and responses to environmental change. Catchment export of coloured organic matter is sensitive to short-term natural variability and long-term, large-scale changes, driven by climate and different anthropogenic influences(6,7). Consequently, changes in terrestrial carbon cycling will have pronounced effects on most lake ecosystems by mediating changes in light climate and productivity of lakes.","[Karlsson, Jan] Umea Univ, Dept Ecol & Environm Sci, CIRC, SE-98107 Abisko, Sweden; [Bystrom, Par; Ask, Jenny; Ask, Per; Persson, Lennart; Jansson, Mats] Umea Univ, Dept Ecol & Environm Sci, SE-90187 Umea, Sweden","Karlsson, J (reprint author), Umea Univ, Dept Ecol & Environm Sci, CIRC, Box 62, SE-98107 Abisko, Sweden.",Jan.Karlsson@emg.umu.se,"Persson, Lennart/B-2885-2012","Ask, Jenny/0000-0003-2156-4908","Formas (the Swedish Research Council for Environment, Agricultural Sciences and Spatial Planning)","The study was part of the research environment LEREC (Lake Ecosystem Response to Environmental Change), financially supported by Formas (the Swedish Research Council for Environment, Agricultural Sciences and Spatial Planning).

This phenomenon, known as partial penetrance, has been observed in diverse developmental systems. However, it remains unclear how the underlying genetic network specifies the set of possible alternative fates and how the relative frequencies of these fates evolve(5-8). Here we identify a stochastic cell fate determination process that operates in Bacillus subtilis sporulation mutants and show how it allows genetic control of the penetrance of multiple fates. Mutations in an intercompartmental signalling process generate a set of discrete alternative fates not observed in wild-type cells, including rare formation of two viable 'twin' spores, rather than one within a single cell. By genetically modulating chromosome replication and septation, we can systematically tune the penetrance of each mutant fate. Furthermore, signalling and replication perturbations synergize to significantly increase the penetrance of twin sporulation. These results suggest a potential pathway for developmental evolution between monosporulation and twin sporulation through states of intermediate twin penetrance. Furthermore, time-lapse microscopy of twin sporulation in wild-type Clostridium oceanicum shows a strong resemblance to twin sporulation in these B. subtilis mutants(9,10). Together the results suggest that noise can facilitate developmental evolution by enabling the initial expression of discrete morphological traits at low penetrance, and allowing their stabilization by gradual adjustment of genetic parameters.","[Eldar, Avigdor; Fontes, Michelle E.; Loson, Oliver C.; Elowitz, Michael B.] CALTECH, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA; [Eldar, Avigdor; Fontes, Michelle E.; Loson, Oliver C.; Elowitz, Michael B.] CALTECH, Div Biol, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA; [Eldar, Avigdor; Fontes, Michelle E.; Loson, Oliver C.; Elowitz, Michael B.] CALTECH, Dept Appl Phys, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA; [Chary, Vasant K.; Xenopoulos, Panagiotis; Piggot, Patrick J.] Temple Univ, Sch Med, Dept Microbiol & Immunol, Philadelphia, PA 19140 USA; [Dworkin, Jonathan] Columbia Univ, Coll Phys & Surg, Dept Microbiol, New York, NY 10032 USA","Elowitz, MB (reprint author), CALTECH, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA.",melowitz@caltech.edu,,"Eldar, Avigdor/0000-0001-8485-9370","US National Institutes of Health (NIH) [GM43577]; NIH [R01GM079771, P50 GM068763]; US National Science Foundation CAREER Award [0644463]; Packard Foundation; International Human Frontier Science Organization; European Molecular Biology Organization","We thank J.

Unlike the human viruses, however, SIVs do not generally cause acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) in their natural hosts(3). Here we show that SIVcpz, the immediate precursor of HIV-1, is pathogenic in free-ranging chimpanzees. By following 94 members of two habituated chimpanzee communities in Gombe National Park, Tanzania, for over 9 years, we found a 10- to 16-fold higher age-corrected death hazard for SIVcpz-infected (n = 17) compared to uninfected (n = 77) chimpanzees. We also found that SIVcpz-infected females were less likely to give birth and had a higher infant mortality rate than uninfected females. Immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization of post-mortem spleen and lymph node samples from three infected and two uninfected chimpanzees revealed significant CD4(+) T-cell depletion in all infected individuals, with evidence of high viral replication and extensive follicular dendritic cell virus trapping in one of them. One female, who died within 3 years of acquiring SIVcpz, had histopathological findings consistent with end-stage AIDS. These results indicate that SIVcpz, like HIV-1, is associated with progressive CD4(+) T-cell loss, lymphatic tissue destruction and premature death. These findings challenge the prevailing view that all natural SIV infections are non-pathogenic and suggest that SIVcpz has a substantial negative impact on the health, reproduction and lifespan of chimpanzees in the wild.","[Keele, Brandon F.; Li, Yingying; Learn, Gerald H.; Shaw, George M.; Hahn, Beatrice H.] Univ Alabama, Dept Med, Birmingham, AL 35294 USA; [Rudicell, Rebecca S.; Hahn, Beatrice H.] Univ Alabama, Dept Microbiol, Birmingham, AL 35294 USA; [Beasley, T.

One of the damage-associated molecular patterns is chromosomal DNA that escapes degradation. In programmed cell death and erythropoiesis, DNA from dead cells or nuclei expelled from erythroblasts is digested by DNase II in the macrophages after they are engulfed. DNase II(-/-) (also known as Dnase2a(-/-)) mice suffer from severe anaemia or chronic arthritis due to interferon-beta (IFN-beta) and tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) produced from the macrophages carrying undigested DNA(2,3) in a Toll-like receptor (TLR)-independent mechanism(4). Here we show that Eyes absent 4 (EYA4), originally identified as a co-transcription factor, stimulates the expression of IFN-beta and CXCL10 in response to the undigested DNA of apoptotic cells. EYA4 enhanced the innate immune response against viruses (Newcastle disease virus and vesicular stomatitis virus), and could associate with signalling molecules (IPS-1 (also known as MAVS), STING (TMEM173) and NLRX1). Three groups have previously shown that EYA has phosphatase activity(5-7). We found that mouse EYA family members act as a phosphatase for both phosphotyrosine and phosphothreonine. The haloacid dehalogenase domain at the carboxy terminus contained the tyrosine-phosphatase, and the amino-terminal half carried the threonine-phosphatase. Mutations of the threonine-phosphatase, but not the tyrosine-phosphatase, abolished the ability of EYA4 to enhance the innate immune response, suggesting that EYA regulates the innate immune response by modulating the phosphorylation state of signal transducers for the intracellular pathogens.","[Okabe, Yasutaka; Sano, Teruyuki; Nagata, Shigekazu] Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Med, Dept Med Chem, Kyoto 6068501, Japan; [Okabe, Yasutaka; Nagata, Shigekazu] Japan Sci & Technol Corp, Kyoto 6068501, Japan","Nagata, S (reprint author), Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Med, Dept Med Chem, Kyoto 6068501, Japan.",snagata@mfour.med.kyoto-u.ac.jp,,,"Ministry of Education, Science, Sports, and Culture in Japan","We thank T.

SNAREs represent an evolutionarily conserved protein family that mediates membrane fusion in the secretory and endocytic pathways of eukaryotic cells(1-3). On membrane contact, these proteins assemble in trans between the membranes as a bundle of four alpha-helices, with the energy released during assembly being thought to drive fusion(4-6). However, it is unclear how the energy is transferred to the membranes and whether assembly is conformationally linked to fusion. Here, we report the X-ray structure of the neuronal SNARE complex, consisting of rat syntaxin 1A, SNAP-25 and synaptobrevin 2, with the carboxy-terminal linkers and transmembrane regions at 3.4 angstrom resolution. The structure shows that assembly proceeds beyond the already known core SNARE complex(7), resulting in a continuous helical bundle that is further stabilized by side-chain interactions in the linker region. Our results suggest that the final phase of SNARE assembly is directly coupled to membrane merger.","[Stein, Alexander; Jahn, Reinhard] Max Planck Inst Biophys Chem, Dept Neurobiol, D-37077 Gottingen, Germany; [Weber, Gert; Wahl, Markus C.] Max Planck Inst Biophys Chem, Res Grp Xray Crystallog, D-37077 Gottingen, Germany; [Weber, Gert; Wahl, Markus C.] Free Univ Berlin, Fachbereich Biol, Inst Chem & Biochem, AG Strukturbiochem, D-14195 Berlin, Germany","Jahn, R (reprint author), Max Planck Inst Biophys Chem, Dept Neurobiol, D-37077 Gottingen, Germany.",rjahn@gwdg.de,"Weber, Gert/I-1800-2013; Stein, Alexander/I-4950-2012; Wahl, Markus/D-6365-2017","Stein, Alexander/0000-0002-2696-0611; Wahl, Markus/0000-0002-2811-5307; Jahn, Reinhard/0000-0003-1542-3498","NIGMS NIH HHS [P01 GM072694, P01 GM072694-01]",,,49,205,208,3,42,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,23-Jul,2009,460,7254,,,,,525,U105,,10.1038/nature08156,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,474BK,WOS:000268257000041,19571812,No,,,11/20/17

Although miRNAs can function as both tumour suppressors and oncogenes in tumour development(1), a widespread downregulation of miRNAs is commonly observed in human cancers and promotes cellular transformation and tumorigenesis(2-4). This indicates an inherent significance of small RNAs in tumour suppression. However, the connection between tumour suppressor networks and miRNA biogenesis machineries has not been investigated in depth. Here we show that a central tumour suppressor, p53, enhances the post-transcriptional maturation of several miRNAs with growth-suppressive function, including miR-16-1, miR-143 and miR-145, in response to DNA damage. In HCT116 cells and human diploid fibroblasts, p53 interacts with the Drosha processing complex through the association with DEAD-box RNA helicase p68 (also known as DDX5) and facilitates the processing of primary miRNAs to precursor miRNAs. We also found that transcriptionally inactive p53 mutants interfere with a functional assembly between Drosha complex and p68, leading to attenuation of miRNA processing activity. These findings suggest that transcription-independent modulation of miRNA biogenesis is intrinsically embedded in a tumour suppressive program governed by p53. Our study reveals a previously unrecognized function of p53 in miRNA processing, which may underlie key aspects of cancer biology.","[Suzuki, Hiroshi I.; Miyazono, Kohei] Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Med, Dept Mol Pathol, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo 1130033, Japan; [Yamagata, Kaoru; Kato, Shigeaki] Univ Tokyo, Inst Mol & Cellular Biosci, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo 1130032, Japan; [Yamagata, Kaoru; Kato, Shigeaki] Japan Sci & Technol Agcy, ERATO, Kawaguchisi, Saitama 3320012, Japan; [Sugimoto, Koichi] Juntendo Univ, Sch Med, Dept Internal Med, Div Hematol,Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo 1138421, Japan; [Iwamoto, Takashi] Chubu Univ, Coll Life & Hlth Sci, Dept Biomed Sci, Aichi 4878501, Japan; [Iwamoto, Takashi] Chubu Univ, Ctr Educ Lab Anim Res, Aichi 4878501, Japan","Miyazono, K (reprint author), Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Med, Dept Mol Pathol, Bunkyo Ku, 7-3-1 Hongo, Tokyo 1130033, Japan.",miyazono@m.u-tokyo.ac.jp,,,"KAKENHI [17016011]; Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology of Japan; Japan Society for the Promotion of Science for Young Scientists","We thank H.

Hepatic glucose production is increased in obesity, reflecting chronic increases in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress that promote insulin resistance(3). Whether ER stress also modulates the gluconeogenic program directly, however, is unclear. Here we show that CRTC2 functions as a dual sensor for ER stress and fasting signals. Acute increases in ER stress triggered the dephosphorylation and nuclear entry of CRTC2, which in turn promoted the expression of ER quality control genes through an association with activating transcription factor 6 alpha (ATF6 alpha, also known as ATF6)-an integral branch of the unfolded protein response(4-9). In addition to mediating CRTC2 recruitment to ER stress inducible promoters, ATF6 alpha also reduced hepatic glucose output by disrupting the CREB-CRTC2 interaction and thereby inhibiting CRTC2 occupancy over gluconeogenic genes. Conversely, hepatic glucose output was upregulated when hepatic ATF6 alpha protein amounts were reduced, either by RNA interference (RNAi)-mediated knockdown or as a result of persistent stress in obesity. Because ATF6 alpha overexpression in the livers of obese mice reversed CRTC2 effects on the gluconeogenic program and lowered hepatic glucose output, our results demonstrate how cross-talk between ER stress and fasting pathways at the level of a transcriptional coactivator contributes to glucose homeostasis.","[Wang, Yiguo; Vera, Liliana; Fischer, Wolfgang H.; Montminy, Marc] Salk Inst Biol Studies, Clayton Fdn Labs Peptide Biol, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA","Montminy, M (reprint author), Salk Inst Biol Studies, Clayton Fdn Labs Peptide Biol, 10010 N Torrey Pines Rd, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA.",montminy@salk.edu,,,National Institutes of Health; Clayton Foundation for Medical Research; Keickhefer Foundation; Vincent J.

The genome provides a global insight into the molecular architecture and host interaction of this complex metazoan pathogen, revealing that it can exploit host nutrients, neuroendocrine hormones and signalling pathways for growth, development and maturation. Having a complex nervous system and a well-developed sensory system, S. japonicum can accept stimulation of the corresponding ligands as a physiological response to different environments, such as fresh water or the tissues of its intermediate and mammalian hosts. Numerous proteases, including cercarial elastase, are implicated in mammalian skin penetration and haemoglobin degradation. The genomic information will serve as a valuable platform to facilitate development of new interventions for schistosomiasis control.","[Zhou, Yan; Zheng, Huajun; Chen, Yangyi; Zhang, Lei; Wang, Kai; Guo, Jing; Huang, Zhen; Zhang, Bo; Huang, Wei; Chen, Zhu; Wang, Zhi-Qin; Han, Ze-Guang; Lu, Gang; Ren, Shuangxi; Wang, Yuezhu; Gu, Wenyi; Kang, Hui; Chen, Jie; Chen, Xiaoyun; Chen, Shuting; Wang, Lijun; Yan, Jie; Wang, Biyun; Lv, Xinyan; Jin, Lei; Wang, Bofei; Pu, Shiyin; Zhang, Xianglin; Zhang, Wei; Hu, Qiuping; Zhu, Genfeng; Zhao, Guoping; Wang, Shengyue; Liu, Feng; Wang, Zhi-Qin; Zheng, Huajun; Wang, Shengyue; Han, Ze-Guang] Chinese Natl Human Genome Ctr Shanghai, Shanghai MOST Key Lab Hlth & Dis Genom, Shanghai 201203, Peoples R China; [Zhou, Yan; Zheng, Huajun; Jin, Ke; Dou, Tonghai; Hasegawa, Masami; Wang, Li; Zhang, Yuan; Zhou, Jie; Zhong, Yang; Zhao, Guoping; Liu, Feng; Zheng, Huajun] Fudan Univ, Sch Life Sci, Inst Biomed Sci, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China; [Wang, Li; Tao, Lin; Cao, Zhiwei; Li, Yixue; Zhong, Yang] Shanghai Ctr Bioinformat Technol, Shanghai 200235, Peoples R China; [Vinar, Tomas; Brejova, Brona; Brown, Dan; Li, Ming] Univ Waterloo, Cheriton Sch Comp Sci, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada; [Miller, David J.; Blair, David] James Cook Univ, Sch Trop Biol, Comparat Genom Ctr, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; [Chen, Zhu; Song, Huai-Dong; Chen, Saijuan; Lu, Gang] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Med, RuiJin Hosp, Shanghai Inst Hematol, Shanghai 200025, Peoples R China; [Chen, Zhu; Song, Huai-Dong; Chen, Saijuan; Lu, Gang] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, State Key Lab Med Genom, Shanghai 200025, Peoples R China; [Hu, Wei; Xu, Xuenian; Xu, Bin; Ju, Chuan; Huang, Yucheng; Feng, Zheng] Chinese Ctr Dis Control & Prevent, Natl Inst Parasit Dis, Shanghai 200025, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Qin-Hua; Zhang, Qin-hua] Shanghai Ctr Biochip Engn, Shanghai 201203, Peoples R China; [Brindley, Paul J.] George Washington Univ, Med Ctr, Dept Microbiol Immunol & Trop Med, Washington, DC 20037 USA; [McManus, Donald P.] Queensland Inst Med Res, Mol Parasitol Lab, Brisbane, Qld 4006, Australia; [Wang, Jun; Yu, Jun; Wang, Jian; Yang, Huanming] Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing Genom Inst, Beijing 101300, Peoples R China; [Ning, Zemin; Beriman, Matthew; Zhao, Guoping] Wellcome Trust Sanger Inst, Pathogen Sequencing Unit, Hinxton CB10 1SA, England; [Wei, Chia-Lin; Ruan, Yijun] Genome Inst Singapore, Singapore 138672, Singapore; [Zhao, Guoping] Chinese Acad Sci, Shanghai Inst Biol Sci, Shanghai 200031, Peoples R China","Zhou, Y (reprint author), Chinese Natl Human Genome Ctr Shanghai, Shanghai MOST Key Lab Hlth & Dis Genom, 250 Bi Bo Rd, Shanghai 201203, Peoples R China.",,"; Song, Huai-Dong/G-8961-2011; _, _/C-8514-2011; Vinar, Tomas/I-3695-2014; Wang, Jun/B-9503-2016; HU, Wei/F-1004-2012; Blair, David/G-6052-2011; Ning, Zemin/D-2411-2013; McManus, Donald/G-2678-2013; Wang, Jun/C-8434-2016; Brejova, Brona/I-3718-2014","Zhang, Bo/0000-0001-8890-8416; Vinar, Tomas/0000-0003-3898-3447; Wang, Jun/0000-0002-2113-5874; Ning, Zemin/0000-0003-4359-776X; Blair, David/0000-0002-4658-3251; Wang, Jun/0000-0002-8540-8931; Brejova, Brona/0000-0002-9483-1766","Chinese National High-Tech Program [2004AA2Z1010, 2006AA02Z335, 2006AA02Z318, 2007AA02Z153]; Chinese National Key Project for Basic Research [2006CB708510, 2007CB513100]; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Shanghai Municipal Commission for Science and Technology [04DZ14010, 055407031, 06JC14059, 07QA14043, 07DZ22915]; National Natural Science Foundation of China; US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases [AI39461]; National Science and Engineering Research Council of Canada [OGP0046506]; National Health and Medical Research Council of Australia; Wellcome Trust, UK","This investigation was mainly supported by the Chinese National High-Tech Program (863 Program) (2004AA2Z1010, 2006AA02Z335, 2006AA02Z318, 2007AA02Z153), the Chinese National Key Project for Basic Research (973 Project) (2006CB708510, 2007CB513100), the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the Shanghai Municipal Commission for Science and Technology (04DZ14010, 055407031, 06JC14059, 07QA14043, 07DZ22915), and the National Natural Science Foundation of China.

It encodes at least 11,809 genes, with an unusual intron size distribution, and new families of micro-exon genes that undergo frequent alternative splicing. As the first sequenced flatworm, and a representative of the Lophotrochozoa, it offers insights into early events in the evolution of the animals, including the development of a body pattern with bilateral symmetry, and the development of tissues into organs. Our analysis has been informed by the need to find new drug targets. The deficits in lipid metabolism that make schistosomes dependent on the host are revealed, and the identification of membrane receptors, ion channels and more than 300 proteases provide new insights into the biology of the life cycle and new targets. Bioinformatics approaches have identified metabolic chokepoints, and a chemogenomic screen has pinpointed schistosome proteins for which existing drugs may be active. The information generated provides an invaluable resource for the research community to develop much needed new control tools for the treatment and eradication of this important and neglected disease.","[Berriman, Matthew; Aslett, Martin A.; Eyre, Tina; Gamble, John A.; Gu, Yong; Hertz-Fowler, Christiane; Houston, Robin; Ivens, Alasdair; Parkhill, Julian; Protasio, Anna V.; Quail, Michael A.; Rajandream, Marie-Adele; Rogers, Jane; Tivey, Adrian R.; Barrell, Barclay G.] Wellcome Trust Sanger Inst, Cambridge CB10 1SD, England; [Coulson, Richard; Overington, John P.] European Bioinformat Inst EMBL, Cambridge CB10 1SD, England; [Haas, Brian J.; Bartholomeu, Daniella C.; Blandin, Gaelle; Djikeng, Appolinaire; Ghedin, Elodie; Lacerda, Daniela; White, Owen; Wortman, Jennifer; Fraser-Liggett, Claire M.; El-Sayed, Najib M.] J Craig Venter Inst, Inst Genom Res, Rockville, MD 20850 USA; [LoVerde, Philip T.; Ashton, Peter D.; Wu, Wenjie] Univ Texas Hlth Sci Ctr San Antonio, Dept Biochem, San Antonio, TX 78229 USA; [LoVerde, Philip T.; Ashton, Peter D.; Wu, Wenjie] Univ Texas Hlth Sci Ctr San Antonio, Dept Pathol, San Antonio, TX 78229 USA; [Wilson, R.

Here we address two longstanding enigmatic aspects of SOS mutagenesis, the molecular composition of mutagenically active pol V and the role of RecA*. We show that RecA* transfers a single RecA-ATP stoichiometrically from its DNA 39-end to free polV (UmuD'C-2) to form an active mutasome (polV Mut) with the composition UmuD'C-2-RecA-ATP. PolV Mut catalyses TLS in the absence of RecA* and deactivates rapidly upon dissociation from DNA. Deactivation occurs more slowly in the absence of DNA synthesis, while retaining RecA-ATP in the complex. Reactivation of polV Mut is triggered by replacement of RecA-ATP from RecA*. Thus, the principal role of RecA* in SOS mutagenesis is to transfer RecA-ATP to pol V, and thus generate active mutasomal complex for translesion synthesis.","[Jiang, Qingfei; Goodman, Myron F.] Univ So Calif, Dept Biol Sci, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA; [Jiang, Qingfei; Goodman, Myron F.] Univ So Calif, Dept Chem, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA; [Karata, Kiyonobu; Woodgate, Roger] NICHHD, Lab Genom Integr, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Cox, Michael M.] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Biochem, Madison, WI 53706 USA","Goodman, MF (reprint author), Univ So Calif, Dept Biol Sci, Univ Pk, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA.",mgoodman@usc.edu,"JIANG, QINGFEI/K-3492-2012",,"National Institutes of Health [ES12259, R37GM21422, GM32335]; NICHD/NIH","This work was supported by National Institutes of Health grants to M.

The standard model used to explain this assumes that most asteroids formed in situ from a primordial disk that experienced radical chemical changes within this zone(1). Here we show that the violent dynamical evolution of the giant-planet orbits required by the so-called Nice model(2-4) leads to the insertion of primitive trans-Neptunian objects into the outer belt. This result implies that the observed diversity of the asteroid belt is not a direct reflection of the intrinsic compositional variation of the proto-planetary disk. The dark captured bodies, composed of organic-rich materials, would have been more susceptible to collisional evolution than typical main-belt asteroids. Their weak nature makes them a prodigious source of micrometeorites-sufficient to explain why most are primitive in composition and are isotopically different from most macroscopic meteorites(5,6).","[Levison, Harold F.; Bottke, William F.; Nesvorny, David] SW Res Inst, Boulder, CO 80302 USA; [Levison, Harold F.; Bottke, William F.; Nesvorny, David] NASA, Lunar Sci Inst, Ctr Lunar Origin & Evolut, Boulder, CO 80302 USA; [Gounelle, Matthieu] CNRS, Lab Mineral & Cosmochim Museum, F-75005 Paris, France; [Gounelle, Matthieu] Museum Natl Hist Nat, F-75005 Paris, France; [Morbidelli, Alessandro] Observ Cote Azur, F-06304 Nice, France; [Tsiganis, Kleomenis] Aristotle Univ Thessaloniki, Dept Phys, Thessaloniki 54006, Greece","Levison, HF (reprint author), SW Res Inst, 1050 Walnut St,Suite 300, Boulder, CO 80302 USA.",hal@boulder.swri.edu,,,NASA's; S National Science Foundation's Astronomy Astrophysics; European Community,"H.

Such 3D photonic bandgap crystals are envisioned to become fundamental building blocks for the control and manipulation of photons in optical circuits. So far, such schemes have been pursued by embedding artificial defects(3-5,8-12) and light emitters(4-9) inside the crystals, making use of 3D bandgap directional effects. Here we show experimentally that photons can be controlled and manipulated even at the 'surface' of 3D photonic crystals, where 3D periodicity is terminated, establishing a new and versatile route for photon manipulation. By making use of an evanescent-mode coupling technique, we demonstrate that 3D photonic crystals possess two-dimensional surface states, and we map their band structure. We show that photons can be confined and propagate through these two-dimensional surface states, and we realize their localization at arbitrary surface points by designing artificial surface-defect structures through the formation of a surface-mode gap. Surprisingly, the quality factors of the surface-defect mode are the largest reported for 3D photonic crystal nanocavities (Q up to similar to 9,000). In addition to providing a new approach for photon manipulation by photonic crystals, our findings are relevant for the generation and control of plasmon-polaritons in metals and the related surface photon physics. The absorption-free nature of the 3D photonic crystal surface may enable new sensing applications and provide routes for the realization of efficient light-matter interactions.","[Ishizaki, Kenji; Noda, Susumu] Kyoto Univ, Dept Elect Sci & Engn, Kyoto 6158510, Japan; [Ishizaki, Kenji; Noda, Susumu] Japan Sci & Technol Agcy, Kyoto 6158510, Japan","Noda, S (reprint author), Kyoto Univ, Dept Elect Sci & Engn, Kyoto 6158510, Japan.",snoda@kuee.kyoto-u.ac.jp,,,"Global Centre of Excellence for Education and Research on Photonics and Electronics Science and Engineering of Kyoto University, Japan; Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology of Japan; Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS); JSPS","We thank Q.

Such positive photoconductance is observed in both bulk and nanostructured(5,6) photoconductors. Here we describe a class of nanoparticle-based materials whose conductivity can either increase or decrease on irradiation with visible light of wavelengths close to the particles' surface plasmon resonance. The remarkable feature of these plasmonic materials is that the sign of the conductivity change and the nature of the electron transport between the nanoparticles depend on the molecules comprising the self-assembled monolayers (SAMs)(7,8) stabilizing the nanoparticles. For SAMs made of electrically neutral (polar and non-polar) molecules, conductivity increases on irradiation. If, however, the SAMs contain electrically charged (either negatively or positively) groups, conductivity decreases. The optical and electrical characteristics of these previously undescribed inverse photoconductors can be engineered flexibly by adjusting the material properties of the nanoparticles and of the coating SAMs. In particular, in films comprising mixtures of different nanoparticles or nanoparticles coated with mixed SAMs, the overall photoconductance is a weighted average of the changes induced by the individual components. These and other observations can be rationalized in terms of light-induced creation of mobile charge carriers whose transport through the charged SAMs is inhibited by carrier trapping in transient polaron-like states(9,10). The nanoparticle-based photoconductors we describe could have uses in chemical sensors and/or in conjunction with flexible substrates.","[Nakanishi, Hideyuki; Kowalczyk, Bartlomiej; Nitzan, Abraham; Weiss, Emily A.; Apodaca, Mario M.; Stoddart, J.

However, because IRD can be transported by icebergs (derived from land-based ice) and also by sea ice(4), IRD records(2,3) are restricted to providing a history of general ice-rafting only. It is critical to differentiate sea ice from glacial (land-based) ice as climate feedback mechanisms vary and global impacts differ between these systems: sea ice directly affects ocean-atmosphere exchanges(5), whereas land-based ice affects sea level and consequently ocean acidity(6). An earlier report(3) assumed that sea ice was prevalent in the middle Eocene Arctic on the basis of IRD, and although somewhat preliminary supportive evidence exists(2), these data are neither comprehensive nor quantified. Here we show the presence of middle Eocene Arctic sea ice from an extraordinary abundance of a group of sea-ice-dependent fossil diatoms (Synedropsis spp.). Analysis of quartz grain textural characteristics further supports sea ice as the dominant transporter of IRD at this time. Together with new information on cosmopolitan diatoms and existing IRD records(2), our data strongly suggest a two-phase establishment of sea ice: initial episodic formation in marginal shelf areas similar to 47.5 Myr ago, followed similar to 0.5 Myr later by the onset of seasonally paced sea-ice formation in offshore areas of the central Arctic. Our data establish a 2-Myr record of sea ice, documenting the transition from a warm, ice-free(3) environment to one dominated by winter sea ice at the start of the middle Eocene climatic cooling phase(7).","[Stickley, Catherine E.; Koc, Nalan] Univ Tromso, Dept Geol, N-9037 Tromso, Norway; [St John, Kristen; Kearns, Lance E.] James Madison Univ, Dept Geog & Environm Sci, Harrisonburg, VA 22807 USA; [Stickley, Catherine E.; Koc, Nalan] Polar Environm Ctr, Norwegian Polar Inst, N-9296 Tromso, Norway; [Jordan, Richard W.] Yamagata Univ, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, Yamagata 9908560, Japan; [Passchier, Sandra] Montclair State Univ, Dept Earth & Environm Studies, Montclair, NJ 07043 USA; [Pearce, Richard B.] Univ Southampton, Southampton SO14 3ZH, Hants, England; [Pearce, Richard B.] Natl Oceanog Ctr, Southampton, Hants, England","Stickley, CE (reprint author), Univ Tromso, Dept Geol, N-9037 Tromso, Norway.",catherine.stickley@npolar.no,"Passchier, Sandra/B-1993-2008","Passchier, Sandra/0000-0001-7204-7025; Jordan, Richard/0000-0002-8997-7349",VISTA ( Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters and StatoilHydro); Research Council of Norway,"This research used samples and data provided by the Integrated Ocean Drilling Program (IODP).

But independent lines of evidence, such as the extent of Northern Hemisphere ice sheets(2), sea level(3) and other temperature records(4), point towards a fluctuating severity of glacial periods, particularly during the more extreme glacial stadials centred around 340,000 and 420,000 years ago (marine isotope stages 10 and 12). Previously unidentified mechanisms therefore appear to have mediated the relationship between insolation, CO2 and climate. Here we test whether northward migration of the subtropical front (STF) off the southeastern coast of South Africa acts as a gatekeeper for the Agulhas current(5,6), which controls the transport of heat and salt from the Indo-Pacific Ocean to the Atlantic Ocean. Using a new 800,000-year record of sea surface temperature and ocean productivity from ocean sediment core MD962077, we demonstrate that during cold stadials (particularly marine isotope stages 10 and 12), productivity peaked and sea surface temperature was up to 6 degrees C cooler than modern temperatures. This suggests that during these cooler stadials, the STF moved northward by up to 76 latitude, nearly shutting off the Agulhas current. Our results, combined with faunal assemblages from the south Atlantic(7,8) show that variable northwards migration of the Southern Hemisphere STF can modulate the severity of each glacial period by altering the strength of the Agulhas current carrying heat and salt to the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation. We show hence that the degree of northwards migration of the STF can partially decouple global climate from atmospheric partial pressure of carbon dioxide, p(CO2), and help to resolve the long-standing puzzle of differing glacial amplitudes within a consistent range of atmospheric p(CO2).","[Bard, Edouard] Univ Paul Cezanne Aix Marseille, CNRS, IRD, Coll France,CEREGE,UMR 6635, F-13545 Aix En Provence 4, France; [Rickaby, Rosalind E.

A neutral theory (assuming no environmental selection or organismal interactions) has been shown to predict many patterns of ecological biodiversity(2,3). This theory is based on a mechanism by which new species arise similarly to point mutations in a population without sexual reproduction. Here we report the simulation of populations with sexual reproduction, mutation and dispersal. We found simulated time dependence of speciation rates, species-area relationships and species abundance distributions consistent with the behaviours found in nature(1-13). From our results, we predict steady speciation rates, more species in one-dimensional environments than two-dimensional environments, three scaling regimes of species-area relationships and lognormal distributions of species abundance with an excess of rare species and a tail that may be approximated by Fisher's logarithmic series. These are consistent with dependences reported for, among others, global birds(4) and flowering plants(5), marine invertebrate fossils(6), ray-finned fishes(7), British birds(8,9) and moths(10), North American songbirds(11), mammal fossils from Kansas(12) and Panamanian shrubs(13). Quantitative comparisons of specific cases are remarkably successful. Our biodiversity results provide additional evidence that species diversity arises without specific physical barriers(6,11,14). This is similar to heavy traffic flows, where traffic jams can form even without accidents or barriers(15).","[de Aguiar, M. A.

Although a large amount of data has been amassed on primate ecology and behaviour, much less is known about the functional and evolutionary genetic aspects of primate biology, especially in wild primates. As a result, even in well-studied populations in which nongenetic factors that influence adaptively important characteristics have been identified, we have almost no understanding of the underlying genetic basis for such traits. Here, we report on the functional consequences of genetic variation at the malaria-related FY (DARC) gene in a well-studied population of yellow baboons (Papio cynocephalus) living in Amboseli National Park in Kenya. FY codes for a chemokine receptor normally expressed on the erythrocyte surface that is the known entry point for the malarial parasite Plasmodium vivax(1-3). We identified variation in the cis-regulatory region of the baboon FY gene that was associated with phenotypic variation in susceptibility to Hepatocystis, a malaria-like pathogen that is common in baboons(4,5). Genetic variation in this region also influenced gene expression in vivo in wild individuals, a result we confirmed using in vitro reporter gene assays. The patterns of genetic variation in and around this locus were also suggestive of non-neutral evolution, raising the possibility that the evolution of the FY cis-regulatory region in baboons has exhibited both mechanistic and selective parallels with the homologous region in humans(6-8). Together, our results represent the first reported association and functional characterization linking genetic variation and a complex trait in a natural population of nonhuman primates.","[Tung, Jenny; Primus, Alexander; Bouley, Andrew J.; Alberts, Susan C.; Wray, Gregory A.] Duke Univ, Dept Biol, Durham, NC 27708 USA; [Tung, Jenny; Primus, Alexander; Severson, Tonya F.; Alberts, Susan C.; Wray, Gregory A.] Duke Univ, Inst Genome Sci & Policy, Durham, NC 27708 USA; [Alberts, Susan C.; Wray, Gregory A.] Duke Univ, Dept Evolutionary Anthropol, Durham, NC 27708 USA; [Alberts, Susan C.] Natl Museums Kenya, Inst Primate Res, Nairobi, Kenya","Tung, J (reprint author), Duke Univ, Dept Biol, Durham, NC 27708 USA.",jt5@duke.edu,,,National Science Foundation; American Society of Primatologists; Duke University and the Duke chapter of Sigma Xi; Duke Institute for Genome Sciences and Policy,"We thank the Office of the President of the Republic of Kenya and the Kenya Wildlife Service for permission to work in Amboseli National Park, and the Institute of Primate Research for local sponsorship.

Here we report that rapamycin, an inhibitor of the mTOR pathway, extends median and maximal lifespan of both male and female mice when fed beginning at 600 days of age. On the basis of age at 90% mortality, rapamycin led to an increase of 14% for females and 9% for males. The effect was seen at three independent test sites in genetically heterogeneous mice, chosen to avoid genotype-specific effects on disease susceptibility. Disease patterns of rapamycin-treated mice did not differ from those of control mice. In a separate study, rapamycin fed to mice beginning at 270 days of age also increased survival in both males and females, based on an interim analysis conducted near the median survival point. Rapamycin may extend lifespan by postponing death from cancer, by retarding mechanisms of ageing, or both. To our knowledge, these are the first results to demonstrate a role for mTOR signalling in the regulation of mammalian lifespan, as well as pharmacological extension of lifespan in both genders. These findings have implications for further development of interventions targeting mTOR for the treatment and prevention of age-related diseases.","[Harrison, David E.; Astle, Clinton M.; Flurkey, Kevin] Jackson Lab, Bar Harbor, ME 04609 USA; [Strong, Randy; Fernandez, Elizabeth] Univ Texas Hlth Sci Ctr San Antonio, Ctr Geriatr Res Educ & Clin, San Antonio, TX 78229 USA; [Strong, Randy; Fernandez, Elizabeth] Univ Texas Hlth Sci Ctr San Antonio, Res Serv, Dept Pharmacol, San Antonio, TX 78229 USA; [Strong, Randy; Sharp, Zelton Dave; Nelson, James F.; Fernandez, Elizabeth] Univ Texas Hlth Sci Ctr San Antonio, Barshop Inst Longev & Aging Studies, San Antonio, TX 78229 USA; [Sharp, Zelton Dave] Univ Texas Hlth Sci Ctr San Antonio, Inst Biotechnol, Dept Mol Med, San Antonio, TX 78245 USA; [Nelson, James F.] Univ Texas Hlth Sci Ctr San Antonio, Dept Physiol, San Antonio, TX 78229 USA; [Nadon, Nancy L.] NIA, Div Aging Biol, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Wilkinson, J.

Here we show a role for the HECT (homologous to E6AP carboxy terminus) E3 ubiquitin ligase WWP-1 as a positive regulator of lifespan in Caenorhabditis elegans in response to dietary restriction. We find that overexpression of wwp-1 in worms extends lifespan by up to 20% under conditions of ad libitum feeding. This extension is dependent on the FOXA transcription factor pha-4, and independent of the FOXO transcription factor daf-16. Reduction of wwp-1 completely suppresses the extended longevity of diet-restricted animals. However, the loss of wwp-1 does not affect the long lifespan of animals with compromised mitochondrial function or reduced insulin/IGF-1 signalling. Overexpression of a mutant form of WWP-1 lacking catalytic activity suppresses the increased lifespan of diet-restricted animals, indicating that WWP-1 ubiquitin ligase activity is essential for longevity. Furthermore, we find that the E2 ubiquitin conjugating enzyme, UBC-18, is essential and specific for diet-restriction-induced longevity. UBC-18 interacts with WWP-1 and is required for the ubiquitin ligase activity of WWP-1 and the extended longevity of worms overexpressing wwp-1. Taken together, our results indicate that WWP-1 and UBC-18 function to ubiquitinate substrates that regulate diet-restriction-induced longevity.","[Carrano, Andrea C.; Liu, Zheng; Dillin, Andrew; Hunter, Tony] Salk Inst Biol Studies, Mol & Cell Biol Lab, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; [Liu, Zheng; Dillin, Andrew] Salk Inst Biol Studies, Howard Hughes Med Inst, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; [Liu, Zheng; Dillin, Andrew] Glenn Ctr Aging Res, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA","Dillin, A (reprint author), Salk Inst Biol Studies, Mol & Cell Biol Lab, 10010 N Torrey Pines Rd, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA.",Dillin@salk.edu,"Liu, Zheng/E-6302-2012","Liu, Zheng/0000-0002-7968-3849","National Institutes of Health (NIH) National Center for Research Resources (NCRR); National Cancer Institute [CA 14195, CA 54418, CA 82683]; National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases [DK 070696]; National Institute on Aging [AG 027463, AG 032560]; Ellison Medical and Glenn Medical Foundations; American Cancer Society","We thank members of the Dillin laboratory for discussion, and P.

In extreme cases, the hands or fingers are attached directly to the shoulder and the most proximal elements (those closest to the shoulder) are entirely missing. This disorder, previously known in both autosomal recessive and sporadic forms, showed a marked increase in incidence in the early 1960s due to the tragic toxicological effects of the drug thalidomide, which had been prescribed as a mild sedative(1,2). This human birth defect is mimicked in developing chick limb buds exposed to X-irradiation(3-5). Both X-irradiation(5) and thalidomide-induced phocomelia(5,6) have been interpreted as patterning defects in the context of the progress zone model, which states that a cell's proximodistal identity is determined by the length of time spent in a distal limb region termed the 'progress zone'(7). Indeed, studies of X-irradiation-induced phocomelia have served as one of the two major experimental lines of evidence supporting the validity of the progress zone model. Here, using a combination of molecular analysis and lineage tracing in chick, we show that X-irradiation-induced phocomelia is fundamentally not a patterning defect, but rather results from a time-dependent loss of skeletal progenitors. Because skeletal condensation proceeds from the shoulder to fingers (in a proximal to distal direction), the proximal elements are differentially affected in limb buds exposed to radiation at early stages. This conclusion changes the framework for considering the effect of thalidomide and other forms of phocomelia, suggesting the possibility that the aetiology lies not in a defect in the patterning process, but rather in progenitor cell survival and differentiation. Moreover, molecular evidence that proximodistal patterning is unaffected after X-irradiation does not support the predictions of the progress zone model.","[Galloway, Jenna L.; Tabin, Clifford J.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Genet, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Delgado, Irene] Univ Cantabria, Dept Anat & Biol Celular, E-39005 Santander, Spain; [Ros, Maria A.] CSIC UC IDICAN, Inst Biomed & Biotecnol Cantabria, Santander 39005, Spain","Tabin, CJ (reprint author), Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Genet, 77 Ave Louis Pasteur, Boston, MA 02115 USA.",tabin@receptor.med.harvard.edu,"Ros, Maria /K-8160-2014; Delgado, Irene/L-9424-2014","Ros, Maria /0000-0002-1224-7671; Delgado, Irene/0000-0002-0493-8261",NIH [R37 HD032443]; National Institute of Child Health and Human Development [F32HD057701]; Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation [BFU2008-00397],"We would like to thank J.

Many AP-1 proteins contain defined transcriptional activation domains, but BATF and the closely related BATF3 (refs 2, 3) contain only a basic region and leucine zipper, and are considered to be inhibitors of AP-1 activity(3-8). Here we show that Batf is required for the differentiation of IL17-producing T helper (T(H)17) cells(9). T(H)17 cells comprise a CD4(+) T-cell subset that coordinates inflammatory responses in host defence but is pathogenic in autoimmunity(10-13). Batf(-/-) mice have normal T(H)1 and T(H)2 differentiation, but show a defect in T(H)17 differentiation, and are resistant to experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. Batf(-/-) T cells fail to induce known factors required for T(H)17 differentiation, such as ROR gamma t(11) (encoded by Rorc) and the cytokine IL21 (refs 14-17). Neither the addition of IL21 nor the overexpression of ROR gamma t fully restores IL17 production in Batf(-/-) T cells. The Il17 promoter is BATF-responsive, and after T(H)17 differentiation, BATF binds conserved intergenic elements in the Il17a-Il17f locus and to the Il17, Il21 and Il22 (ref. 18) promoters. These results demonstrate that the AP-1 protein BATF has a critical role in T(H)17 differentiation.","[Schraml, Barbara U.; Hildner, Kai; Ise, Wataru; Lee, Wan-Ling; Smith, Whitney A. -E.; Solomon, Ben; Cemerski, Saso; Murphy, Theresa L.; Murphy, Kenneth M.] Washington Univ, Sch Med, Dept Pathol & Immunol, St Louis, MO 63110 USA; [Hildner, Kai; Ise, Wataru; Murphy, Kenneth M.] Washington Univ, Sch Med, Howard Hughes Med Inst, St Louis, MO 63110 USA; [Sahota, Gurmukh; Stormo, Gary D.] Washington Univ, Sch Med, Dept Genet, St Louis, MO 63110 USA; [Sim, Julia; Russell, John H.] Washington Univ, Sch Med, Dept Mol Biol & Pharmacol, St Louis, MO 63110 USA; [Mukasa, Ryuta; Hatton, Robin D.; Weaver, Casey T.] Univ Alabama, Dept Pathol, Birmingham, AL 35294 USA","Murphy, KM (reprint author), Washington Univ, Sch Med, Dept Pathol & Immunol, 660 S Euclid Ave, St Louis, MO 63110 USA.",kmurphy@wustl.edu,"Stormo, Gary/C-5367-2013","Stormo, Gary/0000-0001-6896-1850; Weaver, Casey/0000-0002-2180-1793; Russell, John/0000-0002-3680-9587; Solomon, Benjamin/0000-0003-1009-7312; Hatton, Robin/0000-0002-4797-9899","Howard Hughes Medical Institute; National Institutes of Health [HG00249, GM07200, AI035783, AR049293]; Daiichi-Sankyo Co.

In addition, evidence from model organisms(3-6) and from human genetics(7) suggests that cohesin is involved in the control of gene expression(8,9). This non-canonical role has recently been rationalized by the findings that mammalian cohesin complexes are recruited to a subset of DNase I hypersensitive sites and to conserved noncoding sequences by the DNA-binding protein CTCF(10-13). CTCF functions at insulators (which control interactions between enhancers and promoters) and at boundary elements (which demarcate regions of distinct chromatin structure)(14), and cohesin contributes to its enhancer-blocking activity(10,11). The underlying mechanisms remain unknown, and the full spectrum of cohesin functions remains to be determined. Here we show that cohesin forms the topological and mechanistic basis for cell-type-specific long-range chromosomal interactions in cis at the developmentally regulated cytokine locus IFNG. Hence, the ability of cohesin to constrain chromosome topology is used not only for the purpose of sister chromatid cohesion(1,2), but also to dynamically define the spatial conformation of specific loci. This new aspect of cohesin function is probably important for normal development(3-6) and disease(7).","[Hadjur, Suzana; Williams, Luke M.; Ryan, Natalie K.; Cobb, Bradley S.; Fisher, Amanda G.; Merkenschlager, Matthias] Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, MRC Clin Sci Ctr, Lymphocyte Dev Grp, London W12 0NN, England; [Sexton, Tom; Fraser, Peter] Babraham Inst, Lab Chromatin & Gene Express, Cambridge CB2 4AT, England","Merkenschlager, M (reprint author), Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, MRC Clin Sci Ctr, Lymphocyte Dev Grp, Cane Rd, London W12 0NN, England.",matthias.merkenschlager@csc.mrc.ac.uk,"Fraser, Peter/B-7549-2009","Merkenschlager, Matthias/0000-0003-2889-3288; Fraser, Peter/0000-0002-0041-1227; Sexton, Thomas/0000-0002-7824-1846","Medical Research Council, UK","We thank M.

In analogy to classical Pavlovian conditioning, microorganisms may have evolved to anticipate environmental stimuli by adapting to their temporal order of appearance. Here we present evidence for environmental change anticipation in two model microorganisms, Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We show that anticipation is an adaptive trait, because pre-exposure to the stimulus that typically appears early in the ecology improves the organism's fitness when encountered with a second stimulus. Additionally, we observe loss of the conditioned response in E. coli strains that were repeatedly exposed in a laboratory evolution experiment only to the first stimulus. Focusing on the molecular level reveals that the natural temporal order of stimuli is embedded in the wiring of the regulatory network-early stimuli pre-induce genes that would be needed for later ones, yet later stimuli only induce genes needed to cope with them. Our work indicates that environmental anticipation is an adaptive trait that was repeatedly selected for during evolution and thus may be ubiquitous in biology.","[Mitchell, Amir; Groisman, Bella; Yona, Avihu; Dahan, Orna; Pilpel, Yitzhak] Weizmann Inst Sci, Dept Mol Genet, IL-76100 Rehovot, Israel; [Romano, Gal H.; Kupiec, Martin] Tel Aviv Univ, Dept Mol Microbiol & Biotechnol, IL-69978 Tel Aviv, Israel; [Dekel, Erez] Weizmann Inst Sci, Dept Mol Cell Biol, IL-76100 Rehovot, Israel; [Pilpel, Yitzhak] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Syst Biol, Boston, MA 02115 USA","Pilpel, Y (reprint author), Weizmann Inst Sci, Dept Mol Genet, IL-76100 Rehovot, Israel.",pilpel@weizmann.ac.il,,,Tauber Foundation; Minerva Foundation; Israel Science Foundation; European Research Council; Ben May Foundation; Israeli Ministry of Science and Technology,"We thank S.

Most blindness in AMD results from invasion of the retina by choroidal neovascularisation (CNV). Here we show that the eosinophil/mast cell chemokine receptor CCR3 is specifically expressed in choroidal neovascular endothelial cells in humans with AMD, and that despite the expression of its ligands eotaxin-1, -2 and -3, neither eosinophils nor mast cells are present in human CNV. Genetic or pharmacological targeting of CCR3 or eotaxins inhibited injury-induced CNV in mice. CNV suppression by CCR3 blockade was due to direct inhibition of endothelial cell proliferation, and was uncoupled from inflammation because it occurred in mice lacking eosinophils or mast cells, and was independent of macrophage and neutrophil recruitment. CCR3 blockade was more effective at reducing CNV than vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A) neutralization, which is in clinical use at present, and, unlike VEGF-A blockade, is not toxic to the mouse retina. In vivo imaging with CCR3-targeting quantum dots located spontaneous CNV invisible to standard fluorescein angiography in mice before retinal invasion. CCR3 targeting might reduce vision loss due to AMD through early detection and therapeutic angioinhibition.","[Takeda, Atsunobu; Baffi, Judit Z.; Kleinman, Mark E.; Cho, Won Gil; Nozaki, Miho; Yamada, Kiyoshi; Kaneko, Hiroki; Albuquerque, Romulo J.

Both processes use directed DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) repaired by non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ). Errors in either V(D) J recombination or CSR can initiate chromosomal translocations, including oncogenic IgH locus (Igh) to c-myc (also known as Myc) translocations of peripheral B cell lymphomas. Collaboration between these processes has also been proposed to initiate translocations. However, the occurrence of V(D) J recombination in peripheral B cells is controversial. Here we show that activated NHEJ-deficient splenic B cells accumulate V(D) J-recombination-associated breaks at the lambda IgL locus (Igl), as well as CSR-associated Igh breaks, often in the same cell. Moreover, Igl and Igh breaks are frequently joined to form translocations, a phenomenon associated with specific Igh-Igl co-localization. Igh and c-myc also co-localize in these cells; correspondingly, the introduction of frequent c-myc DSBs robustly promotes Igh-c-myc translocations. Our studies show peripheral B cells that attempt secondary V(D) J recombination, and determine a role for mechanistic factors in promoting recurrent translocations in tumours.","[Wang, Jing H.; Gostissa, Monica; Yan, Catherine T.; Goff, Peter; Hickernell, Thomas; Hansen, Erica; Wesemann, Duane R.; Zarrin, Ali A.; Alt, Frederick W.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Wang, Jing H.; Gostissa, Monica; Yan, Catherine T.; Goff, Peter; Hickernell, Thomas; Hansen, Erica; Wesemann, Duane R.; Zarrin, Ali A.; Alt, Frederick W.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Childrens Hosp, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Wang, Jing H.; Gostissa, Monica; Yan, Catherine T.; Goff, Peter; Hickernell, Thomas; Hansen, Erica; Wesemann, Duane R.; Zarrin, Ali A.; Rajewsky, Klaus; Alt, Frederick W.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Immune Dis Inst, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Wang, Jing H.; Gostissa, Monica; Yan, Catherine T.; Goff, Peter; Hickernell, Thomas; Hansen, Erica; Wesemann, Duane R.; Zarrin, Ali A.; Alt, Frederick W.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Genet, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Difilippantonio, Simone; Nussenzweig, Andre] NCI, Expt Immunol Branch, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Wesemann, Duane R.] Brigham & Womens Hosp, Dept Med, Div Rheumatol Allergy & Immunol, Boston, MA 02115 USA","Alt, FW (reprint author), Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Boston, MA 02115 USA.",alt@enders.tch.harvard.edu,"Wang, Jing/M-7813-2015","Wang, Jing/0000-0003-4343-2527; Rajewsky, Klaus/0000-0002-6633-6370",National Insitutes of Health (NIH) [5P01CA92625]; Leukemia and Lymphoma Society of America (LLS) SCORE; NCI,"We thank Alt laboratory members for discussions, and Y.

The subclass type IIn (ref. 6) supernovae are luminous(7-9) core-collapse explosions of massive stars(8-11) and, unlike other types, are very bright in the ultraviolet(12-15), which should enable them to be found optically at redshifts z approximate to 2 and higher(14,16). In addition, the interaction of the ejecta with circumstellar material creates strong, long-lived emission lines that allow spectroscopic confirmation of many events of this type at z approximate to 2 for 3-5 years after explosion (ref. 14). Here we report three spectroscopically confirmed type IIn supernovae, at redshifts z = 0.808, 2.013 and 2.357, detected in archival data using a method(14) designed to exploit these properties at z approximate to 2. Type IIn supernovae directly probe the formation of massive stars at high redshift.

A quantum processor executes algorithms by applying a programmable sequence of gates to an initialized register of qubits, which coherently evolves into a final state containing the result of the computation. Building a quantum processor is challenging because of the need to meet simultaneously requirements that are in conflict: state preparation, long coherence times, universal gate operations and qubit readout. Processors based on a few qubits have been demonstrated using nuclear magnetic resonance(3-5), cold ion trap(6,7) and optical(8) systems, but a solid-state realization has remained an outstanding challenge. Here we demonstrate a two-qubit superconducting processor and the implementation of the Grover search and Deutsch-Jozsa quantum algorithms(1,2). We use a two-qubit interaction, tunable in strength by two orders of magnitude on nanosecond timescales, which is mediated by a cavity bus in a circuit quantum electrodynamics architecture(9,10). This interaction allows the generation of highly entangled states with concurrence up to 94 per cent. Although this processor constitutes an important step in quantum computing with integrated circuits, continuing efforts to increase qubit coherence times, gate performance and register size will be required to fulfil the promise of a scalable technology.","[DiCarlo, L.; Chow, J.

For many years, attempts have been made to directly measure correlations in the individual photon emission events of semiconductor lasers(2,3). Previously, the temporal decay of these correlations below or at the lasing threshold was considerably faster than could be measured with the time resolution provided by the Hanbury Brown/Twiss measurement set-up(4) used. Here we demonstrate a measurement technique using a streak camera that overcomes this limitation and provides a record of the arrival times of individual photons. This allows us to investigate the dynamical evolution of correlations between the individual photon emission events. We apply our studies to micropillar lasers(5) with semiconductor quantum dots(2,3,6-8) as the active material, operating in the regime of cavity quantum electrodynamics(9). For laser resonators with a low cavity quality factor, Q, a smooth transition from photon bunching to uncorrelated emission with increasing pumping is observed; for high-Q resonators, we see a non-monotonic dependence around the threshold where quantum light emission can occur. We identify regimes of dynamical anti-bunching of photons in agreement with the predictions of a microscopic theory that includes semiconductor-specific effects.","[Wiersig, J.; Gies, C.; Jahnke, F.; Kruse, C.; Kalden, J.; Hommel, D.] Univ Bremen, Dept Phys, D-28334 Bremen, Germany; [Assmann, M.; Berstermann, T.; Bayer, M.] Tech Univ Dortmund, D-44221 Dortmund, Germany; [Kistner, C.; Reitzenstein, S.; Schneider, C.; Hoefling, S.; Forchel, A.] Univ Wurzburg, D-97074 Wurzburg, Germany","Jahnke, F (reprint author), Univ Bremen, Dept Phys, D-28334 Bremen, Germany.",jahnke@itp.uni-bremen.de; manfred.bayer@tu-dortmund.de,"Kalden, Joachim/E-6911-2011; Wiersig, Jan/F-1410-2013; Reitzenstein, Stephan/A-9184-2014; Hofling, Sven/C-3140-2013","Kalden, Joachim/0000-0003-4694-7913; Hofling, Sven/0000-0003-0034-4682; Forchel, Alfred/0000-0002-9377-9935; Assmann, Marc-Alexander/0000-0003-4953-1286; Wiersig, Jan/0000-0003-2764-1660",Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft,We would like to thank P.

Many fundamental studies and technological applications(2) of SWNTs require a population of tubes with identical chirality that current syntheses cannot provide. The SWNT sorting problem-that is, separation of a synthetic mixture of tubes into individual single-chirality components-has attracted considerable attention in recent years. Intense efforts so far have focused largely on, and resulted in solutions for, a weaker version of the sorting problem: metal/semiconductor separation(3,4). A systematic and general method to purify each and every single-chirality species of the same electronic type from the synthetic mixture of SWNTs is highly desirable, but the task has proven to be insurmountable to date. Here we report such a method, which allows purification of all 12 major single-chirality semiconducting species from a synthetic mixture, with sufficient yield for both fundamental studies and application development. We have designed an effective search of a DNA library of similar to 10(60) in size, and have identified more than 20 short DNA sequences, each of which recognizes and enables chromatographic purification of a particular nanotube species from the synthetic mixture. Recognition sequences exhibit a periodic purine-pyrimidines pattern, which can undergo hydrogen-bonding to form a two-dimensional sheet, and fold selectively on nanotubes into a well-ordered three-dimensional barrel. We propose that the ordered two-dimensional sheet and three-dimensional barrel provide the structural basis for the observed DNA recognition of SWNTs.","[Tu, Xiaomin; Zheng, Ming] DuPont Co Inc, Cent Res & Dev, Wilmington, DE 19880 USA; [Manohar, Suresh; Jagota, Anand] Lehigh Univ, Dept Chem Engn, Bethlehem, PA 18015 USA; [Jagota, Anand] Lehigh Univ, Bioengn Program, Bethlehem, PA 18015 USA","Zheng, M (reprint author), DuPont Co Inc, Cent Res & Dev, Wilmington, DE 19880 USA.",ming.zheng@usa.dupont.com,,,US National Science Foundation [CMS-060950],This work was supported in part by the US National Science Foundation (grant CMS-060950).

Little is known of the state of the Arctic Ocean in the greenhouse period of the Late Cretaceous epoch (65-99 million years ago), yet records from such times may yield important clues to Arctic Ocean behaviour in near-future warmer climates. Here we present a seasonally resolved Cretaceous sedimentary record from the Alpha ridge of the Arctic Ocean. This palaeo-sediment trap provides new insight into the workings of the Cretaceous marine biological carbon pump. Seasonal primary production was dominated by diatom algae but was not related to upwelling as was previously hypothesized(2). Rather, production occurred within a stratified water column, involving specially adapted species in blooms resembling those of the modern North Pacific subtropical gyre(3), or those indicated for the Mediterranean sapropels(4). With increased CO2 levels and warming currently driving increased stratification in the global ocean(5), this style of production that is adapted to stratification may become more widespread. Our evidence for seasonal diatom production and flux testify to an ice-free summer, but thin accumulations of terrigenous sediment within the diatom ooze are consistent with the presence of intermittent sea ice in the winter, supporting a wide body of evidence for low temperatures in the Late Cretaceous Arctic Ocean(6-8), rather than recent suggestions of a 15 degrees C mean annual temperature at this time(9).","[Davies, Andrew; Kemp, Alan E.

Adult bone marrow also contains adipocytes, the number of which correlates inversely with the haematopoietic activity of the marrow. Fatty infiltration of haematopoietic red marrow follows irradiation or chemotherapy and is a diagnostic feature in biopsies from patients with marrow aplasia(4). To explore whether adipocytes influence haematopoiesis or simply fill marrow space, we compared the haematopoietic activity of distinct regions of the mouse skeleton that differ in adiposity. Here we show, by flow cytometry, colony-forming activity and competitive repopulation assay, that haematopoietic stem cells and short-term progenitors are reduced in frequency in the adipocyte-rich vertebrae of the mouse tail relative to the adipocyte-free vertebrae of the thorax. In lipoatrophic A-ZIP/F1 'fatless' mice, which are genetically incapable of forming adipocytes(5), and in mice treated with the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-c inhibitor bisphenol A diglycidyl ether, which inhibits adipogenesis(6), marrow engraftment after irradiation is accelerated relative to wild-type or untreated mice. These data implicate adipocytes as predominantly negative regulators of the bone-marrow microenvironment, and indicate that antagonizing marrow adipogenesis may enhance haematopoietic recovery in clinical bone-marrow transplantation.","[Naveiras, Olaia; Nardi, Valentina; Wenzel, Pamela L.; Daley, George Q.] Childrens Hosp, Div Pediat Hematol Oncol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Naveiras, Olaia; Nardi, Valentina; Wenzel, Pamela L.; Daley, George Q.] Dana Farber Canc Inst, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Naveiras, Olaia; Nardi, Valentina; Wenzel, Pamela L.; Daley, George Q.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Biol Chem & Mol Pharmacol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Naveiras, Olaia; Nardi, Valentina; Wenzel, Pamela L.; Daley, George Q.] Brigham & Womens Hosp, Div Hematol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Naveiras, Olaia; Nardi, Valentina; Wenzel, Pamela L.; Daley, George Q.] Harvard Univ, Stem Cell Inst, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Naveiras, Olaia; Nardi, Valentina; Wenzel, Pamela L.; Daley, George Q.] Howard Hughes Med Inst, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Naveiras, Olaia; Nardi, Valentina; Wenzel, Pamela L.; Daley, George Q.] Manton Ctr Orphan Dis, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Hauschka, Peter V.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Orthopaed Surg, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Hauschka, Peter V.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Oral & Dev Biol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Hauschka, Peter V.] Harvard Univ, Sch Dent Med, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Fahey, Frederic] Harvard Univ, Childrens Hosp, Sch Med, Dept Radiol,Div Nucl Med PET, Boston, MA 02115 USA","Daley, GQ (reprint author), Childrens Hosp, Div Pediat Hematol Oncol, 300 Longwood Ave, Boston, MA 02115 USA.",george.daley@childrens.harvard.edu,"Wenzel, Pamela/A-2992-2010","Wenzel, Pamela L./0000-0002-4530-015X; Naveiras, Olaia/0000-0003-3434-0022",Barrie de la Maza Foundation; National Institutes of Health (NIH) [T32-HL-7623]; Burroughs Wellcome Fund; Leukemia and Lymphoma Society,"We thank S.

Individual TLRs recruit diverse combinations of adaptor proteins, triggering signal transduction pathways and leading to the activation of various transcription factors, including nuclear factor kappa B, activation protein 1 and interferon regulatory factors(2). Interleukin-2 is one of the molecules produced by mouse dendritic cells after stimulation by different pattern recognition receptor agonists(3-6). By analogy with the events after T-cell receptor engagement leading to interleukin-2 production, it is therefore plausible that the stimulation of TLRs on dendritic cells may lead to activation of the Ca(2+)/calcineurin and NFAT (nuclear factor of activated T cells) pathway. Here we show that mouse dendritic cell stimulation with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induces Src-family kinase and phospholipase C gamma 2 activation, influx of extracellular Ca(2+) and calcineurin-dependent nuclear NFAT translocation. The initiation of this pathway is independent of TLR4 engagement, and dependent exclusively on CD14. We also show that LPS-induced NFAT activation via CD14 is necessary to cause the apoptotic death of terminally differentiated dendritic cells, an event that is essential for maintaining self-tolerance and preventing autoimmunity(7,8). Consequently, blocking this pathway in vivo causes prolonged dendritic cell survival and an increase in T-cell priming capability. Our findings reveal novel aspects of molecular signalling triggered by LPS in dendritic cells, and identify a new role for CD14: the regulation of the dendritic cell life cycle through NFAT activation. Given the involvement of CD14 in disease, including sepsis and chronic heart failure(9,10), the discovery of signal transduction pathways activated exclusively via CD14 is an important step towards the development of potential treatments involving interference with CD14 functions.","[Zanoni, Ivan; Ostuni, Renato; Capuano, Giusy; Ronchi, Antonella Ellena; Rocchetti, Marcella; Mingozzi, Francesca; Foti, Maria; Costa, Barbara; Zaza, Antonio; Ricciardi-Castagnoli, Paola; Granucci, Francesca] Univ Milano Bicocca, Dept Biosci & Biotechnol, I-20126 Milan, Italy; [Collini, Maddalena; Caccia, Michele; Chirico, Giuseppe] Univ Milano Bicocca, Dept Phys, I-20126 Milan, Italy","Granucci, F (reprint author), Univ Milano Bicocca, Dept Biosci & Biotechnol, Piazza Sci 2, I-20126 Milan, Italy.",francesca.granucci@unimib.it,"Castagnoli, Paola/E-8288-2010","Ostuni, Renato/0000-0003-0460-3426; ZAZA, ANTONIO/0000-0001-9355-4958; granucci, francesca/0000-0002-7046-4914; Zanoni, Ivan/0000-0002-3423-7474",CARIPLO Foundation; European Commission; Associazione Italiana per la Ricerca sul Cancro (AIRC); Italian Ministry of Education and Research (COFIN),"We thank S.

The inflammatory response must be actively terminated, however, because failure to do so can result in 'bystander' damage to tissues and diseases such as arthritis or type-2 diabetes. Yet the mechanisms controlling excessive inflammatory responses are still poorly understood. Here we show that mouse effector and memory CD4(+) T cells abolish macrophage inflammasome-mediated caspase-1 activation and subsequent interleukin 1 beta release in a cognate manner. Inflammasome inhibition is observed for all tested NLRP1 (commonly called NALP1) and NLRP3 (NALP3 or cryopyrin) activators, whereas NLRC4 (IPAF) inflammasome function and release of other inflammatory mediators such as CXCL2, interleukin 6 and tumour necrosis factor are not affected. Suppression of the NLRP3 inflammasome requires cell-to-cell contact and can be mimicked by macrophage stimulation with selected ligands of the tumour necrosis factor family, such as CD40L (also known as CD40LG). In a NLRP3-dependent peritonitis model, effector CD4(+) T cells are responsible for decreasing neutrophil recruitment in an antigen-dependent manner. Our findings reveal an unexpected mechanism of inflammasome inhibition, whereby effector and memory T cells suppress potentially damaging inflammation, yet leave the primary inflammatory response, crucial for the onset of immunity, intact.","[Guarda, Greta; Dostert, Catherine; Staehli, Francesco; Cabalzar, Katrin; Castillo, Rosa; Tardivel, Aubry; Schneider, Pascal; Tschopp, Juerg] Univ Lausanne, Dept Biochem, CH-1066 Epalinges, Switzerland","Tschopp, J (reprint author), Univ Lausanne, Dept Biochem, Chemim Boveresses 155, CH-1066 Epalinges, Switzerland.",jurg.tschopp@unil.ch,"Staehli, Francesco/B-1350-2009; Guarda, Greta/G-1921-2011","Schneider, Pascal/0000-0003-0677-9409; Guarda, Greta/0000-0001-9243-6116",Swiss National Science foundation; NCCR Molecular Oncology; EMBO,"We thank H.

The number of phosphorylated sites on a protein (n) shows a significant increase from prokaryotes, with n <= 7 sites, to eukaryotes, with examples having n >= 150 sites(3). Multisite phosphorylation has many roles(4,5) and site conservation indicates that increasing numbers of sites cannot be due merely to promiscuous phosphorylation. A substrate with n sites has an exponential number (2(n)) of phospho-forms and individual phospho-forms may have distinct biological effects(6,7). The distribution of these phospho-forms and how this distribution is regulated have remained unknown. Here we show that, when kinase and phosphatase act in opposition on a multisite substrate, the system can exhibit distinct stable phospho-form distributions at steady state and that the maximum number of such distributions increases with n. Whereas some stable distributions are focused on a single phospho-form, others are more diffuse, giving the phosphoproteome the potential to behave as a fluid regulatory network able to encode information and flexibly respond to varying demands. Such plasticity may underlie complex information processing in eukaryotic cells(8) and suggests a functional advantage in having many sites. Our results follow from the unusual geometry of the steady-state phospho-form concentrations, which we show to constitute a rational algebraic curve, irrespective of n. We thereby reduce the complexity of calculating steady states from simulating 3 x 2(n) differential equations to solving two algebraic equations, while treating parameters symbolically. We anticipate that these methods can be extended to systems with multiple substrates and multiple enzymes catalysing different modifications, as found in posttranslational modification 'codes'(9) such as the histone code(10,11). Whereas simulations struggle with exponentially increasing molecular complexity, mathematical methods of the kind developed here can provide a new language in which to articulate the principles of cellular information processing(12).","[Gunawardena, Jeremy] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Syst Biol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Thomson, Matthew] Harvard Univ, Biophys Program, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA","Gunawardena, J (reprint author), Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Syst Biol, Boston, MA 02115 USA.",jeremy@hms.harvard.edu,,,NIH [R01-GM081578],"This work was supported in part by the NIH under grant R01-GM081578.

However, a direct mechanistic link between extra centrosomes and CIN has not been established. It has been proposed that extra centrosomes generate CIN by promoting multipolar anaphase, a highly abnormal division that produces three or more aneuploid daughter cells. Here we use long-term live-cell imaging to demonstrate that cells with multiple centrosomes rarely undergo multipolar cell divisions, and the progeny of these divisions are typically inviable. Thus, multipolar divisions cannot explain observed rates of CIN. In contrast, we observe that CIN cells with extra centrosomes routinely undergo bipolar cell divisions, but display a significantly increased frequency of lagging chromosomes during anaphase. To define the mechanism underlying this mitotic defect, we generated cells that differ only in their centrosome number. We demonstrate that extra centrosomes alone are sufficient to promote chromosome missegregation during bipolar cell division. These segregation errors are a consequence of cells passing through a transient 'multipolar spindle intermediate' in which merotelic kinetochore-microtubule attachment errors accumulate before centrosome clustering and anaphase. These findings provide a direct mechanistic link between extra centrosomes and CIN, two common characteristics of solid tumours. We propose that this mechanism may be a common underlying cause of CIN in human cancer.","[Ganem, Neil J.; Godinho, Susana A.; Pellman, David] Harvard Univ, Sch Med,Dept Pediat Oncol, Dana Farber Canc Inst,Dept Cell Biol, Howard Hughes Med Inst,Childrens Hosp, Boston, MA 02115 USA","Pellman, D (reprint author), Harvard Univ, Sch Med,Dept Pediat Oncol, Dana Farber Canc Inst,Dept Cell Biol, Howard Hughes Med Inst,Childrens Hosp, 44 Binney St, Boston, MA 02115 USA.",david_pellman@dfci.harvard.edu,,,Leukemia and Lymphoma Society; NIH [GM083299],"We would like to thank D.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) that normally target messenger RNAs for degradation or translational arrest are the best-understood class of sRNAs. However, in Arabidopsis thaliana flowers, miRNAs account for only 5% of the sRNA mass and less than 0.1% of the sequence complexity. The remaining sRNAs form a complex population of more than 100,000 different small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) transcribed from thousands of loci(1-5). The biogenesis of most of the siRNAs in Arabidopsis are dependent on RNA polymerase IV (PolIV), a homologue of DNA-dependent RNA polymerase II(2,3,6). A subset of these PolIV-dependent (p4)-siRNAs are involved in stress responses, and others are associated with epigenetic modifications to DNA or chromatin; however, the biological role is not known for most of them. Here we show that the predominant phase of p4-siRNA accumulation is initiated in the maternal gametophyte and continues during seed development. Expression of p4-siRNAs in developing endosperm is specifically from maternal chromosomes.

In particular, histone H3 trimethylation at lysine 36 (H3K36me3) is associated with actively transcribed regions and has been proposed to provide landmarks for continuing transcription(3,4); however, the control mechanisms and functions of H3K36me3 in higher eukaryotes are unknown. Here we show that the H3K36me3-specific histone methyltransferase (HMTase) Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome candidate 1 (WHSC1, also known as NSD2 or MMSET) functions in transcriptional regulation together with developmental transcription factors whose defects overlap with the human disease Wolf Hirschhorn syndrome (WHS)(5,6). We found that mouse Whsc1, one of five putative Set2 homologues(2,7,8), governed H3K36me3 along euchromatin by associating with the cell-type-specific transcription factors Sall1, Sall4 and Nanog in embryonic stem cells, and Nkx2-5 in embryonic hearts, regulating the expression of their target genes. Whsc1-deficient mice showed growth retardation and various WHS-like midline defects, including congenital cardiovascular anomalies. The effects of Whsc1 haploin sufficiency were increased in Nkx2-5 heterozygous mutant hearts, indicating their functional link. We propose that WHSC1 functions together with developmental transcription factors to prevent the inappropriate transcription that can lead to various pathophysiologies.","[Nimura, Keisuke; Ura, Kiyoe; Kaneda, Yasufumi] Osaka Univ, Grad Sch Med, Div Gene Therapy Sci, Suita, Osaka 5650871, Japan; [Shiratori, Hidetaka] Osaka Univ, Grad Sch Frontier Biosci, Dev Genet Grp, Suita, Osaka 5650871, Japan; [Ikawa, Masato; Okabe, Masaru] Osaka Univ, Genome Informat Res Ctr, Suita, Osaka 5650871, Japan; [Schwartz, Robert J.] Ctr Mol Dev & Dis, Inst Biosci & Technol, Houston, TX 77030 USA","Ura, K (reprint author), Osaka Univ, Grad Sch Med, Div Gene Therapy Sci, 2-2 Yamada Oka, Suita, Osaka 5650871, Japan.",kiyoeura@gts.med.osaka-u.ac.jp; kaneday@gts.med.osaka-u.ac.jp,"ikawa, masahito/A-5315-2009; Okabe, Masaru/B-6917-2015","ikawa, masahito/0000-0001-9859-6217; Okabe, Masaru/0000-0002-0803-9044","Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology of Japan (MEXT); Naito Foundation; Osaka University","Acknowledgements We thank T.

These cell lines appear indistinguishable from human embryonic stem cells and iPS cells from healthy individuals. Most importantly, we show that corrected Fanconi-anaemia-specific iPS cells can give rise to haematopoietic progenitors of the myeloid and erythroid lineages that are phenotypically normal, that is, disease-free. These data offer proof-of-concept that iPS cell technology can be used for the generation of disease-corrected, patient-specific cells with potential value for cell therapy applications.","[Raya, Angel; Rodriguez-Piza, Ignasi; Navarro, Susana; Jose Barrero, Maria; Sleep, Eduard; Gonzalez, Federico; Tiscornia, Gustavo; Garreta, Elena; Aasen, Trond; Veiga, Anna; Izpisua Belmonte, Juan Carlos] Ctr Regenerat Med Barcelona, Barcelona 08003, Spain; [Raya, Angel] ICREA, Madrid 28040, Spain; [Raya, Angel; Sleep, Eduard; Garreta, Elena; Aasen, Trond] Networking Ctr Biomed Res Bioengn Biomat & Nanome, Madrid 28040, Spain; [Guenechea, Guillermo; Navarro, Susana; Rio, Paula; Bueren, Juan] CIEMAT, Hematopoiesis & Gene Therapy Div, E-28040 Madrid, Spain; [Guenechea, Guillermo; Navarro, Susana; Castella, Maria; Rio, Paula; Surralles, Jordi; Bueren, Juan] Networking Ctr Biomed Res Rare Dis CIBERER, I-25123 Brescia, Italy; [Consiglio, Antonella] Univ Brescia, Dept Biomed Sci & Biotechnol, I-25123 Brescia, Italy; [Castella, Maria; Surralles, Jordi] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Dept Genet & Microbiol, Bellaterra 08193, Spain; [Verma, Inder M.] Salk Inst Biol Studies, Genet Lab, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; [Izpisua Belmonte, Juan Carlos] Salk Inst Biol Studies, Gene Express Lab, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA","Belmonte, JCI (reprint author), Ctr Regenerat Med Barcelona, Dr Aiguader 88, Barcelona 08003, Spain.",belmonte@salk.edu,"Raya, Angel/E-6205-2010; Tiscornia, Gustavo/F-4423-2012; Guenechea, Guillermo/L-6119-2014; Navarro, Susana/L-9300-2014; Aasen, Trond/B-5279-2013; Bueren, Juan/L-6112-2014; Castella, Maria/J-8304-2015; Rio, Paula/G-8681-2015; Barrero, Maria/Q-1785-2017","Raya, Angel/0000-0003-2189-9775; Garreta Bahima, Elena/0000-0002-1071-9794; Guenechea, Guillermo/0000-0001-7679-0895; Navarro, Susana/0000-0002-0764-5384; Aasen, Trond/0000-0003-0763-2695; Bueren, Juan/0000-0002-3228-7013; Rio, Paula/0000-0002-5424-5543; Barrero, Maria/0000-0002-5990-7040; Tiscornia, Gustavo/0000-0002-1841-5330; Gonzalez Grassi, Federico/0000-0002-7147-2246; Vassena, Rita/0000-0002-0846-0365; Surralles, Jordi/0000-0002-4041-7519","MEC; DIUE; Ramon y Cajal program; ICREA-Academia program; Ministerio de Educacion y Ciencia [BFU2006-12251, SAF2005-00058, SAF2006-3440]; Genoma Espana (FANCOGENE); European Commission 'Marie-Curie Reintegration Grant' [MIRG-CT-2007-046523]; European Program CONSERT [LSHB-CT-2004-5242]; Fondo de Investigaciones Sanitarias [RETIC-RD06/0010/0016, PI061897, PI061099]; Marato de TV3 [063430]; G.

Previous experiments have led to wide acceptance that limb tissues dedifferentiate to form pluripotent cells. Here we have reexamined this question using an integrated GFP transgene to track the major limb tissues during limb regeneration in the salamander Ambystoma mexicanum (the axolotl). Surprisingly, we find that each tissue produces progenitor cells with restricted potential. Therefore, the blastema is a heterogeneous collection of restricted progenitor cells. On the basis of these findings, we further demonstrate that positional identity is a cell-type-specific property of blastema cells, in which cartilage-derived blastema cells harbour positional identity but Schwann-derived cells do not. Our results show that the complex phenomenon of limb regeneration can be achieved without complete dedifferentiation to a pluripotent state, a conclusion with important implications for regenerative medicine.","[Kragl, Martin; Knapp, Dunja; Nacu, Eugen; Khattak, Shahryar; Tanaka, Elly M.] Max Planck Inst Mol Cell Biol & Genet, D-01307 Dresden, Germany; [Epperlein, Hans Henning] Tech Univ Dresden, Fac Med, Inst Anat, D-01307 Dresden, Germany; [Kragl, Martin; Knapp, Dunja; Nacu, Eugen; Khattak, Shahryar; Tanaka, Elly M.] Tech Univ Dresden, Ctr Regenerat Therapies, D-01307 Dresden, Germany; [Maden, Malcolm] Univ Florida, McKnight Brian Inst, Regenerat Project, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA","Tanaka, EM (reprint author), Max Planck Inst Mol Cell Biol & Genet, Pfotenhauerstr 108, D-01307 Dresden, Germany.",elly.tanaka@crt-dresden.de,"Tanaka, Elly/F-8572-2010; Knapp, Dunja/N-2180-2017","Knapp, Dunja/0000-0002-7533-2208; Tanaka, Elly/0000-0003-4240-2158","Volkswagen Foundation [I/78 766]; DFG [SFB655, SPP1109, SPP 1356]; BMBF Biofutures program; Max Planck Institute; Center of Regenerative Therapies; Alexander von Humboldt Foundation","This work was supported by grants from the Volkswagen Foundation I/78 766; DFG SFB655, SPP1109, SPP 1356, the BMBF Biofutures program, funds from the Max Planck Institute, and the Center of Regenerative Therapies, Dresden.

Either stimulation of Wnt/beta-catenin signalling or overexpression of telomerase is sufficient to activate quiescent epidermal stem cells in vivo, although the mechanisms by which telomerase exerts these effects are not understood. Here we show that telomerase directly modulates Wnt/beta-catenin signalling by serving as a cofactor in a beta-catenin transcriptional complex. The telomerase protein component TERT (telomerase reverse transcriptase) interacts with BRG1 (also called SMARCA4), a SWI/SNF-related chromatin remodelling protein, and activates Wnt-dependent reporters in cultured cells and in vivo. TERT serves an essential role in formation of the anterior-posterior axis in Xenopus laevis embryos, and this defect in Wnt signalling manifests as homeotic transformations in the vertebrae of Tert(-/-) mice. Chromatin immunoprecipitation of the endogenous TERT protein from mouse gastrointestinal tract shows that TERT physically occupies gene promoters of Wnt-dependent genes. These data reveal an unanticipated role for telomerase as a transcriptional modulator of the Wnt/beta-catenin signalling pathway.","[Park, Jae-Il; Venteicher, Andrew S.; Choi, Jinkuk; Jun, Sohee; Shkreli, Marina; Chang, Woody; Cheung, Peggie; Artandi, Steven E.] Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Dept Med, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Venteicher, Andrew S.; Artandi, Steven E.] Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Biophys Program, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Choi, Jinkuk; Artandi, Steven E.] Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Canc Biol Program, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Hong, Ji Yeon; Ji, Hong; McCrea, Pierre D.] Univ Texas MD Anderson Canc Ctr, Dept Biochem & Mol Biol, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Meng, Zhaojing; Veenstra, Timothy D.] NCI, Lab Prote & Analyt Technol, Adv Technol Program, SAIC Frederick Inc, Frederick, MD 21702 USA; [McLaughlin, Margaret] MIT, Koch Inst Integrat Canc Biol, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [McLaughlin, Margaret] MIT, Dept Biol, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Nusse, Roel] Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Dept Dev Biol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA","Artandi, SE (reprint author), Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Dept Med, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",sartandi@stanford.edu,,"PARK, JAE-IL/0000-0002-0737-2654","Stanford Comprehensive Cancer Center Fellowship; NCI [CA111691, CA125453]; California Breast Cancer Research Program","We thank P.

In the continuing development of increasingly powerful computers as well as alternative technologies based on the prospects of quantum information processing, switching and amplification functionalities are being sought in ultrasmall objects, such as nanotubes, molecules or atoms(1-9). Among the possible choices of signal carriers, photons are particularly attractive because of their robustness against decoherence, but their control at the nano-metre scale poses a significant challenge as conventional nonlinear materials become ineffective. To remedy this shortcoming, resonances in optical emitters can be exploited, and atomic ensembles have been successfully used to mediate weak light beams(7). However, single-emitter manipulation of photonic signals has remained elusive and has only been studied in high-finesse microcavities(10-13) or waveguides(8,14). Here we demonstrate that a single dye molecule can operate as an optical transistor and coherently attenuate or amplify a tightly focused laser beam, depending on the power of a second 'gating' beam that controls the degree of population inversion. Such a quantum optical transistor has also the potential for manipulating non-classical light fields down to the single-photon level.

Memories based on tunnel junctions with ultrathin ferroelectric barriers would enable non-destructive resistive readout(3). However, the achievement of room-temperature polarization stability and switching at very low thickness is challenging(4,5). Here we use piezoresponse force microscopy at room temperature to show robust ferroelectricity down to 1 nm in highly strained BaTiO(3) films; we also use room-temperature conductive-tip atomic force microscopy to demonstrate resistive readout of the polarization state through its influence on the tunnel current(6,7). The resulting electroresistance effect scales exponentially with ferroelectric film thickness, reaching similar to 75,000% at 3 nm. Our approach exploits the otherwise undesirable leakage current-dominated by tunnelling at these very low thicknesses-to read the polarization state without destroying it. We demonstrate scalability down to 70 nm, corresponding to potential densities of >16 Gbit inch(-2). These results pave the way towards ferroelectric memories with simplified architectures, higher densities and faster operation, and should inspire further exploration of the interplay between quantum tunnelling and ferroelectricity at the nanoscale.","[Garcia, V.; Fusil, S.; Bouzehouane, K.; Barthelemy, A.; Bibes, M.] Unite Mixte Phys CNRS Thales, F-91767 Palaiseau, France; [Garcia, V.; Fusil, S.; Bouzehouane, K.; Barthelemy, A.; Bibes, M.] Univ Paris 11, F-91405 Orsay, France; [Garcia, V.; Mathur, N.

Proxy records indicate, however, that the Earth's atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations did not fall below about 200-250 parts per million during this period(8). The stabilization of atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations near this minimum value suggests that strong negative feedback mechanisms inhibited further drawdown of atmospheric carbon dioxide by high rates of global silicate rock weathering. Here we investigate one possible negative feedback mechanism, occurring under relatively low carbon dioxide concentrations and in warm climates, that is related to terrestrial plant productivity and its role in the decomposition of silicate minerals(9-11). We use simulations of terrestrial and geochemical carbon cycles and available experimental evidence to show that vegetation activity in upland regions of active orogens was severely limited by near-starvation of carbon dioxide in combination with global warmth over this period. These conditions diminished biotic-driven silicate rock weathering and thereby attenuated an important long-term carbon dioxide sink. Although our modelling results are semi-quantitative and do not capture the full range of biogeochemical feedbacks that could influence the climate, our analysis indicates that the dynamic equilibrium between plants, climate and the geosphere probably buffered the minimum atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations over the past 24 million years.","[Pagani, Mark; Berner, Robert] Yale Univ, Dept Geol & Geophys, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Caldeira, Ken] Carnegie Inst Washington, Dept Global Ecol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Beerling, David J.] Univ Sheffield, Dept Anim & Plant Sci, Sheffield S10 2TN, S Yorkshire, England","Pagani, M (reprint author), Yale Univ, Dept Geol & Geophys, POB 6666, New Haven, CT 06520 USA.",mark.pagani@yale.edu,"Beerling, David/C-2840-2009; Caldeira, Ken/E-7914-2011; Pagani, Mark/B-3233-2008","Beerling, David/0000-0003-1869-4314; ",NSF [OCE-0095734]; DOE [DE-FG02-01ER15173]; Leverhulme Trust; Natural Environment Research Council [NE/E015190/1]; Royal Society-Wolfson Research Merit Award; Yale Climate and Energy Institute,"Conversations with C.

The upper and middle crust are constructed by dyking and sea-floor eruptions originating from magma accumulated in mid-crustal lenses at the spreading axis(2-6), but the style of accretion of the lower oceanic crust is actively debated(7). Models based on geological and petrological data from ophiolites propose that the lower oceanic crust is accreted from melt sills intruded at multiple levels between the Moho transition zone (MTZ) and the mid-crustal lens(8-11), consistent with geophysical studies that suggest the presence of melt within the lower crust(12-16). However, seismic images of molten sills within the lower crust have been elusive. Until now, only seismic reflections from mid-crustal melt lenses(2,17,18) and sills within the MTZ have been described(19), suggesting that melt is efficiently transported through the lower crust. Here we report deep crustal seismic reflections off the southern Juan de Fuca ridge that we interpret as originating from a molten sill at present accreting the lower oceanic crust. The sill sits 5-6 km beneath the sea floor and 850-900 m above the MTZ, and is located 1.4-3.2 km off the spreading axis. Our results provide evidence for the existence of low-permeability barriers to melt migration within the lower section of modern oceanic crust forming at intermediate-to-fast spreading rates, as inferred from ophiolite studies(9,10).","[Canales, J.

For example, subjects are able to rapidly detect the presence of object categories such as animals or vehicles in new scenes that are presented very briefly(1,2). This is even true when subjects do not pay attention to the scenes and simultaneously perform an unrelated attentionally demanding task(3), a stark contrast to the capacity limitations predicted by most theories of visual attention(4,5). Here we show a neural basis for rapid natural scene categorization in the visual cortex, using functional magnetic resonance imaging and an object categorization task in which subjects detected the presence of people or cars in briefly presented natural scenes. The multi-voxel pattern of neural activity in the object-selective cortex evoked by the natural scenes contained information about the presence of the target category, even when the scenes were task-irrelevant and presented outside the focus of spatial attention. These findings indicate that the rapid detection of categorical information in natural scenes is mediated by a category-specific biasing mechanism in object-selective cortex that operates in parallel across the visual field, and biases information processing in favour of objects belonging to the target object category.","[Peelen, Marius V.; Fei-Fei, Li; Kastner, Sabine] Princeton Univ, Dept Psychol, Princeton, NJ 08540 USA; [Peelen, Marius V.; Kastner, Sabine] Princeton Univ, Ctr Study Brain Mind & Behav, Princeton, NJ 08540 USA; [Peelen, Marius V.; Kastner, Sabine] Princeton Univ, Princeton Neurosci Inst, Princeton, NJ 08540 USA; [Fei-Fei, Li] Princeton Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Princeton, NJ 08540 USA","Peelen, MV (reprint author), Princeton Univ, Dept Psychol, Princeton, NJ 08540 USA.",mpeelen@princeton.edu,"Peelen, Marius/D-1780-2010","Peelen, Marius/0000-0002-4026-7303","National Institutes of Health [2RO1 MH64043, 1RO1 EY017699, 2P50 MH-62196]; Microsoft Research New Faculty Fellowship","We thank P.

The causative agent, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, proliferates within host macrophages where it modifies both its intracellular and local tissue environment, resulting in caseous granulomas with incomplete bacterial sterilization(3,4). Although infection by various mycobacterial species produces a cyclic AMP burst within macrophages that influences cell signalling, the underlying mechanism for the cAMP burst remains unclear(5-7). Here we show that among the 17 adenylate cyclase genes present in M. tuberculosis, at least one (Rv0386) is required for virulence. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the Rv0386 adenylate cyclase facilitates delivery of bacterial-derived cAMP into the macrophage cytoplasm. Loss of Rv0386 and the intramacrophage cAMP it delivers results in reductions in TNF-alpha production via the protein kinase A and cAMP response-element-binding protein pathway, decreased immunopathology in animal tissues, and diminished bacterial survival. Direct intoxication of host cells by bacterial-derived cAMP may enable M. tuberculosis to modify both its intracellular and tissue environments to facilitate its long-term survival.","[Agarwal, Nisheeth; Lamichhane, Gyanu; Gupta, Radhika; Nolan, Scott; Bishai, William R.] Johns Hopkins Sch Med, Dept Med, Baltimore, MD 21231 USA","Bishai, WR (reprint author), Johns Hopkins Sch Med, Dept Med, CRB2,Room 1-08,1550 Orleans St, Baltimore, MD 21231 USA.",wbishai@jhmi.edu,,"Lamichhane, Gyanu/0000-0002-2214-0114","National Institutes of Health (NIH) [AI30036, AI36973, AI37856]","The support of National Institutes of Health (NIH) awards AI30036, AI36973 and AI37856 is gratefully acknowledged.",,34,117,118,1,26,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,2-Jul,2009,460,7251,,,,,98,U112,,10.1038/nature08123,,7,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,464XW,WOS:000267545200037,19516256,No,,,11/20/17

Although this predictable pattern of CD8 T-cell responses is well established, the underlying cellular mechanisms regulating the transition to T(M) cells remain undefined(1,2). Here we show that tumour necrosis factor (TNF) receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6), an adaptor protein in the TNF-receptor and interleukin-1R/Toll-like receptor superfamily, regulates CD8 T(M)-cell development after infection by modulating fatty acid metabolism. We show that mice with a T-cell-specific deletion of TRAF6 mount robust CD8 T(E)-cell responses, but have a profound defect in their ability to generate T(M) cells that is characterized by the disappearance of antigen-specific cells in the weeks after primary immunization. Microarray analyses revealed that TRAF6-deficient CD8 T cells exhibit altered expression of genes that regulate fatty acid metabolism. Consistent with this, activated CD8 T cells lacking TRAF6 display defective AMP-activated kinase activation and mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation (FAO) in response to growth factor withdrawal. Administration of the anti-diabetic drug metformin restored FAO and CD8 T(M)-cell generation in the absence of TRAF6. This treatment also increased CD8 T(M) cells in wild-type mice, and consequently was able to considerably improve the efficacy of an experimental anti-cancer vaccine.","[Pearce, Erika L.; Walsh, Matthew C.; Cejas, Pedro J.; Harms, Gretchen M.; Wang, Li-San; Choi, Yongwon] Univ Penn, Sch Med, Dept Pathol & Lab Med, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Shen, Hao] Univ Penn, Sch Med, Dept Microbiol, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Wang, Li-San] Univ Penn, Sch Med, Penn Ctr Bioinformat, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Jones, Russell G.] McGill Univ, Dept Physiol, McGill Canc Ctr, Montreal, PQ H3G 1Y6, Canada","Choi, YW (reprint author), Univ Penn, Sch Med, Dept Pathol & Lab Med, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",ychoi3@mail.med.upenn.edu,,,NIH; CIHR; NCI Institutional Training Grant,"We thank C.

Considerable effort has gone into designing vaccine regimens that will increase the magnitude of the memory response, but there has been minimal emphasis on developing strategies to improve the functional qualities of memory T cells(4). Here we show that mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin(5), also known as FRAP1) is a major regulator of memory CD8 T-cell differentiation, and in contrast to what we expected, the immunosuppressive drug rapamycin has immunostimulatory effects on the generation of memory CD8 T cells. Treatment of mice with rapamycin following acute lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus infection enhanced not only the quantity but also the quality of virus-specific CD8 T cells. Similar effects were seen after immunization of mice with a vaccine based on non-replicating virus-like particles. In addition, rapamycin treatment also enhanced memory T-cell responses in non-human primates following vaccination with modified vaccinia virus Ankara. Rapamycin was effective during both the expansion and contraction phases of the T-cell response; during the expansion phase it increased the number of memory precursors, and during the contraction phase (effector to memory transition) it accelerated the memory T-cell differentiation program. Experiments using RNA interference to inhibit expression of mTOR, raptor (also known as 4932417H02Rik) or FKBP12 (also known as FKBP1A) in antigen-specific CD8 T cells showed that mTOR acts intrinsically through the mTORC1 (mTOR complex 1) pathway to regulate memory T-cell differentiation. Thus these studies identify a molecular pathway regulating memory formation and provide an effective strategy for improving the functional qualities of vaccine-or infection-induced memory T cells.","[Araki, Koichi; Ahmed, Rafi] Emory Univ, Sch Med, Emory Vaccine Ctr, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA; [Araki, Koichi; Ahmed, Rafi] Emory Univ, Sch Med, Dept Microbiol & Immunol, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA; [Turner, Alexandra P.; Shaffer, Virginia Oliva; Gangappa, Shivaprakash; Larsen, Christian P.] Emory Univ, Sch Med, Emory Transplant Ctr, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA; [Turner, Alexandra P.; Shaffer, Virginia Oliva; Gangappa, Shivaprakash; Larsen, Christian P.] Emory Univ, Sch Med, Dept Surg, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA; [Keller, Susanne A.; Bachmann, Martin F.] Cytos Biotechnol AG, CH-8952 Zurich, Switzerland","Ahmed, R (reprint author), Emory Univ, Sch Med, Emory Vaccine Ctr, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA.",rahmed@emory.edu,"Larsen, Christian/B-6906-2012; Shaffer, Virginia/G-7945-2012","Larsen, Christian/0000-0001-6573-2649; ","NIH [AI030048, N01-AI-50025, AI040519]",We thank B.

Unravelling the mechanisms for the diversification of human heart cell lineages has been hampered by the lack of genetic tools to purify early cardiac progenitors and define their developmental potential(1-4). Recent studies in the mouse embryo have identified a multipotent cardiac progenitor that contributes to all of the major cell types in the murine heart(5-8). In contrast to murine development, human cardiogenesis has a much longer onset of heart cell lineage diversification and expansion, suggesting divergent pathways. Here we identify a diverse set of human fetal ISL1(+) cardiovascular progenitors that give rise to the cardiomyocyte, smooth muscle and endothelial cell lineages. Using two independent transgenic and gene-targeting approaches in human embryonic stem cell lines, we show that purified ISL1(+) primordial progenitors are capable of self-renewal and expansion before differentiation into the three major cell types in the heart.

Although the Jak-Stat3 pathway is essential and sufficient to mediate LIF signals(1,2), it is still unclear how these signals are linked to the core circuitry of pluripotency-associated transcription factors, consisting of Oct3/4 (also called Pou5f1), Sox2 and Nanog(3,4). Here we show that two LIF signalling pathways are each connected to the core circuitry via different transcription factors. In mouse ES cells, Klf4 is mainly activated by the Jak-Stat3 pathway and preferentially activates Sox2, whereas Tbx3 is preferentially regulated by the phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase-Akt and mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways and predominantly stimulates Nanog. In the absence of LIF, artificial expression of Klf4 or Tbx3 is sufficient to maintain pluripotency while maintaining the expression of Oct3/4. Notably, overexpression of Nanog supports LIF-independent self-renewal of mouse ES cells in the absence of Klf4 and Tbx3 activity. Therefore, Klf4 and Tbx3 are involved in mediating LIF signalling to the core circuitry but are not directly associated with the maintenance of pluripotency, because ES cells keep pluripotency without their expression in the particular context.","[Niwa, Hitoshi; Ogawa, Kazuya; Shimosato, Daisuke; Adachi, Kenjiro] RIKEN Ctr Dev Biol, Lab Pluripotent Cell Studies, Chuo Ku, Kobe, Hyogo 6500047, Japan; [Niwa, Hitoshi; Shimosato, Daisuke] Kobe Univ, Grad Sch Med, Lab Dev & Regenerat Med, Chuo Ku, Kobe, Hyogo 6500017, Japan; [Niwa, Hitoshi] JST, CREST, Chiyoda Ku, Tokyo 1020075, Japan","Niwa, H (reprint author), RIKEN Ctr Dev Biol, Lab Pluripotent Cell Studies, Chuo Ku, 2-2-3 Minatojima Minamimachi, Kobe, Hyogo 6500047, Japan.",niwa@cdb.riken.jp,,,,,,30,463,475,1,51,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,2-Jul,2009,460,7251,,,,,118,122,,10.1038/nature08113,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,464XW,WOS:000267545200041,19571885,No,Y,N,11/20/17

Central to the core machinery of apoptosis are the caspases and their proximal regulators. Current models for caspase control involve a balance of opposing elements, with variable contributions from positive and negative regulators among different cell types and species(1). To advance a comprehensive view of components that support caspase-dependent cell death, we conducted a genome-wide silencing screen in the Drosophila model. Our strategy used a library of double-stranded RNAs together with a chemical antagonist of Inhibitor of apoptosis proteins (IAPs) that simulates the action of native regulators in the Reaper and Smac (also known as Diablo) families(2). Here we present a highly validated set of targets that is necessary for death provoked by several stimuli. Among these, Tango7 is identified as a new effector. Cells depleted for this gene resisted apoptosis at a step before the induction of effector caspase activity, and the directed silencing of Tango7 in Drosophila prevented caspase-dependent programmed cell death. Unlike known apoptosis regulators in this model system(3), Tango7 activity did not influence stimulus-dependent loss of Drosophila DIAP1 (also known as th and IAP1), but instead regulated levels of the apical caspase Dronc (Nc). Similarly, the human Tango7 counterpart, PCID1 (also known as EIF3M), impinged on caspase 9, revealing a new regulatory axis affecting the apoptosome.","[Chew, Su Kit; Chen, Po; Link, Nichole; Galindo, Kathleen A.; Pogue, Kristi; Abrams, John M.] Univ Texas SW Med Ctr Dallas, Dept Cell Biol, Dallas, TX 75390 USA","Abrams, JM (reprint author), Univ Texas SW Med Ctr Dallas, Dept Cell Biol, Dallas, TX 75390 USA.",john.abrams@utsouthwestern.edu,,,National Institute of General Medical Sciences; National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism; UTSW High Impact/High Risk Grant Program; National Research Service Award,"We thank X.

During differentiation, mouse ES cells undergo global epigenetic reprogramming, as exemplified by X-chromosome inactivation (XCI) in which one female X chromosome is silenced to achieve gene dosage parity between the sexes(3-5). Somatic XCI is regulated by homologous X-chromosome pairing(6,7) and counting(8-10), and by the random choice of future active and inactive X chromosomes. XCI and cell differentiation are tightly coupled(11), as blocking one process compromises the other(8,12) and dedifferentiation of somatic cells to induced pluripotent stem cells is accompanied by X chromosome reactivation(2). Recent evidence suggests coupling of Xist expression to pluripotency factors occurs(13), but how the two are interconnected remains unknown. Here we show that Oct4 (also known as Pou5f1)(14) lies at the top of the XCI hierarchy, and regulates XCI by triggering X-chromosome pairing and counting. Oct4 directly binds Tsix and Xite, two regulatory noncoding RNA genes of the X-inactivation centre(15,16), and also complexes with XCI trans-factors, Ctcf and Yy1 (ref. 17), through protein-protein interactions. Depletion of Oct4 blocks homologous X-chromosome pairing and results in the inactivation of both X chromosomes in female cells. Thus, we have identified the first trans-factor that regulates counting, and ascribed new functions to Oct4 during X-chromosome reprogramming.","[Donohoe, Mary E.; Silva, Susana S.; Pinter, Stefan F.; Xu, Na; Lee, Jeannie T.] Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Boston, MA 02114 USA; [Donohoe, Mary E.; Silva, Susana S.; Pinter, Stefan F.; Xu, Na; Lee, Jeannie T.] Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Dept Mol Biol, Boston, MA 02114 USA; [Donohoe, Mary E.; Silva, Susana S.; Pinter, Stefan F.; Xu, Na; Lee, Jeannie T.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Genet, Boston, MA 02114 USA; [Lee, Jeannie T.] Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Dept Pathol, Boston, MA 02114 USA","Lee, JT (reprint author), Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Boston, MA 02114 USA.",lee@molbio.mgh.harvard.edu,,"Pinter, Stefan/0000-0003-4750-1403",National Institutes of Health [GM58839],"We thank N.

Decreased insulin-like signalling causes the somatic misexpression of the germline-limited pie-1 and pgl family of genes in intestinal and ectodermal tissues. The forkhead boxO1A (FOXO) transcription factor DAF-16, the major transcriptional effector of insulin-like signalling, regulates pie-1 expression by directly binding to the pie-1 promoter. The somatic tissues of insulin-like mutants are more germline-like and protected from genotoxic stress. Gene inactivation of components of the cytosolic chaperonin complex that induce increased longevity also causes somatic misexpression of PGL-1. These results indicate that the acquisition of germline characteristics by the somatic cells of C. elegans mutants with increased longevity contributes to their increased health and survival.","[Curran, Sean P.; Wu, Xiaoyun; Riedel, Christian G.; Ruvkun, Gary] Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Dept Mol Biol, Boston, MA 02114 USA; [Curran, Sean P.; Wu, Xiaoyun; Riedel, Christian G.; Ruvkun, Gary] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Genet, Boston, MA 02114 USA","Ruvkun, G (reprint author), Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Dept Mol Biol, Boston, MA 02114 USA.",ruvkun@molbio.mgh.harvard.edu,,"Riedel, Christian/0000-0002-3689-8022","National Institutes of Health; National Institute on Aging [F32-AG026207, R01-AG016636]; European Molecular Biology Organization; Human Frontier Science Program","Some strains were provided by the Caenorhabditis Genetics Center, which is funded by the National Institutes of Health National Center for Research Resources.

Here, using integrative analysis of a genomic profile of the region, we identify a Golgi protein, GOLPH3, as a candidate targeted for amplification. Gain- and loss-of-function studies in vitro and in vivo validated GOLPH3 as a potent oncogene. Physically, GOLPH3 localizes to the trans- Golgi network and interacts with components of the retromer complex, which in yeast has been linked to target of rapamycin ( TOR) signalling. Mechanistically, GOLPH3 regulates cell size, enhances growth-factor-induced mTOR (also known as FRAP1) signalling in human cancer cells, and alters the response to an mTOR inhibitor in vivo. Thus, genomic and genetic, biological, functional and biochemical data in yeast and humans establishes GOLPH3 as a new oncogene that is commonly targeted for amplification in human cancer, and is capable of modulating the response to rapamycin, a cancer drug in clinical use.","[Scott, Kenneth L.; Kabbarah, Omar; Liang, Mei-Chih; Wu, Joyce; Dhakal, Sabin; Wu, Min; Chen, Shujuan; Feinberg, Tamar; Huang, Joseph; Wong, Kwok-Kin; Chin, Lynda] Harvard Univ, Ctr Canc, Dept Med Oncol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Ivanova, Elena; Xiao, Yonghong; Protopopov, Alexei; Chin, Lynda] Harvard Univ, Ctr Canc, Belfer Inst Appl Canc Sci, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Widlund, Hans R.; Fisher, David E.] Harvard Univ, Ctr Canc, Dana Farber Canc Inst, Dept Pediat Oncol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Wong, Kwok-Kin] Harvard Univ, Ctr Canc, Ludwig Ctr Dana Farber, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Anagnostou, Valsamo; Rimm, David L.] Yale Univ, Sch Med, Dept Pathol, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Saci, Abdel] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Syst Biol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Widlund, Hans R.; Chin, Lynda] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Brigham & Womens Hosp, Dept Dermatol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Fisher, David E.] Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Dept Dermatol, Boston, MA 02114 USA","Chin, L (reprint author), Harvard Univ, Ctr Canc, Dept Med Oncol, Boston, MA 02115 USA.",lynda_chin@dfci.harvard.edu,,"wong, kwok kin/0000-0001-6323-235X","American Cancer Society [PF-07-039-01-CSM]; National Institutes of Health (NIH) [5-T32-AR07098-31, R01 AG2400401, R01 CA122794, RO-1 CA 114277, RO1 CA93947, P50 CA93683]; Program of Research Excellence (SPORE) grant [P50 CA090578]","We thank R.

Although pairing of cognate SNAREs is sufficient to fuse membranes in vitro, a complete reconstitution of the Rab-SNARE machinery has never been achieved. Here we report the reconstitution of the early endosomal canine Rab5 GTPase, its key regulators and effectors together with SNAREs into proteoliposomes using a set of 17 recombinant human proteins. These vesicles behave like minimal 'synthetic' endosomes, fusing with purified early endosomes or with each other in vitro. Membrane fusion measured by content-mixing and morphological assays requires the cooperativity between Rab5 effectors and cognate SNAREs which, together, form a more efficient 'core machinery' than SNAREs alone. In reconstituting a fusion mechanism dependent on both a Rab GTPase and SNAREs, our work shows that the two machineries act coordinately to increase the specificity and efficiency of the membrane tethering and fusion process.","[Ohya, Takeshi; Miaczynska, Marta; Coskun, Unal; Lommer, Barbara; Runge, Anja; Drechsel, David; Kalaidzidis, Yannis; Zerial, Marino] Max Planck Inst Mol Cell Biol & Genet, D-01309 Dresden, Germany; [Kalaidzidis, Yannis] Moscow MV Lomonosov State Univ, AN Belozersky Inst Physicochem Biol, Moscow 119899, Russia","Zerial, M (reprint author), Max Planck Inst Mol Cell Biol & Genet, Pfotenhauerstr 108, D-01309 Dresden, Germany.",zerial@mpi-cbg.de,"Coskun, Unal/F-4683-2011; Kalaidzidis, Yannis/H-3094-2016","Coskun, Unal/0000-0003-4375-3144; Kalaidzidis, Yannis/0000-0002-6137-1193; Miaczynska, Marta/0000-0003-0031-5267",German Ministry for Education and Research [0313082J]; EU Integrated Project EndoTrack; DFG; Max Planck Society; The Nakatomi Foundation,"We are grateful to K.

These plume particles are the dominant source of Saturn's E ring(7,8). A previous in situ analysis(9) of these particles concluded that the minor organic or siliceous components, identified in many ice grains, could be evidence for interaction between Enceladus' rocky core and liquid water(9,10). It was not clear, however, whether the liquid is still present today or whether it has frozen. Here we report the identification of a population of E-ring grains that are rich in sodium salts (similar to 0.5-2% by mass), which can arise only if the plumes originate from liquid water. The abundance of various salt components in these particles, as well as the inferred basic pH, exhibit a compelling similarity to the predicted composition of a subsurface Enceladus ocean in contact with its rock core(11). The plume vapour is expected to be free of atomic sodium. Thus, the absence of sodium from optical spectra(12) is in good agreement with our results.

Alternatively, the source might be ice warmed, melted or crushed by tectonic motions(4). Sodium chloride (that is, salt) is expected to be present in a long-lived ocean in contact with a rocky core. Here we report a ground-based spectroscopic search for atomic sodium near Enceladus that places an upper limit on the mixing ratio in the vapour plumes orders of magnitude below the expected ocean salinity(5). The low sodium content of escaping vapour, together with the small fraction of salt-bearing particles(6), argues against a situation in which a near-surface geyser is fuelled by a salty ocean through cracks in the crust(1). The lack of observable sodium in the vapour is consistent with a wide variety of alternative eruption sources, including a deep ocean(6), a freshwater reservoir, or ice.

In group III-V materials, the resonance and coherence between two ground states of the single spin are inevitably affected by the lattice nuclear spins through the hyperfine interaction(7-9), while the dynamics of the single spin also influence the nuclear environment(10-15). Recent efforts(12,16) have been made to protect the coherence of spins in quantum dots by suppressing the nuclear spin fluctuations. However, coherent control of a single spin in a single dot with simultaneous suppression of the nuclear fluctuations has yet to be achieved. Here we report the suppression of nuclear field fluctuations in a singly charged quantum dot to well below the thermal value, as shown by an enhancement of the single electron spin dephasing time T-2*, which we measure using coherent dark-state spectroscopy. The suppression of nuclear fluctuations is found to result from a hole-spin assisted dynamic nuclear spin polarization feedback process, where the stable value of the nuclear field is determined only by the laser frequencies at fixed laser powers. This nuclear field locking is further demonstrated in a three-laser measurement, indicating a possible enhancement of the electron spin T-2* by a factor of several hundred. This is a simple and powerful method of enhancing the electron spin coherence time without use of 'spin echo'-type techniques(8,12). We expect that our results will enable the reproducible preparation of the nuclear spin environment for repetitive control and measurement of a single spin with minimal statistical broadening.","[Xu, Xiaodong; Sun, Bo; Steel, Duncan G.] Univ Michigan, Harrison M Randall Lab Phys, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Bracker, Allan S.; Gammon, Daniel] USN, Res Lab, Washington, DC 20375 USA; [Sham, L.

Very similar patterns are observed when initially uniform streams of dry granular material break up into clusters of grains(4-6), even though flows of macroscopic particles are considered to lack surface tension(7,8). Recent studies on freely falling granular streams tracked fluctuations in the stream profile(9), but the clustering mechanism remained unresolved because the full evolution of the instability could not be observed. Here we demonstrate that the cluster formation is driven by minute, nanoNewton cohesive forces that arise from a combination of van der Waals interactions and capillary bridges between nanometre-scale surface asperities. Our experiments involve high-speed video imaging of the granular stream in the co-moving frame, control over the properties of the grain surfaces and the use of atomic force microscopy to measure grain-grain interactions. The cohesive forces that we measure correspond to an equivalent surface tension five orders of magnitude below that of ordinary liquids.

Primary productivity over large areas of the EEP is limited by silicic acid and iron availability, and because of this constraint the organic carbon export to the deep ocean is unable to compensate for the outgassing of carbon dioxide that occurs through upwelling of deep waters. It has been suggested that the delivery of dust-borne iron to the glacial ocean(2,3) could have increased primary productivity and enhanced deep-sea carbon export in this region, lowering atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations during glacial periods. Such a role for the EEP is supported by higher organic carbon burial rates documented in underlying glacial sediments(4,5), but lower opal accumulation rates cast doubts on the importance of the EEP as an oceanic region for significant glacial carbon dioxide drawdown(6,7). Here we present a new silicon isotope record that suggests the paradoxical decline in opal accumulation rate in the glacial EEP results from a decrease in the silicon to carbon uptake ratio of diatoms under conditions of increased iron availability from enhanced dust input. Consequently, our study supports the idea of an invigorated biological pump in this region during the last glacial period that could have contributed to glacial carbon dioxide drawdown. Additionally, using evidence from silicon and nitrogen isotope changes, we infer that, in contrast to the modern situation, the biological productivity in this region is not constrained by the availability of iron, silicon and nitrogen during the glacial period. We hypothesize that an invigorated biological carbon dioxide pump constrained perhaps only by phosphorus limitation was a more common occurrence in low-latitude areas of the glacial ocean.","[Pichevin, L.

Measurable variations in the Nd-142/Nd-144 values of rocks resulting from Sm-Nd fractionation could therefore only have been produced within about 400 million years of the Solar System's formation ( that is, when Sm-146 was extant). The Nd-142/(144) Nd compositions of terrestrial rocks(1-7) are accordingly a sensitive monitor of the main silicate differentiation events that took place in the early Earth. High Nd-142/(144) Nd values measured in some Archaean rocks from Greenland(1-5) hint at the existence of an early incompatible-element-depleted mantle. Here we present measurements of low Nd-142/(144) Nd values in 1.48-gigayear-(Gyr)old lithospheric mantle-derived alkaline rocks from the Khariar nepheline syenite complex in southeastern India(8). These data suggest that a reservoir that was relatively enriched in incompatible elements formed at least 4.2 Gyr ago and traces of its isotopic signature persisted within the lithospheric root of the Bastar craton until at least 1.48 Gyr ago. These low Nd-142/(144) Nd compositions may represent a diluted signature of a Hadean (4 to 4.57 Gyr ago) enriched reservoir that is characterized by even lower values. That no evidence of the early depleted mantle has been observed in rocks younger than 3.6 Gyr (refs 3, 4, 7) implies that such domains had effectively mixed back into the convecting mantle by then. In contrast, some early enriched components apparently escaped this fate. Thus, the mantle sampled by magmatism since 3.6 Gyr ago may be biased towards a depleted composition that would be balanced by relatively more enriched reservoirs that are 'hidden' in Hadean crust(6), the D '' layer(9-11) of the lowermost mantle or, as we propose here, also within the roots of old cratons.","[Upadhyay, Dewashish; Scherer, Erik E.; Mezger, Klaus] Univ Munster, Inst Mineral, Zent Lab Geochronol, D-48149 Munster, Germany","Upadhyay, D (reprint author), Univ Munster, Inst Mineral, Zent Lab Geochronol, Corrensstr 24, D-48149 Munster, Germany.",upadhyay@uni-muenster.de,"Mezger, Klaus/D-9502-2011; Scherer, Erik/P-3388-2017","Mezger, Klaus/0000-0002-2443-8539; Scherer, Erik/0000-0001-6049-6202",Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft [ME1717],D.

During the first few weeks of surveillance, the virus spread worldwide to 30 countries (as of May 11) by human-to-human transmission, causing the World Health Organization to raise its pandemic alert to level 5 of 6. This virus has the potential to develop into the first influenza pandemic of the twenty-first century. Here we use evolutionary analysis to estimate the time-scale of the origins and the early development of the S-OIV epidemic. We show that it was derived from several viruses circulating in swine, and that the initial transmission to humans occurred several months before recognition of the outbreak. A phylogenetic estimate of the gaps in genetic surveillance indicates a long period of unsampled ancestry before the S-OIV outbreak, suggesting that the reassortment of swine lineages may have occurred years before emergence in humans, and that the multiple genetic ancestry of S-OIV is not indicative of an artificial origin. Furthermore, the unsampled history of the epidemic means that the nature and location of the genetically closest swine viruses reveal little about the immediate origin of the epidemic, despite the fact that we included a panel of closely related and previously unpublished swine influenza isolates. Our results highlight the need for systematic surveillance of influenza in swine, and provide evidence that the mixing of new genetic elements in swine can result in the emergence of viruses with pandemic potential in humans(2).","[Lycett, Samantha J.; Raghwani, Jayna; Rambaut, Andrew] Univ Edinburgh, Ashworth Labs, Inst Evolutionary Biol, Edinburgh EH9 3JT, Midlothian, Scotland; [Smith, Gavin J.

One such gene is Down's syndrome candidate region-1 (DSCR1, also known as RCAN1), which encodes a protein that suppresses vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF)mediated angiogenic signalling by the calcineurin pathway(5-10). Here we show that DSCR1 is increased in Down's syndrome tissues and in a mouse model of Down's syndrome. Furthermore, we show that the modest increase in expression afforded by a single extra transgenic copy of Dscr1 is sufficient to confer significant suppression of tumour growth in mice, and that such resistance is a consequence of a deficit in tumour angiogenesis arising from suppression of the calcineurin pathway. We also provide evidence that attenuation of calcineurin activity by DSCR1, together with another chromosome 21 gene Dyrk1a, may be sufficient to markedly diminish angiogenesis. These data provide a mechanism for the reduced cancer incidence in Down's syndrome and identify the calcineurin signalling pathway, and its regulators DSCR1 and DYRK1A, as potential therapeutic targets in cancers arising in all individuals.","[Baek, Kwan-Hyuck; Zaslavsky, Alexander; Lynch, Ryan C.; Britt, Carmella; Folkman, Judah; Ryeom, Sandra] Childrens Hosp Boston, Dept Surg, Vasc Biol Program, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Okada, Yoshiaki; Aird, William C.] Beth Israel Deaconess Med Ctr, Div Mol & Vasc Med, Vasc Biol Res Ctr, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Siarey, Richard J.; Galdzicki, Zygmunt] Uniformed Serv Univ Hlth Serv, Sch Med, Mol & Cellular Biol Program, Dept Anat Physiol & Genet Neurosci, Bethesda, MD 20814 USA; [Lensch, M.

After initiation of the heartbeat in vertebrates, cells lining the ventral aspect of the dorsal aorta, the placental vessels, and the umbilical and vitelline arteries initiate expression of the transcription factor Runx1 (refs 3-5), a master regulator of haematopoiesis, and give rise to haematopoietic cells(4). It remains unknown whether the biomechanical forces imposed on the vascular wall at this developmental stage act as a determinant of haematopoietic potential(6). Here, using mouse embryonic stem cells differentiated in vitro, we show that fluid shear stress increases the expression of Runx1 in CD41(+)c-Kit(+) haematopoietic progenitor cells(7), concomitantly augmenting their haematopoietic colony-forming potential. Moreover, we find that shear stress increases haematopoietic colony-forming potential and expression of haematopoietic markers in the para-aortic splanchnopleura/aorta-gonads-mesonephros of mouse embryos and that abrogation of nitric oxide, a mediator of shear-stress-induced signalling(8), compromises haematopoietic potential in vitro and in vivo.

Thus, cellular auxin levels often determine the developmental output of auxin signalling. Conceptually, transmembrane transport and metabolic processes regulate the steady-state levels of auxin in any given cell(2,3). In particular, PIN auxin-efflux-carrier-mediated, directional transport between cells is crucial for generating auxin gradients(2,4,5). Here we show that Arabidopsis thaliana PIN5, an atypical member of the PIN gene family, encodes a functional auxin transporter that is required for auxin-mediated development. PIN5 does not have a direct role in cell-to-cell transport but regulates intracellular auxin homeostasis and metabolism. PIN5 localizes, unlike other characterized plasma membrane PIN proteins, to endoplasmic reticulum ( ER), presumably mediating auxin flow from the cytosol to the lumen of the ER. The ER localization of other PIN5-like transporters ( including the moss PIN) indicates that the diversification of PIN protein functions in mediating auxin homeostasis at the ER, and cell-to-cell auxin transport at the plasma membrane, represent an ancient event during the evolution of land plants.","[Mravec, Jozef; Bielach, Agnieszka; Zhang, Jing; Benkova, Eva; Friml, Jiri] Univ Ghent VIB, Dept Plant Syst Biol, B-9052 Ghent, Belgium; [Mravec, Jozef; Bielach, Agnieszka; Zhang, Jing; Benkova, Eva; Friml, Jiri] Univ Ghent, Dept Plant Biotechnol & Genet, B-9052 Ghent, Belgium; [Mravec, Jozef; Zhang, Jing; Gaykova, Vassilena; Stierhof, York-Dieter] Univ Tubingen, Ctr Plant Mol Biol ZMBP, D-72076 Tubingen, Germany; [Skupa, Petr; Hoyerova, Klara; Krecek, Pavel; Petrasek, Jan; Dobrev, Petre I.; Seifertova, Daniela; Zazimalova, Eva] ASCR, Inst Expt Bot, Prague 16502 6, Czech Republic; [Bailly, Aurelien; Geisler, Markus] Univ Zurich, Inst Plant Biol, Zurich Basel Plant Sci Ctr, CH-8008 Zurich, Switzerland; [Petrasek, Jan; Schwarzerova, Katerina] Charles Univ Prague, Fac Sci, Dept Plant Physiol, CR-12844 Prague 2, Czech Republic; [Rolcik, Jakub] ASCR, Inst Expt Bot, Lab Growth Regulators, Olomouc 78371, Czech Republic; [Rolcik, Jakub] Palacky Univ, Fac Sci, Olomouc 78371, Czech Republic; [Luschnig, Christian] Univ Nat Resources & Appl Life Sci BOKU, Dept Appl Genet & Cell Biol, A-1190 Vienna, Austria; [Friml, Jiri] Masaryk Univ, Fac Sci, Dept Funct Genom & Prote, Brno 62500, Czech Republic","Friml, J (reprint author), Univ Ghent VIB, Dept Plant Syst Biol, B-9052 Ghent, Belgium.",jiri.friml@psb.vib-ugent.be,"Schwarzerova, Katerina/D-3989-2009; Petrasek, Jan/C-8240-2009; Geisler, Markus/B-3921-2012; Friml, Jiri/D-9511-2012; Benkova, Eva/E-2910-2012; Hoyerova, Klara/F-6800-2014; Skupa, Petr/H-2176-2014; Dobrev, Petre/H-2391-2014; Zazimalova, Eva/G-7432-2014; Mravec, Jozef/J-7370-2016","Schwarzerova, Katerina/0000-0001-5269-9499; Petrasek, Jan/0000-0002-6719-2735; Mravec, Jozef/0000-0003-0331-3304","Volkswagenstiftung; Odysseus programme of the FWO [IAA601630703, KJB600380604]; Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports of the Czech Republic [LC06034, MSM6198959216]; European Research Council starting independent research grant; Novartis Foundation; Swiss National Funds; Forschungskredit of the University of Zurich; Austrian Science Fund","We thank D.

Many questions remain concerning the full complement and the function of the proteins that regulate cell polarity(1). Here we report that the Drosophila FERM proteins Yurt (Yrt)(2) and Coracle (Cora)(3) and the membrane proteins Neurexin IV(Nrx-IV)(4) and Na+,K+-ATPase(5) are a new group of functionally cooperating epithelial polarity proteins. This 'Yrt/Cora group' promotes basolateral membrane stability and shows negative regulatory interactions with the apical determinant Crumbs (Crb). Genetic analyses indicate that Nrx-IV and Na+,K+-ATPase act together with Cora in one pathway, whereas Yrt acts in a second redundant pathway. Moreover, we show that the Yrt/Cora group is essential for epithelial polarity during organogenesis but not when epithelial polarity is first established or during terminal differentiation. This property of Yrt/Cora group proteins explains the recovery of polarity in embryos lacking the function of the Lethal giant larvae (Lgl) group of basolateral polarity proteins(6,7). We also find that the mammalian Yrt orthologue EPB41L5 ( also known as YMO1 and Limulus)(8-10) is required for lateral membrane formation, indicating a conserved function of Yrt proteins in epithelial polarity.","[Laprise, Patrick; Harris, Kathryn P.; Beronja, Slobodan; Tepass, Ulrich] Univ Toronto, Dept Cell & Syst Biol, Toronto, ON M5S 3G5, Canada; [Lau, Kimberly M.; Silva-Gagliardi, Nancy F.; McGlade, C.

It also has important roles in the regulation of cell growth and proliferation, and in the establishment and maintenance of cell polarity(3). These important functions have rendered AMPK an important drug target for obesity, type 2 diabetes and cancer treatments(4). However, the regulatory mechanism of AMPK activity by AMP binding remains unsolved. Here we report the crystal structures of an unphosphorylated fragment of the AMPK alpha-subunit (KD-AID) from Schizosaccharomyces pombe that contains both the catalytic kinase domain and an autoinhibitory domain (AID), and of a phosphorylated kinase domain from Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Snf1-pKD). The AID binds, from the 'backside', to the hinge region of its kinase domain, forming contacts with both amino-terminal and carboxy-terminal lobes. Structural analyses indicate that AID binding might constrain the mobility of helix alpha C, hence resulting in an autoinhibited KD-AID with much lower kinase activity than that of the kinase domain alone. AMP activates AMPK both allosterically and by inhibiting dephosphorylation(5,6). Further in vitro kinetic studies demonstrate that disruption of the KD-AID interface reverses the autoinhibition and these AMPK heterotrimeric mutants no longer respond to the change in AMP concentration. The structural and biochemical data have shown the primary mechanism of AMPK autoinhibition and suggest a conformational switch model for AMPK activation by AMP.","[Chen, Lei; Jiao, Zhi-Hao; Zhang, Yuan-Yuan; Xie, Shu-Tao; Wang, Zhi-Xin; Wu, Jia-Wei] Tsinghua Univ, Dept Biol Sci & Biotechnol, MOE Key Lab Bioinformat, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China; [Zheng, Li-Sha; Wang, Zhi-Xin] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Biophys, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Zheng, Li-Sha; Wang, Zhi-Xin] Chinese Acad Sci, Grad Univ, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China","Wu, JW (reprint author), Tsinghua Univ, Dept Biol Sci & Biotechnol, MOE Key Lab Bioinformat, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China.",jiaweiwu@mail.tsinghua.edu.cn,,,"MOST [2006CB503900, 2007CB914400]; NSFC [30425005, 30770476]","We thank Y.

The association between high transcription and genome stability is probably due to a variety of factors including an enhanced accumulation of DNA damage, transcription-associated supercoiling, collision between replication forks and the transcription machinery, and the persistence of RNA-DNA hybrids(1). In the case of transcription-associated mutagenesis, we previously showed that there is a direct proportionality between the level of transcription and themutation rate in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae(2), and that the molecular nature of the mutations is affected by highly activated transcription(2,3). Here we show that the accumulation of apurinic/apyrimidinic sites is greatly enhanced in highly transcribed yeast DNA. We further demonstrate that most apurinic/apyrimidinic sites in highly transcribed DNA are derived from the removal of uracil, the presence of which is linked to direct incorporation of dUTP in place of dTTP. These results show an unexpected relationship between transcription and the fidelity of DNA synthesis, and raise intriguing cell biological issues with regard to nucleotide pool compartmentalization.","[Kim, Nayun; Jinks-Robertson, Sue] Duke Univ, Med Ctr, Dept Mol Genet & Microbiol, Durham, NC 27710 USA","Jinks-Robertson, S (reprint author), Duke Univ, Med Ctr, Dept Mol Genet & Microbiol, Durham, NC 27710 USA.",sue.robertson@duke.edu,,,National Institutes of Health [R01 GM038464],We thank S.

This unusual reduction pattern is clearly present in basal theropods, and has also been inferred in non-avian tetanurans based on identification of their three digits as the medial ones of the hand (I-II-III). This contradicts the many developmental studies indicating II-III-IV identities for the three manual digits of the only extant tetanurans, the birds. Here we report a new basal ceratosaur from the Oxfordian stage of the Jurassic period of China (156-161 million years ago), representing the first known Asian ceratosaur and the only known beaked, herbivorous Jurassic theropod. Most significantly, this taxon possesses a strongly reduced manual digit I, documenting a complex pattern of digital reduction within the Theropoda. Comparisons among theropod hands show that the three manual digits of basal tetanurans are similar in many metacarpal features to digits II-III-IV, but in phalangeal features to digits I-II-III, of more basal theropods. Given II-III-IV identities in avians, the simplest interpretation is that these identities were shared by all tetanurans. The transition to tetanurans involved complex changes in the hand including a shift in digit identities, with ceratosaurs displaying an intermediate condition.","[Xu, Xing; Hone, David W.

It has recently emerged as a multifaceted model in pathogenesis. However, how this bacterium switches from a saprophyte to a pathogen is largely unknown. Here, using tiling arrays and RNAs from wild-type and mutant bacteria grown in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo, we have analysed the transcription of its entire genome. We provide the complete Listeria operon map and have uncovered far more diverse types of RNAs than expected: in addition to 50 small RNAs (<500 nucleotides), at least two of which are involved in virulence in mice, we have identified antisense RNAs covering several open-reading frames and long overlapping 59 and 39 untranslated regions. We discovered that riboswitches can act as terminators for upstream genes. When Listeria reaches the host intestinal lumen, an extensive transcriptional reshaping occurs with a SigB-mediated activation of virulence genes.

Remarkably, several non-coding RNAs absent in the non-pathogenic species Listeria innocua exhibit the same expression patterns as the virulence genes.

The geological activity is thought to be the result of tides raised by Jupiter(4), but it is not known whether the current tidal heat production is sufficiently high to generate the observed surface heat flow(5,6). Io's tidal heat comes from the orbital energy of the Io-Jupiter system (resulting in orbital acceleration), whereas dissipation of energy in Jupiter causes Io's orbital motion to decelerate. Here we report a determination of the tidal dissipation in Io and Jupiter through its effect on the orbital motions of the Galilean moons. Our results show that the rate of internal energy dissipation in Io (k(2)/Q = 0.015 +/- 0.003, where k(2) is the Love number and Q is the quality factor) is in good agreement with the observed surface heat flow5,6, and suggest that Io is close to thermal equilibrium. Dissipation in Jupiter (k(2)/Q = (1.102 +/- 0.203) x 10(-5)) is close to the upper bound of its average value expected from the long-term evolution of the system(7), and dissipation in extrasolar planets may be higher than presently assumed(8). The measured secular accelerations indicate that Io is evolving inwards, towards Jupiter, and that the three innermost Galilean moons (Io, Europa and Ganymede) are evolving out of the exact Laplace resonance.","[Lainey, Valery; Arlot, Jean-Eudes] IMCCE Observ Paris, CNRS, UMR 8028, F-75014 Paris, France; [Karatekin, Oezguer; Van Hoolst, Tim] Observ Royal Belgique, B-1180 Brussels, Belgium","Lainey, V (reprint author), IMCCE Observ Paris, CNRS, UMR 8028, 77 Ave Denfert Rochereau, F-75014 Paris, France.",lainey@imcce.fr,,,,,,33,114,115,2,18,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,18-Jun,2009,459,7249,,,,,957,959,,10.1038/nature08108,,3,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,458XS,WOS:000267063500036,19536258,No,,,11/20/17

The main obstacle is the low thermoelectric efficiency of materials for converting heat to electricity, quantified by the thermoelectric figure of merit, ZT. The best available n-type materials for use in mid-temperature (500-900K) thermoelectric generators have a relatively low ZT of 1 or less, and so there is much interest in finding avenues for increasing this figure of merit(1). Here we report a binary crystalline n-type material, In4Se3-delta, which achieves the ZT value of 1.48 at 705K-very high for a bulk material. Using high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, electron diffraction, and first-principles calculations, we demonstrate that this material supports a charge density wave instability which is responsible for the large anisotropy observed in the electric and thermal transport. The high ZT value is the result of the high Seebeck coefficient and the low thermal conductivity in the plane of the charge density wave. Our results suggest a new direction in the search for high-performance thermoelectric materials, exploiting intrinsic nanostructural bulk properties induced by charge density waves.","[Rhyee, Jong-Soo; Lee, Kyu Hyoung; Lee, Sang Mock; Cho, Eunseog; Il Kim, Sang; Lee, Eunsung] Samsung Adv Inst Technol, Mat Res Lab, Yongin 446712, South Korea; [Kwon, Yong Seung] Sungkyunkwan Univ, Dept Phys, Suwon 440746, South Korea; [Shim, Ji Hoon] Pohang Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Chem, Pohang 790784, South Korea; [Kotliar, Gabriel] Rutgers State Univ, Dept Phys & Astron, Piscataway, NJ 08854 USA","Lee, SM (reprint author), Samsung Adv Inst Technol, Mat Res Lab, Yongin 446712, South Korea.",sangmocklee@samsung.com,"Shim, Ji Hoon/F-5375-2013",,WCU [KOSEF: R32-2008-000-10180-0],"We thank D.

During this interval, changes in the Earth's orbit and a long-term drop in atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations(4-6) resulted in both the growth of Antarctic ice sheets to approximately their modern size(2,3) and the appearance of Northern Hemisphere glacial ice(7,8). However, palaeoclimatic studies of this interval are contradictory: although some analyses indicate no major climatic changes(9,10), others imply cooler temperatures(11), increased seasonality(12,13) and/or aridity(12-15). Climatic conditions in high northern latitudes over this interval are particularly poorly known. Here we present northern high-latitude terrestrial climate estimates for the Eocene to Oligocene interval, based on bioclimatic analysis of terrestrially derived spore and pollen assemblages preserved in marine sediments from the Norwegian-Greenland Sea. Our data indicate a cooling of similar to 5 degrees C in cold-month (winter) mean temperatures to 0-2 degrees C, and a concomitant increased seasonality before the Oi-1 glaciation event. These data indicate that a cooling component is indeed incorporated in the delta 18O isotope shift across the Eocene Oligocene transition. However, the relatively warm summer temperatures at that time mean that continental ice on East Greenland was probably restricted to alpine outlet glaciers.","[Eldrett, James S.] Shell Explorat & Prod UK Ltd, Aberdeen AB12 3FY, Scotland; [Greenwood, David R.] Brandon Univ, Dept Biol, Brandon, MB R7A 6A9, Canada; [Harding, Ian C.] Univ Southampton, Natl Oceanog Ctr, Sch Ocean & Earth Sci, Southampton SO14 3ZH, Hants, England; [Huber, Matthew] Purdue Univ, Dept Earth & Atmospher Sci, Purdue Climate Change Res Ctr, W Lafayette, IN 47906 USA","Eldrett, JS (reprint author), Shell Explorat & Prod UK Ltd, 1 Altens Farm Rd, Aberdeen AB12 3FY, Scotland.",james.eldrett@shell.com,"Huber, Matthew/A-7677-2008; Greenwood, David/C-2758-2008; Harding, Ian/K-3320-2012","Huber, Matthew/0000-0002-2771-9977; Greenwood, David/0000-0002-8569-9695; Harding, Ian/0000-0003-4281-0581",US National Science Foundation (NSF); NSERC (Canada),This research used samples provided by the Ocean Drilling Program (ODP).

The importance of this poorly understood feedback is further highlighted by evidence for shear-zone-controlled advective flow of fluids in the ductile lower crust(4) and the recognition that deformation-induced grain-scale porosity is a key to large-scale geodynamics(5,6). Fluid migration in the middle crust cannot be explained in terms of classical concepts. The environment is considered too hot for a dynamic fracture-sustained permeability as in the upper crust(7), and fluid pathways are generally too deformed to be controlled by equilibrium wetting angles that apply to hotter, deeper environments(8-10). Here we present evidence that mechanical and chemical potentials control a syndeformational porosity generation in mid-crustal shear zones. High-resolution synchrotron X-ray tomography and scanning electron microscopy observations allow us to formulate a model for fluid migration in shear zones where a permeable porosity is dynamically created by viscous grain-boundary sliding, creep cavitation, dissolution and precipitation. We propose that syndeformational fluid migration in our 'granular fluid pump' model is a self-sustained process controlled by the explicit role of the rate of entropy production of the underlying irreversible mechanical and chemical microprocesses. The model explains fluid transfer through the middle crust, where strain localization in the creep regime is required for plate tectonics, the formation of giant ore deposits, mantle degassing and earthquake nucleation. Our findings provide a key component for the understanding of creep instabilities in the middle crust.","[Fusseis, F.; Regenauer-Lieb, K.] Univ Western Australia, Sch Earth & Environm, Crawley, WA 6009, Australia; [Regenauer-Lieb, K.; Liu, J.; Hough, R.

While the adjacent Basin and Range province and Rio Grande rift province underwent Cenozoic shortening followed by extension(6), the plateau experienced similar to 2km of rock uplift(7) without significant internal deformation(2-4). Here we propose that warming of the thicker, more iron-depleted Colorado Plateau lithosphere(8-10) over 35-40 Myr following mid-Cenozoic removal of the Farallon plate from beneath North America(11,12) is the primary mechanism driving rock uplift. In our model, conductive re-equilibration not only explains the rock uplift of the plateau, but also provides a robust geodynamic interpretation of observed contrasts between the Colorado Plateau margins and the plateau interior. In particular, the model matches the encroachment of Cenozoic magmatism from the margins towards the plateau interior at rates of 3-6 km Myr(-1) and is consistent with lower seismic velocities(13) and more negative Bouguer gravity(14) at the margins than in the plateau interior. We suggest that warming of heterogeneous lithosphere is a powerful mechanism for driving epeirogenic rock uplift of the Colorado Plateau and may be of general importance in plate-interior settings.","[Roy, Mousumi] Univ New Mexico, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, Albuquerque, NM 87131 USA; [Jordan, Thomas H.] Univ So Calif, Dept Earth Sci, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA; [Pederson, Joel] Utah State Univ, Dept Geol, Logan, UT 84322 USA","Roy, M (reprint author), Univ New Mexico, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, Albuquerque, NM 87131 USA.",mroy@unm.edu,"Roy, Mousumi/I-7141-2012",,"US National Science Foundation (NSF) [EAR0538022, EAR0408513]; Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory","This work was supported by the US National Science Foundation (NSF) grants EAR0538022 and EAR0408513 and an NSF Advance Fellowship from the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory to M.

However, it has recently been argued that empirical studies on the evolution of parasite virulence in spatial populations show otherwise(4-7). In particular, it has been claimed that the evolution of lower virulence in response to limited parasite dispersal(8,9) provides proof of Wynne-Edwards's(10) idea of adaptation at the group level. Although previous theoretical work has shown that limited dispersal can favour lower virulence, it has not clarified why, with five different suggestions having been given(6,8,11-15). Here we show that the effect of dispersal on parasite virulence can be understood entirely within the framework of inclusive fitness theory. Limited parasite dispersal favours lower parasite growth rates and, hence, reduced virulence because it (1) decreases the direct benefit of producing offspring(dispersers are worth more than non-dispersers, because they can go to patches with no or fewer parasites), and (2) increases the competition for hosts experienced by both the focal individual ('self-shading') and their relatives ('kin shading'). This demonstrates that reduced virulence can be understood as an individual-level adaptation by the parasite to maximize its inclusive fitness, and clarifies the links with virulence theory more generally(16).","[Wild, Geoff] Univ Western Ontario, Dept Appl Math, London, ON N6A 5B7, Canada; [Gardner, Andy] Univ Edinburgh, Inst Evolutionary Biol, Edinburgh EH9 3JT, Midlothian, Scotland; [West, Stuart A.] Univ Oxford, Dept Zool, Oxford OX1 3PS, England","Wild, G (reprint author), Univ Western Ontario, Dept Appl Math, London, ON N6A 5B7, Canada.",gwild@uwo.ca,"Gardner, Andy/K-5353-2013; West, Stuart/M-3608-2014","Gardner, Andy/0000-0002-1304-3734; West, Stuart/0000-0003-2152-3153; Wild, Geoff/0000-0001-7821-7304",Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; UK Natural Environmental Research Council; Royal Society; Leverhulme Trust; European Research Council,"We thank M.

We then replicated significant observations in two independent sample sets comprised of a total of 595 cases and 3,357 controls. Here we describe the identification of a common CNV at chromosome 1q21.1 associated with neuroblastoma in the discovery set, which was confirmed in both replication sets. This CNV was validated by quantitative polymerase chain reaction, fluorescent in situ hybridization and analysis of matched tumour specimens, and was shown to be heritable in an independent set of 713 cancer-free parent offspring trios. We identified a previously unknown transcript within the CNV that showed high sequence similarity to several neuroblastoma breakpoint family (NBPF) genes(3,4) and represents a new member of this gene family (NBPF23). This transcript was preferentially expressed in fetal brain and fetal sympathetic nervous tissues, and the expression level was strictly correlated with CNV state in neuroblastoma cells. These data demonstrate that inherited copy number variation at 1q21.1 is associated with neuroblastoma and implicate a previously unknown neuroblastoma breakpoint family gene in early tumorigenesis of this childhood cancer.","[Diskin, Sharon J.; Hou, Cuiping; Attiyeh, Edward F.; Laudenslager, Marci; Bosse, Kristopher; Cole, Kristina; Mosse, Yael P.; Wood, Andrew; Lynch, Jill E.; Pecor, Katlyn; Diamond, Maura; Winter, Cynthia; Rappaport, Eric R.; Maris, John M.] Univ Penn, Sch Med, Div Oncol, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Diskin, Sharon J.; Hou, Cuiping; Attiyeh, Edward F.; Laudenslager, Marci; Bosse, Kristopher; Cole, Kristina; Mosse, Yael P.; Wood, Andrew; Lynch, Jill E.; Pecor, Katlyn; Diamond, Maura; Winter, Cynthia; Rappaport, Eric R.; Maris, John M.] Univ Penn, Sch Med, Ctr Childhood Canc Res, Childrens Hosp Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Hou, Cuiping; Glessner, Joseph T.; Wang, Kai; Kim, Cecilia; Bradfield, Jonathan; Grant, Struan F.

Self-incompatibility is an important mechanism used in many species to prevent inbreeding; it is controlled by a multi-allelic S locus(1,2). 'Self' (incompatible) pollen is discriminated from 'non-self' (compatible) pollen by interaction of pollen and pistil S locus components, and is subsequently inhibited. In Papaver rhoeas, the pistil S locus product is a small protein that interacts with incompatible pollen, triggering a Ca2+-dependent signalling network, resulting in pollen inhibition and programmed cell death(3-7). Here we have cloned three alleles of a highly polymorphic pollen-expressed gene, PrpS (Papaver rhoeas pollen S), from Papaver and provide evidence that this encodes the pollen S locus determinant. PrpS is a single-copy gene linked to the pistil S gene (currently called S, but referred to hereafter as PrsS for Papaver rhoeas stigma S determinant). Sequence analysis indicates that PrsS and PrpS are equally ancient and probably co-evolved. PrpS encodes a novel similar to 20-kDa protein. Consistent with predictions that it is a transmembrane protein, PrpS is associated with the plasma membrane. We show that a predicted extracellular loop segment of PrpS interacts with PrsS and, using PrpS antisense oligonucleotides, we demonstrate that PrpS is involved in S-specific inhibition of incompatible pollen. Identification of PrpS represents a major advance in our understanding of the Papaver self-incompatibility system. As a novel cell-cell recognition determinant it contributes to the available information concerning the origins and evolution of cell-cell recognition systems involved in discrimination between self and non-self, which also include histocompatibility systems in primitive chordates and vertebrates.","[Wheeler, Michael J.; de Graaf, Barend H.

Wound detection and healing represent a dormant morphogenetic program that can be rapidly executed to restore barrier integrity and tissue homeostasis. In animals, initial steps include recruitment of leukocytes to the site of injury across distances of hundreds of micrometres within minutes of wounding. The spatial signals that direct this immediate tissue response are unknown. Owing to their fast diffusion and versatile biological activities, reactive oxygen species, including hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), are interesting candidates for wound-to-leukocyte signalling. Here we probe the role of H2O2 during the early events of wound responses in zebrafish larvae expressing a genetically encoded H2O2 sensor(1). This reporter revealed a sustained rise in H2O2 concentration at the wound margin, starting similar to 3 min after wounding and peaking at similar to 20 min, which extended similar to 100-200 mu m into the tail-fin epithelium as a decreasing concentration gradient. Using pharmacological and genetic inhibition, we show that this gradient is created by dual oxidase (Duox), and that it is required for rapid recruitment of leukocytes to the wound. This is the first observation, to our knowledge, of a tissue-scale H2O2 pattern, and the first evidence that H2O2 signals to leukocytes in tissues, in addition to its known antiseptic role.","[Niethammer, Philipp; Mitchison, Timothy J.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Syst Biol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Grabher, Clemens; Look, A.

T-ALL patients present at diagnosis with increased white cell counts and hepatosplenomegaly, and are at an increased risk of central nervous system (CNS) relapse(2,3). For that reason, T-ALL patients usually receive cranial irradiation in addition to intensified intrathecal chemotherapy. The marked increase in survival is thought to be worth the considerable side-effects associated with this therapy. Such complications include secondary tumours, neurocognitive deficits, endocrine disorders and growth impairment(3). Little is known about the mechanism of leukaemic cell infiltration of the CNS, despite its clinical importance(4). Here we show, using T-ALL animal modelling and gene-expression profiling, that the chemokine receptor CCR7 (ref. 5) is the essential adhesion signal required for the targeting of leukaemic T-cells into the CNS. Ccr7 gene expression is controlled by the activity of the T-ALL oncogene Notch1 and is expressed in human tumours carrying Notch1-activating mutations. Silencing of either CCR7 or its chemokine ligand CCL19 (ref. 6) in an animal model of T-ALL specifically inhibits CNS infiltration. Furthermore, murine CNS-targeting by human T-ALL cells depends on their ability to express CCR7. These studies identify a single chemokine-receptor interaction as a CNS 'entry' signal, and open the way for future pharmacological targeting. Targeted inhibition of CNS involvement in T-ALL could potentially decrease the intensity of CNS-targeted therapy, thus reducing its associated short- and long-term complications.","[Buonamici, Silvia; Trimarchi, Thomas; Ruocco, Maria Grazia; Reavie, Linsey; Cathelin, Severine; Lukyanov, Yevgeniy; Tseng, Jen-Chieh; Sen, Filiz; Newcomb, Elizabeth; Zavadil, Jiri; Meruelo, Daniel; Ibrahim, Sherif; Zagzag, David; Dustin, Michael L.; Aifantis, Iannis] NYU, Sch Med, Dept Pathol, New York, NY 10016 USA; [Buonamici, Silvia; Trimarchi, Thomas; Ruocco, Maria Grazia; Reavie, Linsey; Cathelin, Severine; Lukyanov, Yevgeniy; Tseng, Jen-Chieh; Sen, Filiz; Newcomb, Elizabeth; Zavadil, Jiri; Meruelo, Daniel; Ibrahim, Sherif; Zagzag, David; Dustin, Michael L.; Aifantis, Iannis] NYU, Sch Med, Inst Canc, New York, NY 10016 USA; [Buonamici, Silvia; Trimarchi, Thomas; Reavie, Linsey; Cathelin, Severine; Sen, Filiz; Aifantis, Iannis] NYU, Sch Med, Helen L & Martin S Kimmel Stem Cell Ctr, New York, NY 10016 USA; [Ruocco, Maria Grazia; Dustin, Michael L.] NYU, Sch Med, Program Mol Pathogenesis,Skirball Inst Biomol Med, Helen L & Martin S Kimmel Ctr Biol & Med, New York, NY 10016 USA; [Mar, Brenton G.] Columbia Univ, Med Ctr, Dept Pediat, New York, NY 10032 USA; [Klinakis, Apostolos; Efstratiadis, Argiris] Columbia Univ, Med Ctr, Dept Genet & Dev, New York, NY 10032 USA; [Gehrie, Eric; Bromberg, Jonathan S.] Mt Sinai Sch Med, Dept Gene & Cell Med, New York, NY 10029 USA; [Gehrie, Eric; Bromberg, Jonathan S.] Mt Sinai Sch Med, Inst Immunol, New York, NY 10029 USA; [Li, Mengling] NYU, Inst Canc, Div Biostat, New York, NY 10016 USA; [Lipp, Martin] Max Delbruck Ctr Mol Med, Dept Tumor Genet & Immunogenet, D-13092 Berlin, Germany","Aifantis, I (reprint author), NYU, Sch Med, Dept Pathol, New York, NY 10016 USA.",iannis.aifantis@nyumc.org,"Lipp, Martin/G-2235-2010","Mar, Brenton/0000-0002-3857-9324; Gehrie, Eric/0000-0002-5354-3899; Dustin, Michael/0000-0003-4983-6389; Zavadil, Jiri/0000-0003-0640-5562","National Institutes of Health [RO1CA105129, RO1CA133379, R56AI070310, P30CA016087, RO1AI41428, RO1AI072039]; American Cancer Society [RSG0806801]; Dana Foundation; Chemotherapy Foundation; Alex's Lemonade Stand Foundation; Lauri Strauss Leukemia Foundation; GP Foundation; NYU Molecular Oncology and Immunology; American Society of Hematology; Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation [JDRFI1-2008-90, 5-2008-236]; National Cancer Institute [1 P01 CA97403]; Berrie Foundation; Jane Coffin Childs Memorial Fund for Medical Research","We are grateful to G.

Brain relapse typically occurs years after the removal of a breast tumour(2-4), suggesting that disseminated cancer cells must acquire specialized functions to take over this organ. Here we show that breast cancer metastasis to the brain involves mediators of extravasation through non-fenestrated capillaries, complemented by specific enhancers of blood-brain barrier crossing and brain colonization. We isolated cells that preferentially infiltrate the brain from patients with advanced disease. Gene expression analysis of these cells and of clinical samples, coupled with functional analysis, identified the cyclooxygenase COX2 (also known as PTGS2), the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) ligand HBEGF, and the alpha 2,6-sialyltransferase ST6GALNAC5 as mediators of cancer cell passage through the blood-brain barrier. EGFR ligands and COX2 were previously linked to breast cancer infiltration of the lungs, but not the bones or liver(5,6), suggesting a sharing of these mediators in cerebral and pulmonary metastases. In contrast, ST6GALNAC5 specifically mediates brain metastasis. Normally restricted to the brain(7), the expression of ST6GALNAC5 in breast cancer cells enhances their adhesion to brain endothelial cells and their passage through the blood-brain barrier. This co-option of a brain sialyltransferase highlights the role of cell-surface glycosylation in organ-specific metastatic interactions.","[Bos, Paula D.; Zhang, Xiang H. -F.; Nadal, Cristina; Shu, Weiping; Gomis, Roger R.; Nguyen, Don X.; Massague, Joan] Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Canc Biol & Genet Program, New York, NY 10021 USA; [Minn, Andy J.] Univ Chicago, Dept Radiat & Cellular Oncol, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Minn, Andy J.] Univ Chicago, Ludwig Ctr Metastasis Res, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [van de Vijver, Marc J.] Univ Amsterdam, Acad Med Ctr, Dept Pathol, NL-1105 AZ Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Gerald, William L.] Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Dept Pathol, New York, NY 10021 USA; [Foekens, John A.] Erasmus MC, Josephine Nefkens Inst, Dept Med Oncol, Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Foekens, John A.] Canc Genom Ctr, Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Massague, Joan] Howard Hughes Med Inst, Chevy Chase, MD 20185 USA","Massague, J (reprint author), Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Canc Biol & Genet Program, 1275 York Ave, New York, NY 10021 USA.",j-massague@ski.mskcc.org,"Gomis, Roger/E-9788-2016","Gomis, Roger/0000-0001-6473-2858; Massague, Joan/0000-0001-9324-8408",National Institutes of Health [U54 CA126518]; Kleberg Foundation and the Hearst Foundation; Netherlands Genomics Initiative (NGI)/Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO); Howard Hughes Medical Institute,"This work is dedicated to the memory of our colleague W.

However, the regulatory mechanisms by which primary miRNAs (pri-miRNAs) are processed first to precursor miRNAs (pre-miRNAs) and then to mature miRNAs by the multiprotein Drosha and Dicer complexes(5-8), respectively, remain largely unknown. The KH-type splicing regulatory protein (KSRP, also known as KHSRP) interacts with single-strand AU-rich-element-containing mRNAs and is a key mediator of mRNA decay(9,10). Here we show in mammalian cells that KSRP also serves as a component of both Drosha and Dicer complexes and regulates the biogenesis of a subset of miRNAs. KSRP binds with high affinity to the terminal loop of the target miRNA precursors and promotes their maturation. This mechanism is required for specific changes in target mRNA expression that affect specific biological programs, including proliferation, apoptosis and differentiation. These findings reveal an unexpected mechanism that links KSRP to the machinery regulating maturation of a cohort of miRNAs that, in addition to its role in promoting mRNA decay, independently serves to integrate specific regulatory programs of protein expression.","[Trabucchi, Michele; Rosenfeld, Michael G.] Univ Calif San Diego, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Dept & Sch Med, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Briata, Paola; Gherzi, Roberto] Ist Nazl Ric Canc IST, I-16132 Genoa, Italy; [Garcia-Mayoral, MariaFlor; Ramos, Andres] Natl Inst Med Res, Div Mol Struct, London NW7 1AA, England; [Haase, Astrid D.; Filipowicz, Witold] Friedrich Miescher Inst Biomed Res, CH-4002 Basel, Switzerland","Rosenfeld, MG (reprint author), Univ Calif San Diego, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Dept & Sch Med, 9500 Gilman Dr,Room 345, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.",aramos@nimr.mrc.ac.uk; rgherzi@ucsd.edu; mrosenfeld@ucsd.edu,,,"Italian ISS [527B/2B/6]; AIRC; CIPE; ISS [526D/39]; EC; NIH [DK018477, DK39949, HL065445]; AICF; Wellcome Trust [WT022088MA]; Novartis Research Foundation; Fondazione Telethon","We thank V.

BLUF is a recently identified photoreceptor protein domain that senses blue light using a FAD chromophore(1). BLUF domains are present in various proteins from the Bacteria, Euglenozoa and Fungi. Although structures of single-domain BLUF proteins have been determined(2-4), none are available for a BLUF protein containing a functional output domain; the mechanism of light activation in this new class of photoreceptors has thus remained poorly understood. Here we report the biochemical, structural and mechanistic characterization of a full-length, active photoreceptor, BlrP1 (also known as KPN_01598), from Klebsiella pneumoniae(5). BlrP1 consists of a BLUF sensor domain and a phosphodiesterase EAL output domain which hydrolyses cyclic dimeric GMP (c-di-GMP). This ubiquitous second messenger controls motility, biofilm formation, virulence and antibiotic resistance in the Bacteria(6-9). Crystal structures of BlrP1 complexed with its substrate and metal ions involved in catalysis or in enzyme inhibition provide a detailed understanding of the mechanism of the EAL-domain c-di-GMP phosphodiesterases. These structures also sketch out a path of light activation of the phosphodiesterase output activity. Photon absorption by the BLUF domain of one subunit of the antiparallel BlrP1 homodimer activates the EAL domain of the second subunit through allosteric communication transmitted through conserved domain-domain interfaces.","[Kirienko, Natalia V.; Ryjenkov, Dmitri A.; Gomelsky, Mark] Univ Wyoming, Dept Mol Biol, Laramie, WY 82071 USA; [Barends, Thomas R.

Highly diverse VLR genes are somatically assembled by the insertion of variable LRR sequences into incomplete germline VLRA and VLRB genes. Here we show that in sea lampreys (Petromyzon marinus) VLRA and VLRB anticipatory receptors are expressed by separate lymphocyte populations by monoallelic VLRA or VLRB assembly, together with expression of cytosine deaminase 1 (CDA1) or 2 (CDA2), respectively. Distinctive gene expression profiles for VLRA(+) and VLRB(+) lymphocytes resemble those of mammalian T and B cells. Although both the VLRA and the VLRB cells proliferate in response to antigenic stimulation, only the VLRB lymphocytes bind native antigens and differentiate into VLR antibody-secreting cells. Conversely, VLRA lymphocytes respond preferentially to a classical T-cell mitogen and upregulate the expression of the pro-inflammatory cytokine genes interleukin-17 (IL-17) and macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF).

Sirtuins, a group of conserved NAD(+)-dependent deacetylases or ADP-ribosyltransferases, promote longevity in diverse organisms; however, their molecular mechanisms in ageing regulation remain poorly understood. Yeast Sir2, the first member of the family to be found, establishes and maintains chromatin silencing by removing histone H4 lysine 16 acetylation and bringing in other silencing proteins. Here we report an age-associated decrease in Sir2 protein abundance accompanied by an increase in H4 lysine 16 acetylation and loss of histones at specific subtelomeric regions in replicatively old yeast cells, which results in compromised transcriptional silencing at these loci. Antagonizing activities of Sir2 and Sas2, a histone acetyltransferase, regulate the replicative lifespan through histone H4 lysine 16 at subtelomeric regions. This pathway, distinct from existing ageing models for yeast, may represent an evolutionarily conserved function of sirtuins in regulation of replicative ageing by maintenance of intact telomeric chromatin.","[Dang, Weiwei; Perry, Rocco; Dorsey, Jean A.; Berger, Shelley L.] Wistar Inst Anat & Biol, Gene Express & Regulat Program, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Kaeberlein, Matt] Univ Washington, Dept Pathol, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Steffen, Kristan K.; Kennedy, Brian K.] Univ Washington, Dept Biochem, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Johnson, F.

Here we report the optical and near-infrared transmission spectrum of the Earth, obtained during a lunar eclipse. Some biologically relevant atmospheric features that are weak in the reflection spectrum(9) (such as ozone, molecular oxygen, water, carbon dioxide and methane) are much stronger in the transmission spectrum, and indeed stronger than predicted by modelling(10,11).

This conclusion, however, was established either with averaged equations(1,2) that are not appropriate near the collisions or with non-relativistic models in which the resonance effect is greatly enhanced by a decrease of the perihelion velocity of Mercury(2,3). In these previous studies, the Earth's orbit was essentially unaffected. Here we report numerical simulations of the evolution of the Solar System over 5 Gyr, including contributions from the Moon and general relativity. In a set of 2,501 orbits with initial conditions that are in agreement with our present knowledge of the parameters of the Solar System, we found, as in previous studies(2), that one per cent of the solutions lead to a large increase in Mercury's eccentricity-an increase large enough to allow collisions with Venus or the Sun. More surprisingly, in one of these high-eccentricity solutions, a subsequent decrease in Mercury's eccentricity induces a transfer of angular momentum from the giant planets that destabilizes all the terrestrial planets similar to 3.34 Gyr from now, with possible collisions of Mercury, Mars or Venus with the Earth.","[Laskar, J.; Gastineau, M.] UPMC, Observ Paris, IMCCE CNRS, UMR8028, F-75014 Paris, France","Laskar, J (reprint author), UPMC, Observ Paris, IMCCE CNRS, UMR8028, 77 Ave Denfert Rochereau, F-75014 Paris, France.",laskar@imcce.fr,"Laskar, Jacques/E-1098-2011","Laskar, Jacques/0000-0003-2634-789X",French National Research Centre; Paris Observatory; National Research Agency,"This work benefited from support from the Planetology Programme of the French National Research Centre, from Paris Observatory and from National Research Agency grant ASTS-CM.

As such, it has a central role in modern device physics and technology and governs the operation of semiconductor devices such as p-n junctions, transistors, photodiodes and lasers(1). A tunable bandgap would be highly desirable because it would allow great flexibility in design and optimization of such devices, in particular if it could be tuned by applying a variable external electric field. However, in conventional materials, the bandgap is fixed by their crystalline structure, preventing such bandgap control. Here we demonstrate the realization of a widely tunable electronic bandgap in electrically gated bilayer graphene. Using a dual-gate bilayer graphene field-effect transistor (FET)(2) and infrared microspectroscopy(3-5), we demonstrate a gate-controlled, continuously tunable bandgap of up to 250 meV. Our technique avoids uncontrolled chemical doping(6-8) and provides direct evidence of a widely tunable bandgap-spanning a spectral range from zero to mid-infrared-that has eluded previous attempts(2,9). Combined with the remarkable electrical transport properties of such systems, this electrostatic bandgap control suggests novel nanoelectronic and nanophotonic device applications based on graphene.","[Zhang, Yuanbo; Tang, Tsung-Ta; Girit, Caglar; Zettl, Alex; Crommie, Michael F.; Shen, Y.

Although they possess a seemingly endless variety of architectural complexities, the biosynthesis of terpenes often occurs in a unified fashion as a 'two-phase' process(2,3). In the first phase (the cyclase phase), simple linear hydrocarbon phosphate building blocks are stitched together by means of 'prenyl coupling', followed by enzymatically controlled molecular cyclizations and rearrangements. In the second phase (the oxidase phase), oxidation of alkenes and carbon-hydrogen bonds results in a large array of structural diversity. Although organic chemists have made great progress in developing the logic(3-5) needed for the cyclase phase of terpene synthesis, particularly in the area of polyene cyclizations(6), much remains to be learned if the oxidase phase is to be mimicked in the laboratory. Here we show how the logic of terpene biosynthesis has inspired the highly efficient and stereocontrolled syntheses of five oxidized members of the eudesmane family of terpenes in a modicum of steps by a series of simple carbocycle-forming reactions followed by multiple site-selective inter-and intramolecular carbon-hydrogen oxidations. This work establishes an intellectual framework in which to conceive the laboratory synthesis of other complex terpenes using a 'two-phase' approach.","[Chen, Ke; Baran, Phil S.] Scripps Res Inst, Dept Chem, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA","Baran, PS (reprint author), Scripps Res Inst, Dept Chem, 10550 N Torrey Pines Rd, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA.",pbaran@scripps.edu,,,Bristol-Myers Squibb,"We are grateful to A.

These approaches, however, do not account for carbon cycle feedbacks and therefore do not fully represent the net response of the Earth system to anthropogenic CO2 emissions. Climate-carbon modelling experiments have shown that: (1) the warming per unit CO2 emitted does not depend on the background CO2 concentration(2); (2) the total allowable emissions for climate stabilization do not depend on the timing of those emissions(3-5); and (3) the temperature response to a pulse of CO2 is approximately constant on timescales of decades to centuries(3,6-8). Here we generalize these results and show that the carbon-climate response (CCR), defined as the ratio of temperature change to cumulative carbon emissions, is approximately independent of both the atmospheric CO2 concentration and its rate of change on these timescales. From observational constraints, we estimate CCR to be in the range 1.0-2.1 degrees C per trillion tonnes of carbon (Tt C) emitted (5th to 95th percentiles), consistent with twenty-first-century CCR values simulated by climate-carbon models. Uncertainty in land-use CO2 emissions and aerosol forcing, however, means that higher observationally constrained values cannot be excluded. The CCR, when evaluated from climate-carbon models under idealized conditions, represents a simple yet robust metric for comparing models, which aggregates both climate feedbacks and carbon cycle feedbacks. CCR is also likely to be a useful concept for climate change mitigation and policy; by combining the uncertainties associated with climate sensitivity, carbon sinks and climate-carbon feedbacks into a single quantity, the CCR allows CO2-induced global mean temperature change to be inferred directly from cumulative carbon emissions.","[Matthews, H.

Since then, many slow earthquakes have been detected(3-8). It has been suggested(9) that the slow events may trigger ordinary earthquakes (in a context supported by numerical modelling(10)), but their broader significance in terms of earthquake occurrence remains unclear. Triggering of earthquakes has received much attention: strain diffusion from large regional earthquakes has been shown to influence large earthquake activity(11,12), and earthquakes may be triggered during the passage of teleseismic waves(13), a phenomenon now recognized as being common(14-17). Here we show that, in eastern Taiwan, slow earthquakes can be triggered by typhoons. We model the largest of these earthquakes as repeated episodes of slow slip on a reverse fault just under land and dipping to the west; the characteristics of all events are sufficiently similar that they can be modelled with minor variations of the model parameters. Lower pressure results in a very small unclamping of the fault that must be close to the failure condition for the typhoon to act as a trigger. This area experiences very high compressional deformation but has a paucity of large earthquakes; repeating slow events may be segmenting the stressed area and thus inhibiting large earthquakes, which require a long, continuous seismic rupture.","[Liu, ChiChing] Acad Sinica, Inst Earth Sci, Taipei 115, Taiwan; [Linde, Alan T.; Sacks, I.

These excitatory responses increase as the reward value increases(5). This response property has led to a hypothesis that dopamine neurons encode value-related signals and are inhibited by aversive events. Here we show that this is true only for a subset of dopamine neurons. We recorded the activity of dopamine neurons in monkeys (Macaca mulatta) during a Pavlovian procedure with appetitive and aversive outcomes (liquid rewards and airpuffs directed at the face, respectively). We found that some dopamine neurons were excited by reward-predicting stimuli and inhibited by airpuff-predicting stimuli, as the value hypothesis predicts. However, a greater number of dopamine neurons were excited by both of these stimuli, inconsistent with the hypothesis. Some dopamine neurons were also excited by both rewards and airpuffs themselves, especially when they were unpredictable. Neurons excited by the airpuff-predicting stimuli were located more dorsolaterally in the substantia nigra pars compacta, whereas neurons inhibited by the stimuli were located more ventromedially, some in the ventral tegmental area. A similar anatomical difference was observed for their responses to actual airpuffs. These findings suggest that different groups of dopamine neurons convey motivational signals in distinct manners.","[Matsumoto, Masayuki; Hikosaka, Okihide] NEI, Sensorimotor Res Lab, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA","Matsumoto, M (reprint author), NEI, Sensorimotor Res Lab, NIH, Bldg 10, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA.",matsumotom@nei.nih.gov,,,"Intramural Research Program at the National Institutes of Health, National Eye Institute","We thank S.

The organization of these circuits shows several levels of specificity. Only certain classes of proprioceptive sensory neurons make direct, monosynaptic connections with motor neurons(4). Those that do are bound by rules of motor pool specificity: they form strong connections with motor neurons supplying the same muscle, but avoid motor pools supplying antagonistic muscles(1,5-7). This pattern of connectivity is initially accurate and is maintained in the absence of activity(8), implying that wiring specificity relies on the matching of recognition molecules on the surface of sensory and motor neurons. However, determinants of fine synaptic specificity here, as in most regions of the central nervous system, have yet to be defined. To address the origins of synaptic specificity in these reflex circuits we have used molecular genetic methods to manipulate recognition proteins expressed by subsets of sensory and motor neurons. We show here that a recognition system involving expression of the class 3 semaphorin Sema3e by selected motor neuron pools, and its high-affinity receptor plexin D1 (Plxnd1) by proprioceptive sensory neurons, is a critical determinant of synaptic specificity in sensory-motor circuits in mice. Changing the profile of Sema3e-Plxnd1 signalling in sensory or motor neurons results in functional and anatomical rewiring of monosynaptic connections, but does not alter motor pool specificity. Our findings indicate that patterns of monosynaptic connectivity in this prototypic central nervous system circuit are constructed through a recognition program based on repellent signalling.","[Pecho-Vrieseling, Eline; Sigrist, Markus; Arber, Silvia] Univ Basel, Dept Cell Biol, Biozentrum, CH-4056 Basel, Switzerland; [Pecho-Vrieseling, Eline; Sigrist, Markus; Arber, Silvia] Friedrich Miescher Inst Biomed Res, CH-4058 Basel, Switzerland; [Yoshida, Yutaka; Jessell, Thomas M.] Columbia Univ, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Dept Neurosci, Kavli Inst Brain Sci, New York, NY 10032 USA; [Yoshida, Yutaka; Jessell, Thomas M.] Columbia Univ, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Dept Biochem & Mol Biophys, Kavli Inst Brain Sci, New York, NY 10032 USA; [Yoshida, Yutaka] Cincinnati Childrens Hosp Med Ctr, Div Dev Biol, Cincinnati, OH 45229 USA","Arber, S (reprint author), Univ Basel, Dept Cell Biol, Biozentrum, CH-4056 Basel, Switzerland.",tmj1@columbia.edu; silvia.arber@unibas.ch,,,Swiss National Science Foundation; NCCR Frontiers in Genetics; Kanton Basel-Stadt; EU Framework Program 7; Novartis Research Foundation; NIH [RO1NS065048]; NINDS; Harold and Leila Mathers Foundation; Wellcome Trust,"We thank D.

The biological meaning of H3K4me is interpreted by conserved modules including plant homeodomain (PHD) fingers that recognize varied H3K4me states(1,2). The dysregulation of PHD fingers has been implicated in several human diseases, including cancers and immune or neurological disorders(3). Here we report that fusing an H3K4-trimethylation (H3K4me3)binding PHD finger, such as the carboxy-terminal PHD finger of PHF23 or JARID1A (also known as KDM5A or RBBP2), to a common fusion partner nucleoporin-98 (NUP98) as identified in human leukaemias(4,5), generated potent oncoproteins that arrested haematopoietic differentiation and induced acute myeloid leukaemia in murine models. In these processes, a PHD finger that specifically recognizes H3K4me3/2 marks was essential for leukaemogenesis. Mutations in PHD fingers that abrogated H3K4me3 binding also abolished leukaemic transformation. NUP98-PHD fusion prevented the differentiation-associated removal of H3K4me3 at many loci encoding lineage-specific transcription factors (Hox(s), Gata3, Meis1, Eya1 and Pbx1), and enforced their active gene transcription in murine haematopoietic stem/progenitor cells. Mechanistically, NUP98-PHD fusions act as 'chromatin boundary factors', dominating over polycomb-mediated gene silencing to 'lock' developmentally critical loci into an active chromatin state (H3K4me3 with induced histone acetylation), a state that defined leukaemia stem cells. Collectively, our studies represent, to our knowledge, the first report that deregulation of the PHD finger, an 'effector' of specific histone modification, perturbs the epigenetic dynamics on developmentally critical loci, catastrophizes cellular fate decision-making, and even causes oncogenesis during mammalian development.","[Wang, Gang G.; Dormann, Holger L.; Casadio, Fabio; Allis, C.

Entry into mitosis depends on the activity of Cdk1, which is inhibited by the Wee1 kinase and activated by the Cdc25 phosphatase(1). However, how cells sense their size for mitotic commitment remains unknown. Here we show that an intracellular gradient of the dual-specificity tyrosine-phosphorylation regulated kinase (DYRK) Pom1, which emanates from the ends of rod-shaped Schizosaccharomyces pombe cells, serves to measure cell length and control mitotic entry. Pom1 provides positional information both for polarized growth and to inhibit cell division at cell ends(2-5). We discovered that Pom1 is also a dose-dependent G2-M inhibitor. Genetic analyses indicate that Pom1 negatively regulates Cdr1 and Cdr2, two previously described Wee1 inhibitors of the SAD kinase family(6-10). This inhibition may be direct, because in vivo and in vitro evidence suggest that Pom1 phosphorylates Cdr2. Whereas Cdr1 and Cdr2 localize to a medial cortical region, Pom1 forms concentration gradients from cell tips that overlap with Cdr1 and Cdr2 in short cells, but not in long cells. Disturbing these Pom1 gradients leads to Cdr2 phosphorylation and imposes a G2 delay. In short cells, Pom1 prevents precocious M-phase entry, suggesting that the higher medial Pom1 levels inhibit Cdr2 and promote a G2 delay. Thus, gradients of Pom1 from cell ends provide a measure of cell length to regulate M-phase entry.","[Martin, Sophie G.; Berthelot-Grosjean, Martine] Univ Lausanne, Fac Biol & Med, Ctr Integrat Genom, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland","Martin, SG (reprint author), Univ Lausanne, Fac Biol & Med, Ctr Integrat Genom, Genopode Bldg, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland.",Sophie.Martin@unil.ch,,"Martin, Sophie/0000-0002-5317-2557",Swiss National Science Foundation Professorship [PP00A-114936]; Human Frontiers Science Program Career Development Award [CDA0016/2008],"We wish to thank J.

The proteins that control Cdk1 activity are well described but their links with mechanisms monitoring cell size remain elusive. In the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, cells enter mitosis and divide at a defined and reproducible size owing to the regulated activity of Cdk1 (refs 2, 3). Here we show that the cell polarity protein kinase Pom1, which localizes to cell ends(5), regulates a signalling network that contributes to the control of mitotic entry. This network is located at cortical nodes in the middle of interphase cells, and these nodes contain the Cdk1 inhibitor Wee1, the Wee1-inhibitory kinases Cdr1 (also known as Nim1) and Cdr2, and the anillin-like protein Mid1. Cdr2 establishes the hierarchical localization of other proteins in the nodes, and receives negative regulatory signals from Pom1. Pom1 forms a polar gradient extending from the cell ends towards the cell middle and acts as a dose-dependent inhibitor of mitotic entry, working through the Cdr2 pathway. As cells elongate, Pom1 levels decrease at the cell middle, leading to mitotic entry. We propose that the Pom1 polar gradient and the medial cortical nodes generate information about cell size and coordinate this with mitotic entry by regulating Cdk1 through Pom1, Cdr2, Cdr1 and Wee1.","[Moseley, James B.; Nurse, Paul] Rockefeller Univ, New York, NY 10065 USA; [Mayeux, Adeline; Paoletti, Anne] CNRS, UMR144, F-75248 Paris 05, France; [Mayeux, Adeline; Paoletti, Anne] Ctr Rech, Inst Curie, F-75248 Paris 05, France","Moseley, JB (reprint author), Rockefeller Univ, New York, NY 10065 USA.",jmoseley@rockefeller.edu,,,American Cancer Society [PF-07-129-01-MBC]; ANR [BLAN06-3_135468]; ARC [4934]; FRM [INE20071110973]; Breast Cancer Research Foundation; Rockefeller University,"We thank members of the Nurse laboratory for discussions and critical reading of the manuscript, A.

Its regulatory particle (RP) initiates the degradation of ubiquitin-protein conjugates by unfolding the substrate and translocating it into the proteasome core particle (CP) to be degraded(1). The RP has 19 subunits, and their pathway of assembly is not understood. Here we show that in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae three proteins are found associated with RP but not with the RP-CP holoenzyme: Nas6, Rpn14 and Hsm3. Mutations in the corresponding genes confer proteasome loss-of-function phenotypes, despite their virtual absence from the holoenzyme. These effects result from deficient RP assembly. Thus, Nas6, Rpn14 and Hsm3 are RP chaperones. The RP contains six ATPases-the Rpt proteins-and each RP chaperone binds to the carboxy-terminal domain of a specific Rpt. We show in an accompanying study(2) that RP assembly is templated through the Rpt C termini, apparently by their insertion into binding pockets in the CP. Thus, RP chaperones may regulate proteasome assembly by directly restricting the accessibility of Rpt C termini to the CP. In addition, competition between the RP chaperones and the CP for Rpt engagement may explain the release of RP chaperones as proteasomes mature.","[Roelofs, Jeroen; Park, Soyeon; Haas, Wilhelm; Tian, Geng; McAllister, Fiona E.; Huo, Ying; Lee, Byung-Hoon; Gygi, Steven P.; Finley, Daniel] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Cell Biol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Zhang, Fan; Shi, Yigong] Princeton Univ, Lewis Thomas Lab, Dept Mol Biol, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA","Finley, D (reprint author), Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Cell Biol, 240 Longwood Ave, Boston, MA 02115 USA.",daniel_finley@hms.harvard.edu,"Tian, Geng/G-7374-2011","Roelofs, Jeroen/0000-0003-0944-2465","NIH [GM043601, GM67945]; NIH NRSA [5F32GM75737-2]; EMBO","We thank C.

A hetero-hexameric ATPase ring, containing subunits Rpt1-6, is situated within the base subassembly of the regulatory particle(1). The ATPase ring sits atop the CP, with the Rpt carboxy termini inserted into pockets in the CP(2-6). Here we identify a previously unknown function of the Rpt proteins in proteasome biogenesis through deleting the C-terminal residue from each Rpt in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Our results indicate that assembly of the hexameric ATPase ring is templated on the CP. We have also identified an apparent intermediate in base assembly, BP1, which contains Rpn1, three Rpts and Hsm3, a chaperone for base assembly. The Rpt proteins with the strongest assembly phenotypes, Rpt4 and Rpt6, were absent from BP1. We propose that Rpt4 and Rpt6 form a nucleating complex to initiate base assembly, and that this complex is subsequently joined by BP1 to complete the Rpt ring. Our studies show that assembly of the proteasome base is a rapid yet highly orchestrated process.","[Park, Soyeon; Roelofs, Jeroen; Kim, Woong; Robert, Jessica; Gygi, Steven P.; Finley, Daniel] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Cell Biol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Schmidt, Marion] Albert Einstein Coll Med, Dept Biochem, Bronx, NY 10461 USA","Finley, D (reprint author), Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Cell Biol, 240 Longwood Ave, Boston, MA 02115 USA.",daniel_finley@hms.harvard.edu,,"Roelofs, Jeroen/0000-0003-0944-2465","US National Institutes of Health (NIH) [GM043601, GM67945]; EMBO; NIH NRSA [5F32GM75737-2]","We thank J.

One such compound, phosphinothricin tripeptide, contains the unusual amino acid phosphinothricin attached to two alanine residues. Synthetic phosphinothricin (glufosinate) is a component of two top-selling herbicides (Basta and Liberty), and is widely used with resistant transgenic crops including corn, cotton and canola. Recent genetic and biochemical studies showed that during phosphinothricin tripeptide biosynthesis 2-hydroxyethylphosphonate (HEP) is converted to hydroxymethylphosphonate (HMP)(2). Here we report the in vitro reconstitution of this unprecedented C(sp(3))-C(sp(3)) bond cleavage reaction and X-ray crystal structures of the enzyme. The protein is a mononuclear non-haem iron(II)-dependent dioxygenase that converts HEP to HMP and formate. In contrast to most other members of this family, the oxidative consumption of HEP does not require additional cofactors or the input of exogenous electrons. The current study expands the scope of reactions catalysed by the 2-His-1-carboxylate mononuclear non-haem iron family of enzymes.","[Cicchillo, Robert M.; Zhang, Houjin; Whitteck, John T.; Nair, Satish K.; van der Donk, Wilfred A.; Metcalf, William W.] Univ Illinois, Inst Genom Biol, Urbana, IL 61802 USA; [Cicchillo, Robert M.; van der Donk, Wilfred A.] Univ Illinois, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Urbana, IL 61802 USA; [Zhang, Houjin; Nair, Satish K.; van der Donk, Wilfred A.] Univ Illinois, Dept Biochem, Urbana, IL 61802 USA; [Blodgett, Joshua A.

Here we report the genome sequences of six Candida species and compare these and related pathogens and non-pathogens. There are significant expansions of cell wall, secreted and transporter gene families in pathogenic species, suggesting adaptations associated with virulence. Large genomic tracts are homozygous in three diploid species, possibly resulting from recent recombination events. Surprisingly, key components of the mating and meiosis pathways are missing from several species. These include major differences at the mating-type loci (MTL); Lodderomyces elongisporus lacks MTL, and components of the alpha 1/alpha 2 cell identity determinant were lost in other species, raising questions about how mating and cell types are controlled. Analysis of the CUG leucine-to-serine genetic-code change reveals that 99% of ancestral CUG codons were erased and new ones arose elsewhere. Lastly, we revise the Candida albicans gene catalogue, identifying many new genes.","[Lin, Michael F.; Sakthikumar, Sharadha; Grabherr, Manfred; Kodira, Chinnappa; Zeng, Qiandong; Birren, Bruce W.; Kellis, Manolis; Cuomo, Christina A.] Broad Inst MIT & Harvard, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; [Butler, Geraldine; Fitzpatrick, David A.; Logue, Mary E.] Univ Coll Dublin, Conway Inst, UCD Sch Biomol & Biomed Sci, Dublin 4, Ireland; [Rasmussen, Matthew D.; Lin, Michael F.; Rheinbay, Esther; Kellis, Manolis] MIT, Comp Sci & Artificial Intelligence Lab, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Santos, Manuel A.

Current theory predicts that gamma oscillations are generated by synchronous activity of fast-spiking inhibitory interneurons, with the resulting rhythmic inhibition producing neural ensemble synchrony by generating a narrow window for effective excitation. We causally tested these hypotheses in barrel cortex in vivo by targeting optogenetic manipulation selectively to fast-spiking interneurons. Here we show that light-driven activation of fast-spiking interneurons at varied frequencies (8-200 Hz) selectively amplifies gamma oscillations. In contrast, pyramidal neuron activation amplifies only lower frequency oscillations, a cell-type-specific double dissociation. We found that the timing of a sensory input relative to a gamma cycle determined the amplitude and precision of evoked responses. Our data directly support the fast-spiking-gamma hypothesis and provide the first causal evidence that distinct network activity states can be induced in vivo by cell-type-specific activation.","[Cardin, Jessica A.; Knoblich, Ulf; Moore, Christopher I.] MIT, McGovern Inst Brain Res, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Cardin, Jessica A.] Univ Penn, Dept Neurosci, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Carlen, Marie; Meletis, Konstantinos; Tsai, Li-Huei] MIT, Picower Inst Learning & Memory, Dept Brain & Cognit Sci, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Carlen, Marie; Meletis, Konstantinos; Tsai, Li-Huei] Broad Inst Harvard & Massachusetts Inst Technol, Stanley Ctr Psychiat Res, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Zhang, Feng; Deisseroth, Karl] Stanford Univ, Dept Bioengn, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Tsai, Li-Huei] Howard Hughes Med Inst, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA","Moore, CI (reprint author), MIT, McGovern Inst Brain Res, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",deissero@stanford.edu; lhtsai@mit.edu; cim@mit.edu,"Moore, Christopher/C-5588-2009; Knoblich, Ulf/A-1762-2010","Knoblich, Ulf/0000-0002-0756-5587; Carlen, Marie/0000-0003-1658-1631; Moore, Christopher/0000-0003-4534-1602; Meletis, Konstantinos/0000-0001-5665-4781",NIH/NEI; Knut och Alice Wallenberg Foundation; NARSAD Young Investigator Award; NIH NRSA; Tom F.

Chaperones, or heat-shock proteins, are often implicated in buffering mutations, and could thus facilitate the acquisition of neutral genetic diversity and the rate of adaptation. We examined the ability of the Escherichia coli GroEL/GroES chaperonins to buffer destabilizing and adaptive mutations. Here we show that mutational drifts performed in vitro with four different enzymes indicated that GroEL/GroES overexpression doubled the number of accumulating mutations, and promoted the folding of enzyme variants carrying mutations in the protein core and/or mutations with higher destabilizing effects (destabilization energies of >3.5 kcal mol(-1), on average, versus, similar to 1 kcal mol(-1) in the absence of GroEL/GroES). The divergence of modified enzymatic specificity occurred much faster under GroEL/GroES overexpression, in terms of the number of adapted variants (>= 2-fold) and their improved specificity and activity (>= 10-fold). These results indicate that protein stability is a major constraint in protein evolution, and buffering mechanisms such as chaperonins are key in alleviating this constraint.","[Tokuriki, Nobuhiko; Tawfik, Dan S.] Weizmann Inst Sci, Dept Biol Chem, IL-76100 Rehovot, Israel","Tawfik, DS (reprint author), Weizmann Inst Sci, Dept Biol Chem, IL-76100 Rehovot, Israel.",tawfik@weizmann.ac.il,"TOKURIKI, NOBUHIKO/A-2968-2010",,NIH [W81XWH-07-2-0020]; Israel Science Foundation; EU,"Financial support by the EU via the MiFEM consortium, NIH grant number W81XWH-07-2-0020, and Israel Science Foundation are gratefully acknowledged.

Theory suggests that some with initial masses greater than 25 to 30 solar masses end up as Wolf-Rayet stars, which are deficient in hydrogen in their outer layers because of mass loss through strong stellar winds. The most massive of these stars have cores which may form a black hole and theory predicts that the resulting explosion of some of them produces ejecta of low kinetic energy, a faint optical luminosity and a small mass fraction of radioactive nickel(1-3). An alternative origin for low-energy supernovae is the collapse of the oxygen-neon core of a star of 7-9 solar masses(4,5). No weak, hydrogen-deficient, core-collapse supernovae have hitherto been seen. Here we report that SN 2008ha is a faint hydrogen-poor supernova. We propose that other similar events have been observed but have been misclassified as peculiar thermonuclear supernovae (sometimes labelled SN 2002cx-like events(6)). This discovery could link these faint supernovae to some long-duration gamma-ray bursts, because extremely faint, hydrogen-stripped core-collapse supernovae have been proposed to produce such long gamma-ray bursts, the afterglows of which do not show evidence of associated supernovae(7-9).","[Valenti, S.; Pastorello, A.; Smartt, S.

At present, cloud activity mainly occurs in the southern (summer) hemisphere, arising near the pole(5-12) and at mid-latitudes(7,8,13-15) from cumulus updrafts triggered by surface heating and/or local methane sources, and at the north (winter) pole(16,17), resulting from the subsidence and condensation of ethane-rich air into the colder troposphere. General circulation models(1-3) predict that this distribution should change with the seasons on a 15-year timescale, and that clouds should develop under certain circumstances at temperate latitudes (similar to 40 degrees) in the winter hemisphere(2). The models, however, have hitherto been poorly constrained and their long-term predictions have not yet been observationally verified. Here we report that the global spatial cloud coverage on Titan is in general agreement with the models, confirming that cloud activity is mainly controlled by the global circulation. The non-detection of clouds at latitude similar to 40 degrees N and the persistence of the southern clouds while the southern summer is ending are, however, both contrary to predictions. This suggests that Titan's equator-to-pole thermal contrast is overestimated in the models and that its atmosphere responds to the seasonal forcing with a greater inertia than expected.","[Rodriguez, Sebastien; Le Mouelic, Stephane; Tobie, Gabriel; Sotin, Christophe] Univ Nantes, CNRS, UMR 6112, Lab Planetol & Geodynam, F-44000 Nantes, France; [Rodriguez, Sebastien] Univ Paris 07, CNRS, CEA Saclay,DSM,IRFU,SAp, Lab AIM,UMR 7158, F-91191 Gif Sur Yvette, France; [Rannou, Pascal] Univ Reims, CNRS, Grp Spectrometrie Mol & Atmospher, UMR 6089, F-51687 Reims, France; [Rannou, Pascal] Univ Versailles St Quentin, CNRS, LATMOS, UMR 7620, F-91371 Verrieres Le Buisson, France; [Baines, Kevin H.; Pitman, Karly M.; Sotin, Christophe; Buratti, Bonnie J.] CALTECH, Jet Prop Lab, Pasadena, CA 91109 USA; [Barnes, Jason W.] NASA, Ames Res Ctr MS 244 30, Moffett Field, CA 94035 USA; [Griffith, Caitlin A.; Brown, Robert H.] Univ Arizona, Lunar & Planetary Lab, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA; [Hirtzig, Mathieu] Univ Michigan, PSL, AOSS, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Clark, Roger N.] US Geol Survey, Denver Fed Ctr, Denver, CO 80225 USA; [Nicholson, Phil D.] Cornell Univ, Dept Astron, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA","Rodriguez, S (reprint author), Univ Nantes, CNRS, UMR 6112, Lab Planetol & Geodynam, 2 Rue Houssiniere, F-44000 Nantes, France.",sebastien.rodriguez@cea.fr,"Barnes, Jason/B-1284-2009; RANNOU, Pascal/I-9059-2012; Rodriguez, Sebastien/H-5902-2016","Barnes, Jason/0000-0002-7755-3530; Rodriguez, Sebastien/0000-0003-1219-0641; Le Mouelic, Stephane/0000-0001-5260-1367",CNRS; CEA; CNES French; Universities of Paris Diderot and Nantes,"We thank M.

In the context of large complex systems, these features should lead to situations as envisaged in the 'Schrodinger's cat'(1) thought experiment (where the cat exists in a superposition of alive and dead states entangled with a radioactive nucleus). Such situations are not observed in nature. This may be simply due to our inability to sufficiently isolate the system of interest from the surrounding environment(2,3)- a technical limitation. Another possibility is some as-yet-undiscovered mechanism that prevents the formation of macroscopic entangled states(4). Such a limitation might depend on the number of elementary constituents in the system(5) or on the types of degrees of freedom that are entangled. Tests of the latter possibility have been made with photons, atoms and condensed matter devices(6,7). One system ubiquitous to nature where entanglement has not been previously demonstrated consists of distinct mechanical oscillators. Here we demonstrate deterministic entanglement of separated mechanical oscillators, consisting of the vibrational states of two pairs of atomic ions held in different locations. We also demonstrate entanglement of the internal states of an atomic ion with a distant mechanical oscillator. These results show quantum entanglement in a degree of freedom that pervades the classical world. Such experiments may lead to the generation of entangled states of larger-scale mechanical oscillators(8-10), and offer possibilities for testing non-locality with mesoscopic systems(11). In addition, the control developed here is an important ingredient for scaling-up quantum information processing with trapped atomic ions(12-14).","[Jost, J. D.; Home, J. P.; Amini, J.

For semiconductor nanocrystals, it was originally proposed(3) that these 'off' periods corresponded to a nanocrystal with an extra charge. A charged nanocrystal could have its photoluminescence temporarily quenched owing to the high efficiency of non-radiative ( for example, Auger) recombination processes between the extra charge and a subsequently excited electron-hole pair; photoluminescence would resume only after the nanocrystal becomes neutralized again. Despite over a decade of research, completely non-blinking nanocrystals(4,5) have not been synthesized and an understanding of the blinking phenomenon(6) remains elusive. Here we report ternary core/shell CdZnSe/ZnSe semiconductor nanocrystals that individually exhibit continuous, non-blinking photoluminescence. Unexpectedly, these nanocrystals strongly photoluminesce despite being charged, as indicated by a multi-peaked photoluminescence spectral shape and short lifetime. To model the unusual photoluminescence properties of the CdZnSe/ZnSe nanocrystals, we softened the abrupt confinement potential of a typical core/shell nanocrystal, suggesting that the structure is a radially graded alloy of CdZnSe into ZnSe. As photoluminescence blinking severely limits the usefulness of nanocrystals in applications requiring a continuous output of single photons, these non-blinking nanocrystals may enable substantial advances in fields ranging from single-molecule biological labelling(7) to low-threshold lasers(8).","[Wang, Xiaoyong; Hahn, Megan A.; Krauss, Todd D.] Univ Rochester, Dept Chem, Rochester, NY 14627 USA; [Krauss, Todd D.] Univ Rochester, Inst Opt, Rochester, NY 14627 USA; [Ren, Xiaofan; Kahen, Keith; Rajeswaran, Manju] Eastman Kodak Co, Rochester, NY 14650 USA; [Maccagnano-Zacher, Sara; Silcox, John] Cornell Univ, Sch Appl & Engn Phys, Ithaca, NY 14583 USA; [Cragg, George E.; Efros, Alexander L.] USN, Res Lab, Washington, DC 20375 USA","Krauss, TD (reprint author), Univ Rochester, Dept Chem, Rochester, NY 14627 USA.",keith.kahen@kodak.com; efros@dave.nrl.navy.mil; krauss@chem.rochester.edu,"Wang, Xiaoyong/D-5956-2012; Wang, Xiaoyong/F-9542-2012",,"DOE [DE-FC26-06NT42864]; NSF [CHE 0616378, CHE 0619418, EEC-0117770, DMR-9632275]; NYSTAR; University of Rochester Center for Electronic Imaging Systems; Cornell Center for Nanoscale Systems; Office of Naval Research; Alexander von Humboldt Foundation","We acknowledge financial support by the DOE (DE-FC26-06NT42864), NSF (CHE 0616378, CHE 0619418, EEC-0117770, DMR-9632275), NYSTAR, University of Rochester Center for Electronic Imaging Systems, the Cornell Center for Nanoscale Systems, the Office of Naval Research and the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation ( A.

Ice-sheet and climate modelling suggest reductions in atmospheric carbon dioxide ( less than three times the pre-industrial level of 280 parts per million by volume) that, in conjunction with the development of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current, led to cooling and glaciation paced by changes in Earth's orbit(2). Based on the present subglacial topography, numerical models point to ice-sheet genesis on mountain massifs of Antarctica, including the Gamburtsev mountains at Dome A, the centre of the present ice sheet(2,3). Our lack of knowledge of the present-day topography of the Gamburtsev mountains(4) means, however, that the nature of early glaciation and subsequent development of a continental-sized ice sheet are uncertain. Here we present radar information about the base of the ice at Dome A, revealing classic Alpine topography with pre-existing river valleys overdeepened by valley glaciers formed when the mean summer surface temperature was around 3 degrees C. This landscape is likely to have developed during the initial phases of Antarctic glaciation. According to Antarctic climate history (estimated from offshore sediment records) the Gamburtsev mountains are probably older than 34 million years and were the main centre for ice-sheet growth. Moreover, the landscape has most probably been preserved beneath the present ice sheet for around 14 million years.","[Bo, Sun; Cui Xiangbin; Jiang Yunyun; Tang Xueyuan; Li Yuansheng] Polar Res Inst China, Shanghai 200136, Peoples R China; [Siegert, Martin J.; Mudd, Simon M.; Sugden, David] Univ Edinburgh, Sch Geosci, Edinburgh EH9 3JW, Midlothian, Scotland; [Fujita, Shuji] Natl Inst Polar Res, Res Org Informat & Syst, Itabashi Ku, Tokyo 1738515, Japan","Bo, S (reprint author), Polar Res Inst China, 451 Jinqiao Rd, Shanghai 200136, Peoples R China.",sunbo@pric.gov.cn; m.j.siegert@ed.ac.uk,"Siegert, Martin/A-3826-2008; Mudd, Simon/F-8521-2010; Fujita, Shuji/A-7884-2016","Siegert, Martin/0000-0002-0090-4806; Mudd, Simon/0000-0002-1357-8501; Fujita, Shuji/0000-0003-0127-0777",National Natural Science Foundation of China [40476005]; Ministry of Science and Technology of China [2006BAB18B03]; UK Natural Environment Research Council [NE/D003733/1],"This paper is based upon work supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China ( 40476005), the International Polar Year programme CHINARE ( Ministry of Science and Technology of China 2006BAB18B03) and the UK Natural Environment Research Council (NE/D003733/1).

A consensus has developed that the mantle wedge overlying the subducting slab(3,4) and fluids and/or melts from the subducting slab itself(6-11) are involved in the melting process. However, the role of kinematic variables such as slab dip and convergence rate in the formation of arc magmas is still unclear. The depth to the top of the subducting slab beneath volcanic arcs, usually similar to 110 +/- 20 km, was previously thought to be constant among arcs(3,6,12). Recent studies(13,14) revealed that the depth of intermediate-depth earthquakes underneath volcanic arcs, presumably marking the slab wedge interface, varies systematically between similar to 60 and 173 km and correlates with slab dip and convergence rate. Water-rich magmas (over 4-6wt% H(2)O) are found in subduction zones with very different subduction parameters, including those with a shallow-dipping slab (north Japan), or steeply dipping slab (Marianas). Here we propose a simple model to address how kinematic parameters of plate subduction relate to the location of mantle melting at subduction zones. We demonstrate that the location of arc volcanoes is controlled by a combination of conditions: [GRAPHICS] melting in the wedge is induced at the overlap of regions in the wedge that are hotter than the melting curve (solidus) of vapour-saturated peridotite and regions where hydrous minerals both in the wedge and in the subducting slab break down. These two limits for melt generation, when combined with the kinematic parameters of slab dip and convergence rate, provide independent constraints on the thermal structure of the wedge and accurately predict the location of mantle wedge melting and the position of arc volcanoes.","[Grove, T.

In particular, interneurons defined by the fast-spiking phenotype and expression of the calcium-binding protein parvalbumin(1,2) have been suggested to be involved in gamma (30-80 Hz) oscillations(3-7), which are hypothesized to enhance information processing(8,9). However, because parvalbumin interneurons cannot be selectively controlled, definitive tests of their functional significance in gamma oscillations, and quantitative assessment of the impact of parvalbumin interneurons and gamma oscillations on cortical circuits, have been lacking despite potentially enormous significance (for example, abnormalities in parvalbumin interneurons may underlie altered gamma-frequency synchronization and cognition in schizophrenia(10) and autism(11)). Here we use a panel of optogenetic technologies(12-14) in mice to selectively modulate multiple distinct circuit elements in neocortex, alone or in combination. We find that inhibiting parvalbumin interneurons suppresses gamma oscillations in vivo, whereas driving these interneurons (even by means of non-rhythmic principal cell activity) is sufficient to generate emergent gamma-frequency rhythmicity. Moreover, gamma-frequency modulation of excitatory input in turn was found to enhance signal transmission in neocortex by reducing circuit noise and amplifying circuit signals, including inputs to parvalbumin interneurons. As demonstrated here, optogenetics opens the door to a new kind of informational analysis of brain function, permitting quantitative delineation of the functional significance of individual elements in the emergent operation and function of intact neural circuitry.","[Sohal, Vikaas S.; Zhang, Feng; Yizhar, Ofer; Deisseroth, Karl] Stanford Univ, Dept Psychiat & Behav Sci, Dept Bioengn, Stanford, CA 94305 USA","Deisseroth, K (reprint author), Stanford Univ, Dept Psychiat & Behav Sci, Dept Bioengn, W083 Clark Ctr,318 Campus Dr W, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",deissero@stanford.edu,"Sohal, Vikaas/M-9327-2016","Sohal, Vikaas/0000-0002-2238-4186; Yizhar, Ofer/0000-0003-4228-1448","President and Provost of Stanford University; BioX; Bioengineering; NIMH; NIDA; CIRM; NSF; Keck, McKnight and Coulter Foundations; NINDS","We thank S.

They form glutamate-gated ion channels that are highly permeable to calcium and mediate activity-dependent synaptic plasticity(1). NMDAR dysfunction is implicated in multiple brain disorders, including stroke, chronic pain and schizophrenia(2). NMDARs exist as multiple subtypes with distinct pharmacological and biophysical properties that are largely determined by the type of NR2 subunit (NR2A to NR2D) incorporated in the heteromeric NR1/NR2 complex(1,3,4). A fundamental difference between NMDAR subtypes is their channel maximal open probability (Po), which spans a 50-fold range from about 0.5 for NR2A-containing receptors to about 0.01 for receptors containing NR2C and NR2D; NR2B-containing receptors have an intermediate value (about 0.1)(5-9). These differences in Po confer unique charge transfer capacities and signalling properties on each receptor subtype(4,6,10,11). The molecular basis for this profound difference in activity between NMDAR subtypes is unknown. Here we show that the subunit-specific gating of NMDARs is controlled by the region formed by the NR2 amino-terminal domain (NTD), an extracellular clamshell-like domain previously shown to bind allosteric inhibitors(12-15), and the short linker connecting the NTD to the agonist-binding domain (ABD). The subtype specificity of NMDAR Po largely reflects differences in the spontaneous (ligand-independent) equilibrium between open-cleft and closed-cleft conformations of the NR2-NTD. This NTD-driven gating control also affects pharmacological properties by setting the sensitivity to the endogenous inhibitors zinc and protons. Our results provide a proof of concept for a drug-based bidirectional control of NMDAR activity by using molecules acting either as NR2-NTD 'closers' or 'openers' promoting receptor inhibition or potentiation, respectively.","[Gielen, Marc; Mony, Laetitia; Paoletti, Pierre] CNRS, Ecole Normale Super, Neurobiol Lab, F-75005 Paris, France; [Retchless, Beth Siegler; Johnson, Jon W.] Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Neurosci, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA","Paoletti, P (reprint author), CNRS, Ecole Normale Super, Neurobiol Lab, 46 Rue Ulm, F-75005 Paris, France.",paoletti@biologie.ens.fr,"Paoletti, Pierre/L-7358-2013; Mony, Laetitia/F-3790-2017","Paoletti, Pierre/0000-0002-3681-4845; Mony, Laetitia/0000-0001-7753-6231; Gielen, Marc/0000-0003-0941-4325",Ministere de la Recherche; Universite Pierre et Marie Curie (UPMC); Fondation pour la Recherche Medicale (FRM); NIH [R01 MH045817]; Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale (INSERM); Agence Nationale pour la Recherche (ANR); GlaxoSmith Kline; Equipe FRM,"We thank B.

The heart has little regenerative capacity after damage, leading to much interest in understanding the factors required to produce new cardiac myocytes. Despite a robust understanding of the molecular networks regulating cardiac differentiation(1,2), no single transcription factor or combination of factors has been shown to activate the cardiac gene program de novo in mammalian cells or tissues. Here we define the minimal requirements for transdifferentiation of mouse mesoderm to cardiac myocytes. We show that two cardiac transcription factors, Gata4 and Tbx5, and a cardiac-specific subunit of BAF chromatin-remodelling complexes, Baf60c (also called Smarcd3), can direct ectopic differentiation of mouse mesoderm into beating cardiomyocytes, including the normally non-cardiogenic posterior mesoderm and the extraembryonic mesoderm of the amnion. Gata4 with Baf60c initiated ectopic cardiac gene expression. Addition of Tbx5 allowed differentiation into contracting cardiomyocytes and repression of non-cardiac mesodermal genes. Baf60c was essential for the ectopic cardiogenic activity of Gata4 and Tbx5, partly by permitting binding of Gata4 to cardiac genes, indicating a novel instructive role for BAF complexes in tissues-specific regulation. The combined function of these factors establishes a robust mechanism for controlling cellular differentiation, and may allow reprogramming of new cardiomyocytes for regenerative purposes.","[Takeuchi, Jun K.; Bruneau, Benoit G.] Gladstone Inst Cardiovasc Dis, San Francisco, CA 94158 USA; [Takeuchi, Jun K.] Tokyo Inst Technol, Global Edge Inst, Div Cardiovasc Res, Midori Ku, Kanagawa 2268503, Japan; [Bruneau, Benoit G.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Pediat, Cardiovasc Res Inst, San Francisco, CA 94158 USA; [Bruneau, Benoit G.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Inst Regenerat Med, San Francisco, CA 94158 USA","Bruneau, BG (reprint author), Gladstone Inst Cardiovasc Dis, San Francisco, CA 94158 USA.",takeuchi.j.ab@m.titech.ac.jp; bbruneau@gladstone.ucsf.edu,,"Bruneau, Benoit/0000-0002-0804-7597","Human Frontiers Science Program CDA; MEXT's program for young independent researchers; Mitsubishi Foundation; Takeda Science Foundation; NHLBI [R01HL085860]; NIH/NCRR [C06 RR018928]; William H.

It has a pivotal role in regulation of the immune response and prevents excessive activation of NF-kappa B in response to a variety of external stimuli(2-7); recent genetic studies have disclosed putative associations of polymorphic A20 (also called TNFAIP3) alleles with autoimmune disease risk(8,9). However, the involvement of A20 in the development of human cancers is unknown. Here we show, using a genome-wide analysis of genetic lesions in 238 B-cell lymphomas, that A20 is a common genetic target in B-lineage lymphomas. A20 is frequently inactivated by somatic mutations and/or deletions in mucosa-associated tissue lymphoma (18 out of 87; 21.8%) and Hodgkin's lymphoma of ;nodular sclerosis histology (5 out of 15; 33.3%), and, to a lesser extent, in other B-lineage lymphomas. When re-expressed in a lymphoma-derived cell line with no functional A20 alleles, wildtype A20, but not mutant A20, resulted in suppression of cell growth and induction of apoptosis, accompanied by down-regulation of NF-kappa B activation. The A20-deficient cells stably generated tumours in immunodeficient mice, whereas the tumorigenicity was effectively suppressed by re-expression of A20. In A20-deficient cells, suppression of both cell growth and NF-kappa B activity due to re-expression of A20 depended, at least partly, on cell-surface-receptor signalling, including the tumour-necrosis factor receptor. Considering the physiological function of A20 in the negative modulation of NF-kappa B activation induced by multiple upstream stimuli, our findings indicate that uncontrolled signalling of NF-kappa B caused by loss of A20 function is involved in the pathogenesis of subsets of B-lineage lymphomas.","[Kato, Motohiro; Sanada, Masashi; Takita, Junko; Chen, Yuyan; Nakazaki, Kumi; Muto, Satsuki; Tamura, Azusa; Iio, Mitsuru; Ogawa, Seishi] Univ Tokyo, Canc Genom Project, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo 1138655, Japan; [Kato, Motohiro; Takita, Junko; Chen, Yuyan; Igarashi, Takashi] Univ Tokyo, Dept Pediat, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo 1138655, Japan; [Takita, Junko; Chiba, Shigeru] Univ Tokyo, Dept Cell Therapy & Transplantat Med, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo 1138655, Japan; [Nakazaki, Kumi; Kurokawa, Mineo] Univ Tokyo, Dept Hematol & Oncol, Grad Sch Med, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo 1138655, Japan; [Sanada, Masashi; Nakazaki, Kumi; Ogawa, Seishi] Japan Sci & Technol Agcy, Core Res Evolut Sci & Technol, Kawaguchi, Saitama 3320012, Japan; [Kato, Itaru; Niwa, Akira; Nakahata, Tatsutoshi] Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Med, Dept Pediat, Sakyo Ku, Kyoto 6068507, Japan; [Sato, Yasuharu; Yoshino, Tadashi] Okayama Univ, Grad Sch Med Dent & Pharmaceut Sci, Dept Pathol, Kita Ku, Okayama 7008558, Japan; [Takeuchi, Kengo; Ishikawa, Yuichi] Japanese Fdn Canc Res, Inst Canc, Div Pathol, Koto Ku, Tokyo 1358550, Japan; [Nomoto, Junko; Asakura, Yoshitaka; Tobinai, Kensei; Kobayashi, Yukio] Natl Canc Ctr, Div Hematol, Chuo Ku, Tokyo 1040045, Japan; [Okamoto, Koji; Nakagama, Hitoshi] Natl Canc Ctr, Early Oncogenesis Res Project, Res Inst, Chuo Ku, Tokyo 1040045, Japan; [Asakura, Yoshitaka] Aichi Canc Ctr, Res Inst, Div Immunol, Chikusa Ku, Nagoya, Aichi 4648681, Japan; [Hayashi, Yasuhide] Gunma Childrens Med Ctr, Shibukawa 3778577, Japan; [Mori, Hiraku] Showa Univ, Fujigaoka Hosp, Div Hematol, Aoba Ku, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2278501, Japan; [Mori, Shigeo] Teikyo Univ, Sch Med, Dept Pathol, Itabashi Ku, Tokyo 1738605, Japan","Ogawa, S (reprint author), Univ Tokyo, Canc Genom Project, Bunkyo Ku, 7-3-1 Hongo, Tokyo 1138655, Japan.",ykkobaya@ncc.go.jp; sogawa-tky@umin.ac.jp,"Kobayashi, Yukio/E-9081-2017","Kobayashi, Yukio/0000-0003-2378-7865; Kato, Motohiro/0000-0001-5145-1774; Takeuchi, Kengo/0000-0002-1599-5800","Core Research for Evolutional Science and Technology; Japan Science and Technology Agency; Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology of Japan; Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare of Japan","This work was supported by the Core Research for Evolutional Science and Technology, Japan Science and Technology Agency, by the 21 st century centre of excellence program 'Study on diseases caused by environment/genome interactions', and by Grant-in-Aids from the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology of Japan and from the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare of Japan for the 3rd- term Comprehensive 10-year Strategy for Cancer Control.

Gene expression profile studies have shown that its most aggressive subtype, ABC-DLBCL, is associated with constitutive activation of the NF-kappa B transcription complex(2). However, except for a small fraction of cases(3), it remains unclear whether NF-kappa B activation in these tumours represents an intrinsic program of the tumour cell of origin or a pathogenetic event. Here we show that >50% of ABC-DLBCL and a smaller fraction of GCB- DLBCL carry somatic mutations in multiple genes, including negative (TNFAIP3, also called A20) and positive (CARD11, TRAF2, TRAF5, MAP3K7 (TAK1) and TNFRSF11A ( RANK)) regulators of NF-kappa B. Of these, the A20 gene, which encodes a ubiquitin-modifying enzyme involved in termination of NF-kappa B responses, is most commonly affected, with similar to 30% of patients displaying biallelic inactivation by mutations and/or deletions. When reintroduced in cell lines carrying biallelic inactivation of the gene, A20 induced apoptosis and cell growth arrest, indicating a tumour suppressor role. Less frequently, missense mutations of TRAF2 and CARD11 produce molecules with significantly enhanced ability to activate NF-kappa B. Thus, our results demonstrate that NF-kappa B activation in DLBCL is caused by genetic lesions affecting multiple genes, the loss or activation of which may promote lymphomagenesis by leading to abnormally prolonged NF-kappa B responses.","[Compagno, Mara; Grunn, Adina; Nandula, Subhadra V.; Brahmachary, Manisha; Shen, Qiong; Califano, Andrea; Bhagat, Govind; Dalla-Favera, Riccardo; Pasqualucci, Laura] Columbia Univ, Inst Canc Genet, New York, NY 10032 USA; [Compagno, Mara; Grunn, Adina; Nandula, Subhadra V.; Brahmachary, Manisha; Shen, Qiong; Califano, Andrea; Bhagat, Govind; Dalla-Favera, Riccardo; Pasqualucci, Laura] Columbia Univ, Herbert Irving Comprehens Canc Ctr, New York, NY 10032 USA; [Lim, Wei Keat; Califano, Andrea] Columbia Univ, Joint Ctr Syst Biol, New York, NY 10032 USA; [Nandula, Subhadra V.; Bhagat, Govind; Dalla-Favera, Riccardo; Pasqualucci, Laura] Columbia Univ, Dept Pathol & Cell Biol, New York, NY 10032 USA; [Bertoni, Francesco; Scandurra, Marta] Oncol Inst So Switzerland IOSI, Expt Oncol Lab, CH-6500 Bellinzona, Switzerland; [Bertoni, Francesco; Scandurra, Marta] Oncol Inst So Switzerland IOSI, Lymphoma Unit, CH-6500 Bellinzona, Switzerland; [Ponzoni, Maurilio] Ist Sci San Raffaele, Unit Lymphoid Malignancies, Pathol Unit, I-20132 Milan, Italy; [Chadburn, Amy] Cornell Univ, Weill Med Coll, Dept Pathol & Lab Med, New York, NY 10021 USA; [Dalla-Favera, Riccardo] Columbia Univ, Dept Genet & Dev, New York, NY 10032 USA","Pasqualucci, L (reprint author), Columbia Univ, Inst Canc Genet, New York, NY 10032 USA.",lp171@columbia.edu,"Califano, Andrea/F-7239-2012","Bertoni, Francesco/0000-0001-5637-8983; Bhagat, Govind/0000-0001-6250-048X",NIH [P01 CA92625-07]; NIAID [R01AI066116]; National Centers for Biomedical Computing NIH Roadmap [U54CA121852]; Leukemia and Lymphoma Society SCOR,"We thank P.

Studies have shown that oncogene-induced senescence, which provides a barrier to tumour development, involves activation of the DDR(1-3). Using a genome-wide RNA interference (RNAi) screen, we have identified 17 factors required for oncogenic BRAF to induce senescence in primary fibroblasts and melanocytes(4). One of these factors is an F-box protein, FBXO31, a candidate tumour suppressor encoded in 16q24.3, a region in which there is loss of heterozygosity in breast, ovarian, hepatocellular and prostate cancers(5-9). Here we study the cellular role of FBXO31, identify its target substrate and determine the basis for its growth inhibitory activity. We show that ectopic expression of FBXO31 acts through a proteasome-directed pathway to mediate the degradation of cyclin D1, an important regulator of progression from G1 to S phase, resulting in arrest in G1. Cyclin D1 degradation results from a direct interaction with FBXO31 and is dependent on the F-box motif of FBXO31 and phosphorylation of cyclin D1 at Thr 286, which is known to be required for cyclin D1 proteolysis. The involvement of the DDR in oncogene-induced senescence prompted us to investigate the role of FBXO31 in DNA repair. We find that DNA damage induced by gamma-irradiation results in increased FBXO31 levels, which requires phosphorylation of FBXO31 by the DDR-initiating kinase ATM. RNAi-mediated knockdown of FBXO31 prevents cells from undergoing efficient arrest in G1 after gamma-irradiation and markedly increases sensitivity to DNA damage. Finally, we show that a variety of DNA damaging agents all result in a large increase in FBXO31 levels, indicating that induction of FBXO31 is a general response to genotoxic stress. Our results reveal FBXO31 as a regulator of the G1/S transition that is specifically required for DNA damage-induced growth arrest.","[Santra, Manas K.; Wajapeyee, Narendra; Green, Michael R.] Univ Massachusetts, Sch Med, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Program Gene Funct & Express, Worcester, MA 01605 USA; [Santra, Manas K.; Wajapeyee, Narendra; Green, Michael R.] Univ Massachusetts, Sch Med, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Program Mol Med, Worcester, MA 01605 USA","Green, MR (reprint author), Univ Massachusetts, Sch Med, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Program Gene Funct & Express, Worcester, MA 01605 USA.",michael.green@umassmed.edu,"Wajapeyee, Narendra/F-3011-2012",,Our Danny Cancer Fund; Howard Hughes Medical Institute,"We thank S.

They exhibit their toxic effect either by destruction of the membrane permeability barrier or by delivery of toxic components through the pores. Among the group of bacterial PFTs are some of the most dangerous toxins, such as diphtheria and anthrax toxin. Examples of eukaryotic PFTs are perforin and the membrane-attack complex, proteins of the immune system(2). PFTs can be subdivided into two classes, alpha-PFTs and beta-PFTs, depending on the suspected mode of membrane integration, either by alpha-helical or beta-sheet elements(3). The only high-resolution structure of a transmembrane PFT pore is available for a beta-PFT-alpha-haemolysin from Staphylococcus aureus 4. Cytolysin A (ClyA, also known as HlyE), an alpha-PFT, is a cytolytic alpha-helical toxin responsible for the haemolytic phenotype of several Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica strains(5-8). ClyA is cytotoxic towards cultured mammalian cells, induces apoptosis of macrophages and promotes tissue pervasion(9-11). Electron microscopic reconstructions demonstrated that the soluble monomer of ClyA(12) must undergo large conformational changes to form the transmembrane pore(13,14). Here we report the 3.3 angstrom crystal structure of the 400 kDa dodecameric transmembrane pore formed by ClyA. The tertiary structure of ClyA protomers in the pore is substantially different from that in the soluble monomer. The conversion involves more than half of all residues. It results in large rearrangements, up to 140 angstrom, of parts of the monomer, reorganization of the hydrophobic core, and transitions of beta-sheets and loop regions to alpha-helices. The large extent of interdependent conformational changes indicates a sequential mechanism for membrane insertion and pore formation.","[Mueller, Marcus; Grauschopf, Ulla; Maier, Timm; Glockshuber, Rudi; Ban, Nenad] ETH, Inst Mol Biol & Biophys, CH-8093 Zurich, Switzerland","Ban, N (reprint author), ETH, Inst Mol Biol & Biophys, CH-8093 Zurich, Switzerland.",ban@mol.biol.ethz.ch,"Maier, Timm/A-8835-2016","Maier, Timm/0000-0002-7459-1363",Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF); National Center of Excellence in Research (NCCR); Structural Biology program of the SNSF,"We thank B.

However, co-evolution of enzymes for metabolic diversification is not well understood, especially at the biochemical level. Here, two parallel assemblies with an extraordinarily high sequence identity from Lyngbya majuscula forma beta-branched cyclopropane in the curacin A pathway (Cur), and a vinyl chloride group in the jamaicamide pathway (Jam). The components include a halogenase, a 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl enzyme cassette for polyketide beta-branching, and an enoyl reductase domain. The halogenase from CurA, and the dehydratases (ECH(1)s), decarboxylases (ECH(2)s) and enoyl reductase domains from both Cur and Jam, were assessed biochemically to determine the mechanisms of cyclopropane and vinyl chloride formation. Unexpectedly, the polyketide beta-branching pathway was modified by introduction of a gamma-chlorination step on (S)-3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl mediated by Cur halogenase, a non-haem Fe(II), alpha-ketoglutarate-dependent enzyme(2). In a divergent scheme, Cur ECH(2) was found to catalyse formation of the alpha,beta enoyl thioester, whereas Jam ECH(2) formed a vinyl chloride moiety by selectively generating the corresponding beta, gamma enoyl thioester of the 3-methyl-4-chloroglutaconyl decarboxylation product. Finally, the enoyl reductase domain of CurF specifically catalysed an unprecedented cyclopropanation on the chlorinated product of Cur ECH(2) instead of the canonical alpha,beta C=C saturation reaction. Thus, the combination of chlorination and polyketide beta-branching, coupled with mechanistic diversification of ECH(2) and enoyl reductase, leads to the formation of cyclopropane and vinyl chloride moieties. These results reveal a parallel interplay of evolutionary events in multienzyme systems leading to functional group diversity in secondary metabolites.","[Gu, Liangcai; Geders, Todd W.; Smith, Janet L.; Sherman, David H.] Univ Michigan, Inst Life Sci, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Gu, Liangcai; Sherman, David H.] Univ Michigan, Dept Med Chem, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Wang, Bo; Hakansson, Kristina; Sherman, David H.] Univ Michigan, Dept Chem, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Smith, Janet L.] Univ Michigan, Dept Biol Chem, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Sherman, David H.] Univ Michigan, Dept Microbiol & Immunol, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Kulkarni, Amol; Wipf, Peter] Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Chem, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA; [Kulkarni, Amol; Wipf, Peter] Univ Pittsburgh, Ctr Chem Methodol & Lib Dev, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA; [Grindberg, Rashel V.; Gerwick, Lena; Gerwick, William H.] Univ Calif San Diego, Scripps Inst Oceanog, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Grindberg, Rashel V.; Gerwick, Lena; Gerwick, William H.] Univ Calif San Diego, Skaggs Sch Pharm & Pharmaceut Sci, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA","Sherman, DH (reprint author), Univ Michigan, Inst Life Sci, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",davidhs@umich.edu,"Gu, Liangcai/E-4600-2010; Hakansson, Kristina/G-9428-2016","Hakansson, Kristina/0000-0003-1926-0542",National Institutes of Health; Eli Lilly Co.; Rackham Predoctoral Fellowship,"We thank C.

It has a relatively high reproduction rate for a primate, making it potentially suitable for transgenic modification. Although several attempts have been made to produce non-human transgenic primates, transgene expression in the somatic tissues of live infants has not been demonstrated by objective analyses such as polymerase chain reaction with reverse transcription or western blots. Here we show that the injection of a self-inactivating lentiviral vector in sucrose solution into marmoset embryos results in transgenic common marmosets that expressed the transgene in several organs. Notably, we achieved germline transmission of the transgene, and the transgenic offspring developed normally. The successful creation of transgenic marmosets provides a new animal model for human disease that has the great advantage of a close genetic relationship with humans. This model will be valuable to many fields of biomedical research.","[Sasaki, Erika; Suemizu, Hiroshi; Shimada, Akiko; Oiwa, Ryo; Kamioka, Michiko; Tomioka, Ikuo; Hirakawa, Reiko; Eto, Tomoo; Shiozawa, Seiji; Maeda, Takuji; Ito, Mamoru; Ito, Ryoji; Kito, Chika; Yagihashi, Chie; Kawai, Kenji; Tanioka, Yoshikuni; Tamaoki, Norikazu; Nomura, Tatsuji] Cent Inst Expt Anim, Miyamae Ku, Kanagawa 2160001, Japan; [Hanazawa, Kisaburo] Juntendo Univ, Nerima Hosp, Dept Urol, Nerima Ku, Tokyo 1778521, Japan; [Tomioka, Ikuo; Hirakawa, Reiko] Keio Univ, Sch Med, Ctr Integrated Med Res, Shinjuku Ku, Tokyo 1608582, Japan; [Shiozawa, Seiji; Maeda, Takuji; Okano, Hideyuki] Keio Univ, Sch Med, Dept Physiol, Shinjuku Ku, Tokyo 1608582, Japan; [Sotomaru, Yusuke] Hiroshima Univ, Nat Sci Ctr Basic Res & Dev, Minami Ku, Hiroshima 7348551, Japan; [Miyoshi, Hiroyuki] RIKEN, BioResource Ctr, Subteam Manipulat Cell Fate, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3050074, Japan; [Habu, Sonoko] Tokai Univ, Sch Med, Dept Immunol, Kanagawa 2591193, Japan","Sasaki, E (reprint author), Cent Inst Expt Anim, Miyamae Ku, 1430 Nogawa, Kanagawa 2160001, Japan.",esasaki@ciea.or.jp; hidokano@sc.itc.keio.ac.jp,"Miyoshi, Hiroyuki/G-9808-2013; Shiozawa, Seiji/L-1248-2013; Hidokano, Hideyuki/J-5973-2013",,"Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT); Japanese Government to Keio University; Solution-Oriented Research for Science and Technology (SORST) of the Japan Science and Technology Agency","We thank F.

To identify common genetic risk factors underlying ASDs, here we present the results of genome-wide association studies on a cohort of 780 families (3,101 subjects) with affected children, and a second cohort of 1,204 affected subjects and 6,491 control subjects, all of whom were of European ancestry. Six single nucleotide polymorphisms between cadherin 10 (CDH10) and cadherin 9 (CDH9)-two genes encoding neuronal cell-adhesion molecules-revealed strong association signals, with the most significant SNP being rs4307059 (P = 3.4 x 10(-8), odds ratio = 1.19). These signals were replicated in two independent cohorts, with combined P values ranging from 7.4 x 10(-8) to 2.1 x 10(-10).

These oscillations are prominent in the local field potential, and they also reflect the subthreshold membrane potential and strongly modulate the spiking of hippocampal neurons. The prevailing view is that theta oscillations are synchronized throughout the hippocampus, despite the lack of conclusive experimental evidence. In contrast, here we show that in freely behaving rats, theta oscillations in area CA1 are travelling waves that propagate roughly along the septotemporal axis of the hippocampus. Furthermore, we find that spiking in the CA1 pyramidal cell layer is modulated in a consistent travelling wave pattern. Our results demonstrate that theta oscillations pattern hippocampal activity not only in time, but also across anatomical space. The presence of travelling waves indicates that the instantaneous output of the hippocampus is topographically organized and represents a segment, rather than a point, of physical space.","[Lubenov, Evgueniy V.; Siapas, Athanassios G.] CALTECH, Div Engn & Appl Sci, Div Biol, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA","Siapas, AG (reprint author), CALTECH, Div Engn & Appl Sci, Div Biol, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA.",lubenov@caltech.edu; thanos@caltech.edu,,,Caltech Information Science and Technology Center for Biological Circuit Design; 21st Century McDonnell Foundation Award; Bren Foundation; McKnight Foundation,"We thank C.

The iron K line is prominent in the reflection spectrum(5,6) created by the hard-X-ray continuum irradiating dense accreting matter. Relativistic distortion(7) of the line makes it sensitive to the strong gravity and spin of the black hole(8). The accompanying iron L-line emission should be detectable when the iron abundance is high. Here we report the presence of both iron K and iron L emission in the spectrum of the narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxy(9) 1H 0707-495. The bright iron L emission has enabled us to detect a reverberation lag of about 30 s between the direct X-ray continuum and its reflection from matter falling into the black hole. The observed reverberation timescale is comparable to the light-crossing time of the innermost radii around a supermassive black hole. The combination of spectral and timing data on 1H 0707-495 provides strong evidence that we are witnessing emission from matter within a gravitational radius, or a fraction of a light minute, from the event horizon of a rapidly spinning, massive black hole.","[Fabian, A.

They are expected to be tidally locked, which can lead to a large temperature difference between their daysides and nightsides. Infrared observations of eclipsing systems have yielded dayside temperatures for a number of transiting planets(1-5). The day-night contrast of the transiting extrasolar planet HD189733b was 'mapped' using infrared observations(6,7). It is expected that the contrast between the daysides and nightsides of hot Jupiters is much higher at visual wavelengths, shorter than that of the peak emission, and could be further enhanced by reflected stellar light. Here we report the analysis of optical photometric data(8) obtained over 36 planetary orbits of the transiting hot Jupiter CoRoT-1b. The data are consistent with the nightside hemisphere of the planet being entirely black, with the dayside flux dominating the optical phase curve. This means that at optical wavelengths the planet's phase variation is just as we see it for the interior planets in the Solar System. The data allow for only a small fraction of reflected light, corresponding to a geometric albedo of <0.20.","[Snellen, Ignas A. G.; de Mooij, Ernst J.

It allows a quantum system to be 'in two places at the same time', because the quantum state of a physical system can simultaneously include measurably different physical states. The preparation and use of such superposed states forms the basis of quantum computation and simulation(1). The creation of complex superpositions in harmonic systems (such as the motional state of trapped ions(2), microwave resonators(3-5) or optical cavities(6)) has presented a significant challenge because it cannot be achieved with classical control signals. Here we demonstrate the preparation and measurement of arbitrary quantum states in an electromagnetic resonator, superposing states with different numbers of photons in a completely controlled and deterministic manner. We synthesize the states using a superconducting phase qubit to phase-coherently pump photons into the resonator, making use of an algorithm(7) that generalizes a previously demonstrated method of generating photon number (Fock) states in a resonator(8). We completely characterize the resonator quantum state using Wigner tomography, which is equivalent to measuring the resonator's full density matrix.","[Hofheinz, Max; Wang, H.; Ansmann, M.; Bialczak, Radoslaw C.; Lucero, Erik; Neeley, M.; O'Connell, A.

Back-action cooling, for example, is being pursued as a means of achieving the quantum ground state of macroscopic mechanical oscillators. Work in the optical domain has revolved around millimetre-or micrometre-scale structures using the radiation pressure force. By comparison, in microwave devices, low-loss superconducting structures have been used for gradient-force-mediated coupling to a nanomechanical oscillator of picogram mass(7). Here we describe measurements of an optical system consisting of a pair of specially patterned nanoscale beams in which optical and mechanical energies are simultaneously localized to a cubic-micron-scale volume, and for which large perphoton optical gradient forces are realized. The resulting scale of the per-photon force and the mass of the structure enable the exploration of cavity optomechanical regimes in which, for example, the mechanical rigidity of the structure is dominantly provided by the internal light field itself. In addition to precision measurement and sensitive force detection(9), nano-optomechanics may find application in reconfigurable and tunable photonic systems(10), light-based radio-frequency communication(11) and the generation of giant optical nonlinearities for wavelength conversion and optical buffering(12).","[Eichenfield, Matt; Camacho, Ryan; Chan, Jasper; Vahala, Kerry J.; Painter, Oskar] CALTECH, Sr Lab Appl Phys, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA","Painter, O (reprint author), CALTECH, Sr Lab Appl Phys, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA.",opainter@caltech.edu,"Camacho, Ryan/B-1841-2010; Chan, Jasper/E-6801-2011","Camacho, Ryan/0000-0001-9644-1422; Painter, Oskar/0000-0002-1581-9209",US Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency; US National Science Foundation,"The authors would like to thank Q.

Permafrost thaw and the microbial decomposition of previously frozen organic carbon is considered one of the most likely positive climate feedbacks from terrestrial ecosystems to the atmosphere in a warmer world(1,2,4-7). The rate of carbon release from permafrost soils is highly uncertain, but it is crucial for predicting the strength and timing of this carbon-cycle feedback effect, and thus how important permafrost thaw will be for climate change this century and beyond(1,2,4-7). Sustained transfers of carbon to the atmosphere that could cause a significant positive feedback to climate change must come from old carbon, which forms the bulk of the permafrost carbon pool that accumulated over thousands of years(8-11). Here we measure net ecosystem carbon exchange and the radiocarbon age of ecosystem respiration in a tundra landscape undergoing permafrost thaw(12) to determine the influence of old carbon loss on ecosystem carbon balance. We find that areas that thawed over the past 15 years had 40 per cent more annual losses of old carbon than minimally thawed areas, but had overall net ecosystem carbon uptake as increased plant growth offset these losses. In contrast, areas that thawed decades earlier lost even more old carbon, a 78 per cent increase over minimally thawed areas; this old carbon loss contributed to overall net ecosystem carbon release despite increased plant growth. Our data document significant losses of soil carbon with permafrost thaw that, over decadal timescales, overwhelms increased plant carbon uptake(13-15) at rates that could make permafrost a large biospheric carbon source in a warmer world.","[Schuur, Edward A.

A large and mostly undegassed mantle reservoir is also required to balance the Earth's (40)Ar budget, because only half of the (40)Ar produced from the radioactive decay of 40 K is accounted for by the atmosphere and upper mantle(5). However, geophysical(6,7) and geochemical observations(8) suggest slab subduction into the lower mantle, implying that most or all of Earth's mantle should have been processed by partial melting beneath mid-ocean ridges and hotspot volcanoes. This should have left noble gases in both the upper and the lower mantle extensively outgassed, contrary to expectations from (3)He/(4)He ratios and the Earth's (40)Ar budget. Here we suggest a simple solution: recycling and mixing of noble-gas-depleted slabs dilutes the concentrations of noble gases in the mantle, thereby decreasing the rate of mantle degassing and leaving significant amounts of noble gases in the processed mantle. As a result, even when the mass flux across the 660-km seismic discontinuity is equivalent to approximately one lower-mantlemass over the Earth's history, high (3)He contents, high (3)He/(4)He ratios and (40)Ar concentrations high enough to satisfy the (40)Ar mass balance of the Earth can be preserved in the lower mantle. The differences in (3)He/(4)He ratios between mid-ocean-ridge basalts and ocean island basalts, as well as high concentrations of (3)He and (40)Ar in the mantle source of ocean island basalts(4), can be explained within the framework of different processing rates for the upper and the lower mantle. Hence, to preserve primitive noble gas signatures, we find no need for hidden reservoirs or convective isolation of the lower mantle for any length of time.","[Gonnermann, Helge M.] Rice Univ, Dept Earth Sci, Houston, TX 77005 USA; [Mukhopadhyay, Sujoy] Harvard Univ, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA","Gonnermann, HM (reprint author), Rice Univ, Dept Earth Sci, Houston, TX 77005 USA.",helge@rice.edu; sujoy@eps.harvard.edu,"Gonnermann, Helge/B-1054-2012",,University of Hawaii; SOEST Young Investigator programme; US National Science Foundation [EAR 0509721],"We thank R.

However, cultural diversity has species-typical constraints(1), presumably of genetic origin. A celebrated, if contentious, example is whether a universal grammar constrains syntactic diversity in human languages(2). Oscine songbirds exhibit song learning and provide biologically tractable models of culture: members of a species show individual variation in song(3) and geographically separated groups have local song dialects(4,5). Different species exhibit distinct song cultures(6,7), suggestive of genetic constraints(8,9). Without such constraints, innovations and copying errors should cause unbounded variation over multiple generations or geographical distance, contrary to observations(9). Here we report an experiment designed to determine whether wild-type song culture might emerge over multiple generations in an isolated colony founded by isolates, and, if so, how this might happen and what type of social environment is required(10). Zebra finch isolates, unexposed to singing males during development, produce song with characteristics that differ from the wild-type song found in laboratory(11) or natural colonies. In tutoring lineages starting from isolate founders, we quantified alterations in song across tutoring generations in two social environments: tutor-pupil pairs in sound-isolated chambers and an isolated semi-natural colony. In both settings, juveniles imitated the isolate tutors but changed certain characteristics of the songs. These alterations accumulated over learning generations. Consequently, songs evolved towards the wild-type in three to four generations. Thus, species-typical song culture can appear de novo. Our study has parallels with language change and evolution(12-14). In analogy to models in quantitative genetics(15,16), we model song culture as a multigenerational phenotype partly encoded genetically in an isolate founding population, influenced by environmental variables and taking multiple generations to emerge.","[Feher, Olga; Saar, Sigal; Tchernichovski, Ofer] CUNY City Coll, Dept Biol, New York, NY 10031 USA; [Wang, Haibin; Mitra, Partha P.] Cold Spring Harbor Lab, Cold Spring Harbor, NY 11724 USA","Feher, O (reprint author), CUNY City Coll, Dept Biol, 138Th St & Convent Ave, New York, NY 10031 USA.",olcifeher@gmail.com,,"Tchernichovski, Ofer/0000-0001-6788-614X",US National Institutes of Health (NIH); NIH Research Centers in Minority Institutions; Crick-Clay Professorship,"We thank J.

Previous studies focusing on candidate genes or genomic regions have identified several copy number variations (CNVs) that are associated with an increased risk of ASDs(5-9). Here we present the results from a whole-genome CNV study on a cohort of 859 ASD cases and 1,409 healthy children of European ancestry who were genotyped with similar to 550,000 single nucleotide polymorphism markers, in an attempt to comprehensively identify CNVs conferring susceptibility to ASDs. Positive findings were evaluated in an independent cohort of 1,336 ASD cases and 1,110 controls of European ancestry. Besides previously reported ASD candidate genes, such as NRXN1 (ref. 10) and CNTN4 (refs 11, 12), several new susceptibility genes encoding neuronal cell-adhesion molecules, including NLGN1 and ASTN2, were enriched with CNVs in ASD cases compared to controls (P = 9.5 x 10(-3)). Furthermore, CNVs within or surrounding genes involved in the ubiquitin pathways, including UBE3A, PARK2, RFWD2 and FBXO40, were affected by CNVs not observed in controls (P = 3.3 x 10(-3)). We also identified duplications 55 kilobases upstream of complementary DNA AK123120 (P = 3.6 x 10(-6)). Although these variants may be individually rare, they target genes involved in neuronal cell-adhesion or ubiquitin degradation, indicating that these two important gene networks expressed within the central nervous system may contribute to the genetic susceptibility of ASD.","[Glessner, Joseph T.; Wang, Kai; Kim, Cecilia E.; Zhang, Haitao; Bradfield, Jonathan P.; Imielinski, Marcin; Frackelton, Edward C.; Sleiman, Patrick M.

They make use of seven-transmembrane G-protein-coupled receptors to identify odorants and pheromones. These receptors are present on dendrites of olfactory sensory neurons located in the main olfactory or vomeronasal sensory epithelia, and pertain to the odorant(2), trace amine-associated receptor(3) and vomeronasal type 1 (ref. 4) or 2 (refs 5-7) receptor superfamilies. Whether these four sensor classes represent the complete olfactory molecular repertoire used by mammals to make sense of the outside world is unknown. Here we report the expression of formyl peptide receptor-related genes by vomeronasal sensory neurons, in multiple mammalian species. Similar to the four known olfactory receptor gene classes, these genes encode seven-transmembrane proteins, and are characterized by monogenic transcription and a punctate expression pattern in the sensory neuroepithelium. In vitro expression of mouse formyl peptide receptor-like 1, 3, 4, 6 and 7 provides sensitivity to disease/inflammation-related ligands. Establishing an in situ approach that combines whole-mount vomeronasal preparations with dendritic calcium imaging in the intact neuroepithelium, we show neuronal responses to the same molecules, which therefore represent a new class of vomeronasal agonists. Taken together, these results suggest that formyl peptide receptor-like proteins have an olfactory function associated with the identification of pathogens, or of pathogenic states.","[Riviere, Stephane; Challet, Ludivine; Rodriguez, Ivan] Univ Geneva, Dept Zool & Anim Biol, CH-1205 Geneva, Switzerland; [Riviere, Stephane; Challet, Ludivine; Rodriguez, Ivan] Univ Geneva, Natl Ctr Competence Frontiers Genet, CH-1205 Geneva, Switzerland; [Fluegge, Daniela; Spehr, Marc] Ruhr Univ Bochum, Dept Cellular Physiol, D-44780 Bochum, Germany","Rodriguez, I (reprint author), Univ Geneva, Dept Zool & Anim Biol, CH-1205 Geneva, Switzerland.",ivan.rodriguez@unige.ch,"Spehr, Marc/B-3140-2011; Marion-Poll, Frederic/D-8882-2011","Spehr, Marc/0000-0001-6616-4196; Marion-Poll, Frederic/0000-0001-6824-0180","Swiss National Science Foundation; Claraz, Schmidheiny; Volkswagen; Schlumberger Foundations; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft","We thank C.-D.

Nevertheless, many pathogenic bacteria, including Shigella, are able to surmount exfoliation and colonize the epithelium efficiently(3,4). Here we show that the Shigella flexneri effector OspE(5,6) (consisting of OspE1 and OspE2 proteins), which is highly conserved among enteropathogenic Escherichia coli, enterohaemorrhagic E. coli, Citrobacter rodentium and Salmonella strains(7), reinforces host cell adherence to the basement membrane by interacting with integrin-linked kinase (ILK)(8). The number of focal adhesions was augmented along with membrane fraction ILK by ILK-OspE binding. The interaction between ILK and OspE increased cell surface levels of beta 1 integrin and suppressed phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase and paxillin, which are required for rapid turnover of focal adhesion in cell motility(9). Nocodazole-washout-induced focal adhesion disassembly was blocked by expression of OspE. Polarized epithelial cells infected with a Shigella mutant lacking the ospE gene underwent more rapid cell detachment than cells infected with wild-type Shigella. Infection of guinea pig colons with Shigella corroborated the pivotal role of the OspE-ILK interaction in suppressing epithelial detachment, increasing bacterial cell-to-cell spreading, and promoting bacterial colonization. These results indicate that Shigella sustain their infectious foothold by using special tactics to prevent detachment of infected cells.","[Kim, Minsoo; Sasakawa, Chihiro] Univ Tokyo, Int Res Ctr Infect Dis, Dept Infect Dis Control, Minato Ku, Tokyo 1088639, Japan; [Ogawa, Michinaga; Fujita, Yukihiro; Yoshikawa, Yuko; Nagai, Takeshi; Sasakawa, Chihiro] Univ Tokyo, Inst Med Sci, Dept Microbiol & Immunol, Minato Ku, Tokyo 1088639, Japan; [Kim, Minsoo; Ogawa, Michinaga; Fujita, Yukihiro; Yoshikawa, Yuko; Nagai, Takeshi; Sasakawa, Chihiro] Japan Sci & Technol Agcy, CREST, Kawaguchi, Saitama 3320012, Japan; [Koyama, Tomohiro; Nagai, Shinya] Nippon Inst Biol Sci, Tokyo 1980024, Japan; [Lange, Anika; Faessler, Reinhard] Max Planck Inst Biochem, Dept Mol Med, D-82151 Martinsried, Germany","Sasakawa, C (reprint author), Univ Tokyo, Int Res Ctr Infect Dis, Dept Infect Dis Control, Minato Ku, 4-6-1 Shirokanedai, Tokyo 1088639, Japan.",sasakawa@ims.u-tokyo.ac.jp,,"Kim, Minsoo/0000-0001-8536-8653","Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft [SFB576]; Max Planck Society; Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology of Japan (MEXT); Japan Science and Technology Agency (JSTA)","We thank S.

For example, steroid hormones accumulate in specific cell types of the animal fetus to induce sexual differentiation(1) and concentration peaks of the plant hormone auxin direct organ initiation and mediate tissue patterning(2-4). Here we provide an example of a regulated local hormone minimum required during organogenesis. Our results demonstrate that formation of a local auxin minimum is necessary for specification of the valve margin separation layer where Arabidopsis fruit opening takes place. Consequently, ectopic production of auxin, specifically in valve margin cells, leads to a complete loss of proper cell fate determination. The valve margin identity factor INDEHISCENT (IND) is responsible for forming the auxin minimum by coordinating auxin efflux in separation-layer cells. We propose that the simplicity of formation and maintenance make local hormone minima particularly well suited to specify a small number of cells such as the stripes at the valve margins.","[Sorefan, Karim; Girin, Thomas; Ostergaard, Lars] John Innes Ctr Plant Sci Res, Crop Genet Dept, Norwich NR4 7UH, Norfolk, England; [Liljegren, Sarah J.; Robles, Pedro; Yanofsky, Martin F.] Univ Calif San Diego, Sect Cell & Dev Biol, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Liljegren, Sarah J.] Univ N Carolina, Dept Biol, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA; [Ljung, Karin] Umea Plant Sci Ctr, Dept Forest Genet & Plant Physiol, S-90183 Umea, Sweden; [Robles, Pedro] Univ Miguel Hernandez, Div Genet, Alicante 03202, Spain; [Robles, Pedro] Univ Miguel Hernandez, Inst Bioingn, Alicante 03202, Spain; [Galvan-Ampudia, Carlos S.; Offringa, Remko] Leiden State Univ, Inst Biol, Dept Mol & Dev Genet, NL-2333 AL Leiden, Netherlands; [Friml, Jiri] Univ Ghent VIB, Dept Plant Syst Biol, VIB, B-9052 Ghent, Belgium; [Friml, Jiri] Univ Ghent VIB, Dept Plant Biotechnol & Genet, B-9052 Ghent, Belgium","Ostergaard, L (reprint author), John Innes Ctr Plant Sci Res, Crop Genet Dept, Norwich Res Pk,Colney Lane, Norwich NR4 7UH, Norfolk, England.",lars.ostergaard@bbsrc.ac.uk,"Friml, Jiri/D-9511-2012",,Spanish government; FWO; Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research; National Science Foundation; Biotechnological and Biological Sciences Research Council; John Innes Centre,"We thank E.

To deal with radiation-induced damage, cells mount complex responses that rely on changes in gene expression. These gene expression responses differ greatly between individuals(1) and contribute to individual differences in response to radiation(2). Here we identify regulators that influence expression levels of radiation-responsive genes. We treated radiation-induced changes in gene expression as quantitative phenotypes(3,4), and conducted genetic linkage and association studies to map their regulators. For more than 1,200 of these phenotypes there was significant evidence of linkage to specific chromosomal regions. Nearly all of the regulators act in trans to influence the expression of their target genes; there are very few cis-acting regulators. Some of the transacting regulators are transcription factors, but others are genes that were not known to have a regulatory function in radiation response. These results have implications for our basic and clinical understanding of how human cells respond to radiation.","[Smirnov, Denis A.; Cheung, Vivian G.] Univ Penn, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Morley, Michael; Shin, Eunice; Cheung, Vivian G.] Univ Penn, Childrens Hosp Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Spielman, Richard S.; Cheung, Vivian G.] Univ Penn, Dept Genet, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Cheung, Vivian G.] Univ Penn, Dept Pediat, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA","Cheung, VG (reprint author), Univ Penn, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",vcheung@mail.med.upenn.edu,,,National Center for Research Resources; National Institutes of Health; University of Pennsylvania Center for Excellence in Environmental Toxicology; W.

The unidirectionality of cell-cycle transitions is fundamental for the successful completion of this cycle. It is thought that irrevocable proteolytic degradation of key cell-cycle regulators makes cell-cycle transitions irreversible, thereby enforcing directionality(1-3). Here we have experimentally examined the contribution of cyclin proteolysis to the irreversibility of mitotic exit, the transition from high mitotic Cdk activity back to low activity in G1. We show that forced cyclin destruction in mitotic budding yeast cells efficiently drives mitotic exit events. However, these remain reversible after termination of cyclin proteolysis, with recovery of the mitotic state and cyclin levels. Mitotic exit becomes irreversible only after longer periods of cyclin degradation, owing to activation of a double-negative feedback loop involving the Cdk inhibitor Sic1 (refs 4, 5). Quantitative modelling suggests that feedback is required to maintain low Cdk activity and to prevent cyclin resynthesis. Our findings demonstrate that the unidirectionality of mitotic exit is not the consequence of proteolysis but of systems-level feedback required to maintain the cell cycle in a new stable state.","[Lopez-Aviles, Sandra; Uhlmann, Frank] Canc Res UK London Res Inst, Chromosome Segregat Lab, London WC2A 3PX, England; [Kapuy, Orsolya; Novak, Bela] Univ Oxford, Dept Biochem, Oxford Ctr Integrat Syst Biol, Oxford OX1 3QU, England; [Kapuy, Orsolya] Budapest Univ Technol & Econ, H-1521 Budapest, Hungary","Uhlmann, F (reprint author), Canc Res UK London Res Inst, Chromosome Segregat Lab, 44 Lincolns Inn Fields, London WC2A 3PX, England.",frank.uhlmann@cancer.org.uk,"Novak, Bela/D-5365-2009","Novak, Bela/0000-0002-6961-1366",European Commission Marie Curie Individual Fellowship; BBSRC; EC FP7,"We thank C.

InsP(3) and cyclic ADP ribose cause the release of Ca(2+) from sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum stores by the activation of InsP(3) and ryanodine receptors (InsP(3)Rs and RyRs). In contrast, the nature of the intracellular stores targeted by NAADP and the molecular identity of the NAADP receptors remain controversial(1,2), although evidence indicates that NAADP mobilizes Ca(2+) from lysosome-related acidic compartments(3,4). Here we show that two-pore channels (TPCs) comprise a family of NAADP receptors, with human TPC1 (also known as TPCN1) and chicken TPC3 (TPCN3) being expressed on endosomal membranes, and human TPC2 (TPCN2) on lysosomal membranes when expressed in HEK293 cells. Membranes enriched with TPC2 show high affinity NAADP binding, and TPC2 underpins NAADP-induced Ca(2+) release from lysosome-related stores that is subsequently amplified by Ca(2+)-induced Ca(2+) release by InsP3Rs. Responses to NAADP were abolished by disrupting the lysosomal proton gradient and by ablating TPC2 expression, but were only attenuated by depleting endoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) stores or by blocking InsP3Rs. Thus, TPCs form NAADP receptors that release Ca(2+) from acidic organelles, which can trigger further Ca(2+) signals via sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum. TPCs therefore provide new insights into the regulation and organization of Ca(2+) signals in animal cells, and will advance our understanding of the physiological role of NAADP.","[Hao, Xuemei; Tang, Jisen; Xiao, Rui; Wang, Chunbo; Zhu, Yingmin; Lin, Yakang; Zhu, Michael X.] Ohio State Univ, Dept Neurosci, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Hao, Xuemei; Tang, Jisen; Xiao, Rui; Wang, Chunbo; Zhu, Yingmin; Lin, Yakang; Zhu, Michael X.] Ohio State Univ, Ctr Mol Neurobiol, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Calcraft, Peter J.; Wyatt, Christopher N.; Evans, A.

Furthermore, many of the deficiencies normally observed in Bmi1(-/-) mice improve after either pharmacological treatment with the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine or genetic disruption of the DNA damage response pathway by Chk2 (also known as Chek2) deletion. These results demonstrate that Bmi1 has an unexpected role in maintaining mitochondrial function and redox homeostasis and indicate that the Polycomb family of proteins can coordinately regulate cellular metabolism with stem and progenitor cell function.","[Liu, Jie; Cao, Liu; Song, Shiwei; Lee, In Hye; Quijano, Celia; Liu, Hongjun; Chen, Haoqian; Cao, Long-Yue; Ahn, Bong-Hyun; Kumar, Neil G.; Rovira, Ilsa I.; Finkel, Toren] NHLBI, Translat Med Branch, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Cao, Liu; Keyvanfar, Keyvan] NHLBI, Hematol Branch, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Kumar, Neil G.] NIH, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Res Scholar Program, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Xu, Xiao-Ling; Deng, Chu-Xia] NIDDKD, Genet Dev & Dis Branch, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [van Lohuizen, Maarten] Netherlands Canc Inst, Div Mol Genet, NL-1066 CX Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Motoyama, Noboru] Natl Ctr Geriatr & Gerontol, Natl Inst Longev Sci, Dept Geriatr Med, Aichi 4748522, Japan","Finkel, T (reprint author), NHLBI, Translat Med Branch, NIH, Bldg 10, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA.",Liu.Cao@nih.gov; finkelt@nih.gov,"deng, chuxia/N-6713-2016",,Howard Hughes Medical Institute; Intramural NIH HHS [Z01 HL005012-11]; NIA NIH HHS [R00 AG032356],,,38,257,266,3,34,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,21-May,2009,459,7245,,,,,387,U100,,10.1038/nature08040,,7,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,448DQ,WOS:000266243700037,19404261,No,,,11/20/17

In 1966, it was hypothesized that in AADase the origin of the large pK(a) perturbation (-4.5 log units) observed in the nucleophilic Lys 115 results from the proximity of Lys 116, marking the first proposal of microenvironment effects in enzymology. The electrostatic perturbation hypothesis has been demonstrated in a number of enzymes, but never for the enzyme that inspired its conception, owing to the lack of a three-dimensional structure. Here we present the X-ray crystal structures of AADase and of the enamine adduct with the substrate analogue 2,4-pentanedione. Surprisingly, the shift of the pK(a) of Lys 115 is not due to the proximity of Lys 116, the side chain of which is oriented away from the active site. Instead, Lys 116 participates in the structural anchoring of Lys 115 in a long, hydrophobic funnel provided by the novel fold of the enzyme. Thus, AADase perturbs the pK(a) of the nucleophile by means of a desolvation effect by placement of the side chain into the protein core while enforcing the proximity of polar residues, which facilitate decarboxylation through electrostatic and steric effects.","[Ho, Meng-Chiao; Menetret, Jean-Francois; Allen, Karen N.] Boston Univ, Sch Med, Dept Physiol & Biophys, Boston, MA 02118 USA; [Tsuruta, Hiro] SLAC Natl Accelerator Lab, Stanford Synchrotron Radiat Lightsource, Menlo Pk, CA 94025 USA","Allen, KN (reprint author), Boston Univ, Dept Chem, 590 Commonwealth Ave, Boston, MA 02215 USA.",drkallen@bu.edu,"Ho, Meng-Chiao/H-2448-2015","Allen, Karen/0000-0001-7296-0551",National Science Foundation; Offices of Biological and Environmental Research (BER); Basic Energy Sciences (BES) of the US Department of Energy (DOE); National Center for Research Resources (NCRR) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH),"We thank A.

Such evolved stars could provide stringent tests of stellar theory, as many uncertainties of the internal stellar structure accumulate with age. Important examples are convective overshooting and rotational mixing during the central hydrogen-burning phase, which determine the mass of the helium core, but which are not well understood(1). In principle, analysis of radial and non-radial stellar oscillations can be used to constrain the mass of the helium core. Although all giants are expected to oscillate(2), it has hitherto been unclear whether non-radial modes are observable at all in red giants, or whether the oscillation modes have a short or a long mode lifetime(3-7), which determines the observational precision of the frequencies. Here we report the presence of radial and non-radial oscillations in more than 300 giant stars. For at least some of the giants, the mode lifetimes are of the order of a month. We observe giant stars with equally spaced frequency peaks in the Fourier spectrum of the time series, as well as giants for which the spectrum seems to be more complex.

Several lines of evidence, however, suggest that Mars has been cold with mean global temperatures well below the freezing point of pure water(4). Martian climate modellers(5,6) considering a combination of greenhouse gases at a range of partial pressures find it challenging to simulate global mean Martian surface temperatures above 273 K, and local thermal sources(7,8) cannot account for the widespread distribution of hydrated and evaporitic minerals throughout the Martian landscape(3). Solutes could depress the melting point of water(9,10) in a frozen Martian environment, providing a plausible solution to the early Mars climate paradox. Here we model the freezing and evaporation processes of Martian fluids with a composition resulting from the weathering of basalts, as reflected in the chemical compositions at Mars landing sites. Our results show that a significant fraction of weathering fluids loaded with Si, Fe, S, Mg, Ca, Cl, Na, K and Al remain in the liquid state at temperatures well below 273 K. We tested our model by analysing the mineralogies yielded by the evolution of the solutions: the resulting mineral assemblages are analogous to those actually identified on the Martian surface. This stability against freezing of Martian fluids can explain saline liquid water activity on the surface of Mars at mean global temperatures well below 273 K.","[Fairen, Alberto G.; Davila, Alfonso F.; McKay, Christopher P.] NASA, Ames Res Ctr, Space Sci & Astrobiol Div, Moffett Field, CA 94035 USA; [Gago-Duport, Luis] Univ Vigo, Dept Geociencias Marinas, Vigo 36200, Spain; [Amils, Ricardo] CSIC INTA, Ctr Astrobiol, Madrid 28850, Spain; [Amils, Ricardo] CSIC UAM, Ctr Biol Mol Severo Ochoa, Madrid 28049, Spain","Fairen, AG (reprint author), NASA, Ames Res Ctr, Space Sci & Astrobiol Div, Moffett Field, CA 94035 USA.",alberto.g.fairen@nasa.gov,"Davila, Alfonso/A-2198-2013","Davila, Alfonso/0000-0002-0977-9909",ORAU-NPP,Work by A.

Prominent examples include the discovery of exotic superconductivity proximate to conventional spin and charge order(1,2), and the crossover from long-range phase order to preformed pairs achieved in gases of cold fermions(3-5) and inferred for copper oxide superconductors(5). The unifying theme is that incompatible ground states can be connected by quantum phase transitions. Quantum fluctuations about the transition are manifestations of the competition between qualitatively distinct organizing principles(6,7), such as a long-wavelength density wave and a short-coherence-length condensate. They may even give rise to 'protected' phases, like fluctuation-mediated superconductivity that survives only in the vicinity of an antiferromagnetic quantum critical point(8,9). However, few model systems that demonstrate continuous quantum phase transitions have been identified, and the complex nature of many systems of interest hinders efforts to more fully understand correlations and fluctuations near a zero-temperature instability. Here we report the suppression of magnetism by hydrostatic pressure in elemental chromium, a simple cubic metal that demonstrates a subtle form of itinerant antiferromagnetism(10-16) formally equivalent to the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) state in conventional superconductors. By directly measuring the associated charge order in a diamond anvil cell at low temperatures, we find a phase transition at pressures of similar to 10 GPa driven by fluctuations that destroy the BCS-like state but preserve the strong magnetic interaction between itinerant electrons and holes. Chromium is unique among stoichiometric magnetic metals studied so far in that the quantum phase transition is continuous, allowing experimental access to the quantum singularity and a direct probe of the competition between conventional and exotic order in a theoretically tractable material.","[Jaramillo, R.; Feng, Yejun; Rosenbaum, T.

Although wavelength(1-3), polarization(4-8) and spatial dimensions(9-13) have all been exploited for multiplexing, these approaches have never been integrated into a single technique that could ultimately increase the information capacity by orders of magnitude. The major hurdle is the lack of a suitable recording medium that is extremely selective in the domains of wavelength and polarization and in the three spatial domains, so as to provide orthogonality in all five dimensions. Here we show true five-dimensional optical recording by exploiting the unique properties of the longitudinal surface plasmon resonance (SPR) of gold nanorods. The longitudinal SPR exhibits an excellent wavelength and polarization sensitivity, whereas the distinct energy threshold required for the photothermal recording mechanism provides the axial selectivity. The recordings were detected using longitudinal SPR-mediated two-photon luminescence, which we demonstrate to possess an enhanced wavelength and angular selectivity compared to conventional linear detection mechanisms. Combined with the high cross-section of two-photon luminescence, this enabled non-destructive, crosstalk-free readout. This technique can be immediately applied to optical patterning, encryption and data storage, where higher data densities are pursued.","[Zijlstra, Peter; Chon, James W.

We also show hierarchical assembly of structures such as homomultimeric linear tracks and heterotrimeric wireframe icosahedra.

That such a diverse suite of solar system materials share this feature is interpreted to be the result of a post-primary-accretion cataclysmic spike in the number of impacts commonly referred to as the late heavy bombardment (LHB)(1-7). Despite its obvious significance to the preservation of crust and the survivability of an emergent biosphere, the thermal effects of this bombardment on the young Earth remain poorly constrained. Here we report numerical models constructed to probe the degree of thermal metamorphism in the crust in the effort to recreate the effect of the LHB on the Earth as a whole; outputs were used to assess habitable volumes of crust for a possible near-surface and subsurface primordial microbial biosphere. Our analysis shows that there is no plausible situation in which the habitable zone was fully sterilized on Earth, at least since the termination of primary accretion of the planets and the postulated impact origin of the Moon. Our results explain the root location of hyperthermophilic bacteria in the phylogenetic tree for 16S small-subunit ribosomal RNA(8), and bode well for the persistence of microbial biospheres even on planetary bodies strongly reworked by impacts.","[Abramov, Oleg; Mojzsis, Stephen J.] Univ Colorado, Dept Geol Sci, Boulder, CO 80309 USA","Abramov, O (reprint author), Univ Colorado, Dept Geol Sci, 2200 Colorado Ave,UCB 399, Boulder, CO 80309 USA.",oleg.abramov@colorado.edu,,"Abramov, Oleg/0000-0002-2884-2299",NASA Astrobiology Institute; NASA Exobiology program,"This work is funded by the NASA Astrobiology Institute (through the NASA Postdoctoral Program) and the NASA Exobiology program.

How perennials undergo repeated cycles of vegetative growth and flowering that are synchronized to the changing seasons has not been extensively studied(1). Flowering is best understood in annual Arabidopsis thaliana 2,3, but many closely related species, such as Arabis alpina(4,5), are perennials. We identified the A. alpina mutant perpetual flowering 1 (pep1), and showed that PEP1 contributes to three perennial traits. It limits the duration of flowering, facilitating a return to vegetative development, prevents some branches from undergoing the floral transition allowing polycarpic growth habit, and confers a flowering response to winter temperatures that restricts flowering to spring. Here we show that PEP1 is the orthologue of the A. thaliana gene FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC). The FLC transcription factor inhibits flowering until A. thaliana is exposed to winter temperatures(6,7), which trigger chromatin modifications that stably repress FLC transcription(8-11). In contrast, PEP1 is only transiently repressed by low temperatures, causing repeated seasonal cycles of repression and activation of PEP1 transcription that allow it to carry out functions characteristic of the cyclical life history of perennials. The patterns of chromatin modifications at FLC and PEP1 differ correlating with their distinct expression patterns. Thus we describe a critical mechanism by which flowering regulation differs between related perennial and annual species, and propose that differences in chromatin regulation contribute to this variation.","[Wang, Renhou; Farrona, Sara; Vincent, Coral; Joecker, Anika; Schoof, Heiko; Turck, Franziska; Coupland, George; Albani, Maria C.] Max Planck Inst Plant Breeding Res, D-50829 Cologne, Germany; [Alonso-Blanco, Carlos] CSIC, Ctr Nacl Biotecnol, Dept Genet Mol Plantas, E-28049 Madrid, Spain","Coupland, G (reprint author), Max Planck Inst Plant Breeding Res, Carl von Linne Weg 10, D-50829 Cologne, Germany.",coupland@mpiz-koeln.mpg.de; albani@mpiz-koeln.mpg.de,"Alonso-Blanco, Carlos/F-8864-2016; Turck, Franziska/G-1240-2013","Alonso-Blanco, Carlos/0000-0002-4738-5556; Turck, Franziska/0000-0002-4982-5949",Max Planck Society,The authors would like to thank P.

In mammalian cells, protein levels also vary(8-10) and individual cells differ widely in their responsiveness to uniform physiological stimuli(11-15). In the case of apoptosis mediated by TRAIL (tumour necrosis factor (TNF)related apoptosis-inducing ligand) it is common for some cells in a clonal population to die while others survive-a striking divergence in cell fate. Among cells that die, the time between TRAIL exposure and caspase activation is highly variable. Here we image sister cells expressing reporters of caspase activation and mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization after exposure to TRAIL. We show that naturally occurring differences in the levels or states of proteins regulating receptor-mediated apoptosis are the primary causes of cell-to-cell variability in the timing and probability of death in human cell lines. Protein state is transmitted from mother to daughter, giving rise to transient heritability in fate, but protein synthesis promotes rapid divergence so that sister cells soon become no more similar to each other than pairs of cells chosen at random. Our results have implications for understanding 'fractional killing' of tumour cells after exposure to chemotherapy, and for variability in mammalian signal transduction in general.","[Spencer, Sabrina L.; Gaudet, Suzanne; Albeck, John G.; Burke, John M.; Sorger, Peter K.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Syst Biol, Ctr Cell Decis Proc, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Spencer, Sabrina L.] MIT, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA","Sorger, PK (reprint author), Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Syst Biol, Ctr Cell Decis Proc, Boston, MA 02115 USA.",peter_sorger@hms.harvard.edu,,"Gaudet, Suzanne/0000-0002-5701-2825; Sorger, Peter/0000-0002-3364-1838; SPENCER, SABRINA/0000-0002-5798-3007","National Institute of Health [GM68762, CA112967]","We thank D.

Interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta) is a key pro-inflammatory factor in innate antifungal immunity(2). The mechanism by which the mammalian immune system regulates IL-1 beta production after fungal recognition is unclear. Two signals are generally required for IL-1 beta production: an NF-kappa B-dependent signal that induces the synthesis of pro-IL-1 beta (p35), and a second signal that triggers proteolytic pro-IL-1 beta processing to produce bioactive IL-1 beta (p17) via Caspase-1-containing multiprotein complexes called inflammasomes(3). Here we demonstrate that the tyrosine kinase Syk, operating downstream of several immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM)-coupled fungal pattern recognition receptors, controls both pro-IL-1 beta synthesis and inflammasome activation after cell stimulation with Candida albicans. Whereas Syk signalling for pro-IL-1 beta synthesis selectively uses the Card9 pathway, inflammasome activation by the fungus involves reactive oxygen species production and potassium efflux. Genetic deletion or pharmalogical inhibition of Syk selectively abrogated inflammasome activation by C. albicans but not by inflammasome activators such as Salmonella typhimurium or the bacterial toxin nigericin. Nlrp3 (also known as NALP3) was identified as the critical NOD-like receptor family member that transduces the fungal recognition signal to the inflammasome adaptor Asc (Pycard) for Caspase-1 (Casp1) activation and pro-IL-1 beta processing. Consistent with an essential role for Nlrp3 inflammasomes in antifungal immunity, we show that Nlrp3-deficient mice are hypersusceptible to Candida albicans infection. Thus, our results demonstrate the molecular basis for IL-1 beta production after fungal infection and identify a crucial function for the Nlrp3 inflammasome in mammalian host defence in vivo.","[Gross, Olaf; Poeck, Hendrik; Hannesschlaeger, Nicole; Ruland, Juergen] Tech Univ Munich, Klinikum Rechts Isar, Med Klin 3, D-81675 Munich, Germany; [Gross, Olaf; Dostert, Catherine; Tardivel, Aubry; Tschopp, Juerg] Univ Lausanne, Dept Biochem, CH-1066 Epalinges, Switzerland; [Bscheider, Michael; Endres, Stefan] Univ Munich, Dept Internal Med, Div Clin Pharmacol, D-80539 Munich, Germany; [Hartmann, Gunther] Univ Klinikum Bonn, Inst Clin Chem & Pharmacol, D-53127 Bonn, Germany; [Schweighoffer, Edina; Tybulewicz, Victor] Natl Inst Med Res, London NW7 1AA, England; [Mocsai, Attila] Semmelweis Univ, Sch Med, Budapest, Hungary","Ruland, J (reprint author), Tech Univ Munich, Klinikum Rechts Isar, Med Klin 3, Ismaninger Str 22, D-81675 Munich, Germany.",jruland@lrz.tum.de,"Mocsai, Attila/B-2792-2008; Gross, Olaf/E-4570-2010; Hartmann, Gunther/P-7492-2017","Hartmann, Gunther/0000-0003-1021-2018; Mocsai, Attila/0000-0002-0512-1157; Tybulewicz, Victor/0000-0003-2439-0798",Marie Curie RTN ApopTrain Fellowship; Swiss National Science Foundation; Deutsche Krebshilfe; Sonderforschungsbereich; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft,"We thank C.

Because targeted genome modification in plants has been intractable(1), plant trait engineering remains a laborious, time-consuming and unpredictable undertaking. Here we report a broadly applicable, versatile solution to this problem: the use of designed zinc-finger nucleases (ZFNs) that induce a double-stranded break at their target locus(2). We describe the use of ZFNs to modify endogenous loci in plants of the crop species Zea mays. We show that simultaneous expression of ZFNs and delivery of a simple heterologous donor molecule leads to precise targeted addition of an herbicide-tolerance gene at the intended locus in a significant number of isolated events. ZFN-modified maize plants faithfully transmit these genetic changes to the next generation. Insertional disruption of one target locus, IPK1, results in both herbicide tolerance and the expected alteration of the inositol phosphate profile in developing seeds. ZFNs can be used in any plant species amenable to DNA delivery; our results therefore establish a new strategy for plant genetic manipulation in basic science and agricultural applications.","[Shukla, Vipula K.; Worden, Sarah E.; Mitchell, Jon C.; Arnold, Nicole L.; Zhifang, Gao; McCaskill, David; Simpson, Matthew A.; Blakeslee, Beth; Greenwalt, Scott A.; Butler, Holly J.] Dow AgroSci, Indianapolis, IN 46268 USA; [Doyon, Yannick; Miller, Jeffrey C.; DeKelver, Russell C.; Moehle, Erica A.; Gopalan, Sunita; Meng, Xiangdong; Choi, Vivian M.; Rock, Jeremy M.; Wu, Ying-Ying; Katibah, George E.; Hinkley, Sarah J.; Zhang, Lei; Rebar, Edward J.; Gregory, Philip D.; Urnov, Fyodor D.] Point Richmond Tech Ctr, Richmond, CA 94804 USA","Shukla, VK (reprint author), Dow AgroSci, 9330 Zionsville Rd, Indianapolis, IN 46268 USA.",vkshukla@dow.com,,"Doyon, Yannick/0000-0002-3889-9563",,,,44,382,416,7,153,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,21-May,2009,459,7245,,,,,437,U156,,10.1038/nature07992,,7,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,448DQ,WOS:000266243700048,19404259,No,,,11/20/17

Zinc-finger nucleases (ZFNs)-enzymes engineered to create DNA double-strand breaks at specific loci-are potent stimulators of gene targeting(1,2); for example, they can be used to precisely modify engineered reporter genes in plants(3,4). Here we demonstrate high-frequency ZFN-stimulated gene targeting at endogenous plant genes, namely the tobacco acetolactate synthase genes (ALS SuRA and SuRB), for which specific mutations are known to confer resistance to imidazolinone and sulphonylurea herbicides(5). Herbicide-resistance mutations were introduced into SuR loci by ZFN-mediated gene targeting at frequencies exceeding 2% of transformed cells for mutations as far as 1.3 kilobases from the ZFN cleavage site. More than 40% of recombinant plants had modifications in multiple SuR alleles. The observed high frequency of gene targeting indicates that it is now possible to efficiently make targeted sequence changes in endogenous plant genes.","[Voytas, Daniel F.] Univ Minnesota, Dept Genet Cell Biol & Dev, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA; [Voytas, Daniel F.] Univ Minnesota, Ctr Genome Engn, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA; [Townsend, Jeffrey A.; Wright, David A.; Winfrey, Ronnie J.; Fu, Fengli] Iowa State Univ, Dept Genet Dev & Cell Biol, Ames, IA 50011 USA; [Maeder, Morgan L.; Joung, J.

Such gradients are used in many essential processes, notably for generating action potentials. Na+, K+-ATPase is a member of the P-type ATPases, which include sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase and gastric H+, K+-ATPase, among others, and is the target of cardiac glycosides. Here we describe a crystal structure of this important ion pump, from shark rectal glands, consisting of alpha- and beta-subunits and a regulatory FXYD protein(3,4), all of which are highly homologous to human ones. The ATPase was fixed in a state analogous to E2 center dot 2K(+)center dot P-i, in which the ATPase has a high affinity for K+ and still binds P-i, as in the first crystal structure of pig kidney enzyme at 3.5 angstrom resolution(5). Clearly visualized now at 2.4 angstrom resolution are coordination of K+ and associated water molecules in the transmembrane binding sites and a phosphate analogue (MgF42-) in the phosphorylation site. The crystal structure shows that the beta-subunit has a critical role in K+ binding (although its involvement has previously been suggested(6-8)) and explains, at least partially, why the homologous Ca2+-ATPase counter-transports H+ rather than K+, despite the coordinating residues being almost identical.","[Shinoda, Takehiro; Ogawa, Haruo; Toyoshima, Chikashi] Univ Tokyo, Inst Mol & Cellular Biosci, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo 1130032, Japan; [Cornelius, Flemming] Univ Aarhus, Dept Physiol & Biophys, DK-8000 Aarhus C, Denmark","Toyoshima, C (reprint author), Univ Tokyo, Inst Mol & Cellular Biosci, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo 1130032, Japan.",ct@iam.u-tokyo.ac.jp,,"Cornelius, Flemming/0000-0003-1566-0020","Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology of Japan; Danish Medical Research Council","We thank M.

The speed of transduction is facilitated by rapid ACh association and dissociation, suggesting a binding site relatively non-selective for small cations. Selective transduction has been thought to originate from the ability of ACh, over that of other organic cations, to trigger the subsequent channel-opening step. However, transitions to and from the open state were shown to be similar for agonists with widely different efficacies(1-3). By studying mutant AChRs, we show here that the ultimate closed-to-open transition is agonist-independent and preceded by two primed closed states; the first primed state elicits brief openings, whereas the second elicits long-lived openings. Long-lived openings and the associated primed state are detected in the absence and presence of an agonist, and exhibit the same kinetic signatures under both conditions. By covalently locking the agonist-binding sites in the bound conformation, we find that each site initiates a priming step. Thus, a change in binding-site conformation primes the AChR for channel opening in a process that enables selective activation by ACh while maximizing the speed and efficiency of the biological response.","[Mukhtasimova, Nuriya; Lee, Won Yong; Wang, Hai-Long; Sine, Steven M.] Mayo Clin, Coll Med, Dept Physiol & Biomed Engn, Receptor Biol Lab, Rochester, MN 55905 USA; [Sine, Steven M.] Mayo Clin, Coll Med, Dept Neurol, Rochester, MN 55905 USA","Sine, SM (reprint author), Mayo Clin, Coll Med, Dept Physiol & Biomed Engn, Receptor Biol Lab, Rochester, MN 55905 USA.",sine@mayo.edu,,,National Institutes of Health [NS031744],"We thank D.

The resultant regulation of gene function is thought to govern cell fate, proliferation and differentiation(2). Reversible histone modifications such as methylation are under mutual controls to organize chromosomal events(3,4). Among the histone modifications, methylation of specific lysine and arginine residues seems to be critical for chromatin configuration and control of gene expression(5). Methylation of histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4) changes chromatin into a transcriptionally active state(6). Reversible modification of proteins by beta-N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) in response to serum glucose levels regulates diverse cellular processes(7,8,9). However, the epigenetic impact of protein GlcNAcylation is unknown. Here we report that nuclear GlcNAcylation of a histone lysine methyltransferase (HKMT), MLL5, by O-GlcNAc transferase facilitates retinoic-acid-induced granulopoiesis in human HL60 promyelocytes through methylation of H3K4. MLL5 is biochemically identified in a GlcNAcylation-dependent multi-subunit complex associating with nuclear retinoic acid receptor RAR alpha (also known as RARA), serving as a mono-and di-methyl transferase to H3K4. GlcNAcylation at Thr 440 in the MLL5 SET domain evokes its H3K4 HKMT activity and co-activates RARa in target gene promoters. Increased nuclear GlcNAcylation by means of O-GlcNAc transferase potentiates retinoic-acid-induced HL60 granulopoiesis and restores the retinoic acid response in the retinoic-acid-resistant HL60-R2 cell line. Thus, nuclear MLL5 GlcNAcylation triggers cell lineage determination of HL60 through activation of its HKMT activity.","[Fujiki, Ryoji; Chikanishi, Toshihiro; Hashiba, Waka; Ito, Hiroaki; Takada, Ichiro; Kitagawa, Hirochika; Kato, Shigeaki] Univ Tokyo, Inst Mol & Cellular Biosci, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo 1130032, Japan; [Fujiki, Ryoji; Chikanishi, Toshihiro; Kato, Shigeaki] Japan Sci & Technol Agcy, ERATO, Kawaguchi, Saitama 3320012, Japan; [Roeder, Robert G.] Rockefeller Univ, Biochem & Mol Biol Lab, New York, NY 10021 USA","Kato, S (reprint author), Univ Tokyo, Inst Mol & Cellular Biosci, Bunkyo Ku, 1-1-1 Yayoi, Tokyo 1130032, Japan.",uskato@mail.ecc.u-tokyo.ac.jp,,,"Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology","We thank A.

In G1 phase, the absence of a sister chromatid means that repair of DSBs occurs through non-homologous end-joining or microhomology-mediated end-joining (MMEJ)(1). These pathways often involve loss of DNA sequences at the break site and are therefore error-prone. In late S and G2 phases, even though DNA end-joining pathways remain functional(2), there is an increase in repair of DSBs by homologous recombination, which is mostly error-free(3,4). Consequently, the relative contribution of these different pathways to DSB repair in the cell cycle has a large influence on the maintenance of genetic integrity. It has remained unknown how DSBs are directed for repair by different, potentially competing, repair pathways. Here we identify a role for CtIP (also known as RBBP8) in this process in the avian B-cell line DT40. We establish that CtIP is required not only for repair of DSBs by homologous recombination in S/G2 phase but also for MMEJ in G1. The function of CtIP in homologous recombination, but not MMEJ, is dependent on the phosphorylation of serine residue 327 and recruitment of BRCA1. Cells expressing CtIP protein that cannot be phosphorylated at serine 327 are specifically defective in homologous recombination and have a decreased level of single-stranded DNA after DNA damage, whereas MMEJ remains unaffected. Our data support a model in which phosphorylation of serine 327 of CtIP as cells enter S phase and the recruitment of BRCA1 functions as a molecular switch to shift the balance of DSB repair from error-prone DNA end-joining to error-free homologous recombination.","[Yun, Maximina H.; Hiom, Kevin] MRC, Mol Biol Lab, Div Prot & Nucle Acid Chem, Cambridge CB2 0QH, England","Hiom, K (reprint author), MRC, Mol Biol Lab, Div Prot & Nucle Acid Chem, Hills Rd, Cambridge CB2 0QH, England.",hiom@mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk,,,"Medical Research Council [MC_U105184300, U.1051.03.005(78826)]",,,21,257,265,0,22,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,21-May,2009,459,7245,,,,,460,U184,,10.1038/nature07955,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,448DQ,WOS:000266243700053,19357644,No,,,11/20/17

The parasites causing African sleeping sickness respond to citrate or cis-aconitate (CCA) to initiate life-cycle development when transmitted to their tsetse fly vector. This requires hypersensitization of the parasites to CCA by exposure to low temperature, conditions encountered after tsetse fly feeding at dusk or dawn. Here we identify a carboxylate-transporter family, PAD (proteins associated with differentiation), required for perception of this differentiation signal. Consistent with predictions for the response of trypanosomes to CCA, PAD proteins are expressed on the surface of the transmission-competent 'stumpy-form' parasites in the bloodstream, and at least one member is thermoregulated, showing elevated expression and surface access at low temperature. Moreover, RNA-interference-mediated ablation of PAD expression diminishes CCA-induced differentiation and eliminates CCA hypersensitivity under cold-shock conditions. As well as being molecular transducers of the differentiation signal in these parasites, PAD proteins provide the first example of a surface marker able to discriminate the transmission stage of trypanosomes in their mammalian host.","[Dean, Samuel; Matthews, Keith R.] Univ Edinburgh, Sch Biol Sci, Inst Immunol & Infect Res, Ctr Immun Infect & Evolut, Edinburgh EH9 3JT, Midlothian, Scotland; [Marchetti, Rosa; Kirk, Kiaran] Australian Natl Univ, Sch Biochem & Mol Biol, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia","Matthews, KR (reprint author), Univ Edinburgh, Sch Biol Sci, Inst Immunol & Infect Res, Ctr Immun Infect & Evolut, W Mains Rd, Edinburgh EH9 3JT, Midlothian, Scotland.",keith.matthews@ed.ac.uk,"Kirk, Kiaran/C-8299-2009","Kirk, Kiaran/0000-0002-5613-2622; Dean, Samuel/0000-0002-4792-2198","Wellcome Trust; BBSRC studentship; Wellcome Trust Programme; Centre for Immunity, Infection and Evolution; BBSRC REI","We thank E.

To understand how the representation of such odours leads to behaviour, we used genetic tools to dissect the contribution of each activated glomerulus. Apple cider vinegar triggers robust innate attraction at a relatively low concentration, which activates six glomeruli. By silencing individual glomeruli, here we show that the absence of activity in two glomeruli, DM1 and VA2, markedly reduces attraction. Conversely, when each of these two glomeruli was selectively activated, flies showed as robust an attraction to vinegar as wild-type flies. Notably, a higher concentration of vinegar excites an additional glomerulus and is less attractive to flies. We show that activation of the extra glomerulus is necessary and sufficient to mediate the behavioural switch. Together, these results indicate that individual glomeruli, rather than the entire pattern of active glomeruli, mediate innate behavioural output.","[Semmelhack, Julia L.; Wang, Jing W.] Univ Calif San Diego, Div Biol Sci, Neurobiol Sect, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA","Wang, JW (reprint author), Univ Calif San Diego, Div Biol Sci, Neurobiol Sect, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.",jw800@ucsd.edu,"Wang, Jing/C-3885-2008","Wang, Jing/0000-0001-6291-5802; Semmelhack, Julie/0000-0002-8154-264X",Whitehall Foundation; National Institute of Deafness and other Communication Disorders [R01DC009597],"We would like to thank D.

Here we report mid-infrared features in the outburst spectrum of the young Sun-like star EX Lupi that were not present in quiescence. We attribute them to crystalline forsterite. We conclude that the crystals were produced through thermal annealing in the surface layer of the inner disk by heat from the outburst, a process that has hitherto not been considered.

Yet the grains found in comets(1) and meteorites(2), and traced in the spectra of young stars(3), include large crystalline grains that must have undergone annealing or condensation at temperatures in excess of 1,000 K, even though they are mixed with surrounding material that never experienced temperatures as high as that(4). This prompted theories of large-scale mixing capable of transporting thermally altered grains from the inner, hot part of accretion disks to outer, colder disk regions(5-7), but all have assumptions that may be problematic(8-12). Here I report that infrared radiation arising from the dusty disk can loft grains bigger than one micrometre out of the inner disk, whereupon they are pushed outwards by stellar radiation pressure while gliding above the disk. Grains re-enter the disk at radii where it is too cold to produce sufficient infrared radiation-pressure support for a given grain size and solid density. Properties of the observed disks suggest that this process might be active in almost all young stellar objects and young brown dwarfs.","Univ Split, Dept Phys, Split 21000, Croatia","Vinkovic, D (reprint author), Univ Split, Dept Phys, Nikole Tesle 12, Split 21000, Croatia.",vinkovic@pmfst.hr,,"Vinkovic, Dejan/0000-0001-9082-3921",,,,30,26,26,0,2,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,14-May,2009,459,7244,,,,,227,229,,10.1038/nature08032,,3,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,445FR,WOS:000266036100035,19444210,No,,,11/20/17

In typical granular materials and foams, the thermal energy is too small to produce structural rearrangements. In this zero-temperature (T = 0) limit, multiple diverging(1-8) and vanishing(2,9,10) length scales characterize the approach to a sharp jamming transition. However, because thermal motion becomes relevant when the particles are small enough, it is imperative to understand how these length scales evolve as the temperature is increased. Here we used both colloidal experiments and computer simulations to progress beyond the zero-temperature limit to track one of the key parameters-the overlap distance between neighbouring particles-which vanishes at the T = 0 jamming transition. We find that this structural feature retains a vestige of its T = 0 behaviour and evolves in an unusual manner, which has masked its appearance until now. It is evident as a function of packing fraction at fixed temperature, but not as a function of temperature at fixed packing fraction or pressure. Our results conclusively demonstrate that length scales associated with the T = 0 jamming transition persist in thermal systems, not only in simulations but also in laboratory experiments.","[Zhang, Zexin; Xu, Ning; Chen, Daniel T.

High internal quantum efficiencies for the conversion of electrical energy to light have been realized(2-4). Nevertheless, the overall device power efficiencies are still considerably below the 60-70 lumens per watt of fluorescent tubes, which is the current benchmark for novel light sources. Although some reports about highly power-efficient white OLEDs exist(5,6), details about structure and the measurement conditions of these structures have not been fully disclosed: the highest power efficiency reported in the scientific literature is 44 lm W-1 (ref. 7). Here we report an improved OLED structure which reaches fluorescent tube efficiency. By combining a carefully chosen emitter layer with high-refractive-index substrates(8,9), and using a periodic outcoupling structure, we achieve a device power efficiency of 90 lm W-1 at 1,000 candelas per square metre. This efficiency has the potential to be raised to 124 lm W-1 if the light outcoupling can be further improved. Besides approaching internal quantum efficiency values of one, we have also focused on reducing energetic and ohmic losses that occur during electron-photon conversion. We anticipate that our results will be a starting point for further research, leading to white OLEDs having efficiencies beyond 100 lm W-1. This could make white-light OLEDs, with their soft area light and high colour-rendering qualities, the light sources of choice for the future.","[Reineke, Sebastian; Lindner, Frank; Schwartz, Gregor; Seidler, Nico; Walzer, Karsten; Luessem, Bjoern; Leo, Karl] Inst Angew Photophys, D-01062 Dresden, Germany","Leo, K (reprint author), Inst Angew Photophys, George Bahr Str 1, D-01062 Dresden, Germany.",leo@iapp.de,"Reineke, Sebastian/F-9693-2010; Seidler, Nico/G-8616-2011; Schwartz, Gregor/I-7531-2012; Lussem, Bjorn/B-6776-2013; Leo, Karl/L-1125-2013; Reineke, Sebastian/G-9894-2014","Seidler, Nico/0000-0003-2787-9732; Schwartz, Gregor/0000-0003-0061-6959; Reineke, Sebastian/0000-0002-4112-6991",European Commission [IST-2002-004607]; Leibniz Prize of the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft,"We thank the European Commission within the sixth framework IST programme under contract IST-2002-004607 ( project OLLA), for funding.

According to one version of the 'RNA world' hypothesis(1-3) this polymer was RNA, but attempts to provide experimental support for this have failed(4,5). In particular, although there has been some success demonstrating that 'activated' ribonucleotides can polymerize to form RNA(6,7), it is far from obvious how such ribonucleotides could have formed from their constituent parts ( ribose and nucleobases). Ribose is difficult to form selectively(8,9), and the addition of nucleobases to ribose is inefficient in the case of purines(10) and does not occur at all in the case of the canonical pyrimidines(11). Here we show that activated pyrimidine ribonucleotides can be formed in a short sequence that bypasses free ribose and the nucleobases, and instead proceeds through arabinose amino-oxazoline and anhydronucleoside intermediates. The starting materials for the synthesis-cyanamide, cyanoacetylene, glycolaldehyde, glyceraldehyde and inorganic phosphate-are plausible prebiotic feedstock molecules(12-15), and the conditions of the synthesis are consistent with potential early-Earth geochemical models. Although inorganic phosphate is only incorporated into the nucleotides at a late stage of the sequence, its presence from the start is essential as it controls three reactions in the earlier stages by acting as a general acid/base catalyst, a nucleophilic catalyst, a pH buffer and a chemical buffer. For prebiotic reaction sequences, our results highlight the importance of working with mixed chemical systems in which reactants for a particular reaction step can also control other steps.","[Powner, Matthew W.; Gerland, Beatrice; Sutherland, John D.] Univ Manchester, Sch Chem, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England","Sutherland, JD (reprint author), Univ Manchester, Sch Chem, Oxford Rd, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England.",john.sutherland@manchester.ac.uk,,"Powner, Matthew/0000-0002-6368-3190",UK Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council,This work has been funded by the UK Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council through the provision of a postdoctoral fellowship ( B.

Labrador Sea Water (LSW), formed by open ocean convection in the subpolar North Atlantic, is a particularly sensitive indicator of climate change on interannual to decadal timescales(1-3). Hydrographic observations made anywhere along the western boundary of the North Atlantic reveal a core of LSW at intermediate depths advected southward within the Deep Western Boundary Current (DWBC)(4-9). These observations have led to the widely held view that the DWBC is the dominant pathway for the export of LSW from its formation site in the northern North Atlantic towards the Equator(10,11). Here we show that most of the recently ventilated LSW entering the subtropics follows interior, not DWBC, pathways. The interior pathways are revealed by trajectories of subsurface RAFOS floats released during the period 2003-2005 that recorded once-daily temperature, pressure and acoustically determined position for two years, and by model-simulated 'e-floats' released in the subpolar DWBC. The evidence points to a few specific locations around the Grand Banks where LSW is most often injected into the interior. These results have implications for deep ocean ventilation and suggest that the interior subtropical gyre should not be ignored when considering the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation.","[Bower, Amy S.] Woods Hole Oceanog Inst, Dept Phys Oceanog, Woods Hole, MA 02540 USA; [Lozier, M.

This discovery predates the well-known Venuses from the Gravettian culture by at least 5,000 years and radically changes our views of the context and meaning of the earliest Palaeolithic art.","Univ Tubingen, Abt Altere Urgeschichte & Quartarokol, Inst Ur & Fruhgeschichte & Archaol Mittelalters, D-72070 Tubingen, Germany","Conard, NJ (reprint author), Univ Tubingen, Abt Altere Urgeschichte & Quartarokol, Inst Ur & Fruhgeschichte & Archaol Mittelalters, D-72070 Tubingen, Germany.",nicholas.conard@uni-tuebingen.de,,,Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft; University of Tubingen; Heidelberger Akademie der Wissenschaften; Landesamt fur Denkmalpflege Baden-Wurttemberg; Alb-Donau-Kreis; Heidelberg Cement; Museumsgesellschaft Schelklingen; Gesellschaft fur Urgeschichte,"Many colleagues, including S.

The fact that microbial interactions can be manipulated in ways that animal interactions cannot has led to a growing interest in microbial models of cooperation(4-10) and competition(11,12). For the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae to grow on sucrose, the disaccharide must first be hydrolysed by the enzyme invertase(13,14). This hydrolysis reaction is performed outside the cytoplasm in the periplasmic space between the plasma membrane and the cell wall. Here we demonstrate that the vast majority ( 99 per cent) of the monosaccharides created by sucrose hydrolysis diffuse away before they can be imported into the cell, serving to make invertase production and secretion a cooperative behaviour(15,16). A mutant cheater strain that does not produce invertase is able to take advantage of and invade a population of wild-type cooperator cells. However, over a wide range of conditions, the wild-type cooperator can also invade a population of cheater cells. Therefore, we observe steady-state coexistence between the two strains in well-mixed culture resulting from the fact that rare strategies outperform common strategies-the defining features of what game theorists call the snowdrift game(17). A model of the cooperative interaction incorporating nonlinear benefits explains the origin of this coexistence. We are able to alter the outcome of the competition by varying either the cost of cooperation or the glucose concentration in the media. Finally, we note that glucose repression of invertase expression in wild-type cells produces a strategy that is optimal for the snowdrift game-wild-type cells cooperate only when competing against cheater cells.","[Gore, Jeff; Youk, Hyun; van Oudenaarden, Alexander] MIT, Dept Phys, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA","van Oudenaarden, A (reprint author), MIT, Dept Phys, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",avano@mit.edu,"Youk, Hyun/E-2661-2016","Youk, Hyun/0000-0003-1687-5760",Pappalardo Postdoctoral Fellowship; NIH K99 Pathways to Independence; Lester Wolfe Fellowship,"The authors would like to thank D.

This ability is highly conserved across species(2,3) and is believed to be critical for filial attachment and for detection of predators(4). The neural underpinnings of biological motion perception are overlapping with brain regions involved in perception of basic social signals such as facial expression and gaze direction(5), and preferential attention to biological motion is seen as a precursor to the capacity for attributing intentions to others(6). However, in a serendipitous observation(7), we recently found that an infant with autism failed to recognize point-light displays of biological motion, but was instead highly sensitive to the presence of a non-social, physical contingency that occurred within the stimuli by chance. This observation raised the possibility that perception of biological motion may be altered in children with autism from a very early age, with cascading consequences for both social development and the lifelong impairments in social interaction that are a hallmark of autism spectrum disorders(8). Here we show that two-year-olds with autism fail to orient towards point-light displays of biological motion, and their viewing behaviour when watching these point-light displays can be explained instead as a response to non-social, physical contingencies-physical contingencies that are disregarded by control children. This observation has far-reaching implications for understanding the altered neurodevelopmental trajectory of brain specialization in autism(9).","[Klin, Ami; Lin, David J.; Gorrindo, Phillip; Ramsay, Gordon; Jones, Warren] Yale Univ, Sch Med, Yale Child Study Ctr, New Haven, CT 06519 USA; [Ramsay, Gordon] Haskins Labs Inc, New Haven, CT 06511 USA; [Jones, Warren] Yale Univ, Sch Med, Interdepartmental Neurosci Program, New Haven, CT 06520 USA","Klin, A (reprint author), Yale Univ, Sch Med, Yale Child Study Ctr, New Haven, CT 06519 USA.",ami.klin@yale.edu; warren.jones@yale.edu,,"Gorrindo, Phillip/0000-0002-0296-8790",National Institutes of Mental Health [U54-MH66494]; Autism Speaks; Simons Foundation,"This work was supported by a grant from the National Institutes of Mental Health (U54-MH66494), by Autism Speaks (piloting of methods), and by the Simons Foundation ( current methodological developments).

Several such 'metatranscriptomic' studies(1,2) have reported that many complementary DNA sequences shared no significant homology with known peptide sequences, and so might represent transcripts from uncharacterized proteins. Here we report that a large fraction of cDNA sequences detected in microbial metatranscriptomic data sets are comprised of well-known small RNAs ( sRNAs) 3, as well as new groups of previously unrecognized putative sRNAs ( psRNAs). These psRNAs mapped specifically to intergenic regions of microbial genomes recovered from similar habitats, displayed characteristic conserved secondary structures and were frequently flanked by genes that indicated potential regulatory functions. Depth-dependent variation of psRNAs generally reflected known depth distributions of broad taxonomic groups(4), but fine-scale differences in the psRNAs within closely related populations indicated potential roles in niche adaptation. Genome-specific mapping of a subset of psRNAs derived from predominant planktonic species such as Pelagibacter revealed recently discovered as well as potentially new regulatory elements. Our analyses show that metatranscriptomic data sets can reveal new information about the diversity, taxonomic distribution and abundance of sRNAs in naturally occurring microbial communities, and indicate their involvement in environmentally relevant processes including carbon metabolism and nutrient acquisition.","[Shi, Yanmei; Tyson, Gene W.; DeLong, Edward F.] MIT, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [DeLong, Edward F.] MIT, Dept Biol Engn, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA","DeLong, EF (reprint author), MIT, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",delong@mit.edu,"Tyson, Gene/C-6558-2013",,Craig Venter Institute; Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation for the genome sequence of Pelagibacter [HTCC7211]; Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation; National Science Foundation Microbial Observatory [MCB-0348001]; Department of Energy Genomics GTL Program; Department of Energy Microbial Genomics Program; NSF Science and Technology award; C-MORE,"We are grateful to the University of Hawaii HOT team, and the captain and crew of the RV Kilo Moana for their expert assistance at sea.

Monotherapy and highly mutable drug targets have each facilitated resistance, and both are undesirable in effective long-term strategies against multi-drug-resistant malaria. Haem remains an immutable and vulnerable target, because it is not parasite-encoded and its detoxification during haemoglobin degradation, critical to parasite survival, can be subverted by drug-haem interaction as in the case of quinolines and many other drugs(1-5). Here we describe a new antimalarial chemotype that combines the haem-targeting character of acridones, together with a chemosensitizing component that counteracts resistance to quinoline antimalarial drugs. Beyond the essential intrinsic characteristics common to deserving candidate antimalarials ( high potency in vitro against pan-sensitive and multi-drug-resistant Plasmodium falciparum, efficacy and safety in vivo after oral administration, inexpensive synthesis and favourable physicochemical properties), our initial lead, T3.5 (3-chloro-6-(2-diethylamino-ethoxy)-10-(2-diethylamino-ethyl)acridone), demonstrates unique synergistic properties. In addition to 'verapamil-like' chemosensitization to chloroquine and amodiaquine against quinoline-resistant parasites, T3.5 also results in an apparently mechanistically distinct synergism with quinine and with piperaquine. This synergy, evident in both quinoline-sensitive and quinoline-resistant parasites, has been demonstrated both in vitro and in vivo. In summary, this innovative acridone design merges intrinsic potency and resistance-counteracting functions in one molecule, and represents a new strategy to expand, enhance and sustain effective antimalarial drug combinations.","[Kelly, Jane X.; Smilkstein, Martin J.; Janowsky, Aaron; Johnson, Robert A.; Dodean, Rozalia A.; Winter, Rolf; Hinrichs, David J.; Riscoe, Michael K.] Portland VA Med Ctr, Portland, OR 97239 USA; [Kelly, Jane X.; Smilkstein, Martin J.; Dodean, Rozalia A.; Winter, Rolf; Riscoe, Michael K.] Portland State Univ, Dept Chem, Portland, OR 97201 USA; [Smilkstein, Martin J.; Janowsky, Aaron; Johnson, Robert A.; Hinrichs, David J.; Riscoe, Michael K.] Oregon Hlth & Sci Univ, Portland, OR 97239 USA; [Brun, Reto; Wittlin, Sergio] Swiss Trop Inst, CH-4002 Basel, Switzerland; [Cooper, Roland A.; Lane, Kristin D.] Old Dominion Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Norfolk, VA 23529 USA","Kelly, JX (reprint author), Portland VA Med Ctr, Portland, OR 97239 USA.",kellyja@ohsu.edu; riscoem@ohsu.edu,,,Merit Review Program of the Department of Veterans Affairs,"We thank D.

In addition to small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) and microRNAs, several types of endogenously produced small RNAs have important roles in gene regulation, germ cell maintenance and transposon silencing(1-4). The production of some of these RNAs requires the synthesis of aberrant RNAs (aRNAs) or pre-siRNAs, which are specifically recognized by RNA-dependent RNA polymerases to make double-stranded RNA. The mechanism for aRNA synthesis and recognition is largely unknown. Here we show that DNA damage induces the expression of the Argonaute protein QDE-2 and a new class of small RNAs in the filamentous fungus Neurospora crassa. This class of small RNAs, known as qiRNAs because of their interaction with QDE-2, are about 20-21 nucleotides long (several nucleotides shorter than Neurospora siRNAs), with a strong preference for uridine at the 59 end, and originate mostly from the ribosomal DNA locus. The production of qiRNAs requires the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase QDE-1, the Werner and Bloom RecQ DNA helicase homologue QDE-3 and dicers. qiRNA biogenesis also requires DNA-damage-induced aRNAs as precursors, a process that is dependent on both QDE-1 and QDE-3. Notably, our results suggest that QDE-1 is the DNA-dependent RNA polymerase that produces aRNAs. Furthermore, the Neurospora RNA interference mutants show increased sensitivity to DNA damage, suggesting a role for qiRNAs in the DNA-damage response by inhibiting protein translation.","[Lee, Heng-Chi; Chang, Shwu-Shin; Choudhary, Swati; Maiti, Mekhala; Liu, Yi] Univ Texas SW Med Ctr Dallas, Dept Physiol, Dallas, TX 75390 USA; [Aalto, Antti P.; Bamford, Dennis H.] Univ Helsinki, Inst Biotechnol, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland; [Aalto, Antti P.; Bamford, Dennis H.] Univ Helsinki, Dept Biol & Environm Sci, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland","Liu, Y (reprint author), Univ Texas SW Med Ctr Dallas, Dept Physiol, 5323 Harry Hines Blvd, Dallas, TX 75390 USA.",yi.liu@UTSouthwestern.edu,,"Bamford, Dennis/0000-0002-6438-8118","Welch Foundation; National Institutes of Health (NIH); Academy of Finland Finnish Centre of Excellence [1213467, 1213992]; Helsinki Graduate School in Biotechnology and Molecular Biology","We thank L.

This protozoan parasite evades the host immune system by antigenic variation, a periodic switching of its variant surface glycoprotein (VSG) coat. VSG switching is spontaneous and occurs at a rate of about 10(-2)-10(-3) per population doubling in recent isolates from nature, but at a markedly reduced rate (10(-5)-10(-6)) in laboratory-adapted strains(1-3). VSG switching is thought to occur predominantly through gene conversion, a form of homologous recombination initiated by a DNA lesion that is used by other pathogens (for example, Candida albicans, Borrelia sp. and Neisseria gonorrhoeae) to generate surface protein diversity, and by B lymphocytes of the vertebrate immune system to generate antibody diversity. Very little is known about the molecular mechanism of VSG switching in T. brucei. Here we demonstrate that the introduction of a DNA double-stranded break (DSB) adjacent to the similar to 70-base-pair ( bp) repeats upstream of the transcribed VSG gene increases switching in vitro similar to 250-fold, producing switched clones with a frequency and features similar to those generated early in an infection. We were also able to detect spontaneous DSBs within the 70-bp repeats upstream of the actively transcribed VSG gene, indicating that a DSB is a natural intermediate of VSG gene conversion and that VSG switching is the result of the resolution of this DSB by break-induced replication.","[Boothroyd, Catharine E.; Leonova, Tatyana; Ly, K.

Increased histone-tail acetylation induced by inhibitors of histone deacetylases (HDACis) facilitates learning and memory in wild-type mice as well as in mouse models of neurodegeneration. Harnessing the therapeutic potential of HDACis requires knowledge of the specific HDAC family member(s) linked to cognitive enhancement. Here we show that neuron-specific overexpression of HDAC2, but not that of HDAC1, decreased dendritic spine density, synapse number, synaptic plasticity and memory formation. Conversely, Hdac2 deficiency resulted in increased synapse number and memory facilitation, similar to chronic treatment with HDACis in mice. Notably, reduced synapse number and learning impairment of HDAC2-overexpressing mice were ameliorated by chronic treatment with HDACis. Correspondingly, treatment with HDACis failed to further facilitate memory formation in Hdac2-deficient mice. Furthermore, analysis of promoter occupancy revealed an association of HDAC2 with the promoters of genes implicated in synaptic plasticity and memory formation. Taken together, our results suggest that HDAC2 functions in modulating synaptic plasticity and long-lasting changes of neural circuits, which in turn negatively regulates learning and memory. These observations encourage the development and testing of HDAC2-selective inhibitors for human diseases associated with memory impairment.","[Guan, Ji-Song; Joseph, Nadine; Gao, Jun; Zhou, Ying; Wang, Xinyu; Tsai, Li-Huei] MIT, Dept Brain & Cognit Sci, Picower Inst Learning & Memory, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Guan, Ji-Song; Joseph, Nadine; Gao, Jun; Zhou, Ying; Wang, Xinyu; Tsai, Li-Huei] MIT, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Guan, Ji-Song; Haggarty, Stephen J.; Joseph, Nadine; Nieland, Thomas J.

An overdensity of them in one region of the sky (the SSA 22 field) traces out a filamentary structure in the early Universe at a redshift of z approximate to 3.1 (equivalent to 15 per cent of the age of the Universe) and is believed to mark a forming protocluster(3,4). Galaxies that are bright at (sub) millimetre wavelengths are undergoing violent episodes of star formation(5-8), and there is evidence that they are preferentially associated with high-redshift radio galaxies(9), so the question of whether they are also associated with the most significant large-scale structure growing at high redshift (as outlined by Lyman-alpha emitters) naturally arises. Here we report an imaging survey of 1,100-mu m emission in the SSA 22 region. We find an enhancement of submillimetre galaxies near the core of the protocluster, and a large-scale correlation between the submillimetre galaxies and the low-mass Lyman-alpha emitters, suggesting synchronous formation of the two very different types of star-forming galaxy within the same structure at high redshift.

Theoretical calculations indicate that the electron-phonon interaction is not strong enough to give rise to such high transition temperatures(6), but strong ferromagnetic/antiferromagnetic fluctuations have been proposed to be responsible(7-9). Superconductivity and magnetism in pnictide superconductors, however, show a strong sensitivity to the crystal lattice, suggesting the possibility of unconventional electron-phonon coupling. Here we report the effect of oxygen and iron isotope substitution on T-C and the spin-density wave (SDW) transition temperature (T-SDW) in the SmFeAsO1-xFx and Ba1-xKxFe2As2 systems. The oxygen isotope effect on T-C and T-SDW is very small, while the iron isotope exponent alpha(C) =-dlnT(C)/dlnM is about 0.35 (0.5 corresponds to the full isotope effect). Surprisingly, the iron isotope exchange shows the same effect on T-SDW as T-C. This indicates that electron-phonon interaction plays some role in the superconducting mechanism, but a simple electron-phonon coupling mechanism seems unlikely because a strong magnon-phonon coupling is included.","[Liu, R.

Although biology is replete with materials systems that actively and functionally respond to mechanical stimuli, the default mechanochemical reaction of bulk polymers to large external stress is the unselective scission of covalent bonds, resulting in damage or failure(7). An alternative to this degradation process is the rational molecular design of synthetic materials such that mechanical stress favourably alters material properties. A few mechanosensitive polymers with this property have been developed(8-14); but their active response is mediated through non-covalent processes, which may limit the extent to which properties can be modified and the long-term stability in structural materials. Previously, we have shown with dissolved polymer strands incorporating mechanically sensitive chemical groups-so-called mechanophores-that the directional nature of mechanical forces can selectively break and re-form covalent bonds(15,16). We now demonstrate that such force-induced covalent-bond activation can also be realized with mechanophore-linked elastomeric and glassy polymers, by using a mechanophore that changes colour as it undergoes a reversible electrocyclic ring-opening reaction under tensile stress and thus allows us to directly and locally visualize the mechanochemical reaction. We find that pronounced changes in colour and fluorescence emerge with the accumulation of plastic deformation, indicating that in these polymeric materials the transduction of mechanical force into the ring-opening reaction is an activated process. We anticipate that force activation of covalent bonds can serve as a general strategy for the development of new mechanophore building blocks that impart polymeric materials with desirable functionalities ranging from damage sensing to fully regenerative self-healing.","[Yang, Jinglei; Braun, Paul V.; Martinez, Todd J.; White, Scott R.; Moore, Jeffrey S.; Sottos, Nancy R.] Univ Illinois, Beckman Inst, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Davis, Douglas A.; Cremar, Lee D.; Potisek, Stephanie L.; Ong, Mitchell T.; Braun, Paul V.; Martinez, Todd J.; Moore, Jeffrey S.] Univ Illinois, Dept Chem, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Hamilton, Andrew] Univ Illinois, Dept Engn Sci & Mech, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Van Gough, Dara; Braun, Paul V.; Moore, Jeffrey S.; Sottos, Nancy R.] Univ Illinois, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [White, Scott R.] Univ Illinois, Dept Aerosp Engn, Urbana, IL 61801 USA","Sottos, NR (reprint author), Univ Illinois, Beckman Inst, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.",n-sottos@illinois.edu,"Van Gough, Dara/B-8646-2011; Martinez, Todd/F-4306-2010; Hamilton, Andrew/C-2978-2013; Yang, Jinglei/B-1933-2008; Albe, Karsten/F-1139-2011","Martinez, Todd/0000-0002-4798-8947; Hamilton, Andrew/0000-0003-4627-849X; Yang, Jinglei/0000-0002-9413-9016; White, Scott/0000-0002-0831-9097",ARO MURI programme [W911NF-07-1-0409],We acknowledge the support of the ARO MURI programme (grant number W911NF-07-1-0409) for this research.,,27,582,588,53,536,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,7-May,2009,459,7243,,,,,68,72,,10.1038/nature07970,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,441WN,WOS:000265801300030,19424152,No,Y,N,11/20/17

Several assembly strategies have been developed for building complex three-dimensional (3D) DNA nanostructures(2-8). Recently, the DNA 'origami' method was used to build two-dimensional addressable DNA structures of arbitrary shape(9) that can be used as platforms to arrange nanomaterials with high precision and specificity(9-13). A long-term goal of this field has been to construct fully addressable 3D DNA nanostructures(14,15). Here we extend the DNA origami method into three dimensions by creating an addressable DNA box 42 x 36 x 36 nm(3) in size that can be opened in the presence of externally supplied DNA 'keys'. We thoroughly characterize the structure of this DNA box using cryogenic transmission electron microscopy, small-angle X-ray scattering and atomic force microscopy, and use fluorescence resonance energy transfer to optically monitor the opening of the lid. Controlled access to the interior compartment of this DNA nanocontainer could yield several interesting applications, for example as a logic sensor for multiple-sequence signals or for the controlled release of nanocargos.","[Andersen, Ebbe S.; Dong, Mingdong; Nielsen, Morten M.; Jahn, Kasper; Subramani, Ramesh; Mamdouh, Wael; Besenbacher, Flemming; Gothelf, Kurt V.; Kjems, Jorgen] Aarhus Univ, Danish Natl Res Fdn, Ctr DNA Nanotechnol, DK-8000 Aarhus, Denmark; [Andersen, Ebbe S.; Dong, Mingdong; Nielsen, Morten M.; Jahn, Kasper; Subramani, Ramesh; Mamdouh, Wael; Oliveira, Cristiano L.

Although carbonatite magmatism has occurred throughout Earth's history, Oldoinyo Lengai, in Tanzania, is the only currently active volcano producing these exotic rocks(1). Here we show that volcanic gases captured during an eruptive episode at Oldoinyo Lengai are indistinguishable from those emitted along mid-ocean ridges, despite the fact that Oldoinyo Lengai carbonatites occur in a setting far removed from oceanic spreading centres. In contrast to lithophile trace elements, which are highly fractionated by the immiscible phase separation that produces these carbonatites, volatiles (CO(2), He, N(2) and Ar) are little affected by this process. Our results demonstrate that a globally homogenous reservoir exists in the upper mantle and supplies volatiles to both mid-ocean ridges and continental rifts. This argues against an unusually C-rich mantle being responsible for the genesis of Na-rich carbonatite and its nephelinite source magma at Oldoinyo Lengai. Rather, these carbonatites are formed in the shallow crust by immiscibility from silicate magmas (nephelinite), and are stable under eruption conditions as a result of their high Na contents.","[Fischer, T.

The skeleton of the type specimen (LB1) of H. floresiensis includes a relatively complete left foot and parts of the right foot(3). These feet provide insights into the evolution of bipedalism and, together with the rest of the skeleton, have implications for hominin dispersal events into Asia. Here we show that LB1's foot is exceptionally long relative to the femur and tibia, proportions never before documented in hominins but seen in some African apes. Although the metatarsal robusticity sequence is human-like and the hallux is fully adducted, other intrinsic proportions and pedal features are more ape-like. The postcranial anatomy of H. floresiensis is that of a biped(1-3), but the unique lower-limb proportions and surprising combination of derived and primitive pedal morphologies suggest kinematic and biomechanical differences from modern human gait. Therefore, LB1 offers the most complete glimpse of a bipedal hominin foot that lacks the full suite of derived features characteristic of modern humans and whose mosaic design may be primitive for the genus Homo. These new findings raise the possibility that the ancestor of H. floresiensis was not Homo erectus but instead some other, more primitive, hominin whose dispersal into southeast Asia is still undocumented.","[Jungers, W.

J,"Weston, EM; Lister, AM",,,,"Weston, Eleanor M.; Lister, Adrian M.",,,Insular dwarfism in hippos and a model for brain size reduction in Homo floresiensis,NATURE,,,English,Article,,,,,,,EVOLUTION; ALLOMETRY; MORPHOLOGY; PLEISTOCENE; PRIMATES; HOMININ; SAPIENS; DMANISI; GEORGIA; RULES,"Body size reduction in mammals is usually associated with only moderate brain size reduction, because the brain and sensory organs complete their growth before the rest of the body during ontogeny(1,2). On this basis, 'phyletic dwarfs' are predicted to have a greater relative brain size than 'phyletic giants'(1,3). However, this trend has been questioned in the special case of dwarfism of mammals on islands(4). Here we show that the endocranial capacities of extinct dwarf species of hippopotamus from Madagascar are up to 30% smaller than those of a mainland African ancestor scaled to equivalent body mass. These results show that brain size reduction is much greater than predicted from an intraspecific 'late ontogenetic' model of dwarfism in which brain size scales to body size with an exponent of 0.35. The nature of the proportional change or grade shift(2,5) observed here indicates that selective pressures on brain size are potentially independent of those on body size. This study demonstrates empirically that it is mechanistically possible for dwarf mammals on islands to evolve significantly smaller brains than would be predicted from a model of dwarfing based on the intraspecific scaling of the mainland ancestor. Our findings challenge current understanding of brain-body allometric relationships in mammals and suggest that the process of dwarfism could in principle explain small brain size, a factor relevant to the interpretation of the small-brained hominin found on the Island of Flores, Indonesia(6).","[Weston, Eleanor M.; Lister, Adrian M.] Nat Hist Museum, Dept Palaeontol, London SW7 5BD, England","Weston, EM (reprint author), Nat Hist Museum, Dept Palaeontol, Cromwell Rd, London SW7 5BD, England.",e.weston@nhm.ac.uk,,,"Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council [, BB/D522689/1, BB/D522689/2]",,,30,60,61,5,52,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,7-May,2009,459,7243,,,,,85,U88,,10.1038/nature07922,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,441WN,WOS:000265801300034,19424156,No,,,11/20/17
