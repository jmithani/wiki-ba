The membrane serves as a barrier as well as a special environment in which membrane proteins are able to carry out important processes. Certain membrane proteins have the ability to detect the membrane voltage and regulate ion conduction or enzyme activity(1,2). Such voltage-dependent processes rely on the action of protein domains known as voltage sensors, which are embedded inside the cell membrane and contain an excess of positively charged amino acids, which react to an electric field. How does the membrane create an environment suitable for voltage sensors? Here we show under a variety of conditions that the function of a voltage-dependent K(+) channel is dependent on the negatively charged phosphodiester of phospholipid molecules. A non-voltage-dependent K(+) channel does not exhibit the same dependence. The data lead us to propose that the phospholipid membrane, by providing stabilizing interactions between positively charged voltage-sensor arginine residues and negatively charged lipid phosphodiester groups, provides an appropriate environment for the energetic stability and operation of the voltage-sensing machinery. We suggest that the usage of arginine residues in voltage sensors is an adaptation to the phospholipid composition of cell membranes.","Rockefeller Univ, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Lab Mol Neurobiol & Biophys, New York, NY 10021 USA","MacKinnon, R (reprint author), Rockefeller Univ, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Lab Mol Neurobiol & Biophys, 1230 York Ave, New York, NY 10021 USA.",mackinn@rockefeller.edu,,,,,,20,275,278,2,36,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,7-Dec,2006,444,7120,,,,,775,779,,10.1038/nature05416,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,113EL,WOS:000242581100064,17136096,No,,,11/20/17

We have combined bioinformatics, biochemistry and genetics to derive an RNA map describing the rules by which Nova proteins regulate alternative splicing. This map revealed that the position of Nova binding sites (YCAY clusters) in a pre-messenger RNA determines the outcome of splicing. The map correctly predicted Nova's effect to inhibit or enhance exon inclusion, which led us to examine the relationship between the map and Nova's mechanism of action. Nova binding to an exonic YCAY cluster changed the protein complexes assembled on pre-mRNA, blocking U1 snRNP ( small nuclear ribonucleoprotein) binding and exon inclusion, whereas Nova binding to an intronic YCAY cluster enhanced spliceosome assembly and exon inclusion. Assays of splicing intermediates of Nova-regulated transcripts in mouse brain revealed that Nova preferentially regulates removal of introns harbouring ( or closest to) YCAY clusters. These results define a genome-wide map relating the position of a cis-acting element to its regulation by an RNA binding protein, namely that Nova binding to YCAY clusters results in a local and asymmetric action to regulate spliceosome assembly and alternative splicing in neurons.","Rockefeller Univ, Howard Hughes Med Inst, New York, NY 10021 USA; Rockefeller Univ, Mol Neurooncol Lab, New York, NY 10021 USA; Rockefeller Univ, Lab Computat Genom, New York, NY 10021 USA; Univ Toronto, Banting & Best Dept Med Res, Toronto, ON M5G 1L6, Canada","Darnell, RB (reprint author), Rockefeller Univ, Howard Hughes Med Inst, 1230 York Ave, New York, NY 10021 USA.",darnelr@rockefeller.edu,"Darnell, Robert/B-9022-2008; Ule, Jernej/C-6315-2013","Darnell, Robert/0000-0002-5134-8088; Ule, Jernej/0000-0002-2452-4277; Stefani, Giovanni/0000-0002-8782-6811",Howard Hughes Medical Institute,,,50,305,309,0,22,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,30-Nov,2006,444,7119,,,,,580,586,,10.1038/nature05304,,7,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,110KK,WOS:000242377600040,17065982,No,,,11/20/17

It is known(1-9) that it calculated and displayed celestial information, particularly cycles such as the phases of the moon and a luni-solar calendar. Calendars were important to ancient societies(10) for timing agricultural activity and fixing religious festivals. Eclipses and planetary motions were often interpreted as omens, while the calm regularity of the astronomical cycles must have been philosophically attractive in an uncertain and violent world. Named after its place of discovery in 1901 in a Roman shipwreck, the Antikythera Mechanism is technically more complex than any known device for at least a millennium afterwards. Its specific functions have remained controversial(11-14) because its gears and the inscriptions upon its faces are only fragmentary. Here we report surface imaging and high-resolution X-ray tomography of the surviving fragments, enabling us to reconstruct the gear function and double the number of deciphered inscriptions. The mechanism predicted lunar and solar eclipses on the basis of Babylonian arithmetic-progression cycles. The inscriptions support suggestions of mechanical display of planetary positions(9,14,15), now lost. In the second century BC, Hipparchos developed a theory to explain the irregularities of the Moon's motion across the sky caused by its elliptic orbit. We find a mechanical realization of this theory in the gearing of the mechanism, revealing an unexpected degree of technical sophistication for the period.","Cardiff Univ, Sch Phys & Astron, Cardiff CF24 3AA, Wales; Images First Ltd, London W5 4SE, England; Natl & Kapodistrian Univ Athens, Dept Astrophys Astron & Mech, GR-15783 Panepistimiopolis, Zographos, Greece; Aristotle Univ Thessaloniki, Dept Phys, Sect Astrophys Astron & Mech, GR-54124 Thessaloniki, Greece; Natl Bank Greece Cultural Fdn, Ctr Hist & Palaeog, GR-10560 Athens, Greece; Natl Archaeol Museum Athens, GR-10682 Athens, Greece; X Tek Syst Ltd, Tring Business Ctr, Tring HP23 4JX, Herts, England; Hewlett Packard Labs, Palo Alto, CA 94304 USA; Foxhollow Technol Inc, Redwood City, CA 94063 USA","Edmunds, MG (reprint author), Cardiff Univ, Sch Phys & Astron, Queens Bldg, Cardiff CF24 3AA, Wales.",mge@astro.cf.ac.uk,,,,,,29,93,95,3,28,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,30-Nov,2006,444,7119,,,,,587,591,,10.1038/nature05357,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,110KK,WOS:000242377600041,17136087,No,,,11/20/17

Despite intense interest in using power laws to characterize such distributions, most analyses have been concerned with observations at a single instant of time, with little analysis of objects or events that change in size through time ( notwithstanding some significant exceptions(5-7)). It is now clear that the evident macro-stability in such distributions at different times can mask a volatile and often turbulent micro-dynamics, in which objects can change their position or rank-order rapidly while their aggregate distribution appears quite stable. Here I introduce a graphical representation termed the 'rank clock' to examine such dynamics for three distributions: the size of cities in the US from AD 1790, the UK from AD1901 and the world from 430 BC. Our results destroy any notion that rank - size scaling is universal: at the micro-level, these clocks show cities and civilizations rising and falling in size at many times and on many scales. The conventional model explaining such scaling on the basis of growth by proportionate effect cannot replicate these micro-dynamics, suggesting that such models and explanations are considerably less general than has hitherto been assumed.","UCL, Bartlett Sch, Ctr Adv Spatial Anal, London WC1E 6BT, England","Batty, M (reprint author), UCL, Bartlett Sch, Ctr Adv Spatial Anal, 1-19 Torrington Pl, London WC1E 6BT, England.",m.batty@ucl.ac.uk,"Batty, Michael/I-5638-2014",,,,,25,82,89,6,26,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,30-Nov,2006,444,7119,,,,,592,596,,10.1038/nature05302,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,110KK,WOS:000242377600042,17136088,No,,,11/20/17

This is especially important for the technologically relevant terahertz ( 1 THz = 10(12) Hz) frequency regime; many materials inherently do not respond to THz radiation, and the tools that are necessary to construct devices operating within this range - sources, lenses, switches, modulators and detectors - largely do not exist. Considerable efforts are underway to fill this 'THz gap' in view of the useful potential applications of THz radiation(2-7). Moderate progress has been made in THz generation and detection(8); THz quantum cascade lasers are a recent example(9). However, techniques to control and manipulate THz waves are lagging behind. Here we demonstrate an active metamaterial device capable of efficient real-time control and manipulation of THz radiation. The device consists of an array of gold electric resonator elements ( the metamaterial) fabricated on a semiconductor substrate. The metamaterial array and substrate together effectively form a Schottky diode, which enables modulation of THz transmission by 50 per cent, an order of magnitude improvement over existing devices(10).","Los Alamos Natl Lab, Ctr Integrated Nanotechnol, Mat Phys & Applicat Div, Los Alamos, NM 87545 USA; Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Mat, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA","Chen, HT (reprint author), Los Alamos Natl Lab, Ctr Integrated Nanotechnol, Mat Phys & Applicat Div, POB 1663, Los Alamos, NM 87545 USA.",chenht@lanl.gov,"Chen, Hou-Tong/C-6860-2009; Zide, Joshua/B-5105-2010; Padilla, Willie/A-7235-2008","Chen, Hou-Tong/0000-0003-2014-7571; Zide, Joshua/0000-0002-6378-7221; Padilla, Willie/0000-0001-7734-8847",,,,29,1129,1153,58,595,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,30-Nov,2006,444,7119,,,,,597,600,,10.1038/nature05343,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,110KK,WOS:000242377600043,17136089,No,,,11/20/17

The possibility of abrupt changes in Gulf Stream heat transport is one of the key uncertainties in predictions of climate change for the coming centuries. Given the limited length of the instrumental record, our knowledge of Gulf Stream behaviour on long timescales must rely heavily on information from geologic archives. Here we use foraminifera from a suite of high-resolution sediment cores in the Florida Straits to show that the cross-current density gradient and vertical current shear of the Gulf Stream were systematically lower during the Little Ice Age ( AD 1200 to 1850). We also estimate that Little Ice Age volume transport was ten per cent weaker than today's. The timing of reduced flow is consistent with temperature minima in several palaeoclimate records(4-9), implying that diminished oceanic heat transport may have contributed to Little Ice Age cooling in the North Atlantic. The interval of low flow also coincides with anomalously high Gulf Stream surface salinity(10), suggesting a tight linkage between the Atlantic Ocean circulation and hydrologic cycle during the past millennium.","MIT Woods Hole Oceanog Inst Joint Program Oceanog, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA; Georgia Inst Technol, Sch Earth & Atmospher Sci, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA; Woods Hole Oceanog Inst, Dept Geol & Geophys, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA","Lund, DC (reprint author), CALTECH, Div Geol & Planetary Sci, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA.",dlund@gps.caltech.edu,,"Lynch-Stieglitz, Jean/0000-0002-9353-1972",,,,30,112,114,4,37,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,30-Nov,2006,444,7119,,,,,601,604,,10.1038/nature05277,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,110KK,WOS:000242377600044,17136090,No,,,11/20/17

Using a parameterization of melting experiments on peridotite(3) with glass analyses from the Hawaii Scientific Deep Project 2 on Mauna Kea volcano(1), I show here that a small population of the core samples had fractionated from a peridotite-source primary magma. Most lavas, however, differentiated from magmas that were too deficient in CaO and enriched in NiO ( ref. 2) to have formed from a peridotite source. For these, experiments indicate that they were produced by the melting of garnet pyroxenite, a lithology that had formed in a second stage by reaction of peridotite with partial melts of subducted oceanic crust(2). Samples in the Hawaiian core are therefore consistent with previous suggestions that pyroxenite occurs in a host peridotite, and both contribute to melt production(2,4). Primary magma compositions vary down the drill core, and these reveal evidence for temperature variations within the underlying mantle plume. Mauna Kea magmatism is represented in other Hawaiian volcanoes, and provides a key for a general understanding of melt production in lithologically heterogeneous mantle.","Rutgers State Univ, Dept Geol Sci, Piscataway, NJ 08854 USA","Herzberg, C (reprint author), Rutgers State Univ, Dept Geol Sci, Piscataway, NJ 08854 USA.",herzberg@rci.rutgers.edu,,,,,,30,135,142,0,41,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,30-Nov,2006,444,7119,,,,,605,609,,10.1038/nature05254,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,110KK,WOS:000242377600045,17136091,No,,,11/20/17

This function of sleep has been linked to slow (<1 Hz) potential oscillations, which predominantly arise from the prefrontal neocortex and characterize slow wave sleep(2-4). However, oscillations in brain potentials are commonly considered to be mere epiphenomena that reflect synchronized activity arising from neuronal networks, which links the membrane and synaptic processes of these neurons in time(5). Whether brain potentials and their extracellular equivalent have any physiological meaning per se is unclear, but can easily be investigated by inducing the extracellular oscillating potential fields of interest(6-8). Here we show that inducing slow oscillation-like potential fields by transcranial application of oscillating potentials (0.75 Hz) during early nocturnal non-rapid-eye-movement sleep, that is, a period of emerging slow wave sleep, enhances the retention of hippocampus-dependent declarative memories in healthy humans. The slowly oscillating potential stimulation induced an immediate increase in slow wave sleep, endogenous cortical slow oscillations and slow spindle activity in the frontal cortex. Brain stimulation with oscillations at 5 Hz - another frequency band that normally predominates during rapid-eye-movement sleep - decreased slow oscillations and left declarative memory unchanged. Our findings indicate that endogenous slow potential oscillations have a causal role in the sleep-associated consolidation of memory, and that this role is enhanced by field effects in cortical extracellular space.","Univ Lubeck, Dept Neuroendocrinol, D-23538 Lubeck, Germany","Marshall, L (reprint author), Univ Lubeck, Dept Neuroendocrinol, Haus 23A,Ratzeburger Allee 160, D-23538 Lubeck, Germany.",marshall@kfg.uni-luebeck.de; born@kfg.uni-luebeck.de,"Born, Jan/K-2596-2016",,,,,30,694,704,9,127,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,30-Nov,2006,444,7119,,,,,610,613,,10.1038/nature05278,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,110KK,WOS:000242377600046,17086200,No,,,11/20/17

The primary DNA sequence usually specifies the regulation of individual genes, but the nature of cis-acting information that controls genes over large regions has been elusive: higher-order DNA structure, specific histone modifications, subnuclear compartmentalization and primary DNA sequence are possibilities. One paradigm of chromosome-wide gene regulation is Caenorhabditis elegans dosage compensation in which a large dosage compensation complex (DCC) is targeted to both X chromosomes of hermaphrodites to repress transcript levels by half(6). This essential process equalizes X-linked gene expression between the sexes (XO males and XX hermaphrodites). Here we report the discovery and dissection of cis-acting sites that mark nematode X chromosomes as targets for gene repression by the DCC. These rex ( recruitment element on X) sites are widely dispersed along X and reside in promoters, exons and intergenic regions. rex sites share at least two distinct motifs that act in combination to recruit the DCC. Mutating these motifs severely reduces or abolishes DCC binding in vivo, demonstrating the importance of primary DNA sequence in chromosome-wide regulation. Unexpectedly, the motifs are not enriched on X, but altering motif numbers within rex sites demonstrates that motif co-occurrence in unusually high densities is essential for optimal DCC recruitment. Thus, X-specific repression is established through sequences not specific to X. The distribution of common motifs provides the foundation for repression along an entire chromosome.","Univ Calif Berkeley, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mol & Cell Biol, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA","Meyer, BJ (reprint author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Howard Hughes Med Inst, 16 Barker Hall, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",bjmeyer@berkeley.edu,,,"Howard Hughes Medical Institute; NIGMS NIH HHS [R01 GM030702, R01 GM030702-28]",,,21,63,69,0,3,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,30-Nov,2006,444,7119,,,,,614,618,,10.1038/nature05338,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,110KK,WOS:000242377600047,17122774,No,,,11/20/17

Tube formation and elongation is dependent on the SAS-5 and SAS-6 proteins, whereas the assembly of singlet microtubules onto the central tube depends on SAS-4. We further show that centriole assembly is triggered by an upstream signal mediated by SPD-2 and ZYG-1. These results define a structural pathway for the assembly of a daughter centriole and should have general relevance for future studies on centriole assembly in other organisms.","Max Planck Inst Mol Cell Biol & Genet, D-01307 Dresden, Germany; Univ Colorado, Dept Mol Cellular & Dev Biol, Boulder Lab 3D Electron Microscopy Cells, Boulder, CO 80309 USA","Pelletier, L (reprint author), Max Planck Inst Mol Cell Biol & Genet, Pfotenhauerstr 108, D-01307 Dresden, Germany.",pelletie@mpi-cbg.de,"Hyman, Anthony/B-3917-2017","Hyman, Anthony/0000-0003-3664-154X",,,,29,217,226,0,15,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,30-Nov,2006,444,7119,,,,,619,623,,10.1038/nature05318,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,110KK,WOS:000242377600048,17136092,No,,,11/20/17

How DNA damage is detected in these arrested oocytes is poorly understood, but it is variably thought to involve p53, a central tumour suppressor in mammals(2-4). While the function of p53 in monitoring the genome of somatic cells is clear, a consensus for the importance of p53 for germ line integrity has yet to emerge. Here we show that the p53 homologue p63 (refs 5, 6), and specifically the TAp63 isoform, is constitutively expressed in female germ cells during meiotic arrest and is essential in a process of DNA damage-induced oocyte death not involving p53. We also show that DNA damage induces both the phosphorylation of p63 and its binding to p53 cognate DNA sites and that these events are linked to oocyte death. Our data support a model whereby p63 is the primordial member of the p53 family and acts in a conserved process of monitoring the integrity of the female germ line, whereas the functions of p53 are restricted to vertebrate somatic cells for tumour suppression. These findings have implications for understanding female germ line fidelity, the regulation of fertility and the evolution of tumour suppressor mechanisms.","Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Cell Biol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Biol Chem & Mol Pharmacol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Genet, Boston, MA 02115 USA; Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Pathol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; Brigham & Womens Hosp, Dept Pathol, Boston, MA 02115 USA","McKeon, F (reprint author), Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Cell Biol, Boston, MA 02115 USA.",fmckeon@hms.harvard.edu,"Bamberger, Casimir/E-7356-2011; Bamberger, Tom Casimir/D-1292-2014","Bamberger, Tom Casimir/0000-0002-3830-4486",,,,30,255,262,0,12,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,30-Nov,2006,444,7119,,,,,624,628,,10.1038/nature05337,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,110KK,WOS:000242377600049,17122775,No,,,11/20/17

The tumour suppressor p53 ( refs 4 - 7) is one of only a few non-histone proteins known to be regulated by lysine methylation(8). Here we report a lysine methyltransferase, Smyd2, that methylates a previously unidentified site, Lys 370, in p53. This methylation site, in contrast to the known site Lys 372, is repressing to p53-mediated transcriptional regulation. Smyd2 helps to maintain low concentrations of promoter-associated p53. We show that reducing Smyd2 concentrations by short interfering RNA enhances p53-mediated apoptosis. We find that Set9-mediated methylation of Lys 372 inhibits Smyd2-mediated methylation of Lys 370, providing regulatory cross-talk between post-translational modifications. In addition, we show that the inhibitory effect of Lys 372 methylation on Lys 370 methylation is caused, in part, by blocking the interaction between p53 and Smyd2. Thus, similar to histones, p53 is subject to both activating and repressing lysine methylation. Our results also predict that Smyd2 may function as a putative oncogene by methylating p53 and repressing its tumour suppressive function.","Wistar Inst Anat & Biol, Gene Express & Regulat Program, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; Vienna Bioctr, Res Inst Mol Pathol, A-1030 Vienna, Austria","Berger, SL (reprint author), Wistar Inst Anat & Biol, Gene Express & Regulat Program, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",berger@wistar.org,"Huang, Jing/A-2566-2009; Kubicek, Stefan/C-2089-2017","Huang, Jing/0000-0002-7163-5156; Kubicek, Stefan/0000-0003-0855-8343",,,,15,303,318,1,31,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,30-Nov,2006,444,7119,,,,,629,632,,10.1038/nature05287,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,110KK,WOS:000242377600050,17108971,No,,,11/20/17

One such barrier involves DNA replication stress, which leads to activation of the DNA damage checkpoint and thereby to apoptosis or cell cycle arrest(1,2), whereas a second barrier is mediated by oncogene-induced senescence(3-6). The relationship between these two barriers, if any, has not been elucidated. Here we show that oncogene-induced senescence is associated with signs of DNA replication stress, including prematurely terminated DNA replication forks and DNA double-strand breaks. Inhibiting the DNA double-strand break response kinase ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) suppressed the induction of senescence and in a mouse model led to increased tumour size and invasiveness. Analysis of human precancerous lesions further indicated that DNA damage and senescence markers cosegregate closely. Thus, senescence in human preneoplastic lesions is a manifestation of oncogene-induced DNA replication stress and, together with apoptosis, provides a barrier to malignant progression.","Wistar Inst Anat & Biol, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; Danish Canc Soc, Inst Canc Biol, DK-2100 Copenhagen, Denmark; Danish Canc Soc, Ctr Genotox Stress Res, DK-2100 Copenhagen, Denmark; Univ Athens, Sch Med, Dept Histol & Embryol, GR-11527 Athens, Greece; Demokritos Natl Ctr Sci Res, Inst Biol, GR-15310 Athens, Greece; Stockholm Univ, Dept Genet Microbiol & Toxicol, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden; Univ Ioannina, Sch Med, Dept Physiol, GR-45110 Ioannina, Greece; Natl Hellen Res Fdn, Inst Biol Res & Biotechnol, GR-11635 Athens, Greece; Univ Penn, Dept Med, Div Gastroenterol, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; Univ Copenhagen Hosp, Dept Pathol, DK-2100 Copenhagen, Denmark; Aarhus Univ Hosp, Dept Clin Biochem, DK-8200 Aarhus N, Denmark; Univ Sheffield, Inst Canc Studies, Sheffield S10 2RX, S Yorkshire, England; Univ Geneva, Dept Mol Biol, CH-1211 Geneva 4, Switzerland","Halazonetis, TD (reprint author), Wistar Inst Anat & Biol, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",Thanos.Halazonetis@molbio.unige.ch; jb@cancer.dk,"; Kletsas, Dimitris/F-6953-2010; Halazonetis, Thanos/D-7923-2011; Andersen, Claus Lindbjerg/A-9217-2012; Dyrskjot, Lars/H-4922-2012; Helleday, Thomas/D-5224-2013; Bartek, Jiri/G-5870-2014; Fugger, Kasper/J-1231-2014; Tang, Amy/L-3226-2016; Andersen, Claus/C-1477-2017","Kolettas, Evangelos/0000-0002-5820-487X; Dyrskjot, Lars/0000-0001-7061-9851; Helleday, Thomas/0000-0002-7384-092X; Andersen, Claus Lindbjerg/0000-0002-7406-2103; Fugger, Kasper/0000-0001-9811-3983; Tang, Amy/0000-0002-5772-2878; Andersen, Claus/0000-0002-7406-2103; Tort, Frederic/0000-0003-2733-1603; Lukas, Jiri/0000-0001-9087-506X",,,,30,1064,1094,8,77,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,30-Nov,2006,444,7119,,,,,633,637,,10.1038/nature05268,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,110KK,WOS:000242377600051,17136093,No,,,11/20/17

Cell proliferation and transformation induced by oncogene activation are restrained by cellular senescence(3-6). It is unclear whether DDR activation and oncogene-induced senescence (OIS) are causally linked. Here we show that senescence, triggered by the expression of an activated oncogene (H-RasV12) in normal human cells, is a consequence of the activation of a robust DDR. Experimental inactivation of DDR abrogates OIS and promotes cell transformation. DDR and OIS are established after a hyper-replicative phase occurring immediately after oncogene expression. Senescent cells arrest with partly replicated DNA and with DNA replication origins having fired multiple times. In vivo DNA labelling and molecular DNA combing reveal that oncogene activation leads to augmented numbers of active replicons and to alterations in DNA replication fork progression. We also show that oncogene expression does not trigger a DDR in the absence of DNA replication. Last, we show that oncogene activation is associated with DDR activation in a mouse model in vivo. We propose that OIS results from the enforcement of a DDR triggered by oncogene-induced DNA hyper-replication.","IFOM Fdn, FIRC Inst Mol Oncol Fdn, I-20139 Milan, Italy; European Inst Oncol, Dept Expt Oncol, I-20141 Milan, Italy; Ctr Riferimento Oncol, IRCCS, I-33081 Aviano, Italy; Inst Pasteur, Genome Stabil Unit, F-75724 Paris, France; Genom Vis, F-75724 Paris, France","di Fagagna, FD (reprint author), IFOM Fdn, FIRC Inst Mol Oncol Fdn, I-20139 Milan, Italy.",fabrizio.dadda@ifom-ieo-campus.it,"Tang, Amy/L-3226-2016; Maestro, Roberta/M-1846-2015; Gasparini, Patrizia/Q-7626-2016","Tang, Amy/0000-0002-5772-2878; Maestro, Roberta/0000-0002-6642-5592; Gasparini, Patrizia/0000-0002-9548-3724; Fumagalli, Marzia/0000-0002-2036-4544; DADDADIFAGAGNA, FABRIZIO/0000-0002-1976-3185; Nuciforo, Paolo/0000-0003-1380-0990",,,,29,860,874,5,56,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,30-Nov,2006,444,7119,,,,,638,642,,10.1038/nature05327,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,110KK,WOS:000242377600052,17136094,No,,,11/20/17

The cell - cell distribution of protein levels in microorganisms has been well characterized(7-23) but little is known about such variability in human cells. Here, we studied the variability of protein levels in human cells, as well as the temporal dynamics of this variability, and addressed whether cells with higher than average protein levels eventually have lower than average levels, and if so, over what timescale does this mixing occur. We measured fluctuations over time in the levels of 20 endogenous proteins in living human cells, tagged by the gene for yellow fluorescent protein at their chromosomal loci(24). We found variability with a standard deviation that ranged, for different proteins, from about 15% to 30% of the mean. Mixing between high and low levels occurred for all proteins, but the mixing time was longer than two cell generations ( more than 40 h) for many proteins. We also tagged pairs of proteins with two colours, and found that the levels of proteins in the same biological pathway were far more correlated than those of proteins in different pathways. The persistent memory for protein levels that we found might underlie individuality in cell behaviour and could set a timescale needed for signals to affect fully every member of a cell population.","Weizmann Inst Sci, Dept Mol Cell Biol, IL-76100 Rehovot, Israel","Alon, U (reprint author), Weizmann Inst Sci, Dept Mol Cell Biol, IL-76100 Rehovot, Israel.",uri.alon@weizmann.ac.il,,,,,,30,287,291,2,41,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,30-Nov,2006,444,7119,,,,,643,646,,10.1038/nature05316,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,110KK,WOS:000242377600053,17122776,No,,,11/20/17

We formalize this hypothesis with a dynamical model that reveals a strong analogy between behaviour of the magma-plug system and that of a variably damped oscillator. Modelled stick-slip oscillations have properties that help constrain the balance of forces governing the earthquakes and eruption, and they imply that magma pressure never deviated much from the steady equilibrium pressure.

We have constructed a first-generation CNV map of the human genome through the study of 270 individuals from four populations with ancestry in Europe, Africa or Asia (the HapMap collection). DNA from these individuals was screened for CNV using two complementary technologies: single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping arrays, and clone-based comparative genomic hybridization. A total of 1,447 copy number variable regions (CNVRs), which can encompass overlapping or adjacent gains or losses, covering 360 megabases (12% of the genome) were identified in these populations. These CNVRs contained hundreds of genes, disease loci, functional elements and segmental duplications.

Ribosome-associated trigger factor (TF) is the first molecular chaperone encountered by nascent polypeptides in bacteria. Here we show, using fluorescence spectroscopy to monitor TF function and structural rearrangements in real time, that TF interacts with ribosomes and translating polypeptides in a dynamic reaction cycle. Ribosome binding stabilizes TF in an open, activated conformation. Activated TF departs from the ribosome after a mean residence time of similar to 10 s, but may remain associated with the elongating nascent chain for up to 35 s, allowing entry of a new TF molecule at the ribosome docking site. The duration of nascent-chain interaction correlates with the occurrence of hydrophobic motifs in translating polypeptides, reflecting a high aggregation propensity. These findings can explain how TF prevents misfolding events during translation and may provide a paradigm for the regulation of nucleotide-independent chaperones.","Max Planck Inst Biochem, Dept Cellular Biochem, D-82152 Martinsried, Germany; Univ Texas, Med Branch, Dept Neurosci & Cell Biol, Galveston, TX 77555 USA","Hartl, FU (reprint author), Max Planck Inst Biochem, Dept Cellular Biochem, Klopferspitz 18, D-82152 Martinsried, Germany.",uhartl@biochem.mpg.de; jmbarral@utmb.edu,,,,,,44,131,131,2,19,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,23-Nov,2006,444,7118,,,,,455,460,,10.1038/nature05225,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,108BQ,WOS:000242215700039,17051157,No,,,11/20/17

The interplay between the magneto-static and the exchange energy favours an in-plane, closed flux domain structure. This curling magnetization turns out of the plane at the centre of the vortex structure, in an area with a radius of about 10 nanometres-the vortex core(5-7). The vortex state has a specific excitation mode: the in-plane gyration of the vortex structure about its equilibrium position(8-10). The sense of gyration is determined by the vortex core polarization(11). Here we report on the controlled manipulation of the vortex core polarization by excitation with small bursts of an alternating magnetic field. The vortex motion was imaged by time-resolved scanning transmission X-ray microscopy(12). We demonstrate that the sense of gyration of the vortex structure can be reversed by applying short bursts of the sinusoidal excitation field with amplitude of about 1.5 mT. This reversal unambiguously indicates a switching of the out-of-plane core polarization. The observed switching mechanism, which can be understood in the framework of micromagnetic theory, gives insights into basic magnetization dynamics and their possible application in data storage.","Max Planck Inst Met Res, D-70569 Stuttgart, Germany; Univ Ghent, Dept Subatom & Radiat Phys, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium; Univ Calif Berkeley, Lawrence Berkeley Lab, Adv Light Source, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; Forschungszentrum Julich, Inst Festkorperforsch Elektron Eigenschaften IFF9, D-52425 Julich, Germany; Univ Bielefeld, Fak Phys, D-33615 Bielefeld, Germany; Univ Regensburg, Inst Expt & Angew Phys, D-93040 Regensburg, Germany","Stoll, H (reprint author), Max Planck Inst Met Res, D-70569 Stuttgart, Germany.",stoll@mf.mpg.de,"Weiss, Dieter/G-4883-2016; Hertel, Riccardo/H-9964-2016; Hertel, Riccardo/P-5806-2016; Back, Christian/A-8969-2012; Reiss, Gunter/A-3423-2010","Weiss, Dieter/0000-0002-9630-9787; Hertel, Riccardo/0000-0002-0646-838X; Hertel, Riccardo/0000-0002-0646-838X; Back, Christian/0000-0003-3840-0993; Reiss, Gunter/0000-0002-0918-5940",,,,27,484,486,5,118,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,23-Nov,2006,444,7118,,,,,461,464,,10.1038/nature05240,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,108BQ,WOS:000242215700040,17122851,No,,,11/20/17

Hybrid devices combining silicon's semiconducting properties and superconductivity have therefore remained largely underdeveloped. Here we report that superconductivity can be induced when boron is locally introduced into silicon at concentrations above its equilibrium solubility. For sufficiently high boron doping (typically 100 p.p.m.) silicon becomes metallic(1). We find that at a higher boron concentration of several per cent, achieved by gas immersion laser doping, silicon becomes superconducting. Electrical resistivity and magnetic susceptibility measurements show that boron-doped silicon (Si:B) made in this way is a superconductor below a transition temperature T-c approximate to 0.35 K, with a critical field of about 0.4 T. Ab initio calculations, corroborated by Raman measurements, strongly suggest that doping is substitutional. The calculated electron-phonon coupling strength is found to be consistent with a conventional phonon-mediated coupling mechanism(2).

These static structural snapshots are important to our understanding of biomolecular function, but real biomolecules are dynamic entities that often exploit conformational changes and transient molecular interactions to perform their tasks. Nuclear magnetic resonance methods can follow such structural changes, but only on millisecond timescales under non-equilibrium conditions. Time-resolved X-ray crystallography has recently been used to monitor the photodissociation of CO from myoglobin on a subnanosecond timescale(1), yet remains challenging to apply more widely. In contrast, two-dimensional infrared spectroscopy, which maps vibrational coupling between molecular groups and hence their relative positions and orientations(2-11), is now routinely used to study equilibrium processes on picosecond timescales. Here we show that the extension of this method into the non-equilibrium regime(12,13) allows us to observe in real time in a short peptide the weakening of an intramolecular hydrogen bond and concomitant opening of a beta-turn.

Reef corals provide the habitat structure that sustains the high biodiversity of tropical reefs(7), and thus provide the foundation for the ecosystem goods and services that are critical to many tropical societies(6,8). Here we integrate predictions from oceanographic models(9) with engineering theory, to predict the dislodgement of benthic reef corals during hydrodynamic disturbances. This generalizes earlier work(10,11), by incorporating colonies of any shape and by explicitly examining the effects of hydrodynamic gradients on coral assemblage structure. Afield test shows that this model accurately predicts changes in the mechanical vulnerability of coral colonies, and thus their size and shape, with distance from the reef crest. This work provides a general framework for understanding and predicting the effects of hydrodynamic disturbances on coral reef communities; such disturbances have a major role in determining species zonation(12,13) and coexistence(14) on coral reefs, and are critical determinants of how coral assemblages will respond to changes in the frequency and intensity of tropical storms associated with a changing climate(3-5,15).","James Cook Univ N Queensland, Sch Marine & Trop Biol, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; James Cook Univ N Queensland, ARC Ctr Excellence Coral Reef Studies, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Natl Ctr Ecol Anal & Synth, Santa Barbara, CA 93101 USA","Madin, JS (reprint author), James Cook Univ N Queensland, Sch Marine & Trop Biol, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia.",madin@nceas.ucsb.edu,"Connolly, Sean/E-7773-2011","Connolly, Sean/0000-0003-1537-0859; Madin, Joshua/0000-0002-5005-6227",,,,24,122,127,6,80,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,23-Nov,2006,444,7118,,,,,477,480,,10.1038/nature05328,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,108BQ,WOS:000242215700044,17122855,No,,,11/20/17

A previous study in mice indicates that it might be possible to generate embryonic stem (ES) cells using a single-cell biopsy similar to that used in preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD), which does not interfere with the embryo's developmental potential(5). By growing the single blastomere overnight, the resulting cells could be used for both genetic testing and stem cell derivation without affecting the clinical outcome of the procedure. Here we report a series of ten separate experiments demonstrating that hES cells can be derived from single blastomeres. In this proof-of-principle study, multiple biopsies were taken from each embryo using micromanipulation techniques and none of the biopsied embryos were allowed to develop in culture. Nineteen ES-cell-like outgrowths and two stable hES cell lines were obtained. The latter hES cell lines maintained undifferentiated proliferation for more than eight months, and showed normal karyotype and expression of markers of pluri-potency, including Oct-4, SSEA-3, SSEA-4, TRA-1-60, TRA-1-81, nanog and alkaline phosphatase.

Neurosteroids are synthesized de novo in the brain during stress(2), pregnancy(3) and after ethanol consumption(4), and disrupted steroid regulation of GABAergic transmission is strongly implicated in several debilitating conditions such as panic disorder, major depression, schizophrenia, alcohol dependence and catamenial epilepsy(3,5-8). Determining how neurosteroids interact with the GABA(A) receptor is a prerequisite for understanding their physiological and pathophysiological roles in the brain. Here we identify two discrete binding sites in the receptor's transmembrane domains that mediate the potentiating and direct activation effects of neurosteroids. They potentiate GABA responses from a cavity formed by the alpha-subunit transmembrane domains, whereas direct receptor activation is initiated by interfacial residues between alpha and beta subunits and is enhanced by steroid binding to the potentiation site. Thus, significant receptor activation by neurosteroids relies on occupancy of both the activation and potentiation sites. These sites are highly conserved throughout the GABA(A) receptor family, and their identification provides a unique opportunity for the development of new therapeutic, neurosteroid-based ligands and transgenic disease models of neurosteroid dysfunction.","UCL, Dept Pharmacol, London WC1E 6BT, England","Hosie, AM (reprint author), UCL, Dept Pharmacol, Gower St, London WC1E 6BT, England.",alastair.hosie@ucl.ac.uk; t.smart@ucl.ac.uk,,,Medical Research Council [G0601529]; Wellcome Trust,,,28,380,394,1,36,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,23-Nov,2006,444,7118,,,,,486,489,,10.1038/nature05324,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,108BQ,WOS:000242215700046,17108970,No,,,11/20/17

A key mechanism to prevent inbreeding is self-incompatibility through rejection of incompatible ('self') pollen(1). In Papaver rhoeas, S proteins encoded by the stigma interact with incompatible pollen, triggering a Ca2+-dependent signalling network(2-5) resulting in pollen tube inhibition and programmed cell death(6). The cytosolic phosphoprotein p26.1, which has been identified in incompatible pollen, shows rapid, self-incompatibility-induced Ca2+-dependent hyperphosphorylation in vivo(3). Here we show that p26.1 comprises two proteins, Pr-p26.1a and Pr-p26.1b, which are soluble inorganic pyrophosphatases (sPPases). These proteins have classic Mg2+-dependent sPPase activity, which is inhibited by Ca2+, and unexpectedly can be phosphorylated in vitro. We show that phosphorylation inhibits sPPase activity, establishing a previously unknown mechanism for regulating eukaryotic sPPases. Reduced sPPase activity is predicted to result in the inhibition of many biosynthetic pathways, suggesting that there may be additional mechanisms of self-incompatibility-mediated pollen tube inhibition. We provide evidence that sPPases are required for growth and that self-incompatibility results in an increase in inorganic pyrophosphate, implying a functional role for Pr-p26.1.","Univ Birmingham, Sch Biosci, Birmingham B15 2TT, W Midlands, England","Franklin-Tong, VE (reprint author), Univ Birmingham, Sch Biosci, Birmingham B15 2TT, W Midlands, England.",v.e.franklin-tong@bham.ac.uk,"de Graaf, Barend H./A-5880-2010; Franklin-Tong, Vernonica/D-1287-2012","Franklin, F.

An essential element of cell cycle control is exerted by altering the expression of key regulators(3). Here we show an important function for the polo kinase Cdc5p in controlling cell-cycle-dependent gene expression that is crucial for the execution of mitosis in the model eukaryote Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In particular, we find that Cdc5p is temporally recruited to promoters of the cell-cycle-regulated CLB2 gene cluster, where it targets the Mcm1p-Fkh2p-Ndd1p transcription factor complex, through direct phosphorylation of the coactivator protein Ndd1p. This phosphorylation event is required for the normal temporal expression of cell-cycle-regulated genes such as CLB2 and SWI5 in G2/M phases. Furthermore, severe defects in cell division occur in the absence of Cdc5p-mediated phosphorylation of Ndd1p. Thus, polo kinase is required for the production of key mitotic regulators, in addition to previously defined roles in controlling other mitotic events.","Univ Manchester, Fac Life Sci, Manchester M13 9PT, Lancs, England; Univ Newcastle Upon Tyne, Fac Med Sci, Inst Cell & Mol Biosci, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE2 4HH, Tyne & Wear, England; Natl Inst Med Res, Div Yeast Genet, London NW7 1AA, England","Morgan, BA (reprint author), Univ Manchester, Fac Life Sci, Michael Smith Bldg,Oxford Rd, Manchester M13 9PT, Lancs, England.",b.a.morgan@ncl.ac.uk; a.d.sharrocks@man.ac.uk,,,"Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council [BBS/B/02509]; Medical Research Council [MC_U117531949]; Wellcome Trust [, 078085]",,,30,44,45,0,10,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,23-Nov,2006,444,7118,,,,,494,498,,10.1038/nature05339,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,108BQ,WOS:000242215700048,17122856,No,,,11/20/17

One major obstacle is the lack of experimentally validated training sets. In this study, we made use of extreme evolutionary sequence conservation as a filter to identify putative gene regulatory elements, and characterized the in vivo enhancer activity of a large group of non-coding elements in the human genome that are conserved in human-pufferfish, Takifugu (Fugu) rubripes, or ultra-conserved(1) in human-mouse-rat. Wetested 167 of these extremely conserved sequences in a transgenic mouse enhancer assay. Here we report that 45% of these sequences functioned reproducibly as tissue-specific enhancers of gene expression at embryonic day 11.5. While directing expression in a broad range of anatomical structures in the embryo, the majority of the 75 enhancers directed expression to various regions of the developing nervous system. We identified sequence signatures enriched in a subset of these elements that targeted forebrain expression, and used these features to rank all 3,100 non-coding elements in the human genome that are conserved between human and Fugu. The testing of the top predictions in transgenic mice resulted in a threefold enrichment for sequences with forebrain enhancer activity. These data dramatically expand the catalogue of human gene enhancers that have been characterized in vivo, and illustrate the utility of such training sets for a variety of biological applications, including decoding the regulatory vocabulary of the human genome.","US DOE, Joint Genome Inst, Walnut Creek, CA 94598 USA; Univ Calif Berkeley, Lawrence Berkeley Lab, Genom Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mol & Cellular Biol, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; Univ Calif San Francisco, Cardiovasc Res Inst, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA","Pennacchio, LA (reprint author), US DOE, Joint Genome Inst, Walnut Creek, CA 94598 USA.",LAPennacchio@lbl.gov,"Visel, Axel/A-9398-2009; Couronne, Olivier Couronne/G-1244-2012","Visel, Axel/0000-0002-4130-7784; Black, Brian/0000-0002-6664-8913; Eisen, Michael/0000-0002-7528-738X; Ahituv, Nadav/0000-0002-7434-8144",,,,29,671,693,3,42,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,23-Nov,2006,444,7118,,,,,499,502,,10.1038/nature05295,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,108BQ,WOS:000242215700049,17086198,No,,,11/20/17

This assembly delivers the ribosome-nascent chain complex to the protein translocation machinery in the membrane. Using cryo-electron microscopy and single-particle reconstruction, we obtained a 16 angstrom structure of the Escherichia coli SRP in complex with a translating E. coli ribosome containing a nascent chain with a transmembrane helix anchor. We also obtained structural information on the SRP bound to an empty E. coli ribosome.

In these organisms, lifespan extension is dependent on Sir2, a conserved deacetylase proposed to underlie the beneficial effects of caloric restriction. Here we show that resveratrol shifts the physiology of middle- aged mice on a high- calorie diet towards that of mice on a standard diet and significantly increases their survival. Resveratrol produces changes associated with longer lifespan, including increased insulin sensitivity, reduced insulin- like growth factor- 1 ( IGF- I) levels, increased AMP- activated protein kinase ( AMPK) and peroxisome proliferator- activated receptor-gamma coactivator 1 alpha ( PGC- 1 alpha) activity, increased mitochondrial number, and improved motor function. Parametric analysis of gene set enrichment revealed that resveratrol opposed the effects of the high- calorie diet in 144 out of 153 significantly altered pathways.

Those around black holes convert 5 - 40 per cent of restmass energy to radiation. Like water circling a drain, inflowing mass must lose angular momentum, presumably by vigorous turbulence in disks, which are essentially inviscid(1). The origin of the turbulence is unclear. Hot disks of electrically conducting plasma can become turbulent by way of the linear magnetorotational instability(2). Cool disks, such as the planet- forming disks of protostars, may be too poorly ionized for the magnetorotational instability to occur, and therefore essentially unmagnetized and linearly stable. Nonlinear hydrodynamic instability often occurs in linearly stable flows ( for example, pipe flows) at sufficiently large Reynolds numbers. Although planet- forming disks have extreme Reynolds numbers, keplerian rotation enhances their linear hydrodynamic stability, so the question of whether they can be turbulent and thereby transport angular momentum effectively is controversial(3-15). Here we report a laboratory experiment, demonstrating that non- magnetic quasi- keplerian flows at Reynolds numbers up to millions are essentially steady. Scaled to accretion disks, rates of angular momentum transport lie far below astrophysical requirements. By ruling out purely hydrodynamic turbulence, our results indirectly support the magnetorotational instability as the likely cause of turbulence, even in cool disks.","Princeton Univ, Ctr Magnet Self Org Lab & Astrophys Plasmas, Plasma Phys Lab, Princeton, NJ 08543 USA; Princeton Univ, Dept Astrophys Sci, Princeton, NJ 08543 USA","Ji, HT (reprint author), Princeton Univ, Ctr Magnet Self Org Lab & Astrophys Plasmas, Plasma Phys Lab, Princeton, NJ 08543 USA.",hji@pppl.gov,,,,,,32,139,139,0,16,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,16-Nov,2006,444,7117,,,,,343,346,,10.1038/nature05323,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,105GL,WOS:000242018300042,17108959,No,,,11/20/17

Such asymmetric electronic states for the different spins have been predicted for some ferromagnetic metals - for example, the Heusler compounds(1) and were first observed in a manganese perovskite (2). In view of the potential for use of this property in realizing spin- based electronics, substantial efforts have been made to search for half-metallic materials(3,4). However, organic materials have hardly been investigated in this context even though carbon- based nanostructures hold significant promise for future electronic devices (5). Here we predict half- metallicity in nanometre- scale graphene ribbons by using first- principles calculations. We show that this phenomenon is realizable if in- plane homogeneous electric fields are applied across the zigzag- shaped edges of the graphene nanoribbons, and that their magnetic properties can be controlled by the external electric fields.

But so far only limited experimental data on the intermolecular dispersion of electronic states in molecular materials is available (5 - 8), and the mechanism( s) of electron delocalization in molecular materials are also not well understood. Here we report scanning tunnelling spectroscopy observations of an organic monolayer film on a silver substrate, revealing a completely delocalized two- dimensional band state that is characterized by a metal- like parabolic dispersion with an effective mass of m* = 0.47m(e), where m(e) is the bare electron mass.

During low sea- level stands, slides and dense, sediment- laden flows erode the outer continental shelf and the continental slope, leading to the formation of submarine canyons that funnel large volumes of sediment and organic matter from shallow regions to the deep ocean (1). During high sea-level stands, such as at present, these canyons still experience occasional sediment gravity flows(2 - 5), which are usually thought to be triggered by sediment failure or river flooding. Here we present observations from a submarine canyon on the Gulf of Lions margin, in the northwest Mediterranean Sea, that demonstrate that these flows can also be triggered by dense shelf water cascading ( DSWC) - a type of current that is driven solely by seawater density contrast. Our results show that DSWC can transport large amounts of water and sediment, reshape submarine canyon floors and rapidly affect the deep- sea environment. This cascading is seasonal, resulting from the formation of dense water by cooling and/ or evaporation, and occurs on both high- and low- latitude continental margins(6 - 8). DSWC may therefore transport large amounts of sediment and organic matter to the deep ocean. Furthermore, changes in the frequency and intensity of DSWC driven by future climate change may have a significant impact on the supply of organic matter to deep- sea ecosystems and on the amount of carbon stored on continental margins and in ocean basins.","Univ Barcelona, Dept Stratig Paleontol & Marine Geosci, CRG Marine Geosci, E-08028 Barcelona, Spain; CSIC, Inst Marine Sci, E-08003 Barcelona, Spain; Univ Perpignan, CEFREM, CNRS, UMR 5110, F-66860 Perpignan, France","Canals, M (reprint author), Univ Barcelona, Dept Stratig Paleontol & Marine Geosci, CRG Marine Geosci, E-08028 Barcelona, Spain.",miquelcanals@ub.edu,"Puig, Pere/E-5422-2013; Canals, Miquel /F-4922-2013; Palanques, Albert/C-2661-2013","Puig, Pere/0000-0001-6189-5504; Canals, Miquel /0000-0001-5267-7601; ",,,,27,387,393,3,93,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,16-Nov,2006,444,7117,,,,,354,357,,10.1038/nature05271,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,105GL,WOS:000242018300045,17108962,No,,,11/20/17

Stress concentrations resulting from slip at such discontinuities may slow or stop rupture propagation and hence play a controlling role in limiting the length of earthquake rupture (2). Here I examine the mapped surface rupture traces of 22 historical strike- slip earthquakes with rupture lengths ranging between 10 and 420 km. I show that about two- thirds of the endpoints of strike- slip earthquake ruptures are associated with fault steps or the termini of active fault traces, and that there exists a limiting dimension of fault step ( 3 - 4 km) above which earthquake ruptures do not propagate and below which rupture propagation ceases only about 40 per cent of the time. The results are of practical importance to seismic hazard analysis where effort is spent attempting to place limits on the probable length of future earthquakes on mapped active faults. Physical insight to the dynamics of the earthquake rupture process is further gained with the observation that the limiting dimension appears to be largely independent of the earthquake rupture length. It follows that the magnitude of stress changes and the volume affected by those stress changes at the driving edge of laterally propagating ruptures are largely similar and invariable during the rupture process regardless of the distance an event has propagated or will propagate.","Univ Nevada, Ctr Neotecton Studies, Reno, NV 89557 USA","Wesnousky, SG (reprint author), Univ Nevada, Ctr Neotecton Studies, Mail Stop 169, Reno, NV 89557 USA.",stevew@seismo.unr.edu,,,,,,20,211,216,3,34,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,16-Nov,2006,444,7117,,,,,358,360,,10.1038/nature05275,,3,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,105GL,WOS:000242018300046,17108963,No,,,11/20/17

A prime example is the invasion of the gypsy moth in the United States, for which more than $ 194 million was spent on management and monitoring between 1985 and 2004 alone (3). The spread of the gypsy moth across eastern North America is, perhaps, the most thoroughly studied biological invasion in the world, providing a unique opportunity to explore spatiotemporal variability in rates of spread. Here we describe evidence for periodic pulsed invasions, defined as regularly punctuated range expansions interspersed among periods of range stasis. We use a theoretical model with parameter values estimated from long- term monitoring data to show how an interaction between strong Allee effects ( negative population growth at low densities) (4) and stratified diffusion ( most individuals disperse locally, but a few seed new colonies by long- range movement)(5) can explain the invasion pulses.

Understanding pluripotency at the molecular level should illuminate fundamental properties of stem cells and the process of cellular reprogramming. Through cell fusion the embryonic cell phenotype can be imposed on somatic cells, a process promoted by the homeodomain protein Nanog(5), which is central to the maintenance of ES cell pluripotency(6,7). Nanog is thought to function in concert with other factors such as Oct4 ( ref. 8) and Sox2 ( ref. 9) to establish ES cell identity. Here we explore the protein network in which Nanog operates in mouse ES cells. Using affinity purification of Nanog under native conditions followed by mass spectrometry, we have identified physically associated proteins. In an iterative fashion we also identified partners of several Nanog- associated proteins ( including Oct4), validated the functional relevance of selected newly identified components and constructed a protein interaction network. The network is highly enriched for nuclear factors that are individually critical for maintenance of the ES cell state and co- regulated on differentiation. The network is linked to multiple co- repressor pathways and is composed of numerous proteins whose encoding genes are putative direct transcriptional targets of its members. This tight protein network seems to function as a cellular module dedicated to pluripotency.","Childrens Hosp, Div Hematol Oncol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dana Farber Canc Inst, Harvard Stem Cell Inst, Boston, MA 02115 USA; Howard Hughes Med Inst, Boston, MA 02115 USA","Orkin, SH (reprint author), Childrens Hosp, Div Hematol Oncol, Boston, MA 02115 USA.",stuart_orkin@dfci.harvard.edu,,"Theunissen, Thorold/0000-0001-6943-7858",,,,28,683,714,6,68,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,16-Nov,2006,444,7117,,,,,364,368,,10.1038/nature05284,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,105GL,WOS:000242018300048,17093407,No,,,11/20/17

However, the receptor( s) responsible for Shh attraction remain unknown.

Boc is expressed by commissural neurons, and targeted disruption of Boc in mouse results in the misguidance of commissural axons towards the floor plate. RNA- interference-mediated knockdown of Boc impairs the ability of rat commissural axons to turn towards an ectopic source of Shh in vitro.

One way in which the brain keeps track of self- movement is by monitoring an internal copy, or corollary discharge, of motor commands(1 - 13). This concept could explain why we perceive a stable visual world despite our frequent quick, or saccadic, eye movements: corollary discharge about each saccade would permit the visual system to ignore saccade- induced visual changes(6 - 9). The critical missing link has been the connection between corollary discharge and visual processing. Here we show that such a link is formed by a corollary discharge from the thalamus that targets the frontal cortex. In the thalamus, neurons in the mediodorsal nucleus relay a corollary discharge of saccades from the midbrain superior colliculus to the cortical frontal eye field(10 - 12). In the frontal eye field, neurons use corollary discharge to shift their visual receptive fields spatially before saccades(14,15). We tested the hypothesis that these two components - a pathway for corollary discharge and neurons with shifting receptive fields - form a circuit in which the corollary discharge drives the shift. First we showed that the known spatial and temporal properties of the corollary discharge predict the dynamic changes in spatial visual processing of cortical neurons when saccades are made. Then we moved from this correlation to causation by isolating single cortical neurons and showing that their spatial visual processing is impaired when corollary discharge from the thalamus is interrupted. Thus the visual processing of frontal neurons is spatiotemporally matched with, and functionally dependent on, corollary discharge input from the thalamus. These experiments establish the first link between corollary discharge and visual processing, delineate a brain circuit that is well suited for mediating visual stability, and provide a framework for studying corollary discharge in other sensory systems.","Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Neurosci, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA; Univ Pittsburgh, Ctr Neural Basis Cognit, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA; Univ Pittsburgh, Ctr Neurosci, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA; NEI, Sensorimotor Res Lab, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA","Sommer, MA (reprint author), Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Neurosci, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA.",sommer@bns.pitt.edu,,,Intramural NIH HHS,,,23,254,255,0,16,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,16-Nov,2006,444,7117,,,,,374,377,,10.1038/nature05279,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,105GL,WOS:000242018300050,17093408,No,,,11/20/17

Human and avian influenza A viruses differ in their recognition of host cell receptors: the former preferentially recognize receptors with saccharides terminating in sialic acid-alpha 2,6-galactose ( SA alpha 2,6Gal), whereas the latter prefer those ending in SA alpha 2,3Gal ( refs 3 - 6). A conversion from SA alpha 2,3Gal to SA alpha 2,6Gal recognition is thought to be one of the changes that must occur before avian influenza viruses can replicate efficiently in humans and acquire the potential to cause a pandemic. By identifying mutations in the receptor- binding haemagglutinin ( HA) molecule that would enable avian H5N1 viruses to recognize human- type host cell receptors, it may be possible to predict ( and thus to increase preparedness for) the emergence of pandemic viruses. Here we show that some H5N1 viruses isolated from humans can bind to both human and avian receptors, in contrast to those isolated from chickens and ducks, which recognize the avian receptors exclusively. Mutations at positions 182 and 192 independently convert the HAs of H5N1 viruses known to recognize the avian receptor to ones that recognize the human receptor. Analysis of the crystal structure of the HA from an H5N1 virus used in our genetic experiments shows that the locations of these amino acids in the HA molecule are compatible with an effect on receptor binding. The amino acid changes that we identify might serve as molecular markers for assessing the pandemic potential of H5N1 field isolates.","Univ Tokyo, Dept Microbiol & Immunol, Div Virol, Tokyo 1088639, Japan; Univ Tokyo, Inst Med Sci, Int Res Ctr Infect Dis, Tokyo 1088639, Japan; Japan Sci & Technol Agcy, Core Res Evolut Sci & Technol, Kawaguchi, Saitama 3320012, Japan; Chubu Univ, Coll Life & Hlth Sci, Aichi 4878501, Japan; Univ Shizuoka, Sch Pharmaceut Sci, Dept Biochem, Shizuoka 4228526, Japan; COE Program 21st Century, Shizuoka 4228526, Japan; Natl Inst Hyg & Epidemiol, Hanoi, Vietnam; Airlangga Univ, Trop Dis Ctr, Avian Influenza Lab, Surabaya, Indonesia; Tottori Univ, Avian Zoonosis Res Ctr, Tottori 6808553, Japan; Gifu Univ, United Grad Sch Agr Sci, Dept Appl Bioorgan Chem, Gifu 5011193, Japan; Univ Shizuoka, Dept Appl Biol Chem, Shizuoka 4228529, Japan; MRC, Natl Inst Med Res, London NW7 1AA, England; Univ Wisconsin, Dept Pathobiol Sci, Madison, WI 53706 USA","Kawaoka, Y (reprint author), Univ Tokyo, Dept Microbiol & Immunol, Div Virol, Tokyo 1088639, Japan.",kawaoka@ims.u-tokyo.ac.jp,,"Gamblin, Steven/0000-0001-5331-639X","Medical Research Council [G0600522, MC_U117512708, MC_U117512711]; Wellcome Trust",,,26,392,429,4,64,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,16-Nov,2006,444,7117,,,,,378,382,,10.1038/nature05264,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,105GL,WOS:000242018300051,17108965,No,,,11/20/17

Site- directed mutagenesis(2 - 4) and brownian dynamics simulations(5 - 7) have suggested that the rate of association can be modulated by perturbations in charge distribution outside the direct interaction surfaces. Furthermore, rate enhancement through non- specific binding may occur by either a reduction in dimensionality(8) or the presence of a short- range, non- specific attractive potential(9). Here, using paramagnetic relaxation enhancement, we directly demonstrate the existence and visualize the distribution of an ensemble of transient, non- specific encounter complexes under equilibrium conditions for a relatively weak protein - protein complex between the amino- terminal domain of enzyme I and the phosphocarrier protein HPr. Neither the stereospecific complex(10) alone nor any single alternative conformation can account fully for the intermolecular paramagnetic relaxation enhancement data. Restrained rigid- body simulated annealing refinement against the paramagnetic relaxation enhancement data enables us to obtain an atomic probability distribution map of the non- specific encounter complex ensemble that qualitatively correlates with the electrostatic surface potentials on the interacting proteins.

The bacterial nucleoid consists of hundreds of DNA loops, shaped in part by non- specific DNA bridging proteins such as histone-like nucleoid structuring protein ( H- NS), leucine- responsive regulatory protein ( Lrp) and SMC ( structural maintenance of chromosomes) proteins(2,3). We have developed an optical tweezers instrument that can independently handle two DNA molecules, which allows the systematic investigation of protein- mediated DNA - DNA interactions. Here we use this technique to investigate the abundant non- specific nucleoid- associated protein H- NS, and show that H- NS is dynamically organized between two DNA molecules in register with their helical pitch. Our optical tweezers also allow us to carry out dynamic force spectroscopy on non- specific DNA binding proteins and thereby to determine an energy landscape for the H- NS - DNA interaction. Our results explain how the bacterial nucleoid can be effectively compacted and organized, but be dynamic in nature and accessible to DNA- tracking motor enzymes.

The translation of functionally active protein requires the messenger RNA to be positioned on the ribosome such that the start/ initiation codon will be read first and in the correct frame. Little is known about the molecular basis for the interaction of mRNA with the ribosome at different states of translation. Recent crystal structures of the ribosomal subunits(4 - 8), the empty 70S ribosome(9) and the 70S ribosome containing functional ligands(10 - 13) have provided information about the general organization of the ribosome and its functional centres. Here we compare the X- ray structures of eight ribosome complexes modelling the translation initiation, post- initiation and elongation states. In the initiation and post- initiation complexes, the presence of the Shine - Dalgarno ( SD) duplex causes strong anchoring of the 5' end of mRNA onto the platform of the 30S subunit, with numerous interactions between mRNA and the ribosome. Conversely, the 5' end of the ' elongator' mRNA lacking SD interactions is flexible, suggesting a different exit path for mRNA during elongation.

However, elastic models of the Indo - Asian collision using recently imaged subsurface interface geometries suggest that a substantial fraction of the southernmost 500 kilometres of the Tibetan plateau participates in driving great ruptures. We show here that this Tibetan reservoir of elastic strain energy is drained in proportion to Himalayan rupture length, and that the consequent growth of slip and magnitude with rupture area, when compared to data from recent earthquakes, can be used to infer a similar to 500-year renewal time for these events. The elastic models also illuminate two puzzling features of plate boundary seismicity: how great earthquakes can re-rupture regions that have already ruptured in recent smaller earthquakes and how mega-earthquakes with greater than 20 metres slip may occur at millennia-long intervals, driven by residual strain following many centuries of smaller earthquakes.","Univ Colorado, CIRES, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; Univ Colorado, Dept Geol Sci, Boulder, CO 80309 USA","Bilham, R (reprint author), Univ Colorado, CIRES, Boulder, CO 80309 USA.",bilham@colorado.edu,,"Bilham, Roger/0000-0002-5547-4102",,,,42,93,100,1,30,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,9-Nov,2006,444,7116,,,,,165,170,,10.1038/nature05199,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,103DZ,WOS:000241867200032,17093444,No,,,11/20/17

Here we show that in the unicellular eukaryote Paramecium tetraurelia, a ciliate, most of the nearly 40,000 genes arose through at least three successive whole-genome duplications. Phylogenetic analysis indicates that the most recent duplication coincides with an explosion of speciation events that gave rise to the P. aurelia complex of 15 sibling species. We observed that gene loss occurs over a long timescale, not as an initial massive event. Genes from the same metabolic pathway or protein complex have common patterns of gene loss, and highly expressed genes are over-retained after all duplications. The conclusion of this analysis is that many genes are maintained after whole-genome duplication not because of functional innovation but because of gene dosage constraints.","Genoscope, F-91057 Evry, France; CNRS, UMR 8030, F-91057 Evry, France; Univ Lyon 1, CNRS, Lab Biometrie & Biol Evolut, UMR 5558, F-69622 Villeurbanne, France; CNRS, Ctr Genet Mol, F-91198 Gif Sur Yvette, France; Ecole Normale Super, Genet Mol Lab, CNRS, UMR 8541, F-75005 Paris, France; Univ Pompeu Fabra, Ctr Genom Regulat, Inst Municipal Invest Med, Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain; Univ Konstanz, Dept Biol, D-78457 Constance, Germany; Polish Acad Sci, Inst Biochem & Biophys, DNA Sequencing Lab, PL-02106 Warsaw, Poland; Inst Gustave Roussy, Lab Genomes & Canc, FRE 2939, CNRS, F-94805 Villejuif, France","Wincker, P (reprint author), Genoscope, 2 Rue Gaston Cremieux,CP5706, F-91057 Evry, France.",pwincker@genoscope.cns.fr,"Sperling, Linda/C-9734-2014; Nowacki, Mariusz/E-4485-2011; Camara Ferreira, Francisco/G-9841-2015; Guigo, Roderic/D-1303-2010","Nowacki, Mariusz/0000-0003-4894-2905; Camara Ferreira, Francisco/0000-0002-1971-5466; Meyer, Eric/0000-0002-3161-8597; Guigo, Roderic/0000-0002-5738-4477; Duret, Laurent/0000-0003-2836-3463; Daubin, Vincent/0000-0001-8269-9430; AURY, Jean-Marc/0000-0003-1718-3010; lepere, gersende/0000-0002-4609-7587; ARNAIZ, Olivier/0000-0002-9626-1015; Sperling, Linda/0000-0002-7772-4774",,,,48,445,513,2,64,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,9-Nov,2006,444,7116,,,,,171,178,,10.1038/nature05230,,8,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,103DZ,WOS:000241867200033,17086204,No,,,11/20/17

Rhomboid proteases, like site-2 protease (S2P) and gamma-secretase, are unique in that they cleave the transmembrane domain of other membrane proteins. Here we describe the 2.1 angstrom resolution crystal structure of the GlpG core domain. This structure contains six transmembrane segments. Residues previously shown to be involved in catalysis, including a Ser-His dyad, and several water molecules are found at the protein interior at a depth below the membrane surface. This putative active site is accessible by substrate through a large 'V-shaped' opening that faces laterally towards the lipid, but is blocked by a half-submerged loop structure. These observations indicate that, in intramembrane proteolysis, the scission of peptide bonds takes place within the hydrophobic environment of the membrane bilayer. The crystal structure also suggests a gating mechanism for GlpG that controls substrate access to its hydrophilic active site.","Yale Univ, Sch Med, Dept Pharmacol, New Haven, CT 06520 USA","Ha, Y (reprint author), Yale Univ, Sch Med, Dept Pharmacol, 333 Cedar St, New Haven, CT 06520 USA.",ya.ha@yale.edu,,,,,,49,210,218,0,28,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,9-Nov,2006,444,7116,,,,,179,183,,10.1038/nature05255,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,103DZ,WOS:000241867200034,17051161,No,,,11/20/17

Crater statistics and degradation models indicate that last-gasp eruptions of thin basalt flows continued until less than 1.0 Gyr ago(1), but the Moon is now considered to be unaffected by internal processes today, other than weak tidally driven moonquakes(2) and young fault systems(3). It is therefore widely assumed that only impact craters have reshaped the lunar landscape over the past billion years. Here we report that patches of the lunar regolith in the Ina structure(2-5) were recently removed. The preservation state of relief, the number of superimposed small craters, and the 'freshness' ( spectral maturity) of the regolith together indicate that features within this structure must be as young as 10 Myr, and perhaps are still forming today. We propose that these features result from recent, episodic out-gassing from deep within the Moon. Such out-gassing probably contributed to the radiogenic gases detected during past lunar missions. Future monitoring ( including Earth-based observations) should reveal the composition of the gas, yielding important clues to volatiles archived at great depth over the past 4 - 4.5 Gyr.","Brown Univ, Providence, RI 02912 USA; Planetary Sci Inst, Tucson, AZ 85719 USA","Schultz, PH (reprint author), Brown Univ, Providence, RI 02912 USA.",peter_schultz@brown.edu,,,,,,29,33,33,1,10,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,9-Nov,2006,444,7116,,,,,184,186,,10.1038/nature05303,,3,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,103DZ,WOS:000241867200035,17093445,No,,,11/20/17

This result closely resembles the well-known quantization of electrical conductance in ballistic one-imensional conductors(2,3). Interestingly, all particles - irrespective of whether they are bosons or fermions - have the same quantized thermal conductance(4,5) when they are confined within dimensions that are small compared to their characteristic wavelength. The single-mode heat conductance is particularly relevant in nanostructures. Quantized heat transport through submicrometre dielectric wires by phonons has been observed(6), and it has been predicted to influence cooling of electrons in metals at very low temperatures due to electromagnetic radiation(7). Here we report experimental results showing that at low temperatures heat is transferred by photon radiation, when electron - phonon(8) as well as normal electronic heat conduction is frozen out. We study heat exchange between two small pieces of normal metal, connected to each other only via superconducting leads, which are ideal insulators against conventional thermal conduction. Each superconducting lead is interrupted by a switch of electromagnetic ( photon) radiation in the form of a DC-SQUID ( a superconducting loop with two Josephson tunnel junctions). We find that the thermal conductance between the two metal islands mediated by photons indeed approaches the expected quantum limit of GQ at low temperatures. Our observation has practical implications - for example, for the performance and design of ultra-sensitive bolometers ( detectors of far-infrared light) and electronic micro-refrigerators(9), whose operation is largely dependent on weak thermal coupling between the device and its environment.","Helsinki Univ Technol, Low Temp Lab, Helsinki 02015, Finland; Univ Grenoble 1, F-38042 Grenoble 9, France; LCMI CNRS, F-38042 Grenoble 9, France","Pekola, JP (reprint author), Helsinki Univ Technol, Low Temp Lab, POB 3500, Helsinki 02015, Finland.",jukka.pekola@tkk.fi,"Meschke, Matthias/G-5166-2012; Pekola, Jukka/A-4211-2013",,,,,20,136,138,2,61,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,9-Nov,2006,444,7116,,,,,187,190,,10.1038/nature05276,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,103DZ,WOS:000241867200036,17093446,No,,,11/20/17

Such monolayers generally consist of amphiphilic surfactants anchored by their polar headgroups; sliding occurs at the interface between the layers, greatly reducing friction and especially wear of the underlying substrates. This process, widespread in engineering applications, is also predicted to occur in biological lubrication via phospholipid films(8,9), though few systematic studies on friction between surfactant layers in aqueous environments have been carried out(5,10). Here we show that the frictional stress between two sliding surfaces bearing surfactant monolayers may decrease, when immersed in water, to as little as one per cent or less of its value in air ( or oil). We attribute this to the shift of the slip plane from between the surfactant layers, to the surfactant/ substrate interface. The low friction would then be due to the fluid hydration layers surrounding the polar head groups attached to the substrate. These results may have implications for future technological and biomedical applications.","Univ Oxford, Phys & Theoret Chem Lab, Oxford OX1 3QZ, England; Weizmann Inst Sci, IL-76100 Rehovot, Israel","Klein, J (reprint author), Univ Oxford, Phys & Theoret Chem Lab, S Parks Rd, Oxford OX1 3QZ, England.",jacob.klein@chem.ox.ac.uk,"McGillivray, Duncan/B-9819-2009","McGillivray, Duncan/0000-0003-2127-8792; Briscoe, Wuge/0000-0001-8025-960X",,,,28,163,165,12,161,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,9-Nov,2006,444,7116,,,,,191,194,,10.1038/nature05196,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,103DZ,WOS:000241867200037,17093447,No,,,11/20/17

For the last glacial period, ice core studies(1,2) have revealed strong coupling of the largest millennial-scale warm events in Antarctica with the longest Dansgaard - Oeschger events in Greenland(3-5) through the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation(6-8). It has been unclear, however, whether the shorter Dansgaard - Oeschger events have counterparts in the shorter and less prominent Antarctic temperature variations, and whether these events are linked by the same mechanism. Here we present a glacial climate record derived from an ice core from Dronning Maud Land, Antarctica, which represents South Atlantic climate at a resolution comparable with the Greenland ice core records. After methane synchronization with an ice core from North Greenland(9), the oxygen isotope record from the Dronning Maud Land ice core shows a one-to-one coupling between all Antarctic warm events and Greenland Dansgaard - Oeschger events by the bipolar seesaw(6). The amplitude of the Antarctic warm events is found to be linearly dependent on the duration of the concurrent stadial in the North, suggesting that they all result from a similar reduction in the meridional overturning circulation.","Univ Ca Foscari, Dept Environm Sci, Venice, Italy; CNR, Inst Dynam Environm Proc, I-30123 Venice, Italy; CNRS UJF, Lab Glaciol & Geophys Environm, F-38402 St Martin Dheres, France; Univ Florence, Dept Chem, I-50019 Florence, Italy; EAWAG, CH-8600 Dubendorf, Switzerland; Univ Bern, Inst Phys, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland; Univ Copenhagen, Niels Bohr Inst, DK-2100 Copenhagen OE, Denmark; CE Saclay, Lab Sci Climat & Environm LSCE IPSL, CEA CNRS UVSQ, F-91191 Gif Sur Yvette, France; Univ Milano Bicocca, Dept Environm Sci, I-20126 Milan, Italy; Alfred Wegener Inst Polar & Marine Res, D-27568 Bremerhaven, Germany; Alfred Wegener Inst Polar & Marine Res, Res Unit Potsdam, D-14473 Potsdam, Germany; GSF, Natl Ctr Environm & Hlth, D-85764 Neuherberg, Germany; UCL, London WC1E 6BT, England; Stockholm Univ, Dept Phys Geog & Quaternary Geol, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden; British Antarctic Survey, Cambridge CB3 0ET, England; Univ Libre Brussels, Dept Geog, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium; Norwegian Polar Res Inst, N-9296 Tromso, Norway; ENEA, I-00060 Rome, Italy; Univ Utrecht, Inst Marine & Atmospher Res, NL-3508 TA Utrecht, Netherlands; CSNSM IN2P3 CNRS, F-91405 Orsay, France; Univ Trieste, Dept Geol Environm & Marine Sci, I-34127 Trieste, Italy; Univ Libre Brussels, Dept Sci Terre, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium; Heidelberg Univ, Inst Environm Phys, D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany; Max Planck Inst Math Sci, D-04103 Leipzig, Germany","Fischer, H (reprint author), Univ Ca Foscari, Dept Environm Sci, Venice, Italy.",hufischer@awi-bremerhaven.de,"Schmitt, Jochen/B-7893-2009; Fundel, Felix/C-5469-2009; Chappellaz, Jerome/A-4872-2011; Oerlemans, Johannes/G-3802-2011; Karlin, Torbjorn/H-7839-2012; Masson-Delmotte, Valerie/G-1995-2011; van de wal, roderik/D-1705-2011; Mulvaney, Robert/K-3929-2012; Van den Broeke, Michiel/F-7867-2011; Fischer, Hubertus/A-1211-2014; Faria, Sergio Henrique/K-9454-2013; Stocker, Thomas/B-1273-2013; Rybak, Oleg/B-7308-2014; Wolff, Eric/D-7925-2014; Maggi, Valter/E-1878-2014; Parrenin, Frederic/H-3054-2014; Lambert, Fabrice/M-2003-2014; Blunier, Thomas/M-4609-2014; Weikusat, Ilka/E-8826-2015; Delmonte, Barbara/L-2555-2015; Traversi, Rita/M-7586-2015; Udisti, Roberto/M-7966-2015; Raynaud, Dominique/H-9626-2016; Severi, Mirko/J-2508-2012; Leuenberger, Markus/K-9655-2016; Dahl-Jensen, Dorthe/N-4401-2016; Debret, Maxime/L-4236-2017; Meyer, Hanno/E-2870-2016","Schmitt, Jochen/0000-0003-4695-3029; Karlin, Torbjorn/0000-0003-1479-801X; Masson-Delmotte, Valerie/0000-0001-8296-381X; Mulvaney, Robert/0000-0002-5372-8148; Van den Broeke, Michiel/0000-0003-4662-7565; Fischer, Hubertus/0000-0002-2787-4221; Faria, Sergio Henrique/0000-0002-8825-7518; Rybak, Oleg/0000-0003-3923-7163; Wolff, Eric/0000-0002-5914-8531; Parrenin, Frederic/0000-0002-9489-3991; Lambert, Fabrice/0000-0002-2192-024X; Blunier, Thomas/0000-0002-6065-7747; Weikusat, Ilka/0000-0002-3023-6036; Traversi, Rita/0000-0002-9790-2195; Udisti, Roberto/0000-0003-4440-8238; Severi, Mirko/0000-0003-1511-6762; Leuenberger, Markus/0000-0003-4299-6793; Dahl-Jensen, Dorthe/0000-0002-1474-1948; Debret, Maxime/0000-0002-8852-0152; Becagli, Silvia/0000-0003-3633-4849; Meyer, Hanno/0000-0003-4129-4706; Delmonte, Barbara/0000-0002-9074-2061; Tison, Jean-Louis/0000-0002-9758-3454; Fritzsche, Diedrich/0000-0002-0018-8993; Steffensen, Jorgen Peder/0000-0002-5516-1093; Wilhelms, Frank/0000-0001-7688-3135",,,,30,642,655,15,175,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,9-Nov,2006,444,7116,,,,,195,198,,10.1038/nature05301,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,103DZ,WOS:000241867200038,,No,,,11/20/17

Here we present new observations from the most complete, acid-prepared Devonian tetrapodomorph fish yet discovered, Gogonasus(1,2), which was previously placed just crownward of Kenichthys and rhizodontids(3,4), the most primitive taxa on the tetrapod lineage. Unexpectedly, Gogonasus shows a mosaic of plesiomorphic and derived tetrapod-like features. Whereas the braincase and dermal cranial skeleton exhibit generalized morphologies with respect to Eusthenopteron(5) or Panderichthys(6), taxa that are traditionally considered to be phyletically close to tetrapods(7,8), the presence of a deeply invaginated, wide spiracle, advanced internal spiracular architecture and near-horizontal hyomandibula are specialized features that are absent from Eusthenopteron(9). Furthermore, the pectoral fin skeleton of Gogonasus shares several features with that of Tiktaalik, the most tetrapod-like fish(10). A new phylogenetic analysis places Gogonasus crownward of Eusthenopteron as the sister taxon to the Elpistostegalia.

Repair of such damage by cell transplantation is one of the most feasible types of central nervous system repair; photoreceptor degeneration initially leaves the inner retinal circuitry intact and new photoreceptors need only make single, short synaptic connections to contribute to the retinotopic map. So far, brain- and retina-derived stem cells transplanted into adult retina have shown little evidence of being able to integrate into the outer nuclear layer and differentiate into new photoreceptors(1-4). Furthermore, there has been no demonstration that transplanted cells form functional synaptic connections with other neurons in the recipient retina or restore visual function. This might be because the mature mammalian retina lacks the ability to accept and incorporate stem cells or to promote photoreceptor differentiation. We hypothesized that committed progenitor or precursor cells at later ontogenetic stages might have a higher probability of success upon transplantation. Here we show that donor cells can integrate into the adult or degenerating retina if they are taken from the developing retina at a time coincident with the peak of rod genesis(5). These transplanted cells integrate, differentiate into rod photoreceptors, form synaptic connections and improve visual function. Furthermore, we use genetically tagged postmitotic rod precursors expressing the transcription factor Nrl (ref. 6) ( neural retina leucine zipper) to show that successfully integrated rod photoreceptors are derived only from immature post-mitotic rod precursors and not from proliferating progenitor or stem cells. These findings define the ontogenetic stage of donor cells for successful rod photoreceptor transplantation.","UCL, Dev Biol Unit, Inst Child Hlth, London WC1N 1EH, England; UCL, Inst Ophthalmol, Div Mol Therapy, London EC1V 9EL, England; Moorfields Eye Hosp, Vitreretinal Serv, London EC1V 2PD, England; City Univ London, Henry Wellcome Lab Vis Sci, Dept Optometry & Visual Sci, London EC1V 0HB, England; Univ Michigan, Dept Ophthalmol & Visual Sci, Ann Arbor, MI 48105 USA; Univ Michigan, Dept Human Genet, Ann Arbor, MI 48105 USA; UCL, Mol Immunol Unit, Inst Child Hlth, London WC1N 1EH, England","Swaroop, A (reprint author), UCL, Dev Biol Unit, Inst Child Hlth, 30 Guilford St, London WC1N 1EH, England.",swaroop@umich.edu; r.ali@ucl.ac.uk,"Salt, Thomas/A-6405-2009","Pearson, Rachael/0000-0002-1107-1969; MacLaren, Robert/0000-0002-3096-4682; Swaroop, Anand/0000-0002-1975-1141","Medical Research Council [G0300341, G0601588]",,,29,603,631,4,77,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,9-Nov,2006,444,7116,,,,,203,207,,10.1038/nature05161,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,103DZ,WOS:000241867200040,17093405,No,,,11/20/17

Molecules accounting for lethal effects of venoms have been extensively characterized, but less is known about the mechanisms by which they produce pain. Venoms from spiders, snakes, cone snails or scorpions contain a pharmacopoeia of peptide toxins that block receptor or channel activation as a means of producing shock, paralysis or death(3-5). We examined whether these venoms also contain toxins that activate ( rather than inhibit) excitatory channels on somatosensory neurons to produce a noxious sensation in mammals. Here we show that venom from a tarantula that is native to the West Indies contains three inhibitor cysteine knot (ICK) peptides that target the capsaicin receptor (TRPV1), an excitatory channel expressed by sensory neurons of the pain pathway(6). In contrast with the predominant role of ICK toxins as channel inhibitors(5,7), these previously unknown 'vanillotoxins' function as TRPV1 agonists, providing new tools for understanding mechanisms of TRP channel gating. Some vanillotoxins also inhibit voltage-gated potassium channels, supporting potential similarities between TRP and voltage-gated channel structures. TRP channels can now be included among the targets of peptide toxins, showing that animals, like plants ( for example, chilli peppers), avert predators by activating TRP channels on sensory nerve fibres to elicit pain and inflammation.","Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Cellular & Mol Pharmacol, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; Univ Calif Berkeley, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Mass Spectrometry Lab, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Physiol, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Anat, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Physiol, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; Univ Calif San Francisco, WM Keck Ctr Integrat Neurosci, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA","Julius, D (reprint author), Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Cellular & Mol Pharmacol, 600 16th St, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA.",julius@cmp.ucsf.edu,"Piskorowski, Rebecca/G-6610-2017","Piskorowski, Rebecca/0000-0003-0120-2360","NIAMS NIH HHS [R01 AR051219, R01 AR051219-03]",,,30,176,185,4,47,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,9-Nov,2006,444,7116,,,,,208,212,,10.1038/nature05285,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,103DZ,WOS:000241867200041,17093448,No,,,11/20/17

Central to the complement system is the activated form of C3, called C3b, which attaches covalently to target surfaces(3) to amplify complement response, label cells for phagocytosis and stimulate the adaptive immune response. C3b consists of 1,560 amino-acid residues and has 12 domains. It binds various proteins and receptors to effect its functions(4). However, it is not known how C3 changes its conformation into C3b and thereby exposes its many binding sites. Here we present the crystal structure at 4-angstrom resolution of the activated complement protein C3b and describe the conformational rearrangements of the 12 domains that take place upon proteolytic activation. In the activated form the thioester is fully exposed for covalent attachment to target surfaces and is more than 85 angstrom away from the buried site in native C3 (ref. 5). Marked domain rearrangements in the alpha-chain present an altered molecular surface, exposing hidden and cryptic sites that are consistent with known putative binding sites of factor B and several complement regulators. The structural data indicate that the large conformational changes in the proteolytic activation and regulation of C3 take place mainly in the first conversion step, from C3 to C3b. These insights are important for the development of strategies to treat immune disorders that involve complement-mediated inflammation.","Univ Utrecht, Bijvoet Ctr Biomol Res, Fac Sci, NL-3584 CH Utrecht, Netherlands; Univ Penn, Sch Med, Dept Pathol & Lab Med, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; European Mol Biol Lab, Grenoble Outstn, F-38042 Grenoble, France","Gros, P (reprint author), Univ Utrecht, Bijvoet Ctr Biomol Res, Fac Sci, Padualaan 8, NL-3584 CH Utrecht, Netherlands.",p.gros@chem.uu.nl,"Janssen, Bert/I-3338-2016; Gros, Piet/I-5569-2016","Janssen, Bert/0000-0002-8101-8370; Gros, Piet/0000-0002-7782-2585; Lambris, John/0000-0002-9370-5776",,,,30,206,212,0,18,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,9-Nov,2006,444,7116,,,,,213,216,,10.1038/nature05172,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,103DZ,WOS:000241867200042,17051160,No,,,11/20/17

After exposure to pathogens, the third component of the complement system, C3, is cleaved to C3b which, after recruitment of factor B, initiates formation of the alternative pathway convertases(2-4). CRIg, a complement receptor expressed on macrophages, binds to C3b and iC3b mediating phagocytosis of the particles 5, but it is unknown how CRIg selectively recognizes proteolytic C3-fragments and whether binding of CRIg to C3b inhibits convertase activation. Here we present the crystal structure of C3b in complex with CRIg and, using CRIg mutants, provide evidence that CRIg acts as an inhibitor of the alternative pathway of complement. The structure shows that activation of C3 induces major structural rearrangements, including a dramatic movement (>80 angstrom) of the thioester-bond-containing domain through which C3b attaches to pathogen surfaces. We show that CRIg is not only a phagocytic receptor, but also a potent inhibitor of the alternative pathway convertases. The structure provides insights into the complex macromolecular structural rearrangements that occur during complement activation and inhibition.

Complement-derived products mediate functions contributing to pathogen killing and elimination(1). However, inappropriate activation of the system contributes to the pathogenesis of immunological and inflammatory diseases(1). Complement component 3 (C3) occupies a central position because of the manifold biological activities of its activation fragments, including the major fragment, C3b, which anchors the assembly of convertases effecting C3 and C5 activation. C3 is converted to C3b by proteolysis of its anaphylatoxin domain(2), by either of two C3 convertases. This activates a stable thioester bond, leading to the covalent attachment of C3b to cell-surface or protein-surface hydroxyl groups through transesterification(3). The cleavage and activation of C3 exposes binding sites for factors B, H and I, properdin, decay accelerating factor (DAF, CD55), membrane cofactor protein (MCP, CD46), complement receptor 1 (CR1, CD35) and viral molecules such as vaccinia virus complement-control protein(4). C3b associates with these molecules in different configurations and forms complexes mediating the activation, amplification and regulation of the complement response(1,4). Structures of C3 and C3c, a fragment derived from the proteolysis of C3b, have revealed a domain configuration, including six macroglobulin domains (MG1 - MG6; nomenclature follows ref. 5) arranged in a ring, termed the beta-ring(5). However, because neither C3 nor C3c is active in complement activation and regulation, questions about function can be answered only through direct observations on C3b. Here we present a structure of C3b that reveals a marked loss of secondary structure in the CUB ( for 'complement C1r/C1s, Uegf, Bmp1') domain, which together with the resulting translocation of the thioester domain provides a molecular basis for conformational changes accompanying the conversion of C3 to C3b. The total conformational changes make many proposed ligand-binding sites more accessible and create a cavity that shields target peptide bonds from access by factor I. A covalently bound N-acetyl-L-threonine residue demonstrates the geometry of C3b attachment to surface hydroxyl groups.","Univ Alabama Birmingham, Ctr Biophys Sci & Engn, Birmingham, AL 35294 USA; Univ Alabama Birmingham, Dept Med, Birmingham, AL 35294 USA; Univ Cape Town, HSC, Div Med Virol, Inst Infect Dis & Mol Med, ZA-7925 Cape Town, South Africa","Murthy, HMK (reprint author), Univ Alabama Birmingham, Ctr Biophys Sci & Engn, 1530 3rd Ave S, Birmingham, AL 35294 USA.",murthy@cbse.uab.edu,,,,,,30,43,44,2,12,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,9-Nov,2006,444,7116,,,,,221,225,,10.1038/nature05258,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,103DZ,WOS:000241867200044,,No,,,11/20/17

Abnormal RTK/ERK signalling has been extensively documented to contribute to developmental disorders and disease, most notably in oncogenic transformation by mutant RTKs(1) or downstream pathway components such as Ras and Raf(2). Although the core RTK/ERK signalling cassette has been characterized by decades of research using mammalian cell culture and forward genetic screens in model organisms, signal propagation through this pathway is probably regulated by a larger network of moderate, context-specific proteins. The genes encoding these proteins may not have been discovered through traditional screens owing, in particular, to the requirement for visible phenotypes. To obtain a global view of RTK/ERK signalling, we performed an unbiased, RNA interference (RNAi), genome-wide, high-throughput screen in Drosophila cells using a novel, quantitative, cellular assay monitoring ERK activation. Here we show that ERK pathway output integrates a wide array of conserved cellular processes. Further analysis of selected components - in multiple cell types with different RTK ligands and oncogenic stimuli - validates and classifies 331 pathway regulators. The relevance of these genes is highlighted by our isolation of a Ste20-like kinase and a PPM-family phosphatase that seem to regulate RTK/ERK signalling in vivo and in mammalian cells. Novel regulators that modulate specific pathway outputs may be selective targets for drug discovery.","Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Dept Genet, Boston, MA 02115 USA","Perrimon, N (reprint author), Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Dept Genet, 77 Ave Louis Pasteur, Boston, MA 02115 USA.",perrimon@receptor.med.harvard.edu,,"Perrimon, Norbert/0000-0001-7542-472X",,,,30,151,154,2,16,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,9-Nov,2006,444,7116,,,,,230,234,,10.1038/nature05280,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,103DZ,WOS:000241867200046,17086199,No,,,11/20/17

Proterozoic glacial deposits laid down in near-equatorial palaeomagnetic latitudes can be explained by 'snowball Earth' episodes, high orbital obliquity or markedly non-uniformitarian geomagnetic fields. Here I present a global palaeomagnetic compilation of the Earth's entire basin-scale evaporite record. Magnetic inclinations are consistent with low orbital obliquity and a geocentric-axial-dipole magnetic field for most of the past two billion years, and the snowball Earth hypothesis accordingly remains the most viable model for low-latitude Proterozoic ice ages.

Here we show that stable reorganization of motor output can be induced by an artificial connection between two sites in the motor cortex of freely behaving primates. An autonomously operating electronic implant used action potentials recorded on one electrode to trigger electrical stimuli delivered at another location. Over one or more days of continuous operation, the output evoked from the recording site shifted to resemble the output from the corresponding stimulation site, in a manner consistent with the potentiation of synaptic connections between the artificially synchronized populations of neurons. Changes persisted in some cases for more than one week, whereas the output from sites not incorporated in the connection was unaffected. This method for inducing functional reorganization in vivo by using physiologically derived stimulus trains may have practical application in neurorehabilitation after injury.","Univ Washington, Dept Physiol & Biophys, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; Univ Washington, Washington Natl Primate Res Ctr, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; Univ Washington, Dept Elect Engn, Seattle, WA 98195 USA","Fetz, EE (reprint author), Univ Washington, Dept Physiol & Biophys, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.",fetz@u.washington.edu,,"Jackson, Andrew/0000-0001-8701-6387",,,,34,228,234,5,32,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,2-Nov,2006,444,7115,,,,,56,60,,10.1038/nature05226,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,100WS,WOS:000241701500043,17057705,No,,,11/20/17

Studies suggest that retinoblastomas, which initiate with mutations in the gene retinoblastoma 1 ( RB1), bypass the p53 pathway because they arise from intrinsically death-resistant cells during retinal development. In contrast to this prevailing theory, here we show that the tumour surveillance pathway mediated by Arf, MDM2, MDMX and p53 is activated after loss of RB1 during retinogenesis. RB1-deficient retinoblasts undergo p53-mediated apoptosis and exit the cell cycle. Subsequently, amplification of the MDMX gene and increased expression of MDMX protein are strongly selected for during tumour progression as a mechanism to suppress the p53 response in RB1-deficient retinal cells. Our data provide evidence that the p53 pathway is inactivated in retinoblastoma and that this cancer does not originate from intrinsically death-resistant cells as previously thought. In addition, they support the idea that MDMX is a specific chemotherapeutic target for treating retinoblastoma.","St Jude Childrens Hosp, Dept Dev Neurobiol, Memphis, TN 38105 USA; St Jude Childrens Hosp, Dept Chem Biol & Therapeut, Memphis, TN 38105 USA; St Jude Childrens Hosp, Dept Pathol, Memphis, TN 38105 USA; St Jude Childrens Hosp, Dept Surg, Div Ophthalmol, Memphis, TN 38105 USA; St Jude Childrens Hosp, Dept Hematol Oncol, Memphis, TN 38105 USA; Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Mol & Cellular Pharmacol, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; Leiden Univ, Med Ctr, Dept Mol & Cell Biol, NL-2300 RC Leiden, Netherlands; Univ Tennessee, Ctr Hlth Sci, Dept Ophthalmol, Memphis, TN 38163 USA; FIRC Inst Mol Oncol, I-20139 Milan, Italy; Flanders Interuniv Biotechnol, Lab Mol Canc Biol, B-9052 Ghent, Belgium; Purdue Univ, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA","Dyer, MA (reprint author), St Jude Childrens Hosp, Dept Dev Neurobiol, 332 N Lauderdale St, Memphis, TN 38105 USA.",michael.dyer@stjude.org,"Francoz, Sarah/K-4328-2014; Guy, Rodney/J-7107-2013; Marine, Jean Christophe/J-2237-2015; Marine, Jean-Christophe/K-3292-2016","Francoz, Sarah/0000-0002-6589-4207; Guy, Rodney/0000-0002-9638-2060; Marine, Jean-Christophe/0000-0003-2433-9837",,,,36,382,395,1,24,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,2-Nov,2006,444,7115,,,,,61,66,,10.1038/nature05194,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,100WS,WOS:000241701500044,17080083,No,,,11/20/17

Here we report the observation of self-cooling of a micromirror by radiation pressure inside a high-finesse optical cavity. In essence, changes in intensity in a detuned cavity, as caused by the thermal vibration of the mirror, provide the mechanism for entropy flow from the mirror's oscillatory motion to the low-entropy cavity field(2). The crucial coupling between radiation and mechanical motion was made possible by producing freestanding micromirrors of low mass (m approximate to 400 ng), high reflectance ( more than 99.6%) and high mechanical quality (Q approximate to 10,000). We observe cooling of the mechanical oscillator by a factor of more than 30; that is, from room temperature to below 10 K. In addition to purely photothermal effects(7) we identify radiation pressure as a relevant mechanism responsible for the cooling. In contrast with earlier experiments, our technique does not need any active feedback(8-10). We expect that improvements of our method will permit cooling ratios beyond 1,000 and will thus possibly enable cooling all the way down to the quantum mechanical ground state of the micromirror.","Univ Vienna, Fac Phys, Inst Expt Phys, A-1090 Vienna, Austria; Austrian Acad Sci, IQOQI, A-1090 Vienna, Austria; Johannes Kepler Univ Linz, Inst Appl Phys, A-4040 Linz, Austria; Univ Maryland, Lab Phys Sci, College Pk, MD 20740 USA; Univ Maryland, Dept Phys, College Pk, MD 20740 USA","Aspelmeyer, M (reprint author), Univ Vienna, Fac Phys, Inst Expt Phys, Boltzmanngasse 5, A-1090 Vienna, Austria.",markus.aspelmeyer@quantum.at,"Paternostro, Mauro/E-3297-2010; Aspelmeyer, Markus/C-4098-2017","Paternostro, Mauro/0000-0001-8870-9134; Aspelmeyer, Markus/0000-0003-4499-7335; Gigan, Sylvain/0000-0002-9914-6231",,,,29,573,581,5,76,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,2-Nov,2006,444,7115,,,,,67,70,,10.1038/nature05273,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,100WS,WOS:000241701500045,17080084,No,,,11/20/17

Operation at higher powers will be crucial for further sensitivity enhancement, but dynamical effects caused by radiation pressure on the interferometer mirrors must be taken into account, and the appearance of optomechanical instabilities may jeopardize the stable operation of the next generation of interferometers(4-6). These instabilities(7,8) are the result of a nonlinear coupling between the motion of the mirrors and the optical field, which modifies the effective dynamics of the mirror. Such 'optical spring' effects have already been demonstrated for the mechanical damping of an electromagnetic waveguide with a moving wall(9), the resonance frequency of a specially designed flexure oscillator(10), and the optomechanical instability of a silica microtoroidal resonator(11). Here we present an experiment where amicromechanical resonator is used as a mirror in a very high-finesse optical cavity, and its displacements are monitored with unprecedented sensitivity. By detuning the laser frequency with respect to the cavity resonance, we have observed a drastic cooling of the microresonator by intracavity radiation pressure, down to an effective temperature of 10 kelvin. For opposite detuning, efficient heating is observed, as well as a radiation-pressure-induced instability of the resonator. Further experimental progress and cryogenic operation may lead to the experimental observation of the quantum ground state of a micromechanical resonator(12-14), either by passive(15) or active cooling techniques(16-18).","Univ Paris 06, Lab Kastler Brossel, F-75252 Paris 05, France","Cohadon, PF (reprint author), Univ Paris 06, Lab Kastler Brossel, Case 74,4 Pl Jussieu, F-75252 Paris 05, France.",cohadon@spectro.jussieu.fr,"Heidmann, Antoine/G-4295-2016","Heidmann, Antoine/0000-0002-0784-5175",,,,26,608,614,8,84,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,2-Nov,2006,444,7115,,,,,71,74,,10.1038/nature05244,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,100WS,WOS:000241701500046,17080085,No,,,11/20/17

This means that non-conventional methods of structure analysis must be applied to obtain the structural information that is fundamental to the understanding of the properties of these materials. Electron microscopy might appear to be a natural approach, but only relatively simple structures have been solved by this route. Powder diffraction is another obvious option, but the overlap of reflections with similar diffraction angles causes an ambiguity in the relative intensities of those reflections. Various ways of overcoming or circumventing this problem have been developed(1,2), and several of these involve incorporating chemical information into the structure determination process(3-7). For complex zeolite structures, the FOCUS algorithm(8,9) has proved to be effective. Because it operates in both real and reciprocal space, phase information obtained from high-resolution transmission electron microscopy images can be incorporated directly into this algorithm in a simple way. Here we show that by doing so, the complexity limit can be extended much further. The power of this approach has been demonstrated with the solution of the structure of the zeolite TNU-9 (\H-9.3\[ Al9.3Si182.7O384]; ref. 10) with 24 topologically distinct ( Si, Al) atoms and 52 such O atoms.

The relationships between invertebrate and vertebrate deuterostomes are clearly important for understanding our own distant origins. Recent phylogenetic studies of chordate classes and a sea urchin have indicated that urochordates might be the closest invertebrate sister group of vertebrates, rather than cephalochordates, as traditionally believed(2-5). More remarkable is the suggestion that cephalochordates are closer to echinoderms than to vertebrates and urochordates, meaning that chordates are paraphyletic(2). To study the relationships among all deuterostome groups, we have assembled an alignment of more than 35,000 homologous amino acids, including new data from a hemichordate, starfish and Xenoturbella. We have also sequenced the mitochondrial genome of Xenoturbella. We support the clades Olfactores ( urochordates and vertebrates) and Ambulacraria ( hemichordates and echinoderms(6)). Analyses using our new data, however, do not support a cephalochordate and echinoderm grouping and we conclude that chordates are monophyletic. Finally, nuclear and mitochondrial data place Xenoturbella as the sister group of the two ambulacrarian phyla(1).

Field studies of vertebrates suggest, and laboratory experiments on invertebrates confirm, that even when males provide no material benefits, polyandry can enhance offspring survival(2,3). This enhancement is widely attributed to genetic benefits that arise whenever paternity is biased towards males that sire more viable offspring(1,4,5). Field studies suggest that post-mating sexual selection biases fertilization towards genetically more compatible males(6,7) and one controlled experiment has shown that, when females mate with close kin, polyandry reduces the relative number of inbred offspring(8). Another potential genetic benefit of polyandry is that it increases offspring survival because males with more competitive ejaculates sire more viable offspring(9). Surprisingly, however, there is no unequivocal evidence for this process(10). Here, by experimentally assigning mates to females, we show that polyandry greatly increases offspring survival in the Australian marsupial Antechinus stuartii. DNA profiling shows that males that gain high paternity under sperm competition sire offspring that are more viable. This beneficial effect occurs in both the laboratory and the wild. Crucially, there are no confounding non-genetic maternal effects that could arise if polyandry increases female investment in a particular reproductive event(10) because A. stuartii is effectively semelparous. Our results therefore show that polyandry improves female lifetime fitness in nature. The threefold increase in offspring survival is not negated by a decline in maternal lifespan and is too large to be offset by an equivalent decline in the reproductive performance of surviving offspring.","Australian Natl Univ, Sch Bot & Zool, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia; Australian Natl Univ, Ctr Resource & Environm Studies, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia","Fisher, DO (reprint author), Australian Natl Univ, Sch Bot & Zool, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia.",diana.fisher@anu.edu.au,"Fisher, Diana/C-1324-2010; Jennions, Michael/C-7560-2009; Blomberg, Simon/B-7613-2008","Fisher, Diana/0000-0002-4017-3710; Jennions, Michael/0000-0001-9221-2788; Blomberg, Simon/0000-0003-1062-0839",,,,30,131,132,5,72,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,2-Nov,2006,444,7115,,,,,89,92,,10.1038/nature05206,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,100WS,WOS:000241701500051,17080089,No,,,11/20/17

The validity of these assumptions remains unclear, however, because previous tests have been limited in both geographical and taxonomic extent(5-12). Here we use a database on the global distribution of 19,349 living bird, mammal and amphibian species to show that, although the distribution of overall species richness is very similar among these groups, congruence in the distribution of rare and threatened species is markedly lower. Congruence is especially low among the very rarest species. Cross-taxon congruence is also highly scale dependent, being particularly low at the finer spatial resolutions relevant to real protected areas. 'Hotspots' of rarity and threat are therefore largely non-overlapping across groups, as are areas chosen to maximize species complementarity. Overall, our results indicate that 'silver-bullet' conservation strategies alone will not deliver efficient conservation solutions. Instead, priority areas for biodiversity conservation must be based on high-resolution data from multiple taxa.","Univ Virginia, Dept Biol, Charlottesville, VA 22904 USA; Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Div Biol, Ascot SL5 7PY, Berks, England; Univ Sheffield, Dept Anim & Plant Sci, Biodivers & Macroecol Grp, Sheffield S10 2TN, S Yorkshire, England; Univ Birmingham, Sch Biosci, Birmingham B15 2TT, W Midlands, England; Zool Soc London, Inst Zool, London NW1 4RY, England; Acad Nat Sci Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA 19103 USA; Michigan State Univ Museum, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; Dept Zool, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; Natl Taiwan Univ, Sch Forestry & Resource Conservat, Taipei 106, Taiwan; NERC, Ctr Populat Biol, Ascot SL5 7PY, Berks, England","Grenyer, R (reprint author), Royal Bot Gardens, Jodrell Lab, Richmond TW9 3AB, Surrey, England.",r.grenyer@kew.org; jlg@uga.edu; i.owens@imperial.ac.uk,"Owens, Ian/F-1392-2010; Jones, Kate/G-4768-2010; Blackburn, Tim/A-7685-2011","Jones, Kate/0000-0001-5231-3293; Owens, Ian/0000-0001-6080-3321; DING, Tzung-Su/0000-0002-1102-3879; Thomas, Gavin/0000-0002-1982-6051",,,,30,268,281,7,192,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,2-Nov,2006,444,7115,,,,,93,96,,10.1038/nature05237,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,100WS,WOS:000241701500052,17080090,No,,,11/20/17

This basidiomycete fungus does not use aggressive virulence strategies to kill its host. U. maydis belongs to the group of biotrophic parasites ( the smuts) that depend on living tissue for proliferation and development(2). Here we report the genome sequence for a member of this economically important group of biotrophic fungi. The 20.5-million-base U. maydis genome assembly contains 6,902 predicted protein-encoding genes and lacks pathogenicity signatures found in the genomes of aggressive pathogenic fungi, for example a battery of cell-wall-degrading enzymes. However, we detected unexpected genomic features responsible for the pathogenicity of this organism. Specifically, we found 12 clusters of genes encoding small secreted proteins with unknown function. A significant fraction of these genes exists in small gene families. Expression analysis showed that most of the genes contained in these clusters are regulated together and induced in infected tissue. Deletion of individual clusters altered the virulence of U. maydis in five cases, ranging from a complete lack of symptoms to hypervirulence. Despite years of research into the mechanism of pathogenicity in U. maydis, no 'true' virulence factors(3) had been previously identified. Thus, the discovery of the secreted protein gene clusters and the functional demonstration of their decisive role in the infection process illuminate previously unknown mechanisms of pathogenicity operating in biotrophic fungi. Genomic analysis is, similarly, likely to open up new avenues for the discovery of virulence determinants in other pathogens.","Max Planck Inst Terr Microbiol, Dept Organism Interact, D-35043 Marburg, Germany; Univ Marburg, Dept Biol, D-35032 Marburg, Germany; MIT, Broad Inst, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; Harvard Univ, Broad Inst, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; Univ Toronto, Dept Biol, Mississauga, ON L5L 1C6, Canada; Calif State Univ Long Beach, Dept Biol Sci, Long Beach, CA 90840 USA; Univ British Columbia, Michael Smith Labs, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada; Univ Georgia, Dept Plant Pathol, Athens, GA 30602 USA; Univ Louisville, Dept Biol, Program Dis Evolut, Louisville, KY 40292 USA; Univ Utrecht, Inst Biomembranes, Dept Microbiol, NL-3705 SN Utrecht, Netherlands; IPN, Ctr Invest & Estudios Avanzados, Dept Ingn Genet, Unidad Biotecnol & Ingn Genet Plantas, Irapuato 36500, Gto, Mexico; St Josephs Univ, Dept Biol, Philadelphia, PA 19131 USA; CSIC, Ctr Nacl Biotecnol, Dept Microbiol Biotechnol, E-28049 Madrid, Spain; Univ Pablo Olavide, CSIC, Ctr Andaluz Biol Desarrollo, Seville 41013, Spain; Cornell Univ, Weill Med Coll, Dept Microbiol & Immunol, New York, NY 10021 USA; CINVESTAV, Dept Plant Genet Engn, Guanajuato 36821, Mexico; Univ Kentucky, Dept Plant Pathol, Lexington, KY 40546 USA; Duke Univ, Dept Mol Genet & Microbiol, Durham, NC 27710 USA; Univ Valencia, Fac Farm, Dept Microbiol & Ecol, Valencia 46100, Spain; IPN, Ctr Biotecnol Genom, Dept Biotecnol Vegetal 2, Tamaulipas 88710, Mexico; St Louis Univ, Dept Biol, St Louis, MO 63103 USA; Univ Kentucky, Dept Biol, Lexington, KY 40546 USA; Bayer CropSci AG, D-40789 Monheim, Germany; LION Biosci AG, D-69123 Heidelberg, Germany; Exelixis Inc, San Francisco, CA 94080 USA; GSF NAtl Res Ctr Environm & Hlth, Inst Bioinformat MIPS, D-85764 Neuherberg, Germany; Tech Univ Munich, D-85354 Freising Weihenstephan, Germany","Kahmann, R (reprint author), Max Planck Inst Terr Microbiol, Dept Organism Interact, Karl von Frisch Str, D-35043 Marburg, Germany.",kaemper@mpi-marburg.mpg.de; kahmann@mpi-marburg.mpg.de; boelker@staff.uni-marburg.de,"; Stajich, Jason/C-7297-2008; Guzman, Plinio/A-3073-2012; Guldener, Ulrich/G-5227-2012; Mendoza Mendoza, Artemio/F-3519-2013; Perez-Martin, Jose/K-5117-2014; Molina, Lazaro/K-9645-2014; Reynaga Pena, Cristina /D-4803-2016; Ibeas, Jose/B-7615-2015","de Vries, Ronald/0000-0002-4363-1123; Reynaga-Pena, Cristina G./0000-0003-3039-551X; Wade, Claire/0000-0003-3413-4771; Galagan, James/0000-0003-0542-3291; Stajich, Jason/0000-0002-7591-0020; Guldener, Ulrich/0000-0001-5052-8610; Mendoza Mendoza, Artemio/0000-0002-1532-3406; Perez-Martin, Jose/0000-0001-9849-7382; Molina, Lazaro/0000-0002-8483-9203; Ibeas, Jose/0000-0002-2394-7075; Ma, Li-Jun/0000-0002-2733-3708; Boyce, Kylie/0000-0002-7167-5414; DeCaprio, Dave/0000-0001-8931-9461",,,,29,553,614,4,148,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,2-Nov,2006,444,7115,,,,,97,101,,10.1038/nature05248,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,100WS,WOS:000241701500053,17080091,No,,,11/20/17

The pore can either dilate fully so that the vesicle collapses completely, or close rapidly to generate 'kiss-and-run' fusion(1,2,4-7). The size of the pore determines the release rate(2). At synapses, the size of the fusion pore is unclear, 'kiss-and-run' remains controversial(8-15), and the ability of 'kiss-and-run' fusion to generate rapid synaptic currents(16,17) is questionable(18). Here, by recording fusion pore kinetics during single vesicle fusion, we found both full collapse and 'kiss-and-run' fusion at calyx-type synapses. For full collapse, the initial fusion pore conductance (G(p)) was usually > 375 pS and increased rapidly at >= 299 pS ms(-1). 'Kiss-and-run' fusion was seen as a brief capacitance flicker (< 2 s) with G(p) > 288 pS for most flickers, but within 15 - 288 pS for the remaining flickers. Large G(p) (> 288 pS) might discharge transmitter rapidly and thereby cause rapid synaptic currents, whereas small Gp might generate slow and small synaptic currents. These results show that 'kiss-and-run' fusion occurs at synapses and that it can generate rapid postsynaptic currents, and suggest that various fusion pore sizes help to control the kinetics and amplitude of synaptic currents.","NINDS, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA","Wu, LG (reprint author), NINDS, 35 Convent Dr,Bldg 35,Room 2B-1012, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA.",wul@ninds.nih.gov,,,Intramural NIH HHS,,,30,116,124,1,11,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,2-Nov,2006,444,7115,,,,,102,105,,10.1038/nature05250,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,100WS,WOS:000241701500054,17065984,No,,,11/20/17

Although these receptors span the cell membrane, they are not considered to be voltage sensitive. Recently it was shown that both the activity of GPCRs(2-5) and their affinity towards agonists(6) are regulated by membrane potential. However, it remains unclear whether GPCRs intrinsically respond to changes in membrane potential. Here we show that two prototypical GPCRs, the m2 and m1 muscarinic receptors (m2R and m1R), display charge-movement-associated currents analogous to 'gating currents' of voltage-gated channels. The gating charge - voltage relationship of m2R correlates well with the voltage dependence of the affinity of the receptor for acetylcholine. The loop that couples m2R and m1R to their G protein has a crucial function in coupling voltage sensing to agonist-binding affinity. Our data strongly indicate that GPCRs serve as sensors for both transmembrane potential and external chemical signals.","Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Dept Neurobiol, IL-91904 Jerusalem, Israel; Univ Wisconsin, Dept Physiol, Madison, WI 53706 USA; Tel Aviv Univ, Dept Physiol & Pharmacol, IL-69978 Tel Aviv, Israel; Univ Chicago, Inst Mol Pediat Sci, Chicago, IL 60637 USA","Parnas, H (reprint author), Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Dept Neurobiol, IL-91904 Jerusalem, Israel.",hannap@huji.ac.il,"Dascal, Nathan/O-3915-2015","Dascal, Nathan/0000-0002-5397-4146; Chanda, Baron/0000-0003-4954-7034",,,,30,95,96,0,14,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,2-Nov,2006,444,7115,,,,,106,109,,10.1038/nature05259,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,100WS,WOS:000241701500055,17065983,No,,,11/20/17

In humans, defects in immune homeostasis result in lymphoproliferation disorders including autoimmunity, haemophagocytic lymphohystiocytosis and lymphomas. The X-linked lymphoproliferative syndrome (XLP) is a rare, inherited immunodeficiency that is characterized by lymphohystiocytosis, hypogammaglobulinaemia and lymphomas, and that usually develops in response to infection with Epstein - Barr virus (EBV)(3-5). Mutations in the signalling lymphocyte activation molecule ( SLAM)- associated protein SAP, a signalling adaptor molecule, underlie 60% of cases of familial XLP6-8. Here, we identify mutations in the gene that encodes the X-linked inhibitor-of-apoptosis XIAP ( also termed BIRC4) in patients with XLP from three families without mutations in SAP. These mutations lead to defective expression of XIAP. We show that apoptosis of lymphocytes from XIAP-deficient patients is enhanced in response to various stimuli including the T-cell antigen receptor (TCR) - CD3 complex, the death receptor CD95 ( also termed Fas or Apo-1) and the TNF-associated apoptosis-inducing ligand receptor (TRAIL-R). We also found that XIAP-deficient patients, like SAP-deficient patients, have low numbers of natural killer T-lymphocytes (NKT cells)(9,10), indicating that XIAP is required for the survival and/or differentiation of NKT cells. The observation that XIAP-deficiency and SAP-deficiency are both associated with a defect in NKT cells strengthens the hypothesis that NKT cells have a key role in the immune response to EBV. Furthermore, by identifying an XLP immunodeficiency that is caused by mutations in XIAP, we show that XIAP is a potent regulator of lymphocyte homeostasis in vivo.","Univ Paris 05, INSERM, U768, Lab Dev Normal & Pathol Syst Immunitaire, F-75015 Paris, France; Hop Necker Enfants Malad, APHP, Ctr Etud Deficits Immunitaires, F-75015 Paris, France; Hop St Louis, APHP, Serv Immunohematol, F-75010 Paris, France; Hop Necker Enfants Malad, APHP, Unite Immunol Hematol Pediat, F-75015 Paris, France","Latour, S (reprint author), Univ Paris 05, INSERM, U768, Lab Dev Normal & Pathol Syst Immunitaire, F-75015 Paris, France.",latour@necker.fr,"Rieux-Laucat, Frederic/A-7916-2017; Mateo, Veronique/O-9738-2017","Rieux-Laucat, Frederic/0000-0001-7858-7866; Mateo, Veronique/0000-0002-9327-1277; de Saint Basile, Genevieve/0000-0002-1913-5269; Latour, Sylvain/0000-0001-8238-4391; Revy, Patrick/0000-0003-0758-8022",,,,21,352,369,1,13,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,2-Nov,2006,444,7115,,,,,110,114,,10.1038/nature05257,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,100WS,WOS:000241701500056,17080092,No,,,11/20/17

In response to microbial and inflammatory stimuli, dendritic cells enhance their capacity for antigen presentation by a process of terminal differentiation, termed maturation(2,3). The conversion of immature to mature dendritic cells is accompanied by a marked cellular reorganization, including the redistribution of major histocompatibility complex class II molecules (MHC II) from late endosomal and lysosomal compartments to the plasma membrane(4-7) and the downregulation of some forms of endocytosis, which has been thought to slow the clearance of MHC II from the surface(8-11). The relative extent to which these or other mechanisms contribute to the regulation of surface MHC II remains unclear, however. Here we find that the MHC II beta-chain cytoplasmic tail is ubiquitinated in mouse immature dendritic cells. Although only partly required for the sequestration of MHC II in multivesicular bodies, this modification is essential for endocytosis. Notably, ubiquitination of MHC II ceased upon maturation, resulting in the accumulation of MHC II at the cell surface. Dendritic cells thus exhibit a unique ability to regulate MHC II surface expression by selectively controlling MHC II ubiquitination.","Yale Univ, Sch Med, Dept Cell Biol, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; Yale Univ, Sch Med, Ludwig Inst Canc Res, Immunobiol Sect, New Haven, CT 06520 USA","Mellman, I (reprint author), Yale Univ, Sch Med, Dept Cell Biol, 333 Cedar St,POB 208002, New Haven, CT 06520 USA.",ira.mellman@yale.edu,,,,,,29,159,179,0,15,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,2-Nov,2006,444,7115,,,,,115,118,,10.1038/nature05261,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,100WS,WOS:000241701500057,17051151,No,,,11/20/17

Here we use a metagenomic approach to describe four co-occurring symbionts from the marine oligochaete Olavius algarvensis, a worm lacking a mouth, gut and nephridia. Shotgun sequencing and metabolic pathway reconstruction revealed that the symbionts are sulphur-oxidizing and sulphate-reducing bacteria, all of which are capable of carbon fixation, thus providing the host with multiple sources of nutrition. Molecular evidence for the uptake and recycling of wormwaste products by the symbionts suggests how the worm could eliminate its excretory system, an adaptation unique among annelid worms. We propose a model that describes how the versatile metabolism within this symbiotic consortium provides the host with an optimal energy supply as it shuttles between the upper oxic and lower anoxic coastal sediments that it inhabits.","Max Planck Inst Marine Microbiol, D-28359 Bremen, Germany; DOE Joint Genome Inst, Walnut Creek, CA 94598 USA; Univ Calif Berkeley, Lawrence Berkeley Lab, Genom Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; Int Jacobs Univ Bremen, D-28759 Bremen, Germany","Rubin, EM (reprint author), Max Planck Inst Marine Microbiol, D-28359 Bremen, Germany.",EMRubin@lbl.gov; ndubilie@mpi-bremen.de,"Amann, Rudolf/C-6534-2014; Mussmann, Marc/A-8649-2017; Kyrpides, Nikos/A-6305-2014","Amann, Rudolf/0000-0002-0846-7372; Mussmann, Marc/0000-0003-3102-8703; Kyrpides, Nikos/0000-0002-6131-0462; Ivanova, Natalia/0000-0002-5802-9485; Dubilier, Nicole/0000-0002-9394-825X; Barry, Kerrie/0000-0002-8999-6785",,,,39,247,258,13,94,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,26-Oct,2006,443,7114,,,,,950,955,,10.1038/nature05192,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,098LZ,WOS:000241523400045,16980956,No,,,11/20/17

However, it remains unclear how the correct nucleotide triphosphate is selected in each reaction step and how the polymerization is driven by the protein and RNA dynamics. Here we present complete sequential snapshots of six complex structures of CCA-adding enzyme and four distinct RNA substrates with and without CTP ( cytosine triphosphate) or ATP ( adenosine triphosphate). The CCA-lacking RNA stem extends by one base pair to force the discriminator nucleoside into the active-site pocket, and then tracks back after incorporation of the first cytosine monophosphate (CMP). Accommodation of the second CTP clamps the catalytic cleft, inducing a reorientation of the beta-turn, which flips C74 to allow CMP to be accepted. In contrast, after the second CMP is added, the polymerase and RNA primer are locked in the closed state, which directs the subsequent A addition. Between the CTP- and ATP-binding stages, the side-chain conformation of Arg 224 changes markedly; this is controlled by the global motion of the enzyme and position of the primer terminus, and is likely to achieve the CTP/ATP discrimination, depending on the polymerization stage. Throughout the CCA-adding reaction, the enzyme tail domain firmly anchors the TYC-loop of the tRNA, which ensures accurate polymerization and termination.","Natl Inst Adv Ind Sci & Technol, Inst Biol Resources & Funct, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058565, Japan; Tokyo Inst Technol, Grad Sch Biosci & Biotechnol, Dept Biol Informat, Kanagawa 2258501, Japan; JST, SORST, Kawaguchi, Saitama 3320012, Japan","Tomita, K (reprint author), Natl Inst Adv Ind Sci & Technol, Inst Biol Resources & Funct, 1-1-1 Higashi, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058565, Japan.",kozo-tomita@aist.go.jp; nureki@bio.titech.ac.jp,"Tomita, Kozo/J-5746-2013",,,,,23,47,47,1,6,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,26-Oct,2006,443,7114,,,,,956,960,,10.1038/nature05204,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,098LZ,WOS:000241523400046,17051158,No,,,11/20/17

By using cold atomic gases, various models of condensed matter can be studied in a highly controllable environment. Weakly repulsive fermions in an optical lattice could undergo d-wave pairing(1) at low temperatures, a possible mechanism for high temperature superconductivity in the copper oxides(2). The lattice potential could also strongly increase the critical temperature for s-wave superfluidity. Recent experimental advances in bulk atomic gases include the observation of fermion-pair condensates and high-temperature superfluidity(3-8). Experiments with fermions(9-11) and bosonic bound pairs(12,13) in optical lattices have been reported but have not yet addressed superfluid behaviour. Here we report the observation of distinct interference peaks when a condensate of fermionic atom pairs is released from an optical lattice, implying long-range order ( a property of a superfluid). Conceptually, this means that s-wave pairing and coherence of fermion pairs have now been established in a lattice potential, in which the transport of atoms occurs by quantum mechanical tunnelling and not by simple propagation. These observations were made for interactions on both sides of a Feshbach resonance. For larger lattice depths, the coherence was lost in a reversible manner, possibly as a result of a transition from superfluid to insulator. Such strongly interacting fermions in an optical lattice can be used to study a new class of hamiltonians with interband and atom - molecule couplings(14).","MIT, Dept Phys, MIT Harvard Ctr Ultracold Atom, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; MIT, Elect Res Lab, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA","Chin, JK (reprint author), MIT, Dept Phys, MIT Harvard Ctr Ultracold Atom, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",jitkee@mit.edu,,,,,,30,279,282,2,26,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,26-Oct,2006,443,7114,,,,,961,964,,10.1038/nature05224,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,098LZ,WOS:000241523400047,17066028,No,,,11/20/17

An important feature of these materials is the phenomenon of adsorption hysteresis: for certain ranges of applied pressure, the amount of a molecular species adsorbed by the mesoporous host is higher on desorption than on adsorption, indicating a failure of the system to equilibrate. Although this phenomenon has been known for over a century, the underlying internal dynamics responsible for the hysteresis remain poorly understood(5-9). Here we present a combined experimental and theoretical study in which microscopic and macroscopic aspects of the relaxation dynamics associated with hysteresis are quantified by direct measurement and computer simulations of molecular models. Using nuclear magnetic resonance techniques(10-14) and Vycor porous glass(15,16) as a model mesoporous system, we have explored the relationship between molecular self-diffusion and global uptake dynamics. For states outside the hysteresis region, the relaxation process is found to be essentially diffusive in character; within the hysteresis region, the dynamics slow down dramatically and, at long times, are dominated by activated rearrangement of the adsorbate density within the host material.","Univ Leipzig, Fak Phys & Geowissensch, Abt Granzflachenphys, D-04103 Leipzig, Germany; Univ Nevada, Dept Chem, Reno, NV 89557 USA; Univ Massachusetts, Dept Chem Engn, Amherst, MA 01003 USA","Valiullin, R (reprint author), Univ Leipzig, Fak Phys & Geowissensch, Abt Granzflachenphys, D-04103 Leipzig, Germany.",valiullin@uni-leipzig.de,"Valiullin, Rustem/F-6432-2011; Monson, Peter/G-5662-2017","Monson, Peter/0000-0002-7458-3443",,,,30,159,159,1,57,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,26-Oct,2006,443,7114,,,,,965,968,,10.1038/nature05183,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,098LZ,WOS:000241523400048,17066029,No,,,11/20/17

The most continuous record of sea surface temperatures of that time has been derived from variations in oxygen isotope ratios of cherts (siliceous sediments)(2), but the long-term cooling of the oceans inferred from those data(3-5) has been questioned because the oxygen isotope signature could have been reset through the exchange with hydrothermal fluids after deposition of the sediments(6). Here we show that the silicon isotopic composition of cherts more than 550 million years old shows systematic variations with age that support the earlier conclusion of long-term ocean cooling and exclude post-depositional exchange as the main source of the isotopic variations. In agreement with other lines of evidence(1,7), a model of the silicon cycle in the Precambrian era shows that the observed silicon isotope variations imply seawater temperature changes from about 70 degrees C 3,500 million years ago to about 20 degrees C 800 million years ago.","Museum Natl Hist Nat, CNRS, LEME Nanoanal, UMS 2679, F-75005 Paris, France; Ctr Rech Petrog & Geochim, CRPG, CNRS, F-54501 Vandoeuvre Les Nancy, France","Robert, F (reprint author), Museum Natl Hist Nat, CNRS, LEME Nanoanal, UMS 2679, 57 Rue Cuvier, F-75005 Paris, France.",robert@mnhn.fr; chocho@crpg.cnrs-nancy.fr,"Chaussidon, Marc/E-7067-2017",,,,,30,176,190,3,50,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,26-Oct,2006,443,7114,,,,,969,972,,10.1038/nature05239,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,098LZ,WOS:000241523400049,17066030,No,,,11/20/17

But because hydrogen can be incorporated in olivine at mantle pressures(3-5), this observation has been attributed to olivine hydration, which might cause anisotropically high conductivity by proton migration(1,2,6,7). To examine this hypothesis, here we report the effect of water on electrical conductivity and its anisotropy for hydrogen-doped and undoped olivine at 500 - 1,500 K and 3 GPa. The hydrous olivine has much higher conductivity and lower activation energy than anhydrous olivine in the investigated temperature range. Nevertheless, extrapolation of the experimental results suggests that conductivity of hydrous olivine at the top of the asthenosphere should be nearly isotropic and only of the order of 10(-2) Sm(-1).

Estimating the water content of the Earth's mantle by direct sampling provides only a limited data set from shallow regions (<200 km depth)(5). Geophysical observations such as electrical conductivity are considered to be sensitive to water content(6), but there has been no experimental study to determine the effect of water on the electrical conductivity of olivine, the most abundant mineral in the Earth's mantle. Here we report a laboratory study of the dependence of the electrical conductivity of olivine aggregates on water content at high temperature and pressure. The electrical conductivity of synthetic polycrystalline olivine was determined from a. c. impedance measurements at a pressure of 4 GPa for a temperature range of 873 - 1,273K for water contents of 0.01 - 0.08 wt%. The results show that the electrical conductivity is strongly dependent on water content but depends only modestly on temperature. The water content dependence of conductivity is best explained by a model in which electrical conduction is due to the motion of free protons.

In contrast to the rich fossil record of armoured jawless fishes, all of which date from the Devonian period and earlier(1-3), only two Palaeozoic lampreys have been recorded, both from the Carboniferous period(1). In addition to these, the recent report of an exquisitely preserved Lower Cretaceous example(4) demonstrates that anatomically modern lampreys were present by the late Mesozoic era. Here we report a marine/ estuarine fossil lamprey from the Famennian ( Late Devonian) of South Africa(5,6), the identity of which is established easily because many of the key specializations of modern forms are already in place. These specializations include the first evidence of a large oral disc, the first direct evidence of circumoral teeth and a well preserved branchial basket. This small agnathan, Priscomyzon riniensis gen. et sp. nov., is not only more conventionally lamprey-like than other Palaeozoic examples(7,8), but is also some 35 million years older. This finding is evidence that agnathans close to modern lampreys had evolved before the end of the Devonian period. In this light, lampreys as a whole appear all the more remarkable: ancient specialists that have persisted as such and survived a subsequent 360 million years.","Univ Witwatersrand, Sch Geosci, Bernard Price Inst Palaeontol, ZA-2050 Johannesburg, South Africa; Univ Chicago, Dept Organismal Biol, Chicago, IL 60637 USA","Gess, RW (reprint author), Univ Witwatersrand, Sch Geosci, Bernard Price Inst Palaeontol, ZA-2050 Johannesburg, South Africa.",robg@imaginet.co.za,,"Rubidge, Bruce/0000-0003-2477-1873",,,,28,113,119,0,23,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,26-Oct,2006,443,7114,,,,,981,984,,10.1038/nature05150,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,098LZ,WOS:000241523400052,17066033,No,,,11/20/17

Here, we use a set of partial deletions to show that only the last four Hox paralogy groups can elicit this response: that is, precisely those genes whose expression is excluded from most anterior limb bud cells owing to their collinear transcriptional activation. We propose that the limb A - P polarity is produced as a collateral effect of Hox gene collinearity, a process highly constrained by its crucial importance during trunk development. In this view, the co-option of the trunk collinear mechanism, along with the emergence of limbs, imposed an A - P polarity to these structures as the most parsimonious solution.

So far, the generality of patterns and processes observed in individual studies have been the subjects of considerable debate(3-7). Here we present a formal meta-analysis of studies that have experimentally manipulated species diversity to examine how it affects the functioning of numerous trophic groups in multiple types of ecosystem. We show that the average effect of decreasing species richness is to decrease the abundance or biomass of the focal trophic group, leading to less complete depletion of resources used by that group. At the same time, analyses reveal that the standing stock of, and resource depletion by, the most species-rich polyculture tends to be no different from that of the single most productive species used in an experiment. Of the known mechanisms that might explain these trends, results are most consistent with what is called the 'sampling effect', which occurs when diverse communities are more likely to contain and become dominated by the most productive species. Whether this mechanism is widespread in natural communities is currently controversial. Patterns we report are remarkably consistent for four different trophic groups ( producers, herbivores, detritivores and predators) and two major ecosystem types ( aquatic and terrestrial). Collectively, our analyses suggest that the average species loss does indeed affect the functioning of a wide variety of organisms and ecosystems, but the magnitude of these effects is ultimately determined by the identity of species that are going extinct.","Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Ecol Evolut & Marine Biol, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; Univ British Columbia, Dept Zool, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada; Virginia Inst Marine Sci, Coll William & Mary, Gloucester Point, VA 23062 USA; Duke Univ, Dept Biol, Durham, NC 27708 USA; Ohio Wesleyan Univ, Dept Zool, Delaware, OH 43015 USA; Univ Leeds, Fac Biol Sci, Inst Integrat & Comparat Biol, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England; Columbia Univ, Dept Ecol Evolut & Environm Biol, New York, NY 10027 USA","Cardinale, BJ (reprint author), Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Ecol Evolut & Marine Biol, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA.",cardinale@lifesci.ucsb.edu,"Gebauer, Radek/G-6749-2015",,,,,30,861,906,40,810,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,26-Oct,2006,443,7114,,,,,989,992,,10.1038/nature05202,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,098LZ,WOS:000241523400054,17066035,No,,,11/20/17

But the molecular underpinnings of the avascular phenotype have until now remained obscure(5-10) and are all the more remarkable given the presence in the cornea of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-A, a potent stimulator of angiogenesis, and the proximity of the cornea to vascularized tissues. Here we show that the cornea expresses soluble VEGF receptor-1 (sVEGFR-1; also known as sflt-1) and that suppression of this endogenous VEGF-A trap(11) by neutralizing antibodies, RNA interference or Cre-lox-mediated gene disruption abolishes corneal avascularity in mice. The spontaneously vascularized corneas of corn1 and Pax6(+/-) mice(12,13) and Pax6(+/-) patients with aniridia(14) are deficient in sflt-1, and recombinant sflt-1 administration restores corneal avascularity in corn1 and Pax6(+/-) mice. Manatees, the only known creatures uniformly to have vascularized corneas(15), do not express sflt-1, whereas the avascular corneas of dugongs, also members of the order Sirenia, elephants, the closest extant terrestrial phylogenetic relatives of manatees, and other marine mammals ( dolphins and whales) contain sflt-1, indicating that it has a crucial, evolutionarily conserved role. The recognition that sflt-1 is essential for preserving the avascular ambit of the cornea can rationally guide its use as a platform for angiogenic modulators, supports its use in treating neovascular diseases, and might provide insight into the immunological privilege of the cornea.","Med Coll Georgia, Dept Ophthalmol, Augusta, GA 30907 USA; Med Coll Georgia, Dept Cell Biol, Augusta, GA 30907 USA; Augusta Vet Affairs Med Ctr, Augusta, GA 30907 USA; Univ Kentucky, Dept Ophthalmol & Visual Sci, Lexington, KY 40506 USA; Univ Kentucky, Dept Internal Med, Lexington, KY 40506 USA; Univ Kentucky, Dept Physiol, Lexington, KY 40506 USA; Nagoya City Univ, Sch Med, Dept Ophthalmol, Nagoya, Aichi 4678601, Japan; Vanderbilt Univ, Sch Med, Dept Microbiol & Immunol, Nashville, TN 37232 USA; IRCCS, IDI, Mol & Cell Biol Lab, I-00167 Rome, Italy; Univ Florida, Coll Vet Med, Dept Small Anim Clin Sci, Gainesville, FL 32610 USA; Univ Calif Davis, Dept Pathol Microbiol & Immunol, Davis, CA 95616 USA; Sea World, Dept Pathol, San Diego, CA 92109 USA; Johns Hopkins Med Inst, Dept Pathol, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA; Johns Hopkins Med Inst, Wilmer Inst, Eye Pathol Lab, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA; Univ Alabama, Gene Therapy Ctr, Div Human Gene Therapy, Birmingham, AL 35294 USA; James Cook Univ N Queensland, Sch Trop Environm Studies & Geog, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; Univ Wisconsin, Dept Med Genet, Madison, WI 53706 USA; Univ Aberdeen, Sch Med Sci, Aberdeen AB25 2ZD, Scotland; Univ Penn, Sch Med, Penn Muscle Inst, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; Univ Penn, Sch Med, Dept Physiol, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; Univ Tokyo, Inst Med Sci, Tokyo 1088639, Japan; Dept Mol Oncol, San Francisco, CA 94080 USA; CNR, Inst Genet & Biophys, I-80131 Naples, Italy","Ambati, BK (reprint author), Med Coll Georgia, Dept Ophthalmol, Augusta, GA 30907 USA.",bambati@mail.mcg.edu; jamba2@uky.edu,"De Falco, Sandro/P-6724-2015","Marsh, Helene/0000-0003-3492-4992; De Falco, Sandro/0000-0002-6501-1697","Wellcome Trust [, 074127]",,,30,359,380,3,26,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,26-Oct,2006,443,7114,,,,,993,997,,10.1038/nature05249,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,098LZ,WOS:000241523400055,17051153,No,,,11/20/17

A set of cytokine genes was strongly activated in the affected joints of these mice, and their serum contained high levels of anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibody, rheumatoid factor and matrix metalloproteinase-3. Early in the pathogenesis, expression of the gene encoding tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha was upregulated in the bone marrow, and administration of anti-TNF-alpha antibody prevented the development of arthritis. These results indicate that if macrophages cannot degrade mammalian DNA from erythroid precursors and apoptotic cells, they produce TNF-alpha, which activates synovial cells to produce various cytokines, leading to the development of chronic polyarthritis.","Osaka Univ, Sch Med, Dept Genet, Suita, Osaka 5650871, Japan; Osaka Univ, Sch Med, Dept Orthopaed, Suita, Osaka 5650871, Japan; Osaka Univ, Grad Sch Frontier Biosci, Integrat Biol Labs, Genet Lab, Suita, Osaka 5650871, Japan; Japan Sci & Technol Corp, Solut Oriented Res Sci & Technol, Suita, Osaka 5650871, Japan; Iwate Med Univ, Adv Med Sci Res Ctr, High Field Magnet Resonance Imaging Res Inst, Takizawa 0200173, Japan","Nagata, S (reprint author), Osaka Univ, Sch Med, Dept Genet, 2-2 Yamadaoka, Suita, Osaka 5650871, Japan.",nagata@genetic.med.osaka-u.ac.jp,"Yoshioka, Yoshichika/D-1929-2009",,,,,29,230,237,1,11,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,26-Oct,2006,443,7114,,,,,998,1002,,10.1038/nature05245,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,098LZ,WOS:000241523400056,17066036,No,,,11/20/17

In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the histones H2A and H2B are encoded by two gene pairs, named HTA1-HTB1 and HTA2-HTB2 (ref. 8). Previous studies have demonstrated that when HTA2-HTB2 is deleted, HTA1-HTB1 dosage compensates at the transcriptional level(4,9). Here we show that a different mechanism of dosage compensation, at the level of gene copy number, can occur when HTA1-HTB1 is deleted. In this case, HTA2-HTB2 amplifies via creation of a new, small, circular chromosome. This duplication, which contains 39 kb of chromosome II, includes HTA2-HTB2, the histone H3-H4 locus HHT1-HHF1, a centromere and origins of replication. Formation of the new chromosome occurs by recombination between two Ty1 retrotransposon elements that flank this region. Following meiosis, recombination between these two particular Ty1 elements occurs at a greatly elevated level in hta1-htb1 Delta mutants, suggesting that a decreased level of histones H2A and H2B specifically stimulates this amplification of histone genes. Our results demonstrate another mechanism by which histone gene dosage is controlled to maintain genomic integrity.","Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Genet, Boston, MA 02115 USA","Winston, F (reprint author), Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Genet, 77 Ave Louis Pasteur, Boston, MA 02115 USA.",winston@genetics.med.harvard.edu,,,NIGMS NIH HHS [R01 GM032967],,,26,40,40,0,3,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,26-Oct,2006,443,7114,,,,,1003,1007,,10.1038/nature05205,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,098LZ,WOS:000241523400057,17066037,No,,,11/20/17

In Arabidopsis, DNA methylation can be induced by double-stranded RNA through the RNA interference (RNAi) pathway, a response known as RNA-directed DNA methylation(2). This requires a specialized set of RNAi components, including ARGONAUTE4 (AGO4)(3-6). Here we show that AGO4 binds to small RNAs including small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) originating from transposable and repetitive elements, and cleaves target RNA transcripts. Single mutations in the Asp-Asp-His catalytic motif of AGO4 do not affect siRNA-binding activity but abolish its catalytic potential. siRNA accumulation and non-CpG DNA methylation at some loci require the catalytic activity of AGO4, whereas others are less dependent on this activity. Our results are consistent with a model in which AGO4 can function at target loci through two distinct and separable mechanisms. First, AGO4 can recruit components that signal DNA methylation in a manner independent of its catalytic activity. Second, AGO4 catalytic activity can be crucial for the generation of secondary siRNAs that reinforce its repressive effects.","Cold Spring Harbor Lab, Watson Sch Biol Sci, Cold Spring Harbor, NY 11724 USA; Cold Spring Harbor Lab, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Cold Spring Harbor, NY 11724 USA; SUNY Stony Brook, Genet Program, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA; Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Genet & Dev Biol, State Key Lab Plant Genom, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; Genet Informat Res Inst, Mountain View, CA 94043 USA","Hannon, GJ (reprint author), Cold Spring Harbor Lab, Watson Sch Biol Sci, 1 Bungtown Rd, Cold Spring Harbor, NY 11724 USA.",hannon@cshl.edu,,,,,,27,257,280,2,50,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,26-Oct,2006,443,7114,,,,,1008,1012,,10.1038/nature05198,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,098LZ,WOS:000241523400058,16998468,No,,,11/20/17

Current classifications assume that chytrids form an early-diverging clade within the kingdom Fungi and imply a single loss of the spore flagellum, leading to the diversification of terrestrial fungi. Here we develop phylogenetic hypotheses for Fungi using data from six gene regions and nearly 200 species. Our results indicate that there may have been at least four independent losses of the flagellum in the kingdom Fungi. These losses of swimming spores coincided with the evolution of new mechanisms of spore dispersal, such as aerial dispersal in mycelial groups and polar tube eversion in the microsporidia ( unicellular forms that lack mitochondria). The enigmatic microsporidia seem to be derived from an endoparasitic chytrid ancestor similar to Rozella allomycis, on the earliest diverging branch of the fungal phylogenetic tree.","Duke Univ, Dept Biol, Durham, NC 27708 USA; Oregon State Univ, Dept Bot & Plant Pathol, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA; Clark Univ, Dept Biol, Worcester, MA 01610 USA; Univ Minnesota, Dept Plant Biol, St Paul, MN 55108 USA; Field Museum Nat Hist, Chicago, IL 60605 USA; Fachbereich Biol, Abt Pflanzenokol & Systemat, D-67653 Kaiserslautern, Germany; New York Bot Garden, Inst Systemat Bot, Bronx, NY 10458 USA; Duke Univ, Univ Program Genet & Genom, Durham, NC 27708 USA; TH Darmstadt, Inst Bot, D-64287 Darmstadt, Germany; Univ Maine, Dept Biol Sci, Orono, ME 04469 USA; USDA ARS, Natl Ctr Agr Utilizat Res, Peoria, IL 61604 USA; Univ Georgia, Dept Plant Biol, Athens, GA 30605 USA; Univ Alabama, Dept Biol Sci, Tuscaloosa, AL 35487 USA; Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Plant & Microbial Biol, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; Univ Kansas, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA; Univ Wales, Inst Biol Sci, Aberystwyth SY23 3DA, Dyfed, Wales; Inst Grassland & Environm Res, Aberystwyth SY23 3EB, Dyfed, Wales; ARS, US Plant Soil & Nutr Lab, USDA, Plant Protect Res Unit, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; W Virginia Univ, Div Plant & Soil Sci, Morgantown, WV 26506 USA; TechnoSuruga, Chiyoda Ku, Tokyo 1010052, Japan; ARS, Systemat Bot & Mycol Lab, USDA, Beltsville, MD 20705 USA; Washington State Univ, Dept Plant Pathol, Pullman, WA 99164 USA; Harvard Univ Hebaria, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; Agr & Agri Food Canada, Biodivers Mycol & Bot, Ottawa, ON K1A 0C6, Canada; Univ N Carolina, Inst Marine Sci, Morehead City, NC 28557 USA; Oregon State Univ, Mid Columbia Agr Res & Extens Ctr, Hood River, OR 97031 USA; Cent Bur Schimmelcultures, Fungal Biodivers Ctr, NL-3508 AD Utrecht, Netherlands; Univ Tennessee, Dept Bot, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA; Okayama Univ, Fac Agr, Okayama 7008530, Japan; Univ Kassel, Inst Biol, D-34132 Kassel, Germany; Brandon Univ, Dept Bot, Brandon, MB R7A 6A9, Canada; Penn State Univ, Dept Plant Pathol, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; Adviesbur Bryol Lichenol, NL-3762 XK Soest, Netherlands; Museum Natl Hist Nat, L-2160 Luxembourg, Luxembourg; Univ Hamburg, Biozentrum Klein Flottbek & Bot Garten, D-22609 Hamburg, Germany","James, TY (reprint author), Duke Univ, Dept Biol, Durham, NC 27708 USA.",tyj2@duke.edu; fungi@duke.edu,"Wang, Zheng/A-2318-2011; Stajich, Jason/C-7297-2008; Cox, Cymon/D-1303-2012; Wynns, Anja/E-5434-2012; Gueidan, Cecile/C-8803-2014; Geiser, David/J-9950-2013; SchuSSler, Arthur/F-1681-2011; Crous, Pedro/H-1489-2012; Schoch, Conrad/J-4825-2012; Lumbsch, Thorsten/K-3573-2012; Binder, Manfred/C-8571-2013; Slot, Jason/E-4802-2011; griffith, gareth/A-1970-2009; Langer, Ewald/D-8479-2012","Wang, Zheng/0000-0002-8849-8549; Stajich, Jason/0000-0002-7591-0020; Cox, Cymon/0000-0002-4927-979X; Crous, Pedro/0000-0001-9085-8825; Schoch, Conrad/0000-0003-1839-5322; Lumbsch, Thorsten/0000-0003-1512-835X; Matsuura, Kenji/0000-0002-9099-6694; Amtoft Wynns, Anja/0000-0002-6013-9456; Vilgalys, Rytas/0000-0001-8299-3605",,,,41,913,976,16,283,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,19-Oct,2006,443,7113,,,,,818,822,,10.1038/nature05110,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,096FJ,WOS:000241362700042,17051209,No,,,11/20/17

Doa10 ( also known as Ssm4), a yeast transmembrane ubiquitin ligase (E3), resides in the endoplasmic reticulum ( ER), but it attaches ubiquitin to soluble proteins that concentrate in the nucleus. A central question is how nuclear substrates gain access to an enzyme in the ER. Here we show that Doa10 reaches the inner nuclear membrane. A subcomplex of nuclear pore subunits is important for this transport. Notably, another ER transmembrane E3, Hrd1 ( also known as Der3), cannot localize efficiently to the inner nuclear membrane. Tethering Doa10 at the cell periphery inhibits degradation of soluble nuclear substrates but not cytoplasmic ones. If Doa10 is released from these peripheral sites, localization of Doa10 to the nuclear envelope and degradation of its nuclear substrates are restored in parallel. Thus, localization of Doa10 to the inner nuclear membrane is necessary for nuclear substrate degradation. These data indicate that different membrane ubiquitin ligases are spatially sorted within the ER - nuclear envelope membrane system and that this differential localization contributes to their specificity.","Yale Univ, Dept Mol Biophys & Biochem, New Haven, CT 06520 USA","Hochstrasser, M (reprint author), Yale Univ, Dept Mol Biophys & Biochem, 266 Whitney Ave,POB 208114, New Haven, CT 06520 USA.",mark.hochstrasser@yale.edu,,,,,,34,85,86,0,5,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,19-Oct,2006,443,7113,,,,,827,831,,10.1038/nature05170,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,096FJ,WOS:000241362700044,17051211,No,,,11/20/17

In addition, the outer galaxy disk is warped, as seen at both optical(8) and radio(9) wavelengths. The halo contains numerous loops and ripples. Here we report the presence of a second, inner dust ring with projected dimensions of 1.5 x 1 kiloparsecs and offset by about half a kiloparsec from the centre of the galaxy (based upon an analysis of previously-obtained data(10)). The two rings appear to be density waves propagating in the disk. Numerical simulations indicate that both rings result from a companion galaxy plunging through the centre of the disk of M31.

This suggestion, and parallel assumptions about other topographic cold traps, is a significant element in planning for future lunar landings. Hydrogen enhancements have been identified in the polar regions(3), but these data do not identify the host species or its local distribution. The earlier Earth-based radar data lack the resolution and coverage for detailed studies of the relationship between radar scattering properties, cold traps in permanently shadowed areas, and local terrain features such as the walls and ejecta of small craters. Here we present new 20-m resolution, 13-cm-wavelength radar images that show no evidence for concentrated deposits of water ice in Shackleton crater or elsewhere at the south pole. The polarization properties normally associated with reflections from icy surfaces in the Solar System(4-6) were found at all the observed latitudes and are strongly correlated with the rockstrewn walls and ejecta of young craters, including the inner wall of Shackleton. There is no correlation between the polarization properties and the degree of solar illumination.

Distributed entanglement is established by preparing an entangled pair of quantum particles in one location, and transporting one member of the pair to another location. However, decoherence during transport reduces the quality ( fidelity) of the entanglement. A protocol to achieve entanglement 'purification' has been proposed(4) to improve the fidelity after transport. This protocol uses separate quantum operations at each location and classical communication to distil high-fidelity entangled pairs from lower-fidelity pairs. Proof-of-principle experiments distilling entangled photon pairs have been carried out(5-9). However, these experiments obtained distilled pairs with a low probability of success and required destruction of the entangled pairs, rendering them unavailable for further processing. Here we report efficient and non-destructive entanglement purification(4) with atomic quantum bits. Two noisy entangled pairs were created and distilled into one higher-fidelity pair available for further use. Success probabilities were above 35 per cent. The many applications of entanglement purification make it one of the most important techniques in quantum information processing.","Natl Inst Stand & Technol, Boulder, CO 80305 USA","Leibfried, D (reprint author), Natl Inst Stand & Technol, Boulder, CO 80305 USA.",dil@boulder.nist.gov,"Jost, John/F-4701-2010","Britton, Joe/0000-0001-8103-7347",,,,22,91,96,1,7,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,19-Oct,2006,443,7113,,,,,838,841,,10.1038/nature05146,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,096FJ,WOS:000241362700047,17051214,No,,,11/20/17

North Atlantic cold periods during Heinrich events and millennial-scale cold events (stadials) have been linked with climatic changes in the tropical Atlantic Ocean and South America(2-4), as well as the Indian and East Asian monsoon systems(5,6), but not with tropical Pacific sea surface temperatures(7). Here we present a high-resolution record of sea surface temperatures in the eastern tropical Pacific derived from alkenone unsaturation measurements. Our data show a temperature drop of 1 degrees C, synchronous ( within dating uncertainties) with the shutdown of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation during Heinrich event 1, and a smaller temperature drop of 0.5 degrees C synchronous with the smaller reduction in the overturning circulation during the Younger Dryas event. Both cold events coincide with maxima in surface ocean productivity as inferred from Th-230-normalized carbon burial fluxes, suggesting increased upwelling at the time. From the concurrence of equatorial Pacific cooling with the two North Atlantic cold periods during deglaciation, we conclude that these millennial-scale climate changes were probably driven by a reorganization of the oceans' thermohaline circulation, although possibly amplified by tropical ocean - atmosphere interaction as suggested before(8).","Dalhousie Univ, Dept Oceanog, Halifax, NS B3H 4J1, Canada; Univ British Columbia, Dept Earth & Ocean Sci, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada; Woods Hole Oceanog Inst, Dept Marine Chem & Geochem, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA; Alfred Wegener Inst Polar & Marine Res, D-27570 Bremerhaven, Germany; Univ Bremen, Dept Geosci, D-28359 Bremen, Germany; Oregon State Univ, Coll Ocean & Atmospher Sci, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA","Kienast, M (reprint author), Dalhousie Univ, Dept Oceanog, Halifax, NS B3H 4J1, Canada.",markus.kienast@dal.ca,"Mollenhauer, Gesine/B-5190-2015","Mollenhauer, Gesine/0000-0001-5138-564X",,,,32,86,90,6,38,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,19-Oct,2006,443,7113,,,,,846,849,,10.1038/nature05222,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,096FJ,WOS:000241362700049,17051216,No,,,11/20/17

Recent investigations show that the number of active submarine mud volcanoes might be much higher than anticipated ( for example, see refs 3 - 5), and that gas emitted from deep-sea seeps might reach the upper mixed ocean(6-8). Unfortunately, global methane emission from active submarine mud volcanoes cannot be quantified because their number and gas release are unknown(9). It is also unclear how efficiently methane-oxidizing microorganisms remove methane. Here we investigate the methane-emitting Haakon Mosby Mud Volcano (HMMV, Barents Sea, 72 degrees N, 14 degrees 44' E; 1,250 m water depth) to provide quantitative estimates of the in situ composition, distribution and activity of methanotrophs in relation to gas emission. The HMMV hosts three key communities: aerobic methanotrophic bacteria (Methylococcales), anaerobic methanotrophic archaea (ANME-2) thriving below siboglinid tubeworms, and a previously undescribed clade of archaea (ANME-3) associated with bacterial mats. We found that the upward flow of sulphate- and oxygen-free mud volcano fluids restricts the availability of these electron acceptors for methane oxidation, and hence the habitat range of methanotrophs. This mechanism limits the capacity of the microbial methane filter at active marine mud volcanoes to <40% of the total flux.","Max Planck Inst Marine Microbiol, D-28359 Bremen, Germany; Alfred Wegener Inst Polar & Marine Res, D-27515 Bremerhaven, Germany; IFREMER, Ctr Brest, F-29280 Plouzane, France; Int Jacobs Univ Bremen, D-28759 Bremen, Germany","Boetius, A (reprint author), Max Planck Inst Marine Microbiol, D-28359 Bremen, Germany.",aboetius@mpi-bremen.de,"Amann, Rudolf/C-6534-2014; Losekann, Tina/J-6358-2014; Niemann, Helge/C-6630-2014; Boetius, Antje/D-5459-2013","Amann, Rudolf/0000-0002-0846-7372; Niemann, Helge/0000-0002-3468-8304; Boetius, Antje/0000-0003-2117-4176; Sauter, Eberhard/0000-0001-7954-952X; Schlueter, Michael/0000-0002-4997-3802; de Beer, Dirk/0000-0001-5274-1781",,,,30,270,290,3,115,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,19-Oct,2006,443,7113,,,,,854,858,,10.1038/nature05227,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,096FJ,WOS:000241362700051,17051217,No,,,11/20/17

We distinguish environmental effects from fishing effects by comparing the temporal variability of exploited versus unexploited fish stocks living in the same environments. Using the unique suite of 50-year-long larval fish surveys from the California Cooperative Oceanic Fisheries Investigations(4) we analyse fishing as a treatment effect in a long-term ecological experiment. Here we present evidence from the marine environment that exploited species exhibit higher temporal variability in abundance than unexploited species. This remains true after accounting for life-history effects, abundance, ecological traits and phylogeny. The increased variability of exploited populations is probably caused by fishery-induced truncation of the age structure, which reduces the capacity of populations to buffer environmental events(1,5,8,9). Therefore, to avoid collapse, fisheries must be managed not only to sustain the total viable biomass but also to prevent the significant truncation of age structure(1,5,8,9). The double jeopardy of fishing to potentially deplete stock sizes and, more immediately, to amplify the peaks and valleys of population variability(7), calls for a precautionary management approach(10,11).","Univ Calif San Diego, Scripps Inst Oceanog, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, SW Fisheries Sci Ctr, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Fac Nat Sci, Div Biol, London SW7 2AZ, England; Univ Oxford, Dept Zool, Oxford OX1 3PS, England","Sugihara, G (reprint author), Univ Calif San Diego, Scripps Inst Oceanog, 9500 Gilman Dr, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.",gsugihara@ucsd.edu,"Hsieh, Chih-hao/B-3797-2008","Hsieh, Chih-hao/0000-0001-5935-7272",,,,30,284,294,5,85,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,19-Oct,2006,443,7113,,,,,859,862,,10.1038/nature05232,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,096FJ,WOS:000241362700052,17051218,No,,,11/20/17

Unlike that of the major spliceosome, which arose early in the eukaryotic lineage(13,14), the evolutionary history of the minor spliceosome is unclear because there is evidence of it in so few organisms. Here we report the identification of homologues of minor-spliceosome-specific proteins and snRNAs, and U12-type introns, in distantly related eukaryotic microbes (protists) and in a fungus ( Rhizopus oryzae).

Here we report structures of human IDE in complex with four substrates ( insulin B chain, amyloid-beta peptide ( 1 - 40), amylin and glucagon). The amino- and carboxy-terminal domains of IDE (IDE-N and IDE-C, respectively) form an enclosed cage just large enough to encapsulate insulin. Extensive contacts between IDE-N and IDE-C keep the degradation chamber of IDE inaccessible to substrates. Repositioning of the IDE domains enables substrate access to the catalytic cavity. IDE uses size and charge distribution of the substrate-binding cavity selectively to entrap structurally diverse polypeptides. The enclosed substrate undergoes conformational changes to form beta-sheets with two discrete regions of IDE for its degradation. Consistent with this model, mutations disrupting the contacts between IDE-N and IDE-C increase IDE catalytic activity 40-fold.

The nucleoprotein filaments saturate the DNA and extend it 1.6-fold. At early time points, discrete RecA clusters are seen, permitting analysis of single-filament growth from individual nuclei. Formation of nascent RecA filaments is independent of ATP hydrolysis but is dependent on the type of nucleotide cofactor and the RecA concentration, suggesting that nucleation involves binding of 4 - 5 ATP - RecA monomers to DNA. Individual RecA filaments grow at rates of 3 - 10 nm s(-1). Growth is bidirectional and, in contrast to nucleation, independent of nucleotide cofactor, suggesting addition of 2 - 7 monomers s(-1). These results are in accord with extensive genetic and biochemical studies, and indicate that assembly in vivo is controlled at the nucleation step. We anticipate that our approach and conclusions can be extended to the related eukaryotic counterpart, Rad51 (ref. 8), and to regulation by assembly mediators(9-11).","Univ Calif Davis, Microbiol Sect, Davis, CA 95616 USA; Univ Calif Davis, Sect Mol & Cellular Biol, Davis, CA 95616 USA; Univ Calif Davis, Ctr Genet & Dev, Davis, CA 95616 USA","Kowalczykowski, SC (reprint author), Univ Calif Davis, Microbiol Sect, Davis, CA 95616 USA.",sckowalczykowski@ucdavis.edu,,,,,,30,143,144,1,25,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,19-Oct,2006,443,7113,,,,,875,878,,10.1038/nature05197,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,096FJ,WOS:000241362700056,16988658,No,,,11/20/17

Although their intracellular localization to mitochondria and the endoplasmic reticulum has focused research on these organelles, how they function remains unknown. Two members of the Bcl-2 family, Bax and Bak, change intracellular location early in the promotion of apoptosis to concentrate in focal clusters at sites of mitochondrial division. Here we report that in healthy cells Bax or Bak is required for normal fusion of mitochondria into elongated tubules. Bax seems to induce mitochondrial fusion by activating assembly of the large GTPase Mfn2 and changing its submitochondrial distribution and membrane mobility properties that correlate with different GTP-bound states of Mfn2. Our results show that Bax and Bak regulate mitochondrial dynamics in healthy cells and indicate that Bcl-2 family members may also regulate apoptosis through organelle morphogenesis machineries.","NINCDS, Biochem Sect, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA","Karbowski, M (reprint author), Univ Maryland, Inst Biotechnol, Ctr Med Biotechnol, UMBI Bldg,725 W Lombard St, Baltimore, MD 21201 USA.",karbowsm@ninds.nih.gov; youler@ninds.nih.gov,,"Harwig, Megan/0000-0003-2140-5739",Intramural NIH HHS,,,24,407,421,0,26,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,12-Oct,2006,443,7112,,,,,658,662,,10.1038/nature05111,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,093HX,WOS:000241160500038,17035996,No,,,11/20/17

At visible wavelengths its surface is hidden by dense orange-brown smog, which is produced in the stratosphere by photochemical reactions following the dissociation of methane by solar ultraviolet light. The most abundant of the products of these reactions is ethane, and enough of it should have been generated over the life of the Solar System to form a satellite-wide ocean one kilometre deep(2). Radar observations(3) have found specular reflections in 75 per cent of the surface spots observed, but optical searches for a sun-glint off an ocean have been negative(4). Here I explain the mysterious absence or rarity of liquid ethane: it condenses onto the smog particles, instead of into liquid drops, at the cold temperatures in Titan's atmosphere. This dusty combination of smog and ethane, forming deposits several kilometres thick on the surface, including the observed dunes and dark areas, could be named 'smust'.

This work has been performed principally within the setting of cavity quantum electrodynamics(1-4) with diverse physical systems(5), including single atoms in Fabry-Perot resonators(1,6), quantum dots coupled to micropillars and photonic bandgap cavities(7,8) and Cooper pairs interacting with superconducting resonators(9,10). Experiments with single, localized atoms have been at the forefront of these advances(11-15) with the use of optical resonators in high-finesse Fabry-Perot configurations(16). As a result of the extreme technical challenges involved in further improving the multilayer dielectric mirror coatings(17) of these resonators and in scaling to large numbers of devices, there has been increased interest in the development of alternative microcavity systems(5). Here we show strong coupling between individual caesium atoms and the fields of a high-quality toroidal microresonator. From observations of transit events for single atoms falling through the resonator's evanescent field, we determine the coherent coupling rate for interactions near the surface of the resonator. We develop a theoretical model to quantify our observations, demonstrating that strong coupling is achieved, with the rate of coherent coupling exceeding the dissipative rates of the atom and the cavity. Our work opens the way for investigations of optical processes with single atoms and photons in lithographically fabricated microresonators. Applications include the implementation of quantum networks(18,19), scalable quantum logic with photons(20), and quantum information processing on atom chips(21).","CALTECH, Norman Bridge Lab Phys 12 33, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA; CALTECH, TJ Watson Lab Appl Phys, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA","Kimble, HJ (reprint author), CALTECH, Norman Bridge Lab Phys 12 33, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA.",hjkimble@caltech.edu,"Kippenberg, Tobias/B-3133-2013; Bowen, Warwick/A-7630-2010; Dayan, Barak/Q-7480-2017","Bowen, Warwick/0000-0001-8127-1715; Dayan, Barak/0000-0001-8592-8550",,,,30,438,447,10,173,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,12-Oct,2006,443,7112,,,,,671,674,,10.1038/nature05147,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,093HX,WOS:000241160500041,17035998,No,,,11/20/17

The standard model of particle physics predicts a QCD-related transition that is relevant for the evolution of the early Universe. At low temperatures, the dominant degrees of freedom are colourless bound states of hadrons (such as protons and pions). However, QCD is asymptotically free, meaning that at high energies or temperatures the interaction gets weaker and weaker(1,2), causing hadrons to break up. This behaviour underlies the predicted cosmological transition between the low-temperature hadronic phase and a high-temperature quark-gluon plasma phase (for simplicity, we use the word 'phase' to characterize regions with different dominant degrees of freedom). Despite enormous theoretical effort, the nature of this finite-temperature QCD transition (that is, first-order, second-order or analytic crossover) remains ambiguous. Here we determine the nature of the QCD transition using computationally demanding lattice calculations for physical quark masses. Susceptibilities are extrapolated to vanishing lattice spacing for three physical volumes, the smallest and largest of which differ by a factor of five. This ensures that a true transition should result in a dramatic increase of the susceptibilities. No such behaviour is observed: our finite-size scaling analysis shows that the finite-temperature QCD transition in the hot early Universe was not a real phase transition, but an analytic crossover (involving a rapid change, as opposed to a jump, as the temperature varied). As such, it will be difficult to find experimental evidence of this transition from astronomical observations.","Univ Wuppertal, Dept Phys, D-42097 Wuppertal, Germany; Eotvos Lorand Univ, Inst Theoret Phys, H-1117 Budapest, Hungary","Katz, SD (reprint author), Univ Wuppertal, Dept Phys, D-42097 Wuppertal, Germany.",katz@bodri.elte.hu,"Katz, Sandor/A-4154-2011","Katz, Sandor/0000-0001-6524-2965",,,,29,757,763,3,25,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,12-Oct,2006,443,7112,,,,,675,678,,10.1038/nature05120,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,093HX,WOS:000241160500042,17035999,No,,,11/20/17

Because they are often the largest components in circuits, extensive efforts are directed at reducing their size through the use of high-permittivity insulators such as perovskite-structure SrTiO3 (refs 1, 2), which should provide more capacitance per unit area of device. Unfortunately, most experiments on thin-film SrTiO3 capacitors have yielded capacitance values that are orders of magnitude smaller than expected(3). The microscopic origin of this reduced capacitance, which is often discussed in terms of a low-permittivity interfacial 'dead layer'(4), is not well understood. Whether such a dead layer exists at all, and if so, whether it is an intrinsic property of an ideal metal-insulator interface or a result of processing issues such as defects and strains, are controversial questions. Here we present fully ab initio calculations of the dielectric properties of realistic SrRuO3/SrTiO3/SrRuO3 nanocapacitors, and show that the observed dramatic capacitance reduction is indeed an intrinsic effect. We demonstrate the existence of a dielectric dead layer by calculating the dielectric profile across the interface and analyse its origin by extracting the ionic and electronic contributions to the electrostatic screening. We establish a correspondence between the dead layer and the hardening of the collective SrTiO3 zone-centre polar modes, and determine the influence of the electrode by repeating our calculations for Pt/SrTiO3/Pt capacitors. Our results provide practical guidelines for minimizing the deleterious effects of the dielectric dead layer in nanoscale devices.","Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Mat, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA","Stengel, M (reprint author), Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Mat, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA.",stengel@mrl.ucsb.edu,"Spaldin, Nicola/A-1017-2010; Stengel, Massimiliano/E-2934-2010","Spaldin, Nicola/0000-0003-0709-9499; Stengel, Massimiliano/0000-0003-4175-3888",,,,29,298,300,8,158,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,12-Oct,2006,443,7112,,,,,679,682,,10.1038/nature05148,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,093HX,WOS:000241160500043,17036000,No,,,11/20/17

The largest chemical transition was the 'Great Oxidation', approximately 2.4 billion years ago, when atmospheric oxygen concentrations rose from less than 10(-5) of the present atmospheric level (PAL) to more than 0.01 PAL, and possibly(2) to more than 0.1 PAL. This transition took place long after oxygenic photosynthesis is thought to have evolved(3-5), but the causes of this delay and of the Great Oxidation itself remain uncertain(6-11). Here we show that the origin of oxygenic photosynthesis gave rise to two simultaneously stable steady states for atmospheric oxygen. The existence of a low-oxygen (less than 10(-5) PAL) steady state explains how a reducing atmosphere persisted for at least 300 million years after the onset of oxygenic photosynthesis. The Great Oxidation can be understood as a switch to the high-oxygen (more than 5 x 10(-3) PAL) steady state. The bistability arises because ultraviolet shielding of the troposphere by ozone becomes effective once oxygen levels exceed 10(-5) PAL, causing a nonlinear increase in the lifetime of atmospheric oxygen. Our results indicate that the existence of oxygenic photosynthesis is not a sufficient condition for either an oxygen-rich atmosphere or the presence of an ozone layer, which has implications for detecting life on other planets using atmospheric analysis(12,13) and for the evolution of multicellular life.","Univ E Anglia, Sch Environm Sci, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England; Ctr Ecol & Hydrol, Edinburgh Res Stn, Penicuik EH26 0QB, Midlothian, Scotland","Goldblatt, C (reprint author), Univ E Anglia, Sch Environm Sci, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England.",c.goldblatt@uea.ac.uk,,"Watson, Andrew/0000-0002-9654-8147",,,,30,121,127,4,82,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,12-Oct,2006,443,7112,,,,,683,686,,10.1038/nature05169,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,093HX,WOS:000241160500044,17036001,No,,,11/20/17

Here we use an exceptionally long (24.5-2.5 Myr ago), dense, and well-dated terrestrial record of rodent lineages from central Spain, and show the existence of turnover cycles with periods of 2.4-2.5 and 1.0 Myr. We link these cycles to low-frequency modulations of Milankovitch oscillations(8), and show that pulses of turnover occur at minima of the 2.37-Myr eccentricity cycle and nodes of the 1.2-Myr obliquity cycle. Because obliquity nodes and eccentricity minima are associated with ice sheet expansion and cooling and affect regional precipitation, we infer that long-period astronomical climate forcing is a major determinant of species turnover in small mammals and probably other groups as well.","Univ Utrecht, Fac Geosci, Dept Earth Sci, NL-3584 CD Utrecht, Netherlands; Univ Complutense, Fac Geol, Dept Palaeontol, E-28040 Madrid, Spain; Natl Museum Nat Hist, NL-2333 CR Leiden, Netherlands; Univ Lyon 1, Fac Earth Sci, F-69622 Villeurbanne, France; CSIC, Natl Museum Nat Hist, E-28006 Madrid, Spain","van Dam, JA (reprint author), Univ Utrecht, Fac Geosci, Dept Earth Sci, Budapestlaan 4, NL-3584 CD Utrecht, Netherlands.",jdam@geo.uu.nl,"Pelaez-Campomanes, Pablo/G-4561-2010; van Dam, Jan/B-9420-2012","Pelaez-Campomanes, Pablo/0000-0002-6551-1026; ",,,,30,134,139,1,22,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,12-Oct,2006,443,7112,,,,,687,691,,10.1038/nature05163,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,093HX,WOS:000241160500045,17036002,No,,,11/20/17

In populations of endangered wildlife, the intervention required to deliver such coverage can be undesirable and impractical(2); however, endangered populations are increasingly threatened by outbreaks of infectious disease for which effective vaccines exist(3,4). As an alternative, wildlife epidemiologists could adopt a vaccination strategy that protects a population from the consequences of only the largest outbreaks of disease. Here we provide a successful example of this strategy in the Ethiopian wolf, the world's rarest canid(5), which persists in small subpopulations threatened by repeated outbreaks of rabies introduced by domestic dogs(6). On the basis of data from past outbreaks, we propose an approach that controls the spread of disease through habitat corridors between subpopulations and that requires only low vaccination coverage. This approach reduces the extent of rabies outbreaks and should significantly enhance the long-term persistence of the population. Our study shows that vaccination used to enhance metapopulation persistence through elimination of the largest outbreaks of disease requires lower coverage than the conventional objective of reducing the reproduction number of an infectious agent to less than one(1).","Univ Glasgow, Div Environm & Evolutionary Biol, Glasgow G12 8QQ, Lanark, Scotland; Univ Oxford, Wildlife Conservat Res Unit, Oxford OX13 5QL, England; Ethiopian Wolf Conservat Programme, Robe, Bale, Ethiopia; Univ Edinburgh, Easter Bush Vet Ctr, Royal Dick Sch Vet Studies, Wildlife & Emerging Dis Sect, Roslin EH25 9RG, Midlothian, Scotland; Swansea Univ, Sch Med, Inst Life Sci, Swansea SA2 8PP, W Glam, Wales; Univ Calif Los Angeles, Conservat Genet Resource Ctr, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; Univ Edinburgh, Ctr Infect Dis, Ashworth Labs, Edinburgh EH9 3JF, Midlothian, Scotland; Frankfurt Zool Soc, Arusha, Tanzania","Haydon, DT (reprint author), Univ Glasgow, Div Environm & Evolutionary Biol, Glasgow G12 8QQ, Lanark, Scotland.",D.Haydon@bio.gla.ac.uk,"Matthews, Louise/E-2913-2013","Matthews, Louise/0000-0003-4420-8367; Tallents, Lucy/0000-0001-5601-0468; Haydon, Daniel/0000-0002-1240-1886; Knobel, Darryn/0000-0002-0425-3799",,,,28,91,92,2,71,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,12-Oct,2006,443,7112,,,,,692,695,,10.1038/nature05177,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,093HX,WOS:000241160500046,17036003,No,,,11/20/17

A salient feature of all photoreceptor cells is the presence of a specialized compartment ( disc outer segments in vertebrates, and microvillar rhabdomeres in insects), whose primary role is to accommodate the millions of light receptor molecules required for efficient photon collection. In insects, compound eyes can have very different inner architectures(1-3). Fruitflies and houseflies have an open rhabdom system, in which the seven rhabdomeres of each ommatidium are separated from each other and function as independent light guides. In contrast, bees and various mosquitoes and beetle species have a closed system, in which rhabdomeres within each ommatidium are fused to each other, thus sharing the same visual axis. To understand the transition between open and closed rhabdom systems, we isolated and characterized the role of Drosophila genes involved in rhabdomere assembly. Here we show that Spacemaker, a secreted protein expressed only in the eyes of insects with open rhabdom systems, acts together with Prominin and the cell adhesion molecule Chaoptin to choreograph the partitioning of rhabdomeres into an open system. Furthermore, the complete loss of spacemaker (spam) converts an open rhabdom system to a closed one, whereas its targeted expression to photoreceptors of a closed system markedly reorganizes the architecture of the compound eyes to resemble an open system. Our results provide a molecular atlas for the construction of microvillar assemblies and illustrate the critical effect of differences in a single structural protein in morphogenesis.","Univ Calif San Diego, Howard Hughes Med Inst, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Neurobiol, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Neurosci, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA","Zuker, CS (reprint author), Univ Calif San Diego, Howard Hughes Med Inst, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.",azelhof@flyeye.ucsd.edu; charles@flyeye.ucsd.edu,,"Zelhof, Andrew/0000-0001-7085-822X","NEI NIH HHS [R01 EY006979, R01 EY006979-17]",,,21,87,90,0,30,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,12-Oct,2006,443,7112,,,,,696,699,,10.1038/nature05128,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,093HX,WOS:000241160500047,17036004,No,,,11/20/17

Blood flow is assumed to be regulated by precapillary arterioles, because capillaries lack smooth muscle. However, most (65%) noradrenergic innervation of CNS blood vessels terminates near capillaries rather than arterioles(4), and in muscle and brain a dilatory signal propagates from vessels near metabolically active cells to precapillary arterioles(5,6), suggesting that blood flow control is initiated in capillaries. Pericytes, which are apposed to CNS capillaries and contain contractile proteins(7), could initiate such signalling. Here we show that pericytes can control capillary diameter in whole retina and cerebellar slices. Electrical stimulation of retinal pericytes evoked a localized capillary constriction, which propagated at similar to 2 mu m s(-1) to constrict distant pericytes. Superfused ATP in retina or noradrenaline in cerebellum resulted in constriction of capillaries by pericytes, and glutamate reversed the constriction produced by noradrenaline. Electrical stimulation or puffing GABA (gamma-amino butyric acid) receptor blockers in the inner retina also evoked pericyte constriction. In simulated ischaemia, some pericytes constricted capillaries. Pericytes are probably modulators of blood flow in response to changes in neural activity, which may contribute to functional imaging signals and to CNS vascular disease.","UCL, Dept Physiol, London WC1E 6BT, England","Attwell, D (reprint author), UCL, Dept Physiol, Gower St, London WC1E 6BT, England.",D.Attwell@ucl.ac.uk,,"Peppiatt-Wildman, Claire/0000-0002-4406-8571","Wellcome Trust [, 017948, 075232]",,,30,437,455,7,50,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,12-Oct,2006,443,7112,,,,,700,704,,10.1038/nature05193,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,093HX,WOS:000241160500048,17036005,No,,,11/20/17

Glutamate-mediated excitation of A17 cells elicits GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid)-mediated inhibitory feedback onto RBCs4-6, but the mechanisms that underlie GABA release from the dendrites of A17 cells are unknown. If, as observed at all other synapses studied, voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs) couple membrane depolarization to neurotransmitter release(7), feedforward excitatory postsynaptic potentials could spread through A17 dendrites to elicit 'surround' feedback inhibitory transmission at neighbouring synapses. Here we show, however, that GABA release from A17 cells in the rat retina does not depend on VGCCs or membrane depolarization. Instead, calcium-permeable AMPA (alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid) receptors (AMPARs), activated by glutamate released from RBCs, provide the calcium influx necessary to trigger GABA release from A17 cells. The AMPAR-mediated calcium signal is amplified by calcium-induced calcium release (CICR) from intracellular calcium stores. These results describe a fast synapse that operates independently of VGCCs and membrane depolarization and reveal a previously unknown form of feedback inhibition within a neural circuit.","NINDS, Synapt Physiol Unit, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA","Diamond, JS (reprint author), NINDS, Synapt Physiol Unit, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA.",diamondj@ninds.nih.gov,"Diamond, Jeffrey/C-1835-2015","Diamond, Jeffrey/0000-0002-1770-2629",Intramural NIH HHS; NINDS NIH HHS [K22 NS043365],,,30,96,99,0,9,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,12-Oct,2006,443,7112,,,,,705,708,,10.1038/nature05123,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,093HX,WOS:000241160500049,17036006,No,,,11/20/17

Here we show that nesfatin, corresponding to NEFA/nucleobindin(2) (NUCB2), a secreted protein of unknown function, is expressed in the appetite-control hypothalamic nuclei in rats. Intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) injection of NUCB2 reduces feeding. Rat cerebrospinal fluid contains nesfatin-1, an amino-terminal fragment derived from NUCB2, and its expression is decreased in the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus under starved conditions. I.c.v. injection of nesfatin-1 decreases food intake in a dose-dependent manner, whereas injection of an antibody neutralizing nesfatin-1 stimulates appetite. In contrast, i.c.v. injection of other possible fragments processed from NUCB2 does not promote satiety, and conversion of NUCB2 to nesfatin-1 is necessary to induce feeding suppression. Chronic i.c.v. injection of nesfatin-1 reduces body weight, whereas rats gain body weight after chronic i.c.v. injection of antisense morpholino oligonucleotide against the gene encoding NUCB2. Nesfatin-1-induced anorexia occurs in Zucker rats with a leptin receptor mutation, and an anti-nesfatin-1 antibody does not block leptin-induced anorexia. In contrast, central injection of alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone elevates NUCB2 gene expression in the paraventricular nucleus, and satiety by nesfatin-1 is abolished by an antagonist of the melanocortin-3/4 receptor.

Aprataxin is a member of the histidine triad (HIT) family of nucleotide hydrolases and transferases(3), and inactivating mutations are largely confined to this HIT domain. Aprataxin associates with the DNA repair proteins XRCC1 and XRCC4, which are partners of DNA ligase III and ligase IV, respectively(4-7), suggestive of a role in DNA repair. Consistent with this, APTX-defective cell lines are sensitive to agents that cause single-strand breaks and exhibit an increased incidence of induced chromosomal aberrations(4,5,8). It is not, however, known whether aprataxin has a direct or indirect role in DNA repair, or what the physiological substrate of aprataxin might be. Here we show, using purified aprataxin protein and extracts derived from either APTX-defective chicken DT40 cells or Aptx(-/-) mouse primary neural cells, that aprataxin resolves abortive DNA ligation intermediates. Specifically, aprataxin catalyses the nucleophilic release of adenylate groups covalently linked to 5'-phosphate termini at single-strand nicks and gaps, resulting in the production of 5'-phosphate termini that can be efficiently rejoined. These data indicate that neurological disorders associated with APTX mutations may be caused by the gradual accumulation of unrepaired DNA strand breaks resulting from abortive DNA ligation events.","Canc Res UK, London Res Inst, Clare Hall Labs, S Mimms EN6 3LD, Herts, England; Univ Sussex, Genome Damage & Stabil Ctr, Brighton BN1 9RQ, E Sussex, England; Fac Pharm, Dept Biochem, Cairo, Egypt; St Jude Childrens Hosp, Dept Genet & Tumor Cell Biol, Memphis, TN 38105 USA","West, SC (reprint author), Canc Res UK, London Res Inst, Clare Hall Labs, S Mimms EN6 3LD, Herts, England.",stephen.west@cancer.org.uk,,"West, Stephen/0000-0001-8848-9418; Katyal, Sachin/0000-0002-7790-4054; , Sherif/0000-0003-2721-7763",Medical Research Council [G0001259],,,30,200,207,1,7,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,12-Oct,2006,443,7112,,,,,713,716,,10.1038/nature05164,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,093HX,WOS:000241160500051,16964241,No,,,11/20/17

Despite its prevalence, little is known about the physiological alterations that accompany polyploidy. We previously described 'ploidy-specific lethality', where a gene deletion that is not lethal in haploid or diploid budding yeast causes lethality in triploids or tetraploids. Here we report a genome-wide screen to identify ploidy-specific lethal functions. Only 39 out of 3,740 mutations screened exhibited ploidy-specific lethality. Almost all of these mutations affect genomic stability by impairing homologous recombination, sister chromatid cohesion, or mitotic spindle function. We uncovered defects in wild-type tetraploids predicted by the screen, and identified mechanisms by which tetraploidization affects genomic stability. We show that tetraploids have a high incidence of syntelic/monopolar kinetochore attachments to the spindle pole. We suggest that this defect can be explained by mismatches in the ability to scale the size of the spindle pole body, spindle and kinetochores. Thus, geometric constraints may have profound effects on genome stability; the phenomenon described here may be relevant in a variety of biological contexts, including disease states such as cancer.","Dana Farber Canc Inst, Dept Pediat Oncol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; Harvard Univ, Dept Phys, Boston, MA 02115 USA; Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Pediat Hematol Oncol, Childrens Hosp, Boston, MA 02115 USA; Univ Colorado, Boulder Lab 3D Elect Microscopy Cells, Boulder, CO 80309 USA","Pellman, D (reprint author), Dana Farber Canc Inst, Dept Pediat Oncol, Boston, MA 02115 USA.",david_pellman@dfci.harvard.edu,,"Dunn, Joshua/0000-0003-4476-7257; Storchova, Zuzana/0000-0003-2376-7047",,,,47,185,193,2,15,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,5-Oct,2006,443,7111,,,,,541,547,,10.1038/nature05178,,7,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,090XO,WOS:000240988200036,17024086,No,,,11/20/17

In the Earth's magnetosphere, electron energies reach hundreds of thousands of electron volts (refs 1 - 3), whereas the typical electron energies associated with large-scale reconnection-driven flows are just a few electron volts. Recent observations further suggest that these energetic particles are produced in the region where the magnetic field reconnects(4). In solar flares, upwards of 50 per cent of the energy released can appear as energetic electrons(5,6). Here we show that electrons gain kinetic energy by reflecting from the ends of the contracting 'magnetic islands' that form as reconnection proceeds. The mechanism is analogous to the increase of energy of a ball reflecting between two converging walls - the ball gains energy with each bounce. The repetitive interaction of electrons with many islands allows large numbers to be efficiently accelerated to high energy. The back pressure of the energetic electrons throttles reconnection so that the electron energy gain is a large fraction of the released magnetic energy. The resultant energy spectra of electrons take the form of power laws with spectral indices that match the magnetospheric observations.","Univ Maryland, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; USN, Res Lab, Div Plasma Phys, Washington, DC 20375 USA; Univ Delaware, Newark, DE 19716 USA","Drake, JF (reprint author), Univ Maryland, College Pk, MD 20742 USA.",drake@plasma.umd.edu,"Shay, Michael/G-5476-2013; Drake, James/P-9477-2017; Swisdak, Michael/R-1352-2017","Drake, James/0000-0002-9150-1841; Swisdak, Michael/0000-0002-5435-3544",,,,22,389,395,2,23,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,5-Oct,2006,443,7111,,,,,553,556,,10.1038/nature05116,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,090XO,WOS:000240988200038,17024088,No,,,11/20/17

Teleportation was first demonstrated as a transfer of a quantum state of light onto another light beam(4-6); later developments used optical relays(7) and demonstrated entanglement swapping for continuous variables(8). The teleportation of a quantum state between two single material particles ( trapped ions) has now also been achieved(9,10). Here we demonstrate teleportation between objects of a different nature - light and matter, which respectively represent 'flying' and 'stationary' media. A quantum state encoded in a light pulse is teleported onto a macroscopic object (an atomic ensemble containing 10(12) caesium atoms). Deterministic teleportation is achieved for sets of coherent states with mean photon number (n) up to a few hundred. The fidelities are 0.58 +/- 0.02 for n = 20 and 0.60 +/- 0.02 for n = 5 5 - higher than any classical state transfer can possibly achieve(11). Besides being of fundamental interest, teleportation using a macroscopic atomic ensemble is relevant for the practical implementation of a quantum repeater(2). An important factor for the implementation of quantum networks is the teleportation distance between transmitter and receiver; this is 0.5 metres in the present experiment. As our experiment uses propagating light to achieve the entanglement of light and atoms required for teleportation, the present approach should be scalable to longer distances.","Univ Copenhagen, Niels Bohr Inst, DK-2100 Copenhagen O, Denmark; Max Planck Inst Quantum Opt, D-85748 Garching, Germany; Aarhus Univ, Dept Phys & Astron, DK-8000 Aarhus, Denmark","Polzik, ES (reprint author), Univ Copenhagen, Niels Bohr Inst, Blegdamsvej 17, DK-2100 Copenhagen O, Denmark.",polzik@nbi.dk,"Hammerer, Klemens/C-3538-2008; Cirac, Ignacio/A-9105-2017","Hammerer, Klemens/0000-0002-7179-0666; Polzik, Eugene/0000-0001-9859-6591",,,,25,294,299,5,53,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,5-Oct,2006,443,7111,,,,,557,560,,10.1038/nature05136,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,090XO,WOS:000240988200039,17024089,No,,,11/20/17

The balance between cold meltwater from the north and warm, salty subtropical gyre waters from the south influenced the strength and location of North Atlantic overturning circulation during this period of highly variable climate(3-5). Here we investigate how rapid reorganizations of the ocean atmosphere system across these cycles are linked to salinity changes in the subtropical North Atlantic gyre. We combine Mg/Ca palaeothermometry and oxygen isotope ratio measurements on planktonic foraminifera across four Dansgaard - Oeschger cycles (spanning 45.9 - 59.2 kyr ago) to generate a seawater salinity proxy record from a subtropical gyre deep-sea sediment core. We show that North Atlantic gyre surface salinities oscillated rapidly between saltier stadial conditions and fresher interstadials, covarying with inferred shifts in the Tropical Atlantic hydrologic cycle(6) and North Atlantic overturning circulation. These salinity oscillations suggest a reduction in precipitation into the North Atlantic and/or reduced export of deep salty thermohaline waters during stadials. We hypothesize that increased stadial salinities preconditioned the North Atlantic Ocean for a rapid return to deep overturning circulation and high-latitude warming by contributing to increased North Atlantic surface-water density on interstadial transitions.","Univ Calif Davis, Dept Geol, Davis, CA 95616 USA; Univ Cambridge, Godwin Lab Palaeoclimate Res, Cambridge CB2 3EQ, England","Schmidt, MW (reprint author), Georgia Inst Technol, Sch Earth & Atmospher Sci, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA.",mschmidt@eas.gatech.edu,,"Spero, Howard/0000-0001-5465-8607; Mleneck-Vautravers, Maryline/0000-0003-2534-219X",,,,30,55,59,1,21,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,5-Oct,2006,443,7111,,,,,561,564,,10.1038/nature05121,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,090XO,WOS:000240988200040,17024090,No,,,11/20/17

Yet increasingly, problems have been noted with this model(2,3). The debate can be definitively addressed using stable isotope ratios, which should only significantly vary in primitive, mantle-derived materials as a consequence of recycling. Here we present data showing a notable range in lithium isotope ratios in basalts from the East Pacific Rise, which correlate with traditional indices of mantle heterogeneity (for example, Nd-143/Nd-144 ratios). Such co-variations of stable and radiogenic isotopes in melts from a normal ridge segment provide critical evidence for the importance of recycled material in generating chemical heterogeneity in the upper mantle. Contrary to many models, however, the elevated lithium isotope ratios of the 'enriched' East Pacific Rise lavas imply that subducted ocean crust is not the agent of enrichment. Instead, we suggest that fluid-modified mantle, which is enriched during residency in a subduction zone, is mixed back into the upper mantle to cause compositional variability.","Univ Bristol, Bristol Isotope Grp, Dept Earth Sci, Bristol BS8 1RJ, Avon, England; Univ Oxford, Dept Earth Sci, Oxford OX1 3PR, England; Univ Durham, Dept Earth Sci, Durham DH1 3LE, England","Elliott, T (reprint author), Univ Bristol, Bristol Isotope Grp, Dept Earth Sci, Wills Mem Bldg,Queens Rd, Bristol BS8 1RJ, Avon, England.",tim.elliott@bris.ac.uk,"Thomas, Alex/D-1028-2012; Niu, Yaoling/A-5448-2008","Thomas, Alex/0000-0002-0734-9593; Niu, Yaoling/0000-0001-9488-2304",,,,30,114,123,2,30,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,5-Oct,2006,443,7111,,,,,565,568,,10.1038/nature05144,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,090XO,WOS:000240988200041,17024091,No,,,11/20/17

The bacterium Deinococcus radiodurans is the best known extremophile among the few organisms that can survive extremely high exposures to desiccation and ionizing radiation, which shatter its genome into hundreds of short DNA fragments(2-5). Remarkably, these fragments are readily reassembled into a functional 3.28-megabase genome. Here we describe the relevant two-stage DNA repair process, which involves a previously unknown molecular mechanism for fragment reassembly called 'extended synthesis-dependent strand annealing' (ESDSA), followed and completed by crossovers. At least two genome copies and random DNA breakage are requirements for effective ESDSA. In ESDSA, chromosomal fragments with overlapping homologies are used both as primers and as templates for massive synthesis of complementary single strands, as occurs in a single-round multiplex polymerase chain reaction. This synthesis depends on DNA polymerase I and incorporates more nucleotides than does normal replication in intact cells. Newly synthesized complementary single-stranded extensions become 'sticky ends' that anneal with high precision, joining together contiguous DNA fragments into long, linear, double-stranded intermediates. These intermediates require RecA-dependent crossovers to mature into circular chromosomes that comprise double-stranded patchworks of numerous DNA blocks synthesized before radiation, connected by DNA blocks synthesized after radiation.","Univ Paris 05, Fac Med, INSERM, F-75015 Paris, France; Rudjer Boskovic Inst, Div Mol Biol, Zagreb 10002, Croatia; Univ Paris 11, Inst Genet & Microbiol, CNRS, CEA,UMR8621, F-91405 Orsay, France; Ctr Univ Paris Sud, Inst Curie, Sect Rech, CNRS,UMR 2027, F-91405 Orsay, France; Mediterranean Inst Life Sci, Split 21000, Croatia","Radman, M (reprint author), Univ Paris 05, Fac Med, INSERM, Site Necker,U571,156 Rue Vaugirard, F-75015 Paris, France.",radman@necker.fr,"Lindner, Ariel/I-8503-2016","Lindner, Ariel/0000-0001-5015-6511",,,,29,228,244,6,45,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,5-Oct,2006,443,7111,,,,,569,573,,10.1038/nature05160,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,090XO,WOS:000240988200042,17006450,No,,,11/20/17

Alleles at adjacent MHC loci are often in strong linkage disequilibrium; however, little is known about the mechanisms responsible for this linkage disequilibrium. Here we report that the human MHC HLA-DR2 haplotype, which predisposes to multiple sclerosis(1-3), shows more extensive linkage disequilibrium than other common caucasian HLA haplotypes in the DR region and thus seems likely to have been maintained through positive selection. Characterization of two multiple-sclerosis-associated HLA-DR alleles at separate loci by a functional assay in humanized mice indicates that the linkage disequilibrium between the two alleles may be due to a functional epistatic interaction, whereby one allele modifies the T-cell response activated by the second allele through activation-induced cell death. This functional epistasis is associated with a milder form of multiple-sclerosis-like disease. Such epistatic interaction might prove to be an important general mechanism for modifying exuberant immune responses that are deleterious to the host and could also help to explain the strong linkage disequilibrium in this and perhaps other HLA haplotypes.","Aarhus Univ Hosp, Dept Clin Immunol, DK-8200 Aarhus N, Denmark; Univ Oxford, MRC Human Immunol Unit, Weatherall Inst Mol Med, John Radcliffe Hosp, Oxford OX3 9DS, England; Univ Oxford, Wellcome Trust Ctr Human Genet, Oxford OX3 7BN, England; Univ Copenhagen Hosp, Dept Clin Immunol, Rigshosp, DK-2100 Copenhagen O, Denmark; Univ Copenhagen, Inst Med Microbiol & Immunol, DK-2200 Copenhagen N, Denmark; Univ Oxford, Off Regius Prof Med, Oxford OX3 7BN, England","Fugger, L (reprint author), Aarhus Univ Hosp, Dept Clin Immunol, Skejby Sygehus, DK-8200 Aarhus N, Denmark.",lars.fugger@imm.ox.ac.uk,"Kranc, Kamil/B-3449-2009; Ke, Xiayi/C-7674-2009","Thomsen, Allan Randrup/0000-0002-2392-9803",Medical Research Council [MC_U137881016],,,27,116,117,0,9,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,5-Oct,2006,443,7111,,,,,574,577,,10.1038/nature05133,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,090XO,WOS:000240988200043,17006452,No,,,11/20/17

Modern histopathological analysis of autopsy samples from human influenza cases from 1918 revealed significant damage to the lungs with acute, focal bronchitis and alveolitis associated with massive pulmonary oedema, haemorrhage and rapid destruction of the respiratory epithelium(2). The contribution of the host immune response leading to this severe pathology remains largely unknown. Here we show, in a comprehensive analysis of the global host response induced by the 1918 influenza virus, that mice infected with the reconstructed 1918 influenza virus displayed an increased and accelerated activation of host immune response genes associated with severe pulmonary pathology. We found that mice infected with a virus containing all eight genes from the pandemic virus showed marked activation of pro-inflammatory and cell-death pathways by 24 h after infection that remained unabated until death on day 5. This was in contrast with smaller host immune responses as measured at the genomic level, accompanied by less severe disease pathology and delays in death in mice infected with influenza viruses containing only subsets of 1918 genes. The results indicate a cooperative interaction between the 1918 influenza genes and show that study of the virulence of the 1918 influenza virus requires the use of the fully reconstructed virus. With recent concerns about the introduction of highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses into humans and their potential to cause a worldwide pandemic with disastrous health and economic consequences, a comprehensive understanding of the global host response to the 1918 virus is crucial. Moreover, understanding the contribution of host immune responses to virulent influenza virus infections is an important starting point for the identification of prognostic indicators and the development of novel antiviral therapies.","Univ Washington, Sch Med, Dept Microbiol, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; NCID, Influenza Branch, DVRD, Ctr Dis Control & Prevent, Atlanta, GA 30333 USA; Washington Natl Primate Res Ctr, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; CUNY Mt Sinai Sch Med, Dept Microbiol, New York, NY 10029 USA; Armed Forces Inst Pathol, Dept Mol Pathol, Dept Cellular Pathol & Genet, Rockville, MD 20850 USA; USDA, SE Poultry Res Lab, Agr Res Lab, Athens, GA 30606 USA","Kash, JC (reprint author), Univ Washington, Sch Med, Dept Microbiol, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.",jkash@u.washington.edu,,"Palese, Peter/0000-0002-0337-5823; Garcia-Sastre, Adolfo/0000-0002-6551-1827",Intramural NIH HHS [Z01 AI000986-01],,,26,358,374,0,20,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,5-Oct,2006,443,7111,,,,,578,581,,10.1038/nature05181,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,090XO,WOS:000240988200044,17006449,No,,,11/20/17

This results in a progressive increase in the concentration of Na(+) in the erythrocyte cytosol(2,3). The parasite cytosol has a relatively low Na(+) concentration(2,4) and there is therefore a large inward Na(+) gradient across the parasite plasma membrane. Here we show that the parasite exploits the Na(+) electrochemical gradient to energize the uptake of inorganic phosphate (P(i)), an essential nutrient. P(i) was taken up into the intracellular parasite by a Na(+)-dependent transporter, with a stoichiometry of 2Na(+): 1P(i) and with an apparent preference for the monovalent over the divalent form of P(i). A P(i) transporter (PfPiT) belonging to the PiT family was cloned from the parasite and localized to the parasite surface. Expression of PfPiT in Xenopus oocytes resulted in Na(+)-dependent P(i) uptake with characteristics similar to those observed for P(i) uptake in the parasite.

Transport of porphyrins into isolated mitochondria is energy-dependent(1-3), as expected for the movement of anions into a negatively charged environment. ATP-binding cassette transporters actively facilitate the transmembrane movement of substances. We found that the mitochondrial ATP-binding cassette transporter ABCB6 is upregulated ( messenger RNA and protein in human and mouse cells) by elevation of cellular porphyrins and postulated that ABCB6 has a function in porphyrin transport. We also predicted that ABCB6 is functionally linked to haem biosynthesis, because its mRNA is found in both human bone marrow and CD71(+) early erythroid cells ( by database searching), and because our results show that ABCB6 is highly expressed in human fetal liver, and Abcb6 in mouse embryonic liver. Here we demonstrate that ABCB6 is uniquely located in the outer mitochondrial membrane and is required for mitochondrial porphyrin uptake. After ABCB6 is upregulated in response to increased intracellular porphyrin, mitochondrial porphyrin uptake activates de novo porphyrin biosynthesis. This process is blocked when the Abcb6 gene is silenced.

Through a three-enzyme (E1 - E2 - E3) cascade, the attachment of ubiquitin to proteins is catalysed by the E3 ubiquitin ligase, which is best represented by the superfamily of the cullin-RING complexes(2,3). Conserved from yeast to human, the DDB1 - CUL4 - ROC1 complex is a recently identified cullin-RING ubiquitin ligase, which regulates DNA repair(4-10), DNA replication(11-14) and transcription(15), and can also be subverted by pathogenic viruses to benefit viral infection(16). Lacking a canonical SKP1-like cullin adaptor and a defined substrate recruitment module, how the DDB1 - CUL4 - ROC1 E3 apparatus is assembled for ubiquitinating various substrates remains unclear. Here we present crystallographic analyses of the virally hijacked form of the human DDB1 - CUL4A - ROC1 machinery, which show that DDB1 uses one beta-propeller domain for cullin scaffold binding and a variably attached separate double-beta-propeller fold for substrate presentation. Through tandem-affinity purification of human DDB1 and CUL4A complexes followed by mass spectrometry analysis, we then identify a novel family of WD40-repeat proteins, which directly bind to the double-propeller fold of DDB1 and serve as the substrate-recruiting module of the E3. Together, our structural and proteomic results reveal the structural mechanisms and molecular logic underlying the assembly and versatility of a new family of cullin-RING E3 complexes.","Univ Washington, Sch Med, Dept Pharmacol, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; Univ Washington, Sch Med, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; Univ Washington, Sch Med, Dept Genome Sci, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; Univ Washington, Sch Med, Inst Stem Cell & Regenerat Med, Seattle, WA 98195 USA","Zheng, N (reprint author), Univ Washington, Sch Med, Dept Pharmacol, Box 357280, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.",rtmoon@u.washington.edu; nzheng@u.washington.edu,"Angers, Stephane/E-1432-2014; Moon, Randall/B-1743-2014","Angers, Stephane/0000-0001-7241-9044; Moon, Randall/0000-0002-9352-1408",,,,26,324,350,1,21,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,5-Oct,2006,443,7111,,,,,590,593,,10.1038/nature05175,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,090XO,WOS:000240988200047,16964240,No,,,11/20/17

Our comparative analysis of several large-scale data sets reveals that although the regulated subunits of each protein complex are expressed just before its time of action, the identity of the periodically expressed proteins differs significantly between organisms. Moreover, we show that these changes in transcriptional regulation have co-evolved with post-translational control independently in several lineages; loss or gain of cell-cycle-regulated transcription of specific genes is often mirrored by changes in phosphorylation of the proteins that they encode.

BEC has, for example, famously been demonstrated in dilute atom gas of rubidium atoms at temperatures below 200 nanokelvin. Much effort has been devoted to finding a solid-state system in which BEC can take place. Promising candidate systems are semiconductor microcavities, in which photons are confined and strongly coupled to electronic excitations, leading to the creation of exciton polaritons. These bosonic quasi-particles are 10 9 times lighter than rubidium atoms, thus theoretically permitting BEC to occur at standard cryogenic temperatures. Here we detail a comprehensive set of experiments giving compelling evidence for BEC of polaritons. Above a critical density, we observe massive occupation of the ground state developing from a polariton gas at thermal equilibrium at 19 K, an increase of temporal coherence, and the build-up of long-range spatial coherence and linear polarization, all of which indicate the spontaneous onset of a macroscopic quantum phase.","Ecole Polytech Fed Lausanne, Stn 3, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland; Univ Grenoble 1, Spectrometrie Phys Lab, CEA CNRS UJF Joint Grp Nanophys & Semicond, CNRS,UMR5588, F-38402 St Martin Dheres, France; MIT, Dept Phys, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; Univ Cambridge, Cavendish Lab, Dept Phys, Cambridge CB3 0HE, England; Univ Oxford, Dept Phys, Clarendon Lab, Oxford OX1 3PU, England","Deveaud, B (reprint author), Ecole Polytech Fed Lausanne, Stn 3, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland.",jkasprz@spectro.ujf-grenoble.fr; benoit.deveaud-pledran@epfl.ch,"Keeling, Jonathan/B-7827-2008; Savona, Vincenzo/A-8847-2010; Cavendish, TCM/C-9489-2009; Littlewood, Peter/B-7746-2008; Deveaud, Benoit/A-4782-2013; Deveaud, Benoit/N-1947-2014; Marchetti, Francesca Maria/F-7695-2012; maxime, richard/S-4963-2016; Andre, Regis/M-4629-2014","Keeling, Jonathan/0000-0002-4283-552X; Deveaud, Benoit/0000-0002-9776-6314; Deveaud, Benoit/0000-0002-9776-6314; Marchetti, Francesca Maria/0000-0003-1394-7394; maxime, richard/0000-0001-9596-2891; Andre, Regis/0000-0003-3035-4291",,,,41,1392,1397,21,265,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,28-Sep,2006,443,7110,,,,,409,414,,10.1038/nature05131,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,088FY,WOS:000240798800036,17006506,No,,,11/20/17

Here, we analyse the evolution of a combinatorial transcriptional circuit composed of sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins that are conserved among all eukaryotes. This circuit regulates mating in the ascomycete yeast lineage. We first identify a group of mating genes that was transcriptionally regulated by an activator in a fungal ancestor, but is now transcriptionally regulated by a repressor in modern bakers' yeast. Despite this change in regulatory mechanism, the logical output of the overall circuit remains the same. By examining the regulation of mating in modern yeasts that are related to different extents, we deduce specific, sequential changes in both cis- and trans-regulatory elements that constitute the transition from positive to negative regulation. These changes indicate specific mechanisms by which fitness barriers were traversed during the transition.","Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Biochem & Biophys, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Microbiol & Immunol, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA","Johnson, AD (reprint author), Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Biochem & Biophys, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA.",ajohnson@cgl.ucsf.edu,,,,,,47,185,194,2,15,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,28-Sep,2006,443,7110,,,,,415,420,,10.1038/nature05099,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,088FY,WOS:000240798800037,17006507,No,,,11/20/17

But for stars similar to 10 times more massive than the Sun (similar to 10M(.)), the powerful stellar radiation is expected to inhibit accretion1 and thus limit the growth of their mass. Clearly, stars with masses > 10M(.) exist, so there must be a way for them to form. The problem may be solved by non-spherical accretion(2,3), which allows some of the stellar photons to escape along the symmetry axis where the density is lower. The recent detection of rotating disks(4-6) and toroids(7) around very young massive stars has lent support to the idea that high- mass (greater than or similar to 8M(.)) stars could formin this way. Here we report observations of an ammonia line towards a high- mass star forming region.

It involves the formation of a collective quantum state composed of identical particles with integer angular momentum (bosons), if the particle density exceeds a critical value. To achieve Bose - Einstein condensation, one can either decrease the temperature or increase the density of bosons. It has been predicted(3,4) that a quasi-equilibrium system of bosons could undergo Bose - Einstein condensation even at relatively high temperatures, if the flow rate of energy pumped into the system exceeds a critical value. Here we report the observation of Bose - Einstein condensation in a gas of magnons at room temperature. Magnons are the quanta of magnetic excitations in a magnetically ordered ensemble of magnetic moments. In thermal equilibrium, they can be described by Bose - Einstein statistics with zero chemical potential and a temperature-dependent density. In the experiments presented here, we show that by using a technique of microwave pumping it is possible to excite additional magnons and to create a gas of quasi-equilibrium magnons with a non-zero chemical potential. With increasing pumping intensity, the chemical potential reaches the energy of the lowest magnon state, and a Bose condensate of magnons is formed.","Univ Munster, Inst Appl Phys, D-48149 Munster, Germany; Natl Taras Schevchenko Univ Kiev, Dept Radiophys, UA-01033 Kiev, Ukraine; Tech Univ Kaiserslautern, Fachbereich Phys, D-67663 Kaiserslautern, Germany; Oakland Univ, Dept Phys, Rochester, MI 48309 USA","Demokritov, SO (reprint author), Univ Munster, Inst Appl Phys, D-48149 Munster, Germany.",demokrit@uni-muenster.de,"Hillebrands, Burkard/C-6242-2008; Demokritov, Sergej/C-4347-2013; Serga, Alexander/J-4646-2017","Hillebrands, Burkard/0000-0001-8910-0355; Demokritov, Sergej/0000-0003-4422-4201; Serga, Alexander/0000-0003-2634-8569",,,,27,341,343,4,79,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,28-Sep,2006,443,7110,,,,,430,433,,10.1038/nature05117,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,088FY,WOS:000240798800040,17006509,No,,,11/20/17

For example, this has been established for simple shear flows, where no pressure change is associated with flow: there is no volume deformation due to viscous stress and inertial effects can be neglected. Accordingly, any flow-induced instabilities ( such as cavitation) are unexpected for simple shear flows. Here we demonstrate that the incompressibility condition can be violated even for simple shear flows, by taking into account the coupling between the flow and density fluctuations, which arises owing to the density dependence of the viscosity. We show that a liquid can become mechanically unstable above a critical shear rate that is given by the inverse of the derivative of viscosity with respect to pressure. Our model predicts that, for very viscous liquids, this shear-induced instability should occur at moderate shear rates that are experimentally accessible. Our results explain the unusual shear-induced instability observed in viscous lubricants(3-5), and may illuminate other poorly understood phenomena associated with mechanical instability of liquids at low Reynolds number; for example, shear-induced cavitation and bubble growth(6), and shear-banding of very viscous liquids such as metallic glasses(7) and the Earth's mantle(8).","Univ Tokyo, Inst Ind Sci, Tokyo 1538505, Japan","Furukawa, A (reprint author), Univ Tokyo, Inst Ind Sci, 4-6-1 Komaba, Tokyo 1538505, Japan.",furu@iis.u-tokyo.ac.jp,"Tanaka, Hajime/A-9653-2008; Furukawa, Akira/C-8629-2009","Tanaka, Hajime/0000-0002-4444-1890; ",,,,30,26,26,3,40,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,28-Sep,2006,443,7110,,,,,434,438,,10.1038/nature05119,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,088FY,WOS:000240798800041,17006510,No,,,11/20/17

The growth rate of atmospheric methane is determined by the balance between surface emissions and photochemical destruction by the hydroxyl radical, the major atmospheric oxidant. Remarkably, this growth rate has decreased(2) markedly since the early 1990s, and the level of methane has remained relatively constant since 1999, leading to a downward revision of its projected influence on global temperatures. Large fluctuations in the growth rate of atmospheric methane are also observed from one year to the next(2), but their causes remain uncertain(2-13). Here we quantify the processes that controlled variations in methane emissions between 1984 and 2003 using an inversion model of atmospheric transport and chemistry. Our results indicate that wetland emissions dominated the inter-annual variability of methane sources, whereas fire emissions played a smaller role, except during the 1997 - 1998 El Nino event. These top-down estimates of changes in wetland and fire emissions are in good agreement with independent estimates based on remote sensing information and biogeochemical models. On longer timescales, our results show that the decrease in atmospheric methane growth during the 1990s was caused by a decline in anthropogenic emissions. Since 1999, however, they indicate that anthropogenic emissions of methane have risen again. The effect of this increase on the growth rate of atmospheric methane has been masked by a coincident decrease in wetland emissions, but atmospheric methane levels may increase in the near future if wetland emissions return to their mean 1990s levels.","UVSQ, CNRS, CEA, IPSL,LSCE, F-91191 Gif Sur Yvette, France; Univ Versailles, F-78035 Versailles, France; NOAA, Earth Syst Res Lab, Global Monitoring Div, Boulder, CO 80305 USA; Univ Colorado, Cooperat Inst Res Environm Sci, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; Observ Paris, LERMA, F-75014 Paris, France; Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Fac Earth & Life Sci, Amsterdam, Netherlands; LBI, F-78026 Versailles, France; S African Weather Serv, ZA-7599 Stellenbosch, South Africa; CSIRO, Mordialloc, Vic 3195, Australia; Columbia Univ, NASA, GISS, New York, NY 10025 USA; Univ Calif Irvine, Earth Syst Sci Dept, Irvine, CA 92697 USA; Univ Colorado, Inst Arctic & Alpine Res, Boulder, CO 80309 USA","Bousquet, P (reprint author), UVSQ, CNRS, CEA, IPSL,LSCE, F-91191 Gif Sur Yvette, France.",philippe.bousquet@cea.fr,"; Steele, Paul/B-3185-2009; Papa, Fabrice/D-3695-2009; White, James/A-7845-2009; Carouge, Claire/A-4755-2012; Langenfelds, Raymond/B-5381-2012; Vuichard, Nicolas/A-6629-2011; van der Werf, Guido/M-8260-2016; Hauglustaine, Didier/A-4154-2012","Peylin, Philippe/0000-0001-9335-6994; Bousquet, Philippe/0000-0002-4444-2703; Steele, Paul/0000-0002-8234-3730; Papa, Fabrice/0000-0001-6305-6253; White, James/0000-0001-6041-4684; Carouge, Claire/0000-0002-0313-8385; van der Werf, Guido/0000-0001-9042-8630; ",,,,33,446,473,11,211,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,28-Sep,2006,443,7110,,,,,439,443,,10.1038/nature05132,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,088FY,WOS:000240798800042,17006511,No,,,11/20/17

Seven of the nine countries with territory in the Amazon basin and the Guiana shield have carried out large-scale forest inventories, but such massive data sets have been little exploited by tropical plant ecologists(5-8). Although forest inventories often lack the species-level identifications favoured by tropical plant ecologists, their consistency of measurement and vast spatial coverage make them ideally suited for numerical analyses at large scales, and a valuable resource to describe the still poorly understood spatial variation of biomass, diversity, community composition and forest functioning across the South American tropics(9).

It has been proposed that this is at least partially caused by the senescence of progenitors with age(3,4); however, it has not yet been tested whether genes associated with senescence functionally contribute to physiological declines in progenitor activity. Here we show that progenitor proliferation in the subventricular zone and neurogenesis in the olfactory bulb, as well as multipotent progenitor frequency and self-renewal potential, all decline with age in the mouse forebrain. These declines in progenitor frequency and function correlate with increased expression of p16(INK4a), which encodes a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor linked to senescence(5). Ageing p16(INK4a)-deficient mice showed a significantly smaller decline in subventricular zone proliferation, olfactory bulb neurogenesis, and the frequency and self-renewal potential of multipotent progenitors. p16(INK4a) deficiency did not detectably affect progenitor function in the dentate gyrus or enteric nervous system, indicating regional differences in the response of neural progenitors to increased p16(INK4a) expression during ageing. Declining subventricular zone progenitor function and olfactory bulb neurogenesis during ageing are thus caused partly by increasing p16(INK4a) expression.","Univ Michigan, Dept Internal Med, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; Univ Michigan, Ctr Stem Cell Biol, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; Univ N Carolina, Sch Med, Lineberger Comprehens Canc Ctr, Dept Med, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA; Univ N Carolina, Sch Med, Lineberger Comprehens Canc Ctr, Dept Genet, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA","Morrison, SJ (reprint author), Univ Michigan, Dept Internal Med, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",seanjm@umich.edu,"Pardal, Ricardo/C-4370-2015; IBIS, FISIOPATOLOGIA/O-9510-2015","Pardal, Ricardo/0000-0003-1085-0714; He, Shenghui/0000-0001-8842-7137; Morrison, Sean/0000-0003-1587-8329","NIA NIH HHS [R01 AG024945, R01 AG024945-01, R01 AG024945-02, R01 AG024945-03, R01 AG024945-03S1, R01 AG024945-04, R01 AG024945-05]",,,30,551,593,3,24,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,28-Sep,2006,443,7110,,,,,448,452,,10.1038/nature05091,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,088FY,WOS:000240798800044,16957738,No,,,11/20/17

Here we show that p16(INK4a) constrains islet proliferation and regeneration in an age-dependent manner. Expression of the p16(INK4a) transcript is enriched in purified islets compared with the exocrine pancreas, and islet-specific expression of p16(INK4a), but not other cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors, increases markedly with ageing. To determine the physiological significance of p16(INK4a) accumulation on islet function, we assessed the impact of p16(INK4a) deficiency and overexpression with increasing age and in the regenerative response after exposure to a specific beta-cell toxin. Transgenic mice that overexpress p16(INK4a) to a degree seen with ageing demonstrated decreased islet proliferation. Similarly, islet proliferation was unaffected by p16(INK4a) deficiency in young mice, but was relatively increased in p16(INK4a)-deficient old mice. Survival after toxin-mediated ablation of beta-cells, which requires islet proliferation, declined with advancing age; however, mice lacking p16(INK4a) demonstrated enhanced islet proliferation and survival after beta-cell ablation. These genetic data support the view that an age-induced increase of p16(INK4a) expression limits the regenerative capacity of beta-cells with ageing.","Univ N Carolina, Sch Med, Lineberger Comprehens Canc Ctr, Dept Med, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA; Univ N Carolina, Sch Med, Lineberger Comprehens Canc Ctr, Dept Genet, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA; Brigham & Womens Hosp, Dept Pathol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Boston, MA 02115 USA; Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Joslin Diabet Ctr, Boston, MA 02115 USA","Sharpless, NE (reprint author), Univ N Carolina, Sch Med, Lineberger Comprehens Canc Ctr, Dept Med, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA.",NES@med.unc.edu,,"Ligon, Keith/0000-0002-7733-600X; Bonner-Weir, Susan/0000-0003-4682-0656",,,,32,538,568,4,34,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,28-Sep,2006,443,7110,,,,,453,457,,10.1038/nature05092,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,088FY,WOS:000240798800045,16957737,No,,,11/20/17

However, whether this reflects direct feedback or merely parallel inputs on common targets is unclear. Here we show that in Arabidopsis roots, this interaction is mediated by BREVIS RADIX (BRX), which is required for optimal root growth(4). We demonstrate that the brx phenotype results from a root-specific deficiency of brassinosteroid and is due to reduced, BRX-dependent expression of a rate-limiting enzyme in brassinosteroid biosynthesis. Unexpectedly, this deficiency affects the root expression level of similar to 15% of all Arabidopsis genes, but the transcriptome profile can be restored to wild type by brassinosteroid treatment. Thus, proper brassinosteroid levels are required for the correct expression of many more genes than previously suspected. Moreover, embryonic or post-embryonic brassinosteroid application fully or partially, respectively, rescues the brx phenotype. Further, auxin-responsive gene expression is globally impaired in brx, demonstrating that brassinosteroid levels are rate-limiting for auxin-responsive transcription. BRX expression is strongly induced by auxin and mildly repressed by brassinolide, which means that BRX acts at the nexus of a feedback loop that maintains threshold brassinosteroid levels to permit optimal auxin action.","Univ Lausanne, Dept Plant Mol Biol, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland","Hardtke, CS (reprint author), Univ Lausanne, Dept Plant Mol Biol, Biophore Bldg, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland.",christian.hardtke@unil.ch,"Hardtke, Christian/B-5861-2009","Hardtke, Christian/0000-0003-3203-1058",,,,30,142,152,0,27,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,28-Sep,2006,443,7110,,,,,458,461,,10.1038/nature05130,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,088FY,WOS:000240798800046,17006513,No,,,11/20/17

On contact with the target cell, the microtubule organizing centre of the CTL polarizes towards the target(2,3) and granules move along microtubules in a minus-end direction towards the polarized microtubule organizing centre. However, the final steps of secretion have remained unclear. Here we show that CTLs do not require actin or plus-end microtubule motors for secretion, but instead the centrosome moves to and contacts the plasma membrane at the central supramolecular activation cluster of the immunological synapse. Actin and IQGAP1 are cleared away from the synapse, and granules are delivered directly to the plasma membrane.

Septins form filaments as pure protein(8) and in vivo(9), but the filament organization within the hourglass and ring structures is controversial(9,10). Here, we use polarized fluorescence microscopy(11) of orientationally constrained green fluorescent protein to determine septin filament organization and dynamics in living yeast. We found that the hourglass is made of filaments aligned along the yeast bud neck. During the transition from hourglass to rings the filaments rotate through 90 degrees in the membrane plane and become circumferential.

They provide a polar transmembrane pathway, to which access is strictly controlled by coupled gates that are constrained to open alternately, thereby enabling thermodynamically uphill ion transport ( for example, see ref. 1). Here we examine the ion pathway through the Na+, K+-ATPase, a representative P-type pump, after uncoupling its extra- and intracellular gates with the marine toxin palytoxin(2). We use small hydrophilic thiol-specific reagents(3) as extracellular probes and we monitor their reactions, and the consequences, with cysteine residues introduced along the anticipated cation pathway through the pump. The distinct effects of differently charged reagents indicate that a wide outer vestibule penetrates deep into the Na+, K+-ATPase, where the pathway narrows and leads to a charge-selectivity filter. Acidic residues in this region, which are conserved to coordinate pumped ions, allow the approach of cations but exclude anions. Reversing the charge at just one of those positions converts the pathway from cation selective to anion selective. Close structural homology among the catalytic subunits of Ca2+-, Na+, K+- and H+, K+-ATPases(4-6) argues that their extracytosolic cation exchange pathways all share these physical characteristics.","Rockefeller Univ, Lab Cardiac Membrane Physiol, New York, NY 10021 USA","Gadsby, DC (reprint author), Rockefeller Univ, Lab Cardiac Membrane Physiol, 1230 York Ave, New York, NY 10021 USA.",gadsby@rockefeller.edu,,"Reyes, Nicolas/0000-0001-6618-8307",,,,30,50,54,2,17,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,28-Sep,2006,443,7110,,,,,470,474,,10.1038/nature05129,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,088FY,WOS:000240798800049,17006516,No,,,11/20/17

There is a consensus that type Ia supernovae are thermonuclear explosions that destroy carbon - oxygen white dwarf stars that have accreted matter from a companion star(3), although the nature of this companion remains uncertain. These supernovae are thought to be reliable distance indicators because they have a standard amount of fuel and a uniform trigger: they are predicted to explode when the mass of the white dwarf nears the Chandrase-khar mass(4) of 1.4 solar masses (M-.). Here we show that the high-redshift supernova SNLS-03D3bb has an exceptionally high luminosity and low kinetic energy that both imply a super-Chandrasekhar-mass progenitor. Super-Chandrasekhar-mass supernovae should occur preferentially in a young stellar population, so this may provide an explanation for the observed trend that overluminous type Ia supernovae occur only in 'young' environments(5,6). As this supernova does not obey the relations that allow type Ia supernovae to be calibrated as standard candles, and as no counterparts have been found at low redshift, future cosmology studies will have to consider possible contamination from such events.","Univ Toronto, Dept Astron & Astrophys, Toronto, ON M5S 3H8, Canada; Univ Calif Berkeley, Lawrence Berkeley Lab, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; CALTECH, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA; CEA Saclay, Serv Astrophys, DAPNIA, F-91191 Gif Sur Yvette, France; CNRS, IN2P3, LPNHE, F-75005 Paris, France; Univ Paris 06, F-75005 Paris, France; Univ Paris 07, F-75005 Paris, France; Univ Victoria, Dept Phys & Astron, Victoria, BC V8W 3P6, Canada; CNRS, LAM, F-13376 Marseille 12, France; CNRS, IN2P3, CPPM, F-13288 Marseille 9, France; Univ Aix Marseille 2, F-13288 Marseille 9, France; Univ Oxford, Oxford OX1 3RH, England","Howell, DA (reprint author), Univ Toronto, Dept Astron & Astrophys, 60 St George St, Toronto, ON M5S 3H8, Canada.",howell@astro.utoronto.ca,"Carlberg, Raymond/I-6947-2012","Carlberg, Raymond/0000-0002-7667-0081; Nugent, Peter/0000-0002-3389-0586; Sullivan, Mark/0000-0001-9053-4820",,,,30,270,271,0,14,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,21-Sep,2006,443,7109,,,,,308,311,,10.1038/nature05103,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,085RL,WOS:000240622000039,16988705,No,,,11/20/17

For example, gaseous spinor Bose - Einstein condensates(1-3) ( whose atoms have non-zero internal angular momentum) are quantum fluids that simultaneously realize superfluidity and magnetism, both of which are associated with symmetry breaking. Here we explore spontaneous symmetry breaking in (87)Rb spinor condensates, rapidly quenched across a quantum phase transition to a ferromagnetic state. We observe the formation of spin textures, ferromagnetic domains and domain walls, and demonstrate phase-sensitive in situ detection of spin vortices. The latter are topological defects resulting from the symmetry breaking, containing non-zero spin current but no net mass current(4).","Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Phys, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA","Stamper-Kurn, DM (reprint author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Phys, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",dmsk@berkeley.edu,"Vengalattore, Mukund/B-2781-2015; Stamper-Kurn, Dan/B-5442-2015; Leslie, Sabrina/M-3626-2016","Stamper-Kurn, Dan/0000-0002-4845-5835; ",,,,28,559,560,1,53,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,21-Sep,2006,443,7109,,,,,312,315,,10.1038/nature05094,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,085RL,WOS:000240622000040,16988706,No,,,11/20/17

For quantum metrology, the use of entangled states has been discussed(3-5) and demonstrated(6) as a means of improving the signal-to-noise ratio. In addition, entangled states have been used in experiments for efficient quantum state detection(7) and for the measurement of scattering lengths(8). In quantum information processing, manipulation of individual quantum bits allows for the tailored design of specific states that are insensitive to the detrimental influences of an environment(9). Such 'decoherence-free subspaces' ( ref. 10) protect quantum information and yield significantly enhanced coherence times(11). Here we use a decoherence-free subspace with specifically designed entangled states(12) to demonstrate precision spectroscopy of a pair of trapped Ca(+) ions; we obtain the electric quadrupole moment, which is of use for frequency standard applications. We find that entangled states are not only useful for enhancing the signal-to-noise ratio in frequency measurements - a suitably designed pair of atoms also allows clock measurements in the presence of strong technical noise. Our technique makes explicit use of non-locality as an entanglement property and provides an approach for 'designed' quantum metrology.","Univ Innsbruck, Inst Expt Phys, A-6020 Innsbruck, Austria; Austrian Acad Sci, Inst Quantenopt & Quanteninformat, A-6020 Innsbruck, Austria","Roos, CF (reprint author), Univ Innsbruck, Inst Expt Phys, Technikerstr 25, A-6020 Innsbruck, Austria.",christian.roos@uibk.ac.at,"Roos, Christian/D-8475-2011","Roos, Christian/0000-0001-7121-8259",,,,27,179,181,1,37,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,21-Sep,2006,443,7109,,,,,316,319,,10.1038/nature05101,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,085RL,WOS:000240622000041,16988707,No,,,11/20/17

Fluctuations in the equatorial Atlantic are dominated by the Atlantic Nino(2,3), a phenomenon analogous to El Nino, characterized by irregular episodes of anomalous warming during the boreal summer. The Atlantic Nino strongly affects seasonal climate prediction in African countries bordering the Gulf of Guinea(4,5). The relationship between El Nino and the Atlantic Nino is ambiguous and inconsistent. Here we combine observational and modelling analysis to show that the fragile relationship is a result of destructive interference between atmospheric and oceanic processes in response to El Nino. The net effect of El Nino on the Atlantic Nino depends not only on the atmospheric response that propagates the El Nino signal to the tropical Atlantic, but also on a dynamic ocean - atmosphere interaction in the equatorial Atlantic that works against the atmospheric response. These results emphasize the importance of having an improved ocean-observing system in the tropical Atlantic, because our ability to predict the Atlantic Nino will depend not only on our knowledge of conditions in the tropical Pacific, but also on an accurate estimate of the state of the upper ocean in the equatorial Atlantic.","Texas A&M Univ, Dept Oceanog, College Stn, TX 77843 USA; Texas A&M Univ, Dept Atmospher Sci, College Stn, TX 77843 USA","Chang, P (reprint author), Texas A&M Univ, Dept Oceanog, College Stn, TX 77843 USA.",ping@tamu.edu,"Saravanan, Ramalingam/G-8879-2012; Chang, Ping /A-1642-2013","Saravanan, Ramalingam/0000-0002-0005-6907; Chang, Ping /0000-0002-9085-0759",,,,22,77,79,0,12,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,21-Sep,2006,443,7109,,,,,324,328,,10.1038/nature05053,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,085RL,WOS:000240622000043,16988709,No,,,11/20/17

We detect an ice mass loss of 248 +/- 36 km(3) yr(-1), equivalent to a global sea level rise of 0.5 +/- 0.1 mm yr(-1). The rate of ice loss increased by 250 per cent between the periods April 2002 to April 2004 and May 2004 to April 2006, almost entirely due to accelerated rates of ice loss in southern Greenland; the rate of mass loss in north Greenland was almost constant.

This idea was initially conceived as a result of the observation that these two cell types develop in close proximity to each other within the embryo(1,2). Support for this hypothesis was provided by studies on single-cell-derived colonies that can produce both haematopoietic and endothelial cells in vitro(3-7). Although these data point towards the existence of a common progenitor for these two lineages, the presence of a bipotential progenitor cell has yet to be demonstrated in vivo. Through the construction of single-cell-resolution fate maps of the zebrafish late blastula and gastrula, we demonstrate that individual cells can give rise to both haematopoietic and endothelial cells. These bipotential progenitors arise along the entire extent of the ventral mesoderm and contribute solely to haematopoietic and endothelial cells. We also find that only a subset of haematopoietic and endothelial cells arise from haemangioblasts. The endothelial descendants of the haemangioblasts all clustered in a specific region of the axial vessels regardless of the location of their progenitors. Our results provide in vivo evidence supporting the existence of the haemangioblast and reveal distinct features of this cell population.","Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Biochem & Biophys, San Francisco, CA 94158 USA; Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Anat, San Francisco, CA 94158 USA; Univ Calif San Francisco, Cardiovasc Res Inst, San Francisco, CA 94158 USA","Stainier, DYR (reprint author), Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Biochem & Biophys, 1550 4th St, San Francisco, CA 94158 USA.",didier_stainier@biochem.ucsf.edu,,"Stainier, Didier/0000-0002-0382-0026",,,,18,185,189,0,11,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,21-Sep,2006,443,7109,,,,,337,339,,10.1038/nature05045,,3,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,085RL,WOS:000240622000046,16988712,No,,,11/20/17

Here we show that ultraviolet light potently induces expression of MSH in keratinocytes, but fails to stimulate pigmentation in the absence of functional MC1R in red/blonde-haired Mc1r(e/e) mice. However, pigmentation could be rescued by topical application of the cyclic AMP agonist forskolin, without the need for ultraviolet light, demonstrating that the pigmentation machinery is available despite the absence of functional MC1R. This chemically induced pigmentation was protective against ultraviolet-light-induced cutaneous DNA damage and tumorigenesis when tested in the cancer-prone, xerodermapigmentosum-complementation-group- C-deficient genetic background.

Diabetes in patients treated with calcineurin inhibitors such as cyclosporin A indicates that calcineurin/nuclear factor of activated T-cells ( NFAT) signalling might control adaptive islet responses(3), but the roles of this pathway in beta-cells in vivo are not understood. Here we show that mice with a beta-cell-specific deletion of the calcineurin phosphatase regulatory subunit, calcineurin b1 (Cnb1), develop age-dependent diabetes characterized by decreased beta-cell proliferation and mass, reduced pancreatic insulin content and hypoinsulinaemia. Moreover, beta-cells lacking Cnb1 have a reduced expression of established regulators of beta-cell proliferation(1,4,5). Conditional expression of active NFATc1 in Cnb1-deficient beta-cells rescues these defects and prevents diabetes. In normal adult beta-cells, conditional NFAT activation promotes the expression of cell-cycle regulators and increases beta-cell proliferation and mass, resulting in hyperinsulinaemia. Conditional NFAT activation also induces the expression of genes critical for beta-cell endocrine function, including all six genes mutated in hereditary forms of monogenic type 2 diabetes. Thus, calcineurin/ NFAT signalling regulates multiple factors that control growth and hallmark beta-cell functions, revealing unique models for the pathogenesis and therapy of diabetes.","Stanford Univ, Dept Dev Biol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; Stanford Univ, Program Immunol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; Stanford Univ, Dept Microbiol & Immunol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; Stanford Univ, Dept Pathol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; Stanford Univ, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; Stanford Univ, Dept Med, Div Oncol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA","Kim, SK (reprint author), Stanford Univ, Dept Dev Biol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",seungkim@stanford.edu,,,,,,29,227,236,1,8,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,21-Sep,2006,443,7109,,,,,345,349,,10.1038/nature05097,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,085RL,WOS:000240622000048,16988714,No,,,11/20/17

The inhibitory receptor programmed death 1 (PD-1; also known as PDCD1), a negative regulator of activated T cells(1-4), is markedly upregulated on the surface of exhausted virus-specific CD8 T cells in mice(5). Blockade of this pathway using antibodies against the PD ligand 1 (PD-L1, also known as CD274) restores CD8 T-cell function and reduces viral load(5). To investigate the role of PD-1 in a chronic human viral infection, we examined PD-1 expression on human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-specific CD8 T cells in 71 clade-C-infected people who were naive to anti-HIV treatments, using ten major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I tetramers specific for frequently targeted epitopes. Here we report that PD-1 is significantly upregulated on these cells, and expression correlates with impaired HIV-specific CD8 T-cell function as well as predictors of disease progression: positively with plasma viral load and inversely with CD4 T-cell count. PD-1 expression on CD4 T cells likewise showed a positive correlation with viral load and an inverse correlation with CD4 T-cell count, and blockade of the pathway augmented HIV-specific CD4 and CD8 T-cell function. These data indicate that the immunoregulatory PD-1/PD-L1 pathway is operative during a persistent viral infection in humans, and define a reversible defect in HIV-specific T-cell function. Moreover, this pathway of reversible T-cell impairment provides a potential target for enhancing the function of exhausted T cells in chronic HIV infection.","Univ KwaZulu Natal, Doris Duke Med Res Inst, HIV Pathogenesis Programme, ZA-4013 Durban, South Africa; Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Partner AIDS Res Ctr, Boston, MA 02114 USA; Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Div Aids, Boston, MA 02115 USA; Univ Oxford, Nuffield Dept Med, Oxford OX1 3SY, England; Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Med, Dana Farber Canc Inst, Boston, MA 02115 USA; Emory Univ, Sch Med, Emory Vaccine Ctr, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA; Emory Univ, Sch Med, Dept Microbiol & Immunol, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA; Wistar Inst Anat & Biol, Program Immunol, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; Howard Hughes Med Inst, Chevy Chase, MD 20185 USA","Walker, BD (reprint author), Univ KwaZulu Natal, Doris Duke Med Res Inst, HIV Pathogenesis Programme, ZA-4013 Durban, South Africa.",bwalker@partners.org,"Day, Cheryl/J-9844-2012",,,,,26,1352,1427,9,136,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,21-Sep,2006,443,7109,,,,,350,354,,10.1038/nature05115,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,085RL,WOS:000240622000049,16921384,No,,,11/20/17

Combined with widespread genome sequencing, experimental use of RNAi has the potential to interrogate systematically all genes in a given organism with respect to a particular function(3-9). However, owing to a tolerance for mismatches and gaps in base-pairing with targets(10-12), small RNAs could have up to hundreds of potential target sequences in a genome(13,14), and some small RNAs in mammalian systems have been shown to affect the levels of many messenger RNAs besides their intended targets(15,16). The use of long double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs) in Drosophila, where Dicer-mediated processing produces small RNAs inside cells, has been thought to reduce the probability of such 'off-target effects' (OTEs)(5). Here we show, however, that OTEs mediated by short homology stretches within long dsRNAs are prevalent in Drosophila. We have performed a genome-wide RNAi screen for novel components of Wingless (Wg) signal transduction(17) in Drosophila S2R+ cells, and found few, if any, legitimate candidates. Rather, many of the top candidates exert their effects on Wg response through OTEs on known pathway components or through promiscuous OTEs produced by tandem trinucleotide repeats present in many dsRNAs and genes. Genes containing such repeats are overrepresented in candidate lists from published screens, suggesting that they represent a common class of false positives. Our results suggest simple measures to improve the reliability of genome-wide RNAi screens in Drosophila and other organisms.","Johns Hopkins Univ, Sch Med, Dept Mol Biol & Genet, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA; Johns Hopkins Univ, Sch Med, Dept Oncol, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA","Beachy, PA (reprint author), Stanford Univ, Dept Dev Biol, B300 Beckman Bldg,279 Campus Dr W, W Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",pbeachy@stanford.edu,,,,,,26,190,200,0,11,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,21-Sep,2006,443,7109,,,,,359,363,,10.1038/nature05179,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,085RL,WOS:000240622000051,16964239,No,,,11/20/17

Large samples of galaxies have been found at z approximate to 6 (refs 1 - 4) but detections at earlier times are uncertain and unreliable. It is not at all clear how galaxies built up from the first stars when the Universe was about 300 Myr old ( z approximate to 12 - 15) to z approximate to 6, just 600 Myr later. Here we report the results of a search for galaxies at z approximate to 7 - 8, about 700 Myr after the Big Bang, using the deepest near-infrared and optical images ever taken. Under conservative selection criteria we find only one candidate galaxy at z approximate to 7 - 8, where ten would be expected if there were no evolution in the galaxy population between z approximate to 7 - 8 and z approximate to 6. Using less conservative criteria, there are four candidates, where 17 would be expected with no evolution. This demonstrates that very luminous galaxies are quite rare 700 Myr after the Big Bang.

Here we measure the back-action of a superconducting single-electron transistor (SSET) on a radiofrequency nanomechanical resonator. The conductance of the SSET, which is capacitively coupled to the resonator, provides a sensitive probe of the latter's position; back-action effects manifest themselves as an effective thermal bath, the properties of which depend sensitively on SSET bias conditions. Surprisingly, when the SSET is biased near a transport resonance, we observe cooling of the nanomechanical mode from 550 mK to 300 mK - an effect that is analogous to laser cooling in atomic physics. Our measurements have implications for nanomechanical readout of quantum information devices and the limits of ultrasensitive force microscopy ( such as single-nuclear-spin magnetic resonance force microscopy).

New concepts for devices based on such domain walls are made possible by the direct manipulation of the walls using spin-polarized electrical current(2,3) through the phenomenon of spin momentum transfer(4,5). Most experiments to date have considered the current-driven motion of domain walls under quasi-static conditions(6-12), whereas for technological applications, the walls must be moved on much shorter timescales. Here we show that the motion of domain walls under nanosecond-long current pulses is surprisingly sensitive to the pulse length. In particular, we find that the probability of dislodging a domain wall, confined to a pinning site in a permalloy nanowire, oscillates with the length of the current pulse, with a period of just a few nanoseconds. Using an analytical model(13-17) and micromagnetic simulations, we show that this behaviour is connected to a current-induced oscillatory motion of the domain wall. The period is determined by the wall's mass(18) and the slope of the confining potential. When the current is turned off during phases of the domain wall motion when it has enough momentum, the domain wall is driven out of the confining potential in the opposite direction to the flow of spin angular momentum. This dynamic amplification effect could be exploited in magnetic nanodevices based on domain wall motion.","IBM Corp, Almaden Res Ctr, San Jose, CA 95120 USA; Stanford Univ, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Stanford, CA 94305 USA","Thomas, L (reprint author), IBM Corp, Almaden Res Ctr, 650 Harry Rd, San Jose, CA 95120 USA.",lucthom@us.ibm.com; parkin@almaden.ibm.com,"Parkin, Stuart/D-2521-2012; Hayashi, Masamitsu/H-2809-2011; Moriya, Rai/P-1460-2016","Hayashi, Masamitsu/0000-0003-2134-2563; Moriya, Rai/0000-0001-7471-7432",,,,25,310,312,4,89,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,14-Sep,2006,443,7108,,,,,197,200,,10.1038/nature05093,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,083OB,WOS:000240467000043,16971945,No,,,11/20/17

This makes solid oxygen particularly interesting: it is considered a 'spin-controlled' crystal(1) that displays unusual magnetic order(2). At very high pressures, solid oxygen changes from an insulating to a metallic state(3); at very low temperatures, it even transforms to a superconducting state(4). Structural investigations of solid oxygen began in the 1920s and at present, six distinct crystallographic phases are established unambiguously(1). Of these, the 1 phase of solid oxygen is particularly intriguing: it exhibits a dark-red colour, very strong infrared absorption, and a magnetic collapse(1). It is also stable over a very large pressure domain and has been the subject of numerous X-ray diffraction(5-7), spectroscopic(8-11) and theoretical studies(12-14). But although epsilon-oxygen has been shown to have a monoclinic C2/m symmetry(5-7,15) and its infrared absorption behaviour attributed to the association of oxygen molecules into larger units(9,14), its exact structure remains unknown. Here we use single-crystal X-ray diffraction data collected between 13 and 18 GPa to determine the structure of epsilon-oxygen. We find that epsilon-oxygen is characterized by the association of four O-2 molecules into a rhombohedral molecular unit, held together by what are probably weak chemical bonds.

Climate models consistently predict an increase in the variability of summer temperatures in these areas, but the underlying mechanisms responsible for this increase remain uncertain. Here we explore these mechanisms using regional simulations of recent and future climatic conditions with and without land - atmosphere interactions. Our results indicate that the increase in summer temperature variability predicted in central and eastern Europe is mainly due to feedbacks between the land surface and the atmosphere. Furthermore, they suggest that land - atmosphere interactions increase climate variability in this region because climatic regimes in Europe shift northwards in response to increasing greenhouse gas concentrations, creating a new transitional climate zone with strong land - atmosphere coupling in central and eastern Europe.

In Drosophila class IV dendritic arborization neurons, dendritic tiling, which allows for the complete but nonoverlapping coverage of the dendritic fields(1-3), is established through a 'like-repels-like' behaviour of dendrites mediated by Tricornered (Trc), one of two NDR ( nuclear Dbf2-related) family kinases in Drosophila(4-7). Here we report that the other NDR family kinase, the tumour suppressor Warts/Lats (Wts)(8-10), regulates the maintenance of dendrites; in wts mutants, dendrites initially tile the body wall normally, but progressively lose branches at later larval stages, whereas the axon shows no obvious defects. We further provide biochemical and genetic evidence for the tumour suppressor kinase Hippo (Hpo)(11-15) as an upstream regulator of Wts and Trc for dendrite maintenance and tiling, respectively, thereby revealing important functions of tumour suppressor genes of the Hpo signalling pathway in dendrite morphogenesis.","Univ Calif San Francisco, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Dept Physiol, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; Univ Calif San Francisco, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Dept Biochem, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; Univ Calif San Francisco, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Dept Biophys, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA","Jan, YN (reprint author), Univ Calif San Francisco, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Dept Physiol, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA.",yuhnung.jan@ucsf.edu,,"Jan, Yuh Nung/0000-0003-1367-6299; Jan, Lily/0000-0003-3938-8498","NIMH NIH HHS [F32 MH071101, F32 MH071101-02]",,,29,116,119,1,15,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,14-Sep,2006,443,7108,,,,,210,213,,10.1038/nature05090,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,083OB,WOS:000240467000046,16906135,No,,,11/20/17

In large, long-lived animals with substantial somatic regenerative capacity, such as vertebrates, p53 is an important tumour suppressor - an attribute thought to stem directly from its induction of death or arrest in mutant cells with damaged or unstable genomes. Chemotherapy and radiation exposure both induce widespread p53-dependent DNA damage. This triggers potentially lethal pathologies(2) that are generally deemed an unfortunate but unavoidable consequence of the role p53 has in tumour suppression. Here we show, using a mouse model in which p53 status can be reversibly switched in vivo between functional and inactive states(3), that the p53-mediated pathological response to whole-body irradiation, a prototypical genotoxic carcinogen, is irrelevant for suppression of radiation-induced lymphoma. In contrast, delaying the restoration of p53 function until the acute radiation response has subsided abrogates all of the radiation-induced pathology yet preserves much of the protection from lymphoma. Such protection is absolutely dependent on p19(ARF) - a tumour suppressor induced not by DNA damage, but by oncogenic disruption of the cell cycle.","Univ Calif San Francisco, Canc Res Inst, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; Univ Calif San Francisco, Ctr Comprehens Canc, Dept Mol & Cellular Pharmacol, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA","Evan, GI (reprint author), Univ Calif San Francisco, Canc Res Inst, Box 0128, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA.",gevan@cc.ucsf.edu,,,,,,29,284,289,1,6,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,14-Sep,2006,443,7108,,,,,214,217,,10.1038/nature05077,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,083OB,WOS:000240467000047,16957739,No,,,11/20/17

In higher organisms it is essential for glucose homeostasis(1), whereas the closely related insulin-like growth factor receptor (IGF-1R) is involved in normal growth and development(2). The insulin receptor is expressed in two isoforms, IR-A and IR-B; the former also functions as a high-affinity receptor for IGF-II and is implicated, along with IGF-1R, in malignant transformation(3). Here we present the crystal structure at 3.8 angstrom resolution of the IR-A ectodomain dimer, complexed with four Fabs from the monoclonal antibodies 83-7 and 83-14 ( ref. 4), grown in the presence of a fragment of an insulin mimetic peptide(5). The structure reveals the domain arrangement in the disulphide-linked ectodomain dimer, showing that the insulin receptor adopts a folded-over conformation that places the ligand-binding regions in juxtaposition. This arrangement is very different from previous models(6). It shows that the two L1 domains are on opposite sides of the dimer, too far apart to allow insulin to bind both L1 domains simultaneously as previously proposed(7). Instead, the structure implicates the carboxy-terminal surface of the first fibronectin type III domain as the second binding site involved in high-affinity binding.","CSIRO Mol & Hlth Technol, Parkville, Vic 3052, Australia","Lawrence, MC (reprint author), CSIRO Mol & Hlth Technol, 343 Royal Parade, Parkville, Vic 3052, Australia.",Mike.Lawrence@csiro.au; Colin.Ward@csiro.au,"Lawrence, Michael/A-5357-2009; Adams, Timothy/I-6231-2012; Lovrecz, George/H-8602-2013",,,,,31,159,163,1,44,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,14-Sep,2006,443,7108,,,,,218,221,,10.1038/nature05106,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,083OB,WOS:000240467000048,16957736,No,,,11/20/17

Loss of ATM or failure of its activation in humans and mice lead to defective cellular responses to DSBs, such as cell cycle checkpoints, radiation sensitivity, immune dysfunction, infertility and cancer predisposition. A widely used biological marker to identify the active form of ATM is the autophosphorylation of ATM at a single, conserved serine residue (Ser 1981 in humans; Ser 1987 in mouse)(1). Here we show that Atm-dependent responses are functional at the organismal and cellular level in mice that express a mutant form of Atm ( mutation of Ser to Ala at position 1987) as their sole Atm species. Moreover, the mutant protein does not exhibit dominant-negative interfering activity when expressed physiologically or overexpressed in the context of Atm heterozygous mice.

Stim probably functions as a sensor of luminal Ca2+ content and triggers activation of CRAC channels in the surface membrane after Ca2+ store depletion(1,6). Among three human homologues of Orai ( also known as olf186-F), ORAI1 on chromosome 12 was found to be mutated in patients with severe combined immunodeficiency disease, and expression of wild-type Orai1 restored Ca2+ influx and CRAC channel activity in patient T cells(3). The overexpression of Stim and Orai together markedly increases CRAC current(5,7-9). However, it is not yet clear whether Stim or Orai actually forms the CRAC channel, or whether their expression simply limits CRAC channel activity mediated by a different channel-forming subunit. Here we show that interaction between wild-type Stim and Orai, assessed by coimmunoprecipitation, is greatly enhanced after treatment with thapsigargin to induce Ca2+ store depletion. By site-directed mutagenesis, we show that a point mutation from glutamate to aspartate at position 180 in the conserved S1 - S2 loop of Orai transforms the ion selectivity properties of CRAC current from being Ca2+-selective with inward rectification to being selective for monovalent cations and outwardly rectifying. A charge-neutralizing mutation at the same position ( glutamate to alanine) acts as a dominant-negative non-conducting subunit. Other charge-neutralizing mutants in the same loop express large inwardly rectifying CRAC current, and two of these exhibit reduced sensitivity to the channel blocker Gd3+. These results indicate that Orai itself forms the Ca2+-selectivity filter of the CRAC channel.","Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Physiol & Biophys, Irvine, CA 92697 USA; Univ Calif Irvine, Ctr Immunol, Irvine, CA 92697 USA","Cahalan, MD (reprint author), Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Physiol & Biophys, Irvine, CA 92697 USA.",mcahalan@uci.edu,,,"NINDS NIH HHS [R37 NS014609, R37 NS014609-28]",,,23,524,537,2,24,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,14-Sep,2006,443,7108,,,,,226,229,,10.1038/nature05108,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,083OB,WOS:000240467000050,16921385,No,,,11/20/17

Recent evidence indicates that activation of CRAC current is initiated by STIM proteins, which sense ER Ca2+ levels through an EF-hand located in the ER lumen and relocalize upon store depletion into puncta closely associated with the plasma membrane(3-5). We and others recently identified Drosophila Orai and human Orai1 ( also called TMEM142A) as critical components of store- operated Ca2+ entry downstream of STIM6-8. Combined overexpression of Orai and Stim in Drosophila cells(8), or Orai1 and STIM1 in mammalian cells(9-11), leads to a marked increase in CRAC current. However, these experiments did not establish whether Orai is an essential intracellular link between STIM and the CRAC channel, an accessory protein in the plasma membrane, or an actual pore subunit. Here we show that Orai1 is a plasma membrane protein, and that CRAC channel function is sensitive to mutation of two conserved acidic residues in the transmembrane segments. E106D and E190Q substitutions in transmembrane helices 1 and 3, respectively, diminish Ca2+ influx, increase current carried by monovalent cations, and render the channel permeable to Cs+. These changes in ion selectivity provide strong evidence that Orai1 is a pore subunit of the CRAC channel.","Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Boston, MA 02115 USA; CBR Inst Biomed Res, Boston, MA 02115 USA; Northwestern Univ, Feinberg Sch Med, Dept Mol Pharmacol & Biol Chem, Chicago, IL 60611 USA","Rao, A (reprint author), Harvard Univ, Sch Med, 200 Longwood Ave, Boston, MA 02115 USA.",arao@cbr.med.harvard.edu,,"Feske, Stefan/0000-0001-5431-8178",,,,30,729,743,1,40,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,14-Sep,2006,443,7108,,,,,230,233,,10.1038/nature05122,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,083OB,WOS:000240467000051,16921383,No,,,11/20/17

Intron retention, one form of alternative splicing, is common in plants(2) but rare in higher eukaryotes(3-8), because messenger RNAs with retained introns are subject to cellular restriction at the level of cytoplasmic export and expression(9,10). Often, retention of internal introns restricts the export of these mRNAs and makes them the targets for degradation by the cellular nonsense-mediated decay machinery if they contain premature stop codons(11,12). In fact, many of the database entries for complementary DNAs with retained introns represent them as artefacts that would not affect the proteome(11). Retroviruses are important model systems in studies of regulation of RNAs with retained introns, because their genomic and mRNAs contain one or more unspliced introns(10). For example, Mason - Pfizer monkey virus overcomes cellular restrictions by using a cis-acting RNA element known as the constitutive transport element (CTE)(13). The CTE interacts directly with the Tap protein ( also known as nuclear RNA export factor 1, encoded by NXF1), which is thought to be a principal export receptor for cellular mRNA(14), leading to the hypothesis that cellular mRNAs with retained introns use cellular CTE equivalents to overcome restrictions to their expression(10). Here we show that the Tap gene contains a functional CTE in its alternatively spliced intron 10. Tap mRNA containing this intron is exported to the cytoplasm and is present in polyribosomes. A small Tap protein is encoded by this mRNA and can be detected in human and monkey cells. Our results indicate that Tap regulates expression of its own intron-containing RNA through a CTE-mediated mechanism. Thus, CTEs are likely to be important elements that facilitate efficient expression of mammalian mRNAs with retained introns.","Univ Virginia, Myles H thaler Ctr AIDS & Human Retrovirus Res, Charlottesville, VA 22908 USA; Univ Virginia, Dept Microbiol, Charlottesville, VA 22908 USA","Hammarskjold, ML (reprint author), Univ Virginia, Myles H thaler Ctr AIDS & Human Retrovirus Res, Charlottesville, VA 22908 USA.",mh7g@virginia.edu,,,,,,30,65,67,0,5,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,14-Sep,2006,443,7108,,,,,234,237,,10.1038/nature05107,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,083OB,WOS:000240467000052,16971948,No,,,11/20/17

These accumulations are accompanied by upregulation of cytoplasmic protein chaperones and by induction of the unfolded protein response. We report that the mouse sticky mutation, which causes cerebellar Purkinje cell loss and ataxia, is a missense mutation in the editing domain of the alanyl-tRNA synthetase gene that compromises the proofreading activity of this enzyme during aminoacylation of tRNAs. These findings demonstrate that disruption of translational fidelity in terminally differentiated neurons leads to the accumulation of misfolded proteins and cell death, and provide a novel mechanism underlying neurodegeneration.","Jackson Lab, Bar Harbor, ME 04609 USA; Scripps Res Inst, Skaggs Inst Chem Biol, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; Howard Hughes Med Inst, Bar Harbor, ME 04609 USA","Ackerman, SL (reprint author), Jackson Lab, 600 Main St, Bar Harbor, ME 04609 USA.",susan.ackerman@jax.org,,,NINDS NIH HHS [R01 NS042613],,,35,300,313,2,31,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,7-Sep,2006,443,7107,,,,,50,55,,10.1038/nature05096,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,081JM,WOS:000240313900036,16906134,No,,,11/20/17

One possible explanation is that surfaces of the parent bodies become optically altered, to become the S-type asteroids which are abundant in the main asteroid belt. The process is called 'space weathering' - it makes the visible and near-infrared reflectance spectrum of a body darker and redder(1). A recent survey of small, near-Earth asteroids suggests that the surfaces of small S asteroids may have developing stages of space weathering(2). Here we report that a dark region on a small (550-metre) asteroid-25143 Itokawa-is significantly more space-weathered than a nearby bright region. Spectra of both regions are consistent with those of LL5-6 chondrites after continuum removal(3). A simple calculation(4) suggests that the dark area has a shorter mean optical path length and about 0.04 per cent by volume more nanophase metallic iron particles than the bright area. This clearly shows that space-weathered materials accumulate on small asteroids, which are likely to be the parent bodies of LL chondrites. We conclude that, because LL meteorites are the least abundant of ordinary (H, L, and LL) chondrites, there must be many asteroids with ordinary-chondrite compositions in near-Earth orbits.","Brown Univ, Dept Geol Sci, Providence, RI 02912 USA; Japan Aerosp Explorat Agcy, Inst Space & Astronaut Sci, Kanagawa 2298510, Japan; Univ Tokyo, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, Tokyo 1130033, Japan; Kobe Univ, Grad Sch Sci & Technol, Kobe, Hyogo 6578501, Japan; Ithaca Coll, Ctr Nat Sci 267, Ithaca, NY 14850 USA; Natl Astron Observ Japan, RISE Project Off, Mizusawa, Oshu 0230861, Japan; Seoul Natl Univ, Coll Nat Sci, Sch Earth Environm Sci, Seoul 151742, South Korea; Johns Hopkins Univ, Appl Phys Lab, Laurel, MD 20723 USA","Hiroi, T (reprint author), Brown Univ, Dept Geol Sci, Providence, RI 02912 USA.",takahiro_hiroi@brown.edu,"Barnouin, Olivier/I-7475-2015","Barnouin, Olivier/0000-0002-3578-7750",,,,14,53,53,3,14,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,7-Sep,2006,443,7107,,,,,56,58,,10.1038/nature05073,,3,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,081JM,WOS:000240313900037,16957724,No,,,11/20/17

The transition from laminar to turbulent flow can involve a sequence of instabilities in which the system realizes progressively more complicated states(1), or it can occur suddenly(2,3). Once the transition has taken place, it is generally assumed that, under steady conditions, the turbulent state will persist indefinitely. The flow of a fluid down a straight pipe provides a ubiquitous example of a shear flow undergoing a sudden transition from laminar to turbulent motion(4-6). Extensive calculations(7,8) and experimental studies(9) have shown that, at relatively low flow rates, turbulence in pipes is transient, and is characterized by an exponential distribution of lifetimes. They(8,9) also suggest that for Reynolds numbers exceeding a critical value the lifetime diverges (that is, becomes infinitely large), marking a change from transient to persistent turbulence. Here we present experimental data and numerical calculations covering more than two decades of lifetimes, showing that the lifetime does not in fact diverge but rather increases exponentially with the Reynolds number. This implies that turbulence in pipes is only a transient event (contrary to the commonly accepted view), and that the turbulent and laminar states remain dynamically connected, suggesting avenues for turbulence control(10).","Univ Manchester, Sch Phys & Astron, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England; Delft Univ Technol, Lab Aero & Hydrodynam, NL-2628 CA Delft, Netherlands; Univ Marburg, Fachbereich Phys, D-35032 Marburg, Germany","Hof, B (reprint author), Univ Manchester, Sch Phys & Astron, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England.",bjorn@reynolds.ph.man.ac.uk; j.westerweel@tudelft.nl,"Westerweel , Jerry/G-9087-2011; Eckhardt, Bruno/D-5948-2012; Schneider, Tobias/C-5797-2015","Eckhardt, Bruno/0000-0003-4050-3254; Schneider, Tobias/0000-0002-8617-8998",,,,25,153,153,1,42,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,7-Sep,2006,443,7107,,,,,59,62,,10.1038/nature05089,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,081JM,WOS:000240313900038,16957725,No,,,11/20/17

Of several different types of fuel cells under development today, polymer electrolyte fuel cells (PEFCs) have been recognized as a potential future power source for zero-emission vehicles(4,5). However, to become commercially viable, PEFCs have to overcome the barrier of high catalyst cost caused by the exclusive use of platinum and platinum-based catalysts(6-8) in the fuel-cell electrodes. Here we demonstrate a new class of low-cost (non-precious metal)/(heteroatomic polymer) nanocomposite catalysts for the PEFC cathode, capable of combining high oxygen-reduction activity with good performance durability. Without any optimization, the cobalt-polypyrrole composite catalyst enables power densities of about 0.15 W cm(-2) in H-2-O-2 fuel cells and displays no signs of performance degradation for more than 100 hours.

The catalyst is a small, simple molecule that can be prepared in three steps from commercial materials without the need for rigorously controlled conditions. Enantioselective silylations are performed with commercial silyl chlorides and produce yields of up to 96 per cent at an enantiomeric ratio of up to 98:2.

Thaw lakes in North Siberia are known to emit methane(3), but the magnitude of these emissions remains uncertain because most methane is released through ebullition (bubbling), which is spatially and temporally variable. Here we report a new method of measuring ebullition and use it to quantify methane emissions from two thaw lakes in North Siberia. We show that ebullition accounts for 95 per cent of methane emissions from these lakes, and that methane flux from thaw lakes in our study region may be five times higher than previously estimated(3). Extrapolation of these fluxes indicates that thaw lakes in North Siberia emit 3.8 teragrams of methane per year, which increases present estimates of methane emissions from northern wetlands (<6-40 teragrams per year; refs 1, 2, 4-6) by between 10 and 63 per cent. We find that thawing permafrost along lake margins accounts for most of the methane released from the lakes, and estimate that an expansion of thaw lakes between 1974 and 2000, which was concurrent with regional warming, increased methane emissions in our study region by 58 per cent. Furthermore, the Pleistocene age (35,260-42,900 years) of methane emitted from hotspots along thawing lake margins indicates that this positive feedback to climate warming has led to the release of old carbon stocks previously stored in permafrost.","Univ Alaska, Inst Arctic Biol, Fairbanks, AK 99775 USA; NE Sci Stn, Cherskii 678830, Russia; Florida State Univ, Dept Oceanog, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA; Univ Alaska, Dept Forest Sci, Fairbanks, AK 99775 USA","Walter, KM (reprint author), Univ Alaska, Inst Arctic Biol, Fairbanks, AK 99775 USA.",ftkmw1@uaf.edu,,"Chapin III, F Stuart/0000-0002-2558-9910",,,,31,477,496,17,275,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,7-Sep,2006,443,7107,,,,,71,75,,10.1038/nature05040,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,081JM,WOS:000240313900041,16957728,No,,,11/20/17

Eruption dynamics involve a complex interplay between nucleation and growth of vapour bubbles and crystallization, generating highly nonlinear variation in the physical properties of magma as it ascends beneath a volcano(2). This makes explosive volcanism difficult to model and, ultimately, to predict. A key unknown is the temperature variation in magma rising through the sub-volcanic system, as it loses gas and crystallizes en route(3). Thermodynamic modelling of magma that degasses, but does not crystallize, indicates that both cooling and heating are possible(4). Hitherto it has not been possible to evaluate such alternatives because of the difficulty of tracking temperature variations in moving magma several kilometres below the surface. Here we extend recent work on glassy melt inclusions trapped in plagioclase crystals(5) to develop a method for tracking pressure-temperature-crystallinity paths in magma beneath two active andesite volcanoes. We use dissolved H2O in melt inclusions to constrain the pressure of H2O at the time an inclusion became sealed, incompatible trace element concentrations to calculate the corresponding magma crystallinity and plagioclase-melt geothermometry to determine the temperature. These data are allied to ilmenite-magnetite geothermometry to show that the temperature of ascending magma increases by up to 100 degrees C, owing to the release of latent heat of crystallization. This heating can account for several common textural features of andesitic magmas, which might otherwise be erroneously attributed to pre-eruptive magma mixing.","Univ Bristol, Dept Earth Sci, Bristol BS8 1RJ, Avon, England; Univ Oregon, Dept Geol Sci, Eugene, OR 97403 USA","Blundy, J (reprint author), Univ Bristol, Dept Earth Sci, Wills Mem Bldg, Bristol BS8 1RJ, Avon, England.",Jon.Blundy@bris.ac.uk,"Humphreys, Madeleine/C-3999-2015","Humphreys, Madeleine/0000-0001-9343-1237",,,,32,153,157,2,48,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,7-Sep,2006,443,7107,,,,,76,80,,10.1038/nature05100,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,081JM,WOS:000240313900042,16957729,No,,,11/20/17

Visual deprivation during the critical period has catastrophic effects on visual function, including loss of visual responsiveness to the deprived eye(1-3), reduced visual acuity(4), and loss of tuning to many stimulus characteristics(2,5). These changes occur faster than the remodelling of thalamocortical axons(6), but the intracortical plasticity mechanisms that underlie them are incompletely understood. Longterm depression of excitatory intracortical synapses has been proposed as a general candidate mechanism for the loss of cortical responsiveness after visual deprivation(7,8). Alternatively (or in addition), the decreased ability of the deprived eye to activate cortical neurons could be due to enhanced intracortical inhibition(9,10). Here we show that visual deprivation leaves excitatory connections in layer 4 (the primary input layer to cortex) unaffected, but markedly potentiates inhibitory feedback between fast-spiking basket cells (FS cells) and star pyramidal neurons (star pyramids). Further, a previously undescribed form of long-term potentiation of inhibition (LTPi) could be induced at synapses from FS cells to star pyramids, and was occluded by previous visual deprivation. These data suggest that potentiation of inhibition is a major cellular mechanism underlying the deprivation-induced degradation of visual function, and that this form of LTPi is important in fine-tuning cortical circuitry in response to visual experience.","Brandeis Univ, Dept Biol, Waltham, MA 02454 USA; Brandeis Univ, Ctr Behav Genom, Waltham, MA 02454 USA","Turrigiano, GG (reprint author), Brandeis Univ, Dept Biol, Waltham, MA 02454 USA.",turrigiano@brandeis.edu,,"Nelson, Sacha/0000-0002-0108-8599",,,,30,216,219,0,13,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,7-Sep,2006,443,7107,,,,,81,84,,10.1038/nature05079,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,081JM,WOS:000240313900043,16929304,No,,,11/20/17

Through experience, we learn to group stimuli into categories, such as 'chair', 'table' and 'vehicle', which are critical for rapidly and appropriately selecting behavioural responses(1,2). Although much is known about the neural representation of simple visual stimulus features (for example, orientation, direction and colour), relatively little is known about how the brain learns and encodes the meaning of stimuli. We trained monkeys to classify 360 degrees of visual motion directions into two discrete categories, and compared neuronal activity in the lateral intraparietal (LIP) and middle temporal (MT) areas, two interconnected brain regions(3) known to be involved in visual motion processing(4-6). Here we show that neurons in LIP-an area known to be centrally involved in visuo-spatial attention(7-9), motor planning(10-13) and decision-making(14-16)-robustly reflect the category of motion direction as a result of learning. The activity of LIP neurons encoded directions of motion according to their category membership, and that encoding shifted after the monkeys were retrained to group the same stimuli into two new categories. In contrast, neurons in area MT were strongly direction selective but carried little, if any, explicit category information. This indicates that LIP might be an important nexus for the transformation of visual direction selectivity to more abstract representations that encode the behavioural relevance, or meaning, of stimuli.","Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Neurobiol, Boston, MA 02115 USA","Freedman, DJ (reprint author), Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Neurobiol, 220 Longwood Ave, Boston, MA 02115 USA.",davidfreedman@alum.mit.edu,,,,,,28,248,251,1,25,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,7-Sep,2006,443,7107,,,,,85,88,,10.1038/nature05078,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,081JM,WOS:000240313900044,16936716,No,,,11/20/17

Recombination is advantageous when different individuals in a population carry different advantageous alleles(1,2). By bringing together advantageous alleles onto the same chromosome, recombination speeds up the process of adaptation(1,3-5) and opposes the fixation of harmful mutations by means of Muller's ratchet(4,5). Nevertheless, adaptive substitutions favour sex and recombination only if the rate of adaptive mutation is high(1,6), and Muller's ratchet operates only in small or asexual populations(7). Here, by tracking the fate of modifier alleles that alter the frequency of sex and recombination, we show that background selection against deleterious mutant alleles provides a stochastic advantage to sex and recombination that increases with population size. The advantage arises because, with low levels of recombination, selection at other loci severely reduces the effective population size and genetic variance in fitness at a focal locus(8) (the Hill-Robertson effect), making a population less able to respond to selection and to rid itself of deleterious mutations. Sex and recombination reveal the hidden genetic variance in fitness by combining chromosomes of intermediate fitness to create chromosomes that are relatively free of (or are loaded with) deleterious mutations. This increase in genetic variance within finite populations improves the response to selection and generates a substantial advantage to sex and recombination that is fairly insensitive to the form of epistatic interactions between deleterious alleles. The mechanism supported by our results offers a robust and broadly applicable explanation for the evolutionary advantage of recombination and can explain the spread of costly sex.","Univ Edinburgh, Inst Evolutionary Biol, Edinburgh EH9 3JT, Midlothian, Scotland; Univ British Columbia, Dept Zool, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada","Keightley, PD (reprint author), Univ Edinburgh, Inst Evolutionary Biol, W Mains Rd, Edinburgh EH9 3JT, Midlothian, Scotland.",keightley.nature2006@spambob.net,"Otto, Sarah/K-5625-2012","Otto, Sarah/0000-0003-3042-0818",,,,30,198,201,3,60,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,7-Sep,2006,443,7107,,,,,89,92,,10.1038/nature05049,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,081JM,WOS:000240313900045,16957730,No,,,11/20/17

Many species survive and possibly reproduce in anoxic habitats(1), but sustainable anaerobic metabolism has not been previously described.

The amounts of nitrate detected are estimated to be sufficient to support respiration for over a month. In a Swedish fjord sediment where G. pseudospinescens is the dominant foraminifer, the intracellular nitrate pool in this species accounted for 20% of the large, cell-bound, nitrate pool present in an oxygen-free zone. Similarly high nitrate concentrations were also detected in foraminifera Nonionella cf. stella and a Stainforthia species, the two dominant benthic taxa occurring within the oxygen minimum zone of the continental shelf off Chile. Given the high abundance of foraminifera in anoxic marine environments(1-3), these new findings suggest that foraminifera may play an important role in global nitrogen cycling and indicate that our understanding of the complexity of the marine nitrogen cycle is far from complete.","Natl Environm Res Inst, Dept Marine Ecol, DK-8600 Silkeborg, Denmark; Univ Utrecht, Fac Geosci, Dept Earth Sci, NL-3584 CD Utrecht, Netherlands; Aarhus Univ, Dept Biol Sci, DK-8000 Aarhus, Denmark; Radboud Univ Nijmegen, IWWR, Dept Plant Cell Biol, NL-6525 ED Nijmegen, Netherlands; CSIC, Ctr Environm Sci, Dept Aquat Ecol, E-28006 Madrid, Spain; Univ Gothenburg, Kristineberg Marine Res Stn, Dept Marine Ecol, S-45034 Fiskebackskil, Sweden; Radboud Univ Nijmegen, IWWR, Dept Microbiol, NL-6525 ED Nijmegen, Netherlands","Risgaard-Petersen, N (reprint author), Natl Environm Res Inst, Dept Marine Ecol, Vejlsovej 25, DK-8600 Silkeborg, Denmark.",nri@dmu.dk,"Jetten, Mike/B-8834-2011; Schmid, Markus/D-2669-2012; Revsbech, Niels/I-8040-2013; Risgaard-Petersen, Nils/J-2479-2013; Cedhagen, Tomas/J-6426-2013; Nielsen, Lars Peter/J-7401-2013; Op den Camp, Huub/F-5114-2011","Jetten, Mike/0000-0002-4691-7039; Cedhagen, Tomas/0000-0003-4550-8177; Nielsen, Lars Peter/0000-0002-7269-4860; Op den Camp, Huub/0000-0003-1990-9030; Revsbech, Niels Peter/0000-0002-2193-262X",,,,26,209,224,5,103,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,7-Sep,2006,443,7107,,,,,93,96,,10.1038/nature05070,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,081JM,WOS:000240313900046,16957731,No,,,11/20/17

However, little is known about how these organs sense that equilibrium is breached, and how they cease changing when homeostasis is reached. Similarly, it remains unclear how, during normal development, different cell types within an organ coordinate their growth. Here we show that during gonad development in the fruitfly Drosophila melanogaster the proliferation of primordial germ cells (PGCs) and survival of the somatic intermingled cells (ICs) that contact them are coordinated by means of a feedback mechanism composed of a positive signal and a negative signal. PGCs express the EGF receptor (EGFR) ligand Spitz, which is required for IC survival. In turn, ICs inhibit PGC proliferation. Thus, homeostasis and coordination of growth between soma and germ line in the larval ovary is achieved by using a sensor of PGC numbers (EGFR-mediated survival of ICs) coupled to a correction mechanism inhibiting PGC proliferation. This feedback loop ensures that sufficient numbers of PGCs exist to fill all the stem-cell niches that form at the end of larval development. We propose that similar feedback mechanisms might be generally used for coordinated growth, regeneration and homeostasis.","NYU, Sch Med, Howard Hughes Med Inst, New York, NY 10016 USA; NYU, Sch Med, Skirball Inst, Dev Genet Program, New York, NY 10016 USA; NYU, Sch Med, Dept Cell Biol, New York, NY 10016 USA","Lehmann, R (reprint author), NYU, Sch Med, Howard Hughes Med Inst, 540 1st Ave, New York, NY 10016 USA.",lehmann@saturn.med.nyu.edu,,"Lehmann, Ruth/0000-0002-8454-5651",,,,24,65,68,1,13,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,7-Sep,2006,443,7107,,,,,97,100,,10.1038/nature05068,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,081JM,WOS:000240313900047,16936717,No,,,11/20/17

The integrity of sperm chromatin is a clinical indicator of male fertility and in vitro fertilization potential(1): chromosome aneuploidy and DNA decondensation or damage are correlated with reproductive failure. Identifying conserved proteins important for sperm chromatin structure and packaging can reveal universal causes of infertility. Here we combine proteomics, cytology and functional analysis in Caenorhabditis elegans to identify spermatogenic chromatin-associated proteins that are important for fertility. Our strategy employed multiple steps: purification of chromatin from comparable meiotic cell types, namely those undergoing spermatogenesis or oogenesis; proteomic analysis by multidimensional protein identification technology (MudPIT) of factors that co-purify with chromatin; prioritization of sperm proteins based on abundance; and subtraction of common proteins to eliminate general chromatin and meiotic factors. Our approach reduced 1,099 proteins co-purified with spermatogenic chromatin, currently the most extensive catalogue, to 132 proteins for functional analysis. Reduction of gene function through RNA interference coupled with protein localization studies revealed conserved spermatogenesis-specific proteins vital for DNA compaction, chromosome segregation, and fertility. Unexpected roles in spermatogenesis were also detected for factors involved in other processes. Our strategy to find fertility factors conserved from C. elegans to mammals achieved its goal: of mouse gene knockouts corresponding to nematode proteins, 37% (7/19) cause male sterility. Our list therefore provides significant opportunity to identify causes of male infertility and targets for male contraceptives.","San Francisco State Univ, Dept Biol, San Francisco, CA 94132 USA; Scripps Res Inst, Dept Cell Biol, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; Agilent Technol, Wilmington, DE 19808 USA; Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mol & Cell Biol, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; Univ Calif Berkeley, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA","Chu, DS (reprint author), San Francisco State Univ, Dept Biol, 1600 Holloway Ave, San Francisco, CA 94132 USA.",chud@sfsu.edu,,,"Howard Hughes Medical Institute; NIGMS NIH HHS [R01 GM030702, R01 GM030702-28]",,,30,113,152,2,18,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,7-Sep,2006,443,7107,,,,,101,105,,10.1038/nature05050,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,081JM,WOS:000240313900048,16943775,No,,,11/20/17

Polar auxin transport(1,2) is maintained by a network of auxin influx (AUX)(3) and efflux (PIN)(1,2,4-6) carriers. Both auxin transport and PIN protein cycling between the plasma membrane and endosomes require the activity of the endosomal GNOM(1,2,7,8); however, intracellular routes taken by these carriers remain largely unknown. Here we show that Arabidopsis thaliana SORTING NEXIN 1 (AtSNX1) is involved in the auxin pathway and that PIN2, but not PIN1 or AUX1, is transported through AtSNX1-containing endosomes. We demonstrate that the snx1-null mutant exhibits multiple auxin-related defects and that loss of function of AtSNX1 severely enhances the phenotype of a weak gnom mutant. In root cells, we further show that AtSNX1 localizes to an endosomal compartment distinct from GNOM-containing endosomes, and that PIN2 accumulates in this compartment after treatment with the phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase inhibitor wortmannin or after a gravity stimulus. Our data reveal the existence of a novel endosomal compartment involved in PIN2 endocytic sorting and plant development.","Univ Lyon 1, Ecole Normale Super Lyon, Inst Natl Rech Agron, CNRS,IFR Biosci Lyon Gerland 128, F-69364 Lyon 07, France","Gaude, T (reprint author), Univ Lyon 1, Ecole Normale Super Lyon, Inst Natl Rech Agron, CNRS,IFR Biosci Lyon Gerland 128, 46 Allee Italie, F-69364 Lyon 07, France.",thierry.gaude@ens-lyon.fr,,"Jaillais, Yvon/0000-0003-4923-883X",,,,27,212,222,1,28,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,7-Sep,2006,443,7107,,,,,106,109,,10.1038/nature05046,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,081JM,WOS:000240313900049,16936718,No,,,11/20/17

The maturation, turnover and quality control of RNA is performed by many different classes of ribonucleases(1). Ribonuclease II (RNase II) is a major exoribonuclease that intervenes in all of these fundamental processes(1); it can act independently or as a component of the exosome, an essential RNA-degrading multiprotein complex(2). RNase II-like enzymes are found in all three kingdoms of life, but there are no structural data for any of the proteins of this family(1-5). Here we report the X-ray crystallographic structures of both the ligand-free (at 2.44 angstrom resolution) and RNA-bound (at 2.74 angstrom resolution) forms of Escherichia coli RNase II. In contrast to sequence predictions, the structures show that RNase II is organized into four domains: two cold-shock domains, one RNB catalytic domain, which has an unprecedented alpha beta-fold, and one S1 domain. The enzyme establishes contacts with RNA in two distinct regions, the 'anchor' and the 'catalytic' regions, which act synergistically to provide catalysis(6). The active site is buried within the RNB catalytic domain, in a pocket formed by four conserved sequence motifs. The structure shows that the catalytic pocket is only accessible to single-stranded RNA, and explains the specificity for RNA versus DNA cleavage. It also explains the dynamic mechanism of RNA degradation by providing the structural basis for RNA translocation and enzyme processivity. We propose a reaction mechanism for exonucleolytic RNA degradation involving key conserved residues. Our three-dimensional model corroborates all existing biochemical data for RNase II, and elucidates the general basis for RNA degradation. Moreover, it reveals important structural features that can be extrapolated to other members of this family.","Univ Nova Lisboa, Inst Tecnol Quim & Biol, Div Biol Chem, P-2781901 Oeiras, Portugal; Univ Nova Lisboa, Inst Tecnol Quim & Biol, Div Biol, P-2781901 Oeiras, Portugal; Global Phasing Ltd, Cambridge CB3 0AX, England","Carrondo, MA (reprint author), Univ Nova Lisboa, Inst Tecnol Quim & Biol, Div Biol Chem, Apt 127, P-2781901 Oeiras, Portugal.",cecilia@itqb.unl.pt; carrondo@itqb.unl.pt,"McVey, Colin/C-2110-2008; Amblar, 2405/C-3941-2011; Amblar, Monica/E-2366-2016","McVey, Colin/0000-0001-7457-2130; Amblar, Monica/0000-0003-3530-615X; Arraiano, Cecilia/0000-0003-1934-9301; Frazao, Carlos/0000-0002-7725-1671; Barbas, Ana/0000-0002-6245-8549; Carrondo, Maria Armenia/0000-0002-1261-1162",,,,30,141,144,1,7,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,7-Sep,2006,443,7107,,,,,110,114,,10.1038/nature05080,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,081JM,WOS:000240313900050,16957732,No,,,11/20/17

Here we confirm that tolerant allografts, which are sustained owing to the immunosuppressive effects of T-Reg cells, acquire a unique genetic signature dominated by the expression of mast-cell-gene products. We also show that mast cells are crucial for allograft tolerance, through the inability to induce tolerance in mast-cell-deficient mice. High levels of interleukin (IL)-9 - a mast cell growth and activation factor - are produced by activated T-Reg cells, and IL-9 production seems important in mast cell recruitment to, and activation in, tolerant tissue. Our data indicate that IL-9 represents the functional link through which activated T-Reg cells recruit and activate mast cells to mediate regional immune suppression, because neutralization of IL-9 greatly accelerates allograft rejection in tolerant mice. Finally, immunohistochemical analysis clearly demonstrates the existence of this novel T-Reg - IL-9-mast cell relationship within tolerant allografts.","Dartmouth Med Sch, Dept Microbiol & Immunol, Lebanon, NH 03756 USA; Norris Cotton Canc Ctr, Lebanon, NH 03756 USA; Medimmune Inc, Dept Autoimmun & Inflammat, Gaithersburg, MD 20878 USA; Ludwig Inst Canc Res Brussels Branch, B-1200 Brussels, Belgium; Univ Louvain, Expt Med Unit, Brussels Branch, B-1200 Brussels, Belgium; Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Beth Israel Deaconess Med Ctr, Dept Med, Boston, MA 02215 USA","Noelle, RJ (reprint author), Dartmouth Med Sch, Dept Microbiol & Immunol, 1 Med Ctr Dr, Lebanon, NH 03756 USA.",rjn@dartmouth.edu,"Pino-Lagos, Karina/C-9583-2017","Pino-Lagos, Karina/0000-0002-4070-6169; Lu, Li-Fan/0000-0002-9727-0036",,,,30,487,514,1,8,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,31-Aug,2006,442,7106,,,,,997,1002,,10.1038/nature05010,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,078YF,WOS:000240142000039,16921386,No,,,11/20/17

An understanding of the signals required to direct integral membrane proteins to the inner nuclear membrane (INM) remains a notable exception. Here we show that integral INM proteins possess basic sequence motifs that resemble 'classical' nuclear localization signals. These sequences can mediate direct binding to karyopherin-alpha and are essential for the passage of integral membrane proteins to the INM. Furthermore, karyopherin-alpha, karyopherin-beta 1 and the Ran GTPase cycle are required for INM targeting, underscoring parallels between mechanisms governing the targeting of integral INM proteins and soluble nuclear transport. We also provide evidence that specific nuclear pore complex proteins contribute to this process, suggesting a role for signal-mediated alterations in the nuclear pore complex to allow for passage of INM proteins along the pore membrane.","Rockefeller Univ, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Cell Biol Lab, New York, NY 10021 USA","King, MC (reprint author), Rockefeller Univ, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Cell Biol Lab, 1230 York Ave, New York, NY 10021 USA.",mking@rockefeller.edu; plusk@rockefeller.edu,,,,,,32,164,169,1,10,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,31-Aug,2006,442,7106,,,,,1003,1007,,10.1038/nature05075,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,078YF,WOS:000240142000040,16929305,No,,,11/20/17

In particular, we do not know how the jet that defines a gamma-ray burst emerges from the star's surface, nor how a GRB progenitor explodes. Here we report observations of the relatively nearby GRB 060218 (ref. 5) and its connection to supernova SN 2006aj ( ref. 6). In addition to the classical non-thermal emission, GRB 060218 shows a thermal component in its X-ray spectrum, which cools and shifts into the optical/ ultraviolet band as time passes. We interpret these features as arising from the break-out of a shock wave driven by a mildly relativistic shell into the dense wind surrounding the progenitor(7). We have caught a supernova in the act of exploding, directly observing the shock break-out, which indicates that the GRB progenitor was a Wolf Rayet star.","Osserv Astron Brera, INAF, I-23807 Merate, LC, Italy; Ist Astrofis Spaziale & Fis Cosm Palermo, INAF, I-90146 Palermo, Italy; UCL, Mullard Space Sci Lab, Dorking RH5 6NT, Surrey, England; Penn State Univ, Dept Astron & Astrophys, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; Univ Milano Bicocca, I-20126 Milan, Italy; NASA, Goddard Space Flight Ctr, Greenbelt, MD 20771 USA; CNR, Washington, DC 20418 USA; Osserv Astrofis Arcetri, INAF, I-50125 Florence, Italy; Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Kavli Inst Theoret Phys, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; SISSA, ISAS, I-34014 Trieste, Italy; Penn State Univ, Dept Phys, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; Weizmann Inst Sci, Fac Phys, IL-76100 Rehovot, Israel; Univ Nevada, Dept Phys, Las Vegas, NV 89154 USA; Nanjing Univ, Dept Astron, Nanjing 210093, Peoples R China; PPARC, Swindon SN2 1SZ, Wilts, England; Univ Leicester, Dept Phys & Astron, Leicester LE1 7RH, Leics, England; Sonoma State Univ, Dept Phys & Astron, Rohnert Pk, CA 94928 USA; ASI Sci Data Ctr, I-00044 Frascati, Roma, Italy; Univ Space Res Assoc, Columbia, MD 21044 USA; Los Alamos Natl Lab, Los Alamos, NM 87545 USA","Campana, S (reprint author), Osserv Astron Brera, INAF, Via E Bianchi 46, I-23807 Merate, LC, Italy.",sergio.campana@brera.inaf.it,"White, Nicholas/B-6428-2012; Barthelmy, Scott/D-2943-2012; Boyd, Patricia/D-3274-2012; Gehrels, Neil/D-2971-2012; WAXMAN, ELI/K-1557-2012","White, Nicholas/0000-0003-3853-3462; moretti, alberto/0000-0002-9770-0315; Della Valle, Massimo/0000-0003-3142-5020; Romano, Patrizia/0000-0003-0258-7469; giommi, paolo/0000-0002-2265-5003; Cusumano, Giancarlo/0000-0002-8151-1990; Tagliaferri, Gianpiero/0000-0003-0121-0723",,,,28,488,494,1,27,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,31-Aug,2006,442,7106,,,,,1008,1010,,10.1038/nature04892,,3,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,078YF,WOS:000240142000041,16943830,No,,,11/20/17

Less-luminous supernovae were not hitherto known to be associated with GRBs, and therefore GRB - supernovae were thought to be rare events(6). Whether X-ray flashes - analogues of GRBs, but with lower luminosities and fewer gamma-rays - can also be associated with supernovae, and whether they are intrinsically 'weak' events or typical GRBs viewed off the axis of the burst(7), is unclear. Here we report the optical discovery and follow-up observations of the type Ic supernova SN 2006aj associated with X-ray flash XRF 060218. Supernova 2006aj is intrinsically less luminous than the GRB - supernovae, but more luminous than many supernovae not accompanied by a GRB. The ejecta velocities derived from our spectra are intermediate between these two groups, which is consistent with the weakness of both the GRB output(8) and the supernova radio flux(9). Our data, combined with radio and X-ray observations(8-10), suggest that XRF 060218 is an intrinsically weak and soft event, rather than a classical GRB observed off-axis. This extends the GRB - supernova connection to X-ray flashes and fainter supernovae, implying a common origin. Events such as XRF 060218 are probably more numerous than GRB - supernovae.","Trieste Astron Observ, Ist Nazl Astrofis, I-34131 Trieste, Italy; Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Kavli Inst Theoret Phys, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; Max Planck Inst Astrophys, D-85748 Garching, Germany; Univ Tokyo, Sch Sci, Dept Astron, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo 1130033, Japan; Univ Tokyo, Sch Sci, Res Ctr Early Universe, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo 1130033, Japan; IASF, Ist Nazl Astrofis, I-40129 Bologna, Italy; Thuringer Landessternwarte Tautenburg, D-07778 Tautenburg, Germany; Inst Adv Study, Princeton, NJ 08540 USA; Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Astron & Astrophys, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA; NASA, MSFC, NSSTC, Huntsville, AL 35805 USA; Chinese Acad Sci, Natl Astron Observ, Beijing 100012, Peoples R China; Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Astron, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; Univ Copenhagen, Niels Bohr Inst, Dark Cosmol Ctr, DK-2100 Copenhagen O, Denmark; European So Observ, D-85748 Garching, Germany; Stockholm Univ, Dept Astron, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden; Univ Chile, Dept Astron, Santiago, Chile; European So Observ, Santiago 19, Chile; Univ Hertfordshire, Ctr Astrophys Res, Hatfield AL10 9AB, Herts, England; Univ Leicester, Dept Phys & Astron, Xray & Observat Astron Grp, Leicester LE1 7RH, Leics, England; Univ Amsterdam, Astron Inst Anton Pannekoek, NL-1098 SJ Amsterdam, Netherlands; Univ Calif Berkeley, Lawrence Berkeley Lab, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; Chinese Acad Sci, Purple Mt Observ, Nanjing 210008, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; Padova Astron Observ, Ist Nazl Astrofis, I-35122 Padua, Italy; CSIC, IAA, E-18080 Granada, Spain; Univ Victoria, Dept Phys & Astron, Victoria, BC V8P 1A1, Canada; Univ Ferrara, Dept Phys, I-44100 Ferrara, Italy; Space Telescope Sci Inst, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA; Max Planck Inst Extraterr Phys, D-85741 Garching, Germany; Hiroshima Univ, Hiroshima Astrophys Sci Ctr, Hiroshima 7398526, Japan; Univ Tokyo, Coll Arts & Sci, Dept Earth Sci & Astron, Meguro Ku, Tokyo 1538902, Japan","Pian, E (reprint author), Trieste Astron Observ, Ist Nazl Astrofis, Via GB Tiepolo 11, I-34131 Trieste, Italy.",pian@oats.inaf.it,"; Fynbo, Johan/L-8496-2014; Hjorth, Jens/M-5787-2014; Sauer, Daniel/A-3033-2012; Palazzi, Eliana/N-4746-2015; Kawabata, Koji/G-1957-2017","Amati, Lorenzo/0000-0001-5355-7388; Wijers, Ralph/0000-0002-3101-1808; Castro-Tirado, A.

Although all these events result from the death of massive stars, the electromagnetic luminosities of GRBs and XRFs exceed those of ordinary type Ibc supernovae by many orders of magnitude. The essential physical process that causes a dying star to produce a GRB or XRF, and not just a supernova, is still unknown. Here we report radio and X-ray observations of XRF 060218 ( associated(4) with supernova SN 2006aj), the second-nearest(5,6) GRB identified until now. We show that this event is a hundred times less energetic but ten times more common than cosmological GRBs. Moreover, it is distinguished from ordinary type Ibc supernovae by the presence of 10(48) erg coupled to mildly relativistic ejecta, along with a central engine ( an accretion-fed, rapidly rotating compact source) that produces X-rays for weeks after the explosion. This suggests that the production of relativistic ejecta is the key physical distinction between GRBs or XRFs and ordinary supernovae, while the nature of the central engine ( black hole or magnetar) may distinguish typical bursts from low-luminosity, spherical events like XRF 060218.","CALTECH, Caltech Opt Observ 105 24, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA; CALTECH, Space Radiat Lab 220 47, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA; Carnegie Observ, Pasadena, CA 91101 USA; Penn State Univ, Dept Astron, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; Natl Radio Astron Observ, Socorro, NM 87801 USA; Univ Virginia, Dept Astron, Charlottesville, VA 22903 USA; Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Racah Inst Phys, IL-91904 Jerusalem, Israel; Univ Hawaii, Inst Astron, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; ANU, Mt Stromlo Observ, RSAA, Weston, ACT 2611, Australia; Univ Cambridge, Cavendish Lab, Mullard Radio Astron Observ, Cambridge CB3 0HE, England; Pomona Coll, Dept Phys & Astron, Claremont, CA 91711 USA; NASA, Goddard Space Flight Ctr, Greenbelt, MD 20771 USA","Soderberg, AM (reprint author), CALTECH, Caltech Opt Observ 105 24, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA.",ams@astro.caltech.edu,"Gehrels, Neil/D-2971-2012","Schmidt, Brian/0000-0001-6589-1287; Schmidt, Brian/0000-0002-8538-9195",,,,30,313,317,2,16,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,31-Aug,2006,442,7106,,,,,1014,1017,,10.1038/nature05087,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,078YF,WOS:000240142000043,16943832,No,,,11/20/17

A very massive progenitor, collapsing to a black hole, was thought to be a requirement for the launch of a GRB(8). Here we report the results of modelling the spectra and light curve of SN 2006aj ( ref. 9), which demonstrate that the supernova had a much smaller explosion energy and ejected much less mass than the other GRB - supernovae, suggesting that it was produced by a star whose initial mass was only similar to 20 M-.. A star of this mass is expected to form a neutron star rather than a black hole when its core collapses. The smaller explosion energy of SN 2006aj is matched by the weakness and softness(10) of GRB 060218 ( an X-ray flash), and the weakness of the radio flux of the supernova(11). Our results indicate that the supernova - GRB connection extends to a much broader range of stellar masses than previously thought, possibly involving different physical mechanisms: a 'collapsar' ( ref. 8) for the more massive stars collapsing to a black hole, and magnetic activity of the nascent neutron star(12) for the less massive stars.","Max Planck Inst Astrophys, D-85748 Garching, Germany; CAS, Natl Astron Observ, Beijing 100012, Peoples R China; Univ Tokyo, Sch Sci, Res Ctr Early Universe, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo 1130033, Japan; Univ Tokyo, Sch Sci, Dept Astron, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo 1130033, Japan; Osserv Astron Trieste, Ist Nazl Astrofis, I-34131 Trieste, Italy; Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Kavli Inst Theoret Phys, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; Univ Tokyo, Coll Arts & Sci, Dept Earth Sci & Astron, Meguro Ku, Tokyo 1538902, Japan; Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Astron, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA","Mazzali, PA (reprint author), Max Planck Inst Astrophys, Karl Schwarzschild Str 1, D-85748 Garching, Germany.",mazzali@mpa-garching.mpg.de; jsdeng@bao.ac.cn,"Sauer, Daniel/A-3033-2012","Sauer, Daniel/0000-0002-0317-5063; Mazzali, Paolo/0000-0001-6876-8284",,,,30,231,233,0,6,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,31-Aug,2006,442,7106,,,,,1018,1020,,10.1038/nature05081,,3,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,078YF,WOS:000240142000044,16943833,No,,,11/20/17

But the recorded bulk magnetic field itself provides only limited spatial or structural information about the sample. Most NMR applications rely therefore on more elaborate techniques such as magnetic field gradient encoding(1) or spin correlation spectroscopy(2), which enable spatially resolved imaging and molecular structure analysis, respectively. Here we demonstrate a fundamentally different and intrinsically information-richer modality of detecting NMR, based on the rotation of the polarization of a laser beam by the nuclear spins in a liquid sample. Optical NMR detection has in fact a long history in atomic vapours with narrow resonance lines(3,4), but has so far only been applied to highly specialized condensed matter systems such as quantum dots(5). It has been predicted(6) that laser illumination can shift NMR frequencies and thus aid detection, but the effect is very small and has never been observed. In contrast, our measurements on water and liquid Xe-129 show that the complementary effect the rotation of light polarization by nuclear spins - is readily measurable, and that it is enhanced dramatically in samples containing heavy nuclei. This approach to optical NMR detection should allow correlated optical and NMR spectroscopy on complex molecules, and continuous two-dimensional imaging of nuclear magnetization with spatial resolution limited only by light diffraction.","Princeton Univ, Dept Phys, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA","Romalis, MV (reprint author), Princeton Univ, Dept Phys, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA.",romalis@princeton.edu,"Lee, Seung-Kyun/A-3464-2008","Lee, Seung-Kyun/0000-0001-7625-3141",,,,30,57,57,1,28,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,31-Aug,2006,442,7106,,,,,1021,1024,,10.1038/nature05088,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,078YF,WOS:000240142000045,16943834,No,,,11/20/17

Yet even the largest of these manipulative experiments represents only a small fraction of an ocean basin, and the responses observed are strongly influenced by the proliferation of rare species rather than the growth of naturally dominant populations(4,5). Here we link unique fluorescence attributes of phytoplankton to specific physiological responses to nutrient stress, and use these relationships to evaluate the factors that constrain phytoplankton growth in the tropical Pacific Ocean on an unprecedented spatial scale. On the basis of fluorescence measurements taken over 12 years, we delineate three major ecophysiological regimes in this region. We find that iron has a key function in regulating phytoplankton growth in both HNLC and oligotrophic waters near the Equator and further south, whereas nitrogen and zooplankton grazing are the primary factors that regulate biomass production in the north. Application of our findings to the interpretation of satellite chlorophyll fields shows that productivity in the tropical Pacific basin may be 1.2 - 2.5 Pg C yr(-1) lower than previous estimates have suggested, a difference that is comparable to the global change in ocean production that accompanied the largest El Nino to La Nina transition on record(6).","Oregon State Univ, Dept Bot & Plant Pathol, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA; NASA, Sci Applicat Int Corp, Goddard Space Flight Ctr, Greenbelt, MD 20771 USA; Rutgers State Univ, Inst Marine & Coastal Sci, New Brunswick, NJ 08901 USA; Rutgers State Univ, Dept Geol Sci, New Brunswick, NJ 08901 USA; Monterey Bay Aquarium Res Inst, Moss Landing, CA 95039 USA; Oregon State Univ, Coll Ocean & Atmospher Sci, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA; NOAA, Pacific Marine Environm Lab, Seattle, WA 98115 USA","Behrenfeld, MJ (reprint author), Oregon State Univ, Dept Bot & Plant Pathol, Cordley Hall 2082, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA.",mjb@science.oregonstate.edu,"Strutton, Peter/C-4466-2011; McPhaden, Michael/D-9799-2016","Strutton, Peter/0000-0002-2395-9471; ",,,,29,136,148,3,64,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,31-Aug,2006,442,7106,,,,,1025,1028,,10.1038/nature05083,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,078YF,WOS:000240142000046,16943835,No,,,11/20/17

The reflections of seismic waves from crustal magma chambers have been observed beneath intermediate(2,3) and fast-spreading centres(4,5), but it has been difficult to image such magma chambers beneath slow-spreading centres(6,7), owing to rough seafloor topography and associated seafloor scattering(7,8). In the absence of any images of magma chambers(6) or of subsurface near-axis faults, it has been difficult to characterize the interplay of magmatic and tectonic processes in crustal accretion and hydrothermal circulation at slow-spreading ridges. Here we report the presence of a crustal magma chamber beneath the slow-spreading Lucky Strike segment of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. The reflection from the top of the magma chamber, centred beneath the Lucky Strike volcano and hydrothermal field, is approximately 3 km beneath the sea floor, 3 - 4 km wide and extends up to 7 km along-axis. We suggest that this magma chamber provides the heat for the active hydrothermal vent field above it. We also observe axial valley bounding faults that seem to penetrate down to the magma chamber depth as well as a set of inward-dipping faults cutting through the volcanic edifice, suggesting continuous interactions between tectonic and magmatic processes.","Inst Phys Globe, Lab Geosci Marines, F-75252 Paris, France; Woods Hole Oceanog Inst, Dept Geol & Geophys, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA; Univ Lisbon, Ctr Geofis, P-1749016 Lisbon, Portugal","Singh, SC (reprint author), Inst Phys Globe, Lab Geosci Marines, 4 Pl Jussieu, F-75252 Paris, France.",singh@ipgp.jussieu.fr,"; Escartin, Javier/B-3344-2008; Miranda, Jorge/B-5287-2008; pgp, lgm/F-8796-2010; ESCARTIN, Javier/A-1043-2010; Cannat, Mathilde/F-9304-2010; Crawford, Wayne/A-5658-2011; ipgp, Laboratoire geoscien/F-8471-2010; Carton, Helene/N-9417-2017","Canales, Juan Pablo/0000-0003-3066-7888; Miranda, Jorge/0000-0002-1321-8709; ESCARTIN, Javier/0000-0002-3416-6856; ",,,,30,139,141,3,49,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,31-Aug,2006,442,7106,,,,,1029,1032,,10.1038/nature05105,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,078YF,WOS:000240142000047,16943836,No,,,11/20/17

The earliest vertebrate fossils lack paired fins but have well-developed median fins(1,2), suggesting that the mechanisms of fin development were assembled first in the midline. Here we show that shark median fin development involves the same genetic programs that operate in paired appendages. Using molecular markers for different cell types, we show that median fins arise predominantly from somitic ( paraxial) mesoderm, whereas paired appendages develop from lateral plate mesoderm. Expression of Hoxd and Tbx18 genes, which specify paired limb positions(3,4), also delineates the positions of median fins. Proximodistal development of median fins occurs beneath an apical ectodermal ridge, the structure that controls outgrowth of paired appendages(5-7). Each median fin bud then acquires an anteroposteriorly-nested pattern of Hoxd expression similar to that which establishes skeletal polarity in limbs(8,9). Thus, despite their different embryonic origins, paired and median fins utilize a common suite of developmental mechanisms. We extended our analysis to lampreys, which diverged from the lineage leading to gnathostomes before the origin of paired appendages(2,10), and show that their median fins also develop from somites and express orthologous Hox and Tbx genes. Together these results suggest that the molecular mechanisms for fin development originated in somitic mesoderm of early vertebrates, and that the origin of paired appendages was associated with re-deployment of these mechanisms to lateral plate mesoderm.","Univ Florida, Dept Zool, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; Univ Florida, Dept Anat & Cell Biol, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA","Cohn, MJ (reprint author), Univ Florida, Dept Zool, POB 118525, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA.",cohn@zoo.ufl.edu,"Zhang, GuangJun/K-2056-2012; freitas, renata/I-5917-2013","freitas, renata/0000-0002-0123-7232; Zhang, GuangJun/0000-0002-0839-5161",,,,30,106,112,1,28,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,31-Aug,2006,442,7106,,,,,1033,1037,,10.1038/nature04984,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,078YF,WOS:000240142000048,16878142,No,,,11/20/17

Here we use a discrete Markov model validated by time-lapse microscopy and clonal analysis to demonstrate that the distribution of polygonal cell types in epithelia is not a result of cell packing, but rather a direct mathematical consequence of cell proliferation. On the basis of in vivo analysis of mitotic cell junction dynamics in Drosophila imaginal discs, we mathematically predict the convergence of epithelial topology to a fixed equilibrium distribution of cellular polygons. This distribution is empirically confirmed in tissue samples from vertebrate, arthropod and cnidarian organisms, suggesting that a similar proliferation-dependent cell pattern underlies pattern formation and morphogenesis throughout the metazoa.","Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Genet, Boston, MA 02115 USA; Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Boston, MA 02115 USA; Harvard Univ, Div Engn & Appl Sci, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA","Gibson, MC (reprint author), Stowers Inst Med Res, 1000 E 50th St, Kansas City, MO 64110 USA.",mgx@stowers-institute.org; rad@eecs.harvard.edu,,"Perrimon, Norbert/0000-0001-7542-472X",,,,26,182,184,3,22,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,31-Aug,2006,442,7106,,,,,1038,1041,,10.1038/nature05014,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,078YF,WOS:000240142000049,16900102,No,,,11/20/17

These theories highlight a central role for reward prediction errors in updating the values associated with available actions(2). In animals, substantial evidence indicates that the neurotransmitter dopamine might have a key function in this type of learning, through its ability to modulate cortico-striatal synaptic efficacy(3). However, no direct evidence links dopamine, striatal activity and behavioural choice in humans. Here we show that, during instrumental learning, the magnitude of reward prediction error expressed in the striatum is modulated by the administration of drugs enhancing (3,4-dihydroxy-L-phenylalanine; L-DOPA) or reducing ( haloperidol) dopaminergic function. Accordingly, subjects treated with L-DOPA have a greater propensity to choose the most rewarding action relative to subjects treated with haloperidol. Furthermore, incorporating the magnitude of the prediction errors into a standard action-value learning algorithm accurately reproduced subjects' behavioural choices under the different drug conditions. We conclude that dopamine-dependent modulation of striatal activity can account for how the human brain uses reward prediction errors to improve future decisions.","Wellcome Dept Imaging Neurosci, London WC1N 3BG, England","Pessiglione, M (reprint author), Wellcome Dept Imaging Neurosci, 12 Queen Sq, London WC1N 3BG, England.",m.pessiglione@fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk,"Frith, Chris/A-2171-2009; Pessiglione, Mathias/E-2141-2017","Frith, Chris/0000-0002-8665-0690; Dolan, Ray/0000-0001-9356-761X; Seymour, Ben/0000-0003-1724-5832","Wellcome Trust [, 078865]",,,30,647,653,3,93,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,31-Aug,2006,442,7106,,,,,1042,1045,,10.1038/nature05051,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,078YF,WOS:000240142000050,16929307,No,,,11/20/17

The result is plant tolerance to conditions such as excessive or inadequate light, water, salt and temperature, and resistance to pathogens. Not only is plant physiology known to change under abiotic or biotic stress, but changes in the genome have also been identified(1-5). However, it was not determined whether plants from successive generations of the original, stressed plants inherited the capacity for genomic change. Here we show that in Arabidopsis thaliana plants treated with short-wavelength radiation (ultraviolet-C) or flagellin ( an elicitor of plant defences(6)), somatic homologous recombination of a transgenic reporter is increased in the treated population and these increased levels of homologous recombination persist in the subsequent, untreated generations. The epigenetic trait of enhanced homologous recombination could be transmitted through both the maternal and the paternal crossing partner, and proved to be dominant. The increase of the hyper-recombination state in generations subsequent to the treated generation was independent of the presence of the transgenic allele ( the recombination substrate under consideration) in the treated plant. We conclude that environmental factors lead to increased genomic flexibility even in successive, untreated generations, and may increase the potential for adaptation.","Friedrich Miescher Inst Biomed Res, CH-4058 Basel, Switzerland","Hohn, B (reprint author), Friedrich Miescher Inst Biomed Res, Maulbeerstr 66, CH-4058 Basel, Switzerland.",barbara.hohn@fmi.ch,"ZIPFEL, CYRIL/D-7103-2011","ZIPFEL, CYRIL/0000-0003-4935-8583",,,,26,322,344,14,162,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,31-Aug,2006,442,7106,,,,,1046,1049,,10.1038/nature05022,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,078YF,WOS:000240142000051,16892047,No,,,11/20/17

Live-cell imaging techniques have enabled the visualization of a variety of intranuclear activities, from chromosome dynamics(3) to gene expression(4). However, progress in studying transcription regulation of specific native genes has been limited, primarily as a result of difficulties in resolving individual gene loci and in detecting the small number of protein molecules functioning within active transcription units. Here we report that multiphoton microscopy imaging(5) of polytene nuclei in living Drosophila salivary glands allows real-time analysis of transcription factor recruitment and exchange on specific native genes. After heat shock, we have visualized the recruitment of RNA polymerase II (Pol II) to native hsp70 gene loci 87A and 87C in real time. We show that heat shock factor (HSF), the transcription activator of hsp70, is localized to the nucleus before heat shock and translocates from nucleoplasm to chromosomal loci after heat shock. Assays based on fluorescence recovery after photobleaching(6) show a rapid exchange of HSF at chromosomal loci under non-heat-shock conditions but a very slow exchange after heat shock. However, this is not a consequence of a change of HSF diffusibility, as shown here directly by fluorescence correlation spectroscopy(7). Our results provide strong evidence that activated HSF is stably bound to DNA in vivo and that turnover or disassembly of transcription activator is not required for rounds of hsp70 transcription. This and previous studies(8,9) indicate that transcription activators display diverse dynamic behaviours in their associations with targeted loci in living cells. Our method can be applied to study the dynamics of many factors involved in transcription and RNA processing, and in their regulation at native heat shock genes in vivo.","Cornell Univ, Field Biochem Mol & Cell Biol, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; Cornell Univ, Sch Appl & Engn Phys, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; Cornell Univ, Dept Mol Biol & Genet, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA","Lis, JT (reprint author), Cornell Univ, Field Biochem Mol & Cell Biol, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",www2@cornell.edu; jtl10@cornell.edu,"Webb, Watt/B-5905-2011; Munson, Katherine/P-2462-2015; Yao, Jie/E-2229-2017","Munson, Katherine/0000-0001-8413-6498; Yao, Jie/0000-0002-7640-4840",,,,30,138,139,1,13,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,31-Aug,2006,442,7106,,,,,1050,1053,,10.1038/nature05025,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,078YF,WOS:000240142000052,16929308,No,,,11/20/17

Recent studies of these complexes have shown that some are quite dynamic in living cells(1) owing to rapid and reversible disruption of activator promoter complexes by molecular chaperones(2-6), or a slower, ubiquitin - proteasome-pathway-mediated turnover of DNA-bound activator(7-9). These mechanisms may act to ensure continued responsiveness of activators to signalling cascades by limiting the lifetime of the active protein - DNA complex. Furthermore, the potency of some activators is compromised by proteasome inhibition, leading to the suggestion that periodic clearance of activators from a promoter is essential for high-level expression(8,10-12). Here we describe a variant of the chromatin immunoprecipitation assay that has allowed direct observation of the kinetic stability of native Gal4-promoter complexes in yeast. Under non-inducing conditions, the complex is dynamic, but on induction the Gal4 - promoter complexes 'lock in' and exhibit long half-lives. Inhibition of proteasome-mediated proteolysis had little or no effect on Gal4-mediated gene expression. These studies, combined with earlier data, show that the lifetimes of different transactivator - promoter complexes in vivo can vary widely and that proteasome-mediated turnover is not a general requirement for transactivator function.","Univ Texas, SW Med Ctr, Dept Internal Med, Dallas, TX 75390 USA; Univ Texas, SW Med Ctr, Dept Mol Biol, Dallas, TX 75390 USA","Kodadek, T (reprint author), Univ Texas, SW Med Ctr, Dept Internal Med, 5323 Harry Hines Blvd, Dallas, TX 75390 USA.",Thomas.Kodadek@utsouthwestern.edu,,,,,,24,61,62,0,4,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,31-Aug,2006,442,7106,,,,,1054,1057,,10.1038/nature05067,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,078YF,WOS:000240142000053,16929306,No,,,11/20/17

It modulates diverse cellular processes in the cytoplasm and nucleus(1-5), including the expression of amino acid transporters, ribosomal RNAs and ribosomal proteins. Despite considerable recent progress, little is known about the spatial and temporal regulation of TOR signalling, particularly that leading into the nucleus. Here we show that Tor1 is dynamically distributed in the cytoplasm and nucleus in yeast. Tor1 nuclear localization is nutrient dependent and rapamycin sensitive: starvation or treatment with rapamycin causes Tor1 to exit from the nucleus. Tor1 nuclear localization is critical for 35S rRNA synthesis, but not for the expression of amino acid transporters and ribosomal protein genes. We show further that Tor1 is associated with 35S ribosomal DNA ( rDNA) promoter chromatin in a rapamycin- and starvation-sensitive manner; this association is necessary for 35S rRNA synthesis and cell growth. These results indicate that the spatial regulation of TOR complex 1 (TORC1) might be involved in differential control of its target genes. TOR is known as a classic cytoplasmic kinase that mediates the cytoplasm-to-nucleus signalling by controlling the localization of transcription factors. Our data indicate that TOR might be more intimately involved in gene regulation than previously thought.","Univ Med & Dent New Jersey, Robert Wood Johnson Med Sch, Dept Pharmacol, Piscataway, NJ 08854 USA; Washington Univ, Sch Med, Dept Med, St Louis, MO 63110 USA","Zheng, XFS (reprint author), Univ Med & Dent New Jersey, Robert Wood Johnson Med Sch, Dept Pharmacol, 675 Hoes Lane, Piscataway, NJ 08854 USA.",zhengst@umdnj.edu,,"Watkins, Marcus/0000-0002-1224-3478",,,,30,134,135,1,6,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,31-Aug,2006,442,7106,,,,,1058,1061,,10.1038/nature05020,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,078YF,WOS:000240142000054,16900101,No,,,11/20/17

The flagellar motor consists of a fixed, membrane-embedded, torque-generating stator and a typically bidirectional, spinning rotor that changes direction in response to chemotactic signals. Most structural analyses so far have targeted the purified rotor(3,4), and hence little is known about the stator and its interactions. Here we show, using electron cryotomography of whole cells, the in situ structure of the complete flagellar motor from the spirochaete Treponema primitia at 7 nm resolution. Twenty individual motor particles were computationally extracted from the reconstructions, aligned and then averaged. The stator assembly, revealed for the first time, possessed 16-fold symmetry and was connected directly to the rotor, C ring and a novel P-ring-like structure. The unusually large size of the motor suggested mechanisms for increasing torque and supported models wherein critical interactions occur atop the C ring, where our data suggest that both the carboxy-terminal and middle domains of FliG are found.","CALTECH, Div Biol, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA; CALTECH, Div Environm Sci & Engn, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA","Jensen, GJ (reprint author), CALTECH, Div Biol, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA.",jensen@caltech.edu,,,,,,21,115,115,0,9,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,31-Aug,2006,442,7106,,,,,1062,1064,,10.1038/nature05015,,3,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,078YF,WOS:000240142000055,16885937,No,,,11/20/17

Previously, it has been assumed that RecA binds to the DNA template strand being copied. Here we show, however, that pol-V-catalysed translesion synthesis, in the presence or absence of the beta-processivity-clamp, occurs only when RecA nucleoprotein filaments assemble or RecA protomers bind on separate single-stranded ( ss) DNA molecules in trans. A 3'-proximal RecA filament end on trans DNA is essential for stimulation; however, synthesis is strengthened by further pol V - RecA interactions occurring elsewhere along a trans nucleoprotein filament. We suggest that trans-stimulation of pol V by RecA bound to ssDNA reflects a distinctive regulatory mechanism of mutation that resolves the paradox of RecA filaments assembled in cis on a damaged template strand obstructing translesion DNA synthesis despite the absolute requirement of RecA for SOS mutagenesis.","Univ So Calif, Dept Biol Sci & Chem, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA; Univ Wisconsin, Dept Biochem, Madison, WI 53706 USA; NICHHD, Sect DNA Replicat Repair & Mutagenesis, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA","Goodman, MF (reprint author), Univ So Calif, Dept Biol Sci & Chem, Univ Pk, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA.",mgoodman@usc.edu,,,Intramural NIH HHS,,,31,62,62,3,11,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,24-Aug,2006,442,7105,,,,,883,887,,10.1038/nature05042,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,076LT,WOS:000239960500029,16929290,No,,,11/20/17

These black holes may interact with their host galaxies by means of 'feedback' in the form of energy and material jets; this feedback affects the evolution of the host and gives rise to observed relations between the black hole and the host(5). Here we report observations of the ultraviolet emissions of massive early-type galaxies. We derive an empirical relation for a critical black-hole mass ( as a function of velocity dispersion) above which the outflows from these black holes suppress star formation in their hosts by heating and expelling all available cold gas.

The X-ray pulsar XTE J1810-197 was revealed ( in 2003) as the first AXP with transient emission when its luminosity increased 100-fold from the quiescent level(2); a coincident radio source of unknown origin was detected one year later(3).

There is no evidence of radio emission before the 2003 X-ray outburst ( unlike ordinary pulsars, which emit radio pulses all the time), and the flux varies from day to day. The flux at all radio frequencies is approximately equal - and at > 20 GHz XTE J1810-197 is currently the brightest neutron star known.

These nuclei owe their enhanced stability to closed shells in the structure of both protons and neutrons(1-3). However, theoretical approaches to date do not yield consistent predictions of the precise limits of the 'island of stability'; experimental studies are therefore crucial. The bulk of experimental effort so far has been focused on the direct creation of superheavy elements in heavy ion fusion reactions, leading to the production of elements up to proton number Z = 118 ( refs 4, 5). Recently, it has become possible to make detailed spectroscopic studies(6,7) of nuclei beyond fermium (Z = 100), with the aim of understanding the underlying single-particle structure of superheavy elements. Here we report such a study of the nobelium isotope 254 No, with 102 protons and 152 neutrons - the heaviest nucleus studied in this manner to date. We find three excited structures, two of which are isomeric (metastable). One of these structures is firmly assigned to a two-proton excitation. These states are highly significant as their location is sensitive to single-particle levels above the gap in shell energies predicted at Z = 114, and thus provide a microscopic benchmark for nuclear models of the superheavy elements.","Univ Liverpool, Dept Phys, Liverpool L69 7ZE, Merseyside, England; Univ Jyvaskyla, Dept Phys, FI-40014 Jyvaskyla, Finland; Comenius Univ, Dept Nucl Phys & Biophys, Bratislava 84248, Slovakia; Univ Helsinki, Dept Phys Sci, FI-00014 Helsinki, Finland; Gesell Schwerionenforsch GSI, D-64291 Darmstadt, Germany; CEA Saclay, DAPNIA SPhN, F-91191 Gif Sur Yvette, France; Univ Notre Dame, Dept Phys, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA; Univ Notre Dame, Joint Inst Nucl Astrophys, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA","Herzberg, RD (reprint author), Univ Liverpool, Dept Phys, Liverpool L69 7ZE, Merseyside, England.",rdh@ns.ph.liv.ac.uk,"Pakarinen, Janne/F-6695-2010; Herzberg, Rolf-Dietmar/E-1558-2011; KORTEN, Wolfram/H-3043-2013; Scholey, Catherine/G-2720-2014; THEISEN, Christophe/A-9343-2015; Sun, Yang/P-2417-2015","Pakarinen, Janne/0000-0001-8944-8757; KORTEN, Wolfram/0000-0002-3940-0816; Scholey, Catherine/0000-0002-8743-6071; THEISEN, Christophe/0000-0002-8509-1022; Butler, Peter/0000-0001-6080-9205",,,,30,137,143,1,11,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,24-Aug,2006,442,7105,,,,,896,899,,10.1038/nature05069,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,076LT,WOS:000239960500032,16929293,No,,,11/20/17

The conductance through a QPC changes as a function of its width in integer steps of G(0) = 2e(2)/h ( where e is the charge on an electron, and h is Planck's constant), signalling the quantization of its transverse modes(1,2). But measurements of these conductance steps also reveal an additional shoulder at a value around 0.7 G(0) (refs 1 - 4), an observation that has remained a puzzle for more than a decade. It has recently been suggested(5,6) that this phenomenon can be explained by the existence of a magnetic 'impurity' in the QPC at low electron densities. Here we present extensive numerical density-functional calculations that reveal the formation of an electronic state with a spin-1/2 magnetic moment in the channel under very general conditions. In addition, we show that such an impurity will also form at large magnetic fields, for a specific value of the field, and sometimes even at the opening of the second transverse mode in the QPC. Beyond explaining the source of the '0.7 anomaly', these results may have far-reaching implications for spin-filling of electronic states in quantum dots and for the dephasing of quantum information stored in semiconductor qubits.","Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Dept Phys, IL-84105 Beer Sheva, Israel; Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Ilse Katz Ctr Meso & Nano Scale Sci & Technol, IL-84105 Beer Sheva, Israel","Rejec, T (reprint author), Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Dept Phys, IL-84105 Beer Sheva, Israel.",tomaz.rejec@ijs.si,,,,,,20,121,121,0,15,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,24-Aug,2006,442,7105,,,,,900,903,,10.1038/nature05054,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,076LT,WOS:000239960500033,16929294,No,,,11/20/17

Although scanning tunnelling microscopy observations under high vacuum conditions can allow stable measurements of electron transport, most measurements of a single molecule bonded in a metal - molecule - metal junction exhibit relatively large variations in conductance. As a result, even simple predictions about how molecules behave in such junctions have still not been rigorously tested. For instance, it is well known(13,14) that the tunnelling current passing through a molecule depends on its conformation; but although some experiments have verified this effect(15-18), a comprehensive mapping of how junction conductance changes with molecular conformation is not yet available. In the simple case of a biphenyl - a molecule with two phenyl rings linked by a single C - C bond - conductance is expected to change with the relative twist angle between the two rings, with the planar conformation having the highest conductance. Here we use amine link groups to form single-molecule junctions with more reproducible current - voltage characteristics(19). This allows us to extract average conductance values from thousands of individual measurements on a series of seven biphenyl molecules with different ring substitutions that alter the twist angle of the molecules. We find that the conductance for the series decreases with increasing twist angle, consistent with a cosine-squared relation predicted for transport through pi-conjugated biphenyl systems(13).","Columbia Univ, Dept Phys, New York, NY 10027 USA; Columbia Univ, Dept Chem, New York, NY 10027 USA; Columbia Univ, Dept Appl Phys & Appl Math, New York, NY 10027 USA; Columbia Univ, Ctr Electron Transport Mol Nanostruct, New York, NY 10027 USA","Venkataraman, L (reprint author), Columbia Univ, Dept Phys, 538 W 120th St, New York, NY 10027 USA.",latha@phys.columbia.edu; msh2102@columbia.edu,,"Venkataraman, Latha/0000-0002-6957-6089; Hybertsen, Mark S/0000-0003-3596-9754",,,,28,789,793,18,240,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,24-Aug,2006,442,7105,,,,,904,907,,10.1038/nature05037,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,076LT,WOS:000239960500034,16929295,No,,,11/20/17

This is because the only mechanism known to produce MIF-S has been ultraviolet photolysis of volcanic sulphur dioxide gas in an oxygen-poor atmosphere.

However, as altruistic norm compliance and norm enforcement often emerge in the context of inter-group conflicts(13,14), they are likely to be shaped by parochialism(15) - a preference for favouring the members of one's ethnic, racial or language group. We have conducted punishment experiments(16), which allow 'impartial' observers to punish norm violators, with indigenous groups in Papua New Guinea. Here we show that these experiments confirm the prediction of parochialism. We found that punishers protect ingroup victims - who suffer from a norm violation - much more than they do outgroup victims, regardless of the norm violator's group affiliation. Norm violators also expect that punishers will be lenient if the latter belong to their social group. As a consequence, norm violations occur more often if the punisher and the norm violator belong to the same group. Our results are puzzling for evolutionary multi-level selection theories based on selective group extinction(2-5) as well as for theories of individual selection(17-19); they also indicate the need to explicitly examine the interactions between individuals stemming from different groups in evolutionary models.","Univ Zurich, Inst Empir Res Econ, CH-8006 Zurich, Switzerland; Coll Helveticum, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland","Fehr, E (reprint author), Univ Zurich, Inst Empir Res Econ, Blumlisalpstr 10, CH-8006 Zurich, Switzerland.",fiba@iew.unizh.ch; efehr@iew.unizh.ch,"Fischbacher, Urs/H-2693-2014","Fischbacher, Urs/0000-0002-5115-8815",,,,33,230,234,3,91,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,24-Aug,2006,442,7105,,,,,912,915,,10.1038/nature04981,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,076LT,WOS:000239960500036,16929297,No,,,11/20/17

A large proportion of FTD patients ( 35 - 50%) have a family history of dementia, consistent with a strong genetic component to the disease(2). In 1998, mutations in the gene encoding the microtubule-associated protein tau ( MAPT) were shown to cause familial FTD with parkinsonism linked to chromosome 17q21 (FTDP- 17)(3). The neuropathology of patients with defined MAPT mutations is characterized by cytoplasmic neurofibrillary inclusions composed of hyperphosphorylated tau(3,4). However, in multiple FTD families with significant evidence for linkage to the same region on chromosome 17q21 (D17S1787 - D17S806), mutations in MAPT have not been found and the patients consistently lack tauimmunoreactive inclusion pathology(5-12). In contrast, these patients have ubiquitin (ub)-immunoreactive neuronal cytoplasmic inclusions and characteristic lentiform ub-immunoreactive neuronal intranuclear inclusions(11-13). Here we demonstrate that in these families, FTD is caused by mutations in progranulin (PGRN) that are likely to create null alleles. PGRN is located 1.7 Mb centromeric of MAPT on chromosome 17q21.31 and encodes a 68.5-kDa secreted growth factor involved in the regulation of multiple processes including development, wound repair and inflammation(14). PGRN has also been strongly linked to tumorigenesis(14). Moreover, PGRN expression is increased in activated microglia in many neurodegenerative diseases including Creutzfeldt - Jakob disease, motor neuron disease and Alzheimer's disease(15,16). Our results identify mutations in PGRN as a cause of neurodegenerative disease and indicate the importance of PGRN function for neuronal survival.","Mayo Clin Coll Med, Dept Neurosci, Jacksonville, FL 32224 USA; Univ British Columbia, Dept Med Genet, Vancouver, BC V6T 2B5, Canada; Univ British Columbia, Dept Pathol, Vancouver, BC V6T 2B5, Canada; Univ British Columbia, Div Neurol, Vancouver, BC V6T 2B5, Canada; Univ Manchester, Dept Med, Div Lab & Regenerat Med, Manchester M13 9PT, Lancs, England; Hope Hosp, Greater Manchester Neurosci Ctr, Ctr Clin Neurosci, Salford M6 8HD, Lancs, England; Mayo Clin Coll Med, Dept Neurol, Rochester, MN 55905 USA","Hutton, M (reprint author), Mayo Clin Coll Med, Dept Neurosci, 4500 San Pablo Rd, Jacksonville, FL 32224 USA.",ian.mackenzie@vch.ca; hutton.michael@mayo.edu,"Pickering-Brown, Stuart/D-4008-2009; Dickey, Chad/H-4441-2011; Eriksen, Jason/A-8054-2008","Pickering-Brown, Stuart/0000-0003-1561-6054; Eriksen, Jason/0000-0003-1549-4165; Dickson, Dennis W/0000-0001-7189-7917; Feldman, Howard/0000-0002-9258-4538; Snowden, Julie/0000-0002-3976-4310",Medical Research Council [G0400356],,,31,1018,1038,7,58,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,24-Aug,2006,442,7105,,,,,916,919,,10.1038/nature05016,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,076LT,WOS:000239960500037,16862116,No,,,11/20/17

FTDU-17 patients have consistently been shown to lack a tau-immunoreactive pathology(1-3), a feature characteristic of FTD with parkinsonism linked to mutations in MAPT (FTDP-17)(4). Furthermore, in FTDU-17 patients, mutations in MAPT and genomic rearrangements in the MAPT region have been excluded by both genomic sequencing(5) and fluorescence in situ hybridization on mechanically stretched chromosomes(6). Here we demonstrate that FTDU-17 is caused by mutations in the gene coding for progranulin (PGRN), a growth factor involved in multiple physiological and pathological processes including tumorigenesis(7). Besides the production of truncated PGRN proteins due to premature stop codons(8), we identified a mutation within the splice donor site of intron 0 (IVS0+5G> C), indicating loss of the mutant transcript by nuclear degradation. The finding was made within an extensively documented Belgian FTDU-17 founder family(3). Transcript and protein analyses confirmed the absence of the mutant allele and a reduction in the expression of PGRN. We also identified a mutation ( c. 3G>A) in the Met1 translation initiation codon, indicating loss of PGRN due to lack of translation of the mutant allele. Our data provide evidence that PGRN haploinsufficiency leads to neurodegeneration because of reduced PGRN-mediated neuronal survival. Furthermore, in a Belgian series of familial FTD patients, PGRN mutations were 3.5 times more frequent than mutations in MAPT, underscoring a principal involvement of PGRN in FTD pathogenesis.","Univ Antwerp VIB, Dept Mol Genet, Neurodegenerat Brain Dis Grp, BE-2610 Antwerp, Belgium; Inst Born Bunge, Neurogenet Lab, BE-2610 Antwerp, Belgium; Inst Born Bunge, Lab Neurochem & Behav, BE-2610 Antwerp, Belgium; Inst Born Bunge, Neuropathol Lab, BE-2610 Antwerp, Belgium; Univ Antwerp, BE-2610 Antwerp, Belgium; Middleheim Gen Hosp, Dept Neurol, Memory Clin, BE-2610 Antwerp, Belgium; Katholieke Univ Leuven, Univ Hosp Gasthuisberg, Dept Pathol, BE-3000 Louvain, Belgium; Katholieke Univ Leuven, Univ Hosp Gasthuisberg, Dept Neurol, BE-3000 Louvain, Belgium; Univ Ghent, State Univ Ghent Hosp, Dept Neurol, BE-9000 Ghent, Belgium; Erasmus MC, Dept Epidemiol & Biostat, Genet Epidemiol Grp, NL-3000 DR Rotterdam, Netherlands","Van Broeckhoven, C (reprint author), Univ Antwerp VIB, Dept Mol Genet, Neurodegenerat Brain Dis Grp, Univ Pl 1, BE-2610 Antwerp, Belgium.",christine.vanbroeckhoven@ua.ac.be,"Kumar-Singh, Samir/G-6280-2012; Cruts, Marc/J-6161-2013; santens, patrick/O-2505-2013; Vandenberghe, Rik/K-2145-2014","Kumar-Singh, Samir/0000-0001-9466-6732; Cruts, Marc/0000-0002-1338-992X; Vandenberghe, Rik/0000-0001-6237-2502; Pirici, Daniel/0000-0002-0196-0949; Pirici, Daniel/0000-0001-9192-7319; Santens, Patrick/0000-0002-8886-9776",,,,28,806,817,2,51,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,24-Aug,2006,442,7105,,,,,920,924,,10.1038/nature05017,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,076LT,WOS:000239960500038,16862115,No,,,11/20/17

This map contains 'orientation pinwheels', structures that are arranged like the spokes of a wheel such that orientation changes continuously around a centre. Conventional optical imaging(3,4) first demonstrated these pinwheels(3,5), but the technique lacked the spatial resolution to determine the response properties and arrangement of cells near pinwheel centres. Electrophysiological recordings later demonstrated sharply selective neurons near pinwheel centres(6,7), but it remained unclear whether they were arranged randomly or in an orderly fashion. Here we use two-photon calcium imaging in vivo(8-12) to determine the microstructure of pinwheel centres in cat visual cortex with single-cell resolution. We find that pinwheel centres are highly ordered: neurons selective to different orientations are clearly segregated even in the very centre. Thus, pinwheel centres truly represent singularities in the cortical map.

Accumulating evidence indicates that these new neurons are involved in learning and memory(5-8). A substantial fraction of newly born neurons die before they mature(9,10) and the survival of new neurons is regulated in an experience-dependent manner(5,6,11), raising the possibility that the selective survival or death of new neurons has a direct role in a process of learning and memory such as information storage - through the information-specific construction of new circuits. However, a critical assumption of this hypothesis is that the survival or death decision of new neurons is information-specific. Because neurons receive their information primarily through their input synaptic activity, we investigated whether the survival of new neurons is regulated by input activity in a cell-specific manner. Here we developed a retrovirus-mediated, single-cell gene knockout technique in mice and showed that the survival of new neurons is competitively regulated by their own NMDA-type glutamate receptor during a short, critical period soon after neuronal birth. This finding indicates that the survival of new neurons and the resulting formation of new circuits are regulated in an input-dependent, cell-specific manner. Therefore, the circuits formed by new neurons may represent information associated with input activity within a short time window in the critical period. This information-specific addition of new circuits through selective survival or death of new neurons may be a unique attribute of new neurons that enables them to play a critical role in learning and memory.","Salk Inst Biol Studies, Genet Lab, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA","Gage, FH (reprint author), Salk Inst Biol Studies, Genet Lab, 10010 N Torrey Pines Rd, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA.",gage@salk.edu,"Tashiro, Ayumu/A-2675-2008; Toni, Nicolas/M-2057-2014","Toni, Nicolas/0000-0001-5585-268X",,,,30,351,369,2,18,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,24-Aug,2006,442,7105,,,,,929,933,,10.1038/nature05028,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,076LT,WOS:000239960500040,16906136,No,,,11/20/17

Although this repertoire may seem modest, it provides animals with critical information about the nature and quality of food. Sour taste detection functions as an important sensory input to warn against the ingestion of acidic ( for example, spoiled or unripe) food sources(1-3). We have used a combination of bioinformatics, genetic and functional studies to identify PKD2L1, a polycystic-kidney-disease-like ion channel(4), as a candidate mammalian sour taste sensor. In the tongue, PKD2L1 is expressed in a subset of taste receptor cells distinct from those responsible for sweet, bitter and umami taste. To examine the role of PKD2L1-expressing taste cells in vivo, we engineered mice with targeted genetic ablations of selected populations of taste receptor cells. Animals lacking PKD2L1-expressing cells are completely devoid of taste responses to sour stimuli. Notably, responses to all other tastants remained unaffected, proving that the segregation of taste qualities even extends to ionic stimuli. Our results now establish independent cellular substrates for four of the five basic taste modalities, and support a comprehensive labelled-line mode of taste coding at the periphery(5-10). Notably, PKD2L1 is also expressed in specific neurons surrounding the central canal of the spinal cord. Here we demonstrate that these PKD2L1-expressing neurons send projections to the central canal, and selectively trigger action potentials in response to decreases in extracellular pH. We propose that these cells correspond to the long-sought components of the cerebrospinal fluid chemosensory system(11).

Plants need nitrate for growth and store most of it in the central vacuole(1). Some members of the chloride channel (CLC) protein family, such as the torpedo-fish ClC-0 and mammalian ClC-1, are anion channels(2,3), whereas the bacterial ClC-ec1 and mammalian ClC-4 and ClC-5 have recently been characterized as Cl-/H+ exchangers with unknown cellular functions(4-6). Plant members of the CLC family are proposed to be anion channels(7,8) involved in nitrate homeostasis(9); however, direct evidence for anion transport mediated by a plant CLC is still lacking. Here we show that Arabidopsis thaliana CLCa (AtCLCa) is localized to an intracellular membrane, the tonoplast of the plant vacuole, which is amenable to electrophysiological studies, and we provide direct evidence for its anion transport ability. We demonstrate that AtCLCa is able to accumulate specifically nitrate in the vacuole and behaves as a NO3-/H+ exchanger. For the first time, to our knowledge, the transport activity of a plant CLC is revealed, the antiporter mechanism of a CLC protein is investigated in a native membrane system, and this property is directly connected with its physiological role.","CNRS, UPR 2355, Inst Sci Vegetal, F-91198 Gif Sur Yvette, France; Univ Paris 07, UFR Biol Sci Nat, F-75251 Paris 05, France; CNR, Ist Biofis, I-16149 Genoa, Italy","Barbier-Brygoo, H (reprint author), CNRS, UPR 2355, Inst Sci Vegetal, 1 Ave Terrasse, F-91198 Gif Sur Yvette, France.",brygoo@isv.cnrs-gif.fr,"BARBIER-BRYGOO, HELENE/A-8435-2013","Thomine, Sebastien/0000-0003-0045-1701",,,,28,233,235,6,91,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,24-Aug,2006,442,7105,,,,,939,942,,10.1038/nature05013,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,076LT,WOS:000239960500042,16878138,No,,,11/20/17

In eukaryotes, the first part of this process involves recognition in the endoplasmic reticulum of amino-terminal signal sequences and translocation through Sec translocons, whereas subsequent targeting to different surface locations is promoted by internal sorting signals(1). In bacteria, N-terminal signal sequences promote translocation across the cytoplasmic membrane, which surrounds the entire cell, but some proteins are nevertheless secreted in one part of the cell by poorly understood mechanisms(2,3). Here we analyse localized secretion in the Gram-positive pathogen Streptococcus pyogenes, and show that the signal sequences of two surface proteins, M protein and protein F ( PrtF), direct secretion to different subcellular regions. The signal sequence of M protein promotes secretion at the division septum, whereas that of PrtF preferentially promotes secretion at the old pole. Our work therefore shows that a signal sequence may contain information that directs the secretion of a protein to one subcellular region, in addition to its classical role in promoting secretion. This finding identifies a new level of complexity in protein translocation and emphasizes the potential of bacterial systems for the analysis of fundamental cell-biological problems(4).","Lund Univ, Dept Lab Med, SE-22362 Lund, Sweden; Lund Univ, Dept Cell & Organism Biol, SE-22362 Lund, Sweden; Lund Univ, Dept Clin Sci, SE-22362 Lund, Sweden","Lindahl, G (reprint author), Lund Univ, Dept Lab Med, SE-22362 Lund, Sweden.",gunnar.lindahl@med.lu.se,,,,,,28,76,77,0,13,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,24-Aug,2006,442,7105,,,,,943,946,,10.1038/nature05021,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,076LT,WOS:000239960500043,16929299,No,,,11/20/17

Cells begin the cell cycle with a single centrosome, which duplicates once before mitosis. During duplication, new centrioles grow orthogonally to existing ones and remain engaged ( tightly opposed) with those centrioles until late mitosis or early G1 phase, when they become disengaged(1). The relationship between centriole engagement/disengagement and centriole duplication potential is not understood, and the mechanisms that control these processes are not known. Here we show that centriole disengagement requires the protease separase(2) at anaphase, and that this disengagement licences centriole duplication in the next cell cycle. We describe an in vitro system using Xenopus egg extract and purified centrioles in which both centriole disengagement and centriole growth occur. Centriole disengagement at anaphase is independent of mitotic exit and Cdk2/cyclin E activity, but requires the anaphase-promoting complex and separase. In contrast to disengagement, new centriole growth occurs in interphase, is dependent on Cdk2/cyclin E, and requires previously disengaged centrioles. This suggests that re-duplication of centrioles within a cell cycle is prevented by centriole engagement itself. We propose that the 'once-only' control of centrosome duplication is achieved by temporally separating licensing in anaphase from growth of new centrioles during S phase. The involvement of separase in both centriole disengagement and sister chromatid separation would prevent premature centriole disengagement before anaphase onset, which can lead to multipolar spindles and genomic instability(3,4).","Stanford Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Dept Genet, Stanford, CA 94305 USA","Stearns, T (reprint author), Stanford Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",stearns@stanford.edu,,,,,,28,247,249,0,15,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,24-Aug,2006,442,7105,,,,,947,951,,10.1038/nature04985,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,076LT,WOS:000239960500044,16862117,No,,,11/20/17

First, we apply a continuous-wave oscillating magnetic field, generated on-chip, and observe electron spin resonance in spin-dependent transport measurements through the two dots. Next, we coherently control the quantum state of the electron spin by applying short bursts of the oscillating magnetic field and observe about eight oscillations of the spin state ( so-called Rabi oscillations) during a microsecond burst.

However, it is not known whether these sequence preferences have a significant influence on nucleosome position in vivo, and thus regulate the access of other proteins to DNA. Here we isolated nucleosome-bound sequences at high resolution from yeast and used these sequences in a new computational approach to construct and validate experimentally a nucleosome - DNA interaction model, and to predict the genome-wide organization of nucleosomes. Our results demonstrate that genomes encode an intrinsic nucleosome organization and that this intrinsic organization can explain similar to 50% of the in vivo nucleosome positions.

Here we identify PML as a critical inhibitor of neoangiogenesis ( the formation of new blood vessels) in vivo, in both ischaemic and neoplastic conditions, through the control of protein translation. We demonstrate that in hypoxic conditions PML acts as a negative regulator of the synthesis rate of hypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha (HIF-1 alpha) by repressing mammalian target of rapamycin ( mTOR). PML physically interacts with mTOR and negatively regulates its association with the small GTPase Rheb by favouring mTOR nuclear accumulation. Notably, Pml(-/-) cells and tumours display higher sensitivity both in vitro and in vivo to growth inhibition by rapamycin, and lack of PML inversely correlates with phosphorylation of ribosomal protein S6 and tumour angiogenesis in mouse and human tumours. Thus, our findings identify PML as a novel suppressor of mTOR and neoangiogenesis.","Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Sloan Kettering Inst, Canc Biol & Genet Program, New York, NY 10021 USA; Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Sloan Kettering Inst, Dept Pathol, New York, NY 10021 USA; Weill Cornell Med Coll, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Dept Med Genet, Div Hematol Oncol, New York, NY 10021 USA; Univ Penn, Ctr Canc, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Dept Cell & Dev Biol, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; Univ Penn, Ctr Canc, Abramson Family Canc Res Inst, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA","Pandolfi, PP (reprint author), Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Sloan Kettering Inst, Canc Biol & Genet Program, 1275 York Ave, New York, NY 10021 USA.",p-pandolfi@ski.mskcc.org,"bernardi, rosa/B-1650-2013","Bernardi, Rosa/0000-0002-3607-6336",,,,47,243,254,0,22,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,17-Aug,2006,442,7104,,,,,779,785,,10.1038/nature05029,,7,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,074DK,WOS:000239792700038,16915281,No,,,11/20/17

It remains unclear, however, over what timescales galaxies were assembled and when and how bulges and disks - the primary components of present-day galaxies - were formed. It is also puzzling that the most massive galaxies were more abundant and were forming stars more rapidly at early epochs than expected from models(4-7). Here we report high-angular-resolution observations of a representative luminous star-forming galaxy when the Universe was only 20% of its current age. A large and massive rotating protodisk is channelling gas towards a growing central stellar bulge hosting an accreting massive black hole. The high surface densities of gas, the high rate of star formation and the moderately young stellar ages suggest rapid assembly, fragmentation and conversion to stars of an initially very gas-rich protodisk, with no obvious evidence for a major merger.","Max Planck Inst Extraterr Phys, D-85748 Garching, Germany; Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Phys, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; Ist Nazl Astrofis, Osservatorio Astrofis Arcetri, I-50125 Florence, Italy; Natl Opt Astron Observ, Tucson, AZ 85719 USA; Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Astron, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; Tel Aviv Univ, Sch Phys & Astron, IL-69978 Tel Aviv, Israel; Osserv Astron Padova, I-35122 Padua, Italy; Univ Sci & Technol China, Ctr Astrophys, Hefei 230026, Peoples R China; Natl Astron Observ, Tokyo 1818588, Japan; Ist Nazl Astrofis, Osservatorio Astron Bologna, I-40129 Bologna, Italy","Genzel, R (reprint author), Max Planck Inst Extraterr Phys, Giessenbachstr 1, D-85748 Garching, Germany.",genzel@mpe.mpg.de,"Daddi, Emanuele/D-1649-2012; Mignoli, Marco/O-9426-2015","Daddi, Emanuele/0000-0002-3331-9590; Mignoli, Marco/0000-0002-9087-2835",,,,29,311,312,0,15,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,17-Aug,2006,442,7104,,,,,786,789,,10.1038/nature05052,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,074DK,WOS:000239792700039,16915282,No,,,11/20/17

The low temperature of this 'cryptic region' has been attributed to a clear slab of nearly pure CO2 ice, with the low albedo resulting from absorption by the underlying surface(4). Here we report near-infrared imaging spectroscopy of the south seasonal cap. The deep and broad CO2 absorption bands that are expected in the near-infrared with a thick transparent slab of CO2 ice are not observed. Models of the observed spectra indicate that the low albedo results from extensive dust contamination close to the surface of a CO2 ice layer, which could be linked to atmospheric circulation patterns(5,6).

Unusual dark spots, fans and blotches form as the south-polar seasonal CO2 ice cap retreats during spring and summer. Small radial channel networks are often associated with the location of spots once the ice disappears. The spots have been proposed to be simply bare, defrosted ground(1-3); the formation of the channels has remained uncertain. Here we report infrared and visible observations that show that the spots and fans remain at CO2 ice temperatures well into summer, and must be granular materials that have been brought up to the surface of the ice, requiring a complex suite of processes to get them there. We propose that the seasonal ice cap forms an impermeable, translucent slab of CO2 ice that sublimates from the base, building up high-pressure gas beneath the slab. This gas levitates the ice, which eventually ruptures, producing high-velocity CO2 vents that erupt sand-sized grains in jets to form the spots and erode the channels.

Stable localized field configurations were searched for an ingredient for a general field theory of elementary particles, but the majority of nonlinear field models were unable to predict them. As an exception, Skyrme succeeded in describing nuclear particles as localized states, so-called 'skyrmions'(2). Skyrmions are a characteristic of nonlinear continuum models ranging from microscopic to cosmological scales(3-6). Skyrmionic states have been found under non-equilibrium conditions, or when stabilized by external fields or the proliferation of topological defects. Examples are Turing patterns in classical liquids(7), spin textures in quantum Hall magnets(8), or the blue phases in liquid crystals(9). However, it has generally been assumed that skyrmions cannot form spontaneous ground states, such as ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic order, in magnetic materials. Here, we show theoretically that this assumption is wrong and that skyrmion textures may form spontaneously in condensed-matter systems with chiral interactions without the assistance of external fields or the proliferation of defects. We show this within a phenomenological continuum model based on a few material-specific parameters that can be determined experimentally. Our model has a condition not considered before: we allow for softened amplitude variations of the magnetization, characteristic of, for instance, metallic magnets. Our model implies that spontaneous skyrmion lattice ground states may exist generally in a large number of materials, notably at surfaces and in thin films, as well as in bulk compounds, where a lack of space inversion symmetry leads to chiral interactions.","IFW Dresden, D-01171 Dresden, Germany; Univ Karlsruhe, Inst Phys, D-76128 Karlsruhe, Germany; Tech Univ Munich, Phys Dept E21, D-85748 Garching, Germany; Forschungszentrum Karlsruhe, Inst Festkorperphys, D-76021 Karlsruhe, Germany; Donetsk Inst Phys & Technol, Donetsk, Ukraine","Rossler, UK (reprint author), IFW Dresden, POB 270116, D-01171 Dresden, Germany.",u.roessler@ifw-dresden.de,"Pfleiderer, Christian/P-3575-2014",,,,,29,527,528,24,333,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,17-Aug,2006,442,7104,,,,,797,801,,10.1038/nature05056,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,074DK,WOS:000239792700042,16915285,No,,,11/20/17

These 'slow slip events' have been observed in Japan(1,2), Cascadia(3-7), Mexico(8,9), Alaska(10) and New Zealand(11). The phenomenon is poorly understood, but several observations hint at the processes underlying slow slip. Although slip itself is silent, seismic instruments often record coincident low-amplitude tremor in a narrow ( 1 - 5 cycles per second) frequency range(12). Also, modelling of GPS data(3,7,9) and estimates of tremor location(13) indicate that slip focuses near the transition from unstable('stick-slip') to stable friction at the deep limit of the earthquake-producing seismogenic zone. Perhaps most intriguingly, slow slip is periodic at several locations, with recurrence varying from 6 to 18 months depending on which subduction zone ( or even segment) is examined(4-6,9). Here I show that such periodic slow fault slip may be a resonant response to climate-driven stress perturbations. Fault slip resonance helps to explain why slip events are periodic, why periods differ from place to place, and why slip focuses near the base of the seismogenic zone. Resonant slip should initiate within the rupture zone of future great earthquakes, suggesting that slow slip may illuminate fault properties that control earthquake slip.","Univ Colorado, Dept Phys, Boulder, CO 80309 USA","Lowry, AR (reprint author), Utah State Univ, Dept Geol, Logan, UT 84322 USA.",arlowry@himalaya.colorado.edu,"Lowry, Anthony/F-8158-2012","Lowry, Anthony/0000-0001-6023-3090",,,,30,39,40,1,15,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,17-Aug,2006,442,7104,,,,,802,805,,10.1038/nature05055,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,074DK,WOS:000239792700043,16915286,No,,,11/20/17

The increase in nitrate availability in soils is important for plant nutrition, but it also has considerable impact on groundwater pollution owing to leaching. Here we show that archaeal ammonia oxidizers are more abundant in soils than their well-known bacterial counterparts. We investigated the abundance of the gene encoding a subunit of the key enzyme ammonia monooxygenase (amoA) in 12 pristine and agricultural soils of three climatic zones. amoA gene copies of Crenarchaeota ( Archaea) were up to 3,000-fold more abundant than bacterial amoA genes. High amounts of crenarchaeota-specific lipids, including crenarchaeol, correlated with the abundance of archaeal amoA gene copies. Furthermore, reverse transcription quantitative PCR studies and complementary DNA analysis using novel cloning-independent pyrosequencing technology demonstrated the activity of the archaea in situ and supported the numerical dominance of archaeal over bacterial ammonia oxidizers. Our results indicate that crenarchaeota may be the most abundant ammonia-oxidizing organisms in soil ecosystems on Earth.","Univ Bergen, Dept Biol, N-5020 Bergen, Norway; GSF Natl Res Ctr Environm & Hlth, Inst Soil Ecol, D-85764 Neuherberg, Germany; Univ Cologne, Inst Geol & Mineral, D-50674 Cologne, Germany; Penn State Univ, Ctr Comparat Genom & Bioinformat, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; Univ Aberdeen, Sch Biol Sci, Aberdeen AB24 3UU, Scotland","Schleper, C (reprint author), Univ Bergen, Dept Biol, Jahnebakken 5, N-5020 Bergen, Norway.",christa.schleper@bio.uib.no,"Prosser, James/F-5280-2010; Nicol, Graeme/E-4902-2011; Ducey, Thomas/A-6493-2011; Urich, Tim/C-2887-2013; QI, JI/E-2797-2016; Urich, Tim/J-8241-2016","Prosser, James/0000-0003-1757-5102; Nicol, Graeme/0000-0002-3876-022X; ",,,,27,1177,1320,54,659,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,17-Aug,2006,442,7104,,,,,806,809,,10.1038/nature04983,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,074DK,WOS:000239792700044,16915287,No,,,11/20/17

Here we show that WAVE1 is phosphorylated at multiple sites by cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5) both in vitro and in intact mouse neurons. Phosphorylation of WAVE1 by Cdk5 inhibits its ability to regulate Arp2/3 complex-dependent actin polymerization. Loss of WAVE1 function in vivo or in cultured neurons results in a decrease in mature dendritic spines. Expression of a dephosphorylation-mimic mutant of WAVE1 reverses this loss of WAVE1 function in spine morphology, but expression of a phosphorylation-mimic mutant does not. Cyclic AMP ( cAMP) signalling reduces phosphorylation of the Cdk5 sites in WAVE1, and increases spine density in a WAVE1-dependent manner.

Eradication of these cancer stem cells is probably a critical part of any successful anti-cancer therapy, and may explain why conventional cancer therapies are often effective in reducing tumour burden, but are only rarely curative. Given that both normal and cancer stem cells are capable of self-renewal, the extent to which cancer stem cells resemble normal tissue stem cells is a critical issue if targeted therapies are to be developed. However, it remains unclear whether cancer stem cells must be phenotypically similar to normal tissue stem cells or whether they can retain the identity of committed progenitors. Here we show that leukaemia stem cells (LSC) can maintain the global identity of the progenitor from which they arose while activating a limited stem-cell- or self-renewal-associated programme. We isolated LSC from leukaemias initiated in committed granulocyte macrophage progenitors through introduction of the MLL - AF9 fusion protein encoded by the t(9; 11)(p22; q23). The LSC were capable of transferring leukaemia to secondary recipient mice when only four cells were transferred, and possessed an immunophenotype and global gene expression profile very similar to that of normal granulocyte macrophage progenitors. However, a subset of genes highly expressed in normal haematopoietic stem cells was re-activated in LSC. LSC can thus be generated from committed progenitors without widespread reprogramming of gene expression, and a leukaemia self-renewal-associated signature is activated in the process. Our findings define progression from normal progenitor to cancer stem cell, and suggest that targeting a self-renewal programme expressed in an abnormal context may be possible.","Childrens Hosp, Div Hematol Oncol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; Dana Farber Canc Inst, Dept Pediat Oncol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; Dana Farber Canc Inst, Dept Med Oncol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Brigham & Womens Hosp, Div Hematol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; Harvard Univ, Broad Inst, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; MIT, Broad Inst, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; Howard Hughes Med Inst, Chevy Chase, MD 20815 USA","Armstrong, SA (reprint author), Childrens Hosp, Div Hematol Oncol, Boston, MA 02115 USA.",Scott.Armstrong@childrens.harvard.edu,"Faber, Joerg/G-4549-2010","Krivtsov, Andrei/0000-0002-5511-1686",,,,30,790,829,6,42,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,17-Aug,2006,442,7104,,,,,818,822,,10.1038/nature04980,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,074DK,WOS:000239792700047,16862118,No,,,11/20/17

In both murine somatic and human embryonic stem cells, these positive signals are opposed by a control mechanism that involves the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase. Transient administration of Notch ligands to the brain of adult rats increases the numbers of newly generated precursor cells and improves motor skills after ischaemic injury.

A crucial example of this is photosynthesis, where solar energy is converted into electrochemical potential that drives oxygen and biomass generation at temperatures ranging from those of frigid Antarctica to those of scalding hot springs. The energy conversion proceeds by concerted mobilization of electrons and protons on photoexcitation of reaction centre protein complexes(1-3). Following physicochemical paradigms, the rates of imperative steps in this process were predicted to increase exponentially with rising temperatures, resulting in different yields of solar energy conversion at the distinct growth temperatures of photosynthetic mesophiles and extremophiles. In contrast, here we show a meticulous adjustment of energy conversion rate, resulting in similar yields from mesophiles and thermophiles. The key molecular players in the temperature adjustment process consist of a cluster of hitherto unrecognized protein cavities and an adjacent packing motif that jointly impart local flexibility crucial to the reaction centre proteins. Mutations within the packing motif of mesophiles that increase the bulkiness of the amino-acid side chains, and thus reduce the size of the cavities, promote thermophilic behaviour. This novel biomechanical mechanism accounts for the slowing of the catalytic reaction above physiological temperatures in contradiction to the classical Arrhenius paradigm. The mechanism provides new guidelines for manipulating the acclimatization of enzymes to the ambient temperatures of diverse habitats. More generally, it reveals novel protein elements that are of potential significance for modulating structure - activity relationships in membrane and globular proteins alike.","Weizmann Inst Sci, Dept Plant Sci, IL-76100 Rehovot, Israel","Scherz, A (reprint author), Weizmann Inst Sci, Dept Plant Sci, IL-76100 Rehovot, Israel.",Avigdor.Scherz@weizmann.ac.il,"samish, ilan/B-7980-2016","samish, ilan/0000-0002-0299-9124",,,,30,30,30,0,14,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,17-Aug,2006,442,7104,,,,,827,830,,10.1038/nature04947,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,074DK,WOS:000239792700049,16862124,No,,,11/20/17

Chronic infection is common and can lead to cirrhosis and liver cancer. There is no vaccine available and current therapies have met with limited success(2). The viral RNA genome encodes a polyprotein that includes two proteases essential for virus replication(3,4). The NS2-3 protease mediates a single cleavage at the NS2/NS3 junction, whereas the NS3-4A protease cleaves at four downstream sites in the polyprotein. NS3-4A is characterized as a serine protease with a chymotrypsin-like fold(5,6), but the enzymatic mechanism of the NS2-3 protease remains unresolved(7-9). Here we report the crystal structure of the catalytic domain of the NS2-3 protease at 2.3 angstrom resolution. The structure reveals a dimeric cysteine protease with two composite active sites. For each active site, the catalytic histidine and glutamate residues are contributed by one monomer, and the nucleophilic cysteine by the other. The carboxy-terminal residues remain coordinated in the two active sites, predicting an inactive post-cleavage form. Proteolysis through formation of a composite active site occurs in the context of the viral polyprotein expressed in mammalian cells. These features offer unexpected insights into polyprotein processing by hepatitis C virus and new opportunities for antiviral drug design.","Rockefeller Univ, Ctr Study Hepatitis C, Lab Virol & Infect Dis, New York, NY 10021 USA","Rice, CM (reprint author), Rockefeller Univ, Ctr Study Hepatitis C, Lab Virol & Infect Dis, 1230 York Ave, New York, NY 10021 USA.",marcotj@rockefeller.edu; ricec@rockefeller.edu,"Marcotrigiano, Joseph /K-6697-2016","Marcotrigiano, Joseph /0000-0003-0346-3353",,,,29,123,131,2,19,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,17-Aug,2006,442,7104,,,,,831,835,,10.1038/nature04975,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,074DK,WOS:000239792700050,16862121,No,,,11/20/17

Simple physical intuition predicts that DNA should unwind under tension, as it is pulled towards a denatured structure(4-8). We used rotor bead tracking to directly measure twist - stretch coupling in single DNA molecules. Here we show that for small distortions, contrary to intuition, DNA overwinds under tension, reaching a maximum twist at a tension of similar to 30 pN. As tension is increased above this critical value, the DNA begins to unwind. The observed twist - stretch coupling predicts that DNA should also lengthen when overwound under constant tension, an effect that we quantitatively confirm. We present a simple model that explains these unusual mechanical properties, and also suggests a possible origin for the anomalously large torsional rigidity of DNA. Our results have implications for the action of DNA-binding proteins that must stretch and twist DNA to compensate for variability in the lengths of their binding sites(9-11).

Genes encoding these receptors, called ' trace amine- associated receptors' ( TAARs), are present in human, mouse and fish. Like odorant receptors, individual mouse TAARs are expressed in unique subsets of neurons dispersed in the epithelium. Notably, at least three mouse TAARs recognize volatile amines found in urine: one detects a compound linked to stress, whereas the other two detect compounds enriched in male versus female urine - one of which is reportedly a pheromone. The evolutionary conservation of the TAAR family suggests a chemosensory function distinct from odorant receptors.

Here we identify Card9 as a key transducer of Dectin- 1 signalling. Although being dispensable for TLR/ MyD88- induced responses, Card9 controls Dectin- 1- mediated myeloid cell activation, cytokine production and innate anti- fungal immunity. Card9 couples to Bcl10 and regulates Bcl10 - Malt1- mediated NF- kappa B activation induced by zymosan. Yet, Card9 is dispensable for antigen receptor signalling that uses Carma1 as a link to Bcl10 - Malt1.

When the measured density of baryons ( ordinary matter) is combined with standard Big Bang nucleosynthesis calculations(2,3), the amounts of hydrogen, helium and lithium produced shortly after the Big Bang can be predicted with unprecedented precision(1,4). The predicted primordial lithium abundance is a factor of two to three higher than the value measured in the atmospheres of old stars(5,6). With estimated errors of 10 to 25%, this cosmological lithium discrepancy seriously challenges our understanding of stellar physics, Big Bang nucleosynthesis or both. Certain modifications to nucleosynthesis have been proposed(7), but found experimentally not to be viable(8). Diffusion theory, however, predicts atmospheric abundances of stars to vary with time(9), which offers a possible explanation of the discrepancy. Here we report spectroscopic observations of stars in the metal-poor globular cluster NGC6397 that reveal trends of atmospheric abundance with evolutionary stage for various elements. These element- specific trends are reproduced by stellar- evolution models with diffusion and turbulent mixing(10). We thus conclude that diffusion is predominantly responsible for the low apparent stellar lithium abundance in the atmospheres of old stars by transporting the lithium deep into the star.","Uppsala Univ, Dept Space Phys & Astron, S-75120 Uppsala, Sweden; Univ Aarhus, Dept Phys & Astron, DK-8000 Aarhus, Denmark; Univ Montpellier 2, CNRS, ISTEEM, UMR5024,GRAAL, F-34095 Montpellier, France; Russian Acad Sci, Inst Astron, Moscow 119017, Russia","Korn, AJ (reprint author), Uppsala Univ, Dept Space Phys & Astron, Box 515, S-75120 Uppsala, Sweden.",akorn@astro.uu.se,"Richard, Olivier/B-9301-2012","Richard, Olivier/0000-0002-0342-5093; Collet, Remo/0000-0001-6093-8402; Korn, Andreas/0000-0002-3881-6756",,,,30,188,191,0,5,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,10-Aug,2006,442,7103,,,,,657,659,,10.1038/nature05011,,3,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,071UU,WOS:000239630200038,16900193,No,,,11/20/17

This description underpins our understanding of the macroscopic optical properties of solids, liquids and plasmas, as well as of their dispersion with frequency. In ferroelectric materials, terahertz radiation propagates by driving infrared- active lattice vibrations, resulting in phononpolariton waves. Electro- optic sampling with femtosecond optical pulses(3-5) can measure the time- dependent electrical polarization, providing a phase- sensitive analogue to optical Raman scattering(6,7). Here we use femtosecond time- resolved X- ray diffraction(8-10), a phase- sensitive analogue to inelastic X- ray scattering(11-13), to measure the corresponding displacements of ions in ferroelectric lithium tantalate, LiTaO3. Amplitude and phase of all degrees of freedom in a light field are thus directly measured in the time domain.

The 2e charge quantum is clearly visible in the height of voltage steps in Josephson junctions under microwave irradiation, and in the magnetic flux periodicity of h/ 2e ( where h is Planck's constant) in superconducting quantum interference devices(2). Here we study supercurrents through a quantum dot created in a semiconductor nanowire by local electrostatic gating. Owing to strong Coulomb interaction, electrons only tunnel one- by- one through the discrete energy levels of the quantum dot. This nevertheless can yield a supercurrent when subsequent tunnel events are coherent(3-7). These quantum coherent tunnelling processes can result in either a positive or a negative supercurrent, that is, in a normal or a pi-junction(8-10), respectively. We demonstrate that the supercurrent reverses sign by adding a single electron spin to the quantum dot. When excited states of the quantum dot are involved in transport, the supercurrent sign also depends on the character of the orbital wavefunctions.","Delft Univ Technol, Kavli Inst Nanosci, NL-2600 GA Delft, Netherlands; Philips Res Labs, NL-5656 AE Eindhoven, Netherlands; CNR, INFM, Lab Nazl TASC, I-34012 Trieste, Italy","Kouwenhoven, LP (reprint author), Delft Univ Technol, Kavli Inst Nanosci, POB 5046, NL-2600 GA Delft, Netherlands.",L.P.Kouwenhoven@TUDelft.nl,"Nazarov, Yuli/F-6511-2011",,,,,29,248,249,7,53,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,10-Aug,2006,442,7103,,,,,667,670,,10.1038/nature05018,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,071UU,WOS:000239630200041,16900196,No,,,11/20/17

This warming is associated with a severe shoaling of the ocean calcite compensation depth(4) and a > 2.5 per mil negative carbon isotope excursion in marine and soil carbonates(1-4). Together these observations indicate a massive release of C-13- depleted carbon(4) and greenhouse- gas-induced warming. Recently, sediments were recovered from the central Arctic Ocean(5), providing the first opportunity to evaluate the environmental response at the North Pole at this time. Here we present stable hydrogen and carbon isotope measurements of terrestrial- plant- and aquatic- derived n- alkanes that record changes in hydrology, including surface water salinity and precipitation, and the global carbon cycle. Hydrogen isotope records are interpreted as documenting decreased rainout during moisture transport from lower latitudes and increased moisture delivery to the Arctic at the onset of the Palaeocene/ Eocene thermal maximum, consistent with predictions of poleward storm track migrations during global warming(6). The terrestrial- plant carbon isotope excursion ( about -4.5 to -6 per mil) is substantially larger than those of marine carbonates. Previously, this offset was explained by the physiological response of plants to increases in surface humidity(2). But this mechanism is not an effective explanation in this wet Arctic setting, leading us to hypothesize that the true magnitude of the excursion - and associated carbon input was greater than originally surmised. Greater carbon release and strong hydrological cycle feedbacks may help explain the maintenance of this unprecedented warmth.","Yale Univ, Dept Geol & Geophys, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; Purdue Univ, Dept Earth & Atmospher Sci, W Lafayette, IN 47906 USA; Purdue Univ, Purdue Climate Change Res Ctr, W Lafayette, IN 47906 USA; Univ Utrecht, Inst Environm Biol, Palaeobot & Palynol Lab, NL-3584 CD Utrecht, Netherlands; Royal Netherlands Inst Sea Res NIOZ, Dept Marine Biogeochem & Toxicol, NL-1790 AB Den Burg, Texel, Netherlands; Univ Utrecht, Dept Earth Sci, Fac Geosci, NL-3584 CD Utrecht, Netherlands; Rice Univ, Dept Earth Sci, Houston, TX 77005 USA","Pagani, M (reprint author), Yale Univ, Dept Geol & Geophys, POB 208109, New Haven, CT 06520 USA.",mark.pagani@yale.edu,"; Palike, Heiko/A-6560-2008; Huber, Matthew/A-7677-2008; O'Regan, Matt/B-2157-2010; Jakobsson, Martin/F-6214-2010; Pedentchouk, Nikolai/C-9935-2011; Brinkhuis, Henk/B-4223-2009; Dickens, Gerald/G-1222-2011; Pagani, Mark/B-3233-2008; Kaminski, Michael/K-3334-2012; Sinninghe Damste, Jaap/F-6128-2011; Sluijs, Appy/B-3726-2009","Eynaud, Frederique/0000-0003-1283-7425; Jakobsson, Martin/0000-0002-9033-3559; O'Regan, Matt/0000-0002-6046-1488; Onodera, Jonaotaro/0000-0001-6942-2285; Palike, Heiko/0000-0003-3386-0923; Huber, Matthew/0000-0002-2771-9977; Sinninghe Damste, Jaap/0000-0002-8683-1854; Sluijs, Appy/0000-0003-2382-0215; Pedentchouk, Nikolai/0000-0002-2923-966X",,,,31,225,233,9,96,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,10-Aug,2006,442,7103,,,,,671,675,,10.1038/nature05043,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,071UU,WOS:000239630200042,16906647,No,,,11/20/17

How this melt is extracted and focused to the volcanoes, however, remains an unresolved question. Here we present new theoretical results with implications for melt focusing beneath mid- ocean ridges. By modelling laboratory experiments(1,2), we test a formulation for magma dynamics and provide an explanation for localized bands of high- porosity and concentrated shear deformation observed in experiments. These bands emerge and persist at 15 degrees - 25 degrees to the plane of shear. Past theoretical work on this system predicted the emergence of melt bands(3,4) but at an angle inconsistent with experiments. Our results suggest that the observed band angle results from a balance of porosity- weakening and strain- rate- weakening deformation mechanisms. Lower band angles are predicted for greater strain-rate weakening. From these lower band angles, we estimate the orientation of melt bands beneath mid- ocean ridges and show that they may enhance magma focusing toward the ridge axis.","Columbia Univ, Lamont Doherty Earth Observ, Palisades, NY 10964 USA; Columbia Univ, Dept Appl Phys & Appl Math, New York, NY 10027 USA","Katz, RF (reprint author), Columbia Univ, Lamont Doherty Earth Observ, Palisades, NY 10964 USA.",katz@ldeo.columbia.edu,"Holtzman, Benjamin/E-8423-2010; Katz, Richard/D-3364-2009","Katz, Richard/0000-0001-8746-5430",,,,24,124,130,1,36,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,10-Aug,2006,442,7103,,,,,676,679,,10.1038/nature05039,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,071UU,WOS:000239630200043,16900197,No,,,11/20/17

However, the potential of this material has not been fully realized because of reliance on traditional, non- destructive methods that allow analysis of exposed surfaces only(1-4), and destructive methods that preserve only a single two- dimensional view of the interior of the specimen(5,6). Here, we have applied synchrotron- radiation X- ray tomographic microscopy ( SRXTM)(7), obtaining complete three-dimensional recordings at submicrometre resolution. The embryos are preserved by early diagenetic impregnation and encrustation with calcium phosphate, and differences in X- ray attenuation provide information about the distribution of these two diagenetic phases. Three- dimensional visualization of blastomere arrangement and diagenetic cement in cleavage embryos resolves outstanding questions about their nature, including the identity of the columnar blastomeres. The anterior and posterior anatomy of embryos of the bilaterian worm- like Markuelia confirms its position as a scalidophoran, providing new insights into body- plan assembly among constituent phyla. The structure of the developing germ band in another bilaterian, Pseudooides, indicates a unique mode of germ- band development. SRXTM provides a method of non- invasive analysis that rivals the resolution achieved even by destructive methods, probing the very limits of fossilization and providing insight into embryology during the emergence of metazoan phyla.","Univ Bristol, Dept Earth Sci, Bristol BS8 1RJ, Avon, England; Swedish Museum Nat Hist, Dept Palaeozool, S-10405 Stockholm, Sweden; Peking Univ, Sch Earth & Space Sci, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China; Dept Earth & Ocean Sci, Liverpool L69 3GP, Merseyside, England; Chinese Acad Geol Sci, Inst Geol, Beijing, Peoples R China; Paul Scherrer Inst, Swiss Light Source, CH-5232 Villigen, Switzerland","Donoghue, PCJ (reprint author), Univ Bristol, Dept Earth Sci, Bristol BS8 1RJ, Avon, England.",phil.donoghue@bristol.ac.uk; marco.stampanoni@psi.ch,"Donoghue, Philip/A-3873-2008; Dong, Xi-ping/N-5741-2014; Stampanoni, Marco/J-4099-2013","Dong, Xi-ping/0000-0001-5917-7159; Stampanoni, Marco/0000-0001-7486-6681; Bengtson, Stefan/0000-0003-0206-5791; Donoghue, Philip/0000-0003-3116-7463",,,,28,164,181,4,31,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,10-Aug,2006,442,7103,,,,,680,683,,10.1038/nature04890,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,071UU,WOS:000239630200044,16900198,No,,,11/20/17

Comparison of Hox and ParaHox genes has led workers to postulate that both clusters originated from the duplication of an ancient cluster named ProtoHox, which contained up to four genes with at least the precursors of anterior and posterior Hox/ ParaHox genes(1-3). However, the way in which genes diversified within the ProtoHox, Hox and ParaHox clusters remains unclear because no systematic study of non- bilaterian animals exists. Here we characterize the full Hox/ ParaHox gene complements and genomic organization in two cnidarian species ( Nematostella vectensis and Hydra magnipapillata), and suggest a ProtoHox cluster simpler than originally thought on the basis of three arguments. First, both species possess bilaterian- like anterior Hox genes, but their non-anterior genes do not appear as counterparts of either bilaterian central or posterior genes; second, two clustered ParaHox genes, Gsx and a gene related to Xlox and Cdx, are found in Nematostella vectensis; and third, we do not find clear phylogenetic support for a common origin of bilaterian Cdx and posterior genes, which might therefore have appeared after the ProtoHox cluster duplication. Consequently, the ProtoHox cluster might have consisted of only two anterior genes. Non- anterior genes could have appeared independently in the Hox and ParaHox clusters, possibly after the separation of bilaterians and cnidarians.","Univ Bergen, Sars Inst Ctr Marine Mol Biol, N-5008 Bergen, Norway; Univ Montpellier 2, CNRS, UMR5554,Inst Sci Evolut, Lab Paleontol Phylogenie & Paleobiol, F-34095 Montpellier 05, France; Amer Hosp Paris, F-92202 Neuilly Sur Seine, France; Childrens Hosp & Res Ctr Oakland, Oakland, CA 94609 USA; Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Biol Chem, Irvine, CA 92697 USA","Chourrout, D (reprint author), Univ Bergen, Sars Inst Ctr Marine Mol Biol, Thormoehlengst 55, N-5008 Bergen, Norway.",Daniel.chourrout@sars.uib.no; Ulrich.technau@sars.uib.no,"Delsuc, Frederic/B-4381-2009","Delsuc, Frederic/0000-0002-6501-6287; Edvardsen, Rolf/0000-0001-8430-8042; Technau, Ulrich/0000-0003-4472-8258",,,,20,120,122,2,18,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,10-Aug,2006,442,7103,,,,,684,687,,10.1038/nature04863,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,071UU,WOS:000239630200045,16900199,No,,,11/20/17

In zebrafish, the onset of liver specification is marked by the localized endodermal expression of hhex and prox1 at 22 hours post fertilization. Here we used a screen for mutations affecting endodermal organ morphogenesis to identify a unique phenotype: prometheus ( prt) mutants exhibit profound, though transient, defects in liver specification. Positional cloning reveals that prt encodes a previously unidentified Wnt2b homologue. prt/ wnt2bb is expressed in restricted bilateral domains in the lateral plate mesoderm directly adjacent to the liver- forming endoderm. Mosaic analyses show the requirement for Prt/ Wnt2bb in the lateral plate mesoderm, in agreement with the inductive properties of Wnt signalling.

However, a direct causal link between the activity of face- selective neurons and face perception has not been demonstrated. In the present study of macaque monkeys, we artificially activated small clusters of IT neurons by means of electrical microstimulation while the monkeys performed a categorization task, judging whether noisy visual images belonged to ' face ' or ' non- face' categories. Here we show that microstimulation of face-selective sites, but not other sites, strongly biased the monkeys' decisions towards the face category. The magnitude of the effect depended upon the degree of face selectivity of the stimulation site, the size of the stimulated cluster of face- selective neurons, and the exact timing of microstimulation.

We previously demonstrated that human SREBPs bind the CREB- binding protein ( CBP)/ p300 acetyltransferase KIX domain and recruit activator- recruited co- factor ( ARC)/ Mediator co- activator complexes through unknown mechanisms(3-5). Here we show that SREBPs use the evolutionarily conserved ARC105 ( also called MED15) subunit to activate target genes. Structural analysis of the SREBP- binding domain in ARC105 by NMR revealed a three- helix bundle with marked similarity to the CBP/ p300 KIX domain. In contrast to SREBPs, the CREB and c- Myb activators do not bind the ARC105 KIX domain, although they interact with the CBP KIX domain, revealing a surprising specificity among structurally related activator- binding domains. The Caenorhabditis elegans SREBP homologue SBP- 1 promotes fatty acid homeostasis by regulating the expression of lipogenic enzymes(6,7). We found that, like SBP- 1, the C. elegans ARC105 homologue MDT- 15 is required for fatty acid homeostasis, and show that both SBP- 1 and MDT- 15 control transcription of genes governing desaturation of stearic acid to oleic acid. Notably, dietary addition of oleic acid significantly rescued various defects of nematodes targeted with RNA interference against sbp- 1 and mdt- 15, including impaired intestinal fat storage, infertility, decreased size and slow locomotion, suggesting that regulation of oleic acid levels represents a physiologically critical function of SBP- 1 and MDT- 15. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that ARC105 is a key effector of SREBP-dependent gene regulation and control of lipid homeostasis in metazoans.","Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Ctr Canc, Charlestown, MA 02129 USA; Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Biol Chem & Mol Pharmacol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Pathol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; Washington State Univ, Inst Biol Chem, Pullman, WA 99164 USA; Harvard Univ, Bauer Ctr Genom Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mol & Cell Biol, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA","Naar, AM (reprint author), Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Ctr Canc, Bldg 149,13th St, Charlestown, MA 02129 USA.",naar@helix.mgh.harvard.edu,"van den Heuvel, Sander/B-8892-2011","van den Heuvel, Sander/0000-0001-9015-7463; Iyer, Lakshmanan/0000-0001-9167-6396","NCI NIH HHS [R01 CA127990]; NIDDK NIH HHS [R01 DK074114, R01 DK074114-01]",,,30,187,224,0,13,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,10-Aug,2006,442,7103,,,,,700,704,,10.1038/nature04942,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,071UU,WOS:000239630200049,16799563,No,,,11/20/17

A few cultivars, such as the O. sativa ssp. indica cultivar FR13A, are highly tolerant and survive up to two weeks of complete submergence owing to a major quantitative trait locus designated Submergence 1 ( Sub1) near the centromere of chromosome 9 ( refs 3 - 6). Here we describe the identification of a cluster of three genes at the Sub1 locus, encoding putative ethylene response factors. Two of these genes, Sub1B and Sub1C, are invariably present in the Sub1 region of all rice accessions analysed. In contrast, the presence of Sub1A is variable. A survey identified two alleles within those indica varieties that possess this gene: a tolerance- specific allele named Sub1A- 1 and an intolerance- specific allele named Sub1A- 2. Overexpression of Sub1A- 1 in a submergence- intolerant O. sativa ssp. japonica conferred enhanced tolerance to the plants, downregulation of Sub1C and upregulation of Alcohol dehydrogenase 1 ( Adh1), indicating that Sub1A- 1 is a primary determinant of submergence tolerance. The FR13A Sub1 locus was introgressed into a widely grown Asian rice cultivar using marker- assisted selection. The new variety maintains the high yield and other agronomic properties of the recurrent parent and is tolerant to submergence. Cultivation of this variety is expected to provide protection against damaging floods and increase crop security for farmers.","Univ Calif Davis, Dept Plant Pathol, Davis, CA 95616 USA; Univ Calif Riverside, Dept Bot & Plant Sci, Ctr Plant Cell Biol, Riverside, CA 92521 USA; Int Rice Res Inst, Manila, Philippines","Ronald, PC (reprint author), Univ Calif Davis, Dept Plant Pathol, Davis, CA 95616 USA.",pcronald@ucdavis.edu; d.mackill@cgiar.org,"Fukao, Takeshi/H-6548-2016","Fukao, Takeshi/0000-0002-9930-1318; Mackill, David/0000-0003-4224-6781; Bailey-Serres, Julia/0000-0002-8568-7125",,,,30,567,638,5,149,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,10-Aug,2006,442,7103,,,,,705,708,,10.1038/nature04920,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,071UU,WOS:000239630200050,16900200,No,,,11/20/17

Although microtubules are known to self- assemble from tubulin dimers, information on the assembly dynamics of microtubules has been limited, both in vitro(2,3) and in vivo(4,5), to measurements of average growth and shrinkage rates over several thousands of tubulin subunits. As a result there is a lack of information on the sequence of molecular events that leads to the growth and shrinkage of microtubule ends. Here we use optical tweezers to observe the assembly dynamics of individual microtubules at molecular resolution. We find that microtubules can increase their overall length almost instantaneously by amounts exceeding the size of individual dimers ( 8 nm). When the microtubule- associated protein XMAP215 ( ref. 6) is added, this effect is markedly enhanced and fast increases in length of about 40 - 60 nm are observed. These observations suggest that small tubulin oligomers are able to add directly to growing microtubules and that XMAP215 speeds up microtubule growth by facilitating the addition of long oligomers. The achievement of molecular resolution on the microtubule assembly process opens the way to direct studies of the molecular mechanism by which the many recently discovered microtubule end-binding proteins regulate microtubule dynamics in living cells(7-9).","FOM, Inst Atom & Mol Phys, AMOLF, Fdn Fundamental Res Matter, NL-1098 SJ Amsterdam, Netherlands; Max Planck Inst Mol Cell Biol & Genet, D-01307 Dresden, Germany; Univ Penn, Dept Cell & Dev Biol, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA","Dogterom, M (reprint author), FOM, Inst Atom & Mol Phys, AMOLF, Fdn Fundamental Res Matter, Kruislaan 407, NL-1098 SJ Amsterdam, Netherlands.",dogterom@amolf.nl,,,,,,30,297,302,7,74,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,10-Aug,2006,442,7103,,,,,709,712,,10.1038/nature04928,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,071UU,WOS:000239630200051,16799566,No,,,11/20/17

Unfortunately, serious contradictions remain on smaller, galactic scales(1,2). Among the main small-scale problems is a significant and persistent discrepancy between observations of nearby galaxies, which imply that galactic dark matter haloes have a density profile with a flat core(3-6), and the cosmological model, which predicts that the haloes should have divergent density ( a cusp) at the centre(7,8). Here we report numerical simulations that show that random bulk motions of gas in small primordial galaxies, of the magnitude expected in these systems, will result in a flattening of the central dark matter cusp on relatively short timescales (similar to 10(8) years). Gas bulk motions in early galaxies are driven by supernova explosions that result from ongoing star formation. Our mechanism is general, and would have operated in all star-forming galaxies at redshifts z >= 10. Once removed, the cusp cannot be reintroduced during the subsequent mergers involved in the build-up of larger galaxies(9,10). As a consequence, in the present Universe both small and large galaxies would have flat dark matter core density profiles, in agreement with observations.","McMaster Univ, Dept Phys & Astron, Hamilton, ON L8S 4M1, Canada","Mashchenko, S (reprint author), McMaster Univ, Dept Phys & Astron, Hamilton, ON L8S 4M1, Canada.",syam@physics.mcmaster.ca,,,,,,30,174,174,0,3,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,3-Aug,2006,442,7102,,,,,539,542,,10.1038/nature04944,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,069NQ,WOS:000239455900037,16885978,No,,,11/20/17

These stars can engulf their sub-stellar companions when they become red giants. This interaction may explain several outstanding problems in astrophysics(1-5) but it is unclear under what conditions a low mass companion will evaporate, survive the interaction unchanged or gain mass(1,4,5). Observational tests of models for this interaction have been hampered by a lack of positively identified remnants that is, white dwarf stars with close, sub-stellar companions. The companion to the pre-white dwarf AA Doradus may be a brown dwarf, but the uncertain history of this star and the extreme luminosity difference between the components make it difficult to interpret the observations or to put strong constraints on the models(6,7). The magnetic white dwarf SDSS J121209.31+013627.7 may have a close brown dwarf companion(8) but little is known about this binary at present.

For conventional superconductors, tunnelling spectroscopy has established that pairing is mediated by bosonic modes (phonons); a peak in the second derivative of tunnel current d(2)I/dV(2) corresponds to each phonon mode(1-3). For high-transition-temperature (high-T-c) superconductivity, however, no boson mediating electron pairing has been identified. One explanation could be that electron pair formation(4) and related electron - boson interactions are heterogeneous at the atomic scale and therefore challenging to characterize. However, with the latest advances in d(2)I/dV(2) spectroscopy using scanning tunnelling microscopy, it has become possible to study bosonic modes directly at the atomic scale(5). Here we report d(2)I/dV(2) imaging(6-8) studies of the high-T-c superconductor Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+delta. We find intense disorder of electron - boson interaction energies at the nanometre scale, along with the expected modulations in d(2) I/dV(2) ( refs 9, 10). Changing the density of holes has minimal effects on both the average mode energies and the modulations, indicating that the bosonic modes are unrelated to electronic or magnetic structure. Instead, the modes appear to be local lattice vibrations, as substitution of O-18 for O-16 throughout the material reduces the average mode energy by approximately 6 per cent - the expected effect of this isotope substitution on lattice vibration frequencies(5). Significantly, the mode energies are always spatially anticorrelated with the superconducting pairing-gap energies, suggesting an interplay between these lattice vibration modes and the superconductivity.","Cornell Univ, Dept Phys, LASSP, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; Univ Tokyo, Dept Phys, Tokyo 1138656, Japan; Univ Calif Berkeley, Lawrence Berkeley Lab, Div Mat Sci, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; AIST, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058568, Japan; Osaka Univ, Dept Phys, Osaka 5600043, Japan; Los Alamos Natl Lab, Div Theoret, Los Alamos, NM 87545 USA","Davis, JC (reprint author), Cornell Univ, Dept Phys, LASSP, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",jcdavis@ccmr.cornell.edu,"mcelroy, kyle/D-1816-2013","Zhu, Jianxin/0000-0001-7991-3918",,,,32,249,250,3,49,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,3-Aug,2006,442,7102,,,,,546,550,,10.1038/nature04973,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,069NQ,WOS:000239455900039,16885980,No,,,11/20/17

In contrast, traditional man-made optical systems achieve focusing by physical displacement of the lenses used. But in recent years, advances in miniaturization technology have led to optical systems that no longer require complicated mechanical systems to tune and adjust optical performance. These systems have found wide use in photonics, displays and biomedical systems. They are either based on arrays of microlenses with fixed focal lengths(2-5), or use external control to adjust the microlens focal length(6-12). An intriguing example is the tunable liquid lens, where electrowetting or external pressure manipulates the shape of a liquid droplet and thereby adjusts its optical properties. Here we demonstrate a liquid lens system that allows for autonomous focusing. The central component is a stimuli-responsive hydrogel(13) integrated into a microfluidic system and serving as the container for a liquid droplet, with the hydrogel simultaneously sensing the presence of stimuli and actuating adjustments to the shape - and hence focal length - of the droplet. By working at the micrometre scale where ionic diffusion and surface tension scale favourably(14), we can use pinned liquid - liquid interfaces to obtain stable devices and realize response times of ten to a few tens of seconds. The microlenses, which can have a focal length ranging from -infinity to +infinity ( divergent and convergent), are also readily integrated into arrays that may find use in applications such as sensing, medical diagnostics and lab-on-a-chip technologies(15-19).","Univ Wisconsin, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Madison, WI 53706 USA; Univ Wisconsin, Dept Biomed Engn, Madison, WI 53706 USA","Jiang, HR (reprint author), Univ Wisconsin, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, 1415 Johnson Dr, Madison, WI 53706 USA.",hongrui@engr.wisc.edu,,,,,,30,541,550,28,438,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,3-Aug,2006,442,7102,,,,,551,554,,10.1038/nature05024,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,069NQ,WOS:000239455900040,16885981,No,,,11/20/17

Our understanding of the factors that control carbon turnover in water-limited ecosystems is limited, however, as studies of litter decomposition have shown contradictory results and only a modest correlation with precipitation(2-5). Here we evaluate the influence of solar radiation, soil biotic activity and soil resource availability on litter decomposition in the semi-arid Patagonian steppe using the results of manipulative experiments carried out under ambient conditions of rainfall and temperature. We show that intercepted solar radiation was the only factor that had a significant effect on the decomposition of organic matter, with attenuation of ultraviolet-B and total radiation causing a 33 and 60 per cent reduction in decomposition, respectively. We conclude that photodegradation is a dominant control on above-ground litter decomposition in this semi-arid ecosystem. Losses through photochemical mineralization may represent a short-circuit in the carbon cycle, with a substantial fraction of carbon fixed in plant biomass being lost directly to the atmosphere without cycling through soil organic matter pools. Furthermore, future changes in radiation interception due to decreased cloudiness, increased stratospheric ozone depletion, or reduced vegetative cover may have a more significant effect on the carbon balance in these water-limited ecosystems than changes in temperature or precipitation.","Univ Buenos Aires, Inst Invest Fisiol & Ecol Vinculadas Agr, RA-1417 Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; Univ Buenos Aires, Fac Agron, CONICET, RA-1417 Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina","Austin, AT (reprint author), Univ Buenos Aires, Inst Invest Fisiol & Ecol Vinculadas Agr, Av San Martin 4453, RA-1417 Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina.",austin@ifeva.edu.ar,"Austin, Amy/E-7988-2011","Austin, Amy/0000-0002-7468-5861",,,,30,315,355,13,194,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,3-Aug,2006,442,7102,,,,,555,558,,10.1038/nature05038,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,069NQ,WOS:000239455900041,16885982,No,,,11/20/17

Despite this absence from the rock record, low Archaean geothermal gradients are suggested by eclogitic nodules in kimberlites(5,6) and circumstantial evidence for subduction processes, including possible accretion-related structures(2), has been reported in Archaean terrains. The lack of spatially and temporally well-constrained high-pressure, low-temperature metamorphism continues, however, to cast doubt on the relevance of subduction-driven tectonics during the first 1.5 Gyr of the Earth's history(7). Here we report garnet-albite-bearing mineral assemblages that record pressures of 1.2 - 1.5 GPa at temperatures of 600 - 650 degrees C from supracrustal amphibolites from the mid-Archaean Barberton granitoid-greenstone terrain. These conditions point to apparent geothermal gradients of 12 - 15 degrees C - similar to those found in recent subduction zones - that coincided with the main phase of terrane accretion in the structurally overlying Barberton greenstone belt(8). These high-pressure, low-temperature conditions represent metamorphic evidence for cold and strong lithosphere, as well as subduction-driven tectonic processes, during the evolution of the early Earth.","Univ Stellenbosch, Dept Geol, ZA-7602 Matieland, South Africa","Moyen, JF (reprint author), Univ Stellenbosch, Dept Geol, South Africa Private Bag X-1, ZA-7602 Matieland, South Africa.",moyen@sun.ac.za; gs@sun.ac.za,"Moyen, Jean-Francois/E-2043-2012; Stevens, Gary/I-2622-2014","Stevens, Gary/0000-0003-1593-9419",,,,24,125,129,4,34,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,3-Aug,2006,442,7102,,,,,559,562,,10.1038/nature04972,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,069NQ,WOS:000239455900042,16885983,No,,,11/20/17

Thus, ground finches have deep and wide beaks, cactus finches have long and pointed beaks ( low depth and narrower width), and warbler finches have slender and pointed beaks, reflecting differences in their respective diets(6). Previous work has shown that even small differences in any of the three major dimensions ( depth, width and length) of the beak have major consequences for the overall fitness of the birds(3-7). Recently we used a candidate gene approach to explain one pathway involved in Darwin's finch beak morphogenesis(8). However, this type of analysis is limited to molecules with a known association with craniofacial and/or skeletogenic development. Here we use a less constrained, complementary DNA microarray analysis of the transcripts expressed in the beak primordia to find previously unknown genes and pathways whose expression correlates with specific beak morphologies. We show that calmodulin (CaM), a molecule involved in mediating Ca2+ signalling, is expressed at higher levels in the long and pointed beaks of cactus finches than in more robust beak types of other species. We validated this observation with in situ hybridizations. When this upregulation of the CaM-dependent pathway is artificially replicated in the chick frontonasal prominence, it causes an elongation of the upper beak, recapitulating the beak morphology of the cactus finches. Our results indicate that local upregulation of the CaM-dependent pathway is likely to have been a component of the evolution of Darwin's finch species with elongated beak morphology and provide a mechanistic explanation for the independence of beak evolution along different axes. More generally, our results implicate the CaM-dependent pathway in the developmental regulation of craniofacial skeletal structures.","Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Genet, Boston, MA 02115 USA; Harvard Univ, Brigham & Womens Hosp, Sch Med, Decis Syst Grp, Boston, MA 02115 USA; Harvard Univ, Sch Dent Med, Dept Oral Med Infect & Immun, Boston, MA 02115 USA; Inst Mol Pathol, A-1030 Vienna, Austria; Princeton Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA","Tabin, CJ (reprint author), Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Genet, Boston, MA 02115 USA.",tabin@genetics.med.harvard.edu,,"Hartmann, Christine/0000-0002-6854-8633",,,,23,291,297,12,206,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,3-Aug,2006,442,7102,,,,,563,567,,10.1038/nature04843,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,069NQ,WOS:000239455900043,16885984,No,,,11/20/17

During embryogenesis, the rhythmic production of the precursors of the vertebrae, the somites, imposes a segmented aspect to the spine, whereas the spine's regional differentiation is controlled by Hox genes(1,2). Here we show that in the paraxial mesoderm, Hoxb genes are first activated in a temporal collinear fashion in precursors located in the epiblast lateral to the primitive streak. Our data suggest that collinear activation of Hoxb genes regulates the flux of cells from the epiblast to the streak and thus directly controls the establishment of the genes' characteristic nested expression domains in the somites. This suggests that establishment of the spatial co-linearity in the embryo is directly controlled by the Hox genes themselves.","Howard Hughes Med Inst, Kansas City, MO 64110 USA; Stowers Inst Med Res, Kansas City, MO 64110 USA","Pourquie, O (reprint author), Howard Hughes Med Inst, 1000 E 50th St, Kansas City, MO 64110 USA.",olp@stowers-institute.org,,"Pourquie, Olivier/0000-0001-5189-1227; Iimura, Tadahiro/0000-0002-1431-0689",,,,24,108,111,0,8,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,3-Aug,2006,442,7102,,,,,568,571,,10.1038/nature04838,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,069NQ,WOS:000239455900044,16760928,No,,,11/20/17

Many visually responsive neurons in the inferotemporal cortex of macaque monkeys respond selectively to faces(1-4), sometimes to only one or a few individuals(5-7), while showing little sensitivity to scale and other details of the retinal image(8,9). Here we show that face-responsive neurons in the macaque monkey anterior inferotemporal cortex are tuned to a fundamental dimension of face perception. Using a norm-based caricaturization framework previously developed for human psychophysics(10-12), we varied the identity information present in photo-realistic human faces(13), and found that neurons of the anterior inferotemporal cortex were most often tuned around the average, identity-ambiguous face. These observations are consistent with face-selective responses in this area being shaped by a figural comparison, reflecting structural differences between an incoming face and an internal reference or norm. As such, these findings link the tuning of neurons in the inferotemporal cortex to psychological models of face identity perception.","Max Planck Inst Biol Cybernet, D-72076 Tubingen, Germany; Univ Clin Tubingen, Hertie Inst Clin Brain Res, Dept Cognit Neurol, Lab Act Representat & Learning, D-72072 Tubingen, Germany","Leopold, DA (reprint author), NIMH, Unit Cognit Neurophysiol & Imaging, Neuropsychol Lab, NIH, 49 Convent Dr,Bldg 49,MSC 4400, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA.",leopoldd@mail.nih.gov,,"Leopold, David/0000-0002-1345-6360",,,,26,197,197,1,16,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,3-Aug,2006,442,7102,,,,,572,575,,10.1038/nature04951,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,069NQ,WOS:000239455900045,16862123,No,,,11/20/17

Merlin is activated by dephosphorylation at serine 518 (S518), which occurs on serum withdrawal or on cell - cell or cell - matrix contact(5,6). However, the relevant phosphatase that activates merlin's tumour suppressor function is unknown. Here we identify this enzyme as the myosin phosphatase (MYPT-1-PP1 delta). The cellular MYPT-1-PP1 delta - specific inhibitor CPI-17 causes a loss of merlin function characterized by merlin phosphorylation, Ras activation and transformation. Constitutively active merlin (S518A) reverses CPI-17-induced transformation, showing that merlin is the decisive substrate of MYPT-1-PP1 delta in tumour suppression. In addition we show that CPI-17 levels are raised in several human tumour cell lines and that the downregulation of CPI-17 induces merlin dephosphorylation, inhibits Ras activation and abolishes the transformed phenotype. MYPT-1-PP1 delta and its substrate merlin are part of a previously undescribed tumour suppressor cascade that can be hindered in two ways, by mutation of the NF2 gene and by upregulation of the oncoprotein CPI-17.","Fritz Lipmann Inst, Liebniz Inst Age Res, D-07745 Jena, Germany; Forschungszentrum Karlsruhe, Inst Toxicol & Genet, D-76021 Karlsruhe, Germany","Morrison, H (reprint author), Fritz Lipmann Inst, Liebniz Inst Age Res, Beutenbergstr 11, D-07745 Jena, Germany.",helen@fli-leibniz.de,"Jin, Hongchuan/C-3686-2009; Morrison, Helen/B-3984-2017; Sperka, Tobias/E-2659-2017","Morrison, Helen/0000-0003-4938-1409; Jin, Hongchuan/0000-0002-6697-3097",,,,28,108,110,0,9,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,3-Aug,2006,442,7102,,,,,576,579,,10.1038/nature04856,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,069NQ,WOS:000239455900046,16885985,No,,,11/20/17

This fundamental property relies on intercellular adhesion through the formation of adherens junctions containing E-cadherin molecules(1,2). Localization of E-cadherin is stabilized through a pathway involving the recruitment of actin filaments by E-cadherin(3-6). Here we identify an additional pathway that organizes actin filaments in the apical junctional region (AJR) where adherens junctions form in embryonic epithelia. This pathway is controlled by Bitesize (Btsz), a synaptotagmin-like protein(7,8) that is recruited in the AJR independently of E-cadherin and is required for epithelial stability in Drosophila embryos. On loss of btsz, E-cadherin is recruited normally to the AJR, but is not stabilized properly and actin filaments fail to form a stable continuous network. In the absence of E-cadherin, actin filaments are stable for a longer time than they are in btsz mutants. We identify two polarized cues that localize Btsz: phosphatidylinositol (4,5)-bisphosphate, to which Btsz binds; and Par-3. We show that Btsz binds to the Ezrin - Radixin - Moesin protein Moesin, an F-actin-binding protein that is localized apically(9) and is recruited in the AJR in a btsz-dependent manner. Expression of a dominant-negative form of Ezrin that does not bind F-actin phenocopies the loss of btsz. Thus, our data indicate that, through their interaction, Btsz and Moesin may mediate the proper organization of actin in a local domain, which in turn stabilizes E-cadherin. These results provide a mechanism for the spatial order of actin organization underlying junction stabilization in primary embryonic epithelia.","Univ Mediterrannee, CNRS, UMR 6216, Inst Biol Dev Marseille Luminy, F-13288 Marseille 09, France","Lecuit, T (reprint author), Univ Mediterrannee, CNRS, UMR 6216, Inst Biol Dev Marseille Luminy, Campus Luminy,Case 907, F-13288 Marseille 09, France.",lecuit@ibdm.univ-mrs.fr,,,,,,30,84,85,1,6,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,3-Aug,2006,442,7102,,,,,580,584,,10.1038/nature04935,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,069NQ,WOS:000239455900047,16862128,No,,,11/20/17

Moreover, the phenotypic and pathological consequences of protein aggregation depend critically on the specific misfolded form(1,2). A striking example of this is the prion strain phenomenon, in which prion particles composed of the same protein cause distinct heritable states(3). Accumulating evidence from yeast prions such as [PSI+] and mammalian prions argues that differences in the prion conformation underlie prion strain variants(3-7). Nonetheless, it remains poorly understood why changes in the conformation of misfolded proteins alter their physiological effects. Here we present and experimentally validate an analytical model describing how [PSI+] strain phenotypes arise from the dynamic interaction among the effects of prion dilution, competition for a limited pool of soluble protein, and conformation-dependent differences in prion growth and division rates. Analysis of three distinct prion conformations of yeast Sup35 ( the [PSI+] protein determinant) and their in vivo phenotypes reveals that the Sup35 amyloid causing the strongest phenotype surprisingly shows the slowest growth. This slow growth, however, is more than compensated for by an increased brittleness that promotes prion division. The propensity of aggregates to undergo breakage, thereby generating new seeds, probably represents a key determinant of their physiological impact for both infectious ( prion) and non-infectious amyloids.","Univ Calif San Francisco, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Dept Mol & Cellular Pharmacol, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; Calif Inst Quantitat Biomed Res, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; Japan Sci & Technol Agcy, PRESTO, Kawaguchi, Saitama 3320012, Japan","Weissman, JS (reprint author), Univ Calif San Francisco, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Dept Mol & Cellular Pharmacol, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA.",weissman@cmp.ucsf.edu,"; Tanaka, Motomasa/N-5064-2015","Collins, Sean/0000-0002-4276-5840; Tanaka, Motomasa/0000-0002-2994-7703",,,,30,374,377,4,46,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,3-Aug,2006,442,7102,,,,,585,589,,10.1038/nature04922,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,069NQ,WOS:000239455900048,16810177,No,,,11/20/17

The mechanism of homologous recombination involves the search for homology and invasion of the ends of a broken DNA molecule into homologous duplex DNA to form a cross-stranded structure, a Holliday junction (HJ)(4-7). A HJ is able to undergo branch migration along DNA, generating increasing or decreasing lengths of heteroduplex. In both prokaryotes and eukaryotes, the physical evidence for HJs, the key intermediate in homologous recombination, was provided by electron microscopy(8). In bacteria there are specialized enzymes that promote branch migration of HJs(7). However, in eukaryotes the identity of homologous recombination branch-migration protein(s) has remained elusive. Here we show that Rad54, a Swi2/Snf2 protein(9), binds HJ-like structures with high specificity and promotes their bidirectional branch migration in an ATPase-dependent manner. The activity seemed to be conserved in human and yeast Rad54 orthologues. In vitro, Rad54 has been shown to stimulate DNA pairing of Rad51, a key homologous recombination protein(10-12). However, genetic data indicate that Rad54 protein might also act at later stages of homologous recombination, after Rad51 (ref. 13). Novel DNA branch-migration activity is fully consistent with this late homologous recombination function of Rad54 protein.","Drexel Univ, Coll Med, Dept Biochem & Mol Biol, Philadelphia, PA 19102 USA; Russian Acad Sci, Inst Chem Biol & Fundamental Med, Siberian Branch, Novosibirsk 630090, Russia","Mazin, AV (reprint author), Drexel Univ, Coll Med, Dept Biochem & Mol Biol, Philadelphia, PA 19102 USA.",amazin@drexelmed.edu,,,,,,30,115,118,0,8,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,3-Aug,2006,442,7102,,,,,590,593,,10.1038/nature04889,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,069NQ,WOS:000239455900049,16862129,No,,,11/20/17

In the interstellar medium, it has been thought to be mostly molecular (N-2)(1). However, N-2 has no observable rotational or vibrational transitions, so its abundance in the interstellar medium remains poorly known. In comets, the N-2 abundance is very low(2,3), while the elemental nitrogen abundance is deficient with respect to the solar value. Moreover, large nitrogen isotopic anomalies are observed in meteorites and interstellar dust particles(4). Here we report the N2H+ (and by inference the N-2) abundance inside a cold dark molecular cloud. We find that only a small fraction of nitrogen in the gas phase is molecular, with most of it being atomic. Because the compositions of comets probably reflect those of dark clouds(5), this result explains the low N-2 abundance in comets. We argue that the elemental nitrogen abundance deficiency in comets can be understood if the atomic oxygen abundance is lower than predicted by present chemical models. Furthermore, the lack of molecular nitrogen in molecular clouds explains the nitrogen anomalies in meteorites and interstellar dust particles, as nitrogen fractionation is enhanced if gaseous nitrogen is atomic(6).","Univ Michigan, Dept Astron, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; Harvard Smithsonian Ctr Astrophys, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA","Maret, S (reprint author), Univ Michigan, Dept Astron, 500 Church St, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",smaret@umich.edu,,"Maret, Sebastien/0000-0003-1104-4554",,,,25,68,68,0,5,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,27-Jul,2006,442,7101,,,,,425,427,,10.1038/nature04919,,3,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,067CI,WOS:000239278900036,16871211,No,,,11/20/17

Recent efforts in understanding Titan's methane hydrological cycle have focused on occasional cloud outbursts near the south pole(2-4) or cloud streaks at southern mid-latitudes(5,6) and the mechanisms of their formation. It is not known, however, if the clouds produce rain or if there are also non-convective clouds, as predicted by several models(7-11). Here we show that the in situ data on the methane concentration and temperature profile in Titan's troposphere point to the presence of layered optically thin stratiform clouds. The data indicate an upper methane ice cloud and a lower, barely visible, liquid methane-nitrogen cloud, with a gap in between. The lower, liquid, cloud produces drizzle that reaches the surface. These non-convective methane clouds are quasi-permanent features supported by the global atmospheric circulation, indicating that methane precipitation occurs wherever there is slow upward motion. This drizzle is a persistent component of Titan's methane hydrological cycle and, by wetting the surface on a global scale, plays an active role in the surface geology of Titan.","Univ Cologne, Inst Geophys & Meteorol, D-50923 Cologne, Germany; NASA, Ames Res Ctr, Moffett Field, CA 94035 USA; Univ Michigan, Dept Atmospher Ocean & Space Sci, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; Univ Padua, CISAS G Colombo, I-35131 Padua, Italy; Observ Paris, LESIA, F-92195 Meudon, France; Univ Paris 07, UFR Phys, F-75006 Paris, France; NASA, Goddard Space Flight Ctr, Greenbelt, MD 20742 USA","Tokano, T (reprint author), Univ Cologne, Inst Geophys & Meteorol, Albertus Magnus Pl, D-50923 Cologne, Germany.",tokano@geo.uni-koeln.de,,,,,,30,113,113,0,10,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,27-Jul,2006,442,7101,,,,,432,435,,10.1038/nature04948,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,067CI,WOS:000239278900038,16871213,No,,,11/20/17

A major hurdle for realistic applications of Ga1-xMnxAs, or other dilute magnetic semiconductors, remains that their ferromagnetic transition temperature is below room temperature. Enhancing ferromagnetism in semiconductors requires us to understand the mechanisms for interaction between magnetic dopants, such as Mn, and identify the circumstances in which ferromagnetic interactions are maximized(5). Here we describe an atom-by-atom substitution technique using a scanning tunnelling microscope (STM) and apply it to perform a controlled study at the atomic scale of the interactions between isolated Mn acceptors, which are mediated by holes in GaAs. High-resolution STM measurements are used to visualize the GaAs electronic states that participate in the Mn - Mn interaction and to quantify the interaction strengths as a function of relative position and orientation. Our experimental findings, which can be explained using tight-binding model calculations, reveal a strong dependence of ferromagnetic interaction on crystallographic orientation. This anisotropic interaction can potentially be exploited by growing oriented Ga1-xMnxAs structures to enhance the ferromagnetic transition temperature beyond that achieved in randomly doped samples.","Princeton Univ, Joseph Henry Labs, Dept Phys, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; Univ Illinois, Dept Phys, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; Univ Iowa, Opt Sci & Technol Ctr, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA; Univ Iowa, Dept Phys & Astron, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA","Yazdani, A (reprint author), Princeton Univ, Joseph Henry Labs, Dept Phys, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA.",yazdani@princeton.edu,"Schaff, William/B-5839-2009; Tang, Jian-Ming/B-5534-2011","Tang, Jian-Ming/0000-0001-9033-0350",,,,28,200,202,5,65,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,27-Jul,2006,442,7101,,,,,436,439,,10.1038/nature04971,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,067CI,WOS:000239278900039,16871214,No,,,11/20/17

They form at mid-ocean ridges through slip on detachment faults rooted below the spreading axis(2-6). To date, most studies of core complexes have been based on isolated inactive massifs that have spread away from ridge axes. Here we present a survey of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge near 13 degrees N containing a segment in which a number of linked detachment faults extend for 75 km along one flank of the spreading axis. The detachment faults are apparently all currently active and at various stages of development. A field of extinct core complexes extends away from the axis for at least 100 km. Our observations reveal the topographic characteristics of actively forming core complexes and their evolution from initiation within the axial valley floor to maturity and eventual inactivity. Within the surrounding region there is a strong correlation between detachment fault morphology at the ridge axis and high rates of hydroacoustically recorded earthquake seismicity. Preliminary examination of seismicity and seafloor morphology farther north along the Mid-Atlantic Ridge suggests that active detachment faulting is occurring in many segments and that detachment faulting is more important in the generation of ocean crust at this slow-spreading ridge than previously suspected.","Woods Hole Oceanog Inst, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA; Univ Leeds, Sch Earth Sci, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England; CNRS, Marine Geosci Grp, F-75252 Paris, France","Smith, DK (reprint author), Woods Hole Oceanog Inst, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA.",dsmith@whoi.edu,"Escartin, Javier/B-3344-2008; ESCARTIN, Javier/A-1043-2010; ipgp, Laboratoire geoscien/F-8471-2010","ESCARTIN, Javier/0000-0002-3416-6856; ",,,,26,131,139,0,19,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,27-Jul,2006,442,7101,,,,,440,443,,10.1038/nature04950,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,067CI,WOS:000239278900040,16871215,No,,,11/20/17

As hot, acidic and reduced hydrothermal fluids mix with cold, alkaline and oxygenated sea water, minerals precipitate to formporous sulphide - sulphate deposits. These structures provide microhabitats for a diversity of prokaryotes that exploit the geochemical and physical gradients in this dynamic ecosystem(1). It has been proposed that fluid pH in the actively venting sulphide structures is generally low( pH < 4.5)(2), yet no extreme thermoacidophile has been isolated from vent deposits. Culture-independent surveys based on ribosomal RNA genes from deep-sea hydrothermal deposits have identified a widespread euryarchaeotal lineage, DHVE2 (deep-sea hydrothermal vent euryarchaeotic 2)(3-6). Despite the ubiquity and apparent deep-sea endemism of DHVE2, cultivation of this group has been unsuccessful and thus its metabolism remains a mystery. Here we report the isolation and cultivation of a member of the DHVE2 group, which is an obligate thermoacidophilic sulphur- or iron-reducing heterotroph capable of growing from pH 3.3 to 5.8 and between 55 and 75 degrees C.

Influenza prevention and containment strategies can be considered under the broad categories of antiviral, vaccine and non-pharmaceutical ( case isolation, household quarantine, school or workplace closure, restrictions on travel) measures(1). Mathematical models are powerful tools for exploring this complex landscape of intervention strategies and quantifying the potential costs and benefits of different options(2-5). Here we use a large-scale epidemic simulation(6) to examine intervention options should initial containment(6,7) of a novel influenza outbreak fail, using Great Britain and the United States as examples. We find that border restrictions and/or internal travel restrictions are unlikely to delay spread by more than 2 - 3 weeks unless more than 99% effective. School closure during the peak of a pandemic can reduce peak attack rates by up to 40%, but has little impact on overall attack rates, whereas case isolation or household quarantine could have a significant impact, if feasible. Treatment of clinical cases can reduce transmission, but only if antivirals are given within a day of symptoms starting. Given enough drugs for 50% of the population, household-based prophylaxis coupled with reactive school closure could reduce clinical attack rates by 40 - 50%. More widespread prophylaxis would be even more logistically challenging but might reduce attack rates by over 75%. Vaccine stockpiled in advance of a pandemic could significantly reduce attack rates even if of low efficacy. Estimates of policy effectiveness will change if the characteristics of a future pandemic strain differ substantially from those seen in past pandemics.","Imperial Coll London, Fac Med, Dept Infect Dis Epidemiol, London W2 1PG, England; Johns Hopkins Bloomberg Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Int Hlth, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA; RTI Int Inc, Res Triangle Pk, NC 27709 USA","Ferguson, NM (reprint author), Imperial Coll London, Fac Med, Dept Infect Dis Epidemiol, St Marys Campus,Norfolk Pl, London W2 1PG, England.",neil.ferguson@imperial.ac.uk,"Fraser, Christophe/A-8109-2008; Ferguson, Neil/B-8578-2008","Fraser, Christophe/0000-0003-2399-9657; Ferguson, Neil/0000-0002-1154-8093; /0000-0002-5704-8094",,,,23,953,984,18,160,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,27-Jul,2006,442,7101,,,,,448,452,,10.1038/nature04795,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,067CI,WOS:000239278900042,16642006,No,,,11/20/17

Morphogenesis of seamless, properly patterned endothelial tubes is essential for the development of a functional vertebrate circulatory system, but the mechanism of vascular lumenization in vivo remains unclear. Evidence dating back more than 100 years has hinted at an important function for endothelial vacuoles in lumen formation(2). More than 25 years ago, in some of the first endothelial cell culture experiments in vitro, Folkman and Haudenschild described ""longitudinal vacuoles"" that ""appeared to be extruded and connected from one cell to the next""(3,4), observations confirmed and extended by later studies in vitro showing that intracellular vacuoles arise from integrin-dependent and cdc42/Rac1-dependent pinocytic events downstream of integrin - extracellular-matrix signalling interactions(5-10). Despite compelling data supporting a model for the assembly of endothelial tubes in vitro through the formation and fusion of vacuoles, conclusive evidence in vivo has been lacking, primarily because of difficulties associated with imaging the dynamics of subcellular endothelial vacuoles deep within living animals. Here we use high-resolution time-lapse two-photon imaging of transgenic zebrafish to examine how endothelial tubes assemble in vivo, comparing our results with time-lapse imaging of human endothelial-cell tube formation in three-dimensional collagen matrices in vitro.

In every species studied, disruption of an epithelial layer instantaneously generates endogenous electric fields, which have been proposed to be important in wound healing(1-3). The identity of signalling pathways that guide both cell migration to electric cues and electric-field-induced wound healing have not been elucidated at a genetic level. Here we show that electric fields, of a strength equal to those detected endogenously, direct cell migration during wound healing as a prime directional cue. Manipulation of endogenous wound electric fields affects wound healing in vivo. Electric stimulation triggers activation of Src and inositol - phospholipid signalling, which polarizes in the direction of cell migration. Notably, genetic disruption of phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase-gamma (PI( 3) K gamma) decreases electric-field-induced signalling and abolishes directed movements of healing epithelium in response to electric signals. Deletion of the tumour suppressor phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) enhances signalling and electrotactic responses. These data identify genes essential for electrical-signal-induced wound healing and show that PI(3) K gamma and PTEN control electrotaxis.","Univ Aberdeen, Sch Med Sci, Aberdeen AB25 2ZD, Scotland; Univ Aberdeen, Dept Ophthalmol, Aberdeen AB25 2ZD, Scotland; Austrian Acad Sci, Inst Mol Biotechnol, A-1030 Vienna, Austria; Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Mol & Cellular Pharmacol, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; Akita Univ, Sch Med, Dept Pathol & Immunol, Akita 0108543, Japan; Akita Univ, Sch Med, Dept Mol Biol, Akita 0108543, Japan; Johns Hopkins Univ, Sch Med, Dept Cell Biol, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA","Zhao, M (reprint author), Univ Aberdeen, Sch Med Sci, Aberdeen AB25 2ZD, Scotland.",m.zhao@abdn.ac.uk; josef.penninger@imba.oeaw.ac.at,"McCaig, Colin/B-1774-2010; Wang, Fei/A-7968-2013; Penninger, Josef/I-6860-2013","Penninger, Josef/0000-0002-8194-3777",NIGMS NIH HHS [R01 GM028007]; Wellcome Trust,,,30,403,430,11,94,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,27-Jul,2006,442,7101,,,,,457,460,,10.1038/nature04925,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,067CI,WOS:000239278900044,16871217,No,,,11/20/17

Infiltration of innate immune cells, elevated activities of matrix metalloproteases and increased angiogenesis and vasculature density are a few examples of the similarities between chronic and tumour-associated inflammation(2). Conversely, the elimination of early malignant lesions by immune surveillance, which relies on the cytotoxic activity of tumour-infiltrating T cells or intra-epithelial lymphocytes, is thought to be rate-limiting for the risk to develop cancer(3). Here we show a molecular connection between the rise in tumour-associated inflammation and a lack of tumour immune surveillance. Expression of the heterodimeric cytokine interleukin (IL)-23, but not of its close relative IL-12, is increased in human tumours. Expression of these cytokines antagonistically regulates local inflammatory responses in the tumour microenvironment and infiltration of intra-epithelial lymphocytes. Whereas IL-12 promotes infiltration of cytotoxic T cells, IL-23 promotes inflammatory responses such as upregulation of the matrix metalloprotease MMP9, and increases angiogenesis but reduces CD8 T-cell infiltration. Genetic deletion or antibody-mediated elimination of IL-23 leads to increased infiltration of cytotoxic T cells into the transformed tissue, rendering a protective effect against chemically induced carcinogenesis. Finally, transplanted tumours are growth-restricted in hosts depleted for IL-23 or in IL-23-receptor-deficient mice. Although many strategies for immune therapy of cancer attempt to stimulate an immune response against solid tumours, infiltration of effector cells into the tumour tissue often appears to be a critical hurdle(4-7). We show that IL-23 is an important molecular link between tumour-promoting pro-inflammatory processes and the failure of the adaptive immune surveillance to infiltrate tumours.","Schering Plough BioPharma, Palo Alto, CA 94304 USA","Oft, M (reprint author), Schering Plough BioPharma, 901 Calif Ave, Palo Alto, CA 94304 USA.",martin.oft@spcorp.com,,,,,,30,575,616,1,35,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,27-Jul,2006,442,7101,,,,,461,465,,10.1038/nature04808,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,067CI,WOS:000239278900045,16688182,No,,,11/20/17

ATM activates cell-cycle checkpoints and can induce apoptosis in response to DNA DSBs(1-4). However, defects in these pathways of the DNA damage response cannot fully account for the phenotypes of ATM deficiency. Here, we show that ATM also functions directly in the repair of chromosomal DNA DSBs by maintaining DNA ends in repair complexes generated during lymphocyte antigen receptor gene assembly.

The anaphase promoting complex/cyclosome and its activator Cdh1 (APC/C-Cdh1) restrains axonal growth but the targets of APC/C-Cdh1 in neurons are unknown(3-5). Id2 and other members of the Id family are very unstable proteins that are eliminated as cells enter the quiescent state, but how they are targeted for degradation has remained elusive(6,7). Here we show that Id2 interacts with the core subunits of APC/C and Cdh1 in primary neurons. APC/C-Cdh1 targets Id2 for degradation through a destruction box motif ( D box) that is conserved in Id1 and Id4. Depletion of Cdh1 stabilizes Id proteins in neurons, whereas Id2 D-box mutants are impaired for Cdh1 binding and remain stable in cells that exit from the cell cycle and contain active APC/C-Cdh1. Mutants of the Id2 D box enhance axonal growth in cerebellar granule neurons in vitro and in the context of the cerebellar cortex, and overcome the myelin inhibitory signals for growth. Conversely, activation of bHLH transcription factors induces a cluster of genes with potent axonal inhibitory functions including the gene coding for the Nogo receptor, a key transducer of myelin inhibition. Degradation of Id2 in neurons permits the accumulation of the Nogo receptor, thereby linking APC/C-Cdh1 activity with bHLH target genes for the inhibition of axonal growth. These findings indicate that deregulated Id activity might be useful to reprogramme quiescent neurons into the axonal growth mode.","Columbia Univ, Coll Phys & Surg, Inst Canc Genet, New York, NY 10032 USA; Columbia Univ, Coll Phys & Surg, Dept Pathol, New York, NY 10032 USA; Columbia Univ, Coll Phys & Surg, Dept Pediat, New York, NY 10032 USA; Columbia Univ, Coll Phys & Surg, Dept Neurol, New York, NY 10032 USA; Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Pathol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; NYU, Sch Med, NYU Canc Inst, Dept Pathol, New York, NY 10016 USA","Iavarone, A (reprint author), Columbia Univ, Coll Phys & Surg, Inst Canc Genet, New York, NY 10032 USA.",ai2102@columbia.edu,,"pagano, michele/0000-0003-3210-2442",,,,26,175,186,1,8,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,27-Jul,2006,442,7101,,,,,471,474,,10.1038/nature04895,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,067CI,WOS:000239278900047,16810178,No,,,11/20/17

Microtubule doublets are structural components of axonemes that contain a number of proteins besides tubulin, and are usually found in arrays of nine doublets arranged around two singlet microtubules. Coordinated sliding of adjacent doublets, which involves a host of other proteins in the axoneme, produces periodic beating movements of the axoneme. We have obtained a three-dimensional density map of intact microtubule doublets using cryo-electron tomography and image averaging. Our map, with a resolution of about 3 nm, provides insights into locations of particular proteins within the doublets and the structural features of the doublets that define their mechanical properties. We identify likely candidates for several of these non-tubulin components of the doublets.

This structure demonstrates that only one strand of DNA passes through the hexamer channel and that the DNA-binding hairpins of each subunit form a spiral 'staircase' that sequentially tracks the oligonucleotide backbone. Consecutively grouped ATP, ADP and apo configurations correlate with the height of the hairpin, suggesting a straightforward DNA translocation mechanism. Each subunit sequentially progresses through ATP, ADP and apo states while the associated DNA-binding hairpin travels from the top staircase position to the bottom, escorting one nucleotide of single-stranded DNA through the channel.

The onset of a nova is well understood(1) as driven by runaway thermonuclear fusion reactions on the surface of a white dwarf in a binary star system; but the structure, dynamics and mass of the ejecta are not well known. In rare cases, the white dwarf is embedded in the wind nebula of a red-giant companion, and the explosion products plough through the nebula and produce X-ray emission. Here we report X-ray observations of such an event, from the eruption of the recurrent nova RS Ophiuchi(2,3). The hard X-ray emission from RS Ophiuchi early in the eruption emanates from behind a blast wave, or outward-moving shock wave, that expanded freely for less than 2 days and then decelerated owing to interaction with the nebula. The X-rays faded rapidly, suggesting that the blast wave deviates from the standard spherical shell structure(4-6). The early onset of deceleration indicates that the ejected shell had a low mass, the white dwarf has a high mass(7), and that RS Ophiuchi is therefore a progenitor of the type of supernova ( type Ia) integral to studies of the expansion of the Universe.","Smithsonian Astrophys Observ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; Univ Sao Paulo, Inst Astron Geofis & Ciencias Atmosfer, BR-05508900 Sao Paulo, Brazil; Univ Space Res Assoc, Greenbelt, MD 20771 USA; NASA, Goddard Space Flight Ctr, Greenbelt, MD 20771 USA","Sokoloski, JL (reprint author), Smithsonian Astrophys Observ, 60 Garden St, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",jsokoloski@cfa.harvard.edu,,"Kenyon, Scott/0000-0003-0214-609X",,,,30,131,132,0,14,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,20-Jul,2006,442,7100,,,,,276,278,,10.1038/nature04893,,3,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,064WT,WOS:000239122100032,16855584,No,,,11/20/17

Although the cause of these outbursts is known to be thermonuclear explosion of matter transferred from the companion onto the surface of the white dwarf(3), models of the previous ( 1985) outburst of RS Ophiuchi failed to adequately fit the X-ray evolution(4) and there was controversy over a single-epoch high-resolution radio image, which suggested that the remnant was bipolar(5,6) rather than spherical as modelled. Here we report the detection of spatially resolved structure in RS Ophiuchi from two weeks after its 12 February 2006 outburst. We track an expanding shock wave as it sweeps through the red giant wind, producing a remnant similar to that of a type II supernova but evolving over months rather than millennia(7). As in supernova remnants, the radio emission is non-thermal ( synchrotron emission), but asymmetries and multiple emission components clearly demonstrate that contrary to the assumptions of spherical symmetry in models of the 1985 explosion, the ejection is jet-like, collimated by the central binary whose orientation on the sky can be determined from these observations.","Univ Manchester, Jodrell Bank Observ, Sch Phys & Astron, Macclesfield SK11 9DL, Cheshire, England; Liverpool John Moores Univ, Astrophys Res Inst, Birkenhead CH41 1LD, Merseyside, England; Max Planck Inst Radioastron, D-53121 Bonn, Germany; Univ Cent Lancashire, Ctr Astrophys, Preston PR1 2HE, Lancs, England; Keele Univ, Sch Phys & Geog Sci, Astrophys Grp, Keele ST5 5BG, Staffs, England","O'Brien, TJ (reprint author), Univ Manchester, Jodrell Bank Observ, Sch Phys & Astron, Macclesfield SK11 9DL, Cheshire, England.",tim.obrien@manchester.ac.uk,,"Muxlow, Thomas/0000-0001-5797-8796",,,,28,107,107,0,3,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,20-Jul,2006,442,7100,,,,,279,281,,10.1038/nature04949,,3,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,064WT,WOS:000239122100033,16855585,No,,,11/20/17

One possible route to harnessing these properties for applications would be to incorporate graphene sheets in a composite material. The manufacturing of such composites requires not only that graphene sheets be produced on a sufficient scale but that they also be incorporated, and homogeneously distributed, into various matrices. Graphite, inexpensive and available in large quantity, unfortunately does not readily exfoliate to yield individual graphene sheets. Here we present a general approach for the preparation of graphene-polymer composites via complete exfoliation of graphite(9) and molecular-level dispersion of individual, chemically modified graphene sheets within polymer hosts. A polystyrene - graphene composite formed by this route exhibits a percolation threshold(10) of similar to 0.1 volume per cent for room-temperature electrical conductivity, the lowest reported value for any carbon-based composite except for those involving carbon nanotubes(11); at only 1 volume per cent, this composite has a conductivity of similar to 0.1 S m(-1), sufficient for many electrical applications(12).

Upper-crustal magma chambers have been imaged beneath fast- and intermediate-spreading centres(1-4) but it has been difficult to image structures beneath these magma sills. Using three-dimensional seismic reflection images, here we report the presence of Moho reflections beneath a crustal magma chamber at the 9 degrees 03' N overlapping spreading centre, East Pacific Rise. Our observations highlight the formation of the Moho at zero-aged crust. Over a distance of less than 7 km along the ridge crest, a rapid increase in two-way travel time of seismic waves between the magma chamber and Moho reflections is observed, which we suggest is due to a melt anomaly in the lower crust. The amplitude versus offset variation of reflections from the magma chamber shows a coincident region of higher melt fraction overlying this anomalous region, supporting the conclusion of additional melt at depth.","IPG Paris, Lab Geosci Marine, F-75252 Paris 05, France; Univ Cambridge, Bullard Labs, Cambridge CB3 0EZ, England; Univ Calif San Diego, Cecil H & Ida M Green Inst Geophys & Planetary Ph, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; Univ Southampton, Sch Ocean & Earth Sci, Southampton SO14 3ZH, Hants, England; Univ Durham, Dept Earth Sci, Durham DH1 3LE, England","Singh, SC (reprint author), IPG Paris, Lab Geosci Marine, F-75252 Paris 05, France.",singh@ipgp.jussieu.fr,"Hobbs, Richard/F-1054-2013; ipgp, Laboratoire geoscien/F-8471-2010; Bazin, Sara/A-5654-2011; White, Robert/B-8453-2015","Hobbs, Richard/0000-0001-5131-9239; ",,,,30,45,45,0,15,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,20-Jul,2006,442,7100,,,,,287,290,,10.1038/nature04939,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,064WT,WOS:000239122100035,16855587,No,,,11/20/17

On the other hand, continental rifts are segmented by large offset normal faults, and many lack magmatism. It is unclear how, when and where the ubiquitous segmented melt zones are emplaced during the continental rupture process. Between 14 September and 4 October 2005, 163 earthquakes (magnitudes greater than 3.9) and a volcanic eruption occurred within the similar to 60-km-long Dabbahu magmatic segment of the Afar rift, a nascent seafloor spreading centre in stretched continental lithosphere(3,4). Here we present a three-dimensional deformation field for the Dabbahu rifting episode derived from satellite radar data, which shows that the entire segment ruptured, making it the largest to have occurred on land in the era of satellite geodesy. Simple elastic modelling shows that the magmatic segment opened by up to 8 m, yet seismic rupture can account for only 8 per cent of the observed deformation. Magma was injected along a dyke between depths of 2 and 9 km, corresponding to a total intrusion volume of similar to 2.5 km(3). Much of the magma appears to have originated from shallow chambers beneath Dabbahu and Gabho volcanoes at the northern end of the segment, where an explosive fissural eruption occurred on 26 September 2005. Although comparable in magnitude to the ten year ( 1975 - 84) Krafla events in Iceland(5), seismic data suggest that most of the Dabbahu dyke intrusion occurred in less than a week. Thus, magma intrusion via dyking, rather than segmented normal faulting, maintains and probably initiated the along-axis segmentation along this sector of the Nubia-Arabia plate boundary.","Univ Oxford, Dept Earth Sci, Oxford OX1 3PR, England; Univ London, Royal Holloway & Bedford New Coll, Dept Geol, Egham TW20 0EX, Surrey, England; Univ Addis Ababa, Geophys Observ, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia; Univ Addis Ababa, Dept Earth Sci, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia","Wright, TJ (reprint author), Univ Leeds, Sch Earth & Environm, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England.",t.wright@see.leeds.ac.uk,"Biggs, Juliet/D-4599-2011; Wright, Tim/A-5892-2011; NCEO, COMET+`/A-3443-2013","Wright, Tim/0000-0001-8338-5935; Biggs, Juliet/0000-0002-4855-039X; Keir, Derek/0000-0001-8787-8446",,,,27,281,283,2,54,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,20-Jul,2006,442,7100,,,,,291,294,,10.1038/nature04978,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,064WT,WOS:000239122100036,16855588,No,,,11/20/17

Plants carrying mutations in the mop1 gene also stochastically exhibit pleiotropic developmental phenotypes(3).

Nuclear run-on assays reveal that the tandem repeats required for b1 paramutation are transcribed from both strands, but siRNAs were not detected.

Furthermore, KLF2 both binds and transactivates the promoter for S1P(1) - a receptor that is critical for thymocyte egress and recirculation through peripheral lymphoid organs.

The duration of the active state is limited by GTPase-activating proteins ( GAPs), which accelerate the slow intrinsic rate of GTP hydrolysis. Proteins containing TBC (Tre-2, Bub2 and Cdc16) domains are broadly conserved in eukaryotic organisms and function as GAPs for Rab GTPases as well as GTPases that control cytokinesis(2). An exposed arginine residue is a critical determinant of GAP activity in vitro and in vivo(3-5). It has been expected that the catalytic mechanism of TBC domains would parallel that of Ras and Rho family GAPs. Here we report crystallographic, mutational and functional analyses of complexes between Rab GTPases and the TBC domain of Gyp1p. In the crystal structure of a TBC-domain-Rab-GTPase-aluminium fluoride complex, which approximates the transition-state intermediate for GTP hydrolysis, the TBC domain supplies two catalytic residues in trans, an arginine finger analogous to Ras/Rho family GAPs and a glutamine finger that substitutes for the glutamine in the DxxGQ motif of the GTPase.

Tri- and dimethylation of lysine 9 on histone H3 (H3K9me3/me2) is required for the binding of the repressive protein HP1 and is associated with heterochromatin formation and transcriptional repression in a variety of species(4-6). H3K9me3 has long been regarded as a 'permanent' epigenetic mark(7,8). In a search for proteins and complexes interacting with H3K9me3, we identified the protein GASC1 ( gene amplified in squamous cell carcinoma 1)(9), which belongs to the JMJD2 ( jumonji domain containing 2) subfamily of the jumonji family, and is also known as JMJD2C(10). Here we show that three members of this subfamily of proteins demethylate H3K9me3/me2 in vitro through a hydroxylation reaction requiring iron and alpha-ketoglutarate as cofactors. Furthermore, we demonstrate that ectopic expression of GASC1 or other JMJD2 members markedly decreases H3K9me3/me2 levels, increases H3K9me1 levels, delocalizes HP1 and reduces heterochromatin in vivo. Previously, GASC1 was found to be amplified in several cell lines derived from oesophageal squamous carcinomas(9,11,12), and in agreement with a contribution of GASC1 to tumour development, inhibition of GASC1 expression decreases cell proliferation. Thus, in addition to identifying GASC1 as a histone trimethyl demethylase, we suggest a model for how this enzyme might be involved in cancer development, and propose it as a target for anti-cancer therapy.","Biotech Res & Innovat Ctr, DK-2100 Copenhagen, Denmark; FIRC Inst Mol Oncol, I-20139 Milan, Italy; Univ Copenhagen, Fac Hlth Sci, DK-2200 Copenhagen, Denmark","Helin, K (reprint author), Biotech Res & Innovat Ctr, Fruebjergvej 3, DK-2100 Copenhagen, Denmark.",kristian.helin@bric.dk,"Rappsilber, Juri/B-7265-2015","Rappsilber, Juri/0000-0001-5999-1310; Hansen, Klaus/0000-0001-9657-8816; Helin, Kristian/0000-0003-1975-6097",,,,30,452,469,0,24,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,20-Jul,2006,442,7100,,,,,307,311,,10.1038/nature04837,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,064WT,WOS:000239122100040,16732293,No,,,11/20/17

Recent studies indicate that methylation on specific histone lysine ( K) residues participates in many of these processes(3). Lysine methylation occurs in three distinct states, having either one (me1), two (me2) or three (me3) methyl groups attached to the amine group of the lysine side chain. These differences in modification state have an important role in defining how methylated chromatin is recognized and interpreted(4-6). Until recently, histone lysine methylation was considered a stable modification(7,8), but the identification of histone demethylase enzymes has demonstrated the reversibility of this epigenetic mark(9-11). So far, all characterized histone demethylases show enzymatic activity towards lysine residues modified in the me1 or me2 state(9-11), leaving open the possibility that me3 constitutes an irreversible modification. Here we demonstrate that JHDM3A ( jumonji C (JmjC)- domain-containing histone demethylase 3A; also known as JMJD2A) is capable of removing the me3 group from modified H3 lysine 9 (H3K9) and H3 lysine 36 (H3K36). Overexpression of JHDM3A abrogates recruitment of HP1 ( heterochromatin protein 1) to heterochromatin, indicating a role for JHDM3A in antagonizing methylated H3K9 nucleated events. siRNA-mediated knockdown of JHDM3A leads to increased levels of H3K9 methylation and upregulation of a JHDM3A target gene, ASCL2, indicating that JHDM3A may function in euchromatin to remove histone methylation marks that are associated with active transcription(12).","Univ N Carolina, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA; Univ N Carolina, Lineberger Comprehens Canc Ctr, Dept Biochem & Biophys, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA; Baylor Coll Med, Dept Mol & Cellular Biol, Houston, TX 77030 USA; Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Program Mol Biol, New York, NY 10021 USA","Zhang, Y (reprint author), Univ N Carolina, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA.",yi_zhang@med.unc.edu,,"Tempst, Paul/0000-0002-6680-3987",,,,28,385,401,1,26,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,20-Jul,2006,442,7100,,,,,312,316,,10.1038/nature04853,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,064WT,WOS:000239122100041,16732292,No,,,11/20/17

In the conventional paradigm, simple protein structures are assumed to fold in an all-or-none process(1) that is inaccessible to experiment. Existing experimental methods therefore probe folding mechanisms indirectly. A widely used approach interprets changes in protein stability(2) and/or folding kinetics(3,4), induced by engineered mutations, in terms of the structure of the native protein. In addition to limitations in connecting energetics with structure(5), mutational methods have significant experimental uncertainties(6) and are unable to map complex networks of interactions. In contrast, analytical theory predicts small barriers to folding and the possibility of downhill folding(7,8). These theoretical predictions have been confirmed experimentally in recent years(9-11), including the observation of global downhill folding(12). However, a key remaining question is whether downhill folding can indeed lead to the high-resolution analysis of protein folding processes(13). Here we show, with the use of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), that the downhill protein BBL from Escherichia coli unfolds atom by atom starting from a defined three-dimensional structure. Thermal unfolding data on 158 backbone and side-chain protons out of a total of 204 provide a detailed view of the structural events during folding. This view confirms the statistical nature of folding, and exposes the interplay between hydrogen bonding, hydrophobic forces, backbone conformation and side-chain entropy. From the data we also obtain a map of the interaction network in this protein, which reveals the source of folding cooperativity. Our approach can be extended to other proteins with marginal barriers ( less than 3RT), providing a new tool for the study of protein folding.","Univ Maryland, Dept Chem & Biochem, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; Univ Maryland, Ctr Biomol Struct & Org, College Pk, MD 20742 USA","Munoz, V (reprint author), Univ Maryland, Dept Chem & Biochem, College Pk, MD 20742 USA.",vmunoz@umd.edu,,,,,,29,177,177,1,27,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,20-Jul,2006,442,7100,,,,,317,321,,10.1038/nature04859,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,064WT,WOS:000239122100042,16799571,No,,,11/20/17

To translate preclinical results from intact animals to a clinically useful NMP, movement signals must persist in cortex after spinal cord injury and be engaged by movement intent when sensory inputs and limb movement are long absent. Furthermore, NMPs would require that intention-driven neuronal activity be converted into a control signal that enables useful tasks. Here we show initial results for a tetraplegic human (MN) using a pilot NMP. Neuronal ensemble activity recorded through a 96-microelectrode array implanted in primary motor cortex demonstrated that intended hand motion modulates cortical spiking patterns three years after spinal cord injury. Decoders were created, providing a 'neural cursor' with which MN opened simulated e-mail and operated devices such as a television, even while conversing. Furthermore, MN used neural control to open and close a prosthetic hand, and perform rudimentary actions with a multi-jointed robotic arm.

The standard theoretical interpretation attributes prompt emission to internal shocks in the ultrarelativistic outflow generated by the internal engine(3-5); early afterglow emission is attributed to shocks generated by interaction with the surrounding medium(6-8). Here we report on observations of a bright GRB that, for the first time, clearly show the temporal relationship and relative strength of the two optical components. The observations indicate that early afterglow emission can be understood as reverberation of the energy input measured by prompt emission. Measurements of the early afterglow reverberations therefore probe the structure of the environment around the burst, whereas the subsequent response to late-time impulsive energy releases reveals how earlier flaring episodes have altered the jet and environment parameters.

Among the different approaches for spin generation and manipulation, spin - orbit coupling - which couples the spin of an electron to its momentum - is attracting considerable interest. In a spin - orbit-coupled system, a non-zero spin current is predicted in a direction perpendicular to the applied electric field, giving rise to a spin Hall effect(2-4). Consistent with this effect, electrically induced spin polarization was recently detected by optical techniques at the edges of a semiconductor channel(5) and in two-dimensional electron gases in semiconductor heterostructures(6,7). Here we report electrical measurements of the spin Hall effect in a diffusive metallic conductor, using a ferromagnetic electrode in combination with a tunnel barrier to inject a spin-polarized current. In our devices, we observe an induced voltage that results exclusively from the conversion of the injected spin current into charge imbalance through the spin Hall effect. Such a voltage is proportional to the component of the injected spins that is perpendicular to the plane defined by the spin current direction and the voltage probes. These experiments reveal opportunities for efficient spin detection without the need for magnetic materials, which could lead to useful spintronics devices that integrate information processing and data storage.","Harvard Univ, Dept Phys, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA","Valenzuela, SO (reprint author), MIT, Francis Bitter Natl Magnet Lab, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",sov@mit.edu,,,,,,27,754,762,22,238,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,13-Jul,2006,442,7099,,,,,176,179,,10.1038/nature04937,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,062XJ,WOS:000238979700041,16838016,No,,,11/20/17

It determines the oxidizing power of the atmosphere, and thereby controls the removal of nearly all gaseous atmospheric pollutants(3,4). The atmospheric supply of OH is limited, however, and could be overcome by consumption due to increasing pollution and climate change(4-6), with detrimental feedback effects. To date, the high variability of OH concentrations has prevented the use of local observations to monitor possible trends in the concentration of this species. Here we present and analyse long-term measurements of atmospheric OH concentrations, which were taken between 1999 and 2003 at the Meteorological Observatory Hohenpeissenberg in southern Germany. We find that the concentration of OH can be described by a surprisingly linear dependence on solar ultraviolet radiation throughout the measurement period, despite the fact that OH concentrations are influenced by thousands of reactants. A detailed numerical model of atmospheric reactions and measured trace gas concentrations indicates that the observed correlation results from compensations between individual processes affecting OH, but that a full understanding of these interactions may not be possible on the basis of our current knowledge of atmospheric chemistry. As a consequence of the stable relationship between OH concentrations and ultraviolet radiation that we observe, we infer that there is no long-term trend in the level of OH in the Hohenpeissenberg data set.","Forschungszentrum Julich, Inst ICG Troposphare 2, D-52425 Julich, Germany; German Natl Meteorol Serv, DWD, MOHp, D-82383 Hohenpeissenberg, Germany","Rohrer, F (reprint author), Forschungszentrum Julich, Inst ICG Troposphare 2, Postfach 1913, D-52425 Julich, Germany.",f.rohrer@fz-juelich.de; harald.berresheim@dwd.de,"Berresheim, Harald/F-9670-2011; Rohrer, Franz/I-2052-2012","Rohrer, Franz/0000-0003-3436-3419; Berresheim, Harald/0000-0003-3095-0800",,,,29,141,148,9,76,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,13-Jul,2006,442,7099,,,,,184,187,,10.1038/nature04924,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,062XJ,WOS:000238979700043,16838018,No,,,11/20/17

In both locations, tremor is observed to coincide temporally with large, slow slip events on the plate interface downdip of the seismogenic zone(2-7). The relationship between tremor and aseismic slip remains uncertain, however, largely owing to difficulty in constraining the source depth of tremor. In southwest Japan, a high quality borehole seismic network allows identification of coherent S-wave ( and sometimes P-wave) arrivals within the tremor, whose sources are classified as low-frequency earthquakes. As low-frequency earthquakes comprise at least a portion of tremor, understanding their mechanism is critical to understanding tremor as a whole. Here, we provide strong evidence that these earthquakes occur on the plate interface, coincident with the inferred zone of slow slip. The locations and characteristics of these events suggest that they are generated by shear slip during otherwise aseismic transients, rather than by fluid flow. High pore-fluid pressure in the immediate vicinity, as implied by our estimates of seismic P- and S-wave speeds, may act to promote this transient mode of failure. Low-frequency earthquakes could potentially contribute to seismic hazard forecasting by providing a new means to monitor slow slip at depth.","Stanford Univ, Dept Geophys, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; Univ Tokyo, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo 1130033, Japan; Univ Tokyo, Earthquake Res Inst, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo 1130032, Japan","Shelly, DR (reprint author), Stanford Univ, Dept Geophys, 397 Panama Mall, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",dshelly@pangea.stanford.edu,"IDE, SATOSHI/G-4887-2014",,,,,30,399,406,6,70,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,13-Jul,2006,442,7099,,,,,188,191,,10.1038/nature04931,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,062XJ,WOS:000238979700044,16838019,No,,,11/20/17

In animals, Argonaute proteins segregate into two subfamilies(4). The Argonaute subfamily acts in RNA interference and in microRNA-mediated gene regulation using 21 - 22-nucleotide RNAs as guides. The Piwi subfamily is involved in germline-specific events such as germline stem cell maintenance and meiosis. However, neither the biochemical function of Piwi proteins nor the nature of their small RNA guides is known. Here we show that MIWI, a murine Piwi protein, binds a previously uncharacterized class of similar to 29-30-nucleotide RNAs that are highly abundant in testes. We have therefore named these Piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs). piRNAs show distinctive localization patterns in the genome, being predominantly grouped into 20-90-kilobase clusters, wherein long stretches of small RNAs are derived from only one strand. Similar piRNAs are also found in human and rat, with major clusters occurring in syntenic locations. Although their function must still be resolved, the abundance of piRNAs in germline cells and the male sterility of Miwi mutants suggest a role in gametogenesis.","Watson Sch Biol Sci, Cold Spring Harbor Lab, Cold Spring Harbor, NY 11724 USA; Ecole Natl Super Mines, F-75272 Paris, France","Hannon, GJ (reprint author), Watson Sch Biol Sci, Cold Spring Harbor Lab, 1 Bungtown Rd, Cold Spring Harbor, NY 11724 USA.",hannon@cshl.edu,,"sachidanandam, ravi/0000-0001-9844-4459",,,,25,782,864,2,72,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,13-Jul,2006,442,7099,,,,,199,202,,10.1038/nature04917,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,062XJ,WOS:000238979700047,16751776,No,,,11/20/17

MyoV was the first member of the myosin superfamily shown to be processive, meaning that a single motor protein can 'walk' hand-over-hand along an actin filament for many steps before detaching(2-4). Full-length myoV has a low actin-activated MgATPase activity at low [Ca2+], whereas expressed constructs lacking the cargo-binding domain have a high activity regardless of [Ca2+] (refs 5 - 7). Hydrodynamic data and electron micrographs indicate that the active state is extended, whereas the inactive state is compact(8-10). Here we show the first three-dimensional structure of the myoV inactive state. Each myoV molecule consists of two heads that contain an amino-terminal motor domain followed by a lever arm that binds six calmodulins. The heads are followed by a coiled-coil dimerization domain (S2) and a carboxy-terminal globular cargo-binding domain. In the inactive structure, bending of myoV at the head S2 junction places the cargo-binding domain near the motor domain's ATP-binding pocket, indicating that ATPase inhibition might occur through decreased rates of nucleotide exchange. The actin-binding interfaces are unobstructed, and the lever arm is oriented in a position typical of strong actin-binding states. This structure indicates that motor recycling after cargo delivery might occur through transport on actively treadmilling actin filaments rather than by diffusion.","Florida State Univ, Inst Mol Biophys, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA; Univ Vermont, Dept Mol Physiol & Biophys, Burlington, VT 05405 USA","Trybus, KM (reprint author), Florida State Univ, Inst Mol Biophys, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA.",trybus@physiology.med.uvm.edu,,,NIAMS NIH HHS [R01 AR047421],,,30,131,134,1,19,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,13-Jul,2006,442,7099,,,,,208,211,,10.1038/nature04719,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,062XJ,WOS:000238979700049,16625208,No,,,11/20/17

Its tail ends in paired globular tail domains (GTDs) thought to bind cargo(3). At nanomolar calcium levels, actin-activated ATPase is low and the molecule is folded. Micromolar calcium concentrations activate ATPase and the molecule unfolds(3-6). Here we describe the structure of folded myosin and the GTD's role in regulating activity. Electron microscopy shows that the two heads lie either side of the tail, contacting the GTDs at a lobe of the motor domain (similar to Pro 117 - Pro 137) that contains conserved acidic side chains, suggesting ionic interactions between motor domain and GTD. Myosin 5 heavy meromyosin, a constitutively active fragment lacking the GTDs, is inhibited and folded by a dimeric GST - GTD fusion protein. Motility assays reveal that at nanomolar calcium levels heavy meromyosin moves robustly on actin filaments whereas few myosins bind or move. These results combine to show that with no cargo, the GTDs bind in an intramolecular manner to the motor domains, producing an inhibited and compact structure that binds weakly to actin and allows the molecule to recycle towards new cargoes.","Univ Leeds, Inst Mol & Cellular Biol, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England; Univ Leeds, Astbury Ctr Struct Mol Biol, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England; NHLBI, Lab Mol Physiol, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; NHLBI, Cell Biol Lab, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA","Knight, PJ (reprint author), Univ Leeds, Inst Mol & Cellular Biol, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England.",p.j.knight@leeds.ac.uk,,"Thirumurugan, Kavitha/0000-0002-4673-4099","Wellcome Trust [, 076057]",,,24,113,115,0,13,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,13-Jul,2006,442,7099,,,,,212,215,,10.1038/nature04865,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,062XJ,WOS:000238979700050,16838021,No,,,11/20/17

These messenger RNAs contain a cis-acting region-which we call the DSR-that confers this removal via binding to a YTH-family protein Mmi1. Loss of Mmi1 function severely impairs cell growth owing to the untimely expression of meiotic transcripts. Microarray analysis reveals that at least a dozen such meiosis-specific transcripts are eliminated by the DSR-Mmi1 system. Mmi1 remains in the form of multiple nuclear foci during vegetative growth. At meiotic prophase these foci precipitate to a single focus, which coincides with the dot formed by the master meiosis-regulator Mei2. A meiotic arrest due to the loss of the Mei2 dot is released by a reduction in Mmi1 activity. We propose that Mei2 turns off the DSR-Mmi1 system by sequestering Mmi1 to the dot and thereby secures stable expression of meiosis-specific transcripts.","Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Sci, Dept Biophys & Biochem, Tokyo 1130033, Japan; Univ Tokyo, Mol Genet Res Lab, Tokyo 1130033, Japan; Natl Inst Informat & Commun Technol, Kansai Adv Res Ctr, Kobe, Hyogo 6512492, Japan","Yamamoto, M (reprint author), Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Sci, Dept Biophys & Biochem, Tokyo 1130033, Japan.",yamamoto@biochem.s.u-tokyo.ac.jp,"Hiraoka, Yasushi/B-5111-2009; Yamashita, Akira/A-5278-2015","Hiraoka, Yasushi/0000-0001-9407-8228; Yamashita, Akira/0000-0002-1805-1434",,,,40,154,158,1,20,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,6-Jul,2006,442,7098,,,,,45,50,,10.1038/nature04881,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,059HS,WOS:000238724500032,16823445,No,,,11/20/17

The two proposed solutions-a coronagraph internal to a telescope and nulling interferometry from formation-flying telescopes-both require exceedingly clean wavefront control in the optics(2). An attractive variation to the coronagraph is to place an occulting shield outside the telescope, blocking the starlight before it even enters the optical path(3). Diffraction and scatter around or through the occulter, however, have limited effective suppression in practically sized missions(4-6). Here I report an occulter design that would achieve the required suppression and can be built with existing technology. The compact mission architecture of a coronagraph is traded for the inconvenience of two spacecraft, but the daunting optics challenges are replaced with a simple deployable sheet 30 to 50 m in diameter.

Sometimes, such a drastic change in behaviour is accompanied by a visible change in appearance. The hallmark of Bose-Einstein condensation and superfluidity in trapped, weakly interacting Bose gases is the sudden formation of a dense central core inside a thermal cloud(1-7). However, in strongly interacting gases-such as the recently observed fermionic superfluids(8)-there is no longer a clear separation between the superfluid and the normal parts of the cloud. The detection of fermion pair condensates has required magnetic field sweeps(9-11) into the weakly interacting regime, and the quantitative description of these sweeps presents a major theoretical challenge. Here we report the direct observation of the superfluid phase transition in a strongly interacting gas of Li-6 fermions, through sudden changes in the shape of the clouds-in complete analogy to the case of weakly interacting Bose gases. By preparing unequal mixtures of the two spin components involved in the pairing(12,13), we greatly enhance the contrast between the superfluid core and the normal component. Furthermore, the distribution of non-interacting excess atoms serves as a direct and reliable thermometer. Even in the normal state, strong interactions significantly deform the density profile of the majority spin component. We show that it is these interactions that drive the normal-to-superfluid transition at the critical population imbalance of 70 +/- 5 per cent (ref. 12).","MIT, MIT Harvard Ctr Ultracold Atoms, Dept Phys, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; MIT, Res Lab Elect, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA","Zwierlein, MW (reprint author), MIT, MIT Harvard Ctr Ultracold Atoms, Dept Phys, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",zwierlei@mit.edu,,"Schunck, Christian H/0000-0002-7917-8180",,,,33,246,247,4,21,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,6-Jul,2006,442,7098,,,,,54,58,,10.1038/nature04936,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,059HS,WOS:000238724500034,16823447,No,,,11/20/17

In high-transition-temperature (high-T-c) copper oxides, it is generally believed that magnetic excitations might play a fundamental role in the superconducting mechanism because superconductivity occurs when mobile 'electrons' or 'holes' are doped into the antiferromagnetic parent compounds(2). Indeed, a sharp magnetic excitation termed 'resonance' has been observed by neutron scattering in a number of hole-doped materials(3-11). The resonance is intimately related to superconductivity(12), and its interaction with charged quasi-particles observed by photoemission(13,14), optical conductivity(15), and tunnelling(16) suggests that it might play a part similar to that of phonons in conventional superconductors. The relevance of the resonance to high-T-c superconductivity, however, has been in doubt because so far it has been found only in hole-doped materials(17). Here we report the discovery of the resonance in electron-doped superconducting Pr0.88LaCe0.12CuO4-delta (T-c = 24 K).

Diffraction from an ideal crystal lattice results in an identical copy of this continuous diffraction pattern at every Bragg peak. This symmetry is broken by the presence of strain fields, which arise from the epitaxial contact forces that are inevitable whenever nanocrystals are prepared on a substrate(4). When strain is present, the diffraction copies at different Bragg peaks are no longer identical and contain additional information, appearing as broken local inversion symmetry about each Bragg point. Here we show that one such pattern can nevertheless be inverted to obtain a 'complex' crystal density, whose phase encodes a projection of the lattice deformation. A lead nanocrystal was crystallized in ultrahigh vacuum from a droplet on a silica substrate and equilibrated close to its melting point. A three-dimensional image of the density, obtained by inversion of the coherent X-ray diffraction, shows the expected facetted morphology, but in addition reveals a real-space phase that is consistent with the three-dimensional evolution of a deformation field arising from interfacial contact forces. Quantitative three-dimensional imaging of lattice strain on the nanometre scale will have profound consequences for our fundamental understanding of grain interactions and defects in crystalline materials(4). Our method of measuring and inverting diffraction patterns from nanocrystals represents a vital step towards the ultimate goal of atomic resolution single-molecule imaging that is a prominent justification for development of X-ray free-electron lasers(5-7).","Univ Illinois, Dept Phys, Urbana, IL 61801 USA","Robinson, IK (reprint author), Univ Oregon, Dept Phys, Eugene, OR 97403 USA.",i.robinson@ucl.ac.uk,"Pfeifer, Mark/C-4132-2011; Williams, Garth/H-1606-2012",,,,,24,360,364,13,132,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,6-Jul,2006,442,7098,,,,,63,66,,10.1038/nature04867,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,059HS,WOS:000238724500036,16823449,No,,,11/20/17

We show that this approach produces unexpected feedback processes, leading to a significantly weaker dynamic strength evolution. In our model, stress localization focused on the brittle-ductile transition leads to the spontaneous development of mid-crustal detachment faults immediately above the strongest crustal layer.

Although it is assumed that these silent earthquakes are located along the plate megathrust, this has not been proved. Slow slip in some subduction zones is associated with non-volcanic tremor(7,8), but tremor is difficult to locate and may be distributed over a broad depth range(9). Except for some events on the San Andreas fault(10), slow-slip events have not yet been associated with high-frequency earthquakes, which are easily located. Here we report on swarms of high-frequency earthquakes that accompany otherwise silent slips on Kilauea volcano, Hawaii. For the most energetic event, in January 2005, the slow slip began before the increase in seismicity. The temporal evolution of earthquakes is well explained by increased stressing caused by slow slip, implying that the earthquakes are triggered. The earthquakes, located at depths of 7-8 km, constrain the slow slip to be at comparable depths, because they must fall in zones of positive Coulomb stress change. Triggered earthquakes accompanying slow-slip events elsewhere might go undetected if background seismicity rates are low. Detection of such events would help constrain the depth of slow slip, and could lead to a method for quantifying the increased hazard during slow-slip events, because triggered events have the potential to grow into destructive earthquakes.","Stanford Univ, Dept Geophys, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; USGS Hawaii Volcano Observ, Hawaii Natl Pk, HI 96718 USA; USGS Alaska Volcano Observ, Anchorage, AK 99508 USA","Segall, P (reprint author), Stanford Univ, Dept Geophys, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",segall@stanford.edu,,,,,,27,105,107,1,24,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,6-Jul,2006,442,7098,,,,,71,74,,10.1038/nature04938,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,059HS,WOS:000238724500038,16823451,No,,,11/20/17

Migration is a double-edged sword in such cases: too little migration prevents recolonization of extinct patches, whereas too much synchronizes subpopulations, raising the likelihood of global extinction. Both edges of this proverbial sword have been explored by manipulating the rate of migration within experimental populations(1,3-6,8). However, few experiments have examined how the evolutionary ecology of fragmented populations depends on the pattern of migration(5). Here, we show that the migration pattern affects both coexistence and evolution within a community of bacterial hosts (Escherichia coli) and viral pathogens (T4 coliphage) distributed across a large network of subpopulations. In particular, different patterns of migration select for distinct pathogen strategies, which we term 'rapacious' and 'prudent'. These strategies define a 'tragedy of the commons'(9): rapacious phage displace prudent variants for shared host resources, but prudent phage are more productive when alone. We find that prudent phage dominate when migration is spatially restricted, while rapacious phage evolve under unrestricted migration. Thus, migration pattern alone can determine whether a de novo tragedy of the commons is resolved in favour of restraint.","Univ Washington, Dept Biol, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; Univ Minnesota, Dept Ecol Evolut & Behav, St Paul, MN 55108 USA; Stanford Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Stanford, CA 94305 USA","Kerr, B (reprint author), Univ Washington, Dept Biol, Box 351800, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.",kerrb@u.washington.edu,"Bohannan, Brendan/R-1582-2017","Bohannan, Brendan/0000-0003-2907-1016",,,,30,194,195,4,74,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,6-Jul,2006,442,7098,,,,,75,78,,10.1038/nature04864,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,059HS,WOS:000238724500039,16823452,No,,,11/20/17

We have previously reported koala retrovirus (KoRV) to be a functional virus that is associated with neoplasia(3). Here we show that KoRV also shows features of a recently inserted endogenous retrovirus that is vertically transmitted. The finding that some isolated koala populations have not yet incorporated KoRV into their genomes, combined with its high level of activity and variability in individual koalas, suggests that KoRV is a virus in transition between an exogenous and endogenous element. This ongoing dynamic interaction with a wild species provides an exciting opportunity to study the process and consequences of retroviral endogenization in action, and is an attractive model for studying the evolutionary event in which a retrovirus invades a mammalian genome.","Univ Queensland, Sch Mol & Microbial Sci, St Lucia, Qld 4072, Australia; Univ Queensland, Sch Vet Sci, St Lucia, Qld 4072, Australia","Young, PR (reprint author), Univ Queensland, Sch Mol & Microbial Sci, St Lucia, Qld 4072, Australia.",p.young@uq.edu.au,"Meers, Joanne/B-4141-2011; Tarlinton, Rachael/H-1712-2011; Young, Paul/A-6176-2010","Tarlinton, Rachael/0000-0003-3325-2311; Young, Paul/0000-0002-2040-5190",,,,21,168,173,2,67,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,6-Jul,2006,442,7098,,,,,79,81,,10.1038/nature04841,,3,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,059HS,WOS:000238724500040,16823453,No,,,11/20/17

The latency-associated transcript (LAT) of herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV-1) is the only viral gene expressed during latent infection in neurons(3). LAT inhibits apoptosis and maintains latency by promoting the survival of infected neurons(4). No protein product has been attributed to the LAT gene and the mechanism by which LAT protects cells from apoptosis is not yet known. Here we show that a miRNA encoded by the HSV-1 LAT gene confers resistance to apoptosis. Neuroblastoma cells transfected with a fragment of the LAT gene show reduced susceptibility to cell death. The anti-apoptotic function of LAT has been mapped to a region within the first exon(5,6). We have identified and characterized a microRNA (miR-LAT) generated from the exon 1 region of the HSV-1 LAT gene. The LAT miRNA was found to accumulate in cells transiently transfected with the LAT gene fragment or infected with a wild-type strain of HSV-1. A mutant virus in which a 372-nucleotide fragment encompassing the mature miRNA was deleted neither protected the infected cells from apoptosis nor generated an miRNA. miR-LAT exerts its antiapoptotic effect by downregulation of transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta 1 and SMAD3 expression, both of which are functionally linked in the TGF-beta pathway. Our results suggest that the miRNA encoded by the HSV-1 LAT gene regulates the induction of apoptosis in infected cells by modulation of TGF-beta signalling and thus contributes to the persistence of HSV in a latent form in sensory neurons.","Univ Penn, Sch Med, Dept Microbiol, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; Univ Penn, Sch Med, Dept Genet, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; Univ Penn, Sch Med, Penn Ctr Bioinformat, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA","Fraser, NW (reprint author), Univ Penn, Sch Med, Dept Microbiol, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",nwfraser@mail.med.upenn.edu,,,,,,22,186,225,4,27,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,6-Jul,2006,442,7098,,,,,82,85,,10.1038/nature04836,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,059HS,WOS:000238724500041,16738545,No,,,11/20/17

Depletion of H3K4me3 causes partial release of the NURF subunit, BPTF (bromodomain and PHD finger transcription factor), from chromatin and defective recruitment of the associated ATPase, SNF2L (also known as ISWI and SMARCA1), to the HOXC8 promoter. Loss of BPTF in Xenopus embryos mimics WDR5 loss-of-function phenotypes, and compromises spatial control of Hox gene expression. These results strongly suggest that WDR5 and NURF function in a common biological pathway in vivo, and that NURF-mediated ATP-dependent chromatin remodelling is directly coupled to H3K4 trimethylation to maintain Hox gene expression patterns during development.

A major challenge in chromatin biology has centred on efforts to define the connection between specific methylation states and distinct biological readouts impacting on function(4). For example, histone H3 trimethylated at lysine 4 (H3K4me3) is associated with transcription start sites of active genes(5-7), but the molecular 'effectors' involved in specific recognition of H3K4me3 tails remain poorly understood. Here we demonstrate the molecular basis for specific recognition of H3(1-15)K4me3 (residues 1-15 of histone H3 trimethylated at K4) by a plant homeodomain (PHD) finger of human BPTF (bromodomain and PHD domain transcription factor), the largest subunit of the ATP-dependent chromatin-remodelling complex, NURF (nucleosome remodelling factor). We report on crystallographic and NMR structures of the bromodomain-proximal PHD finger of BPTF in free and H3(1-15)K4me3-bound states. H3(1-15)K4me3 interacts through anti-parallel beta-sheet formation on the surface of the PHD finger, with the long side chains of arginine 2 (R2) and K4me3 fitting snugly in adjacent pre-formed surface pockets, and bracketing an invariant tryptophan. The observed stapling role by non-adjacent R2 and K4me3 provides a molecular explanation for H3K4me3 site specificity. Binding studies establish that the BPTF PHD finger exhibits a modest preference for K4me3- over K4me2-containing H3 peptides, and discriminates against monomethylated and unmodified counterparts. Furthermore, we identified key specificity-determining residues from binding studies of H3(1-15)K4me3 with PHD finger point mutants.

Much attention has focused on methylation at lysine 4 of histone H3 (H3K4), owing to its association with euchromatic genomic regions(3,4). H3K4 can be mono-, di- or tri-methylated. Trimethylated H3K4 (H3K4me3) is preferentially detected at active genes, and is proposed to promote gene expression through recognition by transcription-activating effector molecules(5). Here we identify a novel class of methylated H3K4 effector domains-the PHD domains of the ING (for inhibitor of growth) family of tumour suppressor proteins. The ING PHD domains are specific and highly robust binding modules for H3K4me3 and H3K4me2. ING2, a native subunit of a repressive mSin3a-HDAC1 histone deacetylase complex(6), binds with high affinity to the trimethylated species. In response to DNA damage, recognition of H3K4me3 by the ING2 PHD domain stabilizes the mSin3a-HDAC1 complex at the promoters of proliferation genes. This pathway constitutes a new mechanism by which H3K4me3 functions in active gene repression. Furthermore, ING2 modulates cellular responses to genotoxic insults, and these functions are critically dependent on ING2 interaction with H3K4me3. Together, our findings establish a pivotal role for trimethylation of H3K4 in gene repression and, potentially, tumour suppressor mechanisms.","Stanford Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Dept Med, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; Univ Colorado, Hlth Sci Ctr, Dept Pharmacol, Aurora, CO 80045 USA; Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Pathol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; Univ Utah, Huntsman Canc Inst, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA; Univ Utah, Dept Oncol Sci, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA; Univ Laval, Ctr Canc Res, Quebec City, PQ G1R 2J6, Canada; VA Palo Alto Hlth Care Syst, Ctr Geriatr Res Educ & Clin, Palo Alto, CA 94304 USA","Gozani, O (reprint author), Stanford Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",ogozani@stanford.edu,"Cote, Jacques/I-8901-2014","Cote, Jacques/0000-0001-6751-555X; Cayrou, Christelle/0000-0002-6910-8023; Shi, Xiaobing/0000-0001-5242-8189; Ewalt, Mark/0000-0003-4245-752X","Canadian Institutes of Health Research [64289-1]; Howard Hughes Medical Institute; NIGMS NIH HHS [R01 GM060415, R01 GM060415-06]",,,23,585,615,3,35,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,6-Jul,2006,442,7098,,,,,96,99,,10.1038/nature04835,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,059HS,WOS:000238724500044,16728974,No,,,11/20/17

Substitution of the binding site residues disrupts H3K4me3 interaction in vitro and impairs the ability of ING2 to induce apoptosis in vivo. Strong binding of other ING and YNG PHD fingers suggests that the recognition of H3K4me3 histone code is a general feature of the ING/YNG proteins. Elucidation of the mechanisms underlying this novel function of PHD fingers provides a basis for deciphering the role of the ING family of tumour suppressors in chromatin regulation and signalling.","Univ Colorado, Hlth Sci Ctr, Dept Pharmacol, Aurora, CO 80045 USA; Univ Colorado, Hlth Sci Ctr, Dept Biochem & Mol Genet, Aurora, CO 80045 USA; Stanford Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; Albert Einstein Coll Med, Dept Anat & Struct Biol, Bronx, NY 10461 USA","Kutateladze, TG (reprint author), Univ Colorado, Hlth Sci Ctr, Dept Pharmacol, Aurora, CO 80045 USA.",Tatiana.Kutateladze@uchsc.edu,,"Shi, Xiaobing/0000-0001-5242-8189",NCI NIH HHS [R01 CA113472]; NIGMS NIH HHS [R01 GM071424],,,27,439,448,1,26,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,6-Jul,2006,442,7098,,,,,100,103,,10.1038/nature04814,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,059HS,WOS:000238724500045,16728977,No,,,11/20/17

To test directly the physiological relevance of circulating cells for female fertility, we established transplantation and parabiotic mouse models to assess the capacity of circulating bone marrow cells to generate ovulated oocytes, both in the steady state and after induced damage. Our studies showed no evidence that bone marrow cells, or any other normally circulating cells, contribute to the formation of mature, ovulated oocytes.

Conventional long-range order, as in a ferromagnet or a crystal, is common in three-dimensional systems at low temperature. However, in two-dimensional systems with a continuous symmetry, true long-range order is destroyed by thermal fluctuations at any finite temperature(1,2). Consequently, for the case of identical bosons, a uniform two-dimensional fluid cannot undergo Bose-Einstein condensation, in contrast to the three-dimensional case. However, the two-dimensional system can form a 'quasi-condensate' and become superfluid below a finite critical temperature. The Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) theory(3,4) associates this phase transition with the emergence of a topological order, resulting from the pairing of vortices with opposite circulation. Above the critical temperature, proliferation of unbound vortices is expected. Here we report the observation of a BKT-type crossover in a trapped quantum degenerate gas of rubidium atoms. Using a matter wave heterodyning technique, we observe both the long-wavelength fluctuations of the quasi-condensate phase and the free vortices. At low temperatures, the gas is quasi-coherent on the length scale set by the system size. As the temperature is increased, the loss of long-range coherence coincides with the onset of proliferation of free vortices. Our results provide direct experimental evidence for the microscopic mechanism underlying the BKT theory, and raise new questions regarding coherence and superfluidity in mesoscopic systems.","Ecole Normale Super, Lab Kastler Brossel, F-75231 Paris 05, France","Dalibard, J (reprint author), Ecole Normale Super, Lab Kastler Brossel, 24 Rue Lhomond, F-75231 Paris 05, France.",jean.dalibard@lkb.ens.fr,"Kruger, Peter/B-3407-2009; Hadzibabic, Zoran/B-8102-2011; Cheneau, Marc/O-9312-2014; Dalibard, Jean/M-5648-2015; Kruger, Peter/H-2832-2017","Hadzibabic, Zoran/0000-0002-0118-9285; Cheneau, Marc/0000-0001-7261-566X; Dalibard, Jean/0000-0001-8469-3913; Kruger, Peter/0000-0001-9908-6454",,,,29,504,505,4,42,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,28-Jun,2006,441,7097,,,,,1118,1121,,10.1038/nature04851,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,057SM,WOS:000238615500043,16810249,No,,,11/20/17

They are not generally considered for their optical and electronic properties. Elemental semiconductors with nanopores running through them represent a different form of framework material with physical characteristics contrasting with those of the more conventional bulk, thin film and nanocrystalline forms(1). Here we describe cubic mesostructured germanium, MSU-Ge-1, with gyroidal channels containing surfactant molecules, separated by amorphous walls that lie on the gyroid (G) minimal surface as in the mesoporous silica MCM-48 (ref. 2). Although Ge is a high-melting, covalent semiconductor that is difficult to prepare from solution polymerization, we succeeded in assembling a continuous Ge network using a suitable precursor for Ge 42 atoms. Our results indicate that elemental semiconductors from group 14 of the periodic table can be made to adopt mesostructured forms such as MSU-Ge-1, which features two three-dimensional labyrinthine tunnels obeying Ia (3) over bard space group symmetry and separated by a continuous germanium minimal surface that is otherwise amorphous.

Co-assembly of inorganic precursor molecules with amphiphilic organic molecules is followed first by inorganic condensation to produce rigid amorphous frameworks and then, by template removal, to produce mesoporous solids. A range of periodic surfactant/semiconductor and surfactant/metal composites have also been produced by similar methods(6-11), but for virtually all the non-oxide semiconducting phases, the surfactant unfortunately cannot be removed to generate porous materials. Here we show that it is possible to use surfactant-driven self-organization of soluble Zintl clusters to produce periodic, nanoporous versions of classic semiconductors such as amorphous Ge or Ge/Si alloys. Specifically, we use derivatives of the anionic Ge-9(4-) cluster(12-14), a compound whose use in the synthesis of nanoscale materials is established(15). Moreover, because of the small size, high surface area, and flexible chemistry of these materials, we can tune optical properties in these nanoporous semiconductors through quantum confinement(16,17), by adsorption of surface species, or by altering the elemental composition of the inorganic framework. Because the semiconductor surface is exposed and accessible in these materials, they have the potential to interact with a range of species in ways that could eventually lead to new types of sensors or other novel nanostructured devices.","Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Chem & Biochem, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA","Tolbert, SH (reprint author), Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Chem & Biochem, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.",tolbert@chem.ucla.edu,"Cadby, Ashley/H-3679-2013; Tolbert, Sarah/L-2321-2016","Cadby, Ashley/0000-0002-5472-8625; ",,,,30,165,166,5,105,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,28-Jun,2006,441,7097,,,,,1126,1130,,10.1038/nature04891,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,057SM,WOS:000238615500045,16810251,No,,,11/20/17

Relatively localized transients are known to occur as both seismic and episodic aseismic events(1), and are generally ascribed to motions of magma bodies, aseismic creep on faults, or elastic or viscoelastic effects associated with earthquakes. However, triggering phenomena(2,3) and systematic patterns of seismic strain release at subcontinental (similar to 1,000 km) scale along diffuse plate boundaries(4,5) have long suggested that energy transfer occurs at larger scale. Such transfer appears to occur by the interaction of stresses induced by surface wave propagation and magma or groundwater in the crust(6), or from large-scale stress diffusion within the oceanic mantle in the decades following clusters of great earthquakes(7). Here we report geodetic evidence for a coherent, subcontinental-scale change in tectonic velocity along a diffuse similar to 1,000-km-wide deformation zone. Our observations are derived from continuous GPS (Global Positioning System) data collected over the past decade across the Basin and Range province, which absorbs approximately 25 per cent of Pacific-North America relative plate motion. The observed changes in site velocity define a sharp boundary near the centre of the province oriented roughly parallel to the north-northwest relative plate motion vector.

Distant earthquakes may even increase the permeability in faults(8). Most of these hydrological observations can be explained by some form of permeability increase(1,5). Here we use the response of water well levels to solid Earth tides to measure permeability over a 20-year period. At the time of each of seven earthquakes in Southern California, we observe transient changes of up to 24 degrees in the phase of the water level response to the dilatational volumetric strain of the semidiurnal tidal components of wells at the Pinon Flat Observatory in Southern California. After the earthquakes, the phase gradually returns to the background value at a rate of less than 0.1 degrees per day. We use a model of axisymmetric flow driven by an imposed head oscillation through a single, laterally extensive, confined, homogeneous and isotropic aquifer to relate the phase response to aquifer properties(9). We interpret the changes in phase response as due to changes in permeability. At the time of the earthquakes, the permeability at the site increases by a factor as high as three. The permeability increase depends roughly linearly on the amplitude of seismic-wave peak ground velocity in the range of 0.21-2.1 cm s(-1). Such permeability increases are of interest to hydrologists and oil reservoir engineers as they affect fluid flow and might determine long-term evolution of hydrological and oil-bearing systems. They may also be interesting to seismologists, as the resulting pore pressure changes can affect earthquakes by changing normal stresses on faults(10).","Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Earth & Space Sci, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Earth Sci, Santa Cruz, CA 95060 USA; Univ Calif San Diego, Scripps Inst Oceanog, Inst Geophys & Planetary Phys, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA","Elkhoury, JE (reprint author), Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Earth & Space Sci, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.",elkhoury@ess.ucla.edu,"Brodsky, Emily/B-9139-2014","Agnew, Duncan/0000-0002-2360-7783; Brodsky, Emily/0000-0002-6855-6860",,,,22,159,176,0,37,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,28-Jun,2006,441,7097,,,,,1135,1138,,10.1038/nature04798,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,057SM,WOS:000238615500047,16810253,No,,,11/20/17

Most of this research, however, has been isolated from the immigration and emigration (dispersal) processes that create and maintain diversity in nature(3-5). As common anthropogenic drivers of biodiversity change-such as habitat fragmentation, species introductions and climate change-are mediated by these understudied processes(5-7), it is unclear how environmental degradation will affect ecosystem services(3,4). Here we tested the interactive effects of mobile grazer diversity and dispersal on the magnitude and stability of ecosystem properties in experimental seagrass communities that were either isolated or connected by dispersal corridors. We show that, contrary to theoretical predictions(2,8-11), increasing the number of mobile grazer species in these metacommunities increased the spatial and temporal variability of primary and secondary production. Moreover, allowing grazers to move among and select patches reduced diversity effects on production. Finally, effects of diversity on stability differed qualitatively between patch and metacommunity scales. Our results indicate that declining biodiversity and habitat fragmentation synergistically influence the predictability of ecosystem functioning.","Coll William & Mary, Sch Marine Sci, Gloucester Point, VA 23062 USA; Coll William & Mary, Virginia Inst Marine Sci, Gloucester Point, VA 23062 USA","France, KE (reprint author), Coll William & Mary, Sch Marine Sci, Gloucester Point, VA 23062 USA.",kfrance@vims.edu,,,,,,30,77,80,9,117,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,28-Jun,2006,441,7097,,,,,1139,1143,,10.1038/nature04729,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,057SM,WOS:000238615500048,16810254,No,,,11/20/17

Here we report NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) receptor-dependent redistribution of proteasomes from dendritic shafts to synaptic spines upon synaptic stimulation, providing a mechanism for local protein degradation. Using a proteasome-activity reporter and local perfusion, we show that synaptic stimulation regulates proteasome activity locally in the dendrites. We used restricted photobleaching of individual spines and dendritic shafts to reveal the dynamics that underlie proteasome sequestration, and show that activity modestly enhances the entry rate of proteasomes into spines while dramatically reducing their exit rate. Proteasome sequestration is persistent, reflecting an association with the actin-based cytoskeleton. Together, our data indicate that synaptic activity can promote the recruitment and sequestration of proteasomes to locally remodel the protein composition of synapses.","CALTECH, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Div Biol, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA","Schuman, EM (reprint author), CALTECH, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Div Biol, 114-96, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA.",schumane@caltech.edu,"Schuman, Erin/D-6204-2011",,,,,30,173,178,0,12,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,28-Jun,2006,441,7097,,,,,1144,1148,,10.1038/nature04769,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,057SM,WOS:000238615500049,16810255,No,,,11/20/17

This occurs within specialized root organs-nodules-that provide the conditions required for nitrogen fixation. A rhizobium-derived signalling molecule, Nod factor, is required to establish the symbiosis. Perception of Nod factor in the plant leads to the induction of Ca2+ oscillations(1), and the transduction of this Ca2+ signal requires DMI3 (refs 2, 3), which encodes the protein kinase Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CCaMK). Central to the regulation of CCaMK is an autoinhibitory domain that negatively regulates kinase activity. Here we show that the specific removal of the autoinhibition domain leads to the autoactivation of the nodulation signalling pathway in the plant, with the resultant induction of nodules and nodulation gene expression in the absence of bacterial elicitation. This autoactivation requires nodulation-specific transcriptional regulators in the GRAS family. This work demonstrates that the release of autoinhibition from CCaMK after calmodulin binding is a central switch that is sufficient to activate nodule morphogenesis. The fact that a single regulation event is sufficient to induce nodulation highlights the possibility of transferring this process to non-legumes.","John Innes Ctr Plant Sci Res, Dept Dis & Stress Biol, Norwich NR4 7UH, Norfolk, England; Washington State Univ, Ctr Integrated Biotechnol, Pullman, WA 99164 USA; Washington State Univ, Dept Hort, Pullman, WA 99164 USA","Oldroyd, GED (reprint author), John Innes Ctr Plant Sci Res, Dept Dis & Stress Biol, Norwich NR4 7UH, Norfolk, England.",giles.oldroyd@bbsrc.ac.uk,,,,,,20,201,217,1,48,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,28-Jun,2006,441,7097,,,,,1149,1152,,10.1038/nature04812,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,057SM,WOS:000238615500050,16810256,No,,,11/20/17

In an ethylmethane sulphonate-induced snf1 (spontaneous nodule formation) mutant of Lotus japonicus, a single amino-acid replacement in a Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CCaMK) is sufficient to turn fully differentiated root cortical cells into meristematic founder cells of root nodule primordia. These spontaneous nodules are genuine nodules with an ontogeny similar to that of rhizobial-induced root nodules, corroborating previous physiological studies(1). Using two receptor-deficient genetic backgrounds we provide evidence for a developmentally integrated spontaneous nodulation process that is independent of lipochitin-oligosaccharide signal perception and oscillations in Ca2+ second messenger levels.

Transgenic expression of Parkin markedly ameliorated all PINK1 loss-of-function phenotypes, but not vice versa, suggesting that Parkin functions downstream of PINK1.

Mitochondrial dysfunction has been implicated as an important trigger for Parkinson's disease-like pathogenesis because exposure to environmental mitochondrial toxins leads to Parkinson's disease-like pathology(1). Recently, multiple genes mediating familial forms of Parkinson's disease have been identified, including PTEN-induced kinase 1 (PINK1; PARK6) and parkin (PARK2), which are also associated with sporadic forms of Parkinson's disease(2-6). PINK1 encodes a putative serine/threonine kinase with a mitochondrial targeting sequence(2). So far, no in vivo studies have been reported for pink1 in any model system. Here we show that removal of Drosophila PINK1 homologue (CG4523; hereafter called pink1) function results in male sterility, apoptotic muscle degeneration, defects in mitochondrial morphology and increased sensitivity to multiple stresses including oxidative stress. Pink1 localizes to mitochondria, and mitochondrial cristae are fragmented in pink1 mutants. Expression of human PINK1 in the Drosophila testes restores male fertility and normal mitochondrial morphology in a portion of pink1 mutants, demonstrating functional conservation between human and Drosophila Pink1. Loss of Drosophila parkin shows phenotypes similar to loss of pink1 function(7,8). Notably, overexpression of parkin rescues the male sterility and mitochondrial morphology defects of pink1 mutants, whereas double mutants removing both pink1 and parkin function show muscle phenotypes identical to those observed in either mutant alone. These observations suggest that pink1 and parkin function, at least in part, in the same pathway, with pink1 functioning upstream of parkin. The role of the pink1-parkin pathway in regulating mitochondrial function underscores the importance of mitochondrial dysfunction as a central mechanism of Parkinson's disease pathogenesis.","Univ Calif Los Angeles, David Geffen Sch Med, Brain Res Inst, Dept Neurol, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; CALTECH, Div Biol, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA; Seoul Natl Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Seoul 151742, South Korea; Kyung Hee Univ, Kyung Hee Inst Age Related & Brains Dis, Dept Biol, Seoul 130701, South Korea","Guo, M (reprint author), Univ Calif Los Angeles, David Geffen Sch Med, Brain Res Inst, Dept Neurol, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.",mingfly@ucla.edu,,,,,,30,883,909,10,106,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,28-Jun,2006,441,7097,,,,,1162,1166,,10.1038/nature04779,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,057SM,WOS:000238615500053,16672981,No,,,11/20/17

Here we describe a 2.05 angstrom crystal structure of a riboswitch domain from the Escherichia coli thiM mRNA(4) that responds to the coenzyme thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP). TPP is an active form of vitamin B-1, an essential participant in many protein-catalysed reactions(5). Organisms from all three domains of life(6-9), including bacteria, plants and fungi, use TPP-sensing riboswitches to control genes responsible for importing or synthesizing thiamine and its phosphorylated derivatives, making this riboswitch class themostwidely distributed member of the metabolite-sensing RNA regulatory system. The structure reveals a complex folded RNA in which one subdomain forms an intercalation pocket for the 4-amino-5-hydroxymethyl-2-methylpyrimidine moiety of TPP, whereas another subdomain forms a wider pocket that uses bivalent metal ions and water molecules to make bridging contacts to the pyrophosphate moiety of the ligand. The two pockets are positioned to function as a molecular measuring device that recognizes TPP in an extended conformation. The central thiazole moiety is not recognized by the RNA, which explains why the antimicrobial compound pyrithiamine pyrophosphate targets this riboswitch and downregulates the expression of thiamine metabolic genes. Both the natural ligand and its drug-like analogue stabilize secondary and tertiary structure elements that are harnessed by the riboswitch to modulate the synthesis of the proteins coded by the mRNA.

Regulation occurs through the interplay of two domains of the RNA: an aptamer domain that responds to intracellular metabolite concentrations and an expression platform that uses two mutually exclusive secondary structures to direct a decision-making process. In Gram-positive bacteria such as Bacillus species, riboswitches control the expression of more than 2% of all genes through their ability to respond to a diverse set of metabolites including amino acids, nucleobases and protein cofactors(1,2). Here we report the 2.9-angstrom resolution crystal structure of an S-adenosylmethionine (SAM)-responsive riboswitch from Thermoanaerobacter tengcongensis complexed with S-adenosylmethionine, an RNA element that controls the expression of several genes involved in sulphur and methionine metabolism(3-6). This RNA folds into a complex three-dimensional architecture that recognizes almost every functional group of the ligand through a combination of direct and indirect readout mechanisms. Ligand binding induces the formation of a series of tertiary interactions with one of the helices, serving as a communication link between the aptamer and expression platform domains.","Univ Colorado, Dept Chem & Biochem, Boulder, CO 80309 USA","Batey, RT (reprint author), Univ Colorado, Dept Chem & Biochem, 215 UCB, Boulder, CO 80309 USA.",robert.batey@colorado.edu,"Batey, Robert/A-8265-2009","Batey, Robert/0000-0002-1384-6625",,,,29,248,259,3,31,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,28-Jun,2006,441,7097,,,,,1172,1175,,10.1038/nature04819,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,057SM,WOS:000238615500055,16810258,No,,,11/20/17

Internal viscosity from magnetic processes(1-4) and disk winds(5) can both in principle transfer angular momentum, but hitherto we lacked evidence that either occurs. Here we report that an X-ray-absorbing wind discovered in an observation of the stellar-mass black hole binary GRO J1655-40 ( ref. 6) must be powered by a magnetic process that can also drive accretion through the disk. Detailed spectral analysis and modelling of the wind shows that it can only be powered by pressure generated by magnetic viscosity internal to the disk or magnetocentrifugal forces.

This is illustrated by ferroelectric 'relaxors'(1-4) such as Pb(Mg1/3Nb2/3) O-3-PbTiO3 (PMN-PT; refs 5, 6): these materials exhibit a giant electromechanical ( piezoelectric) response that is finding use in ultrasonic(4) and medical applications, as well as in telecommunications. The origins of this effect are, however, still unclear. Here we show that the giant electromechanical response in PMN-PT ( and potentially other ferroelectric relaxors) is the manifestation of critical points that define a line in the phase diagram of this system. Specifically, in the electric-field -temperature-composition phase diagram of PMN-PT ( the composition being varied by changing the PT concentration), a first-order paraelectric ferroelectric phase transition terminates in a line of critical points where the piezoelectric coefficient is maximum. Above this line, supercritical evolution is observed. On approaching the critical point, both the energy cost and the electric field necessary to induce ferroelectric polarization rotations decrease significantly, thus explaining the giant electromechanical response of these relaxors.","Jozef Stefan Inst, Ljubljana, Slovenia; Acad Sci Czech Republ, Inst Phys, Prague, Czech Republic","Kutnjak, Z (reprint author), Jozef Stefan Inst, Ljubljana, Slovenia.",zdravko.kutnjak@ijs.si,"Kutnjak, Zdravko/B-4412-2013; Petzelt, Jan/G-6142-2014","Petzelt, Jan/0000-0001-8562-2148",,,,17,387,393,16,172,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,22-Jun,2006,441,7096,,,,,956,959,,10.1038/nature04854,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,055AT,WOS:000238422300036,16791189,No,,,11/20/17

Recently, optical gain with a 1-nm bandwidth was demonstrated using the Raman effect(1-9), which led to the demonstration of a Raman oscillator(10,11), lossless optical modulation(12) and optically tunable slow light(13). A key strength of optical communications is the parallelism of information transfer and processing onto multiple wavelength channels. However, the relatively narrow Raman gain bandwidth only allows for amplification or generation of a single wavelength channel. If broad gain bandwidths were to be demonstrated on silicon, then an array of wavelength channels could be generated and processed, representing a critical advance for densely integrated photonic circuits. Here we demonstrate net on/off gain over a wavelength range of 28 nm through the optical process of phase-matched four-wave mixing in suitably designed SOI channel waveguides. We also demonstrate wavelength conversion in the range 1,511 - 1,591 nm with peak conversion efficiencies of +15.2 dB, which represents more than 20 times improvement on previous four-wave-mixing efficiencies in SOI waveguides(14-17). These advances allow for the implementation of dense wavelength division multiplexing in an all-silicon photonic integrated circuit. Additionally, all-optical delays(18), all-optical switches(19), optical signal regenerators(20) and optical sources for quantum information technology(21), all demonstrated using four-wave mixing in silica fibres, can now be transferred to the SOI platform.","Cornell Univ, Sch Appl & Engn Phys, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; Cornell Univ, Sch Elect & Comp Engn, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA","Gaeta, AL (reprint author), Cornell Univ, Sch Appl & Engn Phys, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",a.gaeta@cornell.edu,"Foster, Amy/E-8009-2010; Foster, Mark/E-8011-2010","Foster, Mark/0000-0002-4524-141X",,,,30,514,520,10,126,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,22-Jun,2006,441,7096,,,,,960,963,,10.1038/nature04932,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,055AT,WOS:000238422300037,16791190,No,,,11/20/17

Box model studies(1-4) first pointed out that an increase in nutrient utilization in the high latitudes results in a strong decrease in the atmospheric carbon dioxide partial pressure (p(CO2)). This early research led to two important ideas: high latitude regions are more important in determining atmospheric p(CO2) than low latitudes, despite their much smaller area, and nutrient utilization and atmospheric p(CO2) are tightly linked. Subsequent general circulation model simulations show that the Southern Ocean is the most important high latitude region in controlling preindustrial atmospheric CO2 because it serves as a lid to a larger volume of the deep ocean(5,6). Other studies point out the crucial role of the Southern Ocean in the uptake and storage of anthropogenic carbon dioxide(7) and in controlling global biological production(8). Here we probe the system to determine whether certain regions of the Southern Ocean are more critical than others for air - sea CO2 balance and the biological export production, by increasing surface nutrient drawdown in an ocean general circulation model. We demonstrate that atmospheric CO2 and global biological export production are controlled by different regions of the Southern Ocean. The air - sea balance of carbon dioxide is controlled mainly by the biological pump and circulation in the Antarctic deep-water formation region, whereas global export production is controlled mainly by the biological pump and circulation in the Subantarctic intermediate and mode water formation region. The existence of this biogeochemical divide separating the Antarctic from the Subantarctic suggests that it may be possible for climate change or human intervention to modify one of these without greatly altering the other.","Princeton Univ, Atmospher & Ocean Sci Program, Princeton, NJ 08540 USA; NOAA, Geophys Fluid Dynam Lab, Princeton, NJ 08542 USA","Marinov, I (reprint author), MIT, Program Atmospheres Oceans & Climate, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",imarinov@mit.edu,"Gnanadesikan, Anand/A-2397-2008","Gnanadesikan, Anand/0000-0001-5784-1116",,,,28,140,144,4,73,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,22-Jun,2006,441,7096,,,,,964,967,,10.1038/nature04883,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,055AT,WOS:000238422300038,16791191,No,,,11/20/17

The two most recent great earthquakes on this fault ruptured its northern and central sections in 1906 and 1857, respectively. The southern section of the fault, however, has not produced a great earthquake in historic times ( for at least 250 years). Assuming the average slip rate of a few centimetres per year, typical of the rest of the San Andreas fault, the minimum amount of slip deficit accrued on the southern section is of the order of 7 - 10 metres, comparable to the maximum co-seismic offset ever documented on the fault(1,2). Here I present high-resolution measurements of interseismic deformation across the southern San Andreas fault system using a well-populated catalogue of space-borne synthetic aperture radar data. The data reveal a nearly equal partitioning of deformation between the southern San Andreas and San Jacinto faults, with a pronounced asymmetry in strain accumulation with respect to the geologically mapped fault traces.

This apparent evolutionary puzzle may be explained by the altruist's gain in social image: image-scoring bystanders, also known as eavesdroppers, notice the altruistic act and therefore are more likely to help the altruist in the future(5-7). Such complex indirect reciprocity based on altruistic acts may evolve only after simple indirect reciprocity has been established, which requires two steps. First, image scoring evolves when bystanders gain personal benefits from information gathered, for example, by finding cooperative partners(8-10). Second, altruistic behaviour in the presence of such bystanders may evolve if altruists benefit from access to the bystanders. Here, we provide experimental evidence for both of the requirements in a cleaning mutualism involving the cleaner fish Labroides dimidiatus. These cleaners may cooperate and remove ectoparasites from clients or they may cheat by feeding on client mucus(11,12). As mucus may be preferred over typical client ectoparasites(13), clients must make cleaners feed against their preference to obtain a cooperative service. We found that eavesdropping clients spent more time next to 'cooperative' than 'unknown cooperative level' cleaners, which shows that clients engage in image-scoring behaviour. Furthermore, trained cleaners learned to feed more cooperatively when in an `image-scoring' than in a 'non-image-scoring' situation.","Univ Neuchatel, Dept Zool, CH-2009 Neuchatel, Switzerland; Univ Queensland, Sch Integrat Biol, St Lucia, Qld 4072, Australia","Bshary, R (reprint author), Univ Neuchatel, Dept Zool, Rue Emile Argand 11,Case Postale 158, CH-2009 Neuchatel, Switzerland.",redouan.bshary@unine.ch,"Grutter, Alexandra/J-2737-2013","Grutter, Alexandra/0000-0003-1688-2821",,,,28,169,174,3,113,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,22-Jun,2006,441,7096,,,,,975,978,,10.1038/nature04755,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,055AT,WOS:000238422300041,16791194,No,,,11/20/17

Growth and retraction of dendritic spines with synapse formation and elimination could change brain circuits(2-7). In the apical tufts of layer 5B (L5B) pyramidal neurons in the mouse barrel cortex, a subset of dendritic spines appear and disappear over days, whereas most spines are persistent for months(4-6,8,9). Under baseline conditions, new spines are mostly transient and rarely survive for more than a week. Transient spines tend to be small(4,5,9), whereas persistent spines are usually large(4-6,8,9). Because most excitatory synapses in the cortex occur on spines, and because synapse size(10) and the number of alpha-amino-3- hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid ( AMPA) receptors(11-13) are proportional to spine volume, the excitation of pyramidal neurons is probably driven through synapses on persistent spines. Here we test whether the generation and loss of persistent spines are enhanced by novel sensory experience. We repeatedly imaged dendritic spines for one month after trimming alternate whiskers, a paradigm that induces adaptive functional changes in neocortical circuits(14,15). Whisker trimming stabilized new spines and destabilized previously persistent spines. New-persistent spines always formed synapses. They were preferentially added on L5B neurons with complex apical tufts rather than simple tufts. Our data indicate that novel sensory experience drives the stabilization of new spines on subclasses of cortical neurons. These synaptic changes probably underlie experience-dependent remodelling of specific neocortical circuits.","Cold Spring Harbor Lab, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Cold Spring Harbor, NY 11724 USA; Univ Lausanne, IBCM, CH-1005 Lausanne, Switzerland","Svoboda, K (reprint author), Cold Spring Harbor Lab, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Cold Spring Harbor, NY 11724 USA.",svoboda@cshl.edu,"Wilbrecht, Linda/J-7988-2013","Knott, Graham W/0000-0002-2956-9052",,,,30,356,361,0,32,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,22-Jun,2006,441,7096,,,,,979,983,,10.1038/nature04783,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,055AT,WOS:000238422300042,16791195,No,,,11/20/17

This contrasts with other vertebrates such as birds, where the death of hair cells causes surrounding supporting cells to re-enter the cell cycle and give rise to both new hair cells and supporting cells(1,2). It is not clear whether the lack of mammalian hair cell regeneration is due to an intrinsic inability of supporting cells to divide and differentiate or to an absence or blockade of regenerative signals. Here we show that post-mitotic supporting cells(3) purified from the postnatal mouse cochlea retain the ability to divide and trans-differentiate into new hair cells in culture. Furthermore, we show that age-dependent changes in supporting cell proliferative capacity are due in part to changes in the ability to downregulate the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27(Kip1) ( also known as Cdkn1b). These results indicate that postnatal mammalian supporting cells are potential targets for therapeutic manipulation.","House Ear Res Inst, Gonda Dept Cell & Mol Biol, Los Angeles, CA 90057 USA; Univ So Calif, Keck Sch Med, Dept Cell & Neurobiol, Los Angeles, CA 90033 USA","Groves, AK (reprint author), House Ear Res Inst, Gonda Dept Cell & Mol Biol, 2100 W 3rd St, Los Angeles, CA 90057 USA.",agroves@hei.org; nsegil@hei.org,,"Groves, Andrew/0000-0002-0784-7998","NIDCD NIH HHS [F32 DC005282, R01 DC004189]",,,30,222,238,3,25,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,22-Jun,2006,441,7096,,,,,984,987,,10.1038/nature04849,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,055AT,WOS:000238422300043,16791196,No,,,11/20/17

This environment is separated into cortical and medullary regions, each containing functionally distinct epithelial populations that are important at successive stages of T-cell development and selection(1,2). However, the developmental origin and lineage relationships between cortical and medullary epithelial cell types remain controversial(3). Here we describe a clonal assay to investigate the developmental potential of single, individually selected, thymic epithelial progenitors ( marked with enhanced yellow fluorescent protein) developing within the normal architecture of the thymus. Using this approach, we show that cortical and medullary epithelial cells share a common origin in bipotent precursors, providing definitive evidence that they have a single rather than dual germ layer origin during embryogenesis. Our findings resolve a long-standing issue in thymus development, and are important in relation to the development of cell-based strategies for thymus disorders and the possibility of restoring function of the atrophied adult thymus.","Univ Birmingham, Sch Med, Inst Biomed Res, Div Immun & Infect,MRC,Ctr Immune Regulat, Birmingham B15 2TT, W Midlands, England","Anderson, G (reprint author), Univ Birmingham, Sch Med, Inst Biomed Res, Div Immun & Infect,MRC,Ctr Immune Regulat, Birmingham B15 2TT, W Midlands, England.",g.anderson@bham.ac.uk,,"Jenkinson, William/0000-0003-3422-8372",Medical Research Council [G0401620],,,23,185,186,0,8,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,22-Jun,2006,441,7096,,,,,988,991,,10.1038/nature04813,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,055AT,WOS:000238422300044,16791197,No,,,11/20/17

Intrathymic T-cell development requires an intact stromal microenvironment, of which thymic epithelial cells (TECs) constitute a major part(1-3). For instance, cell-autonomous genetic defects of forkhead box N1 (Foxn1)(4) and autoimmune regulator (Aire)(5) in thymic epithelial cells cause primary immunodeficiency and autoimmunity, respectively. During development, the thymic epithelial rudiment gives rise to two major compartments, the cortex and medulla. Cortical TECs positively select T cells(6), whereas medullary TECs are involved in negative selection of potentially autoreactive T cells(7). It has long been unclear whether these two morphologically and functionally distinct types of epithelial cells arise from a common bi-potent progenitor cell(8) and whether such progenitors are still present in the postnatal period. Here, using in vivo cell lineage analysis in mice, we demonstrate the presence of a common progenitor of cortical and medullary TECs after birth. To probe the function of postnatal progenitors, a conditional mutant allele of Foxn1 was reverted to wild-type function in single epithelial cells in vivo. This led to the formation of small thymic lobules containing both cortical and medullary areas that supported normal thymopoiesis. Thus, single epithelial progenitor cells can give rise to a complete and functional thymic microenvironment, suggesting that cell-based therapies could be developed for thymus disorders.","Max Planck Inst Immunobiol, Dept Dev Immunol, D-79108 Freiburg, Germany; Univ Freiburg, Dept Pathol, D-79110 Freiburg, Germany; Univ Freiburg, Inst Med Biometry & Informat, D-79104 Freiburg, Germany","Boehm, T (reprint author), Max Planck Inst Immunobiol, Dept Dev Immunol, Stuebeweg 51, D-79108 Freiburg, Germany.",boehm@immunbio.mpg.de,,,,,,29,215,218,0,4,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,22-Jun,2006,441,7096,,,,,992,996,,10.1038/nature04850,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,055AT,WOS:000238422300045,16791198,No,,,11/20/17

Molecules that mediate this conversion should be identifiable in ES cells. One candidate is the variant homeodomain protein Nanog, which has the capacity to entrain undifferentiated ES cell propagation(3,4). Here we report that in fusions between ES cells and neural stem (NS) cells, increased levels of Nanog stimulate pluripotent gene activation from the somatic cell genome and enable an up to 200-fold increase in the recovery of hybrid colonies, all of which show ES cell characteristics. Nanog also improves hybrid yield when thymocytes or fibroblasts are fused to ES cells; however, fewer colonies are obtained than from ES x NS cell fusions, consistent with a hierarchical susceptibility to reprogramming among somatic cell types. Notably, for NS x ES cell fusions elevated Nanog enables primary hybrids to develop into ES cell colonies with identical frequency to homotypic ES x ES fusion products. This means that in hybrids, increased Nanog is sufficient for the NS cell epigenome to be reset completely to a state of pluripotency. We conclude that Nanog can orchestrate ES cell machinery to instate pluripotency with an efficiency of up to 100% depending on the differentiation status of the somatic cell.","Univ Edinburgh, Inst Stem Cell Res, Ctr Dev Stem Cell Biol, Edinburgh EH9 3JQ, Midlothian, Scotland; Univ Cambridge, Inst Stem Cell Biol, Cambridge CB2 1QT, England","Smith, A (reprint author), Univ Edinburgh, Inst Stem Cell Res, Ctr Dev Stem Cell Biol, Edinburgh EH9 3JQ, Midlothian, Scotland.",austin.smith@ed.ac.uk,"Pollard, Steven/B-7966-2010; Chambers, Ian/H-5416-2011; Silva, Jose/G-1920-2014","Pollard, Steven/0000-0001-6428-0492; Chambers, Ian/0000-0003-2605-1597; Silva, Jose/0000-0001-5487-1117; Smith, Austin/0000-0002-3029-4682","Medical Research Council [G0300058, G9806702]; Wellcome Trust",,,28,249,272,1,24,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,22-Jun,2006,441,7096,,,,,997,1001,,10.1038/nature04914,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,055AT,WOS:000238422300046,16791199,No,,,11/20/17

The stable compartments model predicts that each cisterna is a long-lived structure that retains a characteristic set of Golgi-resident proteins. In this view, secretory cargo proteins are transported by vesicles from one cisterna to the next. The cisternal maturation model predicts that each cisterna is a transient structure that matures from early to late by acquiring and then losing specific Golgi-resident proteins. In this view, secretory cargo proteins traverse the Golgi by remaining within the maturing cisternae. Various observations have been interpreted as supporting one or the other mechanism(4-9). Here we provide a direct test of the two models using three-dimensional time-lapse fluorescence microscopy of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. This approach reveals that individual cisternae mature, and do so at a consistent rate. In parallel, we used pulse - chase analysis to measure the transport of two secretory cargo proteins. The rate of cisternal maturation matches the rate of protein transport through the secretory pathway, suggesting that cisternal maturation can account for the kinetics of secretory traffic.","Univ Chicago, Dept Mol Genet & Cell Biol, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; Univ Chicago, Inst Biophys Dynam, Chicago, IL 60637 USA","Glick, BS (reprint author), Univ Chicago, Dept Mol Genet & Cell Biol, 920 E 58th St, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.",bsglick@midway.uchicago.edu,,,,,,31,194,200,6,83,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,22-Jun,2006,441,7096,,,,,1002,1006,,10.1038/nature04717,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,055AT,WOS:000238422300047,16699524,No,,,11/20/17

In the secretory pathway, secretory proteins that are synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum enter the early compartment of the Golgi apparatus called cis cisternae, undergo various modifications and processing, and then leave for the plasma membrane from the late ( trans) cisternae. The cargo proteins must traverse the Golgi apparatus in the cis-totrans direction. Two typical models propose either vesicular transport or cisternal progression and maturation for this process. The vesicular transport model predicts that Golgi cisternae are distinct stable compartments connected by vesicular traffic, whereas the cisternal maturation model predicts that cisternae are transient structures that form de novo, mature from cis to trans, and then dissipate. Technical progress in live-cell imaging has long been awaited to address this problem. Here we show, by the use of high-speed three-dimensional confocal microscopy, that yeast Golgi cisternae do change the distribution of resident membrane proteins from the cis nature to the trans over time, as proposed by the maturation model, in a very dynamic way.","RIKEN, Discovery Res Inst, Mol Membrane Biol Lab, Wako, Saitama 3510198, Japan; Yokogawa Elect Corp, Bioctr, Tokyo 1808750, Japan; Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Sci, Dept Biol Sci, Tokyo 1130033, Japan","Nakano, A (reprint author), RIKEN, Discovery Res Inst, Mol Membrane Biol Lab, Wako, Saitama 3510198, Japan.",nakano@riken.jp,"Nakano, Akihiko/C-6185-2009; Nakano, Akihiko/G-4942-2014; Nakano, Akihiko/A-6420-2016","Nakano, Akihiko/0000-0003-3635-548X; Nakano, Akihiko/0000-0003-3635-548X",,,,24,178,186,1,36,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,22-Jun,2006,441,7096,,,,,1007,1010,,10.1038/nature04737,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,055AT,WOS:000238422300048,16699523,No,,,11/20/17

One possible mechanism by which increased DNA damage could lead to cellular degeneration and death is by stochastic deregulation of gene expression. Here we directly test for increased transcriptional noise in aged tissue by dissociating single cardiomyocytes from fresh heart samples of both young and old mice, followed by global mRNA amplification and quantification of mRNA levels in a panel of housekeeping and heart-specific genes. Although gene expression levels already varied among cardiomyocytes from young heart, this heterogeneity was significantly elevated at old age. We had demonstrated previously an increased load of genome rearrangements and other mutations in the heart of aged mice(3,4). To confirm that increased stochasticity of gene expression could be a result of increased genome damage, we treated mouse embryonic fibroblasts in culture with hydrogen peroxide. Such treatment resulted in a significant increase in cell-to-cell variation in gene expression, which was found to parallel the induction and persistence of genome rearrangement mutations at a lacZ reporter locus. These results underscore the stochastic nature of the ageing process, and could provide a mechanism for age-related cellular degeneration and death in tissues of multicellular organisms.","Buck Inst Age Res, Novato, CA 94945 USA; Univ Munich, Inst Immunol, D-80336 Munich, Germany; Univ Texas, Hlth Sci Ctr, San Antonio, TX 78245 USA; Natl Inst Publ Hlth & Environm, NL-3720 BA Bilthoven, Netherlands","Vijg, J (reprint author), Buck Inst Age Res, Novato, CA 94945 USA.",jvijg@buckinstitute.org,"Rodriguez, Karl/F-2689-2012",,NIA NIH HHS [R36 AG033401],,,19,264,274,1,23,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,22-Jun,2006,441,7096,,,,,1011,1014,,10.1038/nature04844,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,055AT,WOS:000238422300049,16791200,No,,,11/20/17

Germline mutations in SMAD4 are found in over 50% of patients with familial juvenile polyposis, an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by predisposition to hamartomatous polyps and gastrointestinal cancer(5,6). Dense inflammatory cell infiltrates underlay grossly normal appearing, non-polypoid colonic and gastric mucosa of patients with familial juvenile polyposis(7). This prominent stromal component suggests that loss of SMAD4-dependent signalling in cells within the epithelial microenvironment has an important role in the evolution of intestinal tumorigenesis in this syndrome. Here we show that selective loss of Smad4-dependent signalling in T cells leads to spontaneous epithelial cancers throughout the gastrointestinal tract in mice, whereas epithelial-specific deletion of the Smad4 gene does not. Tumours arising within the colon, rectum, duodenum, stomach and oral cavity are stroma-rich with dense plasma cell infiltrates. Smad4(-/-) T cells produce abundant T(H)2-type cytokines including interleukin (IL)-5, IL-6 and IL-13, known mediators of plasma cell and stromal expansion. The results support the concept that cancer, as an outcome, reflects the loss of the normal communication between the cellular constituents of a given organ(8), and indicate that Smad4-deficient T cells ultimately send the wrong message to their stromal and epithelial neighbours.","NCI, Lab Cell Regulat & Carcinogenesis, Ctr Canc Res, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; NIDDKD, Genet Dis & Dev Branch, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; NCI, SAIC, Frederick, MD 21702 USA; NIH, Genet Lab, Ctr Canc Res, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; Indiana Univ, Sch Med, Dept Microbiol & Immunol, Indianapolis, IN 46202 USA","Letterio, JJ (reprint author), NCI, Lab Cell Regulat & Carcinogenesis, Ctr Canc Res, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA.",john.letterio@cwru.edu,"deng, chuxia/N-6713-2016","Mamura, Mizuko/0000-0003-4531-0144",,,,29,197,209,2,18,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,22-Jun,2006,441,7096,,,,,1015,1019,,10.1038/nature04846,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,055AT,WOS:000238422300050,16791201,No,,,11/20/17

Here we model satellite growth and loss as a forming giant planet accumulates gas and rock-ice solids from solar orbit. We find that the mass fraction of its satellite system is regulated to similar to 10(-4) by a balance of two competing processes: the supply of inflowing material to the satellites, and satellite loss through orbital decay driven by the gas.

Bulk protein abundance measurements of >2,500 proteins in rich and minimal media provide a detailed view of the cellular response to these conditions, and capture many changes not observed by DNA microarray analyses. Our single-cell data argue that noise in protein expression is dominated by the stochastic production/destruction of messenger RNAs. Beyond this global trend, there are dramatic protein-specific differences in noise that are strongly correlated with a protein's mode of transcription and its function. For example, proteins that respond to environmental changes are noisy whereas those involved in protein synthesis are quiet.

Repulsive forces separate particles in free space. However, in a structured environment such as a periodic potential and in the absence of dissipation, stable composite objects can exist even for repulsive interactions. Here we report the observation of such an exotic bound state, which comprises a pair of ultracold rubidium atoms in an optical lattice. Consistent with our theoretical analysis, these repulsively bound pairs exhibit long lifetimes, even under conditions when they collide with one another. Signatures of the pairs are also recognized in the characteristic momentum distribution and through spectroscopic measurements. There is no analogue in traditional condensed matter systems of such repulsively bound pairs, owing to the presence of strong decay channels. Our results exemplify the strong correspondence between the optical lattice physics of ultracold bosonic atoms and the Bose-Hubbard model(1,2)-a link that is vital for future applications of these systems to the study of strongly correlated condensed matter and to quantum information.","Univ Innsbruck, Inst Expt Phys, A-6020 Innsbruck, Austria; Univ Innsbruck, Inst Theoret Phys, A-6020 Innsbruck, Austria; Austrian Acad Sci, Inst Quantum Opt & Quantum Informat, A-6020 Innsbruck, Austria","Denschlag, JH (reprint author), Univ Innsbruck, Inst Expt Phys, A-6020 Innsbruck, Austria.",Johannes.Denschlag@uibk.ac.at,"Hecker Denschlag, Johannes/B-6047-2008; Grimm, Rudolf/D-2864-2009; Kantian, Adrian/L-6464-2013; Daley, Andrew/F-5366-2014; Zoller, Peter/O-1639-2014; Thalhammer, Gregor/K-8825-2015","Hecker Denschlag, Johannes/0000-0003-1984-4994; Grimm, Rudolf/0000-0003-1085-5558; Daley, Andrew/0000-0001-9005-7761; Zoller, Peter/0000-0003-4014-1505; Thalhammer, Gregor/0000-0002-3948-8045; Kantian, Adrian/0000-0002-8439-3539",,,,30,320,325,2,22,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,15-Jun,2006,441,7095,,,,,853,856,,10.1038/nature04918,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,052SL,WOS:000238254100037,16778884,No,,,11/20/17

At variance with silica and germania, the non-molecular single-bonded crystalline form of carbon dioxide, phase V, only exists at high pressure(1-9). The amorphous forms of silica (a-SiO2) and germania (a-GeO2) are well known at ambient conditions; however, the amorphous, non-molecular form of CO2 has so far been described only as a result of first-principles simulations(9). Here we report the synthesis of an amorphous, silica-like form of carbon dioxide, a-CO2, which we call 'a-carbonia'. The compression of the molecular phase III of CO2 between 40 and 48 GPa at room temperature initiated the transformation to the non-molecular amorphous phase. Infrared spectra measured at temperatures up to 680 K show the progressive formation of C-O single bonds and the simultaneous disappearance of all molecular signatures. Furthermore, state-of-the-art Raman and synchrotron X-ray diffraction measurements on temperature-quenched samples confirm the amorphous character of the material. Comparison with vibrational and diffraction data for a-SiO2 and a-GeO2, as well as with the structure factor calculated for the a-CO2 sample obtained by first-principles molecular dynamics(9), shows that a-CO2 is structurally homologous to the other group IV dioxide glasses.

In particular, catalytic asymmetric multi-component 'domino' reactions, used during total syntheses of natural products and synthetic building blocks, are highly desirable(2,3). These reactions avoid time-consuming and costly processes, including the purification of intermediates and steps involving the protection and deprotection of functional groups, and they are environmentally friendly and often proceed with excellent stereoselectivities(4,5). Therefore, the design of new catalytic and stereoselective cascade reactions is a continuing challenge at the forefront of synthetic chemistry(6). In addition, catalytic cascade reactions can be described as biomimetic, as they are reminiscent of tandem reactions that may occur during biosyntheses of complex natural products(7,8). Here we report the development of an asymmetric organocatalytic triple cascade reaction for the synthesis of tetra-substituted cyclohexene carbaldehydes. This three-component domino reaction proceeds by way of a catalysed Michael/Michael/aldol condensation sequence affording the products with good to moderate yields (25-58 per cent). During this sequence, four stereogenic centres are formed with high diastereoselectivity and complete enantioselectivity. In addition, variation of the starting materials can be used to obtain diverse polyfunctional cyclohexene derivatives, which can be used as building blocks in organic synthesis.","Rhein Westfal TH Aachen, Inst Organ Chem, D-52074 Aachen, Germany","Enders, D (reprint author), Rhein Westfal TH Aachen, Inst Organ Chem, Landoltweg 1, D-52074 Aachen, Germany.",Enders@RWTH-Aachen.de,,,,,,22,681,682,4,129,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,15-Jun,2006,441,7095,,,,,861,863,,10.1038/nature04820,,3,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,052SL,WOS:000238254100039,16778886,No,,,11/20/17

However, the comparably large growth rate of air traffic requires an improved understanding of the resulting impact of aircraft radiative forcing on climate(2). Contrails have an effect on the Earth's energy balance similar to that of high thin ice clouds(3). Their trapping of outgoing longwave radiation emitted by the Earth and atmosphere (positive radiative forcing) is partly compensated by their reflection of incoming solar radiation (negative radiative forcing). On average, the longwave effect dominates and the net contrail radiative forcing is believed to be positive(1,2,4). Over daily and annual timescales, varying levels of air traffic, meteorological conditions, and solar insolation influence the net forcing effect of contrails. Here we determine the factors most important for contrail climate forcing using a sophisticated radiative transfer model(5,6) for a site in southeast England, located in the entrance to the North Atlantic flight corridor. We find that night-time flights during winter (December to February) are responsible for most of the contrail radiative forcing. Night flights account for only 25 per cent of daily air traffic, but contribute 60 to 80 per cent of the contrail forcing. Further, winter flights account for only 22 per cent of annual air traffic, but contribute half of the annual mean forcing. These results suggest that flight rescheduling could help to minimize the climate impact of aviation.","Univ Reading, Dept Meteorol, Reading RG6 6BB, Berks, England","Stuber, N (reprint author), Univ Reading, Dept Meteorol, Reading RG6 6BB, Berks, England.",n.stuber@reading.ac.uk,"Shine, Keith/D-9093-2012; Forster, Piers/F-9829-2010","Shine, Keith/0000-0003-2672-9978; Forster, Piers/0000-0002-6078-0171",,,,30,49,49,0,11,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,15-Jun,2006,441,7095,,,,,864,867,,10.1038/nature04877,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,052SL,WOS:000238254100040,16778887,No,,,11/20/17

We then used mate preference experiments to show that the phenotype of H. heurippa reproductively isolates it from both parental species. There is strong assortative mating between all three species, and in H. heurippa the wing pattern and colour elements derived from H. melpomene and H. cydno are both critical for mate recognition by males.","Univ Los Andes, Inst Genet, Bogota, Colombia; Smithsonian Trop Res Inst, Panama City, Panama; Univ Edinburgh, Sch Biol Sci, Inst Evolutionary Biol, Edinburgh EH9 3JT, Midlothian, Scotland","Mavarez, J (reprint author), Univ Los Andes, Inst Genet, Carrera 1E 18a-10,POB 4976, Bogota, Colombia.",mavarezj@sl.edu,"Jiggins, Chris/B-9960-2008; Salazar, camilo/A-1647-2010","Jiggins, Chris/0000-0002-7809-062X; Salazar, camilo/0000-0001-9217-6588; Linares, Mauricio/0000-0002-1021-0226",,,,29,230,247,5,131,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,15-Jun,2006,441,7095,,,,,868,871,,10.1038/nature04738,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,052SL,WOS:000238254100041,16778888,No,,,11/20/17

They mate early in adult life and maintain millions of viable sperm in their sperm storage organ until they die many years later(3,4). Because they never re-mate, the reproductive success of queens is ultimately sperm-limited, but it is not known what selective forces determine the upper limit to sperm storage. Here we show that sperm storage carries a significant cost of reduced immunity during colony founding. Newly mated queens of the leaf-cutting ant Atta colombica upregulate their immune response shortly after completing their nest burrow, probably as an adaptive response to a greater exposure to pathogens in the absence of grooming workers. However, the immune response nine days after colony founding is negatively correlated with the amount of sperm in the sperm storage organ, indicating that short-term survival is traded off against long-term reproductive success. The immune response was lower when more males contributed to the stored sperm, indicating that there might be an additional cost of mating or storing genetically different ejaculates.","Inst Biol, Dept Populat Biol, DK-2100 Copenhagen, Denmark","Baer, B (reprint author), Univ Western Australia, Sch Anim Biol MO92, Zool Bldg, Nedlands, WA 6009, Australia.",bcbaer@bi.ku.dk,"Baer, Boris/F-5301-2011; Armitage, Sophie/A-6961-2012; Boomsma, Jacobus/M-2785-2014","Baer, Boris/0000-0002-1136-5967; Armitage, Sophie/0000-0002-5561-9543; Boomsma, Jacobus/0000-0002-3598-1609",,,,26,111,111,3,41,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,15-Jun,2006,441,7095,,,,,872,875,,10.1038/nature04698,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,052SL,WOS:000238254100042,16778889,No,,,11/20/17

In a classic illustration of this 'exploration-exploitation' dilemma(1), a gambler choosing between multiple slot machines balances the desire to select what seems, on the basis of accumulated experience, the richest option, against the desire to choose a less familiar option that might turn out more advantageous ( and thereby provide information for improving future decisions). Far from representing idle curiosity, such exploration is often critical for organisms to discover how best to harvest resources such as food and water. In appetitive choice, substantial experimental evidence, underpinned by computational reinforcement learning(2) (RL) theory, indicates that a dopaminergic(3,4), striatal(5-9) and medial prefrontal network mediates learning to exploit. In contrast, although exploration has been well studied from both theoretical(1) and ethological(10) perspectives, its neural substrates are much less clear. Here we show, in a gambling task, that human subjects' choices can be characterized by a computationally well-regarded strategy for addressing the explore/exploit dilemma. Furthermore, using this characterization to classify decisions as exploratory or exploitative, we employ functional magnetic resonance imaging to show that the frontopolar cortex and intraparietal sulcus are preferentially active during exploratory decisions. In contrast, regions of striatum and ventromedial prefrontal cortex exhibit activity characteristic of an involvement in value-based exploitative decision making. The results suggest a model of action selection under uncertainty that involves switching between exploratory and exploitative behavioural modes, and provide a computationally precise characterization of the contribution of key decision-related brain systems to each of these functions.","UCL, Gatsby Computat Neurosci Unit, London WC1N 3AR, England; UCL, Wellcome Dept Imaging Neurosci, London WC1N 3BG, England","O'Doherty, JP (reprint author), UCL, Gatsby Computat Neurosci Unit, Alexandra House,17 Queen Sq, London WC1N 3AR, England.",jdoherty@hss.caltech.edu,"O'Doherty, John/F-1204-2013","Dolan, Ray/0000-0001-9356-761X; Seymour, Ben/0000-0003-1724-5832","Wellcome Trust [, 078865]",,,30,796,800,12,154,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,15-Jun,2006,441,7095,,,,,876,879,,10.1038/nature04766,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,052SL,WOS:000238254100043,16778890,No,,,11/20/17

However, little is known about the precise roles of autophagy in neurons. Here we report that loss of Atg7 (autophagy-related 7), a gene essential for autophagy, leads to neurodegeneration. We found that mice lacking Atg7 specifically in the central nervous system showed behavioural defects, including abnormal limb-clasping reflexes and a reduction in coordinated movement, and died within 28 weeks of birth. Atg7 deficiency caused massive neuronal loss in the cerebral and cerebellar cortices. Notably, polyubiquitinated proteins accumulated in autophagy-deficient neurons as inclusion bodies, which increased in size and number with ageing. There was, however, no obvious alteration in proteasome function.

Autophagy may have a protective role against the development of a number of neurodegenerative diseases(5-8). Here we report that loss of autophagy causes neurodegeneration even in the absence of any disease-associated mutant proteins. Mice deficient for Atg5 (autophagy-related 5) specifically in neural cells develop progressive deficits in motor function that are accompanied by the accumulation of cytoplasmic inclusion bodies in neurons. In Atg5(-/-) cells, diffuse, abnormal intracellular proteins accumulate, and then form aggregates and inclusions.

The use of IL-2- or IL-2- receptor-deficient mice is problematic owing to their early development of autoimmunity(2-5), attributable to the central role of IL-2 in the generation, maintenance and function of CD4(+) CD25(+) regulatory T cells(6-9). To bypass these inherent difficulties, we have studied the effect of IL-2 on T-cell responses to acute infections by adopting a mixed chimaera strategy in which T cells lacking the high-affinity IL-2 receptor could be studied in an otherwise healthy mouse containing a full complement of regulatory T cells. Here we show that although IL-2 signalling to pathogen-specific CD8(+) T cells affects the number of developing effector and memory cells very little, it is required for the generation of robust secondary responses. This is not due to an altered T-cell-receptor repertoire development or selection, and does not reflect an acute requirement for IL-2 during secondary activation and expansion. Rather, we demonstrate a previously unappreciated role for IL-2 during primary infection in programming the development of CD8(+) memory T cells capable of full secondary expansion.

Two HCMV-encoded immunoevasins, US2 and US11, induce the dislocation of class I MHC heavy chains from the endoplasmic reticulum membrane and target them for proteasomal degradation in the cytosol(2,3). Although the outcome of the dislocation reactions catalysed is similar, US2 and US11 operate differently: Derlin-1 is a key component of the US11 but not the US2 pathway(4). So far, proteins essential for US2-dependent dislocation have not been identified. Here we compare interacting partners of wild-type US2 with those of a dislocation-incompetent US2 mutant, and identify signal peptide peptidase (SPP) as a partner for the active form of US2. We show that a decrease in SPP levels by RNA-mediated interference inhibits heavy-chain dislocation by US2 but not by US11. Our data implicate SPP in the US2 pathway and indicate the possibility of a previously unknown function for this intramembrane-cleaving aspartic protease in dislocation from the endoplasmic reticulum.","Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Pathol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Pathol Funct Proteom Ctr, Boston, MA 02115 USA; Mt Sinai Sch Med, Dept Microbiol, New York, NY 10021 USA","Ploegh, HL (reprint author), Whitehead Inst Biomed Res, 9 Cambridge Ctr, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA.",ploegh@wi.mit.edu,,"Loureiro, Joana/0000-0003-2793-5810; Tortorella, Domenico/0000-0003-0961-3535",,,,30,96,97,0,9,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,15-Jun,2006,441,7095,,,,,894,897,,10.1038/nature04830,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,052SL,WOS:000238254100047,16738546,No,,,11/20/17

Messenger RNA turnover has a major function in regulating gene expression and is responsive to developmental and environmental signals. mRNA decay rates are dictated by cis-acting elements within the mRNA and by trans-acting factors, such as RNA-binding proteins ( reviewed in refs 2, 3). Here we show that beta-catenin stabilizes the mRNA encoding the F-box protein beta TrCP1, and identify the RNA-binding protein CRD-BP ( coding region determinant-binding protein) as a previously unknown target of beta-catenin/Tcf transcription factor. CRD-BP binds to the coding region of bTrCP1 mRNA. Overexpression of CRD-BP stabilizes bTrCP1 mRNA and elevates beta TrCP1 levels ( both in cells and in vivo), resulting in the activation of the Skp1-Cullin1-F-box protein (SCF) beta TrCP E3 ubiquitin ligase and in accelerated turnover of its substrates including I kappa B and beta-catenin. CRD-BP is essential for the induction of both beta TrCP1 and c-Myc by beta-catenin signalling in colorectal cancer cells. High levels of CRD-BP that are found in primary human colorectal tumours exhibiting active beta-catenin/Tcf signalling implicates CRD-BP induction in the upregulation of beta TrCP1, in the activation of dimeric transcription factor NF-kappa B and in the suppression of apoptosis in these cancers.","Univ Wisconsin, Sch Med & Publ Hlth, Dept Dermatol, Madison, WI 53706 USA; Kanazawa Univ, Div Translat & Clin Oncol, Canc Res Inst, Kanazawa, Ishikawa 9200934, Japan; Univ Penn, Dept Anim Biol, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; Univ Wisconsin, Sch Med & Publ Hlth, McArdle Lab Canc Res, Madison, WI 53706 USA","Spiegelman, VS (reprint author), Univ Wisconsin, Sch Med & Publ Hlth, Dept Dermatol, Madison, WI 53706 USA.",spiegelman@dermatology.wisc.edu,,"Liu, Jianghuai/0000-0002-2382-9140",,,,28,109,112,0,3,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,15-Jun,2006,441,7095,,,,,898,901,,10.1038/nature04839,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,052SL,WOS:000238254100048,16778892,No,,,11/20/17

However, many obstacles to interpretation of the fossils are overcome in the SPC because of the broad extent, excellent preservation and morphological variety of its stromatolitic outcrops - which provide comprehensive palaeontological information on a scale exceeding other rocks of such age. Here we present a multi-kilometre-scale palaeontological and palaeoenvironmental study of the SPC, in which we identify seven stromatolite morphotypes - many previously undiscovered - in different parts of a peritidal carbonate platform. We undertake the first morphotype-specific analysis of the structures within their palaeoenvironment and refute contemporary abiogenic hypotheses for their formation.

To explore these characteristics, we have examined the response of a normally oscillating clock in zebrafish to experimental stimuli using in vivo mosaic experiments and mathematical simulation. We demonstrate that the segmentation clock behaves as a coupled oscillator, by showing that Notch-dependent intercellular communication, the activity of which is regulated by the internal hairy oscillator, couples neighbouring cells to facilitate synchronized oscillation. Furthermore, the oscillation phase of individual oscillators fluctuates due to developmental noise such as stochastic gene expression and active cell proliferation. The intercellular coupling was found to have a crucial role in minimizing the effects of this noise to maintain coherent oscillation.","Univ Tokyo, Dept Biol Sci, Grad Sch Sci, Tokyo 1130033, Japan; Nagoya Univ, Div Biol Sci, Grad Sch Sci, Nagoya, Aichi 4648602, Japan","Horikawa, K (reprint author), Univ Tokyo, Dept Biol Sci, Grad Sch Sci, Hongo 7-3-1, Tokyo 1130033, Japan.",kazu@biol.s.u-tokyo.ac.jp; htakeda@biol.s.u-tokyo.ac.jp,"TAKEDA, HIROYUKI/G-4950-2014","Horikawa, Kazuki/0000-0002-9285-4171",,,,44,161,166,0,16,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,8-Jun,2006,441,7094,,,,,719,723,,10.1038/nature04861,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,050NL,WOS:000238095100046,16760970,No,,,11/20/17

These disks may provide insight into the formation and early evolution of terrestrial planets. Previous work on beta Pic concluded that the disk gas has roughly solar abundances of elements(1), but this poses a problem because such gas should rapidly be blown away from the star, contrary to observations showing a stable gas disk in keplerian rotation(1,2). Here we report the detection of singly and doubly ionized carbon ( C II, C III) and neutral atomic oxygen ( O I) gas in the beta Pic disk. Carbon is extremely overabundant relative to every other measured element. This appears to solve the problem of the stable gas disk, because the carbon overabundance should keep the gas disk in keplerian rotation(3).

However, the constitutive equations for dry granular flows, which govern how the material moves under shear, are still a matter of debate(1-10). One difficulty is that grains can behave(11) like a solid ( in a sand pile), a liquid ( when poured from a silo) or a gas ( when strongly agitated). For the two extreme regimes, constitutive equations have been proposed based on kinetic theory for collisional rapid flows(12), and soil mechanics for slow plastic flows(13). However, the intermediate dense regime, where the granular material flows like a liquid, still lacks a unified view and has motivated many studies over the past decade(14). The main characteristics of granular liquids are: a yield criterion ( a critical shear stress below which flow is not possible) and a complex dependence on shear rate when flowing. In this sense, granular matter shares similarities with classical visco-plastic fluids such as Bingham fluids. Here we propose a new constitutive relation for dense granular flows, inspired by this analogy and recent numerical(15,16) and experimental work(17-19). We then test our three-dimensional ( 3D) model through experiments on granular flows on a pile between rough sidewalls, in which a complex 3D flow pattern develops. We show that, without any fitting parameter, the model gives quantitative predictions for the flow shape and velocity profiles. Our results support the idea that a simple visco-plastic approach can quantitatively capture granular flow properties, and could serve as a basic tool for modelling more complex flows in geophysical or industrial applications.","Univ Aix Marseille 1, CNRS, IUSTI, UMR 6595, F-13453 Marseille 13, France","Jop, P (reprint author), Univ Aix Marseille 1, CNRS, IUSTI, UMR 6595, 5 Rue Enrico Fermi, F-13453 Marseille 13, France.",Pierre.Jop@polytech.univ-mrs.fr,"Jop, Pierre/F-1940-2011","Jop, Pierre/0000-0003-3527-2922",,,,30,564,579,17,207,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,8-Jun,2006,441,7094,,,,,727,730,,10.1038/nature04801,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,050NL,WOS:000238095100048,16760972,No,,,11/20/17

Typical acyclic amides are planar. But the amide groups of bicyclic bridgehead lactams(1,2) are highly twisted, and this distortion from planarity can dramatically affect the stability and reactivity of these amides; it also increases the basicity of the nitrogen so that it often behaves more like an amine than a typical planar amide. As a result, the structures and reactivity profiles of these 'anti-Bredt' amides(3) differ significantly from those of planar amides. It is possible that this twisting phenomenon is not exclusive to cyclic systems - non-planarity may also be a critical biological design element that leads to amide ground-state destabilization and alters the reactivity, selectivity and mechanism of various protein and enzymatic processes ( such as amide hydrolysis(1,4-10)). The intriguing qualities of these twisted amides were first recognized in 1938 ( ref. 11), wherein one of the simplest families was introduced - molecules containing the 1-azabicyclo[ 2.2.2]octan-2-one system. But the parent member of this group, 2-quinuclidone ( molecule 1 in this paper), has not yet been unambiguously synthesized. Here, we report the chemical synthesis, isolation and full characterization of the HBF4 salt of 1.

Many studies suggest that static stress changes(2,3) trigger aftershocks, but recent work suggests that shaking ( dynamic stresses) may also play a role(4,5). Here we measure the decay of aftershocks as a function of distance from magnitude 2-6 mainshocks in order to clarify the aftershock triggering process. We find that for short times after the main-shock, when low background seismicity rates allow for good aftershock detection, the decay is well fitted by a single inverse power law over distances of 0.2-50 km. The consistency of the trend indicates that the same triggering mechanism is working over the entire range. As static stress changes at the more distant aftershocks are negligible, this suggests that dynamic stresses may be triggering all of these aftershocks. We infer that the observed aftershock density is consistent with the probability of triggering aftershocks being nearly proportional to seismic wave amplitude. The data are not fitted well by models that combine static stress change with the evolution of frictionally locked faults(3).","US Geol Survey, Pasadena, CA 91106 USA; Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Earth Sci, Santa Cruz, CA 95060 USA","Felzer, KR (reprint author), US Geol Survey, 525 S Wilson, Pasadena, CA 91106 USA.",kfelzer@gps.caltech.edu,"Brodsky, Emily/B-9139-2014","Brodsky, Emily/0000-0002-6855-6860",,,,28,182,185,3,30,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,8-Jun,2006,441,7094,,,,,735,738,,10.1038/nature04799,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,050NL,WOS:000238095100050,16760974,No,,,11/20/17

The fossils, including excellent skull material, come from Kimmeridgian marine beds of northern Germany(6,7), and record more than 11 individuals of sauropods 1.7 to 6.2 m in total body length. Morphological overlap between partial skeletons and isolated bones links all material to the same new taxon. Cortical histology of femora and tibiae indicates that size differences within the specimens are due to different ontogenetic stages, from juveniles to fully grown individuals. The little dinosaurs must have lived on one of the large islands around the Lower Saxony basin(8).

Post-copulatory sexual selection on males ( that is, sperm competition and cryptic female choice) can lead to decreased sperm numbers by favouring the production of larger sperm(1). However, a decline in sperm numbers is predicted to weaken selection on males and increase selection on females(2,3). As isogamy is approached ( that is, as investment per gamete by males approaches that by females), sperm become less abundant, ova become relatively less rare, and competition between males for fertilization success is predicted to weaken. Sexual selection for longer sperm, therefore, is expected to be self limiting. Here we examine this paradox in Drosophila along the anisogamy-isogamy continuum using intraspecific experimental evolution techniques and interspecific comparative techniques. Our results confirm the big-sperm paradox by showing that the sex difference in sexual selection gradients(4) decreases as sperm size increases. However, a resolution to the paradox is provided when this finding is interpreted in concert with the 'opportunity for selection' and the 'opportunity for sexual selection'(5,6). Furthermore, we show that most of the variation in measures of selection intensity is explained by sperm length and relative investment in sperm production.","Syracuse Univ, Dept Biol, Syracuse, NY 13244 USA","Bjork, A (reprint author), Syracuse Univ, Dept Biol, Syracuse, NY 13244 USA.",acbjork@syr.edu,,"Bjork, Adam/0000-0001-7544-2987",,,,29,66,66,4,65,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,8-Jun,2006,441,7094,,,,,742,745,,10.1038/nature04683,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,050NL,WOS:000238095100052,16760976,No,,,11/20/17

Fibroblast growth factors ( FGFs) and other signalling molecules have been shown to guide branch budding and outgrowth(4-7), but it is not known how epithelial cells coordinate their movements and morphogenesis. Here we use genetic mosaic analysis in Drosophila melanogaster to show that there are two functionally distinct classes of cells in budding tracheal branches: cells at the tip that respond directly to Branchless FGF and lead branch outgrowth, and trailing cells that receive a secondary signal to follow the lead cells and form a tube. These roles are not pre-specified; rather, there is competition between cells such that those with the highest FGF receptor activity take the lead positions, whereas those with less FGF receptor activity assume subsidiary positions and form the branch stalk. Competition appears to involve Notch-mediated lateral inhibition that prevents extra cells from assuming the lead. There may also be cooperation between budding cells, because in a mosaic epithelium, cells that cannot respond to the chemoattractant, or respond only poorly, allow other cells in the epithelium to move ahead of them.","Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Dept Biochem, Stanford, CA 94305 USA","Krasnow, MA (reprint author), Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Dept Biochem, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",krasnow@cmgm.stanford.edu,"Ghabrial, Amin/J-4586-2013","Ghabrial, Amin/0000-0002-6160-3003","NIGMS NIH HHS [F32 GM020723, F32 GM020723-03]",,,30,133,135,1,11,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,8-Jun,2006,441,7094,,,,,746,749,,10.1038/nature04829,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,050NL,WOS:000238095100053,16760977,No,,,11/20/17

To understand neural crest evolution, we explored molecular mechanisms underlying craniofacial development in the basal jawless vertebrate, sea lamprey ( Petromyzon marinus), focusing on the SoxE ( Sox8, Sox9 and Sox10) gene family. In jawed vertebrates, these are important transcriptional regulators of the neural crest(3), and the loss of Sox9 causes abnormal craniofacial development(4,5). Here we report that two lamprey SoxE genes are expressed in migrating neural crest and crest-derived prechondrocytes in posterior branchial arches, whereas a third paralogue is expressed later in the perichondrium and mandibular arch. Morpholino knock-down of SoxE1 reveals that it is essential for posterior branchial arch development, although the mandibular arch is unaffected. The results show that chondrogenic function of SoxE regulators can be traced to the lamprey-gnathostome common ancestor and indicate that lamprey SoxE genes might have undergone independent duplication to have distinct functions in mandibular versus caudal branchial arches. This work sheds light on the homology of vertebrate branchial arches and supports their common origin at the base of vertebrates.","CALTECH, Div Biol, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA","McCauley, DW (reprint author), Univ Oklahoma, Dept Zool, Norman, OK 73019 USA.",dwmccauley@ou.edu,,"Bronner, Marianne/0000-0003-4274-1862",,,,24,78,83,0,12,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,8-Jun,2006,441,7094,,,,,750,752,,10.1038/nature04691,,3,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,050NL,WOS:000238095100054,16760978,No,,,11/20/17

Here we address this issue by exploiting the genetic tractability of the fruitfly, Drosophila melanogaster, which exhibits the hallmarks of vertebrate sleep(1-4). We show that large changes in sleep are achieved by spatial and temporal enhancement of cyclic-AMP-dependent protein kinase ( PKA) activity specifically in the adult mushroom bodies of Drosophila.

Propagation of this action potential to the synaptic terminals is widely believed to be the only form of rapid communication of information between the soma and axonal synapses, and hence to postsynaptic neurons. Here we show that the voltage fluctuations associated with dendrosomatic synaptic activity propagate significant distances along the axon, and that modest changes in the somatic membrane potential of the presynaptic neuron modulate the amplitude and duration of axonal action potentials and, through a Ca2+-dependent mechanism, the average amplitude of the postsynaptic potential evoked by these spikes. These results indicate that synaptic activity in the dendrite and soma controls not only the pattern of action potentials generated, but also the amplitude of the synaptic potentials that these action potentials initiate in local cortical circuits, resulting in synaptic transmission that is a mixture of triggered and graded ( analogue) signals.","Yale Univ, Sch Med, Dept Neurobiol, Kavli Inst Neurosci, New Haven, CT 06510 USA","McCormick, DA (reprint author), Yale Univ, Sch Med, Dept Neurobiol, Kavli Inst Neurosci, 333 Cedar St, New Haven, CT 06510 USA.",david.mccormick@yale.edu,"Kobelt, Liza/F-5926-2011",,,,,31,220,227,0,10,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,8-Jun,2006,441,7094,,,,,761,765,,10.1038/nature04720,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,050NL,WOS:000238095100057,16625207,No,,,11/20/17

In most animals, segregation of the germ line from the somatic lineages is one of the earliest events in development(2); in avian embryos, PGCs are first identified in an extra-embryonic region, the germinal crescent, after approximately 18 h of incubation. After 50-55 h of development, PGCs migrate to the gonad and subsequently produce functional sperm and oocytes(3,4). So far, cultures of PGCs that remain restricted to the germ line have not been reported in any species(5,6). Here we show that chicken PGCs can be isolated, cultured and genetically modified while maintaining their commitment to the germline. Furthermore, we show that chicken PGCs can be induced in vitro to differentiate into embryonic germ cells that contribute to somatic tissues. Retention of the commitment of PGCs to the germ line after extended periods in culture and after genetic modification combined with their capacity to acquire somatic competence in vitro provides a new model for developmental biology. The utility of the model is enhanced by the accessibility of the avian embryo, which facilitates access to the earliest stages of development and supplies a facile route for the reintroduction of PGCs into the embryonic vasculature. In addition, these attributes create new opportunities to manipulate the genome of chickens for agricultural and pharmaceutical applications.","Origen Therapeut, Burlingame, CA 94010 USA; Univ Calif Davis, Dept Anim Sci, Davis, CA 95616 USA","Etches, RJ (reprint author), Origen Therapeut, 1450 Rollins Rd, Burlingame, CA 94010 USA.",retches@origentherapeutics.com,,"Swanberg, Susan/0000-0001-7487-7065",,,,22,200,215,1,26,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,8-Jun,2006,441,7094,,,,,766,769,,10.1038/nature04831,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,050NL,WOS:000238095100058,16760981,No,,,11/20/17

Tethering reporter genes to the nuclear envelope alone can impose repression(2) and recent reports have shown that, after activation, certain genes can also be found closer to the nuclear periphery(3-6). The molecular mechanisms underlying these phenomena have remained elusive. Here, with the use of dynamic three-dimensional tracking of a single locus in live yeast ( Saccharomyces cerevisiae) cells, we show that the activation of GAL genes ( GAL7, GAL10 and GAL1) leads to a confinement in dynamic motility. We demonstrate that the GAL locus is subject to sub-diffusive movement, which after activation can become constrained to a two-dimensional sliding motion along the nuclear envelope. RNA-fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis after activation reveals a higher transcriptional activity for the peripherally constrained GAL genes than for loci remaining intranuclear. This confinement was mediated by Sus1 and Ada2, members of the SAGA histone acetyltransferase complex, and Sac3, a messenger RNA export factor, physically linking the activated GAL genes to the nuclear-pore-complex component Nup1. Deleting ADA2 or NUP1 abrogates perinuclear GAL confinement without affecting GAL1 transcription. Accordingly, transcriptional activation is necessary but not sufficient for the confinement of GAL genes at the nuclear periphery. The observed real-time dynamic mooring of active GAL genes to the inner side of the nuclear pore complex is in accordance with the 'gene gating' hypothesis(7).","Inst Pasteur Korea, Seoul 136791, South Korea; Inst Pasteur, Unite Biol Cellulaire Noyau, F-75724 Paris 15, France; Inst Pasteur, Unite Anal Images Quantitat, F-75724 Paris 15, France; Inst Pasteur, Dept Biol Cellulaire & Infect, F-75724 Paris 15, France; Univ Heidelberg BZH, Zentrum Biochem, D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany; Lab Phys Theor Mat Condensee, F-75252 Paris 05, France","Nehrbass, U (reprint author), Inst Pasteur Korea, 39-1 Hawolgok Dong, Seoul 136791, South Korea.",jcolivo@pasteur.fr; cg5@ix.urz.uni-heidelberg.de; nehrbass@pasteur.fr,"Rodriguez-Navarro, Susana/B-5182-2014; Auguste, GENOVESIO/I-1656-2017; Gadal, Olivier/A-4731-2008","Rodriguez-Navarro, Susana/0000-0001-7472-3111; Gadal, Olivier/0000-0001-9421-0831; Cabal, Ghislain/0000-0002-9728-506X; feuerbach, frank/0000-0002-8631-5120; Genovesio, Auguste/0000-0003-1877-5595",,,,20,285,294,0,15,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,8-Jun,2006,441,7094,,,,,770,773,,10.1038/nature04752,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,050NL,WOS:000238095100059,16760982,No,,,11/20/17

In budding yeast, regions of silent chromatin, such as those at telomeres and mating-type loci, cluster at the nuclear envelope creating zones that favour gene repression(1,2). Other reports indicate that gene transcription occurs at the nuclear periphery, apparently owing to association of the gene with nuclear pore complexes(3-5). Here we report that transcriptional activation of a subtelomeric gene, HXK1 ( hexokinase isoenzyme 1), by growth on a non-glucose carbon source led to its relocalization to nuclear pores. This relocation required the 30 untranslated region ( UTR), which is essential for efficient messenger RNA processing and export, consistent with an accompanying report(6). However, activation of HXK1 by an alternative pathway based on the transactivator VP16 moved the locus away from the nuclear periphery and abrogated the normal induction of HXK1 by galactose. Notably, when we interfered with HXK1 localization by either antagonizing or promoting association with the pore, transcript levels were reduced or enhanced, respectively. From this we conclude that nuclear position has an active role in determining optimal gene expression levels.","Friedrich Miescher Inst Biomed Res, CH-4058 Basel, Switzerland; Inst Curie, CNRS, Sect Rech, UMR 218, F-75231 Paris 05, France; Univ Geneva, NCCR Frontiers Genet, CH-1211 Geneva 4, Switzerland","Gasser, SM (reprint author), Friedrich Miescher Inst Biomed Res, Maulbeerstr 66, CH-4058 Basel, Switzerland.",susan.gasser@fmi.ch,,"Cubizolles, Fabien/0000-0002-9822-4074",,,,27,251,256,1,12,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,8-Jun,2006,441,7094,,,,,774,778,,10.1038/nature04845,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,050NL,WOS:000238095100060,16760983,No,,,11/20/17

Here we propose a brainstem flip - flop switch, consisting of mutually inhibitory REM-off and REM-on areas in the mesopontine tegmentum. Each side contains GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid)- ergic neurons that heavily innervate the other. The REM- on area also contains two populations of glutamatergic neurons.

Here we report that two genes, DSCR1 and DYRK1A, lie within the critical region of human chromosome 21 and act synergistically to prevent nuclear occupancy of NFATc transcription factors, which are regulators of vertebrate development. We use mathematical modelling to predict that autoregulation within the pathway accentuates the effects of trisomy of DSCR1 and DYRK1A, leading to failure to activate NFATc target genes under specific conditions. Our observations of calcineurin- and Nfatc-deficient mice, Dscr1- and Dyrk1a-overexpressing mice, mouse models of Down's syndrome and human trisomy 21 are consistent with these predictions. We suggest that the 1.5-fold increase in dosage of DSCR1 and DYRK1A cooperatively destabilizes a regulatory circuit, leading to reduced NFATc activity and many of the features of Down's syndrome. More generally, these observations suggest that the destabilization of regulatory circuits can underlie human disease.","Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Dept Pathol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Program Immunol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Dept Med, Div Cardiovasc Med, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Dept Dev Biol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Dept Genet, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Med, HMRO, Genet Engn & Funct Genom Unit, Kyoto 6068501, Japan","Crabtree, GR (reprint author), Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Dept Pathol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",igraef@stanford.edu; crabtree@stanford.edu,"Miyakawa, Tsuyoshi/A-7741-2008","Miyakawa, Tsuyoshi/0000-0003-0137-8200",Medical Research Council [MC_U120097116],,,42,389,399,1,26,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,1-Jun,2006,441,7093,,,,,595,600,,10.1038/nature04678,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,048AU,WOS:000237920800038,16554754,No,,,11/20/17

Here we present a Cenozoic palaeoceanographic record constructed from >400 m of sediment core from a recent drilling expedition to the Lomonosov ridge in the Arctic Ocean. Our record shows a palaeoenvironmental transition from a warm 'greenhouse' world, during the late Palaeocene and early Eocene epochs, to a colder 'icehouse' world influenced by sea ice and icebergs from the middle Eocene epoch to the present. For the most recent similar to 14 Myr, we find sedimentation rates of 1 - 2 cm per thousand years, in stark contrast to the substantially lower rates proposed in earlier studies; this record of the Neogene reveals cooling of the Arctic that was synchronous with the expansion of Greenland ice (similar to 3.2 Myr ago) and East Antarctic ice (similar to 14 Myr ago). We find evidence for the first occurrence of ice-rafted debris in the middle Eocene epoch (similar to 45 Myr ago), some 35 Myr earlier than previously thought; fresh surface waters were present at,49 Myr ago, before the onset of ice-rafted debris. Also, the temperatures of surface waters during the Palaeocene/Eocene thermal maximum (similar to 55 Myr ago) appear to have been substantially warmer than previously estimated. The revised timing of the earliest Arctic cooling events coincides with those from Antarctica, supporting arguments for bipolar symmetry in climate change.","Univ Rhode Isl, Grad Sch Oceanog, Narragansett, RI 02882 USA; Univ Rhode Isl, Dept Ocean Engn, Narragansett, RI 02882 USA; Stockholm Univ, Dept Geol & Geochem, SE-10691 Stockholm, Sweden; Univ Utrecht, Dept Biol, Palaeobot & Palynol Lab, NL-3584 DC Utrecht, Netherlands; Brown Univ, Dept Geol Sci, Providence, RI 02912 USA; US Geol Survey, Reston, VA 20192 USA; Rice Univ, Dept Earth Sci, Houston, TX 77251 USA; Univ Bordeaux, Dept Geol & Oceanog, F-33405 Talence, France; CNRS, CEREGE, Dept Geophys, F-13545 Aix En Provence, France; Yamagata Univ, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, Yamagata 9908560, Japan; UCL, Dept Earth Sci, London WC1E 6BT, England; Norwegian Polar Res Inst, Polar Environm Ctr, N-9296 Tromso, Norway; VNIIOkeangeol, Dept Lithol & Geochem, St Petersburg 190121, Russia; Boston Univ, Boston, MA 02215 USA; Alfred Wegener Inst Fdn Polar & Marine Res, D-27515 Bremerhaven, Germany; British Geol Survey, Edinburgh EH9 3LA, Midlothian, Scotland; Univ Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; Kyushu Univ, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, Fukuoka 8128581, Japan; Univ Southampton, Natl Oceanog Ctr, Southampton SO14 3ZH, Hants, England; Univ Aberdeen, Dept Geog & Environm, Aberdeen AB24 3UF, Scotland; Univ Padua, Dept Geol Paleontol & Geophys, I-35137 Padua, Italy; JAMSTEC, IFREE, Yokosuka, Kanagawa 2370061, Japan; James Madison Univ, Dept Geol & Environm Sci, Harrisonburg, VA 22807 USA; Nagoya Univ, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, Nagoya, Aichi 4648602, Japan; Tohoku Univ, Inst Geol & Palaeontol, Sendai, Miyagi 9808578, Japan; Geol Survey Japan, Inst Geosci, Ibaraki 3058567, Japan; Hokkaido Univ, Grad Sch Environm Earth Sci, Sapporo, Hokkaido 0600810, Japan; IFM GEOMAR, Leibniz Inst Marine Sci, D-24148 Kiel, Germany; ETH, Paul Scherrer Inst, CH-8093 Zurich, Switzerland; Univ Bergen, Dept Earth Sci, N-5007 Bergen, Norway","Moran, K (reprint author), Univ Rhode Isl, Grad Sch Oceanog, Narragansett, RI 02882 USA.",kate.moran@gso.uri.edu,"; Palike, Heiko/A-6560-2008; O'Regan, Matt/B-2157-2010; Jakobsson, Martin/F-6214-2010; Brinkhuis, Henk/B-4223-2009; Dickens, Gerald/G-1222-2011; Kaminski, Michael/K-3334-2012; Smith, David/A-8309-2013; U-ID, Kyushu/C-5291-2016; Moore, Theodore/N-8848-2014; Yamamoto, Masanobu/A-6990-2012","Eynaud, Frederique/0000-0003-1283-7425; Jakobsson, Martin/0000-0002-9033-3559; Jokat, Wilfried/0000-0002-7793-5854; Stein, Ruediger/0000-0002-4453-9564; O'Regan, Matt/0000-0002-6046-1488; Onodera, Jonaotaro/0000-0001-6942-2285; Palike, Heiko/0000-0003-3386-0923; Matthiessen, Jens/0000-0002-6952-2494; Smith, David/0000-0003-0627-5788; Moore, Theodore/0000-0003-4121-1325; Yamamoto, Masanobu/0000-0003-1312-825X; Jordan, Richard/0000-0002-8997-7349; Krylov, Alexey/0000-0001-5539-9758",,,,42,307,327,2,97,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,1-Jun,2006,441,7093,,,,,601,605,,10.1038/nature04800,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,048AU,WOS:000237920800039,16738653,No,,,11/20/17

Little field evidence, however, has been available to constrain oceanic conditions in the Arctic during this period. Here we analyse Palaeogene sediments obtained during the Arctic Coring Expedition, showing that large quantities of the free-floating fern Azolla grew and reproduced in the Arctic Ocean by the onset of the middle Eocene epoch (similar to 50 Myr ago). The Azolla and accompanying abundant freshwater organic and siliceous microfossils indicate an episodic freshening of Arctic surface waters during an similar to 800,000-year interval. The abundant remains of Azolla that characterize basal middle Eocene marine deposits of all Nordic seas(4-7) probably represent transported assemblages resulting from freshwater spills from the Arctic Ocean that reached as far south as the North Sea(8). The termination of the Azolla phase in the Arctic coincides with a local sea surface temperature rise from similar to 10 degrees C to 13 degrees C, pointing to simultaneous increases in salt and heat supply owing to the influx of waters from adjacent oceans. We suggest that onset and termination of the Azolla phase depended on the degree of oceanic exchange between Arctic Ocean and adjacent seas.","Univ Utrecht, Palaeobot & Palynol Lab, Inst Environm Biol, NL-3584 CD Utrecht, Netherlands; Royal Netherlands Inst Sea Res NIOZ, Dept Marine Biogeochem & Toxicol, NL-1790 AB Den Burg, Netherlands; Univ London, Royal Holloway & Bedford New Coll, Dept Geol, Egham TW20 0EX, Surrey, England; Univ Utrecht, Dept Earth Sci, NL-3584 CD Utrecht, Netherlands; Rice Univ, Dept Earth Sci, Houston, TX 77005 USA; Purdue Univ, Dept Earth & Atmospher Sci, W Lafayette, IN 47906 USA; Purdue Univ, Purdue Climate Change Res Ctr, W Lafayette, IN 47906 USA; US Geol Survey, Natl Ctr, Reston, VA 20192 USA; Kyushu Univ, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, Fukuoka 8128581, Japan; Bujak Res Inst, Blackpool FY3 8NE, England; Alfred Wegener Inst Polar & Marine Res, D-27568 Bremerhaven, Germany; Shell UK Explorat & Prod Ltd, Aberdeen AB12 3FY, Scotland; Univ Southampton, Southampton Oceanog Ctr, Sch Ocean & Earth Sci, Southampton SO14 3ZH, Hants, England; Natl Museum Nat Hist, NL-2300 RA Leiden, Netherlands; Stockholm Univ, Dept Geol & Geochem, SE-10691 Stockholm, Sweden; Univ Rhode Isl, Narragansett, RI 02882 USA","Brinkhuis, H (reprint author), Univ Utrecht, Palaeobot & Palynol Lab, Inst Environm Biol, Budapestlaan 4, NL-3584 CD Utrecht, Netherlands.",H.Brinkhuis@bio.uu.nl,"; Palike, Heiko/A-6560-2008; Sinninghe Damste, Jaap/F-6128-2011; U-ID, Kyushu/C-5291-2016; Sluijs, Appy/B-3726-2009; Huber, Matthew/A-7677-2008; Lotter, Andre/C-3477-2008; O'Regan, Matt/B-2157-2010; Jakobsson, Martin/F-6214-2010; Brinkhuis, Henk/B-4223-2009; de Leeuw, Jan/F-6471-2011; Dickens, Gerald/G-1222-2011; Harding, Ian/K-3320-2012","Matthiessen, Jens/0000-0002-6952-2494; Eynaud, Frederique/0000-0003-1283-7425; Jakobsson, Martin/0000-0002-9033-3559; Stein, Ruediger/0000-0002-4453-9564; O'Regan, Matt/0000-0002-6046-1488; Onodera, Jonaotaro/0000-0001-6942-2285; Palike, Heiko/0000-0003-3386-0923; Sinninghe Damste, Jaap/0000-0002-8683-1854; Sluijs, Appy/0000-0003-2382-0215; Huber, Matthew/0000-0002-2771-9977; Lotter, Andre/0000-0002-2954-8809; ",Intramural NIH HHS,,,28,168,170,4,58,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,1-Jun,2006,441,7093,,,,,606,609,,10.1038/nature04692,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,048AU,WOS:000237920800040,16752440,No,,,11/20/17

Although aspects of the resulting environmental changes are well documented at low latitudes, no data were available to quantify simultaneous changes in the Arctic region. Here we identify the Palaeocene/Eocene thermal maximum in a marine sedimentary sequence obtained during the Arctic Coring Expedition(5). We show that sea surface temperatures near the North Pole increased from similar to 18 degrees C to over 23 degrees C during this event. Such warm values imply the absence of ice and thus exclude the influence of ice-albedo feedbacks on this Arctic warming. At the same time, sea level rose while anoxic and euxinic conditions developed in the ocean's bottom waters and photic zone, respectively. Increasing temperature and sea level match expectations based on palaeoclimate model simulations(6), but the absolute polar temperatures that we derive before, during and after the event are more than 10 degrees C warmer than those model-predicted. This suggests that higher-than-modern greenhouse gas concentrations must have operated in conjunction with other feedback mechanisms - perhaps polar stratospheric clouds(7) or hurricane-induced ocean mixing(8) - to amplify early Palaeogene polar temperatures.","Univ Utrecht, Palaeobot & Palynol Lab, Inst Environm Biol, NL-3584 CD Utrecht, Netherlands; Royal Netherlands Inst Sea Res NIOZ, Dept Marine Biogeochem & Toxicol, NL-1790 AB Den Burg, Texel, Netherlands; Yale Univ, Dept Geol & Geophys, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; Univ Utrecht, Dept Earth Sci, NL-3584 CD Utrecht, Netherlands; Rice Univ, Dept Earth Sci, Houston, TX 77005 USA; Purdue Univ, Dept Earth & Atmospher Sci, W Lafayette, IN 47906 USA; Purdue Univ, Purdue Climate Change Res Ctr, W Lafayette, IN 47906 USA; Alfred Wegener Inst Polar & Marine Res, D-27568 Bremerhaven, Germany; Stockholm Univ, Dept Geol & Geochem, SE-10691 Stockholm, Sweden; Univ Rhode Isl, Narragansett, RI 02882 USA","Sluijs, A (reprint author), Univ Utrecht, Palaeobot & Palynol Lab, Inst Environm Biol, Budapestlaan 4, NL-3584 CD Utrecht, Netherlands.",a.sluijs@bio.uu.nl; schouten@nioz.nl,"; Palike, Heiko/A-6560-2008; Huber, Matthew/A-7677-2008; Pagani, Mark/B-3233-2008; O'Regan, Matt/B-2157-2010; Jakobsson, Martin/F-6214-2010; Pedentchouk, Nikolai/C-9935-2011; Brinkhuis, Henk/B-4223-2009; Dickens, Gerald/G-1222-2011; Sinninghe Damste, Jaap/F-6128-2011; Sluijs, Appy/B-3726-2009","Eynaud, Frederique/0000-0003-1283-7425; Jakobsson, Martin/0000-0002-9033-3559; Stein, Ruediger/0000-0002-4453-9564; O'Regan, Matt/0000-0002-6046-1488; Onodera, Jonaotaro/0000-0001-6942-2285; Palike, Heiko/0000-0003-3386-0923; Huber, Matthew/0000-0002-2771-9977; Sinninghe Damste, Jaap/0000-0002-8683-1854; Sluijs, Appy/0000-0003-2382-0215; Pedentchouk, Nikolai/0000-0002-2923-966X; Matthiessen, Jens/0000-0002-6952-2494",,,,29,346,362,2,107,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,1-Jun,2006,441,7093,,,,,610,613,,10.1038/nature04668,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,048AU,WOS:000237920800041,16752441,No,,,11/20/17

Its south polar region consists of young, tectonically deformed terrain and has an anomalously high heat flux(1,2). This heat flux is probably due to localized tidal dissipation within either the ice shell(3) or the underlying silicate core(4). The surface deformation is plausibly due to upwelling of low-density material (diapirism(5)) as a result of this tidal heating. Here we show that the current polar location of the hotspot can be explained by reorientation of the satellite's rotation axis because of the presence of a low-density diapir. If the diapir is in the ice shell, then the shell must be relatively thick and maintain significant rigidity (elastic thickness greater than similar to 0.5 km); if the diapir is in the silicate core, then Enceladus cannot possess a global subsurface ocean, because the core must be coupled to the overlying ice for reorientation to occur. The reorientation generates large (similar to 10 MPa) tectonic stress patterns(6) that are compatible with the observed deformation of the south polar region(2). We predict that the distribution of impact craters on the surface will not show the usual leading hemisphere trailing hemisphere asymmetry. A low-density diapir also yields a potentially observable negative gravity anomaly.","Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Earth Sci, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA; Univ Colorado, Atmospher & Space Phys Lab, Boulder, CO 80309 USA","Nimmo, F (reprint author), Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Earth Sci, 1156 High St, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA.",fnimmo@es.ucsc.edu,,"Nimmo, Francis/0000-0003-3573-5915",,,,30,70,70,4,13,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,1-Jun,2006,441,7093,,,,,614,616,,10.1038/nature04821,,3,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,048AU,WOS:000237920800042,16738654,No,,,11/20/17

On the molecular level, chirality often has a profound impact on recognition and interaction events and is thus important to biochemistry and pharmacology. In chemical synthesis, much effort has been directed towards developing asymmetric synthesis strategies that yield product molecules with a significant excess of either the left-handed or right-handed enantiomer. This is usually achieved by making use of chiral auxiliaries or catalysts that influence the course of a reaction, with the enantiomeric excess (ee) of the product linearly related to the ee of the auxiliary or catalyst used. In recent years, however, an increasing number of asymmetric reactions have been documented where this relationship is nonlinear(1), an effect that can lead to asymmetric amplification. Theoretical models(2,3) have long suggested that autocatalytic processes can result in kinetically controlled asymmetric amplification, a prediction that has now been verified experimentally(4-6) and rationalized mechanistically(7-14) for an autocatalytic alkylation reaction. Here we show an alternative mechanism that gives rise to asymmetric amplification based on the equilibrium solid-liquid phase behaviour of amino acids in solution. This amplification mechanismis robust and can operate in aqueous systems, making it an appealing proposition for explaining one of the most tantalizing examples of asymmetric amplification - the development of high enantiomeric excess in biomolecules from a presumably racemic prebiotic world.","Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Dept Chem, London SW7 2AZ, England; Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Dept Chem Engn & Chem Technol, London SW7 2AZ, England","Blackmond, DG (reprint author), Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Dept Chem, London SW7 2AZ, England.",d.blackmond@imperial.ac.uk,,"Klussmann, Martin/0000-0002-9026-205X",,,,30,247,252,9,119,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,1-Jun,2006,441,7093,,,,,621,623,,10.1038/nature04780,,3,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,048AU,WOS:000237920800044,16738656,No,,,11/20/17

The latter artefacts, dated to between 95 - 74 and 12 kyr ago(8,9), are associated with the remains of a dwarfed descendent of S. florensis, Komodo dragon, rat and a small-bodied hominin species, Homo floresiensis, which had a brain size of about 400 cubic centimetres(10,11).

Although biodiversity is now known to affect ecosystem productivity(1-6), its effects on stability are debated(6-13). Here we present a long-term experimental field test of the diversity - stability hypothesis. During a decade of data collection in an experiment that directly controlled the number of perennial prairie species(4), growing-season climate varied considerably, causing year-to-year variation in abundances of plant species and in ecosystem productivity. We found that greater numbers of plant species led to greater temporal stability of ecosystem annual aboveground plant production. In particular, the decadal temporal stability of the ecosystem, whether measured with intervals of two, five or ten years, was significantly greater at higher plant diversity and tended to increase as plots matured. Ecosystem stability was also positively dependent on root mass, which is a measure of perenniating biomass. Temporal stability of the ecosystem increased with diversity, despite a lower temporal stability of individual species, because of both portfolio ( statistical averaging) and overyielding effects. However, we found no evidence of a covariance effect. Our results indicate that the reliable, efficient and sustainable supply of some foods ( for example, livestock fodder), biofuels and ecosystem services can be enhanced by the use of biodiversity.","Univ Minnesota, Dept Ecol Evolut & Behav, St Paul, MN 55108 USA; Univ Minnesota, Dept Forest Resources, St Paul, MN 55108 USA; Univ Nebraska, Sch Biol Sci, Lincoln, NE 68588 USA","Tilman, D (reprint author), Univ Minnesota, Dept Ecol Evolut & Behav, 1987 Upper Buford Circle, St Paul, MN 55108 USA.",tilman@umn.edu,,,,,,29,656,762,43,841,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,1-Jun,2006,441,7093,,,,,629,632,,10.1038/nature04742,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,048AU,WOS:000237920800046,16738658,No,,,11/20/17

Of the processes capable of maintaining variation, negative frequency-dependent selection ( where rare types are favoured by selection) is the most powerful, at least in theory(1); however, few experimental studies have confirmed that this process operates in nature. One of the most extreme, unexplained genetic polymorphisms is seen in the colour patterns of male guppies ( Poecilia reticulata)(4,5). Here we manipulated the frequencies of males with different colour patterns in three natural populations to estimate survival rates, and found that rare phenotypes had a highly significant survival advantage compared to common phenotypes. Evidence from humans(6,7) and other species(8,9) implicates frequency-dependent survival in the maintenance of molecular, morphological and health-related polymorphisms.

An example is the type III secretion machine, which mediates the transfer of bacterial virulence proteins into host cells(1). A central component of this nanomachine is the needle complex or injectisome, an organelle associated with the bacterial envelope that is composed of a multi-ring base, an inner rod, and a protruding needle(2). Assembly of this organelle proceeds in sequential steps that require the reprogramming of the secretion machine. Here we provide evidence that, in Salmonella typhimurium, completion of the assembly of the inner rod determines the size of the needle substructure.

In the process, viral complementary DNA traverses the nuclear envelope to integrate within chromatin(2). Given the intimate association between chromatin and the nuclear envelope(3), we examined whether HIV-1 appropriates nuclear envelope components during infection. Here we show that emerin, an integral inner-nuclear-envelope protein, is necessary for HIV-1 infection. Infection of primary macrophages lacking emerin was abortive in that viral cDNA localized to the nucleus but integration into chromatin was inefficient, and conversion of viral cDNA to non-functional episomal cDNA increased. HIV-1 cDNA associated with emerin in vivo, and the interaction of viral cDNA with chromatin was dependent on emerin. Barrier-to-autointegration factor (BAF), the LEM ( LAP, emerin, MAN) binding partner of emerin, was required for the association of viral cDNA with emerin and for the ability of emerin to support virus infection. Therefore emerin, which bridges the interface between the inner nuclear envelope and chromatin, may be necessary for chromatin engagement by viral cDNA before integration.","Univ Massachusetts, Sch Med, Program Mol Med, Worcester, MA 01605 USA","Stevenson, M (reprint author), Univ Massachusetts, Sch Med, Program Mol Med, 373 Plantat St,Suite 319, Worcester, MA 01605 USA.",mario.stevenson@umassmed.edu,"Jacque, Jean-Marc/B-6875-2008",,,,,27,72,86,1,9,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,1-Jun,2006,441,7093,,,,,641,645,,10.1038/nature04682,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,048AU,WOS:000237920800049,16680152,No,,,11/20/17

In resting cells, NFAT proteins are heavily phosphorylated and reside in the cytoplasm; in cells exposed to stimuli that raise intracellular free Ca2+ levels, they are dephosphorylated by the calmodulin-dependent phosphatase calcineurin and translocate to the nucleus(1). NFAT dephosphorylation by calcineurin is countered by distinct NFAT kinases, among them casein kinase 1 (CK1) and glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3)(1-5). Here we have used a genome-wide RNA interference ( RNAi) screen in Drosophila(6,7) to identify additional regulators of the signalling pathway leading from Ca2+- calcineurin to NFAT. This screen was successful because the pathways regulating NFAT subcellular localization (Ca2+ influx, Ca2+ - calmodulin calcineurin signalling and NFAT kinases) are conserved across species(8,9), even though Ca2+-regulated NFAT proteins are not themselves represented in invertebrates. Using the screen, we have identified DYRKs (dual-specificity tyrosine-phosphorylation regulated kinases) as novel regulators of NFAT. DYRK1A and DYRK2 counter calcineurin-mediated dephosphorylation of NFAT1 by directly phosphorylating the conserved serine-proline repeat 3 (SP-3) motif of the NFAT regulatory domain, thus priming further phosphorylation of the SP-2 and serine-rich region 1 (SRR1) motifs by GSK3 and CK1, respectively. Thus, genetic screening in Drosophila can be successfully applied to cross evolutionary boundaries and identify new regulators of a transcription factor that is expressed only in vertebrates.","Harvard Univ, Sch Med, CBR Inst Biomed Res, Boston, MA 02115 USA; Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Pathol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Pediat, Boston, MA 02115 USA","Rao, AJ (reprint author), Harvard Univ, Sch Med, CBR Inst Biomed Res, 200 Longwood Ave, Boston, MA 02115 USA.",arao@cbr.med.harvard.edu,,"Feske, Stefan/0000-0001-5431-8178",,,,30,234,248,2,15,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,1-Jun,2006,441,7093,,,,,646,650,,10.1038/nature04631,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,048AU,WOS:000237920800050,16511445,No,,,11/20/17

Along this pathway, multiple preribosomal particles are generated, which transiently associate with numerous non-ribosomal factors before mature 60S and 40S subunits are formed(5-12). However, most mechanistic details of ribosome biogenesis are still unknown. Here we identify a maturation step of the yeast pre-40S subunit that is regulated by the protein kinase Hrr25 and involves ribosomal protein Rps3. A high salt concentration releases Rps3 from isolated pre-40S particles but not from mature 40S subunits. Electron microscopy indicates that pre-40S particles lack a structural landmark present in mature 40S subunits, the 'beak'. The beak is formed by the protrusion of 18S ribosomal RNA helix 33, which is in close vicinity to Rps3. Two protein kinases Hrr25 and Rio2 are associated with pre-40S particles. Hrr25 phosphorylates Rps3 and the 40S synthesis factor Enp1. Phosphorylated Rsp3 and Enp1 readily dissociate from the pre-ribosome, whereas subsequent dephosphorylation induces formation of the beak structure and salt-resistant integration of Rps3 into the 40S subunit. In vivo depletion of Hrr25 inhibits growth and leads to the accumulation of immature 40S subunits that contain unstably bound Rps3. We conclude that the kinase activity of Hrr25 regulates the maturation of 40S ribosomal subunits.","Univ Heidelberg, Zentrum Biochem, D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany; Univ Basel, ME Muller Inst Struct Biol, Biozentrum, CH-4056 Basel, Switzerland; Univ Edinburgh, Wellcome Trust Ctr Cell Biol, Edinburgh EH9 3JR, Midlothian, Scotland; European Mol Biol Lab, D-69117 Heidelberg, Germany","Hurt, E (reprint author), Univ Heidelberg, Zentrum Biochem, Neuenheimer Feld 328, D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany.",cg5@ix.urz.uni-heidelberg.de,"Bottcher, Bettina/E-9397-2010","Bottcher, Bettina/0000-0002-7962-4849",Wellcome Trust,,,27,117,120,0,9,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,1-Jun,2006,441,7093,,,,,651,655,,10.1038/nature04840,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,048AU,WOS:000237920800051,16738661,No,,,11/20/17

Here we describe the computational redesign of the cleavage specificity of the intron-encoded homing endonuclease I-MsoI(7) using a physically realistic atomic-level forcefield(8,9). Using an in silico screen, we identified single base-pair substitutions predicted to disrupt binding by the wild-type enzyme, and then optimized the identities and conformations of clusters of amino acids around each of these unfavourable substitutions using Monte Carlo sampling(10). A redesigned enzyme that was predicted to display altered target site specificity, while maintaining wild-type binding affinity, was experimentally characterized. The redesigned enzyme binds and cleaves the redesigned recognition site similar to 10,000 times more effectively than does the wild-type enzyme, with a level of target discrimination comparable to the original endonuclease. Determination of the structure of the redesigned nuclease-recognition site complex by X-ray crystallography confirms the accuracy of the computationally predicted interface. These results suggest that computational protein design methods can have an important role in the creation of novel highly specific endonucleases for gene therapy and other applications.","Univ Washington, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; Univ Washington, Dept Biochem, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; Univ Washington, Dept Pathol, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; Univ Washington, Dept Genome Sci, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; Fred Hutchinson Canc Res Ctr, Div Basic Sci, Seattle, WA 98109 USA","Ashworth, J (reprint author), Univ Washington, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.",ashwortj@u.washington.edu; dabaker@u.washington.edu,"Baker, David/K-8941-2012","Baker, David/0000-0001-7896-6217; Ashworth, Justin/0000-0003-4835-6551","Howard Hughes Medical Institute; NCI NIH HHS [R01 CA088942, R01 CA088942-05]; NIGMS NIH HHS [R01 GM049857, R01 GM049857-12]",,,26,227,227,2,40,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,1-Jun,2006,441,7093,,,,,656,659,,10.1038/nature04818,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,048AU,WOS:000237920800052,16738662,No,,,11/20/17

On occasion, this stellar collapse also powers an even more brilliant relativistic explosion known as a long-duration gamma-ray burst. One would then expect that these long gamma-ray bursts and core-collapse supernovae should be found in similar galactic environments. Here we show that this expectation is wrong. We find that the gamma-ray bursts are far more concentrated in the very brightest regions of their host galaxies than are the core-collapse supernovae. Furthermore, the host galaxies of the long gamma-ray bursts are significantly fainter and more irregular than the hosts of the core-collapse supernovae.

This raises the question of whether disease therapies can be developed that eliminate cancer stem cells without eliminating normal stem cells. Here we address this issue by conditionally deleting the Pten tumour suppressor gene in adult haematopoietic cells. This led to myeloproliferative disease within days and transplantable leukaemias within weeks. Pten deletion also promoted haematopoietic stem cell (HSC) proliferation. However, this led to HSC depletion via a cell-autonomous mechanism, preventing these cells from stably reconstituting irradiated mice. In contrast to leukaemia-initiating cells, HSCs were therefore unable to maintain themselves without Pten. These effects were mostly mediated by mTOR as they were inhibited by rapamycin. Rapamycin not only depleted leukaemia-initiating cells but also restored normal HSC function. Mechanistic differences between normal stem cells and cancer stem cells can thus be targeted to deplete cancer stem cells without damaging normal stem cells.","Univ Michigan, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; Univ Michigan, Inst Life Sci, Dept Internal Med, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; Univ Michigan, Ctr Stem Cell Biol, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; Univ Michigan, Dept Pathol, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; Univ Calif Los Angeles, Sch Med, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA","Morrison, SJ (reprint author), Univ Michigan, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",seanjm@umich.edu,,"Morrison, Sean/0000-0003-1587-8329",,,,42,887,948,2,38,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,25-May,2006,441,7092,,,,,475,482,,10.1038/nature04703,,8,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,045YP,WOS:000237778900042,16598206,No,,,11/20/17

Their formation mechanism is debated, but their sheer abundance suggests that the mechanism was both energetic and ubiquitous in the early inner Solar System(2). The processes suggested-such as shock waves, solar flares or nebula lightning(3-7)-operate on different length scales that have been hard to relate directly to chondrule properties. Chondrules are depleted in volatile elements, but surprisingly they show little evidence for the associated loss of lighter isotopes one would expect(8). Here we report a model in which molten chondrules come to equilibrium with the gas that was evaporated from other chondrules, and which explains the observations in a natural way. The regions within which the chondrules formed must have been larger than 150-6,000 km in radius, and must have had a precursor number density of at least 10 m(-3). These constraints probably exclude nebula lightning, and also make formation far from the nebula midplane problematic. The wide range of chondrule compositions may be the result of different combinations of the local concentrations of precursors and the local abundance of water ice or vapour.","NASA, Ames Res Ctr, Div Space Sci, Moffett Field, CA 94035 USA; Carnegie Inst Washington, Dept Terr Magnetism, Washington, DC 20015 USA","Cuzzi, JN (reprint author), NASA, Ames Res Ctr, Div Space Sci, Moffett Field, CA 94035 USA.",jcuzzi@mail.arc.nasa.gov,"Alexander, Conel/N-7533-2013","Alexander, Conel/0000-0002-8558-1427",,,,27,79,79,1,5,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,25-May,2006,441,7092,,,,,483,485,,10.1038/nature04834,,3,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,045YP,WOS:000237778900043,16724060,No,,,11/20/17

In the case of X-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD), the absorption cross-section of a ferromagnet or a paramagnet in a magnetic field changes when the helicity of a circularly polarized photon is reversed relative to the magnetization direction. Although similarities between X-ray absorption and electron energy-loss spectroscopy in a transmission electron microscope (TEM) have long been recognized, it has been assumed that extending such equivalence to circular dichroism would require the electron beam in the TEM to be spin-polarized. Recently, it was argued on theoretical grounds that this assumption is probably wrong(1). Here we report the direct experimental detection of magnetic circular dichroism in a TEM. We compare our measurements of electron energy-loss magnetic chiral dichroism (EMCD) with XMCD spectra obtained from the same specimen that, together with theoretical calculations, show that chiral atomic transitions in a specimen are accessible with inelastic electron scattering under particular scattering conditions. This finding could have important consequences for the study of magnetism on the nanometre and subnanometre scales, as EMCD offers the potential for such spatial resolution down to the nanometre scale while providing depth information-in contrast to X-ray methods, which are mainly surface-sensitive.","Vienna Univ Technol, Serv Ctr Transmiss Electron Microscopy, A-1040 Vienna, Austria; Vienna Univ Technol, Inst Festkorperphys, A-1040 Vienna, Austria; Inst Phys ASCR, Prague 16253 6, Czech Republic; CNR Natl Lab, TASC INFM, I-34012 Trieste, Italy; Univ Trieste, I-34100 Trieste, Italy; Univ Modena & Reggio Emilia, Dipartimento Fis, I-41100 Modena, Italy","Schattschneider, P (reprint author), Vienna Univ Technol, Serv Ctr Transmiss Electron Microscopy, Wiedner Hauptstr 8-10-052, A-1040 Vienna, Austria.",schatt@ifp.tuwien.ac.at,"Rusz, Jan/A-3324-2008; Kunes, Jan/B-4484-2008; Novak, Pavel/G-6692-2014; Rubino, Stefano/I-4063-2012; Hebert, Cecile/B-9381-2012","Rusz, Jan/0000-0002-0074-1349; Kunes, Jan/0000-0001-9682-7640; Rubino, Stefano/0000-0001-5738-0591; Hebert, Cecile/0000-0002-7086-1901; Schattschneider, Peter/0000-0002-1225-7554; Carlino, Elvio/0000-0003-0285-7297",,,,21,166,168,11,105,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,25-May,2006,441,7092,,,,,486,488,,10.1038/nature04778,,3,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,045YP,WOS:000237778900044,16724061,No,,,11/20/17

Studies have demonstrated long carrier mean free paths at room temperature in both carbon nanotubes1,6 and Ge/Si core/shell nanowires(7). In the case of carbon nanotube FETs, devices have been fabricated that work close to the ballistic limit(8). Applications of high-performance carbon nanotube FETs have been hindered, however, by difficulties in producing uniform semiconducting nanotubes, a factor not limiting nanowires, which have been prepared with reproducible electronic properties in high yield as required for large-scale integrated systems(3,9,10). Yet whether nanowire field-effect transistors (NWFETs) can indeed outperform their planar counterparts is still unclear(4). Here we report studies on Ge/Si core/shell nanowire heterostructures configured as FETs using high-kappa dielectrics in a top-gate geometry. The clean one-dimensional hole-gas in the Ge/Si nanowire heterostructures(7) and enhanced gate coupling with high-kappa dielectrics give high-performance FETs values of the scaled transconductance (3.3 mS mu m(-1)) and on-current (2.1 mA mu m(-1)) that are three to four times greater than state-of-the-art MOSFETs and are the highest obtained on NWFETs. Furthermore, comparison of the intrinsic switching delay, tau = CV/I, which represents a key metric for device applications(4,11), shows that the performance of Ge/Si NWFETs is comparable to similar length carbon nanotube FETs and substantially exceeds the length-dependent scaling of planar silicon MOSFETs.","Harvard Univ, Dept Chem & Biol Chem, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; Harvard Univ, Div Engn & Appl Sci, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA","Lieber, CM (reprint author), Harvard Univ, Dept Chem & Biol Chem, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",cml@cmliris.harvard.edu,"Lu, Wei/E-8388-2011; _, __/H-4357-2011; Hu, Yongjie/A-8308-2013","Lu, Wei/0000-0003-4731-1976; ",,,,30,1058,1068,22,400,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,25-May,2006,441,7092,,,,,489,493,,10.1038/nature04796,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,045YP,WOS:000237778900045,16724062,No,,,11/20/17

Most observations and sampling of submarine eruptions have been indirect, made from surface vessels or made after the fact(1-6). We describe here direct observations and sampling of an eruption at a submarine arc volcano named NW Rota-1, located 60 km northwest of the island of Rota (Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands). We observed a pulsating plume permeated with droplets of molten sulphur disgorging volcanic ash and lapilli from a 15-m diameter pit in March 2004 and again in October 2005 near the summit of the volcano at a water depth of 555 m (depth in 2004). A turbid layer found on the flanks of the volcano (in 2004) at depths from 700 m to more than 1,400 m was probably formed by mass-wasting events related to the eruption. Long-term eruptive activity has produced an unusual chemical environment and a very unstable benthic habitat exploited by only a few mobile decapod species.

Here, we investigate this conflict through experimental competitions between isogenic cheater and cooperator strains of yeast with alternative pathways of glucose metabolism(9), and by using mathematical models of microbial biochemistry(10). We show that both coexistence and competitive exclusion are possible outcomes of this conflict, depending on the spatial and temporal structure of the environment. Both of these outcomes are driven by trade-offs between the rate and efficiency of conversion of resources into offspring that are mediated by metabolic intermediates.","Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, NERC, Ctr Populat Biol, Ascot SL5 7PY, Berks, England; Univ Bath, Dept Math Sci, Bath BA2 7AY, Avon, England","MacLean, RC (reprint author), Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, NERC, Ctr Populat Biol, Silwood Pk Campus, Ascot SL5 7PY, Berks, England.",c.maclean@imperial.ac.uk,,"MacLean, Craig/0000-0002-7941-813X",,,,20,146,150,2,57,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,25-May,2006,441,7092,,,,,498,501,,10.1038/nature04624,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,045YP,WOS:000237778900047,16724064,No,,,11/20/17

There is much current interest, however, in studying evolutionary games in structured populations and on graphs(8-17). These efforts recognize the fact that who-meets-whom is not random, but determined by spatial relationships or social networks(18-24). Here we describe a surprisingly simple rule that is a good approximation for all graphs that we have analysed, including cycles, spatial lattices, random regular graphs, random graphs and scale-free networks(25,26): natural selection favours cooperation, if the benefit of the altruistic act, b, divided by the cost, c, exceeds the average number of neighbours, k, which means b/c > k.

There has been long-running controversy, however, concerning which head appendages are homologous among arthropods, and from which ancestral arrangement they have been derived. This controversy has recently been rekindled by the proposition that the probable ancestral arrangement, with appendages on the first head segment, has not been lost in all extant arthropods as previously thought, but has been retained in the pycnogonids, or sea spiders(1). This proposal was based on the neuroanatomical analysis of larvae from the sea spider Anoplodactylus sp., and suggested that the most anterior pair of appendages, the chelifores, are innervated from the first part of the brain, the protocerebrum. Our examination of Hox gene expression in another sea spider, Endeis spinosa, refutes this hypothesis. The anterior boundaries of Hox gene expression domains place the chelifore appendages as clearly belonging to the second head segment, innervated from the second part of the brain, the deutocerebrum. The deutocerebrum must have been secondarily displaced towards the protocerebrum in pycnogonid ancestors.

They are transmitted vertically from the female hosts to their offspring, in a pattern analogous to mitochondria inheritance. But Wolbachia phylogeny does not parallel that of the host, indicating that horizontal infectious transmission must also occur(3-5). Insect parasitoids are considered the most likely vectors, but the mechanism for horizontal transfer is largely unknown(4,6,7). Here we show that newly introduced Wolbachia cross several tissues and infect the germline of the adult Drosophila melanogaster female. Through investigation of bacterial migration patterns during the course of infection, we found that Wolbachia reach the germline through the somatic stem cell niche in the D. melanogaster germarium. In addition, our data suggest that Wolbachia are highly abundant in the somatic stem cell niche of long-term infected hosts, implying that this location may also contribute to efficient vertical transmission. This is, to our knowledge, the first report of an intracellular parasite displaying tropism for a stem cell niche.","Princeton Univ, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Princeton, NJ 08540 USA; Princeton Univ, Dept Mol Biol, Princeton, NJ 08540 USA","Frydman, HM (reprint author), Princeton Univ, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Princeton, NJ 08540 USA.",hfrydman@princeton.edu,,"Frydman, Horacio/0000-0003-0191-7948",,,,27,107,110,0,22,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,25-May,2006,441,7092,,,,,509,512,,10.1038/nature04756,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,045YP,WOS:000237778900050,16724067,No,,,11/20/17

In neurodegenerative diseases, several chaperones ameliorate the accumulation of misfolded proteins triggered by oxidative or nitrosative stress, or of mutated gene products(4,5). Although severe ER stress can induce apoptosis(2,6), the ER withstands relatively mild insults through the expression of stress proteins or chaperones such as glucose-regulated protein (GRP) and protein-disulphide isomerase (PDI), which assist in the maturation and transport of unfolded secretory proteins. PDI catalyses thiol-disulphide exchange, thus facilitating disulphide bond formation and rearrangement reactions(7-10). PDI has two domains that function as independent active sites with homology to the small, redox-active protein thioredoxin(7,8). During neurodegenerative disorders and cerebral ischaemia, the accumulation of immature and denatured proteins results in ER dysfunction(11), but the upregulation of PDI represents an adaptive response to protect neuronal cells(12-14). Here we show, in brains manifesting sporadic Parkinson's or Alzheimer's disease, that PDI is S-nitrosylated, a reaction transferring a nitric oxide (NO) group to a critical cysteine thiol to affect protein function(15-18). NO-induced S-nitrosylation of PDI inhibits its enzymatic activity, leads to the accumulation of polyubiquitinated proteins, and activates the unfolded protein response. S-Nitrosylation also abrogates PDI-mediated attenuation of neuronal cell death triggered by ER stress, misfolded proteins or proteasome inhibition. Thus, PDI prevents neurotoxicity associated with ER stress and protein misfolding, but NO blocks this protective effect in neurodegenerative disorders through the S-nitrosylation of PDI.","Burnham Inst Med Res, Ctr Neurosci & Aging, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; Burnham Inst Med Res, Proteom Facil, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Neurosci, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; Hokkaido Univ, Grad Sch Pharmaceut Sci, Dept Pharmacol, Sapporo, Hokkaido 0600812, Japan","Lipton, SA (reprint author), Burnham Inst Med Res, Ctr Neurosci & Aging, 10901 N Torrey Pines Rd, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA.",slipton@burnham.org,,,,,,30,531,549,4,48,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,25-May,2006,441,7092,,,,,513,517,,10.1038/nature04782,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,045YP,WOS:000237778900051,16724068,No,,,11/20/17

Phosphatase and tensin homologue ( PTEN) functions as a negative regulator of the phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase (PI(3)K)-Akt pathway, which has crucial roles in cell proliferation, survival, differentiation and migration(4,5). Here we show that inactivation of PTEN in bone marrow HSCs causes their short-term expansion, but long-term decline, primarily owing to an enhanced level of HSC activation. PTEN-deficient HSCs engraft normally in recipient mice, but have an impaired ability to sustain haematopoietic reconstitution, reflecting the dysregulation of their cell cycle and decreased retention in the bone marrow niche. Mice with PTEN-mutant bone marrow also have an increased representation of myeloid and T-lymphoid lineages and develop myeloproliferative disorder (MPD)(6). Notably, the cell populations that expand in PTEN mutants match those that become dominant in the acute myeloid/lymphoid leukaemia that develops in the later stages of MPD. Thus, PTEN has essential roles in restricting the activation of HSCs, in lineage fate determination, and in the prevention of leukaemogenesis.","Stowers Inst Med Res, Kansas City, MO 64110 USA; Univ Calif Los Angeles, Sch Med, Dept Mol & Med Pharmacol, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; Univ Kansas, Med Ctr, Dept Pathol & Lab Med, Kansas City, KS 66160 USA","Li, LH (reprint author), Stowers Inst Med Res, Kansas City, MO 64110 USA.",lil@stowers-institute.org,"Wiedemann, Leanne/E-3316-2010",,,,,30,521,555,1,20,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,25-May,2006,441,7092,,,,,518,522,,10.1038/nature04747,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,045YP,WOS:000237778900052,16633340,No,,,11/20/17

In such tumours, AKT becomes enriched at cell membranes where it is activated by phosphorylation. Yet many targets inhibited by phosphorylated AKT (for example, the FOXO transcription factors) are nuclear; it has remained unclear how relevant nuclear phosphorylated AKT (pAKT) function is for tumorigenesis. Here we show that the PML tumour suppressor prevents cancer by inactivating pAKT inside the nucleus. We find in a mouse model that Pml loss markedly accelerates tumour onset, incidence and progression in Pten-heterozygous mutants, and leads to female sterility with features that recapitulate the phenotype of Foxo3a knockout mice(2). We show that Pml deficiency on its own leads to tumorigenesis in the prostate, a tissue that is exquisitely sensitive to pAkt levels, and demonstrate that Pml specifically recruits the Akt phosphatase PP2a as well as pAkt into Pml nuclear bodies. Notably, we find that Pml-null cells are impaired in PP2a phosphatase activity towards Akt, and thus accumulate nuclear pAkt. As a consequence, the progressive reduction in Pml dose leads to inactivation of Foxo3a-mediated transcription of proapoptotic Bim and the cell cycle inhibitor p27(kip1). Our results demonstrate that Pml orchestrates a nuclear tumour suppressor network for inactivation of nuclear pAkt, and thus highlight the importance of AKT compartmentalization in human cancer pathogenesis and treatment.","Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Sloan Kettering Inst, Canc Biol & Genet Program, New York, NY 10021 USA; Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Sloan Kettering Inst, Dept Pathol, New York, NY 10021 USA; Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Sloan Kettering Inst, Dept Med, New York, NY 10021 USA; Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Sloan Kettering Inst, Dept Radiol, New York, NY 10021 USA; Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Sloan Kettering Inst, Dept Med Phys, New York, NY 10021 USA","Pandolfi, PP (reprint author), Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Sloan Kettering Inst, Canc Biol & Genet Program, 1275 York Ave, New York, NY 10021 USA.",p-pandolfi@ski.mskcc.org,"Alimonti, Andrea/J-4150-2012","Scaglioni, Pier Paolo/0000-0002-6036-5138","NCI NIH HHS [P50 CA092629, P50 CA092629-05, R01 CA137050]",,,30,275,284,0,14,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,25-May,2006,441,7092,,,,,523,527,,10.1038/nature04809,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,045YP,WOS:000237778900053,16680151,No,,,11/20/17

It was initially proposed to act as a machine that constricts and cuts the neck of nascent vesicles in a GTP-hydrolysis-dependent reaction(4,5), but subsequent studies suggested alternative models(2,7,8). Here we monitored the effect of nucleotides on dynamin-coated lipid tubules in real time. Addition of GTP, but not of GDP or GTP-gamma S, resulted in twisting of the tubules and supercoiling, suggesting a rotatory movement of the helix turns relative to each other during GTP hydrolysis. Rotation was confirmed by the movement of beads attached to the tubules. Twisting activity produced a longitudinal tension that was released by tubule breakage when both ends of the tubule were anchored. Fission also occurred when dynamin and GTP were added to lipid tubules that had been generated from liposomes by the motor activity of kinesin on microtubules. No fission events were observed in the absence of longitudinal tension. These findings demonstrate a mechanoenzyme activity of dynamin in endocytosis, but also imply that constriction is not sufficient for fission. At the short necks of endocytic vesicles, other factors(6,9,10) leading to tension may cooperate with the constricting activity of dynamin to induce fission(11-13).","Yale Univ, Sch Med, Kavli Inst Neurosci, Howard Hughes Med Inst,Dept Cell Biol, New Haven, CT 06510 USA; Yale Univ, Sch Med, Boyer Ctr Mol Med, Dept Biochem & Mol Biophys, New Haven, CT 06510 USA","De Camilli, P (reprint author), Yale Univ, Sch Med, Kavli Inst Neurosci, Howard Hughes Med Inst,Dept Cell Biol, 333 Cedar St, New Haven, CT 06510 USA.",pietro.decamilli@yale.edu,"Roux, Aurelien/G-9541-2013","Roux, Aurelien/0000-0002-6088-0711",,,,30,296,308,1,38,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,25-May,2006,441,7092,,,,,528,531,,10.1038/nature04718,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,045YP,WOS:000237778900054,16648839,No,,,11/20/17

Retention of cohesins around centromeres until meiosis II is required for the accurate segregation of sister chromatids. Here we show that phosphorylation of the cohesin subunit Rec8 contributes to step-wise cohesin removal. Our data further implicate two other key regulators of meiotic chromosome segregation, the cohesin protector Sgo1 and meiotic recombination in bringing about the step-wise loss of cohesins and thus the establishment of the meiotic chromosome segregation pattern.

Because this mechanism can be efficiently induced in vivo by expressing target-complementary short hairpin RNA (shRNA) from non-viral and viral vectors, RNAi is attractive for functional genomics and human therapeutics(3,4). Here we systematically investigate the long-term effects of sustained high-level shRNA expression in livers of adult mice. Robust shRNA expression in all the hepatocytes after intravenous infusion was achieved with an optimized shRNA delivery vector based on duplex-DNA-containing adeno-associated virus type 8 (AAV8). An evaluation of 49 distinct AAV/shRNA vectors, unique in length and sequence and directed against six targets, showed that 36 resulted in dose-dependent liver injury, with 23 ultimately causing death. Morbidity was associated with the downregulation of liver-derived microRNAs (miRNAs), indicating possible competition of the latter with shRNAs for limiting cellular factors required for the processing of various small RNAs. In vitro and in vivo shRNA transfection studies implied that one such factor, shared by the shRNA/miRNA pathways and readily saturated, is the nuclear karyopherin exportin-5. Our findings have fundamental consequences for future RNAi-based strategies in animals and humans, because controlling intracellular shRNA expression levels will be imperative. However, the risk of oversaturating endogenous small RNA pathways can be minimized by optimizing shRNA dose and sequence, as exemplified here by our report of persistent and therapeutic RNAi against human hepatitis B virus in vivo.","Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Dept Pediat, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Dept Genet, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Dept Microbiol & Immunol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Dept Comparat Med, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; Hepadnavirus Testing Inc, Mountain View, CA 94043 USA","Kay, MA (reprint author), Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Dept Pediat, 300 Pasteur Dr, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",markay@stanford.edu,,,,,,30,1068,1145,9,125,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,25-May,2006,441,7092,,,,,537,541,,10.1038/nature04791,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,045YP,WOS:000237778900056,16724069,No,,,11/20/17

The bacterium Myxococcus xanthus survives starvation by the social development of spore-bearing fruiting bodies. Some M. xanthus genotypes defective at fruiting body development in isolation can nonetheless exploit proficient genotypes in chimaeric groups. Here we report an evolutionary transition from obligate dependence on an altruistic host to an autonomous mode of social cooperation. This restoration of social independence was caused by a single mutation of large effect that confers fitness superiority over both ancestral genotypes, including immunity from exploitation by the ancestral cheater. Thus, a temporary state of obligate cheating served as an evolutionary stepping-stone to a novel state of autonomous social dominance.","Max Planck Inst Dev Biol, D-72076 Tubingen, Germany","Velicer, GJ (reprint author), Max Planck Inst Dev Biol, Spemannstr 35, D-72076 Tubingen, Germany.",gregory.velicer@tuebingen.mpg.de,,,,,,48,93,94,0,28,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,18-May,2006,441,7091,,,,,310,314,,10.1038/nature04677,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,043IB,WOS:000237593200039,16710413,No,,,11/20/17

Fluctuations in the distribution of these galaxies contributed to a scatter in the ionization fraction of cosmic hydrogen on scales of tens of megaparsecs, as observed along the lines of sight to the earliest known quasars(7-9). Theoretical simulations predict that the formation of dwarf galaxies should have been suppressed after cosmic hydrogen was reionized(10-13), leading to a drop in the cosmic star-formation rate(14). Here we report evidence for this suppression. We show that the post-reionization galaxies that produced most of the ionizing radiation at a redshift z approximate to 5.5 must have had a mass in excess of similar to 10(10.9+/-0.5) solar masses (M-.) or else the aforementioned scatter would have been smaller than observed. This limiting mass is two orders of magnitude larger than the galaxy mass that is thought to have dominated the reionization of cosmic hydrogen (similar to 10(8) M-.). We predict that future surveys with space-based infrared telescopes will detect a population of smaller galaxies that reionized the Universe at an earlier time, before the epoch of dwarf galaxy suppression.","Harvard Smithsonian Ctr Astrophys, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; Univ Melbourne, Parkville, Vic 3010, Australia","Loeb, A (reprint author), Harvard Smithsonian Ctr Astrophys, 60 Garden St, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",swyithe@physics.unimelb.edu.au; aloeb@cfa.harvard.edu,,"Wyithe, Stuart/0000-0001-7956-9758",,,,33,31,31,0,1,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,18-May,2006,441,7091,,,,,322,324,,10.1038/nature04748,,3,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,043IB,WOS:000237593200041,16710415,No,,,11/20/17

Microelectronic fabrication technologies and the environmental sciences both require light sources with shorter emission wavelengths: the former for improved resolution in photolithography and the latter for sensors that can detect minute hazardous particles. In addition, ultraviolet solid-state light sources are also attracting attention for potential applications in high-density optical data storage, biomedical research, water and air purification, and sterilization. Wide-bandgap materials, such as diamond(2) and III - V nitride semiconductors (GaN, AlGaN and AlN; refs 3 - 10), are potential materials for ultraviolet LEDs and laser diodes, but suffer from difficulties in controlling electrical conduction. Here we report the successful control of both n-type and p-type doping in aluminium nitride ( AlN), which has a very wide direct bandgap(11) of 6 eV. This doping strategy allows us to develop an AlN PIN (p-type/intrinsic/n-type) homojunction LED with an emission wavelength of 210 nm, which is the shortest reported to date for any kind of LED. The emission is attributed to an exciton transition, and represents an important step towards achieving exciton-related light-emitting devices as well as replacing gas light sources with solid-state light sources.","NTT Corp, NTT Basic Res Labs, Atsugi, Kanagawa 2430198, Japan","Taniyasu, Y (reprint author), NTT Corp, NTT Basic Res Labs, 3-1 Morinosato Wakamiya, Atsugi, Kanagawa 2430198, Japan.",taniyasu@will.brl.ntt.co.jp,,,,,,23,964,990,35,495,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,18-May,2006,441,7091,,,,,325,328,,10.1038/nature04760,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,043IB,WOS:000237593200042,16710416,No,,,11/20/17

Records of the Earth's surface temperature illustrate this interdependence, having a continuum of variability following a power-law scaling(1-7). But although specific modes of interannual variability are relatively well understood(8,9), the general controls on continuum variability are uncertain and usually described as purely stochastic processes(10-13). Here we show that power-law relationships of surface temperature variability scale with annual and Milankovitch-period ( 23,000- and 41,000- year) cycles. The annual cycle corresponds to scaling at monthly to decadal periods, while millennial and longer periods are tied to the Milankovitch cycles. Thus the annual, Milankovitch and continuum temperature variability together represent the response to deterministic insolation forcing. The identification of a deterministic control on the continuum provides insight into the mechanisms governing interannual and longer-period climate variability.","Woods Hole Oceanog Inst, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA","Huybers, P (reprint author), Woods Hole Oceanog Inst, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA.",phuybers@whoi.edu,"lionel, Scotto /K-8141-2012",,,,,30,124,129,0,24,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,18-May,2006,441,7091,,,,,329,332,,10.1038/nature04745,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,043IB,WOS:000237593200043,16710417,No,,,11/20/17

The fate of these slabs has remained unresolved, but it has been postulated that their ultimate destination is the lower-most few hundred kilometres of the mantle, known as the D '' region. Relatively cold slab material may account for high seismic velocities imaged in D '' beneath areas of long-lived plate subduction, and for reflections from a seismic velocity discontinuity just above the anomalously high wave speed regions(3,4). The D '' discontinuity itself is probably the result of a phase change in relatively low-temperature magnesium silicate perovskite(5,6). Here, we present images of the D '' region beneath the Cocos plate using Kirchhoff migration of horizontally polarized shear waves, and find a 100-km vertical step occurring over less than 100 km laterally in an otherwise flat D '' shear velocity discontinuity. Folding and piling of a cold slab that has reached the core - mantle boundary, as observed in numerical and experimental models, can account for the step by a 100-km elevation of the post-perovskite phase boundary due to a 700 degrees C lateral temperature reduction in the folded slab. We detect localized low velocities at the edge of the slab material, which may result from upwellings caused by the slab laterally displacing a thin hot thermal boundary layer.","Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Earth Sci, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA; Arizona State Univ, Dept Geol Sci, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA; Univ Minnesota, Dept Geol & Geophys, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA","Hutko, AR (reprint author), Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Earth Sci, 1156 High St, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA.",ahutko@pmc.ucsc.edu,,,,,,27,90,92,1,21,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,18-May,2006,441,7091,,,,,333,336,,10.1038/nature04757,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,043IB,WOS:000237593200044,16710418,No,,,11/20/17

We now know that within the first fifteen million years of angiosperm history, three major lineages of flowering plants - monocotyledons, eumagnoliids and eudicotyledons - were established(5), and that within this window of time, tremendous variation in vegetative and floral characteristics evolved. Here I report on a novel type of embryo sac ( angiosperm female gametophyte or haploid egg-producing structure) in Amborella trichopoda, the sole member of the most ancient extant angiosperm lineage. This is the first new pattern of embryo sac structure to be discovered among angiosperms in well over half a century. This discovery also supports the emerging view(9-12) that the earliest phases of angiosperm evolution were characterized by an extensive degree of developmental experimentation and structural lability, and may provide evidence of a critical link to the gymnospermous ancestors of flowering plants.","Univ Colorado, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Boulder, CO 80309 USA","Friedman, WE (reprint author), Univ Colorado, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Boulder, CO 80309 USA.",ned@colorado.edu,,"Friedman, William/0000-0003-0374-3427",,,,30,63,66,1,31,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,18-May,2006,441,7091,,,,,337,340,,10.1038/nature04690,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,043IB,WOS:000237593200045,16710419,No,,,11/20/17

The types and amounts of metals required by phytoplankton depends on their evolutionary history(2) and on their adaptations to metal availability(3,4), which varies widely among ocean habitats. Diatoms, for example, need considerably less iron ( Fe) to grow than chlorophyll-b-containing taxa(2), and the oceanic species demand roughly one-tenth the amount of coastal strains(5-7). Like Fe, copper (Cu) is scarce in the open sea, but notably higher concentrations of it are required for the growth of oceanic than of coastal isolates(8). Here we report that the greater Cu requirement in an oceanic diatom, Thalassiosira oceanica, is entirely due to a single Cu-containing protein, plastocyanin, which - until now - was only known to exist in organisms with chlorophyll b and cyanobacteria. Algae containing chlorophyll c, including the closely related coastal species T. weissflogii, are thought to lack plastocyanin and contain a functionally equivalent Fe-containing homologue, cytochrome c(6) (ref. 9). Copper deficiency in T. oceanica inhibits electron transport regardless of Fe status, implying a constitutive role for plastocyanin in the light reactions of photosynthesis in this species. The results suggest that selection pressure imposed by Fe limitation has resulted in the use of a Cu protein for photosynthesis in an oceanic diatom. This biochemical switch reduces the need for Fe and increases the requirement for Cu, which is relatively more abundant in the open sea.","McGill Univ, Dept Biol, Montreal, PQ H3A 1B1, Canada","Peers, G (reprint author), McGill Univ, Dept Biol, 1205 Doctor Penfield Ave, Montreal, PQ H3A 1B1, Canada.",graham.peers@mail.mcgill.ca,,,,,,30,144,151,6,58,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,18-May,2006,441,7091,,,,,341,344,,10.1038/nature04630,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,043IB,WOS:000237593200046,16572122,No,,,11/20/17

Although the larvae of certain hydrothermal vent tubeworms (Vestimentifera, Siboglinidae) are symbiont-free and possess a transient digestive system, these structures are lost during development, resulting in adult animals that are nutritionally dependent on their bacterial symbionts. Thus, each generation of tubeworms must be newly colonized with its specific symbiont(1,2). Here we present a model for tubeworm symbiont acquisition and the development of the symbiont-housing organ, the trophosome. Our data indicate that the bacterial symbionts colonize the developing tube of the settled larvae and enter the host through the skin, a process that continues through the early juvenile stages during which the trophosome is established from mesodermal tissue. In later juvenile stages we observed massive apoptosis of host epidermis, muscles and undifferentiated mesodermal tissue, which was coincident with the cessation of the colonization process. Characterizing the symbiont transmission process in this finely tuned mutualistic symbiosis provides another model of symbiont acquisition and additional insights into underlying mechanisms common to both pathogenic infections and beneficial host - symbiont interactions.","Univ Vienna, Dept Marine Biol, A-1090 Vienna, Austria; Penn State Univ, Dept Biol, Mueller Lab 208, University Pk, PA 16802 USA","Bright, M (reprint author), Univ Vienna, Dept Marine Biol, Althanstr 14, A-1090 Vienna, Austria.",monika.bright@univie.ac.at,"Fisher, Charles/H-7912-2012; Bright, Monika/I-5542-2012","Bright, Monika/0000-0001-7066-1363",,,,30,98,104,5,78,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,18-May,2006,441,7091,,,,,345,348,,10.1038/nature04793,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,043IB,WOS:000237593200047,16710420,No,,,11/20/17

Polycomb group (PcG) proteins are transcriptional repressors that help to maintain cellular identity during metazoan development by epigenetic modification of chromatin structure(1). PcG proteins have essential roles in early embryonic development(2-6) and have been implicated in ES cell pluripotency(2), but few of their target genes are known in mammals. Here we show that PcG proteins directly repress a large cohort of developmental regulators in murine ES cells, the expression of which would otherwise promote differentiation. Using genome-wide location analysis in murine ES cells, we found that the Polycomb repressive complexes PRC1 and PRC2 co-occupied 512 genes, many of which encode transcription factors with important roles in development. All of the co-occupied genes contained modified nucleosomes (trimethylated Lys 27 on histone H3). Consistent with a causal role in gene silencing in ES cells, PcG target genes were de-repressed in cells deficient for the PRC2 component Eed, and were preferentially activated on induction of differentiation.

Unlike colour after-images, gustatory aftereffects are poorly understood(1). One theory posits that 'water-tastes' are adaptation phenomena, in which adaptation to one taste solution causes the water presented subsequently to act as a taste stimulus(2,3). An alternative hypothesis is that removal of the stimulus upon rinsing generates a receptor-based, positive, off-response in taste-receptor cells, ultimately inducing a gustatory perception(4). Here we show that a sweet 'water-taste' is elicited when sweet-taste inhibitors are rinsed away. Responses of cultured cells expressing the human sweetener receptor directly parallel the psychophysical responses - water rinses remove the inhibitor from the heteromeric sweetener receptor TAS1R2 - TAS1R3, which activates cells and results in the perception of strong sweetness from pure water. This 'rebound' activity occurs when equilibrium forces on the two-state allosteric sweet receptors result in their coordinated shift to the activated state upon being released from inhibition by rinsing(5-7).","Monell Chem Senses Ctr, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; German Inst Human Nutr Potsdam Rehbruecke, D-14558 Nuthetal, Germany","Breslin, PAS (reprint author), Monell Chem Senses Ctr, 3500 Market St, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",breslin@monell.org,"Marion-Poll, Frederic/D-8882-2011","Marion-Poll, Frederic/0000-0001-6824-0180",,,,30,65,67,2,18,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,18-May,2006,441,7091,,,,,354,357,,10.1038/nature04765,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,043IB,WOS:000237593200049,16633339,No,,,11/20/17

Although the scientific community has avidly pursued the discovery of new antibiotics that interact with new targets, these efforts have met with limited success since the early 1960s(1,2). Here we report the discovery of platensimycin, a previously unknown class of antibiotics produced by Streptomyces platensis. Platensimycin demonstrates strong, broad-spectrum Gram-positive antibacterial activity by selectively inhibiting cellular lipid biosynthesis. We show that this anti-bacterial effect is exerted through the selective targeting of beta-ketoacyl-(acyl-carrier-protein(ACP)) synthase I/II (FabF/B) in the synthetic pathway of fatty acids. Direct binding assays show that platensimycin interacts specifically with the acyl-enzyme intermediate of the target protein, and X-ray crystallographic studies reveal that a specific conformational change that occurs on acylation must take place before the inhibitor can bind. Treatment with platensimycin eradicates Staphylococcus aureus infection in mice. Because of its unique mode of action, platensimycin shows no cross-resistance to other key antibiotic-resistant strains tested, including methicillin-resistant S. aureus, vancomycin-intermediate S. aureus and vancomycin-resistant enterococci. Platensimycin is the most potent inhibitor reported for the FabF/ B condensing enzymes, and is the only inhibitor of these targets that shows broad-spectrum activity, in vivo efficacy and no observed toxicity.","Merck Res Labs, Rahway, NJ 07065 USA","Wang, J (reprint author), Merck Res Labs, Rahway, NJ 07065 USA.",jun_wang2@merck.com; stephen_soisson@merck.com; sheo_singh@merck.com,"Silver, Lynn/A-7789-2009; Pelaez, Fernando/K-1790-2014; Genilloud, Olga/I-2779-2015; vicente, francisca/N-5126-2014; Tormo, Jose/M-1044-2014","Silver, Lynn/0000-0002-8416-0487; Genilloud, Olga/0000-0002-4202-1219; vicente, francisca/0000-0003-3198-9205; Tormo, Jose/0000-0001-6984-2941",,,,25,530,563,16,90,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,18-May,2006,441,7091,,,,,358,361,,10.1038/nature04784,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,043IB,WOS:000237593200050,16710421,No,,,11/20/17

The Akt/mTOR ( mammalian target of rapamycin) signalling pathway has a central role in the control of protein synthesis and thus the growth of cells, tissues and organisms(1). A striking example of a physiological context requiring rapid cell growth is tissue repair in response to injury(2). Here we show that keratin 17, an intermediate filament protein rapidly induced in wounded stratified epithelia(3), regulates cell growth through binding to the adaptor protein 14-3-3 sigma. Mouse skin keratinocytes lacking keratin 17 (ref. 4) show depressed protein translation and are of smaller size, correlating with decreased Akt/mTOR signalling activity. Other signalling kinases have normal activity, pointing to the specificity of this defect. Two amino acid residues located in the amino-terminal head domain of keratin 17 are required for the serum-dependent relocalization of 14-3-3 sigma from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, and for the concomitant stimulation of mTOR activity and cell growth. These findings reveal a new and unexpected role for the intermediate filament cytoskeleton in influencing cell growth and size by regulating protein synthesis.","Johns Hopkins Univ, Sch Med, Dept Biol Chem, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA; Johns Hopkins Univ, Sch Med, Dept Dermatol, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA","Coulombe, PA (reprint author), Johns Hopkins Univ, Sch Med, Dept Biol Chem, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA.",coulombe@jhmi.edu,"Kim, Seyun/B-3387-2012",,,,,30,220,235,1,17,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,18-May,2006,441,7091,,,,,362,365,,10.1038/nature04659,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,043IB,WOS:000237593200051,16710422,No,,,11/20/17

To delineate the role of p110 alpha, a ubiquitously expressed PI( 3) K involved in tyrosine kinase and Ras signalling, here we generated mice carrying a knockin mutation (D933A) that abrogates p110 alpha kinase activity. Homozygosity for this kinase-dead p110 alpha led to embryonic lethality. Mice heterozygous for this mutation were viable and fertile, but displayed severely blunted signalling via insulin-receptor substrate (IRS) proteins, key mediators of insulin, insulin-like growth factor-1 and leptin action. Defective responsiveness to these hormones led to reduced somatic growth, hyperinsulinaemia, glucose intolerance, hyperphagia and increased adiposity in mice heterozygous for the D933A mutation. This signalling function of p110 alpha derives from its highly selective recruitment and activation to IRS signalling complexes compared to p110 beta, the other broadly expressed PI( 3) K isoform, which did not contribute to IRS-associated PI( 3) K activity. p110 alpha was the principal IRS-associated PI( 3) K in cancer cell lines. These findings demonstrate a critical role for p110 alpha in growth factor and metabolic signalling and also suggest an explanation for selective mutation or overexpression of p110 alpha in a variety of cancers(1,2).","Ludwig Inst Canc Res, London W1W 7BS, England; UCL, Rayne Inst, Ctr Diabet & Endocrinol, London WC1E 6JJ, England; Univ Edinburgh, Inst Stem Cell Res, Gene Targeting Lab, Edinburgh EH9 3JQ, Midlothian, Scotland; Univ Fribourg, Dept Med, CH-1700 Fribourg, Switzerland; UCL, Dept Biochem & Mol Biol, London WC1E 6BT, England","Vanhaesebroeck, B (reprint author), Ludwig Inst Canc Res, 91 Riding House St, London W1W 7BS, England.",bartvanh@ludwig.ucl.ac.uk,"Okkenhaug, Klaus/D-5149-2012; Withers, Dominic/D-7671-2014","Okkenhaug, Klaus/0000-0002-9432-4051; Withers, Dominic/0000-0002-8009-7521; Claret, Marc/0000-0001-7766-9296",Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council [BB/C505659/1]; Medical Research Council [G0300058],,,30,286,291,0,7,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,18-May,2006,441,7091,,,,,366,370,,10.1038/nature04694,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,043IB,WOS:000237593200052,16625210,No,,,11/20/17

The model identifies the difference in volume between the two cell types as the primary trigger for determining cell fate.

The first step of splicing, intron recognition and cleavage, is performed by the tRNA-splicing endonuclease, a tetrameric enzyme composed of the protein subunits Sen54, Sen2, Sen34 and Sen15. It has previously been demonstrated that the active sites for cleavage at the 5' and 3' splice sites of precursor tRNA are contained within Sen2 and Sen34, respectively(1-3). A recent structure of an archaeal endonuclease complexed with a bulge - helix - bulge RNA has led to the unexpected hypothesis that catalysis requires a critical 'cation-pi sandwich' composed of two arginine residues that serve to position the RNA substrate within the active site(4). This motif is derived from a cross-subunit interaction between the two catalytic subunits. Here we test the role of this interaction within the eukaryotic endonuclease and show that catalysis at the 50 splice site requires the conserved cation-pi sandwich derived from the Sen34 subunit in addition to the catalytic triad of Sen2. The catalysis of pre-tRNA by the eukaryotic tRNA-splicing endonuclease therefore requires a previously unrecognized composite active site.","PTC Therapeut, S Plainfield, NJ 07080 USA; Florida State Univ, Inst Mol Biophys, Dept Chem & Biochem, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA","Trotta, CR (reprint author), PTC Therapeut, 100 Corp Court, S Plainfield, NJ 07080 USA.",ctrotta@ptcbio.com,,,,,,22,32,33,0,4,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,18-May,2006,441,7091,,,,,375,377,,10.1038/nature04741,,3,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,043IB,WOS:000237593200054,16710424,No,,,11/20/17

This control is mediated, in part, by cytokines that are secreted by macrophages. Immune regulation is extraordinarily complex, and can be best investigated with systems approaches ( that is, using computational tools to predict regulatory networks arising from global, high-throughput data sets). Here we use cluster analysis of a comprehensive set of transcriptomic data derived from Toll-like receptor (TLR)-activated macrophages to identify a prominent group of genes that appear to be regulated by activating transcription factor 3 (ATF3), a member of the CREB/ATF family of transcription factors. Network analysis predicted that ATF3 is part of a transcriptional complex that also contains members of the nuclear factor (NF)-kappa B family of transcription factors. Promoter analysis of the putative ATF3-regulated gene cluster demonstrated an over-representation of closely apposed ATF3 and NF-kappa B binding sites, which was verified by chromatin immunoprecipitation and hybridization to a DNA microarray. This cluster included important cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-12b. ATF3 and Rel ( a component of NF-kappa B) were shown to bind to the regulatory regions of these genes upon macrophage activation. A kinetic model of Il6 and Il12b messenger RNA expression as a function of ATF3 and NF-kappa B promoter binding predicted that ATF3 is a negative regulator of Il6 and Il12b transcription, and this hypothesis was validated using Atf3-null mice. ATF3 seems to inhibit Il6 and Il12b transcription by altering chromatin structure, thereby restricting access to transcription factors. Because ATF3 is itself induced by lipopolysaccharide, it seems to regulate TLR-stimulated inflammatory responses as part of a negative-feedback loop.","Inst Syst Biol, Seattle, WA 98103 USA; Ohio State Univ, Dept Mol & Cellular Biochem, Columbus, OH 43210 USA","Aderem, A (reprint author), Inst Syst Biol, Seattle, WA 98103 USA.",aaderem@systemsbiology.org,"Hai, Tsonwin/H-4480-2011; Hai, Tsonwin/E-3185-2011","Hai, Tsonwin/0000-0003-4510-0315; Hai, Tsonwin/0000-0003-4510-0315; Rust, Alistair/0000-0001-7287-192X",,,,27,463,478,2,30,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,11-May,2006,441,7090,,,,,173,178,,10.1038/nature04768,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,040YP,WOS:000237418800036,16688168,No,,,11/20/17

Here we identify the genetic defect in these patients, using a combination of two unbiased genome-wide approaches: a modified linkage analysis with single-nucleotide polymorphism arrays, and a Drosophila RNA interference screen designed to identify regulators of store-operated Ca(2+) entry and NFAT nuclear import. Both approaches converged on a novel protein that we call Orai1, which contains four putative transmembrane segments. The SCID patients are homozygous for a single missense mutation in ORAI1, and expression of wild-type Orai1 in SCID T cells restores store-operated Ca(2+) influx and the CRAC current ( I CRAC).
