To explore these small RNA pathways, we screened for Caenorhabditis elegans mutants displaying an enhanced response to exogenous dsRNAs. Here we describe the isolation of mutations in two adjacent, divergently transcribed open reading frames ( eri-6 and eri-7) that fail to complement. eri-6 and eri- 7 produce separate pre- messenger RNAs ( pre- mRNAs) that are trans- spliced to form a functional mRNA, eri- 6/ 7. Trans- splicing of eri6/7 is mediated by a direct repeat that flanks the eri- 6 gene. Adenosine to inosine editing within untranslated regions of eri- 6 and eri- 7 pre- mRNAs reveals a double- stranded pre- mRNA intermediate, forming in the nucleus before splicing occurs. The ERI-6/7 protein is a superfamily I helicase that both negatively regulates the exogenous RNAi pathway and functions in an endogenous RNAi pathway.","[Fischer, Sylvia E.

Here we present the 3.2 angstrom crystal structure of the bovine Ops* - G alpha CT peptide complex. G alpha CT binds to a site in opsin that is opened by an outward tilt of transmembrane helix ( TM) 6, a pairing of TM5 and TM6, and a restructured TM7 - helix 8 kink.

In the high- energy regime of X- rays and gamma-rays, outbursts with variabilities on timescales of seconds or less are routinely observed, for example in gamma-ray bursts(1) or soft gamma-ray repeaters(2). At optical wavelengths, flaring activity on such timescales has not been observed, other than from the prompt phase of one exceptional gamma-ray burst(3). This is mostly due to the fact that outbursts with strong, fast flaring are usually discovered in the high- energy regime; most optical follow-up observations of such transients use instruments with integration times exceeding tens of seconds, which are therefore unable to resolve fast variability. Here we show the observation of extremely bright and rapid optical flaring in the Galactic transient(4-7) SWIFT J195509.6+261406. Our optical light curves are phenomenologically similar to high- energy light curves of soft gamma-ray repeaters and anomalous X- ray pulsars(8), which are thought to be neutron stars with extremely high magnetic fields ( magnetars).

They are detected in our Galaxy either as soft gamma-ray repeaters or anomalous X-ray pulsars. Soft gamma-ray repeaters are a rare type of gamma-ray transient sources that are occasionally detected as bursters in the high-energy sky(2-4). No optical counterpart to the gamma-ray flares or the quiescent source has yet been identified. Here we report multi-wavelength observations of a puzzling source, SWIFT J195509+261406. We detected more than 40 flaring episodes in the optical band over a time span of three days, and a faint infrared flare 11 days later, after which the source returned to quiescence. Our radio observations confirm a Galactic nature and establish a lower distance limit of similar to 3.7 kpc. We suggest that SWIFT J195509+261406 could be an isolated magnetar whose bursting activity has been detected at optical wavelengths, and for which the long- term X- ray emission is short- lived. In this case, a new manifestation of magnetar activity has been recorded and we can consider SWIFT J195509+261406 to be a link between the 'persistent' soft gamma-ray repeaters/anomalous X- ray pulsars and dim isolated neutron stars.","[Castro-Tirado, A.

Being a statistical concept, the state cannot be obtained from a single system realization, but can instead be reconstructed(1) from an ensemble of copies through measurements on different realizations(2-4). Reconstructing the state of a set of trapped particles shielded from their environment is an important step in the investigation of the quantum - classical boundary(5). Although trapped- atom state reconstructions(6-8) have been achieved, it is challenging to perform similar experiments with trapped photons because cavities that can store light for very long times are required. Here we report the complete reconstruction and pictorial representation of a variety of radiation states trapped in a cavity in which several photons survive long enough to be repeatedly measured. Atoms crossing the cavity one by one are used to extract information about the field. We obtain images of coherent states(9), Fock states with a definite photon number and 'Schrodinger cat' states ( superpositions of coherent states with different phases(10)). These states are equivalently represented by their density matrices or Wigner functions(11). Quasi- classical coherent states have a Gaussian- shaped Wigner function, whereas the Wigner functions of Fock and Schrodinger cat states show oscillations and negativities revealing quantum interferences. Cavity damping induces decoherence that quickly washes out such oscillations(5). We observe this process and follow the evolution of decoherence by reconstructing snapshots of Schrodinger cat states at successive times. Our reconstruction procedure is a useful tool for further decoherence and quantum feedback studies of fields trapped in one or two cavities.","[Deleglise, Samuel; Dotsenko, Igor; Sayrin, Clement; Bernu, Julien; Brune, Michel; Raimond, Jean-Michel; Haroche, Serge] Univ Paris 06, CNRS, Lab Kastler Brossel, Ecole Normale Super, F-75231 Paris 05, France; [Dotsenko, Igor; Haroche, Serge] Coll France, F-75231 Paris 05, France","Haroche, S (reprint author), Univ Paris 06, CNRS, Lab Kastler Brossel, Ecole Normale Super, 24 Rue Lhomond, F-75231 Paris 05, France.",haroche@lkb.ens.fr,"Deleglise, Samuel/B-1599-2015","Deleglise, Samuel/0000-0002-8680-5170; Sayrin, Clement/0000-0002-9747-5912",Agence Nationale pour la Recherche; Japan Science and Technology Agency; European Union; Integrated Projects SCALA; CONQUEST; Delegation Generale pour l'Armement,"This work was supported by the Agence Nationale pour la Recherche (ANR), by the Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST) and by the European Union under the Integrated Projects SCALA and CONQUEST.

In magnetic materials, the direction of magnetization, a vector quantity, is of fundamental importance. In magnetic data storage, magnetization is manipulated with a current-generated magnetic field (Oersted-Ampere field), and spin current(1,2) is being studied for use in non- volatile magnetic memories(3,4). To make control of magnetization fully compatible with semiconductor devices, it is highly desirable to control magnetization using electric fields. Conventionally, this is achieved by means of magnetostriction produced by mechanically generated strain through the use of piezoelectricity(5-8). Multiferroics(9,10) have been widely studied in an alternative approach where ferroelectricity is combined with ferromagnetism. Magnetic- field control of electric polarization has been reported in these multiferroics using the magnetoelectric effect, but the inverse effect - direct electrical control of magnetization - has not so far been observed(11). Here we show that the manipulation of magnetization can be achieved solely by electric fields in a ferromagnetic semiconductor, (Ga,Mn)As. The magnetic anisotropy, which determines the magnetization direction, depends on the charge carrier (hole) concentration in (Ga,Mn) As. By applying an electric field using a metal - insulator - semiconductor structure(12-14), the hole concentration and, thereby, the magnetic anisotropy can be controlled, allowing manipulation of the magnetization direction.","[Chiba, D.; Sawicki, M.; Nishitani, Y.; Matsukura, F.; Ohno, H.] Tohoku Univ, Aoba Ku, Lab Nanoelect & Spintron, Res Inst Elect Commun, Sendai, Miyagi 9808577, Japan; [Chiba, D.; Matsukura, F.; Ohno, H.] Japan Sci & Technol Agcy, Chiyoda Ku, Semicond Spintron Project, Tokyo 1020075, Japan; [Sawicki, M.] Polish Acad Sci, Inst Phys, PL-02668 Warsaw, Poland; [Nakatani, Y.] Univ Electrocommun, Tokyo 1828585, Japan","Ohno, H (reprint author), Tohoku Univ, Aoba Ku, Lab Nanoelect & Spintron, Res Inst Elect Commun, Katahira 2-1-1, Sendai, Miyagi 9808577, Japan.",ohno@riec.tohoku.ac.jp,"Ohno, Hideo/E-6453-2010; Sawicki, Maciej/F-5906-2013; Chiba, Daichi/D-3438-2015","Ohno, Hideo/0000-0001-9688-8259; Chiba, Daichi/0000-0002-6631-5131",MEXT/JSPS; GCOE Program at Tohoku University; Research and Development for Next-Generation Information Technology Program (MEXT); Research Fellowship from JSPS,"We acknowledge discussion with M.

This is a main contributor to the production of North Atlantic Deep Water(2) that feeds the lower limb of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation, which has been predicted to weaken as a consequence of climate change(3,4). The two main overflow branches pass the Denmark Strait and the Faroe Bank channel. Here we combine results from direct current measurements in the Faroe Bank channel(5) for 1995 - 2005 with an ensemble hindcast experiment(6) for 1948 - 2005 using an ocean general circulation model. For the overlapping period we find a convincing agreement between model simulations and observations on monthly to interannual timescales. Both observations and model data show no significant trend in volume transport. In addition, for the whole 1948 - 2005 period, the model indicates no persistent trend in the Faroe Bank channel overflow or in the total overflow transport, in agreement with the few available historical observations. Deepening isopycnals in the Norwegian Sea have tended to decrease the pressure difference across the Greenland - Scotland ridge(7), but this has been compensated for by the effect of changes in sea level. In contrast with earlier studies(7,8), we therefore conclude that the Faroe Bank channel overflow, and also the total overflow, did not decrease consistently from 1950 to 2005, although the model does show a weakening total Atlantic meridional overturning circulation as a result of changes south of the Greenland - Scotland ridge.","[Olsen, Steffen M.] Danish Meteorol Inst, DK-2100 Copenhagen, Denmark; [Hansen, Bogi] Faroese Fisheries Lab, FO-110 Torshavn, Faroe Islands, Denmark; [Quadfasel, Detlef] Univ Hamburg, Zentrum Meeres & Klimaforsch, D-20146 Hamburg, Germany; [Osterhus, Svein] Univ Bergen, Bjerknes Ctr Climate Res, NO-5014 Bergen, Norway","Olsen, SM (reprint author), Danish Meteorol Inst, Lyngbyvej 100, DK-2100 Copenhagen, Denmark.",smo@dmi.dk,,,European Commission; Danish Environmental Ministry; Nordic Council in the project Arctic-Atlantic Exchanges (ARATEX); German Federal Ministry of Education and Research ( BMBF); North Atlantic Project; Research Council of Norway; POCAHONTAS; CNES,"This work was partly supported by the European Commission as part of the MOEN (Meridional Overturning Exchange with the Nordic Seas) project, the Danish Environmental Ministry through the Danish Cooperation for Environment in the Arctic (DANCEA) programme, the Nordic Council in the project Arctic-Atlantic Exchanges (ARATEX), the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research ( BMBF) in the North Atlantic Project, and the Research Council of Norway in the projects BIAC ( Bipolar Atlantic Thermohaline Circulation) and POCAHONTAS ( Polar Climate and Heat Transport).

In particular, progress in both medium- range and seasonal- to- interannual climate prediction relies on our understanding of recurrent weather patterns and the identification of specific causes responsible for their favoured occurrence, persistence or transition. Within this framework, I here present evidence that the main climate intra- seasonal oscillation in the tropics - the Madden - Julian Oscillation(1,2) ( MJO) - controls part of the distribution and sequences of the four daily weather regimes defined over the North Atlantic - European region in winter(3). North Atlantic Oscillation(4) ( NAO) regimes are the most affected, allowing for medium- range predictability of their phase far exceeding the limit of around one week that is usually quoted. The tropical - extratropical lagged relationship is asymmetrical. Positive NAO events mostly respond to a mid- latitude low- frequency wave train initiated by the MJO in the western - central tropical Pacific and propagating eastwards. Precursors for negative NAO events are found in the eastern tropical Pacific - western Atlantic, leading to changes along the North Atlantic storm track. Wave- breaking diagnostics tend to support the MJO preconditioning and the role of transient eddies in setting the phase of the NAO. I present a simple statistical model to quantitatively assess the potential predictability of the daily NAO index or the sign of the NAO regimes when they occur. Forecasts are successful in similar to 70 per cent of the cases based on the knowledge of the previous similar to 12- day MJO phase used as a predictor. This promising skill could be of importance considering the tight link(4) between weather regimes and both mean conditions and the chances of extreme events occurring over Europe. These findings are useful for further stressing the need to better simulate and forecast the tropical coupled ocean - atmosphere dynamics, which is a source of medium- to- long range predictability and is the Achilles' heel of the current seamless prediction suites(5-7).","[Cassou, Christophe] CERFACS, CNRS, Global Change & Climate Modelling Project, F-31057 Toulouse, France","Cassou, C (reprint author), CERFACS, CNRS, Global Change & Climate Modelling Project, 42 Ave G Coriolis, F-31057 Toulouse, France.",cassou@cerfacs.fr,,,CNRS; European Union's Sixth Framework Programme ( DYNAMITE and ENSEMBLES),"The author wishes to thank L.

Although there would have been considerable economic and nutritional gains from using these animals for their milk and other products from living animals - that is, traction and wool - the first clear evidence for these appears much later, from the late fifth and fourth millennia BC(4,5). Hence, the timing and region in which milking was first practised remain unknown. Organic residues preserved in archaeological pottery(6,7) have provided direct evidence for the use of milk in the fourth millennium in Britain(7-9), and in the sixth millennium in eastern Europe(10), based on the delta(13)C values of the major fatty acids of milk fat(6,7). Here we apply this approach to more than 2,200 pottery vessels from sites in the Near East and southeastern Europe dating from the fifth to the seventh millennia BC. We show that milk was in use by the seventh millennium; this is the earliest direct evidence to date. Milking was particularly important in northwestern Anatolia, pointing to regional differences linked with conditions more favourable to cattle compared to other regions, where sheep and goats were relatively common and milk use less important. The latter is supported by correlations between the fat type and animal bone evidence.","[Evershed, Richard P.; Copley, Mark S.] Univ Bristol, Sch Chem, Organ Geochem Unit, Bristol Biogeochem Res Ctr, Bristol BS8 1TS, Avon, England; [Payne, Sebastian] English Heritage, London EC1N 2ST, England; [Sherratt, Andrew G.] Univ Sheffield, Dept Archaeol, Sheffield S10 2TN, S Yorkshire, England; [Coolidge, Jennifer] Univ Oxford, Archaeol & Hist Art Res Lab, Oxford OX1 3QJ, England; [Urem-Kotsu, Duska; Kotsakis, Kostas] Aristotle Univ Thessaloniki, Dept Archaeol, Thessaloniki 54124, Greece; [Ozdogan, Mehmet; Ozbasaran, Mihriban; Bicakci, Erhan] Istanbul Univ, Prehist Dept, TR-34134 Istanbul, Turkey; [Ozdogan, Asly E.] Canakkale Onsekiz Mart Univ, Dept Archaeol, TR-17020 Canakkale, Turkey; [Nieuwenhuyse, Olivier; Akkermans, Peter M.

The 1918 H1N1 influenza virus pandemic was the most severe of the modern era(1). Recent work has recovered the gene sequences of this unusual strain(2), so that the 1918 pandemic virus could be reconstituted to display its unique virulence phenotypes(3,4). However, little is known about adaptive immunity to this virus. We took advantage of the 1918 virus sequencing and the resultant production of recombinant 1918 haemagglutinin ( HA) protein antigen to characterize at the clonal level neutralizing antibodies induced by natural exposure of survivors to the 1918 pandemic virus. Here we show that of the 32 individuals tested that were born in or before 1915, each showed seroreactivity with the 1918 virus, nearly 90 years after the pandemic. Seven of the eight donor samples tested had circulating B cells that secreted antibodies that bound the 1918 HA. We isolated B cells from subjects and generated five monoclonal antibodies that showed potent neutralizing activity against 1918 virus from three separate donors. These antibodies also cross- reacted with the genetically similar HA of a 1930 swine H1N1 influenza strain, but did not cross- react with HAs of more contemporary human influenza viruses. The antibody genes had an unusually high degree of somatic mutation. The antibodies bound to the 1918 HA protein with high affinity, had exceptional virus- neutralizing potency and protected mice from lethal infection. Isolation of viruses that escaped inhibition suggested that the antibodies recognize classical antigenic sites on the HA surface. Thus, these studies demonstrate that survivors of the 1918 influenza pandemic possess highly functional, virus- neutralizing antibodies to this uniquely virulent virus, and that humans can sustain circulating B memory cells to viruses for many decades after exposure - well into the tenth decade of life.","[Yu, Xiaocong; McGraw, Patricia A.; House, Frances S.; Keefer, Christopher J.; Hicar, Mark D.; Crowe, James E., Jr.] Vanderbilt Univ, Med Ctr, Dept Pediat, Nashville, TN 37232 USA; [Yu, Xiaocong; McGraw, Patricia A.; House, Frances S.; Keefer, Christopher J.; Hicar, Mark D.; Crowe, James E., Jr.] Vanderbilt Univ, Med Ctr, Dept Microbiol & Immunol, Nashville, TN 37232 USA; [Tsibane, Tshidi; Pappas, Claudia; Martinez, Osvaldo; Aguilar, Patricia V.; Basler, Christopher F.] Mt Sinai Sch Med, Dept Microbiol, New York, NY 10029 USA; [Tumpey, Terrence M.; Pappas, Claudia; Perrone, Lucy A.; Stevens, James] Ctr Dis Control & Prevent, Influenza Div, Atlanta, GA 30333 USA; [Stevens, James; Wilson, Ian A.] Scripps Res Inst, Dept Mol Biol, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; [Stevens, James; Wilson, Ian A.] Scripps Res Inst, Skaggs Inst Chem Biol, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; [Altschuler, Eric L.] Univ Med & Dent New Jersey, Dept Phys Med & Rehabil, Newark, NJ 07103 USA","Crowe, JE (reprint author), Vanderbilt Univ, Med Ctr, Dept Pediat, Nashville, TN 37232 USA.",altschel@umdnj.edu; Chris.Basler@mssm.edu; James.Crowe@vanderbilt.edu,"Crowe, James/B-5549-2009","Crowe, James/0000-0002-0049-1079; Martinez, Osvaldo/0000-0001-7335-4342","University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey; Institute for the Elimination of Health Disparities; National Institutes of Health [U54 AI057157, CA55896, AI42266]; Southeast Regional Center of Excellence for Emerging Infections and Biodefense [U19 AI057229]; Northeast Biodefense Center [U54 AI57158, U19 AI62623, AI057158]; Center for Investigating Viral Immunity and Antagonism [P01AI058113)]","We thank L.

Loss of hair cells and their innervating neurons is the most frequent cause of hearing impairment(3). Atonal homologue 1 ( encoded by Atoh1, also known as Math1) is a basic helix - loop - helix transcription factor required for hair- cell development(4-6), and its misexpression in vitro(7,8) and in vivo(9,10) generates hair- cell- like cells. Atoh1- based gene therapy to ameliorate auditory(10) and vestibular(11) dysfunction has been proposed. However, the biophysical properties of putative hair cells induced by Atoh1 misexpression have not been characterized. Here we show that in utero gene transfer of Atoh1 produces functional supernumerary hair cells in the mouse cochlea. The induced hair cells display stereociliary bundles, attract neuronal processes and express the ribbon synapse marker carboxyterminal binding protein 2 ( refs 12,13). Moreover, the hair cells are capable of mechanoelectrical transduction(1,2) and show basolateral conductances with age- appropriate specializations. Our results demonstrate that manipulation of cell fate by transcription factor misexpression produces functional sensory cells in the postnatal mammalian cochlea. We expect that our in utero gene transfer paradigm will enable the design and validation of gene therapies to ameliorate hearing loss in mouse models of human deafness(14,15).","[Gubbels, Samuel P.; Woessner, David W.; Brigande, John V.] Oregon Hlth & Sci Univ, Oregon Hearing Res Ctr, Dept Otolaryngol, Portland, OR 97239 USA; [Mitchell, John C.] Oregon Hlth & Sci Univ, Dept Restorat Dent, Div Biomat & Biomech, Sch Dent, Portland, OR 97239 USA; [Ricci, Anthony J.] Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Dept Otolaryngol Head & Neck Surg, Stanford, CA 94305 USA","Brigande, JV (reprint author), Oregon Hlth & Sci Univ, Oregon Hearing Res Ctr, Dept Otolaryngol, 3181 SW Sam Jackson Pk Rd, Portland, OR 97239 USA.",brigande@ohsu.edu,,,National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders; McKnight Endowment Fund for Neuroscience; American Otological Society,"We thank C.

In newborn rats, FcRn transfers IgG from milk to blood by apical-to-basolateral transcytosis across intestinal epithelial cells. The pH difference between the apical ( pH 6.0-6.5) and basolateral ( pH 7.4) sides of intestinal epithelial cells facilitates the efficient unidirectional transport of IgG, because FcRn binds IgG at pH 6.0-6.5 but not at pH 7 or more(1,2). As milk passes through the neonatal intestine, maternal IgG is removed by FcRn-expressing cells in the proximal small intestine ( duodenum and jejunum); remaining proteins are absorbed and degraded by FcRn- negative cells in the distal small intestine ( ileum)(3-6). Here we use electron tomography to make jejunal transcytosis visible directly in space and time, developing new labelling and detection methods to map individual nanogold-labelled Fc within transport vesicles(7) and simultaneously to characterize these vesicles by immunolabelling. Combining electron tomography with a nonperturbing endocytic label allowed us to conclusively identify receptor- bound ligands, resolve interconnecting vesicles, determine whether a vesicle was microtubule- associated, and accurately trace FcRn- mediated transport of IgG. Our results present a complex picture in which Fc moves through networks of entangled tubular and irregular vesicles, only some of which are microtubuleassociated, as it migrates to the basolateral surface. New features of transcytosis are elucidated, including transport involving multivesicular body inner vesicles/ tubules and exocytosis through clathrin- coated pits. Markers for early, late and recycling endosomes each labelled vesicles in different and overlapping morphological classes, revealing spatial complexity in endo- lysosomal trafficking.","[He, Wanzhong; Huey-Tubman, Kathryn E.; Jensen, Grant J.; Bjorkman, Pamela J.] CALTECH, Div Biol 114 96, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA; [Huey-Tubman, Kathryn E.; Bjorkman, Pamela J.] CALTECH, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA; [He, Wanzhong] Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Biol Sci, Singapore 117543, Singapore; [Ladinsky, Mark S.; McIntosh, J.

Although dysregulated beta-catenin activity drives colon tumorigenesis, further genetic perturbations are required to elaborate full malignant transformation(3). To identify genes that both modulate beta-catenin activity and are essential for colon cancer cell proliferation, we conducted two loss-of-function screens in human colon cancer cells and compared genes identified in these screens with an analysis of copy number alterations in colon cancer specimens. One of these genes, CDK8, which encodes a member of the mediator complex(4), is located at 13q12.13, a region of recurrent copy number gain in a substantial fraction of colon cancers. Here we show that the suppression of CDK8 expression inhibits proliferation in colon cancer cells characterized by high levels of CDK8 and beta-catenin hyperactivity. CDK8 kinase activity was necessary for beta-catenin-driven transformation and for expression of several beta-catenin transcriptional targets. Together these observations suggest that therapeutic interventions targeting CDK8 may confer a clinical benefit in beta-catenin-driven malignancies.","[Firestein, Ron; Bass, Adam J.; Kim, So Young; Dunn, Ian F.; Guney, Isil; Freed, Ellen; Vena, Natalie; Ogino, Shuji; Chheda, Milan G.; Shrestha, Yashaswi; Jain, Supriya; Bojarski, Emeric; Mermel, Craig; Barretina, Jordi; Fuchs, Charles S.; Loda, Massimo; Shivdasani, Ramesh A.; Meyerson, Matthew; Hahn, William C.] Dana Farber Canc Inst, Dept Med Oncol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Firestein, Ron; Ligon, Azra H.; Ogino, Shuji; Finn, Stephen; Chan, Jennifer A.; Loda, Massimo; Meyerson, Matthew] Brigham & Womens Hosp, Dept Pathol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Bass, Adam J.; Kim, So Young; Shivdasani, Ramesh A.; Hahn, William C.] Brigham & Womens Hosp, Dept Med, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Dunn, Ian F.] Brigham & Womens Hosp, Dept Neurosurg, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Firestein, Ron; Bass, Adam J.; Kim, So Young; Dunn, Ian F.; Guney, Isil; Freed, Ellen; Ligon, Azra H.; Vena, Natalie; Ogino, Shuji; Chheda, Milan G.; Finn, Stephen; Shrestha, Yashaswi; Jain, Supriya; Bojarski, Emeric; Mermel, Craig; Barretina, Jordi; Chan, Jennifer A.; Fuchs, Charles S.; Loda, Massimo; Shivdasani, Ramesh A.; Meyerson, Matthew; Hahn, William C.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Chheda, Milan G.] Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Dept Neurooncol, Boston, MA 02114 USA; [Firestein, Ron; Bass, Adam J.; Kim, So Young; Dunn, Ian F.; Guney, Isil; Shrestha, Yashaswi; Mermel, Craig; Barretina, Jordi; Root, David E.; Fuchs, Charles S.] Dana Farber Canc Inst, Ctr Canc Genome Discovery, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Firestein, Ron; Bass, Adam J.; Kim, So Young; Dunn, Ian F.; Silver, Serena J.; Guney, Isil; Chheda, Milan G.; Tamayo, Pablo; Shrestha, Yashaswi; Boehm, Jesse S.; Mermel, Craig; Barretina, Jordi; Chan, Jennifer A.; Root, David E.; Meyerson, Matthew; Hahn, William C.] Broad Inst Harvard & MIT, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; [Baselga, Jose; Tabernero, Josep] Hosp Gen Valle Hebron, Dept Med Oncol, Barcelona 08035, Spain","Hahn, WC (reprint author), Dana Farber Canc Inst, Dept Med Oncol, 44 Binney St, Boston, MA 02115 USA.",william_hahn@dfci.harvard.edu,"Meyerson, Matthew/E-7123-2012","Finn, Stephen/0000-0002-8628-5814","US NCI/NIH [R33CA128625]; NIH [T32]; GI SPORE Career Development [P50CA127003]; Harvard-MIT Clinical Investigator Training Program Fellowship; Department of Defense Prostate Cancer Postdoctoral Fellowships; Warren-Whitman- Richardson, Hagerty Foundation Research Fellowships; K12 award","We thank E.

Here we show that E2F1 is a potent and specific inhibitor of beta-catenin/T-cell factor (TCF)- dependent transcription, and that this function contributes to E2F1- induced apoptosis. E2F1 deregulation suppresses beta-catenin activity in an adenomatous polyposis coli ( APC)/glycogen synthase kinase- 3 ( GSK3)- independent manner, reducing the expression of key beta-catenin targets including c- MYC. This interaction explains why colorectal tumours, which depend on beta- catenin transcription for their abnormal proliferation, keep RB1 intact. Remarkably, E2F1 activity is also repressed by cyclin- dependent kinase- 8 ( CDK8), a colorectal oncoprotein(1). Elevated levels of CDK8 protect beta-catenin/TCF-dependent transcription from inhibition by E2F1. Thus, by retaining RB1 and amplifying CDK8, colorectal tumour cells select conditions that collectively suppress E2F1 and enhance the activity of beta-catenin.","[Morris, Erick J.; Ji, Jun-Yuan; Yang, Fajun; Di Stefano, Luisa; Herr, Anabel; Moon, Nam-Sung; Haigis, Kevin M.; Naar, Anders M.; Dyson, Nicholas J.] Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Ctr Canc, Mol Oncol Lab, Charlestown, MA 02129 USA; [Morris, Erick J.; Ji, Jun-Yuan; Yang, Fajun; Di Stefano, Luisa; Herr, Anabel; Moon, Nam-Sung; Haigis, Kevin M.; Naar, Anders M.; Dyson, Nicholas J.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Charlestown, MA 02129 USA; [Yang, Fajun; Naar, Anders M.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Cell Biol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Kwon, Eun-Jeong] Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Boston, MA 02114 USA; [Kwon, Eun-Jeong] Vincent Ctr Reprod Biol, Boston, MA 02114 USA; [Haigis, Kevin M.] Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Ctr Canc, Lab Mol Pathol, Charlestown, MA 02129 USA","Dyson, NJ (reprint author), Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Ctr Canc, Mol Oncol Lab, 13th St,Bldg 149, Charlestown, MA 02129 USA.",dyson@helix.mgh.harvard.edu,,"Moon, Nam-Sung/0000-0002-0455-927X","Ruth L.

The mechanisms preventing origin firing on newly replicated DNA are well documented(1), but much less is known about the mechanisms controlling the spacing of initiation events 2,3, namely the completion of DNA replication. Here we show that origin use in Chinese hamster cells depends on both the movement of the replication forks and the organization of chromatin loops. We found that slowing the replication speed triggers the recruitment of latent origins within minutes, allowing the completion of S phase in a timely fashion. When slowly replicating cells are shifted to conditions of fast fork progression, although the decrease in the overall number of active origins occurs within 2 h, the cells still have to go through a complete cell cycle before the efficiency specific to each origin is restored. We observed a strict correlation between replication speed during a given S phase and the size of chromatin loops in the next G1 phase. Furthermore, we found that origins located at or near sites of anchorage of chromatin loops in G1 are activated preferentially in the following S phase. These data suggest a mechanism of origin programming in which replication speed determines the spacing of anchorage regions of chromatin loops, that, in turn, controls the choice of initiation sites.","[Courbet, Sylvain; Gay, Sophie; Arnoult, Nausica; Wronka, Gerd; Anglana, Mauro; Brison, Olivier; Debatisse, Michelle] Inst Curie, F-75248 Paris, France; [Courbet, Sylvain; Gay, Sophie; Arnoult, Nausica; Wronka, Gerd; Anglana, Mauro; Brison, Olivier; Debatisse, Michelle] Univ Paris 06, UPMC, F-75005 Paris, France; [Courbet, Sylvain; Gay, Sophie; Arnoult, Nausica; Wronka, Gerd; Anglana, Mauro; Brison, Olivier; Debatisse, Michelle] CNRS, UMR 7147, F-75700 Paris, France","Debatisse, M (reprint author), Inst Curie, 26 Rue Ulm, F-75248 Paris, France.",michelle.debatisse@curie.fr,,"Arnoult, Nausica/0000-0003-2633-0270",ARC; Ministere de la Recherche; La Ligue Nationale contre le Cancer; Agence Nationale de la Recherche,"We thank E.

Here we show that mouse embryonic stem cells, cultured without any morphogen but in the presence of a sonic hedgehog inhibitor, recapitulate in vitro the major milestones of cortical development, leading to the sequential generation of a diverse repertoire of neurons that display most salient features of genuine cortical pyramidal neurons. When grafted into the cerebral cortex, these neurons develop patterns of axonal projections corresponding to a wide range of cortical layers, but also to highly specific cortical areas, in particular visual and limbic areas, thereby demonstrating that the identity of a cortical area can be specified without any influence from the brain. The discovery of intrinsic corticogenesis sheds new light on the mechanisms of neuronal specification, and opens new avenues for the modelling and treatment of brain diseases.","[Gaspard, Nicolas; Bouschet, Tristan; Dimidschstein, Jordane; Naeije, Gilles; van den Ameele, Jelle; Espuny-Camacho, Ira; Herpoel, Adele; Passante, Lara; Vanderhaeghen, Pierre] Univ Libre Bruxelles, IRIBHN, Inst Interdisciplinary Res, B-1070 Brussels, Belgium; [Hourez, Raphael; Schiffmann, Serge N.] Univ Libre Bruxelles, Neurophysiol Lab, B-1070 Brussels, Belgium; [Gaillard, Afsaneh] Univ Poitiers, CNRS, Inst Physiol & Biol Cellulaires, F-86022 Poitiers, France","Vanderhaeghen, P (reprint author), Univ Libre Bruxelles, IRIBHN, Inst Interdisciplinary Res, 808 Route Lennik, B-1070 Brussels, Belgium.",pierre.vanderhaeghen@ulb.ac.be,,"van den Ameele, Jelle/0000-0002-2744-0810; Bouschet, Tristan/0000-0002-7858-6115; Schiffmann, Serge/0000-0002-0118-9816","Belgian FNRS, the Action de Recherches Concertees (ARC) Programs; Interuniversity Attraction Poles Program (IUAP); Belgian State; Federal Office; Walloon Region Excellence Program CIBLES; Belgian Queen Elizabeth Medical Foundation; UCB Neuroscience Award; Tournesol FNRS/CNRS Program; Televie; Marie Curie Grant; Research Fellows of the FNRS","We thank G.

Although allene oxide synthase ( AOS) and hydroperoxide lyase are atypical cytochrome P450 family members involved in the synthesis of jasmonates and GLVs, respectively, it is unknown how these enzymes rearrange their hydroperoxide substrates into different products. Here we present the crystal structures of Arabidopsis thaliana AOS, free and in complex with substrate or intermediate analogues. The structures reveal an unusual active site poised to control the reactivity of an epoxyallylic radical and its cation by means of interactions with an aromatic pi- system. Replacing the amino acid involved in these steps by a non- polar residue markedly reduces AOS activity and, unexpectedly, is both necessary and sufficient for converting AOS into a GLV biosynthetic enzyme. Furthermore, by combining our structural data with bioinformatic and biochemical analyses, we have discovered previously unknown hydroperoxide lyase in plant growth- promoting rhizobacteria, AOS in coral, and epoxyalcohol synthase in amphioxus. These results indicate that oxylipin biosynthetic genes were present in the last common ancestor of plants and animals, but were subsequently lost in all metazoan lineages except Placozoa, Cnidaria and Cephalochordata.","[Lee, Dong-Sun; Raman, C.

One example of the similarities between these two types of systems is the characteristic rapid X- ray variability seen from the accretion flow(1). The power spectrum of this variability in black hole binaries consists of a broad noise with multiple quasi- periodic oscillations superimposed on it. Although the broad noise component has been observed in many active galactic nuclei(2,3), there have hitherto been no significant detections of quasi- periodic oscillations(4-6). Here we report the discovery of an similar to 1- hour X- ray periodicity in a bright active galaxy, RE J1034+396. The signal is highly statistically significant ( at the 5.6 sigma level) and very coherent, with quality factorQ > 16.

There are open questions about the number of distinct phases and the possible presence of a quantum- critical point underneath the superconducting dome(3-5). The picture has remained unclear because there has not been conclusive evidence for a new type of order. Neutron scattering measurements for YBa(2)Cu(3)O(6+delta) (YBCO) resulted in contradictory claims of no(6,7) and weak(8,9) magnetic order, and the interpretation of muon spin relaxation measurements on YBCO(10,11) and of circularly polarized photoemission experiments on Bi(2)Sr(2)CaCu(2)O(8+delta) ( refs 12, 13) has been controversial. Here we use polarized neutron diffraction to demonstrate for the model superconductor HgBa(2)CuO(4+delta) (Hg1201) that the characteristic temperature T* marks the onset of an unusual magnetic order. Together with recent results for YBCO(14,15), this observation constitutes a demonstration of the universal existence of such a state. The findings appear to rule out theories that regard T* as a crossover temperature(16-18) rather than a phase transition temperature(19-21). Instead, they are consistent with a variant of previously proposed charge- current- loop order(19,20) that involves apical oxygen orbitals(22), and with the notion that many of the unusual properties arise from the presence of a quantum- critical point(3-5,19).","[Barisic, N.; Cho, Y.; Zhao, X.; Greven, M.] Stanford Synchrotron Radiat Lab, Stanford, CA 94309 USA; [Li, Y.; Yu, G.] Stanford Univ, Dept Phys, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Baledent, V.; Fauque, B.; Sidis, Y.; Bourges, P.] CEA Saclay, CNRS, Leon Brillouin Lab, F-91191 Gif Sur Yvette, France; [Barisic, N.] Univ Stuttgart, Inst Phys 1, D-70550 Stuttgart, Germany; [Cho, Y.] Pusan Natl Univ, BK21 Team Nano Fus Technol, Pusan 609735, South Korea; [Zhao, X.] Jilin Univ, State Key Lab Inorgan Synth & Preparat Chem, Coll Chem, Changchun 130012, Peoples R China; [Greven, M.] Stanford Univ, Dept Appl Phys, Stanford, CA 94305 USA","Greven, M (reprint author), Stanford Synchrotron Radiat Lab, Stanford, CA 94309 USA.",greven@stanford.edu,"Yu, Guichuan/K-4025-2014; Barisic, Neven/E-4246-2015",,US Department of Energy; National Science Foundation,We thank H.

Negative- index metamaterials (NIMs) were first demonstrated for microwave frequencies(5,6), but it has been challenging to design NIMs for optical frequencies and they have so far been limited to optically thin samples because of significant fabrication challenges and strong energy dissipation in metals(7,8). Such thin structures are analogous to a monolayer of atoms, making it difficult to assign bulk properties such as the index of refraction. Negative refraction of surface plasmons was recently demonstrated but was confined to a two- dimensional waveguide(9). Three- dimensional ( 3D) optical metamaterials have come into focus recently, including the realization of negative refraction by using layered semiconductor metamaterials and a 3D magnetic metamaterial in the infrared frequencies; however, neither of these had a negative index of refraction(10,11). Here we report a 3D optical metamaterial having negative refractive index with a very high figure of merit of 3.5 ( that is, low loss). This metamaterial is made of cascaded 'fishnet' structures, with a negative index existing over a broad spectral range. Moreover, it can readily be probed from free space, making it functional for optical devices. We construct a prism made of this optical NIM to demonstrate negative refractive index at optical frequencies, resulting unambiguously from the negative phase evolution of the wave propagating inside the metamaterial. Bulk optical metamaterials open up prospects for studies of 3D optical effects and applications associated with NIMs and zero-index materials such as reversed Doppler effect, superlenses, optical tunnelling devices(12,13), compact resonators and highly directional sources(14).","[Valentine, Jason; Zhang, Shuang; Zentgraf, Thomas; Ulin-Avila, Erick; Genov, Dentcho A.; Bartal, Guy; Zhang, Xiang] Univ Calif Berkeley, NSF Nanoscale Sci & Engn Ctr NSEC, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Zhang, Xiang] Univ Calif Berkeley, Lawrence Berkeley Lab, Div Sci Mat, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA","Zhang, X (reprint author), Univ Calif Berkeley, NSF Nanoscale Sci & Engn Ctr NSEC, 3112 Etcheverry Hall, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",xiang@berkeley.edu,"zhang, shuang/G-5224-2011; ulin-avila, erick/M-3278-2014; Zentgraf, Thomas/G-8848-2013; Valentine, Jason/A-6121-2012","Zentgraf, Thomas/0000-0002-8662-1101; ",US Army Research Office (ARO) MURI programme [50432-PH-MUR]; NSF Nano-scale Science and Engineering Center [DMI-0327077]; Alexander von Humboldt Foundation; Office of Science; Office of Basic Energy Sciences; US Department of Energy [DE-AC02-05CH11231],"We acknowledge funding support from US Army Research Office (ARO) MURI programme 50432-PH-MUR and partly by the NSF Nano-scale Science and Engineering Center DMI-0327077.

Once symmetry is broken and a handedness is established, biochemical pathways are set. In DNA, the double helix arises from the existence of two competing length scales, one set by the distance between monomers in the sugar backbone, and the other set by the stacking of the base pairs(1). Here we use a colloidal system to explore a simple forcing route to chiral structures. To do so we have designed magnetic colloids that, depending on both their shape and induced magnetization, self- assemble with controlled helicity. We model the two length scales with asymmetric colloidal dumbbells linked by a magnetic belt at their waist. In the presence of a magnetic field the belts assemble into a chain and the steric constraints imposed by the asymmetric spheres force the chain to coil. We show that if the size ratio between the spheres is large enough, a single helicity is adopted, right or left. The realization of chiral colloidal clusters opens up a new link between colloidal science and chemistry. These colloidal clusters may also find use as mesopolymers, as optical and light- activated structures(2), and as models for enantiomeric separation.","[Zerrouki, D.; Baudry, J.; Bibette, J.] UPMC, CNRS, ESPCI, Lab Colloides & Mat Divises, F-75005 Paris, France; [Pine, D.; Chaikin, P.] NYU, Dept Phys, Ctr Soft Matter Res, New York, NY 10003 USA","Bibette, J (reprint author), UPMC, CNRS, ESPCI, Lab Colloides & Mat Divises, 10 Rue Vauquelin, F-75005 Paris, France.",jerome.bibette@espci.fr,"Baudry, Jean/A-7344-2016; Pine, David/B-7740-2016","Baudry, Jean/0000-0002-5526-499X; Pine, David/0000-0002-3304-6684",,,,15,208,210,8,151,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,18-Sep,2008,455,7211,,,,,380,382,,10.1038/nature07237,,3,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,349EX,WOS:000259265200042,18800136,No,Y,N,11/20/17

Global(1,3-5) and site-specific(6) data sets have demonstrated that climate and climate variability influence biogeochemical processes that determine net ecosystem carbon dioxide exchange (NEE) at multiple timescales. Experimental data necessary to quantify impacts of a single climate variable, such as temperature anomalies, on NEE and carbon sequestration of ecosystems at interannual timescales have been lacking. This derives from an inability of field studies to avoid the confounding effects of natural intra- annual and interannual variability in temperature and precipitation. Here we present results from a four-year study using replicate 12,000-kg intact tallgrass prairie monoliths located in four 184-m(3) enclosed lysimeters(7). We exposed 6 of 12 monoliths to an anomalously warm year in the second year of the study(8) and continuously quantified rates of ecosystem processes, including NEE. We find that warming decreases NEE in both the extreme year and the following year by inducing drought that suppresses net primary productivity in the extreme year and by stimulating heterotrophic respiration of soil biota in the subsequent year. Our data indicate that two years are required for NEE in the previously warmed experimental ecosystems to recover to levels measured in the control ecosystems. This time lag caused net ecosystem carbon sequestration in previously warmed ecosystems to be decreased threefold over the study period, compared with control ecosystems. Our findings suggest that more frequent anomalously warm years(9), a possible consequence of increasing anthropogenic carbon dioxide levels(10), may lead to a sustained decrease in carbon dioxide uptake by terrestrial ecosystems.","[Arnone, John A., III; Verburg, Paul S.

A recent addition to such knowledge is that the carbon/nitrogen ratio of inorganic consumption and release of dissolved organic matter may increase in a high-CO2 world(1). This will, however, yield a negative feedback on atmospheric CO2 only if the extra organic material escapes mineralization within the photic zone. Here we show, in the context of an Arctic pelagic ecosystem, how the fate and effects of added degradable organic carbon depend critically on the state of the microbial food web. When bacterial growth rate was limited by mineral nutrients, extra organic carbon accumulated in the system. When bacteria were limited by organic carbon, however, addition of labile dissolved organic carbon reduced phytoplankton biomass and activity and also the rate at which total organic carbon accumulated, explained as the result of stimulated bacterial competition for mineral nutrients. This counterintuitive 'more organic carbon gives less organic carbon' effect was particularly pronounced in diatom- dominated systems where the carbon/ mineral nutrient ratio in phytoplankton production was high. Our results highlight how descriptions of present and future states of the oceanic carbon cycle require detailed understanding of the stoichiometric coupling between carbon and growth- limiting mineral nutrients in both autotrophic and heterotrophic processes.","[Thingstad, T.

Upon attachment to the cell, the virus induces robust inflammatory, interferon- and growth- factor-like signalling(2-9). The mechanisms facilitating viral entry and gene expression are not clearly understood(4). Here we show that platelet- derived growth factor-alpha receptor (PDGFR-alpha) is specifically phosphorylated by both laboratory and clinical isolates of HCMV in various human cell types, resulting in activation of the phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI(3)K) signalling pathway. Upon stimulation by HCMV, tyrosine- phosphorylated PDGFR-alpha associated with the p85 regulatory subunit of PI( 3) K and induced protein kinase B ( also known as Akt) phosphorylation, similar to the genuine ligand, PDGF-AA. Cells in which PDGFR-alpha was genetically deleted(10) or functionally blocked were non- permissive to HCMV entry, viral gene expression or infectious virus production. Re- introducing human PDGFRA gene into knockout cells restored susceptibility to viral entry and essential viral gene expression. Blockade of receptor function with a humanized PDGFR-alpha blocking antibody (IMC-3G3)(11) or targeted inhibition of its kinase activity with a small molecule (Gleevec)(12) completely inhibited HCMV viral internalization and gene expression in human epithelial, endothelial and fibroblast cells. Viral entry in cells harbouring endogenous PDGFR-alpha was competitively inhibited by pretreatment with PDGF-AA. We further demonstrate that HCMV glycoprotein B directly interacts with PDGFR-alpha, resulting in receptor tyrosine phosphorylation, and that glycoprotein B neutralizing antibodies(13) inhibit HCMV- induced PDGFR-alpha phosphorylation. Taken together, these data indicate that PDGFR-alpha is a critical receptor required for HCMV infection, and thus a target for novel anti- viral therapies.","[Soroceanu, Liliana; Akhavan, Armin; Cobbs, Charles S.] Calif Pacific Med Ctr, Res Inst, Dept Neurosci, San Francisco, CA 94107 USA; [Cobbs, Charles S.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Neurol Surg, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA","Cobbs, CS (reprint author), Calif Pacific Med Ctr, Res Inst, Dept Neurosci, Suite 220,475 Brannan St, San Francisco, CA 94107 USA.",charles.cobbs@gmail.com,,,California Pacific Medical Center Research Institute; Arthur Flaming Foundation,"We thank M.

Whereas haematopoietic antigen- presenting cells generate MHC- II - peptide complexes predominantly through the processing of endocytosed polypeptides(1), it remains unknown if and how TECs use unconventional pathways of antigen presentation. Here we address the role of macroautophagy, a process that has recently been shown to allow for endogenous MHC II loading(2-6), in T- cell repertoire selection in the mouse thymus. In contrast to most other tissues, TECs had a high constitutive level of autophagy. Genetic interference with autophagy specifically in TECs led to altered selection of certain MHC-II-restricted T- cell specificities and resulted in severe colitis and multi- organ inflammation. Our findings indicate that autophagy focuses the MHC- II - peptide repertoire of TECs on their intracellular milieu, which notably comprises a wide array of otherwise strictly 'tissue-specific' self antigens(7,8). In doing so, it contributes to T- cell selection and is essential for the generation of a self- tolerant T- cell repertoire.","[Nedjic, Jelena; Aichinger, Martin; Emmerich, Jan; Klein, Ludger] Res Inst Mol Pathol, A-1030 Vienna, Austria; [Mizushima, Noboru] Tokyo Med & Dent Univ, Dept Physiol & Cell Biol, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo 1138613, Japan; [Klein, Ludger] Univ Munich, Inst Immunol, D-80336 Munich, Germany","Klein, L (reprint author), Res Inst Mol Pathol, Dr Bohr Gasse 7, A-1030 Vienna, Austria.",ludger.klein@med.lmu.de,"Mizushima, Noboru/C-3635-2009; Klein, Ludger/G-8785-2011","Mizushima, Noboru/0000-0002-6258-6444; ","Austrian National Science Fund [F023, Z58-B01]; European Union; FP6 Integrated Project Eurothymaide [LSHB-CT-2003-503410]; Boehringer Ingelheim","We acknowledge support from the Austrian National Science Fund (Sonderforschungsbereich F023 and grant Z58-B01 'Wittgenstein Prize Meinrad Busslinger'; to J.N. and L.

However, hundreds of different human cell lines from embryonic, fetal and adult sources have been called stem cells, even though they range from pluripotent cells - typified by embryonic stem cells, which are capable of virtually unlimited proliferation and differentiation - to adult stem cell lines, which can generate a far more limited repertoire of differentiated cell types. The rapid increase in reports of new sources of stem cells and their anticipated value to regenerative medicine(1,2) has highlighted the need for a general, reproducible method for classification of these cells(3). We report here the creation and analysis of a database of global gene expression profiles ( which we call the 'stem cell matrix') that enables the classification of cultured human stem cells in the context of a wide variety of pluripotent, multipotent and differentiated cell types. Using an unsupervised clustering method(4,5) to categorize a collection of similar to 150 cell samples, we discovered that pluripotent stem cell lines group together, whereas other cell types, including brain-derived neural stem cell lines, are very diverse. Using further bioinformatic analysis(6) we uncovered a protein - protein network (PluriNet) that is shared by the pluripotent cells ( embryonic stem cells, embryonal carcinomas and induced pluripotent cells). Analysis of published data showed that the PluriNet seems to be a common characteristic of pluripotent cells, including mouse embryonic stem and induced pluripotent cells and human oocytes. Our results offer a new strategy for classifying stem cells and support the idea that pluripotency and self- renewal are under tight control by specific molecular networks.","[Mueller, Franz-Josef; Laurent, Louise C.; Lu, Christina; Loring, Jeanne F.] Scripps Res Inst, Ctr Regenerat Med, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; [Mueller, Franz-Josef] Univ Hosp Schleswig Holstein, Ctr Psychiat, ZIP Kiel, D-24105 Kiel, Germany; [Laurent, Louise C.] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Reprod Med, San Diego, CA 92035 USA; [Kostka, Dennis] Max Planck Inst Mol Genet, Dept Computat Mol Biol, D-14195 Berlin, Germany; [Ulitsky, Igor; Shamir, Ron] Tel Aviv Univ, Sch Comp Sci, IL-69978 Tel Aviv, Israel; [Williams, Roy; Loring, Jeanne F.] Burnham Inst, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; [Park, In-Hyun] Childrens Hosp, Div Pediat Hematol Oncol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Park, In-Hyun] Dana Farber Canc Inst, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Rao, Mahendra S.] Invitrogen Co, Frederick, MD 21704 USA; [Rao, Mahendra S.] Buck Inst Aging, Ctr Stem Cell Biol, Novato, CA 94945 USA; [Schwartz, Philip H.] Childrens Hosp Orange Cty, Res Inst, Ctr Res Neurosci, Orange, CA 92868 USA; [Schwartz, Philip H.] Univ Calif Irvine, Ctr Dev Biol, Irvine, CA 92697 USA; [Schmidt, Nils O.] Univ Med Ctr Hamburg Eppendorf, Dept Neurosurg, D-20246 Hamburg, Germany","Muller, FJ (reprint author), Scripps Res Inst, Ctr Regenerat Med, 10550 N Torrey Pines Rd, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA.",fj.mueller@zip-kiel.de; jloring@scripps.edu,"MAller, Franz-Josef/E-3336-2010; Ulitsky, Igor/D-4828-2009; Schmidt, Nils Ole/D-5696-2014","Williams, Roy/0000-0002-5442-9166; Ulitsky, Igor/0000-0003-0555-6561; Loring, Jeanne/0000-0001-6226-9767",Christian- Abrechts University Young Investigator Award; Hamburger Krebsgesellschaft Grant; Edmond J.

Here we show that, although previous reports have described a cell- autonomous role for Hh signalling in these tumours(1-7), Hh ligands fail to activate signalling in tumour epithelial cells. In contrast, our data support ligand- dependent activation of the Hh pathway in the stromal microenvironment. Specific inhibition of Hh signalling using small molecule inhibitors, a neutralizing anti- Hh antibody or genetic deletion of smoothened ( Smo) in the mouse stroma results in growth inhibition in xenograft tumour models. Taken together, these studies demonstrate a paracrine requirement for Hh ligand signalling in the tumorigenesis of Hh- expressing cancers and have important implications for the development of Hh pathway antagonists in cancer.","[Yauch, Robert L.; Gould, Stephen E.; Scales, Suzie J.; Tang, Tracy; Tian, Hua; Ahn, Christina P.; Marshall, Derek; Fu, Ling; Januario, Thomas; Kallop, Dara; Nannini-Pepe, Michelle; Marsters, James C., Jr.; de Sauvage, Frederic J.] Genentech Inc, San Francisco, CA 94080 USA; [Kotkow, Karen; Rubin, Lee L.] Curis Inc, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA","de Sauvage, FJ (reprint author), Genentech Inc, 1 DNA Way, San Francisco, CA 94080 USA.",sauvage@gene.com,,,National Cancer Institute; National Center for Research Resources; National Institutes of Health,"The authors thank A.

Although nitric oxide ( NO) is known to be an important mediator of BDNF signalling in neurons(2), the mechanisms by which neurotrophins influence gene expression during development and plasticity remain largely unknown. Here we show that BDNF triggers NO synthesis and S- nitrosylation of histone deacetylase 2 ( HDAC2) in neurons, resulting in changes to histone modifications and gene activation. S- nitrosylation of HDAC2 occurs at Cys 262 and Cys 274 and does not affect deacetylase activity. In contrast, nitrosylation of HDAC2 induces its release from chromatin, which increases acetylation of histones surrounding neurotrophin- dependent gene promoters and promotes transcription. Notably, nitrosylation of HDAC2 in embryonic cortical neurons regulates dendritic growth and branching, possibly by the activation of CREB ( cyclic- AMP-responsive-element- binding protein)- dependent genes. Thus, by stimulating NO production and S- nitrosylation of HDAC2, neurotrophic factors promote chromatin remodelling and the activation of genes that are associated with neuronal development.","[Nott, Alexi; Watson, P.

In bacteria, the correct messenger RNA start site and the reading frame are selected when, with the help of initiation factors IF1, IF2 and IF3, the initiation codon is decoded in the peptidyl site of the 30S ribosomal subunit by the fMet-tRNA(fMet) anticodon. This yields a 30S initiation complex (30SIC) that is an intermediate in the formation of the 70S initiation complex (70SIC) that occurs on joining of the 50S ribosomal subunit to the 30SIC and release of the initiation factors(1-3). The localization of IF2 in the 30SIC has proved to be difficult so far using biochemical approaches, but could now be addressed using cryo- electron microscopy and advanced particle separation techniques on the basis of three- dimensional statistical analysis. Here we report the direct visualization of a 30SIC containing mRNA, fMet-tRNA(fMet) and initiation factors IF1 and GTP-bound IF2. We demonstrate that the fMet-tRNA(fMet) is held in a characteristic and precise position and conformation by two interactions that contribute to the formation of a stable complex: one involves the transfer RNA decoding stem which is buried in the 30S peptidyl site, and the other occurs between the carboxy- terminal domain of IF2 and the tRNA acceptor end. The structure provides insights into the mechanism of 70SIC assembly and rationalizes the rapid activation of GTP hydrolysis triggered on 30SIC-50S joining(2,3) by showing that the GTP- binding domain of IF2 would directly face the GTPase-activated centre of the 50S subunit.","[Simonetti, Angelita; Marzi, Stefano; Myasnikov, Alexander G.; Yusupov, Marat; Klaholz, Bruno P.] Inst Genet & Mol & Cellular Biol, Dept Struct Biol & Genom, F-67404 Illkirch Graffenstaden, France; [Simonetti, Angelita; Marzi, Stefano; Myasnikov, Alexander G.; Yusupov, Marat; Klaholz, Bruno P.] INSERM, U596, F-67404 Illkirch Graffenstaden, France; [Simonetti, Angelita; Marzi, Stefano; Myasnikov, Alexander G.; Yusupov, Marat; Klaholz, Bruno P.] CNRS, UMR7104, F-67404 Illkirch Graffenstaden, France; [Simonetti, Angelita; Marzi, Stefano; Myasnikov, Alexander G.; Yusupov, Marat; Klaholz, Bruno P.] Univ Strasbourg 1, F-67070 Strasbourg, France; [Marzi, Stefano] CNRS, Inst Biol Mol & Cellulaire, Architecture & React ARN, UPR 9002, F-67084 Strasbourg, France; [Fabbretti, Attilio; Gualerzi, Claudio O.] Univ Camerino, Dept Biol, Genet Lab, MCA, I-62032 Camerino, MC, Italy","Klaholz, BP (reprint author), Inst Genet & Mol & Cellular Biol, Dept Struct Biol & Genom, F-67404 Illkirch Graffenstaden, France.",klaholz@igbmc.u-strasbg.fr,"Yusupov, Marat/I-6126-2013; Fabbretti, Attilio/L-2524-2013; Marzi, Stefano/A-1810-2012","Yusupov, Marat/0000-0001-5544-0597; Fabbretti, Attilio/0000-0003-3928-2781; Marzi, Stefano/0000-0003-0399-4613","Centre National pour la Recherche Scientifique; Ministere de la Recherche et de la Technologie; European Molecular Biology Organization Young Investigator Programme; Institut du Developpement et des Ressources en Informatique Scientifique; European Commission [LSHG-CT-2006-031220]; SPINE2; Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale; Fondation de la Recherche Medicale; ULP,; CNRS; FRM; Alsace Regio; Association pour la Recherche sur le Cancer","We thank J.

Argonaute 2 ( Ago2) has a P-element- induced wimpy testis ( PIWI) domain, which folds like RNase H and is responsible for target RNA cleavage in RNA interference(1). Proteins such as Dicer, TRBP, MOV10, RHA, RCK/p54 and KIAA1093 associate with Ago proteins and participate in small RNA processing, RISC loading and localization of Ago proteins in the cytoplasmic messenger RNA processing bodies(1,2). However, mechanisms that regulate RNA interference remain obscure. Here we report physical interactions between Ago2 and the alpha-(P4H-alpha(I)) and beta-(P4H-beta) subunits of the type I collagen prolyl- 4- hydroxylase (C-P4H( I)). Mass spectrometric analysis identified hydroxylation of the endogenous Ago2 at proline 700. In vitro, both Ago2 and Ago4 seem to be more efficiently hydroxylated than Ago1 and Ago3 by recombinant human C-P4H( I). Importantly, human cells depleted of P4H-alpha(I) or P4H-beta by short hairpin RNA and P4H-alpha(I) null mouse embryonic fibroblast cells showed reduced stability of Ago2 and impaired short interfering RNA programmed RISC activity. Furthermore, mutation of proline 700 to alanine also resulted in destabilization of Ago2, thus linking Ago2 P700 and hydroxylation at this residue to its stability regulation. These findings identify hydroxylation as a post- translational modification important for Ago2 stability and effective RNA interference.","[Qi, Hank H.; Ongusaha, Pat P.; Shi, Yujiang; Lee, Sam W.; Shi, Yang] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Pathol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Ongusaha, Pat P.; Lee, Sam W.] Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Cutaneous Biol Res Ctr, Boston, MA 02129 USA; [Myllyharju, Johanna; Pakkanen, Outi] Univ Oulu, Oulu Ctr Cell Matrix Res, Bioctr Oulu, FIN-90014 Oulu, Finland; [Myllyharju, Johanna; Pakkanen, Outi] Univ Oulu, Dept Med Biochem & Mol Biol, FIN-90014 Oulu, Finland; [Cheng, Dongmei; Peng, Junmin] Emory Univ, Dept Human Genet, Ctr Neurodegenerat Dis, Sch Med, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA; [Shi, Yujiang] Brigham & Womens Hosp, Div Endocrinol Diabet & Hypertens, Dept Med, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Shi, Yujiang] Brigham & Womens Hosp, Div Endocrinol Diabet & Hypertens, BCMP, Boston, MA 02115 USA","Shi, Y (reprint author), Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Pathol, New Res Bldg 854,77 Ave Louis Pasteur, Boston, MA 02115 USA.",yang_shi@hms.harvard.edu,,,"Canadian Institute of Health Research; Health Science Council of the Academy of Finland [202469]; S.

Previous early optical observations of even the most exceptional GRBs ( 990123 and 030329) lacked both the temporal resolution to probe the optical flash in detail and the accuracy needed to trace the transition from the prompt emission within the outflow to external shocks caused by interaction with the progenitor environment. Here we report observations of the extraordinarily bright prompt optical and gamma-ray emission of GRB 080319B that provide diagnostics within seconds of its formation, followed by broadband observations of the afterglow decay that continued for weeks. We show that the prompt emission stems from a single physical region, implying an extremely relativistic outflow that propagates within the narrow inner core of a two- component jet.","[Racusin, J.

Strigolactones are compounds thought to be derived from carotenoids and are known to trigger the germination of parasitic plant seeds and stimulate symbiotic fungi. Here we present evidence that carotenoid cleavage dioxygenase 8 shoot branching mutants of pea are strigolactone deficient and that strigolactone application restores the wild- type branching phenotype to ccd8 mutants. Moreover, we show that other branching mutants previously characterized as lacking a response to the branching inhibition signal also lack strigolactone response, and are not deficient in strigolactones. These responses are conserved in Arabidopsis. In agreement with the expected properties of the hormonal signal, exogenous strigolactone can be transported in shoots and act at low concentrations. We suggest that endogenous strigolactones or related compounds inhibit shoot branching in plants. Furthermore, ccd8 mutants demonstrate the diverse effects of strigolactones in shoot branching, mycorrhizal symbiosis and parasitic weed interaction.","[Fermas, Soraya; Pillot, Jean-Paul; Rameau, Catherine] Inst JP Bourgin, Genet & Ameliorat Plantes Stn, INRA, UR254, F-78000 Versailles, France; [Gomez-Roldan, Victoria; Puech-Pages, Virginie; Danoun, Saida; Becard, Guillaume; Rochange, Soizic F.] Univ Toulouse 1, F-31326 Castanet Tolosan, France; [Gomez-Roldan, Victoria; Puech-Pages, Virginie; Danoun, Saida; Becard, Guillaume; Rochange, Soizic F.] UPS, F-31326 Castanet Tolosan, France; [Gomez-Roldan, Victoria; Puech-Pages, Virginie; Danoun, Saida; Becard, Guillaume; Rochange, Soizic F.] CNRS, F-31326 Castanet Tolosan, France; [Brewer, Philip B.; Dun, Elizabeth A.; Beveridge, Christine A.] Univ Queensland, ARC Ctr Excellence Integrat Legume Res, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia; [Letisse, Fabien; Portais, Jean-Charles] INSA Toulouse, CNRS, UMR5504, UMR792,INRA, F-31400 Toulouse, France; [Matusova, Radoslava; Bouwmeester, Harro] Plant Res Int, NL-6700 AA Wageningen, Netherlands; [Bouwmeester, Harro] Univ Wageningen & Res Ctr, Lab Plant Physiol, NL-6703 BD Wageningen, Netherlands; [Beveridge, Christine A.] Univ Queensland, Sch Integrat Biol, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia","Rameau, C (reprint author), Inst JP Bourgin, Genet & Ameliorat Plantes Stn, INRA, UR254, F-78000 Versailles, France.",becard@scsv.ups-tlse.fr; rameau@versailles.inra.fr,"Brewer, Philip/C-6562-2008; Beveridge, Christine/B-3514-2009; Matusova, Radoslava/A-1886-2017; Dun, Elizabeth/A-1283-2010","Brewer, Philip/0000-0003-4871-9260; Beveridge, Christine/0000-0003-0878-3110; Matusova, Radoslava/0000-0001-9181-295X; Dun, Elizabeth/0000-0003-4068-0349; Bouwmeester, Harro/0000-0003-0907-2732",French Ministry of Research and Higher Education; ANR; The Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research (NWO; VICI-grant),"V.G.-R. was supported by the French Ministry of Research and Higher Education.

Two classes of hormones, auxin and cytokinin, have long been known to have an important involvement in controlling shoot branching. Previous studies using a series of mutants with enhanced shoot branching suggested the existence of a third class of hormone( s) that is derived from carotenoids, but its chemical identity has been unknown. Here we show that levels of strigolactones, a group of terpenoid lactones, are significantly reduced in some of the branching mutants. Furthermore, application of strigolactones inhibits shoot branching in these mutants. Strigolactones were previously found in root exudates acting as communication chemicals with parasitic weeds and symbiotic arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi. Thus, we propose that strigolactones act as a new hormone class - or their biosynthetic precursors - in regulating above- ground plant architecture, and also have a function in underground communication with other neighbouring organisms.","[Umehara, Mikihisa; Hanada, Atsushi; Yoshida, Satoko; Takeda-Kamiya, Noriko; Magome, Hiroshi; Kamiya, Yuji; Shirasu, Ken; Yamaguchi, Shinjiro] RIKEN, Plant Sci Ctr, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2300045, Japan; [Akiyama, Kohki] Osaka Prefecture Univ, Grad Sch Life & Environm Sci, Naka Ku, Osaka 5998531, Japan; [Arite, Tomotsugu; Kyozuka, Junko] Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Agr & Life Sci, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo 1138652, Japan; [Yoneyama, Koichi] Utsunomiya Univ, Weed Sci Ctr, Utsunomiya, Tochigi 3218505, Japan","Yamaguchi, S (reprint author), RIKEN, Plant Sci Ctr, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2300045, Japan.",shinjiro@postman.riken.jp,"Shirasu, Ken/A-4455-2010; Kamiya, Yuji/F-9420-2010; Yoshida, Satoko/G-5003-2010; Umehara, Mikihisa/D-2416-2011; Akiyama, Kohki /B-4668-2012; Kyozuka, Junko/E-7844-2012; Yamaguchi, Shinjiro/F-9684-2010","Shirasu, Ken/0000-0002-0349-3870; Kamiya, Yuji/0000-0003-4415-520X; Yoshida, Satoko/0000-0002-9999-7861; YONEYAMA, KOICHI/0000-0002-4930-035X","MEXT of Japan [1820810, 19678001, 19780040]; MAFF of Japan (Genomics for Agricultural Innovation) [IPG0001]; RIKEN Special Postdoctoral Researchers Program","We are grateful to S.

The nineteenth- century eruption of eta Carinae, the prototype of these events(3), ejected about 12 solar masses at speeds of 650 km s(-1), with a kinetic energy of almost 10(50) erg ( ref. 4). Some faster material with speeds up to 1,000 2,000 km s(-1) had previously been reported(5-8) but its full distribution was unknown. Here I report observations of much faster material with speeds up to 3,500-6,000 km s(-1), reaching farther from the star than the fastest material in previous reports(5). This fast material roughly doubles the kinetic energy of the nineteenth-century event and suggests that it released a blast wave now propagating ahead of the massive ejecta. As a result, eta Carinae's outer shell now mimics a low- energy supernova remnant. The eruption has usually been discussed in terms of an extreme wind driven by the star's luminosity(2,3,9,10), but the fast material reported here indicates that it may have been powered by a deep- seated explosion rivalling a supernova, perhaps triggered by the pulsational pair instability(11). This may alter interpretations of similar events seen in other galaxies.","[Smith, Nathan] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Astron, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA","Smith, N (reprint author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Astron, 601 Campbell Hall, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",nathans@astro.berkeley.edu,,,,,,29,51,51,0,2,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,11-Sep,2008,455,7210,,,,,201,203,,10.1038/nature07269,,3,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,346SZ,WOS:000259090800041,18784719,No,,,11/20/17

A prime example is the Mott insulator, in which suppression of conductivity occurs as a result of interactions rather than a filled Bloch band(1). Proximity to the Mott insulating phase in fermionic systems is the origin of many intriguing phenomena in condensed matter physics(2), most notably high- temperature superconductivity(3). The Hubbard model(4), which encompasses the essential physics of the Mott insulator, also applies to quantum gases trapped in an optical lattice(5,6). It is therefore now possible to access this regime with tools developed in atomic physics. However, an atomic Mott insulator has so far been realized only with a gas of bosons(7), which lack the rich and peculiar nature of fermions. Here we report the formation of a Mott insulator of a repulsively interacting two- component Fermi gas in an optical lattice. It is identified by three features: a drastic suppression of doubly occupied lattice sites, a strong reduction of the compressibility inferred from the response of double occupancy to an increase in atom number, and the appearance of a gapped mode in the excitation spectrum. Direct control of the interaction strength allows us to compare the Mott insulating regime and the non- interacting regime without changing tunnel- coupling or confinement. Our results pave the way for further studies of the Mott insulator, including spin- ordering and ultimately the question of d- wave superfluidity(6,8).","[Joerdens, Robert; Strohmaier, Niels; Guenther, Kenneth; Moritz, Henning; Esslinger, Tilman] ETH, Inst Quantum Elect, CH-8093 Zurich, Switzerland; [Guenther, Kenneth] Ecole Normale Super, Lab Kastler Brossel, F-75005 Paris, France","Moritz, H (reprint author), ETH, Inst Quantum Elect, CH-8093 Zurich, Switzerland.",moritz@phys.ethz.ch,"Esslinger, Tilman/M-9022-2016; Jordens, Robert/F-1066-2010; Gunter, Kenneth/A-9016-2010; Moritz, Henning/E-7919-2010","Esslinger, Tilman/0000-0002-8333-107X; Jordens, Robert/0000-0001-5333-0562; Gunter, Kenneth/0000-0002-6332-8340; Moritz, Henning/0000-0002-4854-5806",Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF); EU projects Optical Lattices and Quantum Information (OLAQUI); Scalable Quantum Computing with Light and Atoms ( SCALA); Quantum Science and Technology (QSIT) project of ETH Zurich,"We thank J.

J,"Wheeler, TD; Stroock, AD",,,,"Wheeler, Tobias D.; Stroock, Abraham D.",,,The transpiration of water at negative pressures in a synthetic tree,NATURE,,,English,Article,,,,,,,SYSTEM; CAVITATION; RESISTANCE; CAPILLARY; TRANSPORT; SUCTION; PLANTS,"Plant scientists believe that transpiration - the motion of water from the soil, through a vascular plant, and into the air - occurs by a passive, wicking mechanism. This mechanism is described by the cohesion- tension theory: loss of water by evaporation reduces the pressure of the liquid water within the leaf relative to atmospheric pressure; this reduced pressure pulls liquid water out of the soil and up the xylem to maintain hydration(1-3). Strikingly, the absolute pressure of the water within the xylem is often negative, such that the liquid is under tension and is thermodynamically metastable with respect to the vapour phase(1,4). Qualitatively, this mechanism is the same as that which drives fluid through the synthetic wicks that are key elements in technologies for heat transfer(5), fuel cells(6,7) and portable chemical systems(8-10). Quantitatively, the differences in pressure generated in plants to drive flow can be more than a hundredfold larger than those generated in synthetic wicks. Here we present the design and operation of a microfluidic system formed in a synthetic hydrogel. This synthetic 'tree' captures the main attributes of transpiration in plants: transduction of subsaturation in the vapour phase of water into negative pressures in the liquid phase, stabilization and flow of liquid water at large negative pressures (-1.0 MPa or lower), continuous heat transfer with the evaporation of liquid water at negative pressure, and continuous extraction of liquid water from subsaturated sources. This development opens the opportunity for technological uses of water under tension and for new experimental studies of the liquid state of water.","[Wheeler, Tobias D.; Stroock, Abraham D.] Cornell Univ, Sch Chem & Biomol Engn, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA","Stroock, AD (reprint author), Cornell Univ, Sch Chem & Biomol Engn, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",ads10@cornell.edu,,,Office of Naval Research Young Investigator Program; Camille and Henry Dreyfus Foundation; Corning Foundation; National Science Foundation (NSF); Nanobiotechnology Center; STC Program of the NSF [ECS-98767710]; Cornell Center for Materials Research; NSF [DMR- 0520404],"We thank M.

The sequestered carbon dioxide is stored in live woody tissues and slowly decomposing organic matter in litter and soil(4). Old- growth forests therefore serve as a global carbon dioxide sink, but they are not protected by international treaties, because it is generally thought that ageing forests cease to accumulate carbon(5,6). Here we report a search of literature and databases for forest carbon- flux estimates. We find that in forests between 15 and 800 years of age, net ecosystem productivity ( the net carbon balance of the forest including soils) is usually positive. Our results demonstrate that old- growth forests can continue to accumulate carbon, contrary to the long-standing view that they are carbon neutral. Over 30 per cent of the global forest area is unmanaged primary forest, and this area contains the remaining old- growth forests(7). Half of the primary forests (6 x 10(8) hectares) are located in the boreal and temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. On the basis of our analysis, these forests alone sequester about 1.3 +/- 0.5 gigatonnes of carbon per year. Thus, our findings suggest that 15 per cent of the global forest area, which is currently not considered when offsetting increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations, provides at least 10 per cent of the global net ecosystem productivity(8). Old- growth forests accumulate carbon for centuries and contain large quantities of it. We expect, however, that much of this carbon, even soil carbon(9), will move back to the atmosphere if these forests are disturbed.","[Luyssaert, Sebastiaan] Univ Antwerp, Dept Biol, B-2610 Antwerp, Belgium; [Luyssaert, Sebastiaan; Law, Beverly E.] Oregon State Univ, Coll Forestry, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA; [Schulze, E. -Detlef; Boerner, Annett; Hessenmoeller, Dominik] Max Planck Inst Biogeochem, D-07701 Jena, Germany; [Knohl, Alexander] ETH, Inst Plant Sci, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland; [Ciais, Philippe] CEA CNRS UVSQ, IPSL LSCE, Lab Sci Climat & Environm, F-91191 Gif Sur Yvette, France; [Grace, John] Univ Edinburgh, Sch Geosci, Edinburgh EH9 3JN, Midlothian, Scotland","Luyssaert, S (reprint author), Univ Antwerp, Dept Biol, B-2610 Antwerp, Belgium.",sebastiaan.luyssaert@ua.ac.be,"; Luyssaert, Sebastiaan/F-6684-2011; Grace, John/N-9280-2013; Knohl, Alexander/F-9453-2014; Schulze, Ernst-Detlef/K-9627-2014; Law, Beverly/G-3882-2010","Luyssaert, Sebastiaan/0000-0003-1121-1869; Knohl, Alexander/0000-0002-7615-8870; Law, Beverly/0000-0002-1605-1203","CoE ECO UA-Methusalem and the Research Foundation - Flanders (FWO-Vlaanderen); European Union with a Marie Curie fellowship; North American Carbon Program project ORCA; US Department of Energy, Terrestrial Carbon Program [DE-FG02-04ER63917]; DFG-Exploratories.; CarboEuropeIP [GOCE-CT-2003-505572]; Ameriflux","We thank all site investigators, their funding agencies and the various regional flux networks (Afriflux, AmeriFlux, AsiaFlux, CarboAfrica, CarboEuropeIP, ChinaFlux, Fluxnet-Canada, KoFlux, LBA, NECC, OzFlux, TCOS-Siberia and USCCC), and the Fluxnet project, whose support was essential for obtaining our measurements.

Critical to the evaluation of hazards associated with the next eruption is the estimation of the depth of the magma reservoir, one of the main parameters controlling magma properties and eruptive style. Petrological studies have indicated that during past activity, magma chambers were at depths between 3 and 16 km ( refs 3-7). Geophysical surveys have imaged some levels of seismic attenuation, the shallowest of which lies at 8-9 km depth(8), and these have been tentatively interpreted as levels of preferential magma accumulation. By using experimental phase equilibria, carried out on material from four main explosive events at Vesuvius, we show here that the reservoirs that fed the eruptive activity migrated from 7-8 km to 3-4 km depth between the AD 79 ( Pompeii) and AD 472 ( Pollena) events. If data from the Pomici di Base event 18.5 kyr ago(9) and the 1944 Vesuvius eruption(7) are included, the total upward migration of the reservoir amounts to 9-11 km. The change of preferential magma ponding levels in the upper crust can be attributed to differences in the volatile content and buoyancy of ascending magmas, as well as to changes in local stress field following either caldera formation(10) or volcano spreading(11). Reservoir migration, and the possible influence on feeding rates(12), should be integrated into the parameters used for defining expected eruptive scenarios at Vesuvius.","[Scaillet, B.; Pichavant, M.] CNRS, INSU, Inst Sci Terre Orleans, F-45071 Orleans 2, France; [Scaillet, B.; Pichavant, M.] Univ Orleans, Inst Sci Terre Orleans, F-45071 Orleans, France; [Cioni, R.] Dipartimento Sci Terra, I-09127 Cagliari, Italy; [Cioni, R.] INGV, Sez Pisa, I-56100 Pisa, Italy","Scaillet, B (reprint author), CNRS, INSU, Inst Sci Terre Orleans, 1A Rue Ferollerie, F-45071 Orleans 2, France.",bscaille@cnrs-orleans.fr,"Scaillet, Bruno/A-5846-2012; Cioni, Raffaello/A-6357-2012; Pichavant, Michel/C-1371-2012","Pichavant, Michel/0000-0001-8346-5302; Cioni, Raffaello/0000-0002-2526-9095",GNV; INGV; department of the Italian Civil Defense,"We thank R.

Here we examine these issues using the relationship between phenotypic diversity and resource input in the T7 - Escherichia coli co- evolving system as a case history. We establish a mathematical model of this interaction, framed as one instance of a super- class of host - parasite co- evolutionary models, and show that it captures experimental results. By tuning this model, we then ask how diversity as a function of resource input could behave for alternative co- evolving partners ( for example, E. coli with lambda bacteriophages). In contrast to populations lacking bacteriophages, variation in diversity with differences in resources is always found for co- evolving populations, supporting the geographic mosaic theory of co- evolution(2). The form of this variation is not, however, universal. Details of infectivity are pivotal: in T7 - E. coli with a modified gene- for- gene interaction, diversity is low at high resource input, whereas, for matching- allele interactions, maximal diversity is found at high resource input. A combination of in vitro systems and appropriately configured mathematical models is an effective means to isolate results particular to the in vitro system, to characterize systems likely to behave differently and to understand the biology underpinning those alternatives.","[Hurst, Laurence D.] Univ Bath, Dept Biol & Biochem, Bath BA2 7AY, Avon, England; [Forde, Samantha E.; Thompson, John N.] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA; [Beardmore, Robert E.; Gudelj, Ivana; Arkin, Sinan S.] Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Dept Math, London SW7 2AZ, England; [Gudelj, Ivana] Univ Bath, Dept Math Sci, Bath BA2 7AY, Avon, England","Hurst, LD (reprint author), Univ Bath, Dept Biol & Biochem, Bath BA2 7AY, Avon, England.",l.d.hurst@bath.ac.uk,"Hurst, Laurence/F-9215-2010","Hurst, Laurence/0000-0002-1002-1054",NERC Advanced Fellowship; ORS award; Department of Mathematics at Imperial College London; National Science Foundation [DEB 0515598],"We thank A.

They dominate phytoplankton biomass in post-bloom, stratified oceanic temperate waters(2). Traditionally, large and small algae are viewed as having a critical growth dependence on inorganic nutrients, which the latter can better acquire at lower ambient concentrations owing to their higher surface area to volume ratios(3,4). Nonetheless, recent phosphate tracer experiments in the oligotrophic ocean(5) have suggested that small algae obtain inorganic phosphate indirectly, possibly through feeding on bacterioplankton. There have been numerous microscopy- based studies of algae feeding mixotrophically(6,7) in the laboratory(8-10) and field(11-14), as well as mathematical modelling of the ecological importance of mixotrophy(15). However, because of methodological limitations(16) there has not been a direct comparison of obligate heterotrophic and mixotrophic bacterivory. Here we present direct evidence that small algae carry out 40 - 95% of the bacterivory in the euphotic layer of the temperate North Atlantic Ocean in summer. A similar range of 37 - 70% was determined in the surface waters of the tropical North- East Atlantic Ocean, suggesting the global significance of mixotrophy. This finding reveals that even the smallest algae have less dependence on dissolved inorganic nutrients than previously thought, obtaining a quarter of their biomass from bacterivory. This has important implications for how we perceive nutrient acquisition and limitation of carbon- fixing protists as well as control of bacterioplankton in the ocean.","[Zubkov, Mikhail V.] Natl Ocean Ctr, Southampton SO14 3ZH, Hants, England; [Tarran, Glen A.] Plymouth Marine Lab, Plymouth PL1 3DH, Devon, England","Zubkov, MV (reprint author), Natl Ocean Ctr, Southampton SO14 3ZH, Hants, England.",mvz@noc.soton.ac.uk,,,UK Natural Environment Research Council (NERC); Oceans 2025 core programmes of the National Oceanography Centre; Southampton and Plymouth Marine Laboratory; NERC thematic programme Surface Ocean Low Atmosphere Study (SOLAS),"We gratefully acknowledge the captain, officers and crew aboard the RRS Discovery for their help during the cruises, M.

Statisticians use measures such as P values to assign degrees of confidence to propositions, but little is known about how the brain computes confidence estimates about decisions. We explored this issue using behavioural analysis and neural recordings in rats in combination with computational modelling. Subjects were trained to perform an odour categorization task that allowed decision confidence to be manipulated by varying the distance of the test stimulus to the category boundary. To understand how confidence could be computed along with the choice itself, using standard models of decision-making(3-6), we defined a simple measure that quantified the quality of the evidence contributing to a particular decision. Here we show that the firing rates of many single neurons in the orbitofrontal cortex match closely to the predictions of confidence models and cannot be readily explained by alternative mechanisms, such as learning stimulus - outcome associations(7-10). Moreover, when tested using a delayed reward version of the task, we found that rats' willingness to wait for rewards increased with confidence, as predicted by the theoretical model. These results indicate that confidence estimates, previously suggested to require 'metacognition'(11,12) and conscious awareness(13,14), are available even in the rodent brain, can be computed with relatively simple operations, and can drive adaptive behaviour. We suggest that confidence estimation may be a fundamental and ubiquitous component of decision- making.","[Kepecs, Adam; Uchida, Naoshige; Zariwala, Hatim A.; Mainen, Zachary F.] Cold Spring Harbor Lab, Cold Spring Harbor, NY 11724 USA; [Uchida, Naoshige] Harvard Univ, Dept Mol & Cellular Biol, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Uchida, Naoshige] Harvard Univ, Ctr Brain Sci, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Zariwala, Hatim A.] Allen Inst Brain Sci, Seattle, WA 98103 USA; [Mainen, Zachary F.] Gulbenkian Inst Sci, Champalimaud Neurosci Programme, P-2780901 Oeiras, Portugal","Kepecs, A (reprint author), Cold Spring Harbor Lab, 1 Bungtown Rd, Cold Spring Harbor, NY 11724 USA.",kepecs@cshl.edu; zmainen@igc.gulbenkian.pt,,"Uchida, Naoshige/0000-0002-5755-9409; Mainen, Zachary/0000-0001-7913-9109",National Institutes of Health (NIDCD); Center for the Neural Mechanisms of Cognition at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory; Swartz Foundation,"We thank J.

Thus, rare variants may account for a larger fraction of the overall genetic risk than previously assumed. In contrast to rare single nucleotide mutations, rare copy number variations ( CNVs) can be detected using genome- wide single nucleotide polymorphism arrays. This has led to the identification of CNVs associated with mental retardation(4,5) and autism(2). In a genome- wide search for CNVs associating with schizophrenia, we used a population-based sample to identify de novo CNVs by analysing 9,878 transmissions from parents to offspring. The 66 de novo CNVs identified were tested for association in a sample of 1,433 schizophrenia cases and 33,250 controls. Three deletions at 1q21.1, 15q11.2 and 15q13.3 showing nominal association with schizophrenia in the first sample ( phase I) were followed up in a second sample of 3,285 cases and 7,951 controls ( phase II). All three deletions significantly associate with schizophrenia and related psychoses in the combined sample. The identification of these rare, recurrent risk variants, having occurred independently in multiple founders and being subject to negative selection, is important in itself. CNV analysis may also point the way to the identification of additional and more prevalent risk variants in genes and pathways involved in schizophrenia.","[Crombie, Caroline; Fraser, Gillian; St Clair, David] Univ Aberdeen, Royal Cornhill Hosp, Dept Mental Hlth, Aberdeen AB25 2ZD, Scotland; [Stefansson, Hreinn; Ingason, Andres; Steinberg, Stacy; Fossdal, Ragnheidur; Gylfason, Arnaldur; Halldorsson, Bjarni V.; Gudbjartsson, Daniel; Thorgeirsson, Thorgeir E.; Sigurdsson, Asgeir; Jonasdottir, Adalbjorg; Jonasdottir, Aslaug; Bjornsson, Asgeir; Mattiasdottir, Sigurborg; Blondal, Thorarinn; Gulcher, Jeffrey R.; Thorsteinsdottir, Unnur; Kong, Augustine; Stefansson, Kari] deCODE Genet, CNS Div, IS-101 Reykjavik, Iceland; [Rujescu, Dan; Giegling, Ina; Moeller, Hans-Juergen; Hartmann, Annette] Univ Munich, Div Mol & Clin Neurobiol, Dept Psychiat, Genet Res Ctr, D-80336 Munich, Germany; [Cichon, Sven; Vasilescu, Catalina; Muehleisen, Thomas W.; Noethen, Markus M.] Univ Bonn, Dept Genom, Life & Brain Ctr, D-53127 Bonn, Germany; [Cichon, Sven; Noethen, Markus M.] Univ Bonn, Inst Human Genet, D-53111 Bonn, Germany; [Pietilainen, Olli P.

Inheritance patterns are complex, and the number and type of genetic variants involved are not understood. Copy number variants ( CNVs) have been identified in individual patients with schizophrenia(2-7) and also in neurodevelopmental disorders(8-11), but large- scale genome- wide surveys have not been performed. Here we report a genome- wide survey of rare CNVs in 3,391 patients with schizophrenia and 3,181 ancestrally matched controls, using high- density microarrays. For CNVs that were observed in less than 1% of the sample and were more than 100 kilobases in length, the total burden is increased 1.15- fold in patients with schizophrenia in comparison with controls. This effect was more pronounced for rarer, single- occurrence CNVs and for those that involved genes as opposed to those that did not. As expected, deletions were found within the region critical for velo- cardio- facial syndrome, which includes psychotic symptoms in 30% of patients(12). Associations with schizophrenia were also found for large deletions on chromosome 15q13.3 and 1q21.1. These associations have not previously been reported, and they remained significant after genome- wide correction. Our results provide strong support for a model of schizophrenia pathogenesis that includes the effects of multiple rare structural variants, both genome- wide and at specific loci.","[Stone, Jennifer L.; Ruderfer, Douglas M.; Sklar, Pamela; Purcell, Shaun M.] Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Dept Psychiat, Boston, MA 02114 USA; [Stone, Jennifer L.; Ruderfer, Douglas M.; Sklar, Pamela; Purcell, Shaun M.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Boston, MA 02114 USA; [Stone, Jennifer L.; Ruderfer, Douglas M.; Sklar, Pamela; Purcell, Shaun M.; Scolnick, E.

However, our understanding of the molecular interaction of such flaviviruses with mammalian host cells is limited(1). WNV encodes only 10 proteins, implying that it may use many cellular proteins for infection(1). WNV enters the cytoplasm through pH- dependent endocytosis, undergoes cycles of translation and replication, assembles progeny virions in association with endoplasmic reticulum, and exits along the secretory pathway(1-3). RNA interference ( RNAi) presents a powerful forward genetics approach to dissect virus - host cell interactions(4-6). Here we report the identification of 305 host proteins that affect WNV infection, using a human- genome-wide RNAi screen. Functional clustering of the genes revealed a complex dependence of this virus on host cell physiology, requiring a wide variety of molecules and cellular pathways for successful infection. We further demonstrate a requirement for the ubiquitin ligase CBLL1 in WNV internalization, a post- entry role for the endoplasmic- reticulum- associated degradation pathway in viral infection, and the monocarboxylic acid transporter MCT4 as a viral replication resistance factor. By extending this study to dengue virus, we show that flaviviruses have both overlapping and unique interaction strategies with host cells. This study provides a comprehensive molecular portrait of WNV - human cell interactions that forms a model for understanding single plus- stranded RNA virus infection, and reveals potential antiviral targets.","[Krishnan, Manoj N.; Sukumaran, Bindu; Sultana, Hameeda; Fikrig, Erol] Yale Univ, Sch Med, Infect Dis Sect, Dept Internal Med, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Qian, Feng; Montgomery, Ruth R.] Yale Univ, Sch Med, Rheumatol Sect, Dept Internal Med, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Uchil, Pradeep D.; Adametz, Rachel; Agaisse, Herve] Yale Univ, Sch Med, Sect Microbial Pathogenesis, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Ng, Aylwin; Xavier, Ramnik J.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Ctr Computat & Integrat Biol, Boston, MA 02114 USA; [Ng, Aylwin; Xavier, Ramnik J.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Gastrointestinal Unit, Boston, MA 02114 USA; [Gilfoy, Felicia D.; Mason, Peter W.] Univ Texas Galveston, Med Branch, Dept Pathol, Galveston, TX 77555 USA; [Tsui, Melody] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Brigham & Womens Hosp, Dept Syst Biol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Brass, Abraham L.; Elledge, Stephen J.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Brigham & Womens Hosp, Dept Genet,Ctr Genet & Genom, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Lev, Sima] Weizmann Inst Sci, Dept Neurobiol, IL-76100 Rehovot, Israel; [Koski, Raymond A.] L2 Diagnost, New Haven, CT 06511 USA; [Elledge, Stephen J.; Fikrig, Erol] Howard Hughes Med Inst, Chevy Chase, MD 20815 USA","Fikrig, E (reprint author), Yale Univ, Sch Med, Infect Dis Sect, Dept Internal Med, 333 Cedar St, New Haven, CT 06520 USA.",erol.fikrig@yale.edu,"Qian, Feng/F-8186-2010","Montgomery, Ruth/0000-0002-8661-4454","New England Regional Center of Excellence in Biodefense and Emerging Infectious Disease [U54AI057159]; NIH [AI062773, U54 AI057156]; Crohn's and Colitis Foundation of America; CCIB development funds; Emerging and Tropical Infectious Diseases [AI07526]; NIAID",The human genome RNAi library wasmade available through the support of the New England Regional Center of Excellence in Biodefense and Emerging Infectious Disease (U54AI057159).

It is induced in activated T cells and is reported to process a variety of substrates including the anti- inflammatory cytokine transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta 1 ( refs 2 - 4), but the non- redundant functions of furin versus other proprotein convertases in T cells are unclear. Here we show that conditional deletion of furin in T cells allowed for normal T- cell development but impaired the function of regulatory and effector T cells, which produced less TGF-beta 1. Furin-deficient T regulatory (T-reg) cells were less protective in a T- cell transfer colitis model and failed to induce Foxp3 in normal T cells. Additionally, furin- deficient effector cells were inherently over-active and were resistant to suppressive activity of wild- type T-reg cells. Thus, our results indicate that furin is indispensable in maintaining peripheral tolerance, which is due, at least in part, to its non- redundant, essential function in regulating TGF-beta 1 production. Targeting furin has emerged as a strategy in malignant and infectious disease(5,6). Our results suggest that inhibiting furin might activate immune responses, but may result in a breakdown in peripheral tolerance.","[Pesu, Marko; Watford, Wendy T.; Wei, Lai; O'Shea, John J.] NIAMSD, Mol Immunol & Inflammat Branch, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Xu, Lili; Fuss, Ivan; Strober, Warren] NIAID, Mucosal Immun Sect, Host Def Lab, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Andersson, John; Shevach, Ethan M.] NIAID, Cellular Immunol Sect, Immunol Lab, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Bouladoux, Nicolas; Belkaid, Yasmine] NIAID, Mucosal Immunol Unit, Parasit Dis Lab, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Quezado, Martha] NCI, Pathol Lab, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Roebroek, Anton; Creemers, John] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Biochem Neuroendocrinol Lab, B-3000 Louvain, Belgium; [Roebroek, Anton; Creemers, John] VIB, B-3000 Louvain, Belgium","Pesu, M (reprint author), NIAMSD, Mol Immunol & Inflammat Branch, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA.",pesum@mail.nih.gov,"Andersson, John/A-4436-2009; Pesu, marko/L-6344-2013; Wei, Lai/D-1088-2014","Andersson, John/0000-0003-2799-6349; Bouladoux, Nicolas/0000-0003-1593-671X",Intramural Research Program of NIAMS; Academy of Finland; Finnish Medical Foundation; Maud Kuistila Memorial Foundation; Fonds voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek Vlaanderen; Geconcerteerde Onderzoeksactie van de Vlaamse Gemeenschap,"We thank J.

The crucial role of centromeric heterochromatin is still unknown, because even in simpler unicellular organisms such as the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, the heterochromatin protein Swi6 ( HP1 homologue) has several functions at centromeres, including silencing gene expression and recombination, enriching cohesin, promoting kinetochore assembly, and, ultimately, preventing erroneous microtubule attachment to the kinetochores(1,3-6). Here we show that the requirement of heterochromatin for mitotic chromosome segregation is largely replaced by forcibly enriching cohesin at centromeres in fission yeast. However, this enrichment of cohesin is not sufficient to replace the meiotic requirement for heterochromatin. We find that the heterochromatin protein Swi6 associates directly with meiosis- specific shugoshin Sgo1, a protector of cohesin at centromeres. A point mutation of Sgo1 (V242E), which abolishes the interaction with Swi6, impairs the centromeric localization and function of Sgo1. The forced centromeric localization of Sgo1 restores proper meiotic chromosome segregation in swi6 Delta cells. We also show that the direct link between HP1 and shugoshin is conserved in human cells. Taken together, our findings suggest that the recruitment of shugoshin is the important primary role for centromeric heterochromatin in ensuring eukaryotic chromosome segregation.","[Yamagishi, Yuya; Sakuno, Takeshi; Watanabe, Yoshinori] Univ Tokyo, Lab Chromosome Dynam, Inst Mol & Cellular Biosci, Tokyo 1130032, Japan; [Yamagishi, Yuya; Sakuno, Takeshi; Watanabe, Yoshinori] Univ Tokyo, Grad Program Biophys & Biochem, Grad Sch Sci, Tokyo 1130032, Japan; [Shimura, Mari] Int Med Ctr Japan, Dept Intractable Dis, Tokyo 1628655, Japan","Watanabe, Y (reprint author), Univ Tokyo, Lab Chromosome Dynam, Inst Mol & Cellular Biosci, Tokyo 1130032, Japan.",ywatanab@iam.u-tokyo.ac.jp,,,"Global COE programme (Integrative life Science Based on the Study of Biosignaling Mechanisms); MEXT, Japan; Toray Science Foundation; Grants-in-Aid for Research on Advanced Medical Technology; Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare","We thank S.

Conventionally, spectra are measured using frequency spectroscopy, whereby the frequency of a harmonic electromagnetic driving field is tuned into resonance with a particular separation between energy levels. Although this technique has been successfully employed in a variety of physical systems, including natural and artificial atoms and molecules, its application is not universally straightforward and becomes extremely challenging for frequencies in the range of tens to hundreds of gigahertz. Here we introduce a complementary approach, amplitude spectroscopy, whereby a harmonic driving field sweeps an artificial atom through the avoided crossings between energy levels at a fixed frequency. Spectroscopic information is obtained from the amplitude dependence of the system's response, thereby overcoming many of the limitations of a broadband- frequency- based approach. The resulting 'spectroscopy diamonds', the regions in parameter space where transitions between specific pairs of levels can occur, exhibit interference patterns and population inversion that serve to distinguish the atom's spectrum. Amplitude spectroscopy provides a means of manipulating and characterizing systems over an extremely broad bandwidth, using only a single driving frequency that may be orders of magnitude smaller than the energy scales being probed.","[Berns, David M.; Oliver, William D.; Orlando, Terry P.] MIT, Elect Res Lab, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Berns, David M.; Rudner, Mark S.; Levitov, Leonid S.] MIT, Dept Phys, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Valenzuela, Sergio O.] MIT, Francis Bitter Natl Magnet Lab, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Berggren, Karl K.; Oliver, William D.] MIT, Lincoln Lab, Lexington, MA 02420 USA; [Orlando, Terry P.] MIT, Dept Elect Engn & Comp Sci, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA","Oliver, WD (reprint author), MIT, Elect Res Lab, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",oliver@ll.mit.edu,"Rudner, Mark/C-9325-2015","Rudner, Mark/0000-0002-5150-6234",Air Force Office of Scientific Research and the Laboratory for Physical Sciences [F49620-01-1-0457]; Defense University Research Initiative in Nanotechnology; US government; US Department of Defence under Air Force Contract [FA8721-05-C-0002],"We thank A.

In parallel, we quantified mRNA levels using microarrays. Here we show that a single miRNA can repress the production of hundreds of proteins, but that this repression is typically relatively mild. A number of known features of the miRNA- binding site such as the seed sequence also govern repression of human protein synthesis, and we report additional target sequence characteristics.

Here we use quantitative mass spectrometry to measure the response of thousands of proteins after introducing microRNAs into cultured cells and after deleting mir- 223 in mouse neutrophils. The identities of the responsive proteins indicate that targeting is primarily through seed- matched sites located within favourable predicted contexts in 39 untranslated regions. Hundreds of genes were directly repressed, albeit each to a modest degree, by individual microRNAs. Although some targets were repressed without detectable changes in mRNA levels, those translationally repressed by more than a third also displayed detectable mRNA destabilization, and, for the more highly repressed targets, mRNA destabilization usually comprised the major component of repression. The impact of microRNAs on the proteome indicated that for most interactions microRNAs act as rheostats to make fine- scale adjustments to protein output.","[Villen, Judit; Gygi, Steven P.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Cell Biol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Baek, Daehyun; Shin, Chanseok; Camargo, Fernando D.; Bartel, David P.] Whitehead Inst Biomed Res, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; [Baek, Daehyun; Shin, Chanseok; Bartel, David P.] MIT, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Baek, Daehyun; Shin, Chanseok; Bartel, David P.] MIT, Dept Biol, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA","Gygi, SP (reprint author), Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Cell Biol, 240 Longwood Ave, Boston, MA 02115 USA.",steven_gygi@hms.harvard.edu; dbartel@wi.mit.edu,,"Villen, Judit/0000-0002-1005-1739",Damon Runyon postdoctoral fellowship; NIH,"We thank S.-J.

Although the Drosophila embryonic Decapentaplegic ( Dpp) gradient has served as a model to understand how morphogen gradients are established, no role for the extracellular matrix has been previously described. Here we show that type IV collagen extracellular matrix proteins bind Dpp and regulate its signalling in both the Drosophila embryo and ovary. We provide evidence that the interaction between Dpp and type IV collagen augments Dpp signalling in the embryo by promoting gradient formation, yet it restricts the signalling range in the ovary through sequestration of the Dpp ligand. Together, these results identify a critical function of type IV collagens in modulating Dpp in the extracellular space during Drosophila development. On the basis of our findings that human type IV collagen binds BMP4, we predict that this role of type IV collagens will be conserved.","[Wang, Xiaomeng; Harris, Robin E.; Bayston, Laura J.; Ashe, Hilary L.] Univ Manchester, Fac Life Sci, Manchester M13 9PT, Lancs, England","Ashe, HL (reprint author), Univ Manchester, Fac Life Sci, Oxford Rd, Manchester M13 9PT, Lancs, England.",hilary.ashe@manchester.ac.uk,"Wang, Xiaomeng/F-9504-2015",,BBSRC project grant,"We thank M.

Sagittarius A* ( Sgr A*), the compact source of radio, infrared and X- ray emission at the centre of the Milky Way, is the closest example of this phenomenon, with an estimated black hole mass that is 4,000,000 times that of the Sun(2,3). A long- standing astronomical goal is to resolve structures in the innermost accretion flow surrounding Sgr A*, where strong gravitational fields will distort the appearance of radiation emitted near the black hole. Radio observations at wavelengths of 3.5 mm and 7 mm have detected intrinsic structure in Sgr A*, but the spatial resolution of observations at these wavelengths is limited by interstellar scattering(4-7). Here we report observations at a wavelength of 1.3 mm that set a size of 37(-10)(+16) microarcseconds on the intrinsic diameter of Sgr A*. This is less than the expected apparent size of the event horizon of the presumed black hole, suggesting that the bulk of Sgr A* emission may not be centred on the black hole, but arises in the surrounding accretion flow.","[Doeleman, Sheperd S.; Rogers, Alan E.

The layered crystal structure with transition- metal ions in planar square- lattice form and the discovery of spin- density- wave order near 130 K ( refs 10, 11) seem to hint at a strong similarity with the copper oxide superconductors. An important current issue is the nature of the ground state of the parent compounds. Two distinct classes of theories, distinguished by the underlying band structure, have been put forward: a local- moment antiferromagnetic ground state in the strong- coupling approach(12-17), and an itinerant ground state in the weak- coupling approach(18-22). The first approach stresses on-site correlations, proximity to a Mott- insulating state and, thus, the resemblance to the high- transition- temperature copper oxides, whereas the second approach emphasizes the itinerant- electron physics and the interplay between the competing ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic fluctuations. The debate over the two approaches is partly due to the lack of conclusive experimental information on the electronic structures. Here we report angle- resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( ARPES) of LaOFeP ( superconducting transition temperature, T-c = 5.9 K), the first- reported iron- based superconductor(2). Our results favour the itinerant ground state, albeit with band renormalization. In addition, our data reveal important differences between these and copper- based superconductors.","[Lu, D.

Emulsions occur in many forms of processing and are used extensively by the foods, cosmetics and coatings industries. Because of their compartmentalized internal structure, double emulsions can provide advantages over simple oil- in- water emulsions for encapsulation, such as the ability to carry both polar and non- polar cargos, and improved control over release of therapeutic molecules(4-6). The preparation of double emulsions typically requires mixtures of surfactants for stability; the formation of double nanoemulsions, where both inner and outer droplets are under 100 nm, has not yet been achieved(7-9). Here we show that water- in- oil- in- water double emulsions can be prepared in a simple process and stabilized over many months using single- component, synthetic amphiphilic diblock copolypeptide surfactants. These surfactants even stabilize droplets subjected to extreme flow, leading to direct, mass production of robust double nanoemulsions that are amenable to nanostructured encapsulation applications in foods, cosmetics and drug delivery.","[Hanson, Jarrod A.; Li, Zhibo; Deming, Timothy J.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Bioengn, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Chang, Connie B.; Graves, Sara M.; Mason, Thomas G.; Deming, Timothy J.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Chem & Biochem, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Mason, Thomas G.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Phys & Astron, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Mason, Thomas G.; Deming, Timothy J.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Calif Nanosyst Inst, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA","Deming, TJ (reprint author), Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Bioengn, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.",mason@chem.ucla.edu; demingt@seas.ucla.edu,"Deming, Timothy/I-5411-2013","Deming, Timothy/0000-0002-0594-5025",National Science Foundation; Human Frontiers of Science Program; University of California; National Institutes of Health; National Center for Research Resources P41 programme,"This work is supported by a grant from the National Science Foundation (T.J.D.), a grant from the Human Frontiers of Science Program (T.J.D.), and University of California start-up funds (T.J.D. and T.G.M.).

But ourmolecular- level understanding of its unusual and fast transport in water, and of the solvation patterns that allow fast transport, is far from complete. One proposal seeks to explain the properties and behaviour of the hydroxide ion by essentially regarding it as a water molecule that is missing a proton(2), and by inferring transport mechanisms and hydration structures from those of the excess proton. A competing proposal invokes instead unique and interchanging hydroxide hydration complexes, particularly the hypercoordinated OH-(H2O)(4) species and tri- coordinated OH-(H2O)(3) that can form a transient hydrogen bond between the H atom of the OH- and a neighbouring water molecule(3-5). Here we report measurements of core- level photoelectron emission and intermolecular Coulombic decay(6-8) for an aqueous hydroxide solution, which show that the hydrated hydroxide ion is capable of transiently donating a hydrogen bond to surrounding watermolecules. In agreement with recent experimental studies of hydroxide solutions(9-12), our finding thus supports the notion that the hydration structure of the hydroxide ion cannot be inferred from that of the hydrated excess proton.","[Aziz, Emad F.; Ottosson, Niklas; Winter, Bernd] BESSY, D-12489 Berlin, Germany; [Ottosson, Niklas] Uppsala Univ, Dept Phys, SE-75121 Uppsala, Sweden; [Faubel, Manfred] Max Planck Inst Dynam & Selbstorg, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany; [Hertel, Ingolf V.; Winter, Bernd] Max Born Inst Nichtlineare Opt & Kurzzeitspekt, D-12489 Berlin, Germany; [Hertel, Ingolf V.] Free Univ Berlin, Inst Expt Phys, D-14195 Berlin, Germany","Winter, B (reprint author), BESSY, Albert Einstein Str 15, D-12489 Berlin, Germany.",bernd.winter@bessy.de,"Winter, Bernd/D-4657-2011; Aziz, Emad/A-4463-2017","Aziz, Emad/0000-0003-1794-4350",,,,28,128,128,10,70,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,4-Sep,2008,455,7209,,,,,89,91,,10.1038/nature07252,,3,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,343XS,WOS:000258890200042,18769437,No,,,11/20/17

Over the rest of the tropics, however, possible trends in tropical cyclone intensity are less obvious, owing to the unreliability and incompleteness of the observational record and to a restricted focus, in previous trend analyses, on changes in average intensity. Here we overcome these two limitations by examining trends in the upper quantiles of per- cyclone maximum wind speeds ( that is, the maximum intensities that cyclones achieve during their lifetimes), estimated from homogeneous data derived from an archive of satellite records. We find significant upward trends for wind speed quantiles above the 70th percentile, with trends as high as 0.3 +/- 0.09 m s(-1) yr(-1) (s.e.) for the strongest cyclones. We note separate upward trends in the estimated lifetime-maximum wind speeds of the very strongest tropical cyclones ( 99th percentile) over each ocean basin, with the largest increase at this quantile occurring over the North Atlantic, although not all basins show statistically significant increases. Our results are qualitatively consistent with the hypothesis that as the seas warm, the ocean has more energy to convert to tropical cyclone wind.","[Elsner, James B.; Jagger, Thomas H.] Florida State Univ, Dept Geog, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA; [Kossin, James P.] Univ Wisconsin, Cooperat Inst Meteorol Satellite Studies, Madison, WI 53706 USA","Elsner, JB (reprint author), Florida State Univ, Dept Geog, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA.",jelsner@fsu.edu,"Jagger, Thomas/B-1713-2008; Kossin, James/D-3929-2011; Kossin, James/C-2022-2016","Jagger, Thomas/0000-0001-7823-3750; Kossin, James/0000-0003-0461-9794; Elsner, James/0000-0001-6805-7431","US National Science Foundation [ATM-0738172, ATM-0614812]; Risk Prediction Initiative of the Bermuda Institute for Ocean Studies [RPI06-3-001]",The work was supported by the US National Science Foundation (ATM-0738172 and ATM-0614812) and by the Risk Prediction Initiative of the Bermuda Institute for Ocean Studies (RPI06-3-001).,,25,375,384,18,104,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,4-Sep,2008,455,7209,,,,,92,95,,10.1038/nature07234,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,343XS,WOS:000258890200043,18769438,No,Y,N,11/20/17

Multimodal signals should vary in efficacy according to the sensory systems of different predators; however, until now, the impact of multiple predator classes on the evolution of these signals had not been investigated(2,3). Here, using a community- level molecular phylogeny to generate phylogenetically independent contrasts, we show that warning signals of tiger moths vary according to the seasonal and daily activity patterns of birds and bats - predators with divergent sensory capacities. Many tiger moths advertise chemical defence(4,5) using conspicuous colouration and/ or ultrasonic clicks(3,6). During spring, when birds are active and bats less so, we found that tiger moths did not produce ultrasonic clicks. Throughout both spring and summer, tiger moths most active during the day were visually conspicuous. Those species emerging later in the season produced ultrasonic clicks; those that were most nocturnal were visually cryptic. Our results indicate that selective pressures from multiple predator classes have distinct roles in the evolution of multimodal warning displays now effective against a single predator class. We also suggest that the evolution of acoustic warning signals may lack the theoretical difficulties associated with the origination of conspicuous colouration.","[Nydam, Marie L.] Cornell Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Ratcliffe, John M.] Univ So Denmark, Ctr Sound Commun, Inst Biol, DK-5230 Odense M, Denmark","Nydam, ML (reprint author), Cornell Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",jmr@biology.sdu.dk; mln32@cornell.edu,,,NSERC; NIDCD; DNSRC,"We thank R.

Acanthamoeba polyphaga mimivirus ( APMV) is the largest known virus; it grows only in amoeba and is visible under the optical microscope. Mimivirus possesses a 1,185- kilobase double- stranded linear chromosome whose coding capacity is greater than that of numerous bacteria and archaea(1-3). Here we describe an icosahedral small virus, Sputnik, 50 nm in size, found associated with a new strain of APMV. Sputnik cannot multiply in Acanthamoeba castellanii but grows rapidly, after an eclipse phase, in the giant virus factory found in amoebae co- infected with APMV(4). Sputnik growth is deleterious to APMV and results in the production of abortive forms and abnormal capsid assembly of the host virus. The Sputnik genome is an 18.343- kilobase circular double- stranded DNA and contains genes that are linked to viruses infecting each of the three domains of life Eukarya, Archaea and Bacteria. Of the 21 predicted protein- coding genes, eight encode proteins with detectable homologues, including three proteins apparently derived from APMV, a homologue of an archaeal virus integrase, a predicted primase helicase, a packaging ATPase with homologues in bacteriophages and eukaryotic viruses, a distant homologue of bacterial insertion sequence transposase DNA- binding subunit, and a Zn- ribbon protein. The closest homologues of the last four of these proteins were detected in the Global Ocean Survey environmental data set(5), suggesting that Sputnik represents a currently unknown family of viruses. Considering its functional analogy with bacteriophages, we classify this virus as a virophage. The virophage could be a vehicle mediating lateral gene transfer between giant viruses.","[La Scola, Bernard; Desnues, Christelle; Pagnier, Isabelle; Robert, Catherine; Barrassi, Lina; Fournous, Ghislain; Suzan-Monti, Marie; Raoult, Didier] Univ Aix Marseille 2, URMITE, Ctr Natl Rech Sci, Fac Med,UMR IRD 6236, F-13385 Marseille 5, France; [Merchat, Michele] Climespace, F-75012 Paris, France; [Forterre, Patrick] Univ Paris 11, Ctr Orsay, Inst Microbiol & Genet, F-91405 Orsay, France; [Forterre, Patrick] Inst Pasteur, Dept Microbiol, F-75724 Paris 15, France; [Koonin, Eugene] NIH, Natl Ctr Biotechnol Informat, Natl Lib Med, Bethesda, MD 20894 USA","Raoult, D (reprint author), Univ Aix Marseille 2, URMITE, Ctr Natl Rech Sci, Fac Med,UMR IRD 6236, 27 Blvd Jean Moulin, F-13385 Marseille 5, France.",didier.raoult@gmail.com,"Desnues, Christelle/B-1383-2010; LA SCOLA, Bernard/P-6477-2016","Desnues, Christelle/0000-0002-2178-0355; LA SCOLA, Bernard/0000-0001-8006-7704; Pagnier, Isabelle/0000-0002-1724-3450",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique; CIFFRE fellowship; Intramural Research Program of the National Institutes of Health; National Library of Medicine; Institut Universitaire de France,"We thank X. de Lamballerie, S.

Here we investigate the distribution of single- nucleotide changes around insertions/ deletions ( indels) in six independent genome comparisons, including primates, rodents, fruitfly, rice and yeast. In each of these genomic comparisons, nucleotide divergence ( D) is substantially elevated surrounding indels and decreases monotonically to near-background levels over several hundred bases. D is significantly correlated with both size and abundance of nearby indels. In comparisons of closely related species, derived nucleotide substitutions surrounding indels occur in significantly greater numbers in the lineage containing the indel than in the one containing the ancestral ( non- indel) allele; the same holds within species for single- nucleotide mutations surrounding polymorphic indels. We propose that heterozygosity for an indel is mutagenic to surrounding sequences, and use yeast genome- wide polymorphism data to estimate the increase in mutation rate. The consistency of these patterns within and between species suggests that indel- associated substitution is a general mutational mechanism.","[Tian, Dacheng; Wang, Qiang; Zhang, Pengfei; Araki, Hitoshi; Yang, Sihai; Bergelson, Joy; Chen, Jian-Qun] Nanjing Univ, State Key Lab Pharmaceut Biotechnol, Dept Biol, Nanjing 210093, Peoples R China; [Araki, Hitoshi] EAWAG Ctr Ecol Evolut & Biogeochem, Dept Fish Ecol & Evolut, CH-6047 Kastanienbaum, Switzerland; [Kreitman, Martin; Nagylaki, Thomas; Hudson, Richard; Bergelson, Joy] Univ Chicago, Dept Ecol & Evolut, Chicago, IL 60637 USA","Tian, DC (reprint author), Nanjing Univ, State Key Lab Pharmaceut Biotechnol, Dept Biol, Nanjing 210093, Peoples R China.",dtian@nju.edu.cn; chenjq@nju.edu.cn,"Yang, Sihai/A-1434-2013",,"NSFC [30470924, 30470122, 30570987]; NBRPC [2005CCA02100]; 111 Project","We thank A.

Env is a heterodimer of a transmembrane glycoprotein (gp41) and a surface glycoprotein ( gp120), and forms trimers on the surface of the viral membrane. Using cryo- electron tomography combined with three- dimensional image classification and averaging, we report the three- dimensional structures of trimeric Env displayed on native HIV- 1 in the unliganded state, in complex with the broadly neutralizing antibody b12 and in a ternary complex with CD4 and the 17b antibody. By fitting the known crystal structures(2,3) of the monomeric gp120 core in the b12- and CD4/17b-bound conformations into the density maps derived by electron tomography, we derive molecular models for the native HIV- 1 gp120 trimer in unliganded and CD4- bound states. We demonstrate that CD4 binding results in a major reorganization of the Env trimer, causing an outward rotation and displacement of each gp120 monomer. This appears to be coupled with a rearrangement of the gp41 region along the central axis of the trimer, leading to closer contact between the viral and target cell membranes.

How cell migration is coordinately regulated with other aspects of neuron production is not well understood. Here we show that the proneural protein neurogenin 2 ( Neurog2), which controls neurogenesis in the embryonic cerebral cortex(1,2), directly induces the expression of the small GTP- binding protein Rnd2 ( ref. 3) in newly generated mouse cortical neurons before they initiate migration. Rnd2 silencing leads to a defect in radial migration of cortical neurons similar to that observed when the Neurog2 gene is deleted. Remarkably, restoring Rnd2 expression in Neurog2- mutant neurons is sufficient to rescue their ability to migrate. Our results identify Rnd2 as a novel essential regulator of neuronal migration in the cerebral cortex and demonstrate that Rnd2 is a major effector of Neurog2 function in the promotion of migration. Thus, a proneural protein controls the complex cellular behaviour of cell migration through a remarkably direct pathway involving the transcriptional activation of a small GTP- binding protein.","[Heng, Julian Ik-Tsen; Nguyen, Laurent; Castro, Diogo S.; Zimmer, Celine; Wildner, Hendrik; Armant, Olivier; Guillemot, Francois] Natl Inst Med Res, Div Mol Neurobiol, London NW7 1AA, England; [Skowronska-Krawczyk, Dorota; Matter, Jean-Marc] Univ Geneva, Dept Biochem, CH-1211 Geneva 4, Switzerland; [Bedogni, Francesco; Hevner, Robert] Univ Washington, Harborview Med Ctr, Sch Med, Dept Pathol, Seattle, WA 98104 USA","Guillemot, F (reprint author), Natl Inst Med Res, Div Mol Neurobiol, Mill Hill, London NW7 1AA, England.",fguille@nimr.mrc.ac.uk,,"Heng, Julian Ik-Tsen/0000-0002-0378-7078; bedogni, francesco/0000-0002-6651-0041; Castro, Diogo/0000-0001-8178-9565; armant, olivier/0000-0001-7101-9209",Australian CJ Martin Fellowship [310616]; Medical Research Council career development fellowship; European Molecular Biology Organization; Medical Research Council career development fellowships; European Commission 6th Framework Programme for Research and Technological Development; Medical Research Council,"We are grateful to S.

Here we show that in human cells PLK1 activation occurs several hours before entry into mitosis, and requires aurora A ( AURKA, also known as STK6)- dependent phosphorylation of Thr 210. We find that aurora A can directly phosphorylate PLK1 on Thr 210, and that activity of aurora A towards PLK1 is greatly enhanced by Bora ( also known as C13orf34 and FLJ22624), a known cofactor for aurora A ( ref. 7). We show that Bora/ aurora- A- dependent phosphorylation is a prerequisite for PLK1 to promote mitotic entry after a checkpoint- dependent arrest. Importantly, expression of a PLK1- T210D phospho- mimicking mutant partially overcomes the requirement for aurora A in checkpoint recovery. Taken together, these data demonstrate that the initial activation of PLK1 is a primary function of aurora A.","[Macurek, Libor; Lindqvist, Arne; Klompmaker, Rob; Medema, Rene H.] Univ Med Ctr Utrecht, Dept Med Oncol, NL-3584 CG Utrecht, Netherlands; [Lim, Dan; Clouin, Christophe; Yaffe, Michael B.] MIT, Ctr Canc Res, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Lampson, Michael A.] Univ Penn, Dept Biol, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Freire, Raimundo] Hosp Univ Canarias, Unidad Invest, La Cuesta 38320, Spain; [Taylor, Stephen S.] Univ Manchester, Fac Life Sci, Manchester M13 9PT, Lancs, England","Medema, RH (reprint author), Univ Med Ctr Utrecht, Dept Med Oncol, NL-3584 CG Utrecht, Netherlands.",r.h.medema@umcutrecht.nl,"Lindqvist, Arne/B-6792-2008; Macurek, Libor/B-8758-2009","Taylor, Stephen/0000-0003-4621-9326; Medema, Rene/0000-0002-6754-0381; Lindqvist, Arne/0000-0002-0141-1579","Dutch Cancer Society [UU2006-3579]; Dutch Organisation for Scientific Research [ZonMw 918.46.616, ZonMw 916.86.083]; Association for International Cancer Research [08-0172]; NIH [GM-60594, CA112967]; Wenner-Gren foundations; Netherlands Genomic Initiative of the Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research (NWO).","We are thankful to B.

This processive, two- headed motor takes multiple 36- nm steps in which the two heads swing forward alternately towards the barbed end of actin driven by ATP hydrolysis(2). The ability of myosin Va to move processively is a function of its long lever arm, the high duty ratio of its kinetic cycle and the gating of the kinetics between the two heads such that ADP release from the lead head is greatly retarded(3-10). Mechanical studies at the multiple- and the single- molecule level suggest that there is tight coupling ( that is, one ATP is hydrolysed per power stroke), but this has not been directly demonstrated(4,5,11). We therefore investigated the coordination between the ATPase mechanism of the two heads of myosin Va and directly visualized the binding and dissociation of single fluorescently labelled nucleotide molecules, while simultaneously observing the stepping motion of the fluorescently labelled myosin Va as it moved along an actin filament. Here we show that preferential ADP dissociation from the trail head of mouse myosin Va is followed by ATP binding and a synchronous 36- nm step. Even at low ATP concentrations, the myosin Va molecule retained at least one nucleotide ( ADP in the lead head position) when moving.

Removing a small fraction of these electrons ( hole doping) transforms this system into a superconducting fluid of delocalized Cooper pairs in momentum space ( k- space). During this transformation, two distinctive classes of electronic excitations appear. At high energies, the mysterious 'pseudogap' excitations are found, whereas, at lower energies, Bogoliubov quasi- particles - the excitations resulting from the breaking of Cooper pairs should exist. To explore this transformation, and to identify the two excitation types, we have imaged the electronic structure of Bi(2)Sr(2)CaCu(2)O(8+delta) in r- space and k- space simultaneously. We find that although the low- energy excitations are indeed Bogoliubov quasi- particles, they occupy only a restricted region of k- space that shrinks rapidly with diminishing hole density. Concomitantly, spectral weight is transferred to higher energy r- space states that lack the characteristics of excitations from delocalized Cooper pairs. Instead, these states break translational and rotational symmetries locally at the atomic scale in an energy- independent way. We demonstrate that these unusual r- space excitations are, in fact, the pseudogap states. Thus, as the Mott insulating state is approached by decreasing the hole density, the delocalized Cooper pairs vanish from k- space, to be replaced by locally translational- and rotational- symmetry- breaking pseudogap states in r- space.","[Kohsaka, Y.; Taylor, C.; Wahl, P.; Schmidt, A.; Lee, Jhinhwan; Fujita, K.; Alldredge, J.

These preferences are important for a unique aspect of human sociality - large scale cooperation with genetic strangers but little is known about their developmental roots. Here we show that young children's other- regarding preferences assume a particular form, inequality aversion that develops strongly between the ages of 3 and 8. At age 3 - 4, the overwhelming majority of children behave selfishly, whereas most children at age 7 - 8 prefer resource allocations that remove advantageous or disadvantageous inequality. Moreover, inequality aversion is strongly shaped by parochialism, a preference for favouring the members of one's own social group. These results indicate that human egalitarianism and parochialism have deep developmental roots, and the simultaneous emergence of altruistic sharing and parochialism during childhood is intriguing in view of recent evolutionary theories which predict that the same evolutionary process jointly drives both human altruism and parochialism.","[Fehr, Ernst; Bernhard, Helen] Univ Zurich, Inst Empir Res Econ, CH-8006 Zurich, Switzerland; [Fehr, Ernst] Coll Helveticum, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland; [Rockenbach, Bettina] Univ Erfurt, D-99089 Erfurt, Germany","Fehr, E (reprint author), Univ Zurich, Inst Empir Res Econ, Blumlisalpstr 10, CH-8006 Zurich, Switzerland.",efehr@iew.uzh.ch; bettina.rockenbach@uni-erfurt.de,"Rockenbach, Bettina/B-5447-2016","Rockenbach, Bettina/0000-0003-2624-1964",Foundations of Human Social Behaviour-Altruism versus Egoism' at the University of Zurich; Swiss National Science Foundation,"This paper is part of the Research Priority Program 'Foundations of Human Social Behaviour-Altruism versus Egoism' at the University of Zurich and of the Swiss National Competence Center in research on affective sciences, which is financed by the Swiss National Science Foundation.

Viral infections are a substantial source of mortality in a range of organisms - including autotrophic and heterotrophic plankton - but their impact on the deep ocean and benthic biosphere is completely unknown. Here we report that viral production in deep- sea benthic ecosystems worldwide is extremely high, and that viral infections are responsible for the abatement of 80% of prokaryotic heterotrophic production. Virus- induced prokaryotic mortality increases with increasing water depth, and beneath a depth of 1,000 m nearly all of the prokaryotic heterotrophic production is transformed into organic detritus. The viral shunt, releasing on a global scale similar to 0.37 - 0.63 gigatonnes of carbon per year, is an essential source of labile organic detritus in the deep- sea ecosystems. This process sustains a high prokaryotic biomass and provides an important contribution to prokaryotic metabolism, allowing the system to cope with the severe organic resource limitation of deep- sea ecosystems. Our results indicate that viruses have an important role in global biogeochemical cycles, in deep- sea metabolism and the overall functioning of the largest ecosystem of our biosphere.","[Danovaro, Roberto; Dell'Anno, Antonio; Corinaldesi, Cinzia; Magagnini, Mirko] Polytech Univ Marche, Dept Marine Sci, Fac Sci, I-60131 Ancona, Italy; [Noble, Rachel] Univ N Carolina, Inst Marine Sci, Morehead City, NC 28557 USA; [Tamburini, Christian] Univ Aix Marseille 2, Ctr Oceanol Marseille, CNRS, UMR 6117, F-13288 Marseille 9, France; [Weinbauer, Markus] CNRS, F-06234 Villefranche Sur Mer, France; [Weinbauer, Markus] Lab Oceanog Villefranche, Microbial Ecol & Biogeochem Grp, F-06234 Villefranche Sur Mer, France; [Weinbauer, Markus] Univ Paris 06, Lab Oceanog Villefranche, F-06234 Villefranche Sur Mer, France","Danovaro, R (reprint author), Polytech Univ Marche, Dept Marine Sci, Fac Sci, Via Brecce Bianche, I-60131 Ancona, Italy.",r.danovaro@univpm.it,"Weinbauer, Markus/G-8038-2011; Biblio, LOV/K-9251-2017","Dell'Anno, Antonio/0000-0002-4324-7834; Tamburini, Christian/0000-0003-3752-7423",project HERMES; ANR POTES,This work was financially supported by the EU within the framework of the project HERMES.

Here we examine the formation of misfolded protein inclusions in the eukaryotic cytosol of yeast and mammalian cell culture models. We identify two intracellular compartments for the sequestration of misfolded cytosolic proteins. Partition of quality control substrates to either compartment seems to depend on their ubiquitination status and aggregation state. Soluble ubiquitinated misfolded proteins accumulate in a juxtanuclear compartment where proteasomes are concentrated. In contrast, terminally aggregated proteins are sequestered in a perivacuolar inclusion. Notably, disease- associated Huntingtin and prion proteins are preferentially directed to the perivacuolar compartment. Enhancing ubiquitination of a prion protein suffices to promote its delivery to the juxtanuclear inclusion. Our findings provide a framework for understanding the preferential accumulation of amyloidogenic proteins in inclusions linked to human disease.","[Kaganovich, Daniel; Kopito, Ron; Frydman, Judith] Stanford Univ, Dept Biol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Kaganovich, Daniel; Kopito, Ron; Frydman, Judith] Stanford Univ, BioX Program, Stanford, CA 94305 USA","Frydman, J (reprint author), Stanford Univ, Dept Biol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",jfrydman@stanford.edu,"Kaganovich, Daniel/K-2376-2012","Kaganovich, Daniel/0000-0003-2398-1596",NIH,"We thank R.

A determination of the mass of these galaxies provides a test of galaxy formation at the smallest scales(3,4) and probes the nature of the dark matter that dominates the mass density of the Universe(5).

Large- scale quantum communication(1-4) ( of the order of 100 km) has been achieved; however, serious problems occur beyond this distance scale, mainly due to inevitable photon loss in the transmission channel. Quantum communication eventually fails(5) when the probability of a dark count in the photon detectors becomes comparable to the probability that a photon is correctly detected. To overcome this problem, Briegel, Dur, Cirac and Zoller ( BDCZ) introduced the concept of quantum repeaters(6), combining entanglement swapping(7) and quantum memory to efficiently extend the achievable distances. Although entanglement swapping has been experimentally demonstrated(8), the implementation of BDCZ quantum repeaters has proved challenging owing to the difficulty of integrating a quantum memory. Here we realize entanglement swapping with storage and retrieval of light, a building block of the BDCZ quantum repeater. We follow a scheme(9,10) that incorporates the strategy of BDCZ with atomic quantum memories(11). Two atomic ensembles, each originally entangled with a single emitted photon, are projected into an entangled state by performing a joint Bell state measurement on the two single photons after they have passed through a 300- m fibre- based communication channel. The entanglement is stored in the atomic ensembles and later verified by converting the atomic excitations into photons. Our method is intrinsically phase insensitive and establishes the essential element needed to realize quantum repeaters with stationary atomic qubits as quantum memories and flying photonic qubits as quantum messengers.","[Yuan, Zhen-Sheng; Chen, Yu-Ao; Zhao, Bo; Chen, Shuai; Pan, Jian-Wei] Univ Heidelberg, Inst Phys, D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany; [Yuan, Zhen-Sheng; Chen, Yu-Ao; Pan, Jian-Wei] Univ Sci & Technol China, Hefei Natl Lab Phys Sci Microscale, Anhua 230026, Peoples R China; [Yuan, Zhen-Sheng; Chen, Yu-Ao; Pan, Jian-Wei] Univ Sci & Technol China, Dept Modern Phys, Anhua 230026, Peoples R China; [Schmiedmayer, Joerg] Vienna Univ Technol, Atominst Osterreichischen Univ, A-1020 Vienna, Austria","Chen, YA (reprint author), Univ Heidelberg, Inst Phys, Philosophenweg 12, D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany.",yuao@physi.uni-heidelberg.de; jian-wei.pan@physi.uni-heidelberg.de,"Schmiedmayer, Jorg/B-4717-2008; Yuan, Zhen-Sheng/A-1061-2010; Pan, Jian-Wei/A-2332-2010; Chen, Yu-Ao/B-2057-2013; zhao, bo/M-8471-2017","Schmiedmayer, Jorg/0000-0001-7799-5614; Yuan, Zhen-Sheng/0000-0003-4580-8225; Pan, Jian-Wei/0000-0002-6100-5142; ","Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation; Marie Curie Excellence Grant; ERC Grant; National Fundamental Research Program [2006CB921900]; CAS; NNSFC","We thank W.

Several hypotheses have been proposed to explain this increase in Northern Hemisphere glaciation during the Late Pliocene(5-11). Here we use a fully coupled atmosphere - ocean general circulation model and an ice- sheet model to assess the impact of the proposed driving mechanisms for glaciation and the influence of orbital variations on the development of the Greenland ice sheet in particular. We find that Greenland glaciation is mainly controlled by a decrease in atmospheric carbon dioxide during the Late Pliocene. By contrast, our model results suggest that climatic shifts associated with the tectonically driven closure of the Panama seaway(5,6), with the termination of a permanent El Nino state(7-9) or with tectonic uplift(10) are not large enough to contribute significantly to the growth of the Greenland ice sheet; moreover, we find that none of these processes acted as a priming mechanism for glacial inception triggered by variations in the Earth's orbit.","[Lunt, Daniel J.; Stone, Emma J.] Univ Bristol, BRIDGE, Sch Geog Sci, Bristol BS8 1SS, Avon, England; [Lunt, Daniel J.] British Antarctic Survey, Geol Sci Div, Cambridge CB3 0ET, England; [Foster, Gavin L.] Univ Bristol, Dept Earth Sci, Bristol Isotope Grp, Bristol BS8 1RJ, Avon, England; [Haywood, Alan M.] Univ Leeds, Sch Earth & Environm, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England","Lunt, DJ (reprint author), Univ Bristol, BRIDGE, Sch Geog Sci, Univ Rd, Bristol BS8 1SS, Avon, England.",d.j.lunt@bristol.ac.uk,"Lunt, Daniel/G-9451-2011; Stone, Emma/H-9549-2012","Lunt, Daniel/0000-0003-3585-6928; Stone, Emma/0000-0002-8633-8074",GEACEP (Greenhouse to ice-house: Evolution of the Antarctic Cryosphere and Palaeoenvironment) programme; BAS fellowship; RCUK fellowship; NERC research fellowship,This work was carried out in the framework of the British Antarctic Survey GEACEP (Greenhouse to ice-house: Evolution of the Antarctic Cryosphere and Palaeoenvironment) programme.

Difficulties in simulating the geodynamo arise from the extreme conditions of the core, which are characterized by very large or very small values of the non- dimensional parameters of the system. Among them, the Ekman number, E, has been adopted as a barometer of the distance of simulations from real core conditions, in which E is of the order of 10(-15). Following the initial computer simulations of the geodynamo(4,5), the Ekman number achieved has been steadily decreasing, with recent geodynamo simulations(6-8) performed with E of the order of 10(-6). Here we present a geodynamo simulation with an Ekman number of the order of 10(-7)-the highest-resolution simulation yet achieved, making use of 4,096 processors of the Earth Simulator. We have found that both the convection flow and magnetic field structures are qualitatively different from those found in larger- Ekman- number dynamos. The convection takes the form of sheet plumes or radial sheet jets(9), rather than the columnar cell structures(10) that are usually found. We have found that this sheet plume convection is an effective dynamo and the generated current is organized as a set of coils in the shape of helical springs or at times as a torus.","[Kageyama, Akira; Miyagoshi, Takehiro; Sato, Tetsuya] Japan Agcy Marine Earth Sci & Technol, Earth Simulator Ctr, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2360001, Japan","Kageyama, A (reprint author), Japan Agcy Marine Earth Sci & Technol, Earth Simulator Ctr, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2360001, Japan.",kage@jamstec.go.jp,"Kageyama, Akira/H-4537-2013","Kageyama, Akira/0000-0003-0433-668X",KAKENHI [17540404]; The Mitsubishi Foundation,"We thank P.

Although these effects are well studied, their cellular mechanisms are poorly understood. To study the cellular mechanisms, we combined iontophoretic pharmacological analysis of cholinergic receptors with single cell recordings in V1 while rhesus macaque monkeys ( Macaca mulatta) performed a task that demanded top- down spatial attention. Attending to the receptive field of the V1 neuron under study caused an increase in firing rates. Here we show that this attentional modulation was enhanced by low doses of acetylcholine. Furthermore, applying the muscarinic antagonist scopolamine reduced attentional modulation, whereas the nicotinic antagonist mecamylamine had no systematic effect. These results demonstrate that muscarinic cholinergic mechanisms play a central part in mediating the effects of attention in V1.","[Herrero, J. L.; Roberts, M. J.; Delicato, L. S.; Gieselmann, M.

In the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, population density is monitored through specific glycosides of the dideoxysugar ascarylose ( the 'ascarosides') that promote entry into an alternative larval stage, the non- feeding and highly persistent dauer stage(3,4). In addition, adult C. elegans males are attracted to hermaphrodites by a previously unidentified small- molecule signal(5,6). Here we show, by means of combinatorial activity- guided fractionation of the C. elegans metabolome, that the mating signal consists of a synergistic blend of three dauer- inducing ascarosides, which we call ascr#2, ascr#3 and ascr#4. This blend of ascarosides acts as a potent male attractant at very low concentrations, whereas at the higher concentrations required for dauer formation the compounds no longer attract males and instead deter hermaphrodites. The ascarosides ascr#2 and ascr# 3 carry different, but overlapping, information, as ascr# 3 is more potent as a male attractant than ascr#2 , whereas ascr# 2 is slightly more potent than ascr# 3 in promoting dauer formation(7). We demonstrate that ascr# 2, ascr# 3 and ascr# 4 are strongly synergistic, and that two types of neuron, the amphid single- ciliated sensory neuron type K ( ASK) and the male- specific cephalic companion neuron ( CEM), are required for male attraction by ascr#3. On the basis of these results, male attraction and dauer formation in C. elegans appear as alternative behavioural responses to a common set of signalling molecules. The ascaroside signalling system thus connects reproductive and developmental pathways and represents a unique example of structure- and concentration-dependent differential activity of signalling molecules.","[Srinivasan, Jagan; Sternberg, Paul W.] CALTECH, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA; [Srinivasan, Jagan; Sternberg, Paul W.] CALTECH, Div Biol, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA; [Kaplan, Fatma; Ajredini, Ramadan; Zachariah, Cherian; Edison, Arthur S.] Univ Florida, Dept Biochem & Mol Biol, Gainesville, FL 32610 USA; [Kaplan, Fatma; Ajredini, Ramadan; Zachariah, Cherian; Edison, Arthur S.] Univ Florida, McKnight Brain Inst, Gainesville, FL 32610 USA; [Kaplan, Fatma; Ajredini, Ramadan; Zachariah, Cherian; Edison, Arthur S.] Univ Florida, Natl High Magnet Field Lab, Gainesville, FL 32610 USA; [Alborn, Hans T.; Teal, Peter E.

Gene- regulatory networks often mediate the cellular response to perturbation(1-3), and an understanding of cellular adaptation will require experimental approaches aimed at subjecting cells to a dynamic environment that mimics their natural habitat(4-9). Here we monitor the response of Saccharomyces cerevisiae metabolic gene regulation to periodic changes in the external carbon source by using a microfluidic platform that allows precise, dynamic control over environmental conditions. We show that the metabolic system acts as a low- pass filter that reliably responds to a slowly changing environment, while effectively ignoring fast fluctuations. The sensitive low- frequency response was significantly faster than in predictions arising from our computational modelling, and this discrepancy was resolved by the discovery that two key galactose transcripts possess half- lives that depend on the carbon source. Finally, to explore how induction characteristics affect frequency response, we compare two S. cerevisiae strains and show that they have the same frequency response despite having markedly different induction properties. This suggests that although certain characteristics of the complex networks may differ when probed in a static environment, the system has been optimized for a robust response to a dynamically changing environment.","[Bennett, Matthew R.; Pang, Wyming Lee; Ostroff, Natalie A.; Baumgartner, Bridget L.; Nayak, Sujata; Hasty, Jeff] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Bioengn, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Bennett, Matthew R.; Tsimring, Lev S.; Hasty, Jeff] Univ Calif San Diego, Inst Nonlinear Sci, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA","Hasty, J (reprint author), Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Bioengn, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.",hasty@ucsd.edu,"Bennett, Matthew/B-3700-2008","Bennett, Matthew/0000-0002-4975-8854",National Institute of General Medical Sciences of the National Institutes of Health,"We thank A.

Elucidation of the underlying mechanisms of viral replication is critical for development of anti- influenza virus drugs(2). The influenza RNA- dependent RNA polymerase ( RdRp) heterotrimer has crucial roles in viral RNA replication and transcription. It contains three proteins: PA, PB1 and PB2. PB1 harbours polymerase and endonuclease activities and PB2 is responsible for cap binding(3,4); PA is implicated in RNA replication(5-10) and proteolytic activity(11-14), although its function is less clearly defined. Here we report the 2.9 angstrom structure of avian H5N1 influenza A virus PA ( PA(C), residues 257 - 716) in complex with the PA- binding region of PB1 ( PB1(N), residues 1 - 25). PA(C) has a fold resembling a dragon's head with PB1(N) clamped into its open 'jaws'. PB1(N) is a known inhibitor that blocks assembly of the polymerase heterotrimer and abolishes viral replication. Our structure provides details for the binding of PB1(N) to PA(C) at the atomic level, demonstrating a potential target for novel anti- influenza therapeutics. We also discuss a potential nucleotide binding site and the roles of some known residues involved in polymerase activity. Furthermore, to explore the role of PA in viral replication and transcription, we propose a model for the influenza RdRp heterotrimer by comparing PA(C) with the lambda 3 reovirus polymerase structure, and docking the PA(C) structure into an available low resolution electron microscopy map.","[He, Xiaojing; Zhou, Jie; Ma, Jianyuan; Li, Xuemei; Li, Jingjing; Zeng, Zonghao; Rao, Zihe; Liu, Yingfang] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Biophys, Natl Lab Biomacromol, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Bartlam, Mark; Rao, Zihe] Nankai Univ, Coll Life Sci, Tianjin 300071, Peoples R China; [Bartlam, Mark; Rao, Zihe] Nankai Univ, Tianjin State Lab Prot Sci, Tianjin 300071, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Rongguang; Joachimiak, Andrzej] Argonne Natl Lab, Midwest Ctr Struct Genom, Biosci Div, Argonne, IL 60439 USA; [Zhang, Rongguang; Joachimiak, Andrzej] Argonne Natl Lab, Struct Biol Ctr, Biosci Div, Argonne, IL 60439 USA; [Lou, Zhiyong; Li, Xuemei; Rao, Zihe] Tsinghua Univ, Struct Biol Lab, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China; [Ge, Ruowen] Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Biol Sci, Singapore 117543, Singapore","Rao, ZH (reprint author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Biophys, Natl Lab Biomacromol, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China.",raozh@xtal.tsinghua.edu.cn; liuy@ibp.ac.cn,"Ge, Ruowen/D-8352-2012; HE, XIAOJING/A-6040-2013","Ge, Ruowen/0000-0002-0750-7336; Bartlam, Mark/0000-0001-5173-5080","National Natural Science Foundation of China [30599432, 30221003]; Ministry of Science and Technology International Cooperation Project [2006DFB32420]; Ministry of Science and Technology 863 Project [2006AA02A314, 2006AA02A322]; Ministry of Science and Technology 973 Project [2006CB504300, 2007CB914300]","We thank H.

The recent emergence in Asia of avian influenza related to highly pathogenic forms of the human virus has highlighted the urgent need for new effective treatments(1). Here we demonstrate the importance to viral replication of a subunit interface in the viral RNA polymerase, thereby providing a new set of potential drug binding sites entirely independent of surface antigen type. No current medication targets this heterotrimeric polymerase complex. All three subunits, PB1, PB2 and PA, are required for both transcription and replication(2-4). PB1 carries the polymerase active site, PB2 includes the capped- RNA recognition domain, and PA is involved in assembly of the functional complex(5-7), but so far very little structural information has been reported for any of them(8-11). We describe the crystal structure of a large fragment of one subunit ( PA) of influenza A RNA polymerase bound to a fragment of another subunit ( PB1). The carboxy- terminal domain of PA forms a novel fold, and forms a deep, highly hydrophobic groove into which the amino- terminal residues of PB1 can fit by forming a 3(10) helix.","[Obayashi, Eiji; Yoshida, Hisashi; Kawai, Fumihiro; Tame, Jeremy R.

Therefore, tight control of niche number, size and function is necessary to ensure the proper balance between stem cells and progenitor cells available for tissue homeostasis and wound repair. The stem cell niche in the Drosophila male gonad is located at the tip of the testis where germline and somatic stem cells surround the apical hub, a cluster of approximately 10 - 15 somatic cells that is required for stem cell self- renewal and maintenance(2-4). Here we show that somatic stem cells in the Drosophila testis contribute to both the apical hub and the somatic cyst cell lineage. The Drosophila orthologue of epithelial cadherin ( DE- cadherin) is required for somatic stem cell maintenance and, consequently, the apical hub. Furthermore, our data indicate that the transcriptional repressor escargot regulates the ability of somatic cells to assume and/ or maintain hub cell identity. These data highlight the dynamic relationship between stem cells and the niche and provide insight into genetic programmes that regulate niche size and function to support normal tissue homeostasis and organ regeneration throughout life.","[Voog, Justin; D'Alterio, Cecilia; Jones, D.

Whereas C. elegans(3) and Drosophila melanogaster(4,5) have a single E2F activator protein and repressor protein, mammals have at least three activator and five repressor proteins(1,2,6). Why such genetic complexity evolved in mammals is not known. To begin to evaluate this genetic complexity, we targeted the inactivation of the entire subset of activators, E2f1, E2f2, E2f3a and E2f3b, singly or in combination in mice. We demonstrate that E2f3a is sufficient to support mouse embryonic and postnatal development. Remarkably, expression of E2f3b or E2f1 from the E2f3a locus ( E2f3a(3bki) or E2f3a(1ki), respectively) suppressed all the postnatal phenotypes associated with the inactivation of E2f3a. We conclude that there is significant functional redundancy among activators and that the specific requirement for E2f3a during postnatal development is dictated by regulatory sequences governing its selective spatiotemporal expression and not by its intrinsic protein functions. These findings provide a molecular basis for the observed specificity among E2F activators during development.","[Tsai, Shih-Yin; Opavsky, Rene; Sharma, Nidhi; Wu, Lizhao; Nolan, Eric; Feria-Arias, Enrique; Timmers, Cynthia; Opavska, Jana; de Bruin, Alain; Chong, Jean-Leon; Trikha, Prashant; Leone, Gustavo] Ohio State Univ, Dept Mol Genet, Coll Biol Sci, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Tsai, Shih-Yin; Opavsky, Rene; Sharma, Nidhi; Wu, Lizhao; Naidu, Shan; Nolan, Eric; Feria-Arias, Enrique; Timmers, Cynthia; Opavska, Jana; de Bruin, Alain; Chong, Jean-Leon; Trikha, Prashant; Leone, Gustavo] Ohio State Univ, Ctr Comprehens Canc, Human Canc Genet Program, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Tsai, Shih-Yin; Opavsky, Rene; Sharma, Nidhi; Wu, Lizhao; Naidu, Shan; Nolan, Eric; Feria-Arias, Enrique; Timmers, Cynthia; Opavska, Jana; de Bruin, Alain; Chong, Jean-Leon; Trikha, Prashant; Leone, Gustavo] Ohio State Univ, Dept Mol Virol Immunol & Med Genet, Coll Med, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Naidu, Shan; Stromberg, Paul; Rosol, Thomas J.] Ohio State Univ, Dept Vet Biosci, Coll Vet Med, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Fernandez, Soledad A.] Ohio State Univ, Ctr Biostat, Columbus, OH 43210 USA","Leone, G (reprint author), Ohio State Univ, Dept Mol Genet, Coll Biol Sci, 484 W 12Th Ave, Columbus, OH 43210 USA.",Gustavo.Leone@osumc.edu,"Rosol, Thomas/G-9585-2011; Trikha, Prashant/B-5897-2012","Rosol, Thomas/0000-0003-3737-1190; ","NIH [R01CA85619, R01HD042619, R01CA121275, R01HD047470, P01CA097189, K01CA102328]; DoD awards [BC0300893, BC061730]; T32 fellowship [CA106196]; Pew Charitable Trusts Scholar Award; Leukemia and Lymphoma Society Scholar Award","We thank J.

It can be loaded onto secreted and endomembrane cuproproteins by translocation from the cytosol into membrane- bound organelles by ATP7A or ATP7B transporters, the genes for which are mutated in the copper imbalance syndromes Menkes disease and Wilson disease, respectively(2). Endomembrane cuproproteins are thought to incorporate copper stably on transit through the trans-Golgi network, in which ATP7A accumulates(3) by dynamic cycling through early endocytic compartments(4). Here we show that the pigment- cell- specific cuproenzyme tyrosinase acquires copper only transiently and inefficiently within the trans- Golgi network of mouse melanocytes. To catalyse melanin synthesis, tyrosinase is subsequently reloaded with copper within specialized organelles called melanosomes. Copper is supplied to melanosomes by ATP7A, a cohort of which localizes to melanosomes in a biogenesis of lysosome- related organelles complex-1 ( BLOC-1)- dependent manner. These results indicate that cell- type- specific localization of a metal transporter is required to sustain metallation of an endomembrane cuproenzyme, providing a mechanism for exquisite spatial control of metalloenzyme activity. Moreover, because BLOC- 1 subunits are mutated in subtypes of the genetic disease Hermansky - Pudlak syndrome, these results also show that defects in copper transporter localization contribute to hypopigmentation, and hence perhaps other systemic defects, in Hermansky Pudlak syndrome.","[Setty, Subba Rao Gangi; Marks, Michael S.] Univ Penn, Dept Pathol & Lab Med, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Tenza, Daniele; Raposo, Graca] Ctr Rech, Inst Curie, F-75248 Paris, France; [Tenza, Daniele; Raposo, Graca] CNRS, UMR 144, F-75248 Paris, France; [Sviderskaya, Elena V.; Bennett, Dorothy C.] Univ London St Georges Hosp, Ctr Mol & Metab Signalling, Div Basic Med Sci, London SW17 0RE, England","Marks, MS (reprint author), Univ Penn, Dept Pathol & Lab Med, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",marksm@mail.med.upenn.edu,"Bennett, Dorothy/C-2418-2008; Sviderskaya, Elena/D-2419-2009","Bennett, Dorothy/0000-0002-3639-7527; Marks, Michael/0000-0001-7435-7262","National Institute of Health [R01 EY015625, R21 GM078474]; CNRS; Institut Curie and Fondation pour la Recherche Medicale; Wellcome Trust program [064583]; American Heart Association [0625437U]","We thank J.

Here we report the sequencing and analysis of the similar to 98 million base pair nuclear genome of the placozoan Trichoplax adhaerens. Whole- genome phylogenetic analysis suggests that placozoans belong to a 'eumetazoan' clade that includes cnidarians and bilaterians, with sponges as the earliest diverging animals. The compact genome shows conserved gene content, gene structure and synteny in relation to the human and other complex eumetazoan genomes. Despite the apparent cellular and organismal simplicity of Trichoplax, its genome encodes a rich array of transcription factor and signalling pathway genes that are typically associated with diverse cell types and developmental processes in eumetazoans, motivating further searches for cryptic cellular complexity and/ or as yet unobserved life history stages.","[Srivastava, Mansi; Begovic, Emina; Kawashima, Takeshi; Mitros, Therese; Carpenter, Meredith L.; Rokhsar, Daniel S.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Ctr Integrat Genom, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Srivastava, Mansi; Begovic, Emina; Kawashima, Takeshi; Mitros, Therese; Carpenter, Meredith L.; Rokhsar, Daniel S.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mol & Cell Biol, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Begovic, Emina; Chapman, Jarrod; Putnam, Nicholas H.; Hellsten, Uffe; Kuo, Alan; Salamov, Asaf; Shapiro, Harris; Grigoriev, Igor V.; Rokhsar, Daniel S.] Dept Energy Joint Genome Inst, Walnut Creek, CA 94598 USA; [Kawashima, Takeshi] Okinawa Inst Sci & Technol, Okinawa 9042234, Japan; [Signorovitch, Ana Y.; Moreno, Maria A.; Schierwater, Bernd; Dellaporta, Stephen L.] Yale Univ, Dept Mol Cellular & Dev Biol, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Signorovitch, Ana Y.; Buss, Leo W.] Yale Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Buss, Leo W.] Yale Univ, Dept Geol & Geophys, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Kamm, Kai; Schierwater, Bernd] Stiftung Tieraerztliche Hochsch Hannover, Div Ecol & Evolut, Inst Tierokol & Zellbiol, D-30559 Hannover, Germany; [Grimwood, Jane; Schmutz, Jeremy] Stanford Univ, Stanford Human Genome Ctr, Palo Alto, CA 94304 USA","Srivastava, M (reprint author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Ctr Integrat Genom, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",msrivast@berkeley.edu; dsrokhsar@yahoo.com,"Putnam, Nicholas/B-9968-2008; Carpenter, Meredith/B-4290-2011; Schmutz, Jeremy/N-3173-2013; Kawashima, Takeshi/M-4510-2015","Putnam, Nicholas/0000-0002-1315-782X; Schmutz, Jeremy/0000-0001-8062-9172; Carpenter, Meredith/0000-0002-9798-9374; Rokhsar, Daniel/0000-0002-8704-2224; Grigoriev, Igor/0000-0002-3136-8903","USA Department of Energy's Office of Science, Biological and Environmental Research Program; Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation; National Science Foundation; German Science Foundation","This work was performed under the auspices of the USA Department of Energy's Office of Science, Biological and Environmental Research Program and by the University of California, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and Los Alamos National Laboratory.

Here we show by in vivo fate mapping that brown, but not white, fat cells arise from precursors that express Myf5, a gene previously thought to be expressed only in the myogenic lineage. We also demonstrate that the transcriptional regulator PRDM16 ( PRD1- BF1- RIZ1 homologous domain containing 16) controls a bidirectional cell fate switch between skeletal myoblasts and brown fat cells. Loss of PRDM16 from brown fat precursors causes a loss of brown fat characteristics and promotes muscle differentiation. Conversely, ectopic expression of PRDM16 in myoblasts induces their differentiation into brown fat cells. PRDM16 stimulates brown adipogenesis by binding to PPAR-gamma (peroxisome-proliferator-activated receptor-gamma) and activating its transcriptional function. Finally, Prdm16-deficient brown fat displays an abnormal morphology, reduced thermogenic gene expression and elevated expression of muscle-specific genes. Taken together, these data indicate that PRDM16 specifies the brown fat lineage from a progenitor that expresses myoblast markers and is not involved in white adipogenesis.","[Seale, Patrick; Yang, Wenli; Kajimura, Shingo; Chin, Sherry; Devarakonda, Srikripa; Conroe, Heather M.; Spiegelman, Bruce M.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dana Farber Canc Inst, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Seale, Patrick; Yang, Wenli; Kajimura, Shingo; Chin, Sherry; Devarakonda, Srikripa; Conroe, Heather M.; Spiegelman, Bruce M.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Cell Biol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Bjork, Bryan; Beier, David R.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Brigham & Womens Hosp, Div Genet, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Kuang, Shihuan; Scime, Anthony; Rudnicki, Michael A.] Ottawa Hlth Res Inst, Program Mol Med, Sprott Ctr Stem Cell Res, Ottawa, ON K1H 8L6, Canada; [Erdjument-Bromage, Hediye; Tempst, Paul] Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, New York, NY 10021 USA","Spiegelman, BM (reprint author), Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dana Farber Canc Inst, 1 Jimmy Fund Way, Boston, MA 02115 USA.",bruce_spiegelman@dfci.harvard.edu,,"Kuang, Shihuan/0000-0001-9180-3180; Tempst, Paul/0000-0002-6680-3987",American Heart Association; Japan Society for the Promotion of Science; Susan Komen Breast Cancer Foundation; Picower Foundation; National Institutes of Health; National Institutes of Health/National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases,We thank V.

The filaments are dragged out from the centre of the galaxy by radio-emitting 'bubbles' rising buoyantly in the hot intracluster gas(4), before later falling back. They act as markers of the feedback process by which energy is transferred from the central massive black hole to the surrounding gas. The mechanism by which the filaments are stabilized against tidal shear and dissipation into the surrounding extremely hot (4 x 10(7) K) gas has been unclear. Here we report observations that resolve thread- like structures in the filaments. Some threads extend over 6 kpc, yet are only 70 pc wide.

Interactions between gaseous chemical species and ice cloud particles have been shown to be key factors in the loss of polar ozone observed in the Earth's stratosphere(6), and may significantly perturb the chemistry of the Earth's upper troposphere(7). Water-ice clouds are also commonly observed in the atmosphere of Mars(8-10) and it has been suggested previously that heterogeneous chemistry could have an important impact on the composition of the martian atmosphere(3-5,11). Here we use a state-of-the- art general circulation model together with new observations of the martian ozone layer(12-15) to show that model simulations to much improved quantitative agreement with observed martian ozone levels in comparison with model simulations based on gas-phase chemistry alone. Ozone is readily destroyed by hydrogen radicals and is therefore a sensitive tracer of the chemistry that regulates the atmosphere of Mars. Our results suggest that heterogeneous chemistry on ice clouds plays an important role in controlling the stability and composition of the martian atmosphere.","[Lefevre, Franck] Univ Paris 06, UPMC, Serv Aeron, F-75005 Paris, France; [Lefevre, Franck; Bertaux, Jean-Loup; Encrenaz, Therese; Forget, Francois; Lebonnois, Sebastien; Montmessin, Franck; Perrier, Severine] CNRS, INSU, F-75700 Paris, France; [Bertaux, Jean-Loup; Montmessin, Franck; Perrier, Severine] Univ Versailles St Quentin, Serv Aeron, F-91371 Verrieres Le Buisson, France; [Clancy, R.

This is true despite the Coulomb interactions an electron experiences from the host crystal lattice, lattice defects and the other similar to 10(22) cm(-3) electrons. An important extension to the theory accounts for the behaviour of doped semiconductors(1,2). Because little in the vast literature on materials contradicts Fermi liquid theory and its extensions, exceptions have attracted great attention, and they include the high- temperature superconductors(3), silicon- based field- effect transistors that host two- dimensional metals(4), and certain rare- earth compounds at the threshold of magnetism(5-8). The origin of the non- Fermi liquid behaviour in all of these systems remains controversial. Here we report that an entirely different and exceedingly simple class of materials - doped small- bandgap semiconductors near a metal - insulator transition - can also display a non- Fermi liquid state. Remarkably, a modest magnetic field functions as a switch which restores the ordinary disordered Fermi liquid. Our data suggest that we have found a physical realization of the only mathematically rigorous route to a non- Fermi liquid, namely the 'undercompensated Kondo effect', where there are too few mobile electrons to compensate for the spins of unpaired electrons localized on impurity atoms(9-12).","[Manyala, N.; DiTusa, J.

Experimental work(4) on gold particles supported on a titanium dioxide ( 110) single- crystal surface has established a striking size threshold effect associated with a metal- to- insulator transition, with gold particles catalytically active only if their diameters fall below similar to 3.5 nm. However, the remarkable catalytic behaviour might also in part arise from strong electronic interaction between the gold and the titanium dioxide support(2,3,5). In the case of industrially important selective oxidation reactions, explanation of the effectiveness of gold nanoparticle catalysts is complicated by the need for additives to drive the reaction(5,7,8), and/or the presence of strong support interactions and incomplete understanding of their possible catalytic role(1-3,5). Here we show that very small gold entities (similar to 1.4 nm) derived from 55- atom gold clusters and supported on inert materials are efficient and robust catalysts for the selective oxidation of styrene by dioxygen. We find a sharp size threshold in catalytic activity, in that particles with diameters of similar to 2 nm and above are completely inactive. Our observations suggest that catalytic activity arises from the altered electronic structure intrinsic to small gold nanoparticles, and that the use of 55- atom gold clusters may prove a viable route to the synthesis of robust gold catalysts suited to practical application.","[Turner, Mark; Golovko, Vladimir B.; Vaughan, Owain P.

The effective bulk modulus is significantly lowered if the pressure of the seismic wave drives a volume- reducing phase transformation(1,2). A comparison between the amount of time required by phase transitions to reach equilibrium and the sampling period thus becomes crucial in defining the softening and attenuation of compressional waves within such a two- phase zone(3). These phenomena are difficult to assess experimentally, however, because data at conditions appropriate to the Earth's deep interior are required. Here we present synchrotron- based experimental data that demonstrate softening of the bulk modulus within the two- phase loop of olivine - ringwoodite on a timescale of 100 s. If the amplitude of the pressure perturbation and the grain size are scaled to those expected in the Earth, the compressional-wave velocities within the discontinuities at 410, 520 and, possibly, 660 km are likely to be significantly lower than otherwise expected. The generalization of these observations to aluminium- controlled phase transitions raises the possibility of large velocity perturbations throughout the upper 1,000 km of the mantle.","[Li, Li; Weidner, Donald J.] SUNY Stony Brook, Inst Mineral Phys, Dept Geosci, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA","Li, L (reprint author), SUNY Stony Brook, Inst Mineral Phys, Dept Geosci, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA.",lilli@ic.sunysb.edu,,,"National Synchrotron Light Source; Consortium for Materials Properties in Earth Sciences; US Department of Energy [DE-AC02_ 98CH10886]; US National Science Foundation [EAR-0711365, EAR652887, EAR 01-35554]","We thank L.

This is especially clear in cases of self- destructive cooperation, where individuals die when helping others. If self- destructive cooperation is genetically encoded, these genes can only be maintained if they are expressed by just a fraction of their carriers, whereas the other fraction benefits from the public good. One mechanism that can mediate this differentiation into two phenotypically different sub- populations is phenotypic noise(1,2). Here we show that noisy expression of self- destructive cooperation can evolve if individuals that have a higher probability for self- destruction have, on average, access to larger public goods. This situation, which we refer to as assortment, can arise if the environment is spatially structured. These results provide a new perspective on the significance of phenotypic noise in bacterial pathogenesis: it might promote the formation of cooperative sub- populations that die while preparing the ground for a successful infection. We show experimentally that this model captures essential features of Salmonella typhimurium pathogenesis. We conclude that noisily expressed self- destructive cooperative actions can evolve under conditions of assortment, that self- destructive cooperation is a plausible biological function of phenotypic noise, and that self- destructive cooperation mediated by phenotypic noise could be important in bacterial pathogenesis.","[Ackermann, Martin; Freed, Nikki E.] ETH, Inst Integrat Biol, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland; [Stecher, Baerbel; Songhet, Pascal; Hardt, Wolf-Dietrich] ETH, Inst Microbiol, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland; [Doebeli, Michael] Univ British Columbia, Dept Zool, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada; [Doebeli, Michael] Univ British Columbia, Dept Math, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada","Ackermann, M (reprint author), ETH, Inst Integrat Biol, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland.",martin.ackermann@env.ethz.ch; hardt@micro.biol.ethz.ch; doebeli@zoology.ubc.ca,"Doebeli, Michael/D-5391-2012; Stecher, Barbel/A-2911-2015","Stecher, Barbel/0000-0002-7445-5193",Roche Research Foundation; Novartis Foundation; NSERC ( Canada); UBS foundation; ETH research foundation [TH-10 06-1]; Swiss National Science Foundation [310000-113623/1]; European Union [SavinMucoPath number 032296],"We are grateful to Markus Schlumberger, K.

Extrapolation of direct counts of stained microbial cells to the total volume of habitable marine subsurface sediments suggests that between 56 Pg ( ref. 1) and 303 Pg ( ref. 3) of cellular carbon could be stored in this largely unexplored habitat. From recent studies using various cultureindependent techniques, no clear picture has yet emerged as to whether Archaea or Bacteria are more abundant in this extensive ecosystem(4-7). Here we show that in subsurface sediments buried deeper than 1 m in a wide range of oceanographic settings at least 87% of intact polar membrane lipids, biomarkers for the presence of live cells(7,8), are attributable to archaeal membranes, suggesting that Archaea constitute a major fraction of the biomass. Results obtained from modified quantitative polymerase chain reaction and slot- blot hybridization protocols support the lipid- based evidence and indicate that these techniques have previously underestimated archaeal biomass. The lipid concentrations are proportional to those of total organic carbon. On the basis of this relationship, we derived an independent estimate of amounts of cellular carbon in the global marine subsurface biosphere. Our estimate of 90 Pg of cellular carbon is consistent, within an order of magnitude, with previous estimates, and underscores the importance of marine subsurface habitats for global biomass budgets.","[Lipp, Julius S.; Hinrichs, Kai-Uwe] Univ Bremen, Organ Geochem Grp, Dept Geosci, D-28334 Bremen, Germany; [Lipp, Julius S.; Hinrichs, Kai-Uwe] Univ Bremen, MARUM Ctr Marine Environm Sci, D-28334 Bremen, Germany; [Morono, Yuki; Inagaki, Fumio] Japan Agcy Marine Earth Sci & Technol, Geomicrobiol Grp, Kochi Inst Core Sample Res, Nanko Ku, Kochi 7838502, Japan","Hinrichs, KU (reprint author), Univ Bremen, Organ Geochem Grp, Dept Geosci, POB 330 440, D-28334 Bremen, Germany.",khinrichs@uni-bremen.de,"Hinrichs, Kai-Uwe/C-7675-2009","Hinrichs, Kai-Uwe/0000-0002-0739-9291","Integrated Ocean Drilling Program [301, 311]; Ocean Drilling Program [201, 204, 207]; US National Science Foundation; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft; IODP/ODP [Hi616-4]; JAMSTEC Multidisciplinary Research Promotion Award","Samples for this research were provided by the Integrated Ocean Drilling Program (IODP, expeditions 301 and 311), the Ocean Drilling Program (ODP, legs 201, 204 and 207; sponsored by the US National Science Foundation and participating countries under the Joint Oceanographic Institutions, Inc.), and cruises Sonne SO147, Kaiyo KY04-11, Professor Logatchev TTR15 and Chikyu Shakedown Expedition CK06-06.

Although a variety of measurements indicate the existence of such dependencies(1-3), their origin and importance for neural coding are poorly understood. Here we analyse the functional significance of correlated firing in a complete population of macaque parasol retinal ganglion cells using a model of multi-neuron spikeresponses(4,5). The model, with parameters fit directly to physiological data, simultaneously captures both the stimulus dependence and detailed spatio-temporal correlations in population responses, and provides two insights into the structure of the neural code. First, neural encoding at the population level is less noisy than one would expect from the variability of individual neurons: spike times are more precise, and can be predicted more accurately when the spiking of neighbouring neurons is taken into account. Second, correlations provide additional sensory information: optimal, model- based decoding that exploits the response correlation structure extracts 20% more information about the visual scene than decoding under the assumption of independence, and preserves 40% more visual information than optimal linear decoding(6). This model- based approach reveals the role of correlated activity in the retinal coding of visual stimuli, and provides a general framework for understanding the importance of correlated activity in populations of neurons.","[Pillow, Jonathan W.] UCL, Gatsby Computat Neurosci Unit, London WC1N 3AR, England; [Shlens, Jonathon; Chichilnisky, E.

Two functionally different types of fat are present in mammals: white adipose tissue, the primary site of triglyceride storage, and brown adipose tissue, which is specialized in energy expenditure and can counteract obesity61. Factors that specify the developmental fate and function of white and brown adipose tissue remain poorly understood(2,3). Here we demonstrate that whereas some members of the family of bone morphogenetic proteins ( BMPs) support white adipocyte differentiation, BMP7 singularly promotes differentiation of brown preadipocytes even in the absence of the normally required hormonal induction cocktail. BMP7 activates a full program of brown adipogenesis including induction of early regulators of brown fat fate PRDM16 ( PR- domain- containing 16; ref. 4) and PGC-1 alpha ( peroxisome proliferator- activated receptor-gamma ( PPAR gamma) coactivator-1 alpha; ref. 5), increased expression of the brown- fat- defining marker uncoupling protein 1 ( UCP1) and adipogenic transcription factors PPAR gamma and CCAAT/ enhancer- binding proteins ( C/ EBPs), and induction of mitochondrial biogenesis via p38 mitogen- activated protein ( MAP) kinase-( also known as Mapk14) and PGC- 1- dependent pathways. Moreover, BMP7 triggers commitment of mesenchymal progenitor cells to a brown adipocyte lineage, and implantation of these cells into nude mice results in development of adipose tissue containing mostly brown adipocytes. Bmp7 knockout embryos show a marked paucity of brown fat and an almost complete absence of UCP1. Adenoviral-ediated expression of BMP7 in mice results in a significant increase in brown, but not white, fat mass and leads to an increase in energy expenditure and a reduction in weight gain. These data reveal an important role of BMP7 in promoting brown adipocyte differentiation and thermogenesis in vivo and in vitro, and provide a potential new therapeutic approach for the treatment of obesity.","[Tseng, Yu-Hua; Schulz, Tim J.; Huang, Tian Lian; Winnay, Jonathon N.; Taniguchi, Cullen M.; Tran, Thien T.; Suzuki, Ryo; Espinoza, Daniel O.; Yamamoto, Yuji; Kahn, C.

EspFU potently activates the host WASP ( Wiskott - Aldrich syndrome protein) family of actin- nucleating factors, which are normally activated by the GTPase CDC42, among other signalling molecules. Apart from its amino- terminal type III secretion signal, EspFU consists of five- and- a- half 47- amino- acid repeats. Here we show that a 17- residue motif within this EspFU repeat is sufficient for interaction with N- WASP ( also known as WASL). Unlike most pathogen proteins that interface with the cytoskeletal machinery, this motif does not mimic natural upstream activators: instead of mimicking an activated state of CDC42, EspFU mimics an auto-nhibitory element found within N- WASP. Thus, EspFU activates N- WASP by competitively disrupting the autoinhibited state. By mimicking an internal regulatory element and not the natural activator, EspFU selectively activates only a precise subset of CDC42- activated processes. Although one repeat is able to stimulate actin polymerization, we show that multiple- repeat fragments have notably increased potency. The activities of these EspFU fragments correlate with their ability to coordinate activation of at least two N- WASP proteins. Thus, this pathogen has used a simple autoinhibitory fragment as a component to build a highly effective actin polymerization machine.","[Sallee, Nathan A.; Dueber, John E.; Mullins, R.

EspFU controls actin by activating members of the Wiskott - Aldrich syndrome protein ( WASP) family(1-5). Here we show that EspFU binds to the autoinhibitory GTPase binding domain ( GBD) in WASP proteins and displaces it from the activity- bearing VCA domain ( for verprolin homology, central hydrophobic and acidic regions). This interaction potently activates WASP and neural ( N)- WASP in vitro and induces localized actin assembly in cells. In the solution structure of the GBD - EspFU complex, EspFU forms an amphipathic helix that binds the GBD, mimicking interactions of the VCA domain in autoinhibited WASP. Thus, EspFU activates WASP by competing directly for the VCA binding site on the GBD. This mechanism is distinct from that used by the eukaryotic activators Cdc42 and SH2 domains, which globally destabilize the GBD fold to release the VCA(6-8). Such diversity of mechanism in WASP proteins is distinct from other multimodular systems, and may result from the intrinsically unstructured nature of the isolated GBD and VCA elements. The structural incompatibility of the GBD complexes with EspFU and Cdc42/SH2, plus high- affinity EspFU binding, enable EHEC to hijack the eukaryotic cytoskeletal machinery effectively.","[Cheng, Hui-Chun; Rosen, Michael K.] Univ Texas SW Med Ctr Dallas, Dept Biochem, Dallas, TX 75390 USA; [Cheng, Hui-Chun; Rosen, Michael K.] Univ Texas SW Med Ctr Dallas, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Dallas, TX 75390 USA; [Skehan, Brian M.; Campellone, Kenneth G.; Leong, John M.] Univ Massachusetts, Sch Med, Dept Mol Genet & Microbiol, Worcester, MA 01655 USA","Rosen, MK (reprint author), Univ Texas SW Med Ctr Dallas, Dept Biochem, Dallas, TX 75390 USA.",michael.rosen@utsouthwestern.edu,,,"National Institute of Health [NIH-R01-GM56322, NIH-R01-AI46454]; Welch Foundation [I-1544]; Chilton Foundation Fellowship","We thank T.

One theoretical model proposes that geomagnetic fields are perceived by chemical reactions involving specialized photoreceptors(3). However, the specific photoreceptor involved in such magnetoreception has not been demonstrated conclusively in any animal. Here we show that the ultraviolet-A/blue-light photoreceptor cryptochrome ( Cry) is necessary for light- dependent magnetosensitive responses in Drosophila melanogaster. In a binary- choice behavioural assay for magnetosensitivity, wild- type flies show significant naive and trained responses to a magnetic field under full- spectrum light (similar to 300-700 nm) but do not respond to the field when wavelengths in the Cry- sensitive, ultraviolet- A/ blue- light part of the spectrum (<420 nm) are blocked. Notably, Cry- deficient cry(0) and cry(b) flies do not show either naive or trained responses to a magnetic field under full- spectrum light.

We investigated the genetic basis of a classic phenotypic dimorphism in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. Males from many natural isolates deposit a copulatory plug after mating, whereas males from other natural isolates - including the standard wild- type strain ( N2 Bristol) that is used in most research laboratories - do not deposit plugs(1). The copulatory plug is a gelatinous mass that covers the hermaphrodite vulva, and its deposition decreases the mating success of subsequent males(2). We show that the plugging polymorphism results from the insertion of a retrotransposon into an exon of a novel mucin- like gene, plg-1, whose product is a major structural component of the copulatory plug. The gene is expressed in a subset of secretory cells of the male somatic gonad, and its loss has no evident effects beyond the loss of male mate- guarding. Although C. elegans descends from an obligate- outcrossing, male - female ancestor(3,4), it occurs primarily as self- fertilizing hermaphrodites(5-7). The reduced selection on male - male competition associated with the origin of hermaphroditism may have permitted the global spread of a loss-of-function mutation with restricted pleiotropy.","[Palopoli, Michael F.; TinMaung, Aye; Ramsay, Camden; Curwen, Stephen; Aduna, Andrea; Laurita, Jason] Bowdoin Coll, Dept Biol, Brunswick, ME 04011 USA; [Rockman, Matthew V.; Kruglyak, Leonid] Princeton Univ, Carl Icahn Lab, Lewis Sigler Inst Integrat Genom, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Rockman, Matthew V.; Kruglyak, Leonid] Princeton Univ, Carl Icahn Lab, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA","Palopoli, MF (reprint author), Bowdoin Coll, Dept Biol, 6500 Coll Stn, Brunswick, ME 04011 USA.",mpalopol@bowdoin.edu,,,"NIH [P20 RR-016463, R01 HG004321, P50 GM071508]; INBRE Program of the National Center for Research Resources; NSF [0110994]; Howard Hughes Medical Institute under the Undergraduate Science Education Program; James S.

Ghrelin-induced feeding behaviour is controlled by arcuate nucleus neurons that co-express neuropeptide Y and agouti-related protein (NPY/AgRP neurons). However, the intracellular mechanisms triggered by ghrelin to alter NPY/AgRP neuronal activity are poorly understood. Here we show that ghrelin initiates robust changes in hypothalamic mitochondrial respiration in mice that are dependent on uncoupling protein 2 (UCP2). Activation of this mitochondrial mechanism is critical for ghrelin-induced mitochondrial proliferation and electric activation of NPY/AgRP neurons, for ghrelin-triggered synaptic plasticity of pro-opiomelanocortin-expressing neurons, and for ghrelin-induced food intake. The UCP2-dependent action of ghrelin on NPY/AgRP neurons is driven by a hypothalamic fatty acid oxidation pathway involving AMPK, CPT1 and free radicals that are scavenged by UCP2. These results reveal a signalling modality connecting mitochondria-mediated effects of G-protein-coupled receptors on neuronal function and associated behaviour.","[Andrews, Zane B.; Horvath, Tamas L.] Yale Univ, Sch Med, Comparat Med Sect, Howard Hughes Med Inst, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Andrews, Zane B.; Liu, Zhong-Wu; Walllingford, Nicholas; Erion, Derek M.; Borok, Erzsebet; Shanabrough, Marya; Coppola, Anna; Gao, Xiao-Bing; Horvath, Tamas L.; Diano, Sabrina] Yale Univ, Sch Med, Dept Obstet Gynecol & Reprod Sci, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Cline, Gary; Shulman, Gerald I.] Yale Univ, Sch Med, Dept Internal Med, Howard Hughes Med Inst, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Horvath, Tamas L.; Diano, Sabrina] Yale Univ, Sch Med, Dept Neurobiol, Howard Hughes Med Inst, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Liu, Zhong-Wu] Yunyang Med Coll, Dept Neurobiol, Shiyan 442000, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Friedman, Jeffery M.] Rockefeller Univ, Genet Mol Lab, Howard Hughes Med Inst, New York, NY 10021 USA; [Tschop, Matthias H.] Univ Cincinnati, Dept Psychiat, Cincinnati, OH 45237 USA","Horvath, TL (reprint author), Yale Univ, Sch Med, Comparat Med Sect, Howard Hughes Med Inst, 333 Cedar St, New Haven, CT 06520 USA.",tamas.horvath@yale.edu; sabrina.diano@yale.edu,"Liu, Zhong-Wu/C-2794-2011; Gao, Xiao-Bing/C-3121-2011; Tschoep, Matthias/I-5443-2014","Tschoep, Matthias/0000-0002-4744-371X; Andrews, Zane B./0000-0002-9097-7944",Howard Hughes Medical Institute; NIA NIH HHS [R01 AG022880]; NIDDK NIH HHS [R01 DK040936],,,39,399,417,1,48,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,14-Aug,2008,454,7206,,,,,846,851,,10.1038/nature07181,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,336XH,WOS:000258398600027,18668043,No,Y,N,11/20/17

Here we report that most near-Earth asteroids (including the potentially hazardous subset) have spectral properties quantitatively similar to the class of meteorites known as LL chondrites. The prominent Flora family in the inner part of the asteroid belt shares the same spectral properties, suggesting that it is a dominant source of near-Earth asteroids. The observed similarity of near-Earth asteroids to LL chondrites is, however, surprising, as this meteorite class is relatively rare (similar to 8 per cent of all meteorite falls).

Quantum physics predicts an entirely different kind of cause for some correlations, named entanglement. This reveals itself in correlations that violate Bell inequalities (implying that they cannot be described by common causes) between space-like separated events (implying that they cannot be described by classical communication). Many Bell tests have been performed(1), and loopholes related to locality(2-4) and detection(5,6) have been closed in several independent experiments. It is still possible that a first event could influence a second, but the speed of this hypothetical influence (Einstein's 'spooky action at a distance') would need to be defined in some universal privileged reference frame and be greater than the speed of light. Here we put stringent experimental bounds on the speed of all such hypothetical influences. We performed a Bell test over more than 24 hours between two villages separated by 18 km and approximately east-west oriented, with the source located precisely in the middle. We continuously observed two-photon interferences well above the Bell inequality threshold. Taking advantage of the Earth's rotation, the configuration of our experiment allowed us to determine, for any hypothetically privileged frame, a lower bound for the speed of the influence. For example, if such a privileged reference frame exists and is such that the Earth's speed in this frame is less than 10(-3) times that of the speed of light, then the speed of the influence would have to exceed that of light by at least four orders of magnitude.","[Salart, Daniel; Baas, Augustin; Branciard, Cyril; Gisin, Nicolas; Zbinden, Hugo] Univ Geneva, Appl Phys Grp, CH-1211 Geneva 4, Switzerland","Salart, D (reprint author), Univ Geneva, Appl Phys Grp, 20 Rue Ecole Med, CH-1211 Geneva 4, Switzerland.",daniel.salart@physics.unige.ch,"Branciard, Cyril/A-6964-2012","Branciard, Cyril/0000-0001-9460-825X",,,,22,95,101,3,15,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,14-Aug,2008,454,7206,,,,,861,864,,10.1038/nature07121,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,336XH,WOS:000258398600030,18704081,No,,,11/20/17

However, some fullerene derivatives or unusual fullerene species might only be accessible through rational and controlled synthesis methods. Recently, such an approach has been used(1) to produce isolable amounts of the fullerene C(60) from commercially available starting materials. But the overall process required 11 steps to generate a suitable polycyclic aromatic precursor molecule, which was then dehydrogenated in the gas phase with a yield of only about one per cent. Here we report the formation of C(60) and the triazafullerene C(57)N(3) from aromatic precursors using a highly efficient surface-catalysed cyclodehydrogenation process. We find that after deposition onto a platinum (111) surface and heating to 750 K, the precursors are transformed into the corresponding fullerene and triazafullerene molecules with about 100 per cent yield. We expect that this approach will allow the production of a range of other fullerenes and heterofullerenes(2,3), once suitable precursors are available. Also, if the process is carried out in an atmosphere containing guest species, it might even allow the encapsulation of atoms or small molecules to form endohedral fullerenes(4,5).","[Otero, Gonzalo; Sanchez-Sanchez, Carlos; Caillard, Renaud; Lopez, Maria F.; Palomares, F.

These glaciations, during which the Northern Hemisphere ice sheets successively expanded and retreated, are superimposed on this long-term climate trend, and have been linked to variations in the Earth's orbital parameters(4). One intriguing problem associated with orbitally driven glacial cycles is the transition from 41,000-year to 100,000-year climatic cycles that occurred without an apparent change in insolation forcing(5). Several hypotheses have been proposed to explain the transition, both including and excluding ice-sheet dynamics(6-10). Difficulties in finding a conclusive answer to this palaeoclimatic problem are related to the lack of sufficiently long records of ice-sheet volume or sea level. Here we use a comprehensive ice-sheet model and a simple ocean-temperature model(11) to extract three-million-year mutually consistent records of surface air temperature, ice volume and sea level from marine benthic oxygen isotopes(12). Although these records and their relative phasings are subject to considerable uncertainty owing to limited availability of palaeoclimate constraints, the results suggest that the gradual emergence of the 100,000-year cycles can be attributed to the increased ability of the merged North American ice sheets to survive insolation maxima and reach continental-scale size. The oversized, wet-based ice sheet probably responded to the subsequent insolation maximum by rapid thinning through increased basal-sliding(13,14), thereby initiating a glacial termination. Based on our assessment of the temporal changes in air temperature and ice volume during individual glacials, we demonstrate the importance of ice dynamics and ice-climate interactions in establishing the 100,000-year glacial cycles, with enhanced North American ice-sheet growth and the subsequent merging of the ice sheets being key elements.","[Bintanja, R.] Royal Netherlands Meteorol Inst, KNMI, NL-3732 GK De Bilt, Netherlands; [van de Wal, R.

The most direct evidence for a solid inner core would be the observation of shear-mode body waves that traverse it, but these phases are extremely difficult to observe. Two reported observations in short-period data(4,5) have proved controversial(6). Arguably more successful have been studies of longer-period data(6,7), but such averaging limits the usefulness of the observations to reported sightings. We present two observations of an inner-core shear-wave phase at higher frequencies in stacked data from the Japanese High-Sensitivity Array, Hi-Net(8). From an analysis of timing, amplitude and waveform of the 'PKJKP' phase we derive constraints on inner-core compressional-wave velocity and shear attenuation at about 0.3 Hz which differ from standard isotropic core models(9). We can explain waveform features and can partially reconcile the otherwise large differences between core wavespeed and attenuation models that our observations apparently suggest if we invoke shear-wave anisotropy in the inner core. A simple model of an inner core composed of hexagonal close-packed iron with its c axis aligned perpendicular to the rotation axis(10) yields anisotropy that is compatible with both the shear-wave anisotropy that we observe and the well-established 3 per cent compressional-wave anisotropy.","[Wookey, James; Helffrich, George] Univ Bristol, Dept Earth Sci, Bristol BS8 1RJ, Avon, England","Wookey, J (reprint author), Univ Bristol, Dept Earth Sci, Wills Mem Bldg,Queens Rd, Bristol BS8 1RJ, Avon, England.",j.wookey@bristol.ac.uk,"Wookey, James/G-6113-2011","Helffrich, George/0000-0002-7363-4552",,,,34,27,27,1,13,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,14-Aug,2008,454,7206,,,,,873,U24,,10.1038/nature07131,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,336XH,WOS:000258398600033,18704084,No,,,11/20/17

This is true for cholera, a pandemic bacterial disease, where estimates of the ratio of asymptomatic to symptomatic infections have ranged from 3 to 100 (refs 1-5). In the absence of direct evidence, understanding of fundamental aspects of cholera transmission, immunology and control has been based on assumptions about this ratio and about the immunological consequences of inapparent infections. Here we show that a model incorporating high asymptomatic ratio and rapidly waning immunity, with infection both from human and environmental sources, explains 50 yr of mortality data from 26 districts of Bengal, the pathogen's endemic home. We find that the asymptomatic ratio in cholera is far higher than had been previously supposed and that the immunity derived from mild infections wanes much more rapidly than earlier analyses have indicated. We find, too, that the environmental reservoir(5,6) (free-living pathogen) is directly responsible for relatively few infections but that it may be critical to the disease's endemicity. Our results demonstrate that inapparent infections can hold the key to interpreting the patterns of disease outbreaks. New statistical methods(7), which allow rigorous maximum likelihood inference based on dynamical models incorporating multiple sources and outcomes of infection, seasonality, process noise, hidden variables and measurement error, make it possible to test more precise hypotheses and obtain unexpected results. Our experience suggests that the confrontation of time-series data with mechanistic models is likely to revise our understanding of the ecology of many infectious diseases.","[King, Aaron A.; Pascual, Mercedes] Univ Michigan, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [King, Aaron A.] Univ Michigan, Dept Math, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Ionides, Edward L.] Univ Michigan, Dept Stat, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Pascual, Mercedes] Santa Fe Inst, Santa Fe, NM 87501 USA; [Bouma, Menno J.] Univ London London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, Dept Infect & Trop Dis, London WC1E 7HT, England","King, AA (reprint author), Univ Michigan, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",kingaa@umich.edu,"King, Aaron/B-8092-2012","King, Aaron/0000-0001-6159-3207",,,,36,180,183,2,53,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,14-Aug,2008,454,7206,,,,,877,U29,,10.1038/nature07084,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,336XH,WOS:000258398600034,18704085,No,,,11/20/17

A prominent reflection of different brain states in the mammalian central nervous system is the presence of distinct patterns of cortical synchrony, as revealed by extracellular recordings of the electroencephalogram, local field potential and action potentials. Such temporal correlations of cortical activity are thought to be fundamental mechanisms of neuronal computation(3-11). However, it is unknown how cortical synchrony is reflected in the intracellular membrane potential (V(m)) dynamics of behaving animals. Here we show, using dual whole-cell recordings from layer 2/3 primary somatosensory barrel cortex in behaving mice, that the Vm of nearby neurons is highly correlated during quiet wakefulness. However, when the mouse is whisking, an internally generated state change reduces the Vm correlation, resulting in a desynchronized local field potential and electroencephalogram. Action potential activity was sparse during both quiet wakefulness and active whisking. Single action potentials were driven by a large, brief and specific excitatory input that was not present in the Vm of neighbouring cells. Action potential initiation occurs with a higher signal-to-noise ratio during active whisking than during quiet periods. Therefore, we show that an internal brain state dynamically regulates cortical membrane potential synchrony during behaviour and defines different modes of cortical processing.","[Poulet, James F.

Additional mechanisms, such as directed transport(2) or coupled inhibitors(3,4), have been proposed to be required for reinforcing a unique axis of polarity. Here we analyse a simple model of positive feedback, with strong analogy to the 'stepping stone' model of population genetics(5), in which a single species of diffusible, membrane-bound signalling molecules can self-recruit from a cytoplasmic pool. We identify an intrinsic stochastic mechanism through which positive feedback alone is sufficient to account for the spontaneous establishment of a single site of polarity. We find that the polarization frequency has an inverse dependence on the number of signalling molecules: the frequency of polarization decreases as the number of molecules becomes large. Experimental observation of polarizing Cdc42 in budding yeast is consistent with this prediction. Our work suggests that positive feedback can work alone or with additional mechanisms to create robust cell polarity.","[Altschuler, Steven J.; Wang, Yanqin; Wu, Lani F.] Univ Texas SW Med Ctr Dallas, Green Ctr Syst Biol, Dept Pharmacol, Dallas, TX 75390 USA; [Altschuler, Steven J.; Wang, Yanqin; Wu, Lani F.] Univ Texas SW Med Ctr Dallas, Simmons Canc Ctr, Dallas, TX 75390 USA; [Angenent, Sigurd B.] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Math, Madison, WI 53706 USA","Altschuler, SJ (reprint author), Univ Texas SW Med Ctr Dallas, Green Ctr Syst Biol, Dept Pharmacol, Dallas, TX 75390 USA.",steven.altschuler@utsouthwestern.edu; lani.wu@utsouthwestern.edu,,,"NIGMS NIH HHS [R01 GM071794, R01 GM071794-05]",,,30,120,120,1,16,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,14-Aug,2008,454,7206,,,,,886,U41,,10.1038/nature07119,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,336XH,WOS:000258398600036,18704086,No,,,11/20/17

Identifying the host molecules that participate in each step of virus replication could provide valuable new targets for antiviral therapy, but this goal may take several decades to achieve with conventional forward genetic screening methods and mammalian cell cultures. Here we describe a novel genome-wide RNA interference (RNAi) screen in Drosophila 1 that can be used to identify host genes important for influenza virus replication. After modifying influenza virus to allow infection of Drosophila cells and detection of influenza virus gene expression, we tested an RNAi library against 13,071 genes (90% of the Drosophila genome), identifying over 100 for which suppression in Drosophila cells significantly inhibited or stimulated reporter gene (Renilla luciferase) expression from an influenza-virus-derived vector. The relevance of these findings to influenza virus infection of mammalian cells is illustrated for a subset of the Drosophila genes identified; that is, for three implicated Drosophila genes, the corresponding human homologues ATP6V0D1, COX6A1 and NXF1 are shown to have key functions in the replication of H5N1 and H1N1 influenza A viruses, but not vesicular stomatitis virus or vaccinia virus, in human HEK 293 cells. Thus, we have demonstrated the feasibility of using genome-wide RNAi screens in Drosophila to identify previously unrecognized host proteins that are required for influenza virus replication. This could accelerate the development of new classes of antiviral drugs for chemoprophylaxis and treatment, which are urgently needed given the obstacles to rapid development of an effective vaccine against pandemic influenza and the probable emergence of strains resistant to available drugs.","[Sakurai, Akira; Watanabe, Tokiko; Kawaoka, Yoshihiro] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Pathobiol Sci, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Hao, Linhui; Sorensen, Ericka; Ahlquist, Paul] Univ Wisconsin, Inst Mol Virol, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Hao, Linhui; Ahlquist, Paul] Univ Wisconsin, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Newton, Michael A.] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Stat, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Newton, Michael A.] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Biostat, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Newton, Michael A.] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Med Informat, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Nidom, Chairul A.] Airlangga Univ, Fac Vet Med, Surabaya 60115, Indonesia; [Nidom, Chairul A.] Airlangga Univ, Collaborating Res Ctr Emerging & Reemerging Infec, Trop Dis Ctr, Surabaya 60115, Indonesia; [Kawaoka, Yoshihiro] Univ Tokyo, Div Virol, Dept Microbiol & Immunol, Tokyo 1088639, Japan; [Kawaoka, Yoshihiro] Univ Tokyo, Int Res Ctr Infect Dis, Inst Med Sci, Tokyo 1088639, Japan; [Kawaoka, Yoshihiro] Kobe Univ, Grad Sch Med, Div Zoonosis, Dept Microbiol & Infect Dis, Kobe, Hyogo 6500017, Japan","Kawaoka, Y (reprint author), Univ Wisconsin, Dept Pathobiol Sci, Madison, WI 53706 USA.",ahlqust@wisc.edu; kawaokay@svm.vetmed.wisc.edu,,,"Howard Hughes Medical Institute; NIAID NIH HHS [R01 AI044386, R01 AI044386-10, R01 AI047446, R01 AI047446-09, R01 AI069274, R01 AI069274-03]; NIGMS NIH HHS [GM35072, R01 GM035072, R01 GM035072-23, R37 GM035072]",,,28,261,271,1,30,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,14-Aug,2008,454,7206,,,,,890,U46,,10.1038/nature07151,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,336XH,WOS:000258398600037,18615016,No,,,11/20/17

In some individuals the microbe is cleared, but in others it establishes a chronic infection, and the factors that tip this balance are often unknown. In a widely used model of chronic viral infection, C57BL/6 mice clear the Armstrong strain of lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV), but the clone 13 strain persists(1,2). Here we show that the Armstrong strain induces a profound lymphopenia at days 1-3 after infection, but the clone 13 strain does not. If we transiently augment lymphopenia by treating the clone-13-infected mice with the drug FTY720 at days 0-2 after infection, the mice successfully clear the infection by day 30. Clearance does not occur when CD4 T cells are absent at the time of treatment, indicating that the drug is not exerting direct antiviral effects. Notably, FTY720 treatment of an already established persistent infection also leads to viral clearance. In both models, FTY720 treatment preserves or augments LCMV-specific CD4 and CD8 T-cell responses, a result that is counter-intuitive because FTY720 is generally regarded as a new immunosuppressive agent(3). Because FTY720 targets host pathways that are completely evolutionarily conserved, our results may be translatable into new immunotherapies for the treatment of chronic microbial infections in humans.","[Premenko-Lanier, Mary; Moseley, Nelson B.; Romagnoli, Pablo A.; Altman, John D.] Emory Univ, Emory Vaccine Ctr, Atlanta, GA 30329 USA; [Premenko-Lanier, Mary; Moseley, Nelson B.; Romagnoli, Pablo A.; Altman, John D.] Emory Univ, Dept Microbiol & Immunol, Atlanta, GA 30329 USA; [Premenko-Lanier, Mary; Moseley, Nelson B.; Romagnoli, Pablo A.; Altman, John D.] Emory Univ, Yerkes Natl Primate Res Ctr, Atlanta, GA 30329 USA; [Premenko-Lanier, Mary; Moseley, Nelson B.; Romagnoli, Pablo A.; Altman, John D.] Emory Univ, Sch Med, Atlanta, GA 30329 USA; [Pruett, Sarah T.] Yerkes Natl Primate Res Ctr, Div Psychobiol, Atlanta, GA 30329 USA","Altman, JD (reprint author), Emory Univ, Emory Vaccine Ctr, 954 Gatewood Rd, Atlanta, GA 30329 USA.",mflanie@emory.edu; jaltman@rmy.emory.edu,"Pruett, Sarah/C-7433-2009",,"NIAID NIH HHS [5F32AI062002, AI042373]",,,25,20,20,0,9,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,14-Aug,2008,454,7206,,,,,894,U52,,10.1038/nature07199,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,336XH,WOS:000258398600038,18704087,No,,,11/20/17

In bacteria, control of a metabolite gene is mediated by the self-cleaving activity of a ribozyme embedded in its 59 UTR(1). This discovery has raised the question of whether gene-regulating ribozymes also exist in eukaryotic mRNAs. Here we show that highly active hammerhead ribozymes(2,3) are present in the 3 ' UTRs of rodent C-type lectin type II (Clec2) genes(4-7). Using a hammerhead RNA motif search with relaxed delimitation of the non-conserved regions, we detected ribozyme sequences in which the invariant regions, in contrast to the previously identified continuous hammerheads(8-10), occur as two fragments separated by hundreds of nucleotides. Notably, a fragment pair can assemble to form an active hammerhead ribozyme structure between the translation termination and the polyadenylation signals within the 3 ' UTR. We demonstrate that this hammerhead structure can self-cleave both in vitro and in vivo, and is able to reduce protein expression in mouse cells. These results indicate that an unrecognized mechanism of post-transcriptional gene regulation involving association of discontinuous ribozyme sequences within an mRNA may be modulating the expression of several CLEC2 proteins that function in bone remodelling and the immune response of several mammals.","[Martick, Monika; Horan, Lucas H.; Noller, Harry F.; Scott, William G.] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Ctr Mol Biol RNA, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA","Martick, M (reprint author), Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Ctr Mol Biol RNA, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA.",mmartick@yahoo.com,,,"NIAID NIH HHS [R01 AI043393-09, R01 AI043393]; NIGMS NIH HHS [R01 GM087721]; PHS HHS [R01043393]",,,29,97,100,0,14,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,14-Aug,2008,454,7206,,,,,899,U57,,10.1038/nature07117,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,336XH,WOS:000258398600039,18615019,No,,,11/20/17

Like fatty acid synthases (FAS), these enzymes are organized in modular assembly lines in which each module, made of conserved domains, incorporates a given monomer unit into the growing chain. Knowledge about domain or module interactions may enable reengineering of this assembly line enzymatic organization and open avenues for the design of new bioactive compounds with improved therapeutic properties. So far, little structural information has been available on how the domains interact and communicate. This may be because of inherent interdomain mobility hindering crystallization, or because crystallized molecules may not represent the active domain orientations(2). In solution, the large size and internal dynamics of multidomain fragments (> 35 kilodaltons) make structure determination by nuclear magnetic resonance a challenge and require advanced technologies. Here we present the solution structure of the apo-thiolation-thioesterase (T-TE) di-domain fragment of the Escherichia coli enterobactin synthetase EntF NRPS subunit. In the holoenzyme, the T domain carries the growing chain tethered to a 4 '-phosphopantetheine whereas the TE domain catalyses hydrolysis and cyclization of the iron chelator enterobactin. The T-TE di-domain forms a compact but dynamic structure with a well-defined domain interface; the two active sites are at a suitable distance for substrate transfer from T to TE. We observe extensive interdomain and intradomain motions forwell-defined regions and show that these are modulated by interactions with proteins that participate in the biosynthesis. The T-TE interaction described here provides a model for NRPS, PKS and FAS function in general as T-TE-like di-domains typically catalyse the last step in numerous assembly-line chain-termination machineries.","[Frueh, Dominique P.; Arthanari, Haribabu; Koglin, Alexander; Vosburg, David A.; Bennett, Andrew E.; Walsh, Christopher T.; Wagner, Gerhard] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Biol Chem & Mol Pharmacol, Boston, MA 02115 USA","Wagner, G (reprint author), Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Biol Chem & Mol Pharmacol, Boston, MA 02115 USA.",dominique_frueh@hms.harvard.edu; christopher_walsh@hms.harvard.edu; gerhard_wagner@hms.harvard.edu,"Frueh, Dominique/A-6462-2008","Frueh, Dominique/0000-0003-4605-3776","NIBIB NIH HHS [EB 002026, P41 EB002026, P41 EB002026-28, P41 EB002026-29, P41 EB002026-30, P41 EB002026-31, P41 EB002026-32, P41 EB002026-33]; NIGMS NIH HHS [P41 GM066360-04, GM066360, GM47467, P01 GM047467, P01 GM047467-11, P01 GM047467-110009, P01 GM047467-12, P01 GM047467-13, P01 GM047467-14, P01 GM047467-15, P01 GM047467-16, P01 GM047467-160012, P01 GM047467-17, P01 GM047467-170012, P41 GM066360, P41 GM066360-01, P41 GM066360-02, P41 GM066360-03, P41 GM066360-05]",,,46,99,99,0,35,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,14-Aug,2008,454,7206,,,,,903,U62,,10.1038/nature07162,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,336XH,WOS:000258398600040,18704088,No,,,11/20/17

Type I thioesterases (TEI) catalyse the release step from the assembly line(3) of the final product where it is transported from one reaction centre to the next as a thioester linked to a 4 '-phosphopantetheine (4 '-PP) cofactor that is covalently attached to thiolation (T) domains(4-9). The second enzyme involved in the synthesis of these secondary metabolites, the type II thioesterase (TEII), is a crucial repair enzyme for the regeneration of functional 4 '-PP cofactors of holo-T domains of NRPS and PKS systems(10-12). Mispriming of 4 '-PP cofactors by acetyl- and short-chain acyl-residues interrupts the biosynthetic system. This repair reaction is very important, because roughly 80% of CoA, the precursor of the 4 '-PP cofactor, is acetylated in bacteria(13). Here we report the three-dimensional structure of a type II thioesterase from Bacillus subtilis free and in complex with a T domain. Comparison with structures of TEI enzymes(3,14) shows the basis for substrate selectivity and the different modes of interaction of TEII and TEI enzymes with T domains. Furthermore, we show that the TEII enzyme exists in several conformations of which only one is selected on interaction with its native substrate, a modified holo-T domain.","[Koglin, Alexander; Loehr, Frank; Bernhard, Frank; Rogov, Vladimir V.; Guentert, Peter; Doetsch, Volker] Univ Frankfurt, Inst Biophys Chem, D-60438 Frankfurt, Germany; [Koglin, Alexander; Loehr, Frank; Bernhard, Frank; Rogov, Vladimir V.; Guentert, Peter; Doetsch, Volker] Univ Frankfurt, Ctr Biomol Magnet Resonance & Cluster Excellence, D-60438 Frankfurt, Germany; [Koglin, Alexander; Frueh, Dominique P.; Strieter, Eric R.; Wagner, Gerhard; Walsh, Christopher T.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Biol Chem & Mol Pharmacol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Rogov, Vladimir V.] Russian Acad Sci, Inst Prot Res, Pushchino 142290, Russia; [Mofid, Mohammad R.; Marahiel, Mohamed A.] Univ Marburg, Dept Chem Biochem, D-35032 Marburg, Germany; [Guentert, Peter] Frankfurt Inst Adv Studies, D-60438 Frankfurt, Germany","Dotsch, V (reprint author), Univ Frankfurt, Inst Biophys Chem, D-60438 Frankfurt, Germany.",Christopher_Walsh@hms.harvard.edu; Marahiel@chemie.uni-marburg.de; VDoetsch@em.uni-frankfurt.de,"Frueh, Dominique/A-6462-2008; Doetsch, Volker/D-5697-2011; Guntert, Peter/L-5577-2013; Fachbereich14, Dekanat/C-8553-2015","Frueh, Dominique/0000-0003-4605-3776; Guntert, Peter/0000-0002-2911-7574; Dotsch, Volker/0000-0001-5720-212X","NIAID NIH HHS [R01 AI042738, R01 AI042738-09]; NIBIB NIH HHS [P41 EB002026, P41 EB002026-29, P41 EB002026-30, P41 EB002026-31, P41 EB002026-32, P41 EB002026-33]; NIGMS NIH HHS [R01 GM049338, P01 GM047467, P01 GM047467-110009, P01 GM047467-12, P01 GM047467-13, P01 GM047467-14, P01 GM047467-15, P01 GM047467-16, P01 GM047467-160010, P01 GM047467-160012, P01 GM047467-17, P01 GM047467-170012, R01 GM020011, R01 GM020011-28, R01 GM020011-29, R01 GM020011-30, R01 GM020011-31, R01 GM020011-32, R01 GM020011-37, R01 GM020011-38, R01 GM049338-17]",,,40,84,86,0,44,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,14-Aug,2008,454,7206,,,,,907,U68,,10.1038/nature07161,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,336XH,WOS:000258398600041,18704089,No,,,11/20/17

The ESX-1 protein secretion system of Mycobacterium tuberculosis - the causative agent of the human disease tuberculosis - delivers bacterial proteins into host cells during infection and is critical for virulence, but how it is regulated is unknown. Here we show that EspR (also known as Rv3849) is a key regulator of ESX-1 that is required for secretion and virulence in mice. EspR activates transcription of an operon that includes three ESX-1 components, Rv3616c-Rv3614c, whose expression in turn promotes secretion of ESX-1 substrates. EspR directly binds to and activates the Rv3616c-Rv3614c promoter and, unexpectedly, is itself secreted from the bacterial cell by the ESX-1 system that it regulates. Efflux of the DNA-binding regulator results in reduced Rv3616c-Rv3614c transcription, and thus reduced ESX-1 secretion. Our results reveal a direct negative feedback loop that regulates the activity of a secretion system essential for virulence. As the virulence factors secreted by the ESX-1 system are highly antigenic, fine control of secretion may be critical to successful infection.","[Raghavan, Sridharan; Manzanillo, Paolo; Chan, Kaman; Dovey, Cole; Cox, Jeffery S.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Microbiol & Immunol, Program Microbial Pathogenesis & Host Def, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA","Cox, JS (reprint author), Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Microbiol & Immunol, Program Microbial Pathogenesis & Host Def, 600 16th St,Campus Box 2200, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA.",Jeffery.Cox@ucsf.edu,,,"NIAID NIH HHS [AI51667, AI63302, P01 AI063302, P01 AI063302-010001, P01 AI063302-020001, P01 AI063302-030001, P01 AI063302-040001, P01 AI063302-050001, R01 AI051667, R01 AI051667-06, R01 AI051667-07, R01 AI051667-08]",,,40,110,122,0,20,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,7-Aug,2008,454,7205,,,,,717,U49,,10.1038/nature07219,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,334NH,WOS:000258228000035,18685700,No,,,11/20/17

In the case of ligand-activated ion channels, it has been supposed since 1957 that partial agonists evoke a small response because they are inefficient at eliciting the change of conformation between shut and open states of the channel. We have investigated partial agonists for two members of the nicotinic superfamily - the muscle nicotinic acetylcholine receptor and the glycine receptor - and find that the open-shut reaction is similar for both full and partial agonists, but the response to partial agonists is limited by an earlier conformation change ('flipping') that takes place while the channel is still shut. This has implications for the interpretation of structural studies, and in the future, for the design of partial agonists for therapeutic use.","[Lape, Remigijus; Colquhoun, David; Sivilotti, Lucia G.] UCL, Dept Pharmacol, London WC1E 6BT, England","Colquhoun, D (reprint author), UCL, Dept Pharmacol, Med Sci Bldg,Gower St, London WC1E 6BT, England.",d.colquhoun@ucl.ac.uk,"Lape, Remigijus/C-6175-2008; Sivilotti, Lucia/D-8919-2011; Colquhoun, David/C-1664-2008","Lape, Remigijus/0000-0002-6604-0828; Colquhoun, David/0000-0002-4263-017X; Sivilotti, Lucia/0000-0003-2510-8424","Medical Research Council [G0400869, G0400869(72542)]; Wellcome Trust [074491]",,,26,196,197,0,25,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,7-Aug,2008,454,7205,,,,,722,U56,,10.1038/nature07139,,7,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,334NH,WOS:000258228000036,18633353,No,,,11/20/17

In budding yeast, buds are made young whereas ageing factors, such as carbonylated proteins and DNA circles, remain confined to the ageing mother cell. The mechanisms of this confinement and their relevance are poorly understood. Here we show that a septin-dependent, lateral diffusion barrier forms in the nuclear envelope and limits the translocation of pre-existing nuclear pores into the bud. The retention of DNA circles within the mother cell depends on the presence of the diffusion barrier and on the anchorage of the circles to pores mediated by the nuclear basket. In accordance with the diffusion barrier ensuring the asymmetric segregation of nuclear age-determinants, the barrier mutant bud6 Delta fails to properly reset age in buds.

Here we report a simulation that resolves such substructure even in the very inner regions of the Galactic halo. We find hundreds of very concentrated dark matter clumps surviving near the solar circle, as well as numerous cold streams. The simulation also reveals the fractal nature of dark matter clustering: isolated haloes and subhaloes contain the same relative amount of substructure and both have cusped inner density profiles. The inner mass and phase-space densities of subhaloes match those of recently discovered faint, dark-matter-dominated dwarf satellite galaxies(6-8), and the overall amount of substructure can explain the anomalous flux ratios seen in strong gravitational lenses(9,10). Subhaloes boost gamma-ray production from dark matter annihilation by factors of 4 to 15 relative to smooth galactic models. Local cosmic ray production is also enhanced, typically by a factor of 1.4 but by a factor of more than 10 in one per cent of locations lying sufficiently close to a large subhalo.

Many properties of the superfluid depend on the pair size relative to the interparticle spacing. This is expressed in 'BCS-BEC crossover' theories(,)(1-3) describing the crossover from a Bardeen Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS)-type superfluid of loosely bound, large Cooper pairs to Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) of tightly bound molecules. Such a crossover superfluid has been realized in ultracold atomic gases where high-temperature superfluidity has been observed(4,5). The microscopic properties of the fermion pairs can be probed using radio- frequency spectroscopy. However, previous work(6-8) was difficult to interpret owing to strong final-state interactions that were not well understood. Here we realize a superfluid spin mixture in which such interactions have negligible influence and present fermion pair dissociation spectra that reveal the underlying pairing correlations. This allows us to determine that the spectroscopic pair size in the resonantly interacting gas is 20 per cent smaller than the interparticle spacing. These are the smallest pairs so far observed in fermionic superfluids, highlighting the importance of small fermion pairs for superfluidity at high critical temperatures(9). We have also identified transitions from fermion pairs to bound molecular states and to many-body bound states in the case of strong final- state interactions.","[Schunck, Christian H.; Shin, Yong-il; Schirotzek, Andre; Ketterle, Wolfgang] MIT, Dept Phys, MIT Harvard Ctr Ultracold Atoms, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Schunck, Christian H.; Shin, Yong-il; Schirotzek, Andre; Ketterle, Wolfgang] MIT, Elect Res Lab, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA","Schunck, CH (reprint author), MIT, Dept Phys, MIT Harvard Ctr Ultracold Atoms, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",chs@mit.edu,"Shin, Yong-il/B-1955-2008","Shin, Yong-il/0000-0003-0481-9841; Schunck, Christian H/0000-0002-7917-8180",,,,30,75,75,0,16,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,7-Aug,2008,454,7205,,,,,739,U70,,10.1038/nature07176,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,334NH,WOS:000258228000039,18685702,No,,,11/20/17

Recent experiments using Fermi gases have demonstrated a phase transition to a superfluid state with strong interparticle interactions(1-6). This system provides a realization of the 'BCS-BEC crossover'(7) connecting the physics of Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) superconductivity with that of Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs). Although many aspects of this system have been investigated, it has not yet been possible to measure the single-particle excitation spectrum (a fundamental property directly predicted by many-body theories). Here we use photoemission spectroscopy to directly probe the elementary excitations and energy dispersion in a strongly interacting Fermi gas of K-40 atoms. In the experiments, a radio-frequency photon ejects an atom from the strongly interacting system by means of a spin-flip transition to a weakly interacting state. We measure the occupied density of single-particle states at the cusp of the BCS-BEC crossover and on the BEC side of the crossover, and compare these results to that for a nearly ideal Fermi gas. We show that, near the critical temperature, the single-particle spectral function is dramatically altered in a way that is consistent with a large pairing gap. Our results probe the many-body physics in a way that could be compared to data for the high-transition-temperature superconductors. As in photoemission spectroscopy for electronic materials, our measurement technique for ultracold atomic gases directly probes low-energy excitations and thus can reveal excitation gaps and/or pseudogaps. Furthermore, this technique can provide an analogue of angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy for probing anisotropic systems, such as atoms in optical lattice potentials.","[Stewart, J.

This type of configuration is extremely difficult to achieve using established optoelectronics technologies, owing to the intrinsically planar nature of the patterning, deposition, etching, materials growth and doping methods that exist for fabricating such systems. Here we report strategies that avoid these limitations, and implement them to yield high-performance, hemispherical electronic eye cameras based on single-crystalline silicon. The approach uses wafer-scale optoelectronics formed in unusual, two-dimensionally compressible configurations and elastomeric transfer elements capable of transforming the planar layouts in which the systems are initially fabricated into hemispherical geometries for their final implementation.

Here we present (40)Ar-(39)Ar geochronological data on hotspot volcanoes in eastern Australian that reveal a strong link between collision of the Greenland-sized Ontong Java plateau with the Melanesian arc and motion of the Australian plate. The new ages define a short-lived period of reduced northward plate motion between 26 and 23 Myr ago, coincident with an eastward offset in the contemporaneous tracks of seamount chains in the Tasman Sea east of Australia. These features record a brief westward deflection of the Australian plate as the plateau entered and choked the Melanesian trench 26 Myr ago. From 23 Myr ago, Australia returned to a rapid northerly trajectory at roughly the same time that southwest-directed subduction began along the Trobriand trough(6). The timing and brevity of this collisional event correlate well with offsets in hotspot seamount tracks on the Pacific plate, including the archetypal Hawaiian chain(7), and thus provide strong evidence that immense oceanic plateaux, like the Ontong Java, can contribute to initiating rapid change in plate boundaries and motions on a global scale.","[Knesel, Kurt M.; Cohen, Benjamin E.; Vasconcelos, Paulo M.; Thiede, David S.] Univ Queensland, St Lucia, Qld 4072, Australia","Knesel, KM (reprint author), Univ Queensland, St Lucia, Qld 4072, Australia.",k.knesel@uq.edu.au; b.cohen@uq.edu.au,,"Cohen, Benjamin/0000-0002-1634-8998",,,,40,38,38,2,22,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,7-Aug,2008,454,7205,,,,,754,U75,,10.1038/nature07138,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,334NH,WOS:000258228000042,18685705,No,,,11/20/17

The origin of this hemispherical dichotomy is a challenging problem for our understanding of the Earth as a system of dynamically coupled layers. Previously, laboratory experiments have established that thermal control from the lower mantle can drastically affect fluid flow in the outer core(5), which in turn can induce textural heterogeneity on the inner core solidification front(6). The resulting texture should be consistent with other expected manifestations of thermal mantle control on the geodynamo, specifically magnetic flux concentrations(7,8) in the timeaverage palaeomagnetic field(9,10) over the past 5 Myr, and preferred eddy locations(11) in flows imaged below the core-mantle boundary by the analysis of historical geomagnetic secular variation(12). Here we show that a single model of thermochemical convection and dynamo action can account for all these effects by producing a large-scale, long-term outer core flow that couples the heterogeneity of the inner core with that of the lower mantle. The main feature of this thermochemical 'wind' is a cyclonic circulation below Asia, which concentrates magnetic field on the core-mantle boundary at the observed location and locally agrees with core flow images. This wind also causes anomalously high rates of light element release in the eastern hemisphere of the inner core boundary, suggesting that lateral seismic anomalies at the top of the inner core result from mantle-induced variations in its freezing rate.","[Aubert, Julien; Amit, Hagay; Hulot, Gauthier] Univ Paris Diderot, Inst Phys Globe, INSU, CNRS, F-75252 Paris 05, France; [Olson, Peter] Johns Hopkins Univ, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA","Aubert, J (reprint author), Univ Paris Diderot, Inst Phys Globe, INSU, CNRS, 4 Pl Jussieu, F-75252 Paris 05, France.",aubert@ipgp.jussieu.fr,"Aubert, Julien/A-5616-2011; Hulot, Gauthier/A-5627-2011","Aubert, Julien/0000-0002-2756-0724; ",,,,33,133,135,2,30,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,7-Aug,2008,454,7205,,,,,758,U80,,10.1038/nature07109,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,334NH,WOS:000258228000043,18685706,No,,,11/20/17

The expected fates of most gene duplications involve primarily non-adaptive substitutions leading to either non-functionalization of one duplicate copy or subfunctionalization(3), neither of which yields novel function. A significant evolutionary problem is thus elucidating the mechanisms of adaptive evolutionary change leading to evolutionary novelty. Currently, the most widely recognized adaptive process involving gene duplication is neo-functionalization (NEO-F), in which one copy undergoes directional selection to perform a novel function after duplication(4). An alternative, but understudied, adaptive fate that has been proposed is escape from adaptive conflict (EAC), in which a single-copy gene is selected to perform a novel function while maintaining its ancestral function(5,6). This gene is constrained from improving either novel or ancestral function because of detrimental pleiotropic effects on the other function. After duplication, one copy is free to improve novel function, whereas the other is selected to improve ancestral function. Here we first present two criteria that can be used to distinguish NEO-F from EAC. Using both tests for positive selection and assays of enzyme function, we then demonstrate that adaptive evolutionary change in a duplicated gene of the anthocyanin biosynthetic pathway in morning glories (Ipomoea) is best interpreted as EAC. Finally, we argue that this phenomenon likely occurs more often than has been previously believed and may thus represent an important mechanism in generating evolutionary novelty.","[Des Marais, David L.; Rausher, Mark D.] Duke Univ, Dept Biol, Durham, NC 27708 USA; [Des Marais, David L.; Rausher, Mark D.] Duke Univ, Univ Program Genet & Genom, Durham, NC 27708 USA","Des Marais, DL (reprint author), Duke Univ, Dept Biol, Box 90338, Durham, NC 27708 USA.",dld3@duke.edu; mrausher@duke.edu,,,,,,30,172,173,3,53,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,7-Aug,2008,454,7205,,,,,762,U85,,10.1038/nature07092,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,334NH,WOS:000258228000044,18594508,No,,,11/20/17

Our knowledge about the genome-wide distribution of DNA methylation, how it changes during cellular differentiation and how it relates to histone methylation and other chromatin modifications in mammals remains limited. Here we report the generation and analysis of genome-scale DNA methylation profiles at nucleotide resolution in mammalian cells. Using high-throughput reduced representation bisulphite sequencing(6) and single-molecule-based sequencing, we generated DNA methylation maps covering most CpG islands, and a representative sampling of conserved non-coding elements, transposons and other genomic features, for mouse embryonic stem cells, embryonic-stem-cell-derived and primary neural cells, and eight other primary tissues. Several key findings emerge from the data. First, DNA methylation patterns are better correlated with histone methylation patterns than with the underlying genome sequence context. Second, methylation of CpGs are dynamic epigenetic marks that undergo extensive changes during cellular differentiation, particularly in regulatory regions outside of core promoters. Third, analysis of embryonic-stem-cell-derived and primary cells reveals that 'weak' CpG islands associated with a specific set of developmentally regulated genes undergo aberrant hypermethylation during extended proliferation in vitro, in a pattern reminiscent of that reported in some primary tumours. More generally, the results establish reduced representation bisulphite sequencing as a powerful technology for epigenetic profiling of cell populations relevant to developmental biology, cancer and regenerative medicine.","[Meissner, Alexander; Wernig, Marius; Hanna, Jacob; Jaenisch, Rudolf; Lander, Eric S.] Whitehead Inst Biomed Res, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; [Meissner, Alexander; Mikkelsen, Tarjei S.; Gu, Hongcang; Sivachenko, Andrey; Zhang, Xiaolan; Bernstein, Bradley E.; Nusbaum, Chad; Jaffe, David B.; Gnirke, Andreas; Lander, Eric S.] Broad Inst MIT & Harvard, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; [Meissner, Alexander] Harvard Univ, Dept Stem Cell & Regenerat Biol, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Mikkelsen, Tarjei S.] MIT, Div Hlth Sci & Technol, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Bernstein, Bradley E.] Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Mol Pathol Unit, Charlestown, MA 02129 USA; [Bernstein, Bradley E.] Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Canc Res Ctr, Charlestown, MA 02129 USA; [Bernstein, Bradley E.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Pathol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Jaenisch, Rudolf; Lander, Eric S.] MIT, Dept Biol, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Lander, Eric S.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Syst Biol, Boston, MA 02114 USA","Jaenisch, R (reprint author), Whitehead Inst Biomed Res, 9 Cambridge Ctr, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA.",jaenisch@wi.mit.edu; lander@broad.mit.edu,"Mikkelsen, Tarjei/A-1306-2007; HANNA, JACOB/K-1339-2012","Mikkelsen, Tarjei/0000-0002-8133-3135; HANNA, JACOB/0000-0003-2042-9974","NHGRI NIH HHS [R01 HG004401-02, R01 HG004401, U54 HG003067, U54 HG003067-04, U54 HG003067-06]",,,30,1402,1435,20,229,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,7-Aug,2008,454,7205,,,,,766,U91,,10.1038/nature07107,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,334NH,WOS:000258228000045,18600261,No,Y,N,11/20/17

In contrast, the body temperature of poikilotherms, for example Drosophila, is the result of heat exchange with the surrounding environment as a result of the large ratio of surface area to volume of their bodies(1,2). Accordingly, these animals must instinctively move to places with an environmental temperature as close as possible to their genetically determined desired temperature. The temperature that Drosophila instinctively prefers has a function equivalent to the 'set point' temperature in mammals. Although various temperature-gated TRP channels have been discovered(3,4), molecular and cellular components in Drosophila brain responsible for determining the desired temperature remain unknown. We identified these components by performing a large-scale genetic screen of temperature preference behaviour (TPB) in Drosophila(5,6). In parallel, we mapped areas of the Drosophila brain controlling TPB by targeted inactivation of neurons with tetanus toxin(7) and a potassium channel (Kir2.1)(8) driven with various brain-specific GAL4s. Here we show that mushroom bodies (MBs) and the cyclic AMP-cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (cAMP-PKA) pathway are essential for controlling TPB. Furthermore, targeted expression of cAMP-PKA pathway components in only the MB was sufficient to rescue abnormal TPB of the corresponding mutants. Preferred temperatures were affected by the level of cAMP and PKA activity in the MBs in various PKA pathway mutants.","[Hong, Sung-Tae; Bang, Sunhoe; Hyun, Seogang; Kang, Jongkyun; Jeong, Kyunghwa; Paik, Donggi; Chung, Jongkyeong; Kim, Jaeseob] Korea Adv Inst Sci & Technol, Dept Biol Sci, Taejon 305701, South Korea","Kim, J (reprint author), Korea Adv Inst Sci & Technol, Dept Biol Sci, Taejon 305701, South Korea.",kjaeseob@kaist.ac.kr,,,,,,27,37,39,2,10,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,7-Aug,2008,454,7205,,,,,771,U97,,10.1038/nature07090,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,334NH,WOS:000258228000046,18594510,No,,,11/20/17

Recent studies have demonstrated specific functions for p110 alpha in growth factor and insulin signalling(6-8). To probe for distinct functions of p110 beta, we constructed conditional knockout mice. Here we show that ablation of p110 beta in the livers of the resulting mice leads to impaired insulin sensitivity and glucose homeostasis, while having little effect on phosphorylation of Akt, suggesting the involvement of a kinase-independent role of p110 beta in insulin metabolic action. Using established mouse embryonic fibroblasts, we found that removal of p110 beta also had little effect on Akt phosphorylation in response to stimulation by insulin and epidermal growth factor, but resulted in retarded cell proliferation. Reconstitution of p110 beta-null cells with a wild-type or kinase-dead allele of p110 beta demonstrated that p110 beta possesses kinase-independent functions in regulating cell proliferation and trafficking. However, the kinase activity of p110 beta was required for G-protein-coupled receptor signalling triggered by lysophosphatidic acid and had a function in oncogenic transformation. Most strikingly, in an animal model of prostate tumour formation induced by Pten loss, ablation of p110 beta (also known as Pik3cb), but not that of p110 alpha (also known as Pik3ca), impeded tumorigenesis with a concomitant diminution of Akt phosphorylation. Taken together, our findings demonstrate both kinase-dependent and kinase-independent functions for p110 beta, and strongly indicate the kinase-dependent functions of p110 beta as a promising target in cancer therapy.","[Jia, Shidong; Liu, Zhenning; Zhang, Sen; Liu, Pixu; Zhang, Lei; Lee, Sang Hyun; Zhang, Jing; Roberts, Thomas M.; Zhao, Jean J.] Dana Farber Canc Inst, Dept Canc Biol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Signoretti, Sabina; Loda, Massimo] Dana Farber Canc Inst, Dept Med Oncol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Jia, Shidong; Liu, Zhenning; Zhang, Sen; Liu, Pixu; Zhang, Lei; Lee, Sang Hyun; Zhang, Jing; Signoretti, Sabina; Loda, Massimo; Roberts, Thomas M.; Zhao, Jean J.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Brigham & Womens Hosp, Dept Pathol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Zhao, Jean J.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Brigham & Womens Hosp, Dept Surg, Boston, MA 02115 USA","Roberts, TM (reprint author), Dana Farber Canc Inst, Dept Canc Biol, Boston, MA 02115 USA.",thomas_roberts@dfci.harvard.edu; jean_zhao@dfci.harvard.edu,,,"NCI NIH HHS [P01 CA050661, P01 CA050661-200001, P01 CA089021, P01 CA089021-06A1, P50 CA089393, P50 CA089393-08S1, P50 CA090381, P50 CA090381-05, R01 CA030002, R01 CA030002-27, R01 CA131945, R01 CA134502, R01 CA134502-01]",,,34,410,432,2,31,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,7-Aug,2008,454,7205,,,,,776,U102,,10.1038/nature07091,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,334NH,WOS:000258228000047,18594509,No,,,11/20/17

However, the mechanisms that allow establishment and maintenance of the latent state remain poorly understood. Herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) establishes latency in neurons of sensory ganglia, where the only abundant viral gene product is a non-coding RNA, the latency associated transcript (LAT)(1,2). Here we show that LAT functions as a primary microRNA (miRNA) precursor that encodes four distinct miRNAs in HSV-1 infected cells. One of these miRNAs, miR-H2-3p, is transcribed in an antisense orientation to ICP0-a viral immediate-early transcriptional activator that is important for productive HSV-1 replication and thought to have a role in reactivation from latency(3). We show that miR-H2-3p is able to reduce ICP0 protein expression, but does not significantly affect ICP0 messenger RNA levels. We also identified a fifth HSV-1 miRNA in latently infected trigeminal ganglia, miR-H6, which derives from a previously unknown transcript distinct from LAT. miR-H6 shows extended seed complementarity to the mRNA encoding a second HSV-1 transcription factor, ICP4, and inhibits expression of ICP4, which is required for expression of most HSV-1 genes during productive infection(4). These results may explain the reported ability of LAT to promote latency(5-9). Thus, HSV-1 expresses at least two primary miRNA precursors in latently infected neurons that may facilitate the establishment and maintenance of viral latency by post-transcriptionally regulating viral gene expression.","[Umbach, Jennifer Lin; Karnowski, Heather W.; Cullen, Bryan R.] Duke Univ, Med Ctr, Dept Mol Genet & Microbiol, Durham, NC 27710 USA; [Umbach, Jennifer Lin; Karnowski, Heather W.; Cullen, Bryan R.] Duke Univ, Med Ctr, Ctr Virol, Durham, NC 27710 USA; [Kramer, Martha F.; Jurak, Igor; Coen, Donald M.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Biol Chem & Mol Pharmacol, Boston, MA 02115 USA","Cullen, BR (reprint author), Duke Univ, Med Ctr, Dept Mol Genet & Microbiol, Durham, NC 27710 USA.",culle002@mc.duke.edu,,,"NCI NIH HHS [T32 CA009111]; NIAID NIH HHS [R01 AI067968, R01 AI067968-02, R01 AI067968-03]",,,37,369,397,4,52,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,7-Aug,2008,454,7205,,,,,780,U108,,10.1038/nature07103,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,334NH,WOS:000258228000048,18596690,No,Y,N,11/20/17

NTs bind to two distinct classes of glycosylated receptor: the p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75(NTR)) and tyrosine kinase receptors (Trks). Whereas p75(NTR) binds to all NTs, the Trk subtypes are specific for each NT1,2. The question of whether NTs stimulate p75(NTR) by inducing receptor homodimerization is still under debate. Here we report the 2.6-angstrom resolution crystal structure of neurotrophin-3 (NT-3) complexed to the ectodomain of glycosylated p75(NTR). In contrast to the previously reported asymmetric complex structure, which contains a dimer of nerve growth factor (NGF) bound to a single ectodomain of deglycosylated p75(NTR) (ref. 3), we show that NT-3 forms a central homodimer around which two glycosylated p75(NTR) molecules bind symmetrically. Symmetrical binding occurs along the NT-3 interfaces, resulting in a 2:2 ligand-receptor cluster. A comparison of the symmetrical and asymmetric structures reveals significant differences in ligand receptor interactions and p75(NTR) conformations. Biochemical experiments indicate that both NT-3 and NGF bind to p75(NTR) with 2:2 stoichiometry in solution, whereas the 2:1 complexes are the result of artificial deglycosylation. We therefore propose that the symmetrical 2:2 complex reflects a native state of p75(NTR) activation at the cell surface.

Many bacteria use acyl- homoserine lactone ( acyl- HSL) synthases to generate fatty acyl- HSL quorum- sensing signals, which function with signal receptors to control expression of specific genes. The fatty acyl group is derived from fatty acid biosynthesis and provides signal specificity, but the variety of signals is limited. Here we show that the photosynthetic bacterium Rhodopseudomonas palustris uses an acyl- HSL synthase to produce p- coumaroyl- HSL by using environmental p- coumaric acid rather than fatty acids from cellular pools. The bacterium has a signal receptor with homology to fatty acyl- HSL receptors that responds to p- coumaroyl- HSL to regulate global gene expression. We also found that p- coumaroyl- HSL is made by other bacteria including Bradyrhizobium sp. and Silicibacter pomeroyi. This discovery extends the range of possibilities for acyl- HSL quorum sensing and raises fundamental questions about quorum sensing within the context of environmental signalling.","[Schaefer, Amy L.; Greenberg, E.

Here, using the converse behavioural states of fear extinction and its context- dependent renewal as a model in mice, we show that bi- directional transitions between states of high and low fear are triggered by a rapid switch in the balance of activity between two distinct populations of basal amygdala neurons. These two populations are integrated into discrete neuronal circuits differentially connected with the hippocampus and the medial prefrontal cortex. Targeted and reversible neuronal inactivation of the basal amygdala prevents behavioural changes without affecting memory or expression of behaviour. Our findings indicate that switching between distinct behavioural states can be triggered by selective activation of specific neuronal circuits integrating sensory and contextual information. These observations provide a new framework for understanding context- dependent changes of fear behaviour.","[Herry, Cyril; Ciocchi, Stephane; Senn, Verena; Demmou, Lynda; Mueller, Christian; Luethi, Andreas] Friedrich Miescher Inst Biomed Res, CH-4058 Basel, Switzerland","Luthi, A (reprint author), Friedrich Miescher Inst Biomed Res, Maulbeerstr 66, CH-4058 Basel, Switzerland.",cyril.herry@fmi.ch; andreas.luthi@fmi.ch,,,,,,50,432,444,2,62,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,31-Jul,2008,454,7204,,,,,600,U28,,10.1038/nature07166,,9,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,331QC,WOS:000258026500038,18615015,No,Y,N,11/20/17

This dichotomy between 'local- moment' magnetism and 'itinerant- electron' magnetism is reminiscent of the valence bond/ molecular orbital dichotomy present in studies of chemical bonding. The class of heavy- electron intermetallic compounds of cerium, ytterbium and various 5f elements bridges the extremes, with itinerant- electron magnetic characteristics at low temperatures that grow out of a high-temperature local- moment state(1). Describing this transition quantitatively has proved difficult, and one of the main unsolved problems is finding what determines the temperature scale for the evolution of this behaviour. Here we present a simple, semi-quantitative solution to this problem that provides a basic framework for interpreting the physics of heavy- electron materials and offers the prospect of a quantitative determination of the physical origin of their magnetic ordering and superconductivity. It also reveals the difference between the temperature scales that distinguish the conduction electrons' response to a single magnetic impurity and their response to a lattice of local moments, and provides an updated version of the well- known Doniach diagram(2).","[Yang, Yi-feng; Lee, Han-Oh; Thompson, J.

The upper back dial is a 19- year calendar, based on the Metonic cycle, arranged as a five- turn spiral(1,6,8). The lower back dial is a Saros eclipse- prediction dial, arranged as a four- turn spiral of 223 lunar months, with glyphs indicating eclipse predictions(6). Here we add surprising findings concerning these back dials. Though no month names on the Metonic calendar were previously known, we have now identified all 12 months, which are unexpectedly of Corinthian origin. The Corinthian colonies of northwestern Greece or Syracuse in Sicily are leading contenders - the latter suggesting a heritage going back to Archimedes. Calendars with excluded days to regulate month lengths, described in a first century BC source(9), have hitherto been dismissed as implausible(10,11). We demonstrate their existence in the Antikythera calendar, and in the process establish why the Metonic dial has five turns. The upper subsidiary dial is not a 76- year Callippic dial as previously thought(8), but follows the four- year cycle of the Olympiad and its associated Panhellenic Games. Newly identified index letters in each glyph on the Saros dial show that a previous reconstruction needs modification(6). We explore models for generating the unusual glyph distribution, and show how the eclipse times appear to be contradictory. We explain the four turns of the Saros dial in terms of the full moon cycle and the Exeligmos dial as indicating a necessary correction to the predicted eclipse times. The new results on the Metonic calendar, Olympiad dial and eclipse prediction link the cycles of human institutions with the celestial cycles embedded in the Mechanism's gearwork.","[Freeth, Tony; Bitsakis, Yanis] Antikythera Mech Res Project, Cardiff CF23 5QP, Wales; [Freeth, Tony] Images First Ltd, London W5 4SE, England; [Jones, Alexander] Inst Study Ancient World, New York, NY 10028 USA; [Steele, John M.] Univ Durham, Dept Phys, Durham DH1 3LE, England; [Bitsakis, Yanis] Ctr Hist & Palaeog, GR-10560 Athens, Greece","Freeth, T (reprint author), Antikythera Mech Res Project, 3 Tyrwhitt Crescent,Roath Pk, Cardiff CF23 5QP, Wales.",tony@images-first.com,,,,,,24,45,45,0,16,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,31-Jul,2008,454,7204,,,,,614,617,,10.1038/nature07130,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,331QC,WOS:000258026500041,18668103,No,,,11/20/17

Supramolecular self- assembly on surfaces offers attractive features in this regard: it is a 'bottom- up' approach and thus allows the simple and rapid creation of surface assemblies(1,2), which are readily tuned through the choice of molecular building blocks used and stabilized by hydrogen bonding(3-8), van der Waals interactions(9), pi-pi bonding(10,11) or metal coordination(12,13) between the blocks. Assemblies in the form of two- dimensional open networks(3,9,10,13-17) are of particular interest for possible applications because well- defined pores can be used for the precise localization and confinement of guest entities such as molecules or clusters, which can add functionality to the supramolecular network. Another widely used method for producing surface structures involves self- assembled monolayers (SAMs)(18), which have introduced unprecedented flexibility in our ability to tailor interfaces and generate patterned surfaces(19-22). But SAMs are part of a top-down technology that is limited in terms of the spatial resolution that can be achieved. We therefore rationalized that a particularly powerful fabrication platform might be realized by combining non- covalent self- assembly of porous networks and SAMs, with the former providing nanometre- scale precision and the latter allowing versatile functionalization. Here we show that the two strategies can indeed be combined to create integrated network SAM hybrid systems that are sufficiently robust for further processing. We show that the supramolecular network and the SAM can both be deposited from solution, which should enable the widespread and flexible use of this combined fabrication method.","[Madueno, Rafael; Raisanen, Minna T.; Silien, Christophe; Buck, Manfred] Univ St Andrews, EaStCHEM Sch Chem, St Andrews KY16 9ST, Fife, Scotland","Buck, M (reprint author), Univ St Andrews, EaStCHEM Sch Chem, St Andrews KY16 9ST, Fife, Scotland.",rafael.madueno@uco.es; mb45@st-and.ac.uk,"Buck, Manfred/G-5508-2017","Buck, Manfred/0000-0003-1225-7607; Madueno, Rafael/0000-0002-2579-4113",,,,30,258,259,18,196,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,31-Jul,2008,454,7204,,,,,618,621,,10.1038/nature07096,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,331QC,WOS:000258026500042,18668104,No,Y,N,11/20/17

Identifying the composition of these primary melts in the mantle is crucial for establishing links between mantle geochemical 'reservoirs' and fundamental geodynamic processes(2). Mineral inclusions in natural diamonds have provided a unique window into such deep mantle processes(3-8). Here we provide experimental and geochemical evidence that silicate mineral inclusions in diamonds from Juina, Brazil, crystallized from primary and evolved carbonatite melts in the mantle transition zone and deep upper mantle. The incompatible trace element abundances calculated for a melt coexisting with a calcium-titanium- silicate perovskite inclusion indicate deep melting of carbonated oceanic crust, probably at transition- zone depths. Further to perovskite, calcic- majorite garnet inclusions record crystallization in the deep upper mantle from an evolved melt that closely resembles estimates of primitive carbonatite on the basis of volcanic rocks. Small- degree melts of subducted crust can be viewed as agents of chemical mass- transfer in the upper mantle and transition zone, leaving a chemical imprint of ocean crust that can possibly endure for billions of years.","[Walter, M.

Although many different environmental perturbations have been invoked as extinction mechanisms(1-3), it has long been recognized that fluctuations in sea level coincide with many episodes of biotic turnover(4-6). Recent work supports the hypothesis that changes in the areas of epicontinental seas have influenced the macroevolution of marine animals(7,8), but the extent to which differential environmental turnover has contributed to extinction selectivity remains unknown. Here I use a new compilation of the temporal durations of sedimentary rock packages to show that carbonate and terrigenous clastic marine shelf environments have different spatio- temporal dynamics and that these dynamics predict patterns of genus- level extinction, extinction selectivity and diversity among Sepkoski's Palaeozoic and modern evolutionary faunae(9). These results do not preclude a role for biological interactions or unusual physical events as drivers of macroevolution, but they do suggest that the turnover of marine shelf habitats and correlated environmental changes have been consistent determinants of extinction, extinction selectivity and the shifting composition of the marine biota during the Phanerozoic eon.","[Peters, Shanan E.] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Geol & Geophys, Madison, WI 53706 USA","Peters, SE (reprint author), Univ Wisconsin, Dept Geol & Geophys, 1215 W Dayton St, Madison, WI 53706 USA.",peters@geology.wisc.edu,"Peters, Shanan/A-5620-2013","Peters, Shanan/0000-0002-3346-4317",,,,30,74,77,4,38,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,31-Jul,2008,454,7204,,,,,626,U38,,10.1038/nature07032,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,331QC,WOS:000258026500044,18552839,No,,,11/20/17

Various front- and rear- fanged groups are recognized, according to whether their fangs are positioned anterior ( for example cobras and vipers) or posterior ( for example grass snakes) in the upper jaw(3-5). A fundamental controversy in snake evolution is whether or not front and rear fangs share the same evolutionary and developmental origin(3-9). Resolving this controversy could identify a major evolutionary transition underlying the massive radiation of advanced snakes, and the associated developmental events. Here we examine this issue by visualizing the tooth- forming epithelium in the upper jaw of 96 snake embryos, covering eight species. We use the sonic hedgehog gene as a marker(10-13), and three- dimensionally reconstruct the development in 41 of the embryos. We show that front fangs develop from the posterior end of the upper jaw, and are strikingly similar in morphogenesis to rear fangs. This is consistent with their being homologous. In front- fanged snakes, the anterior part of the upper jaw lacks sonic hedgehog expression, and ontogenetic allometry displaces the fang from its posterior developmental origin to its adult front position - consistent with an ancestral posterior position of the front fang. In rear- fanged snakes, the fangs develop from an independent posterior dental lamina and retain their posterior position. In light of our findings, we put forward a new model for the evolution of snake fangs: a posterior subregion of the tooth- forming epithelium became developmentally uncoupled from the remaining dentition, which allowed the posterior teeth to evolve independently and in close association with the venom gland, becoming highly modified in different lineages. This developmental event could have facilitated the massive radiation of advanced snakes in the Cenozoic era, resulting in the spectacular diversity of snakes seen today(6,14,15).","[Vonk, Freek J.; Admiraal, Jeroen F.; de Bakker, Merijn A.

Epidemiological applications have been anticipated for disease systems where the host is a plant or volume of soil(2,3), and hence is fixed in space. However, no natural examples have been reported. The central question of interest in percolation theory(4), the possibility of an infinite connected cluster, corresponds in infectious disease to a positive probability of an epidemic. Archived records of plague ( infection with Yersinia pestis) in populations of great gerbils ( Rhombomys opimus) in Kazakhstan have been used to show that epizootics only occur when more than about 0.33 of the burrow systems built by the host are occupied by family groups(5). The underlying mechanism for this abundance threshold is unknown. Here we present evidence that it is a percolation threshold, which arises from the difference in scale between the movements that transport infectious fleas between family groups and the vast size of contiguous landscapes colonized by gerbils. Conventional theory predicts that abundance thresholds for the spread of infectious disease arise when transmission between hosts is density dependent such that the basic reproduction number ( R(0)) increases with abundance, attaining 1 at the threshold. Percolation thresholds, however, are separate, spatially explicit thresholds that indicate long- range connectivity in a system and do not coincide with R(0) = 1. Abundance thresholds are the theoretical basis for attempts to manage infectious disease by reducing the abundance of susceptibles, including vaccination and the culling of wildlife(6-8). This first natural example of a percolation threshold in a disease system invites a re- appraisal of other invasion thresholds, such as those for epidemic viral infections in African lions ( Panthera leo), and of other disease systems such as bovine tuberculosis ( caused by Mycobacterium bovis) in badgers ( Meles meles).","[Davis, S.; Heesterbeek, J.

Limb bud outgrowth is driven by signals in a positive feedback loop involving fibroblast growth factor ( Fgf) genes, sonic hedgehog ( Shh) and Gremlin1 ( Grem1)(1). Precise termination of these signals is essential to restrict limb bud size(2-4). The current model predicts a sequence of signal termination consistent with that in chick limb buds(4). Our finding that the sequence in mouse limb buds is different led us to explore alternative mechanisms. Here we show, by analysing compound mouse mutants defective in genes comprising the positive loop, genetic evidence that FGF signalling can repress Grem1 expression, revealing a novel Fgf/Grem1 inhibitory loop. This repression occurs both in mouse and chick limb buds, and is dependent on high FGF activity. These data support a mechanism where the positive Fgf/ Shh loop drives outgrowth and an increase in FGF signalling, which triggers the Fgf/ Grem1 inhibitory loop. The inhibitory loop then operates to terminate outgrowth signals in the order observed in either mouse or chick limb buds. Our study unveils the concept of a self- promoting and self- terminating circuit that may be used to attain proper tissue size in a broad spectrum of developmental and regenerative settings.","[Verheyden, Jamie M.; Sun, Xin] Univ Wisconsin, Genet Lab, Madison, WI 53706 USA","Sun, X (reprint author), Univ Wisconsin, Genet Lab, Madison, WI 53706 USA.",xsun@wisc.edu,,,"NICHD NIH HHS [R01 HD045522-01A1, R01 HD045522, R01 HD045522-02, R01 HD045522-03, R01 HD045522-04, R01 HD045522-05, R01 HD045522-05S1]; NIGMS NIH HHS [5T32GM07133, T32 GM007133, T32 GM007133-24, T32 GM007133-25, T32 GM007133-26, T32 GM007133-27]",,,32,101,104,0,7,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,31-Jul,2008,454,7204,,,,,638,U45,,10.1038/nature07085,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,331QC,WOS:000258026500047,18594511,No,,,11/20/17

In mammals, repeated presentations of a conditioned stimulus that was previously paired to a noxious stimulus leads to the gradual disappearance of conditioned fear responses. Although much evidence suggests that this extinction process depends on plastic events in the amygdala(1-7), the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Intercalated ( ITC) amygdala neurons constitute probable mediators of extinction because they receive information about the conditioned stimulus from the basolateral amygdala ( BLA)(8,9), and contribute inhibitory projections to the central nucleus ( CEA)(10,11), the main output station of the amygdala for conditioned fear responses(12). Thus, after extinction training, ITC cells could reduce the impact of conditioned- stimulus- related BLA inputs to the CEA by means of feed- forward inhibition. Here we test the hypothesis that ITC neurons mediate extinction by lesioning them with a toxin that selectively targets cells expressing mu- opioid receptors (mu ORs). Electron microscopic observations revealed that the incidence of mu OR- immunoreactive synapses is much higher in ITC cell clusters than in the BLA or CEA and that mORs typically have a post- synaptic location in ITC cells. In keeping with this, bilateral infusions of the mu OR agonist dermorphin conjugated to the toxin saporin in the vicinity of ITC neurons caused a 34% reduction in the number of ITC cells but no significant cell loss in surrounding nuclei. Moreover, ITC lesions caused a marked deficit in the expression of extinction that correlated negatively with the number of surviving ITC neurons but not CEA cells. Because ITC cells exhibit an unusual pattern of receptor expression, these findings open new avenues for the treatment of anxiety disorders.","[Likhtik, Ekaterina; Popa, Daniela; Apergis-Schoute, John; Fidacaro, George A., Jr.; Pare, Denis] Rutgers State Univ, Ctr Mol & Behav Neurosci, Newark, NJ 07102 USA","Pare, D (reprint author), Rutgers State Univ, Ctr Mol & Behav Neurosci, Newark, NJ 07102 USA.",pare@andromeda.rutgers.edu,,"Popa, Daniela/0000-0002-8389-1122","NIMH NIH HHS [R01 MH073610-04, F31 MH076415, F31 MH076415-02, F31 MH76415, R01 MH073610, R01MH-073610]",,,30,249,253,1,25,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,31-Jul,2008,454,7204,,,,,642,U48,,10.1038/nature07167,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,331QC,WOS:000258026500048,18615014,No,,,11/20/17

Reprogramming of mouse and human somatic cells into pluripotent stem cells, designated as induced pluripotent stem ( iPS) cells, has been possible with the expression of the transcription factor quartet Oct4 ( also known as Pou5f1), Sox2, c- Myc and Klf4 ( refs 1 - 11). Considering that ectopic expression of c- Myc causes tumorigenicity in offspring(2) and that retroviruses themselves can cause insertional mutagenesis, the generation of iPS cells with a minimal number of factors may hasten the clinical application of this approach. Here we show that adult mouse neural stem cells express higher endogenous levels of Sox2 and c- Myc than embryonic stem cells, and that exogenous Oct4 together with either Klf4 or c- Myc is sufficient to generate iPS cells from neural stem cells. These two- factor iPS cells are similar to embryonic stem cells at the molecular level, contribute to development of the germ line, and form chimaeras. We propose that, in inducing pluripotency, the number of reprogramming factors can be reduced when using somatic cells that endogenously express appropriate levels of complementing factors.","[Kim, Jeong Beom; Zaehres, Holm; Wu, Guangming; Gentile, Luca; Ko, Kinarm; Sebastiano, Vittorio; Arauzo-Bravo, Marcos J.; Han, Dong Wook; Schoeler, Hans R.] Max Planck Inst Mol Biomed, Dept Cell & Dev Biol, D-48149 Munster, Germany; [Ruau, David; Zenke, Martin] Univ Aachen, Sch Med, Rhein Westfal TH Aachen, Inst Biomed Engn,Dept Cell Biol, D-52074 Aachen, Germany","Scholer, HR (reprint author), Max Planck Inst Mol Biomed, Dept Cell & Dev Biol, Rontgenstr 20, D-48149 Munster, Germany.",schoeler@mpi-muenster.mpg.de,"Marcos, Arauzo-Bravo/A-1706-2011; Han, Dong Wook/D-6041-2011; Gentile, Luca/L-4473-2014","Marcos, Arauzo-Bravo/0000-0002-3264-464X; Scholer, Hans/0000-0003-2643-5136",,,,26,635,713,3,81,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,31-Jul,2008,454,7204,,,,,646,U54,,10.1038/nature07061,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,331QC,WOS:000258026500049,18594515,No,Y,N,11/20/17

In the mammalian intestine, ISC self renewal, amplification and differentiation take place along the crypt - villus axis, and are controlled by the Wnt and hedgehog ( Hh) signalling pathways(1). However, little is known about the mechanisms that specify ISCs within the developing intestinal epithelium, or about the signalling centres that help maintain them in their self- renewing stem cell state. Here we show that in adult Drosophila melanogaster, ISCs of the posterior intestine ( hindgut) are confined to an anterior narrow segment, which we name the hindgut proliferation zone ( HPZ). Within the HPZ, self renewal of ISCs, as well as subsequent proliferation and differentiation of ISC descendants, are controlled by locally emanating Wingless ( Wg, a Drosophila Wnt homologue) and Hh signals. The anteriorly restricted expression of Wg in the HPZ acts as a niche signal that maintains cells in a slow- cycling, self- renewing mode. As cells divide and move posteriorly away from the Wg source, they enter a phase of rapid proliferation. During this phase, Hh signal is required for exiting the cell cycle and the onset of differentiation. The HPZ, with its characteristic proliferation dynamics and signalling properties, is set up during the embryonic phase and becomes active in the larva, where it generates all adult hindgut cells including ISCs. The mechanism and genetic control of cell renewal in the Drosophila HPZ exhibits a large degree of similarity with what is seen in the mammalian intestine. Our analysis of the Drosophila HPZ provides an insight into the specification and control of stem cells, highlighting the way in which the spatial pattern of signals that promote self renewal, growth and differentiation is set up within a genetically tractable model system.","[Takashima, Shigeo; Mkrtchyan, Marianna; Younossi-Hartenstein, Amelia; Merriam, John R.; Hartenstein, Volker] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Mol Cell & Dev Biol, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA","Hartenstein, V (reprint author), Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Mol Cell & Dev Biol, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.",volkerh@mcdb.ucla.edu,,,,,,20,111,117,1,19,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,31-Jul,2008,454,7204,,,,,651,U58,,10.1038/nature07156,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,331QC,WOS:000258026500050,18633350,No,,,11/20/17

Vascular endothelial growth factors ( VEGFs) stimulate angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis by activating VEGF receptor ( VEGFR) tyrosine kinases in endothelial cells(2). VEGFR- 3 ( also known as FLT- 4) is present in all endothelia during development, and in the adult it becomes restricted to the lymphatic endothelium(3). However, VEGFR- 3 is upregulated in the microvasculature of tumours and wounds(4,5). Here we demonstrate that VEGFR- 3 is highly expressed in angiogenic sprouts, and genetic targeting of VEGFR- 3 or blocking of VEGFR- 3 signalling with monoclonal antibodies results in decreased sprouting, vascular density, vessel branching and endothelial cell proliferation in mouse angiogenesis models. Stimulation of VEGFR- 3 augmented VEGF- induced angiogenesis and sustained angiogenesis even in the presence of VEGFR- 2 ( also known as KDR or FLK- 1) inhibitors, whereas antibodies against VEGFR- 3 and VEGFR- 2 in combination resulted in additive inhibition of angiogenesis and tumour growth. Furthermore, genetic or pharmacological disruption of the Notch signalling pathway led to widespread endothelial VEGFR- 3 expression and excessive sprouting, which was inhibited by blocking VEGFR- 3 signals. Our results implicate VEGFR- 3 as a regulator of vascular network formation. Targeting VEGFR- 3 may provide additional efficacy for anti- angiogenic therapies, especially towards vessels that are resistant to VEGF or VEGFR- 2 inhibitors.","[Tammela, Tuomas; Zarkada, Georgia; Murtomaki, Aino; Wirzenius, Maria; Waltari, Marika; Laakkonen, Pirjo; Alitalo, Kari] Univ Helsinki, Lab Mol Canc Biol, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland; [Tammela, Tuomas; Zarkada, Georgia; Murtomaki, Aino; Wirzenius, Maria; Waltari, Marika; Laakkonen, Pirjo; Alitalo, Kari] Univ Helsinki, Ludwig Inst Canc Res, Biomedicum Helsinki, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland; [Tammela, Tuomas; Zarkada, Georgia; Murtomaki, Aino; Wirzenius, Maria; Waltari, Marika; Laakkonen, Pirjo; Alitalo, Kari] Univ Helsinki, Haartman Inst, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland; [Wallgard, Elisabet; Hellstrom, Mats; Betsholtz, Christer] Karolinska Inst, Div Matrix Biol, Dept Med Biochem & Biophys, S-17177 Stockholm, Sweden; [Suchting, Steven; Freitas, Catarina; Eichmann, Anne] Coll France, INSERM, U833, F-75005 Paris, France; [Schomber, Tibor; Christofori, Gerhard] Univ Basel, Ctr Biomed, Dept Clin Biol Sci, CH-4058 Basel, Switzerland; [Peltonen, Reetta; Isoniemi, Helena] Univ Helsinki, Cent Hosp, Dept Transplantat & Hepat Surg, Helsinki 00029, Finland; [Duarte, Antonio] Univ Tecn Lisbon, Fac Vet Med, Interdisciplinary Ctr Res Anim Hlth CIISA, P-1300474 Lisbon, Portugal; [Yla-Herttuala, Seppo] Univ Kuopio, AI Virtanen Inst, FIN-70211 Kuopio, Finland; [Shibuya, Masabumi] Tokyo Med & Dent Univ, Dept Mol Oncol, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo 1138519, Japan; [Pytowski, Bronislaw] ImClone Syst, New York, NY 10014 USA","Alitalo, K (reprint author), Univ Helsinki, Lab Mol Canc Biol, POB 63,Haartmaninkatu 8, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland.",kari.alitalo@helsinki.fi,"CIISA, FMV/D-2242-2016; Freitas, Catarina/A-2555-2017; Alitalo, Kari/J-5013-2014","Freitas, Catarina/0000-0002-3393-5326; Alitalo, Kari/0000-0002-7331-0902; Hellstrom, Mats/0000-0002-7088-9533; /0000-0003-3675-6961; Duarte, Antonio/0000-0002-9255-3635; Laakkonen, Pirjo/0000-0002-9620-095X; Yla-Herttuala, Seppo/0000-0001-7593-2708",NHLBI NIH HHS [5 R01 HL075183-02],,,50,453,469,2,58,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,31-Jul,2008,454,7204,,,,,656,U68,,10.1038/nature07083,,8,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,331QC,WOS:000258026500051,18594512,No,,,11/20/17

The two recombination outcomes, crossover and non-crossover, increase genetic diversity, but have the potential to homogenize alleles by gene conversion. Whereas crossover rates vary considerably across the genome, non-crossovers and gene conversions have only been identified in a handful of loci. To examine recombination genome wide and at high spatial resolution, we generated maps of crossovers, crossover-associated gene conversion and non-crossover gene conversion using dense genetic marker data collected from all four products of fifty-six yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) meioses. Our maps reveal differences in the distributions of crossovers and non-crossovers, showing more regions where either crossovers or non-crossovers are favoured than expected by chance. Furthermore, we detect evidence for interference between crossovers and non-crossovers, a phenomenon previously only known to occur between crossovers. Up to 1% of the genome of each meiotic product is subject to gene conversion in a single meiosis, with detectable bias towards GC nucleotides. To our knowledge the maps represent the first high-resolution, genome-wide characterization of the multiple outcomes of recombination in any organism. In addition, because non-crossover hotspots create holes of reduced linkage within haplotype blocks, our results stress the need to incorporate non-crossovers into genetic linkage analysis.","[Mancera, Eugenio; Steinmetz, Lars M.] European Mol Biol Lab, D-69117 Heidelberg, Germany; [Bourgon, Richard; Brozzi, Alessandro; Huber, Wolfgang] European Bioinformat Inst, European Mol Biol Lab, Cambridge CB10 1SD, England","Steinmetz, LM (reprint author), European Mol Biol Lab, Meyerhofstr 1, D-69117 Heidelberg, Germany.",larsms@embl.de,,"Bourgon, Richard/0000-0002-5890-4374; Huber, Wolfgang/0000-0002-0474-2218; Steinmetz, Lars/0000-0002-3962-2865","NHGRI NIH HHS [P01 HG000205, P01 HG000205-19]; NIGMS NIH HHS [R01 GM068717, R01 GM068717-06]",,,49,298,300,2,42,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,24-Jul,2008,454,7203,,,,,479,U1,,10.1038/nature07135,,8,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,329IC,WOS:000257860300043,18615017,No,,,11/20/17

Central to this picture is a putative accretion disk which is believed to be the source of the majority of the radiative output(2-4). It is well known, however, that the most extensively studied disk model(5) - an optically thick disk which is heated locally by the dissipation of gravitational binding energy is apparently contradicted by observations in a few major respects(6,7). In particular, the model predicts a specific blue spectral shape asymptotically from the visible to the near-infrared(5,8), but this is not generally seen in the visible wavelength region where the disk spectrum is observable(9-13). A crucial difficulty has been that, towards the infrared, the disk spectrum starts to be hidden under strong, hot dust emission from much larger but hitherto unresolved scales, and thus has essentially been impossible to observe. Here we report observations of polarized light interior to the dust-emitting region that enable us to uncover this near-infrared disk spectrum in several quasars. The revealed spectra show that the near-infrared disk spectrum is indeed as blue as predicted. This indicates that, at least for the outer near-infrared-emitting radii, the standard picture of the locally heated disk is approximately correct.","[Kishimoto, Makoto] Max Planck Inst Radioastron, D-53121 Bonn, Germany; [Kishimoto, Makoto; Lawrence, Andy] Univ Edinburgh, Royal Observ, Scottish Univ Phys Alliance, Astron Inst, Edinburgh EH9 3HJ, Midlothian, Scotland; [Antonucci, Robert; Blaes, Omer; Leipski, Christian] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Phys, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; [Boisson, Catherine] Univ Paris 07, LUTH, FRE 2462, CNRS,Observ Paris,Sect Meudon, F-92195 Meudon, France; [Albrecht, Marcus] Univ Catolica Norte, Inst Astron, Antofagasta 1270709, Chile","Kishimoto, M (reprint author), Max Planck Inst Radioastron, Hugel 69, D-53121 Bonn, Germany.",mk@mpifr-bonn.mpg.de,,,,,,30,65,65,0,4,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,24-Jul,2008,454,7203,,,,,492,494,,10.1038/nature07114,,3,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,329IC,WOS:000257860300045,18650919,No,,,11/20/17

Organic small-molecule and polymer-based materials represent the most widely explored types of semiconductors for such flexible circuitry(2). Although these materials and those that use films or nanostructures of inorganics have promise for certain applications, existing demonstrations of them in circuits on plastic indicate modest performance characteristics that might restrict the application possibilities. Here we report implementations of a comparatively high-performance carbon-based semiconductor consisting of sub-monolayer, random networks of single-walled carbon nanotubes to yield small-to medium-scale integrated digital circuits, composed of up to nearly 100 transistors on plastic substrates. Transistors in these integrated circuits have excellent properties: mobilities as high as 80 cm(2)V(-1) s(-1), subthreshold slopes as low as 140 m V dec(-1), operating voltages less than 5 V together with deterministic control over the threshold voltages, on/off ratios as high as 10(5), switching speeds in the kilohertz range even for coarse (similar to 100-mu m) device geometries, and good mechanical flexibility - all with levels of uniformity and reproducibility that enable high- yield fabrication of integrated circuits. Theoretical calculations, in contexts ranging from heterogeneous percolative transport through the networks to compact models for the transistors to circuit level simulations, provide quantitative and predictive understanding of these systems. Taken together, these results suggest that sub-monolayer films of single-walled carbon nanotubes are attractive materials for flexible integrated circuits, with many potential areas of application in consumer and other areas of electronics.","[Cao, Qing; Rogers, John A.] Univ Illinois, Dept Chem, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Kim, Hoon-sik; Wang, Congjun; Shim, Moonsub; Rogers, John A.] Univ Illinois, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Rogers, John A.] Univ Illinois, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Rogers, John A.] Univ Illinois, Dept Mech Sci & Engn, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Rogers, John A.] Univ Illinois, Frederick Seitz Mat Res Lab, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Rogers, John A.] Univ Illinois, Beckman Inst Adv Sci & Technol, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Pimparkar, Ninad; Kulkarni, Jaydeep P.; Roy, Kaushik; Alam, Muhammad A.] Purdue Univ, Sch Elect & Comp Engn, Network Computat Nanotechnol, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA","Rogers, JA (reprint author), Univ Illinois, Dept Chem, 1209 W Calif St, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.",jrogers@uiuc.edu,"Shim, Moonsub/A-7875-2009; Wang, Congjun/A-9608-2010; _, __/H-4357-2011; Cao, Qing/E-7420-2012; Rogers, John /L-2798-2016","Shim, Moonsub/0000-0001-7781-1029; ",,,,43,706,717,33,480,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,24-Jul,2008,454,7203,,,,,495,U4,,10.1038/nature07110,,8,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,329IC,WOS:000257860300046,18650920,No,Y,N,11/20/17

Such hetero-epitactic overlayers are currently used in nanotechnology and understanding their growth mechanism is important for the development of new materials and devices. In comparison with crystals, quasicrystalline surfaces exhibit much larger structural and chemical complexity leading, for example, to unusual frictional(2), catalytical(3) or optical properties(4,5). Deposition of thin films on such substrates can lead to structures that may have typical quasicrystalline properties. Recent experiments have indeed showed 5-fold symmetries in the diffraction pattern of metallic layers adsorbed on quasicrystals(6,7). Here we report a real-space investigation of the phase behaviour of a colloidal monolayer interacting with a quasicrystalline decagonal substrate created by interfering five laser beams. We find a pseudomorphic phase that shows both crystalline and quasicrystalline structural properties. It can be described by an archimedean-like tiling(8,9) consisting of alternating rows of square and triangular tiles. The calculated diffraction pattern of this phase is in agreement with recent observations of copper adsorbed on icosahedral Al(70)Pd(21)Mn(9) surfaces(10).

Arsenic is naturally derived from eroded Himalayan sediments, and is believed to enter solution following reductive release from solid phases under anaerobic conditions. However, the processes governing aqueous concentrations and locations of arsenic release to pore water remain unresolved, limiting our ability to predict arsenic concentrations spatially (between wells) and temporally (future concentrations) and to assess the impact of human activities on the arsenic problem(3-9). This uncertainty is partly attributed to a poor understanding of groundwater flow paths altered by extensive irrigation pumping in the Ganges-Brahmaputra delta(10), where most research has focused. Here, using hydrologic and (bio)geochemical measurements, we show that on the minimally disturbed Mekong delta of Cambodia, arsenic is released from near-surface, river-derived sediments and transported, on a centennial timescale, through the underlying aquifer back to the river. Owing to similarities in geologic deposition, aquifer source rock and regional hydrologic gradients(11-15), our results represent a model for understanding pre-disturbance conditions for other major deltas in Asia. Furthermore, the observation of strong hydrologic influence on arsenic behaviour indicates that release and transport of arsenic are sensitive to continuing and impending anthropogenic disturbances. In particular, groundwater pumping for irrigation, changes in agricultural practices, sediment excavation, levee construction and upstream dam installations will alter the hydraulic regime and/or arsenic source material and, by extension, influence groundwater arsenic concentrations and the future of this health problem.","[Polizzotto, Matthew L.; Kocar, Benjamin D.; Fendorf, Scott] Stanford Univ, Sch Earth & Atmospher Sci, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Benner, Shawn G.] Boise State Univ, Dept Geosci, Boise, ID 83705 USA; [Sampson, Michael] Resource Dev Int Cambodia, Phnom Penh, Cambodia","Fendorf, S (reprint author), Stanford Univ, Sch Earth & Atmospher Sci, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",fendorf@stanford.edu,"_, _/B-1010-2010; Benner, Shawn/A-2557-2012","Benner, Shawn/0000-0003-4024-5777",,,,28,258,267,26,237,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,24-Jul,2008,454,7203,,,,,505,U5,,10.1038/nature07093,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,329IC,WOS:000257860300048,18650922,No,Y,N,11/20/17

The mainshock of the 12 May earthquake ruptured with as much as 9m of slip along the boundary between the Longmen Shan and Sichuan basin, and demonstrated the complex strike-slip and thrust motion(6) that characterizes the region(7,8). The Sichuan basin and surroundings are also crossed by other active strike-slip and thrust faults.

We show a remarkably constant leaf temperature of 21.4 +/- 2.2 degrees C across 50 degrees of latitude, from subtropical to boreal biomes. This means that when carbon assimilation is maximal, the physiological and morphological properties of tree branches serve to raise leaf temperature above air temperature to a much greater extent in more northern latitudes. A main assumption underlying the use of delta(18)O to reconstruct climate history is that the temperature and relative humidity of an actively photosynthesizing leaf are the same as those of the surrounding air(3,4). Our data are contrary to that assumption and show that plant physiological ecology must be considered when reconstructing climate through isotope analysis.

The biomass of trematodes was particularly high, being comparable to that of the abundant birds, fishes, burrowing shrimps and polychaetes. Trophically transmitted parasites and parasitic castrators subsumed more biomass than did other parasitic functional groups. The extended phenotype biomass controlled by parasitic castrators sometimes exceeded that of their uninfected hosts.

Bees heterozygous at csd are females, whereas homozygotes and hemizygotes (haploid individuals) are males. Although at least 15 different csd alleles are known among natural bee populations(3), the mechanisms linking allelic interactions to switching of the sexual development programme are still obscure. Here we report a new component of the sex-determining pathway in honeybees, encoded 12 kilobases upstream of csd. The gene feminizer (fem) is the ancestrally conserved progenitor gene from which csd arose and encodes an SR-type protein, harbouring an Arg/Ser-rich domain. Fem shares the same arrangement of Arg/Ser- and proline-rich-domain with the Drosophila principal sex-determining gene transformer (tra), but lacks conserved motifs except for a 30-amino-acid motif that Fem shares only with Tra of another fly, Ceratitis capitata(4). Like tra, the fem transcript is alternatively spliced. The male-specific splice variant contains a premature stop codon and yields no functional product, whereas the female-specific splice variant encodes the functional protein. We show that RNA interference (RNAi)-induced knockdowns of the female-specific fem splice variant result in male bees, indicating that the fem product is required for entire female development. Furthermore, RNAi- induced knockdowns of female allelic csd transcripts result in the male-specific fem splice variant, suggesting that the fem gene implements the switch of developmental pathways controlled by heterozygosity at csd. Comparative analysis of fem and csd coding sequences from five bee species indicates a recent origin of csd in the honeybee lineage from the fem progenitor and provides evidence for positive selection at csd accompanied by purifying selection at fem. The fem locus in bees uncovers gene duplication and positive selection as evolutionary mechanisms underlying the origin of a novel sex determination pathway.","[Hasselmann, Martin; Gempe, Tanja; Schiott, Morten; Otte, Marianne; Beye, Martin] Univ Dusseldorf, Dept Genet, D-40225 Dusseldorf, Germany; [Schiott, Morten] Univ Copenhagen, Ctr Social Evolut, Dept Biol, DK-2100 Copenhagen, Denmark; [Nunes-Silva, Carlos Gustavo] INPA, GPA, BR-69060001 Manaus, Amazonas, Brazil","Beye, M (reprint author), Univ Dusseldorf, Dept Genet, Universitaetsstr 1, D-40225 Dusseldorf, Germany.",martin.beye@uni-duesseldorf.de,"Schiott, Morten/H-4118-2012; Hasselmann, Martin/E-7681-2014; Nunes-Silva, Carlos Gustavo/D-8760-2013","Schiott, Morten/0000-0002-4309-8090; Nunes-Silva, Carlos Gustavo/0000-0003-2276-838X",,,,30,113,119,3,47,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,24-Jul,2008,454,7203,,,,,519,U7,,10.1038/nature07052,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,329IC,WOS:000257860300052,18594516,No,,,11/20/17

Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is an RNA virus that replicates in the liver, and infects 200 million people worldwide(2). Infection is regulated by hepatic immune defences triggered by the cellular RIG-I helicase. RIG-I binds PAMP RNA and signals interferon regulatory factor 3 activation to induce the expression of interferon-alpha/beta and antiviral/interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) that limit infection(3-10). Here we identify the polyuridine motif of the HCV genome 3 ' non-translated region and its replication intermediate as the PAMP substrate of RIG-I, and show that this and similar homopolyuridine or homopolyriboadenine motifs present in the genomes of RNA viruses are the chief feature of RIG-I recognition and immune triggering in human and murine cells(8). 5 ' terminal triphosphate on the PAMP RNA was necessary but not sufficient for RIG-I binding, which was primarily dependent on homopolymeric ribonucleotide composition, linear structure and length. The HCV PAMP RNA stimulated RIG-I-dependent signalling to induce a hepatic innate immune response in vivo, and triggered interferon and ISG expression to suppress HCV infection in vitro. These results provide a conceptual advance by defining specific homopolymeric RNA motifs within the genome of HCV and other RNA viruses as the PAMP substrate of RIG-I, and demonstrate immunogenic features of the PAMP-RIG-I interaction that could be used as an immune adjuvant for vaccine and immunotherapy approaches.","[Saito, Takeshi; Owen, David M.; Gale, Michael, Jr.] Univ Washington, Sch Med, Dept Immunol, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Owen, David M.] Univ Texas Dallas, SW Med Ctr, Dept Microbiol, Dallas, TX 75235 USA; [Jiang, Fuguo; Marcotrigiano, Joseph] Rutgers State Univ, Dept Chem & Chem Biol, Piscataway, NJ 08854 USA","Gale, M (reprint author), Univ Washington, Sch Med, Dept Immunol, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.",mgale@u.washington.edu,"JIANG, FUGUO/G-6581-2012; Saito, Takeshi/N-2788-2014; Marcotrigiano, Joseph /K-6697-2016","JIANG, FUGUO/0000-0003-4469-1803; Saito, Takeshi/0000-0002-6165-664X; Marcotrigiano, Joseph /0000-0003-0346-3353; Owen, David/0000-0002-5724-0342; Gale, Michael/0000-0002-6332-7436","NIAID NIH HHS [R01 AI060389, N01AI40035, R01 AI060389-01, R01 AI060389-02, R01 AI060389-03, R01 AI060389-04, R01 AI060389-05, R01 AI060389-06, R01 AI060389-07, R01 AI060389-08, R01 AI060389-09, R01AI060389, R56 AI060389, U19 AI040035, U19 AI040035-100004, U19 AI040035-110004, U19 AI040035-120004, U19 AI040035-130004, U19 AI040035-140004, U19AI40035]; NIDA NIH HHS [P01 DA021353, R01 DA024563, R01 DA024563-01, R01 DA024563-02, R01 DA024563-03, R01DA021353]",,,30,406,413,0,24,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,24-Jul,2008,454,7203,,,,,523,527,,10.1038/nature07106,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,329IC,WOS:000257860300053,18548002,No,Y,N,11/20/17

Previous work suggests that the regenerative potential of muscle stem cells (satellite cells) is not triggered in the old muscle because of a decline in Notch activation, and that it can be rejuvenated by forced local activation of Notch(3). Here we report that, in addition to the loss of Notch activation, old muscle produces excessive transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta (but not myostatin), which induces unusually high levels of TGF-beta pSmad3 in resident satellite cells and interferes with their regenerative capacity. Importantly, endogenous Notch and pSmad3 antagonize each other in the control of satellite-cell proliferation, such that activation of Notch blocks the TGF-beta-dependent upregulation of the cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitors p15, p16, p21 and p27, whereas inhibition of Notch induces them. Furthermore, in muscle stem cells, Notch activity determines the binding of pSmad3 to the promoters of these negative regulators of cell-cycle progression. Attenuation of TGF-beta/pSmad3 in old, injured muscle restores regeneration to satellite cells in vivo. Thus a balance between endogenous pSmad3 and active Notch controls the regenerative competence of muscle stem cells, and deregulation of this balance in the old muscle microniche interferes with regeneration.","[Carlson, Morgan E.; Hsu, Michael; Conboy, Irina M.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Bioengn, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA","Conboy, IM (reprint author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Bioengn, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",iconboy@berkeley.edu,,"Hsu, Mike/0000-0001-7086-1808","NIA NIH HHS [R01 AG027252, R21 AG27892]",,,30,244,250,4,30,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,24-Jul,2008,454,7203,,,,,528,U9,,10.1038/nature07034,,7,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,329IC,WOS:000257860300054,18552838,No,,,11/20/17

In the Drosophila retina, functional identity of photoreceptors depends on light-sensitive Rhodopsins (Rhs). The much simpler larval eye (Bolwig organ) is composed of about 12 photoreceptors, eight of which are green-sensitive (Rh6) and four bluesensitive (Rh5)(1). The larval eye becomes the adult extraretinal 'eyelet' composed of four green-sensitive (Rh6) photoreceptors(2,3). Here we show that, during metamorphosis, all Rh6 photoreceptors die, whereas the Rh5 photoreceptors switch fate by turning off Rh5 and then turning on Rh6 expression. This switch occurs without apparent changes in the programme of transcription factors that specify larval photoreceptor subtypes. We also show that the transcription factor Senseless (Sens) mediates the very different cellular behaviours of Rh5 and Rh6 photoreceptors. Sens is restricted to Rh5 photoreceptors and must be excluded from Rh6 photoreceptors to allow them to die at metamorphosis. Finally, we show that Ecdysone receptor (EcR) functions autonomously both for the death of larval Rh6 photoreceptors and for the sensory switch of Rh5 photoreceptors to express Rh6. This fate switch of functioning, terminally differentiated neurons provides a novel, unexpected example of hard-wired sensory plasticity.","[Sprecher, Simon G.; Desplan, Claude] NYU, Ctr Dev Genet, Dept Biol, Silver Ctr 1090, New York, NY 10003 USA","Desplan, C (reprint author), NYU, Ctr Dev Genet, Dept Biol, Silver Ctr 1090, 100 Washington Sq E, New York, NY 10003 USA.",cd38@nyu.edu,"Sprecher, Simon/B-5188-2012","Sprecher, Simon/0000-0001-9060-3750","NCRR NIH HHS [C06 RR-15518-01, C06 RR015518]; NEI NIH HHS [EY013010, R01 EY013010, R01 EY013010-01]",,,30,60,61,0,10,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,24-Jul,2008,454,7203,,,,,533,537,,10.1038/nature07062,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,329IC,WOS:000257860300055,18594514,No,,,11/20/17

Recent studies(3) have revealed that the depletion of Ca(2+) from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) triggers the oligomerization of stromal interaction molecule 1 (STIM1), the ER Ca(2+) sensor, and its redistribution to ER-plasma membrane (ER-PM) junctions(4-8) where the CRAC channel subunit ORAI1 accumulates in the plasma membrane and CRAC channels open(9-12). However, how the loss of ER Ca(2+) sets into motion these coordinated molecular rearrangements remains unclear. Here we define the relationships among [Ca(2+)](ER), STIM1 redistribution and CRAC channel activation and identify STIM1 oligomerization as the critical [Ca(2+)](ER)-dependent event that drives store-operated Ca(2+) entry. In human Jurkat leukaemic T cells expressing an ER-targeted Ca(2+) indicator, CRAC channel activation and STIM1 redistribution follow the same function of [Ca(2+)](ER), reaching half-maximum at similar to 200 mu M with a Hill coefficient of similar to 4. Because STIM1 binds only a single Ca(2+) ion(5), the high apparent cooperativity suggests that STIM1 must first oligomerize to enable its accumulation at ER-PM junctions. To assess directly the causal role of STIM1 oligomerization in store-operated Ca(2+) entry, we replaced the luminal Ca(2+)-sensing domain of STIM1 with the 12-kDa FK506- and rapamycin-binding protein (FKBP12, also known as FKBP1A) or the FKBP-rapamycin binding (FRB) domain of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR, also known as FRAP1). A rapamycin analogue oligomerizes the fusion proteins and causes them to accumulate at ER-PM junctions and activate CRAC channels without depleting Ca(2+) from the ER. Thus, STIM1 oligomerization is the critical transduction event through which Ca(2+) store depletion controls store-operated Ca(2+) entry, acting as a switch that triggers the self-organization and activation of STIM1-ORAI1 clusters at ER-PM junctions.","[Luik, Riina M.; Wang, Bin; Prakriya, Murali; Wu, Minnie M.; Lewis, Richard S.] Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Dept Mol & Cellular Physiol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA","Lewis, RS (reprint author), Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Dept Mol & Cellular Physiol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",rslewis@stanford.edu,,,"NIAID NIH HHS [T32 AI007290]; NIGMS NIH HHS [R01 GM045374, R01 GM045374-18]",,,31,260,263,2,27,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,24-Jul,2008,454,7203,,,,,538,U11,,10.1038/nature07065,,7,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,329IC,WOS:000257860300056,18596693,No,Y,N,11/20/17

Detection of chromosome translocations assists in diagnosis, treatment and prognosis of these diseases(1); however, despite their importance to such diseases, the molecular mechanisms leading to chromosome translocations are not well understood. The available evidence indicates a role for non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) in their origin(1-3). Here we develop a yeast-based system that induces a reciprocal chromosome translocation by formation and ligation of breaks on two different chromosomes. We show that interchromosomal end joining is efficiently suppressed by the Tel1- and Mre11-Rad50-Xrs2-dependent pathway; this is distinct from the role of Tel1 in telomeric integrity and from Mec1- and Tel1- dependent checkpoint controls. Suppression of DSB-induced chromosome translocations depends on the kinase activity of Tel1 and Dun1, and the damage-induced phosphorylation of Sae2 and histone H2AX proteins. Tel1- and Sae2-dependent tethering and promotion of 59 to 39 degradation of broken chromosome ends discourage error-prone NHEJ and interchromosomal NHEJ, preserving chromosome integrity on DNA damage. Our results indicate that, like human ATM, Tel1 serves as a key regulator for chromosome integrity in the pathway that reduces the risk for DSB-induced chromosome translocations, and are probably pertinent to the oncogenic chromosome translocations in ATM-deficient cells.","[Lee, Kihoon; Zhang, Yu; Lee, Sang Eun] Univ Texas Hlth Sci Ctr San Antonio, Dept Mol Med, San Antonio, TX 78245 USA; [Lee, Kihoon; Zhang, Yu; Lee, Sang Eun] Univ Texas Hlth Sci Ctr San Antonio, Inst Biotechnol, San Antonio, TX 78245 USA","Lee, SE (reprint author), Univ Texas Hlth Sci Ctr San Antonio, Dept Mol Med, San Antonio, TX 78245 USA.",lees4@uthscsa.edu,,,,,,30,43,43,0,5,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,24-Jul,2008,454,7203,,,,,543,U12,,10.1038/nature07054,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,329IC,WOS:000257860300057,18650924,No,,,11/20/17

Nuclear Cln2 drives coherent regulon expression, whereas cytoplasmic Cln2 drives efficient budding. Cells with the CLN1 and CLN2 genes deleted frequently arrest as unbudded cells, incurring a large fluctuation- induced fitness penalty due to both the lack of cytoplasmic Cln2 and insufficient G1/ S regulon expression. Thus, positive- feedback- amplified expression of Cln1 and Cln2 simultaneously drives robust budding and rapid, coherent regulon expression.

To test this, we used site- specific crosslinking to create chemical connections at the three interfaces between the three constituent polypeptides of the ring, thereby creating covalently closed cohesin rings.

Because Mg II absorption occurs in the haloes of normal galaxies(7-11) along the sightlines to the quasars, this association requires that organized fields of surprisingly high strengths are associated with normal galaxies when the Universe was only about one- third of its present age.","[Bernet, Martin L.; Miniati, Francesco; Lilly, Simon J.] ETH, Dept Phys, CH-8093 Zurich, Switzerland; [Kronberg, Philipp P.] Los Alamos Natl Lab, IGPP, Los Alamos, NM 87545 USA; [Kronberg, Philipp P.] Univ Toronto, Dept Phys, Toronto, ON M5S 1A7, Canada; [Dessauges-Zavadsky, Miroslava] Univ Geneva, Observ Geneva, CH-1290 Sauverny, Switzerland","Miniati, F (reprint author), ETH, Dept Phys, Wolfgang Pauli Str 16, CH-8093 Zurich, Switzerland.",fm@phys.ethz.ch,,,,,,27,157,157,0,6,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,17-Jul,2008,454,7202,,,,,302,304,,10.1038/nature07105,,3,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,326ND,WOS:000257665300031,18633410,No,,,11/20/17

Global mapping showed that phyllosilicates are widespread but are apparently restricted to ancient terrains and a relatively narrow range of mineralogy ( Fe/ Mg and Al smectite clays). This was interpreted to indicate that phyllosilicate formation occurred during the Noachian ( the earliest geological era of Mars), and that the conditions necessary for phyllosilicate formation ( moderate to high pH and high water activity(3)) were specific to surface environments during the earliest era of Mars's history(4). Here we report results from the Compact Reconnaissance Imaging Spectrometer for Mars (CRISM)(5) of phyllosilicate- rich regions. We expand the diversity of phyllosilicate mineralogy with the identification of kaolinite, chlorite and illite or muscovite, and a new class of hydrated silicate ( hydrated silica). We observe diverse Fe/ Mg-OH phyllosilicates and find that smectites such as nontronite and saponite are the most common, but chlorites are also present in some locations. Stratigraphic relationships in the Nili Fossae region show olivine- rich materials overlying phyllosilicate- bearing units, indicating the cessation of aqueous alteration before emplacement of the olivine- bearing unit. Hundreds of detections of Fe/ Mg phyllosilicate in rims, ejecta and central peaks of craters in the southern highland Noachian cratered terrain indicate excavation of altered crust from depth. We also find phyllosilicate in sedimentary deposits clearly laid by water. These results point to a rich diversity of Noachian environments conducive to habitability.","[Mustard, John F.; Pelkey, S.

The spin-1/2 system, with two quantum energy levels, is essentially the most nonlinear system found in nature, whereas the harmonic oscillator represents the most linear, with an infinite number of evenly spaced quantum levels. A significant difference between these systems is that a two- level spin can be prepared in an arbitrary quantum state using classical excitations, whereas classical excitations applied to an oscillator generate a coherent state, nearly indistinguishable from a classical state(2). Quantum behaviour in an oscillator is most obvious in Fock states, which are states with specific numbers of energy quanta, but such states are hard to create(3-7). Here we demonstrate the controlled generation of multi- photon Fock states in a solid- state system. We use a superconducting phase qubit(8), which is a close approximation to a two- level spin system, coupled to a microwave resonator, which acts as a harmonic oscillator, to prepare and analyse pure Fock states with up to six photons. We contrast the Fock states with coherent states generated using classical pulses applied directly to the resonator.","[Hofheinz, Max; Weig, E.

In cavity QED, the observation of the vacuum Rabi mode splitting is used to investigate the nature of matter - light interaction at a quantum-mechanical level. However, this effect can, at least in principle, be explained classically as the normal mode splitting of two coupled linear oscillators(12). It has been suggested that an observation of the scaling of the resonant atom - photon coupling strength in the Jaynes - Cummings energy ladder(13) with the square root of photon number n is sufficient to prove that the system is quantum mechanical in nature(14). Here we report a direct spectroscopic observation of this characteristic quantum nonlinearity. Measuring the photonic degree of freedom of the coupled system, our measurements provide unambiguous spectroscopic evidence for the quantum nature of the resonant atom - field interaction in cavity QED. We explore atom - photon superposition states involving up to two photons, using a spectroscopic pump and probe technique. The experiments have been performed in a circuit QED set- up(15), in which very strong coupling is realized by the large dipole coupling strength and the long coherence time of a superconducting qubit embedded in a high- quality on- chip microwave cavity. Circuit QED systems also provide a natural quantum interface between flying qubits ( photons) and stationary qubits for applications in quantum information processing and communication(16).","[Fink, J.

The invention of the scanning tunnelling microscope(1) revolutionized experimental surface science in that atomic- scale features on a solid- state surface could finally be readily imaged. However, scanning tunnelling microscopy has limited applicability due to restrictions in, for example, sample conductivity, cleanliness, and data acquisition rate. An older microscopy technique, that of transmission electron microscopy (TEM)(2,3), has benefited tremendously in recent years from subtle instrumentation advances, and individual heavy ( high-atomic-number) atoms can now be detected by TEM(4-7) even when embedded within a semiconductor material(8,9). But detecting an individual low- atomic- number atom, for example carbon or even hydrogen, is still extremely challenging, if not impossible, via conventional TEM owing to the very low contrast of light elements(2,3,10) (-12). Here we demonstrate a means to observe, by conventional TEM, even the smallest atoms and molecules: on a clean single- layer graphene membrane, adsorbates such as atomic hydrogen and carbon can be seen as if they were suspended in free space. We directly image such individual adatoms, along with carbon chains and vacancies, and investigate their dynamics in real time. These techniques open a way to reveal dynamics of more complex chemical reactions or identify the atomic- scale structure of unknown adsorbates. In addition, the study of atomic- scale defects in graphene may provide insights for nanoelectronic applications of this interesting material.","[Meyer, Jannik C.; Girit, C. O.; Crommie, M.

OAE2, occurring at the Cenomanian/ Turonian boundary ( about 93.5 Myr ago)(3), is the most widespread and best defined OAE of the mid-Cretaceous. Although the enhanced burial of organic matter can be explained either through increased primary productivity or enhanced preservation scenarios(1,2), the actual trigger mechanism, corresponding closely to the onset of these episodes of increased carbon sequestration, has not been clearly identified. It has been postulated that large- scale magmatic activity initially triggered OAE2 ( refs 4, 5), but a direct proxy of magmatism preserved in the sedimentary record coinciding closely with the onset of OAE2 has not yet been found. Here we report seawater osmium isotope ratios in organic- rich sediments from two distant sites. We find that at both study sites the marine osmium isotope record changes abruptly just at or before the onset of OAE2. Using a simple two-component mixing equation, we calculate that over 97 per cent of the total osmium content in contemporaneous seawater at both sites is magmatic in origin, a similar to 30-50-fold increase relative to pre-OAE conditions. Furthermore, the magmatic osmium isotope signal appears slightly before the OAE2 - as indicated by carbon isotope ratios - suggesting a time- lag of up to similar to 23 kyr between magmatism and the onset of significant organic carbon burial, which may reflect the reaction time of the global ocean system. Our marine osmium isotope data are indicative of a widespread magmatic pulse at the onset of OAE2, which may have triggered the subsequent deposition of large amounts of organic matter.","[Turgeon, Steven C.; Creaser, Robert A.] Univ Alberta, Dept Earth & Atmospher Sci, Edmonton, AB T2G 2E2, Canada","Turgeon, SC (reprint author), Univ Alberta, Dept Earth & Atmospher Sci, Edmonton, AB T2G 2E2, Canada.",turgeonsc@ualberta.ca,,"Creaser, Robert/0000-0002-7672-035X",,,,30,160,169,2,45,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,17-Jul,2008,454,7202,,,,,323,U29,,10.1038/nature07076,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,326ND,WOS:000257665300036,18633415,No,,,11/20/17

A question remains as to why symbiotic N(2)- fixing plants are more abundant in vast areas of the tropics than in many of the mature forests that seem to be nitrogen- limited in the temperate and boreal zones(3). Here we present a unifying framework for terrestrial N(2) fixation that can explain the geographic occurrence of N(2) fixers across diverse biomes and at the global scale. By examining trade- offs inherent in plant carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus capture, we find a clear advantage to symbiotic N(2) fixers in phosphorus-limited tropical savannas and lowland tropical forests. The ability of N(2) fixers to invest nitrogen into phosphorus acquisition seems vital to sustained N(2) fixation in phosphorus- limited tropical ecosystems. In contrast, modern- day temperatures seem to constrain N(2) fixation rates and N(2)- fixing species from mature forests in the high latitudes. We propose that an analysis that couples biogeochemical cycling and biophysical mechanisms is sufficient to explain the principal geographical patterns of symbiotic N(2) fixation on land, thus providing a basis for predicting the response of nutrient- limited ecosystems to climate change and increasing atmospheric CO(2).","[Houlton, Benjamin Z.; Vitousek, Peter M.] Stanford Univ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Houlton, Benjamin Z.; Field, Christopher B.] Carnegie Inst Washington, Dept Global Ecol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Wang, Ying-Ping] CSIRO Marine & Atmospher Res, Aspendale, Vic 3195, Australia; [Wang, Ying-Ping] Ctr Australian Weather & Climate Res, Aspendale, Vic 3195, Australia","Houlton, BZ (reprint author), Univ Calif Davis, Dept Land Air & Water Resources, Davis, CA 95616 USA.",bzhoulton@ucdavis.edu,"wang, yp/A-9765-2011","wang, yp/0000-0002-4614-6203; Houlton, Benjamin/0000-0002-1414-0261",,,,41,266,277,23,220,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,17-Jul,2008,454,7202,,,,,327,U34,,10.1038/nature07028,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,326ND,WOS:000257665300037,18563086,No,Y,N,11/20/17

Community- level responses to disturbance can be arrayed along a spectrum ranging from synchronous oscillations where all species rise and fall together, to compensatory dynamics where total biomass remains relatively constant despite fluctuations in the densities of individual species(1). An important recent insight is that patterns of synchrony and compensation can vary with the timescale of analysis(2) and that spectral time series methods can enable detection of coherent dynamics that would otherwise be obscured by opposing patterns occurring at different scales(3). Here I show that application of wavelet analysis to experimentally manipulated plankton communities reveals strong synchrony after disturbance. The result is paradoxical because it is well established that these communities contain both disturbance- sensitive and disturbance- tolerant species leading to compensation within functional groups(4,5). Theory predicts that compensatory substitution of functionally equivalent species should stabilize ecological communities(6-10), yet I found at the whole- community level a large increase in seasonal biomass variation. Resolution of the paradox hinges on patterns of seasonality among species. The compensatory shift in community composition after disturbance resulted in a loss of cold- season dominants, which before disturbance had served to stabilize biomass throughout the year. Species dominating the disturbed community peaked coherently during the warm season, explaining the observed synchrony and increase in seasonal biomass variation. These results suggest that theory relating compensatory dynamics to ecological stability needs to consider not only complementarity in species responses to environmental change, but also seasonal complementarity among disturbance- tolerant and disturbance- sensitive species.","Univ Texas Austin, Austin, TX 78712 USA","Keitt, TH (reprint author), Univ Texas Austin, Austin, TX 78712 USA.",tkeitt@mail.utexas.edu,,,,,,29,40,41,2,38,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,17-Jul,2008,454,7202,,,,,331,U39,,10.1038/nature06935,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,326ND,WOS:000257665300038,18633416,No,,,11/20/17

Here we present evidence that in all of these species a similar 'clock-and-wavefront'(1-3) mechanism operates to control somitogenesis; in all of them, somitogenesis is brought to an end through a process in which the presomitic mesoderm, having first increased in size, gradually shrinks until it is exhausted, terminating somite formation.

Humans and other animals will work, often quite hard, for these cues. This is termed conditioned reinforcement. The ability to use conditioned reinforcers to guide our behaviour is normally beneficial; however, it can go awry. For example, corporate icons, such as McDonald's Golden Arches, influence consumer behaviour in powerful and sometimes surprising ways(1), and drug- associated cues trigger relapse to drug seeking in addicts and animals exposed to addictive drugs, even after abstinence or extinction(2,3). Yet, despite their prevalence, it is not known how conditioned reinforcers control human or other animal behaviour. One possibility is that they act through the use of the specific rewards they predict; alternatively, they could control behaviour directly by activating emotions that are independent of any specific reward. In other words, the Golden Arches may drive business because they evoke thoughts of hamburgers and fries, or instead, may be effective because they also evoke feelings of hunger or happiness. Moreover, different brain circuits could support conditioned reinforcement mediated by thoughts of specific outcomes versus more general affective information. Here we have attempted to address these questions in rats. Rats were trained to learn that different cues predicted different rewards using specialized conditioning procedures that controlled whether the cues evoked thoughts of specific outcomes or general affective representations common to different outcomes.

Although some of the actions of IGFBPs have been reported to be independent of IGFs, the precise mechanisms of IGF- independent actions of IGFBPs are largely unknown(1,2). Here we report a previously unknown function for IGFBP- 4 as a cardiogenic growth factor. IGFBP- 4 enhanced cardiomyocyte differentiation in vitro, and knockdown of Igfbp4 attenuated cardiomyogenesis both in vitro and in vivo. The cardiogenic effect of IGFBP- 4 was independent of its IGF- binding activity but was mediated by the inhibitory effect on canonical Wnt signalling. IGFBP- 4 physically interacted with a Wnt receptor, Frizzled 8 ( Frz8), and a Wnt co- receptor, low-density lipoprotein receptor- related protein 6 ( LRP6), and inhibited the binding of Wnt3A to Frz8 and LRP6. Although IGF- independent, the cardiogenic effect of IGFBP- 4 was attenuated by IGFs through IGFBP- 4 sequestration. IGFBP- 4 is therefore an inhibitor of the canonical Wnt signalling required for cardiogenesis and provides a molecular link between IGF signalling and Wnt signalling.","[Zhu, Weidong; Shiojima, Ichiro; Li, Zhi; Ikeda, Hiroyuki; Yoshida, Masashi; Naito, Atsuhiko T.; Nishi, Jun-ichiro; Minamino, Tohru; Nagai, Toshio; Komuro, Issei] Chiba Univ, Grad Sch Med, Dept Cardiovasc Sci & Med, Chiba 2608670, Japan; [Ito, Yuzuru; Asashima, Makoto] Japan Sci & Technol Agcy, ICORP Organ Regenerat Project, Tokyo 1538902, Japan; [Ueno, Hiroo] Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Inst Stem Cell Biol & Regenerat Med, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Umezawa, Akihiro] Natl Inst Child Hlth & Dev, Dept Reprod Biol, Tokyo 1578535, Japan; [Kikuchi, Akira] Hiroshima Univ, Dept Biochem, Grad Sch Biomed Sci, Hiroshima 7348551, Japan; [Asashima, Makoto] Univ Tokyo, Dept Life Sci Biol, Grad Sch Arts & Sci, Tokyo 1538902, Japan; [Asashima, Makoto] Natl Inst Adv Ind Sci & Technol, Tsukuba 3058562, Japan","Komuro, I (reprint author), Chiba Univ, Grad Sch Med, Dept Cardiovasc Sci & Med, Chiba 2608670, Japan.",komuro-tky@umin.ac.jp,,"Minamino, Tohru/0000-0003-1627-6151",,,,30,126,135,0,13,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,17-Jul,2008,454,7202,,,,,345,U51,,10.1038/nature07027,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,326ND,WOS:000257665300041,18528331,No,,,11/20/17

T(H)17 and nT(reg) cells have been implicated in the pathogenesis of human autoimmune diseases, including multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease and psoriasis(1,2). Our recent data and the work of others demonstrated that transforming growth factor-beta ( TGF-beta) and IL- 6 are responsible for the differentiation of naive mouse T cells into T(H)17 cells, and it has been proposed that IL-23 may have a critical role in stabilization of the T(H)17 phenotype(3-5). A second pathway has been discovered in which a combination of TGF-beta and IL- 21 is capable of inducing differentiation of mouse T(H)17 cells in the absence of IL- 6 ( refs 6 - 8). However, TGF-beta and IL- 6 are not capable of differentiating human T(H)17 cells(2,9) and it has been suggested that TGF-beta may in fact suppress the generation of human T(H)17 cells(10). Instead, it has been recently shown that the cytokines IL-1 beta, IL- 6 and IL- 23 are capable of driving IL- 17 secretion in short- term CD4(+) T cell lines isolated from human peripheral blood(11), although the factors required for differentiation of naive human CD4 to T(H)17 cells are still unknown. Here we confirm that whereas IL-1 beta and IL- 6 induce IL- 17A secretion from human central memory CD4(+) T cells, TGF-beta and IL- 21 uniquely promote the differentiation of human naive CD4(+) T cells into T(H)17 cells accompanied by expression of the transcription factor RORC2.

The regulatory mechanisms that generate this switch- like behaviour are unclear. Anaphase is initiated when a ubiquitin ligase, the anaphase- promoting complex ( APC), triggers the destruction of securin, thereby allowing separase, a protease, to disrupt sister- chromatid cohesion(1-4). Here we demonstrate that the cyclin- dependent kinase 1 ( Cdk1)- dependent phosphorylation of securin near its destruction- box motif inhibits securin ubiquitination by the APC. The phosphatase Cdc14 reverses securin phosphorylation, thereby increasing the rate of securin ubiquitination. Because separase is known to activate Cdc14 ( refs 5 and 6), our results support the existence of a positive feedback loop that increases the abruptness of anaphase. Consistent with this model, we show that mutations that disrupt securin phosphoregulation decrease the synchrony of chromosome segregation. Our results also suggest that coupling securin degradation with changes in Cdk1 and Cdc14 activities helps coordinate the initiation of sister- chromatid separation with changes in spindle dynamics.","[Holt, Liam J.; Morgan, David O.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Physiol, San Francisco, CA 94158 USA; [Holt, Liam J.; Morgan, David O.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Biochem, San Francisco, CA 94158 USA; [Holt, Liam J.; Morgan, David O.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Biophys, San Francisco, CA 94158 USA; [Krutchinsky, Andrew N.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Pharmaceut Chem, San Francisco, CA 94158 USA","Morgan, DO (reprint author), Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Physiol, San Francisco, CA 94158 USA.",david.morgan@ucsf.edu,,"Holt, Liam/0000-0002-4002-0861","NIGMS NIH HHS [R01 GM069901-05, R01 GM069901]",,,30,122,124,0,13,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,17-Jul,2008,454,7202,,,,,353,357,,10.1038/nature07050,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,326ND,WOS:000257665300043,18552837,No,,,11/20/17

However, the evolution of protein synthesis in the RNA world required RNAs capable of catalysing this reaction. Ribozymes that aminoacylate RNA by using activated amino acids have been discovered through selection in vitro(1-5). Flexizyme is a 45- nucleotide ribozyme capable of charging tRNA in trans with various activated L- phenylalanine derivatives. In addition to a more than 10(5) rate enhancement and more than 10(4)-fold discrimination against some non- cognate amino acids, this ribozyme achieves good regioselectivity: of all the hydroxyl groups of a tRNA, it exclusively aminoacylates the terminal 3'-OH(5-7). Here we report the 2.8-angstrom resolution structure of flexizyme fused to a substrate RNA. Together with randomization of ribozyme core residues and reselection, this structure shows that very few nucleotides are needed for the aminoacylation of specific tRNAs. Although it primarily recognizes tRNA through base- pairing with the CCA terminus of the tRNA molecule, flexizyme makes numerous local interactions to position the acceptor end of tRNA precisely. A comparison of two crystallographically independent flexizyme conformations, only one of which appears capable of binding activated phenylalanine, suggests that this ribozyme may achieve enhanced specificity by coupling active- site folding to tRNA docking. Such a mechanism would be reminiscent of the mutually induced fit of tRNA and protein employed by some aminoacyl- tRNA synthetases(8,9) to increase specificity.","[Xiao, Hong; Ferre-D'Amare, Adrian R.] Fred Hutchinson Canc Res Ctr, Div Basic Sci, Seattle, WA 98109 USA; [Murakami, Hiroshi; Suga, Hiroaki] Univ Tokyo, Adv Sci & Technol Res Ctr, Tokyo 1538904, Japan; [Suga, Hiroaki] Univ Tokyo, Dept Chem & Biotechnol, Grad Sch Engn, Tokyo 1138656, Japan","Ferre-D'Amare, AR (reprint author), Fred Hutchinson Canc Res Ctr, Div Basic Sci, 1100 Fairview Ave N, Seattle, WA 98109 USA.",aferre@fhcrc.org,,,,,,36,69,70,0,19,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,17-Jul,2008,454,7202,,,,,358,U60,,10.1038/nature07033,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,326ND,WOS:000257665300044,18548004,No,,,11/20/17

Three GP1 viral attachment subunits assemble to form a chalice, cradled by the GP2 fusion subunits, while a novel glycan cap and projected mucin- like domain restrict access to the conserved receptor- binding site sequestered in the chalice bowl. The glycocalyx surrounding GP is likely central to immune evasion and may explain why survivors have insignificant neutralizing antibody titres.

About 15 per cent of near- Earth and main- belt asteroids with diameters under 10 km have satellites(1,2). The mechanism that forms such similar binaries in these two dynamically different populations was hitherto unclear. Here we show that these binaries are created by the slow spinup of a `rubble pile' asteroid by means of the thermal YORP ( Yarkovsky - O'Keefe - Radzievskii - Paddack) effect. We find that mass shed from the equator of a critically spinning body accretes into a satellite if the material is collisionally dissipative and the primary maintains a low equatorial elongation. The satellite forms mostly from material originating near the primary's surface and enters into a close, low- eccentricity orbit.

The minimization of absorption seen in the Borrmann effect has been explained by noting that the electric field of the X- ray beam approaches zero amplitude at the crystal planes, thus avoiding the atoms. Here we show experimentally that under conditions of absorption suppression, the weaker electric quadrupole absorption transitions are effectively enhanced to such a degree that they can dominate the absorption spectrum. This effect can be exploited as an atomic spectroscopy technique; we show that quadrupole transitions give rise to additional structure at the L(1), L(2) and L(3) absorption edges of gadolinium in gadolinium gallium garnet, which mark the onset of excitations from 2s, 2p(1/2) and 2p(3/2) atomic core levels, respectively. Although the Borrmann effect served to underpin the development of the theory of X- ray diffraction(3-6), this is potentially the most important experimental application of the phenomenon since its first observation seven decades ago. Identifying quadrupole features in X- ray absorption spectroscopy is central to the interpretation of 'pre- edge' spectra, which are often taken to be indicators of local symmetry, valence and atomic environment(7). Quadrupolar absorption isolates states of different symmetries to that of the dominant dipole spectrum, and typically reveals orbitals that dominate the electronic ground- state properties of lanthanides and 3d transition metals, including magnetism. Results from our Borrmann spectroscopy technique feed into contemporary discussions regarding resonant X- ray diffraction(8) and the nature of pre-edge lines identified by inelastic X- ray scattering(7). Furthermore, because the Borrmann effect has been observed in photonic materials, it seems likely that the quadrupole enhancement reported here will play an important role in modern optics.","[Collins, Stephen P.] Diamond Light Source Ltd, Didcot O11 0DE, Oxon, England; [Pettifer, Robert F.; Collins, Stephen P.] Univ Warwick, Dept Phys, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England; [Laundy, David] STFC Daresbury Lab, Warrington WA4 4AD, Cheshire, England","Collins, SP (reprint author), Diamond Light Source Ltd, Diamond House,Harwell Sci & Innovat Campus, Didcot O11 0DE, Oxon, England.",steve.collins@diamond.ac.uk,,,,,,30,19,20,1,21,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,10-Jul,2008,454,7201,,,,,196,199,,10.1038/nature07099,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,323RU,WOS:000257466900039,18615080,No,,,11/20/17

Recent quantum oscillation experiments on high- transition- temperature ( high- T-c) copper oxide superconductors(7-10) have revealed the existence of a Fermi surface akin to that in normal metals, comprising fermionic carriers that undergo orbital quantization(11). The unexpectedly small size of the observed carrier pocket, however, leaves open a variety of possibilities for the existence or form of any underlying magnetic order, and its relation to d- wave superconductivity(12-15). Here we report experiments on quantum oscillations in the magnetization ( the de Haas- van Alphen effect) in superconducting YBa2Cu3O6.51 that reveal more than one carrier pocket. In particular, we find evidence for the existence of a much larger pocket of heavier mass carriers playing a thermodynamically dominant role in this hole- doped superconductor. Importantly, characteristics of the multiple pockets within this more complete Fermi surface impose constraints on the wavevector of any underlying order and the location of the carriers in momentum space.

Here we show that stress changes are indeed measurable using this technique. Over a two- month period, we observed an excellent anti-correlation between changes in the time required for a shear wave to travel through the rock along a fixed pathway ( a few microseconds) and variations in barometric pressure. We also observed two large excursions in the travel- time data that are coincident with two earthquakes that are among those predicted to produce the largest coseismic stress changes at SAFOD. The two excursions started approximately 10 and 2 hours before the events, respectively, suggesting that they may be related to pre- rupture stress induced changes in crack properties, as observed in early laboratory studies(1,2).","[Niu, Fenglin; Cheng, Xin] Rice Univ, Dept Earth Sci, Houston, TX 77005 USA; [Silver, Paul G.] Carnegie Inst Sci, Dept Terr Magnetism, Washington, DC 20015 USA; [Daley, Thomas M.; Majer, Ernest L.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Lawrence Berkeley Lab, Div Earth Sci, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA","Niu, FL (reprint author), Rice Univ, Dept Earth Sci, MS-126,6100 Main St, Houston, TX 77005 USA.",niu@rice.edu,"Niu, Fenglin/A-2548-2011; Cheng, Xin/C-2973-2011; Daley, Thomas/G-3274-2015","Daley, Thomas/0000-0001-9445-0843",,,,20,75,107,1,19,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,10-Jul,2008,454,7201,,,,,204,U44,,10.1038/nature07111,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,323RU,WOS:000257466900041,18615082,No,,,11/20/17

This arrangement, one of the most extraordinary anatomical specializations among vertebrates, arises through migration of one eye during late larval development. Although the transformation of symmetrical larvae into asymmetrical juveniles is well documented(1-7), the evolutionary origins of flatfish asymmetry are uncertain(1,2) because there are no transitional forms linking flatfishes with their symmetrical relatives(8,9). The supposed inviability of such intermediates gave pleuronectiforms a prominent role in evolutionary debates(10-16), leading to attacks on natural selection(11) and arguments for saltatory change(14,15). Here I show that Amphistium and the new genus Heteronectes, both extinct spiny- finned fishes from the Eocene epoch of Europe, are the most primitive pleuronectiforms known. The orbital region of the skull in both taxa is strongly asymmetrical, as in living flatfishes, but these genera retain many primitive characters unknown in extant forms. Most remarkably, orbital migration was incomplete in Amphistium and Heteronectes, with eyes remaining on opposite sides of the head in post- metamorphic individuals. This condition is intermediate between that in living pleuronectiforms and the arrangement found in other fishes. Amphistium and Heteronectes indicate that the evolution of the profound cranial asymmetry of extant flatfishes was gradual in nature.","[Friedman, Matt] Univ Chicago, Comm Evolutionary Biol, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Friedman, Matt] Field Museum Nat Hist, Dept Geol, Chicago, IL 60605 USA","Friedman, M (reprint author), Univ Chicago, Comm Evolutionary Biol, 1025 E 57th St, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.",mattf@uchicago.edu,"Friedman, Matt/F-6991-2012",,,,,30,59,64,17,101,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,10-Jul,2008,454,7201,,,,,209,212,,10.1038/nature07108,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,323RU,WOS:000257466900042,18615083,No,,,11/20/17

However, evolutionary game theory predicts(4,6) that the temptation to forgo the public good mostly wins over collective cooperative action, and this is often also seen in economic experiments(7). Here we show how social diversity provides an escape from this apparent paradox. Up to now, individuals have been treated as equivalent in all respects(4,8), in sharp contrast with real- life situations, where diversity is ubiquitous. We introduce social diversity by means of heterogeneous graphs and show that cooperation is promoted by the diversity associated with the number and size of the public goods game in which each individual participates and with the individual contribution to each such game. When social ties follow a scale- free distribution(9), cooperation is enhanced whenever all individuals are expected to contribute a fixed amount irrespective of the plethora of public goods games in which they engage. Our results may help to explain the emergence of cooperation in the absence of mechanisms based on individual reputation and punishment(10-12). Combining social diversity with reputation and punishment will provide instrumental clues on the self- organization of social communities and their economical implications.","[Santos, Marta D.; Pacheco, Jorge M.] Univ Lisbon, CFTC, ATP Grp, P-1649003 Lisbon, Portugal; [Santos, Francisco C.] Univ Libre Brussels, Comp & Decis Engn Dept, IRIDIA, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium; [Santos, Marta D.; Pacheco, Jorge M.] Univ Lisbon, Dept Fis, P-1649003 Lisbon, Portugal","Pacheco, JM (reprint author), Univ Lisbon, CFTC, ATP Grp, Complexo Interdisciplinar,Av Prof Gama Pinto 2, P-1649003 Lisbon, Portugal.",pacheco@cii.fc.ul.pt,"Pacheco, Jorge/B-6116-2008; Santos, Marta/C-9573-2011; Santos, Francisco/D-2394-2010; Santos, Marta/N-4772-2015","Pacheco, Jorge/0000-0002-2579-8499; Santos, Marta/0000-0003-1824-0080; Santos, Francisco/0000-0002-9103-2862; ",,,,30,533,539,31,222,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,10-Jul,2008,454,7201,,,,,213,U49,,10.1038/nature06940,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,323RU,WOS:000257466900043,18615084,No,Y,N,11/20/17

Animals move to environments of optimal temperature and some manipulate the temperature of their surroundings, as humans do using clothing and shelter. Despite the ubiquitous influence of environmental temperature on animal behaviour, the neural circuits and strategies through which animals select a preferred temperature remain largely unknown. Here we identify a small set of warmth- activated anterior cell ( AC) neurons located in the Drosophila brain, the function of which is critical for preferred temperature selection. AC neuron activation occurs just above the fly's preferred temperature and depends on dTrpA1, an ion channel that functions as amolecular sensor of warmth. Flies that selectively express dTrpA1 in the AC neurons select normal temperatures, whereas flies in which dTrpA1 function is reduced or eliminated choose warmer temperatures. This internal warmth- sensing pathway promotes avoidance of slightly elevated temperatures and acts together with a distinct pathway for cold avoidance to set the fly's preferred temperature. Thus, flies select a preferred temperature by using a thermal sensing pathway tuned to trigger avoidance of temperatures that deviate even slightly from the preferred temperature. This provides a potentially general strategy for robustly selecting a narrow temperature range optimal for survival.","[Hamada, Fumika N.; Rosenzweig, Mark; Kang, Kyeongjin; Pulver, Stefan R.; Ghezzi, Alfredo; Garrity, Paul A.] Brandeis Univ, Dept Biol, Volen Ctr Complex Syst, Natl Ctr Behav Genom, Waltham, MA 02454 USA; [Jegla, Timothy J.] Scripps Res Inst, Dept Cell Biol, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; [Jegla, Timothy J.] Scripps Res Inst, Inst Childhood & Neglected Dis, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA","Garrity, PA (reprint author), Brandeis Univ, Dept Biol, Volen Ctr Complex Syst, Natl Ctr Behav Genom, MS-008,415 South St, Waltham, MA 02454 USA.",pgarrity@brandeis.edu,"Ghezzi, Alfredo/I-4620-2012","Ghezzi, Alfredo/0000-0001-9176-1320; Kang, KyeongJin/0000-0003-0446-469X","NCRR NIH HHS [RR16780]; NEI NIH HHS [R01 EY013874, R01 EY013874-06, R01 EY13874]; NIMH NIH HHS [R01 MH067284, R01 MH067284-05]; NINDS NIH HHS [P01 NS044232, P01 NS044232-060002, P01 NS044232-070002, P30 NS045713, P30 NS045713-069006, P30 NS045713S10]",,,28,394,396,13,84,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,10-Jul,2008,454,7201,,,,,217,U55,,10.1038/nature07001,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,323RU,WOS:000257466900044,18548007,No,Y,N,11/20/17

Increased osteoclast activity causes osteoporosis, a disorder resulting in a low bone mass and a high risk of fractures(1). Increased osteoclast size and numbers are also a hallmark of other disorders, such as Paget's disease and multiple myeloma(2). The protein c- Fos, a component of the AP- 1 transcription factor complex, is essential for osteoclast differentiation(3). Here we show that the Fos- related protein Fra- 2 controls osteoclast survival and size. The bones of Fra- 2- deficient newborn mice have giant osteoclasts, and signalling through leukaemia inhibitory factor ( LIF) and its receptor is impaired. Similarly, newborn animals lacking LIF have giant osteoclasts, and we show that LIF is a direct transcriptional target of Fra- 2 and c- Jun. Moreover, bones deficient in Fra- 2 and LIF are hypoxic and express increased levels of hypoxia- induced factor 1 alpha ( HIF1 alpha) and Bcl- 2. Overexpression of Bcl- 2 is sufficient to induce giant osteoclasts in vivo, whereas Fra- 2 and LIF affect HIF1a through transcriptional modulation of the HIF prolyl hydroxylase PHD2. This pathway is operative in the placenta, because specific inactivation of Fra- 2 in the embryo alone does not cause hypoxia or the giant osteoclast phenotype. Thus placenta- induced hypoxia during embryogenesis leads to the formation of giant osteoclasts in young pups. These findings offer potential targets for the treatment of syndromes associated with increased osteoclastogenesis.","[Bozec, Aline; Bakiri, Latifa; Hoebertz, Astrid; Eferl, Robert; Komnenovic, Vukoslav; Scheuch, Harald; Wagner, Erwin F.] Res Inst Mol Pathol, A-1030 Vienna, Austria; [Schilling, Arndt F.; Priemel, Matthias; Amling, Michael] Univ Med Ctr Hamburg Eppendorf, Dept Trauma Hand & Reconstruct Surg, Ctr Biomech & Skeletal Biol, D-20246 Hamburg, Germany; [Stewart, Colin L.] Inst Med Biol, Dev & Regenerat Biol Lab, Singapore 138648, Singapore","Wagner, EF (reprint author), CNIO, C Melchor Fernandez Almagro 3, E-28029 Madrid, Spain.",wagner@imp.ac.at,"Bakiri, Latifa/N-5780-2014; Wagner, Erwin/G-9637-2012","Wagner, Erwin/0000-0001-7872-0196; Eferl, Robert/0000-0002-6074-7144",,,,34,107,112,0,20,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,10-Jul,2008,454,7201,,,,,221,U61,,10.1038/nature07019,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,323RU,WOS:000257466900045,18548006,No,,,11/20/17

Multiple myeloma, a malignancy of plasma cells, has a complex molecular aetiology with several subgroups defined by gene expression profiling and recurrent chromosomal translocations(4,5). Moreover, the malignant clone can sustain multiple oncogenic lesions, accumulating genetic damage as the disease progresses(6,7). Current therapies for myeloma can extend survival but are not curative(8,9). Hence, new therapeutic strategies are needed that target molecular pathways shared by all subtypes of myeloma. Here we show, using a loss- of- function, RNA- interference- based genetic screen, that IRF4 inhibition is toxic to myeloma cell lines, regardless of transforming oncogenic mechanism. Gene expression profiling and genome- wide chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis uncovered an extensive network of IRF4 target genes and identified MYC as a direct target of IRF4 in activated B cells and myeloma. Unexpectedly, IRF4 was itself a direct target of MYC transactivation, generating an autoregulatory circuit in myeloma cells. Although IRF4 is not genetically altered in most myelomas, they are nonetheless addicted to an aberrant IRF4 regulatory network that fuses the gene expression programmes of normal plasma cells and activated B cells.","[Shaffer, Arthur L.; Emre, N.

Nix(-/-) mice developed anaemia with reduced mature erythrocytes and compensatory expansion of erythroid precursors. Erythrocytes in the peripheral blood of Nix(-/-) mice exhibited mitochondrial retention and reduced lifespan in vivo. Although the clearance of ribosomes proceeded normally in the absence of Nix, the entry of mitochondria into autophagosomes for clearance was defective. Deficiency in Nix inhibited the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (Delta Psi(m)), and treatment with uncoupling chemicals or a BH3 mimetic induced the loss of Delta Psi(m) and restored the sequestration of mitochondria into autophagosomes in Nix(-/-) erythroid cells. These results suggest that Nix- dependent loss of Delta Psi(m) is important for targeting the mitochondria into autophagosomes for clearance during erythroid maturation, and interference with this function impairs erythroid maturation and results in anaemia.

Thus, some assembly properties, such as kinetics and location, are either unknown or controversial(2-5). Here we describe quantitatively the genesis of individual virions in real time, from initiation of assembly to budding and release. We studied fluorescently tagged derivatives of Gag, the major structural component of HIV-1-which is sufficient to drive the assembly of virus- like particles(6) - with the use of fluorescence resonance energy transfer, fluorescence recovery after photobleaching and total- internal- reflection fluorescent microscopy in living cells. Virions appeared individually at the plasma membrane, their assembly rate accelerated as Gag protein accumulated in cells, and typically 5 - 6 min was required to complete the assembly of a single virion.

In both cell types, one daughter cell self- renews continuously while the other undergoes a limited number of divisions, stops to proliferate mitotically and differentiates. Whereas neuroblasts segregate the Trim - NHL( tripartite motif and Ncl- 1, HT2A and Lin- 41 domain)- containing protein Brain tumour ( Brat) into one of the two daughter cells(4-6), ovarian stem cells are regulated by an extracellular signal from the surrounding stem cell niche. After division, one daughter cell looses niche contact. It undergoes 4 transit- amplifying divisions to form a cyst of 16 interconnected cells that reduce their rate of growth and stop to proliferate mitotically. Here we show that the Trim - NHL protein Mei- P26 ( refs 7, 8) restricts growth and proliferation in the ovarian stem cell lineage. Mei- P26 expression is low in stem cells but is strongly induced in 16- cell cysts. In mei- P26 mutants, transit-amplifying cells are larger and proliferate indefinitely leading to the formation of an ovarian tumour. Like brat, mei- P26 regulates nucleolar size and can induce differentiation in Drosophila neuroblasts, suggesting that these genes act through the same pathway. We identify Argonaute- 1, a component of the RISC complex, as a common binding partner of Brat and Mei- P26, and show that Mei- P26 acts by inhibiting the microRNA pathway. Mei- P26 and Brat have a similar domain composition that is also found in other tumour suppressors and might be a defining property of a new family of microRNA regulators that act specifically in stem cell lineages.","[Neumueller, Ralph A.; Betschinger, Joerg; Fischer, Anja; Poernbacher, Ingrid; Mechtler, Karl; Knoblich, Juergen A.] Austrian Acad Sci, Inst Mol Biotechnol, A-1030 Vienna, Austria; [Bushati, Natascha; Cohen, Stephen M.] European Mol Biol Lab, D-69117 Heidelberg, Germany; [Mechtler, Karl] Res Inst Mol Pathol, A-1030 Vienna, Austria","Knoblich, JA (reprint author), Austrian Acad Sci, Inst Mol Biotechnol, Dr Bohr Gasse 3, A-1030 Vienna, Austria.",juergen.knoblich@imba.oeaw.ac.at,"Cohen, Stephen/G-9930-2011; Knoblich, Juergen/C-2974-2015","Cohen, Stephen/0000-0003-2858-9163; Knoblich, Juergen/0000-0002-6751-3404; Mechtler, Karl/0000-0002-3392-9946",Austrian Science Fund FWF [P 16629],,,28,130,132,1,16,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,10-Jul,2008,454,7201,,,,,241,U72,,10.1038/nature07014,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,323RU,WOS:000257466900049,18528333,No,,,11/20/17

Understanding the mechanism and kinetics of this transformation may shed light on the nature of developmental potency and suggest strategies with improved efficiency or safety. Here we report an integrative genomic analysis of reprogramming of mouse fibroblasts and B lymphocytes. Lineage- committed cells show a complex response to the ectopic expression involving induction of genes downstream of individual reprogramming factors. Fully reprogrammed cells show gene expression and epigenetic states that are highly similar to embryonic stem cells. In contrast, stable partially reprogrammed cell lines show reactivation of a distinctive subset of stem- cell- related genes, incomplete repression of lineage- specifying transcription factors, and DNA hypermethylation at pluripotency- related loci. These observations suggest that some cells may become trapped in partially reprogrammed states owing to incomplete repression of transcription factors, and that DNA de- methylation is an inefficient step in the transition to pluripotency. We demonstrate that RNA inhibition of transcription factors can facilitate reprogramming, and that treatment with DNA methyltransferase inhibitors can improve the overall efficiency of the reprogramming process.","[Mikkelsen, Tarjei S.; Zhang, Xiaolan; Bernstein, Bradley E.; Lander, Eric S.; Meissner, Alexander] MIT, Broad Inst, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; [Mikkelsen, Tarjei S.; Zhang, Xiaolan; Bernstein, Bradley E.; Lander, Eric S.; Meissner, Alexander] Harvard Univ, Broad Inst, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; [Mikkelsen, Tarjei S.] MIT, Div Hlth Sci & Technol, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Jaenisch, Rudolf; Lander, Eric S.] MIT, Dept Biol, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Hanna, Jacob; Wernig, Marius; Schorderet, Patrick; Jaenisch, Rudolf; Lander, Eric S.] Whitehead Inst Biomed Res, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; [Ku, Manching; Bernstein, Bradley E.] Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Mol Pathol Unit, Charlestown, MA 02129 USA; [Ku, Manching; Bernstein, Bradley E.] Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Ctr Canc Res, Charlestown, MA 02129 USA; [Bernstein, Bradley E.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Pathol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Lander, Eric S.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Syst Biol, Boston, MA 02114 USA; [Meissner, Alexander] Harvard Univ, Dept Stem Cell & Regenerat Biol, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA","Meissner, A (reprint author), MIT, Broad Inst, 7 Cambridge Ctr, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA.",alex@broad.mit.edu,"Mikkelsen, Tarjei/A-1306-2007; jia, xu/A-8386-2016; HANNA, JACOB/K-1339-2012","Mikkelsen, Tarjei/0000-0002-8133-3135; HANNA, JACOB/0000-0003-2042-9974","NHGRI NIH HHS [U54 HG003067-04, U54 HG003067]",,,33,890,946,5,77,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,3-Jul,2008,454,7200,,,,,49,U1,,10.1038/nature07056,,8,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,321MC,WOS:000257308300033,18509334,No,Y,N,11/20/17

Aberrant miRNA expression leads to developmental abnormalities and diseases, such as cardiovascular disorders and cancer; however, the stimuli and processes regulating miRNA biogenesis are largely unknown. The transforming growth factor beta ( TGF-beta) and bone morphogenetic protein ( BMP) family of growth factors orchestrates fundamental biological processes in development and in the homeostasis of adult tissues, including the vasculature. Here we show that induction of a contractile phenotype in human vascular smooth muscle cells by TGF-beta and BMPs is mediated by miR- 21. miR- 21 downregulates PDCD4 ( programmed cell death 4), which in turn acts as a negative regulator of smooth muscle contractile genes. Surprisingly, TGF-beta and BMP signalling promotes a rapid increase in expression of mature miR- 21 through a post- transcriptional step, promoting the processing of primary transcripts of miR- 21 ( pri- miR- 21) into precursor miR- 21 ( pre- miR- 21) by the DROSHA ( also known as RNASEN) complex. TGF-beta- and BMP- specific SMAD signal transducers are recruited to pri- miR- 21 in a complex with the RNA helicase p68 ( also known as DDX5), a component of the DROSHA microprocessor complex. The shared cofactor SMAD4 is not required for this process. Thus, regulation of miRNA biogenesis by ligand- specific SMAD proteins is critical for control of the vascular smooth muscle cell phenotype and potentially for SMAD4- independent responses mediated by the TGF-beta and BMP signalling pathways.","[Davis, Brandi N.; Hata, Akiko] Tufts Univ, Sch Med, Dept Biochem, Boston, MA 02111 USA; [Davis, Brandi N.; Hilyard, Aaron C.; Lagna, Giorgio; Hata, Akiko] Tufts Med Ctr, Mol Cardiol Res Inst, Boston, MA 02111 USA","Hata, A (reprint author), Tufts Univ, Sch Med, Dept Biochem, Boston, MA 02111 USA.",akiko.hata@tufts.edu,"Davis-Dusenbery, Brandi/N-2798-2013","Davis-Dusenbery, Brandi/0000-0001-7811-8613","NHLBI NIH HHS [HL082854, HL086572, R01 HL082854, R01 HL082854-03, R21 HL086572, R21 HL086572-02]; NICHD NIH HHS [HD042149, R01 HD042149, R01 HD042149-05]",,,50,824,865,0,61,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,3-Jul,2008,454,7200,,,,,56,U2,,10.1038/nature07086,,7,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,321MC,WOS:000257308300034,18548003,No,Y,N,11/20/17

The Voyager 2 plasma experiment observed a decrease in solar wind speed commencing on about 9 June 2007, which culminated in several crossings of the termination shock between 30 August and 1 September 2007 ( refs 4 - 7). Since then, Voyager 2 has remained in the heliosheath, the region of shocked solar wind. Here we report observations of plasma at and near the termination shock and in the heliosheath. The heliosphere is asymmetric, pushed inward in the Voyager 2 direction relative to the Voyager 1 direction. The termination shock is a weak, quasi- perpendicular shock that heats the thermal plasma very little.

The post- shock particles in the heliosheath have also been measured by Voyager 1 ( refs 3 - 5). It was not clear, however, what effect these particles might have on the physics of the shock transition until Voyager 2 crossed the shock on 31 August - 1 September 2007 ( refs 7 - 9). Unlike Voyager 1, Voyager 2 is making plasma measurements(7). Data from the plasma(7) and magnetic field(8) instruments on Voyager 2 indicate that non- thermal ion distributions probably have key roles in mediating dynamical processes at the termination shock and in the heliosheath. Here we report that intensities of low- energy ions measured by Voyager 2 produce non- thermal partial ion pressures in the heliosheath that are comparable to ( or exceed) both the thermal plasma pressures and the scalar magnetic field pressures.

A general feature of such systems, well documented yet not really understood, is the strongly nonlinear nature of the flow rule relating stresses and strain rates(4,5). Here we use a microfluidic velocimetry technique to characterize the flow of thin layers of concentrated emulsions, confined in gaps of different thicknesses by surfaces of different roughnesses. We find evidence for finite- size effects in the flow behaviour and the absence of an intrinsic local flow rule. In contrast to the classical nonlinearities of the rheological behaviour of amorphous materials, we show that a rather simple nonlocal flow rule can account for all the velocity profiles. This nonlocality of the dynamics is quantified by a length, characteristic of cooperativity within the flow at these scales, that is unobservable in the liquid state ( lower emulsion concentrations) and that increases with concentration in the jammed state. Beyond its practical importance for applications involving thin layers ( for example, coatings), these non- locality and cooperativity effects have parallels in the behaviour of other glassy, jammed and granular systems, suggesting a possible fundamental universality.","[Bocquet, L.] Univ Lyon 1, Lab PMCN, CNRS, UMR 5586, F-69622 Villeurbanne, France; [Goyon, J.; Colin, A.] Univ Bordeaux 1, LOF, UMR CNRS Rhodia Bordeaux 1 5258, F-33608 Pessac, France; [Ovarlez, G.] Univ Paris Est, Inst Navier, LMSGC, F-77420 Champs Sur Marne, France; [Ajdari, A.] Gulliver, UMR CNRS ESPCI 7083, F-75005 Paris, France; [Bocquet, L.] Tech Univ Munich, Dept Phys, D-85748 Garching, Germany","Bocquet, L (reprint author), Univ Lyon 1, Lab PMCN, CNRS, UMR 5586, F-69622 Villeurbanne, France.",annie.colin-exterieur@eu.rhodia.com; lyderic.bocquet@univ-lyon1.fr,"bocquet, lyderic/A-2241-2012; COLIN, Annie/K-8714-2012; Ovarlez, Guillaume/D-8496-2011","bocquet, lyderic/0000-0003-3577-5335; Ovarlez, Guillaume/0000-0003-1554-1080",,,,30,208,209,10,96,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,3-Jul,2008,454,7200,,,,,84,87,,10.1038/nature07026,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,321MC,WOS:000257308300041,18596806,No,Y,N,11/20/17

The conventional wisdom is that collisions with high impact parameters ( where the partners only 'graze' each other) are forward scattered and essentially elastic, whereas collisions with low impact parameters transfer a large amount of energy into vibrations and are mainly back scattered(3). Here we report experimental observations of exactly the opposite behaviour for the simplest and most studied of all neutral - neutral collisions: we find that the inelastic scattering process H + D-2 (nu = 0, j = 0, 2) --> H + D-2 (nu' = 3, j' = 0, 2, 4, 6, 8) leads dominantly to forward scattering (nu and j respectively refer to the vibrational and rotational quantum numbers of the D-2 molecule). Quasi- classical trajectory calculations show that the vibrational excitation is caused by extension, not compression, of the D - D bond through interaction with the passing H atom. However, the H - D interaction never becomes strong enough for capture of the H atom before it departs with diminished kinetic energy; that is, the inelastic scattering process is essentially a frustrated reaction in which the collision typically excites the outward- going half of the H - D - D symmetric stretch before the H - D-2 complex dissociates. We suggest that this 'tug of war' between H and D-2 is a new mechanism for vibrational excitation that should play a role in all neutral - neutral collisions where strong attraction can develop between the collision partners.","[Goldberg, Noah T.; Zhang, Jianyang; Miller, Daniel J.; Zare, Richard N.] Stanford Univ, Dept Chem, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Greaves, Stuart J.] Univ Bristol, Sch Chem, Laser Chem Spect & Dynam Grp, Bristol BS8 1TS, Avon, England; [Wrede, Eckart] Univ Durham, Dept Chem, Durham DH1 3LE, England","Zare, RN (reprint author), Stanford Univ, Dept Chem, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",zare@stanford.edu,"Zare, Richard/A-8410-2009; Wrede, Eckart/E-7366-2012; Greaves, Stuart/D-9213-2011","Wrede, Eckart/0000-0001-6773-8446; Greaves, Stuart/0000-0002-5238-7150",,,,28,40,41,2,31,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,3-Jul,2008,454,7200,,,,,88,91,,10.1038/nature07079,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,321MC,WOS:000257308300042,18596807,No,,,11/20/17

The oceans are a principal sink for anthropogenic CO(2) where it is estimated to have caused a 30% increase in the concentration of H(+) in ocean surface waters since the early 1900s and may lead to a drop in seawater pH of up to 0.5 units by 2100 ( refs 2, 3). Our understanding of how increased ocean acidity may affect marine ecosystems is at present very limited as almost all studies have been in vitro, short- term, rapid perturbation experiments on isolated elements of the ecosystem(4,5). Here we show the effects of acidification on benthic ecosystems at shallow coastal sites where volcanic CO(2) vents lower the pH of the water column. Along gradients of normal pH ( 8.1 - 8.2) to lowered pH ( mean 7.8 - 7.9, minimum 7.4 - 7.5), typical rocky shore communities with abundant calcareous organisms shifted to communities lacking scleractinian corals with significant reductions in sea urchin and coralline algal abundance. To our knowledge, this is the first ecosystem- scale validation of predictions that these important groups of organisms are susceptible to elevated amounts of p(CO2). Sea- grass production was highest in an area at mean pH 7.6 ( 1,827 mu atm p(CO2)) where coralline algal biomass was significantly reduced and gastropod shells were dissolving due to periods of carbonate sub- saturation. The species populating the vent sites comprise a suite of organisms that are resilient to naturally high concentrations of p(CO2) and indicate that ocean acidification may benefit highly invasive non- native algal species. Our results provide the first in situ insights into how shallow water marine communities might change when susceptible organisms are removed owing to ocean acidification.","[Hall-Spencer, Jason M.; Rodolfo-Metalpa, Riccardo; Ransome, Emma; Rowley, Sonia J.] Univ Plymouth, Marine Biol & Ecol Res Ctr, Inst Marine, Plymouth PL4 8AA, Devon, England; [Martin, Sophie] Univ Paris 06, CNRS, F-06234 Villefranche Sur Mer, France; [Fine, Maoz] Bar Ilan Univ, Fac Life Sci, IL-52900 Ramat Gan, Israel; [Fine, Maoz] Interuniv Inst Marine Sci, IL-88103 Elat, Israel; [Turner, Suzanne M.] Univ E Anglia, Sch Environm Sci, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England; [Tedesco, Dario] Univ Naples 2, Dept Environm Sci, I-81100 Caserta, Italy; [Tedesco, Dario] CNR, Ist Geol Ambientale & Geoingn, I-00138 Rome, Italy; [Buia, Maria-Cristina] Stn Zool Anton Dohrn, Lab Ecol Benthos, I-80077 Naples, Italy","Hall-Spencer, JM (reprint author), Univ Plymouth, Marine Biol & Ecol Res Ctr, Inst Marine, Plymouth PL4 8AA, Devon, England.",jhall-spencer@plymouth.ac.uk,"Hall-Spencer, Jason/F-9179-2013; Biblio, LOV/K-9251-2017","Hall-Spencer, Jason/0000-0002-6915-2518",,,,22,589,607,39,438,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,3-Jul,2008,454,7200,,,,,96,99,,10.1038/nature07051,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,321MC,WOS:000257308300044,18536730,No,Y,N,11/20/17

Stochasticity can be divided into four categories, which include the probabilistic nature of birth and death at the level of individuals ( demographic stochasticity(2)), variation in population- level birth and death rates among times or locations ( environmental stochasticity(1,3)), the sex of individuals(6,8) and variation in vital rates among individuals within a population ( demographic heterogeneity(7,9)). Mechanistic stochastic models that include all of these factors have not previously been developed to examine their combined effects on extinction risk. Here we derive a family of stochastic Ricker models using different combinations of all these stochastic factors, and show that extinction risk depends strongly on the combination of factors that contribute to stochasticity. Furthermore, we show that only with the full stochastic model can the relative importance of environmental and demographic variability, and therefore extinction risk, be correctly determined. Using the full model, we find that demographic sources of stochasticity are the prominent cause of variability in a laboratory population of Tribolium castaneum ( red flour beetle), whereas using only the standard simpler models would lead to the erroneous conclusion that environmental variability dominates. Our results demonstrate that current estimates of extinction risk for natural populations could be greatly underestimated because variability has been mistakenly attributed to the environment rather than the demographic factors described here that entail much higher extinction risk for the same variability level.","[Melbourne, Brett A.] Univ Colorado, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Hastings, Alan] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Environm Sci & Policy, Davis, CA 95616 USA","Melbourne, BA (reprint author), Univ Colorado, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Boulder, CO 80309 USA.",brett.melbourne@colorado.edu,,"MELBOURNE, BRETT/0000-0002-8843-4131",,,,30,211,215,2,206,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,3-Jul,2008,454,7200,,,,,100,103,,10.1038/nature06922,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,321MC,WOS:000257308300045,18596809,No,,,11/20/17

Laser ablations have shown that the strongest deficits in chemotaxis to salts are obtained when the ASE chemosensory neurons ( ASEL and ASER) are ablated, indicating that this pair has a dominant role(4). Although these neurons are left - right homologues anatomically, they exhibit marked asymmetries in gene expression and ion preference(5-7). Here, using optical recordings of calcium concentration in ASE neurons in intact animals, we demonstrate an additional asymmetry: ASEL is an ON- cell, stimulated by increases in NaCl concentration, whereas ASER is an OFF-cell, stimulated by decreases in NaCl concentration. Both responses are reliable yet transient, indicating that ASE neurons report changes in concentration rather than absolute levels. Recordings from synaptic and sensory transduction mutants show that the ON - OFF asymmetry is the result of intrinsic differences between ASE neurons. Unilateral activation experiments indicate that the asymmetry extends to the level of behavioural output: ASEL lengthens bouts of forward locomotion ( runs) whereas ASER promotes direction changes ( turns). Notably, the input and output asymmetries of ASE neurons are precisely those of a simple yet novel neuronal motif for computing the time derivative of chemosensory information, which is the fundamental computation of C. elegans chemotaxis(3,8). Evidence for ON and OFF cells in other chemosensory networks(9-12) suggests that this motif may be common in animals that navigate by taste and smell.","[Thiele, Tod R.; Faumont, Serge; Lockery, Shawn R.] Univ Oregon, Inst Neurosci, Eugene, OR 97403 USA; [Suzuki, Hiroshi; Schafer, William R.] Univ Calif San Diego, Div Biol Sci, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Ezcurra, Marina; Schafer, William R.] MRC, Mol Biol Lab, Cambridge CB2 0QH, England","Lockery, SR (reprint author), Univ Oregon, Inst Neurosci, Eugene, OR 97403 USA.",shawn@uoregon.edu,"Marion-Poll, Frederic/D-8882-2011","Marion-Poll, Frederic/0000-0001-6824-0180; Schafer, William/0000-0002-6676-8034","Medical Research Council [MC_U105185857]; NIDA NIH HHS [DA016445, R01 DA016445]; NIMH NIH HHS [R21 MH112105, MH051383, R01 MH051383, R01 MH051383-14, R29 MH051383]",,,32,107,119,2,24,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,3-Jul,2008,454,7200,,,,,114,U6,,10.1038/nature06927,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,321MC,WOS:000257308300048,18596810,No,,,11/20/17

This relapse is often induced by exposure to cues associated with cocaine use. To account for the persistent propensity for relapse, it has been suggested(1) that cue- induced cocaine craving increases over the first several weeks of abstinence and remains high for extended periods. We and others identified an analogous phenomenon in rats that was termed 'incubation of cocaine craving': time- dependent increases in cue- induced cocaine- seeking over the first months after withdrawal from self- administered cocaine(2-4). Cocaine- seeking requires the activation of glutamate projections that excite receptors for alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid ( AMPA) in the nucleus accumbens(5-7). Here we show that the number of synaptic AMPA receptors in the accumbens is increased after prolonged withdrawal from cocaine self-administration by the addition of new AMPA receptors lacking glutamate receptor 2 ( GluR2). Furthermore, we show that these new receptors mediate the incubation of cocaine craving. Our results indicate that GluR2- lacking AMPA receptors could be a new target for drug development for the treatment of cocaine addiction. We propose that after prolonged withdrawal from cocaine, increased numbers of synaptic AMPA receptors combined with the higher conductance of GluR2- lacking AMPA receptors(8,9) causes increased reactivity of accumbens neurons to cocaine- related cues, leading to an intensification of drug craving and relapse.","[Conrad, Kelly L.; Reimers, Jeremy M.; Wolf, Marina E.] Rosalind Franklin Univ Med & Sci, Dept Neurosci, N Chicago, IL 60064 USA; [Tseng, Kuei Y.; Heng, Li-Jun; Marinelli, Michela] Rosalind Franklin Univ Med & Sci, Dept Mol & Cellular Pharmacol, N Chicago, IL 60064 USA; [Uejima, Jamie L.; Shaham, Yavin] NIDA, Behav Neurosci Branch, IRP, NIH, Baltimore, MD 21224 USA","Wolf, ME (reprint author), Rosalind Franklin Univ Med & Sci, Dept Neurosci, 3333 Green Bay Rd, N Chicago, IL 60064 USA.",marina.wolf@rosalindfranklin.edu,"shaham, yavin/G-1306-2014",,"Intramural NIH HHS [Z01 DA000434-08]; NIDA NIH HHS [DA00453, DA015835, DA020654, DA09621, K02 DA000453, R01 DA009621, R01 DA015835, R01 DA020654, R37 DA015835]",,,50,429,433,4,34,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,3-Jul,2008,454,7200,,,,,118,U9,,10.1038/nature06995,,7,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,321MC,WOS:000257308300049,18500330,No,Y,N,11/20/17

Modern cells therefore require sophisticated protein channels and pumps to mediate the exchange of molecules with their environment. The strong barrier function of membranes has made it difficult to understand the origin of cellular life and has been thought to preclude a heterotrophic lifestyle for primitive cells. Although nucleotides can cross dimyristoyl phosphatidylcholine membranes through defects formed at the gel- to- liquid transition temperature(1,2), phospholipid membranes lack the dynamic properties required for membrane growth. Fatty acids and their corresponding alcohols and glycerol monoesters are attractive candidates for the components of protocell membranes because they are simple amphiphiles that form bilayer membrane vesicles(3-5) that retain encapsulated oligonucleotides(3,6) and are capable of growth and division(7-9). Here we show that such membranes allow the passage of charged molecules such as nucleotides, so that activated nucleotides added to the outside of a model protocell spontaneously cross the membrane and take part in efficient template copying in the protocell interior. The permeability properties of prebiotically plausible membranes suggest that primitive protocells could have acquired complex nutrients from their environment in the absence of any macromolecular transport machinery; that is, they could have been obligate heterotrophs.","[Mansy, Sheref S.; Schrum, Jason P.; Krishnamurthy, Mathangi; Tobe, Sylvia; Treco, Douglas A.; Szostak, Jack W.] Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Dept Mol Biol, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Boston, MA 02114 USA; [Mansy, Sheref S.; Schrum, Jason P.; Krishnamurthy, Mathangi; Tobe, Sylvia; Treco, Douglas A.; Szostak, Jack W.] Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Ctr Computat & Integrat Biol, Boston, MA 02114 USA","Szostak, JW (reprint author), Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Dept Mol Biol, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Boston, MA 02114 USA.",szostak@molbio.mgh.harvard.edu,"Mansy, Sheref/E-6266-2010","Mansy, Sheref/0000-0003-2382-198X","Howard Hughes Medical Institute; NIGMS NIH HHS [F32 GM074506-01, F32 GM07450601]",,,34,318,329,20,156,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,3-Jul,2008,454,7200,,,,,122,U10,,10.1038/nature07018,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,321MC,WOS:000257308300050,18528332,No,Y,N,11/20/17

Recruitment of TLS to the CCND1 promoter to cause gene- specific repression is directed by single- stranded, low- copy- number ncRNA transcripts tethered to the 5' regulatory regions of CCND1 that are induced in response to DNA damage signals. Our data suggest that signal-induced ncRNAs localized to regulatory regions of transcription units can act cooperatively as selective ligands, recruiting and modulating the activities of distinct classes of RNA- binding co-regulators in response to specific signals, providing an unexpected ncRNA/RNA-binding protein-based strategy to integrate transcriptional programmes.","[Arai, Shigeki; Du, Kun; Kurokawa, Riki] Saitama Med Univ, Res Ctr Genom Med, Div Gene Struct & Funct, Hidaka, Saitama 3501241, Japan; [Wang, Xiangting; Song, Xiaoyuan; Rosenfeld, Michael G.] Univ Calif San Diego, Sch Med, Howard Hughes Med Inst, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Wang, Xiangting] Univ Calif San Diego, Sch Med, Mol Pathol Grad Program, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Reichart, Donna; Pascual, Gabriel; Glass, Christopher K.] Univ Calif San Diego, Sch Med, Dept Cellular & Mol Med, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Pascual, Gabriel; Rosenfeld, Michael G.; Glass, Christopher K.] Univ Calif San Diego, Sch Med, Dept Med, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Tempst, Paul] Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Program Mol Biol, New York, NY 10021 USA","Kurokawa, R (reprint author), Saitama Med Univ, Res Ctr Genom Med, Div Gene Struct & Funct, 1397-1 Yamane, Hidaka, Saitama 3501241, Japan.",mgr@ucsd.edu; ckg@ucsd.edu; rkurokaw@saitama-med.ac.jp,"Song, Xiaoyuan/P-1094-2014","Song, Xiaoyuan/0000-0002-9011-5033; Tempst, Paul/0000-0002-6680-3987","Howard Hughes Medical Institute; NCI NIH HHS [CA097134, CA52599, P30 CA008748, P30 CA08748, R01 CA052599, R01 CA052599-19]; NHLBI NIH HHS [R01 HL059694, HL59694, R01 HL059694-10]; NIDDK NIH HHS [DK074868, DK39949, R01 DK039949, R01 DK091183, R37 DK039949, R37 DK039949-26]; NINDS NIH HHS [NS34934, R01 NS034934, R01 NS034934-20A1]",,,29,502,555,9,64,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,3-Jul,2008,454,7200,,,,,126,U11,,10.1038/nature06992,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,321MC,WOS:000257308300051,18509338,No,Y,N,11/20/17

Although the central proteins involved in shaping this gradient are well characterized, their integrated function, and in particular how pattern scales with size, is not understood. Here we present evidence that in Xenopus, the BMP activity gradient is defined by a 'shuttling- based' mechanism, whereby the BMP ligands are translocated ventrally through their association with the BMP inhibitor Chordin.

The root of this dichotomy is a change in crustal thickness along an apparently irregular boundary, which can be traced around the planet, except where it is presumably buried beneath the Tharsis volcanic rise(1,2). The isostatic compensation of these distinct provinces(2,3) and the ancient population of impact craters buried beneath the young lowlands surface(4) suggest that the dichotomy is one of the most ancient features on the planet(3). However, the origin of this dichotomy has remained uncertain, with little evidence to distinguish between the suggested causes: a giant impact(5,6) or mantle convection/ overturn(7-9). Here we use the gravity(10) and topography(11) of Mars to constrain the location of the dichotomy boundary beneath Tharsis, taking advantage of the different modes of compensation for Tharsis and the dichotomy to separate their effects. We find that the dichotomy boundary along its entire path around the planet is accurately fitted by an ellipse measuring approximately 10,600 by 8,500 km, centred at 67 degrees N, 208 degrees E. We suggest that the elliptical nature of the crustal dichotomy is most simply explained by a giant impact, representing the largest such structure thus far identified in the Solar System.","[Andrews-Hanna, Jeffrey C.; Zuber, Maria T.] MIT, Dept Earth Atmospher & Planetary Sci, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Banerdt, W.

Despite the prominence of the dichotomy, its origin has remained enigmatic and models for its formation largely untested(3-5). Endogenic degree-1 convection models with north - south asymmetry are incomplete in that they are restricted to simulating only mantle dynamics and they neglect crustal evolution, whereas exogenic multiple impact events are statistically unlikely to concentrate in one hemisphere(6). A single mega-impact of the requisite size has not previously been modelled. However, it has been hypothesized that such an event could obliterate the evidence of its occurrence by completely covering the surface with melt(7) or catastrophically disrupting the planet(3,8). Here we present a set of single- impact initial conditions by which a large impactor can produce features consistent with the observed dichotomy's crustal structure and persistence. Using three- dimensional hydrodynamic simulations, large variations are predicted in post- impact states depending on impact energy, velocity and, importantly, impact angle, with trends more pronounced or unseen in commonly studied smaller impacts(9). For impact energies of similar to(3-6) x 10(29) J, at low impact velocities (6-10 km s(-1)) and oblique impact angles ( 30 - 60 degrees), the resulting crustal removal boundary is similar in size and ellipticity to the observed characteristics of the lowlands basin. Under these conditions, the melt distribution is largely contained within the area of impact and thus does not erase the evidence of the impact's occurrence. The antiquity of the dichotomy(10) is consistent with the contemporaneous presence of impactors of diameter 1,600 - 2,700 km in Mars- crossing orbits(3), and the impact angle is consistent with the expected distribution(11).","[Marinova, Margarita M.; Aharonson, Oded] CALTECH, Div Geol & Planetary Sci, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA; [Asphaug, Erik] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Earth Sci, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA","Marinova, MM (reprint author), CALTECH, Div Geol & Planetary Sci, MC 150-21, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA.",mmm@caltech.edu,,,,,,29,94,95,0,18,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,26-Jun,2008,453,7199,,,,,1216,1219,,10.1038/nature07070,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,318FA,WOS:000257075800037,18580945,No,,,11/20/17

The dichotomy may have arisen as a result of internal mechanisms such as convection(4,5). Alternatively, it may have been caused by one(6) or several(7) giant impacts, but quantitative tests of the impact hypothesis have not been published. Here we use a high- resolution, two-dimensional, axially symmetric hydrocode(8,9) to model vertical impacts over a range of parameters appropriate to early Mars. We propose that the impact model, in addition to excavating a crustal cavity of the correct size, explains two other observations. First, crustal disruption(10) at the impact antipode is probably responsible for the observed antipodal decline in magnetic field strength(11). Second, the impact- generated melt forming the northern lowlands crust is predicted to derive from a deep, depleted mantle source. This prediction is consistent with characteristics of martian shergottite meteorites(12,13) and suggests a dichotomy formation time similar to 100 Myr after martian accretion(13), comparable to that of the Moon- forming impact on Earth(14).","[Nimmo, F.; Hart, S.

A new family of superconductors with the general composition of LaFeAsO1-xFx has recently been discovered(1-8) and the conspicuous lack of the CuO2 planes raises the tantalizing question of a different pairing mechanism in these oxypnictides. The superconducting gap ( its magnitude, structure, and temperature dependence) is intimately related to pairing. Here we report the observation of a single gap in the superconductor SmFeAsO0.85F0.15 with T-c= 42 K as measured by Andreev spectroscopy. The gap value of 2 Delta = 13.34 +/- 0.3meV gives 2 Delta/k(B)T(c) = 3.68 ( where k(B) is the Boltzmann constant), close to the Bardeen Cooper - Schrieffer ( BCS) prediction of 3.53. The gap decreases with temperature and vanishes at T-c in a manner consistent with the BCS prediction, but dramatically different from that of the pseudogap behaviour in the copper oxide superconductors. Our results clearly indicate a nodeless gap order parameter, which is nearly isotropic in size across different sections of the Fermi surface, and are not compatible with models involving antiferromagnetic fluctuations, strong correlations, the t- J model, and the like, originally designed for the high- T-c copper oxides.","[Chen, T.

In addition to generating two or more stereocentres in a single reaction, multiple asymmetric reactions also impart increased enantiomeric excess to the final product in comparison with the analogous single transformation(3-6). Furthermore, multiple asymmetric operations have the potential to independently construct several stereocentres at remote points within the same molecular scaffold, rather than relying on pre- existing chiral centres that are proximal to the reactive site(1). Despite the inherent benefits of multiple catalytic enantioselective reactions, their application to natural product total synthesis remains largely underutilized(2). Here we report the use of a double stereoablative(7) enantioselective alkylation reaction in a concise synthesis of the marine diterpenoid ( -)-cyanthiwigin F ( ref. 8). By employing a technique for independent, selective formation of two stereocentres in a single stereoconvergent operation, we demonstrate that a complicated mixture of racemic and meso diastereomers may be smoothly converted to a synthetically useful intermediate with exceptional enantiomeric excess.

A large proportion of tropospheric ozone loss occurs in the tropical marine boundary layer(2,3) and is thought to be driven primarily by high ozone photolysis rates in the presence of high concentrations of water vapour. A further reduction in the tropospheric ozone burden through bromine and iodine emitted from open- ocean marine sources has been postulated by numerical models(4-7), but thus far has not been verified by observations. Here we report eight months of spectroscopic measurements at the Cape Verde Observatory indicative of the ubiquitous daytime presence of bromine monoxide and iodine monoxide in the tropical marine boundary layer. A year- round data set of co- located in situ surface trace gas measurements made in conjunction with low- level aircraft observations shows that the mean daily observed ozone loss is similar to 50 per cent greater than that simulated by a global chemistry model using a classical photochemistry scheme that excludes halogen chemistry. We perform box model calculations that indicate that the observed halogen concentrations induce the extra ozone loss required for the models to match observations. Our results show that halogen chemistry has a significant and extensive influence on photochemical ozone loss in the tropical Atlantic Ocean boundary layer. The omission of halogen sources and their chemistry in atmospheric models may lead to significant errors in calculations of global ozone budgets, tropospheric oxidizing capacity and methane oxidation rates, both historically and in the future.","[Read, Katie A.; Carpenter, Lucy J.; Moller, Sarah J.] Univ York, Dept Chem, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England; [Mahajan, Anoop S.; Heard, Dwayne E.; Oetjen, Hilke; Pilling, Michael J.; Plane, John M.

Although only a small fraction of this vast volcanic terrain has been visually surveyed or sampled, the available evidence suggests that explosive eruptions are rare on mid- ocean ridges, particularly at depths below the critical point for seawater ( 3,000 m)(1). A pyroclastic deposit has never been observed on the sea floor below 3,000 m, presumably because the volatile content of mid- ocean- ridge basalts is generally too low to produce the gas fractions required for fragmenting a magma at such high hydrostatic pressure. We employed new deep submergence technologies during an International Polar Year expedition to the Gakkel ridge in the Arctic Basin at 856 E, to acquire photographic and video images of 'zero- age' volcanic terrain on this remote, ice- covered ridge. Here we present images revealing that the axial valley at 4,000 m water depth is blanketed with unconsolidated pyroclastic deposits, including bubble wall fragments (limu o Pele)(2), covering a large ( > 10 km(2)) area. At least 13.5 wt% CO(2) is necessary to fragment magma at these depths(3), which is about tenfold the highest values previously measured in a mid- ocean- ridge basalt(4). These observations raise important questions about the accumulation and discharge of magmatic volatiles at ultraslow spreading rates on the Gakkel ridge(5) and demonstrate that large- scale pyroclastic activity is possible along even the deepest portions of the global mid- ocean ridge volcanic system.","[Sohn, Robert A.; Willis, Claire; Humphris, Susan; Shank, Timothy M.; Singh, Hanumant; Kunz, Clayton; Murphy, Christopher; Winsor, Peter; Soule, Adam] Woods Hole Oceanog Inst, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA; [Edmonds, Henrietta N.; Upchurch, Lucia] Univ Texas Austin, Inst Marine Sci, Port Aransas, TX 78373 USA; [Hedman, Ulf] Swedish Polar Secretariat, S-10405 Stockholm, Sweden; [Helmke, Elisabeth; Linder, Julia; Schlindwein, Vera; Tausenfreund, Maria] Alfred Wegener Inst Polar & Marine Res, D-27570 Bremerhaven, Germany; [Jakuba, Michael] Johns Hopkins Univ, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA; [Liljebladh, Bengt; Stranne, Christian] Univ Gothenburg, S-40530 Gothenburg, Sweden; [Nakamura, Ko-ichi] AIST, Higashi, Tokyo, Japan; [Sato, Taichi] Univ Tokyo, Ocean Res Inst, Tokyo 1648639, Japan; [Jakobsson, Martin] Stockholm Univ, Dept Geol & Geochem, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden","Sohn, RA (reprint author), Woods Hole Oceanog Inst, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA.",rsohn@whoi.edu,"stranne, christian/A-3932-2010; Jakobsson, Martin/F-6214-2010; stranne, christian/L-4382-2013","stranne, christian/0000-0003-1004-5213; Upchurch, Lucia/0000-0003-1351-6332; Soule, Adam/0000-0002-4691-6300; Jakobsson, Martin/0000-0002-9033-3559; Sohn, Robert/0000-0002-9050-8603",,,,23,62,65,0,37,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,26-Jun,2008,453,7199,,,,,1236,1238,,10.1038/nature07075,,3,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,318FA,WOS:000257075800042,18580949,No,,,11/20/17

Alternative start and polyadenylation sites and regulation of intron splicing add additional dimensions to the rich transcriptional output(10,11). This transcriptional complexity has been sampled mainly using hybridization- based methods under one or few experimental conditions. Here we applied direct high- throughput sequencing of complementary DNAs ( RNA- Seq), supplemented with data from high- density tiling arrays, to globally sample transcripts of the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, independently from available gene annotations. We interrogated transcriptomes under multiple conditions, including rapid proliferation, meiotic differentiation and environmental stress, as well as in RNA processing mutants to reveal the dynamic plasticity of the transcriptional landscape as a function of environmental, developmental and genetic factors. High- throughput sequencing proved to be a powerful and quantitative method to sample transcriptomes deeply at maximal resolution. In contrast to hybridization, sequencing showed little, if any, background noise and was sensitive enough to detect widespread transcription in >90% of the genome, including traces of RNAs that were not robustly transcribed or rapidly degraded. The combined sequencing and strand- specific array data provide rich condition- specific information on novel, mostly non- coding transcripts, untranslated regions and gene structures, thus improving the existing genome annotation. Sequence reads spanning exon-exon or exon - intron junctions give unique insight into a surprising variability in splicing efficiency across introns, genes and conditions. Splicing efficiency was largely coordinated with transcript levels, and increased transcription led to increased splicing in test genes. Hundreds of introns showed such regulated splicing during cellular proliferation or differentiation.","[Wilhelm, Brian T.; Marguerat, Samuel; Watt, Stephen; Schubert, Falk; Wood, Valerie; Goodhead, Ian; Penkett, Christopher J.; Rogers, Jane; Bahler, Jurg] Wellcome Trust Sanger Inst, Canc Res UK Fiss Yeast Funct Genom Grp, Cambridge CB10 1HH, England","Bahler, J (reprint author), UCL, Dept Genet Evolut & Environm, Mortimer St, London WC1E 6BT, England.",jurg@sanger.ac.uk,"; Bahler, Jurg/B-4572-2009","Goodhead, Ian/0000-0002-3110-9442; Wood, Valerie/0000-0001-6330-7526; Bahler, Jurg/0000-0003-4036-1532","Cancer Research UK [A6517, C9546/A6517]; Wellcome Trust [, 077118]",,,31,613,657,3,101,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,26-Jun,2008,453,7199,,,,,1239,U39,,10.1038/nature07002,,7,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,318FA,WOS:000257075800043,18488015,No,Y,N,11/20/17

The capability to retain, recall and integrate such positional information into guiding behaviour has been summarized under the term spatial working memory(1). This kind of memory contains specific details of the presence that are not necessarily part of a long- term memory. Neurophysiological studies in primates(2) indicate that sustained activity of neurons encodes the sensory information even though the object is no longer present. Furthermore they suggest that dopamine transmits the respective input to the prefrontal cortex, and simultaneous suppression by GABA spatially restricts this neuronal activity(3). Here we show that Drosophila melanogaster possesses a similar spatial memory during locomotion. Using a new detour setup, we show that flies can remember the position of an object for several seconds after it has been removed from their environment. In this setup, flies are temporarily lured away from the direction towards their hidden target, yet they are thereafter able to aim for their former target. Furthermore, we find that the GABAergic ( stainable with antibodies against GABA) ring neurons(4) of the ellipsoid body in the central brain are necessary and their plasticity is sufficient for a functional spatial orientation memory in flies. We also find that the protein kinase S6KII ( ignorant)(5) is required in a distinct subset of ring neurons to display this memory. Conditional expression of S6KII in these neurons only in adults can restore the loss of the orientation memory of the ignorant mutant. The S6KII signalling pathway therefore seems to be acutely required in the ring neurons for spatial orientation memory in flies.","[Neuser, Kirsa; Triphan, Tilman; Mronz, Markus; Poeck, Burkhard; Strauss, Roland] Univ Wurzburg, Lehrstuhl Genet & Neurobiol, Biozentrum, D-97074 Wurzburg, Germany","Strauss, R (reprint author), Johannes Gutenberg Univ Mainz, Inst Zool Neurobiol 3, Col Kleinmann Weg 2, D-55099 Mainz, Germany.",rstrauss@uni-mainz.de,,,,,,30,169,170,5,29,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,26-Jun,2008,453,7199,,,,,1244,U44,,10.1038/nature07003,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,318FA,WOS:000257075800044,18509336,No,,,11/20/17

Theta- phase precession is a change in spike timing in which the place cell fires at progressively earlier phases of the extracellular theta rhythm as the animal crosses the spatially restricted firing field of the neuron(1-5). Within individual theta cycles, this phase advance results in a compressed replication of the firing sequence of consecutively activated place cells along the animal's trajectory(2,6-8), at a timescale short enough to enable spike-time-dependent plasticity between neurons in different parts of the sequence. The neuronal circuitry required for phase precession has not yet been established. The fact that phase precession can be seen in hippocampal output stuctures such as the prefrontal cortex(9) suggests either that efferent structures inherit the precession from the hippocampus or that it is generated locally in those structures. Here we show that phase precession is expressed independently of the hippocampus in spatially modulated grid cells(10,11) in layer II of medial entorhinal cortex, one synapse upstream of the hippocampus. Phase precession is apparent in nearly all principal cells in layer II but only sparsely in layer III. The precession in layer II is not blocked by inactivation of the hippocampus, suggesting that the phase advance is generated in the grid cell network. The results point to possible mechanisms for grid formation and raise the possibility that hippocampal phase precession is inherited from entorhinal cortex.","[Hafting, Torkel; Fyhn, Marianne; Bonnevie, Tora; Moser, May-Britt; Moser, Edvard I.] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Kavli Inst Syst Neurosci, NO-7489 Trondheim, Norway; [Hafting, Torkel; Fyhn, Marianne; Bonnevie, Tora; Moser, May-Britt; Moser, Edvard I.] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Ctr Biol Memory, NO-7489 Trondheim, Norway","Moser, EI (reprint author), Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Kavli Inst Syst Neurosci, NO-7489 Trondheim, Norway.",edvard.moser@ntnu.no,,"Hafting, Torkel/0000-0002-0928-3487",,,,30,210,211,2,43,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,26-Jun,2008,453,7199,,,,,1248,U50,,10.1038/nature06957,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,318FA,WOS:000257075800045,18480753,No,,,11/20/17

The lateral amygdala ( LA) is important for assigning emotional and motivational significance to discrete environmental cues(1-4), including those that signal rewarding events(5-8). Recognizing that a cue predicts a reward enhances an animal's ability to acquire that reward; however, the cellular and synaptic mechanisms that underlie cue - reward learning are unclear. Here we show that marked changes in both cue- induced neuronal firing and input- specific synaptic strength occur with the successful acquisition of a cue - reward association within a single training session. We performed both in vivo and ex vivo electrophysiological recordings in the LA of rats trained to self- administer sucrose. We observed that reward- learning success increased in proportion to the number of amygdala neurons that responded phasically to a reward- predictive cue. Furthermore, cue - reward learning induced an AMPA (alpha-amino- 3- hydroxy- 5- methyl-isoxazole propionic acid)- receptor- mediated increase in the strength of thalamic, but not cortical, synapses in the LA that was apparent immediately after the first training session. The level of learning attained by individual subjects was highly correlated with the degree of synaptic strength enhancement. Importantly, intra-LA NMDA ( N- methyl- D- aspartate)- receptor blockade impaired reward- learning performance and attenuated the associated increase in synaptic strength. These findings provide evidence of a connection between LA synaptic plasticity and cue - reward learning, potentially representing a key mechanism underlying goal-directed behaviour.","[Tye, Kay M.; Stuber, Garret D.; de Ridder, Bram; Bonci, Antonello; Janak, Patricia H.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Ernest Gallo Clin & Res Ctr, Emeryville, CA 94608 USA; [Stuber, Garret D.; Bonci, Antonello; Janak, Patricia H.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Program Neurosci, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; [Bonci, Antonello; Janak, Patricia H.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Neurol, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; [Bonci, Antonello; Janak, Patricia H.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Wheeler Ctr Neurobiol Addict, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA","Janak, PH (reprint author), Univ Calif San Francisco, Ernest Gallo Clin & Res Ctr, Emeryville, CA 94608 USA.",pjanak@gallo.ucsf.edu,"Stuber, Garret/E-1160-2011; Tye, Kay/J-6158-2013","Tye, Kay/0000-0002-2435-0182; Stuber, Garret/0000-0003-1730-4855; Janak, Patricia/0000-0002-3333-9049","NIDA NIH HHS [R01 DA015096, R01 DA015096-06, R01DA115096]; NIDDK NIH HHS [DP2 DK102256]",,,30,99,99,1,12,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,26-Jun,2008,453,7199,,,,,1253,U56,,10.1038/nature06963,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,318FA,WOS:000257075800046,18469802,No,,,11/20/17

Antiviral drugs are seen as essential requirements for control of initial influenza outbreaks caused by a new virus, and in pre- pandemic plans there is a heavy reliance on drug stockpiles. The principal target for these drugs is a virus surface glycoprotein, neuraminidase, which facilitates the release of nascent virus and thus the spread of infection. Oseltamivir (Tamiflu) and zanamivir ( Relenza) are two currently used neuraminidase inhibitors that were developed using knowledge of the enzyme structure(1,2). It has been proposed that the closer such inhibitors resemble the natural substrate, the less likely they are to select drug- resistant mutant viruses that retain viability(3). However, there have been reports of drug- resistant mutant selection in vitro(4) and from infected humans(5,6). We report here the enzymatic properties and crystal structures of neuraminidase mutants from H5N1- infected patients that explain the molecular basis of resistance. Our results show that these mutants are resistant to oseltamivir but still strongly inhibited by zanamivir owing to an altered hydrophobic pocket in the active site of the enzyme required for oseltamivir binding. Together with recent reports of the viability and pathogenesis of H5N1 ( ref. 7) and H1N1 ( ref. 8) viruses with neuraminidases carrying these mutations, our results indicate that it would be prudent for pandemic stockpiles of oseltamivir to be augmented by additional antiviral drugs, including zanamivir.","[Collins, Patrick J.; Haire, Lesley F.; Lin, Yi Pu; Liu, Junfeng; Walker, Philip A.; Skehel, John J.; Martin, Stephen R.; Hay, Alan J.; Gamblin, Steven J.] Natl Inst Med Res, MRC, London NW7 1AA, England; [Russell, Rupert J.] Univ St Andrews, Interdisciplinary Ctr Human & Avian Influenza Res, Sch Biol, St Andrews KY16 9ST, Fife, Scotland","Gamblin, SJ (reprint author), Natl Inst Med Res, MRC, Mill Hill, London NW7 1AA, England.",sgambli@nimr.mrc.ac.uk,,"Gamblin, Steven/0000-0001-5331-639X","Medical Research Council [, MC_U117512711, MC_U117512723, MC_U117584222]",,,35,312,326,5,71,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,26-Jun,2008,453,7199,,,,,1258,U61,,10.1038/nature06956,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,318FA,WOS:000257075800047,18480754,No,Y,N,11/20/17

Despite their prevalence, their role in the evolution of cellular machinery(10,11) and the potential for their use in the design of new molecular machines(12,13), little is known about the mechanisms that drive formation of homomers at the level of evolution and assembly in the cell(9,14). Here we present an analysis of over 5,000 unique atomic structures and show that the quaternary structure of homomers is conserved in over 70% of protein pairs sharing as little as 30% sequence identity. Where quaternary structure is not conserved among the members of a protein family, a detailed investigation revealed well- defined evolutionary pathways by which proteins transit between different quaternary structure types. Furthermore, we show by perturbing subunit interfaces within complexes and by mass spectrometry analysis(15), that the ( dis) assembly pathway mimics the evolutionary pathway. These data represent a molecular analogy to Haeckel's evolutionary paradigm of embryonic development, where an intermediate in the assembly of a complex represents a form that appeared in its own evolutionary history.

Hydrogen- bonding is widely regarded as an important force in a membrane environment because of the low dielectric constant of membranes and a lack of competition from water(1-6). Indeed, polar residue substitutions are the most common disease- causing mutations in membrane proteins(6,7). Because of limited structural information and technical challenges, however, there have been few quantitative tests of hydrogen- bond strength in the context of large membrane proteins. Here we show, by using a double- mutant cycle analysis, that the average contribution of eight interhelical side- chain hydrogen- bonding interactions throughout bacteriorhodopsin is only 0.6 kcal mol(-1). In agreement with these experiments, we find that 4% of polar atoms in the non- polar core regions of membrane proteins have no hydrogen- bond partner and the lengths of buried hydrogen bonds in soluble proteins and membrane protein transmembrane regions are statistically identical. Our results indicate that most hydrogen- bond interactions in membrane proteins are only modestly stabilizing.

Inappropriate activation of these receptors is a key feature of many human cancers(3), and its reversal is an important clinical goal. A natural secreted antagonist of EGFR signalling, called Argos, was identified in Drosophila(4). We showed previously that Argos functions by directly binding ( and sequestering) growth factor ligands that activate EGFR(5). Here we describe the 1.6-angstrom resolution crystal structure of Argos bound to an EGFR ligand. Contrary to expectations(4,6), Argos contains no EGF- like domain. Instead, a trio of closely related domains ( resembling a three- finger toxin fold(7)) form a clamp- like structure around the bound EGF ligand. Although structurally unrelated to the receptor, Argos mimics EGFR by using a bipartite binding surface to entrap EGF. The individual Argos domains share unexpected structural similarities with the extracellular ligand- binding regions of transforming growth factor-beta family receptors(8). The three- domain clamp of Argos also resembles the urokinase- type plasminogen activator ( uPA) receptor, which uses a similar mechanism to engulf the EGF- like module of uPA(9). Our results indicate that undiscovered mammalian counterparts of Argos may exist among other poorly characterized structural homologues.

Unfortunately, equivalent multiplexing capabilities are largely absent in the field of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Comparable magnetic-resonance labels have generally been limited to relatively simple chemically synthesized superparamagnetic microparticles that are, to a large extent, indistinguishable from one another. Here we show how it is instead possible to use a top-down microfabrication approach to effectively encode distinguishable spectral signatures into the geometry of magnetic microstructures. Although based on different physical principles from those of optically probed nanoparticles, these geometrically defined magnetic microstructures permit a multiplexing functionality in the magnetic resonance radio-frequency spectrum that is in many ways analogous to that permitted by quantum dots in the optical spectrum. Additionally, in situ modification of particle geometries may facilitate radio-frequency probing of various local physiological variables.","[Zabow, Gary; Dodd, Stephen; Koretsky, Alan] Natl Inst Neurol Disorders & Stroke, Lab Funct & Mol Imaging, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Zabow, Gary; Moreland, John] NIST, Electromagnet Div, Boulder, CO 80305 USA","Zabow, G (reprint author), Natl Inst Neurol Disorders & Stroke, Lab Funct & Mol Imaging, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA.",zabow@boulder.nist.gov,"Koretsky, Alan/C-7940-2015","Koretsky, Alan/0000-0002-8085-4756",Intramural NIH HHS [Z01 NS003047-01],,,32,78,80,2,48,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,19-Jun,2008,453,7198,,,,,1058,U2,,10.1038/nature07048,,7,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,314WM,WOS:000256839900048,18563157,No,,,11/20/17

Accordingly, two stars born at the same time, from the same natal material and with the same mass, are 'identical twins,' and as such might be expected to possess identical physical attributes. We have discovered in the Orion nebula a pair of stellar twins in a newborn binary star system(2). Each star in the binary has a mass of 0.41 +/- 0.01 solar masses, identical to within 2 per cent. Here we report that these twin stars have surface temperatures differing by similar to 300 K (similar to 10 per cent) and luminosities differing by similar to 50 per cent, both at high confidence level. Preliminary results indicate that the stars' radii also differ, by 5 - 10 per cent. These surprising dissimilarities suggest that one of the twins may have been delayed by several hundred thousand years in its formation relative to its sibling. Such a delay could only have been detected in a very young, definitively equal-mass binary system(3).

Earth's main auroral oval is formed through interactions with the solar wind(1), whereas that at Jupiter is formed through interactions with plasma from the moon Io inside its magnetic field (although other processes form aurorae at both planets(2,3)). At Saturn, only the main auroral oval has previously been observed and there remains much debate over its origin. Here we report the discovery of a secondary oval at Saturn that is similar to 25 per cent as bright as the main oval, and we show this to be caused by interaction with the middle magnetosphere around the planet. This is a weak equivalent of Jupiter's main oval, its relative dimness being due to the lack of as large a source of ions as Jupiter's volcanic moon Io. This result suggests that differences seen in the auroral emissions from Saturn and Jupiter are due to scaling differences in the conditions at each of these two planets, whereas the underlying formation processes are the same.","[Stallard, Tom; Cowley, Stan W.

Strain is also expected to have an important role in future devices based on nanowires(6) and in optoelectronic components(7). Different strategies have been used to engineer strain in devices, leading to complex strain distributions in two and three dimensions(8,9). Developing methods of strain measurement at the nanoscale has therefore been an important objective in recent years but has proved elusive in practice(1,10): none of the existing techniques combines the necessary spatial resolution, precision and field of view. For example, Raman spectroscopy or X-ray diffraction techniques can map strain at the micrometre scale, whereas transmission electron microscopy allows strain measurement at the nanometre scale but only over small sample areas. Here we present a technique capable of bridging this gap and measuring strain to high precision, with nanometre spatial resolution and for micrometre fields of view(11). Our method combines the advantages of moire techniques(12) with the flexibility of off-axis electron holography(13) and is also applicable to relatively thick samples, thus reducing the influence of thin-film relaxation effects.","[Hytch, Martin; Houdellier, Florent; Hue, Florian; Snoeck, Etienne] nMat Grp, CEMES CNRS, F-31055 Toulouse, France","Hytch, M (reprint author), nMat Grp, CEMES CNRS, 29 Rue Jeanne Marvig, F-31055 Toulouse, France.",hytch@cemes.fr,,,,,,35,232,235,11,131,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,19-Jun,2008,453,7198,,,,,1086,U5,,10.1038/nature07049,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,314WM,WOS:000256839900053,18563161,No,Y,N,11/20/17

Climate models, however, do not reproduce the large decadal variability in globally averaged ocean heat content inferred from the sparse observational database(3,4), even when volcanic and other variable climate forcings are included. The sum of the observed contributions has also not adequately explained the overall multi-decadal rise(2). Here we report improved estimates of near-global ocean heat content and thermal expansion for the upper 300 m and 700 m of the ocean for 1950-2003, using statistical techniques that allow for sparse data coverage(5-7) and applying recent corrections(8) to reduce systematic biases in the most common ocean temperature observations(9). Our ocean warming and thermal expansion trends for 1961-2003 are about 50 per cent larger than earlier estimates but about 40 per cent smaller for 1993-2003, which is consistent with the recognition that previously estimated rates for the 1990s had a positive bias as a result of instrumental errors(8-10). On average, the decadal variability of the climate models with volcanic forcing now agrees approximately with the observations, but the modelled multi-decadal trends are smaller than observed. We add our observational estimate of upper-ocean thermal expansion to other contributions to sea-level rise and find that the sum of contributions from 1961 to 2003 is about 1.5 +/- 0.4 mm yr(-1), in good agreement with our updated estimate of near-global mean sea-level rise (using techniques established in earlier studies(6,7)) of 1.6 +/- 0.2 mm yr(-1).","[Domingues, Catia M.; Church, John A.; White, Neil J.; Wijffels, Susan E.; Barker, Paul M.; Dunn, Jeff R.] CSIRO Marine & Atmospher Res, Ctr Australian Weather & Climate Res, Hobart, Tas 7001, Australia; [Church, John A.; White, Neil J.] Antarctic Climate & Ecosyst Cooperat Res Ctr, Hobart, Tas 7001, Australia; [Gleckler, Peter J.] Lawrence Livermore Natl Lab, Program Climate Model Diag & Intercomparison, Livermore, CA 94550 USA","Domingues, CM (reprint author), CSIRO Marine & Atmospher Res, Ctr Australian Weather & Climate Res, GPO Box 1538, Hobart, Tas 7001, Australia.",catia.domingues@csiro.au,"White, Nicholas/I-4629-2012; Wijffels, Susan/I-8215-2012; White, Neil/B-2077-2013; Church, John/A-1541-2012; Jiao, Liqing/A-8821-2011; Domingues, Catia  /A-2901-2015","Church, John/0000-0002-7037-8194; Domingues, Catia  /0000-0001-5100-4595",,,,33,380,393,12,122,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,19-Jun,2008,453,7198,,,,,1090,U6,,10.1038/nature07080,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,314WM,WOS:000256839900054,18563162,No,Y,N,11/20/17

It has been known for decades that cytokinin and auxin interact to control organ regeneration in cultured tissue(1). Auxin has a critical role in root stem-cell specification in zygotic embryogenesis(2,3), but the early embryonic function of cytokinin is obscure(4-6). Here, we introduce a synthetic reporter to visualize universally cytokinin output in vivo. Notably, the first embryonic signal is detected in the hypophysis, the founder cell of the root stem-cell system. Its apical daughter cell, the precursor of the quiescent centre, maintains phosphorelay activity, whereas the basal daughter cell represses signalling output. Auxin activity levels, however, exhibit the inverse profile. Furthermore, we show that auxin antagonizes cytokinin output in the basal cell lineage by direct transcriptional activation of ARABIDOPSIS RESPONSE REGULATOR genes, ARR7 and ARR15, feedback repressors of cytokinin signalling. Loss of ARR7 and ARR15 function or ectopic cytokinin signalling in the basal cell during early embryogenesis results in a defective root stem-cell system. These results provide a molecular model of transient and antagonistic interaction between auxin and cytokinin critical for specifying the first root stem-cell niche.","[Muller, Bruno; Sheen, Jen] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Mol Biol, Massachusetts Gen Hosp,Dept Genet, Boston, MA 02114 USA","Sheen, J (reprint author), Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Mol Biol, Massachusetts Gen Hosp,Dept Genet, Boston, MA 02114 USA.",mueller@molbio.mgh.harvard.edu; sheen@molbio.mgh.harvard.edu,"Mueller, Bruno/E-9888-2017","Mueller, Bruno/0000-0003-2664-7219","NIGMS NIH HHS [R01 GM060493, R01 GM060493-08, R01 GM070567, R01 GM070567-04]",,,36,302,316,6,91,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,19-Jun,2008,453,7198,,,,,1094,U7,,10.1038/nature06943,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,314WM,WOS:000256839900055,18463635,No,Y,N,11/20/17

Cortical activity patterns have been used in the new field of brain-machine interfaces(8-11) to show how cursors on computer displays can be moved in two- and three-dimensional space(12-22). Although the ability to move a cursor can be useful in its own right, this technology could be applied to restore arm and hand function for amputees and paralysed persons. However, the use of cortical signals to control a multi-jointed prosthetic device for direct real-time interaction with the physical environment ('embodiment') has not been demonstrated. Here we describe a system that permits embodied prosthetic control; we show how monkeys (Macaca mulatta) use their motor cortical activity to control a mechanized arm replica in a self-feeding task. In addition to the three dimensions of movement, the subjects' cortical signals also proportionally controlled a gripper on the end of the arm. Owing to the physical interaction between the monkey, the robotic arm and objects in the workspace, this new task presented a higher level of difficulty than previous virtual (cursor-control) experiments. Apart from an example of simple one-dimensional control(23), previous experiments have lacked physical interaction even in cases where a robotic arm(16,19,24) or hand(20) was included in the control loop, because the subjects did not use it to interact with physical objects - an interaction that cannot be fully simulated. This demonstration of multi-degree-of-freedom embodied prosthetic control paves the way towards the development of dexterous prosthetic devices that could ultimately achieve arm and hand function at a near-natural level.","[Velliste, Meel; Schwartz, Andrew B.] Univ Pittsburgh, Sch Med, Dept Neurobiol, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA; [Perel, Sagi; Spalding, M.

Vocal production, including human speech and animal vocalization, poses a number of unique challenges for the auditory system. It is important for the auditory system to monitor external sounds continuously from the acoustic environment during speaking despite the potential for sensory masking by self-generated sounds(1). It is also essential for the auditory system to monitor feedback of one's own voice. This self-monitoring may play a part in distinguishing between self-generated or externally generated(2,3) auditory inputs and in detecting errors in our vocal production(4). Previous work in humans(5-10) and other animals(11-13) has demonstrated that the auditory cortex is largely suppressed during speaking or vocalizing. Despite the importance of self-monitoring, the underlying neural mechanisms in the mammalian brain, in particular the role of vocalization-induced suppression, remain virtually unknown. Here we show that neurons in the auditory cortex of marmoset monkeys (Callithrix jacchus) are sensitive to auditory feedback during vocal production, and that changes in the feedback alter the coding properties of these neurons. Furthermore, we found that the previously described cortical suppression during vocalization actually increased the sensitivity of these neurons to vocal feedback. This heightened sensitivity to vocal feedback suggests that these neurons may have an important role in auditory self-monitoring.","[Eliades, Steven J.; Wang, Xiaoqin] Johns Hopkins Univ, Sch Med, Lab Auditory Neurophysiol, Dept Biomed Engn, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA","Eliades, SJ (reprint author), Johns Hopkins Univ, Sch Med, Lab Auditory Neurophysiol, Dept Biomed Engn, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA.",seliades@jhu.edu; xiaoqin.wang@jhu.edu,,,,,,30,171,173,2,32,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,19-Jun,2008,453,7198,,,,,1102,U8,,10.1038/nature06910,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,314WM,WOS:000256839900057,18454135,No,,,11/20/17

The molecular and cellular pathways underlying polyQ-induced neurodegeneration are the focus of much research, and it is widely considered that toxic activities of the protein, resulting from the abnormally long polyQ tract, cause pathogenesis(2,3). Here we provide evidence for a pathogenic role of the CAG repeat RNA in polyQ toxicity using Drosophila. In a Drosophila screen for modifiers of polyQ degeneration induced by the spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3) protein ataxin-3, we isolated an upregulation allele of muscleblind (mbl), a gene implicated in the RNA toxicity of CUG expansion diseases(4-6). Further analysis indicated that there may be a toxic role of the RNA in polyQ-induced degeneration. We tested the role of the RNA by altering the CAG repeat sequence to an interrupted CAACAG repeat within the polyQ-encoding region; this dramatically mitigated toxicity. In addition, expression of an untranslated CAG repeat of pathogenic length conferred neuronal degeneration. These studies reveal a role for the RNA in polyQ toxicity, highlighting common components in RNA-based and polyQ-protein-based trinucleotide repeat expansion diseases.","[Li, Ling-Bo; Yu, Zhenming; Teng, Xiuyin; Bonini, Nancy M.] Univ Penn, Dept Biol, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Yu, Zhenming; Teng, Xiuyin; Bonini, Nancy M.] Univ Penn, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA","Bonini, NM (reprint author), Univ Penn, Dept Biol, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",nbonini@sas.upenn.edu,,,"Howard Hughes Medical Institute; NINDS NIH HHS [R01 NS043578-02, R01 NS043578, R01 NS043578-01A1, R01 NS043578-03, R01 NS043578-04, R01 NS043578-05]",,,30,174,176,1,11,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,19-Jun,2008,453,7198,,,,,1107,U9,,10.1038/nature06909,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,314WM,WOS:000256839900058,18449188,No,,,11/20/17

Identification of such targets, however, is notoriously difficult and unpredictable. Malignant cell transformation requires the cooperation of a few oncogenic mutations that cause substantial reorganization of many cell features(1) and induce complex changes in gene expression patterns(2-6). Genes critical to this multifaceted cellular phenotype have therefore only been identified after signalling pathway analysis(7-10) or on an ad hoc basis(4,11-14). Our observations that cell transformation by cooperating oncogenic lesions depends on synergistic modulation of downstream signalling circuitry(15-17) suggest that malignant transformation is a highly cooperative process, involving synergy at multiple levels of regulation, including gene expression. Here we show that a large proportion of genes controlled synergistically by loss-of-function p53 and Ras activation are critical to the malignant state of murine and human colon cells. Notably, 14 out of 24 'cooperation response genes' were found to contribute to tumour formation in gene perturbation experiments. In contrast, only 1 in 14 perturbations of the genes responding in a non-synergistic manner had a similar effect. Synergistic control of gene expression by oncogenic mutations thus emerges as an underlying key to malignancy, and provides an attractive rationale for identifying intervention targets in gene networks downstream of oncogenic gain- and loss-of-function mutations.","[McMurray, Helene R.; Sampson, Erik R.; Compitello, George; Kinsey, Conan; Newman, Laurel; Smith, Bradley; Chen, Shaw-Ree; Land, Hartmut] Univ Rochester, Med Ctr, Dept Biomed Genet, Rochester, NY 14642 USA; [Klebanov, Lev; Salzman, Peter; Yakovlev, Andrei] Univ Rochester, Med Ctr, Dept Biostat & Computat Biol, Rochester, NY 14642 USA; [Yakovlev, Andrei; Land, Hartmut] Univ Rochester, Med Ctr, James Wilmot Canc Ctr, Rochester, NY 14642 USA; [Klebanov, Lev] Charles Univ Prague, Dept Probabil & Stat, CZ-18675 Prague 8, Czech Republic","Land, H (reprint author), Univ Rochester, Med Ctr, Dept Biomed Genet, 601 Elmwood Ave, Rochester, NY 14642 USA.",land@urmc.rochester.edu,"Klebanov, Lev/C-2408-2009; Klebanov, Lev/F-3373-2014","Klebanov, Lev/0000-0001-8496-6432; McMurray, Helene/0000-0003-1738-8622","NCI NIH HHS [CA120317, CA90663, R01 CA090663, R01 CA090663-03, R01 CA090663-04, R01 CA090663-05, R01 CA120317, R01 CA120317-01A1, R01 CA120317-02, T32 CA009363, T32 CA009363-25, T32 CA09363]; NIGMS NIH HHS [GM075299, R01 GM075299, R01 GM075299-01, R01 GM075299-02, R01 GM075299-03, R01 GM075299-03S1]; NLM NIH HHS [K99 LM009477, K99 LM009477-01A1]",,,37,80,86,2,14,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,19-Jun,2008,453,7198,,,,,1112,U10,,10.1038/nature06973,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,314WM,WOS:000256839900059,18500333,No,,,11/20/17

Placental hypoxia, hypertension, proteinuria and oedema are the principal clinical features of this disease. It is speculated that hypoxia-driven disruption of the angiogenic balance involving vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)/ placenta-derived growth factor (PLGF) and soluble Fms-like tyrosine kinase-1 (sFLT-1, the soluble form of VEGF receptor 1) might contribute to some of the maternal symptoms of pre-eclampsia(1-5). However, pre-eclampsia does not develop in all women with high sFLT-1 or low PLGF levels, and it also occurs in some women with low sFLT-1 and high PLGF levels(5,6). Moreover, recent experiments strongly suggest that several soluble factors affecting the vasculature are probably elevated because of placental hypoxia in the pre-eclamptic women, indicating that upstream molecular defect(s) may contribute to pre-eclampsia. Here we show that pregnant mice deficient in catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) show a pre-eclampsia-like phenotype resulting from an absence of 2-methoxyoestradiol (2-ME), a natural metabolite of oestradiol that is elevated during the third trimester of normal human pregnancy. 2-ME ameliorates all pre-eclampsia-like features without toxicity in the Comt(-/-) pregnant mice and suppresses placental hypoxia, hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha expression and sFLT-1 elevation. The levels of COMT and 2-ME are significantly lower in women with severe pre-eclampsia. Our studies identify a genetic mouse model for pre-eclampsia and suggest that 2-ME may have utility as a plasma and urine diagnostic marker for this disease, and may also serve as a therapeutic supplement to prevent or treat this disorder.","[Kanasaki, Keizo; Palmsten, Kristin; Sugimoto, Hikaru; Hamano, Yuki; Xie, Liang; Kalluri, Raghu] Beth Israel Deaconess Med Ctr, Div Matrix Biol, Dept Med, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Kanasaki, Keizo; Palmsten, Kristin; Sugimoto, Hikaru; Hamano, Yuki; Xie, Liang; Kalluri, Raghu] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Ahmad, Shakil] Univ Birmingham, Sch Med, Dept Reprod Biol, Biomed Res Inst, Birmingham B15 2TT, W Midlands, England; [Ahmad, Shakil] Univ Birmingham, Sch Med, Dept Vasc Biol, Biomed Res Inst, Birmingham B15 2TT, W Midlands, England; [Ahmad, Shakil] Birmingham Womens Hosp, Birmingham B15 2TG, W Midlands, England; [Parry, Samuel] Univ Penn, Sch Med, Dept Obstet & Gynecol, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Augustin, Hellmut G.] Univ Heidelberg, Joint Res Div Vasc Biol, Med Fac Mannheim, D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany; [Augustin, Hellmut G.] German Canc Res Ctr, D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany; [Gattone, Vincent H., Jr.] Indiana Univ, Sch Med, Dept Anat & Cell Biol, Indianapolis, IN 46202 USA; [Folkman, Judah] Childrens Hosp, Program Vasc Biol, Dept Surg Res, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Strauss, Jerome F.] Virginia Commonwealth Univ, Sch Med, Richmond, VA 23298 USA; [Kalluri, Raghu] Harvard Mit Div Hlth Sci & Technol, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Kalluri, Raghu] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Biol Chem & Mol Pharmacol, Boston, MA 02215 USA","Kalluri, R (reprint author), Beth Israel Deaconess Med Ctr, Div Matrix Biol, Dept Med, Boston, MA 02215 USA.",rkalluri@bidmc.harvard.edu,,"Kalluri, Raghu/0000-0002-2190-547X; Ahmad, Shakil/0000-0002-9294-0475; Augustin, Hellmut/0000-0002-7173-4242","British Heart Foundation; Medical Research Council [, G0700288]; NIDDK NIH HHS [DK 13193, DK 55001, DK 61688, DK 62987, R01 DK055001, R01 DK061688]",,,33,195,207,1,20,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,19-Jun,2008,453,7198,,,,,1117,U12,,10.1038/nature06951,,7,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,314WM,WOS:000256839900060,18469803,No,,,11/20/17

Toll-like receptors are critical in sensing infections and are therefore common targets of various adjuvants used in immunological studies. Although alum is known to induce the production of proinflammatory cytokines in vitro, it has been repeatedly demonstrated that alum does not require intact Toll-like receptor signalling to activate the immune system(1,2). Here we show that aluminium adjuvants activate an intracellular innate immune response system called the Nalp3 (also known as cryopyrin, CIAS1 or NLRP3) inflammasome. Production of the pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin-1 beta and interleukin-18 by macrophages in response to alum in vitro required intact inflammasome signalling. Furthermore, in vivo, mice deficient in Nalp3, ASC (apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a caspase recruitment domain) or caspase-1 failed to mount a significant antibody response to an antigen administered with aluminium adjuvants, whereas the response to complete Freund's adjuvant remained intact. We identify the Nalp3 inflammasome as a crucial element in the adjuvant effect of aluminium adjuvants; in addition, we show that the innate inflammasome pathway can direct a humoral adaptive immune response. This is likely to affect how we design effective, but safe, adjuvants in the future.","[Eisenbarth, Stephanie C.; Colegio, Oscar R.; O'Connor, William, Jr.; Sutterwala, Fayyaz S.; Flavell, Richard A.] Yale Univ, Sch Med, Dept Immunobiol, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Eisenbarth, Stephanie C.] Yale Univ, Sch Med, Dept Lab Med, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Colegio, Oscar R.] Yale Univ, Sch Med, Dept Dermatol, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Flavell, Richard A.] Yale Univ, Sch Med, Howard Hughes Med Inst, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Sutterwala, Fayyaz S.] Univ Iowa, Dept Med, Inflammat Program, Iowa City, IA 52241 USA","Flavell, RA (reprint author), Yale Univ, Sch Med, Dept Immunobiol, 333 Cedar St, New Haven, CT 06520 USA.",richard.flavell@yale.edu,,"Eisenbarth, Stephanie/0000-0002-1244-208X",Howard Hughes Medical Institute; NIAID NIH HHS [K08 AI065517]; NIAMS NIH HHS [T32 AR007016],,,30,808,841,5,90,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,19-Jun,2008,453,7198,,,,,1122,U13,,10.1038/nature06939,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,314WM,WOS:000256839900061,18496530,No,Y,N,11/20/17

With a few exceptions, haem is synthesized by a multistep biosynthetic pathway comprising defined intermediates that are highly conserved throughout evolution(5). Despite our extensive knowledge of haem biosynthesis and degradation, the cellular pathways and molecules that mediate intracellular haem trafficking are unknown. The experimental setback in identifying haem trafficking pathways has been the inability to dissociate the highly regulated cellular synthesis and degradation of haem from intracellular trafficking events(6). Caenorhabditis elegans and related helminths are natural haem auxotrophs that acquire environmental haem for incorporation into haemoproteins, which have vertebrate orthologues(7). Here we show, by exploiting this auxotrophy to identify HRG-1 proteins in C. elegans, that these proteins are essential for haem homeostasis and normal development in worms and vertebrates. Depletion of hrg-1, or its paralogue hrg-4, in worms results in the disruption of organismal haem sensing and an abnormal response to haem analogues. HRG-1 and HRG-4 are previously unknown transmembrane proteins, which reside in distinct intracellular compartments. Transient knockdown of hrg-1 in zebrafish leads to hydrocephalus, yolk tube malformations and, most strikingly, profound defects in erythropoiesis-phenotypes that are fully rescued by worm HRG-1. Human and worm proteins localize together, and bind and transport haem, thus establishing an evolutionarily conserved function for HRG-1. These findings reveal conserved pathways for cellular haem trafficking in animals that define the model for eukaryotic haem transport. Thus, uncovering the mechanisms of haem transport in C. elegans may provide insights into human disorders of haem metabolism and reveal new drug targets for developing anthelminthics to combat worm infestations.","[Rajagopal, Abbhirami; Rao, Anita U.; Uhm, Suji; Hamza, Iqbal] Univ Maryland, Dept Anim & Avian Sci, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Rajagopal, Abbhirami; Rao, Anita U.; Hall, Caitlin; Uhm, Suji; Hamza, Iqbal] Univ Maryland, Dept Cell Biol & Mol Genet, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Amigo, Julio; Paw, Barry H.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Div Hematol, Dept Med,Brigham & Womens Hosp, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Tian, Meng; Fleming, Mark D.] Childrens Hosp, Dept Pathol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Upadhyay, Sanjeev K.; Mathew, M.

The anaphase array of microtubules that self-organize at the spindle midzone contributes to positioning the cell-division plane midway between the segregating chromosomes(1). How this signalling occurs over length scales of micrometres, from the midzone to the cell cortex, is not known. Here we examine the anaphase dynamics of protein phosphorylation by aurora B kinase, a key mitotic regulator, using fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based sensors in living HeLa cells and immunofluorescence of native aurora B substrates. Quantitative analysis of phosphorylation dynamics, using chromosome- and centromere-targeted sensors, reveals that changes are due primarily to position along the division axis rather than time. These dynamics result in the formation of a spatial phosphorylation gradient early in anaphase that is centred at the spindle midzone. This gradient depends on aurora B targeting to a subpopulation of microtubules that activate it. Aurora kinase activity organizes the targeted microtubules to generate a structure-based feedback loop.

Perturbations of dopamine signalling have been implicated in several neurological and psychiatric disorders, and in drug addiction. The actions of dopamine are mediated in part by the regulation of gene expression in the striatum, through mechanisms that are not fully understood. Here we show that drugs of abuse, as well as food reinforcement learning, promote the nuclear accumulation of 32- kDa dopamine- regulated and cyclic- AMP- regulated phosphoprotein ( DARPP- 32). This accumulation is mediated through a signalling cascade involving dopamine D1 receptors, cAMP- dependent activation of protein phosphatase- 2A, dephosphorylation of DARPP- 32 at Ser 97 and inhibition of its nuclear export. The nuclear accumulation of DARPP- 32, a potent inhibitor of protein phosphatase- 1, increases the phosphorylation of histone H3, an important component of nucleosomal response. Mutation of Ser 97 profoundly alters behavioural effects of drugs of abuse and decreases motivation for food, underlining the functional importance of this signalling cascade.","[Stipanovich, Alexandre; Valjent, Emmanuel; Matamales, Miriam; Maroteaux, Matthieu; Bertran-Gonzalez, Jesus; Brami-Cherrier, Karen; Enslen, Herve; Corbille, Anne-Gaelle; Herve, Denis; Girault, Jean-Antoine] INSERM, UMR S 839, F-75005 Paris, France; [Stipanovich, Alexandre; Valjent, Emmanuel; Matamales, Miriam; Maroteaux, Matthieu; Bertran-Gonzalez, Jesus; Brami-Cherrier, Karen; Enslen, Herve; Corbille, Anne-Gaelle; Herve, Denis; Girault, Jean-Antoine] Univ Paris 06, F-75005 Paris, France; [Stipanovich, Alexandre; Valjent, Emmanuel; Matamales, Miriam; Maroteaux, Matthieu; Bertran-Gonzalez, Jesus; Brami-Cherrier, Karen; Enslen, Herve; Corbille, Anne-Gaelle; Herve, Denis; Girault, Jean-Antoine] Inst Fer Moulin, F-75005 Paris, France; [Nishi, Akinori] Kurume Univ, Sch Med, Dept Pharmacol, Fukuoka 8300011, Japan; [Nishi, Akinori; Ahn, Jung-Hyuck; Nairn, Angus C.; Greengard, Paul] Rockefeller Univ, Mol & Cellular Neurosci Lab, New York, NY 10021 USA; [Filhol, Odile] CEA, INSERM, U873, F-38054 Grenoble, France; [Nairn, Angus C.] Yale Univ, Sch Med, Dept Psychiat, New Haven, CT 06508 USA","Girault, JA (reprint author), INSERM, UMR S 839, F-75005 Paris, France.",girault@fer-a-moulin.inserm.fr,"; Girault, Jean-Antoine/F-7518-2013; Bertran Gonzalez, J/I-9291-2014; brami-cherrier, karen/I-9263-2014; Filhol-Cochet, Odile/I-3962-2016; HERVE, Denis/E-2929-2017; Bertran-Gonzalez, J/L-1410-2017; Matamales, Miriam/J-5189-2014","Filhol, Odile/0000-0003-1964-7958; Nairn, Angus/0000-0002-7075-0195; Girault, Jean-Antoine/0000-0002-7900-1705; Bertran Gonzalez, J/0000-0002-3794-1782; brami-cherrier, karen/0000-0002-3009-3821; HERVE, Denis/0000-0003-1376-1522; Bertran-Gonzalez, J/0000-0002-3794-1782; Matamales, Miriam/0000-0001-9978-0091","NIDA NIH HHS [P01 DA010044-030002, DA10044, P01 DA010044, P01 DA010044-020002, P01 DA010044-04, P01 DA010044-040002, P01 DA010044-05, P01 DA010044-050002, P01 DA010044-06, P01 DA010044-060002, P01 DA010044-07, P01 DA010044-070002, P01 DA010044-08, P01 DA010044-080002, P01 DA010044-09, P01 DA010044-090002, P01 DA010044-10, P01 DA010044-100002, P01 DA010044-11, P01 DA010044-110005, P01 DA010044-12, P01 DA010044-120005, P01 DA010044-129002, P01 DA010044-13, P01 DA010044-130005, P01 DA010044-139002, P01 DA010044-14, P01 DA010044-140005, P01 DA010044-149002, P01 DA010044-14S1]; NIMH NIH HHS [MH74866, P50 MH074866, P50 MH074866-010001, P50 MH074866-019001, P50 MH074866-020001, P50 MH074866-029001, P50 MH074866-030001, P50 MH074866-039001, P50 MH074866-040001, P50 MH074866-049001, P50 MH074866-050001, P50 MH074866-059001]",,,44,137,139,1,9,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,12-Jun,2008,453,7197,,,,,879,U23,,10.1038/nature06994,,7,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,311WV,WOS:000256632000034,18496528,No,,,11/20/17

The heat- shock protein DegP is a protein quality control factor in the bacterial envelope that is involved in eliminating misfolded proteins and in the biogenesis of outer- membrane proteins. Here we describe the molecular mechanisms underlying the regulated protease and chaperone function of DegP from Escherichia coli. We show that binding of misfolded proteins transforms hexameric DegP into large, catalytically active 12- meric and 24- meric multimers. A structural analysis of these particles revealed that DegP represents a protein packaging device whose central compartment is adaptable to the size and concentration of substrate. Moreover, the inner cavity serves antagonistic functions. Whereas the encapsulation of folded protomers of outer- membrane proteins is protective and might allow safe transit through the periplasm, misfolded proteins are eliminated in the molecular reaction chamber. Oligomer reassembly and concomitant activation on substrate binding may also be critical in regulating other HtrA proteases implicated in protein- folding diseases.","[Krojer, Tobias; Sawa, Justyna; Clausen, Tim] Inst Mol Pathol, Res Inst Mol Pathol, A-1030 Vienna, Austria; [Schaefer, Eva; Saibil, Helen R.] Univ London Birkbeck Coll, Dept Crystallog, London WC1E 7HX, England; [Schaefer, Eva; Saibil, Helen R.] Univ London Birkbeck Coll, Inst Struct Mol Biol, London WC1E 7HX, England; [Ehrmann, Michael] Univ Duisburg Essen, Ctr Med Biotechnol, FB Biol & Geog, D-45117 Essen, Germany","Clausen, T (reprint author), Inst Mol Pathol, Res Inst Mol Pathol, Dr Bohrgasse 7, A-1030 Vienna, Austria.",clausen@imp.univie.ac.at,"Ehrmann, Michael/A-7307-2012","Ehrmann, Michael/0000-0002-1927-260X; Clausen, Tim/0000-0003-1582-6924","Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council [, BB/C516144/1, BB/C516179/1, BB/F010281/1, BBS/B/03955]; Wellcome Trust [070776, 079605]",,,55,202,209,1,30,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,12-Jun,2008,453,7197,,,,,885,U31,,10.1038/nature07004,,8,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,311WV,WOS:000256632000035,18496527,No,,,11/20/17

It is now recognized that Anderson localization is ubiquitous in wave physics(2) because it originates from the interference between multiple scattering paths. Experimentally, localization has been reported for light waves(3-7), microwaves(8,9), sound waves(10) and electron gases(11). However, there has been no direct observation of exponential spatial localization of matter waves of any type. Here we observe exponential localization of a Bose Einstein condensate released into a one- dimensional waveguide in the presence of a controlled disorder created by laser speckle(12). We operate in a regime of pure Anderson localization, that is, with weak disorder - such that localization results from many quantum reflections of low amplitude - and an atomic density low enough to render interactions negligible. We directly image the atomic density profiles as a function of time, and find that weak disorder can stop the expansion and lead to the formation of a stationary, exponentially localized wavefunction - a direct signature of Anderson localization. We extract the localization length by fitting the exponential wings of the profiles, and compare it to theoretical calculations. The power spectrum of the one- dimensional speckle potentials has a high spatial frequency cutoff, causing exponential localization to occur only when the de Broglie wavelengths of the atoms in the expanding condensate are greater than an effective mobility edge corresponding to that cutoff. In the opposite case, we find that the density profiles decay algebraically, as predicted in ref. 13. The method presented here can be extended to localization of atomic quantum gases in higher dimensions, and with controlled interactions.","[Billy, Juliette; Josse, Vincent; Zuo, Zhanchun; Bernard, Alain; Hambrecht, Ben; Lugan, Pierre; Clement, David; Sanchez-Palencia, Laurent; Bouyer, Philippe; Aspect, Alain] Ecole Polytech, CNRS, Lab Charles Fabry, Inst Opt, F-91127 Palaiseau, France; [Billy, Juliette; Josse, Vincent; Zuo, Zhanchun; Bernard, Alain; Hambrecht, Ben; Lugan, Pierre; Clement, David; Sanchez-Palencia, Laurent; Bouyer, Philippe; Aspect, Alain] Univ Paris Sud, F-91127 Palaiseau, France","Bouyer, P (reprint author), Ecole Polytech, CNRS, Lab Charles Fabry, Inst Opt, Campus Polytech,RD 128, F-91127 Palaiseau, France.",philippe.bouyer@institutoptique.fr,"Clement, David/A-1915-2009; BOUYER, Philippe/A-9823-2009; Bernard, Alain/B-6142-2012; Sanchez-Palencia, Laurent/C-5586-2012; Billy, Juliette/H-5765-2013; Josse, Vincent/M-5199-2017","Clement, David/0000-0003-1451-0610; BOUYER, Philippe/0000-0003-4458-0089; Josse, Vincent/0000-0003-1461-9747",,,,32,810,820,16,128,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,12-Jun,2008,453,7197,,,,,891,894,,10.1038/nature07000,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,311WV,WOS:000256632000036,18548065,No,Y,N,11/20/17

The phenomenon is much more general(3) and has been observed in a variety of systems, including light waves(4,5). However, Anderson localization has not been observed directly for matter waves. Owing to the high degree of control over most of the system parameters ( in particular the interaction strength), ultracold atoms offer opportunities for the study of disorder- induced localization(6). Here we use a non- interacting Bose - Einstein condensate to study Anderson localization. The experiment is performed with a one- dimensional quasi- periodic lattice - a system that features a crossover between extended and exponentially localized states, as in the case of purely random disorder in higher dimensions. Localization is clearly demonstrated through investigations of the transport properties and spatial and momentum distributions. We characterize the crossover, finding that the critical disorder strength scales with the tunnelling energy of the atoms in the lattice. This controllable system may be used to investigate the interplay of disorder and interaction ( ref. 7 and references therein), and to explore exotic quantum phases(8,9).","[Roati, Giacomo; D'Errico, Chiara; Fallani, Leonardo; Fattori, Marco; Fort, Chiara; Zaccanti, Matteo; Modugno, Giovanni; Modugno, Michele; Inguscio, Massimo] Univ Florence, LENS, I-50019 Sesto Fiorentino, Italy; [Roati, Giacomo; D'Errico, Chiara; Fallani, Leonardo; Fattori, Marco; Fort, Chiara; Zaccanti, Matteo; Modugno, Giovanni; Modugno, Michele; Inguscio, Massimo] Univ Florence, Dept Fis, I-50019 Sesto Fiorentino, Italy; [Roati, Giacomo; D'Errico, Chiara; Fallani, Leonardo; Fattori, Marco; Fort, Chiara; Zaccanti, Matteo; Modugno, Giovanni; Inguscio, Massimo] INFM CNR, I-50019 Sesto Fiorentino, Italy; [Fattori, Marco] Ctr Studi Ric E Fermi, Museo Storico Fis, I-00184 Rome, Italy; [Modugno, Michele] Univ Florence, Dipartimento Matemat Applicata, I-50139 Florence, Italy; [Modugno, Michele] Univ Trent, BEC INFM Ctr, I-38050 Trento, Italy","Inguscio, M (reprint author), Univ Florence, LENS, I-50019 Sesto Fiorentino, Italy.",inguscio@lens.unifi.it,"Modugno, Michele/A-6218-2009; Modugno, Giovanni/C-3179-2009; roati, giacomo/C-5459-2009; Zaccanti, Matteo/D-2474-2014; Fallani, Leonardo/C-5347-2008","Modugno, Michele/0000-0002-0532-1423; Modugno, Giovanni/0000-0002-4394-8593; FORT, Chiara/0000-0001-8817-3077; D'ERRICO, Chiara/0000-0003-0546-9900; Zaccanti, Matteo/0000-0001-6214-4921; Fallani, Leonardo/0000-0001-5327-3254",,,,32,780,789,7,74,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,12-Jun,2008,453,7197,,,,,895,U36,,10.1038/nature07071,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,311WV,WOS:000256632000037,18548066,No,Y,N,11/20/17

Superconductivity in the newly discovered rare- earth iron- based oxide systems ROFeAs ( R, rare- earth metal) also arises from either electron(3-7) or hole(8) doping of their non- superconducting parent compounds. The parent material LaOFeAs is metallic but shows anomalies near 150 K in both resistivity and d. c. magnetic susceptibility(3). Although optical conductivity and theoretical calculations suggest that LaOFeAs exhibits a spin- density- wave ( SDW) instability that is suppressed by doping with electrons to induce superconductivity(9), there has been no direct evidence of SDW order. Here we report neutron- scattering experiments that demonstrate that LaOFeAs undergoes an abrupt structural distortion below 155 K, changing the symmetry from tetragonal ( space group P4/ nmm) to monoclinic ( space group P112/ n) at low temperatures, and then, at similar to 137 K, develops long- range SDW- type antiferromagnetic order with a small moment but simple magnetic structure(9). Doping the system with fluorine suppresses both the magnetic order and the structural distortion in favour of superconductivity. Therefore, like high- T(c) copper oxides, the superconducting regime in these iron- based materials occurs in close proximity to a long- range- ordered antiferromagnetic ground state.","[de la Cruz, Clarina; Dai, Pengcheng] Univ Tennessee, Dept Phys & Astron, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA; [de la Cruz, Clarina; Mook, H.

This view changed when it was found that attaching the divalent carbon atom to substituents that are bulky and/ or able to donate electrons produces carbenes that can be isolated and stored(1). N- heterocyclic carbenes are such compounds now in wide use, for example as ligands in metathesis catalysis(2). In contrast, oxygen- donor- substituted carbenes are inherently less stable and have been less studied. The pre- eminent case is hydroxymethylene, H-C-OH; although it is the key intermediate in the high- energy chemistry of its tautomer formaldehyde(3-7), has been implicated since 1921 in the photocatalytic formation of carbohydrates(8), and is the parent of alkoxycarbenes that lie at the heart of transition- metal carbene chemistry, all attempts to observe this species or other alkoxycarbenes have failed(9). However, theoretical considerations indicate that hydroxymethylene should be isolatable(10). Here we report the synthesis of hydroxymethylene and its capture by matrix isolation. We unexpectedly find that H -C-OH rearranges to formaldehyde with a half- life of only 2 h at 11 K by pure hydrogen tunnelling through a large energy barrier in excess of 30 kcal mol(-1).","[Schreiner, Peter R.; Reisenauer, Hans Peter] Univ Giessen, Inst Organ Chem, D-35392 Giessen, Germany; [Pickard, Frank C.; Simmonett, Andrew C.; Allen, Wesley D.] Univ Georgia, Ctr Computat Chem, Athens, GA 30602 USA; [Pickard, Frank C.; Simmonett, Andrew C.; Allen, Wesley D.] Univ Georgia, Dept Chem, Athens, GA 30602 USA; [Matyus, Edit; Csaszar, Attila G.] Eotvos Lorand Univ, Lab Mol Spect, Inst Chem, H-1518 Budapest, Hungary","Schreiner, PR (reprint author), Univ Giessen, Inst Organ Chem, Heinrich Buff Ring 58, D-35392 Giessen, Germany.",prs@org.chemie.uni-giessen.de; wdallen@uga.edu,"Csaszar, Attila/A-5241-2009; Allen, Wesley/C-9867-2010; Schreiner, Peter Richard/A-4084-2008; Matyus, Edit/B-3668-2012","Allen, Wesley/0000-0002-4288-2297; Schreiner, Peter Richard/0000-0002-3608-5515; Matyus, Edit/0000-0001-7298-1707; Pickard, Frank/0000-0002-9608-3466",,,,57,148,149,5,80,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,12-Jun,2008,453,7197,,,,,906,U42,,10.1038/nature07010,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,311WV,WOS:000256632000040,18548067,No,,,11/20/17

In the prevailing model for the complex's mineralization, the radiogenic strontium and osmium isotope signatures of Bushveld PGE ores are attributed to continental crustal contamination of the host magmas(5-11). The scale of the intrusion and lateral homogeneity of the PGE- enriched layers(1), however, have long been problematical for the crustal contamination model, given the typically heterogeneous nature of continental crust. Furthermore, the distribution of Bushveld magmatism matches that of seismically anomalous underlying mantle(3,12), implying significant interaction before emplacement in the crust. Mineral samples of the ancient 200- km- deep craton keel, encapsulated in macrodiamonds and entrained by proximal kimberlites, reveal the nature of continental mantle potentially incorporated by Bushveld magmas(13,14). Here we show that sulphide inclusions in 2- billion- year- old diamonds from the 0.5- billion- year- old Venetia and 1.2- billion- year- old Premier kimberlites ( on opposite sides of the complex) have initial osmium isotope ratios even more radiogenic than those of Bushveld sulphide ore minerals(6,15). Sulphide Re - Os and silicate Sm - Nd and Rb - Sr isotope compositions indicate that continental mantle harzburgite and eclogite components, in addition to the original convecting mantle magma, most probably contributed to the genesis of both the diamonds and the Bushveld complex. Coeval diamonds provide key evidence that the main source of Bushveld PGEs is the mantle rather than the crust.","[Richardson, Stephen H.] Univ Cape Town, Dept Geol Sci, ZA-7701 Rondebosch, South Africa; [Shirey, Steven B.] Carnegie Inst Sci, Dept Terr Magnetism, Washington, DC 20015 USA","Richardson, SH (reprint author), Univ Cape Town, Dept Geol Sci, ZA-7701 Rondebosch, South Africa.",steve.richardson@uct.ac.za,,,,,,33,62,64,1,27,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,12-Jun,2008,453,7197,,,,,910,913,,10.1038/nature07073,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,311WV,WOS:000256632000041,18548068,No,,,11/20/17

Females are typically silent, but in a few anuran species they can produce a feeble reciprocal call(3) or rapping sounds(4) during courtship. Males of concave- eared torrent frogs ( Odorrana tormota) have demonstrated ultrasonic communication capacity(5). Although females of O. tormota have an unusually well- developed vocal production system(6), it is unclear whether or not they produce calls or are only passive partners in a communication system dominated by males. Here we show that before ovulation, gravid females of O. tormota emit calls that are distinct from males' advertisement calls, having higher fundamental frequencies and harmonics and shorter call duration. In the field and in a quiet, darkened indoor arena, these female calls evoke vocalizations and extraordinarily precise positive phonotaxis ( a localization error of <1 degrees), rivalling that of vertebrates with the highest localization acuity ( barn owls(7,8), dolphins, elephants and humans(9)). The localization accuracy of O. tormota is remarkable in light of their small head size ( interaural distance of <1 cm), and suggests an additional selective advantage of high- frequency hearing beyond the ability to avoid masking by low- frequency background noise(5).","[Shen, Jun-Xian; Xu, Zhi-Min; Yu, Zu-Lin] Chinese Acad Sci, State Key Lab Brain & Cognit Sci, Inst Biophys, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Feng, Albert S.] Univ Illinois, Dept Mol & Integrat Physiol, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Feng, Albert S.] Univ Illinois, Beckman Inst, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Arch, Victoria S.; Narins, Peter M.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Ecol & Evolut Biol, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Narins, Peter M.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Physiol Sci, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Yu, Xin-Jian] Chinese Acad Sci, Shanghai Inst Biol Sci, Shanghai 200032, Peoples R China","Shen, JX (reprint author), Chinese Acad Sci, State Key Lab Brain & Cognit Sci, Inst Biophys, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China.",shenjx@sun5.ibp.ac.cn,"YU, ZULIN/D-7979-2012",,,,,25,49,62,1,38,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,12-Jun,2008,453,7197,,,,,914,U46,,10.1038/nature06719,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,311WV,WOS:000256632000042,18469804,No,,,11/20/17

It shows that people's tendency to select the safer of two prospects increases when this prospect provides a good outcome with certainty ( for example, people prefer a monetary gain of 3 with certainty over 4 with a probability of 0.8, but do not prefer 3 with a probability of 0.25 over 4 with a probability of 0.2). Subsequent work on experience- based decision making in rats(7) extended the certainty effect to other animals, suggesting its generality across different species and different decision- making mechanisms. However, an attempt to replicate this study with human subjects showed a surprising 'reversed certainty effect'(8,9), namely, the tendency to prefer the safer option decreases when this prospect is associated with certainty ( and people now prefer 4 with a probability of 0.8 over 3 with certainty). Here we show that these conflicting results can be explained by perceptual noise and that the certainty effect can be restored experimentally by reducing perceptual accuracy. Using complementary experiments in humans and honeybees ( Apis mellifera), we show that by manipulating perceptual accuracy in experience-based tasks, both the certainty and the reversed certainty effects can be exhibited by humans and other animals: the certainty effect emerges when it is difficult to discriminate between the different rewards, whereas the reversed certainty effect emerges when discrimination is easy. Our results fit a simple process- based model of matching behaviour(10,11), capable of explaining the certainty effect in humans and other animals that make repeated decisions based on experience. This mechanism should probably be distinguished from those involved in the original certainty effect that was exhibited by human subjects in single description- based problems(1,2).","[Lotem, Arnon] Tel Aviv Univ, Dept Zool, Fac Life Sci, IL-69978 Tel Aviv, Israel; [Shafir, Sharoni; Tsur, Erez] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, B Triwaks Bee Res Ctr, Dept Entomol, Fac Agr Food & Environm Qual Sci, IL-76100 Rehovot, Israel; [Reich, Taly; Erev, Ido] Technion Israel Inst Technol, Max Wertheimer Minerva Ctr Cognit Studies, Fac Ind Engn & Management, IL-32000 Haifa, Israel","Lotem, A (reprint author), Tel Aviv Univ, Dept Zool, Fac Life Sci, IL-69978 Tel Aviv, Israel.",erev@techunix.technion.ac.il; lotem@post.tau.ac.il,"Shafir, Sharoni/D-9821-2011","Shafir, Sharoni/0000-0002-9068-1078",,,,22,47,47,0,29,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,12-Jun,2008,453,7197,,,,,917,U51,,10.1038/nature06841,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,311WV,WOS:000256632000043,18548069,No,,,11/20/17

Huntington's disease ( HD) is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disorder characterized by motor impairment, cognitive deterioration and psychiatric disturbances followed by death within 10 - 15 years of the onset of the symptoms(1-4). HD is caused by the expansion of cytosine-adenine-guanine ( CAG, translated into glutamine) trinucleotide repeats in the first exon of the human huntingtin ( HTT) gene(5). Mutant HTT with expanded polyglutamine ( polyQ) is widely expressed in the brain and peripheral tissues(2,6), but causes selective neurodegeneration that is most prominent in the striatum and cortex of the brain. Although rodent models of HD have been developed, these models do not satisfactorily parallel the brain changes and behavioural features observed in HD patients. Because of the close physiological(7), neurological and genetic similarities(8,9) between humans and higher primates, monkeys can serve as very useful models for understanding human physiology and diseases(10,11). Here we report our progress in developing a transgenic model of HD in a rhesus macaque that expresses polyglutamine- expanded HTT. Hallmark features of HD, including nuclear inclusions and neuropil aggregates, were observed in the brains of the HD transgenic monkeys. Additionally, the transgenic monkeys showed important clinical features of HD, including dystonia and chorea. A transgenic HD monkey model may open the way to understanding the underlying biology of HD better, and to the development of potential therapies. Moreover, our data suggest that it will be feasible to generate valuable non-human primate models of HD and possibly other human genetic diseases.","[Yang, Shang-Hsun; Cheng, Pei-Hsun; Banta, Heather; Piotrowska-Nitsche, Karolina; Yang, Jin-Jing; Cheng, Eric C.

To identify the target of these agents we developed biotinylated photo-activatable GSMs. GSM photoprobes did not label the core proteins of the gamma- secretase complex, but instead labelled the beta- amyloid precursor protein ( APP), APP carboxy- terminal fragments and amyloid-beta peptide in human neuroglioma H4 cells. Substrate labelling was competed by other GSMs, and labelling of an APP gamma- secretase substrate was more efficient than a Notch substrate. GSM interaction was localized to residues 28 - 36 of amyloid-beta, a region critical for aggregation. We also demonstrate that compounds known to interact with this region of amyloid- beta act as GSMs, and some GSMs alter the production of cell- derived amyloid- beta oligomers. Furthermore, mutation of the GSM binding site in the APP alters the sensitivity of the substrate to GSMs. These findings indicate that substrate targeting by GSMs mechanistically links two therapeutic actions: alteration in A beta 42 production and inhibition of amyloid- beta aggregation, which may synergistically reduce amyloid- beta deposition in Alzheimer's disease. These data also demonstrate the existence and feasibility of 'substrate targeting' by small- molecule effectors of proteolytic enzymes, which if generally applicable may significantly broaden the current notion of 'druggable' targets(2).","[Kukar, Thomas L.; Ladd, Thomas B.; Bann, Maralyssa A.; Maharvi, Ghulam M.; Healy, Brent; Chapman, Robert; Price, Robert W.; Moore, Brenda; Rangachari, Vijayaraghavan; Cusack, Bernadette; Eriksen, Jason; Jansen-West, Karen; Verbeeck, Christophe; Yager, Debra; Eckman, Christopher; Rosenberry, Terrone L.; Fauq, Abdul; Golde, Todd E.] Mayo Clin, Coll Med, Dept Neurosci, Jacksonville, FL 32224 USA; [Fraering, Patrick C.] Ecole Polytech Fed Lausanne, Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Brain Mind Inst, CH-1025 Lausanne, Switzerland; [Fraering, Patrick C.] Ecole Polytech Fed Lausanne, Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Sch Life Sci, CH-1025 Lausanne, Switzerland; [Fraering, Patrick C.; Ye, Wenjuan; Wolfe, Michael S.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Ctr Neurol Dis, Brigham & Womens Hosp, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Narlawar, Rajeshwar; Schmidt, Boris] Tech Univ Darmstadt, Clemens Schopf Inst Chem & Biochem, D-64287 Darmstadt, Germany; [Welzel, Alfred T.; Walsh, Dominic M.] Univ Coll Dublin, Lab Neurodegenerat Res, Conway Inst, Dublin 4, Ireland; [Sagi, Sarah; Cottrell, Barbara A.; Torpey, Justin; Koo, Edward H.] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Neurosci, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA","Kukar, TL (reprint author), Mayo Clin, Coll Med, Dept Neurosci, 4500 San Pablo Rd, Jacksonville, FL 32224 USA.",kukar.thomas@mayo.edu; golde.todd@mayo.edu,"Narlawar, Rajeshwar/E-4981-2010; Cusack, Bernadette/D-4606-2013; Schmidt, Boris/D-3293-2009; Rangachari, vijay/K-1420-2015; Eriksen, Jason/A-8054-2008","Kukar, Thomas/0000-0002-3750-6262; Schmidt, Boris/0000-0003-1662-2392; Eriksen, Jason/0000-0003-1549-4165","NIA NIH HHS [R01 AG017574-08, P01 AG020206, P01 AG020206-010002, R01 AG017574, R01 AG017574-09]; NINDS NIH HHS [R01 NS041355, R01 NS041355-06A2, R01 NS041355-07]",,,32,224,231,4,49,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,12-Jun,2008,453,7197,,,,,925,U62,,10.1038/nature07055,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,311WV,WOS:000256632000045,18548070,No,,,11/20/17

It does so by triggering the differentiation of Sertoli cells from supporting cell precursors, which would otherwise give follicle cells. The related autosomal gene Sox9 is also known from loss- of- function mutations in mice and humans to be essential for Sertoli cell differentiation(4,5); moreover, its abnormal expression in an XX gonad can lead to male development in the absence of Sry(6,7). These genetic data, together with the finding that Sox9 is upregulated in Sertoli cell precursors just after SRY expression begins(8,9), has led to the proposal that Sox9 could be directly regulated by SRY. However, the mechanism by which SRY action might affect Sox9 expression was not understood. Here we show that SRY binds to multiple elements within a Sox9 gonad- specific enhancer in mice, and that it does so along with steroidogenic factor 1 ( SF1, encoded by the gene Nr5a1 ( Sf1)), an orphan nuclear receptor. Mutation, co- transfection and sex-reversal studies all point to a feedforward, self- reinforcing pathway in which SF1 and SRY cooperatively upregulate Sox9 and then, together with SF1, SOX9 also binds to the enhancer to help maintain its own expression after that of SRY has ceased. Our results open up the field, permitting further characterization of the molecular mechanisms regulating sex determination and how they have evolved, as well as how they fail in cases of sex reversal.","[Sekido, Ryohei; Lovell-Badge, Robin] Natl Inst Med Res, MRC, Div Dev Genet, London NW7 1AA, England","Sekido, R (reprint author), Natl Inst Med Res, MRC, Div Dev Genet, Ridgeway,Mill Hill, London NW7 1AA, England.",rsekido@nimr.mrc.ac.uk; rlovell@nimr.mrc.ac.uk,,,"Medical Research Council [, MC_U117562207]",,,30,441,454,5,42,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,12-Jun,2008,453,7197,,,,,930,934,,10.1038/nature06944,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,311WV,WOS:000256632000046,18454134,No,,,11/20/17

An important component is the Caenorhabditis elegans engulfment receptor CED- 1 ( ref. 1) and its Drosophila orthologue, Draper(2). The CED- 1/ Draper signalling pathway is also essential for the phagocytosis of other types of 'modified self' including necrotic cells(3), developmentally pruned axons(4,5) and dendrites(6), and axons undergoing Wallerian degeneration(7). Here we show that Drosophila Shark, a non- receptor tyrosine kinase similar to mammalian Syk and Zap- 70, binds Draper through an immunoreceptor tyrosine- based activation motif ( ITAM) in the Draper intracellular domain. We show that Shark activity is essential for Draper-mediated signalling events in vivo, including the recruitment of glial membranes to severed axons and the phagocytosis of axonal debris and neuronal cell corpses by glia. We also show that the Src family kinase ( SFK) Src42A can markedly increase Draper phosphorylation and is essential for glial phagocytic activity. We propose that ligand- dependent Draper receptor activation initiates the Src42A- dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of Draper, the association of Shark and the activation of the Draper pathway. These Draper - Src42A - Shark interactions are strikingly similar to mammalian immunoreceptor - SFK - Syk signalling events in mammalian myeloid and lymphoid cells(8,9). Thus, Draper seems to be an ancient immunoreceptor with an extracellular domain tuned to modified self, and an intracellular domain promoting phagocytosis through an ITAM- domain - SFK - Syk- mediated signalling cascade.","[Ziegenfuss, Jennifer S.; Avery, Michelle A.; Sheehan, Amy E.; Freeman, Marc R.] Univ Massachusetts, Sch Med, Dept Neurobiol, Worcester, MA 01605 USA; [Biswas, Romi; Hong, Kyoungja; Yeung, Yee-Guide; Stanley, E.

Given that bicarbonate is an endogenous molecule that can be infused in relatively high concentrations into patients(4), we propose that this technique could be used clinically to image pathological processes that are associated with alterations in tissue pH, such as cancer, ischaemia and inflammation.","[Gallagher, Ferdia A.; Kettunen, Mikko I.; Day, Sam E.; Hu, De-En; Brindle, Kevin M.] Canc Res UK, Cambridge Res Inst, Li Ka Shing Ctr, Cambridge CB2 0RE, England; [Gallagher, Ferdia A.; Kettunen, Mikko I.; Day, Sam E.; Hu, De-En; Brindle, Kevin M.] Univ Cambridge, Dept Biochem, Cambridge CB2 1GA, England; [Gallagher, Ferdia A.] Univ Cambridge, Addenbrookes Hosp, Dept Radiol, Cambridge CB2 2QQ, England; [Ardenkjaer-Larsen, Jan Henrik] GE Healthcare, Grove Ctr GC 18, Amersham HP7 9LL, England; [in't Zandt, Rene; Jensen, Pernille R.; Karlsson, Magnus; Golman, Klaes; Lerche, Mathilde H.] Imagnia AB, SE-20041 Malmo, Sweden","Brindle, KM (reprint author), Canc Res UK, Cambridge Res Inst, Li Ka Shing Ctr, Robinson Way, Cambridge CB2 0RE, England.",kmb@mole.bio.cam.ac.uk,"Kettunen, Mikko/K-2299-2012; Jensen, Pernille Rose/J-8648-2016; Ardenkjar-Larsen, Jan Henrik/B-5765-2017","Kettunen, Mikko/0000-0002-2004-660X; Jensen, Pernille Rose/0000-0003-4359-848X; Ardenkjar-Larsen, Jan Henrik/0000-0001-6167-6926; Gallagher, Ferdia Aidan/0000-0003-4784-5230; Karlsson, Magnus/0000-0001-7738-1700; Lerche, Mathilde Hauge/0000-0002-5899-2781",Cancer Research UK [C197/A3514],,,30,412,417,9,136,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,12-Jun,2008,453,7197,,,,,940,U73,,10.1038/nature07017,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,311WV,WOS:000256632000048,18509335,No,Y,N,11/20/17

Genomic analyses of the localization and expression dynamics of transcription factors suggest that a network of sequentially expressed transcription factors could control the temporal programme of transcription during the cell cycle(3). However, directed studies interrogating small numbers of genes indicate that their periodic transcription is governed by the activity of cyclin- dependent kinases (CDKs)(4). To determine the extent to which the global cell- cycle transcription programme is controlled by cyclin - CDK complexes, we examined genome- wide transcription dynamics in budding yeast mutant cells that do not express S- phase and mitotic cyclins. Here we show that a significant fraction of periodic genes are aberrantly expressed in the cyclin mutant. Although cells lacking cyclins are blocked at the G1/S border, nearly 70% of periodic genes continued to be expressed periodically and on schedule. Our findings reveal that although CDKs have a function in the regulation of cell- cycle transcription, they are not solely responsible for establishing the global periodic transcription programme. We propose that periodic transcription is an emergent property of a transcription factor network that can function as a cell- cycle oscillator independently of, and in tandem with, the CDK oscillator.","[Orlando, David A.; Lin, Charles Y.; Wang, Jean Y.; Haase, Steven B.] Duke Univ, Dept Biol, Durham, NC 27708 USA; [Orlando, David A.] Duke Univ, Program Computat Biol & Bioinformat, Durham, NC 27708 USA; [Bernard, Allister; Hartemink, Alexander J.] Duke Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Durham, NC 27708 USA; [Socolar, Joshua E.

Microscopy studies have indicated that specific regions of chromosomes are located in close proximity to the nuclear lamina (NL)(1-3). This has led to the idea that certain genomic elements may be attached to the NL, which may contribute to the spatial organization of chromosomes inside the nucleus. However, sequences in the human genome that interact with the NL in vivo have not been identified. Here we construct a high-resolution map of the interaction sites of the entire genome with NL components in human fibroblasts. This map shows that genome - lamina interactions occur through more than 1,300 sharply defined large domains 0.1 - 10 megabases in size. These lamina-associated domains ( LADs) are typified by low gene- expression levels, indicating that LADs represent a repressive chromatin environment. The borders of LADs are demarcated by the insulator protein CTCF, by promoters that are oriented away from LADs, or by CpG islands, suggesting possible mechanisms of LAD confinement. Taken together, these results demonstrate that the human genome is divided into large, discrete domains that are units of chromosome organization within the nucleus.","[Guelen, Lars; Pagie, Ludo; Meuleman, Wouter; Faza, Marius B.; Talhout, Wendy; Wessels, Lodewyk; van Steensel, Bas] Netherlands Canc Inst, Div Mol Biol, NL-1066 CX Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Brasset, Emilie; de Laat, Wouter] Erasmus MC, Dept Cell Biol & Genet, NL-3000 CA Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Eussen, Bert H.; de Klein, Annelies] Erasmus MC, Dept Clin Genet, NL-3000 CA Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Meuleman, Wouter; Wessels, Lodewyk] Delft Univ Technol, Fac Elect Engn Math & Comp Sci, NL-2628 CD Delft, Netherlands","van Steensel, B (reprint author), Netherlands Canc Inst, Div Mol Biol, Plesmanlaan 121, NL-1066 CX Amsterdam, Netherlands.",b.v.steensel@nki.nl,"Brasset, Emilie/J-6684-2015","Meuleman, Wouter/0000-0002-1196-5401",,,,35,780,793,3,55,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,12-Jun,2008,453,7197,,,,,948,U83,,10.1038/nature06947,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,311WV,WOS:000256632000050,18463634,No,Y,N,11/20/17

Here we report direct evidence of moonlets embedded in the ring's bright core, and show that most of the F ring's morphology results from the continual gravitational and collisional effects of small satellites, often combined with the perturbing effect of Prometheus.

How such trees are generated during development, and how the developmental patterning information is encoded, have long fascinated biologists and mathematicians. However, models have been limited by a lack of information on the normal sequence and pattern of branching events. Here we present the complete three- dimensional branching pattern and lineage of the mouse bronchial tree, reconstructed from an analysis of hundreds of developmental intermediates. The branching process is remarkably stereotyped and elegant: the tree is generated by three geometrically simple local modes of branching used in three different orders throughout the lung. We propose that each mode of branching is controlled by a genetically encoded subroutine, a series of local patterning and morphogenesis operations, which are themselves controlled by a more global master routine. We show that this hierarchical and modular programme is genetically tractable, and it is ideally suited to encoding and evolving the complex networks of the lung and other branched organs.","[Metzger, Ross J.; Krasnow, Mark A.] Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Dept Biochem, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Metzger, Ross J.; Krasnow, Mark A.] Stanford Univ, Sch Med, HHMI, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Metzger, Ross J.; Klein, Ophir D.; Martin, Gail R.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Sch Med, Dept Anat, San Francisco, CA 94158 USA; [Klein, Ophir D.; Martin, Gail R.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Sch Med, Program Dev Biol, San Francisco, CA 94158 USA","Metzger, RJ (reprint author), Univ Calif San Francisco, Sch Med, Dept Anat, San Francisco, CA 94158 USA.",ross.metzger@ucsf.edu; krasnow@cmgm.stanford.edu,,"Klein, Ophir/0000-0002-6254-7082","Howard Hughes Medical Institute; NCI NIH HHS [R01 CA078711, R01 CA078711-02, R01 CA078711-03, R01 CA078711-04, R01 CA078711-05]; NHLBI NIH HHS [R01 HL075769-01, R01 HL075769, R01 HL075769-02, R01 HL075769-03, R01 HL075769-04]",,,42,326,329,3,41,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,5-Jun,2008,453,7196,,,,,745,U1,,10.1038/nature07005,,7,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,308UK,WOS:000256415300035,18463632,No,,,11/20/17

Tissue stability requires intercellular adhesion mediated by E- cadherin, in particular its trans- association in homophilic complexes supported by actin filaments through beta- and alpha- catenin. How alpha- catenin dynamic interactions between E- cadherin/ beta- catenin and cortical actin control both stability and remodelling of adhesion is unclear. Here we focus on Drosophila homophilic E- cadherin complexes rather than total E- cadherin, including diffusing 'free' E- cadherin, because these complexes are a better proxy for adhesion. We find that E- cadherin complexes partition in very stable microdomains ( that is, bona fide adhesive foci which are more stable than remodelling contacts). Furthermore, we find that stability and mobility of these microdomains depend on two actin populations: small, stable actin patches concentrate at homophilic E- cadherin clusters, whereas a rapidly turning over, contractile network constrains their lateral movement by a tethering mechanism. alpha- Catenin controls epithelial architecture mainly through regulation of the mobility of homophilic clusters and it is largely dispensable for their stability. Uncoupling stability and mobility of E- cadherin complexes suggests that stable epithelia may remodel through the regulated mobility of very stable adhesive foci.","[Cavey, Matthieu; Rauzi, Matteo; Lecuit, Thomas] Univ Aix Marseille 2, CNRS, Inst Biol Dev Marseille Luminy, UMR 6216, F-13288 Marseille 09, France; [Rauzi, Matteo; Lenne, Pierre-Francois] Univ Aix Marseille 3, CNRS, Inst Fresnel, UMR 6133, F-13397 Marseille 20, France","Lecuit, T (reprint author), Univ Aix Marseille 2, CNRS, Inst Biol Dev Marseille Luminy, UMR 6216, Campus Luminy Case 907, F-13288 Marseille 09, France.",lenne@fresnel.fr; lecuit@ibdm.univ-mrs.fr,"Ladoux, Benoit/A-9879-2013","Lenne, Pierre-Francois/0000-0003-1066-7506",,,,42,247,250,2,30,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,5-Jun,2008,453,7196,,,,,751,U2,,10.1038/nature06953,,7,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,308UK,WOS:000256415300036,18480755,No,,,11/20/17

This nonlinear conversion process requires high pulse intensities, greater than 10(13) W cm(-2), which are not directly attainable using only the output power of a femtosecond oscillator. Chirped- pulse amplification enables the pulse intensity to exceed this threshold by incorporating several regenerative and/ or multi- pass amplifier cavities in tandem(4,5). Intracavity pulse amplification ( designed not to reduce the pulse repetition rate) also requires a long cavity(6,7). Here we demonstrate a method of high- harmonic generation that requires no extra cavities. This is achieved by exploiting the local field enhancement induced by resonant plasmons within a metallic nanostructure consisting of bow- tie- shaped gold elements on a sapphire substrate. In our experiment, the output beam emitted from a modest femtosecond oscillator ( 100- kW peak power, 1.3- nJ pulse energy and 10- fs pulse duration) is directly focused onto the nanostructure with a pulse intensity of only 10(11) W cm(-2). The enhancement factor exceeds 20 dB, which is sufficient to produce EUV wavelengths down to 47 nm by injection with an argon gas jet.

We find a transient molybdenum isotope signal immediately after the Precambrian/ Cambrian transition. Using a box model of the oceanic molybdenum cycle, we find that intense upwelling of hydrogen sulphide- rich deep ocean water best explains the observed Early Cambrian molybdenum isotope signal.

Their significance, however, remains uncertain, as a relationship to ice flow has not been confirmed by direct observation. Here we combine long- period surface- wave observations with simultaneous Global Positioning System measurements of ice displacement to study the tidally modulated stick - slip motion of the Whillans Ice Stream in West Antarctica(4,5). The seismic origin time corresponds to slip nucleation at a region of the bed of the Whillans Ice Stream that is likely stronger than in surrounding regions and, thus, acts like an 'asperity' in traditional fault models. In addition to the initial pulse, two seismic arrivals occurring 10 - 23 minutes later represent stopping phases as the slip terminates at the ice stream edge and the grounding line. Seismic amplitude and average rupture velocity are correlated with tidal amplitude for the different slip events during the spring- to- neap tidal cycle. Although the total seismic moment calculated from ice rigidity, slip displacement, and rupture area is equivalent to an earthquake of moment magnitude seven ( M-w 7), seismic amplitudes are modest ( M-s 3.6 - 4.2), owing to the source duration of 20 - 30 minutes. Seismic radiation from ice movement is proportional to the derivative of the moment rate function at periods of 25 - 100 seconds and very long- period radiation is not detected, owing to the source geometry. Long- period seismic waves are thus useful for detecting and studying sudden ice movements but are insensitive to the total amount of slip.","[Wiens, Douglas A.] Washington Univ, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, St Louis, MO 63130 USA; [Anandakrishnan, Sridhar; Winberry, J.

As a consequence, most of the shape- traits observed across species do vary quantitatively rather than qualitatively(2), in a multivariate space(3) and in a modularized way(4,5). Because most phylogenetic analyses normally use discrete, hypothetically independent characters(6), previous attempts have disregarded the phylogenetic signals potentially enclosed in the shape of morphological structures. When analysing low taxonomic levels, where most variation is quantitative in nature, solving basic requirements like the choice of characters and the capacity of using continuous, integrated traits is of crucial importance in recovering wider phylogenetic information. This is particularly relevant when analysing extinct lineages, where available data are limited to fossilized structures. Here we show that when continuous, multivariant and modularized characters are treated as such, cladistic analysis successfully solves relationships among main Homo taxa. Our attempt is based on a combination of cladistics, evolutionary- development- derived selection of characters, and geometric morphometrics methods. In contrast with previous cladistic analyses of hominid phylogeny, our method accounts for the quantitative nature of the traits, and respects their morphological integration patterns. Because complex phenotypes are observable across different taxonomic groups and are potentially informative about phylogenetic relationships, future analyses should point strongly to the incorporation of these types of trait.","[Gonzalez-Jose, Rolando] Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn, Unidad Invest Divers Sistemat & Evoluc, Ctr Nacl Patagonico, Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn, Puerto Madryn, Argentina; [Escapa, Ignacio; Cuneo, Ruben] Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn, Museo Paleontol Egidio Feruglio, Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn, Trelew, Argentina; [Neves, Walter A.] Univ Sao Paulo, Lab Estud Evolut Humanos, Dept Genet & Biol Evolut, Inst Biociencias, BR-05422970 Sao Paulo, Brazil; [Pucciarelli, Hector M.] Natl Univ La Plata, Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn, CONICET, Dept Cientifico Antropol Museo La Plata, RA-1900 La Plata, Argentina","Gonzalez-Jose, R (reprint author), Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn, Unidad Invest Divers Sistemat & Evoluc, Ctr Nacl Patagonico, Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn, Blvd Brown 2825,U9120ACF, Puerto Madryn, Argentina.",rolando@cenpat.edu.ar,"Rohlf, F/A-8710-2008; Neves, Walter/Q-8316-2016","Neves, Walter/0000-0001-9124-3937; Escapa, Ignacio/0000-0002-7042-7750",,,,31,57,64,1,26,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,5-Jun,2008,453,7196,,,,,775,U4,,10.1038/nature06891,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,308UK,WOS:000256415300042,18454137,No,,,11/20/17

We find that, in contrast with the random trajectories predicted by the prevailing Levy flight and random walk models(7), human trajectories show a high degree of temporal and spatial regularity, each individual being characterized by a time-independent characteristic travel distance and a significant probability to return to a few highly frequented locations. After correcting for differences in travel distances and the inherent anisotropy of each trajectory, the individual travel patterns collapse into a single spatial probability distribution, indicating that, despite the diversity of their travel history, humans follow simple reproducible patterns. This inherent similarity in travel patterns could impact all phenomena driven by human mobility, from epidemic prevention to emergency response, urban planning and agent- based modelling.","[Gonzalez, Marta C.; Hidalgo, Cesar A.; Barabasi, Albert-Laszlo] Northeastern Univ, Ctr Complex Network Res, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Gonzalez, Marta C.; Hidalgo, Cesar A.; Barabasi, Albert-Laszlo] Northeastern Univ, Dept Phys Biol & Comp Sci, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Hidalgo, Cesar A.; Barabasi, Albert-Laszlo] Univ Notre Dame, Ctr Complex Network Res, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA; [Hidalgo, Cesar A.; Barabasi, Albert-Laszlo] Univ Notre Dame, Dept Phys & Comp Sci, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA; [Barabasi, Albert-Laszlo] Dana Farber Canc Inst, Ctr Canc Syst Biol, Boston, MA 02115 USA","Barabasi, AL (reprint author), Northeastern Univ, Ctr Complex Network Res, Boston, MA 02115 USA.",alb@neu.edu,"Hidalgo, Cesar/B-5155-2009; Gonzalez, Marta/E-9456-2011","Gonzalez, Marta/0000-0002-8482-0318; /0000-0002-6031-5982",,,,30,1733,1816,60,461,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,5-Jun,2008,453,7196,,,,,779,782,,10.1038/nature06958,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,308UK,WOS:000256415300043,18528393,No,Y,N,11/20/17

Owing to the increase in obesity, life expectancy may start to decrease in developed countries for the first time in recent history(3). The factors determining fat mass in adult humans are not fully understood, but increased lipid storage in already developed fat cells ( adipocytes) is thought to be most important(4,5). Here we show that adipocyte number is a major determinant for the fat mass in adults. However, the number of fat cells stays constant in adulthood in lean and obese individuals, even after marked weight loss, indicating that the number of adipocytes is set during childhood and adolescence. To establish the dynamics within the stable population of adipocytes in adults, we have measured adipocyte turnover by analysing the integration of C-14 derived from nuclear bomb tests in genomic DNA(6). Approximately 10% of fat cells are renewed annually at all adult ages and levels of body mass index. Neither adipocyte death nor generation rate is altered in early onset obesity, suggesting a tight regulation of fat cell number in this condition during adulthood. The high turnover of adipocytes establishes a new therapeutic target for pharmacological intervention in obesity.","[Spalding, Kirsty L.; Arner, Erik; Bergmann, Olaf; Frisen, Jonas] Karolinska Inst, Dept Cell & Mol Biol, SE-17177 Stockholm, Sweden; [Westermark, Pal O.] Humboldt Univ, ITB, D-10115 Berlin, Germany; [Westermark, Pal O.] Charite, D-10115 Berlin, Germany; [Bernard, Samuel] Fdn Res & Technol, Inst Appl & Computat Math, Iraklion 71110, Greece; [Buchholz, Bruce A.] Lawrence Livermore Natl Lab, Ctr Accelerator Mass Spectrometry, Livermore, CA 94551 USA; [Blomqvist, Lennart; Hoffstedt, Johan; Concha, Hernan; Hassan, Moustapha; Ryden, Mikael; Arner, Peter] Karolinska Univ Hosp, Dept Med, SE-14186 Stockholm, Sweden; [Naslund, Erik] Karolinska Inst, Div Surg, Dept Clin Sci, Danderyd Hosp, SE-18288 Stockholm, Sweden; [Britton, Tom] Stockholm Univ, Dept Math, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden","Spalding, KL (reprint author), Karolinska Inst, Dept Cell & Mol Biol, SE-17177 Stockholm, Sweden.",kirsty.spalding@ki.se; jonas.frisen@ki.se; peter.arner@ki.se,"Bergmann, Olaf/A-5706-2009; Arner, Erik/A-1895-2010; Bernard, Samuel/A-5623-2009; Buchholz, Bruce/G-1356-2011; Hassan, Moustapha/H-9260-2015; spalding, kirsty/I-6046-2017","Bergmann, Olaf/0000-0003-1065-4107; Arner, Erik/0000-0003-1225-4908; Bernard, Samuel/0000-0002-8442-9968; Hassan, Moustapha/0000-0003-1927-5859; Westermark, Pal/0000-0002-6637-2566","NCRR NIH HHS [RR13461, P41 RR013461]",,,30,958,985,7,123,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,5-Jun,2008,453,7196,,,,,783,787,,10.1038/nature06902,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,308UK,WOS:000256415300044,18454136,No,Y,N,11/20/17

Containing a wide range of hydrolytic enzymes, lysosomes depend on maintaining acidic luminal pH values for efficient function. Although acidification is mediated by a V- type proton ATPase, a parallel anion pathway is essential to allow bulk proton transport(1,2). The molecular identity of this anion transporter remains unknown. Recent results of knockout experiments raise the possibility that ClC- 7, a member of the CLC family of anion channels and transporters, is a contributor to this pathway in an osteoclast lysosome- like compartment, with loss of ClC- 7 function causing osteopetrosis(3). Several mammalian members of the CLC family have been characterized in detail; some ( including ClC- 0, ClC- 1 and ClC- 2) function as Cl(-) -conducting ion channels(4), whereas others act as Cl(-)/H(+) antiporters ( ClC- 4 and ClC-5) (5,6). However, previous attempts at heterologous expression of ClC- 7 have failed to yield evidence of functional protein, so it is unclear whether ClC- 7 has an important function in lysosomal biology, and also whether this protein functions as a Cl(-) channel, a Cl(-)/H(+) antiporter, or as something else entirely. Here we directly demonstrate an anion transport pathway in lysosomes that has the defining characteristics of a CLC Cl(-)/H(+) antiporter and show that this transporter is the predominant route for Cl(-) through the lysosomal membrane. Furthermore, knockdown of ClC- 7 expression by short interfering RNA can essentially ablate this lysosomal Cl(-)/H(+) antiport activity and can strongly diminish the ability of lysosomes to acidify in vivo, demonstrating that ClC- 7 is a Cl(-)/H(+) antiporter, that it constitutes the major Cl(-) permeability of lysosomes, and that it is important in lysosomal acidification.","[Graves, Austin R.; Curran, Patricia K.; Mindell, Joseph A.] Natl Inst Neurol Disorders & Stroke, Membrane Transport Biophys Unit, Porter Neurosci Res Ctr, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Smith, Carolyn L.] Natl Inst Neurol Disorders & Stroke, Light Microscopy Facil, Porter Neurosci Res Ctr, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA","Mindell, JA (reprint author), Natl Inst Neurol Disorders & Stroke, Membrane Transport Biophys Unit, Porter Neurosci Res Ctr, NIH, 35 Convent Dr,Bldg 35,MSC 3701, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA.",mindellj@ninds.nih.gov,"Mindell, Joseph/P-4461-2017","Mindell, Joseph/0000-0002-6952-8247",Intramural NIH HHS,,,22,171,181,3,15,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,5-Jun,2008,453,7196,,,,,788,792,,10.1038/nature06907,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,308UK,WOS:000256415300045,18449189,No,,,11/20/17

RNA silencing is thought to have evolved as a form of nucleic- acid- based immunity to inactivate viruses and transposable elements. Although the activity of transposable elements in animals has been thought largely to be restricted to the germ line, recent studies have shown that they may also actively transpose in somatic cells, creating somatic mosaicism in animals(3). In the Drosophila germ line, Piwi- interacting RNAs arise from repetitive intergenic elements including retrotransposons by a Dicer-independent pathway and function through the Piwi subfamily of Argonautes to ensure silencing of retrotransposons(4-9). Here we show that, in cultured Drosophila S2 cells, Argonaute 2 ( AGO2), an AGO subfamily member of Argonautes, associates with endogenous small RNAs of 20 - 22 nucleotides in length, which we have collectively named endogenous short interfering RNAs ( esiRNAs). esiRNAs can be divided into two groups: one that mainly corresponds to a subset of retrotransposons, and the other that arises from stem - loop structures. esiRNAs are produced in a Dicer- 2-dependent manner from distinctive genomic loci, are modified at their 39 ends and can direct AGO2 to cleave target RNAs. Mutations in Dicer- 2 caused an increase in retrotransposon transcripts. Together, our findings indicate that different types of small RNAs and Argonautes are used to repress retrotransposons in germline and somatic cells in Drosophila.","[Kawamura, Yoshinori; Saito, Kuniaki; Sunohara, Takafumi; Okada, Tomoko N.; Siomi, Mikiko C.; Siomi, Haruhiko] Univ Tokushima, Inst Genome Res, Tokushima 7708503, Japan; [Saito, Kuniaki; Okada, Tomoko N.; Siomi, Mikiko C.; Siomi, Haruhiko] Keio Univ, Sch Med, Dept Mol Biol, Shinjuku Ku, Tokyo 1608582, Japan; [Kin, Taishin; Asai, Kiyoshi] Natl Inst Adv Ind Sci & Technol, Computat Biol Res Ctr, Tokyo 1350664, Japan; [Ono, Yukiteru] Informat & Math Sci Lab Inc, Tokyo 1120012, Japan; [Asai, Kiyoshi] Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Frontier Sci, Chiba 2778561, Japan; [Siomi, Mikiko C.] Japan Sci & Technol Agcy, CREST, Kawaguchi, Saitama 3320012, Japan","Siomi, MC (reprint author), Univ Tokushima, Inst Genome Res, Tokushima 7708503, Japan.",siomim@sc.itc.keio.ac.jp; awa403@sc.itc.keio.ac.jp,"Saito, Kuniaki/A-6967-2015; Siomi, Haruhiko/A-7020-2015","Saito, Kuniaki/0000-0001-8233-9283; Siomi, Haruhiko/0000-0001-8690-3822",,,,29,267,282,1,18,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,5-Jun,2008,453,7196,,,,,793,U5,,10.1038/nature06938,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,308UK,WOS:000256415300046,18463636,No,,,11/20/17

MicroRNAs are a class of ubiquitously expressed RNAs of 22 nucleotides in length, which arise from structured precursors through the action of Drosha - Pasha and Dicer- 1-Loquacious complexes(1-7). These join Argonaute-1 to regulate gene expression(8,9). A second endogenous small RNA class, the Piwi-interacting RNAs, bind Piwi proteins and suppress transposons(10,11). Piwi- interacting RNAs are restricted to the gonad, and at least a subset of these arises by Piwi- catalysed cleavage of single-stranded RNAs(12,13). Here we show that Drosophila generates a third small RNA class, endogenous small interfering RNAs, in both gonadal and somatic tissues. Production of these RNAs requires Dicer- 2, but a subset depends preferentially on Loquacious(1,4,5) rather than the canonical Dicer- 2 partner, R2D2 ( ref. 14). Endogenous small interfering RNAs arise both from convergent transcription units and from structured genomic loci in a tissue- specific fashion. They predominantly join Argonaute- 2 and have the capacity, as a class, to target both protein- coding genes and mobile elements. These observations expand the repertoire of small RNAs in Drosophila, adding a class that blurs distinctions based on known biogenesis mechanisms and functional roles.","[Czech, Benjamin; Malone, Colin D.; Schlingeheyde, Catherine; Dus, Monica; Sachidanandam, Ravi; Hannon, Gregory J.; Brennecke, Julius] Cold Spring Harbor Lab, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Watson Sch Biol Sci, Cold Spring Harbor, NY 11724 USA; [Zhou, Rui; Perrimon, Norbert] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Genet, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Stark, Alexander; Kellis, Manolis] MIT, Broad Inst, Cambridge, MA 02141 USA; [Stark, Alexander; Kellis, Manolis] Harvard Univ, Broad Inst, Cambridge, MA 02141 USA; [Stark, Alexander] MIT, Comp Sci & Artificial Intelligence Lab, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Wohlschlegel, James A.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, David Geffen Sch Med, Dept Biol Chem, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA","Hannon, GJ (reprint author), Cold Spring Harbor Lab, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Watson Sch Biol Sci, 1 Bungtown Rd, Cold Spring Harbor, NY 11724 USA.",hannon@cshl.edu; brenneck@cshl.edu,"Stark, Alexander/D-1473-2012; Brennecke, Julius/C-1626-2015","Stark, Alexander/0000-0003-2611-0841; Brennecke, Julius/0000-0002-5141-0814; Czech, Benjamin/0000-0001-8471-0007; sachidanandam, ravi/0000-0001-9844-4459; Perrimon, Norbert/0000-0001-7542-472X","NHGRI NIH HHS [U54 HG004570-01, U01 HG004264, U01 HG004264-02, U54 HG004555, U54 HG004555-01, U54 HG004570]",,,32,404,420,0,17,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,5-Jun,2008,453,7196,,,,,798,U7,,10.1038/nature07007,,7,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,308UK,WOS:000256415300047,18463631,No,,,11/20/17

Thus, the amount of HIF-1 alpha, which controls genes involved in energy metabolism and angiogenesis, is regulated post- translationally. Another ancient stress response is the innate immune response, regulated by several transcription factors, among which NF-kappa B plays a central role(5,6). NF-kappa B activation is controlled by I kappa B kinases ( IKK), mainly IKK-beta, needed for phosphorylation- induced degradation of I kappa B inhibitors in response to infection and inflammation(7). IKK-beta is modestly activated in hypoxic cell cultures when PHDs that attenuate its activation are inhibited(8). However, defining the relationship between NF-kappa B and HIF-1 alpha has proven elusive. Using in vitro systems, it was reported that HIF-1 alpha activates NF- kappa B(9), that NF-kappa B controls HIF-1 alpha transcription(10) and that HIF-1 alpha activation may be concurrent with inhibition of NF-kappa B(11). Here we show, with the use of mice lacking IKK-beta in different cell types, that NF-kappa B is a critical transcriptional activator of HIF-1 alpha and that basal NF-kappa B activity is required for HIF-1 alpha protein accumulation under hypoxia in cultured cells and in the liver and brain of hypoxic animals. IKK-beta deficiency results in defective induction of HIF-1 alpha target genes including vascular endothelial growth factor. IKK-beta is also essential for HIF-1 alpha accumulation in macrophages experiencing a bacterial infection. Hence, IKK-beta is an important physiological contributor to the hypoxic response, linking it to innate immunity and inflammation.","[Rius, Jordi; Guma, Monica; Karin, Michael] Univ Calif San Diego, Lab Gene Regulat & Signal Transduct, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Rius, Jordi; Guma, Monica; Schachtrup, Christian; Akassoglou, Katerina; Karin, Michael] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Pharmacol, Sch Med, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Rius, Jordi; Guma, Monica; Karin, Michael] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Pathol, Sch Med, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Zinkernagel, Annelies S.; Nizet, Victor; Haddad, Gabriel G.] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Pediat, Sch Med, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Nizet, Victor] Univ Calif San Diego, Skaggs Sch Pharm & Pharmaceut Sci, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Johnson, Randall S.] Univ Calif San Diego, Mol Biol Sect, Div Biol Sci, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA","Karin, M (reprint author), Univ Calif San Diego, Lab Gene Regulat & Signal Transduct, 9500 Gilman Dr, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.",karinoffice@ucsd.edu,"Zinkernagel, Annelies/F-1780-2017","Zinkernagel, Annelies/0000-0003-4700-1118; RIUS, JORDI/0000-0002-8376-8634; Johnson, Randall/0000-0002-4084-6639; Nizet, Victor/0000-0003-3847-0422","NCI NIH HHS [R01 CA118165]; NCRR NIH HHS [P41 RR004050, P41 RR004050-208577]; NIAID NIH HHS [R01 AI043477, R01 AI043477-12]",,,30,694,729,4,65,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,5-Jun,2008,453,7196,,,,,807,U9,,10.1038/nature06905,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,308UK,WOS:000256415300049,18432192,No,Y,N,11/20/17

Growing evidence for dynamic regulation of these modifications, position- and modification- specific protein interactions, and biochemical crosstalk between modifications has strengthened the 'histone code' hypothesis, in which histone modifications are integral to choreographing the expression of the genome(1,2). One such modification, ubiquitylation of histone H2B ( uH2B) on lysine 120 ( K120) in humans(3), and lysine 123 in yeast(4), has been correlated with enhanced methylation of lysine 79 ( K79) of histone H3 ( refs 5 - 8), by K79- specific methyltransferase Dot1 ( KMT4)(9-11). However, the specific function of uH2B in this crosstalk pathway is not understood. Here we demonstrate, using chemically ubiquitylated H2B, a direct stimulation of hDot1L- mediated intranucleosomal methylation of H3 K79. Two traceless orthogonal expressed protein ligation ( EPL) reactions were used to ubiquitylate H2B site- specifically. This strategy, using a photolytic ligation auxiliary and a desulphurization reaction, should be generally applicable to the chemical ubiquitylation of other proteins. Reconstitution of our uH2B into chemically defined nucleosomes, followed by biochemical analysis, revealed that uH2B directly activates methylation of H3 K79 by hDot1L. This effect is mediated through the catalytic domain of hDot1L, most likely through allosteric mechanisms. Furthermore, asymmetric incorporation of uH2B into dinucleosomes showed that the enhancement of methylation was limited to nucleosomes bearing uH2B. This work demonstrates a direct biochemical crosstalk between two modifications on separate histone proteins within a nucleosome.","[McGinty, Robert K.; Chatterjee, Champak; Muir, Tom W.] Rockefeller Univ, Lab Synth Prot Chem, New York, NY 10065 USA; [Kim, Jaehoon; Roeder, Robert G.] Rockefeller Univ, Biochem & Mol Biol Lab, New York, NY 10065 USA","Muir, TW (reprint author), Rockefeller Univ, Lab Synth Prot Chem, New York, NY 10065 USA.",muirt@rockefeller.edu,"Kim, Jaehoon/G-2711-2011; Chatterjee, Champak/R-7214-2017","Kim, Jaehoon/0000-0003-4035-0438; ","NIGMS NIH HHS [GM07739, R01 GM086868, T32 GM007739]",,,37,281,282,2,35,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,5-Jun,2008,453,7196,,,,,812,U12,,10.1038/nature06906,,8,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,308UK,WOS:000256415300050,18449190,No,,,11/20/17

These parasites must undergo sexual reproduction to transmit from vertebrate hosts to vectors, and their sex ratios are consistently female- biased. Sex allocation theory, a cornerstone of evolutionary biology, is remarkably successful at explaining female- biased sex ratios in multicellular taxa, but has proved controversial when applied to malaria parasites. Here we show that, as predicted by theory, sex ratio is an important fitness- determining trait and Plasmodium chabaudi parasites adjust their sex allocation in response to the presence of unrelated conspecifics. This suggests that P. chabaudi parasites use kin discrimination to evaluate the genetic diversity of their infections, and they adjust their behaviour in response to environmental cues. Malaria parasites provide a novel way to test evolutionary theory, and support the generality and power of a darwinian approach.","[Reece, Sarah E.; Gardner, Andy] Univ Edinburgh, Inst Evolut Biol, Ashworth Labs, Sch Biol Sci, Edinburgh EH9 3JT, Midlothian, Scotland; [Reece, Sarah E.; Drew, Damien R.] Univ Edinburgh, Inst Immunol & Infect Res, Ashworth Labs, Sch Biol Sci, Edinburgh EH9 3JT, Midlothian, Scotland; [Drew, Damien R.] Walter & Eliza Hall Inst Med Res, Ctr Biotechnol, Bundoora, Vic 3086, Australia","Reece, SE (reprint author), Univ Edinburgh, Inst Evolut Biol, Ashworth Labs, Sch Biol Sci, W Mains Rd, Edinburgh EH9 3JT, Midlothian, Scotland.",sarah.reece@ed.ac.uk,"Reece, Sarah/C-9447-2009; Gardner, Andy/K-5353-2013","Reece, Sarah/0000-0001-6716-6732; Gardner, Andy/0000-0002-1304-3734",Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council; Wellcome Trust,,,50,117,121,1,32,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,29-May,2008,453,7195,,,,,609,U1,,10.1038/nature06954,,7,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,305NN,WOS:000256185200034,18509435,No,,,11/20/17

However, little is known about the genome- scale evolutionary dynamics of this pathogen. Similarly, how genomic processes relate to global influenza epidemiology, in which the A/ H3N2 and A/ H1N1 subtypes co- circulate, is poorly understood. Here through an analysis of 1,302 complete viral genomes sampled from temperate populations in both hemispheres, we show that the genomic evolution of influenza A virus is characterized by a complex interplay between frequent reassortment and periodic selective sweeps. The A/ H3N2 and A/ H1N1 subtypes exhibit different evolutionary dynamics, with diverse lineages circulating in A/ H1N1, indicative of weaker antigenic drift. These results suggest a sink - source model of viral ecology in which new lineages are seeded from a persistent influenza reservoir, which we hypothesize to be located in the tropics, to sink populations in temperate regions.","[Rambaut, Andrew] Univ Edinburgh, Inst Evolutionary Biol, Ashworth Labs, Edinburgh EH9 3JT, Midlothian, Scotland; [Pybus, Oliver G.] Univ Oxford, Dept Zool, Oxford OX1 3PS, England; [Nelson, Martha I.; Holmes, Edward C.] Penn State Univ, Ctr Infect Dis Dynam, Dept Biol, Mueller Lab, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Viboud, Cecile; Holmes, Edward C.] NIH, Fogarty Int Ctr, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Taubenberger, Jeffery K.] NIAID, Infect Dis Lab, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA","Rambaut, A (reprint author), Univ Edinburgh, Inst Evolutionary Biol, Ashworth Labs, Edinburgh EH9 3JT, Midlothian, Scotland.",a.rambaut@ed.ac.uk; ech15@psu.edu,"pybus, oliver/B-2640-2012","Rambaut, Andrew/0000-0003-4337-3707; Pybus, Oliver/0000-0002-8797-2667; Holmes, Edward/0000-0001-9596-3552",Intramural NIH HHS [Z01 AI000996-01],,,49,467,487,8,80,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,29-May,2008,453,7195,,,,,615,U2,,10.1038/nature06945,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,305NN,WOS:000256185200035,18418375,No,Y,N,11/20/17

Imbalances in the composition of the bacterial microbiota, known as dysbiosis, are postulated to be a major factor in human disorders such as inflammatory bowel disease. We report here that the prominent human symbiont Bacteroides fragilis protects animals from experimental colitis induced by Helicobacter hepaticus, a commensal bacterium with pathogenic potential. This beneficial activity requires a single microbial molecule ( polysaccharide A, PSA). In animals harbouring B. fragilis not expressing PSA, H. hepaticus colonization leads to disease and pro- inflammatory cytokine production in colonic tissues. Purified PSA administered to animals is required to suppress pro- inflammatory interleukin- 17 production by intestinal immune cells and also inhibits in vitro reactions in cell cultures. Furthermore, PSA protects from inflammatory disease through a functional requirement for interleukin- 10- producing CD4(+) T cells. These results show that molecules of the bacterial microbiota can mediate the critical balance between health and disease. Harnessing the immunomodulatory capacity of symbiosis factors such as PSA might potentially provide therapeutics for human inflammatory disorders on the basis of entirely novel biological principles.","[Mazmanian, Sarkis K.; Round, June L.] CALTECH, Div Biol, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA; [Kasper, Dennis L.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Channing Lab, Brigham & Womens Hosp, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Kasper, Dennis L.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Microbiol & Mol Genet, Boston, MA 02115 USA","Mazmanian, SK (reprint author), CALTECH, Div Biol, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA.",sarkis@caltech.edu; dennis_kasper@hms.harvard.edu,,"Mazmanian, Sarkis/0000-0003-2713-1513",NIAID NIH HHS [R01 AI039576],,,38,914,948,22,289,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,29-May,2008,453,7195,,,,,620,625,,10.1038/nature07008,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,305NN,WOS:000256185200036,18509436,No,Y,N,11/20/17

The potential evolutionary links and differences between these two types of object are still unknown; recent studies, however, have provided circumstantial evidence connecting magnetars with very massive progenitor stars(3-5). Here we report the discovery of an infrared elliptical ring or shell surrounding the magnetar SGR 1900+14. The appearance and energetics of the ring are difficult to interpret within the framework of the progenitor's stellar mass loss or the subsequent evolution of the supernova remnant. We suggest instead that a dust- free cavity was produced in the magnetar environment by the giant flare emitted by the source in August 1998. Considering the total energy released in the flare, the theoretical dust- destruction radius matches well with the observed dimensions of the ring. We conclude that SGR 1900+14 is unambiguously associated with a cluster of massive stars, thereby solidifying the link between magnetars and massive stars.","[Wachter, S.] CALTECH, Spitzer Sci Ctr, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA; [Dwarkadas, V.

Apart from its mathematical interest, the problem has practical relevance(3) in a wide range of fields, from granular processing to fruit packing. There are currently numerous experiments showing that the loosest way to pack spheres ( random loose packing) gives a density of similar to 55 per cent(4-6). On the other hand, the most compact way to pack spheres ( random close packing) results in a maximum density of similar to 64 per cent(2,4,6). Although these values seem to be robust, there is as yet no physical interpretation for them. Here we present a statistical description of jammed states(7) in which random close packing can be interpreted as the ground state of the ensemble of jammed matter. Our approach demonstrates that random packings of hard spheres in three dimensions cannot exceed a density limit of similar to 63.4 per cent.

This phenomenon, often related to a zero- temperature magnetic phase transition, is believed to govern many of the fascinating properties of strongly correlated systems such as heavy- fermion compounds or high- temperature superconductors(1). In contrast to bulk materials with very complex electronic structures, artificial nanoscale devices could offer a new and simpler means of understanding quantum phase transitions(2,3). Here we demonstrate this possibility in a single- molecule quantum dot, where a gate voltage induces a crossing of two different types of electron spin state ( singlet and triplet) at zero magnetic field. The quantum dot is operated in the Kondo regime, where the electron spin on the quantum dot is partially screened by metallic electrodes. This strong electronic coupling between the quantum dot and the metallic contacts provides the strong electron correlations necessary to observe quantum critical behaviour. The quantum magnetic phase transition between two different Kondo regimes is achieved by tuning gate voltages and is fundamentally different from previously observed Kondo transitions in semiconductor and nanotube quantum dots(4,5).

A typical example is titanium dioxide ( TiO2), which has promising energy and environmental applications(14-17). Most available anatase TiO2 crystals are dominated by the thermodynamically stable {101} facets ( more than 94 per cent, according to the Wulff construction(10)), rather than the much more reactive {001} facets(8-13,18-20).

We explored this effect systematically for a range of non- metallic adsorbate atoms by first- principle quantum chemical calculations. On the basis of theoretical predictions, we have synthesized uniform anatase TiO2 single crystals with a high percentage ( 47 per cent) of {001} facets using hydrofluoric acid as a morphology controlling agent.

Marinoan glacial- marine deposits occur at equatorial palaeolatitudes(2), and are sharply overlain by a thin interval of carbonate that preserves marine carbon and sulphur isotopic excursions of about 25 and 115 parts per thousand, respectively(3-5); these deposits are thought to record widespread oceanic carbonate precipitation during postglacial sea level rise(1,3,4). This abrupt transition records a climate system in profound disequilibrium(3,6) and contrasts sharply with the cyclical stratigraphic signal imparted by the balanced feedbacks modulating Phanerozoic deglaciation. Hypotheses accounting for the abruptness of deglaciation include ice albedo feedback(3), deep- ocean out- gassing during post- glacial oceanic overturn(7) or methane hydrate destabilization(8-10). Here we report the broadest range of oxygen isotope values yet measured in marine sediments ( -25 parts per thousand to +12 parts per thousand) in methane seeps in Marinoan deglacial sediments underlying the cap carbonate. This range of values is likely to be the result of mixing between ice- sheet- derived meteoric waters and clathrate- derived fluids during the flushing and destabilization of a clathrate field by glacial meltwater. The equatorial palaeolatitude implies a highly volatile shelf permafrost pool that is an order of magnitude larger than that of the present day. A pool of this size could have provided a massive biogeochemical feedback capable of triggering deglaciation and accounting for the global postglacial marine carbon and sulphur isotopic excursions, abrupt unidirectional warming, cap carbonate deposition, and a marine oxygen crisis. Our findings suggest that methane released from low- latitude permafrost clathrates therefore acted as a trigger and/ or strong positive feedback for deglaciation and warming. Methane hydrate destabilization is increasingly suspected as an important positive feedback to climate change(11-13) that coincides with critical boundaries in the geological record(14,15) and may represent one particularly important mechanism active during conditions of strong climate forcing.","[Kennedy, Martin; Mrofka, David] Univ Calif Riverside, Dept Earth Sci, Riverside, CA 92521 USA; [von der Borch, Chris] Flinders Univ S Australia, Sch Chem Phys & Earth Sci, Adelaide, SA 5001, Australia","Kennedy, M (reprint author), Univ Calif Riverside, Dept Earth Sci, Riverside, CA 92521 USA.",martink@mail.ucr.edu,,,,,,30,73,81,2,77,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,29-May,2008,453,7195,,,,,642,645,,10.1038/nature06961,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,305NN,WOS:000256185200041,18509441,No,,,11/20/17

The weak cooling apparent in the middle part of the century has been interpreted in the context of a variety of physical factors, such as atmosphere - ocean interactions and anthropogenic emissions of sulphate aerosols(2). Here we call attention to a previously overlooked discontinuity in the record at 1945, which is a prominent feature of the cooling trend in the midtwentieth century. The discontinuity is evident in published versions of the global- mean temperature time series(1), but stands out more clearly after the data are filtered for the effects of internal climate variability. We argue that the abrupt temperature drop of similar to 0.3 degrees C in 1945 is the apparent result of uncorrected instrumental biases in the sea surface temperature record. Corrections for the discontinuity are expected to alter the character of mid- twentieth century temperature variability but not estimates of the century-long trend in global- mean temperatures.","[Thompson, David W.

Phylogenetic analyses of basaltic lavas from the East Pacific Rise ( 9 degrees N) and around Hawaii reveal that the basalt- hosted biosphere harbours high bacterial community richness and that community membership is shared between these sites.

These dynamic organelles(5) serve as the principal reservoirs for storing cellular energy and for the building blocks for membrane lipids. Excessive lipid accumulation in cells is a central feature of obesity, diabetes and atherosclerosis, yet remarkably little is known about lipid- droplet cell biology. Here we show, by means of a genome- wide RNA interference ( RNAi) screen in Drosophila S2 cells that about 1.5% of all genes function in lipid- droplet formation and regulation. The phenotypes of the gene knockdowns sorted into five distinct phenotypic classes. Genes encoding enzymes of phospholipid biosynthesis proved to be determinants of lipid- droplet size and number, suggesting that the phospholipid composition of the monolayer profoundly affects droplet morphology and lipid utilization. A subset of the Arf1 - COPI vesicular transport proteins also regulated droplet morphology and lipid utilization, thereby identifying a previously unrecognized function for this machinery. These phenotypes are conserved in mammalian cells, suggesting that insights from these studies are likely to be central to our understanding of human diseases involving excessive lipid storage.","[Guo, Yi; Walther, Tobias C.; Walter, Peter; Farese, Robert V., Jr.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Biochem & Biophys, San Francisco, CA 94158 USA; [Stuurman, Nico; Goshima, Gohta; Vale, Ronald D.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Cellular & Mol Pharmacol, San Francisco, CA 94158 USA; [Farese, Robert V., Jr.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Med, San Francisco, CA 94158 USA; [Guo, Yi; Rao, Meghana; Terayama, Koji; Wong, Jinny S.; Farese, Robert V., Jr.] Gladstone Inst Cardiovasc Dis, San Francisco, CA 94158 USA; [Walther, Tobias C.] Max Planck Inst Biochem, D-12852 Martinsried, Germany; [Vale, Ronald D.; Walter, Peter] Univ Calif San Francisco, Howard Hughes Med Inst, San Francisco, CA 94158 USA","Farese, RV (reprint author), Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Biochem & Biophys, San Francisco, CA 94158 USA.",twalther@biochem.mpg.de; bfarese@gladstone.ucsf.edu,"Lai, Michael Ming-Chao/I-7001-2012",,"Howard Hughes Medical Institute; NIDDK NIH HHS [R21 DK078254, R21 DK078254-01]",,,30,369,376,8,67,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,29-May,2008,453,7195,,,,,657,661,,10.1038/nature06928,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,305NN,WOS:000256185200045,18408709,No,Y,N,11/20/17

Class IA PI3K isoforms(1) couple to tyrosine kinases and consist of a p110 catalytic subunit ( p110 alpha, p110 beta or p110 delta), constitutively bound to one of five distinct p85 regulatory subunits. PI3Ks have been implicated in angiogenesis(2-5), but little is known about potential selectivity among the PI3K isoforms and their mechanism of action in endothelial cells during angiogenesis in vivo. Here we show that only p110 alpha activity is essential for vascular development. Ubiquitous or endothelial cell- specific inactivation of p110 alpha led to embryonic lethality at mid- gestation because of severe defects in angiogenic sprouting and vascular remodelling. p110 alpha exerts this critical endothelial cell- autonomous function by regulating endothelial cell migration through the small GTPase RhoA. p110 alpha activity is particularly high in endothelial cells and preferentially induced by tyrosine kinase ligands ( such as vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF)- A). In contrast, p110 delta in endothelial cells signals downstream of G- protein- coupled receptor ( GPCR) ligands such as SDF-1 alpha, whereas p110 delta is expressed at low level and contributes only minimally to PI3K activity in endothelial cells.

For influenza virus, annual vaccinations are given to maintain protective levels of antibody against the currently circulating strains. Here we report that after booster vaccination there was a rapid and robust influenza-specific IgG(+) antibody- secreting plasma cell ( ASC) response that peaked at approximately day 7 and accounted for up to 6% of peripheral blood B cells. These ASCs could be distinguished from influenza- specific IgG(+) memory B cells that peaked 14 - 21 days after vaccination and averaged 1% of all B cells. Importantly, as much as 80% of ASCs purified at the peak of the response were influenza specific. This ASC response was characterized by a highly restricted B- cell receptor ( BCR) repertoire that in some donors was dominated by only a few B- cell clones. This pauciclonal response, however, showed extensive intraclonal diversification from accumulated somatic mutations. We used the immunoglobulin variable regions isolated from sorted single ASCs to produce over 50 human monoclonal antibodies ( mAbs) that bound to the three influenza vaccine strains with high affinity. This strategy demonstrates that we can generate multiple high-affinity mAbs from humans within a month after vaccination. The panel of influenza- virus- specific human mAbs allowed us to address the issue of original antigenic sin ( OAS): the phenomenon where the induced antibody shows higher affinity to a previously encountered influenza virus strain compared with the virus strain present in the vaccine(1). However, we found that most of the influenza- virus- specific mAbs showed the highest affinity for the current vaccine strain. Thus, OAS does not seem to be a common occurrence in normal, healthy adults receiving influenza vaccination.","[Smith, Kenneth; Zheng, Nai-Ying; Mays, Israel; Garman, Lori; Helms, Christina; Wilson, Patrick C.] Oklahoma Med Res Fdn, Immunobiol & Canc Res Program, Oklahoma City, OK 73104 USA; [Wrammert, Jens; Miller, Joe; Langley, William A.; Ahmed, Rafi] Emory Univ, Sch Med, Emory Vaccine Ctr, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA; [Wrammert, Jens; Miller, Joe; Langley, William A.; Ahmed, Rafi] Emory Univ, Sch Med, Dept Microbiol & Immunol, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA; [Kokko, Kenneth; Larsen, Christian] Emory Univ, Sch Med, Emory Transplant Ctr, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA; [Kokko, Kenneth; Larsen, Christian] Emory Univ, Sch Med, Dept Surg, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA; [James, Judith] Oklahoma Med Res Fdn, Arthritis & Immunol Res Program, Oklahoma City, OK 73104 USA; [Capra, J.

CLEC5A ( C- type lectin domain family 5, member A; also known as myeloid DAP12- associating lectin ( MDL-1))(3) contains a C- type lectin- like fold similar to the natural- killer T- cell C- type lectin domains and associates with a 12- kDa DNAX- activating protein ( DAP12)(4) on myeloid cells. Here we show that CLEC5A interacts with the dengue virion directly and thereby brings about DAP12 phosphorylation. The CLEC5A DV interaction does not result in viral entry but stimulates the release of proinflammatory cytokines. Blockade of CLEC5A - DV interaction suppresses the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines without affecting the release of interferon-alpha, supporting the notion that CLEC5A acts as a signalling receptor for proinflammatory cytokine release. Moreover, anti- CLEC5A monoclonal antibodies inhibit DV- induced plasma leakage, as well as subcutaneous and vital- organ haemorrhaging, and reduce the mortality of DV infection by about 50% in STAT1- deficient mice. Our observation that blockade of CLEC5A- mediated signalling attenuates the production of proinflammatory cytokines by macrophages infected with DV ( either alone or complexed with an enhancing antibody) offers a promising strategy for alleviating tissue damage and increasing the survival of patients suffering from dengue haemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome, and possibly even other virus- induced inflammatory diseases.","[Chen, Szu-Ting; Huang, Ming-Ting; Wu, Ming-Fang; Cheng, Shih-Chin; Hsieh, Shie-Liang] Natl Yang Ming Univ, Dept Microbiol & Immunol, Taipei 112, Taiwan; [Chen, Szu-Ting; Huang, Ming-Ting; Wu, Ming-Fang; Cheng, Shih-Chin; Hsieh, Shie-Liang] Natl Yang Ming Univ, Inst Microbiol & Immunol, Taipei 112, Taiwan; [Lin, Yi-Ling] Acad Sinica, Inst Biomed Sci, Taipei 115, Taiwan; [Lin, Yi-Ling; Wong, Chi-Huey; Hsieh, Shie-Liang] Acad Sinica, Genom Res Ctr, Taipei 115, Taiwan; [Lei, Huan-Yao] Natl Cheng Kung Univ, Dept Microbiol & Immunol, Tainan 70101, Taiwan; [Lee, Chien-Kuo] Natl Taiwan Univ, Inst Immunol, Taipei 100, Taiwan; [Chiou, Tzyy-Wen] Natl Dong Hwa Univ, Dept Life Sci, Hualien 974, Taiwan; [Chiou, Tzyy-Wen] Natl Dong Hwa Univ, Inst Biotechnol, Hualien 974, Taiwan; [Hsieh, Shie-Liang] Natl Yang Ming Univ, Immunol Res Ctr, Taipei 112, Taiwan; [Hsieh, Shie-Liang] Taipei Vet Gen Hosp, Taipei 112, Taiwan","Hsieh, SL (reprint author), Natl Yang Ming Univ, Dept Microbiol & Immunol, Taipei 112, Taiwan.",slhsieh@ym.edu.tw,,"Lee, Chien-Kuo/0000-0001-8189-6045; CHENG, SHIH-CHIN/0000-0003-1251-8774",NIGMS NIH HHS [GM62116],,,30,181,185,0,27,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,29-May,2008,453,7195,,,,,672,U12,,10.1038/nature07013,,7,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,305NN,WOS:000256185200048,18496526,No,,,11/20/17

SSBs have multiple roles in binding and sequestering ssDNA, detecting DNA damage, stimulating nucleases, helicases and strand- exchange proteins, activating transcription and mediating protein - protein interactions. In eukaryotes, the major SSB, replication protein A ( RPA), is a heterotrimer(1). Here we describe a second human SSB ( hSSB1), with a domain organization closer to the archaeal SSB than to RPA. Ataxia telangiectasia mutated ( ATM) kinase phosphorylates hSSB1 in response to DNA double- strand breaks ( DSBs). This phosphorylation event is required for DNA damage- induced stabilization of hSSB1. Upon induction of DNA damage, hSSB1 accumulates in the nucleus and forms distinct foci independent of cell- cycle phase. These foci co-localize with other known repair proteins. In contrast to RPA, hSSB1 does not localize to replication foci in S- phase cells and hSSB1 deficiency does not influence S- phase progression. Depletion of hSSB1 abrogates the cellular response to DSBs, including activation of ATM and phosphorylation of ATM targets after ionizing radiation. Cells deficient in hSSB1 exhibit increased radiosensitivity, defective checkpoint activation and enhanced genomic instability coupled with a diminished capacity for DNA repair. These findings establish that hSSB1 influences diverse end-points in the cellular DNA damage response.","[Richard, Derek J.; Bolderson, Emma; Savage, Kienan; Tsvetanov, Sergie; Khanna, Kum Kum] Queensland Inst Med Res, Signal Transduct Lab, Brisbane, Qld 4029, Australia; [Cubeddu, Liza; Wadsworth, Ross I.

Phosphorylated (gamma)-H2AX - which recruits molecules that sense or signal the presence of DNA breaks, activating the response that leads to repair(2,3) - is the earliest known marker of chromosomal DNA breakage. Here we identify a dynamic change in chromatin that promotes H2AX phosphorylation in mammalian cells. DNA breaks swiftly mobilize heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1)-beta ( also called CBX1), a chromatin factor bound to histone H3 methylated on lysine 9 ( H3K9me). Local changes in histone- tail modifications are not apparent. Instead, phosphorylation of HP1-beta on amino acid Thr 51 accompanies mobilization, releasing HP1-beta from chromatin by disrupting hydrogen bonds that fold its chromodomain around H3K9me. Inhibition of casein kinase 2 ( CK2), an enzyme implicated in DNA damage sensing and repair(4-6), suppresses Thr 51 phosphorylation and HP1-beta mobilization in living cells. CK2 inhibition, or a constitutively chromatin- bound HP1-beta mutant, diminishes H2AX phosphorylation. Our findings reveal an unrecognized signalling cascade that helps to initiate the DNA damage response, altering chromatin by modifying a histone- code mediator protein, HP1, but not the code itself.","[Ayoub, Nabieh; Jeyasekharan, Anand D.; Bernal, Juan A.; Venkitaraman, Ashok R.] Hutchison MRC Res Ctr, Med Res Council Canc Cell Unit, Cambridge CB2 0XZ, England","Venkitaraman, AR (reprint author), Hutchison MRC Res Ctr, Med Res Council Canc Cell Unit, Hills Rd, Cambridge CB2 0XZ, England.",arv22@cam.ac.uk,"Bernal, Juan /N-4544-2014","Bernal, Juan /0000-0002-9933-5550","Medical Research Council [G9900064, , G0600332, G0700651, MC_U105359877]",,,26,253,262,3,25,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,29-May,2008,453,7195,,,,,682,U14,,10.1038/nature06875,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,305NN,WOS:000256185200050,18438399,No,,,11/20/17

Historically, supernovae were discovered mainly through their 'delayed' optical light (some days after the burst of neutrinos that marks the actual event), preventing observations in the first moments following the explosion. As a result, the progenitors of some supernovae and the events leading up to their violent demise remain intensely debated. Here we report the serendipitous discovery of a supernova at the time of the explosion, marked by an extremely luminous X-ray outburst. We attribute the outburst to the 'break-out' of the supernova shock wave from the progenitor star, and show that the inferred rate of such events agrees with that of all core-collapse supernovae. We predict that future wide-field X-ray surveys will catch each year hundreds of supernovae in the act of exploding.","[Soderberg, A.

Understanding the mechanism of shape determination in cells has proved to be extremely challenging due to the numerous components involved and the complexity of their interactions. Here we harness the natural phenotypic variability in a large population of motile epithelial keratocytes from fish (Hypsophrys nicaraguensis) to reveal mechanisms of shape determination. We find that the cells inhabit a low-dimensional, highly correlated spectrum of possible functional states. We further show that a model of actin network treadmilling in an inextensible membrane bag can quantitatively recapitulate this spectrum and predict both cell shape and speed. Our model provides a simple biochemical and biophysical basis for the observed morphology and behaviour of motile cells.","[Keren, Kinneret; Pincus, Zachary; Allen, Greg M.; Barnhart, Erin L.; Theriot, Julie A.] Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Dept Biochem, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Theriot, Julie A.] Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Dept Microbiol & Immunol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Keren, Kinneret] Technion Israel Inst Technol, Dept Phys, IL-32000 Haifa, Israel; [Pincus, Zachary] Yale Univ, Dept Mol Cellular & Dev Biol, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Marriott, Gerard] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Physiol, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Mogilner, Alex] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Neurobiol Physiol & Behav, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Mogilner, Alex] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Math, Davis, CA 95616 USA","Theriot, JA (reprint author), Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Dept Biochem, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",theriot@stanford.edu,"Mogilner, Alex/A-3135-2008","Pincus, Zachary/0000-0001-9785-5977","NIGMS NIH HHS [U54 GM064346, U54 GM064346-099040, U54 GM64346]",,,36,324,328,1,56,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,22-May,2008,453,7194,,,,,475,U1,,10.1038/nature06952,,7,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,303EL,WOS:000256023700033,18497816,No,,,11/20/17

Like proteasomal ubiquitin receptor Rpn10/S5a, Rpn13 also binds ubiquitin-like (UBL) domains of UBL- ubiquitin- associated (UBA) proteins. In yeast, a synthetic phenotype results when specific mutations of the ubiquitin binding sites of Rpn10 and Rpn13 are combined, indicating functional linkage between these ubiquitin receptors.

RecA, ATP and single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) form a helical filament that binds to double-stranded DNA (dsDNA), searches for homology, and then catalyses the exchange of the complementary strand, producing a new heteroduplex. Here we have solved the crystal structures of the Escherichia coli RecA-ssDNA and RecA-heteroduplex filaments. They show that ssDNA and ATP bind to RecA-RecA interfaces cooperatively, explaining the ATP dependency of DNA binding. The ATP c-phosphate is sensed across the RecA-RecA interface by two lysine residues that also stimulate ATP hydrolysis, providing a mechanism for DNA release. The DNA is underwound and stretched globally, but locally it adopts a B-DNA-like conformation that restricts the homology search to Watson - Crick- type base pairing. The complementary strand interacts primarily through base pairing, making heteroduplex formation strictly dependent on complementarity. The underwound, stretched filament conformation probably evolved to destabilize the donor duplex, freeing the complementary strand for homology sampling.","[Chen, Zhucheng; Yang, Haijuan; Pavletich, Nikola P.] Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Struct Biol Program, New York, NY 10021 USA; [Pavletich, Nikola P.] Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Howard Hughes Med Inst, New York, NY 10021 USA; [Chen, Zhucheng] Cornell Univ, Weill Med Coll, Dept Biochem & Struct Biol, New York, NY 10021 USA","Pavletich, NP (reprint author), Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Struct Biol Program, 1275 York Ave, New York, NY 10021 USA.",pavletin@mskcc.org,"Chen, Zhucheng/E-3327-2010; Zhang, Qiuyu/E-3326-2010",,Howard Hughes Medical Institute,,,50,329,332,8,64,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,22-May,2008,453,7194,,,,,489,U3,,10.1038/nature06971,,8,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,303EL,WOS:000256023700035,18497818,No,Y,N,11/20/17

The first application of a random walk was in the description of particle motion in a fluid (brownian motion); now it is a central concept in statistical physics, describing transport phenomena such as heat, sound and light diffusion(1). Levy flights are a particular class of generalized random walk in which the step lengths during the walk are described by a 'heavy-tailed' probability distribution. They can describe all stochastic processes that are scale invariant(2,3). Levy flights have accordingly turned out to be applicable to a diverse range of fields, describing animal foraging patterns(4), the distribution of human travel(5) and even some aspects of earthquake behaviour(6). Transport based on Levy flights has been extensively studied numerically(7-9), but experimental work has been limited(10,11) and, to date, it has not seemed possible to observe and study Levy transport in actual materials. For example, experimental work on heat, sound, and light diffusion is generally limited to normal, brownian, diffusion. Here we show that it is possible to engineer an optical material in which light waves perform a Levy flight. The key parameters that determine the transport behaviour can be easily tuned, making this an ideal experimental system in which to study Levy flights in a controlled way. The development of a material in which the diffusive transport of light is governed by Levy statistics might even permit the development of new optical functionalities that go beyond normal light diffusion.","[Barthelemy, Pierre; Bertolotti, Jacopo; Wiersma, Diederik S.] European Lab Nonlinear Spect, I-50019 Florence, Italy; [Barthelemy, Pierre; Bertolotti, Jacopo; Wiersma, Diederik S.] INFM BEC, I-50019 Florence, Italy","Wiersma, DS (reprint author), European Lab Nonlinear Spect, Via Nello Carrara 1, I-50019 Florence, Italy.",wiersma@lens.unifi.it,"Bertolotti, Jacopo/A-4314-2009; Barthelemy, Pierre/A-4316-2009; Barthelemy, Pierre/D-2266-2010","Bertolotti, Jacopo/0000-0002-7163-6343; ",,,,29,307,307,6,68,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,22-May,2008,453,7194,,,,,495,498,,10.1038/nature06948,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,303EL,WOS:000256023700036,18497819,No,Y,N,11/20/17

They can dramatically change the properties of materials, imparting solid-like behaviour to a wide variety of complex fluids(1,2). This behaviour arises when particles aggregate to form mesoscopic clusters and networks. The essential component leading to aggregation is an interparticle attraction, which can be generated by many physical and chemical mechanisms. In the limit of irreversible aggregation, infinitely strong interparticle bonds lead to diffusion-limited cluster aggregation(3) (DLCA). This is understood as a purely kinetic phenomenon that can form solid-like gels at arbitrarily low particle volume fraction(4,5). Far more important technologically are systems with weaker attractions, where gel formation requires higher volume fractions. Numerous scenarios for gelation have been proposed, including DLCA(6), kinetic or dynamic arrest(4,7-10), phase separation(5,6,11-16), percolation(4,12,17,18) and jamming(8). No consensus has emerged and, despite its ubiquity and significance, gelation is far from understood-even the location of the gelation phase boundary is not agreed on(5). Here we report experiments showing that gelation of spherical particles with isotropic, short-range attractions is initiated by spinodal decomposition; this thermodynamic instability triggers the formation of density fluctuations, leading to spanning clusters that dynamically arrest to create a gel. This simple picture of gelation does not depend on microscopic system-specific details, and should thus apply broadly to any particle system with short- range attractions. Our results suggest that gelation-often considered a purely kinetic phenomenon(4,8-10)-is in fact a direct consequence of equilibrium liquid gas phase separation(5,13-15).

Although much of the history of the lithosphere and hydrosphere is contained in rock and mineral records, corresponding information about the atmosphere is scarce and elusive owing to the lack of direct records. Geologists have used sedimentary minerals, fossils and geochemical models to place constraints on the concentrations of carbon dioxide, oxygen or methane in the past(1-4). Here we show that the triple oxygen isotope composition of sulphate from ancient evaporites and barites shows variable negative oxygen-17 isotope anomalies over the past 750 million years. We propose that these anomalies track those of atmospheric oxygen and in turn reflect the partial pressure of carbon dioxide (p(CO2)) in the past through a photochemical reaction network linking stratospheric ozone to carbon dioxide and to oxygen(5,6). Our results suggest that p(CO2) was much higher in the early Cambrian than in younger eras, agreeing with previous modelling results(2). We also find that the (17)O isotope anomalies of barites from Marinoan (similar to 635 million years ago) cap carbonates display a distinct negative spike (around 20.70%), suggesting that by the time barite was precipitating in the immediate aftermath of a Neoproterozoic global glaciation, the p(CO2) was at its highest level in the past 750 million years. Our finding is consistent with the 'snowball Earth' hypothesis(7,8) and/or a massive methane release(9) after the Marinoan glaciation.","[Bao, Huiming] Louisiana State Univ, Dept Geol & Geophys, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA; [Lyons, J.

This should enable the application of material failure forecasting methods to eruption forecasting(2,3). To date, such methods have been based exclusively on the seismicity of the country rock(4). It is clear, however, that the rheology and deformation rate of the lava ultimately dictate eruption style(5). The highly crystalline lavas involved in these eruptions are pseudoplastic fluids that exhibit a strong component of shear thinning as their deformation accelerates across the ductile to brittle transition(6). Thus, understanding the nature of the ductile-brittle transition in dome lavas may well hold the key to an accurate description of dome growth and stability. Here we present the results of rheological experiments with continuous microseismic monitoring, which reveal that dome lavas are seismogenic and that the character of the seismicity changes markedly across the ductile-brittle transition until complete brittle failure occurs at high strain rates. We conclude that magma seismicity, combined with failure forecasting methods, could potentially be applied successfully to dome-building eruptions for volcanic forecasting.","[Lavallee, Y.; Dingwell, D.

This thinking underpins our understanding of volcanic earthquakes, which are assumed to occur in cold rocks surrounding moving magma. However, the recent discovery of abundant brittle-ductile fault textures in silicic lavas(2-4) has led to the counter-intuitive hypothesis that seismic events may be triggered by fracture and faulting within the erupting magma itself. This hypothesis is supported by recent observations of growing lava domes, where microearthquake swarms have coincided with the emplacement of gouge-covered lava spines(5,6), leading to models of seismogenic stick-slip along shallow shear zones in the magma(7). But can fracturing or faulting in high-temperature, eruptible magma really generate measurable seismic events? Here we deform high-temperature silica-rich magmas under simulated volcanic conditions in order to test the hypothesis that hightemperature magma fracture is seismogenic. The acoustic emissions recorded during experiments show that seismogenic rupture may occur in both crystal- rich and crystal-free silicic magmas at eruptive temperatures, extending the range of known conditions for seismogenic faulting.","[Tuffen, Hugh] Univ Lancaster, Dept Environm Sci, Lancaster LA1 4YQ, England; [Tuffen, Hugh; Smith, Rosanna; Sammonds, Peter R.] UCL, Dept Earth Sci, London WC1E 6BT, England","Tuffen, H (reprint author), Univ Lancaster, Dept Environm Sci, Lancaster LA1 4YQ, England.",h.tuffen@lancaster.ac.uk,"Tuffen, Hugh/A-5388-2009; Jiao, Liqing/A-8821-2011",,,,,30,74,75,1,30,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,22-May,2008,453,7194,,,,,511,514,,10.1038/nature06989,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,303EL,WOS:000256023700040,18497823,No,,,11/20/17

Current discussions focus on three competing hypotheses: a monophyletic origin within either Temnospondyli(4-7) or Lepospondyli(8-10), or a polyphyletic origin with frogs and salamanders arising among temnospondyls and caecilians among the lepospondyls(11-16). Recent molecular analyses are also controversial, with estimations for the batrachian (frog salamander) divergence significantly older than the palaeontological evidence supports(17,18). Here we report the discovery of an amphibamid temnospondyl from the Early Permian of Texas that bridges the gap between other Palaeozoic amphibians and the earliest known salientians(19,20) and caudatans(21) from the Mesozoic. The presence of a mosaic of salientian and caudatan characters in this small fossil makes it a key taxon close to the batrachian (frog and salamander) divergence. Phylogenetic analysis suggests that the batrachian divergence occurred in the Middle Permian, rather than the late Carboniferous as recently estimated using molecular clocks(18,22), but the divergence with caecilians corresponds to the deep split between temnospondyls and lepospondyls, which is congruent with themolecular estimates.","[Anderson, Jason S.] Univ Calgary, Dept Comparat Biol & Expt Med, Fac Vet Med, Calgary, AB T2N 4N1, Canada; [Reisz, Robert R.; Scott, Diane] Univ Toronto, Dept Biol, Mississauga, ON L5L 1C6, Canada; [Frobisch, Nadia B.] McGill Univ, Redpath Museum, Montreal, PQ H3A 2K6, Canada; [Sumida, Stuart S.] Calif State Univ San Bernardino, Dept Biol, San Bernardino, CA 92407 USA","Anderson, JS (reprint author), Univ Calgary, Dept Comparat Biol & Expt Med, Fac Vet Med, 3330 Hosp Dr, Calgary, AB T2N 4N1, Canada.",janders@ucalgary.ca,,,,,,30,113,119,3,41,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,22-May,2008,453,7194,,,,,515,518,,10.1038/nature06865,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,303EL,WOS:000256023700041,18497824,No,,,11/20/17

Consequently ES-cell self-renewal is generally considered to be dependent on multifactorial stimulation of dedicated transcriptional circuitries, pre-eminent among which is the activation of STAT3 by cytokines (ref. 8). Here we show, however, that extrinsic stimuli are dispensable for the derivation, propagation and pluripotency of ES cells. Self-renewal is enabled by the elimination of differentiation-inducing signalling from mitogen-activated protein kinase. Additional inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase 3 consolidates biosynthetic capacity and suppresses residual differentiation. Complete bypass of cytokine signalling is confirmed by isolating ES cells genetically devoid of STAT3. These findings reveal that ES cells have an innate programme for self-replication that does not require extrinsic instruction. This property may account for their latent tumorigenicity. The delineation of minimal requirements for self-renewal now provides a defined platform for the precise description and dissection of the pluripotent state.","[Ying, Qi-Long] Univ So Calif, Ctr Stem Cell & Regenerat Med, Dept Cell & Neurobiol, Keck Sch Med, Los Angeles, CA 90033 USA; [Wray, Jason; Nichols, Jennifer; Batlle-Morera, Laura; Smith, Austin] Univ Cambridge, Wellcome Trust Ctr Stem Cell Res, Cambridge CB2 1QR, England; [Doble, Bradley] McMaster Univ, Mcmaster Stem Cell & Canc Res Inst, Hamilton, ON L8N 3Z5, Canada; [Woodgett, James] Mt Sinai Hosp, Samuel Lunenfeld Res Inst, Toronto, ON M5G 1X5, Canada; [Cohen, Philip] Univ Dundee, Div Signal Transduct Therapy, Dundee DD1 5EH, Scotland; [Cohen, Philip] Univ Dundee, MRC Prot Phosphorylat Unit, Dundee DD1 5EH, Scotland","Ying, QL (reprint author), Univ So Calif, Ctr Stem Cell & Regenerat Med, Dept Cell & Neurobiol, Keck Sch Med, 1501 San Pablo St,ZNI 529, Los Angeles, CA 90033 USA.",qying@keck.usc.edu; ags39@cscr.cam.ac.uk,"Woodgett, Jim/F-1087-2010; Doble, Bradley/L-7551-2016","Woodgett, Jim/0000-0003-3731-5797; Doble, Bradley/0000-0002-0260-2983; BATLLE MORERA, LAURA/0000-0002-6924-9002; Nichols, Jennifer/0000-0002-8650-1388; Smith, Austin/0000-0002-3029-4682","Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council [, G15381/2]; Canadian Institutes of Health Research [12043, 12858]; Medical Research Council [, G9806702, MC_U127084348]",,,36,1515,1554,25,236,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,22-May,2008,453,7194,,,,,519,U5,,10.1038/nature06968,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,303EL,WOS:000256023700042,18497825,No,Y,N,11/20/17

Studies in the mouse embryo and the mouse embryonic stem cell differentiation model have provided evidence indicating that these three lineages develop from a common Flk-1(+) (kinase insert domain protein receptor, also known as Kdr) cardiovascular progenitor that represents one of the earliest stages in mesoderm specification to the cardiovascular lineages(1). To determine whether a comparable progenitor is present during human cardiogenesis, we analysed the development of the cardiovascular lineages in human embryonic stem cell differentiation cultures. Here we show that after induction with combinations of activin A, bone morphogenetic protein 4 (BMP4), basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF, also known as FGF2), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF, also known as VEGFA) and dickkopf homolog 1 (DKK1) in serum-free media, human embryonic-stem-cell-derived embryoid bodies generate a KDR(low)/C-KIT (CD117)(neg) population that displays cardiac, endothelial and vascular smooth muscle potential in vitro and, after transplantation, in vivo. When plated in monolayer cultures, these KDR low/C-KIT neg cells differentiate to generate populations consisting of greater than 50% contracting cardiomyocytes. Populations derived from the KDR(low)/C-KIT(neg) fraction give rise to colonies that contain all three lineages when plated in methylcellulose cultures. Results from limiting dilution studies and cell-mixing experiments support the interpretation that these colonies are clones, indicating that they develop from a cardiovascular colonyforming cell. Together, these findings identify a human cardiovascular progenitor that defines one of the earliest stages of human cardiac development.","[Yang, Lei; Adler, Eric D.; Linden, R.

The main challenges in cancer biology are to identify cancer stem cells and to define the molecular events required for transforming normal cells to cancer stem cells. Here we show that Pten deletion in mouse haematopoietic stem cells leads to a myeloproliferative disorder, followed by acute T-lymphoblastic leukaemia (T-ALL). Self- renewable leukaemia stem cells (LSCs) are enriched in the c-Kit(mid)CD3(+)Lin(-) compartment, where unphosphorylated beta-catenin is significantly increased. Conditional ablation of one allele of the beta-catenin gene substantially decreases the incidence and delays the occurrence of T-ALL caused by Pten loss, indicating that activation of the beta-catenin pathway may contribute to the formation or expansion of the LSC population. Moreover, a recurring chromosomal translocation, T(14;15), results in aberrant overexpression of the c-myc oncogene in c-Kit mid CD3(+)Lin(-) LSCs and CD3(+) leukaemic blasts, recapitulating a subset of human T-ALL. No alterations in Notch1 signalling are detected in this model, suggesting that Pten inactivation and c-myc overexpression may substitute functionally for Notch1 abnormalities(2,3), leading to T-ALL development. Our study indicates that multiple genetic or molecular alterations contribute cooperatively to LSC transformation.","[Guo, Wei; Chang, Chun-Ju; Mosessian, Sherly; Lewis, Xiaoman; Chen, James Y.; Wu, Hong] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Mol & Med Pharmacol, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Lasky, Joseph L.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Pediat Hematol Oncol, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Iruela-Arispe, M.

Gene regulation by endogenous siRNAs has been observed only in organisms possessing RNA- dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP)(5-10). In mammals, where no RdRP activity has been found, biogenesis and function of endogenous siRNAs remain largely unknown. Here we show, using mouse oocytes, that endogenous siRNAs are derived from naturally occurring dsRNAs and have roles in the regulation of gene expression. By means of deep sequencing, we identify a large number of both similar to 25-27-nucleotide Piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) and similar to 21-nucleotide siRNAs corresponding to messenger RNAs or retrotransposons in growing oocytes. piRNAs are bound to Mili and have a role in the regulation of retrotransposons. siRNAs are exclusively mapped to retrotransposons or other genomic regions that produce transcripts capable of forming dsRNA structures. Inverted repeat structures, bidirectional transcription and antisense transcripts from various loci are sources of the dsRNAs. Some precursor transcripts of siRNAs are derived from expressed pseudogenes, indicating that one role of pseudogenes is to adjust the level of the founding source mRNA through RNAi. Loss of Dicer or Ago2 results in decreased levels of siRNAs and increased levels of retrotransposon and protein-coding transcripts complementary to the siRNAs. Thus, the RNAi pathway regulates both protein-coding transcripts and retrotransposons in mouse oocytes. Our results reveal a role for endogenous siRNAs in mammalian oocytes and show that organisms lacking RdRP activity can produce functional endogenous siRNAs from naturally occurring dsRNAs.","[Watanabe, Toshiaki; Chiba, Hatsune; Sasaki, Hiroyuki] Res Org Informat & Syst, Div Human Genet, Dept Integrated Genet, Natl Inst Genet, Mishima, Shizuoka 4118540, Japan; [Watanabe, Toshiaki; Chiba, Hatsune; Kohara, Yuji; Sasaki, Hiroyuki] Grad Univ Adv Studies, SOKENDAI, Dept Genet, Sch Life Sci, Mishima, Shizuoka 4118540, Japan; [Totoki, Yasushi; Sakaki, Yoshiyuki] RIKEN, Genome Sci Ctr, Genome Annotat & Comparat Anal Team, Computat & Expt Syst Biol Grp, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2300045, Japan; [Toyoda, Atsushi; Sakaki, Yoshiyuki] RIKEN, Genome Sci Ctr, Sequence Technol Team, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2300045, Japan; [Kaneda, Masahiro] Univ Cambridge, Wellcome Trust Canc Res UK Gurdon Inst Canc Dev B, Cambridge CB2 1QN, England; [Kaneda, Masahiro] Natl Agr & Food Res Org, Reprod Biol & Technol Res Team, Natl Inst Livestock & Grassland Sci, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3050901, Japan; [Kuramochi-Miyagawa, Satomi; Nakano, Toru] Osaka Univ, Dept Pathol, Grad Sch Med & Frontier Biosci, Suita, Osaka 5650871, Japan; [Obata, Yayoi; Kono, Tomohiro; Surani, M.

Such 'non-genetic cell individuality'(7) can arise from the slow fluctuations of protein levels(8) in mammalian cells. These fluctuations produce persistent cell individuality, thereby rendering a clonal population heterogeneous. However, it remains unknown whether this heterogeneity may account for the stochasticity of cell fate decisions in stem cells. Here we show that in clonal populations of mouse haematopoietic progenitor cells, spontaneous 'outlier' cells with either extremely high or low expression levels of the stem cell marker Sca-1 (also known as Ly6a; ref. 9) reconstitute the parental distribution of Sca-1 but do so only after more than one week. This slow relaxation is described by a gaussian mixture model that incorporates noise- driven transitions between discrete subpopulations, suggesting hidden multi-stability within one cell type. Despite clonality, the Sca-1 outliers had distinct transcriptomes. Although their unique gene expression profiles eventually reverted to that of the median cells, revealing an attractor state, they lasted long enough to confer a greatly different proclivity for choosing either the erythroid or the myeloid lineage. Preference in lineage choice was associated with increased expression of lineage-specific transcription factors, such as a > 200-fold increase in Gata1 (ref. 10) among the erythroid-prone cells, or a > 15-fold increased PU.1 (Sfpi1) (ref. 11) expression among myeloid-prone cells. Thus, clonal heterogeneity of gene expression level is not due to independent noise in the expression of individual genes, but reflects metastable states of a slowly fluctuating transcriptome that is distinct in individual cells and may govern the reversible, stochastic priming of multipotent progenitor cells in cell fate decision.","[Chang, Hannah H.; Ingber, Donald E.; Huang, Sui] Childrens Hosp, Vasc Biol Programme, Dept Pathol & Surg, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Chang, Hannah H.; Ingber, Donald E.; Huang, Sui] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Chang, Hannah H.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Program Biophys, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Chang, Hannah H.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, MD PhD Programme, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Hemberg, Martin; Barahona, Mauricio] Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Dept Bioengn, London SW7 2AZ, England; [Hemberg, Martin; Barahona, Mauricio] Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Inst Math Sci, London SW7 2AZ, England; [Ingber, Donald E.] Harvard Inst Biol Inspired Engn, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA","Huang, S (reprint author), Univ Calgary, Inst Biocomplex & Informat, Calgary, AB T2N 1N4, Canada.",sui.huang@ucalgary.ca,"Barahona, Mauricio/C-3638-2008","Barahona, Mauricio/0000-0002-1089-5675","NCI NIH HHS [P01 CA045548-210002, R21 CA123284, P01 CA045548]",,,25,575,585,7,61,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,22-May,2008,453,7194,,,,,544,U10,,10.1038/nature06965,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,303EL,WOS:000256023700047,18497826,No,Y,N,11/20/17

It is currently unclear how the proteasome recognizes its substrates, as the only established ubiquitin receptor intrinsic to the proteasome is Rpn10/S5a (ref. 1), which is not essential for ubiquitin- mediated protein degradation in budding yeast(2). In the accompanying manuscript we report that Rpn13 (refs 3-7), a component of the nine-subunit proteasome base, functions as a ubiquitin receptor(8), complementing its known role in docking de-ubiquitinating enzyme Uch37/UCHL5 (refs 4-6) to the proteasome. Here we merge crystallography and NMRdata to describe the ubiquitin-binding mechanism of Rpn13. We determine the structure of Rpn13 alone and complexed with ubiquitin. The co-complex reveals a novel ubiquitin-binding mode in which loops rather than secondary structural elements are used to capture ubiquitin. Further support for the role of Rpn13 as a proteasomal ubiquitin receptor is demonstrated by its ability to bind ubiquitin and proteasome subunit Rpn2/S1 simultaneously. Finally, we provide a model structure of Rpn13 complexed to diubiquitin, which provides insights into how Rpn13 as a ubiquitin receptor is coupled to substrate deubiquitination by Uch37.","[Schreiner, Patrick; Groll, Michael] Tech Univ Munich, Ctr Integrated Prot Sci, Dept Chem, Lehrstuhl Biochem, D-85747 Garching, Germany; [Chen, Xiang; Randles, Leah; Zhang, Naixia; Walters, Kylie J.] Univ Minnesota, Dept Biochem Mol Biol & Biophys, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA; [Husnjak, Koraljka; Dikic, Ivan] Univ Frankfurt, Inst Biochem 2, D-60590 Frankfurt, Germany; [Husnjak, Koraljka; Dikic, Ivan] Mediterranean Inst Life Sci, Tumor Biol Program, Split 21000, Croatia; [Elsasser, Suzanne; Finley, Daniel] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Cell Biol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Dikic, Ivan] Univ Split, Sch Med, Dept Immunol, Split 21000, Croatia; [Groll, Michael] Charite Univ Med Berlin CCM, Inst Biochem, D-10117 Berlin, Germany","Groll, M (reprint author), Tech Univ Munich, Ctr Integrated Prot Sci, Dept Chem, Lehrstuhl Biochem, Lichtenbergstr 4, D-85747 Garching, Germany.",ivan.dikic@biochem2.de; walte048@umn.edu; michael.groll@ch.tum.de,"Groll, Michael/C-1174-2010; Chen, Xiang/E-2840-2010; Groll, Michael/F-5572-2015; Dikic, Ivan/O-4650-2015; Husnjak, Koraljka/C-3717-2015","Dikic, Ivan/0000-0001-8156-9511; Husnjak, Koraljka/0000-0003-0573-6239","NCI NIH HHS [CA097004, R01 CA097004, R01 CA097004-05, R01 CA097004-06A1]; NIGMS NIH HHS [GM43601, GM008700, R01 GM043601, R37 GM043601, R37 GM043601-17, T32 GM008700, T32 GM008700-09]",,,28,192,198,2,27,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,22-May,2008,453,7194,,,,,548,552,,10.1038/nature06924,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,303EL,WOS:000256023700048,18497827,No,,,11/20/17

According to classical endosymbiosis theory, insertion of a host-nuclear-encoded MCF transporter into the protomitochondrion was the key step that allowed the host cell to harvest ATP from the enslaved endosymbiont(1). Notably the genome of the microsporidian Encephalitozoon cuniculi has lost all of its genes for MCF proteins(2). This raises the question of how the recently discovered microsporidian remnant mitochondrion, called a mitosome, acquires ATP to support protein import and other predicted ATP-dependent activities(2-4). The E. cuniculi genome does contain four genes for an unrelated type of nucleotide transporter used by plastids and bacterial intracellular parasites, such as Rickettsia and Chlamydia, to import ATP from the cytosol of their eukaryotic host cells(5-7). The inference is that E. cuniculi also uses these proteins to steal ATP from its eukaryotic host to sustain its lifestyle as an obligate intracellular parasite. Here we show that, consistent with this hypothesis, all four E. cuniculi transporters can transport ATP, and three of them are expressed on the surface of the parasite when it is living inside host cells. The fourth transporter co-locates with mitochondrial Hsp70 to the E. cuniculi mitosome. Thus, uniquely among eukaryotes, the traditional relationship between mitochondrion and host has been subverted in E. cuniculi, by reductive evolution and analogous gene replacement. Instead of the mitosome providing the parasite cytosol with ATP, the parasite cytosol now seems to provide ATP for the organelle.","[Tsaousis, Anastasios D.; Goldberg, Alina V.; Hirt, Robert P.; Embley, T.

Like Saccharomyces, Drosophila nucleosomes are organized around active transcription start sites in a canonical -1, nucleosome-free region, +1 arrangement. However, Drosophila does not incorporate H2A.Z into the -1 nucleosome and does not bury its transcriptional start site in the +1 nucleosome.

True polar wander, involving reorientation of Europa's floating outer ice shell about the tidal axis with Jupiter, has been proposed(2) as a possible explanation for some of the features. This mechanism is possible if the icy shell is latitudinally variable in thickness and decoupled from the rocky interior. It would impose high stress levels on the shell, leading to predictable fracture patterns(3). No satisfactory match to global-scale features has hitherto been found for polar wander stress patterns(3). Here we describe broad arcuate troughs and depressions on Europa that do not fit other proposed stress mechanisms in their current position. Using imaging from three spacecraft, we have mapped two global-scale organized concentric antipodal sets of arcuate troughs up to hundreds of kilometres long and 300 m to similar to 1.5 km deep. An excellent match to these features is found with stresses caused by an episode of 806 true polar wander. These depressions also appear to be geographically related to other large-scale bright and dark lineaments(4,5), suggesting that many of Europa's tectonic patterns may also be related to true polar wander.","[Schenk, Paul] Lunar & Planetary Inst, Houston, TX 77058 USA; [Matsuyama, Isamu] Carnegie Inst Washington, Dept Terr Magnetism, Washington, DC 20015 USA; [Nimmo, Francis] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA","Schenk, P (reprint author), Lunar & Planetary Inst, 3303 NASA Rd 1, Houston, TX 77058 USA.",schenk@lpi.usra.edu,,"Matsuyama, Isamu/0000-0002-2917-8633",,,,29,23,23,1,5,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,15-May,2008,453,7193,,,,,368,371,,10.1038/nature06911,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,301AI,WOS:000255868400046,18480819,No,,,11/20/17

The unique properties of polaritons - such as stimulated scattering(2,3), parametric amplification(4-6), lasing(7-10), condensation(11-13) and superfluidity(14,15) - are believed to provide the basis for a new generation of polariton emitters and semiconductor lasers. Until now, polariton lasing and nonlinearities have only been demonstrated in optical experiments, which have shown the potential to reduce lasing thresholds by two orders of magnitude compared to conventional semiconductor lasers(16). Here we report an experimental realization of an electrically pumped semiconductor polariton light-emitting device, which emits directly from polariton states at a temperature of 235 K.

Furthermore, a large increase in the midpoint T-c of up to similar to 26 K has been realized(4) in the isocrystalline compound LaOFeAs on doping of fluoride ions at the O2- sites (LaO1-xFxFeAs). Experimental observations(5,6) and theoretical studies(7-9) suggest that these transitions are related to a magnetic instability, as is the case for most superconductors based on transition metals. In the copper-based high-temperature superconductors, as well as in LaOFeAs, an increase in T-c is often observed as a result of carrier doping in the two-dimensional electronic structure through ion substitution in the surrounding insulating layers, suggesting that the application of external pressure should further increase T-c by enhancing charge transfer between the insulating and conducting layers. The effects of pressure on these iron oxypnictide superconductors may be more prominent than those in the copper-based systems, because the As ion has a greater electronic polarizability, owing to the covalency of the Fe-As chemical bond, and, thus, is more compressible than the divalent O2- ion. Here we report that increasing the pressure causes a steep increase in the onset T-c of F-doped LaOFeAs, to a maximum of similar to 43 K at similar to 4 GPa. With the exception of the copper-based high-T-c superconductors, this is the highest T-c reported to date. The present result, together with the great freedom available in selecting the constituents of isocrystalline materials with the general formula LnOTMPn (Ln, Y or rare-earth metal; TM, transition metal; Pn, group-V, 'pnicogen', element), indicates that the layered iron oxypnictides are promising as a new material platform for further exploration of high-temperature superconductivity.","[Takahashi, Hiroki; Igawa, Kazumi; Arii, Kazunobu] Nihon Univ, Dept Phys, Coll Humanities & Sci, Setagaya Ku, Tokyo 1568550, Japan; [Kamihara, Yoichi; Hirano, Masahiro; Hosono, Hideo] Tokyo Inst Technol, ERATO SORST, JST, Midori Ku, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2268503, Japan; [Hirano, Masahiro; Hosono, Hideo] Tokyo Inst Technol, Frontier Res Ctr, Midori Ku, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2268503, Japan","Takahashi, H (reprint author), Nihon Univ, Dept Phys, Coll Humanities & Sci, Setagaya Ku, Tokyo 1568550, Japan.",hiroki@chs.nihon-u.ac.jp,"Kamihara, Yoichi/C-4471-2008; Hosono, Hideo/J-3489-2013","Hosono, Hideo/0000-0001-9260-6728",,,,17,893,912,14,284,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,15-May,2008,453,7193,,,,,376,378,,10.1038/nature06972,,3,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,301AI,WOS:000255868400048,18432191,No,Y,N,11/20/17

Its concentrations over the past 650,000 years have varied between similar to 350 and similar to 800 parts per 10 9 by volume ( p. p. b. v.) during glacial and interglacial periods, respectively(2).

Here we present a detailed atmospheric methane record from the EPICA Dome C ice core that extends the history of this greenhouse gas to 800,000 yr before present. The average time resolution of the new data is similar to 380 yr and permits the identification of orbital and millennial-scale features. Spectral analyses indicate that the long-term variability in atmospheric methane levels is dominated by,100,000 yr glacial - interglacial cycles up to,400,000 yr ago with an increasing contribution of the precessional component during the four more recent climatic cycles. We suggest that changes in the strength of tropical methane sources and sinks ( wetlands, atmospheric oxidation), possibly influenced by changes in monsoon systems and the position of the intertropical convergence zone, controlled the atmospheric methane budget, with an additional source input during major terminations as the retreat of the northern ice sheet allowed higher methane emissions from extending periglacial wetlands. Millennial-scale changes in methane levels identified in our record as being associated with Antarctic isotope maxima events(1,4) are indicative of ubiquitous millennial-scale temperature variability during the past eight glacial cycles.","[Loulergue, Laetitia; Lemieux, Benedicte; Barnola, Jean-Marc; Raynaud, Dominique; Chappellaz, Jerome] Univ Grenoble 1, CNRS, Lab Glaciol & Geophys Environm, F-38402 St Martin Dheres, France; [Schilt, Adrian; Spahni, Renato; Blunier, Thomas; Stocker, Thomas F.] Univ Bern, Inst Phys, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland; [Masson-Delmotte, Valerie] Univ Versailles St Quentin, Lab Sci Climat & Environm, Inst Pierre Simon Laplace, CE Saclay,CEA CNRS, F-91191 Gif Sur Yvette, France","Chappellaz, J (reprint author), Univ Grenoble 1, CNRS, Lab Glaciol & Geophys Environm, 54 Rue Moliere, F-38402 St Martin Dheres, France.",jerome@lgge.obs.ujf-grenoble.fr,"Chappellaz, Jerome/A-4872-2011; Masson-Delmotte, Valerie/G-1995-2011; Stocker, Thomas/B-1273-2013; Blunier, Thomas/M-4609-2014; Raynaud, Dominique/H-9626-2016","Masson-Delmotte, Valerie/0000-0001-8296-381X; Blunier, Thomas/0000-0002-6065-7747; ",,,,27,371,389,12,151,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,15-May,2008,453,7193,,,,,383,386,,10.1038/nature06950,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,301AI,WOS:000255868400050,18480822,No,Y,N,11/20/17

Birds in particular have been intensively studied, but the biophysical mechanisms that underlie the avian magnetic compass are still poorly understood. One proposal, based on magnetically sensitive free radical reactions(2,3), is gaining support(4-11) despite the fact that no chemical reaction in vitro has been shown to respond to magnetic fields as weak as the Earth's (similar to 50 mu T) or to be sensitive to the direction of such a field. Here we use spectroscopic observation of a carotenoid-porphyrin-fullerene model system to demonstrate that the lifetime of a photochemically formed radical pair is changed by application of <= 50 mu T magnetic fields, and to measure the anisotropic chemical response that is essential for its operation as a chemical compass sensor.

The metal hyperaccumulator Arabidopsis halleri has the rare ability to colonize heavy-metal-polluted soils, and, as an extremophile sister species of Arabidopsis thaliana, it is a powerful model for research on adaptation(1-3). A. halleri naturally accumulates and tolerates leaf concentrations as high as 2.2% zinc and 0.28% cadmium in dry biomass(4). On the basis of transcriptomics studies, metal hyperaccumulation in A. halleri has been associated with more than 30 candidate genes that are expressed at higher levels in A. halleri than in A. thaliana(4-6). Some of these genes have been genetically mapped to broad chromosomal segments of between 4 and 24 cM co-segregating with Zn and Cd hypertolerance(7-9). However, the in planta loss-of-function approaches required to demonstrate the contribution of a given candidate gene to metal hyperaccumulation or hypertolerance have not been pursued to date. Using RNA interference to downregulate HMA4 (HEAVY METAL ATPASE 4) expression, we show here that Zn hyperaccumulation and full hypertolerance to Cd and Zn in A. halleri depend on the metal pump HMA4. Contrary to a postulated global trans regulatory factor governing high expression of numerous metal hyperaccumulation genes, we demonstrate that enhanced expression of HMA4 in A. halleri is attributable to a combination of modified cis-regulatory sequences and copy number expansion, in comparison to A. thaliana. Transfer of an A. halleri HMA4 gene to A. thaliana recapitulates Zn partitioning into xylem vessels and the constitutive transcriptional upregulation of Zn deficiency response genes characteristic of Zn hyperaccumulators. Our results demonstrate the importance of cis-regulatory mutations and gene copy number expansion in the evolution of a complex naturally selected extreme trait(10). The elucidation of a natural strategy for metal hyperaccumulation enables the rational design of technologies for the clean-up of metal-contaminated soils and for bio-fortification.","[Hanikenne, Marc; Talke, Ina N.; Haydon, Michael J.; Nolte, Andrea; Kraemer, Ute] Max Planck Inst Mol Plant Physiol, D-14476 Potsdam, Germany; [Lanz, Christa; Weigel, Detlef] Max Planck Inst Dev Biol, D-72076 Tubingen, Germany; [Motte, Patrick] Univ Liege, Dept Life Sci, B-4000 Liege, Belgium; [Motte, Patrick] Univ Liege, Ctr Assistance Technol Microscopy, Dept Chem, B-4000 Liege, Belgium; [Kroymann, Juergen] Max Planck Inst Chem Ecol, D-07745 Jena, Germany","Kramer, U (reprint author), Univ Heidelberg, BIOQUANT Ctr, Heidelberg Inst Plant Sci, D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany.",ute.kraemer@bioquant.uni-heidelberg.de,"Weigel, Detlef/C-1418-2008; Kraemer, Ute/C-5025-2008; Kroymann, Juergen/B-4317-2013; Haydon, Michael/B-9326-2014","Weigel, Detlef/0000-0002-2114-7963; Kraemer, Ute/0000-0001-7870-4508; Haydon, Michael/0000-0003-2486-9387; Kroymann, Juergen/0000-0002-4573-6498",,,,38,363,379,7,199,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,15-May,2008,453,7193,,,,,391,U44,,10.1038/nature06877,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,301AI,WOS:000255868400052,18425111,No,Y,N,11/20/17

We use a large-scale exploratory analytical approach to investigate metabolic phenotype variation across and within four human populations, based on H-1 NMR spectroscopy. Metabolites discriminating across populations are then linked to data for individuals on blood pressure, a major risk factor for coronary heart disease and stroke (leading causes of mortality worldwide(4)). We analyse spectra from two 24-hour urine specimens for each of 4,630 participants from the INTERMAP epidemiological study(5), involving 17 population samples aged 40-59 in China, Japan, UK and USA. We show that urinary metabolite excretion patterns for East Asian and western population samples, with contrasting diets, diet-related major risk factors, and coronary heart disease/stroke rates, are significantly differentiated (P < 10(-16)), as are Chinese/Japanese metabolic phenotypes, and subgroups with differences in dietary vegetable/animal protein and blood pressure(6). Among discriminatory metabolites, we quantify four and show association (P < 0.05 to P < 0.0001) of mean 24-hour urinary formate excretion with blood pressure in multiple regression analyses for individuals. Mean 24-hour urinary excretion of alanine (direct) and hippurate (inverse), reflecting diet and gut microbial activities(2,7), are also associated with blood pressure of individuals.

Fibroblast growth factor (FGF) gene family members are key AER-derived signals(3,4), with Fgf4, Fgf8, Fgf9 and Fgf17 expressed specifically in the mouse AER(5). Here we demonstrate that mouse limbs lacking Fgf4, Fgf9 and Fgf17 have normal skeletal pattern, indicating that Fgf8 is sufficient among AER-FGFs to sustain normal limb formation. Inactivation of Fgf8 alone causes a mild skeletal phenotype(6,7); however, when we also removed different combinations of the other AER-FGF genes, we obtained unexpected skeletal phenotypes of increasing severity, reflecting the contribution that each FGF can make to the total AER-FGF signal. Analysis of the compound mutant limb buds revealed that, in addition to sustaining cell survival, AER-FGFs regulate P-D-patterning gene expression during early limb bud development, providing genetic evidence that AER-FGFs function to specify a distal domain and challenging the long-standing hypothesis that AER-FGF signalling is permissive rather than instructive for limb patterning. We discuss how a two-signal model for P-D patterning can be integrated with the concept of early specification to explain the genetic data presented here.","[Mariani, Francesca V.; Ahn, Christina P.; Martin, Gail R.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Anat, Sch Med, San Francisco, CA 94158 USA; [Mariani, Francesca V.; Ahn, Christina P.; Martin, Gail R.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Program Dev Biol, Sch Med, San Francisco, CA 94158 USA","Martin, GR (reprint author), Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Anat, Sch Med, San Francisco, CA 94158 USA.",gail.r.martin@ucsf.edu,,,"NICHD NIH HHS [R01 HD034380-08, F32 HD008696, F32 HD008696-01, F32 HD008696-02, F32 HD008696-03, R01 HD034380, R01 HD034380-05, R01 HD034380-06, R01 HD034380-07, R01 HD034380-09, R01 HD34380]",,,31,187,191,2,28,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,15-May,2008,453,7193,,,,,401,U56,,10.1038/nature06876,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,301AI,WOS:000255868400054,18449196,No,,,11/20/17

Planning movements to select an alternative involves several areas in frontal and parietal cortex(1-11) that are anatomically connected into long-range circuits(12). These areas must coordinate their activity to select a common movement goal, but how neural circuits make decisions remains poorly understood. Here we simultaneously record from the dorsal premotor area (PMd) in frontal cortex and the parietal reach region (PRR) in parietal cortex to investigate neural circuit mechanisms for decision making. We find that correlations in spike and local field potential (LFP) activity between these areas are greater when monkeys are freely making choices than when they are following instructions. We propose that a decision circuit featuring a sub-population of cells in frontal and parietal cortex may exchange information to coordinate activity between these areas. Cells participating in this decision circuit may influence movement choices by providing a common bias to the selection of movement goals.","[Pesaran, Bijan] NYU, Ctr Neural Sci, New York, NY 10003 USA; [Nelson, Matthew J.; Andersen, Richard A.] CALTECH, Computat & Neural Syst Program, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA; [Pesaran, Bijan; Andersen, Richard A.] CALTECH, Div Biol, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA","Pesaran, B (reprint author), NYU, Ctr Neural Sci, 550 1St Ave, New York, NY 10003 USA.",bijan@nyu.edu,,"Pesaran, Bijan/0000-0003-4116-0038; Nelson, Matthew/0000-0002-2325-4578","NEI NIH HHS [R01 EY007492, R01 EY007492-19]",,,30,229,232,1,21,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,15-May,2008,453,7193,,,,,406,U61,,10.1038/nature06849,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,301AI,WOS:000255868400055,18418380,No,,,11/20/17

Constant vessel remodelling leads to spontaneous haemorrhages(2) and increased interstitial fluid pressure in the tumour environment(3,4). Tumour-related angiogenesis supports tumour growth and is also a major obstacle for successful immune therapy as it prevents migration of immune effector cells into established tumour parenchyma(2,5,6). The molecular mechanisms for these angiogenic alterations are largely unknown. Here we identify regulator of G-protein signalling 5 (Rgs5) as a master gene responsible for the abnormal tumour vascular morphology in mice. Loss of Rgs5 results in pericyte maturation, vascular normalization and consequent marked reductions in tumour hypoxia and vessel leakiness. These vascular and intratumoral changes enhance influx of immune effector cells into tumour parenchyma and markedly prolong survival of tumour-bearing mice. This is the first demonstration, to our knowledge, of reduced tumour angiogenesis and improved immune therapeutic outcome on loss of a vascular gene function and establishes a previously unrecognized role of G-protein signalling in tumour angiogenesis.","[Hamzah, Juliana; Manzur, Mitali; Ganss, Ruth] Univ Western Australia, Med Res Ctr, Western Australian Inst Med Res, Perth, WA 6000, Australia; [Jugold, Manfred; Kiessling, Fabian] German Canc Res Ctr, Juniorgrp Mol Imaging, Dept Med Phys Radiol, D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany; [Kaden, Sylvia; Groene, Hermann-Josef] German Canc Res Ctr, Dept Cellular & Mol Pathol, D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany; [Haemmerling, Guenter J.; Arnold, Bernd] German Canc Res Ctr, Dept Mol Immunol, D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany; [Rigby, Paul] Univ Western Australia, Ctr Microscopy Characterisat & Anal, Perth, WA 6000, Australia; [Marti, Hugo H.; Rabie, Tamer] Univ Heidelberg, Inst Physiol & Pathophysiol, D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany","Ganss, R (reprint author), Univ Western Australia, Med Res Ctr, Western Australian Inst Med Res, Perth, WA 6000, Australia.",ganss@waimr.uwa.edu.au,"Rigby, Paul/G-5248-2012; Rabie, Tamer/C-7886-2013; hamzah, juliana/G-3114-2013","Rabie, Tamer/0000-0001-9060-8797; Ganss, Ruth/0000-0002-5551-045X",,,,30,260,272,2,23,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,15-May,2008,453,7193,,,,,410,U67,,10.1038/nature06868,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,301AI,WOS:000255868400056,18418378,No,Y,N,11/20/17

Biochemical data have shown that the amino-terminal 79 residues of the CPV turret protein (TP) is sufficient to bring CPV or engineered proteins into the polyhedrin matrix for micro-encapsulation(5,6). Here we report the three-dimensional structure of CPV at 3.88 angstrom resolution using single-particle cryo-electron microscopy. Our map clearly shows the turns and deep grooves of alpha-helices, the strand separation in beta-sheets, and densities for loops and many bulky side chains; thus permitting atomic model-building effort from cryoelectron microscopy maps. We observed a helix-to-beta-hairpin conformational change between the two conformational states of the capsid shell protein in the region directly interacting with genomic RNA. We have also discovered a messenger RNA release hole coupled with the mRNA capping machinery unique to CPV. Furthermore, we have identified the polyhedrin-binding domain, a structure that has potential in nanobiotechnology applications.","[Yu, Xuekui; Jin, Lei; Zhou, Z.

This monotreme exhibits a fascinating combination of reptilian and mammalian characters. For example, platypuses have a coat of fur adapted to an aquatic lifestyle; platypus females lactate, yet lay eggs; and males are equipped with venom similar to that of reptiles. Analysis of the first monotreme genome aligned these features with genetic innovations. We find that reptile and platypus venom proteins have been co- opted independently from the same gene families; milk protein genes are conserved despite platypuses laying eggs; and immune gene family expansions are directly related to platypus biology. Expansions of protein, non- protein- coding RNA and microRNA families, as well as repeat elements, are identified. Sequencing of this genome now provides a valuable resource for deep mammalian comparative analyses, as well as for monotreme biology and conservation.","[Warren, Wesley C.; Hillier, LaDeana W.; Chinwalla, Asif T.; Yang, Shiaw-Pyng; Locke, Devin P.; Fulton, Lucinda; Fulton, Bob; Graves, Tina; Wallis, John; Nelson, Joanne; Hallsworth-Pepin, Kym; Delehaunty, Kim; Markovic, Chris; Minx, Pat; Feng, Yucheng; Kremitzki, Colin; Mitreva, Makedonka; Glasscock, Jarret; Wylie, Todd; Wohldmann, Patricia; Thiru, Prathapan; Nhan, Michael N.; Pohl, Craig S.; Smith, Scott M.; Hou, Shunfeng; Mardis, Elaine R.; Wilson, Richard K.] Washington Univ, Sch Med, Genome Sequencing Ctr, St Louis, MO 63108 USA; [Graves, Jennifer A.

This task requires the reverse transcriptase to discriminate a variety of nucleic- acid substrates such that active sites of the enzyme are correctly positioned to support one of three catalytic functions: RNA- directed DNA synthesis, DNA- directed DNA synthesis and DNA- directed RNA hydrolysis. However, the mechanism by which substrates regulate reverse transcriptase activities remains unclear. Here we report distinct orientational dynamics of reverse transcriptase observed on different substrates with a single- molecule assay. The enzyme adopted opposite binding orientations on duplexes containing DNA or RNA primers, directing its DNA synthesis or RNA hydrolysis activity, respectively. On duplexes containing the unique polypurine RNA primers for plus- strand DNA synthesis, the enzyme can rapidly switch between the two orientations. The switching kinetics were regulated by cognate nucleotides and non- nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, a major class of anti- HIV drugs. These results indicate that the activities of reverse transcriptase are determined by its binding orientation on substrates.","[Abbondanzieri, Elio A.; Bokinsky, Gregory; Zhang, Jennifer X.; Zhuang, Xiaowei] Harvard Univ, Dept Chem & Biol Chem, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Zhuang, Xiaowei] Harvard Univ, Dept Phys, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Zhuang, Xiaowei] Harvard Univ, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Rausch, Jason W.; Le Grice, Stuart F.

Here we describe the computational design of eight enzymes that use two different catalytic motifs to catalyse the Kemp elimination - a model reaction for proton transfer from carbon - with measured rate enhancements of up to 10 5 and multiple turnovers. Mutational analysis confirms that catalysis depends on the computationally designed active sites, and a high- resolution crystal structure suggests that the designs have close to atomic accuracy.

It is very difficult to model these effects and, therefore, observations are essential to advancing our understanding of atmospheres. The equatorial stratospheres of Earth and Jupiter oscillate quasi- periodically on timescales of about two and four years, respectively, driven by wave- induced momentum transport(1-5). On Venus and Titan, waves originating from surface atmosphere interaction and inertial instability are thought to drive the atmosphere to rotate more rapidly than the surface ( superrotation). However, the relevant wave modes have not yet been precisely identified. Here we report infrared observations showing that Saturn has an equatorial oscillation like those found on Earth and Jupiter, as well as a mid- latitude subsidence that may be associated with the equatorial motion. The latitudinal extent of Saturn's oscillation shows that it obeys the same basic physics as do those on Earth and Jupiter. Future highly resolved observations of the temperature profile together with modelling of these three different atmospheres will allow us determine the wave mode, the wavelength and the wave amplitude that lead to middle atmosphere oscillation.","[Fouchet, T.; Guerlet, S.; Bezard, B.] Univ Paris 06, Observ Paris, CNRS, LESIA, F-92195 Meudon, France; [Strobel, D.

Such complex multi- spin systems provide attractive targets for the study of quantum effects at the mesoscopic scale. In these molecules, the large energy barriers between collective spin states can be crossed by thermal activation or quantum tunnelling, depending on the temperature or an applied magnetic field(2-4). There is the hope that these mesoscopic spin states can be harnessed for the realization of quantum bits 'qubits', the basic building blocks of a quantum computer - based on molecular magnets(5-8). But strong decoherence(9) must be overcome if the envisaged applications are to become practical. Here we report the observation and analysis of Rabi oscillations ( quantum oscillations resulting from the coherent absorption and emission of photons driven by an electromagnetic wave(10)) of a molecular magnet in a hybrid system, in which discrete and well-separated magnetic V-15(IV) clusters are embedded in a self- organized non- magnetic environment. Each cluster contains 15 antiferromagnetically coupled S = 1/ 2 spins, leading to an S = 1/ 2 collective ground state(11-13). When this system is placed into a resonant cavity, the microwave field induces oscillatory transitions between the ground and excited collective spin states, indicative of long-lived quantum coherence. The present observation of quantum oscillations suggests that low- dimension self- organized qubit networks having coherence times of the order of 100 mu s ( at liquid helium temperatures) are a realistic prospect.","[Bertaina, S.; Barbara, B.] CNRS, Inst Neel, F-38042 Grenoble 9, France; [Gambarelli, S.; Barbara, B.] CEA Grenoble, INAC, UMR CEA UJF E3, Lab Chim Inorgan & Biol, F-38054 Grenoble 9, France; [Mitra, T.; Mueller, A.] Univ Bielefeld, Fak Chem, D-33501 Bielefeld, Germany; [Tsukerblat, B.] Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Dept Chem, IL-84105 Beer Sheva, Israel","Barbara, B (reprint author), CNRS, Inst Neel, 25 Ave Martyrs,BP166, F-38042 Grenoble 9, France.",a.mueller@uni-bielefeld.de; bernard.barbara@grenoble.cnrs.fr,"Bertaina, Sylvain/B-6841-2008; Mitra, Tamoghna/L-7358-2017","Bertaina, Sylvain/0000-0002-6466-8830; Mitra, Tamoghna/0000-0002-1649-6667; Muller, Achim/0000-0003-0117-4021",,,,30,235,235,4,62,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,8-May,2008,453,7192,,,,,203,U5,,10.1038/nature06962,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,297BP,WOS:000255592400035,18464738,No,Y,N,11/20/17

A striking feature of these materials is that the structure adopted by a given ZIF is determined by link - link interactions, rather than by the structure directing agents used in zeolite synthesis(2). As a result, systematic variations of linker substituents have yielded many different ZIFs that exhibit known or predicted zeolite topologies. The materials are chemically and thermally stable, yet have the long- sought- after design flexibility offered by functionalized organic links and a high density of transition metal ions(1-7) . Here we report the synthesis and characterization of two porous ZIFs-ZIF-95 and ZIF-100-with structures of a scale and complexity previously unknown in zeolites(8-10). The materials have complex cages that contain up to 264 vertices, and are constructed from as many as 7,524 atoms. As expected from the adsorption selectivity recently documented for other members of this materials family(3), both ZIFs selectively capture carbon dioxide from several different gas mixtures at room temperature, with ZIF-100 capable of storing 28 litres per litre of material at standard temperature and pressure. These characteristics, combined with their high thermal and chemical stability and ease of fabrication, make ZIFs promising candidate materials for strategies aimed at ameliorating increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide levels.","[Wang, Bo; Cote, Adrien P.; Furukawa, Hiroyasu; Yaghi, Omar M.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Chem & Biochem, Ctr Reticular Chem, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [O'Keeffe, Michael] Arizona State Univ, Dept Chem & Biochem, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA","Yaghi, OM (reprint author), Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Chem & Biochem, Ctr Reticular Chem, 607 E Charles E Young Dr, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.",yaghi@chem.ucla.edu,"yarasi, soujanya/F-5531-2011; WANG, BO/D-9762-2012; Furukawa, Hiroyasu/C-5910-2008","WANG, BO/0000-0001-9092-3252; Furukawa, Hiroyasu/0000-0002-6082-1738; Yaghi, Omar/0000-0002-5611-3325",,,,28,906,919,53,688,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,8-May,2008,453,7192,,,,,207,U6,,10.1038/nature06900,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,297BP,WOS:000255592400036,18464739,No,Y,N,11/20/17

This region ( Amazonia) is also estimated to contain about one-tenth of the total carbon stored in land ecosystems, and to account for one-tenth of global, net primary productivity(1). The resilience of the forest to the combined pressures of deforestation and global warming is therefore of great concern(2), especially as some general circulation models ( GCMs) predict a severe drying of Amazonia in the twenty- first century(3-5). Here we analyse these climate projections with reference to the 2005 drought in western Amazonia, which was associated(6) with unusually warm North Atlantic sea surface temperatures ( SSTs). We show that reduction of dry-season ( July - October) rainfall in western Amazonia correlates well with an index of the north - south SST gradient across the equatorial Atlantic ( the 'Atlantic N - S gradient'). Our climate model is unusual among current GCMs in that it is able to reproduce this relationship and also the observed twentieth- century multidecadal variability in the Atlantic N - S gradient(7), provided that the effects of aerosols are included in the model(8). Simulations for the twenty- first century using the same model(3,8) show a strong tendency for the SST conditions associated with the 2005 drought to become much more common, owing to continuing reductions in reflective aerosol pollution in the Northern Hemisphere(9).","[Cox, Peter M.; Jupp, Tim E.] Univ Exeter, Sch Engn Comp & Math, Exeter EX4 4QF, Devon, England; [Cox, Peter M.; Betts, Richard A.; Collins, Matthew; Jones, Chris D.] Met Off Hadley Ctr, Exeter EX1 3PB, Devon, England; [Harris, Phil P.; Huntingford, Chris] Ctr Ecol & Hydrol, Wallingford OX10 8BB, Oxon, England; [Marengo, Jose A.; Nobre, Carlos A.] INPE, CPTEC, Brazilian Ctr Weather Forecasting & Climate Studi, Sao Paulo, Brazil","Cox, PM (reprint author), Univ Exeter, Sch Engn Comp & Math, Exeter EX4 4QF, Devon, England.",p.m.cox@exeter.ac.uk,"Harris, Phil/A-1933-2010; Marengo, Jose /J-9382-2012; Collins, Matthew/F-8473-2011; Betts, Richard/P-8976-2015; Cox, Peter/B-3299-2012; Jones, Chris/I-2983-2014; Huntingford, Chris/A-4307-2008","Harris, Phil/0000-0002-4834-7746; Marengo, Jose /0000-0002-8154-2762; Collins, Matthew/0000-0003-3785-6008; Huntingford, Chris/0000-0002-5941-7770",,,,29,191,199,7,117,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,8-May,2008,453,7192,,,,,212,U7,,10.1038/nature06960,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,297BP,WOS:000255592400037,18464740,No,Y,N,11/20/17

Species richness along altitudinal gradients was previously assumed to increase universally from cool highlands to warm lowlands, mirroring the latitudinal increase in species richness from cool to warm latitudes(1,4,5). However, since the more recent general acceptance of altitudinal gradients as model templates for testing hypotheses behind large- scale patterns of diversity(5-9), these gradients have been used in support of all the main diversity hypotheses, although little consensus has been achieved. Here we show that when resampling a data set comprising 400,000 records for 3,046 Pyrenean floristic species at different scales of analysis ( achieved by varying grain size and the extent of the gradients sampled), the derived species richness pattern changed progressively from hump- shaped to a monotonic pattern as the scale of extent diminished. Scale effects alone gave rise to as many conflicting patterns of species richness as had previously been reported in the literature, and scale effects lent significantly different statistical support to competing diversity hypotheses. Effects of scale on current studies may be affected by human activities, because montane ecosystems and human activities are intimately connected(10). This interdependence has led to a global reduction in natural lowland habitats, hampering our ability to detect universal patterns and impeding the search for universal diversity gradients to discover the mechanisms determining the distribution of biological diversity on Earth.","[Nogues-Bravo, D.; Araujo, M.

Here we show that fish diversity patterns throughout the Mississippi - Missouri River System are well described by a neutral metacommunity model coupled with an appropriate habitat capacity distribution and dispersal kernel. River network structure acts as an effective template for characterizing spatial attributes of fish biodiversity. We show that estimates of average dispersal behaviour and habitat capacities, objectively calculated from average runoff production, yield reliable predictions of large- scale spatial biodiversity patterns in riverine systems. The success of the neutral theory in two- dimensional forest ecosystems(6-8) and here in dendritic riverine ecosystems suggests the possible application of neutral metacommunity models in a diverse suite of ecosystems.

Here we show that REST maintains self- renewal and pluripotency in mouse ES cells through suppression of the microRNA miR- 21. We found that, as with known self- renewal markers, the level of REST expression is much higher in self- renewing mouse ES cells than in differentiating mouse ES ( embryoid body, EB) cells. Heterozygous deletion of Rest ( Rest(+/-)) and its short- interfering-RNA- mediated knockdown in mouse ES cells cause a loss of self- renewal - even when these cells are grown under self- renewal conditions - and lead to the expression of markers specific for multiple lineages. Conversely, exogenously added REST maintains self- renewal in mouse EB cells. Furthermore, Rest(+/-) mouse ES cells cultured under self- renewal conditions express substantially reduced levels of several self- renewal regulators, including Oct4 ( also called Pou5f1), Nanog, Sox2 and c- Myc, and exogenously added REST in mouse EB cells maintains the self- renewal phenotypes and expression of these self- renewal regulators. We also show that in mouse ES cells, REST is bound to the gene chromatin of a set of miRNAs that potentially target self- renewal genes. Whereas mouse ES cells and mouse EB cells containing exogenously added REST express lower levels of these miRNAs, EB cells, Rest(+/-) ES cells and ES cells treated with short interfering RNA targeting Rest express higher levels of these miRNAs. At least one of these REST- regulated miRNAs, miR- 21, specifically suppresses the self- renewal of mouse ES cells, corresponding to the decreased expression of Oct4, Nanog, Sox2 and c- Myc. Thus, REST is a newly discovered element of the interconnected regulatory network that maintains the self- renewal and pluripotency of mouse ES cells.","[Singh, Sanjay K.; Kagalwala, Mohamedi N.; Adams, Henry; Majumder, Sadhan] Univ Texas MD Anderson Canc Ctr, Dept Canc Genet, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Parker-Thornburg, Jan] Univ Texas MD Anderson Canc Ctr, Dept Biochem & Mol Biol, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Majumder, Sadhan] Univ Texas MD Anderson Canc Ctr, Dept Neurooncol, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Majumder, Sadhan] Univ Texas MD Anderson Canc Ctr, Brain Tumor Ctr, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Singh, Sanjay K.; Kagalwala, Mohamedi N.; Majumder, Sadhan] Univ Texas MD Anderson Canc Ctr, Ctr Stem Cell & Dev Biol, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Majumder, Sadhan] Univ Texas Houston, Grad Sch Biomed Sci, Program Genes & Dev, Houston, TX 77030 USA","Majumder, S (reprint author), Univ Texas MD Anderson Canc Ctr, Dept Canc Genet, Houston, TX 77030 USA.",smajumder@mdanderson.org,,,"NCI NIH HHS [R01 CA081255, CA81255, CA97124, R01 CA081255-10, R01 CA097124, R01 CA097124-07]",,,24,201,217,1,25,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,8-May,2008,453,7192,,,,,223,U11,,10.1038/nature06863,,7,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,297BP,WOS:000255592400040,18362916,No,,,11/20/17

HSCs maintain themselves for the lifetime of the organism because of their ability to self- renew. However, multipotent progenitors lack the ability to self- renew, therefore their mitotic capacity and expansion potential are limited and they are destined to eventually stop proliferating after a finite number of cell divisions(1,2). The molecular mechanisms that limit the proliferation capacity of multipotent progenitors and other more mature progenitors are not fully understood(2,3). Here we show that bone marrow cells from mice deficient in three genes genetically downstream of Bmi1-p16(Ink4a), p19(Arf) and Trp53 ( triple mutant mice; p16(Ink4a) and p19(Arf) are alternative reading frames of the same gene ( also called Cdkn2a) that encode different proteins) - have an approximately 10-fold increase in cells able to reconstitute the blood long term. This increase is associated with the acquisition of long- term reconstitution capacity by cells of the phenotype c-kit(+)Sca-1(+)Flt3(+)CD150(-)CD48(-)Lin(-), which defines multipotent progenitors in wild- type mice(4-6). The pattern of triple mutant multipotent progenitor response to growth factors resembles that of wild- type multipotent progenitors but not wild- type HSCs. These results demonstrate that p16(Ink4a)/p19(Arf) and Trp53 have a central role in limiting the expansion potential of multipotent progenitors. These pathways are commonly repressed in cancer, suggesting a mechanism by which early progenitor cells could gain the ability to self- renew and become malignant with further oncogenic mutations.","[Akala, Omobolaji O.; Qian, Dalong; Clarke, Michael F.] Stanford Univ, Stanford Inst Stem Cell Biol & Regenerat Med, Palo Alto, CA 94304 USA; [Akala, Omobolaji O.] Univ Michigan, Cellular & Mol Biol Grad Program, Taubman Med Lib 2966, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Akala, Omobolaji O.; Qian, Dalong; Clarke, Michael F.] Stanford Univ, Div Hematol Oncol, Palo Alto, CA 94304 USA; [Park, In-Kyung; Pihalja, Michael] Univ Michigan, Dept Hematol Oncol, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Becker, Michael W.] Univ Rochester, Div Hematol Oncol, Rochester, NY 14642 USA","Clarke, MF (reprint author), Stanford Univ, Stanford Inst Stem Cell Biol & Regenerat Med, 1050 Arastradero Rd, Palo Alto, CA 94304 USA.",mfclarke@stanford.edu,,"Becker, Michael/0000-0001-9890-8815",,,,27,108,109,0,5,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,8-May,2008,453,7192,,,,,228,U12,,10.1038/nature06869,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,297BP,WOS:000255592400041,18418377,No,,,11/20/17

At mucosal surfaces, T(H)17 cells are thought to protect the host from infection, whereas regulatory T ( T-reg) cells control immune responses and inflammation triggered by the resident microflora(1-5). Differentiation of both cell types requires transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta), but depends on distinct transcription factors: ROR gamma t ( encoded by Rorc(gamma t)) for T(H)17 cells and Foxp3 for T-reg cells(6-8). How TGF-beta regulates the differentiation of T cells with opposing activities has been perplexing. Here we demonstrate that, together with pro- inflammatory cytokines, TGF-beta orchestrates T(H)17 cell differentiation in a concentration-dependent manner. At low concentrations, TGF-b synergizes with interleukin ( IL)- 6 and IL- 21 ( refs 9 - 11) to promote IL- 23 receptor (Il23r) expression, favouring T(H)17 cell differentiation. High concentrations of TGF-beta repress IL23r expression and favour Foxp3(+) T-reg cells. ROR gamma t and Foxp3 are co- expressed in naive CD4(+) T cells exposed to TGF-beta and in a subset of T cells in the small intestinal lamina propria of the mouse. In vitro, TGF-beta-induced Foxp3 inhibits ROR gamma t function, at least in part through their interaction. Accordingly, lamina propria T cells that co-express both transcription factors produce less IL- 17 ( also known as IL-17a) than those that express ROR gamma t alone. IL- 6, IL- 21 and IL- 23 relieve Foxp3- mediated inhibition of ROR gamma t, thereby promoting TH17 cell differentiation. Therefore, the decision of antigen- stimulated cells to differentiate into either T(H)17 or T-reg cells depends on the cytokine- regulated balance of ROR gamma t and Foxp3.","[Zhou, Liang; Chong, Mark M.

Rab5 is known as a key regulator of the early endocytic pathway(3) and we have recently shown that Rab5 is also implicated in apoptotic cell engulfment(4); however, the precise spatio- temporal dynamics of Rab5 activity remain unknown. Here, using a newly developed fluorescence resonance energy transfer biosensor, we describe a change in Rab5 activity during the engulfment of apoptotic thymocytes. Rab5 activity on phagosome membranes began to increase on disassembly of the actin coat encapsulating phagosomes. Rab5 activation was either continuous or repetitive for up to 10 min, but it ended before the collapse of engulfed apoptotic cells. Expression of a dominant-negative mutant of Rab5 delayed this collapse of apoptotic thymocytes, showing a role for Rab5 in phagosome maturation. Disruption of microtubules with nocodazole inhibited Rab5 activation on the phagosome membrane without perturbing the engulfment of apoptotic cells. Furthermore, we found that Gapex-5 is the guanine nucleotide exchange factor essential for Rab5 activation during the engulfment of apoptotic cells. Gapex- 5 was bound to a microtubule- tip- associating protein, EB1, whose depletion inhibited Rab5 activation during phagocytosis. We therefore propose a mechanistic model in which the recruitment of Gapex- 5 to phagosomes through the microtubule network induces the transient Rab5 activation.","[Kitano, Masahiro; Nakamura, Takeshi; Matsuda, Michiyuki] Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Biostudies, Lab Bioimaging & Cell Signaling, Sakyo Ku, Kyoto 6068501, Japan; [Nakaya, Michio; Nagata, Shigekazu] Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Med, Dept Med Chem, Sakyo Ku, Kyoto 6068501, Japan; [Kitano, Masahiro] Osaka Univ, Microbial Dis Res Inst, Dept Signal Transduct, Suita, Osaka 5650871, Japan; [Nakaya, Michio; Nagata, Shigekazu] Japan Sci & Technol Corp, Solut Oriented Res Sci & Technol, Sakyo Ku, Kyoto 6068501, Japan","Nakamura, T (reprint author), Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Biostudies, Lab Bioimaging & Cell Signaling, Sakyo Ku, Yoshida Konoe Cho, Kyoto 6068501, Japan.",tnakamr@path1.med.kyoto-u.ac.jp,,,,,,24,82,85,0,11,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,8-May,2008,453,7192,,,,,241,U15,,10.1038/nature06857,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,297BP,WOS:000255592400044,18385674,No,,,11/20/17

Large- scale characterization of nucleosome positioning in Saccharomyces cerevisiae has revealed a stereotyped promoter organization in which a nucleosome- free region ( NFR) is present within several hundred base pairs upstream of the translation start site(4,5). Many transcription factors bind within NFRs and nucleate chromatin remodelling events which then expose other cis- regulatory elements(6-9). However, it is not clear how transcription- factor binding and chromatin influence quantitative attributes of gene expression. Here we show that nucleosomes function largely to decouple the threshold of induction from dynamic range. With a series of variants of one promoter, we establish that the affinity of exposed binding sites is a primary determinant of the level of physiological stimulus necessary for substantial gene activation, and sites located within nucleosomal regions serve to scale expression once chromatin is remodelled. Furthermore, we find that the S. cerevisiae phosphate response ( PHO) pathway exploits these promoter designs to tailor gene expression to different environmental phosphate levels. Our results suggest that the interplay of chromatin and binding- site affinity provides a mechanism for fine-tuning responses to the same cellular state. Moreover, these findings may be a starting point for more detailed models of eukaryotic transcriptional control.","[Lam, Felix H.; Steger, David J.; O'Shea, Erin K.] Harvard Univ, Fac Arts & Sci, Ctr Syst Biol, Dept Mol & Cellular Biol,Howard Hughes Med Inst, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Lam, Felix H.; Steger, David J.; O'Shea, Erin K.] Harvard Univ, Fac Arts & Sci, Ctr Syst Biol, Dept Chem & Chem Biol,Howard Hughes Med Inst, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Lam, Felix H.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Grad Grp Biophys, San Francisco, CA 94158 USA","O'Shea, EK (reprint author), Harvard Univ, Fac Arts & Sci, Ctr Syst Biol, Dept Mol & Cellular Biol,Howard Hughes Med Inst, 7 Divin Ave,Bauer 307, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",erin_oshea@harvard.edu,,,"Howard Hughes Medical Institute; NIGMS NIH HHS [R01 GM051377, R01 GM051377-15]",,,34,168,169,0,6,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,8-May,2008,453,7192,,,,,246,U16,,10.1038/nature06867,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,297BP,WOS:000255592400045,18418379,No,,,11/20/17

In agreement with this principle, rapidly migrating leukocytes use integrin- mediated adhesion when moving over two- dimensional surfaces. As migration on two- dimensional substrates naturally overemphasizes the role of adhesion, the contribution of integrins during three- dimensional movement of leukocytes within tissues has remained controversial. We studied the interplay between adhesive, contractile and protrusive forces during interstitial leukocyte chemotaxis in vivo and in vitro. We ablated all integrin heterodimers from murine leukocytes, and show here that functional integrins do not contribute to migration in three- dimensional environments. Instead, these cells migrate by the sole force of actin- network expansion, which promotes protrusive flowing of the leading edge. Myosin II- dependent contraction is only required on passage through narrow gaps, where a squeezing contraction of the trailing edge propels the rigid nucleus.","[Laemmermann, Tim; Hirsch, Karin; Faessler, Reinhard; Sixt, Michael] Max Planck Inst Biochem, Dept Mol Med, D-82152 Martinsried, Germany; [Wedlich-Soeldner, Roland] Max Planck Inst Biochem, Jr Res Grp Cellular Dynam & Cell Patterning, D-82152 Martinsried, Germany; [Bader, Bernhard L.; Keller, Markus] Tech Univ Munich, Dept Med Nutr, D-85350 Freising Weihenstephan, Germany; [Monkley, Susan J.; Critchley, David R.] Univ Leicester, Dept Biochem, Leicester LE1 9HN, Leics, England; [Worbs, Tim; Foerster, Reinhold] Hannover Med Sch, Inst Immunol, D-30625 Hannover, Germany","Sixt, M (reprint author), Max Planck Inst Biochem, Dept Mol Med, D-82152 Martinsried, Germany.",sixt@biochem.mpg.de,"Keller, Markus/A-2823-2009; Sixt, Michael/F-3925-2010; Forster, Reinhold/D-6770-2011","Worbs, Tim/0000-0001-9945-3103; Sixt, Michael/0000-0002-6620-9179",Wellcome Trust,,,45,622,625,7,70,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,1-May,2008,453,7191,,,,,51,+,,10.1038/nature06887,,7,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,294ID,WOS:000255398800037,18451854,No,Y,N,11/20/17

Here we report the identification of the ligand- activated transcription factor aryl hydrocarbon receptor ( AHR) as a regulator of T-reg and T(H)17 cell differentiation in mice. AHR activation by its ligand 2,3,7,8- tetrachlorodibenzo- p- dioxin induced functional Treg cells that suppressed experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. On the other hand, AHR activation by 6- formylindolo[ 3,2- b] carbazole interfered with T-reg cell development, boosted T(H)17 cell differentiation and increased the severity of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis in mice. Thus, AHR regulates both T-reg and T(H)17 cell differentiation in a ligand- specific fashion, constituting a unique target for therapeutic immunomodulation.","[Quintana, Francisco J.; Basso, Alexandre S.; Iglesias, Antonio H.; Korn, Thomas; Farez, Mauricio F.; Bettelli, Estelle; Weiner, Howard L.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Brigham & Womens Hosp, Ctr Neurol Dis, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Caccamo, Mario] European Bioinformat Inst, EMBL Outstn Hinxton, Cambridge CB10 1SD, England; [Oukka, Mohamed] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Brigham & Womens Hosp, Ctr Neurol Dis, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA","Weiner, HL (reprint author), Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Brigham & Womens Hosp, Ctr Neurol Dis, 77 Ave Louis Pasteur, Boston, MA 02115 USA.",hweiner@rics.bwh.harvard.edu,"Basso, Alexandre/K-2281-2012","Korn, Thomas/0000-0002-3633-0955","NIAID NIH HHS [AI435801, R01 AI073542, R01 AI073542-01, R01 AI073542-02, R01AI073542-01]; NINDS NIH HHS [NS38037, P01 NS038037, R01 NS059996]",,,41,738,779,6,70,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,1-May,2008,453,7191,,,,,65,+,,10.1038/nature06880,,8,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,294ID,WOS:000255398800039,18362915,No,Y,N,11/20/17

We present detailed modelling that shows that the passage of ring particles through Jupiter's shadow creates the Thebe extension and fully accounts for these Galileo results.

Technological interest has been largely motivated by applications involving nanoscale superconducting circuit elements, such as standards based on quantum phase- slip junctions(3). Although phase slips caused by thermal fluctuations at high temperatures are well understood(4), controversy remains over the role of phase slips in small- scale superconductors(5) - in solids, problems such as uncontrolled noise sources and disorder complicate their study and application(6). Here we show that phase slips can lead to dissipation in a clean and well- characterized Bose - Hubbard system, by experimentally studying the transport of ultracold atoms trapped in an optical lattice. In contrast to previous work, we explore a low- velocity regime described by the three- dimensional Bose Hubbard model that is unaffected by instabilities, and we measure the effect of temperature on the dissipation strength. The damping rate of atomic motion ( the analogue of electrical resistance in a solid) in the confining parabolic potential is well fitted by a model that includes finite damping at zero temperature. The low- temperature behaviour is consistent with the theory of quantum tunnelling of phase slips, whereas at higher temperatures a crossover consistent with a transition to thermal activation of phase slips is evident. Motion- induced features reminiscent of vortices and vortex rings associated with phase slips are also observed in time- of- flight imaging. These results clarify the role of phase slips in superfluid systems. They may also be of relevance in understanding the source of metallic phases observed in thin films(7,8), or serve as a test bed for theories of bosonic dissipation based upon variants of the Bose - Hubbard model(9).","[McKay, D.; White, M.; Pasienski, M.; DeMarco, B.] Univ Illinois, Dept Phys, Urbana, IL 61801 USA","DeMarco, B (reprint author), Univ Illinois, Dept Phys, 1110 W Green St, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.",bdemarco@uiuc.edu,,"DeMarco, Brian/0000-0002-2791-0413",,,,35,58,58,1,10,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,1-May,2008,453,7191,,,,,76,+,,10.1038/nature06920,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,294ID,WOS:000255398800041,18451857,No,,,11/20/17

However, in 1971 Leon Chua reasoned from symmetry arguments that there should be a fourth fundamental element, which he called a memristor ( short for memory resistor)(1). Although he showed that such an element has many interesting and valuable circuit properties, until now no one has presented either a useful physical model or an example of a memristor. Here we show, using a simple analytical example, that memristance arises naturally in nanoscale systems in which solid- state electronic and ionic transport are coupled under an external bias voltage.

Prominent examples include hurricane activity in the Atlantic(1), and surface- temperature and rainfall variations over North America(2), Europe(3) and northern Africa(4). Although these multidecadal variations are potentially predictable if the current state of the ocean is known(5-7), the lack of subsurface ocean observations(8) that constrain this state has been a limiting factor for realizing the full skill potential of such predictions(9). Here we apply a simple approach - that uses only sea surface temperature ( SST) observations - to partly overcome this difficulty and perform retrospective decadal predictions with a climate model. Skill is improved significantly relative to predictions made with incomplete knowledge of the ocean state(10), particularly in the North Atlantic and tropical Pacific oceans. Thus these results point towards the possibility of routine decadal climate predictions. Using this method, and by considering both internal natural climate variations and projected future anthropogenic forcing, we make the following forecast: over the next decade, the current Atlantic meridional overturning circulation will weaken to its long- term mean; moreover, North Atlantic SST and European and North American surface temperatures will cool slightly, whereas tropical Pacific SST will remain almost unchanged. Our results suggest that global surface temperature may not increase over the next decade, as natural climate variations in the North Atlantic and tropical Pacific temporarily offset the projected anthropogenic warming.","[Keenlyside, N.

Its spreading created the Eurasian basin, which is isolated from the rest of the oceanic mantle by North America, Eurasia and the Lomonosov ridge. The Gakkel ridge thus provides unique opportunities to investigate the composition of the sub- Arctic mantle and mantle heterogeneity and melting at the lower limits of seafloor spreading. The first results of the 2001 Arctic Mid- Ocean Ridge Expedition ( ref. 1) divided the Gakkel ridge into three tectonic segments, composed of robust western and eastern volcanic zones separated by a `sparsely magmatic zone'. On the basis of Sr - Nd - Pb isotope ratios and trace elements in basalts from the spreading axis, we show that the sparsely magmatic zone contains an abrupt mantle compositional boundary. Basalts to the west of the boundary display affinities to the Southern Hemisphere 'Dupal' isotopic province(2), whereas those to the east - closest to the Eurasian continent and where the spreading rate is slowest display affinities to 'Northern Hemisphere' ridges. The western zone is the only known spreading ridge outside the Southern Hemisphere that samples a significant upper- mantle region with Dupal- like characteristics. Although the cause of Dupal mantle has been long debated, we show that the source of this signature beneath the western Gakkel ridge was subcontinental lithospheric mantle that delaminated and became integrated into the convecting Arctic asthenosphere. This occurred as North Atlantic mantle propagated north into the Arctic during the separation of Svalbard and Greenland.","[Goldstein, Steven L.; Soffer, Gad; Lehnert, Kerstin A.] Columbia Univ, Lamont Doherty Earth Observ, Palisades, NY 10964 USA; [Goldstein, Steven L.; Soffer, Gad] Columbia Univ, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, Palisades, NY 10964 USA; [Langmuir, Charles H.] Harvard Univ, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Graham, David W.] Oregon State Univ, Coll Ocean & Atmospher Sci, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA; [Michael, Peter J.] Univ Tulsa, Dept Geosci, Tulsa, OK 74104 USA","Goldstein, SL (reprint author), Columbia Univ, Lamont Doherty Earth Observ, 61 Route 9W, Palisades, NY 10964 USA.",steveg@ldeo.columbia.edu,"Wright, Dawn/A-4518-2011","Wright, Dawn/0000-0002-2997-7611; Lehnert, Kerstin/0000-0001-7036-1977; Graham, David/0000-0002-7411-1905",,,,34,57,60,0,22,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,1-May,2008,453,7191,,,,,89,+,,10.1038/nature06919,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,294ID,WOS:000255398800044,18451860,No,,,11/20/17

Because of its critical phylogenetic position, members of the Hydatellaceae have the potential to provide insights into the origin and early diversification of angiosperms(2). Here I report that Hydatella expresses several rare embryological features that, in combination, are found only in members of the Nymphaeales. At maturity, the female gametophyte is four- celled, four- nucleate and will produce a diploid endosperm, as is characteristic of most early divergent angiosperm lineages(3,4). As with all members of the Nymphaeales, endosperm in Hydatella is minimally developed and perisperm is the major embryo- nourishing tissue within the seed(5,6). Remarkably, Hydatella exhibits a maternal seed-provisioning strategy that is unique among flowering plants, but common to all gymnosperms(7): pre- fertilization allocation of nutrients to the embryo- nourishing tissue. This exceptional case of pre- fertilization maternal provisioning of a seed in Hydatella may well be an apomorphic feature of Hydatellaceae alone but, given the newly discovered phylogenetic position of this family, potentially represents a plesiomorphic and transitional condition associated with the origin of flowering plants from gymnospermous ancestors.","Univ Colorado, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Boulder, CO 80309 USA","Friedman, WE (reprint author), Univ Colorado, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Boulder, CO 80309 USA.",ned@colorado.edu,,"Friedman, William/0000-0003-0374-3427",,,,30,42,43,1,29,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,1-May,2008,453,7191,,,,,94,97,,10.1038/nature06733,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,294ID,WOS:000255398800045,18354395,No,,,11/20/17

Recent studies suggest that networks often exhibit hierarchical organization, in which vertices divide into groups that further subdivide into groups of groups, and so forth over multiple scales. In many cases the groups are found to correspond to known functional units, such as ecological niches in food webs, modules in biochemical networks ( protein interaction networks, metabolic networks or genetic regulatory networks) or communities in social networks(4-7). Here we present a general technique for inferring hierarchical structure from network data and show that the existence of hierarchy can simultaneously explain and quantitatively reproduce many commonly observed topological properties of networks, such as right- skewed degree distributions, high clustering coefficients and short path lengths. We further show that knowledge of hierarchical structure can be used to predict missing connections in partly known networks with high accuracy, and for more general network structures than competing techniques(8). Taken together, our results suggest that hierarchy is a central organizing principle of complex networks, capable of offering insight into many network phenomena.","[Clauset, Aaron; Moore, Cristopher] Univ New Mexico, Dept Comp Sci, Albuquerque, NM 87131 USA; [Moore, Cristopher] Univ New Mexico, Dept Phys & Astron, Albuquerque, NM 87131 USA; [Clauset, Aaron; Moore, Cristopher; Newman, M.

These retinal outputs support not only pattern vision but also non- image- forming ( NIF) functions, which include circadian photoentrainment and pupillary light reflex ( PLR). In mammals, NIF functions are mediated by rods, cones and the melanopsin- containing intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs)(2,3). Rod - cone photoreceptors and ipRGCs are complementary in signalling light intensity for NIF functions(4-12). The ipRGCs, in addition to being directly photosensitive, also receive synaptic input from rod - cone networks(13,14). To determine how the ipRGCs relay rod - cone light information for both image- forming and non- image- forming functions, we genetically ablated ipRGCs in mice. Here we show that animals lacking ipRGCs retain pattern vision but have deficits in both PLR and circadian photoentrainment that are more extensive than those observed in melanopsin knockouts(8,10,11). The defects in PLR and photoentrainment resemble those observed in animals that lack phototransduction in all three photoreceptor classes(6). These results indicate that light signals for irradiance detection are dissociated from pattern vision at the retinal ganglion cell level, and animals that cannot detect light for NIF functions are still capable of image formation.","[Gueler, Ali D.; Ecker, Jennifer L.; Altimus, Cara M.; Zhao, Haiqing; Hattar, Samer] Johns Hopkins Univ, Dept Biol, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA; [Lall, Gurprit S.; Barnard, Alun R.; Lucas, Robert J.] Univ Manchester, Fac Life Sci, Manchester M13 9PT, Lancs, England; [Haq, Shafiqul; Liao, Hsi-Wen; Cahill, Hugh; Yau, King-Wai] Johns Hopkins Univ, Sch Med, Dept Neurosci, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA; [Hankins, Mark W.] Univ Oxford, Oxford OX3 7BN, England; [Berson, David M.] Brown Univ, Dept Neurosci, Providence, RI 02912 USA","Hattar, S (reprint author), Johns Hopkins Univ, Dept Biol, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA.",robert.lucas@manchester.ac.uk; shattar@jhu.edu,,"Badea, Tudor Constantin/0000-0003-3086-6713; Lall, Gurprit/0000-0003-3725-4795","NEI NIH HHS [R01 EY006837, R01 EY006837-16A1, R01 EY006837-18, R01 EY006837-20A1, R01 EY006837-21, R01 EY014596, R01 EY014596-01, R01 EY014596-02, R01 EY014596-03, R01 EY014596-04, R01 EY014596-05, R01 EY014596-06, R01 EY017137]; NIDCD NIH HHS [R01 DC006904-04, R01 DC006904, R01 DC006904-01, R01 DC006904-02, R01 DC006904-03]; NIGMS NIH HHS [R01 GM076430, R01 GM076430-01, R01 GM076430-02, R01 GM076430-03, R01 GM076430-04, R01 GM076430-05]",,,26,345,354,7,52,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,1-May,2008,453,7191,,,,,102,+,,10.1038/nature06829,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,294ID,WOS:000255398800047,18432195,No,Y,N,11/20/17

Environmental factors are believed to contribute to the increased prevalence of autoimmune diseases, many of which are due to the activity of T(H)17 T cells, a new helper T- cell subset characterized by the production of the cytokine IL- 17. Here we show that in the CD4(+) T- cell lineage of mice AHR expression is restricted to the T(H)17 cell subset and its ligation results in the production of the T(H)17 cytokine interleukin ( IL)- 22. AHR is also expressed in human T(H)17 cells. Activation of AHR by a high-affinity ligand during T(H)17 cell development markedly increases the proportion of T(H)17 T cells and their production of cytokines. CD4(+) T cells from AHR- deficient mice can develop T(H)17 cell responses, but when confronted with AHR ligand fail to produce IL- 22 and do not show enhanced T(H)17 cell development.

To define oncogenic lesions that cooperate with BCR ABL1 to induce ALL, we performed a genome- wide analysis of diagnostic leukaemia samples from 304 individuals with ALL, including 43 BCR - ABL1 B- progenitor ALLs and 23 CML cases. IKZF1 ( encoding the transcription factor Ikaros) was deleted in 83.7% of BCR - ABL1 ALL, but not in chronic- phase CML. Deletion of IKZF1 was also identified as an acquired lesion at the time of transformation of CML to ALL ( lymphoid blast crisis). The IKZF1 deletions resulted in haploin sufficiency, expression of a dominant- negative Ikaros isoform, or the complete loss of Ikaros expression. Sequencing of IKZF1 deletion breakpoints suggested that aberrant RAG- mediated recombination is responsible for the deletions. These findings suggest that genetic lesions resulting in the loss of Ikaros function are an important event in the development of BCR - ABL1 ALL.","[Mullighan, Charles G.; Miller, Christopher B.; Radtke, Ina; Phillips, Letha A.; Dalton, James; Shurtleff, Sheila A.; Downing, James R.] St Jude Childrens Hosp, Dept Pathol, Memphis, TN 38105 USA; [Pui, Ching-Hon] St Jude Childrens Hosp, Dept Oncol, Memphis, TN 38105 USA; [Relling, Mary V.] St Jude Childrens Hosp, Dept Pharmaceut Sci, Memphis, TN 38105 USA; [Ma, Jing] St Jude Childrens Hosp, Hartwell Ctr Bioinformat & Biotechnol, Memphis, TN 38105 USA; [White, Deborah; Hughes, Timothy P.] Inst Med & Vet Sci, Div Haematol, Adelaide, SA 5000, Australia; [Le Beau, Michelle M.] Univ Chicago, Hematol Oncol Sect, Chicago, IL 60637 USA","Downing, JR (reprint author), St Jude Childrens Hosp, Dept Pathol, 332 N Lauderdale St, Memphis, TN 38105 USA.",james.downing@stjude.org,,"White, Deborah/0000-0003-4844-333X; Mullighan, Charles/0000-0002-1871-1850",,,,32,553,575,2,19,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,1-May,2008,453,7191,,,,,110,+,,10.1038/nature06866,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,294ID,WOS:000255398800049,18408710,No,Y,N,11/20/17

Localized RNAs are usually transported along microtubules or actin filaments(1) and become anchored at their destination to some underlying subcellular structure. Retention commonly involves actin or actin- associated proteins(2-7), although cytokeratin filaments and dynein anchor certain RNAs(8,9). RNA localization is important for diverse processes ranging from cell fate determination to synaptic plasticity; however, so far there have been few comprehensive studies of localized RNAs in mammalian cells. Here we have addressed this issue, focusing on migrating fibroblasts that polarize to form a leading edge and a tail in a process that involves asymmetric distribution of RNAs(10-12). We used a fractionation scheme(13) combined with microarrays to identify, on a genome- wide scale, RNAs that localize in protruding pseudopodia of mouse fibroblasts in response to migratory stimuli. We find that a diverse group of RNAs accumulates in such pseudopodial protrusions. Through their 39 untranslated regions these transcripts are anchored in granules concentrated at the plus ends of detyrosinated microtubules. RNAs in the granules associate with the adenomatous polyposis coli ( APC) tumour suppressor and the fragile X mental retardation protein ( FMRP). APC is required for the accumulation of transcripts in protrusions. Our results suggest a new type of RNA anchoring mechanism as well as a new, unanticipated function for APC in localizing RNAs.","[Mili, Stavroula; Macara, Ian G.] Univ Virginia, Hlth Sci Ctr, Dept Microbiol, Ctr Cell Signaling, Charlottesville, VA 22908 USA; [Moissoglu, Konstadinos] Univ Virginia, Hlth Sci Ctr, Cardiovasc Res Ctr, Charlottesville, VA 22908 USA","Macara, IG (reprint author), Univ Virginia, Hlth Sci Ctr, Dept Microbiol, Ctr Cell Signaling, Charlottesville, VA 22908 USA.",sm2ju@virginia.edu; igm9c@virginia.edu,,"Mili, Stavroula/0000-0002-9161-8660","NIGMS NIH HHS [R01 GM070902, R01 GM070902-05]",,,30,126,127,0,15,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,1-May,2008,453,7191,,,,,115,+,,10.1038/nature06888,,7,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,294ID,WOS:000255398800050,18451862,No,,,11/20/17

Neither extensive computational analysis of the genome nor biochemical tests in cell extracts revealed the existence of this enzyme. Here we show that the conserved placement of its tRNA gene promoters allows the synthesis of leaderless tRNAs, whose presence was verified by the observation of 5' triphosphorylated mature tRNA species. Initiation of tRNA gene transcription requires a purine, which coincides with the finding that tRNAs with a cytosine in position 1 display unusually extended 5' termini with an extra purine residue. These tRNAs were shown to be substrates for their cognate aminoacyl- tRNA synthetases.

The T3SS system is characterized by a series of prominent multicomponent rings in the inner and outer bacterial membranes, as well as a translocation pore in the host cell membrane. These are all connected by a series of polymerized tubes that act as the direct conduit for the T3SS proteins to pass through to the host cell. During assembly of the T3SS, as well as the evolutionarily related flagellar apparatus(2), a post- translational cleavage event within the inner membrane proteins EscU/FlhB is required to promote a secretion- competent state. These proteins have long been proposed to act as a part of a molecular switch, which would regulate the appropriate chronological secretion of the various T3SS apparatus components during assembly and subsequently the transported virulence effectors. Here we show that a surface type II beta- turn in the Escherichia coli protein EscU undergoes auto-cleavage by a mechanism involving cyclization of a strictly conserved asparagine residue(3). Structural and in vivo analysis of point and deletion mutations illustrates the subtle conformational effects of auto- cleavage in modulating the molecular features of a highly conserved surface region of EscU, a potential point of interaction with other T3SS components at the inner membrane. In addition, this work provides new structural insight into the distinct conformational requirements for a large class of self-cleaving reactions involving asparagine cyclization.","[Zarivach, Raz; Vuckovic, Marija; Strynadka, Natalie C.

Crosstalk between glomeruli has been proposed to be important in olfactory processing, but it is not clear how these interactions shape the odour responses of second- order neurons. In the Drosophila antennal lobe ( a region analogous to the vertebrate olfactory bulb), we selectively removed most interglomerular input to genetically identified second- order olfactory neurons. Here we show that this broadens the odour tuning of these neurons, implying that interglomerular inhibition dominates over interglomerular excitation. The strength of this inhibitory signal scales with total feedforward input to the entire antennal lobe, and has similar tuning in different glomeruli. A substantial portion of this interglomerular inhibition acts at a presynaptic locus, and our results imply that this is mediated by both ionotropic and metabotropic receptors on the same nerve terminal.","[Olsen, Shawn R.; Wilson, Rachel I.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Neurobiol, Boston, MA 02115 USA","Wilson, RI (reprint author), Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Neurobiol, 220 Longwood Ave, Boston, MA 02115 USA.",rachel_wilson@hms.harvard.edu,"Wilson, Rachel/E-2227-2012; Marion-Poll, Frederic/D-8882-2011","Marion-Poll, Frederic/0000-0001-6824-0180","NIDCD NIH HHS [R01 DC008174-03, R01 DC008174]",,,42,233,235,0,23,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,24-Apr,2008,452,7190,,,,,956,U3,,10.1038/nature06864,,7,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,291PF,WOS:000255208600031,18344978,No,,,11/20/17

ABH2 has the primary role of guarding mammalian genomes against 1- meA damage by repairing this lesion in double- stranded DNA ( dsDNA), whereas AlkB and ABH3 preferentially repair single- stranded DNA ( ssDNA) lesions and can repair damaged bases in RNA. Here we show the first crystal structures of AlkB - dsDNA and ABH2 - dsDNA complexes, stabilized by a chemical cross- linking strategy. This study reveals that AlkB uses an unprecedented base- flipping mechanism to access the damaged base: it squeezes together the two bases flanking the flipped- out one to maintain the base stack, explaining the preference of AlkB for repairing ssDNA lesions over dsDNA ones. In addition, the first crystal structure of ABH2, presented here, provides a structural basis for designing inhibitors of this human DNA repair protein.","[Yang, Cai-Guang; Yi, Chengqi; Duguid, Erica M.; Sullivan, Christopher T.; Jian, Xing; He, Chuan] Univ Chicago, Dept Chem, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Rice, Phoebe A.] Univ Chicago, Dept Biochem & Mol Biol, Chicago, IL 60637 USA","He, C (reprint author), Univ Chicago, Dept Chem, 929 E 57th St, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.",chuanhe@uchicago.edu,,,"NIGMS NIH HHS [GM071440, R01 GM071440, R01 GM071440-03]",,,44,131,136,1,34,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,24-Apr,2008,452,7190,,,,,961,U4,,10.1038/nature06889,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,291PF,WOS:000255208600032,18432238,No,,,11/20/17

They possess oppositely directed plasma jets emanating at near light speeds from accreting supermassive black holes. According to theoretical models, such jets are propelled by magnetic fields twisted by differential rotation of the black hole's accretion disk or inertial-frame-dragging ergosphere(1-3). The flow velocity increases outward along the jet in an acceleration and collimation zone containing a coiled magnetic field(4,5). Detailed observations of outbursts of electromagnetic radiation, for which blazars are famous, can potentially probe the zone. It has hitherto not been possible to either specify the location of the outbursts or verify the general picture of jet formation. Here we report sequences of high- resolution radio images and optical polarization measurements of the blazar BL Lacertae. The data reveal a bright feature in the jet that causes a double flare of radiation from optical frequencies to TeV gamma-ray energies, as well as a delayed outburst at radio wavelengths. We conclude that the event starts in a region with a helical magnetic field that we identify with the acceleration and collimation zone predicted by the theories. The feature brightens again when it crosses a standing shock wave corresponding to the bright 'core' seen on the images.","[Marscher, Alan P.; Jorstad, Svetlana G.; D'Arcangelo, Francesca D.; Oh, Haruki; Olmstead, Alice R.] Boston Univ, Inst Astrophys Res, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Jorstad, Svetlana G.; Larionov, Valeri M.; Hagen-Thorn, Vladimir A.; Kopatskaya, Eugenia N.] St Petersburg State Univ, Astron Inst, St Petersburg 198504, Russia; [Smith, Paul S.] Univ Arizona, Steward Observ, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA; [Williams, G.

Z.",,,A topological Dirac insulator in a quantum spin Hall phase,NATURE,,,English,Article,,,,,,,MAGNETIC SUSCEPTIBILITY; BAND-STRUCTURE; GRAPHENE; BISMUTH; TRANSITION; WELLS; MODEL; GAS,"When electrons are subject to a large external magnetic field, the conventional charge quantum Hall effect(1,2) dictates that an electronic excitation gap is generated in the sample bulk, but metallic conduction is permitted at the boundary. Recent theoretical models suggest that certain bulk insulators with large spin - orbit interactions may also naturally support conducting topological boundary states in the quantum limit(3-5), which opens up the possibility for studying unusual quantum Hall- like phenomena in zero external magnetic fields(6). Bulk Bi1-xSbx single crystals are predicted to be prime candidates(7,8) for one such unusual Hall phase of matter known as the topological insulator(9-11). The hallmark of a topological insulator is the existence of metallic surface states that are higher- dimensional analogues of the edge states that characterize a quantum spin Hall insulator(3-13). In addition to its interesting boundary states, the bulk of Bi1-xSbx is predicted to exhibit three- dimensional Dirac particles(14-17), another topic of heightened current interest following the new findings in two-dimensional graphene(18-20) and charge quantum Hall fractionalization observed in pure bismuth(21). However, despite numerous transport and magnetic measurements on the Bi1-xSbx family since the 1960s(17), no direct evidence of either topological Hall states or bulk Dirac particles has been found. Here, using incident- photon- energy- modulated angle- resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( IPEM- ARPES), we report the direct observation of massive Dirac particles in the bulk of Bi0.9Sb0.1, locate the Kramers points at the sample's boundary and provide a comprehensive mapping of the Dirac insulator's gapless surface electron bands. These findings taken together suggest that the observed surface state on the boundary of the bulk insulator is a realization of the 'topological metal'(9-11). They also suggest that this material has potential application in developing next- generation quantum computing devices that may incorporate 'light- like' bulk carriers and spin- textured surface currents.","[Hsieh, D.; Qian, D.; Wray, L.; Xia, Y.; Hasan, M.

Angle- resolved photoemission spectroscopy experiments(1,2) have revealed a kink in the dispersion relations ( energy versus wavevector) of electronic states in the copper oxides at binding energies of 50-80 meV, raising the hope that this anomaly could be a key to understanding high- temperature superconductivity. The kink is often interpreted in terms of interactions between the electrons and a bosonic field. Although there is no consensus on the nature of the bosons ( or even whether a boson model is appropriate), both phonons(1) and spin fluctuations(2) have been proposed as possible candidates. Here we report first- principles calculations of the role of phonons and the electron - phonon interaction in the photoemission spectra of La2-xSrxCuO4. Our calculations within the standard formalism demonstrate that the phonon- induced renormalization of the electron energies and the Fermi velocity is almost one order of magnitude smaller than the effect observed in photoemission experiments. Therefore, our result rules out electron - phonon interaction in bulk La2-xSrxCuO4 as the exclusive origin of the measured kink. Our conclusions are consistent with those reached independently in a recent study(3) of the related compound YBa2Cu3O7.","[Giustino, Feliciano; Cohen, Marvin L.; Louie, Steven G.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Phys, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Giustino, Feliciano; Cohen, Marvin L.; Louie, Steven G.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Lawrence Berkeley Lab, Div Mat Sci, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA","Louie, SG (reprint author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Phys, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",sglouie@berkeley.edu,"Giustino, Feliciano/F-6343-2013","Giustino, Feliciano/0000-0001-9293-1176",,,,29,99,99,1,26,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,24-Apr,2008,452,7190,,,,,975,978,,10.1038/nature06874,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,291PF,WOS:000255208600035,18432241,No,,,11/20/17

This climate transition was accompanied(3) by a deepening of the calcite compensation depth - the ocean depth at which the rate of calcium carbonate input from surface waters equals the rate of dissolution. Changes in the global carbon cycle(4), rather than changes in continental configuration(5), have recently been proposed as the most likely root cause of Antarctic glaciation, but the mechanism linking glaciation to the deepening of calcite compensation depth remains unclear. Here we use a global biogeochemical box model to test competing hypotheses put forward to explain the Eocene/ Oligocene transition. We find that, of the candidate hypotheses, only shelf to deep sea carbonate partitioning is capable of explaining the observed changes in both carbon isotope composition and calcium carbonate accumulation at the sea floor. In our simulations, glacioeustatic sea- level fall associated with the growth of Antarctic ice sheets permanently reduces global calcium carbonate accumulation on the continental shelves, leading to an increase in pelagic burial via permanent deepening of the calcite compensation depth. At the same time, fresh limestones are exposed to erosion, thus temporarily increasing global river inputs of dissolved carbonate and increasing seawater delta(13) C. Our work sheds new light on the mechanisms linking glaciation and ocean acidity change across arguably the most important climate transition of the Cenozoic era.","[Merico, Agostino; Tyrrell, Toby; Wilson, Paul A.] Natl Oceanog Ctr, Southampton SO14 3ZH, Hants, England; [Merico, Agostino] GKSS Forschungszentrum Geesthacht GmbH, Inst Coastal Res, D-21502 Geesthacht, Germany","Merico, A (reprint author), Natl Oceanog Ctr, European Way, Southampton SO14 3ZH, Hants, England.",agostino.merico@gkss.de,"Merico, Agostino/C-1103-2013","Merico, Agostino/0000-0001-8095-8056",,,,39,55,58,3,28,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,24-Apr,2008,452,7190,,,,,979,U6,,10.1038/nature06853,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,291PF,WOS:000255208600036,18432242,No,,,11/20/17

At low pressure ( up to a few gigapascals) the solubility of water increases rapidly with increasing pressure(1), and water has a large influence on the solidus temperature, density(2), viscosity(3) and electrical conductivity. Here we report the results of first- principles molecular dynamics simulations of hydrous MgSiO(3) melt. These show that pressure has a profound influence on speciation of the water component, which changes from being dominated by hydroxyls and water molecules at low pressure(4) to extended structures at high pressure. We link this change in structure to our finding that the water - silicate system becomes increasingly ideal at high pressure: we find complete miscibility of water and silicate melt throughout almost the entire mantle pressure regime. On the basis of our results, we argue that a buoyantly stable melt at the base of the upper mantle would contain approximately 3 wt% water and have an electrical conductivity of 18 S m(-1), and should therefore be detectable by means of electromagnetic sounding.","[Stixrude, Lars] UCL, Dept Earth Sci, London WC1E 6BT, England; [Mookherjee, Mainak] Yale Univ, Dept Geol & Geophys, New Haven, CT 06511 USA; [Karki, Bijaya] Louisiana State Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA; [Karki, Bijaya] Louisiana State Univ, Dept Geol & Geophys, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA","Stixrude, L (reprint author), UCL, Dept Earth Sci, Gower St, London WC1E 6BT, England.",stixrude@umich.edu,"Mookherjee, Mainak/F-7949-2010; Stixrude, Lars/C-5625-2012","Mookherjee, Mainak/0000-0002-0605-5964; Stixrude, Lars/0000-0003-3778-2432",,,,30,63,67,5,43,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,24-Apr,2008,452,7190,,,,,983,986,,10.1038/nature06918,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,291PF,WOS:000255208600037,18432243,No,,,11/20/17

During outbreaks, the resulting widespread tree mortality reduces forest carbon uptake and increases future emissions from the decay of killed trees. The impacts of insects on forest carbon dynamics, however, are generally ignored in large- scale modelling analyses. The current outbreak in British Columbia, Canada, is an order of magnitude larger in area and severity than all previous recorded outbreaks(4). Here we estimate that the cumulative impact of the beetle outbreak in the affected region during 2000 - 2020 will be 270 megatonnes ( Mt) carbon ( or 36 g carbon m(-2) yr(-1) on average over 374,000 km 2 of forest). This impact converted the forest from a small net carbon sink to a large net carbon source both during and immediately after the outbreak. In the worst year, the impacts resulting from the beetle outbreak in British Columbia were equivalent to similar to 75% of the average annual direct forest fire emissions from all of Canada during 1959 - 1999. The resulting reduction in net primary production was of similar magnitude to increases observed during the 1980s and 1990s as a result of global change(5). Climate change has contributed to the unprecedented extent and severity of this outbreak(6). Insect outbreaks such as this represent an important mechanism by which climate change may undermine the ability of northern forests to take up and store atmospheric carbon, and such impacts should be accounted for in large- scale modelling analyses.","[Kurz, W.

Here we report a 33 draft genome sequence of 'SunUp' papaya, the first commercial virus- resistant transgenic fruit tree(1) to be sequenced. The papaya genome is three times the size of the Arabidopsis genome, but contains fewer genes, including significantly fewer disease- resistance gene analogues. Comparison of the five sequenced genomes suggests a minimal angiosperm gene set of 13,311. A lack of recent genome duplication, atypical of other angiosperm genomes sequenced so far(2-5), may account for the smaller papaya gene number in most functional groups. Nonetheless, striking amplifications in gene number within particular functional groups suggest roles in the evolution of tree- like habit, deposition and remobilization of starch reserves, attraction of seed dispersal agents, and adaptation to tropical daylengths. Transgenesis at three locations is closely associated with chloroplast insertions into the nuclear genome, and with topoisomerase I recognition sites. Papaya offers numerous advantages as a system for fruit- tree functional genomics, and this draft genome sequence provides the foundation for revealing the basis of Carica's distinguishing morpho- physiological, medicinal and nutritional properties.","[Hou, Shaobin; Dionne-Laporte, Alexandre; Saw, Jimmy H.; Senin, Pavel; Ly, Benjamin V.; Lewis, Kanako L.

Neuropeptide Y ( NPY) is anxiolytic(1,2) and its release is induced by stress(3). NPY is abundantly expressed in regions of the limbic system that are implicated in arousal and in the assignment of emotional valences to stimuli and memories(4-6). Here we show that haplotype- driven NPY expression predicts brain responses to emotional and stress challenges and also inversely correlates with trait anxiety. NPY haplotypes predicted levels of NPY messenger RNA in postmortem brain and lymphoblasts, and levels of plasma NPY. Lower haplotype- driven NPY expression predicted higher emotion- induced activation of the amygdala, as well as diminished resiliency as assessed by pain/ stress- induced activations of endogenous opioid neurotransmission in various brain regions. A single nucleotide polymorphism ( SNP rs16147) located in the promoter region alters NPY expression in vitro and seems to account for more than half of the variation in expression in vivo. These convergent findings are consistent with the function of NPY as an anxiolytic peptide and help to explain inter- individual variation in resiliency to stress, a risk factor for many diseases.","[Zhou, Zhifeng; Zhu, Guanshan; Enoch, Mary-Anne; Lipsky, Robert H.; Hu, Xian-Zhang; Hodgkinson, Colin A.; Xu, Ke; Buzas, Beata; Yuan, Qiaoping; Shen, Pei-Hong; Goldman, David] NIAAA, Neurogenet Lab, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Hariri, Ahmad R.; Ferrell, Robert E.; Manuck, Stephen B.; Brown, Sarah M.] Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Psychiat, Pittsburgh, PA 15261 USA; [Hariri, Ahmad R.; Ferrell, Robert E.; Manuck, Stephen B.; Brown, Sarah M.] Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Human Genet, Pittsburgh, PA 15261 USA; [Hariri, Ahmad R.; Ferrell, Robert E.; Manuck, Stephen B.; Brown, Sarah M.] Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Psychol, Pittsburgh, PA 15261 USA; [Scott, David; Zubieta, Jon-Kar] Univ Michigan, Sch Med, Dept Psychiat, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Scott, David; Zubieta, Jon-Kar] Univ Michigan, Sch Med, Dept Radiol, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Sinha, Rajita] Yale Univ, Sch Med, Dept Psychiat, New Haven, CT 06510 USA; [Virkkunen, Matti] Univ Helsinki, Dept Psychiat, Helsinki 00014, Finland; [Mash, Deborah C.] Univ Miami, Sch Med, Dept Neurol, Miami, FL 33124 USA; [Hauger, Richard L.] San Diego VA Healthcare Syst, Dept Psychiat, San Diego, CA 92161 USA; [Hauger, Richard L.] Univ Calif San Diego, San Diego, CA 92161 USA; [Stohler, Christian S.] Univ Maryland, Sch Dent, Baltimore, MD 21201 USA","Goldman, D (reprint author), NIAAA, Neurogenet Lab, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA.",davidgoldman@mail.nih.gov,"Hariri, Ahmad/D-5761-2011; Goldman, David/F-9772-2010","Goldman, David/0000-0002-1724-5405; Lipsky, Robert/0000-0001-7753-1473","Intramural NIH HHS [Z01 AA000301-09, Z99 AA999999]; NHLBI NIH HHS [R01 HL065137, P01 HL040962]; NIAAA NIH HHS [R01 AA013892, R01-AA13892]; NIDA NIH HHS [K02 DA017232, K02-DA17232, P50 DA016556, P50-DA16556, PL1 DA024859, PL1 DA024859-02, R01 DA 016423, R01 DA016423]; NIDCR NIH HHS [R01 DE 15396, R01 DE015396]; NIMH NIH HHS [K01 MH072837, R01 MH074697, R01 MH074697-04A1]",,,35,238,245,0,20,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,24-Apr,2008,452,7190,,,,,997,U8,,10.1038/nature06858,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,291PF,WOS:000255208600040,18385673,No,,,11/20/17

The functional insect OR consists of a heteromeric complex of unknown stoichiometry but comprising at least one variable odorant- binding subunit and one constant Or83b family subunit(10-16). Insect ORs lack homology to G- protein-coupled chemosensory receptors in vertebrates(17) and possess a distinct seven- transmembrane topology with the amino terminus located intracellularly(10,18). Here we provide evidence that heteromeric insect ORs comprise a new class of ligand- activated nonselective cation channels. Heterologous cells expressing silkmoth, fruitfly or mosquito heteromeric OR complexes showed extracellular Ca2+ influx and cation- non- selective ion conductance on stimulation with odorant. Odour- evoked OR currents are independent of known G- protein- coupled second messenger pathways. The fast response kinetics and OR- subunit- dependent K+ ion selectivity of the insect OR complex support the hypothesis that the complex between OR and Or83b itself confers channel activity. Direct evidence for odorant- gated channels was obtained by outside- out patch- clamp recording of Xenopus oocyte and HEK293T cell membranes expressing insect OR complexes.

They couple to heterotrimeric G- proteins, most of which induce cAMP production(3). This second messenger then activates cyclic- nucleotide-gated ion channels to depolarize the olfactory receptor neuron, thus providing a signal for further neuronal processing. Recent findings, however, have challenged this concept of odorant signal transduction in insects, because their odorant receptors, which lack any sequence similarity to other GPCRs(4), are composed of conventional odorant receptors ( for example, Or22a), dimerized with a ubiquitously expressed chaperone protein(5), such as Or83b in Drosophila(6). Or83b has a structure akin to GPCRs, but has an inverted orientation in the plasma membrane(4,7). However, G proteins are expressed in insect olfactory receptor neurons(8), and olfactory perception is modified by mutations affecting the cAMP transduction pathway(9). Here we show that application of odorants to mammalian cells co- expressing Or22a and Or83b results in non- selective cation currents activated by means of an ionotropic and a metabotropic pathway, and a subsequent increase in the intracellular Ca2+ concentration. Expression of Or83b alone leads to functional ion channels not directly responding to odorants, but being directly activated by intracellular cAMP or cGMP. Insect odorant receptors thus form ligand- gated channels as well as complexes of odorant- sensing units and cyclic- nucleotide- activated non- selective cation channels. Thereby, they provide rapid and transient as well as sensitive and prolonged odorant signalling.","[Wicher, Dieter; Schaefer, Ronny; Bauernfeind, Rene; Stensmyr, Marcus C.; Hansson, Bill S.] Max Planck Inst Chem Ecol, Dept Evolutionary Neuroethol, D-07745 Jena, Germany; [Heller, Regine] Univ Jena, Inst Mol Cell Biol, Ctr Mol Biomed, D-07743 Jena, Germany; [Heinemann, Stefan H.] Univ Jena, Dept Biophys, Ctr Mol Biomed, D-07745 Jena, Germany","Wicher, D (reprint author), Max Planck Inst Chem Ecol, Dept Evolutionary Neuroethol, Hans Knoll St 8, D-07745 Jena, Germany.",dwicher@ice.mpg.de,"Marion-Poll, Frederic/D-8882-2011; Hansson, Bill/G-2774-2013","Marion-Poll, Frederic/0000-0001-6824-0180; Hansson, Bill/0000-0002-4811-1223; Heinemann, Stefan H./0000-0002-4144-0251",,,,28,416,451,5,81,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,24-Apr,2008,452,7190,,,,,1007,U10,,10.1038/nature06861,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,291PF,WOS:000255208600042,18408711,No,Y,N,11/20/17

The upper intestine has a critical role in nutrient digestion and absorption. However, studies indicate that upper intestinal lipids inhibit food intake as well in rodents and humans by the activation of an intestine - brain axis(1-4). In parallel, a brain - liver axis has recently been proposed to detect blood lipids to inhibit glucose production in rodents(5). Thus, we tested the hypothesis that upper intestinal lipids activate an intestine - brain - liver neural axis to regulate glucose homeostasis. Here we demonstrate that direct administration of lipids into the upper intestine increased upper intestinal long- chain fatty acyl-coenzyme A ( LCFA- CoA) levels and suppressed glucose production. Co- infusion of the acyl- CoA synthase inhibitor triacsin C or the anaesthetic tetracaine with duodenal lipids abolished the inhibition of glucose production, indicating that upper intestinal LCFA- CoAs regulate glucose production in the preabsorptive state. Subdiaphragmatic vagotomy or gut vagal deafferentation interrupts the neural connection between the gut and the brain, and blocks the ability of upper intestinal lipids to inhibit glucose production. Direct administration of the N- methyl- D- aspartate ion channel blocker MK- 801 into the fourth ventricle or the nucleus of the solitary tract where gut sensory fibres terminate abolished the upper- intestinal- lipid- induced inhibition of glucose production. Finally, hepatic vagotomy negated the inhibitory effects of upper intestinal lipids on glucose production. These findings indicate that upper intestinal lipids activate an intestine - brain - liver neural axis to inhibit glucose production, and thereby reveal a previously unappreciated pathway that regulates glucose homeostasis.","[Wang, Penny Y.

This activation is mainly induced by the cytoplasmic elongation of their poly( A) tails, which is mediated by the cytoplasmic polyadenylation element ( CPE) present in their 39 untranslated regions(1,2). In Xenopus oocytes, sequential phase-specific translation of CPE- regulated mRNAs is required to activate the maturation- promoting factor, which in turn mediates entry into the two consecutive meiotic metaphases ( MI and MII)(3-6). Here we report a genome- wide functional screening to identify previously unknown mRNAs cytoplasmically polyadenylated at meiotic phase transitions. A significant fraction of transcripts containing, in addition to CPEs, ( A+U)- rich element ( ARE) sequences ( characteristic of mRNAs regulated by deadenylation(7)) were identified. Among these is the mRNA encoding C3H-4, an ARE- binding protein that we find to accumulate in MI and the ablation of which induces meiotic arrest. Our results suggest that C3H- 4 recruits the CCR4 deadenylase complex to ARE-containing mRNAs and this, in turn, causes shortening of poly( A) tails. We also show that the opposing activities of the CPEs and the AREs define the precise activation times of the mRNAs encoding the anaphase- promoting complex inhibitors Emi1 and Emi2 during distinct phases of the meiotic cycle. Taken together, our results show that an 'early' wave of cytoplasmic polyadenylation activates a negative feedback loop by activating the synthesis of C3H- 4, which in turn would recruit the deadenylase complex to mRNAs containing both CPEs and AREs. This negative feedback loop is required to exit from metaphase into interkinesis and for meiotic progression.","[Belloc, Eulalia; Mendez, Raul] Pompeu Fabra Univ, Ctr Genom Regulat, Barcelona 08003, Spain","Mendez, R (reprint author), Pompeu Fabra Univ, Ctr Genom Regulat, C Dr Aiguader 88, Barcelona 08003, Spain.",raul.mendez@crg.es,,"Mendez, Raul/0000-0002-1952-6905",,,,34,56,58,0,7,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,24-Apr,2008,452,7190,,,,,1017,U11,,10.1038/nature06809,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,291PF,WOS:000255208600044,18385675,No,,,11/20/17

A 'genetic switch' enables the phage to transition from lysogenic growth to lytic development when triggered by specific environmental conditions. The key component of the switch is the cI repressor, which binds to two sets of three operator sites on the lambda chromosome that are separated by about 2,400 base pairs (bp)(2,3). A hallmark of the lambda system is the pairwise cooperativity of repressor binding(4). In the absence of detailed structural information, it has been difficult to understand fully how repressor molecules establish the cooperativity complex. Here we present the X- ray crystal structure of the intact lambda cI repressor dimer bound to a DNA operator site. The structure of the repressor, determined by multiple isomorphous replacement methods, reveals an unusual overall architecture that allows it to adopt a conformation that appears to facilitate pairwise cooperative binding to adjacent operator sites.","[Stayrook, Steven; Jaru-Ampornpan, Peera; Ni, Jenny; Lewis, Mitchell] Univ Penn, Sch Med, Dept Biochem & Biophys, Philadelphia, PA 19102 USA; [Hochschild, Ann] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Microbiol & Mol Genet, Boston, MA 02115 USA","Lewis, M (reprint author), Univ Penn, Sch Med, Dept Biochem & Biophys, 37th & Hamilton Walk, Philadelphia, PA 19102 USA.",lewis@mail.med.upenn.edu,,,NIGMS NIH HHS [R01 GM044025],,,23,49,49,1,10,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,24-Apr,2008,452,7190,,,,,1022,U12,,10.1038/nature06831,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,291PF,WOS:000255208600045,18432246,No,,,11/20/17

Current flows along the sample edges and is carried by charged excitations ( quasiparticles) whose charge is a fraction of the electron charge. Although earlier research concentrated on odd denominator fractional values of nu, the observation of the even denominator nu = 5/2 state sparked much interest. This state is conjectured to be characterized by quasiparticles of charge e/4, whose statistics are 'non- abelian' - in other words, interchanging two quasiparticles may modify the state of the system into a different one, rather than just adding a phase as is the case for fermions or bosons. As such, these quasiparticles may be useful for the construction of a topological quantum computer. Here we report data on shot noise generated by partitioning edge currents in the nu = 5/2 state, consistent with the charge of the quasiparticle being e/4, and inconsistent with other possible values, such as e/2 and e.

However, it is not clear why. Here we distinguish among three major competing mechanisms for this phenomenon, by using the 50- year California Cooperative Oceanic Fisheries Investigations ( CalCOFI) larval fish record. First, variable fishing pressure directly increases variability in exploited populations. Second, commercial fishing can decrease the average body size and age of a stock, causing the truncated population to track environmental fluctuations directly. Third, age- truncated or juvenescent populations have increasingly unstable population dynamics because of changing demographic parameters such as intrinsic growth rates. We find no evidence for the first hypothesis, limited evidence for the second and strong evidence for the third. Therefore, in California Current fisheries, increased temporal variability in the population does not arise from variable exploitation, nor does it reflect direct environmental tracking. More fundamentally, it arises from increased instability in dynamics. This finding has implications for resource management as an empirical example of how selective harvesting can alter the basic dynamics of exploited populations, and lead to unstable booms and busts that can precede systematic declines in stock levels.","[Anderson, Christian N.

Here we show that similar to 95% of new networks are tolerated by the bacteria, that very few alter growth, and that expression level correlates with factor position in the wild- type network hierarchy.

Our data provide insights into the spliceosome's catalytic RNP domain and indicate a central role for the aforementioned proteins in sustaining its catalytically active structure.","[Bessonov, Sergey; Anokhina, Maria; Will, Cindy L.; Luehrmann, Reinhard] Max Planck Inst Biophys Chem, Dept Cellular Biochem, D-37077 Gottingen, Germany; [Urlaub, Henning] Max Planck Inst Biophys Chem, Bioanalyt Mass Spectrometry Grp, D-37077 Gottingen, Germany","Luhrmann, R (reprint author), Max Planck Inst Biophys Chem, Dept Cellular Biochem, D-37077 Gottingen, Germany.",reinhard.luehrmann@mpi-bpc.mpg.de,,,,,,27,212,218,1,12,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,17-Apr,2008,452,7189,,,,,846,U3,,10.1038/nature06842,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,288ZY,WOS:000255026000042,18322460,No,,,11/20/17

Here we report such a test in a close binary system of two candidate black holes in the quasar OJ 287. This quasar shows quasi- periodic optical outbursts at 12- year intervals, with two outburst peaks per interval(9,10). The latest outburst occurred in September 2007, within a day of the time predicted by the binary black- hole model and general relativity(11). The observations confirm the binary nature of the system and also provide evidence for the loss of orbital energy in agreement ( within 10 per cent) with the emission of gravitational waves from the system(12).

Recently, meaningful experimental studies(1,2) of the problem have become possible, stimulating theoretical interest(3-7). In generic isolated systems, non- equilibrium dynamics is expected(8,9) to result in thermalization: a relaxation to states in which the values of macroscopic quantities are stationary, universal with respect to widely differing initial conditions, and predictable using statistical mechanics. However, it is not obvious what feature of many- body quantum mechanics makes quantum thermalization possible in a sense analogous to that in which dynamical chaos makes classical thermalization possible(10). For example, dynamical chaos itself cannot occur in an isolated quantum system, in which the time evolution is linear and the spectrum is discrete(11). Some recent studies(4,5) even suggest that statistical mechanics may give incorrect predictions for the outcomes of relaxation in such systems. Here we demonstrate that a generic isolated quantum many- body system does relax to a state well described by the standard statistical- mechanical prescription. Moreover, we show that time evolution itself plays a merely auxiliary role in relaxation, and that thermalization instead happens at the level of individual eigenstates, as first proposed by Deutsch(12) and Srednicki(13). A striking consequence of this eigenstate- thermalization scenario, confirmed for our system, is that knowledge of a single many- body eigenstate is sufficient to compute thermal averages - any eigenstate in the microcanonical energy window will do, because they all give the same result.","[Rigol, Marcos; Dunjko, Vanja] Univ So Calif, Dept Phys & Astron, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA; [Rigol, Marcos; Dunjko, Vanja; Olshanii, Maxim] Univ Massachusetts, Dept Phys, Boston, MA 02125 USA","Olshanii, M (reprint author), Univ So Calif, Dept Phys & Astron, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA.",maxim.olchanyi@umb.edu,"Rigol, Marcos/B-3505-2008; Olshanii, Maxim/M-2830-2013","Rigol, Marcos/0000-0002-5806-5873; Olshanii, Maxim/0000-0003-3629-6002",,,,30,933,933,5,75,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,17-Apr,2008,452,7189,,,,,854,858,,10.1038/nature06838,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,288ZY,WOS:000255026000044,18421349,No,Y,N,11/20/17

In contrast, much less attention has been paid to the effects of domains and domain walls on the electrical properties of antiferromagnets: antiferromagnetic domains show no net external magnetic moment, and so are difficult to manipulate or probe. Here we describe electrical measurements on chromium - a simple metal and quintessential spin density wave antiferromagnet(3) - that show behaviour directly related to spin density wave formation and the presence of antiferromagnetic domains. Two types of thermal hysteresis are seen in both longitudinal and Hall resistivity: the first can be explained by the quantization of spin density waves due to the finite film thickness ( confirmed by X- ray diffraction measurements) and the second by domain- wall scattering of electrons(4,5). We also observe the striking influence of the electrical lead configuration ( a mesoscopic effect) on the resistivity of macroscopic samples in the spin density wave state. Our results are potentially of practical importance, in that they reveal tunable electrical effects of film thickness and domain walls that are as large as the highest seen for ferromagnets(6,7).","[Kummamuru, Ravi K.; Soh, Yeong-Ah] Dartmouth Coll, Dept Phys & Astron, Hanover, NH 03755 USA","Soh, YA (reprint author), Univ Illinois, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, 1304 W Green St, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.",yeong-ah.soh@dartmouth.edu,"Kummamuru, Ravi/C-3890-2009",,,,,32,31,31,2,33,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,17-Apr,2008,452,7189,,,,,859,U4,,10.1038/nature06826,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,288ZY,WOS:000255026000045,18421350,No,,,11/20/17

Here we present an ice core record of carbon isotopic ratios in methane over the entire last glacial - interglacial transition. Our data show that the carbon in atmospheric methane was isotopically much heavier in cold climate periods. With the help of a box model constrained by the present data and previously published results(6,8), we are able to estimate the magnitude of past individual methane emission sources and the atmospheric lifetime of methane. We find that methane emissions due to biomass burning were about 45 Tg methane per year, and that these remained roughly constant throughout the glacial termination. The atmospheric lifetime of methane is reduced during cold climate periods.

Here we describe a sophisticated feeding apparatus from an Early Cambrian arthropod that had a body length of several centimetres. Details of the mouthparts resolve this taxon as a probable crown- group ( pan) crustacean, while its feeding style, which allowed it to generate and handle fine food particles, significantly expands the known ecological capabilities of Cambrian arthropods.

However, the formidable size of the diploid human genome(1), approximately 6 gigabases, has prevented the routine application of sequencing methods to deciphering complete individual human genomes. To realize the full potential of genomics for human health, this limitation must be overcome. Here we report the DNA sequence of a diploid genome of a single individual, James D. Watson, sequenced to 7.4- fold redundancy in two months using massively parallel sequencing in picolitre- size reaction vessels. This sequence was completed in two months at approximately one-hundredth of the cost of traditional capillary electrophoresis methods. Comparison of the sequence to the reference genome led to the identification of 3.3 million single nucleotide polymorphisms, of which 10,654 cause amino- acid substitution within the coding sequence. In addition, we accurately identified small-scale ( 2 - 40,000 base pair ( bp)) insertion and deletion polymorphism as well as copy number variation resulting in the large- scale gain and loss of chromosomal segments ranging from 26,000 to 1.5 million base pairs. Overall, these results agree well with recent results of sequencing of a single individual(2) by traditional methods. However, in addition to being faster and significantly less expensive, this sequencing technology avoids the arbitrary loss of genomic sequences inherent in random shotgun sequencing by bacterial cloning because it amplifies DNA in a cell- free system. As a result, we further demonstrate the acquisition of novel human sequence, including novel genes not previously identified by traditional genomic sequencing. This is the first genome sequenced by next- generation technologies. Therefore it is a pilot for the future challenges of 'personalized genome sequencing'.","[Wheeler, David A.; Chen, Lei; Song, Xing-zhi; Liu, Yue; Yuan, Ye; Nazareth, Lynne; Qin, Xiang; Muzny, Donna M.; Weinstock, George M.; Gibbs, Richard A.] Baylor Coll Med, Human Genome Sequencing Ctr, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [McGuire, Amy] Baylor Coll Med, Ctr Eth & Hlth Policy, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Lupski, James R.; Chinault, Craig; Weinstock, George M.; Gibbs, Richard A.] Baylor Coll Med, Dept Mol & Human Genet, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Lupski, James R.] Baylor Coll Med, Dept Pediat, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Lupski, James R.] Texas Childrens Hosp, Texas Med Ctr, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Srinivasan, Maithreyan; Egholm, Michael; He, Wen; Chen, Yi-Ju; Makhijani, Vinod; Roth, G.

A critical event in this context is DNA demethylation and the erasure of parental imprints in mouse primordial germ cells ( PGCs) on embryonic day 11.5 ( E11.5) after they enter into the developing gonads(1,2). Little is yet known about the mechanism involved, except that it is apparently an active process. We have examined the associated changes in the chromatin to gain further insights into this reprogramming event. Here we show that the chromatin changes occur in two steps. The first changes in nascent PGCs at E8.5 establish a distinctive chromatin signature that is reminiscent of pluripotency. Next, when PGCs are residing in the gonads, major changes occur in nuclear architecture accompanied by an extensive erasure of several histone modifications and exchange of histone variants. Furthermore, the histone chaperones HIRA and NAP- 1 ( NAP111), which are implicated in histone exchange, accumulate in PGC nuclei undergoing reprogramming. We therefore suggest that the mechanism of histone replacement is critical for these chromatin rearrangements to occur. The marked chromatin changes are intimately linked with genome- wide DNA demethylation. On the basis of the timing of the observed events, we propose that if DNA demethylation entails a DNA repair- based mechanism, the evident histone replacement would represent a repair- induced response event rather than being a prerequisite.","[Hajkova, Petra; Ancelin, Katia; Lange, Ulrike C.; Cesari, Francesca; Lee, Caroline; Surani, M.

Here we add an integral growth component to this model by showing that Shh- dependent proliferation of prospective digit progenitor cells is essential for specifying the complete pattern of digits across the anteroposterior axis. Inhibiting Shh signalling in early wing buds reduced anteroposterior expansion, and posterior digits were lost because all prospective digit precursors formed anterior structures. Inhibiting proliferation also irreversibly reduced anteroposterior expansion, but instead anterior digits were lost because all prospective digit precursors formed posterior structures. When proliferation recovered in such wings, Shh transcription was maintained for longer than normal, suggesting that duration of Shh expression is controlled by a mechanism that measures proliferation. Rescue experiments confirmed that Shh- dependent proliferation controls digit number during a discrete time- window in which Shh- dependent specification normally occurs. Our findings that Shh signalling has dual functions that can be temporally uncoupled have implications for understanding congenital and evolutionary digit reductions.","[Towers, Matthew; Mahood, Ruth; Yin, Yili; Tickle, Cheryll] Univ Dundee, Dept Dev & Cell Biol, Dundee DD1 5EH, Scotland","Tickle, C (reprint author), Univ Bath, Dept Biol & Biochem, Bath BA2 7AY, Avon, England.",cat24@bath.ac.uk,,,Medical Research Council [G9806660],,,30,126,128,0,14,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,17-Apr,2008,452,7189,,,,,882,U7,,10.1038/nature06718,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,288ZY,WOS:000255026000050,18354396,No,,,11/20/17

Although the precise cause is often unknown, many neurodegenerative diseases share common features such as protein aggregation and age dependence. Recent studies in Drosophila have uncovered protective effects of NAD synthase nicotinamide mononucleotide adenylyltransferase ( NMNAT) against activity-induced neurodegeneration and injury- induced axonal degeneration(1,2). Here we show that NMNAT overexpression can also protect against spinocerebellar ataxia 1 ( SCA1)- induced neurodegeneration, suggesting a general neuroprotective function of NMNAT. It protects against neurodegeneration partly through a proteasome-mediated pathway in a manner similar to heat- shock protein 70 ( Hsp70). NMNAT displays chaperone function both in biochemical assays and cultured cells, and it shares significant structural similarity with known chaperones. Furthermore, it is upregulated in the brain upon overexpression of poly- glutamine expanded protein and recruited with the chaperone Hsp70 into protein aggregates. Our results implicate NMNAT as a stress- response protein that acts as a chaperone for neuronal maintenance and protection. Our studies provide an entry point for understanding how normal neurons maintain activity, and offer clues for the common mechanisms underlying different neurodegenerative conditions.","[Zhai, R.

Neighbouring retinal ganglion cells ( RGCs) project their axons to neighbouring positions in the optic tectum, thus reestablishing a continuous neural representation of visual space. Mapping along this axis requires chemorepellent signalling from tectal cells, expressing ephrin- A ligands, to retinal growth cones, expressing EphA receptors(4). High concentrations of ephrin A, increasing from anterior to posterior, prevent temporal axons from invading the posterior tectum. However, the force that drives nasal axons to extend past the anterior tectum and terminate in posterior regions remains to be identified. We tested whether axon - axon interactions, such as competition, are required for posterior tectum innervation. By transplanting blastomeres from a wild- type ( WT) zebrafish into a lakritz ( lak) mutant, which lacks all RGCs(5), we created chimaeras with eyes that contained single RGCs. These solitary RGCs often extended axons into the tectum, where they branched to form a terminal arbor. Here we show that the distal tips of these arbors were positioned at retinotopically appropriate positions, ruling out an essential role for competition in innervation of the ephrin- A- rich posterior tectum. However, solitary arbors were larger and more complex than under normal, crowded conditions, owing to a lack of pruning of proximal branches during refinement of the retinotectal projection. We conclude that dense innervation is not required for targeting of retinal axons within the zebrafish tectum but serves to restrict arbor size and shape.","[Gosse, Nathan J.; Baier, Herwig] Univ Calif San Francisco, Program Dev Biol, San Francisco, CA 94158 USA; [Nevin, Linda M.; Baier, Herwig] Univ Calif San Francisco, Neurosci Program, San Francisco, CA 94158 USA","Baier, H (reprint author), Univ Calif San Francisco, Program Dev Biol, 1550 4th St, San Francisco, CA 94158 USA.",herwig.baier@ucsf.edu,,,"NEI NIH HHS [R01 EY012406-09, R01 EY012406, R01 EY012406-06A2, R01 EY012406-07, R01 EY012406-08, R01 EY013855, R01 EY013855-01A1, R01 EY013855-02, R01 EY013855-03, R01 EY013855-04, R01 EY013855-05, R01 EY013855-06, R01 EY013855-07, R01 EY013855-08]",,,31,53,54,0,5,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,17-Apr,2008,452,7189,,,,,892,U9,,10.1038/nature06816,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,288ZY,WOS:000255026000052,18368050,No,,,11/20/17

Despite recent progress in silencing of miRNAs in rodents(5,6), the development of effective and safe approaches for sequence-specific antagonism of miRNAs in vivo remains a significant scientific and therapeutic challenge. Moreover, there are no reports of miRNA antagonism in primates. Here we show that the simple systemic delivery of a unconjugated, PBS- formulated locked- nucleic- acid- modified oligonucleotide ( LNA- antimiR) effectively antagonizes the liver- expressed miR- 122 in non- human primates. Acute administration by intravenous injections of 3 or 10 mg kg(-1) LNA- antimiR to African green monkeys resulted in uptake of the LNA- antimiR in the cytoplasm of primate hepatocytes and formation of stable heteroduplexes between the LNA-antimiR and miR- 122. This was accompanied by depletion of mature miR- 122 and dose- dependent lowering of plasma cholesterol. Efficient silencing of miR- 122 was achieved in primates by three doses of 10 mg kg(-1) LNA- antimiR, leading to a long- lasting and reversible decrease in total plasma cholesterol without any evidence for LNA- associated toxicities or histopathological changes in the study animals. Our findings demonstrate the utility of systemically administered LNA- antimiRs in exploring miRNA function in rodents and primates, and support the potential of these compounds as a new class of therapeutics for disease-associated miRNAs.","[Elmen, Joacim; Lindow, Morten; Petri, Andreas; Obad, Susanna; Lindholm, Marie; Hedtjarn, Maj; Kearney, Phil; Straarup, Ellen Marie; Kauppinen, Sakari] Santaris Pharma, DK-2970 Horsholm, Denmark; [Schutz, Sylvia; Sarnow, Peter] Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Dept Microbiol & Immunol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Lawrence, Matthew; Gullans, Steven] RxGen Inc, Hamden, CT 06517 USA; [Berger, Urs] UB In situ, Natick, MA 01760 USA; [Kauppinen, Sakari] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Cellular & Mol Med, Wilhelm Johannsen Ctr Funct Genome Res, DK-2200 Copenhagen N, Denmark","Kauppinen, S (reprint author), Santaris Pharma, Boge Allee 3, DK-2970 Horsholm, Denmark.",sk@santaris.com,"Lindholm, Marie/B-8736-2015","Lindholm, Marie/0000-0003-4309-3203",,,,25,1024,1074,6,106,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,17-Apr,2008,452,7189,,,,,896,U10,,10.1038/nature06783,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,288ZY,WOS:000255026000053,18368051,No,Y,N,11/20/17

In all known polyglutamine diseases, the glutamine expansion confers toxic functions onto the protein; however, the mechanism by which this occurs remains enigmatic, in light of the fact that the mutant protein apparently maintains interactions with its usual partners. Here we show that the expanded polyglutamine tract differentially affects the function of the host protein in the context of different endogenous protein complexes. Polyglutamine expansion in ATXN1 favours the formation of a particular protein complex containing RBM17, contributing to SCA1 neuropathology by means of a gain-of-function mechanism. Concomitantly, polyglutamine expansion attenuates the formation and function of another protein complex containing ATXN1 and capicua, contributing to SCA1 through a partial loss-of-function mechanism. This model provides mechanistic insight into the molecular pathogenesis of SCA1 as well as other polyglutamine diseases.","[Lim, Janghoo; Jafar-Nejad, Paymaan; Bowman, Aaron B.; Zoghbi, Huda Y.] Baylor Coll Med, Dept Mol & Human Genet, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Crespo-Barreto, Juan; Zoghbi, Huda Y.] Baylor Coll Med, Interdept Program Cell & Mol Biol, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Zoghbi, Huda Y.] Baylor Coll Med, Dept Pediat, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Zoghbi, Huda Y.] Baylor Coll Med, Dept Neurosci, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Richman, Ronald; Zoghbi, Huda Y.] Baylor Coll Med, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Hill, David E.] Dana Farber Canc Inst, Ctr Canc Syst Biol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Hill, David E.] Dana Farber Canc Inst, Dept Canc Biol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Hill, David E.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Genet, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Orr, Harry T.] Univ Minnesota, Inst Human Genet, Dept Biochem Biophys & Mol Biol, Dept Lab Med & Pathol, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA","Zoghbi, HY (reprint author), Baylor Coll Med, Dept Mol & Human Genet, Houston, TX 77030 USA.",hzoghbi@bcm.tmc.edu,"Hill, David/B-6617-2011","Bowman, Aaron/0000-0001-8728-3346","Howard Hughes Medical Institute; NICHD NIH HHS [P30 HD024064, P30 HD024064-19]; NINDS NIH HHS [R01 NS027699, R01 NS027699-19]",,,43,179,181,1,15,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,10-Apr,2008,452,7188,,,,,713,U1,,10.1038/nature06731,,7,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,285QY,WOS:000254792500037,18337722,No,,,11/20/17

By contrast, very few of their non-endocytic trafficking roles are known, the best characterized being the transport of hydrolases from the Golgi complex to the lysosome. Here we show that clathrin is required for polarity of the basolateral plasma membrane proteins in the epithelial cell line MDCK. Clathrin knockdown depolarized most basolateral proteins, by interfering with their biosynthetic delivery and recycling, but did not affect the polarity of apical proteins. Quantitative live imaging showed that chronic and acute clathrin knockdown selectively slowed down the exit of basolateral proteins from the Golgi complex, and promoted their mis-sorting into apical carrier vesicles.

Fluctuations involving a small fraction of a statistical ensemble of systems interacting with the bath result in deviations from this trend. In this respect, quantum and classical thermodynamics are in agreement(1-5). Here we predict a different trend in a purely quantum mechanical setting: disturbances of thermal equilibrium between two-level systems (TLSs) and a bath(6), caused by frequent, brief quantum non-demolition(7-10) measurements of the TLS energy states. By making the measurements increasingly frequent, we encounter first the anti-Zeno regime and then the Zeno regime (namely where the TLSs' relaxation respectively speeds up and slows down(11-15)). The corresponding entropy and temperature of both the system and the bath are then found to either decrease or increase depending only on the rate of observation, contrary to the standard thermodynamical rules that hold for memory-less ( Markov) baths(2,5). From a practical viewpoint, these anomalies may offer the possibility of very fast control of heat and entropy in quantum systems, allowing cooling and state purification over an interval much shorter than the time needed for thermal equilibration or for a feedback control loop.","[Erez, Noam; Gordon, Goren; Kurizki, Gershon] Weizmann Inst Sci, Dept Chem Phys, IL-76100 Rehovot, Israel; [Nest, Mathias] Univ Potsdam, D-14476 Potsdam, Germany","Kurizki, G (reprint author), Weizmann Inst Sci, Dept Chem Phys, IL-76100 Rehovot, Israel.",gershon.kurizki@weizmann.ac.il,"Nest, Mathias/C-1412-2010",,,,,24,104,106,0,23,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,10-Apr,2008,452,7188,,,,,724,727,,10.1038/nature06873,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,285QY,WOS:000254792500039,18401404,No,,,11/20/17

In view of potential applications of such structures-for example, subwavelength optics(2,3), optoelectronics devices(4,5), and chemical sensing(6) - it is important to understand the underlying physical processes in detail. Here we derive a microscopic theory of the transmission through subwavelength hole arrays, by considering the elementary processes associated with scattering of surface-plasmon-polariton (SPP) modes by individual one-dimensional chains of subwavelength holes. Using a SPP coupled-mode model that coherently gathers these elementary processes, we derive analytical expressions for all the transmission spectrum characteristics - such as the resonance wavelength, the peak transmission and the anti-resonance. Further comparisons of the model predictions with fully vectorial computational results allow us quantitatively to check the model accuracy and to discuss the respective impacts of SPP modes and of other electromagnetic fields on producing the extraordinary transmission of light.

Ferroelectric superlattices(6) allow the tuning of the ferroelectric properties while maintaining perfect crystal structure and a coherent strain, even throughout relatively thick samples. This tuning is achieved in practice by adjusting both the strain(7-10), to enhance the polarization, and the composition, to interpolate between the properties of the combined compounds(11-15). Here we show that superlattices with very short periods possess a new form of interface coupling, based on rotational distortions, which gives rise to 'improper' ferroelectricity. These observations suggest an approach, based on interface engineering, to produce artificial materials with unique properties. By considering ferroelectric/paraelectric PbTiO3/SrTiO3 multilayers, we first show from first principles that the groundstate of the system is not purely ferroelectric but also primarily involves antiferrodistortive rotations of the oxygen atoms in a way compatible with improper ferroelectricity. We then demonstrate experimentally that, in contrast to pure PbTiO3 and SrTiO3 compounds, the multilayer system indeed behaves like a prototypical improper ferroelectric and exhibits a very large dielectric constant of epsilon(r)approximate to 600, which is also fairly temperature-independent. This behaviour, of practical interest for technological applications(16), is distinct from that of normal ferroelectrics, for which the dielectric constant is typically large but strongly evolves around the phase transition temperature and also differs from that of previously known improper ferroelectrics that exhibit a temperature-independent but small dielectric constant only.","[Bousquet, Eric; Hermet, Patrick; Ghosez, Philippe] Univ Liege, B-4000 Sart Tilman Par Liege, Belgium; [Dawber, Matthew; Stucki, Nicolas; Lichtensteiger, Celine; Gariglio, Stefano; Triscone, Jean-Marc] Univ Geneva, DPMC, CH-1211 Geneva 4, Switzerland","Ghosez, P (reprint author), Univ Liege, Allee 6 Aout 17 B5, B-4000 Sart Tilman Par Liege, Belgium.",matthew.dawber@stonybrook.edu; philippe.ghosez@ulg.ac.be,"Ghosez, Philippe/F-1954-2014",,,,,35,415,417,31,364,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,10-Apr,2008,452,7188,,,,,732,U4,,10.1038/nature06817,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,285QY,WOS:000254792500041,18401406,No,Y,N,11/20/17

The oxidation is mainly initiated by hydroxyl radicals (OH), primarily formed through the photodissociation of ozone(4). Previously it was thought that, in unpolluted air, biogenic VOCs deplete OH and reduce the atmospheric oxidation capacity(5-10). Conversely, in polluted air VOC oxidation leads to noxious oxidant build-up by the catalytic action of nitrogen oxides(5-10) (NOx = NO + NO2). Here we report aircraft measurements of atmospheric trace gases performed over the pristine Amazon forest. Our data reveal unexpectedly high OH concentrations. We propose that natural VOC oxidation, notably of isoprene, recycles OH efficiently in low-NOx air through reactions of organic peroxy radicals. Computations with an atmospheric chemistry model and the results of laboratory experiments suggest that an OH recycling efficiency of 40-80 per cent in isoprene oxidation may be able to explain the high OH levels we observed in the field. Although further laboratory studies are necessary to explore the chemical mechanism responsible for OH recycling in more detail, our results demonstrate that the biosphere maintains a remarkable balance with the atmospheric environment.","[Lelieveld, J.; Butler, T.

Here we show that SAR11 requires exogenous sources of reduced sulphur, such as methionine or 3-dimethylsulphoniopropionate (DMSP) for growth. Titrations of the algal osmolyte DMSP in seawater medium containing all other macronutrients in excess showed that 1.5 x 10(8) SAR11 cells are produced per nanomole of DMSP.

These new hypotheses include a clade of moulting animals (Ecdysozoa)(3) and the close relationship of the lophophorates to molluscs and annelids (Lophotrochozoa)(4). Many relationships remain disputed, including those that are required to polarize key features of character evolution, and support for deep nodes is often low. Phylogenomic approaches, which use data from many genes, have shown promise for resolving deep animal relationships, but are hindered by a lack of data from many important groups. Here we report a total of 39.9 Mb of expressed sequence tags from 29 animals belonging to 21 phyla, including 11 phyla previously lacking genomic or expressed-sequence-tag data. Analysed in combination with existing sequences, our data reinforce several previously identified clades that split deeply in the animal tree (including Protostomia, Ecdysozoa and Lophotrochozoa), unambiguously resolve multiple long-standing issues for which there was strong conflicting support in earlier studies with less data (such as velvet worms rather than tardigrades as the sister group of arthropods(5)), and provide molecular support for the monophyly of molluscs, a group long recognized by morphologists. In addition, we find strong support for several new hypotheses. These include a clade that unites annelids (including sipunculans and echiurans) with nemerteans, phoronids and brachiopods, molluscs as sister to that assemblage, and the placement of ctenophores as the earliest diverging extant multicellular animals. A single origin of spiral cleavage (with subsequent losses) is inferred from well-supported nodes. Many relationships between a stable subset of taxa find strong support, and a diminishing number of lineages remain recalcitrant to placement on the tree.","[Dunn, Casey W.; Hejnol, Andreas; Matus, David Q.; Pang, Kevin; Browne, William E.; Seaver, Elaine; Martindale, Mark Q.] Univ Hawaii, Kewalo Marine Lab, PBRC, Honolulu, HI 96813 USA; [Smith, Stephen A.] Yale Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Rouse, Greg W.] Univ Calif San Diego, Scripps Inst Oceanog, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Obst, Matthias] Kristineberg Marine Res Stn, S-45034 Fiskebackskil, Sweden; [Edgecombe, Gregory D.] Nat Hist Museum, Dept Palaeontol, London SW7 5BD, England; [Sorensen, Martin V.] Univ Copenhagen, Ancient DNA & Evolut Grp, Inst Biol, DK-2100 Copenhagen, Denmark; [Haddock, Steven H.

Although pre-pandemic vaccines and antiviral drugs might significantly reduce illness rates(1,2), their stockpiling is too expensive to be practical for many countries. Consequently, alternative control strategies, based on non-pharmaceutical interventions, are a potentially attractive policy option. School closure is the measure most often considered. The high social and economic costs of closing schools for months make it an expensive and therefore controversial policy, and the current absence of quantitative data on the role of schools during influenza epidemics means there is little consensus on the probable effectiveness of school closure in reducing the impact of a pandemic. Here, from the joint analysis of surveillance data and holiday timing in France, we quantify the role of schools in influenza epidemics and predict the effect of school closure during a pandemic. We show that holidays lead to a 20 - 29% reduction in the rate at which influenza is transmitted to children, but that they have no detectable effect on the contact patterns of adults. Holidays prevent 16 - 18% of seasonal influenza cases (18 - 21% in children). By extrapolation, we find that prolonged school closure during a pandemic might reduce the cumulative number of cases by 13 - 17% (18 - 23% in children) and peak attack rates by up to 39 - 45% (47 - 52% in children). The impact of school closure would be reduced if it proved difficult to maintain low contact rates among children for a prolonged period.","[Cauchemez, Simon; Ferguson, Neil M.] Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, MRC Ctr Outbreak Anal & Modelling, Dept Infect Dis Epidemiol, London W2 1PG, England; [Valleron, Alain-Jacques; Boelle, Pierre-Yves; Flahault, Antoine] Univ Paris 06, UMR S707, F-75012 Paris, France; [Valleron, Alain-Jacques; Boelle, Pierre-Yves; Flahault, Antoine] INSERM, UMR S 707, F-75012 Paris, France; [Valleron, Alain-Jacques; Boelle, Pierre-Yves] Hop St Antoine, AP HP, F-75012 Paris, France; [Flahault, Antoine] French Sch Publ Hlth EHESP, F-75004 Paris, France","Cauchemez, S (reprint author), Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, MRC Ctr Outbreak Anal & Modelling, Dept Infect Dis Epidemiol, Norfolk Pl, London W2 1PG, England.",s.cauchemez@imperial.ac.uk,"Ferguson, Neil/B-8578-2008; Chiang, Vincent, Ming-Hsien/D-4312-2016","Ferguson, Neil/0000-0002-1154-8093; Chiang, Vincent, Ming-Hsien/0000-0002-2029-7863; Boelle, Pierre-Yves/0000-0002-5367-8232",,,,22,274,284,3,26,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,10-Apr,2008,452,7188,,,,,750,U6,,10.1038/nature06732,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,285QY,WOS:000254792500045,18401408,No,Y,N,11/20/17

In most cases, the mode of action of effectors remains unknown. Strains of Pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae (Pss) secrete syringolin A (SylA), a product of a mixed non-ribosomal peptide/polyketide synthetase, in planta(1). Here we identify SylA as a virulence factor because a SylA-negative mutant in Pss strain B728a obtained by gene disruption was markedly less virulent on its host, Phaseolus vulgaris (bean). We show that SylA irreversibly inhibits all three catalytic activities of eukaryotic proteasomes, thus adding proteasome inhibition to the repertoire of modes of action of virulence factors. The crystal structure of the yeast proteasome in complex with SylA revealed a novel mechanism of covalent binding to the catalytic subunits. Thus, SylA defines a new class of proteasome inhibitors that includes glidobactin A (GlbA), a structurally related compound from an unknown species of the order Burkholderiales(2), for which we demonstrate a similar proteasome inhibition mechanism. As proteasome inhibitors are a promising class of anti-tumour agents, the discovery of a novel family of inhibitory natural products, which we refer to as syrbactins, may also have implications for the development of anti-cancer drugs(3). Homologues of SylA and GlbA synthetase genes are found in some other pathogenic bacteria, including the human pathogen Burkholderia pseudomallei, the causative agent of melioidosis(4). It is thus possible that these bacteria are capable of producing proteasome inhibitors of the syrbactin class.","[Schellenberg, Barbara; Dudler, Robert] Univ Zurich, Inst Plant Biol, Zurich Basel Plant Sci Ctr, CH-8008 Zurich, Switzerland; [Groll, Michael] Tech Univ Munich, Ctr Integrated Prot Sci, Dept Chem, Lehrstuhl Biochem, D-85747 Garching, Germany; [Bachmann, Andre S.; Archer, Crystal R.] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Canc Res Ctr Hawaii, Honolulu, HI 96813 USA; [Bachmann, Andre S.; Archer, Crystal R.] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Cell & Mol Biol Grad Program, John A Burns Sch Med, Honolulu, HI 96813 USA; [Huber, Robert] Max Planck Inst Biochem, D-82152 Martinsried, Germany; [Huber, Robert] Cardiff Univ, Sch Biosci, Cardiff CF10 3US, Wales; [Huber, Robert] Univ Duisburg Essen, Zentrum Med Biotechnol, D-45117 Essen, Germany; [Powell, Tracy K.; Lindow, Steven] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Plant & Microbial Biol, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Kaiser, Markus] Max Planck Soc, Chem Genom Ctr, D-44227 Dortmund, Germany","Dudler, R (reprint author), Univ Zurich, Inst Plant Biol, Zurich Basel Plant Sci Ctr, Zollikerstr 107, CH-8008 Zurich, Switzerland.",abachmann@crch.hawaii.edu; markus.kaiser@cgc.mpg.de; rdudler@botinst.uzh.ch,"Groll, Michael/C-1174-2010; Groll, Michael/F-5572-2015",,,,,36,197,203,3,48,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,10-Apr,2008,452,7188,,,,,755,U7,,10.1038/nature06782,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,285QY,WOS:000254792500046,18401409,No,Y,N,11/20/17

Whether or not subsets of neurons within complex sympathetic ganglia are predetermined to innervate select end-organs is unknown. Here we demonstrate in mouse embryos that the endothelin family member Edn3 (ref. 1), acting through the endothelin receptor EdnrA (refs 2, 3), directs extension of axons of a subset of sympathetic neurons from the superior cervical ganglion to a preferred intermediate target, the external carotid artery, which serves as the gateway to select targets, including the salivary glands. These findings establish a previously unknown mechanism of axonal pathfinding involving vascular-derived endothelins, and have broad implications for endothelins as general mediators of axonal growth and guidance in the developing nervous system.

Most T cells develop in the thymus, but the lineage potential of thymus-colonizing progenitors is unknown. One approach to resolving this question is to determine the lineage potentials of the earliest thymic progenitors (ETPs). Previous work has shown that ETPs possess T and natural killer lymphoid potentials, and rare subsets of ETPs also possess B lymphoid potential(1), suggesting an origin from lymphoid-restricted progenitor cells. However, whether ETPs also possess myeloid potential is unknown. Here we show that nearly all ETPs in adult mice possess both T and myeloid potential in clonal assays. The existence of progenitors possessing T and myeloid potential within the thymus is incompatible with the current dominant model of haematopoiesis, in which T cells are proposed to arise from lymphoid-restricted progenitors(2).

The classical model of haematopoiesis postulates that, in the first step of differentiation, the stem cell generates common myelo-erythroid progenitors and common lymphoid progenitors (CLPs). However, our previous studies in fetal mice showed that myeloid potential persists even as the lineage branches segregate towards T and B cells(1-6). We therefore proposed the 'myeloid-based' model of haematopoiesis(7,8), in which the stem cell initially generates common myelo-erythroid progenitors and common myelo-lymphoid progenitors. T-cell and B-cell progenitors subsequently arise from common myelo-lymphoid progenitors through myeloid-T and myeloid-B stages, respectively. However, it has been unclear whether this myeloid-based model is also valid for adult haematopoiesis. Here we provide clonal evidence that the early cell populations in the adult thymus contain progenitors that have lost the potential to generate B cells but retain substantial macrophage potential as well as T-cell, natural killer (NK)-cell and dendritic-cell potential. We also show that such T-cell progenitors can give rise to macrophages in the thymic environment in vivo. Our findings argue against the classical dichotomy model in which T cells are derived from CLPs; instead, they support the validity of the 'myeloid-based' model for both adult and fetal haematopoiesis.","[Wada, Haruka; Masuda, Kyoko; Satoh, Rumi; Kakugawa, Kiyokazu; Ikawa, Tomokatsu; Katsura, Yoshimoto; Kawamoto, Hiroshi] RIKEN Res Ctr Allergy & Immunol, Lab Lymphocyte Dev, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2300045, Japan; [Katsura, Yoshimoto] Nihon Univ, Sch Med, Div Cell Regenerat & Transplantat, Adv Med Res Ctr, Tokyo 1738610, Japan","Kawamoto, H (reprint author), RIKEN Res Ctr Allergy & Immunol, Lab Lymphocyte Dev, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2300045, Japan.",kawamoto@rcai.riken.jp,"Wada, Haruka/F-8828-2012",,,,,26,212,223,0,19,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,10-Apr,2008,452,7188,,,,,768,U10,,10.1038/nature06839,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,285QY,WOS:000254792500049,18401412,No,,,11/20/17

Mutations presumed to underlie HIES have recently been identified in stat3, the gene encoding STAT3 (signal transducer and activator of transcription 3) (refs 3, 4). Although impaired production of interferon-gamma and tumour-necrosis factor by T cells(5), diminished memory T-cell populations, decreased delayed-type-hypersensitivity responses and decreased in vitro lymphoproliferation in response to specific antigens(6) have variably been described, specific immunological abnormalities that can explain the unique susceptibility to particular infections seen in HIES have not yet been defined. Here we show that interleukin (IL)-17 production by T cells is absent in HIES individuals. We observed that ex vivo T cells from subjects with HIES failed to produce IL-17, but not IL-2, tumour-necrosis factor or interferon-gamma, on mitogenic stimulation with staphylococcal enterotoxin B or on antigenic stimulation with Candida albicans or streptokinase. Purified naive T cells were unable to differentiate into IL-17-producing (T(H)17) T helper cells in vitro and had lower expression of retinoid-related orphan receptor (ROR)-gamma t, which is consistent with a crucial role for STAT3 signalling in the generation of T(H)17 cells(7-14). T(H)17 cells have emerged as an important subset of helper T cells(15) that are believed to be critical in the clearance of fungal(16) and extracellular bacterial(17) infections. Thus, our data suggest that the inability to produce T(H)17 cells is a mechanism underlying the susceptibility to the recurrent infections commonly seen in HIES.","[Brenchley, Jason M.; Hill, Brenna J.; Asher, Ava I.; Douek, Daniel C.] NIAMSD, Human Immunol Sect, Vaccine Res Ctr, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Milner, Joshua D.; Paul, William E.] NIAMSD, Immunol Lab, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Laurence, Arian; Elias, Kevin M.; Kanno, Yuka; O'Shea, John] NIAMSD, Lymphocyte Cell Biol Sect, Mol Immunol & Inflammat Branch, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Freeman, Alexandra F.; Spalding, Christine; Elloumi, Houda Z.; Paulson, Michelle L.; Davis, Joie; Hsu, Amy; Holland, Steven M.] NIAID, Lab Clin Infect Dis, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Elias, Kevin M.] Vanderbilt Univ, Sch Med, Nashville, TN 37232 USA","Douek, DC (reprint author), NIAMSD, Human Immunol Sect, Vaccine Res Ctr, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA.",ddouek@nih.gov,"Laurence, Arian/A-8770-2009; Kanno, Yuka/B-5802-2013","Laurence, Arian/0000-0003-0942-8292; Kanno, Yuka/0000-0001-5668-9319; Elias, Kevin/0000-0003-1502-5553",Intramural NIH HHS [Z99 AI999999],,,30,635,656,2,30,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,10-Apr,2008,452,7188,,,,,773,U11,,10.1038/nature06764,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,285QY,WOS:000254792500050,18337720,No,Y,N,11/20/17

The distribution of pause lengths, with a median of 2.8 s, indicates that at least two rate- determining processes control each pause. Each translocation step measures three bases - one codon - and occurs in less than 0.1 s. Analysis of the times required for translocation reveals, surprisingly, that there are three substeps in each step. Pause lengths, and thus the overall rate of translation, depend on the secondary structure of the mRNA; the applied force destabilizes secondary structure and decreases pause durations, but does not affect translocation times. Translocation and RNA unwinding are strictly coupled ribosomal functions.","[Wen, Jin-Der; Bustamante, Carlos; Tinoco, Ignacio, Jr.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Chem, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Lancaster, Laura; Noller, Harry F.] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Mol Cell & Dev Biol, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA; [Lancaster, Laura; Noller, Harry F.] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Ctr Mol Biol RNA, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA; [Hodges, Courtney; Bustamante, Carlos] Univ Calif Berkeley, Biophys Grad Grp, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Zeri, Ana-Carolina] Brazilian Synchrotron Light Lab, BR-13083970 Campinas, SP, Brazil; [Yoshimura, Shige H.] Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Biostudies, Sakyo Ku, Kyoto 6068501, Japan; [Bustamante, Carlos] Univ Calif Berkeley, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Dept Phys & Mol & Cell Biol, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA","Tinoco, I (reprint author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Chem, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",intinoco@lbl.gov,,"Wen, Jin-Der/0000-0001-8317-4329; Hodges, Courtney/0000-0003-4441-497X; Bustamante, Carlos/0000-0002-2970-0073","NIGMS NIH HHS [R01 GM010840-49, R01 GM010840, R01 GM010840-50]",,,44,273,279,3,62,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,3-Apr,2008,452,7187,,,,,598,603,,10.1038/nature06716,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,282KR,WOS:000254567200038,18327250,No,Y,N,11/20/17

Improved knowledge of the molecular pathways controlling MDR in pathogenic fungi should facilitate the development of novel therapies to combat these intransigent infections. MDR is often caused by upregulation of drug efflux pumps by members of the fungal zinc- cluster transcription- factor family ( for example Pdr1p orthologues). However, the molecular mechanisms are poorly understood. Here we show that Pdr1p family members in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and the human pathogen Candida glabrata directly bind to structurally diverse drugs and xenobiotics, resulting in stimulated expression of drug efflux pumps and induction of MDR. Notably, this is mechanistically similar to regulation of MDR in vertebrates by the PXR nuclear receptor, revealing an unexpected functional analogy of fungal and metazoan regulators of MDR. We have also uncovered a critical and specific role of the Gal11p/ MED15 subunit of the Mediator co- activator and its activator- targeted KIX domain in antifungal/ xenobiotic- dependent regulation of MDR. This detailed mechanistic understanding of a fungal nuclear receptor- like gene regulatory pathway provides novel therapeutic targets for the treatment of multidrug- resistant fungal infections.","[Thakur, Jitendra K.; Yang, Fajun; Li, Darrick K.; Naar, Anders M.] Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Ctr Canc, Charlestown, MA 02129 USA; [Thakur, Jitendra K.; Yang, Fajun; Naar, Anders M.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Cell Biol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Arthanari, Haribabu; Fan, Xiaochun; Frueh, Dominique P.; Struhl, Kevin; Wagner, Gerhard] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Biol Chem & Mol Pharmacol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Pan, Shih-Jung; Cormack, Brendan P.] Johns Hopkins Univ, Sch Med, Dept Mol Biol & Genet, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA; [Breger, Julia; Mylonakis, Eleftherios] Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Div Infect Dis, Boston, MA 02114 USA; [Gulshan, Kailash; Moye-Rowley, W.

To find a 1- Earth-mass planet in an Earth- like orbit, a precision of similar to 5 cm s(-1) is necessary. The combination of a laser frequency comb with a Fabry-Perot filtering cavity has been suggested as a promising approach to achieve such Doppler shift resolution via improved spectrograph wavelength calibration(2-4), with recent encouraging results(5). Here we report the fabrication of such a filtered laser comb with up to 40-GHz ( similar to 1-angstrom ) line spacing, generated from a 1-GHz repetition- rate source, without compromising long- term stability, reproducibility or spectral resolution. This wide- linespacing comb, or 'astro- comb', is well matched to the resolving power of high- resolution astrophysical spectrographs.

Several experiments(2-4) have shown that in thin superconducting films, disorder enforces the droplet- like electronic texture - superconducting islands immersed into a normal matrix - and that tuning disorder drives the system from superconducting to insulating behaviour. In the vicinity of the transition, a distinct state(4) forms: a Cooper- pair insulator, with thermally activated conductivity. It results from synchronization of the phase of the superconducting order parameter at the islands across the whole system(5). Here we show that at a certain finite temperature, a Cooper- pair insulator undergoes a transition to a superinsulating state with infinite resistance. We present experimental evidence of this transition in titanium nitride films and show that the superinsulating state is dual to the superconducting state: it is destroyed by a sufficiently strong critical magnetic field, and breaks down at some critical voltage that is analogous to the critical current in superconductors.","[Vinokur, Valerii M.; Baturina, Tatyana I.] Argonne Natl Lab, Div Mat Sci, Argonne, IL 60439 USA; [Baturina, Tatyana I.; Mironov, Aleksey Yu.] Russian Acad Sci, Inst Semicond Phys, Novosibirsk 630090, Russia; [Baturina, Tatyana I.; Mironov, Aleksey Yu.; Strunk, Christoph] Univ Regensburg, Inst Expt Angew Phys, D-93040 Regensburg, Germany; [Fistul, Mikhail V.] Ruhr Univ Bochum, D-44801 Bochum, Germany; [Baklanov, Mikhail R.] IMEC, B-3001 Louvain, Belgium","Vinokur, VM (reprint author), Argonne Natl Lab, Div Mat Sci, 9700 S Cass Ave, Argonne, IL 60439 USA.",vinokour@anl.gov,"Mironov, Alexey/F-7555-2017; Vinokur, Valerii/J-7299-2013; Baklanov, Mikhail/D-4672-2016","Baklanov, Mikhail/0000-0002-1927-9561",,,,21,115,116,3,40,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,3-Apr,2008,452,7187,,,,,613,U5,,10.1038/nature06837,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,282KR,WOS:000254567200041,18385735,No,,,11/20/17

It has been suggested that production, transport and deposition of dust is influenced by climatic changes on glacial-interglacial timescales(3-6). Here we present a high- resolution record of aeolian dust from the EPICA Dome C ice core in East Antarctica, which provides an undisturbed climate sequence over the past eight climatic cycles(7,8). We find that there is a significant correlation between dust flux and temperature records during glacial periods that is absent during interglacial periods. Our data suggest that dust flux is increasingly correlated with Antarctic temperature as the climate becomes colder. We interpret this as progressive coupling of the climates of Antarctic and lower latitudes. Limited changes in glacial-interglacial atmospheric transport time(4,9,10) suggest that the sources and lifetime of dust are the main factors controlling the high glacial dust input. We propose that the observed similar to 25-fold increase in glacial dust flux over all eight glacial periods can be attributed to a strengthening of South American dust sources, together with a longer lifetime for atmospheric dust particles in the upper troposphere resulting from a reduced hydrological cycle during the ice ages.","[Petit, J.

In order to distinguish between these over the past 320 Myr ( since the formation of the Pangaea supercontinent), we present here computations of the global average of continental motion and rotation through time(4) in a palaeomagnetic reference frame. Two components are identified: a steady northward motion and, during certain time intervals, clockwise and anticlockwise rotations, interpreted as evidence for true polar wander. We find 186 anti-clockwise rotation about 250-220 Myr ago and the same amount of clockwise rotation about 195-145 Myr ago. In both cases the rotation axis is located at about 10-20 degrees W, 0 degrees N, near the site that became the North American - South American - African triple junction at the break- up of Pangaea. This was followed by 106 clockwise rotation about 145-135 Myr ago, followed again by the same amount of anticlockwise rotation about 110-100 Myr ago, with a rotation axis in both cases similar to 25-50 degrees E in the reconstructed area of North Africa and Arabia. These rotation axes mark the maxima of the degree- two non- hydrostatic geoid during those time intervals, and the fact that the overall net rotation since 320 Myr ago is nearly zero is an indication of long- term stability of the degree- two geoid and related mantle structure(5,6). We propose a new reference frame, based on palaeomagnetism, but corrected for the true polar wander identified in this study, appropriate for relating surface to deep mantle processes from 320 Myr ago until hotspot tracks can be used ( about 130 Myr ago).","[Steinberger, Bernhard; Torsvik, Trond H.] Geol Survey Norway, Ctr Geodynam, N-7491 Trondheim, Norway; [Torsvik, Trond H.] Univ Oslo, N-0316 Oslo, Norway; [Torsvik, Trond H.] Univ Witwatersrand, Sch Geosci, ZA-2050 Wits, South Africa","Steinberger, B (reprint author), Geol Survey Norway, Ctr Geodynam, Leiv Eirikssons Vei 39, N-7491 Trondheim, Norway.",bernhard.steinberger@ngu.no,,,,,,32,116,118,5,31,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,3-Apr,2008,452,7187,,,,,620,U6,,10.1038/nature06824,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,282KR,WOS:000254567200043,18385737,No,,,11/20/17

Although microsporidia have long been considered as early branching eukaryotes that lack mitochondria(4), they have recently been shown to contain a tiny mitochondrial remnant called a mitosome(2,5). The function of the mitosome is unknown, because microsporidians lack the genes for canonical mitochondrial functions, such as aerobic respiration and haem biosynthesis. However, microsporidial genomes encode several components of the mitochondrial iron - sulphur ( Fe - S) cluster assembly machinery. Here we provide experimental insights into the metabolic function and localization of these proteins. We cloned, functionally characterized and localized homologues of several central mitochondrial Fe - S cluster assembly components for the microsporidians Encephalitozoon cuniculi and Trachipleistophora hominis. Several microsporidial proteins can functionally replace their yeast counterparts in Fe - S protein biogenesis. In E. cuniculi, the iron ( frataxin) and sulphur ( cysteine desulphurase, Nfs1) donors and the scaffold protein ( Isu1) co- localize with mitochondrial Hsp70 to the mitosome, consistent with it being the functional site for Fe - S cluster biosynthesis. In T. hominis, mitochondrial Hsp70 and the essential sulphur donor ( Nfs1) are still in the mitosome, but surprisingly the main pools of Isu1 and frataxin are cytosolic, creating a conundrum of how these key components of Fe - S cluster biosynthesis coordinate their function. Together, our studies identify the essential biosynthetic process of Fe - S protein assembly as a key function of microsporidian mitosomes.","[Goldberg, Alina V.; Hirt, Robert P.; Embley, T.

Determining the metabolic processes performed by microbes is important both for understanding and for manipulating ecosystems ( for example, disruption of key processes that lead to disease, conservation of environmental services, and so on). Describing microbial function is hampered by the inability to culture most microbes and by high levels of genomic plasticity. Metagenomic approaches analyse microbial communities to determine the metabolic processes that are important for growth and survival in any given environment. Here we conduct a metagenomic comparison of almost 15 million sequences from 45 distinct microbiomes and, for the first time, 42 distinct viromes and show that there are strongly discriminatory metabolic profiles across environments. Most of the functional diversity was maintained in all of the communities, but the relative occurrence of metabolisms varied, and the differences between metagenomes predicted the biogeochemical conditions of each environment. The magnitude of the microbial metabolic capabilities encoded by the viromes was extensive, suggesting that they serve as a repository for storing and sharing genes among their microbial hosts and influence global evolutionary and metabolic processes.","[Dinsdale, Elizabeth A.; Edwards, Robert A.; Hall, Dana; Angly, Florent; Furlan, Mike; Desnues, Christelle; Haynes, Matthew; Li, Linlin; Brito, Beltran Rodriguez; Thurber, Rebecca Vega; Wegley, Linda; Rohwer, Forest] San Diego State Univ, Dept Biol, San Diego, CA 92182 USA; [Edwards, Robert A.; Rohwer, Forest] San Diego State Univ, Ctr Microbial Sci, San Diego, CA 92182 USA; [Edwards, Robert A.] San Diego State Univ, Dept Comp Sci, San Diego, CA 92182 USA; [Angly, Florent; Brito, Beltran Rodriguez] San Diego State Univ, Computat Sci Res Ctr, San Diego, CA 92182 USA; [Dinsdale, Elizabeth A.] Flinders Univ S Australia, Sch Biol Sci, Bedford Pk, SA 5042, Australia; [Edwards, Robert A.; Olson, Robert; Stevens, Rick] Argonne Natl Lab, Div Math & Comp Sci, Argonne, IL 60439 USA; [Breitbart, Mya; McDaniel, Lauren; Paul, John] Univ S Florida, Coll Marine Sci, St Petersburg, FL 33701 USA; [Brulc, Jennifer M.; White, Bryan A.] Univ Illinois, Dept Anim Sci, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [White, Bryan A.] Univ Illinois, Inst Genom Biol, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Moran, Mary Ann] Univ Georgia, Dept Marine Sci, Athens, GA 30602 USA; [Nelson, Karen E.] J Craig Venter Inst, Rockville, MD 20850 USA; [Nilsson, Christina; Ruan, Yijun] Genome Inst Singapore, Singapore 138672, Singapore; [Swan, Brandon K.; Valentine, David L.] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Earth Sci, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA","Dinsdale, EA (reprint author), San Diego State Univ, Dept Biol, San Diego, CA 92182 USA.",elizabeth_dinsdale@hotmail.com,"Breitbart, Mya/B-1366-2009; Li, Linlin/E-3335-2010; Angly, Florent/A-7717-2011; Moran, Mary Ann/B-6939-2012; Valentine, David/E-5594-2012; Desnues, Christelle/B-1383-2010","Breitbart, Mya/0000-0003-3210-2899; Angly, Florent/0000-0002-8999-0738; Desnues, Christelle/0000-0002-2178-0355; Valentine, David/0000-0001-5914-9107; Swan, Brandon/0000-0003-0465-1444; Moran, Mary Ann/0000-0002-0702-8167",,,,36,495,507,11,211,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,3-Apr,2008,452,7187,,,,,629,U8,,10.1038/nature06810,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,282KR,WOS:000254567200045,18337718,No,Y,N,11/20/17

To identify genetic factors that modify disease risk, we conducted a genome- wide association study by analysing 317,139 single- nucleotide polymorphisms in 1,989 lung cancer cases and 2,625 controls from six central European countries. We identified a locus in chromosome region 15q25 that was strongly associated with lung cancer ( P= 9 x 10(-10)). This locus was replicated in five separate lung cancer studies comprising an additional 2,513 lung cancer cases and 4,752 controls ( P = 5 x 10(-20) overall), and it was found to account for 14%( attributable risk) of lung cancer cases. Statistically similar risks were observed irrespective of smoking status or propensity to smoke tobacco. The association region contains several genes, including three that encode nicotinic acetylcholine receptor subunits ( CHRNA5, CHRNA3 and CHRNB4). Such subunits are expressed in neurons and other tissues, in particular alveolar epithelial cells, pulmonary neuroendocrine cells and lung cancer cell lines(2,3), and they bind to N'- nitrosonornicotine and potential lung carcinogens(4). A non- synonymous variant of CHRNA5 that induces an amino acid substitution ( D398N) at a highly conserved site in the second intracellular loop of the protein is among the markers with the strongest disease associations. Our results provide compelling evidence of a locus at 15q25 predisposing to lung cancer, and reinforce interest in nicotinic acetylcholine receptors as potential disease candidates and chemopreventative targets(5).","[Hung, Rayjean J.; Mckay, James D.; Gaborieau, Valerie; Boffetta, Paolo; Hashibe, Mia; Hainaut, Pierre; Brennan, Paul] IARC, F-69008 Lyon, France; [Hung, Rayjean J.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Sch Publ Hlth, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Zaridze, David; Mukeria, Anush] Canc Res Ctr, Inst Carcinogenesis, Moscow 115478, Russia; [Szeszenia-Dabrowska, Neonilia] Inst Occupat Med, Dept Epidemiol, PL-90950 Lodz, Poland; [Lissowska, Jolanta] M Sklodowska Curie Mem Canc Ctr & Inst Oncol, PL-02781 Warsaw, Poland; [Rudnai, Peter] Natl Inst Environm Hlth, H-1097 Budapest, Hungary; [Fabianova, Eleonora] Specialized Inst Hyg & Epidemiol, Banska Bystrica 97556, Slovakia; [Mates, Dana] Inst Publ Hlth, Bucharest 050463, Romania; [Bencko, Vladimir] Charles Univ Prague, Fac Med 1, Inst Hyg & Epidemiol, Prague 12800 2, Czech Republic; [Foretova, Lenka] Masaryk Mem Canc Inst, Dept Canc Epidemiol & Genet, Brno 65653, Czech Republic; [Janout, Vladimir] Palacky Univ, Olomouc 77515, Czech Republic; [Chen, Chu; Goodman, Gary] Fred Hutchinson Canc Res Ctr, Seattle, WA 98109 USA; [Field, John K.; Liloglou, Triantafillos; Xinarianos, George; Cassidy, Adrian] Univ Liverpool, Canc Res Ctr, Roy Castle Lung Canc Res Programme, Liverpool L3 9TA, Merseyside, England; [McLaughlin, John] Canc Care Ontario, Toronto, ON M5G 2L7, Canada; [McLaughlin, John] Samuel Lunenfeld Res Inst, Toronto, ON M5G 2L7, Canada; [Liu, Geoffrey] Princess Margaret Hosp, Ontario Canc Inst, Toronto, ON M5G 2M9, Canada; [Narod, Steven] Womens Coll Res Inst, Toronto, ON M5G 1N8, Canada; [Krokan, Hans E.; Skorpen, Frank; Elvestad, Maiken Bratt; Hveem, Kristian; Vatten, Lars] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, N-7489 Trondheim, Norway; [Linseisen, Jakob] German Canc Res Ctr, Div Canc Epidemiol, D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany; [Clavel-Chapelon, Francoise] Inst Gustave Roussy, INSERM, ER120, F-94805 Villejuif, France; [Vineis, Paolo; Riboli, Elio] Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Dept Epidemiol & Publ Hlth, London W2 1PG, England; [Vineis, Paolo] ISI, I-10133 Turin, Italy; [Bueno-de-Mesquita, H.

Evidence for genetic influence on smoking behaviour and nicotine dependence (ND)(3-8) has prompted a search for susceptibility genes. Furthermore, assessing the impact of sequence variants on smoking-related diseases is important to public health(9,10). Smoking is the major risk factor for lung cancer (LC)(11-14) and is one of the main risk factors for peripheral arterial disease (PAD)(15-17). Here we identify a common variant in the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor gene cluster on chromosome 15q24 with an effect on smoking quantity, ND and the risk of two smoking- related diseases in populations of European descent. The variant has an effect on the number of cigarettes smoked per day in our sample of smokers. The same variant was associated with ND in a previous genomewide association study that used low- quantity smokers as controls(18,19), and with a similar approach we observe a highly significant association with ND. A comparison of cases of LC and PAD with population controls each showed that the variant confers risk of LC and PAD. The findings provide a case study of a gene - environment interaction(20), highlighting the role of nicotine addiction in the pathology of other serious diseases.","[Thorgeirsson, Thorgeir E.; Geller, Frank; Sulem, Patrick; Rafnar, Thorunn; Wiste, Anna; Magnusson, Kristinn P.; Manolescu, Andrei; Thorleifsson, Gudmar; Stefansson, Hreinn; Ingason, Andres; Stacey, Simon N.; Bergthorsson, Jon T.; Thorlacius, Steinunn; Gudmundsson, Julius; Jonsson, Thorlakur; Jakobsdottir, Margret; Saemundsdottir, Jona; Olafsdottir, Olof; Gudmundsson, Larus J.; Bjornsdottir, Gyda; Kristjansson, Kristleifur; Gudbjartsson, Daniel F.; Gulcher, Jeffrey R.; Thorsteinsdottir, Unnur; Kong, Augustine; Stefansson, Kari] deCODE Genet, IS-101 Reykjavik, Iceland; [Wiste, Anna] Emory Univ, Dept Psychiat & Behav Sci, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA; [Skuladottir, Halla] Landspital Univ Hosp, Dept Med Oncol, IS-101 Reykjavik, Iceland; [Isaksson, Helgi J.] Landspital Univ Hosp, Dept Pathol, IS-101 Reykjavik, Iceland; [Gudbjartsson, Tomas] Landspital Univ Hosp, Dept Cardiothorac Surg, IS-101 Reykjavik, Iceland; [Kolbeinsson, Halldor; Stefansson, Jon G.] Landspital Univ Hosp, Dept Gen Adult Psychiat, IS-101 Reykjavik, Iceland; [Jonsson, Steinn] Landspital Univ Hosp, Dept Med, IS-101 Reykjavik, Iceland; [Jones, Gregory T.; van Rij, Andre M.] Univ Otago, Dept Surg, Dunedin Sch Med, Dunedin 9054, New Zealand; [Mueller, Thomas; Dieplinger, Benjamin; Haltmayer, Meinhard] Konventhosp Barmherzige Brueder, Dept Lab Med, A-4020 Linz, Austria; [Gottsater, Anders; Lindblad, Bengt] Malmo Univ Hosp, MAS, Ctr Vasc Dis, S-20502 Malmo, Sweden; [Flex, Andrea; Pola, Roberto] Univ Cattolica Sacro Cuore, Sch Med, Lab Vasc Biol & Genet, A Gemelli Univ Hosp, I-00168 Rome, Italy; [Aben, Katja K.

The brain makes use of multiple visual cues to reconstruct the three- dimensional structure of a scene. One potent cue, motion parallax, frequently arises during translation of the observer because the images of objects at different distances move across the retina with different velocities. Human psychophysical studies have demonstrated that motion parallax can be a powerful depth cue(1-5), and motion parallax seems to be heavily exploited by animal species that lack highly developed binocular vision(6-8). However, little is known about the neural mechanisms that underlie this capacity. Here we show, by using a virtual- reality system to translate macaque monkeys ( Macaca mulatta) while they viewed motion parallax displays that simulated objects at different depths, that many neurons in the middle temporal area ( area MT) signal the sign of depth ( near versus far) from motion parallax in the absence of other depth cues. To achieve this, neurons must combine visual motion with extra- retinal ( non- visual) signals related to the animal's movement. Our findings suggest a new neural substrate for depth perception and demonstrate a robust interaction of visual and non- visual cues in area MT. Combined with previous studies that implicate area MT in depth perception based on binocular disparities(9-12), our results suggest that area MT contains a more general representation of three- dimensional space that makes use of multiple cues.","[Nadler, Jacob W.; Angelaki, Dora E.; DeAngelis, Gregory C.] Washington Univ, Sch Med, Dept Anat & Neurobiol, St Louis, MO 63110 USA; [DeAngelis, Gregory C.] Univ Rochester, Dept Brain & Cognit Sci, Rochester, NY 14627 USA","DeAngelis, GC (reprint author), Washington Univ, Sch Med, Dept Anat & Neurobiol, St Louis, MO 63110 USA.",gdeangelis@cvs.rochester.edu,,,"NEI NIH HHS [R01 EY013644, R01 EY013644-07, R01 EY017866, R01 EY017866-02, T32 EY013360]",,,30,54,54,0,18,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,3-Apr,2008,452,7187,,,,,642,U10,,10.1038/nature06814,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,282KR,WOS:000254567200048,18344979,No,,,11/20/17

Here we show that blocking phosphorylation of the AKT substrate, endothelial nitric oxide synthase ( eNOS or NOS3), inhibits tumour initiation and maintenance. Moreover, eNOS enhances the nitrosylation and activation of endogenous wild- type Ras proteins, which are required throughout tumorigenesis. We suggest that activation of the PI3K - AKT - eNOS -( wild- type) Ras pathway by oncogenic Ras in cancer cells is required to initiate and maintain tumour growth.","[Lim, Kian-Huat; Ancrile, Brooke B.; Kashatus, David F.; Counter, Christopher M.] Duke Univ, Med Ctr, Dept Pharmacol & Canc Biol, Dept Radiat Oncol, Durham, NC 27710 USA","Counter, CM (reprint author), Duke Univ, Med Ctr, Dept Pharmacol & Canc Biol, Dept Radiat Oncol, Durham, NC 27710 USA.",count004@mc.duke.edu,"Kashatus, David/D-8299-2012","Kashatus, David/0000-0001-8007-0612; Lim, Kian-Huat/0000-0002-2766-200X","NCI NIH HHS [R01 CA094184-01, R01 CA094184-02, R01 CA094184-03, R01 CA094184-04, R01 CA094184, R01 CA094184-05, R01 CA123031, R01 CA123031-01A2]",,,34,159,165,0,7,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,3-Apr,2008,452,7187,,,,,646,U11,,10.1038/nature06778,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,282KR,WOS:000254567200049,18344980,No,,,11/20/17

Similarly, epithelial tumour maintenance relies on cancer stem cells ( CSCs), which co-opt stem cell properties(2). For most tumours, the cellular origin of these CSCs and regulatory pathways essential for sustaining stemness have not been identified. In murine skin, follicular morphogenesis is driven by bulge stem cells that specifically express CD34. Here we identify a population of cells in early epidermal tumours characterized by phenotypic and functional similarities to normal bulge skin stem cells. This population contains CSCs, which are the only cells with tumour initiation properties. Transplants derived from these CSCs preserve the hierarchical organization of the primary tumour. We describe beta-catenin signalling(3) as being essential in sustaining the CSC phenotype. Ablation of the beta-catenin gene results in the loss of CSCs and complete tumour regression. In addition, we provide evidence for the involvement of increased beta-catenin signalling in malignant human squamous cell carcinomas. Because Wnt/beta-catenin signalling is not essential for normal epidermal homeostasis, such a mechanistic difference may thus be targeted to eliminate CSCs(4) and consequently eradicate squamous cell carcinomas.","[Malanchi, Ilaria; Kassen, Deepika; Hussenet, Thomas; Huelsken, Joerg] EPFL, ISREC Swiss Inst Expt Canc Res, CH-1066 Epalinges, Switzerland; [Malanchi, Ilaria; Kassen, Deepika; Hussenet, Thomas; Huelsken, Joerg] NCCR Mol Oncol, CH-1066 Epalinges, Switzerland; [Peinado, Hector; Cano, Amparo] UAM, CSIC, Dept Bioquim, Inst Invest Biomed Alberto Sols, Madrid 28029, Spain; [Metzger, Daniel; Chambon, Pierre] CU Strasbourg, IGBMC, F-67404 Illkirch Graffenstaden, France; [Huber, Marcel; Hohl, Daniel] CHU Vaudois, Lab Cutaneous Biol Dermatol, CH-1011 Lausanne, Switzerland; [Huber, Marcel; Hohl, Daniel] FBM UNIL, CH-1011 Lausanne, Switzerland; [Birchmeier, Walter] Max Delbruck Ctr Mol Med, D-13122 Berlin, Germany","Huelsken, J (reprint author), EPFL, ISREC Swiss Inst Expt Canc Res, Chemin Boveresses 155, CH-1066 Epalinges, Switzerland.",joerg.huelsken@epfl.ch,"Peinado, Hector/A-6417-2013","Metzger, Daniel/0000-0002-5555-046X; Peinado, Hector/0000-0002-4256-3413",,,,32,355,381,3,35,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,3-Apr,2008,452,7187,,,,,650,U12,,10.1038/nature06835,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,282KR,WOS:000254567200050,18385740,No,,,11/20/17

Coagulation initiated by the cytokine- receptor family member known as tissue factor is a hallmark of systemic inflammatory response syndromes in bacterial sepsis and viral haemorrhagic fevers(1,2), and anticoagulants can be effective in severe sepsis with disseminated intravascular coagulation(3). The precise mechanism coupling coagulation and inflammation remains unresolved(4-7). Here we show that protease- activated receptor 1 ( PAR1) signalling sustains a lethal inflammatory response that can be interrupted by inhibition of either thrombin or PAR1 signalling. The sphingosine 1- phosphate ( S1P) axis is a downstream component of PAR1 signalling, and by combining chemical and genetic probes for S1P receptor 3 ( S1P3) we show a critical role for dendritic cell PAR1 - S1P3 cross- talk in regulating amplification of inflammation in sepsis syndrome. Conversely, dendritic cells sustain escalated systemic coagulation and are the primary hub at which coagulation and inflammation intersect within the lymphatic compartment. Loss of dendritic cell PAR1 - S1P3 signalling sequesters dendritic cells and inflammation into draining lymph nodes, and attenuates dissemination of interleukin-1 beta to the lungs. Thus, activation of dendritic cells by coagulation in the lymphatics emerges as a previously unknown mechanism that promotes systemic inflammation and lethality in decompensated innate immune responses.","[Niessen, Frank; Schaffner, Florence; Furlan-Freguia, Christian; Pawlinski, Rafal; Bhattacharjee, Gourab; Rosen, Hugh; Ruf, Wolfram] Scripps Res Inst, Dept Immunol, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; [Chun, Jerold] Scripps Res Inst, Dept Mol Biol, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; [Rosen, Hugh] Scripps Res Inst, Dept Physiol Chem, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; [Derian, Claudia K.; Andrade-Gordon, Patricia] Johnson & Johnson PRD, Spring House, PA 19477 USA","Ruf, W (reprint author), Scripps Res Inst, Dept Immunol, 10666 N Torrey Pines Rd, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA.",ruf@scripps.edu,,,,,,30,185,192,0,7,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,3-Apr,2008,452,7187,,,,,654,658,,10.1038/nature06663,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,282KR,WOS:000254567200051,18305483,No,,,11/20/17

Therefore, a more integrative biology approach is needed to unravel the complexity and causes of such diseases. To elucidate the complexity of common human diseases such as obesity, we have analysed the expression of 23,720 transcripts in large population- based blood and adipose tissue cohorts comprehensively assessed for various phenotypes, including traits related to clinical obesity. In contrast to the blood expression profiles, we observed a marked correlation between gene expression in adipose tissue and obesity- related traits. Genome- wide linkage and association mapping revealed a highly significant genetic component to gene expression traits, including a strong genetic effect of proximal ( cis) signals, with 50% of the cis signals overlapping between the two tissues profiled. Here we demonstrate an extensive transcriptional network constructed from the human adipose data that exhibits significant overlap with similar network modules constructed from mouse adipose data. A core network module in humans and mice was identified that is enriched for genes involved in the inflammatory and immune response and has been found to be causally associated to obesity- related traits.","[Emilsson, Valur; Thorleifsson, Gudmar; Zink, Florian; Helgason, Agnar; Walters, G.

However, identification of disease- susceptibility genes by means of such studies provides limited functional information on how genes lead to disease. In fact, in most cases there is an absence of functional information altogether, preventing a definitive identification of the susceptibility gene or genes. Here we develop an alternative to the classic forward genetics approach for dissecting complex disease traits where, instead of identifying susceptibility genes directly affected by variations in DNA, we identify gene networks that are perturbed by susceptibility loci and that in turn lead to disease. Application of this method to liver and adipose gene expression data generated from a segregating mouse population results in the identification of a macrophage- enriched network supported as having a causal relationship with disease traits associated with metabolic syndrome. Three genes in this network, lipoprotein lipase ( Lpl), lactamase beta ( Lactb) and protein phosphatase 1- like ( Ppm1l), are validated as previously unknown obesity genes, strengthening the association between this network and metabolic disease traits. Our analysis provides direct experimental support that complex traits such as obesity are emergent properties of molecular networks that are modulated by complex genetic loci and environmental factors.","[Chen, Yanqing; Zhu, Jun; Lum, Pek Yee; Yang, Xia; Zhang, Chunsheng; Lamb, John; Edwards, Stephen; Sieberts, Solveig K.; Leonardson, Amy; Zhang, Bin; Emilsson, Valur; Schadt, Eric E.] Merck & Co Inc, Rosetta Inpharmat LLC, Seattle, WA 98109 USA; [Pinto, Shirly; MacNeil, Douglas J.] Merck & Co Inc, Dept Metab Disorders, Rahway, NJ 07065 USA; [Castellini, Lawrence W.; Wang, Susanna; Doss, Sudheer; Ghazalpour, Anatole; Lusis, Aldons J.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Microbiol Mol Genet & Immunol, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Horvath, Steve; Lusis, Aldons J.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Human Genet, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Drake, Thomas A.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Pathol & Lab Med, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Champy, Marie-France] ULP, CNRS, INSERM, Inst Genet & Biol Mol & Cellulaire, F-67404 Illkirch Graffenstaden, France","Schadt, EE (reprint author), Merck & Co Inc, Rosetta Inpharmat LLC, 401 Terry Ave N, Seattle, WA 98109 USA.",eric_schadt@merck.com,"Chen, Yanqing/B-5614-2009","MacNeil, Doug/0000-0001-7089-0668","NHLBI NIH HHS [P01 HL028481, P01 HL028481-24, P01 HL028481-240010, P01 HL030568, P01 HL030568-250011]; NIDDK NIH HHS [R01 DK071673, R01 DK071673-03]",,,50,547,567,4,37,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,27-Mar,2008,452,7186,,,,,429,435,,10.1038/nature06757,,7,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,279FU,WOS:000254341300023,18344982,No,Y,N,11/20/17

Local dendritic spikes are nonlinear voltage events that are initiated within dendritic branches by spatially clustered and temporally synchronous synaptic input. That local spikes selectively respond only to appropriately correlated input allows them to function as input feature detectors and potentially as powerful information storage mechanisms. However, it is currently unknown whether any effective form of local dendritic spike plasticity exists. Here we show that the coupling between local dendritic spikes and the soma of rat hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons can be modified in a branch- specific manner through an N- methyl- D- aspartate receptor ( NMDAR)- dependent regulation of dendritic Kv4.2 potassium channels. These data suggest that compartmentalized changes in branch excitability could store multiple complex features of synaptic input, such as their spatio- temporal correlation.

Circadian oscillations are markedly altered when mice are subjected to continuous light or to a 'jet lag' ( defined as a shift of 12 h). Circulating HSCs and their progenitors fluctuate in antiphase with the expression of the chemokine CXCL12 in the bone marrow microenvironment. The cyclical release of HSCs and expression of Cxcl12 are regulated by core genes of the molecular clock through circadian noradrenaline secretion by the sympathetic nervous system. These adrenergic signals are locally delivered by nerves in the bone marrow, transmitted to stromal cells by the beta(3)- adrenergic receptor, leading to a decreased nuclear content of Sp1 transcription factor and the rapid downregulation of Cxcl12.

In non- relativistic quantum mechanics, these are independent, resulting in large degeneracies in atomic spectra. However, relativistic effects couple the spin and orbital motion, leading to the well- known fine structure in their spectra. The electronic states in defect- free carbon nanotubes are widely believed to be four- fold degenerate(1-10), owing to independent spin and orbital symmetries, and also to possess electron - hole symmetry(11). Here we report measurements demonstrating that in clean nanotubes the spin and orbital motion of electrons are coupled, thereby breaking all of these symmetries. This spin - orbit coupling is directly observed as a splitting of the four- fold degeneracy of a single electron in ultra- clean quantum dots. The coupling favours parallel alignment of the orbital and spin magnetic moments for electrons and antiparallel alignment for holes. Our measurements are consistent with recent theories(12,13) that predict the existence of spin - orbit coupling in curved graphene and describe it as a spin-dependent topological phase in nanotubes. Our findings have important implications for spin- based applications in carbon-based systems, entailing new design principles for the realization of quantum bits ( qubits) in nanotubes and providing a mechanism for all- electrical control of spins(14) in nanotubes.","[Kuemmeth, F.; Ilani, S.; Ralph, D.

Several important carbon carbon bond- forming reactions, including the Mannich reaction, have been developed using this approach(2), all of which are useful for making chiral, biologically relevant compounds. Remarkably, despite attempts(3,4), the simplest of all nucleophiles, acetaldehyde, could not be used in this way.

The oxidation state of the Proterozoic ocean between these two steps and the timing of deep- ocean oxygenation have important implications for the evolutionary course of life on Earth but remain poorly known. Here we present a new perspective on ocean oxygenation based on the authigenic accumulation of the redox- sensitive transition element molybdenum in sulphidic black shales. Accumulation of authigenic molybdenum from sea water is already seen in shales by 2,650 Myr ago; however, the small magnitudes of these enrichments reflect weak or transient(7) sources of dissolved molybdenum before about 2,200 Myr ago, consistent with minimal oxidative weathering of the continents. Enrichments indicative of persistent and vigorous oxidative weathering appear in shales deposited at roughly 2,150 Myr ago, more than 200 million years after the initial rise in atmospheric oxygen(1,2). Subsequent expansion of sulphidic conditions after about 1,800 Myr ago ( refs 8, 9) maintained a mid- Proterozoic molybdenum reservoir below 20 per cent of the modern inventory, which in turn may have acted as a nutrient feedback limiting the spatiotemporal distribution of euxinic ( sulphidic) bottom waters and perhaps the evolutionary and ecological expansion of eukaryotic organisms(10). By 551 Myr ago, molybdenum contents reflect a greatly expanded oceanic reservoir due to oxygenation of the deep ocean and corresponding decrease in sulphidic conditions in the sediments and water column.","[Scott, C.; Lyons, T.

The total melt volume, however, is uncertain, because only part of it has erupted at the surface. Furthermore, the cause of the magmatism is still disputed - specifically, whether or not it is due to increased mantle temperatures. We recorded deep- penetration normal-incidence and wide- angle seismic profiles across the Faroe and Hatton Bank volcanic margins in the northeast Atlantic. Here we show that near the Faroe Islands, for every 1 km along strike, 360 - 400 km(3) of basalt is extruded, while 540 - 600 km(3) is intruded into the continent - ocean transition. We find that lower- crustal intrusions are focused mainly into a narrow zone similar to 50 km wide on the transition, although extruded basalts flow more than 100 km from the rift. Seismic profiles show that the melt is intruded into the lower crust as sills, which cross- cut the continental fabric, rather than as an 'underplate' of 100 per cent melt, as has often been assumed. Evidence from the measured seismic velocities and from igneous thicknesses are consistent with the dominant control on melt production being increased mantle temperatures, with no requirement for either significant active small- scale mantle convection under the rift or the presence of fertile mantle at the time of continental break- up, as has previously been suggested for the North Atlantic Ocean(4-6).","[White, R.

However, the purportedly oldest of the Early Pleistocene sites in Eurasia lack precise age control and contain stone tools rather than human fossil remains(1-5). Here we report the discovery of a human mandible associated with an assemblage of Mode 1 lithic tools and faunal remains bearing traces of hominin processing, in stratigraphic level TE9 at the site of the Sima del Elefante, Atapuerca, Spain(6-8). Level TE9 has been dated to the Early Pleistocene ( approximately 1.2 - 1.1 Myr), based on a combination of palaeomagnetism, cosmogenic nuclides and biostratigraphy. The Sima del Elefante site thus emerges as the oldest, most accurately dated record of human occupation in Europe, to our knowledge. The study of the human mandible suggests that the first settlement of Western Europe could be related to an early demographic expansion out of Africa. The new evidence, with previous findings in other Atapuerca sites ( level TD6 from Gran Dolina(9-13)), also suggests that a speciation event occurred in this extreme area of the Eurasian continent during the Early Pleistocene, initiating the hominin lineage represented by the TE9 and TD6 hominins.","[Carbonell, Eudald; Olle, Andreu; Mosquera, Marina; Huguet, Rosa; Sala, Robert; Vallverdu, Josep; Rodriguez, Xose P.; Verges, Josep M.; Allue, Ethel; Burjachs, Francesc; Caceres, Isabel; Canals, Antoni; Lozano, Marina; Rosell, Jordi] Univ Rovira & Virgili, Inst Catala Paleoecol Humana & Evoluc Social, Area Prehistoria, Tarragona 43005, Spain; [Bermudez de Castro, Jose M.; Pares, Josep M.; Perez-Gonzalez, Alfredo; Martinon-Torres, Maria; Mateos, Ana; Rodriguez, Jesus] Ctr Nacl Invest Evoluc Humana, Burgos 09004, Spain; [Pares, Josep M.; Stock, Greg M.] Univ Michigan, Dept Geol Sci, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Perez-Gonzalez, Alfredo; Benito, Alfonso] Univ Complutense Madrid, Dept Geodinam, Fac Ciencias Geol, E-28040 Madrid, Spain; [Cuenca-Bescos, Gloria] Univ Zaragoza, Fac Ciencias, Area Paleontol, E-50009 Zaragoza, Spain; [van der Made, Jan; Rosas, Antonio] CSIC, Museo Nacl Ciencias Nat, Dept Paleobiol, E-28006 Madrid, Spain; [Garcia, Nuria; Arsuaga, Juan L.] Univ Complutense Madrid, Dept Paleontol, Fac Ciencias Geol, E-28040 Madrid, Spain; [Garcia, Nuria; Arsuaga, Juan L.] UCM, ISCII Evoluc & Comportamiento Humanos, Ctr Invest, Madrid 28029, Spain; [Granger, Darryl E.] Purdue Univ, Dept Earth & Atmospher Sci, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA; [Stock, Greg M.] Yosemite Natl Pk, El Portal, CA 95318 USA; [Burjachs, Francesc] Inst Catalana Recerca & Estud Avancats, Tarragona 43005, Spain; [Diez, Carlos; Navazo, Marta] Univ Burgos, Lab Prehistoria, Burgos 09001, Spain","Carbonell, E (reprint author), Univ Rovira & Virgili, Inst Catala Paleoecol Humana & Evoluc Social, Area Prehistoria, Placa Imperial Tarraco 1, Tarragona 43005, Spain.",eudald.carbonell@urv.cat; jm.ber@cenieh.es,"; Rosas, Antonio/D-9742-2016; Olle, Andreu/D-6837-2013; Mosquera, Marina/B-1140-2014; Caceres, Isabel/G-2636-2015; RODRIGUEZ, XOSE-PEDRO/A-1069-2008; dez, carlos/B-2126-2008; Rodriguez-Alvarez, Xose-Pedro/B-9057-2009; Gloria, Cuenca-Bescos/A-3616-2013; Canals Salomo, Antoni/D-3395-2014; Sala Ramos,  Robert/L-5674-2014; Burjachs, Francesc/G-2064-2015; Carbonell, Eudald/G-3003-2015; Benito-Calvo, Alfonso/G-3897-2015; Verges Bosch, Josep Maria/G-4490-2015; Lozano, Marina/G-7293-2015","Martinon-Torres, Maria/0000-0002-2750-4554; Rosell, Jordi/0000-0002-6758-6291; van der Made, Jan/0000-0002-4807-4338; Rosas, Antonio/0000-0002-5829-9952; Olle, Andreu/0000-0002-8643-5536; Mosquera, Marina/0000-0003-4823-6154; Navazo, Marta/0000-0002-3602-2741; Vallverdu i Poch, Josep/0000-0002-3177-3263; diez, j.carlos/0000-0002-3856-1837; Rodriguez, Jesus/0000-0002-2834-0694; Caceres, Isabel/0000-0001-8487-2591; Rodriguez-Alvarez, Xose-Pedro/0000-0002-1852-2283; Gloria, Cuenca-Bescos/0000-0001-5125-9651; Canals Salomo, Antoni/0000-0002-4240-0921; Sala Ramos,  Robert/0000-0002-7168-824X; Burjachs, Francesc/0000-0002-7200-9552; Benito-Calvo, Alfonso/0000-0002-6363-1753; Verges Bosch, Josep Maria/0000-0003-1807-7463; Lozano, Marina/0000-0002-6304-7848",ICREA,,,52,330,343,2,111,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,27-Mar,2008,452,7186,,,,,465,U7,,10.1038/nature06815,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,279FU,WOS:000254341300030,18368116,No,Y,N,11/20/17

Typically, mutations simultaneously affect multiple phenotypic characters. This phenomenon is known as pleiotropy. The impact of pleiotropy on evolution has for decades been the subject of formal analysis(1-6). Some authors have suggested that pleiotropy can impede evolutionary progress ( a so- called 'cost of complexity'(5)). The plausibility of various phenomena attributed to pleiotropy depends on how many traits are affected by each mutation and on our understanding of the correlation between the number of traits affected by each gene substitution and the size of mutational effects on individual traits. Here we show, by studying pleiotropy in mice with the use of quantitative trait loci ( QTLs) affecting skeletal characters, that most QTLs affect a relatively small subset of traits and that a substitution at a QTL has an effect on each trait that increases with the total number of traits affected. This suggests that evolution of higher organisms does not suffer a 'cost of complexity' because most mutations affect few traits and the size of the effects does not decrease with pleiotropy.","[Wagner, Gunter P.] Yale Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolut Biol, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Kenney-Hunt, Jane P.; Pavlicev, Mihaela; Cheverud, James M.] Washington Univ, Dept Anat & Neurobiol, St Louis, MO 63110 USA; [Peck, Joel R.; Waxman, David] Univ Sussex, Sch Life Sci, Ctr Study Evolut, Brighton BN1 9QG, E Sussex, England","Wagner, GP (reprint author), Yale Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolut Biol, New Haven, CT 06520 USA.",gunter.wagner@yale.edu; cheverud@pcg.wustl.edu,,"Wagner, Gunter/0000-0002-3097-002X",,,,26,104,106,2,26,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,27-Mar,2008,452,7186,,,,,470,U9,,10.1038/nature06756,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,279FU,WOS:000254341300031,18368117,No,,,11/20/17

In Drosophila, courtship involves a complex yet stereotyped array of dimorphic behaviours that are regulated by Fru(M), a male- specific isoform of the fruitless gene(2-5). Fru(M) is expressed in about 2,000 neurons in the fly brain, including three subpopulations of olfactory sensory neurons and projection neurons ( PNs). One set of Fru(+) olfactory neurons expresses the odorant receptor Or67d and responds to the male-specific pheromone cis- vaccenyl acetate ( cVA)(6-10). These neurons converge on the DA1 glomerulus in the antennal lobe. In males, activation of Or67d 1 neurons by cVA inhibits courtship of other males, whereas in females their activation promotes receptivity to other males(7). These observations pose the question of how a single pheromone acting through the same set of sensory neurons can elicit different behaviours in male and female flies. Anatomical or functional dimorphisms in this neural circuit might be responsible for the dimorphic behaviour. We therefore developed a neural tracing procedure that employs two- photon laser scanning microscopy to activate the photoactivatable green fluorescent protein(11). Here we show, using this technique, that the projections from the DA1 glomerulus to the protocerebrum are sexually dimorphic. We observe a male- specific axonal arbor in the lateral horn whose elaboration requires the expression of the transcription factor Fru(M) in DA1 projection neurons and other Fru(+) cells. The observation that cVA activates a sexually dimorphic circuit in the protocerebrum suggests a mechanism by which a single pheromone can elicit different behaviours in males and in females.","[Datta, Sandeep Robert; Vasconcelos, Maria Luisa; Ruta, Vanessa; Luo, Sean; Wong, Allan; Flores, Jorge; Balonze, Karen; Axel, Richard] Columbia Univ, Coll Phys & Surg, Dept Biochem & Mol Biophys, New York, NY 10032 USA; [Datta, Sandeep Robert; Vasconcelos, Maria Luisa; Ruta, Vanessa; Luo, Sean; Wong, Allan; Flores, Jorge; Balonze, Karen; Axel, Richard] Columbia Univ, Coll Phys & Surg, Howard Hughes Med Inst, New York, NY 10032 USA; [Wong, Allan] CALTECH, Div Biol 216 76, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA; [Wong, Allan] CALTECH, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA; [Demir, Ebru; Dickson, Barry J.] Res Inst Mol Pathol IMP, A-1030 Vienna, Austria","Axel, R (reprint author), Columbia Univ, Coll Phys & Surg, Dept Biochem & Mol Biophys, New York, NY 10032 USA.",ra27@columbia.edu,,"Vasconcelos, Maria Luisa/0000-0001-6248-3667",Howard Hughes Medical Institute,,,27,190,193,3,39,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,27-Mar,2008,452,7186,,,,,473,477,,10.1038/nature06808,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,279FU,WOS:000254341300032,18305480,No,,,11/20/17

Signals from photoreceptors are processed by retinal interneurons, integrated by retinal ganglion cells ( RGCs) and sent to the brain by RGC axons. Distinct types of RGC respond to different visual features, such as increases or decreases in light intensity ( ON and OFF cells, respectively), colour or moving objects(1-5). Thus, RGCs comprise a set of parallel pathways from the eye to the brain. The identification of molecular markers for RGC subsets will facilitate attempts to correlate their structure with their function, assess their synaptic inputs and targets, and study their diversification. Here we show, by means of a transgenic marking method, that junctional adhesion molecule B ( JAM- B) marks a previously unrecognized class of OFF RGCs in mice. These cells have asymmetric dendritic arbors aligned in a dorsal- to- ventral direction across the retina. Their receptive fields are also asymmetric and respond selectively to stimuli moving in a soma- to- dendrite direction; because the lens reverses the image of the world on the retina, these cells detect upward motion in the visual field.

Increased [ CO2] has been shown to enhance anion channel activity(7) proposed to mediate efflux of osmoregulatory anions ( Cl- and malate(2-)) from guard cells during stomatal closure(8,9). However, the genes encoding anion efflux channels in plant plasma membranes remain unknown. Here we report the isolation of an Arabidopsis gene, SLAC1 ( SLOW ANION CHANNEL-ASSOCIATED 1, At1g12480), which mediates CO2 sensitivity in regulation of plant gas exchange. The SLAC1 protein is a distant homologue of bacterial and fungal C4- dicarboxylate transporters, and is localized specifically to the plasma membrane of guard cells. It belongs to a protein family that in Arabidopsis consists of four structurally related members that are common in their plasma membrane localization, but show distinct tissue- specific expression patterns. The loss- of- function mutation in SLAC1 was accompanied by an over- accumulation of the osmoregulatory anions in guard cell protoplasts. Guard- cell- specific expression of SLAC1 or its family members resulted in restoration of the wild- type stomatal responses, including CO2 sensitivity, and also in the dissipation of the over- accumulated anions. These results suggest that SLAC1-family proteins have an evolutionarily conserved function that is required for the maintenance of organic/ inorganic anion homeostasis on the cellular level.","[Negi, Juntaro; Matsuda, Osamu; Nagasawa, Takashi; Oba, Yasuhiro; Hashimoto, Mimi; Iba, Koh] Kyushu Univ, Fac Sci, Dept Biol, Fukuoka 8128581, Japan; [Takahashi, Hideyuki; Uchimiya, Hirofumi] Iwate Biotechnol Ctr, Kitakami, Iwate 0240003, Japan; [Kawai-Yamada, Maki; Uchimiya, Hirofumi] Univ Tokyo, Inst Mol & Cellular Biosci, Tokyo 1130032, Japan","Iba, K (reprint author), Kyushu Univ, Fac Sci, Dept Biol, Fukuoka 8128581, Japan.",koibascb@mbox.nc.kyushu-u.ac.jp,"Kawai-Yamada, Maki/B-2739-2012; Uchimiya, Hirofumi/B-3813-2012; U-ID, Kyushu/C-5291-2016","Kawai-Yamada, Maki/0000-0002-8732-052X; ",,,,33,246,266,7,91,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,27-Mar,2008,452,7186,,,,,483,U13,,10.1038/nature06720,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,279FU,WOS:000254341300034,18305482,No,Y,N,11/20/17

Stomata also restrict the entry of ozone - an important air pollutant that has an increasingly negative impact on crop yields, and thus global carbon fixation(1) and climate change(2). The aperture of stomatal pores is regulated by the transport of osmotically active ions and metabolites across guard cell membranes(3,4). Despite the vital role of guard cells in controlling plant water loss(3,4), ozone sensitivity(1,2) and CO2 supply(2,5-7), the genes encoding some of the main regulators of stomatal movements remain unknown. It has been proposed that guard cell anion channels function as important regulators of stomatal closure and are essential in mediating stomatal responses to physiological and stress stimuli(3,4,8). However, the genes encoding membrane proteins that mediate guard cell anion efflux have not yet been identified. Here we report the mapping and characterization of an ozone- sensitive Arabidopsis thaliana mutant, slac1. We show that SLAC1 ( SLOW ANION CHANNEL- ASSOCIATED 1) is preferentially expressed in guard cells and encodes a distant homologue of fungal and bacterial dicarboxylate/ malic acid transport proteins. The plasma membrane protein SLAC1 is essential for stomatal closure in response to CO2, abscisic acid, ozone, light/ dark transitions, humidity change, calcium ions, hydrogen peroxide and nitric oxide. Mutations in SLAC1 impair slow ( S- type) anion channel currents that are activated by cytosolic Ca2(+) and abscisic acid, but do not affect rapid ( R- type) anion channel currents or Ca2+ channel function. A low homology of SLAC1 to bacterial and fungal organic acid transport proteins, and the permeability of S- type anion channels to malate(9) suggest a vital role for SLAC1 in the function of S- type anion channels.","[Vahisalu, Triin; Kollist, Hannes; Lamminmaki, Airi; Brosche, Mikael; Kangasjarvi, Jaakko] Univ Helsinki, Dept Biol & Environm Sci, FI-00014 Helsinki, Finland; [Vahisalu, Triin] Univ Tartu, Dept Bot, Inst Ecol & Earth Sci, EE-51005 Tartu, Estonia; [Kollist, Hannes; Moldau, Heino] Univ Tartu, Inst Technol, EE-50411 Tartu, Estonia; [Wang, Yong-Fei; Nishimura, Noriyuki; Chan, Wai-Yin; Valerio, Gabriel; Schroeder, Julian I.] Univ Calif San Diego, Div Biol Sci, Cell & Dev Biol Sect, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Desikan, Radhika] Univ W England, Ctr Res Plant Sci, Bristol BS16 1QY, Avon, England","Kangasjarvi, J (reprint author), Univ Helsinki, Dept Biol & Environm Sci, FI-00014 Helsinki, Finland.",jaakko.kangasjarvi@helsinki.fi,"Nishimura, Noriyuki/E-3580-2010; Kangasjarvi, Jaakko/A-3024-2015; Brosche, Mikael/H-2260-2015; Kollist, Hannes/P-1548-2016","Kangasjarvi, Jaakko/0000-0002-8959-1809; Brosche, Mikael/0000-0002-1135-2496; Kollist, Hannes/0000-0002-6895-3583; Schroeder, Julian/0000-0002-3283-5972; Lamminmaki, Airi/0000-0002-6133-8553","NIEHS NIH HHS [P42 ES010337, P42 ES010337-070008]; NIGMS NIH HHS [R01 GM060396, R01 GM060396-07]",,,43,331,351,4,109,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,27-Mar,2008,452,7186,,,,,487,U15,,10.1038/nature06608,,7,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,279FU,WOS:000254341300035,18305484,No,Y,N,11/20/17

In mice, deficiency for the Sir2 family member SIRT6 leads to a shortened lifespan and a premature ageing- like phenotype(3). However, the molecular mechanisms of SIRT6 function are unclear. SIRT6 is a chromatin- associated protein(3), but no enzymatic activity of SIRT6 at chromatin has yet been detected, and the identity of physiological SIRT6 substrates is unknown. Here we show that the human SIRT6 protein is an NAD(+)-dependent, histone H3 lysine 9 ( H3K9) deacetylase that modulates telomeric chromatin. SIRT6 associates specifically with telomeres, and SIRT6 depletion leads to telomere dysfunction with end- to- end chromosomal fusions and premature cellular senescence. Moreover, SIRT6- depleted cells exhibit abnormal telomere structures that resemble defects observed in Werner syndrome, a premature ageing disorder(4,5). At telomeric chromatin, SIRT6 deacetylates H3K9 and is required for the stable association of WRN, the factor that is mutated in Werner syndrome(4,5). We propose that SIRT6 contributes to the propagation of a specialized chromatin state at mammalian telomeres, which in turn is required for proper telomere metabolism and function. Our findings constitute the first identification of a physiological enzymatic activity of SIRT6, and link chromatin regulation by SIRT6 to telomere maintenance and a human premature ageing syndrome.","[Michishita, Eriko; McCord, Ronald A.; Berber, Elisabeth; Damian, Mara; Chua, Katrin F.] Stanford Univ, Dept Med, Div Endocrinol Gerontol & Metab, Sch Med, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Kioi, Mitomu] Stanford Univ, Dept Radiat Oncol, Sch Med, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Cheung, Peggie; Gozani, Or] Stanford Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Kawahara, Tiara L.

This inference of homogeneity has been complicated by the occurrence of portions enriched in incompatible elements. Here we show that some refractory abyssal peridotites from the ultraslow- spreading Gakkel ridge ( Arctic Ocean) have very depleted Os-187/Os-188 ratios with model ages up to 2 billion years, implying the long- term preservation of refractory domains in the asthenospheric mantle rather than their erasure by mantle convection. The refractory domains would not be sampled by mid- ocean- ridge basalts because they contribute little to the genesis of magmas. We thus suggest that the upwelling mantle beneath mid- ocean ridges is highly heterogeneous, which makes it difficult to constrain its composition by mid- ocean- ridge basalts alone. Furthermore, the existence of ancient domains in oceanic mantle suggests that using osmium model ages to constrain the evolution of continental lithosphere should be approached with caution.","[Liu, Chuan-Zhou] Chinese Acad Sci, State Key Lab Lithospher Evolut, Inst Geol & Geophys, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China; [Liu, Chuan-Zhou; Snow, Jonathan E.; Hellebrand, Eric; Bruegmann, Gerhard; von der Handt, Anette; Buechl, Anette; Hofmann, Albrecht W.] Max Planck Inst Chem, Abt Geochem, D-55020 Mainz, Germany; [Liu, Chuan-Zhou] Grad Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Coll Earth Sci, Beijing 100039, Peoples R China; [Snow, Jonathan E.] Univ Houston, Dept Geosci, Houston, TX 77204 USA; [Hellebrand, Eric; von der Handt, Anette] Univ Hawaii, Dept Geol & Geophys, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA","Liu, CZ (reprint author), Chinese Acad Sci, State Key Lab Lithospher Evolut, Inst Geol & Geophys, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China.",chzliu@mail.iggcas.ac.cn,"Liu, Chuanzhou/A-1627-2011; Snow, Jonathan/E-5591-2011; Hellebrand, Eric/L-2898-2013",,,,,50,136,143,3,51,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,20-Mar,2008,452,7185,,,,,311,316,,10.1038/nature06688,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,276BX,WOS:000254117400038,18354475,No,,,11/20/17

Rapid induction of gene expression of thyroid- hormone- activating enzyme ( type 2 deiodinase, DIO2) in the mediobasal hypothalamus ( MBH) of the Japanese quail ( Coturnix japonica) is the earliest event yet recorded in the photoperiodic signal transduction pathway. Here we show cascades of gene expression in the quail MBH associated with the initiation of photoinduced secretion of luteinizing hormone. We identified two waves of gene expression. The first was initiated about 14 h after dawn of the first long day and included increased thyrotrophin ( TSH) beta- subunit expression in the pars tuberalis; the second occurred approximately 4 h later and included increased expression of DIO2. Intracerebroventricular ( ICV) administration of TSH to short- day quail stimulated gonadal growth and expression of DIO2 which was shown to be mediated through a TSH receptor - cyclic AMP ( cAMP) signalling pathway. Increased TSH in the pars tuberalis therefore seems to trigger long- day photoinduced seasonal breeding.","[Nakao, Nobuhiro; Ono, Hiroko; Yamamura, Takashi; Anraku, Tsubasa; Takagi, Tsuyoshi; Higashi, Kumiko; Yasuo, Shinobu; Katou, Yasuhiro; Kageyama, Saburo; Uno, Yumiko; Ebihara, Shizufumi; Yoshimura, Takashi] Nagoya Univ, Grad Sch Bioagr Sci, Chikusa Ku, Div Biomodelling, Nagoya, Aichi 4648601, Japan; [Kasukawa, Takeya; Ueda, Hiroki R.] RIKEN, Funct Genom Subunit, Ctr Dev Biol, Chuo Ku, Kobe, Hyogo 6500047, Japan; [Iigo, Masayuki] Utsunomiya Univ, Fac Agr, Dept Appl Biochem, Utsunomiya, Tochigi 3218505, Japan; [Sharp, Peter J.] Univ Edinburgh, Div Genet & Genom, Roslin Inst, Roslin EH25 9PS, Midlothian, Scotland; [Sharp, Peter J.] Univ Edinburgh, Div Genet & Genom, Royal Dick Sch Vet Studies, Roslin EH25 9PS, Midlothian, Scotland; [Iwasawa, Atsushi] Gifu Univ, Lab Comparat Biochem, Grad Sch Appl Biol Sci, Gifu 5011193, Japan; [Suzuki, Yutaka; Sugano, Sumio] Univ Tokyo, Dept Med Genome Sci, Grad Sch Frontier Sci, Minato Ku, Tokyo 1088639, Japan; [Niimi, Teruyuki] Nagoya Univ, Grad Sch Bioagr Sci, Chikusa Ku, Div Biofunct Dev, Nagoya, Aichi 4648601, Japan; [Mizutani, Makoto; Namikawa, Takao; Ebihara, Shizufumi; Yoshimura, Takashi] Nagoya Univ, Grad Sch Bioagr Sci, Chikusa Ku, Avian Biosci Res Ctr, Nagoya, Aichi 4648601, Japan; [Ueda, Hiroki R.] RIKEN, Lab Syst Biol, Ctr Dev Biol, Chuo Ku, Kobe, Hyogo 6500047, Japan; [Yoshimura, Takashi] Nagoya Univ, Chikusa Ku, Inst Adv Res, Nagoya, Aichi 4648601, Japan","Yoshimura, T (reprint author), Nagoya Univ, Grad Sch Bioagr Sci, Chikusa Ku, Div Biomodelling, Furo Cho, Nagoya, Aichi 4648601, Japan.",takashiy@agr.nagoya-u.ac.jp,"Yoshimura, Takashi/C-8306-2012; Ueda, Hiroki/C-5037-2014; Kasukawa, Takeya/N-5070-2015","Yoshimura, Takashi/0000-0001-7018-9652; Kasukawa, Takeya/0000-0001-5085-0802",,,,39,233,240,0,48,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,20-Mar,2008,452,7185,,,,,317,U1,,10.1038/nature06738,,7,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,276BX,WOS:000254117400039,18354476,No,,,11/20/17

Here we show that translational control is critical for induction of type- I IFN production. In mouse embryonic fibroblasts lacking the translational repressors 4E- BP1 and 4E- BP2, the threshold for eliciting type- I IFN production is lowered. Consequently, replication of encephalomyocarditis virus, vesicular stomatitis virus, influenza virus and Sindbis virus is markedly suppressed. Furthermore, mice with both 4E- BP1 and 4E- BP2 genes ( also known as Eif4ebp1 and Eif4ebp2, respectively) knocked out are resistant to vesicular stomatitis virus infection, and this correlates with an enhanced type- I IFN production in plasmacytoid dendritic cells and the expression of IFN- regulated genes in the lungs. The enhanced type- I IFN response in 4E-BP1(-/-) 4E-BP2(-/-) double knockout mouse embryonic fibroblasts is caused by upregulation of interferon regulatory factor 7 ( Irf7) messenger RNA translation. These findings highlight the role of 4E- BPs as negative regulators of type- I IFN production, via translational repression of Irf7 mRNA.","[Colina, Rodney; Costa-Mattioli, Mauro; Dowling, Ryan J.

The rotational - vibrational transition bands of water, carbon monoxide and methane are anticipated to be the primary sources of non- continuum opacity in hot- Jupiter planets(1-3). As these bands can overlap in wavelength, and the corresponding signatures from them are weak, decisive identification requires precision infrared spectroscopy. Here we report a near- infrared transmission spectrum of the planet HD 189733b that shows the presence of methane. Additionally, a resolved water vapour band at 1.9 mu m confirms the recent claim(4) of water in this object. On thermochemical grounds, carbon monoxide is expected to be abundant in the upper atmosphere of hot- Jupiter planets, but is not identifiable here; therefore the detection of methane rather than carbon monoxide in such a hot planet(5,6) could signal the presence of a horizontal chemical gradient away from the permanent dayside, or it may imply an ill- understood photochemical mechanism that leads to an enhancement of methane.","[Swain, Mark R.; Vasisht, Gautam] CALTECH, Jet Prop Lab, Pasadena, CA 91109 USA; [Tinetti, Giovanna] UCL, Dept Phys & Astron, London WC1E 6BT, England","Swain, MR (reprint author), CALTECH, Jet Prop Lab, 4800 Oak Grove Dr, Pasadena, CA 91109 USA.",Mark.R.Swain@jpl.nasa.gov,,"Tinetti, Giovanna/0000-0001-6058-6654",,,,25,337,340,3,30,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,20-Mar,2008,452,7185,,,,,329,331,,10.1038/nature06823,,3,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,276BX,WOS:000254117400041,18354477,No,Y,N,11/20/17

One of the prerequisites(1) for understanding this elimination of antimatter is the nonconservation of charge- parity ( CP) symmetry. So far, two types of CP violation have been observed in the neutral K meson ( K-0) and B meson ( B-0) systems: CP violation involving the mixing(2) between K-0 and its antiparticle (K) over bar (0) ( and likewise(3,4) for B-0 and (B) over bar (0)), and direct CP violation in the decay of each meson(5-8). The observed effects for both types of CP violation are substantially larger for the B-0 meson system. However, they are still consistent with the standard model of particle physics, which has a unique source(9) of CP violation that is known to be too small(10) to account for the matter-dominated Universe. Here we report that the direct CP violation in charged B-+/- --> K-+/- pi(0) decay is different from that in the neutral B-0 counterpart. The direct CP- violating decay rate asymmetry, A(K)+/- (pi 0) ( that is, the difference between the number of observed B- --> K- pi(0) event versus B+ --> K+ pi(0) events, normalized to the sum of these events) is measured to be about +7%, with an uncertainty that is reduced by a factor of 1.7 from a previous measurement(7). However, the asymmetry A(K+/-) p(-/+) for B-0 --> K- pi(+) versus B-0 --> K+ pi(-) is at the -10% level(7,8). Although it is susceptible to strong interaction effects that need further clarification, this large deviation in direct CP violation between charged and neutral B meson decays could be an indication of new sources of CP violation - which would help to explain the dominance of matter in the Universe.","[Lin, S. -W.; Hou, W. -S.; Chang, P.; Chao, Y.; Chen, K. -F.; Chiang, C. -C.; Wang, C.

This chronology, however, assumes that the composition of the total planet is identical to that of primitive undifferentiated meteorites called chondrites. The difference in the Nd-142/Nd-144 ratio between chondrites and terrestrial samples may therefore indicate very early isolation (<30Myr from the formation of the Solar System) of the upper mantle or a slightly non- chondritic bulk Earth composition(5,6). Here we present high-precision Nd-142 data for 16 martian meteorites and show that Mars also has a non- chondritic composition. Meteorites belonging to the shergottite subgroup define a planetary isochron yielding an age of differentiation of 40 +/- 18 Myr for the martian mantle. This isochron does not pass through the chondritic reference value ( 100 x epsilon Nd-142 = -21 +/- 3; Sm-147/Nd-144 = 0.1966)(6). The Earth, Moon and Mars all seem to have accreted in a portion of the inner Solar System with similar to 5 per cent higher Sm/Nd ratios than material accreted in the asteroid belt. Such chemical heterogeneities may have arisen from sorting of nebular solids or from impact erosion of crustal reservoirs in planetary precursors. The Nd-143 composition of the primitive mantle so defined by Nd-142 is strikingly similar to the putative endmember component 'FOZO' characterized by high He-3/He-4 ratios(7,8).","[Caro, Guillaume] Univ Paris 07, Lab Geochim & Cosmochimie, Inst Phys Globe, F-75252 Paris 05, France; [Bourdon, Bernard] ETH, Inst Isotope Geochem & Mineral Resources, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland; [Halliday, Alex N.] Univ Oxford, Dept Earth Sci, Oxford OX1 3PR, England; [Quitte, Ghylaine] Ecole Normale Super Lyon, Lab Sci Terre, F-69364 Lyon 7, France","Caro, G (reprint author), Univ Paris 07, Lab Geochim & Cosmochimie, Inst Phys Globe, 4 Pl Jussieu, F-75252 Paris 05, France.",caro@crpg.cnrs-nancy.fr,"Bourdon, Bernard/A-3303-2008; Quitte, Ghylaine/N-8888-2013",,,,,30,98,102,7,47,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,20-Mar,2008,452,7185,,,,,336,339,,10.1038/nature06760,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,276BX,WOS:000254117400043,18354479,No,,,11/20/17

The biogeography of phages has only recently been investigated and so far reveals a cosmopolitan distribution of phage genetic material ( or genotypes)(1-4). Here we address this cosmopolitan distribution through the analysis of phage communities in modern microbialites, the living representatives of one of the most ancient life forms on Earth. On the basis of a comparative metagenomic analysis of viral communities associated with marine ( Highborne Cay, Bahamas) and freshwater ( Pozas Azules II and Rio Mesquites, Mexico) microbialites, we show that some phage genotypes are geographically restricted. The high percentage of unknown sequences recovered from the three metagenomes (>97%), the low percentage similarities with sequences from other environmental viral ( n = 42) and microbial ( n = 36) metagenomes, and the absence of viral genotypes shared among microbialites indicate that viruses are genetically unique in these environments. Identifiable sequences in the Highborne Cay metagenome were dominated by single- stranded DNA microphages that were not detected in any other samples examined, including sea water, fresh water, sediment, terrestrial, extreme, metazoan- associated and marine microbial mats. Finally, a marine signature was present in the phage community of the Pozas Azules II microbialites, even though this environment has not been in contact with the ocean for tens of millions of years. Taken together, these results prove that viruses in modern microbialites display biogeographical variability and suggest that they may be derived from an ancient community.","[Desnues, Christelle; Rodriguez-Brito, Beltran; Rayhawk, Steve; Kelley, Scott; Tran, Tuong; Haynes, Matthew; Liu, Hong; Furlan, Mike; Wegley, Linda; Chau, Betty; Hall, Dana; Angly, Florent E.; Edwards, Robert A.; Li, Linlin; Thurber, Rebecca Vega; Rohwer, Forest] San Diego State Univ, Dept Biol, San Diego, CA 92182 USA; [Rodriguez-Brito, Beltran; Rayhawk, Steve; Edwards, Robert A.] San Diego State Univ, Computat Sci Res Ctr, San Diego, CA 92182 USA; [Kelley, Scott; Edwards, Robert A.; Rohwer, Forest] San Diego State Univ, Ctr Microbial Sci, San Diego, CA 92182 USA; [Ruan, Yijun] Genome Inst Singapore, Singapore 138672, Singapore; [Edwards, Robert A.] Argonne Natl Lab, Div Math & Comp Sci, Argonne, IL 60439 USA; [Reid, R.

Variable abundance data, however, make the demonstration of regulation processes challenging(1-3). A previously overlooked aspect in understanding how populations are regulated(4-6) is the possibility that the pattern of variability - its strength as a function of population size - may be more than 'noise', thus revealing much about the characteristics of population regulation. Here we show that patterns in survival variability do provide evidence of regulation through density. Using a large, global compilation of marine, anadromous and freshwater fisheries data, we examine the relationship between the variability of survival and population abundance. The interannual variability in progeny survival increases at low adult abundance in an inversely density- dependent fashion. This pattern is consistent with models in which density dependence enters after the larval stage. The findings are compatible with very simple forms of density dependence: even a linear increase of juvenile mortality with adult density adequately explains the results. The model predictions explain why populations with strong regulation may experience large increases in variability at low densities(7). Furthermore, the inverse relationship between survival variability and the strength of density dependence has important consequences for fisheries management and recovery, and population persistence or extinction(8-10).","[Minto, Coilin] Dalhousie Univ, Dept Biol, Halifax, NS B3H 4J1, Canada; [Blanchard, Wade] Dalhousie Univ, Dept Math & Stat, Halifax, NS B3H 3J5, Canada","Minto, C (reprint author), Dalhousie Univ, Dept Biol, Halifax, NS B3H 4J1, Canada.",mintoc@mathstat.dal.ca,,"Minto, Coilin/0000-0003-0630-6775",,,,33,51,52,2,66,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,20-Mar,2008,452,7185,,,,,344,U6,,10.1038/nature06605,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,276BX,WOS:000254117400045,18354480,No,,,11/20/17

We tend to help others even if costs are involved. We are more likely to help when the costs are small and the benefits for the other person significant. Cooperation leads to a tension between what is best for the individual and what is best for the group. A group does better if everyone cooperates, but each individual is tempted to defect. Recently there has been much interest in exploring the effect of costly punishment on human cooperation(8-23). Costly punishment means paying a cost for another individual to incur a cost. It has been suggested that costly punishment promotes cooperation even in non- repeated games and without any possibility of reputation effects(10). But most of our interactions are repeated and reputation is always at stake. Thus, if costly punishment is important in promoting cooperation, it must do so in a repeated setting. We have performed experiments in which, in each round of a repeated game, people choose between cooperation, defection and costly punishment. In control experiments, people could only cooperate or defect. Here we show that the option of costly punishment increases the amount of cooperation but not the average payoff of the group. Furthermore, there is a strong negative correlation between total payoff and use of costly punishment. Those people who gain the highest total payoff tend not to use costly punishment: winners don't punish. This suggests that costly punishment behaviour is maladaptive in cooperation games and might have evolved for other reasons.","[Dreber, Anna; Rand, David G.; Nowak, Martin A.] Harvard Univ, Program Evolutionary Dynam, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Rand, David G.] Harvard Univ, Dept Syst Biol, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Fudenberg, Drew] Harvard Univ, Dept Econ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Nowak, Martin A.] Harvard Univ, Dept Math, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Nowak, Martin A.] Harvard Univ, Dept Organism & Evolut Biol, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Dreber, Anna] Stockholm Sch Econ, Dept Econ, S-11358 Stockholm, Sweden","Nowak, MA (reprint author), Harvard Univ, Program Evolutionary Dynam, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",martin_nowak@harvard.edu,"Rand, David/B-3716-2009; Dreber, Anna/D-8709-2010; Nowak, Martin/A-6977-2008","Rand, David/0000-0002-2821-468X; Rand, David/0000-0001-8975-2783","NIGMS NIH HHS [R01 GM078986, R01 GM078986-02]",,,30,293,299,6,73,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,20-Mar,2008,452,7185,,,,,348,351,,10.1038/nature06723,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,276BX,WOS:000254117400046,18354481,No,Y,N,11/20/17

Recent functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI) studies have decoded orientation(1,2), position(3) and object category(4,5) from activity in visual cortex. However, these studies typically used relatively simple stimuli ( for example, gratings) or images drawn from fixed categories ( for example, faces, houses), and decoding was based on previous measurements of brain activity evoked by those same stimuli or categories. To overcome these limitations, here we develop a decoding method based on quantitative receptive- field models that characterize the relationship between visual stimuli and fMRI activity in early visual areas. These models describe the tuning of individual voxels for space, orientation and spatial frequency, and are estimated directly from responses evoked by natural images. We show that these receptive- field models make it possible to identify, from a large set of completely novel natural images, which specific image was seen by an observer. Identification is not a mere consequence of the retinotopic organization of visual areas; simpler receptive- field models that describe only spatial tuning yield much poorer identification performance. Our results suggest that it may soon be possible to reconstruct a picture of a person's visual experience from measurements of brain activity alone.","[Kay, Kendrick N.; Gallant, Jack L.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Psychol, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Naselaris, Thomas; Gallant, Jack L.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Helen Wills Neurosci Inst, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Prenger, Ryan J.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Phys, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA","Gallant, JL (reprint author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Psychol, 3210 Tolman Hall, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",gallant@berkeley.edu,"; Kay, Kendrick/A-4344-2009; Gallant, Jack/C-4426-2011","Kay, Kendrick/0000-0001-6604-9155; ",NEI NIH HHS [R01 EY019684],,,30,450,464,3,79,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,20-Mar,2008,452,7185,,,,,352,U7,,10.1038/nature06713,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,276BX,WOS:000254117400047,18322462,No,Y,N,11/20/17

Understanding the mechanisms by which memory T cells arise is important for rational vaccination strategies and improved therapeutic interventions for chronic infections and autoimmune disorders. The large clonal expansion of CD8 T cells in response to some infections has made the development of CD8 T- cell memory more amenable to study, giving rise to a model of memory cell differentiation in which a fraction of fully competent effector T cells transition into long-lived memory T cells(4,6,7). Delineation of CD4 T- cell memory development has proved more difficult as a result of limitations on tracking the smaller populations of CD4 effector T cells generated during a pathogenic challenge(8-10), complicating efforts to determine whether CD4 memory T cells are direct descendants of effector T cells or whether they develop by alternative pathways(3,4). Here, using two complementary cytokine reporter mouse models to identify interferon ( IFN)- gamma-positive effector T cells and track their fate, we show that the lineage relationship between effector and memory CD4 T cells resembles that for CD8 T cells responding to the same pathogen. We find that, in parallel with effector CD8 T cells, IFN-gamma-positive effector CD4 T cells give rise to long- lived memory T cells capable of anamnestic responses to antigenic rechallenge.","[Harrington, Laurie E.; Janowski, Karen M.; Oliver, James R.; Weaver, Casey T.] Univ Alabama, Dept Pathol, Birmingham, AL 35294 USA; [Zajac, Allan J.] Univ Alabama, Dept Microbiol, Birmingham, AL 35294 USA","Weaver, CT (reprint author), Univ Alabama, Dept Pathol, 845 19th St S, Birmingham, AL 35294 USA.",cweaver@uab.edu,,"Weaver, Casey/0000-0002-2180-1793",,,,35,124,131,0,8,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,20-Mar,2008,452,7185,,,,,356,U8,,10.1038/nature06672,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,276BX,WOS:000254117400048,18322463,No,,,11/20/17

Mechanotransduction relies on the transformation of minuscule mechanical forces into high- fidelity electrical responses(1-3). When mechanoreceptors are stimulated, mechanically sensitive cation channels open and produce an inward transduction current that depolarizes the cell. For this process to operate effectively, the transduction machinery has to retain integrity and remain unfailingly independent of environmental changes. This is particularly challenging for poikilothermic organisms, where changes in temperature in the environment may impact the function of mechanoreceptor neurons. Thus, we wondered how insects whose habitat might quickly vary over several tens of degrees of temperature manage to maintain highly effective mechanical senses. We screened for Drosophila mutants with defective mechanical responses at elevated ambient temperatures, and identified a gene, spam, whose role is to protect the mechanosensory organ from massive cellular deformation caused by heat-induced osmotic imbalance. Here we show that Spam protein forms an extracellular shield that guards mechanosensory neurons from environmental insult. Remarkably, heterologously expressed Spam protein also endowed other cells with superb defence against physically and chemically induced deformation. We studied the mechanical impact of Spam coating and show that spam- coated cells are up to ten times stiffer than uncoated controls. Together, these results help explain how poikilothermic organisms preserve the architecture of critical cells during environmental stress, and illustrate an elegant and simple solution to such challenge.","[Cook, Boaz; Hardy, Robert W.; Zuker, Charles S.] Univ Calif San Diego, Howard Hughes Med Inst, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Cook, Boaz; Hardy, Robert W.; Zuker, Charles S.] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Neurobiol, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Cook, Boaz; Hardy, Robert W.; Zuker, Charles S.] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Neurosci, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [McConnaughey, William B.] Washington Univ, Sch Med, Dept Biochem & Mol Biophys, St Louis, MO 63110 USA","Zuker, CS (reprint author), Univ Calif San Diego, Howard Hughes Med Inst, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.",charles@flyeye.ucsd.edu,,,"Howard Hughes Medical Institute; NEI NIH HHS [R01 EY006979-18, R01 EY006979]",,,18,33,33,0,12,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,20-Mar,2008,452,7185,,,,,361,U9,,10.1038/nature06603,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,276BX,WOS:000254117400049,18297055,No,,,11/20/17

REST is expressed in non- neuronal cells and stem/ progenitor neuronal cells, in which it inhibits the expression of neuron- specific genes. Overexpression of REST is frequently found in human medulloblastomas and neuroblastomas(3-7), in which it is thought to maintain the stem character of tumour cells. Neural stem cells forced to express REST and c- Myc fail to differentiate and give rise to tumours in the mouse cerebellum(3). Expression of a splice variant of REST that lacks the carboxy terminus has been associated with neuronal tumours and small- cell lung carcinomas(8-10), and a frameshift mutant ( REST- FS), which is also truncated at the C terminus, has oncogenic properties(11). Here we show, by using an unbiased screen, that REST is an interactor of the F- box protein beta-TrCP. REST is degraded by means of the ubiquitin ligase SCF beta-TrCP during the G2 phase of the cell cycle to allow transcriptional derepression of Mad2, an essential component of the spindle assembly checkpoint. The expression in cultured cells of a stable REST mutant, which is unable to bind beta-TrCP, inhibited Mad2 expression and resulted in a phenotype analogous to that observed in Mad2(+/-) cells. In particular, we observed defects that were consistent with faulty activation of the spindle checkpoint, such as shortened mitosis, premature sister- chromatid separation, chromosome bridges and mis- segregation in anaphase, tetraploidy, and faster mitotic slippage in the presence of a spindle inhibitor. An indistinguishable phenotype was observed by expressing the oncogenic REST- FS mutant(11), which does not bind beta-TrCP. Thus, SCF beta-TrCP-dependent degradation of REST during G2 permits the optimal activation of the spindle checkpoint, and consequently it is required for the fidelity of mitosis. The high levels of REST or its truncated variants found in certain human tumours may contribute to cellular transformation by promoting genomic instability.","[Guardavaccaro, Daniele; Frescas, David; Dorrello, N.

Recently, REST was identified as a human tumour suppressor in epithelial tissues(4), suggesting that its regulation may have important physiological and pathological consequences. However, the pathways controlling REST have yet to be elucidated. Here we show that REST is regulated by ubiquitin- mediated proteolysis, and use an RNA interference ( RNAi) screen to identify a Skp1- Cul1- F- box protein complex containing the F- box protein beta- TRCP ( SCF beta-TRCP) as an E3 ubiquitin ligase responsible for REST degradation. beta- TRCP binds and ubiquitinates REST and controls its stability through a conserved phospho- degron. During neural differentiation, REST is degraded in a beta-TRCP- dependent manner. beta- TRCP is required for proper neural differentiation only in the presence of REST, indicating that beta- TRCP facilitates this process through degradation of REST. Conversely, failure to degrade REST attenuates differentiation. Furthermore, we find that beta-TRCP overexpression, which is common in human epithelial cancers, causes oncogenic transformation of human mammary epithelial cells and that this pathogenic function requires REST degradation. Thus, REST is a key target in beta- TRCP- driven transformation and the beta- TRCP - REST axis is a new regulatory pathway controlling neurogenesis.","[Westbrook, Thomas F.; Hu, Guang; Pavlova, Natalya N.; Liang, Anthony; Leng, Yumei; Elledge, Stephen J.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Dept Genet,Harvard Partners Ctr Genet & Genom, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Ang, Xiaolu L.; Mulligan, Peter; Shi, Yang; Harper, J.

The family codes for a structurally conserved scaffold of channel proteins that open in response to the binding of neurotransmitter molecules. All proteins share a pentameric organization of identical or related subunits that consist of an extracellular ligand- binding domain followed by a transmembrane channel domain. The nicotinic acetylcholine receptor ( nAChR) is the most thoroughly studied member of the pLGIC family ( for recent reviews see refs 1 - 3). Two sources of structural information provided an architectural framework for the family. The structure of the soluble acetylcholine- binding protein ( AChBP) defined the organization of the extracellular domain and revealed the chemical basis of ligand interaction(4-6). Electron microscopy studies of the nAChR from Torpedo electric ray have yielded a picture of the full- length protein and have recently led to the interpretation of an electron density map at 4.0 angstrom resolution(7-9). Despite the wealth of experimental information, high- resolution structures of any family member have so far not been available. Until recently, the pLGICs were believed to be only expressed in multicellular eukaryotic organisms. The abundance of prokaryotic genome sequences, however, allowed the identification of several homologous proteins in bacterial sources(10,11). Here we present the X- ray structure of a prokaryotic pLGIC from the bacterium Erwinia chrysanthemi ( ELIC) at 3.3 angstrom resolution. Our study reveals the first structure of a pLGIC at high resolution and provides an important model system for the investigation of the general mechanisms of ion permeation and gating within the family.","[Hilf, Ricarda J.

We show that binding of phosphotyrosine peptides to PKM2 results in release of the allosteric activator fructose- 1,6- bisphosphate, leading to inhibition of PKM2 enzymatic activity. We also provide evidence that this regulation of PKM2 by phosphotyrosine signalling diverts glucose metabolites from energy production to anabolic processes when cells are stimulated by certain growth factors.

Here we show that SATB1 is expressed by aggressive breast cancer cells and its expression level has high prognostic significance ( P < 0.0001), independent of lymph- node status. RNA- interference- mediated knockdown of SATB1 in highly aggressive ( MDA- MB- 231) cancer cells altered the expression of >1,000 genes, reversing tumorigenesis by restoring breast- like acinar polarity and inhibiting tumour growth and metastasis in vivo. Conversely, ectopic SATB1 expression in non- aggressive ( SKBR3) cells led to gene expression patterns consistent with aggressive- tumour phenotypes, acquiring metastatic activity in vivo. SATB1 delineates specific epigenetic modifications at target gene loci, directly upregulating metastasis- associated genes while downregulating tumour- suppressor genes. SATB1 reprogrammes chromatin organization and the transcription profiles of breast tumours to promote growth and metastasis; this is a new mechanism of tumour progression.","[Han, Hye-Jung; Kohwi, Yoshinori; Kohwi-Shigematsu, Terumi] Univ Calif Berkeley, Div Life Sci, Lawrence Berkeley Lab, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Russo, Jose] Fox Chase Canc Ctr, Breast Canc Res Lab, Philadelphia, PA 19111 USA","Kohwi-Shigematsu, T (reprint author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Div Life Sci, Lawrence Berkeley Lab, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",YKohwi@lbl.gov; Terumiks@lbl.gov,,,,,,50,312,353,1,26,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,13-Mar,2008,452,7184,,,,,187,193,,10.1038/nature06781,,7,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,273JG,WOS:000253925600034,18337816,No,,,11/20/17

Interstellar grains of typical size similar to 0.1 mm are expected to grow to millimetre- ( sand), centimetre( pebble) or even metre- sized ( boulder) objects rather quickly(2). Unfortunately, such evolved disks are hard to observe because the ratio of surface area to volume of their constituents is small. We readily detect dust around young objects known as 'classical' T Tauri stars, but there is little or no evidence of it in the slightly more evolved 'weak- line' systems(3). Here we report observations of a 3-Myr- old star, which show that grains have grown to about millimetre size or larger in the terrestrial zone ( within similar to 3 AU) of this star.

These features, and the ability to create DNA strands with any desired sequence of bases, have led to the use of DNA rationally to design various nanostructures and even execute molecular computations(1-4). Of the wide range of self- assembled DNA nanostructures reported, most are one- or two- dimensional(5-9). Examples of three- dimensional DNA structures include cubes(10), truncated octahedra(11), octohedra(12) and tetrahedra(13,14), which are all comprised of many different DNA strands with unique sequences. When aiming for large structures, the need to synthesize large numbers ( hundreds) of unique DNA strands poses a challenging design problem(9,15). Here, we demonstrate a simple solution to this problem: the design of basic DNA building units in such a way that many copies of identical units assemble into larger three- dimensional structures. We test this hierarchical self- assembly concept with DNA molecules that form three- point- star motifs, or tiles. By controlling the flexibility and concentration of the tiles, the one- pot assembly yields tetrahedra, dodecahedra or buckyballs that are tens of nanometres in size and comprised of four, twenty or sixty individual tiles, respectively. We expect that our assembly strategy can be adapted to allow the fabrication of a range of relatively complex three- dimensional structures.","[He, Yu; Ye, Tao; Zhang, Chuan; Ribbe, Alexander E.; Mao, Chengde] Purdue Univ, Dept Chem, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA; [Su, Min; Jiang, Wen] Purdue Univ, Markey Ctr Struct Biol, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA; [Su, Min; Jiang, Wen] Purdue Univ, Dept Biol Sci, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA","Mao, CD (reprint author), Purdue Univ, Dept Chem, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA.",mao@purdue.edu,"Ribbe, Alexander/D-4988-2009; He, Yu/A-6189-2011; Zhang, Chuan/B-4349-2014","Ribbe, Alexander/0000-0002-9924-3429; Zhang, Chuan/0000-0003-2981-0923",,,,20,596,608,32,249,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,13-Mar,2008,452,7184,,,,,198,U41,,10.1038/nature06597,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,273JG,WOS:000253925600036,18337818,No,Y,N,11/20/17

Large- scale nitrogen budgets show that an average of about 20 - 25 per cent of the nitrogen added to the biosphere is exported from rivers to the ocean or inland basins(7,8), indicating that substantial sinks for nitrogen must exist in the landscape(9). Streams and rivers may themselves be important sinks for bioavailable nitrogen owing to their hydrological connections with terrestrial systems, high rates of biological activity, and streambed sediment environments that favour microbial denitrification(6,10,11). Here we present data from nitrogen stable isotope tracer experiments across 72 streams and 8 regions representing several biomes. We show that total biotic uptake and denitrification of nitrate increase with stream nitrate concentration, but that the efficiency of biotic uptake and denitrification declines as concentration increases, reducing the proportion of in- stream nitrate that is removed from transport. Our data suggest that the total uptake of nitrate is related to ecosystem photosynthesis and that denitrification is related to ecosystem respiration. In addition, we use a stream network model to demonstrate that excess nitrate in streams elicits a disproportionate increase in the fraction of nitrate that is exported to receiving waters and reduces the relative role of small versus large streams as nitrate sinks.","[Mulholland, Patrick J.] Oak Ridge Natl Lab, Div Environm Sci, Oak Ridge, TN 37831 USA; [Mulholland, Patrick J.; Cooper, Lee W.] Univ Tennessee, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA; [Helton, Ashley M.; Poole, Geoffrey C.; Meyer, Judy L.] Univ Georgia, Odum Sch Ecol, Athens, GA 30602 USA; [Poole, Geoffrey C.] Ecometr Inc, Tucker, GA 30084 USA; [Hall, Robert O., Jr.] Univ Wyoming, Dept Zool & Physiol, Laramie, WY 82071 USA; [Hamilton, Stephen K.; Burgin, Amy J.; O'Brien, Jonathan M.] Michigan State Univ, Kellogg Biol Stn, Hickory Corners, MI 49060 USA; [Peterson, Bruce J.; Thomas, Suzanne M.] Marine Biol Lab, Ctr Ecosyst, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA; [Tank, Jennifer L.; Arango, Clay P.; Beaulieu, Jake J.; Johnson, Laura T.] Univ Notre Dame, Dept Biol Sci, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA; [Ashkenas, Linda R.; Gregory, Stanley V.; Sobota, Daniel J.] Oregon State Univ, Dept Fisheries & Wildlife, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA; [Dahm, Clifford N.; Crenshaw, Chelsea L.] Univ New Mexico, Dept Biol, Albuquerque, NM 87131 USA; [Dodds, Walter K.] Kansas State Univ, Div Biol, Manhattan, KS 66506 USA; [Findlay, Stuart E.

But its climatic influence, on monthly and longer timescales, remains poorly understood. In particular, it is unclear how the warm current affects the free atmosphere above the marine atmospheric boundary layer. Here we consider the Gulf Stream's influence on the troposphere, using a combination of operational weather analyses, satellite observations and an atmospheric general circulation model(4). Our results reveal that the Gulf Stream affects the entire troposphere. In the marine boundary layer, atmospheric pressure adjustments to sharp sea surface temperature gradients lead to surface wind convergence, which anchors a narrow band of precipitation along the Gulf Stream. In this rain band, upward motion and cloud formation extend into the upper troposphere, as corroborated by the frequent occurrence of very low cloud- top temperatures. These mechanisms provide a pathway by which the Gulf Stream can affect the atmosphere locally, and possibly also in remote regions by forcing planetary waves(5,6). The identification of this pathway may have implications for our understanding of the processes involved in climate change, because the Gulf Stream is the upper limb of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation, which has varied in strength in the past(7) and is predicted to weaken in response to human- induced global warming in the future(8).","[Minobe, Shoshiro] Hokkaido Univ, Dept Nat Hist Sci, Grad Sch Sci, Sapporo, Hokkaido 0600810, Japan; [Kuwano-Yoshida, Akira; Komori, Nobumasa] Japan Agcy Marine Earth Sci & Technol, Earth Simulator Ctr, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2360001, Japan; [Xie, Shang-Ping; Small, Richard Justin] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Int Pacific Res Ctr, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; [Xie, Shang-Ping] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Dept Meteorol, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA","Minobe, S (reprint author), Hokkaido Univ, Dept Nat Hist Sci, Grad Sch Sci, Sapporo, Hokkaido 0600810, Japan.",minobe@sci.hokudai.ac.jp,"Minobe, Shoshiro/E-2997-2010; Xie, Shang-Ping/C-1254-2009; Komori, Nobumasa/D-1989-2013; Kuwano-Yoshida, Akira/I-8652-2014","Minobe, Shoshiro/0000-0002-9487-9006; Xie, Shang-Ping/0000-0002-3676-1325; Komori, Nobumasa/0000-0001-6067-8356; Kuwano-Yoshida, Akira/0000-0003-3151-8550",,,,33,273,290,10,84,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,13-Mar,2008,452,7184,,,,,206,U51,,10.1038/nature06690,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,273JG,WOS:000253925600038,18337820,No,Y,N,11/20/17

Theoretical and experimental studies have attempted to determine the mechanisms that generate this pattern over short timescales(1,2), but little attention has been given to the problem of understanding how diversity and productivity are linked over evolutionary timescales. Here, we investigate the role of dispersal in determining both diversity and productivity over evolutionary timescales, using experimental metacommunities of the bacterium Pseudomonas fluorescens assembled by divergent natural selection. We show that both regional diversity and productivity peak at an intermediate dispersal rate. Moreover, we demonstrate that these two patterns are linked: selection at intermediate rates of dispersal leads to high niche differentiation between genotypes, allowing greater coverage of the heterogeneous environment and a higher regional productivity. We argue that processes that operate over both ecological and evolutionary timescales should be jointly considered when attempting to understand the emergence of ecosystem- level properties such as diversity - function relationships.","[Venail, P.

Recent genomic studies in Arabidopsis thaliana have revealed that many endogenous genes are methylated either within their promoters or within their transcribed regions, and that gene methylation is highly correlated with transcription levels(3-5). However, plants have different types of methylation controlled by different genetic pathways, and detailed information on the methylation status of each cytosine in any given genome is lacking. To this end, we generated a map at single- base- pair resolution of methylated cytosines for Arabidopsis, by combining bisulphite treatment of genomic DNA with ultra- high- throughput sequencing using the Illumina 1G Genome Analyser and Solexa sequencing technology(6). This approach, termed BS- Seq, unlike previous microarray- based methods, allows one to sensitively measure cytosine methylation on a genome- wide scale within specific sequence contexts. Here we describe methylation on previously inaccessible components of the genome and analyse the DNA methylation sequence composition and distribution. We also describe the effect of various DNA methylation mutants on genome- wide methylation patterns, and demonstrate that our newly developed library construction and computational methods can be applied to large genomes such as that of mouse.","[Cokus, Shawn J.; Feng, Suhua; Zhang, Xiaoyu; Pellegrini, Matteo; Jacobsen, Steven E.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, David Geffen Sch Med, Dept Mol Cell & Dev Biol, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Feng, Suhua; Jacobsen, Steven E.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, David Geffen Sch Med, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Chen, Zugen; Merriman, Barry; Nelson, Stanley F.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, David Geffen Sch Med, Dept Human Genet, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Haudenschild, Christian D.] Illumina Inc, Hayward, CA 94545 USA; [Pradhan, Sriharsa] New England Biolabs Inc, Ipswich, MA 01938 USA","Jacobsen, SE (reprint author), Univ Calif Los Angeles, David Geffen Sch Med, Dept Mol Cell & Dev Biol, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.",matteop@mcdb.ucla.edu; jacobsen@ucla.edu,"Nelson, Stanley/D-4771-2009; jia, xu/A-8386-2016",,Howard Hughes Medical Institute,,,26,1015,1074,16,222,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,13-Mar,2008,452,7184,,,,,215,219,,10.1038/nature06745,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,273JG,WOS:000253925600040,18278030,No,Y,N,11/20/17

It is increasingly being realized that the neural code is adaptive(5), that is, sensory neurons change their responses and selectivity in a dynamic manner to match the changes in input stimuli(1,2,5). Understanding how rapid exposure, or adaptation, to a stimulus of fixed structure changes information processing by cortical networks is essential for understanding the relationship between sensory coding and behaviour(5-8). Physiological investigations of adaptation have contributed greatly to our understanding of how individual sensory neurons change their responses to influence stimulus coding(2,9-12), yet whether and how adaptation affects information coding in neural populations is unknown. Here we examine how brief adaptation ( on the timescale of visual fixation)(2,9,10) influences the structure of interneuronal correlations and the accuracy of population coding in the macaque ( Macaca mulatta) primary visual cortex ( V1). We find that brief adaptation to a stimulus of fixed structure reorganizes the distribution of correlations across the entire network by selectively reducing their mean and variability. The post- adaptation changes in neuronal correlations are associated with specific, stimulus- dependent changes in the efficiency of the population code, and are consistent with changes in perceptual performance after adaptation(2,13,14). Our results have implications beyond the predictions of current theories of sensory coding, suggesting that brief adaptation improves the accuracy of population coding to optimize neuronal performance during natural viewing.","[Gutnisky, Diego A.; Dragoi, Valentin] Univ Texas Houston, Sch Med, Dept Neurobiol & Anat, Houston, TX 77030 USA","Dragoi, V (reprint author), Univ Texas Houston, Sch Med, Dept Neurobiol & Anat, Houston, TX 77030 USA.",v.dragoi@uth.tmc.edu,"Gutnisky, Diego/E-3846-2012","Gutnisky, Diego/0000-0002-8578-0039",,,,32,142,142,0,25,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,13-Mar,2008,452,7184,,,,,220,U63,,10.1038/nature06563,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,273JG,WOS:000253925600041,18337822,No,,,11/20/17

Here, we show that microRNA- 203 is induced in the skin concomitantly with stratification and differentiation. By alteringmiR- 203' s spatiotemporal expression in vivo, we show that miR- 203 promotes epidermal differentiation by restricting proliferative potential and inducing cell- cycle exit. We identify p63 as one of the conserved targets of miR- 203 across vertebrates. Notably, p63 is an essential regulator of stem- cell maintenance in stratified epithelial tissues(4-9). We show that miR- 203 directly represses the expression of p63: it fails to switch off suprabasally when either Dicer1 or miR- 203 is absent and it becomes repressed basally when miR- 203 is prematurely expressed. Our findings suggest that miR- 203 defines a molecular boundary between proliferative basal progenitors and terminally differentiating suprabasal cells, ensuring proper identity of neighbouring layers.","[Yi, Rui; Fuchs, Elaine] Rockefeller Univ, Howard Hughes Med Inst, New York, NY 10065 USA; [Yi, Rui; Fuchs, Elaine] Rockefeller Univ, Lab Mammalian Cell Biol & Dev, New York, NY 10065 USA; [Poy, Matthew N.; Stoffel, Markus] ETH, Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Inst Mol Syst Biol, CH-8093 Zurich, Switzerland","Fuchs, E (reprint author), Rockefeller Univ, Howard Hughes Med Inst, New York, NY 10065 USA.",fuchslb@rockefeller.edu,"Poy, Matthew/F-6914-2017","Poy, Matthew/0000-0002-4904-2426; YI, RUI/0000-0002-6934-7091",Howard Hughes Medical Institute; NIAMS NIH HHS [R01 AR050452],,,30,452,482,1,24,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,13-Mar,2008,452,7184,,,,,225,U69,,10.1038/nature06642,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,273JG,WOS:000253925600042,18311128,No,,,11/20/17

This persistence of high lactate production by tumours in the presence of oxygen, known as aerobic glycolysis, was first noted by Otto Warburg more than 75 yr ago(1). How tumour cells establish this altered metabolic phenotype and whether it is essential for tumorigenesis is as yet unknown. Here we show that a single switch in a splice isoform of the glycolytic enzyme pyruvate kinase is necessary for the shift in cellular metabolism to aerobic glycolysis and that this promotes tumorigenesis. Tumour cells have been shown to express exclusively the embryonic M2 isoform of pyruvate kinase(2). Here we use short hairpin RNA to knockdown pyruvate kinase M2 expression in human cancer cell lines and replace it with pyruvate kinase M1. Switching pyruvate kinase expression to the M1 ( adult) isoform leads to reversal of the Warburg effect, as judged by reduced lactate production and increased oxygen consumption, and this correlates with a reduced ability to form tumours in nude mouse xenografts. These results demonstrate that M2 expression is necessary for aerobic glycolysis and that this metabolic phenotype provides a selective growth advantage for tumour cells in vivo.","[Christofk, Heather R.; Vander Heiden, Matthew G.; Cantley, Lewis C.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Syst Biol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Vander Heiden, Matthew G.] Dana Farber Canc Inst, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Harris, Marian H.; Fleming, Mark D.] Childrens Hosp, Dept Pathol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Ramanathan, Arvind; Gerszten, Robert E.; Wei, Ru; Schreiber, Stuart L.] Harvard Univ, Broad Inst, Chem Biol Program, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; [Ramanathan, Arvind; Gerszten, Robert E.; Wei, Ru; Schreiber, Stuart L.] MIT, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; [Gerszten, Robert E.] Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Div Cardiol, Boston, MA 02129 USA; [Gerszten, Robert E.] Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Ctr Immunol & Inflammatory Dis, Boston, MA 02129 USA; [Gerszten, Robert E.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Donald W Reynolds Cardiovasc Clin Res Ctr Atheros, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Schreiber, Stuart L.] Harvard Univ, Dept Chem & Chem Biol, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Cantley, Lewis C.] Beth Israel Deaconess Med Ctr, Div Signal Transduct, Boston, MA 02115 USA","Cantley, LC (reprint author), Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Syst Biol, Boston, MA 02115 USA.",lcantley@hms.harvard.edu,"Cantley, Lewis/D-1800-2014","Cantley, Lewis/0000-0002-1298-7653; Christofk, Heather/0000-0002-8662-4425",Howard Hughes Medical Institute; NCI NIH HHS [T32 CA009172]; NIGMS NIH HHS [R01 GM056203],,,19,1250,1302,15,212,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,13-Mar,2008,452,7184,,,,,230,U74,,10.1038/nature06734,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,273JG,WOS:000253925600043,18337823,No,Y,N,11/20/17

UNC93B1, essential for signalling of TLR3, TLR7 and TLR9 in both humans and mice, physically interacts with these TLRs in the endoplasmic reticulum ( ER)(4-6). Here we show that the function of the polytopic membrane protein UNC93B1 is to deliver the nucleotide- sensing receptors TLR7 and TLR9 from the ER to endolysosomes. In dendritic cells of 3d mice, which express an UNC93B1 missense mutant ( H412R) incapable of TLR binding, neither TLR7 nor TLR9 exits the ER. Furthermore, the trafficking and signalling defects of the nucleotide- sensing TLRs in 3d dendritic cells are corrected by expression of wild- type UNC93B1. However, UNC93B1 is dispensable for ligand recognition and signal initiation by TLRs. To our knowledge, UNC93B1 is the first protein to be identified as a molecule specifically involved in trafficking of nucleotide- sensing TLRs. By inhibiting the interaction between UNC93B1 and TLRs it should be possible to achieve specific regulation of the nucleotide- sensing TLRs without compromising signalling via the cell- surface- disposed TLRs.","[Kim, You-Me; Brinkmann, Melanie M.; Paquet, Marie-Eve; Ploegh, Hidde L.] Whitehead Inst Biomed Res, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA","Kim, YM (reprint author), Whitehead Inst Biomed Res, 9 Cambridge Ctr, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA.",ykim@wi.mit.edu; ploegh@wi.mit.edu,"Kim, You-Me/I-5553-2013","Kim, You-Me/0000-0001-8780-704X",,,,24,377,388,3,33,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,13-Mar,2008,452,7184,,,,,234,U80,,10.1038/nature06726,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,273JG,WOS:000253925600044,18305481,No,Y,N,11/20/17

The reductive branch to 4- methylpentanoate proceeds by means of the dehydration of ( R)- 2- hydroxy- 4- methylpentanoyl- CoA to 4- methylpent-2- enoyl- CoA, which is chemically the most demanding step. Ketyl radicals have been proposed(2) to mediate this reaction catalysed by an iron - sulphur- cluster- containing dehydratase, which requires activation by ATP- dependent electron transfer from a second iron - sulphur protein functionally similar to the iron protein of nitrogenase. Here we identify a kinetically competent product-related allylic ketyl radical bound to the enzyme by electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy employing isotope- labelled ( R)- 2- hydroxy- 4- methylpentanoyl- CoA species. We also found that the enzyme generated the stabilized pentadienoyl ketyl radical from the substrate analogue 2- hydroxypent- 4- enoyl- CoA, supporting the proposed mechanism. Our results imply that also other 2- hydroxyacyl- CoA dehydratases(3) and the related benzoyl- CoA reductases(4) - present in anaerobically living bacteria - employ ketyl radical intermediates. The absence of radical generators such as coenzyme B-12, S- adenosylmethionine or oxygen makes these enzymes unprecedented in biochemistry.","[Kim, Jihoe; Darley, Daniel J.; Buckel, Wolfgang; Pierik, Antonio J.] Univ Marburg, Fachbereich Biol, Mikrobiol Lab, D-35032 Marburg, Germany","Pierik, AJ (reprint author), Univ Marburg, Fachbereich Biol, Mikrobiol Lab, D-35032 Marburg, Germany.",pierik@staff.uni-marburg.de,"Pierik, Antonio/G-1108-2010","Pierik, Antonio/0000-0002-1509-6370",,,,26,34,34,2,23,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,13-Mar,2008,452,7184,,,,,239,U85,,10.1038/nature06637,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,273JG,WOS:000253925600045,18337824,No,,,11/20/17

Although studies on immunoglobulin and other loci have shown a correlation between positioning at the nuclear lamina and gene repression, the functional consequences of this compartmentalization remain untested(2,3). We devised an approach for inducible tethering of genes to the inner nuclear membrane ( INM), and tested the consequences of such repositioning on gene activity in mouse fibroblasts. Here, using three- dimensional DNA- immunoFISH, we demonstrate repositioning of chromosomal regions to the nuclear lamina that is dependent on breakdown and reformation of the nuclear envelope during mitosis. Moreover, tethering leads to the accumulation of lamin and INM proteins, but not to association with pericentro-meric heterochromatin or nuclear pore complexes. Recruitment of genes to the INM can result in their transcriptional repression. Finally, we use targeted adenine methylation ( DamID) to show that, as is the case for our model system, inactive immunoglobulin loci at the nuclear periphery are contacted by INM and lamina proteins. We propose that these molecular interactions may be used to compartmentalize and to limit the accessibility of immunoglobulin loci to transcription and recombination factors.","[Reddy, K.

The epigenome contains additional information that is not brought by DNA sequence, and generates spatial and functional constraints that complement genetic instructions. DNA methylation on CpGs constitutes an epigenetic mark generally correlated with transcriptionally silent condensed chromatin. Replication of methylation patterns by DNA methyltransferases maintains genome stability through cell division. Here we present evidence of an unanticipated dynamic role for DNA methylation in gene regulation in human cells. Periodic, strand- specific methylation/ demethylation occurs during transcriptional cycling of the pS2/TFF1 gene promoter on activation by oestrogens. DNA methyltransferases exhibit dual actions during these cycles, being involved in CpG methylation and active demethylation of (5m)CpGs through deamination. Inhibition of this process precludes demethylation of the pS2 gene promoter and its subsequent transcriptional activation. Cyclical changes in the methylation status of promoter CpGs may thus represent a critical event in transcriptional achievement.","[Metivier, Raphael; Gallais, Rozenn; Tiffoche, Christophe; Le Peron, Christine; Barath, Peter; Demay, Florence; Salbert, Gilles] Univ Rennes 1, CNRS, Equipe SPARTE,GFAS IFR 140, UMR 6026, F-35042 Rennes, France; [Jurkowska, Renata Z.; Jeltsch, Albert] Jacobs Univ Bremen, D-28759 Bremen, Germany; [Carmouche, Richard P.; Ibberson, David; Reid, George; Benes, Vladimir; Gannon, Frank] European Mol Biol Lab, D-69117 Heidelberg, Germany","Metivier, R (reprint author), Univ Rennes 1, CNRS, Equipe SPARTE,GFAS IFR 140, UMR 6026, Campus Beaulieu, F-35042 Rennes, France.",Raphael.Metivier@univ-rennes1.fr,"Jeltsch, Albert/O-7404-2014; Gannon, Frank/G-1194-2015; demay, florence/K-1881-2015","Jeltsch, Albert/0000-0001-6113-9290; Benes, Vladimir/0000-0002-0352-2547",,,,47,589,617,8,58,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,6-Mar,2008,452,7183,,,,,45,U2,,10.1038/nature06544,,8,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,269SZ,WOS:000253671900043,18322525,No,Y,N,11/20/17

In the oceans, where zinc is nearly depleted, diatoms use cadmium as a catalytic metal atom in cadmium carbonic anhydrase ( CDCA). Here we report the crystal structures of CDCA in four distinct forms: cadmium- bound, zinc- bound, metal- free and acetate- bound. Despite lack of sequence homology, CDCA is a structural mimic of a functional beta- carbonic anhydrase dimer, with striking similarity in the spatial organization of the active site residues. CDCA readily exchanges cadmium and zinc at its active site - an apparently unique adaptation to oceanic life that is explained by a stable opening of the metal coordinating site in the absence of metal. Given the central role of diatoms in exporting carbon to the deep sea, their use of cadmium in an enzyme critical for carbon acquisition establishes a remarkable link between the global cycles of cadmium and carbon.","[Morel, Francois M.

This important wave is known to remove(3-5) the high- energy electrons that are trapped along the Earth's magnetic field lines(6), and therefore helps to reduce the radiation hazards to satellites and humans in space. Numerous theories to explain the origin of hiss have been proposed over the past four decades, but none have been able to account fully for its observed properties. Here we show that a different wave type called chorus(7,8), previously thought to be unrelated to hiss, can propagate into the plasmasphere from tens of thousands of kilometres away, and evolve into hiss. Our new model naturally accounts for the observed frequency band of hiss, its incoherent nature, its day - night asymmetry in intensity, its association with solar activity and its spatial distribution. The connection between chorus and hiss is very interesting because chorus is instrumental in the formation of high- energy electrons outside the plasmasphere(9), whereas hiss depletes these electrons at lower equatorial altitudes(3,4).","[Bortnik, Jacob; Thorne, Richard M.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Atmospher & Ocean Sci, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Meredith, Nigel P.] British Antarctic Survey, NERC, Cambridge CB3 0ET, England","Bortnik, J (reprint author), Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Atmospher & Ocean Sci, 405 Hilgard Ave, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.",jbortnik@gmail.com,,"Meredith, Nigel/0000-0001-5032-3463",,,,30,149,149,1,16,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,6-Mar,2008,452,7183,,,,,62,66,,10.1038/nature06741,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,269SZ,WOS:000253671900046,18322528,No,,,11/20/17

In particular, scalable quantum networks require the capability to create, store and distribute entanglement among distant matter nodes by means of photonic channels(3). Atomic ensembles can play the role of such nodes(4). Sofar, in the photon- counting regime, heralded entanglement between atomic ensembles has been successfully demonstrated through probabilistic protocols(5,6). But an inherent drawback of this approach is the compromise between the amount of entanglement and its preparation probability, leading to intrinsically low count rates for high entanglement. Here we report a protocol where entanglement between two atomic ensembles is created by coherent mapping of an entangled state of light. By splitting a single photon(7-9) and performing subsequent state transfer, we separate the generation of entanglement and its storage(10). After a programmable delay, the stored entanglement is mapped back into photonic modes with overall efficiency of 17%. Together with improvements in single- photon sources(11), our protocol will allow 'on- demand' entanglement of atomic ensembles, a powerful resource for quantum information science.","[Choi, K.

Optomechanical systems in which this coupling is sufficiently strong are predicted to show quantum effects and are a topic of considerable interest. Devices in this regime would offer new types of control over the quantum state of both light and matter(1-4), and would provide a new arena in which to explore the boundary between quantum and classical physics(5-7). Experiments so far have achieved sufficient optomechanical coupling to laser- cool mechanical devices(8-12), but have not yet reached the quantum regime. The outstanding technical challenge in this field is integrating sensitive micromechanical elements ( which must be small, light and flexible) into high- finesse cavities ( which are typically rigid and massive) without compromising the mechanical or optical properties of either. A second, and more fundamental, challenge is to read out the mechanical element's energy eigenstate. Displacement measurements ( no matter how sensitive) cannot determine an oscillator's energy eigenstate(13), and measurements coupling to quantities other than displacement(14-16) have been difficult to realize in practice. Here we present an optomechanical system that has the potential to resolve both of these challenges. We demonstrate a cavity which is detuned by the motion of a 50-nm- thick dielectric membrane placed between two macroscopic, rigid, high- finesse mirrors. This approach segregates optical and mechanical functionality to physically distinct structures and avoids compromising either. It also allows for direct measurement of the square of the membrane's displacement, and thus in principle the membrane's energy eigenstate. We estimate that it should be practical to use this scheme to observe quantum jumps of a mechanical system, an important goal in the field of quantum measurement.","[Thompson, J. D.; Zwickl, B.

Polymer chain reorganization can be obtained by solvent exchange, one of the processing routes forming a simple hydrogel assembly. Nevertheless, many studies on hydrogel formation are empirical with a limited understanding of the mechanisms involved, delaying the processing of more complex structures. Here we use a multi- step interrupted gelation process in controlled physico- chemical conditions to generate complex hydrogels with multi- membrane 'onion-like' architectures. Our approach greatly simplifies the processing of gels with complex shapes and a multi- membrane organization.

Models for the geothermal gradient in stable crust predict a steady increase of temperature with depth. This thermal structure, however, is incompatible with observations from high- temperature metamorphic terranes exhumed in orogens(1,4,5,6). Global compilations(7) of peak conditions in high- temperature metamorphic terranes define relatively narrow ranges of peak temperatures over a wide range in pressure, for both isothermal decompression and isobaric cooling paths. Here we develop simple one- dimensional thermal models that include the effects of melt migration. These models show that long- lived plutonism results in a quasi- steady- state geotherm with a rapid temperature increase in the upper crust and nearly isothermal conditions in the middle and lower crust. The models also predict that the upward advection of heat by melt generates granulite facies metamorphism, and widespread andalusite - sillimanite metamorphism in the upper crust. Once the quasi- steady- state thermal profile is reached, the middle and lower crust are greatly weakened due to high temperatures and anatectic conditions, thus setting the stage for gravitational collapse(8), exhumation and isothermal decompression after the onset of plutonism. Near- iso-thermal conditions in the middle and lower crust result from the thermal buffering effect of dehydration melting reactions that, in part, control the shape of the geotherm.","[Depine, Gabriela V.; Andronicos, Christopher L.; Phipps-Morgan, Jason] Cornell Univ, Dept Earth & Atmospher Sci, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA","Depine, GV (reprint author), Cornell Univ, Dept Earth & Atmospher Sci, Snee Hall, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",gvd2@cornell.edu,,,,,,34,34,34,2,19,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,6-Mar,2008,452,7183,,,,,80,83,,10.1038/nature06689,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,269SZ,WOS:000253671900050,18322532,No,,,11/20/17

Yet many classes of theoretically possible dynamics are still poorly documented in nature. Here we study long- term time- series data of a midge, Tanytarsus gracilentus ( Diptera: Chironomidae), in Lake Myvatn, Iceland. The midge undergoes density fluctuations of almost six orders of magnitude. Rather than regular cycles, however, these fluctuations have irregular periods of 4 - 7 years, indicating complex dynamics. We fit three consumer - resource models capable of qualitatively distinct dynamics to the data. Of these, the best- fitting model shows alternative dynamical states in the absence of environmental variability; depending on the initial midge densities, the model shows either fluctuations around a fixed point or high- amplitude cycles. This explains the observed complex population dynamics: high-amplitude but irregular fluctuations occur because stochastic variability causes the dynamics to switch between domains of attraction to the alternative states. In the model, the amplitude of fluctuations depends strongly on minute resource subsidies into the midge habitat. These resource subsidies may be sensitive to human- caused changes in the hydrology of the lake, with human impacts such as dredging leading to higher- amplitude fluctuations.

Boreal, temperate and montane forests all depend on ectomycorrhizae(1). Identification of the primary factors that regulate symbiotic development and metabolic activity will therefore open the door to understanding the role of ectomycorrhizae in plant development and physiology, allowing the full ecological significance of this symbiosis to be explored. Here we report the genome sequence of the ectomycorrhizal basidiomycete Laccaria bicolor ( Fig. 1) and highlight gene sets involved in rhizosphere colonization and symbiosis. This 65- megabase genome assembly contains 20,000 predicted protein- encoding genes and a very large number of transposons and repeated sequences. We detected unexpected genomic features, most notably a battery of effector- type small secreted proteins ( SSPs) with unknown function, several of which are only expressed in symbiotic tissues. The most highly expressed SSP accumulates in the proliferating hyphae colonizing the host root. The ectomycorrhizae- specific SSPs probably have a decisive role in the establishment of the symbiosis. The unexpected observation that the genome of L. bicolor lacks carbohydrate- active enzymes involved in degradation of plant cell walls, but maintains the ability to degrade non- plant cell wall polysaccharides, reveals the dual saprotrophic and biotrophic lifestyle of the mycorrhizal fungus that enables it to grow within both soil and living plant roots. The predicted gene inventory of the L. bicolor genome, therefore, points to previously unknown mechanisms of symbiosis operating in biotrophic mycorrhizal fungi. The availability of this genome provides an unparalleled opportunity to develop a deeper understanding of the processes by which symbionts interact with plants within their ecosystem to perform vital functions in the carbon and nitrogen cycles that are fundamental to sustainable plant productivity.","[Martin, F.; Brun, A.; Duchaussoy, F.; Gibon, J.; Kohler, A.; Pereda, V.; Wuyts, J.; Blaudez, D.; Buee, M.; Cohen, D.; Courty, P.

Some antipsychotic drugs were identified by their high affinity for serotonin 5-HT2A receptors (2AR)(3,4). Drugs that interact with metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluR) also have potential for the treatment of schizophrenia(5-7). The effects of hallucinogenic drugs, such as psilocybin and lysergic acid diethylamide, require the 2AR(8-10) and resemble some of the core symptoms of schizophrenia(10-12). Here we show that the mGluR2 interacts through specific transmembrane helix domains with the 2AR, a member of an unrelated G- protein- coupled receptor family, to form functional complexes in brain cortex. The 2AR - mGluR2 complex triggers unique cellular responses when targeted by hallucinogenic drugs, and activation of mGluR2 abolishes hallucinogen- specific signalling and behavioural responses. In post- mortem human brain from untreated schizophrenic subjects, the 2AR is upregulated and the mGluR2 is downregulated, a pattern that could predispose to psychosis. These regulatory changes indicate that the 2AR mGluR2 complex may be involved in the altered cortical processes of schizophrenia, and this complex is therefore a promising new target for the treatment of psychosis.","[Gonzalez-Maeso, Javier; Ang, Rosalind L.; Yuen, Tony; Chan, Pokman; Okawa, Yuuya; Sealfon, Stuart C.] Mt Sinai Sch Med, Dept Neurol, New York, NY 10029 USA; [Gonzalez-Maeso, Javier] Mt Sinai Sch Med, Dept Psychiat, New York, NY 10029 USA; [Filizola, Marta] Mt Sinai Sch Med, Dept Struct & Chem Biol, New York, NY 10029 USA; [Sealfon, Stuart C.] Mt Sinai Sch Med, Ctr Translat Syst Biol, New York, NY 10029 USA; [Weisstaub, Noelia V.; Zhou, Mingming; Gingrich, Jay A.] Columbia Univ, Dept Psychiat, New York, NY 10032 USA; [Weisstaub, Noelia V.; Gingrich, Jay A.] Columbia Univ, Sackler Inst Labs, New York, NY 10032 USA; [Gingrich, Jay A.] Columbia Univ, Lieber Ctr Schizophrenia Res, New York, NY 10032 USA; New York State Psychiat Inst & Hosp, New York, NY 10032 USA; [Lopez-Gimenez, Juan F.; Milligan, Graeme] Univ Glasgow, Div Biochem & Mol Biol, Inst Biomed & Life Sci, Glasgow G12 8QQ, Lanark, Scotland; [Callado, Luis F.; Meana, J.

Suppression of apoptosis requires receptor signalling through the activation of Janus kinases and the subsequent regulation of members of the B- cell lymphoma 2 ( Bcl- 2) family. Here we demonstrate that a Bcl- 2- family- related protein, Hax1, is required to suppress apoptosis in lymphocytes and neurons. Suppression requires the interaction of Hax1 with the mitochondrial proteases Parl ( pre-senilin-associated, rhomboid- like) and HtrA2 ( high- temperature-regulated A2, also known as Omi). These interactions allow Hax1 to present HtrA2 to Parl, and thereby facilitates the processing of HtrA2 to the active protease localized in the mitochondrial intermembrane space. In mouse lymphocytes, the presence of processed HtrA2 prevents the accumulation of mitochondrial-outer-membrane- associated activated Bax, an event that initiates apoptosis. Together, the results identify a previously unknown sequence of interactions involving a Bcl- 2- family- related protein and mitochondrial proteases in the ability to resist the induction of apoptosis when cytokines are limiting.","[Chao, Jyh-Rong; Parganas, Evan; Hong, Cheol Yi; Opferman, Joseph T.; Ihle, James N.] St Jude Childrens Hosp, Dept Biochem, Memphis, TN 38105 USA; [Boyd, Kelli] St Jude Childrens Hosp, Anim Resources Ctr, Memphis, TN 38105 USA","Ihle, JN (reprint author), St Jude Childrens Hosp, Dept Biochem, 332 N Lauderdale St, Memphis, TN 38105 USA.",james.ihle@stjude.org,,,,,,27,144,146,1,10,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,6-Mar,2008,452,7183,,,,,98,U10,,10.1038/nature06604,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,269SZ,WOS:000253671900054,18288109,No,,,11/20/17

However, viruses also trigger pro- inflammatory responses(2), which remain poorly defined. Here we show that internalized adenoviral DNA induces maturation of pro- interleukin-1 beta in macrophages, which is dependent on NALP3 and ASC, components of the innate cytosolic molecular complex termed the inflammasome. Correspondingly, NALP3- and ASC- deficient mice display reduced innate inflammatory responses to adenovirus particles. Inflammasome activation also occurs as a result of transfected cytosolic bacterial, viral and mammalian ( host) DNA, but in this case sensing is dependent on ASC but not NALP3. The DNA- sensing pro- inflammatory pathway functions independently of TLRs and interferon regulatory factors. Thus, in addition to viral and bacterial components or danger signals in general, inflammasomes sense potentially dangerous cytoplasmic DNA, strengthening their central role in innate immunity.","[Petrilli, Virginie; Tschopp, Jurg] Univ Lausanne, Dept Biochem, CH-1066 Epalinges, Switzerland; [Muruve, Daniel A.; White, Lindsay R.; Clark, Sharon A.] Univ Calgary, Dept Med, Calgary, AB T2N 4N1, Canada; [Zaiss, Anne K.] Univ Calgary, Dept Biochem & Mol Biol, Calgary, AB T2N 4N1, Canada; [Ross, P.

In eubacteria, this complex process is initiated by a specialized transfer RNA charged with formylmethionine ( tRNA(fMet))(4-6). The amino- terminal formylated methionine of all bacterial nascent polypeptides blocks the reactive amino group to prevent unfavourable side- reactions and to enhance the efficiency of translation initiation(7,8). The first enzymatic factor that processes nascent chains is peptide deformylase ( PDF)(5,9-11); it removes this formyl group as polypeptides emerge from the ribosomal tunnel(12,13) and before the newly synthesized proteins can adopt their native fold, which may bury the N terminus. Next, the N-terminal methionine is excised by methionine aminopeptidase(14). Bacterial PDFs are metalloproteases sharing a conserved N- terminal catalytic domain. All Gram- negative bacteria, including Escherichia coli, possess class- 1 PDFs characterized by a carboxy- terminal alpha- helical extension(15). Studies focusing on PDF as a target for antibacterial drugs(14,16) have not revealed the mechanism of its co- translational mode of action despite indications in early work that it co- purifies with ribosomes(17). Here we provide biochemical evidence that E. coli PDF interacts directly with the ribosome via its C- terminal extension. Crystallographic analysis of the complex between the ribosome- interacting helix of PDF and the ribosome at 3.7 angstrom resolution reveals that the enzyme orients its active site towards the ribosomal tunnel exit for efficient co- translational processing of emerging nascent chains. Furthermore, we have found that the interaction of PDF with the ribosome enhances cell viability. These results provide the structural basis for understanding the coupling between protein synthesis and enzymatic processing of nascent chains, and offer insights into the interplay of PDF with the ribosome- associated chaperone trigger factor.","[Bingel-Erlenmeyer, Rouven; Kohler, Rebecca; Antolic, Snjezana; Maier, Timm; Schaffitzel, Christiane; Ban, Nenad] ETH, Inst Mol Biol & Biophys, CH-8093 Zurich, Switzerland; [Kramer, Guenter; Sandikci, Arzu; Bukau, Bernd] Univ Heidelberg, Zentrum Mol Biol ZMBH, D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany; [Wiedmann, Brigitte] Novartis Inst Biomed Res Inc, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA","Ban, N (reprint author), ETH, Inst Mol Biol & Biophys, CH-8093 Zurich, Switzerland.",ban@mol.biol.ethz.ch,"Maier, Timm/A-8835-2016","Maier, Timm/0000-0002-7459-1363; Berger-Schaffitzel, Christiane Helene/0000-0002-1516-9760",,,,37,57,57,2,23,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,6-Mar,2008,452,7183,,,,,108,U13,,10.1038/nature06683,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,269SZ,WOS:000253671900056,18288106,No,,,11/20/17

We reported previously that the proximal region of the trefoil factor 1 ( TFF1, also known as pS2) and oestrogen receptor alpha ( ER alpha) promoters could be partially methylated by treatment with deacetylase inhibitors(5), suggesting the possibility of dynamic changes in DNA methylation. Here we show that cyclical methylation and demethylation of CpG dinucleotides, with a periodicity of around 100 min, is characteristic for five selected promoters, including the oestrogen ( E2)- responsive pS2 gene, in human cells. When the pS2 gene is actively transcribed, DNA methylation occurs after the cyclical occupancy of ER alpha and RNA polymerase II ( polII).

APOBEC3G anti- viral activity is circumvented by most retroelements, such as through degradation by HIV-1 Vif(7). APOBEC3G is a member of a family of polynucleotide cytosine deaminases, several of which also target distinct physiological substrates. For instance, APOBEC1 edits APOB mRNA and AID deaminates antibody gene DNA(8-10). Although structures of other family members exist, none of these proteins has elicited polynucleotide cytosine deaminase or anti- viral activity(11-16). Here we report a solution structure of the human APOBEC3G catalytic domain. Five alpha- helices, including two that form the zinc- coordinating active site, are arranged over a hydrophobic platform consisting of five beta-strands. NMR DNA titration experiments, computational modelling, phylogenetic conservation and Escherichia coli- based activity assays combine to suggest a DNA-binding model in which a brim of positively charged residues positions the target cytosine for catalysis. The structure of the APOBEC3G catalytic domain will help us to understand functions of other family members and interactions that occur with pathogenic proteins such as HIV- 1 Vif.","[Chen, Kuan-Ming; Harjes, Elena; Gross, Phillip J.; Lu, Yongjian; Shindo, Keisuke; Harris, Reuben S.; Matsuo, Hiroshi] Univ Minnesota, Dept Biochem Mol Biol & Biophys, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA; [Chen, Kuan-Ming; Harjes, Elena; Gross, Phillip J.; Lu, Yongjian; Shindo, Keisuke; Harris, Reuben S.; Matsuo, Hiroshi] Univ Minnesota, Inst Mol Virol, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA; [Gross, Phillip J.; Shindo, Keisuke; Harris, Reuben S.] Univ Minnesota, Arnold & Mabel Beckman Ctr Genome Engn, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA; [Fahmy, Amr] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Biol Chem & Mol Pharmacol, Boston, MA 02115 USA","Matsuo, H (reprint author), Univ Minnesota, Dept Biochem Mol Biol & Biophys, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA.",rsh@umn.edu; matsu029@umn.edu,,"Shindo, Keisuke/0000-0001-8793-8189; Harjes, Elena/0000-0002-3643-9432",NIAID NIH HHS [R21 AI073167],,,53,141,150,0,14,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,6-Mar,2008,452,7183,,,,,116,U16,,10.1038/nature06638,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,269SZ,WOS:000253671900058,18288108,No,,,11/20/17

They form rarely because efficient radiative cooling keeps most star- forming gas clouds close to isothermal as they collapse, and this favours fragmentation into stars of one solar mass or lower(1-3). Heating of a cloud by accreting low- mass stars within it can prevent fragmentation and allow formation of massive stars(4,5), but the necessary properties for a cloud to form massive stars - and therefore where massive stars form in a galaxy - have not yet been determined. Here we show that only clouds with column densities of at least 1 g cm(-2) can avoid fragmentation and form massive stars. This threshold, and the environmental variation of the stellar initial mass function that it implies, naturally explain the characteristic column densities associated with massive star clusters(6-9) and the difference between the radial profiles of Ha and ultraviolet emission in galactic disks(10,11). The existence of a threshold also implies that the initial mass function should show detectable variation with environment within the Galaxy, that the characteristic column densities of clusters containing massive stars should vary between galaxies, and that star formation rates in some galactic environments may have been systematically underestimated.","[Krumholz, Mark R.] Princeton Univ, Dept Astrophys, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Krumholz, Mark R.] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Astrophys, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA; [McKee, Christopher F.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Phys, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [McKee, Christopher F.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Astron, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA","Krumholz, MR (reprint author), Princeton Univ, Dept Astrophys, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA.",krumholz@astro.princeton.edu,,,,,,30,171,171,0,2,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,28-Feb,2008,451,7182,,,,,1082,1084,,10.1038/nature06620,,3,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,266RB,WOS:000253453600036,18305539,No,,,11/20/17

Highly processable bulk metallic glasses ( BMGs) are a new class of engineering materials and have attracted significant technological interest(2-6). Although many BMGs exhibit high strength and show substantial fracture toughness, they lack ductility and fail in an apparently brittle manner in unconstrained loading geometries(7). For instance, some BMGs exhibit significant plastic deformation in compression or bending tests, but all exhibit negligible plasticity (<0.5% strain) in uniaxial tension. To overcome brittle failure in tension, BMG - matrix composites have been introduced(8,9). The inhomogeneous microstructure with isolated dendrites in a BMG matrix stabilizes the glass against the catastrophic failure associated with unlimited extension of a shear band and results in enhanced global plasticity and more graceful failure. Tensile strengths of similar to 1GPa, tensile ductility of similar to 2 - 3 per cent(9), and an enhanced mode I fracture toughness of K-1C approximate to 40 MPa m(1/2) were reported(8,9). Building on this approach, we have developed 'designed composites' by matching fundamental mechanical and microstructural length scales. Here, we report titanium zirconium- based BMG composites with room- temperature tensile ductility exceeding 10 per cent, yield strengths of 1.2 - 1.5 GPa, K-1C up to similar to 170 MPa m(1/)2, and fracture energies for crack propagation as high as G(1C)approximate to 340 kJ m(-2). The K-1C and G(1C) values equal or surpass those achievable in the toughest titanium or steel alloys, placing BMG composites among the toughest known materials.","[Hofmann, Douglas C.; Suh, Jin-Yoo; Wiest, Aaron; Duan, Gang; Lind, Mary-Laura; Demetriou, Marios D.; Johnson, William L.] CALTECH, Keck Lab Engn Mat, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA","Hofmann, DC (reprint author), CALTECH, Keck Lab Engn Mat, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA.",dch@caltech.edu,"Duan, Gang/B-3188-2009","Suh, Jin-Yoo/0000-0003-3786-6652",,,,29,740,764,55,531,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,28-Feb,2008,451,7182,,,,,1085,U3,,10.1038/nature06598,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,266RB,WOS:000253453600037,18305540,No,Y,N,11/20/17

Our understanding of these factors remains incomplete, however, owing to gaps in the record of monsoon history over the past two interglacial - glacial cycles. In particular, missing sections have hampered our ability to test ideas about orbital- scale controls on the monsoon(5-7), the causes of millennial- scale events(8,9) and relationships between changes in the monsoon and climate in other regions. Here we present an absolute- dated oxygen isotope record from Sanbao cave, central China, that completes a Chinese-cave-based record of the strength of the East Asian monsoon that covers the past 224,000 years. The record is dominated by 23,000-year- long cycles that are synchronous within dating errors with summer insolation at 65 degrees N ( ref. 10), supporting the idea that tropical/ subtropical monsoons respond dominantly and directly to changes in Northern Hemisphere summer insolation on orbital timescales(5). The cycles are punctuated by millennial- scale strong-summer-monsoon events ( Chinese interstadials(1)), and the new record allows us to identify the complete series of these events over the past two interglacial - glacial cycles. Their duration decreases and their frequency increases during glacial build- up in both the last and penultimate glacial periods, indicating that ice sheet size affects their character and pacing. The ages of the events are exceptionally well constrained and may thus serve as benchmarks for correlating and calibrating climate records.","[Wang, Yongjin; Cheng, Hai; Kong, Xinggong; Shao, Xiaohua; Chen, Shitao; Wu, Jiangyin; Jiang, Xiouyang] Nanjing Normal Univ, Coll Geog Sci, Jiangsu 210097, Peoples R China; [Cheng, Hai; Edwards, R.

Here we show that isotope geochemistry and seismic velocity anisotropy provide strong evidence for trench- parallel flow in the mantle wedge beneath Costa Rica and Nicaragua. This finding contradicts classical models, which predict trench- normal flow owing to the overlying wedge mantle being dragged downwards by the subducting plate. The isotopic signature of central Costa Rican volcanic rocks is not consistent with its derivation from the mantle wedge(1-3) or eroded fore- arc complexes(4) but instead from seamounts of the Galapagos hotspot track on the subducting Cocos plate. This isotopic signature decreases continuously from central Costa Rica to northwestern Nicaragua. As the age of the isotopic signature beneath Costa Rica can be constrained and its transport distance is known, minimum northwestward flow rates can be estimated ( 63 - 190 mm yr(-1)) and are comparable to the magnitude of subducting Cocos plate motion (similar to 85 mm yr(-1)).

The optimal search strategy they should use to maximize encounter rates with prey in heterogeneous natural environments remains a largely unresolved issue in ecology(1-3). Levy walks(4) are specialized random walks giving rise to fractal movement trajectories that may represent an optimal solution for searching complex landscapes(5). However, the adaptive significance of this putative strategy in response to natural prey distributions remains untested(6,7). Here we analyse over a million movement displacements recorded from animal- attached electronic tags to show that diverse marine predators - sharks, bony fishes, sea turtles and penguins - exhibit Levy- walk- like behaviour close to a theoretical optimum(2). Prey density distributions also display Levy- like fractal patterns, suggesting response movements by predators to prey distributions. Simulations show that predators have higher encounter rates when adopting Levy- type foraging in natural- like prey fields compared with purely random landscapes. This is consistent with the hypothesis that observed search patterns are adapted to observed statistical patterns of the landscape. This may explain why Levy- like behaviour seems to be widespread among diverse organisms(3), from microbes(8) to humans(9), as a `rule' that evolved in response to patchy resource distributions.","[Sims, David W.; Southall, Emily J.; Humphries, Nicolas E.; Wearmouth, Victoria J.] Marine Biol Assoc United Kingdom Lab, Plymouth PL1 2PB, Devon, England; [Sims, David W.] Univ Plymouth, Marine Biol & Ecol Res Ctr, Sch Biol Sci, Plymouth PL4 8AA, Devon, England; [Ahmed, Mohammed Z.] Univ Plymouth, Sch Comp Commun & Elect, Plymouth PL4 8AA, Devon, England; [Hays, Graeme C.; Shepard, Emily L.

Because predators would not be under selection to avoid the model and any of its look- alikes in areas where the model is absent ( that is, allopatry)(2-5), batesian mimics should occur only in sympatry with their model. However, contrary to this expectation, batesian mimics often occur in allopatry(6-8). Here we focus on one such example - a coral snake mimic(3,8). Using indirect DNA- based methods, we provide evidence suggesting that mimics migrate from sympatry, where mimicry is favoured(3,9), to allopatry, where it is disfavoured(10). Such gene flow is much stronger in nuclear genes than in maternally inherited mitochondrial genes, indicating that dispersal by males may explain the presence of mimetic phenotypes in allopatry. Despite this gene flow, however, individuals from allopatry resemble the model less than do individuals from sympatry. We show that this breakdown of mimicry probably reflects predator- mediated selection acting against individuals expressing the more conspicuous mimetic phenotype in allopatry. Thus, although gene flow may explain why batesian mimics occur in allopatry, natural selection may often override such gene flow and promote the evolution of non- mimetic phenotypes in such areas.","[Harper, George R., Jr.; Pfennig, David W.] Univ N Carolina, Dept Biol, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA","Pfennig, DW (reprint author), Univ N Carolina, Dept Biol, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA.",dpfennig@unc.edu,,,,,,29,28,29,2,40,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,28-Feb,2008,451,7182,,,,,1103,U6,,10.1038/nature06532,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,266RB,WOS:000253453600041,18305543,No,,,11/20/17

Several cheater mutants have been studied before, but no study has attempted a genome- scale investigation of the genetic opportunities for cheating. Here we describe such a screen in a social amoeba and show that cheating is multifaceted by revealing cheater mutations in well over 100 genes of diverse types. Many of these mutants cheat facultatively, producing more than their fair share of spores in chimaeras, but cooperating normally when clonal. These findings indicate that phenotypically stable cooperative systems may nevertheless harbour genetic conflicts. The opportunities for evolutionary moves and countermoves in such conflicts may select for the involvement of multiple pathways and numerous genes.","[Santorelli, Lorenzo A.; Kuspa, Adam; Strassmann, Joan E.; Queller, David C.; Shaulsky, Gad] Rice Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolut Biol, Houston, TX 77005 USA; [Thompson, Christopher R.

Here we show that resistance to PARP inhibition can be acquired by deletion of a mutation in BRCA2. We derived PARP- inhibitor- resistant ( PIR) clones from the human CAPAN1 pancreatic cancer cell line, which carries the protein- truncating c.6174delT frameshift mutation. PIR clones could form DNA- damage- induced RAD51 nuclear foci and were able to limit genotoxin- induced genomic instability, both hallmarks of a competent HR pathway. New BRCA2 isoforms were expressed in the resistant lines as a result of intragenic deletion of the c.6174delT mutation and restoration of the open reading frame ( ORF). Reconstitution of BRCA2- deficient cells with these revertant BRCA2 alleles rescued PARP inhibitor sensitivity and HR deficiency. Most of the deletions in BRCA2 were associated with small tracts of homology, and possibly arose from error-prone repair caused by BRCA2 deficiency(3,4). Similar ORF-restoring mutations were present in carboplatin- resistant ovarian tumours from c.6174delT mutation carriers. These observations have implications for understanding drug resistance in BRCA mutation carriers as well as in defining functionally important domains within BRCA2.","[Edwards, Stacey L.; Brough, Rachel; Lord, Christopher J.; Natrajan, Rachael; Vatcheva, Radost; Reis-Filho, Jorge S.; Ashworth, Alan] Inst Canc Res, Breakthrough Breast Canc Res Ctr, London SW3 6JB, England; [Levine, Douglas A.] Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Dept Surg, New York, NY 10021 USA; [Boyd, Jeff] Mem Hlth Univ Med Ctr, Anderson Canc Inst, Savannah, GA 31404 USA","Ashworth, A (reprint author), Inst Canc Res, Breakthrough Breast Canc Res Ctr, Fulham Rd, London SW3 6JB, England.",alan.ashworth@icr.ac.uk,"Lord, Christopher/B-3295-2012; Edwards, Stacey/A-4980-2011","Lord, Christopher/0000-0002-3226-0515; ",Cancer Research UK [A8363],,,30,485,493,2,42,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,28-Feb,2008,451,7182,,,,,1111,U8,,10.1038/nature06548,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,266RB,WOS:000253453600043,18264088,No,,,11/20/17

However, such carcinomas ultimately develop cisplatin resistance. The mechanism of that resistance is largely unknown(2). Here we show that acquired resistance to cisplatin can be mediated by secondary intragenic mutations in BRCA2 that restore the wildtype BRCA2 reading frame. First, in a cisplatin- resistant BRCA2-mutated breast- cancer cell line, HCC1428, a secondary genetic change in BRCA2 rescued BRCA2 function. Second, cisplatin selection of a BRCA2- mutated pancreatic cancer cell line, Capan- 1 ( refs 3, 4), led to five different secondary mutations that restored the wild- type BRCA2 reading frame. All clones with secondary mutations were resistant both to cisplatin and to a poly( ADP- ribose) polymerase ( PARP) inhibitor ( AG14361). Finally, we evaluated recurrent cancers from patients whose primary BRCA2- mutated ovarian carcinomas were treated with cisplatin. The recurrent tumour that acquired cisplatin resistance had undergone reversion of its BRCA2 mutation. Our results suggest that secondary mutations that restore the wild- type BRCA2 reading frame may be a major clinical mediator of acquired resistance to platinum- based chemotherapy.","[Sakai, Wataru; Friedman, Cynthia; Villegas, Emily; Jacquemont, Celine; Taniguchi, Toshiyasu] Fred Hutchinson Canc Res Ctr, Div Human Biol, Seattle, WA 98109 USA; [Sakai, Wataru; Villegas, Emily; Jacquemont, Celine; Urban, Nicole; Taniguchi, Toshiyasu] Fred Hutchinson Canc Res Ctr, Div Publ Hlth Sci, Seattle, WA 98109 USA; [Swisher, Elizabeth M.] Univ Washington, Dept Obstet & Gynecol, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Swisher, Elizabeth M.; Higgins, Jake] Univ Washington, Dept Med, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Karlan, Beth Y.] Cedars Sinai Med Ctr, Womens Canc Res Inst, Los Angeles, CA 90048 USA; [Agarwal, Mukesh K.; Farrugia, Daniel J.; Couch, Fergus J.] Mayo Clin, Dept Lab Med & Pathol, Rochester, MN 55905 USA; [Higgins, Jake] Univ Washington, Dept Genome Sci, Seattle, WA 98195 USA","Taniguchi, T (reprint author), Fred Hutchinson Canc Res Ctr, Div Human Biol, Seattle, WA 98109 USA.",ttaniguc@fhcrc.org,"Sakai, Wataru/J-6917-2012; Farrugia, Daniel/E-4752-2015",,"NCI NIH HHS [K08 CA096610, K08 CA096610-01, P50 CA083636, P50 CA083636-10, R01 CA125636, R01 CA125636-02]",,,39,452,463,3,38,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,28-Feb,2008,451,7182,,,,,1116,U9,,10.1038/nature06633,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,266RB,WOS:000253453600044,18264087,No,Y,N,11/20/17

The transfer of apomixis to crop plants holds great promise in plant breeding for fixation of heterozygosity and hybrid vigour because it would allow the propagation of hybrids over successive generations(1,2). Apomixis involves the production of unreduced ( diploid) female gametes that retain the genotype of the parent plant ( apomeiosis), followed by parthenogenetic development of the egg cell into an embryo and the formation of functional endosperm(3). The molecular mechanisms underlying apomixis are unknown. Here we show that mutation of the Arabidopsis gene DYAD/ SWITCH1 (SWI1)(4,5), a regulator of meiotic chromosome organization, leads to apomeiosis. We found that most fertile ovules in dyad plants form seeds that are triploid and that arise from the fertilization of an unreduced female gamete by a haploid male gamete. The unreduced female gametes fully retain parental heterozygosity across the genome, which is characteristic of apomeiosis. Our results show that the alteration of a single gene in a sexual plant can bring about functional apomeiosis, a major component of apomixis.","[Ravi, Maruthachalam; Marimuthu, Mohan P.

Despite this prominence, there is a dearth of functional knowledge regarding individual mammalian microRNAs. Using a loss- of- function allele in mice, we report here that the myeloid- specific microRNA- 223 ( miR- 223) negatively regulates progenitor proliferation and granulocyte differentiation and activation. miR- 223 ( also called Mirn223) mutant mice have an expanded granulocytic compartment resulting from a cell-autonomous increase in the number of granulocyte progenitors. We show that Mef2c, a transcription factor that promotes myeloid progenitor proliferation, is a target of miR- 223, and that genetic ablation of Mef2c suppresses progenitor expansion and corrects the neutrophilic phenotype in miR- 223 null mice. In addition, granulocytes lacking miR- 223 are hypermature, hypersensitive to activating stimuli and display increased fungicidal activity. As a consequence of this neutrophil hyperactivity, miR- 223 mutant mice spontaneously develop inflammatory lung pathology and exhibit exaggerated tissue destruction after endotoxin challenge. Our data support a model in which miR- 223 acts as a fine- tuner of granulocyte production and the inflammatory response.","[Johnnidis, Jonathan B.; Wheeler, Robert T.; Stehling-Sun, Sandra; Lam, Michael H.; Kirak, Oktay; Brummelkamp, Thijn R.; Camargo, Fernando D.] Whitehead Inst Biomed Res, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; [Harris, Marian H.; Fleming, Mark D.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Pathol, Childrens Hosp, Boston, MA 02115 USA","Camargo, FD (reprint author), Whitehead Inst Biomed Res, 9 Cambridge Ctr, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA.",camargo@wi.mit.edu,"Wheeler, Robert/B-9437-2013; Kirak, Oktay/H-6347-2013","Wheeler, Robert/0000-0003-3223-7021; Kirak, Oktay/0000-0002-6524-4685",,,,26,645,698,3,50,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,28-Feb,2008,451,7182,,,,,1125,U11,,10.1038/nature06607,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,266RB,WOS:000253453600046,18278031,No,Y,N,11/20/17
