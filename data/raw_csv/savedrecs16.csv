Whereas TMPRSS2 ERG fusions are predominant, fewer TMPRSS2-ETV1 cases have been identified than expected on the basis of the frequency of high (outlier) expression of ETV1 (refs 3-13). Here we explore the mechanism of ETV1 outlier expression in human prostate tumours and prostate cancer cell lines. We identified previously unknown 59 fusion partners in prostate tumours with ETV1 outlier expression, including untranslated regions from a prostate-specific androgen-induced gene (SLC45A3) and an endogenous retroviral element (HERV-K_22q11.23), a prostate-specific androgen-repressed gene (C15orf21), and a strongly expressed housekeeping gene (HNRPA2B1). To study aberrant activation of ETV1, we identified two prostate cancer cell lines, LNCaP and MDA-PCa 2B, that had ETV1 outlier expression. Through distinct mechanisms, the entire ETV1 locus (7p21) is rearranged to a 1.5-megabase prostate-specific region at 14q13.3-14q21.1 in both LNCaP cells (cryptic insertion) and MDA- PCa 2B cells (balanced translocation). Because the common factor of these rearrangements is aberrant ETV1 overexpression, we recapitulated this event in vitro and in vivo, demonstrating that ETV1 overexpression in benign prostate cells and in the mouse prostate confers neoplastic phenotypes. Identification of distinct classes of ETS gene rearrangements demonstrates that dormant oncogenes can be activated in prostate cancer by juxtaposition to tissue-specific or ubiquitously active genomic loci. Subversion of active genomic regulatory elements may serve as a more generalized mechanism for carcinoma development. Furthermore, the identification of androgen-repressed and insensitive 59 fusion partners may have implications for the anti-androgen treatment of advanced prostate cancer.","Univ Michigan, Sch Med, Michigan Ctr Translat Pathol, Dept Pathol, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; Univ Michigan, Sch Med, Dept Urol, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; Univ Michigan, Sch Med, Dept Internal Med, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; Univ Michigan, Sch Med, Ctr Comprehens Canc, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dana Farber Canc Inst, Boston, MA 02115 USA","Chinnaiyan, AM (reprint author), Univ Michigan, Sch Med, Michigan Ctr Translat Pathol, Dept Pathol, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",arul@umich.edu,"Cao, Qi/A-5517-2010","Cao, Qi/0000-0002-5140-3681; Rubin, Mark/0000-0002-8321-9950; Pienta, Kenneth/0000-0002-4138-2186",,,,34,474,484,4,27,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,2-Aug,2007,448,7153,,,,,595,U9,,10.1038/nature06024,,7,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,195XV,WOS:000248446700044,17671502,No,Y,N,11/20/17

Disorders of consciousness that persist for longer than 12 months after severe traumatic brain injury are generally considered to be immutable; no treatment has been shown to accelerate recovery or improve functional outcome in such cases(1,2). Recent studies have shown unexpected preservation of large-scale cerebral networks in patients in the minimally conscious state (MCS)(3,4), a condition that is characterized by intermittent evidence of awareness of self or the environment(5). These findings indicate that there might be residual functional capacity in some patients that could be supported by therapeutic interventions. We hypothesize that further recovery in some patients in the MCS is limited by chronic underactivation of potentially recruitable large-scale networks. Here, in a 6-month double-blind alternating crossover study, we show that bilateral deep brain electrical stimulation (DBS) of the central thalamus modulates behavioural responsiveness in a patient who remained in MCS for 6 yr following traumatic brain injury before the intervention. The frequency of specific cognitively mediated behaviours (primary outcome measures) and functional limb control and oral feeding (secondary outcome measures) increased during periods in which DBS was on as compared with periods in which it was off. Logistic regression modelling shows a statistical linkage between the observed functional improvements and recent stimulation history. We interpret the DBS effects as compensating for a loss of arousal regulation that is normally controlled by the frontal lobe in the intact brain. These findings provide evidence that DBS can promote significant late functional recovery from severe traumatic brain injury. Our observations, years after the injury occurred, challenge the existing practice of early treatment discontinuation for patients with only inconsistent interactive behaviours and motivate further research to develop therapeutic interventions.","Weill Cornell Med Coll, Dept Neurol & Neurosci, New York, NY 10021 USA; JFK Rehabil Inst, Edison, NJ 08818 USA; New Jersey Neurosci Inst, Edison, NJ 08818 USA; Cleveland Clin Fdn, Ctr Neurol Restorat, Cleveland, OH 44195 USA; Weill Cornell Med Coll, Div Med Eth, New York, NY 10021 USA","Schiff, ND (reprint author), Weill Cornell Med Coll, Dept Neurol & Neurosci, New York, NY 10021 USA.",nds2001@mail.med.cornell.edu,"Victor, Jonathan/D-2931-2009; Machado, Andre/B-7572-2014","Machado, Andre/0000-0002-8132-5610",,,,23,385,402,9,61,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,2-Aug,2007,448,7153,,,,,600,U10,,10.1038/nature06041,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,195XV,WOS:000248446700045,17671503,No,Y,N,11/20/17

However, stimulating or perturbing the intracellular network often causes distinct phenotypes that are specific to a given cell type(4,5). This 'cell specificity' presents a challenge in understanding how intracellular networks regulate cell behaviour and an obstacle to developing drugs that treat signalling dysfunctions(6,7). Here we apply a systems-modelling approach(8) to investigate how cell-specific signalling events are integrated through effector proteins to cause cell-specific outcomes. We focus on the synergy between tumour necrosis factor and an adenoviral vector as a therapeutically relevant stimulus that induces cell-specific responses(9-11). By constructing models that estimate how kinase-signalling events are processed into phenotypes through effector substrates, we find that accurate predictions of cell specificity are possible when different cell types share a common 'effector-processing' mechanism. Partial-least-squares regression models based on common effector processing accurately predict cell-specific apoptosis, chemokine release, gene induction, and drug sensitivity across divergent epithelial cell lines. We conclude that cell specificity originates from the differential activation of kinases and other upstream transducers, which together enable different cell types to use common effectors to generate diverse outcomes. The common processing of network signals by downstream effectors points towards an important cell biological principle, which can be applied to the understanding of cell-specific responses to targeted drug therapies(6).","MIT, Ctr Cell Decis Proc, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; MIT, Dept Chem Engn, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Cell Biol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; MIT, Dept Biol, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; MIT, Dept Biol Engn, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA","Lauffenburger, DA (reprint author), MIT, Ctr Cell Decis Proc, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",lauffen@mit.edu,,,,,,34,119,125,1,8,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,2-Aug,2007,448,7153,,,,,604,U11,,10.1038/nature06001,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,195XV,WOS:000248446700046,17637676,No,,,11/20/17

LTC4 synthase (LTC4S), the pivotal enzyme for the biosynthesis of LTC4 (ref. 10), is an 18-kDa integral nuclear membrane protein(11,12) that belongs to a superfamily of membrane-associated proteins in eicosanoid and glutathione metabolism that includes 5-lipoxygenase- activating protein, microsomal glutathione S-transferases (MGSTs), and microsomal prostaglandin E synthase 1 (ref. 13). LTC4S conjugates glutathione to LTA(4), the endogenous substrate derived from arachidonic acid through the 5-lipoxygenase pathway(14). In contrast with MGST2 and MGST3 (refs 15, 16), LTC4S does not conjugate glutathione to xenobiotics(17). Here we show the atomic structure of human LTC4S in a complex with glutathione at 3.3 angstrom resolution by X-ray crystallography and provide insights into the high substrate specificity for glutathione and LTA(4) that distinguishes LTC4S from other MGSTs. The LTC4S monomer has four transmembrane alpha-helices and forms a threefold symmetric trimer as a unit with functional domains across each interface. Glutathione resides in a U-shaped conformation within an interface between adjacent monomers, and this binding is stabilized by a loop structure at the top of the interface. LTA(4) would fit into the interface so that Arg 104 of one monomer activates glutathione to provide the thiolate anion that attacks C6 of LTA(4) to form a thioether bond, and Arg 31 in the neighbouring monomer donates a proton to form a hydroxyl group at C5, resulting in 5(S)-hydroxy-6(R)-S-glutathionyl-7,9-trans-11,14-cis-eicosatetraenoic acid (LTC4). These findings provide a structural basis for the development of LTC4S inhibitors for a proinflammatory pathway mediated by three cysteinyl leukotriene ligands whose stability and potency are different and by multiple cysteinyl leukotriene receptors whose functions may be non-redundant.","Harima Inst, Struct Biophys Lab, RIKEN SPring Ctr 8, Sayo, Hyogo 6795148, Japan; Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Med, Boston, MA 02115 USA; Brigham & Womens Hosp, Div Rheumatol Immunol & Allergy, Boston, MA 02115 USA","Miyano, M (reprint author), Harima Inst, Struct Biophys Lab, RIKEN SPring Ctr 8, 1-1-1 Kouto, Sayo, Hyogo 6795148, Japan.",fausten@rics.bwh.harvard.edu; miyano@spring8.or.jp,"Miyano, Masashi/R-2785-2016",,,,,31,105,108,0,10,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,2-Aug,2007,448,7153,,,,,609,U12,,10.1038/nature05936,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,195XV,WOS:000248446700047,17632548,No,,,11/20/17

In the biosynthesis of cysteinyl leukotrienes, conversion of arachidonic acid forms the unstable epoxide leukotriene A(4) (LTA(4)). This intermediate is conjugated with glutathione (GSH) to produce leukotriene C-4 (LTC4) in a reaction catalysed by LTC4 synthase(1): this reaction is the key step in cysteinyl leukotriene formation. Here we present the crystal structure of the human LTC4 synthase in its apo and GSH- complexed forms to 2.00 and 2.15 angstrom resolution, respectively. The structure reveals a homotrimer, where each monomer is composed of four transmembrane segments. The structure of the enzyme in complex with substrate reveals that the active site enforces a horseshoe- shaped conformation on GSH, and effectively positions the thiol group for activation by a nearby arginine at the membrane - enzyme interface. In addition, the structure provides a model for how the omega- end of the lipophilic co- substrate is pinned at one end of a hydrophobic cleft, providing a molecular 'ruler' to align the reactive epoxide at the thiol of glutathione. This provides newstructural insights into themechanismof LTC4 formation, and also suggests that the observed binding and activation of GSHmight be common for a family of homologous proteins important for inflammatory and detoxification responses.","Karolinska Inst, Div Biophys, Dept Med Biochem & Biophys, S-17177 Stockholm, Sweden; Karolinska Inst, Div Chem, Dept Med Biochem & Biophys, S-17177 Stockholm, Sweden; Karolinska Inst, Struct Genom Consortium, S-17177 Stockholm, Sweden; Stockholm Univ, Dept Biochem & Biophys, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden; European Mol Biol Lab, Grenoble Outstn, F-38042 Grenoble 9, France","Haeggstrom, J (reprint author), Karolinska Inst, Div Biophys, Dept Med Biochem & Biophys, S-17177 Stockholm, Sweden.",said.eshaghi@ki.se; jesper.haeggstrom@ki.se; par.nordlund@ki.se,,,,,,28,120,121,0,4,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,2-Aug,2007,448,7153,,,,,613,U13,,10.1038/nature06009,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,195XV,WOS:000248446700048,,No,,,11/20/17

Here we report the identification of a somatic mutation in human breast, colorectal and ovarian cancers that results in a glutamic acid to lysine substitution at amino acid 17 (E17K) in the lipid-binding pocket of AKT1. Lys 17 alters the electrostatic interactions of the pocket and forms new hydrogen bonds with a phosphoinositide ligand. This mutation activates AKT1 by means of pathological localization to the plasma membrane, stimulates downstream signalling, transforms cells and induces leukaemia in mice. This mechanism indicates a direct role of AKT1 in human cancer, and adds to the known genetic alterations that promote oncogenesis through the phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase/AKT pathway. Furthermore, the E17K substitution decreases the sensitivity to an allosteric kinase inhibitor, so this mutation may have important clinical utility for AKT drug development.","Lilly Corp Ctr, Lilly Res Labs, Canc Discovery Res, Indianapolis, IN 46285 USA; Translat Genom Res Inst, Div Integrated Canc Genom, Phoenix, AZ 85004 USA; Lilly Corp Ctr, Lilly Res Labs, Global Struct Biol, Indianapolis, IN 46285 USA; Lilly Corp Ctr, Lilly Res Labs, Integrat Biol, Indianapolis, IN 46285 USA; Lilly Singapore, Ctr Drug Discovery, Singapore 117528, Singapore; Translat Genom Res Inst, Scottsdale, AZ 85259 USA","Blanchard, KL (reprint author), Lilly Corp Ctr, Lilly Res Labs, Canc Discovery Res, Indianapolis, IN 46285 USA.",kblanc@lilly.com; thomas_james_e@lilly.com,"Tucker-Kellogg, Greg/G-3344-2012","Tucker-Kellogg, Greg/0000-0001-8407-9251",,,,37,711,723,1,49,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,26-Jul,2007,448,7152,,,,,439,U1,,10.1038/nature05933,,7,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,193VG,WOS:000248302700040,17611497,No,Y,N,11/20/17

Depletion of c-Myc from mammalian ( human and mouse) cells as well as from Xenopus cell-free extracts, which are devoid of RNA transcription, demonstrates a non-transcriptional role for c-Myc in the initiation of DNA replication.

Many quantum information processing schemes require the manipulation and deterministic entanglement of individual qubits; this would typically be accomplished using controlled, state-dependent, coherent interactions among qubits. Recent experiments have made progress towards this goal by demonstrating entanglement among an ensemble of atoms(1) confined in an optical lattice. Until now, however, there has been no demonstration of a key operation: controlled entanglement between atoms in isolated pairs. Here we use an optical lattice of double-well potentials(2,3) to isolate and manipulate arrays of paired Rb-87 atoms, inducing controlled entangling interactions within each pair. Our experiment realizes proposals to use controlled exchange coupling(4) in a system of neutral atoms(5). Although Rb-87 atoms have nearly state-independent interactions, when we force two atoms into the same physical location, the wavefunction exchange symmetry of these identical bosons leads to state-dependent dynamics. We observe repeated interchange of spin between atoms occupying different vibrational levels, with a coherence time of more than ten milliseconds. This observation demonstrates the essential component of a neutral atom quantum SWAP gate ( which interchanges the state of two qubits). Its 'half-implementation', the root SWAP gate, is entangling, and together with single-qubit rotations it forms a set of universal gates for quantum computation(4).","Univ Maryland, Natl Inst Stand & Technol, Joint Quantum Inst, Gaithersburg, MD 20899 USA","Porto, JV (reprint author), Univ Maryland, Natl Inst Stand & Technol, Joint Quantum Inst, Gaithersburg, MD 20899 USA.",trey@nist.gov,"Lee, Patricia/B-6146-2012","Brown, Benjamin/0000-0002-4873-6362",,,,29,247,248,2,38,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,26-Jul,2007,448,7152,,,,,452,456,,10.1038/nature06011,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,193VG,WOS:000248302700042,17653187,No,Y,N,11/20/17

Its combination of macroscopic flexibility and stiffness is a result of a unique interlocking-tile arrangement of the nanoscale graphene oxide sheets.","Northwestern Univ, Dept Mech Engn, Evanston, IL 60208 USA; Northwestern Univ, Dept Phys & Astron, Evanston, IL 60208 USA; Northwestern Univ, Dept Chem, Evanston, IL 60208 USA","Ruoff, RS (reprint author), Northwestern Univ, Dept Mech Engn, 2145 Sheridan Rd, Evanston, IL 60208 USA.",r-ruoff@northwestern.edu,"Dikin, Dmitriy/B-7592-2009; Ruoff, Rodney/B-7605-2009; Dikin, Dmitriy/A-1086-2010; Dikin, Dmitriy/B-4649-2014; Nguyen, SonBinh/C-1682-2014; Ruoff, Rodney/K-3879-2015","Dikin, Dmitriy/0000-0001-8100-4502; Dikin, Dmitriy/0000-0001-8100-4502; Nguyen, SonBinh/0000-0002-6977-3445; ",,,,27,2851,2916,370,4266,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,26-Jul,2007,448,7152,,,,,457,460,,10.1038/nature06016,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,193VG,WOS:000248302700043,17653188,No,Y,N,11/20/17

Human-induced changes have not, however, previously been detected in precipitation at the global scale(10-12), partly because changes in precipitation in different regions cancel each other out and thereby reduce the strength of the global average signal(13-19). Models suggest that anthropogenic forcing should have caused a small increase in global mean precipitation and a latitudinal redistribution of precipitation, increasing precipitation at high latitudes, decreasing precipitation at sub-tropical latitudes(15,18,19), and possibly changing the distribution of precipitation within the tropics by shifting the position of the Intertropical Convergence Zone(20). Here we compare observed changes in land precipitation during the twentieth century averaged over latitudinal bands with changes simulated by fourteen climate models. We show that anthropogenic forcing has had a detectable influence on observed changes in average precipitation within latitudinal bands, and that these changes cannot be explained by internal climate variability or natural forcing. We estimate that anthropogenic forcing contributed significantly to observed increases in precipitation in the Northern Hemisphere mid-latitudes, drying in the Northern Hemisphere subtropics and tropics, and moistening in the Southern Hemisphere subtropics and deep tropics. The observed changes, which are larger than estimated from model simulations, may have already had significant effects on ecosystems, agriculture and human health in regions that are sensitive to changes in precipitation, such as the Sahel.","Environm Canada, Div Climate Res, Toronto, ON M3H 5T4, Canada; Duke Univ, Nicholas Sch Environm & Earth Sci, Durham, NC 27708 USA; Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Geog, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; Univ E Anglia, Climat Res Unit, Sch Environm Sci, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England; NOAA, Earth Syst Res Lab, Boulder, CO 80305 USA; Univ Reading, Met Off, Hadley Ctr, Reading Unit, Reading RG6 6BB, Berks, England; Natl Inst Environm Studies, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058506, Japan","Zwiers, FW (reprint author), Environm Canada, Div Climate Res, Toronto, ON M3H 5T4, Canada.",francis.zwiers@ec.gc.ca,"Stott, Peter/N-1228-2016; Manager, CSD Publications/B-2789-2015","Stott, Peter/0000-0003-4853-7686; ",,,,31,486,524,23,234,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,26-Jul,2007,448,7152,,,,,461,U4,,10.1038/nature06025,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,193VG,WOS:000248302700044,17646832,No,Y,N,11/20/17

An important structural classification of rifts is by width(1), with narrow rifts thought to form as necking instabilities(2) ( where extension rates outpace thermal diffusion(3)) and wide rifts thought to require a mechanism to inhibit localization, such as lower-crustal flow in high heat-flow settings(1,4). Observations of the magmatism that results from rifting range from volcanic margins with two to three times the magmatism predicted from melting models(5) to non-volcanic margins with almost no rift or post-rift magmatism. Such variations in magmatic activity are commonly attributed to variations in mantle temperature. Here we describe results from the PESCADOR seismic experiment in the southern Gulf of California and present crustal-scale images across three rift segments. Over short lateral distances, we observe large differences in rifting style and magmatism - from wide rifting with minor synchronous magmatism to narrow rifting in magmatically robust segments. But many of the factors believed to control structural evolution and magmatism during rifting ( extension rate, mantle potential temperature and heat flow) tend to vary over larger length scales. We conclude instead that mantle depletion, rather than low mantle temperature, accounts for the observed wide, magma-poor margins, and that mantle fertility and possibly sedimentary insulation, rather than high mantle temperature, account for the observed robust rift and post-rift magmatism.","Woods Hole Oceanog Inst, Dept Geol & Geophys, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA; New Mexico Inst Min & Technol, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, Socorro, NM 87801 USA; Univ Wyoming, Dept Geol & Geophys, Laramie, WY 82071 USA; Ctr Invest Cient & Educ Ensenada, Dept Geol, Ensenada 22860, Baja California, Mexico; Scripps Inst Oceanog, Inst Geophys & Planetary Phys, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; No Arizona Univ, Dept Geol, Flagstaff, AZ 86011 USA; BP Explorat Operating Co Ltd, Sunbury On Thames TW16 7LN, Middx, England","Lizarralde, D (reprint author), Woods Hole Oceanog Inst, Dept Geol & Geophys, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA.",danl@whoi.edu,"Holbrook, W.

We characterized more than 317,000 SNPs in DNA from 994 patients with childhood onset asthma and 1,243 non-asthmatics, using family and case-referent panels. Here we show multiple markers on chromosome 17q21 to be strongly and reproducibly associated with childhood onset asthma in family and case-referent panels with a combined P value of P < 10(-12). In independent replication studies the 17q21 locus showed strong association with diagnosis of childhood asthma in 2,320 subjects from a cohort of German children (P=0.0003) and in 3,301 subjects from the British 1958 Birth Cohort (P=0.0005). We systematically evaluated the relationships between markers of the 17q21 locus and transcript levels of genes in Epstein - Barr virus (EBV)-transformed lymphoblastoid cell lines from children in the asthma family panel used in our association study. The SNPs associated with childhood asthma were consistently and strongly associated (P < 10(-22)) in cis with transcript levels of ORMDL3, a member of a gene family that encodes transmembrane proteins anchored in the endoplasmic reticulum(3). The results indicate that genetic variants regulating ORMDL3 expression are determinants of susceptibility to childhood asthma.","Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Natl Heart & Lung Inst, London SW3 6LY, England; Univ Munich, Childrens Hosp, D-80337 Munich, Germany; Univ Michigan, Dept Biostat, Ctr Stat Genet, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; Univ Oxford, Wellcome Trust, Ctr Human Genet, Oxford OX3 7BN, England; Univ London, Div Community Hlth Sci, London SW17 0RE, England; CEA, Ctr Natl Genotypage, Inst Genom, F-91057 Evry, France; Marien Hosp, Res Inst Prevent Allerg Dis, Childrens Dept, D-46483 Wesel, Germany; Ruhr Univ Bochum, Dept Expt Pneumol, D-44789 Bochum, Germany; Univ Cologne, Childrens Hosp, D-50924 Cologne, Germany; Univ Freiburg, Childrens Hosp, D-79106 Freiburg, Germany; Feldkirch Hosp, Childrens Dept, A-6800 Feldkirch, Austria; Univ Vienna, Childrens Hosp, A-1090 Vienna, Austria; GSF, Res Ctr Environm & Hlth, Inst Epidemiol, D-85764 Neuherberg, Germany; Tech Univ Dresden, Childrens Hosp, S-01307 Dresden, Germany; Univ Ulm, Inst Epidemiol, D-89081 Ulm, Germany","Cookson, WOC (reprint author), Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Natl Heart & Lung Inst, London SW3 6LY, England.",w.cookson@imperial.ac.uk,"Abecasis, Goncalo/B-7840-2010; Heath, Simon/J-4138-2012","Bufe, Albrecht/0000-0001-7335-9362; von Mutius, Erika/0000-0002-8893-4515; Abecasis, Goncalo/0000-0003-1509-1825",Medical Research Council [G0000934]; Wellcome Trust,,,22,837,886,3,58,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,26-Jul,2007,448,7152,,,,,470,U5,,10.1038/nature06014,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,193VG,WOS:000248302700046,17611496,No,Y,N,11/20/17

This crystallin has anti-apoptotic(2-7) and neuroprotective(8) functions. CRYAB is the major target of CD4(+) T-cell immunity to the myelin sheath from multiple sclerosis brain(9,10). The pathophysiological implications of this immune response were investigated here. We demonstrate that CRYAB is a potent negative regulator acting as a brake on several inflammatory pathways in both the immune system and central nervous system (CNS). Cryab(-/-) mice showed worse experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) at the acute and progressive phases, with higher Th1 and Th17 cytokine secretion from T cells and macrophages, and more intense CNS inflammation, compared with their wild-type counterparts. Furthermore, Cryab(-/-) astrocytes showed more cleaved caspase-3 and more TUNEL staining, indicating an anti-apoptotic function of Cryab. Antibody to CRYAB was detected in cerebrospinal fluid from multiple sclerosis patients and in sera from mice with EAE. Administration of recombinant CRYAB ameliorated EAE. Thus, the immune response against a negative regulator of inflammation, CRYAB, in multiple sclerosis, would exacerbate inflammation and demyelination. This can be countered by giving CRYAB itself for therapy of ongoing disease.","Stanford Univ, Dept Neurol & Neurol Sci, Sch Med, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; Stanford Univ, Div Rheumatol & Immunol, Sch Med, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; Vet Affairs Palo Alto Hlth Care Syst, Lab Serv, Palo Alto, CA 94304 USA; Vet Affairs Palo Alto Hlth Care Syst, GRECC, Palo Alto, CA 94304 USA; TNO Qual Life, Dept Biosci, NL-2301 CE Leiden, Netherlands; NEI, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; Harvard Univ, Brigham & Womens Hosp, Sch Med, Ctr Neurol Dis, Boston, MA 02115 USA","Steinman, L (reprint author), Stanford Univ, Dept Neurol & Neurol Sci, Sch Med, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",steinman@stanford.edu,"Wawrousek, Eric/A-4547-2008","van Noort, Johannes/0000-0002-9060-5921",Multiple Sclerosis Society [835],,,30,298,308,0,20,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,26-Jul,2007,448,7152,,,,,474,U7,,10.1038/nature05935,,8,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,193VG,WOS:000248302700047,17568699,No,,,11/20/17

During this differentiation, T(H)1 and T(H)2 cells produce interferon-gamma and interleukin (IL)-4, respectively, as autocrine factors necessary for selective lineage commitment. A distinct T-H subset, termed THIL-17, T(H)17 or inflammatory T-H (T(H)i), has been recently identified as a distinct T-H lineage mediating tissue inflammation(3,4). T(H)17 differentiation is initiated by transforming growth factor-beta and IL-6 (refs 5 - 7) and reinforced by IL-23 ( ref. 8), in which signal transduction and activators of transcription ( STAT) 3 and retinoic acid receptor-related orphan receptor (ROR)-gamma mediate the lineage specification(8-10). T(H)17 cells produce IL-17, IL-17F and IL-22, all of which regulate inflammatory responses by tissue cells but have no importance in T(H)17 differentiation(11-14). Here we show that IL-21 is another cytokine highly expressed by mouse T(H)17 cells. IL-21 is induced by IL-6 in activated T cells, a process that is dependent on STAT3 but not ROR-gamma. IL-21 potently induces T(H)17 differentiation and suppresses Foxp3 expression, which requires STAT3 and ROR-gamma, which is encoded by Rorc. IL-21 deficiency impairs the generation of T(H)17 cells and results in protection against experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. IL-21 is therefore an autocrine cytokine that is sufficient and necessary for T(H)17 differentiation, and serves as a target for treating inflammatory diseases.","Univ Texas, MD Anderson Canc Ctr, Dept Immunol, Houston, TX 77030 USA; Inst Syst Engn, Seattle, WA 98103 USA; NIEHS, Cell Biol Sect, LRB, NIH, Res Triangle Pk, NC 27709 USA","Nurieva, R (reprint author), Univ Texas, MD Anderson Canc Ctr, Dept Immunol, 1515 Holcombe Blvd, Houston, TX 77030 USA.",rnurieva@mdanderson.org; cdong@mdanderson.org,"dong, chen /B-3181-2009","dong, chen /0000-0002-0084-9130; Martinez, Gustavo/0000-0003-0178-3329; Watowich, Stephanie/0000-0003-1969-659X; Jetten, Anton/0000-0003-0954-4445",Intramural NIH HHS,,,28,954,1028,3,39,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,26-Jul,2007,448,7152,,,,,480,U8,,10.1038/nature05969,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,193VG,WOS:000248302700048,17581589,No,Y,N,11/20/17

Recently a subset of T cells, distinct from T helper (T-H) 1 and T(H)2 cells, producing interleukin (IL)-17 (T(H)17) was defined and seems to have a crucial role in mediating autoimmunity and inducing tissue inflammation(2-5). We and others have shown that transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta and IL-6 together induce the differentiation of T(H)17 cells, in which IL-6 has a pivotal function in dictating whether T cells differentiate into Foxp3(+) regulatory T cells (T-reg cells) or T(H)17 cells(6-9). Whereas TGF-beta induces Foxp3 and generates T-reg cells, IL-6 inhibits the generation of T-reg cells and induces the production of IL-17, suggesting a reciprocal developmental pathway for T(H)17 and T-reg cells. Here we show that IL-6-deficient (Il6(-/-)) mice do not develop a T(H)17 response and their peripheral repertoire is dominated by Foxp3(+) T-reg cells. However, deletion of T-reg cells leads to the reappearance of T(H)17 cells in Il6(-/-) mice, suggesting an additional pathway by which T(H)17 cells might be generated in vivo. We show that an IL-2 cytokine family member, IL-21, cooperates with TGF-beta to induce T(H)17 cells in naive Il6(-/-) T cells and that IL-21-receptor-deficient T cells are defective in generating a T(H)17 response.","Harvard Univ, Brigham & Womens Hosp, Sch Med, Ctr Neurol Dis, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; Harvard Univ, Brigham & Womens Hosp, Sch Med, Ctr Neurol Dis, Boston, MA 02115 USA; Harvard Univ, Beth Israel Deaconess Med Ctr, Sch Med, Transplant Res Ctr, Boston, MA 02115 USA","Oukka, M (reprint author), Harvard Univ, Brigham & Womens Hosp, Sch Med, Ctr Neurol Dis, 65 Landsdowne St, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",moukka@rics.bwh.harvard.edu; vkuchroo@rics.bwh.harvard.edu,,"Korn, Thomas/0000-0002-3633-0955","NIAID NIH HHS [R01 AI073542, R01 AI073542-01]",,,30,1121,1211,0,44,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,26-Jul,2007,448,7152,,,,,484,U9,,10.1038/nature05970,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,193VG,WOS:000248302700049,17581588,No,Y,N,11/20/17

Mammalian GBF1 (ref. 2) and yeast Gea1/2 ( ref. 3) ARF-GEFs act at Golgi membranes, regulating COPI-coated vesicle formation. In contrast, their Arabidopsis thaliana homologue GNOM (GN) is required for endosomal recycling, playing an important part in development(4). This difference indicates an evolutionary divergence of trafficking pathways between animals and plants, and raised the question of how endoplasmic reticulum - Golgi transport is regulated in plants. Here we demonstrate that the closest homologue of GNOM in Arabidopsis, GNOM-LIKE1 (GNL1; NM_ 123312; At5g39500), performs this ancestral function. GNL1 localizes to and acts primarily at Golgi stacks, regulating COPI-coated vesicle formation. Surprisingly, GNOM can functionally substitute for GNL1, but not vice versa. Our results suggest that large ARF-GEFs of the GBF1 class perform a conserved role in endoplasmic reticulum - Golgi trafficking and secretion, which is done by GNL1 and GNOM in Arabidopsis, whereas GNOM has evolved to perform an additional plant-specific function of recycling from endosomes to the plasma membrane. Duplication and diversification of ARF-GEFs in plants contrasts with the evolution of entirely new classes of ARF-GEFs(5) for endosomal trafficking in animals, which illustrates the independent evolution of complex endosomal pathways in the two kingdoms.","Univ Tubingen, ZMBP, D-72076 Tubingen, Germany; Max Planck Inst Pflanzenzuchtung, D-50829 Cologne, Germany; Univ Heidelberg, Dept Cell Biol, Heidelberg Inst Plant Sci, D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany","Jurgens, G (reprint author), Univ Tubingen, ZMBP, Auf Morgenstelle 3, D-72076 Tubingen, Germany.",gerd.juergens@zmbp.uni-tuebingen.de,"Rios, Gabino/F-4046-2011",,,,,30,143,155,2,32,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,26-Jul,2007,448,7152,,,,,488,U10,,10.1038/nature05967,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,193VG,WOS:000248302700050,17653190,No,,,11/20/17

ARF-GEFs (guanine-nucleotide exchange factors for ADP-ribosylation factor GTPases) are essential for vesicular trafficking in all eukaryotic kingdoms, but of the eight ARF-GEF families, only the ancestral BIG and GBF types are found in plants(1,2). Whereas fungal and animal GBF proteins perform conserved functions at the Golgi, the Arabidopsis thaliana GBF protein GNOM is thought to act in only the process of recycling from endosomes(3-5). We now show that the related Arabidopsis GBF protein GNOM-LIKE1 (GNL1) has an ancestral function at the Golgi but is also required for selective internalization from the plasma membrane in the presence of brefeldin A (BFA). We identified gnl1 mutants that accumulated biosynthetic and recycling endoplasmic reticulum markers in enlarged internal compartments. Notably, in the absence of functional GNL1, Golgi stacks were rendered sensitive to the selective ARF-GEF inhibitor BFA, which caused them to fuse with the endoplasmic reticulum. Furthermore, in BFA-treated gnl1 roots, the internalization of a polar plasma-membrane marker, the auxin efflux carrier PIN2, was selectively inhibited. Thus, GNL1 is a BFA-resistant GBF protein that functions with a BFA-sensitive ARF-GEF both at the Golgi and in selective endocytosis, but not in recycling from endosomes. We propose that the evolution of endocytic trafficking in plants was accompanied by neo-functionalization within the GBF family, whereas in other kingdoms it occurred independently by elaboration of additional ARF-GEF families.","Univ Oxford, Dept Plant Sci, Oxford OX1 3RB, England","Moore, I (reprint author), Univ Oxford, Dept Plant Sci, S Parks Rd, Oxford OX1 3RB, England.",ian.moore@plants.ox.ac.uk,,,,,,35,149,154,2,11,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,26-Jul,2007,448,7152,,,,,493,496,,10.1038/nature06023,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,193VG,WOS:000248302700051,17653191,No,,,11/20/17

In Arabidopsis thaliana, the leucine-rich repeat receptor kinases flagellin-sensitive 2 (FLS2) (ref. 2) and elongation factor Tu receptor (EFR) ( ref. 3) act as pattern-recognition receptors for the bacterial PAMPs flagellin(4) and elongation factor Tu (EF-Tu) ( ref. 5) and contribute to resistance against bacterial pathogens. Little is known about the molecular mechanisms that link receptor activation to intracellular signal transduction. Here we show that BAK1 (BRI1-associated receptor kinase 1), a leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinase that has been reported to regulate the brassinosteroid receptor BRI1 (refs 6,7), is involved in signalling by FLS2 and EFR. Plants carrying bak1 mutations show normal flagellin binding but abnormal early and late flagellin-triggered responses, indicating that BAK1 acts as a positive regulator in signalling. The bak1-mutant plants also show a reduction in early, but not late, EF-Tu-triggered responses. The decrease in responses to PAMPs is not due to reduced sensitivity to brassino-steroids. We provide evidence that FLS2 and BAK1 form a complex in vivo, in a specific ligand-dependent manner, within the first minutes of stimulation with flagellin. Thus, BAK1 is not only associated with developmental regulation through the plant hormone receptor BRI1 ( refs 6,7), but also has a functional role in PRR-dependent signalling, which initiates innate immunity.","Univ Basel, Zurich Basel Plant Sci Ctr, Inst Bot, CH-4056 Basel, Switzerland; Sainsbury Lab, Norwich NR4 7UH, Norfolk, England; Max Planck Inst Plant Breeding Res, D-50829 Cologne, Germany; Univ Tubingen, Inst Plant Biochem, ZMBP, D-72076 Tubingen, Germany","Chinchilla, D (reprint author), Univ Basel, Zurich Basel Plant Sci Ctr, Inst Bot, Hebelstr 1, CH-4056 Basel, Switzerland.",delphine.chinchilla@unibas.ch; thomas.boller@unibas.ch,"Boller, Thomas/G-3500-2012; Robatzek, Silke/B-6844-2013; ZIPFEL, CYRIL/D-7103-2011; Jones, Jonathan/J-5129-2012","Boller, Thomas/0000-0001-6768-7503; ZIPFEL, CYRIL/0000-0003-4935-8583; Jones, Jonathan/0000-0002-4953-261X; Kemmerling, Birgit/0000-0003-1174-0189",,,,31,734,773,10,193,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,26-Jul,2007,448,7152,,,,,497,U12,,10.1038/nature05999,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,193VG,WOS:000248302700052,17625569,No,Y,N,11/20/17

In particular, DNA is a potent activator of immune responses during infection or tissue damage(5-7), and evidence indicates that, in addition to the membrane-associated Toll-like receptor 9, an unidentified cytosolic DNA sensor(s) can activate type I interferon (IFN) and other immune responses(8-10). Here we report on a candidate DNA sensor, previously named DLM-1 ( also called Z-DNA binding protein 1 (ZBP1))(11), for which biological function had remained unknown; we now propose the alternative name DAI (DNA-dependent activator of IFN-regulatory factors(12)). The artificial expression of otherwise IFN-inducible DAI (DLM-1/ ZBP1) in mouse fibroblasts selectively enhances the DNA-mediated induction of type I IFN and other genes involved in innate immunity. On the other hand, RNA interference of messenger RNA for DAI (DLM-1/ ZBP1) in cells inhibits this gene induction programme upon stimulation by DNA from various sources. Moreover, DAI (DLM-1/ZBP1) binds to double-stranded DNA and, by doing so, enhances its association with the IRF3 transcription factor and the TBK1 serine/threonine kinase. These observations underscore an integral role of DAI (DLM-1/ZBP1) in the DNA-mediated activation of innate immune responses, and may offer new insight into the signalling mechanisms underlying DNA- associated antimicrobial immunity and autoimmune disorders.","Univ Tokyo, Dept Immunol, Grad Sch Med, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo 1130033, Japan; Univ Tokyo, Dept 21st Century,Ctr Excellence Program, Grad Sch Med, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo 1130033, Japan; Univ Tokyo, Fac Med, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo 1130033, Japan; Hokkaido Univ, Div Signaling Canc & Immunol, Inst Med Genet, Sapporo, Hokkaido 0600815, Japan; Hokkaido Univ, Dept Lab Med, Grad Sch Med, Kita Ku, Sapporo, Hokkaido 0600815, Japan; Univ Tokyo, Dept Mol Biol & Med, Res Ctr Adv Sci & Technol, Meguro Ku, Tokyo 1538904, Japan","Taniguchi, T (reprint author), Univ Tokyo, Dept Immunol, Grad Sch Med, Bunkyo Ku, Hongo 7-3-1, Tokyo 1130033, Japan.",tada@m.u-tokyo.ac.jp,"Ohba, Yusuke/E-7944-2011; Honda, Kenya/N-5297-2015",,,,,30,881,938,9,85,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,26-Jul,2007,448,7152,,,,,501,U14,,10.1038/nature06013,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,193VG,WOS:000248302700053,17618271,No,Y,N,11/20/17

These induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells (hereafter called Fbx15 iPS cells) are similar to embryonic stem (ES) cells in morphology, proliferation and teratoma formation; however, they are different with regards to gene expression and DNA methylation patterns, and fail to produce adult chimaeras.

We obtained adult chimaeras from seven Nanog iPS cell clones, with one clone being transmitted through the germ line to the next generation.

Understanding the basis for protein-protein interactions requires the full characterization of the thermodynamics of their association. Historically it has been virtually impossible to experimentally estimate changes in protein conformational entropy, a potentially important component of the free energy of protein association. However, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy has emerged as a powerful tool for characterizing the dynamics of proteins. Here we employ changes in conformational dynamics as a proxy for corresponding changes in conformational entropy. We find that the change in internal dynamics of the protein calmodulin varies significantly on binding a variety of target domains. Surprisingly, the apparent change in the corresponding conformational entropy is linearly related to the change in the overall binding entropy. This indicates that changes in protein conformational entropy can contribute significantly to the free energy of protein-ligand association.","Univ Penn, Johnson Res Fdn, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; Univ Penn, Dept Biochem & Biophys, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA","Wand, AJ (reprint author), Univ Penn, Johnson Res Fdn, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",wand@mail.med.upenn.edu,,,NIDDK NIH HHS [R01 DK039806]; NIGMS NIH HHS [T32 GM008275],,,34,370,372,11,114,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,19-Jul,2007,448,7151,,,,,325,U3,,10.1038/nature05959,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,191GC,WOS:000248118300051,17637663,No,Y,N,11/20/17

Some of Io's plasma is captured by the planet's strong magnetic field to form a co-rotating torus at Io's distance; the remaining ions and electrons form Io's ionosphere. The torus and ionosphere are also depleted by three time-variable processes that produce a banana-shaped cloud orbiting with Io(1), a giant nebula extending out to about 500 Jupiter radii(2-5), and a jet close to Io(6-9). No spatial constraints exist for the sources of the first two; they have been inferred only from modelling the patterns seen in the trace gas sodium observed far from Io. Here we report observations that reveal a spatially confined stream that ejects sodium only from the wake of the Io-torus interaction, together with a visually distinct, spherically symmetrical outflow region arising from atmospheric sputtering. The spatial extent of the ionospheric wake that feeds the stream is more than twice that observed by the Galileo spacecraft and modelled successfully. This implies considerable variability, and therefore the need for additional modelling of volcanically-driven, episodic states of the great jovian nebula.","Boston Univ, Ctr Space Phys, Boston, MA 02215 USA; Boston Univ, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Boston, MA 02215 USA","Mendillo, M (reprint author), Boston Univ, Ctr Space Phys, Boston, MA 02215 USA.",mendillo@bu.edu,"Mendillo, Michael /H-4397-2014",,,,,27,11,11,1,3,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,19-Jul,2007,448,7151,,,,,330,332,,10.1038/nature06000,,3,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,191GC,WOS:000248118300052,17637664,No,,,11/20/17

For a single particle, the interference is between the amplitudes of the particle's wave-functions, whereas the interference between two particles is a direct result of quantum exchange statistics. Such interference is observed only in the joint probability of finding the particles in two separated detectors, after they were injected from two spatially separated and independent sources. Experimental realizations of two-particle interferometers have been proposed(2,3); in these proposals it was shown that such correlations are a direct signature of quantum entanglement(4) between the spatial degrees of freedom of the two particles ('orbital entanglement'), even though they do not interact with each other. In optics, experiments using indistinguishable pairs of photons encountered difficulties in generating pairs of independent photons and synchronizing their arrival times; thus they have concentrated on detecting bunching of photons (bosons) by coincidence measurements(5,6). Similar experiments with electrons are rather scarce. Cross-correlation measurements between partitioned currents, emanating from one source(7-10), yielded similar information to that obtained from auto-correlation (shot noise) measurements(11,12). The proposal of ref. 3 is an electronic analogue to the historical Hanbury Brown and Twiss experiment with classical light(13,14). It is based on the electronic Mach-Zehnder interferometer(15) that uses edge channels in the quantum Hall effect regime(16). Here we implement such an interferometer. We partitioned two independent and mutually incoherent electron beams into two trajectories, so that the combined four trajectories enclosed an Aharonov-Bohm flux. Although individual currents and their fluctuations (shot noise measured by auto-correlation) were found to be independent of the Aharonov-Bohm flux, the cross-correlation between current fluctuations at two opposite points across the device exhibited strong Aharonov-Bohm oscillations, suggesting orbital entanglement between the two electron beams.","Weizmann Inst Sci, Braun Ctr Submicron Res, Dept Condensed Matter Phys, IL-76100 Rehovot, Israel; Pusan Natl Univ, Dept Phys, Pusan 609735, South Korea","Heiblum, M (reprint author), Weizmann Inst Sci, Braun Ctr Submicron Res, Dept Condensed Matter Phys, IL-76100 Rehovot, Israel.",heiblum@wisemail.weizmann.ac.il,,,,,,23,192,193,8,43,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,19-Jul,2007,448,7151,,,,,333,337,,10.1038/nature05955,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,191GC,WOS:000248118300053,17637665,No,Y,N,11/20/17

Contact between the gecko foot and an opposing surface generates adhesive forces that are sufficient to allow the gecko to cling onto vertical and even inverted surfaces. Although strong, the adhesion is temporary, permitting rapid detachment and reattachment of the gecko foot during locomotion. Researchers have attempted to capture these properties of gecko adhesive in synthetic mimics with nanoscale surface features reminiscent of setae(2-7); however, maintenance of adhesive performance over many cycles has been elusive(2,8), and gecko adhesion is greatly diminished upon full immersion in water(9,10). Here we report a hybrid biologically inspired adhesive consisting of an array of nanofabricated polymer pillars coated with a thin layer of a synthetic polymer that mimics the wet adhesive proteins found in mussel holdfasts. Wet adhesion of the nanostructured polymer pillar arrays increased nearly 15-fold when coated with mussel-mimetic polymer.

It has been proposed that a significant flood event eroded a network of large ancient valleys on the floor of the English Channel - the narrow seaway between England and France(2-4). This hypothesis has remained untested through lack of direct evidence, and alternative non-catastrophist ideas have been entertained for valley formation(5,6). Here we analyse a new regional bathymetric map of part of the English Channel derived from high-resolution sonar data, which shows the morphology of the valley in unprecedented detail. We observe a large bedrock-floored valley that contains a distinct assemblage of landforms, including streamlined islands and longitudinal erosional grooves, which are indicative of large-scale subaerial erosion by high-magnitude water discharges. Our observations support the megaflood model, in which breaching of a rock dam at the Dover Strait instigated catastrophic drainage of a large pro-glacial lake in the southern North Sea basin(2). We suggest that megaflooding provides an explanation for the permanent isolation of Britain from mainland Europe during interglacial high-sea-level stands(7), and consequently for patterns of early human colonisation of Britain together with the large-scale reorganization of palaeodrainage in northwest Europe(4).","Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Dept Earth Sci & Engn, London SW7 2AZ, England; UK Hydrog Off, Taunton TA1 2DN, Somerset, England","Gupta, S (reprint author), Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Dept Earth Sci & Engn, London SW7 2AZ, England.",s.gupta@imperial.ac.uk,,,,,,31,119,120,2,58,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,19-Jul,2007,448,7151,,,,,342,U5,,10.1038/nature06018,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,191GC,WOS:000248118300055,17637667,No,,,11/20/17

Global genetic analyses have argued for one single origin, placed somewhere in Africa(4-7). This scenario implies a rapid expansion, with a series of bottlenecks of small amplitude, which would have led to the observed smooth loss of genetic diversity with increasing distance from Africa. Analyses of cranial data, on the other hand, have given mixed results(8-12), and have been argued to support multiple origins of modern humans(2,9,12). Using a large data set of skull measurements and an analytical framework equivalent to that used for genetic data, we show that the loss in genetic diversity has been mirrored by a loss in phenotypic variability. We find evidence for an African origin, placed somewhere in the central/southern part of the continent, which harbours the highest intra-population diversity in phenotypic measurements. We failed to find evidence for a second origin, and we confirm these results on a large genetic data set. Distance from Africa accounts for an average 19-25% of heritable variation in craniometric measurements - a remarkably strong effect for phenotypic measurements known to be under selection.","Univ Cambridge, Dept Zool, Cambridge CB2 3EJ, England; Univ Cambridge, Dept Genet, Cambridge CB2 3EH, England; Saga Med Sch, Dept Anat, Saga 8498501, Japan","Manica, A (reprint author), Univ Cambridge, Dept Zool, Downing St, Cambridge CB2 3EJ, England.",am315@cam.ac.uk,"Balloux, Francois/D-4783-2009; Manica, Andrea/B-5497-2008","Manica, Andrea/0000-0003-1895-450X; Balloux, Francois/0000-0003-1978-7715",Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council [BB/C007123/1],,,29,173,180,2,50,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,19-Jul,2007,448,7151,,,,,346,U6,,10.1038/nature05951,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,191GC,WOS:000248118300056,17637668,No,Y,N,11/20/17

The parental conflict theory suggests that genomic imprinting evolved after the emergence of an embryo-nourishing tissue (placenta and endosperm), resulting in an intragenomic parental conflict over the allocation of nutrients from mother to offspring(1,2). It was predicted that imprinted genes, which arose through antagonistic co-evolution driven by a parental conflict, should be subject to positive darwinian selection(3). Here we show that the imprinted plant gene MEDEA (MEA)(4,5), which is essential for seed development, originated during a whole-genome duplication 35 to 85 million years ago. After duplication, MEA underwent positive darwinian selection consistent with neo-functionalization and the parental conflict theory. MEA continues to evolve rapidly in the out-crossing species Arabidopsis lyrata but not in the self-fertilizing species Arabidopsis thaliana, where parental conflicts are reduced. The paralogue of MEA, SWINGER (SWN; also called EZA1)(6), is not imprinted and evolved under strong purifying selection because it probably retained the ancestral function of the common precursor gene. The evolution of MEA suggests a late origin of genomic imprinting within the Brassicaceae, whereas imprinting is thought to have originated early within the mammalian lineage(7).","Univ Zurich, Inst Plant Biol, CH-8008 Zurich, Switzerland; Univ Zurich, Zurich Basel Plant Sci Ctr, CH-8008 Zurich, Switzerland; Univ Coll Cork, Genet & Biotechnol Lab, Dept Biochem, Cork, Ireland; Univ Coll Cork, Biosci Inst, Cork, Ireland; Max Planck Inst Chem Ecol, Dept Genet & Evolut, D-07745 Jena, Germany; Univ Dublin Trinity Coll, Smurfit Inst Genet, Dublin, Ireland","Grossniklaus, U (reprint author), Univ Zurich, Inst Plant Biol, Zollikerstr 107, CH-8008 Zurich, Switzerland.",c.spillane@ucc.ie; grossnik@botinst.uzh.ch,"Wolfe, Kenneth/B-4653-2009; Grossniklaus, Ueli/A-2736-2012; Baroux, Celia/J-5359-2013; Grossniklaus, Ueli/E-9995-2016","Baroux, Celia/0000-0001-6307-2229; Grossniklaus, Ueli/0000-0002-0522-8974; Wolfe, Kenneth/0000-0003-4992-4979; Spillane, Charles/0000-0003-3318-323X",,,,40,91,94,2,7,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,19-Jul,2007,448,7151,,,,,349,U8,,10.1038/nature05984,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,191GC,WOS:000248118300057,17637669,No,,,11/20/17

It affects one in ten individuals over the age of 80 years, causes significant morbidity and is an independent predictor of mortality(2). Recent studies have provided evidence of a genetic contribution to AF(3-5). Mutations in potassium-channel genes have been associated with familial AF(6-10) but account for only a small fraction of all cases of AF(11,12). We have performed a genome-wide association scan, followed by replication studies in three populations of European descent and a Chinese population from Hong Kong and find a strong association between two sequence variants on chromosome 4q25 and AF. Here we show that about 35% of individuals of European descent have at least one of the variants and that the risk of AF increases by 1.72 and 1.39 per copy. The association with the stronger variant is replicated in the Chinese population, where it is carried by 75% of individuals and the risk of AF is increased by 1.42 per copy.

The importance of such coordination is highlighted by studies showing that circadian dysfunction causes reduced fitness in bacteria(1) and plants(2), as well as sleep and psychological disorders in humans(3). Plant cell growth requires energy and water-factors that oscillate owing to diurnal environmental changes. Indeed, two important factors controlling stem growth are the internal circadian oscillator(4-6) and external light levels(7). However, most circadian studies have been performed in constant conditions, precluding mechanistic study of interactions between the clock and diurnal variation in the environment. Studies of stem elongation in diurnal conditions have revealed complex growth patterns, but no mechanism has been described(8-10). Here we show that the growth phase of Arabidopsis seedlings in diurnal light conditions is shifted 8-12 h relative to plants in continuous light, and we describe a mechanism underlying this environmental response. We find that the clock regulates transcript levels of two basic helix-loop-helix genes, phytochrome-interacting factor 4 (PIF4) and PIF5, whereas light regulates their protein abundance. These genes function as positive growth regulators; the coincidence of high transcript levels (by the clock) and protein accumulation (in the dark) allows them to promote plant growth at the end of the night. Thus, these two genes integrate clock and light signalling, and their coordinated regulation explains the observed diurnal growth rhythms. This interaction may serve as a paradigm for understanding how endogenous and environmental signals cooperate to control other processes.","Univ Calif Davis, Plant Biol Sect, Coll Biol Sci, Davis, CA 95616 USA; Univ Lausanne, Ctr Integrative Genom, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland","Maloof, JN (reprint author), Univ Calif Davis, Plant Biol Sect, Coll Biol Sci, 1 Shields Ave, Davis, CA 95616 USA.",jnmaloof@ucdavis.edu,"Covington, Michael/G-9208-2014","Covington, Michael/0000-0002-0555-6409; Maloof, Julin/0000-0002-9623-2599; Harmer, Stacey/0000-0001-6813-6682; Fankhauser, Christian/0000-0003-4719-5901",,,,41,348,363,10,81,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,19-Jul,2007,448,7151,,,,,358,U11,,10.1038/nature05946,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,191GC,WOS:000248118300059,17589502,No,Y,N,11/20/17

Collective guidance of cell groups remains poorly understood, despite its relevance for development and metastasis(3). Neural crest cells and neuronal precursors migrate as loosely organized streams of individual cells(4,5), whereas cells of the fish lateral line(6,7), Drosophila tracheal tubes and border-cell clusters(8) migrate as more coherent groups. Here we use Drosophila border cells to examine how collective guidance is performed. We report that border cells migrate in two phases using distinct mechanisms. Genetic analysis combined with live imaging shows that polarized cell behaviour is critical for the initial phase of migration, whereas dynamic collective behaviour dominates later. PDGF- and VEGF-related receptor and epidermal growth factor receptor act in both phases, but use different effector pathways in each. The myoblast city (Mbc, also known as DOCK180) and engulfment and cell motility (ELMO, also known as Ced-12) pathway is required for the early phase, in which guidance depends on subcellular localization of signalling within a leading cell. During the later phase, mitogen-activated protein kinase and phospholipase C gamma are used redundantly, and we find that the cluster makes use of the difference in signal levels between cells to guide migration. Thus, information processing at the multicellular level is used to guide collective behaviour of a cell group.","European Mol Biol Lab, D-69117 Heidelberg, Germany; Natl Univ Singapore, Temasek Life Sci Lab TLL, Singapore 117604, Singapore","Rorth, P (reprint author), European Mol Biol Lab, D-69117 Heidelberg, Germany.",Pernille@tll.org.sg,"Rorth, Pernille/H-3020-2011; Ladoux, Benoit/A-9879-2013; Luque, Carlos/H-6810-2015","Luque, Carlos/0000-0002-2993-4152",,,,27,162,163,1,29,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,19-Jul,2007,448,7151,,,,,362,U12,,10.1038/nature05965,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,191GC,WOS:000248118300060,17637670,No,,,11/20/17

The small GTP-binding protein Rab(8) was thought to regulate basolateral transport in polarized kidney epithelial cells through the AP1B-complex-mediated pathway(8,9). However, the role of Rab8 (Rab8A) in cell polarity in vivo remains unknown. Here we show that Rab8 is responsible for the localization of apical proteins in intestinal epithelial cells. We found that apical peptidases and transporters localized to lysosomes in the small intestine of Rab8-deficient mice. Their mislocalization and degradation in lysosomes led to a marked reduction in the absorption rate of nutrients in the small intestine, and ultimately to death. Ultrastructurally, a shortening of apical microvilli, an increased number of enlarged lysosomes, and microvillus inclusions in the enterocytes were also observed. One microvillus inclusion disease patient who shows an identical phenotype to Rab8-deficient mice expresses a reduced amount of RAB8 (RAB8A; NM_005370). Our results demonstrate that Rab8 is necessary for the proper localization of apical proteins and the absorption and digestion of various nutrients in the small intestine.","Osaka Univ, Grad Sch Med, Dept Pediat, Suita, Osaka 5650871, Japan; Kanazawa Univ, Div Pharmaceut Sci, Grad Sch Nat Sci & Technol, Kanazawa, Ishikawa 9201192, Japan; Kumamoto Univ, Div Transgen Technol, CARD, IRDA, Kumamoto 8600811, Japan; Itami Municipal Hosp, Dept Pediat, Itami, Hyogo 6648540, Japan","Harada, A (reprint author), Gunma Univ, Lab Mol Traff, Dept Mol & Cellular Biol, Inst Mol & Cellular Regulat, Gunma 3718512, Japan.",aharada@showa.gunma-u.ac.jp,"KATO, Yukio/D-8396-2015","Kubo, Yoshiyuki/0000-0002-7905-5666",,,,28,182,187,1,18,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,19-Jul,2007,448,7151,,,,,366,369,,10.1038/nature05929,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,191GC,WOS:000248118300061,17597763,No,,,11/20/17

The mechanisms by which these effectors act are mostly unknown; however, they often promote disease by suppressing host immunity(2). One type III effector, AvrPtoB, expressed by the plant pathogen Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato, has a carboxy-terminal domain that is an E3 ubiquitin ligase(3). Deletion of this domain allows an amino-terminal region of AvrPtoB (AvrPtoB(1-387)) to be detected by certain tomato varieties leading to immunity-associated programmed cell death(4). Here we show that a host kinase, Fen, physically interacts with AvrPtoB(1-387) and is responsible for activating the plant immune response. The AvrPtoB E3 ligase specifically ubiquitinates Fen and promotes its degradation in a proteasome-dependent manner. This degradation leads to disease susceptibility in Fen-expressing tomato lines. Various wild species of tomato were found to exhibit immunity in response to AvrPtoB(1-387) and not to full-length AvrPtoB. Thus, by acquiring an E3 ligase domain, AvrPtoB has thwarted a highly conserved host resistance mechanism.","Cornell Univ, Boyce Thompson Inst Plant Res, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; Cornell Univ, Dept Plant Pathol, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA","Martin, GB (reprint author), Cornell Univ, Boyce Thompson Inst Plant Res, Tower Rd, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",gbm7@cornell.edu,"Martin, Gregory/F-6262-2011; Abramovitch, Robert/A-5324-2013","Martin, Gregory/0000-0003-0044-6830; Abramovitch, Robert/0000-0002-4119-4169","NIGMS NIH HHS [R01 GM078021, R01 GM078021-02]",,,32,182,189,3,43,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,19-Jul,2007,448,7151,,,,,370,U13,,10.1038/nature05966,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,191GC,WOS:000248118300062,17637671,No,Y,N,11/20/17

Here we report the generation and validation of a genome-wide library of Drosophila melanogaster RNAi transgenes, enabling the conditional inactivation of gene function in specific tissues of the intact organism. Our RNAi transgenes consist of short gene fragments cloned as inverted repeats and expressed using the binary GAL4/UAS system. We generated 22,270 transgenic lines, covering 88% of the predicted protein-coding genes in the Drosophila genome.

In the EC/AMPcPP structure, the substrate binds to the active ('insertion') site closed through refolding of the trigger loop (TL) into two alpha-helices. In contrast, the EC/AMPcPP/streptolydigin structure reveals an inactive ('preinsertion') substrate configuration stabilized by streptolydigin-induced displacement of the TL. Our structural and biochemical data suggest that refolding of the TL is vital for catalysis and have three main implications.

Here we report an analysis of recent observations of the hot Jupiter HD 189733b (ref. 6) taken during the transit, when the planet passed in front of its parent star. We find that absorption by water vapour is the most likely cause of the wavelength-dependent variations in the effective radius of the planet at the infrared wavelengths 3.6 mu m, 5.8 mu m (both ref. 7) and 8 mu m (ref. 8). The larger effective radius observed at visible wavelengths(9) may arise from either stellar variability or the presence of clouds/hazes.

To determine the relevance of these factors, measurements of the chemistry as a function of depth in cometary nuclei are critical. Fragmenting comets expose formerly buried material, but observational constraints have in the past limited the ability to assess the importance of formative conditions and the effects of evolutionary processes on measured composition(5-8). Here we report the chemical composition of two distinct fragments of 73P/Schwassmann-Wachmann 3. The fragments are remarkably similar in composition, in marked contrast to the chemical diversity within the overall comet population and contrary to the expectation that short-period comets should show strong compositional variation with depth in the nucleus owing to evolutionary processing from numerous close passages to the Sun. Comet 73P/Schwassmann-Wachmann 3 is also depleted in the most volatile ices compared to other comets, suggesting that the depleted carbon-chain chemistry seen in some comets from the Kuiper belt reservoir is primordial and not evolutionary(1).","Johns Hopkins Univ, Appl Phys Lab, Dept Space, Laurel, MD 20723 USA; Observ Meudon Paris, LESIA, F-92190 Meudon, France","Dello Russo, N (reprint author), Johns Hopkins Univ, Appl Phys Lab, Dept Space, 11100 Johns Hopkins Rd, Laurel, MD 20723 USA.",neil.dello.russo@jhuapl.edu,"Dello Russo, Neil/G-2727-2015; Vervack, Ronald/C-2702-2016; Weaver, Harold/D-9188-2016; Lisse, Carey/B-7772-2016","Dello Russo, Neil/0000-0002-8379-7304; Vervack, Ronald/0000-0002-8227-9564; Lisse, Carey/0000-0002-9548-1526",,,,30,61,62,0,2,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,12-Jul,2007,448,7150,,,,,172,175,,10.1038/nature05908,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,188QN,WOS:000247934500037,17625560,No,,,11/20/17

These techniques, such as photoemission and tunnelling, yield measurements of the 'single-particle' density of states spectrum of a system(2). This density of states is proportional to the probability of successfully injecting or ejecting an electron in these experiments. It is equal to the number of electronic states in the system able to accept an injected electron as a function of its energy, and is among the most fundamental and directly calculable quantities in theories of highly interacting systems(3). However, the two-dimensional electron system (2DES), host to remarkable correlated electron states such as the fractional quantum Hall effect(4), has proved difficult to probe spectroscopically. Here we present an improved version of time-domain capacitance spectroscopy(5) that allows us to measure the single-particle density of states of a 2DES with unprecedented fidelity and resolution. Using the method, we perform measurements of a cold 2DES, providing direct measurements of interesting correlated electronic effects at energies that are difficult to reach with other techniques; these effects include the single-particle exchange-enhanced spin gap(6), single-particle lifetimes(7) in the quantum Hall system, and exchange splitting of Landau levels not at the Fermi surface.","MIT, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; Bell Labs, Alcatel Lucent, Murray Hill, NJ 07974 USA","Ashoori, RC (reprint author), MIT, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",dial@alum.mit.edu; ashoori@mit.edu,,,,,,26,46,46,4,32,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,12-Jul,2007,448,7150,,,,,176,179,,10.1038/nature05982,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,188QN,WOS:000247934500038,17625561,No,,,11/20/17

The observed increase in nitrogen loading is caused by population growth, urbanization, expanding water and sewer infrastructure, fossil fuel combustion and synthetic fertilizer consumption(1,2). Most of the nitrogen is removed by denitrification in the sediments of estuaries and the continental shelf, leading to a reduction in both cultural eutrophication and nitrogen pollution of the open ocean(3,4). Nitrogen fixation, however, is thought to be a negligible process in sub-tidal heterotrophic marine systems(5). Here we report sediment core data from Narragansett Bay, USA, which demonstrate that heterotrophic marine sediments can switch from being a net sink to being a net source of nitrogen. Mesocosm and core incubation experiments, together with a historic data set of mean annual chlorophyll production(6,7), support the idea that a climate-induced decrease in primary production has led to a decrease in organic matter deposition to the benthos and the observed reversal of the net sediment nitrogen flux. Our results suggest that some estuaries may no longer remove nitrogen from the water column. Instead, nitrogen could be exported to the continental shelf and the open ocean and could shift the effect of anthropogenic nitrogen loading beyond the immediate coastal zone.","Univ Rhode Isl, Grad Sch Oceanog, Narragansett, RI 02882 USA","Fulweiler, RW (reprint author), Univ Rhode Isl, Grad Sch Oceanog, Narragansett, RI 02882 USA.",wally@gso.uri.edu,"Fulweiler, Robinson/A-3806-2010","Fulweiler, Robinson/0000-0003-0871-4246",,,,31,98,100,6,73,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,12-Jul,2007,448,7150,,,,,180,182,,10.1038/nature05963,,3,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,188QN,WOS:000247934500039,17625562,No,,,11/20/17

Slow-spreading mid-ocean-ridge segments exhibit significant crustal thinning towards transform and non-transform offsets(1-12), which is thought to arise from a three-dimensional process of buoyant mantle upwelling and melt migration focused beneath the centres of ridge segments(1,2,4-7,9,10,12). In contrast, fast-spreading mid-ocean ridges are characterized by smaller, segment-scale variations in crustal thickness, which reflect more uniform mantle upwelling beneath the ridge axis(13-15). Here we present a systematic study of the residual mantle Bouguer gravity anomaly of 19 oceanic transform faults that reveals a strong correlation between gravity signature and spreading rate. Previous studies have shown that slow-slipping transform faults are marked by more positive gravity anomalies than their adjacent ridge segments(1,2,4,6), but our analysis reveals that intermediate and fast-slipping transform faults exhibit more negative gravity anomalies than their adjacent ridge segments. This finding indicates that there is a mass deficit at intermediate- and fast-slipping transform faults, which could reflect increased rock porosity, serpentinization of mantle peridotite, and/or crustal thickening. The most negative anomalies correspond to topographic highs flanking the transform faults, rather than to transform troughs (where deformation is probably focused and porosity and alteration are expected to be greatest), indicating that crustal thickening could be an important contributor to the negative gravity anomalies observed. This finding in turn suggests that three-dimensional magma accretion may occur near intermediate- and fast-slipping transform faults.","MIT, Woods Hole Oceanog Inst Joint Program, Dept Geol & Geophys, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; Woods Hole Oceanog Inst, Dept Geol & Geophys, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA","Gregg, PM (reprint author), MIT, Woods Hole Oceanog Inst Joint Program, Dept Geol & Geophys, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",pgregg@whoi.edu,"Montesi, Laurent/C-5216-2009; Behn, Mark/F-5813-2012","Montesi, Laurent/0000-0002-3519-1412; Behn, Mark/0000-0002-2001-1335",,,,38,36,36,0,15,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,12-Jul,2007,448,7150,,,,,183,U5,,10.1038/nature05962,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,188QN,WOS:000247934500040,17625563,No,,,11/20/17

Individual ecosystem functions generally show a positive asymptotic relationship with increasing biodiversity, suggesting that some species are redundant(5-8). However, ecosystems are managed and conserved for multiple functions, which may require greater biodiversity. Here we present an analysis of published data from grassland biodiversity experiments(9-11), and show that ecosystem multifunctionality does require greater numbers of species. We analysed each ecosystem function alone to identify species with desirable effects. We then calculated the number of species with positive effects for all possible combinations of functions. Our results show appreciable differences in the sets of species influencing different ecosystem functions, with average proportional overlap of about 0.2 to 0.5. Consequently, as more ecosystem processes were included in our analysis, more species were found to affect overall functioning. Specifically, for all of the analysed experiments, there was a positive saturating relationship between the number of ecosystem processes considered and the number of species influencing overall functioning. We conclude that because different species often influence different functions, studies focusing on individual processes in isolation will underestimate levels of biodiversity required to maintain multifunctional ecosystems.","Univ Zurich, Inst Environm Sci, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland","Hector, A (reprint author), Univ Zurich, Inst Environm Sci, Winterthurerstr 190, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland.",ahector@uwinst.uzh.ch,"Bagchi, Robert/F-1732-2011; Hector, Andrew/H-4199-2011","Bagchi, Robert/0000-0003-4035-4105; Hector, Andrew/0000-0002-1309-7716",,,,32,382,423,34,461,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,12-Jul,2007,448,7150,,,,,188,U6,,10.1038/nature05947,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,188QN,WOS:000247934500041,17625564,No,Y,N,11/20/17

The most notable exceptions were the derivation of non-human primate ES cell lines(3) followed shortly thereafter by their derivation of human ES cells(4). Despite the apparent common origin and the similar pluripotency of mouse and human embryonic stem cells, recent studies have revealed that they use different signalling pathways to maintain their pluripotent status. Mouse ES cells depend on leukaemia inhibitory factor and bone morphogenetic protein, whereas their human counterparts rely on activin (INHBA)/nodal (NODAL) and fibroblast growth factor (FGF). Here we show that pluripotent stem cells can be derived from the late epiblast layer of post-implantation mouse and rat embryos using chemically defined, activin-containing culture medium that is sufficient for long-term maintenance of human embryonic stem cells. Our results demonstrate that activin/Nodal signalling has an evolutionarily conserved role in the derivation and the maintenance of pluripotency in these novel stem cells.

Previous work suggested that mouse ES cells could only be obtained from the embryo before implantation in the uterus(1-5). Here we show that cell lines can be derived from the epiblast, a tissue of the post-implantation embryo that generates the embryo proper. These cells, which we refer to as EpiSCs (post-implantation epiblast-derived stem cells), express transcription factors known to regulate pluripotency, maintain their genomic integrity, and robustly differentiate into the major somatic cell types as well as primordial germ cells. The EpiSC lines are distinct from mouse ES cells in their epigenetic state and the signals controlling their differentiation. Furthermore, EpiSC and human ES cells share patterns of gene expression and signalling responses that normally function in the epiblast.

Site-directed mutagenesis revealed essential conservation of structure-function relations with P2X receptors of higher organisms. The receptor was insensitive to the usual P2X antagonists(3) but was blocked by nanomolar concentrations of Cu2+ ions. In D. discoideum, the receptor was found on intracellular membranes, with prominent localization to an osmoregulatory organelle, the contractile vacuole. Targeted disruption of the gene in D. discoideum resulted in cells that were unable to regulate cell volume in hypotonic conditions. Cell swelling in these mutant cells was accompanied by a marked inhibition of contractile vacuole emptying.

One such channel TRP melastatin 8 (TRPM8) or cold and menthol receptor 1 (CMR1)-is activated by chemical cooling agents (such as menthol) or when ambient temperatures drop below similar to 26 degrees C, suggesting that it mediates the detection of cold thermal stimuli by primary afferent sensory neurons(5,6). However, some studies have questioned the contribution of TRPM8 to cold detection or proposed that other excitatory or inhibitory channels are more critical to this sensory modality in vivo(7-10). Here we show that cultured sensory neurons and intact sensory nerve fibres from TRPM8-deficient mice exhibit profoundly diminished responses to cold. These animals also show clear behavioural deficits in their ability to discriminate between cold and warm surfaces, or to respond to evaporative cooling. At the same time, TRPM8 mutant mice are not completely insensitive to cold as they avoid contact with surfaces below 10 degrees C, albeit with reduced efficiency. Thus, our findings demonstrate an essential and predominant role for TRPM8 in thermosensation over a wide range of cold temperatures, validating the hypothesis(2) that TRP channels are the principal sensors of thermal stimuli in the peripheral nervous system.","Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Physiol, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Mol & Cellular Pharmacol, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Anat & Physiol, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; Univ Calif San Francisco, WM Keck Ctr Integrat Neurosci, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; Med Coll Wisconsin, Dept Cell Biol Neurobiol & Anat, Milwaukee, WI 53226 USA; Yale Univ, Sch Med, Dept Pharmacol, New Haven, CT 06520 USA","Julius, D (reprint author), Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Physiol, Box 0444, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA.",cstucky@mcw.edu; sven.jordt@yale.edu; julius@cmp.ucsf.edu,,,NIEHS NIH HHS [R01 ES015056],,,32,507,520,3,56,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,12-Jul,2007,448,7150,,,,,204,208,,10.1038/nature05910,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,188QN,WOS:000247934500045,17538622,No,Y,N,11/20/17

Rice accumulates up to 10% silicon in the shoot, and this high accumulation is required to protect the plant from multiple abiotic and biotic stresses(1-5). A gene, Lsi1, that encodes a silicon influx transporter has been identified in rice(6). Here we describe a previously uncharacterized gene, low silicon rice 2 (Lsi2), which has no similarity to Lsi1. This gene is constitutively expressed in the roots. The protein encoded by this gene is localized, like Lsi1, on the plasma membrane of cells in both the exodermis and the endodermis, but in contrast to Lsi1, which is localized on the distal side, Lsi2 is localized on the proximal side of the same cells. Expression of Lsi2 in Xenopus oocytes did not result in influx transport activity for silicon, but preloading of the oocytes with silicon resulted in a release of silicon, indicating that Lsi2 is a silicon efflux transporter. The identification of this silicon transporter revealed a unique mechanism of nutrient transport in plants: having an influx transporter on one side and an efflux transporter on the other side of the cell to permit the effective transcellular transport of the nutrients.","Okayama Univ, Bioresources Res Inst, Kurashiki, Okayama 7100046, Japan; Inst Soc Technoinnovat Agr Forestry & Fisheries, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3050854, Japan; Univ Tokyo, Biotechnol Res Ctr, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo 1138657, Japan; Japan Sci & Technol Agcy, Solut Oriented Res Sci & Technol, Tokyo 1030027, Japan; Natl Inst Agrobiol Sci, QTL Genom Res Ctr, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058602, Japan","Ma, JF (reprint author), Okayama Univ, Bioresources Res Inst, Chuo 2-20-1, Kurashiki, Okayama 7100046, Japan.",maj@rib.okayama-u.ac.jp,"Ma, Jian Feng/C-7213-2009; FUJIWARA, Toru/A-4119-2011; YAMAJI, Naoki/B-2524-2011","Ma, Jian Feng/0000-0003-3411-827X; YAMAJI, Naoki/0000-0002-7499-3004",,,,28,288,314,8,128,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,12-Jul,2007,448,7150,,,,,209,U12,,10.1038/nature05964,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,188QN,WOS:000247934500046,17625566,No,Y,N,11/20/17

Camptothecins, such as topotecan, induce cell death by poisoning DNA topoisomerase I, an enzyme capable of removing DNA supercoils(1-4). Topotecan is thought to stabilize a covalent topoisomerase-DNA complex(5-7), rendering it an obstacle to DNA replication forks(2,3,8,9). Here we use single-molecule nanomanipulation to monitor the dynamics of human topoisomerase I in the presence of topotecan. This allowed us to detect the binding and unbinding of an individual topotecan molecule in real time and to quantify the drug-induced trapping of topoisomerase on DNA. Unexpectedly, our findings also show that topotecan significantly hinders topoisomerase-mediated DNA uncoiling, with a more pronounced effect on the removal of positive (overwound) versus negative supercoils. In vivo experiments in the budding yeast verified the resulting prediction that positive supercoils would accumulate during transcription and replication as a consequence of camptothecin poisoning of topoisomerase I. Positive supercoils, however, were not induced by drug treatment of cells expressing a catalytically active, camptothecin-resistant topoisomerase I mutant. This combination of single-molecule and in vivo data suggests a cytotoxic mechanism for camptothecins, in which the accumulation of positive supercoils ahead of the replication machinery induces potentially lethal DNA lesions.","Delft Univ Technol, Fac Sci Appl, Kavli Inst Nanosci, NL-2628 CJ Delft, Netherlands; St Jude Childrens Hosp, Dept Mol Pharmacol, Memphis, TN 38105 USA","Dekker, NH (reprint author), Delft Univ Technol, Fac Sci Appl, Kavli Inst Nanosci, Lorentzweg 1, NL-2628 CJ Delft, Netherlands.",n.h.dekker@tudelft.nl,,"Dekker, Nynke/0000-0003-4029-0973",,,,30,171,171,1,19,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,12-Jul,2007,448,7150,,,,,213,217,,10.1038/nature05938,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,188QN,WOS:000247934500047,17589503,No,,,11/20/17

Here we show that a short peptide derived from rabies virus glycoprotein (RVG) enables the transvascular delivery of small interfering RNA ( siRNA) to the brain. This 29-amino-acid peptide specifically binds to the acetylcholine receptor expressed by neuronal cells. To enable siRNA binding, a chimaeric peptide was synthesized by adding nonamer arginine residues at the carboxy terminus of RVG. This RVG-9R peptide was able to bind and transduce siRNA to neuronal cells in vitro, resulting in efficient gene silencing. After intravenous injection into mice, RVG-9R delivered siRNA to the neuronal cells, resulting in specific gene silencing within the brain. Furthermore, intravenous treatment with RVG-9R-bound antiviral siRNA afforded robust protection against fatal viral encephalitis in mice. Repeated administration of RVG-9R-bound siRNA did not induce inflammatory cytokines or anti-peptide antibodies. Thus, RVG-9R provides a safe and noninvasive approach for the delivery of siRNA and potentially other therapeutic molecules across the blood - brain barrier.","Harvard Univ, Sch Med, CBR Inst Biomed Res, Boston, MA 02115 USA; Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Pediat, Boston, MA 02115 USA; Univ Iowa, Dept Internal Med, Roy J & Lucille J Carver Coll Med, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA; Samchully Pharm Co Ltd, Res Ctr, Seoul 135735, South Korea; Hanyang Univ, Dept Bioengn, Seoul 133791, South Korea; Hanyang Univ, Hanyang Fus Mat Program, Seoul 133791, South Korea","Manjunath, N (reprint author), Harvard Univ, Sch Med, CBR Inst Biomed Res, Boston, MA 02115 USA.",shankar@cbrinstitute.org; swamy@cbrinstitute.org,"Kumar, Priti/C-5699-2009",,,,,36,651,701,6,145,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,5-Jul,2007,448,7149,,,,,39,43,,10.1038/nature05901,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,185OS,WOS:000247720900032,17572664,No,Y,N,11/20/17

The most studied group of T cells that interact with lipid antigens are natural killer T (NKT) cells, which characteristically express a semi-invariant T-cell receptor ( NKT TCR) that specifically recognizes the CD1 family member, CD1d. NKT-cell-mediated recognition of the CD1d - antigen complex has been implicated in microbial immunity, tumour immunity, autoimmunity and allergy. Here we describe the structure of a human NKT TCR in complex with CD1d bound to the potent NKT-cell agonist alpha-galactosylceramide, the archetypal CD1d-restricted glycolipid. In contrast to T-cell receptor - peptide- antigen - MHC complexes, the NKT TCR docked parallel to, and at the extreme end of the CD1d-binding cleft, which enables a lock-and-key type interaction with the lipid antigen. The structure provides a basis for the interaction between the highly conserved NKT TCR alpha-chain and the CD1d - antigen complex that is typified in innate immunity, and also indicates how variability of the NKT TCR beta-chain can impact on recognition of other CD1d - antigen complexes. These findings provide direct insight into how a T-cell receptor recognizes a lipid-antigen-presenting molecule of the immune system.","Monash Univ, Prot Crystallog Unit, ARC Ctr Excellence Struct & Funct Microbial Genom, Dept Biochem & Mol Biol,Sch Biomed Sci, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia; Univ Melbourne, Dept Microbiol & Immunol, Parkville, Vic 3010, Australia; Univ Birmingham, Sch Biosci, Birmingham B15 2TT, W Midlands, England","Rossjohn, J (reprint author), Monash Univ, Prot Crystallog Unit, ARC Ctr Excellence Struct & Funct Microbial Genom, Dept Biochem & Mol Biol,Sch Biomed Sci, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia.",jamesm1@unimelb.edu.au; jamie.rossjohn@med.monash.edu.au,"Rossjohn, Jamie/F-9032-2013; Bharadwaj, Mandvi/C-4446-2014; McCluskey, James/A-1291-2007","Rossjohn, Jamie/0000-0002-2020-7522; McCluskey, James/0000-0002-8597-815X; Besra, Gurdyal/0000-0002-5605-0395; Borg, Natalie/0000-0002-8677-9056",Medical Research Council [G0400421]; Wellcome Trust,,,36,370,383,8,35,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,5-Jul,2007,448,7149,,,,,44,49,,10.1038/nature05907,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,185OS,WOS:000247720900033,17581592,No,Y,N,11/20/17

These excitations have caused considerable interest because their low energy allows them to participate in many dynamical processes involving electrons and phonons(3), and because they might mediate the formation of Cooper pairs in high-transition-temperature superconductors(6). Metals often support electronic states that are confined to the surface, forming a nearly 2D electron-density layer. However, it was argued that these systems could not support low-energy collective excitations because they would be screened out by the underlying bulk electrons(7). Rather, metallic surfaces should support only conventional surface plasmons(8) - higher-energy modes that depend only on the electron density. Surface plasmons have important applications in microscopy(9,10) and sub-wavelength optics(11-13), but have no relevance to the low-energy dynamics. Here we show that, in contrast to expectations, a low-energy collective excitation mode can be found on bare metal surfaces. The mode has an acoustic ( linear) dispersion, different to the q(parallel to)(1/2) dependence of a 2D plasmon, and was observed on Be( 0001) using angle-resolved electron energy loss spectroscopy. First-principles calculations show that it is caused by the coexistence of a partially occupied quasi-2D surface-state band with the underlying 3D bulk electron continuum and also that the non-local character of the dielectric function prevents it from being screened out by the 3D states. The acoustic plasmon reported here has a very general character and should be present on many metal surfaces. Furthermore, its acoustic dispersion allows the confinement of light on small surface areas and in a broad frequency range, which is relevant for nano-optics and photonics applications.","Univ New Hampshire, Dept Phys, Durham, NH 03824 USA; Univ New Hampshire, Mat Sci Program, Durham, NH 03824 USA; Univ Genoa, CNISM, I-16146 Genoa, Italy; Univ Genoa, Dipartimento Fis, I-16146 Genoa, Italy; Univ Aarhus, Inst Storage Ring Facil, DK-8000 Aarhus C, Denmark; Univ Aarhus, Interdisciplinary Nanosci Ctr iNANO, DK-8000 Aarhus C, Denmark; Univ Basque Country, Fac Ciencias Quim, DIPC, Dept Fis Mat, San Sebastian 20018, Spain; Univ Basque Country, Fac Ciencias Quim, Ctr Mixto, CSIC, San Sebastian 20018, Spain; Univ Basque Country, CIC Nanogune Consolider & Mat Kondentsatuaren Fis, E-2009 Donostia San Sebastian, Basque, Spain; Univ Autonoma Madrid, Dept Fis Mat Condensada, E-28049 Madrid, Spain; Univ Genoa, IMEM CNR, I-16146 Genoa, Italy; Univ Genoa, Dipartimento Fis, I-16146 Genoa, Italy","Pohl, K (reprint author), Univ New Hampshire, Dept Phys, Durham, NH 03824 USA.",karsten.pohl@unh.edu,"Savio, Letizia/B-8323-2015; Pitarke, Jose/C-8602-2009; Bogdan, Diaconescu/C-8545-2009; Silkin, Vyacheslav/G-5446-2011; nanoGUNE, CIC/A-2623-2015; Chulkov, Eugeni/J-5015-2017; Rocca, Mario/J-1802-2016; CSIC-UPV/EHU, CFM/F-4867-2012; Farias, Daniel/L-2435-2013; Hofmann, Philip/B-5938-2008; DONOSTIA INTERNATIONAL PHYSICS CTR., DIPC/C-3171-2014","Savio, Letizia/0000-0001-7410-0715; Pitarke, Jose/0000-0002-8253-8028; Silkin, Vyacheslav/0000-0002-7840-3868; Vattuone, Luca/0000-0003-3718-6470; Farias, Daniel/0000-0002-8537-8074; Hofmann, Philip/0000-0002-7367-5821; ",,,,24,127,127,4,76,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,5-Jul,2007,448,7149,,,,,57,59,,10.1038/nature05975,,3,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,185OS,WOS:000247720900036,17611537,No,,,11/20/17

Moreover, the recent identification of large deposits of phyllosilicates, associated with the ancient Noachian terrains(2,3) suggests long-timescale weathering(4) of the primary basaltic crust by liquid water(2,5). It has been proposed that a greenhouse effect resulting from a carbon-dioxide-rich atmosphere sustained the temperate climate required to maintain liquid water on the martian surface during the Noachian(6,7). The apparent absence of carbonates and the low escape rates of carbon dioxide(8), however, are indicative of an early martian atmosphere with low levels of carbon dioxide. Here we investigate the geochemical conditions prevailing on the surface of Mars during the Noachian period using calculations of the aqueous equilibria of phyllosilicates. Our results show that Fe3+-rich phyllosilicates probably precipitated under weakly acidic to alkaline pH, an environment different from that of the following period, which was dominated by strongly acid weathering(9) that led to the sulphate deposits identified on Mars(10-12). Thermodynamic calculations demonstrate that the oxidation state of the martian surface was already high, supporting early escape of hydrogen. Finally, equilibrium with carbonates implies that phyllosilicate precipitation occurs preferentially at a very low partial pressure of carbon dioxide. We suggest that the possible absence of Noachian carbonates more probably resulted from low levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide, rather than primary acidic conditions(13). Other greenhouse gases may therefore have played a part in sustaining a warm and wet climate on the early Mars.","Univ Arkansas, WM Keck Lab Space Simulat, Arkansas Ctr Space & Planetary Sci, Fayetteville, AR 72701 USA; Univ Paris 11, Inst Astrophys Spatiale, F-91405 Orsay, France; CNRS, UMR 8617, F-91405 Orsay, France","Chevrier, V (reprint author), Univ Arkansas, WM Keck Lab Space Simulat, Arkansas Ctr Space & Planetary Sci, MUSE 202, Fayetteville, AR 72701 USA.",vchevrie@uark.edu,,,,,,29,113,113,2,27,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,5-Jul,2007,448,7149,,,,,60,63,,10.1038/nature05961,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,185OS,WOS:000247720900037,17611538,No,,,11/20/17

Although mimicry is a mainstay of adaptationist thinking, there has been repeated debate on whether there is a mutualistic or a parasitic relationship between unequally defended co-mimic species(2-5). Here we show that the relationship between unequally defended species is mutualistic. We examined this in a 'novel world'(6) of artificial prey with wild predators ( great tit, Parus major). We kept the abundance of a highly defended prey ('model') constant and increased the density of a moderately defended prey ('defended mimic') of either perfect or imperfect mimetic resemblance to the model. Both model and defended mimic showed a net benefit from a density-dependent decrease in their per capita mortality. Even when the effect of dilution through density was controlled for, defended mimics did not induce additional attacks on the model, but we found selection for accurate signal mimicry. In comparison, the addition of fully edible (batesian) mimics did increase additional attacks on the model, but as a result of dilution this resulted in no overall increase in per capita mortality. By ignoring the effects of density, current theories may have overestimated the parasitic costs imposed by less defended mimics on highly defended models.","Univ Liverpool, Sch Biol Sci, Liverpool L69 7ZB, Merseyside, England; Univ Jyvaskyla, Dept Biol & Environm Sci, FI-40014 Jyvaskyla, Finland","Rowland, HM (reprint author), Univ Liverpool, Sch Biol Sci, Biosci Bldg,Crown St, Liverpool L69 7ZB, Merseyside, England.",h.m.rowland@liv.ac.uk,"Lindstrom, Leena/B-2326-2012; Marion-Poll, Frederic/D-8882-2011","Lindstrom, Leena/0000-0002-6452-4538; Marion-Poll, Frederic/0000-0001-6824-0180; Mappes, Johanna/0000-0002-1117-5629",,,,30,77,77,0,41,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,5-Jul,2007,448,7149,,,,,64,67,,10.1038/nature05899,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,185OS,WOS:000247720900038,17611539,No,,,11/20/17

Proteins that bind specific phosphoinositides mediate interactions between membrane-bounded compartments whose identity is partially encoded by cytoplasmic phospholipid tags. Little is known about the localization and regulation of mammalian phosphatidylinositol-3,5-bisphosphate ( PtdIns( 3,5)P(2)), a phospholipid present in small quantities that regulates membrane trafficking in the endosome - lysosome axis in yeast(2). Here we describe a multi-organ disorder with neuronal degeneration in the central nervous system, peripheral neuronopathy and diluted pigmentation in the 'pale tremor' mouse. Positional cloning identified insertion of ETn2 beta ( early transposon 2 beta)(3) into intron 18 of Fig4 (A530089I17Rik), the homologue of a yeast SAC ( suppressor of actin) domain PtdIns(3,5) P(2) 5-phosphatase located in the vacuolar membrane. The abnormal concentration of PtdIns( 3,5) P2 in cultured fibroblasts from pale tremor mice demonstrates the conserved biochemical function of mammalian Fig4. The cytoplasm of fibroblasts from pale tremor mice is filled with large vacuoles that are immunoreactive for LAMP-2 (lysosomal-associated membrane protein 2), consistent with dysfunction of the late endosome - lysosome axis. Neonatal neurodegeneration in sensory and autonomic ganglia is followed by loss of neurons from layers four and five of the cortex, deep cerebellar nuclei and other localized brain regions. The sciatic nerve exhibits reduced numbers of large-diameter myelinated axons, slowed nerve conduction velocity and reduced amplitude of compound muscle action potentials.

Neurotrophic factors promote survival, differentiation and maintenance of neurons in developing and adult vertebrate nervous system(2,3). The most potent neurotrophic factor for dopamine neurons described so far is the glial-cell-line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF)(4). Here we have identified a conserved dopamine neurotrophic factor (CDNF) as a trophic factor for dopamine neurons. CDNF, together with its previously described vertebrate and invertebrate homologue the mesencephalic-astrocyte-derived neurotrophic factor(5), is a secreted protein with eight conserved cysteine residues, predicting a unique protein fold and defining a new, evolutionarily conserved protein family. CDNF (Armetl1) is expressed in several tissues of mouse and human, including the mouse embryonic and postnatal brain. In vivo, CDNF prevented the 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-induced degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in a rat experimental model of Parkinson's disease. A single injection of CDNF before 6-OHDA delivery into the striatum significantly reduced amphetamine-induced ipsilateral turning behaviour and almost completely rescued dopaminergic tyrosine-hydroxylase-positive cells in the substantia nigra. When administered four weeks after 6-OHDA, intrastriatal injection of CDNF was able to restore the dopaminergic function and prevent the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in substantia nigra. Thus, CDNF was at least as efficient as GDNF in both experimental settings. Our results suggest that CDNF might be beneficial for the treatment of Parkinson's disease.","Univ Helsinki, Inst Biotechnol, Viikki Bioctr, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland; Univ Helsinki, Div Pharmacol & Toxicol, Viikki Bioctr, Fac Pharm, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland; Tallinn Univ Technol, Dept Gene Technol, EE-19086 Tallinn, Estonia","Saarma, M (reprint author), Univ Helsinki, Inst Biotechnol, Viikki Bioctr, POB 56, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland.",mart.saarma@helsinki.fi,"Kalkkinen, Nisse/B-3923-2010; Voutilainen, Merja/D-9601-2014","Voutilainen, Merja/0000-0002-9832-7655",,,,35,187,199,5,38,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,5-Jul,2007,448,7149,,,,,73,77,,10.1038/nature05957,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,185OS,WOS:000247720900040,17611540,No,,,11/20/17

Ca2+ release channels were cloned more than 15 years ago(8,9), whereas the molecular identity of putative counter- ion channels remains unknown. Here we report two TRIC ( trimeric intracellular cation) channel subtypes that are differentially expressed on intracellular stores in animal cell types. TRIC subtypes contain three proposed transmembrane segments, and form homo-trimers with a bullet-like structure. Electrophysiological measurements with purified TRIC preparations identify a monovalent cation-selective channel. In TRIC-knockout mice suffering embryonic cardiac failure, mutant cardiac myocytes show severe dysfunction in intracellular Ca2+ handling. The TRIC-deficient skeletal muscle sarcoplasmic reticulum shows reduced K+ permeability, as well as altered Ca2+ 'spark' signalling and voltage-induced Ca2+ release.

In animals, miRNAs derive from characteristic hairpins in primary transcripts through two sequential RNase III-mediated cleavages; Drosha cleaves near the base of the stem to liberate a similar to 60-nucleotide pre-miRNA hairpin, then Dicer cleaves near the loop to generate a miRNA: miRNA* duplex(2,3). From that duplex, the mature miRNA is incorporated into the silencing complex. Here we identify an alternative pathway for miRNA biogenesis, in which certain debranched introns mimic the structural features of pre-miRNAs to enter the miRNA-processing pathway without Drosha-mediated cleavage. We call these pre-miRNAs/introns 'mirtrons', and have identified 14 mirtrons in Drosophila melanogaster and another four in Caenorhabditis elegans ( including the reclassification of mir-62). Some of these have been selectively maintained during evolution with patterns of sequence conservation suggesting important regulatory functions in the animal. The abundance of introns comparable in size to pre-miRNAs appears to have created a context favourable for the emergence of mirtrons in flies and nematodes. This suggests that other lineages with many similarly sized introns probably also have mirtrons, and that the mirtron pathway could have provided an early avenue for the emergence of miRNAs before the advent of Drosha.","MIT, Whitehead Inst Biomed Res, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; MIT, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; MIT, Dept Biol, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA","Bartel, DP (reprint author), MIT, Whitehead Inst Biomed Res, 9 Cambridge Ctr, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA.",dbartel@wi.mit.edu,,,"NIGMS NIH HHS [R01 GM067031, R01 GM067031-04]",,,30,773,849,6,63,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,5-Jul,2007,448,7149,,,,,83,86,,10.1038/nature05983,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,185OS,WOS:000247720900042,17589500,No,Y,N,11/20/17

Differential methylation of histone H3 and H4 lysyl residues regulates processes including heterochromatin formation, X-chromosome inactivation, genome imprinting, DNA repair and transcriptional regulation(3). The discovery of lysyl demethylases using flavin (amine oxidases)(4) or Fe( II) and 2-oxoglutarate as cofactors (2OG oxygenases)(5-7) has changed the view of methylation as a stable epigenetic marker. However, little is known about how the demethylases are selective for particular lysyl-containing sequences in specific methylation states, a key to understanding their functions. Here we reveal how human JMJD2A ( jumonji domain containing 2A), which is selective towards tri- and dimethylated histone H3 lysyl residues 9 and 36 (H3K9me3/me2 and H3K36me3/me2), discriminates between methylation states and achieves sequence selectivity for H3K9. We report structures of JMJD2A - Ni( II) - Zn( II) inhibitor complexes bound to tri-, di- and monomethyl forms of H3K9 and the trimethyl form of H3K36. The structures reveal a lysyl-binding pocket in which substrates are bound in distinct bent conformations involving the Zn-binding site. We propose a mechanism for achieving methylation state selectivity involving the orientation of the substrate methyl groups towards a ferryl intermediate. The results suggest distinct recognition mechanisms in different demethylase subfamilies and provide a starting point to develop chemical tools for drug discovery and to study and dissect the complexity of reversible histone methylation and its role in chromatin biology.","Univ Oxford, Struct Genom Consortium, Botnar Res Ctr, Oxford OX3 7LD, England; Univ Oxford, Dept Chem, Oxford OX1 3TA, England; Univ Oxford, Oxford Ctr Integrated Syst Biol, Oxford OX1 3TA, England; Univ Oxford, Dept Biochem, Oxford OX1 3QU, England; PAS Univ, Inst Catalysis & Surface Chem, PL-830239 Krakow, Poland","Schofield, CJ (reprint author), Univ Oxford, Struct Genom Consortium, Botnar Res Ctr, Oxford OX3 7LD, England.",christopher.schofield@chemistry.oxford.ac.uk,"; Rose, Nathan/A-9270-2013; Gileadi, Opher/F-1105-2013; McDonough, Michael/G-2744-2013; Borowski, Tomasz/E-8569-2016","Schofield, Christopher/0000-0002-0290-6565; Rose, Nathan/0000-0002-1871-1156; Gileadi, Opher/0000-0001-6886-898X; McDonough, Michael/0000-0003-4664-6942; Borowski, Tomasz/0000-0002-3450-3576; offer, john/0000-0002-2471-1216",Wellcome Trust,,,17,210,212,0,29,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,5-Jul,2007,448,7149,,,,,87,91,,10.1038/nature05971,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,185OS,WOS:000247720900043,17589501,No,,,11/20/17

Electrons are shuttled from photosystem I by means of ferredoxin (Fdx) to ferredoxin - thioredoxin reductase (FTR), which catalyses the two-electron-reduction of chloroplast thioredoxins (Trxs). These modify target enzyme activities by reduction, regulating carbon flow(2). FTR is unique in its use of a [4Fe - 4S] cluster and a proximal disulphide bridge in the conversion of a light signal into a thiol signal(2). We determined the structures of FTR in both its one- and its two-electron-reduced intermediate states and of four complexes in the pathway, including the ternary Fdx - FTR - Trx complex. Here we show that, in the first complex ( Fdx - FTR) of the pathway, the Fdx [2Fe - 2S] cluster is positioned suitably for electron transfer to the FTR [ 4Fe - 4S] centre. After the transfer of one electron, an intermediate is formed in which one sulphur atom of the FTR active site is free to attack a disulphide bridge in Trx and the other sulphur atom forms a fifth ligand for an iron atomin the FTR [ 4Fe - 4S] centre - a unique structure in biology. Fdx then delivers a second electron that cleaves the FTR - Trx heterodisulphide bond, which occurs in the Fdx - FTR - Trx complex. In this structure, the redox centres of the three proteins are aligned to maximize the efficiency of electron transfer from the Fdx [2Fe - 2S] cluster to the active-site disulphide of Trxs. These results provide a structural framework for understanding the mechanism of disulphide reduction by an iron - sulphur enzyme(3) and describe previously unknown interaction networks for both Fdx and Trx ( refs 4 - 6).","Natl Jewish Med & Res Ctr, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Integrated Dept Immunol, Denver, CO 80206 USA; Univ Colorado, Hlth Sci Ctr, Denver, CO 80206 USA; Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Ctr Biomed, Dept Mol Biol, S-75124 Uppsala, Sweden; Univ Neuchatel, Mol & Cellular Biol Lab, CH-2009 Neuchatel, Switzerland","Dai, SD (reprint author), Natl Jewish Med & Res Ctr, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Integrated Dept Immunol, 1400 Jackson St, Denver, CO 80206 USA.",dais@njc.org,"Friemann, Rosmarie/C-1018-2008; Glauser, Dominique/B-3918-2012","Friemann, Rosmarie/0000-0002-5633-2894; Glauser, Dominique/0000-0002-3228-7304",,,,51,67,74,3,21,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,5-Jul,2007,448,7149,,,,,92,102,,10.1038/nature05937,,11,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,185OS,WOS:000247720900044,17611542,No,,,11/20/17

Even whether the return flow is strongly localized as narrow upwellings or more broadly distributed remains uncertain. Here we show that the distribution of long-lived radiogenic isotopes along the world's mid-ocean ridges can be used to map geochemical domains, which reflect contrasting refilling modes of the upper mantle. New hafnium isotopic data along the Southwest Indian Ridge delineate a sharp transition between an Indian province with a strong lower-mantle isotopic flavour and a South Atlantic province contaminated by advection of upper-mantle material beneath the lithospheric roots of the Archaean African craton. The uppermantle of both domains appears to be refilled through the seismically defined anomaly underlying South Africa and the Afar plume. Because of the viscous drag exerted by the continental keels, refilling of the upper mantle in the Atlantic and Indian domains appears to be slow and confined to localized upwellings. By contrast, in the unencumbered Pacific domain, upwellings seem comparatively much wider and more rapid.","Univ Lyon 1, Ecole Normale Super Lyon, CNRS UMR 5570, Lab Sci Terre, F-69364 Lyon 07, France; British Geol Survey, Keyworth NG12 5GG, Notts, England; Univ Nantes, CNRS UMR 6112, Lab Planetol & Geodynam, F-44322 Nantes 03, France; Inst Phys Globe, Lab Geosci Marines, CNRS UMR 7154, F-75252 Paris 05, France","Meyzen, CM (reprint author), Univ Lyon 1, Ecole Normale Super Lyon, CNRS UMR 5570, Lab Sci Terre, 46 Allee Italie, F-69364 Lyon 07, France.",christine.meyzen@ens-lyon.fr,"ipgp, Laboratoire geoscien/F-8471-2010; lgm, ipgp/F-8820-2010; Blichert-Toft, Janne/C-8280-2012; Albarede, Francis/A-8871-2011; Meyzen, Christine/L-1941-2015","Blichert-Toft, Janne/0000-0002-4932-4079; Albarede, Francis/0000-0003-1994-1428; Meyzen, Christine/0000-0002-7529-5347",,,,52,61,62,1,25,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,28-Jun,2007,447,7148,,,,,1069,1074,,10.1038/nature05920,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,183HT,WOS:000247564600029,17597754,No,,,11/20/17

Moreover, neurons in the parietal cortex reveal the addition and subtraction of probabilistic quantities that underlie decision-making on this task.","Univ Washington, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Dept Physiol & Biophys, Natl Primate Res Ctr, Seattle, WA 98195 USA","Yang, T (reprint author), Univ Washington, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Dept Physiol & Biophys, Natl Primate Res Ctr, Box 357290, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.",tianming@u.washington.edu; shadlen@u.washington.edu,"Yang, Tianming/D-3582-2014","Yang, Tianming/0000-0001-6976-9246; Shadlen, Michael/0000-0002-2002-2210",NCRR NIH HHS [P51 RR000166]; NEI NIH HHS [R01 EY011378],,,57,249,255,5,39,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,28-Jun,2007,447,7148,,,,,1075,U2,,10.1038/nature05852,,8,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,183HT,WOS:000247564600030,17546027,No,,,11/20/17

Our studies suggest that the unusual reliance of these neurons on L-type Ca(v)1.3 Ca2+ channels to drive their maintained, rhythmic pacemaking renders them vulnerable to stressors thought to contribute to disease progression. The reliance on these channels increases with age, as juvenile dopamine-containing neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta use pacemaking mechanisms common to neurons not affected in Parkinson's disease. These mechanisms remain latent in adulthood, and blocking Ca(v)1.3 Ca2+ channels in adult neurons induces a reversion to the juvenile form of pacemaking. Such blocking ('rejuvenation') protects these neurons in both in vitro and in vivo models of Parkinson's disease, pointing to a new strategy that could slow or stop the progression of the disease.","Northwestern Univ, Dept Physiol, Feinberg Sch Med, Chicago, IL 60611 USA; Rosalind Franklin Univ Med & Sci, Chicago Med Sch, Dept Mol & Cellular Pharmacol, Chicago, IL 60064 USA","Surmeier, DJ (reprint author), Northwestern Univ, Dept Physiol, Feinberg Sch Med, Chicago, IL 60611 USA.",j-surmeier@northwestern.edu,,,NIGMS NIH HHS [T32 GM008152],,,66,429,437,4,50,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,28-Jun,2007,447,7148,,,,,1081,U5,,10.1038/nature05865,,9,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,183HT,WOS:000247564600031,17558391,No,Y,N,11/20/17

Known susceptibility genes account for less than 25% of the familial risk of breast cancer, and the residual genetic variance is likely to be due to variants conferring more moderate risks. To identify further susceptibility alleles, we conducted a two-stage genome-wide association study in 4,398 breast cancer cases and 4,316 controls, followed by a third stage in which 30 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were tested for confirmation in 21,860 cases and 22,578 controls from 22 studies. We used 227,876 SNPs that were estimated to correlate with 77% of known common SNPs in Europeans at r(2) > 0.5. SNPs in five novel independent loci exhibited strong and consistent evidence of association with breast cancer (P < 10(-7)). Four of these contain plausible causative genes (FGFR2, TNRC9, MAP3K1 and LSP1). At the second stage, 1,792 SNPs were significant at the P < 0.05 level compared with an estimated 1,343 that would be expected by chance, indicating that many additional common susceptibility alleles may be identifiable by this approach.","Univ Cambridge, Dept Publ Hlth & Primary Care, CR UK Genet Epidemiol Unit, Cambridge CB1 8RN, England;

The outflows from these stars create spherical envelopes, which foster gas-phase chemistry(3-5). The chemical complexity in circumstellar shells was originally thought to be dominated by the elemental carbon to oxygen ratio(6). Observations have suggested that envelopes with more carbon than oxygen have a significantly greater abundance of molecules than their oxygen-rich analogues(7). Here we report observations of molecules in the oxygen-rich shell of the red supergiant star VY Canis Majoris (VY CMa). A variety of unexpected chemical compounds have been identified, including NaCl, PN, HNC and HCO+. From the spectral line profiles, the molecules can be distinguished as arising from three distinct kinematic regions: a spherical outflow, a tightly collimated, blue-shifted expansion, and a directed, red-shifted flow. Certain species (SiO, PN and NaCl) exclusively trace the spherical flow, whereas HNC and sulphur-bearing molecules (amongst others) are selectively created in the two expansions, perhaps arising from shock waves. CO, HCN, CS and HCO+ exist in all three components. Despite the oxygen-rich environment, HCN seems to be as abundant as CO. These results suggest that oxygen-rich shells may be as chemically diverse as their carbon counterparts.","Univ Arizona, Astrobiol Inst, NASA, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA; Univ Arizona, Dept Chem, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA; Univ Arizona, Arizona Radio Observ, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA; Univ Arizona, Dept Astron, Steward Observ, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA","Ziurys, LM (reprint author), Univ Arizona, Astrobiol Inst, NASA, 1306 E Univ Blvd, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA.",lziurys@as.arizona.edu,"Milam, Stefanie/D-1092-2012","Milam, Stefanie/0000-0001-7694-4129",,,,30,66,67,0,16,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,28-Jun,2007,447,7148,,,,,1094,1097,,10.1038/nature05905,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,183HT,WOS:000247564600033,17597755,No,,,11/20/17

Current advanced near-field imaging techniques using fibre-optic scattering probes(1,2) have already achieved spatial resolution down to the 20-nm range. Recently reported far-field approaches for optical microscopy, including stimulated emission depletion(3), structured illumination(4), and photoactivated localization microscopy(5), have enabled impressive, theoretically unlimited spatial resolution of fluorescent bio-molecular complexes. Previous work with laser tweezers(6-8) has suggested that optical traps could be used to create novel spatial probes and sensors. Inorganic nanowires have diameters substantially below the wavelength of visible light and have electronic and optical properties(9,10) that make them ideal for subwavelength laser and imaging technology. Here we report the development of an electrode-free, continuously tunable coherent visible light source compatible with physiological environments, from individual potassium niobate (KNbO(3)) nanowires. These wires exhibit efficient second harmonic generation, and act as frequency converters, allowing the local synthesis of a wide range of colours via sum and difference frequency generation. We use this tunable nanometric light source to implement a novel form of subwavelength microscopy, in which an infrared laser is used to optically trap and scan a nanowire over a sample, suggesting a wide range of potential applications in physics, chemistry, materials science and biology.","Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Phys, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Chem, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; Univ Calif Berkeley, Biophys Grad Grp, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; Univ Calif Berkeley, Lawrence Berkeley Lab, Phys Biosci Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; Univ Calif Berkeley, Lawrence Berkeley Lab, Div Mat Sci, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; Sony Corp, Mat Labs, Kanagawa 2430021, Japan","Liphardt, J (reprint author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Phys, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",liphardt@physics.berkeley.edu; p_yang@berkeley.edu,"Radenovic, Aleksandra/C-5350-2011; Liphardt, Jan/A-5906-2012; Pauzauskie, Peter/A-1316-2014","Liphardt, Jan/0000-0003-2835-5025",,,,30,366,370,21,290,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,28-Jun,2007,447,7148,,,,,1098,U8,,10.1038/nature05921,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,183HT,WOS:000247564600034,17597756,No,Y,N,11/20/17

Basalts from the Earth and the Moon do indeed appear to have iron isotopic compositions that are slightly heavy relative to those from Mars, Vesta and primitive undifferentiated meteorites(1-4) (chondrites). Explanations for these differences have included evaporation during the 'giant impact' that created the Moon (when a Mars-sized body collided with the young Earth). However, lithium(5) and magnesium(6), lighter elements with comparable volatility(7-9), reveal no such differences, rendering evaporation unlikely as an explanation. Here we show that the silicon isotopic compositions of basaltic rocks from the Earth and the Moon are also distinctly heavy. A likely cause is that silicon is one of the light elements in the Earth's core. We show that both the direction and magnitude of the silicon isotopic effect are in accord with current theory(10) based on the stiffness of bonding in metal and silicate. The similar isotopic composition of the bulk silicate Earth and the Moon is consistent with the recent proposal(11) that there was large-scale isotopic equilibration during the giant impact. We conclude that Si was already incorporated as a light element in the Earth's core before the Moon formed.","Univ Oxford, Dept Earth Sci, Oxford OX1 3PR, England; Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Earth & Space Sci, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; ETH Zentrum NW, Dept Earth Sci, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland","Halliday, AN (reprint author), Univ Oxford, Dept Earth Sci, S Parks Rd, Oxford OX1 3PR, England.",alexh@earth.ox.ac.uk,"Schauble, Edwin/E-7812-2012","Georg, Bastian/0000-0002-3109-1860",,,,30,175,178,10,52,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,28-Jun,2007,447,7148,,,,,1102,1106,,10.1038/nature05927,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,183HT,WOS:000247564600035,17597757,No,,,11/20/17

B.",,,Sexually antagonistic genetic variation for fitness in red deer,NATURE,,,English,Article,,,,,,,NATURAL-POPULATIONS; ONTOGENIC CONFLICT; MATE CHOICE; SELECTION; HERITABILITY; DIMORPHISM; PLEIOTROPY; EVOLUTION; SEXES; WILD,"Evolutionary theory predicts the depletion of genetic variation in natural populations as a result of the effects of selection, but genetic variation is nevertheless abundant for many traits that are under directional or stabilizing selection(1). Evolutionary geneticists commonly try to explain this paradox with mechanisms that lead to a balance between mutation and selection(2). However, theoretical predictions of equilibrium genetic variance under mutation-selection balance are usually lower than the observed values, and the reason for this is unknown(3). The potential role of sexually antagonistic selection in maintaining genetic variation has received little attention in this debate, surprisingly given its potential ubiquity in dioecious organisms. At fitness-related loci, a given genotype may be selected in opposite directions in the two sexes. Such sexually antagonistic selection will reduce the otherwise-expected positive genetic correlation between male and female fitness(4). Both theory(5-7) and experimental data(8-12) suggest that males and females of the same species may have divergent genetic optima, but supporting data from wild populations are still scarce(13-15). Here we present evidence for sexually antagonistic fitness variation in a natural population, using data from a long-term study of red deer (Cervus elaphus). We show that male red deer with relatively high fitness fathered, on average, daughters with relatively low fitness. This was due to a negative genetic correlation between estimates of fitness in males and females. In particular, we show that selection favours males that carry low breeding values for female fitness. Our results demonstrate that sexually antagonistic selection can lead to a trade-off between the optimal genotypes for males and females; this mechanism will have profound effects on the operation of selection and the maintenance of genetic variation in natural populations.","Univ Edinburgh, Inst Evolutionary Biol, Edinburgh EH9 3JT, Midlothian, Scotland; Univ Cambridge, Dept Zool, Cambridge CB2 3EJ, England; Univ Oxford, Dept Zool, Edward Grey Inst, Oxford OX1 3PS, England; Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Ctr Populat Biol, Ascot SL5 7PY, Berks, England; Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Div Biol, Ascot SL5 7PY, Berks, England","Foerster, K (reprint author), Univ Edinburgh, Inst Evolutionary Biol, Edinburgh EH9 3JT, Midlothian, Scotland.",foerster@orn.mpg.de; loeske.kruuk@ed.ac.uk,"Sheldon, Ben/A-8056-2010; Pemberton, Josephine/F-3100-2010; Kruuk, Loeske/J-3295-2012","Sheldon, Ben/0000-0002-5240-7828; Coulson, Tim/0000-0001-9371-9003",,,,31,199,202,5,125,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,28-Jun,2007,447,7148,,,,,1107,U9,,10.1038/nature05912,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,183HT,WOS:000247564600036,17597758,No,Y,N,11/20/17

Although recent studies have shown how dopamine neurons respond to rewards and sensory stimuli predicting reward(1,5,6), it is unclear which parts of the brain provide dopamine neurons with signals necessary for these actions. Here we show that the primate lateral habenula, part of the structure called the epithalamus, is a major candidate for a source of negative reward-related signals in dopamine neurons. We recorded the activity of habenula neurons and dopamine neurons while rhesus monkeys were performing a visually guided saccade task with positionally biased reward outcomes(7). Many habenula neurons were excited by a no-reward-predicting target and inhibited by a reward-predicting target. In contrast, dopamine neurons were excited and inhibited by reward-predicting and no-reward-predicting targets, respectively. Each time the rewarded and unrewarded positions were reversed, both habenula and dopamine neurons reversed their responses as the bias in saccade latency reversed. In unrewarded trials, the excitation of habenula neurons started earlier than the inhibition of dopamine neurons. Furthermore, weak electrical stimulation of the lateral habenula elicited strong inhibitions in dopamine neurons. These results suggest that the inhibitory input from the lateral habenula plays an important role in determining the reward-related activity of dopamine neurons.","NEI, Sensorimotor Res Lab, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA","Hikosaka, O (reprint author), NEI, Sensorimotor Res Lab, NIH, Bldg 10, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA.",oh@lsr.nei.nih.gov,,,,,,31,496,510,1,36,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,28-Jun,2007,447,7148,,,,,1111,U11,,10.1038/nature05860,,7,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,183HT,WOS:000247564600037,17522629,No,Y,N,11/20/17

In adipose tissue chronic overnutrition leads to macrophage infiltration, resulting in local inflammation that potentiates insulin resistance(3,4). For instance, transgenic expression of Mcp1 (also known as chemokine ligand 2, Ccl2) in adipose tissue increases macrophage infiltration, inflammation and insulin resistance(5,6). Conversely, disruption of Mcp1 or its receptor Ccr2 impairs migration of macrophages into adipose tissue, thereby lowering adipose tissue inflammation and improving insulin sensitivity(5,7). These findings together suggest a correlation between macrophage content in adipose tissue and insulin resistance. However, resident macrophages in tissues display tremendous heterogeneity in their activities and functions, primarily reflecting their local metabolic and immune microenvironment(8). While Mcp1 directs recruitment of pro-inflammatory classically activated macrophages to sites of tissue damage(5,8), resident macrophages, such as those present in the adipose tissue of lean mice, display the alternatively activated phenotype(9). Despite their higher capacity to repair tissue(10), the precise role of alternatively activated macrophages in obesity-induced insulin resistance remains unknown. Using mice with macrophage-specific deletion of the peroxisome proliferator activated receptor-gamma (PPAR gamma), we showhere that PPAR gamma is required for maturation of alternatively activated macrophages. Disruption of PPAR gamma in myeloid cells impairs alternative macrophage activation, and predisposes these animals to development of diet-induced obesity, insulin resistance, and glucose intolerance. Furthermore, gene expression profiling revealed that downregulation of oxidative phosphorylation gene expression in skeletal muscle and liver leads to decreased insulin sensitivity in these tissues. Together, our findings suggest that resident alternatively activated macrophages have a beneficial role in regulating nutrient homeostasis and suggest that macrophage polarization towards the alternative state might be a useful strategy for treating type 2 diabetes.","Stanford Univ, Dept Med, Sch Med, Div Endocrinol Metab & Gerontol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; Stanford Univ, Grad Program Immunol, Sch Med, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; Stanford Univ, Dept Genet, Sch Med, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; Univ Cape Town, Observ, Fac Hlth Sci, Inst Infect Dis & Mol Med,Div Immunol, ZA-7925 Cape Town, South Africa; Columbia Univ Coll Phys & Surg, Dept Med, Naomi Berrie Diabet Ctr, New York, NY 10032 USA","Chawla, A (reprint author), Stanford Univ, Dept Med, Sch Med, Div Endocrinol Metab & Gerontol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",achawla@stanford.edu,,,"NHLBI NIH HHS [R01 HL076746, R01 HL076746-01, R01 HL076746-02, R01 HL076746-03, R01 HL076746-04, R01 HL076746-05]; NIAID NIH HHS [AI07290, F31 AI066402, T32 AI007290]; NIDDK NIH HHS [K08 DK062386-06, K08 DK062386, K08 DK062386-05, R01 DK066525, R01 DK066525-05, R01 DK076760]",,,30,961,1013,10,81,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,28-Jun,2007,447,7148,,,,,1116,U12,,10.1038/nature05894,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,183HT,WOS:000247564600038,17515919,No,Y,N,11/20/17

During autophagy, portions of the cytoplasm are sequestered by double-membraned vesicles called autophagosomes, and are degraded after fusion with lysosomes for subsequent recycling(4). In vertebrates, this process acts as a pro-survival or pro-death mechanism in different physiological and pathological conditions, such as neurodegeneration and cancer(2,5-7); however, the roles of autophagy during embryonic development are still largely uncharacterized(3). Beclin1 (Becn1; coiled-coil, myosin-like BCL2-interacting protein) is a principal regulator in autophagosome formation, and its deficiency results in early embryonic lethality(8,9). Here we show that Ambra1 (activating molecule in Beclin1-regulated autophagy), a large, previously unknown protein bearing a WD40 domain at its amino terminus, regulates autophagy and has a crucial role in embryogenesis. We found that Ambra1 is a positive regulator of the Becn1-dependent programme of autophagy, as revealed by its overexpression and by RNA interference experiments in vitro. Notably, Ambra1 functional deficiency in mouse embryos leads to severe neural tube defects associated with autophagy impairment, accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins, unbalanced cell proliferation and excessive apoptotic cell death. In addition to identifying a new and essential element regulating the autophagy programme, our results provide in vivo evidence supporting the existence of a complex interplay between autophagy, cell growth and cell death required for neural development in mammals.","Univ Roma Tor Vergata, Dept Biol, Dulbecco Telethon Inst, I-00133 Rome, Italy; Max Planck Inst Biophys Chem, Dept Mol Cell Biol, D-37077 Gottingen, Germany; IRCCS L Spallanzani, Natl Inst Infect Dis, I-00149 Rome, Italy; IRCCS, Fdn St Lucia, Lab Mol Neuroembryol, I-00143 Rome, Italy; Univ Gottingen, Dept Anat & Embryol, D-37085 Gottingen, Germany","Cecconi, F (reprint author), Univ Roma Tor Vergata, Dept Biol, Dulbecco Telethon Inst, I-00133 Rome, Italy.",kchowdh@gwdg.de; francesco.cecconi@uniroma2.it,"Ucar, Ahmet/E-8981-2012; Nardacci, Roberta/K-6555-2016; Corazzari, Marco/K-6422-2016; Piacentini, Mauro/I-2411-2016","Nardacci, Roberta/0000-0002-9209-1207; Corazzari, Marco/0000-0002-6246-5968; Piacentini, Mauro/0000-0003-2919-1296; DI BARTOLOMEO, Sabrina/0000-0002-5748-1541; Ucar, Ahmet/0000-0002-6551-3486; romagnoli, alessandra/0000-0003-4946-6138; Cecconi, Francesco/0000-0002-5614-4359",Telethon [TCR04004],,,34,482,503,6,59,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,28-Jun,2007,447,7148,,,,,1121,U14,,10.1038/nature05925,,7,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,183HT,WOS:000247564600039,17589504,No,,,11/20/17

They are released by a Dicer nuclease as a 21-24-nucleotide RNA duplex from a precursor in which an imperfectly matched inverted repeat forms a partly double-stranded region. One of the two strands is then recruited by an Argonaute nuclease that is the effector protein of the silencing mechanism. Short interfering RNAs (siRNAs), which are similar to miRNAs, are also produced by Dicer but the precursors are perfectly double-stranded RNA. These siRNAs guide post-transcriptional regulation, as with miRNAs, and epigenetic genome modification. Diverse eukaryotes including fungi, plants, protozoans and metazoans produce siRNAs(2-5) but, until now, miRNAs have not been described in unicellular organisms and it has been suggested that they evolved together with multicellularity in separate plant and animal lineages(6). Here we show that the unicellular alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii contains miRNAs, putative evolutionary precursors of miRNAs and species of siRNAs resembling those in higher plants.

Here we describe a family of miRNAs, miR-34a-c, whose expression reflected p53 status. Genes encoding miRNAs in the miR-34 family are direct transcriptional targets of p53, whose induction by DNA damage and oncogenic stress depends on p53 both in vitro and in vivo. Ectopic expression of miR-34 induces cell cycle arrest in both primary and tumour-derived cell lines, which is consistent with the observed ability of miR-34 to downregulate a programme of genes promoting cell cycle progression.

Ubiquitin conjugation involves adenylation and thioesterification of the carboxy-terminal carboxylate of ubiquitin by the E1-activating enzyme Ube1 (Uba1 in yeast), followed by ubiquitin transfer to an E2-conjugating enzyme through a trans-thiolation reaction(4-7). Charged E2s function with E3s to ubiquitinate substrates(1). It is currently thought that Ube1/Uba1 is the sole E1 for charging of E2s with ubiquitin in animals and fungi(1,8). Here we identify a divergent E1 in vertebrates and sea urchin, Uba6, which specifically activates ubiquitin but not other UBLs in vitro and in vivo. Human Uba6 and Ube1 have distinct preferences for E2 charging in vitro, and their specificity depends in part on their C-terminal ubiquitin-fold domains, which recruit E2s. In tissue culture cells, Uba6 is required for charging a previously uncharacterized Uba6-specific E2 (Use1), whereas Ube1 is required for charging the cell-cycle E2s Cdc34A and Cdc34B. Our data reveal unexpected complexity in the pathways that control the conjugation of ubiquitin, in which dual E1s orchestrate the charging of distinct cohorts of E2s.","Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Pathol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Cell Biol, Boston, MA 02115 USA","Harper, JW (reprint author), Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Pathol, 77 Ave Louis Pasteur, Boston, MA 02115 USA.",wade_harper@hms.harvard.edu,,,NIA NIH HHS [R01 AG011085],,,30,165,169,2,17,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,28-Jun,2007,447,7148,,,,,1135,U17,,10.1038/nature05902,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,183HT,WOS:000247564600042,17597759,No,,,11/20/17

Given the functional diversity of TLR-induced genes, we proposed that additional, gene-specific regulatory mechanisms exist to allow individual aspects of the TLR-induced response to be differentially regulated. Using an in vitro system of lipopolysaccharide tolerance in murine macrophages, we show that TLR-induced genes fall into two categories on the basis of their functions and regulatory requirements. We demonstrate that representatives from the two classes acquire distinct patterns of TLR-induced chromatin modifications. These gene-specific chromatin modifications are associated with transient silencing of one class of genes, which includes pro-inflammatory mediators, and priming of the second class, which includes antimicrobial effectors. These findings illustrate an adaptive response in macrophages and reveal component-specific regulation of inflammation.","Yale Univ, Sch Med, Howard Hughes Med Inst, New Haven, CT 06405 USA; Yale Univ, Sch Med, Dept Immunobiol, New Haven, CT 06405 USA","Medzhitov, R (reprint author), Yale Univ, Sch Med, Howard Hughes Med Inst, New Haven, CT 06405 USA.",ruslan.medzhitov@yale.edu,,,,,,37,544,565,4,42,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,21-Jun,2007,447,7147,,,,,972,U4,,10.1038/nature05836,,8,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,180NU,WOS:000247373100040,17538624,No,Y,N,11/20/17

For fuels to be useful in the transportation sector, they must have specific physical properties that allow for efficient distribution, storage and combustion; these properties are currently fulfilled by non-renewable petroleum-derived liquid fuels. Ethanol, the only renewable liquid fuel currently produced in large quantities, suffers from several limitations, including low energy density, high volatility, and contamination by the absorption of water from the atmosphere. Here we present a catalytic strategy for the production of 2,5-dimethylfuran from fructose ( a carbohydrate obtained directly from biomass or by the isomerization of glucose) for use as a liquid transportation fuel. Compared to ethanol, 2,5-dimethylfuran has a higher energy density ( by 40 per cent), a higher boiling point ( by 20 K), and is not soluble in water. This catalytic strategy creates a route for transforming abundant renewable biomass resources(1,2) into a liquid fuel suitable for the transportation sector, and may diminish our reliance on petroleum.","Univ Wisconsin, Dept Biol & Chem Engn, Madison, WI 53706 USA","Dumesic, JA (reprint author), Univ Wisconsin, Dept Biol & Chem Engn, Madison, WI 53706 USA.",dumesic@engr.wisc.edu,"Roman-Leshkov, Yuriy/E-1387-2014","Roman-Leshkov, Yuriy/0000-0002-0025-4233",,,,25,1049,1101,40,583,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,21-Jun,2007,447,7147,,,,,982,U5,,10.1038/nature05923,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,180NU,WOS:000247373100042,17581580,No,Y,N,11/20/17

Deciphering the history of the circulation regime in the Arctic Ocean has long been prevented by the lack of data from cores of Cenozoic sediments from the Arctic's deep-sea floor. Similarly, the timing of the opening of a connection between the northern North Atlantic and the Arctic Ocean, permitting deep-water exchange, has been poorly constrained. This situation changed when the first drill cores were recovered from the central Arctic Ocean(2). Here we use these cores to show that the transition from poorly oxygenated to fully oxygenated ('ventilated') conditions in the Arctic Ocean occurred during the later part of early Miocene times. We attribute this pronounced change in ventilation regime to the opening of the Fram Strait. A palaeo-geographic and palaeo-bathymetric reconstruction of the Arctic Ocean, together with a physical oceanographic analysis of the evolving strait and sill conditions in the Fram Strait, suggests that the Arctic Ocean went from an oxygen-poor 'lake stage', to a transitional 'estuarine sea' phase with variable ventilation, and finally to the fully ventilated 'ocean' phase 17.5 Myr ago. The timing of this palaeo-oceanographic change coincides with the onset of the middle Miocene climatic optimum(3), although it remains unclear if there is a causal relationship between these two events.","Stockholm Univ, Dept Geol & Geochem, SE-10691 Stockholm, Sweden; Stockholm Univ, Dept Meteorol, SE-10691 Stockholm, Sweden; Finnish Inst Marine Res, FI-00561 Helsinki, Finland; Univ Kiel, IFM GEOMAR, Leibniz Inst MArine Sci, DE-24148 Kiel, Germany; Univ New Hampshire, Ctr Coastal & Ocean Mapping, Durham, NH 03824 USA; Alfred Wegener Inst Polar Res, DE-27570 Bremerhaven, Germany; Univ Utrecht, Palaeobot & Palynol Lab, NL-3584 Utrecht, Netherlands; Univ Rhode Isl, Grad Sch Oceanog, Narragansett, RI 02882 USA","Jakobsson, M (reprint author), Stockholm Univ, Dept Geol & Geochem, SE-10691 Stockholm, Sweden.",martin.jakobsson@geo.su.se,"O'Regan, Matt/B-2157-2010; Jakobsson, Martin/F-6214-2010; Brinkhuis, Henk/B-4223-2009; Nycander, Jonas/E-1334-2011","Jakobsson, Martin/0000-0002-9033-3559; Jokat, Wilfried/0000-0002-7793-5854; Nycander, Jonas/0000-0002-4414-6859; O'Regan, Matt/0000-0002-6046-1488; Mayer, Larry/0000-0003-1846-5140",,,,29,115,117,3,22,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,21-Jun,2007,447,7147,,,,,986,990,,10.1038/nature05924,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,180NU,WOS:000247373100043,17581581,No,,,11/20/17

The geophysical detection of such a layer has, however, proved difficult. Magnetotelluric and geomagnetic depth sounding are geophysical methods sensitive to mantle melt. Here we use these methods to search for a distinct structure near 410-km depth. We calculate one-dimensional forward models of the response of electrical conductivity depth profiles, based on mineral physics studies of the effect of incorporating hydrogen in upper-mantle and transition-zone minerals. These models indicate that a melt layer at 410-km depth is consistent with regional magnetotelluric and geomagnetic depth sounding data from the southwestern United States (Tucson)(2). The 410-km-deep melt layer in this model has a conductance of 3.0 x 10(4) S and an estimated thickness of 5 - 30 km. This is the only regional data set that we have examined for which such a melt layer structure was found, consistent with regional seismic studies(3). We infer that the hypothesized transition-zone water filter(1) occurs regionally, but that such a layer is unlikely to be a global feature.","Arizona State Univ, Sch Earth & Space Explorat, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA","Tyburczy, JA (reprint author), Arizona State Univ, Sch Earth & Space Explorat, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA.",jim.tyburczy@asu.edu,,,,,,27,38,41,1,18,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,21-Jun,2007,447,7147,,,,,991,994,,10.1038/nature05922,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,180NU,WOS:000247373100044,17581582,No,,,11/20/17

It is often assumed that P limitation also applies to young tropical forests, but nitrogen (N) losses during land-use change may alter the stoichiometric balance of nutrient cycling processes. In the Amazon basin, about 16% of the original forest area has been cleared(6), and about 30 - 50% of cleared land is estimated now to be in some stage of secondary forest succession following agricultural abandonment(7). Here we use forest age chronosequences to demonstrate that young successional forests growing after agricultural abandonment on highly weathered lowland tropical soils exhibit conservative N-cycling properties much like those of N-limited forests on younger soils in temperate latitudes. As secondary succession progresses, N-cycling properties recover and the dominance of a conservative P cycle typical of mature lowland tropical forests re-emerges. These successional shifts in N: P cycling ratios with forest age provide a mechanistic explanation for initially lower and then gradually increasing soil emissions of the greenhouse gas nitrous oxide (N2O). The patterns of N and P cycling during secondary forest succession, demonstrated here over decadal timescales, are similar to N- and P-cycling patterns during primary succession as soils age over thousands and millions of years, thus revealing that N availability in terrestrial ecosystems is ephemeral and can be disrupted by either natural or anthropogenic disturbances at several timescales.","EMBRAPA Amazonia Oriental, BR-66095100 Belem, Para, Brazil; Woods Hole Res Ctr, Falmouth, MA 02540 USA; Univ Sao Paulo, CENA, BR-13416000 Piracicaba, SP, Brazil; Museu Paraensr Emilio Goeldi, Dept Bot, BR-66040179 Belem, Para, Brazil","Davidson, EA (reprint author), Woods Hole Res Ctr, 149 Woods Hole Rd, Falmouth, MA 02540 USA.",edavidson@whrc.org,"Martinelli, Luiz/F-7870-2011; Ometto, Jean/B-3351-2013; Davidson, Eric/K-4984-2013; Nardoto, Gabriela/J-7459-2012","Martinelli, Luiz/0000-0002-7103-7551; Davidson, Eric/0000-0002-8525-8697; Nardoto, Gabriela/0000-0001-8062-7417",,,,29,189,206,4,124,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,21-Jun,2007,447,7147,,,,,995,U6,,10.1038/nature05900,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,180NU,WOS:000247373100045,17581583,No,,,11/20/17

To first order, the oceanic system is at equilibrium such that what goes down must come up(2). Because the export flux is difficult to measure directly, it is routinely estimated indirectly by quantifying the amount of phytoplankton growth, or primary production, fuelled by the upward flux of nitrate(3). To do so it is necessary to take into account other sources of biologically available nitrogen. However, the generation of nitrate by nitrification in surface waters has only recently received attention. Here we perform the first synthesis of open-ocean measurements of the specific rate of surface nitrification(4-12) and use these to configure a global biogeochemical model(13,14) to quantify the global role of nitrification. We show that for much of the world ocean a substantial fraction of the nitrate taken up is generated through recent nitrification near the surface. At the global scale, nitrification accounts for about half of the nitrate consumed by growing phytoplankton. A consequence is that many previous attempts to quantify marine carbon export, particularly those based on inappropriate use of the f-ratio ( a measure of the efficiency of the 'biological pump'), are significant overestimates.","Natl Oceanog Ctr, Southampton SO14 3ZH, Hants, England; Ctr Oceanol Marseille, Lab Oceanog & Biogeochim, F-13288 Marseille, France; Univ Concepcion, Dept Oceanog, Lab Proc Oceanog & Clima, Concepcion, Chile; Univ Concepcion, Ctr Invest Oceanog Pacifico Sur Oriental, Concepcion, Chile; Plymouth Marine Lab, Plymouth PL1 3DH, Devon, England","Yool, A (reprint author), Natl Oceanog Ctr, European Way, Southampton SO14 3ZH, Hants, England.",axy@noc.soton.ac.uk,"Fernandez, Camila/F-6938-2010; Yool, Andrew/B-4799-2012","Yool, Andrew/0000-0002-9879-2776",,,,30,199,203,15,97,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,21-Jun,2007,447,7147,,,,,999,1002,,10.1038/nature05885,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,180NU,WOS:000247373100046,17581584,No,Y,N,11/20/17

In murine embryonic stem cell differentiation assays, PGE2 caused amplification of multipotent progenitors. Furthermore, ex vivo exposure to stabilized PGE2 enhanced spleen colony forming units at day 12 post transplant and increased the frequency of long-term repopulating HSCs present in murine bone marrow after limiting dilution competitive transplantation.

In the insulin-resistant or diabetic state, the liver is unresponsive to the actions of insulin with regard to the suppression of glucose output but continues to produce large amounts of lipid, the latter mimicking the fed, insulin-replete condition(4,5). The disordered distribution of lipids contributes to the cardiovascular disease that is the greatest cause of mortality of type 2 diabetes mellitus(6,7). Yet the precise signal transduction pathways by which insulin regulates hepatic lipid synthesis and degradation remain largely unknown. Here we describe a mechanism by which insulin, through the intermediary protein kinase Akt2/protein kinase B (PKB)-beta, elicits the phosphorylation and inhibition of the transcriptional coactivator peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-coactivator 1 alpha (PGC-1 alpha), a global regulator of hepatic metabolism during fasting. Phosphorylation prevents the recruitment of PGC-1 alpha to the cognate promoters, impairing its ability to promote gluconeogenesis and fatty acid oxidation.

Although there is relatively ample information on the biochemical characteristics of AMPK, not enough data exist on the in vivo function of the kinase. Here, using the Drosophila model system, we generated the first animal model with no AMPK activity and discovered physiological functions of the kinase. Surprisingly, AMPK-null mutants were lethal with severe abnormalities in cell polarity and mitosis, similar to those of lkb1-null mutants. Constitutive activation of AMPK restored many of the phenotypes of lkb1-null mutants, suggesting that AMPK mediates the polarity- and mitosis-controlling functions of the LKB1 serine/threonine kinase. Interestingly, the regulatory site of non-muscle myosin regulatory light chain (MRLC; also known as MLC2)(2,3) was directly phosphorylated by AMPK. Moreover, the phosphomimetic mutant of MRLC3 rescued the AMPK-null defects in cell polarity and mitosis, suggesting MRLC is a critical downstream target of AMPK. Furthermore, the activation of AMPK by energy deprivation was sufficient to cause dramatic changes in cell shape, inducing complete polarization and brush border formation in the human LS174T cell line, through the phosphorylation of MRLC. Taken together, our results demonstrate that AMPK has highly conserved roles across metazoan species not only in the control of metabolism, but also in the regulation of cellular structures.","Korea Adv Inst Sci & Technol, Natl Creat Res Initiat Ctr Cell Growth Regulat, Taejon 305701, South Korea; Korea Adv Inst Sci & Technol, Dept Biol Sci, Taejon 305701, South Korea; CNRS, Ctr Genet Mol, F-91198 Gif Sur Yvette, France; Korea Basic Sci Inst, Div Electron Microscop Res, Taejon 305333, South Korea; Chungnam Natl Univ, Sch Med, Dept Pathol, Taejon 301721, South Korea; Chungnam Natl Univ, Sch Med, Dept Internal Med, Taejon 301721, South Korea; GenExel, Taejon 305701, South Korea","Chung, JK (reprint author), Korea Adv Inst Sci & Technol, Natl Creat Res Initiat Ctr Cell Growth Regulat, 373-1 Kusong Dong, Taejon 305701, South Korea.",jchung@kaist.ac.kr,"; Koh, Hyoungjong/C-1615-2012","Koh, Hyongjong/0000-0003-2594-4799; Lee, Soo Young/0000-0003-1524-836X; Lee, Jun Hee/0000-0002-2200-6011",,,,21,276,282,2,42,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,21-Jun,2007,447,7147,,,,,1017,U9,,10.1038/nature05828,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,180NU,WOS:000247373100050,17486097,No,,,11/20/17

Many eukaryotic proteins are disordered under physiological conditions, and fold into ordered structures only on binding to their cellular targets(3-6). The mechanism by which folding is coupled to binding is poorly understood, but it has been hypothesized on theoretical grounds that the binding kinetics may be enhanced by a 'fly-casting' effect, where the disordered protein binds weakly and non-specifically to its target and folds as it approaches the cognate binding site(7). Here we show, using NMR titrations and N-15 relaxation dispersion, that the phosphorylated kinase inducible activation domain (pKID) of the transcription factor CREB forms an ensemble of transient encounter complexes on binding to the KIX domain of the CREB binding protein. The encounter complexes are stabilized primarily by non-specific hydrophobic contacts, and evolve by way of an intermediate to the fully bound state without dissociation from KIX. The carboxy-terminal helix of pKID is only partially folded in the intermediate, and becomes stabilized by intermolecular interactions formed in the final bound state. Future applications of our method will provide new understanding of the molecular mechanisms by which intrinsically disordered proteins perform their diverse biological functions.","Scripps Res Inst, Dept Mol Biol, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; Scripps Res Inst, Skaggs Inst Chem Biol, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; Suntory Inst Bioorgan Res, Shimamoto, Osaka 6188503, Japan","Wright, PE (reprint author), Scripps Res Inst, Dept Mol Biol, 10550 N Torrey Pines Rd, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA.",wright@scripps.edu,,"Wright, Peter/0000-0002-1368-0223; Dyson, Helen Jane/0000-0001-6855-3398",,,,33,583,592,13,147,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,21-Jun,2007,447,7147,,,,,1021,U11,,10.1038/nature05858,,7,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,180NU,WOS:000247373100051,17522630,No,Y,N,11/20/17

We characterized the glutamate racemases of several pathogenic bacteria using structural and biochemical approaches. Here we describe three distinct mechanisms of regulation for the family of glutamate racemases: allosteric activation by metabolic precursors, kinetic regulation through substrate inhibition, and D-glutamate recycling using a D-amino acid transaminase. In a search for selective inhibitors, we identified a series of uncompetitive inhibitors specifically targeting Helicobacter pylori glutamate racemase that bind to a cryptic allosteric site, and used these inhibitors to probe the mechanistic and dynamic features of the enzyme.

To elucidate how miRNAs mediate their repressive effects, we performed biochemical and functional assays to identify new factors in the miRNA pathway. Here we show that human RISC ( RNA-induced silencing complex) associates with a multiprotein complex containing MOV10 - which is the homologue of Drosophila translational repressor Armitage and proteins of the 60S ribosome subunit. Notably, this complex contains the anti-association factor eIF6 ( also called ITGB4BP or p27BBP), a ribosome inhibitory protein known to prevent productive assembly of the 80S ribosome. Depletion of eIF6 in human cells specifically abrogates miRNA-mediated regulation of target protein and mRNA levels. Similarly, depletion of eIF6 in Caenorhabditis elegans diminishes lin-4 miRNA-mediated repression of the endogenous LIN-14 and LIN-28 target protein and mRNA levels.

The detection of several precursor stars of type II supernovae has been reported ( see, for example, ref. 3), but we do not yet have direct information on the progenitors of the hydrogen-deficient type Ib and Ic supernovae. Here we report that the peculiar type Ib supernova SN 2006jc is spatially coincident with a bright optical transient(4) that occurred in 2004. Spectroscopic and photometric monitoring of the supernova leads us to suggest that the progenitor was a carbon-oxygen Wolf - Rayet star embedded within a helium-rich circumstellar medium. There are different possible explanations for this pre-explosion transient. It appears similar to the giant outbursts of luminous blue variable stars (LBVs) of 60 - 100 solar masses(5), but the progenitor of SN 2006jc was helium- and hydrogen-deficient ( unlike LBVs). An LBV-like outburst of a Wolf - Rayet star could be invoked, but this would be the first observational evidence of such a phenomenon. Alternatively, a massive binary system composed of an LBV that erupted in 2004, and a Wolf - Rayet star exploding as SN 2006jc, could explain the observations.","Queens Univ Belfast, Sch Math & Phys, Astrophys Res Ctr, Belfast BT7 1NN, Antrim, North Ireland; Itagaki Astron Observ, Teppo, Yamagata 9902492, Japan; Kyushu Univ, Dept Phys, Fukuoka 8108560, Japan; Osserv Astron Padova, INAF, I-35122 Padua, Italy; European So Observ, D-85748 Garching, Germany; Univ Ferrara, Dipartmento Fis, I-44100 Ferrara, Italy; Univ Padua, Dipartimento Astron, I-35122 Padua, Italy; Nord Opt Telescope, E-38700 Tenerife, Spain; Coddenham Astron Observ, Coddenham IP6 9QY, Suffolk, England; Ctr Etud Saclay, Serv Astrophys, DSM, DAPNIA,SAp, F-91191 Gif Sur Yvette, France; Univ Teramo, Dipartimento Sci Comunicaz, I-64100 Teramo, Italy; Chinese Acad Sci, Natl Astron Observ, Beijing 100012, Peoples R China; CNRS, IN2P3, Ctr Phys Particules Marseille, F-13288 Marseille 9, France; Univ Aix Marseille 2, F-13288 Marseille 9, France; CNRS, Inst Astrophys, F-75014 Paris, France; Univ Paris 06, F-75014 Paris, France; Univ La Laguna, E-38206 Tenerife, Spain; Osserv Astron Padova, INAF, I-36012 Vicenza, Italy; Telescopio Nazl Galileo, Fdn Galileo Galilei, INAF, E-38700 Tenerife, Spain; Max Planck Inst Astrophys, D-85741 Garching, Germany; Osserv Astron Trieste, INAF, I-34131 Trieste, Italy; Oriental Astron Assoc, CtrAstrodynam, Comp & Minor Planet Sect, Sumoto, Hyogo 6560011, Japan; Stockholm Univ, AlbaNova Univ Ctr, Dept Phys, SE-10691 Stockholm, Sweden","Pastorello, A (reprint author), Queens Univ Belfast, Sch Math & Phys, Astrophys Res Ctr, Belfast BT7 1NN, Antrim, North Ireland.",a.pastorello@qub.ac.uk,"Stanishev, Vallery/M-8930-2013; Elias-Rosa, Nancy/D-3759-2014; Valenti, Stefano/M-5924-2017","Stanishev, Vallery/0000-0002-7626-1181; Elias-Rosa, Nancy/0000-0002-1381-9125; Valenti, Stefano/0000-0001-8818-0795; Benetti, Stefano/0000-0002-3256-0016; Patat, Ferdinando/0000-0002-0537-3573; Zampieri, Luca/0000-0002-6516-1329; Lorenzi, Vania/0000-0002-1958-9930; Turatto, Massimo/0000-0002-9719-3157; Mazzali, Paolo/0000-0001-6876-8284",,,,29,178,178,1,17,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,14-Jun,2007,447,7146,,,,,829,832,,10.1038/nature05825,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,178FV,WOS:000247207500037,17568740,No,,,11/20/17

As a result, cold, dense plasma is believed to be flung outward from the inner magnetosphere by centrifugal force and replaced by hotter, more tenuous plasma from the outer magnetosphere. The centrifugal interchange(1) of plasmas in rotating magnetospheres was predicted many years ago(2-4) and was conclusively demonstrated by observations in Jupiter's magnetosphere(5-7), which - like that of Saturn ( but unlike that of Earth) - is rotationally dominated. Recent observations in Saturn's magnetosphere(8-10) have revealed narrow injections of hot, tenuous plasma believed to be the inward-moving portion of the centrifugal interchange cycle. Here we report observations of the distribution of the angle between the electron velocity vector and the magnetic field vector ('pitch angle') obtained in the cold, dense plasma adjacent to these inward injection regions. The observed pitch-angle distributions are indicative of outward plasma flow and consistent with centrifugal interchange in Saturn's magnetosphere. Further, we conclude that the observed double-peaked ('butterfly') pitch-angle distributions result from the transport of plasma from regions near the orbits of Dione and Tethys, supporting the idea of distinct plasma tori associated with these moons(11-13).","SW Res Inst, San Antonio, TX 78228 USA; UCL, Mullard Space Sci Lab, Dorking RH5 6NT, Surrey, England; Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Blackett Lab, London SW7 2BZ, England; European Space Agcy, Res & Sci Support Dept, NL-2200 AG Noordwijk, Netherlands","Lewis, WS (reprint author), SW Res Inst, PO Drawer 28510, San Antonio, TX 78228 USA.",wlewis@swri.edu,"Coates, Andrew/C-2396-2008","Coates, Andrew/0000-0002-6185-3125",Science and Technology Facilities Council [PP/D00084X/1],,,20,35,35,0,3,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,14-Jun,2007,447,7146,,,,,833,835,,10.1038/nature05906,,3,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,178FV,WOS:000247207500038,17568741,No,,,11/20/17

Superconducting qubits may offer an attractive route towards scalable quantum computing. In previous experiments on coupled superconducting qubits, conditional gate behaviour(2) and entanglement(3) were demonstrated. Here we demonstrate selective execution of the complete set of four different controlled-NOT ( CNOT) quantum logic gates, by applying microwave pulses of appropriate frequency to a single pair of coupled flux qubits. All two-qubit computational basis states and their superpositions are used as input, while two independent single-shot SQUID detectors measure the output state, including qubit - qubit correlations. We determined the gate's truth table by directly measuring the state transfer amplitudes and by acquiring the relevant quantum phase shift using a Ramsey-like interference experiment. The four conditional gates result from the symmetry of the qubits in the pair: either qubit can assume the role of control or target, and the gate action can be conditioned on either the 0-state or the 1-state. These gates are now sufficiently characterized to be used in quantum algorithms, and together form an efficient set of versatile building blocks.","Delft Univ Technol, Kavli Inst Nanosci, NL-2600 GA Delft, Netherlands","Plantenberg, JH (reprint author), Delft Univ Technol, Kavli Inst Nanosci, POB 5046, NL-2600 GA Delft, Netherlands.",j.h.plantenberg@tudelft.nl; j.e.mooij@tudelft.nl,"Mooij, Johan/B-1371-2012",,,,,18,227,232,1,21,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,14-Jun,2007,447,7146,,,,,836,839,,10.1038/nature05896,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,178FV,WOS:000247207500039,17568742,No,Y,N,11/20/17

Perhaps the most provocative evidence for an ancient ocean is a set of surface features that ring the plains for thousands of kilometres and that have been interpreted as a series of palaeoshorelines of different age(1,7). It has been shown, however, that topographic profiles along the putative shorelines contain long-wavelength trends with amplitudes of up to several kilometres(4,5,8), and these trends have been taken as an argument against the martian shoreline ( and ocean) hypothesis(8). Here we show that the long-wavelength topography of the shorelines is consistent with deformation caused by true polar wander - a change in the orientation of a planet with respect to its rotation pole - and that the inferred pole path has the geometry expected for a true polar wander event that postdates the formation of the massive Tharsis volcanic rise.","Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; Univ Toronto, Dept Phys, Toronto, ON M5S 1A7, Canada; Carnegie Inst Washington, Dept Terr Magnetism, Washington, DC 20015 USA","Perron, JT (reprint author), Harvard Univ, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, 20 Oxford St, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",perron@eps.harvard.edu,"Perron, J.

Although it has a body mass of about 1,400 kg, a phylogenetic analysis positions this new taxon within the Oviraptorosauria, a group of small, feathered theropods rarely exceeding 40 kg in body mass(2,4-7). A histological analysis suggests that Gigantoraptor gained this size by a growth rate considerably faster than large North American tyrannosaurs such as Albertosaurus and Gorgosaurus(8). Gigantoraptor possesses several salient features previously unknown in any other dinosaur and its hind limb bone scaling and proportions are significantly different from those of other coelurosaurs(9,10), thus increasing the morphological diversity among dinosaurs.

Although forest expansion following agricultural abandonment is certainly responsible for an important fraction of this carbon sink activity, the additional effects on the carbon balance of established forests of increased atmospheric carbon dioxide, increasing temperatures, changes in management practices and nitrogen deposition are difficult to disentangle, despite an extensive network of measurement stations(2,3). The relevance of this measurement effort has also been questioned(4), because spot measurements fail to take into account the role of disturbances, either natural ( fire, pests, windstorms) or anthropogenic ( forest harvesting). Here we show that the temporal dynamics following stand-replacing disturbances do indeed account for a very large fraction of the overall variability in forest carbon sequestration. After the confounding effects of disturbance have been factored out, however, forest net carbon sequestration is found to be overwhelmingly driven by nitrogen deposition, largely the result of anthropogenic activities(5). The effect is always positive over the range of nitrogen deposition covered by currently available data sets, casting doubts on the risk of widespread ecosystem nitrogen saturation(6) under natural conditions. The results demonstrate that mankind is ultimately controlling the carbon balance of temperate and boreal forests, either directly ( through forest management) or indirectly ( through nitrogen deposition).","Univ Bologna, Dept Fruit Tree & Woody Plant Sci, I-40127 Bologna, Italy; Univ Edinburgh, Sch Geosci, Edinburgh EH9 3JU, Midlothian, Scotland; Univ Basilicata, Dept Crop Syst Forestry & Environm Sci, I-85100 Potenza, Italy; INRA, UR1263 EPHYSE, F-33883 Villenave Dornon, France; Univ Quebec, Dept Sci Biol, Montreal, PQ H3C 3P8, Canada; Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Ecol & Environm Res, SE-75007 Uppsala, Sweden; Univ Helsinki, Dept Forest Ecol, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland; Lund Univ, Dept Forest Geog & Ecosyst Anal, S-22362 Lund, Sweden; Oregon State Univ, Coll Forestry, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA; Univ Tuscia, Dept Forest Resources & Environm, I-01100 Viterbo, Italy","Magnani, F (reprint author), Univ Bologna, Dept Fruit Tree & Woody Plant Sci, I-40127 Bologna, Italy.",federico.magnani@unibo.it,"; Kowalski, Andrew/A-7515-2008; Mencuccini, Maurizio/B-9052-2011; Berninger, Frank/A-8891-2010; Valentini, Riccardo/D-1226-2010; Borghetti, Marco/C-4262-2012; Grace, John/N-9280-2013; Lindroth, Anders/N-4697-2014; Rayment, Mark/L-9848-2016; Magnani, Federico/A-2448-2011; Law, Beverly/G-3882-2010","Kolari, Pasi/0000-0001-7271-633X; Kowalski, Andrew/0000-0001-9777-9708; Mencuccini, Maurizio/0000-0003-0840-1477; Valentini, Riccardo/0000-0002-6756-5634; Borghetti, Marco/0000-0003-3159-6655; Lindroth, Anders/0000-0002-7669-784X; Magnani, Federico/0000-0003-4479-0916; Law, Beverly/0000-0002-1605-1203; Berninger, Frank/0000-0001-7718-1661",,,,30,442,481,25,359,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,14-Jun,2007,447,7146,,,,,848,850,,10.1038/nature05847,,3,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,178FV,WOS:000247207500042,17568744,No,Y,N,11/20/17

Even during visual fixation, small eye movements continually jitter the location of gaze(1-4). It is known that visual percepts tend to fade when retinal image motion is eliminated in the laboratory(5-9). However, it has long been debated whether, during natural viewing, fixational eye movements have functions in addition to preventing the visual scene from fading(10-17). In this study, we analysed the influence in humans of fixational eye movements on the discrimination of gratings masked by noise that has a power spectrum similar to that of natural images. Using a new method of retinal image stabilization(18), we selectively eliminated the motion of the retinal image that normally occurs during the intersaccadic intervals of visual fixation. Here we show that fixational eye movements improve discrimination of high spatial frequency stimuli, but not of low spatial frequency stimuli. This improvement originates from the temporal modulations introduced by fixational eye movements in the visual input to the retina, which emphasize the high spatial frequency harmonics of the stimulus. In a natural visual world dominated by low spatial frequencies, fixational eye movements appear to constitute an effective sampling strategy by which the visual system enhances the processing of spatial detail.","Boston Univ, Dept Cognit & Neural Syst, Boston, MA 02215 USA","Rucci, M (reprint author), Boston Univ, Dept Cognit & Neural Syst, Boston, MA 02215 USA.",rucci@cns.bu.edu,,,,,,30,127,127,0,17,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,14-Jun,2007,447,7146,,,,,851,854,,10.1038/nature05866,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,178FV,WOS:000247207500043,17568745,No,,,11/20/17

Evolutionary pressure to enforce protective behaviour requires that damage-sensing neurons (nociceptors) continue to function at low temperatures. Here we show that this goal is achieved by endowing superficial endings of slowly conducting nociceptive fibres with the tetrodotoxin-resistant voltage-gated sodium channel (VGSC) Na(v)1.8 ( ref. 2). This channel is essential for sustained excitability of nociceptors when the skin is cooled. We show that cooling excitable membranes progressively enhances the voltage-dependent slow inactivation of tetrodotoxin-sensitive VGSCs. In contrast, the inactivation properties of Na(v)1.8 are entirely cold-resistant. Moreover, low temperatures decrease the activation threshold of the sodium currents and increase the membrane resistance, augmenting the voltage change caused by any membrane current. Thus, in the cold, Na(v)1.8 remains available as the sole electrical impulse generator in nociceptors that transmits nociceptive information to the central nervous system. Consistent with this concept is the observation that Na(v)1.8-null mutant mice(3) show negligible responses to noxious cold and mechanical stimulation at low temperatures. Our data present strong evidence for a specialized role of Na(v)1.8 in nociceptors as the critical molecule for the perception of cold pain and pain in the cold.","Univ Erlangen Nurnberg, Fac Med, Dept Physiol & Pathophysiol, D-91054 Erlangen, Germany; Univ Erlangen Nurnberg, Fac Med, Dept Anesthesiol, D-91054 Erlangen, Germany; Univ Bucharest, Fac Biol, Dept Anim Physiol & Biophys, Bucharest 050095, Romania; UCL, Dept Biol, London WC1E 6BT, England; Kyushu Univ, Fac Dent Sci, Dept Fixed Prosthodont, Higashi Ku, Fukuoka 8128582, Japan","Zimmermann, K (reprint author), Univ Erlangen Nurnberg, Fac Med, Dept Physiol & Pathophysiol, D-91054 Erlangen, Germany.",zimmermann@physiologie1.uni-erlangen.de,"Leffler, Andreas/C-6552-2009; Babes, Alexandru/A-6212-2010; Reeh, Peter/J-8981-2012; Leffler, Andreas/K-1191-2012","Reeh, Peter/0000-0002-4367-094X; Leffler, Andreas/0000-0003-1121-6387; Babes, Alexandru/0000-0002-7110-6908; Zimmermann, Katharina/0000-0003-2529-0692",Medical Research Council [G9717869]; Wellcome Trust,,,30,205,211,2,30,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,14-Jun,2007,447,7146,,,,,855,858,,10.1038/nature05880,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,178FV,WOS:000247207500044,17568746,No,,,11/20/17

When levels of misfolded protein overwhelm degradative pathways, the result is cellular toxicity and neurodegeneration(2). Cellular mechanisms for degrading misfolded protein include the ubiquitin-proteasome system ( UPS), the main non-lysosomal degradative pathway for ubiquitinated proteins, and autophagy, a lysosome-mediated degradative pathway(3). The UPS and autophagy have long been viewed as complementary degradation systems with no point of intersection(4,5). This view has been challenged by two observations suggesting an apparent interaction: impairment of the UPS induces autophagy in vitro, and conditional knockout of autophagy in the mouse brain leads to neurodegeneration with ubiquitin-positive pathology(6-9). It is not known whether autophagy is strictly a parallel degradation system, or whether it is a compensatory degradation system when the UPS is impaired; furthermore, if there is a compensatory interaction between these systems, the molecular link is not known. Here we show that autophagy acts as a compensatory degradation system when the UPS is impaired in Drosophila melanogaster, and that histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6), a microtubule-associated deacetylase that interacts with polyubiquitinated proteins(10), is an essential mechanistic link in this compensatory interaction. We found that compensatory autophagy was induced in response to mutations affecting the proteasome and in response to UPS impairment in a fly model of the neurodegenerative disease spinobulbar muscular atrophy. Autophagy compensated for impaired UPS function in an HDAC6-dependent manner. Furthermore, expression of HDAC6 was sufficient to rescue degeneration associated with UPS dysfunction in vivo in an autophagy-dependent manner. This study suggests that impairment of autophagy ( for example, associated with ageing or genetic variation) might predispose to neurodegeneration. Morover, these findings suggest that it may be possible to intervene in neurodegeneration by augmenting HDAC6 to enhance autophagy.","Univ Penn, Sch Med, Dept Neurol, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; Univ Maryland, Inst Biotechnol, Ctr Biosyst Res, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; NINDS, Neurogenet Branch, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20817 USA; Stanford Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; Novartis Inst Biomed Res, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; Duke Univ, Dept Pharmacol & Canc Biol, Durham, NC 27710 USA","Taylor, JP (reprint author), Univ Penn, Sch Med, Dept Neurol, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",jpt@mail.med.upenn.edu,"Schuldiner, Oren/K-1353-2012","Schuldiner, Oren/0000-0002-7350-9380","NINDS NIH HHS [R01 NS054022, R01 NS054022-02]",,,25,694,710,8,72,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,14-Jun,2007,447,7146,,,,,859,863,,10.1038/nature05853,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,178FV,WOS:000247207500045,17568747,No,Y,N,11/20/17

Small molecules with oncogene-selective lethality may reveal novel functions of oncoproteins and enable the creation of more selective drugs(1). Here we describe the mechanism of action of the selective anti-tumour agent erastin, involving the RAS - RAF - MEK signalling pathway functioning in cell proliferation, differentiation and survival. Erastin exhibits greater lethality in human tumour cells harbouring mutations in the oncogenes HRAS, KRAS or BRAF. Using affinity purification and mass spectrometry, we discovered that erastin acts through mitochondrial voltage-dependent anion channels (VDACs) - a novel target for anti-cancer drugs. We show that erastin treatment of cells harbouring oncogenic RAS causes the appearance of oxidative species and subsequent death through an oxidative, non-apoptotic mechanism. RNA-interference-mediated knockdown of VDAC2 or VDAC3 caused resistance to erastin, implicating these two VDAC isoforms in the mechanism of action of erastin. Moreover, using purified mitochondria expressing a single VDAC isoform, we found that erastin alters the permeability of the outer mitochondrial membrane. Finally, using a radiolabelled analogue and a filter-binding assay, we show that erastin binds directly to VDAC2. These results demonstrate that ligands to VDAC proteins can induce non-apoptotic cell death selectively in some tumour cells harbouring activating mutations in the RAS - RAF - MEK pathway.","Columbia Univ, Fairchild Ctr, Dept Biol Sci, New York, NY 10027 USA; Columbia Univ, Dept Chem, New York, NY 10027 USA; Prolexys Pharmaceut, Salt Lake City, UT 84116 USA; Huntsman Canc Inst, Ctr Children, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA","Stockwell, BR (reprint author), Columbia Univ, Fairchild Ctr, Dept Biol Sci, 1212 Amsterdam Ave,MC 2406, New York, NY 10027 USA.",stockwell@biology.columbia.edu,,"Wolpaw, Adam/0000-0002-1373-7648","NCI NIH HHS [R01 CA097061, R01 CA097061-01, R01 CA097061-02, R01 CA097061-03, R01 CA097061-04, R01 CA097061-05A1, R01 CA097061-06, R01 CA097061-07, R01 CA097061-08, R01 CA097061-08S1, R01 CA097061-09, R01 CA097061-09S1]",,,24,210,216,2,28,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,14-Jun,2007,447,7146,,,,,864,868,,10.1038/nature05859,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,178FV,WOS:000247207500046,17568748,No,,,11/20/17

During resolution, specific omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty-acid-derived mediators are generated within resolving exudates, including resolvin E1 (RvE1)(4) and protectin D1 (PD1)(5). It is thus important to pinpoint specific actions of RvE1 and PD1 in regulating tissue resolution. Here we report that RvE1 and PD1 in nanogram quantities promote phagocyte removal during acute inflammation by regulating leukocyte infiltration, increasing macrophage ingestion of apoptotic polymorphonuclear neutrophils in vivo and in vitro, and enhancing the appearance of phagocytes carrying engulfed zymosan in lymph nodes and spleen. In this tissue terrain, inhibition of either cyclooxygenase or lipoxygenases - pivotal enzymes in the temporal generation of both pro-inflammatory and pro-resolving mediators - caused a 'resolution deficit' that was rescued by RvE1, PD1 or aspirin-triggered lipoxin A(4) analogue. Also, new resolution routes were identified that involve phagocytes traversing perinodal adipose tissues and non-apoptotic polymorphonuclear neutrophils carrying engulfed zymosan to lymph nodes. Together, these results identify new active components for postexudate resolution traffic, and demonstrate that RvE1 and PD1 are potent agonists for resolution of inflamed tissues.","Brigham & Womens Hosp, Ctr Expt Therapeut & Reperfus Injury, Dept Anesthesiol Perioperat & Pain Med, Boston, MA 02115 USA; Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Boston, MA 02115 USA","Serhan, CN (reprint author), Brigham & Womens Hosp, Ctr Expt Therapeut & Reperfus Injury, Dept Anesthesiol Perioperat & Pain Med, 75 Francis St, Boston, MA 02115 USA.",cnserhan@zeus.bwh.harvard.edu,,,"NIDCR NIH HHS [P50 DE016191-03, P50 DE016191]; NIDDK NIH HHS [R01 DK074448, R01 DK074448-02]; NIGMS NIH HHS [R01 GM038765, R37 GM038765, R37 GM038765-20]",,,29,585,609,5,71,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,14-Jun,2007,447,7146,,,,,869,874,,10.1038/nature05877,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,178FV,WOS:000247207500047,17568749,No,Y,N,11/20/17

An mRNA bearing an ApppG instead of anm(7) GpppG cap structure escapes the miR2-mediated translational block.

Here we address this question by taking advantage of the highly specific role of DNA ligase IV in the repair of DNA double-strand breaks by non-homologous end-joining, and by the discovery of a unique mouse strain with a hypomorphic Lig4(Y288C) mutation. The Lig4(Y288C) mouse, identified by means of a mutagenesis screening programme, is a mouse model for human LIG4 syndrome, showing immunodeficiency and growth retardation. Diminished DNA double-strand break repair in the Lig4(Y288C) strain causes a progressive loss of haematopoietic stem cells and bone marrow cellularity during ageing, and severely impairs stem cell function in tissue culture and transplantation. The sensitivity of haematopoietic stem cells to non-homologous end-joining deficiency is therefore a key determinant of their ability to maintain themselves against physiological stress over time and to withstand culture and transplantation.","Univ Sussex, Genome Damage & Stabil Ctr, Brighton BN1 9RQ, E Sussex, England; Univ Oxford, Oxford OX3 9DU, England; Int Ctr Genet Engn & Biotechnol, I-34012 Trieste, Italy; Australian Natl Univ, Australia & Australian Phenom Facil, Australian Canc Res Fdn Genet Lab, John Curtin Sch Med Res, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia; Univ Oxford, Weatherall Inst Mol Med, Oxford OX3 9DS, England; Brunel Univ, Brunel Inst Canc Genet & Pharmacogenom, Uxbridge UB8 3PH, Middx, England","Jeggo, PA (reprint author), Univ Sussex, Genome Damage & Stabil Ctr, Brighton BN1 9RQ, E Sussex, England.",p.a.jeggo@sussex.ac.uk; richard.cornall@ndm.ox.ac.uk,"Lambe, Teresa/E-5733-2016","Lambe, Teresa/0000-0001-7711-897X","Medical Research Council [G0500897, MC_U137884178, MC_U137973817]; Wellcome Trust",,,42,329,341,1,21,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,7-Jun,2007,447,7145,,,,,686,U9,,10.1038/nature05875,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,175RI,WOS:000247030700037,17554302,No,,,11/20/17

This fortuitous geometry allows direct determination of many planetary properties(1). Previous reports of planetary thermal emission(2-5) give fluxes that are roughly consistent with predictions based on thermal equilibrium with the planets' received radiation, assuming a Bond albedo of similar to 0.3. Here we report direct detection of thermal emission from the smallest known transiting planet, HD149026b, that indicates a brightness temperature ( an expression of flux) of 2,300 +/- 6200K at 8 mm. The planet's predicted temperature for uniform, spherical, blackbody emission and zero albedo ( unprecedented for planets) is 1,741 K. As models with non-zero albedo are cooler, this essentially eliminates uniform blackbody models, and may also require an albedo lower than any measured for a planet, very strong 8 mm emission, strong temporal variability, or a heat source other than stellar radiation. On the other hand, an instantaneous re-emission blackbody model, in which each patch of surface area instantly re-emits all received light, matches the data. This planet is known(6-9) to be enriched in heavy elements, which may give rise to novel atmospheric properties yet to be investigated.","Univ Cent Florida, Dept Phys, Orlando, FL 32816 USA; Cornell Univ, Ctr Radiophys & Space Res, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Astron, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; MIT, Dept Earth Atmospher & Planetary Sci, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; MIT, Dept Phys, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; NASA, Goddard Space Flight Ctr, Planetary Syst Lab, Greenbelt, MD 20771 USA; NASA, Goddard Space Flight Ctr, Exoplanet & Stellar Astrophys Lab, Greenbelt, MD 20771 USA","Harrington, J (reprint author), Univ Cent Florida, Dept Phys, Orlando, FL 32816 USA.",jharring@physics.ucf.edu,"Harrington, Joseph/E-6250-2011","Harrington, Joseph/0000-0002-8955-8531",,,,27,110,110,0,5,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,7-Jun,2007,447,7145,,,,,691,693,,10.1038/nature05863,,3,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,175RI,WOS:000247030700038,17495928,No,,,11/20/17

However, its intrinsically low sensitivity precludes NMR analysis of very small samples - as frequently used when studying isotopically labelled biological molecules or advanced materials, or as preferred when conducting high-throughput screening of biological samples or 'lab-on-a-chip' studies. The sensitivity of NMR has been improved by using static micro-coils(1), alternative detection schemes(2,3) and pre-polarization approaches(4). But these strategies cannot be easily used in NMR experiments involving the fast sample spinning essential for obtaining well-resolved spectra(5,6) from non-liquid samples. Here we demonstrate that inductive coupling allows wireless transmission of radio-frequency pulses and the reception of NMR signals under fast spinning of both detector coil and sample. This enables NMR measurements characterized by an optimal filling factor, very high radio-frequency field amplitudes and enhanced sensitivity that increases with decreasing sample volume. Signals obtained for nanolitre-sized samples of organic powders and biological tissue increase by almost one order of magnitude ( or, equivalently, are acquired two orders of magnitude faster), compared to standard NMR measurements. Our approach also offers optimal sensitivity when studying samples that need to be confined inside multiple safety barriers, such as radioactive materials. In principle, the co-rotation of a micrometre-sized detector coil with the sample and the use of inductive coupling ( techniques that are at the heart of our method) should enable highly sensitive NMR measurements on any mass-limited sample that requires fast mechanical rotation to obtain well-resolved spectra. The method is easy to implement on a commercial NMR set-up and exhibits improved performance with miniaturization, and we accordingly expect that it will facilitate the development of novel solid-state NMR methodologies and find wide use in high-throughput chemical and biomedical analysis.","CEA Saclay, Lab Struct & Dynam Resonance Magnet, Serv Chim Mol, CNRS,DSM DRECAM SCM,URA 331, F-91191 Gif Sur Yvette, France; CEA Saclay, Serv Phys Etat Condense, DSM DRECAM SPEC, CNRS,URA 2464, F-91191 Gif Sur Yvette, France","Sakellariou, D (reprint author), CEA Saclay, Lab Struct & Dynam Resonance Magnet, Serv Chim Mol, CNRS,DSM DRECAM SCM,URA 331, F-91191 Gif Sur Yvette, France.",dimitrios.sakellariou@cea.fr,"Sakellariou, Dimitrios/F-2846-2010","Sakellariou, Dimitrios/0000-0001-7424-5543",,,,30,105,106,1,45,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,7-Jun,2007,447,7145,,,,,694,+,,10.1038/nature05897,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,175RI,WOS:000247030700039,17554303,No,,,11/20/17

This trend has been attributed to both anthropogenically induced climate change(3) and natural variability(1), but the primary cause remains uncertain. Changes in the frequency and intensity of hurricanes in the past can provide insights into the factors that influence hurricane activity, but reliable observations of hurricane activity in the North Atlantic only cover the past few decades(2). Here we construct a record of the frequency of major Atlantic hurricanes over the past 270 years using proxy records of vertical wind shear and sea surface temperature ( the main controls on the formation of major hurricanes kin this region(1,3-5)) from corals and a marine sediment core. The record indicates that the average frequency of major hurricanes decreased gradually from the 1760s until the early 1990s, reaching anomalously low values during the 1970s and 1980s. Furthermore, the phase of enhanced hurricane activity since 1995 is not unusual compared to other periods of high hurricane activity in the record and thus appears to represent a recovery to normal hurricane activity, rather than a direct response to increasing sea surface temperature. Comparison of the record with a reconstruction of vertical wind shear indicates that variability in this parameter primarily controlled the frequency of major hurricanes in the Atlantic over the past 270 years, suggesting that changes in the magnitude of vertical wind shear will have a significant influence on future hurricane activity.","Geol Survey Sweden, SE-75128 Uppsala, Sweden; Univ Gothenburg, Dept Earth Sci, SE-40530 Gothenburg, Sweden; Univ Puerto Rico, Dept Phys, Mayaguez, PR 00681 USA; Univ S Florida, Coll Marine Sci, St Petersburg, FL 33707 USA; NOAA, Earth Syst Res Lab, Phys Sci Div R PSD1, Boulder, CO 80305 USA; Univ Texas, Dept Geol Sci, Jackson Sch Geosci, Austin, TX 78712 USA; Univ Texas, Inst Geophys, Austin, TX 78758 USA","Nyberg, J (reprint author), Geol Survey Sweden, Box 670, SE-75128 Uppsala, Sweden.",johan.nyberg@sgu.se,"Quinn, Terrence/A-5755-2008; Kilbourne, Kelly /D-6560-2012","Kilbourne, Kelly /0000-0001-7864-8438",,,,33,85,87,1,49,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,7-Jun,2007,447,7145,,,,,698,U11,,10.1038/nature05895,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,175RI,WOS:000247030700040,17554304,No,,,11/20/17

Radiogenic isotope evidence for such recycling remains equivocal because the age and location of parent-daughter fractionation are not known. Conversely, while stable isotopes can provide irrefutable evidence for low-temperature fractionation, their range in most unaltered oceanic basalts is limited and the age of any variation is unconstrained. Here we show that delta(18)O ratios in basalts from the Azores are often lower than in pristine mantle. This, combined with increased Nb/B ratios and a large range in delta(11)B ratios, provides compelling evidence for the recycling of materials that had undergone fractionation near the Earth's surface. Moreover, delta(11)B is negatively correlated with (187)Os/(188)Os ratios, which extend to subchondritic values(1), constraining the age of the high Nb/B, (11)B-enriched endmember to be more than 2.5 billion years ( Gyr) old. We infer this component to be melt- and fluid-depleted lithospheric mantle from a subducted oceanic plate, whereas other Azores basalts contain a contribution from similar to 3-Gyr-old melt-enriched basalt(2). We conclude that both components are most probably derived from an Archaean oceanic plate that was subducted, arguably into the deep mantle, where it was stored until thermal buoyancy caused it to rise beneath the Azores islands 3 Gyr later.","Macquarie Univ, GEMOC, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, N Ryde, NSW 2109, Australia; Ist Geosci & Georisorse, I-56147 Pisa, Italy; Univ Wisconsin, Dept Geol & Geophys, Madison, WI 53706 USA; Natl Sci Fdn, Arlington, VA 22230 USA; Monash Univ, Sch Geosci, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia","Turner, S (reprint author), Macquarie Univ, GEMOC, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, N Ryde, NSW 2109, Australia.",sturner@els.mq.edu.au,"Bindeman, Ilya/D-2497-2012; GAU, geochemist/H-1985-2016","Bindeman, Ilya/0000-0003-2778-9083; ",,,,30,37,37,1,27,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,7-Jun,2007,447,7145,,,,,702,705,,10.1038/nature05898,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,175RI,WOS:000247030700041,17554305,No,,,11/20/17

However, the identification of the trends themselves and the underlying processes that may produce them have often been controversial(1). In 1862, in explaining the exceptionally long nectar spur of Angraecum sesquipedale, Darwin proposed that a coevolutionary 'race' had driven the directional increase in length of a plant's spur and its pollinator's tongue(2). Thus he predicted the existence of an exceptionally long-tongued moth. Though the discovery of Xanthopan morgani ssp. praedicta in 1903 with a tongue length of 22 cm validated Darwin's prediction(3), his 'race' model for the evolution of long-spurred flowers remains contentious(4). Spurs may also evolve to exceptional lengths by way of pollinator shifts as plants adapt to a series of unrelated pollinators, each with a greater tongue length(5). Here, using a species-level phylogeny of the columbine genus, Aquilegia, we show a significant evolutionary trend for increasing spur length during directional shifts to pollinators with longer tongues. In addition, we find evidence for 'punctuated' change in spur length during speciation events(6), suggesting that Aquilegia nectar spurs rapidly evolve to fit adaptive peaks predefined by pollinator morphology. These findings show that evolution may proceed in predictable pathways without reversals and that change may be concentrated during speciation.","Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Ecol Evolut & Marine Biol, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA","Whittall, JB (reprint author), Univ Calif Davis, Sect Evolut & Ecol, 1 Shields Ave, Davis, CA 95616 USA.",jbwhittall@ucdavis.edu; hodges@lifesci.ucsb.edu,,,,,,29,279,292,23,302,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,7-Jun,2007,447,7145,,,,,706,U12,,10.1038/nature05857,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,175RI,WOS:000247030700042,17554306,No,Y,N,11/20/17

We demonstrate significant changes in population trajectories for seven species from four families that concur with a priori predictions and the spatio-temporal intensity of pathogen transmission.

Here we report a high-quality draft genome sequence of a small egg-laying freshwater teleost, medaka ( Oryzias latipes). Medaka is native to East Asia and an excellent model system for a wide range of biology, including ecotoxicology, carcinogenesis, sex determination(4-6) and developmental genetics(7). In the assembled medaka genome ( 700 megabases), which is less than half of the zebrafish genome, we predicted 20,141 genes, including 2,900 new genes, using 5'-end serial analysis of gene expression tag information. We found single nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs) at an average rate of 3.42% between the two inbred strains derived from two regional populations; this is the highest SNP rate seen in any vertebrate species. Analyses based on the dense SNP information show a strict genetic separation of 4 million years ( Myr) between the two populations, and suggest that differential selective pressures acted on specific gene categories. Four-way comparisons with the human, pufferfish ( Tetraodon), zebrafish and medaka genomes revealed that eight major interchromosomal rearrangements took place in a remarkably short period of similar to 50 Myr after the whole-genome duplication event in the teleost ancestor and afterwards, intriguingly, the medaka genome preserved its ancestral karyotype for more than 300 Myr.","Univ Tokyo, Dept Computat Biol, Grad Sch Frontier Sci, Kashiwa, Chiba 2770882, Japan; Univ Tokyo, Dept Biol Sci, Grad Sch Sci, Tokyo 1130033, Japan; RIKEN, Genom Sci Ctr, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2300045, Japan; Natl Inst Informat, Tokyo 1018430, Japan; Keio Univ, Sch Med, Dept Mol Biol, Tokyo 1608582, Japan; Univ Tokyo, Dept Mol Prevent Med, Sch Med, Tokyo 1130033, Japan; Univ Tokyo, Dept Med Genome Sci, Grad Sch Frontier Sci, Tokyo 1088639, Japan; Niigata Univ, Dept Environm Sci, Fac Sci, Niigata 9502181, Japan; Natl Inst Genet, Ctr Genet Resource Informat, Mishima, Shizuoka 4118540, Japan","Kohara, Y (reprint author), Univ Tokyo, Dept Computat Biol, Grad Sch Frontier Sci, Kashiwa, Chiba 2770882, Japan.",htakeda@biol.s.u-tokyo.ac.jp; ykohara@lab.nig.ac.jp,"Narita, Takanori/F-1092-2011; TAKEDA, HIROYUKI/G-4950-2014","Naruse, Kiyoshi/0000-0001-9185-3495",,,,30,568,585,5,79,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,7-Jun,2007,447,7145,,,,,714,719,,10.1038/nature05846,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,175RI,WOS:000247030700044,17554307,No,Y,N,11/20/17

Cells within each column are arranged in a stereotyped fashion and form precise patterns of synaptic connections within discrete layers. These connections are largely confined to a single column, thereby preserving the spatial information from the periphery. Other neurons integrate this information by connecting to multiple columns. Restricting axons to columns is conceptually similar to tiling. Axons and dendrites of neighbouring neurons of the same class use tiling to form complete, yet non-overlapping, receptive fields(1-3). It is thought that, at the molecular level, cell-surface proteins mediate tiling through contact-dependent repulsive interactions(1,2,4,5), but proteins serving this function have not yet been identified. Here we show that the immunoglobulin superfamily member Dscam2 restricts the connections formed by L1 lamina neurons to columns in the Drosophila visual system. Our data support a model in which Dscam2 homophilic interactions mediate repulsion between neurites of L1 cells in neighbouring columns.

Here we show that although deficiencies in these pathways did not deplete stem cell reserves with age, stem cell functional capacity was severely affected under conditions of stress, leading to loss of reconstitution and proliferative potential, diminished self-renewal, increased apoptosis and, ultimately, functional exhaustion. Moreover, we provide evidence that endogenous DNA damage accumulates with age in wild-type stem cells. These data are consistent with DNA damage accrual being a physiological mechanism of stem cell ageing that may contribute to the diminished capacity of aged tissues to return to homeostasis after exposure to acute stress or injury.","Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Dept Pathol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Inst Stem Cell Biol & Regenerat Med, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; NCI, Expt Immunol Branch, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; NCI, Lab Receptor Biol, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; Erasmus MC, MGC CBG Dept Cell Biol & Genet, NL-3000 DR Rotterdam, Netherlands","Rossi, DJ (reprint author), Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Dept Pathol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",drossi@stanford.edu,,"Seita, Jun/0000-0002-3008-3615",,,,35,570,587,7,35,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,7-Jun,2007,447,7145,,,,,725,U15,,10.1038/nature05862,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,175RI,WOS:000247030700046,17554309,No,Y,N,11/20/17

Cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers and photoproducts generated by ultraviolet irradiation cause stalling of RNA polymerase II, activation of transcription-coupled repair enzymes, and inhibition of RNA synthesis(1,2). During the S phase of the cell cycle, collision of replication forks with damaged DNA blocks ongoing DNA replication while also triggering a biochemical signal that suppresses the firing of distant origins of replication(3,4). Whether the transcription machinery is affected by the presence of DNA double-strand breaks remains a long-standing question. Here we monitor RNA polymerase I ( Pol I) activity in mouse cells exposed to genotoxic stress and show that induction of DNA breaks leads to a transient repression in Pol I transcription. Surprisingly, we find Pol I inhibition is not itself the direct result of DNA damage but is mediated by ATM kinase activity and the repair factor proteins NBS1 ( also known as NLRP2) and MDC1. Using live-cell imaging, laser micro-irradiation, and photobleaching technology we demonstrate that DNA lesions interfere with Pol I initiation complex assembly and lead to a premature displacement of elongating holoenzymes from ribosomal DNA.

Short interfering RNAs ( siRNAs) can direct DNA methylation and heterochromatic histone modifications, causing sequence-specific transcriptional gene silencing(1,4,8,9). In animals and yeast, histone H2B is known to be monoubiquitinated, and this regulates the methylation of histone H3 ( refs 10, 11). However, the relationship between histone ubiquitination and DNA methylation has not been investigated. Here we show that mutations in an Arabidopsis deubiquitination enzyme, SUP32/UBP26, decrease the dimethylation on lysine 9 of H3, suppress siRNA-directed methylation of DNA and release heterochromatic silencing of transgenes as well as transposons. We found that Arabidopsis histone H2B is monoubiquitinated at lysine 143 and that the levels of ubiquitinated H2B and trimethyl H3 at lysine 4 increase in sup32 mutant plants. SUP32/UBP26 can deubiquitinate H2B, and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays suggest an association between H2B ubiquitination and release of silencing. These data suggest that H2B deubiquitination by SUP32/UBP26 is required for heterochromatic histone H3 methylation and DNA methylation.","Univ Calif Riverside, Ctr Plant Cell Biol, Riverside, CA 92521 USA; Univ Calif Riverside, Dept Bot & Plant Sci, Riverside, CA 92521 USA; Univ Calif Riverside, Mass Spectrometry Facil, Dept Chem, Riverside, CA 92521 USA; Purdue Univ, Dept Hort & Landscape Architecture, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA","Zhu, JK (reprint author), Univ Calif Riverside, Ctr Plant Cell Biol, Riverside, CA 92521 USA.",jian-kang.zhu@ucr.edu,"Zhu, Jian-Kang/F-7658-2011","Zhu, Jian-Kang/0000-0001-5134-731X",,,,28,135,167,1,30,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,7-Jun,2007,447,7145,,,,,735,U18,,10.1038/nature05864,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,175RI,WOS:000247030700048,17554311,No,,,11/20/17

Dietary restriction activates skn-1 in these two neurons, which signals peripheral tissues to increase metabolic activity. These findings demonstrate that increased lifespan in a diet-restricted metazoan depends on cell non-autonomous signalling from central neuronal cells to non-neuronal body tissues, and suggest that the ASI neurons mediate diet-restriction-induced longevity by an endocrine mechanism.","MIT, Dept Biol, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA","Guarente, L (reprint author), MIT, Dept Biol, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",leng@mit.edu,,,,,,37,367,388,6,50,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,31-May,2007,447,7144,,,,,545,+,,10.1038/nature05904,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,172YZ,WOS:000246842000038,17538612,No,,,11/20/17

Dietary restriction elicits a genetically programmed response to nutrient availability that cannot be explained by a simple reduction in metabolism or slower growth of the organism. In the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans, the transcription factor PHA-4 has an essential role in the embryonic development of the foregut and is orthologous to genes encoding the mammalian family of Foxa transcription factors, Foxa1, Foxa2 and Foxa3. Foxa family members have important roles during development, but also act later in life to regulate glucagon production and glucose homeostasis, particularly in response to fasting. Here we describe a newly discovered, adult-specific function for PHA-4 in the regulation of diet-restriction-mediated longevity in C. elegans. The role of PHA-4 in lifespan determination is specific for dietary restriction, because it is not required for the increased longevity caused by other genetic pathways that regulate ageing.","Salk Inst Biol Studies, Mol & Cell Biol Lab, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA","Dillin, A (reprint author), Salk Inst Biol Studies, Mol & Cell Biol Lab, 10010 N Torrey Pines Rd, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA.",dillin@salk.edu,,,,,,50,324,360,1,47,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,31-May,2007,447,7144,,,,,550,+,,10.1038/nature05837,,7,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,172YZ,WOS:000246842000039,17476212,No,,,11/20/17

We exploit surface-bound peptides to overcome complexities of investigating such problems in solution. For the yeast prion Sup35, we find that the switch to the prion state is controlled with exquisite specificity by small elements of primary sequence. Strikingly, these same sequence elements govern the formation of distinct self-perpetuating conformations ( prion strains) and determine species-specific seeding activities. A Sup35 chimaera that traverses the transmission barrier between two yeast species possesses the critical sequence elements from both. Using this chimaera, we show that the influence of environment and mutations on the formation of species-specific strains is driven by selective recognition of either sequence element. Thus, critical aspects of prion conversion are enciphered by subtle differences between small, highly specific recognition elements.","Whitehead Inst Biomed Res, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA","Lindquist, S (reprint author), Whitehead Inst Biomed Res, Howard Hughes Med Inst, 9 Cambridge Ctr, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA.",lindquist_admin@wi.mit.edu,,"Tessier, Peter/0000-0002-3220-007X","NIGMS NIH HHS [R37 GM025874, R37 GM025874-27, R01 GM025874]",,,51,103,104,0,13,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,31-May,2007,447,7144,,,,,556,+,,10.1038/nature05848,,7,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,172YZ,WOS:000246842000040,17495929,No,,,11/20/17

Although the inner regions of protoplanetary disks in nearby star-forming regions subtend only a few nano-radians, near-infrared interferometry has recently enabled the spatial resolution of these terrestrial zones. Most observations have probed only dust(6), which typically dominates the near-infrared emission. Here I report spectrally dispersed near-infrared interferometric observations that probe the gas (which dominates the mass and dynamics of the inner disk), in addition to the dust, within one astronomical unit (1 AU, the Sun Earth distance) of the young star MWC480. I resolve gas, including water vapour and atomic hydrogen, interior to the edge of the dust disk; this contrasts with results of previous spectrally dispersed interferometry observations(7,8). Interactions of this accreting gas with migrating planets may lead to short-period exoplanets like those detected around main-sequence stars(4). The observed water vapour is probably produced by the sublimation of migrating icy bodies(9), and provides a potential reservoir of water for terrestrial planets(10).","Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Astron, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA","Eisner, JA (reprint author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Astron, 601 Campbell Hall, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",jae@astro.berkeley.edu,,,,,,30,38,38,0,5,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,31-May,2007,447,7144,,,,,562,564,,10.1038/nature05867,,3,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,172YZ,WOS:000246842000041,17538613,No,,,11/20/17

A central issue is the origin of the differences in the physical properties of these copper oxides doped to opposite sides of the superconducting region. In the overdoped regime, the material behaves as a reasonably conventional metal, with a large Fermi surface(3,4). The underdoped regime, however, is highly anomalous and appears to have no coherent Fermi surface, but only disconnected 'Fermi arcs'(5,6). The fundamental question, then, is whether underdoped copper oxides have a Fermi surface, and if so, whether it is topologically different from that seen in the overdoped regime. Here we report the observation of quantum oscillations in the electrical resistance of the oxygen-ordered copper oxide YBa2Cu3O6.5, establishing the existence of a well-defined Fermi surface in the ground state of underdoped copper oxides, once superconductivity is suppressed by a magnetic field. The low oscillation frequency reveals a Fermi surface made of small pockets, in contrast to the large cylinder characteristic of the overdoped regime. Two possible interpretations are discussed: either a small pocket is part of the band structure specific to YBa2Cu3O6.5 or small pockets arise from a topological change at a critical point in the phase diagram. Our understanding of high-transition-temperature (high-T-c) superconductors will depend critically on which of these two interpretations proves to be correct.","UPS, INSA 5147, UMR CNRS, Lab Natl Champs Magnet, F-31400 Toulouse, France; Univ Sherbrooke, Dept Phys, Sherbrooke, PQ J1K 2R1, Canada; Univ Sherbrooke, RQMP, Sherbrooke, PQ J1K 2R1, Canada; Univ British Columbia, Dept Phys & Astron, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada; Canadian Inst Adv Res, Toronto, ON M5G 1Z8, Canada","Proust, C (reprint author), UPS, INSA 5147, UMR CNRS, Lab Natl Champs Magnet, F-31400 Toulouse, France.",proust@lncmp.org; louis.taillefer@physique.usherbrooke.ca,,,,,,30,622,627,9,121,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,31-May,2007,447,7144,,,,,565,568,,10.1038/nature05872,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,172YZ,WOS:000246842000042,17538614,No,Y,N,11/20/17

In the high-T-c superconductors, a partial gap in the DOS exists for a range of temperatures above T-c (ref. 2). A key question is whether the gap in the DOS above T-c is associated with pairing, and what determines the temperature at which incoherent pairs form. Here we report the first spatially resolved measurements of gap formation in a high-T-c superconductor, measured on Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+delta samples with different T-c values ( hole concentration of 0.12 to 0.22) using scanning tunnelling microscopy. Over a wide range of doping from 0.16 to 0.22 we find that pairing gaps nucleate in nanoscale regions above T-c. These regions proliferate as the temperature is lowered, resulting in a spatial distribution of gap sizes in the superconducting state(3-5). Despite the inhomogeneity, we find that every pairing gap develops locally at a temperature T-p, following the relation 2 Delta/k(B)T(p) = 7.9 +/- 0.5. At very low doping (<= 0.14), systematic changes in the DOS indicate the presence of another phenomenon(6-9), which is unrelated and perhaps competes with electron pairing. Our observation of nanometre-sized pairing regions provides the missing microscopic basis for understanding recent reports(10-13) of fluctuating superconducting response above T-c in hole-doped high-T-c copper oxide superconductors.","Cent Res Inst Elect Power Ind, Tokyo 2018511, Japan; Princeton Univ, Joseph Henry Labs, Dept Phys, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA","Yazdani, A (reprint author), Princeton Univ, Joseph Henry Labs, Dept Phys, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA.",yazdani@princeton.edu,"Pushp, Aakash/G-6626-2011; Ando, Yoichi/B-8163-2013","Ando, Yoichi/0000-0002-3553-3355",,,,28,304,306,3,63,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,31-May,2007,447,7144,,,,,569,572,,10.1038/nature05881,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,172YZ,WOS:000246842000043,17538615,No,Y,N,11/20/17

Yet no viable means of developing spintronics in semiconductors has been presented. Here we report a theoretical design that is a conceptual step forward-spin accumulation is used as the basis of a semiconductor computer circuit. Although the giant magnetoresistance effect in metals(11,12) has already been commercially exploited, it does not extend to semiconductor/ ferromagnet systems, because the effect is too weak for logic operations. We overcome this obstacle by using spin accumulation rather than spin flow(13-15). The basic element in our design is a logic gate that consists of a semiconductor structure with multiple magnetic contacts; this serves to perform fast and reprogrammable logic operations in a noisy, room-temperature environment. We then introduce a method to interconnect a large number of these gates to form a 'spin computer'. As the shrinking of conventional complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) transistors reaches its intrinsic limit, greater computational capability will mean an increase in both circuit area and power dissipation. Our spin-based approach may provide wide margins for further scaling and also greater computational capability per gate.","Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Phys, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA","Dery, H (reprint author), Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Phys, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.",hdery@ucsd.edu,"Cywinski, Lukasz/E-5348-2010","Cywinski, Lukasz/0000-0002-0162-7943; Sham, Lu/0000-0001-5718-2077",,,,30,194,194,3,55,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,31-May,2007,447,7144,,,,,573,576,,10.1038/nature05833,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,172YZ,WOS:000246842000044,17538616,No,,,11/20/17

Observations have constrained the magnitude of upper ocean mixing associated with certain processes(3,4), but mixing rates measured directly(3,5) are significantly lower than those inferred from budget analyses(6), suggesting that other processes may play an important role. The winds associated with tropical cyclones are known to lead to localized mixing of the upper ocean(7-9), but the hypothesis that tropical cyclones are important mixing agents at the global scale(10) has not been tested. Here we calculate the effect of tropical cyclones on surface ocean temperatures by comparing surface temperatures before and after storm passage, and use these results to calculate the vertical mixing induced by tropical cyclone activity. Our results indicate that tropical cyclones are responsible for significant cooling and vertical mixing of the surface ocean in tropical regions. Assuming that all the heat that is mixed downwards is balanced by heat transport towards the poles, we calculate that approximately 15 per cent of peak ocean heat transport may be associated with the vertical mixing induced by tropical cyclones. Furthermore, our analyses show that the magnitude of this mixing is strongly related to sea surface temperature, indicating that future changes in tropical sea surface temperatures may have significant effects on ocean circulation and ocean heat transport that are not currently accounted for in climate models.","Purdue Univ, Dept Earth & Atmospher Sci, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA; Purdue Univ, Purdue Climate Change Res Ctr, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA","Huber, M (reprint author), Purdue Univ, Dept Earth & Atmospher Sci, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA.",huberm@purdue.edu,"Huber, Matthew/A-7677-2008","Huber, Matthew/0000-0002-2771-9977",,,,30,122,128,6,43,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,31-May,2007,447,7144,,,,,577,580,,10.1038/nature05785,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,172YZ,WOS:000246842000045,17538617,No,,,11/20/17

Individuals differ consistently in their behavioural tendencies and the behaviour in one context is correlated with the behaviour in multiple other contexts. From an adaptive perspective, the evolution of animal personalities is still a mystery, because a more flexible structure of behaviour should provide a selective advantage(9-11). Accordingly, many researchers view personalities as resulting from constraints imposed by the architecture of behaviour(7) (but see ref. 12). In contrast, we show here that animal personalities can be given an adaptive explanation. Our argument is based on the insight that the trade-off between current and future reproduction(13) often results in polymorphic populations(14) in which some individuals put more emphasis on future fitness returns than others. Life-history theory predicts that such differences in fitness expectations should result in systematic differences in risk-taking behaviour(15). Individuals with high future expectations (who have much to lose) should be more risk-averse than individuals with low expectations. This applies to all kinds of risky situations, so individuals should consistently differ in their behaviour. By means of an evolutionary model we demonstrate that this basic principle results in the evolution of animal personalities. It simultaneously explains the coexistence of behavioural types, the consistency of behaviour through time and the structure of behavioural correlations across contexts. Moreover, it explains the common finding that explorative behaviour and risk-related traits like boldness and aggressiveness are common characteristics of animal personalities(2-8).","Univ Groningen, Theoret Biol Grp, Ctr Ecol & Evolutionary Studies, NL-9751 NN Haren, Netherlands; Stockholm Univ, Dept Zool, SE-10691 Stockholm, Sweden","Weissing, FJ (reprint author), Univ Groningen, Theoret Biol Grp, Ctr Ecol & Evolutionary Studies, NL-9751 NN Haren, Netherlands.",f.j.weissing@rug.nl,"van Doorn, G.

In ecological speciation, reproductive isolation between populations evolves as a by-product of divergent selection and the resulting environment-specific adaptations(4-6). The leading genetic model of reproductive isolation predicts that hybrid inferiority is caused by antagonistic epistasis between incompatible alleles at interacting loci(1,7). The fundamental link between divergent adaptation and reproductive isolation through genetic incompatibilities has been predicted(1,4,5), but has not been directly demonstrated experimentally. Here we empirically tested key predictions of speciation theory by evolving the initial stages of speciation in experimental populations of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. After replicate populations adapted to two divergent environments, we consistently observed the evolution of two forms of postzygotic isolation in hybrids: reduced rate of mitotic reproduction and reduced efficiency of meiotic reproduction. This divergent selection resulted in greater reproductive isolation than parallel selection, as predicted by the ecological speciation theory. Our experimental system allowed controlled comparison of the relative importance of ecological and genetic isolation, and we demonstrated that hybrid inferiority can be ecological and/or genetic in basis. Overall, our results show that adaptation to divergent environments promotes the evolution of reproductive isolation through antagonistic epistasis, providing evidence of a plausible common avenue to speciation and adaptive radiation in nature.","Univ Toronto, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Mississauga, ON L5L 1C6, Canada","Dettman, JR (reprint author), Univ Toronto, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Mississauga, ON L5L 1C6, Canada.",jdettman@utm.utoronto.ca,,,,,,30,110,112,1,53,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,31-May,2007,447,7144,,,,,585,+,,10.1038/nature05856,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,172YZ,WOS:000246842000047,17538619,No,,,11/20/17

When adults perform mental arithmetic, they activate nonsymbolic, approximate number representations(3,4), and their performance suffers if this nonsymbolic system is impaired(5). Nonsymbolic number representations also allow adults, children, and even infants to add or subtract pairs of dot arrays and to compare the resulting sum or difference to a third array, provided that only approximate accuracy is required(6-10). Here we report that young children, who have mastered verbal counting and are on the threshold of arithmetic instruction, can build on their nonsymbolic number system to perform symbolic addition and subtraction(11-15). Children across a broad socio-economic spectrum solved symbolic problems involving approximate addition or subtraction of large numbers, both in a laboratory test and in a school setting. Aspects of symbolic arithmetic therefore lie within the reach of children who have learned no algorithms for manipulating numerical symbols. Our findings help to delimit the sources of children's difficulties learning symbolic arithmetic, and they suggest ways to enhance children's engagement with formal mathematics.","Univ Nottingham, Learning Sci Res Inst, Nottingham NG8 1BB, England; Harvard Univ, Dept Psychol, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA","Gilmore, CK (reprint author), Univ Nottingham, Learning Sci Res Inst, Wollaton Rd, Nottingham NG8 1BB, England.",camilla.gilmore@nottingham.ac.uk; spelke@wjh.harvard.edu,"Gilmore, Camilla/G-1425-2012",,,,,19,131,133,3,39,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,31-May,2007,447,7144,,,,,589,+,,10.1038/nature05850,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,172YZ,WOS:000246842000048,17538620,No,,,11/20/17

Much of this diversity is mediated by guanine nucleotide exchange factors ( GEFs) that activate Rho family GTPases - the master regulators of the actin cytoskeleton(1-3). There are over 80 Rho GEFs in the human genome ( compared to only 22 genes for the Rho GTPases themselves), and the evolution of new and diverse GEFs is thought to provide a mechanism for linking the core cytoskeletal machinery to a wide range of new control inputs. Here we test this hypothesis and ask if we can systematically reprogramme cellular morphology by engineering synthetic GEF proteins. We focused on Dbl family Rho GEFs, which have a highly modular structure common to many signalling proteins(4,5): they contain a catalytic Dbl homology (DH) domain linked to diverse regulatory domains, many of which autoinhibit GEF activity(2,3). Here we show that by recombining catalytic GEF domains with new regulatory modules, we can generate synthetic GEFs that are activated by non-native inputs. We have used these synthetic GEFs to reprogramme cellular behaviour in diverse ways. The GEFs can be used to link specific cytoskeletal responses to normally unrelated upstream signalling pathways. In addition, multiple synthetic GEFs can be linked as components in series to form an artificial cascade with improved signal processing behaviour. These results show the high degree of evolutionary plasticity of this important family of modular signalling proteins, and indicate that it may be possible to use synthetic biology approaches to manipulate the complex spatio-temporal control of cell morphology.","Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Mol & Cellular Pharmacol, San Francisco, CA USA; Univ Calif San Francisco, Cell Propuls Lab, UCSF UCB NIH Nanomed Dev Ctr, San Francisco, CA USA; Univ Calif San Francisco, Chem & Chem Biol Grad Program, San Francisco, CA USA; SUNY Stony Brook, Sch Med, Dept Mol Genet & Microbiol, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA; NYU, Sch Med, Dept Biochem, New York, NY 10016 USA","Bar-Sagi, D (reprint author), Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Mol & Cellular Pharmacol, San Francisco, CA USA.",dafna.bar-sagi@med.nyu.edu; lim@cmp.ucsf.edu,"Xu, Yunjian/A-2036-2012",,,,,30,87,89,0,11,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,31-May,2007,447,7144,,,,,596,600,,10.1038/nature05851,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,172YZ,WOS:000246842000050,17515921,No,,,11/20/17

Here we show that JARID1C/SMCX, a JmjC-domain-containing protein implicated in X-linked mental retardation and epilepsy(3,4), possesses H3K4 tri-demethylase activity and functions as a transcriptional repressor. An SMCX complex isolated from HeLa cells contains additional chromatin modifiers (the histone deacetylases HDAC1 and HDAC2, and the histone H3K9 methyltransferase G9a) and the transcriptional repressor REST(5), suggesting a direct role for SMCX in chromatin dynamics and REST-mediated repression. Chromatin immunoprecipitation reveals that SMCX and REST co-occupy the neuron-restrictive silencing elements in the promoters of a subset of REST target genes. RNA-interference-mediated depletion of SMCX derepresses several of these targets and simultaneously increases H3K4 trimethylation at the sodium channel type 2A (SCN2A) and synapsin I (SYN1) promoters.

PCNA and RP-A allowed correct incorporation of dCTP opposite a 8-oxo-G template 1,200-fold more efficiently than the incorrect dATP by DNA pol lambda, and 68-fold by DNA pol eta, respectively. Experiments with DNA-pol-lambda-null cell extracts suggested an important role for DNA pol lambda. On the other hand, DNA pol iota, together with DNA pols a, delta and beta, showed a much lower correct bypass efficiency.

They show photoluminescence with high quantum yields, and their emission colours depend on the nanocrystal size - owing to the quantum-confinement effect - and are therefore tunable. However, nanocrystals are difficult to use in optical amplification and lasing. Because of an almost exact balance between absorption and stimulated emission in nanoparticles excited with single electron - hole pairs (excitons), optical gain can only occur in nanocrystals that contain at least two excitons. A complication associated with this multiexcitonic nature of light amplification is fast optical-gain decay induced by non-radiative Auger recombination, a process in which one exciton recombines by transferring its energy to another. Here we demonstrate a practical approach for obtaining optical gain in the single-exciton regime that eliminates the problem of Auger decay. Specifically, we develop core/ shell hetero-nanocrystals engineered in such a way as to spatially separate electrons and holes between the core and the shell (type-II heterostructures). The resulting imbalance between negative and positive charges produces a strong local electric field, which induces a giant (similar to 100 meV or greater) transient Stark shift of the absorption spectrum with respect to the luminescence line of singly excited nanocrystals. This effect breaks the exact balance between absorption and stimulated emission, and allows us to demonstrate optical amplification due to single excitons.","Los Alamos Natl Lab, Los Alamos, NM 87545 USA","Klimov, VI (reprint author), Los Alamos Natl Lab, POB 1663, Los Alamos, NM 87545 USA.",klimov@lanl.gov,"Piryatinski, Andrei/B-5543-2009; Ivanov, Sergei/B-5505-2011; Achermann, Marc/A-1849-2011; McGuire, John/C-3380-2015","Piryatinski, Andrei/0000-0001-9218-1678; Achermann, Marc/0000-0002-3939-9309; McGuire, John/0000-0002-0682-0953; Klimov, Victor/0000-0003-1158-3179",,,,22,589,595,25,301,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,24-May,2007,447,7143,,,,,441,446,,10.1038/nature05839,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,170VA,WOS:000246693100040,17522678,No,Y,N,11/20/17

It is well established that the remodelling process is aided by specialized proteins that can sense(4) as well as create(6) membrane curvature, and trigger tubulation(7-9) when added to synthetic liposomes. Because the energy needed for such large-scale changes in membrane geometry significantly exceeds the binding energy between individual proteins and between protein and membrane, cooperative action is essential. It has recently been suggested(10,11) that curvature-mediated attractive interactions could aid cooperation and complement the effects of specific binding events on membrane remodelling. But it is difficult to experimentally isolate curvature-mediated interactions from direct attractions between proteins. Moreover, approximate theories predict repulsion between isotropically curving proteins(12-15). Here we use coarse-grained membrane simulations to show that curvature-inducing model proteins adsorbed on lipid bilayer membranes can experience attractive interactions that arise purely as a result of membrane curvature. We find that once a minimal local bending is realized, the effect robustly drives protein cluster formation and subsequent transformation into vesicles with radii that correlate with the local curvature imprint. Owing to its universal nature, curvature-mediated attraction can operate even between proteins lacking any specific interactions, such as newly synthesized and still immature membrane proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum.","Max Planck Inst Polymer Res, D-55128 Mainz, Germany","Deserno, M (reprint author), Max Planck Inst Polymer Res, Ackermannweg 10, D-55128 Mainz, Germany.",kremer@mpip-mainz.mpg.de; deserno@mpip-mainz.mpg.de,"Muller, Martin Michael/B-3677-2009; Kremer, Kurt/G-5652-2011; Harmandaris, Vagelis/B-2958-2009; Harmandaris, Vagelis/A-7102-2012; MPIP, Theory/I-9884-2014; Deserno, Markus/P-1699-2014","Harmandaris, Vagelis/0000-0002-9613-7639; Harmandaris, Vagelis/0000-0002-9613-7639; Deserno, Markus/0000-0001-5692-1595",,,,29,398,402,14,166,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,24-May,2007,447,7143,,,,,461,464,,10.1038/nature05840,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,170VA,WOS:000246693100044,17522680,No,,,11/20/17

It has been proposed that an increase in sea surface temperatures caused by anthropogenic climate change has led to an increase in the frequency of intense tropical cyclones(2,3), but this proposal has been challenged on the basis that the instrumental record is too short and unreliable to reveal trends in intense tropical cyclone activity(4). Storm-induced deposits preserved in the sediments of coastal lagoons offer the opportunity to study the links between climatic conditions and hurricane activity on longer timescales, because they provide centennial- to millennial-scale records of past hurricane landfalls(5-8). Here we present a record of intense hurricane activity in the western North Atlantic Ocean over the past 5,000 years based on sediment cores from a Caribbean lagoon that contain coarse-grained deposits associated with intense hurricane landfalls. The record indicates that the frequency of intense hurricane landfalls has varied on centennial to millennial scales over this interval. Comparison of the sediment record with palaeo-climate records indicates that this variability was probably modulated by atmospheric dynamics associated with variations in the El Nino/ Southern Oscillation and the strength of the West African monsoon, and suggests that sea surface temperatures as high as at present are not necessary to support intervals of frequent intense hurricanes. To accurately predict changes in intense hurricane activity, it is therefore important to understand how the El Nino/ Southern Oscillation and the West African monsoon will respond to future climate change.","Woods Hole Oceanog Inst, Coastal Syst Grp, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA","Donnelly, JP (reprint author), Woods Hole Oceanog Inst, Coastal Syst Grp, 360 Woods Hole Rd, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA.",jdonnelly@whoi.edu,,,,,,30,194,202,11,82,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,24-May,2007,447,7143,,,,,465,468,,10.1038/nature05834,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,170VA,WOS:000246693100045,17522681,No,,,11/20/17

Each approach has its own analytical strengths, but given certain assumptions they provide equivalent results(1). In most instances the structure of the population can be specified by a network of nodes connected by edges ( that is, a graph)(8-10), and much of the work here has focused on a continuous-time model of evolution, first described by ref. 11. Working in this context, we provide an inclusive fitness analysis to derive a surprisingly simple analytical condition for the selective advantage of a cooperative allele in any graph for which the structure satisfies a general symmetry condition ('bi-transitivity'). Our results hold for a broad class of population structures, including most of those analysed previously, as well as some for which a direct calculation of fixation probability has appeared intractable. Notably, under some forms of population regulation, the ability of a cooperative allele to invade is seen to be independent of the nature of population structure ( and in particular of how game partnerships are specified) and is identical to that for an unstructured population. For other types of population regulation our results reveal that cooperation can invade if players choose partners along relatively 'high-weight' edges.","Queens Univ, Dept Math & Stat, Kingston, ON K7L 3N6, Canada","Taylor, PD (reprint author), Queens Univ, Dept Math & Stat, Kingston, ON K7L 3N6, Canada.",peter.taylor@queensu.ca,,,,,,19,159,161,2,24,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,24-May,2007,447,7143,,,,,469,472,,10.1038/nature05784,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,170VA,WOS:000246693100046,17522682,No,Y,N,11/20/17

Data from fossils support the notion that the unique features of tetrapod limbs were assembled over evolutionary time in the paired fins of fish(5). The challenge in linking developmental and palaeontological approaches has been that developmental data for fins and limbs compare only highly derived teleosts and tetrapods; what is lacking are data from extant taxa that retain greater portions of the fin skeletal morphology considered primitive to all bony fish(6,7). Here, we report on the expression and function of genes implicated in the origin of the autopod in a basal actinopterygian, Polyodon spathula. Polyodon exhibits a late-phase, inverted collinear expression of 5' HoxD genes, a pattern of expression long considered a developmental hallmark of the autopod and shown in tetrapods to be controlled by a 'digit enhancer' region. These data show that aspects of the development of the autopod are primitive to tetrapods and that the origin of digits entailed the redeployment of ancient patterns of gene activity.","Univ Chicago, Dept Organismal Biol & Anat, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; Field Museum Nat Hist, Chicago, IL 60605 USA","Shubin, NH (reprint author), Univ Chicago, Dept Organismal Biol & Anat, 1025 E 57Th St, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.",nshubin@uchicago.edu,,,,,,22,82,85,1,29,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,24-May,2007,447,7143,,,,,473,U3,,10.1038/nature05838,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,170VA,WOS:000246693100047,17522683,No,,,11/20/17

Here we show that PGC-1 alpha (Ppargc1a), a transcriptional coactivator that regulates energy metabolism(3-9), is rhythmically expressed in the liver and skeletal muscle of mice. PGC-1 alpha stimulates the expression of clock genes, notably Bmal1 (Arntl) and Rev-erba (Nr1d1), through coactivation of the ROR family of orphan nuclear receptors. Mice lacking PGC-1 alpha show abnormal diurnal rhythms of activity, body temperature and metabolic rate. The disruption of physiological rhythms in these animals is correlated with aberrant expression of clock genes and those involved in energy metabolism. Analyses of PGC-1 alpha-deficient fibroblasts and mice with liver-specific knockdown of PGC-1 alpha indicate that it is required for cell-autonomous clock function. We have thus identified PGC-1 alpha as a key component of the circadian oscillator that integrates the mammalian clock and energy metabolism.","Univ Michigan, Med Ctr, Inst Life Sci, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; Univ Michigan, Med Ctr, Dept Cell & Dev Biol, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; Univ Michigan, Med Ctr, Dept Mol & Integrat Physiol, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA","Lin, JD (reprint author), Univ Michigan, Med Ctr, Inst Life Sci, 1500 E Med Ctr Dr, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",jdlin@umich.edu,,,,,,30,339,358,4,41,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,24-May,2007,447,7143,,,,,477,U4,,10.1038/nature05767,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,170VA,WOS:000246693100048,17476214,No,,,11/20/17

However, many progressing tumours in humans counter this anti-tumour activity by shedding the soluble major histocompatibility complex class-I-related ligand MICA, which induces internalization and degradation of NKG2D and stimulates population expansions of normally rare NKG2D(+) CD4(+) T cells with negative regulatory functions(7-9). Here we show that on the surface of tumour cells, MICA associates with endoplasmic reticulum protein 5 (ERp5; also called PDIA6 or P5), which, similar to protein disulphide isomerase, usually assists in the folding of nascent proteins inside cells(10). Pharmacological inhibition of thioreductase activity and ERp5 gene silencing revealed that cell-surface ERp5 function is required for MICA shedding. ERp5 and membrane-anchored MICA form transitory mixed disulphide complexes from which soluble MICA is released after proteolytic cleavage near the cell membrane. Reduction of the seemingly inaccessible disulphide bond in the membrane-proximal alpha 3 domain of MICA must involve a large conformational change that enables proteolytic cleavage. These results uncover a molecular mechanism whereby domain-specific deconstruction regulates MICA protein shedding, thereby promoting tumour immune evasion, and identify surface ERp5 as a strategic target for therapeutic intervention.","Fred Hutchinson Canc Res Ctr, Seattle, WA 98109 USA","Chow, IT (reprint author), Fred Hutchinson Canc Res Ctr, 1100 Fairview Ave N, Seattle, WA 98109 USA.",,,"Gonzalez-Rodriguez, Segundo/0000-0003-4631-9255",,,,28,197,209,0,11,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,24-May,2007,447,7143,,,,,482,U5,,10.1038/nature05768,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,170VA,WOS:000246693100049,17495932,No,,,11/20/17

Reversal of MAPK activation requires the transcriptional induction of specialized cysteine-based phosphatases that mediate MAPK dephosphorylation(3). Paradoxically, oxidative stresses generally inactivate cysteine-based phosphatases by thiol modification and thus could lead to sustained or uncontrolled MAPK activation(4,5). Here we describe how the stress-inducible MAPK phosphatase, Sdp1, presents an unusual solution to this apparent paradox by acquiring enhanced catalytic activity under oxidative conditions. Structural and biochemical evidence reveals that Sdp1 employs an intramolecular disulphide bridge and an invariant histidine side chain to selectively recognize a tyrosine-phosphorylated MAPK substrate. Optimal activity critically requires the disulphide bridge, and thus, to the best of our knowledge, Sdp1 is the first example of a cysteine-dependent phosphatase that couples oxidative stress with substrate recognition. We show that Sdp1, and its paralogue Msg5, have similar properties and belong to a new group of phosphatases unique to yeast and fungal taxa.","Canc Res UK, Struct Biol Lab, London Res Inst, London WC2A 3PX, England; Canc Res UK, Prot Anal Lab, London Res Inst, London WC2A 3PX, England; Univ London Birkbeck Coll, Sch Crystallog, London WC1E 7HX, England; Ninewells Hosp, Canc Res UK, Stress Response Lab, Ctr Biomed Res, Dundee DD1 9SY, Scotland; Univ Dundee, Div Gene Regulat & Express, Coll Life Sci, Dundee DD1 5EH, Scotland","McDonald, NQ (reprint author), Canc Res UK, Struct Biol Lab, London Res Inst, 44 Lincolns Inn Fields, London WC2A 3PX, England.",neil.mcdonald@cancer.org.uk,"Briggs, David/F-1199-2010; Keyse, Stephen/B-9575-2009; Stark, Michael/B-2815-2014","Keyse, Stephen/0000-0002-5150-8221; Stark, Michael/0000-0001-9086-191X; Briggs, David/0000-0002-9793-7339",Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council [BB/C007077/1],,,30,28,30,0,4,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,24-May,2007,447,7143,,,,,487,492,,10.1038/nature05804,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,170VA,WOS:000246693100050,17495930,No,,,11/20/17

Observations of the south pole revealed large rifts in the crust, informally called 'tiger stripes', which exhibit higher temperatures than the surrounding terrain and are probably sources of the observed eruptions(2). Models of the ultimate interior source for the eruptions are under consideration (1,3-5). Other models of an expanding plume(6) require eruptions from discrete sources, as well as less voluminous eruptions from a more extended source, to match the observations. No physical mechanism that matches the observations has been identified to control these eruptions. Here we report a mechanism in which temporal variations in tidal stress open and close the tiger-stripe rifts, governing the timing of eruptions. During each orbit, every portion of each tiger stripe rift spends about half the time in tension, which allows the rift to open, exposing volatiles, and allowing eruptions. In a complementary process, periodic shear stress along the rifts also generates heat along their lengths(7-9), which has the capacity to enhance eruptions. Plume activity is expected to vary periodically, affecting the injection of material into Saturn's E ring(10) and its formation, evolution and structure. Moreover, the stresses controlling eruptions imply that Enceladus' icy shell behaves as a thin elastic layer, perhaps only a few tens of kilometres thick.","NASA, Goddard Space Flight Ctr, Planetary Geodynam Lab, Greenbelt, MD 20771 USA; Cornell Univ, CRSR, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; Raytheon Co, Woburn, MA 01801 USA; Univ Arizona, Lunar & Planetary Lab, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA; Univ Calif San Diego, Scripps Inst Oceanog, Inst Geophys & Planetary Phys, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA","Hurford, TA (reprint author), NASA, Goddard Space Flight Ctr, Planetary Geodynam Lab, Greenbelt, MD 20771 USA.",hurfordt@core2.gsfc.nasa.gov,"Bills, Bruce/C-1156-2008; Hurford, Terry/F-2625-2012",,,,,23,80,81,2,13,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,17-May,2007,447,7142,,,,,292,294,,10.1038/nature05821,,3,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,168JK,WOS:000246520300039,17507977,No,,,11/20/17

As these parameters are many orders of magnitude larger in semiconductors than in metals(1,2), semiconductors could be the most suitable for spintronics. So far, spin transport has only been measured in direct-bandgap semiconductors(3-9) or in combination with magnetic semiconductors, excluding a wide range of non-magnetic semiconductors with indirect bandgaps. Most notable in this group is silicon, Si, which ( in addition to its market entrenchment in electronics) has long been predicted a superior semiconductor for spintronics with enhanced lifetime and transport length due to low spin - orbit scattering and lattice inversion symmetry(10-12). Despite this promise, a demonstration of coherent spin transport in Si has remained elusive, because most experiments focused on magnetoresistive devices; these methods fail because of a fundamental impedance mismatch between ferromagnetic metal and semiconductor(13), and measurements are obscured by other magnetoelectronic effects(14). Here we demonstrate conduction-band spin transport across 10 mu m undoped Si in a device that operates by spin-dependent ballistic hot-electron filtering through ferromagnetic thin films for both spin injection and spin detection. As it is not based on magnetoresistance, the hot-electron spin injection and spin detection avoids impedance mismatch issues and prevents interference from parasitic effects. The clean collector current shows independent magnetic and electrical control of spin precession, and thus confirms spin coherent drift in the conduction band of silicon.","Univ Delaware, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Newark, DE 19716 USA; Cambridge Nano Tech Inc, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA","Appelbaum, I (reprint author), Univ Delaware, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Newark, DE 19716 USA.",appelbaum@ee.udel.edu,"Appelbaum, Ian/E-4056-2012",,,,,25,507,510,8,148,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,17-May,2007,447,7142,,,,,295,298,,10.1038/nature05803,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,168JK,WOS:000246520300040,17507978,No,Y,N,11/20/17

For example, organosilane MNLs are used as lubricants 1, in nanolithography(2), for corrosion protection(3) and in the crystallization of biominerals(4). Recent work has explored uses of MNLs at thin-film interfaces, both as active components in molecular devices(5), and as passive layers, inhibiting interfacial diffusion(6-8), promoting adhesion(9,10) and toughening brittle nanoporous structures (11). The relatively low stability of MNLs on surfaces at temperatures above 350 - 400 degrees C (refs 12, 13), as a result of desorption(14) or degradation, limits the use of surface MNLs in high-temperature applications. Here we harness MNLs at thin-film interfaces at temperatures higher than the MNL desorption temperature to fortify copper - dielectric interfaces relevant to wiring in micro- and nano-electronic devices. Annealing Cu/MNL/SiO2 structures at 400 - 700 degrees C results in interfaces that are five times tougher than pristine Cu/SiO2 structures, yielding values exceeding similar to 20 J m(-2). Previously, similarly high toughness values have only been obtained using micrometre-thick interfacial layers(15-17). Electron spectroscopy of fracture surfaces and density functional theory modelling of molecular stretching and fracture show that toughening arises from thermally activated interfacial siloxane bridging that enables the MNL to be strongly linked to both the adjacent layers at the interface, and suppresses MNL desorption. We anticipate that our findings will open up opportunities for molecular-level tailoring of a variety of interfacial properties, at processing temperatures higher than previously envisaged, for applications where microlayers are not a viable option - such as in nanodevices or in thermally resistant molecular-inorganic hybrid devices.","Rensselaer Polytech Inst, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Troy, NY 12180 USA; Rensselaer Polytech Inst, Dept Phys, Troy, NY 12180 USA; IBM Microelect, TJ Watson Res Ctr, Yorktown Hts, NY 10598 USA; Technion Israel Inst Technol, Dept Mat Engn, IL-32000 Haifa, Israel","Ramanath, G (reprint author), Rensselaer Polytech Inst, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Troy, NY 12180 USA.",ramanath@rpi.edu,"Ramanath, Ganpati/C-1157-2011","Ramanath, Ganpati/0000-0002-8718-9760",,,,28,83,85,5,84,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,17-May,2007,447,7142,,,,,299,U2,,10.1038/nature05826,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,168JK,WOS:000246520300041,17507979,No,,,11/20/17

It has been proposed that studying inclusions of melt trapped in early crystallizing phenocrysts such as Mg-rich olivine and chromite may help petrologists to see beyond the later-stage processes and back to the origin of the partial melts in the mantle(1,2). Melt inclusion suites often span a much greater compositional range than associated erupted lavas, and a significant minority of inclusions carry distinct compositions that have been claimed to sample melts from earlier stages of melt production, preserving separate contributions from mantle heterogeneities(1-4). This hypothesis is underpinned by the assumption that melt inclusions, once trapped, remain chemically isolated from the external magma for all elements except those that are compatible in the host minerals(1,2). Here we show that the fluxes of rare-earth elements through olivine and chromite by lattice diffusion are sufficiently rapid at magmatic temperatures to reequilibrate completely the rare-earth-element patterns of trapped melt inclusions in times that are short compared to those estimated for the production and ascent of mantle-derived magma(5,6) or for magma residence in the crust(7). Phenocryst-hosted melt inclusions with anomalous trace-element signatures must therefore form shortly before magma eruption and cooling. We conclude that the assumption of chemical isolation of incompatible elements in olivine- and chromite-hosted melt inclusions(1,2) is not valid, and we call for re-evaluation of the popular interpretation that anomalous melt inclusions represent preserved samples of unmodified mantle melts.","Australian Natl Univ, Res Sch Earth Sci, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia; Univ Tasmania, Sch Earth Sci, Hobart, Tas 7001, Australia; Univ Tasmania, ARC Ctr Excellence Ore Deposits, Hobart, Tas 7001, Australia","Spandler, C (reprint author), Univ Bern, Inst Geol Sci, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland.",spandler@geo.unibe.ch; hugh.oneill@anu.edu.au,"Kamenetsky, Vadim/B-1019-2008; O'Neill, Hugh/G-2302-2011","Kamenetsky, Vadim/0000-0002-2734-8790; O'Neill, Hugh/0000-0001-7018-9783; Spandler, Carl/0000-0003-2310-0517",,,,30,71,73,0,36,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,17-May,2007,447,7142,,,,,303,306,,10.1038/nature05759,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,168JK,WOS:000246520300042,17507980,No,,,11/20/17

The deeper parts of the Southern Ocean exhibit some unique environmental features, including a very deep continental shelf(2) and a weakly stratified water column, and are the source for much of the deep water in the world ocean. These features suggest that deep-sea faunas around the Antarctic may be related both to adjacent shelf communities and to those in other oceans. Unlike shallow-water Antarctic benthic communities, however, little is known about life in this vast deep-sea region(2,3). Here, we report new data from recent sampling expeditions in the deep Weddell Sea and adjacent areas ( 748 - 6,348 m water depth) that reveal high levels of new biodiversity; for example, 674 isopods species, of which 585 were new to science. Bathymetric and biogeographic trends varied between taxa. In groups such as the isopods and polychaetes, slope assemblages included species that have invaded from the shelf. In other taxa, the shelf and slope assemblages were more distinct. Abyssal faunas tended to have stronger links to other oceans, particularly the Atlantic, but mainly in taxa with good dispersal capabilities, such as the Foraminifera. The isopods, ostracods and nematodes, which are poor dispersers, include many species currently known only from the Southern Ocean. Our findings challenge suggestions that deep-sea diversity is depressed in the Southern Ocean and provide a basis for exploring the evolutionary significance of the varied biogeographic patterns observed in this remote environment.","Zool Museum Hamburg, D-20146 Hamburg, Germany; Natl Oceanog Ctr, Southampton SO14 3ZH, Hants, England; Univ Aarhus, Dept Marine Ecol, DK-8200 Aarhus, Denmark; Inst Royal Sci Nat Belgique, B-1000 Brussels, Belgium; Univ Ghent, Dept Biol, Marine Biol Sect, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium; Virginia Inst Marine Sci, Coll William & Mary, Gloucester Point, VA 23062 USA; Univ Libre Bruxelles, Marine Biol Lab, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium; Forschungsmuseum Konig, Forschungsinst Senckenberg, DZMB CeDAMar, D-53113 Bonn, Germany; Scottish Assoc Marine Sci, Dunstaffnage Marine Lab, Oban PA37 1QA, Argyll, Scotland; Forschungs & Nat Museum Senckenberg, D-60325 Frankfurt, Germany; British Antarctic Survey, NERC, Cambridge CB3 0ET, England; FEB RAS, Inst Marine Biol, Vladivostok 690041, Russia; Univ Geneva, Dept Zool & Anim Biol, CH-1211 Geneva 4, Switzerland; Ruhr Univ Bochum, D-44780 Bochum, Germany","Brandt, A (reprint author), Zool Museum Hamburg, Martin Luther King Pl 3, D-20146 Hamburg, Germany.",abrandt@zoologie.uni-hamburg.de,"Raupach, Michael/G-7072-2012; Cedhagen, Tomas/J-6426-2013; Brandao, Simone/K-4672-2012","Cedhagen, Tomas/0000-0003-4550-8177; Brandao, Simone Nunes/0000-0002-3487-6129",,,,29,250,264,7,106,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,17-May,2007,447,7142,,,,,307,311,,10.1038/nature05827,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,168JK,WOS:000246520300043,17507981,No,Y,N,11/20/17

Gene expression that is dependent on the parent of origin has also been observed in the offspring of flowering plants, and mutations in the imprinting machinery lead to embryonic lethality, primarily affecting the development of the endosperm - a structure in the seed that nourishes the embryo, analogous to the function of the mammalian placenta(4). Here we have generated Arabidopsis thaliana seeds in which the endosperm is of uniparental, that is, maternal, origin. We demonstrate that imprinting in developing seeds can be bypassed and viable albeit smaller seedlings can develop from seeds lacking a paternal contribution to the endosperm. Bypassing is only possible if the mother is mutant for any of the FIS-class genes, which encode Polycomb group chromatin-modifying factors. Thus, these data provide functional evidence that the action of the FIS complex balances the contribution of the paternal genome. As flowering plants have evolved a special reproduction system with a parallel fusion of two female with two male gametes, our findings support the hypothesis that only with the evolution of double fertilization did the action of the FIS genes become a requirement for seed development. Furthermore, our data argue for a gametophytic origin of endosperm in flowering plants, thereby supporting a hypothesis raised in 1900 by Eduard Strasburger.","Univ Cologne, Dept Bot 3, Max Delbruck Lab, Max Planck Inst Plant Breeding Res,Univ Grp, D-50829 Cologne, Germany; Univ Oslo, Dept Mol Biosci, N-0316 Oslo, Norway; Inst Mol Med & Expt Immunol, D-53105 Bonn, Germany","Schnittger, A (reprint author), Univ Cologne, Dept Bot 3, Max Delbruck Lab, Max Planck Inst Plant Breeding Res,Univ Grp, Carl von Linne Weg 10, D-50829 Cologne, Germany.",schnitt@mpiz-koeln.mpg.de,"Schnittger, Arp/F-8989-2010; Grini, Paul/H-9471-2016; Dissmeyer, Nico/A-4738-2015","Schnittger, Arp/0000-0001-7067-0091; Grini, Paul/0000-0003-3898-6277; Dissmeyer, Nico/0000-0002-4156-3761; Nowack, Moritz/0000-0001-8918-7577",,,,34,64,66,2,11,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,17-May,2007,447,7142,,,,,312,U3,,10.1038/nature05770,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,168JK,WOS:000246520300044,17468744,No,,,11/20/17

However, the possibility that hair follicles develop de novo following wounding was raised in studies on rabbits (2,3), mice(4) and even humans fifty years ago(5). Subsequently, these observations were generally discounted because definitive evidence for follicular neogenesis was not presented(6). Here we show that, after wounding, hair follicles form de novo in genetically normal adult mice. The regenerated hair follicles establish a stem cell population, express known molecular markers of follicle differentiation, produce a hair shaft and progress through all stages of the hair follicle cycle. Lineage analysis demonstrated that the nascent follicles arise from epithelial cells outside of the hair follicle stem cell niche, suggesting that epidermal cells in the wound assume a hair follicle stem cell phenotype. Inhibition of Wnt signalling after re-epithelialization completely abrogates this wounding-induced folliculogenesis, whereas overexpression of Wnt ligand in the epidermis increases the number of regenerated hair follicles. These remarkable regenerative capabilities of the adult support the notion that wounding induces an embryonic phenotype in skin, and that this provides a window for manipulation of hair follicle neogenesis by Wnt proteins. These findings suggest treatments for wounds, hair loss and other degenerative skin disorders.","Univ Penn, Sch Med, Dept Dermatol, Kligman Labs, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA","Cotsarelis, G (reprint author), Univ Penn, Sch Med, Dept Dermatol, Kligman Labs, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",cotsarel@mail.med.upenn.edu,,,,,,31,396,415,56,112,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,17-May,2007,447,7142,,,,,316,U4,,10.1038/nature05766,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,168JK,WOS:000246520300045,17507982,No,,,11/20/17

The identification of SUMO substrates outside the nucleus is progressing(2) but little is yet known about the wider cellular role of protein SUMOylation. Here we report that in rat hippocampal neurons multiple SUMOylation targets are present at synapses and we show that the kainate receptor subunit GluR6 is a SUMO substrate. SUMOylation of GluR6 regulates endocytosis of the kainate receptor and modifies synaptic transmission. GluR6 exhibits low levels of SUMOylation under resting conditions and is rapidly SUMOylated in response to a kainate but not an N-methyl-D-aspartate ( NMDA) treatment. Reducing GluR6 SUMOylation using the SUMO-specific isopeptidase SENP1 prevents kainate-evoked endocytosis of the kainate receptor. Furthermore, a mutated non-SUMOylatable form of GluR6 is not endocytosed in response to kainate in COS-7 cells. Consistent with this, electrophysiological recordings in hippocampal slices demonstrate that kainate-receptor-mediated excitatory postsynaptic currents are decreased by SUMOylation and enhanced by deSUMOylation.

After clearance of acute infection, herpesviruses enter a dormant state known as latency. Latency persists for the life of the host and is presumed to be parasitic, as it leaves the individual at risk for subsequent viral reactivation and disease(1). Here we show that herpesvirus latency also confers a surprising benefit to the host. Mice latently infected with either murine gammaherpesvirus 68 or murine cytomegalovirus, which are genetically highly similar to the human pathogens Epstein - Barr virus and human cytomegalovirus(2), respectively, are resistant to infection with the bacterial pathogens Listeria monocytogenes and Yersinia pestis. Latency-induced protection is not antigen specific but involves prolonged production of the antiviral cytokine interferon-gamma and systemic activation of macrophages. Latency thereby upregulates the basal activation state of innate immunity against subsequent infections. We speculate that herpesvirus latency may also sculpt the immune response to self and environmental antigens through establishment of a polarized cytokine environment. Thus, whereas the immune evasion capabilities and lifelong persistence of herpesviruses are commonly viewed as solely pathogenic, our data suggest that latency is a symbiotic relationship with immune benefits for the host.","Washington Univ, Sch Med, Dept Pathol & Immunol, St Louis, MO 63110 USA; Washington Univ, Sch Med, Dept Mol Microbiol, St Louis, MO 63110 USA; Washington Univ, Sch Med, Dept Med, St Louis, MO 63110 USA; Washington Univ, Sch Med, Dept Pediat, St Louis, MO 63110 USA; Washington Univ, Sch Med, Div Rheumatol, St Louis, MO 63110 USA","Virgin, HW (reprint author), Washington Univ, Sch Med, Dept Pathol & Immunol, 660 S Euclid Ave, St Louis, MO 63110 USA.",virgin@wustl.edu,,"Miller, Virginia/0000-0002-9522-1767; White, Douglas/0000-0002-0366-9047",,,,30,309,316,1,33,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,17-May,2007,447,7142,,,,,326,U7,,10.1038/nature05762,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,168JK,WOS:000246520300047,17507983,No,,,11/20/17

We show here that H. pylori CagA specifically interacts with PAR1/MARK kinase, which has an essential role in epithelial cell polarity(10,11). Association of CagA inhibits PAR1 kinase activity and prevents atypical protein kinase C ( aPKC)-mediated PAR1 phosphorylation, which dissociates PAR1 from the membrane(12,13), collectively causing junctional and polarity defects. Because of the multimeric nature of PAR1 (ref. 14), PAR1 also promotes CagA multimerization, which stabilizes the CagA - SHP2 interaction(15). Furthermore, induction of the hummingbird phenotype by CagA-activated SHP2 requires simultaneous inhibition of PAR1 kinase activity by CagA. Thus, the CagA - PAR1 interaction not only elicits the junctional and polarity defects but also promotes the morphogenetic activity of CagA. Our findings revealed that PAR1 is a key target of H. pylori CagA in the disorganization of gastric epithelial architecture underlying mucosal damage, inflammation and carcinogenesis.","Hokkaido Univ, Grad Sch Sci, Inst Med Genet, Div Mol Oncol, Sapporo, Hokkaido 0600815, Japan; Hokkaido Univ, Grad Sch Sci, Div Chem, Sapporo, Hokkaido 0600815, Japan; Hokkaido Univ, Grad Sch Life Sci, Div Mol Life Sci, Sapporo, Hokkaido 0010021, Japan; Kobe Univ, Grad Sch Med, Internal Ctr Med Res & Treatment, Kobe, Hyogo 6500017, Japan; Yokohama City Univ, Grad Sch Med Sci, Dept Mol Biol, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2360004, Japan","Hatakeyama, M (reprint author), Hokkaido Univ, Grad Sch Sci, Inst Med Genet, Div Mol Oncol, Sapporo, Hokkaido 0600815, Japan.",mhata@igm.hokudai.ac.jp,"OHNISHI, Naomi/F-6914-2012; Higashi, Hideaki/F-6872-2012; Obuse, Chikashi/F-5273-2011","OHNISHI, Naomi/0000-0002-2382-3152; Ohno, Shigeo/0000-0002-1294-5269",,,,30,256,266,1,17,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,17-May,2007,447,7142,,,,,330,U8,,10.1038/nature05765,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,168JK,WOS:000246520300048,17507984,No,,,11/20/17

Because the nuclear envelope persists during mitosis ( closed mitosis) in fission yeast ( Schizosaccharomyces pombe), cytoplasmic microtubules must be reorganized into the spindle in the compartmentalized nucleus on mitotic entry(2). An ideal mechanism might be to take advantage of an evolutionarily conserved microtubule formation system that uses the Ran-GTPase nuclear transport machinery(3-5), but no targets of Ran for spindle formation have been identified in yeast. Here we show that a microtubule-associated protein, Alp7, which forms a complex with Alp14, is a target of Ran in yeast for spindle formation. The Ran-deficient pim1 mutant (pim1-F201S) failed to show mitosis-specific nuclear accumulation of Alp7. Moreover, this mutant exhibited compromised spindle formation and early mitotic delay. Importantly, these defects were suppressed by Alp7 that was artificially targeted to the nucleus by a Ran-independent and importin-alpha-mediated system. Thus, Ran targets Alp7 - Alp14 to achieve nuclear spindle formation, and might differentiate its targets depending on whether the organism undergoes closed or open mitosis.","Canc Res UK, London Res Inst, Lincolns Inn Fields Labs, Lab Cell Regulat, London WC2A 3PX, England","Sato, M (reprint author), Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Sci, Dept Biophys & Biochem, Tokyo 1130033, Japan.",masasato@biochem.s.u-tokyo.ac.jp; Takashi.Toda@cancer.org.uk,,,,,,33,43,43,0,2,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,17-May,2007,447,7142,,,,,334,U9,,10.1038/nature05773,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,168JK,WOS:000246520300049,17476213,No,,,11/20/17

Despite its abundance in the nucleus, there has been no evidence for a direct role of RNA as a template in the repair of any chromosomal DNA lesions, including DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), which are repaired in most organisms by homologous recombination or by non-homologous end joining(3). An indirect role for RNA in DNA repair, following reverse transcription and formation of a complementary DNA, has been observed in the non-homologous joining of DSB ends(4,5). In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, in which homologous recombination is efficient(3), RNA was shown to mediate recombination, but only indirectly through a cDNA intermediate(6,7) generated by the reverse transcriptase function of Ty retrotransposons in Ty particles in the cytoplasm(8). Although pairing between duplex DNA and single-strand (ss) RNA can occur in vitro(9,10) and in vivo(11), direct homologous exchange of genetic information between RNA and DNA molecules has not been observed. We show here that RNA can serve as a template for DNA synthesis during repair of a chromosomal DSB in yeast. The repair was accomplished with RNA oligonucleotides complementary to the broken ends. This and the observation that even yeast replicative DNA polymerases such as alpha and delta can copy short RNA template tracts in vitro demonstrate that RNA can transfer genetic information in vivo through direct homologous interaction with chromosomal DNA.","NIEHS, Mol Biol Lab, NIH, US Dept HHS, Res Triangle Pk, NC 27709 USA","Resnick, MA (reprint author), NIEHS, Mol Biol Lab, NIH, US Dept HHS, POB 12233, Res Triangle Pk, NC 27709 USA.",resnick@niehs.nih.gov,,"Gordenin, Dmitry/0000-0002-8399-1836",Intramural NIH HHS [Z01 ES065072-17],,,29,90,94,0,23,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,17-May,2007,447,7142,,,,,338,341,,10.1038/nature05720,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,168JK,WOS:000246520300050,17429354,No,,,11/20/17

The use of a designed, synthetic substrate analogue allows unique insights into the chemistry of oxygen activation. The structure confirms the absence of cofactors, and electron density consistent with molecular oxygen is present adjacent to the site of oxidation on the substrate. Molecular oxygen is bound in a small hydrophobic pocket and the substrate provides the reducing power to activate oxygen for downstream chemical steps. Our results resolve the unique and complex chemistry of DpgC, a key enzyme in the biosynthetic pathway of an important class of antibiotics(2).

An important aspect in pre-clinical research is the exploration of strategies to re-establish learning ability and access to long-term memories. By using a mouse model that allows temporally and spatially restricted induction of neuronal loss, we show here that environmental enrichment reinstated learning behaviour and re-established access to long-term memories after significant brain atrophy and neuronal loss had already occurred. Environmental enrichment correlated with chromatin modifications ( increased histone-tail acetylation). Moreover, increased histone acetylation by inhibitors of histone deacetylases induced sprouting of dendrites, an increased number of synapses, and reinstated learning behaviour and access to long-term memories. These data suggest that inhibition of histone deacetylases might be a suitable therapeutic avenue for neurodegenerative diseases associated with learning and memory impairment, and raises the possibility of recovery of long-term memories in patients with dementia.","MIT, Picower Inst Learning & Memory, Dept Brain & Cognit Sci, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; Howard Hughes Med Inst, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; Riken MIT Neurosci Res Ctr, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA","Tsai, LH (reprint author), MIT, Picower Inst Learning & Memory, Dept Brain & Cognit Sci, Vassar St,Bldg 46, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",andre.fischer@mpi-mail.mpg.de; lhtsai@mit.edu,,,,,,29,669,701,6,82,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,10-May,2007,447,7141,,,,,178,U2,,10.1038/nature05772,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,165WT,WOS:000246338700036,17468743,No,Y,N,11/20/17

By observing systems where the planet and star periodically eclipse each other, several groups have been able to estimate the temperatures of the daysides of these planets(1-3). A key question is whether the atmosphere is able to transport the energy incident upon the dayside to the nightside, which will determine the temperature at different points on the planet's surface. Here we report observations of HD 189733, the closest of these eclipsing planetary systems(4-6), over half an orbital period, from which we can construct a 'map' of the distribution of temperatures. We detected the increase in brightness as the dayside of the planet rotated into view. We estimate a minimum brightness temperature of 973 +/- 33 K and a maximum brightness temperature of 1,212 +/- 11K at a wavelength of 8 mm, indicating that energy from the irradiated dayside is efficiently redistributed throughout the atmosphere, in contrast to a recent claim for another hot Jupiter 7. Our data indicate that the peak hemisphereintegrated brightness occurs 16 +/- 6 degrees before opposition, corresponding to a hotspot shifted east of the substellar point. The secondary eclipse ( when the planet moves behind the star) occurs 120 +/- 24 s later than predicted, which may indicate a slightly eccentric orbit.","Harvard Smithsonian Ctr Astrophys, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; NASA, Ames Res Ctr, Space Sci & Astrobiol Div, Moffett Field, CA 94035 USA; SETI Inst, Mountain View, CA 94043 USA; Univ Washington, Dept Astron, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; Univ Arizona, Lunar & Planetary Lab, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA; Univ Arizona, Dept Planetary Sci, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA; Univ Toledo, Dept Phys & Astron, Toledo, OH 43606 USA","Knutson, HA (reprint author), Harvard Smithsonian Ctr Astrophys, 60 Garden St, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",hknutson@cfa.harvard.edu,"Agol, Eric/B-8775-2013","Agol, Eric/0000-0002-0802-9145; Cowan, Nicolas/0000-0001-6129-5699; Fortney, Jonathan/0000-0002-9843-4354; Charbonneau, David/0000-0002-9003-484X",,,,30,423,428,0,8,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,10-May,2007,447,7141,,,,,183,186,,10.1038/nature05782,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,165WT,WOS:000246338700037,17495920,No,Y,N,11/20/17

Superconductivity at ambient pressure in lithium has hitherto remained unresolved, both theoretically and experimentally(11-16). Here we demonstrate that lithium is a superconductor at ambient pressure with a transition temperature of 0.4 mK. As lithium has a particularly simple conduction electron system, it represents an important case for any attempts to classify superconductors and transition temperatures, especially to determine if any non-magnetic configuration can exclude superconductivity down to zero temperature.

In condensed matter, magnetic materials can also display single-handed, or homochiral, spin structures. This may be caused by the Dzyaloshinskii - Moriya interaction, which arises from spin - orbit scattering of electrons in an inversion-asymmetric crystal field(3,4). This effect is typically irrelevant in bulk metals as their crystals are inversion symmetric. However, low-dimensional systems lack structural inversion symmetry, so that homochiral spin structures may occur(5). Here we report the observation of magnetic order of a specific chirality in a single atomic layer of manganese on a tungsten ( 110) substrate. Spin-polarized scanning tunnelling microscopy reveals that adjacent spins are not perfectly antiferromagnetic but slightly canted, resulting in a spin spiral structure with a period of about 12 nm. We show by quantitative theory that this chiral order is caused by the Dzyaloshinskii - Moriya interaction and leads to a left-rotating spin cycloid. Our findings confirm the significance of this interaction for magnets in reduced dimensions. Chirality in nanoscale magnets may play a crucial role in spintronic devices, where the spin rather than the charge of an electron is used for data transmission and manipulation. For instance, a spin-polarized current flowing through chiral magnetic structures will exert a spin-torque on the magnetic structure(6,7), causing a variety of excitations or manipulations of the magnetization(8,9) and giving rise to microwave emission, magnetization switching, or magnetic motors.","Univ Hamburg, Inst Appl Phys, D-20355 Hamburg, Germany; Univ Hamburg, Microstruct Res Ctr, D-20355 Hamburg, Germany; Forschungszentrum Julich, Inst Festkorperforsch, D-52425 Julich, Germany","Bode, M (reprint author), Argonne Natl Lab, Ctr Nanoscale Mat, 9700 S Cass Ave, Argonne, IL 60439 USA.",mbode@anl.gov,"Bihlmayer, Gustav/G-5279-2013; Blugel, Stefan/J-8323-2013; Wiesendanger, Roland/P-9726-2016; Bode, Matthias/S-3249-2016; von Bergmann, Kirsten/S-5696-2016","Bihlmayer, Gustav/0000-0002-6615-1122; Blugel, Stefan/0000-0001-9987-4733; Wiesendanger, Roland/0000-0002-0472-4183; Bode, Matthias/0000-0001-7514-5560; von Bergmann, Kirsten/0000-0002-4514-3254",,,,27,388,389,21,199,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,10-May,2007,447,7141,,,,,190,193,,10.1038/nature05802,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,165WT,WOS:000246338700039,17495922,No,Y,N,11/20/17

Mixing processes in the Antarctic Circumpolar Current are key to this circulation, because they control the rate at which water sinking at high latitudes returns to the surface in the Southern Ocean(3-8). Yet estimates of the rates of these processes and of the upwelling that they induce are poorly constrained by observations. Here we take advantage of a natural tracer-release experiment - an injection of mantle helium from hydrothermal vents into the Circumpolar Current near Drake Passage(9) - to measure the rates of mixing and upwelling in the current's intermediate layers over a sector that spans nearly one-tenth of its circumpolar path. Dispersion of the tracer reveals rapid upwelling along density surfaces and intense mixing across density surfaces, both occurring at rates that are an order of magnitude greater than rates implicit in models of the average Southern Ocean overturning(4-8). These findings support the view that deep-water pathways along and across density surfaces intensify and intertwine as the Antarctic Circumpolar Current flows over complex ocean-floor topography, giving rise to a short circuit of the overturning circulation in these regions.","Natl Oceanog Ctr, Sch Ocean & Earth Sci, Southampton SO14 3ZH, Hants, England; Univ E Anglia, Sch Math, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England; Univ E Anglia, Sch Environm Sci, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England; Univ Bremen, Inst Umweltphys, D-28334 Bremen, Germany","Garabato, ACN (reprint author), Natl Oceanog Ctr, Sch Ocean & Earth Sci, Southampton SO14 3ZH, Hants, England.",acng@noc.soton.ac.uk,"Stevens, David/F-2509-2010","Stevens, David/0000-0002-7283-4405; Watson, Andrew/0000-0002-9654-8147",,,,32,49,50,2,22,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,10-May,2007,447,7141,,,,,194,197,,10.1038/nature05832,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,165WT,WOS:000246338700040,17495923,No,,,11/20/17

Its presence reflects dynamic processes related to formation of the lithosphere as well as to present-day tectonic motions. A powerful tool for detecting and characterizing upper-mantle anisotropy is the analysis of shear-wave splitting measurements. Because of the poor vertical resolution afforded by this type of data, however, it has remained controversial whether the splitting has a lithospheric origin that is 'frozen-in' at the time of formation of the craton(3), or whether the anisotropy originates primarily in the asthenosphere, and is induced by shear owing to present-day absolute plate motions(4). In addition, predictions from surface-wave-derived models are largely incompatible with shear-wave splitting observations(5,6). Here we show that this disagreement can be resolved by simultaneously inverting surface waveforms and shear-wave splitting data. We present evidence for the presence of two layers of anisotropy with different fast-axis orientations in the cratonic part of the North American upper mantle. At asthenospheric depths ( 200 - 400 km) the fast axis is sub-parallel to the absolute plate motion, confirming the presence of shear related to current tectonic processes, whereas in the lithosphere ( 80 - 200 km), the orientation is significantly more northerly. In the western, tectonically active, part of North America, the fast-axis direction is consistent with the absolute plate motion throughout the depth range considered, in agreement with a much thinner lithosphere.","Berkeley Seismol Lab, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA","Romanowicz, B (reprint author), Berkeley Seismol Lab, 209 McCone Hall, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",barbara@seismo.berkeley.edu,"Marone, Federica/J-4420-2013; Romanowicz, barbara/H-6726-2017","Romanowicz, barbara/0000-0002-6208-6044",,,,39,89,91,1,11,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,10-May,2007,447,7141,,,,,198,U4,,10.1038/nature05742,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,165WT,WOS:000246338700041,17495924,No,,,11/20/17

It is surprising, then, that such a pervasive source of biological diversity has not been integrated into studies of adaptive radiation, despite extensive and growing attention to both phenomena(1,3-7). Rather, most studies of adaptive radiation either group individuals without regard to sex or focus solely on one sex. Here we show that sexual differences contribute substantially to the ecomorphological diversity produced by the adaptive radiations of West Indian Anolis lizards: within anole species, males and females occupy mostly non-overlapping parts of morphological space; the overall extent of sexual variation is large relative to interspecific variation; and the degree of variation depends on ecological type. Thus, when sexual dimorphism in ecologically relevant traits is substantial, ignoring its contribution may significantly underestimate the adaptive component of evolutionary radiation. Conversely, if sexual dimorphism and interspecific divergence are alternative means of ecological diversification, then the degree of sexual dimorphism may be negatively related to the extent of adaptive radiation.","Univ Hawaii Manoa, Dept Zool, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; Washington Univ, Dept Biol, St Louis, MO 63130 USA; Washington Univ, Dept Math, St Louis, MO 63130 USA","Butler, MA (reprint author), Univ Hawaii Manoa, Dept Zool, 2538 McCarthy Mall, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA.",mbutler@hawaii.edu,"Butler, Marguerite/B-6700-2011","Butler, Marguerite/0000-0002-2039-5965",,,,30,103,111,6,58,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,10-May,2007,447,7141,,,,,202,205,,10.1038/nature05774,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,165WT,WOS:000246338700042,17495925,No,,,11/20/17

Properties such as colour or glossiness can help us decide whether a pancake is cooked, or a patch of pavement is icy. Most studies of surface appearance have emphasized textureless matte surfaces(1-3), but real-world surfaces, which may have gloss and complex mesostructure, are now receiving increased attention(4-7). Their appearance results from a complex interplay of illumination, reflectance and surface geometry, which are difficult to tease apart given an image. If there were simple image statistics that were diagnostic of surface properties it would be sensible to use them(8-11). Here we show that the skewness of the luminance histogram and the skewness of sub-band filter outputs are correlated with surface gloss and inversely correlated with surface albedo ( diffuse reflectance). We find evidence that human observers use skewness, or a similar measure of histogram asymmetry, in making judgements about surfaces. When the image of a surface has positively skewed statistics, it tends to appear darker and glossier than a similar surface with lower skewness, and this is true whether the skewness is inherent to the original image or is introduced by digital manipulation. We also find a visual aftereffect based on skewness: adaptation to patterns with skewed statistics can alter the apparent lightness and glossiness of surfaces that are subsequently viewed. We suggest that there are neural mechanisms sensitive to skewed statistics, and that their outputs can be used in estimating surface properties.","NTT Corp, Human & Informat Sci Lab, NTT Commun Sci Labs, Atsugi, Kanagawa 2430198, Japan; MIT, Dept Brain & Cognit Sci, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; MIT, Comp Sci & Artificial Intelligence Lab, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA","Motoyoshi, I (reprint author), NTT Corp, Human & Informat Sci Lab, NTT Commun Sci Labs, 3-1 Morinosato, Atsugi, Kanagawa 2430198, Japan.",motoyosi@apollo3.brl.ntt.co.jp,,,,,,25,252,252,2,49,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,10-May,2007,447,7141,,,,,206,209,,10.1038/nature05724,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,165WT,WOS:000246338700043,17443193,No,,,11/20/17

Genetic polymorphisms are constantly arising through mutation, and although most are promptly eliminated(3), polymorphisms in functionally important traits are common. One mechanism that can maintain polymorphisms is negative frequency-dependent selection on alternative alleles, whereby the fitness of each decreases as its frequency increases(4,5). Examples of frequency-dependent selection are rare, especially when attempting to describe the genetic basis of the phenotype under selection. Here we show frequency-dependent selection in a well-known natural genetic polymorphism affecting fruitfly foraging behaviour. When raised in low nutrient conditions, both of the naturally occurring alleles of the foraging gene (for(s) and for(R)) have their highest fitness when rare - the hallmark of negative frequency-dependent selection. This effect disappears at higher resources levels, demonstrating the role of larval competition. We are able to confirm the involvement of the foraging gene by showing that a sitter-like mutant allele on a rover background has similar frequency-dependent fitness as the natural sitter allele. Our study represents a clear demonstration of frequency-dependent selection, and we are able to attribute this effect to a single, naturally polymorphic gene known to affect behaviour.","Univ Toronto, Dept Biol, Mississauga, ON L5L 1C6, Canada; Univ Toronto, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Toronto, ON M5S 3G5, Canada","Sokolowski, MB (reprint author), Univ Toronto, Dept Biol, Mississauga, ON L5L 1C6, Canada.",msokolow@utm.utoronto.ca,"Fitzpatrick, Mark/A-3414-2008; Allen, John/B-5510-2008",,,,,29,101,106,1,91,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,10-May,2007,447,7141,,,,,210,U5,,10.1038/nature05764,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,165WT,WOS:000246338700044,17495926,No,,,11/20/17

In the Arabidopsis thaliana root epidermis, expression of the homeobox GLABRA2 (GL2) gene determines hair/non-hair cell fate(6,7). This requires signalling of positional information from the underlying cortical layer(8,9), complex transcriptional regulation(10,11) and a change in chromatin accessibility(12). However, the molecular connections among these factors and with cell division are not known. Here we have identified a GL2-expression modulator, GEM, as an interactor of CDT1, a DNA replication protein. GEM also interacts with TTG1 ( TRANSPARENT TESTA GLABRA1), a WD40-repeat protein involved in GL2-dependent cell fate decision, and modulates both cell division and GL2 expression. Here we show that GEM participates in the maintenance of the repressor histone H3K9 methylation status of root patterning genes, providing a link between cell division, fate and differentiation during Arabidopsis root development.","Univ Autonoma Madrid, CSIC, Ctr Biol Mol Severo Ochoa, E-28049 Madrid, Spain","Gutierrez, C (reprint author), Univ Autonoma Madrid, CSIC, Ctr Biol Mol Severo Ochoa, E-28049 Madrid, Spain.",cgutierrez@cbm.uam.es,"Caro, Elena/A-8097-2011; castellano, mar/L-2063-2014; Caro, Elena/G-6352-2012","castellano, mar/0000-0003-0339-4247; Gutierrez, Crisanto/0000-0001-8905-8222; ",,,,34,86,96,1,22,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,10-May,2007,447,7141,,,,,213,U6,,10.1038/nature05763,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,165WT,WOS:000246338700045,17450124,No,,,11/20/17

The functional interaction between the MRE11 complex and ATM has been proposed to require a conserved C-terminal domain of NBS1 for recruitment of ATM to sites of DNA damage(4,5). Human Nijmegen breakage syndrome (NBS) cells and those derived from multiple mouse models of NBS express a hypomorphic NBS1 allele that exhibits impaired ATM activity despite having an intact C-terminal domain(3,6-11). This indicates that the NBS1 C terminus is not sufficient for ATM function. We derived Nbs1(Delta C/Delta C) mice in which the C-terminal ATM interaction domain is deleted. Nbs1(Delta C/Delta C) cells exhibit intra-S-phase checkpoint defects, but are otherwise indistinguishable from wild-type cells with respect to other checkpoint functions, ionizing radiation sensitivity and chromosome stability. However, multiple tissues of Nbs1(Delta C/Delta C) mice showed a severe apoptotic defect, comparable to that of ATM- or CHK2-deficient animals. Analysis of p53 transcriptional targets and ATM substrates showed that, in contrast to the phenotype of Chk2(-/-) mice, NBS1(Delta C) does not impair the induction of proapoptotic genes. Instead, the defects observed in Nbs1(Delta C/Delta C) result from impaired phosphorylation of ATM targets including SMC1 and the proapoptotic factor, BID.","Sloan Kettering Inst, New York, NY 10021 USA; Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, New York, NY 10021 USA; Weill Cornell Grad Sch Med Sci, New York, NY 10021 USA","Petrini, JHJ (reprint author), Sloan Kettering Inst, New York, NY 10021 USA.",petrinij@mskcc.org,"Stracker, Travis/I-2815-2015","Stracker, Travis/0000-0002-8650-2081; Petrini, John/0000-0001-5102-5679","NIGMS NIH HHS [R01 GM056888-08, R01 GM056888, R01 GM056888-09, R01 GM059413, R01 GM059413-08]",,,29,84,88,0,2,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,10-May,2007,447,7141,,,,,218,U7,,10.1038/nature05740,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,165WT,WOS:000246338700046,17429352,No,,,11/20/17

In contrast to siRNA and microRNA duplexes generated endogenously by the RNaseIII endonuclease Dicer(2), synthetic siRNAs display a 5' OH group. However, to become incorporated into the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) and mediate target RNA cleavage, the guide strand of an siRNA needs to display a phosphate group at the 5' end(3-5). The identity of the responsible kinase has so far remained elusive. Monitoring siRNA phosphorylation, we applied a chromatographic approach that resulted in the identification of the protein hClp1 ( human Clp1), a known component of both transfer RNA splicing(6) and messenger RNA 3'-end formation(7) machineries. Here we report that the kinase hClp1 phosphorylates and licenses synthetic siRNAs to become assembled into RISC for subsequent target RNA cleavage. More importantly, we reveal the physiological role of hClp1 as the RNA kinase that phosphorylates the 5' end of the 3' exon during human tRNA splicing(8), allowing the subsequent ligation of both exon halves by an unknown tRNA ligase. The investigation of this novel enzymatic activity of hClp1 in the context of mRNA 3'-end formation, where no RNA phosphorylation event has hitherto been predicted, remains a challenge for the future.","Austrian Acad Sci, Inst Mol Biotechnol, A-1030 Vienna, Austria","Martinez, J (reprint author), Austrian Acad Sci, Inst Mol Biotechnol, Dr Bohr Gasse 3, A-1030 Vienna, Austria.",javier.martinez@imba.oeaw.ac.at,,,,,,27,102,106,0,3,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,10-May,2007,447,7141,,,,,222,U8,,10.1038/nature05777,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,165WT,WOS:000246338700047,17495927,No,,,11/20/17

Here we present a new model of kimberlite ascent and eruption, emphasizing the extremely unsteady nature of this process to resolve many of the seemingly contradictory characteristics of kimberlites and diatremes. Dyke initiation in a deep CO2-rich source region in the mantle leads to rapid propagation of the dyke tip, below which CO2 fluid collects, with a zone of magmatic foam beneath. When the tip breaks the surface of the ground, gas release causes a depressurization wave to travel into the magma. This wave implodes the dyke walls, fragments the magma, and creates a `ringing' fluidization wave. Together, these processes form the diatreme. Catastrophic magma chilling seals the dyke. No precursor to the eruption is felt at the surface and the processes are complete in about an hour.","Brown Univ, Dept Geol Sci, Providence, RI 02912 USA; Univ Lancaster, Dept Environm Sci, Lancaster LA1 4YQ, England","Head, JW (reprint author), Brown Univ, Dept Geol Sci, Providence, RI 02912 USA.",james_head@brown.edu,,,,,,37,90,91,3,31,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,3-May,2007,447,7140,,,,,53,57,,10.1038/nature05692,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,163GY,WOS:000246149300041,17476260,No,,,11/20/17

These models have been mainly supported by the observed presence of large concentrations of hydrogen detected by the Gamma Ray Spectrometer suite of instruments on the Mars Odyssey spacecraft(8-10). The models and measurements are consistent with a water-ice table that steadily increases in depth with decreasing latitude. More detailed modelling has predicted that the depth at which water ice is stable can be highly variable, owing to local surface heterogeneities such as rocks and slopes, and the thermal inertia of the ground cover(11-13). Measurements have, however, been limited to the footprint ( several hundred kilometres) of the Gamma Ray Spectrometer suite, preventing the observations from documenting more detailed water-ice distributions. Here I show that by observing the seasonal temperature response of the martian surface with the Thermal Emission Imaging System on the Mars Odyssey spacecraft(14), it is possible to observe such heterogeneities at subkilometre scale. These observations show significant regional and local water-ice depth variability, and, in some cases, support distributions in the subsurface predicted by atmospheric exchange and vapour diffusion models. The presence of water ice where it follows the depth of stability under current climatic conditions implies an active martian water cycle that responds to orbit-driven climate cycles(15-17). Several regions also have apparent deviations from the theoretical stability level, indicating that additional factors influence the ice-table depth. The high-resolution measurements show that the depth to the water-ice table is highly variable within the potential Phoenix spacecraft landing ellipses, and is likely to be variable at scales that may be sampled by the spacecraft.","Arizona State Univ, Sch Earth & Space Explorat, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA","Bandfield, JL (reprint author), Arizona State Univ, Sch Earth & Space Explorat, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA.",joshband@asu.edu,,"Bandfield, Joshua/0000-0003-3571-3716",,,,29,60,61,0,8,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,3-May,2007,447,7140,,,,,64,U1,,10.1038/nature05781,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,163GY,WOS:000246149300043,17476262,No,,,11/20/17

Antiferromagnets, which carry no net external magnetic dipole moment, yet have a periodic arrangement of the electron spins extending over macroscopic distances, should also display magnetic noise. However, this must be sampled at spatial wavelengths of the order of several interatomic spacings, rather than the macroscopic scales characteristic of ferromagnets. Here we present a direct measurement of the fluctuations in the nanometre-scale superstructure of spin- and charge-density waves associated with antiferromagnetism in elemental chromium. The technique used is X-ray photon correlation spectroscopy, where coherent X-ray diffraction produces a speckle pattern that serves as a 'fingerprint' of a particular magnetic domain configuration. The temporal evolution of the patterns corresponds to domain walls advancing and retreating over micrometre distances. This work demonstrates a useful measurement tool for antiferromagnetic domain wall engineering, but also reveals a fundamental finding about spin dynamics in the simplest antiferromagnet: although the domain wall motion is thermally activated at temperatures above 100 K, it is not so at lower temperatures, and indeed has a rate that saturates at a finite value - consistent with quantum fluctuations - on cooling below 40 K.","Argonne Natl Lab, Ctr Nanoscale Mat, Adv Photon Source, Argonne, IL 60439 USA; Univ Chicago, James Franck Inst, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; Univ Chicago, Dept Phys, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; UCL, London Ctr Nanotechnol, London WC1E 6BT, England; UCL, Dept Phys & Astron, London WC1E 6BT, England","Shpyrko, OG (reprint author), Argonne Natl Lab, Ctr Nanoscale Mat, Adv Photon Source, 9700 S Cass Ave, Argonne, IL 60439 USA.",oshpyrko@anl.gov,"Shpyrko, Oleg/J-3970-2012; Feng, Yejun/A-5417-2009","Feng, Yejun/0000-0003-3667-056X; , /0000-0003-3116-6719; Logan, Jonathan/0000-0003-2554-9457",,,,29,89,91,3,74,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,3-May,2007,447,7140,,,,,68,71,,10.1038/nature05776,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,163GY,WOS:000246149300044,17476263,No,,,11/20/17

All three behave according to their respective positions in groups 6, 7 and 8 of the periodic table, which arranges elements according to their outermost electrons and hence their chemical properties. However, the chemical characterization results are not trivial: relativistic effects on the electronic structure of the heaviest elements can strongly influence chemical properties(4-6). The next heavy element targeted for chemical characterization is element 112; its closed-shell electronic structure with a filled outer s orbital suggests that it may be particularly susceptible to strong deviations from the chemical property trends expected within group 12. Indeed, first experiments concluded that element 112 does not behave like its lighter homologue mercury(7-9). However, the production and identification methods(10,11) used cast doubt on the validity of this result. Here we report a more reliable chemical characterization of element 112, involving the production of two atoms of (283)112 through the alpha decay of the short-lived (287)114 ( which itself forms in the nuclear fusion reaction 12 of Ca-48 with Pu-242) and the adsorption of the two atoms on a gold surface. By directly comparing the adsorption characteristics of (283)112 to that of mercury and the noble gas radon, we find that element 112 is very volatile and, unlike radon, reveals a metallic interaction with the gold surface. These adsorption characteristics establish element 112 as a typical element of group 12, and its successful production unambiguously establishes the approach to the island of stability of superheavy elements through Ca-48-induced nuclear fusion reactions with actinides.","Paul Scherrer Inst, CH-5232 Villigen, Switzerland; Univ Bern, Dept Chem & Biochem, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland; Joint Inst Nucl Res, Flerov Lab Nucl React, Dubna 141980, Russia; Inst Electr Mat Technol, PL-02668 Warsaw, Poland","Eichler, R (reprint author), Paul Scherrer Inst, CH-5232 Villigen, Switzerland.",robert.eichler@psi.ch,"Eichler, Robert/G-5130-2011; Svirikhin, Alexandr/R-7801-2017; Yeremin, Alexander/R-9458-2017","Svirikhin, Alexandr/0000-0002-4033-7076; ",,,,31,185,187,1,33,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,3-May,2007,447,7140,,,,,72,75,,10.1038/nature05761,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,163GY,WOS:000246149300045,17476264,No,,,11/20/17

Each of these has been demonstrated to arise from shear slip, just as do regular earthquakes, but with longer characteristic durations and radiating much less seismic energy. Here we show that these slow events follow a simple, unified scaling relationship that clearly differentiates their behaviour from that of regular earthquakes. We find that their seismic moment is proportional to the characteristic duration and their moment rate function is constant, with a spectral high-frequency decay of f(-1). This scaling and spectral behaviour demonstrates that they can be thought of as different manifestations of the same phenomena and that they comprise a new earthquake category. The observed scale dependence of rupture velocity for these events can be explained by either a constant low-stress drop model or a diffusional constant-slip model. This new scaling law unifies a diverse class of slow seismic events and may lead to a better understanding of the plate subduction process and large earthquake generation.","Univ Tokyo, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo 1130033, Japan; Stanford Univ, Dept Geophys, Stanford, CA 94305 USA","Ide, S (reprint author), Univ Tokyo, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, Bunkyo Ku, Hongo 7-3-1, Tokyo 1130033, Japan.",ide@eps.s.u-tokyo.ac.jp,"Uchide, Takahiko/D-2093-2009; IDE, SATOSHI/G-4887-2014","Uchide, Takahiko/0000-0001-5106-1186; ",,,,31,261,270,7,47,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,3-May,2007,447,7140,,,,,76,79,,10.1038/nature05780,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,163GY,WOS:000246149300046,17476265,No,Y,N,11/20/17

Efforts to evaluate proposed mechanisms have been hampered by a lack of comparative data on species' reactions to relevant axes of environmental variation(1). Here we show that differential drought sensitivity shapes plant distributions in tropical forests at both regional and local scales. Our analyses are based on experimental field assessments of drought sensitivity of 48 species of trees and shrubs, and on their local and regional distributions within a network of 122 inventory sites spanning a rainfall gradient across the Isthmus of Panama. Our results suggest that niche differentiation with respect to soil water availability is a direct determinant of both local- and regional-scale distributions of tropical trees. Changes in soil moisture availability caused by global climate change and forest fragmentation are therefore likely to alter tropical species distributions, community composition and diversity.","Smithsonian Trop Res Inst, Balboa 03092, Panama; Univ Kaiserslautern, Dept Plant Ecol & Systemat, D-67663 Kaiserslautern, Germany; Univ Georgia, Dept Plant Biol, Athens, GA 30602 USA; Univ Utah, Dept Biol, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA; US Forest Serv, USDA, Burlington, VT 05402 USA; Univ Alberta, Dept Renewable Resources, Edmonton, AB T6G 2E3, Canada","Engelbrecht, BMJ (reprint author), Smithsonian Trop Res Inst, Apartado 0843, Balboa 03092, Panama.",engelbrb@si.edu,"Turner, Benjamin/E-5940-2011; Engelbrecht, Bettina/E-9914-2012","Turner, Benjamin/0000-0002-6585-0722; Comita, Liza/0000-0002-9169-1331",,,,30,418,446,20,326,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,3-May,2007,447,7140,,,,,80,U2,,10.1038/nature05747,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,163GY,WOS:000246149300047,17476266,No,Y,N,11/20/17

However, most of the brain's energy consumption is devoted to ongoing metabolic activity not clearly associated with any particular stimulus or behaviour(1). Functional magnetic resonance imaging studies in humans aimed at understanding this ongoing activity have shown that spontaneous fluctuations of the blood-oxygen-level-dependent signal occur continuously in the resting state. In humans, these fluctuations are temporally coherent within widely distributed cortical systems that recapitulate the functional architecture of responses evoked by experimentally administered tasks(2-6\). Here, we show that the same phenomenon is present in anaesthetized monkeys even at anaesthetic levels known to induce profound loss of consciousness. We specifically demonstrate coherent spontaneous fluctuations within three well known systems ( oculomotor, somatomotor and visual) and the 'default' system, a set of brain regions thought by some to support uniquely human capabilities. Our results indicate that coherent system fluctuations probably reflect an evolutionarily conserved aspect of brain functional organization that transcends levels of consciousness.","Washington Univ, Dept Radiol, St Louis, MO 63110 USA; Washington Univ, Dept Neurol, St Louis, MO 63110 USA; Washington Univ, Dept Anat & Neurobiol, St Louis, MO 63110 USA; Washington Univ, Dept Biomed Engn, St Louis, MO 63110 USA; Harvard Univ, Dept Psychol, Ctr Brain Sci, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Athinoula A Martinos Ctr Biomed Imaging, Charlestown, MA 02129 USA","Raichle, ME (reprint author), Washington Univ, Dept Radiol, St Louis, MO 63110 USA.",marc@npg.wustl.edu,"Vincent, Justin/B-5033-2012; Snyder, Lawrence/A-4593-2017",,,,,33,921,940,0,63,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,3-May,2007,447,7140,,,,,83,U4,,10.1038/nature05758,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,163GY,WOS:000246149300048,17476267,No,Y,N,11/20/17

Studies on nonsense-mediated cystic fibrosis have indicated that boosting specific protein synthesis from < 1% to as little as 5% of normal levels may greatly reduce the severity or eliminate the principal manifestations of disease(2,3). To address the need for a drug capable of suppressing premature termination, we identified PTC124 - a new chemical entity that selectively induces ribosomal readthrough of premature but not normal termination codons. PTC124 activity, optimized using nonsense-containing reporters, promoted dystrophin production in primary muscle cells from humans and mdx mice expressing dystrophin nonsense alleles, and rescued striated muscle function in mdx mice within 2 - 8 weeks of drug exposure. PTC124 was well tolerated in animals at plasma exposures substantially in excess of those required for nonsense suppression. The selectivity of PTC124 for premature termination codons, its well characterized activity profile, oral bioavailability and pharmacological properties indicate that this drug may have broad clinical potential for the treatment of a large group of genetic disorders with limited or no therapeutic options.","PTC Therapeut, South Plainfield, NJ 07080 USA; Univ Penn, Sch Med, Dept Physiol, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; Univ Massachusetts, Sch Med, Dept Mol Genet & Microbiol, Worcester, MA 01655 USA","Peltz, SW (reprint author), PTC Therapeut, 100 Corp Court, South Plainfield, NJ 07080 USA.",speltz@ptcbio.com,"Sweeney, H Lee/F-1862-2010",,NICHD NIH HHS [R42 HD048137]; NIGMS NIH HHS [R37 GM027757],,,35,554,576,4,63,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,3-May,2007,447,7140,,,,,87,U6,,10.1038/nature05756,,7,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,163GY,WOS:000246149300049,17450125,No,,,11/20/17

Tissue macrophages assume a distinct phenotype, designated alternatively activated macrophages(2). Relatively little is known about the factors that trigger these host responses. Chitin, a widespread environmental biopolymer of N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosamine, provides structural rigidity to fungi, crustaceans, helminths and insects(3). Here, we show that chitin induces the accumulation in tissue of IL-4- expressing innate immune cells, including eosinophils and basophils, when given to mice. Tissue infiltration was unaffected by the absence of Toll-like-receptor-mediated lipopolysaccharide recognition but did not occur if the injected chitin was pre-treated with the IL-4- and IL-13-inducible mammalian chitinase, AMCase(4), or if the chitin was injected into mice that overexpressed AMCase. Chitin mediated alternative macrophage activation in vivo and the production of leukotriene B-4, which was required for optimal immune cell recruitment. Chitin is a recognition element for tissue infiltration by innate cells implicated in allergic and helminth immunity and this process can be negatively regulated by a vertebrate chitinase.","Univ Calif San Francisco, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Dept Med, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; Univ Calif San Francisco, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Dept Immunol Microbiol, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Div Rheumatol Allergy & Immunol, Ctr Immunol & Inflammatory Dis, Charlestown, MA 02129 USA; Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Charlestown, MA 02129 USA; Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Dept Mol Cell Biol, NL-1091 BT Amsterdam, Netherlands","Locksley, RM (reprint author), Univ Calif San Francisco, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Dept Med, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA.",locksley@medicine.ucsf.edu,,,"NIAID NIH HHS [R01 AI026918, R01 AI030663, R37 AI026918, R37 AI026918-20]",,,31,419,434,6,60,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,3-May,2007,447,7140,,,,,92,U7,,10.1038/nature05746,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,163GY,WOS:000246149300050,17450126,No,Y,N,11/20/17

Human diseases that disable ciliary flow, such as primary ciliary dyskinesia, can compromise organ function or the ability to resist pathogens, resulting in recurring respiratory infections, otitis, hydrocephaly and infertility(3). To create a ciliary flow, the cilia within each cell need to be polarized coordinately along the planar axis of the epithelium, but how polarity is established in any ciliated epithelia is not known. Here we analyse the developmental mechanisms that polarize cilia, using the ciliated cells in the developing Xenopus larval skin as a model system(4). We show that cilia acquire polarity through a sequence of events, beginning with a polar bias set by tissue patterning, followed by a refinement phase. Our results indicate that during refinement, fluid flow is both necessary and sufficient in determining cilia polarity. These findings reveal a novel mechanism in which tissue patterning coupled with fluid flow act in a positive feedback loop to direct the planar polarity of cilia.","Salk Inst Biol Studies, San Diego, CA 92186 USA; Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Bioengn, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; Univ Calif San Diego, Whitehead Inst Biomed Engn, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA","Kintner, C (reprint author), Salk Inst Biol Studies, San Diego, CA 92186 USA.",kintner@salk.edu,,"Mitchell, Brian/0000-0001-6281-1536",,,,21,138,140,0,5,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,3-May,2007,447,7140,,,,,97,U8,,10.1038/nature05771,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,163GY,WOS:000246149300051,17450123,No,,,11/20/17

Repair of DSBs by homologous recombination generally occurs by gene conversion resulting from transfer of information from an intact donor duplex to both ends of the break site of the broken chromosome(1). In mitotic cells, gene conversion is rarely associated with reciprocal exchange and thus limits loss of heterozygosity for markers downstream of the site of repair and restricts potentially deleterious chromosome rearrangements(2-5). DSBs that arise by replication fork collapse or by erosion of uncapped telomeres have only one free end and are thought to repair by strand invasion into a homologous duplex DNA followed by replication to the chromosome end (break-induced replication, BIR)(6). BIR from one of the two ends of a DSB would result in loss of heterozygosity, suggesting that BIR is suppressed when DSBs have two ends so that repair occurs by the more conservative gene conversion mechanism. Here we show that BIR can occur by several rounds of strand invasion, DNA synthesis and dissociation. We further show that chromosome rearrangements can occur during BIR if dissociation and reinvasion occur within dispersed repeated sequences. This dynamic process could function to promote gene conversion by capture of the displaced invading strand at two-ended DSBs to prevent BIR.","Columbia Univ, Med Ctr, Dept Microbiol, New York, NY 10032 USA; Columbia Univ, Dept Biol Sci, New York, NY 10027 USA; Univ Paris 06, Inst Pasteur, UFR 927, F-75724 Paris, France; Inst Pasteur, CNRS, URA 2171, Unite Genet Mol Levures, F-75724 Paris 15, France","Symington, LS (reprint author), Columbia Univ, Med Ctr, Dept Microbiol, 701 W 169th St, New York, NY 10032 USA.",lss5@columbia.edu,"llorente, bertrand/M-3501-2016","Smith, Catherine/0000-0001-6779-8035","NIGMS NIH HHS [R01 GM041784, R01 GM041784-18, R01 GM041784-19]",,,26,173,175,1,15,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,3-May,2007,447,7140,,,,,102,105,,10.1038/nature05723,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,163GY,WOS:000246149300052,17410126,No,,,11/20/17

Here we present a technique that can provide such information. Using a 'Trp-cage' miniprotein known as TC5b ( ref. 5), we report photochemically induced dynamic nuclear polarization NMR6 pulse-labelling experiments that involve rapid in situ protein refolding(7,8). These experiments allow dipolar cross-relaxation with hyperpolarized aromatic side chain nuclei in the unfolded state to be identified and quantified in the resulting folded-state spectrum. We find that there is residual structure due to hydrophobic collapse in the unfolded state of this small protein, with strong inter-residue contacts between side chains that are relatively distant from one another in the native state.

Metals and ceramics commonly consist of space-filling arrays of single-crystal grains separated by a network of grain boundaries, and foams ( froths) are networks of gas-filled bubbles separated by liquid walls. Cellular structures also occur in biological tissue, and in magnetic, ferroelectric and complex fluid contexts. In many situations, the cell/grain/bubble walls move under the influence of their surface tension ( capillarity), with a velocity proportional to their mean curvature. As a result, the cells evolve and the structure coarsens. Over 50 years ago, von Neumann derived an exact formula for the growth rate of a cell in a two-dimensional cellular structure ( using the relation between wall velocity and mean curvature, the fact that three domain walls meet at 120 degrees and basic topology). This forms the basis of modern grain growth theory. Here we present an exact and much-sought extension of this result into three ( and higher) dimensions. The present results may lead to the development of predictive models for capillarity-driven microstructure evolution in a wide range of industrial and commercial processing scenarios - such as the heat treatment of metals, or even controlling the 'head' on a pint of beer.","Inst Adv Study, Sch Math, Princeton, NJ 08540 USA; Yeshiva Univ, Dept Phys, New York, NY 10033 USA","MacPherson, RD (reprint author), Inst Adv Study, Sch Math, Princeton, NJ 08540 USA.",rdm@math.ias.edu; srol@yu.edu,,,,,,22,155,158,2,88,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,26-Apr,2007,446,7139,,,,,1053,1055,,10.1038/nature05745,,3,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,160NU,WOS:000245950400043,17460667,No,,,11/20/17

Previously, samples as light as 7 zeptograms ( 1 zg = 10(-21) g) have been weighed in vacuum, and proton-level resolution seems to be within reach(8). Resolving small mass changes requires the resonator to be light and to ring at a very pure tone - that is, with a high quality factor(9). In solution, viscosity severely degrades both of these characteristics, thus preventing many applications in nanotechnology and the life sciences where fluid is required(10). Although the resonant structure can be designed to minimize viscous loss, resolution is still substantially degraded when compared to measurements made in air or vacuum(11-14). An entirely different approach eliminates viscous damping by placing the solution inside a hollow resonator that is surrounded by vacuum(15,16). Here we demonstrate that suspended microchannel resonators can weigh single nanoparticles, single bacterial cells and sub-monolayers of adsorbed proteins in water with sub-femtogram resolution ( 1 Hz bandwidth). Central to these results is our observation that viscous loss due to the fluid is negligible compared to the intrinsic damping of our silicon crystal resonator. The combination of the low resonator mass ( 100 ng) and high quality factor ( 15,000) enables an improvement in mass resolution of six orders of magnitude over a high-end commercial quartz crystal microbalance(17).

Iron thus plays an important role in the carbon cycle, and changes in its supply to the surface ocean may have had a significant effect on atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations over glacial - interglacial cycles(1-5). To date, the role of iron in carbon cycling has largely been assessed using short-term iron-addition experiments(6,7). It is difficult, however, to reliably assess the magnitude of carbon export to the ocean interior using such methods, and the short observational periods preclude extrapolation of the results to longer timescales(8). Here we report observations of a phytoplankton bloom induced by natural iron fertilization - an approach that offers the opportunity to overcome some of the limitations of short-term experiments. We found that a large phytoplankton bloom over the Kerguelen plateau in the Southern Ocean was sustained by the supply of iron and major nutrients to surface waters from iron-rich deep water below. The efficiency of fertilization, defined as the ratio of the carbon export to the amount of iron supplied, was at least ten times higher than previous estimates from short-term blooms induced by iron-addition experiments(7). This result sheds new light on the effect of long-term fertilization by iron and macronutrients on carbon sequestration, suggesting that changes in iron supply from below - as invoked in some palaeoclimatic(9,10) and future climate change scenarios(11) - may have a more significant effect on atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations than previously thought.","Univ Aix Marseille 2, Ctr Oceanol Marseille, Lab Oceanog & Biogeochim, F-13288 Marseille 09, France; CEN Saclay, IPSL, Lab Sci Climat & Environm, F-91191 Gif Sur Yvette, France; Antarct Climate & Ecosyst CRC, Hobart, Tas 7001, Australia; Univ Tasmania, Sch Chem, ACROSS, Hobart, Tas 7001, Australia; Univ Paris 06, CNRS, UMR 7159, LOCEAN IPSL, F-75252 Paris 5, France; Royal Netherlands Inst Sea Res, NL-1790 AB Den Burg, Texel, Netherlands; Univ Littoral Cote dOpale, FRE ELICO, MREN, F-62930 Wimereux, France; Museum Natl Hist Nat, USM402 LOCEAN, Dept Milieux & Peuplements Marins, F-75231 Paris 05, France; Fac Sci Luminy, Ctr Oceanol Marseille, F-13288 Marseille 09, France; CSIRO, Div Marine & Atmospher Res, Hobart, Tas 7001, Australia; CNRS, UMR 617, LMGEM, F-13288 Marseille 09, France; Technopole Brest Iroise, DT INSU CNRS, F-29280 Plouzane, France; Free Univ Brussels, Dept Analyt & Environm Chem, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium; Observ Midi Pyrenees, LEGOS, CNRS CNES IRD UPS, F-31400 Toulouse, France; Lab Oceanog Villefranche, F-06238 Villefranche Sur Mer, France; Univ Paris 06, CNRS, UMR7621, F-66650 Banyuls sur Mer, France; Technopole Brest Iroise, UMR 6539 LEMAR IUEM, F-29280 Plouzane, France; Univ Arcachon, Observ Aquitain Sci, UMR CNRS 5805 EPOC, Stn Marine Arcachon, F-33120 Arcachon, France; Univ Paris 07, UMP IPGP 7154, Lab Geochim Eaux, F-75251 Paris 05, France","Blain, S (reprint author), Univ Aix Marseille 2, Ctr Oceanol Marseille, Lab Oceanog & Biogeochim, Campus Luminy,Case 901, F-13288 Marseille 09, France.",stephane.blain@univmed.fr,"; Biblio, LOV/K-9251-2017; Queguiner, Bernard/B-4060-2008; Armand, Leanne/C-9004-2009; blain, stephane/F-6917-2010; Lo Monaco, Claire/E-1696-2012; Bowie, Andrew/C-8677-2013; Vincent, Dorothee/I-8109-2013; Trull, Tom/B-7028-2014; Jeandel, Catherine/P-3789-2014; Obernosterer, Ingrid/A-5434-2011; jacquet, stephanie/K-8678-2016","Viollier, Eric/0000-0002-8863-4563; bopp, laurent/0000-0003-4732-4953; Queguiner, Bernard/0000-0001-5020-8297; Armand, Leanne/0000-0003-3995-308X; blain, stephane/0000-0002-5234-2446; Bowie, Andrew/0000-0002-5144-7799; Jeandel, Catherine/0000-0002-4915-4719; ",,,,44,375,380,17,252,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,26-Apr,2007,446,7139,,,,,1070,U1,,10.1038/nature05700,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,160NU,WOS:000245950400047,17460670,No,Y,N,11/20/17

Such anomalous events have usually been explained in terms of the lower crust being cooler than normal(3,4). But if the lower crust is indeed cold enough to produce earthquakes, then the uppermost mantle beneath it should also be cold enough(2), and yet uppermost mantle earthquakes are not observed(5). Numerous lower-crustal earthquakes occur near the southwestern termination of the Taupo Volcanic Zone (TVZ), an active continental rift in New Zealand(6). Here we present three-dimensional tomographic imaging of seismic velocities and seismic attenuation in this region using data from a dense seismograph deployment(7). We find that crustal earthquakes accurately relocated with our three-dimensional seismic velocity model form a continuous band along the rift, deepening from mostly less than 10 km in the central TVZ to depths of 30 - 40 km in the lower crust, 30 km southwest of the termination of the volcanic zone. These earthquakes often occur in swarms, suggesting fluid movement in critically loaded fault zones(8). Seismic velocities within the band are also consistent with the presence of fluids, and the deepening seismicity parallels the boundary between high seismic attenuation ( interpreted as partial melt) within the central TVZ and low seismic attenuation in the crust to the southwest. This linking of upper and lower-crustal seismicity and crustal structure allows us to propose a common explanation for all the seismicity, involving the weakening of faults on the periphery of an otherwise dry, mafic crust by hot fluids, including those exsolved from underlying melt. Such fluids may generally be an important driver of lower-crustal seismicity near continental rifts.","GNS Sci, Lower Hutt 5040, New Zealand; Univ Calif Davis, Dept Geol, Davis, CA 95616 USA; Univ Leeds, Sch Earth & Environm, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England","Reyners, M (reprint author), GNS Sci, POB 30 368, Lower Hutt 5040, New Zealand.",m.reyners@gns.cri.nz,"Geophysical Equipment Facility, NERC/G-5260-2010",,,,,30,54,55,1,11,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,26-Apr,2007,446,7139,,,,,1075,1078,,10.1038/nature05743,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,160NU,WOS:000245950400048,17460671,No,,,11/20/17

Nutrient-rich habitats often experience more invasion than resource-poor habitats(1-4), a pattern consistent with traits generally associated with successful invaders ( high growth rates, early reproduction and many offspring(5-8)). However, invaders do colonize resource-poor environments, and the mechanisms that allow their success in these systems are poorly understood. Traits associated with resource conservation are widespread among species adapted to resource-poor environments(9-11), and invasive species may succeed in low-resource environments by employing resource conservation traits such as high resource-use efficiency ( RUE; carbon assimilation per unit of resource). We investigated RUE in invasive and native species from three habitats in Hawaii where light, water or nutrient availability was limiting to plant growth. Here we show that across multiple growth forms and broad taxonomic diversity invasive species were generally more efficient than native species at using limiting resources on short timescales and were similarly efficient when RUE measures were integrated over leaf lifespans. Our data challenge the idea that native species generally outperform invasive species under conditions of low resource availability(3), and suggest that managing resource levels is not always an effective strategy for invasive species control.","Stanford Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Stanford, CA 94305 USA","Funk, JL (reprint author), Stanford Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",funk@stanford.edu,"Funk, Jennifer/B-6328-2009",,,,,30,358,404,17,274,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,26-Apr,2007,446,7139,,,,,1079,1081,,10.1038/nature05719,,3,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,160NU,WOS:000245950400049,17460672,No,Y,N,11/20/17

That birds should adjust wing sweep to suit glide speed has been predicted qualitatively by analytical glide models(2,10), which extrapolated the wing's performance envelope from aerodynamic theory. Here we describe the aerodynamic and structural performance of actual swift wings, as measured in a wind tunnel, and on this basis build a semiempirical glide model. By measuring inside and outside swifts' behavioural envelope, we show that choosing the most suitable sweep can halve sink speed or triple turning rate. Extended wings are superior for slow glides and turns; swept wings are superior for fast glides and turns. This superiority is due to better aerodynamic performance - with the exception of fast turns. Swept wings are less effective at generating lift while turning at high speeds, but can bear the extreme loads. Finally, our glide model predicts that cost-effective gliding occurs at speeds of 8 - 10 m s(-1), whereas agility-related figures of merit peak at 15 - 25 m s(-1). In fact, swifts spend the night ('roost') in flight at 8 - 10 m s(-1) ( ref. 11), thus our model can explain this choice for a resting behaviour(11,12). Morphing not only adjusts birds' wing performance to the task at hand, but could also control the flight of future aircraft(7).","Univ Wageningen & Res Ctr, Expt Zool Grp, NL-6709 PG Wageningen, Netherlands; Leiden Univ, Inst Biol, NL-2300 RA Leiden, Netherlands; Lund Univ, Dept Theoret Ecol, SE-22362 Lund, Sweden; Delft Univ Technol, Dept Aerosp Engn, NL-2629 HS Delft, Netherlands; Univ Groningen, Dept Marine Biol, NL-9750 AA Haren, Netherlands","Lentink, D (reprint author), Univ Wageningen & Res Ctr, Expt Zool Grp, NL-6709 PG Wageningen, Netherlands.",david.lentink@wur.nl,"Hedenstrom, Anders/F-5377-2010; van Leeuwen, Johan/B-7897-2011; de Kat, Roeland/A-4874-2013","Hedenstrom, Anders/0000-0002-1757-0945; de Kat, Roeland/0000-0002-6851-4409",,,,30,75,84,6,77,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,26-Apr,2007,446,7139,,,,,1082,1085,,10.1038/nature05733,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,160NU,WOS:000245950400050,17460673,No,,,11/20/17

In contrast, there are few examples of synaptic plasticity of inhibitory GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid)-releasing synapses. Here we report long-term potentiation of GABA(A)-mediated synaptic transmission (LTPGABA) onto dopamine neurons of the rat brain ventral tegmental area, a region required for the development of drug addiction. This novel form of LTP is heterosynaptic, requiring postsynaptic NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) receptor activation at glutamate synapses, but resulting from increased GABA release at neighbouring inhibitory nerve terminals. NMDA receptor activation produces nitric oxide, a retrograde signal released from the postsynaptic dopamine neuron. Nitric oxide initiates LTPGABA by activating guanylate cyclase in GABA-releasing nerve terminals. Exposure to morphine both in vitro and in vivo prevents LTPGABA. Whereas brief treatment with morphine in vitro blocks LTPGABA by inhibiting presynaptic glutamate release, in vivo exposure to morphine persistently interrupts signalling from nitric oxide to guanylate cyclase. These neuroadaptations to opioid drugs might contribute to early stages of addiction, and may potentially be exploited therapeutically using drugs targeting GABA(A) receptors.","Brown Univ, Dept Mol Pharmacol Physiol & Biotechnol, Providence, RI 02912 USA","Kauer, JA (reprint author), Brown Univ, Dept Mol Pharmacol Physiol & Biotechnol, Providence, RI 02912 USA.",Julie_Kauer@brown.edu,,"Nugent, Fereshteh/0000-0002-8840-6923",,,,30,167,172,1,27,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,26-Apr,2007,446,7139,,,,,1086,1090,,10.1038/nature05726,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,160NU,WOS:000245950400051,17460674,No,,,11/20/17

When a neighbouring cell is injured, microglia move rapidly towards it or extend a process to engulf the injured cell. Because cells release or leak ATP when they are stimulated(1,2) or injured(3,4), extracellular nucleotides are thought to be involved in these events. In fact, ATP triggers a dynamic change in the motility of microglia in vitro(5,6) and in vivo(3,4), a previously unrecognized mechanism underlying microglial chemotaxis(5,6); in contrast, microglial phagocytosis has received only limited attention. Here we show that microglia express the metabotropic P2Y(6) receptor whose activation by endogenous agonist UDP triggers microglial phagocytosis. UDP facilitated the uptake of microspheres in a P2Y(6)-receptor-dependent manner, which was mimicked by the leakage of endogenous UDP when hippocampal neurons were damaged by kainic acid in vivo and in vitro. In addition, systemic administration of kainic acid in rats resulted in neuronal cell death in the hippocampal CA1 and CA3 regions, where increases in messenger RNA encoding P2Y(6) receptors that colocalized with activated microglia were observed. Thus, the P2Y(6) receptor is upregulated when neurons are damaged, and could function as a sensor for phagocytosis by sensing diffusible UDP signals, which is a previously unknown pathophysiological function of P2 receptors in microglia.","Kyushu Univ, Grad Sch Pharmaceut Sci, Dept Mol & Syst Pharmacol, Fukuoka 8128582, Japan; Natl Inst Hlth Sci, Div Pharmacol, Setagaya Ku, Tokyo 1588501, Japan; Univ Yamanashi, Interdisciplinary Grad Sch Med & Engn, Dept Pharmacol, Yamanashi 4093893, Japan; Natl Inst Neurosci, Dept Neurochem, Tokyo 1878502, Japan; NIDDKD, Mol Recognit Sect, Bioorgan Chem Lab, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA","Inoue, K (reprint author), Kyushu Univ, Grad Sch Pharmaceut Sci, Dept Mol & Syst Pharmacol, 3-1-1 Maidashi, Fukuoka 8128582, Japan.",inoue@phar.kyushu-u.ac.jp,"Jacobson, Kenneth/A-1530-2009; Shinozaki, Youichi/E-8594-2010","Jacobson, Kenneth/0000-0001-8104-1493; Shinozaki, Youichi/0000-0002-6448-1304",Intramural NIH HHS [Z01 DK031116-20],,,28,354,372,2,21,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,26-Apr,2007,446,7139,,,,,1091,1095,,10.1038/nature05704,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,160NU,WOS:000245950400052,17410128,No,Y,N,11/20/17

Recent studies indicate that Erp1/ Emi2, an inhibitor protein for the APC/C, has an essential role in establishing and maintaining CSF arrest(4-6), but its relationship to Mos, a mitogen-activated protein kinase ( MAPK) kinase kinase that also has an essential role in establishing CSF arrest 7 through activation of p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (p90rsk)(8,9), is unclear. Here we report that in Xenopus eggs Erp1 is a substrate of p90rsk, and that Mos-dependent phosphorylation of Erp1 by p90rsk at Thr 336, Ser 342 and Ser 344 is crucial for both stabilizing Erp1 and establishing CSF arrest in meiosis II oocytes. Semi-quantitative analysis with CSF-arrested egg extracts reveals that the Mos-dependent phosphorylation of Erp1 enhances, but does not generate, the activity of Erp1 that maintains metaphase arrest. Our results also suggest that Erp1 inhibits cyclin B degradation by binding the APC/C at its carboxy-terminal destruction box(10), and this binding is also enhanced by the Mos-dependent phosphorylation. Thus, Mos and Erp1 collaboratively establish and maintain metaphase II arrest in Xenopus eggs. The link between Mos and Erp1 provides a molecular explanation for the integral mechanism of CSF arrest in unfertilized vertebrate eggs.","Tokyo Inst Technol, Grad Sch Biosci & Biotechnol, Lab Cell & Dev Biol, Midori Ku, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2268501, Japan","Ohsumi, K (reprint author), Tokyo Inst Technol, Grad Sch Biosci & Biotechnol, Lab Cell & Dev Biol, Midori Ku, 4259 Nagatsuta, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2268501, Japan.",kohsumi@bio.titech.ac.jp,,,,,,29,82,82,0,6,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,26-Apr,2007,446,7139,,,,,1096,1099,,10.1038/nature05696,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,160NU,WOS:000245950400053,17410129,No,,,11/20/17

The classical Mos - MAPK pathway has long been implicated in CSF arrest of vertebrate eggs, but exactly how it exerts CSF activity remains unclear(2-4). Recently, Erp1 ( also called Emi2), an inhibitor of the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) required for degradation of the mitotic regulator cyclin B (ref. 5), has also been shown to be a component of CSF in both Xenopus and mice(6-8). Erp1 is destroyed on fertilization or egg activation(9,10), like Mos(11). However, despite these similarities the Mos-MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) pathway and Erp1 are thought to act rather independently in CSF arrest(3,6,8). Here, we show that p90rsk, the kinase immediately downstream from Mos MAPK, directly targets Erp1 for CSF arrest in Xenopus oocytes. Erp1 is synthesized immediately after meiosis I, and the Mos MAPK pathway or p90rsk is essential for CSF arrest by Erp1. p90rsk can directly phosphorylate Erp1 on Ser 335/Thr 336 both in vivo and in vitro, and upregulates both Erp1 stability and activity. Erp1 is also present in early embryos, but has little CSF activity owing, at least in part, to the absence of p90rsk activity. These results clarify the direct link of the classical Mos - MAPK pathway to Erp1 in meiotic arrest of vertebrate oocytes.","Kyushu Univ, Grad Sch Sci, Dept Biol, Fukuoka 8128581, Japan; Japan Sci & Technol Agcy, CREST, Kawaguchi, Saitama 3320012, Japan","Sagata, N (reprint author), Kyushu Univ, Grad Sch Sci, Dept Biol, Hakozaki 6-10-1, Fukuoka 8128581, Japan.",nsagascb@mbox.nc.kyushu-u.ac.jp,"U-ID, Kyushu/C-5291-2016",,,,,29,84,85,0,7,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,26-Apr,2007,446,7139,,,,,1100,1104,,10.1038/nature05688,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,160NU,WOS:000245950400054,17410130,No,,,11/20/17

In all higher animals studied, we have found many fewer genes than we would have previously expected. The functional outputs of the eventual products of genes seem to be far more complex than the more restricted blueprint. In higher organisms, the functions of many proteins are modulated by post-translational modifications (PTMs)(1). These alterations of amino-acid side chains lead to higher structural and functional protein diversity and are, therefore, a leading contender for an explanation for this seeming incongruity. Natural protein production methods typically produce PTM mixtures within which function is difficult to dissect or control. Until now it has not been possible to access pure mimics of complex PTMs. Here we report a chemical tagging approach that enables the attachment of multiple modifications to bacterially expressed ( bare) protein scaffolds: this approach allows reconstitution of functionally effective mimics of higher organism PTMs. By attaching appropriate modifications at suitable distances in the widely-used LacZ reporter enzyme scaffold, we created protein probes that included sensitive systems for detection of mammalian brain inflammation and disease. Through target synthesis of the desired modification, chemistry provides a structural precision and an ability to retool with a chosen PTM in a manner not available to other approaches. In this way, combining chemical control of PTM with readily available protein scaffolds provides a systematic platform for creating probes of protein PTM interactions. We therefore anticipate that this ability to build model systems 2 will allow some of this gene product complexity to be dissected, with the aim of eventually being able to completely duplicate the patterns of a particular protein's PTMs from an in vivo assay into an in vitro system.","Univ Oxford, Dept Chem, Chem Res Lab, Oxford OX1 3TA, England; Univ Oxford, Dept Pharmacol, Oxford OX1 3QT, England","Davis, BG (reprint author), Univ Oxford, Dept Chem, Chem Res Lab, Mansfield Rd, Oxford OX1 3TA, England.",Ben.Davis@chem.ox.ac.uk,"Anthony, Daniel/F-7765-2010; Davis, Benjamin/C-5281-2011","Anthony, Daniel/0000-0003-1380-6655; Davis, Benjamin/0000-0002-5056-407X; Kramer, Holger/0000-0002-6400-0945; Oldham, Neil/0000-0001-8024-4563",Medical Research Council [G0500853],,,30,187,189,11,94,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,26-Apr,2007,446,7139,,,,,1105,1109,,10.1038/nature05757,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,160NU,WOS:000245950400055,17460675,No,,,11/20/17

But quantum physics has shattered some of our cornerstone beliefs. According to Bell's theorem, any theory that is based on the joint assumption of realism and locality ( meaning that local events cannot be affected by actions in space-like separated regions) is at variance with certain quantum predictions. Experiments with entangled pairs of particles have amply confirmed these quantum predictions, thus rendering local realistic theories untenable. Maintaining realism as a fundamental concept would therefore necessitate the introduction of 'spooky' actions that defy locality. Here we show by both theory and experiment that a broad and rather reasonable class of such non-local realistic theories is incompatible with experimentally observable quantum correlations. In the experiment, we measure previously untested correlations between two entangled photons, and show that these correlations violate an inequality proposed by Leggett for non-local realistic theories. Our result suggests that giving up the concept of locality is not sufficient to be consistent with quantum experiments, unless certain intuitive features of realism are abandoned.","Univ Vienna, Fac Phys, A-1090 Vienna, Austria; Austrian Acad Sci, IQOQI, A-1090 Vienna, Austria; Univ Gdansk, Inst Theoret Phys & Astrophys, PL-08952 Gdansk, Poland; Erwin Schrodinger Int Inst Math Phys, A-1090 Vienna, Austria","Aspelmeyer, M (reprint author), Univ Vienna, Fac Phys, Boltzmanngasse 5, A-1090 Vienna, Austria.",markus.aspelmeyer@quantum.at; zeilinger-office@quantum.at,"Brukner, Caslav/C-1405-2011; Groeblacher, Simon/O-2455-2014; Kaltenbaek, Rainer/C-8141-2015; Aspelmeyer, Markus/C-4098-2017","Kaltenbaek, Rainer/0000-0002-9991-9919; Aspelmeyer, Markus/0000-0003-4499-7335; Zukowski, Marek/0000-0001-7882-7962",,,,31,184,185,4,32,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,19-Apr,2007,446,7138,,,,,871,875,,10.1038/nature05677,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,158IR,WOS:000245785700033,17443179,No,,,11/20/17

Its operation is essential for accurate chromosome segregation, whereas its dysregulation can contribute to birth defects and tumorigenesis. The target of the spindle checkpoint is the anaphase-promoting complex (APC), a ubiquitin ligase that promotes sister chromatid separation and progression to anaphase. Using a short hairpin RNA screen targeting components of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway in human cells, we identified the deubiquitinating enzyme USP44 (ubiquitin-specific protease 44) as a critical regulator of the spindle checkpoint. USP44 is not required for the initial recognition of unattached kinetochores and the subsequent recruitment of checkpoint components. Instead, it prevents the premature activation of the APC by stabilizing the APC-inhibitory Mad2 - Cdc20 complex. USP44 deubiquitinates the APC coactivator Cdc20 both in vitro and in vivo, and thereby directly counteracts the APC-driven disassembly of Mad2 - Cdc20 complexes ( discussed in an accompanying paper). Our findings suggest that a dynamic balance of ubiquitination by the APC and deubiquitination by USP44 contributes to the generation of the switch-like transition controlling anaphase entry, analogous to the way that phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of Cdk1 by Wee1 and Cdc25 controls entry into mitosis.","Harvard Univ, Harvard Partners Ctr Genet & Genom, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Dept Genet,Sch Med, Boston, MA 02115 USA; Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Pathol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Syst Biol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; MIT, Dept Biol, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; Cold Spring Harbor Lab, Watson Sch Biol Sci, Cold Spring Harbor, NY 11724 USA","Elledge, SJ (reprint author), Harvard Univ, Harvard Partners Ctr Genet & Genom, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Dept Genet,Sch Med, 77 Ave Louis Pasteur, Boston, MA 02115 USA.",marc@hms.harvard.edu; wade_harper@hms.harvard.edu; selledge@genetics.med.harvard.edu,,"Nalepa, Grzegorz/0000-0002-5779-9103; Lab, Nalepa/0000-0002-7560-1906; Cambronne, Xiaolu/0000-0002-3547-448X; Sorger, Peter/0000-0002-3364-1838",NIA NIH HHS [R01 AG011085]; NINDS NIH HHS [F31 NS054507-01],,,25,237,243,0,10,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,19-Apr,2007,446,7138,,,,,876,881,,10.1038/nature05694,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,158IR,WOS:000245785700034,17443180,No,,,11/20/17

One thing that remains unclear is how specific members of histone modification enzyme families, such as histone methyltransferases and demethylases, are used in vivo to simultaneously orchestrate distinct developmental gene activation and repression programmes. Here, we report that the histone lysine demethylase, LSD1 - a component of the CoREST-CtBP co- repressor complex - is required for late cell-lineage determination and differentiation during pituitary organogenesis. LSD1 seems to act primarily on target gene activation programmes, as well as in gene repression programmes, on the basis of recruitment of distinct LSD1-containing co- activator or co- repressor complexes. LSD1-dependent gene repression programmes can be extended late in development with the induced expression of ZEB1, a Kruppel-like repressor that can act as a molecular beacon for recruitment of the LSD1-containing CoREST-CtBP co- repressor complex, causing repression of an additional cohort of genes, such as Gh, which previously required LSD1 for activation.

Planetesimals collided to form Moon-to-Mars-sized protoplanets in the inner Solar System in 0.1 - 1 Myr, and these collided more energetically to form planets(1). Insights into the timing and nature of collisions during planetary accretion can be gained from meteorite studies. In particular, iron meteorites offer the best constraints on early stages of planetary accretion because most are remnants of the oldest bodies, which accreted and melted in < 1.5 Myr, forming silicate mantles and iron-nickel metallic cores(2-4). Cooling rates for various groups of iron meteorites suggest that if the irons cooled isothermally in the cores of differentiated bodies, as conventionally assumed, these bodies were 5 -200 km in diameter(5,6). This picture is incompatible, however, with the diverse cooling rates observed within certain groups, most notably the IVA group(7,8), but the large uncertainties associated with the measurements do not preclude it. Here we report cooling rates for group IVA iron meteorites that range from 100 to 6,000 K Myr(-1), increasing with decreasing bulk Ni. Improvements in the cooling rate model, smaller error bars, and new data from an independent cooling rate indicator(9) show that the conventional interpretation is no longer viable. Our results require that the IVA meteorites cooled in a 300-km-diameter metallic body that lacked an insulating mantle. This body probably formed similar to 4,500 Myr ago in a 'hit-and-run' collision between Moon-to-Mars-sized protoplanets(10). This demonstrates that protoplanets of similar to 10(3) km size accreted within the first 1.5 Myr, as proposed by theory, and that fragments of these bodies survived as asteroids.","Univ Massachusetts, Dept Mech & Ind Engn, Amherst, MA 01003 USA; Univ Hawaii Manoa, Hawaii Inst Geophys & Planetol, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA","Yang, JJ (reprint author), Univ Massachusetts, Dept Mech & Ind Engn, Amherst, MA 01003 USA.",jiyang@ecs.umass.edu,,,,,,30,65,65,3,21,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,19-Apr,2007,446,7138,,,,,888,891,,10.1038/nature05735,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,158IR,WOS:000245785700036,17443181,No,,,11/20/17

Quantum scattering and the underlying phase shifts are vitally important in many areas of contemporary atomic physics, including Bose - Einstein condensates(1-5), degenerate Fermi gases(6-9), frequency shifts in atomic clocks(10-12) and magnetically tuned Feshbach resonances(13). Precise experimental measurements of quantum scattering phase shifts have not been possible because the number of scattered atoms depends on the s-wave phase shifts as well as the atomic density, which cannot be measured precisely. Here we demonstrate a scattering experiment in which the quantum scattering phase shifts of individual atoms are detected using a novel atom interferometer. By performing an atomic clock measurement using only the scattered part of each atom's wavefunction, we precisely measure the difference of the s-wave phase shifts for the two clock states in a density-independent manner.

But most models do agree that the continental crust was extracted from the mantle by partial melting(3). If so, such crustal extraction should have left a chemical fingerprint in the isotopic composition of the mantle. The subduction of oceanic crust and subsequent convective mixing, however, seems to have largely erased this record in most mantle isotopic systems ( for example, strontium, neodymium and lead). In contrast, helium is not recycled into the mantle because it is volatile and degasses from erupted oceanic basalts. Therefore helium isotopes may potentially preserve a clearer record of mantle depletion than recycled isotopes. Here I show that the spectrum of He-4/He-3 ratios in ocean island basalts appears to preserve the mantle's depletion history, correlating closely with the ages of proposed continental growth pulses(4,5). The correlation independently predicts both the dominant He-4/He-3 peak found in modern mid-ocean-ridge basalts, as well as estimates of the initial He-4/He-3 ratio of the Earth(6). The correspondence between the ages of mantle depletion events and pulses of crustal production implies that the formation of the continental crust was indeed episodic and punctuated by large, potentially global, melting events. The proposed helium isotopic evolution model does not require a primitive, undegassed mantle reservoir, and therefore is consistent with whole mantle convection.","Univ Durham, Dept Earth Sci, Durham DH1 3LE, England","Parman, SW (reprint author), Univ Durham, Dept Earth Sci, South Rd, Durham DH1 3LE, England.",stephen.parman@durham.ac.uk,,"Parman, Stephen/0000-0002-7523-8684",,,,31,60,62,0,32,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,19-Apr,2007,446,7138,,,,,900,903,,10.1038/nature05691,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,158IR,WOS:000245785700039,17443184,No,,,11/20/17

The oldest trees are often thought to be of latest Devonian age ( about 380 - 360 Myr old) as indicated by the widespread occurrence of Archaeopteris (Progymnospermopsida)(4). Late Middle Devonian fossil tree stumps, rooted and still in life position, discovered in the 1870s from Gilboa, New York(5), and later named Eospermatopteris, are widely cited as evidence of the Earth's 'oldest forest'(6,7). However, their affinities and significance have proved to be elusive because the aerial portion of the plant has been unknown until now. Here we report spectacular specimens from Schoharie County, New York, showing an intact crown belonging to the cladoxylopsid Wattieza (Pseudosporochnales)(8) and its attachment to Eospermatopteris trunk and base. This evidence allows the reconstruction of a tall ( at least 8 m), tree-fern-like plant with a trunk bearing large branches in longitudinal ranks. The branches were probably abscised as frond-like modules. Lower portions of the trunk show longitudinal carbonaceous strands typical of Eospermatopteris, and a flat bottom with many small anchoring roots.

The tree-fern-like morphology described here is the oldest example so far of an evolutionarily recurrent arborescent body plan within vascular plants.

Here we show that six patients with focal bilateral damage to the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (VMPC), a brain region necessary for the normal generation of emotions and, in particular, social emotions(12-14), produce an abnormally 'utilitarian' pattern of judgements on moral dilemmas that pit compelling considerations of aggregate welfare against highly emotionally aversive behaviours ( for example, having to sacrifice one person's life to save a number of other lives)(7,8). In contrast, the VMPC patients' judgements were normal in other classes of moral dilemmas. These findings indicate that, for a selective set of moral dilemmas, the VMPC is critical for normal judgements of right and wrong.

But perceptual illusions might also result from the way the brain decodes sensory information(2), reflecting the strategies that optimize performance in particular tasks. In a fine discrimination task, the most accurate information comes from neurons tuned away from the discrimination boundary(3,4), and observers seem to use signals from these 'displaced' neurons to optimize their performance(5,6,7). We wondered whether using signals from these neurons might also bias perception. In a fine direction discrimination task using moving random-dot stimuli, we found that observers' perception of the direction of motion is indeed biased away from the boundary. This misperception can be accurately described by a decoding model that preferentially weights signals from neurons whose responses best discriminate those directions. In a coarse discrimination task, to which a different decoding rule applies(4), the same stimulus is not misperceived, suggesting that the illusion is a direct consequence of the decoding strategy that observers use to make fine perceptual judgments. The subjective experience of motion is therefore not mediated directly by the responses of sensory neurons, but is only developed after the responses of these neurons are decoded.","NYU, Ctr Neural Sci, New York, NY 10003 USA","Jazayeri, M (reprint author), NYU, Ctr Neural Sci, 4 Washington Pl, New York, NY 10003 USA.",mjaz@cns.nyu.edu,,,"NEI NIH HHS [R01 EY002017, R01 EY002017-24, R01 EY004440, R01 EY004440-26]",,,13,73,73,0,16,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,19-Apr,2007,446,7138,,,,,912,915,,10.1038/nature05739,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,158IR,WOS:000245785700042,17410125,No,,,11/20/17

Furthermore, members of the tripartite motif ( TRIM) protein family, which contain a cluster of a RING-finger domain, a B box/coiled-coil domain and a SPRY domain, are involved in various cellular processes, including cell proliferation and antiviral activity(7). Here we report that the amino-terminal caspase recruitment domains (CARDs) of RIG-I undergo robust ubiquitination induced by TRIM25 in mammalian cells. The carboxy-terminal SPRY domain of TRIM25 interacts with the N-terminal CARDs of RIG-I; this interaction effectively delivers the Lys 63-linked ubiquitin moiety to the N-terminal CARDs of RIG-I, resulting in a marked increase in RIG-I downstream signalling activity. The Lys 172 residue of RIG-I is critical for efficient TRIM25-mediated ubiquitination and for MAVS binding, as well as the ability of RIG-I to induce antiviral signal transduction. Furthermore, gene targeting demonstrates that TRIM25 is essential not only for RIG-I ubiquitination but also for RIG-I-mediated interferon-beta production and antiviral activity in response to RNA virus infection. Thus, we demonstrate that TRIM25 E3 ubiquitin ligase induces the Lys 63-linked ubiquitination of RIG-I, which is crucial for the cytosolic RIG-I signalling pathway to elicit host antiviral innate immunity.","Harvard Univ, New England Primate Res Ctr, Sch Med, Dept Microbiol & Mol Genet, Southborough, MA 01772 USA; Harvard Univ, New England Primate Res Ctr, Sch Med, Div Tumor Virol, Southborough, MA 01772 USA; Univ Erlangen Nurnberg, Inst Clin & Mol Virol, D-91054 Erlangen, Germany; Univ Ulsan, Coll Med, Dept Microbiol, Seoul 138736, South Korea; Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Med, Dept Geriatr Med, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo 1138655, Japan; Saitama Med Sch, Res Ctr Genom Med, Saitama 3501242, Japan; Univ Texas, SW Med Ctr, Dept Mol Biol, Dallas, TX 75390 USA; Japan Sci & Technol Agcy, Dept Host Def, Osaka 5650871, Japan","Jung, JU (reprint author), Harvard Univ, New England Primate Res Ctr, Sch Med, Dept Microbiol & Mol Genet, 1 Pine Hill Dr, Southborough, MA 01772 USA.",jae_jung@hms.harvard.edu,"Akira, Shizuo/C-3134-2009; Takeuchi, Osamu/D-6007-2011; Chen, Zhijian/C-6039-2012","LIANG, CHENGYU/0000-0001-6082-2143",,,,21,712,750,4,54,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,19-Apr,2007,446,7138,,,,,916,U2,,10.1038/nature05732,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,158IR,WOS:000245785700043,17392790,No,Y,N,11/20/17

The spindle checkpoint prevents sister chromatids from separating until all kinetochores achieve bipolar attachments to the mitotic spindle(1-3). Checkpoint proteins tightly inhibit the anaphase-promoting complex (APC), a ubiquitin ligase required for chromosome segregation and progression to anaphase. Unattached kinetochores promote the binding of checkpoint proteins Mad2 and BubR1 to the APC-activator Cdc20, rendering it unable to activate APC. Once all kinetochores are properly attached, however, cells inactivate the checkpoint within minutes, allowing for the rapid and synchronous segregation of chromosomes(4). How cells switch from strong APC inhibition before kinetochore attachment to rapid APC activation once attachment is complete remains a mystery. Here we show that checkpoint inactivation is an energy-consuming process involving APC-dependent multi-ubiquitination. Multi-ubiquitination by APC leads to the dissociation of Mad2 and BubR1 from Cdc20, a process that is reversed by a Cdc20-directed de-ubiquitinating enzyme(5). The mutual regulation between checkpoint proteins and APC leaves the cell poised for rapid checkpoint inactivation and ensures that chromosome segregation promptly follows the completion of kinetochore attachment. In addition, our results suggest a mechanistic basis for how cancer cells can have a compromised spindle checkpoint without corresponding mutations in checkpoint genes(6).","Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Syst Biol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; Harvard Mit Div Hlth Sci & Technol, Boston, MA 02115 USA","Kirschner, MW (reprint author), Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Syst Biol, Boston, MA 02115 USA.",marc@hms.harvard.edu,,,,,,22,223,231,0,12,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,19-Apr,2007,446,7138,,,,,921,925,,10.1038/nature05734,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,158IR,WOS:000245785700044,17443186,No,,,11/20/17

Whereas these regions can act as transcriptional enhancers when upstream of genes, those within genes are less well understood. In particular, the function of ultraconserved elements that overlap alternatively spliced exons of genes encoding RNA-binding proteins is unknown(1,2). Here we report that in every member of the human SR family of splicing regulators, highly or ultraconserved elements are alternatively spliced, either as alternative 'poison cassette exons' containing early in-frame stop codons, or as alternative introns in the 3' untranslated region. These alternative splicing events target the resulting messenger RNAs for degradation by means of an RNA surveillance pathway called nonsense-mediated mRNA decay. Mouse orthologues of the human SR proteins exhibit the same unproductive splicing patterns. Three SR proteins have been previously shown to direct splicing of their own transcripts, and one of these is known to autoregulate its expression by coupling alternative splicing with decay(3-5); our results suggest that unproductive splicing is important for regulation of the entire SR family. We find that unproductive splicing associated with conserved regions has arisen independently in different SR genes, suggesting that splicing factors may readily acquire this form of regulation.","Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Cell & Mol Biol, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Plant & Microbial Biol, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA","Brenner, SE (reprint author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Cell & Mol Biol, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",brenner@compbio.berkeley.edu,"Brenner, Steven/A-8729-2008","Brenner, Steven/0000-0001-7559-6185",,,,30,305,307,2,14,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,19-Apr,2007,446,7138,,,,,926,929,,10.1038/nature05676,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,158IR,WOS:000245785700045,17361132,No,,,11/20/17

This analysis produces a 'Phi-value' for a given residue that reflects its open-like versus closed-like character at the transition state. Here we show that most of the residues throughout the length of M2 have a Phi-value of similar to 0.64 but that some near the middle have lower Phi-values of 0.52 or 0.31, suggesting that alpha M2 moves in three discrete steps.

The PAX5 gene was the most frequent target of somatic mutation, being altered in 31.7% of cases.

Theoretical methods have been developed to maximize the information gained from a quantum measurement while also minimizing disturbance(2-4), but laboratory implementation of optimal measurement procedures is often difficult. The standard class of operations considered in quantum information theory(5) tends to rely on superposition-basis and entangled measurements(6), which require high-fidelity implementation to be effective in the laboratory(7). Here we demonstrate that real-time quantum feedback(8-10) can be used in place of a delicate quantum superposition, often called a 'Schrodinger cat state', to implement an optimal quantum measurement for discriminating between optical coherent states(11,12). Our procedure actively manipulates the target system during the measurement process, and uses quantum feedback to modify the statistics of an otherwise sub-optimal operator to emulate the optimal cat-state measurement. We verify a long-standing theoretical prediction(13) and demonstrate feedback-mediated quantum measurement(10,14) at its fundamental quantum limit over a non-trivial region of parameter space.","Univ New Mexico, Dept Phys & Astron, Quantum Measurement & Control Grp, Albuquerque, NM 87131 USA","Geremia, JM (reprint author), Univ New Mexico, Dept Phys & Astron, Quantum Measurement & Control Grp, Albuquerque, NM 87131 USA.",jgeremia@unm.edu,,,,,,19,116,116,1,9,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,12-Apr,2007,446,7137,,,,,774,777,,10.1038/nature05655,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,156CX,WOS:000245626800035,17429395,No,,,11/20/17

A particularly intriguing possibility is offered by light-responsive materials, which allow remote operation without the need for direct contact to the actuator. The photo-response of these materials is based on the photoisomerization of constituent molecules ( typically trans - cis isomerization of azobenzene chromophores), which gives rise to molecular motions and thereby deforms the bulk material. This effect has been used to create light-deformable polymer films and gels(2-10), but the response of these systems is relatively slow. Here we report that molecular crystals based on diarylethene chromophores and with sizes ranging from 10 to 100 micrometres exhibit rapid and reversible macroscopic changes in shape and size induced by ultraviolet and visible light. We find that on exposure to ultraviolet light, a single crystal of 1,2-bis(2-ethyl-5-phenyl-3-thienyl) perfluorocyclopentene changes from a square shape to a lozenge shape, whereas a rectangular single crystal of 1,2-bis(5-methyl-2-phenyl- 4-thiazolyl) perfluorocyclopentene contracts by about 5 - 7 per cent. The deformed crystals are thermally stable, and switch back to their original state on irradiation with visible light. We find that our crystals respond in about 25 microseconds ( that is, about five orders of magnitude faster than the response time of the azobenzene-based polymer systems(7-10)) and that they can move microscopic objects, making them promising materials for possible light-driven actuator applications.","Kyushu Univ, Grad Sch Engn, Dept Chem & Biochem, Fukuoka 8128581, Japan; Osaka City Univ, Grad Sch Engn, Dept Appl Chem, Sumiyoshi Ku, Osaka 5588585, Japan","Irie, M (reprint author), Kyushu Univ, Grad Sch Engn, Dept Chem & Biochem, Hakozaki 6-10-1, Fukuoka 8128581, Japan.",irie@cstf.kyushu-u.ac.jp,"Kobatake, Seiya/P-4989-2015; U-ID, Kyushu/C-5291-2016","Kobatake, Seiya/0000-0002-1526-4629; ",,,,20,564,572,47,457,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,12-Apr,2007,446,7137,,,,,778,781,,10.1038/nature05669,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,156CX,WOS:000245626800036,17429396,No,Y,N,11/20/17

The energy transfer mechanism is often described by semiclassical models that invoke 'hopping' of excited-state populations along discrete energy levels(1,2). Two-dimensional Fourier transform electronic spectroscopy(3-5) has mapped(6) these energy levels and their coupling in the Fenna - Matthews - Olson (FMO) bacteriochlorophyll complex, which is found in green sulphur bacteria and acts as an energy 'wire' connecting a large peripheral light-harvesting antenna, the chlorosome, to the reaction centre(7-9). The spectroscopic data clearly document the dependence of the dominant energy transport pathways on the spatial properties of the excited-state wavefunctions of the whole bacteriochlorophyll complex(6,10). But the intricate dynamics of quantum coherence, which has no classical analogue, was largely neglected in the analyses - even though electronic energy transfer involving oscillatory populations of donors and acceptors was first discussed more than 70 years ago(11), and electronic quantum beats arising from quantum coherence in photosynthetic complexes have been predicted(12,13) and indirectly observed(14). Here we extend previous two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy investigations of the FMO bacteriochlorophyll complex, and obtain direct evidence for remarkably long-lived electronic quantum coherence playing an important part in energy transfer processes within this system. The quantum coherence manifests itself in characteristic, directly observable quantum beating signals among the excitons within the Chlorobium tepidum FMO complex at 77 K. This wavelike characteristic of the energy transfer within the photosynthetic complex can explain its extreme efficiency, in that it allows the complexes to sample vast areas of phase space to find the most efficient path.","Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Chem, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; Univ Calif Berkeley, Inst QB3, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; Univ Calif Berkeley, Lawrence Berkeley Lab, Phys Biosci Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; Washington Univ, Dept Chem, St Louis, MO 63130 USA; Washington Univ, Dept Biol, St Louis, MO 63130 USA","Fleming, GR (reprint author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Chem, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",grfleming@lbl.gov,"Cheng, Yuan-Chung/A-6566-2008; Engel, Gregory/C-1108-2012; Ahn, Tae/A-5838-2013; Mancal, Tomas/B-9688-2014","Cheng, Yuan-Chung/0000-0003-0125-4267; Engel, Gregory/0000-0002-6740-5243; Ahn, Tae/0000-0002-7474-6513; Mancal, Tomas/0000-0003-1736-3054",,,,30,1581,1596,40,487,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,12-Apr,2007,446,7137,,,,,782,786,,10.1038/nature05678,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,156CX,WOS:000245626800037,17429397,No,Y,N,11/20/17

Their location approximately coincides with 600 to 800 degrees C isotherms in thermal models(2), suggesting a thermally activated mechanism for their origin. Some earthquakes may occur by frictional failure owing to high pore pressure that might result from metamorphic dehydration(2-5). Because some intermediate-depth earthquakes occur similar to 30 to 50 km below the palaeo-sea floor(6), however, the hydrous minerals required for the dehydration mechanism may not be present. Here we present an alternative mechanism to explain such earthquakes, involving the onset of highly localized viscous creep in pre-existing, fine-grained shear zones. Our numerical model uses olivine flow laws for a fine-grained, viscous shear zone in a coarse-grained, elastic half space, with initial temperatures from 600 - 800 degrees C and background strain rates of 10(-12) to 10(-15) s(-1). When shear heating becomes important, strain rate and temperature increase rapidly to over 1 s(-1) and 1,400 degrees C. The stress then drops dramatically, followed by low strain rates and cooling. Continued far-field deformation produces a quasi-periodic series of such instabilities.","Columbia Univ, Lamont Doherty Earth Observ, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, Palisades, NY 10964 USA; Woods Hole Oceanog Inst, Dept Geol & Geophys, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA","Kelemen, PB (reprint author), Columbia Univ, Lamont Doherty Earth Observ, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, Palisades, NY 10964 USA.",peterk@ldeo.columbia.edu,"Kelemen, Peter/D-6813-2013","Kelemen, Peter/0000-0003-4757-0855",,,,30,107,108,1,37,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,12-Apr,2007,446,7137,,,,,787,790,,10.1038/nature05717,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,156CX,WOS:000245626800038,17429398,No,,,11/20/17

Although numerous alternative theories have provided potential explanations for this high biodiversity, there have been few field experiments testing between these theories. In particular, theory predicts that higher diversity of coexisting competitors could result from greater niche dimensionality(1), for example larger numbers of limiting resources or factors. Alternatively, diversity could be independent of niche dimensionality because large numbers of species can coexist when limited by just one or two factors if species have appropriate trade-offs(2). Here we show that plant coexistence and diversity result from the 'niche dimensionality' of a habitat. Plant species numbers decreased with increasing numbers of added limiting soil resources ( soil moisture, nitrogen, phosphorus and base cations), which is consistent with theoretical predictions that an increased supply of multiple limiting resources can reduce niche dimension. An observational field study gave similar results. The niche dimension hypothesis also explained diversity changes in the classic Park Grass Experiment at Rothamsted. Our results provide an alternative mechanistic explanation for the effects of nutrient eutrophication on the diversity of terrestrial, freshwater and marine ecosystems.","Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Irvine, CA 92697 USA; Univ Minnesota, Dept Ecol Evolut & Behav, St Paul, MN 55108 USA","Harpole, WS (reprint author), Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, 321 Steinhaus Hall, Irvine, CA 92697 USA.",wharpole@uci.edu,"Harpole, William/C-2814-2013","Harpole, William/0000-0002-3404-9174",,,,24,210,230,14,259,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,12-Apr,2007,446,7137,,,,,791,793,,10.1038/nature05684,,3,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,156CX,WOS:000245626800039,17384633,No,,,11/20/17

What motivates this action is unclear: punishment and reward aimed at promoting cooperation cannot be distinguished from attempts to produce equality(4). To understand costly taking and costly giving, we create an experimental game that isolates egalitarian motives. The results show that subjects reduce and augment others' incomes, at a personal cost, even when there is no cooperative behaviour to be reinforced. Furthermore, the size and frequency of income alterations are strongly influenced by inequality. Emotions towards top earners become increasingly negative as inequality increases, and those who express these emotions spend more to reduce above-average earners' incomes and to increase below-average earners' incomes. The results suggest that egalitarian motives affect income-altering behaviours, and may therefore be an important factor underlying the evolution of strong reciprocity(5) and, hence, cooperation in humans.","Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Polit Sci, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; Max Planck Inst Human Dev, Ctr Adapt Behav & Cognit, D-14195 Berlin, Germany; Stanford Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; Univ Calif Davis, Dept Anthropol, Davis, CA 95616 USA; Univ Miami, Dept Polit Sci, Coral Gables, FL 33124 USA","Fowler, JH (reprint author), Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Polit Sci, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.",jhfowler@ucsd.edu,"Fowler, James/C-2750-2008; Henrich, Joseph/A-2403-2009","Fowler, James/0000-0001-7795-1638; McElreath, Richard/0000-0002-0387-5377",,,,14,180,186,4,40,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,12-Apr,2007,446,7137,,,,,794,796,,10.1038/nature05651,,3,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,156CX,WOS:000245626800040,17429399,No,,,11/20/17

In addition, oriented cell division can have a powerful influence on tissue morphogenesis(3). Here we identify a novel mode of polarized cell division that generates pairs of neural progenitors with mirror-symmetric polarity in the developing zebrafish neural tube and has dramatic consequences for the organization of embryonic tissue. We show that during neural rod formation the polarity protein Pard3 is localized to the cleavage furrow of dividing progenitors, and then mirror-symmetrically inherited by the two daughter cells. This allows the daughter cells to integrate into opposite sides of the developing neural tube. Furthermore, these mirror-symmetric divisions have powerful morphogenetic influence: when forced to occur in ectopic locations during neurulation, they orchestrate the development of mirror-image pattern formation and the consequent generation of ectopic neural tubes.","UCL, London WC1E 6BT, England; Univ Cologne, Inst Entwicklungsbiol, D-50923 Cologne, Germany; Univ Notre Dame, Dept Biol Sci, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA; Univ Notre Dame, Ctr Zebrafish Res, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA","Clarke, JDW (reprint author), UCL, Gower St, London WC1E 6BT, England.",jonathan.clarke@ucl.ac.uk,"Tada, Masazumi/A-1431-2009; Zebrafish, UCL/A-3125-2009; Clarke, Jonathan/C-5347-2009",,"Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council [BB/C516952/1]; Medical Research Council [G0001188, G9900989]; Wellcome Trust",,,21,113,115,2,5,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,12-Apr,2007,446,7137,,,,,797,800,,10.1038/nature05722,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,156CX,WOS:000245626800041,17392791,No,,,11/20/17

A better understanding of the viral life cycle, including the mechanisms of entry into host cells, is needed to identify novel therapeutic targets. Although HCV entry requires the CD81 co-receptor, and other host molecules have been implicated, at least one factor critical to this process remains unknown (reviewed in refs 1 - 3). Using an iterative expression cloning approach we identified claudin-1 (CLDN1), a tight junction component that is highly expressed in the liver(4), as essential for HCV entry. CLDN1 is required for HCV infection of human hepatoma cell lines and is the first factor to confer susceptibility to HCV when ectopically expressed in non-hepatic cells. Discrete residues within the first extracellular loop (EL1) of CLDN1, but not protein interaction motifs in intracellular domains, are critical for HCV entry. Moreover, antibodies directed against an epitope inserted in the CLDN1 EL1 block HCV infection. The kinetics of this inhibition indicate that CLDN1 acts late in the entry process, after virus binding and interaction with the HCV co-receptor CD81. With CLDN1 we have identified a novel key factor for HCV entry and a new target for antiviral drug development.","Rockefeller Univ, Ctr Study Hepatitis C, New York, NY 10021 USA; Rockefeller Univ, Aaron Diamond AIDS Res Ctr, New York, NY 10016 USA","Rice, CM (reprint author), Rockefeller Univ, Ctr Study Hepatitis C, 1230 York Ave, New York, NY 10021 USA.",ricec@mail.rockefeller.edu,,"Evans, Matthew/0000-0002-4991-3877; McKeating, Jane/0000-0002-7229-5886","Medical Research Council [G0400802, G0801976]",,,29,768,811,5,70,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,12-Apr,2007,446,7137,,,,,801,805,,10.1038/nature05654,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,156CX,WOS:000245626800042,17325668,No,Y,N,11/20/17

Large-scale identification of protein complexes has provided one important step towards this goal; however, even knowledge of the stoichiometry, affinity and lifetime of every protein - protein interaction would not reveal the functional relationships between and within such complexes. Genetic interactions can provide functional information that is largely invisible to protein - protein interaction data sets. Here we present an epistatic miniarray profile (E-MAP)(1) consisting of quantitative pairwise measurements of the genetic interactions between 743 Saccharomyces cerevisiae genes involved in various aspects of chromosome biology ( including DNA replication/ repair, chromatid segregation and transcriptional regulation). This E-MAP reveals that physical interactions fall into two well-represented classes distinguished by whether or not the individual proteins act coherently to carry out a common function. Thus, genetic interaction data make it possible to dissect functionally multi-protein complexes, including Mediator, and to organize distinct protein complexes into pathways. In one pathway defined here, we show that Rtt109 is the founding member of a novel class of histone acetyltransferases responsible for Asf1-dependent acetylation of histone H3 on lysine 56. This modification, in turn, enables a ubiquitin ligase complex containing the cullin Rtt101 to ensure genomic integrity during DNA replication.","Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Mol & Cellular Pharmacol, San Francisco, CA 94158 USA; Univ Calif San Francisco, Calif Inst Quantitat Biomed Res, San Francisco, CA 94158 USA; Univ Calif San Francisco, Howard Hughes Med Inst, San Francisco, CA 94158 USA; Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Biochem & Biophys, Canc Res Inst, San Francisco, CA 94115 USA; Univ Toronto, Banting & Best Dept Med Res, Toronto, ON M5S 3E1, Canada; Rockefeller Univ, Lab Cromatin Biol, New York, NY 10021 USA; Mayo Clin, Coll Med, Dept Biochem & Mol Biol, Rochester, MN 55905 USA; Wistar Inst Anat & Biol, Gene Express & REgulat Program, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; Univ British Columbia, Michael Smith Labs, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada; Univ Toronto, Dept Biochem, Toronto, ON M5S 1A8, Canada","Weissman, JS (reprint author), Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Mol & Cellular Pharmacol, San Francisco, CA 94158 USA.",weissman@cmp.ucsf.edu; jack.greenblatt@utoronto.ca,"Schuldiner, Maya/C-9488-2009; Han, Junhong/L-5264-2013","Collins, Sean/0000-0002-4276-5840; Miller, Kyle/0000-0002-4544-0013; Schuldiner, Maya/0000-0001-9947-115X; Brown, Grant/0000-0002-9002-5003",,,,30,578,583,5,37,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,12-Apr,2007,446,7137,,,,,806,810,,10.1038/nature05649,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,156CX,WOS:000245626800043,17314980,No,Y,N,11/20/17

Both niches are superficially different and it has remained unclear whether common regulatory mechanisms exist. Here we address whether root and shoot meristems use related factors for stem cell maintenance. In the root niche the quiescent centre cells, surrounded by the stem cells, express the homeobox gene WOX5 (WUSCHEL-RELATED HOMEOBOX 5)(1), a homologue of the WUSCHEL (WUS) gene that non-cell-autonomously maintains stem cells in the shoot meristem(2). Loss of WOX5 function in the root meristem stem cell niche causes terminal differentiation in distal stem cells and, redundantly with other regulators, also provokes differentiation of the proximal meristem. Conversely, gain of WOX5 function blocks differentiation of distal stem cell descendents that normally differentiate. Importantly, both WOX5 and WUS maintain stem cells in either a root or shoot context. Together, our data indicate that stem cell maintenance signalling in both meristems employs related regulators.","Univ Freiburg, Inst Biol 3, D-79104 Freiburg, Germany; Univ Utrecht, Dept Mol Cell Biol, NL-3584 CH Utrecht, Netherlands; Nara Inst Sci & Technol, Grad Sch Biol Sci, Nara 6300192, Japan","Laux, T (reprint author), Univ Freiburg, Inst Biol 3, Schanzlestr 1, D-79104 Freiburg, Germany.",laux@biologie.uni-freiburg.de,"Lenhard, Michael/J-1554-2015","Scheres, Ben/0000-0001-5400-9578",,,,24,409,442,7,96,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,12-Apr,2007,446,7137,,,,,811,814,,10.1038/nature05703,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,156CX,WOS:000245626800044,17429400,No,,,11/20/17

Using a stringent objective statistical algorithm to reduce false discovery rates below 5%, we isolated a panel of 87 genes that represent major focal points of the autonomous response of cancer cells to the abrogation of microtubule dynamics.

Surprisingly, RNAP II molecules ceased to transcribe and were unable to recover from backtracks at a force of 7.5 +/- 2 pN, only one-third of the force determined for Escherichia coli RNAP(7,8). We show that backtrack pause durations follow a t(-3/2) power law, implying that during backtracking RNAP II diffuses in discrete base-pair steps, and indicating that backtracks may account for most of RNAP II pauses. Significantly, addition of TFIIS rescued backtracked enzymes and allowed transcription to proceed up to a force of 16.9 +/- 3.4 pN. Taken together, these results describe a regulatory mechanism of transcription elongation in eukaryotes by which transcription factors modify the mechanical performance of RNAP II, allowing it to operate against higher loads.","Univ Calif Berkeley, Lawrence Berkeley Lab, Phys Biosci Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mol & Cell Biol, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Chem, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; Univ Calif Berkeley, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; NCI, Ctr Canc Res, Frederick, MD 21702 USA","Bustamante, C (reprint author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Lawrence Berkeley Lab, Phys Biosci Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",carlos@alice.berkeley.edu,"Grill, Stephan /D-9427-2012","Galburt, Eric/0000-0003-4314-3215; Bustamante, Carlos/0000-0002-2970-0073",,,,28,148,154,1,22,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,12-Apr,2007,446,7137,,,,,820,823,,10.1038/nature05701,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,156CX,WOS:000245626800046,17361130,No,,,11/20/17

Here we report the real-time observation of this most elementary step in strong-field interactions: light-induced electron tunnelling. The process is found to deplete atomic bound states in sharp steps lasting several hundred attoseconds. This suggests a new technique, attosecond tunnelling, for probing short-lived, transient states of atoms or molecules with high temporal resolution.

NpHR is compatible with ChR2, the previous optical excitation technology we have described, in that the two opposing probes operate at similar light powers but with well-separated action spectra.

Perceived by a small family of F-box proteins including transport inhibitor response 1 (TIR1), auxin regulates gene expression by promoting SCF ubiquitin-ligase-catalysed degradation of the Aux/IAA transcription repressors, but how the TIR1 F-box protein senses and becomes activated by auxin remains unclear. Here we present the crystal structures of the Arabidopsis TIR1 - ASK1 complex, free and in complexes with three different auxin compounds and an Aux/IAA substrate peptide. These structures show that the leucine-rich repeat domain of TIR1 contains an unexpected inositol hexakisphosphate co-factor and recognizes auxin and the Aux/IAA polypeptide substrate through a single surface pocket. Anchored to the base of the TIR1 pocket, auxin binds to a partially promiscuous site, which can also accommodate various auxin analogues. Docked on top of auxin, the Aux/IAA substrate peptide occupies the rest of the TIR1 pocket and completely encloses the hormone-binding site. By filling in a hydrophobic cavity at the protein interface, auxin enhances the TIR1 - substrate interactions by acting as a 'molecular glue'.

Because of this historical record, many classical albedo patterns have long been known to shift in appearance over time. Decadal variations of the martian surface albedo are generally attributed to removal and deposition of small amounts of relatively bright dust on the surface. Large swaths of the surface ( up to 56 million km(2)) have been observed to darken or brighten by 10 per cent or more(3-5). It is unknown, however, how these albedo changes affect wind circulation, dust transport and the feedback between these processes and the martian climate. Here we present predictions from a Mars general circulation model, indicating that the observed interannual albedo alterations strongly influence the martian environment. Results indicate enhanced wind stress in recently darkened areas and decreased wind stress in brightened areas, producing a positive feedback system in which the albedo changes strengthen the winds that generate the changes. The simulations also predict a net annual global warming of surface air temperatures by similar to 0.65 K, enhancing dust lifting by increasing the likelihood of dust devil generation. The increase in global dust lifting by both wind stress and dust devils may affect the mechanisms that trigger large dust storm initiation, a poorly understood phenomenon, unique to Mars. In addition, predicted increases in summertime air temperatures at high southern latitudes would contribute to the rapid and steady scarp retreat that has been observed in the south polar residual ice for the past four Mars years(6-8). Our results suggest that documented albedo changes affect recent climate change and large-scale weather patterns on Mars, and thus albedo variations are a necessary component of future atmospheric and climate studies.","US Geol Survey, Flagstaff, AZ 86001 USA; NASA, Ames Res Ctr, Carl Sagan Ctr, Moffett Field, CA 94035 USA; NASA, Ames Res Ctr, Div Space Sci, Moffett Field, CA 94035 USA","Fenton, LK (reprint author), US Geol Survey, Flagstaff, AZ 86001 USA.",fenton@mintz.arc.nasa.gov; pgeissler@usgs.gov,,,,,,25,44,44,1,8,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,5-Apr,2007,446,7136,,,,,646,649,,10.1038/nature05718,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,153LZ,WOS:000245438300034,17410170,No,,,11/20/17

These chemically inert 4f electrons set up localized magnetic moments, which are coupled via an indirect exchange interaction involving the conduction electrons. This leads to the formation of a wide variety of magnetic structures, the periodicities of which are often incommensurate with the underlying crystal lattice(2). Such incommensurate ordering is associated with a 'webbed' topology(3,4) of the momentum space surface separating the occupied and unoccupied electron states ( the Fermi surface). The shape of this surface - and hence the magnetic structure - for the heavy rare earth elements is known to depend on the ratio of the interplanar spacing c and the interatomic, intraplanar spacing a of the h. c. p. lattice(5). A theoretical understanding of this problem is, however, far from complete. Here, using gadolinium as a prototype for all the heavy rare earth elements, we generate a unified magnetic phase diagram, which unequivocally links the magnetic structures of the heavy rare earths to their lattice parameters. In addition to verifying the importance of the c/a ratio, we find that the atomic unit cell volume plays a separate, distinct role in determining the magnetic properties: we show that the trend from ferromagnetism to incommensurate ordering as atomic number increases is connected to the concomitant decrease in unit cell volume. This volume decrease occurs because of the so-called lanthanide contraction(6), where the addition of electrons to the poorly shielding 4f orbitals leads to an increase in effective nuclear charge and, correspondingly, a decrease in ionic radii.","Univ Warwick, Dept Phys, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England; Univ Halle Wittenberg, Inst Phys, D-06099 Halle, Germany; Max Planck Inst Mikrostrukturphys, D-06120 Halle, Germany; SERC, Daresbury Lab, Warrington WA4 4AD, Cheshire, England; Mahidol Univ, Fac Sci, Dept Math, Bangkok 10400, Thailand; Aarhus Univ, Dept Phys & Astron, DK-8000 Aarhus, Denmark","Hughes, ID (reprint author), Univ Warwick, Dept Phys, Gibbet Hill Rd, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England.",i.d.hughes@warwick.ac.uk; j.b.staunton@warwick.ac.uk,"Lueders, Martin/D-1622-2010; Ernst, Arthur/K-1836-2012; Dane, Markus/H-6731-2013","Dane, Markus/0000-0001-9301-8469",,,,28,94,94,7,79,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,5-Apr,2007,446,7136,,,,,650,653,,10.1038/nature05668,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,153LZ,WOS:000245438300035,17410171,No,,,11/20/17

In modern marine sediments, the burial rates of reduced carbon and sulphur are positively coupled, but high-resolution isotope records indicate that these rates were inversely related during the Early Cretaceous period(1). This inverse relationship is difficult to reconcile with our understanding of the processes that control organic matter remineralization and pyrite burial. Here we show that the inverse correlation can be explained by the deposition of evaporites during the opening of the South Atlantic Ocean basin. Evaporite deposition can alter the chemical composition of sea water(2,3), which can in turn affect the ability of sulphate-reducing bacteria to remineralize organic matter and mediate pyrite burial. We use a reaction - transport model to quantify these effects, and the resulting changes in the burial rates of carbon and sulphur, during the Early Cretaceous period. Our results indicate that deposition of the South Atlantic evaporites removed enough sulphate from the ocean temporarily to reduce biologically mediated pyrite burial and organic matter remineralization by up to fifty per cent, thus explaining the inverse relationship between the burial rates of reduced carbon and sulphur during this interval. Furthermore, our findings suggest that the effect of changing seawater sulphate concentrations on the marine subsurface biosphere may be the key to understanding other large-scale perturbations of the global carbon and sulphur cycles.","Univ Toronto, Dept Geol, Geobiol Isotope Lab, Toronto, ON M5S 3B1, Canada","Wortmann, UG (reprint author), Univ Toronto, Dept Geol, Geobiol Isotope Lab, 22 Russell St, Toronto, ON M5S 3B1, Canada.",uli.wortmann@utoronto.ca,,"Wortmann, Ulrich/0000-0001-7854-9173",,,,28,43,43,2,30,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,5-Apr,2007,446,7136,,,,,654,656,,10.1038/nature05693,,3,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,153LZ,WOS:000245438300036,17410172,No,,,11/20/17

Palaeomagnetic and palaeointensity data from rocks formed near the boundary of the Proterozoic and Archaean eons, some 2.5 Gyr ago, show many hallmarks of the more recent geomagnetic field. Reversals are recorded(1), palaeosecular variation data(2) indicate a dipole-dominated morphology and available palaeointensity values are similar to those from younger rocks(1-3). The picture before 2.8 Gyr ago is much less clear. Rocks of the Archaean Kaapvaal craton ( South Africa) are among the best-preserved, but even they have experienced low-grade metamorphism(4). The variable acquisition of later magnetizations by these rocks is therefore expected, precluding use of conventional palaeointensity methods. Silicate crystals from igneous rocks, however, can contain minute magnetic inclusions capable of preserving Archaean-age magnetizations. Here we use a CO2 laser heating approach and direct-current SQUID magnetometer measurements to obtain palaeodirections and intensities from single silicate crystals that host magnetite inclusions. We find 3.2-Gyr-old field strengths that are within 50 per cent of the present-day value, indicating that a viable magnetosphere sheltered the early Earth's atmosphere from solar wind erosion.","Univ Rochester, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, Rochester, NY 14627 USA; Univ Rochester, Dept Phys & Astron, Rochester, NY 14627 USA; Univ KwaZulu Natal, Sch Geol Sci, ZA-4041 Durban, South Africa","Tarduno, JA (reprint author), Univ Rochester, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, 601 Elmwood Ave, Rochester, NY 14627 USA.",john@earth.rochester.edu,,,,,,30,64,64,1,14,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,5-Apr,2007,446,7136,,,,,657,660,,10.1038/nature05667,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,153LZ,WOS:000245438300037,17410173,No,,,11/20/17

Most recently, some researchers have proposed(8) that Doushantuo microfossils may be giant sulphur-oxidizing bacteria comparable to extant Thiomargarita sp. Here we report new observations that provide a test of the bacterial hypothesis. The discovery of embryo-like Doushantuo fossils inside large, highly ornamented organic vesicles (acritarchs) indicates that these organisms were eukaryotic, and most probably early cleavage stage embryos preserved within diapause egg cysts.

Our knowledge of the mechanisms governing the underlying community dynamics is limited, but is essential for a deeper understanding of the development and self-optimization of society as a whole(17-22). We have developed an algorithm based on clique percolation(23,24) that allows us to investigate the time dependence of overlapping communities on a large scale, and thus uncover basic relationships characterizing community evolution. Our focus is on networks capturing the collaboration between scientists and the calls between mobile phone users. We find that large groups persist for longer if they are capable of dynamically altering their membership, suggesting that an ability to change the group composition results in better adaptability. The behaviour of small groups displays the opposite tendency - the condition for stability is that their composition remains unchanged.

On a broader scale, such combinations are also important in understanding microbial ecology and evolution(4,5). Although the effects of multidrug combinations on bacterial growth have been studied extensively, relatively little is known about their impact on the differential selection between sensitive and resistant bacterial populations(1,6,7). Normally, the presence of a drug confers an advantage on its resistant mutants incompetition with the sensitive wild-type population(1). Here we show, by using a direct competition assay between doxycycline-resistant and doxycycline-sensitive Escherichia coli, that this differential selection can be inverted in a hyper-antagonistic class of drug combinations. Used in such a combination, a drug can render the combined treatment selective against the drug's own resistance allele. Further, this inversion of selection seems largely insensitive to the underlying resistance mechanism and occurs, at sublethal concentrations, while maintaining inhibition of the wild type. These seemingly paradoxical results can be rationalized in terms of a simple geometric argument. Our findings demonstrate a previously unappreciated feature of the fitness landscape for the evolution of resistance and point to a trade-off between the effect of drug interactions on absolute potency and the relative competitive selection that they impose on emerging resistant populations.","Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Syst Biol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; Harvard Univ, Sch Engn & Appl Sci, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA","Kishony, R (reprint author), Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Syst Biol, 200 Longwood Ave, Boston, MA 02115 USA.",roy_kishony@hms.harvard.edu,,,,,,30,189,196,6,63,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,5-Apr,2007,446,7136,,,,,668,671,,10.1038/nature05685,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,153LZ,WOS:000245438300040,17410176,No,,,11/20/17

However, unlike the comparatively well characterized vertebrate agnathan lamprey, little is known about hagfish development. The inability to analyse hagfish at early embryonic stages has frustrated attempts to resolve questions with important phylogenetic implications, including fundamental ones relating to the emergence of the neural crest(1,5,6). Here we report the obtainment of multiple pharyngula-stage embryos of the hagfish species Eptatretus burgeri and our preliminary analyses of their early development. We present histological evidence of putative neural crest cells, which appear as delaminated cells that migrate along pathways corresponding to neural crest cells in fish and amphibians(2,7-11). Molecular cloning studies further revealed the expression of several regulatory genes, including cognates of Pax6, Pax3/7, SoxEa and Sox9, suggesting that the hagfish neural crest is specified by molecular mechanisms that are general to vertebrates. We propose that the neural crest emerged as a population of de-epithelialized migratory cells in a common vertebrate ancestor, and suggest that the possibility of classical and molecular embryology in hagfish opens up new approaches to clarifying the evolutionary history of vertebrates.","RIKEN, Ctr Dev Biol, Lab Evolutionary Morphol, Kobe, Hyogo 6500047, Japan","Kuratani, S (reprint author), RIKEN, Ctr Dev Biol, Lab Evolutionary Morphol, Kobe, Hyogo 6500047, Japan.",saizo@cdb.riken.jp,"Kuratani, Shigeru/J-4146-2014; Kuraku, Shigehiro/B-2801-2009","Kuratani, Shigeru/0000-0001-9717-7221; ",,,,30,104,111,0,24,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,5-Apr,2007,446,7136,,,,,672,675,,10.1038/nature05633,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,153LZ,WOS:000245438300041,17377535,No,,,11/20/17

Inactivation of APC is also recognized as the key early event in the development of sporadic colorectal cancers(2,3), and its loss results in constitutive activity of the beta-catenin-Tcf4 transcription complex(3). The proto-oncogene c-MYC has been identified as a target of the Wnt pathway in colorectal cancer cells in vitro(4), in normal crypts in vivo(5) and in intestinal epithelial cells acutely transformed on in vivo deletion of the APC gene(6); however, the significance of this is unclear. Therefore, to elucidate the role Myc has in the intestine after Apc loss, we have simultaneously deleted both Apc and Myc in the adult murine small intestine. Here we show that loss of Myc rescued the phenotypes of perturbed differentiation, migration, proliferation and apoptosis, which occur on deletion of Apc. Remarkably, this rescue occurred in the presence of high levels of nuclear beta-catenin.

Emerging evidence suggests that semaphorins are involved not only in embryonic development but also in immune responses(2). Semaphorin 7A (Sema7A; also known as CD108)(3,4), which is a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored semaphorin, promotes axon outgrowth through beta 1-integrin receptors and contributes to the formation of the lateral olfactory tract(5). Although Sema7A has been shown to stimulate human monocytes(6), its function as a negative regulator of T-cell responses has also been reported(7). Thus, the precise function of Sema7A in the immune system remains unclear. Here we show that Sema7A, which is expressed on activated T cells, stimulates cytokine production in monocytes and macrophages through alpha 1 beta 1 integrin ( also known as very late antigen-1) as a component of the immunological synapse, and is critical for the effector phase of the inflammatory immune response. Sema7A-deficient (Sema7a(-/-)) mice are defective in cell-mediated immune responses such as contact hypersensitivity and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. Although antigen-specific and cytokine-producing effector T cells can develop and migrate into antigen-challenged sites in Sema7a(-/-) mice, Sema7a(-/-) T cells fail to induce contact hypersensitivity even when directly injected into the antigen-challenged sites. Thus, the interaction between Sema7A and alpha 1 beta 1 integrin is crucial at the site of inflammation. These findings not only identify a function of Sema7A as an effector molecule in T-cell-mediated inflammation, but also reveal a mechanism of integrin-mediated immune regulation.","JST, Dept Mol Immunol, Suita, Osaka 5650871, Japan; JST, CREST Program, Suita, Osaka 5650871, Japan; Osaka Univ, Microbial Dis Res Inst, Dept Immunopathol, Suita, Osaka 5650871, Japan; Osaka Univ, Grad Sch Med, Dept Neurol, Suita, Osaka 5650871, Japan; Univ Med Ctr Utrecht, Rudolf Magnus Inst Neurosci, Dept Pharmacol & Anat, NL-3584 CG Utrecht, Netherlands; Osaka Univ, Inst Prot Res, Lab Prot Synth & Express, Suita, Osaka 5650871, Japan; Biogen Idec Inc, Cambridge, MA 01746 USA; Johns Hopkins Univ, Sch Med, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA; Johns Hopkins Univ, Sch Med, Solomon H Snyder Dept Neurosci, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA","Kumanogoh, A (reprint author), JST, Dept Mol Immunol, 3-1 Yamadaoka, Suita, Osaka 5650871, Japan.",kumanogo@ragtime.biken.osaka-u.ac.jp; kikutani@ragtime.biken.osaka-u.ac.jp,"Kumanogoh, Atsushi/C-7354-2009; Kikutani, Hitoshi/C-9525-2009; Suzuki, Kazuhiro/B-3886-2012","Pasterkamp, Jeroen/0000-0003-1631-6440",,,,27,121,128,0,5,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,5-Apr,2007,446,7136,,,,,680,684,,10.1038/nature05652,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,153LZ,WOS:000245438300043,17377534,No,,,11/20/17

T-R cells specifically express the transcription factor Foxp3, a key regulator of T-R-cell development and function. Ectopic expression of Foxp3 in conventional T cells is indeed sufficient to confer suppressive activity, repress the production of cytokines such as interleukin-2 (IL-2) and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), and upregulate T-R-cell-associated molecules such as CD25, cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen-4, and glucocorticoid-induced TNF-receptor-family-related protein(4-7). However, the method by which Foxp3 controls these molecular events has yet to be explained. Here we show that the transcription factor AML1 ( acute myeloid leukaemia 1)/Runx1 (Runt-related transcription factor 1), which is crucially required for normal haematopoiesis including thymic T-cell development(8-11), activates IL-2 and IFN-gamma gene expression in conventional CD4(+) T cells through binding to their respective promoters. In natural T-R cells, Foxp3 interacts physically with AML1. Several lines of evidence support a model in which the interaction suppresses IL-2 and IFN-gamma production, upregulates T-R-cell-associated molecules, and exerts suppressive activity. This transcriptional control of T-R-cell function by an interaction between Foxp3 and AML1 can be exploited to control physiological and pathological T-cell-mediated immune responses.","Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Med, Inst Frontier Med Sci, Dept Expt Pathol, Kyoto 6068507, Japan; Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Med, Dept Dermatol, Kyoto 6068507, Japan; Natl Canc Ctr, Res Inst, Div Mol Oncol, Chuo Ku, Tokyo 1040045, Japan; Japan Sci & Technol Agcy, CREST, Kawaguchi 3320012, Japan; Natl Canc Ctr, Res Inst, Tumor Endocrinol Project, Chuo Ku, Tokyo 1040045, Japan","Sakaguchi, S (reprint author), Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Med, Inst Frontier Med Sci, Dept Expt Pathol, Kyoto 6068507, Japan.",shimon@frontier.kyoto-u.ac.jp,"Sakaguchi, Shimon/C-9535-2009; Ono, Masahiro/H-2378-2011; Kitabayashi, Issay/G-2204-2017","Ono, Masahiro/0000-0002-9284-7326; ",,,,28,362,390,0,8,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,5-Apr,2007,446,7136,,,,,685,689,,10.1038/nature05673,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,153LZ,WOS:000245438300044,17377532,No,Y,N,11/20/17

NF-kappa B was also proposed to promote metastatogenesis through epithelial - mesenchymal transition(2). Yet a mechanistic link between inflammation and metastasis is missing. We identified a role for I kappa B kinase alpha (IKK alpha), activated by receptor activator of NF-kappa B (RANK/TNFRSF11A), in mammary epithelial proliferation during pregnancy(3). Owing to similarities between mammary and prostate epithelia, we examined IKK alpha involvement in prostate cancer and its progression. Here we show that a mutation that prevents IKK alpha activation slows down CaP growth and inhibits metastatogenesis in TRAMP mice, which express SV40 T antigen in the prostate epithelium(4). Decreased metastasis correlated with elevated expression of the metastasis suppressor Maspin(5), the ablation of which restored metastatic activity. IKK alpha activation by RANK ligand (RANKL/TNFSF11) inhibits Maspin expression in prostate epithelial cells, whereas repression of Maspin transcription requires nuclear translocation of active IKK alpha. The amount of active nuclear IKK alpha in mouse and human prostate cancer correlates with metastatic progression, reduced Maspin expression and infiltration of prostate tumours with RANKL-expressing inflammatory cells. We propose that tumour-infiltrating RANKL-expressing cells lead to nuclear IKK alpha activation and inhibition of Maspin transcription, thereby promoting the metastatic phenotype.","Univ Calif San Diego, Sch Med, Dept Pharmacol, Lab Gene Regulat & Signal Transduct, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; Univ Calif San Diego, Sch Med, Ctr Canc, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Pathol, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; Univ Calif San Diego, Moores Canc Ctr, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; Baylor Coll Med, Dept Mol & Cellular Biol, Houston, TX 77030 USA","Karin, M (reprint author), Univ Calif San Diego, Sch Med, Dept Pharmacol, Lab Gene Regulat & Signal Transduct, 9500 Gilman Dr, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.",karinoffice@ucsd.edu,,,NCI NIH HHS [R01 CA127923],,,30,272,286,2,22,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,5-Apr,2007,446,7136,,,,,690,694,,10.1038/nature05656,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,153LZ,WOS:000245438300045,17377533,No,,,11/20/17

Our analyses of how extant lineages accumulated through time show that net per-lineage diversification rates barely changed across the Cretaceous/Tertiary boundary. Instead, these rates spiked significantly with the origins of the currently recognized placental superorders and orders approximately 93 million years ago, before falling and remaining low until accelerating again throughout the Eocene and Oligocene epochs.

Plutonium displays phases with enormous volume differences, and both its Pauli-like magnetic susceptibility and resistivity are an order of magnitude larger than those of simple metals 2. Curium is also highly resistive, but its susceptibility is Curie-like at high temperatures and orders antiferromagnetically 3 at low temperatures. The anomalous properties of the late actinides stem from the competition between itinerancy and localization of their f-shell electrons, which makes these elements strongly correlated materials. A central problem in this field is to understand the mechanism by which these conflicting tendencies are resolved in such materials. Here we identify the electronic mechanisms responsible for the anomalous behaviour of late actinides, revisiting the concept of valence using a theoretical approach that treats magnetism, Kondo screening, atomic multiplet effects and crystal field splitting on the same footing. We find that the ground state in plutonium is a quantum superposition of two distinct atomic valences, whereas curium settles into a magnetically ordered single valence state at low temperatures. The f(7) configuration of curium is contrasted with the multiple valences of the plutonium ground state, which we characterize by a valence histogram. The balance between the Kondo screening and magnetism is controlled by the competition between spin-orbit coupling, the strength of atomic multiplets and the degree of itinerancy. Our approach highlights the electronic origin of the bonding anomalies in plutonium, and can be applied to predict generalized valences and the presence or absence of magnetism in other compounds starting from first principles.","Rutgers State Univ, Dept Phys & Astron, Piscataway, NJ 08854 USA; Rutgers State Univ, Ctr Condensed Matter, Piscataway, NJ 08854 USA; Rutgers State Univ, Ctr Condensed Matter Theory, Piscataway, NJ 08854 USA","Haule, K (reprint author), Rutgers State Univ, Dept Phys & Astron, Piscataway, NJ 08854 USA.",haule@physics.rutgers.edu,"Shim, Ji Hoon/F-5375-2013",,,,,30,154,154,3,41,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,29-Mar,2007,446,7135,,,,,513,516,,10.1038/nature05647,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,150TQ,WOS:000245242900043,17392780,No,,,11/20/17

The enhanced transmission was originally explained by a mechanism where surface plasmon polaritons ( collective electronic excitations in the metal surface) mediate light transmission through the grating(1,3). In this picture, structural periodicity is perceived to be crucial in forming the transmission resonances. Here we demonstrate experimentally that, in contrast to the conventional view, sharp transmission resonances can be obtained from aperiodic aperture arrays. Terahertz transmission resonances are observed from several arrays in metallic films that exhibit unusual local n-fold rotational symmetries, where n = 10, 12, 18, 40 and 120. This is accomplished by using quasicrystals with long-range order, as well as a new type of 'quasicrystal approximates' in which the long-range order is somewhat relaxed. We find that strong transmission resonances also form in these aperiodic structures, at frequencies that closely match the discrete Fourier transform vectors in the aperture array structure factor. The shape of these resonances arises from Fano interference(4) of the discrete resonances and the non-resonant transmission band continuum related to the individual holes(5). Our approach expands potential design parameters for aperture arrays that are aperiodic but contain discrete Fourier transform vectors, and opens new avenues for optoelectronic devices.","Univ Utah, Dept Phys, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA; Univ Utah, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA","Vardeny, ZV (reprint author), Univ Utah, Dept Phys, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA.",nahata@ece.utah.edu; val@physics.utah.edu,"Agrawal, Amit/C-3728-2009; Matsui, Tatsunosuke/J-7916-2017","Agrawal, Amit/0000-0001-8230-4603; Matsui, Tatsunosuke/0000-0003-2179-9432",,,,21,216,217,8,118,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,29-Mar,2007,446,7135,,,,,517,521,,10.1038/nature05620,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,150TQ,WOS:000245242900044,17392781,No,Y,N,11/20/17

A full understanding of magnetism on the nanometre scale therefore calls for information on the arrangement of spins in real space and with atomic resolution. Spin-polarized scanning tunnelling microscopy accomplishes this(1) but can probe only conducting materials. Force microscopy can be used on any sample independent of its conductivity. In particular, magnetic force microscopy(2) is well suited to exploring ferromagnetic domain structures. However, atomic resolution cannot be achieved because data acquisition involves the sensing of long-range magnetostatic forces between tip and sample. Magnetic exchange force microscopy has been proposed(3) for overcoming this limitation: by using an atomic force microscope(4) with a magnetic tip, it should be possible to detect the short-range magnetic exchange force between tip and sample spins. Here we show for a prototypical antiferromagnetic insulator, the ( 001) surface of nickel oxide, that magnetic exchange force microscopy can indeed reveal the arrangement of both surface atoms and their spins simultaneously. In contrast with previous attempts to implement this method(5-8), we use an external magnetic field to align the magnetic polarization at the tip apex so as to optimize the interaction between tip and sample spins. This allows us to observe the direct magnetic exchange coupling between the spins of the tip atom and sample atom that are closest to each other, and thereby demonstrate the potential of magnetic exchange force microscopy for investigations of inter-spin interactions at the atomic level.","Univ Hamburg, Inst Appl Phys, D-20355 Hamburg, Germany; Univ Hamburg, Microstruct Res Ctr, D-20355 Hamburg, Germany","Schwarz, A (reprint author), Univ Hamburg, Inst Appl Phys, Jungiusstr 11, D-20355 Hamburg, Germany.",aschwarz@physnet.uni-hamburg.de,"Wiesendanger, Roland/P-9726-2016","Wiesendanger, Roland/0000-0002-0472-4183",,,,22,111,113,5,68,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,29-Mar,2007,446,7135,,,,,522,525,,10.1038/nature05617,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,150TQ,WOS:000245242900045,17392782,No,,,11/20/17

Although this technique became the definitive method for determining the absolute configuration of a molecule, one important limitation of the approach is that the molecule must contain 'heavy' atoms ( for example, bromine). The direct determination of absolute configurations for a wider range of molecules has recently become possible by measuring a molecule's vibrational optical activity(2,3). Here we show that instrumental advances in Raman optical activity(4,5), combined with quantum chemical computations(6-8), make it possible to determine the absolute configuration of ( R)-[H-2(1), H-2(2), H-2(3)]-neopentane(9). This saturated hydrocarbon represents the archetype of all molecules that are chiral as a result of a dissymmetric mass distribution. It is chemically inert and cannot be derivatized to yield molecules that would reveal the absolute configuration of the parent compound. Diastereomeric interactions with other molecules, optical rotation, and electronic circular dichroism are, in contrast to the well-known case of bromochlorofluoromethane(10-12), not expected to be measurable. Vibronic effects in the vacuum ultraviolet circular dichroism might reveal that the molecule is chiral, but the presence of nine rotamers would make it extremely difficult to interpret the spectra, because the spatial arrangement of the rotamers' nuclei resembles that of enantiomers. The unequivocal spectroscopic determination of the absolute configuration of ( R)-[H-2(1), H-2(2), H-2(3)]-neopentane therefore presented a major challenge, one that was at the very limit of what is possible.","Univ Fribourg, Dept Chem, CH-1700 Fribourg, Switzerland","Hug, W (reprint author), Univ Fribourg, Dept Chem, Ch Musee 9, CH-1700 Fribourg, Switzerland.",jacques.haesler@unifr.ch; w.hug@gmx.net,,,,,,28,135,136,0,39,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,29-Mar,2007,446,7135,,,,,526,529,,10.1038/nature05653,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,150TQ,WOS:000245242900046,17392783,No,,,11/20/17

A recent synthesis(2) suggests that the increase in global-mean surface temperature in response to a doubling of the atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration, termed 'climate sensitivity', is between 1.5 and 6.2 degrees C ( 5-95 per cent likelihood range), but some evidence is inconsistent with this range(1-5). Moreover, most estimates of climate sensitivity are based on records of climate change over the past few decades to thousands of years, when carbon dioxide concentrations and global temperatures were similar to or lower than today(1,6), so such calculations tend to underestimate the magnitude of large climate-change events(7) and may not be applicable to climate change under warmer conditions in the future. Here we estimate long-term equilibrium climate sensitivity by modelling carbon dioxide concentrations over the past 420 million years and comparing our calculations with a proxy record. Our estimates are broadly consistent with estimates based on short-term climate records, and indicate that a weak radiative forcing by carbon dioxide is highly unlikely on multi-million-year timescales. We conclude that a climate sensitivity greater than 1.5 degrees C has probably been a robust feature of the Earth's climate system over the past 420 million years, regardless of temporal scaling.","Wesleyan Univ, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, Middletown, CT 06459 USA; Yale Univ, Dept Geol & Geophys, New Haven, CT 06520 USA","Royer, DL (reprint author), Wesleyan Univ, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, Middletown, CT 06459 USA.",droyer@wesleyan.edu,,"Royer, Dana/0000-0003-0976-953X",,,,17,122,128,5,54,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,29-Mar,2007,446,7135,,,,,530,532,,10.1038/nature05699,,3,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,150TQ,WOS:000245242900047,17392784,No,,,11/20/17

This is especially true for the transmission of common infectious diseases ( such as influenza, measles, chickenpox and pertussis), and is of great relevance for host-parasite relationships in general(1-23). Here we gain further insights into the nonlinear dynamics of recurrent diseases through the analysis of the classical seasonally forced SIR ( susceptible, infectious or recovered) epidemic model(6,7). Ouranalysis differs from other modelling studies in that the focus is more on post-epidemic dynamics than the outbreak itself. Despite the mathematical intractability of the forced SIR model, we identify a new threshold effect and give clear analytical conditions for predicting the occurrence of either a future epidemic outbreak, or a 'skip'-a year in which an epidemic fails to initiate. The threshold is determined by the population's susceptibility measured after the last outbreak and the rate at which new susceptible individuals are recruited into the population. Moreover, the time of occurrence ( that is, the phase) of an outbreak proves to be a useful parameter that carries important epidemiological information. In forced systems, seasonal changes can prevent late-peaking diseases ( that is, those having high phase) from spreading widely, thereby increasing population susceptibility, and controlling the triggering and intensity of future epidemics. These principles yield forecasting tools that should have relevance for the study of newly emerging and re-emerging diseases controlled by seasonal vectors.","Tel Aviv Univ, Fac Life Sci, Dept Zool, Biomath Unit, IL-69978 Tel Aviv, Israel; Tel Aviv Univ, Porter Sch Environm Studies, IL-69978 Tel Aviv, Israel","Stone, L (reprint author), Tel Aviv Univ, Fac Life Sci, Dept Zool, Biomath Unit, IL-69978 Tel Aviv, Israel.",lewi@post.tau.ac.il,,,,,,30,136,143,0,48,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,29-Mar,2007,446,7135,,,,,533,536,,10.1038/nature05638,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,150TQ,WOS:000245242900048,17392785,No,,,11/20/17

Our understanding of how microorganisms adapt and evolve can be advanced by genome-wide documentation of the patterns of genetic exchange, particularly if analyses target coexisting members of natural communities. Here we use community genomic data sets to identify, with strain specificity, expressed proteins from the dominant member of a genomically uncharacterized, natural, acidophilic biofilm. Proteomics results reveal a genome shaped by recombination involving chromosomal regions of tens to hundreds of kilobases long that are derived from two closely related bacterial populations. Inter-population genetic exchange was confirmed by multilocus sequence typing of isolates and of uncultivated natural consortia. The findings suggest that exchange of large blocks of gene variants is crucial for the adaptation to specific ecological niches within the very acidic, metal-rich environment. Mass-spectrometry-based discrimination of expressed protein products that differ by as little as a single amino acid enables us to distinguish the behaviour of closely related coexisting organisms. This is important, given that microorganisms grouped together as a single species may have quite distinct roles in natural systems(1-3) and their interactions might be key to ecosystem optimization. Because proteomic data simultaneously convey information about genome type and activity, strain-resolved community proteomics is an important complement to cultivation-independent genomic ( metagenomic) analysis(4-6) of microorganisms in the natural environment.","Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; Oak Ridge Natl Lab, Oak Ridge, TN 37831 USA; Joint Genome Inst, Walnut Creek, CA 94598 USA; Lawrence Livermore Natl Lab, Livermore, CA 94550 USA","Banfield, JF (reprint author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",jbanfield@berkeley.edu,"Thelen, Michael/C-6834-2008; Tyson, Gene/C-6558-2013; Thelen, Michael/G-2032-2014; Hettich, Robert/N-1458-2016","Thelen, Michael/0000-0002-2479-5480; Thelen, Michael/0000-0002-2479-5480; Hettich, Robert/0000-0001-7708-786X",,,,25,164,169,1,50,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,29-Mar,2007,446,7135,,,,,537,541,,10.1038/nature05624,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,150TQ,WOS:000245242900049,17344860,No,,,11/20/17

Volatile pheromones are detected by odorant receptors expressed in olfactory receptor neurons ( ORNs). Whereas fruit odours typically activate multiple ORN classes(2), pheromones are thought to act through single dedicated classes of ORN3. This model predicts that activation of such an ORN class should be sufficient to trigger the appropriate behavioural response. Here we show that the Drosophila melanogaster male-specific pheromone 11-cis-vaccenyl acetate ( cVA) acts through the receptor Or67d to regulate both male and female mating behaviour. Mutant males that lack Or67d inappropriately court other males, whereas mutant females are less receptive to courting males. These data suggest that cVA has opposite effects in the two sexes: inhibiting mating behaviour in males but promoting mating behaviour in females. Replacing Or67d with moth pheromone receptors renders these ORNs sensitive to the corresponding moth pheromones. In such flies, moth pheromones elicit behavioural responses that mimic the normal response to cVA. Thus, activation of a single ORN class is both necessary and sufficient to mediate behavioural responses to the Drosophila sex pheromone cVA.","Res Inst Mol Pathol, A-1030 Vienna, Austria","Dickson, BJ (reprint author), Res Inst Mol Pathol, Dr Bohr Gasse 7, A-1030 Vienna, Austria.",dickson@imp.ac.at,,"Kozaric, Amina/0000-0002-6063-7260",,,,30,314,322,6,73,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,29-Mar,2007,446,7135,,,,,542,546,,10.1038/nature05672,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,150TQ,WOS:000245242900050,17392786,No,Y,N,11/20/17

Lymphoid organogenesis during embryonic life is dependent on molecules the temporal expression of which is tightly regulated. During this process, haematopoietic 'inducer' cells interact with stromal 'organizer' cells, giving rise to the lymphoid organ primordia(1). Here we show that the haematopoietic cells in the gut exhibit a random pattern of motility before aggregation into the primordia of Peyer's patches, a major component of the gut-associated lymphoid tissue. We further show that a CD45(+)CD4(-)CD3(-)Il7R alpha(-) c-Kit(+) CD11c(+) haematopoietic population expressing lymphotoxin has an important role in the formation of Peyer's patches. A subset of these cells expresses the receptor tyrosine kinase RET, which is essential for mammalian enteric nervous system formation(2). We demonstrate that RET signalling is also crucial for Peyer's patch formation. Functional genetic analysis revealed that Gfra3-deficiency results in impairment of Peyer's patch development, suggesting that the signalling axis RET/GFR alpha 3/ARTN is involved in this process. To support this hypothesis, we show that the RET ligand ARTN is a strong attractant of gut haematopoietic cells, inducing the formation of ectopic Peyer's patch-like structures. Our work strongly suggests that the RET signalling pathway, by regulating the development of both the nervous and lymphoid system in the gut, has a key role in the molecular mechanisms that orchestrate intestine organogenesis.","Natl Inst Med Res, MRC, Div Mol Immunol, London NW7 1AA, England; Natl Inst Med Res, MRC, Div Mol Neurobiol, London NW7 1AA, England","Kioussis, D (reprint author), Natl Inst Med Res, MRC, Div Mol Immunol, Ridgeway Mill Hill, London NW7 1AA, England.",dkiouss@nimr.mrc.ac.uk,,"Veiga-Fernandes, Henrique/0000-0001-6216-1836; Pachnis, Vassilis/0000-0001-9733-7686","Medical Research Council [G0601156, MC_U117512796, MC_U117537087]",,,33,129,132,0,11,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,29-Mar,2007,446,7135,,,,,547,551,,10.1038/nature05597,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,150TQ,WOS:000245242900051,17322904,No,,,11/20/17

Here we show that IEC-intrinsic I kappa B kinase ( IKK)-beta-dependent gene expression is a critical regulator of responses of dendritic cells and CD4(+) T cells in the GI tract. Mice with an IEC-specific deletion of IKK-beta show a reduced expression of the epithelial-cell-restricted cytokine thymic stromal lymphopoietin in the intestine and, after infection with the gut-dwelling parasite Trichuris, fail to develop a pathogen-specific CD4(+) T helper type 2 (T(H)2) response and are unable to eradicate infection. Further, these animals show exacerbated production of dendritic-cell-derived interleukin-12/23p40 and tumour necrosis factor-alpha, increased levels of CD4(+) T-cell-derived interferon-gamma and interleukin-17, and develop severe intestinal inflammation. Blockade of proinflammatory cytokines during Trichuris infection ablates the requirement for IKK-beta in IECs to promote CD4(+) T(H)2 cell-dependent immunity, identifying an essential function for IECs in tissue-specific conditioning of dendritic cells and limiting type 1 cytokine production in the GI tract.

The gut epithelium is critically involved in the maintenance of intestinal immune homeostasis-acting as a physical barrier separating luminal bacteria and immune cells, and also expressing antimicrobial peptides(3,5,6). However, the molecular mechanisms that control this function of gut epithelial cells are poorly understood. Here we show that the transcription factor NF kappa B, a master regulator of pro-inflammatory responses(7,8), functions in gut epithelial cells to control epithelial integrity and the interaction between the mucosal immune system and gut microflora. Intestinal epithelial-cell-specific inhibition of NF-kappa B through conditional ablation of NEMO ( also called I kappa B kinase-gamma ( IKK gamma)) or both IKK1 ( IKK alpha) and IKK2 ( IKK beta)-IKK subunits essential for NF-kappa B activation(7-9)-spontaneously caused severe chronic intestinal inflammation in mice. NF-kappa B deficiency led to apoptosis of colonic epithelial cells, impaired expression of antimicrobial peptides and translocation of bacteria into the mucosa. Concurrently, this epithelial defect triggered a chronic inflammatory response in the colon, initially dominated by innate immune cells but later also involving T lymphocytes. Deficiency of the gene encoding the adaptor protein MyD88 prevented the development of intestinal inflammation, demonstrating that Toll-like receptor activation by intestinal bacteria is essential for disease pathogenesis in this mouse model. Furthermore, NEMO deficiency sensitized epithelial cells to tumour-necrosis factor ( TNF)-induced apoptosis, whereas TNF receptor-1 inactivation inhibited intestinal inflammation, demonstrating that TNF receptor-1 signalling is crucial for disease induction. These findings demonstrate that a primary NF-kappa B signalling defect in intestinal epithelial cells disrupts immune homeostasis in the gastrointestinal tract, causing an inflammatory-bowel-disease-like phenotype. Our results identify NF-kappa B signalling in the gut epithelium as a critical regulator of epithelial integrity and intestinal immune homeostasis, and have important implications for understanding the mechanisms controlling the pathogenesis of human inflammatory bowel disease.","Univ Cologne, Inst Genet, D-50674 Cologne, Germany; EMBL, Mouse Biol Unit, I-00016 Monterotondo, Italy; Univ Mainz, Dept Med, Lab Clin Immunol 1, D-55131 Mainz, Germany; IRCCS Gastroenterol, Ist Clin Humanitas, Div Gastroenterol, I-20089 Milan, Italy; Univ Michigan, Dept Cell & Dev Biol, Ctr Organogenesis, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA","Pasparakis, M (reprint author), Univ Cologne, Inst Genet, Zulpicher Str 47, D-50674 Cologne, Germany.",pasparakis@uni-koeln.de,"van Loo, Geert/C-1505-2009; Becker, Christoph/A-6694-2008; Becker, Christoph/L-2996-2016; Pasparakis, Manolis/H-9292-2017","Becker, Christoph/0000-0002-1388-1041; Pasparakis, Manolis/0000-0002-9870-0966; Wullaert, Andy/0000-0001-5012-654X",,,,29,576,599,3,35,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,29-Mar,2007,446,7135,,,,,557,561,,10.1038/nature05698,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,150TQ,WOS:000245242900053,17361131,No,Y,N,11/20/17

The ubiquitin-proteasome system regulates selective protein degradation, in which the E3 ubiquitin ligases determine target specificity(2-4). Here we characterize a fat-soluble ligand-dependent ubiquitin ligase complex in human cell lines, in which dioxin receptor ( AhR)(5-9) is integrated as a component of a novel cullin 4B ubiquitin ligase complex, CUL4B(AhR). Complex assembly and ubiquitin ligase activity of CUL4B(AhR) in vitro and in vivo are dependent on the AhR ligand. In the CUL4B(AhR) complex, ligand-activated AhR acts as a substrate-specific adaptor component that targets sex steroid receptors for degradation.

Proteins in the lethal giant larvae protein family, including lethal giant larvae and tomosyn in metazoans and Sro7 in yeast, interact with Q-SNAREs and are emerging as key regulators of polarized exocytosis(3). The crystal structure of Sro7 reveals two seven-bladed WD40 beta-propellers followed by a 60-residue- long 'tail', which is bound to the surface of the amino-terminal propeller. Deletion of the Sro7 tail enables binding to the Qbc SNARE region of Sec9 and this interaction inhibits SNARE complex assembly. The N-terminal domain of Sec9 provides a second, high-affinity Sro7 interaction that is unaffected by the tail.

Access to genetic information encoded in chromosomes is dependent on the position of nucleosomes along the DNA. Alternative locations just a few nucleotides apart can have profound effects on gene expression(1). Yet the nucleosomal context in which chromosomal and gene regulatory elements reside remains ill-defined on a genomic scale. Here we sequence the DNA of 322,000 individual Saccharomyces cerevisiae nucleosomes, containing the histone variant H2A.Z, to provide a comprehensive map of H2A.Z nucleosomes in functionally important regions. With a median 4-base-pair resolution, we identify new and established signatures of nucleosome positioning. A single predominant rotational setting and multiple translational settings are evident. Chromosomal elements, ranging from telomeres to centromeres and transcriptional units, are found to possess characteristic nucleosomal architecture that may be important for their function. Promoter regulatory elements, including transcription factor binding sites and transcriptional start sites, show topological relationships with nucleosomes, such that transcription factor binding sites tend to be rotationally exposed on the nucleosome surface near its border. Transcriptional start sites tended to reside about one helical turn inside the nucleosome border. These findings reveal an intimate relationship between chromatin architecture and the underlying DNA sequence it regulates.","Penn State Univ, Ctr Comparat Genom & Bioinformat, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; Penn State Univ, Dept Biochem & Mol Biol, Ctr Gene Regulat, University Pk, PA 16802 USA","Pugh, BF (reprint author), Penn State Univ, Ctr Comparat Genom & Bioinformat, University Pk, PA 16802 USA.",bfp2@psu.edu,"QI, JI/E-2797-2016",,,,,30,423,436,0,14,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,29-Mar,2007,446,7135,,,,,572,576,,10.1038/nature05632,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,150TQ,WOS:000245242900056,17392789,No,,,11/20/17

Here, however, we use seismic imaging to show that the isotropic and anisotropic structure of the mantle is rotated beneath the East Pacific Rise. The isotropic structure defines the pattern of magma delivery from the mantle to the crust. We find that the segmentation of the rise crest between transform faults correlates well with the distribution of mantle melt. The azimuth of seismic anisotropy constrains the direction of mantle flow, which is rotated nearly 10 degrees anticlockwise from the plate-spreading direction. The mismatch between the locus of mantle melt delivery and the morphologic ridge axis results in systematic differences between areas of on-axis and off-axis melt supply. We conclude that the skew of asthenospheric upwelling and transport governs segmentation of the East Pacific Rise and variations in the intensity of ridge crest processes.","Univ Oregon, Dept Geol Sci, Eugene, OR 97403 USA; Nancy Univ, CRPG, F-54501 Vandoeuvre Les Nancy, France; Univ Hawaii, SOEST, Dept Geol & Geophys, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; Univ Washington, Sch Oceanog, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; Woods Hole Oceanog Inst, Dept Geol & Geophys, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA","Toomey, DR (reprint author), Univ Oregon, Dept Geol Sci, Eugene, OR 97403 USA.",drt@uoregon.edu,"Wright, Dawn/A-4518-2011; Dunn, Robert/L-9892-2014","Wright, Dawn/0000-0002-2997-7611; Dunn, Robert/0000-0003-1434-5512; Wilcock, William/0000-0001-7224-7246; Toomey, Douglas/0000-0003-2873-4084",,,,45,55,56,1,21,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,22-Mar,2007,446,7134,,,,,409,414,,10.1038/nature05679,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,148MO,WOS:000245079500033,17377578,No,,,11/20/17

The Yarkovsky effect has been observed directly 3, and there is also indirect evidence of its role in the orbital evolution of asteroids over long time intervals(4-6). So far, however, only indirect evidence exists for the YORP effect through the clustering of the directions of rotation axes in asteroid families(6-8). Here we report a change in the rotation rate of the asteroid 1862 Apollo, which is best explained by the YORP mechanism. The change is fairly large and clearly visible in photometric lightcurves, amounting to one extra rotation cycle in just 40 years even though Apollo's size is well over one kilometre.

The energy needed for this process is usually provided by heat, light, pressure or electrical potential, which act either by changing the distribution of the reactants on their ground-state potential energy surface or by moving them onto an excited-state potential energy surface and thereby facilitate movement over the energy barrier. A fundamentally different way of initiating or accelerating a reaction is the use of force to deform reacting molecules along a specific direction of the reaction coordinate. Mechanical force has indeed been shown to activate covalent bonds in polymers, but the usual result is chain scission(1). Here we show that mechanically sensitive chemical groups make it possible to harness the mechanical forces generated when exposing polymer solutions to ultrasound 2, and that this allows us to accelerate rearrangement reactions and bias reaction pathways to yield products not obtainable from purely thermal or light-induced reactions. We find that when placed within long polymer strands, the trans and cis isomers of a 1,2-disubstituted benzocyclobutene undergo an ultrasound-induced electrocyclic ring opening in a formally conrotatory and formally disrotatory process, respectively, that yield identical products. This contrasts with reaction initiation by light or heat alone 3, in which case the isomers follow mutually exclusive pathways to different products. Mechanical forces associated with ultrasound can thus clearly alter the shape of potential energy surfaces 4 so that otherwise forbidden or slow processes proceed under mild conditions, with the directionally specific nature of mechanical forces providing a reaction control that is fundamentally different from that achieved by adjusting chemical or physical parameters. Because rearrangement in our system occurs before chain scission, the effect we describe might allow the development of materials that are activated by mechanical stress fields.","Univ Illinois, Sch Chem Sci, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; Univ Illinois, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; Univ Illinois, Beckman Inst, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; Univ Illinois, Dept Aerosp Engn, Urbana, IL 61801 USA","Moore, JS (reprint author), Univ Illinois, Sch Chem Sci, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.",jsmoore@uiuc.edu,"Albe, Karsten/F-1139-2011","White, Scott/0000-0002-0831-9097",,,,16,394,403,15,169,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,22-Mar,2007,446,7134,,,,,423,427,,10.1038/nature05681,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,148MO,WOS:000245079500036,17377579,No,Y,N,11/20/17

Resolution of this issue has been hindered by uncertainties in estimates of basal traction, which controls the coupling between lithospheric plates and underlying mantle convection(2-4). Hotspot tracks preserve records of past plate motion(5) and provide markers with which the relative motion between a plate's surface and underlying mantle regions may be examined. Here we show that the 115-140-Myr surface expression of the Great Meteor hotspot track in eastern North America is misaligned with respect to its location at 200 km depth, as inferred from plate-reconstruction models and seismic tomographic studies(6). The misalignment increases with age and is consistent with westward displacement of the base of the plate relative to its surface, at an average rate of 3.8 +/- 1.8 mm yr(-1). Here age-constrained 'piercing points' have enabled direct estimation of relative motion between the surface and underside of a plate. The relative displacement of the base is approximately parallel to seismic fast axes and calculated mantle flow(7), suggesting that asthenospheric flow may be deforming the lithospheric keel and exerting a driving force on this part of the North American plate.","Univ Western Ontario, Dept Earth Sci, London, ON N6A 5B7, Canada; Univ Manitoba, Dept Geol Sci, Winnipeg, MB R3T 2N2, Canada","Eaton, DW (reprint author), Univ Western Ontario, Dept Earth Sci, London, ON N6A 5B7, Canada.",deaton@uwo.ca,,,,,,30,41,42,1,7,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,22-Mar,2007,446,7134,,,,,428,431,,10.1038/nature05675,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,148MO,WOS:000245079500037,17377580,No,,,11/20/17

Both resource competition and predation have been suggested as mechanisms driving this process(4,5), although the former is better studied than the latter(6,7). Here we show experimentally how predation by a protist, Tetrahymena thermophila, affects diversification in a model adaptive radiation of the bacterial prey, Pseudomonas fluorescens. We estimate the frequency-dependent fitness functions of competing niche-specialist prey in the presence and absence of predation, and use these to test hypotheses about the extent ( measured as the number of new genotypes) and rate of diversification. Competition and predation independently generated diversifying selection that we show is capable of driving prey diversification to similar extents but at different rates, diversification being markedly delayed in the presence of predators. The cause of this delay stems from weaker diversifying selection due to the reduction in prey density caused by predation. Our results suggest that predation may play an under-appreciated role in driving adaptive radiations.","Univ Ottawa, Dept Biol, Ottawa, ON K1N 6N5, Canada; Univ Ottawa, Ctr Adv Res Environm Genom, Ottawa, ON K1N 6N5, Canada","Meyer, JR (reprint author), Univ Ottawa, Dept Biol, Ottawa, ON K1N 6N5, Canada.",justin.raymond.meyer@gmail.com,,,,,,30,100,101,2,74,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,22-Mar,2007,446,7134,,,,,432,435,,10.1038/nature05599,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,148MO,WOS:000245079500038,17377581,No,,,11/20/17

When an ancestral bacterial genotype was introduced into a spatially structured habitat, it rapidly diversified into multiple niche-specialist types(5). However, diversification was suppressed when a niche-specialist type was introduced before, or shortly after, introduction of the ancestral genotype. In contrast, little suppression occurred when the same niche specialist was introduced relatively late. The negative impact of early arriving immigrants was attributable to the historically sensitive outcome of interactions involving neutral competition(3) and indirect facilitation. Ultimately, the entire boom-and-bust dynamics of adaptive radiation were altered. These results demonstrate that immigration and diversification are tightly linked processes, with small differences in immigration history greatly affecting the evolutionary emergence of diversity.","Univ Hawaii Manoa, Dept Zool, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; Univ Auckland, Sch Biol Sci, Auckland 1, New Zealand","Fukami, T (reprint author), Univ Hawaii Manoa, Dept Zool, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA.",tfukami@hawaii.edu,"Rainey, Paul/A-3207-2008; Fukami, Tadashi/A-2934-2010","Rainey, Paul/0000-0003-0879-5795; Fukami, Tadashi/0000-0001-5654-4785",,,,30,117,118,1,66,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,22-Mar,2007,446,7134,,,,,436,439,,10.1038/nature05629,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,148MO,WOS:000245079500039,17377582,No,,,11/20/17

Structurally, CNG channels are heterotetramers composed of either two or three homologue subunits(1-4). Although it is well established that activation is a cooperative process of these subunits(5), it remains unknown whether the cooperativity is generated by the ligand binding, the gating, or both, and how the subunits interact. In this study, the action of homotetrameric olfactory-type CNGA2 channels(6) was studied in inside-out membrane patches by simultaneously determining channel activation and ligand binding, using the fluorescent cGMP analogue 8-DY547-cGMP as the ligand. At concentrations of 8-DY547-cGMP <1 mu M, steady-state binding was larger than steady-state activation, whereas at higher concentrations it was smaller, generating a crossover of the steady-state relationships. Global analysis of these relationships together with multiple activation time courses following cGMP jumps(7) showed that four ligands bind to the channels and that there is significant interaction between the binding sites. Among the binding steps, the second is most critical for channel opening: its association constant is three orders of magnitude smaller than the others and it triggers a switch from a mostly closed to a maximally open state. These results contribute to unravelling the role of the subunits in the cooperative mechanism of CNGA2 channel activation and could be of general relevance for the action of other ion channels and receptors.","Univ Jena, Inst Physiol 2, D-07740 Jena, Germany; Fachhsch Schmalkalden, Fachbereich Elektrotech, D-98574 Schmalkalden, Germany; BIOLOG Life Sci Inst, D-28199 Bremen, Germany; Dyomics GmbH, D-07745 Jena, Germany; Leibniz Inst Mol Pharmakol, D-13125 Berlin, Germany","Benndorf, K (reprint author), Univ Jena, Inst Physiol 2, D-07740 Jena, Germany.",klaus.benndorf@mti.uni-jena.de,"Horstmann, Britta/C-2154-2008","Benndorf, Klaus/0000-0002-0707-4083",,,,30,63,64,1,9,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,22-Mar,2007,446,7134,,,,,440,443,,10.1038/nature05596,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,148MO,WOS:000245079500040,17322905,No,,,11/20/17

However, prolonged cardiac hypertrophy causes heart failure(2), and its mechanisms are largely unknown. Here we show that cardiac angiogenesis is crucially involved in the adaptive mechanism of cardiac hypertrophy and that p53 accumulation is essential for the transition from cardiac hypertrophy to heart failure. Pressure overload initially promoted vascular growth in the heart by hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (Hif-1)-dependent induction of angiogenic factors, and inhibition of angiogenesis prevented the development of cardiac hypertrophy and induced systolic dysfunction. Sustained pressure overload induced an accumulation of p53 that inhibited Hif-1 activity and thereby impaired cardiac angiogenesis and systolic function. Conversely, promoting cardiac angiogenesis by introducing angiogenic factors or by inhibiting p53 accumulation developed hypertrophy further and restored cardiac dysfunction under chronic pressure overload. These results indicate that the anti-angiogenic property of p53 may have a crucial function in the transition from cardiac hypertrophy to heart failure.","Chiba Univ, Grad Sch Med, Dept Cardiovasc Sci & Med, Chuo Ku, Chiba 2608670, Japan; RIKEN, Ctr Dev Biol, Kobe Inst Biomed Res & Innovat, Stem Cell Translat Res,Chuo Ku, Kobe, Hyogo 6500047, Japan; Sapporo Med Univ, Dept Mol Med, Chuo Ku, Sapporo, Hokkaido 0608556, Japan; Univ Tokushima, Inst Genome Res, Div Expt Immunol, Tokushima 7708503, Japan; Childrens Hosp, Med Ctr, Dept Pediat, Div Mol Cardiovasc Biol, Cincinnati, OH 45229 USA; Zhongshan Hosp, Shanghai Inst Cardiovasc Dis, Shanghai 200032, Peoples R China; Fudan Univ, Inst Biomed Sci, Shanghai 200032, Peoples R China","Komuro, I (reprint author), Chiba Univ, Grad Sch Med, Dept Cardiovasc Sci & Med, Chuo Ku, 1-8-1 Inohana, Chiba 2608670, Japan.",komuro-tky@umin.ac.jp,,"Minamino, Tohru/0000-0003-1627-6151",,,,24,453,467,3,36,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,22-Mar,2007,446,7134,,,,,444,448,,10.1038/nature05602,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,148MO,WOS:000245079500041,17334357,No,Y,N,11/20/17

The biosynthesis of the lower ligand of vitamin B-12, 5,6-dimethylbenzimidazole (DMB), is poorly understood(1-3). Recently, we discovered that a Sinorhizobium meliloti gene, bluB, is necessary for DMB biosynthesis(4). Here we show that BluB triggers the unprecedented fragmentation and contraction of the bound flavin mononucleotide cofactor and cleavage of the ribityl tail to form DMB and D-erythrose 4-phosphate. Our structural analysis shows that BluB resembles an NAD(P)H-flavin oxidoreductase, except that its unusually tight binding pocket accommodates flavin mononucleotide but not NAD( P) H. We characterize crystallographically an early intermediate along the reaction coordinate, revealing molecular oxygen poised over reduced flavin. Thus, BluB isolates and directs reduced flavin to activate molecular oxygen for its own cannibalization. This investigation of the biosynthesis of DMB provides clarification of an aspect of vitamin B-12 that was otherwise incomplete, and may contribute to a better understanding of vitamin B-12-related disease.","MIT, Dept Biol, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Biol Chem & Mol Pharmacol, Boston, MA 02115 USA","Walsh, CT (reprint author), MIT, Dept Biol, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",christopher_walsh@hms.harvard.edu,,/0000-0001-7243-8261,"NIGMS NIH HHS [R01 GM020011, R01 GM020011-30, R01 GM031030, R01 GM031030-25]",,,29,85,87,0,29,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,22-Mar,2007,446,7134,,,,,449,453,,10.1038/nature05611,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,148MO,WOS:000245079500042,17377583,No,,,11/20/17

Here we demonstrate an optical tweezer assay to measure the rupture force between a single ribosome complex and mRNA. The rupture force was compared between ribosome complexes assembled on an mRNA with and without a strong Shine-Dalgarno (SD) sequence - a sequence found just upstream of the coding region of bacterial mRNAs, involved in translation initiation(4,5). The removal of the SD sequence significantly reduced the rupture force in complexes carrying an aminoacyl tRNA, Phe-tRNA(Phe), in the A site, indicating that the SD interactions contribute significantly to the stability of the ribosomal complex on the mRNA before peptide bond formation. In contrast, the presence of a peptidyl tRNA analogue, N-acetyl-Phe-tRNA(Phe), in the A site, which mimicked the post-peptidyl transfer state, weakened the rupture force as compared to the complex with Phe-tRNA(Phe), and the resultant force was the same for both the SD-containing and SD-deficient mRNAs. These results suggest that formation of the first peptide bond destabilizes the SD interaction, resulting in the weakening of the force with which the ribosome grips an mRNA.

It is therefore of fundamental and medical importance to decipher cellular strategies for telomerase biogenesis, which will require new insights into how specific interactions occur in a precise order along the RNP assembly pathway. Here we use a single-molecule approach to dissect the individual assembly steps of telomerase. Direct observation of complex formation in real time revealed two sequential steps of protein-induced RNA folding, establishing a hierarchical RNP assembly mechanism: interaction with the telomerase holoenzyme protein p65 induces structural rearrangement of telomerase RNA, which in turn directs the binding of the telomerase reverse transcriptase to form the functional ternary complex. This hierarchical assembly process is facilitated by an evolutionarily conserved structural motif within the RNA.

Here we describe a Mesozoic eutriconodont nested within crown mammals that clearly illustrates this transition: the middle ear bones are connected to the mandible via an ossified Meckel's cartilage. The connected ear and jaw structure is similar to the embryonic pattern in modern monotremes (egg-laying mammals) and placental mammals, but is a paedomorphic feature retained in the adult, unlike in monotreme and placental adults. This suggests that reversal to (or retention of) this premammalian ancestral condition is correlated with different developmental timing (heterochrony) in eutriconodonts. This new eutriconodont adds to the evidence of homoplasy of vertebral characters in the thoraco-lumbar transition and unfused lumbar ribs among early mammals. This is similar to the effect of homeobox gene patterning of vertebrae in modern mammals, making it plausible to extrapolate the effects of Hox gene patterning to account for homoplastic evolution of vertebral characters in early mammals.","Carnegie Museum Nat Hist, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA; Nanjing Univ, Dept Earth Sci, Nanjing 210093, Peoples R China; Chinese Acad Sci, Nanjing Inst Geol & Palaeontol, State Key Lab Palaeobiol & Strat, Nanjing 210008, Peoples R China","Luo, ZX (reprint author), Carnegie Museum Nat Hist, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA.",luoz@carnegiemnh.org,,,,,,50,84,89,4,36,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,15-Mar,2007,446,7133,,,,,288,293,,10.1038/nature05627,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,145VC,WOS:000244892900038,17361176,No,,,11/20/17

The detection of this quantum feature requires a quantum non-demolition (QND) measurement(1-3) repeated many times during the system's evolution. Whereas quantum jumps of trapped massive particles ( electrons, ions or molecules(4-8)) have been observed, this has proved more challenging for light quanta. Standard photodetectors absorb light and are thus unable to detect the same photon twice. It is therefore necessary to use a transparent counter that can 'see' photons without destroying them(3). Moreover, the light needs to be stored for durations much longer than the QND detection time. Here we report an experiment in which we fulfil these challenging conditions and observe quantum jumps in the photon number. Microwave photons are stored in a superconducting cavity for times up to half a second, and are repeatedly probed by a stream of non-absorbing atoms. An atom interferometer measures the atomic dipole phase shift induced by the non-resonant cavity field, so that the final atom state reveals directly the presence of a single photon in the cavity. Sequences of hundreds of atoms, highly correlated in the same state, are interrupted by sudden state switchings. These telegraphic signals record the birth, life and death of individual photons. Applying a similar QND procedure to mesoscopic fields with tens of photons should open new perspectives for the exploration of the quantum-to-classical boundary(9,10).","Ecole Normale Super, Dept Phys, Lab Kastler Brossel, F-75231 Paris 05, France; Coll France, F-75231 Paris, France","Brune, M (reprint author), Ecole Normale Super, Dept Phys, Lab Kastler Brossel, 24 Rue Lhomond, F-75231 Paris 05, France.",brune@lkb.ens.fr,"Kuhr, Stefan/F-7296-2011; Deleglise, Samuel/B-1599-2015","Deleglise, Samuel/0000-0002-8680-5170; Hoff, Ulrich Busk/0000-0002-7122-8577",,,,23,246,253,4,65,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,15-Mar,2007,446,7133,,,,,297,300,,10.1038/nature05589,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,145VC,WOS:000244892900040,17361178,No,Y,N,11/20/17

Temporal resolution in the femtosecond or even attosecond range has been demonstrated, but spatial resolution is limited by diffraction to approximately half the wavelength of the light field (that is, several hundred nanometres). Theory has indicated(11,12) that the spatial limitation to coherent control can be overcome with the illumination of nanostructures: the spatial near-field distribution was shown to depend on the linear chirp of an irradiating laser pulse. An extension of this idea to adaptive control, combining multiparameter pulse shaping with a learning algorithm, demonstrated the generation of user-specified optical near-field distributions in an optimal and flexible fashion(13). Shaping of the polarization of the laser pulse 14,15 provides a particularly efficient and versatile nano-optical manipulation method(16,17). Here we demonstrate the feasibility of this concept experimentally, by tailoring the optical near field in the vicinity of silver nanostructures through adaptive polarization shaping of femtosecond laser pulses 14,15 and then probing the lateral field distribution by two-photon photoemission electron microscopy(18). In this combination of adaptive control(1-10) and nano-optics(19), we achieve subwave-length dynamic localization of electromagnetic intensity on the nanometre scale and thus overcome the spatial restrictions of conventional optics. This experimental realization of theoretical suggestions(11-13,16,17,20) opens a number of perspectives in coherent control, nano-optics, nonlinear spectroscopy, and other research fields in which optical investigations are carried out with spatial or temporal resolution.","Univ Wurzburg, Inst Phys, D-97074 Wurzburg, Germany; Tech Univ Kaiserslautern, Fachbereich Phys, D-67663 Kaiserslautern, Germany; Univ Kiel, Inst Expt & Angew Phys, D-24118 Kiel, Germany; Univ Bielefeld, Fak Phys, D-33516 Bielefeld, Germany; CSIC, Inst Opt, E-28006 Madrid, Spain","Brixner, T (reprint author), Univ Wurzburg, Inst Phys, D-97074 Wurzburg, Germany.",brixner@physik.uni-wuerzburg.de,"Aeschlimann, Martin/D-7141-2011; Pfeiffer, Walter/A-6378-2012; Garcia de Abajo, Javier/A-6095-2009; Bauer, Michael/G-5111-2016; Brixner, Tobias/S-1451-2016","Aeschlimann, Martin/0000-0003-3413-5029; Garcia de Abajo, Javier/0000-0002-4970-4565; Bauer, Michael/0000-0002-4391-9899; Brixner, Tobias/0000-0002-6529-704X",,,,30,355,359,7,138,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,15-Mar,2007,446,7133,,,,,301,304,,10.1038/nature05595,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,145VC,WOS:000244892900041,17361179,No,Y,N,11/20/17

The mechanism underlying the generation of tremor and its relationship to aseismic slip are, however, as yet unresolved.

Most previous geodynamic studies treat subduction zones as either infinite in trench-parallel extent(3,5,6) (that is, two-dimensional) or finite in width but fixed in space(7,16). Subduction zones and their associated slabs are, however, limited in lateral extent (250-7,400 km) and their three-dimensional geometry evolves over time. Here we show that slab width controls two first-order features of plate tectonics - the curvature of subduction zones and their tendency to retreat backwards with time. Using three-dimensional numerical simulations of free subduction, we show that trench migration rate is inversely related to slab width and depends on proximity to a lateral slab edge. These results are consistent with retreat velocities observed globally, with maximum velocities (6-16 cm yr(-1)) only observed close to slab edges (<1,200 km), whereas far from edges (>2,000 km) retreat velocities are always slow (<2.0 cm yr(-1)). Models with narrow slabs (<= 1,500 km) retreat fast and develop a curved geometry, concave towards the mantle wedge side. Models with slabs intermediate in width (similar to 2,000-3,000 km) are sublinear and retreat more slowly. Models with wide slabs (>= 4,000 km) are nearly stationary in the centre and develop a convex geometry, whereas trench retreat increases towards concave-shaped edges. Additionally, we identify periods (5-10 Myr) of slow trench advance at the centre of wide slabs. Such wide-slab behaviour may explain mountain building in the central Andes, as being a consequence of its tectonic setting, far from slab edges.","Australian Natl Univ, Res Sch Earth Sci, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia; Monash Univ, Sch Math Sci, Melbourne, Vic 3800, Australia","Schellart, WP (reprint author), Australian Natl Univ, Res Sch Earth Sci, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia.",wouter.schellart@anu.edu.au,"Moresi, Louis/H-1390-2011; Schellart, Wouter/A-1467-2008; Stegman, Dave/F-5794-2010; May, Dave/E-6381-2010","Moresi, Louis/0000-0003-3685-174X; May, Dave/0000-0003-2471-7498; Stegman, Dave/0000-0001-8012-6145; ",,,,30,288,292,6,56,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,15-Mar,2007,446,7133,,,,,308,311,,10.1038/nature05615,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,145VC,WOS:000244892900043,17361181,No,Y,N,11/20/17

By focusing attention on these ancient lines, this finding has re-written our understanding of angiosperm structural and reproductive biology, physiology, ecology and taxonomy(9-12). The discovery of a new basal lineage would lead to further re-evaluation of the initial angiosperm radiation, but would also be unexpected, as nearly all of the 460 flowering-plant families have been surveyed in molecular studies(10). Here we show that Hydatellaceae, a small family of dwarf aquatics that were formerly interpreted as monocots, are instead a highly modified and previously unrecognized ancient lineage of angiosperms. Molecular phylogenetic analyses of multiple plastid genes and associated noncoding regions from the two genera of Hydatellaceae identify this overlooked family as the sister group of Nymphaeales. This surprising result is further corroborated by evidence from the nuclear gene phytochrome C (PHYC), and by numerous morphological characters. This indicates that water lilies are part of a larger lineage that evolved more extreme and diverse modifications for life in an aquatic habitat than previously recognized.","Univ British Columbia, Fac Land & Food Syst, Ctr Biodivers Res, Plant Res Ctr, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada; Univ British Columbia, UBC Bot Garden, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada; Univ Calif Davis, Sect Evolut & Ecol, Davis, CA 95616 USA; Univ Zurich, Inst Systemat Bot, CH-8008 Zurich, Switzerland; Harvard Univ, Arnold Arboretum, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; Royal Bot Gardens, Sydney, NSW 2000, Australia","Graham, SW (reprint author), Univ British Columbia, Fac Land & Food Syst, Ctr Biodivers Res, Plant Res Ctr, 2357 Main Mall, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada.",swgraham@interchange.ubc.ca,"Graham, Sean/L-3944-2014; Mathews, Sarah/A-6513-2015","Graham, Sean/0000-0001-8209-5231; Mathews, Sarah/0000-0002-5518-7541",,,,31,148,162,1,39,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,15-Mar,2007,446,7133,,,,,312,315,,10.1038/nature05612,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,145VC,WOS:000244892900044,17361182,No,,,11/20/17

Other relevant genes therefore remain to be discovered. Recently a new BRCA2-binding protein, PALB2, was identified(4). The BRCA2-PALB2 interaction is crucial for certain key BRCA2 DNA damage response functions as well as its tumour suppression activity(4). Here we show, by screening for PALB2 mutations in Finland that a frameshift mutation, c.1592delT, is present at significantly elevated frequency in familial breast cancer cases compared with ancestry-matched population controls. The truncated PALB2 protein caused by this mutation retained little BRCA2-binding capacity and was deficient in homologous recombination and crosslink repair. Further screening of c.1592delT in unselected breast cancer individuals revealed a roughly fourfold enrichment of this mutation in patients compared with controls. Most of the mutation-positive unselected cases had a familial pattern of disease development. In addition, one multigenerational prostate cancer family that segregated the c.1592delT truncation allele was observed. These results indicate that PALB2 is a breast cancer susceptibility gene that, in a suitably mutant form, may also contribute to familial prostate cancer development.","Univ Kuopio, Inst Clin Med, FIN-70211 Kuopio, Finland; Karolinska Inst, Dept Biosci, SE-17177 Huddinge, Sweden; Karolinska Inst, Clin Res Ctr, SE-17177 Huddinge, Sweden; Univ Helsinki, Dept Med Genet, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland; Biomedicum Helsinki, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland; Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Charlestown, MA 02129 USA; Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Dept Pathol, Charlestown, MA 02129 USA; Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Ctr Canc, Charlestown, MA 02129 USA; Kuopio Univ Hosp, Dept Clin Pathol, FIN-70211 Kuopio, Finland; Univ Kuopio, Inst Clin Med Pathol & Forens Med, FIN-70211 Kuopio, Finland; Univ Tampere, Inst Med technol, Canc Genet Lab, FIN-33520 Tampere, Finland; Tampere Univ Hosp, Tampere, Finland; Dana Farber Canc Inst, Boston, MA 02115 USA; Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Boston, MA 02115 USA; Oulu Univ Hosp, FIN-90029 OYS, Finland; Univ Oulu, Dept Pathol, Oulu, Finland; Univ Oulu, Dept Oncol, Oulu, Finland; Univ Oulu, Dept Surg, Oulu, Finland; Univ Oulu, Dept Clin Genet, Oulu, Finland","Winqvist, R (reprint author), Kuopio Univ Hosp, Dept Oncol, FIN-70211 Kuopio, Finland.",david_livingston@dfci.harvard.edu; robert.winqvist@oulu.fi,"Kere, Juha/A-9179-2008; Aaltonen, Lauri/A-5375-2010; Drapkin, Ronny/E-9944-2016","Kere, Juha/0000-0003-1974-0271; Aaltonen, Lauri/0000-0001-6839-4286; Drapkin, Ronny/0000-0002-6912-6977; Kallioniemi, Anne/0000-0003-3552-8158; Kataja, Vesa/0000-0003-4846-4843",,,,16,252,256,5,25,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,15-Mar,2007,446,7133,,,,,316,319,,10.1038/nature05609,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,145VC,WOS:000244892900045,17287723,No,,,11/20/17

Previous work(4) has defined three domains, the medullary zone, the cortical zone and the posterior signalling centre (PSC), within the developing third-instar lymph gland. The medullary zone is populated by a core of undifferentiated, slowly cycling progenitor cells, whereas mature haemocytes comprising plasmatocytes, crystal cells and lamellocytes are peripherally located in the cortical zone. The PSC comprises a third region that was first defined as a small group of cells expressing the Notch ligand Serrate(5). Here we show that the PSC is specified early in the embryo by the homeotic gene Antennapedia (Antp) and expresses the signalling molecule Hedgehog. In the absence of the PSC or the Hedgehog signal, the precursor population of the medullary zone is lost because cells differentiate prematurely. We conclude that the PSC functions as a haematopoietic niche that is essential for the maintenance of blood cell precursors in Drosophila.

Larval haematopoietic progenitors (prohaemocytes) give rise to three types of circulating haemocytes: plasmatocytes, crystal cells and lamellocytes. Lamellocytes, which are devoted to encapsulation of large foreign bodies, only differentiate in response to specific immune threats, such as parasitization by wasps. Here we show that a small cluster of signalling cells, termed the PSC ( posterior signalling centre)(1), controls the balance between multipotent prohaemocytes and differentiating haemocytes, and is necessary for the massive differentiation of lamellocytes that follows parasitization. Communication between the PSC and haematopoietic progenitors strictly depends on the PSC-restricted expression of Collier, the Drosophila orthologue of mammalian early B-cell factor. PSC cells act, in a non-cell-autonomous manner, to maintain JAK/STAT signalling activity in prohaemocytes, preventing their premature differentiation. Serrate-mediated Notch signalling from the PSC is required to maintain normal levels of col transcription. The key role of the PSC in controlling blood cell homeostasis is reminiscent of interactions between haematopoietic progenitors and their microenvironment in vertebrates(2 - 4), thus further highlighting the interest of Drosophila as a model system for studying the evolution of haematopoiesis and cellular innate immunity.","Univ Toulouse 3, CNRS, UMR 5547, Ctr Dev Biol, F-31062 Toulouse 09, France; Univ Toulouse 3, CNRS, IFR 109, Ctr Dev Biol, F-31062 Toulouse, France; Jagiellonian Univ, Inst Zool, PL-30060 Krakow, Poland; CNRS, UPR 9022, IBMC, F-67084 Strasbourg, France","Crozatier, M (reprint author), Univ Toulouse 3, CNRS, UMR 5547, Ctr Dev Biol, 118 Route Narbonne, F-31062 Toulouse 09, France.",crozat@cict.fr,"Makki, Rami/F-9236-2012",,,,,28,160,167,2,17,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,15-Mar,2007,446,7133,,,,,325,328,,10.1038/nature05650,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,145VC,WOS:000244892900047,17361184,No,,,11/20/17

One particular 14-3-3 isoform, sigma, is a p53-responsive gene, the function of which is frequently lost in human tumours, including breast and prostate cancers as a result of either hypermethylation of the 14-3-3 sigma promoter or induction of an oestrogen-responsive ubiquitin ligase that specifically targets 14-3-3 sigma for proteasomal degradation(1-9). Loss of 14-3-3 sigma protein occurs not only within the tumours themselves but also in the surrounding pre-dysplastic tissue (so-called field cancerization), indicating that 14-3-3 sigma might have an important tumour suppressor function that becomes lost early in the process of tumour evolution(3,9). The molecular basis for the tumour suppressor function of 14-3-3 sigma is unknown. Here we report a previously unknown function for 14-3-3 sigma as a regulator of mitotic translation through its direct mitosis-specific binding to a variety of translation/ initiation factors, including eukaryotic initiation factor 4B in a stoichiometric manner. Cells lacking 14-3-3 sigma, in marked contrast to normal cells, cannot suppress cap-dependent translation and do not stimulate cap-independent translation during and immediately after mitosis. This defective switch in the mechanism of translation results in reduced mitotic-specific expression of the endogenous internal ribosomal entry site (IRES)-dependent form of the cyclin-dependent kinase Cdk11 (p58 PITSLRE), leading to impaired cytokinesis, loss of Polo-like kinase-1 at the midbody, and the accumulation of binucleate cells. The aberrant mitotic phenotype of 14-3-3 sigma-depleted cells can be rescued by forced expression of p58 PITSLRE or by extinguishing cap-dependent translation and increasing cap-independent translation during mitosis by using rapamycin. Our findings show how aberrant mitotic translation in the absence of 14-3-3 sigma impairs mitotic exit to generate binucleate cells and provides a potential explanation of how 14-3-3 sigma-deficient cells may progress on the path to aneuploidy and tumorigenesis.","MIT, Ctr Canc Res, Dept Biol, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; McGill Univ, McGill Canc Ctr, Dept Biochem, Montreal, PQ H3G 1Y6, Canada","Yaffe, MB (reprint author), MIT, Ctr Canc Res, Dept Biol, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",myaffe@mit.edu,,"Huang, Paul/0000-0003-3972-5087; White, Forest/0000-0002-1545-1651",,,,30,141,149,1,12,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,15-Mar,2007,446,7133,,,,,329,332,,10.1038/nature05584,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,145VC,WOS:000244892900048,17361185,No,,,11/20/17

Ubiquitination requires an activating enzyme (E1), a conjugating enzyme (E2) and a ligase (E3)(2). Most ubiquitin ligases use either a HECT (homologous to E6-associated protein C terminus) or a RING (really interesting new gene) domain to catalyse polyubiquitination(3), but the mechanism of E3 catalysis is poorly defined(4). Here we dissect this process using mouse Ube2g2 (E2; identical at the amino acid level to human Ube2g2) and human gp78 (E3), an endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-associated conjugating system essential for the degradation of misfolded ER proteins(5,6). We demonstrate by expressing recombinant proteins in Escherichia coli that Ube2g2/gp78-mediated polyubiquitination involves preassembly of Lys48-linked ubiquitin chains at the catalytic cysteine of Ube2g2. The growth of Ube2g2-anchored ubiquitin chains seems to be mediated by an aminolysis-based transfer reaction between two Ube2g2 molecules that each carries a ubiquitin moiety in its active site. Intriguingly, polyubiquitination of a substrate can be achieved by transferring preassembled ubiquitin chains from Ube2g2 to a lysine residue in a substrate.","NIDDKD, Mol Biol Lab, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; Stanford Univ, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Dept Mol & Cellular Physiol Neurol & Neurol Sci S, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; Stanford Univ, SSRL, Stanford, CA 94305 USA","Ye, YH (reprint author), NIDDKD, Mol Biol Lab, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA.",yihongy@mail.nih.gov,,"Brunger, Axel/0000-0001-5121-2036",Intramural NIH HHS,,,26,146,149,2,20,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,15-Mar,2007,446,7133,,,,,333,337,,10.1038/nature05542,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,145VC,WOS:000244892900049,17310145,No,,,11/20/17

Shortly after that, the CIA-histone-H3-H4 complex was isolated from Drosophila as a histone chaperone CAF-1 stimulator(2). Human CIA-I/II (ASF1a/b) was identified as a histone chaperone that interacts with the bromodomain - an acetylated-histone-recognizing domain - of CCG1, in the general transcription initiation factor TFIID3-5. Intensive studies have revealed that CIA/ASF1 mediates nucleosome assembly by forming a complex with another histone chaperone in human cells 6 and yeast 7, and is involved in DNA replication 1,2, transcription 4,8 - 10, DNA repair 1,2,11,12 and silencing/ anti-silencing(1,2,8,13-15) in yeast. CIA/ASF1 was shown as a major storage chaperone for soluble histones in proliferating human cells(6,16). Despite all these biochemical and biological functional analyses, the structure - function relationship of the nucleosome assembly/disassembly activity of CIA/ASF1 has remained elusive. Here we report the crystal structure, at 2.7 angstrom resolution, of CIA-I in complex with histones H3 and H4. The structure shows the histone H3 - H4 dimer's mutually exclusive interactions with another histone H3 - H4 dimer and CIA-I. The carboxy-terminal beta-strand of histone H4 changes its partner from the beta-strand in histone H2A to that of CIA-I through large conformational change. In vitro functional analysis demonstrated that CIA-I has a histone H3 - H4 tetramer-disrupting activity. Mutants with weak histone H3-H4 dimer binding activity showed critical functional effects on cellular processes related to transcription. The histone H3-H4 tetramer-disrupting activity of CIA/ASF1 and the crystal structure of the CIA/ASF1-histone-H3-H4 dimer complex should give insights into mechanisms of both nucleosome assembly/disassembly and nucleosome semi-conservative replication.","Natl Inst Adv Ind Sci & Technol, Biol Informat Res Ctr, Koto Ku, Tokyo 1350064, Japan; JST, ERATO, Horikoshi Gene Selector Project, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3002635, Japan; Univ Tokyo, Inst Mol & Cellular Biosci, Dev Biol Lab, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo 1130032, Japan; JBIC, JBIRC, Koto Ku, Tokyo 1350064, Japan","Senda, T (reprint author), Natl Inst Adv Ind Sci & Technol, Biol Informat Res Ctr, Koto Ku, 2-42 Aomi, Tokyo 1350064, Japan.",horikosh@iam.u-tokyo.ac.jp; tsenda@jbirc.aist.go.jp,,,,,,30,184,186,0,12,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,15-Mar,2007,446,7133,,,,,338,341,,10.1038/nature05613,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,145VC,WOS:000244892900050,17293877,No,,,11/20/17

Here we report more than 1,000 somatic mutations found in 274 megabases (Mb) of DNA corresponding to the coding exons of 518 protein kinase genes in 210 diverse human cancers. There was substantial variation in the number and pattern of mutations in individual cancers reflecting different exposures, DNA repair defects and cellular origins. Most somatic mutations are likely to be 'passengers' that do not contribute to oncogenesis. However, there was evidence for 'driver' mutations contributing to the development of the cancers studied in approximately 120 genes.

The liberation of gravitational potential energy then brightens these systems by up to 100-fold every few weeks or months(2). Thermonuclear-powered eruptions thousands of times more luminous(3,4) occur in classical novae(5), accompanied by significant mass ejection(6) and formation of clearly visible shells(7,8) from the ejected material. Theory predicts that the white dwarfs in all dwarf novae must eventually accrete enough mass to undergo classical nova eruptions(9). Here we report a shell, an order of magnitude more extended than those detected around many classical novae, surrounding the prototypical dwarf nova Z Camelopardalis. The derived shell mass matches that of classical novae, and is inconsistent with the mass expected from a dwarf nova wind or a planetary nebula.

These sediments appear to have experienced diagenetic modification in the presence of a fluctuating water table(3-5). In addition to the extensive secondary aqueous alteration, the primary grains themselves probably derive from earlier playa evaporites(1,2,4). Little is known, however, about the hydrologic processes responsible for this environmental history - particularly how such extensive evaporite deposits formed in the absence of a topographic basin. Here we investigate the origin of these deposits, in the context of the global hydrology of early Mars, using numerical simulations, and demonstrate that Meridiani is one of the few regions of currently exposed ancient crust predicted to have experienced significant groundwater upwelling and evaporation. The global groundwater flow would have been driven primarily by precipitation-induced recharge and evaporative loss, with the formation of the Tharsis volcanic rise possibly playing a role through the burial of aquifers and induced global deformation. These results suggest that the deposits formed as a result of sustained groundwater upwelling and evaporation, rather than ponding within an enclosed basin. The evaporite formation coincided with a transition to more arid conditions(6) that increased the relative impact of a deep-seated, global-scale hydrology on the surface evolution.","Washington Univ, McDonnell Ctr Space Sci, St Louis, MO 63130 USA; Washington Univ, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, St Louis, MO 63130 USA; MIT, Dept Earth Atmospher & Planetary Sci, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA","Andrews-Hanna, JC (reprint author), MIT, Dept Earth Atmospher & Planetary Sci, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",jhanna@mit.edu,,,,,,30,139,140,1,20,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,8-Mar,2007,446,7132,,,,,163,166,,10.1038/nature05594,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,143JS,WOS:000244718100035,17344848,No,,,11/20/17

Here we combine artificial atoms to create a highly correlated electron system within a nano-engineered semiconductor structure(4). We tune the system in situ through a quantum phase transition between two distinct states, each a version of the Kondo state(5), in which a bound electron interacts with surrounding mobile electrons.

Solid silicon has recently been generated directly from silica at much lower temperatures (<= 850 degrees C) via electrochemical reduction in molten salts(2,3). However, the silicon products of such electrochemical reduction did not retain the microscale morphology of the starting silica reactants(2,3). Here we demonstrate a low-temperature ( 650 degrees C) magnesiothermic reduction process for converting three-dimensional nanostructured silica micro-assemblies into microporous nanocrystalline silicon replicas. The intricate nanostructured silica microshells (frustules) of diatoms ( unicellular algae) were converted into co-continuous, nanocrystalline mixtures of silicon and magnesia by reaction with magnesium gas. Selective magnesia dissolution then yielded an interconnected network of silicon nanocrystals that retained the starting three-dimensional frustule morphology. The silicon replicas possessed a high specific surface area (>500 m(2) g(-1)), and contained a significant population of micropores (<= 20 angstrom). The silicon replicas were photoluminescent, and exhibited rapid changes in impedance upon exposure to gaseous nitric oxide ( suggesting a possible application in microscale gas sensing). This process enables the syntheses of microporous nanocrystalline silicon microassemblies with multifarious three-dimensional shapes inherited from biological(4-6) or synthetic silica templates(7-9) for sensor, electronic, optical or biomedical applications(10-13).","Georgia Inst Technol, Sch Mat Sci & Engn, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA","Sandhage, KH (reprint author), Georgia Inst Technol, Sch Mat Sci & Engn, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA.",ken.sandhage@mse.gatech.edu,"Liu, Meilin/E-5782-2010; Shian, Samuel/H-3168-2013","Liu, Meilin/0000-0002-6188-2372; ",,,,29,404,416,28,391,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,8-Mar,2007,446,7132,,,,,172,175,,10.1038/nature05570,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,143JS,WOS:000244718100037,17344850,No,Y,N,11/20/17

However, the early glaciation history of the Northern Hemisphere is a subject of controversy(3,7-9). Here we report stratigraphically extensive ice-rafted debris, including macroscopic dropstones, in late Eocene to early Oligocene sediments from the Norwegian - Greenland Sea that were deposited between about 38 and 30 million years ago. Our data indicate sediment rafting by glacial ice, rather than sea ice, and point to East Greenland as the likely source. Records of this type from one site alone cannot be used to determine the extent of ice involved.

This condition has been suggested to represent a key adaptation for flight in birds, by reducing the metabolic costs associated with having large genome and cell sizes(3,4). However, the evolution of genome architecture in birds, or any other lineage, is difficult to study because genomic information is often absent for long-extinct relatives. Here we use a novel bayesian comparative method to show that bone-cell size correlates well with genome size in extant vertebrates, and hence use this relationship to estimate the genome sizes of 31 species of extinct dinosaur, including several species of extinct birds. Our results indicate that the small genomes typically associated with avian flight evolved in the saurischian dinosaur lineage between 230 and 250 million years ago, long before this lineage gave rise to the first birds. By comparison, ornithischian dinosaurs are inferred to have had much larger genomes, which were probably typical for ancestral Dinosauria. Using comparative genomic data, we estimate that genome-wide interspersed mobile elements, a class of repetitive DNA, comprised 5 - 12% of the total genome size in the saurischian dinosaur lineage, but was 7 - 19% of total genome size in ornithischian dinosaurs, suggesting that repetitive elements became less active in the saurischian lineage.

In the hippocampus, this neuronal pattern separation is expressed as the tendency of ensembles of place cells 6 to undergo extensive 'remapping' in response to changes in the sensory or motivational inputs to the hippocampus(7-13). Remapping is expressed under some conditions as a change of firing rates in the presence of a stable place code ('rate remapping')(14), and under other conditions as a complete reorganization of the hippocampal place code in which both place and rate of firing take statistically independent values ('global remapping')(14). Here we show that the nature of hippocampal remapping can be predicted by ensemble dynamics in place-selective grid cells in the medial entorhinal cortex(15,16), one synapse upstream of the hippocampus. Whereas rate remapping is associated with stable grid fields, global remapping is always accompanied by a coordinate shift in the firing vertices of the grid cells. Grid fields of co-localized medial entorhinal cortex cells move and rotate in concert during this realignment. In contrast to the multiple environment-specific representations coded by place cells in the hippocampus, local ensembles of grid cells thus maintain a constant spatial phase structure, allowing position to be represented and updated by the same translation mechanism in all environments encountered by the animal.","Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Ctr Biol Memmory, NO-7489 Trondheim, Norway; SISSA, Int Sch Adv Studies, Cognit Neurosci Sector, I-34014 Trieste, Italy","Moser, EI (reprint author), Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Ctr Biol Memmory, NO-7489 Trondheim, Norway.",edvard.moser@ntnu.no,"Treves, Alessandro/B-2318-2009","TREVES, Alessandro/0000-0001-7246-5673; Hafting, Torkel/0000-0002-0928-3487",,,,30,272,280,2,59,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,8-Mar,2007,446,7132,,,,,190,194,,10.1038/nature05601,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,143JS,WOS:000244718100041,17322902,No,,,11/20/17

Here we show that the soluble cytosolic carboxy terminus of an oligomeric ammonium transporter from Arabidopsis thaliana serves as an allosteric regulator essential for function; mutations in the C-terminal domain, conserved between bacteria, fungi and plants, led to loss of transport activity. When co-expressed with intact transporters, mutants inactivated functional subunits, but left their stability unaffected. Co-expression of two inactive transporters, one with a defective pore, the other with an ablated C terminus, reconstituted activity. The crystal structure of an Archaeoglobus fulgidus ammonium transporter (AMT)(1) suggests that the C terminus interacts physically with cytosolic loops of the neighbouring subunit. Phosphorylation of conserved sites in the C terminus(2) are proposed as the cognate control mechanism. Conformational coupling between monomers provides a mechanism for tight regulation, for increasing the dynamic range of sensing and memorizing prior events, and may be a general mechanism for transporter regulation.","Carnegie Inst Washington, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; Univ Hohenheim, Inst Plant Nutr, D-70593 Stuttgart, Germany","Frommer, WB (reprint author), Carnegie Inst Washington, 290 Panama St, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",wfrommer@stanford.edu,"Frommer, Wolf B/A-8256-2008; Loque, Dominique/A-8153-2008; Frommer, Wolf/K-5042-2017","Frommer, Wolf/0000-0001-6465-0115; von Wiren, Nicolaus/0000-0002-4966-425X",,,,30,134,143,2,28,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,8-Mar,2007,446,7132,,,,,195,198,,10.1038/nature05579,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,143JS,WOS:000244718100042,17293878,No,,,11/20/17

Which tissue system drives or restricts growth has been a subject of debate for over a century(1-4). Here, we use dwarf, brassinosteroid biosynthesis and brassinosteroid response mutants in conjunction with tissue-specific expression of these components as tools to examine the role of the epidermis in shoot growth. We show that expression of the brassinosteroid receptor or a brassinosteroid biosynthetic enzyme in the epidermis, but not in the vasculature, of null mutants is sufficient to rescue their dwarf phenotypes. Brassinosteroid signalling from the epidermis is not sufficient to establish normal vascular organization.

C5L2 ( also known as GPR77) is a relatively new GPCR thought to be a non-signalling receptor binding to C5a, on the basis of sequence information and experimental evidence(5-7). Here we show, using gene targeting, that C5L2 is required to facilitate C5a signalling in neutrophils, macrophages and fibroblasts in vitro. Deficiency of C5L2 results in reduced inflammatory cell infiltration, suggesting that C5L2 is critical for optimal C5a-mediated cell infiltration in certain in vivo settings. C5L2 is also involved in optimizing C3a-induced signals. Furthermore, like mice incapable of C3a/complement 3a receptor (C3aR) signalling(4,8,9), C5L2-deficient mice are hypersensitive to lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced septic shock, show reduced ovalbumin (OVA)-induced airway hyperresponsiveness and inflammation, and are mildly delayed in haematopoietic cell regeneration after gamma-irradiation.

The average human genome contains similar to 80-100 retrotransposition- competent L1s (ref. 2), and they mobilize by a process that uses both the L1 endonuclease and reverse transcriptase, termed target-site primed reverse transcription(3-5). We have previously reported an efficient, endonuclease-independent L1 retrotransposition pathway (EN(i)) in certain Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell lines that are defective in the non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) pathway of DNA double-strand-break repair(6). Here we have characterized EN(i) retrotransposition events generated in V3 CHO cells, which are deficient in DNA-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit (DNA-PKcs) activity and have both dysfunctional telomeres and an NHEJ defect. Notably, similar to 30% of EN(i) retrotransposition events insert in an orientation-specific manner adjacent to a perfect telomere repeat (5'-TTAGGG-3'). Similar insertions were not detected among EN(i) retrotransposition events generated in controls or in XR-1 CHO cells deficient for XRCC4, an NHEJ factor that is required for DNA ligation but has no known function in telomere maintenance. Furthermore, transient expression of a dominant-negative allele of human TRF2 ( also called TERF2) in XRCC4-deficient XR-1 cells, which disrupts telomere capping, enables telomere-associated EN(i) retrotransposition events. These data indicate that L1s containing a disabled endonuclease can use dysfunctional telomeres as an integration substrate. The findings highlight similarities between the mechanism of EN(i) retrotransposition and the action of telomerase, because both processes can use a 3' OH for priming reverse transcription at either internal DNA lesions or chromosome ends(7,8). Thus, we propose that EN(i) retrotransposition is an ancestral mechanism of RNA-mediated DNA repair associated with non-LTR retrotransposons that may have been used before the acquisition of an endonuclease domain.","Univ Michigan, Dept Human Genet, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; Univ Michigan, Dept Internal Med, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; Lankenau Inst Med Res, Wynnewood, PA 19096 USA; Boston Univ, Sch Med, Dept Microbiol, Boston, MA 02118 USA","Moran, JV (reprint author), Univ Michigan, Dept Human Genet, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",morrisht@jhmi.edu; moranj@umich.edu,,"Morrish, Tammy/0000-0002-6725-0253; Sekiguchi, JoAnn/0000-0002-7178-4258",,,,30,92,96,0,4,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,8-Mar,2007,446,7132,,,,,208,212,,10.1038/nature05560,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,143JS,WOS:000244718100045,17344853,No,,,11/20/17

A detailed understanding of their mechanisms requires direct visualization at high resolution and in distinct conformations. Our recent structure of the multidrug ABC exporter Sav1866 has revealed an outward-facing conformation of the transmembrane domains coupled to a closed conformation of the nucleotide-binding domains, reflecting the ATP-bound state(5). Here we present the 3.1 angstrom crystal structure of a putative molybdate transporter (ModB(2)C(2)) from Archaeoglobus fulgidus in complex with its binding protein ( ModA). Twelve transmembrane helices of the ModB subunits provide an inward-facing conformation, with a closed gate near the external membrane boundary. The ATP-hydrolysing ModC subunits reveal a nucleotide-free, open conformation, whereas the attached binding protein aligns the substrate-binding cleft with the entrance to the presumed translocation pathway. Structural comparison of ModB(2)C(2)A with Sav1866 suggests a common alternating access and release mechanism, with binding of ATP promoting an outward-facing conformation and dissociation of the hydrolysis products promoting an inward-facing conformation.","ETH, Inst Mol Biol & Biophys, CH-8093 Zurich, Switzerland","Locher, KP (reprint author), ETH, Inst Mol Biol & Biophys, CH-8093 Zurich, Switzerland.",kaspar.locher@mol.biol.ethz.ch,,,,,,30,315,328,2,67,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,8-Mar,2007,446,7132,,,,,213,216,,10.1038/nature05626,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,143JS,WOS:000244718100046,17322901,No,Y,N,11/20/17

Here we report a combination of switch-like and graded pathway responses leading to stochastic phenotype determination in a specific range of pheromone concentrations. Furthermore, we show that these responses are critically dependent on mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)-mediated regulation of the activity of the pheromone-response-specific transcription factor, Ste12, as well as on the autoregulatory feedback of Ste12. In particular, both the switch-like characteristics and sensitivity of gene expression in shmooing cells to pheromone concentration were significantly diminished in cells lacking Kss1, one of the MAP kinases activated in the mating pathway. In addition, the dynamic range of gradient sensing of Kss1-deficient cells was reduced compared with wild type.

The origin of localization is interference between multiple scatterings of the electron by random defects in the potential, altering the eigenmodes from being extended ( Bloch waves) to exponentially localized(2). As a result, the material is transformed from a conductor to an insulator. Anderson's work dates back to 1958, yet strong localization has never been observed in atomic crystals, because localization occurs only if the potential ( the periodic lattice and the fluctuations superimposed on it) is time-independent. However, in atomic crystals important deviations from the Anderson model always occur, because of thermally excited phonons and electron - electron interactions. Realizing that Anderson localization is a wave phenomenon relying on interference, these concepts were extended to optics(3,4). Indeed, both weak(5-7,31) and strong(8-11) localization effects were experimentally demonstrated, traditionally by studying the transmission properties of randomly distributed optical scatterers ( typically suspensions or powders of dielectric materials). However, in these studies the potential was fully random, rather than being 'frozen' fluctuations on a periodic potential, as the Anderson model assumes. Here we report the experimental observation of Anderson localization in a perturbed periodic potential: the transverse localization of light caused by random fluctuations on a two-dimensional photonic lattice. We demonstrate how ballistic transport becomes diffusive in the presence of disorder, and that crossover to Anderson localization occurs at a higher level of disorder. Finally, we study how nonlinearities affect Anderson localization. As Anderson localization is a universal phenomenon, the ideas presented here could also be implemented in other systems ( for example, matter waves), thereby making it feasible to explore experimentally long-sought fundamental concepts, and bringing up a variety of intriguing questions related to the interplay between disorder and nonlinearity.","Technion Israel Inst Technol, Dept Phys, IL-32000 Haifa, Israel","Segev, M (reprint author), Technion Israel Inst Technol, Dept Phys, IL-32000 Haifa, Israel.",msegev@tx.technion.ac.il,"Schwartz, Tal/C-1689-2014; Fishman, Shmuel/O-4404-2016","Schwartz, Tal/0000-0002-5022-450X; Fishman, Shmuel/0000-0003-2119-859X",,,,31,747,752,15,130,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,1-Mar,2007,446,7131,,,,,52,55,,10.1038/nature05623,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,140RY,WOS:000244525600034,17330037,No,Y,N,11/20/17

Other unusual phenomena, like the finite conductivity of order 4e(2)/h ( where e is the electron charge and h is Planck's constant) at the charge neutrality ( or Dirac) point(2), have come as a surprise and remain to be explained(5-13). Here we experimentally study the Josephson effect(14) in mesoscopic junctions consisting of a graphene layer contacted by two closely spaced superconducting electrodes(15). The charge density in the graphene layer can be controlled by means of a gate electrode. We observe a supercurrent that, depending on the gate voltage, is carried by either electrons in the conduction band or by holes in the valence band. More importantly, we find that not only the normal state conductance of graphene is finite, but also a finite supercurrent can flow at zero charge density.

However, the physical structure of graphene - a single layer of carbon atoms densely packed in a honeycomb crystal lattice - is also puzzling. On the one hand, graphene appears to be a strictly two-dimensional material, exhibiting such a high crystal quality that electrons can travel submicrometre distances without scattering. On the other hand, perfect two-dimensional crystals cannot exist in the free state, according to both theory and experiment(4-9). This incompatibility can be avoided by arguing that all the graphene structures studied so far were an integral part of larger three-dimensional structures, either supported by a bulk substrate or embedded in a three-dimensional matrix(1-3,9-12). Here we report on individual graphene sheets freely suspended on a microfabricated scaffold in vacuum or air. These membranes are only one atom thick, yet they still display long-range crystalline order. However, our studies by transmission electron microscopy also reveal that these suspended graphene sheets are not perfectly flat: they exhibit intrinsic microscopic roughening such that the surface normal varies by several degrees and out-of-plane deformations reach 1 nm. The atomically thin single-crystal membranes offer ample scope for fundamental research and new technologies, whereas the observed corrugations in the third dimension may provide subtle reasons for the stability of two-dimensional crystals(13-15).","Max Planck Inst Solid State Res, D-70569 Stuttgart, Germany; Univ Manchester, Manchester Ctr Mesosci & Nanotechnol, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England; Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Inst Mol & Mat, NL-6525 ED Nijmegen, Netherlands","Meyer, JC (reprint author), Max Planck Inst Solid State Res, Heisenbergstr 1, D-70569 Stuttgart, Germany.",email@jannikmeyer.de; geim@man.ac.uk,"Booth, Timothy/A-5847-2012; Meyer, Jannik/H-8541-2012; Geim, Andre/J-7888-2012; Novoselov, Kostya/G-9581-2014; Katsnelson, Mikhail/D-4359-2012","Booth, Timothy/0000-0002-9784-989X; Meyer, Jannik/0000-0003-4023-0778; Geim, Andre/0000-0003-2861-8331; Novoselov, Kostya/0000-0003-4972-5371; ",,,,29,2753,2863,138,1941,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,1-Mar,2007,446,7131,,,,,60,63,,10.1038/nature05545,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,140RY,WOS:000244525600036,17330039,No,Y,N,11/20/17

At cryogenic temperatures, scanning probe microscopy can even provide electron tunnelling spectra that serve as fingerprints of the vibrational properties of adsorbed molecules(3-5) and of the electronic properties of magnetic impurity atoms(6,7), thereby allowing chemical identification. But in many instances, and particularly for insulating systems, determining the exact chemical composition of surfaces or nanostructures remains a considerable challenge. In principle, dynamic force microscopy should make it possible to overcome this problem: it can image insulator, semiconductor and metal surfaces with true atomic resolution(8-10), by detecting and precisely measuring(11-13) the short-range forces that arise with the onset of chemical bonding between the tip and surface atoms(14,15) and that depend sensitively on the chemical identity of the atoms involved. Here we report precise measurements of such short-range chemical forces, and show that their dependence on the force microscope tip used can be overcome through a normalization procedure. This allows us to use the chemical force measurements as the basis for atomic recognition, even at room temperature. We illustrate the performance of this approach by imaging the surface of a particularly challenging alloy system and successfully identifying the three constituent atomic species silicon, tin and lead, even though these exhibit very similar chemical properties and identical surface position preferences that render any discrimination attempt based on topographic measurements impossible.","Osaka Univ, Grad Sch Engn, Suita, Osaka 5650871, Japan; Univ Autonoma Madrid, Dept Fis Teor Mat Condensada, E-28049 Madrid, Spain; Japan Sci & Technol Agcy, PRESTO, Saitama 3320012, Japan; Acad Sci Czech Republ, Inst Phys, Prague 186253, Czech Republic","Custance, O (reprint author), Osaka Univ, Grad Sch Engn, 2-1 Yamadaoka, Suita, Osaka 5650871, Japan.",oscar@afm.eei.eng.osaka-u.ac.jp,"Jelinek, Pavel/G-1542-2010; Perez, Ruben/F-1849-2010; Pou, Pablo/C-3888-2012; Sugimoto, Yoshiaki/K-1691-2013","Jelinek, Pavel/0000-0002-5645-8542; Perez, Ruben/0000-0001-5896-541X; Pou, Pablo/0000-0002-5854-8218; Custance, Oscar/0000-0001-7931-603X; ",,,,26,361,365,10,198,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,1-Mar,2007,446,7131,,,,,64,67,,10.1038/nature05530,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,140RY,WOS:000244525600037,17330040,No,Y,N,11/20/17

Slow stirring of the deep mantle is achieved in the solid state through high-temperature creep of rocks, which are dominated by the mineral MgSiO3 perovskite. Transformation of MgSiO3 to a 'post-perovskite' phase(1-3) may explain the peculiarities of the lowermost mantle, such as the observed seismic anisotropy(4), but the mechanical properties of these mineralogical phases are largely unknown(5-7). Plastic flow of solids involves the motion of a large number of crystal defects, named dislocations(8). A quantitative description of flow in the Earth's mantle requires information about dislocations in high-pressure minerals and their behaviour under stress. This property is currently out of reach of direct atomistic simulations using either empirical interatomic potentials or ab initio calculations. Here we report an alternative to direct atomistic simulations based on the framework of the Peierls - Nabarro model(9,10). Dislocation core models are proposed for MgSiO3 perovskite ( at 100 GPa) and post-perovskite ( at 120 GPa). We show that in perovskite, plastic deformation is strongly influenced by the orthorhombic distortions of the unit cell. In silicate post-perovskite, large dislocations are relaxed through core dissociation, with implications for the mechanical properties and seismic anisotropy of the lowermost mantle.","Univ Lille 1, CNRS, UMR 8008, Lab Struct & Proprietes Etat Solide, F-59655 Villeneuve Dascq, France","Carrez, P (reprint author), Univ Lille 1, CNRS, UMR 8008, Lab Struct & Proprietes Etat Solide, F-59655 Villeneuve Dascq, France.",Patrick.Cordier@univ-lille1.fr,"Cordier, Patrick/D-2357-2012","Cordier, Patrick/0000-0002-1883-2994; Carrez, Philippe/0000-0003-1295-9377",,,,32,52,54,2,34,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,1-Mar,2007,446,7131,,,,,68,70,,10.1038/nature05593,,3,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,140RY,WOS:000244525600038,17330041,No,,,11/20/17

Here we use electrophysiology and in vivo imaging in larval zebrafish ( Danio rerio) to reveal a systematic relationship between the location of a spinal neuron and the minimal swimming frequency at which the neuron is active. Ventral motor neurons and excitatory interneurons are rhythmically active at the lowest swimming frequencies, with increasingly more dorsal excitatory neurons engaged as swimming frequency rises. Inhibitory interneurons follow the opposite pattern. These inverted patterns of recruitment are independent of cell soma size among interneurons, but may be partly explained by concomitant dorso-ventral gradients in input resistance. Laser ablations of ventral, but not dorsal, excitatory interneurons perturb slow movements, supporting a behavioural role for the topography. Our results reveal an unexpected pattern of organization within zebrafish spinal cord that underlies the production of movements of varying speeds.","Cornell Univ, Dept Neurobiol & Behav, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; Univ Chicago, Dept Organismal Biol & Anat, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; Okazaki Inst Integrat Biosci, Natl Inst Nat Sci, Aichi 4448787, Japan; Natl Inst Physiol Sci, Aichi 4448787, Japan","Fetcho, JR (reprint author), Cornell Univ, Dept Neurobiol & Behav, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",jrf49@cornell.edu,,"Higashijima, Shin-ichi/0000-0001-6350-4992","NINDS NIH HHS [R01 NS026539, R01 NS026539-25]",,,30,174,175,3,18,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,1-Mar,2007,446,7131,,,,,71,75,,10.1038/nature05588,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,140RY,WOS:000244525600039,17330042,No,,,11/20/17

Here we show that, in contrast with this well-established paradigm, three mutations in gating-charge-carrying arginine residues in an S4 segment that cause hypokalaemic periodic paralysis(2) induce a hyperpolarization- activated cationic leak through the voltage sensor of the skeletal muscle Na(V)1.4 channel. This 'gating pore current' is active at the resting membrane potential and closed by depolarizations that activate the voltage sensor. It has similar permeability to Na+, K+ and Cs+, but the organic monovalent cations tetraethylammonium and N-methyl-D-glucamine are much less permeant. The inorganic divalent cations Ba2+, Ca2+ and Zn2+ are not detectably permeant and block the gating pore at millimolar concentrations. Our results reveal gating pore current in naturally occurring disease mutations of an ion channel and show a clear correlation between mutations that cause gating pore current and hypokalaemic periodic paralysis. This gain-of-function gating pore current would contribute in an important way to the dominantly inherited membrane depolarization, action potential failure, flaccid paralysis and cytopathology that are characteristic of hypokalaemic periodic paralysis. A survey of other ion channelopathies reveals numerous examples of mutations that would be expected to cause gating pore current, raising the possibility of a broader impact of gating pore current in ion channelopathies.","Univ Washington, Dept Pharmacol, Seattle, WA 98195 USA","Catterall, WA (reprint author), Univ Washington, Dept Pharmacol, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.",wcatt@u.washington.edu,,,,,,24,144,146,0,12,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,1-Mar,2007,446,7131,,,,,76,78,,10.1038/nature05598,,3,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,140RY,WOS:000244525600040,17330043,No,,,11/20/17

As such, a thorough understanding of GSK-3 beta function will have a broad impact on human biology and therapeutics. Because GSK-3 beta interacts with many different pathways, its specific developmental roles remain unclear(5). We have discovered a genetic requirement for GSK-3 beta in midline development. Homozygous null mice display cleft palate, incomplete fusion of the ribs at the midline and bifid sternum as well as delayed sternal ossification. Using a chemically regulated allele of GSK-3 beta ( ref. 6), we have defined requirements for GSK-3 beta activity during discrete temporal windows in palatogenesis and skeletogenesis. The rapamycin-dependent allele of GSK-3 beta produces GSK-3 beta fused to a tag, FRB* (FKBP/rapamycin binding), resulting in a rapidly destabilized chimaeric protein. In the absence of drug, GSK-3 beta(FRB*/FRB*) mutants appear phenotypically identical to GSK-3 beta(-/-) mutants. In the presence of drug, GSK-3 beta FRB* is rapidly stabilized, restoring protein levels and activity(6). Using this system, mutant phenotypes were rescued by restoring endogenous GSK-3 beta activity during two distinct periods in gestation. This technology provides a powerful tool for defining windows of protein function during development.","Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Dept Surg, Div Plast & Reconstruct Surg, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Dept Pathol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Stanford Inst Stem Cell Biol & Regenerat Med, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Dept Dev Biol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Stanford, CA 94305 USA","Liu, KJ (reprint author), Kings Coll London, Dept Craniofacial Dev, London SE1 9RT, England.",karen.liu@kcl.ac.uk; longaker@stanford.edu,"Liu, Karen/F-2870-2010","Liu, Karen/0000-0002-2483-2165",,,,20,86,87,0,10,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,1-Mar,2007,446,7131,,,,,79,82,,10.1038/nature05557,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,140RY,WOS:000244525600041,17293880,No,,,11/20/17

Three to four antigen-specific B cells colonize a follicle to establish a germinal centre and become rapidly dividing germinal-centre centroblasts that give rise to dark zones(1-4). Centroblasts produce non-proliferating centrocytes that are thought to migrate to the light zone of the germinal centre, which is rich in antigen-trapping follicular dendritic cells and CD4(+) T cells(5-7). It has been proposed that centrocytes are selected in the light zone on the basis of their ability to bind cognate antigen(5-8). However, there have been no studies of germinal-centre dynamics or the migratory behaviour of germinal-centre cells in vivo. Here we report the direct visualization of B cells in lymph node germinal centres by two-photon laser-scanning microscopy in mice. Nearly all antigen-specific B cells participating in a germinal-centre reaction were motile and physically restricted to the germinal centre but migrated bidirectionally between dark and light zones. Notably, follicular B cells were frequent visitors to the germinal-centre compartment, suggesting that all B cells scan antigen trapped in germinal centres. Consistent with this observation, we found that high-affinity antigen-specific B cells can be recruited to an ongoing germinal-centre reaction. We conclude that the open structure of germinal centres enhances competition and ensures that rare high-affinity B cells can participate in antibody responses.","NYU, Sch Med, Program Mol Pathogenesis, New York, NY 10016 USA; NYU, Sch Med, Skirball Inst Biomol Med, Dept Pathol, New York, NY 10016 USA; Rockefeller Univ, Lab Mol Immunol, New York, NY 10021 USA; Rockefeller Univ, Howard Hughes Med Inst, New York, NY 10021 USA; NovImmune SA, CH-1211 Geneva 4, Switzerland","Dustin, ML (reprint author), NYU, Sch Med, Program Mol Pathogenesis, New York, NY 10016 USA.",mikeroscope@nyc.rr.com; nussen@rockefeller.edu,,"Dustin, Michael/0000-0003-4983-6389",,,,30,270,271,0,17,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,1-Mar,2007,446,7131,,,,,83,87,,10.1038/nature05573,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,140RY,WOS:000244525600042,17268470,No,,,11/20/17

This arrangement, however, has been in continuous genetic flux: the varying degrees of gene loss and transfer from the mitochondrial genome in different eukaryotic lineages seem to signify an ongoing 'conflict' between the host and the symbiont. Eukaryotic parasites belonging to the phylum Apicomplexa provide an excellent example to support this view. These organisms contain the smallest mitochondrial genomes known(4,5), with an organization that differs among various genera; one genus, Cryptosporidium, seems to have lost the entire mitochondrial genome(6,7). Here we show that erythrocytic stages of the human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum seem to maintain an active mitochondrial electron transport chain to serve just one metabolic function: regeneration of ubiquinone required as the electron acceptor for dihydroorotate dehydrogenase, an essential enzyme for pyrimidine biosynthesis. Transgenic P. falciparum parasites expressing Saccharomyces cerevisiae dihydroorotate dehydrogenase, which does not require ubiquinone as an electron acceptor(8), were completely resistant to inhibitors of mitochondrial electron transport. Maintenance of mitochondrial membrane potential, however, was essential in these parasites, as indicated by their hypersensitivity to proguanil, a drug that collapsed the membrane potential in the presence of electron transport inhibitors. Thus, acquisition of just one enzyme can render mitochondrial electron transport nonessential in erythrocytic stages of P. falciparum.","Drexel Univ, Coll Med, Dept Microbiol & Immunol, Ctr Mol Parasitol, Philadelphia, PA 19129 USA","Vaidya, AB (reprint author), Drexel Univ, Coll Med, Dept Microbiol & Immunol, Ctr Mol Parasitol, Philadelphia, PA 19129 USA.",avaidya@drexelmed.edu,,,NIAID NIH HHS [R01 AI028398],,,30,237,242,1,21,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,1-Mar,2007,446,7131,,,,,88,91,,10.1038/nature05572,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,140RY,WOS:000244525600043,17330044,No,,,11/20/17

The remarkable stability of polyhedra means that, like bacterial spores, these insect viruses remain infectious for years in soil. The environmental persistence of polyhedra is the cause of significant losses in silkworm cocoon harvests but has also been exploited against pests in biological alternatives to chemical insecticides(3,4). Although polyhedra have been extensively characterized since the early 1900s(5), their atomic organization remains elusive(6). Here we describe the 2 angstrom crystal structure of both recombinant and infectious silkworm cypovirus polyhedra determined using crystals 5 - 12 micrometres in diameter purified from insect cells. These are the smallest crystals yet used for de novo X-ray protein structure determination(7). We found that polyhedra are made of trimers of the viral polyhedrin protein and contain nucleotides. Although the shape of these building blocks is reminiscent of some capsid trimers, polyhedrin has a new fold and has evolved to assemble in vivo into three-dimensional cubic crystals rather than icosahedral shells. The polyhedrin trimers are extensively cross-linked in polyhedra by non-covalent interactions and pack with an exquisite molecular complementarity similar to that of antigen - antibody complexes. The resulting ultrastable and sealed crystals shield the virus particles from environmental damage. The structure suggests that polyhedra can serve as the basis for the development of robust and versatile nanoparticles for biotechnological applications 8 such as microarrays(9) and biopesticides(4).","Univ Auckland, Sch Biol Sci, Auckland 1010, New Zealand; Prot Crystal Corp, Osaka 5410053, Japan; Paul Scherrer Inst, Swiss Light Source, CH-5232 Villigen, Switzerland; Altana Pharma AG, D-78467 Constance, Germany; Kyoto Inst Technol, Kyoto 6068585, Japan","Metcalf, P (reprint author), Univ Auckland, Sch Biol Sci, Auckland 1010, New Zealand.",peter.metcalf@auckland.ac.nz,"Metcalf, Peter/B-4598-2011","Mori, Hajime/0000-0001-9219-6140; Coulibaly, Fasseli/0000-0003-3380-2117",,,,30,104,114,5,43,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,1-Mar,2007,446,7131,,,,,97,101,,10.1038/nature05628,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,140RY,WOS:000244525600045,17330045,No,,,11/20/17

We tested 392,935 single-nucleotide polymorphisms in a French case - control cohort. Markers with the most significant difference in genotype frequencies between cases of type 2 diabetes and controls were fast-tracked for testing in a second cohort. This identified four loci containing variants that confer type 2 diabetes risk, in addition to confirming the known association with the TCF7L2 gene. These loci include a non-synonymous polymorphism in the zinc transporter SLC30A8, which is expressed exclusively in insulin-producing beta-cells, and two linkage disequilibrium blocks that contain genes potentially involved in beta-cell development or function (IDE - KIF11 - HHEX and EXT2 - ALX4). These associations explain a substantial portion of disease risk and constitute proof of principle for the genome-wide approach to the elucidation of complex genetic traits.","McGill Univ, Dept Human Genet, Fac Med, Montreal, PQ H3H 1P3, Canada; McGill Univ, Dept Med, Fac Med, Montreal, PQ H3H 1P3, Canada; McGill Univ, Dept Pediat, Fac Med, Montreal, PQ H3H 1P3, Canada; McGill Univ, Montreal, PQ H3A 1A4, Canada; Genome Quebec Innovat Ctr, Montreal, PQ H3A 1A4, Canada; Inst Pasteur, CNRS 8090, Inst Biol, F-59019 Lille, France; Univ Hosp, F-86021 Poitiers, France; INSERM, U780, IFR69, F-94807 Villejuif, France; Corbeil Essonnes Hosp, Endocrinol Diabetol Unit, F-91100 Corbeil Essonnes, France; Ontario Inst Canc Res, Toronto, ON M5G 1L7, Canada; Montreal Diabet Res Ctr, Montreal, PQ H2L 4M1, Canada; Univ Montreal, Mol Nutr Unit, Montreal, PQ H3C 3J7, Canada; Univ Montreal, Dept Nutr, Montreal, PQ H3C 3J7, Canada; Univ Montreal, Ctr Hosp, Montreal, PQ H3C 3J7, Canada; Polypeptide Hormone Lab, Montreal, PQ H3A 2B2, Canada; Dept Anat & Cell Biol, Montreal, PQ H3A 2B2, Canada; Univ London Imperial Coll Sci & Technol, Dept Epidemiol & Publ Hlth, London W2 1PG, England; Univ London Imperial Coll Sci & Technol, Sect Genom Med, London W12 0NN, England; Hammersmith Hosp, London W12 0HS, England","Polychronakos, C (reprint author), McGill Univ, Dept Human Genet, Fac Med, Montreal, PQ H3H 1P3, Canada.",Constantin.Polychronakos@McGill.ca,"Posner, Barry/B-6733-2008; Polychronakos, Constantin/B-8151-2008; Meyre, David/D-7315-2011; Balding, David/G-9898-2011; Shen, Lishuang/B-3040-2013; Dina, Christian/D-3535-2015; Heude, Barbara/G-3095-2016; FROGUEL, Philippe/O-6799-2017","Balding, David/0000-0002-1480-6115; Dina, Christian/0000-0002-7722-7348; Heude, Barbara/0000-0002-1565-1629; FROGUEL, Philippe/0000-0003-2972-0784; Hudson, Thomas/0000-0002-1376-4849; Polychronakos, Constantin/0000-0002-7624-6635; A, Pshezhetsky/0000-0002-6612-1062; Sladek, Robert/0000-0002-2730-1204",,,,50,1805,1900,9,164,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,22-Feb,2007,445,7130,,,,,881,885,,10.1038/nature05616,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,138CR,WOS:000244341200041,17293876,No,Y,N,11/20/17

In the blood and central nervous system, for example, organ mass is determined primarily by growth-factor-regulated cell proliferation and apoptosis to achieve a final target size. Here, we report that the size of the mouse pancreas is constrained by an intrinsic programme established early in development, one that is essentially not subject to growth compensation. Specifically, final pancreas size is limited by the size of the progenitor cell pool that is set aside in the developing pancreatic bud. By contrast, the size of the liver is not constrained by reductions in the progenitor cell pool. These findings show that progenitor cell number, independently of regulation by growth factors, can be a key determinant of organ size.","Harvard Univ, Stem Cell Inst, Dept Mol & Cellular Biol, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; Howard Hughes Med Inst, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Gastrointestinal Unit, Boston, MA 02114 USA","Melton, DA (reprint author), Harvard Univ, Stem Cell Inst, Dept Mol & Cellular Biol, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",bstanger@mail.med.upenn.edu; dmelton@harvard.edu,,,,,,42,211,213,1,15,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,22-Feb,2007,445,7130,,,,,886,891,,10.1038/nature05537,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,138CR,WOS:000244341200042,17259975,No,,,11/20/17

Spectroscopic observations of the transiting planets can probe the physical conditions of their atmospheres(1,2). One such technique(3,4) can be used to derive the planetary spectrum by subtracting the stellar spectrum measured during eclipse ( planet hidden behind star) from the combined-light spectrum measured outside eclipse ( star+planet). Although several attempts have been made from Earth-based observatories, no spectrum has yet been measured for any of the established extrasolar planets. Here we report a measurement of the infrared spectrum (7.5 - 13.2 mu m) of the transiting extrasolar planet HD 209458b. Our observations reveal a hot thermal continuum for the planetary spectrum, with an approximately constant ratio to the stellar flux over this wavelength range. Superposed on this continuum is a broad emission peak centred near 9.65 mu m that we attribute to emission by silicate clouds. We also find a narrow, unidentified emission feature at 7.78 mu m. Models of these 'hot Jupiter('5) planets predict a flux peak(6-9) near 10 mu m, where thermal emission from the deep atmosphere emerges relatively unimpeded by water absorption, but models dominated by water fit the observed spectrum poorly.","NASA, Goddard Space Flight Ctr, Exoplanets & Stellar Astrophys Lab, Greenbelt, MD 20771 USA; NASA, Goddard Space Flight Ctr, Planetary Syst Lab, Greenbelt, MD 20771 USA; Florida Inst Technol, Dept Phys & Space Sci, Melbourne, FL 32901 USA; Carnegie Inst Washington, Dept Terr Magnetism, Washington, DC 20015 USA; MIT, Dept Earth Atmospher & Planetary Sci, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; Univ Cent Florida, Dept Phys, Orlando, FL 32816 USA","Richardson, LJ (reprint author), NASA, Goddard Space Flight Ctr, Exoplanets & Stellar Astrophys Lab, Mail Code 667, Greenbelt, MD 20771 USA.",lee.richardson@colorado.edu,"Harrington, Joseph/E-6250-2011","Harrington, Joseph/0000-0002-8955-8531",,,,30,125,126,0,10,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,22-Feb,2007,445,7130,,,,,892,895,,10.1038/nature05636,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,138CR,WOS:000244341200043,17314975,No,,,11/20/17

When an atom is strongly coupled to a cavity mode 1,2, it is possible to realize important quantum information processing tasks, such as controlled coherent coupling and entanglement of distinguishable quantum systems. Realizing these tasks in the solid state is clearly desirable, and coupling semiconductor self-assembled quantum dots to monolithic optical cavities is a promising route to this end. However, validating the efficacy of quantum dots in quantum information applications requires confirmation of the quantum nature of the quantum-dot-cavity system in the strong-coupling regime. Here we find such confirmation by observing quantum correlations in photoluminescence from a photonic crystal nanocavity(3-5) interacting with one, and only one, quantum dot located precisely at the cavity electric field maximum. When off-resonance, photon emission from the cavity mode and quantum-dot excitons is anticorrelated at the level of single quanta, proving that the mode is driven solely by the quantum dot despite an energy mismatch between cavity and excitons. When tuned to resonance, the exciton and cavity enter the strong-coupling regime of cavity QED and the quantum-dot exciton lifetime reduces by a factor of 145. The generated photon stream becomes antibunched, proving that the strongly coupled exciton/photon system is in the quantum regime.

The biosynthesis of these natural products appears to be initiated by an electrophilic halogenation reaction at a carbon - carbon double bond(2-4) via a mechanism that is similar to a proton-induced olefin polycyclization(5-8). Enzymes such as haloperoxidases generate an electrophilic halonium ion ( or its equivalent), which reacts with the terminal carbon - carbon double bond of the polyprenoid, enantioselectively inducing a cyclization reaction that produces a halogenated polycyclic terpenoid. Use of an enantioselective halocyclization reaction is one possible way to chemically synthesize these halogenated cyclic terpenoids; although several brominated cyclic terpenoids have been synthesized via a diastereoselective halocyclization reaction that uses stoichiometric quantities of a brominating reagent(9-12), the enantioselective halocyclization of isoprenoids induced by a chiral promoter has not yet been reported. Here we report the enantioselective halocyclization of simple polyprenoids using a nucleophilic promoter. Achiral nucleophilic phosphorus compounds are able to promote the diastereoselective halocyclization reaction to give a halogenated cyclic product in excellent yields. Moreover, chiral phosphoramidites promote the enantioselective halocyclization of simple polyprenoids with N-iodosuccinimide to give iodinated cyclic products in up to 99% enantiomeric excess and diastereomeric excess. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first successful example of the enantioselective halopolycyclization of polyprenoids.","Nagoya Univ, Grad Sch Engn, Chikusa Ku, Nagoya, Aichi 4648603, Japan","Ishihara, K (reprint author), Nagoya Univ, Grad Sch Engn, Chikusa Ku, Nagoya, Aichi 4648603, Japan.",ishihara@cc.nagoya-u.ac.jp,"Sakakura, Akira/A-6319-2013","Sakakura, Akira/0000-0002-2995-1251",,,,18,229,230,3,57,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,22-Feb,2007,445,7130,,,,,900,903,,10.1038/nature05553,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,138CR,WOS:000244341200045,17314976,No,Y,N,11/20/17

Subglacial lake water moves between lakes(1) and rapidly drains, causing catastrophic floods(2). The exact mechanisms by which subglacial lakes influence ice-sheet dynamics are unknown, however, and large subglacial lakes(3,4) have not been closely associated with rapidly flowing ice streams. Here we use satellite imagery and ice-surface elevations to identify a region of subglacial lakes, similar in total area to Lake Vostok, at the onset region of the Recovery Glacier ice stream in East Antarctica and predicted by ice-sheet models(5). We define four lakes through extensive, flat, featureless regions of ice surface bounded by upstream troughs and downstream ridges. Using ice velocities determined using interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR), we find the onset of rapid flow ( moving at 20 to 30 m yr(-1)) of the tributaries to the Recovery Glacier ice stream in a 280-km-wide segment at the downslope margins of these four subglacial lakes. We conclude that the subglacial lakes initiate and maintain rapid ice flow through either active modification of the basal thermal regime of the ice sheet by lake accretion or through scouring bedrock channels in periodic drainage events. We suggest that the role of subglacial lakes needs to be considered in ice-sheet mass balance assessments.","Columbia Univ, Lamont Doherty Earth Observ, Palisades, NY 10964 USA; NASA, Goddard Space Flight Ctr, Greenbelt, MD 20771 USA; Univ New Hampshire, Inst Study Earth Oceans & Space, Durham, NH 03824 USA; Univ Washington, Appl Phys Lab, Seattle, WA 98105 USA","Bell, RE (reprint author), Columbia Univ, Lamont Doherty Earth Observ, Palisades, NY 10964 USA.",robinb@ldeo.columbia.edu,"Joughin, Ian/A-2998-2008; Fahnestock, Mark/N-2678-2013","Joughin, Ian/0000-0001-6229-679X; ",,,,22,132,138,3,44,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,22-Feb,2007,445,7130,,,,,904,907,,10.1038/nature05554,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,138CR,WOS:000244341200046,17314977,No,,,11/20/17

This deep water formation varied strongly between Dansgaard/ Oeschger interstadials and Heinrich events millennial- scale abrupt warm and cold events, respectively, during the last glacial period(3). Increases in the moisture transport across Central America have been proposed to coincide with northerly shifts of the Intertropical Convergence Zone and with Dansgaard/ Oeschger interstadials, with opposite changes for Heinrich events(4). Here we reconstruct sea surface salinities in the eastern equatorial Pacific Ocean over the past 90,000 years by comparing palaeotemperature estimates from alkenones and Mg/Ca ratios with foraminiferal oxygen isotope ratios that vary with both temperature and salinity. We detect millennial- scale fluctuations of sea surface salinities in the eastern equatorial Pacific Ocean of up to two to four practical salinity units. High salinities are associated with the southward migration of the tropical Atlantic Intertropical Convergence Zone, coinciding with Heinrich events and with Greenland stadials(5). The amplitudes of these salinity variations are significantly larger on the Pacific side of the Panama isthmus, as inferred from a comparison of our data with a palaeoclimate record from the Caribbean basin(6).

A key example is the lek paradox, in which female choice is expected rapidly to become ineffective owing to loss of additive genetic variability for the preferred traits(1-3). Here we exploit a remarkable system in which female fur seals exert choice by moving across a crowded breeding colony to visit largely static males. We show that females move further to maximize the balance between male high multilocus heterozygosity and low relatedness. Such a system shows that female choice can be important even in a strongly polygynous species, and at the same time may help to resolve the lek paradox because heterozygosity has low heritability and inbreeding avoidance means there is no single 'best' male for all females.","Univ Cambridge, Dept Zool, Cambridge CB2 3EJ, England; British Antarctic Survey, NERC, Cambridge CB3 0ET, England","Hoffman, JI (reprint author), Univ Cambridge, Dept Zool, Downing St, Cambridge CB2 3EJ, England.",jih24@cam.ac.uk,"hoffman, joseph/K-7725-2012","hoffman, joseph/0000-0001-5895-8949",,,,30,118,120,5,52,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,22-Feb,2007,445,7130,,,,,912,914,,10.1038/nature05558,,3,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,138CR,WOS:000244341200048,17287726,No,,,11/20/17

Here we show, using sequences from a large data set of bacterial strains that, as in humans, genetic diversity in H. pylori decreases with geographic distance from east Africa, the cradle of modern humans. We also observe similar clines of genetic isolation by distance (IBD) for both H. pylori and its human host at a worldwide scale. Like humans, simulations indicate that H. pylori seems to have spread from east Africa around 58,000 yr ago. Even at more restricted geographic scales, where IBD tends to become blurred, principal component clines in H. pylori from Europe strongly resemble the classical clines for Europeans described by Cavalli-Sforza and colleagues(7). Taken together, our results establish that anatomically modern humans were already infected by H. pylori before their migrations from Africa and demonstrate that H. pylori has remained intimately associated with their human host populations ever since.","Max Planck Inst Infekt Biol, Dept Mol Biol, D-10117 Berlin, Germany; Univ Cambridge, Dept Genet, Theoret & Mol Populat Genet Grp, Cambridge CB2 3EH, England; Univ Cambridge, Dept Zool, Evolut Ecol Grp, Cambridge CB2 3EJ, England; Univ Oxford, Dept Stat, Oxford OX1 3SY, England; Ctr IRD Montpellier, CNRS, UMR 2724, IRD, F-34394 Montpellier 05, France; Univ Pretoria, Dept Internal Med & Gastroenterol, ZA-0002 Pretoria, South Africa; Baylor Coll Med, Dept Med Gastroenterol, Houston, TX 77030 USA; Michael E DeBakey VA Med Ctr, Houston, TX 77030 USA; Donostia Hosp, Dept Microbiol, San Sebastian, Spain; Lund Univ, Dept Lab Med, SE-22632 Lund, Sweden; Hannover Med Sch, Inst Med Mikrobiol & Krankenhaushyg, D-30625 Hannover, Germany","Achtman, M (reprint author), Max Planck Inst Infekt Biol, Dept Mol Biol, D-10117 Berlin, Germany.",fb255@mole.bio.cam.ac.uk; Suerbaum.Sebastian@mh-hannover.de; achtman@mpiib-berlin.mpg.de,"Balloux, Francois/D-4783-2009; Manica, Andrea/B-5497-2008","Manica, Andrea/0000-0003-1895-450X; Balloux, Francois/0000-0003-1978-7715; Achtman, Mark/0000-0001-6815-0070",Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council [BB/C007123/1]; Wellcome Trust [069662],,,24,460,481,5,55,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,22-Feb,2007,445,7130,,,,,915,918,,10.1038/nature05562,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,138CR,WOS:000244341200049,17287725,No,,,11/20/17

We are not born with it; children develop a sense of the future at around the age of two and some planning ability by only the age of four to five(1-3). According to the Bischof-Kohler hypothesis(4), only humans can dissociate themselves from their current motivation and take action for future needs: other animals are incapable of anticipating future needs, and any future-oriented behaviours they exhibit are either fixed action patterns or cued by their current motivational state. The experiments described here test whether a member of the corvid family, the western scrub-jay (Aphelocoma californica), plans for the future. We show that the jays make provision for a future need, both by preferentially caching food in a place in which they have learned that they will be hungry the following morning and by differentially storing a particular food in a place in which that type of food will not be available the next morning. Previous studies have shown that, in accord with the Bischof-Kohler hypothesis, rats(5) and pigeons(6) may solve tasks by encoding the future but only over very short time scales. Although some primates and corvids(7-9) take actions now that are based on their future consequences, these have not been shown to be selected with reference to future motivational states(10), or without extensive reinforcement of the anticipatory act(11). The results described here suggest that the jays can spontaneously plan for tomorrow without reference to their current motivational state, thereby challenging the idea that this is a uniquely human ability.","Univ Cambridge, Dept Expt Psychol, Cambridge CB2 3EB, England","Clayton, NS (reprint author), Univ Cambridge, Dept Expt Psychol, Downing St, Cambridge CB2 3EB, England.",nsc22@cam.ac.uk,"Clayton, Nicola/A-2891-2010",,Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council [BB/D000335/1],,,20,275,286,7,176,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,22-Feb,2007,445,7130,,,,,919,921,,10.1038/nature05575,,3,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,138CR,WOS:000244341200050,17314979,No,Y,N,11/20/17

Ageing in many organisms, including humans, is accompanied by marked alterations in both general and specific protein synthesis(1). Whether these alterations are simply a corollary of the ageing process or have a causative role in senescent decline remains unclear. An array of protein factors facilitates the tight control of messenger RNA translation initiation(2). The eukaryotic initiation factor 4E (eIF4E), which binds the 7-monomethyl guanosine cap at the 5' end of all nuclear mRNAs, is a principal regulator of protein synthesis(3). Here we show that loss of a specific eIF4E isoform (IFE-2) that functions in somatic tissues(4) reduces global protein synthesis, protects from oxidative stress and extends lifespan in Caenorhabditis elegans. Lifespan extension is independent of the forkhead transcription factor DAF-16, which mediates the effects of the insulin-like signalling pathway on ageing. Furthermore, IFE-2 deficiency further extends the lifespan of long-lived age and daf nematode mutants. Similarly, lack of IFE-2 enhances the long-lived phenotype of clk and dietary-restricted eat mutant animals. Knockdown of target of rapamycin ( TOR), a phosphatidylinositol kinase-related kinase that controls protein synthesis in response to nutrient cues, further increases the longevity of ife-2 mutants. Thus, signalling via eIF4E in the soma is a newly discovered pathway influencing ageing in C. elegans.","Fdn Res & Technol Hellas, Inst Mol Biol & Biotechnol, Iraklion 71110, Crete, Greece","Tavernarakis, N (reprint author), Fdn Res & Technol Hellas, Inst Mol Biol & Biotechnol, Iraklion 71110, Crete, Greece.",tavernarakis@imbb.forth.gr,"Tavernarakis, Nektarios/B-9684-2013","Tavernarakis, Nektarios/0000-0002-5253-1466; Syntichaki, Popi/0000-0001-9536-8905",,,,32,179,200,0,13,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,22-Feb,2007,445,7130,,,,,922,926,,10.1038/nature05603,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,138CR,WOS:000244341200051,17277769,No,,,11/20/17

T-reg cells have an attenuated cytokine response to T-cell receptor stimulation, and can suppress the proliferation and effector function of neighbouring T cells(3,4). The forkhead transcription factor Foxp3 ( forkhead box P3) is selectively expressed in T-reg cells, is required for T-reg development and function, and is sufficient to induce a Treg phenotype in conventional CD4(+) CD25(-) T cells(5-8). Mutations in Foxp3 cause severe, multi-organ autoimmunity in both human and mouse(9-11). FOXP3 can cooperate in a DNA-binding complex with NFAT ( nuclear factor of activated T cells) to regulate the transcription of several known target genes(12). However, the global set of genes regulated directly by Foxp3 is not known and consequently, how this transcription factor controls the gene expression programme for T-reg function is not understood. Here we identify Foxp3 target genes and report that many of these are key modulators of T-cell activation and function. Remarkably, the predominant, although not exclusive, effect of Foxp3 occupancy is to suppress the activation of target genes on T-cell stimulation. Foxp3 suppression of its targets appears to be crucial for the normal function of T-reg cells, because overactive variants of some target genes are known to be associated with autoimmune disease.","Whitehead Inst Biomed Res, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; MIT, Dept Biol, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; MIT, Dept Elect Engn & Comp Sci, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; MIT, Biol Engn Div, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; MIT, Comp Sci & Artificial Intelligence Lab, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; Dana Farber Canc Inst, Dept Canc Immunol & AIDS, Boston, MA 02115 USA; Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Pathol, Boston, MA 02115 USA","Young, RA (reprint author), Whitehead Inst Biomed Res, 9 Cambridge Ctr, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA.",Harald_von_Boehmer@dfci.harvard.edu; young@wi.mit.edu,"Kretschmer, Karsten/E-8174-2010; Young, Richard/F-6495-2012; Polansky-Biskup, Julia/J-5937-2017","Kretschmer, Karsten/0000-0001-6770-4078; Frampton, Garrett/0000-0002-2361-2750; Fraenkel, Ernest/0000-0001-9249-8181; Young, Richard/0000-0001-8855-8647; Polansky-Biskup, Julia/0000-0003-4727-2540","NCI NIH HHS [P01 CA109901-067138, P01 CA109901]; NHGRI NIH HHS [R01 HG002668, R01 HG002668-04A1]",,,30,426,462,3,26,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,22-Feb,2007,445,7130,,,,,931,935,,10.1038/nature05478,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,138CR,WOS:000244341200053,17237765,No,Y,N,11/20/17

In humans and mice, Foxp3 deficiency results in a paucity of T-R cells and a fatal breach in immunological tolerance, causing highly aggressive multi-organ autoimmune pathology(1-3). Here, through genome-wide analysis combining chromatin immunoprecipitation with mouse genome tiling array profiling, we identify Foxp3 binding regions for 700 genes and for an intergenically encoded microRNA. We find that a large number of Foxp3-bound genes are up-or downregulated in Foxp3(+) T cells, suggesting that Foxp3 acts as both a transcriptional activator and repressor. Foxp3-mediated regulation unique to the thymus affects, among others, genes encoding nuclear factors that control gene expression and chromatin remodelling. In contrast, Foxp3 target genes shared by the thymic and peripheral T-R cells encode primarily plasma membrane proteins, as well as cell signalling proteins.

Coat assembly is initiated when Sar1-GTP recruits the cargo adaptor complex, Sec23/Sec24, by binding to its GTPase-activating protein ( GAP) Sec23 (ref. 2). This leads to the capture of transmembrane cargo by Sec24 (refs 3, 4) before the coat is polymerized by the Sec13/Sec31 complex(5). The initial interaction of a vesicle with its target membrane is mediated by tethers(6). We report here that in yeast and mammalian cells the tethering complex TRAPPI ( ref. 7) binds to the coat subunit Sec23. This event requires the Bet3 subunit. In vitro studies demonstrate that the interaction between Sec23 and Bet3 targets TRAPPI to COPII vesicles to mediate vesicle tethering. We propose that the binding of TRAPPI to Sec23 marks a coated vesicle for fusion with another COPII vesicle or the Golgi apparatus.

These operate by computing, for each familiar individual, a unitary regulatory variable ( the kinship index) that corresponds to a pairwise estimate of genetic relatedness between self and other. The cues that the system uses were identified by quantitatively matching individual exposure to potential cues of relatedness to variation in three outputs relevant to the system's evolved functions: sibling altruism, aversion to personally engaging in sibling incest, and moral opposition to third party sibling incest. As predicted, the kin detection system uses two distinct, ancestrally valid cues to compute relatedness: the familiar other's perinatal association with the individual's biological mother, and duration of sibling coresidence.","Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Ctr Evolut Psychol, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; Univ Hawaii, Dept Psychol, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA","Lieberman, D (reprint author), Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Ctr Evolut Psychol, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA.",debra@debralieberman.com,,,"NIH HHS [DP1 OD000516, DP1 OD000516-02]",,,43,230,238,2,58,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,15-Feb,2007,445,7129,,,,,727,731,,10.1038/nature05510,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,136EK,WOS:000244205200036,17301784,No,Y,N,11/20/17

To evaluate how these determinants might provide opportunities for antibody recognition, we created variants of gp120 stabilized in the CD4-bound state, assessed binding of CD4 and of receptor-binding-site antibodies, and determined the structure at 2.3 angstrom resolution of the broadly neutralizing antibody b12 in complex with gp120. b12 binds to a conformationally invariant surface that overlaps a distinct subset of the CD4-binding site.

None of the models proposed to unravel their origin(7-10) can simultaneously explain their exceptional dark matter content and their proximity to a much larger galaxy. Here we report simulations showing that the progenitors of these galaxies were probably gas-dominated dwarf galaxies that became satellites of a larger galaxy earlier than the other dwarf spheroidals. We find that a combination of tidal shocks and ram pressure swept away the entire gas content of such progenitors about ten billion years ago because heating by the cosmic ultraviolet background kept the gas loosely bound: a tiny stellar component embedded in a relatively massive dark halo survived until today.

Plasma-based accelerators are particularly attractive because they are capable of producing accelerating fields that are orders of magnitude larger than those used in conventional colliders(1-3). In these accelerators, a drive beam ( either laser or particle) produces a plasma wave (wakefield) that accelerates charged particles(4-11). The ultimate utility of plasma accelerators will depend on sustaining ultrahigh accelerating fields over a substantial length to achieve a significant energy gain. Here we show that an energy gain of more than 42 GeV is achieved in a plasma wakefield accelerator of 85 cm length, driven by a 42 GeV electron beam at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC). The results are in excellent agreement with the predictions of three-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations. Most of the beam electrons lose energy to the plasma wave, but some electrons in the back of the same beam pulse are accelerated with a field of similar to 52 GV m(-1). This effectively doubles their energy, producing the energy gain of the 3-km-long SLAC accelerator in less than a metre for a small fraction of the electrons in the injected bunch.

The main problem with existing approaches is the large power consumption of conventional organic circuits, which makes battery-powered applications problematic, if not impossible. Here we demonstrate an organic circuit with very low power consumption that uses a self-assembled monolayer gate dielectric and two different air-stable molecular semiconductors (pentacene and hexadecafluorocopperphthalocyanine, F16CuPc). The monolayer dielectric is grown on patterned metal gates at room temperature and is optimized to provide a large gate capacitance and low gate leakage currents. By combining low-voltage p-channel and n-channel organic thin-film transistors in a complementary circuit design, the static currents are reduced to below 100 pA per logic gate. We have fabricated complementary inverters, NAND gates, and ring oscillators that operate with supply voltages between 1.5 and 3 V and have a static power consumption of less than 1 nW per logic gate.

Nanofabricated membranes have great potential in molecular separation applications by offering more precise structural control(3,4), yet transport is also limited by micrometre-scale thicknesses(5). This limitation can be addressed by a new class of ultrathin nanostructured membranes where the membrane is roughly as thick (similar to 10 nm) as the molecules being separated, but membrane fragility and complex fabrication have prevented the use of ultrathin membranes for molecular separations(1). Here we report the development of an ultrathin porous nanocrystalline silicon (pnc-Si) membrane using straightforward silicon fabrication techniques that provide control over average pore sizes from approximately 5 nm to 25 nm. Our pnc-Si membranes can retain proteins while permitting the transport of small molecules at rates an order of magnitude faster than existing materials, separate differently sized proteins under physiological conditions, and separate similarly sized molecules carrying different charges. Despite being only 15 nm thick, pnc-Si membranes that are free-standing over 40,000 mu m(2) can support a full atmosphere of differential pressure without plastic deformation or fracture.

This background level of excitation has been called the 'hum' of the Earth(2), and is equivalent to the maximum excitation froma magnitude 5.75 earthquake(3). Its origin is debated, with most studies attributing the forcing to atmospheric turbulence, analogous to the forcing of solar oscillations by solar turbulence(2,4-7). Some reports also predicted that turbulence might excite the planetary modes of Mars to detectable levels(4). Recent observations on Earth, however, suggest that the predominant excitation source lies under the oceans(8-10). Here I show that turbulence is a very weak source, and instead it is interacting ocean waves over the shallow continental shelves that drive the hum of the Earth. Ocean waves couple into seismic waves through the quadratic nonlinearity of the surface boundary condition, which couples pairs of slowly propagating ocean waves of similar frequency to a high phase velocity component at approximately double the frequency. This is the process by which ocean waves generate the well known 'microseism peak' that dominates the seismic spectrum near 140 mHz (refs 11, 12), but at hum frequencies, the mechanism differs significantly in frequency and depth dependence. A calculation of the coupling between ocean waves and seismic modes reproduces the seismic spectrum observed. Measurements of the temporal correlation between ocean wave data and seismic data(9,10) have confirmed that ocean waves, rather than atmospheric turbulence, are driving the modes of the Earth.","Columbia Univ, Lamont Doherty Earth Observ, Palisades, NY 10964 USA","Webb, SC (reprint author), Columbia Univ, Lamont Doherty Earth Observ, Palisades, NY 10964 USA.",scw@ldeo.columbia.edu,,,,,,26,89,89,0,10,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,15-Feb,2007,445,7129,,,,,754,756,,10.1038/nature05536,,3,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,136EK,WOS:000244205200042,17301790,No,,,11/20/17

Much attention has been focused on biodiversity hotspots(1). However, the conservation of evolutionary process is now also acknowledged as a priority in the face of global change(2). Phylogenetic diversity (PD) is a biodiversity index that measures the length of evolutionary pathways that connect a given set of taxa(3,4). PD therefore identifies sets of taxa that maximize the accumulation of 'feature diversity'. Recent studies, however, concluded that taxon richness is a good surrogate for PD(5-9). Here we show taxon richness to be decoupled from PD, using a biome-wide phylogenetic analysis of the flora of an undisputed biodiversity hotspot - the Cape of South Africa. We demonstrate that this decoupling has real-world importance for conservation planning. Finally, using a database of medicinal and economic plant use(10), we demonstrate that PD protection is the best strategy for preserving feature diversity in the Cape. We should be able to use PD to identify those key regions that maximize future options, both for the continuing evolution of life on Earth and for the benefit of society.","Kirstenbosch Res Ctr, S African Natl Biodivers Inst, ZA-7735 Claremont, South Africa; Univ Cape Town, Dept Bot, ZA-7700 Rondebosch, South Africa; Royal Bot Gardens, Jodrell Lab, Richmond TW9 3DS, Surrey, England; S African Natl Biodivers Inst, Biodivers Planning Unit, ZA-0001 Pretoria, South Africa; Univ Virginia, Dept Biol, Charlottesville, VA 22904 USA; Univ Georgia, Inst Ecol, Athens, GA 30602 USA; Nelson Mandela Metropolitan Univ, Dept Bot, ZA-6031 Port Elizabeth, South Africa; Australian Museum, Sydney, NSW 2010, Australia; Univ Cambridge, Dept Zool, Cambridge CB2 3EJ, England; Univ Stellenbosch, Ctr Invas Biol, ZA-7602 Matieland, South Africa; Univ Johannesburg, Dept Bot & Plant Biotechnol, ZA-2006 Auckland Pk, South Africa","Forest, F (reprint author), Kirstenbosch Res Ctr, S African Natl Biodivers Inst, Private Bag X7, ZA-7735 Claremont, South Africa.",f.forest@kew.org; v.savolainen@kew.org,"Rouget, Mathieu/B-7249-2008; Proches, Serban/A-2044-2008","Rouget, Mathieu/0000-0003-1836-7727; Savolainen, Vincent/0000-0001-5350-9984",,,,30,383,398,21,257,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,15-Feb,2007,445,7129,,,,,757,760,,10.1038/nature05587,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,136EK,WOS:000244205200043,17301791,No,Y,N,11/20/17

The genetic basis of this difference in phenotype is unknown. Here we show that susceptibility to SCC is under the control of a carboxyterminal polymorphism in the mouse Ptch gene. F-1 hybrids between C57BL/6 and FVB/N strains ((B6FVB)F-1) are resistant to Ras-induced SCCs, but resistance can be overcome either by elimination of the C57BL/6 Ptch allele (Ptch(B6)) or by overexpression of the FVB/N Ptch allele (Ptch(FVB)) in the epidermis of K5Hras-transgenic (B6FVB) F-1 hybrid mice. The human Patched (PTCH) gene is a classical tumour suppressor gene for basal cell carcinomas and medulloblastomas, the loss of which causes increased signalling through the Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) pathway(2-5). SCCs that develop in Ptch(B6+/-) mice do not lose the wild-type Ptch gene or show evidence of increased SHH signalling. Although Ptch(FVB) overexpression can promote SCC formation, continued expression is not required for tumour maintenance, suggesting a role at an early stage of tumour cell lineage commitment. The Ptch polymorphism affects Hras-induced apoptosis, and binding to Tid1, the mouse homologue of the Drosophila l( 2) tid tumour suppressor gene. We propose that Ptch occupies a critical niche in determining basal or squamous cell lineage, and that both tumour types can arise from the same target cell depending on carcinogen exposure and host genetic background.","Univ Calif San Francisco, Canc Res Inst, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; Univ Glasgow, CRC Dept Med Oncol, Glasgow G61 1BD, Lanark, Scotland; Yale Univ, Sch Med, Dept Dermatol, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Biochem & Biophys, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA","Balmain, A (reprint author), Univ Calif San Francisco, Canc Res Inst, 2340 Sutter St, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA.",abalmain@cc.ucsf.edu,,"Mao, Jian-Hua/0000-0001-9320-6021",,,,29,75,75,0,2,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,15-Feb,2007,445,7129,,,,,761,765,,10.1038/nature05489,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,136EK,WOS:000244205200044,17230190,No,,,11/20/17

The development and function of T-R cells is controlled by Foxp3 (refs 1, 2), a lack of which results in loss of T-R cells and massive multi-organ autoimmunity in scurfy mice and IPEX ( immune dysregulation, polyendocrinopathy, enteropathy, X-linked) patients(3,4). It is generally thought that, through a binary mechanism, Foxp3 expression serves as an on-and-off switch to regulate positively the physiology of T-R cells; however, emerging evidence associates decreased Foxp3 expression in T-R cells with various immune disorders(5-7). We hypothesized that Foxp3 regulates T(R)cell development and function in a dose-dependent, nonbinary manner, and that decreased Foxp3 expression can cause immune disease. Here, by generating a mouse model in which endogenous Foxp3 gene expression is attenuated in T-R cells, we show that decreased Foxp3 expression results in the development of an aggressive autoimmune syndrome similar to that of scurfy mice, but does not affect thymic development, homeostatic expansion/maintenance or transforming-growth-factor-beta-induced de novo generation of Foxp3-expressing cells. The immune-suppressive activities of T cells with attenuated Foxp3 expression were nearly abolished in vitro and in vivo, whereas their anergic properties in vitro were maintained. This was accompanied by decreased expression of T(R)cell 'signature genes'. Notably, T cells expressing decreased Foxp3 preferentially became T-helper 2 (T(H)2)-type effectors even in a T(H)1-polarizing environment. These cells instructed T(H)2 differentiation of conventional T cells, which contributed to the immune diseases observed in these mice. Thus, decreased Foxp3 expression causes immune disease by subverting the suppressive function of T-R cells and converting T-R cells into effector cells; these findings are important for understanding the regulation of T-R cell function and the aetiology of various human immune diseases.","Yale Univ, Sch Med, Immunobiol Sect, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; Howard Hughes Med Inst, New Haven, CT 06520 USA","Flavell, RA (reprint author), Yale Univ, Sch Med, Immunobiol Sect, 300 Cedar St, New Haven, CT 06520 USA.",richard.flavell@yale.edu,,,,,,27,503,538,1,18,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,15-Feb,2007,445,7129,,,,,766,770,,10.1038/nature05479,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,136EK,WOS:000244205200045,17220876,No,Y,N,11/20/17

Despite its important role, molecular and functional features conferred by Foxp3 to T-R precursor cells remain unknown. It has been suggested that Foxp3 expression is required for both survival of T-R precursors as well as their inability to produce interleukin (IL)-2 and independently proliferate after T-cell-receptor engagement, raising the possibility that such 'anergy' and T-R suppressive capacity are intimately linked(2-4). Here we show, by dissociating Foxp3-dependent features from those induced by the signals preceding and promoting its expression in mice, that the latter signals include several functional and transcriptional hallmarks of T-R cells. Although its function is required for T-R cell suppressor activity, Foxp3 to a large extent amplifies and fixes pre-established molecular features of T-R cells, including anergy and dependence on paracrine IL-2. Furthermore, Foxp3 solidifies T-R cell lineage stability through modification of cell surface and signalling molecules, resulting in adaptation to the signals required to induce and maintain T-R cells. This adaptation includes Foxp3-dependent repression of cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase 3B, affecting genes responsible for T-R cell homeostasis.","Univ Washington, Dept Immunol, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; Univ Washington, Dept Pharmacol, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; Univ Washington, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; NHLBI, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA","Rudensky, AY (reprint author), Amgen Corp, Seattle, WA 98101 USA.",aruden@u.washington.edu,,"Rasmussen, Jeffrey/0000-0001-6997-3773",,,,23,655,702,2,27,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,15-Feb,2007,445,7129,,,,,771,775,,10.1038/nature05543,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,136EK,WOS:000244205200046,17220874,No,Y,N,11/20/17

VEGF-A is also essential for the induction of endothelial tip cells(2), but it is not known how single tip cells are selected to lead each vessel sprout, and how tip-cell numbers are determined. Here we present evidence that delta-like 4 (Dll4) -Notch1 signalling regulates the formation of appropriate numbers of tip cells to control vessel sprouting and branching in the mouse retina. We show that inhibition of Notch signalling using gamma-secretase inhibitors, genetic inactivation of one allele of the endothelial Notch ligand Dll4, or endothelial-specific genetic deletion of Notch1, all promote increased numbers of tip cells. Conversely, activation of Notch by a soluble jagged1 peptide leads to fewer tip cells and vessel branches. Dll4 and reporters of Notch signalling are distributed in a mosaic pattern among endothelial cells of actively sprouting retinal vessels. At this location, Notch1-deleted endothelial cells preferentially assume tip-cell characteristics. Together, our results suggest that Dll4 - Notch1 signalling between the endothelial cells within the angiogenic sprout serves to restrict tip-cell formation in response to VEGF, thereby establishing the adequate ratio between tip and stalk cells required for correct sprouting and branching patterns. This model offers an explanation for the dose-dependency and haploinsufficiency of the Dll4 gene(3-5), and indicates that modulators of Dll4 or Notch signalling, such as gamma-secretase inhibitors developed for Alzheimer's disease, might find usage as pharmacological regulators of angiogenesis.","Angiogenet Sweden AB, SE-17177 Stockholm, Sweden; Karolinska Inst, Dept Med Biochem & Biophys, Div Matrix Biol, SE-17177 Stockholm, Sweden; Karolinska Inst, Dept Med, SE-17177 Stockholm, Sweden; Canc Res UK, Vasc Biol Lab, London Res Inst, London WC2A 3PX, England; Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Mol Cell & Dev Biol, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; Univ Calif Los Angeles, Inst Mol Biol, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; Hosp Sick Children, Program Dev Biol, Toronto, ON M5G 1X8, Canada; Johns Hopkins Univ, Inst Cell Engn, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA","Hellstrom, M (reprint author), Angiogenet Sweden AB, Scheeles Vag 2, SE-17177 Stockholm, Sweden.",mats.hellstrom@ki.se; holger.gerhardt@cancer.org.uk,"Phng, Li-Kun/L-7346-2013; Gerhardt, Holger/G-4610-2011","Gerhardt, Holger/0000-0002-3030-0384; Hellstrom, Mats/0000-0002-7088-9533",,,,30,798,843,15,110,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,15-Feb,2007,445,7129,,,,,776,780,,10.1038/nature05571,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,136EK,WOS:000244205200047,17259973,No,Y,N,11/20/17

Here we show that Notch signalling is necessary to restrict angiogenic cell behaviour to tip cells in developing segmental arteries in the zebrafish embryo. In the absence of the Notch signalling component Rbpsuh ( recombining binding protein suppressor of hairless) we observed excessive sprouting of segmental arteries, whereas Notch activation suppresses angiogenesis. Through mosaic analysis we find that cells lacking Rbpsuh preferentially localize to the terminal position in developing sprouts. In contrast, cells in which Notch signalling has been activated are excluded from the tip-cell position. In vivo time-lapse analysis reveals that endothelial tip cells undergo a stereotypical pattern of proliferation and migration during sprouting. In the absence of Notch, nearly all sprouting endothelial cells exhibit tip-cell behaviour, leading to excessive numbers of cells within segmental arteries. Furthermore, we find that flt4 (fms-related tyrosine kinase 4, also called vegfr3) is expressed in segmental artery tip cells and becomes ectopically expressed throughout the sprout in the absence of Notch. Loss of flt4 can partially restore normal endothelial cell number in Rbpsuh-deficient segmental arteries. Finally, loss of the Notch ligand dll4 (delta-like 4) also leads to an increased number of endothelial cells within segmental arteries. Together, these studies indicate that proper specification of cell identity, position and behaviour in a developing blood-vessel sprout is required for normal angiogenesis, and implicate the Notch signalling pathway in this process.","Univ Massachusetts, Sch Med, Program Gene Funct & Express, Worcester, MA 01605 USA","Lawson, ND (reprint author), Univ Massachusetts, Sch Med, Program Gene Funct & Express, Lazare Res Bldg,364 Plantat St, Worcester, MA 01605 USA.",nathan.lawson@umassmed.edu,,,,,,24,380,402,3,41,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,15-Feb,2007,445,7129,,,,,781,784,,10.1038/nature05577,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,136EK,WOS:000244205200048,17259972,No,,,11/20/17

Misregulation of these processes leads to pathological conditions such as cancer. Tuberous sclerosis (TSC) is a benign tumour syndrome caused by mutations in either TSC1 or TSC2 tumour suppressor genes. Studies in Drosophila and other organisms have identified TSC signalling as a conserved pathway for growth control. Activation of the TSC pathway is mediated by Rheb (Ras homologue enriched in brain), a Ras superfamily GTPase(1,2). Rheb is a direct target of TSC2 and is negatively regulated by its GTPase-activating protein activity(3-5). However, molecules required for positive regulation of Rheb have not been identified. Here we show that a conserved protein, translationally controlled tumour protein ( TCTP), is an essential new component of the TSC - Rheb pathway. Reducing Drosophila TCTP (dTCTP) levels reduces cell size, cell number and organ size, which mimics Drosophila Rheb (dRheb) mutant phenotypes. dTCTP is genetically epistatic to Tsc1 and dRheb, but acts upstream of dS6k, a downstream target of dRheb. dTCTP directly associates with dRheb and displays guanine nucleotide exchange activity with it in vivo and in vitro. Human TCTP (hTCTP) shows similar biochemical properties compared to dTCTP and can rescue dTCTP mutant phenotypes, suggesting that the function of TCTP in the TSC pathway is evolutionarily conserved. Our studies identify TCTP as a direct regulator of Rheb and a potential therapeutic target for TSC disease.","Texas A&M Univ Syst Hlth Sci Ctr, Program Dev Biol, Houston, TX 77030 USA; Texas A&M Univ Syst Hlth Sci Ctr, Dept Mol & Cellular Biol, Houston, TX 77030 USA; Texas A&M Univ Syst Hlth Sci Ctr, Dept Ophthalmol, Baylor Coll Med, Houston, TX 77030 USA; Texas A&M Univ Syst Hlth Sci Ctr, Inst Biosci & Technol, Houston, TX 77030 USA","Choi, KW (reprint author), Texas A&M Univ Syst Hlth Sci Ctr, Program Dev Biol, Houston, TX 77030 USA.",kchoi@bcm.tmc.edu,"Choi, Kwang-Wook/C-1707-2011",,,,,30,185,197,1,28,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,15-Feb,2007,445,7129,,,,,785,788,,10.1038/nature05528,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,136EK,WOS:000244205200049,17301792,No,,,11/20/17

In addition, Wnt-antagonists (for example, Dkks and sFRP2-like) are expressed anteriorly, whereas Wnt genes themselves are expressed posteriorly, consistent with a role for Wnt signalling in anterior/posterior (A/P) patterning. These results suggest evolutionary conservation of the mechanisms for both D/V and A/P patterning of the early gastrula.

Here we show that for the 670-kilodalton 20S proteasome core particle it is possible to overcome the molecular weight limitations that have traditionally hampered quantitative nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy studies of such large systems. This is achieved by using an isotope labelling scheme where isoleucine, leucine and valine methyls are protonated in an otherwise highly deuterated background in concert with experiments that preserve the lifetimes of the resulting NMR signals. The methodology has been applied to the 20S core particle to reveal functionally important motions and interactions by recording spectra on complexes with molecular weights of up to a megadalton. Our results establish that NMR spectroscopy can provide detailed insight into supra-molecular structures over an order of magnitude larger than those routinely studied using methodology that is generally applicable.","Univ Toronto, Dept Biochem, Toronto, ON M5S 1A8, Canada; Univ Toronto, Dept Med Genet, Toronto, ON M5S 1A8, Canada; Univ Toronto, Dept Chem, Toronto, ON M5S 1A8, Canada","Kay, LE (reprint author), Univ Toronto, Dept Biochem, Toronto, ON M5S 1A8, Canada.",kay@pound.med.utoronto.ca,,,,,,29,290,296,8,58,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,8-Feb,2007,445,7128,,,,,618,622,,10.1038/nature05512,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,133UM,WOS:000244039400037,17237764,No,Y,N,11/20/17

Resonant laser fields interacting with cold, dense atom clouds provide a particularly rich system(2-6). Such light fields interact strongly with the internal electrons of the atoms, and couple directly to external atomic motion through recoil momenta imparted when photons are absorbed and emitted. Ultraslow light propagation in Bose Einstein condensates(7) represents an extreme example of resonant light manipulation using cold atoms. Here we demonstrate that a slow light pulse can be stopped and stored in one Bose - Einstein condensate and subsequently revived from a totally different condensate, 160 mu m away; information is transferred through conversion of the optical pulse into a travelling matter wave. In the presence of an optical coupling field, a probe laser pulse is first injected into one of the condensates where it is spatially compressed to a length much shorter than the coherent extent of the condensate. The coupling field is then turned off, leaving the atoms in the first condensate in quantum superposition states that comprise a stationary component and a recoiling component in a different internal state. The amplitude and phase of the spatially localized light pulse are imprinted on the recoiling part of the wavefunction, which moves towards the second condensate. When this 'messenger' atom pulse is embedded in the second condensate, the system is re-illuminated with the coupling laser. The probe light is driven back on and the messenger pulse is coherently added to the matter field of the second condensate by way of slow-light-mediated atomic matter-wave amplification. The revived light pulse records the relative amplitude and phase between the recoiling atomic imprint and the revival condensate. Our results provide a dramatic demonstration of coherent optical information processing with matter wave dynamics. Such quantum control may find application in quantum information processing and wavefunction sculpting.","Harvard Univ, Dept Phys, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; Harvard Univ, Div Engn & Appl Sci, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA","Hau, LV (reprint author), Harvard Univ, Dept Phys, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",hau@physics.harvard.edu,,,,,,30,75,76,2,36,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,8-Feb,2007,445,7128,,,,,623,626,,10.1038/nature05493,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,133UM,WOS:000244039400038,17287804,No,,,11/20/17

Aunique advantage of the stabilized frequency comb is that it provides, in a single laser beam, about a million optical modes with very narrow linewidths(4) and absolute frequency positions known to better than one part in 10(15) (ref. 5). One important application of this vast array of highly coherent optical fields is precision spectroscopy, in which a large number of modes can be used to map internal atomic energy structure and dynamics(6,7). However, an efficient means of simultaneously identifying, addressing and measuring the amplitude or relative phase of individual modes has not existed. Here we use a high-resolution disperser(8,9) to separate the individual modes of a stabilized frequency comb into a two-dimensional array in the image plane of the spectrometer. We illustrate the power of this technique for high-resolution spectral fingerprinting of molecular iodine vapour, acquiring in a few milliseconds absorption images covering over 6 THz of bandwidth with high frequency resolution. Our technique for direct and parallel accessing of stabilized frequency comb modes could find application in high-bandwidth spread-spectrum communications with increased security, high-resolution coherent quantum control, and arbitrary optical waveform synthesis(10) with control at the optical radian level.","Natl Inst Stand & Technol, Time & Frequency Div, Boulder, CO 80305 USA; CSIR, NML, ZA-0001 Pretoria, South Africa; Univ Witwatersrand, Sch Phys, ZA-2050 Wits, South Africa","Diddams, SA (reprint author), Natl Inst Stand & Technol, Time & Frequency Div, 325 Broadway, Boulder, CO 80305 USA.",sdiddams@boulder.nist.gov,"Diddams, Scott/L-2819-2013","Diddams, Scott/0000-0002-2144-0764",,,,22,344,346,8,113,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,8-Feb,2007,445,7128,,,,,627,630,,10.1038/nature05524,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,133UM,WOS:000244039400039,17287805,No,Y,N,11/20/17

The density x of the sodium in the intercalation layers can be altered electrochemically, directly changing the number of conduction electrons on the triangular Co layers(4). Recent electron diffraction measurements reveal a kaleidoscope of Na+ ion patterns as a function of concentration(5). Here we use single-crystal neutron diffraction supported by numerical simulations to determine the long-range three-dimensional superstructures of these ions. We show that the sodium ordering and its associated distortion field are governed by pure electrostatics, and that the organizational principle is the stabilization of charge droplets that order long range at some simple fractional fillings. Our results provide a good starting point to understand the electronic properties in terms of a Hubbard hamiltonian(6) that takes into account the electrostatic potential from the Na superstructures. The resulting depth of potential wells in the Co layer is greater than the single-particle hopping kinetic energy and as a consequence, holes preferentially occupy the lowest potential regions. Thus we conclude that the Na+ ion patterning has a decisive role in the transport and magnetic properties.","CEA Saclay, CNRS,URA 2464, MIPPU,DSM,DRECAM,SPEC, Serv Phys Etat Condense, F-91191 Gif Sur Yvette, France; Univ Liverpool, Oliver Lodge Lab, Dept Phys, Liverpool L69 7ZE, Merseyside, England; Hahn Meitner Inst Berlin GmbH, D-14109 Berlin, Germany; Tech Univ Berlin, Inst Festkorperphys, D-10623 Berlin, Germany; Rutherford Appleton Lab, ISIS Facil, Didcot OX11 0QX, Oxon, England; Univ Oxford, Clarendon Lab, Oxford OX1 3PU, England; Univ Bristol, HH Wills Phys Lab, Bristol BS8 1TL, Avon, England; European Synchrotron Radiat Facil, F-38043 Grenoble, France","Roger, M (reprint author), CEA Saclay, CNRS,URA 2464, MIPPU,DSM,DRECAM,SPEC, Serv Phys Etat Condense, PC 135, F-91191 Gif Sur Yvette, France.",roger@drecam.saclay.cea.fr,"Morris, David Jonathan Pryce/D-9183-2011; Feyerherm, Ralf/F-5487-2013; Hoffmann, Jens-Uwe/J-6035-2013; Shannon, Nic/N-3874-2014; Tennant, David/Q-2497-2015","Morris, David Jonathan Pryce/0000-0002-4785-7541; Feyerherm, Ralf/0000-0003-3034-4210; Hoffmann, Jens-Uwe/0000-0002-3651-958X; Shannon, Nic/0000-0001-9258-1583; Tennant, David/0000-0002-9575-3368; Lake, Bella/0000-0003-0034-0964",,,,27,144,145,5,99,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,8-Feb,2007,445,7128,,,,,631,634,,10.1038/nature05531,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,133UM,WOS:000244039400040,17287806,No,,,11/20/17

The most dramatic climate event since the onset of the collision of India and Asia is the Eocene - Oligocene transition, an abrupt cooling step associated with the onset of glaciation in Antarctica 34 million years ago(7-9). However, the influence of this global event on Asian environments is poorly understood. Here we use magnetostratigraphy and cyclostratigraphy to show that aridification, which is indicated by the disappearance of playa lake deposits in the northeastern Tibetan plateau, occurred precisely at the time of the Eocene - Oligocene transition. Our findings suggest that this global transition is linked to significant aridification and cooling in continental Asia recorded by palaeontological and palaeoenvironmental changes(10-12), and thus support the idea that global cooling is associated with the Eocene - Oligocene transition(13-15).

The marine record of this transition has been extensively studied. However, significantly less research has focused on continental climate change at the time, yielding partly inconsistent results on the magnitude and timing of the changes(2-8). Here we use a combination of in vivo stable isotope compositions of fossil tooth enamel with diagenetic stable isotope compositions of fossil bone to derive a high-resolution ( about 40,000 years) continental temperature record for the Eocene - Oligocene transition. We find a large drop in mean annual temperature of 8.2 +/- 3.1 degrees C over about 400,000 years, the possibility of a small increase in temperature seasonality, and no resolvable change in aridity across the transition. The large change in mean annual temperature, exceeding changes in sea surface temperatures at comparable latitudes(9,10) and possibly delayed in time with respect to marine changes by up to 400,000 years, explains the faunal turnover for gastropods, amphibians and reptiles, whereas most mammals in the region were unaffected.

Striatal projection neurons target the substantia nigra pars reticulata ( direct pathway) or the lateral globus pallidus ( indirect pathway). Imbalances between neural activity in these two pathways have been proposed to underlie the profound motor deficits observed in Parkinson's disease and Huntington's disease(3,4). However, little is known about differences in cellular and synaptic properties in these circuits. Indeed, current hypotheses suggest that these cells express similar forms of synaptic plasticity(5,6). Here we show that excitatory synapses onto indirect-pathway medium spiny neurons (MSNs) exhibit higher release probability and larger N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor currents than direct-pathway synapses. Moreover, indirect-pathway MSNs selectively express endocannabinoid-mediated long-term depression (eCB-LTD), which requires dopamine D2 receptor activation. In models of Parkinson's disease, indirect-pathway eCB-LTD is absent but is rescued by a D2 receptor agonist or inhibitors of endocannabinoid degradation. Administration of these drugs together in vivo reduces parkinsonian motor deficits, suggesting that endocannabinoid-mediated depression of indirect-pathway synapses has a critical role in the control of movement. These findings have implications for understanding the normal functions of the basal ganglia, and also suggest approaches for the development of therapeutic drugs for the treatment of striatal-based brain disorders.","Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Nancy Pritzker Lab, Dept Psychiat & Behav Sci, Stanford, CA 94305 USA","Malenka, RC (reprint author), Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Nancy Pritzker Lab, Dept Psychiat & Behav Sci, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",malenka@stanford.edu,,,,,,30,396,411,4,44,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,8-Feb,2007,445,7128,,,,,643,647,,10.1038/nature05506,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,133UM,WOS:000244039400043,17287809,No,Y,N,11/20/17

The underlying cause of the epidermal acanthosis in psoriasis is still largely unknown. Recently, interleukin (IL)-23, a cytokine involved in the development of IL-17-producing T helper cells (T(H)17 cells)(2,3), was found to have a potential function in the pathogenesis of psoriasis(4,5). Here we show that IL-22 is preferentially produced by T(H)17 cells and mediates the acanthosis induced by IL-23. We found that IL-23 or IL-6 can directly induce the production of IL-22 from both murine and human naive T cells. However, the production of IL-22 and IL-17 from T(H)17 cells is differentially regulated. Transforming growth factor-beta, although crucial for IL-17 production, actually inhibits IL-22 production. Furthermore, IL-22 mediates IL-23-induced acanthosis and dermal inflammation through the activation of Stat3 ( signal transduction and activators of transcription 3) in vivo. Our results suggest that T(H)17 cells, through the production of both IL-22 and IL-17, might have essential functions in host defence and in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases such as psoriasis. IL-22, as an effector cytokine produced by T cells, mediates the crosstalk between the immune system and epithelial cells.","Genentech Inc, Dept Immunol, San Francisco, CA 94080 USA; Genentech Inc, Dept Pathol, San Francisco, CA 94080 USA","Ouyang, WJ (reprint author), Genentech Inc, Dept Immunol, San Francisco, CA 94080 USA.",ouyang.wenjun@gene.com,"Zheng, Yan/A-6993-2008","Zheng, Yan/0000-0002-7002-277X; Ouyang, Wenjun/0000-0002-1811-5864",,,,30,1066,1145,8,53,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,8-Feb,2007,445,7128,,,,,648,651,,10.1038/nature05505,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,133UM,WOS:000244039400044,17187052,No,Y,N,11/20/17

It has been assumed that the phytohormone cytokinin has a positive role in shoot meristem function(2-4). A severe reduction in the size of meristems in a mutant that is defective in all of its cytokinin receptors has provided compelling evidence that cytokinin is required for meristem activity(5,6). Here, we report a novel regulation of meristem activity, which is executed by the meristem-specific activation of cytokinins. The LONELY GUY ( LOG) gene of rice is required to maintain meristem activity and its loss of function causes premature termination of the shoot meristem. LOG encodes a novel cytokinin-activating enzyme that works in the final step of bioactive cytokinin synthesis. Revising the long-held idea of multistep reactions, LOG directly converts inactive cytokinin nucleotides to the free-base forms, which are biologically active, by its cytokinin-specific phosphoribohydrolase activity. LOG messenger RNA is specifically localized in shoot meristem tips, indicating the activation of cytokinins in a specific developmental domain.

Consequently, p53 mutations increase cell proliferation and survival, and in some settings promote genomic instability and resistance to certain chemotherapies(3). To determine the consequences of reactivating the p53 pathway in tumours, we used RNA interference (RNAi) to conditionally regulate endogenous p53 expression in a mosaic mouse model of liver carcinoma(4,5). We show that even brief reactivation of endogenous p53 in p53-deficient tumours can produce complete tumour regressions. The primary response to p53 was not apoptosis, but instead involved the induction of a cellular senescence program that was associated with differentiation and the upregulation of inflammatory cytokines. This program, although producing only cell cycle arrest in vitro, also triggered an innate immune response that targeted the tumour cells in vivo, thereby contributing to tumour clearance. Our study indicates that p53 loss can be required for the maintenance of aggressive carcinomas, and illustrates how the cellular senescence program can act together with the innate immune system to potently limit tumour growth.","Cold Spring Harbor Lab, Cold Spring Harbor, NY 11724 USA; Cold Spring Harbor Lab, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Cold Spring Harbor, NY 11724 USA; Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Div Mol Pathol, New York, NY 10021 USA","Lowe, SW (reprint author), Cold Spring Harbor Lab, POB 100, Cold Spring Harbor, NY 11724 USA.",lowe@cshl.edu,"Dickins, Ross/K-2852-2012; Tang, Amy/L-3226-2016","Dickins, Ross/0000-0003-4112-5304; Tang, Amy/0000-0002-5772-2878; Krizhanovsky, Valery/0000-0002-3977-5482; Hernando, Eva/0000-0003-1023-0312","NCI NIH HHS [P01 CA087497, P30 CA008748]",,,30,1152,1189,10,115,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,8-Feb,2007,445,7128,,,,,656,660,,10.1038/nature05529,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,133UM,WOS:000244039400046,17251933,No,Y,N,11/20/17

Mouse models of human cancers have recently demonstrated that continuous expression of a dominantly acting oncogene ( for example, Hras, Kras and Myc) is often required for tumour maintenance(2-5); this phenotype is referred to as oncogene addiction(6). This concept has received clinical validation by the development of active anticancer drugs that specifically inhibit the function of oncoproteins such as BCR-ABL, c-KIT and EGFR(7-10). Identifying additional gene mutations that are required for tumour maintenance may therefore yield clinically useful targets for new cancer therapies. Although loss of p53 function is a common feature of human cancers(11), it is not known whether sustained inactivation of this or other tumour suppressor pathways is required for tumour maintenance. To explore this issue, we developed a Cre-loxP-based strategy to temporally control tumour suppressor gene expression in vivo. Here we show that restoring endogenous p53 expression leads to regression of autochthonous lymphomas and sarcomas in mice without affecting normal tissues. The mechanism responsible for tumour regression is dependent on the tumour type, with the main consequence of p53 restoration being apoptosis in lymphomas and suppression of cell growth with features of cellular senescence in sarcomas. These results support efforts to treat human cancers by way of pharmacological reactivation of p53.","MIT, Ctr Canc Res, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Dept Radiat Oncol, Boston, MA 02129 USA; Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Ctr Mol Imaging Res, Boston, MA 02129 USA; Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Boston, MA 02115 USA; Howard Hughes Med Inst, Chevy Chase, MD 20815 USA","Jacks, T (reprint author), MIT, Ctr Canc Res, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA.",tjacks@mit.edu,"Grimm, Jan/B-1937-2008; Ventura, Andrea/F-1789-2011","Ventura, Andrea/0000-0003-4320-9907; /0000-0003-0828-4143",,,,31,940,972,4,137,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,8-Feb,2007,445,7128,,,,,661,665,,10.1038/nature05541,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,133UM,WOS:000244039400047,17251932,No,Y,N,11/20/17

The specificity and efficiency of repression is ensured by the formation of a stable complex between non-coding RNA and the major promoter, direct interaction of the non-coding RNA with the general transcription factor IIB and dissociation of the preinitiation complex from the major promoter. By using in vivo and in vitro assays such as inducible and reconstituted transcription, RNA bandshifts, RNA interference, chromatin immunoprecipitation and RNA immunoprecipitation, we show that the regulatory transcript produced from the minor promoter has a critical function in an epigenetic mechanism of promoter-specific transcriptional repression.","Univ Oxford, Sir William Dunn Sch Pathol, Oxford OX1 3RE, England; Inst Genet & Biol Mol & Cellulaire, F-67404 Illkirch Graffenstaden, France; Univ Aveiro, Dept Biol, P-3810193 Aveiro, Portugal","Akoulitchev, A (reprint author), Univ Oxford, Sir William Dunn Sch Pathol, S Parks Rd, Oxford OX1 3RE, England.",alexandre.akoulitchev@path.ox.ac.uk,,"Martianov, Igor/0000-0001-6108-2036",Medical Research Council [G0200452]; Wellcome Trust,,,21,383,425,2,39,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,8-Feb,2007,445,7128,,,,,666,670,,10.1038/nature05519,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,133UM,WOS:000244039400048,17237763,No,,,11/20/17

Although methyltransferases that promote DNA methylation are well characterized, the molecular mechanism underlying active DNA demethylation is poorly understood and controversial(1,2). Here we show that Gadd45a ( growth arrest and DNA-damage-inducible protein 45 alpha), a nuclear protein involved in maintenance of genomic stability, DNA repair and suppression of cell growth 3,4, has a key role in active DNA demethylation. Gadd45a overexpression activates methylation-silenced reporter plasmids and promotes global DNA demethylation. Gadd45a knockdown silences gene expression and leads to DNA hypermethylation. During active demethylation of oct4 in Xenopus laevis oocytes(5), Gadd45a is specifically recruited to the site of demethylation. Active demethylation occurs by DNA repair and Gadd45a interacts with and requires the DNA repair endonuclease XPG. We conclude that Gadd45a relieves epigenetic gene silencing by promoting DNA repair, which erases methylation marks.","German Canc Res Ctr, Div Mol Embryol, D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany","Niehrs, C (reprint author), German Canc Res Ctr, Div Mol Embryol, Neuenheimer Feld 280, D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany.",niehrs@dkfz.de,,"Barreto, Guillermo/0000-0002-7777-4712",,,,29,448,479,7,47,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,8-Feb,2007,445,7128,,,,,671,675,,10.1038/nature05515,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,133UM,WOS:000244039400049,17268471,No,,,11/20/17

In the absence of MUTE, meristemoids abort after excessive asymmetric divisions and fail to differentiate stomata. Constitutive overexpression of MUTE directs the entire epidermis to adopt guard cell identity. MUTE has two paralogues: FAMA, a regulator of guard cell morphogenesis, and SPEECHLESS (SPCH). We show that SPCH directs the first asymmetric division that initiates stomatal lineage. Together, SPCH, MUTE and FAMA bHLH proteins control stomatal development at three consecutive steps: initiation, meristemoid differentiation and guard cell morphogenesis.

POT1 ( protection of telomeres) protein binds the single-stranded G-rich DNA overhangs at human chromosome ends and suppresses unwanted DNA repair activities. TPP1 is a previously identified binding partner of POT1 that has been proposed to form part of a six-protein shelterin complex at telomeres. Here, the crystal structure of a domain of human TPP1 reveals an oligonucleotide/oligosaccharide-binding fold that is structurally similar to the beta-subunit of the telomere end-binding protein of a ciliated protozoan, suggesting that TPP1 is the missing beta-subunit of human POT1 protein. Telomeric DNA end-binding proteins have generally been found to inhibit rather than stimulate the action of the chromosome end-replicating enzyme, telomerase. In contrast, we find that TPP1 and POT1 form a complex with telomeric DNA that increases the activity and processivity of the human telomerase core enzyme. We propose that POT1 - TPP1 switches from inhibiting telomerase access to the telomere, as a component of shelterin, to serving as a processivity factor for telomerase during telomere extension.","Univ Michigan, Sch Med, Dept Biol Chem, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; Univ Colorado, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Dept Chem & Biochem, Boulder, CO 80309 USA","Lei, M (reprint author), Univ Michigan, Sch Med, Dept Biol Chem, MSRBIII 5301D,1150 W Med Ctr Dr, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",leim@umich.edu,"Wang, Feng/B-2474-2012",,,,,38,356,376,0,29,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,1-Feb,2007,445,7127,,,,,506,510,,10.1038/nature05454,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,131KI,WOS:000243867300036,17237768,No,,,11/20/17

However, by coupling a superconducting quantum bit ( qubit) to signals on a microwave transmission line, it is possible to construct an integrated circuit in which the presence or absence of even a single photon can have a dramatic effect. Such a system(1) can be described by circuit quantum electrodynamics ( QED) - the circuit equivalent of cavity QED, where photons interact with atoms or quantum dots. Previously, circuit QED devices were shown to reach the resonant strong coupling regime, where a single qubit could absorb and re-emit a single photon many times(2). Here we report a circuit QED experiment in the strong dispersive limit, a new regime where a single photon has a large effect on the qubit without ever being absorbed. The hallmark of this strong dispersive regime is that the qubit transition energy can be resolved into a separate spectral line for each photon number state of the microwave field. The strength of each line is a measure of the probability of finding the corresponding photon number in the cavity. This effect is used to distinguish between coherent and thermal fields, and could be used to create a photon statistics analyser. As no photons are absorbed by this process, it should be possible to generate non-classical states of light by measurement and perform qubit - photon conditional logic, the basis of a logic bus for a quantum computer.","Yale Univ, Dept Appl Phys, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; Yale Univ, Dept Phys, New Haven, CT 06520 USA","Schoelkopf, RJ (reprint author), Yale Univ, Dept Appl Phys, New Haven, CT 06520 USA.",Robert.Schoelkopf@yale.edu,"Majer, Johannes/C-1864-2008; Blais, Alexandre/E-3315-2010; Schoelkopf, Robert/J-8178-2012; Wallraff, Andreas/C-2130-2009","Majer, Johannes/0000-0002-5192-1809; Blais, Alexandre/0000-0002-0591-2012; Wallraff, Andreas/0000-0002-3476-4485; Frunzio, Luigi/0000-0002-0272-5481",,,,30,431,436,4,75,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,1-Feb,2007,445,7127,,,,,515,518,,10.1038/nature05461,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,131KI,WOS:000243867300038,17268464,No,Y,N,11/20/17

Here we show that information about the location of a macrocycle in a rotaxane - a molecular ring threaded onto a molecular axle - can be used, on the input of light energy, to alter the kinetics of the shuttling of the macrocycle between two compartments on the axle. For an ensemble of such molecular machines, the macrocycle distribution is directionally driven away from its equilibrium value without ever changing the relative binding affinities of the ring for the different parts of the axle. The selective transport of particles between two compartments by brownian motion in this way bears similarities to the hypothetical task performed without an energy input by a 'demon' in Maxwell's famous thought experiment(16-19).

For example, direct evaporation of rain contributes significantly to the heat and moisture budgets of clouds(5), but few observations of these processes are available(6). Similarly, the relative contributions to atmospheric moisture over land from local evaporation and humidity from oceanic sources are uncertain(3,7). Lighter isotopes of water vapour preferentially evaporate whereas heavier isotopes preferentially condense(8-10) and the isotopic composition of ocean water is known. Here we use this information combined with global measurements of the isotopic composition of tropospheric water vapour from the Tropospheric Emission Spectrometer (TES) aboard the Aura spacecraft(11,12), to investigate aspects of the atmospheric hydrological cycle that are not well constrained by observations of precipitation or atmospheric vapour content. Our measurements of the isotopic composition of water vapour near tropical clouds suggest that rainfall evaporation contributes significantly to lower troposphere humidity, with typically 20% and up to 50% of rainfall evaporating near convective clouds. Over the tropical continents the isotopic signature of tropospheric water vapour differs significantly from that of precipitation(8,10,13), suggesting that convection of vapour from both oceanic sources and evapotranspiration are the dominant moisture sources.

The derived community was more stable and more productive than the ancestral community. Our results show that evolution in a spatially structured environment can stabilize interactions between species, provoke marked changes in their symbiotic nature and affect community function.","Univ Auckland, Sch Biol Sci, Auckland 1, New Zealand; Tech Univ Denmark, Infect Microbiol Grp, Biocentrum DTU, DK-2800 Lyngby, Denmark","Rainey, PB (reprint author), Univ Auckland, Sch Biol Sci, Private Bag 92019, Auckland 1, New Zealand.",p.rainey@auckland.ac.nz,"Rainey, Paul/A-3207-2008","Rainey, Paul/0000-0003-0879-5795",,,,30,245,257,16,169,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,1-Feb,2007,445,7127,,,,,533,536,,10.1038/nature05514,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,131KI,WOS:000243867300042,17268468,No,Y,N,11/20/17

An asymmetric division in the epidermis of plants initiates a lineage that ultimately produces stomatal guard cells. Stomata are pores in the epidermis that serve as the main conduits for gas exchange between plants and the atmosphere; they are critical for photosynthesis and exert a major influence on global carbon and water cycles(1). Recent studies implicated intercellular signalling in preventing the inappropriate production of stomatal complexes(2-4). Genes required to make stomata, however, remained elusive. Here we report the identification of a gene, SPEECHLESS (SPCH), encoding a basic helix - loop helix ( bHLH) transcription factor that is necessary and sufficient for the asymmetric divisions that establish the stomatal lineage in Arabidopsis thaliana. We demonstrate that SPCH and two paralogues are successively required for the initiation, proliferation and terminal differentiation of cells in the stomatal lineage. The stomatal bHLHs define a molecular pathway sufficient to create one of the key cell types in plants. Similar molecules and regulatory mechanisms are used during muscle and neural development(5,6), highlighting a conserved use of closely related bHLHs for cell fate specification and differentiation.","Stanford Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Stanford, CA 94305 USA","Bergmann, DC (reprint author), Stanford Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",dbergmann@stanford.edu,,,,,,20,206,230,4,54,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,1-Feb,2007,445,7127,,,,,537,540,,10.1038/nature05491,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,131KI,WOS:000243867300043,17183265,No,Y,N,11/20/17

TRPA1 is a member of the Transient Receptor Potential (TRP) family of ion channels and is expressed in nociceptive neurons(3-5). TRPA1 is activated by a variety of noxious stimuli, including cold temperatures, pungent natural compounds, and environmental irritants(6-11). How such diverse stimuli activate TRPA1 is not known. We observed that most compounds known to activate TRPA1 are able to covalently bind cysteine residues. Here we use click chemistry to show that derivatives of two such compounds, mustard oil and cinnamaldehyde, covalently bind mouse TRPA1. Structurally unrelated cysteine-modifying agents such as iodoacetamide (IA) and (2-aminoethyl) methanethiosulphonate ( MTSEA) also bind and activate TRPA1. We identified by mass spectrometry fourteen cytosolic TRPA1 cysteines labelled by IA, three of which are required for normal channel function. In excised patches, reactive compounds activated TRPA1 currents that were maintained at least 10 min after washout of the compound in calcium-free solutions. Finally, activation of TRPA1 by disulphide-bond-forming MTSEA is blocked by the reducing agent dithiothreitol (DTT). Collectively, our data indicate that covalent modification of reactive cysteines within TRPA1 can cause channel activation, rapidly signalling potential tissue damage through the pain pathway.","Scripps Res Inst, Dept Cell Biol, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; Scripps Res Inst, Dept Mol Biol, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; Scripps Res Inst, Dept Chem, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; Novartis Res Fdn, Genom Inst, San Diego, CA 92121 USA","Patapoutian, A (reprint author), Scripps Res Inst, Dept Cell Biol, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA.",ardem@scripps.edu,"Marion-Poll, Frederic/D-8882-2011","Marion-Poll, Frederic/0000-0001-6824-0180; Macpherson, Lindsey/0000-0002-1089-3733",,,,31,610,621,6,84,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,1-Feb,2007,445,7127,,,,,541,545,,10.1038/nature05544,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,131KI,WOS:000243867300044,17237762,No,Y,N,11/20/17

In channels, voltage change triggers a switch in conformation of the VSD, which drives gating in a separate pore domain, or, in channels lacking a pore domain, directly gates an ion pathway within the VSD4,5. Neither mechanism is well understood(6). In the Shaker potassium channel, mutation of the first arginine residue of the S4 helix to a smaller uncharged residue makes the VSD permeable to ions ('omega current') in the resting conformation ('S4 down')(7). Here we perform a structure-guided perturbation analysis of the omega conductance to map its VSD permeation pathway. We find that there are four omega pores per channel, which is consistent with one conduction path per VSD. Permeating ions from the extracellular medium enter the VSD at its peripheral junction with the pore domain, and then plunge into the core of the VSD in a curved conduction pathway.

This process, known as gating, is initiated by a cluster of positively charged residues on the fourth transmembrane segment (S4) of each VSD, which drives the VSD into a 'down state' at negative voltages and an 'up state' at more positive voltages(2). The crystal structure of Kv1.2 probably corresponds to the up state(3), but the local environment of S4 in the down state and its motion in voltage gating remains unresolved(4-6). Here we employed several conditional lethal/second-site suppressor yeast screens to determine the transmembrane packing of the VSD in the down state. This screen relies on the ability of KAT1, a eukaryotic Kv channel, to conduct potassium when its VSDs are in the down state, thereby rescuing potassium-transport-deficient yeast(7). Starting with KAT1 channels bearing conditional lethal mutations, we identified second-site suppressor mutations throughout the VSD that recover yeast growth. We then constructed a down state model of the channel using six pairs of interacting residues as structural constraints and verified this model by engineering suppressor mutations on the basis of spatial considerations. A comparison of this down state model with the up state Kv1.2 structure suggests that the VSDs undergo large rearrangements during gating, whereas the S4 segment remains positioned between the central pore and the remainder of the VSD in both states.","Univ Calif San Francisco, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Dept Physiol, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; Univ Calif San Francisco, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Dept Biochem, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; Univ Calif San Francisco, Grad Grp Biophys, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA","Jan, LY (reprint author), Univ Calif San Francisco, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Dept Physiol, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA.",lily.jan@ucsf.edu,"Grabe, Michael/B-3705-2009","Lai, Helen/0000-0003-4334-0243; Jan, Lily/0000-0003-3938-8498",,,,28,54,55,2,8,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,1-Feb,2007,445,7127,,,,,550,553,,10.1038/nature05494,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,131KI,WOS:000243867300046,17187053,No,,,11/20/17

Although bicoid was the first localized cytoplasmic determinant to be identified(1-4), little is known about how the mRNA is coupled to the microtubule-dependent transport pathway that targets it to the anterior, and it has been proposed that the mRNA is recognized by a complex of many redundant proteins, each of which binds to the localization element in the 3' untranslated region (UTR) with little or no specificity(5). Indeed, the only known RNA-binding protein that co-localizes with bicoid mRNA is Staufen, which binds non-specifically to double-stranded RNA in vitro(6,7). Here we show that mutants in all subunits of the ESCRT-II complex (VPS22, VPS25 and VPS36) abolish the final Staufen-dependent step in bicoid mRNA localization. ESCRT-II is a highly conserved component of the pathway that sorts ubiquitinated endosomal proteins into internal vesicles(8,9), and functions as a tumour-suppressor by removing activated receptors from the cytoplasm(10,11). However, the role of ESCRT-II in bicoid localization seems to be independent of endosomal sorting, because mutations in ESCRT-I and III components do not affect the targeting of bicoid mRNA. Instead, VPS36 functions by binding directly and specifically to stem-loop V of the bicoid 39 UTR through its amino-terminal GLUE domain(12), making it the first example of a sequence-specific RNA-binding protein that recognizes the bicoid localization signal. Furthermore, VPS36 localizes to the anterior of the oocyte in a bicoid-mRNA-dependent manner, and is required for the subsequent recruitment of Staufen to the bicoid complex. This function of ESCRT-II as an RNA-binding complex is conserved in vertebrates and may clarify some of its roles that are independent of endosomal sorting.","Univ Cambridge, Wellcome Trust Canc Res UK Gurdon Inst, Cambridge CB2 1QN, England; Univ Cambridge, Dept Genet, Cambridge CB2 1QN, England","St Johnston, D (reprint author), Univ Cambridge, Wellcome Trust Canc Res UK Gurdon Inst, Tennis Court Rd, Cambridge CB2 1QN, England.",ds139@mole.bio.cam.ac.uk,"St Johnston, Daniel/C-9568-2009","St Johnston, Daniel/0000-0001-5582-3301","Cancer Research UK [A14492]; Wellcome Trust [, 049818, 092096]",,,30,93,96,0,8,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,1-Feb,2007,445,7127,,,,,554,558,,10.1038/nature05503,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,131KI,WOS:000243867300047,17268469,No,,,11/20/17

Early studies in lower organisms have helped to establish the crucial role of telomerase and telomeric proteins in maintaining telomere length and protecting telomere ends(2-7). In Oxytricha nova, telomere G-overhangs are protected by the TEBP-alpha/beta heterodimer(3,4). Human telomeres contain duplex telomeric repeats with 3' single-stranded G-overhangs, and may fold into a t-loop structure that helps to shield them from being recognized as DNA breaks(8,9). Additionally, the TEBP-alpha homologue, POT1, which binds telomeric single-stranded DNA (ssDNA)(10), associates with multiple telomeric proteins ( for example, TPP1, TIN2, TRF1, TRF2 and RAP1) to form the six-protein telosome/shelterin(11,12) and other subcomplexes. These telomeric protein complexes in turn interact with diverse pathways to form the telomere interactome(13) for telomere maintenance. However, the mechanisms by which the POT1-containing telosome communicates with telomerase to regulate telomeres remain to be elucidated. Here we demonstrate that TPP1 is a putative mammalian homologue of TEBP-beta and contains a predicted amino-terminal oligonucleotide/ oligosaccharide binding (OB) fold. TPP1-POT1 association enhanced POT1 affinity for telomeric ssDNA. In addition, the TPP1 OB fold, as well as POT1 - TPP1 binding, seemed critical for POT1-mediated telomerelength control and telomere-end protection in human cells. Disruption of POT1 - TPP1 interaction by dominant negative TPP1 expression or RNA interference (RNAi) resulted in telomerelength alteration and DNA damage responses. Furthermore, we offer evidence that TPP1 associates with the telomerase in a TPP1-OB-fold-dependent manner, providing a physical link between telomerase and the telosome/shelterin complex. Our findings highlight the critical role of TPP1 in telomere maintenance, and support a yin - yang model in which TPP1 and POT1 function as a unit to protect human telomeres, by both positively and negatively regulating telomerase access to telomere DNA.","Baylor Coll Med, Verna & Marrs Mclean Dept Biochem & Mol Biol, Houston, TX 77030 USA","Zhou, SY (reprint author), Baylor Coll Med, Verna & Marrs Mclean Dept Biochem & Mol Biol, 1 Baylor Plaza, Houston, TX 77030 USA.",songyang@bcm.tmc.edu,,,,,,30,287,301,0,24,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,1-Feb,2007,445,7127,,,,,559,562,,10.1038/nature05469,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,131KI,WOS:000243867300048,17237767,No,,,11/20/17

This unexplained 'energy crisis' represents a major gap in our understanding of these planets' atmospheres. An important candidate for the source of the missing energy is the magnetosphere(1,2,4,7-9), which injects energy mostly in the polar regions of the planet. This polar energy input is believed to be sufficient to explain the observed temperatures(9), provided that it is efficiently redistributed globally by winds(4,8), a process that is not well understood. Here we show, using a numerical model(4), that the net effect of the winds driven by the polar energy inputs is not to heat but to cool the low-latitude thermosphere. This surprising result allows us to rule out known polar energy inputs as the solution to the energy crisis at Saturn.

The quantum interpretation of bunching relies on the constructive interference between amplitudes involving two indistinguishable photons, and its additive character is intimately linked to the Bose nature of photons. Advances in atom cooling and detection have led to the observation and full characterization of the atomic analogue of the HBT effect with bosonic atoms(4-6). By contrast, fermions should reveal an antibunching effect ( a tendency to avoid each other). Antibunching of fermions is associated with destructive two-particle interference, and is related to the Pauli principle forbidding more than one identical fermion to occupy the same quantum state. Here we report an experimental comparison of the fermionic and bosonic HBT effects in the same apparatus, using two different isotopes of helium: He-3 ( a fermion) and He-4 ( a boson). Ordinary attractive or repulsive interactions between atoms are negligible; therefore, the contrasting bunching and antibunching behaviour that we observe can be fully attributed to the different quantum statistics of each atomic species. Our results show how atom - atom correlation measurements can be used to reveal details in the spatial density(7,8) or momentum correlations(9) in an atomic ensemble. They also enable the direct observation of phase effects linked to the quantum statistics of a many-body system, which may facilitate the study of more exotic situations(10).","Univ Paris Sud, Lab Charles Fabry, Inst Opt, CNRS, F-91127 Palaiseau, France; Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Ctr Laser, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands","Vassen, W (reprint author), Univ Paris Sud, Lab Charles Fabry, Inst Opt, CNRS, Campus Polytech RD 128, F-91127 Palaiseau, France.",w.vassen@few.vu.nl; christoph.westbrook@institutoptique.fr,"Westbrook, Christoph/B-6092-2009; Perrin, Aurelien/C-2109-2008","Westbrook, Christoph/0000-0002-6490-0468; Perrin, Aurelien/0000-0001-5195-438X; Vassen, Wim/0000-0002-3785-4865; Krachmalnicoff, Valentina/0000-0002-5484-5338",,,,30,204,204,1,45,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,25-Jan,2007,445,7126,,,,,402,405,,10.1038/nature05513,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,128WD,WOS:000243689500033,17251973,No,Y,N,11/20/17

Such local cues pointing towards the location of the source are not always available at macroscopic scales because mixing in a flowing medium breaks up regions of high concentration into random and disconnected patches. Thus, animals sensing odours in air or water detect them only intermittently as patches sweep by on the wind or currents(2-6). A macroscopic searcher must devise a strategy of movement based on sporadic cues and partial information. Here we propose a search algorithm, which we call 'infotaxis', designed to work under such conditions. Any search process can be thought of as acquisition of information on source location; for infotaxis, information plays a role similar to concentration in chemotaxis. The infotaxis strategy locally maximizes the expected rate of information gain. We demonstrate its efficiency using a computational model of odour plume propagation and experimental data on mixing flows(7). Infotactic trajectories feature 'zigzagging' and 'casting' paths similar to those observed in the flight of moths(8). The proposed search algorithm is relevant to the design of olfactory robots(9-11), but the general idea of infotaxis can be applied more broadly in the context of searching with sparse information.","Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Kavli Inst Theoret Phys, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; Inst Pasteur, CNRS, URA 2171, F-75724 Paris 15, France; Univ Aix Marseille 1, F-13384 Marseille, France","Shraiman, BI (reprint author), Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Kavli Inst Theoret Phys, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA.",shraiman@kitp.ucsb.edu,,,,,,31,244,252,4,85,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,25-Jan,2007,445,7126,,,,,406,409,,10.1038/nature05464,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,128WD,WOS:000243689500034,17251974,No,Y,N,11/20/17

There is currently widespread interest in developing new types of spintronic devices based on industrially relevant semiconductors, in which a spin-polarized current flows through a lateral channel between a spin-polarized source and drain(1,2). However, the transformation of spin information into large electrical signals is limited by spin relaxation, so that the magnetoresistive signals are below 1% ( ref. 2). Here we report large magnetoresistance effects (61% at 5 K), which correspond to large output signals ( 65 mV), in devices where the non-magnetic channel is a multiwall carbon nanotube that spans a 1.5 mu m gap between epitaxial electrodes of the highly spin polarized(3,4) manganite La0.7Sr0.3MnO3. This spintronic system combines a number of favourable properties that enable this performance; the long spin lifetime in nanotubes due to the small spin - orbit coupling of carbon; the high Fermi velocity in nanotubes that limits the carrier dwell time; the high spin polarization in the manganite electrodes, which remains high right up to the manganite - nanotube interface; and the resistance of the interfacial barrier for spin injection. We support these conclusions regarding the interface using density functional theory calculations. The success of our experiments with such chemically and geometrically different materials should inspire new avenues in materials selection for future spintronics applications.","Univ Cambridge, Dept Mat Sci, Cambridge CB2 3QZ, England; Univ Cambridge, Dept Earth Sci, Cambridge CB2 3EQ, England; CSIC, Inst Ciencia Mat Barcelona, E-08193 Barcelona, Spain; Univ Cambridge, Cavendish Lab, Cambridge CB3 0HE, England; Univ Cambridge, Nanosci Ctr, Cambridge CB3 0FF, England; CNRS Thales TRT, Unite Mixte Phys, F-91405 Orsay, France","Mathur, ND (reprint author), Univ Cambridge, Dept Mat Sci, Pembroke St, Cambridge CB2 3QZ, England.",ndm12@cam.ac.uk,"Pruneda, Miguel/A-4077-2008; Burnell, Gavin/C-8950-2009; Hueso, Luis/C-8713-2009; Cavendish, TCM/C-9489-2009; Littlewood, Peter/B-7746-2008; Artacho, Emilio/G-2616-2015","Pruneda, Miguel/0000-0002-3621-6095; Burnell, Gavin/0000-0002-9486-0639; Hueso, Luis/0000-0002-7918-8047; Artacho, Emilio/0000-0001-9357-1547; Simons, Benjamin/0000-0002-3875-7071",,,,30,236,239,11,98,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,25-Jan,2007,445,7126,,,,,410,413,,10.1038/nature05507,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,128WD,WOS:000243689500035,17251975,No,Y,N,11/20/17

These units are formed by dykes intruding into rocks overlying a magma chamber, with lavas erupting at the ocean floor. Seismic reflection data acquired over young oceanic crust commonly image a reflector known as 'layer 2A', which is typically interpreted as defining the geologic boundary between lavas and dykes(1-3). An alternative hypothesis is that the reflector is associated with an alteration boundary within the lava unit(4-6). Many studies have used mapped variability in layer 2A thickness to make inferences regarding the geology of the oceanic crust, including volcanic construction, dyke intrusion and faulting(7-10). However, there has been no link between the geologic and seismological structure of oceanic crust except at a few deep drill holes. Here we show that, although the layer 2A reflector is imaged near the top of the sheeted dyke complex at fast-spreading crust located adjacent to the Hess Deep rift, it is imaged significantly above the sheeted dykes section at intermediate-spreading crust located near the Blanco transform fault. Although the lavas and underlying transition zone thicknesses differ by about a factor of two, the shallow seismic structure is remarkably similar at the two locations. This implies that seismic layer 2A cannot be used reliably to map the boundary between lavas and dykes in young oceanic crust. Instead we argue that the seismic layer 2A reflector corresponds to an alteration boundary that can be located either within the lava section or near the top of the sheeted dyke complex of oceanic crust.","Univ Texas, Inst Geophys, Jackson Sch Geosci, Austin, TX 78758 USA; Syracuse Univ, Dept Earth Sci, Syracuse, NY 13244 USA","Christeson, GL (reprint author), Univ Texas, Inst Geophys, Jackson Sch Geosci, JJ Pickle Res Campus,Mail Code R2200,10100 Burnet, Austin, TX 78758 USA.",gail@ig.utexas.edu,"Christeson, Gail/B-9967-2008; McIntosh, Kirk/G-6143-2010","Christeson, Gail/0000-0002-4749-4429; ",,,,30,38,38,0,11,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,25-Jan,2007,445,7126,,,,,418,421,,10.1038/nature05517,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,128WD,WOS:000243689500037,17251977,No,,,11/20/17

A remarkable eight of the 23 Nullarbor kangaroos are new, including two tree-kangaroos. The diverse herbivore assemblage implies substantially greater floristic diversity than that of the modern shrub steppe, but all other faunal and stable-isotope data indicate that the climate was very similar to today.

Furthermore, sequestrations of prey organelles are typically highly ephemeral(2) as a result of the inability of the organelle to remain functional in the absence of numerous nuclear-encoded genes involved in its regulation, division and function(3). The marine photosynthetic ciliate Myrionecta rubra (Lohmann 1908) Jankowski 1976 ( the same as Mesodinium rubrum)(4) is known to possess organelles of cryptophyte origin(5-9), which has led to debate concerning their status as permanent symbiotic or temporary sequestered fixtures(5-13). Recently, M. rubra has been shown to steal plastids ( that is, chloroplasts) from the cryptomonad, Geminigera cryophila, and prey nuclei were observed to accumulate after feeding(10). Here we show that cryptophyte nuclei in M. rubra are retained for up to 30 days, are transcriptionally active and service plastids derived from multiple cryptophyte cells. Expression of a cryptophyte nuclear-encoded gene involved in plastid function declined in M. rubra as the sequestered nuclei disappeared from the population. Cytokinesis, plastid performance and their replication are dependent on recurrent stealing of cryptophyte nuclei.

B and B. C to infer A. C), and is thus essential to logical reasoning. First described as a developmental milestone in children(1), TI has since been reported in nonhuman primates(2-4), rats(5,6) and birds(7-10). Still, how animals acquire and represent transitive relationships and why such abilities might have evolved remain open problems. Here we show that male fish (Astatotilapia burtoni) can successfully make inferences on a hierarchy implied by pairwise fights between rival males. These fish learned the implied hierarchy vicariously ( as 'bystanders'), by watching fights between rivals arranged around them in separate tank units. Our findings show that fish use TI when trained on socially relevant stimuli, and that they can make such inferences by using indirect information alone. Further, these bystanders seem to have both spatial and featural representations related to rival abilities, which they can use to make correct inferences depending on what kind of information is available to them. Beyond extending TI to fish and experimentally demonstrating indirect TI learning in animals, these results indicate that a universal mechanism underlying TI is unlikely. Rather, animals probably use multiple domain-specific representations adapted to different social and ecological pressures that they encounter during the course of their natural lives.","Stanford Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; Stanford Univ, Ctr Study Language & Informat, Stanford, CA 94305 USA","Grosenick, L (reprint author), Stanford Univ, Ctr Study Language & Informat, Ventura Hall,200 Panama St, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",logang@stanford.edu,,,,,,29,210,214,12,86,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,25-Jan,2007,445,7126,,,,,429,432,,10.1038/nature05511,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,128WD,WOS:000243689500040,17251980,No,Y,N,11/20/17

Calcineurin(2-4) and Ras(5-7) are known to have essential functions during T-cell activation. However, how the calcineurin signalling pathway is terminated in the process is still largely unknown. Although several endogenous inhibitors of calcineurin have been reported(8-13), none fulfils the criteria of a feedback inhibitor, as their expression is not responsive to TCR signalling. Here we identify an endogenous inhibitor of calcineurin, named Carabin, which also inhibits the Ras signalling pathway through its intrinsic Ras GTPase-activating protein (GAP) activity. Expression of Carabin is upregulated on TCR signalling in a manner that is sensitive to inhibitors of calcineurin, indicating that Carabin constitutes part of a negative regulatory loop for the intracellular TCR signalling pathway. Knockdown of Carabin by short interfering RNA led to a significant enhancement of interleukin-2 production by antigen-specific T cells in vitro and in vivo.

However, tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) against the human epidermal growth factor receptor ( HER) family show only limited activity against HER2-driven breast cancers, despite effective inhibition of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and HER2 in vivo(1-8). The reasons for this are unclear. Signalling in trans is a key feature of this multimember family and the critically important phosphatidylinositol-3- OH kinase ( PI( 3) K)/Akt pathway is driven predominantly through transphosphorylation of the kinase-inactive HER3 (refs 9, 10). Here we show that HER3 and consequently PI( 3) K/Akt signalling evade inhibition by current HER-family TKIs in vitro and in tumours in vivo. This is due to a compensatory shift in the HER3 phosphorylation - dephosphorylation equilibrium, driven by increased membrane HER3 expression driving the phosphorylation reaction and by reduced HER3 phosphatase activity impeding the dephosphorylation reaction. These compensatory changes are driven by Akt-mediated negative-feedback signalling. Although HER3 is not a direct target of TKIs, HER3 substrate resistance undermines their efficacy and has thus far gone undetected. The experimental abrogation of HER3 resistance by small interfering RNA knockdown restores potent pro-apoptotic activity to otherwise cytostatic HER TKIs, re-affirming the oncogene-addicted nature of HER2-driven tumours and the therapeutic promise of this oncoprotein target. However, because HER3 signalling is buffered against an incomplete inhibition of HER2 kinase, much more potent TKIs or combination strategies are required to silence oncogenic HER2 signalling effectively. The biologic marker with which to assess the efficacy of HER TKIs should be the transphosphorylation of HER3 rather than autophosphorylation.","Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Med, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Cellular & Mol Pharmacol, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA","Moasser, MM (reprint author), Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Med, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA.",mmoasser@medicine.ucsf.edu,,,"NCI NIH HHS [R01 CA122216, R01 CA122216-01A1]; NIAID NIH HHS [R01 AI044009]",,,30,570,591,7,39,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,25-Jan,2007,445,7126,,,,,437,441,,10.1038/nature05474,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,128WD,WOS:000243689500042,17206155,No,Y,N,11/20/17

Although rRNA transcriptional control by RNA polymerase I (Pol I) and associated factors is well studied, the lineage-specific mechanisms governing rRNA expression remain elusive(1). Runt-related transcription factors Runx1, Runx2 and Runx3 establish and maintain cell identity(2), and convey phenotypic information through successive cell divisions for regulatory events that determine cell cycle progression or exit in progeny cells(3). Here we establish that mammalian Runx2 not only controls lineage commitment and cell proliferation by regulating genes transcribed by RNA Pol II, but also acts as a repressor of RNA Pol I mediated rRNA synthesis. Within the condensed mitotic chromosomes we find that Runx2 is retained in large discrete foci at nucleolar organizing regions where rRNA genes reside. These Runx2 chromosomal foci are associated with open chromatin, colocalize with the RNA Pol I transcription factor UBF1, and undergo transition into nucleoli at sites of rRNA synthesis during interphase. Ribosomal RNA transcription and protein synthesis are enhanced by Runx2 deficiency that results from gene ablation or RNA interference, whereas induction of Runx2 specifically and directly represses rDNA promoter activity. Runx2 forms complexes containing the RNA Pol I transcription factors UBF1 and SL1, co-occupies the rRNA gene promoter with these factors in vivo, and affects local chromatin histone modifications at rDNA regulatory regions. Thus Runx2 is a critical mechanistic link between cell fate, proliferation and growth control. Our results suggest that lineage-specific control of ribosomal biogenesis may be a fundamental function of transcription factors that govern cell fate.","Univ Massachusetts, Sch Med, Dept Cell Biol, Worcester, MA 01655 USA; Univ Massachusetts, Sch Med, Ctr Canc, Worcester, MA 01655 USA; Univ Massachusetts, Sch Med, Program Mol Med, Worcester, MA 01655 USA; MIT, Dept Biol, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; Univ Concepcion, Dept Biol Mol, Fac Ciencias Biol, Concepcion, Chile","Stein, GS (reprint author), Univ Massachusetts, Sch Med, Dept Cell Biol, Worcester, MA 01655 USA.",gary.stein@umassmed.edu,,"Javed, Amjad/0000-0002-0847-8266; Zaidi, Kaleem/0000-0001-6664-5168",NIAMS NIH HHS [R01 AR049069],,,30,146,150,1,11,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,25-Jan,2007,445,7126,,,,,442,446,,10.1038/nature05473,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,128WD,WOS:000243689500043,17251981,No,,,11/20/17

Different APOBEC members use the same deamination activity to achieve diverse human biological functions. Deamination by an APOBEC protein called activation-induced cytidine deaminase ( AID) is critical for generating high-affinity antibodies(3), and deamination by APOBEC-3 proteins can inhibit retrotransposons and the replication of retroviruses such as human immunodeficiency virus and hepatitis B virus(4-7). Here we report the crystal structure of APO2. APO2 forms a rod-shaped tetramer that differs markedly from the square-shaped tetramer of the free nucleotide cytidine deaminase, with which APOBEC proteins share considerable sequence homology. In APO2, two long alpha-helices of a monomer structure prevent the formation of a square-shaped tetramer and facilitate formation of the rod-shaped tetramer via head-to-head interactions of two APO2 dimers. Extensive sequence homology among APOBEC family members allows us to test APO2 structure-based predictions using AID. We show that AID deamination activity is impaired by mutations predicted to interfere with oligomerization and substrate access. The structure suggests how mutations in patients with hyper-IgM-2 syndrome inactivate AID, resulting in defective antibody maturation.","Univ So Calif, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA","Chen, XJS (reprint author), Univ So Calif, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA.",xiaojiang.chen@usc.edu,,,,,,28,136,145,3,16,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,25-Jan,2007,445,7126,,,,,447,451,,10.1038/nature05492,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,128WD,WOS:000243689500044,17187054,No,,,11/20/17

In Drosophila, fasting larvae release large quantities of lipid from the fat body but it is unclear how and where this is processed. Here we identify the oenocyte as the principal cell type accumulating lipid droplets during starvation. Tissue-specific manipulations of the Slimfast amino-acid channel, the Lsd2 fat-storage regulator and the Brummer lipase indicate that oenocytes act downstream of the fat body. In turn, oenocytes are required for depleting stored lipid from the fat body during fasting. Hence, lipid-metabolic coupling between the fat body and oenocytes is bidirectional. When food is plentiful, oenocytes have critical roles in regulating growth, development and feeding behaviour. In addition, they specifically express many different lipid-metabolizing proteins, including Cyp4g1, an omega-hydroxylase regulating triacylglycerol composition. These findings provide evidence that some lipid-processing functions of the mammalian liver are performed in insects by oenocytes.","Churchill Hosp, Oxford Ctr Diabet Endocrinol & Metab, Oxford OX3 7LJ, England; Natl Inst Med Res, MRC, London NW7 1AA, England","Gould, AP (reprint author), Natl Inst Med Res, MRC, Mill Hill, London NW7 1AA, England.",agould@nimr.mrc.ac.uk,"Gould, Alex/A-7479-2010","Gould, Alex/0000-0002-6875-6985",Medical Research Council [MC_U117584237]; Wellcome Trust,,,49,170,172,0,27,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,18-Jan,2007,445,7125,,,,,275,280,,10.1038/nature05382,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,126HT,WOS:000243504700036,17136098,No,,,11/20/17

We identified two S phase CDK (S-CDK) phosphorylation sites in the budding yeast Sld3 protein that, together, are essential for DNA replication. Here we show that, when phosphorylated, these sites bind to the amino-terminal BRCT repeats of Dpb11. An Sld3 - Dpb11 fusion construct bypasses the requirement for both Sld3 phosphorylation and the N-terminal BRCT repeats of Dpb11. Co-expression of this fusion with a phospho-mimicking mutant in a second essential CDK substrate, Sld2, promotes DNA replication in the absence of S-CDK. Therefore, Sld2 and Sld3 are the minimal set of S-CDK targets required for DNA replication. DNA replication in cells lacking G1 phase CDK (G1-CDK) required expression of the Cdc7 kinase regulatory subunit, Dbf4, as well as Sld2 and Sld3 bypass.

The remainder is a mysterious 'dark matter' component, which does not interact via electromagnetism and thus neither emits nor reflects light. As dark matter cannot be seen directly using traditional observations, very little is currently known about its properties. It does interact via gravity, and is most effectively probed through gravitational lensing: the deflection of light from distant galaxies by the gravitational attraction of foreground mass concentrations(4,5). This is a purely geometrical effect that is free of astrophysical assumptions and sensitive to all matter - whether baryonic or dark(6,7). Here we show high-fidelity maps of the large-scale distribution of dark matter, resolved in both angle and depth. We find a loose network of filaments, growing over time, which intersect in massive structures at the locations of clusters of galaxies. Our results are consistent with predictions of gravitationally induced structure formation(8,9), in which the initial, smooth distribution of dark matter collapses into filaments then into clusters, forming a gravitational scaffold into which gas can accumulate, and stars can be built(10).","CALTECH, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA; CALTECH, Jet Prop Lab, Pasadena, CA 91109 USA; Lab Astrophys Marseille, F-13376 Marseille, France; Max Planck Inst Extraterr Phys, D-85748 Garching, Germany; Inst Astron, Edinburgh EH9 3HJ, Midlothian, Scotland; CNRS, CEA, Unite Mixte Rech, AIM, F-91191 Gif Sur Yvette, France; Univ Paris 07, CE Saclay, UMR 7158, F-91191 Gif Sur Yvette, France; Space Telescope Sci Inst, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA; Univ Paris 06, Inst Astrophys Paris, F-75014 Paris, France; Ctr Etud Saclay, CEA, DSM, DAPNIA,SEDI, F-91191 Gif Sur Yvette, France; Ehime Univ, Dept Phys, Matsuyama, Ehime 7908577, Japan; Univ Waterloo, Dept Phys & Astron, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada","Massey, R (reprint author), CALTECH, MC105-24,1200 E Calif Blvd, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA.",rjm@astro.caltech.edu,"Starck, Jean-Luc/D-9467-2011; Kneib, Jean-Paul/A-7919-2015","Starck, Jean-Luc/0000-0003-2177-7794; Kneib, Jean-Paul/0000-0002-4616-4989; Taylor, James/0000-0002-6639-4183; Koekemoer, Anton/0000-0002-6610-2048",,,,30,205,210,1,17,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,18-Jan,2007,445,7125,,,,,286,290,,10.1038/nature05497,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,126HT,WOS:000243504700038,17206154,No,,,11/20/17

Such alternatives offer the prospect of realizing magnets fabricated through controlled, low-temperature, solution-based chemistry, as opposed to high-temperature metallurgical routes, and also the possibility of tuning magnetic properties through synthesis. However, examples of magnetically ordered molecular materials at or near room temperature are extremely rare 3, and the properties of these materials are often capricious and difficult to reproduce. Here we present a versatile solution-based route to a new class of metal - organic materials exhibiting magnetic order well above room temperature. Reactions of the metal ( M) precursor complex bis(1,5-cyclooctadiene) nickel with three different organics A - TCNE ( tetracyanoethylene), TCNQ (7,7,8,8-tetracyanoquinodimethane) or DDQ (2,3-dichloro-5,6-dicyano-1,4-benzoquinone) - proceed via electron transfer from nickel to A and lead to materials containing Ni(II) ions and reduced forms of A in a 2: 1 Ni: A ratio - that is, opposite to that of conventional ( low Curie temperature) MA(2)-type magnets. These materials also contain oxygen-based species within their architectures. Magnetic characterization of the three compounds reveals spontaneous field-dependent magnetization and hysteresis at room temperature, with ordering temperatures well above ambient. The unusual stoichiometry and striking magnetic properties highlight these three compounds as members of a class of stable magnets that are at the interface between conventional inorganic magnets and genuine molecule-based magnets.","Univ Victoria, Dept Chem, Victoria, BC V8W 3V6, Canada; Univ British Columbia, Dept Chem, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z1, Canada","Hicks, RG (reprint author), Univ Victoria, Dept Chem, POB 3065 STN CSC, Victoria, BC V8W 3V6, Canada.",rhicks@uvic.ca,,,,,,30,107,109,3,74,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,18-Jan,2007,445,7125,,,,,291,294,,10.1038/nature05439,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,126HT,WOS:000243504700039,17230185,No,,,11/20/17

Organized networks of semiflexible actin filaments determine cell stiffness and transmit force during mechanotransduction, cytokinesis, cell motility and other cellular shape changes(1-3). Although numerous actin-binding proteins have been identified that organize networks, the mechanical properties of actin networks with physiological architectures and concentrations have been difficult to measure quantitatively. Studies of mechanical properties in vitro have found that crosslinked networks of actin filaments formed in solution exhibit stress stiffening arising from the entropic elasticity of individual filaments or crosslinkers resisting extension(4-8). Here we report reversible stress-softening behaviour in actin networks reconstituted in vitro that suggests a critical role for filaments resisting compression. Using a modified atomic force microscope to probe dendritic actin networks ( like those formed in the lamellipodia of motile cells), we observe stress stiffening followed by a regime of reversible stress softening at higher loads. This softening behaviour can be explained by elastic buckling of individual filaments under compression that avoids catastrophic fracture of the network. The observation of both stress stiffening and softening suggests a complex interplay between entropic and enthalpic elasticity in determining the mechanical properties of actin networks.","Univ Calif Berkeley, UC San Francisco UC Berkeley Joint Grad Grp Bioen, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Bioengn, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA","Fletcher, DA (reprint author), Univ Calif Berkeley, UC San Francisco UC Berkeley Joint Grad Grp Bioen, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",fletch@berkeley.edu,,,"NIGMS NIH HHS [R01 GM074751, R01 GM072736, R01 GM072736-05, R01 GM074751-01A2]",,,30,207,214,6,81,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,18-Jan,2007,445,7125,,,,,295,298,,10.1038/nature05459,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,126HT,WOS:000243504700040,17230186,No,,,11/20/17

There is much debate about how the IOD interacts with the El Nino/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the Asian monsoon, and recent changes in the historic ENSO - monsoon relationship(6) raise the possibility that the properties of the IOD may also be evolving. Improving our understanding of IOD events and their climatic impacts thus requires the development of records defining IOD activity in different climatic settings, including prehistoric times when ENSO and the Asian monsoon behaved differently from the present day. Here we use coral geochemical records from the equatorial eastern Indian Ocean to reconstruct surface-ocean cooling and drought during individual IOD events over the past similar to 6,500 years. We find that IOD events during the middle Holocene were characterized by a longer duration of strong surface ocean cooling, together with droughts that peaked later than those expected by El Nino forcing alone. Climate model simulations suggest that this enhanced cooling and drying was the result of strong cross-equatorial winds driven by the strengthened Asian monsoon of the middle Holocene. These IOD - monsoon connections imply that the socioeconomic impacts of projected future changes in Asian monsoon strength may extend throughout Australasia.","Australian Natl Univ, Res Sch Earth Sci, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia; Univ Wisconsin, Ctr Climat Res, Madison, WI 53706 USA; Chinese Acad Sci, Earth Environm Inst, Xian 710075, Peoples R China; Ocean Univ China, Qingdao 266003, Peoples R China; Indonesian Inst Sci, Res & Dev Ctr Geotechnol, Bandung 40135, Indonesia","Abram, NJ (reprint author), British Antarctic Survey, NERC, Cambridge CB3 0ET, England.",nabr@bas.ac.uk; michael.gagan@anu.edu.au,"McCulloch, Malcolm/C-3651-2009","McCulloch, Malcolm/0000-0003-1538-1558; Abram, Nerilie/0000-0003-1246-2344",,,,29,87,89,1,39,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,18-Jan,2007,445,7125,,,,,299,302,,10.1038/nature05477,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,126HT,WOS:000243504700041,17230187,No,,,11/20/17

Shoulder function depends on a balance of forces from muscles, ligaments and articular cartilages, as well as inertial, gravitational and aerodynamic loads on the wing(11). Here we show that the force balance system of the shoulder evolved from a primarily muscular mechanism to one in which the acrocoracohumeral ligament has a critical role.

These studies demonstrate that some aspects of Shh function are deeply conserved in vertebrate phylogeny, but also highlight how the evolution of Shh regulation may underlie major morphological changes during appendage evolution.","Univ Chicago, Dept Organismal Biol & Anat, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; Johns Hopkins Univ, Sch Med, Dept Mol Biol & Genet, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA; Field Museum Nat Hist, Chicago, IL 60605 USA","Shubin, NH (reprint author), Univ Chicago, Dept Organismal Biol & Anat, 1025 E 57th St, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.",nshubin@uchicago.edu,,,,,,21,71,72,1,38,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,18-Jan,2007,445,7125,,,,,311,314,,10.1038/nature05436,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,126HT,WOS:000243504700044,17187056,No,,,11/20/17

If subjects are required to remember a large number of complex motor sequences and plan to execute each of them individually, categorization of the sequences according to the specific temporal structure inherent in each subset of sequences serves to facilitate higher-order planning based on memory. Here we show, using these requirements, that cells in the lateral prefrontal cortex selectively exhibit activity for a specific category of behavioural sequences, and that categories of behaviours, embodied by different types of movement sequences, are represented in prefrontal cells during the process of planning. This cellular activity implies the generation of neural representations capable of storing structured event complexes at an abstract level, exemplifying the development of macro-structured action knowledge in the lateral prefrontal cortex(9).","Tohoku Univ, Sch Med, Dept Physiol, Sendai, Miyagi 9808575, Japan; Tamagawa Univ Res Inst, Brain Sci Res Ctr, Tokyo 1948610, Japan","Tanji, J (reprint author), Tohoku Univ, Sch Med, Dept Physiol, Sendai, Miyagi 9808575, Japan.",tanji@lab.tamagawa.ac.jp,,,,,,30,106,107,0,20,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,18-Jan,2007,445,7125,,,,,315,318,,10.1038/nature05470,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,126HT,WOS:000243504700045,17183266,No,,,11/20/17

The 1918 virus is also highly pathogenic in mice, and studies have identified a multigenic origin of this virulent phenotype in mice(2-4). However, these initial characterizations of the 1918 virus did not address the question of its pathogenic potential in primates. Here we demonstrate that the 1918 virus caused a highly pathogenic respiratory infection in a cynomolgus macaque model that culminated in acute respiratory distress and a fatal outcome. Furthermore, infected animals mounted an immune response, characterized by dysregulation of the antiviral response, that was insufficient for protection, indicating that atypical host innate immune responses may contribute to lethality. The ability of influenza viruses to modulate host immune responses, such as that demonstrated for the avian H5N1 influenza viruses(5), may be a feature shared by the virulent influenza viruses.","Univ Tokyo, Dept Microbiol & Immunol, Div Virol, Tokyo 1088639, Japan; Publ Hlth Agcy Canada, Special Pathogens Program Natl Microbiol Lab, Winnipeg, MB R3E 3R2, Canada; Univ Manitoba, Dept Immunol, Winnipeg, MB R3E 3R2, Canada; Univ Manitoba, Dept Med Microbiol, Winnipeg, MB R3E 3R2, Canada; Tottori Univ, Avian Zoonosis Res Ctr, Tottori 6808550, Japan; Univ Washington, Sch Med, Dept Microbiol, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; Univ Washington, Washington Natl Primate Res Ctr, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; Canadian Food Inspect Agcy, Natl Ctr Foreign Anim Dis, Canadian Sci Ctr Human & Anim Hlth, Winnipeg, MB R3E 3M4, Canada; Univ Tokyo, Inst Med Sci, Int Res Ctr Infect Dis, Tokyo 1088639, Japan; Japan Sci & Technol Agcy, CREST, Saitama 3220012, Japan; Univ Wisconsin, Dept Pathobiol Sci, Madison, WI 53706 USA","Kawaoka, Y (reprint author), Univ Tokyo, Dept Microbiol & Immunol, Div Virol, Tokyo 1088639, Japan.",kawaokay@svm.vetmed.wisc.edu,,,,,,30,552,580,9,53,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,18-Jan,2007,445,7125,,,,,319,323,,10.1038/nature05495,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,126HT,WOS:000243504700046,17230189,No,Y,N,11/20/17

The outcome of Toxoplasma infection is highly dependent on the strain type, as are many of its in vitro growth properties(1). Here we use genetic crosses between type II and III lines to show that strain-specific differences in the modulation of host cell transcription are mediated by a putative protein kinase, ROP16. Upon invasion by the parasite, this polymorphic protein is released from the apical organelles known as rhoptries and injected into the host cell, where it ultimately affects the activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription ( STAT) signalling pathways and consequent downstream effects on a key host cytokine, interleukin (IL)-12. Our findings provide a new mechanism for how an intracellular eukaryotic pathogen can interact with its host and reveal important differences in how different Toxoplasma lineages have evolved to exploit this interaction.","Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Dept Microbiol & Immunol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; Montana State Univ, Coll Agr, Dept Vet Mol Biol, Bozeman, MT 59717 USA","Boothroyd, JC (reprint author), Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Dept Microbiol & Immunol, Fairchild Bldg D305,300 Pasteur Dr, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",john.boothroyd@stanford.edu,"White, Michael/A-4978-2012","Saeij, Jeroen/0000-0003-0289-7109","NIAID NIH HHS [R01 AI021423, R01 AI021423-20]",,,24,293,317,2,23,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,18-Jan,2007,445,7125,,,,,324,327,,10.1038/nature05395,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,126HT,WOS:000243504700047,17183270,No,Y,N,11/20/17

At the onset of S phase, active CDK is essential for chromosomal DNA replication(1), although its precise role is unknown. In budding yeast ( Saccharomyces cerevisiae), the replication protein Sld2 (ref. 2) is an essential CDK substrate(3), but its phospho-mimetic form (Sld2-11D) alone neither affects cell growth(4) nor promotes DNA replication in the absence of CDK activity(4), suggesting that other essential CDK substrates promote DNA replication. Here we show that both an allele of CDC45 (JET1) and high-copy DPB11, in combination with Sld2-11D, separately confer CDK-independent DNA replication. Although Cdc45 is not an essential CDK substrate, CDK-dependent phosphorylation of Sld3, which associates with Cdc45 ( ref. 5), is essential and generates a binding site for Dpb11. Both the JET1 mutation and high-copy DPB11 by-pass the requirement for Sld3 phosphorylation in DNA replication. Because phosphorylated Sld2 binds to the carboxy-terminal pair of BRCT domains in Dpb11 ( ref. 4), we propose that Dpb11 connects phosphorylated Sld2 and Sld3 to facilitate interactions between replication proteins, such as Cdc45 and GINS. Our results demonstrate that CDKs regulate interactions between BRCT-domain-containing replication proteins and other phosphorylated proteins for the initiation of chromosomal DNA replication; similar regulation may take place in higher eukaryotes.","Res Org Informat & Syst, Natl Inst Genet, Div Microbial Genet, Shizuoka 4118540, Japan; SOKENDAI, Dept Genet, Shizuoka 4118540, Japan; CREST, Kawaguchi, Saitama 3320012, Japan","Araki, H (reprint author), Res Org Informat & Syst, Natl Inst Genet, Div Microbial Genet, Yata 1111 Mishima, Shizuoka 4118540, Japan.",hiaraki@lab.nig.ac.jp,"Kamimura, Yoichiro/M-2585-2017","Tanaka, Seiji/0000-0003-3882-3494",,,,29,267,268,0,15,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,18-Jan,2007,445,7125,,,,,328,332,,10.1038/nature05465,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,126HT,WOS:000243504700048,17167415,No,,,11/20/17

But, owing to its temporal and spatial variability, the global distribution of marine nitrogen fixation is difficult to determine from direct shipboard measurements. This uncertainty limits our understanding of the factors that influence nitrogen fixation, which may include iron, nitrogen-to-phosphorus ratios, and physical conditions such as temperature. Here we determine nitrogen fixation rates in the world's oceans through their impact on nitrate and phosphate concentrations in surface waters, using an ocean circulation model. Our results indicate that nitrogen fixation rates are highest in the Pacific Ocean, where water column denitrification rates are high but the rate of atmospheric iron deposition is low. We conclude that oceanic nitrogen fixation is closely tied to the generation of nitrogen-deficient waters in denitrification zones, supporting the view that nitrogen fixation stabilizes the oceanic inventory of fixed nitrogen over time.","Univ Washington, Sch Oceanog, Program Climate Change, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; Princeton Univ, Atmospher & Ocean Sci Program, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; Princeton Univ, Dept Geosci, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; Univ Calif Los Angeles, IGPP, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Atmospher & Ocean Sci, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; NOAA, Geophys Fluid Dynam Lab, Princeton, NJ 08542 USA","Deutsch, C (reprint author), Univ Washington, Sch Oceanog, Program Climate Change, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.",cdeutsch@ocean.washington.edu,"Gruber, Nicolas/B-7013-2009; Deutsch, Curtis/D-1703-2011; Dunne, John/F-8086-2012; Sigman, Daniel/A-2649-2008","Gruber, Nicolas/0000-0002-2085-2310; Dunne, John/0000-0002-8794-0489; Sigman, Daniel/0000-0002-7923-1973",,,,30,353,362,14,147,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,11-Jan,2007,445,7124,,,,,163,167,,10.1038/nature05392,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,124QF,WOS:000243384300042,17215838,No,Y,N,11/20/17

T beta 4 knockdown in the heart is accompanied by significant reduction in the pro-angiogenic cleavage product N-acetyl-seryl-aspartyl-lysyl-proline ( AcSDKP). Although injection of AcSDKP was unable to rescue T beta 4 mutant hearts, it significantly enhanced endothelial cell differentiation from adult epicardially derived precursor cells.

Some theoretical work suggests that dynamical processes in the densest inner regions of globular clusters may lead to the formation of black holes of similar to 1,000 solar masses(3). Other numerical simulations instead predict that stellar interactions will eject most or all of the black holes that form in globular clusters(1,2).

To assess the role of antiferromagnetism, it is essential to understand the doping and temperature dependence of the two-dimensional antiferromagnetic spin correlations. The phase diagram is asymmetric with respect to electron and hole doping, and for the comparatively less-studied electron-doped materials, the antiferromagnetic phase extends much further with doping(1,2) and appears to overlap with the superconducting phase. The archetypal electron-doped compound Nd2-xCexCuO4+/-delta (NCCO) shows bulk superconductivity above x approximate to 0.13 ( refs 3, 4), while evidence for antiferromagnetic order has been found up to x approximate to 0.17 ( refs 2, 5, 6). Here we report inelastic magnetic neutron-scattering measurements that point to the distinct possibility that genuine long-range antiferromagnetism and superconductivity do not coexist.

These include plutonium and minor actinides such as americium and curium. In preparation for geological disposal there is consensus(2) that actinides that have been separated from spent nuclear fuel should be immobilized within mineral-based ceramics rather than glass(2-4) because of their superior aqueous durability and lower risk of accidental criticality. However, in the long term, the alpha-decay taking place in these ceramics will severely disrupt their crystalline structure(2-4) and reduce their durability(5,6). A fundamental property in predicting cumulative radiation damage is the number of atoms permanently displaced per alpha-decay. At present, this number is estimated to be 1,000 - 2,000 atoms/alpha in zircon(4). Here we report nuclear magnetic resonance, spin-counting experiments that measure close to 5,000 atoms/alpha in radiation-damaged natural zircons. New radiological nuclear magnetic resonance measurements on highly radioactive, Pu-239 zircon show damage similar to that caused by U-238 and Th-232 in mineral zircons at the same dose, indicating no significant effect of half-life or loading levels ( dose rate). On the basis of these measurements, the initially crystalline structure of a 10 weight per cent Pu-239 zircon would be amorphous after only 1,400 years in a geological repository ( desired immobilization timescales are of the order of 250,000 years). These measurements establish a basis for assessing the long-term structural durability of actinide-containing ceramics in terms of an atomistic understanding of the fundamental damage event.","Univ Cambridge, Dept Earth Sci, Cambridge CB2 3EQ, England; Pacific NW Natl Lab, Richland, WA 99352 USA","Farnan, I (reprint author), Univ Cambridge, Dept Earth Sci, Cambridge CB2 3EQ, England.",ifarnan@esc.cam.ac.uk,"Weber, William/A-4177-2008; Farnan, Ian/M-3881-2014","Weber, William/0000-0002-9017-7365; Farnan, Ian/0000-0001-7844-5112",,,,30,92,93,6,86,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,11-Jan,2007,445,7124,,,,,190,193,,10.1038/nature05425,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,124QF,WOS:000243384300047,17215840,No,,,11/20/17

In particular, the redox state of volcanic gases emanating at the Earth's surface is widely believed to mirror that of the magma source, and is thought to have exerted a first-order control on the secular evolution of atmospheric oxygen(6,7). Oxygen fugacity (f(O2)) estimated from lava or related gas chemistry, however, may vary by as much as one log unit(8-10), and the reason for such differences remains obscure. Here we use a coupled chemical - physical model of conduit flow to show that the redox state evolution of an ascending magma, and thus of its coexisting gas phase, is strongly dependent on both the composition and the amount of gas in the reservoir. Magmas with no sulphur show a systematic f(O2) increase during ascent, by as much as 2 log units. Magmas with sulphur show also a change of redox state during ascent, but the direction of change depends on the initial f(O2) in the reservoir. Our calculations closely reproduce the H2S/SO2 ratios of volcanic gases observed at convergent settings, yet the difference between f(O2) in the reservoir and that at the exit of the volcanic conduit may be as much as 1.5 log units. Thus, the redox state of erupted magmas is not necessarily a good proxy of the redox state of the gases they emit. Our findings may require re-evaluation of models aimed at quantifying the role of magmatic volatiles in geological processes.","Univ Orleans, CNRS, UMR 6113, ISTO, F-45071 Orleans 2, France","Burgisser, A (reprint author), Univ Orleans, CNRS, UMR 6113, ISTO, 1a Rue Ferollerie, F-45071 Orleans 2, France.",burgisse@cnrs-orleans.fr,"Scaillet, Bruno/A-5846-2012",,,,,29,107,107,1,42,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,11-Jan,2007,445,7124,,,,,194,197,,10.1038/nature05509,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,124QF,WOS:000243384300048,17215841,No,,,11/20/17

However, it is less clear how habitat modification affects interactions among species(2). Networks of feeding interactions ( food webs) describe the underlying structure of ecological communities, and might be crucially linked to their stability and function(3-7). Here, we analyse 48 quantitative food webs(8,9) for cavity-nesting bees, wasps and their parasitoids across five tropical habitat types. We found marked changes in food-web structure(10,11) across the modification gradient, despite little variation in species richness. The evenness of interaction frequencies declined with habitat modification, with most energy flowing along one or a few pathways in intensively managed agricultural habitats. In modified habitats there was a higher ratio of parasitoid to host species and increased parasitism rates, with implications for the important ecosystem services, such as pollination and biological control, that are performed by host bees and wasps(12). The most abundant parasitoid species was more specialized in modified habitats, with reduced attack rates on alternative hosts. Conventional community descriptors failed to discriminate adequately among habitats, indicating that perturbation of the structure and function of ecological communities might be overlooked in studies that do not document and quantify species interactions. Altered interaction structure therefore represents an insidious and functionally important hidden effect of habitat modification by humans.","Univ Gottingen, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany; Univ Oxford, Dept Zool, Oxford OX1 3PS, England","Tylianakis, JM (reprint author), Univ Canterbury, Sch Biol Sci, Private Bag 4800, Christchurch 8020, New Zealand.",jason.tylianakis@canterbury.ac.nz,"Tylianakis, Jason/B-6634-2011; Tscharntke, Teja/N-5123-2014","Tylianakis, Jason/0000-0001-7402-5620; Lewis, Owen/0000-0001-7935-6111",,,,30,374,385,27,307,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,11-Jan,2007,445,7124,,,,,202,205,,10.1038/nature05429,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,124QF,WOS:000243384300050,17215842,No,Y,N,11/20/17

The cell bodies of sensory neurons that detect such stimuli are located in the dorsal root ganglia, and subtypes of these neurons are specialized to detect specific modalities of mechanical stimuli. Molecules have been identified that are necessary for mechanosensation in invertebrates but so far not in mammals. In Caenorhabditis elegans, mec-2 is one of several genes identified in a screen for touch insensitivity and encodes an integral membrane protein with a stomatin homology domain(1). Here we show that about 35% of skin mechanoreceptors do not respond to mechanical stimuli in mice with a mutation in stomatin-like protein 3 (SLP3, also called Stoml3), a mammalian mec-2 homologue that is expressed in sensory neurons. In addition, mechanosensitive ion channels found in many sensory neurons do not function without SLP3. Tactile-driven behaviours are also impaired in SLP3 mutant mice, including touch-evoked pain caused by neuropathic injury. SLP3 is therefore indispensable for the function of a subset of cutaneous mechanoreceptors, and our data support the idea that this protein is an essential subunit of a mammalian mechanotransducer.","Max Delbruck Ctr Mol Med, Dept Neurosci, D-13125 Berlin, Germany; Charite Univ Med Berlin, D-13125 Berlin, Germany; Univ Hamburg, Zentrum Mol Neurobiol, D-20251 Hamburg, Germany; Charite Univ Med Berlin, Klin Anaesthesiol & Operat Med, D-12200 Berlin, Germany","Lewin, GR (reprint author), Max Delbruck Ctr Mol Med, Dept Neurosci, Robert Rossle Str 10, D-13125 Berlin, Germany.",glewin@mdc-berlin.de,"Riethmacher, Dieter/A-6242-2010; Hu, Jing/G-2092-2011","Machelska, Halina/0000-0001-6315-2958; moshourab, rabih/0000-0002-9180-8472; Lewin, Gary/0000-0002-2890-6352",,,,29,122,126,0,15,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,11-Jan,2007,445,7124,,,,,206,209,,10.1038/nature05394,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,124QF,WOS:000243384300051,17167420,No,,,11/20/17

Their discovery within genomic material from uncultivated marine bacterioplankton caused considerable excitement because it indicated a potential phototrophic function within these organisms, which had previously been considered strictly chemotrophic(1). Subsequent studies established that sequences encoding proteorhodopsin are broadly distributed throughout the world's oceans(2-5). Nevertheless, the role of proteorhodopsins in native marine bacteria is still unknown(6). Here we show, from an analysis of the complete genomes of three marine Flavobacteria, that cultivated bacteria in the phylum Bacteroidetes, one of the principal components of marine bacterioplankton, contain proteorhodopsin. Moreover, growth experiments in both natural and artificial seawater ( low in labile organic matter, which is typical of the world's oceans) establish that exposure to light results in a marked increase in the cell yield of one such bacterium (Dokdonia sp. strain MED134) when compared with cells grown in darkness. Thus, our results show that the phototrophy conferred by proteorhodopsin can provide critical amounts of energy, not only for respiration and maintenance but also for active growth of marine bacterioplankton in their natural environment.","Univ Kalmar, Dept Biol & Environm Sci, SE-39182 KAlmar, Sweden; Univ La Laguna, Dept Microbiol & Cell Biol, ES-38206 Tenerife, Spain; CSIC, CMIMA, Inst Ciencies Mar, ES-08003 Barcelona, Spain; Chalmers, Dept Biol & Chem Engn, SE-41296 Gothenburg, Sweden; Lund Univ, Kemictr, SE-22100 Lund, Sweden; Univ Gothenburg, Dept Chem Biochem & Biophys, SE-40530 Gothenburg, Sweden","Pinhassi, J (reprint author), Univ Kalmar, Dept Biol & Environm Sci, SE-39182 KAlmar, Sweden.",jarone.pinhassi@hik.se,"Neutze, Richard/A-7573-2010; Gonzalez, Jose/C-3333-2013; Gourdon, Pontus/E-1076-2014; Pedros-Alio, Carlos/H-1222-2011","Neutze, Richard/0000-0003-0986-6153; Gonzalez, Jose/0000-0002-9926-3323; Gourdon, Pontus/0000-0002-8631-3539; Pedros-Alio, Carlos/0000-0003-1009-4277",,,,26,192,200,1,56,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,11-Jan,2007,445,7124,,,,,210,213,,10.1038/nature05381,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,124QF,WOS:000243384300052,17215843,No,,,11/20/17

However, recent findings show that cells in the mouse embryo can differ in their developmental fate and potency as early as the four-cell stage(1-4). These differences depend on the orientation and order of the cleavage divisions that generated them(2,5). Because epigenetic marks are suggested to be involved in sustaining pluripotency(6,7), we considered that such developmental properties might be achieved through epigenetic mechanisms. Here we show that modification of histone H3, through the methylation of specific arginine residues, is correlated with cell fate and potency. Levels of H3 methylation at specific arginine residues are maximal in four-cell blastomeres that will contribute to the inner cell mass (ICM) and polar trophectoderm and undertake full development when combined together in chimaeras. Arginine methylation of H3 is minimal in cells whose progeny contributes more to the mural trophectoderm and that show compromised development when combined in chimaeras. This suggests that higher levels of H3 arginine methylation predispose blastomeres to contribute to the pluripotent cells of the ICM. We confirm this prediction by overexpressing the H3-specific arginine methyltransferase CARM1 in individual blastomeres and show that this directs their progeny to the ICM and results in a dramatic upregulation of Nanog and Sox2. Thus, our results identify specific histone modifications as the earliest known epigenetic marker contributing to development of ICM and show that manipulation of epigenetic information influences cell fate determination.","Univ Cambridge, Wellcome Trust Canc Res UK Gurdon Inst, Cambridge CB2 1QN, England","Zernicka-Goetz, M (reprint author), Univ Cambridge, Wellcome Trust Canc Res UK Gurdon Inst, Tennis Court Rd, Cambridge CB2 1QN, England.",mzg@mole.bio.cam.ac.uk,,,"Medical Research Council [G0300723, G0800784]; Wellcome Trust [, 064421]",,,25,314,333,1,26,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,11-Jan,2007,445,7124,,,,,214,218,,10.1038/nature05458,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,124QF,WOS:000243384300053,17215844,No,,,11/20/17

On feeding, glucose influx triggers gene expression changes in hepatocytes to suppress endogenous glucose production and convert excess glucose into glycogen or fatty acids to be stored in adipose tissue(2). This process is controlled by insulin, although debate exists as to whether insulin acts directly or indirectly on the liver(3). In addition to stimulating pancreatic insulin release, glucose also regulates the activity of ChREBP, a transcription factor that modulates lipogenesis(4). Here we describe another mechanism whereby glucose determines its own fate: we show that glucose binds and stimulates the transcriptional activity of the liver X receptor (LXR), a nuclear receptor that coordinates hepatic lipid metabolism. D-Glucose and D-glucose-6-phosphate are direct agonists of both LXR-alpha and LXR-beta. Glucose activates LXR at physiological concentrations expected in the liver and induces expression of LXR target genes with efficacy similar to that of oxysterols, the known LXR ligands. Cholesterol homeostasis genes that require LXR for expression are upregulated in liver and intestine of fasted mice re-fed with a glucose diet, indicating that glucose is an endogenous LXR ligand.

In the traditional picture, this fast rotation is the result of conservation of angular momentum during the collapse of a rotating stellar core. This leads to the inevitable conclusion that pulsar spin is directly correlated with the rotation of the progenitor star(2). So far, however, stellar theory has not been able to explain the distribution of pulsar spins, suggesting that the birth rotation is either too slow(3) or too fast(2,4). Here we report a robust instability of the stalled accretion shock in core-collapse supernovae that is able to generate a strong rotational flow in the vicinity of the accreting proto-neutron star. Sufficient angular momentum is deposited on the proto-neutron star to generate a final spin period consistent with observations, even beginning with spherically symmetrical initial conditions.

Initial visible(3) and radar(4,5) imaging failed to find any evidence of an ocean, although abundant evidence was found that flowing liquids have existed on the surface(5,6). Here we provide definitive evidence for the presence of lakes on the surface of Titan, obtained during the Cassini Radar flyby of Titan on 22 July 2006 (T-16). The radar imaging polewards of 70 degrees north shows more than 75 circular to irregular radar-dark patches, in a region where liquid methane and ethane are expected to be abundant and stable on the surface(2,7). The radar-dark patches are interpreted as lakes on the basis of their very low radar reflectivity and morphological similarities to lakes, including associated channels and location in topographic depressions. Some of the lakes do not completely fill the depressions in which they lie, and apparently dry depressions are present. We interpret this to indicate that lakes are present in a number of states, including partly dry and liquid-filled. These northern-hemisphere lakes constitute the strongest evidence yet that a condensable-liquid hydrological cycle is active in Titan's surface and atmosphere, in which the lakes are filled through rainfall and/or intersection with the subsurface 'liquid methane' table.","Proxemy Res, Rectortown, VA 20140 USA; UCL, Dept Earth Sci, London WC1E 6BT, England; CALTECH, Jet Prop Lab, Pasadena, CA 91109 USA; Univ Arizona, Lunar & Planetary Lab, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA; Johns Hopkins Univ, Appl Phys Lab, Space Dept, Laurel, MD 20723 USA; US Geol Survey, Flagstaff, AZ 86001 USA; Wheeling Jesuit Univ, Tucson, AZ 85719 USA; Planetary Sci Inst, Tucson, AZ 85719 USA; Stanford Univ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; NASA, Goddard Inst Space Studies, New York, NY 10025 USA; Observ Paris, F-92195 Meudon, France; Alenia Aerospazio, I-00131 Rome, Italy; Fac Ingn, I-80125 Naples, Italy; CALTECH, Div Geol & Planetary Sci, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA; Observ Aquitain Sci Univers UMR 5804, F-33270 Floirac, France; Univ Roma La Sapienza, I-00184 Rome, Italy; Politecn Bari, Dipartimento Interateneo Fis, I-70126 Bari, Italy","Stofan, ER (reprint author), Proxemy Res, Rectortown, VA 20140 USA.",estofan@proxemy.com,"Lorenz, Ralph/B-8759-2016; Lopes, Rosaly/D-1608-2016","Lorenz, Ralph/0000-0001-8528-4644; Lopes, Rosaly/0000-0002-7928-3167",,,,27,293,300,13,69,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,4-Jan,2007,445,7123,,,,,61,64,,10.1038/nature05438,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,122KG,WOS:000243225100035,17203056,No,Y,N,11/20/17

However, the absence of any significant photon - photon interaction is problematic for the realization of non-trivial two-qubit gates. One solution is to introduce an effective nonlinearity by measurements resulting in probabilistic gate operations(2,3). In one-way quantum computation(4-8), the random quantum measurement error can be overcome by applying a feed-forward technique, such that the future measurement basis depends on earlier measurement results. This technique is crucial for achieving deterministic quantum computation once a cluster state ( the highly entangled multiparticle state on which one-way quantum computation is based) is prepared. Here we realize a concatenated scheme of measurement and active feed-forward in a one-way quantum computing experiment. We demonstrate that, for a perfect cluster state and no photon loss, our quantum computation scheme would operate with good fidelity and that our feed-forward components function with very high speed and low error for detected photons. With present technology, the individual computational step ( in our case the individual feed-forward cycle) can be operated in less than 150 ns using electro-optical modulators. This is an important result for the future development of one-way quantum computers, whose large-scale implementation will depend on advances in the production and detection of the required highly entangled cluster states.","Univ Vienna, Inst Expt Phys, A-1090 Vienna, Austria; Harvard Univ, Dept Phys, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; Austrian Acad Sci, Inst Quantum Opt & Quantum Informat, A-1090 Vienna, Austria","Prevedel, R (reprint author), Univ Vienna, Inst Expt Phys, Boltzmanngasse 5, A-1090 Vienna, Austria.",robert.prevedel@univie.ac.at; zeilinger-office@quantum.at,"Prevedel, Robert/L-3377-2014; Kaltenbaek, Rainer/C-8141-2015","Prevedel, Robert/0000-0003-3366-4703; Kaltenbaek, Rainer/0000-0002-9991-9919; Walther, Philip/0000-0002-4964-817X",,,,30,193,197,4,36,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,4-Jan,2007,445,7123,,,,,65,69,,10.1038/nature05346,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,122KG,WOS:000243225100036,17203057,No,Y,N,11/20/17

Application of the physics of granular materials has increased the understanding of avalanches(2), geological faults 3,4, flow in hoppers and silos 5, and soil mechanics(6,7). During the equiaxed solidification of metallic alloys, there exists a range of solid fractions where the microstructure consists of a geometrically crowded disordered assembly of crystals saturated with liquid. It is therefore natural to ask if such a microstructure deforms as a granular material and what relevance this might have to solidification processing. Here we show that partially solidified alloys can exhibit the characteristics of a cohesionless granular material, including Reynolds' dilatancy(1) and strain localization in dilatant shear bands 7 - 18 mean crystals wide. We show that this behaviour is important in defect formation during high pressure die casting of Al and Mg alloys, a global industry that contributes over $7.3 billion to the USA's economy alone(8) and is used in the manufacture of products that include mobile-phone covers and steering wheels. More broadly, these findings highlight the potential to apply the principles and modelling approaches developed in granular mechanics to the field of solidification processing, and also indicate the possible benefits that might be gained from exploring and exploiting further synergies between these fields.","Univ Queensland, CAST CRC, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia; Univ Queensland, Australian Res Council CoE Design Light Met Mat E, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia","Gourlay, CM (reprint author), Univ Queensland, CAST CRC, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia.",c.gourlay@minmet.uq.edu.au; a.dahle@minmet.uq.edu.au,"Gourlay, Christopher/D-9584-2011","Gourlay, Christopher/0000-0002-4588-6007",,,,30,95,97,4,65,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,4-Jan,2007,445,7123,,,,,70,73,,10.1038/nature05426,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,122KG,WOS:000243225100037,17203058,No,,,11/20/17

The past strength of the rain-bearing East Asian summer monsoon can be reconstructed with archives such as cave deposits(1-3), but the winter monsoon has no such signature in the hydrological cycle and has thus proved difficult to reconstruct. Here we present high-resolution records of the magnetic properties and the titanium content of the sediments of Lake Huguang Maar in coastal southeast China over the past 16,000 years, which we use as proxies for the strength of the winter monsoon winds. We find evidence for stronger winter monsoon winds before the Bolling - Allerod warming, during the Younger Dryas episode and during the middle and late Holocene, when cave stalagmites suggest weaker summer monsoons(1-3). We conclude that this anticorrelation is best explained by migrations in the intertropical convergence zone. Similar migrations of the intertropical convergence zone have been observed in Central America for the period AD 700 to 900 (refs 4 - 6), suggesting global climatic changes at that time. From the coincidence in timing, we suggest that these migrations in the tropical rain belt could have contributed to the declines of both the Tang dynasty in China and the Classic Maya in Central America.","Geoforschungszentrum Potsdam, Sect 3 3, D-14473 Potsdam, Germany; Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geol & Geophys, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China; Princeton Univ, Dept Geosci, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; Univ Miami, Rosenstiel Sch Marine & Atmospher Sci, Miami, FL 33149 USA","Haug, GH (reprint author), Geoforschungszentrum Potsdam, Sect 3 3, D-14473 Potsdam, Germany.",haug@gfz-potsdam.de,"Sigman, Daniel/A-2649-2008","Sigman, Daniel/0000-0002-7923-1973",,,,30,382,485,15,183,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,4-Jan,2007,445,7123,,,,,74,77,,10.1038/nature05431,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,122KG,WOS:000243225100038,17203059,No,Y,N,11/20/17

Links between gross tooth shape, function and diet have been proposed since antiquity, stretching from Aristotle(1) to Cuvier(2), Owen(3) and Osborn(4). So far, however, the possibilities for exhaustive, quantitative comparisons between greatly different tooth shapes have been limited. Cat teeth and mouse teeth, for example, are fundamentally distinct in shape and structure as a result of independent evolutionary change over tens of millions of years(5). There is difficulty in establishing homology between their tooth components or in summarizing their tooth shapes, yet both carnivorans and rodents possess a comparable spectrum of dietary specializations from animals to plants. Here we introduce homology-free techniques(6-8) to measure the phenotypic complexity of the three-dimensional shape of tooth crowns. In our geographic information systems (GIS) analysis of 441 teeth from 81 species of carnivorans and rodents, we show that the surface complexity of tooth crowns directly reflects the foods they consume. Moreover, the absolute values of dental complexity for individual dietary classes correspond between carnivorans and rodents, illustrating a high-level similarity between overall tooth shapes despite a lack of low-level similarity of specific tooth components. These results suggest that scale-independent forces have determined the high-level dental shape in lineages that are widely divergent in size, ecology and life history. This link between diet and phenotype will be useful for inferring the ecology of extinct species and illustrates the potential of fast-throughput, high-level analysis of the phenotype.","Inst Biotechnol, Evolut & Dev Unit, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland; Denver Museum Nat & Sci, Dept Earth Sci, Denver, CO 80205 USA; Univ Helsinki, Dept Geol, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland","Evans, AR (reprint author), Inst Biotechnol, Evolut & Dev Unit, POB 56 Viikinkaari 9, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland.",arevans@fastmail.fm,"Wilson, Gregory/A-2363-2009; Evans, Alistair/D-4239-2011","Evans, Alistair/0000-0002-4078-4693; Fortelius, Mikael/0000-0002-4851-783X",,,,30,162,165,6,55,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,4-Jan,2007,445,7123,,,,,78,81,,10.1038/nature05433,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,122KG,WOS:000243225100039,17167416,No,Y,N,11/20/17

For example, the divergence between taxa at neutrally evolving sites in the genome is proportional to the per nucleotide mutation rate, u (ref. 1), and this can be used to date speciation events by assuming a molecular clock. The overall rate of occurrence of deleterious mutations in the genome each generation (U) appears in theories of nucleotide divergence and polymorphism(2), the evolution of sex and recombination(3), and the evolutionary consequences of inbreeding(2). However, estimates of U based on changes in allozymes(4) or DNA sequences(5) and fitness traits are discordant(6-8). Here we directly estimate u in Drosophila melanogaster by scanning 20 million bases of DNA from three sets of mutation accumulation lines by using denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography(9). From 37 mutation events that we detected, we obtained a mean estimate for u of 8.4 x 10(-9) per generation. Moreover, we detected significant heterogeneity in u among the three mutation-accumulation-line genotypes. By multiplying u by an estimate of the fraction of mutations that are deleterious in natural populations of Drosophila(10), we estimate that U is 1.2 per diploid genome. This high rate suggests that selection against deleterious mutations may have a key role in explaining patterns of genetic variation in the genome, and help to maintain recombination and sexual reproduction.","Univ Edinburgh, Sch Biol Sci, Inst Evolutionary Biol, Edinburgh EH9 3JT, Midlothian, Scotland","Keightley, PD (reprint author), Univ Edinburgh, Sch Biol Sci, Inst Evolutionary Biol, W Mains Rd, Edinburgh EH9 3JT, Midlothian, Scotland.",keightley.drosmutrate@spambob.net,"Halligan, Daniel/H-4459-2011",,Wellcome Trust,,,30,225,227,0,51,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,4-Jan,2007,445,7123,,,,,82,85,,10.1038/nature05388,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,122KG,WOS:000243225100040,17203060,No,,,11/20/17

This is accomplished by detecting and following plumes of volatile host emissions, which include carbon dioxide (CO2)(1). CO2 is sensed by a population of olfactory sensory neurons in the maxillary palps of mosquitoes(2,3) and in the antennae of the more genetically tractable fruitfly, Drosophila melanogaster(4). The molecular identity of the chemosensory CO2 receptor, however, remains unknown. Here we report that CO2-responsive neurons in Drosophila co-express a pair of chemosensory receptors, Gr21a and Gr63a, at both larval and adult life stages. We identify mosquito homologues of Gr21a and Gr63a, GPRGR22 and GPRGR24, and show that these are co-expressed in A. gambiae maxillary palps. We show that Gr21a and Gr63a together are sufficient for olfactory CO2-chemosensation in Drosophila. Ectopic expression of Gr21a and Gr63a together confers CO2 sensitivity on CO2-insensitive olfactory neurons, but neither gustatory receptor alone has this function. Mutant flies lacking Gr63a lose both electrophysiological and behavioural responses to CO2. Knowledge of the molecular identity of the insect olfactory CO2 receptors may spur the development of novel mosquito control strategies designed to take advantage of this unique and critical olfactory pathway. This in turn could bolster the worldwide fight against malaria and other insect-borne diseases.","Rockefeller Univ, Lab Neurogenet & Behav, New York, NY 10021 USA; Univ Calif Los Angeles, David Geffen Sch Med, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Dept Biol Chem, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA","Vosshall, LB (reprint author), Rockefeller Univ, Lab Neurogenet & Behav, 1230 York Ave, New York, NY 10021 USA.",leslie@mail.rockefeller.edu,"Jones, Walton/A-2417-2011","Jones, Walton/0000-0001-8642-627X; Grunwald Kadow, Ilona/0000-0002-9085-4274; Vosshall, Leslie/0000-0002-6060-8099",,,,29,302,318,3,69,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,4-Jan,2007,445,7123,,,,,86,90,,10.1038/nature05466,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,122KG,WOS:000243225100041,17167414,No,,,11/20/17

During phagocytosis, particles are internalized into 'phagosomes', organelles from which immune processes such as microbial destruction and antigen presentation are initiated(3). Certain pathogens have evolved mechanisms to evade the immune system and persist undetected within phagocytes, and it is therefore evident that a detailed knowledge of this process is essential to an understanding of many aspects of innate and adaptive immunity. However, despite the crucial role of phagosomes in immunity, their components and organization are not fully defined. Here we present a systems biology analysis of phagosomes isolated from cells derived from the genetically tractable model organism Drosophila melanogaster and address the complex dynamic interactions between proteins within this organelle and their involvement in particle engulfment. Proteomic analysis identified 617 proteins potentially associated with Drosophila phagosomes; these were organized by protein - protein interactions to generate the 'phagosome interactome', a detailed protein - protein interaction network of this subcellular compartment. These networks predicted both the architecture of the phagosome and putative biomodules. The contribution of each protein and complex to bacterial internalization was tested by RNA-mediated interference and identified known components of the phagocytic machinery. In addition, the prediction and validation of regulators of phagocytosis such as the 'exocyst'(4), a macromolecular complex required for exocytosis but not previously implicated in phagocytosis, validates this strategy. In generating this 'systems-based model', we show the power of applying this approach to the study of complex cellular processes and organelles and expect that this detailed model of the phagosome will provide a new framework for studying host pathogen interactions and innate immunity.","Harvard Univ, Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Sch Med, Lab Dev Immunol, Boston, MA 02114 USA; Univ Edinburgh, Queens Med Res Inst, MRC, Ctr Inflammat Res, Edinburgh EH16 4TJ, Midlothian, Scotland; Univ Montreal, Dept Pathol & Biol Cellulaire, Montreal, PQ H3C 3J7, Canada; Johns Hopkins Univ, Dept Biomed Engn & High Throughput Biol Ctr, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA; McGill Univ, Fac Med, Dept Biomed Engn, Montreal, PQ H3A 2B4, Canada","Stuart, LM (reprint author), Harvard Univ, Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Sch Med, Lab Dev Immunol, 55 Fruit St, Boston, MA 02114 USA.",lstuart@partners.org,"Bader, Joel/A-1818-2009; Charriere, Guillaume/O-8317-2014","Bader, Joel/0000-0002-6020-4625; Charriere, Guillaume/0000-0002-4796-1488; Huang, Hailiang/0000-0003-1461-5762",Wellcome Trust,,,29,148,153,0,18,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,4-Jan,2007,445,7123,,,,,95,101,,10.1038/nature05380,,7,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,122KG,WOS:000243225100043,17151602,No,,,11/20/17

The transcription factor GATA-1, which performs an essential function in erythroid differentiation(1,2) by positively regulating promoters of erythroid and anti-apoptotic genes(3-6), is cleaved by caspases in erythroid precursors undergoing cell death upon erythropoietin starvation or engagement of the death receptor Fas(7,8). In contrast, by an unknown mechanism, GATA-1 remains uncleaved when these cells undergo terminal differentiation upon stimulation with Epo(9-11). Here we show that during differentiation, but not during apoptosis, the chaperone protein Hsp70 protects GATA-1 fromcaspase-mediated proteolysis. At the onset of caspase activation, Hsp70 co-localizes and interacts with GATA-1 in the nucleus of erythroid precursors undergoing terminal differentiation. In contrast, erythropoietin starvation induces the nuclear export of Hsp70 and the cleavage of GATA-1. In an in vitro assay, Hsp70 protects GATA-1 from caspase-3-mediated proteolysis through its peptide-binding domain. The use of RNA-mediated interference to decrease the Hsp70 content of erythroid precursors cultured in the presence of erythropoietin leads to GATA-1 cleavage, a decrease in haemoglobin content, downregulation of the expression of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-X(L), and cell death by apoptosis. These effects are abrogated by the transduction of a caspase-resistant GATA-1 mutant. Thus, in erythroid precursors undergoing terminal differentiation, Hsp70 prevents active caspase-3 from cleaving GATA-1 and inducing apoptosis.","Univ Paris 05, Inst Federat Necker, CNRS,UMR 8147, Fac Med, F-75270 Paris, France; INSERM, UMR 517, F-21079 Dijon, France; Ist Super Sanita, Dept Hematol & Oncol, I-00161 Rome, Italy; Danish Canc Soc, Inst Canc Biol, Dept Apoptosis, DK-2100 Copenhagen, Denmark; Univ Paris 05, Assistance Publ Hop Paris, F-75270 Paris, France; Fac Med, Dept Hematol, F-75270 Paris, France","Hermine, O (reprint author), Univ Paris 05, Inst Federat Necker, CNRS,UMR 8147, Fac Med, F-75270 Paris, France.",zermati@igr.fr; hermine@necker.fr,"Moura, Ivan/A-9510-2013; Ribeil, Jean-Antoine/F-7896-2017","Moura, Ivan/0000-0002-2977-0354; Ribeil, Jean-Antoine/0000-0002-5733-9123; Cruz Moura, Ivan/0000-0002-8418-2803; Hermine, Olivier/0000-0003-2574-3874; Zeuner, Ann/0000-0002-8295-3715",,,,24,133,141,2,13,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,4-Jan,2007,445,7123,,,,,102,105,,10.1038/nature05378,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,122KG,WOS:000243225100044,17167422,No,,,11/20/17

What has yet to be established is whether every colon cancer cell possesses the potential to initiate and sustain tumour growth, or whether the tumour is hierarchically organized so that only a subset of cells - cancer stem cells - possess such potential(6,7). Here we use renal capsule transplantation in immunodeficient NOD/SCID mice to identify a human colon cancer-initiating cell (CC-IC). Purification experiments established that all CC-ICs were CD133(+); the CD133(-) cells that comprised the majority of the tumour were unable to initiate tumour growth. We calculated by limiting dilution analysis that there was one CC-IC in 5.7 x 10(4) unfractionated tumour cells, whereas there was one CC-IC in 262 CD133(+) cells, representing >200-fold enrichment. CC-ICs within the CD133(+) population were able to maintain themselves as well as differentiate and reestablish tumour heterogeneity upon serial transplantation. The identification of colon cancer stem cells that are distinct from the bulk tumour cells provides strong support for the hierarchical organization of human colon cancer, and their existence suggests that for therapeutic strategies to be effective, they must target the cancer stem cells.","Univ Hlth Network, Div Cell & Mol Biol, Toronto, ON M5G 1L7, Canada; Mt Sinai Hosp, Samuel Lunenfeld Res Inst, Ctr Canc Genet, Toronto, ON M5G 1X5, Canada; Univ Toronto, Dept Mol & Med Genet, Toronto, ON M5S 1A8, Canada","Dick, JE (reprint author), Univ Hlth Network, Div Cell & Mol Biol, Toronto, ON M5G 1L7, Canada.",jdick@uhnres.utoronto.ca,"Gallinger, Steven/E-4575-2013; Pollett, Aaron/J-2308-2016","Pollett, Aaron/0000-0001-5121-8788; O'Brien, Catherine/0000-0003-0682-3879",,,,26,2414,2558,25,202,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,4-Jan,2007,445,7123,,,,,106,110,,10.1038/nature05372,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,122KG,WOS:000243225100045,17122772,No,Y,N,11/20/17

The isolation and characterization of tumorigenic colon cancer cells may help to devise novel diagnostic and therapeutic procedures. Although there is increasing evidence that a rare population of undifferentiated cells is responsible for tumour formation and maintenance(2-4), this has not been explored for colorectal cancer. Here, we show that tumorigenic cells in colon cancer are included in the high-density CD133(+) population, which accounts for about 2.5% of the tumour cells. Subcutaneous injection of colon cancer CD133(+) cells readily reproduced the original tumour in immunodeficient mice, whereas CD133(-) cells did not form tumours. Such tumours were serially transplanted for several generations, in each of which we observed progressively faster tumour growth without significant phenotypic alterations. Unlike CD133(-) cells, CD133(+) colon cancer cells grew exponentially for more than one year in vitro as undifferentiated tumour spheres in serum-free medium, maintaining the ability to engraft and reproduce the same morphological and antigenic pattern of the original tumour. We conclude that colorectal cancer is created and propagated by a small number of undifferentiated tumorigenic CD133(+) cells, which should therefore be the target of future therapies.","Ist Super Sanita, Dept Hematol & Oncol, I-00161 Rome, Italy; Mediterranean Inst Oncol, I-95029 Catania, Italy; Univ Roma La Sapienza, Sant Andrea Hosp, Dept Lab Med & Pathol, I-00189 Rome, Italy; Univ Palermo, Dept Surg & Oncol Sci, I-90127 Palermo, Italy","De Maria, R (reprint author), Ist Super Sanita, Dept Hematol & Oncol, Viale Regina Elena 299, I-00161 Rome, Italy.",rdemaria@tin.it,"Ricci Vitiani, Lucia/J-8320-2016; Biffoni, Mauro/J-8318-2016","Ricci Vitiani, Lucia/0000-0001-7336-5615; Biffoni, Mauro/0000-0002-1304-9060",,,,22,2368,2551,15,192,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,4-Jan,2007,445,7123,,,,,111,115,,10.1038/nature05384,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,122KG,WOS:000243225100046,17122771,No,Y,N,11/20/17

Among them, the pentameric or 'Cys-loop' receptors (pLGICs) compose a family that until recently was found in only eukaryotes. Yet a recent genome search identified putative homologues of these proteins in several bacterial species(1). Here we report the cloning, expression and functional identification of one of these putative homologues from the cyanobacterium Gloeobacter violaceus. It was expressed as a homo-oligomer in HEK 293 cells and Xenopus oocytes, generating a transmembrane cationic channel that is opened by extracellular protons and shows slow kinetics of activation, no desensitization and a single channel conductance of 8 pS. Electron microscopy and cross-linking experiments of the protein fused to the maltose-binding protein and expressed in Escherichia coli are consistent with a homo-pentameric organization. Sequence comparison shows that it possesses a compact structure, with the absence of the amino-terminal helix, the canonical disulphide bridge and the large cytoplasmic domain found in eukaryotic pLGICs. Therefore it embodies a minimal structure required for signal transduction. These data establish the prokaryotic origin of the family. Because Gloeobacter violaceus carries out photosynthesis and proton transport at the cytoplasmic membrane(2), this new proton-gated ion channel might contribute to adaptation to pH change.","Inst Pasteur, CNRS, URA D2182, Unit Receptor & Cognit, F-75015 Paris, France; Univ Paris 06 & 7, Inst Jacques Monod, CNRS, UMR 7590, F-75005 Paris, France; Ecole Normale Super, CNRS, UMR 8544, Neurobiol Lab, F-75005 Paris, France","Corringer, PJ (reprint author), Inst Pasteur, CNRS, URA D2182, Unit Receptor & Cognit, F-75015 Paris, France.",pjcorrin@pasteur.fr,"Taly, Antoine/B-3339-2008",,,,,30,198,202,0,16,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,4-Jan,2007,445,7123,,,,,116,119,,10.1038/nature05371,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,122KG,WOS:000243225100047,17167423,No,,,11/20/17

Our results indicate that the obese microbiome has an increased capacity to harvest energy from the diet.

Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is the best-characterized inducer of tumour angiogenesis. We report that VEGF dynamically regulates tumour endothelial expression of Delta-like ligand 4 (Dll4), which was previously shown to be absolutely required for normal embryonic vascular development. To define Dll4 function in tumour angiogenesis, we manipulated this pathway in murine tumour models using several approaches. Here we show that blockade resulted in markedly increased tumour vascularity, associated with enhanced angiogenic sprouting and branching. Paradoxically, this increased vascularity was non-productive - as shown by poor perfusion and increased hypoxia, and most importantly, by decreased tumour growth - even for tumours resistant to anti-VEGF therapy. Thus, VEGF-induced Dll4 acts as a negative regulator of tumour angiogenesis; its blockade results in a striking uncoupling of tumour growth from vessel density, presenting a novel therapeutic approach even for tumours resistant to anti-VEGF therapies.","Regeneron Pharmaceut Inc, Res Labs, Tarrytown, NY 10591 USA","Thurston, G (reprint author), Regeneron Pharmaceut Inc, Res Labs, 777 Old Saw Mill River Rd, Tarrytown, NY 10591 USA.",Gavin.Thurston@Regeneron.com,"Wang, Zegen/H-3018-2011",,,,,35,632,666,4,38,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,21-Dec,2006,444,7122,,,,,1032,1037,,10.1038/nature05355,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,118VH,WOS:000242971100046,17183313,No,,,11/20/17

Mild mutations in XPF cause the cancer-prone syndrome xeroderma pigmentosum. A patient presented with a severe XPF mutation leading to profound crosslink sensitivity and dramatic progeroid symptoms. It is not known how unrepaired DNA damage accelerates ageing or its relevance to natural ageing. Here we show a highly significant correlation between the liver transcriptome of old mice and a mouse model of this progeroid syndrome. Expression data from XPF-ERCC1-deficient mice indicate increased cell death and anti-oxidant defences, a shift towards anabolism and reduced growth hormone/insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) signalling, a known regulator of lifespan. Similar changes are seen in wild-type mice in response to chronic genotoxic stress, caloric restriction, or with ageing. We conclude that unrepaired cytotoxic DNA damage induces a highly conserved metabolic response mediated by the IGF1/insulin pathway, which re-allocates resources from growth to somatic preservation and life extension. This highlights a causal contribution of DNA damage to ageing and demonstrates that ageing and end-of-life fitness are determined both by stochastic damage, which is the cause of functional decline, and genetics, which determines the rates of damage accumulation and decline.","Erasmus Univ, Med Ctr, Ctr Biomed Genet Med Genet Ctr, Dept Cell Biol & Genet, NL-3000 DR Rotterdam, Netherlands; Erasmus Univ, Med Ctr, Dept Expt Radiol, NL-3000 DR Rotterdam, Netherlands; Erasmus Univ, Med Ctr, Dept Clin Genet, NL-3000 DR Rotterdam, Netherlands; Univ Pittsburgh, Sch Med, Inst Canc, Dept Mol Genet & Biochem, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA; Altonaer kinderkrankenhaus, Abt Med Genet, D-22763 Hamburg, Germany; Buck Inst Age Res, Novato, CA 94945 USA","Hoeijmakers, JHJ (reprint author), Erasmus Univ, Med Ctr, Ctr Biomed Genet Med Genet Ctr, Dept Cell Biol & Genet, POB 1738, NL-3000 DR Rotterdam, Netherlands.",j.hoeijmakers@erasmusmc.nl,"van der Horst, Gijsbertus/E-3661-2015","van der Horst, Gijsbertus/0000-0002-7773-6396; Garinis, George/0000-0002-3200-5004",NCI NIH HHS [K22 CA111525],,,49,378,385,4,26,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,21-Dec,2006,444,7122,,,,,1038,1043,,10.1038/nature05456,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,118VH,WOS:000242971100047,17183314,No,,,11/20/17

Long-duration bursts originate from star-forming regions in galaxies(2), have accompanying supernovae when these are near enough to observe and are probably caused by massive-star collapsars(3). Recent observations(4-10) show that short-duration bursts originate in regions within their host galaxies that have lower star-formation rates, consistent with binary neutron star or neutron star - black hole mergers(11,12). Moreover, although their hosts are predominantly nearby galaxies, no supernovae have been so far associated with short-duration GRBs. Here we report that the bright, nearby GRB 060614 does not fit into either class. Its similar to 102-s duration groups it with long-duration GRBs, while its temporal lag and peak luminosity fall entirely within the short-duration GRB subclass. Moreover, very deep optical observations exclude an accompanying supernova(13-15), similar to short-duration GRBs. This combination of a long-duration event without an accompanying supernova poses a challenge to both the collapsar and the merging-neutron-star interpretations and opens the door to a new GRB classification scheme that straddles both long- and short-duration bursts.","NASA, Goddard Space Flight Ctr, Greenbelt, MD 20771 USA; Stanford Univ, KIPAC, Stanford, CA 94309 USA; NASA, George C Marshall Space Flight Ctr, NSSTC, Huntsville, AL 35805 USA; NSSTC, USRA, Huntsville, AL 35805 USA; Univ Maryland, Dept Astron, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; Penn State Univ, Dept Phys, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; CALTECH, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA; Univ Leicester, Dept Phys & Astron, Leicester LE1 7RH, Leics, England; UCL, Mullard Space Sci Lab, Dorking RH5 6NT, Surrey, England; Los Alamos Natl Lab, Los Alamos, NM 87545 USA; Oak Ridge Associated Univ, Oak Ridge, TN 37831 USA; Univ Virginia, Dept Astron, Charlottesville, VA 22904 USA; Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Astron & Astrophys, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA","Gehrels, N (reprint author), NASA, Goddard Space Flight Ctr, Greenbelt, MD 20771 USA.",gehrels@milkyway.gsfc.nasa.gov,"Barthelmy, Scott/D-2943-2012; Gehrels, Neil/D-2971-2012; Parsons, Ann/I-6604-2012",,,,,27,308,313,0,7,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,21-Dec,2006,444,7122,,,,,1044,1046,,10.1038/nature05376,,3,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,118VH,WOS:000242971100048,17183315,No,,,11/20/17

The standard 'collapsar' model(3) predicts that a broad-lined and luminous type Ic core-collapse supernova accompanies every long- duration GRB(4). This association has been confirmed in observations of several nearby GRBs(5-9). Here we report that GRB 060505 ( ref. 10) and GRB 060614 ( ref. 11) were not accompanied by supernova emission down to limits hundreds of times fainter than the archetypal supernova SN 1998bw that accompanied GRB 980425, and fainter than any type Ic supernova ever observed(12). Multi-band observations of the early afterglows, as well as spectroscopy of the host galaxies, exclude the possibility of significant dust obscuration and show that the bursts originated in actively star-forming regions. The absence of a supernova to such deep limits is qualitatively different from all previous nearby long- duration GRBs and suggests a new phenomenological type of massive stellar death.","Univ Copenhagen, Dark Cosmol Ctr, DK-2100 Copenhagen, Denmark; Univ Copenhagen, Niels Bohr Inst, DK-2100 Copenhagen, Denmark; Univ Stockholm, AlbaNova, Dept Astron, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden; Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Astron, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; Univ Hertfordshire, Ctr Astrophys Res, Hatfield AL10 9AB, Herts, England; Space Telescope Sci Inst, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA; Liverpool John Moores Univ, Astrophys Res Inst, Birkenhead CH41 1LD, Merseyside, England; Univ Hawaii, Inst Astron, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; Univ Heidelberg ZAH, Zentrum AStron, ARI, D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany; Univ Coll Dublin, Sch Phys, Dublin 4, Ireland; CSIC, Inst Astrofis Andalucia, E-18080 Granada, Spain; Univ St Andrews, SUPA Phys Astron, St Andrews KY16 9SS, Fife, Scotland; Thuringer Landessternwarte Tautenburg, D-07778 Tautenburg, Germany; Univ Paris 06, CNRS, UMR 70951, Inst Astrophys Paris, F-75014 Paris, France; Inst Adv Study, Princeton, NJ 08540 USA; Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Astron & Astrophys, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA; Univ Chile, Dept Astron, Santiago, Chile; Univ Amsterdam, Astron Inst Anton Pannekoek, Fac Sci, NL-1098 SJ Amsterdam, Netherlands","Fynbo, JPU (reprint author), Univ Copenhagen, Dark Cosmol Ctr, Juliane Maries Vej 30, DK-2100 Copenhagen, Denmark.",jfynbo@dark-cosmology.dk,"; Fynbo, Johan/L-8496-2014; Hjorth, Jens/M-5787-2014; Watson, Darach/E-4521-2015; Jensen, Brian Lindgren/E-1275-2015; Jakobsson, Pall/L-9950-2015; Davis, Tamara/A-4280-2008","Wijers, Ralph/0000-0002-3101-1808; Bloom, Joshua/0000-0002-7777-216X; Thone, Christina/0000-0002-7978-7648; Fynbo, Johan/0000-0002-8149-8298; Hjorth, Jens/0000-0002-4571-2306; Watson, Darach/0000-0002-4465-8264; Jensen, Brian Lindgren/0000-0002-0906-9771; Jakobsson, Pall/0000-0002-9404-5650; Davis, Tamara/0000-0002-4213-8783",,,,27,278,283,0,9,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,21-Dec,2006,444,7122,,,,,1047,1049,,10.1038/nature05375,,3,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,118VH,WOS:000242971100049,17183316,No,,,11/20/17

Long-duration GRBs ( those lasting more than similar to 2 s) are believed to originate from the deaths of massive stars 1, mainly on the basis of a handful of solid associations between GRBs and supernovae(2-7). GRB 060614, one of the closest GRBs discovered, consisted of a 5-s hard spike followed by softer, brighter emission that lasted for similar to 100 s (refs 8, 9). Here we report deep optical observations of GRB 060614 showing no emerging supernova with absolute visual magnitude brighter than M(V) = -13.7. Any supernova associated with GRB 060614 was therefore at least 100 times fainter, at optical wavelengths, than the other supernovae associated with GRBs(10). This demonstrates that some long-lasting GRBs can either be associated with a very faint supernova or produced by different phenomena.","Osserv Astrofis Arcetri, INAF, I-50125 Florence, Italy; Univ Milano Bicocca, Dipartimento Fis, I-20126 Milan, Italy; Osserv Astron Brera, INAF, I-23807 Merate, Lc, Italy; Space Telescope Sci Inst, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA; Ist Nazl Astrofis, I-00136 Rome, Italy; Supernova Ltd, Virgin Gorda, VI USA; SISSA, ISAS, I-34014 Trieste, Italy; Osserv Astron Roma, INAF, I-00040 Rome, Italy; Ist Astrofis Spaziale & Fis Cosm, INAF, I-90146 Palermo, Italy; ASI Sci Data Ctr, I-00044 Frascati, Italy; Univ Insubria, Dipartimento Matemat & Fis, I-22100 Como, Italy; Univ Calif Berkeley, Space Sci Lab, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; European So Observ, Santiago 19, Chile; Univ Buenos Aires, CONICET, Inst Astron & Fis Espacio, RA-1428 Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina","Della Valle, M (reprint author), Osserv Astrofis Arcetri, INAF, Largo E Fermi 5, I-50125 Florence, Italy.",massimo@arcetri.astro.it,,"Della Valle, Massimo/0000-0003-3142-5020",,,,26,262,263,0,5,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,21-Dec,2006,444,7122,,,,,1050,1052,,10.1038/nature05374,,3,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,118VH,WOS:000242971100050,17183317,No,,,11/20/17

Long-duration (greater than or similar to 2 s) GRBs are associated with the explosive deaths of massive stars ('collapsars', ref. 1), which produce accompanying supernovae(2-5); the short- duration (less than or similar to 2 s) GRBs have a different origin, which has been argued to be the merger of two compact objects(6-9). Here we report optical observations of GRB 060614 (duration 100 s, ref. 10) that rule out the presence of an associated supernova. This would seem to require a new explosive process: either a massive collapsar that powers a GRB without any associated supernova, or a new type of 'engine', as long-lived as the collapsar but without a massive star.

However, the low intensity of Mercury's magnetic field-about 1% the strength of the Earth's field-cannot be reconciled with an Earth-like dynamo. With the common assumption that Coriolis and Lorentz forces balance in planetary dynamos(1), a field thirty times stronger is expected. Here I present a numerical model of a dynamo driven by thermo-compositional convection associated with inner core solidification. The thermal gradient at the core mantle boundary is subadiabatic(2,3), and hence the outer region of the liquid core is stably stratified with the dynamo operating only at depth, where a strong field is generated. Because of the planet's slow rotation the resulting magnetic field is dominated by small-scale components that fluctuate rapidly with time. The dynamo field diffuses through the stable conducting region, where rapidly varying parts are strongly attenuated by the skin effect, while the slowly varying dipole and quadrupole components pass to some degree. The model explains the observed structure and strength of Mercury's surface magnetic field and makes predictions that are testable with space missions both presently flying and planned.","Max Planck Inst Solar Syst Res, D-37191 Katlenburg Lindau, Germany","Christensen, UR (reprint author), Max Planck Inst Solar Syst Res, Max Planck Str 2, D-37191 Katlenburg Lindau, Germany.",christensen@mps.mpg.de,,,,,,22,104,104,1,14,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,21-Dec,2006,444,7122,,,,,1056,1058,,10.1038/nature05342,,3,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,118VH,WOS:000242971100052,17183319,No,,,11/20/17

While this inner bremsstrahlung branch has been previously measured in nuclear beta and electron capture decay, it has never been observed in free neutron decay. Recently, the photon energy spectrum and branching ratio for neutron radiative decay have been calculated using two approaches: a standard QED framework(1-3) and heavy baryon chiral perturbation theory(4) (an effective theory of hadrons based on the symmetries of quantum chromodynamics). The QED calculation treats the nucleons as point-like, whereas the latter approach includes the effect of nucleon structure in a systematic way. Here we observe the radiative decay mode of free neutrons, measuring photons in coincidence with both the emitted electron and proton. We determined a branching ratio of (3.13 +/- 0.34) x 10(-3) (68 per cent level of confidence) in the energy region between 15 and 340 keV, where the uncertainty is dominated by systematic effects. The value is consistent with the predictions of both theoretical approaches; the characteristic energy spectrum of the radiated photons, which differs from the uncorrelated background spectrum, is also consistent with the calculated spectrum. This result may provide opportunities for more detailed investigations of the weak interaction processes involved in neutron beta decay.","Natl Inst Stand & Technol, Phys Lab, Gaithersburg, MD 20899 USA; Tulane Univ, Dept Phys, New Orleans, LA 70118 USA; Univ Michigan, FOCUS, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; Univ Michigan, Dept Phys, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; Univ Maryland, Dept Phys, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; Univ Sussex, Dept Phys & Astron, Brighton BN1 9QH, E Sussex, England; Natl Inst Stand & Technol, Informat Technol Lab, Boulder, CO 80305 USA","Nico, JS (reprint author), Natl Inst Stand & Technol, Phys Lab, Gaithersburg, MD 20899 USA.",jnico@nist.gov,,,,,,21,25,25,0,3,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,21-Dec,2006,444,7122,,,,,1059,1062,,10.1038/nature05390,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,118VH,WOS:000242971100053,17183320,No,,,11/20/17

Quantifying temporal variations in flow in these ice streams, and understanding their causes, is a prerequisite for estimating the potential contribution of the Antarctic ice sheet to global sea-level change(2,3). Here I show that surface velocities on a major West Antarctic Ice Stream, Rutford Ice Stream, vary periodically by about 20 per cent every two weeks as a result of tidal forcing. Tidally induced motion on ice streams has previously been thought to be limited to diurnal or even shorter-term variations(4-9). The existence of strong fortnightly variations in flow demonstrates the potential pitfalls of using repeated velocity measurements over intervals of days to infer long-term change.","British Antarctic Survey, Cambridge CB3 0ET, England","Gudmundsson, GH (reprint author), British Antarctic Survey, High Cross,Madingley Rd, Cambridge CB3 0ET, England.",ghg@bas.ac.uk,"Gudmundsson, Gudmundur Hilmar/F-6499-2012","Gudmundsson, Gudmundur Hilmar/0000-0003-4236-5369",,,,15,51,52,0,9,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,21-Dec,2006,444,7122,,,,,1063,1064,,10.1038/nature05430,,2,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,118VH,WOS:000242971100054,17183321,No,,,11/20/17

However, in some mammals where females are the primary care-givers, females compete more frequently or intensely with each other than males(3-5). A possible explanation is that, in these species, the resources necessary for successful female reproduction are heavily concentrated and intrasexual competition for breeding opportunities is more intense among females than among males. Intrasexual competition between females is likely to be particularly intense in cooperative breeders where a single female monopolizes reproduction in each group(6). Here, we use data from a twelve-year study of wild meerkats (Suricata suricatta), where females show high levels of reproductive skew, to show that females gain greater benefits from acquiring dominant status than males and traits that increase competitive ability exert a stronger influence on their breeding success. Females that acquire dominant status also develop a suite of morphological, physiological and behavioural characteristics that help them to control other group members. Our results show that sex differences in parental investment are not the only mechanism capable of generating sex differences in reproductive competition and emphasize the extent to which competition for breeding opportunities between females can affect the evolution of sex differences and the operation of sexual selection.","Univ Cambridge, Dept Zool, Cambridge CB2 3EJ, England; Univ Pretoria, Mammal Res Inst, ZA-0002 Pretoria, South Africa; Uppsala Univ, Dept Anim Ecol, SE-75236 Uppsala, Sweden; Univ Sheffield, Dept Anim & Plant Sci, Sheffield S10 2TN, S Yorkshire, England; Univ Stellenbosch, Dept Zool, ZA-7602 Matieland, South Africa; Univ Zurich, Inst Zool, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland","Clutton-Brock, TH (reprint author), Univ Cambridge, Dept Zool, Downing St, Cambridge CB2 3EJ, England.",thcb@cam.ac.uk,"Bennett, Nigel/E-4238-2010","Bennett, Nigel/0000-0001-9748-2947; Spong, Goran/0000-0002-1246-5046",,,,30,152,153,4,124,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,21-Dec,2006,444,7122,,,,,1065,1068,,10.1038/nature05386,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,118VH,WOS:000242971100055,17183322,No,,,11/20/17

Na+ channels were not found in the soma of high-CF (2.5-3.3 kHz) and middle-CF (1.0-2.5 kHz) neurons but were clustered within a short segment of the axon separated by 20-50 mu m from the soma; in low-CF (0.4-1.0 kHz) neurons they were clustered in a longer stretch of the axon closer to the soma. Thus, neurons initiate spikes at a more remote site as the CF of neurons increases. Consequently, the somatic amplitudes of both orthodromic and antidromic spikes were small in high-CF and middle-CF neurons and were large in low-CF neurons. Computer simulation showed that the geometry of the initiation site was optimized to reduce the threshold of spike generation and to increase the ITD sensitivity at each CF. Especially in high-CF neurons, a distant localization of the spike initiation site improved the ITD sensitivity because of electrical isolation of the initiation site from the soma and dendrites, and because of reduction of Na+-channel inactivation by attenuating the temporal summation of synaptic potentials through the low-pass filtering along the axon.","Kyoto Univ, Fac Med, Dept Physiol, Kyoto 6068501, Japan","Ohmori, H (reprint author), Kyoto Univ, Fac Med, Dept Physiol, Kyoto 6068501, Japan.",ohmori@nbiol.med.kyoto-u.ac.jp,"Kuba, Hiroshi/I-7519-2014",,,,,28,119,119,2,12,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,21-Dec,2006,444,7122,,,,,1069,1072,,10.1038/nature05347,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,118VH,WOS:000242971100056,17136099,No,,,11/20/17

Thus, many studies have focused on the developmental origin of T(R) cells, with the prevailing view that they emerge in the thymus from late-stage T-cell progenitors whose T-cell receptors (TCRs) engage high affinity (agonist) ligands(4-6). This study questions the completeness of that interpretation. Here we show that without any obvious effect on TCR-mediated selection, the normal differentiation of mouse gamma delta T cells into potent cytolytic and interferon-gamma-secreting effector cells is switched towards an aggregate regulatory phenotype by limiting the capacity of CD4(+) CD8(+) T-cell progenitors to influence in trans early gamma delta cell progenitors. Unexpectedly, we found that the propensity of early TCR-alpha beta(+) progenitors to differentiate into Foxp3 1 T(R) cells is also regulated in trans by CD4(+) CD8(+) T-cell progenitor cells, before agonist selection.","Guys Hosp, Kings Coll London Sch Med, Peter Gorer Dept Immunobiol, London SE1 9RT, England; Queen Mary Coll, London & Barts Sch Med & Dent, Inst Cell & Mol Sci, London E1 2AT, England; Fac Med Lisbon, Inst Mol Med, P-1649028 Lisbon, Portugal; Inst Child Hlth, Mol Haematol & Canc Biol Unit, Camelia Botnar Labs, London WC1N 1EH, England; Yale Univ, Sch Med, Dept Dermatol, New Haven, CT 06510 USA; Inst Anim Hlth, Compton Lab, Newbury RG20 7NN, Berks, England; Hammersmith Hosp, Imperial Coll, Div Med, London W12 0HS, England","Pennington, DJ (reprint author), Guys Hosp, Kings Coll London Sch Med, Peter Gorer Dept Immunobiol, London SE1 9RT, England.",d.pennington@qmul.ac.uk; adrian.hayday@kcl.ac.uk,"England, Philip/A-1920-2010","England, Philip/0000-0002-9024-8901; Silva-Santos, Bruno/0000-0003-4141-9302","Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council [BBS/E/I/00001048, BBS/E/I/00001160]; Wellcome Trust [, 071534]",,,30,78,80,3,7,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,21-Dec,2006,444,7122,,,,,1073,1077,,10.1038/nature06051,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,118VH,WOS:000242971100057,17190001,No,,,11/20/17

The influenza viral nucleoprotein forms the protein scaffold of the helical genomic ribonucleoprotein complexes, and has a critical role in viral RNA replication(1). Here we report a 3.2 angstrom crystal structure of this nucleoprotein, the overall shape of which resembles a crescent with a head and a body domain, with a protein fold different compared with that of the rhabdovirus nucleoprotein(2,3). Oligomerization of the influenza virus nucleoprotein is mediated by a flexible tail loop that is inserted inside a neighbouring molecule. This flexibility in the tail loop enables the nucleoprotein to form loose polymers as well as rigid helices, both of which are important for nucleoprotein functions. Single residue mutations in the tail loop result in the complete loss of nucleoprotein oligomerization. An RNA-binding groove, which is found between the head and body domains at the exterior of the nucleoprotein oligomer, is lined with highly conserved basic residues widely distributed in the primary sequence. The nucleoprotein structure shows that only one of two proposed nuclear localization signals are accessible, and suggests that the body domain of nucleoprotein contains the binding site for the viral polymerase. Our results identify the tail loop binding pocket as a potential target for antiviral development.","Rice Univ, Dept Biochem & Cell Biol, Houston, TX 77005 USA; Univ Texas, Inst Mol & Cellular Biol, Austin, TX 78712 USA","Tao, YZJ (reprint author), Rice Univ, Dept Biochem & Cell Biol, 6100 Main St,MS140, Houston, TX 77005 USA.",ytao@rice.edu,,,,,,30,245,264,1,35,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,21-Dec,2006,444,7122,,,,,1078,1082,,10.1038/nature05379,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,118VH,WOS:000242971100058,17151603,No,,,11/20/17

Mechanistically, it is unclear how the DII4-mediated Notch pathway contributes to complex vascular processes that demand meticulous coordination of multiple signalling pathways. Here we show that DII4-mediated Notch signalling has a unique role in regulating endothelial cell proliferation and differentiation. Neutralizing DII4 with a DII4-selective antibody rendered endothelial cells hyperproliferative, and caused defective cell fate specification or differentiation both in vitro and in vivo. In addition, blocking DII4 inhibited tumour growth in several tumour models. Remarkably, antibodies against DII4 and antibodies against vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) had paradoxically distinct effects on tumour vasculature. Our data also indicate that DII4-mediated Notch signalling is crucial during active vascularization, but less important for normal vessel maintenance. Furthermore, unlike blocking Notch signalling globally, neutralizing DII4 had no discernable impact on intestinal goblet cell differentiation(4,5), supporting the idea that DII4-mediated Notch signalling is largely restricted to the vascular compartment. Therefore, targeting DII4 might represent a broadly efficacious and well-tolerated approach for the treatment of solid tumours.","Genentech Inc, Tumor Biol & Angiogenesis, San Francisco, CA 94080 USA; Genentech Inc, Antibody Engn, San Francisco, CA 94080 USA; Genentech Inc, Pathol, San Francisco, CA 94080 USA; Genentech Inc, Mol Biol, San Francisco, CA 94080 USA","Yan, MH (reprint author), Genentech Inc, Tumor Biol & Angiogenesis, 1 DNA Way, San Francisco, CA 94080 USA.",minhong@gene.com,,,,,,22,593,627,2,38,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,21-Dec,2006,444,7122,,,,,1083,1087,,10.1038/nature05313,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,118VH,WOS:000242971100059,17183323,No,,,11/20/17

Collectrin associates with multiple apical transporters and defines a novel group of renal amino acid transporters.

With a lethal dose of 1 ng kg(-1), they pose a biological hazard to humans and a serious potential bioweapon threat(1). BoNTs bind with high specificity at neuromuscular junctions and they impair exocytosis of synaptic vesicles containing acetylcholine through specific proteolysis of SNAREs (soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive fusion protein attachment protein receptors), which constitute part of the synaptic vesicle fusion machinery(2,3). The molecular details of the toxin-cell recognition have been elusive. Here we report the structure of a BoNT in complex with its protein receptor: the receptor-binding domain of botulinum neurotoxin serotype B (BoNT/B) bound to the luminal domain of synaptotagmin II, determined at 2.15 angstrom resolution. On binding, a helix is induced in the luminal domain which binds to a saddle-shaped crevice on a distal tip of BoNT/B. This crevice is adjacent to the non-overlapping ganglioside-binding site of BoNT/B. Synaptotagmin II interacts with BoNT/B with nanomolar affinity, at both neutral and acidic endosomal pH. Biochemical and neuronal ex vivo studies of structure-based mutations indicate high specificity and affinity of the interaction, and high selectivity of BoNT/B among synaptotagmin I and II isoforms. Synergistic binding of both synaptotagmin and ganglioside imposes geometric restrictions on the initiation of BoNT/B translocation after endocytosis. Our results provide the basis for the rational development of preventive vaccines or inhibitors against these neurotoxins.","Stanford Univ, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; Stanford Univ, Dept Cellular & Mol Physiol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; Stanford Univ, Dept Neurol & Neurol Sci, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; Stanford Univ, Dept Biol Struct, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; Stanford Univ, Stanford Synchrotron Radiat Lab, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; Hannover Med Sch, Inst Biochem, D-30625 Hannover, Germany; Hannover Med Sch, Inst Toxikol, D-30625 Hannover, Germany","Brunger, AT (reprint author), Stanford Univ, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",brunger@stanford.edu,"Rummel, Andreas/I-7449-2013; Jin, Rongsheng/M-7797-2013","Jin, Rongsheng/0000-0003-0348-7363; Rummel, Andreas/0000-0002-0645-1641; Brunger, Axel/0000-0001-5121-2036",,,,30,153,157,2,11,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,21-Dec,2006,444,7122,,,,,1092,1095,,10.1038/nature05387,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,118VH,WOS:000242971100061,17167421,No,,,11/20/17

A 'double receptor' model has been proposed in which BoNTs recognize nerve terminals via interactions with both gangliosides and protein receptors that mediate their entry(2). Of seven BoNTs (subtypes A-G), the putative receptors for BoNT/A(3,4), BoNT/B(5,6) and BoNT/G(7) have been identified, but the molecular details that govern recognition remain undefined. Here we report the crystal structure of full-length BoNT/B in complex with the synaptotagmin II (Syt-II) recognition domain at 2.6 angstrom resolution. The structure of the complex reveals that Syt-II forms a short helix that binds to a hydrophobic groove within the binding domain of BoNT/B. In addition, mutagenesis of amino acid residues within this interface on Syt-II affects binding of BoNT/B. Structural and sequence analysis reveals that this hydrophobic groove is conserved in the BoNT/G and BoNT/B subtypes, but varies in other clostridial neurotoxins. Furthermore, molecular docking studies using the ganglioside G(T1b) indicate that its binding site is more extensive than previously proposed and might form contacts with both BoNT/B and synaptotagmin. The results provide structural insights into how BoNTs recognize protein receptors and reveal a promising target for blocking toxin-receptor recognition.","Scripps Res Inst, Dept Mol Biol, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; Univ Wisconsin, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Madison, WI 53706 USA; Univ Wisconsin, Dept Physiol, Madison, WI 53706 USA; Univ Wisconsin, Food Res Inst, Dept Food Microbiol & Toxicol, Madison, WI 53706 USA","Stevens, RC (reprint author), Scripps Res Inst, Dept Mol Biol, 10550 N Torrey Pines Rd, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA.",chapman@physiology.wisc.edu; stevens@scripps.edu,,"Stevens, Raymond/0000-0002-4522-8725",,,,29,127,130,1,12,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,21-Dec,2006,444,7122,,,,,1096,1100,,10.1038/nature05411,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,118VH,WOS:000242971100062,17167418,No,,,11/20/17

In three consanguineous families from northern Pakistan, we mapped the condition as an autosomal-recessive trait to chromosome 2q24.3. This region contains the gene SCN9A, encoding the alpha-subunit of the voltage-gated sodium channel, Na(v)1.7, which is strongly expressed in nociceptive neurons. Sequence analysis of SCN9A in affected individuals revealed three distinct homozygous nonsense mutations (S459X, I767X and W897X). We show that these mutations cause loss of function of Nav1.7 by co-expression of wild-type or mutant human Na(v)1.7 with sodium channel beta(1) and beta(2) subunits in HEK293 cells. In cells expressing mutant Nav1.7, the currents were no greater than background. Our data suggest that SCN9A is an essential and non-redundant requirement for nociception in humans.

In Caulobacter crescentus, two-component signal transduction proteins are crucial for cell cycle regulation, but the connectivity of regulators involved has remained elusive and key factors are unidentified. Here we identify ChpT, an essential histidine phosphotransferase that controls the activity of CtrA, the master cell cycle regulator. We show that the essential histidine kinase CckA initiates two phosphorelays, each requiring ChpT, which lead to the phosphorylation and stabilization of CtrA. Downregulation of CckA activity therefore results in the dephosphorylation and degradation of CtrA, which in turn allow the initiation of DNA replication. Furthermore, we show that CtrA triggers its own destruction by promoting cell division and inducing synthesis of the essential regulator DivK, which feeds back to downregulate CckA immediately before S phase. Our results define a single integrated circuit whose components and connectivity can account for the cell cycle oscillations of CtrA in Caulobacter.","Harvard Univ, FAS Ctr Syst Biol, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Plant & Microbial Biol, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA","Laub, MT (reprint author), MIT, Dept Biol, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",laub@mit.edu,,/0000-0002-8288-7607,,,,34,150,152,0,25,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,14-Dec,2006,444,7121,,,,,899,904,,10.1038/nature05321,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,116LW,WOS:000242805400049,17136100,No,,,11/20/17

Mechanisms proposed to remove ancient crust or form younger lowland crust include one or more giant impacts, subcrustal transport by mantle convection, the generation of thinner crust by plate tectonics, and mantle overturn following solidification of an early magma ocean(1-7). The age of the northern lowland crust is a significant constraint on these models. The Mars Advanced Radar for Subsurface and Ionospheric Sounding (MARSIS) instrument on the European Space Agency's Mars Express spacecraft is providing new constraints on the martian subsurface(8). Here we show evidence of buried impact basins ranging in diameter from about 130 km to 470 km found over 14 per cent of the northern lowlands. The number of detected buried basins >200 km in diameter indicates that the lowland crust is ancient, dating back to the Early Noachian epoch. This crater density is a lower limit because of the likelihood that not all buried basins in the area surveyed by MARSIS have been detected. An Early Noachian age for the lowland crust has been previously suggested on the basis of a large number of quasi-circular topographic depressions interpreted to be evidence of buried basins(9-11). Only a few of these depressions in the area surveyed by MARSIS, however, correlate with the detected subsurface echoes. On the basis of the MARSIS data, we conclude that the northern lowland crust is at least as old as the oldest exposed highland crust. This suggests that the crustal dichotomy formed early in the geologic evolution of Mars.","Smithsonian Inst, Natl Air & Space Museum, Ctr Earth & Planetary Studies, Washington, DC 20560 USA; Univ Kansas, Ctr Remote Sensing Ice Sheets, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA; CALTECH, Jet Prop Lab, Pasadena, CA 91109 USA; Univ Roma La Sapienza, Infocom Dept, I-00184 Rome, Italy; Lunar & Planetary Inst, Houston, TX 77058 USA; NASA, Goddard Space Flight Ctr, Greenbelt, MD 20771 USA; Washington Univ, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, St Louis, MO 63130 USA; Proxemy Res, Laytonville, MD 20882 USA","Watters, TR (reprint author), Smithsonian Inst, Natl Air & Space Museum, Ctr Earth & Planetary Studies, Washington, DC 20560 USA.",watterst@si.edu,"Farrell, William/I-4865-2013; Ivanov, Anton/C-8944-2014","Ivanov, Anton/0000-0001-8376-8581",,,,22,30,31,1,6,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,14-Dec,2006,444,7121,,,,,905,908,,10.1038/nature05356,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,116LW,WOS:000242805400050,17167480,No,,,11/20/17

The spin-polarized 'ferromagnetic' superfluid He-3 A(1) phase(2) ( which forms below 3 mK between two transition temperatures, T-c1 and T-c2, in an external magnetic field) serves as a material in which theories of fundamental magnetic processes and macroscopic quantum spin phenomena may be tested. Conventionally, the superfluid component of the A(1) phase is understood(3-6) to contain only the majority spin condensate, having energetically favoured paired spins directed along the external field and no minority spin condensate having paired spins in the opposite direction. Because of difficulties in satisfying both the ultralow temperature and high magnetic field required to produce a substantial phase space, there exist few studies of spin dynamics phenomena that could be used to test the conventional view of the A(1) phase. Here we develop a mechanical spin density detector that operates in the required regime, enabling us to perform measurements of spin relaxation in the A(1) phase as a function of temperature, pressure and magnetic field. Our mechanical spin detector is based in principle on the magnetic fountain effect(7); spin-polarized superfluid motion can be induced both magnetically and mechanically, and we demonstrate the feasibility of increasing spin polarization by a mechanical spin filtering process. In the high temperature range of the A(1) phase near T-c1, the measured spin relaxation time is long, as expected(2,8,9). Unexpectedly, the spin relaxation rate increases rapidly as the temperature is decreased towards T-c2. Our measurements, together with Leggett - Takagi theory(5), demonstrate that a minute presence of minority spin pairs is responsible for this unexpected spin relaxation behaviour. Thus, the long-held conventional view(2) that the A(1) phase contains only the majority spin condensate is inadequate.","Rutgers State Univ, Serin Phys Lab, Piscataway, NJ 08854 USA; Univ Tokyo, Inst Solid State Phys, Chiba 2778581, Japan","Kojima, H (reprint author), Rutgers State Univ, Serin Phys Lab, POB 849, Piscataway, NJ 08854 USA.",kojima@physics.rutgers.edu,"Yamaguchi, Akira/N-1696-2014",,,,,22,11,12,1,5,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,14-Dec,2006,444,7121,,,,,909,912,,10.1038/nature05391,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,116LW,WOS:000242805400051,17167481,No,,,11/20/17

Their outstanding device performance(2-8), relative to that of transistors made of organic thin films, makes them also attractive candidates for electronic applications such as active matrix displays and sensor arrays. These applications require minimal cross-talk between neighbouring devices. In the case of thin film systems, simple patterning of the active semiconductor layer(9,10) minimizes cross-talk. But when using organic single crystals, the only approach currently available for creating arrays of separate devices is manual selection and placing of individual crystals - a process prohibitive for producing devices at high density and with reasonable throughput. In contrast, inorganic crystals have been grown in extended arrays(11-13), and efficient and large-area fabrication of silicon crystalline islands with high mobilities for electronic applications has been reported(14,15). Here we describe a method for effectively fabricating large arrays of single crystals of a wide range of organic semiconductor materials directly onto transistor source - drain electrodes. We find that film domains of octadecyltriethoxysilane microcontact-printed onto either clean Si/SiO2 surfaces or flexible plastic provide control over the nucleation of vapour-grown organic single crystals. This allows us to fabricate large arrays of high-performance organic single-crystal field-effect transistors with mobilities as high as 2.4 cm(2) V-1 s(-1) and on/off ratios greater than 10(7), and devices on flexible substrates that retain their performance after significant bending.

On million-year timescales silicate weathering leads to the draw-down of carbon dioxide(1), and on millennial timescales chemical weathering affects the calcium carbonate saturation state of the oceans and hence their uptake of carbon dioxide(2). However, variations in chemical weathering rates over glacial - interglacial cycles remain uncertain. During glacial periods, cold and dry conditions reduce the rate of chemical weathering(3), but intense physical weathering(3,4) and the exposure of carbonates on continental shelves due to low sea levels(5,6) may increase this rate. Here we present high-resolution records of the lead isotope composition of ferromanganese crusts from the North Atlantic Ocean that cover the past 550,000 years. Combining these records with a simple quantitative model of changes in the lead isotope composition of the deep North Atlantic Ocean in response to chemical weathering, we find that chemical weathering rates were two to three times lower in the glaciated interior of the North Atlantic Region during glacial periods than during the intervening interglacial periods. This decrease roughly balances the increase in chemical weathering caused by the exposure of continental shelves, indicating that chemical weathering rates remained relatively constant on glacial - interglacial timescales. On timescales of more than a million years, however, we suggest that enhanced weathering of silicate glacial sediments during interglacial periods results in a net draw-down of atmospheric carbon dioxide, creating a positive feedback on global climate that, once initiated, promotes cooling and further glaciation.","Univ Bristol, Dept Earth Sci, Bristol Isotope Grp, Bristol BS8 1RJ, Avon, England","Foster, GL (reprint author), Univ Bristol, Dept Earth Sci, Bristol Isotope Grp, Wills Mem Bldg,Queens Rd, Bristol BS8 1RJ, Avon, England.",g.l.foster@bristol.ac.uk,,,,,,29,70,71,0,38,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,14-Dec,2006,444,7121,,,,,918,921,,10.1038/nature05365,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,116LW,WOS:000242805400053,17167483,No,,,11/20/17

If high pore pressure within fault zones is the cause of such weakness, then stress reorientation within or close to a fault is necessary to allow sufficient fault weakening without the occurrence of hydrofracture(4). From field observations of a major tectonic fault, and using laboratory experiments and numerical modelling, here we show that stress rotation occurs within the fractured damage zone surrounding faults. In particular, we find that stress rotation is considerable for unfavourably oriented 'weak' faults. In the 'weak' fault case, the damage-induced change in elastic properties provides the necessary stress rotation to allow high pore pressure faulting without inducing hydrofracture.","Univ Liverpool, Dept Earth & Ocean Sci, Rock Deformat Lab, Liverpool L69 3GP, Merseyside, England","Faulkner, DR (reprint author), Univ Liverpool, Dept Earth & Ocean Sci, Rock Deformat Lab, Liverpool L69 3GP, Merseyside, England.",faulkner@liv.ac.uk,"Healy, David/A-5305-2009; Healy, David/G-2005-2010; Heap, Michael/C-7215-2011; Mitchell, Thomas/D-9903-2011; Faulkner, Daniel/F-7589-2011","Heap, Michael/0000-0002-4748-735X",,,,27,157,161,3,45,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,14-Dec,2006,444,7121,,,,,922,925,,10.1038/nature05353,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,116LW,WOS:000242805400054,17167484,No,,,11/20/17

In contrast, there have only been a few studies of the dynamics and stability of tropical rain forests(18-20). Here we consider the dynamical behaviour of a community, and benchmark it against the exact predictions of a neutral model near or at stationarity. In addition to providing a description of the relative species abundance, our analysis leads to a quantitative understanding of the species turnover distribution and extinction times, and a measure of the temporal scales of neutral evolution. Our model gives a very good description of the large quantity of data collected in Barro Colorado Island in Panama in the period 1990 - 2000 with just three ecologically relevant parameters and predicts the dynamics of extinction of the existing species.","Penn State Univ, Dept Phys, Davey Lab 104, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; Univ Padua, Dipartimento Fis G Galilei, I-35131 Padua, Italy; Niels Bohr Inst, DK-2100 Copenhagen, Denmark","Banavar, JR (reprint author), Penn State Univ, Dept Phys, Davey Lab 104, University Pk, PA 16802 USA.",banavar@psu.edu; maritan@pd.infn.it,"Azaele, Sandro/B-2444-2008; Azaele, Sandro/N-1137-2013","Azaele, Sandro/0000-0002-5153-4833",,,,29,62,64,1,40,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,14-Dec,2006,444,7121,,,,,926,928,,10.1038/nature05320,,3,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,116LW,WOS:000242805400055,17167485,No,,,11/20/17

Of particular interest is whether accumulating deleterious mutations interact, and how the resulting epistatic effects shape the protein's fitness landscape. Here we apply a model system in which bacterial fitness correlates with the enzymatic activity of TEM-1 beta-lactamase ( antibiotic degradation). Subjecting TEM-1 to random mutational drift and purifying selection ( to purge deleterious mutations) produced changes in its fitness landscape indicative of negative epistasis; that is, the combined deleterious effects of mutations were, on average, larger than expected from the multiplication of their individual effects. As observed in computational systems(3-5), negative epistasis was tightly associated with higher tolerance to mutations ( robustness). Thus, under a low selection pressure, a large fraction of mutations was initially tolerated ( high robustness), but as mutations accumulated, their fitness toll increased, resulting in the observed negative epistasis. These findings, supported by FoldX stability computations of the mutational effects(6), prompt a new model in which the mutational robustness ( or neutrality) observed in proteins, and other biological systems, is due primarily to a stability margin, or threshold, that buffers the deleterious physico-chemical effects of mutations on fitness. Threshold robustness is inherently epistatic - once the stability threshold is exhausted, the deleterious effects of mutations become fully pronounced, thereby making proteins far less robust than generally assumed.","Weizmann Inst Sci, Dept Biol Chem, IL-76100 Rehovot, Israel","Tawfik, DS (reprint author), Weizmann Inst Sci, Dept Biol Chem, IL-76100 Rehovot, Israel.",tawfik@weizmann.ac.il,"TOKURIKI, NOBUHIKO/A-2968-2010","Bershtein, Shimon/0000-0003-4322-1025",,,,22,184,186,1,38,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,14-Dec,2006,444,7121,,,,,929,932,,10.1038/nature05385,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,116LW,WOS:000242805400056,17122770,No,,,11/20/17

However, how carbohydrates are transported through the symbiotic interface is still unknown. Here we report the characterization of the first known glomeromycotan monosaccharide transporter, GpMST1, by exploiting the unique symbiosis of a glomeromycotan fungus (Geosiphon pyriformis) with cyanobacteria(5). The GpMST1 gene has a very low GC content and contains six introns with unusual boundaries. GpMST1 possesses twelve predicted transmembrane domains and functions as a proton cotransporter with highest affinity for glucose, then mannose, galactose and fructose.

Immunization with irradiated sporozoites (IrSp) leads to robust protection against malaria infection in rodents(1), monkeys(2) and humans(3) by eliciting antibodies to circumsporozoite protein (CS) that inhibit sporozoite infectivity, and T cells that destroy the EEFs(4). To study the role of non-CS antigens in protection, we produced CS transgenic mice that were tolerant to CS T-cell epitopes. Here we show that in the absence of T-cell-dependent immune responses to CS, protection induced by immunization with two doses of IrSp was greatly reduced. Thus, although hundreds of other Plasmodium genes are expressed in sporozoites(5) and EEFs(6), CS is a dominant protective antigen.

They are activated by guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs), which facilitate the exchange of GDP for GTP(1,2). This activity makes GEFs attractive targets for modulating disease-relevant G-protein-controlled signalling networks(3-5). GEF inhibitors are therefore of interest as tools for elucidating the function of these proteins and for therapeutic intervention; however, only one small molecule GEF inhibitor, brefeldin A (BFA), is currently available(6-9). Here we used an aptamer displacement screen to identify SecinH3, a small molecule antagonist of cytohesins. The cytohesins are a class of BFA-resistant small GEFs for ADP-ribosylation factors (ARFs), which regulate cytoskeletal organization(10), integrin activation(11) or integrin signalling(12). The application of SecinH3 in human liver cells showed that insulin-receptor-complex-associated cytohesins are required for insulin signalling. SecinH3-treated mice show increased expression of gluconeogenic genes, reduced expression of glycolytic, fatty acid and ketone body metabolism genes in the liver, reduced liver glycogen stores, and a compensatory increase in plasma insulin. Thus, cytohesin inhibition results in hepatic insulin resistance. Because insulin resistance is among the earliest pathological changes in type 2 diabetes, our results show the potential of chemical biology for dissecting the molecular pathogenesis of this disease.","Univ Bonn, Kekule Inst Organ Chem & Biochem, LIMES Program Unit Chem Biol & Med Chem, D-53121 Bonn, Germany; Univ Bonn, Lab Mol Immunol, LIMES Program Unit Mol Immune & Cell Biol, D-53115 Bonn, Germany; GSF Forschungszentrum Umwelt & Gesundheit, Inst Mol Immunol, D-81377 Munich, Germany","Famulok, M (reprint author), Univ Bonn, Kekule Inst Organ Chem & Biochem, LIMES Program Unit Chem Biol & Med Chem, Gerhard Domagk Str 1, D-53121 Bonn, Germany.",m.famulok@uni-bonn.de,,"Hafner, Markus/0000-0002-4336-6518",,,,30,157,161,1,21,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,14-Dec,2006,444,7121,,,,,941,944,,10.1038/nature05415,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,116LW,WOS:000242805400059,17167487,No,,,11/20/17

Its activation stimulates a highly conserved downstream kinase cascade that includes phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase ( PI( 3) K) and the serine - threonine protein kinase Akt. This study identifies a new component of insulin signalling in Drosophila, the steppke gene ( step). step encodes a member of the cytohesin family of guanine nucleotide exchange factors ( GEFs), which have been characterized as activators for ADP-ribosylation factor (ARF) GTPases(2-4). In step mutant animals both cell size and cell number are reduced, resulting in decreased body size and body weight in larvae, pupae and adults. step acts upstream of PI( 3) K and is required for the proper regulation of Akt and the transcription factor FOXO. Temporally controlled interference with the GEF activity of the Step protein by feeding the chemical inhibitor SecinH3 causes a block of insulin signalling and a phenocopy of the step mutant growth defect. Step represses its own expression and the synthesis of growth inhibitors such as the translational repressor 4E-BP. Our findings indicate a crucial role of an ARF - GEF in insulin signalling that has implications for understanding insulin-related disorders, such as diabetes and obesity.","Univ Bonn, Lab Mol Dev Biol, LIMES Inst, Program Unit Dev & Genet, D-53115 Bonn, Germany","Hoch, M (reprint author), Univ Bonn, Lab Mol Dev Biol, LIMES Inst, Program Unit Dev & Genet, Meckenheimer Allee 169, D-53115 Bonn, Germany.",m.hoch@uni-bonn.de,,,,,,27,89,90,0,8,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,14-Dec,2006,444,7121,,,,,945,948,,10.1038/nature05412,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,116LW,WOS:000242805400060,17167488,No,,,11/20/17

Mutations in the PKD1 or PKD2 genes lead to autosomal dominant PKD (ADPKD), a slowly developing adult form(4,5). Autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease results from mutations in the PKHD1 gene, affects newborn infants and progresses very rapidly(6,7). No effective treatment is currently available for PKD. A previously unrecognized site of subcellular localization was recently discovered for all proteins known to be disrupted in PKD: primary cilia(8,9). Because ciliary functions seem to be involved in cell cycle regulation, disruption of proteins associated with cilia or centrioles may directly affect the cell cycle and proliferation, resulting in cystic disease(10-12). We therefore reasoned that the dysregulated cell cycle may be the most proximal cause of cystogenesis, and that intervention targeted at this point could provide significant therapeutic benefit for PKD. Here we show that treatment with the cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor (R)-roscovitine does indeed yield effective arrest of cystic disease in jck and cpk mouse models of PKD. Continuous daily administration of the drug is not required to achieve efficacy; pulse treatment provides a robust, long-lasting effect, indicating potential clinical benefits for a lifelong therapy. Molecular studies of the mechanism of action reveal effective cell-cycle arrest, transcriptional inhibition and attenuation of apoptosis. We found that roscovitine is active against cysts originating from different parts of the nephron, a desirable feature for the treatment of ADPKD, in which cysts form in multiple nephron segments. Our results indicate that inhibition of CDK is a new and effective approach to the treatment of PKD.","Genzyme Corp, Cell Biol, Framingham, MA 01701 USA; Genzyme Corp, Genet & Genom, Framingham, MA 01701 USA","Ibraghimov-Beskrovnaya, O (reprint author), Genzyme Corp, Cell Biol, 5 Mt Rd, Framingham, MA 01701 USA.",oxana.beskrovnaya@genzyme.com,,,,,,30,179,187,0,7,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,14-Dec,2006,444,7121,,,,,949,952,,10.1038/nature05348,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,116LW,WOS:000242805400061,17122773,No,,,11/20/17

The mechanisms of punishment and reputation, however, substantially differ in their means for 'disciplining' non-cooperators. Direct punishment incurs salient costs for both the punisher and the punished, whereas reputation mechanisms discipline by withholding action, immediately saving costs for the 'punisher'. Consequently, costly punishment may become extinct in environments in which effective reputation building - for example, through indirect reciprocity - provides a cheaper and powerful way to sustain cooperation. Unexpectedly, as we show here, punishment is maintained when a combination with reputation building is available, however, at a low level. Costly punishment acts are markedly reduced although not simply substituted by appreciating reputation. Indeed, the remaining punishment acts are concentrated on free-riders, who are most severely punished in the combination. When given a choice, subjects even prefer a combination of reputation building with costly punishment. The interaction between punishment and reputation building boosts cooperative efficiency. Because punishment and reputation building are omnipresent interacting forces in human societies, costly punishing should appear less destructive without losing its deterring force.","Univ Erfurt, Dept Econ, D-99089 Erfurt, Germany; Max Planck Inst Limnol, Dept Evolut Ecol, D-24306 Plon, Germany","Rockenbach, B (reprint author), Univ Erfurt, Dept Econ, Nordhauser Str 63, D-99089 Erfurt, Germany.",bettina.rockenbach@uni-erfurt.de; milinski@mpil-ploen.mpg.de,"Henrich, Joseph/A-2403-2009; Rockenbach, Bettina/B-5447-2016","Rockenbach, Bettina/0000-0003-2624-1964",,,,33,217,222,4,92,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,7-Dec,2006,444,7120,,,,,718,723,,10.1038/nature05229,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,113EL,WOS:000242581100051,17151660,No,,,11/20/17

The ability to distinguish between self and non-self is called 'immunological tolerance' and, for T lymphocytes, involves the generation of a diverse pool of functional T cells through positive selection and the removal of overtly self-reactive thymocytes by negative selection during T-cell ontogeny. To elucidate how thymocytes arrive at these cell fate decisions, here we have identified ligands that define an extremely narrow gap spanning the threshold that distinguishes positive from negative selection. We show that, at the selection threshold, a small increase in ligand affinity for the T-cell antigen receptor leads to a marked change in the activation and subcellular localization of Ras and mitogen-activated protein kinase ( MAPK) signalling intermediates and the induction of negative selection. The ability to compartmentalize signalling molecules differentially in the cell endows the thymocyte with the ability to convert a small change in analogue input ( affinity) into a digital output ( positive versus negative selection) and provides the basis for establishing central tolerance.","Univ Basel Hosp, Dept Res, Lab Transplantat Immunol & Nephrol, CH-4031 Basel, Switzerland; Univ Childrens Hosp basel, Ctr Biomed, CH-4058 Basel, Switzerland; Scripps Res Inst, Dept Immunol, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; Rutgers State Univ, Dept Cell Biol & Neurosci, Piscataway, NJ 08854 USA","Palmer, E (reprint author), Univ Basel Hosp, Dept Res, Lab Transplantat Immunol & Nephrol, CH-4031 Basel, Switzerland.",ed.palmer@unibas.ch,,"Gill, Jason/0000-0003-0955-6470; Daniels, Mark/0000-0002-5175-9901",,,,50,325,328,3,13,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,7-Dec,2006,444,7120,,,,,724,729,,10.1038/nature05269,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,113EL,WOS:000242581100052,17086201,No,,,11/20/17

If so, we can then determine how AGN should behave on cosmological timescales by studying the brighter and much faster varying Galactic systems. As X-ray emission is produced very close to the black holes, it provides one of the best diagnostics of their behaviour. A characteristic timescale - which potentially could tell us about the mass of the black hole - is found in the X-ray variations from both AGN and Galactic black holes(1-6), but whether it is physically meaningful to compare the two has been questioned(7). Here we report that, after correcting for variations in the accretion rate, the timescales can be physically linked, revealing that the accretion process is exactly the same for small and large black holes. Strong support for this linkage comes, perhaps surprisingly, from the permitted optical emission lines in AGN whose widths ( in both broad-line AGN and narrow-emission-line Seyfert 1 galaxies) correlate strongly with the characteristic X-ray timescale, exactly as expected from the AGN black hole masses and accretion rates. So AGN really are just scaled-up Galactic black holes.","Univ Southampton, Sch Phys & Astron, Southampton SO17 1BJ, Hants, England; Univ Amsterdam, Astron Inst Anton Pannekoek, NL-1098 SJ Amsterdam, Netherlands","McHardy, IM (reprint author), Univ Southampton, Sch Phys & Astron, Southampton SO17 1BJ, Hants, England.",imh@astro.soton.ac.uk,,,,,,30,317,317,0,1,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,7-Dec,2006,444,7120,,,,,730,732,,10.1038/nature05389,,3,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,113EL,WOS:000242581100053,17151661,No,,,11/20/17

The correlated noise(5-7) observed for bosonic particles ( for example, photons(8) or bosonic neutral atoms(9-14)) can be explained within a classical field description with fluctuating phases; however, the anticorrelations ('antibunching') observed in the detection of fermionic particles have no classical analogue. Observations of such fermionic antibunching are scarce and have been confined to electrons(15-17) and neutrons(18). Here we report the direct observation of antibunching of neutral fermionic atoms. By analysing the atomic shot noise(3,10,19) in a set of standard absorption images of a gas of fermionic K-40 atoms released from an optical lattice, we find reduced correlations for distances related to the original spacing of the trapped atoms. The detection of such quantum statistical correlations has allowed us to characterize the ordering and temperature of the Fermi gas in the lattice. Moreover, our findings are an important step towards revealing fundamental fermionic many-body quantum phases in periodic potentials, which are at the focus of current research.","Johannes Gutenberg Univ Mainz, Inst Phys, D-55128 Mainz, Germany","Bloch, I (reprint author), Johannes Gutenberg Univ Mainz, Inst Phys, Staudingerweg 7, D-55128 Mainz, Germany.",bloch@uni-mainz.de,"Bloch, Immanuel/G-3174-2010; Schneider, Ulrich/N-4820-2015; van Oosten, Dries/H-9287-2016","Bloch, Immanuel/0000-0002-0679-4759; Schneider, Ulrich/0000-0003-4345-9498; Folling, Simon/0000-0002-6951-3651",,,,31,175,175,1,16,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,7-Dec,2006,444,7120,,,,,733,736,,10.1038/nature05319,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,113EL,WOS:000242581100054,17151662,No,,,11/20/17

These high acceleration gradients, of a few hundreds of gigavolts per metre, hold the promise of compact high-energy particle accelerators. Recently, several experiments have shown that laser-plasma accelerators can produce high-quality electron beams, with quasi-monoenergetic energy distributions at the 100 MeV level(2-4). However, these beams do not have the stability and reproducibility that are required for applications. This is because the mechanism responsible for injecting electrons into the wakefield is based on highly nonlinear phenomena(5), and is therefore hard to control. Here we demonstrate that the injection and subsequent acceleration of electrons can be controlled by using a second laser pulse(6). The collision of the two laser pulses provides a pre-acceleration stage which provokes the injection of electrons into the wakefield. The experimental results show that the electron beams obtained in this manner are collimated ( 5 mrad divergence), monoenergetic ( with energy spread <10 per cent), tuneable ( between 15 and 250 MeV) and, most importantly, stable. In addition, the experimental observations are compatible with electron bunch durations shorter than 10 fs. We anticipate that this stable and compact electron source will have a strong impact on applications requiring short bunches, such as the femtolysis of water 7, or high stability, such as radiotherapy with high- energy electrons(8,9) or radiography(10) for materials science.","Ecole Polytech, CNRS, UMR 7639, ENSTA,Lab Opt Appl, F-91761 Palaiseau, France","Malka, V (reprint author), Ecole Polytech, CNRS, UMR 7639, ENSTA,Lab Opt Appl, F-91761 Palaiseau, France.",victor.malka@ensta.fr,"Malka, Victor/F-5260-2010; Faure, Jerome/N-5873-2017","Faure, Jerome/0000-0003-0538-5774",,,,20,512,522,9,81,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,7-Dec,2006,444,7120,,,,,737,739,,10.1038/nature05393,,3,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,113EL,WOS:000242581100055,17151663,No,,,11/20/17

Using an aperture NSOM with visible laser illumination, a near-field interference pattern around a corral structure has been observed(9), whose features were similar to the scanning tunnelling microscope image of the electronic waves in a quantum corral(10).

The first step, which occurred similar to 2,300 million years (Myr) ago, involved a significant increase in atmospheric oxygen concentrations and oxygenation of the surface ocean(1,2). A further increase in atmospheric oxygen appears to have taken place during the late Neoproterozoic period(3,4) (similar to 800-542 Myr ago). This increase may have stimulated the evolution of macroscopic multicellular animals and the subsequent radiation of calcified invertebrates(4,5), and may have led to oxygenation of the deep ocean(6). However, the nature and timing of Neoproterozoic oxidation remain uncertain. Here we present high-resolution carbon isotope and sulphur isotope records from the Huqf Supergroup, Sultanate of Oman, that cover most of the Ediacaran period (similar to 635 to similar to 548 Myr ago). These records indicate that the ocean became increasingly oxygenated after the end of the Marinoan glaciation, and they allow us to identify three distinct stages of oxidation. When considered in the context of other records from this period(7-15), our data indicate that certain groups of eukaryotic organisms appeared and diversified during the second and third stages of oxygenation. The second stage corresponds with the Shuram excursion in the carbon isotope record(16) and seems to have involved the oxidation of a large reservoir of organic carbon suspended in the deep ocean(6), indicating that this event may have had a key role in the evolution of eukaryotic organisms. Our data thus provide new insights into the oxygenation of the Ediacaran ocean and the stepwise restructuring of the carbon(6,16,17) and sulphur cycles(3,18,19) that occurred during this significant period of Earth's history.","MIT, Dept Earth Atmospher & Planetary Sci, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; Indiana Univ, Dept Geol Sci, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA","Fike, DA (reprint author), MIT, Dept Earth Atmospher & Planetary Sci, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",dfike@mit.edu,"Fike, David/D-3634-2011","Fike, David/0000-0003-2848-0328",,,,30,411,458,1,106,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,7-Dec,2006,444,7120,,,,,744,747,,10.1038/nature05345,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,113EL,WOS:000242581100057,17151665,No,,,11/20/17

High-resolution micro-computed tomography now allows us to image complex structures and uncover subtle differences in adult tooth morphology that are determined early in embryonic development(3). Here we show that the timing of molar crown and root completion in Neanderthals matches those known for modern humans but that a more complex enamel - dentine junction morphology and a late peak in root extension rate sets them apart.

Each day, more than a hundred million tons of carbon in the form of CO2 are fixed into organic material by these ubiquitous, microscopic plants of the upper ocean, and each day a similar amount of organic carbon is transferred into marine ecosystems by sinking and grazing. The distribution of phytoplankton biomass and NPP is defined by the availability of light and nutrients ( nitrogen, phosphate, iron). These growth-limiting factors are in turn regulated by physical processes of ocean circulation, mixed-layer dynamics, upwelling, atmospheric dust deposition, and the solar cycle. Satellite measurements of ocean colour provide a means of quantifying ocean productivity on a global scale and linking its variability to environmental factors. Here we describe global ocean NPP changes detected from space over the past decade. The period is dominated by an initial increase in NPP of 1,930 teragrams of carbon a year (Tg C yr(-1)), followed by a prolonged decrease averaging 190 Tg C yr(-1). These trends are driven by changes occurring in the expansive stratified low-latitude oceans and are tightly coupled to coincident climate variability. This link between the physical environment and ocean biology functions through changes in upper-ocean temperature and stratification, which influence the availability of nutrients for phytoplankton growth. The observed reductions in ocean productivity during the recent post-1999 warming period provide insight on how future climate change can alter marine food webs.","Oregon State Univ, Dept Bot & Plant Pathol, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA; Oregon State Univ, Coll Oceanog & Atmospher Sci, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA; Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Geog, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Inst Computat Earth Syst Sci, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; NASA, Goddard Space Flight Ctr, Greenbelt, MD 20771 USA; Princeton Univ, Atmospher & Ocean Sci Program, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; Rutgers State Univ, Dept Geol Sci, New Brunswick, NJ 08901 USA; Rutgers State Univ, Inst Marine & Coastal Sci, Environm Biophys & Mol Ecol Program, New Brunswick, NJ 08901 USA; Univ Maine, Sch Marine Sci, Orono, ME 04469 USA","Behrenfeld, MJ (reprint author), Oregon State Univ, Dept Bot & Plant Pathol, 2082 Cordley Hall, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA.",mjb@science.oregonstate.edu,"Letelier, Ricardo/A-6953-2009; Siegel, David/C-5587-2008; Smith, Christa/G-3187-2010; Boss, Emmanuel/C-5765-2009","Letelier, Ricardo/0000-0003-3376-4026; Boss, Emmanuel/0000-0002-8334-9595",,,,26,888,923,52,655,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,7-Dec,2006,444,7120,,,,,752,755,,10.1038/nature05317,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,113EL,WOS:000242581100059,17151666,No,,,11/20/17

The mechanisms underlying tumour radioresistance have remained elusive. Here we show that cancer stem cells contribute to glioma radioresistance through preferential activation of the DNA damage checkpoint response and an increase in DNA repair capacity. The fraction of tumour cells expressing CD133 (Prominin-1), a marker for both neural stem cells and brain cancer stem cells(3-6), is enriched after radiation in gliomas. In both cell culture and the brains of immunocompromised mice, CD133-expressing glioma cells survive ionizing radiation in increased proportions relative to most tumour cells, which lack CD133. CD133-expressing tumour cells isolated from both human glioma xenografts and primary patient glioblastoma specimens preferentially activate the DNA damage checkpoint in response to radiation, and repair radiation-induced DNA damage more effectively than CD133-negative tumour cells. In addition, the radioresistance of CD133-positive glioma stem cells can be reversed with a specific inhibitor of the Chk1 and Chk2 checkpoint kinases. Our results suggest that CD133-positive tumour cells represent the cellular population that confers glioma radioresistance and could be the source of tumour recurrence after radiation.

Transient in vitro exposure to BMP4 abolishes the capacity of transplanted GBM cells to establish intracerebral GBMs. Most importantly, in vivo delivery of BMP4 effectively blocks the tumour growth and associated mortality that occur in 100% of mice after intracerebral grafting of human GBM cells. We demonstrate that BMPs activate their cognate receptors (BMPRs) and trigger the Smad signalling cascade in cells isolated from human glioblastomas ( GBMs). This is followed by a reduction in proliferation, and increased expression of markers of neural differentiation, with no effect on cell viability. The concomitant reduction in clonogenic ability, in the size of the CD133(+) population and in the growth kinetics of GBM cells indicates that BMP4 reduces the tumour-initiating cell pool of GBMs. These findings show that the BMP - BMPR signalling system - which controls the activity of normal brain stem cells(2,3) - may also act as a key inhibitory regulator of tumour-initiating, stem-like cells from GBMs and the results also identify BMP4 as a novel, non-cytotoxic therapeutic effector, which may be used to prevent growth and recurrence of GBMs in humans.","Univ Milano Bicocca, Dept Biosci & Biotechnol, I-20126 Milan, Italy; Univ Milano Bicocca, StemGen Spa, Unit Canc Stem Cell Biol, I-20126 Milan, Italy; Univ Queensland, Queensland Brain Inst, Lab Neural Stem Cell Biol, Brisbane, Qld, Australia; Hosp San Raffaele, Stem Cell Res Inst, I-20132 Milan, Italy; Natl Neurol Inst C Besta, I-20133 Milan, Italy; Johns Hopkins Univ, Dept Neurosurg, Baltimore, MD 21287 USA","Vescovi, AL (reprint author), Univ Milano Bicocca, Dept Biosci & Biotechnol, I-20126 Milan, Italy.",vescovi@tin.it,"Olivi, Alessandro/K-6531-2016; Binda, Elena/B-2650-2017","Olivi, Alessandro/0000-0002-4489-7564; Binda, Elena/0000-0002-8750-2905; Piccirillo, Sara Grazia Maria/0000-0003-4109-1992; DiMeco, Francesco/0000-0001-6213-5793",,,,31,743,783,5,58,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,7-Dec,2006,444,7120,,,,,761,765,,10.1038/nature05349,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,113EL,WOS:000242581100061,17151667,No,,,11/20/17

They are found throughout the Eukarya, functioning in core cellular processes such as endocytosis and organelle division(1). Many bacteria are predicted by sequence to possess large GTPases with the same multidomain architecture that is found in DLPs(2). Mechanistic dissection of dynamin family members has been impeded by a lack of high-resolution structural data currently restricted to the GTPase(3,4) and pleckstrin homology(5) domains, and the dynamin-related human guanylate-binding protein(6). Here we present the crystal structure of a cyanobacterial DLP in both nucleotide-free and GDP-associated conformation. The bacterial DLP shows dynamin-like qualities, such as helical self-assembly and tubulation of a lipid bilayer. In vivo, it localizes to the membrane in a manner reminiscent of FZL(7), a chloroplast-specific dynamin-related protein with which it shares sequence similarity. Our results provide structural and mechanistic insight that may be relevant across the dynamin superfamily. Concurrently, we show compelling similarity between a cyanobacterial and chloroplast DLP that, given the endosymbiotic ancestry of chloroplasts(8), questions the evolutionary origins of dynamins.","MRC, Mol Biol Lab, Cambridge CB2 2QH, England","Lowe, J (reprint author), MRC, Mol Biol Lab, Hills Rd, Cambridge CB2 2QH, England.",jyl@mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk,"Lowe, Jan/B-3882-2011","Lowe, Jan/0000-0002-5218-6615",Medical Research Council [MC_U105184326],,,28,120,124,0,14,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,7-Dec,2006,444,7120,,,,,766,769,,10.1038/nature05312,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,113EL,WOS:000242581100062,17122778,No,,,11/20/17

The renotropic activity of circulating FGF23 indicates the possible presence of an FGF23-specific receptor in the kidney(6). Here we show that a previously undescribed receptor conversion by Klotho, a senescence-related molecule(7), generates the FGF23 receptor. Using a renal homogenate, we found that Klotho binds to FGF23. Forced expression of Klotho enabled the high-affinity binding of FGF23 to the cell surface and restored the ability of a renal cell line to respond to FGF23 treatment. Moreover, FGF23 incompetence was induced by injecting wild-type mice with an anti-Klotho monoclonal antibody. Thus, Klotho is essential for endogenous FGF23 function. Because Klotho alone seemed to be incapable of intracellular signalling, we searched for other components of the FGF23 receptor and found FGFR1(IIIc), which was directly converted by Klotho into the FGF23 receptor. Thus, the concerted action of Klotho and FGFR1( IIIc) reconstitutes the FGF23 receptor. These findings provide insights into the diversity and specificity of interactions between FGF and FGF receptors.","Kirin Brewery Co Ltd, Pharmaceut Res Labs, Gunma 3701295, Japan; Tokyo Univ Hosp, Dept Internal Med, Div Nephrol & Endocrinol, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo 1138655, Japan","Urakawa, I (reprint author), Kirin Brewery Co Ltd, Pharmaceut Res Labs, 3 Miyahara, Gunma 3701295, Japan.",iurakawa@kirin.co.jp,,,,,,30,858,912,5,58,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,7-Dec,2006,444,7120,,,,,770,774,,10.1038/nature05315,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,113EL,WOS:000242581100063,17086194,No,,,11/20/17
