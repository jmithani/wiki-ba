Whereas the light noble gases ( helium and neon) in the Earth's mantle preserve a solar-like isotopic composition, heavy noble gases ( argon, krypton and xenon) have an isotopic composition very similar to that of the modern atmosphere, with radiogenic and ( in the case of xenon) solar contributions. Mantle noble gases in a magmatic CO2 natural gas field have been previously corrected for shallow atmosphere/groundwater and crustal additions. Here we analyse new data from this field and show that the elemental composition of non-radiogenic heavy noble gases in the mantle is remarkably similar to that of sea water. We challenge the popular concept of a noble gas `subduction barrier' - the convecting mantle noble gas isotopic and elemental composition is explained by subduction of sediment and seawater-dominated pore fluids. This accounts for similar to 100% of the non-radiogenic argon and krypton and 80% of the xenon. Approximately 50% of the convecting mantle water concentration can then be explained by this mechanism. Enhanced recycling of subducted material to the mantle plume source region then accounts for the lower ratio of radiogenic to non-radiogenic heavy noble gas isotopes and higher water content of plume-derived basalts.","Univ Manchester, Sch Earth Atmospher & Environm Sci, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England","Holland, G (reprint author), Univ Manchester, Sch Earth Atmospher & Environm Sci, Oxford Rd, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England.",g.holland@manchester.ac.uk,,"Ballentine, Chris/0000-0001-9382-070X",,,,49,105,107,3,28,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,11-May,2006,441,7090,,,,,186,191,,10.1038/nature04761,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,040YP,WOS:000237418800038,16688169,No,,,11/20/17

Its inclined and circular orbit lies between a group of small inner prograde satellites and a number of exterior irregular satellites with both prograde and retrograde orbits. This unusual configuration has led to the belief that Triton originally orbited the Sun before being captured in orbit around Neptune(1-3). Existing models(4-6) for its capture, however, all have significant bottlenecks that make their effectiveness doubtful. Here we report that a three-body gravitational encounter between a binary system (of similar to 10(3)-kilometre-sized bodies) and Neptune is a far more likely explanation for Triton's capture. Our model predicts that Triton was once a member of a binary with a range of plausible characteristics, including ones similar to the Pluto - Charon pair.","Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Earth Sci, Ctr Origin Dynam & Evolut Planets, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA; Univ Maryland, Dept Astron, College Pk, MD 20742 USA","Agnor, CB (reprint author), Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Earth Sci, Ctr Origin Dynam & Evolut Planets, 1156 High St, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA.",cagnor@pmc.ucsc.edu,,,,,,30,104,107,0,16,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,11-May,2006,441,7090,,,,,192,194,,10.1038/nature04792,,3,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,040YP,WOS:000237418800039,16688170,No,,,11/20/17

In these materials, strong electronic correlations often lead to competing ground states that are sensitive to many parameters - in particular the doping level so that complex phase diagrams are observed. A flexible way to explore the role of doping is to tune the electron or hole concentration with electric fields, as is done in standard semiconductor field effect transistors(3). Here we demonstrate a model oxide system based on high-quality heterostructures in which the ferroelectric field effect approach can be studied. We use a single-crystal film of the perovskite superconductor Nb-doped SrTiO3 as the superconducting channel and ferroelectric Pb(Zr, Ti) O-3 as the gate oxide. Atomic force microscopy is used to locally reverse the ferroelectric polarization, thus inducing large resistivity and carrier modulations, resulting in a clear shift in the superconducting critical temperature. Field-induced switching from the normal state to the ( zero resistance) superconducting state was achieved at a well-defined temperature. This unique system could lead to a field of research in which devices are realized by locally defining in the same material superconducting and normal regions with `perfect' interfaces, the interface being purely electronic. Using this approach, one could potentially design one-dimensional superconducting wires, superconducting rings and junctions, superconducting quantum interference devices ( SQUIDs) or arrays of pinning centres.","Univ Geneva, DPMC, CH-1211 Geneva 4, Switzerland; Univ Paris 11, Phys Solides Lab, F-91405 Orsay, France; Univ Tokyo, Inst Solid State Phys, Chiba 2778581, Japan","Triscone, JM (reprint author), Univ Geneva, DPMC, 24 Quai Ernest Ansermet, CH-1211 Geneva 4, Switzerland.",Jean-Marc.Triscone@physics.unige.ch,"Kim, Yu Jin/A-2433-2012; Shibuya, Keisuke/K-2079-2012; Takahashi, Kei/B-2498-2013; OHNISHI, Tsuyoshi/H-2670-2011","OHNISHI, Tsuyoshi/0000-0002-2333-7752",,,,24,57,58,6,110,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,11-May,2006,441,7090,,,,,195,198,,10.1038/nature04731,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,040YP,WOS:000237418800040,16688171,No,,,11/20/17

The slow progress within silicon optoelectronics, where electronic and optical functionalities can be integrated into monolithic components based on the versatile silicon platform, is due to the limited active optical properties of silicon(3). Recently, however, a continuous-wave Raman silicon laser was demonstrated(4); if an effective modulator could also be realized in silicon, data processing and transmission could potentially be performed by all-silicon electronic and optical components. Here we have discovered that a significant linear electro-optic effect is induced in silicon by breaking the crystal symmetry. The symmetry is broken by depositing a straining layer on top of a silicon waveguide, and the induced nonlinear coefficient, chi(2) approximate to 15 pm V-1, makes it possible to realize a silicon electro-optic modulator. The strain-induced linear electro-optic effect may be used to remove a bottleneck(5) in modern computers by replacing the electronic bus with a much faster optical alternative.","Tech Univ Denmark, Nano DTU, Dept Commun Opt & Mat, COM DTU, DK-2800 Lyngby, Denmark; Tech Univ Denmark, Nano DTU, MIC Dept Micro & Nanotechnol, CINF, DK-2800 Lyngby, Denmark","Jacobsen, RS (reprint author), Tech Univ Denmark, Nano DTU, Dept Commun Opt & Mat, COM DTU, Bldg 345V, DK-2800 Lyngby, Denmark.",Rune@com.dtu.dk,"Hansen, Ole/C-4480-2011; Frandsen, Lars Hagedorn/B-4535-2012; Peucheret, Christophe/C-1359-2011; Lavrinenko, Andrei/E-4099-2015; Ou, Haiyan/D-8728-2011","Hansen, Ole/0000-0002-6090-8323; Frandsen, Lars Hagedorn/0000-0001-9145-2210; Peucheret, Christophe/0000-0002-1655-9293; Ou, Haiyan/0000-0002-0538-8230",,,,26,378,380,9,127,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,11-May,2006,441,7090,,,,,199,202,,10.1038/nature04706,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,040YP,WOS:000237418800041,16688172,No,,,11/20/17

Meteorites analysed to date, however, are unlikely to be representative of the entire population and it is also possible that changes in their nature have occurred with time(1). Large objects are widely believed to be completely melted or vaporized during high-angle impact with the Earth(2,3). Consequently, identification of large impactors relies on indirect chemical tracers, notably the platinum-group elements(4). Here we report the discovery of a large (25-cm), unaltered, fossil meteorite, and several smaller fragments within the impact melt of the giant (> 70 km diameter), 145-Myr-old Morokweng crater, South Africa. The large fragment ( clast) resembles an LL6 chondrite breccia, but contains anomalously iron-rich silicates, Fe-Ni sulphides, and no troilite or metal. It has chondritic chromium isotope ratios and identical platinum-group element ratios to the bulk impact melt. These features allow the unambiguous characterization of an impactor at a large crater. Furthermore, the unusual composition of the meteorite suggests that the Morokweng asteroid incorporated part of the LL chondrite parent body not represented by objects at present reaching the Earth.","Univ Quebec, Chicoutimi, PQ G7H 2B1, Canada; Univ Pretoria, Dept Geol, ZA-0002 Pretoria, South Africa; S African Nucl Energy Corp, ZA-0001 Pretoria, South Africa; Univ Witwatersrand, Sch Geosci, ZA-2050 Wits, South Africa; Cardiff Univ, Sch Earth Ocean & Planetary Sci, Cardiff CF10 3YE, Wales; Scottish Univ Environm Res Ctr, E Kilbride G75 0QF, Lanark, Scotland; Univ Calif San Diego, Scripps Inst Oceanog, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; Indiana Univ, Dept Geol Sci, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA; Ithemba LABS Gauteng, ZA-2050 Wits, South Africa","Maier, WD (reprint author), Univ Quebec, Chicoutimi, PQ G7H 2B1, Canada.",wolfgang_maier@uqac.ca,"Boyce, Adrian/D-2263-2010","Boyce, Adrian/0000-0002-9680-0787; McDonald, Iain/0000-0001-9066-7244",,,,33,39,39,0,12,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,11-May,2006,441,7090,,,,,203,206,,10.1038/nature04751,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,040YP,WOS:000237418800042,16688173,No,,,11/20/17

Here I add many new radiocarbon dates to those already published on late Pleistocene fossils from Alaska and the Yukon Territory (AK - YT) and show previously unrecognized patterns. Species that survived the Pleistocene, for example, bison ( Bison priscus, which evolved into Bison bison), wapiti (Cervus canadensis) and, to a smaller degree, moose (Alces alces), began to increase in numbers and continued to do so before and during human colonization and before the regional extinction of horse ( Equus ferus) and mammoth (Mammuthus primigenius). These patterns allow us to reject, at least in AK - YT, some hypotheses of late Pleistocene extinction: 'Blitzkrieg' version of simultaneous human overkill(2), 'keystone' removal(3), and 'palaeo-disease'(4). Hypotheses of a subtler human impact and/or ecological replacement or displacement are more consistent with the data. The new patterns of dates indicate a radical ecological sorting during a uniquely forage-rich transitional period, affecting all large mammals, including humans.","Univ Alaska, Inst Arctic Biol, Fairbanks, AK 99709 USA","Guthrie, RD (reprint author), Univ Alaska, Inst Arctic Biol, Fairbanks, AK 99709 USA.",ffrdg@uaf.edu,,,,,,30,150,157,21,182,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,11-May,2006,441,7090,,,,,207,209,,10.1038/nature04604,,3,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,040YP,WOS:000237418800043,16688174,No,,,11/20/17

Allopatric speciation, the divergence of species resulting from geographical isolation, is well documented(1). However, sympatric speciation, divergence without geographical isolation, is highly controversial(2). Claims of sympatric speciation must demonstrate species sympatry, sister relationships, reproductive isolation, and that an earlier allopatric phase is highly unlikely(1). Here we provide clear support for sympatric speciation in a case study of two species of palm ( Arecaceae) on an oceanic island. A large dated phylogenetic tree shows that the two species of Howea, endemic to the remote Lord Howe Island, are sister taxa and diverged from each other well after the island was formed 6.9 million years ago(3). During fieldwork, we found a substantial disjunction in flowering time that is correlated with soil preference. In addition, a genome scan(4,5) indicates that few genetic loci are more divergent between the two species than expected under neutrality, a finding consistent with models of sympatric speciation involving disruptive/ divergent selection(2). This case study of sympatric speciation in plants provides an opportunity for refining theoretical models on the origin of species, and new impetus for exploring putative plant and animal examples on oceanic islands.","Royal Bot Gardens, Richmond TW9 3DS, Surrey, England; Ctr Evolutionary & Funct Ecol, UMR 5175, F-34293 Montpellier 5, France; Aarhus Univ, Dept Systemat Bot, DK-8000 Aarhus C, Denmark; Univ Lausanne, Dept Ecol & Evolut, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland","Savolainen, V (reprint author), Royal Bot Gardens, Richmond TW9 3DS, Surrey, England.",v.savolainen@kew.org,"Baker, William/B-1244-2011; Lexer, Christian/N-3702-2013; Anstett, Marie Charlotte/N-7977-2017","Baker, William/0000-0001-6727-1831; Anstett, Marie Charlotte/0000-0001-7786-0357; Savolainen, Vincent/0000-0001-5350-9984",,,,30,341,356,16,261,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,11-May,2006,441,7090,,,,,210,213,,10.1038/nature04566,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,040YP,WOS:000237418800044,16467788,No,,,11/20/17

Kin selection(1) provides a widely accepted theoretical framework for understanding these societies, but differences in genetic relatedness do not explain a universal societal feature: the huge variation between individuals in helping effort(2-10). An alternative explanation for this variation lies in a fundamental trade-off faced by helpers: by working harder, they increase the indirect component of their fitness, but simultaneously decrease their own future survival and fecundity(2,4,8). Here, we show that individuals work less hard when they stand to lose more future fitness through working. We experimentally manipulated two components of future fitness in social queues of hover wasps (Stenogastrinae): a helper's chance of inheriting an egg-laying position, and the workforce available to rear her offspring should she inherit. After each manipulation, helpers increased or decreased their effort as appropriate to the change in expected future fitness that they experienced. Although helping provides significant indirect fitness benefits for hover wasps(11), our study shows that variation in the costs associated with helping is the major determinant of helping effort.","UCL, Dept Biol, London NW1 2HE, England","Field, J (reprint author), UCL, Dept Biol, Wolfson House,4 Stephenson Way, London NW1 2HE, England.",jeremy.field@ucl.ac.uk,,,,,,28,71,76,0,33,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,11-May,2006,441,7090,,,,,214,217,,10.1038/nature04560,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,040YP,WOS:000237418800045,16688175,No,,,11/20/17

Neural crest cells originate along the border between the neural plate and epidermis(1), migrate extensively and generate numerous derivatives, including neurons and glia of the peripheral nervous system, melanocytes, bone and cartilage of the head skeleton(2). Impaired neural crest development is associated with human defects, including cleft palate(3). Classically, the neural crest has been thought to form by interactions at the border between neural and non-neural ectoderm or mesoderm(4-7), and defined factors such as bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) and Wnt proteins have been postulated as neural crest-inducers(8-13). Although competence to induce crest cells declines after stage 10 ( ref. 14), little is known about when neural crest induction begins in vivo. Here we report that neural crest induction is underway during gastrulation and well before proper neural plate appearance. We show that a restricted region of chick epiblast ( stage 3 - 4) is specified to generate neural crest cells when explanted under non-inducing conditions. This region expresses the transcription factor Pax7 by stage 41 and later contributes to neural folds and migrating neural crest. In chicken embryos, Pax7 is required for neural crest formation in vivo, because blocking its translation inhibits expression of the neural crest markers Slug, Sox9, Sox10 and HNK-1. Our results indicate that neural crest specification initiates earlier than previously assumed, independently of mesodermal and neural tissues, and that Pax7 has a crucial function during neural crest development.","CALTECH, Div Biol 139 74, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA; Yale Univ, MCDB, New Haven, CT 06520 USA","Garcia-Castro, MI (reprint author), CALTECH, Div Biol 139 74, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA.",martin.garcia-castro@yale.edu,"Basch, Martin/I-6632-2012","Bronner, Marianne/0000-0003-4274-1862",,,,30,172,175,4,20,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,11-May,2006,441,7090,,,,,218,222,,10.1038/nature04684,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,040YP,WOS:000237418800046,16688176,No,,,11/20/17

There is no intrinsically 'correct' answer: economic choice depends on subjective preferences. This behaviour is traditionally the object of economic analysis(1) and is also of primary interest in psychology(2). However, the underlying mental processes and neuronal mechanisms are not well understood. Theories of human and animal choice(1-3) have a cornerstone in the concept of 'value'. Consider, for example, a monkey offered one raisin versus one piece of apple: behavioural evidence suggests that the animal chooses by assigning values to the two options(4). But where and how values are represented in the brain is unclear. Here we show that, during economic choice, neurons in the orbitofrontal cortex(5-18) (OFC) encode the value of offered and chosen goods. Notably, OFC neurons encode value independently of visuospatial factors and motor responses. If a monkey chooses between A and B, neurons in the OFC encode the value of the two goods independently of whether A is presented on the right and B on the left, or vice versa. This trait distinguishes the OFC from other brain areas in which value modulates activity related to sensory or motor processes(19-25). Our results have broad implications for possible psychological models, suggesting that economic choice is essentially choice between goods rather than choice between actions. In this framework, neurons in the OFC seem to be a good candidate network for value assignment underlying economic choice.","Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Neurobiol, Boston, MA 02115 USA","Padoa-Schioppa, C (reprint author), Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Neurobiol, 220 Longwood Ave, Boston, MA 02115 USA.",camillo@alum.mit.edu,,"Padoa-Schioppa, Camillo/0000-0002-7519-8790","NINDS NIH HHS [R01 NS041000-01, R01 NS041000]",,,30,671,682,3,49,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,11-May,2006,441,7090,,,,,223,226,,10.1038/nature04676,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,040YP,WOS:000237418800047,16633341,No,,,11/20/17

Variations in branching patterns lead to diversity in flower-bearing architectures ( inflorescences) and affect crop yield by influencing seed number or harvesting ability(2,3). Several growth regulators such as auxins, cytokinins and carotenoid derivatives regulate branching architectures(4). Inflorescence branching in maize is regulated by three RAMOSA genes(5). Here we show that one of these genes, RAMOSA3 (RA3), encodes a trehalose-6-phosphate phosphatase expressed in discrete domains subtending axillary inflorescence meristems. Genetic and molecular data indicate that RA3 functions through the predicted transcriptional regulator RAMOSA1 (RA1)(5). We propose that RA3 regulates inflorescence branching by modification of a sugar signal that moves into axillary meristems.

Like T(H)1 and T(H)2, T(H)17 cells almost certainly evolved to provide adaptive immunity tailored to specific classes of pathogens(3), such as extracellular bacteria(4). Aberrant T(H)17 responses have been implicated in a growing list of autoimmune disorders(5-7). T(H)17 development has been linked to IL-23, an IL-12 cytokine family member that shares with IL-12 a common subunit, IL-12p40 (ref. 8). The IL-23 and IL-12 receptors also share a subunit, IL-12R beta 1, that pairs with unique, inducible components, IL-23R and IL-12R beta 2, to confer receptor responsiveness(9). Here we identify transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) as a cytokine critical for commitment to T(H)17 development. TGF-beta acts to upregulate IL-23R expression, thereby conferring responsiveness to IL-23. Although dispensable for the development of IL-17-producing T cells in vitro and in vivo, IL-23 is required for host protection against a bacterial pathogen, Citrobacter rodentium. The action of TGF-beta on naive T cells is antagonized by interferon-gamma and IL-4, thus providing a mechanism for divergence of the T(H)1, T(H)2 and T(H)17 lineages.","Univ Alabama, Dept Pathol, Birmingham, AL 35294 USA; Univ Alabama, Dept Microbiol, Birmingham, AL 35294 USA; Univ Alabama, Dept Genom, Birmingham, AL 35294 USA; Univ Alabama, Dept Med, Birmingham, AL 35294 USA; Natl Inst Dent & Craniofacial Dis, Cellular Immunol Sect, Oral Infect & Immun Branch, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA","Weaver, CT (reprint author), Univ Alabama, Dept Pathol, Birmingham, AL 35294 USA.",cweaver@uab.edu,"O'Quinn, Darrell/B-3318-2008","Weaver, Casey/0000-0002-2180-1793",,,,26,1960,2099,3,78,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,11-May,2006,441,7090,,,,,231,234,,10.1038/nature04754,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,040YP,WOS:000237418800049,16648837,No,,,11/20/17

T-helper (T-H) cells are traditionally thought to differentiate into T(H)1 and T(H)2 cell subsets. T(H)1 cells are necessary to clear intracellular pathogens and T(H)2 cells are important for clearing extracellular organisms(1,2). Recently, a subset of interleukin ( IL)-17-producing T (T(H)17) cells distinct from T(H)1 or T(H)2 cells has been described and shown to have a crucial role in the induction of autoimmune tissue injury(3-5). In contrast, CD4(+) CD25(+) Foxp3(+) regulatory T (T-reg) cells inhibit autoimmunity and protect against tissue injury(6). Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) is a critical differentiation factor for the generation of T-reg cells(7). Here we show, using mice with a reporter introduced into the endogenous Foxp3 locus, that IL-6, an acute phase protein induced during inflammation(8,9), completely inhibits the generation of Foxp3(+) T-reg cells induced by TGF-beta. We also demonstrate that IL-23 is not the differentiation factor for the generation of T(H)17 cells. Instead, IL-6 and TGF-beta together induce the differentiation of pathogenic T(H)17 cells from naive T cells. Our data demonstrate a dichotomy in the generation of pathogenic (T(H)17) T cells that induce autoimmunity and regulatory (Foxp3(+)) T cells that inhibit autoimmune tissue injury.","Brigham & Womens Hosp, Ctr Neurol Dis, Boston, MA 02115 USA; Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Beth Israel Hosp, Transplant Res Ctr, Boston, MA 02115 USA; Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Brigham & Womens Hosp, Ctr Neurol Dis, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA","Kuchroo, VK (reprint author), Brigham & Womens Hosp, Ctr Neurol Dis, 77 Ave Louis Pasteur, Boston, MA 02115 USA.",moukka@rics.bwh.harvard.edu; vkuchroo@rics.bwh.harvard.edu,,"Korn, Thomas/0000-0002-3633-0955",,,,23,3555,3864,14,248,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,11-May,2006,441,7090,,,,,235,238,,10.1038/nature04753,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,040YP,WOS:000237418800050,16648838,No,,,11/20/17

Such immune evasion tactics have not previously been intentionally applied to the development of novel viral gene delivery vectors that overcome the critical problem of anti-vector immunity. Recombinant, replication-incompetent adenovirus serotype 5 (rAd5) vector-based vaccines for human immunodeficiency virus type 1 and other pathogens have proved highly immunogenic in preclinical studies(1,2) but will probably be limited by the high prevalence of pre-existing anti-Ad5 immunity in human populations, particularly in the developing world(3-6). Here we show that rAd5 vectors can be engineered to circumvent anti-Ad5 immunity. We constructed novel chimaeric rAd5 vectors in which the seven short hypervariable regions (HVRs) on the surface of the Ad5 hexon protein were replaced with the corresponding HVRs from the rare adenovirus serotype Ad48. These HVR-chimaeric rAd5 vectors were produced at high titres and were stable through serial passages in vitro. HVR-chimaeric rAd5 vectors expressing simian immunodeficiency virus Gag proved comparably immunogenic to parental rAd5 vectors in naive mice and rhesus monkeys. In the presence of high levels of pre-existing anti-Ad5 immunity, the immunogenicity of HVR-chimaeric rAd5 vectors was not detectably suppressed, whereas the immunogenicity of parental rAd5 vectors was abrogated. These data demonstrate that functionally relevant Ad5-specific neutralizing antibodies are focused on epitopes located within the hexon HVRs. Moreover, these studies show that recombinant viral vectors can be engineered to circumvent pre-existing anti-vector immunity by removing key neutralizing epitopes on the surface of viral capsid proteins. Such chimaeric viral vectors may have important practical implications for vaccination and gene therapy.","Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Beth Israel Deaconess Med Ctr, Div Viral Pathogenesis, Boston, MA 02215 USA; Crucell Holland BV, NL-2301 CA Leiden, Netherlands; Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Childrens Hosp, Mol Med Lab, Boston, MA 02115 USA; S African MRC, ZA-4001 Durban, South Africa; New England Reg Primate Res Ctr, Southborough, MA 01772 USA","Barouch, DH (reprint author), Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Beth Israel Deaconess Med Ctr, Div Viral Pathogenesis, Boston, MA 02215 USA.",dbarouch@bidmc.harvard.edu,,,,,,22,284,292,0,11,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,11-May,2006,441,7090,,,,,239,243,,10.1038/nature04721,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,040YP,WOS:000237418800051,16625206,No,,,11/20/17

However, in programmed -1 ribosomal frameshifting(2), a specific subversion of frame maintenance takes place, wherein the ribosome is forced to shift one nucleotide backwards into an overlapping reading frame and to translate an entirely new sequence of amino acids. This process is indispensable in the replication of numerous viral pathogens, including HIV and the coronavirus associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome(3), and is also exploited in the expression of several cellular genes(4). Frameshifting is promoted by an mRNA signal composed of two essential elements: a heptanucleotide 'slippery' sequence(5) and an adjacent mRNA secondary structure, most often an mRNA pseudoknot(6). How these components operate together to manipulate the ribosome is unknown. Here we describe the observation of a ribosome - mRNA pseudoknot complex that is stalled in the process of -1 frameshifting. Cryoelectron microscopic imaging of purified mammalian 80S ribosomes from rabbit reticulocytes paused at a coronavirus pseudoknot reveals an intermediate of the frameshifting process. From this it can be seen how the pseudoknot interacts with the ribosome to block the mRNA entrance channel, compromising the translocation process and leading to a spring-like deformation of the P-site transfer RNA. In addition, we identify movements of the likely eukaryotic ribosomal helicase and confirm a direct interaction between the translocase eEF2 and the P-site tRNA. Together, the structural changes provide a mechanical explanation of how the pseudoknot manipulates the ribosome into a different reading frame.","Univ Cambridge, Dept Pathol, Div Virol, Cambridge CB2 1QP, England; Univ Oxford, Div Struct Biol, Oxford OX3 7BN, England; Univ Oxford, Cent Chem Lab, Oxford Ctr Mol Sci, Oxford OX1 3QH, England","Brierley, I (reprint author), Univ Cambridge, Dept Pathol, Div Virol, Tennis Court Rd, Cambridge CB2 1QP, England.",gilbert@strubi.ox.ac.uk; ib103@mole.bio.cam.ac.uk,"Namy, olivier/B-8906-2008","Namy, Olivier/0000-0002-1143-5961","Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council [BB/D013305/1, BB/D009499/1]; Medical Research Council [G0500365]; Wellcome Trust",,,29,155,158,1,15,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,11-May,2006,441,7090,,,,,244,247,,10.1038/nature04735,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,040YP,WOS:000237418800052,16688178,No,,,11/20/17

In animal mitotic cells, phosphorylation of cohesin promotes its dissociation from chromosomes, but centromeric cohesin is protected by shugoshin until kinetochores are properly captured by the spindle microtubules. However, the mechanism of shugoshin-dependent protection of cohesin is unknown. Here we find a specific subtype of serine/threonine protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) associating with human shugoshin. PP2A colocalizes with shugoshin at centromeres and is required for centromeric protection. Purified shugoshin complex has an ability to reverse the phosphorylation of cohesin in vitro, suggesting that dephosphorylation of cohesin is the mechanism of protection at centromeres. Meiotic shugoshin of fission yeast also associates with PP2A, with both proteins collaboratively protecting Rec8-containing cohesin at centromeres.

Destruction of sister chromatid cohesion along chromosome arms due to proteolytic cleavage of cohesin's Rec8 subunit by separase resolves chiasmata and thereby triggers the first meiotic division. This produces univalent chromosomes, the chromatids of which are held together by centromeric cohesin that has been protected from separase by shugoshin (Sgo1/MEI-S332) proteins. Here we show in both fission and budding yeast that Sgo1 recruits to centromeres a specific form of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A). Its inactivation causes loss of centromeric cohesin at anaphase I and random segregation of sister centromeres at the second meiotic division. Artificial recruitment of PP2A to chromosome arms prevents Rec8 phosphorylation and hinders resolution of chiasmata.

Radio emissions, thought to provide a proxy measure of the rotation of the magnetic field, have yielded estimates of the rotation period between 10 h 39 min 22 s and 10 h 45 min 45 s (refs 8-10). Because the period determined from radio measurements exhibits large time variations, even on time-scales of months, it has been uncertain whether the radio-emission periodicity coincides with the inner rotation rate of the planet. Here we report magnetic field measurements that revealed a time-stationary magnetic signal with a period of 10 h 47 min 6 s +/-40 s.

In contrast, the low-temperature behaviour of 'metallic' polymers has, in all previous cases, exhibited an increase in resistivity as temperature is further decreased, as a result of disorder-induced localization of the charge carriers(1-4). This disorder-induced localization also changes the infrared response such that sigma(omega) deviates from the prediction of Drude theory(5-7).

With polyaniline samples prepared using self-stabilized dispersion polymerization(8), we find that for samples having room-temperature conductivities in excess of 1,000 S cm(-1), the resistivity decreases monotonically as the temperature is lowered down to 5 K, and that the infrared spectra are characteristic of the conventional Drude model even at the lowest frequencies measured.","Pusan Natl Univ, Dept Phys, Pusan 609735, South Korea; Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Ctr Polymers & Organ Solids, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; Ajou Univ, Dept Mol Sci & Technol, Suwon 442749, South Korea","Lee, K (reprint author), Pusan Natl Univ, Dept Phys, Pusan 609735, South Korea.",kwhlee@pusan.ac.kr; hyja@ajou.ac.kr,"Cho, Shinuk/B-9530-2008","Cho, Shinuk/0000-0002-6855-833X",,,,27,521,531,18,213,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,4-May,2006,441,7089,,,,,65,68,,10.1038/nature04705,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,038TB,WOS:000237248600032,16672965,No,,,11/20/17

Discrete tunnel junctions, or molecular diodes, have been reported using scanning probes(11,12), break junctions(13,14), metallic crossbars(6) and nanopores(8,15). For technological applications, molecular tunnel junctions must be reliable, stable and reproducible. The conductance per molecule, however, typically varies by many orders of magnitude(5). Self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) may offer a promising route to the fabrication of reliable devices, and charge transport through SAMs of alkanethiols within nanopores is well understood, with non-resonant tunnelling dominating the transport mechanism(8). Unfortunately, electrical shorts in SAMs are often formed upon vapour deposition of the top electrode(16-18), which limits the diameter of the nanopore diodes to about 45 nm. Here we demonstrate a method to manufacture molecular junctions with diameters up to 100 mu m with high yields (>95 per cent). The junctions show excellent stability and reproducibility, and the conductance per unit area is similar to that obtained for benchmark nanopore diodes.

Simple theories suggest that global warming will reduce the strength of the mean tropical atmospheric circulation(4,5). An important aspect of this tropical circulation is a large-scale zonal (east-west) overturning of air across the equatorial Pacific Ocean-driven by convection to the west and subsidence to the east-known as the Walker circulation(6). Here we explore changes in tropical Pacific circulation since the mid-nineteenth century using observations and a suite of global climate model experiments. Observed Indo-Pacific sea level pressure reveals a weakening of the Walker circulation. The size of this trend is consistent with theoretical predictions, is accurately reproduced by climate model simulations and, within the climate models, is largely due to anthropogenic forcing. The climate model indicates that the weakened surface winds have altered the thermal structure and circulation of the tropical Pacific Ocean. These results support model projections of further weakening of tropical atmospheric circulation during the twenty-first century(4,5,7).","NOAA, Geophys Fluid Dynam Lab, Princeton, NJ 08540 USA; Univ Miami, Rosenstiel Sch Marine & Atmospher Sci, Miami, FL 33149 USA","Vecchi, GA (reprint author), NOAA, Geophys Fluid Dynam Lab, Princeton, NJ 08540 USA.",Gabriel.A.Vecchi@noaa.gov,"Vecchi, Gabriel/A-2413-2008; Wittenberg, Andrew/G-9619-2013","Vecchi, Gabriel/0000-0002-5085-224X; Wittenberg, Andrew/0000-0003-1680-8963",,,,30,495,514,5,125,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,4-May,2006,441,7089,,,,,73,76,,10.1038/nature04744,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,038TB,WOS:000237248600034,16672967,No,,,11/20/17

Despite features found in basal actinopterygians (for example, Dialipina and Ligulalepis)(1-3) and basal sarcopterygians (for example, Psarolepis and Achoania)(4,5), the morphological gap between the two lineages remains wide and how sarcopterygians developed a dermal surface covering known as cosmine (composed of a pore-canal network and a single layer of odontodes and enamel) is still poorly known(6-10). Here we describe a primitive fossil fish, Meemannia eos gen. et sp. nov., that possesses an actinopterygian-like skull roof and a cosmine-like dermal surface combining a pore-canal network (found in various fossil sarcopterygians) with superimposed layers of odontodes and enamel (previously known in actinopterygians and some acanthodians(11-13)). This 405-million-year-old fish from the Lower Devonian of Yunnan (China) demonstrates that cosmine in many fossil sarcopterygians arose step by step through the acquisition of a pore-canal network followed by the subsequently developed ability to resorb previous generations of odontodes and enamel. Meemannia provides key characters for studying deep osteichthyan phylogeny and indicates a possible morphotype for the common ancestor of actinopterygians and sarcopterygians.","Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Vertebrate Paleontol & Paleoanthropol, Beijing 100044, Peoples R China; Kean Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Union, NJ 07083 USA","Zhu, M (reprint author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Vertebrate Paleontol & Paleoanthropol, POB 643, Beijing 100044, Peoples R China.",zhumin@ivpp.ac.cn,"Yu, Xiaobo/G-7160-2011; Zhu, Min/E-8728-2012","Zhu, Min/0000-0002-4786-0898; Yu, Xiaobo/0000-0001-9600-7888",,,,30,52,54,0,14,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,4-May,2006,441,7089,,,,,77,80,,10.1038/nature04563,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,038TB,WOS:000237248600035,16672968,No,,,11/20/17

Here we investigate the population consequences of such mistiming in the migratory pied flycatcher, Ficedula hypoleuca(4). In a comparison of nine Dutch populations, we find that populations have declined by about 90% over the past two decades in areas where the food for provisioning nestlings peaks early in the season and the birds are currently mistimed. In areas with a late food peak, early-breeding birds still breed at the right time, and there is, at most, a weak population decline. If food phenology advances further, we also predict population declines in areas with a late food peak, as in these areas adjustment to an advanced food peak is insufficient(4). Mistiming as a result of climate change is probably a widespread phenomenon(1), and here we provide evidence that it can lead to population declines.","NIOO KNAW, Netherlands Inst Ecol, NL-6666 ZG Heteren, Netherlands; Univ Groningen, Anim Ecol Grp, Ctr Ecol & Evolut Studies, NL-9750 AA Haren, Netherlands","Both, C (reprint author), NIOO KNAW, Netherlands Inst Ecol, POB 40, NL-6666 ZG Heteren, Netherlands.",C.Both@rug.nl,"Visser, Marcel/A-9151-2009; Lessells, C.M./B-3891-2011; Both, Christiaan/E-6459-2011; Bouwhuis, Sandra/H-5270-2011","Visser, Marcel/0000-0002-1456-1939; Lessells, C.M./0000-0002-7004-1954; Bouwhuis, Sandra/0000-0003-4023-1578; van der Heijden, Marianne/0000-0002-0795-3619",,,,28,628,667,35,539,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,4-May,2006,441,7089,,,,,81,83,,10.1038/nature04539,,3,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,038TB,WOS:000237248600036,16672969,No,,,11/20/17

To date, empirical studies have provided support for parts of this scenario(1), but evidence for all key genetic components in a natural population is lacking. Here we use animal-model quantitative genetic analysis(2,3) on data from over 8,500 collared flycatchers (Ficedula albicollis) followed for 24 years to quantify all of the key genetic requirements of both fisherian(4,5) and 'good-genes' models(6,7) on sexual selection in the wild. We found significant additive genetic variances of all the main components: male ornament (forehead patch size), female mate choice for this ornament, male fitness and female fitness. However, when the necessary genetic correlations between these components were taken into account, the estimated strength of indirect sexual selection on female mate choice was negligible. Our results show that the combined effect of environmental influences on several components reduces the potential for indirect sexual selection in the wild. This study provides insight into the field of sexual selection by showing that genes coding for mate choice for an ornament probably evolve by their own pathways instead of 'hitchhiking' with genes coding for the ornament.","Uppsala Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolut, SE-75236 Uppsala, Sweden; Univ Helsinki, Bird Ecol Unit, Dept Biol & Environm Sci, FI-00014 Helsinki, Finland","Qvarnstrom, A (reprint author), Uppsala Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolut, Norbyvagen 18D, SE-75236 Uppsala, Sweden.",,"Brommer, Jon/C-3613-2008; Gustafsson, Lars/A-7634-2012","Brommer, Jon/0000-0002-2435-2612; Gustafsson, Lars/0000-0001-6566-2863; Qvarnstrom, Anna/0000-0002-1178-4053",,,,30,147,148,0,74,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,4-May,2006,441,7089,,,,,84,86,,10.1038/nature04564,,3,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,038TB,WOS:000237248600037,16672970,No,,,11/20/17

Many thousands more are predicted on the basis of comparative genomics(2,3). However, in stark contrast to the genes that they regulate, in invertebrates virtually none of these regions can be traced by using sequence similarity, leaving their evolutionary origins obscure. Here we show that a class of conserved, primarily non-coding regions in tetrapods originated from a previously unknown short interspersed repetitive element (SINE) retroposon family that was active in the Sarcopterygii (lobe-finned fishes and terrestrial vertebrates) in the Silurian period at least 410 million years ago (ref. 4), and seems to be recently active in the 'living fossil' Indonesian coelacanth, Latimeria menadoensis. Using a mouse enhancer assay we show that one copy, 0.5 million bases from the neuro-developmental gene ISL1, is an enhancer that recapitulates multiple aspects of Isl1 expression patterns. Several other copies represent new, possibly regulatory, alternatively spliced exons in the middle of pre-existing Sarcopterygian genes. One of these, a more than 200-base-pair ultraconserved region(5), 100% identical in mammals, and 80% identical to the coelacanth SINE, contains a 31-amino-acid-residue alternatively spliced exon of the messenger RNA processing gene PCBP2 (ref. 6). These add to a growing list of examples(7) in which relics of transposable elements have acquired a function that serves their host, a process termed 'exaptation'(8), and provide an origin for at least some of the many highly conserved vertebrate-specific genomic sequences.","Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Ctr Biomol Sci & Engn, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA; DOE Joint Genome Inst, Walnut Creek, CA 94598 USA; Univ Calif Berkeley, Lawrence Berkeley Lab, Genom Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA","Bejerano, G (reprint author), Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Ctr Biomol Sci & Engn, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA.",jill@soe.ucsc.edu,,"Ahituv, Nadav/0000-0002-7434-8144; Siepel, Adam/0000-0002-3557-7219",,,,30,306,312,2,34,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,4-May,2006,441,7089,,,,,87,90,,10.1038/nature04696,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,038TB,WOS:000237248600038,16625209,No,,,11/20/17

However, a major bottleneck in generating useful small-molecule tools is target identification. Here we show that Caenorhabditis elegans can provide a platform for both the discovery of new bioactive compounds and target identification. We screened 14,100 small molecules for bioactivity in wild-type worms and identified 308 compounds that induce a variety of phenotypes. One compound that we named nemadipine-A induces marked defects in morphology and egg-laying. Nemadipine-A resembles a class of widely prescribed anti-hypertension drugs called the 1,4-dihydropyridines (DHPs) that antagonize the alpha(1)-subunit of L-type calcium channels(2,3). Through a genetic suppressor screen, we identified egl-19 as the sole candidate target of nemadipine-A, a conclusion that is supported by several additional lines of evidence. egl-19 encodes the only L-type calcium channel alpha(1)-subunit in the C. elegans genome(4,5). We show that nemadipine-A can also antagonize vertebrate L-type calcium channels, demonstrating that worms and vertebrates share the orthologous protein target. Conversely, FDA-approved DHPs fail to elicit robust phenotypes, making nemadipine-A a unique tool to screen for genetic interactions with this important class of drugs. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of nemadipine- A by using it to reveal redundancy among three calcium channels in the egg-laying circuit.

BRs bind to the plasma membrane receptor kinase BRI1, and act through a signalling pathway that involves a glycogen synthase kinase-3-like kinase (BIN2) and a serine/threonine phosphatase (BSU1)(3-5). Previous models proposed that BIN2 negatively regulates BR signalling by controlling the stability and subcellular localization of the related transcription factors BES1 and BZR1 by phosphorylation, in a manner reminiscent of the canonical Wnt signalling pathway of metazoans(6-9). Here we present strong evidence for a different mode of regulation of BR signalling. We show that BES1 is localized constitutively to the nucleus, where its activity is modulated by nuclear-localized BIN2 kinase. BIN2-mediated phosphorylation of BES1 inhibits its DNA-binding activity on BR-responsive target promoters and its transcriptional activity through impaired multimerization. Our observations demonstrate that phosphorylation-dependent inhibition of DNA binding and trans-activation is the key primary mechanism of BES1 regulation.","Salk Inst Biol Studies, Plant Biol Lab, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; Salk Inst Biol Studies, Howard Hughes Med Inst, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA","Chory, J (reprint author), Salk Inst Biol Studies, Plant Biol Lab, 10010 N Torrey Pines Rd, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA.",chory@salk.edu,,"Vert, Greg/0000-0002-0844-9991",,,,27,180,193,4,34,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,4-May,2006,441,7089,,,,,96,100,,10.1038/nature04681,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,038TB,WOS:000237248600040,16672972,No,,,11/20/17

In vitro studies suggest that both RIG-I and MDA5 detect RNA viruses and polyinosine-polycytidylic acid (poly(I:C)), a synthetic dsRNA analogue(3). Although a critical role for RIG-I in the recognition of several RNA viruses has been clarified(8), the functional role of MDA5 and the relationship between these dsRNA detectors in vivo are yet to be determined. Here we use mice deficient in MDA5 (MDA5(-/-)) to show that MDA5 and RIG-I recognize different types of dsRNAs: MDA5 recognizes poly(I:C), and RIG-I detects in vitro transcribed dsRNAs. RNA viruses are also differentially recognized by RIG-I and MDA5. We find that RIG-I is essential for the production of interferons in response to RNA viruses including paramyxo-viruses, influenza virus and Japanese encephalitis virus, whereas MDA5 is critical for picornavirus detection. Furthermore, RIG-I-/- and MDA5(-/-) mice are highly susceptible to infection with these respective RNA viruses compared to control mice.

Hallmarks of cancer include self-sufficiency in growth signals and evasion from apoptosis(1); genes that regulate these processes may be optimal for therapeutic attack. Here we describe a loss-of-function screen for genes required for the proliferation and survival of cancer cells using an RNA interference library. We used a doxycycline-inducible retroviral vector for the expression of small hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) to construct a library targeting 2,500 human genes. We used retroviral pools from this library to infect cell lines representing two distinct molecular subgroups of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), termed activated B-cell-like DLBCL and germinal centre B-cell-like DLBCL. Each vector was engineered to contain a unique 60-base-pair 'bar code', allowing the abundance of an individual shRNA vector within a population of transduced cells to be measured using microarrays of the bar-code sequences. We observed that a subset of shRNA vectors was depleted from the transduced cells after three weeks in culture only if shRNA expression was induced. In activated B-cell-like DLBCL cells, but not germinal centre B-cell-like DLBCL cells, shRNAs targeting the NF-kappa B pathway were depleted, in keeping with the essential role of this pathway in the survival of activated B-cell-like DLBCL. This screen uncovered CARD11 as a key upstream signalling component responsible for the constitutive I kappa B kinase activity in activated B-cell-like DLBCL.

A single siRNA injection resulted in dose-dependent silencing of APOB messenger RNA expression in the liver 48 h after administration, with maximal silencing of >90%. This silencing effect occurred as a result of APOB mRNA cleavage at precisely the site predicted for the RNAi mechanism. Significant reductions in ApoB protein, serum cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein levels were observed as early as 24 h after treatment and lasted for 11 days at the highest siRNA dose, thus demonstrating an immediate, potent and lasting biological effect of siRNA treatment. Our findings show clinically relevant RNAi-mediated gene silencing in non-human primates, supporting RNAi therapeutics as a potential new class of drugs.","Alnylam Pharmaceut Inc, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; Protiva Biotherapeut Inc, Burnaby, BC V5G 4Y1, Canada; Alnylam Europe AG, D-95326 Kulmbach, Germany","Zimmermann, TS (reprint author), Alnylam Pharmaceut Inc, 300 3rd St, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA.",tzimmermann@alnylam.com; ian@protivabio.com,,,,,,19,893,939,8,118,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,4-May,2006,441,7089,,,,,111,114,,10.1038/nature04688,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,038TB,WOS:000237248600043,16565705,No,,,11/20/17

One regulatory mechanism is the depolymerization of microtubules by motor proteins in the kinesin-13 family(1). These proteins are crucial for the control of microtubule length in cell division(2-4), neuronal development(5) and interphase microtubule dynamics(6,7). The mechanism by which kinesin-13 proteins depolymerize microtubules is poorly understood. A central question is how these proteins target to microtubule ends at rates exceeding those of standard enzyme-substrate kinetics(8). To address this question we developed a single-molecule microscopy assay for MCAK, the founding member of the kinesin-13 family(9). Here we show that MCAK moves along the microtubule lattice in a one-dimensional (1D) random walk. MCAK-microtubule interactions were transient: the average MCAK molecule diffused for 0.83 s with a diffusion coefficient of 0.38 mu m(2) s(-1). Although the catalytic depolymerization by MCAK requires the hydrolysis of ATP, we found that the diffusion did not. The transient transition from three-dimensional diffusion to 1D diffusion corresponds to a ""reduction in dimensionality""(10) that has been proposed as the search strategy by which DNA enzymes find specific binding sites(11). We show that MCAK uses this strategy to target to both microtubule ends more rapidly than direct binding from solution.","Max Planck Inst Mol Cell Biol & Genet, D-01307 Dresden, Germany; Moscow MV Lomonosov State Univ, AN Belozersky Inst Physicochem Biol, Moscow 119899, Russia","Howard, J (reprint author), Max Planck Inst Mol Cell Biol & Genet, D-01307 Dresden, Germany.",howard@mpi-cbg.de,"Howard, Jonathon /D-4229-2011; Diez, Stefan/E-8172-2010; Kalaidzidis, Yannis/H-3094-2016; Howard, Jonathon/J-7492-2016","Howard, Jonathon /0000-0003-0086-1196; Diez, Stefan/0000-0002-0750-8515; Kalaidzidis, Yannis/0000-0002-6137-1193; Howard, Jonathon/0000-0003-0086-1196",,,,30,261,270,3,42,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,4-May,2006,441,7089,,,,,115,119,,10.1038/nature04736,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,038TB,WOS:000237248600044,16672973,No,,,11/20/17

The efficiency with which bacteria incorporate genetic information reflects their capacity to adapt to changing environmental conditions. Integron integrases are proteins that mediate site-specific DNA recombination between a proximal primary site (attI) and a secondary target site (attC) found within mobile gene cassettes encoding resistance or virulence factors. The lack of sequence conservation among attC sites has led to the hypothesis that a sequence-independent structural recognition determinant must exist within attC. Here we report the crystal structure of an integron integrase bound to an attC substrate. The structure shows that DNA target site recognition and high-order synaptic assembly are not dependent on canonical DNA but on the position of two flipped-out bases that interact in cis and in trans with the integrase. These extrahelical bases, one of which is required for recombination in vivo, originate from folding of the bottom strand of attC owing to its imperfect internal dyad symmetry. The mechanism reported here supports a new paradigm for how sequence-degenerate single-stranded genetic material is recognized and exchanged between bacteria.","Inst Pasteur, Dept Biol Struct & Chim, Lab Biochim & Biophys Macromol, F-75724 Paris 15, France; Inst Pasteur, CNRS,URA 2171, Dept Struct & Dynam Genomes, Unite Postulante Plast Genome Bacterien, F-75724 Paris, France","Gopaul, DN (reprint author), Inst Pasteur, Dept Biol Struct & Chim, Lab Biochim & Biophys Macromol, F-75724 Paris 15, France.",gopauld@pasteur.fr,"Mazel, Didier/F-9200-2013","Mazel, Didier/0000-0001-6482-6002; GOPAUL, Deshmukh/0000-0003-1631-3303; Bouvier, Marie/0000-0002-2111-052X",,,,40,91,105,0,10,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,27-Apr,2006,440,7088,,,,,1157,1162,,10.1038/nature04643,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,036OG,WOS:000237080000037,16641988,No,,,11/20/17

A problem with this mechanism, however, is that the orbital planes of regular satellites would probably be uncorrelated with the obliquities, contrary to observations(6,7). Alternatively, they could have come from an external twist that affected the orientation of the Solar System plane(2); but in this model, the outer planets must have formed too rapidly, before the event that produced the twist(8). Moreover, the model cannot be quantitatively tested. Here I show that the present obliquities of the giant planets were probably achieved when Jupiter and Saturn crossed the 1:2 orbital resonance(9) during a specific migration process: different migration scenarios cannot account for the large observed obliquities. The existence of the regular satellites of the giant planets does not represent a problem in this model because, although they formed soon after the planetary formation, they can follow the slow evolution of the equatorial plane it produces.","Natl Univ La Plata, Fac Ciencias Astron & Geofis, RA-1900 La Plata, Argentina; Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn, Inst Astrofis La Plata, RA-1900 La Plata, Argentina","Brunini, A (reprint author), Natl Univ La Plata, Fac Ciencias Astron & Geofis, Paseo Bosque S-N, RA-1900 La Plata, Argentina.",abrunini@fcaglp.unlp.edu.ar,,,,,,23,7,7,0,6,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,27-Apr,2006,440,7088,,,,,1163,1165,,10.1038/nature04577,,3,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,036OG,WOS:000237080000038,16641989,No,,,11/20/17

The lack of periodicity excludes the possibility of describing quasicrystal structures with well-established analytical tools, including common notions like Brillouin zones and Bloch's theorem. New and unique features such as fractal-like band structures(4-7) and 'phason' degrees of freedom(8) are introduced. In general, it is very difficult to directly observe the evolution of electronic waves in solid-state atomic quasicrystals, or the dynamics of the structure itself. Here we use optical induction(9-11) to create two-dimensional photonic quasicrystals, whose macroscopic nature allows us to explore wave transport phenomena. We demonstrate that light launched at different quasicrystal sites travels through the lattice in a way equivalent to quantum tunnelling of electrons in a quasiperiodic potential. At high intensity, lattice solitons are formed. Finally, we directly observe dislocation dynamics when crystal sites are allowed to interact with each other. Our experimental results apply not only to photonics, but also to other quasiperiodic systems such as matter waves in quasiperiodic traps(12), generic pattern-forming systems as in parametrically excited surface waves(13), liquid quasicrystals(14), and the more familiar atomic quasicrystals.","Technion Israel Inst Technol, Dept Phys, IL-32000 Haifa, Israel; Technion Israel Inst Technol, Inst Solid State, IL-32000 Haifa, Israel; Tel Aviv Univ, Sch Phys & Astron, IL-69978 Tel Aviv, Israel; Univ Cent Florida, Coll Opt & Photon, Orlando, FL 32816 USA; Princeton Univ, Princeton Inst Sci & Technol Mat, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; Princeton Univ, Dept Elect Engn, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA","Segev, M (reprint author), Technion Israel Inst Technol, Dept Phys, IL-32000 Haifa, Israel.",msegev@techunix.technion.ac.il,"Lifshitz, Ron/A-7775-2008","Lifshitz, Ron/0000-0002-8829-5506",,,,30,164,166,6,63,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,27-Apr,2006,440,7088,,,,,1166,1169,,10.1038/nature04722,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,036OG,WOS:000237080000039,16641990,No,,,11/20/17

Many believe that antiferromagnetism is important for superconductivity, but there has been renewed interest in the possible role of electron-lattice coupling(1-4). The conventional superconductor MgB2 has a very strong electron-lattice coupling, involving a particular vibrational mode (phonon) that was predicted by standard theory and confirmed quantitatively by experiment(5). Here we present inelastic scattering measurements that show a similarly strong anomaly in the Cu-O bond-stretching phonon in the copper oxide superconductors La2-xSrxCuO4 (with x=0.07, 0.15). Conventional theory does not predict such behaviour. The anomaly is strongest in La1.875Ba0.125CuO4 and La1.48Nd0.4Sr0.12CuO4, compounds that exhibit spatially modulated charge and magnetic order, often called stripe order(6); it occurs at a wave vector corresponding to the charge order. These results suggest that this giant electron-phonon anomaly, which is absent in undoped and over-doped non-superconductors, is associated with charge inhomogeneity. It follows that electron-phonon coupling may be important to our understanding of superconductivity, although its contribution is likely to be indirect.","Forschungszentrum Karlsruhe, Inst Festkorperphys, D-76021 Karlsruhe, Germany; Ctr Etud Saclay, Leon Brillouin Lab, F-91191 Gif Sur Yvette, France; Nagoya Univ, Dept Phys, Div Sci Mat, Chikusa Ku, Nagoya, Aichi 4648602, Japan; Tohoku Univ, Inst Mat Res, Aoba Ku, Sendai, Miyagi 9808577, Japan; Brookhaven Natl Lab, Condensed Matter Phys & Mat Sci, Upton, NY 11973 USA","Reznik, D (reprint author), Forschungszentrum Karlsruhe, Inst Festkorperphys, POB 3640, D-76021 Karlsruhe, Germany.",Reznik@llb.saclay.cea.fr,"Tranquada, John/A-9832-2009; Yamada, Kazuyoshi/C-2728-2009; Gu, Genda/D-5410-2013; Fujita, Masaki/D-8430-2013","Tranquada, John/0000-0003-4984-8857; Gu, Genda/0000-0002-9886-3255; ",,,,30,205,206,3,47,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,27-Apr,2006,440,7088,,,,,1170,1173,,10.1038/nature04704,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,036OG,WOS:000237080000040,16641991,No,,,11/20/17

First proposed theoretically in 1934 (refs 1-3) to explain low magnitudes of crystal strength observed experimentally, the existence of dislocations was confirmed two decades later(4,5). Much of the research in dislocation physics has since focused on dislocation interactions and their role in strain hardening, a common phenomenon in which continued deformation increases a crystal's strength. The existing theory relates strain hardening to pair-wise dislocation reactions in which two intersecting dislocations form junctions that tie the dislocations together(6,7). Here we report that interactions among three dislocations result in the formation of unusual elements of dislocation network topology, termed 'multi-junctions'. We first predict the existence of multi-junctions using dislocation dynamics and atomistic simulations and then confirm their existence by transmission electron microscopy experiments in single-crystal molybdenum. In large-scale dislocation dynamics simulations, multi-junctions present very strong, nearly indestructible, obstacles to dislocation motion and furnish new sources for dislocation multiplication, thereby playing an essential role in the evolution of dislocation microstructure and strength of deforming crystals(8). Simulation analyses conclude that multi-junctions are responsible for the strong orientation dependence of strain hardening in body-centred cubic crystals.","Lawrence Livermore Natl Lab, Livermore, CA 94550 USA; Stanford Univ, Dept Mech Engn, Stanford, CA 94305 USA","Bulatov, VV (reprint author), Lawrence Livermore Natl Lab, Livermore, CA 94550 USA.",bulatov1@llnl.gov,,"Cai, Wei/0000-0001-5919-8734",,,,20,130,132,6,85,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,27-Apr,2006,440,7088,,,,,1174,1178,,10.1038/nature04658,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,036OG,WOS:000237080000041,16641992,No,,,11/20/17

Despite the co-variability of both of these climate variables(3), attention in long-term climate reconstruction has mainly concentrated on temperature changes(4-8). Here we present an annually resolved oxygen isotope record from tree-rings, providing a millennial-scale reconstruction of precipitation variability in the high mountains of northern Pakistan. The climatic signal originates mainly from winter precipitation, and is robust over ecologically different sites. Centennial-scale variations reveal dry conditions at the beginning of the past millennium and through the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, with precipitation increasing during the late nineteenth and the twentieth centuries to yield the wettest conditions of the past 1,000 years.

Here we report the first direct evidence for the position of the gill filaments-possibly supported by gill rays-enclosed by gill pouches in a 370-million year (Myr)-old jawless vertebrate, Endeiolepis, from the Late Devonian fossil fish site of Miguasha, Quebec, Canada. This extinct jawless fish has much the same gill organization as living lampreys, although it possesses an unusually large number of gill pouches-a condition unlike that in any extant vertebrates and that raises questions about gill development(4). Endeiolepis is currently regarded as a close relative of anaspids(3), a group of 410-430-Myr-old 'ostracoderms'.

Although some corals are able to recover and to survive bleaching(7,8), the mechanisms underlying such resilience are poorly understood. Here we show that the coral host has a significant role in recovery and resilience. Bleached and recovering Montipora capitata (branching) corals met more than 100% of their daily metabolic energy requirements by markedly increasing their feeding rates and CHAR (per cent contribution of heterotrophically acquired carbon to daily animal respiration), whereas Porites compressa (branching) and Porites lobata (mounding) corals did not.

Maternal effects mediated by prenatal hormone exposure are potentially important for non-genetic inheritance of phenotypic traits related to social rank(3), and thus for shaping individual variation in behaviour and social structure. Here we show that androgen concentrations in wild female spotted hyaenas (Crocuta crocuta) are higher during late gestation in dominant females than in subordinate females. Furthermore, both male and female cubs born to mothers with high concentrations of androgens in late pregnancy exhibit higher rates of aggression and mounting behaviour than cubs born to mothers with lower androgen concentrations. Both behaviours are strongly affected in other mammals by organizational effects of androgens(4), and both have important effects on fitness in hyaenas. Therefore, our results suggest that rank-related maternal effects of prenatal androgen exposure can adaptively influence offspring phenotype in mammals, as has previously been shown to occur in birds. They also suggest an organizational mechanism for the development of female dominance and aggressiveness in spotted hyaenas, traits that may offset the costs of extreme virilization.","Michigan State Univ, Dept Zool, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; Univ Nebraska, Dept Psychol, Omaha, NE 68182 USA; Univ Nebraska, Dept Biol, Omaha, NE 68182 USA","Dloniak, SM (reprint author), Michigan State Univ, Dept Zool, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA.",dloniak@kenyaweb.co,"French, Jeffrey/F-1779-2011; Holekamp, Kay/G-6054-2010","French, Jeffrey/0000-0001-5304-1592",,,,27,90,92,1,85,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,27-Apr,2006,440,7088,,,,,1190,1193,,10.1038/nature04540,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,036OG,WOS:000237080000045,16641996,No,,,11/20/17

However, until now there has been no evidence for the pluripotency and plasticity of adult spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs), which are responsible for maintaining spermatogenesis throughout life in the male(3). Here we show the isolation of SSCs from adult mouse testis using genetic selection, with a success rate of 27%. These isolated SSCs respond to culture conditions and acquire embryonic stem cell properties. We name these cells multipotent adult germline stem cells (maGSCs). They are able to spontaneously differentiate into derivatives of the three embryonic germ layers in vitro and generate teratomas in immunodeficient mice. When injected into an early blastocyst, SSCs contribute to the development of various organs and show germline transmission. Thus, the capacity to form multipotent cells persists in adult mouse testis. Establishment of human maGSCs from testicular biopsies may allow individual cell-based therapy without the ethical and immunological problems associated with human embryonic stem cells. Furthermore, these cells may provide new opportunities to study genetic diseases in various cell lineages.","Univ Gottingen, Ctr Heart, Dept Cardiol & Pneumol, D-37075 Gottingen, Germany; Univ Gottingen, Inst Human Genet, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany; Univ Gottingen, Dept Cellular & Mol Immunol, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany","Hasenfuss, G (reprint author), Univ Gottingen, Ctr Heart, Dept Cardiol & Pneumol, Robert Koch Str 40, D-37075 Gottingen, Germany.",wengel@gwdg.de; hasenfus@med.uni-goettingen.de,"Dressel, Ralf/R-7065-2016","Dressel, Ralf/0000-0002-1651-1214; Guan, Kaomei/0000-0002-0753-3083",,,,30,570,635,2,64,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,27-Apr,2006,440,7088,,,,,1199,1203,,10.1038/nature04697,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,036OG,WOS:000237080000047,16565704,No,,,11/20/17

Linguistic theories account for this ability through the use of syntactic rules (or generative grammars) that describe the acceptable structure of utterances(2). The recursive, hierarchical embedding of language units (for example, words or phrases within shorter sentences) that is part of the ability to construct new utterances minimally requires a 'context-free' grammar(2,3) that is more complex than the 'finite-state' grammars thought sufficient to specify the structure of all non-human communication signals. Recent hypotheses make the central claim that the capacity for syntactic recursion forms the computational core of a uniquely human language faculty(4,5). Here we show that European starlings (Sturnus vulgaris) accurately recognize acoustic patterns defined by a recursive, self-embedding, context-free grammar. They are also able to classify new patterns defined by the grammar and reliably exclude agrammatical patterns. Thus, the capacity to classify sequences from recursive, centre-embedded grammars is not uniquely human. This finding opens a new range of complex syntactic processing mechanisms to physiological investigation.","Univ Chicago, Dept Organismal Biol & Anat, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; Univ Chicago, Dept Psychol, Chicago, IL 60637 USA","Gentner, TQ (reprint author), Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Psychol, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.",tgentner@ucsd.edu,"Galantucci, Bruno/E-5770-2010",,"NIDCD NIH HHS [F32 DC000389, F32 DC000389-03]",,,13,283,296,1,58,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,27-Apr,2006,440,7088,,,,,1204,1207,,10.1038/nature04675,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,036OG,WOS:000237080000048,16641998,No,,,11/20/17

Modest cleavage activity can be generated by reconstituting these four proteins in yeast and Spodoptera frugiperda (sf9) cells(12-14). However, a critical but unanswered question about the biology of the presenilin complexes is how their activity is modulated in terms of substrate specificity and/or relative activities at the gamma and epsilon sites. A corollary to this question is whether additional proteins in the presenilin complexes might subsume these putative regulatory functions. The hypothesis that additional proteins might exist in the presenilin complexes is supported by the fact that enzymatically active complexes have a mass that is much greater than predicted for a 1:1:1:1 stoichiometric complex (at least 650 kDa observed, compared with about 220 kDa predicted)(6-8). To address these questions we undertook a search for presenilin-interacting proteins that differentially affected gamma- and epsilon-site cleavage events. Here we report that TMP21, a member of the p24 cargo protein family, is a component of presenilin complexes and differentially regulates gamma-secretase cleavage without affecting epsilon-secretase activity.","Univ Toronto, Dept Med, Toronto, ON M5S 3H2, Canada; Univ Toronto, Dept Lab Med & Pathobiol, Toronto, ON M5S 3H2, Canada; Univ Toronto, Dept Med Biophys, Toronto, ON M5S 3H2, Canada; Univ Toronto, Ctr Res Neurodegenerat Dis, Toronto, ON M5S 3H2, Canada; UNSA, Equipe Labellisee FRM, Inst Pharmacol Mol & Cellulaire, CNRS,UMR6097, F-06560 Valbonne, France; Albert Einstein Coll Med, Dept Pathol, Bronx, NY 10461 USA; N Shore LIJ Inst Med Res, Litwin Zucker Res Ctr, Manhasset, NY 11030 USA; Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Pharmaceut Chem, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; Univ Hlth Sci Ctr, Proteom Core, Aurora, CO 80045 USA; Univ Hlth Network, Toronto Western Hosp, Res Inst, Dept Med,Div Neurol, Toronto, ON M5G 1Z5, Canada","St George-Hyslop, P (reprint author), Univ Toronto, Dept Med, Toronto, ON M5S 3H2, Canada.",p.hyslop@utoronto.ca,"Glista, Michael/F-2907-2011; Checler, Frederic/C-1241-2009","Checler, Frederic/0000-0003-2098-1750; Marambaud, Philippe/0000-0002-8983-1497",,,,30,210,216,0,7,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,27-Apr,2006,440,7088,,,,,1208,1212,,10.1038/nature04667,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,036OG,WOS:000237080000049,16641999,No,,,11/20/17

Conserved from bacteria to humans(1), the voltage-gated-ligand superfamily of ion channels are encoded as polypeptide chains of six transmembrane-spanning segments (S1-S6). S1-S4 functions as a self-contained voltage-sensing domain (VSD), in essence a positively charged lever that moves in response to voltage changes. The VSD 'ligand' transmits force via a linker to the S5-S6 pore domain 'receptor'(2), thereby opening or closing the channel. The ascidian VSD protein Ci-VSP gates a phosphatase activity rather than a channel pore, indicating that VSDs function independently of ion channels(3). Here we describe a mammalian VSD protein (H(V)1) that lacks a discernible pore domain but is sufficient for expression of a voltage-sensitive proton-selective ion channel activity. H(v)1 currents are activated at depolarizing voltages, sensitive to the transmembrane pH gradient, H+-selective, and Zn2+-sensitive. Mutagenesis of H(v)1 identified three arginine residues in S4 that regulate channel gating and two histidine residues that are required for extracellular inhibition of H(v)1 by Zn2+. H(v)1 is expressed in immune tissues and manifests the characteristic properties of native proton conductances (G(vH+)). In phagocytic leukocytes(4), G(vH+) are required to support the oxidative burst that underlies microbial killing by the innate immune system(4,5). The data presented here identify H(v)1 as a long-sought voltage-gated H+ channel and establish H(v)1 as the founding member of a family of mammalian VSD proteins.","Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Neurobiol, Childrens Hosp,Dept Cardiol,Howard Hughes Med Ins, Boston, MA 02115 USA","Clapham, DE (reprint author), Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Neurobiol, Childrens Hosp,Dept Cardiol,Howard Hughes Med Ins, Enders 1309,320 Longwood Ave, Boston, MA 02115 USA.",dclapham@enders.tch.harvard.edu,,,Howard Hughes Medical Institute,,,30,323,328,4,36,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,27-Apr,2006,440,7088,,,,,1213,1216,,10.1038/nature04700,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,036OG,WOS:000237080000050,16554753,No,,,11/20/17

Large infarct size increases immediate morbidity and mortality and, in survivors of the acute event, larger non-functional scars adversely affect long-term prognosis. There is thus an important unmet medical need for new cardioprotective and neuroprotective treatments. We have previously shown that human C-reactive protein (CRP), the classical acute-phase protein that binds to ligands exposed in damaged tissue and then activates complement(1), increases myocardial and cerebral infarct size in rats subjected to coronary or cerebral artery ligation, respectively(2,3). Rat CRP does not activate rat complement, whereas human CRP activates both rat and human complement(4). Administration of human CRP to rats is thus an excellent model for the actions of endogenous human CRP(2,3). Here we report the design, synthesis and efficacy of 1,6-bis(phosphocholine)-hexane as a specific small-molecule inhibitor of CRP. Five molecules of this palindromic compound are bound by two pentameric CRP molecules, crosslinking and occluding the ligand-binding B-face of CRP and blocking its functions. Administration of 1,6-bis(phosphocholine)-hexane to rats undergoing acute myocardial infarction abrogated the increase in infarct size and cardiac dysfunction produced by injection of human CRP. Therapeutic inhibition of CRP is thus a promising new approach to cardioprotection in acute myocardial infarction, and may also provide neuroprotection in stroke. Potential wider applications include other inflammatory, infective and tissue-damaging conditions characterized by increased CRP production, in which binding of CRP to exposed ligands in damaged cells may lead to complement-mediated exacerbation of tissue injury.","UCL, Royal Free & Univ Coll Med Sch, Dept Med, Ctr Amyloidosis & Acute Phase Prot, London NW3 2PF, England; Univ Cambridge, Dept Chem, Cambridge CB2 1EW, England; Univ Edinburgh, Ctr Cardiovasc Sci, Endothelial Cell & Mol Cardiol Grp, Edinburgh EH16 4TJ, Midlothian, Scotland; UCL, Royal Free & Univ Coll Med Sch, Dept Primary Care & Populat Sci, London NW3 2PF, England; Univ Southampton, Sch Biol Sci, Southampton SO16 7PX, Hants, England","Pepys, MB (reprint author), UCL, Royal Free & Univ Coll Med Sch, Dept Med, Ctr Amyloidosis & Acute Phase Prot, Rowland Hill St, London NW3 2PF, England.",m.pepys@medsch.ucl.ac.uk,"; Hawkins, Philip/C-5573-2008; Kolstoe, Simon/A-4150-2009; Wood, Stephen/B-1438-2009; Gray, Gillian/B-4058-2014; Bellotti, Vittorio/A-6201-2014; Aquilina, J.

Hypoxia (low oxygen) is clinically associated with metastasis and poor patient outcome, although the underlying processes remain unclear(2). Microarray studies have shown the expression of lysyl oxidase (LOX) to be elevated in hypoxic human tumour cells(3). Paradoxically, LOX expression is associated with both tumour suppression and tumour progression, and its role in tumorigenesis seems dependent on cellular location, cell type and transformation status(4-9). Here we show that LOX expression is regulated by hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) and is associated with hypoxia in human breast and head and neck tumours. Patients with high LOX-expressing tumours have poor distant metastasis-free and overall survivals. Inhibition of LOX eliminates metastasis in mice with orthotopically grown breast cancer tumours. Mechanistically, secreted LOX is responsible for the invasive properties of hypoxic human cancer cells through focal adhesion kinase activity and cell to matrix adhesion. Furthermore, LOX may be required to create a niche permissive for metastatic growth.

Kinetic(3-6) and theoretical considerations suggest that significant rate enhancement can be achieved either by reducing the dimensionality of the search process(1,7) or by the creation of a short-range attractive potential around the target site(2). This implies the existence of transient intermediates involving non-specific binding modes. Here we show that intermolecular paramagnetic relaxation enhancement (PRE) provides a means of directly detecting the presence of, and investigating the nature of, low population transient intermediates under equilibrium conditions. Applying this approach, we characterize the search process whereby a sequence-specific transcription factor (the homeodomain of HOXD9) binds to non-cognate DNA sites as a means of enhancing the rate of specific association. The PRE data in the fast exchange regime reveal the presence of transient intermediates formed in a stochastic manner at non-cognate sites whose structure is similar to that of the specific complex. Two distinct search processes involving intra- as well as intermolecular translocations can be delineated. The intermolecular PRE method is general and can be readily applied to investigations of transient intermediates in many other macromolecular binding processes.","NIDDKD, Chem Phys Lab, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA","Clore, GM (reprint author), NIDDKD, Chem Phys Lab, NIH, Bldg 2, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA.",mariusc@intra.niddk.nih.gov,"Clore, G.

Successful analysis thus depends on simplifying hypotheses, but experiments on many systems hint that complicated, higher-order interactions among large groups of elements have an important role. Here we show, in the vertebrate retina, that weak correlations between pairs of neurons coexist with strongly collective behaviour in the responses of ten or more neurons. We find that this collective behaviour is described quantitatively by models that capture the observed pairwise correlations but assume no higher-order interactions. These maximum entropy models are equivalent to Ising models, and predict that larger networks are completely dominated by correlation effects. This suggests that the neural code has associative or error-correcting properties, and we provide preliminary evidence for such behaviour. As a first test for the generality of these ideas, we show that similar results are obtained from networks of cultured cortical neurons.","Princeton Univ, Joseph Henry Labs Phys, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; Princeton Univ, Dept Mol Biol, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; Princeton Univ, Lewis Sigler Inst Integrat Genom, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA","Schneidman, E (reprint author), Princeton Univ, Joseph Henry Labs Phys, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA.",elads@princeton.edu,,"Segev, Ronen/0000-0002-8109-1076; schneidman, elad/0000-0001-8653-9848",NEI NIH HHS [R01 EY014196],,,43,671,676,4,68,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,20-Apr,2006,440,7087,,,,,1007,1012,,10.1038/nature04701,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,034DL,WOS:000236906000026,16625187,No,,,11/20/17

Direct measurements are difficult and not yet conclusive, owing to the large uncertainties caused by the bright foreground emission associated with zodiacal light(1). An alternative approach(2-5) is to study the absorption features imprinted on the gamma-ray spectra of distant extragalactic objects by interactions of those photons with the background light photons(6). Here we report the discovery of gamma-ray emission from the blazars(7) H 2356-309 and 1ES 1101-232, at redshifts z=0.165 and z=0.186, respectively. Their unexpectedly hard spectra provide an upper limit on the background light at optical/near-infrared wavelengths that appears to be very close to the lower limit given by the integrated light of resolved galaxies(8). The background flux at these wavelengths accordingly seems to be strongly dominated by the direct starlight from galaxies, thus excluding a large contribution from other sources-in particular from the first stars formed(9).

Such methods are fundamentally different from entanglement measures that, by definition, quantify the amount of entanglement in any state. However, these measures suffer from the severe disadvantage that they typically are not directly accessible in laboratory experiments. Here we report a linear optics experiment in which we directly observe a pure-state entanglement measure, namely concurrence(6).

This is the phenomenon of 'confinement', a concept at odds with the conventional theory of solids, and recognized(1) as due to magnetic and electron-lattice interactions within the layers that must be overcome at a substantial energy cost if electrons are to be transferred between layers. The associated energy gap, or 'pseudogap', is particularly obvious in experiments where charge is moved perpendicular to the planes, most notably scanning tunnelling microscopy(2) and polarized infrared spectroscopy(3). Here, using the same experimental tools, we show that there is a second family of transition-metal oxides-the layered manganites La(2-2x)Sr(1+2x)Mn(2)O(7)-with even more extreme confinement and pseudogap effects. The data demonstrate quantitatively that because the charge carriers are attached to polarons (lattice- and spin-textures within the planes), it is as difficult to remove them from the planes through vacuum-tunnelling into a conventional metallic tip, as it is for them to move between Mn-rich layers within the material itself.","UCL, London Ctr Nanotechnol, London WC1E 6BT, England; ETH, Neutron Scattering Lab, CH-5232 Villigen, Switzerland; Paul Scherrer Inst, CH-5232 Villigen, Switzerland; UCL, Dept Phys & Astron, London WC1E 6BT, England; Lucent Technol, Bell Labs, Murray Hill, NJ 07974 USA; Univ Tokyo, Dept Appl Phys, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo 1138656, Japan; Japan Sci & Technol Agcy, ERATO, Spin Superstruct Project, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3050046, Japan","Renner, C (reprint author), UCL, London Ctr Nanotechnol, Gower St, London WC1E 6BT, England.",c.renner@ucl.ac.uk,"Tokura, Yoshinori/C-7352-2009; Renner, Christoph/B-6140-2013; Ronnow, Henrik/A-4953-2009","Renner, Christoph/0000-0001-9882-681X; Ronnow, Henrik/0000-0002-8832-8865",,,,31,69,69,5,48,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,20-Apr,2006,440,7087,,,,,1025,1028,,10.1038/nature04650,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,034DL,WOS:000236906000030,16625191,No,,,11/20/17

The commonly accepted range for the equilibrium global mean temperature change in response to a doubling of the atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration(1), termed climate sensitivity, is 1.5-4.5 K (ref. 2). A number of observational studies(3-10), however, find a substantial probability of significantly higher sensitivities, yielding upper limits on climate sensitivity of 7.7 K to above 9 K (refs 3-8). Here we demonstrate that such observational estimates of climate sensitivity can be tightened if reconstructions of Northern Hemisphere temperature over the past several centuries are considered. We use large-ensemble energy balance modelling and simulate the temperature response to past solar, volcanic and greenhouse gas forcing to determine which climate sensitivities yield simulations that are in agreement with proxy reconstructions. After accounting for the uncertainty in reconstructions and estimates of past external forcing, we find an independent estimate of climate sensitivity that is very similar to those from instrumental data. If the latter are combined with the result from all proxy reconstructions, then the 5-95 per cent range shrinks to 1.5-6.2 K, thus substantially reducing the probability of very high climate sensitivity.","Duke Univ, Nicholas Sch Environm & Earth Sci, Div Earth & Ocean Sci, Durham, NC 27708 USA; Univ Oxford, Dept Phys, Climate Dynam Grp, Oxford OX1 3PU, England","Hegerl, GC (reprint author), Duke Univ, Nicholas Sch Environm & Earth Sci, Div Earth & Ocean Sci, Durham, NC 27708 USA.",hegerl@duke.edu,"Frame, Dave/A-8918-2014; Frame, Dave/R-6169-2016","Frame, Dave/0000-0002-0949-3994",,,,30,230,242,3,41,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,20-Apr,2006,440,7087,,,,,1029,1032,,10.1038/nature04679,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,034DL,WOS:000236906000031,16625192,No,,,11/20/17

Such knowledge is critical to understanding ice flow, basal water transfer to the ice margin, glacial landform development and subglacial lake habitats. Here we present ice-sheet surface elevation changes in central East Antarctica that we interpret to represent rapid discharge from a subglacial lake. Our observations indicate that during a period of 16 months, 1.8 km(3) of water was transferred over 290 km to at least two other subglacial lakes. While viscous deformation of the ice roof above may moderate discharge, the intrinsic instability of such a system(3) suggests that discharge events are a common mode of basal drainage(4). If large lakes, such as Lake Vostok or Lake Concordia(1), are pressurizing, it is possible that substantial discharges could reach the coast(5,6). Our observations conflict with expectations that subglacial lakes have long residence times and slow circulations(2,7,8), and we suggest that entire subglacial drainage basins may be flushed periodically.

Phylogenetic analysis shows that the new fossil is the most primitive (basal) snake known and that all other limbed fossil snakes are closer to the more advanced macrostomatan snakes, a group including boas, pythons and colubroids. The new fossil retains several features associated with a subterranean or surface dwelling life that are also present in primitive extant snake lineages, supporting the hypothesis of a terrestrial rather than marine origin of snakes.","Museo Argentino Ciencias Nat Bernardino Rivadavia, RA-1405 Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; Univ Maimonides, Fdn Hist Nat Felix de Azara CEBBAD, RA-1405 Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; Univ Sao Paulo, Museu Zool, BR-04263000 Sao Paulo, Brazil","Apesteguia, S (reprint author), Museo Argentino Ciencias Nat Bernardino Rivadavia, A Gallardo 470, RA-1405 Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina.",paleoninja@yahoo.com.ar; hzaher@ib.usp.br,"Zaher, Hussam/D-4000-2012; Museu de Zoologia da USP, MZ-USP/Q-2192-2016","Zaher, Hussam/0000-0002-6994-489X; ",,,,20,84,91,2,49,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,20-Apr,2006,440,7087,,,,,1037,1040,,10.1038/nature04413,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,034DL,WOS:000236906000033,16625194,No,,,11/20/17

General outlines of the answer to this puzzle are currently emerging as a result of developments in the theories of kin selection(1-7), reciprocity(8-10), multilevel selection(11-15) and cultural group selection(16,17). The main conceptual tool used in probing the logical coherence of proposed explanations has been game theory, including both analytical models and agent-based simulations(6,7,9,18-24). The game-theoretic approach yields clear-cut results but assumes, as a rule, a simple structure of payoffs and a small set of possible strategies. Here we propose a more stringent test of the theory by developing a computer model with a considerably extended spectrum of possible strategies. In our model, agents are endowed with a limited set of receptors, a set of elementary actions and a neural net in between. Behavioural strategies are not predetermined; instead, the process of evolution constructs and reconstructs them from elementary actions. Two new strategies of cooperative attack and defence emerge in simulations, as well as the well-known dove, hawk and bourgeois strategies. Our results indicate that cooperative strategies can evolve even under such minimalist assumptions, provided that agents are capable of perceiving heritable external markers of other agents.","RAS, MV Keldysh Appl Math Inst, Dept Nonlinear Dynam, Moscow 125047, Russia; Univ Connecticut, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Storrs, CT 06269 USA","Burtsev, M (reprint author), RAS, MV Keldysh Appl Math Inst, Dept Nonlinear Dynam, Moscow 125047, Russia.",mbur@narod.ru,"Burtsev, Mikhail/G-6293-2010","Burtsev, Mikhail/0000-0003-1614-1695",,,,29,29,34,4,25,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,20-Apr,2006,440,7087,,,,,1041,1044,,10.1038/nature04470,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,034DL,WOS:000236906000034,16625195,No,,,11/20/17

It is the largest human autosome with orthology to only a single mouse chromosome(1), mapping entirely to the distal half of mouse chromosome 11. Chromosome 17 is rich in protein-coding genes, having the second highest gene density in the genome(2,3). It is also enriched in segmental duplications, ranking third in density among the autosomes(4). Here we report a finished sequence for human chromosome 17, as well as a structural comparison with the finished sequence for mouse chromosome 11, the first finished mouse chromosome. Comparison of the orthologous regions reveals striking differences. In contrast to the typical pattern seen in mammalian evolution(5,6), the human sequence has undergone extensive intrachromosomal rearrangement, whereas the mouse sequence has been remarkably stable. Moreover, although the human sequence has a high density of segmental duplication, the mouse sequence has a very low density. Notably, these segmental duplications correspond closely to the sites of structural rearrangement, demonstrating a link between duplication and rearrangement. Examination of the main classes of duplicated segments provides insight into the dynamics underlying expansion of chromosome-specific, low-copy repeats in the human genome.","MIT, Broad Inst, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; Wellcome Trust Sanger Inst, Cambridge CB10 1SA, England; Baylor Coll Med, Dept Mol & Human Genet, Houston, TX 77030 USA; Childrens Hosp Oakland, Res Inst, BACPAC Resources, Oakland, CA 94609 USA; Univ Wisconsin, Lab Mol & Computat Genom, Madison, WI 53706 USA; UCL, Dept Biol, Galton Lab, HUGO Gene Nomenclature Comm, London NW1 2HE, England","Zody, MC (reprint author), MIT, Broad Inst, 7 Cambridge Ctr, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA.",mczody@broad.mit.edu; chad@broad.mit.edu,"Hubbard, Tim/C-2567-2008; McCarroll, Steven/A-8433-2009","Hubbard, Tim/0000-0002-1767-9318; Cuomo, Christina/0000-0002-5778-960X; Gilbert, James/0000-0001-8079-3159; Wilming, Laurens/0000-0002-4154-7358; Khodiyar, Varsha/0000-0002-2743-6918; DeCaprio, Dave/0000-0001-8931-9461; Gibson, Richard Charles/0000-0001-5412-1965","Medical Research Council [G0000107]; Wellcome Trust [, 077187]",,,27,84,754,0,16,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,20-Apr,2006,440,7087,,,,,1045,1049,,10.1038/nature04689,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,034DL,WOS:000236906000035,16625196,No,,,11/20/17

For simple traits, such as overall body colour, repeated transitions by means of mutations in the same gene may be common(3-5). However, for more complex traits, the possible genetic paths may be more numerous; the molecular mechanisms underlying their independent origins and the extent to which they are constrained to follow certain genetic paths are largely unknown. Here we show that a male wing pigmentation pattern involved in courtship display has been gained and lost multiple times in a Drosophila clade. Each of the cases we have analysed (two gains and two losses) involved regulatory changes at the pleiotropic pigmentation gene yellow. Losses involved the parallel inactivation of the same cis-regulatory element (CRE), with changes at a few nucleotides sufficient to account for the functional divergence of one element between two sibling species. Surprisingly, two independent gains of wing spots resulted from the co-option of distinct ancestral CREs. These results demonstrate how the functional diversification of the modular CREs of pleiotropic genes contributes to evolutionary novelty and the independent evolution of morphological similarities.","Univ Wisconsin, Madison, WI 53706 USA; Howard Hughes Med Inst, Bock Labs, Madison, WI 53706 USA; Univ Cambridge, Dept Zool, Cambridge CB2 3EJ, England; SUNY Stony Brook, Dept Ecol & Evolut, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA","Carroll, SB (reprint author), Univ Wisconsin, 1525 Linden Dr, Madison, WI 53706 USA.",sbcarrol@wisc.edu,"Phelps, Steve/H-2263-2011; Rokas, Antonis/A-9775-2008","Rokas, Antonis/0000-0002-7248-6551",,,,29,282,288,3,52,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,20-Apr,2006,440,7087,,,,,1050,1053,,10.1038/nature04597,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,034DL,WOS:000236906000036,16625197,No,,,11/20/17

Without homeostatic synaptic scaling, neural networks can become unstable and perform suboptimally(1-3). Although much is known about the mechanisms underlying LTP and LTD4, little is known about the mechanisms responsible for synaptic scaling except that such scaling is due, at least in part, to alterations in receptor content at synapses(5-7). Here we show that synaptic scaling in response to prolonged blockade of activity is mediated by the pro-inflammatory cytokine tumour-necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha). Using mixtures of wild-type and TNF-alpha-deficient neurons and glia, we also show that glia are the source of the TNF-alpha that is required for this form of synaptic scaling. We suggest that by modulating TNF-alpha levels, glia actively participate in the homeostatic activity-dependent regulation of synaptic connectivity.","Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Dept Psychiat & Behav Sci, Nancy Pritzker Lab, Palo Alto, CA 94304 USA","Malenka, RC (reprint author), Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Dept Psychiat & Behav Sci, Nancy Pritzker Lab, Palo Alto, CA 94304 USA.",malenka@stanford.edu,"yu, yan/C-2322-2012",,,,,30,762,778,1,48,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,20-Apr,2006,440,7087,,,,,1054,1059,,10.1038/nature04671,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,034DL,WOS:000236906000037,16547515,No,,,11/20/17

For all spiking neurons, the encoding of single-neuron computations into sequences of spikes is biophysically determined by the cell's action-potential-generating mechanism. It has recently been discovered that apparently minor modifications of this mechanism can qualitatively change the nature of neuronal encoding(3,4). Here we quantitatively analyse the dynamics of action potential initiation in cortical neurons in vivo, in vitro and in computational models. Unexpectedly, key features of the initiation dynamics of cortical neuron action potentials-their rapid initiation and variable onset potential are outside the range of behaviours described by the classical Hodgkin-Huxley theory. We propose a new model based on the cooperative activation of sodium channels that reproduces the observed dynamics of action potential initiation. This new model predicts that Hodgkin-Huxley-type dynamics of action potential initiation can be induced by artificially decreasing the effective density of sodium channels. In vitro experiments confirm this prediction, supporting the hypothesis that cooperative sodium channel activation underlies the dynamics of action potential initiation in cortical neurons.","Univ Gottingen, Max Planck Inst Dynam & Self Org, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany; Univ Gottingen, Dept Phys, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany; Univ Gottingen, Bernstein Ctr Computat Neurosci, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany; Ruhr Univ Bochum, Dept Neurophysiol, D-44780 Bochum, Germany; Russian Acad Sci, Inst Higher Nervous Act & Neurophysiol, Moscow 117485, Russia","Wolf, F (reprint author), Univ Gottingen, Max Planck Inst Dynam & Self Org, Bunsenstr 10, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany.",fred@chaos.gwdg.de,"Wolf, Fred/D-5771-2011","Wolf, Fred/0000-0002-7068-3762",,,,18,171,173,1,48,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,20-Apr,2006,440,7087,,,,,1060,1063,,10.1038/nature04610,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,034DL,WOS:000236906000038,16625198,No,,,11/20/17

Here we describe a novel role for a caspase in dampening responses to bacterial infection. We show that in mice, gene-targeted deletion of caspase-12 renders animals resistant to peritonitis and septic shock. The resulting survival advantage was conferred by the ability of the caspase-12-deficient mice to clear bacterial infection more efficiently than wild-type littermates. Caspase-12 dampened the production of the pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-1 beta, IL- 18 (interferon (IFN)-gamma inducing factor) and IFN-gamma, but not tumour-necrosis factor-alpha and IL- 6, in response to various bacterial components that stimulate Toll-like receptor and NOD pathways. The IFN-gamma pathway was crucial in mediating survival of septic caspase-12-deficient mice, because administration of neutralizing antibodies to IFN-gamma receptors ablated the survival advantage that otherwise occurred in these animals. Mechanistically, caspase-12 associated with caspase-1 and inhibited its activity. Notably, the protease function of caspase-12 was not necessary for this effect, as the catalytically inactive caspase-12 mutant Cys299Ala also inhibited caspase-1 and IL-1 beta production to the same extent as wild-type caspase-12. In this regard, caspase-12 seems to be the cFLIP counterpart for regulating the inflammatory branch of the caspase cascade. In mice, caspase-12 deficiency confers resistance to sepsis and its presence exerts a dominant-negative suppressive effect on caspase-1, resulting in enhanced vulnerability to bacterial infection and septic mortality.","Merck Res Labs, Rahway, NJ 07065 USA; La Jolla Inst Allergy & Immunol, Dept Cellular Immunol, San Diego, CA 92121 USA; Scripps Res Inst, Dept Immunol, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA","Green, DR (reprint author), Merck Res Labs, Rahway, NJ 07065 USA.",douglas.green@stjude.org; donald_nicholson@merck.com,,"Droin, Nathalie/0000-0002-6099-5324",,,,18,218,231,0,14,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,20-Apr,2006,440,7087,,,,,1064,1068,,10.1038/nature04656,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,034DL,WOS:000236906000039,16625199,No,,,11/20/17

Current models postulate that Rac promotes membrane protrusion at the leading edge and that RhoA regulates contractility in the cell body(1,2). However, there is evidence that RhoA also regulates membrane protrusion(3,4). Here we use a fluorescent biosensor, based on a novel design preserving reversible membrane interactions, to visualize the spatiotemporal dynamics of RhoA activity during cell migration. In randomly migrating cells, RhoA activity is concentrated in a sharp band directly at the edge of protrusions. It is observed sporadically in retracting tails, and is low in the cell body. RhoA activity is also associated with peripheral ruffles and pinocytic vesicles, but not with dorsal ruffles induced by platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF). In contrast to randomly migrating cells, PDGF-induced membrane protrusions have low RhoA activity, potentially because PDGF strongly activates Rac, which has previously been shown to antagonize RhoA activity(5,6). Our data therefore show that different extracellular cues induce distinct patterns of RhoA signalling during membrane protrusion.","Univ N Carolina, Dept Pharmacol, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA; Univ N Carolina, Lineberger Canc Ctr, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA; Scripps Res Inst, Dept Cell Biol, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA","Pertz, O (reprint author), Univ N Carolina, Dept Pharmacol, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA.",pertz@ucsd.edu; khahn@med.unc.edu,,"Hodgson, Louis/0000-0001-9188-7580",,,,21,462,470,4,52,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,20-Apr,2006,440,7087,,,,,1069,1072,,10.1038/nature04665,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,034DL,WOS:000236906000040,16547516,No,,,11/20/17

However, such personalization of drug treatments requires the ability to predict how different individuals will respond to a particular drug/dose combination. After initial optimism, there is increasing recognition of the limitations of the pharmacogenomic approach, which does not take account of important environmental influences on drug absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion(3-5). For instance, a major factor underlying inter-individual variation in drug effects is variation in metabolic phenotype, which is influenced not only by genotype but also by environmental factors such as nutritional status, the gut microbiota, age, disease and the co- or pre-administration of other drugs(6,7). Thus, although genetic variation is clearly important, it seems unlikely that personalized drug therapy will be enabled for a wide range of major diseases using genomic knowledge alone. Here we describe an alternative and conceptually new 'pharmaco-metabonomic' approach to personalizing drug treatment, which uses a combination of pre-dose metabolite profiling and chemometrics to model and predict the responses of individual subjects. We provide proof-of-principle for this new approach, which is sensitive to both genetic and environmental influences, with a study of paracetamol (acetaminophen) administered to rats.

The application of this theory of divergent molecular evolution to promiscuous enzymes may allow us to design enzymes with more specificity and higher activity. Many structural and biochemical analyses have identified the active or binding site residues important for functional plasticity (plasticity residues)(6-10). To understand how these residues contribute to molecular evolution, and thereby formulate a design methodology, plasticity residues were probed in the active site of the promiscuous sesquiterpene synthase gamma-humulene synthase(11,12). Identified plasticity residues were systematically recombined based on a mathematical model in order to construct novel terpene synthases, each catalysing the synthesis of one or a few very different sesquiterpenes.

Australopithecus species differ markedly from extant African apes and candidate ancestral hominids such as Ardipithecus, Orrorin and Sahelanthropus. The earliest described Australopithecus species is Au. anamensis, the probable chronospecies ancestor of Au. afarensis. Here we describe newly discovered fossils from the Middle Awash study area that extend the known Au. anamensis range into northeastern Ethiopia. The new fossils are from chronometrically controlled stratigraphic sequences and date to about 4.1-4.2 million years ago. They include diagnostic craniodental remains, the largest hominid canine yet recovered, and the earliest Australopithecus femur. These new fossils are sampled from a woodland context.

Cooperation between these lymphocyte subsets involves recognition of antigens co-presented by the same dendritic cell, but the frequencies of such antigen-bearing cells early in an infection and of the relevant naive T cells are both low. This suggests that an active mechanism facilitates the necessary cell-cell associations. Here we demonstrate that after immunization but before antigen recognition, naive CD8(+) T cells in immunogen-draining lymph nodes upregulate the chemokine receptor CCR5, permitting these cells to be attracted to sites of antigen-specific dendritic cell-CD4(+) T cell interaction where the cognate chemokines CCL3 and CCL4 (also known as MIP-1 alpha and MIP-1 beta) are produced. Interference with this actively guided recruitment markedly reduces the ability of CD4(+) T cells to promote memory CD8(+) T-cell generation, indicating that an orchestrated series of differentiation events drives nonrandom cell-cell interactions within lymph nodes, optimizing CD8(+) T-cell immune responses involving the few antigen-specific precursors present in the naive repertoire.","NIAID, Lymphocyte Biol Sect, Immunol Lab, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, New York, NY 10021 USA; Johannes Gutenberg Univ Mainz, Dept Dermatol, D-55131 Mainz, Germany; Med Univ Vienna, Dept Rheumatol, Gen Hosp Vienna, A-1090 Vienna, Austria","Germain, RN (reprint author), NIAID, Lymphocyte Biol Sect, Immunol Lab, NIH, 9000 Rockville Pike, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA.",rgermain@nih.gov,,"Huang, Alex/0000-0002-5701-4521",Intramural NIH HHS,,,38,410,422,1,16,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,13-Apr,2006,440,7086,,,,,890,895,,10.1038/nature04651,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,031WU,WOS:000236736700031,16612374,No,,,11/20/17

Although its spectrum is dominated by broad hydrogen lines, the narrower lines of the heavy elements suggested slow to moderate rotation, giving confidence that the ground-based calibration of its visible spectrum could be safely extrapolated into the ultraviolet and near-infrared (through atmosphere models(2)), where it also serves as the primary photometric calibrator. But there have been problems: the star is too bright compared to its peers(3) and it has unusually shaped absorption line profiles, leading some(4,5) to suggest that it is a distorted, rapidly rotating star seen pole-on. Here we report optical interferometric observations that show that Vega has the asymmetric brightness distribution of the bright, slightly offset polar axis of a star rotating at 93 per cent of its breakup speed. In addition to explaining the unusual brightness and line shape peculiarities, this result leads to the prediction of an excess of near-infrared emission compared to the visible, in agreement with observations(6,7). The large temperature differences predicted across its surface call into question composition determinations, adding uncertainty to Vega's age and opening the possibility that its debris disk(8) could be substantially older than previously thought(9,10).","SUNY Stony Brook, Dept Phys & Astron, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA; European So Observ, Santiago 19, Chile; USN Observ, Washington, DC 20392 USA; USN, Res Lab, Washington, DC 20375 USA; US Naval Observ, Flagstaff Stn, Flagstaff, AZ 86001 USA; Seabrook Engn, Seabrook, MD 20706 USA; Interferomet Inc, Herndon, VA USA","Peterson, DM (reprint author), SUNY Stony Brook, Dept Phys & Astron, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA.",dpeterson@astro.sunysb.edu,,,,,,29,121,121,0,2,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,13-Apr,2006,440,7086,,,,,896,899,,10.1038/nature04661,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,031WU,WOS:000236736700032,16612375,No,,,11/20/17

To understand the limits of this assumption, it is important to find and study systems that are not ergodic, and thus do not reach thermal equilibrium. A few complex systems have been proposed that are expected not to thermalize because their dynamics are integrable(1,2). Some nearly integrable systems of many particles have been studied numerically, and shown not to ergodically sample phase space(3). However, there has been no experimental demonstration of such a system with many degrees of freedom that does not approach thermal equilibrium. Here we report the preparation of out-of-equilibrium arrays of trapped one-dimensional (1D) Bose gases, each containing from 40 to 250 (87)Rb atoms, which do not noticeably equilibrate even after thousands of collisions. Our results are probably explainable by the well-known fact that a homogeneous 1D Bose gas with point-like collisional interactions is integrable. Until now, however, the time evolution of out-of-equilibrium 1D Bose gases has been a theoretically unsettled issue(4-6), as practical factors such as harmonic trapping and imperfectly point-like interactions may compromise integrability. The absence of damping in 1D Bose gases may lead to potential applications in force sensing and atom interferometry.","Penn State Univ, Dept Phys, Davey Lab 104, University Pk, PA 16802 USA","Weiss, DS (reprint author), Penn State Univ, Dept Phys, Davey Lab 104, University Pk, PA 16802 USA.",dsweiss@phys.psu.edu,"Weiss, David/B-7886-2010",,,,,30,932,934,8,67,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,13-Apr,2006,440,7086,,,,,900,903,,10.1038/nature04693,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,031WU,WOS:000236736700033,16612376,No,,,11/20/17

Efficient parametric conversion is the paradigm for the generation of twin or entangled photons for quantum optics applications such as quantum cryptography(3,4), or for the generation of new frequencies in spectral domains not accessible by existing devices. Rapid development in the field of quantum information requires monolithic, alignment-free sources that enable efficient coupling into optical fibres and possibly electrical injection. During the past decade, much effort has been devoted to the development of integrated devices for quantuminformation(5-7) and to the realization of all-semiconductor parametric oscillators(8,9). Nevertheless, at present optical parametric oscillators typically rely on nonlinear crystals placed into complex external cavities, and pumped by powerful external lasers. Long interaction lengths are typically required and the phase mismatch between the parametric waves propagating at different velocities(2) results in poor parametric conversion efficiencies. Here we report the demonstration of parametric oscillation in a monolithic semiconductor triple microcavity with signal, pump and idler waves propagating along the vertical direction of the nanostructure. Alternatively, signal and idler beams can also be collected at finite angles, allowing the generation of entangled photon pairs. The pump threshold intensity is low enough to envisage the realization of an all-semiconductor electrically pumped micro-parametric oscillator.","Ecole Normale Super, Lab Pierre Aigrain, F-75231 Paris 05, France; CNRS, LPN, F-91460 Marcoussis, France","Tignon, J (reprint author), Ecole Normale Super, Lab Pierre Aigrain, 24 Rue Lhomond, F-75231 Paris 05, France.",Jerome.Tignon@lpa.ens.fr,"Lemaitre, Aristide/B-9899-2009; Ciuti, Cristiano/K-7248-2012; Bloch, Jacqueline/S-2062-2017","Lemaitre, Aristide/0000-0003-1892-9726; Ciuti, Cristiano/0000-0002-1134-7013; Bloch, Jacqueline/0000-0001-7823-8420",,,,29,103,103,5,27,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,13-Apr,2006,440,7086,,,,,904,907,,10.1038/nature04602,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,031WU,WOS:000236736700034,16612377,No,,,11/20/17

This has generated increased interest in the use of white electroluminescent organic light-emitting devices, owing to their potential for significantly improved efficiency over incandescent sources combined with low-cost, high-throughput manufacturability. The most impressive characteristics of such devices reported to date have been achieved in all-phosphor-doped devices, which have the potential for 100 per cent internal quantum efficiency(2): the phosphorescent molecules harness the triplet excitons that constitute three-quarters of the bound electron-hole pairs that form during charge injection, and which (unlike the remaining singlet excitons) would otherwise recombine non-radiatively. Here we introduce a different device concept that exploits a blue fluorescent molecule in exchange for a phosphorescent dopant, in combination with green and red phosphor dopants, to yield high power efficiency and stable colour balance, while maintaining the potential for unity internal quantum efficiency. Two distinct modes of energy transfer within this device serve to channel nearly all of the triplet energy to the phosphorescent dopants, retaining the singlet energy exclusively on the blue fluorescent dopant. Additionally, eliminating the exchange energy loss to the blue fluorophore allows for roughly 20 per cent increased power efficiency compared to a fully phosphorescent device. Our device challenges incandescent sources by exhibiting total external quantum and power efficiencies that peak at 18.7 +/- 0.5 per cent and 37.6 +/- 0.6 lm W-1, respectively, decreasing to 18.4 +/- 0.5 per cent and 23.8 +/- 0.5 lm W-1 at a high luminance of 500 cd m(-2).","Princeton Univ, Dept Elect Engn, Princeton Inst Sci & Technol Mat PRISM, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; Univ So Calif, Dept Chem, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA","Forrest, SR (reprint author), Univ Michigan, Dept Elect Engn & Comp Sci, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",forrest@princeton.edu,"Ma, Biwu/B-6943-2012","Thompson, Mark/0000-0002-7764-4096",,,,23,1509,1551,50,505,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,13-Apr,2006,440,7086,,,,,908,912,,10.1038/nature04645,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,031WU,WOS:000236736700035,16612378,No,,,11/20/17

Models to explain highly melt-depleted but garnet-bearing rock compositions require multi-stage processes with garnet and clinopyroxene possibly of secondary origin(1,3). Here we report on orogenic peridotites (fragments of cratonic mantle incorporated into the crust during continent-continent plate collision(4)) from Otroy, western Norway.

Freshwater sediments often receive increased downward fluxes of nitrate from agricultural runoff and upward fluxes of methane generated by anaerobic decomposition(3). In theory, prokaryotes should be capable of using nitrate to oxidize methane anaerobically, but such organisms have neither been observed in nature nor isolated in the laboratory(4-8). Microbial oxidation of methane is thus believed to proceed only with oxygen or sulphate(9,10). Here we show that the direct, anaerobic oxidation of methane coupled to denitrification of nitrate is possible. A microbial consortium, enriched from anoxic sediments, oxidized methane to carbon dioxide coupled to denitrification in the complete absence of oxygen. This consortium consisted of two microorganisms, a bacterium representing a phylum without any cultured species and an archaeon distantly related to marine methanotrophic Archaea. The detection of relatives of these prokaryotes in different freshwater ecosystems worldwide(11-14) indicates that the reaction presented here may make a substantial contribution to biological methane and nitrogen cycles.","Univ Nijmegen St Radboud Hosp, Inst Water & Wetland Res, Dept Microbiol, NL-6525 ED Nijmegen, Netherlands; Univ Nijmegen St Radboud Hosp, Inst Water & Wetland Res, Dept Aquat Ecol & Environm Biol, NL-6525 ED Nijmegen, Netherlands; Dept Marine Biogeochem & Toxicol, Royal Netherlands Inst Sea Res NIOZ, NL-1790 AB Den Burg, Netherlands","Strous, M (reprint author), Univ Nijmegen St Radboud Hosp, Inst Water & Wetland Res, Dept Microbiol, Toernooiveld 1, NL-6525 ED Nijmegen, Netherlands.",m.strous@science.ru.nl,"Jetten, Mike/B-8834-2011; Ettwig, Katharina /B-9395-2011; Smolders, Alfons/H-2583-2012; Sinninghe Damste, Jaap/F-6128-2011; Op den Camp, Huub/F-5114-2011; Strous, Marc/B-4064-2017","Jetten, Mike/0000-0002-4691-7039; Sinninghe Damste, Jaap/0000-0002-8683-1854; Op den Camp, Huub/0000-0003-1990-9030; Strous, Marc/0000-0001-9600-3828",,,,28,473,528,33,457,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,13-Apr,2006,440,7086,,,,,918,921,,10.1038/nature04617,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,031WU,WOS:000236736700037,16612380,No,,,11/20/17

However, it is unknown whether CO2-induced stimulation of plant growth and biomass accumulation will be sustained or whether limited nitrogen (N) availability constrains greater plant growth in a CO2-enriched world(1-9). Here we show, after a six-year field study of perennial grassland species grown under ambient and elevated levels of CO2 and N, that low availability of N progressively suppresses the positive response of plant biomass to elevated CO2. Initially, the stimulation of total plant biomass by elevated CO2 was no greater at enriched than at ambient N supply. After four to six years, however, elevated CO2 stimulated plant biomass much less under ambient than enriched N supply. This response was consistent with the temporally divergent effects of elevated CO2 on soil and plant N dynamics at differing levels of N supply. Our results indicate that variability in availability of soil N and deposition of atmospheric N are both likely to influence the response of plant biomass accumulation to elevated atmospheric CO2. Given that limitations to productivity resulting from the insufficient availability of N are widespread in both unmanaged and managed vegetation(5,7-9), soil N supply is probably an important constraint on global terrestrial responses to elevated CO2.","Univ Minnesota, Dept Forest Resources, St Paul, MN 55108 USA; Univ Minnesota, Dept Ecol Evolut & Behav, St Paul, MN 55108 USA; Univ Wisconsin, Dept Biol, Eau Claire, WI 54701 USA; Univ Michigan, Sch Nat Resources & Environm, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; Univ Nebraska, Sch Biol Sci, Lincoln, NE 68588 USA; Columbia Univ, Dept Ecol Evolut & Environm Biol, New York, NY 10027 USA","Reich, PB (reprint author), Univ Minnesota, Dept Forest Resources, St Paul, MN 55108 USA.",preich@umn.edu,"; West, Jason/G-8833-2012","Ellsworth, David/0000-0002-9699-2272; Hobbie, Sarah/0000-0001-5159-031X; Trost, Jared/0000-0003-0431-2151; Lee, Tali/0000-0002-3933-6607; West, Jason/0000-0002-7811-8020",,,,29,454,505,16,302,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,13-Apr,2006,440,7086,,,,,922,925,,10.1038/nature04486,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,031WU,WOS:000236736700038,16612381,No,,,11/20/17

Providing offspring with additional nutrition should be favoured by natural selection when the consequent increased fitness of the young offsets any corresponding reduction in fecundity(2). Alternative forms of nutrition may allow parents to delay and potentially redirect their investment. Here we report a remarkable form of parental care and mechanism of parent-offspring nutrient transfer in a caecilian amphibian. Boulengerula taitanus is a direct-developing, oviparous caecilian(3), the skin of which is transformed in brooding females to provide a rich supply of nutrients for the developing offspring. Young animals are equipped with a specialized dentition, which they use to peel and eat the outer layer of their mother's modified skin. This new form of parental care provides a plausible intermediate stage in the evolution of viviparity in caecilians. At independence, offspring of viviparous and of oviparous dermatotrophic caecilians are relatively large despite being provided with relatively little yolk. The specialized dentition of skin-feeding (dermatophagous) caecilians may constitute a pre-adaptation to the fetal feeding on the oviduct lining of viviparous caecilians.","Nat Hist Museum, Dept Zool, London SW7 5BD, England; Leiden Univ, Inst Biol, NL-2311 GP Leiden, Netherlands; Inst Butantan, Lab Biol Celular, BR-05503900 Sao Paulo, Brazil; Univ Dusseldorf, Inst Zoomorphol & Zellbiol, D-40225 Dusseldorf, Germany; Univ Michigan, Museum Zool, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; Univ Michigan, Dept Ecol & Evolut Biol, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA","Wilkinson, M (reprint author), Nat Hist Museum, Dept Zool, Cromwell Rd, London SW7 5BD, England.",mw@bmnh.org,"Kupfer, Alexander/B-5417-2010; Mueller, Hendrik/B-4979-2010; Jared, Carlos/D-3299-2012; Wilkinson, Mark/J-2026-2014; Antoniazzi, Marta/A-3495-2017","Mueller, Hendrik/0000-0001-6764-7376; Jared, Carlos/0000-0002-9117-6276; Wilkinson, Mark/0000-0002-9459-8976; ",,,,28,47,54,4,43,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,13-Apr,2006,440,7086,,,,,926,929,,10.1038/nature04403,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,031WU,WOS:000236736700039,16612382,No,,,11/20/17

This was suggested to be the result of a shared balanced polymorphism, defining the first, and now classic, example of the effects of balancing selection in great apes. In humans, variable PTC sensitivity is largely controlled by the segregation of two common alleles at the TAS2R38 locus, which encode receptor variants with different ligand affinities(2-4). Here we show that PTC taste sensitivity in chimpanzees is also controlled by two common alleles of TAS2R38; however, neither of these alleles is shared with humans. Instead, a mutation of the initiation codon results in the use of an alternative downstream start codon and production of a truncated receptor variant that fails to respond to PTC in vitro. Association testing of PTC sensitivity in a cohort of captive chimpanzees confirmed that chimpanzee TAS2R38 genotype accurately predicts taster status in vivo. Therefore, although Fisher et al.'s observations(1) were accurate, their explanation was wrong. Humans and chimpanzees share variable taste sensitivity to bitter compounds mediated by PTC receptor variants, but the molecular basis of this variation has arisen twice, independently, in the two species.","Univ Utah, Dept Human Genet, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA; German Inst Human Nutr Potsdam Rehbruecke, D-14558 Nuthetal, Germany; SW Fdn Biomed Res, Dept Comparat Med, San Antonio, TX 78245 USA; Arizona State Univ, Sch Human Evolut & Social Change, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA","Wooding, S (reprint author), Univ Utah, Dept Human Genet, 15 N 2030 E, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA.",swooding@genetics.utah.edu; mbamshad@u.washington.edu,"Stone, Anne/B-5719-2009; Marion-Poll, Frederic/D-8882-2011","Marion-Poll, Frederic/0000-0001-6824-0180",,,,30,78,81,4,62,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,13-Apr,2006,440,7086,,,,,930,934,,10.1038/nature04655,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,031WU,WOS:000236736700040,16612383,No,,,11/20/17

The vesicle membrane is then retrieved by endocytosis, and synaptic vesicles are regenerated and re-filled with neurotransmitter(1). Although many aspects of vesicle recycling are understood, the fate of the vesicles after fusion is still unclear. Do their components diffuse on the plasma membrane, or do they remain together? This question has been difficult to answer because synaptic vesicles are too small (similar to 40 nm in diameter) and too densely packed to be resolved by available fluorescence microscopes. Here we use stimulated emission depletion (STED)(2) to reduce the focal spot area by about an order of magnitude below the diffraction limit, thereby resolving individual vesicles in the synapse. We show that synaptotagmin I, a protein resident in the vesicle membrane, remains clustered in isolated patches on the presynaptic membrane regardless of whether the nerve terminals are mildly active or intensely stimulated. This suggests that at least some vesicle constituents remain together during recycling. Our study also demonstrates that questions involving cellular structures with dimensions of a few tens of nanometres can be resolved with conventional far-field optics and visible light.","Max Planck Inst Biophys Chem, Dept Neurobiol, D-37077 Gottingen, Germany; Max Planck Inst Biophys Chem, Dept Nanobiophoton, D-37077 Gottingen, Germany","Jahn, R (reprint author), Max Planck Inst Biophys Chem, Dept Neurobiol, D-37077 Gottingen, Germany.",rjahn@gwdg.de,,"Jahn, Reinhard/0000-0003-1542-3498; Willig, Katrin/0000-0002-1860-334X",,,,26,530,549,12,219,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,13-Apr,2006,440,7086,,,,,935,939,,10.1038/nature04592,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,031WU,WOS:000236736700041,16612384,No,,,11/20/17

Disease control is hampered by the occurrence of multi-drug-resistant strains of the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum(2,3). Synthetic antimalarial drugs and malarial vaccines are currently being developed, but their efficacy against malaria awaits rigorous clinical testing(4,5). Artemisinin, a sesquiterpene lactone endoperoxide extracted from Artemisia annua L (family Asteraceae; commonly known as sweet wormwood), is highly effective against multi-drug-resistant Plasmodium spp., but is in short supply and unaffordable to most malaria sufferers(6). Although total synthesis of artemisinin is difficult and costly(7), the semi-synthesis of artemisinin or any derivative from microbially sourced artemisinic acid, its immediate precursor, could be a cost-effective, environmentally friendly, high-quality and reliable source of artemisinin(8,9). Here we report the engineering of Saccharomyces cerevisiae to produce high titres (up to 100 mg l(-1)) of artemisinic acid using an engineered mevalonate pathway, amorphadiene synthase, and a novel cytochrome P450 monooxygenase (CYP71AV1) from A. annua that performs a three-step oxidation of amorpha-4,11-diene to artemisinic acid. The synthesized artemisinic acid is transported out and retained on the outside of the engineered yeast, meaning that a simple and inexpensive purification process can be used to obtain the desired product. Although the engineered yeast is already capable of producing artemisinic acid at a significantly higher specific productivity than A. annua, yield optimization and industrial scale-up will be required to raise artemisinic acid production to a level high enough to reduce artemisinin combination therapies to significantly below their current prices.","Univ Calif Berkeley, Lawrence Berkeley Lab, Calif Inst Quantitat Biomed Res, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; Univ Calif Berkeley, Lawrence Berkeley Lab, Dept Chem Engn, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; Univ Calif Berkeley, Lawrence Berkeley Lab, Dept Chem, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; Univ Calif Berkeley, Lawrence Berkeley Lab, Dept Bioengn, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; Univ Calif Berkeley, Lawrence Berkeley Lab, Berkeley Ctr Synth Biol, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; Amyris Biotechnol Inc, Emeryville, CA 94608 USA","Keasling, JD (reprint author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Lawrence Berkeley Lab, Calif Inst Quantitat Biomed Res, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",keasling@berkeley.edu,"Keasling, Jay/J-9162-2012; Ro, Dae-Kyun/G-9289-2012","Keasling, Jay/0000-0003-4170-6088; Ro, Dae-Kyun/0000-0003-1288-5347",,,,26,1199,1362,81,689,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,13-Apr,2006,440,7086,,,,,940,943,,10.1038/nature04640,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,031WU,WOS:000236736700042,16612385,No,,,11/20/17

Little is known about why insulin resistance occurs in so many contexts. Do the various insults that trigger insulin resistance act through a common mechanism? Or, as has been suggested(1), do they use distinct cellular pathways? Here we report a genomic analysis of two cellular models of insulin resistance, one induced by treatment with the cytokine tumour-necrosis factor-alpha and the other with the glucocorticoid dexamethasone. Gene expression analysis suggests that reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels are increased in both models, and we confirmed this through measures of cellular redox state. ROS have previously been proposed to be involved in insulin resistance, although evidence for a causal role has been scant. We tested this hypothesis in cell culture using six treatments designed to alter ROS levels, including two small molecules and four transgenes; all ameliorated insulin resistance to varying degrees. One of these treatments was tested in obese, insulin-resistant mice and was shown to improve insulin sensitivity and glucose homeostasis. Together, our findings suggest that increased ROS levels are an important trigger for insulin resistance in numerous settings.","MIT, Broad Inst, Cambridge, MA 02141 USA; Harvard Univ, Broad Inst, Cambridge, MA 02141 USA; MIT, Dept Biol, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; Whitehead Inst Biomed Res, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; Beth Israel Deaconess Med Ctr, Div Endocrinol, Dept Med, Boston, MA 02214 USA; Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Syst Biol, Boston, MA 02115 USA","Rosen, ED (reprint author), MIT, Broad Inst, Cambridge, MA 02141 USA.",erosen@bidmc.harvard.edu; lander@broad.mit.edu,,,,,,30,1249,1319,19,194,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,13-Apr,2006,440,7086,,,,,944,948,,10.1038/nature04634,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,031WU,WOS:000236736700043,16612386,No,,,11/20/17

TLRs 7 and 9 can recognize nucleic acids(3-6) and trigger signalling cascades that activate plasmacytoid dendritic cells to produce interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha) (refs 7, 8). TLR7/9-mediated dendritic cell activation is critical for antiviral immunity but also contributes to the pathogenesis of systemic lupus erythematosus, a disease in which serum IFN-alpha levels are elevated owing to plasmacytoid dendritic cell activation(8,9). TLR7/9-induced IFN-alpha induction depends on a molecular complex that contains a TLR adaptor, MyD88, and IFN regulatory factor 7 (IRF-7) (refs 10-14), but the underlying molecular mechanisms are as yet unknown. Here we show that I kappa B kinase-alpha (IKK-alpha) is critically involved in TLR7/9-induced IFN-alpha production. TLR7/9-induced IFN-alpha production was severely impaired in IKK-alpha-deficient plasmacytoid dendritic cells, whereas inflammatory cytokine induction was decreased but still occurred. Kinase-deficient IKK-alpha inhibited the ability of MyD88 to activate the Ifna promoter in synergy with IRF-7. Furthermore, IKK-alpha associated with and phosphorylated IRF-7. Our results identify a role for IKK-alpha in TLR7/9 signalling, and highlight IKK-alpha as a potential target for manipulating TLR-induced IFN-alpha production.","RIKEN, Res Ctr Allergy & Immunol, Host Def Lab, Tsurumi Ku, Kanagawa 2300045, Japan; RIKEN, Res Ctr Allergy & Immunol, Lab Immunogenom, Tsurumi Ku, Kanagawa 2300045, Japan; Univ Tokushima, Div Mol Immunol, Inst Enzyme Res, Tokushima 7708503, Japan; Res Inst Microbial Dis, Dept Host Def, Suita, Osaka 5650871, Japan; ERATO, Japan Sci & Technol Agcy, Suita, Osaka 5650871, Japan; Kazusa DNA Res Inst, Chiba 2920818, Japan","Kaisho, T (reprint author), RIKEN, Res Ctr Allergy & Immunol, Host Def Lab, Tsurumi Ku, Suehirocho 1-7-22, Kanagawa 2300045, Japan.",tkaisho@rcai.riken.jp,"Akira, Shizuo/C-3134-2009; Ohara, Osamu/A-9119-2012; Kaisho, Tsuneyasu/B-4130-2012; Ohara, Osamu/G-5448-2015; Tanaka, Takashi/O-8254-2015","Ohara, Osamu/0000-0002-3328-9571; Hoshino, Katsuaki/0000-0003-0493-4815",,,,30,224,243,0,19,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,13-Apr,2006,440,7086,,,,,949,953,,10.1038/nature04641,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,031WU,WOS:000236736700044,16612387,No,,,11/20/17

Here we test this hypothesis for mitotic exit, which is regulated by degradation of the cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (Cdk1) activator, cyclin B3-5. Application of chemical Cdk1 inhibitors to cells in mitosis induces cytokinesis and other normal aspects of mitotic exit, including cyclin B degradation. However, chromatid segregation fails, resulting in entrapment of chromatin in the midbody. If cyclin B degradation is blocked with a proteasome inhibitor or by expression of non-degradable cyclin B, Cdk inhibitors will nonetheless induce mitotic exit and cytokinesis. However, if after mitotic exit, the Cdk1 inhibitor is washed free from cells in which cyclin B degradation is blocked, the cells can revert back to M phase. This reversal is characterized by chromosome recondensation, nuclear envelope breakdown, assembly of microtubules into a mitotic spindle, and in most cases, dissolution of the midbody, reopening of the cleavage furrow, and realignment of chromosomes at the metaphase plate. These findings demonstrate that proteasome-dependent degradation of cyclin B provides directionality for the M phase to G1 transition.","Oklahoma Med Res Fdn, Program Mol Cell & Dev Biol, Oklahoma City, OK 73104 USA; Univ Virginia, Sch Med, Dept Biochem & Mol Genet, Charlottesville, VA 22908 USA","Gorbsky, GJ (reprint author), Oklahoma Med Res Fdn, Program Mol Cell & Dev Biol, 825 NE 13th St, Oklahoma City, OK 73104 USA.",GJG@omrf.ouhsc.edu,,"Stukenberg, Todd/0000-0002-6788-2111; Gorbsky, Gary/0000-0003-3076-4725",NIGMS NIH HHS [R01 GM050412],,,22,115,117,0,11,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,13-Apr,2006,440,7086,,,,,954,958,,10.1038/nature04652,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,031WU,WOS:000236736700045,16612388,No,,,11/20/17

In these models and in previous solution-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) studies using detergent-solubilized membrane proteins(5,6), scorpion toxins were docked to the extracellular entrance of the K+ channel pore assuming rigid, preformed binding sites(7-13). Using high-resolution solid-state NMR spectroscopy, here we show that high-affinity binding of the scorpion toxin kaliotoxin to a chimaeric K+ channel (KcsA- Kv1.3)(14,15) is associated with significant structural rearrangements in both molecules. Our approach involves a combined analysis of chemical shifts and proton-proton distances and demonstrates that solid-state NMR is a sensitive method for analysing the structure of a membrane protein-inhibitor complex.

The origin of limbs probably involved the elaboration and proliferation of features already present in the fins of fish such as Tiktaalik.","Univ Chicago, Dept Organismal Biol & Anat, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; Acad Nat Sci Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA 19103 USA; Harvard Univ, Dept Organism & Evolut Biol, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; Harvard Univ, Museum Comparat Zool, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA","Shubin, NH (reprint author), Univ Chicago, Dept Organismal Biol & Anat, 1025 E 57Th St, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.",nshubin@uchicago.edu,,,,,,32,144,152,22,202,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,6-Apr,2006,440,7085,,,,,764,771,,10.1038/nature04637,,8,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,029GH,WOS:000236548400034,16598250,No,,,11/20/17

If some of the explosion ejecta fails to escape, it may fall back onto the neutron star(1) or it may possess sufficient angular momentum to form a disk(2). Such 'fallback' is both a general prediction of current supernova models(3) and, if the material pushes the neutron star over its stability limit, a possible mode of black hole formation(4). Fallback disks could dramatically affect the early evolution of pulsars(2,5), yet there are few observational constraints on whether significant fallback occurs or even the actual existence of such disks. Here we report the discovery of mid-infrared emission from a cool disk around an isolated young X-ray pulsar. The disk does not power the pulsar's X-ray emission but is passively illuminated by these X-rays. The estimated mass of the disk is of the order of 10 Earth masses, and its lifetime (>= 10(6) years) significantly exceeds the spin-down age of the pulsar, supporting a supernova fallback origin. The disk resembles protoplanetary disks seen around ordinary young stars(6), suggesting the possibility of planet formation around young neutron stars.","MIT, Kavli Inst Astrophys & Space Res, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA","Chakrabarty, D (reprint author), MIT, Kavli Inst Astrophys & Space Res, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",deepto@space.mit.edu,,,,,,30,191,194,0,2,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,6-Apr,2006,440,7085,,,,,772,775,,10.1038/nature04669,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,029GH,WOS:000236548400035,16598251,No,,,11/20/17

This suggests that self-shielding of CO due to photo-dissociation, which is a well understood process in molecular clouds, also led to evolution in the isotopic abundances in the early Solar System. Here we report measurements of oxygen isotopic abundances in lunar grains that were recently exposed to the solar wind. We find that O-16 is underabundant, opposite to an earlier finding(5) based on studies of ancient metal grains. Our result, however, is more difficult to understand within the context of current models, because there is no clear way to make O-16 more abundant in Solar System rocks than in the Sun.","Australian Natl Univ, Res Sch Earth Sci, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia; Lunar & Planetary Inst, Houston, TX 77058 USA","Ireland, TR (reprint author), Australian Natl Univ, Res Sch Earth Sci, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia.",Trevor.Ireland@anu.edu.au,"Ireland, Trevor/A-4993-2008","Ireland, Trevor/0000-0001-7617-3889; Norman, Marc/0000-0002-1357-5415",,,,27,52,52,1,11,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,6-Apr,2006,440,7085,,,,,776,778,,10.1038/nature04611,,3,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,029GH,WOS:000236548400036,16598252,No,,,11/20/17

This is a quantum interference effect, which occurs because two possible paths - in which the photons leave by different output ports - interfere destructively. This effect was first observed in parametric downconversion(1) ( in which a nonlinear crystal splits a single photon into two photons of lower energy), then from two separate downconversion crystals(2), as well as with single photons produced one after the other by the same quantum emitter(3-6). With the recent developments in quantum information research, much attention has been devoted to this interference effect as a resource for quantum data processing using linear optics techniques(2,7-11). To ensure the scalability of schemes based on these ideas, it is crucial that indistinguishable photons are emitted by a collection of synchronized, but otherwise independent sources. Here we demonstrate the quantum interference of two single photons emitted by two independently trapped single atoms, bridging the gap towards the simultaneous emission of many indistinguishable single photons by different emitters. Our data analysis shows that the observed coalescence is mainly limited by wavefront matching of the light emitted by the two atoms, and to a lesser extent by the motion of each atom in its own trap.","Ctr Univ Orsay, Lab Charles Fabry Inst Opt, UMR 8501, F-91403 Orsay, France","Browaeys, A (reprint author), Ctr Univ Orsay, Lab Charles Fabry Inst Opt, UMR 8501, Batiment 503, F-91403 Orsay, France.",antoine.browaeys@iota.u-psud.fr,"Jones, Matthew/C-2595-2009; Browaeys, Antoine/E-1547-2017; Beugnon, Jerome/R-4691-2017","Jones, Matthew/0000-0003-1514-5977; ",,,,22,193,195,5,40,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,6-Apr,2006,440,7085,,,,,779,782,,10.1038/nature04628,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,029GH,WOS:000236548400037,16598253,No,,,11/20/17

In particular, the ability to print semiconductor devices using liquid-phase materials could prove essential for some envisaged applications, such as large-area flexible displays. Recent research in this area has largely been focused on organic semiconductors(8-11), some of which have mobilities comparable to that of amorphous silicon(11) (a-Si); but issues of reliability remain. Solution processing of metal chalcogenide semiconductors to fabricate stable and high-performance transistors has also been reported(12,13). This class of materials is being explored as a possible substitute for silicon, given the complex and expensive manufacturing processes required to fabricate devices from the latter. However, if high-quality silicon films could be prepared by a solution process, this situation might change drastically. Here we demonstrate the solution processing of silicon thin-film transistors (TFTs) using a silane-based liquid precursor. Using this precursor, we have prepared polycrystalline silicon ( poly-Si) films by both spin-coating and ink-jet printing, from which we fabricate TFTs with mobilities of 108 cm(2) V-1 s(-1) and 6.5 cm(2) V-1 s(-1), respectively. Although the processing conditions have yet to be optimized, these mobilities are already greater than those that have been achieved in solution-processed organic TFTs, and they exceed those of a-Si TFTs (<= 1 cm(2) V-1 s(-1)).","Seiko Epson Corp, Technol Platform Res Ctr, Nagano 3990293, Japan; JSR Corp, Fine Elect Res Labs, Yokaichi 5108552, Japan","Furusawa, M (reprint author), Seiko Epson Corp, Technol Platform Res Ctr, 281 Fujimi, Nagano 3990293, Japan.",furusawa.masahiro@exc.epson.co.jp,,,,,,27,262,265,5,113,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,6-Apr,2006,440,7085,,,,,783,786,,10.1038/nature04613,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,029GH,WOS:000236548400038,16598254,No,,,11/20/17

The response of Arctic surface temperatures to greenhouse gas thermal emission is modified by Northern Hemisphere synoptic meteorology and local radiative processes(2-4). Aerosols may play a contributing factor through changes to cloud radiative properties. Here we evaluate a previously suggested contribution of anthropogenic aerosols to cloud emission and surface temperatures in the Arctic(5-8). Using four years of ground-based aerosol and radiation measurements obtained near Barrow, Alaska, we show that, where thin water clouds and pollution are coincident, there is an increase in cloud longwave emissivity resulting from elevated haze levels. This results in an estimated surface warming under cloudy skies of between 3.3 and 5.2 W m(-2) or 1 and 1.6 degrees C. Arctic climate is closely tied to cloud longwave emission(2,4,9), but feedback mechanisms in the system are complex(10) and the actual climate response to the described sensitivity remains to be evaluated.","Univ Utah, Dept Meteorol, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA","Garrett, TJ (reprint author), Univ Utah, Dept Meteorol, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA.",tgarrett@met.utah.edu,"Zhao, Chuanfeng/G-8546-2013",,,,,30,117,119,0,30,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,6-Apr,2006,440,7085,,,,,787,789,,10.1038/nature04636,,3,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,029GH,WOS:000236548400039,16598255,No,,,11/20/17

Frequent workers are active year-round and together perform more than 95% of the total work of the colony, whereas infrequent workers typically perform less than 5% of the total work(3). Anecdotal evidence suggests that infrequent workers may act as dispersers, with dispersal being limited to comparatively rare periods when the soil is softened by moisture(4,5). Here we show that infrequent workers and queens increase their daily energy expenditure after rainfall whereas frequent workers do not. Infrequent workers are also fatter than frequent workers.

Here we find that the handedness of the embryonic gut and the adult gut and testes is reversed ( not randomized) in viable and fertile homozygous Myo31DF mutants. Myo31DF encodes an unconventional myosin, Drosophila MyoIA ( also referred to as MyoID in mammals; refs 3, 4), and is the first actin-based motor protein to be implicated in left - right patterning. We find that Myo31DF is required in the hindgut epithelium for normal embryonic handedness. Disruption of actin filaments in the hindgut epithelium randomizes the handedness of the embryonic gut, suggesting that Myo31DF function requires the actin cytoskeleton. Consistent with this, we find that Myo31DF colocalizes with the cytoskeleton. Overexpression of Myo61F, another myosin I ( ref. 4), reverses the handedness of the embryonic gut, and its knockdown also causes a left - right patterning defect. These two unconventional myosin I proteins may have antagonistic functions in left - right patterning.

However, the molecular nature of the determinant(s) responsible for the invariant orientation of the left - right axis ( situs choice) remains largely unknown. Mutations producing a complete reversal of left - right asymmetry ( situs inversus) are instrumental for identifying mechanisms controlling handedness, yet only one such mutation has been found in mice ( inversin)(5) and snails(6,7). Here we identify the conserved type ID unconventional myosin 31DF gene (Myo31DF) as a unique situs inversus locus in Drosophila. Myo31DF mutations reverse the dextral looping of genitalia, a prominent left - right marker in adult flies. Genetic mosaic analysis pinpoints the A8 segment of the genital disc as a left - right organizer and reveals an anterior - posterior compartmentalization of Myo31DF function that directs dextral development and represses a sinistral default state. As expected of a determinant, Myo31DF has a trigger-like function and is expressed symmetrically in the organizer, and its symmetrical overexpression does not impair left - right asymmetry. Thus Myo31DF is a dextral gene with actin-based motor activity controlling situs choice. Like mouse inversin(8), Myo31DF interacts and colocalizes with beta-catenin, suggesting that situs inversus genes can direct left - right development through the adherens junction.","Univ Nice, Inst Signalling Dev Biol & Canc, CNRS, UMR6543, F-06108 Nice 2, France; Hungarian Acad Sci, Biol Res Ctr, Inst Genet, H-6701 Szeged, Hungary","Noselli, S (reprint author), Univ Nice, Inst Signalling Dev Biol & Canc, CNRS, UMR6543, F-06108 Nice 2, France.",noselli@unice.fr,,"Noselli, stephane/0000-0002-7296-324X",,,,28,102,105,1,19,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,6-Apr,2006,440,7085,,,,,803,807,,10.1038/nature04623,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,029GH,WOS:000236548400043,16598259,No,,,11/20/17

This leads to the induction of immunity against invading pathogens or ;tolerance to peripheral self antigens, respectively(5-9). The outcome of antigen presentation by dendritic cells depends on their activation status, such that Toll-like receptor (TLR)-induced dendritic cell activation makes them immunogenic, whereas steady-state presentation of self antigens leads to tolerance(5,6,8,10). TLR-inducible expression of co-stimulatory signals is one of the mechanisms of self/ non-self discrimination(5,11). However, it is unclear whether or how the inducible expression of co-stimulatory signals would distinguish between self antigens and microbial antigens when both are encountered by dendritic cells during infection(6,8). Here we describe a new mechanism of antigen selection in dendritic cells for presentation by major histocompatibility complex class II molecules (MHCII) that is based on the origin of the antigen. We show that the efficiency of presenting antigens from phagocytosed cargo is dependent on the presence of TLR ligands within the cargo. Furthermore, we show that the generation of peptide - MHC class II complexes is controlled by TLRs in a strictly phagosome-autonomous manner.","Yale Univ, Sch Med, Immunobiol Sect, Howard Hughes Med Inst, New Haven, CT 06520 USA","Medzhitov, R (reprint author), Yale Univ, Sch Med, Immunobiol Sect, Howard Hughes Med Inst, 300 Cedar St, New Haven, CT 06520 USA.",ruslan.medzhitov@yale.edu,,,,,,30,532,543,2,46,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,6-Apr,2006,440,7085,,,,,808,812,,10.1038/nature04596,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,029GH,WOS:000236548400044,16489357,No,,,11/20/17

Arachidonic-acid-releasing phospholipases are highly enriched in nerve growth cones and have previously been implicated in neurite outgrowth(2,3). Cell membrane expansion is achieved through the fusion of transport organelles with the plasma membrane(4); however, the identity of the molecular target of arachidonic acid has remained elusive. Here we show that syntaxin 3 (STX3), a plasma membrane protein, has an important role in the growth of neurites, and also serves as a direct target for omega-6 arachidonic acid. By using syntaxin 3 in a screening assay, we determined that the dietary omega-3 linolenic and docosahexaenoic acids can efficiently substitute for arachidonic acid in activating syntaxin 3. Our findings provide a molecular basis for the previously established action of omega-3 and omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids in membrane expansion at the growth cones, and represent the first identification of a single effector molecule for these essential nutrients.","MRC, Mol Biol Lab, Cambridge CB2 2QH, England","Davletov, B (reprint author), MRC, Mol Biol Lab, Hills Rd, Cambridge CB2 2QH, England.",email@bazbek.com,,"Darios, Frederic/0000-0001-9800-5990",Medical Research Council [MC_U105178791],,,30,205,218,1,21,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,6-Apr,2006,440,7085,,,,,813,817,,10.1038/nature04598,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,029GH,WOS:000236548400045,16598260,No,,,11/20/17

Mutations affecting a number of slit diaphragm proteins, including nephrin ( encoded by NPHS1)(2), lead to renal disease owing to disruption of the filtration barrier and rearrangement of the actin cytoskeleton(3), although the molecular basis for this is unclear. Here we show that nephrin selectively binds the Src homology 2 (SH2)/SH3 domain-containing Nck adaptor proteins(4), which in turn control the podocyte cytoskeleton in vivo. The cytoplasmic tail of nephrin has multiple YDxV sites that form preferred bindingmotifs for the Nck SH2 domain once phosphorylated by Src-family kinases. We show that this Nck - nephrin interaction is required for nephrin-dependent actin reorganization. Selective deletion of Nck from podocytes of transgenic mice results in defects in the formation of foot processes and in congenital nephrotic syndrome. Together, these findings identify a physiological signalling pathway in which nephrin is linked through phosphotyrosine-based interactions to Nck adaptors, and thus to the underlying actin cytoskeleton in podocytes. Simple and widely expressed SH2/SH3 adaptor proteins can therefore direct the formation of a specialized cellular morphology in vivo.","Mt Sinai Hosp, Samuel Lunenfeld Res Inst, Toronto, ON M5G 1X5, Canada; Univ Toronto, Dept Mol & Med Genet, Toronto, ON M5S 1A8, Canada; Univ Toronto, Inst Med Sci, Toronto, ON M5S 1A8, Canada; McGill Univ Hlth Ctr, Dept Med, Montreal, PQ H3A 2B4, Canada; Univ Western Ontario, Dept Biochem, London, ON N6A 5C1, Canada; St Michaels Hosp, Div Nephrol, Toronto, ON M5B 1W8, Canada","Pawson, T (reprint author), Mt Sinai Hosp, Samuel Lunenfeld Res Inst, 600 Univ Ave, Toronto, ON M5G 1X5, Canada.",pawson@mshri.on.ca,"Pawson, Tony/E-4578-2013","Blasutig, Ivan/0000-0001-7310-2647",,,,30,276,287,1,12,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,6-Apr,2006,440,7085,,,,,818,823,,10.1038/nature04662,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,029GH,WOS:000236548400046,16525419,No,,,11/20/17

Telomere-binding proteins have crucial roles in controlling telomerase activity; however, little is known about their role in controlling semi-conservative replication, which synthesizes the bulk of telomeric DNA(1). Telomere repeats in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe are bound by Taz1, a regulator of diverse telomere functions(2-4). It is generally assumed that telomere-binding proteins impede replication fork progression. Here we show that, on the contrary, Taz1 is crucial for efficient replication fork progression through the telomere. Using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis(5), we find that loss of Taz1 leads to stalled replication forks at telomeres and internally placed telomere sequences, regardless of whether the telomeric G-rich strand is replicated by leading-or lagging-strand synthesis. In contrast, the Taz1-interacting protein Rap1 is dispensable for efficient telomeric fork progression. Upon loss of telomerase, taz1 Delta telomeres are lost precipitously, suggesting that maintenance of taz1 Delta telomere repeats cannot be sustained through semi-conservative replication. As the human telomere proteins TRF1 and TRF2 are Taz1 orthologues, we predict that one or both of the human TRFs may orchestrate fork passage through human telomeres. Stalled forks at dysfunctional human telomeres are likely to accelerate the genomic instability that drives tumorigenesis.","Canc Res UK, Telomere Biol Lab, London WC2A 3PX, England","Cooper, JP (reprint author), Canc Res UK, Telomere Biol Lab, 44 Lincolns Inn Fields, London WC2A 3PX, England.",julie.cooper@cancer.org.uk,,"Miller, Kyle/0000-0002-4544-0013",,,,28,153,153,0,11,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,6-Apr,2006,440,7085,,,,,824,828,,10.1038/nature04638,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,029GH,WOS:000236548400047,16598261,No,,,11/20/17

The resulting electrochemical proton gradient is used to power energy-requiring reactions, such as ATP synthesis. Cytochrome c oxidase is a key component of the respiratory chain, which harnesses dioxygen as a sink for electrons and links O-2 reduction to proton pumping(1). Electrons from cytochrome c are transferred sequentially to the O-2 reduction site of cytochrome c oxidase via two other metal centres, Cu-A and haem a, and this is coupled to vectorial proton transfer across the membrane by a hitherto unknown mechanism. On the basis of the kinetics of proton uptake and release on the two aqueous sides of the membrane, it was recently suggested that proton pumping by cytochrome c oxidase is not mechanistically coupled to internal electron transfer(2). Here we have monitored translocation of electrical charge equivalents as well as electron transfer within cytochrome c oxidase in real time. The results show that electron transfer from haem a to the O-2 reduction site initiates the proton pump mechanism by being kinetically linked to an internal vectorial proton transfer. This reaction drives the proton pump and occurs before relaxation steps in which protons are taken up from the aqueous space on one side of the membrane and released on the other(2).","Univ Helsinki, Helsinki Bioenerget Grp, Inst Biotechnol, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland","Wikstrom, M (reprint author), Univ Helsinki, Helsinki Bioenerget Grp, Inst Biotechnol, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland.",marten.wikstrom@helsinki.fi,"Wikstrom, Marten/A-4403-2008",,,,,29,166,168,2,53,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,6-Apr,2006,440,7085,,,,,829,832,,10.1038/nature04619,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,029GH,WOS:000236548400048,16598262,No,,,11/20/17

Here we determine crystal structures of the full-length Thermotoga maritima CorA in an apparent closed state and its isolated cytoplasmic domain at 3.9 angstrom and 1.85 angstrom resolution, respectively. The transporter is a funnel-shaped homopentamer with two transmembrane helices per monomer. The channel is formed by an inner group of five helices and putatively gated by bulky hydrophobic residues. The large cytoplasmic domain forms a funnel whose wide mouth points into the cell and whose walls are formed by five long helices that are extensions of the transmembrane helices. The cytoplasmic neck of the pore is surrounded, on the outside of the funnel, by a ring of highly conserved positively charged residues. Two negatively charged helices in the cytoplasmic domain extend back towards the membrane on the outside of the funnel and abut the ring of positive charge.

Any realistic model therefore requires a proper treatment of these processes, but hitherto this has been far from satisfactory(5). Here we report a simulation that follows evolution from the earliest stages of galaxy formation through the period of dynamical relaxation, at which point the resulting galaxy is in its final form. The bubble structures of gas revealed in our simulation (for times of less than 3 x 10(8) years) resemble closely high-red-shift Lyman-alpha emitters(6,7). After 10(9) years, these bodies are dominated by stellar continuum radiation and then resemble the Lyman break galaxies(8,9), which are high-redshift star-forming galaxies.

Other than the gap moons Pan and Daphnis ( the provisional name of S/2005 S1), which have sizes of several kilometres, no individual bodies in the rings have been directly observed, and the population of ring particles larger than ten metres has been essentially unknown. Here we report the observation of four longitudinal double-streaks in an otherwise bland part of the mid-A ring. We infer that these 'propeller'-shaped perturbations(3-5) arise from the effects of embedded moonlets approximately 40 to 120 m in diameter. Direct observation of this phenomenon validates models of proto-planetary disks in which similar processes are posited(4,6). A population of moonlets, as implied by the size distribution that we find, could help explain gaps in the more tenuous regions of the Cassini division and the C ring(7).

This well-known effect can, however, be dramatically changed if the potential captures several interacting particles. Here we demonstrate that the inter-particle interactions in a chain of repelling particles captured by a ratchet potential can, in a controllable way, lead to multiple drift reversals, with the drift sign alternating from positive to negative as the number of particles per ratchet period changes from odd to even. To demonstrate experimentally the validity of this very general prediction, we performed transport measurements on a. c.-driven vortices trapped in a superconductor by an array of nanometre-scale asymmetric traps. We found that the direction of the vortex drift does undergo multiple reversals as the vortex density is increased, in excellent agreement with the model predictions. This drastic change in the drift behaviour between single- and multiparticle systems can shed some light on the different behaviour of ratchets and biomembranes(4) in two drift regimes: diluted ( single particles) and concentrated ( interacting particles).","Katholieke Univ Leuven, INPAC, Nanoscale Superconduct & Magnetism Grp, B-3001 Louvain, Belgium","Moshchalkov, VV (reprint author), Katholieke Univ Leuven, INPAC, Nanoscale Superconduct & Magnetism Grp, Celestijnenlaan 200 D, B-3001 Louvain, Belgium.",Victor.Moshchalkov@fys.kuleuven.be,"de Souza Silva, Clecio/G-8640-2012; Moshchalkov, Victor/I-7232-2013",,,,,17,168,168,1,25,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,30-Mar,2006,440,7084,,,,,651,654,,10.1038/nature04595,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,026OY,WOS:000236350400039,16572166,No,,,11/20/17

Structure determination is more difficult if single crystals are not available(5). Many complex inorganic materials that are of interest in nanotechnology have no periodic long-range order and so their structures cannot be solved using crystallographic methods(6). Here we demonstrate that ab initio structure solution of these nanostructured materials is feasible using diffraction data in combination with distance geometry methods. Precise, sub-angstrom resolution distance data are experimentally available from the atomic pair distribution function (PDF)(6,7). Current PDF analysis consists of structure refinement from reasonable initial structure guesses(6,7) and it is not clear, a priori, that sufficient information exists in the PDF to obtain a unique structural solution. Here we present and validate two algorithms for structure reconstruction from precise unassigned interatomic distances for a range of clusters. We then apply the algorithms to find a unique, ab initio, structural solution for C-60 from PDF data alone.

Geophysical observations(4-6) indicate that melting beneath ridges begins at depths approaching 300 km, but the cause of this melting has remained unclear. Here we determine the solidus of carbonated peridotite from 3 to 10 GPa and demonstrate that melting beneath ridges may occur at depths up to 330 km, producing 0.03 - 0.3% carbonatite liquid. We argue that these melts promote recrystallization and realignment of the mineral matrix, which may explain the geophysical observations. Extraction of incipient carbonatite melts from deep within the oceanic mantle produces an abundant source of metasomatic fluids and a vast mantle residue depleted in highly incompatible elements and fractionated in key parent-daughter elements. We infer that carbon, helium, argon and highly incompatible heat-producing elements ( such as uranium, thorium and potassium) are efficiently scavenged from depths of similar to 200 - 330 km in the upper mantle.","Univ Minnesota, Dept Geol & Geophys, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA","Dasgupta, R (reprint author), Univ Minnesota, Dept Geol & Geophys, 30 Pillsbury Dr SE, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA.",dasg0007@umn.edu,"Dasgupta, Rajdeep/C-7252-2009; Hirschmann, marc/B-9455-2016","Dasgupta, Rajdeep/0000-0001-5392-415X; Hirschmann, marc/0000-0003-1213-6645",,,,33,247,269,7,84,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,30-Mar,2006,440,7084,,,,,659,662,,10.1038/nature04612,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,026OY,WOS:000236350400041,16572168,No,,,11/20/17

The paradox is resolved if many interactions are with related individuals so that the benefits of altruism are reaped by copies of the altruistic gene in other individuals(1), a mechanism called kin selection(2). However, recognition of altruists could provide an alternative route towards the evolution of altruism(1,3-5). Arguably the simplest recognition system is a conspicuous, heritable tag, such as a green beard(1,3). Despite the fact that such genes have been reported(6-8), the 'green beard effect'(3) has often been dismissed because it is unlikely that a single gene can code for altruism and a recognizable tag(1,3,9). Here we model the green beard effect and find that if recognition and altruism are always inherited together, the dynamics are highly unstable, leading to the loss of altruism. In contrast, if the effect is caused by loosely coupled separate genes, altruism is facilitated through beard chromodynamics in which many beard colours co-occur. This allows altruism to persist even in weakly structured populations and implies that the green beard effect, in the form of a fluid association of altruistic traits with a recognition tag, can be much more prevalent than hitherto assumed.","Univ London Royal Holloway & Bedford New Coll, Sch Biol Sci, Egham TW20 0EX, Surrey, England; Univ Paris 06, CNRS, UMR 7625, Lab Ecol ENS, F-75252 Paris 05, France","Jansen, VAA (reprint author), Univ London Royal Holloway & Bedford New Coll, Sch Biol Sci, Egham TW20 0EX, Surrey, England.",vincent.jansen@rhul.ac.uk; minus.van.baalen@ens.fr,"Jansen , Vincent/C-8353-2009; van Baalen, Minus/J-9285-2012","van Baalen, Minus/0000-0002-3713-5967; Jansen, Vincent A.A./0000-0002-6518-2090",,,,20,156,162,2,42,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,30-Mar,2006,440,7084,,,,,663,666,,10.1038/nature04387,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,026OY,WOS:000236350400042,16572169,No,,,11/20/17

Can the reverse also be done? Here we consider this issue by modelling evolution of the reduced genomes of endosymbiotic bacteria. The diversity of gene content in these bacteria may reflect both variation in selective forces and contingency-dependent loss of alternative pathways. Using an in silico representation of the metabolic network of Escherichia coli, we examine the role of contingency by repeatedly simulating the successive loss of genes while controlling for the environment. The minimal networks that result are variable in both gene content and number. Partially different metabolisms can thus evolve owing to contingency alone. The simulation outcomes do preserve a core metabolism, however, which is over-represented in strict intracellular bacteria. Moreover, differences between minimal networks based on lifestyle are predictable: by simulating their respective environmental conditions, we can model evolution of the gene content in Buchnera aphidicola and Wigglesworthia glossinidia with over 80% accuracy. We conclude that, at least for the particular cases considered here, gene content of an organism can be predicted with knowledge of its distant ancestors and its current lifestyle.","Univ Bath, Dept Biol & Biochem, Bath BA2 7AY, Avon, England; European Mol Biol Lab, D-69012 Heidelberg, Germany; Univ Oxford, Dept Zool, Oxford OX1 3PS, England; Univ Manchester, Fac Life Sci, Manchester M13 9PT, Lancs, England; Semmelweis Univ, Dept Med Chem, H-1444 Budapest, Hungary","Hurst, LD (reprint author), Univ Bath, Dept Biol & Biochem, Claverton Down, Bath BA2 7AY, Avon, England.",l.d.hurst@bath.ac.uk,"Hurst, Laurence/F-9215-2010; Lercher, Martin/K-7939-2013; Csermely, Peter/J-2067-2017","Hurst, Laurence/0000-0002-1002-1054; Lercher, Martin/0000-0003-3940-1621; Csermely, Peter/0000-0001-9234-0659; Papp, Balazs/0000-0003-3093-8852",,,,30,143,150,2,26,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,30-Mar,2006,440,7084,,,,,667,670,,10.1038/nature04568,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,026OY,WOS:000236350400043,16572170,No,,,11/20/17

As chromosome 15 is one of seven human chromosomes with a high rate of segmental duplication(1), we have carried out a detailed analysis of the duplication structure of the chromosome. Segmental duplications in chromosome 15 are largely clustered in two regions, on proximal and distal 15q; the proximal region is notable because recombination among the segmental duplications can result in deletions causing Prader-Willi and Angelman syndromes(2,3). Sequence analysis shows that the proximal and distal regions of 15q share extensive ancient similarity(4). Using a simple approach, we have been able to reconstruct many of the events by which the current duplication structure arose. We find that most of the intrachromosomal duplications seem to share a common ancestry.

Here we demonstrate that the trajectory of change in the thickness of the cerebral cortex, rather than cortical thickness itself, is most closely related to level of intelligence. Using a longitudinal design, we find a marked developmental shift from a predominantly negative correlation between intelligence and cortical thickness in early childhood to a positive correlation in late childhood and beyond. Additionally, level of intelligence is associated with the trajectory of cortical development, primarily in frontal regions implicated in the maturation of intelligent activity(4,5). More intelligent children demonstrate a particularly plastic cortex, with an initial accelerated and prolonged phase of cortical increase, which yields to equally vigorous cortical thinning by early adolescence.

Reactivation of temporally sequenced memories for previous behavioural experiences has been reported in sleep in rats(7,8).

Despite extensive genetic and behavioural analyses that have led to the identification of many genes and neural circuits involved in regulating C. elegans locomotion behaviour(1), it remains unclear whether and how somatosensory feedback modulates motor output during locomotion. In particular, no stretch receptors have been identified in C. elegans, raising the issue of whether stretch-receptor-mediated proprioception is used by C. elegans to regulate its locomotion behaviour. Here we have characterized TRP-4, the C. elegans homologue of the mechanosensitive TRPN channel. We show that trp-4 mutant worms bend their body abnormally, exhibiting a body posture distinct from that of wild-type worms during locomotion, suggesting that TRP-4 is involved in stretch-receptor-mediated proprioception. We show that TRP-4 acts in a single neuron, DVA, to mediate its function in proprioception, and that the activity of DVA can be stimulated by body stretch. DVA both positively and negatively modulates locomotion, providing a unique mechanism whereby a single neuron can fine-tune motor activity. Thus, DVA represents a stretch receptor neuron that regulates sensory - motor integration during C. elegans locomotion.","Univ Michigan, Inst Life Sci, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; Univ Michigan, Sch Med, Dept Mol & Integrat Physiol, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; CALTECH, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA; CALTECH, Div Biol, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA","Xu, XZS (reprint author), Univ Michigan, Inst Life Sci, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",shawnxu@umich.edu,,"Sternberg, Paul/0000-0002-7699-0173","NIGMS NIH HHS [R01 GM078276, R01 GM078276-01]",,,21,142,159,0,21,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,30-Mar,2006,440,7084,,,,,684,687,,10.1038/nature04538,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,026OY,WOS:000236350400047,16572173,No,,,11/20/17

Since the late nineteenth century, it has been thought that the microenvironment of the local host tissue actively participates in the propensity of certain cancers to metastasize to specific organs, and that bone provides an especially fertile 'soil' 4. In the case of breast cancers, the local chemokine milieu is now emerging as an explanation for why these tumours preferentially metastasize to certain organs(5). However, as the inhibition of chemokine receptors in vivo only partially blocks metastatic behaviour(6), other factors must exist that regulate the preferential metastasis of breast cancer cells. Here we show that the cytokine RANKL ( receptor activator of NF-kappa B ligand)(7,8) triggers migration of human epithelial cancer cells and melanoma cells that express the receptor RANK. RANK is expressed on cancer cell lines and breast cancer cells in patients. In a mouse model of melanoma metastasis(9), in vivo neutralization of RANKL by osteoprotegerin results in complete protection from paralysis and a marked reduction in tumour burden in bones but not in other organs. Our data show that local differentiation factors such as RANKL have an important role in cell migration and the tissue-specific metastatic behaviour of cancer cells.","Austrian Acad Sci, IMBA, Inst Mol Biotechnol, A-1030 Vienna, Austria; Univ Toronto, Dept Med Biophys, Toronto, ON M5G 2C1, Canada; Univ Toronto, Dept Immunol, Toronto, ON M5G 2C1, Canada; Univ Hlth Network, Ontario Canc Inst, Toronto, ON M5G 2C1, Canada; McGill Univ, Fac Dent, Montreal, PQ H3A 1A4, Canada; Amgen Inc, Thousand Oaks, CA 91320 USA; Pohang Univ Sci & Technol, Div Mol & Life Sci, Pohang 790784, South Korea; Med Univ Vienna, Dept Obstet & Gynecol, A-1090 Vienna, Austria; Univ Western Ontario, Dept Physiol & Pharmacol, CIHR Grp Skeletal Dev & Remodeling, London, ON N6A 5C1, Canada; Univ Western Ontario, Div Oral Biol, Schulich Sch Med & Dent, London, ON N6A 5C1, Canada","Penninger, JM (reprint author), Austrian Acad Sci, IMBA, Inst Mol Biotechnol, Dr Bohr Gasse 3, A-1030 Vienna, Austria.",josef.penninger@imba.oeaw.ac.at,"Schreiber, Martin/F-2175-2013; Sims, Stephen/G-4510-2013; Dixon, S./G-3657-2013; Penninger, Josef/I-6860-2013","Schreiber, Martin/0000-0003-1102-7789; Dixon, S./0000-0001-9162-1686; Penninger, Josef/0000-0002-8194-3777",,,,22,413,437,5,63,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,30-Mar,2006,440,7084,,,,,692,696,,10.1038/nature04524,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,026OY,WOS:000236350400049,16572175,No,,,11/20/17

The Ran importin-beta system also functions in mitotic spindle assembly and nuclear pore and nuclear envelope formation(1,3,4). The common principle underlying these diverse functions throughout the cell cycle is thought to be anisotropy of the distribution of RanGTP ( the RanGTP gradient), driven by the chromatin-associated guanine nucleotide exchange factor RCC1 ( refs 1, 4, 5). However, the existence and function of a RanGTP gradient during mitosis in cells is unclear. Here we examine the Ran - importin-beta system in cells by conventional and fluorescence lifetime microscopy using a biosensor, termed Rango, that increases its fluorescence resonance energy transfer signal when released from importin-beta by RanGTP. Rango is predominantly free in mitotic cells, but is further liberated around mitotic chromatin. In vitro experiments and modelling show that this localized increase of free cargoes corresponds to changes in RanGTP concentration sufficient to stabilize microtubules in extracts. In cells, the Ran - importin- beta - cargo gradient kinetically promotes spindle formation but is largely dispensable once the spindle has been established. Consistent with previous reports(6-8), we observe that the Ran system also affects spindle pole formation and chromosome congression in vivo. Our results demonstrate that conserved Ran-regulated pathways are involved in multiple, parallel processes required for spindle function, but that their relative contribution differs in chromatin-versus centrosome/ kinetochore-driven spindle assembly systems.","Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mol & Cell Biol, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA","Heald, R (reprint author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mol & Cell Biol, 229 Stanley Hall, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",heald@socrates.berkeley.edu; kweis@berkeley.edu,"Weis, Karsten/F-5719-2011; Kalab, Petr/B-2478-2009; Pralle, Arnd/M-9832-2013","Weis, Karsten/0000-0001-7224-925X; Pralle, Arnd/0000-0002-6079-109X; Heald, Rebecca/0000-0001-6671-6528",,,,18,222,228,0,16,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,30-Mar,2006,440,7084,,,,,697,701,,10.1038/nature04589,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,026OY,WOS:000236350400050,16572176,No,,,11/20/17

However, little is known about the mechanisms that govern the expression of this locus. Here we have identified a putative DNA replication origin at the INK4/ARF locus that assembles a multiprotein complex containing Cdc6, Orc2 and MCMs, and that coincides with a conserved noncoding DNA element ( regulatory domain RDINK4/ARF). Targeted and localized RNA-interference-induced heterochromatinization of RDINK4/ARF results in transcriptional repression of the locus, revealing that RDINK4/ARF is a relevant transcriptional regulatory element. Cdc6 is overexpressed in human cancers, where it might have roles in addition to DNA replication(3-5). We have found that high levels of Cdc6 result in RDINK4/ARF-dependent transcriptional repression, recruitment of histone deacetylases and heterochromatinization of the INK4/ARF locus, and a concomitant decrease in the expression of the three tumour suppressors encoded by this locus. This mechanism is reminiscent of the silencing of the mating-type HM loci in yeast by replication factors(6). Consistent with its ability to repress the INK4/ARF locus, Cdc6 has cellular immortalization activity and neoplastic transformation capacity in cooperation with oncogenic Ras. Furthermore, human lung carcinomas with high levels of Cdc6 are associated with low levels of p16(INK4a). We conclude that aberrant expression of Cdc6 is oncogenic by directly repressing the INK4/ARF locus through the RDINK4/ARF element.","Spanish Natl Canc Res Ctr CNIO, Tumor Suppress Grp, E-28029 Madrid, Spain; Spanish Natl Canc Res Ctr CNIO, Lung Canc Grp, E-28029 Madrid, Spain; Spanish Natl Canc Res Ctr CNIO, DNA Replicat Grp, E-28029 Madrid, Spain; Univ Salamanca, CSIC, Inst Microbiol Bioquim, E-37007 Salamanca, Spain; Hosp Univ 12 Octubre, Dept Anat Patol, E-28041 Madrid, Spain","Serrano, M (reprint author), Spanish Natl Canc Res Ctr CNIO, Tumor Suppress Grp, E-28029 Madrid, Spain.",mserrano@cnio.es,"Sanchez-Cespedes, Montse/H-8485-2012; Mendez, Juan/K-8001-2014; Serrano, Manuel/H-2634-2015; Gonzalez, Susana/I-3154-2015; Antequera, Francisco/B-1115-2017","Sanchez-Cespedes, Montse/0000-0002-6045-5627; Mendez, Juan/0000-0002-3235-2559; Serrano, Manuel/0000-0001-7177-9312; Gonzalez, Susana/0000-0002-7443-6195; Antequera, Francisco/0000-0003-2623-4131",,,,28,134,139,3,12,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,30-Mar,2006,440,7084,,,,,702,706,,10.1038/nature04585,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,026OY,WOS:000236350400051,16572177,No,,,11/20/17

Palaeorecords provide contradictory evidence about marine productivity in this region, but beyond one glacial cycle, data were sparse. Here we present continuous chemical proxy data spanning the last eight glacial cycles (740,000 years) from the Dome C Antarctic ice core. These data constrain winter sea-ice extent in the Indian Ocean, Southern Ocean biogenic productivity and Patagonian climatic conditions. We found that maximum sea-ice extent is closely tied to Antarctic temperature on multi-millennial timescales, but less so on shorter timescales. Biological dimethylsulphide emissions south of the polar front seem to have changed little with climate, suggesting that sulphur compounds were not active in climate regulation. We observe large glacial-interglacial contrasts in iron deposition, which we infer reflects strongly changing Patagonian conditions. During glacial terminations, changes in Patagonia apparently preceded sea-ice reduction, indicating that multiple mechanisms may be responsible for different phases of CO2 increase during glacial terminations. We observe no changes in internal climatic feedbacks that could have caused the change in amplitude of Antarctic temperature variations observed 440,000 years ago.","British Antarctic Survey, Cambridge CB3 0ET, England; Alfred Wegener Inst Polar & Marine Res, D-27568 Bremerhaven, Germany; Lab Glaciol & Geophys Environm, F-38402 St Martin Dheres, France; Stockholm Univ, Dept Phys Geog & Quaternary Geol, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden; Univ Bern, Inst Phys, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland; Univ Copenhagen, Dept Geophys, DK-2100 Copenhagen O, Denmark; Univ Florence, Dept Chem, Analyt Chem Sect, I-50019 Florence, Italy; Heidelberg Univ, Inst Umweltphys, D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany; Univ Venice, Dept Environm Sci, I-30123 Venice, Italy; Univ Venice, CNR, Inst Dynam Environm Proc, I-30123 Venice, Italy","Wolff, EW (reprint author), British Antarctic Survey, High Cross,Madingley Rd, Cambridge CB3 0ET, England.",ewwo@bas.ac.uk,"; Fundel, Felix/C-5469-2009; Mulvaney, Robert/K-3929-2012; Fischer, Hubertus/A-1211-2014; Stocker, Thomas/B-1273-2013; Wolff, Eric/D-7925-2014; Lambert, Fabrice/M-2003-2014; Jonsell, Ulf/F-3116-2015; Udisti, Roberto/M-7966-2015; Severi, Mirko/J-2508-2012","Steffensen, Jorgen Peder/0000-0002-5516-1093; Mulvaney, Robert/0000-0002-5372-8148; Fischer, Hubertus/0000-0002-2787-4221; Wolff, Eric/0000-0002-5914-8531; Lambert, Fabrice/0000-0002-2192-024X; Jonsell, Ulf/0000-0001-6532-8590; Udisti, Roberto/0000-0003-4440-8238; Severi, Mirko/0000-0003-1511-6762; Becagli, Silvia/0000-0003-3633-4849",,,,50,286,294,4,83,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,23-Mar,2006,440,7083,,,,,491,496,,10.1038/nature04614,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,024DV,WOS:000236176100047,16554810,No,,,11/20/17

First, there is significant ultraviolet emission(1) from Lyman break galaxies (LBGs) at wavelengths shorter than 912 angstrom. Second, there is strong Lyman alpha emission(2) from extended 'blobs' with little or no associated apparent ionizing continuum. Third, there is a population of galaxies with unusually strong Lyman alpha emission lines(3). And fourth, there is a strong He II (1,640 angstrom) emission line(4) in a composite of LBGs. The proposed explanations for the first three observations are internally inconsistent, and the fourth puzzle has remained hitherto unexplained. Here we show that all four problems are resolved simultaneously if 10-30 per cent of the stars in many galaxies at z approximate to 3-4 are mainly primordial-unenriched by elements heavier than helium ('metals'). Most models of hierarchical galaxy formation assume efficient intragalactic metal mixing, and therefore do not predict(5-9) metal-free star formation at redshifts significantly below z approximate to 5.

Indirect evidence comes from high pulsar velocities(1), associations of supernovae with long-soft gamma-ray bursts(2,3), and asymmetries in late-time emission-line profiles(4). Spectropolarimetry provides a direct probe of young supernova geometry, with higher polarization generally indicating a greater departure from spherical symmetry(5,6). Large polarizations have been measured for 'stripped-envelope' (that is, type Ic; ref. 7) supernovae, which confirms their non-spherical morphology(8,9); but the explosions of massive stars with intact hydrogen envelopes(7,10) (type II-P supernovae) have shown only weak polarizations at the early times observed(11,12). Here we report multi-epoch spectropolarimetry of a classic type II-P supernova that reveals the abrupt appearance of significant polarization when the inner core is first exposed in the thinning ejecta (similar to 90 days after explosion). We infer a departure from spherical symmetry of at least 30 per cent for the inner ejecta. Combined with earlier results, this suggests that a strongly non-spherical explosion may be a generic feature of core-collapse supernovae of all types, where the asphericity in type II-P supernovae is cloaked at early times by the massive, opaque, hydrogen envelope.","CALTECH, Dept Astron, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA; Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Astron, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA","Leonard, DC (reprint author), San Diego State Univ, Dept Astron, San Diego, CA 92182 USA.",leonard@sciences.sdsu.edu,,"Hoffman, Jennifer/0000-0003-1495-2275",,,,30,108,109,0,3,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,23-Mar,2006,440,7083,,,,,505,507,,10.1038/nature04558,,3,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,024DV,WOS:000236176100050,16554813,No,,,11/20/17

The main approach to circumvent this problem is to exploit the hybrid nature of surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs), which are light waves coupled to free electron oscillations in a metal(1,2) that can be laterally confined below the diffraction limit using subwavelength metal structures(3-8). However, the simultaneous realization of strong confinement and a propagation loss sufficiently low for practical applications has long been out of reach. Channel SPP modes-channel plasmon polaritons (CPPs)(8)-are electromagnetic waves that are bound to and propagate along the bottom of V-shaped grooves milled in a metal film. They are expected to exhibit useful subwavelength confinement, relatively low propagation loss(9), single-mode operation(10) and efficient transmission around sharp bends(11). Our previous experiments showed that CPPs do exist and that they propagate over tens of micrometres along straight subwavelength grooves(12). Here we report the design, fabrication and characterization of CPP-based subwavelength waveguide components operating at telecom wavelengths: Y-splitters, Mach-Zehnder interferometers and waveguide-ring resonators. We demonstrate that CPP guides can indeed be used for large-angle bending and splitting of radiation, thereby enabling the realization of ultracompact plasmonic components and paving the way for a new class of integrated optical circuits.","Univ Aalborg, Dept Phys & Nanotechnol, DK-9220 Aalborg, Denmark; Univ Strasbourg 1, ISIS, CNRS, UMR 7006, F-67083 Strasbourg, France","Bozhevolnyi, SI (reprint author), Univ Aalborg, Dept Phys & Nanotechnol, Skjernvej 4A, DK-9220 Aalborg, Denmark.",sergey@physics.aau.dk,"Bozhevolnyi, Sergey/E-9423-2011; Volkov, Valentyn/M-5489-2013","Bozhevolnyi, Sergey/0000-0002-0393-4859; Volkov, Valentyn/0000-0003-2637-1371",,,,16,1497,1533,51,642,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,23-Mar,2006,440,7083,,,,,508,511,,10.1038/nature04594,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,024DV,WOS:000236176100051,16554814,No,,,11/20/17

But these 'molecular machines' have not yet been used to mechanically manipulate a second molecule in a controlled and reversible manner. Here we show that light-induced scissor-like conformational changes of one molecule(5) can give rise to mechanical twisting of a non-covalently bound guest molecule. To realize this coupling of molecular motions, we use a previously designed system(5): a ferrocene moiety with an azobenzene strap, each end of which is attached to one of the two cyclopentadienyl rings of the ferrocene unit, acts as a pivot so that photoisomerization of the strap rotates the ferrocene rings relative to each other and thereby also changes the relative position of two 'pedal' moieties attached to the ferrocene rings. We translate this effect into intermolecular coupling of motion by endowing the pedals with binding sites, which allow the host system to form a stable complex with a bidentate rotor molecule. Using circular dichroism spectroscopy, we show that the photoinduced conformational changes of the host are indeed transmitted and induce mechanical twisting of the rotor molecule. This design concept, which significantly extends the successful coupling of motion beyond the intramolecular level seen in synthetic allosteric receptors(12), might allow for the remote control of molecular events in larger interlocked molecular systems.","Univ Tokyo, Sch Engn, Dept Chem & Biotechnol, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo 1138656, Japan; Univ Tokyo, Ctr NanoBio Integrat, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo 1138656, Japan; Japan Sci Technol Agcy, PRESTO, Kawaguchi, Saitama 3320012, Japan","Kinbara, K (reprint author), Univ Tokyo, Sch Engn, Dept Chem & Biotechnol, Bunkyo Ku, 7-3-1 Hongo, Tokyo 1138656, Japan.",kinbara@macro.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp,"Aida, Takuzo/I-9117-2012; Muraoka, Takahiro/C-6262-2017; Kinbara, Kazushi/E-6347-2017","Muraoka, Takahiro/0000-0001-6744-048X; Kinbara, Kazushi/0000-0002-5945-9612",,,,22,426,429,10,177,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,23-Mar,2006,440,7083,,,,,512,515,,10.1038/nature04635,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,024DV,WOS:000236176100052,16554815,No,,,11/20/17

Nevertheless, no direct geological evidence has hitherto been available in support of the existence of methanogens in the Archaean period, although circumstantial evidence is available in the form of similar to 2.8-Gyr-old carbon-isotope-depleted kerogen(3). Here we report crushing extraction and carbon isotope analysis of methane-bearing fluid inclusions in similar to 3.5-Gyr-old hydrothermal precipitates from Pilbara craton, Australia. Our results indicate that the extracted fluids contain microbial methane with carbon isotopic compositions of less than -56 parts per thousand included within original precipitates.

In the face of this growing pressure, a comprehensive conservation strategy for the Amazon basin should protect its watersheds, the full range of species and ecosystem diversity, and the stability of regional climates. Here we report that protected areas in the Amazon basin-the central feature of prevailing conservation approaches(5-8)-are an important but insufficient component of this strategy, based on policy-sensitive simulations of future deforestation. By 2050, current trends in agricultural expansion will eliminate a total of 40% of Amazon forests, including at least two-thirds of the forest cover of six major watersheds and 12 ecoregions, releasing 32 +/- 8 Pg of carbon to the atmosphere. One-quarter of the 382 mammalian species examined will lose more than 40% of the forest within their Amazon ranges. Although an expanded and enforced network of protected areas could avoid as much as one-third of this projected forest loss, conservation on private lands is also essential. Expanding market pressures for sound land management and prevention of forest clearing on lands unsuitable for agriculture are critical ingredients of a strategy for comprehensive conservation(3,4).","Univ Fed Minas Gerais, Ctr Sensoriamento Remoto, BR-31270901 Belo Horizonte, MG, Brazil; Univ Fed Minas Gerais, Ctr Desenvolvimento & Planejamento Reg, BR-31270901 Belo Horizonte, MG, Brazil; Woods Hole Res Ctr, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA; Yale Univ, Sch Forestry & Environm Studies, Trop Resources Inst, New Haven, CT 06511 USA; Inst Pesquisa Ambiental Amazonia, BR-66035170 Belem, Para, Brazil; Fed Univ Para, Nucleo Altos Estudos Amazon, BR-66075110 Belem, Para, Brazil","Soares, BS (reprint author), Univ Fed Minas Gerais, Ctr Sensoriamento Remoto, Av Antonio Carlos 6627, BR-31270901 Belo Horizonte, MG, Brazil.",britaldo@csr.ufmg.br; dnepstad@whrc.org,,"Curran, Lisa M./0000-0002-2813-5578",,,,28,552,579,12,229,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,23-Mar,2006,440,7083,,,,,520,523,,10.1038/nature04389,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,024DV,WOS:000236176100054,16554817,No,,,11/20/17

However, the discreteness of plant species and their correspondence with reproductive communities have not been tested quantitatively, allowing zoologists to argue that botanists have been overly influenced by a few 'botanical horror stories', such as dandelions, blackberries and oaks(6,7). Here we analyse phenetic and/or crossing relationships in over 400 genera of plants and animals. We show that although discrete phenotypic clusters exist in most genera (>80%), the correspondence of taxonomic species to these clusters is poor (<60%) and no different between plants and animals. Lack of congruence is caused by polyploidy, asexual reproduction and over-differentiation by taxonomists, but not by contemporary hybridization. Nonetheless, crossability data indicate that 70% of taxonomic species and 75% of phenotypic clusters in plants correspond to reproductively independent lineages (as measured by postmating isolation), and thus represent biologically real entities. Contrary to conventional wisdom(8), plant species are more likely than animal species to represent reproductively independent lineages.","Indiana Univ, Dept Biol, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA","Rieseberg, LH (reprint author), Indiana Univ, Dept Biol, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA.",lriesebe@indiana.edu,"Wood, Troy/F-7302-2010; Rieseberg, Loren/B-3591-2013","Rieseberg, Loren/0000-0002-2712-2417",NIGMS NIH HHS [R01 GM059065-06],,,30,134,147,5,90,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,23-Mar,2006,440,7083,,,,,524,527,,10.1038/nature04402,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,024DV,WOS:000236176100055,16554818,No,,,11/20/17

Phosphorylation of tau and APP on certain serine or threonine residues preceding proline affects tangle formation and A beta production in vitro(3-5). Phosphorylated Ser/Thr-Pro motifs in peptides can exist in cis or trans conformations, the conversion of which is catalysed by the Pin1 prolyl isomerase(6,7). Pin1 has been proposed to regulate protein function by accelerating conformational changes(7-10), but such activity has never been visualized and the biological and pathological significance of Pin1 substrate conformations is unknown(7). Notably, Pin1 is downregulated and/or inhibited by oxidation in Alzheimer's disease neurons, Pin1 knockout causes tauopathy and neurodegeneration(8,9,11,12), and Pin1 promoter polymorphisms appear to associate with reduced Pin1 levels and increased risk for late-onset Alzheimer's disease(13,14). However, the role of Pin1 in APP processing and A beta production is unknown. Here we show that Pin1 has profound effects on APP processing and A beta production. We find that Pin1 binds to the phosphorylated Thr 668-Pro motif in APP and accelerates its isomerization by over 1,000-fold, regulating the APP intracellular domain between two conformations, as visualized by NMR. Whereas Pin1 overexpression reduces A beta secretion from cell cultures, knockout of Pin1 increases its secretion. Pin1 knockout alone or in combination with overexpression of mutant APP in mice increases amyloidogenic APP processing and selectively elevates insoluble A beta 42 (a major toxic species) in brains in an age-dependent manner, with A beta 42 being prominently localized to multivesicular bodies of neurons, as shown in Alzheimer's disease before plaque pathology(15). Thus, Pin1-catalysed prolyl isomerization is a novel mechanism to regulate APP processing and A beta production, and its deregulation may link both tangle and plaque pathologies. These findings provide new insight into the pathogenesis and treatment of Alzheimer's disease.","Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Beth Israel Deaconess Med Ctr, Dept Med,Canc Biol Program, Boston, MA 02215 USA; Kaohsiung Vet Gen Hosp, Dept Med Educ & Res, Kaohsiung 804, Taiwan; Emory Univ, Dept Human Genet, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA; Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Brigham & Womens Hosp, Ctr Neurol Dis, Boston, MA 02115 USA; Cornell Univ, Dept Mol Biol & Genet, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA","Lu, KP (reprint author), Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Beth Israel Deaconess Med Ctr, Dept Med,Canc Biol Program, Boston, MA 02215 USA.",klu@bidmc.harvard.edu,"Balastik, Martin/C-4410-2014; xia, weiming/E-5465-2016","xia, weiming/0000-0002-7463-3295",NIA NIH HHS [R01 AG029385],,,30,305,317,1,31,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,23-Mar,2006,440,7083,,,,,528,534,,10.1038/nature04543,,7,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,024DV,WOS:000236176100056,16554819,No,,,11/20/17

Here we report the characterization of a P-type ATPase-encoding gene, MgAPT2, in the economically important rice blast pathogen Magnaporthe grisea, which is required for exocytosis during plant infection. Targeted gene replacement showed that MgAPT2 is required for both foliar and root infection by the fungus, and for the rapid induction of host defence responses in an incompatible reaction. Delta Mgapt2 mutants are impaired in the secretion of a range of extracellular enzymes and accumulate abnormal Golgi-like cisternae. However, the loss of MgAPT2 does not significantly affect hyphal growth or sporulation, indicating that the establishment of rice blast disease involves the use of MgApt2-dependent exocytotic processes that operate during plant infection.","Univ Exeter, Sch Biosci, Washington Singer Labs, Exeter EX4 4QG, Devon, England","Talbot, NJ (reprint author), Univ Exeter, Sch Biosci, Washington Singer Labs, Perry Rd, Exeter EX4 4QG, Devon, England.",n.j.talbot@exeter.ac.uk,"Talbot, Nicholas/I-9584-2014","Talbot, Nicholas/0000-0001-6434-7757",,,,28,66,74,1,12,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,23-Mar,2006,440,7083,,,,,535,539,,10.1038/nature04567,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,024DV,WOS:000236176100057,16554820,No,,,11/20/17

During immune responses, the egress process can be shut down transiently(1). When this occurs locally it increases lymphocyte numbers in the responding lymphoid organ; when it occurs systemically it can lead to immunosuppression as a result of the depletion of recirculating lymphocytes. Several mediators of the innate immune system are known to cause shutdown, including interferon alpha/beta (IFN-alpha/beta) and tumour necrosis factor(2-5), but the mechanism has been unclear. Here we show that treatment with the IFN-alpha/beta inducer polyinosine polycytidylic acid (hereafter 'poly(I:C)') inhibited egress by a mechanism that was partly lymphocyte-intrinsic. The transmembrane C-type lectin CD69 was rapidly induced and CD69(-/-) cells were poorly retained in lymphoid tissues after treatment with poly(I:C) or infection with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus. Lymphocyte egress requires sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor-1 (S1P(1)), and IFN-alpha/beta was found to inhibit lymphocyte responsiveness to S1P. By contrast, CD69(-/-) cells retained S1P(1) function after exposure to IFN-alpha/beta. In coexpression experiments, CD69 inhibited S1P(1) chemotactic function and led to downmodulation of S1P(1). In a reporter assay, S1P(1) crosslinking led to co-crosslinking and activation of a CD69-CD3 zeta chimaera. CD69 co-immunoprecipitated with S1P(1) but not the related receptor, S1P(3). These observations indicate that CD69 forms a complex with and negatively regulates S1P(1) and that it functions downstream of IFN-alpha/beta, and possibly other activating stimuli, to promote lymphocyte retention in lymphoid organs.","Univ Calif San Francisco, Howard Hughes Med Inst, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Microbiol & Immunol, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Med, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; Univ Calif San Francisco, Biomed Sci Grad Program, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA","Cyster, JG (reprint author), Univ Calif San Francisco, Howard Hughes Med Inst, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA.",jason.cyster@ucsf.edu; mehrdad.matloubian@ucsf.edu,,,,,,30,491,498,2,19,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,23-Mar,2006,440,7083,,,,,540,544,,10.1038/nature04606,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,024DV,WOS:000236176100058,16525420,No,,,11/20/17

In such systems individual cells can switch to an alternative state and, after some time, switch back again. In Bacillus subtilis, competence is an example of such a transiently differentiated state associated with the capability for DNA uptake from the environment. Individual genes and proteins underlying differentiation into the competent state have been identified(4,5), but it has been unclear how these genes interact dynamically in individual cells to control both spontaneous entry into competence and return to vegetative growth. Here we show that this behaviour can be understood in terms of excitability in the underlying genetic circuit. Using quantitative fluorescence time-lapse microscopy, we directly observed the activities of multiple circuit components simultaneously in individual cells, and analysed the resulting data in terms of a mathematical model. We find that an excitable core module containing positive and negative feedback loops can explain both entry into, and exit from, the competent state. We further tested this model by analysing initiation in sister cells, and by re-engineering the gene circuit to specifically block exit. Excitable dynamics driven by noise naturally generate stochastic and transient responses(6), thereby providing an ideal mechanism for competence regulation.","CALTECH, Div Biol, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA; CALTECH, Dept Appl Phys, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA; Univ Politecn Catalunya, Dept Fis & Engn Nucl, E-08222 Terrassa, Spain","Elowitz, MB (reprint author), CALTECH, Div Biol, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA.",melowitz@caltech.edu,"Garcia-Ojalvo, Jordi/A-4574-2009","Garcia-Ojalvo, Jordi/0000-0002-3716-7520",,,,24,420,429,1,32,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,23-Mar,2006,440,7083,,,,,545,550,,10.1038/nature04588,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,024DV,WOS:000236176100059,16554821,No,,,11/20/17

Hsp70 is one of the most highly inducible molecular chaperones, but its expression must be maintained at low levels under physiological conditions to permit constitutive cellular activities to proceed(3,4). Heat shock transcription factor 1 (HSF1) is the transcriptional regulator of HSP gene expression(5), but it remains poorly understood how newly synthesized HSPs return to basal levels when HSF1 activity is attenuated. CHIP (carboxy terminus of Hsp70-binding protein), a dual-function co-chaperone/ubiquitin ligase, targets a broad range of chaperone substrates for proteasomal degradation(6-11). Here we show that CHIP not only enhances Hsp70 induction during acute stress but also mediates its turnover during the stress recovery process. Central to this dual-phase regulation is its substrate dependence: CHIP preferentially ubiquitinates chaperone-bound substrates, whereas degradation of Hsp70 by CHIP-dependent targeting to the ubiquitin-proteasome system occurs when misfolded substrates have been depleted. The sequential catalysis of the CHIP-associated chaperone adaptor and its bound substrate provides an elegant mechanism for maintaining homeostasis by tuning chaperone levels appropriately to reflect the status of protein folding within the cytoplasm.","Univ N Carolina, Sch Med, Carolina Cardiovasc Biol Ctr, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA; Univ N Carolina, Sch Med, Dept Cell & Dev Biol, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA","Patterson, C (reprint author), Univ N Carolina, Sch Med, Carolina Cardiovasc Biol Ctr, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA.",cpatters@med.unc.edu,,,NIGMS NIH HHS [R01 GM061728],,,26,196,209,0,14,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,23-Mar,2006,440,7083,,,,,551,555,,10.1038/nature04600,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,024DV,WOS:000236176100060,16554822,No,,,11/20/17

HSF1 activation involves trimerization and acquisition of a site-specific DNA-binding activity(2,3), which is negatively regulated by interaction with certain HSPs(4-6). Here we show that HSF1 activation by heat shock is an active process that is mediated by a ribonucleoprotein complex containing translation elongation factor eEF1A and a previously unknown non-coding RNA that we term HSR1 (heat shock RNA-1).

Eukaryotic mRNAs where translation termination occurs too soon (nonsense-mediated decay) 1 or fails to occur (non-stop decay) 2 are rapidly degraded. We show that yeast mRNAs with stalls in translation elongation are recognized and targeted for endonucleolytic cleavage, referred to as 'no-go decay'. The cleavage triggered by no-go decay is dependent on translation and involves Dom34p and Hbs1p. Dom34p and Hbs1p are similar to the translation termination factors eRF1 and eRF3 (refs 3, 4), indicating that these proteins might function in recognizing the stalled ribosome and triggering endonucleolytic cleavage. No-go decay provides a mechanism for clearing the cell of stalled translation elongation complexes, which could occur as a result of damaged mRNAs or ribosomes, or as a mechanism of post-transcriptional control.","Univ Arizona, Dept Mol & Cellular Biol, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA","Parker, R (reprint author), Univ Arizona, Dept Mol & Cellular Biol, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA.",rrparker@u.arizona.edu,,,NIGMS NIH HHS [R37 GM045443],,,28,321,329,1,20,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,23-Mar,2006,440,7083,,,,,561,564,,10.1038/nature04530,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,024DV,WOS:000236176100062,16554824,No,,,11/20/17

The molecular natures and identities of coupling proteins that allow microtubule depolymerization to pull chromosomes to poles during anaphase have long remained elusive(1). In budding yeast, the ten-protein Dam1 complex is a critical microtubule-binding component of the kinetochore(2) that oligomerizes into a 50-nm ring around a microtubule in vitro(3,4). Here we show, with the use of a real-time, two-colour fluorescence microscopy assay, that the ring complex moves processively for several micrometres at the ends of depolymerizing microtubules without detaching from the lattice. Electron microscopic analysis of 'end-on views' revealed a 16-fold symmetry of the kinetochore rings. This out-of-register arrangement with respect to the 13-fold microtubule symmetry is consistent with a sliding mechanism based on an electrostatically coupled ring-microtubule interface. The Dam1 ring complex is a molecular device that can translate the force generated by microtubule depolymerization into movement along the lattice to facilitate chromosome segregation.","Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mol & Cell Biol, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; Univ Calif Berkeley, Lawrence Berkeley Lab, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; Univ Calif Berkeley, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA","Barnes, G (reprint author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mol & Cell Biol, 229 Stanley Hall, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",gbarnes@socrates.berkeley.edu,,,,,,30,168,188,0,14,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,23-Mar,2006,440,7083,,,,,565,569,,10.1038/nature04409,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,024DV,WOS:000236176100063,16415853,No,,,11/20/17

Most tetrameric cation channels, which include the K+, Ca2+, Na+ and cyclic nucleotide-gated channels, probably share a similar overall architecture in their ion-conduction pore, but the structural details that determine ion selection are different. Although K+ channel selectivity has been well studied from a structural perspective(1,2), little is known about the structure of other cation channels. Here we present crystal structures of the NaK channel from Bacillus cereus, a non-selective tetrameric cation channel, in its Na+- and K+-bound states at 2.4 angstrom and 2.8 angstrom resolution, respectively. The NaK channel shares high sequence homology and a similar overall structure with the bacterial KcsA K+ channel, but its selectivity filter adopts a different architecture. Unlike a K+ channel selectivity filter, which contains four equivalent K+-binding sites, the selectivity filter of the NaK channel preserves the two cation-binding sites equivalent to sites 3 and 4 of a K+ channel, whereas the region corresponding to sites 1 and 2 of a K+ channel becomes a vestibule in which ions can diffuse but not bind specifically. Functional analysis using an Rb-86 flux assay shows that the NaK channel can conduct both Na+ and K+ ions. We conclude that the sequence of the NaK selectivity filter resembles that of a cyclic nucleotide-gated channel and its structure may represent that of a cyclic nucleotide-gated channel pore.","Univ Texas, SW Med Ctr, Dept Physiol, Dallas, TX 75390 USA","Jiang, YX (reprint author), Univ Texas, SW Med Ctr, Dept Physiol, Dallas, TX 75390 USA.",youxing.jiang@utsouthwestern.edu,,,NIGMS NIH HHS [R01 GM079179],,,27,154,156,1,16,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,23-Mar,2006,440,7083,,,,,570,574,,10.1038/nature04508,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,024DV,WOS:000236176100064,16467789,No,,,11/20/17

A key goal for this approach is to create nanostructures of high complexity, matching that routinely achieved by ' top- down' methods. The self- assembly of DNA molecules provides an attractive route towards this goal. Here I describe a simple method for folding long, single- stranded DNA molecules into arbitrary two- dimensional shapes. The design for a desired shape is made by raster- filling the shape with a 7- kilobase single- stranded scaffold and by choosing over 200 short oligonucleotide ' staple strands' to hold the scaffold in place. Once synthesized and mixed, the staple and scaffold strands self- assemble in a single step. The resulting DNA structures are roughly 100 nm in diameter and approximate desired shapes such as squares, disks and five- pointed stars with a spatial resolution of 6 nm. Because each oligonucleotide can serve as a 6- nm pixel, the structures can be programmed to bear complex patterns such as words and images on their surfaces. Finally, individual DNA structures can be programmed to form larger assemblies, including extended periodic lattices and a hexamer of triangles ( which constitutes a 30- megadalton molecular complex).","CALTECH, Dept Comp Sci & Computat Neural Syst, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA","Rothemund, PWK (reprint author), CALTECH, Dept Comp Sci & Computat Neural Syst, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA.",pwkr@dna.caltech.edu,,,,,,24,2586,2628,81,1006,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,16-Mar,2006,440,7082,,,,,297,302,,10.1038/nature04586,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,021QG,WOS:000235997600044,16541064,No,,,11/20/17

Over 400 of these enzymes are non- essential for Salmonella virulence, reflecting extensive metabolic redundancies and access to surprisingly diverse host nutrients. The essential enzymes identified were almost exclusively associated with a small subgroup of pathways, enabling us to perform a nearly exhaustive screen. Sixty- four enzymes identified as essential in Salmonella are conserved in other important human pathogens, but almost all belong to metabolic pathways that are inhibited by current antibiotics or that have previously been considered for antimicrobial development.

Characterization of the magnetic field at the Galactic Centre is important because it can affect the orbits of molecular clouds by exerting a drag on them, inhibit star formation, and could guide a wind of hot gas or cosmic rays away from the central region. Here we report observations of an infrared nebula having the morphology of an intertwined double helix about 100 parsecs from the Galaxy's dynamical centre, with its axis oriented perpendicular to the Galactic plane. The observed segment is about 25 parsecs in length, and contains about 1.25 full turns of each of the two continuous, helically wound strands. We interpret this feature as a torsional Alfven wave propagating vertically away from the Galactic disk, driven by rotation of the magnetized circumnuclear gas disk. The direct connection between the circumnuclear disk and the double helix is ambiguous, but the images show a possible meandering channel that warrants further investigation.","Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Phys & Astron, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; Cornell Univ, Ctr Radiophys & Space Res, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA","Morris, M (reprint author), Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Phys & Astron, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.",morris@astro.ucla.edu,,"Do, Tuan/0000-0001-9554-6062; Morris, Mark/0000-0002-6753-2066",,,,26,44,44,1,4,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,16-Mar,2006,440,7082,,,,,308,310,,10.1038/nature04554,,3,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,021QG,WOS:000235997600046,16541066,No,,,11/20/17

Even the most fundamental physical properties of brown dwarfs remain, however, largely unconstrained by direct measurement. Here we report the discovery of a brown- dwarf eclipsing binary system, in the Orion Nebula star- forming region, from which we obtain direct measurements of mass and radius for these newly formed brown dwarfs. Our mass measurements establish both objects as brown dwarfs, with masses of 0.054 +/- 0.005M. and 0.034 +/- 0.003M. At the same time, with radii relative to the Sun's of 0.669 +/- 0.034R. and 0.511 +/- 0.026R., these brown dwarfs are more akin to low- mass stars in size. Such large radii are generally consistent with theoretical predictions for young brown dwarfs in the earliest stages of gravitational contraction(4,5).

A landmark theoretical result in few- body quantum physics is Efimov's prediction(1,2) of a universal set of bound trimer states appearing for three identical bosons with a resonant two- body interaction. Counterintuitively, these states even exist in the absence of a corresponding two- body bound state. Since the formulation of Efimov's problem in the context of nuclear physics 35 years ago, it has attracted great interest in many areas of physics(3-8). However, the observation of Efimov quantum states has remained an elusive goal(3,5). Here we report the observation of an Efimov resonance in an ultracold gas of caesium atoms. The resonance occurs in the range of large negative two- body scattering lengths, arising from the coupling of three free atoms to an Efimov trimer. Experimentally, we observe its signature as a giant three- body recombination loss(9,10) when the strength of the two- body interaction is varied. We also detect a minimum(9,11,12) in the recombination loss for positive scattering lengths, indicating destructive interference of decay pathways. Our results confirm central theoretical predictions of Efimov physics and represent a starting point with which to explore the universal properties of resonantly interacting few- body systems(7). While Feshbach resonances(13,14) have provided the key to control quantum- mechanical interactions on the two- body level, Efimov resonances connect ultracold matter(15) to the world of few- body quantum phenomena.","Univ Innsbruck, Inst Expt Phys, A-6020 Innsbruck, Austria; Univ Chicago, James Franck Inst, Dept Phys, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; Austrian Acad Sci, Inst Quantenopt & Quanteninformat, A-6020 Innsbruck, Austria","Nagerl, HC (reprint author), Univ Innsbruck, Inst Expt Phys, Technikerstr 25, A-6020 Innsbruck, Austria.",christoph.naegerl@ultracold.at,"Naegerl, Hanns-Christoph/E-7329-2010; Grimm, Rudolf/D-2864-2009; Danzl, Johann/N-9987-2015","Naegerl, Hanns-Christoph/0000-0002-7789-4431; Grimm, Rudolf/0000-0003-1085-5558; Danzl, Johann/0000-0001-8559-3973",,,,30,595,603,2,41,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,16-Mar,2006,440,7082,,,,,315,318,,10.1038/nature04626,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,021QG,WOS:000235997600048,16541068,No,,,11/20/17

While dislocations have been studied extensively in conventional materials, recent results have shown that colloidal crystals offer a potential model system for visualizing their structure and dynamics directly in real space(2). Although thermal fluctuations are thought to play a critical role in the nucleation of these defects, it is difficult to observe them directly. Nano-indentation, during which a small tip deforms a crystalline film, is a common tool for introducing dislocations into a small volume that is initially defect-free(3-10). Here, we show that an analogue of nano- indentation performed on a colloidal crystal provides direct images of defect formation in real time and on the single particle level, allowing us to probe the effects of thermal fluctuations. We implement a new method to determine the strain tensor of a distorted crystal lattice and we measure the critical dislocation loop size and the rate of dislocation nucleation directly. Using continuum models, we elucidate the relation between thermal fluctuations and the applied strain that governs defect nucleation. Moreover, we estimate that although bond energies between particles are about fifty times larger in atomic systems, the difference in attempt frequencies makes the effects of thermal fluctuations remarkably similar, so that our results are also relevant for atomic crystals.","Harvard Univ, Dept Phys, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; Harvard Univ, Div Engn & Appl Sci, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA","Schall, P (reprint author), Univ Amsterdam, Van der Waals Zeeman Inst, Valckenierstr 65, NL-1018 XE Amsterdam, Netherlands.",pschall@science.uva.nl,,,,,,20,149,150,8,94,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,16-Mar,2006,440,7082,,,,,319,323,,10.1038/nature04557,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,021QG,WOS:000235997600049,16541069,No,,,11/20/17

After initial rifting, however, the displacement on normal faults observed at the sea floor seems not to match the inferred extension(2). Here we show that crustal thinning can be accomplished in such extensional environments by a system of conjugate concave downward faults instead of multiple normal faults. Our model predicts that these concave faults accumulate large amounts of extension and forma very thin crust (< 10 km) by exhumation of mid- crustal and mantle material. This transitional crust is capped by sub- horizontal detachment surfaces over distances exceeding 100 km with little visible deformation. Our rift model is based on numerical experiments constrained by geological and geophysical observations from the Alpine Tethys and Iberia/ Newfoundland margins(3-9). Furthermore, we suggest that the observed transition from broadly distributed and symmetric extension to localized and asymmetric rifting is directly controlled by the existence of a strong gabbroic lower crust. The presence of such lower crustal gabbros is well constrained for the Alpine Tethys system(4,9). Initial decoupling of upper crustal deformation from lower crustal and mantle deformation by progressive weakening of the middle crust is an essential requirement to reproduce the observed rift evolution.

In Europe these carnivorous dinosaurs are represented primarily by only two skeletons of Compsognathus(1,2), neither of which is well preserved. Here we describe a small new theropod dinosaur from the Late Jurassic period of Schamhaupten in southern Germany(3,4). Being exquisitely preserved and complete from the snout to the distal third of the tail, the new fossil is the best- preserved predatory, non- avian dinosaur in Europe. It possesses a suite of characters that support its identification as a basal coelurosaur. A cladistic analysis indicates that the new taxon is closer to maniraptorans than to tyrannosauroids, grouping it with taxa often considered to be compsognathids. Large portions of integument are preserved along its tail. The absence of feathers or feather- like structures in a fossil phylogenetically nested within feathered theropods(5,6) indicates that the evolution of these integumentary structures might be more complex than previously thought.","Nat Hist Museum Los Angeles Cty, Dinosaur Inst, Los Angeles, CA 90007 USA; Univ Munich, Dept Geo & Environm Sci, Sect Paleontol, D-80333 Munich, Germany","Chiappe, LM (reprint author), Nat Hist Museum Los Angeles Cty, Dinosaur Inst, 900 Exposit Blvd, Los Angeles, CA 90007 USA.",chiappe@nhm.org,,,,,,28,48,52,0,7,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,16-Mar,2006,440,7082,,,,,329,332,,10.1038/nature04579,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,021QG,WOS:000235997600051,16541071,No,,,11/20/17

Amphibians, reptiles and most birds generally have limited hearing capacity, with the ability to detect and produce sounds below similar to 12 kHz. Here we report evidence of ultrasonic communication in an amphibian, the concave- eared torrent frog ( Amolops tormotus) from Huangshan Hot Springs, China. Males of A. tormotus produce diverse bird- like melodic calls with pronounced frequency modulations that often contain spectral energy in the ultrasonic range(3,4). To determine whether A. tormotus communicates using ultrasound to avoid masking by the wideband background noise of local fast- flowing streams, or whether the ultrasound is simply a by- product of the sound-production mechanism, we conducted acoustic playback experiments in the frogs' natural habitat. We found that the audible as well as the ultrasonic components of an A. tormotus call can evoke male vocal responses. Electrophysiological recordings from the auditory midbrain confirmed the ultrasonic hearing capacity of these frogs and that of a sympatric species facing similar environmental constraints. This extraordinary upward extension into the ultrasonic range of both the harmonic content of the advertisement calls and the frog's hearing sensitivity is likely to have co-evolved in response to the intense, predominantly low- frequency ambient noise from local streams. Because amphibians are a distinct evolutionary lineage from microchiropterans and cetaceans ( which have evolved ultrasonic hearing to minimize congestion in the frequency bands used for sound communication(5) and to increase hunting efficacy in darkness(2)), ultrasonic perception in these animals represents a new example of independent evolution.","Univ Illinois, Dept Mol & Integrat Physiol, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; Univ Illinois, Beckman Inst, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Physiol Sci & Ecol, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Evolutionary Biol, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; Chinese Acad Sci, Shanghai Inst Biol Sci, Shanghai 200032, Peoples R China; Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Biophys, State Key Lab Brain & Cognit Sci, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China","Feng, AS (reprint author), Univ Illinois, Dept Mol & Integrat Physiol, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.",afeng1@uiuc.edu,"YU, ZULIN/D-7979-2012",,,,,26,148,166,2,70,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,16-Mar,2006,440,7082,,,,,333,336,,10.1038/nature04416,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,021QG,WOS:000235997600052,16541072,No,,,11/20/17

Approaches such as biodiversity hotspots(4), endemic bird areas(5) and ecoregions(6) are used by international organizations to prioritize conservation efforts globally(7). Although identifying priority regions is an important first step in solving this problem, it does not indicate how limited resources should be allocated between regions. Here we formulate how to allocate optimally conservation resources between regions identified as priorities for conservation - the 'conservation resource allocation problem'. Stochastic dynamic programming is used to find the optimal schedule of resource allocation for small problems but is intractable for large problems owing to the "" curse of dimensionality""(8). We identify two easy- to- use and easy- to- interpret heuristics that closely approximate the optimal solution. We also show the importance of both correctly formulating the problem and using information on how investment returns change through time. Our conservation resource allocation approach can be applied at any spatial scale. We demonstrate the approach with an example of optimal resource allocation among five priority regions in Wallacea and Sundaland, the transition zone between Asia and Australasia.","Univ Queensland, Ctr Ecol, Sch Integrat Biol, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia; Univ Queensland, Ctr Ecol, Sch Phys Sci, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia","Wilson, KA (reprint author), Univ Queensland, Ctr Ecol, Sch Integrat Biol, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia.",k.wilson2@uq.edu.au,"Bode, Michael/A-7116-2009; Possingham, Hugh/B-1337-2008; McBride, Marissa/D-5573-2009; Wilson, Kerrie/C-8058-2009","Bode, Michael/0000-0002-5886-4421; Possingham, Hugh/0000-0001-7755-996X; Wilson, Kerrie/0000-0002-0092-935X; McBride, Marissa/0000-0002-7498-292X",,,,28,306,323,11,168,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,16-Mar,2006,440,7082,,,,,337,340,,10.1038/nature04366,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,021QG,WOS:000235997600053,16541073,No,,,11/20/17

Here we trace the subsequent losses of duplicated genes, and show that the pattern of loss differs among the three species at 20% of all loci. For example, several transcription factor genes, including STE12, TEC1, TUP1 and MCM1, are single-copy in S. cerevisiae but are retained in duplicate in S. castellii and C. glabrata. At many loci, different species have lost different members of a duplicated gene pair, so that 4 - 7% of single- copy genes compared between any two species are not orthologues. This pattern of gene loss provides strong evidence for speciation through a version of the Bateson - Dobzhansky - Muller mechanism, in which the loss of alternative copies of duplicated genes leads to reproductive isolation(1,2). We show that the lineages leading to the three species diverged shortly after the whole-genome duplication, during a period of precipitous gene loss. The set of loci at which single- copy paralogues are retained is biased towards genes involved in ribosome biogenesis and genes that evolve slowly, consistent with the hypothesis that reciprocal gene loss is more likely to occur between duplicated genes that are functionally indistinguishable. We propose a simple, unified model in which a single mechanism - passive gene loss - enabled whole- genome duplication and led to the rapid emergence of new yeast species.","Univ Dublin Trinity Coll, Smurfit Inst Genet, Dublin 2, Ireland","Wolfe, KH (reprint author), Univ Dublin Trinity Coll, Smurfit Inst Genet, Dublin 2, Ireland.",khwolfe@tcd.ie,"Wolfe, Kenneth/B-4653-2009","Scannell, Devin/0000-0002-8188-5992; Wolfe, Kenneth/0000-0003-4992-4979; Gordon, Jonathan/0000-0002-1033-4368",,,,25,250,265,2,36,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,16-Mar,2006,440,7082,,,,,341,345,,10.1038/nature04562,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,021QG,WOS:000235997600054,16541074,No,,,11/20/17

Young Tg2576 mice (< 6 months old) have normal memory and lack neuropathology, middle- aged mice ( 6 - 14 months old) develop memory deficits without neuronal loss, and old mice (> 14 months old) form abundant neuritic plaques containing amyloid-beta ( refs 3 - 6). We found that memory deficits in middle- aged Tg2576 mice are caused by the extracellular accumulation of a 56- kDa soluble amyloid-beta assembly, which we term A beta* 56 ( A beta star 56). A beta* 56 purified from the brains of impaired Tg2576 mice disrupts memory when administered to young rats.

These stochastic events of protein production are difficult to observe directly with measurements on large ensembles of cells owing to lack of synchronization among cells. Measurements so far on single cells lack the sensitivity to resolve individual events of protein production. Here we demonstrate a microfluidic- based assay that allows real- time observation of the expression of beta-galactosidase in living Escherichia coli cells with single molecule sensitivity. We observe that protein production occurs in bursts, with the number of molecules per burst following an exponential distribution. We show that the two key parameters of protein expression - the burst size and frequency - can be either determined directly from real- time monitoring of protein production or extracted from a measurement of the steady- state copy number distribution in a population of cells. Application of this assay to probe gene expression in individual budding yeast and mouse embryonic stem cells demonstrates its generality. Many important proteins are expressed at low levels(7,8), and are thus inaccessible by current genomic and proteomic techniques.

The sensing of peroxides is typically mediated by redox- active cysteines in sensors such as the bacterial OxyR, OhrR, and Hsp33 proteins(2,3). Bacillus subtilis PerR is the prototype for a widespread family of metal- dependent peroxide sensors that regulate inducible peroxide- defence genes(4). Here we show that PerR senses peroxides by metal- catalysed oxidation. PerR contains two metal- binding sites: a structural Zn2+ site and a regulatory divalent metal ion site that preferentially binds Fe2+ or Mn2+ ( ref. 5). Protein oxidation, catalysed by a bound ferrous ion, leads to the rapid and direct incorporation of one oxygen atom into histidine 37 ( H37) or H91, two of the residues that coordinate the bound Fe2+. This mechanism accounts for the ability of PerR to sense low levels of hydrogen peroxide in vivo. The reduction of hydrogen peroxide by metal ions to generate highly reactive hydroxyl radicals underlies the genotoxic effects of peroxides(1), and has been shown to contribute to enzyme inactivation, but has not previously been shown to provide a regulatory mechanism for peroxide sensing.","Cornell Univ, Dept Microbiol, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA","Helmann, JD (reprint author), Cornell Univ, Dept Microbiol, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",jdh9@cornell.edu,"LEE, JIN-WON/L-1116-2016","LEE, JIN-WON/0000-0002-1201-8254; Helmann, John/0000-0002-3832-3249",,,,27,288,295,3,43,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,16-Mar,2006,440,7082,,,,,363,367,,10.1038/nature04537,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,021QG,WOS:000235997600058,16541078,No,,,11/20/17

These enzymes couple the decarboxylation of alpha KG with the formation of a high- energy ferryl- oxo intermediate that acts as a hydrogen- abstracting species(2-4). All previously structurally characterized mononuclear iron enzymes contain a 2- His, 1- carboxylate motif that coordinates the iron(1,2). The two histidines and one carboxylate, known as the ' facial triad', form one triangular side of an octahedral iron coordination geometry. A subclass of mononuclear iron enzymes has been shown to catalyse halogenation reactions, rather than the more typical hydroxylation reaction(5,6). SyrB2, a member of this subclass, is a non- haem Fe( II)/ alpha KG-dependent halogenase that catalyses the chlorination of threonine in syringomycin E biosynthesis(5).

The bioluminescence reaction, which uses luciferin, Mg- ATP and molecular oxygen to yield an electronically excited oxyluciferin species, is carried out by the enzyme luciferase. Visible light is emitted during relaxation of excited oxyluciferin to its ground state. The high quantum yield(1) of the luciferin/ luciferase reaction and the change in bioluminescence colour caused by subtle structural differences in luciferase have attracted much research interest. In fact, a single amino acid substitution in luciferase changes the emission colour from yellow- green to red(2-5). Although the crystal structure of luciferase from the North American firefly ( Photinus pyralis) has been described(6,7), the detailed mechanism for the bioluminescence colour change is still unclear(8-11).

Comparing these structures to those of the wild- type luciferase complexed with AMP plus oxyluciferin ( products) reveals a significant conformational change in the wild- type enzyme but not in the red mutant. This conformational change involves movement of the hydrophobic side chain of Ile 288 towards the benzothiazole ring of DLSA.

Similar to the human cone photoreceptors, these ommatidial subtypes are distributed stochastically in the retina. The choice between pale versus yellow ommatidia is made in R7 cells, which then impose their fate onto R8. Here we report that the Drosophila dioxin receptor Spineless is both necessary and sufficient for the formation of the ommatidial mosaic. A short burst of spineless expression at mid-pupation in a large subset of R7 cells precedes rhodopsin expression. In spineless mutants, all R7 and most R8 cells adopt the pale fate, whereas overexpression of spineless is sufficient to induce the yellow R7 fate. Therefore, this study suggests that the entire retinal mosaic required for colour vision is defined by the stochastic expression of a single transcription factor, Spineless.","NYU, Dept Biol, Ctr Dev Genet, New York, NY 10003 USA; Washington Univ, Dept Biol, St Louis, MO 63130 USA","Desplan, C (reprint author), NYU, Dept Biol, Ctr Dev Genet, 100 Washington Pl, New York, NY 10003 USA.",claude.desplan@nyu.edu,,"mazzoni, esteban/0000-0001-8994-681X","NEI NIH HHS [R01 EY013010-10, R01 EY013010]",,,42,170,171,1,13,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,9-Mar,2006,440,7081,,,,,174,180,,10.1038/nature04615,,7,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,019MC,WOS:000235839500037,16525464,No,,,11/20/17

Various strongly interacting atomic systems are successfully treated as a collection of quasiparticles with weak or no interactions. However, there are interesting limitations to this description: in some systems the very existence of quasiparticles cannot be taken for granted. Like unstable elementary particles, quasiparticles cannot survive beyond a threshold where certain decay channels become allowed by conservation laws; their spectrum terminates at this threshold. Such quasiparticle breakdown was first predicted for an exotic state of matter-super-fluid He-4 at temperatures close to absolute zero, a quantum Bose liquid where zero-point atomic motion precludes crystallization(1-4). Here we show, using neutron scattering, that quasiparticle breakdown can also occur in a quantum magnet and, by implication, in other systems with Bose quasiparticles. We have measured spin excitations in a two-dimensional quantum magnet, piperazinium hexachlorodicuprate (PHCC)(5), in which spin-1/2 copper ions form a non-magnetic quantum spin liquid, and find remarkable similarities with excitations in superfluid He-4. We observe a threshold momentum beyond which the quasiparticle peak merges with the two-quasiparticle continuum. It then acquires a finite energy width and becomes indistinguishable from a leading-edge singularity, so that excited states are no longer quasiparticles but occupy a wide band of energy. Our findings have important ramifications for understanding excitations with gapped spectra in many condensed matter systems, ranging from band insulators to high-transition-temperature superconductors(6).","Brookhaven Natl Lab, Dept Mat Sci, Upton, NY 11973 USA; Oak Ridge Natl Lab, Condensed Matter Sci Div, Oak Ridge, TN 37831 USA; Johns Hopkins Univ, Dept Phys & Astron, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA; Natl Inst Stand & Technol, Gaithersburg, MD 20899 USA","Zaliznyak, IA (reprint author), Brookhaven Natl Lab, Dept Mat Sci, Upton, NY 11973 USA.",zaliznyak@bnl.gov,"Hong, Tao/F-8166-2010; Broholm, Collin/E-8228-2011; Stone, Matthew/G-3275-2011; Zaliznyak, Igor/E-8532-2014","Hong, Tao/0000-0002-0161-8588; Broholm, Collin/0000-0002-1569-9892; Stone, Matthew/0000-0001-7884-9715; Zaliznyak, Igor/0000-0002-9886-3255",,,,27,52,52,1,22,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,9-Mar,2006,440,7081,,,,,187,190,,10.1038/nature04593,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,019MC,WOS:000235839500040,16525467,No,,,11/20/17

Their strength is evident in the hardness of diamonds(1,2) and tensile strength of polymeric fibres(3-6); on the single-molecule level, it manifests itself in the need for forces of several nanonewtons to extend and mechanically rupture one bond. Such forces have been generated using extensional flow(7-9), ultrasonic irradiation(10), receding meniscus(11) and by directly stretching a single molecule with nanoprobes(12-16). Here we show that simple adsorption of brush-like macromolecules with long side chains on a substrate can induce not only conformational deformations(17), but also spontaneous rupture of covalent bonds in the macromolecular backbone. We attribute this behaviour to the fact that the attractive interaction between the side chains and the substrate is maximized by the spreading of the side chains, which in turn induces tension along the polymer backbone. Provided the side-chain densities and substrate interaction are sufficiently high, the tension generated will be strong enough to rupture covalent carbon-carbon bonds. We expect similar adsorption-induced backbone scission to occur for all macromolecules with highly branched architectures, such as brushes and dendrimers. This behaviour needs to be considered when designing surface-targeted macromolecules of this type either to avoid undesired degradation, or to ensure rupture at predetermined macromolecular sites.","Univ N Carolina, Dept Chem, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA; Carnegie Mellon Univ, Dept Chem, Ctr Macromol Engn, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA","Sheiko, SS (reprint author), Univ N Carolina, Dept Chem, CB 3290, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA.",sergei@email.unc.edu,"ATRP, ATRP/A-3613-2009; Matyjaszewski, Krzysztof/A-2508-2008; Sheiko, Sergei/H-5430-2017","Matyjaszewski, Krzysztof/0000-0003-1960-3402; ",,,,24,240,245,3,113,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,9-Mar,2006,440,7081,,,,,191,194,,10.1038/nature04576,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,019MC,WOS:000235839500041,16525468,No,,,11/20/17

The sources of nitrous acid in the troposphere, however, are still poorly understood. Recent atmospheric measurements(7,10-17) revealed a strongly enhanced formation of nitrous acid during daytime via unknown mechanisms. Here we expose humic acid films to nitrogen dioxide in an irradiated tubular gas flow reactor and find that reduction of nitrogen dioxide on light-activated humic acids is an important source of gaseous nitrous acid. Our findings indicate that soil and other surfaces containing humic acid exhibit an organic surface photochemistry that produces reductive surface species, which react selectively with nitrogen dioxide. The observed rate of nitrous acid formation could explain the recently observed high daytime concentrations of nitrous acid in the boundary layer, the photolysis of which accounts for up to 60 per cent of the integrated hydroxyl radical source strengths(3,6-13).

This bimodality reveals the presence of ancient compositional striations (streaks) in the Indian Ocean upper mantle.

We recently showed that unusual microbial populations, including a new division of Archaea (MSBL1)(3), inhabit the NaCl-rich hypersaline brine. High salinities tend to reduce biodiversity(4), but when brines come into contact with fresher water the natural haloclines formed frequently contain gradients of other chemicals, including permutations of electron donors and acceptors, that may enhance microbial diversity, activity and biogeochemical cycling(5,6). Here we report a 2.5-m-thick chemocline with a steep NaCl gradient at 3.3 km within the water column between Bannock anoxic hypersaline brine(7) and overlying sea water. The chemocline supports some of the most biomass-rich and active microbial communities in the deep sea, dominated by Bacteria rather than Archaea, and including four major new divisions of Bacteria. Significantly higher metabolic activities were measured in the chemocline than in the overlying sea water and underlying brine; functional analyses indicate that a range of biological processes is likely to occur in the chemocline. Many prokaryotic taxa, including the phylogenetically new groups, were confined to defined salinities, and collectively formed a diverse, sharply stratified, deep-sea ecosystem with sufficient biomass to potentially contribute to organic geological deposits.","Univ Milan, DiSTAM, CoNISMa, I-20133 Milan, Italy; Univ Groningen, CEES, Dept Microbial Ecol, NL-9751 NN Haren, Netherlands; CNR, Ist Ambiente Marino Costiero, I-98122 Messina, Italy; Univ Mediterranee, CNRS, UMR 6117, LMGEM, F-13288 Marseille, France; Univ Essex, Dept Biol Sci, Colchester CO4 3SQ, Essex, England; GBF, Div Microbiol, D-38122 Braunschweig, Germany; Inst Marine Biol Crete, Iraklion 71003, Greece; Univ Utrecht, Fac Geosci, NL-3584 CD Utrecht, Netherlands; Southampton Oceanog Ctr, Southampton SO14 3EE, Hants, England; Univ Patras, Dept Geol, Patras 26100, Greece; Tecnomare SpA, ENI Grp, I-30124 Venice, Italy; Univ Appl Sci, Tech Fachhsch Berlin, D-13353 Berlin, Germany; Univ Milano Bicocca, DGSG, CoNISMa, I-20126 Milan, Italy","Daffonchio, D (reprint author), Univ Milan, DiSTAM, CoNISMa, I-20133 Milan, Italy.",daniele.daffonchio@unimi.it,"D'Auria, Giuseppe/E-6583-2010; McGenity, Terry/B-8661-2011; Bolhuis, Henk/A-4308-2008; Corselli, Cesare/E-9970-2011; Hallsworth, John/K-7876-2013; De Lange, Gert/B-9639-2014; Bolhuis, Henk/H-8535-2014","Hallsworth, John/0000-0001-6797-9362; De Lange, Gert/0000-0002-9420-3022; Bolhuis, Henk/0000-0002-4772-1898; Sass, Andrea/0000-0001-9396-7648; Daffonchio, Daniele/0000-0003-0947-925X; Malinverno, Elisa/0000-0002-9124-5155; Yakimov, Michail/0000-0003-1418-363X; Hubner, Andreas/0000-0001-7342-9789; McGenity, Terence/0000-0002-1497-8822; McKew, Boyd/0000-0001-5607-6619; Golyshin, Peter/0000-0002-5433-0350",,,,29,98,105,0,34,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,9-Mar,2006,440,7081,,,,,203,207,,10.1038/nature04418,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,019MC,WOS:000235839500044,16525471,No,,,11/20/17

Mimetic advantage is considered to be dependent on frequency because an increase in mimic abundance leads to breakdown of the warning signal(2,3). Where multiple toxic species are available, batesian polymorphism(4) is predicted-that is, mimics diversify to match sympatric models. Despite the prevalence of batesian mimicry in nature(5), batesian polymorphism is relatively rare(6). Here we explore a poison-frog mimicry complex comprising two parapatric models and a geographically dimorphic mimic that shows monomorphism where models co-occur. Contrary to classical predictions, our toxicity assays, field observations and spectral reflectances show that mimics resemble the less-toxic and less-abundant model. We examine ""stimulus generalization""(7) as a mechanism for this non-intuitive result with learning experiments using naive avian predators and live poison frogs. We find that predators differ in avoidance generalization depending on toxicity of the model, conferring greater protection to mimics resembling the less-toxic model owing to overlap of generalized avoidance curves. Our work supports a mechanism of toxicity-dependent stimulus generalization(8), revealing an additional solution for batesian mimicry where multiple models coexist.","Univ Texas, Sect Integrat Biol, Austin, TX 78712 USA","Darst, CR (reprint author), Univ Texas, Sect Integrat Biol, 1 Univ Stn, Austin, TX 78712 USA.",catdarst@mail.utexas.edu,,,,,,27,90,94,5,109,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,9-Mar,2006,440,7081,,,,,208,211,,10.1038/nature04297,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,019MC,WOS:000235839500045,16525472,No,,,11/20/17

Here we show that global patterns of richness are highly correlated among amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals, as are endemism patterns. Furthermore, we demonstrate that although the correlation between global richness and endemism is low, aggregate regions selected for high levels of endemism capture significantly more species than expected by chance. Although areas high in endemism have long been targeted for the protection of narrow-ranging species(11,12), our findings provide evidence that endemism is also a useful surrogate for the conservation of all terrestrial vertebrates.","Univ Virginia, Dept Environm Sci, Charlottesville, VA 22904 USA; World Wildlife Fund US, Washington, DC 20037 USA; Wildlife Conservat Soc S Pacific, Suva, Fiji; Univ N Carolina, Curriculum Ecol, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA","Lamoreux, JF (reprint author), Univ Virginia, Dept Environm Sci, 291 McCormick Rd, Charlottesville, VA 22904 USA.",lamoreux@virginia.edu,"Shugart, Herman/C-5156-2009","Shugart, Herman/0000-0002-1766-8379",,,,30,248,268,9,115,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,9-Mar,2006,440,7081,,,,,212,214,,10.1038/nature04291,,3,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,019MC,WOS:000235839500046,16382239,No,,,11/20/17

In spite of efforts to address the organization of the locomotor CPG in walking animals(2,4-6), little is known about the identity and function of the spinal interneuron cell types that contribute to these locomotor networks. Here we use four complementary genetic approaches to directly address the function of mouse V1 neurons, a class of local circuit inhibitory interneurons that selectively express the transcription factor Engrailed1. Our results show that V1 neurons shape motor outputs during locomotion and are required for generating 'fast' motor bursting.

Severe osteopetrosis is also observed with mutations in the OSTM1 gene, which encodes a membrane protein of unknown function(5). Here we show that both ClC-7 and Ostm1 proteins co-localize in late endosomes and lysosomes of various tissues, as well as in the ruffled border of bone-resorbing osteoclasts. Co-immunoprecipitations show that ClC-7 and Ostm1 form a molecular complex and suggest that Ostm1 is a beta-subunit of ClC-7. ClC-7 is required for Ostm1 to reach lysosomes, where the highly glycosylated Ostm1 luminal domain is cleaved. Protein but not RNA levels of ClC-7 are greatly reduced in grey-lethal mice, which lack Ostm1, suggesting that the ClC-7-Ostm1 interaction is important for protein stability. As ClC-7 protein levels in Ostm1-deficient tissues and cells, including osteoclasts, are decreased below 10% of normal levels, Ostm1 mutations probably cause osteopetrosis by impairing the acidification of the osteoclast resorption lacuna, which depends on ClC-7 (ref. 3). The finding that grey-lethal mice, just like ClC-7-deficient mice(4), show lysosomal storage and neurodegeneration in addition to osteopetrosis implies a more general importance for ClC-7-Ostm1 complexes.","Univ Hamburg, ZMNH, Zentrum Mol Neurobiol Hamburg, D-20246 Hamburg, Germany","Jentsch, TJ (reprint author), Univ Hamburg, ZMNH, Zentrum Mol Neurobiol Hamburg, Falkenried 94, D-20246 Hamburg, Germany.",Jentsch@zmnh.uni-hamburg.de,"Lange, Philipp/E-5752-2011","Lange, Philipp/0000-0003-1171-5864; Fuhrmann, Jens/0000-0001-5730-381X; Jentsch, Thomas/0000-0002-3509-2553",,,,26,178,185,1,7,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,9-Mar,2006,440,7081,,,,,220,223,,10.1038/nature04535,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,019MC,WOS:000235839500048,16525474,No,,,11/20/17

How such unity and diversity are reflected in molecular repertoires is unclear. The flagellated protozoan parasite Trypanosoma brucei is endemic in sub-Saharan Africa, causing devastating disease in humans and other animals(2). There is little hope of a vaccine for African sleeping sickness and a desperate need for modern drug therapies(3). Here we present a detailed proteomic analysis of the trypanosome flagellum. RNA interference (RNAi)-based interrogation of this proteome provides functional insights into human ciliary diseases and establishes that flagellar function is essential to the bloodstream-form trypanosome. We show that RNAi-mediated ablation of various proteins identified in the trypanosome flagellar proteome leads to a rapid and marked failure of cytokinesis in bloodstream-form ( but not procyclic insect-form) trypanosomes, suggesting that impairment of flagellar function may provide a method of disease control.

The adaptor protein ASC is essential for inflammasome function(1,2), binding directly to caspase-1 (refs 3, 4), but the triggers of this interaction are less clear. ASC also interacts with the adaptor cryopyrin (also known as NALP3 or CIAS1)(5,6). Activating mutations in cryopyrin are associated with familial cold autoinflammatory syndrome, Muckle-Wells syndrome and neonatal onset multisystem inflammatory disease, diseases that are characterized by excessive production of IL-1 beta(5,7). Here we show that cryopyrin-deficient macrophages cannot activate caspase-1 in response to Toll-like receptor agonists plus ATP, the latter activating the P2X(7) receptor to decrease intracellular K+ levels(8,9). The release of IL-1 beta in response to nigericin, a potassium ionophore, and maitotoxin, a potent marine toxin, was also found to be dependent on cryopyrin. In contrast to Asc(-/-) macrophages, cells deficient in the gene encoding cryopyrin (Cias1(-/-)) activated caspase-1 and secreted normal levels of IL-1 beta and IL-18 when infected with Gram-negative Salmonella typhimurium or Francisella tularensis. Macrophages exposed to Gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus or Listeria monocytogenes, however, required both ASC and cryopyrin to activate caspase-1 and secrete IL-1 beta.

Cryopyrin forms a multi-protein complex termed 'the inflammasome', which contains the apoptosis-associated speck-like protein (ASC) and caspase-1, and promotes caspase-1 activation and processing of pro-interleukin (IL)-1 beta (ref. 4). Here we show the effect of cryopyrin deficiency on inflammasome function and immune responses. Cryopyrin and ASC are essential for caspase-1 activation and IL-1 beta and IL-18 production in response to bacterial RNA and the imidazoquinoline compounds R837 and R848. In contrast, secretion of tumour-necrosis factor-alpha and IL-6, as well as activation of NF-kappa B and mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) were unaffected by cryopyrin deficiency. Furthermore, we show that Toll-like receptors and cryopyrin control the secretion of IL-1 beta and IL-18 through different intracellular pathways.

Using estimates from a linear mixed model, we identify a set of genes for which expression levels have remained constant across the entire phylogeny (similar to 70 million years), and are therefore likely to be under stabilizing selection. Among the top candidates are five genes with expression levels that have previously been shown to be altered in liver carcinoma.

Ankyrin repeats contain antiparallel alpha-helices that can stack to form a superhelical spiral(2). Visual inspection of the extrapolated structure of 24 ankyrin-R repeats(2) indicates the possibility of spring-like behaviour of the putative superhelix. Moreover, stacks of 17-29 ankyrin repeats in the cytoplasmic domains of transient receptor potential (TRP) channels have been identified as candidates for a spring that gates mechanoreceptors in hair cells as well as in Drosophila bristles(3-5). Here we report that tandem ankyrin repeats exhibit tertiary-structure-based elasticity and behave as a linear and fully reversible spring in single-molecule measurements by atomic force microscopy. We also observe an unexpected ability of unfolded repeats to generate force during refolding, and report the first direct measurement of the refolding force of a protein domain.

Here we report estimates of the ground displacement associated with this event, using near-field Global Positioning System ( GPS) surveys in northwestern Sumatra combined with in situ and remote observations of the vertical motion of coral reefs. These data show that the earthquake was generated by rupture of the Sunda subduction megathrust over a distance of >1,500 kilometres and a width of,150 kilometres. Megathrust slip exceeded 20 metres offshore northern Sumatra, mostly at depths shallower than 30 kilometres. Comparison of the geodetically and seismically inferred slip distribution indicates that,30 per cent additional fault slip accrued in the 1.5 months following the 500-second-long seismic rupture. Both seismic and aseismic slip before our re-occupation of GPS sites occurred on the shallow portion of the megathrust, where the large Aceh tsunami originated.

But hitherto there have been no direct observations of both the magnetic field direction and strength in any collimated jet. Here we report measurements of the polarization of water vapour masers that trace the precessing jet emanating from the asymptotic giant branch star W43A ( at a distance of 2.6 kpc from the Sun), which is undergoing rapid evolution into a planetary nebula(2,12).

Photochemistry in the stratosphere would remove the present-day atmospheric methane in a few tens of millions of years(1). Before the Cassini-Huygens mission arrived at Saturn, widespread liquid methane or mixed hydrocarbon seas hundreds of metres in thickness were proposed as reservoirs from which methane could be resupplied to the atmosphere over geologic time(2). Titan fly-by observations(3-5) and ground-based observations(6) rule out the presence of extensive bodies of liquid hydrocarbons at present, which means that methane must be derived from another source over Titan's history. Here we show that episodic outgassing of methane stored as clathrate hydrates within an icy shell above an ammonia-enriched water ocean is the most likely explanation for Titan's atmospheric methane. The other possible explanations all fail because they cannot explain the absence of surface liquid reservoirs and/or the low dissipative state of the interior.

Unconventional superconductivity, on the other hand, develops near a phase boundary separating magnetically ordered and magnetically disordered phases(2,3). A maximum in the superconducting transition temperature T-c develops where this boundary extrapolates to zero Kelvin, suggesting that fluctuations associated with this magnetic quantum-critical point are essential for unconventional superconductivity(4,5). Invariably, though, unconventional superconductivity masks the magnetic phase boundary when T < T-c, preventing proof of a magnetic quantum-critical point(5). Here we report specific-heat measurements of the pressure-tuned unconventional superconductor CeRhIn5 in which we find a line of quantum-phase transitions induced inside the superconducting state by an applied magnetic field. This quantum-critical line separates a phase of coexisting antiferromagnetism and superconductivity from a purely unconventional superconducting phase, and terminates at a quantum tetracritical point where the magnetic field completely suppresses superconductivity. The T --> 0 K magnetic field - pressure phase diagram of CeRhIn5 is well described with a theoretical model(6,7) developed to explain field-induced magnetism in the high-T-c copper oxides, but in which a clear delineation of quantum - phase boundaries has not been possible.

The ability to engineer nanowire properties makes them especially promising in nanoelectronics(6-9). Most silicon nanowires are grown using the vapour liquid - solid (VLS) mechanism, in which the nanowire grows from a gold/silicon catalyst droplet during silicon chemical vapour deposition(10-13). Despite over 40 years of study, many aspects of VLS growth are not well understood. For example, in the conventional picture the catalyst droplet does not change during growth, and the nanowire sidewalls consist of clean silicon facets(10-13). Here we demonstrate that these assumptions are false for silicon nanowires grown on Si( 111) under conditions where all of the experimental parameters ( surface structure, gas cleanliness, and background contaminants) are carefully controlled. We show that gold diffusion during growth determines the length, shape, and sidewall properties of the nanowires. Gold from the catalyst droplets wets the nanowire sidewalls, eventually consuming the droplets and terminating VLS growth. Gold diffusion from the smaller droplets to the larger ones (Ostwald ripening) leads to nanowire diameters that change during growth. These results show that the silicon nanowire growth is fundamentally limited by gold diffusion: smooth, arbitrarily long nanowires cannot be grown without eliminating gold migration.","IBM Corp, Div Res, TJ Watson Res Ctr, Yorktown Hts, NY 10598 USA","Hannon, JB (reprint author), IBM Corp, Div Res, TJ Watson Res Ctr, Yorktown Hts, NY 10598 USA.",jbhannon@us.ibm.com,,,,,,20,650,652,25,313,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,2-Mar,2006,440,7080,,,,,69,71,,10.1038/nature04574,,3,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,017HW,WOS:000235685700040,16452928,No,,,11/20/17

The neutral theory, which assumes that individuals are demographically identical regardless of species, seeks to explain ubiquitous features of community structure and biodiversity patterns(3-5). Here we present a test of neutral-theory predictions with the use of an extensive species-level data set of Indo-Pacific coral communities. We show that coral assemblages differ markedly from neutral-model predictions for patterns of community similarity and the relative abundance of species. Within local communities, neutral models do not fit relative abundance distributions as well as the classical log-normal distribution. Relative abundances of species across local communities also differ markedly from neutral-theory predictions: coral communities exhibit community similarity values that are far more variable, and lower on average, than the neutral theory can produce. Empirical community similarities deviate from the neutral model in a direction opposite to that predicted in previous critiques of the neutral theory(6-9).

The presence of fine-scale spatio-temporal data for the 2001 epidemic has allowed the development of epidemiological models that are more accurate than those generally created for other epidemics(1-5) and provide the opportunity to explore a variety of alternative control measures. Vaccination was not used during the 2001 epidemic; however, the recent DEFRA ( Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs) contingency plan(6) details how reactive vaccination would be considered in future. Here, using the data from the 2001 epidemic, we consider the optimal deployment of limited vaccination capacity in a complex heterogeneous environment. We use a model of FMD spread to investigate the optimal deployment of reactive ring vaccination of cattle constrained by logistical resources. The predicted optimal ring size is highly dependent upon logistical constraints but is more robust to epidemiological parameters. Other ways of targeting reactive vaccination can significantly reduce the epidemic size; in particular, ignoring the order in which infections are reported and vaccinating those farms closest to any previously reported case can substantially reduce the epidemic. This strategy has the advantage that it rapidly targets new foci of infection and that determining an optimal ring size is unnecessary.","Univ Warwick, Dept Biol Sci, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England; Univ Warwick, Math Inst, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England; Univ Cambridge, Ctr Math Sci, Stat Lab, Cambridge CB3 0WB, England; Univ Edinburgh, Ashworth Labs, Ctr Infect Dis, Epidemiol Grp, Edinburgh EH9 3JF, Midlothian, Scotland; Univ Edinburgh, Royal Dick Sch Vet Studies, Easter Bush Vet Ctr, Roslin EH25 9RG, Midlothian, Scotland; Univ Cambridge, Ctr Vet Sci, Cambridge Infect Dis Consortium, Cambridge CB3 0ES, England; Penn State Univ, Mueller Lab, Biol Dept 208, Ctr Infect Dis Dynam, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; NIH, Fogarty Int Ctr, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA","Keeling, MJ (reprint author), Univ Warwick, Dept Biol Sci, Gibbet Hill Rd, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England.",m.j.keeling@warwick.ac.uk,"Tildesley, Michael/B-6559-2008; Keeling, Matt/J-9280-2012","Keeling, Matt/0000-0003-4639-4765",Wellcome Trust,,,16,130,132,4,36,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,2-Mar,2006,440,7080,,,,,83,86,,10.1038/nature04324,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,017HW,WOS:000235685700044,16511494,No,,,11/20/17

This explanation requires negative epistasis, a type of genetic interaction where mutations are more harmful in combination than expected from their separate effects. The conceptual appeal of the mutational deterministic hypothesis has been offset by our inability to identify the mechanistic and evolutionary bases of negative epistasis. Here we show that negative epistasis can evolve as a consequence of sexual reproduction itself. Using an artificial gene network model(2,3), we find that recombination between gene networks imposes selection for genetic robustness, and that negative epistasis evolves as a by-product of this selection. Our results suggest that sexual reproduction selects for conditions that favour its own maintenance, a case of evolution forging its own path.","Univ Houston, Dept Biol & Biochem, Houston, TX 77204 USA; Univ N Carolina, Dept Biomed Engn, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA; Univ N Carolina, Dept Biol, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA","Azevedo, RBR (reprint author), Univ Houston, Dept Biol & Biochem, Houston, TX 77204 USA.",razevedo@uh.edu,,"Burch, Christina/0000-0001-7830-0124; Azevedo, Ricardo/0000-0001-5402-7071",,,,30,143,146,1,26,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,2-Mar,2006,440,7080,,,,,87,90,,10.1038/nature04488,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,017HW,WOS:000235685700045,16511495,No,,,11/20/17

There is growing debate on whether VSTM capacity is limited to a fixed number of objects(2,3) or whether it is variable(4,5). Here we report four experiments using functional magnetic resonance imaging that resolve this controversy by dissociating the representation capacities of the parietal and occipital cortices. Whereas representations in the inferior intraparietal sulcus (IPS) are fixed to about four objects at different spatial locations regardless of object complexity, those in the superior IPS and the lateral occipital complex are variable, tracking the number of objects held in VSTM, and representing fewer than four objects as their complexity increases. These neural response patterns were observed during both VSTM encoding and maintenance. Thus, multiple systems act together to support VSTM: whereas the inferior IPS maintains spatial attention over a fixed number of objects at different spatial locations, the superior IPS and the lateral occipital complex encode and maintain a variable subset of the attended objects, depending on their complexity. VSTM capacity is therefore determined both by a fixed number of objects and by object complexity.","Yale Univ, Dept Psychol, New Haven, CT 06520 USA","Xu, YD (reprint author), Yale Univ, Dept Psychol, New Haven, CT 06520 USA.",yaoda.xu@yale.edu,,"Chun, Marvin/0000-0003-1070-7993",,,,30,539,552,2,44,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,2-Mar,2006,440,7080,,,,,91,95,,10.1038/nature04262,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,017HW,WOS:000235685700046,16382240,No,,,11/20/17

Defective iron homeostasis results in either iron deficiency or iron overload(1). Precise regulation of iron transport in mitochondria is essential for haem biosynthesis(2), haemoglobin production and Fe - S cluster protein assembly(3,4) during red cell development. Here we describe a zebrafish mutant, frascati (frs)(5), that shows profound hypochromic anaemia and erythroid maturation arrest owing to defects in mitochondrial iron uptake. Through positional cloning, we show that the gene mutated in the frs mutant is a member of the vertebrate mitochondrial solute carrier family (SLC25)(6) that we call mitoferrin (mfrn). mfrn is highly expressed in fetal and adult haematopoietic tissues of zebrafish and mouse. Erythroblasts generated from murine embryonic stem cells null for Mfrn ( also known as Slc25a37) show maturation arrest with severely impaired incorporation of Fe-55 into haem. Disruption of the yeast mfrn orthologues, MRS3 and MRS4, causes defects in iron metabolism and mitochondrial Fe - S cluster biogenesis(7-10). Murine Mfrn rescues the defects in frs zebrafish, and zebrafish mfrn complements the yeast mutant, indicating that the function of the gene may be highly conserved. Our data show that mfrn functions as the principal mitochondrial iron importer essential for haem biosynthesis in vertebrate erythroblasts.","Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Brigham & Womens Hosp, Dept Med,Div Hematol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; Univ Utah, Sch Med, Dept Pathol, Salt Lake City, UT 84132 USA; Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Childrens Hosp Boston, Howard Hughes Med Inst,Stem Cell Program, Boston, MA 02115 USA; Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Childrens Hosp Boston, Div Hematol Oncol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; Jackson Lab, Bar Harbor, ME 04609 USA; Univ Malta, Dept Physiol & Biochem, Msida MSD 06, Malta; Univ Penn, Childrens Hosp Philadelphia, Dept Pediat, Div Hematol, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA","Paw, BH (reprint author), Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Brigham & Womens Hosp, Dept Med,Div Hematol, Boston, MA 02115 USA.",bpaw@rics.bwh.harvard.edu,"Weiss, Mitchell/A-1245-2013","Paw, Barry/0000-0002-0492-1419","NHLBI NIH HHS [P01 HL032262, R01 HL075714]; NIDDK NIH HHS [K08 DK002593, R01 DK070838]",,,30,277,288,1,25,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,2-Mar,2006,440,7080,,,,,96,100,,10.1038/nature04512,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,017HW,WOS:000235685700047,16511496,No,,,11/20/17

Interferon-gamma-inducible human guanylate binding protein 1 ( hGBP1) belongs to the family of dynamin-related large GTP-binding proteins(2), which share biochemical properties not found in other families of GTP-binding proteins such as nucleotide-dependent oligomerization and fast cooperative GTPase activity(3). hGBP1 has an additional property by which it hydrolyses GTP to GMP in two consecutive cleavage reactions(4,5). Here we show that the isolated aminoterminal G domain of hGBP1 retains the main enzymatic properties of the full-length protein and can cleave GDP directly. Crystal structures of the N-terminal G domain trapped at successive steps along the reaction pathway and biochemical data reveal the molecular basis for nucleotide-dependent homodimerization and cleavage of GTP. Similar to effector binding in other GTP-binding proteins, homodimerization is regulated by structural changes in the switch regions. Homodimerization generates a conformation in which an arginine finger and a serine are oriented for efficient catalysis. Positioning of the substrate for the second hydrolysis step is achieved by a change in nucleotide conformation at the ribose that keeps the guanine base interactions intact and positions the beta-phosphates in the gamma-phosphate-binding site.","Lab Enzymol & Biochim Struct, CNRS, UPR 9063, F-91198 Gif Sur Yvette, France; Max Planck Inst Mol Physiol, Abt Strukturelle Biol, D-44227 Dortmund, Germany","Wittinghofer, A (reprint author), Lab Enzymol & Biochim Struct, CNRS, UPR 9063, Ave Terrasse, F-91198 Gif Sur Yvette, France.",alfred.wittinghofer@mpi-dortmund.mpg.de,"FIP, BM30A/I-5166-2015",,,,,30,107,110,1,10,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,2-Mar,2006,440,7080,,,,,101,104,,10.1038/nature04510,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,017HW,WOS:000235685700048,16511497,No,,,11/20/17

However, little is known about the molecular mechanism by which primary B cells acquire or guard against these lesions. Here we find that translocations between c-myc and the IgH locus (Igh) are induced in primary B cells within hours of expression of the catalytically active form of activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID), an enzyme that deaminates cytosine to produce uracil in DNA(2,3). Translocation also requires uracil DNA glycosylase (UNG), which removes uracil from DNA to create abasic sites that are then processed to double-strand breaks(4,5). The pathway that mediates aberrant joining of c-myc and Igh differs from intrachromosomal repair during immunoglobulin class switch recombination in that it does not require histone H2AX(6), p53 binding protein 1 ( 53BP1)(7,8) or the non-homologous end-joining protein Ku80(9). In addition, translocations are inhibited by the tumour suppressors ATM, Nbs1, p19 (Arf) and p53, which is consistent with activation of DNA damage- and oncogenic stress-induced checkpoints during physiological class switching. Finally, we demonstrate that accumulation of AID-dependent, IgH-associated chromosomal lesions is not sufficient to enhance c-myc-Igh translocations.

Questions in the study of magnetosome formation include understanding the factors governing the size and redox-controlled synthesis of the nano-sized magnetosomes and their assembly into a regular chain in order to achieve the maximum possible magnetic moment, against the physical tendency of magnetosome agglomeration. A deeper understanding of these mechanisms is expected from studying the genes present in the identified chromosomal 'magnetosome island', for which the connection with magnetosome synthesis has become evident(2). Here we use gene deletion in Magnetospirillum gryphiswaldense to show that magnetosome alignment is coupled to the presence of the mamJ gene product. MamJ is an acidic protein associated with a novel filamentous structure, as revealed by fluorescence microscopy and cryoelectron tomography. We suggest a mechanism in which MamJ interacts with the magnetosome surface as well as with a cytoskeleton-like structure.

Two molecules of NpSRII and two molecules of NpHtrII form a 2: 2 complex in membranes as shown by electron paramagnetic resonance(5) and X-ray structure analysis(6). Here we present X-ray structures of the photocycle intermediates K and late M (M(2)) explaining the evolution of the signal in the receptor after retinal isomerization and the transfer of the signal to the transducer in the complex. The formation of late M has been correlated with the formation of the signalling state(2,7). The observed structural rearrangements allow us to propose the following mechanism for the light-induced activation of the signalling complex. On excitation by light, retinal isomerization leads in the K state to a rearrangement of a water cluster that partly disconnects two helices of the receptor. In the transition to late M the changes in the hydrogen bond network proceed further. Thus, in late M state an altered tertiary structure establishes the signalling state of the receptor. The transducer responds to the activation of the receptor by a clockwise rotation of about 158 of helix TM2 and a displacement of this helix by 0.9 angstrom at the cytoplasmic surface.","Forschungszentrum Julich, Inst Struct Biol IBI2, D-52425 Julich, Germany; MIPT, Ctr Biophys & Phys Chem Supramol Struct, Dolgoprudnyi 141700, Russia; Max Planck Inst Mol Physiol, D-44227 Dortmund, Germany","Engelhard, M (reprint author), Forschungszentrum Julich, Inst Struct Biol IBI2, Postfach 1913, D-52425 Julich, Germany.",martin.engelhard@mpi-dortmund.mpg.de,"Klare, Johann/C-1428-2009; Labahn, Jorg/G-9593-2013; Gordeliy, Valentin/J-3636-2013; Buldt, Georg/K-5345-2013; Buldt, Georg/H-9509-2014; Baeken, Chris/E-2074-2013; Efremov, Rouslan/P-9085-2015","Klare, Johann/0000-0002-5761-5968; Labahn, Jorg/0000-0002-0648-8145; Gordeliy, Valentin/0000-0001-5782-5896; Efremov, Rouslan/0000-0001-7516-8658",,,,27,121,124,0,14,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,2-Mar,2006,440,7080,,,,,115,119,,10.1038/nature04520,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,017HW,WOS:000235685700051,16452929,No,,,11/20/17

In the cat primary visual cortex we compare responses to natural inputs with those to noise inputs matched for luminance and contrast. We find that neural filters adaptively change with the input ensemble so as to increase the information carried by the neural response about the filtered stimulus. Adaptation affects the spatial frequency composition of the filter, enhancing sensitivity to under-represented frequencies in agreement with optimal encoding arguments.

Previous searches for other satellites around Pluto have been unsuccessful(5-7), but they were not sensitive to objects less than or similar to 150 km in diameter and there are no fundamental reasons why Pluto should not have more satellites(6). Here we report the discovery of two additional moons around Pluto, provisionally designated S/2005 P1 (hereafter P1) and S/2005 P2 (hereafter P2), which makes Pluto the first Kuiper belt object known to have multiple satellites.

Although definitive orbits cannot be derived, both new satellites appear to be moving in circular orbits in the same orbital plane as Charon, with orbital periods of similar to 38 days (P1) and similar to 25 days (P2).","Johns Hopkins Univ, Appl Phys Lab, Dept Space, Laurel, MD 20723 USA; SW Res Inst, Dept Space Studies, Boulder, CO 80302 USA; Lowell Observ, Flagstaff, AZ 86001 USA; Space Telescope Sci Inst, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA","Weaver, HA (reprint author), Johns Hopkins Univ, Appl Phys Lab, Dept Space, 11100 Johns Hopkins Rd, Laurel, MD 20723 USA.",hal.weaver@jhuapl.edu,"Weaver, Harold/D-9188-2016",,,,,16,81,82,0,3,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,23-Feb,2006,439,7079,,,,,943,945,,10.1038/nature04547,,3,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,014NE,WOS:000235486100039,16495991,No,,,11/20/17

This discovery, combined with the constraints on the absence of more distant satellites of Pluto(2), reveal that Pluto and its moons comprise an unusual, highly compact, quadruple system. These facts naturally raise the question of how this puzzling satellite system came to be. Here we show that P1 and P2's proximity to Pluto and Charon, the fact that P1 and P2 are on near-circular orbits in the same plane as Pluto's large satellite Charon(1), along with their apparent locations in or near high-order mean-motion resonances, all probably result from their being constructed from collisional ejecta that originated from the Pluto-Charon formation event.

Counterfactual computation constitutes a striking example: the potential outcome of a quantum computation can be inferred, even if the computer is not run(1). Relying on similar arguments to interaction-free measurements(2) (or quantum interrogation(3)), counterfactual computation is accomplished by putting the computer in a superposition of 'running' and 'not running' states, and then interfering the two histories. Conditional on the as-yet-unknown outcome of the computation, it is sometimes possible to counterfactually infer information about the solution. Here we demonstrate counterfactual computation, implementing Grover's search algorithm with an all-optical approach(4). It was believed that the overall probability of such counterfactual inference is intrinsically limited(1,5), so that it could not perform better on average than random guesses. However, using a novel 'chained' version of the quantum Zeno effect(6), we show how to boost the counterfactual inference probability to unity, thereby beating the random guessing limit. Our methods are general and apply to any physical system, as illustrated by a discussion of trapped-ion systems. Finally, we briefly show that, in certain circumstances, counterfactual computation can eliminate errors induced by decoherence.","Univ Illinois, Dept Phys, Urbana, IL 61801 USA","Hosten, O (reprint author), Univ Illinois, Dept Phys, 1110 W Green St, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.",hosten@uiuc.edu,"Rakher, Matthew/C-2287-2011; Peters, Nicholas/F-2530-2010","Rakher, Matthew/0000-0002-4490-4197; Peters, Nicholas/0000-0002-7215-9630",,,,17,86,86,1,24,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,23-Feb,2006,439,7079,,,,,949,952,,10.1038/nature04523,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,014NE,WOS:000235486100041,16495993,No,,,11/20/17

If the interface between the nanostructure and the superconductors is sufficiently transparent, a dissipationless current (supercurrent) can flow through the device owing to the Josephson effect(4,5). A Josephson coupling, as measured by the zero-resistance supercurrent, has been obtained using tunnel barriers, superconducting constrictions, normal metals and semiconductors. The coupling mechanisms vary from tunnelling to Andreev reflection(5-8). The latter process has hitherto been observed only in normal-type systems with a continuous density of electronic states. Here we investigate a supercurrent flowing through a discrete density of states-that is, the quantized single particle energy states of a quantum dot(9), or 'artificial atom', placed between superconducting electrodes. For this purpose, we exploit the quantum properties of finite-sized carbon nanotubes(10). By means of a gate electrode, successive discrete energy states are tuned on- and off-resonance with the Fermi energy in the superconducting leads, resulting in a periodic modulation of the critical current and a non-trivial correlation between the conductance in the normal state and the supercurrent. We find, in good agreement with existing theory(11), that the product of the critical current and the normal state resistance becomes an oscillating function, in contrast to being constant as in previously explored regimes.","Delft Univ Technol, Kavli Inst Neurosci, NL-2600 GA Delft, Netherlands","Jarillo-Herrero, P (reprint author), Delft Univ Technol, Kavli Inst Neurosci, POB 5046, NL-2600 GA Delft, Netherlands.",Pablo@qt.tn.tudelft.nl,,,,,,30,242,242,5,72,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,23-Feb,2006,439,7079,,,,,953,956,,10.1038/nature04550,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,014NE,WOS:000235486100042,16495994,No,,,11/20/17

In the early Earth, during its formation and segregation into rocky mantle and iron-rich core, it is likely that silicate liquids played a large part in the transport of volatiles to or from the deep interior. The importance of aluminium on solubility mechanisms at high pressure has so far received little attention, even though aluminium has long been recognized as exerting strong control on liquid structures at ambient conditions(4-6). Here we present constraints on the solubility of argon in aluminosilicate melt compositions up to 25 GPa and 3,000 K, using a laser-heated diamond-anvil cell. The argon contents reach a maximum that persists to pressures as high as 17 GPa (up to 500 km deep in an early magma ocean), well above that expected on the basis of Al-free melt experiments. A distinct drop in argon solubility observed over a narrow pressure range correlates well with the expected void loss in the melt structure predicted by recent molecular dynamics simulations(7-9). These results provide a process for noble gas sequestration in the mantle at various depths in a cooling magma ocean. The concept of shallow partial melting as a unique process for extracting noble gases from the early Earth, thereby defining the initial atmospheric abundance, may therefore be oversimplified.","Univ Oxford, Dept Earth Sci, Oxford OX1 3PR, England; Diamond Light Source Ltd, Didcot OX11 0QX, Oxon, England","Bouhifd, MA (reprint author), Univ Oxford, Dept Earth Sci, Parks Rd, Oxford OX1 3PR, England.",alib@earth.ox.ac.uk; andrew@earth.ox.ac.uk,,,,,,29,23,23,4,27,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,23-Feb,2006,439,7079,,,,,961,964,,10.1038/nature04583,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,014NE,WOS:000235486100044,16495996,No,,,11/20/17

Traditionally, cephalochordates are considered as the closest living relatives of vertebrates, with tunicates representing the earliest chordate lineage(1,2). This view is mainly justified by overall morphological similarities and an apparently increased complexity in cephalochordates and vertebrates relative to tunicates(2). Despite their critical importance for understanding the origins of vertebrates(3), phylogenetic studies of chordate relationships have provided equivocal results(4-7). Taking advantage of the genome sequencing of the appendicularian Oikopleura dioica, we assembled a phylogenomic data set of 146 nuclear genes (33,800 unambiguously aligned amino acids) from 14 deuterostomes and 24 other slowly evolving species as an outgroup. Here we show that phylogenetic analyses of this data set provide compelling evidence that tunicates, and not cephalochordates, represent the closest living relatives of vertebrates. Chordate monophyly remains uncertain because cephalochordates, albeit with a non-significant statistical support, surprisingly grouped with echinoderms, a hypothesis that needs to be tested with additional data. This new phylogenetic scheme prompts a reappraisal of both morphological and palaeontological data and has important implications for the interpretation of developmental and genomic studies in which tunicates and cephalochordates are used as model animals.","Univ Montreal, Ctr Robert Cedergren, Dept Biochim, Montreal, PQ H3C 3J7, Canada; Univ Bergen, Bergen High Technol Ctr, Sars Ctr Marine Mol Biol, N-5008 Bergen, Norway","Philippe, H (reprint author), Univ Montreal, Ctr Robert Cedergren, Dept Biochim, Succursale Ctr Ville, Montreal, PQ H3C 3J7, Canada.",herve.philippe@umontreal.ca,"Delsuc, Frederic/B-4381-2009","Delsuc, Frederic/0000-0002-6501-6287",,,,30,875,913,1,84,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,23-Feb,2006,439,7079,,,,,965,968,,10.1038/nature04336,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,014NE,WOS:000235486100045,16495997,No,,,11/20/17

Although much is known about how parasitic plants influence host peformance(1-4), their role as drivers of community- and ecosystem-level properties remains largely unexplored(5). Parasitic plants have the potential to influence directly the productivity and structure of plant communities because they cause harm to particular host plants, indirectly increasing the competitive status of non-host species(6-10). Such parasite-driven above-ground effects might also have important indirect consequences through altering the quantity and quality of resources that enter soil, thereby affecting the activity of decomposer organisms(3,11-13). Here we show in model grassland communities that the parasitic plant Rhinanthus minor, which occurs widely throughout Europe and North America(14), has strong direct effects on above-ground community properties, increasing plant diversity and reducing productivity. We also show that these direct effects of R. minor on the plant community have marked indirect effects on below-ground properties, ultimately increasing rates of nitrogen cycling.

Instead, almost all FSHD patients carry deletions of an integral number of tandem 3.3-kilobase repeat units, termed D4Z4, located on chromosome 4q35 (ref. 3). D4Z4 contains a transcriptional silencer whose deletion leads to inappropriate overexpression in FSHD skeletal muscle of 4q35 genes located upstream of D4Z4 ( ref. 4). To identify the gene responsible for FSHD pathogenesis, we generated transgenic mice selectively overexpressing in skeletal muscle the 4q35 genes FRG1, FRG2 or ANT1. We find that FRG1 transgenic mice develop a muscular dystrophy with features characteristic of the human disease; by contrast, FRG2 and ANT1 transgenic mice seem normal. FRG1 is a nuclear protein and several lines of evidence suggest it is involved in pre-messenger RNA splicing(5-7). We find that in muscle of FRG1 transgenic mice and FSHD patients, specific pre-mRNAs undergo aberrant alternative splicing.

Here we show that, for natural sounds, the complete acoustic waveform can be represented efficiently with a nonlinear model based on a population spike code. In this model, idealized spikes encode the precise temporal positions and magnitudes of underlying acoustic features. We find that when the features are optimized for coding either natural sounds or speech, they show striking similarities to time-domain cochlear filter estimates, have a frequency-bandwidth dependence similar to that of auditory nerve fibres, and yield significantly greater coding efficiency than conventional signal representations.

We show that connections between mossy fibres and granule cells can sustain high-frequency signalling at physiological temperature. We use fluctuation analysis(7) and pharmacological block of desensitization to identify the quantal determinants of short-term plasticity and combine these with a short-term plasticity model and cumulative excitatory postsynaptic current analysis to quantify the determinants of sustained high-frequency transmission.

Many disorders promote damage to and eventual loss of the myelin sheath, which often results in significant neurological morbidity. However, little is known about the fundamental mechanisms that initiate myelin damage, with the assumption being that its fate follows that of the parent oligodendrocyte. Here we show that NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) glutamate receptors mediate Ca2+ accumulation in central myelin in response to chemical ischaemia in vitro. Using two-photon microscopy, we imaged fluorescence of the Ca2+ indicator X-rhod-1 loaded into oligodendrocytes and the cytoplasmic compartment of the myelin sheath in adult rat optic nerves. The AMPA (alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid)/kainate receptor antagonist NBQX(2) completely blocked the ischaemic Ca2+ increase in oligodendroglial cell bodies, but only modestly reduced the Ca2+ increase in myelin. In contrast, the Ca2+ increase in myelin was abolished by broad-spectrum NMDA receptor antagonists (MK-801, 7-chlorokynurenic acid, D-AP5(3,4)), but not by more selective blockers of NR2A and NR2B subunit-containing receptors (NVP-AAM077(5) and ifenprodil(2,4)). In vitro ischaemia causes ultrastructural damage to both axon cylinders and myelin(6). NMDA receptor antagonism greatly reduced the damage to myelin. NR1, NR2 and NR3 subunits were detected in myelin by immunohistochemistry and immunoprecipitation, indicating that all necessary subunits are present for the formation of functional NMDA receptors. Our data show that the mature myelin sheath can respond independently to injurious stimuli. Given that axons are known to release glutamate(7-9), our finding that the Ca2+ increase was mediated in large part by activation of myelinic NMDA receptors suggests a new mechanism of axo-myelinic signalling. Such a mechanism may represent a potentially important therapeutic target in disorders in which demyelination is a prominent feature, such as multiple sclerosis, neurotrauma, infections (for example, HIV encephalomyelopathy) and aspects of ischaemic brain injury.","Univ Ottawa, Ottawa Hlth Res Inst, Div Neurosci, Ottawa, ON K1Y 4K9, Canada; Univ Ottawa, Dept Cellular & Mol Med, Ottawa, ON K1Y 4K9, Canada; Cleveland Clin Fdn, Dept Neurosci, Cleveland, OH 44195 USA; Univ Calgary, Hotchkiss Brain Inst, Dept Physiol & Biophys, Calgary, AB T2N 4N1, Canada","Stys, PK (reprint author), Univ Ottawa, Ottawa Hlth Res Inst, Div Neurosci, Ottawa, ON K1Y 4K9, Canada.",pstys@ohri.ca,,"Micu, Ileana/0000-0001-7112-0075; Zamponi, Gerald/0000-0002-0644-9066",,,,30,292,305,0,19,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,23-Feb,2006,439,7079,,,,,988,992,,10.1038/nature04474,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,014NE,WOS:000235486100050,16372019,No,,,11/20/17

Evidence from both in vitro and in vivo experiments suggests that mammary cell differentiation is a hierarchical process originating in an uncommitted stem cell with self-renewal potential(2-4). However, analysis of the properties and regulation of mammary stem cells has been limited by a lack of methods for their prospective isolation. Here we report the use of multiparameter cell sorting and limiting dilution transplant analysis to demonstrate the purification of a rare subset of adult mouse mammary cells that are able individually to regenerate an entire mammary gland within 6 weeks in vivo while simultaneously executing up to ten symmetrical self-renewal divisions. These mammary stem cells are phenotypically distinct from and give rise to mammary epithelial progenitor cells that produce adherent colonies in vitro. The mammary stem cells are also a rapidly cycling population in the normal adult and have molecular features indicative of a basal position in the mammary epithelium.","British Columbia Canc Agcy, Terry Fox Lab, Vancouver, BC V5Z 1L3, Canada; British Columbia Canc Agcy, Michael Smith Genome Sci Ctr, Vancouver, BC V5Z 1L3, Canada; StemCell Technol Inc, Vancouver, BC V5Z 1B3, Canada; Royal Melbourne Hosp, Walter & Eliza Hall Inst Med Res, WEHI Biotechnol Ctr, Parkville, Vic 3050, Australia; Univ British Columbia, Dept Med Genet, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z3, Canada; Univ British Columbia, Dept Pathol & Lab Med, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z3, Canada; Univ British Columbia, Dept Med, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z3, Canada","Eaves, CJ (reprint author), British Columbia Canc Agcy, Terry Fox Lab, 601 W 10th Ave, Vancouver, BC V5Z 1L3, Canada.",ceaves@bccrc.ca,,,,,,29,950,985,8,67,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,23-Feb,2006,439,7079,,,,,993,997,,10.1038/nature04496,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,014NE,WOS:000235486100051,16395311,No,,,11/20/17

Internalization of proteins, lipids and other cargo can occur by one of several pathways that have different, but often overlapping, molecular requirements(1-5). To mediate endocytosis, effectors assemble transiently underneath the plasma membrane, carry out the mechanics of membrane deformation, cargo selection and vesicle internalization, and then disassemble. The mechanism by which endocytosis initiates at particular locations on the plasma membrane has remained unknown. Sites of endocytosis might be formed randomly, induced by stochastic protein and/or lipid clustering. Alternatively, endocytosis might initiate at specific locations. Here we describe large immobile protein assemblies at the plasma membrane in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae that mark endocytic sites. These structures, termed eisosomes (from the Greek 'eis', meaning into or portal, and 'soma', meaning body), are composed primarily of two cytoplasmic proteins, Pil1 and Lsp1. A plasma membrane protein, Sur7, localizes to eisosomes. These structures colocalize with sites of protein and lipid endocytosis, and their components genetically interact with known endocytic effectors. Loss of Pil1 leads to clustering of eisosome remnants and redirects endocytosis and endocytic effector proteins to these clusters.","Univ Calif San Francisco, Howard Hughes Med Inst, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Biochem & Biophys, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA","Walther, TC (reprint author), Univ Calif San Francisco, Howard Hughes Med Inst, 600 16th St, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA.",twalther@itsa.ucsf.edu,"Aguilar, Pablo/E-4576-2010","Aguilar, Pablo/0000-0002-9312-2474; Brickner, Jason/0000-0001-8019-3743",,,,30,180,186,2,13,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,23-Feb,2006,439,7079,,,,,998,1003,,10.1038/nature04472,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,014NE,WOS:000235486100052,16496001,No,,,11/20/17

In the apicomplexan parasite Plasmodium falciparum, responsible for the severe form of malaria in humans, this is exemplified by antigenic variation of the highly polymorphic P. falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein 1 ( PfEMP1)(1,2). PfEMP1, encoded by the 60-member var gene family(3-6), represents a major virulence factor due to its central role in immune evasion and intravascular parasite sequestration. Mutually exclusive expression of PfEMP1 is controlled by epigenetic mechanisms involving chromatin modification and perinuclear var locus repositioning(7,8). Here we show that a var promoter mediates the nucleation and spreading of stably inherited silenced chromatin. Transcriptional activation of this promoter occurs at the nuclear periphery in association with chromosome-end clusters. Additionally, the var promoter sequence is sufficient to infiltrate a transgene into the allelic exclusion programme of var gene expression, as transcriptional activation of this transgene results in silencing of endogenous var gene transcription. These results show that a var promoter is sufficient for epigenetic silencing and mono-allelic transcription of this virulence gene family, and are fundamental for our understanding of antigenic variation in P. falciparum. Furthermore, the PfEMP1 knockdown parasites obtained in this study will be important tools to increase our understanding of P. falciparum-mediated virulence and immune evasion.","Royal Melbourne Hosp, Walter & Eliza Hall Inst Med Res, Parkville, Vic 3050, Australia; Monash Univ, Dept Microbiol, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia; Univ Melbourne, Royal Melbourne Hosp, Dept Med, Parkville, Vic 3050, Australia; Papua New Guinea Inst Med Res, Goroka EHP 441, Papua N Guinea","Cowman, AF (reprint author), Royal Melbourne Hosp, Walter & Eliza Hall Inst Med Res, Parkville, Vic 3050, Australia.",cowman@wehi.edu.au,"Jackson, Allison/D-6528-2012; Duffy, Michael/A-8618-2012; Cowman, Alan/C-7642-2013; Crabb, Brendan/F-5287-2013","Jackson, Allison/0000-0002-9614-6471; Duffy, Michael/0000-0001-5635-4033; Cowman, Alan/0000-0001-5145-9004; Reeder, John/0000-0003-1395-1289",Wellcome Trust,,,29,167,172,0,16,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,23-Feb,2006,439,7079,,,,,1004,1008,,10.1038/nature04407,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,014NE,WOS:000235486100053,16382237,No,,,11/20/17

In multicellular organisms, however, additional control mechanisms regulate the cell cycle to specify the size of the organism and its constituent organs(1). To identify such genes, here we analysed the effect of the loss of function of 70% of Drosophila genes (including 90% of genes conserved in human) on cell-cycle progression of S2 cells using flow cytometry. To address redundancy, we also targeted genes involved in protein phosphorylation simultaneously with their homologues. We identify genes that control cell size, cytokinesis, cell death and/or apoptosis, and the G1 and G2/M phases of the cell cycle. Classification of the genes into pathways by unsupervised hierarchical clustering on the basis of these phenotypes shows that, in addition to classical regulatory mechanisms such asMyc/Max, Cyclin/Cdk and E2F, cell-cycle progression in S2 cells is controlled by vesicular and nuclear transport proteins, COP9 signalosome activity and four extracellular-signal-regulated pathways (Wnt, p38 beta MAPK, FRAP/TOR and JAK/STAT). In addition, by simultaneously analysing several phenotypes, we identify a translational regulator, eIF-3p66, that specifically affects the Cyclin/Cdk pathway activity.","Univ Helsinki, Biomedicum Helsinki, Mol & Canc Biol Program, FI-00014 Helsinki, Finland; Univ Helsinki, Biomedicum Helsinki, High Throughput Ctr, FI-00014 Helsinki, Finland; Natl Publ Hlth Inst, Dept Mol Med, FI-00251 Helsinki, Finland; Biomedicum, Biomedicum Bioinformat Unit, FI-00251 Helsinki, Finland","Taipale, M (reprint author), Univ Helsinki, Biomedicum Helsinki, Mol & Canc Biol Program, POB 63,Haartmaninkatu 8, FI-00014 Helsinki, Finland.",minna.taipale@helsinki.fi,"Bjorklund, Mikael/D-3362-2009; Varjosalo, Markku/K-6424-2015","Bjorklund, Mikael/0000-0002-2176-681X; Varjosalo, Markku/0000-0002-1340-9732; Taipale, Minna/0000-0002-1905-2551",,,,30,174,177,0,18,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,23-Feb,2006,439,7079,,,,,1009,1013,,10.1038/nature04469,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,014NE,WOS:000235486100054,16496002,No,,,11/20/17

For example, S-RNase-based self-incompatibility prevents inbreeding in diverse angiosperm species. S-RNases are thought to function as specific cytotoxins that inhibit pollen that has an S-haplotype that matches one of those in the pistil. Thus, pollen and pistil factors interact to prevent mating between closely related individuals. Other pistil factors, such as HT-B, 4936-factor and the 120 kDa glycoprotein, are also required for pollen rejection but do not contribute to S-haplotype-specificity per se. Here we show that S-RNase is taken up and sorted to a vacuolar compartment in the pollen tubes. Antibodies to the 120 kDa glycoprotein label the compartment membrane. When the pistil does not express HT-B or 4936-factor, S-RNase remains sequestered, unable to cause rejection. Similarly, in wild-type pistils, compatible pollen tubes degrade HT-B and sequester S-RNase. We suggest that S-RNase trafficking and the stability of HT-B are central to S-specific pollen rejection.","Univ Nacl Cordoba, Fac Ciencias Quim, Dept Quim Biol, CIQUIBIC, RA-5000 Cordoba, Argentina; 105 Life Sci Ctr, Div Biochem, Columbia, MO 65211 USA; Univ Missouri, Div Biol Sci, Columbia, MO 65211 USA; Dept Plant Biol, Athens, GA 30602 USA; Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Fac Quim, Dept Bioquim, Mexico City 04510, DF, Mexico; Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Fac Ciencias, Dept Biol, Mexico City 04510, DF, Mexico","McClure, B (reprint author), Univ Nacl Cordoba, Fac Ciencias Quim, Dept Quim Biol, CIQUIBIC, Ciudad Univ, RA-5000 Cordoba, Argentina.",mcclureb@missouri.edu,"Cruz-Garcia, Felipe/A-5817-2008","Phillips, Thomas/0000-0002-9709-0684",,,,43,144,159,3,27,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,16-Feb,2006,439,7078,,,,,805,810,,10.1038/nature04491,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,012JA,WOS:000235333600040,16482149,No,,,11/20/17

Whereas most covalent histone modifications are reversible, until recently it was unknown whether methyl groups could be actively removed from histones.

In the presence of Fe(II) and alpha-ketoglutarate, JHDM1 demethylates H3-methyl-K36 and generates formaldehyde and succinate. Overexpression of JHDM1 reduced the level of dimethyl-H3-K36 (H3K36me2) in vivo. The demethylase activity of the JmjC domain-containing proteins is conserved, as a JHDM1 homologue in Saccharomyces cerevisiae also has H3-K36 demethylase activity.

Here we report a search for radio sources that vary on much shorter timescales. We found eleven objects characterized by single, dispersed bursts having durations between 2 and 30 ms. The average time intervals between bursts range from 4 min to 3 h with radio emission typically detectable for < 1 s per day. From an analysis of the burst arrival times, we have identified periodicities in the range 0.4 - 7 s for ten of the eleven sources, suggesting origins in rotating neutron stars. Despite the small number of sources detected at present, their ephemeral nature implies a total Galactic population significantly exceeding that of the regularly pulsing radio pulsars. Five of the ten sources have periods > 4 s, and the rate of change of the pulse period has been measured for three of them; for one source, we have inferred a high magnetic field strength of 5 x 10(13) G.

The parent bodies are usually assumed to have formed in the main asteroid belt, which is the source of most meteorites. Observational evidence, however, does not indicate that differentiated bodies or their fragments were ever common there. This view is also difficult to reconcile with the fact that the parent bodies of iron meteorites were as small as 20 km in diameter(2,3) and that they formed 1-2 Myr earlier than the parent bodies of the ordinary chondrites(4-6). Here we show that the iron-meteorite parent bodies most probably formed in the terrestrial planet region. Fast accretion times there allowed small planetesimals to melt early in Solar System history by the decay of short-lived radionuclides ( such as Al-26, Fe-60)(7-9). The protoplanets emerging from this population not only induced collisional evolution among the remaining planetesimals but also scattered some of the survivors into the main belt, where they stayed for billions of years before escaping via a combination of collisions, Yarkovsky thermal forces, and resonances(10). We predict that some asteroids are main-belt interlopers ( such as ( 4) Vesta).

Moreover, theory predicts that the current is always carried by pairs of electrons in a spin singlet state(2), so conventional superconductivity decays very rapidly when in contact with a ferromagnet, which normally prohibits the existence of singlet pairs. It has been predicted that this rapid spatial decay would not occur if spin triplet superconductivity could be induced in the ferromagnet(3,4). Here we report a Josephson supercurrent through the strong ferromagnet CrO2, from which we infer that it is a spin triplet supercurrent. Our experimental set-up is different from those envisaged in the earlier predictions, but we conclude that the underlying physical explanation for our result is a conversion from spin singlet pairs to spin triplets at the interface. The supercurrent can be switched with the direction of the magnetization, analogous to spin valve transistors, and therefore could enable magnetization-controlled Josephson junctions.","Delft Univ Technol, Fac Sci Appl, Kavli Inst Nanosci, NL-2628 CJ Delft, Netherlands; Univ Alabama, MINT Ctr, Tuscaloosa, AL 35487 USA; Brown Univ, Dept Phys, Providence, RI 02912 USA","Keizer, RS (reprint author), Delft Univ Technol, Fac Sci Appl, Kavli Inst Nanosci, NL-2628 CJ Delft, Netherlands.",r.s.keizer@tnw.tudelft.nl; t.m.klapwijk@tnw.tudelft.nl,"Miao, Guo-Xing/A-2411-2008; Xiao, Gang/G-5691-2011","Miao, Guo-Xing/0000-0002-8735-8077; ",,,,23,419,421,7,89,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,16-Feb,2006,439,7078,,,,,825,827,,10.1038/nature04499,,3,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,012JA,WOS:000235333600044,16482152,No,,,11/20/17

They are the key factor that determines mechanical properties such as stability(3), elasticity(4,5) and sound transmission(6,7), which are important for civil engineering and industrial processing. Previous studies have focused on investigations of the global structure of external forces(8-11) ( the boundary condition) and on the probability distribution of individual contact forces(4,12). So far, however, precise knowledge of the disordered spatial structure of the force network has remained elusive. Here we report that molecular dynamics simulations of realistic granular packings reveal scale invariance of clusters of particles interacting by means of relatively strong forces. Despite visual variation, force networks for various values of the confining pressure and other parameters have identical scaling exponents and scaling function, thereby determining a universality class. Unexpectedly, the flat ensemble of force configurations(13-15) (a simple generalization of equilibrium statistical mechanics) belongs to this universality class, whereas some widely studied simplified models(16-18) do not. This implies that the elasticity of the grains and their geometrical disorder do not affect the universal mechanical properties.","Univ Amsterdam, Inst Theoret Phys, NL-1018 XE Amsterdam, Netherlands; Leiden Univ, Inst Lorentz, NL-2300 RA Leiden, Netherlands","Nienhuis, B (reprint author), Univ Amsterdam, Inst Theoret Phys, Valckenierstr 65, NL-1018 XE Amsterdam, Netherlands.",nienhuis@science.uva.nl,"Somfai, Ellak/A-9277-2009","Somfai, Ellak/0000-0002-2218-8855",,,,29,80,81,3,27,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,16-Feb,2006,439,7078,,,,,828,830,,10.1038/nature04549,,3,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,012JA,WOS:000235333600045,16482153,No,,,11/20/17

Here we demonstrate that this is unfounded, and that many ionic liquids can be distilled at low pressure without decomposition. Ionic liquids represent matter solely composed of ions, and so are perceived as non-volatile substances. During the last decade, interest in the field of ionic liquids has burgeoned(3), producing a wealth of intellectual and technological challenges and opportunities for the production of new chemical and extractive processes(4-6), fuel cells and batteries(7), and new composite materials(8,9). Much of this potential is underpinned by their presumed involatility. This characteristic, however, can severely restrict the attainability of high purity levels for ionic liquids ( when they contain poorly volatile components) in recycling schemes, as well as excluding their use in gas-phase processes. We anticipate that our demonstration that some selected families of commonly used aprotic ionic liquids can be distilled at 200 - 300 degrees C and low pressure, with concomitant recovery of significant amounts of pure substance, will permit these currently excluded applications to be realized.","Univ Nova Lisboa, Inst Tecnol Quim & Biol, P-2780901 Oeiras, Portugal; Queens Univ Belfast, QUILL Ctr, Belfast BT9 5AG, Antrim, North Ireland; Natl Inst Stand & Technol, Phys & Chem Properties Div, Boulder, CO 80305 USA","Rebelo, LPN (reprint author), Univ Nova Lisboa, Inst Tecnol Quim & Biol, Av Republ,Apartado 127, P-2780901 Oeiras, Portugal.",luis.rebelo@itqb.unl.pt,"; Rebelo, Luis Paulo/B-5285-2008; Magee, Joseph/A-8496-2009; Canongia Lopes, Jose Nuno/H-7166-2012; Canongia Lopes, Jose Nuno/B-8109-2008; Esperanca, Jose/B-5116-2008","Rebelo, Luis Paulo/0000-0002-5247-2443; Magee, Joseph/0000-0002-9312-8593; Canongia Lopes, Jose Nuno/0000-0002-4483-6294; Esperanca, Jose/0000-0001-9615-8678; Canon Lop, Jos Nun/0000-0003-1527-105X",,,,21,1213,1237,44,437,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,16-Feb,2006,439,7078,,,,,831,834,,10.1038/nature04451,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,012JA,WOS:000235333600046,16482154,No,,,11/20/17

Possible reasons for the increase include: climate change and variability, deforestation, solar dimming(4), and direct atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) effects on plant transpiration(5). All of these mechanisms have the potential to affect precipitation and/or evaporation and thereby modify runoff. Here we use a mechanistic land-surface model(6) and optimal fingerprinting statistical techniques(7) to attribute observational runoff changes(1) into contributions due to these factors. The model successfully captures the climate-driven inter-annual runoff variability, but twentieth-century climate alone is insufficient to explain the runoff trends. Instead we find that the trends are consistent with a suppression of plant transpiration due to CO2-induced stomatal closure. This result will affect projections of freshwater availability, and also represents the detection of a direct CO2 effect on the functioning of the terrestrial biosphere.","Hadley Ctr Climate Predict & Res JCHMR, Met Off, Wallingford OX10 8BB, Oxon, England; Winfrith Technol Ctr, Ctr Ecol & Hydrol Dorset, Dorchester DT2 8ZD, Dorchester, England; Hadley Ctr Climate Predict & Res, Met Off, Exeter EX1 3PB, Devon, England; Ctr Ecol & Hydrol Wallingford, Wallingford OX10 8BB, Oxon, England; Univ Reading, Hadley Ctr Climate Predict & Res, Reading Unit, Met Off, Reading RG6 6BB, Berks, England","Gedney, N (reprint author), Hadley Ctr Climate Predict & Res JCHMR, Met Off, Maclean Bldg, Wallingford OX10 8BB, Oxon, England.",nicola.gedney@metoffice.gov.uk,"Boucher, Olivier/J-5810-2012; Boucher, Olivier/K-7483-2012; Betts, Richard/P-8976-2015; Stott, Peter/N-1228-2016; Cox, Peter/B-3299-2012; Huntingford, Chris/A-4307-2008","Boucher, Olivier/0000-0003-2328-5769; Boucher, Olivier/0000-0003-2328-5769; Stott, Peter/0000-0003-4853-7686; Huntingford, Chris/0000-0002-5941-7770",,,,30,443,461,6,144,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,16-Feb,2006,439,7078,,,,,835,838,,10.1038/nature04504,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,012JA,WOS:000235333600047,16482155,No,,,11/20/17

A number of Cenozoic fossil snakes from Australia have vertebral morphology diagnostic of an extinct group, Madtsoiidae, that was widespread in Gondwana from mid-Cretaceous (Cenomanian) to Eocene times, and also reached Europe in the late Cretaceous period(3,7-11). Despite this long history, only about half the skull is known from the best-known species Wonambi naracoortensis(7,11-13), and the few known cranial elements of other species have added little further evidence for phylogenetic relationships(10,14-19). Conflicting hypotheses have been proposed for their relationships and evolutionary significance, either as basal ophidians with many ancestral (varanoid- or mosasaur-like) features, or advanced (macrostomatan) alethinophidians of little relevance to snake origins(3,4,7,11-15,20). Here I report two partial skeletons referred to Yurlunggur(8), from the late Oligocene and early Miocene of northern Australia, which together represent almost the complete skull and mandible. The exceptionally preserved skulls provide new evidence linking Yurlunggur with Wonambi and other madtsoiids, falsifying predictions of the macrostomatan hypothesis, and supporting the exclusion of Madtsoiidae from the clade including all extant snakes.","Outback Isa, Riversleigh Fossil Ctr, Mt Isa, Qld 4825, Australia; S Australian Museum, Adelaide, SA 5000, Australia","Scanlon, JD (reprint author), Outback Isa, Riversleigh Fossil Ctr, POB 1094, Mt Isa, Qld 4825, Australia.",riversleigh@outbackatisa.com.au,,,,,,30,35,35,0,3,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,16-Feb,2006,439,7078,,,,,839,842,,10.1038/nature04137,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,012JA,WOS:000235333600048,16482156,No,,,11/20/17

For three decades, European badgers (Meles meles) have been culled by the British government in a series of attempts to limit the spread of Mycobacterium bovis, the causative agent of bovine tuberculosis (TB), to cattle(1). Despite these efforts, the incidence of TB in cattle has risen consistently, re-emerging as a primary concern for Britain's cattle industry. Recently, badger culling has attracted controversy because experimental studies have reached contrasting conclusions ( albeit using different protocols), with culled areas showing either markedly reduced(2,3) or increased(4,5) incidence of TB in cattle. This has confused attempts to develop a science-based management policy. Here we use data from a large-scale, randomized field experiment to help resolve these apparent differences. We show that, as carried out in this experiment, culling reduces cattle TB incidence in the areas that are culled, but increases incidence in adjoining areas. These findings are biologically consistent with previous studies(2-5) but will present challenges for policy development.","Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Fac Med, Dept Infect Dis Epidemiol, London W2 1PG, England; Dept Environm Food & Rural Affairs, Independent Sci Grp Cattle TB, London SW1P 4PQ, England; Univ Calif Davis, Dept Wildlife Fish & Conservat Biol, Davis, CA 95616 USA; Univ Oxford Nuffield Coll, Oxford OX1 1NF, England; Cent Sci Lab, York YO41 1LZ, N Yorkshire, England; Vet Labs Agcy, Addlestone KT15 3NB, Surrey, England; Univ Strathclyde, Dept Stat & Modelling Sci, Glasgow G1 1XH, Lanark, Scotland; Univ Exeter, Ctr Rural Res, Exeter EX4 6TL, Devon, England; Univ Edinburgh, Royal Dick Sch Vet Studies, Ctr Trop Vet Med, Roslin EH25 9RG, Midlothian, Scotland","Donnelly, CA (reprint author), Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Fac Med, Dept Infect Dis Epidemiol, St Marys Campus,Norfolk Pl, London W2 1PG, England.",c.donnelly@imperial.ac.uk,"Clifton-Hadley, Richard/C-2503-2011; Gao, Wei/G-8653-2011; APHA, Staff publications/E-6082-2010","Gao, Wei/0000-0001-8298-3415; Donnelly, Christl/0000-0002-0195-2463; Rehman, Andrea/0000-0001-9967-5822",,,,25,207,207,7,227,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,16-Feb,2006,439,7078,,,,,843,846,,10.1038/nature04454,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,012JA,WOS:000235333600049,16357869,No,,,11/20/17

Bacteria in this environment were recently shown to contain photoproteins called proteorhodopsins, thought to contribute to cellular energy metabolism by catalysing light-driven proton translocation across the cell membrane(1-7). So far, proteorhodopsin genes have been well documented only in proteobacteria and a few other bacterial groups. Here we report the presence and distribution of proteorhodopsin genes in Archaea affiliated with the order Thermoplasmatales, in the ocean's upper water column. The genomic context and phylogenetic relationships of the archaeal and proteobacterial proteorhodopsins indicate its probable lateral transfer between planktonic Bacteria and Archaea. About 10% of the euryarchaeotes in the photic zone contained the proteorhodopsin gene adjacent to their small-subunit ribosomal RNA. The archaeal proteorhodopsins were also found in other genomic regions, in the same or in different microbial lineages. Although euryarchaeotes were distributed throughout the water column, their proteorhodopsins were found only in the photic zone. The cosmopolitan phylogenetic distribution of proteorhodopsins reflects their significant light-dependent fitness contributions, which drive the photoprotein's lateral acquisition and retention, but constrain its dispersal to the photic zone.","MIT, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; MIT, Div Biol Engn, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA","DeLong, EF (reprint author), MIT, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Bldg 48,15 Vassar St, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",delong@mit.edu,"Frigaard, Niels-Ulrik/H-1277-2011","Frigaard, Niels-Ulrik/0000-0002-9389-8109; Mincer, Tracy/0000-0002-4644-5609",,,,30,181,195,1,36,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,16-Feb,2006,439,7078,,,,,847,850,,10.1038/nature04435,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,012JA,WOS:000235333600050,16482157,No,,,11/20/17

Variation in gene copy number is increasingly recognized as a source of inter-individual differences in genome sequence and has been proposed as a driving force for genome evolution and phenotypic variation(3-5). Here we show that copy number variation of the orthologous rat and human Fcgr3 genes is a determinant of susceptibility to immunologically mediated glomerulonephritis. Positional cloning identified loss of the newly described, rat-specific Fcgr3 paralogue, Fcgr3-related sequence (Fcgr3-rs), as a determinant of macrophage overactivity and glomerulonephritis in Wistar Kyoto rats. In humans, low copy number of FCGR3B, an orthologue of rat Fcgr3, was associated with glomerulonephritis in the autoimmune disease systemic lupus erythematosus. The finding that gene copy number polymorphism predisposes to immunologically mediated renal disease in two mammalian species provides direct evidence for the importance of genome plasticity in the evolution of genetically complex phenotypes, including susceptibility to common human disease.","Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, MRC, Ctr Clin Sci, Physiol Genom & Med Grp, London W12 0NN, England; Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Rheumatol Sect, London W12 0NN, England; Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Sect Renal Med, London W12 0NN, England; Wellcome Trust Ctr Human Genet, Oxford OX3 7BN, England; Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Dept Histopathol, London W12 0NN, England","Aitman, TJ (reprint author), Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, MRC, Ctr Clin Sci, Physiol Genom & Med Grp, London W12 0NN, England.",t.aitman@csc.mrc.ac.uk; t.h.cook@imperial.ac.uk,,"Hodges, Matthew David John/0000-0002-6815-751X","Medical Research Council [MC_U120097112, G0400116, MC_U120061454]; Wellcome Trust",,,30,492,518,1,19,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,16-Feb,2006,439,7078,,,,,851,855,,10.1038/nature04489,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,012JA,WOS:000235333600051,16482158,No,,,11/20/17

If simple, well-characterized modules can be coupled together into more complex networks with behaviour that can be predicted from that of the individual components, we may begin to build an understanding of cellular regulatory processes from the 'bottom up'. Here we have engineered a promoter to allow simultaneous repression and activation of gene expression in Escherichia coli. We studied its behaviour in synthetic gene networks under increasingly complex conditions: unregulated, repressed, activated, and simultaneously repressed and activated. We develop a stochastic model that quantitatively captures the means and distributions of the expression from the engineered promoter of this modular system, and show that the model can be extended and used to accurately predict the in vivo behaviour of the network when it is expanded to include positive feedback. The model also reveals the counterintuitive prediction that noise in protein expression levels can increase upon arrest of cell growth and division, which we confirm experimentally. This work shows that the properties of regulatory subsystems can be used to predict the behaviour of larger, more complex regulatory networks, and that this bottom-up approach can provide insights into gene regulation.","Boston Univ, Ctr Biodynam, Bioinformat Program, Dept Biomed Engn, Boston, MA 02215 USA; Univ N Carolina, Dept Stat & Operat Res, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA; Univ N Carolina, Dept Math, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA; Univ N Carolina, Dept Pharmacol, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA; Univ Toronto, Inst Opt Sci, Mississauga, ON L5L 1C6, Canada; Univ Toronto, Dept Chem & Phys Sci, Mississauga, ON L5L 1C6, Canada; Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Bioengn, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA","Collins, JJ (reprint author), Boston Univ, Ctr Biodynam, Bioinformat Program, Dept Biomed Engn, 44 Cummington St, Boston, MA 02215 USA.",jcollins@bu.edu,"Wang, Xiao/A-8414-2008","Wang, Xiao/0000-0002-4056-0155; McMillen, David/0000-0003-2676-5450",,,,30,218,229,2,35,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,16-Feb,2006,439,7078,,,,,856,860,,10.1038/nature04473,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,012JA,WOS:000235333600052,16482159,No,,,11/20/17

Here we combine computational modelling(11-18) with fluorescence data generated from multiple promoter - gene inserts in Saccharomyces cerevisiae to identify two major sources of extrinsic variability. One unavoidable source arising from the coupling of gene expression with population dynamics leads to a ubiquitous lower limit for expression variability. A second source, which is modelled as originating from a common upstream transcription factor, exemplifies how regulatory networks can convert noise in upstream regulator expression into extrinsic noise at the output of a target gene(9).

Although we now know a great deal about how the brain analyses visual information, we know little about how visual representations become linked with values. To study this process, we turned to the amygdala, a brain structure implicated in reinforcement learning(1-5). We recorded the activity of individual amygdala neurons in monkeys while abstract images acquired either positive or negative value through conditioning. After monkeys had learned the initial associations, we reversed image value assignments. We examined neural responses in relation to these reversals in order to estimate the relative contribution to neural activity of the sensory properties of images and their conditioned values. Here we show that changes in the values of images modulate neural activity, and that this modulation occurs rapidly enough to account for, and correlates with, monkeys' learning. Furthermore, distinct populations of neurons encode the positive and negative values of visual stimuli. Behavioural and physiological responses to visual stimuli may therefore be based in part on the plastic representation of value provided by the amygdala.","Columbia Univ, Ctr Neurobiol & Behav, New York, NY 10032 USA; Columbia Univ, WM Keck Ctr Brain Plast & Cognit, New York, NY 10032 USA; Columbia Univ, Dept Psychiat, New York, NY 10032 USA","Salzman, CD (reprint author), Columbia Univ, Ctr Neurobiol & Behav, 1051 Riverside Dr,Unit 87, New York, NY 10032 USA.",cds2005@columbia.edu,,"Paton, Joseph/0000-0002-1663-6455","NIMH NIH HHS [K01 MH001724-01A1, K01 MH001724, K01 MH001724-02, K01 MH001724-03, K01 MH001724-04, K01 MH001724-05, K01 MH001724-06]",,,30,481,484,4,38,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,16-Feb,2006,439,7078,,,,,865,870,,10.1038/nature04490,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,012JA,WOS:000235333600054,16482160,No,,,11/20/17

The essential epigenetic systems involved in heritable repression of gene activity are the Polycomb group (PcG) proteins(2,3) and the DNA methylation(4,5) systems. Here we show that the corresponding silencing pathways are mechanistically linked. We find that the PcG protein EZH2 ( Enhancer of Zeste homolog 2) interacts within the context of the Polycomb repressive complexes 2 and 3 (PRC2/3) - with DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) and associates with DNMT activity in vivo. Chromatin immunoprecipitations indicate that binding of DNMTs to several EZH2-repressed genes depends on the presence of EZH2. Furthermore, we show by bisulphite genomic sequencing that EZH2 is required for DNA methylation of EZH2-target promoters. Our results suggest that EZH2 serves as a recruitment platform for DNA methyltransferases, thus highlighting a previously unrecognized direct connection between two key epigenetic repression systems.","Free Univ Brussels, Fac Med, Mol Virol Lab, B-1070 Brussels, Belgium; CNIO, Canc Epigenet Grp, Madrid 28029, Spain; ICREA, E-08003 Barcelona, Spain; CRG, E-08003 Barcelona, Spain; Katholieke Univ Leuven, Fac Geneeskunde, Div Biochem, B-3000 Louvain, Belgium; Free Univ Brussels, Fac Med, Neurophysiol Lab, B-1070 Brussels, Belgium; Univ Lille 1, Inst Biol Lille, Inst Pasteur Lille, CNRS,UMR 8117, F-59021 Lille, France","Fuks, F (reprint author), Free Univ Brussels, Fac Med, Mol Virol Lab, 808 Route Lennik, B-1070 Brussels, Belgium.",ffuks@ulb.ac.be,"Di Croce, Luciano/E-7759-2015; Esteller, Manel/L-5956-2014; jia, xu/A-8386-2016; Fraga, Mario/H-7824-2017","Di Croce, Luciano/0000-0003-3488-6228; Esteller, Manel/0000-0003-4490-6093; Bernard, David/0000-0002-1557-2074; Morey, Lluis/0000-0001-9851-4066; Mirjolet Didelot, Celine/0000-0003-0047-9421; Vire, Emmanuelle/0000-0002-7868-9923",ICREA,,,27,1174,1239,11,149,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,16-Feb,2006,439,7078,,,,,871,874,,10.1038/nature04431,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,012JA,WOS:000235333600055,16357870,No,,,11/20/17

Most kinesin motors, exemplified by Kinesin-1, move towards the microtubule plus end, and the structural changes that govern this directional preference have been described(3-5). By contrast, the nature and timing of the structural changes underlying the minus-end-directed motility of Kinesin-14 motors (such as Drosophila Ncd(6,7)) are less well understood. Using cryo-electron microscopy, here we demonstrate that a coiled-coil mechanical element of microtubule-bound Ncd rotates similar to 70 degrees towards the minus end upon ATP binding. Extending or shortening this coiled coil increases or decreases velocity, respectively, without affecting ATPase activity. An unusual Ncd mutant that lacks directional preference(8) shows unstable nucleotide-dependent conformations of its coiled coil, underscoring the role of this mechanical element in motility. These results show that the force-producing conformational change in Ncd occurs on ATP binding, as in other kinesins, but involves the swing of a lever-arm mechanical element similar to that described for myosins.","Univ Calif San Francisco, Howard Hughes Med Inst, San Francisco, CA 94107 USA; Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Mol & Cellular Pharmacol, San Francisco, CA 94107 USA; Scripps Res Inst, Dept Cell Biol, Ctr Integrat Mol Biosci, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA","Vale, RD (reprint author), Univ Calif San Francisco, Howard Hughes Med Inst, 600 16th St, San Francisco, CA 94107 USA.",vale@cmp.ucsf.edu,,,"Howard Hughes Medical Institute; NIAMS NIH HHS [P01 AR042895, P01 AR042895-130005]",,,30,69,71,1,7,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,16-Feb,2006,439,7078,,,,,875,878,,10.1038/nature04320,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,012JA,WOS:000235333600056,16382238,No,,,11/20/17

Escherichia coli AlkB(3-9) and the homologous human proteins ABH2 and ABH3 (refs 5, 7) promiscuously repair DNA and RNA bases damaged by S(N)2 alkylation reagents, which attach hydrocarbons to endocyclic ring nitrogen atoms (N1 of adenine and guanine and N3 of thymine and cytosine)(3,4,10-15). Although the role of AlkB in DNA repair has long been established based on phenotypic studies, its exact biochemical activity was only elucidated recently after sequence profile analysis revealed it to be a member of the Fe-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase superfamily. These enzymes use an Fe(II) cofactor and 2-oxoglutarate co-substrate to oxidize organic substrates. AlkB hydroxylates an alkylated nucleotide base to produce an unstable product that releases an aldehyde to regenerate the unmodified base. Here we have determined crystal structures of substrate and product complexes of E. coli AlkB at resolutions from 1.8 to 2.3 angstrom. Whereas the Fe-2-oxoglutarate dioxygenase core matches that in other superfamily members, a unique subdomain holds a methylated trinucleotide substrate into the active site through contacts to the polynucleotide backbone. Amide hydrogen exchange studies and crystallographic analyses suggest that this substrate-binding 'lid' is conformationally flexible, which may enable docking of diverse alkylated nucleotide substrates in optimal catalytic geometry. Different crystal structures show open and closed states of a tunnel putatively gating O(2) diffusion into the active site. Exposing crystals of the anaerobic Michaelis complex to air yields slow but substantial oxidation of 2-oxoglutarate that is inefficiently coupled to nucleotide oxidation. These observations suggest that protein dynamics modulate redox chemistry and that a hypothesized migration of the reactive oxy-ferryl ligand on the catalytic Fe ion may be impeded when the protein is constrained in the crystal lattice.","Columbia Univ, Dept Biol Sci, New York, NY 10027 USA; Columbia Univ, Fairchild Ctr 702A, NE Struct Genom Consortium, New York, NY 10027 USA; ExSAR Corp, Monmouth Jct, NJ 08852 USA; Columbia Univ, Dept Chem, New York, NY 10027 USA","Hunt, JF (reprint author), Columbia Univ, Dept Biol Sci, MC2434, New York, NY 10027 USA.",jfhunt@biology.columbia.edu,,"Gibney, Brian/0000-0002-8966-7463",,,,28,140,144,2,22,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,16-Feb,2006,439,7078,,,,,879,884,,10.1038/nature04561,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,012JA,WOS:000235333600057,16482161,No,,,11/20/17

To address this question, we analysed genes expressed in functionally impaired virus-specific CD8 T cells present in mice chronically infected with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus ( LCMV), and compared these with the gene profile of functional memory CD8 T cells. Here we report that PD-1 ( programmed death 1; also known as Pdcd1) was selectively upregulated by the exhausted T cells, and that in vivo administration of antibodies that blocked the interaction of this inhibitory receptor with its ligand, PD-L1 ( also known as B7-H1), enhanced T-cell responses. Notably, we found that even in persistently infected mice that were lacking CD4 T-cell help, blockade of the PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitory pathway had a beneficial effect on the 'helpless' CD8 T cells, restoring their ability to undergo proliferation, secrete cytokines, kill infected cells and decrease viral load. Blockade of the CTLA-4 ( cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4) inhibitory pathway had no effect on either T-cell function or viral control. These studies identify a specific mechanism of T-cell exhaustion and define a potentially effective immunological strategy for the treatment of chronic viral infections.","Emory Univ, Sch Med, Emory Vaccine Ctr, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA; Emory Univ, Sch Med, Dept Microbiol & Immunol, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA; Wistar Inst Anat & Biol, Program Immunol, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Med, Dana Farber Canc Inst,Dept Med Oncol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Dept Med, New York, NY 10021 USA; Brigham & Womens Hosp, Boston, MA 02115 USA; Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Pathol, Boston, MA 02115 USA","Ahmed, R (reprint author), Emory Univ, Sch Med, Emory Vaccine Ctr, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA.",ra@microbio.emory.edu,"masopust, david/B-5027-2008",,,,,30,1833,1964,16,183,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,9-Feb,2006,439,7077,,,,,682,687,,10.1038/nature04444,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,010KH,WOS:000235193100035,16382236,No,,,11/20/17

Surprisingly, electrons accelerated in the opposite direction have been recently observed(2-6). The mechanisms and significance of this anti-earthward acceleration are highly uncertain because only earthward acceleration was traditionally considered, and observations remain limited. It is also unclear whether upward acceleration of the electrons is a necessary part of the auroral process or simply a special feature of Earth's complex space environment. Here we report anti-planetward acceleration of electron beams in Saturn's magnetosphere along field lines that statistically map into regions of aurora. The energy spectrum of these beams is qualitatively similar to the ones observed at Earth, and the energy fluxes in the observed beams are comparable with the energies required to excite Saturn's aurora. These beams, along with the observations at Earth(2-6) and the barely understood electron beams in Jupiter's magnetosphere(7,8), demonstrate that anti-planetward acceleration is a universal feature of aurorae.

When this silicon layer ( the template layer) is very thin, the assumption that an effectively infinite number of atoms contributes to its physical properties no longer applies, and new electronic, mechanical and thermodynamic phenomena arise(1-4), distinct from those of bulk silicon. The development of unusual electronic properties with decreasing layer thickness is particularly important for silicon microelectronic devices, in which (001)-oriented SOI is often used(5-7). Here we show - using scanning tunnelling microscopy, electronic transport measurements, and theory - that electronic conduction in thin SOI( 001) is determined not by bulk dopants but by the interaction of surface or interface electronic energy levels with the 'bulk' band structure of the thin silicon template layer. This interaction enables high-mobility carrier conduction in nanometre-scale SOI; conduction in even the thinnest membranes or layers of Si( 001) is therefore possible, independent of any considerations of bulk doping, provided that the proper surface or interface states are available to enable the thermal excitation of 'bulk' carriers in the silicon layer.","Univ Wisconsin, Madison, WI 53706 USA; Soitec USA, Peabody, MA 01960 USA","Lagally, MG (reprint author), Univ Wisconsin, Madison, WI 53706 USA.",lagally@engr.wisc.edu,"Evans, Paul/A-9260-2009; Celler, George/G-3346-2014; Zhang, Pengpeng/N-9952-2014","Evans, Paul/0000-0003-0421-6792; Celler, George/0000-0001-7871-0684; ",,,,28,139,142,4,76,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,9-Feb,2006,439,7077,,,,,703,706,,10.1038/nature04501,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,010KH,WOS:000235193100039,16467833,No,,,11/20/17

Here we report atomic-scale observations of the initial stages of corrosion of a Cu3Au(111) single crystal alloy within a sulphuric acid solution. We monitor, by in situ X-ray diffraction with picometre-scale resolution, the structure and chemical composition of the electrolyte/alloy interface as the material decomposes. We reveal the microscopic structural changes associated with a general passivation phenomenon of which the origin has been hitherto unclear. We observe the formation of a gold-enriched single-crystal layer that is two to three monolayers thick, and has an unexpected inverted (CBA-) stacking sequence. At higher potentials, we find that this protective passivation layer dewets and pure gold islands are formed; such structures form the templates for the growth of nanoporous metals(2).

Winter respiratory carbon dioxide losses from these ecosystems are high, and over half of the carbon assimilated by photosynthesis in the summer can be lost the following winter(2,3). The amount of winter carbon dioxide loss is potentially susceptible to changes in the depth of the snowpack; a shallower snowpack has less insulation potential, causing colder soil temperatures and potentially lower soil respiration rates. Recent climate analyses have shown widespread declines in the winter snowpack of mountain ecosystems in the western USA and Europe that are coupled to positive temperature anomalies(4-6). Here we study the effect of changes in snow cover on soil carbon cycling within the context of natural climate variation. We use a six-year record of net ecosystem carbon dioxide exchange in a subalpine forest to show that years with a reduced winter snowpack are accompanied by significantly lower rates of soil respiration. Furthermore, we show that the cause of the high sensitivity of soil respiration rate to changes in snow depth is a unique soil microbial community that exhibits exponential growth and high rates of substrate utilization at the cold temperatures that exist beneath the snow. Our observations suggest that a warmer climate may change soil carbon sequestration rates in forest ecosystems owing to changes in the depth of the insulating snow cover.","Univ Colorado, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; Univ Colorado, Ctr Interdisciplinary Res Environm Sci, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; Univ Colorado, Dept Geog, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; Univ Colorado, Inst Arctic & Alpine Res, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; San Diego State Univ, Dept Biol, San Diego, CA 92182 USA; Natl Ctr Atmospher Res, Boulder, CO 80305 USA","Monson, RK (reprint author), Univ Colorado, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Boulder, CO 80309 USA.",Russell.Monson@colorado.edu,"Burns, Sean/A-9352-2008; Schmidt, Steven/G-2771-2010","Burns, Sean/0000-0002-6258-1838; Schmidt, Steven/0000-0002-9175-2085",,,,30,284,326,15,172,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,9-Feb,2006,439,7077,,,,,711,714,,10.1038/nature04555,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,010KH,WOS:000235193100041,16467835,No,,,11/20/17

However, it is now clear that bcd is a unique feature of higher Diptera(2,3). An evolutionarily ancient gene, orthodenticle (otd), has a bcd-like role in the beetle Tribolium(4). Unlike the Bcd gradient, which arises by diffusion of protein from an anteriorly localized messenger RNA(1,5), the Tribolium Otd gradient forms by translational repression of otd mRNA by a posteriorly localized factor. These differences in gradient formation are correlated with differences in modes of embryonic patterning. Drosophila uses long germ embryogenesis, where the embryo derives from the entire anterior - posterior axis, and all segments are patterned at the blastoderm stage, before gastrulation. In contrast, Tribolium undergoes short germ embryogenesis: the embryo arises from cells in the posterior of the egg, and only anterior segments are patterned at the blastoderm stage, with the remaining segments arising after gastrulation from a growth zone. Here we describe the role of otd in the long germband embryo of the wasp Nasonia vitripennis. We show that Nasonia otd maternal mRNA is localized at both poles of the embryo, and resulting protein gradients pattern both poles. Thus, localized Nasonia otd has two major roles that allow long germ development. It activates anterior targets at the anterior of the egg in a manner reminiscent of the Bcd gradient, and it is required for pre-gastrulation expression of posterior gap genes.","NYU Biol, Ctr Dev Genet, New York, NY 10003 USA; Western Washington Univ, Bellingham, WA 98225 USA","Desplan, C (reprint author), NYU Biol, Ctr Dev Genet, 100 Washington Sq E, New York, NY 10003 USA.",cd38@nyu.edu,,,,,,27,107,111,0,23,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,9-Feb,2006,439,7077,,,,,728,732,,10.1038/nature04445,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,010KH,WOS:000235193100045,16467838,No,,,11/20/17

To optimize the use of this limited capacity, attentional mechanisms give priority to behaviourally relevant stimuli at the expense of irrelevant distractors. In visual areas, attended stimuli induce enhanced responses and an improved synchronization of rhythmic neuronal activity in the gamma frequency band (40 - 70 Hz)(1-11). Both effects probably improve the neuronal signalling of attended stimuli within and among brain areas(1,12-16). Attention also results in improved behavioural performance and shortened reaction times. However, it is not known how reaction times are related to either response strength or gamma-band synchronization in visual areas. Here we show that behavioural response times to a stimulus change can be predicted specifically by the degree of gamma-band synchronization among those neurons in monkey visual area V4 that are activated by the behaviourally relevant stimulus. When there are two visual stimuli and monkeys have to detect a change in one stimulus while ignoring the other, their reactions are fastest when the relevant stimulus induces strong gamma-band synchronization before and after the change in stimulus. This enhanced gamma-band synchronization is also followed by shorter neuronal response latencies on the fast trials. Conversely, the monkeys' reactions are slowest when gamma-band synchronization is high in response to the irrelevant distractor. Thus, enhanced neuronal gamma-band synchronization and shortened neuronal response latencies to an attended stimulus seem to have direct effects on visually triggered behaviour, reflecting an early neuronal correlate of efficient visuo-motor integration.","Radboud Univ, FC Donders Ctr Cognit Neuroimaging, NL-6525 EN Nijmegen, Netherlands; Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Dept Biophys, NL-6525 EZ Nijmegen, Netherlands; Cold Spring Harbor Lab, Cold Spring Harbor, NY 11724 USA; NIMH, Neuropsychol Lab, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; MIT, McGovern Inst Brain Res, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA","Womelsdorf, T (reprint author), Radboud Univ, FC Donders Ctr Cognit Neuroimaging, NL-6525 EN Nijmegen, Netherlands.",t.womelsdorf@fcdonders.ru.nl,"Fries, Pascal/E-3196-2010","Fries, Pascal/0000-0002-4270-1468; Desimone, Robert/0000-0002-5938-4227; Womelsdorf, Thilo/0000-0001-6921-4187",Intramural NIH HHS,,,27,422,428,5,40,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,9-Feb,2006,439,7077,,,,,733,736,,10.1038/nature04258,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,010KH,WOS:000235193100046,16372022,No,,,11/20/17

Before fertilization and to overcome various barriers, their motility must be hyperactivated, a motion that is characterized by vigorous asymmetric tail beating(1). Hyperactivation requires an increase in calcium in the flagella, a process that probably involves plasmalemmal ion channels(2-8). Numerous attempts in the past two decades to understand sperm cell channels have been frustrated by the difficulty of measuring spermatozoan transmembrane ion currents(2,3,9 - 16). Here, by using a simple approach to patch-clamp spermatozoa and to characterize whole-spermatozoan currents, we describe a constitutively active flagellar calcium channel that is strongly potentiated by intracellular alkalinization. This current is not present in spermatozoa lacking the sperm-specific putative ion channel protein, CatSper1. This plasma membrane protein of the six transmembrane-spanning ion channel superfamily is specifically localized to the principal piece of the sperm tail and is required for sperm cell hyperactivation and male fertility(4,5). Our results identify CatSper1 as a component of the key flagellar calcium channel, and suggest that intracellular alkalinization potentiates CatSper current to increase intraflagellar calcium and induce sperm hyperactivation.","Harvard Univ, Childrens Hosp, Sch Med, Howard Hughes Med Inst,Dept Cardiol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; Harvard Univ, Childrens Hosp, Sch Med, Dept Neurobiol, Boston, MA 02115 USA","Clapham, DE (reprint author), Harvard Univ, Childrens Hosp, Sch Med, Howard Hughes Med Inst,Dept Cardiol, Enders 1309,320 Longwood Ave, Boston, MA 02115 USA.",dclapham@enders.tch.harvard.edu,,,,,,28,194,212,2,25,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,9-Feb,2006,439,7077,,,,,737,740,,10.1038/nature04417,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,010KH,WOS:000235193100047,16467839,No,,,11/20/17

These cysteine-rich modules recognize diverse host cell-surface receptors during pathogenesis. DBLs of parasite erythrocyte-binding proteins mediate invasion, and those from the antigenically variant P. falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein 1 ( PfEMP1) have been implicated in cytoadherence. The simian and human malarial parasites, P. knowlesi and P. vivax, invade human erythrocytes exclusively through the host DARC receptor ( Duffy antigen receptor for chemokines)(2,3). Here we present the crystal structure of the P. knowlesi DBL domain (Pk alpha-DBL), which binds to DARC during invasion of human erythrocytes. Pk alpha-DBL retains the overall fold observed in DBLs from P. falciparum erythrocyte-binding antigen (EBA)- 175 (ref. 4). Mapping the residues that have previously been implicated in binding(5-7) highlights a fairly flat but exposed site for DARC recognition in subdomain 2 of Pk alpha-DBL; this is in sharp contrast to receptor recognition by EBA- 175 ( ref. 4). In Pk alpha-DBL, the residues that contact DARC and the clusters of residues under immune pressure map to opposite surfaces of the DBL, and suggest a possible mechanism for immune evasion by P. vivax. Our comparative structural analysis of Pk alpha-DBL and P. falciparum EBA- 175 provides a framework for the understanding of malaria parasite DBLs, and may affect the development of new prophylactic and therapeutic strategies.","ICGEB, Struct & Computat Biol Grp, New Delhi 110067, India; ICGEB, Malaria Res Grp, New Delhi 110067, India; European Mol Biol Lab, F-38042 Grenoble 9, France","Sharma, A (reprint author), ICGEB, Struct & Computat Biol Grp, Aruna Asaf Marg, New Delhi 110067, India.",asharma@icgeb.res.in,,,,,,31,161,166,0,8,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,9-Feb,2006,439,7077,,,,,741,744,,10.1038/nature04443,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,010KH,WOS:000235193100048,16372020,No,,,11/20/17

For this reason several countries are now stockpiling ( vaccinia virus-based) smallpox vaccine. Although the preventive use of smallpox vaccination has been well documented, little is known about its efficacy when used after exposure to the virus. Here we compare the effectiveness of ( 1) post-exposure smallpox vaccination and ( 2) antiviral treatment with either cidofovir ( also called HPMPC or Vistide) or with a related acyclic nucleoside phosphonate analogue (HPMPO-DAPy) after lethal intratracheal infection of cynomolgus monkeys ( Macaca fascicularis) with monkeypox virus (MPXV). MPXV causes a disease similar to human smallpox(1) and this animal model can be used to measure differences in the protective efficacies of classical and new-generation candidate smallpox vaccines(2). We show that initiation of antiviral treatment 24 h after lethal intratracheal MPXV infection, using either of the antiviral agents and applying various systemic treatment regimens, resulted in significantly reduced mortality and reduced numbers of cutaneous monkeypox lesions. In contrast, when monkeys were vaccinated 24 h after MPXV infection, using a standard human dose of a currently recommended smallpox vaccine (Elstree-RIVM), no significant reduction in mortality was observed. When antiviral therapy was terminated 13 days after infection, all surviving animals had virus-specific serum antibodies and antiviral T lymphocytes. These data show that adequate preparedness for a biological threat involving smallpox should include the possibility of treating exposed individuals with antiviral compounds such as cidofovir or other selective anti-poxvirus drugs.","Erasmus MC, Dept Virol, NL-3000 DR Rotterdam, Netherlands; Erasmus MC, Dept Epidemiol & Biostat, NL-3000 DR Rotterdam, Netherlands; Katholieke Univ Leuven, Rega Inst Med Res, B-3000 Louvain, Belgium; Netherlands Vaccine Inst, NL-3720 BA Bilthoven, Netherlands; ViroClin BV, NL-3000 DR Rotterdam, Netherlands; Acad Sci Czech Republ, Inst Organ Chem & Biochem, CR-16610 Prague 6, Czech Republic","Osterhaus, ADME (reprint author), Erasmus MC, Dept Virol, NL-3000 DR Rotterdam, Netherlands.",a.osterhaus@erasmusmc.nl,"Van der Zeijst, Bernard/A-3847-2013","Van der Zeijst, Bernard/0000-0001-9316-2161; Osterhaus, Albert/0000-0002-6074-1172; Niesters, Hubert/0000-0002-1758-0430",,,,30,99,100,2,13,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,9-Feb,2006,439,7077,,,,,745,748,,10.1038/nature04295,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,010KH,WOS:000235193100049,16341204,No,,,11/20/17

Despite possessing multiple sets of related chromosomes, hexaploid ( bread) and tetraploid ( pasta) wheat both behave as diploids at meiosis. Correct pairing of homologous chromosomes is controlled by the Ph1 locus(1). In wheat hybrids, Ph1 prevents pairing between related chromosomes(2). Lack of Ph1 activity in diploid relatives of wheat suggests that Ph1 arose on polyploidization(3). Absence of phenotypic variation, apart from dosage effects, and the failure of ethylmethane sulphonate treatment to yield mutants, indicates that Ph1 has a complex structure(4,5). Here we have localized Ph1 to a 2.5-megabase interstitial region of wheat chromosome 5B containing a structure consisting of a segment of subtelomeric heterochromatin that inserted into a cluster of cdc2-related genes after polyploidization. The correlation of the presence of this structure with Ph1 activity in related species, and the involvement of heterochromatin with Ph1 (ref. 6) and cdc2 genes with meiosis, makes the structure a good candidate for the Ph1 locus.","Augustana Coll, Sioux Falls, SD 57197 USA; John Innes Ctr Plant Sci Res, Norwich NR4 7UH, Norfolk, England","Moore, G (reprint author), John Innes Ctr Plant Sci Res, Norwich NR4 7UH, Norfolk, England.",graham.moore@bbsrc.ac.uk,,"Colas, Isabelle/0000-0001-6980-9906",,,,29,241,267,0,55,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,9-Feb,2006,439,7077,,,,,749,752,,10.1038/nature04434,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,010KH,WOS:000235193100050,16467840,No,,,11/20/17

Eukaryotes and prokaryotes use N-terminal destabilizing residues as a signal to target proteins for degradation by the N-end rule pathway. In eukaryotes an E3 ligase, N-recognin, recognizes N-end rule substrates and mediates their ubiquitination and degradation by the proteasome(1,2). In Escherichia coli, N-end rule substrates are degraded by the AAA+ chaperone ClpA in complex with the ClpP peptidase (ClpAP)(3). Little is known of the molecular mechanism by which N-end rule substrates are initially selected for proteolysis. Here we report that the ClpAP-specific adaptor, ClpS, is essential for degradation of N-end rule substrates by ClpAP in bacteria. ClpS binds directly to N-terminal destabilizing residues through its substrate-binding site distal to the ClpS - ClpA interface(4), and targets these substrates to ClpAP for degradation. Degradation by the N-end rule pathway is more complex than anticipated and several other features are involved, including a net positive charge near the Nterminus and an unstructured region between the N-terminal signal and the folded protein substrate. Through interaction with this signal, ClpS converts the ClpAP machine into a protease with exquisitely defined specificity, ideally suited to regulatory proteolysis.","Univ Heidelberg, Zentrum Mol Biol Heidelberg, D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany; Humboldt Univ, Univ Klinikum Charite, D-10098 Berlin, Germany; La Trobe Univ, Dept Biochem, Melbourne, Vic 3086, Australia","Bukau, B (reprint author), Univ Heidelberg, Zentrum Mol Biol Heidelberg, INF 282, D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany.",bukau@zmbh.uni-heidelberg.de,"Dougan, David/B-3359-2010","Dougan, David/0000-0001-9313-1904",,,,19,124,127,0,12,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,9-Feb,2006,439,7077,,,,,753,756,,10.1038/nature04412,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,010KH,WOS:000235193100051,16467841,No,,,11/20/17

Several pathways exist in Escherichia coli to reactivate a blocked replication fork. The process of recombination-dependent restart of broken forks is well understood, but the consequence of replication through strand-specific lesions is less well known. Here we show that replication can be restarted and leading-strand synthesis re-initiated downstream of an unrepaired block to leading-strand progression, even when the 3'-OH of the nascent leading strand is unavailable. We demonstrate that the loading by a replication restart system of a single hexamer of the replication fork helicase, DnaB, on the lagging-strand template is sufficient to coordinate priming by the DnaG primase of both the leading and lagging strands. These observations provide a mechanism for damage bypass during fork reactivation, demonstrate how daughter-strand gaps are generated opposite leading-strand lesions during the replication of ultraviolet-light-irradiated DNA, and help to explain the remarkable speed at which even a heavily damaged DNA template is replicated.","Cornell Univ, Weill Grad Sch Med Sci, Program Mol Biol, New York, NY 10021 USA; Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, New York, NY 10021 USA","Marians, KJ (reprint author), Cornell Univ, Weill Grad Sch Med Sci, Program Mol Biol, New York, NY 10021 USA.",kmarians@sloankettering.edu,,,NIGMS NIH HHS [R37 GM034557],,,34,207,209,1,11,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,2-Feb,2006,439,7076,,,,,557,562,,10.1038/nature04329,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,008IO,WOS:000235033900033,16452972,No,,,11/20/17

Its high eccentricity and inclination to the ecliptic plane, along with its perihelion near the orbit of Neptune, identify it as a member of the 'scattered disk'. This disk of bodies probably originates in the Kuiper belt objects, which orbit near the ecliptic plane in circular orbits between 30 and 50 AU, and may include Pluto as a member. The optical brightness of 2003 UB313, if adjusted to Pluto's distance, is greater than that of Pluto, which suggested that it might be larger than Pluto(2). The actual size, however, could not be determined from the optical measurements because the surface reflectivity ( albedo) was unknown. Here we report observations of the thermal emission of 2003 UB313 at a wavelength of 1.2 mm, which in combination with the measured optical brightness leads to a diameter of 3,000 +/- 300 +/- 100 km. Here the first error reflects measurement uncertainties, while the second derives from the unknown object orientation. This makes 2003 UB313 the largest known trans-neptunian object, even larger than Pluto ( 2,300 km)(3). The albedo is 0.60 +/- 0.10 +/- 0.05, which is strikingly similar to that of Pluto, suggesting that the methane seen in the optical spectrum(2) causes a highly reflective icy surface.","Univ Bonn, Argelander Inst Astron, D-53121 Bonn, Germany; Max Planck Inst Radioastron, D-53121 Bonn, Germany; Inst Radio Astron Millimetr, F-38406 St Martin Dheres, France","Bertoldi, F (reprint author), Univ Bonn, Argelander Inst Astron, Hugel 71, D-53121 Bonn, Germany.",bertoldi@astro.uni-bonn.de,,,,,,13,34,34,0,2,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,2-Feb,2006,439,7076,,,,,563,564,,10.1038/nature04494,,2,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,008IO,WOS:000235033900034,16452973,No,,,11/20/17

Thus, in searching for electrochemically active materials for fuel cell anodes, high defect concentration is generally avoided. Here we describe an oxide anode formed from lanthanum-substituted strontium titanate (La-SrTiO3) in which we control the oxygen stoichiometry in order to break down the extended defect intergrowth regions and create phases with considerable disordered oxygen defects. We substitute Ti in these phases with Ga and Mn to induce redox activity and allow more flexible coordination. The material demonstrates impressive fuel cell performance using wet hydrogen at 950 degrees C. It is also important for fuel cell technology to achieve efficient electrode operation with different hydrocarbon fuels(3,4), although such fuels are more demanding than pure hydrogen. The best anode materials to date-Ni-YSZ ( yttria-stabilized zirconia) cermets(5) - suffer some disadvantages related to low tolerance to sulphur(6), carbon build-up when using hydrocarbon fuels(7) ( though device modifications and lower temperature operation can avoid this(8,9)) and volume instability on redox cycling.

Yet the vast majority of industrial heterogeneous catalysis occurs at ambient or elevated pressures using complex materials with crystal faces, edges and defects differing in their catalytic activity. Clearly, if new or improved catalysts are to be rationally designed, we require quantitative correlations between surface features and catalytic activity - ideally obtained under realistic reaction conditions(1-3). Transmission electron microscopy(4-6) and scanning tunnelling microscopy(7,8) have allowed in situ characterization of catalyst surfaces with atomic resolution, but are limited by the need for low-pressure conditions and conductive surfaces, respectively. Sum frequency generation spectroscopy can identify vibrations of adsorbed reactants and products in both gaseous and condensed phases(9), but so far lacks sensitivity down to the single molecule level. Here we adapt real-time monitoring of the chemical transformation of individual organic molecules by fluorescence microscopy(10-12) to monitor reactions catalysed by crystals of a layered double hydroxide immersed in reagent solution. By using a wide field microscope, we are able to map the spatial distribution of catalytic activity over the entire crystal by counting single turnover events. We find that ester hydrolysis proceeds on the lateral {10 (1) over bar0} crystal faces, while transesterification occurs on the entire outer crystal surface. Because the method operates at ambient temperature and pressure and in a condensed phase, it can be applied to the growing number of liquid-phase industrial organic transformations to localize catalytic activity on and in inorganic solids. An exciting opportunity is the use of probe molecules with different size and functionality, which should provide insight into shape-selective or structure-sensitive catalysis(13-15) and thus help with the rational design of new or more productive heterogeneous catalysts.","Katholieke Univ Leuven, Microbial Syst, B-3001 Louvain, Belgium; Katholieke Univ Leuven, Mol Syst, B-3001 Louvain, Belgium; Katholieke Univ Leuven, Div Mol & Nano Mat, B-3001 Louvain, Belgium","De Vos, DE (reprint author), Katholieke Univ Leuven, Microbial Syst, Kasteelpk Arenberg 23, B-3001 Louvain, Belgium.",dirk.devos@biw.kuleuven.be; johan.hofkens@chem.kuleuven.be,"Roeffaers, Maarten/D-9328-2011","Roeffaers, Maarten/0000-0001-6582-6514; Hofkens, Johan/0000-0002-9101-0567",,,,30,265,269,12,173,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,2-Feb,2006,439,7076,,,,,572,575,,10.1038/nature04502,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,008IO,WOS:000235033900037,16452976,No,,,11/20/17

Hence, skilful seasonal climate forecasts may provide early warning of changes of risk in epidemic-prone regions. Here we discuss the development of a system to forecast probabilities of anomalously high and low malaria incidence with dynamically based, seasonal-timescale, multi-model ensemble predictions of climate, using leading global coupled ocean - atmosphere climate models developed in Europe. This forecast system is successfully applied to the prediction of malaria risk in Botswana, where links between malaria and climate variability are well established(4), adding up to four months lead time over malaria warnings issued with observed precipitation and having a comparably high level of probabilistic prediction skill.

For example, the striking global peaks in juvenile igneous activity 2.7, 1.9 and 1.2 Gyr ago imply rapid crustal generation in response to the emplacement of mantle 'super-plumes', rather than by the continuous process of subduction(2-4). Yet uncertainties persist over whether these age peaks are artefacts of selective preservation(5), and over how to reconcile episodic crust formation with the smooth crustal evolution curves inferred from neodymium isotope variations of sedimentary rocks(6,7). Detrital zircons encapsulate a more representative record of igneous events than the exposed geology(1,8,9) and their hafnium isotope ratios reflect the time since the source of the parental magmas separated from the mantle. These 'model' ages are only meaningful if the host magma lacked a mixed or sedimentary source component(10), but the latter can be diagnosed by oxygen isotopes, which are strongly fractionated by rock-hydrosphere interactions. Here we report the first study that integrates hafnium and oxygen isotopes, all measured in situ on the same, precisely dated detrital zircon grains. The data reveal that crust generation in part of Gondwana was limited to major pulses at 1.9 and 3.3 Gyr ago, and that the zircons crystallized during repeated reworking of crust formed at these times. The implication is that the mechanisms of crust formation differed from those of crustal differentiation in ancient orogenic belts.","Univ Bristol, Dept Earth Sci, Bristol BS8 1RJ, Avon, England; Curtin Univ Technol, Dept Appl Geol, Tecton Special Res Ctr, Perth, WA 6845, Australia","Kemp, AIS (reprint author), Univ Bristol, Dept Earth Sci, Wills Mem Bldg, Bristol BS8 1RJ, Avon, England.",tony.kemp@geo.sc.niigata-u.ac.jp,"Kemp, Anthony/H-5179-2014",,,,,32,361,376,6,97,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,2-Feb,2006,439,7076,,,,,580,583,,10.1038/nature04505,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,008IO,WOS:000235033900039,16452978,No,,,11/20/17

Toxinological analyses of venom components from the Lace Monitor Varanus varius showed potent effects on blood pressure and clotting ability, bioactivities associated with a rapid loss of consciousness and extensive bleeding in prey. The iguanian lizard Pogona barbata retains characteristics of the ancestral venom system, namely serial, lobular non-compound venom-secreting glands on both the upper and lower jaws, whereas the advanced snakes and anguimorph lizards ( including Monitor Lizards, Gila Monster and Beaded Lizard) have more derived venom systems characterized by the loss of the mandibular ( lower) or maxillary ( upper) glands. Demonstration that the snakes, iguanians and anguimorphs form a single clade provides overwhelming support for a single, early origin of the venom system in lizards and snakes. These results provide new insights into the evolution of the venom system in squamate reptiles and open new avenues for biomedical research and drug design using hitherto unexplored venom proteins.","Univ Melbourne, Sch Med, Australian Venom Res Unit, Parkville, Vic 3010, Australia; Museum Victoria, Polulat & Evolutionary Genet Unit, Melbourne, Vic 3001, Australia; Penn State Univ, Dept Biol, Mueller Lab 208, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; Penn State Univ, Astrobiol Res Ctr, Mueller Lab 208, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; Museum Natl Hist Nat, Dept Systemat & Evolut, UMS 602, F-75005 Paris, France; Leiden Univ, Inst Biol, NL-2300 RA Leiden, Netherlands; Ctr Med Univ Geneva, Swiss Inst Bioinformat, CH-1211 Geneva 4, Switzerland; Univ Geneva, Dept Struct Biol & Bioinformat, CH-1211 Geneva 4, Switzerland; SBC Lab AG, CH-8185 Winkel, Switzerland; Monash Univ, Dept Pharmacol, Monash Venom Grp, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia; CSIRO, Mol & Hlth Technol, Parkville, Vic 3010, Australia; Univ Melbourne, Dept Pathol, Parkville, Vic 3010, Australia; Royal Childrens Hosp, Murdoch Childrens Res Inst, Parkville, Vic 3052, Australia; Tel Aviv Univ, Dept Zool, IL-69978 Tel Aviv, Israel","Fry, BG (reprint author), Univ Melbourne, Sch Med, Australian Venom Res Unit, Level 8, Parkville, Vic 3010, Australia.",bgf@unimelb.edu.au,"Richardson, Michael/E-8269-2011; Fung, Kim/H-3522-2013; Kuruppu, Sanjaya/I-2258-2014; Ignjatovic, Vera/F-8598-2011","Richardson, Michael/0000-0003-1222-8101; Fung, Kim/0000-0002-7205-4206; Kuruppu, Sanjaya/0000-0003-1674-3645; ",,,,30,286,324,15,252,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,2-Feb,2006,439,7076,,,,,584,588,,10.1038/nature04328,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,008IO,WOS:000235033900040,16292255,No,,,11/20/17

Accumulating evidence suggests that neuronal activity regulates adult neurogenesis and that new neurons contribute to specific brain functions(1-8). The mechanism that regulates the integration of newly generated neurons into the pre-existing functional circuitry in the adult brain is unknown. Here we show that newborn granule cells in the dentate gyrus of the adult hippocampus are tonically activated by ambient GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid) before being sequentially innervated by GABA- and glutamate-mediated synaptic inputs. GABA, the major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the adult brain, initially exerts an excitatory action on newborn neurons owing to their high cytoplasmic chloride ion content(9-12). Conversion of GABA- induced depolarization ( excitation) into hyperpolarization ( inhibition) in newborn neurons leads to marked defects in their synapse formation and dendritic development in vivo. Our study identifies an essential role for GABA in the synaptic integration of newly generated neurons in the adult brain, and suggests an unexpected mechanism for activity-dependent regulation of adult neurogenesis, in which newborn neurons may sense neuronal network activity through tonic and phasic GABA activation.","Johns Hopkins Univ, Sch Med, Dept Neurol, Inst Cell Engn, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA; Johns Hopkins Univ, Sch Med, Dept Neurosci, Inst Cell Engn, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA","Song, HJ (reprint author), Johns Hopkins Univ, Sch Med, Dept Neurol, Inst Cell Engn, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA.",gming1@bs.jhmi.edu; shongju1@bs.jhmi.edu,"Goh, Eyleen/A-8006-2013; Ming, Guo-li/J-7880-2013","Sailor, Kurt/0000-0002-9574-6838",NEI NIH HHS [T32 EY017203]; NIA NIH HHS [R01 AG024984]; NINDS NIH HHS [R01 NS047344],,,30,714,759,4,58,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,2-Feb,2006,439,7076,,,,,589,593,,10.1038/nature04404,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,008IO,WOS:000235033900041,16341203,No,,,11/20/17

Drosophila neuroblasts undergo self-renewal with every cell division, producing another neuroblast and a differentiating daughter cell, but the mechanisms controlling the self-renewal/differentiation decision are poorly understood. Here we tested whether cell polarity genes, known to regulate embryonic neuroblast asymmetric cell division(1), also regulate neuroblast self-renewal. Clonal analysis in larval brains showed that pins mutant neuroblasts rapidly fail to self-renew, whereas lethal giant larvae (lgl) mutant neuroblasts generate multiple neuroblasts. Notably, lgl pins double mutant neuroblasts all divide symmetrically to self-renew, filling the brain with neuroblasts at the expense of neurons. The lgl pins neuroblasts show ectopic cortical localization of atypical protein kinase C ( aPKC), and a decrease in aPKC expression reduces neuroblast numbers, suggesting that aPKC promotes neuroblast self-renewal. In support of this hypothesis, neuroblast-specific overexpression of membrane-targeted aPKC, but not a kinase-dead version, induces ectopic neuroblast self-renewal. We conclude that cortical aPKC kinase activity is a potent inducer of neuroblast self-renewal.","Univ Oregon, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Inst Neurosci, Eugene, OR 97403 USA; Univ Oregon, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Inst Mol Biol, Eugene, OR 97403 USA","Doe, CQ (reprint author), Univ Oregon, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Inst Neurosci, Eugene, OR 97403 USA.",cdoe@uoregon.edu,,,,,,27,206,215,1,4,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,2-Feb,2006,439,7076,,,,,594,598,,10.1038/nature04299,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,008IO,WOS:000235033900042,16357871,No,,,11/20/17

Unique features of bone that contribute to a microenvironmental niche for stem cells might include the known high concentration of calcium ions at the HSC-enriched endosteal surface. Cells respond to extracellular ionic calcium concentrations through the seven-transmembrane-spanning calcium-sensing receptor (CaR), which we identified as being expressed on HSCs. Here we show that, through the CaR, the simple ionic mineral content of the niche may dictate the preferential localization of adult mammalian haematopoiesis in bone. Antenatal mice deficient in CaR had primitive haematopoietic cells in the circulation and spleen, whereas few were found in bone marrow. CaR-/- HSCs from fetal liver were normal in number, in proliferative and differentiative function, and in migration and homing to the bone marrow. Yet they were highly defective in localizing anatomically to the endosteal niche, behaviour that correlated with defective adhesion to the extracellular matrix protein, collagen I.

We then classified the genes on the basis of the effect of their depletion on organization of the Golgi membranes.

However, in theoretical analysis, we showed that noise frequency content is determined by the underlying gene circuits, leading to a mapping between gene circuit structure and the noise frequency range(11,12). An intriguing prediction from our previous studies was that negative autoregulation shifts noise to higher frequencies where it is more easily filtered out by gene networks(11) - a property that may contribute to the prevalence of autoregulation motifs ( for example, found in the regulation of similar to 40% of Escherichia coli genes). Here we measure noise frequency content in growing cultures of E. coli, and verify the link between gene circuit structure and noise spectra by demonstrating the negative autoregulation-mediated spectral shift. We further demonstrate that noise spectral measurements provide mechanistic insights into gene regulation, as perturbations of gene circuit parameters are discernible in the measured noise frequency ranges. These results suggest that noise spectral measurements could facilitate the discovery of novel regulatory relationships.","Oak Ridge Natl Lab, Mol Scale Engn & Nanoscale Technol Grp, Oak Ridge, TN 37831 USA; Oak Ridge Natl Lab, Div Math & Comp Sci, Oak Ridge, TN 37831 USA; Univ Tennessee, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA","Simpson, ML (reprint author), Oak Ridge Natl Lab, Mol Scale Engn & Nanoscale Technol Grp, Bethel Valley Rd, Oak Ridge, TN 37831 USA.",simpsonML1@ornl.gov,"Simpson, Michael/A-8410-2011; Cox, Chris/A-9451-2013","Simpson, Michael/0000-0002-3933-3457; Cox, Chris/0000-0001-9818-5477",,,,25,170,173,3,22,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,2-Feb,2006,439,7076,,,,,608,611,,10.1038/nature04194,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,008IO,WOS:000235033900045,16452980,No,,,11/20/17

This structure displays not only the icosahedral shell of 60 hexamers and 11 pentamers, but also the non-icosahedral components at one pentameric vertex. The densities at this vertex can be identified as the 12-subunit portal complex sandwiched between an internal cylindrical core and an external tail hub connecting to six projecting trimeric tailspikes. The viral genome is packed as coaxial coils in at least three outer layers with similar to 90 terminal nucleotides extending through the protein core and the portal complex and poised for injection.

However, some replication systems have evolved to use cellular DNA-dependent RNA polymerase for primer synthesis(1,2). The main requirement for the replication primer, an exposed RNA 3' end annealed to the DNA template, is not compatible with known conformations of the transcription elongation complex(3), raising a question of how the priming is achieved. Here we show that a previously unrecognized kind of transcription complex is formed during RNA polymerase-catalysed synthesis of the M13 bacteriophage replication primer. The complex contains an overextended RNA - DNA hybrid bound in the RNA-polymerase trough that is normally occupied by downstream double-stranded DNA, thus leaving the 3' end of the RNA available for interaction with DNA polymerase. Transcription complexes with similar topology may prime the replication of other bacterial mobile elements and may regulate transcription elongation under conditions that favour the formation of an extended RNA - DNA hybrid.","Rutgers State Univ, Waksman Inst, Piscataway, NJ 08854 USA; Rutgers State Univ, Dept Mol Biol & Biochem, Piscataway, NJ 08854 USA; Russian Acad Sci, Inst Mol Genet, Moscow 123182, Russia","Zenkin, N (reprint author), Rutgers State Univ, Waksman Inst, Piscataway, NJ 08854 USA.",nicserzen@mail.ru; severik@waksman.rutgers.edu,"Severinov, Konstantin/C-8545-2016","Zenkin, Nikolay/0000-0003-2212-9545",,,,15,28,28,0,8,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,2-Feb,2006,439,7076,,,,,617,620,,10.1038/nature04337,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,008IO,WOS:000235033900047,16452982,No,,,11/20/17

This synchronization requires a precisely timed series of enzymatic steps that control the synthesis of an RNA primer, the recycling of the lagging-strand DNA polymerase, and the production of an Okazaki fragment. Primases synthesize RNA primers at a rate that is orders of magnitude lower(2-4) than the rate of DNA synthesis by the DNA polymerases at the fork. Furthermore, the recycling of the lagging-strand DNA polymerase from a finished Okazaki fragment to a new primer is inherently slower than the rate of nucleotide polymerization(5). Different models have been put forward to explain how these slow enzymatic steps can take place at the lagging strand without losing coordination with the continuous and fast leading-strand synthesis(6-8). Nonetheless, a clear picture remains elusive. Here we use single-molecule techniques to study the kinetics of a multiprotein replication complex from bacteriophage T7 and to characterize the effect of primase activity on fork progression. We observe the synthesis of primers on the lagging strand to cause transient pausing of the highly processive leading-strand synthesis. In the presence of both leading- and lagging-strand synthesis, we observe the formation and release of a replication loop on the lagging strand. Before loop formation, the primase acts as a molecular brake and transiently halts progression of the replication fork. This observation suggests a mechanism that prevents leading- strand synthesis from outpacing lagging-strand synthesis during the slow enzymatic steps on the lagging strand.","Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Biol Chem & Mol Pharmacol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Grad Program Biol & Biomed Sci, Boston, MA 02115 USA; Harvard Univ, Dept Chem & Biol Chem, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA","van Oijen, AM (reprint author), Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Biol Chem & Mol Pharmacol, 250 Longwood Ave, Boston, MA 02115 USA.",antoine_van_oijen@hms.harvard.edu,,"van Oijen, Antoine/0000-0002-1794-5161; Hamdan, Samir/0000-0001-5192-1852",,,,30,168,174,2,32,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,2-Feb,2006,439,7076,,,,,621,624,,10.1038/nature04317,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,008IO,WOS:000235033900048,16452983,No,,,11/20/17

We focus on the behavioural process of construction within a single generation, identifying the role a robustness mechanism(2) - conflict management - has in promoting interactions that build social resource networks or social niches. Using 'knockout' experiments on a large, captive group of pigtailed macaques ( Macaca nemestrina), we show that a policing function, performed infrequently by a small subset of individuals(3), significantly contributes to maintaining stable resource networks in the face of chronic perturbations that arise through conflict. When policing is absent, social niches destabilize, with group members building smaller, less diverse, and less integrated grooming, play, proximity and contact-sitting networks. Instability is quantified in terms of reduced mean degree, increased clustering, reduced reach, and increased assortativity. Policing not only controls conflict(3-5), we find it significantly influences the structure of networks that constitute essential social resources in gregarious primate societies. The structure of such networks plays a critical role in infant survivorship(6), emergence and spread of cooperative behaviour(7), social learning and cultural traditions(8).","Santa Fe Inst, Santa Fe, NM 87501 USA; Emory Univ, Yerkes Natl Primate Res Ctr, Living Links Ctr, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA; Emory Univ, Neurosci & Anim Behav Program, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA","Flack, JC (reprint author), Santa Fe Inst, Santa Fe, NM 87501 USA.",jflack@santafe.edu,,,,,,29,274,287,9,134,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,26-Jan,2006,439,7075,,,,,426,429,,10.1038/nature04326,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,005XH,WOS:000234859200036,16437106,No,,,11/20/17

Inactivation of tumour-suppressor genes by epigenetic changes is frequently observed in human cancers, particularly as a result of the modifications of histones and DNA methylation. It is therefore important to understand how these damaging changes might come about. By studying tumorigenesis in the Drosophila eye, here we identify two Polycomb group epigenetic silencers, Pipsqueak and Lola, that participate in this process. When coupled with overexpression of Delta, deregulation of the expression of Pipsqueak and Lola induces the formation of metastatic tumours. This phenotype depends on the histone-modifying enzymes Rpd3 ( a histone deacetylase), Su(var)3-9 and E(z), as well as on the chromodomain protein Polycomb. Expression of the gene Retinoblastoma-family protein (Rbf) is downregulated in these tumours and, indeed, this downregulation is associated with DNA hypermethylation. Together, these results establish a mechanism that links the Notch - Delta pathway, epigenetic silencing pathways and cell-cycle control in the process of tumorigenesis.","CSIC, UMH, Inst Neurosci, Alicante, Spain; Univ Cadiz, Fac Ciencias, Dept Bioquim & Biol Mol, Puerto Real 11510, Spain","Dominguez, M (reprint author), CSIC, UMH, Inst Neurosci, Campus San Juan,Apartado 18, Alicante, Spain.",m.dominguez@umh.es,"Dominguez, Maria/G-2171-2014; Ferres-Marco, Maria /G-8364-2015; BOLIVAR, JORGE/G-4322-2015","Dominguez, Maria/0000-0002-3329-7862; Ferres-Marco, Maria /0000-0002-0596-4891; BOLIVAR, JORGE/0000-0002-2645-9528",,,,50,133,137,2,14,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,26-Jan,2006,439,7075,,,,,430,436,,10.1038/nature04376,,7,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,005XH,WOS:000234859200037,16437107,No,,,11/20/17

More than 170 extrasolar planets have been discovered with a wide range of masses and orbital periods, but planets of Neptune's mass or less have not hitherto been detected at separations of more than 0.15 AU from normal stars.

Ultrahigh-intensity lasers can produce accelerating fields of 10 TV m(-1) (1 TV = 10(12) V), surpassing those in conventional accelerators by six orders of magnitude. Laser-driven ions with energies of several MeV per nucleon have also been produced(5-9). Such ion beams exhibit unprecedented characteristics - short pulse lengths, high currents and low transverse emittance(10) - but their exponential energy spectra have almost 100% energy spread. This large energy spread, which is a consequence of the experimental conditions used to date, remains the biggest impediment to the wider use of this technology. Here we report the production of quasi-monoenergetic laser-driven C5+ ions with a vastly reduced energy spread of 17%.

Crystallization is still an important means for separating chiral molecules into their two different mirror-image isomers (enantiomers)(2), yet remains poorly understood(3). For example, there are no firm rules to predict whether a particular pair of chiral partners will follow the behaviour of the vast majority of chiral molecules and crystallize together as racemic crystals(4), or as separate enantiomers. A somewhat simpler and more tractable version of this phenomenon is crystallization in two dimensions, such as the formation of surface structures by adsorbed molecules. The relatively simple spatial molecular arrangement of these systems makes it easier to study the effects of specific chiral interactions(5); moreover, chiral assembly and recognition processes can be observed directly and with molecular resolution using scanning tunnelling microscopy(6-9). The enantioseparation of chiral molecules in two dimensions is expected to occur more readily because planar confinement excludes some bulk crystal symmetry elements and enhances chiral interactions(10,11); however, many surface structures have been found to be racemic(12-18). Here we show that the chiral hydrocarbon heptahelicene on a Cu(111) surface does not undergo two-dimensional spontaneous resolution into enantiomers(19), but still shows enantiomorphism on a mesoscopic length scale that is readily amplified. That is, we observe formation of racemic heptahelicene domains with non-superimposable mirror-like lattice structures, with a small excess of one of the heptahelicene enantiomers suppressing the formation of one domain type. Similar to the induction of homochirality in achiral enantiomorphous monolayers(20) by a chiral modifier, a small enantiomeric excess suffices to ensure that the entire molecular monolayer consists of domains having only one of two possible, non-superimposable, mirror-like lattice structures.","Swiss Fed Labs Mat Testing & Res, Empa, CH-8600 Dubendorf, Switzerland","Ernst, KH (reprint author), Swiss Fed Labs Mat Testing & Res, Empa, Uberlandstr 129, CH-8600 Dubendorf, Switzerland.",karl-heinz.ernst@empa.ch,"Fasel, Roman/B-5396-2011; Ernst, Karl-Heinz/O-6128-2015","Fasel, Roman/0000-0002-1553-6487; Ernst, Karl-Heinz/0000-0002-2077-4922",,,,23,266,268,16,153,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,26-Jan,2006,439,7075,,,,,449,452,,10.1038/nature04419,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,005XH,WOS:000234859200041,16437111,No,,,11/20/17

The importance of cloud - radiation interactions is being investigated through advanced instrumentation deployed in the high Arctic since 1997 (refs 7, 8). These studies have established that clouds, via the dominance of longwave radiation, exert a net warming on the Arctic climate system throughout most of the year, except briefly during the summer(9). The Arctic region also experiences significant periodic influxes of anthropogenic aerosols, which originate from the industrial regions in lower latitudes(10). Here we use multisensor radiometric data(7,8) to show that enhanced aerosol concentrations alter the microphysical properties of Arctic clouds, in a process known as the 'first indirect' effect(11,12). Under frequently occurring cloud types we find that this leads to an increase of an average 3.4 watts per square metre in the surface longwave fluxes. This is comparable to a warming effect from established greenhouse gases and implies that the observed longwave enhancement is climatologically significant.","Univ Calif San Diego, Scripps Inst Oceanog, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; Brookhaven Natl Lab, Upton, NY 11973 USA","Lubin, D (reprint author), Univ Calif San Diego, Scripps Inst Oceanog, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.",dlubin@ucsd.edu,"Vogelmann, Andrew/M-8779-2014","Vogelmann, Andrew/0000-0003-1918-5423",,,,26,94,94,0,17,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,26-Jan,2006,439,7075,,,,,453,456,,10.1038/nature04449,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,005XH,WOS:000234859200042,16437112,No,,,11/20/17

Studies suggest that plant respiratory metabolism also scales as the 3/4-power of mass(12-14), and that higher plant and animal scaling follow similar rules owing to the predominance of fractal-like transport networks and associated allometric scaling(8-14). Here, however, using data obtained from about 500 laboratory and field-grown plants from 43 species and four experiments, we show that whole-plant respiration rate scales approximately isometrically ( scaling exponent approximate to 1) with total plant mass in individual experiments and has no common relation across all data. Moreover, consistent with theories about biochemically based physiological scaling(15-18), isometric scaling of whole-plant respiration rate to total nitrogen content is observed within and across all data sets, with a single relation common to all data. This isometric scaling is unaffected by growth conditions including variation in light, nitrogen availability, temperature and atmospheric CO2 concentration, and is similar within or among species or functional groups.

It can synchronize populations of interacting species, stabilize them, and diversify gene pools(1-3). Human travel, for example, is responsible for the geographical spread of human infectious disease(4-9). In the light of increasing international trade, intensified human mobility and the imminent threat of an influenza A epidemic(10), the knowledge of dynamical and statistical properties of human travel is of fundamental importance. Despite its crucial role, a quantitative assessment of these properties on geographical scales remains elusive, and the assumption that humans disperse diffusively still prevails in models. Here we report on a solid and quantitative assessment of human travelling statistics by analysing the circulation of bank notes in the United States. Using a comprehensive data set of over a million individual displacements, we find that dispersal is anomalous in two ways. First, the distribution of travelling distances decays as a power law, indicating that trajectories of bank notes are reminiscent of scale-free random walks known as Levy flights. Second, the probability of remaining in a small, spatially confined region for a time T is dominated by algebraically long tails that attenuate the superdiffusive spread. We show that human travelling behaviour can be described mathematically on many spatiotemporal scales by a two-parameter continuous-time random walk model to a surprising accuracy, and conclude that human travel on geographical scales is an ambivalent and effectively superdiffusive process.","Max Planck Inst Dynam & Self Org, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany; Univ Gottingen, Dept Phys, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany; Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Kavli Inst Theoret Phys, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; Bernstein Ctr Computat Neurosci, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany","Brockmann, D (reprint author), Max Planck Inst Dynam & Self Org, Bunsenstr 10, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany.",brockmann@ds.mpg.de,"Brockmann, Dirk/B-7342-2009; Brockmann, Dirk/A-1931-2014",,,,,23,845,876,23,149,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,26-Jan,2006,439,7075,,,,,462,465,,10.1038/nature04292,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,005XH,WOS:000234859200044,16437114,No,,,11/20/17

We engaged male and female volunteers in an economic game, in which two confederates played fairly or unfairly, and then measured brain activity with functional magnetic resonance imaging while these same volunteers observed the confederates receiving pain. Both sexes exhibited empathy-related activation in pain-related brain areas (fronto-insular and anterior cingulate cortices) towards fair players. However, these empathy-related responses were significantly reduced in males when observing an unfair person receiving pain. This effect was accompanied by increased activation in reward-related areas, correlated with an expressed desire for revenge. We conclude that in men ( at least) empathic responses are shaped by valuation of other people's social behaviour, such that they empathize with fair opponents while favouring the physical punishment of unfair opponents, a finding that echoes recent evidence for altruistic punishment.","UCL, Wellcome Dept Imaging Neurosci, London WC1N 3AR, England; UCL, Inst Cognit Neurosci, London WC1N 3AR, England; CALTECH, Div Humanities & Social Sci, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA","Singer, T (reprint author), UCL, Wellcome Dept Imaging Neurosci, London WC1N 3AR, England.",t.singer@fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk,"Frith, Chris/A-2171-2009; Girault, Johann/B-2430-2012; Frank, David/E-8213-2012; O'Doherty, John/F-1204-2013","Frith, Chris/0000-0002-8665-0690; Dolan, Ray/0000-0001-9356-761X; Seymour, Ben/0000-0003-1724-5832; Stephan, Klaas Enno/0000-0002-8594-9092","Wellcome Trust [, 078865]",,,29,735,763,14,207,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,26-Jan,2006,439,7075,,,,,466,469,,10.1038/nature04271,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,005XH,WOS:000234859200045,16421576,No,,,11/20/17

The Drosophila midgut is typical: enterocytes make up the majority of the intestinal epithelial monolayer, but are interspersed with hormone-producing enteroendocrine cells(2-4). Human ( and mouse) intestinal cells are continuously replenished by stem cells, the misregulation of which may underlie some common digestive diseases and cancer(5). In contrast, stem cells have not been described in the intestines of flies, and Drosophila intestinal cells have been thought to be relatively stable(6-7). Here we use lineage labelling to show that adult Drosophila posterior midgut cells are continuously replenished by a distinctive population of intestinal stem cells (ISCs). As in vertebrates, ISCs are multipotent, and Notch signalling is required to produce an appropriate fraction of enteroendocrine cells(8). Notch is also required for the differentiation of ISC daughter cells, a role that has not been addressed in vertebrates. Unlike previously characterized stem cells, which reside in niches containing a specific partner stromal cell(9,10), ISCs adjoin only the basement membrane, differentiated enterocytes and their most recent daughters. The identification of Drosophila intestinal stem cells with striking similarities to their vertebrate counterparts will facilitate the genetic analysis of normal and abnormal intestinal function.","Carnegie Inst Washington, Howard Hughes Med Inst Res Labs, Dept Embryol, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA","Spradling, A (reprint author), Carnegie Inst Washington, Howard Hughes Med Inst Res Labs, Dept Embryol, 3520 San Martin Dr, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA.",spradling@ciwemb.edu,,,Howard Hughes Medical Institute; Intramural NIH HHS [Z01 BC010738-01],,,29,464,482,4,40,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,26-Jan,2006,439,7075,,,,,470,474,,10.1038/nature04333,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,005XH,WOS:000234859200046,16340960,No,,,11/20/17

A fundamental property of stem and progenitor cell division is the capacity to retain a proliferative state or generate differentiated daughter cells(2); however, little is currently known about signals that regulate the balance between these processes. Here, we characterize a proliferating cellular compartment in the adult Drosophila midgut. Using genetic mosaic analysis we demonstrate that differentiated cells in the epithelium arise from a common lineage. Furthermore, we show that reduction of Notch signalling leads to an increase in the number of midgut progenitor cells, whereas activation of the Notch pathway leads to a decrease in proliferation. Thus, the midgut progenitor's default state is proliferation, which is inhibited through the Notch signalling pathway. The ability to identify, manipulate and genetically trace cell lineages in the midgut should lead to the discovery of additional genes that regulate stem and progenitor cell biology in the gastrointestinal tract.","Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Genet, Boston, MA 02115 USA; Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Boston, MA 02115 USA","Micchelli, CA (reprint author), Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Genet, 77 Ave Louis Pasteur, Boston, MA 02115 USA.",cmicchel@genetics.med.harvard.edu,,"Perrimon, Norbert/0000-0001-7542-472X",,,,19,453,469,0,34,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,26-Jan,2006,439,7075,,,,,475,479,,10.1038/nature04371,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,005XH,WOS:000234859200047,16340959,No,,,11/20/17

Epiboly is a process in which embryonic cells spread from the animal pole to cover the underlying yolk. During epiboly, cyp11a1 is expressed in an extra-embryonic yolk syncytial layer(4). Reducing cyp11a1 expression in zebrafish using antisense morpholino oligonucleotides did not perturb cell fates, but caused epibolic delay. This epibolic defect was partially rescued by the injection of cyp11a1 RNA or the supplementation of pregnenolone. We show that the epibolic delay is accompanied by a decrease in the level of polymerized microtubules, and that pregnenolone can rescue this microtubule defect.

BAs activate mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways(1,2), are ligands for the G-protein-coupled receptor ( GPCR) TGR5(3,4) and activate nuclear hormone receptors such as farnesoid X receptor alpha ( FXR-alpha; NR1H4)(5-7). FXR-alpha regulates the enterohepatic recycling and biosynthesis of BAs by controlling the expression of genes such as the short heterodimer partner (SHP; NR0B2)(8,9) that inhibits the activity of other nuclear receptors. The FXR-alpha-mediated SHP induction also underlies the downregulation of the hepatic fatty acid and triglyceride biosynthesis and very-low-density lipoprotein production mediated by sterol-regulatory-element-binding protein 1c(10). This indicates that BAs might be able to function beyond the control of BA homeostasis as general metabolic integrators. Here we show that the administration of BAs to mice increases energy expenditure in brown adipose tissue, preventing obesity and resistance to insulin. This novel metabolic effect of BAs is critically dependent on induction of the cyclic-AMP-dependent thyroid hormone activating enzyme type 2 iodothyronine deiodinase (D2) because it is lost in D2(-/-) mice. Treatment of brown adipocytes and human skeletal myocytes with BA increases D2 activity and oxygen consumption. These effects are independent of FXR-alpha, and instead are mediated by increased cAMP production that stems from the binding of BAs with the G-protein-coupled receptor TGR5. In both rodents and humans, the most thermogenically important tissues are specifically targeted by this mechanism because they coexpress D2 and TGR5. The BA - TGR5 - cAMP - D2 signalling pathway is therefore a crucial mechanism for fine-tuning energy homeostasis that can be targeted to improve metabolic control.","ULP, CNRS, INSERM, Inst Genet & Biol Mol & Cellulaire, F-67404 Illkirch Graffenstaden, France; Brigham & Womens Hosp, Dept Med, Thyroid Sect, Div Endocrinol Diabet & Hypertens, Boston, MA 02115 USA; Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Boston, MA 02115 USA; Natl Inst Hlth & Nutr, Div Clin Nutr, Shinjuku Ku, Tokyo 1628636, Japan; Univ Tokyo, RCAST, Lab Syst Biol & Med, Tokyo 1538904, Japan; Inst Clin Souris, F-67404 Illkirch Graffenstaden, France","Auwerx, J (reprint author), ULP, CNRS, INSERM, Inst Genet & Biol Mol & Cellulaire, 1 Rue Laurent Fries, F-67404 Illkirch Graffenstaden, France.",auwerx@igbmc.u-strasbg.fr,"Bianco, Antonio/A-4965-2008","Bianco, Antonio/0000-0001-7737-6813; Houten, Sander/0000-0002-6167-9147",,,,25,870,911,13,114,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,26-Jan,2006,439,7075,,,,,484,489,,10.1038/nature04330,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,005XH,WOS:000234859200049,16400329,No,,,11/20/17

Influenza A viruses are enveloped, spherical or filamentous structures, ranging from 80 to 120 nm in diameter(1). Inside each envelope is a viral genome consisting of eight single-stranded negative- sense RNA segments of 890 to 2,341 nucleotides each(1). These segments are associated with nucleoprotein and three polymerase subunits, designated PA, PB1 and PB2; the resultant ribonucleoprotein complexes (RNPs) resemble a twisted rod ( 10 - 15 nm in width and 30 - 120 nm in length) that is folded back and coiled on itself(2-4). Late in viral infection, newly synthesized RNPs are transported from the nucleus to the plasma membrane, where they are incorporated into progeny virions capable of infecting other cells. Here we show, by transmission electron microscopy of serially sectioned virions, that the RNPs of influenza A virus are organized in a distinct pattern ( seven segments of different lengths surrounding a central segment). The individual RNPs are suspended from the interior of the viral envelope at the distal end of the budding virion and are oriented perpendicular to the budding tip. This finding argues against random incorporation of RNPs into virions(5), supporting instead a model in which each segment contains specific incorporation signals that enable the RNPs to be recruited and packaged as a complete set(6-12). A selective mechanism of RNP incorporation into virions and the unique organization of the eight RNP segments may be crucial to maintaining the integrity of the viral genome during repeated cycles of replication.","Univ Tokyo, Inst Med Sci, Internal Res Ctr Infect Dis, Minato Ku, Tokyo 1088639, Japan; Hokkaido Univ, Grad Sch Vet Med, Dept Dis Control, Microbiol Lab,Kita Ku, Sapporo, Hokkaido 0600818, Japan; Japan SCi & Technol Agcy, Core Res Evolut Sci & Technol, Kawaguchi, Saitama 3320012, Japan; Univ Tokyo, Inst Med Sci, Div Virol, Tokyo 1088639, Japan; Univ Tokyo, Dept Basic Med Sci, Fine Morphol Lab, Minato Ku, Tokyo 1088639, Japan; Karolinska Inst, Dept Biosci, S-14157 Huddinge, Sweden; Univ Tokyo, Inst Med Sci, Dept Microbiol & Immunol, Minato Ku, Tokyo 1088639, Japan; Univ Calif Davis, Davis, CA 95616 USA; Univ Wisconsin, Sch Vet Med, Dept Pathol Sci, Madison, WI 53706 USA","Kawaoka, Y (reprint author), Univ Tokyo, Inst Med Sci, Internal Res Ctr Infect Dis, Minato Ku, Tokyo 1088639, Japan.",Kawaoka@ims.u-tokyo.ac.jp,"Cheng, Holland/A-8973-2008; Takada, Ayato/A-6679-2012; Kida, Hiroshi/F-7244-2012",,,,,18,213,226,1,37,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,26-Jan,2006,439,7075,,,,,490,492,,10.1038/nature04378,,3,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,005XH,WOS:000234859200050,16437116,No,,,11/20/17

When, as a result of an atypical cell division, a cell is displaced from a hair file into a non-hair file, it switches fate(6). We show that during this event the chromatin state around the GL2 locus is not inherited, but is reorganized in the G1 phase of the cell cycle in response to local positional information.

Budding-yeast histone H2A is phosphorylated in a similar manner by the checkpoint kinases Tel1 and Mec1 (ref. 2; orthologous to mammalian ATM and ATR, respectively) over a 50-kilobase region surrounding the DSB3. This modification is important for recruiting numerous DSB-recognition and repair factors to the break site, including DNA damage checkpoint proteins(4,5), chromatin remodellers(6) and cohesins(7,8). Multiple mechanisms for eliminating gamma H2AX as DNA repair completes are possible, including removal by histone exchange followed potentially by degradation, or, alternatively, dephosphorylation. Here we describe a three-protein complex (HTP-C, for histone H2A phosphatase complex) containing the phosphatase Pph3 that regulates the phosphorylation status of gamma H2AX in vivo and efficiently dephosphorylates gamma H2AX in vitro. gamma H2AX is lost from chromatin surrounding a DSB independently of the HTP-C, indicating that the phosphatase targets gamma H2AX after its displacement from DNA.

Although a number of microRNAs have been isolated from the mammalian brain, neither the specific microRNAs that regulate synapse function nor their target mRNAs have been identified. Here we show that a brain-specific microRNA, miR-134, is localized to the synaptodendritic compartment of rat hippocampal neurons and negatively regulates the size of dendritic spines-postsynaptic sites of excitatory synaptic transmission. This effect is mediated by miR-134 inhibition of the translation of an mRNA encoding a protein kinase, Limk1, that controls spine development.

The interaction between FCA and ABA has molecular effects on downstream events in the autonomous floral pathway and, consequently, on the ability of the plant to undergo transition to flowering.

In 1960, proton-rich nuclei with an odd or an even atomic number Z were predicted(1) to decay through one- and two-proton radioactivity, respectively. The experimental observation of one- proton radioactivity was first reported(2) in 1982, and two-proton radioactivity has now also been detected by experimentally studying the decay properties of Fe-45 (refs 3, 4) and Zn-54 (ref. 5). Here we report proton-proton correlations observed during the radioactive decay of a spinning long-lived state of the lightest known isotope of silver(6), Ag-94, which is known to undergo one- proton decay(7). We infer from these correlations that the long-lived state must also decay through simultaneous two-proton emission, making Ag-94 the first nucleus to exhibit one-as well as two-proton radioactivity. We attribute the two-proton emission behaviour and the unexpectedly large probability for this decay mechanism to a very large deformation of the parent nucleus into a prolate (cigar-like) shape, which facilitates emission of protons either from the same or from opposite ends of the 'cigar'.","Gesell Schwerionenforsch mbH, D-64291 Darmstadt, Germany; Katholieke Univ Leuven, Inst Kern & Stralingsfys, B-3001 Louvain, Belgium; IV Kurchatov Atom Energy Inst, RU-123184 Moscow, Russia; St Petersburg Nucl Phys Inst, RU-188350 Gatchina, Russia; Univ Sofia, BG-1164 Sofia, Bulgaria; Joint Inst Nucl Res Dubna, Flerov Lab Nucl React, RU-141980 Dubna, Russia; Univ Warsaw, PL-00681 Warsaw, Poland; Univ Naples Federico 2, I-80126 Naples, Italy; Ist Nazl Fis Nucl, I-80126 Naples, Italy; Florida State Univ, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA","Mukha, I (reprint author), Univ Seville, ES-41080 Seville, Spain.",I.Mukha@gsi.de,,"Mukha, Ivan/0000-0003-3072-5670",,,,30,92,98,3,15,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,19-Jan,2006,439,7074,,,,,298,302,,10.1038/nature04453,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,003LA,WOS:000234682100036,16421564,No,,,11/20/17

Geometrical frustration, which arises from the topology of a well-ordered structure rather than from disorder, has recently become a topic of considerable interest(1). In particular, geometrical frustration among spins in magnetic materials can lead to exotic low-temperature states(2), including 'spin ice', in which the local moments mimic the frustration of hydrogen ion positions in frozen water(3-6). Here we report an artificial geometrically frustrated magnet based on an array of lithographically fabricated single-domain ferromagnetic islands. The islands are arranged such that the dipole interactions create a two-dimensional analogue to spin ice. Images of the magnetic moments of individual elements in this correlated system allow us to study the local accommodation of frustration. We see both ice-like short-range correlations and an absence of long-range correlations, behaviour which is strikingly similar to the low-temperature state of spin ice. These results demonstrate that artificial frustrated magnets can provide an uncharted arena in which the physics of frustration can be directly visualized.","Penn State Univ, Dept Phys, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; Penn State Univ, Mat Res Inst, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; Univ Minnesota, Dept Chem Engn & Mat Sci, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA","Schiffer, P (reprint author), Penn State Univ, Dept Phys, University Pk, PA 16802 USA.",schiffer@phys.psu.edu,"Schiffer, Peter/F-3227-2011; Freitas, Rafael/K-1034-2013; Li, Jie/L-5091-2013; Li, Jie/D-9021-2014; Samarth, Nitin/C-4475-2014; wang, ruifang/D-3037-2016","Samarth, Nitin/0000-0003-2599-346X; wang, ruifang/0000-0002-8456-9776; Crespi, Vincent/0000-0003-3846-3193; Schiffer, Peter/0000-0002-6430-6549; Freitas, Rafael/0000-0002-0225-6195",,,,25,373,374,11,142,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,19-Jan,2006,439,7074,,,,,303,306,,10.1038/nature04447,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,003LA,WOS:000234682100037,16421565,No,,,11/20/17

Cracks moving at low speeds create atomically flat mirror-like surfaces; at higher speeds, rougher, less reflective ('mist') and finally very rough, irregularly faceted ('hackle') surfaces(1-5) are formed. The behaviour is observed in many different brittle materials, but the underlying physical principles, though extensively debated, remain unresolved(1-4). Most existing theories of fracture(6-12) assume a linear elastic stress-strain law. However, the relation between stress and strain in real solids is strongly nonlinear due to large deformations near a moving crack tip, a phenomenon referred to as hyperelasticity(13-17). Here we use massively parallel large-scale atomistic simulations-employing a simple atomistic material model that allows a systematic transition from linear elastic to strongly nonlinear behaviour-to show that hyperelasticity plays a governing role in the onset of the instability. We report a generalized model that describes the onset of instability as a competition between different mechanisms controlled by the local stress field(6-8) and local energy flow(13,14) near the crack tip. Our results indicate that such instabilities are intrinsic to dynamical fracture and they help to explain a range of controversial experimental(1-5,18) and computational(19-26) results.","MIT, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; Max Planck Inst Met Res, D-70569 Stuttgart, Germany","Buehler, MJ (reprint author), MIT, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, 77 Massachusetts Ave,Room 1-272, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",mbuehler@MIT.EDU,"Buehler, Markus/C-4580-2008; Gao, Huajian/F-9360-2010","Buehler, Markus/0000-0002-4173-9659; ",,,,30,168,173,5,67,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,19-Jan,2006,439,7074,,,,,307,310,,10.1038/nature04408,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,003LA,WOS:000234682100038,16421566,No,,,11/20/17

Such projections of sea level change depend on estimated future greenhouse emissions and on differing models, but model-average results from a mid-range scenario (A1B) suggests a 0.387-m rise by 2100 (refs 1, 2). The largest contributions to sea level rise are estimated to come from thermal expansion (0.288 m) and the melting of mountain glaciers and icecaps (0.106 m), with smaller inputs from Greenland (0.024 m) and Antarctica (20.074 m)(1). Here we apply a melt model(3) and a geometric volume model(4) to our lower estimate of ice volume(5-7) and assess the contribution of glaciers to sea level rise, excluding those in Greenland and Antarctica. We provide the first separate assessment of melt contributions from mountain glaciers and icecaps, as well as an improved treatment of volume shrinkage. We find that icecaps melt more slowly than mountain glaciers, whose area declines rapidly in the 21st century, making glaciers a limiting source for ice melt. Using two climate models, we project sea level rise due to melting of mountain glaciers and icecaps to be 0.046 and 0.051 m by 2100, about half that of previous projections(1,8).","Alfred Wegener Inst Polar & Marine Res, D-27515 Bremerhaven, Germany; Univ Manchester, Sch Environm & Dev, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England","Raper, SCB (reprint author), Manchester Metropolitan Univ, Dalton Res Inst, CATE, Manchester M1 5GD, Lancs, England.",s.raper@mmu.ac.uk,,"Braithwaite, Roger/0000-0002-0387-7591",,,,23,158,173,4,43,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,19-Jan,2006,439,7074,,,,,311,313,,10.1038/nature04448,,3,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,003LA,WOS:000234682100039,16421567,No,,,11/20/17

The lavas erupted at Hawaii have attracted particular attention, as it has been proposed that coupled Os-186 and Os-187 anomalies reflect interaction with the Earth's metallic core(1,2). It has recently been suggested, however, that such variations could also result from addition of oceanic ferromanganese sediments to the mantle source of these lavas(3-5). Here we show that Hawaiian picrites with osmium isotope anomalies also exhibit pronounced thallium isotope variations, which are coupled with caesium/thallium ratios that extend to values much lower than commonly observed for mantle-derived rocks. This correlation cannot be created by admixing of core material, and is best explained by the addition of ferromanganese sediments into the Hawaii mantle source region. However, the lack of correlation between thallium and osmium isotopes and the high thallium/osmium ratios of ferromanganese sediments preclude a sedimentary origin for the osmium isotope anomalies, and leaves core-mantle interaction as a viable explanation for the osmium isotope variations of the Hawaiian picrites.","ETH, Dept Earth Sci, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland; Macquarie Univ, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, GEMOC, N Ryde, NSW 2109, Australia; Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Dept Earth Sci & Engn, London SW7 2AZ, England; Australian Natl Univ, Res Sch Earth Sci, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia; Univ Oxford, Dept Earth Sci, Oxford OX1 3PR, England","Nielsen, SG (reprint author), ETH, Dept Earth Sci, Sonneggstr 5, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland.",snielsen@els.mq.edu.au,"Nielsen, Sune/C-7345-2011; GAU, geochemist/H-1985-2016","Rehkamper, Mark/0000-0002-0075-9872; Nielsen, Sune/0000-0002-0458-3739; Norman, Marc/0000-0002-1357-5415",,,,32,61,63,0,19,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,19-Jan,2006,439,7074,,,,,314,317,,10.1038/nature04450,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,003LA,WOS:000234682100040,16421568,No,,,11/20/17

For example, the earliest stages in the remodelling of the spiracular tract and suspensorium (jaw suspension) of osteolepiform fishes(2-4) into the middle ear of tetrapods have remained elusive(3). The most primitive known tetrapods show a middle ear architecture that is very different from osteolepiforms such as Eusthenopteron(3), with little indication of how this transformation took place. Here we present an analysis of tetrapod middle ear origins that is based on a detailed study of Panderichthys, the immediate sister taxon of tetrapods. We show that the spiracular region is radically transformed from osteolepiforms and represents the earliest stages in the origin of the tetrapod middle ear architecture. The posterior palatoquadrate of Panderichthys is completely tetrapod-like and defines a similarly tetrapod-like spiracular tract. The hyomandibula has lost its distal portion, representing a previously unrecognized advance towards a stapes-like morphology. This spiracular specialization suggests that the middle ear of early tetrapods evolved initially as part of a spiracular breathing apparatus(5,6).","Uppsala Univ, Evolutionary Biol Ctr, Dept Physiol & Dev Biol, Subdept Evolutionary Organismal Biol, SE-75236 Uppsala, Sweden","Brazeau, MD (reprint author), Uppsala Univ, Evolutionary Biol Ctr, Dept Physiol & Dev Biol, Subdept Evolutionary Organismal Biol, Norbyv 18A, SE-75236 Uppsala, Sweden.",martin.brazeau@ebc.uu.se,"Brazeau, Martin/B-6971-2009; Ahlberg, Per/E-8086-2013","Brazeau, Martin/0000-0001-6566-2820; Brazeau, Martin/0000-0002-0650-1282",,,,26,46,50,3,40,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,19-Jan,2006,439,7074,,,,,318,321,,10.1038/nature04196,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,003LA,WOS:000234682100041,16421569,No,,,11/20/17

These deep layers of high chlorophyll concentration reflect a compromise of phytoplankton growth exposed to two opposing resource gradients: light supplied from above and nutrients supplied from below. It is often argued that DCMs are stable features. Here we show, however, that reduced vertical mixing can generate oscillations and chaos in phytoplankton biomass and species composition of DCMs. These fluctuations are caused by a difference in the timescales of two processes: (1) rapid export of sinking plankton, withdrawing nutrients from the euphotic zone and (2) a slow upward flux of nutrients fuelling new phytoplankton production. Climate models predict that global warming will reduce vertical mixing in the oceans(8-11). Our model indicates that reduced mixing will generate more variability in DCMs, thereby enhancing variability in oceanic primary production and in carbon export into the ocean interior.","Univ Amsterdam, Inst Biodivers & Ecosyst Dynam, NL-1018 WS Amsterdam, Netherlands; CWI, NL-1090 GB Amsterdam, Netherlands; Univ Hawaii, Sch Ocean & Earth Sci & Technol, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA","Huisman, J (reprint author), Univ Amsterdam, Inst Biodivers & Ecosyst Dynam, Nieuwe Achtergracht 127, NL-1018 WS Amsterdam, Netherlands.",jef.huisman@science.uva.nl,"Huisman, Jef/A-1089-2013",,,,,26,166,176,6,67,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,19-Jan,2006,439,7074,,,,,322,325,,10.1038/nature04245,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,003LA,WOS:000234682100042,16421570,No,,,11/20/17

Here we report the identification of a novel locus, MGC1203, that contributes epistatic alleles to Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS), a pleiotropic, oligogenic disorder(2-9). MGC1203 encodes a pericentriolar protein that interacts and colocalizes with the BBS proteins. Sequencing of two independent BBS cohorts revealed a significant enrichment of a heterozygous C430T mutation in patients, and a transmission disequilibrium test (TDT) showed strong over-transmission of this variant. Further analyses showed that the 430T allele enhances the use of a cryptic splice acceptor site, causing the introduction of a premature termination codon (PTC) and the reduction of steady-state MGC1203 messenger RNA levels. Finally, recapitulation of the human genotypes in zebrafish shows that modest suppression of mgc1203 exerts an epistatic effect on the developmental phenotype of BBS morphants.

Here we show that electrical microstimulation applied to gaze control circuitry in the forebrain of barn owls regulates the gain of midbrain auditory responses in an attention-like manner. When the forebrain circuit was activated, midbrain responses to auditory stimuli at the location encoded by the forebrain site were enhanced and spatial selectivity was sharpened. The same stimulation suppressed responses to auditory stimuli represented at other locations in the midbrain map. Such space-specific, top-down regulation of auditory responses by gaze control circuitry in the barn owl suggests that the central nervous system uses a common strategy for dynamically regulating sensory gain that applies across modalities, brain areas and classes of vertebrate species. This approach provides a path for discovering mechanisms that underlie top-down gain control in the central nervous system.","Stanford Univ, Dept Neurobiol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA","Winkowski, DE (reprint author), Stanford Univ, Dept Neurobiol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",dwinkows@stanford.edu,,,"NIDCD NIH HHS [F32 DC006569-02, F32 DC006569, F32 DC006569-01A2, R01 DC000155, R01 DC000155-28]",,,30,62,62,0,5,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,19-Jan,2006,439,7074,,,,,336,339,,10.1038/nature04411,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,003LA,WOS:000234682100045,16421572,No,,,11/20/17

Constant darkness is considered a 'free-running' circadian state. Mammals encounter constant darkness during hibernation(2). Ablation of the master clock synchronizer, the suprachiasmatic nucleus, abolishes torpor, a hibernation-like state, implicating the circadian clock in this phenomenon(2,3). Here we report a mechanism by which constant darkness regulates the gene expression of fat catabolic enzymes in mice. Genes for murine procolipase (mClps) and pancreatic lipase-related protein 2 (mPlrp2) are activated in a circadian manner in peripheral organs during 12 h dark: 12 h dark (DD) but not light-dark (LD) cycles. This mechanism is deregulated in circadian-deficient mPer1(-/-)/mPer2(m/m) mice. We identified circadian-regulated 5'-AMP, which is elevated in the blood of DD mice, as a key mediator of this response. Synthetic 5'-AMP induced torpor and mClps expression in LD animals. Torpor induced by metabolic stress was associated with elevated 5'-AMP levels in DD mice. Levels of glucose and non-esterified fatty acid in the blood are reversed in DD and LD mice. Induction of mClps expression by 5'-AMP in LD mice was reciprocally linked to blood glucose levels. Our findings uncover a circadian metabolic rhythm in mammals.","Univ Texas, Hlth Sci Ctr, Dept Biochem & Mol Biol, Houston, TX 77030 USA; Univ Tartu, Inst Mol & Cell Biol, Dept Biotechnol, EE-51010 Tartu, Estonia","Lee, CC (reprint author), Univ Texas, Hlth Sci Ctr, Dept Biochem & Mol Biol, Houston, TX 77030 USA.",cheng.c.lee@uth.tmc.edu,,"Blackburn, Michael/0000-0002-1394-9966",,,,29,128,134,0,23,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,19-Jan,2006,439,7074,,,,,340,343,,10.1038/nature04368,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,003LA,WOS:000234682100046,16421573,No,,,11/20/17

Quasispecies arise from rapid genomic evolution powered by the high mutation rate of RNA viral replication(5-8). Although a high mutation rate is dangerous for a virus because it results in nonviable individuals, it has been hypothesized that high mutation rates create a 'cloud' of potentially beneficial mutations at the population level, which afford the viral quasispecies a greater probability to evolve and adapt to new environments and challenges during infection(4,9-11). Mathematical models predict that viral quasispecies are not simply a collection of diverse mutants but a group of interactive variants, which together contribute to the characteristics of the population(4,12). According to this view, viral populations, rather than individual variants, are the target of evolutionary selection(4,12). Here we test this hypothesis by examining the consequences of limiting genomic diversity on viral populations. We find that poliovirus carrying a high-fidelity polymerase replicates at wild-type levels but generates less genomic diversity and is unable to adapt to adverse growth conditions. In infected animals, the reduced viral diversity leads to loss of neurotropism and an attenuated pathogenic phenotype. Notably, using chemical mutagenesis to expand quasispecies diversity of the high-fidelity virus before infection restores neurotropism and pathogenesis. Analysis of viruses isolated from brain provides direct evidence for complementation between members in the quasispecies, indicating that selection indeed occurs at the population level rather than on individual variants. Our study provides direct evidence for a fundamental prediction of the quasispecies theory and establishes a link between mutation rate, population dynamics and pathogenesis.","Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Microbiol & Immunol, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; Penn State Univ, Dept Biochem & Mol Biol, University Pk, PA 16802 USA","Andino, R (reprint author), Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Microbiol & Immunol, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA.",andino@itsa.ucsf.edu,,"Vignuzzi, Marco/0000-0002-4400-771X","NIAID NIH HHS [U01 AI054776, N01AI40085, R01 AI036178, R01 AI040085, R01 AI045818, R01 AI045818-07, R01 AI045818-08]",,,24,496,511,4,44,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,19-Jan,2006,439,7074,,,,,344,348,,10.1038/nature04388,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,003LA,WOS:000234682100047,16327776,No,,,11/20/17

In pancreatic beta-cells, cAMP potentiates Ca2+-dependent exocytosis(1-3) and mediates the stimulation of insulin release exerted by the hormones glucagon and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) (refs 4-6). Whereas Ca2+ signals have been extensively characterized and shown to involve oscillations important for the temporal control of insulin secretion(4,7,8), the kinetics of receptor-triggered cAMP signals is unknown. Here we introduce a new ratiometric evanescent-wave-microscopy approach to measure cAMP concentration beneath the plasma membrane, and show that insulin-secreting beta-cells respond to glucagon and GLP-1 with marked cAMP oscillations. Simultaneous measurements of intracellular Ca2+ concentration revealed that the two messengers are interlinked and reinforce each other. Moreover, cAMP oscillations are capable of inducing rapid on-off Ca2+ responses, but only sustained elevation of cAMP concentration induces nuclear translocation of the catalytic subunit of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase. Our results establish a new signalling mode for cAMP and indicate that temporal encoding of cAMP signals might constitute a basis for differential regulation of downstream cellular targets.","Uppsala Univ, BMC, Dept Med Cell Biol, SE-75123 Uppsala, Sweden; Kiev T Shevchenko Natl Univ, Dept Biophys, UA-01033 Kiev, Ukraine","Tengholm, A (reprint author), Uppsala Univ, BMC, Dept Med Cell Biol, Box 571, SE-75123 Uppsala, Sweden.",anders.tengholm@medcellbiol.uu.se,"Dyachok, Oleg/B-5935-2017",,,,,29,166,170,2,17,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,19-Jan,2006,439,7074,,,,,349,352,,10.1038/nature04410,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,003LA,WOS:000234682100048,16421574,No,,,11/20/17

Various studies have also demonstrated the potential for using gene expression profiles for the analysis of oncogenic pathways(5-11). Here we show that gene expression signatures can be identified that reflect the activation status of several oncogenic pathways. When evaluated in several large collections of human cancers, these gene expression signatures identify patterns of pathway deregulation in tumours and clinically relevant associations with disease outcomes. Combining signature-based predictions across several pathways identifies coordinated patterns of pathway deregulation that distinguish between specific cancers and tumour subtypes. Clustering tumours based on pathway signatures further defines prognosis in respective patient subsets, demonstrating that patterns of oncogenic pathway deregulation underlie the development of the oncogenic phenotype and reflect the biology and outcome of specific cancers. Predictions of pathway deregulation in cancer cell lines are also shown to predict the sensitivity to therapeutic agents that target components of the pathway. Linking pathway deregulation with sensitivity to therapeutics that target components of the pathway provides an opportunity to make use of these oncogenic pathway signatures to guide the use of targeted therapeutics.","Duke Univ, Inst Genome Sci & Policy, Durham, NC 27708 USA; Duke Univ, Med Ctr, Dept Mol Genet & Microbiol, Durham, NC 27710 USA; Duke Univ, Med Ctr, Dept Surg, Durham, NC 27710 USA; Duke Univ, Med Ctr, Dept Med, Durham, NC 27710 USA; Duke Univ, Med Ctr, Dept Obstet & Gynecol, Durham, NC 27710 USA; Duke Univ, Inst Stat & Decis Sci, Durham, NC 27708 USA; Univ S Florida, H Lee Moffitt Canc Ctr & Res Inst, Tampa, FL 33612 USA","Nevins, JR (reprint author), Duke Univ, Inst Genome Sci & Policy, Durham, NC 27708 USA.",j.nevins@duke.edu,"Tang, Amy/L-3226-2016","Tang, Amy/0000-0002-5772-2878","NCI NIH HHS [K23 CA106595, R21 CA108707]",,,24,1241,1279,5,73,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,19-Jan,2006,439,7074,,,,,353,357,,10.1038/nature04296,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,003LA,WOS:000234682100049,16273092,No,,,11/20/17

This MEK dependency was observed in BRAF mutant cells regardless of tissue lineage, and correlated with both downregulation of cyclin D1 protein expression and the induction of G1 arrest. Pharmacological MEK inhibition completely abrogated tumour growth in BRAF mutant xenografts, whereas RAS mutant tumours were only partially inhibited. These data suggest an exquisite dependency on MEK activity in BRAF mutant tumours, and offer a rational therapeutic strategy for this genetically defined tumour subtype.","Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Dept Med, New York, NY 10021 USA; Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Dept Pediat, New York, NY 10021 USA; Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Dept Mol Pharmacol & Chem, New York, NY 10021 USA; Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dana Farber Canc Inst, Dept Med Oncol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dana Farber Canc Inst, Dept Pediat Oncol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; Harvard Univ, Broad Inst, Cambridge, MA 02141 USA; MIT, Cambridge, MA 02141 USA; NYU Med Ctr, Dept Med, New York, NY 10016 USA; NYU Med Ctr, Dept Urol, New York, NY 10016 USA; Pfizer Global Res & Dev, Ann Arbor, MI 48105 USA","Rosen, N (reprint author), Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Dept Med, 1275 York Ave, New York, NY 10021 USA.",rosenn@mskcc.org,"Tang, Amy/L-3226-2016","Tang, Amy/0000-0002-5772-2878","NCI NIH HHS [P01 CA094060, P01 CA094060-01A1, T32 CA009172]",,,28,877,902,3,36,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,19-Jan,2006,439,7074,,,,,358,362,,10.1038/nature04304,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,003LA,WOS:000234682100050,16273091,No,,,11/20/17

In many cases, the smaller planet escapes from the collision highly deformed, spun up, depressurized from equilibrium, stripped of its outer layers, and sometimes pulled apart into a chain of diverse objects.

An estimated 67% of the 110 or so species of Atelopus, which are endemic to the American tropics, have met the same fate, and a pathogenic chytrid fungus (Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis) is implicated. Analysing the timing of losses in relation to changes in sea surface and air temperatures, we conclude with 'very high confidence' (>99%, following the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, IPCC) that large-scale warming is a key factor in the disappearances. We propose that temperatures at many highland localities are shifting towards the growth optimum of Batrachochytrium, thus encouraging outbreaks.

This involved 77,592 independent biochemical measurements and provided a quantitative protein interaction network that reveals many new interactions, including ones that fall outside of our current view of domain selectivity. By slicing through the network at different affinity thresholds, we found surprising differences between the receptors. Most notably, EGFR and ErbB2 become markedly more promiscuous as the threshold is lowered, whereas ErbB3 does not. Because EGFR and ErbB2 are overexpressed in many human cancers, our results suggest that the extent to which promiscuity changes with protein concentration may contribute to the oncogenic potential of receptor tyrosine kinases, and perhaps other signalling proteins as well.","Harvard Univ, Dept Chem & Biol Chem, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; Harvard Univ, Program Biophys, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA","MacBeath, G (reprint author), Harvard Univ, Dept Chem & Biol Chem, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",macbeath@chemistry.harvard.edu,,,,,,36,483,503,2,41,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,12-Jan,2006,439,7073,,,,,168,174,,10.1038/nature04177,,7,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,001MT,WOS:000234538400032,16273093,No,,,11/20/17

Frequent reports of small-scale flux ropes and flow channels associated with reconnection(8-13) in the Earth's magnetosphere raise the possibility that reconnection is intrinsically patchy, with each reconnection X-line ( the line along which oppositely directed magnetic field lines reconnect) extending at most a few Earth radii (R-E), even though the associated current sheets span many tens or hundreds of R-E. Here we report three-spacecraft observations of accelerated flow associated with reconnection in a current sheet embedded in the solar wind flow, where the reconnection X-line extended at least 390R(E) ( or 2.5 x 10(6) km). Observations of this and 27 similar events imply that reconnection is fundamentally a large-scale process. Patchy reconnection observed in the Earth's magnetosphere is therefore likely to be a geophysical effect associated with fluctuating boundary conditions, rather than a fundamental property of reconnection.

The radiative decay of biexcitons - that is, states consisting of two bound electron - hole pairs - in a quantum dot has been proposed as a source of triggered polarization-entangled photon pairs(6). To date, however, experiments have indicated that a splitting of the intermediate exciton energy yields only classically correlated emission(7-9). Here we demonstrate triggered photon pair emission from single quantum dots suggestive of polarization entanglement. We achieve this by tuning the splitting to zero, through either application of an in-plane magnetic field or careful control of growth conditions. Entangled photon pairs generated 'on demand' have significant fundamental advantages over other schemes(10-13), which can suffer from multiple pair emission, or require post-selection techniques or the use of photon-number discriminating detectors. Furthermore, control over the pair generation time is essential for scaling many quantum information schemes beyond a few gates. Our results suggest that a triggered entangled photon pair source could be implemented by a simple semiconductor light-emitting diode(14).","Toshiba Res Europe Ltd, Cambridge CB4 OWE, England; Univ Cambridge, Cavendish Lab, Cambridge CB3 0HE, England","Stevenson, RM (reprint author), Toshiba Res Europe Ltd, 260 Cambridge Sci Pk, Cambridge CB4 OWE, England.",mark.stevenson@crl.toshiba.co.uk,"Young, Robert/D-8454-2011","Young, Robert/0000-0002-5719-2205",,,,30,609,618,11,136,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,12-Jan,2006,439,7073,,,,,179,182,,10.1038/nature04446,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,001MT,WOS:000234538400034,16407947,No,,,11/20/17

It occurs with many substances(1-5), particularly those that can readily be produced as high-quality crystals. In principle, ice should also be amenable to superheating. But the complex three-dimensional network of hydrogen bonds that holds water molecules together and gives rise to unusual solid and liquid properties(6-11) strongly affects the melting behaviour of ice(12-14); in particular, ice usually contains many defects owing to the directionality of its hydrogen bonds. However, simulations are readily able to 'create' defect- free ice that can be superheated(15,16). Here we show that by exciting the OH stretching mode of water, it is possible to superheat ice. When using an ice sample at an initial temperature of 270 K, we observe an average temperature rise of 20 +/- 2K that persists over the monitored time interval of 250 ps without melting.","Tech Univ Munich, Dept Phys, D-85748 Garching, Germany","Iglev, H (reprint author), Tech Univ Munich, Dept Phys, James Franck Str, D-85748 Garching, Germany.",higlev@ph.tum.de,,,,,,30,74,75,4,37,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,12-Jan,2006,439,7073,,,,,183,186,,10.1038/nature04415,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,001MT,WOS:000234538400035,16407948,No,,,11/20/17

Significant methane emissions from both intact plants and detached leaves were observed during incubation experiments in the laboratory and in the field. If our measurements are typical for short-lived biomass and scaled on a global basis, we estimate a methane source strength of 62 - 236 Tg yr(-1) for living plants and 1 - 7 Tg yr(-1) for plant litter (1 Tg = 10(12) g).

The density of silicate melt under dry conditions has been measured at high pressure(4,6-13) and found to be denser than the surrounding solid, thereby allowing the melt to remain at depth. But no experimental investigation of the density of hydrous melt has yet been carried out. Here we present data constraining the density of hydrous basaltic melt under pressure to examine the stability of melt above the 410-km discontinuity.

But unlike the closely related spalacotheroids and living therians, this new mammal revealed some surprisingly convergent features to monotremes in the lumbar vertebrae, pelvis and hindlimb(12,13). These peculiar features may have developed as functional convergence to locomotory features of monotremes, or the presence of lumbar ribs in this newly discovered mammal and their absence in its close relatives might be due to evolutionary developmental homoplasy. Analysis including this new taxon suggests that spalacotheroids evolved earlier in Eurasia and then dispersed to North America, in concordance with prevailing geodispersal patterns of several common mammalian groups during the Early Cretaceous period.","Carnegie Museum Nat Hist, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA; Nanjing Univ, Dept Earth Sci, Nanjing 200017, Peoples R China; Chinese Acad Sci, Nanjing Inst Geol & Palaeontol, Nanjing 210008, Peoples R China","Luo, ZX (reprint author), Carnegie Museum Nat Hist, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA.",luoz@carnegiemnh.org,,,,,,30,52,56,2,17,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,12-Jan,2006,439,7073,,,,,195,200,,10.1038/nature04168,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,001MT,WOS:000234538400038,16407951,No,,,11/20/17

Insemination by multiple males shifts the arena for sexual selection from the external environment to the female reproductive tract, where sperm competition or female choice of sperm could bias fertilization against sperm from genetically inferior(5) or genetically incompatible males(6,7). Evidence that polyandry can be a strategy for avoiding incompatibility comes from studies showing that inbreeding cost is reduced in some egg-laying species by postcopulatory mechanisms that favour fertilization by sperm from unrelated males(8-10). In viviparous (live-bearing) species, inbreeding not only reduces offspring genetic quality but might also disrupt feto-maternal interactions that are crucial for normal embryonic development(11-13). Here we show that polyandry in viviparous pseudoscorpions reduces inbreeding cost not through paternity-biasing mechanisms favouring outbred offspring, but rather because outbred embryos exert a rescuing effect on inbred half-siblings in mixed-paternity broods. The benefits of polyandry may thus be more complex for live-bearing females than for females that lay eggs.","Univ Nevada, Dept Biol, Reno, NV 89557 USA; Univ Nevada, Program Ecol Evolut & Conservat Biol, Reno, NV 89557 USA","Zeh, JA (reprint author), Univ Nevada, Dept Biol, Reno, NV 89557 USA.",jaz@unr.edu,,,,,,27,47,47,2,21,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,12-Jan,2006,439,7073,,,,,201,203,,10.1038/nature04260,,3,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,001MT,WOS:000234538400039,16407952,No,,,11/20/17

TLRs activate downstream effectors through adaptors that contain Toll/interleukin-1 receptor (TIR) domains(2), but the mechanisms accounting for diversification of TLR effector functions are unclear. To dissect biochemically TLR signalling, we established a system for isolating signalling complexes assembled by dimerized adaptors. Using MyD88 as a prototypical adaptor, we identified TNF receptor-associated factor 3 (TRAF3) as a new component of TIR signalling complexes that is recruited along with TRAF6. Using myeloid cells from TRAF3- and TRAF6-deficient mice, we show that TRAF3 is essential for the induction of type I interferons (IFN) and the anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-10 (IL-10), but is dispensable for expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines. In fact, TRAF3- deficient cells overproduce pro-inflammatory cytokines owing to defective IL-10 production. Despite their structural similarity, the functions of TRAF3 and TRAF6 are largely distinct. TRAF3 is also recruited to the adaptor TRIF (Toll/IL-1 receptor domain-containing adaptor-inducing IFN-beta) and is required for marshalling the protein kinase TBK1 ( also called NAK) into TIR signalling complexes, thereby explaining its unique role in activation of the IFN response.","Univ Calif San Diego, Sch Med, Dept Pharmacol, Lab Gene Regulat & Signal Transduct, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Med, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Pathol, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; Univ So Denmark, Dept Biochem & Mol Biol, CEBI, DK-5230 Odense M, Denmark; Tech Univ Munich, Inst Med Microbiol Immunol & Hyg, D-81675 Munich, Germany","Hacker, H (reprint author), St Jude Childrens Res Hosp, Dept Infect Dis, 332 N Lauderdale St, Memphis, TN 38105 USA.",Hans.Haecker@stjude.org,"Haecker, Hans/F-6826-2013; Wang, G Greg/L-6666-2014; Mann, Matthias/A-3454-2013","Wang, G Greg/0000-0002-7210-9940; Mann, Matthias/0000-0003-1292-4799; Hsu, Li-Chung/0000-0001-7206-5231; Blagoev, Blagoy/0000-0002-3596-0066",,,,25,532,581,4,65,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,12-Jan,2006,439,7073,,,,,204,207,,10.1038/nature04369,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,001MT,WOS:000234538400040,16306937,No,,,11/20/17

Furthermore, we show that TRAF3 associates with the TLR adaptors TRIF and IRAK1, as well as downstream IRF3/7 kinases TBK1 and IKK-epsilon, suggesting that TRAF3 serves as a critical link between TLR adaptors and downstream regulatory kinases important for IRF activation. In addition to TLR stimulation, we also show that TRAF3-deficient fibroblasts are defective in their type I IFN response to direct infection with vesicular stomatitis virus, indicating that TRAF3 is also an important component of TLR-independent viral recognition pathways.

Proof of principle experiments have shown that 'customized' ES cells derived by nuclear transfer (NT-ESCs) can be used to correct immunodeficiency in mice. Importantly, the feasibility of the approach has been demonstrated recently in humans, bringing the clinical application of NT- ESCs within reach. Altered nuclear transfer (ANT) has been proposed as a variation of nuclear transfer because it would create abnormal nuclear transfer blastocysts that are inherently unable to implant into the uterus but would be capable of generating customized ES cells. To assess the experimental validity of this concept we have used nuclear transfer to derive mouse blastocysts from donor fibroblasts that carried a short hairpin RNA construct targeting Cdx2.

So far, there have been no reports in the literature of stem cell lines derived using an approach that does not require embryo destruction. Here we report an alternative method of establishing ES cell lines - using a technique of single-cell embryo biopsy similar to that used in pre-implantation genetic diagnosis of genetic defects(10) - that does not interfere with the developmental potential of embryos. Five putative ES and seven trophoblast stem (TS) cell lines were produced from single blastomeres, which maintained normal karyotype and markers of pluripotency or TS cells for up to more than 50 passages. The ES cells differentiated into derivatives of all three germ layers in vitro and in teratomas, and showed germ line transmission.

Mouse and frog models for these birth defects have indicated that Van Gogh-like 2 (Vangl2, also known as Strabismus) and other components of planar cell polarity (PCP) signalling might control neurulation by promoting the convergence of neural progenitors to the midline(2-8). Here we show a novel role for PCP signalling during neurulation in zebrafish. We demonstrate that non-canonical Wnt/PCP signalling polarizes neural progenitors along the anteroposterior axis. This polarity is transiently lost during cell division in the neural keel but is re-established as daughter cells reintegrate into the neuroepithelium. Loss of zebrafish Vangl2 ( in trilobite mutants) abolishes the polarization of neural keel cells, disrupts re-intercalation of daughter cells into the neuroepithelium, and results in ectopic neural progenitor accumulations and NTDs. Remarkably, blocking cell division leads to rescue of trilobite neural tube morphogenesis despite persistent defects in convergence and extension. These results reveal a function for PCP signalling in coupling cell division and morphogenesis at neurulation and indicate a previously unrecognized mechanism that might underlie NTDs.","NYU, Sch Med, Skirball Inst Biomol Med, Dev Genet Program, New York, NY 10016 USA; NYU, Sch Med, Dept Cell Biol, New York, NY 10016 USA; Mt Sinai Sch Med, Brookdale Dept Mol Cellular & Dev Biol, New York, NY 10029 USA","Ciruna, B (reprint author), Hosp Sick Children, Program Dev Biol, Toronto Med Discovery Tower, Toronto, ON M5G 1L7, Canada.",ciruna@sickkids.ca; schier@fas.harvard.edu,,,NIGMS NIH HHS [R01 GM056211],,,30,231,238,2,20,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,12-Jan,2006,439,7073,,,,,220,224,,10.1038/nature04375,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,001MT,WOS:000234538400044,16407953,No,,,11/20/17

Such TLS can be accurate or error-prone, as it is for bypass of a cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer by DNA polymerase h (XP-V or Rad30) or bypass of a (6-4) TT photoproduct by DNA polymerase V (UmuD'C-2), respectively(2,3). Although DinB is the only Y-family DNA polymerase conserved among all domains of life, the biological rationale for this striking conservation has remained enigmatic(4). Here we report that the Escherichia coli dinB gene is required for resistance to some DNA-damaging agents that form adducts at the N-2-position of deoxyguanosine (dG). We show that DinB (DNA polymerase IV) catalyses accurate TLS over one such N-2-dG adduct (N-2-furfuryl-dG), and that DinB and its mammalian orthologue, DNA polymerase kappa, insert deoxycytidine (dC) opposite N-2-furfuryl-dG with 10-15-fold greater catalytic proficiency than opposite undamaged dG. We also show that mutating a single amino acid, the 'steric gate' residue of DinB (Phe13 --> Val) and that of its archaeal homologue Dbh (Phe12 --> Ala), separates the abilities of these enzymes to perform TLS over N-2-dG adducts from their abilities to replicate an undamaged template. We propose that DinB and its orthologues are specialized to catalyse relatively accurate TLS over some N-2-dG adducts that are ubiquitous in nature, that lesion bypass occurs more efficiently than synthesis on undamaged DNA, and that this specificity may be achieved at least in part through a lesion-induced conformational change.","MIT, Dept Biol, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; MIT, Dept Chem, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; MIT, Biol Engn Div, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA","Walker, GC (reprint author), MIT, Dept Biol, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",gwalker@mit.edu,,"Jarosz, Daniel/0000-0003-3497-5888; /0000-0001-7243-8261",,,,28,162,164,1,9,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,12-Jan,2006,439,7073,,,,,225,228,,10.1038/nature04318,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,001MT,WOS:000234538400045,16407906,No,,,11/20/17

The model proposed may provide a molecular paradigm of how major sarcomeric filaments are crosslinked, anchored and aligned within complex cytoskeletal networks.","DESY, EMBL Hamburg, D-22603 Hamburg, Germany; Demokritos Natl Ctr Sci Res, Inst Phys Chem, GR-15310 Athens, Greece; Kings Coll London, Randall Div Cell & Mol Biophys, London SE1 1UL, England; Kings Coll London, Div Cardiovasc, London SE1 1UL, England; ETH, Inst Cell Biol, CH-8093 Zurich, Switzerland; Univ Basel, Biozentrum, Div Struct Biol, CH-4056 Basel, Switzerland","Wilmanns, M (reprint author), DESY, EMBL Hamburg, Notleststr 85, D-22603 Hamburg, Germany.",wilmanns@embl-hamburg.de,"Popov, Alexander/A-8827-2008; Lange, Stephan/A-1422-2010; Pinotsis, Nikolaos/G-3853-2011","Mayans, Olga/0000-0001-6876-8532; Wilmanns, Matthias/0000-0002-4643-5435; Popov, Alexander/0000-0002-3058-8912; Lange, Stephan/0000-0001-9361-6602",Medical Research Council [G0200496],,,30,108,111,1,18,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,12-Jan,2006,439,7073,,,,,229,233,,10.1038/nature04343,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,001MT,WOS:000234538400046,16407954,No,,,11/20/17

COPII consists of the Sar1 GTPase, Sec23 and Sec24 (Sec23/24), where Sec23 is a Sar1-specific GTPase-activating protein and Sec24 functions in cargo selection, and Sec13 and Sec31 (Sec13/31), which has a structural role(3). Whereas recent results have shown that Sec23/24 and Sec13/31 can self-assemble to form COPII cage-like particles(4), we now show that Sec13/31 can self-assemble to form minimal cages in the absence of Sec23/24. We present a three-dimensional reconstruction of these Sec13/31 cages at 30 angstrom resolution using cryo-electron microscopy and single particle analysis. These results reveal a novel cuboctahedron geometry with the potential to form a flexible lattice and to generate a diverse range of containers. Our data are consistent with a model for COPII coat complex assembly in which Sec23/24 has a non-structural role as a multivalent ligand localizing the self-assembly of Sec13/31 to form a cage lattice driving ER cargo export.","Scripps Res Inst, Natl Resource Automated Mol Microscopy, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; Scripps Res Inst, Dept Cell, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; Scripps Res Inst, Dept Mol Biol, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; Scripps Res Inst, Dept Chem, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; Scripps Res Inst, Inst Childhood & Neglected Dis, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA","Carragher, B (reprint author), Scripps Res Inst, Natl Resource Automated Mol Microscopy, 10550 N Torrey Pines Rd, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA.",bcarr@scripps.edu; webalch@scripps.edu,"Gurkan, Cemal/S-5751-2016","Gurkan, Cemal/0000-0001-7379-4559; Carragher, Bridget/0000-0002-0624-5020",,,,29,177,184,0,22,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,12-Jan,2006,439,7073,,,,,234,238,,10.1038/nature04339,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,001MT,WOS:000234538400047,16407955,No,,,11/20/17

Ephrin-family proteins are required for both anterior - posterior and medial - lateral topographic mapping, but the opposing forces have not been well characterized. Wnt-family proteins are recently discovered axon guidance cues. We find that Wnt3 is expressed in a medial - lateral decreasing gradient in chick optic tectum and mouse superior colliculus. Retinal ganglion cell (RGC) axons from different dorsal - ventral positions showed graded and biphasic response to Wnt3 in a concentration-dependent manner. Wnt3 repulsion is mediated by Ryk, expressed in a ventral-to-dorsal decreasing gradient, whereas attraction of dorsal axons at lower Wnt3 concentrations is mediated by Frizzled(s). Overexpression of Wnt3 in the lateral tectum repelled the termination zones of dorsal RGC axons in vivo. Expression of a dominant-negative Ryk in dorsal RGC axons caused a medial shift of the termination zones, promoting medially directed interstitial branches and eliminating laterally directed branches. Therefore, a classical morphogen, Wnt3, acting as an axon guidance molecule, plays a role in retinotectal mapping along the medial - lateral axis, counterbalancing the medial-directed EphrinB1-EphB activity.","Univ Chicago, Dept Neurobiol Pharmacol & Physiol, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; Univ Chicago, Comm Dev Biol, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; Univ Chicago, Comm Neurobiol, Chicago, IL 60637 USA","Zou, YM (reprint author), Univ Chicago, Dept Neurobiol Pharmacol & Physiol, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.",yzou@bsd.uchicago.edu,"shi, jun/C-2389-2011",,NINDS NIH HHS [R01 NS047484],,,28,185,189,0,12,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,5-Jan,2006,439,7072,,,,,31,37,,10.1038/nature04334,,7,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,999HA,WOS:000234378700027,16280981,No,,,11/20/17

Here we report the crystal structure of the parainfluenza virus 5 F protein in its prefusion conformation, stabilized by the addition of a carboxy-terminal trimerization domain. The structure of the F protein shows that there are profound conformational differences between the pre- and postfusion states, involving transformations in secondary and tertiary structure.

This led to the conclusion(1) that massive stars throughout the Galaxy dominate the production of Al-26. On the other hand, meteoritic data show evidence for locally produced Al-26, perhaps from spallation reactions in the protosolar disk(3-5). Furthermore, prominent gamma-ray emission from the Cygnus region suggests that a substantial fraction of Galactic Al-26 could originate in localized star-forming regions.

The assembly of nanoparticles of two different materials into a binary nanoparticle superlattice (BNSL)(3-7) can provide a general and inexpensive path to a large variety of materials (metamaterials) with precisely controlled chemical composition and tight placement of the components. Maximization of the nanoparticle packing density has been proposed as the driving force for BNSL formation(3,8,9), and only a few BNSL structures have been predicted to be thermodynamically stable. Recently, colloidal crystals with micrometre-scale lattice spacings have been grown from oppositely charged polymethyl methacrylate spheres(10,11). Here we demonstrate formation of more than 15 different BNSL structures, using combinations of semiconducting, metallic and magnetic nanoparticle building blocks. At least ten of these colloidal crystalline structures have not been reported previously.

A rapid rise of global temperatures during this event accompanied turnovers in both marine(1-3) and terrestrial biota(4), as well as significant changes in ocean chemistry(5,6) and circulation(7,8). Here we present evidence for an abrupt shift in deep-ocean circulation using carbon isotope records from fourteen sites. These records indicate that deep-ocean circulation patterns changed from Southern Hemisphere overturning to Northern Hemisphere overturning at the start of the Palaeocene/ Eocene Thermal Maximum. This shift in the location of deep-water formation persisted for at least 40,000 years, but eventually recovered to original circulation patterns. These results corroborate climate model inferences that a shift in deep-ocean circulation would deliver relatively warmer waters to the deep sea, thus producing further warming(9). Greenhouse conditions can thus initiate abrupt deep-ocean circulation changes in less than a few thousand years, but may have lasting effects; in this case taking 100,000 years to revert to background conditions.","Univ Calif San Diego, Scripps Inst Oceanog, La Jolla, CA 92092 USA","Nunes, F (reprint author), Univ Calif San Diego, Scripps Inst Oceanog, La Jolla, CA 92092 USA.",fnunes@ucsd.edu,"Nunes, Flavia/B-5041-2011","Nunes, Flavia/0000-0002-3947-6634",,,,24,89,97,0,33,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,5-Jan,2006,439,7072,,,,,60,63,,10.1038/nature04386,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,999HA,WOS:000234378700033,16397495,No,,,11/20/17

The geometry of these microcracks and their surrounding elastic stress fields control the orientation of the final shear fracture surfaces(3,4). The classic Coulomb - Mohr failure criterion(5) predicts the development of two conjugate ( bimodal) shear planes that are inclined at an acute angle to the axis of maximum compressive stress. This criterion, however, is incapable of explaining the three-dimensional polymodal fault patterns that are widely observed in rocks(6-9). Here we show that the elastic stress around tensile microcracks in three dimensions promotes a mutual interaction that produces brittle shear planes oriented obliquely to the remote principal stresses, and can therefore account for observed polymodal fault patterns. Our microcrack interaction model is based on the three-dimensional solution of Eshelby(10,11), unlike previous models(4,12) that employed two-dimensional approximations.

Because the phosphate concentrations of many ocean gyres are low(1), the bioavailability of the larger, chemically heterogeneous pool of dissolved organic phosphorus could markedly influence Trichodesmium physiology. Here we describe the induction, by phosphorus stress, of genes from the Trichodesmium erythraeum IMS101 genome that are predicted to encode proteins associated with the high-affinity transport and hydrolysis of phosphonate compounds by a carbon - phosphorus lyase pathway. We show the importance of these genes through expression analyses with T. erythraeum from the Sargasso Sea. Phosphonates are known to be present in oligotrophic marine systems, but have not previously been considered to be bioavailable to marine diazotrophs. The apparent absence of genes encoding a carbon phosphorus lyase pathway in the other marine cyanobacterial genomes suggests that, relative to other phytoplankton, Trichodesmium is uniquely adapted for scavenging phosphorus from organic sources. This adaptation may help to explain the prevalence of Trichodesmium in low phosphate, oligotrophic systems.","Woods Hole Oceanog Inst, Dept Biol, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA; Woods Hole Oceanog Inst, Dept Marine Chem & Geochem, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA","Webb, EA (reprint author), Woods Hole Oceanog Inst, Dept Biol, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA.",ewebb@whoi.edu,"Chappell, P.

They walk, swinging their body over a relatively straight leg with each step, or run, bouncing up off a bent leg between aerial phases. Walking feels easiest when going slowly, and running feels easiest when going faster. More unusual gaits seem more tiring. Perhaps this is because walking and running use the least energy(1-7). Addressing this classic(1) conjecture with experiments(2,3) requires comparing walking and running with many other strange and unpractised gaits. As an alternative, a basic understanding of gait choice might be obtained by calculating energy cost by using mechanics-based models. Here we use a minimal model that can describe walking and running as well as an infinite variety of other gaits. We use computer optimization to find which gaits are indeed energetically optimal for this model. At low speeds the optimization discovers the classic inverted-pendulum walk(8-13), at high speeds it discovers a bouncing run(12,13), even without springs, and at intermediate speeds it finds a new pendular-running gait that includes walking and running as extreme cases.","Cornell Univ, Biorobot & Locomot Lab, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA","Srinivasan, M (reprint author), Cornell Univ, Biorobot & Locomot Lab, 306 Kimball Hall, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",ms285@cornell.edu,"Srinivasan, Manoj/E-8751-2011","Srinivasan, Manoj/0000-0002-7811-3617; Ruina, Andy/0000-0001-5493-6048",,,,30,238,246,2,36,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,5-Jan,2006,439,7072,,,,,72,75,,10.1038/nature04113,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,999HA,WOS:000234378700036,16155564,No,,,11/20/17

Although still the subject of much controversy(2), recent theoretical explanations have focused on the evolutionary origins of worker behaviour ( assistance from daughters that remain in the nest and help their mother to reproduce) through expression of maternal care behaviour towards siblings(3,4). A key prediction of this evolutionary model is that traits involved in maternal care have been co-opted through heterochronous expression of maternal genes(5) to result in sib-care, the hallmark of highly evolved social life in insects(6). A coupling of maternal behaviour to reproductive status evolved in solitary insects, and was a ready substrate for the evolution of worker-containing societies(3,4,7,8). Here we show that division of foraging labour among worker honey bees ( Apis mellifera) is linked to the reproductive status of facultatively sterile females. We thereby identify the evolutionary origin of a widely expressed social-insect behavioural syndrome(1,5,7,9), and provide a direct demonstration of how variation in maternal reproductive traits gives rise to complex social behaviour in non-reproductive helpers.","Arizona State Univ, Sch Life Sci, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA; Univ Life Sci, Dept Anim & Aquacultural Sci, N-1432 As, Norway; Univ Calif Davis, Dept Entomol, Davis, CA 95616 USA","Amdam, GV (reprint author), Arizona State Univ, Sch Life Sci, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA.",Gro.Amdam@asu.edu; Robert.Page@asu.edu,,,"NIA NIH HHS [P01 AG022500, P01 AG022500-04]",,,30,156,163,3,49,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,5-Jan,2006,439,7072,,,,,76,78,,10.1038/nature04340,,3,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,999HA,WOS:000234378700037,16397498,No,,,11/20/17

In the cortical anlage of newborn mammals, neurons coassemble through electrical or chemical synapses either spontaneously(2-4) or by activation of transmitter-gated receptors(5,6). The neuronal network and the cellular mechanisms underlying this cortical self-organization process during early development are not completely understood. Here we show in an intact in vitro preparation of the immature mouse cerebral cortex that neurons are functionally coupled in local clusters by means of propagating network oscillations in the beta frequency range. In the newborn mouse, this activity requires an intact subplate and is strongly synchronized within a cortical column by gap junctions. With the developmental disappearance of the subplate at the end of the first postnatal week(7), activation of NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) receptors in the immature cortical network is essential to generate this columnar activity pattern. Our findings show that during a brief developmental period the cortical network switches from a subplate-driven, gap-junction-coupled syncytium to a synaptic network acting through NMDA receptors to generate synchronized oscillatory activity, which may function as an early functional template for the development of the cortical columnar architecture.","Univ Mainz, Inst Physiol & Pathophysiol, D-55128 Mainz, Germany","Luhmann, HJ (reprint author), Univ Mainz, Inst Physiol & Pathophysiol, Duesbergweg 6, D-55128 Mainz, Germany.",luhmann@uni-mainz.de,"Kilb, Werner/F-6675-2010",,,,,30,172,173,0,11,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,5-Jan,2006,439,7072,,,,,79,83,,10.1038/nature04264,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,999HA,WOS:000234378700038,16327778,No,,,11/20/17

Interest in MaSCs has been further stimulated by their potential role in breast tumorigenesis(4). However, the identity and purification of MaSCs has proved elusive owing to the lack of defined markers. We isolated discrete populations of mouse mammary cells on the basis of cell-surface markers and identified a subpopulation (Lin(-) CD29(hi) CD24(+)) that is highly enriched for MaSCs by transplantation. Here we show that a single cell, marked with a LacZ transgene, can reconstitute a complete mammary gland in vivo. The transplanted cell contributed to both the luminal and myoepithelial lineages and generated functional lobuloalveolar units during pregnancy. The self-renewing capacity of these cells was demonstrated by serial transplantation of clonal outgrowths. In support of a potential role for MaSCs in breast cancer, the stem-cell-enriched subpopulation was expanded in premalignant mammary tissue from MMTV-wnt-1 mice and contained a higher number of MaSCs.

A microbicide to prevent sexual transmission of HSV-2 would contribute substantially to controlling the spread of HIV and other infections(3,4). Because RNA interference (RNAi) provides effective antiviral defence in plants and other organisms, several studies have focused on harnessing RNAi to inhibit viral infection(5). Here we show that vaginal instillation of small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) targeting HSV-2 protects mice from lethal infection. siRNAs mixed with lipid are efficiently taken up by epithelial and lamina propria cells and silence gene expression in the mouse vagina and ectocervix for at least nine days. Intravaginal application of siRNAs targeting the HSV-2 UL27 and UL29 genes ( which encode an envelope glycoprotein and a DNA binding protein(6), respectively) was well tolerated, did not induce interferon-responsive genes or cause inflammation, and protected mice when administered before and/or after lethal HSV-2 challenge.

Genetic alterations occur frequently in the most aggressive neuroblastomas(1). In particular, deletion or suppression of the proapoptotic enzyme caspase-8 is common in malignant, disseminated disease, although the effect of this loss on disease progression is unclear(2-4). Here we show that suppression of caspase-8 expression occurs during the establishment of neuroblastoma metastases in vivo, and that reconstitution of caspase-8 expression in deficient neuroblastoma cells suppressed their metastases. Caspase-8 status was not a predictor of primary tumour growth; rather, caspase-8 selectively potentiated apoptosis in neuroblastoma cells invading the collagenous stroma at the tumour margin. Apoptosis was initiated by unligated integrins by means of a process known as integrin-mediated death(5). Loss of caspase-8 or integrin rendered these cells refractory to integrin-mediated death, allowed cellular survival in the stromal microenvironment, and promoted metastases. These findings define caspase-8 as a metastasis suppressor gene that, together with integrins, regulates the survival and invasive capacity of neuroblastoma cells.","Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Pathol, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; Univ Calif San Diego, John & Rebecca Moores Canc Ctr, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; St Jude Childrens Hosp, Dept Genet & Tumor Cell Biol, Memphis, TN 38105 USA; St Jude Childrens Hosp, Dept Mol Pharmacol, Memphis, TN 38105 USA","Stupack, DG (reprint author), Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Pathol, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.",dstupack@ucsd.edu; jill.lahti@stjude.org,,,,,,30,178,182,0,4,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,5-Jan,2006,439,7072,,,,,95,99,,10.1038/nature04323,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,999HA,WOS:000234378700041,16397500,No,,,11/20/17

The directionality of supercoiling is ensured by chiral wrapping of the DNA(4,5) around a specialized domain(6-9) of the enzyme before strand passage. Here we observe the activity of gyrase in real time by tracking the rotation of a submicrometre bead attached to the side of a stretched DNA molecule(10). In the presence of gyrase and ATP, we observe bursts of rotation corresponding to the processive, stepwise introduction of negative supercoils in strict multiples of two(11). Changes in DNA tension have no detectable effect on supercoiling velocity, but the enzyme becomes markedly less processive as tension is increased over a range of only a few tenths of piconewtons. This behaviour is quantitatively explained by a simple mechanochemical model in which processivity depends on a kinetic competition between dissociation and rapid, tension-sensitive DNA wrapping. In a high-resolution variant of our assay, we directly detect rotational pauses corresponding to two kinetic substeps: an ATP-independent step at the end of the reaction cycle, and an ATP-binding step in the middle of the cycle, subsequent to DNA wrapping.","Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mol & Cell Biol, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Phys, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; Lawrence Berkeley Lab, Phys Biosci Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; Howard Hughes Med Inst, Berkeley, CA USA","Bustamante, C (reprint author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mol & Cell Biol, 229 Stanley Hall, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",ncozzare@berkeley.edu; carlos@alice.berkeley.edu,,"Bustamante, Carlos/0000-0002-2970-0073","NIGMS NIH HHS [R37 GM032543, R01 GM071552]",,,29,120,122,1,28,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,5-Jan,2006,439,7072,,,,,100,104,,10.1038/nature04319,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,999HA,WOS:000234378700042,16397501,No,,,11/20/17

Observing individual mechanistic cycles of these motor proteins is central to understanding their cellular functions. Here we follow in real time, at a resolution of two base pairs and 20 ms, the RNA translocation and unwinding cycles of a hepatitis C virus helicase (NS3) monomer. NS3 is a representative superfamily-2 helicase essential for viral replication(3), and therefore a potentially important drug target(4). We show that the cyclic movement of NS3 is coordinated by ATP in discrete steps of 11 +/- 3 base pairs, and that actual unwinding occurs in rapid smaller substeps of 3.6 +/- 1.3 base pairs, also triggered by ATP binding, indicating that NS3 might move like an inchworm(5,6).

Here we show that HP1 alpha, -beta, and -gamma are released from chromatin during the M phase of the cell cycle, even though tri-methylation levels of histone H3 lysine 9 remain unchanged. However, the additional, transient modification of histone H3 by phosphorylation of serine 10 next to the more stable methyl-lysine 9 mark is sufficient to eject HP1 proteins from their binding sites. Inhibition or depletion of the mitotic kinase Aurora B, which phosphorylates serine 10 on histone H3, causes retention of HP1 proteins on mitotic chromosomes, suggesting that H3 serine 10 phosphorylation is necessary for the dissociation of HP1 from chromatin in M phase. These findings establish a regulatory mechanism of protein - protein interactions, through a combinatorial readout of two adjacent post-translational modifications: a stable methylation and a dynamic phosphorylation mark.","Rockefeller Univ, Lab Chromatin Biol, New York, NY 10021 USA; Rockefeller Univ, Lab Chromosome & Cell Biol, New York, NY 10021 USA; Univ Virginia, Dept Chem, Charlottesville, VA 22904 USA; Univ Virginia, Dept Pathol, Charlottesville, VA 22904 USA","Fischle, W (reprint author), Rockefeller Univ, Lab Chromatin Biol, 1230 York Ave, New York, NY 10021 USA.",fischlw@rockefeller.edu; funabih@rockefeller.edu,"Hunt, Donald/I-6936-2012","Hunt, Donald/0000-0003-2815-6368; Tseng, Boo Shan/0000-0001-7563-0232; Funabiki, Hironori/0000-0003-4831-4087; Ueberheide, Beatrix/0000-0003-2512-0204",NIGMS NIH HHS [T32 GM066699],,,47,549,567,3,42,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,22-Dec,2005,438,7071,,,,,1116,1122,,10.1038/nature04219,,7,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,995OF,WOS:000234111500041,16222246,No,,,11/20/17

Remarkable iron-rich spherules were ascribed to later groundwater alteration, and the inferred abundance of water reinforced optimism that Mars was once habitable. The layered structures, however, are not unique to water deposition, and the scenario encounters difficulties in accounting for highly soluble salts admixed with less soluble salts, the lack of clay minerals from acid - rock reactions, high sphericity and near- uniform sizes of the spherules and the absence of a basin boundary. Here we present a simple alternative explanation involving deposition from a ground-hugging turbulent flow of rock fragments, salts, sulphides, brines and ice produced by meteorite impact. Subsequent weathering by intergranular water films can account for all of the features observed without invoking shallow seas, lakes or near- surface aquifers. Layered sequences observed elsewhere on heavily cratered Mars and attributed to wind, water or volcanism may well have formed similarly. If so, the search for past life on Mars should be reassessed accordingly.","Arizona State Univ, Dept Geol Sci, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA; Los Alamos Natl Lab, Los Alamos, NM 87545 USA","Knauth, LP (reprint author), Arizona State Univ, Dept Geol Sci, Box 871404, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA.",Knauth@asu.edu,,,,,,50,90,90,1,19,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,22-Dec,2005,438,7071,,,,,1123,1128,,10.1038/nature04383,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,995OF,WOS:000234111500042,16372001,No,,,11/20/17

On the basis of morphological observations as well as high abundances of haematite and sulphate minerals, the rocks have been interpreted as sediments that were deposited in a shallow body of briny water with subsequent evaporation leaving behind the sulphate minerals(1,2). The iron-sulphur mineralization at Meridiani has also been inferred to be analogous to that produced during oxidative weathering of metal sulphide minerals, such as occurs at acid mine drainage sites(7). Neither of these interpretations, however, is consistent with the chemical composition of the rocks. Here we propose an alternative model for diagenesis of Meridiani bedrock that involves deposition of volcanic ash followed by reaction with condensed sulphur dioxide- and water-bearing vapours emitted from fumaroles. This scenario does not require prolonged interaction with a standing body of surface water and may have occurred at high temperatures. Consequently, the model invokes an environment considerably less favourable for biological activity on Mars than previously proposed interpretations.","Univ Colorado, Ctr Astrobiol, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; Univ Colorado, Atmospher & Space Phys Lab, Boulder, CO 80309 USA","McCollom, TM (reprint author), Univ Colorado, Ctr Astrobiol, Campus Box 392, Boulder, CO 80309 USA.",mccollom@lasp.colorado.edu,,,,,,28,91,91,1,16,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,22-Dec,2005,438,7071,,,,,1129,1131,,10.1038/nature04390,,3,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,995OF,WOS:000234111500043,16372002,No,,,11/20/17

Although echoes have been discovered around some nearby extragalactic supernovae(7-13), targeted searches have not found any echoes in the regions of historical Galactic supernovae(14-16). Here we report three faint variable-surface-brightness complexes with high apparent proper motions pointing back to three of the six smallest ( and probably youngest) previously catalogued supernova remnants in the Large Magellanic Cloud, which are believed to have been thermonuclear ( type Ia) supernovae(17).

This movement is hampered by scattering with other electrons, as well as with impurities or thermal excitations (phonons). Experimentally, the scattering processes of single electrons are not observed, but rather the overall response of all mobile charge carriers within a sample. The ensemble dynamics can be described by the relaxation rates, which express how fast the system approaches equilibrium after an external perturbation(1-3). Here we measure the frequency-dependent microwave conductivity of the heavy-fermion metal UPd2Al3 ( ref. 4), finding that it is accurately described by the prediction for a single relaxation rate ( the so-called Drude response(5)). This is notable, as UPd2Al3 has strong interactions among the electrons(4) that might be expected to lead to more complex behaviour. Furthermore, the relaxation rate of just a few gigahertz is extremely low - this is several orders of magnitude below those of conventional metals ( which are typically around 10 THz), and at least one order of magnitude lower than previous estimates for comparable metals. These observations are directly related to the high effective mass of the charge carriers in this material and reveal the dynamics of interacting electrons.","Johannes Gutenberg Univ Mainz, Inst Phys, D-55099 Mainz, Germany; Univ Stuttgart, Inst Phys, D-70550 Stuttgart, Germany","Scheffler, M (reprint author), Univ Stuttgart, Inst Phys, D-70550 Stuttgart, Germany.",scheffl@pi1.physik.uni-stuttgart.de,"Dressel, Martin/D-3244-2012; Jourdan, Martin/D-8506-2016",,,,,25,56,56,1,15,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,22-Dec,2005,438,7071,,,,,1135,1137,,10.1038/nature04232,,3,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,995OF,WOS:000234111500045,16372004,No,,,11/20/17

Additional anthropogenic aerosols released into the atmosphere thus exert a direct radiative forcing on the climate system(1). The degree of present-day aerosol forcing is estimated from global models that incorporate a representation of the aerosol cycles(1-3). Although the models are compared and validated against observations, these estimates remain uncertain. Previous satellite measurements of the direct effect of aerosols contained limited information about aerosol type, and were confined to oceans only(4,5). Here we use state-of-the-art satellite-based measurements of aerosols(6-8) and surface wind speed(9) to estimate the clear-sky direct radiative forcing for 2002, incorporating measurements over land and ocean. We use a Monte Carlo approach to account for uncertainties in aerosol measurements and in the algorithm used. Probability density functions obtained for the direct radiative forcing at the top of the atmosphere give a clear-sky, global, annual average of -1.9 W m(-2) with standard deviation, +/-0.3 W m(-2). These results suggest that present-day direct radiative forcing is stronger than present model estimates, implying future atmospheric warming greater than is presently predicted, as aerosol emissions continue to decline(10).","Met Off, Exeter EX1 3PB, Devon, England; NOAA, Geophys Fluid Dynam Lab, Princeton, NJ 08540 USA","Bellouin, N (reprint author), Met Off, Exeter EX1 3PB, Devon, England.",nicolas.bellouin@metoffice.gov.uk,"Boucher, Olivier/J-5810-2012; Boucher, Olivier/K-7483-2012","Boucher, Olivier/0000-0003-2328-5769; Boucher, Olivier/0000-0003-2328-5769",,,,23,220,227,4,64,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,22-Dec,2005,438,7071,,,,,1138,1141,,10.1038/nature04348,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,995OF,WOS:000234111500046,16372005,No,,,11/20/17

Metadynamics trajectories identify plane sliding involving the formation of stacking faults as the most favourable pathway for the phase transition, and as a likely mechanism for plastic deformation of perovskite and post-perovskite. In particular, the predicted slip planes are {010} for perovskite ( consistent with experiment(10,11)) and {110} for postperovskite ( in contrast to the previously expected {010} slip planes(1-4)). Dominant slip planes define the lattice preferred orientation and elastic anisotropy of the texture.

This transformation involved not only the generation of morphological novelties ( digits, sacrum) but also a shift in locomotory dominance from the pectoral to the pelvic appendage(1). Despite its importance, the transformation from pelvic fin to hindlimb is the least studied and least well-documented part of this transformation, which is bracketed by the osteolepiform Eusthenopteron and the early tetrapods Ichthyostega and Acanthostega, but is not directly illuminated by any intermediate form. Panderichthys is the closest tetrapod relative currently represented by complete fossils(2), but its pelvic fin skeleton has not been described. Here, I present the only known articulated pelvic fin endoskeleton and associated partial pelvis of Panderichthys. The pelvic girdle is even less tetrapod-like than that of the osteolepiform Eusthenopteron(3), but the pelvic fin endoskeleton shares derived characteristics with basal tetrapods despite being more primitive than the pectoral fin of Panderichthys(4,5). The evolution of tetrapod locomotion appears to have passed through a stage of body-flexion propulsion, in which the pelvic fins played a relatively minor anchoring part, before the emergence of hindlimb-powered propulsion in the interval between Panderichthys and Acanthostega.","Uppsala Univ, Evolutionary Biol Ctr, Dept Physiol & Dev Biol, Subdept Evolutionary Organismal Biol, S-75236 Uppsala, Sweden","Boisvert, CA (reprint author), Uppsala Univ, Evolutionary Biol Ctr, Dept Physiol & Dev Biol, Subdept Evolutionary Organismal Biol, Norbyvagen 18A, S-75236 Uppsala, Sweden.",catherine.boisvert@ebc.uu.se,,,,,,14,46,49,1,50,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,22-Dec,2005,438,7071,,,,,1145,1147,,10.1038/nature04119,,3,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,995OF,WOS:000234111500048,16372007,No,,,11/20/17

One measure of quality in evolutionary studies is the degree of bodily symmetry ( fluctuating asymmetry, FA), because it measures developmental stability(7,8). Does dance quality reveal FA to the observer and is the effect stronger for male dancers than female? To answer these questions, we chose a population that has been measured twice for FA since 1996 (ref. 9) in a society ( Jamaican) in which dancing is important in the lives of both sexes. Motion-capture cameras created controlled stimuli ( in the form of videos) that isolated dance movements from all other aspects of visual appearance ( including FA), and the same population evaluated these videos for dancing ability. Here we report that there are strong positive associations between symmetry and dancing ability, and these associations were stronger in men than in women.

Its conidia production is prolific, and so human respiratory tract exposure is almost constant(4). A. fumigatus is isolated from human habitats(5) and vegetable compost heaps(6,7). In immunocompromised individuals, the incidence of invasive infection can be as high as 50% and the mortality rate is often about 50% (ref. 2). The interaction of A. fumigatus and other airborne fungi with the immune system is increasingly linked to severe asthma and sinusitis(8). Although the burden of invasive disease caused by A. fumigatus is substantial, the basic biology of the organism is mostly obscure. Here we show the complete 29.4-megabase genome sequence of the clinical isolate Af293, which consists of eight chromosomes containing 9,926 predicted genes. Microarray analysis revealed temperature-dependent expression of distinct sets of genes, as well as 700 A. fumigatus genes not present or significantly diverged in the closely related sexual species Neosartorya fischeri, many of which may have roles in the pathogenicity phenotype.

Although both A. oryzae and Aspergillus flavus belong to the section Flavi of the subgenus Circumdati of Aspergillus, A. oryzae, unlike A. flavus, does not produce aflatoxin, and its long history of use in the food industry has proved its safety. Here we show that the 37-megabase (Mb) genome of A. oryzae contains 12,074 genes and is expanded by 7 - 9 Mb in comparison with the genomes of Aspergillus nidulans(5) and Aspergillus fumigatus(6). Comparison of the three aspergilli species revealed the presence of syntenic blocks and A. oryzae-specific blocks ( lacking synteny with A. nidulans and A. fumigatus) in a mosaic manner throughout the genome of A. oryzae. The blocks of A. oryzae-specific sequence are enriched for genes involved in metabolism, particularly those for the synthesis of secondary metabolites. Specific expansion of genes for secretory hydrolytic enzymes, amino acid metabolism and amino acid/sugar uptake transporters supports the idea that A. oryzae is an ideal microorganism for fermentation.","Natl Inst Adv Ind Sci & Technol AIST, Inst Biol Resources & Funct, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058566, Japan; AIST, Computat Biol Res Ctr, Koto Ku, Tokyo 1350064, Japan; Natl Inst Technol & Evaluat, Shibuya Ku, Tokyo 1510066, Japan; Natl Food Res Inst, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058642, Japan; Natl Res Inst Brewing, Hiroshima 7390046, Japan; Tohoku Univ, Aoba Ku, Sendai, Miyagi 9818555, Japan; Univ Tokyo, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo 1138657, Japan; Nagoya Univ, Chikusa Ku, Nagoya, Aichi 4648601, Japan; Tokyo Univ Agr & Technol, Tokyo 1830054, Japan; Univ Manchester, Manchester M23 9PL, Lancs, England; MIT, Broad Inst, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; Inst Genom Res, Rockville, MD 20850 USA; George Washington Univ, Sch Med, Dept Biochem & Mol Biol, Washington, DC 20037 USA; ARS, USDA, So Reg Res Ctr, New Orleans, LA 70124 USA; Univ Nottingham, Sch Biol, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England; Tulane Univ, New Orleans, LA 70118 USA; Kyowa Hakko Kogyo Co Ltd, Chiyoda Ku, Tokyo 1008185, Japan; Gekkeikan Sake Co Ltd, Res Inst, Fushimi Ku, Kyoto 6128361, Japan; Amano Enzyme Inc, Gifu 5090108, Japan; INTEC Web & Genome Informat Corp, Koto Ku, Tokyo 1368637, Japan; Kikkoman Foods Inc, Chiba 2780037, Japan; Ozeki Co Ltd, Nishinomiya, Hyogo 6638227, Japan; Axiohelix, Koto Ku, Tokyo 1350064, Japan; Higeta Shoyu Ltd, Chiba 2888680, Japan; Kyushu Univ, Higashi Ku, Fukuoka 8128581, Japan; Nara Inst Sci & Technol, Nara 6300101, Japan","Machida, M (reprint author), Natl Inst Adv Ind Sci & Technol AIST, Inst Biol Resources & Funct, Higashi 1-1-1, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058566, Japan.",m.machida@aist.go.jp,"; Juvvadi, Praveen/G-9380-2012; Paulsen, Ian/K-3832-2012; Ogasawara, Naotake/B-7971-2011; Yamagata, Youhei/H-6602-2013; TAKEUCHI, Michio/H-6592-2013; Kobayashi, Tetsuo/I-6901-2014; U-ID, Kyushu/C-5291-2016; Abrams, Natalie/F-4845-2011","KATO, Masashi/0000-0002-8951-3640; Denning, David/0000-0001-5626-2251; Galagan, James/0000-0003-0542-3291; Juvvadi, Praveen/0000-0002-5112-7824; Paulsen, Ian/0000-0001-9015-9418; Kobayashi, Tetsuo/0000-0002-4008-454X; Abrams, Natalie/0000-0001-9698-2819; Wortman, Jennifer/0000-0002-8713-1227",Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council [CFB17726],,,28,642,1215,7,152,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,22-Dec,2005,438,7071,,,,,1157,1161,,10.1038/nature04300,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,995OF,WOS:000234111500051,16372010,No,,,11/20/17

Unlike neurons(5), white matter oligodendrocytes reportedly lack NMDA (N-methyl-D- aspartate) receptors(6,7). It is believed that glutamate damages oligodendrocytes, especially their precursor cells, by acting on calcium-permeable AMPA (alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl- 4-isoxazole propionic acid)/kainate receptors alone(1-4) or by reversing cystine - glutamate exchange and depriving cells of antioxidant protection(8). Here we show that precursor, immature and mature oligodendrocytes in the white matter of the cerebellum and corpus callosum exhibit NMDA-evoked currents, mediated by receptors that are blocked only weakly by Mg(2+) and that may contain NR1, NR2C and NR3 NMDA receptor subunits. NMDA receptors are present in the myelinating processes of oligodendrocytes, where the small intracellular space could lead to a large rise in intracellular ion concentration in response to NMDA receptor activation. Simulating ischaemia led to development of an inward current in oligodendrocytes, which was partly mediated by NMDA receptors. These results point to NMDA receptors of unusual subunit composition as a potential therapeutic target for preventing white matter damage in a variety of diseases.","UCL, Dept Physiol, London WC1E 6BT, England; Univ Oslo, Dept Anat, N-0317 Oslo, Norway; Univ Oslo, Ctr Mol Biol & Neurosci, N-0317 Oslo, Norway","Attwell, D (reprint author), UCL, Dept Physiol, Gower St, London WC1E 6BT, England.",D.Attwell@ucl.ac.uk,,"Karadottir, Ragnhildur Thora/0000-0001-9675-2722; Bergersen, Linda Hildegard /0000-0002-9964-9744","Wellcome Trust [, 017948, 065424, 075232]",,,28,389,403,2,28,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,22-Dec,2005,438,7071,,,,,1162,1166,,10.1038/nature04302,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,995OF,WOS:000234111500052,16372011,No,,,11/20/17

Here we show NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) receptor subunit expression on oligodendrocyte processes, and the presence of NMDA receptor subunit messenger RNA in isolated white matter. NR1, NR2A, NR2B, NR2C, NR2D and NR3A subunits showed clustered expression in cell processes, but NR3B was absent. During modelled ischaemia, NMDA receptor activation resulted in rapid Ca2+-dependent detachment and disintegration of oligodendroglial processes in the white matter of mice expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP) specifically in oligodendrocytes (CNP-GFP mice). This effect occurred at mouse ages corresponding to both the initiation and the conclusion of myelination. NR1 subunits were found mainly in oligodendrocyte processes, whereas AMPA (alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid)/kainate receptor subunits were mainly found in the somata. Consistent with this observation, injury to the somata was prevented by blocking AMPA/kainate receptors, and preventing injury to oligodendroglial processes required the blocking of NMDA receptors. The presence of NMDA receptors in oligodendrocyte processes explains why previous studies that have focused on the somata have not detected a role for NMDA receptors in oligodendrocyte injury. These NMDA receptors bestow a high sensitivity to acute injury and represent an important new target for drug development in a variety of brain disorders.","Univ Leicester, Dept Cell Physiol & Pharmacol, Leicester LE1 9HN, Leics, England","Fern, R (reprint author), Univ Leicester, Dept Cell Physiol & Pharmacol, Leicester LE1 9HN, Leics, England.",rf34@le.ac.uk,,"fern, robert/0000-0002-0625-3434",,,,28,318,332,0,20,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,22-Dec,2005,438,7071,,,,,1167,1171,,10.1038/nature04301,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,995OF,WOS:000234111500053,16372012,No,,,11/20/17

In Arabidopsis thaliana, stem cell fate in the shoot apical meristem is controlled by a regulatory network that includes the CLAVATA (CLV) ligand - receptor system and the homeodomain protein WUSCHEL (WUS)(1,2). Phytohormones such as auxin and cytokinin are also important for meristem regulation(3). Here we show a mechanistic link between the CLV/WUS network and hormonal control. WUS, a positive regulator of stem cells, directly represses the transcription of several two-component ARABIDOPSIS RESPONSE REGULATOR genes (ARR5, ARR6, ARR7 and ARR15), which act in the negative-feedback loop of cytokinin signalling(4,5). These data indicate that ARR genes might negatively influence meristem size and that their repression by WUS might be necessary for proper meristem function. Consistent with this hypothesis is our observation that a mutant ARR7 allele, which mimics the active, phosphorylated form, causes the formation of aberrant shoot apical meristems. Conversely, a loss-of-function mutation in a maize ARR homologue was recently shown to cause enlarged meristems(6).","Ag Lohmann, Max Planck Inst Dev Biol, D-72076 Tubingen, Germany; Univ N Carolina, Dept Biol, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA","Lohmann, JU (reprint author), Ag Lohmann, Max Planck Inst Dev Biol, D-72076 Tubingen, Germany.",jlohmann@tuebingen.mpg.de,"Busch, Wolfgang/B-8593-2008","Busch, Wolfgang/0000-0003-2042-7290; To, Jennifer/0000-0001-6149-9835; Lohmann, Jan/0000-0003-3667-187X",NIGMS NIH HHS [R01 GM064425-04],,,30,403,449,1,96,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,22-Dec,2005,438,7071,,,,,1172,1175,,10.1038/nature04270,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,995OF,WOS:000234111500054,16372013,No,,,11/20/17

During mitosis, H3 is also phosphorylated by the kinase Aurora B-7. Although H3 phosphorylation is a hallmark of mitosis, its function remains mysterious. It has been proposed that histone phosphorylation controls the binding of proteins to chromatin(8), but any such mechanisms are unknown. Here we show that antibodies against mitotic chromosomal antigens that are associated with human autoimmune diseases(9) specifically recognize H3 molecules that are modified by both tri-methylation of lysine 9 and phosphorylation of serine 10 ( H3K9me3S10ph). The generation of H3K9me3S10ph depends on Suv39h and Aurora B, and occurs at pericentric heterochromatin during mitosis in different eukaryotes. Most HP1 typically dissociates from chromosomes during mitosis(10-12), but if phosphorylation of H3 serine 10 is inhibited, HP1 remains chromosome-bound throughout mitosis. H3 phosphorylation by Aurora B is therefore part of a 'methyl/ phos switch' mechanism(8) that displaces HP1 and perhaps other proteins from mitotic heterochromatin.","Res Inst Mol Pathol, A-1030 Vienna, Austria; Monash Univ, Dept Immunol, Prahran, Vic 3181, Australia","Peters, JM (reprint author), Res Inst Mol Pathol, Dr Bohrgasse 7, A-1030 Vienna, Austria.",peters@imp.univie.ac.at,,,,,,30,395,409,2,9,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,22-Dec,2005,438,7071,,,,,1176,1180,,10.1038/nature04254,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,995OF,WOS:000234111500055,16222244,No,,,11/20/17

CHD ( for chromo-ATPase/helicase-DNA-binding) proteins regulate ATP-dependent nucleosome assembly and mobilization through their conserved double chromodomains and SWI2/SNF2 helicase/ ATPase domain(3-5). The Drosophila CHD1 localizes to the interbands and puffs of the polytene chromosomes, which are classic sites of transcriptional activity(6). Other CHD isoforms (CHD3/4 or Mi-2) are important for nucleosome remodelling in histone deacetylase complexes(7,8). Deletion of chromodomains impairs nucleosome binding and remodelling by CHD proteins(4). Here we describe the structure of the tandem arrangement of the human CHD1 chromodomains, and its interactions with histone tails. Unlike HP1 and Polycomb proteins that use single chromodomains to bind to their respective methylated histone H3 tails, the two chromodomains of CHD1 cooperate to interact with one methylated H3 tail. We show that the human CHD1 double chromodomains target the lysine 4-methylated histone H3 tail (H3K4me), a hallmark of active chromatin(9). Methylammonium recognition involves two aromatic residues, not the three-residue aromatic cage used by chromodomains of HP1 and Polycomb proteins(10-13). Furthermore, unique inserts within chromodomain 1 of CHD1 block the expected site of H3 tail binding seen in HP1 and Polycomb, instead directing H3 binding to a groove at the inter-chromodomain junction.","Univ Virginia Hlth Syst, Dept Biochem & Mol Genet, Charlottesville, VA 22908 USA; Univ Virginia Hlth Syst, Dept Pharmacol, Charlottesville, VA 22908 USA; Univ Virginia Hlth Syst, Dept Mol Physiol & Biol Phys, Charlottesville, VA 22908 USA; Argonne Natl Lab, Biosci Div, Struct Biol Ctr, Argonne, IL 60439 USA","Khorasanizadeh, S (reprint author), Univ Virginia Hlth Syst, Dept Biochem & Mol Genet, Charlottesville, VA 22908 USA.",fr9c@virginia.edu; khorasan@virginia.edu,"Chruszcz, Maksymilian/E-6407-2011; Minor, Wladek/F-3096-2014; Mi, Li-Zhi/B-1371-2016","Mi, Li-Zhi/0000-0001-9907-5245; Chruszcz, Maksymilian/0000-0001-7521-5485; Minor, Wladek/0000-0001-7075-7090",,,,28,325,333,1,24,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,22-Dec,2005,438,7071,,,,,1181,1185,,10.1038/nature04290,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,995OF,WOS:000234111500056,16372014,No,,,11/20/17

We can detect individual proton binding - unbinding reactions electrophysiologically at the level of a single proton on a single side chain as brief blocking - unblocking events of the passing cation current. Kinetic analysis of these fluctuations yields the position-dependent rates of proton transfer, from which the corresponding pK(a) values and shifts in pK(a) can be calculated. Here we present a self-consistent, residue-by-residue description of the microenvironment around the pore-lining transmembrane alpha-helices (M2) in the open-channel conformation, in terms of the excess free energy that is required to keep the engineered basic side chains protonated relative to bulk water.

While theoretical arguments(4) suggest that short GRBs are produced in the coalescence of binary compact objects ( neutron stars or black holes), the progenitors, energetics and environments of these events remain elusive despite recent(5-8) localizations. Here we report the discovery of the first radio afterglow from the short burst GRB 050724, which unambiguously associates it with an elliptical galaxy at a redshift(9) z = 0.257. We show that the burst is powered by the same relativistic fireball mechanism as long GRBs, with the ejecta possibly collimated in jets, but that the total energy release is 10 - 1,000 times smaller. More importantly, the nature of the host galaxy demonstrates that short GRBs arise from an old (> 1 Gyr) stellar population, strengthening earlier suggestions(5,6) and providing support for coalescing compact object binaries as the progenitors.","Carnegie Inst Washington Observ, Pasadena, CA 91101 USA; Univ Hawaii, Inst Astron, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; CALTECH, Caltech Opt Observ 105 24, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA; Natl Radio Astron Observ, Socorro, NM 87801 USA; Observ Carnegie Inst Washington, Observ Las Campanas, La Serena, Chile; Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Racah Inst Phys, IL-91904 Jerusalem, Israel; Univ Toronto, Dept Astron & Astrophys, Toronto, ON M5S 3H8, Canada; Gemini Observ, Hilo, HI 96720 USA; Australian Natl Univ, Mt Stromlo Observ, RSAA, Weston, ACT 2611, Australia; Pomona Coll, Dept Phys & Astron, Claremont, CA 91711 USA","Berger, E (reprint author), Carnegie Inst Washington Observ, 813 Santa Barbara St, Pasadena, CA 91101 USA.",eberger@ociw.edu,,,,,,29,269,271,1,8,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,15-Dec,2005,438,7070,,,,,988,990,,10.1038/nature04238,,3,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,993EC,WOS:000233934600059,16355217,No,,,11/20/17

Long bursts, which on average have softer gamma-ray spectra(2), are known to be associated with stellar core-collapse events - in some cases simultaneously producing powerful type Ic supernovae(3-5). In contrast, the origin of short bursts has remained mysterious until recently. A subsecond intense 'spike' of gamma-rays during a giant flare from the Galactic soft gamma-ray repeater, SGR 1806 - 20, reopened an old debate over whether some short GRBs could be similar events seen in galaxies out to similar to 70 Mpc (refs 6 - 10; redshift z approximate to 0.016). Shortly after that, localizations of a few short GRBs ( with optical afterglows detected in two cases(11,12)) have shown an apparent association with a variety of host galaxies at moderate redshifts(11-14).

The combination of these two results left unclear the nature of the host galaxies of the bursts, because one was a star-forming dwarf, while the other was probably an elliptical galaxy. Here we report the X-ray localization of a short burst (GRB 050724) with unusual gamma-ray and X-ray properties. The X-ray afterglow lies off the centre of an elliptical galaxy at a redshift of z = 0.258 (ref. 5), coincident with the position determined by ground-based optical and radio observations(6-8). The low level of star formation typical for elliptical galaxies makes it unlikely that the burst originated in a supernova explosion. A supernova origin was also ruled out for GRB 050709 ( refs 3, 31), even though that burst took place in a galaxy with current star formation. The isotropic energy for the short bursts is 2 - 3 orders of magnitude lower than that for the long bursts.

The transition from reversible to irreversible behaviour is fundamental to statistical physics, but has not been observed experimentally in many-body systems. The flow of a newtonian fluid at low Reynolds number can be reversible: for example, if the fluid between concentric cylinders is sheared by boundary motion that is subsequently reversed, then all fluid elements return to their starting positions(4). Similarly, slowly sheared suspensions of solid particles, which occur widely in nature and science(5), are governed by time reversible equations of motion. Here we report an experiment showing precisely how time reversibility(6) fails for slowly sheared suspensions. We find that there is a concentration dependent threshold for the deformation or strain beyond which particles do not return to their starting configurations after one or more cycles.

But the nature of the interactions between tectonic forces, climate and drainage evolution remains contested(5-7). Here we reconstruct the erosional discharge from the Indus river over the past 30 million years using seismic reflection data obtained from drill core samples from the Arabian Sea and neodymium isotope data. We find that the source of the Indus sediments was dominated by erosion within and north of the Indus suture zone until five million years ago; after that, the river began to receive more erosional products from Himalayan sources. We propose that this change in the erosional pattern is caused by a rerouting of the major rivers of the Punjab into the Indus, which flowed east into the Ganges river before that time. Seismic reflection profiles from the Indus fan suggest high mass accumulation rates during the Pleistocene epoch partly driven by increased drainage to the Indus river after five million years ago and partly by faster erosion linked to a stronger monsoon over the past four million years(1). Our isotope stratigraphy for the Indus fan provides strong evidence for a significant change in the geometry of western Himalayan river systems in the recent geologic past.","Univ Aberdeen, Dept Geol & Petr Geol, Aberdeen AB24 3UE, Scotland; Woods Hole Oceanog Inst, Dept Geol & Geophys, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA","Clift, PD (reprint author), Univ Aberdeen, Dept Geol & Petr Geol, Aberdeen AB24 3UE, Scotland.",p.clift@abdn.ac.uk,,,,,,27,71,75,3,32,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,15-Dec,2005,438,7070,,,,,1001,1003,,10.1038/nature04379,,3,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,993EC,WOS:000233934600063,16355221,No,,,11/20/17

This final possibility has been rejuvenated by recent evidence for a phase change in MgSiO3 perovskite ( thought to be the most prevalent phase in the lower mantle(2)) at near core - mantle boundary temperature and pressure conditions(3). Here we explore the efficacy of this 'post-perovskite' phase to explain the seismic properties of the lowermost mantle through coupled ab initio and seismic modelling of perovskite and post-perovskite polymorphs of MgSiO3, performed at lowermost-mantle temperatures and pressures.

Their cylindrical shape results from a polarized mechanism of cell expansion called tip growth in which elongation is restricted to a small area at the surface of the hair-forming cell (trichoblast) tip(2-4). Here we identify proteins that spatially control the sites at which cell growth occurs by isolating Arabidopsis mutants (scn1) that develop ectopic sites of growth on trichoblasts. We cloned SCN1 and showed that SCN1 is a RhoGTPase GDP dissociation inhibitor ( RhoGDI) that spatially restricts the sites of growth to a single point on the trichoblast. We showed previously that localized production of reactive oxygen species by RHD2/AtrbohC NADPH oxidase is required for hair growth(5); here we show that SCN1/AtrhoGDI1 is a component of the mechanism that focuses RHD2/AtrbohC-catalysed production of reactive oxygen species to hair tips during wild-type development.

Spinal microglia stimulated by ATP contribute to tactile allodynia, a highly debilitating symptom of pain induced by nerve injury(4). Signalling between microglia and neurons is therefore an essential link in neuropathic pain transmission, but how this signalling occurs is unknown. Here we show that ATP-stimulated microglia cause a depolarizing shift in the anion reversal potential (E-anion) in spinal lamina I neurons. This shift inverts the polarity of currents activated by GABA (gamma-amino butyric acid), as has been shown to occur after peripheral nerve injury(5). Applying brain-derived neurotrophic factor ( BDNF) mimics the alteration in Eanion. Blocking signalling between BDNF and the receptor TrkB reverses the allodynia and the E-anion shift that follows both nerve injury and administration of ATP-stimulated microglia. ATP stimulation evokes the release of BDNF from microglia. Preventing BDNF release from microglia by pretreating them with interfering RNA directed against BDNF before ATP stimulation also inhibits the effects of these cells on the withdrawal threshold and E-anion. Our results show that ATP-stimulated microglia signal to lamina I neurons, causing a collapse of their transmembrane anion gradient, and that BDNF is a crucial signalling molecule between microglia and neurons. Blocking this microglia-neuron signalling pathway may represent a therapeutic strategy for treating neuropathic pain.","Univ Laval, Ctr Rech, Div Neurobiol Cellulaire, Quebec City, PQ G1J 2G3, Canada; McGill Univ, Dept Pharmacol & Therapeut, Montreal, PQ H3G 1Y6, Canada; Hosp Sick Children, Programme Brain & Behav, Toronto, ON M5G 1X8, Canada; Kyushu Univ, Grad Sch Pharmaceut Sci, Dept Mol & Syst Pharmacol, Fukuoka 8128582, Japan; Univ Laval, Ctr Rech, Div Neurobiol Syst, Quebec City, PQ G1J 2G3, Canada; Univ Laval, Dept Psychiat, Quebec City, PQ G1K 7P4, Canada","De Koninck, Y (reprint author), Univ Laval, Ctr Rech, Div Neurobiol Cellulaire, Quebec City, PQ G1J 2G3, Canada.",mike.salter@utoronto.ca; Yves.DeKoninck@crulrg.ulaval.ca,"Boudreau, Dominic/I-8144-2012; De Koninck, Yves/C-2659-2008","De Koninck, Yves/0000-0002-5779-9330",,,,29,884,937,7,79,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,15-Dec,2005,438,7070,,,,,1017,1021,,10.1038/nature04223,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,993EC,WOS:000233934600067,16355225,No,,,11/20/17

Activation of TRPM5 occurs downstream of the activation of G-protein-coupled taste receptors and is proposed to generate a depolarizing potential in the taste receptor cells(2). Factors that modulate TRPM5 activity are therefore expected to influence taste. Here we show that TRPM5 is a highly temperature-sensitive, heat-activated channel: inward TRPM5 currents increase steeply at temperatures between 15 and 35 degrees C. TRPM4, a close homologue of TRPM5, shows similar temperature sensitivity. Heat activation is due to a temperature-dependent shift of the activation curve, in analogy to other thermosensitive TRP channels(3). Moreover, we show that increasing temperature between 15 and 35 degrees C markedly enhances the gustatory nerve response to sweet compounds in wild-type but not in Trpm5 knockout mice. The strong temperature sensitivity of TRPM5 may underlie known effects of temperature on perceived taste in humans(4-6), including enhanced sweetness perception at high temperatures and 'thermal taste', the phenomenon whereby heating or cooling of the tongue evoke sensations of taste in the absence of tastants(7).","Catholic Univ Louvain, Fysiol Lab, B-3000 Louvain, Belgium; Kyushu Univ, Grad Sch Dent Sci, Sect Oral Neurosci, Higashi Ku, Fukuoka 8128582, Japan; Mt Sinai Sch Med, Dept Neurosci, New York, NY 10029 USA","Talavera, K (reprint author), Catholic Univ Louvain, Fysiol Lab, Campus Gasthuisberg, B-3000 Louvain, Belgium.",Karel.talavera@med.kuleuven.be,"Talavera, Karel/K-7990-2014; Voets, Thomas/E-2466-2012","Talavera, Karel/0000-0002-3124-138X; Voets, Thomas/0000-0001-5526-5821",,,,22,223,242,3,37,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,15-Dec,2005,438,7070,,,,,1022,1025,,10.1038/nature04248,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,993EC,WOS:000233934600068,16355226,No,,,11/20/17

Both hair and feather follicles show robust regenerative powers that episodically renew the epithelial organ. However, the evolution of feathers ( from reptiles to birds) and hairs ( from reptiles to mammals) are independent events and their follicular structures result from convergent evolution. Because feathers do not have the anatomical equivalent of a hair follicle bulge, we are interested in determining where their stem cells are localized. By applying long-term label retention(1), transplantation(2) and DiI tracing to map stem cell activities, here we show that feather follicles contain slow-cycling long-term label-retaining cells (LRCs), transient amplifying cells and differentiating keratinocytes. Each population, located in anatomically distinct regions, undergoes dynamic homeostasis during the feather cycle. In the growing follicle, LRCs are enriched in a 'collar bulge' niche. In the moulting follicle, LRCs shift to populate a papillar ectoderm niche near the dermal papilla. On transplantation, LRCs show multipotentiality. In a three-dimensional view, LRCs are configured as a ring that is horizontally placed in radially symmetric feathers but tilted in bilaterally symmetric feathers. The changing topology of stem cell activities may contribute to the construction of complex feather forms.","Univ So Calif, Dept Pathol, Keck Sch Med, Los Angeles, CA 90033 USA","Chuong, CM (reprint author), Univ So Calif, Dept Pathol, Keck Sch Med, Los Angeles, CA 90033 USA.",chuong@pathfinder.usc.edu,,"yue, zhicao/0000-0001-5729-3842","NIAMS NIH HHS [R01 AR042177-11, R01 AR042177, R01 AR042177-08, R01 AR042177-08S1, R01 AR042177-09, R01 AR042177-10, R01 AR047364, R01 AR047364-01A2, R01 AR047364-02, R01 AR047364-03, R01 AR047364-04]",,,29,71,74,0,15,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,15-Dec,2005,438,7070,,,,,1026,1029,,10.1038/nature04222,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,993EC,WOS:000233934600069,16355227,No,,,11/20/17

Removal of cells containing sqt transcripts from four-to-eight-cell embryos or injection of antisense morpholino oligonucleotides targeting sqt into oocytes can cause a loss of dorsal structures. Localization of sqt transcripts is independent of maternal Wnt pathway function and requires a highly conserved sequence in the 3' untranslated region. Thus, the dorsoventral axis is apparent by early cleavage stages and may require the maternally encoded morphogen Sqt and its associated factors. Because the 3' untranslated region of the human nodal gene can also localize exogenous sequences to dorsal cells, this mechanism may be evolutionarily conserved.","Temasek Life Sci Lab, Vertebrate Dev Grp, Singapore 117604, Singapore; Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Biol Sci, Singapore 117543, Singapore; Univ Penn, Dept Biol, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA","Sampath, K (reprint author), Temasek Life Sci Lab, Vertebrate Dev Grp, 1 Res Link, Singapore 117604, Singapore.",karuna@tll.org.sg,,,,,,30,78,81,0,7,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,15-Dec,2005,438,7070,,,,,1030,1035,,10.1038/nature04184,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,993EC,WOS:000233934600070,16355228,No,,,11/20/17

To prevent chromosome missegregation, APC activity directed against these mitotic regulators must be inhibited until all chromosomes are properly attached to the mitotic spindle(2). Here we show that in mitosis timely destruction of securin by APC is regulated by the nucleocytoplasmic transport factors Rae1 and Nup98. We show that combined Rae1 and Nup98 haploinsufficiency in mice results in premature separation of sister chromatids, severe aneuploidy and untimely degradation of securin. We find that Rae1 and Nup98 form a complex with Cdh1-activated APC (APC(Cdh1)) in early mitosis and specifically inhibit APC(Cdh1)-mediated ubiquitination of securin. Dissociation of Rae1 and Nup98 from APC(Cdh1) coincides with the release of the mitotic checkpoint protein BubR1 from Cdc20-activated APC (APC(Cdc20)) at the metaphase to anaphase transition.

Photosystem II captures sunlight and powers the unique photo-induced oxidation of water to atmospheric oxygen(1,2). Crystallographic investigations of cyanobacterial photosystem II have provided several medium-resolution structures (3.8 to 3.2 angstrom)(3-6) that explain the general arrangement of the protein matrix and cofactors, but do not give a full picture of the complex. Here we describe the most complete cyanobacterial photosystem II structure obtained so far, showing locations of and interactions between 20 protein subunits and 77 cofactors per monomer. Assignment of 11 beta-carotenes yields insights into electron and energy transfer and photoprotection mechanisms in the reaction centre and antenna subunits. The high number of 14 integrally bound lipids reflects the structural and functional importance of these molecules for flexibility within and assembly of photosystem II. A lipophilic pathway is proposed for the diffusion of secondary plastoquinone that transfers redox equivalents from photosystem II to the photosynthetic chain. The structure provides information about the Mn4Ca cluster, where oxidation of water takes place.

Here we report an overview of the Huygens mission, which enabled studies of the atmosphere and surface, including in situ sampling of the organic chemistry, and revealed an Earth-like landscape. The probe descended over the boundary between a bright icy terrain eroded by fluvial activity - probably due to methane - and a darker area that looked like a river- or lake-bed.

Recent measurements from the cameras aboard the Cassini orbiter fail to see a global reservoir, but the methane and smog in Titan's atmosphere impedes the search for hydrocarbons on the surface. Here we report spectra and high-resolution images obtained by the Huygens Probe Descent Imager/Spectral Radiometer instrument in Titan's atmosphere. Although these images do not show liquid hydrocarbon pools on the surface, they do reveal the traces of once flowing liquid. Surprisingly like Earth, the brighter highland regions show complex systems draining into flat, dark lowlands. Images taken after landing are of a dry riverbed. The infrared reflectance spectrum measured for the surface is unlike any other in the Solar System; there is a red slope in the optical range that is consistent with an organic material such as tholins, and absorption from water ice is seen. However, a blue slope in the near-infrared suggests another, unknown constituent. The number density of haze particles increases by a factor of just a few from an altitude of 150 km to the surface, with no clear space below the tropopause.

The Huygens probe, launched from the Cassini spacecraft, has made the first direct observations of the satellite's surface and lower atmosphere. Here we report direct atmospheric measurements from the Gas Chromatograph Mass Spectrometer (GCMS), including altitude profiles of the constituents, isotopic ratios and trace species ( including organic compounds). The primary constituents were confirmed to be nitrogen and methane. Noble gases other than argon were not detected. The argon includes primordial Ar-36, and the radiogenic isotope Ar-40, providing an important constraint on the outgassing history of Titan.

Here we report an in situ chemical analysis of Titan's aerosols by pyrolysis at 600 degrees C. Ammonia (NH3) and hydrogen cyanide (HCN) have been identified as the main pyrolysis products.

It was realized that the motion of an atmospheric probe could be used to study the winds, which led to the inclusion of the Doppler Wind Experiment(4) on the Huygens probe(5). Here we report a high resolution vertical profile of Titan's winds, with an estimated accuracy of better than 1 m s(-1). The zonal winds were prograde during most of the atmospheric descent, providing in situ confirmation of superrotation on Titan.

Here we demonstrate that bone marrow-derived haematopoietic progenitor cells that express vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 1 (VEGFR1; also known as Flt1) home to tumour-specific pre-metastatic sites and form cellular clusters before the arrival of tumour cells. Preventing VEGFR1 function using antibodies or by the removal of VEGFR1(+) cells from the bone marrow of wild-type mice abrogates the formation of these pre-metastatic clusters and prevents tumour metastasis, whereas reconstitution with selected Id3 ( inhibitor of differentiation 3)-competent VEGFR1(+) cells establishes cluster formation and tumour metastasis in Id3 knockout mice. We also show that VEGFR1(+) cells express VLA-4 ( also known as integrin alpha(4)beta(1)), and that tumour-specific growth factors upregulate fibronectin - a VLA-4 ligand - in resident fibroblasts, providing a permissive niche for incoming tumour cells. Conditioned media obtained from distinct tumour types with unique patterns of metastatic spread redirected fibronectin expression and cluster formation, thereby transforming the metastatic profile. These findings demonstrate a requirement for VEGFR1(+) haematopoietic progenitors in the regulation of metastasis, and suggest that expression patterns of fibronectin and VEGFR1(+)VLA-4(+) clusters dictate organ-specific tumour spread.","Cornell Univ, Weill Cornell Med Coll, Dept Pediat, New York, NY 10021 USA; Cornell Univ, Weill Cornell Med Coll, Childrens Blood Fdn Labs, New York, NY 10021 USA; Cornell Univ, Weill Cornell Med Coll, Howard Hughes Med Inst, New York, NY 10021 USA; Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Dept Pediat, New York, NY 10021 USA; Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Dept Surg, New York, NY 10021 USA; Imclone Syst Inc, New York, NY 10014 USA; Fox Chase Canc Ctr, Philadelphia, PA 19111 USA","Lyden, D (reprint author), Cornell Univ, Weill Cornell Med Coll, Dept Pediat, 1300 York Ave, New York, NY 10021 USA.",srafii@med.cornell.edu; dcl2001@med.cornell.edu,,"Costa, Carla/0000-0001-5977-6207","Howard Hughes Medical Institute; NHLBI NIH HHS [R01 HL058707, P01 HL067839, P01 HL067839-010004, P01 HL067839-020004, P01 HL067839-030004, P01 HL067839-040004, P01 HL067839-050004, R01 HL058707-03, R01 HL058707-04, R01 HL061849, R01 HL061849-02, R01 HL061849-03, R01 HL061849-03S1, R01 HL061849-04, R01 HL061849-05]",,,36,1522,1610,5,112,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,8-Dec,2005,438,7069,,,,,820,827,,10.1038/nature04186,,8,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,990XX,WOS:000233777800044,16341007,No,,,11/20/17

Implementations of quantum network operations are thus conditioned on the ability to realize matter-to-light and/or light-to-matter quantum state mappings. Here we report the generation, transmission, storage and retrieval of single quanta using two remote atomic ensembles. A single photon is generated from a cold atomic ensemble at one site 1, and is directed to another site through 100 metres of optical fibre. The photon is then converted into a single collective atomic excitation using a dark-state polariton approach(2). After a programmable storage time, the atomic excitation is converted back into a single photon. This is demonstrated experimentally, for a storage time of 0.5 microseconds, by measurement of an anti-correlation parameter. Storage times exceeding ten microseconds are observed by intensity cross-correlation measurements. This storage period is two orders of magnitude longer than the time required to achieve conversion between photonic and atomic quanta.

These techniques are important for the practical realization of quantum networks, in which multiple memory nodes that utilize atoms for generation, storage and processing of quantum states are connected by single-photon transmission in optical fibres(1,2). One promising avenue for the realization of quantum networks involves the manipulation of quantum pulses of light in optically dense atomic ensembles using electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT, refs 8, 9). EIT is a coherent control technique that is widely used for controlling the propagation of classical, multi-photon light pulses(10-14) in applications such as efficient nonlinear optics(15). Here we demonstrate the use of EIT for the controllable generation, transmission and storage of single photons with tunable frequency, timing and bandwidth. We study the interaction of single photons produced in a 'source' ensemble of Rb-87 atoms at room temperature with another 'target' ensemble. This allows us to simultaneously probe the spectral and quantum statistical properties of narrow-bandwidth single-photon pulses, revealing that their quantum nature is preserved under EIT propagation and storage. We measure the time delay associated with the reduced group velocity of the single-photon pulses and report observations of their storage and retrieval.","Harvard Univ, Dept Phys, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; Harvard Smithsonian Ctr Astrophys, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; Tech Univ Kaiserslautern, Fachbereich Phys, D-67663 Kaiserslautern, Germany; PN Lebedev Phys Inst, Moscow 117924, Russia","Eisaman, MD (reprint author), Harvard Univ, Dept Phys, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",eisaman@fas.harvard.edu,"Eisaman, Matthew/E-8006-2011; Fleischhauer, Michael/G-6716-2011; Zibrov, Alexander/G-7419-2014","Eisaman, Matthew/0000-0002-3814-6430; ",,,,30,485,499,10,76,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,8-Dec,2005,438,7069,,,,,837,841,,10.1038/nature04327,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,990XX,WOS:000233777800047,16341010,No,,,11/20/17

The Columbia River basalts (CRB) represent the largest volume of flood basalts associated with the Yellowstone hotspot, yet their source appears to be in the vicinity of the Wallowa Mountains(1), about 500 km north of the projected hotspot track. These mountains are composed of a large granitic pluton intruded into a region of oceanic lithosphere affinity(2). The elevation of the interface between Columbia River basalts and other geological formations indicates that mild pre-eruptive subsidence took place in the Wallowa Mountains, followed by syn-eruptive uplift of several hundred metres and a long-term uplift of about 2 km. The mapped surface uplift mimics regional topography, with the Wallowa Mountains in the centre of a 'bull's eye' pattern of valleys and low-elevation mountains. Here we present the seismic velocity structure of the mantle underlying this region and erosion-corrected elevation maps of lava flows, and show that an area of reduced mantle melt content coincides with the 200-km-wide topographic uplift. We conclude that convective downwelling and detachment of a compositionally dense plutonic root can explain the timing and magnitude of Columbia River basalt magmatism, as well as the surface uplift and existence of the observed melt-depleted mantle.","Univ Oregon, Dept Geol Sci, Eugene, OR 97403 USA","Hales, TC (reprint author), Univ Oregon, Dept Geol Sci, 1272 Univ Oregon, Eugene, OR 97403 USA.",thales@uoregon.edu,"Hales, TC/D-2769-2009","Hales, Tristram/0000-0002-3330-3302",,,,27,94,94,1,10,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,8-Dec,2005,438,7069,,,,,842,845,,10.1038/nature04313,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,990XX,WOS:000233777800048,16341011,No,,,11/20/17

In these biomes, which are characterized by the co-dominance of trees and grasses, woody cover is a chief determinant of ecosystem properties(1-3). The availability of resources ( water, nutrients) and disturbance regimes ( fire, herbivory) are thought to be important in regulating woody cover(1,2,4,5), but perceptions differ on which of these are the primary drivers of savanna structure. Here we show, using data from 854 sites across Africa, that maximum woody cover in savannas receiving a mean annual precipitation (MAP) of less than similar to 650 mm is constrained by, and increases linearly with, MAP. These arid and semi-arid savannas may be considered 'stable' systems in which water constrains woody cover and permits grasses to coexist, while fire, herbivory and soil properties interact to reduce woody cover below the MAP-controlled upper bound. Above a MAP of similar to 650 mm, savannas are 'unstable' systems in which MAP is sufficient for woody canopy closure, and disturbances ( fire, herbivory) are required for the coexistence of trees and grass. These results provide insights into the nature of African savannas and suggest that future changes in precipitation(6) may considerably affect their distribution and dynamics.","Colorado State Univ, Nat Resource Ecol Lab, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA; CSIR, Div Forest Sci & Technol, ZA-001 Pretoria, South Africa; Forest Serv, USDA, Commanche Natl Grassland, Springfield, CO 81073 USA; US Geol Survey, Ft Collins Sci Ctr, Ft Collins, CO 80526 USA; Univ Paris 06, CNRS, UMR 7625, Lab Ecol,Ecole Normale Super, F-75230 Paris, France; UFZ Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Sekt Okosyst Anal, D-04318 Leipzig, Germany; Univ Lyon 1, CNRS, UMR 5557,Microbial Ecol Lab, USC INRA 1193, F-69622 Villeurbanne, France; CSIRO Plant Ind, CSIRO Ctr Environm & Life Sci, Wembley, WA 6913, Australia; Lund Univ, Dept Phys Geog & Ecosyst Anal, S-22362 Lund, Sweden; Univ Dar Es Salaam, Dept Bot, Dar Es Salaam, Tanzania; Port Elizabeth Technikon, Dept Agr & Game Management, ZA-6000 Port Elizabeth, South Africa; Princeton Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; Ctr Suivi Ecol, Dakar, Senegal; Univ Nairobi, Dept Range Management, Nairobi, Kenya; Univ Virginia, Dept Environm Sci, Charlottesville, VA 22904 USA; Univ Cape Town, Dept Bot, ZA-7700 Rondebosch, South Africa; Univ Zimbabwe, Inst Environm Studies, Harare, Zimbabwe; CESBIO, F-31401 Toulouse, France; Univ Pretoria, Mammal Res Inst, ZA-002 Pretoria, South Africa; Univ Wisconsin, Dept Zool, Madison, WI 53706 USA; Univ Wageningen & Res Ctr, Resource Ecol Grp, NL-6708 PD Wageningen, Netherlands; Univ Botswana, Harry Oppenheimer Okavango Res Ctr, Maun, Botswana; Univ Potsdam, Inst Biochem & Biol Plant Ecol & Nat Conservat, D-14469 Potsdam, Germany; Kruger Natl Pk, Sci Serv, ZA-1350 Skukuza, South Africa","Sankaran, M (reprint author), Colorado State Univ, Nat Resource Ecol Lab, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA.",mahesh@nrel.colostate.edu,"Caylor, Kelly/B-7734-2008; Mitchard, Edward/C-6346-2009; Augustine, David/H-6167-2011; Higgins, Steven/A-5138-2012; Ludwig, Fulco/N-7732-2013; Noojipady, Praveen/B-2511-2010","Caylor, Kelly/0000-0002-6466-6448; Higgins, Steven/0000-0001-5695-9665; Sea, William/0000-0001-6631-6735; Hanan, Niall/0000-0002-9130-5306; Ardo, Jonas/0000-0002-9318-0973; Scholes, Robert/0000-0001-5537-6935",,,,30,742,764,34,361,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,8-Dec,2005,438,7069,,,,,846,849,,10.1038/nature04070,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,990XX,WOS:000233777800049,16341012,No,,,11/20/17

To test the hypothesis that dopamine is an essential mediator of various opiate-induced responses, we administered morphine to mice unable to synthesize dopamine. We found that dopamine-deficient mice are unable to mount a normal locomotor response to morphine, but a small dopamine-independent increase in locomotion remains. Dopamine-deficient mice have a rightward shift in the dose - response curve to morphine on the tail-flick test ( a pain sensitivity assay), suggesting either a decreased sensitivity to the analgesic effects of morphine and/or basal hyperalgesia. In contrast, dopamine-deficient mice display a robust conditioned place preference for morphine when given either caffeine or L-dihydroxyphenylalanine ( a dopamine precursor that restores dopamine throughout the brain) during the testing phases. Together, these data demonstrate that dopamine is a crucial component of morphine-induced locomotion, dopamine may contribute to morphine analgesia, but that dopamine is not required for morphine-induced reward as measured by conditioned place preference.","Univ Washington, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; Univ Washington, Dept Biochem, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; Univ Washington, Grad Program Neurobiol & Behav, Seattle, WA 98195 USA","Palmiter, RD (reprint author), Univ Washington, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.",palmiter@u.washington.edu,,,,,,29,125,136,1,21,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,8-Dec,2005,438,7069,,,,,854,857,,10.1038/nature04172,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,990XX,WOS:000233777800051,16341013,No,,,11/20/17

After lens removal, the pigment epithelial cells of the dorsal, but not the ventral, iris dedifferentiate and then differentiate to form a new lens. Understanding how this process is regulated might provide clues about why lens regeneration does not occur in higher vertebrates. The genes six-3 and pax-6 are known to induce ectopic lenses during embryogenesis(7,8). Here we tested these genes, as well as members of the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) pathway that regulate establishment of the dorsal ventral axis in embryos(9), for their ability to induce lens regeneration. We show that the lens can be regenerated from the ventral iris when the BMP pathway is inhibited and when the iris is transfected with six-3 and treated with retinoic acid. In intact irises, six-3 is expressed at higher levels in the ventral than in the dorsal iris. During regeneration, however, only expression in the dorsal iris is significantly increased. Such an increase is seen in ventral irises only when they are induced to transdifferentiate by six-3 and retinoic acid or by BMP inhibitors. These data suggest that lens regeneration can be achieved in noncompetent adult tissues and that this regeneration occurs through a gene regulatory mechanism that is more complex than the dorsal expression of lens regeneration-specific genes.","Univ Dayton, Dept Biol, Mol Biol Lab, Dayton, OH 45469 USA; Nagoya Univ, Grad Sch Sci, Div Biol Sci, Nagoya, Aichi 464, Japan; Miami Univ, Dept Zool, Oxford, OH 45056 USA","Tsonis, PA (reprint author), Univ Dayton, Dept Biol, Mol Biol Lab, Dayton, OH 45469 USA.",panagiotis.tsonis@notes.udayton.edu,,"Vergara, Maria Natalia/0000-0003-4545-8181",NEI NIH HHS [R01 EY010540],,,23,78,79,1,7,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,8-Dec,2005,438,7069,,,,,858,862,,10.1038/nature04175,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,990XX,WOS:000233777800052,16341014,No,,,11/20/17

Attachment to and colonization of abiotic or biotic surfaces is a common mechanism by which various microorganisms enhance their ability to survive in diverse environments(1). Vibrio cholerae is a Gram-negative aquatic bacillus that is often found in the environment attached to the chitinous exo-skeletons of zooplankton(2,3). It has been suggested that attachment to zooplankton enhances environmental survival of Vibrio spp., probably by providing both an abundant source of carbon and nitrogen and protection from numerous environmental challenges(4). On ingestion by humans, some serogroups of V. cholerae cause the diarrhoeal disease cholera(5). The pathophysiology of cholera is a result of the effects of cholera toxin on intestinal epithelial cells. For sufficient quantities of cholera toxin to reach the intestinal epithelium and to produce clinical symptoms, colonization of the small bowel must occur. Because most V. cholerae do not colonize humans, but all probably require strategies for survival in the environment, we considered that colonization factors selected for in the environment may be the same as those required for intestinal colonization of humans. In support of this hypothesis, here we have identified a single protein required for efficient intestinal colonization that mediates attachment to both zooplankton and human epithelial cells by binding to a sugar present on both surfaces.","Dartmouth Coll Sch Med, Dept Microbiol & Immunol, Hanover, NH 03755 USA","Taylor, RK (reprint author), Dartmouth Coll Sch Med, Dept Microbiol & Immunol, Hanover, NH 03755 USA.",Ronald.K.Taylor@dartmouth.edu,,,,,,27,159,170,2,24,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,8-Dec,2005,438,7069,,,,,863,866,,10.1038/nature04249,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,990XX,WOS:000233777800053,16341015,No,,,11/20/17

LDL-receptor-related proteins 5 and 6 (LRP5 and LRP6; Arrow in Drosophila) are key receptors required for transmission of Wnt/beta-catenin signalling in metazoa(3). Although the role of these receptors in Wnt signalling is well established, their coupling with the cytoplasmic signalling apparatus remains poorly defined. Using a protein modification screen for regulators of LRP6, we describe the identification of Xenopus Casein kinase 1 gamma (CK1 gamma), a membrane-bound member of the CK1 family. Gain-of-function and loss-of-function experiments show that CK1 gamma is both necessary and sufficient to transduce LRP6 signalling in vertebrates and Drosophila cells. In Xenopus embryos, CK1 gamma is required during anterio-posterior patterning to promote posteriorizing Wnt/beta-catenin signalling. CK1 gamma is associated with LRP6, which has multiple, modular CK1 phosphorylation sites. Wnt treatment induces the rapid CK1 gamma-mediated phosphorylation of these sites within LRP6, which, in turn, promotes the recruitment of the scaffold protein Axin. Our results reveal an evolutionarily conserved mechanism that couples Wnt receptor activation to the cytoplasmic signal transduction apparatus.","Deutsch Krebsforschungszentrum, Div Mol Embryol, D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany","Niehrs, C (reprint author), Deutsch Krebsforschungszentrum, Div Mol Embryol, Neuenheimer Feld 280, D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany.",g.davidson@dkfz-heidelberg.de; Niehrs@dkfz-heidelberg.de,"Shen, Jinlong/D-5389-2009; Davidson, Gary/J-6059-2013","Bilic Zimmermann, Josipa/0000-0001-9642-6265",,,,23,345,365,0,25,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,8-Dec,2005,438,7069,,,,,867,872,,10.1038/nature04170,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,990XX,WOS:000233777800054,16341016,No,,,11/20/17

The canonical Wnt/beta-catenin pathway requires a single-span transmembrane receptor, low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-receptor-related protein 6 (LRP6)(2-4), whose phosphorylation at multiple PPPSP motifs is induced upon stimulation by Wnt and is critical for signal transduction(5). The kinase responsible for LRP6 phosphorylation has not been identified. Here we provide biochemical and genetic evidence for a 'dual-kinase' mechanism for LRP6 phosphorylation and activation. Glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3), which is known for its inhibitory role in Wnt signalling through the promotion of beta-catenin phosphorylation and degradation, mediates the phosphorylation and activation of LRP6. We show that Wnt induces sequential phosphorylation of LRP6 by GSK3 and casein kinase 1, and this dual phosphorylation promotes the engagement of LRP6 with the scaffolding protein Axin. We show further that a membrane-associated form of GSK3, in contrast with cytosolic GSK3, stimulates Wnt signalling and Xenopus axis duplication. Our results identify two key kinases mediating Wnt co-receptor activation, reveal an unexpected and intricate logic of Wnt/beta-catenin signalling, and illustrate GSK3 as a genuine switch that dictates both on and off states of a pivotal regulatory pathway.","Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Childrens Hosp Boston, Dept Neurol,Neurobiol Program, Boston, MA 02115 USA; Harvard Univ, Sch Med, CBR Inst, Boston, MA 02115 USA; Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Pathol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; Princess Margaret Hosp, Ontario Canc Inst, Toronto, ON M5G 2M9, Canada","He, X (reprint author), Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Childrens Hosp Boston, Dept Neurol,Neurobiol Program, Boston, MA 02115 USA.",xi.he@childrens.harvard.edu,"Woodgett, Jim/F-1087-2010; Doble, Bradley/L-7551-2016","Woodgett, Jim/0000-0003-3731-5797; Doble, Bradley/0000-0002-0260-2983","NIGMS NIH HHS [R01 GM074241, R01 GM074241-01]",,,30,474,495,4,36,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,8-Dec,2005,438,7069,,,,,873,877,,10.1038/nature04185,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,990XX,WOS:000233777800055,16341017,No,,,11/20/17

The issue of how unwanted protein association is normally avoided in a living system is particularly significant in the context of the evolution of multidomain proteins, which account for over 70% of all eukaryotic proteins(3), where the effective local protein concentration in the vicinity of each domain is very high. Here we describe the aggregation kinetics of multidomain protein constructs of immunoglobulin domains and the ability of different homologous domains to aggregate together. We show that aggregation of these proteins is a specific process and that the efficiency of coaggregation between different domains decreases markedly with decreasing sequence identity. Thus, whereas immunoglobulin domains with more than about 70% identity are highly prone to coaggregation, those with less than 30 - 40% sequence identity do not detectably interact. A bioinformatics analysis of consecutive homologous domains in large multidomain proteins shows that such domains almost exclusively have sequence identities of less than 40%, in other words below the level at which coaggregation is likely to be efficient. We propose that such low sequence identities could have a crucial and general role in safeguarding proteins against misfolding and aggregation.","Univ Cambridge, Dept Chem, MRC, Ctr Prot Engn, Cambridge CB2 1EW, England; MRC, Mol Biol Lab, Cambridge CB2 2QH, England","Clarke, J (reprint author), Univ Cambridge, Dept Chem, MRC, Ctr Prot Engn, Lensfield Rd, Cambridge CB2 1EW, England.",jc162@cam.ac.uk; cmd44@cam.ac.uk,"Wright, Caroline/N-5355-2015","Wright, Caroline/0000-0003-2958-5076; Teichmann, Sarah/0000-0002-6294-6366",Wellcome Trust,,,30,187,188,2,41,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,8-Dec,2005,438,7069,,,,,878,881,,10.1038/nature04195,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,990XX,WOS:000233777800056,16341018,No,,,11/20/17

The ribosome, which carries out protein synthesis, is one such machine, and the 30S subunit of the bacterial ribosome is the preeminent model system for biophysical analysis of large RNA - protein complexes. Our understanding of 30S assembly is incomplete, owing to the challenges of monitoring the association of many components simultaneously. Here we have developed a method involving pulse - chase monitored by quantitative mass spectrometry ( PC/ QMS) to follow the assembly of the 20 ribosomal proteins with 16S ribosomal RNA during formation of the functional particle. These data represent a detailed and quantitative kinetic characterization of the assembly of a large multicomponent macromolecular complex. By measuring the protein binding rates at a range of temperatures, we find that local transformations throughout the assembling subunit have similar but distinct activation energies. Thus, the prevailing view of 30S assembly as a pathway proceeding through a global rate-limiting conformational change must give way to one in which the assembly of the complex traverses a landscape dotted with various local conformational transitions.","Scripps Res Inst, Dept Mol Biol, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; Scripps Res Inst, Dept Chem, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; Scripps Res Inst, Skaggs Inst Chem Biol, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA","Williamson, JR (reprint author), Scripps Res Inst, Dept Mol Biol, 10666 N Torrey Pines Rd, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA.",jrwill@scripps.edu,"Williamson, James/B-2891-2009","Williamson, James/0000-0002-8772-468X; Siuzdak, Gary/0000-0002-4749-0014",NIGMS NIH HHS [R01 GM053757],,,36,170,174,0,12,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,1-Dec,2005,438,7068,,,,,628,632,,10.1038/nature04261,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,988JY,WOS:000233593100041,16319883,No,,,11/20/17

Entangled particles are non- interacting but are described by a common wavefunction; consequently, individual particles are not independent of each other and their quantum properties are inextricably interwoven(1-3). The intriguing features of entanglement become particularly evident if the particles can be individually controlled and physically separated. However, both the experimental realization and characterization of entanglement become exceedingly difficult for systems with many particles. The main difficulty is to manipulate and detect the quantum state of individual particles as well as to control the interaction between them. So far, entanglement of four ions(4) or five photons(5) has been demonstrated experimentally. The creation of scalable multiparticle entanglement demands a non- exponential scaling of resources with particle number. Among the various kinds of entangled states, the 'W state'(6-8) plays an important role as its entanglement is maximally persistent and robust even under particle loss. Such states are central as a resource in quantum information processing(9) and multiparty quantum communication. Here we report the scalable and deterministic generation of four-, five-, six-, seven- and eight- particle entangled states of the W type with trapped ions. We obtain the maximum possible information on these states by performing full characterization via state tomography(10), using individual control and detection of the ions. A detailed analysis proves that the entanglement is genuine.

Such properties form the basis of present- day semiconductor technology. If the doping concentration n exceeds a critical value n(c), the system passes through an insulator- to- metal transition and exhibits metallic behaviour; this is widely accepted to occur as a consequence of the impurity levels merging to form energy bands(2). However, the electronic structure of semiconductors doped beyond nc have not been explored in detail. Therefore, the recent observation of superconductivity emerging near the insulator- to- metal transition(3) in heavily boron- doped diamond(4,5) has stimulated a discussion on the fundamental origin of the metallic states responsible for the superconductivity. Two approaches have been adopted for describing this metallic state: the introduction of charge carriers into either the impurity bands(6) or the intrinsic diamond bands(7-9). Here we show experimentally that the doping- dependent occupied electronic structures are consistent with the diamond bands, indicating that holes in the diamond bands play an essential part in determining the metallic nature of the heavily boron- doped diamond superconductor. This supports the diamond band approach and related predictions, including the possibility of achieving dopant- induced superconductivity in silicon and germanium(7). It should also provide a foundation for the possible development of diamond- based devices(10).","JASRI SPring8, Sayo, Hyogo 6795198, Japan; Okayama Univ, Grad Sch Nat Sci & Technol, Okayama 7008530, Japan; Natl Inst Mat Sci, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3050047, Japan; Waseda Univ, Sch Sci & Engn, Tokyo 1698555, Japan; Hiroshima Univ, Grad Sch Sci Matter ADSM, Dept Quantum Matter, Higashihiroshima 7398530, Japan","Yokoya, T (reprint author), JASRI SPring8, 1-1-1 Kouto, Sayo, Hyogo 6795198, Japan.",yokoya@cc.okayama-u.ac.jp,"TAKANO, Yoshihiko/H-2788-2011; YOKOYA, Takayoshi/B-1478-2011; Kawarada, Hiroshi/L-6486-2017","Nagao, Masanori/0000-0002-1139-7838; Matsushita, Tomohiro/0000-0002-2547-3811",,,,20,160,160,7,62,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,1-Dec,2005,438,7068,,,,,647,650,,10.1038/nature04278,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,988JY,WOS:000233593100045,16319887,No,,,11/20/17

Organic particles(10) are usually prepared through polymerization of suitable monomers(11) or precipitation methods(12). In the case of inorganic materials, particle fabrication tends to involve the reduction of a metal salt(13), or the controlled mixing of salt solutions supplying a metal cation and an elemental anion ( for example, S2-, Se2- , O2-) (14), respectively; in some instances, these methods even afford direct control over the shape of the particles produced(14 - 17). Another class of materials are metal- organic coordination polymers(18 - 23), which are based on metal ions coordinated by polydentate organic ligands and explored for potential use in catalysis(18), gas storage(19,20), nonlinear optics(21) and molecular recognition and separations(22,23). In a subset of these materials, the use of organometallic complexes as ligands ( so- called metalloligands) provides an additional level of tailorability, but these materials have so far not yet been fashioned into nano- or microparticles. Here we show that simple addition of an initiation solvent to a precursor solution of metal ions and metalloligands results in the spontaneous and fully reversible formation of a new class of metal - metalloligand particles. We observe initial formation of particles with diameters of a few hundred nanometres, which then coalesce and anneal into uniform and smooth microparticles. The ease with which these particles can be fabricated, and the ability to tailor their chemical and physical properties through the choice of metal and organic ligand used, should facilitate investigations of their scope for practical applications.","Northwestern Univ, Dept Chem, Evanston, IL 60208 USA; Northwestern Univ, Inst Nanotechnol, Evanston, IL 60208 USA","Mirkin, CA (reprint author), Northwestern Univ, Dept Chem, 2145 Sheridan Rd, Evanston, IL 60208 USA.",chadnano@northwestern.edu,"Mirkin, Chad/E-3911-2010",,,,,26,424,433,18,253,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,1-Dec,2005,438,7068,,,,,651,654,,10.1038/nature04191,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,988JY,WOS:000233593100046,16319888,No,,,11/20/17

Its heat transport makes a substantial contribution to the moderate climate of maritime and continental Europe, and any slowdown in the overturning circulation would have profound implications for climate change. A transatlantic section along latitude 25 degrees N has been used as a baseline for estimating the overturning circulation and associated heat transport(2 - 4). Here we analyse a new 25 degrees N transatlantic section and compare it with four previous sections taken over the past five decades. The comparison suggests that the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation has slowed by about 30 per cent between 1957 and 2004. Whereas the northward transport in the Gulf Stream across 25 degrees N has remained nearly constant, the slowing is evident both in a 50 per cent larger southward- moving mid- ocean recirculation of thermocline waters, and also in a 50 per cent decrease in the southward transport of lower North Atlantic Deep Water between 3,000 and 5,000 m in depth. In 2004, more of the northward Gulf Stream flow was recirculating back southward in the thermocline within the subtropical gyre, and less was returning southward at depth.","Natl Oceanog Ctr, Southampton SO14 3ZH, Hants, England","Bryden, HL (reprint author), Natl Oceanog Ctr, Empress Dock, Southampton SO14 3ZH, Hants, England.",h.bryden@noc.soton.ac.uk,,"Bryden, Harry/0000-0002-8216-6359",,,,30,384,400,8,132,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,1-Dec,2005,438,7068,,,,,655,657,,10.1038/nature04385,,3,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,988JY,WOS:000233593100047,16319889,No,,,11/20/17

Previously, we demonstrated that a mechanism of dispersal limitation also fits RSA data well(3,4). Here we compare fits of the dispersal and density- dependence mechanisms for empirical RSA data on tree species in six New and Old World tropical forests and show that both mechanisms offer sufficient and independent explanations. We suggest that RSA data cannot by themselves be used to discriminate among these explanations of RSA patterns(15) - empirical studies will be required to determine whether RSA patterns are due to one or the other mechanism, or to some combination of both.","Penn State Univ, Dept Phys, Davey Lab 104, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; Univ Alberta, Dept Renewable Resources, Edmonton, AB T6G 2H1, Canada; Univ Georgia, Dept Plant Biol, Athens, GA 30602 USA; Smithsonian Trop Res Inst, Balboa, Panama; Univ Padua, Dipartimento Fis G Galilei, I-35131 Padua, Italy","Banavar, JR (reprint author), Penn State Univ, Dept Phys, Davey Lab 104, University Pk, PA 16802 USA.",banavar@psu.edu; maritan@pd.infn.it,,,,,,24,165,188,1,94,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,1-Dec,2005,438,7068,,,,,658,661,,10.1038/nature04030,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,988JY,WOS:000233593100048,16319890,No,,,11/20/17

However, the availability of different inbred strains of mice offers an excellent model system in which to study the genetics of certain behavioural phenotypes(1-3). Here we report, using a combination of behavioural analysis of six inbred mouse strains with quantitative gene expression profiling of several brain regions, the identification of 17 genes with expression patterns that correlate with anxiety- like behavioural phenotypes. To determine if two of the genes, glyoxalase 1 and glutathione reductase 1, have a causal role in the genesis of anxiety, we performed genetic manipulation using lentivirus- mediated gene transfer. Local overexpression of these genes in the mouse brain resulted in increased anxiety- like behaviour, while local inhibition of glyoxalase 1 expression by RNA interference decreased the anxiety- like behaviour.

We analyse the time series of peak expiratory flows, a standard measurement of airway function that has been assessed twice daily in a large asthmatic population during a long- term crossover clinical trial(4). Here we introduce an approach to predict the risk of worsening airflow obstruction by calculating the conditional probability that, given the current airway condition, a severe obstruction will occur within 30 days. We find that, compared with a placebo, a regular long- acting bronchodilator ( salmeterol) that is widely used to improve asthma control decreases the risk of airway obstruction. Unexpectedly, however, a regular short- acting beta(2)-agonist bronchodilator ( albuterol) increases this risk. Furthermore, we find that the time series of peak expiratory flows show long- range correlations that change significantly with disease severity, approaching a random process with increased variability in the most severe cases. Using a nonlinear stochastic model, we show that both the increased variability and the loss of correlations augment the risk of unstable airway function. The characterization of fluctuations in airway function provides a quantitative basis for objective risk prediction of asthma episodes and for evaluating the effectiveness of therapy.","Univ Hosp Bern, Inselspital, Dept Paediat, CH-3010 Bern, Switzerland; Boston Univ, Dept Biomed Engn, Boston, MA 02215 USA; Univ Otago, Dunedin Sch Med, Fac Med, Dunedin, New Zealand; Univ Otago, Christchurch Sch Med, Fac Med, Dunedin, New Zealand; Univ Leicester, Inst Lung Hlth, Leicester LE2 7LX, Leics, England","Frey, U (reprint author), Univ Hosp Bern, Inselspital, Dept Paediat, CH-3010 Bern, Switzerland.",urs.frey@insel.ch,"Majumdar, Arnab/A-8096-2008",,,,,17,115,117,0,10,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,1-Dec,2005,438,7068,,,,,667,670,,10.1038/nature04176,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,988JY,WOS:000233593100050,16319891,No,,,11/20/17

Here we describe, with the use of proteome chip technology(4), the in vitro substrates recognized by most yeast protein kinases(5): we identified over 4,000 phosphorylation events involving 1,325 different proteins. These substrates represent a broad spectrum of different biochemical functions and cellular roles. Distinct sets of substrates were recognized by each protein kinase, including closely related kinases of the protein kinase A family and four cyclin- dependent kinases that vary only in their cyclin subunits. Although many substrates reside in the same cellular compartment or belong to the same functional category as their phosphorylating kinase, many others do not, indicating possible new roles for several kinases. Furthermore, integration of the phosphorylation results with protein - protein interaction(6-10) and transcription factor binding data(11,12) revealed novel regulatory modules.

Intravenous administration of antagomirs against miR- 16, miR- 122, miR- 192 and miR- 194 resulted in a marked reduction of corresponding miRNA levels in liver, lung, kidney, heart, intestine, fat, skin, bone marrow, muscle, ovaries and adrenals. The silencing of endogenous miRNAs by this novel method is specific, efficient and long-lasting. The biological significance of silencing miRNAs with the use of antagomirs was studied for miR- 122, an abundant liver-specific miRNA. Gene expression and bioinformatic analysis of messenger RNA from antagomir- treated animals revealed that the 3' untranslated regions of upregulated genes are strongly enriched in miR- 122 recognition motifs, whereas downregulated genes are depleted in these motifs. Analysis of the functional annotation of downregulated genes specifically predicted that cholesterol biosynthesis genes would be affected by miR- 122, and plasma cholesterol measurements showed reduced levels in antagomir-122- treated mice.

Other functions of the APC/ C are, however, less well defined. Here we show that two APC/ C components, APC5 and APC7, interact directly with the coactivators CBP and p300 through protein - protein interaction domains that are evolutionarily conserved in adenovirus E1A(5-8). This interaction stimulates intrinsic CBP/ p300 acetyltransferase activity and potentiates CBP/ p300- dependent transcription. We also show that APC5 and APC7 suppress E1A- mediated transformation in a CBP/ p300- dependent manner, indicating that these components of the APC/ C may be targeted during cellular transformation. Furthermore, we establish that CBP is required in APC/ C function; specifically, gene ablation of CBP by RNA- mediated interference markedly reduces the E3 ubiquitin ligase activity of the APC/ C and the progression of cells through mitosis. Taken together, our results define discrete roles for the APC/ C - CBP/ p300 complexes in growth regulation.","Univ Birmingham, Sch Med, Canc Res UK Inst Canc Studies, Birmingham B15 2TT, W Midlands, England; Baylor Coll Med, Verna & Marrs McLean Dept Biochem & Mol Biol, Houston, TX 77030 USA; Marie Curie Res Inst, Surrey RH8 OTL, England; Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Ctr Genet & Genom, Dept Genet, Boston, MA 02115 USA; Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Boston, MA 02115 USA","Turnell, AS (reprint author), Univ Birmingham, Sch Med, Canc Res UK Inst Canc Studies, Birmingham B15 2TT, W Midlands, England.",A.S.Turnell@bham.ac.uk,,,,,,30,62,63,0,6,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,1-Dec,2005,438,7068,,,,,690,695,,10.1038/nature04151,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,988JY,WOS:000233593100055,16319895,No,,,11/20/17

In vertebrates, histocompatibility is a function of the immune system controlled by a highly polymorphic major histocompatibility complex (MHC), which encodes proteins that target foreign molecules for immune cell recognition. The association of the MHC and immune function suggests an evolutionary relationship between metazoan histocompatibility and the origins of vertebrate immunity. However, the MHC of vertebrates is the only functionally characterized histocompatibility system; the mechanisms underlying this process in non-vertebrates are unknown. A primitive chordate, the ascidian Botryllus schlosseri, also undergoes a histocompatibility reaction controlled by a highly polymorphic locus. Here we describe the isolation of a candidate gene encoding an immunoglobulin superfamily member that, by itself, predicts the outcome of histocompatibility reactions. This is the first non-vertebrate histocompatibility gene described, and may provide insights into the evolution of vertebrate adaptive immunity.","Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Dept Pathol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Dept Biol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; Stanford Univ, Hopkins Marine Stn, Dept Biol, Pacific Grove, CA 93950 USA","De Tomaso, AW (reprint author), Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Dept Pathol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",tdet@stanford.edu,,,NIAID NIH HHS [R01 AI041588],,,33,127,132,1,12,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,24-Nov,2005,438,7067,,,,,454,459,,10.1038/nature04150,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,986NY,WOS:000233458200040,16306984,No,,,11/20/17

For example, the rotation of the disk twists around the rotation axis the initially vertical magnetic field, which responds by slowing down the plasma in the disk and by causing it to fall towards the central star. The magnetic energy flux produced in this process points away from the disk, pushing the surface plasma outwards, leading to a wind from the disk and sometimes a collimated jet. But these predictions have hitherto not been supported by observations. Here we report the direct detection of the magnetic field in the core of the protostellar accretion disk FU Orionis(8). The surface field reaches strengths of about 1 kG close to the centre of the disk, and it includes a significant azimuthal component, in good agreement with recent models(5). But we find that the field is very filamentary and slows down the disk plasma much more than models predict, which may explain why FU Ori fails to collimate its wind into a jet.","Observ Midi Pyrenees, Astrophys Lab, F-31400 Toulouse, France; Univ Grenoble 1, Lab Astrophys Grenoble, F-38041 Grenoble, France","Donati, JF (reprint author), Observ Midi Pyrenees, Astrophys Lab, F-31400 Toulouse, France.",donati@ast.obs-mip.fr,,"Paletou, Frederic/0000-0003-1970-2929",,,,30,71,72,0,3,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,24-Nov,2005,438,7067,,,,,466,469,,10.1038/nature04253,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,986NY,WOS:000233458200042,16306985,No,,,11/20/17

Harnessing this power requires the development of a set of building blocks(3), one of which is a method to initialize the set of quantum bits (qubits) to a known state. Additionally, fresh ancillary qubits must be available during the course of computation to achieve fault tolerance(4-7). In any physical system used to implement quantum computation, one must therefore be able to selectively and dynamically remove entropy from the part of the system that is to be mapped to qubits. One such method is an 'open-system' cooling protocol in which a subset of qubits can be brought into contact with an external system of large heat capacity. Theoretical efforts(8-10) have led to an implementation-independent cooling procedure, namely heat-bath algorithmic cooling. These efforts have culminated with the proposal of an optimal algorithm, the partner-pairing algorithm, which was used to compute the physical limits of heat-bath algorithmic cooling(11). Here we report the experimental realization of multi-step cooling of a quantum system via heat-bath algorithmic cooling. The experiment was carried out using nuclear magnetic resonance of a solid-state ensemble three-qubit system. We demonstrate the repeated repolarization of a particular qubit to an effective spin-bath temperature, and alternating logical operations within the three-qubit subspace to ultimately cool a second qubit below this temperature. Demonstration of the control necessary for these operations represents an important step forward in the manipulation of solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance qubits.","Univ Waterloo, Inst Quantum Comp, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada; Univ Waterloo, Dept Combinator & Optimizat, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada; Perimeter Inst Theoret Phys, Waterloo, ON N2L 2Y5, Canada","Baugh, J (reprint author), Univ Waterloo, Inst Quantum Comp, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada.",baugh@iqc.ca,"Baugh, Jonathan/F-3879-2011",,,,,22,62,62,1,6,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,24-Nov,2005,438,7067,,,,,470,473,,10.1038/nature04272,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,986NY,WOS:000233458200043,16306986,No,,,11/20/17

Angle-resolved photoemission measurements in the superconducting state have revealed a quasiparticle spectrum with a d-wave gap structure that exhibits a maximum along the antinodal direction and vanishes along the nodal direction(1). Subsequent measurements have shown that, at low doping levels, this gap structure persists even in the high-temperature metallic state, although the nodal points of the superconducting state spread out in finite 'Fermi arcs'(2). This is the so-called pseudogap phase, and it has been assumed that it is closely linked to the superconducting state, either by assigning it to fluctuating superconductivity(3) or by invoking orders which are natural competitors of d-wave superconductors(4,5). Here we report experimental evidence that a very similar pseudogap state with a nodal-antinodal dichotomous character exists in a system that is markedly different from a superconductor: the ferromagnetic metallic groundstate of the colossal magnetoresistive bilayer manganite La1.2Sr1.8Mn2O7.

In such experiments, a laser pulse normally excites several nanostructures at once. However, spectroscopic information may also be acquired using pulses from an electron beam in a modern electron microscope, exploiting a phenomenon called cathodoluminescence. This approach offers several advantages. The multimode imaging capabilities of the electron microscope enable the correlation of optical properties (via cathodoluminescence) with surface morphology (secondary electron mode) at the nanometre scale(2). The broad energy range of the electrons can excite wide-bandgap materials, such as diamond- or gallium-nitride-based structures that are not easily excited by conventional optical means. But perhaps most intriguingly, the small beam can probe a single selected nanostructure. Here we apply an original time-resolved cathodoluminescence set-up to describe carrier dynamics within single gallium-arsenide-based pyramidal nanostructures(3) with a time resolution of 10 picoseconds and a spatial resolution of 50 nanometres.

Here we present high-resolution climate proxy records, covering the period from 14.7 to 12.7 million years ago, from two complete sediment cores from the northwest and southeast subtropical Pacific Ocean. Using new chronologies through the correlation to the latest orbital model(9), we find relatively constant, low summer insolation over Antarctica coincident with declining atmospheric carbon dioxide levels at the time of Antarctic ice-sheet expansion and global cooling, suggesting a causal link. We surmise that the thermal isolation of Antarctica played a role in providing sustained long-term climatic boundary conditions propitious for ice-sheet formation.

Previous studies on dry (water-free) melts showed that the density of silicate melts can be higher than that of surrounding solids under deep mantle conditions(3-8). However, melts formed under deep mantle conditions are also likely to contain some water(2), which will reduce the melt density. Here we present data constraining the density of hydrous silicate melt at the conditions of similar to 410 km depth. We show that the water in the silicate melt is more compressible than the other components, and therefore the effect of water in reducing melt density is markedly diminished under high-pressure conditions. Our study indicates that there is a range of conditions under which a ( hydrous) melt could be trapped at the 410-km boundary and hence incompatible elements could be sequestered in the deep mantle, although these conditions are sensitive to melt composition as well as the composition of the surrounding mantle.","Ibaraki Univ, Dept Environm Sci, Ibaraki 3100056, Japan; Yale Univ, Dept Geol & Geophys, New Haven, CT 06520 USA","Matsukage, KN (reprint author), Ibaraki Univ, Dept Environm Sci, Ibaraki 3100056, Japan.",kmatsu@mx.ibaraki.ac.jp,"Jing, Zhicheng/A-4549-2009","Jing, Zhicheng/0000-0002-1508-3238",,,,30,76,82,3,37,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,24-Nov,2005,438,7067,,,,,488,491,,10.1038/nature04241,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,986NY,WOS:000233458200047,16306990,No,,,11/20/17

Such binocular rivalry is associated with relative suppression of local, eye-based representations(1-4) that can also be modulated by high-level influences such as perceptual grouping(3,5,6). However, it is currently unclear how early in visual processing the suppression of eye-based signals can occur. Here we use high-resolution functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in conjunction with a new binocular rivalry stimulus to show that signals recorded from the human lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) exhibit eye-specific suppression during rivalry. Regions of the LGN that show strong eye-preference independently show strongly reduced activity during binocular rivalry when the stimulus presented in their preferred eye is perceptually suppressed. The human LGN is thus the earliest stage of visual processing that reflects eye-specific dominance and suppression.","UCL, Inst Neurol, Wellcome Dept Imaging Neurosci, London WC1N 3BG, England; UCL, Inst Cognit Neurosci, London WC1N 3AR, England","Haynes, JD (reprint author), UCL, Inst Neurol, Wellcome Dept Imaging Neurosci, 12 Queen Sq, London WC1N 3BG, England.",haynes@fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk,"Rees, Geraint/C-1493-2008; Haynes, John-Dylan/Q-1148-2016","Rees, Geraint/0000-0002-9623-7007; Haynes, John-Dylan/0000-0003-1786-6954","Wellcome Trust [, 067453]",,,31,218,221,1,18,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,24-Nov,2005,438,7067,,,,,496,499,,10.1038/nature04169,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,986NY,WOS:000233458200049,16244649,No,,,11/20/17

This extreme limitation necessitates efficient mechanisms to select only the most relevant objects from the immediate environment to be represented in memory and to restrict irrelevant items from consuming capacity(3-5). Here we report a neurophysiological measure of this memory selection mechanism in humans that gauges an individual's efficiency at excluding irrelevant items from being stored in memory. By examining the moment-by-moment contents of visual memory(6), we observe that selection efficiency varies substantially across individuals and is strongly predicted by the particular memory capacity of each person. Specifically, high capacity individuals are much more efficient at representing only the relevant items than are low capacity individuals, who inefficiently encode and maintain information about the irrelevant items present in the display. These results provide evidence that under many circumstances low capacity individuals may actually store more information in memory than high capacity individuals. Indeed, this ancillary allocation of memory capacity to irrelevant objects may be a primary source of putative differences in overall storage capacity.","Univ Oregon, Dept Psychol, Eugene, OR 97403 USA","Vogel, EK (reprint author), Univ Oregon, Dept Psychol, Eugene, OR 97403 USA.",vogel@uoregon.edu,"Machizawa, Maro/B-5918-2008","Machizawa, Maro/0000-0002-5727-1421",,,,24,559,575,4,74,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,24-Nov,2005,438,7067,,,,,500,503,,10.1038/nature04171,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,986NY,WOS:000233458200050,16306992,No,,,11/20/17

In particular, networks involved in gene regulation or signal transduction allow only for small output tolerances, and the underlying network structures can be expected to have undergone evolution for inherent robustness against perturbations(1). Here we combine theoretical and experimental analyses to investigate an optimal design for the signalling network of bacterial chemotaxis, one of the most thoroughly studied signalling networks in biology. We experimentally determine the extent of intercellular variations in the expression levels of chemotaxis proteins and use computer simulations to quantify the robustness of several hypothetical chemotaxis pathway topologies to such gene expression noise. We demonstrate that among these topologies the experimentally established chemotaxis network of Escherichia coli has the smallest sufficiently robust network structure, allowing accurate chemotactic response for almost all individuals within a population. Our results suggest that this pathway has evolved to show an optimal chemotactic performance while minimizing the cost of resources associated with high levels of protein expression. Moreover, the underlying topological design principles compensating for intercellular variations seem to be highly conserved among bacterial chemosensory systems(2).","Univ Freiburg, Inst Phys, D-79104 Freiburg, Germany; Heidelberg Univ, ZMBH, D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany; Univ Freiburg, FDM, D-79104 Freiburg, Germany","Kollmann, M (reprint author), Univ Freiburg, Inst Phys, Hermann Herder Str 3, D-79104 Freiburg, Germany.",markus.kollmann@fdm.uni-freiburg.de; v.sourjik@zmbh.uni-heidelberg.de,"Bartholome, Kilian/F-1691-2011; Bartholome, Kilian/A-9593-2013","Bartholome, Kilian/0000-0001-6525-777X; Bartholome, Kilian/0000-0001-6525-777X",,,,30,199,204,3,28,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,24-Nov,2005,438,7067,,,,,504,507,,10.1038/nature04228,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,986NY,WOS:000233458200051,16306993,No,,,11/20/17

In response to antigens, B cells undergo two types of genomic alterations to increase antibody diversity. Affinity for antigen can be increased by introduction of point mutations into IgH and IgL variable regions by somatic hypermutation. In addition, antibody effector functions can be altered by changing the expressed IgH constant region exons through IgH class switch recombination (CSR)(1-3). Somatic hypermutation and CSR both require the B-cell-specific activation-induced cytidine deaminase protein (AID)(4-6), which initiates these reactions through its single-stranded (ss)DNA-specific cytidine deaminase activity(7-11). In biochemical assays, replication protein A (RPA), a ssDNA-binding protein(12), associates with phosphorylated AID from activated B cells and enhances AID activity on transcribed double-stranded (ds)DNA containing somatic hypermutation or CSR target sequences. This AID-RPA association, which requires phosphorylation, may provide a mechanism for allowing AID to access dsDNA targets in activated B cells(13,14). Here we show that AID from B cells is phosphorylated on a consensus protein kinase A (PKA) site and that PKA is the physiological AID kinase. Thus, AID from non-lymphoid cells can be functionally phosphorylated by recombinant PKA to allow interaction with RPA and promote deamination of transcribed dsDNA substrates. Moreover, mutation of the major PKA phosphorylation site of AID preserves ssDNA deamination activity, but markedly reduces RPA-dependent dsDNA deamination activity and severely impairs the ability of AID to effect CSR in vivo. We conclude that PKA has a critical role in post-translational regulation of AID activity in B cells.","Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Childrens Hosp,CBR Inst Biomed Res, Boston, MA 02115 USA; Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Genet, Boston, MA 02115 USA; Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Childrens Hosp, Joint Program Transfus Med,Dept Pathol, Boston, MA 02115 USA","Alt, FW (reprint author), Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Childrens Hosp,CBR Inst Biomed Res, Boston, MA 02115 USA.",alt@enders.tch.harvard.edu,,,,,,29,172,175,3,13,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,24-Nov,2005,438,7067,,,,,508,511,,10.1038/nature04255,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,986NY,WOS:000233458200052,16251902,No,,,11/20/17

This localization requires the oncofetal protein ZBP1 (Zipcode binding protein 1), which binds to a conserved 54-nucleotide element in the 30 untranslated region of the beta-actin mRNA known as the 'zipcode'. ZBP1 promotes translocation of the beta-actin transcript to actin-rich protrusions in primary fibroblasts and neurons(6,7). It is not known how the ZBP1-RNA complex achieves asymmetric protein sorting by localizing beta-actin mRNA. Here we show that chicken ZBP1 modulates the translation of beta-actinmRNA. ZBP1 associates with the beta-actin transcript in the nucleus and prevents premature translation in the cytoplasm by blocking translation initiation. Translation only occurs when the ZBP1-RNA complex reaches its destination at the periphery of the cell. At the endpoint of mRNA transport, the protein kinase Src promotes translation by phosphorylating a key tyrosine residue in ZBP1 that is required for binding to RNA. These sequential events provide both temporal and spatial control over beta-actin mRNA translation, which is important for cell migration and neurite outgrowth.","Yeshiva Univ Albert Einstein Coll Med, Dept Anat & Struct Biol, Bronx, NY 10461 USA; Univ Halle Wittenberg, Dept Med, ZAMED, D-06120 Halle An Der Saale, Germany; Yeshiva Univ Albert Einstein Coll Med, Rose Kennedy Ctr Mental Retardat, Dept Neurosci, Bronx, NY 10461 USA","Singer, RH (reprint author), Yeshiva Univ Albert Einstein Coll Med, Dept Anat & Struct Biol, 1300 Morris Pk Ave, Bronx, NY 10461 USA.",stefan.huettelmaier@medizin.uni-halle.de; rhsinger@aecom.yu.edu,"Zenklusen, Daniel/C-4503-2008","Zenklusen, Daniel/0000-0002-0067-0093",,,,25,351,358,1,27,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,24-Nov,2005,438,7067,,,,,512,515,,10.1038/nature04115,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,986NY,WOS:000233458200053,16306994,No,,,11/20/17

In prokaryotes, partition is mediated by par systems, for which the P1 plasmid system of Escherichia coli is a prototype comprising a partition site and two proteins, ParA and ParB(1,2). To form the partition complex necessary for segregation, P1 ParB must recognize a complicated arrangement of A-box and B-box DNA motifs located on opposite ends of a sharply bent parS partition site of similar to 74 bp (refs 3-7). Here we describe structures of ParB bound to partition sites. ParB forms an asymmetric dimer with extended amino-terminal HTH (helix-turn-helix) domains that contact A-boxes. The two HTH domains emanate from a dimerized DNA-binding module composed of a six-stranded beta-sheet coiled-coil that binds B-boxes. Strikingly, these individual DNA-binding modules rotate freely about a flexible linker, enabling them to contact several arrangements of A- and B-boxes. Most notably, each DNA-binding element binds to and thus bridges adjacent DNA duplexes. These unique structural features of ParB explain how this protein can bind complex arrays of A- and B-box elements on adjacent DNA arms of the looped partition site.","Oregon Hlth & Sci Univ, Dept Biochem & Mol Biol, Portland, OR 97239 USA; Univ Toronto, Dept Mol & Med Genet, Toronto, ON M5S 1A8, Canada","Schumacher, MA (reprint author), Univ Texas, MD Anderson Canc Ctr, Dept Biochem & Mol Biol, Unit 1000,1515 Holcombe Blvd, Houston, TX 77030 USA.",schumacm@ohsu.edu,,"Funnell, Barbara/0000-0002-1828-6567",,,,30,69,69,0,12,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,24-Nov,2005,438,7067,,,,,516,519,,10.1038/nature04149,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,986NY,WOS:000233458200054,16306995,No,,,11/20/17

Here we describe three new structures of the large ribosomal subunit of Haloarcula marismortui (Hma) complexed with peptidyl transferase substrate analogues that reveal an induced-fit mechanism in which substrates and active-site residues reposition to allow the peptidyl transferase reaction. Proper binding of an aminoacyl-tRNA analogue to the A site induces specific movements of 23S rRNA nucleotides 2618-2620 (Escherichia coli numbering 2583-2585) and 2541(2506), thereby reorienting the ester group of the peptidyl-tRNA and making it accessible for attack. In the absence of the appropriate A-site substrate, the peptidyl transferase centre positions the ester link of the peptidyl-tRNA in a conformation that precludes the catalysed nucleophilic attack by water. Protein release factors(2) may also function, in part, by inducing an active-site rearrangement similar to that produced by the A-site aminoacyl-tRNA, allowing the carbonyl group and water to be positioned for hydrolysis.","Yale Univ, Dept Mol Biophys & Biochem, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; Yale Univ, Dept Chem, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; Howard Hughes Med Inst, New Haven, CT 06520 USA","Steitz, TA (reprint author), Yale Univ, Dept Mol Biophys & Biochem, POB 6666, New Haven, CT 06520 USA.",eatherton@csb.yale.edu,"Steitz, Thomas/C-6559-2009","Huang, Kevin/0000-0002-9930-0972",,,,29,221,228,4,20,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,24-Nov,2005,438,7067,,,,,520,524,,10.1038/nature04152,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,986NY,WOS:000233458200055,16306996,No,,,11/20/17

Under gravitational collapse, star-forming molecular clumps, of typically hundreds to thousands of solar masses (M.), fragment into gaseous cores that subsequently collapse to make individual stars or small multiple systems(1-3). In contrast, competitive accretion theory suggests that at birth all stars are much smaller than the typical stellar mass (similar to 0.5M.), and that final stellar masses are determined by the subsequent accretion of unbound gas from the clump(4-8). Competitive accretion models interpret brown dwarfs and free-floating planets as protostars ejected from star-forming clumps before they have accreted much mass; key predictions of this model are that such objects should lack disks, have high velocity dispersions, form more frequently in denser clumps(9-11), and that the mean stellar mass should vary within the Galaxy(8). Here we derive the rate of competitive accretion as a function of the star-forming environment, based partly on simulation(12), and determine in what types of environments competitive accretion can occur. We show that no observed star-forming region can undergo significant competitive accretion, and that the simulations that show competitive accretion do so because the assumed properties differ from those determined by observation. Our result shows that stars form by gravitational collapse, and explains why observations have failed to confirm predictions of the competitive accretion model.","Princeton Univ, Dept Astrophys, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Phys, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Astron, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; Lawrence Livermore Natl Lab, Livermore, CA 94550 USA","Krumholz, MR (reprint author), Princeton Univ, Dept Astrophys, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA.",krumholz@astro.princeton.edu,,"Krumholz, Mark/0000-0003-3893-854X",,,,30,95,95,0,3,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,17-Nov,2005,438,7066,,,,,332,334,,10.1038/nature04280,,3,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,984JR,WOS:000233300200042,16292305,No,,,11/20/17

Extension of the approach described in ref. 7 to achieve the necessary high-frequency magnetic response in visible optics presents a formidable challenge(12-15), as no material-natural or artificial-is known to exhibit any magnetism at these frequencies. Here we report a nanofabricated medium consisting of electromagnetically coupled pairs of gold dots with geometry carefully designed at a 10-nm level. The medium exhibits a strong magnetic response at visible-light frequencies, including a band with negative m. The magnetism arises owing to the excitation of an antisymmetric plasmon resonance. The high-frequency permeability qualitatively reveals itself via optical impedance matching.

One widely studied example of an effect that has its roots in the electron's spin degree of freedom is the torque exerted by a spin-polarized electric current on the spin moment of a nanometre-scale magnet. This torque causes the magnetic moment to rotate(1-19) at potentially useful frequencies. Here we report a very different phenomenon that is also based on the interplay between spin dynamics and spin-dependent transport, and which arises from unusual diode behaviour. We show that the application of a small radio-frequency alternating current to a nanometre-scale magnetic tunnel junction(20-22) can generate a measurable direct-current (d.c.) voltage across the device when the frequency is resonant with the spin oscillations that arise from the spin-torque effect: at resonance (which can be tuned by an external magnetic field), the structure exhibits different resistance states depending on the direction of the current. This behaviour is markedly different from that of a conventional semiconductor diode(23), and could form the basis of a nanometre-scale radio-frequency detector in telecommunication circuits.","Natl Inst Adv Ind Sci & Technol AIST, Nanoelectr Res Ctr, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058568, Japan; Japan Sci & Technol Agcy, CREST, Kawaguchi 3320012, Japan; Osaka Univ, Grad Sch Engn Sci, Osaka 5608531, Japan; Canon ANELVA Corp, Electron Device Equipment Div, Tokyo 1838508, Japan","Suzuki, Y (reprint author), Natl Inst Adv Ind Sci & Technol AIST, Nanoelectr Res Ctr, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058568, Japan.",suzuki-y@mp.es.osaka-u.ac.jp,"SUZUKI, Yoshishige/D-2652-2013; Yuasa, Shinji/H-2804-2016","Yuasa, Shinji/0000-0003-1093-9057",,,,29,428,432,6,104,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,17-Nov,2005,438,7066,,,,,339,342,,10.1038/nature04207,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,984JR,WOS:000233300200044,16292307,No,,,11/20/17

Here we demonstrate high-speed long-distance communication based on chaos synchronization over a commercial fibre-optic channel. An optical carrier wave generated by a chaotic laser is used to encode a message for transmission over 120 km of optical fibre in the metropolitan area network of Athens, Greece. The message is decoded using an appropriate second laser which, by synchronizing with the chaotic carrier, allows for the separation of the carrier and the message. Transmission rates in the gigabit per second range are achieved, with corresponding bit-error rates below 10(-7). The system uses matched pairs of semiconductor lasers as chaotic emitters and receivers, and off-the-shelf fibre-optic telecommunication components. Our results show that information can be transmitted at high bit rates using deterministic chaos in a manner that is robust to perturbations and channel disturbances unavoidable under real-world conditions.","Univ Illes Balears, Dept Fis, E-07122 Palma De Mallorca, Spain; Univ Athens, Dept Informat, Athens 15784, Greece; Univ Franche Comte, CNRS, UMR 6174, FEMTOST Opt, F-25030 Besancon, France; Univ Pavia, Dept Elect, I-27100 Pavia, Italy; UIB, CSIC, IMEDEA, Inst Mediterraneo Estudios Avanzados, E-07122 Palma de Mallorca, Spain; Tech Univ Darmstadt, Inst Appl Phys, D-64289 Darmstadt, Germany; Univ Politecn Cataluna, Dept Fis & Engn Nucl, E-08222 Terrassa, Spain; Univ Illes Balears, Dept Fis, E-07122 Palma de Mallorca, Spain; Univ Cantabria, CSIC, Inst Fis Cantabria, E-39005 Santander, Spain; Univ Wales, Sch Informat, Bangor LL57 1UT, Gwynedd, Wales","Mirasso, CR (reprint author), Univ Illes Balears, Dept Fis, E-07122 Palma De Mallorca, Spain.",claudio@galiota.uib.es,"Colet, Pere/A-2472-2011; Garcia-Ojalvo, Jordi/A-4574-2009; Mirasso, Claudio/B-8661-2008; Fischer, Ingo/C-2843-2011; Argyris, Apostolos/G-1703-2016","Colet, Pere/0000-0002-5992-6292; Garcia-Ojalvo, Jordi/0000-0002-3716-7520; Fischer, Ingo/0000-0003-1881-9842; Argyris, Apostolos/0000-0003-2847-7719; Larger, Laurent/0000-0003-1245-1602",,,,24,776,820,1,83,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,17-Nov,2005,438,7066,,,,,343,346,,10.1038/nature04275,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,984JR,WOS:000233300200045,16292256,No,,,11/20/17

Regional patterns of warming-induced changes in surface hydroclimate are complex and less certain than those in temperature, however, with both regional increases and decreases expected in precipitation and runoff.

Stylophoran plates are constructed of a three-dimensional mesh, termed 'stereom', identical to that of living echinoderms in which stereom microstructure provides a reliable guide to the nature of the investing soft tissues(16-18). Using modern echinoderm anatomy to interpret stereom microstructure of stylophoran elements, here we show that the large proximal lumen of their appendage was filled with muscle and that ligamentary tissues bound distal elements firmly together. We find no evidence for a mouth in the proximal lumen and no evidence that the covering plates of the appendage were articulated.

A prominent example, central to our current understanding of epidemic spread, is the basic reproductive number, R-0, which is defined as the mean number of infections caused by an infected individual in a susceptible population(3,4). Population estimates of R-0 can obscure considerable individual variation in infectiousness, as highlighted during the global emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) by numerous 'superspreading events' in which certain individuals infected unusually large numbers of secondary cases(5-10). For diseases transmitted by non-sexual direct contacts, such as SARS or smallpox, individual variation is difficult to measure empirically, and thus its importance for outbreak dynamics has been unclear(2,10,11). Here we present an integrated theoretical and statistical analysis of the influence of individual variation in infectiousness on disease emergence. Using contact tracing data from eight directly transmitted diseases, we show that the distribution of individual infectiousness around R-0 is often highly skewed. Model predictions accounting for this variation differ sharply from average-based approaches, with disease extinction more likely and outbreaks rarer but more explosive. Using these models, we explore implications for outbreak control, showing that individual-specific control measures outperform population-wide measures. Moreover, the dramatic improvements achieved through targeted control policies emphasize the need to identify predictive correlates of higher infectiousness. Our findings indicate that superspreading is a normal feature of disease spread, and to frame ongoing discussion we propose a rigorous definition for superspreading events and a method to predict their frequency.","Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Environm Sci Policy & Management, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; Univ Calif Berkeley, Biophys Grad Grp, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; Coll William & Mary, Dept Math, Williamsburg, VA 23187 USA; Univ Hull, Ctr Math, Kingston Upon Hull HU6 7RX, N Humberside, England","Lloyd-Smith, JO (reprint author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Environm Sci Policy & Management, 140 Mulford Hall, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",jls@nature.berkeley.edu,"Lloyd-Smith, James/K-4080-2012","Lloyd-Smith, James/0000-0001-7941-502X; Getz, Wayne/0000-0001-8784-9354",,,,30,673,682,16,160,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,17-Nov,2005,438,7066,,,,,355,359,,10.1038/nature04153,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,984JR,WOS:000233300200048,16292310,No,,,11/20/17

It is well established that cellular diversification of neurons in the embryo is generated by position-dependent extrinsic signals and combinatorial interactions of transcription factors that direct specific cell fates by suppressing alternative fates(2). It is unknown whether a comparable process determines embryonic astrocyte identity. Indeed, astrocyte development is generally thought to take place in a position-independent manner(3,4). Here we show multiple functions of Stem cell leukaemia (Scl, also known as Tal1), which encodes a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor, in the regulation of both astrocyte versus oligodendrocyte cell fate acquisition and V2b versus V2a interneuron cell fate acquisition in the p2 domain of the developing vertebrate spinal cord. Our findings demonstrate a regionally restricted transcriptional programme necessary for astrocyte and V2b interneuron development, with striking parallels to the involvement of SCL in haematopoiesis.

This could be due to a carry-over effect of the X chromosome's passage through the male germ line, where it becomes transiently silenced together with the Y chromosome, during meiotic sex chromosome inactivation (MSCI)(2). Here we show that Xist (X inactive specific transcript) transgenes, located on autosomes, do not undergo MSCI in the male germ line of mice and yet can induce imprinted cis-inactivation when paternally inherited, with identical kinetics to the Xp chromosome. This suggests that MSCI is not necessary for imprinted X-chromosome inactivation in mice. We also show that the Xp is transcribed, like autosomes, at zygotic gene activation rather than being 'pre-inactivated'(3). We propose that expression of the paternal Xist gene at zygotic gene activation is sufficient to trigger cis-inactivation of the X chromosome, or of an autosome carrying a Xist transgene.","Inst Curie, CNRS, UMR 218, F-75248 Paris, France; Inst Pasteur, F-75015 Paris, France; Univ Amsterdam, Swammerdam Inst Life Sci, NL-1098 SM Amsterdam, Netherlands; Univ Washington, Dept Pathol, Seattle, WA 98195 USA","Heard, E (reprint author), Inst Curie, CNRS, UMR 218, 26 Rue Ulm, F-75248 Paris, France.",Edith.Heard@curie.fr,"Heard, Edith/D-7197-2017","Heard, Edith/0000-0001-8052-7117",,,,30,124,129,0,5,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,17-Nov,2005,438,7066,,,,,369,373,,10.1038/nature04155,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,984JR,WOS:000233300200051,16227973,No,,,11/20/17

Notably, Meisetz has catalytic activity for trimethylation, but not mono- or dimethylation, of lysine 4 of histone H3, and a transactivation activity that depends on its methylation activity. Mice in which the Meisetz gene is disrupted show sterility in both sexes due to severe impairment of the double-stranded break repair pathway, deficient pairing of homologous chromosomes and impaired sex body formation. In Meisetz-deficient testis, trimethylation of lysine 4 of histone H3 is attenuated and meiotic gene transcription is altered.

Eukaryotic cells repair DSBs by both non-homologous end joining and homologous recombination. How chromatin structure is altered in response to DSBs and how such alterations influence DSB repair processes are important issues. In vertebrates, phosphorylation of the histone variant H2A.X occurs rapidly after DSB formation(1), spreads over mega-base chromatin domains, and is required for stable accumulation of repair proteins at damage foci(2). In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, phosphorylation of the two principal H2A species is also signalled by DSB formation, which spreads similar to 40 kb in either direction from the DSB3. Here we show that near a DSB phosphorylation of H2A is followed by loss of histones H2B and H3 and increased sensitivity of chromatin to digestion by micrococcal nuclease; however, phosphorylation of H2A and nucleosome loss occur independently. The DNA damage sensor MRX4 is required for histone loss, which also depends on INO80, a nucleosome remodelling complex(5). The repair protein Rad51 (ref. 6) shows delayed recruitment to DSBs in the absence of histone loss, suggesting that MRX-dependent nucleosome remodelling regulates the accessibility of factors directly involved in DNA repair by homologous recombination. Thus, MRX may regulate two pathways of chromatin changes: nucleosome displacement for efficient recruitment of homologous recombination proteins; and phosphorylation of H2A, which modulates checkpoint responses to DNA damage(2).","Univ New Mexico, Sch Med, Dept Mol Genet & Microbiol, Albuquerque, NM 87131 USA","Osley, MA (reprint author), Univ New Mexico, Sch Med, Dept Mol Genet & Microbiol, 915 Camino de Salud, Albuquerque, NM 87131 USA.",mosley@salud.unm.edu,,,NCI NIH HHS [R01 CA055302]; NIGMS NIH HHS [R01 GM040118],,,30,292,299,2,21,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,17-Nov,2005,438,7066,,,,,379,383,,10.1038/nature04148,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,984JR,WOS:000233300200053,16292314,No,,,11/20/17

MTs bind motor enzymes that drive many such movements, but MT dynamics can also contribute to organelle motility(1-8). Each MT polymer is a store of chemical energy that can be used to do mechanical work, but how this energy is converted to motility remains unknown. Here we show, by conjugating glass microbeads to tubulin polymers through strong inert linkages, such as biotin-avidin, that depolymerizing MTs exert a brief tug on the beads, as measured with laser tweezers. Analysis of these interactions with a molecular-mechanical model of MT structure and force production(9,10) shows that a single depolymerizing MT can generate about ten times the force that is developed by a motor enzyme; thus, this mechanism might be the primary driving force for chromosome motion.

Because learning about food quality enhances survival, one of the most robust forms of olfactory learning is conditioned avoidance of tastes associated with visceral malaise. The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans feeds on bacteria but is susceptible to infection by pathogenic bacteria in its natural environment. Here we show that C. elegans modifies its olfactory preferences after exposure to pathogenic bacteria, avoiding odours from the pathogen and increasing its attraction to odours from familiar nonpathogenic bacteria. Particular bacteria elicit specific changes in olfactory preferences that are suggestive of associative learning. Exposure to pathogenic bacteria increases serotonin in ADF chemosensory neurons by transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms. Serotonin functions through MOD-1, a serotonin-gated chloride channel expressed in sensory interneurons, to promote aversive learning. An increase in serotonin may represent the negative reinforcing stimulus in pathogenic infection.","Rockefeller Univ, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Lab Neural Circuits & Behav, New York, NY 10021 USA","Bargmann, CI (reprint author), Rockefeller Univ, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Lab Neural Circuits & Behav, 1230 York Ave, New York, NY 10021 USA.",cori@rockefeller.edu,"Marion-Poll, Frederic/D-8882-2011","Marion-Poll, Frederic/0000-0001-6824-0180; Bargmann, Cornelia/0000-0002-8484-0618",,,,32,347,371,5,87,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,10-Nov,2005,438,7065,,,,,179,184,,10.1038/nature04216,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,982BV,WOS:000233133500039,16281027,No,,,11/20/17

These receptors are heteromeric ion channels that for activation require binding of glycine and glutamate to the NR1 and NR2 subunits, respectively. NMDA receptor function is characterized by slow channel opening and deactivation, and the resulting influx of cations initiates signal transduction cascades that are crucial to higher functions including learning and memory. Here we report crystal structures of the ligand-binding core of NR2A with glutamate and that of the NR1 - NR2A heterodimer with glutamate and glycine. The NR2A - glutamate complex defines the determinants of glutamate and NMDA recognition, and the NR1 - NR2A heterodimer suggests a mechanism for ligand-induced ion channel opening. Analysis of the heterodimer interface, together with biochemical and electrophysiological experiments, confirms that the NR1 - NR2A heterodimer is the functional unit in tetrameric NMDA receptors and that tyrosine 535 of NR1, located in the subunit interface, modulates the rate of ion channel deactivation.","Columbia Univ, Dept Biochem & Mol Biophys, New York, NY 10032 USA; Columbia Univ, Howard Hughes Med Inst, New York, NY 10032 USA","Gouaux, E (reprint author), Oregon Hlth & Sci Univ, Vollum Inst, Portland, OR 97239 USA.",jeg52@columbia.edu,,,,,,50,421,441,1,46,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,10-Nov,2005,438,7065,,,,,185,192,,10.1038/nature04089,,8,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,982BV,WOS:000233133500040,16281028,No,,,11/20/17

Jupiter's large thermal emission suggests that the winds are powered from within(3,4), but the zonal flow depth is limited by increasing density and electrical conductivity in the molecular hydrogen - helium atmosphere towards the centre of the planet(5). Two types of planetary flow models have been explored: shallow-layer models reproduce multiple high-latitude jets, but not the equatorial flow system(6-8), and deep convection models only reproduce an eastward equatorial jet with two flanking neighbours(9-14). Here we present a numerical model of three-dimensional rotating convection in a relatively thin spherical shell that generates both types of jets. The simulated flow is turbulent and quasi-two-dimensional and, as observed for the jovian jets, simulated jet widths follow Rhines' scaling theory(2,12,13,15). Our findings imply that Jupiter's latitudinal transition in jet width corresponds to a separation between the bottom-bounded flow structures in higher latitudes and the deep equatorial flows.","Univ Alberta, Dept Phys, Edmonton, AB T6G 2J1, Canada; Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Earth & Space Sci, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; Max Planck Inst Solar Syst Res, D-37191 Katlenburg Lindau, Germany","Heimpel, M (reprint author), Univ Alberta, Dept Phys, Edmonton, AB T6G 2J1, Canada.",mheimpel@phys.ualberta.ca,,,,,,30,106,106,2,16,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,10-Nov,2005,438,7065,,,,,193,196,,10.1038/nature04208,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,982BV,WOS:000233133500041,16281029,No,,,11/20/17

Here we report an experimental study of a condensed-matter system (graphene, a single atomic layer of carbon(6,7)) in which electron transport is essentially governed by Dirac's ( relativistic) equation. The charge carriers in graphene mimic relativistic particles with zero rest mass and have an effective 'speed of light' c* approximate to 10(6) m s(-1). Our study reveals a variety of unusual phenomena that are characteristic of two-dimensional Dirac fermions. In particular we have observed the following: first, graphene's conductivity never falls below a minimum value corresponding to the quantum unit of conductance, even when concentrations of charge carriers tend to zero; second, the integer quantum Hall effect in graphene is anomalous in that it occurs at half-integer filling factors; and third, the cyclotron mass m(c) of massless carriers in graphene is described by E = m(c)c(*)(2).

Graphene, consisting of an isolated single atomic layer of graphite, is an ideal realization of such a two-dimensional system. However, its behaviour is expected to differ markedly from the well-studied case of quantum wells in conventional semiconductor interfaces. This difference arises from the unique electronic properties of graphene, which exhibits electron - hole degeneracy and vanishing carrier mass near the point of charge neutrality(1,2). Indeed, a distinctive half-integer quantum Hall effect has been predicted(3-5) theoretically, as has the existence of a non-zero Berry's phase ( a geometric quantum phase) of the electron wavefunction - a consequence of the exceptional topology of the graphene band structure(6,7). Recent advances in micromechanical extraction and fabrication techniques for graphite structures(8-12) now permit such exotic two-dimensional electron systems to be probed experimentally. Here we report an experimental investigation of magneto-transport in a high-mobility single layer of graphene. Adjusting the chemical potential with the use of the electric field effect, we observe an unusual half-integer quantum Hall effect for both electron and hole carriers in graphene. The relevance of Berry's phase to these experiments is confirmed by magneto-oscillations. In addition to their purely scientific interest, these unusual quantum transport phenomena may lead to new applications in carbon-based electronic and magneto-electronic devices.","Columbia Univ, Dept Phys, New York, NY 10027 USA; Columbia Univ, Dept Appl Phys & Appl Math, New York, NY 10027 USA","Kim, P (reprint author), Columbia Univ, Dept Phys, 538 W 120th St, New York, NY 10027 USA.",pkim@phys.columbia.edu,"Kim, Philip/N-1886-2013",,,,,20,8108,8286,218,3144,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,10-Nov,2005,438,7065,,,,,201,204,,10.1038/nature04235,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,982BV,WOS:000233133500043,16281031,No,,,11/20/17

Yet their restricted occurrence, unusual abundance and nearly pure siliceous composition have never been satisfactorily explained by this hypothesis.

Various hypotheses have been suggested to explain these rapid temperature shifts, including internal oscillations in the climate system and external forcing, possibly from the Sun(7). But whereas pronounced solar cycles of similar to 87 and similar to 210 years are well known(8-12), a similar to 1,470-year solar cycle has not been detected(8). Here we show that an intermediate-complexity climate model with glacial climate conditions simulates rapid climate shifts similar to the Dansgaard - Oeschger events with a spacing of 1,470 years when forced by periodic freshwater input into the North Atlantic Ocean in cycles of, 87 and, 210 years. We attribute the robust 1,470-year response time to the superposition of the two shorter cycles, together with strongly nonlinear dynamics and the long characteristic timescale of the thermohaline circulation. For Holocene conditions, similar events do not occur. We conclude that the glacial 1,470-year climate cycles could have been triggered by solar forcing despite the absence of a 1,470-year solar cycle.","Univ Heidelberg, Inst Environm Phys, Heidelberg Acad Sci, D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany; Potsdam Inst Climate Impact Res, D-14412 Potsdam, Germany; Alfred Wegener Inst Polar & Marine Res, D-27570 Bremerhaven, Germany","Braun, H (reprint author), Univ Heidelberg, Inst Environm Phys, Heidelberg Acad Sci, Neuenheimer Feld 229, D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany.",holger.braun@iup.uni-heidelberg.de,"Christl, Marcus/J-4769-2016; Rahmstorf, Stefan/A-8465-2010; Ganopolski, Andrey/F-6811-2013","Christl, Marcus/0000-0002-3131-6652; Rahmstorf, Stefan/0000-0001-6786-7723; ",,,,30,128,134,6,37,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,10-Nov,2005,438,7065,,,,,208,211,,10.1038/nature04121,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,982BV,WOS:000233133500045,16281042,No,,,11/20/17

Multiple hypotheses concerning the nature of fault rupture have been proposed but no unifying theory has emerged(1-12). The conceptual hypothesis most commonly cited is the cascade model for fault rupture(1,3,10,13). In the cascade model, slip initiates on a small fault patch and continues to rupture further across a fault plane as long as the conditions are favourable. Two fundamental implications of this domino-like theory are that small earthquakes begin in the same manner as large earthquakes and that the rupture process is not deterministic - that is, the size of the earthquake cannot be determined until the cessation of rupture. Here we show that the frequency content of radiated seismic energy within the first few seconds of rupture scales with the final magnitude of the event. We infer that the magnitude of an earthquake can therefore be estimated before the rupture is complete. This finding implies that the rupture process is to some degree deterministic and has implications for the physics of the rupture process.","Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; Univ Wisconsin, Dept Geol & Geophys, Madison, WI 53706 USA","Allen, RM (reprint author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, 307 McCone Hall, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",rallen@berkeley.edu,,,,,,28,108,121,2,15,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,10-Nov,2005,438,7065,,,,,212,215,,10.1038/nature04214,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,982BV,WOS:000233133500046,16281033,No,,,11/20/17

Here we show, with the use of molecular phylogenetic data from one of the original bird families used to justify this assumption, that a diverse array of endemic island genera and species are the product of a single radiation that diversified across all major Pacific archipelagos in a non-stepping-stone fashion, and recently recolonized continental areas.

Here we estimate the rate at which mutation produces new variation in gene expression by measuring transcript abundances across the genome during the onset of metamorphosis in 12 initially identical Drosophila melanogaster lines that independently accumulated mutations for 200 generations(2). We find statistically significant mutational variation for 39% of the genome and a wide range of variability across corresponding genes. As genes are upregulated in development their variability decreases, and as they are downregulated it increases, indicating that developmental context affects the evolution of gene expression. A strong correlation between mutational variance and environmental variance shows that there is the potential for widespread canalization(3). By comparing the evolutionary rates that we report here with differences between species(4,5), we conclude that gene expression does not evolve according to strictly neutral models.

Cytopathological features of GAN include axonal degeneration, with accumulation and aggregation of cytoskeletal components(6-7). Little is currently known about the molecular mechanisms underlying this recessive disorder. Here we show that gigaxonin controls protein degradation, and is essential for neuronal function and survival. We present evidence that gigaxonin binds to the ubiquitin-activating enzyme E1 through its amino-terminal BTB domain, while the carboxy-terminal kelch repeat domain interacts directly with the light chain (LC) of microtubule-associated protein 1B (MAP1B)(8). Overexpression of gigaxonin leads to enhanced degradation of MAP1B-LC, which can be antagonized by proteasome inhibitors. Ablation of gigaxonin causes a substantial accumulation of MAP1B-LC in GAN-null neurons. Moreover, we show that overexpression of MAP1B in wild-type cortical neurons leads to cell death characteristic of GAN-null neurons, whereas reducing MAP1B levels significantly improves the survival rate of null neurons. Our results identify gigaxonin as a ubiquitin scaffolding protein that controls MAP1B-LC degradation, and provide insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying human neurodegenerative disorders.","Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Dept Neurol & Neurol Sci, Stanford, CA 94305 USA","Yang, YM (reprint author), Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Dept Neurol & Neurol Sci, 1201 Welch Rd, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",yyanmin@stanford.edu,,,,,,25,78,84,0,7,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,10-Nov,2005,438,7065,,,,,224,228,,10.1038/nature04256,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,982BV,WOS:000233133500049,16227972,No,,,11/20/17

Male-specific Fru protein is expressed in small groups of neurons scattered throughout the CNS of male, but not female, Drosophila(4,7). Collectively, these observations suggest that Fru 'masculinizes' certain neurons, thereby establishing neural substrates for male-typical behaviour. However, specific differences between neurons resulting from the presence or absence of Fru are unknown. Previous studies have suggested that Fru might result in sexual differences in the CNS at the functional level, as no overt sexual dimorphism in CNS structure was discernible(8-10). Here we identify a subset of fru-expressing interneurons in the brain that show marked sexual dimorphism in their number and projection pattern. We also demonstrate that Fru supports the development of neurons with male-specific dendritic fields, which are programmed to die during female development as a result of the absence of Fru. Thus, Fru expression can produce a male-specific neural circuit, probably used during heterosexual courtship, by preventing cell death in identifiable neurons.","Hokkaido Univ, Biol Lab, Iwamizawa 0688642, Japan; Waseda Univ, Adv Inst Sci & Engn, Tokyo 1698555, Japan; Tohoku Univ, Grad Sch Life Sci, Sendai, Miyagi 9808578, Japan","Kimura, KI (reprint author), Hokkaido Univ, Biol Lab, Iwamizawa Campus, Iwamizawa 0688642, Japan.",kimura@iwa.hokkyodai.ac.jp,,,,,,24,146,151,4,26,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,10-Nov,2005,438,7065,,,,,229,233,,10.1038/nature04229,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,982BV,WOS:000233133500050,16281036,No,,,11/20/17

For leg-to-wing transdetermination, the underlying mechanism involves morphogens such as Wingless that, when activated outside their normal context, induce ectopic expression of the wing-specific selector gene vestigial(2,3). Polycomb group (PcG) proteins maintain cellular fates by controlling the expression patterns of homeotic genes and other developmental regulators(4). Here we report that transdetermination events are coupled to PcG regulation. We show that the frequency of transdetermination is enhanced in PcG mutant flies. Downregulation of PcG function, as monitored by the reactivation of a silent PcG-regulated reporter gene, is observed in transdetermined cells. This downregulation is directly controlled by the Jun amino-terminal kinase (JNK) signalling pathway, which is activated in cells undergoing regeneration. Accordingly, transdetermination frequency is reduced in a JNK mutant background. This regulatory interaction also occurs in mammalian cells, indicating that the role of this signalling cascade in remodelling cellular fates may be conserved.","Univ Heidelberg, Ctr Mol Biol Heidelberg ZMBH, D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany","Paro, R (reprint author), Univ Heidelberg, Ctr Mol Biol Heidelberg ZMBH, D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany.",paro@zmbh.uni-heidelberg.de,,,,,,28,135,139,1,5,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,10-Nov,2005,438,7065,,,,,234,237,,10.1038/nature04120,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,982BV,WOS:000233133500051,16281037,No,,,11/20/17

Yet the rhythm- generating neural centres of higher eukaryotes are usually composed of interconnected cellular networks, which contribute to robustness and synchrony as well as other complex features of rhythmic behaviour(4-7). In mammals, little is known about how individual brain oscillators are organized to orchestrate a complex behavioural pattern. Drosophila is arguably more advanced from this point of view: we and others have recently shown that a group of adult brain clock neurons expresses the neuropeptide PDF8 and controls morning activity ( small LNv cells; M-cells), whereas another group of clock neurons controls evening activity (CRY+, PDF- cells; E-cells)(6,9). We have generated transgenic mosaic animals with different circadian periods in morning and evening cells. Here we show, by behavioural and molecular assays, that the six canonical groups of clock neurons(10) are organized into two separate neuronal circuits. One has no apparent effect on locomotor rhythmicity in darkness, but within the second circuit the molecular and behavioural timing of the evening cells is determined by morning-cell properties. This is due to a daily resetting signal from the morning to the evening cells, which run at their genetically programmed pace between consecutive signals. This neural circuit and oscillator-coupling mechanism ensures a proper relationship between the timing of morning and evening locomotor activity.","Brandeis Univ, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Waltham, MA 02454 USA; Brandeis Univ, Natl Ctr Behav Genom, Dept Biol, Waltham, MA 02454 USA","Rosbash, M (reprint author), Brandeis Univ, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Waltham, MA 02454 USA.",rosbash@brandeis.edu,,,NINDS NIH HHS [T32 NS007292],,,24,178,181,1,10,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,10-Nov,2005,438,7065,,,,,238,242,,10.1038/nature04192,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,982BV,WOS:000233133500052,16281038,No,,,11/20/17

How binding of the neurotransmitter is conveyed over the long distance to the channel remains a central question in neurobiology. Here we delineate a principal pathway that links neurotransmitter binding to channel gating by using a structural model of the Torpedo acetylcholine receptor at 4-angstrom resolution(1), recordings of currents through single receptor channels and determinations of energetic coupling between pairs of residues. We show that a pair of invariant arginine and glutamate residues in each receptor alpha-subunit electrostatically links peripheral and inner beta-sheets from the binding domain and positions them to engage with the channel. The key glutamate and flanking valine residues energetically couple to conserved proline and serine residues emerging from the top of the channel-forming alpha-helix, suggesting that this is the point at which the binding domain triggers opening of the channel. The series of interresidue couplings identified here constitutes a primary allosteric pathway that links neurotransmitter binding to channel gating.","Mayo Clin & Mayo Fdn, Coll Med, Dept Physiol & Biomed Engn, Receptor Biol Lab, Rochester, MN 55905 USA; Mayo Clin & Mayo Fdn, Coll Med, Mol Neurosci Grad Program, Rochester, MN 55905 USA","Sine, SM (reprint author), Mayo Clin & Mayo Fdn, Coll Med, Dept Physiol & Biomed Engn, Receptor Biol Lab, 200 1st St SW, Rochester, MN 55905 USA.",sine@mayo.edu,,,NINDS NIH HHS [R01 NS031744],,,30,197,198,1,9,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,10-Nov,2005,438,7065,,,,,243,247,,10.1038/nature04156,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,982BV,WOS:000233133500053,16281039,No,,,11/20/17

Neurotransmitter binding in these proteins triggers the opening (gating) of an ion channel by means of an as-yet-uncharacterized conformational change. Here we show that a specific proline ( Pro 8*), located at the apex of the loop between the second and third transmembrane helices (M2 - M3)(2,3), can link binding to gating through a cis-trans isomerization of the protein backbone. Using unnatural amino acid mutagenesis, a series of proline analogues with varying preference for the cis conformer was incorporated at the 8* position. Proline analogues that strongly favour the trans conformer produced nonfunctional channels. Among the functional mutants there was a strong correlation between the intrinsic cis - trans energy gap of the proline analogue and the activation of the channel, suggesting that cis - trans isomerization of this single proline provides the switch that interconverts the open and closed states of the channel. Consistent with this proposal, nuclear magnetic resonance studies on an M2 - M3 loop peptide reveal two distinct, structured forms. Our results thus confirm the structure of the M2 - M3 loop and the critical role of Pro 8* in the 5-HT3 receptor. In addition, they suggest that a molecular rearrangement at Pro 8* is the structural mechanism that opens the receptor pore.","CALTECH, Div Chem & Chem Engn, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA; Univ Cambridge, Dept Biochem, Cambridge CB2 1GA, England; CALTECH, Div Biol, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA","Dougherty, DA (reprint author), CALTECH, Div Chem & Chem Engn, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA.",dadougherty@caltech.edu,,"Broadhurst, Bill/0000-0002-0264-4593",Wellcome Trust,,,30,300,302,2,42,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,10-Nov,2005,438,7065,,,,,248,252,,10.1038/nature04130,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,982BV,WOS:000233133500054,16281040,No,,,11/20/17

The released telomerase is enzymatically active because it is able to lengthen a challenger oligonucleotide. In vivo, overexpression of Pif1p reduces telomerase association with telomeres, whereas depleting cells of Pif1p increases the levels of telomere-bound Est1p, a telomerase subunit that is present on the telomere when telomerase is active.

Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*)(4), an extremely compact radio source at the centre of our Galaxy, is the best candidate for proof(5-7), because it is the closest. Previous very-long-baseline interferometry observations ( at 7 mm wavelength) reported that Sgr A* is similar to 2 astronomical units (AU) in size(8), but this is still larger than the 'shadow' ( a remarkably dim inner region encircled by a bright ring) that should arise from general relativistic effects near the event horizon of the black hole(9). Moreover, the measured size is wavelength dependent(10). Here we report a radio image of Sgr A* at a wavelength of 3.5 mm, demonstrating that its size is similar to 1 AU. When combined with the lower limit on its mass(11), the lower limit on the mass density is 6.5 x 10(21) M-. pc(-3) (where M-. is the solar mass), which provides strong evidence that Sgr A* is a supermassive black hole.

Exploitation of slow light phenomena has potential for applications ranging from all-optical storage to all-optical switching(9,10). Existing schemes, however, are restricted to the narrow frequency range of the material resonance, which limits the operation frequency, maximum data rate and storage capacity(10). Moreover, the implementation of external lasers, low pressures and/or low temperatures prevents miniaturization and hinders practical applications. Here we experimentally demonstrate an over 300-fold reduction of the group velocity on a silicon chip via an ultra-compact photonic integrated circuit using low-loss silicon photonic crystal waveguides(11,12) that can support an optical mode with a submicrometre cross-section(13,14).

Here we study the urea - solvent interface at the nanometre scale and report kinetic Monte Carlo simulations of the micrometre- scale three-dimensional growth of urea crystals. These simulations accurately reproduce experimentally observed crystal growth. Unlike previous models of crystal growth(4-6), no assumption is made that the morphology can be constructed from the results for independently growing surfaces or from an a priori specification of surface defect concentration. This approach offers insights into the role of the solvent, the degree of supersaturation, and the contribution that extended defects ( such as screw dislocations) make to crystal growth. It also connects observations made at the nanometre scale, through in situ atomic force microscopy, with those made at the macroscopic level.

This pool is dynamic, and the transfer of genetic material between hosts and their phages(3-6) probably influences the genetic and functional diversity of both. For example, photosynthesis genes of cyanobacterial origin have been found in phages that infect Prochlorococcus(5,7) and Synechococcus(8,9), the numerically dominant phototrophs in ocean ecosystems. These genes include psbA, which encodes the photosystem II core reaction centre protein D1, and high-light-inducible ( hli) genes. Here we show that phage psbA and hli genes are expressed during infection of Prochlorococcus and are cotranscribed with essential phage capsid genes, and that the amount of phage D1 protein increases steadily over the infective period. We also show that the expression of host photosynthesis genes declines over the course of infection and that replication of the phage genome is a function of photosynthesis. We thus propose that the phage genes are functional in photosynthesis and that they may be increasing phage fitness by supplementing the host production of these proteins.","MIT, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Genet, Boston, MA 02115 USA; MIT, Dept Biol, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA","Chisholm, SW (reprint author), MIT, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",chisholm@mit.edu,"Johnson, Zackary/E-4601-2011","Johnson, Zackary/0000-0003-0793-8512; church, george/0000-0001-6232-9969",,,,29,226,243,6,59,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,3-Nov,2005,438,7064,,,,,86,89,,10.1038/nature04111,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,979XS,WOS:000232979000046,16222247,No,,,11/20/17

Plants do not contain cobalamin because they have no cobalamin-dependent enzymes. Deficiencies are therefore common in strict vegetarians(5), and in the elderly, who are susceptible to an autoimmune disorder that prevents its efficient uptake(6). In contrast, many algae are rich in vitamin B-12, with some species, such as Porphyra yezoensis (Nori), containing as much cobalamin as liver(7). Despite this, the role of the cofactor in algal metabolism remains unknown, as does the source of the vitamin for these organisms. A survey of 326 algal species revealed that 171 species require exogenous vitamin B-12 for growth, implying that more than half of the algal kingdom are cobalamin auxotrophs. Here we show that the role of vitamin B-12 in algal metabolism is primarily as a cofactor for vitamin B-12-dependent methionine synthase, and that cobalamin auxotrophy has arisen numerous times throughout evolution, probably owing to the loss of the vitamin B-12-independent form of the enzyme. The source of cobalamin seems to be bacteria, indicating an important and unsuspected symbiosis.","Univ Cambridge, Dept Plant Sci, Cambridge CB2 3EA, England; Univ Kent, Dept Biosci, Canterbury CT2 7NJ, Kent, England","Smith, AG (reprint author), Univ Cambridge, Dept Plant Sci, Cambridge CB2 3EA, England.",as25@cam.ac.uk,,"Smith, Alison/0000-0001-6511-5704",,,,28,356,375,8,134,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,3-Nov,2005,438,7064,,,,,90,93,,10.1038/nature04056,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,979XS,WOS:000232979000047,16267554,No,,,11/20/17

In addition to its well-known role in regulating gene expression through its DNA-binding domain, En-2 may also have a role in cell - cell communication, as suggested by the presence of other domains involved in nuclear export, secretion and internalization(3). Consistent with this possibility, here we report that an external gradient of En-2 protein strongly repels growth cones of Xenopus axons originating from the temporal retina and, conversely, attracts nasal axons. Fluorescently tagged En-2 accumulates inside growth cones within minutes of exposure, and a mutant form of the protein that cannot enter cells fails to elicit axon turning. Once internalized, En-2 stimulates the rapid phosphorylation of proteins involved in translation initiation and triggers the local synthesis of new proteins. Furthermore, the turning responses of both nasal and temporal growth cones in the presence of En-2 are blocked by inhibitors of protein synthesis. The differential guidance of nasal and temporal axons reported here suggests that En-2 may participate directly in topographic map formation in the vertebrate visual system.","Univ Cambridge, Dept Anat, Cambridge CB2 3DY, England; Ecole Normale Super, CNRS, UMR 8542, F-75230 Paris, France","Holt, C (reprint author), Univ Cambridge, Dept Anat, Downing St, Cambridge CB2 3DY, England.",prochian@biologie.ens.fr; ceh@mole.bio.cam.ac.uk,"Piper, Michael/B-2805-2010","Piper, Michael/0000-0002-6759-2560; Trembleau, Alain/0000-0002-8290-0795; Holt, Christine Elizabeth/0000-0003-2829-121X","Wellcome Trust [070568, ]",,,27,168,173,0,10,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,3-Nov,2005,438,7064,,,,,94,98,,10.1038/nature04110,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,979XS,WOS:000232979000048,16267555,No,,,11/20/17

In vitro, all three compounds inhibit infection of T cells and cervical tissue explants, and C52L acts synergistically with CMPD167 or BMS-378806 to inhibit infection of cell lines.

Therefore, it has been the focus of a considerable research initiative, involving the complete DNA sequencing of the genome(2), large-scale expression analyses(3,4), and protein characterization of its life-cycle stages(5). The Plasmodium genome sequence is relatively distant from those of most other eukaryotes, with more than 60% of the 5,334 encoded proteins lacking any notable sequence similarity to other organisms(2). To systematically elucidate functional relationships among these proteins, a large two-hybrid study has recently mapped a network of 2,846 interactions involving 1,312 proteins within Plasmodium6. This network adds to a growing collection of available interaction maps for a number of different organisms, and raises questions about whether the divergence of Plasmodium at the sequence level is reflected in the configuration of its protein network. Here we examine the degree of conservation between the Plasmodium protein network and those of model organisms. Although we find 29 highly connected protein complexes specific to the network of the pathogen, we find very little conservation with complexes observed in other organisms ( three in yeast, none in the others). Overall, the patterns of protein interaction in Plasmodium, like its genome sequence, set it apart from other species.","Univ Calif San Diego, Bioinformat Program, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Bioengn, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA","Suthram, S (reprint author), Univ Calif San Diego, Bioinformat Program, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.",ssuthram@ucsd.edu,,,"NIEHS NIH HHS [R01 ES014811, R01 ES014811-01A1]; NIGMS NIH HHS [R01 GM070743, R01 GM070743-01]",,,30,93,100,0,4,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,3-Nov,2005,438,7064,,,,,108,112,,10.1038/nature04135,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,979XS,WOS:000232979000051,16267557,No,,,11/20/17

The UPS influences most cellular processes, and its targets include transcriptional activators that are primary determinants of gene expression. Emerging evidence indicates that non-proteolytic functions of the UPS might stimulate transcriptional activity(2,3). Here we show that the proteolysis of some transcriptional activators by the UPS can stimulate their function. We focused on the role of UPS-dependent proteolysis in the function of inducible transcriptional activators in yeast, and found that inhibition of the proteasome(4) reduced transcription of the targets of the activators Gcn4, Gal4 and Ino2/4. In addition, mutations in SCFCdc4, the ubiquitin ligase for Gcn4 (ref. 5), or mutations in ubiquitin that prevent degradation(6), also impaired the transcription of Gcn4 targets. These transcriptional defects were manifested despite the enhanced abundance of Gcn4 on cognate promoters. Proteasome inhibition also decreased the association of RNA polymerase II with Gcn4, Gal4 and Ino2/4 targets, as did mutations in SCFCdc4 for Gcn4 targets. Expression of a stable phospho-site mutant of Gcn4 ( ref. 7) or disruption of the kinases that target Gcn4 for turnover(5,7) alleviated the sensitivity of Gcn4 activity to defects in the UPS.","CALTECH, Div Biol, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA","Deshaies, RJ (reprint author), CALTECH, Div Biol, Howard Hughes Med Inst, MC 156-29,1200 E Calif Blvd, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA.",deshaies@caltech.edu,"Deshaies, Raymond/B-8354-2014","Deshaies, Raymond/0000-0002-3671-9354",,,,27,138,143,0,5,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,3-Nov,2005,438,7064,,,,,113,116,,10.1038/nature04098,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,979XS,WOS:000232979000052,16267558,No,,,11/20/17

The concept of conformational substates has been described(6); however, the challenge is to unravel the intimate linkage between protein flexibility and enzymatic function. Here we show that the intrinsic plasticity of the protein is a key characteristic of catalysis. The dynamics of the prolyl cis - trans isomerase cyclophilin A ( CypA) in its substrate-free state and during catalysis were characterized with NMR relaxation experiments. The characteristic enzyme motions detected during catalysis are already present in the free enzyme with frequencies corresponding to the catalytic turnover rates. This correlation suggests that the protein motions necessary for catalysis are an intrinsic property of the enzyme and may even limit the overall turnover rate. Motion is localized not only to the active site but also to a wider dynamic network. Whereas coupled networks in proteins have been proposed previously(3,7-10), we experimentally measured the collective nature of motions with the use of mutant forms of CypA. We propose that the pre-existence of collective dynamics in enzymes before catalysis is a common feature of biocatalysts and that proteins have evolved under synergistic pressure between structure and dynamics.","Brandeis Univ, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Dept Biochem, Waltham, MA 02454 USA; Univ Toronto, Dept Med Genet, Toronto, ON M5S 1A8, Canada; Univ Toronto, Dept Biochem, Toronto, ON M5S 1A8, Canada; Univ Toronto, Dept Chem, Toronto, ON M5S 1A8, Canada; Florida State Univ, Natl High Magnet Field Lab, Tallahassee, FL 32310 USA","Kern, D (reprint author), Brandeis Univ, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Dept Biochem, Waltham, MA 02454 USA.",dkern@brandeis.edu,"Millet, Oscar/F-9696-2011","Labeikovsky, Wladimir/0000-0001-6074-3269",,,,30,685,695,23,183,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,3-Nov,2005,438,7064,,,,,117,121,,10.1038/nature04105,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,979XS,WOS:000232979000053,16267559,No,,,11/20/17

To elucidate the potential mode of action of these enzymes, here we developed a single-molecule fluorescence assay that can visualize DNA binding and translocation of Escherichia coli Rep, a superfamily 1 DNA helicase homologous to Saccharomyces cerevisiae Srs2. Individual Rep monomers were observed to move on single-stranded ( ss) DNA in the 30 to 50 direction using ATP hydrolysis. Strikingly, on hitting a blockade, such as duplex DNA or streptavidin, the protein abruptly snapped back close to its initial position, followed by further cycles of translocation and snapback. This repetitive shuttling is likely to be caused by a blockade-induced protein conformational change that enhances DNA affinity for the protein's secondary DNA binding site, thereby resulting in a transient DNA loop. Repetitive shuttling was also observed on ssDNA bounded by a stalled replication fork and an Okazaki fragment analogue, and the presence of Rep delayed formation of a filament of recombination protein RecA on ssDNA. Thus, the binding of a single Rep monomer to a stalled replication fork can lead to repetitive shuttling along the single-stranded region, possibly keeping the DNA clear of toxic recombination intermediates.","Univ Illinois, Dept Phys, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; Howard Hughes Med Inst, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; Washington Univ, Sch Med, Dept Biochem & Mol Biophys, St Louis, MO 63110 USA","Ha, T (reprint author), Univ Illinois, Dept Phys, 1110 W Green St, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.",tjha@uiuc.edu,"Ha, Taekjip/B-9506-2009; Joo, Chirlmin/B-9294-2008","Ha, Taekjip/0000-0003-2195-6258; Joo, Chirlmin/0000-0003-2803-0335","NIGMS NIH HHS [R01 GM045948, R01 GM065367]",,,34,177,178,3,30,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,27-Oct,2005,437,7063,,,,,1321,1325,,10.1038/nature04049,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,977UQ,WOS:000232829100045,16251956,No,,,11/20/17

The perturbing effect of the inner shepherding satellite, Prometheus, seems to introduce channels through the F ring and a 'streamer' - a line of particles that link the ring to the satellite. The detailed mechanism for the formation of these features has been lacking an explanation. Here we show that these phenomena can be understood in terms of a simple gravitational interaction as Prometheus approaches and recedes from the F ring every 14.7 hours. Our numerical models show that as Prometheus recedes from its closest approach to the F ring, it draws out ring material; one orbital period later, this affected region has undergone keplerian shear and is visible as a channel, in excellent agreement with structures seen in the Cassini images. Prometheus' periodic disruption of the F ring will become more pronounced as the two orbits approach their minimum separation in 2009. The model predicts that the appearance of streamers and the associated channels will vary in a regular fashion on a timescale of one orbital period.","Univ London, Queen Mary, Astron Unit, London E1 4NS, England; Cornell Univ, Dept Astron, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; Cornell Univ, Dept Theoret & Appl Mech, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; Space Sci Inst, Cassini Imaging Cent Lab Operat, Boulder, CO 80301 USA","Murray, CD (reprint author), Univ London, Queen Mary, Astron Unit, Mile End Rd, London E1 4NS, England.",C.D.Murray@qmul.ac.uk,,,,,,14,41,41,0,4,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,27-Oct,2005,437,7063,,,,,1326,1329,,10.1038/nature04212,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,977UQ,WOS:000232829100046,16251957,No,,,11/20/17

Of late there has been considerable interest in developing electronic devices based on the transport of spin that offer potential advantages in dissipation, size and speed over charge-based devices(1). However, these advantages bring with them additional complexity. Because each electron carries a single, fixed value (-e) of charge, the electrical current carried by a gas of electrons is simply proportional to its total momentum. A fundamental consequence is that the charge current is not affected by interactions that conserve total momentum, notably collisions among the electrons themselves(2). In contrast, the electron's spin along a given spatial direction can take on two values, +/-(h) over bar /2 (conventionally up arrow, down arrow), so that the spin current and momentum need not be proportional. Although the transport of spin polarization is not protected by momentum conservation, it has been widely assumed that, like the charge current, spin current is unaffected by electron - electron ( e - e) interactions. Here we demonstrate experimentally not only that this assumption is invalid, but also that over a broad range of temperature and electron density, the flow of spin polarization in a two-dimensional gas of electrons is controlled by the rate of e - e collisions.","Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Phys, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; Univ Calif Berkeley, Lawrence Berkeley Lab, Div Mat Sci, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; CALTECH, Arthur Amos Noyes Lab Chem Phys, Lab Mol Sci, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA; Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Ctr Spintron & Quantum Computat, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA","Weber, CP (reprint author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Phys, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",cpweber@lbl.gov,"Orenstein, Joseph/I-3451-2015; Moore, Joel/O-4959-2016","Moore, Joel/0000-0002-4294-5761",,,,18,157,158,2,43,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,27-Oct,2005,437,7063,,,,,1330,1333,,10.1038/nature04206,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,977UQ,WOS:000232829100047,16251958,No,,,11/20/17

Silicon-based optical modulators have recently been successfully demonstrated(2,3); but because the light modulation mechanisms in silicon(4) are relatively weak, long ( for example, several millimetres) devices(2) or sophisticated high-quality-factor resonators(3) have been necessary. Thin quantum-well structures made from III-V semiconductors such as GaAs, InP and their alloys exhibit the much stronger quantum-confined Stark effect (QCSE) mechanism(5), which allows modulator structures with only micrometres of optical path length(6,7). Such III-V materials are unfortunately difficult to integrate with silicon electronic devices. Germanium is routinely integrated with silicon in electronics(8), but previous silicon - germanium structures have also not shown strong modulation effects(9-13). Here we report the discovery of the QCSE, at room temperature, in thin germanium quantum-well structures grown on silicon. The QCSE here has strengths comparable to that in III-V materials. Its clarity and strength are particularly surprising because germanium is an indirect gap semiconductor; such semiconductors often display much weaker optical effects than direct gap materials ( such as the III-V materials typically used for optoelectronics). This discovery is very promising for small, high-speed(14), low-power(15-17) optical output devices fully compatible with silicon electronics manufacture.","Stanford Univ, Dept Elect Engn, Solid State & Photon Lab, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; Hewlett Packard Labs, Quantum Sci Res, Palo Alto, CA 94304 USA","Kuo, YH (reprint author), Stanford Univ, Dept Elect Engn, Solid State & Photon Lab, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",yhkuo@stanford.edu,"Miller, David/C-4829-2009","Miller, David/0000-0002-3633-7479",,,,28,490,496,10,95,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,27-Oct,2005,437,7063,,,,,1334,1336,,10.1038/nature04204,,3,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,977UQ,WOS:000232829100048,16251959,No,,,11/20/17

Such molecular motors convert light or chemical energy into directional rotary or linear motion(2-10), and are usually prepared and operated in solution. But if they are to be used as nanomachines that can do useful work, it seems essential to construct systems that can function on a surface, like a recently reported linear artificial muscle(11). Surface-mounted rotors have been realized and limited directionality in their motion predicted(12,13). Here we demonstrate that a light-driven molecular motor capable of repetitive unidirectional rotation(14) can be mounted on the surface of gold nanoparticles. The motor design(14) uses a chiral helical alkene with an upper half that serves as a propeller and is connected through a carbon - carbon double bond ( the rotation axis) to a lower half that serves as a stator. The stator carries two thiol-functionalized 'legs', which then bind the entire motor molecule to a gold surface. NMR spectroscopy reveals that two photo-induced cis-trans isomerizations of the central double bond, each followed by a thermal helix inversion to prevent reverse rotation, induce a full and unidirectional 3608 rotation of the propeller with respect to the surface-mounted lower half of the system.","Univ Groningen, Stratingh Inst, Dept Organ Chem, NL-9747 AG Groningen, Netherlands","Feringa, BL (reprint author), Univ Groningen, Stratingh Inst, Dept Organ Chem, Nijenborgh 4, NL-9747 AG Groningen, Netherlands.",B.L.Feringa@rug.nl,"Vicario, Javier/C-9893-2012; Feringa, Ben/C-1665-2013","Vicario, Javier/0000-0002-8976-0991; ",,,,21,311,311,15,171,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,27-Oct,2005,437,7063,,,,,1337,1340,,10.1038/nature04127,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,977UQ,WOS:000232829100049,16251960,No,,,11/20/17

Evidence for cooler episodes exists, particularly in the early Cretaceous period(6-8), but the timing and significance of these cool episodes are not well constrained. The seasonality of temperatures is important for constraining equator-to-pole temperature gradients and may indicate the presence of polar ice sheets; however, reconstructions of Cretaceous sea surface temperatures are predominantly based on the oxygen isotopic composition of planktonic foraminifera(1-4) that do not provide information about such intra-annual variations. Here we present intra-shell variations in delta O-18 values of rudist bivalves (Hippuritoidea) from palaeolatitudes between 8 degrees and 31 degrees N, which record the evolution of the seasonality of Cretaceous sea surface temperatures in detail. We find high maximum temperatures (, 35 to 37 degrees C) and relatively low seasonal variability (< 12 degrees C) between 20 degrees and 30 degrees N during the warmer Cretaceous episodes. In contrast, during the cooler episodes our data show seasonal sea surface temperature variability of up to 18 degrees C near 25 degrees N, comparable to the range found today.

Although simplistic(2), his result is interesting in the context of the dramatic cooling that took place after the putative Moon-forming giant impact, which contributed the final similar to 10 per cent of the Earth's mass(3,4). The rate of accretion and core segregation on Earth as deduced from the U - Pb system(5) is much slower than that obtained from Hf - W systematics(6-8), and implies substantial accretion after the Moon-forming impact, which occurred 45 +/- 5 Myr after the beginning of the Solar System. Here we propose an explanation for the two timescales(5,9). We suggest that the Hf - W timescale reflects the principal phase of core-formation before the giant impact. Crystallization of silicate perovskite in the lower mantle during this phase produced Fe3+, which was released during the giant impact(10), and this oxidation resulted in late segregation of sulphur-rich metal into which Pb dissolved readily, setting the younger U - Pb age of the Earth. Separation of the latter metal then occurred 30 +/- 10 Myr after the Moon-forming impact. Over this time span, in surprising agreement with Kelvin's result, the Earth cooled by about 4,000 K in returning from a fully molten to a partially crystalline state.","Univ Oxford, Dept Earth Sci, Oxford OX1 3PR, England; Univ Bristol, Dept Earth Sci, Bristol BS8 1RJ, Avon, England","Wood, BJ (reprint author), Macquarie Univ, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, N Ryde, NSW 2109, Australia.",bwood@els.mq.edu.au,"Wood, Bernard/E-8173-2010",,,,,33,72,73,1,34,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,27-Oct,2005,437,7063,,,,,1345,1348,,10.1038/nature04129,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,977UQ,WOS:000232829100051,16251962,No,,,11/20/17

To cope with the effects of environmental temperature fluctuations, endothermic birds and mammals maintain a relatively warm and constant body temperature, whereas most fishes and other vertebrates are ectothermic and conform to their thermal niche, compromising performance at colder temperatures(2,3). However, within the fishes the tunas and lamnid sharks deviate from the ectothermic strategy, maintaining elevated core body temperatures(4,5) that presumably confer physiological advantages for their roles as fast and continuously swimming pelagic predators. Here we show that the salmon shark, a lamnid inhabiting cold, north Pacific waters, has become so specialized for endothermy that its red, aerobic, locomotor muscles, which power continuous swimming, seem mammal-like, functioning only within a markedly elevated temperature range ( 20 - 30 degrees C). These muscles are ineffectual if exposed to the cool water temperatures, and when warmed even 10 degrees C above ambient they still produce only 25 - 50% of the power produced at 26 degrees C.

In the absence of gene flow, reproductive isolation arises gradually and incidentally as a result of mutation, genetic drift and the indirect effects of natural selection driving local adaptation(1-3). In contrast, speciation by reinforcement is driven directly by natural selection against maladaptive hybridization(1,4). This gives individuals that choose the traits of their own lineage greater fitness, potentially leading to rapid speciation between the lineages(1,4). Reinforcing natural selection on a population of one of the lineages in a mosaic contact zone could also result in divergence of the population from the allopatric range of its own lineage outside the zone(4-6). Here we test this with molecular data, experimental crosses, field measurements and mate choice experiments in a mosaic contact zone between two lineages of a rainforest frog. We show that reinforcing natural selection has resulted in significant premating isolation of a population in the contact zone not only from the other lineage but also, incidentally, from the closely related main range of its own lineage. Thus we show the potential for reinforcement to drive rapid allopatric speciation.","Univ Queensland, Sch Integrat Biol, St Lucia, Qld 4072, Australia; Queensland Parks & Wildlife Sci, Atherton, Qld 4883, Australia; Univ Calif Berkeley, Museum Vertebrate Zool, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA","Hoskin, CJ (reprint author), Univ Queensland, Sch Integrat Biol, St Lucia, Qld 4072, Australia.",c.hoskin@sib.uq.edu.au,"Higgie, Megan/A-6131-2008; Hoskin, Conrad/A-8407-2012; Moritz, Craig/A-7755-2012","Higgie, Megan/0000-0002-2397-0240; Hoskin, Conrad/0000-0001-8116-6085; ",,,,28,224,231,11,160,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,27-Oct,2005,437,7063,,,,,1353,1356,,10.1038/nature04004,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,977UQ,WOS:000232829100053,16251964,No,,,11/20/17

In contrast, cooperative behaviour in non-human primates is mainly limited to kin and reciprocating partners, and is virtually never extended to unfamiliar individuals(4). Here we present experimental tests of the existence of other-regarding preferences in non-human primates, and show that chimpanzees ( Pan troglodytes) do not take advantage of opportunities to deliver benefits to familiar individuals at no material cost to themselves, suggesting that chimpanzee behaviour is not motivated by other-regarding preferences. Chimpanzees are among the primates most likely to demonstrate prosocial behaviours. They participate in a variety of collective activities, including territorial patrols, coalitionary aggression, cooperative hunting, food sharing and joint mate guarding(5-12). Consolation of victims of aggression(13) and anecdotal accounts of solicitous treatment of injured individuals suggest that chimpanzees may feel empathy(14,15).

In some microbes, strict clonal reproduction predominates, as with the worldwide dissemination of Mycobacterium leprae, the cause of leprosy(1). In other pathogens, sexual reproduction yields clones with novel attributes, for example, enabling the efficient, oral transmission of the parasite Toxoplasma gondii(2). However, the roles of clonal or sexual propagation in the origins of many other microbial pathogen outbreaks remain unknown, like the recent fungal meningoencephalitis outbreak on Vancouver Island, Canada, caused by Cryptococcus gattii(3). Here we show that the C. gattii outbreak isolates comprise two distinct genotypes. The majority of isolates are hypervirulent and have an identical genotype that is unique to the Pacific Northwest. A minority of the isolates are significantly less virulent and share an identical genotype with fertile isolates from an Australian recombining population. Genotypic analysis reveals evidence of sexual reproduction, in which the majority genotype is the predicted offspring. However, instead of the classic a - alpha sexual cycle, the majority outbreak clone appears to have descended from two alpha mating-type parents. Analysis of nuclear content revealed a diploid environmental isolate homozygous for the major genotype, an intermediate produced during same-sex mating. These studies demonstrate how cryptic same-sex reproduction can enable expansion of a human pathogen to a new geographical niche and contribute to the ongoing production of infectious spores. This has implications for the emergence of other microbial pathogens and inbreeding in host range expansion in the fungal and other kingdoms.","Duke Univ, Med Ctr, Dept Mol Genet & Microbiol, Durham, NC 27710 USA; Duke Univ, Med Ctr, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Durham, NC 27710 USA; Duke Univ, Med Ctr, Dept Cell Biol, Durham, NC 27710 USA; Duke Univ, Med Ctr, Inst Genome Sci & Policy, Durham, NC 27710 USA; Duke Univ, Med Ctr, Dept Med, Durham, NC 27710 USA; Duke Univ, Med Ctr, Dept Pharmacol & Canc Biol, Durham, NC 27710 USA","Heitman, J (reprint author), Duke Univ, Med Ctr, Dept Mol Genet & Microbiol, Durham, NC 27710 USA.",heitm001@duke.edu,"Stajich, Jason/C-7297-2008; Fraser, James/B-4918-2012","Stajich, Jason/0000-0002-7591-0020; Fraser, James/0000-0001-5724-5285","NIAID NIH HHS [R01 AI039115, R01 AI050113]",,,30,325,340,7,51,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,27-Oct,2005,437,7063,,,,,1360,1364,,10.1038/nature04220,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,977UQ,WOS:000232829100055,16222245,No,,,11/20/17

In both regions, signals provided by the microenvironment regulate the maintenance, proliferation and neuronal fate commitment of the local stem cell population(1). The identity of these signals is largely unknown. Here we show that adult hippocampal stem/progenitor cells (AHPs) express receptors and signalling components for Wnt proteins, which are key regulators of neural stem cell behaviour in embryonic development(2). We also show that the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway is active and that Wnt3 is expressed in the hippocampal neurogenic niche. Overexpression of Wnt3 is sufficient to increase neurogenesis from AHPs in vitro and in vivo. By contrast, blockade of Wnt signalling reduces neurogenesis from AHPs in vitro and abolishes neurogenesis almost completely in vivo. Our data show that Wnt signalling is a principal regulator of adult hippocampal neurogenesis and provide evidence that Wnt proteins have a role in adult hippocampal function.","Salk Inst Biol Studies, Genet Lab, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; GSF Natl Res Ctr Environm & Hlth, Inst Dev Genet, D-85764 Neuherberg, Germany; Johns Hopkins Univ, Sch Med, Dept Neurol, Inst Cell Engn, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA; Johns Hopkins Univ, Sch Med, Dept Neurosci, Inst Cell Engn, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA","Gage, FH (reprint author), Salk Inst Biol Studies, Genet Lab, 10010 N Torrey Pines Rd, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA.",chichung.lie@gsf.de; gage@salk.edu,"Lie, Dieter Chichung/S-7914-2017",,Telethon [GFP01004],,,27,803,875,3,89,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,27-Oct,2005,437,7063,,,,,1370,1375,,10.1038/nature04108,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,977UQ,WOS:000232829100057,16251967,No,,,11/20/17

The conserved complex of Par3, Par6 and atypical protein kinase C5-8 phosphorylates and inactivates Lgl at the apical surface; however, the signalling mechanisms that coordinate cell polarization in development are not well defined. Here we show that a vertebrate homologue of Lgl associates with Dishevelled, an essential mediator of Wnt signalling, and that Dishevelled regulates the localization of Lgl in Xenopus ectoderm and Drosophila follicular epithelium. We show that both Lgl and Dsh are required for normal apical - basal polarity of Xenopus ectodermal cells. In addition, we show that the Wnt receptor Frizzled 8, but not Frizzled 7, causes Lgl to dissociate from the cortex with the concomitant loss of its activity in vivo. These findings suggest a molecular basis for the regulation of cell polarity by Frizzled and Dishevelled.","Mt Sinai Sch Med, Dept Mol Cell & Dev Biol, New York, NY 10029 USA","Sokol, SY (reprint author), Mt Sinai Sch Med, Dept Mol Cell & Dev Biol, Box 1020,1 Gustave L Levy Pl, New York, NY 10029 USA.",sergei.sokol@mssm.edu,,,,,,30,83,86,0,3,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,27-Oct,2005,437,7063,,,,,1376,1380,,10.1038/nature04116,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,977UQ,WOS:000232829100058,16251968,No,,,11/20/17

It comprises one catalytic 20S proteasome and two axially positioned 19S regulatory complexes(3). The 20S proteasome is composed of 28 subunits arranged in a cylindrical particle as four heteroheptameric rings, alpha(1-7)beta(1-7)beta(1-7)alpha(1-7) ( refs 4, 5), but the mechanism responsible for the assembly of such a complex structure remains elusive. Here we report two chaperones, designated proteasome assembling chaperone-1 (PAC1) and PAC2, that are involved in the maturation of mammalian 20S proteasomes. PAC1 and PAC2 associate as heterodimers with proteasome precursors and are degraded after formation of the 20S proteasome is completed. Overexpression of PAC1 or PAC2 accelerates the formation of precursor proteasomes, whereas knockdown by short interfering RNA impairs it, resulting in poor maturation of 20S proteasomes. Furthermore, the PAC complex provides a scaffold for alpha-ring formation and keeps the alpha-rings competent for the subsequent formation of half-proteasomes. Thus, our results identify a mechanism for the correct assembly of 20S proteasomes.","Tokyo Metropolitan Inst Med Sci, Lab Frontier Sci, Core Technol & Res Ctr, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo 1138613, Japan; Univ Copenhagen, Inst Mol Biol & Physiol, DK-2100 Copenhagen, Denmark; Natl Inst Adv Ind SCi & Technol, Biol Informat Res Ctr, Kohtoh Ku, Tokyo 1350064, Japan; Japan Sci & Technol Agcy, PRESTO, Kawaguchi, Saitama 3320012, Japan","Murata, S (reprint author), Tokyo Metropolitan Inst Med Sci, Lab Frontier Sci, Core Technol & Res Ctr, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo 1138613, Japan.",tanakak@rinshoken.or.jp; smurata@rinshoken.or.jp,"Murata, Shigeo/A-1426-2010","Murata, Shigeo/0000-0002-3177-3503",,,,23,136,147,0,3,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,27-Oct,2005,437,7063,,,,,1381,1385,,10.1038/nature04106,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,977UQ,WOS:000232829100059,16251969,No,,,11/20/17
