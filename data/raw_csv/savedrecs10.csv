This suggests that during the PWP, when global mean temperatures and atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations were similar to those projected for near-term climate change(2), ENSO variability-and related global climate teleconnections-could have been radically different from that today. Yet, owing to a lack of observational evidence on seasonal and interannual SST variability from crucial low-latitude sites, this fundamental climate characteristic of the PWP remains controversial(1,3-10). Here we show that permanent El Nino conditions did not exist during the PWP. Our spectral analysis of the delta(18)O SST and salinity proxy, extracted from two 35-year, monthly resolved PWP Porites corals in the Philippines, reveals variability that is similar to present ENSO variation. Although our fossil corals cannot be directly compared with modern ENSO records, two lines of evidence suggest that Philippine corals are appropriate ENSO proxies. First, delta(18)O anomalies from a nearby live Porites coral are correlated with modern records of ENSO variability. Second, negative-delta(18)O events in the fossil corals closely resemble the decreases in delta(18)O seen in the live coral during El Nino events. Prior research advocating a permanent El Nino state may have been limited by the coarse resolution of many SST proxies, whereas our coral-based analysis identifies climate variability at the temporal scale required to resolve ENSO structure firmly.","[Watanabe, Tsuyoshi; Minobe, Shoshiro; Kawashima, Tatsunori; Sowa, Kohki; Nagai, Takaya] Hokkaido Univ, Dept Nat Hist Sci, Fac Sci, Sapporo, Hokkaido 0600810, Japan; [Suzuki, Atsushi; Minoshima, Kayo] Natl Inst Adv Ind Sci & Technol, Geol Survey Japan, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058567, Japan; [Kameo, Koji] Chiba Univ, Dept Earth Sci, Fac Sci, Chiba 2638522, Japan; [Aguilar, Yolanda M.] Mines & Geosci Bur, Petrolab, Quezon City 1101, Philippines; [Wani, Ryoji] Yokohama Natl Univ, Interdisciplinary Res Ctr, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2408501, Japan; [Kawahata, Hodaka] Univ Tokyo, Atmosphere & Ocean Res Inst, Kashiwa, Chiba 2775564, Japan; [Kase, Tomoki] Natl Museum Nat & Sci, Dept Geol & Paleontol, Tokyo 1690073, Japan","Watanabe, T (reprint author), Hokkaido Univ, Dept Nat Hist Sci, Fac Sci, Sapporo, Hokkaido 0600810, Japan.",nabe@mail.sci.hokudai.ac.jp,"Watanabe, Tsuyoshi/A-5741-2012; Minobe, Shoshiro/E-2997-2010; Nagai, Takaya/C-3428-2011; Minoshima, Kaoru/G-1435-2013; kohki, sowa/D-2955-2011; KAWAHATA, HODAKA/F-9065-2016","Minobe, Shoshiro/0000-0002-9487-9006; KAWAHATA, HODAKA/0000-0003-4236-7356; Wani, Ryoji/0000-0002-3733-769X",,,,23,60,62,2,51,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,10-Mar,2011,471,7337,,,,,209,211,,10.1038/nature09777,,3,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,732FK,WOS:000288170200035,21390128,No,,,11/20/17

Recent whole-genome comparisons have made it possible to identify genes with elevated rates of amino acid change or divergent expression in humans, and non-coding sequences with accelerated base pair changes(2-5). Regulatory alterations may be particularly likely to produce phenotypic effects while preserving viability, and are known to underlie interesting evolutionary differences in other species(6-8). Here we identify molecular events particularly likely to produce significant regulatory changes in humans: complete deletion of sequences otherwise highly conserved between chimpanzees and other mammals. We confirm 510 such deletions in humans, which fall almost exclusively in non-coding regions and are enriched near genes involved in steroid hormone signalling and neural function. One deletion removes a sensory vibrissae and penile spine enhancer from the human androgen receptor (AR) gene, a molecular change correlated with anatomical loss of androgen-dependent sensory vibrissae and penile spines in the human lineage(9,10). Another deletion removes a forebrain subventricular zone enhancer near the tumour suppressor gene growth arrest and DNA-damage-inducible, gamma (GADD45G)(11,12), a loss correlated with expansion of specific brain regions in humans. Deletions of tissue-specific enhancers may thus accompany both loss and gain traits in the human lineage, and provide specific examples of the kinds of regulatory alterations(6-8) and inactivation events(13) long proposed to have an important role in human evolutionary divergence.","[McLean, Cory Y.; Wenger, Aaron M.; Bejerano, Gill] Stanford Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Reno, Philip L.; Pollen, Alex A.; Bassan, Abraham I.; Capellini, Terence D.; Guenther, Catherine; Indjeian, Vahan B.; Lim, Xinhong; Menke, Douglas B.; Schaar, Bruce T.; Bejerano, Gill; Kingsley, David M.] Stanford Univ, Dept Dev Biol, Sch Med, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Reno, Philip L.; Guenther, Catherine; Indjeian, Vahan B.; Menke, Douglas B.; Kingsley, David M.] Stanford Univ, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Sch Med, Stanford, CA 94305 USA","Bejerano, G (reprint author), Stanford Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",bejerano@stanford.edu; kingsley@stanford.edu,"Capellini, Terence/B-8316-2016","McLean, Cory/0000-0001-9928-8216; Reno, Philip/0000-0002-7053-0344","Bio-X graduate fellowship; Ruth L.

A notable exception is coeliac disease, where genetically susceptible individuals expressing human leukocyte antigen (HLA) HLA-DQ2 or HLA-DQ8 molecules develop inflammatory T-cell and antibody responses against dietary gluten, a protein present in wheat(3). The mechanisms underlying this dysregulated mucosal immune response to a soluble antigen have not been identified. Retinoic acid, a metabolite of vitamin A, has been shown to have a critical role in the induction of intestinal regulatory responses(4-6). Here we find in mice that in conjunction with IL-15, a cytokine greatly upregulated in the gut of coeliac disease patients(3,7), retinoic acid rapidly activates dendritic cells to induce JNK (also known as MAPK8) phosphorylation and release the proinflammatory cytokines IL-12p70 and IL-23. As a result, in a stressed intestinal environment, retinoic acid acted as an adjuvant that promoted rather than prevented inflammatory cellular and humoral responses to fed antigen. Altogether, these findings reveal an unexpected role for retinoic acid and IL-15 in the abrogation of tolerance to dietary antigens.","[DePaolo, R.

Congenital long QT syndrome (LQTS) is a familial arrhythmogenic syndrome characterized by abnormal ion channel function and sudden cardiac death(5-7). Here we report the development of a patient/disease-specific human iPSC line from a patient with type-2 LQTS (which is due to the A614V missense mutation in the KCNH2 gene). The generated iPSCs were coaxed to differentiate into the cardiac lineage. Detailed whole-cell patch-clamp and extracellular multielectrode recordings revealed significant prolongation of the action-potential duration in LQTS human iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes (the characteristic LQTS phenotype) when compared to healthy control cells. Voltage-clamp studies confirmed that this action-potential-duration prolongation stems from a significant reduction of the cardiac potassium current I(Kr). Importantly, LQTS-derived cells also showed marked arrhythmogenicity, characterized by early-after depolarizations and triggered arrhythmias. We then used the LQTS human iPSC-derived cardiac-tissue model to evaluate the potency of existing and novel pharmacological agents that may either aggravate (potassium-channel blockers) or ameliorate (calcium-channel blockers, K(ATP)-channel openers and late sodium-channel blockers) the disease phenotype. Our study illustrates the ability of human iPSC technology to model the abnormal functional phenotype of an inherited cardiac disorder and to identify potential new therapeutic agents. As such, it represents a promising paradigm to study disease mechanisms, optimize patient care (personalized medicine), and aid in the development of new therapies.","[Itzhaki, Ilanit; Maizels, Leonid; Huber, Irit; Zwi-Dantsis, Limor; Caspi, Oren; Winterstern, Aaron; Feldman, Oren; Gepstein, Amira; Arbel, Gil; Gepstein, Lior] Technion Israel Inst Technol, Bruce Rappaport Fac Med, Sohnis Family Res Lab Cardiac Electrophysiol & Re, IL-31096 Haifa, Israel; [Hammerman, Haim; Boulos, Monther; Gepstein, Lior] Technion Israel Inst Technol, Bruce Rappaport Fac Med, Rambam Med Ctr, Dept Cardiol, IL-31096 Haifa, Israel","Gepstein, L (reprint author), Technion Israel Inst Technol, Bruce Rappaport Fac Med, Sohnis Family Res Lab Cardiac Electrophysiol & Re, POB9649, IL-31096 Haifa, Israel.",mdlior@techunix.technion.ac.il,"Gepstein, Lior/H-9458-2012",,Israel Science Foundation; Legacy Heritage Foundation [1225/09]; Yad Hanadiv Foundation; Lorry Lokey research fund; Nancy and Stephen Grand Philanthropic Fund,"This study was supported in part by the Israel Science Foundation and Legacy Heritage Foundation (no. 1225/09), by the Yad Hanadiv Foundation Bruno Award, by the Lorry Lokey research fund, and by the Nancy and Stephen Grand Philanthropic Fund.

To explore the effect of the Timothy syndrome mutation on the electrical activity and contraction of human cardiomyocytes, we reprogrammed human skin cells from Timothy syndrome patients to generate induced pluripotent stem cells, and differentiated these cells into cardiomyocytes. Electrophysiological recording and calcium (Ca(2+)) imaging studies of these cells revealed irregular contraction, excess Ca(2+) influx, prolonged action potentials, irregular electrical activity and abnormal calcium transients in ventricular-like cells. We found that roscovitine, a compound that increases the voltage-dependent inactivation of Ca(V)1.2 (refs 6-8), restored the electrical and Ca(2+) signalling properties of cardiomyocytes from Timothy syndrome patients.

Recent genome-wide profiling of structural DNA alterations in ALL have identified multiple submicroscopic somatic mutations targeting key cellular pathways(1,2), and have demonstrated substantial evolution in genetic alterations from diagnosis to relapse(3). However, DNA sequence mutations in ALL have not been analysed in detail. To identify novel mutations in relapsed ALL, we resequenced 300 genes in matched diagnosis and relapse samples from 23 patients with ALL. This identified 52 somatic non-synonymous mutations in 32 genes, many of which were novel, including the transcriptional coactivators CREBBP and NCOR1, the transcription factors ERG, SPI1, TCF4 and TCF7L2, components of the Ras signalling pathway, histone genes, genes involved in histone modification (CREBBP and CTCF), and genes previously shown(1,2) to be targets of recurring DNA copy number alteration in ALL. Analysis of an extended cohort of 71 diagnosis-relapse cases and 270 acute leukaemia cases that did not relapse found that 18.3% of relapse cases had sequence or deletion mutations of CREBBP, which encodes the transcriptional coactivator and histone acetyltransferase CREB-binding protein (CREBBP, also known as CBP)(4). The mutations were either present at diagnosis or acquired at relapse, and resulted in truncated alleles or deleterious substitutions in conserved residues of the histone acetyltransferase domain. Functionally, the mutations impaired histone acetylation and transcriptional regulation of CREBBP targets, including glucocorticoid responsive genes. Several mutations acquired at relapse were detected in subclones at diagnosis, suggesting that the mutations may confer resistance to therapy. These results extend the landscape of genetic alterations in leukaemia, and identify mutations targeting transcriptional and epigenetic regulation as a mechanism of resistance in ALL.","[Mullighan, Charles G.; Payne-Turner, Debbie; Phillips, Letha A.; Heatley, Sue L.; Holmfeldt, Linda; Collins-Underwood, J.

Lig3 is considered a key ligase during base excision repair because its stability depends upon its nuclear binding partner Xrcc1, a critical factor for this DNA repair pathway(2,3). Lig3 is also present in the mitochondria, where its role in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) maintenance is independent of Xrcc1 (ref. 4). However, the biological role of Lig3 is unclear as inactivation of murine Lig3 results in early embryonic lethality(5). Here we report that Lig3 is essential for mtDNA integrity but dispensable for nuclear DNA repair. Inactivation of Lig3 in the mouse nervous system resulted in mtDNA loss leading to profound mitochondrial dysfunction, disruption of cellular homeostasis and incapacitating ataxia. Similarly, inactivation of Lig3 in cardiac muscle resulted in mitochondrial dysfunction and defective heart-pump function leading to heart failure. However, Lig3 inactivation did not result in nuclear DNA repair deficiency, indicating essential DNA repair functions of Xrcc1 can occur in the absence of Lig3. Instead, we found that Lig1 was critical for DNA repair, but acted in a cooperative manner with Lig3. Additionally, Lig3 deficiency did not recapitulate the hallmark features of neural Xrcc1 inactivation such as DNA damage-induced cerebellar interneuron loss(6), further underscoring functional separation of these DNA repair factors. Therefore, our data reveal that the critical biological role of Lig3 is to maintain mtDNA integrity and not Xrcc1-dependent DNA repair.","[Gao, Yankun; Katyal, Sachin; Lee, Youngsoo; Zhao, Jingfeng; Russell, Helen R.; McKinnon, Peter J.] St Jude Childrens Hosp, Dept Genet, Memphis, TN 38105 USA; [Rehg, Jerold E.] St Jude Childrens Hosp, Dept Pathol, Memphis, TN 38105 USA","McKinnon, PJ (reprint author), St Jude Childrens Hosp, Dept Genet, Memphis, TN 38105 USA.",peter.mckinnon@stjude.org,,"Katyal, Sachin/0000-0002-7790-4054","National Institutes of Health [NS-37956, CA-21765]; Cancer Center [P30 CA21765]; American Lebanese and Syrian Associated Charities of St Jude Children's Research Hospital","We thank the Hartwell Center for biotechnology support, the Transgenic Core Facility for blastocyst injections and the Animal Resources Center for animal husbandry.

Homologues of ligase I (Lig1) and ligase IV (Lig4) are ubiquitous in Eukarya, whereas ligase III (Lig3), which has nuclear and mitochondrial forms, appears to be restricted to vertebrates. Lig3 is implicated in various DNA repair pathways with its partner protein Xrcc1 (ref. 1). Deletion of Lig3 results in early embryonic lethality in mice, as well as apparent cellular lethality(2), which has precluded definitive characterization of Lig3 function. Here we used pre-emptive complementation to determine the viability requirement for Lig3 in mammalian cells and its requirement in DNA repair. Various forms of Lig3 were introduced stably into mouse embryonic stem (mES) cells containing a conditional allele of Lig3 that could be deleted with Cre recombinase. With this approach, we find that the mitochondrial, but not nuclear, Lig3 is required for cellular viability. Although the catalytic function of Lig3 is required, the zinc finger (ZnF) and BRCA1 carboxy (C)-terminal-related (BRCT) domains of Lig3 are not. Remarkably, the viability requirement for Lig3 can be circumvented by targeting Lig1 to the mitochondria or expressing Chlorella virus DNA ligase, the minimal eukaryal nick-sealing enzyme(3), or Escherichia coli LigA, an NAD(+)-dependent ligase(1). Lig3-null cells are not sensitive to several DNA-damaging agents that sensitize Xrcc1-deficient cells(4-6). Our results establish a role for Lig3 in mitochondria, but distinguish it from its interacting protein Xrcc1.","[Simsek, Deniz; Artus, Jerome; Brunet, Erika; Hadjantonakis, Anna-Katerina; Jasin, Maria] Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Dev Biol Program, New York, NY 10065 USA; [Simsek, Deniz; Hadjantonakis, Anna-Katerina; Shuman, Stewart; Jasin, Maria] Weill Cornell Grad Sch Med Sci, New York, NY 10065 USA; [Furda, Amy; Van Houten, Bennett] Univ Pittsburgh, Sch Med, Dept Pharmacol & Chem Biol, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA; [Furda, Amy; Van Houten, Bennett] Univ Pittsburgh, Inst Canc, Hillman Canc Ctr, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA; [Gao, Yankun; McKinnon, Peter J.] St Jude Childrens Hosp, Dept Genet & Tumor Cell Biol, Memphis, TN 38105 USA; [Brunet, Erika] Museum Natl Hist Nat, F-75005 Paris, France; [Brunet, Erika] CNRS, UMR7196, F-75005 Paris, France; [Brunet, Erika] INSERM, U565, F-75005 Paris, France; [Shuman, Stewart] Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Program Mol Biol, New York, NY 10065 USA","Jasin, M (reprint author), Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Dev Biol Program, New York, NY 10065 USA.",m-jasin@ski.mskcc.org,"BRUNET, ERIKA/K-7154-2016; BRUNET, ERIKA/H-9297-2017","BRUNET, ERIKA/0000-0002-1726-4673; BRUNET, ERIKA/0000-0002-1726-4673; Hadjantonakis, Anna-Katerina/0000-0002-7580-5124","PA CURE; National Institutes of Health [ES019566, NS37956, CA21765, GM54668]","We thank K.

However, at certain DNA sequences, Pol II moves backwards, and such backtracking can arrest transcription. Arrested Pol II is reactivated by transcription factor IIS (TFIIS), which induces RNA cleavage that is required for cell viability(1). Pol II arrest and reactivation are involved in transcription through nucleosomes(2,3) and in promoter-proximal gene regulation(4-6). Here we present X-ray structures at 3.3 angstrom resolution of an arrested Saccharomyces cerevisiae Pol II complex with DNA and RNA, and of a reactivation intermediate that additionally contains TFIIS. In the arrested complex, eight nucleotides of backtracked RNA bind a conserved 'backtrack site' in the Pol II pore and funnel, trapping the active centre trigger loop and inhibiting mRNA elongation. In the reactivation intermediate, TFIIS locks the trigger loop away from backtracked RNA, displaces RNA from the backtrack site, and complements the polymerase active site with a basic and two acidic residues that may catalyse proton transfers during RNA cleavage. The active site is demarcated from the backtrack site by a 'gating tyrosine' residue that probably delimits backtracking. These results establish the structural basis of Pol II backtracking, arrest and reactivation, and provide a framework for analysing gene regulation during transcription elongation.","[Cheung, Alan C.

ATM and ATR mediate DNA damage checkpoints by sensing double-strand breaks and single-strand-DNA-RFA nucleofilaments, respectively. However, it is unclear how acetylation modulates the DNA damage response. Here we show that HDAC inhibition/ablation specifically counteracts yeast Mec1 (orthologue of human ATR) activation, double-strand-break processing and single-strand-DNA-RFA nucleofilament formation. Moreover, the recombination protein Sae2 (human CtIP) is acetylated and degraded after HDAC inhibition. Two HDACs, Hda1 and Rpd3, and one HAT, Gcn5, have key roles in these processes. We also find that HDAC inhibition triggers Sae2 degradation by promoting autophagy that affects the DNA damage sensitivity of hda1 and rpd3 mutants. Rapamycin, which stimulates autophagy by inhibiting Tor, also causes Sae2 degradation. We propose that Rpd3, Hda1 and Gcn5 control chromosome stability by coordinating the ATR checkpoint and double-strand-break processing with autophagy.","[Robert, Thomas; Vanoli, Fabio; Chiolo, Irene; Shubassi, Ghadeer; Foiani, Marco] Fdn IFOM, I-20139 Milan, Italy; [Chiolo, Irene] LBNL, Dept Genome Biol, Berkeley, CA 94710 USA; [Bernstein, Kara A.; Rothstein, Rodney] Columbia Univ, Dept Genet & Dev, Med Ctr, New York, NY 10032 USA; [Botrugno, Oronza A.; Minucci, Saverio] European Inst Oncol, I-20139 Milan, Italy; [Parazzoli, Dario; Oldani, Amanda] Cogentech, I-20139 Milan, Italy; [Minucci, Saverio; Foiani, Marco] Univ Milan, DSBB, I-20139 Milan, Italy","Foiani, M (reprint author), Fdn IFOM, IFOM IEO Campus,Via Adamello 16, I-20139 Milan, Italy.",saverio.minucci@ifom-ieo-campus.it; marco.foiani@ifom-ieo-campus.it,"Bernstein, Kara/S-4943-2016; Botrugno, Oronza/P-2065-2017; Minucci, Saverio/J-9669-2012; Foiani, Marco/M-8234-2014","Bernstein, Kara/0000-0003-2247-6459; Botrugno, Oronza/0000-0002-2568-9815; Foiani, Marco/0000-0003-4795-834X",Italian Association for Cancer Research; Telethon; European Community (GENICA); Italian Ministry of Health; FRM; EMBO; HFSP; FIRC;  [GM50237];  [GM67055];  [GM088413],"We thank S.

Following sunspot cycle 23, the Sun went into a prolonged minimum characterized by a very weak polar magnetic field(2,3) and an unusually large number of days without sunspots(4). Sunspots are strongly magnetized regions(5) generated by a dynamo mechanism(6) that recreates the solar polar field mediated through plasma flows(7). Here we report results from kinematic dynamo simulations which demonstrate that a fast meridional flow in the first half of a cycle, followed by a slower flow in the second half, reproduces both characteristics of the minimum of sunspot cycle 23. Our model predicts that, in general, very deep minima are associated with weak polar fields. Sunspots govern the solar radiative energy(8,9) and radio flux, and, in conjunction with the polar field, modulate the solar wind, the heliospheric open flux and, consequently, the cosmic ray flux at Earth(3,10,11).","[Nandy, Dibyendu] Indian Inst Sci Educ & Res, Dept Phys Sci, Mohanpur 741252, W Bengal, India; [Munoz-Jaramillo, Andres; Martens, Petrus C.

Such a machine could have far-reaching applications in the simulation of many-body quantum physics in condensed-matter, chemical and high-energy systems. Part of Feynman's challenge was met by Lloyd(2), who showed how to approximately decompose the time evolution operator of interacting quantum particles into a short sequence of elementary gates, suitable for operation on a quantum computer. However, this left open the problem of how to simulate the equilibrium and static properties of quantum systems. This requires the preparation of ground and Gibbs states on a quantum computer. For classical systems, this problem is solved by the ubiquitous Metropolis algorithm(3), a method that has basically acquired a monopoly on the simulation of interacting particles. Here we demonstrate how to implement a quantum version of the Metropolis algorithm. This algorithm permits sampling directly from the eigenstates of the Hamiltonian, and thus evades the sign problem present in classical simulations.

The supporting evidence includes reconstructed air temperatures in Antarctica that are nearly in phase with boreal summer insolation and out of phase with local summer insolation(3-5). Antarctic climate is therefore thought to be driven by northern summer insolation(5). A clear mechanism that links the two hemispheres on orbital timescales is, however, missing. We propose that key Antarctic temperature records derived from ice cores are biased towards austral winter because of a seasonal cycle in snow accumulation. Using present-day estimates of this bias in the 'recorder' system, here we show that the local insolation can explain the orbital component of the temperature record without having to invoke a link to the Northern Hemisphere. Therefore, the Antarctic ice-core-derived temperature record, one of the best-dated records of the late Pleistocene temperature evolution, cannot be used to support or contradict the Milankovitch hypothesis that global climate changes are driven by Northern Hemisphere summer insolation variations.","[Laepple, Thomas; Werner, Martin; Lohmann, Gerrit] Alfred Wegener Inst Polar & Marine Res, Bremerhaven, Germany","Laepple, T (reprint author), Alfred Wegener Inst Polar & Marine Res, Bremerhaven, Germany.",thomas.laepple@awi.de,"Laepple, Thomas/M-8783-2015; Werner, Martin/C-8067-2014","Laepple, Thomas/0000-0001-8108-7520; Werner, Martin/0000-0002-6473-0243; Lohmann, Gerrit/0000-0003-2089-733X",,,,32,34,35,1,22,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,3-Mar,2011,471,7336,,,,,91,94,,10.1038/nature09825,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,729BY,WOS:000287924100040,21368830,No,,,11/20/17

Defects in DNA damage response factors such as ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) protein and combined deficiencies in classical non-homologous end joining and p53 predispose to RAG-initiated genomic rearrangements and lymphomagenesis(2-11). Although we showed previously that RAG1/RAG2 shepherd the broken DNA ends to classical non-homologous end joining for proper repair(12,13), roles for the RAG proteins in preserving genomic stability remain poorly defined. Here we show that the RAG2 carboxy (C) terminus, although dispensable for recombination(14,15), is critical for maintaining genomic stability. Thymocytes from 'core' Rag2 homozygotes (Rag2(c/c) mice) show dramatic disruption of Tcr alpha/delta locus integrity. Furthermore, all Rag2(c/c) p53(-/-) mice, unlike Rag1(c/c) p53(-/-) and p53(-/-) animals, rapidly develop thymic lymphomas bearing complex chromosomal translocations, amplifications and deletions involving the Tcra/delta and Igh loci. We also find these features in lymphomas from Atm(-/-) mice. We show that, like ATM-deficiency(3), core RAG2 severely destabilizes the RAG post-cleavage complex. These results reveal a novel genome guardian role for RAG2 and suggest that similar 'end release/end persistence' mechanisms underlie genomic instability and lymphomagenesis in Rag2(c/c) p53(-/-) and Atm(-/-) mice.","[Deriano, Ludovic; Chaumeil, Julie; Coussens, Marc; Chou, Yifan; Skok, Jane A.; Roth, David B.] NYU, Sch Med, Dept Pathol, New York, NY 10016 USA; [Multani, Asha] Univ Texas MD Anderson Canc Ctr, Dept Genet, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Alekseyenko, Alexander V.] NYU, Sch Med, Ctr Hlth Informat & Bioinformat, Div Clin Pharmacol,Dept Med, New York, NY 10016 USA; [Chang, Sandy] Yale Univ, Sch Med, Dept Lab Med, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Skok, Jane A.] UCL, Div Infect & Immun, Dept Immunol & Mol Pathol, London W1T 4JF, England","Roth, DB (reprint author), NYU, Sch Med, Dept Pathol, New York, NY 10016 USA.",david.roth@nyumc.org,,"Deriano, Ludovic/0000-0002-9673-9525; Alekseyenko, Alexander/0000-0002-5748-2085; Skok, Jane/0000-0002-4145-1516","National Institutes of Health Roadmap Initiative in Nanomedicine through a Nanomedicine Development Center [1PN2EY018244]; National Institutes of Health [CA104588, R01GM086852]; Irene Diamond Fund; National Center for Research Resources, National Institutes of Health [1UL1RR029893]; NCI [R01CA145746-01]; Leukemia and Lymphoma Scholar Award; Wellcome trust [085096]","We thank M.

There is a clear need to study whether the reprogramming process itself compromises genomic integrity and, through this, the efficiency of iPS cell establishment. Using a high-resolution single nucleotide polymorphism array, we compared copy number variations (CNVs) of different passages of human iPS cells with their fibroblast cell origins and with human embryonic stem (ES) cells. Here we show that significantly more CNVs are present in early-passage human iPS cells than intermediate passage human iPS cells, fibroblasts or human ES cells. Most CNVs are formed de novo and generate genetic mosaicism in early-passage human iPS cells. Most of these novel CNVs rendered the affected cells at a selective disadvantage. Remarkably, expansion of human iPS cells in culture selects rapidly against mutated cells, driving the lines towards a genetic state resembling human ES cells.","[Hussein, Samer M.; Vuoristo, Sanna; Hamalainen, Riikka; Olsson, Cia; Lundin, Karolina; Mikkola, Milla; Trokovic, Ras; Otonkoski, Timo] Univ Helsinki, Biomedicum Stem Cell Ctr, Res Program Unit, FI-00014 Helsinki, Finland; [Hussein, Samer M.; Sourour, Michel; Hamalainen, Riikka; Nagy, Andras] Samuel Lunenfeld Res Inst, Toronto, ON M5T 3H7, Canada; [Batada, Nizar N.; Ng, Siemon] Ontario Inst Canc Res, Toronto, ON M5G 0A3, Canada; [Ching, Reagan W.; Bazett-Jones, David P.] Hosp Sick Children, Dept Genet & Genome Biol, Toronto, ON M5G 1L7, Canada; [Autio, Reija; Narva, Elisa; Lahesmaa, Riitta] Univ Turku, Turku Ctr Biotechnol, FIN-20520 Turku, Finland; [Autio, Reija; Narva, Elisa; Lahesmaa, Riitta] Abo Akad Univ, FIN-20520 Turku, Finland; [Autio, Reija] Tampere Univ Technol, Dept Signal Proc, FIN-33101 Tampere, Finland; [Peitz, Michael; Bruestle, Oliver] Univ Bonn, Life & Brain Ctr, Inst Reconstruct Neurobiol, D-53127 Bonn, Germany; [Peitz, Michael; Bruestle, Oliver] Hertie Fdn, D-53127 Bonn, Germany; [Alitalo, Kari] Univ Helsinki, Lab Mol Canc Biol, FI-00014 Helsinki, Finland; [Alitalo, Kari] Univ Helsinki, Cent Hosp, FI-00014 Helsinki, Finland; [Nagy, Andras] Univ Toronto, Dept Mol Genet, Toronto, ON M5S 1A8, Canada; [Otonkoski, Timo] Univ Helsinki, Childrens Hosp, FI-00029 Helsinki, Finland","Otonkoski, T (reprint author), Univ Helsinki, Biomedicum Stem Cell Ctr, Res Program Unit, FI-00014 Helsinki, Finland.",nagy@lunenfeld.ca; timo.otonkoski@helsinki.fi,"Otonkoski, Timo/F-1189-2011; Nagy, Andras/G-6465-2013; Autio, Reija/D-2037-2014; Alitalo, Kari/J-5013-2014","Nagy, Andras/0000-0003-4311-0413; Alitalo, Kari/0000-0002-7331-0902; Trokovic, Ras/0000-0002-3065-6663",EU; Academy of Finland; Finnish Cancer Organizations; Helsinki University Hospital; Sigrid Juselius Foundation; Stem Cell Network Canada; GL2; CIHR; McEwen Centre for Regenerative Medicine; Ontario Institute for Cancer Research through the Ontario Ministry of Research and Innovation,"This work was supported by funding for the ESTOOLS consortium under the Sixth RFP of the EU (S.M.H., T.O., R.L. and O.B.), the Academy of Finland (T.O. and R.A.), the Finnish Cancer Organizations (R.L.), the Research Funds of the Helsinki University Hospital (T.O.), the Sigrid Juselius Foundation (T.O.), the Stem Cell Network Canada, GL2 and CIHR (A.N.).

Although DNA factors are integrated during some reprogramming methods, it is unknown whether the genome remains unchanged at the single nucleotide level. Here we show that 22 human induced pluripotent stem (hiPS) cell lines reprogrammed using five different methods each contained an average of five protein-coding point mutations in the regions sampled (an estimated six protein-coding point mutations per exome). The majority of these mutations were non-synonymous, nonsense or splice variants, and were enriched in genes mutated or having causative effects in cancers. At least half of these reprogramming-associated mutations pre-existed in fibroblast progenitors at low frequencies, whereas the rest occurred during or after reprogramming. Thus, hiPS cells acquire genetic modifications in addition to epigenetic modifications. Extensive genetic screening should become a standard procedure to ensure hiPS cell safety before clinical use.","[Young, Jessica E.; Canto, Isabel; Israel, Mason A.; Wilbert, Melissa L.; Goldstein, Lawrence S.

Somatic cell reprogramming involves epigenomic reconfiguration, conferring iPSCs with characteristics similar to embryonic stem (ES) cells. However, it remains unknown how complete the reestablishment of ES-cell-like DNA methylation patterns is throughout the genome. Here we report the first whole-genome profiles of DNA methylation at single-base resolution in five human iPSC lines, along with methylomes of ES cells, somatic cells, and differentiated iPSCs and ES cells. iPSCs show significant reprogramming variability, including somatic memory and aberrant reprogramming of DNA methylation. iPSCs share megabase-scale differentially methylated regions proximal to centromeres and telomeres that display incomplete reprogramming of non-CG methylation, and differences in CG methylation and histone modifications. Lastly, differentiation of iPSCs into trophoblast cells revealed that errors in reprogramming CG methylation are transmitted at a high frequency, providing an iPSC reprogramming signature that is maintained after differentiation.","[Lister, Ryan; Pelizzola, Mattia; Nery, Joseph R.; O'Malley, Ronan; Castanon, Rosa; Ecker, Joseph R.] Salk Inst Biol Studies, Genome Anal Lab, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; [Kida, Yasuyuki S.; Downes, Michael; Yu, Ruth; Evans, Ronald M.] Salk Inst Biol Studies, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Gene Express Lab, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; [Hawkins, R.

In condensed matter systems, SO coupling is crucial for the spin-Hall effect(1,2) and topological insulators(3-5); it contributes to the electronic properties of materials such as GaAs, and is important for spintronic devices(6). Quantum many-body systems of ultracold atoms can be precisely controlled experimentally, and would therefore seem to provide an ideal platform on which to study SO coupling. Although an atom's intrinsic SO coupling affects its electronic structure, it does not lead to coupling between the spin and the centre-of-mass motion of the atom. Here, we engineer SO coupling (with equal Rashba(7) and Dresselhaus(8) strengths) in a neutral atomic Bose-Einstein condensate by dressing two atomic spin states with a pair of lasers(9). Such coupling has not been realized previously for ultracold atomic gases, or indeed any bosonic system. Furthermore, in the presence of the laser coupling, the interactions between the two dressed atomic spin states are modified, driving a quantum phase transition from a spatially spin-mixed state (lasers off) to a phase-separated state (above a critical laser intensity). We develop a many-body theory that provides quantitative agreement with the observed location of the transition. The engineered SO coupling-equally applicable for bosons and fermions-sets the stage for the realization of topological insulators in fermionic neutral atom systems.","[Lin, Y. -J.; Jimenez-Garcia, K.; Spielman, I.

A robust annelid phylogeny would shape our understanding of animal body-plan evolution and shed light on the bilaterian ground pattern. Traditionally, Annelida has been split into two major groups: Clitellata (earthworms and leeches) and polychaetes (bristle worms), but recent evidence suggests that other taxa that were once considered to be separate phyla (Sipuncula, Echiura and Siboglinidae (also known as Pogonophora)) should be included in Annelida(1-4). However, the deep-level evolutionary relationships of Annelida are still poorly understood, and a robust reconstruction of annelid evolutionary history is needed. Here we show that phylogenomic analyses of 34 annelid taxa, using 47,953 amino acid positions, recovered a well-supported phylogeny with strong support for major splits. Our results recover chaetopterids, myzostomids and sipunculids in the basal part of the tree, although the position of Myzostomida remains uncertain owing to its long branch. The remaining taxa are split into two clades: Errantia (which includes the model annelid Platynereis), and Sedentaria (which includes Clitellata). Ancestral character trait reconstructions indicate that these clades show adaptation to either an errant or a sedentary lifestyle, with alteration of accompanying morphological traits such as peristaltic movement, parapodia and sensory perception. Finally, life history characters in Annelida seem to be phylogenetically informative.","[Struck, Torsten H.; Hoesel, Christoph; Purschke, Guenter] Univ Osnabruck, Biol Chem FB05, AG Zool, D-49069 Osnabruck, Germany; [Paul, Christiane; Tiedemann, Ralph; Bleidorn, Christoph] Univ Potsdam, Inst Biochem & Biol, Unit Evolutionary Biol Systemat Zool, D-14476 Potsdam, Germany; [Hill, Natascha; Hartmann, Stefanie] Univ Potsdam, Inst Biochem & Biol, Unit Bioinformat, D-14476 Potsdam, Germany; [Kube, Michael] Max Planck Inst Mol Genet, D-14195 Berlin, Germany; [Lieb, Bernhard; Meyer, Achim] Johannes Gutenberg Univ Mainz, Inst Zool, D-55099 Mainz, Germany; [Bleidorn, Christoph] Univ Leipzig, Inst Biol Mol Evolut & Systemat Anim 2, D-04103 Leipzig, Germany","Struck, TH (reprint author), Univ Osnabruck, Biol Chem FB05, AG Zool, Barbarastr 11, D-49069 Osnabruck, Germany.",struck@biologie.uni-osnabrueck.de; bleidorn@uni-leipzig.de,"Hartmann, Stefanie /H-4413-2011","Tiedemann, Ralph/0000-0002-2604-6336; Bleidorn, Christoph/0000-0001-7295-6616","marine biological stations in Bamfield; Helgoland; List and Roscoff for collection of annelids; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft [DFG-STR 683/5-2, DFG-Pu-84/5-1, DFG-TI-349/4-1, DFG Li 998/3-1, DFG-HA 5744/1-1, DFG-BL-787/2-1]","We are grateful to I.

It generally involves stretch-sensitive channels or conformational change of cytoskeleton-associated proteins(1). Mechanotransduction is crucial for the physiology of several organs and for cell migration(2,3). The extent to which mechanical inputs contribute to development, and how they do this, remains poorly defined. Here we show that a mechanotransduction pathway operates between the body-wall muscles of Caenorhabditis elegans and the epidermis. This pathway involves, in addition to a Rac GTPase, three signalling proteins found at the hemidesmosome: p21-activated kinase (PAK-1), the adaptor GIT-1 and its partner PIX-1. The phosphorylation of intermediate filaments is one output of this pathway. Tension exerted by adjacent muscles or externally exerted mechanical pressure maintains GIT-1 at hemidesmosomes and stimulates PAK-1 activity through PIX-1 and Rac. This pathway promotes the maturation of a hemidesmosome into a junction that can resist mechanical stress and contributes to coordinating the morphogenesis of epidermal and muscle tissues. Our findings suggest that the C. elegans hemidesmosome is not only an attachment structure, but also a mechanosensor that responds to tension by triggering signalling processes. We suggest that similar pathways could promote epithelial morphogenesis or wound healing in other organisms in which epithelial cells adhere to tension-generating contractile cells.","[Zhang, Huimin; Landmann, Frederic; Zahreddine, Hala; Rodriguez, David; Labouesse, Michel] Univ Strasbourg, Dev & Stem Cells Program, IGBMC, CNRS,INSERM,UMR7104,U964, F-67400 Illkirch Graffenstaden, France; [Koch, Marc] Univ Strasbourg, Imaging Ctr, IGBMC, CNRS,INSERM,UMR7104,U964, F-67400 Illkirch Graffenstaden, France","Labouesse, M (reprint author), Univ Strasbourg, Dev & Stem Cells Program, IGBMC, CNRS,INSERM,UMR7104,U964, 1 Rue Laurent Fries,BP 10142, F-67400 Illkirch Graffenstaden, France.",lmichel@igbmc.fr,,,ANR; ARC; EU; CNRS; INSERM,"We are grateful to H.-J.

Loss of FBW7, which encodes a tumour-suppressor protein, is frequently found in various types of human cancer, including breast cancer, colon cancer(1) and T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (T-ALL)(2). In line with these genomic data, engineered deletion of Fbw7 in mouse T cells results in T-ALL(3-5), validating FBW7 as a T-ALL tumour suppressor. Determining the precise molecular mechanisms by which FBW7 exerts antitumour activity is an area of intensive investigation. These mechanisms are thought to relate in part to FBW7-mediated destruction of key proteins relevant to cancer, including Jun(6), Myc(7), cyclin E-8 and notch 1 (ref. 9), all of which have oncoprotein activity and are overexpressed in various human cancers, including leukaemia. In addition to accelerating cell growth(10), overexpression of Jun, Myc or notch 1 can also induce programmed cell death(11). Thus, considerable uncertainty surrounds how FBW7-deficient cells evade cell death in the setting of upregulated Jun, Myc and/or notch 1. Here we show that the E3 ubiquitin ligase SCFFBW7 (a SKP1-cullin-1-F-box complex that contains FBW7 as the F-box protein) governs cellular apoptosis by targeting MCL1, a pro-survival BCL2 family member, for ubiquitylation and destruction in a manner that depends on phosphorylation by glycogen synthase kinase 3. Human T-ALL cell lines showed a close relationship between FBW7 loss and MCL1 overexpression. Correspondingly, T-ALL cell lines with defective FBW7 are particularly sensitive to the multi-kinase inhibitor sorafenib but resistant to the BCL2 antagonist ABT-737. On the genetic level, FBW7 reconstitution or MCL1 depletion restores sensitivity to ABT-737, establishing MCL1 as a therapeutically relevant bypass survival mechanism that enables FBW7-deficient cells to evade apoptosis. Therefore, our work provides insight into the molecular mechanism of direct tumour suppression by FBW7 and has implications for the targeted treatment of patients with FBW7-deficient T-ALL.","[Inuzuka, Hiroyuki; Shaik, Shavali; Gao, Daming; Tseng, Alan; Wan, Lixin; Lau, Alan W.; Wei, Wenyi] Harvard Univ, Beth Israel Deaconess Med Ctr, Sch Med, Dept Pathol, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Onoyama, Ichiro; Nakayama, Keiichi I.] Kyushu Univ, Dept Mol & Cellular Biol, Med Inst Bioregulat, Fukuoka 8128582, Japan; [Maser, Richard S.; Xiao, Yonghong; DePinho, Ronald A.] Harvard Univ, Belfer Inst Appl Canc Sci, Dana Farber Canc Inst, Dept Med Oncol,Sch Med, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Maser, Richard S.] Jackson Lab, Bar Harbor, ME 04609 USA; [Zhai, Bo; Gygi, Steven P.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Cell Biol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Gutierrez, Alejandro; Christie, Amanda L.; Kung, Andrew L.; Look, Thomas] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dana Farber Canc Inst, Dept Pediat Oncol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Christie, Amanda L.; Kung, Andrew L.] Dana Farber Canc Inst, Lurie Family Imaging Ctr, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Aster, Jon] Harvard Univ, Brigham & Womens Hosp, Sch Med, Dept Pathol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Settleman, Jeffrey] Harvard Univ, Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Sch Med, Ctr Canc,Dept Med, Boston, MA 02129 USA","Wei, WY (reprint author), Harvard Univ, Beth Israel Deaconess Med Ctr, Sch Med, Dept Pathol, 330 Brookline Ave, Boston, MA 02215 USA.",wwei2@bidmc.harvard.edu,"Maser, Richard/B-2970-2012; Wan, Lixin/F-2124-2011","Gutierrez, Alejandro/0000-0002-0249-9007; Kung, Andrew/0000-0002-9091-488X",Emerald Foundation; Leukemia and Lymphoma Society; National Institutes of Health [GM089763]; Robert A. and Renee E.

Microtubule-targeted agents such as Taxol and vincristine are prescribed widely for various malignancies, including ovarian and breast adenocarcinomas, non-small-cell lung cancer, leukaemias and lymphomas(1). These agents arrest cells in mitosis and subsequently induce cell death through poorly defined mechanisms(2). The strategies that resistant tumour cells use to evade death induced by antitubulin agents are also unclear(2). Here we show that the pro-survival protein MCL1 (ref. 3) is a crucial regulator of apoptosis triggered by antitubulin chemotherapeutics. During mitotic arrest, MCL1 protein levels decline markedly, through a post-translational mechanism, potentiating cell death. Phosphorylation of MCL1 directs its interaction with the tumour-suppressor protein FBW7, which is the substrate-binding component of a ubiquitin ligase complex. The polyubiquitylation of MCL1 then targets it for proteasomal degradation. The degradation of MCL1 was blocked in patient-derived tumour cells that lacked FBW7 or had loss-of-function mutations in FBW7, conferring resistance to antitubulin agents and promoting chemotherapeutic-induced polyploidy. Additionally, primary tumour samples were enriched for FBW7 inactivation and elevated MCL1 levels, underscoring the prominent roles of these proteins in oncogenesis. Our findings suggest that profiling the FBW7 and MCL1 status of tumours, in terms of protein levels, messenger RNA levels and genetic status, could be useful to predict the response of patients to antitubulin chemotherapeutics.","[Wertz, Ingrid E.; Kusam, Saritha; Lam, Cynthia; Helgason, Elizabeth; Ernst, James A.; Fairbrother, Wayne J.; Dueber, Erin C.] Genentech Inc, Dept Early Discovery Biochem, San Francisco, CA 94080 USA; [Okamoto, Toru; Huang, David C.

MSL (Male-specific lethal) complex increases transcription on the single X chromosome of Drosophila males to equalize expression of X-linked genes between the sexes(1). The biochemical mechanisms used for dosage compensation must function over a wide dynamic range of transcription levels and differential expression patterns. It has been proposed(2) that the MSL complex regulates transcriptional elongation to control dosage compensation, a model subsequently supported by mapping of the MSL complex and MSL-dependent histone 4 lysine 16 acetylation to the bodies of X-linked genes in males, with a bias towards 39 ends(3-7). However, experimental analysis of MSL function at the mechanistic level has been challenging owing to the small magnitude of the chromosome-wide effect and the lack of an in vitro system for biochemical analysis. Here we use global run-on sequencing (GRO-seq) 8 to examine the specific effect of the MSL complex on RNA Polymerase II (RNAP II) on a genome-wide level. Results indicate that the MSL complex enhances transcription by facilitating the progression of RNAP II across the bodies of active X-linked genes. Improving transcriptional output downstream of typical gene-specific controls may explain how dosage compensation can be imposed on the diverse set of genes along an entire chromosome.","[Larschan, Erica; Kuroda, Mitzi I.] Brigham & Womens Hosp, Dept Med, Div Genet, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Larschan, Erica; Kuroda, Mitzi I.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Genet, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Larschan, Erica] Brown Univ, Dept Mol Biol Cell Biol & Biochem, Providence, RI 02912 USA; [Bishop, Eric P.; Kharchenko, Peter V.; Park, Peter J.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Ctr Biomed Informat, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Bishop, Eric P.; Kharchenko, Peter V.; Park, Peter J.] Childrens Hosp, Informat Program, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Bishop, Eric P.] Boston Univ, Bioinformat Program, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Core, Leighton J.; Lis, John T.] Cornell Univ, Dept Mol Biol & Genet, Ithaca, NY 14850 USA","Kuroda, MI (reprint author), Brigham & Womens Hosp, Dept Med, Div Genet, 75 Francis St, Boston, MA 02115 USA.",peter_park@harvard.edu; mkuroda@genetics.med.harvard.edu,,,"NIH [GM45744, GM082798, HG4845]; Medical Foundation","We thank F.

Geometric frustration gives rise to new fundamental phenomena and is known to yield intriguing effects such as the formation of exotic states like spin ice, spin liquids and spin glasses(1-17). It has also led to interesting findings of fractional charge quantization and magnetic monopoles(5,6). Mechanisms related to geometric frustration have been proposed to understand the origins of relaxor and multiferroic behaviour, colossal magneto-capacitive coupling, and unusual and novel mechanisms of high-transition-temperature superconductivity(3-5,12,16). Although geometric frustration has been particularly well studied in magnetic systems in the past 20 years or so, its manifestation in the important class formed by ferroelectric materials (which are compounds with electric rather than magnetic dipoles) is basically unknown. Here we show, using a technique based on first principles, that compositionally graded ferroelectrics possess the characteristic 'fingerprints' associated with geometric frustration. These systems have a highly degenerate energy surface and display critical phenomena. They further reveal exotic orderings with novel stripe phases involving complex spatial organization. These stripes display spiral states, topological defects and curvature. Compositionally graded ferroelectrics can thus be considered the 'missing link' that brings ferroelectrics into the broad category of materials able to exhibit geometric frustration. Our ab initio calculations allow deep microscopic insight into this novel geometrically frustrated system.","[Choudhury, Narayani; Bellaiche, L.] Univ Arkansas, Dept Phys, Fayetteville, AR 72701 USA; [Walizer, Laura] Engineer Res & Dev Ctr, Vicksburg, MS 39180 USA; [Lisenkov, Sergey] Univ S Florida, Dept Phys, Tampa, FL 33620 USA","Choudhury, N (reprint author), Univ Arkansas, Dept Phys, Fayetteville, AR 72701 USA.",narayani@uark.edu,"Lisenkov, Sergey/C-4337-2012",,US National Science Foundation; Office of Naval Research; Department of Energy,"This work was supported by the US National Science Foundation, Office of Naval Research and Department of Energy.

This oscillation persists for minutes to weeks and is characterized by a remarkably narrow band of frequencies from about 0.5 Hz to 7 Hz (refs 1-4). Before major eruptions, tremor can occur in concert with increased gas flux and related ground deformation(5-7). Volcanic tremor is thus of particular value for eruption forecasting(6,8). Most models for volcanic tremor rely on specific properties of the geometry, structure and constitution of volcanic conduits as well as the gas content of the erupting magma. Because neither the initial structure nor the evolution of the magma-conduit system will be the same from one volcano to the next, it is surprising that tremor characteristics are so consistent among different volcanoes. Indeed, this universality of tremor properties remains a major enigma. Here we employ the contemporary view that silicic magma rises in the conduit as a columnar plug surrounded by a highly vesicular annulus of sheared bubbles(9,10). We demonstrate that, for most geologically relevant conditions, the magma column will oscillate or 'wag' against the restoring 'gas-spring' force of the annulus at observed tremor frequencies. In contrast to previous models, the magma-wagging oscillation is relatively insensitive to the conduit structure and geometry, which explains the narrow band of tremor frequencies observed around the world. Moreover, the model predicts that as an eruption proceeds there will be an upward drift in both the maximum frequency and the total signal frequency bandwidth, the nature of which depends on the explosivity of the eruption, as is often observed.","[Jellinek, A.

Lobopodians are a particularly interesting group that diversified and flourished in the Cambrian seas. Resembling 'worms with legs', they have long attracted much attention in that they may have given rise to both Onychophora (velvet worms)(4-6) and Tardigrada (water bears)(7,8), as well as to arthropods in general(9-12). Here we describe Diania cactiformis gen. et sp. nov. as an 'armoured' lobopodian from the Chengjiang fossil Lagerstatte (Cambrian Stage 3), Yunnan, southwestern China. Although sharing features with other typical lobopodians, it is remarkable for possessing robust and probably sclerotized appendages, with what appear to be articulated elements. In terms of limb morphology it is therefore closer to the arthropod condition, to our knowledge, than any lobopodian recorded until now. Phylogenetic analysis recovers it in a derived position, close to Arthropoda; thus, it seems to belong to a grade of organization close to the point of becoming a true arthropod. Further, D. cactiformis could imply that arthropodization (sclerotization of the limbs) preceded arthrodization (sclerotization of the body). Comparing our fossils with other lobopodian appendage morphologies-see Kerygmachela(9,10), Jianshanopodia(13) and Megadictyon(12)-reinforces the hypothesis that the group as a whole is paraphyletic, with different taxa expressing different grades of arthropodization.","[Liu, Jianni; Shu, Degan; Han, Jian; Zhang, Zhifei; Zhang, Xingliang] NW Univ Xian, Dept Geol, State Key Lab Continental Dynam, Early Life Inst, Xian 710069, Peoples R China; [Liu, Jianni; Steiner, Michael; Keupp, Helmut] Free Univ Berlin, Dept Earth Sci, D-12249 Berlin, Germany; [Dunlop, Jason A.] Humboldt Univ, Leibniz Inst Res Evolut & Biodivers, Museum Nat Kunde, D-10115 Berlin, Germany; [Shu, Degan; Ou, Qiang] China Univ Geosci, Sch Earth Sci & Resources, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China","Liu, JN (reprint author), NW Univ Xian, Dept Geol, State Key Lab Continental Dynam, Early Life Inst, Xian 710069, Peoples R China.",liujianni@126.com,,"Ou, Qiang/0000-0002-1142-5114; Han, Jian/0000-0002-2134-4078","Alexander von Humboldt Foundation at the Freie Universitat Berlin; National Science Foundation of China [40802011, 40830208]; State Key Laboratory of Continental Dynamics, Northwest University; DFG [Forschergruppe 736]","This work was supported by a Research Scholarship from the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation at the Freie Universitat Berlin, the National Science Foundation of China (grants 40802011 and 40830208) and the MOST Special Fund from the State Key Laboratory of Continental Dynamics, Northwest University (to J.L.), and a DFG grant within the Forschergruppe 736 (to H.

Impressive progress has been achieved in isolating quantum systems from the environment and coherently controlling their dynamics, as demonstrated by the creation and manipulation of entanglement in various physical systems. However, for open quantum systems, engineering the dynamics of many particles by a controlled coupling to an environment remains largely unexplored. Here we realize an experimental toolbox for simulating an open quantum system with up to five quantum bits (qubits). Using a quantum computing architecture with trapped ions, we combine multi-qubit gates with optical pumping to implement coherent operations and dissipative processes. We illustrate our ability to engineer the open-system dynamics through the dissipative preparation of entangled states, the simulation of coherent many-body spin interactions, and the quantum non-demolition measurement of multi-qubit observables. By adding controlled dissipation to coherent operations, this work offers novel prospects for open-system quantum simulation and computation.","[Mueller, Markus; Chwalla, Michael; Roos, Christian F.; Zoller, Peter; Blatt, Rainer] Austrian Acad Sci, Inst Quantenopt & Quanteninformat, A-6020 Innsbruck, Austria; [Barreiro, Julio T.; Schindler, Philipp; Nigg, Daniel; Monz, Thomas; Chwalla, Michael; Hennrich, Markus; Roos, Christian F.; Blatt, Rainer] Univ Innsbruck, Inst Expt Phys, A-6020 Innsbruck, Austria; [Mueller, Markus; Zoller, Peter] Univ Innsbruck, Inst Theoret Phys, A-6020 Innsbruck, Austria","Zoller, P (reprint author), Austrian Acad Sci, Inst Quantenopt & Quanteninformat, Technikerstr 21A, A-6020 Innsbruck, Austria.",Peter.Zoller@uibk.ac.at; Rainer.Blatt@uibk.ac.at,"Monz, Thomas/E-1285-2017; Schindler, Philipp/E-1485-2017; Roos, Christian/D-8475-2011; Hennrich, Markus/D-2475-2009; Muller, Markus/I-6530-2012; Zoller, Peter/O-1639-2014","Schindler, Philipp/0000-0002-9461-9650; Roos, Christian/0000-0001-7121-8259; Hennrich, Markus/0000-0003-2955-7980; Zoller, Peter/0000-0003-4014-1505; Muller, Markus/0000-0002-2813-3097",Austrian Science Fund; European Commission; Institut fur Quanteninformation GmbH; European Community,"We thank K.

In contrast, it is unclear if the PACAP-PAC1 receptor pathway has a role in human psychological stress responses, such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Here we find, in heavily traumatized subjects, a sex-specific association of PACAP blood levels with fear physiology, PTSD diagnosis and symptoms in females. We examined 44 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) spanning the PACAP (encoded by ADCYAP1) and PAC1 (encoded by ADCYAP1R1) genes, demonstrating a sex-specific association with PTSD. A single SNP in a putative oestrogen response element within ADCYAP1R1, rs2267735, predicts PTSD diagnosis and symptoms in females only. This SNP also associates with fear discrimination and with ADCYAP1R1 messenger RNA expression in human brain. Methylation of ADCYAP1R1 in peripheral blood is also associated with PTSD. Complementing these human data, ADCYAP1R1 mRNA is induced with fear conditioning or oestrogen replacement in rodent models. These data suggest that perturbations in the PACAP-PAC1 pathway are involved in abnormal stress responses underlying PTSD. These sex-specific effects may occur via oestrogen regulation of ADCYAP1R1. PACAP levels and ADCYAP1R1 SNPs may serve as useful biomarkers to further our mechanistic understanding of PTSD.","[Ressler, Kerry J.; Mercer, Kristina B.; Kerley, Kimberly] Howard Hughes Med Inst, Chevy Chase, MD 20815 USA; [Ressler, Kerry J.; Bradley, Bekh; Jovanovic, Tanja; Norrholm, Seth D.; Kilaru, Varun; Smith, Alicia K.; Binder, Elisabeth B.] Emory Univ, Sch Med, Dept Psychiat & Behav Sci, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA; [Bradley, Bekh; Norrholm, Seth D.] Atlanta VA Med Ctr, Atlanta, GA 30033 USA; [Ressler, Kerry J.; Mahan, Amy; Toufexis, Donna] Yerkes Natl Primate Res Ctr, Atlanta, GA 30329 USA; [Myers, Amanda J.; Ramirez, Manuel; Engel, Anzhelika] Univ Miami, Miller Sch Med, Miami, FL 33136 USA; [Hammack, Sayamwong E.; Toufexis, Donna] Univ Vermont, Dept Psychol, Burlington, VT 05401 USA; [Braas, Karen M.; May, Victor] Univ Vermont, Coll Med, Dept Anat & Neurobiol, Burlington, VT 05401 USA; [Braas, Karen M.; May, Victor] Univ Vermont, Coll Med, Dept Pharmacol, Burlington, VT 05401 USA; [Binder, Elisabeth B.] Max Planck Inst Psychiat, D-80804 Munich, Germany","Ressler, KJ (reprint author), Howard Hughes Med Inst, Chevy Chase, MD 20815 USA.",kressle@emory.edu,"Myers, Amanda/B-1796-2010; Bradley, Bekh/H-8399-2012; Binder, Elisabeth/K-8905-2014","Myers, Amanda/0000-0002-3100-9396; Ressler, Kerry/0000-0002-5158-1103","NIH [MH071537, DA019624, HD27468]; Emory and Grady Memorial Hospital General Clinical Research Center; NIH National Centers for Research Resources [M01RR00039, P20RR16435]; American Foundation for Suicide Prevention; Burroughs Wellcome Fund; National Institute on Aging [AG034504]","This work was primarily supported by NIH grant MH071537 (K.J.R.), as well as DA019624 (K.J.R.) and HD27468 (V.

The observation of Hoogsteen base pairs in DNA duplexes specifically bound to transcription factors and in damaged DNA sites implies that the DNA double helix intrinsically codes for excited state Hoogsteen base pairs as a means of expanding its structural complexity beyond that which can be achieved based on Watson-Crick base-pairing.

However, little is known about the intracellular mechanism that leads undifferentiated cells to adopt the neural fate in the absence of extrinsic inductive signals. Here we show that the zinc-finger nuclear protein Zfp521 is essential and sufficient for driving the intrinsic neural differentiation of mouse ES cells. In the absence of the neural differentiation inhibitor BMP4, strong Zfp521 expression is intrinsically induced in differentiating ES cells. Forced expression of Zfp521 enables the neural conversion of ES cells even in the presence of BMP4. Conversely, in differentiation culture, Zfp521-depleted ES cells do not undergo neural conversion but tend to halt at the epiblast state. Zfp521 directly activates early neural genes by working with the co-activator p300. Thus, the transition of ES cell differentiation from the epiblast state into neuroectodermal progenitors specifically depends on the cell-intrinsic expression and activator function of Zfp521.","[Kamiya, Daisuke; Banno, Satoe; Sasai, Noriaki; Ohgushi, Masatoshi; Inomata, Hidehiko; Watanabe, Kiichi; Kawada, Masako; Yakura, Rieko; Sasai, Yoshiki] RIKEN Ctr Dev Biol, Organogenesis & Neurogenesis Grp, Kobe, Hyogo 6500047, Japan; [Kamiya, Daisuke; Sasai, Yoshiki] Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Med, Dept Med Embryol, Kyoto 6068501, Japan; [Kiyonari, Hiroshi; Nakao, Kazuki] RIKEN Ctr Dev Biol, Lab Anim Resource & Genet Engn, Kobe, Hyogo 6500047, Japan; [Jakt, Lars Martin; Nishikawa, Shin-ichi] RIKEN Ctr Dev Biol, Lab Stem Cell Res, Kobe, Hyogo 6500047, Japan","Sasai, Y (reprint author), RIKEN Ctr Dev Biol, Organogenesis & Neurogenesis Grp, Kobe, Hyogo 6500047, Japan.",yoshikisasai@cdb.riken.jp,"Kiyonari, Hiroshi/N-7936-2015; Inomata, Hidehiko/N-7390-2015","Jakt, Lars Martin/0000-0002-3787-8138",MEXT; Kobe Cluster Project; Leading Project,"We are grateful to H.

These faint, submillimetre galaxies are challenging to study individually because of the relatively poor spatial resolution of far-infrared telescopes(5,6). Instead, their average properties can be studied using statistics such as the angular power spectrum of the background intensity variations(7-10). A previous attempt(11) at measuring this power spectrum resulted in the suggestion that the clustering amplitude is below the level computed with a simple ansatz based on a halo model(12). Here we report excess clustering over the linear prediction at arcminute angular scales in the power spectrum of brightness fluctuations at 250, 350 and 500 mu m. From this excess, we find that submillimetre galaxies are located in dark matter haloes with a minimum mass, M-min, such that log(10)[M-min/M-circle dot] = 11.5(-0.2)(+0.7) at 350 mu m, where M-circle dot is the solar mass. This minimum dark matter halo mass corresponds to the most efficient mass scale for star formation in the Universe(13), and is lower than that predicted by semi-analytical models for galaxy formation(14).","[Amblard, Alexandre; Cooray, Asantha; Serra, Paolo; Khostovan, A.

Multi-year droughts during the instrumental period(2) and decadal-length droughts of the past two millennia(1,3) were shorter and climatically different from the future permanent, 'dust-bowl-like' mega-drought conditions, lasting decades to a century, that are predicted as a consequence of warming(4). So far, it has been unclear whether or not such megadroughts occurred in the southwestern US, and, if so, with what regularity and intensity. Here we show that periods of aridity lasting centuries to millennia occurred in the southwestern US during mid-Pleistocene interglacials. Using molecular palaeo-temperature proxies(5) to reconstruct the mean annual temperature (MAT) in mid-Pleistocene lacustrine sediment from the Valles Caldera, New Mexico, we found that the driest conditions occurred during the warmest phases of interglacials, when the MAT was comparable to or higher than the modern MAT. A collapse of drought-tolerant C(4) plant communities during these warm, dry intervals indicates a significant reduction in summer precipitation, possibly in response to a poleward migration of the subtropical dry zone. Three MAT cycles similar to 2 degrees C in amplitude occurred within Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 11 and seem to correspond to the muted precessional cycles within this interglacial. In comparison with MIS 11, MIS 13 experienced higher precessional-cycle amplitudes, larger variations in MAT (4-6 degrees C) and a longer period of extended warmth, suggesting that local insolation variations were important to interglacial climatic variability in the southwestern US. Comparison of the early MIS 11 climate record with the Holocene record shows many similarities and implies that, in the absence of anthropogenic forcing, the region should be entering a cooler and wetter phase.","[Fawcett, Peter J.; Goff, Fraser; Donohoo-Hurley, Linda; Atudorei, Viorel; Geissman, John W.] Univ New Mexico, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, Albuquerque, NM 87131 USA; [Werne, Josef P.] Univ Minnesota, Dept Chem & Biochem, Duluth, MN 55812 USA; [Werne, Josef P.; Brown, Erik T.; Berke, Melissa A.] Univ Minnesota, Large Lakes Observ, Duluth, MN 55812 USA; [Brown, Erik T.; Berke, Melissa A.] Univ Minnesota, Dept Geol Sci, Duluth, MN 55812 USA; [Werne, Josef P.] Univ Western Australia, Ctr Water Res, Crawley, WA 6009, Australia; [Werne, Josef P.] Curtin Univ Technol, WA Organ & Isotope Geochem Ctr, Bentley, WA 6845, Australia; [Anderson, R.

If losses were not randomly distributed across the tree of life, climate change could lead to a disproportionate loss of evolutionary history(3-5). Here we estimate the consequences of climate change on the phylogenetic diversities of plant, bird and mammal assemblages across Europe. Using a consensus across ensembles of forecasts for 2020, 2050 and 2080 and high-resolution phylogenetic trees, we show that species vulnerability to climate change clusters weakly across phylogenies. Such phylogenetic signal in species vulnerabilities does not lead to higher loss of evolutionary history than expected with a model of random extinctions. This is because vulnerable species have neither fewer nor closer relatives than the remaining clades. Reductions in phylogenetic diversity will be greater in southern Europe, and gains are expected in regions of high latitude or altitude. However, losses will not be offset by gains and the tree of life faces a trend towards homogenization across the continent.","[Thuiller, Wilfried; Lavergne, Sebastien; Roquet, Cristina; Boulangeat, Isabelle; Lafourcade, Bruno] Univ Grenoble 1, Lab Ecol Alpine, CNRS, UMR 5553, FR-38041 Grenoble 9, France; [Araujo, Miguel.

Recent studies in monkeys indicate that neurons in the lateral habenula (LHb), a nucleus that mediates communication between forebrain and midbrain structures, can increase their activity when an animal fails to receive an expected positive reward or receives a stimulus that predicts aversive conditions (that is, disappointment or anticipation of a negative outcome)(2-4). LHb neurons project to, and modulate, dopamine-rich regions, such as the ventral tegmental area (VTA)(2,5), that control reward-seeking behaviour(6) and participate in depressive disorders(7). Here we show that in two learned helplessness models of depression, excitatory synapses onto LHb neurons projecting to the VTA are potentiated. Synaptic potentiation correlates with an animal's helplessness behaviour and is due to an enhanced presynaptic release probability. Depleting transmitter release by repeated electrical stimulation of LHb afferents, using a protocol that can be effective for patients who are depressed(8,9), markedly suppresses synaptic drive onto VTA-projecting LHb neurons in brain slices and can significantly reduce learned helplessness behaviour in rats. Our results indicate that increased presynaptic action onto LHb neurons contributes to the rodent learned helplessness model of depression.","[Li, Bo; Piriz, Joaquin; Chung, ChiHye; Proulx, Christophe D.; Malinow, Roberto] Univ Calif San Diego, Ctr Neural Circuits & Behav, Dept Neurosci, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Li, Bo; Piriz, Joaquin; Chung, ChiHye; Proulx, Christophe D.; Malinow, Roberto] Univ Calif San Diego, Ctr Neural Circuits & Behav, Dept Biol Sci, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Li, Bo; Mirrione, Martine; Henn, Fritz] Cold Spring Harbor Lab, Cold Spring Harbor, NY 11724 USA; [Mirrione, Martine; Schulz, Daniela; Henn, Fritz] Brookhaven Natl Lab, Upton, NY 11973 USA","Li, B (reprint author), Univ Calif San Diego, Ctr Neural Circuits & Behav, Dept Neurosci, 9500 Gilman Dr 0634, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.",bli@cshl.edu; rmalinow@ucsd.edu,"Schulz, Daniela/H-5625-2011","Piriz, Joaquin/0000-0002-4588-6568; Chung, ChiHye/0000-0002-3104-2399; Li, Bo/0000-0002-0154-3088","Dana Foundation; National Institute of Mental Health, National Institutes of Health [1R01MH091903-01]; Shiley-Marcos Endowment","We thank K.

Prion infections are typically associated with remarkably prolonged but highly consistent incubation periods followed by a rapid clinical phase. The relationship between prion propagation, generation of neurotoxic species and clinical onset has remained obscure. Prion incubation periods in experimental animals are known to vary inversely with expression level of cellular prion protein. Here we demonstrate that prion propagation in brain proceeds via two distinct phases: a clinically silent exponential phase not rate-limited by prion protein concentration which rapidly reaches a maximal prion titre, followed by a distinct switch to a plateau phase. The latter determines time to clinical onset in a manner inversely proportional to prion protein concentration. These findings demonstrate an uncoupling of infectivity and toxicity. We suggest that prions themselves are not neurotoxic but catalyse the formation of such species from PrPC. Production of neurotoxic species is triggered when prion propagation saturates, leading to a switch from autocatalytic production of infectivity (phase 1) to a toxic (phase 2) pathway.","[Sandberg, Malin K.; Al-Doujaily, Huda; Sharps, Bernadette; Clarke, Anthony R.; Collinge, John] UCL Inst Neurol, MRC Prion Unit, London WC1N 3BG, England; [Sandberg, Malin K.; Al-Doujaily, Huda; Sharps, Bernadette; Clarke, Anthony R.; Collinge, John] UCL Inst Neurol, Dept Neurodegenerat Dis, London WC1N 3BG, England","Collinge, J (reprint author), UCL Inst Neurol, MRC Prion Unit, Queen Sq, London WC1N 3BG, England.",j.collinge@prion.ucl.ac.uk,,,UK Medical Research Council,"This work was funded by the UK Medical Research Council.

The mechanisms by which they do so remain unclear, but emerging evidence indicates that they activate dendritic cells via Toll-like receptors (TLRs)(1,2). For example, the yellow fever vaccine YF-17D, one of the most successful empiric vaccines ever developed(3), activates dendritic cells via multiple TLRs to stimulate proinflammatory cytokines(4,5). Triggering specific combinations of TLRs in dendritic cells can induce synergistic production of cytokines(6), which results in enhanced T-cell responses, but its impact on antibody responses remain unknown. Learning the critical parameters of innate immunity that program such antibody responses remains a major challenge in vaccinology. Here we demonstrate that immunization of mice with synthetic nanoparticles containing antigens plus ligands that signal through TLR4 and TLR7 induces synergistic increases in antigen-specific, neutralizing antibodies compared to immunization with nanoparticles containing antigens plus a single TLR ligand. Consistent with this there was enhanced persistence of germinal centres and of plasma-cell responses, which persisted in the lymph nodes for >1.5 years. Surprisingly, there was no enhancement of the early short-lived plasma-cell response relative to that observed with single TLR ligands. Molecular profiling of activated B cells, isolated 7 days after immunization, indicated that there was early programming towards B-cell memory. Antibody responses were dependent on direct triggering of both TLRs on B cells and dendritic cells, as well as on T-cell help. Immunization protected completely against lethal avian and swine influenza virus strains in mice, and induced robust immunity against pandemic H1N1 influenza in rhesus macaques.","[Kasturi, Sudhir Pai; Skountzou, Ioanna; Hua, Tang; Nakaya, Helder I.; Ravindran, Rajesh; Kwissa, Marcin; Villinger, Francois; Jacob, Joshy; Compans, Richard; Pulendran, Bali] Emory Univ, Emory Vaccine Ctr, Atlanta, GA 30329 USA; [Kasturi, Sudhir Pai; Hua, Tang; Nakaya, Helder I.; Ravindran, Rajesh; Kwissa, Marcin; Villinger, Francois; Jacob, Joshy; Pulendran, Bali] Emory Univ, Yerkes Natl Primate Res Ctr, Atlanta, GA 30329 USA; [Skountzou, Ioanna; Koutsonanos, Dimitrios; Jacob, Joshy; Compans, Richard] Emory Univ, Dept Microbiol & Immunol, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA; [Albrecht, Randy A.; Steel, John; Garcia-Sastre, Adolfo] Mt Sinai Sch Med, Dept Microbiol, New York, NY 10029 USA; [Stewart, Shelley; Alam, Munir] Duke Univ, Med Ctr, Duke Human Vaccine Inst, Durham, NC USA; [Villinger, Francois; Pulendran, Bali] Emory Univ, Sch Med, Dept Pathol, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA; [Murthy, Niren] Georgia Inst Technol, Wallace H Coulter Dept Biomed Engn, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA; [Hogan, Robert J.] Univ Georgia, Dept Anat & Radiol, Coll Vet Med, Athens, GA 30602 USA; [Garcia-Sastre, Adolfo] Mt Sinai Sch Med, Div Infect Dis, Dept Med, New York, NY 10029 USA; [Garcia-Sastre, Adolfo] Mt Sinai Sch Med, Global Hlth & Emerging Pathogens Inst, New York, NY 10029 USA","Pulendran, B (reprint author), Emory Univ, Emory Vaccine Ctr, Atlanta, GA 30329 USA.",bpulend@emory.edu,"Nakaya, Helder/A-1397-2010; Compans, Richard/I-4087-2013; Skountzou, Ioanna/A-4454-2010","Nakaya, Helder/0000-0001-5297-9108; Compans, Richard/0000-0003-2360-335X; Skountzou, Ioanna/0000-0002-6429-244X; Garcia-Sastre, Adolfo/0000-0002-6551-1827; Albrecht, Randy/0000-0003-4008-503X","National Institutes of Health [U54AI057157, R37AI48638, R01DK057665, U19AI057266, HHSN266200700006C, NO1 AI50025, U19AI090023, HHSN266200700010C, U54AI57158, U01AI070469]; Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation","We thank R.

For instance, prostate cancer metastasis is associated with the infiltration of lymphocytes into advanced tumours and the upregulation of two tumour-necrosis-factor family members: receptor activator of nuclear factor-kappa B (RANK) ligand (RANKL) and lymphotoxin(2). But the source of RANKL and its role in metastasis have not been established. RANKL and its receptor RANK control the proliferation of mammary lobuloalveolar cells during pregnancy(3) through inhibitor of nuclear factor-kappa B (I kappa B) kinase-alpha (IKK-alpha)(4), a protein kinase that is needed for the self-renewal of mammary cancer progenitors(5) and for prostate cancer metastasis(2). We therefore examined whether RANKL, RANK and IKK-alpha are also involved in mammary/breast cancer metastasis. Indeed, RANK signalling in mammary carcinoma cells that overexpress the proto-oncogene Erbb2 (also known as Neu)(6), which is frequently amplified in metastatic human breast cancers(7,8), was important for pulmonary metastasis. Metastatic spread of Erbb2-transformed carcinoma cells also required CD4(+)CD25(+) T cells, whose major pro-metastatic function was RANKL production. Most RANKL-producing T cells expressed forkhead box P3 (FOXP3), a transcription factor produced by regulatory T cells, and were located next to smooth muscle actin (SMA)(+) stromal cells in mouse and human breast cancers. The dependence of pulmonary metastasis on T cells was replaceable by exogenous RANKL, which also stimulated pulmonary metastasis of RANK(+) human breast cancer cells. These results are consistent with the adverse impact of tumour-infiltrating CD4(+) or FOXP3(+) T cells on human breast cancer prognosis(9,10) and suggest that the targeting of RANKL-RANK can be used in conjunction with the therapeutic elimination of primary breast tumours to prevent recurrent metastatic disease.","[Tan, Wei; Zhang, Weizhou; Strasner, Amy; Grivennikov, Sergei; Karin, Michael] Univ Calif San Diego, Sch Med, Lab Gene Regulat & Signal Transduct, Dept Pharmacol, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Tan, Wei; Zhang, Weizhou; Strasner, Amy; Grivennikov, Sergei; Karin, Michael] Univ Calif San Diego, Sch Med, Lab Gene Regulat & Signal Transduct, Dept Pathol, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Cheng, Jin Q.] H Lee Moffitt Canc Ctr & Res Inst, Dept Mol Oncol, Tampa, FL 33612 USA; [Hoffman, Robert M.] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Surg, San Diego, CA 92103 USA; [Hoffman, Robert M.] AntiCancer Inc, San Diego, CA 92111 USA","Karin, M (reprint author), Univ Calif San Diego, Sch Med, Lab Gene Regulat & Signal Transduct, Dept Pharmacol, 9500 Gilman Dr,Mail Code 0723, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.",karinoffice@ucsd.edu,,,National Institutes of Health (NIH); Susan G.

To avoid head-on encounters, most genes, especially essential and highly transcribed genes, are encoded on the leading strand such that transcription and replication are co-directional. Virtually all bacteria have the highly expressed ribosomal RNA genes co-directional with replication(3). In bacteria, co-directional encounters seem inevitable because the rate of replication is about 10-20-fold greater than the rate of transcription. However, these encounters are generally thought to be benign(2,4-9). Biochemical analyses indicate that head-on encounters(10) are more deleterious than co-directional encounters(8) and that in both situations, replication resumes without the need for any auxiliary restart proteins, at least in vitro. Here we show that in vivo, co-directional transcription can disrupt replication, leading to the involvement of replication restart proteins. We found that highly transcribed rRNA genes are hotspots for co-directional conflicts between replication and transcription in rapidly growing Bacillus subtilis cells. We observed a transcription-dependent increase in association of the replicative helicase and replication restart proteins where head-on and co-directional conflicts occur. Our results indicate that there are co-directional conflicts between replication and transcription in vivo. Furthermore, in contrast to the findings in vitro, the replication restart machinery is involved in vivo in resolving potentially deleterious encounters due to head-on and co-directional conflicts. These conflicts probably occur in many organisms and at many chromosomal locations and help to explain the presence of important auxiliary proteins involved in replication restart and in helping to clear a path along the DNA for the replisome.","[Merrikh, Houra; Grossman, Alan D.] MIT, Dept Biol, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Machon, Cristina; Grainger, William H.; Soultanas, Panos] Univ Nottingham, Sch Chem, Ctr Biomol Sci, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England","Grossman, AD (reprint author), MIT, Dept Biol, Bldg 68-530, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",adg@mit.edu; Panos.Soultanas@nottingham.ac.uk,"Machon Sobrado, Cristina/K-1634-2014","Machon Sobrado, Cristina/0000-0001-5363-2958; Soultanas, Panos/0000-0003-3578-5699","Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council [BB/E006450/1]; Wellcome Trust [091968/Z/10/Z]; NIH [GM41934, GM093408]; Royal Society","We thank D.

The three parts are an inner membrane, substrate-binding transporter; a membrane fusion protein; and an outer-membrane-anchored channel. The fusion protein connects the transporter to the channel within the periplasmic space. A crystallographic model of this tripartite efflux complex has been unavailable because co-crystallization of the various components of the system has proven to be extremely difficult. We previously described the crystal structures of both the inner membrane transporter CusA(1) and the membrane fusion protein CusB(2) of the CusCBA efflux system(3,4) of E. coli. Here we report the co-crystal structure of the CusBA efflux complex, showing that the transporter (or pump) CusA, which is present as a trimer, interacts with six CusB protomers and that the periplasmic domain of CusA is involved in these interactions. The six CusB molecules seem to form a continuous channel. The affinity of the CusA and CusB interaction was found to be in the micromolar range. Finally, we have predicted a three-dimensional structure for the trimeric CusC outer membrane channel and developed a model of the tripartite efflux assemblage. This CusC(3)-CusB(6)-CusA(3) model shows a 750-kilodalton efflux complex that spans the entire bacterial cell envelope and exports Cu I and Ag I ions.","[Su, Chih-Chia; Long, Feng; Yu, Edward W.] Iowa State Univ, Dept Chem, Ames, IA 50011 USA; [Zimmermann, Michael T.; Jernigan, Robert L.; Yu, Edward W.] Iowa State Univ, Bioinformat & Computat Biol Interdept Grad Progra, Ames, IA 50011 USA; [Rajashankar, Kanagalaghatta R.] Cornell Univ, Argonne Natl Lab, Dept Chem & Chem Biol, Argonne, IL 60439 USA; [Rajashankar, Kanagalaghatta R.] Cornell Univ, Argonne Natl Lab, NE CAT, Argonne, IL 60439 USA; [Jernigan, Robert L.; Yu, Edward W.] Iowa State Univ, Dept Biochem Biophys & Mol Biol, Ames, IA 50011 USA; [Yu, Edward W.] Iowa State Univ, Dept Phys & Astron, Ames, IA 50011 USA","Yu, EW (reprint author), Iowa State Univ, Dept Chem, Ames, IA 50011 USA.",ewyu@iastate.edu,"Long, Feng/F-5475-2011; Jernigan, Robert/A-5421-2012","Long, Feng/0000-0001-6313-8558; Zimmermann, Michael/0000-0001-7073-0525","National Institutes of Health [R01GM074027, R01GM086431, R01GM081680, R01GM072014]; National Center for Research Resources at the National Institutes of Health [RR-15301]; US Department of Energy, Office of Basic Energy Sciences [DE-AC02-06CH11357]","This work is supported by National Institutes of Health grants R01GM074027 (E.W.Y.), R01GM086431 (E.W.Y.), R01GM081680 (R.L.J.) and R01GM072014 (R.L.J.).

The diameters of the broad-line regions range from a few light-days to more than a hundred light-days(1), and cannot be resolved spatially. The relative significance of inflow, outflow, rotational or turbulent motions in the broad-line regions as well as their structure (spherical, thin or thick accretion disk) are unknown despite intensive studies over more than thirty years(2,3). Here we report a fundamental relation between the observed emission linewidth full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) and the emission line shape FWHM/sigma(line) in AGN spectra. From this relation we infer that the predominant motion in the broad-line regions is Keplerian rotation in combination with turbulence. The geometry of the inner region varies systematically with the rotation velocity: it is flattest for the fast-rotating broad-line objects, whereas slow-rotating narrow-line AGN have a more spherical structure. Superimposed is the trend that the line-emitting region becomes geometrically thicker towards the centre within individual galaxies. Knowing the rotational velocities, we can derive the central black-hole masses more accurately; they are two to ten times smaller than has been estimated previously.","[Kollatschny, Wolfram; Zetzl, Matthias] Univ Gottingen, Inst Astrophys, D-37077 Gottingen, Germany","Kollatschny, W (reprint author), Univ Gottingen, Inst Astrophys, Friedrich Hund Pl 1, D-37077 Gottingen, Germany.",wkollat@astro.physik.uni-goettingen.de,,,Niedersachsen-Israel Research Cooperation Program [ZN2318],We acknowledge discussions with W.

While attention has been focused on transcriptional and post-translational mechanisms(1-3), other post-transcriptional modes have been less clearly delineated. Here we report mutants of a novel Drosophila gene twenty-four (tyf) that show weak behavioural rhythms. Weak rhythms are accompanied by marked reductions in the levels of the clock protein Period (PER) as well as more modest effects on Timeless (TIM). Nonetheless, PER induction in pacemaker neurons can rescue tyf mutant rhythms. TYF associates with a 5'-cap-binding complex, poly(A)-binding protein (PABP), as well as per and tim transcripts. Furthermore, TYF activates reporter expression when tethered to reporter messenger RNA even in vitro. Taken together, these data indicate that TYF potently activates PER translation in pacemaker neurons to sustain robust rhythms, revealing a new and important role for translational control in the Drosophila circadian clock.","[Lim, Chunghun; Kilman, Valerie L.; Allada, Ravi] Northwestern Univ, Dept Neurobiol & Physiol, Evanston, IL 60208 USA; [Lee, Jongbin; Choi, Changtaek; Kim, Juwon; Choe, Joonho] Korea Adv Inst Sci & Technol, Dept Biol Sci, Taejon 305701, South Korea; [Park, Sung Mi; Jang, Sung Key] Pohang Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Life Sci, Pohang 790784, South Korea","Allada, R (reprint author), Northwestern Univ, Dept Neurobiol & Physiol, 2153 Sheridan Rd, Evanston, IL 60208 USA.",r-allada@northwestern.edu; jchoe@kaist.ac.kr,"Choe, Joonho/F-3066-2011","Lim, Chunghun/0000-0001-8473-9272","Ministry of Education, Science and Technology, the Republic of Korea; National Institutes of Health [R01NS059042, R01NS052903, R01MH067870]","We thank I.

Evidence from invertebrates shows that this process is regulated by proteins asymmetrically distributed at the cell cortex during mitosis: Par3-Par6-aPKC, which confer polarity, and G alpha(i)-LGN/AGS3-NuMA-dynein/dynactin, which govern spindle positioning. Here we focus on developing mouse skin, where progenitor cells execute a switch from symmetric to predominantly asymmetric divisions concomitant with stratification. Using in vivo skin-specific lentiviral RNA interference, we investigate spindle orientation regulation and provide direct evidence that LGN (also called Gpsm2), NuMA and dynactin (Dctn1) are involved. In compromising asymmetric cell divisions, we uncover profound defects in stratification, differentiation and barrier formation, and implicate Notch signalling as an important effector. Our study demonstrates the efficacy of applying RNA interference in vivo to mammalian systems, and the ease of uncovering complex genetic interactions, here to gain insights into how changes in spindle orientation are coupled to establishing proper tissue architecture during skin development.","[Williams, Scott E.; Beronja, Slobodan; Pasolli, H.

The broader adverse impact of telomere dysfunction across many tissues including more quiescent systems prompted transcriptomic network analyses to identify common mechanisms operative in haematopoietic stem cells, heart and liver. These unbiased studies revealed profound repression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma, coactivator 1 alpha and beta (PGC-1 alpha and PGC-1 beta, also known as Ppargc1a and Ppargc1b, respectively) and the downstream network in mice null for either telomerase reverse transcriptase (Tert) or telomerase RNA component (Terc) genes. Consistent with PGCs as master regulators of mitochondrial physiology and metabolism, telomere dysfunction is associated with impaired mitochondrial biogenesis and function, decreased gluconeogenesis, cardiomyopathy, and increased reactive oxygen species. In the setting of telomere dysfunction, enforced Tert or PGC-1a expression or germline deletion of p53 (also known as Trp53) substantially restores PGC network expression, mitochondrial respiration, cardiac function and gluconeogenesis. We demonstrate that telomere dysfunction activates p53 which in turn binds and represses PGC-1 alpha and PGC-1 beta promoters, thereby forging a direct link between telomere and mitochondrial biology. We propose that this telomere-p53-PGC axis contributes to organ and metabolic failure and to diminishing organismal fitness in the setting of telomere dysfunction.","[Sahin, Erguen; Colla, Simona; Mueller, Florian L.; Maser, Richard S.; Tonon, Giovanni; Foerster, Friedrich; Xiong, Robert; Wang, Y.

The range of various structured artificial 'atoms' has promised a vast variety of otherwise unexpected physical phenomena(3-17), among which the experimental realization of a negative refractive index has been one of the main foci thus far. Expanding the refractive index into a high positive regime will complete the spectrum of achievable refractive index and provide more design flexibility for transformation optics(9-14). Naturally existing transparent materials possess small positive indices of refraction, except for a few semiconductors and insulators, such as lead sulphide or strontium titanate, that exhibit a rather high peak refractive index at mid- and far-infrared frequencies(18). Previous approaches using metamaterials were not successful in realizing broadband high refractive indices(19-21). A broadband high-refractive-index metamaterial structure was theoretically investigated only recently(22), but the proposed structure does not lend itself to easy implementation. Here we demonstrate that a broadband, extremely high index of refraction can be realized from large-area, free-standing, flexible terahertz metamaterials composed of strongly coupled unit cells. By drastically increasing the effective permittivity through strong capacitive coupling and decreasing the diamagnetic response with a thin metallic structure in the unit cell, a peak refractive index of 38.6 along with a low-frequency quasi-static value of over 20 were experimentally realized for a single-layer terahertz metamaterial, while maintaining low losses. As a natural extension of these single-layer metamaterials, we fabricated quasi-three-dimensional high-refractive-index metamaterials, and obtained a maximum bulk refractive index of 33.2 along with a value of around 8 at the quasi-static limit.","[Choi, Muhan; Lee, Seung Hoon; Kim, Yushin; Min, Bumki] Korea Adv Inst Sci & Technol, Dept Mech Engn, Taejon 305751, South Korea; [Kang, Seung Beom; Kwak, Min Hwan; Kang, Kwang-Young] Elect & Telecommun Res Inst, Convergence Components & Mat Res Lab, Taejon 305700, South Korea; [Shin, Jonghwa; Lee, Yong-Hee] Korea Adv Inst Sci & Technol, Dept Phys, Taejon 305751, South Korea; [Park, Namkyoo] Seoul Natl Univ, Sch Elect Engn & Comp Sci, Seoul 151744, South Korea","Min, B (reprint author), Korea Adv Inst Sci & Technol, Dept Mech Engn, Taejon 305751, South Korea.",bmin@kaist.ac.kr,"Lee, Yong Hee/C-2015-2011; Shin, Jonghwa/H-5817-2011; Min, Bumki/A-1294-2007; Park, Namkyoo/M-4669-2017","Shin, Jonghwa/0000-0003-0712-464X; Park, Namkyoo/0000-0003-0197-7633","Korean government [2009-0069459, 2008-0062235, 2010-0012058, GRL K20815000003, 2010-0001859]; MKE/KEIT [2006-S-005-04]; National Research Foundation of Korea [2007-0093863]","We thank B.

A nanoparticle's physical and chemical properties are controlled by its exact 3D morphology, structure and composition(1). Electron tomography enables the recovery of the shape of a nanoparticle from a series of projection images(2-4). Although atomic-resolution electron microscopy has been feasible for nearly four decades, neither electron tomography nor any other experimental technique has yet demonstrated atomic resolution in three dimensions. Here we report the 3D reconstruction of a complex crystalline nanoparticle at atomic resolution. To achieve this, we combined aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy(5-7), statistical parameter estimation theory(8,9) and discrete tomography(10,11). Unlike conventional electron tomography, only two images of the target-a silver nanoparticle embedded in an aluminium matrix-are sufficient for the reconstruction when combined with available knowledge about the particle's crystallographic structure.

Understanding past changes in the characteristics of such events, including recent increases in the intensity of heavy precipitation events over a large part of the Northern Hemisphere land area(3-5), is critical for reliable projections of future changes. Given that atmospheric water-holding capacity is expected to increase roughly exponentially with temperature-and that atmospheric water content is increasing in accord with this theoretical expectation(6-11)-it has been suggested that human-influenced global warming may be partly responsible for increases in heavy precipitation(3,5,7). Because of the limited availability of daily observations, however, most previous studies have examined only the potential detectability of changes in extreme precipitation through model-model comparisons(12-15). Here we show that human-induced increases in greenhouse gases have contributed to the observed intensification of heavy precipitation events found over approximately two-thirds of data-covered parts of Northern Hemisphere land areas. These results are based on a comparison of observed and multi-model simulated changes in extreme precipitation over the latter half of the twentieth century analysed with an optimal fingerprinting technique. Changes in extreme precipitation projected by models, and thus the impacts of future changes in extreme precipitation, may be underestimated because models seem to underestimate the observed increase in heavy precipitation with warming(16).","[Min, Seung-Ki; Zhang, Xuebin; Zwiers, Francis W.] Environm Canada, Div Climate Res, Toronto, ON M3H 5T4, Canada; [Hegerl, Gabriele C.] Univ Edinburgh, Sch Geosci, Edinburgh EH9 3JW, Midlothian, Scotland","Min, SK (reprint author), Environm Canada, Div Climate Res, Toronto, ON M3H 5T4, Canada.",seung-ki.min@ec.gc.ca; fwzwiers@uvic.ca,"Min, Seung-Ki/B-1431-2010",,"International Detection and Attribution Group (IDAG) by the US Department of Energy's Office of Science, Office of Biological and Environmental Research; National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Climate Program Office; Canadian International Polar Year (IPY) programme; NSF [ATM-0296007]","We thank N.

Yet climate models used to study the attribution problem typically do not resolve the weather systems associated with damaging events(2) such as the UK floods of October and November 2000. Occurring during the wettest autumn in England and Wales since records began in 1766(3,4), these floods damaged nearly 10,000 properties across that region, disrupted services severely, and caused insured losses estimated at 1.3 pound billion (refs 5, 6). Although the flooding was deemed a 'wakeup call' to the impacts of climate change at the time(7), such claims are typically supported only by general thermodynamic arguments that suggest increased extreme precipitation under global warming, but fail(8,9) to account fully for the complex hydrometeorology(4,10) associated with flooding. Here we present a multi-step, physically based 'probabilistic event attribution' framework showing that it is very likely that global anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions substantially increased the risk of flood occurrence in England and Wales in autumn 2000. Using publicly volunteered distributed computing(11,12), we generate several thousand seasonal-forecast-resolution climate model simulations of autumn 2000 weather, both under realistic conditions, and under conditions as they might have been had these greenhouse gas emissions and the resulting large-scale warming never occurred. Results are fed into a precipitation-runoff model that is used to simulate severe daily river runoff events in England and Wales (proxy indicators of flood events). The precise magnitude of the anthropogenic contribution remains uncertain, but in nine out of ten cases our model results indicate that twentieth-century anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions increased the risk of floods occurring in England and Wales in autumn 2000 by more than 20%, and in two out of three cases by more than 90%.","[Pall, Pardeep] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Inst Atmospher & Climate Sci, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland; [Pall, Pardeep; Stone, Daithi A.; Allen, Myles R.] Univ Oxford, Dept Phys, Oxford OX1 3PU, England; [Aina, Tolu] Univ Oxford, Oxford E Res Ctr, Oxford OX1 3QG, England; [Stone, Daithi A.; Allen, Myles R.] Oxford Univ Ctr Environm, Tyndall Ctr Oxford, Oxford OX1 3QY, England; [Stott, Peter A.] Met Off Hadley Ctr, Exeter EX1 3PB, Devon, England; [Nozawa, Toru] Natl Inst Environm Studies, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058506, Japan; [Hilberts, Arno G.

Yet a third of fish stocks worldwide are overexploited or depleted(1,2). Using individual case studies, many have argued that community-based co-management(3) should prevent the tragedy of the commons(4) because cooperative management by fishers, managers and scientists often results in sustainable fisheries(3,5,6). However, general and multidisciplinary evaluations of co-management regimes and the conditions for social, economic and ecological success within such regimes are lacking. Here we examine 130 co-managed fisheries in a wide range of countries with different degrees of development, ecosystems, fishing sectors and type of resources. We identified strong leadership as the most important attribute contributing to success, followed by individual or community quotas, social cohesion and protected areas. Less important conditions included enforcement mechanisms, long-term management policies and life history of the resources. Fisheries were most successful when at least eight co-management attributes were present, showing a strong positive relationship between the number of these attributes and success, owing to redundancy in management regulations. Our results demonstrate the critical importance of prominent community leaders and robust social capital(7), combined with clear incentives through catch shares and conservation benefits derived from protected areas, for successfully managing aquatic resources and securing the livelihoods of communities depending on them. Our study offers hope that co-management, the only realistic solution for the majority of the world's fisheries, can solve many of the problems facing global fisheries.","[Gutierrez, Nicolas L.; Hilborn, Ray] Univ Washington, Sch Aquat & Fishery Sci, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Defeo, Omar] Fac Ciencias, UNDECIMAR, Montevideo 11400, Uruguay","Gutierrez, NL (reprint author), Univ Washington, Sch Aquat & Fishery Sci, Box 355020, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.",nicolasg@uw.edu,"Gutierrez, Nicolas/D-4026-2009","Defeo, Omar/0000-0001-8318-528X",National Science Foundation [0308440]; Fulbright-OAS Initiative in Ecology; Pew Charitable Trusts,"N.L.G. was partially funded by the National Science Foundation (award 0308440) and a Fulbright-OAS Initiative in Ecology fellowship.

However, recent cell-lineage-tracing experiments indicate that the caudal neural plate and paraxial mesoderm are generated from common bipotential axial stem cells originating from the caudal lateral epiblast(1,2). Tbx6 null mutant mouse embryos which produce ectopic neural tubes at the expense of paraxial mesoderm(3) must provide a clue to the regulatory mechanism underlying this neural versus mesodermal fate choice. Here we demonstrate that Tbx6-dependent regulation of Sox2 determines the fate of axial stem cells. In wild-type embryos, enhancer N1 of the neural primordial gene Sox2 is activated in the caudal lateral epiblast, and the cells staying in the superficial layer sustain N1 activity and activate Sox2 expression in the neural plate(4-6). In contrast, the cells destined to become mesoderm activate Tbx6 and turn off enhancer N1 before migrating into the paraxial mesoderm compartment. In Tbx6 mutant embryos, however, enhancer N1 activity persists in the paraxial mesoderm compartment, eliciting ectopic Sox2 activation and transforming the paraxial mesoderm into neural tubes. An enhancer-N1-specific deletion mutation introduced into Tbx6 mutant embryos prevented this Sox2 activation in the mesodermal compartment and subsequent development of ectopic neural tubes, indicating that Tbx6 regulates Sox2 via enhancer N1. Tbx6-dependent repression of Wnt3a in the paraxial mesodermal compartment is implicated in this regulatory process. Paraxial mesoderm-specific misexpression of a Sox2 transgene in wild-type embryos resulted in ectopic neural tube development. Thus, Tbx6 represses Sox2 by inactivating enhancer N1 to inhibit neural development, and this is an essential step for the specification of paraxial mesoderm from the axial stem cells.","[Takemoto, Tatsuya; Uchikawa, Masanori; Yoshida, Megumi; Kondoh, Hisato] Osaka Univ, Grad Sch Frontier Biosci, Suita, Osaka 5650871, Japan; [Bell, Donald M.; Lovell-Badge, Robin] Natl Inst Med Res, MRC, Div Stem Cell Biol & Dev Genet, London NW7 1AA, England; [Papaioannou, Virginia E.] Columbia Univ Coll Phys & Surg, Dept Genet & Dev, New York, NY 10032 USA","Kondoh, H (reprint author), Osaka Univ, Grad Sch Frontier Biosci, 1-3 Yamadaoka, Suita, Osaka 5650871, Japan.",kondohh@fbs.osaka-u.ac.jp,,"Papaioannou, Virginia/0000-0001-7558-8601; Bell, Donald/0000-0002-3788-1580",MEXT Japan; NIH; MRC,"We thank the members of Kondoh laboratory for discussions.

However, the direct targets that mediate their effects on longevity remain unclear. In mammals, CREB-regulated transcriptional coactivators (CRTCs)(6) are a family of cofactors involved in diverse physiological processes including energy homeostasis(7-9), cancer(10) and endoplasmic reticulum stress(11). Here we show that both AMPK and calcineurin modulate longevity exclusively through post-translational modification of CRTC-1, the sole C. elegans CRTC. We demonstrate that CRTC-1 is a direct AMPK target, and interacts with the CREB homologue-1 (CRH-1) transcription factor in vivo. The pro-longevity effects of activating AMPK or deactivating calcineurin decrease CRTC-1 and CRH-1 activity and induce transcriptional responses similar to those of CRH-1 null worms. Downregulation of crtc-1 increases lifespan in a crh-1-dependent manner and directly reducing crh-1 expression increases longevity, substantiating a role for CRTCs and CREB in ageing. Together, these findings indicate a novel role for CRTCs and CREB in determining lifespan downstream of AMPK and calcineurin, and illustrate the molecular mechanisms by which an evolutionarily conserved pathway responds to low energy to increase longevity.","[Mair, William; Morantte, Ianessa; Shaw, Reuben J.; Dillin, Andrew] Salk Inst Biol Studies, Howard Hughes Med Inst, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; [Mair, William; Morantte, Ianessa; Montminy, Marc; Shaw, Reuben J.; Dillin, Andrew] Salk Inst Biol Studies, Glenn Fdn Med Res, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; [Rodrigues, Ana P.

The major driving force for self-renewal of the intestinal epithelium is the Wnt-mediated signalling pathway, and Wnt signalling is frequently hyperactivated in colorectal cancer(1). Here we show that casein kinase I alpha (CKI alpha), a component of the beta-catenin-destruction complex(1), is a critical regulator of the Wnt signalling pathway. Inducing the ablation of Csnk1a1 (the gene encoding CKI alpha) in the gut triggers massive Wnt activation, surprisingly without causing tumorigenesis. CKI alpha-deficient epithelium shows many of the features of human colorectal tumours in addition to Wnt activation, in particular the induction of the DNA damage response and cellular senescence, both of which are thought to provide a barrier against malignant transformation(2). The epithelial DNA damage response in mice is accompanied by substantial activation of p53, suggesting that the p53 pathway may counteract the pro-tumorigenic effects of Wnt hyperactivation. Notably, the transition from benign adenomas to invasive colorectal cancer in humans is typically linked to p53 inactivation, underscoring the importance of p53 as a safeguard against malignant progression(3); however, the mechanism of p53-mediated tumour suppression is unknown. We show that the maintenance of intestinal homeostasis inCKI alpha-deficient gut requires p53-mediated growth control, because the combined ablation of Csnk1a1 and either p53 or its target gene p21 (also known as Waf1, Cip1, Sdi1 and Cdkn1a) triggered high-grade dysplasia with extensive proliferation. Unexpectedly, these ablations also induced non-proliferating cells to invade the villous lamina propria rapidly, producing invasive carcinomas throughout the small bowel. Furthermore, in p53-deficient gut, loss of heterozygosity of the gene encoding CKI alpha caused a highly invasive carcinoma, indicating that CKI alpha functions as a tumour suppressor when p53 is inactivated. We identified a set of genes (the p53-suppressed invasiveness signature, PSIS) that is activated by the loss of both p53 and CKI alpha and which probably accounts for the brisk induction of invasiveness. PSIS transcription and tumour invasion were suppressed by p21, independently of cell cycle control. Restraining tissue invasion through suppressing PSIS expression is thus a novel tumour-suppressor function of wild-type p53.","[Elyada, Ela; Pribluda, Ariel; Goldstein, Robert E.; Morgenstern, Yael; Brachya, Guy; Cojocaru, Gady; Snir-Alkalay, Irit; Burstain, Ido; Pikarsky, Eli; Ben-Neriah, Yinon] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Hadassah Med Sch, IMRIC, Lautenberg Ctr Immunol, IL-91120 Jerusalem, Israel; [Haffner-Krausz, Rebecca] Weizmann Inst Sci, Dept Vet Resources, IL-76100 Rehovot, Israel; [Jung, Steffen] Weizmann Inst Sci, Dept Immunol, IL-76100 Rehovot, Israel; [Wiener, Zoltan; Alitalo, Kari] Univ Helsinki, Biomedicum Helsinki, Mol Canc Biol Program, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland; [Wiener, Zoltan; Alitalo, Kari] Univ Helsinki, Biomedicum Helsinki, Inst Mol Med Finland, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland; [Oren, Moshe] Weizmann Inst Sci, Dept Mol Cell Biol, IL-76100 Rehovot, Israel; [Pikarsky, Eli] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Hadassah Med Sch, IMRIC, Dept Pathol, IL-91120 Jerusalem, Israel","Ben-Neriah, Y (reprint author), Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Hadassah Med Sch, IMRIC, Lautenberg Ctr Immunol, IL-91120 Jerusalem, Israel.",peli@hadassah.org.il; yinon@cc.huji.ac.il,"Alitalo, Kari/J-5013-2014","Alitalo, Kari/0000-0002-7331-0902; Jung, Steffen/0000-0003-4290-5716",Dr. Miriam and Sheldon G.

Transcriptional activation of many TLR-responsive genes requires an initial de-repression step in which nuclear receptor co-repressor (NCoR) complexes are actively removed from the promoters of target genes to relieve basal repression(3,4). Ligand-dependent SUMOylation of liver X receptors (LXRs) has been found to suppress TLR4-induced transcription potently by preventing the NCoR clearance step(5-7), but the underlying mechanisms remain enigmatic. Here we provide evidence that coronin 2A (CORO2A), a component of the NCoR complex of previously unknown function(8,9), mediates TLR-induced NCoR turnover by a mechanism involving interaction with oligomeric nuclear actin. SUMOylated LXRs block NCoR turnover by binding to a conserved SUMO2/SUMO3-interaction motif in CORO2A and preventing actin recruitment. Intriguingly, the LXR transrepression pathway can itself be inactivated by inflammatory signals that induce calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II gamma (CaMKII gamma)-dependent phosphorylation of LXRs, leading to their deSUMOylation by the SUMO protease SENP3 and release from CORO2A. These findings uncover a CORO2A-actin-dependent mechanism for the de-repression of inflammatory response genes that can be differentially regulated by phosphorylation and by nuclear receptor signalling pathways that control immunity and homeostasis.","[Huang, Wendy; Ghisletti, Serena; Saijo, Kaoru; Zhang, Dawn X.; Yao, Joyee; Glass, Christopher K.] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Cellular & Mol Med, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Huang, Wendy; Zhang, Dawn X.] Univ Calif San Diego, Biomed Sci Grad Program, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Gandhi, Meghal; Goode, Bruce L.] Brandeis Univ, Rosenstiel Basic Med Sci Res Ctr, Dept Biol, Waltham, MA 02454 USA; [Aouadi, Myriam; Tesz, Greg J.; Czech, Michael P.] Univ Massachusetts, Program Mol Med, Sch Med, Worcester, MA 01605 USA; [Czech, Michael P.; Glass, Christopher K.] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Med, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Rosenfeld, Michael G.] Univ Calif San Diego, Howard Hughes Med Inst, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA","Glass, CK (reprint author), Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Cellular & Mol Med, 9500 Gilman Dr, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.",ckg@ucsd.edu,,"Glass, Christopher/0000-0003-4344-3592; Ghisletti, Serena/0000-0002-7087-5553","NRSA [1F31DK083913]; National Institutes of Health [CA52599, DK074868, HC088093, DK085853]; Leducq Foundation Transatlantic Network","We thank S.

Owing to its ability to excise thymine when mispaired with guanine, it was proposed to act against the mutability of 5-methylcytosine (5-mC) deamination in mammalian DNA(1). However, TDG was also found to interact with transcription factors(2,3), histone acetyltransferases(4) and de novo DNA methyltransferases(5,6), and it has been associated with DNA demethylation in gene promoters following activation of transcription(7-9), altogether implicating an engagement in gene regulation rather than DNA repair. Here we use a mouse genetic approach to determine the biological function of this multifaceted DNA repair enzyme. We find that, unlike other DNA glycosylases, TDG is essential for embryonic development, and that this phenotype is associated with epigenetic aberrations affecting the expression of developmental genes. Fibroblasts derived from Tdg null embryos (mouse embryonic fibroblasts, MEFs) show impaired gene regulation, coincident with imbalanced histone modification and CpG methylation at promoters of affected genes. TDG associates with the promoters of such genes both in fibroblasts and in embryonic stem cells (ESCs), but epigenetic aberrations only appear upon cell lineage commitment. We show that TDG contributes to the maintenance of active and bivalent chromatin throughout cell differentiation, facilitating a proper assembly of chromatin-modifying complexes and initiating base excision repair to counter aberrant de novo methylation. We thus conclude that TDG-dependent DNA repair has evolved to provide epigenetic stability in lineage committed cells.","[Cortazar, Daniel; Kunz, Christophe; Saito, Yusuke; Wirz, Annika; Schuermann, David; Jacobs, Angelika L.; Steinacher, Roland; Schaer, Primo] Univ Basel, Inst Biochem & Genet, Dept Biomed, CH-4048 Basel, Switzerland; [Selfridge, Jim; MacDougall, Eilidh; Bird, Adrian] Univ Edinburgh, Wellcome Trust Ctr Cell Biol, Edinburgh EH9 3JR, Midlothian, Scotland; [Lettieri, Teresa; Jiricny, Josef] Univ Zurich, Inst Mol Canc Res, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland; [Siegrist, Fredy] F Hoffmann La Roche Ltd, Global Preclin Safety, Pharmaceut Res, CH-4058 Basel, Switzerland","Schar, P (reprint author), Univ Basel, Inst Biochem & Genet, Dept Biomed, CH-4048 Basel, Switzerland.",primo.schaer@unibas.ch,"Siegrist, Fredy/A-8230-2013; Schar, Primo/G-5967-2012","Schar, Primo/0000-0003-1843-6147; Kunz, Christophe/0000-0002-0511-3915; Schurmann, David/0000-0003-2904-1378","Swiss National Science Foundation [3100A0-108436, 3100A0-122574/]; Association For International Cancer Research [01-330]","We thank D.

Selection of APC/C targets is achieved through recognition of destruction motifs, predominantly the destruction (D)-box(3) and KEN (Lys-Glu-Asn)-box(4). Although this process is known to involve a coactivator protein (either Cdc20 or Cdh1) together with core APC/C subunits(1,2), the structural basis for substrate recognition and ubiquitylation is not understood. Here we investigate budding yeast APC/C using single-particle electron microscopy and determine a cryo-electron microscopy map of APC/C in complex with the Cdh1 co-activator protein (APC/C-Cdh1) bound to a D-box peptide at similar to 10 angstrom resolution. We find that a combined catalytic and substrate-recognition module is located within the central cavity of the APC/C assembled from Cdh1, Apc10-a core APC/C subunit previously implicated in substrate recognition(5-7)-and the cullin domain of Apc2. Cdh1 and Apc10, identified from difference maps, create a co-receptor for the D-box following repositioning of Cdh1 towards Apc10. Using NMR spectroscopy we demonstrate specific D-box-Apc10 interactions, consistent with a role for Apc10 in directly contributing towards D-box recognition by the APC/C-Cdh1 complex. Our results rationalize the contribution of both co-activator and core APC/C subunits to D-box recognition(8,9) and provide a structural framework for understanding mechanisms of substrate recognition and catalysis by the APC/C.","[da Fonseca, Paula C.

However, the full range of prostate cancer genomic alterations is incompletely characterized. Here we present the complete sequence of seven primary human prostate cancers and their paired normal counterparts. Several tumours contained complex chains of balanced (that is, 'copy-neutral') rearrangements that occurred within or adjacent to known cancer genes. Rearrangement breakpoints were enriched near open chromatin, androgen receptor and ERG DNA binding sites in the setting of the ETS gene fusion TMPRSS2-ERG, but inversely correlated with these regions in tumours lacking ETS fusions. This observation suggests a link between chromatin or transcriptional regulation and the genesis of genomic aberrations. Three tumours contained rearrangements that disrupted CADM2, and four harboured events disrupting either PTEN (unbalanced events), a prostate tumour suppressor, or MAGI2 (balanced events), a PTEN interacting protein not previously implicated in prostate tumorigenesis. Thus, genomic rearrangements may arise from transcriptional or chromatin aberrancies and engage prostate tumorigenic mechanisms.","[Demichelis, Francesca; Esgueva, Raquel; Pflueger, Dorothee; Park, Kyung; Kitabayashi, Naoki; MacDonald, Theresa Y.; Rubin, Mark A.] Weill Cornell Med Coll, Dept Pathol & Lab Med, New York, NY 10065 USA; [Berger, Michael F.; Lawrence, Michael S.; Cibulskis, Kristian; Sivachenko, Andrey Y.; Sougnez, Carrie; Onofrio, Robert; Carter, Scott L.; Ambrogio, Lauren; Fennell, Timothy; Parkin, Melissa; Saksena, Gordon; Voet, Douglas; Ramos, Alex H.; Pugh, Trevor J.; Wilkinson, Jane; Fisher, Sheila; Winckler, Wendy; Mahan, Scott; Ardlie, Kristin; Baldwin, Jennifer; Chin, Lynda; Gabriel, Stacey B.; Golub, Todd R.; Meyerson, Matthew; Lander, Eric S.; Getz, Gad; Garraway, Levi A.] Harvard Univ, Broad Inst, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; [Berger, Michael F.; Lawrence, Michael S.; Cibulskis, Kristian; Sivachenko, Andrey Y.; Sougnez, Carrie; Onofrio, Robert; Carter, Scott L.; Ambrogio, Lauren; Fennell, Timothy; Parkin, Melissa; Saksena, Gordon; Voet, Douglas; Ramos, Alex H.; Pugh, Trevor J.; Wilkinson, Jane; Fisher, Sheila; Winckler, Wendy; Mahan, Scott; Ardlie, Kristin; Baldwin, Jennifer; Chin, Lynda; Gabriel, Stacey B.; Golub, Todd R.; Meyerson, Matthew; Lander, Eric S.; Getz, Gad; Garraway, Levi A.] MIT, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; [Demichelis, Francesca] Weill Cornell Med Coll, Inst Computat Biomed, New York, NY 10021 USA; [Drier, Yotam] Weizmann Inst Sci, Dept Phys Complex Syst, IL-76100 Rehovot, Israel; [Sboner, Andrea; Gerstein, Mark B.] Yale Univ, Dept Mol Biophys & Biochem, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Sboner, Andrea; Habegger, Lukas; Gerstein, Mark B.] Yale Univ, Program Computat Biol & Bioinformat, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Ramos, Alex H.; Pugh, Trevor J.; Kantoff, Philip W.; Chin, Lynda; Meyerson, Matthew; Lander, Eric S.; Garraway, Levi A.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Pugh, Trevor J.; Kantoff, Philip W.; Chin, Lynda; Meyerson, Matthew; Garraway, Levi A.] Dana Farber Canc Inst, Dept Med Oncol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Simons, Jonathan W.] Prostate Canc Fdn, Santa Monica, CA 90401 USA; [Chin, Lynda] Dana Farber Canc Inst, Belfer Inst Appl Canc Sci, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Gerstein, Mark B.] Yale Univ, Dept Comp Sci, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Golub, Todd R.] Dana Farber Canc Inst, Dept Pediat Oncol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Golub, Todd R.] Howard Hughes Med Inst, Chevy Chase, MD 20815 USA; [Golub, Todd R.; Meyerson, Matthew; Garraway, Levi A.] Dana Farber Canc Inst, Ctr Canc Genome Discovery, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Tewari, Ashutosh] Weill Cornell Med Coll, Inst Prostate Canc, Dept Urol, New York, NY 10065 USA; [Tewari, Ashutosh] Weill Cornell Med Coll, Lefrak Ctr Robot Surg, New York, NY 10065 USA; [Tewari, Ashutosh] New York Presbyterian Hosp, New York, NY 10065 USA; [Lander, Eric S.] 9 Cambridge Ctr, Whitehead Inst Biomed Res, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA","Rubin, MA (reprint author), Weill Cornell Med Coll, Dept Pathol & Lab Med, New York, NY 10065 USA.",rubinma@med.cornell.edu; levi_garraway@dfci.harvard.edu,"Sboner, Andrea/C-6487-2008; Meyerson, Matthew/E-7123-2012; Drier, Yotam/K-5208-2012","Sboner, Andrea/0000-0001-6915-3070; Drier, Yotam/0000-0003-1725-2995; Demichelis, Francesca/0000-0002-8266-8631; Rubin, Mark/0000-0002-8321-9950; Kantoff, Philip/0000-0001-7275-0597",Prostate Cancer Foundation/Movember; Howard Hughes Medical Institute; National Human Genome Research Institute; Kohlberg Foundation; National Cancer Institute (NCI); NCI Early Detection Research Network; National Institutes of Health; Department of Defense; Dana-Farber/Harvard Cancer Center [2 P50 CA090381-11]; Starr Cancer Consortium,"We thank R.

Genetic methods for neural circuit manipulation in mice provide a potentially powerful approach to this problem, but brain-stimulation-evoked aggression has never been demonstrated in this species. Here we show that optogenetic, but not electrical, stimulation of neurons in the ventromedial hypothalamus, ventrolateral subdivision (VMHvl) causes male mice to attack both females and inanimate objects, as well as males. Pharmacogenetic silencing of VMHvl reversibly inhibits inter-male aggression. Immediate early gene analysis and single unit recordings from VMHvl during social interactions reveal overlapping but distinct neuronal subpopulations involved in fighting and mating.

Information on how its 13 constituent proteins are assembled, and how they interact with co-activators, substrates and regulatory proteins is limited. Here, we describe a recombinant expression system that allows the reconstitution of holo APC/C and its sub-complexes that, when combined with electron microscopy, mass spectrometry and docking of crystallographic and homology-derived coordinates, provides a precise definition of the organization and structure of all essential APC/C subunits, resulting in a pseudo-atomic model for 70% of the APC/C. A lattice-like appearance of the APC/C is generated by multiple repeat motifs of most APC/C subunits. Three conserved tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) subunits (Cdc16, Cdc23 and Cdc27) share related superhelical homo-dimeric architectures that assemble to generate a quasi-symmetrical structure. Our structure explains how this TPR sub-complex, together with additional scaffolding subunits (Apc1, Apc4 and Apc5), coordinate the juxtaposition of the catalytic and substrate recognition module (Apc2, Apc11 and Apc10 (also known as Doc1)), and TPR-phosphorylation sites, relative to co-activator, regulatory proteins and substrates.","[Schreiber, Anne; Zhang, Ziguo; Enchev, Radoslav I.; Kong, Eric H.; Morris, Edward P.; da Fonseca, Paula C.

Cosmological simulations using the current cold dark matter model predict that these systems should descend from 'protoclusters'-early overdensities of massive galaxies that merge hierarchically to form a cluster(4,5). These protocluster regions themselves are built up hierarchically and so are expected to contain extremely massive galaxies that can be observed as luminous quasars and starbursts(4-6). Observational evidence for this picture, however, is sparse because high-redshift protoclusters are rare and difficult to observe(6,7). Here we report a protocluster region that dates from 1 Gyr (z = 55.3) after the Big Bang. This cluster of massive galaxies extends over more than 13 megaparsecs and contains a luminous quasar as well as a system rich in molecular gas(8). These massive galaxies place a lower limit of more than 4 x 10(11) solar masses of dark and luminous matter in this region, consistent with that expected from cosmological simulations for the earliest galaxy clusters(4,5,7).","[Capak, Peter L.; Yan, Lin] CALTECH, Spitzer Sci Ctr, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA; [Riechers, Dominik; Scoville, Nick Z.; Robertson, Brant] CALTECH, Dept Astron, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA; [Carilli, Chris] Natl Radio Astron Observ, Socorro, NM 87801 USA; [Cox, Pierre; Neri, Roberto] Inst Radio Astron Millimetr, F-38406 St Martin Dheres, France; [Salvato, Mara] Max Planck Inst Plasma Phys, D-85748 Garching, Germany; [Schinnerer, Eva; Karim, Alexander] Max Planck Inst Astron, D-69117 Heidelberg, Germany; [Wilson, Grant W.; Yun, Min] Univ Massachusetts, Dept Astron, Amherst, MA 01003 USA; [Civano, Francesca; Elvis, Martin] Harvard Smithsonian Ctr Astrophys, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Mobasher, Bahram] Univ Calif Riverside, Dept Phys & Astron, Riverside, CA 92521 USA; [Staguhn, Johannes G.] Johns Hopkins Univ, Lab Observat Cosmol, NASA, Goddard Space Flight Ctr, Greenbelt, MD 20771 USA","Capak, PL (reprint author), CALTECH, Spitzer Sci Ctr, 1200 E Calif Blvd, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA.",capak@astro.caltech.edu,,"Schinnerer, Eva/0000-0002-3933-7677",NASA; NSF,"These results are based on observations with: the W.

The Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) phase transition(2,3) in two-dimensional Bose gases presents a particularly interesting case because the marginal dimensionality and intrinsic scaling symmetry(4) result in a broad fluctuation regime and an extended range of universal scaling behaviour. Studies of the BKT transition in cold atoms have stimulated great interest in recent years(5-10), but a clear demonstration of critical behaviour near the phase transition has remained elusive. Here we report in situ density and density-fluctuation measurements of two-dimensional Bose gases of caesium at different temperatures and interaction strengths, observing scale-invariant, universal behaviours. The extracted thermodynamic functions confirm the existence of a wide universal region near the BKT phase transition, and provide a sensitive test of the universality predicted by classical-field theory(11,12) and quantum Monte Carlo calculations(13). Our experimental results provide evidence for growing density-density correlations in the fluctuation region, and call for further explorations of universal phenomena in classical and quantum critical physics.","[Hung, Chen-Lung; Zhang, Xibo; Gemelke, Nathan; Chin, Cheng] Univ Chicago, James Franck Inst, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Hung, Chen-Lung; Zhang, Xibo; Gemelke, Nathan; Chin, Cheng] Univ Chicago, Dept Phys, Chicago, IL 60637 USA","Hung, CL (reprint author), Univ Chicago, James Franck Inst, 5640 S Ellis Ave, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.",clhung@uchicago.edu,,,"NSF [PHY-0747907, NSF-MRSEC DMR-0213745]; Packard Foundation; Army Research Office; DARPA; Grainger Foundation","We thank Q.

Important steps towards this goal over the past fifteen years include the realization of simple logic gates with individually assembled semiconductor nanowires and carbon nanotubes(1,4-8), but with only 16 devices or fewer and a single function for each circuit. Recently, logic circuits also have been demonstrated that use two or three elements of a one-dimensional memristor array(9), although such passive devices without gain are difficult to cascade. These circuits fall short of the requirements for a scalable, multifunctional nanoprocessor(10,11) owing to challenges in materials, assembly and architecture on the nanoscale. Here we describe the design, fabrication and use of programmable and scalable logic tiles for nanoprocessors that surmount these hurdles. The tiles were built from programmable, non-volatile nanowire transistor arrays. Ge/Si core/shell nanowires(12) coupled to designed dielectric shells yielded single-nanowire, non-volatile field-effect transistors (FETs) with uniform, programmable threshold voltages and the capability to drive cascaded elements. We developed an architecture to integrate the programmable nanowire FETs and define a logic tile consisting of two interconnected arrays with 496 functional configurable FET nodes in an area of similar to 960 mu m(2). The logic tile was programmed and operated first as a full adder with a maximal voltage gain of ten and input-output voltage matching. Then we showed that the same logic tile can be reprogrammed and used to demonstrate full-subtractor, multiplexer, demultiplexer and clocked D-latch functions. These results represent a significant advance in the complexity and functionality of nanoelectronic circuits built from the bottom up with a tiled architecture that could be cascaded to realize fully integrated nanoprocessors with computing, memory and addressing capabilities.","[Yan, Hao; Hu, Yongjie; Lieber, Charles M.] Harvard Univ, Dept Chem & Chem Biol, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Choe, Hwan Sung] Harvard Univ, Dept Phys, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Nam, SungWoo; Lieber, Charles M.] Harvard Univ, Sch Engn & Appl Sci, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Das, Shamik; Klemic, James F.; Ellenbogen, James C.] Mitre Corp, Nanosyst Grp, Mclean, VA 22102 USA","Das, S (reprint author), Harvard Univ, Dept Chem & Chem Biol, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",sdas@mitre.org; cml@cmliris.harvard.edu,"Nam, SungWoo/D-5345-2011; Hu, Yongjie/A-8308-2013; Nam, SungWoo/C-1745-2015","Nam, SungWoo/0000-0002-9719-7203",National Security Science and Engineering Faculty; MITRE Corporation; US government's Nano-Enabled Technology Initiative; MITRE,"We thank D.

Although the catalysts developed thus far are remarkably effective at activating polarized functional groups, it is not clear whether organic Bronsted acids can be used to catalyse highly enantioselective transformations of unactivated carbon-carbon multiple bonds. This deficiency persists despite the fact that racemic acid-catalysed 'Markovnikov' additions to alkenes are well known chemical transformations. Here we show that chiral dithiophosphoric acids can catalyse the intramolecular hydroamination and hydroarylation of dienes and allenes to generate heterocyclic products in exceptional yield and enantiomeric excess. We present a mechanistic hypothesis that involves the addition of the acid catalyst to the diene, followed by nucleophilic displacement of the resulting dithiophosphate intermediate; we also report mass spectroscopic and deuterium labelling studies in support of the proposed mechanism. The catalysts and concepts revealed in this study should prove applicable to other asymmetric functionalizations of unsaturated systems.","[Shapiro, Nathan D.; Rauniyar, Vivek; Hamilton, Gregory L.; Wu, Jeffrey; Toste, F.

Observations(1,2) and models(5,6) suggest that oceanic and atmospheric temperature variations at Antarctica's margins affect global cryosphere stability, ocean circulation, sea levels and carbon cycling. In particular, recent climate changes on the Antarctic Peninsula have been dramatic, yet the Holocene climate variability of this region is largely unknown, limiting our ability to evaluate ongoing changes within the context of historical variability and underlying forcing mechanisms. Here we show that surface ocean temperatures at the continental margin of the western Antarctic Peninsula cooled by 3-4 degrees C over the past 12,000 years, tracking the Holocene decline of local (65 degrees S) spring insolation. Our results, based on TEX(86) sea surface temperature (SST) proxy evidence from a marine sediment core, indicate the importance of regional summer duration as a driver of Antarctic seasonal sea-ice fluctuations(7). On millennial timescales, abrupt SST fluctuations of 2-4 degrees C coincide with globally recognized climate variability(8). Similarities between our SSTs, Southern Hemisphere westerly wind reconstructions(9) and El Nino/Southern Oscillation variability(10) indicate that present climate teleconnections between the tropical Pacific Ocean and the western Antarctic Peninsula(11) strengthened late in the Holocene epoch. We conclude that during the Holocene, Southern Ocean temperatures at the western Antarctic Peninsula margin were tied to changes in the position of the westerlies, which have a critical role in global carbon cycling(9,12).","[Shevenell, A.

Both were originally associated with the flatworms (Platyhelminthes), but molecular data have revised their phylogenetic positions, generally linking Xenoturbellida to the deuterostomes(1,2) and positioning the Acoelomorpha as the most basally branching bilaterian group(s)(3-6). Recent phylogenomic data suggested that Xenoturbellida and Acoelomorpha are sister taxa and together constitute an early branch of Bilateria(7). Here we assemble three independent data sets-mitochondrial genes, a phylogenomic data set of 38,330 amino-acid positions and new microRNA (miRNA) complements-and show that the position of Acoelomorpha is strongly affected by a long-branch attraction (LBA) artefact. When we minimize LBA we find consistent support for a position of both acoelomorphs and Xenoturbella within the deuterostomes. The most likely phylogeny links Xenoturbella and Acoelomorpha in a clade we call Xenacoelomorpha. The Xenacoelomorpha is the sister group of the Ambulacraria (hemichordates and echinoderms). We show that analyses of miRNA complements(8) have been affected by character loss in the acoels and that both groups possess one miRNA and the gene Rsb66 otherwise specific to deuterostomes. In addition, Xenoturbella shares one miRNA with the ambulacrarians, and two with the acoels. This phylogeny makes sense of the shared characteristics of Xenoturbellida and Acoelomorpha, such as ciliary ultrastructure and diffuse nervous system, and implies the loss of various deuterostome characters in the Xenacoelomorpha including coelomic cavities, through gut and gill slits.","[Telford, Maximilian J.] UCL, Dept Genet Evolut & Environm, London WC1E 6BT, England; [Philippe, Herve; Brinkmann, Henner] Univ Montreal, Dept Biochim, Ctr Robert Cedergren, Montreal, PQ H3C 3J7, Canada; [Copley, Richard R.] Wellcome Trust Ctr Human Genet, Oxford OX3 7BN, England; [Moroz, Leonid L.] Univ Florida, Whitney Lab Marine Biosci, St Augustine, FL 32080 USA; [Moroz, Leonid L.] Univ Florida, Dept Neurosci, St Augustine, FL 32080 USA; [Moroz, Leonid L.] Univ Florida, Whitney Lab Marine Biosci, Gainesville, FL 32080 USA; [Moroz, Leonid L.] Univ Florida, Dept Neurosci, Gainesville, FL 32080 USA; [Nakano, Hiroaki] Univ Gothenburg, Dept Marine Ecol Kristineberg, S-45034 Fiskebackskil, Sweden; [Poustka, Albert J.] Max Planck Inst Mol Genet, Evolut & Dev Grp, D-14195 Berlin, Germany; [Wallberg, Andreas] Uppsala Univ, Dept Systemat Biol, Evolutionary Biol Ctr, Uppsala, Sweden; [Peterson, Kevin J.] Dartmouth Coll, Dept Biol, Hanover, NH 03755 USA","Telford, MJ (reprint author), UCL, Dept Genet Evolut & Environm, Darwin Bldg,Gower St, London WC1E 6BT, England.",m.telford@ucl.ac.uk,"Telford, Maximilian/B-7178-2008","Telford, Maximilian/0000-0002-3749-5620; Wallberg, Andreas/0000-0002-9081-9663",Canada Research Chairs; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council; Reseau Quebecois de Calcul de Haute Performance; Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council; National Science Foundation; NASA Ames; Wellcome Trust [075491/Z/04]; Max-Planck Society for the Advancement of Sciences,"We thank N.

Retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), amacrine cells and bipolar cells establish stereotypic neurite arborization patterns to form functional neural circuits in the inner plexiform layer (IPL)(1-3), a laminar region that is conventionally divided into five major parallel sublaminae(1,2). However, the molecular mechanisms governing distinct retinal subtype targeting to specific sublaminae within the IPL remain to be elucidated. Here we show that the transmembrane semaphorin Sema6A signals through its receptor PlexinA4 (PlexA4) to control lamina-specific neuronal stratification in the mouse retina. Expression analyses demonstrate that Sema6A and PlexA4 proteins are expressed in a complementary fashion in the developing retina: Sema6A in most ON sublaminae and PlexA4 in OFF sublaminae of the IPL. Mice with null mutations in PlexA4 or Sema6A exhibit severe defects in stereotypic lamina-specific neurite arborization of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-expressing dopaminergic amacrine cells, intrinsically photosensitive RGCs (ipRGCs) and calbindin-positive cells in the IPL. Sema6A and PlexA4 genetically interact in vivo for the regulation of dopaminergic amacrine cell laminar targeting. Therefore, neuronal targeting to subdivisions of the IPL in the mammalian retina is directed by repulsive transmembrane guidance cues present on neuronal processes.","[Matsuoka, Ryota L.; Kolodkin, Alex L.] Johns Hopkins Univ, Sch Med, Solomon H Snyder Dept Neurosci, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA; [Badea, Tudor C.] Johns Hopkins Univ, Sch Med, Dept Mol Biol & Genet, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA; [Matsuoka, Ryota L.; Badea, Tudor C.; Kolodkin, Alex L.] Johns Hopkins Univ, Sch Med, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA; [Nguyen-Ba-Charvet, Kim T.; Parray, Aijaz; Chedotal, Alain] INSERM, UMR S968, Inst Vis, F-75012 Paris, France; [Nguyen-Ba-Charvet, Kim T.; Parray, Aijaz; Chedotal, Alain] Univ Paris 06, UMR S968, Inst Vis, F-75012 Paris, France; [Nguyen-Ba-Charvet, Kim T.; Parray, Aijaz; Chedotal, Alain] CNRS, UMR 7210, Inst Vis, F-75012 Paris, France","Kolodkin, AL (reprint author), Johns Hopkins Univ, Sch Med, Solomon H Snyder Dept Neurosci, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA.",kolodkin@jhmi.edu,"chedotal, alain/F-2750-2017; Nguyen-Ba-Charvet, Kim/J-3507-2017","chedotal, alain/0000-0001-7577-3794; Nguyen-Ba-Charvet, Kim/0000-0001-5398-0872; Badea, Tudor Constantin/0000-0003-3086-6713; Matsuoka, Ryota/0000-0001-6214-2889",Nakajima Foundation; Fondation pour la Recherche Medicale (FRM); Fondation Retina France; Paris School of Neuroscience (ENP);  [R01 NS35165],"We thank K.-W.

Despite evidence for a role of the associated interval in neighbouring gene regulation(8-10), the biological underpinnings of these genetic associations with CAD or type 2 diabetes have not yet been explained. Here we identify 33 enhancers in 9p21; the interval is the second densest gene desert for predicted enhancers and six times denser than the whole genome (P < 6.55 x 10(-33)). The CAD risk alleles of SNPs rs10811656 and rs10757278 are located in one of these enhancers and disrupt a binding site for STAT1. Lymphoblastoid cell lines homozygous for the CAD risk haplotype show no binding of STAT1, and in lymphoblastoid cell lines homozygous for the CAD non-risk haplotype, binding of STAT1 inhibits CDKN2BAS (also known as CDKN2B-AS1) expression, which is reversed by short interfering RNA knockdown of STAT1. Using a new, open-ended approach to detect long-distance interactions, we find that in human vascular endothelial cells the enhancer interval containing the CAD locus physically interacts with the CDKN2A/B locus, the MTAP gene and an interval downstream of IFNA21. In human vascular endothelial cells, interferon-c activation strongly affects the structure of the chromatin and the transcriptional regulation in the 9p21 locus, including STAT1-binding, long-range enhancer interactions and altered expression of neighbouring genes. Our findings establish a link between CAD genetic susceptibility and the response to inflammatory signalling in a vascular cell type and thus demonstrate the utility of genome-wide association study findings in directing studies to novel genomic loci and biological processes important for disease aetiology.","[Rahim, Nazli G.; Topol, Eric J.] Scripps Res Inst, Scripps Translat Sci Inst, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; [Harismendy, Olivier; Frazer, Kelly A.] Univ Calif San Diego, Sch Med, Dept Pediat, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Harismendy, Olivier; Frazer, Kelly A.] Univ Calif San Diego, Sch Med, Radys Childrens Hosp, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Harismendy, Olivier; Frazer, Kelly A.] Univ Calif San Diego, Moores UCSD Canc Ctr, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Notani, Dimple; Song, Xiaoyuan; Tanasa, Bogdan; Rosenfeld, Michael G.] Univ Calif San Diego, Sch Med, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Dept Med, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Tanasa, Bogdan] Scripps Res Inst, Kellogg Sch Sci & Technol, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; [Heintzman, Nathaniel; Ren, Bing] Univ Calif San Diego, Sch Med, Ludwig Inst Canc Res, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Fu, Xiang-Dong] Univ Calif San Diego, Sch Med, Dept Cellular & Mol Med, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Frazer, Kelly A.] Univ Calif San Diego, Inst Genom Med, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA","Topol, EJ (reprint author), Scripps Res Inst, Scripps Translat Sci Inst, 3344 N Torrey Pines Court, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA.",etopol@scripps.edu; mrosenfeld@ucsd.edu; kafrazer@ucsd.edu,"Song, Xiaoyuan/P-1094-2014","Song, Xiaoyuan/0000-0002-9011-5033; Topol, Eric/0000-0002-1478-4729","National Center for Research Resources [1U54RR025204, 1UL1RR025774, 1UL1RR031980-01]; National Institutes of Health [HL065445, DK39949, DK018477, DK074868, L65445, CA97134, DK74686, NS34934, 1R21CA152613-01]; Department of Defence [BC075019]; Prostate Cancer Foundation","We thank X.

Here, we exploited the experimental merits of the mouse to test the hypothesis that pathways constraining progression might be activated in indolent Pten-null mouse prostate tumours and that inactivation of such progression barriers in mice would engender a metastasis-prone condition. Comparative transcriptomic and canonical pathway analyses, followed by biochemical confirmation, of normal prostate epithelium versus poorly progressive Pten-null prostate cancers revealed robust activation of the TGF beta/BMP-SMAD4 signalling axis. The functional relevance of SMAD4 was further supported by emergence of invasive, metastatic and lethal prostate cancers with 100% penetrance upon genetic deletion of Smad4 in the Pten-null mouse prostate. Pathological and molecular analysis as well as transcriptomic knowledge-based pathway profiling of emerging tumours identified cell proliferation and invasion as two cardinal tumour biological features in the metastatic Smad4/Pten-null PCA model. Follow-on pathological and functional assessment confirmed cyclin D1 and SPP1 as key mediators of these biological processes, which together with PTEN and SMAD4, form a four-gene signature that is prognostic of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) biochemical recurrence and lethal metastasis in human PCA. This model-informed progression analysis, together with genetic, functional and translational studies, establishes SMAD4 as a key regulator of PCA progression in mice and humans.","[Ding, Zhihu; Wu, Chang-Jiun; Chu, Gerald C.; Xiao, Yonghong; Ho, Dennis; Perry, Samuel R.; Labrot, Emma S.; Hu, Baoli; Jiang, Shan; Zheng, Hongwu; Stegh, Alexander H.; Scott, Kenneth L.; Wang, Y.

However, identification of genomic sequences that control human embryonic development represents a formidable challenge(3). Here we show that in human embryonic stem cells (hESCs), unique chromatin signatures identify two distinct classes of genomic elements, both of which are marked by the presence of chromatin regulators p300 and BRG1, monomethylation of histone H3 at lysine 4 (H3K4me1), and low nucleosomal density. In addition, elements of the first class are distinguished by the acetylation of histone H3 at lysine 27 (H3K27ac), overlap with previously characterized hESC enhancers, and are located proximally to genes expressed in hESCs and the epiblast. In contrast, elements of the second class, which we term 'poised enhancers', are distinguished by the absence of H3K27ac, enrichment of histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3), and are linked to genes inactive in hESCs and instead are involved in orchestrating early steps in embryogenesis, such as gastrulation, mesoderm formation and neurulation. Consistent with the poised identity, during differentiation of hESCs to neuroepithelium, a neuroectoderm-specific subset of poised enhancers acquires a chromatin signature associated with active enhancers. When assayed in zebrafish embryos, poised enhancers are able to direct cell-type and stage-specific expression characteristic of their proximal developmental gene, even in the absence of sequence conservation in the fish genome. Our data demonstrate that early developmental enhancers are epigenetically pre-marked in hESCs and indicate an unappreciated role of H3K27me3 at distal regulatory elements. Moreover, the wealth of new regulatory sequences identified here provides an invaluable resource for studies and isolation of transient, rare cell populations representing early stages of human embryogenesis.","[Rada-Iglesias, Alvaro; Bajpai, Ruchi; Swigut, Tomek; Brugmann, Samantha A.; Flynn, Ryan A.; Wysocka, Joanna] Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Dept Chem & Syst Biol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Wysocka, Joanna] Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Dept Dev Biol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA","Wysocka, J (reprint author), Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Dept Chem & Syst Biol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",wysocka@stanford.edu,,"Bajpai, Ruchi/0000-0001-7737-3567; Rada-Iglesias, Alvaro/0000-0001-7137-1341",WM Keck Foundation; CIRM [RN1 00579-1]; EMBO,"We thank Wysocka laboratory members for ideas and manuscript comments; I.

Earlier studies defined the STAU1-binding site within ADP-ribosylation factor 1 (ARF1) mRNA as a 19-base-pair stem with a 100-nucleotide apex(2). However, we were unable to identify comparable structures in the 3' UTRs of other targets of SMD. Here we show that STAU1-binding sites can be formed by imperfect base-pairing between an Alu element in the 3' UTR of an SMD target and another Alu element in a cytoplasmic, polyadenylated long non-coding RNA (lncRNA). An individual lncRNA can downregulate a subset of SMD targets, and distinct lncRNAs can downregulate the same SMD target. These are previously unappreciated functions of non-coding RNAs and Alu elements(3-5). Not all mRNAs that contain an Alu element in the 3' UTR are targeted for SMD even in the presence of a complementary lncRNA that targets other mRNAs for SMD. Most known trans-acting RNA effectors consist of fewer than 200 nucleotides, and these include small nucleolar RNAs and microRNAs. Our finding that the binding of STAU1 to mRNAs can be transactivated by lncRNAs uncovers an unexpected strategy that cells use to recruit proteins to mRNAs and mediate the decay of these mRNAs. We name these lncRNAs half-STAU1-binding site RNAs (1/2-sbsRNAs).","[Gong, Chenguang; Maquat, Lynne E.] Univ Rochester, Ctr RNA Biol, Rochester, NY 14642 USA; [Gong, Chenguang; Maquat, Lynne E.] Univ Rochester, Sch Med & Dent, Dept Biochem & Biophys, Rochester, NY 14642 USA","Maquat, LE (reprint author), Univ Rochester, Ctr RNA Biol, 601 Elmwood Ave, Rochester, NY 14642 USA.",lynne_maquat@urmc.rochester.edu,"Gong, Chenguang/F-5791-2014",,National Institutes of Health [GM074593]; Elon Huntington Hooker Graduate Student Fellowship,"We thank D.

Multiple planets transiting the same star reveal much more: period ratios determine stability and dynamics, mutual gravitational interactions reflect planet masses and orbital shapes, and the fraction of transiting planets observed as multiples has implications for the planarity of planetary systems. But few stars have more than one known transiting planet, and none has more than three. Here we report Kepler spacecraft observations of a single Sun-like star, which we call Kepler-11, that reveal six transiting planets, five with orbital periods between 10 and 47 days and a sixth planet with a longer period. The five inner planets are among the smallest for which mass and size have both been measured, and these measurements imply substantial envelopes of light gases. The degree of coplanarity and proximity of the planetary orbits imply energy dissipation near the end of planet formation.","[Lissauer, Jack J.; Rowe, Jason F.; Caldwell, Douglas A.; Christiansen, Jessie L.; Quintana, Elisa V.] NASA, Ames Res Ctr, SETI Inst, Moffett Field, CA 94035 USA; [Fabrycky, Daniel C.; Fortney, Jonathan J.; Lopez, Eric; Miller, Neil] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Univ Calif Observ, Lick Observ, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA; [Ford, Eric B.; Morehead, Robert C.] Univ Florida, Bryant Space Sci Ctr 211, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [Fressin, Francois; Torres, Guillermo; Carter, Joshua A.; Charbonneau, David; Desert, Jean-Michel; Geary, John C.; Holman, Matthew J.; Latham, David W.; Ragozzine, Darin; Sasselov, Dimitar] Harvard Smithsonian Ctr Astrophys, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Marcy, Geoffrey W.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Astron, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Orosz, Jerome A.; Welsh, William F.; Short, Donald R.] San Diego State Univ, San Diego, CA 92182 USA; [Batalha, Natalie M.] San Jose State Univ, Dept Phys & Astron, San Jose, CA 95192 USA; [Buchhave, Lars A.] Univ Copenhagen, Niels Bohr Inst, DK-2100 Copenhagen, Denmark; [Cochran, WilliamD.] Univ Texas Austin, McDonald Observ, Austin, TX 78712 USA; [Dunham, Edward W.] Lowell Observ, Flagstaff, AZ 86001 USA; [Fanelli, Michael N.] NASA, Ames Res Ctr, Bay Area Environm Res Inst, Moffett Field, CA 94035 USA; [Gautier, Thomas N., III] CALTECH, Jet Prop Lab, Pasadena, CA 91109 USA; [Gilliland, Ronald L.] Space Telescope Sci Inst, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA; [Hall, Jennifer R.; McCauliff, Sean] NASA, Ames Res Ctr, Orbital Sci Corp, Moffett Field, CA 94035 USA; [Steffen, Jason H.] Fermilab Ctr Particle Astrophys, Batavia, IL 60510 USA","Lissauer, JJ (reprint author), NASA, Ames Res Ctr, SETI Inst, Moffett Field, CA 94035 USA.",jack.lissauer@nasa.gov; fabrycky@ucolick.org,"Steffen, Jason/A-4320-2013; Carter, Joshua/A-8280-2013; Ragozzine, Darin/C-4926-2013; Caldwell, Douglas/L-7911-2014","Caldwell, Douglas/0000-0003-1963-9616; Fabrycky, Daniel/0000-0003-3750-0183; Buchhave, Lars A./0000-0003-1605-5666; /0000-0001-6545-639X; Fortney, Jonathan/0000-0002-9843-4354","NASA [HF-51272.01-A, HF-51267.01-A]; STScl [NAS 5-26555]","Kepler was competitively selected as the tenth Discovery mission.

Despite progress in SV characterization, the nucleotide resolution architecture of most SVs remains unknown. We constructed a map of unbalanced SVs (that is, copy number variants) based on whole genome DNA sequencing data from 185 human genomes, integrating evidence from complementary SV discovery approaches with extensive experimental validations. Our map encompassed 22,025 deletions and 6,000 additional SVs, including insertions and tandem duplications. Most SVs (53%) were mapped to nucleotide resolution, which facilitated analysing their origin and functional impact. We examined numerous whole and partial gene deletions with a genotyping approach and observed a depletion of gene disruptions amongst high frequency deletions. Furthermore, we observed differences in the size spectra of SVs originating from distinct formation mechanisms, and constructed a map of SV hotspots formed by common mechanisms. Our analytical framework and SV map serves as a resource for sequencing-based association studies.","[Rausch, Tobias; Stuetz, Adrian M.; Korbel, Jan O.] European Mol Biol Lab, Genome Biol Res Unit, Heidelberg, Germany; [Mills, Ryan E.; Shi, Xinghua; Lee, Charles] Brigham & Womens Hosp, Dept Pathol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Mills, Ryan E.; Shi, Xinghua; Lee, Charles] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Boston, MA USA; [Walter, Klaudia; Conrad, Donald F.; Scally, Aylwyn; Zhang, Yujun; Hurles, Matthew E.] Wellcome Trust Sanger Inst, Hinxton CB10 1SA, England; [Stewart, Chip; Kural, Deniz; Stromberg, Michael P.; Wu, Jiantao; Marth, Gabor T.] Boston Coll, Dept Biol, Boston, MA USA; [Handsaker, Robert E.; Korn, Joshua; Nemesh, James; McCarroll, Steven A.] Harvard Univ, Broad Inst, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Handsaker, Robert E.; Korn, Joshua; Nemesh, James; McCarroll, Steven A.] MIT, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Chen, Ken; Chinwalla, Asif; Ding, Li] Washington Univ, Genome Ctr, St Louis, MO USA; [Alkan, Can; Kidd, Jeffrey M.; Eichler, Evan E.] Univ Washington, Sch Med, Dept Genome Sci, Seattle, WA USA; [Alkan, Can; Eichler, Evan E.] Univ Washington, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Abyzov, Alexej; Khurana, Ekta; Leng, Jing; Mu, Xinmeng Jasmine; Zhang, Zhengdong D.; Gerstein, Mark B.] Yale Univ, Program Computat Biol & Bioinformat, New Haven, CT USA; [Yoon, Seungtai Chris] Mt Sinai Sch Med, Seaver Autism Ctr, New York, NY USA; [Yoon, Seungtai Chris] Mt Sinai Sch Med, Dept Psychiat, New York, NY USA; [Ye, Kai] Leiden Univ, Med Ctr, Dept Mol Epidemiol, Leiden, Netherlands; [Ye, Kai] Leiden Univ, Med Ctr, Dept Med Stat & Bioinformat, Leiden, Netherlands; [Cheetham, R.

The birth and growth of the first 'seed' black holes in the earlier Universe, however, is observationally unconstrained(3) and we are only beginning to piece together a scenario for their subsequent evolution(4). Here we report that the nearby dwarf starburst galaxy Henize 2-10 (refs 5 and 6) contains a compact radio source at the dynamical centre of the galaxy that is spatially coincident with a hard X-ray source. From these observations, we conclude that Henize 2-10 harbours an actively accreting central black hole with a mass of approximately one million solar masses. This nearby dwarf galaxy, simultaneously hosting a massive black hole and an extreme burst of star formation, is analogous in many ways to galaxies in the infant Universe during the early stages of black-hole growth and galaxy mass assembly. Our results confirm that nearby star-forming dwarf galaxies can indeed form massive black holes, and that by implication so can their primordial counterparts. Moreover, the lack of a substantial spheroidal component in Henize 2-10 indicates that supermassive black-hole growth may precede the build-up of galaxy spheroids.","[Reines, Amy E.; Sivakoff, Gregory R.; Johnson, Kelsey E.] Univ Virginia, Dept Astron, Charlottesville, VA 22904 USA; [Johnson, Kelsey E.; Brogan, Crystal L.] Natl Radio Astron Observ, Charlottesville, VA 22904 USA","Reines, AE (reprint author), Univ Virginia, Dept Astron, 530 McCormick Rd, Charlottesville, VA 22904 USA.",areines@virginia.edu,"Sivakoff, Gregory/G-9602-2011","Sivakoff, Gregory/0000-0001-6682-916X",NASA; University of Virginia; NASA through the Chandra X-ray Observatory Center; NSF; David and Lucile Packard Foundation; NASA through Space Telescope Science Institute,"A.E.R. is grateful for many discussions on this work, in particular with M.

It is a necessary ingredient in most emerging quantum technologies, including quantum repeaters(1), quantum information processing(2) and the strongest forms of quantum cryptography(3). Spin ensembles, such as those used in liquid-state nuclear magnetic resonance(4,5), have been important for the development of quantum control methods. However, these demonstrations contain no entanglement and ultimately constitute classical simulations of quantum algorithms. Here we report the on-demand generation of entanglement between an ensemble of electron and nuclear spins in isotopically engineered, phosphorus-doped silicon. We combined high-field (3.4 T), low-temperature (2.9 K) electron spin resonance with hyperpolarization of the (31)P nuclear spin to obtain an initial state of sufficient purity to create a non-classical, inseparable state. The state was verified using density matrix tomography based on geometric phase gates, and had a fidelity of 98% relative to the ideal state at this field and temperature. The entanglement operation was performed simultaneously, with high fidelity, on 10(10) spin pairs; this fulfils one of the essential requirements for a silicon-based quantum information processor.","[Simmons, Stephanie; Brown, Richard M.; Morton, John J.

H.",,,Femtosecond X-ray protein nanocrystallography,NATURE,,,English,Article,,,,,,,RESOLUTION; DIFFRACTION; CRYSTALS; REFINEMENT; MICROSCOPY,"X-ray crystallography provides the vast majority of macromolecular structures, but the success of the method relies on growing crystals of sufficient size. In conventional measurements, the necessary increase in X-ray dose to record data from crystals that are too small leads to extensive damage before a diffraction signal can be recorded(1-3). It is particularly challenging to obtain large, well-diffracting crystals of membrane proteins, for which fewer than 300 unique structures have been determined despite their importance in all living cells. Here we present a method for structure determination where single-crystal X-ray diffraction 'snapshots' are collected from a fully hydrated stream of nanocrystals using femtosecond pulses from a hard-X-ray free-electron laser, the Linac Coherent Light Source(4). We prove this concept with nanocrystals of photosystem I, one of the largest membrane protein complexes(5). More than 3,000,000 diffraction patterns were collected in this study, and a three-dimensional data set was assembled from individual photosystem I nanocrystals (similar to 200 nm to 2 mm in size). We mitigate the problem of radiation damage in crystallography by using pulses briefer than the timescale of most damage processes(6). This offers a new approach to structure determination of macromolecules that do not yield crystals of sufficient size for studies using conventional radiation sources or are particularly sensitive to radiation damage.","[Chapman, Henry N.; Barty, Anton; White, Thomas A.; Aquila, Andrew; Schulz, Joachim; DePonte, Daniel P.; Martin, Andrew V.; Coppola, Nicola; Liang, Mengning; Caleman, Carl; Gumprecht, Lars; Stern, Stephan] DESY, Ctr Free Electron Laser Sci, D-22607 Hamburg, Germany; [Chapman, Henry N.; Nass, Karol] Univ Hamburg, D-22761 Hamburg, Germany; [Fromme, Petra; Hunter, Mark S.; Grotjohann, Ingo; Fromme, Raimund] Arizona State Univ, Dept Chem & Biochem, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA; [Kirian, Richard A.; Weierstall, Uwe; Doak, R.

Very short and extremely bright, coherent X-ray pulses can be used to outrun key damage processes and obtain a single diffraction pattern from a large macromolecule, a virus or a cell before the sample explodes and turns into plasma(1). The continuous diffraction pattern of non-crystalline objects permits oversampling and direct phase retrieval(2). Here we show that high-quality diffraction data can be obtained with a single X-ray pulse from a noncrystalline biological sample, a single mimivirus particle, which was injected into the pulsed beam of a hard-X-ray free-electron laser, the Linac Coherent Light Source(5). Calculations indicate that the energy deposited into the virus by the pulse heated the particle to over 100,000 K after the pulse had left the sample. The reconstructed exit wavefront (image) yielded 32-nm full-period resolution in a single exposure and showed no measurable damage. The reconstruction indicates inhomogeneous arrangement of dense material inside the virion. We expect that significantly higher resolutions will be achieved in such experiments with shorter and brighter photon pulses focused to a smaller area. The resolution in such experiments can be further extended for samples available in multiple identical copies.","[Seibert, M. Marvin; Ekeberg, Tomas; Maia, Filipe R. N.

Proposed mechanisms for the rise in methane concentrations relate either to methane emissions from anthropogenic early rice cultivation(1,3) or an increase in natural wetland emissions from tropical(4) or boreal sources(5,6). Here we show that our climate and wetland simulations of the global methane cycle over the last glacial cycle (the past 130,000 years) recreate the ice core record and capture the late Holocene increase in methane concentrations. Our analyses indicate that the late Holocene increase results from natural changes in the Earth's orbital configuration, with enhanced emissions in the Southern Hemisphere tropics linked to precession-induced modification of seasonal precipitation. Critically, our simulations capture the declining trend in methane concentrations at the end of the last interglacial period (115,000-130,000 years ago) that was used to diagnose the Holocene methane rise as unique. The difference between the two time periods results from differences in the size and rate of regional insolation changes and the lack of glacial inception in the Holocene. Our findings also suggest that no early agricultural sources are required to account for the increase in methane concentrations in the 5,000 years before the industrial era.","[Singarayer, Joy S.; Valdes, Paul J.; Friedlingstein, Pierre; Nelson, Sarah] Univ Bristol, Sch Geog Sci, Bristol Res Initiat Dynam Global Environm, Bristol BS8 1SS, Avon, England; [Friedlingstein, Pierre] Univ Exeter, Coll Engn Math & Phys Sci, Exeter EX4 4QF, Devon, England; [Beerling, David J.] Univ Sheffield, Dept Anim & Plant Sci, Sheffield S10 2TN, S Yorkshire, England","Singarayer, JS (reprint author), Univ Bristol, Sch Geog Sci, Bristol Res Initiat Dynam Global Environm, Univ Rd, Bristol BS8 1SS, Avon, England.",joy.singarayer@bristol.ac.uk,"Valdes, Paul/C-4129-2013; Beerling, David/C-2840-2009; Friedlingstein, Pierre/H-2700-2014","Beerling, David/0000-0003-1869-4314; ",Royal Society; Leverhulme Trust,"J.S.S. and P.J.V. thank the BBC for commissioning the climate simulations for their TV series, The Incredible Human Journey.

However, in the billabongs (oxbow lakes) of Kakadu National Park, Australia, control is fitful and incomplete. By fitting a process-based nonlinear model to thirteen-year data sets from four billabongs, here we show that incomplete control can be explained by alternative stable states(1-4)-one state in which salvinia is suppressed and the other in which salvinia escapes weevil control. The shifts between states are associated with annual flooding events. In some years, high water flow reduces weevil populations, allowing the shift from a controlled to an uncontrolled state; in other years, benign conditions for weevils promote the return shift to the controlled state. In most described ecological examples, transitions between alternative stable states are relatively rare, facilitated by slow-moving environmental changes, such as accumulated nutrient loading or climate change(5,6). The billabongs of Kakadu give a different manifestation of alternative stable states that generate complex and seemingly unpredictable dynamics. Because shifts between alternative stable states are stochastic, they present a potential management strategy to maximize effective biological control: when the domain of attraction to the state of salvinia control is approached, augmentation of the weevil population or reduction of the salvinia biomass may allow the lower state to trap the system.","[Ives, Anthony R.] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Zool, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Schooler, Shon S.; Julien, Mic H.] CSIRO Ecosyst Sci, Long Pocket Labs, Indooroopilly, Qld 4068, Australia; [Salau, Buck] Dept Environm Water Heritage & Arts, Jabiru, NT 0886, Australia","Ives, AR (reprint author), Univ Wisconsin, Dept Zool, Madison, WI 53706 USA.",arives@wisc.edu,"Schooler, Shon/C-1860-2008; Ives, Anthony/A-5698-2008; Julien, Mic/B-6619-2009",,"Australian Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry; CSIRO; United States National Science Foundation through the North Temperate Lakes Long Term Ecological Research Network","We thank S.

In the past 50 years, these fish were shown to have antibody-like responses and the capacity to reject allografts(1) but were found to lack the immunoglobulin-based adaptive immune system of jawed vertebrates(2). Recent work has shown that lampreys have lymphocytes that instead express somatically diversified antigen receptors that contain leucine-rich-repeats, termed variable lymphocyte receptors (VLRs)(3,4), and that the type of VLR expressed is specific to the lymphocyte lineage: T-like lymphocytes express type A VLR (VLRA) genes, and B-like lymphocytes express VLRB genes(5). These clonally diverse anticipatory antigen receptors are assembled from incomplete genomic fragments by gene conversion(6-9), which is thought to be initiated by either of two genes encoding cytosine deaminase(9), cytosine deaminase 1 (CDA1) in T-like cells and CDA2 in B-like cells(5). It is unknown whether jawless fish, like jawed vertebrates, have dedicated primary lymphoid organs, such as the thymus, where the development and selection of lymphocytes takes place(10,11). Here we identify discrete thymus-like lympho-epithelial structures, termed thymoids, in the tips of the gill filaments and the neighbouring secondary lamellae (both within the gill basket) of lamprey larvae. Only in the thymoids was expression of the orthologue of the gene encoding forkhead box N1 (FOXN1)(10), a marker of the thymopoietic microenvironment in jawed vertebrates(12), accompanied by expression of CDA1 and VLRA. This expression pattern was unaffected by immunization of lampreys or by stimulation with a T-cell mitogen. Non-functional VLRA gene assemblies were found frequently in the thymoids but not elsewhere, further implicating the thymoid as the site of development of T-like cells in lampreys. These findings suggest that the similarities underlying the dual nature of the adaptive immune systems in the two sister groups of vertebrates extend to primary lymphoid organs.","[Bajoghli, Baubak; Aghaallaei, Narges; Strohmeier, Christine; Schorpp, Michael; Boehm, Thomas] Max Planck Inst Immunobiol & Epigenet, Dept Dev Immunol, D-79108 Freiburg, Germany; [Guo, Peng; Hirano, Masayuki; McCurley, Nathanael; Cooper, Max D.] Emory Vaccine Ctr, Atlanta, GA 30329 USA; [Guo, Peng; Hirano, Masayuki; McCurley, Nathanael; Cooper, Max D.] Emory Univ, Dept Pathol & Lab Med, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA; [Bockman, Dale E.] Med Coll Georgia, Dept Cellular Biol & Anat, Augusta, GA 30912 USA","Boehm, T (reprint author), Max Planck Inst Immunobiol & Epigenet, Dept Dev Immunol, Stuebeweg 51, D-79108 Freiburg, Germany.",boehm@immunbio.mpg.de,,"Bajoghli, Baubak/0000-0003-1395-6362",Max Planck Society; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft; National Institutes of Health; Georgia Research Alliance,"We thank C.

Mammals can partly repair their nephrons (the functional units of the kidney), but cannot form new ones(2,3). By contrast, fish add nephrons throughout their lifespan and regenerate nephrons de novo after injury(4,5), providing a model for understanding how mammalian renal regeneration may be therapeutically activated. Here we trace the source of new nephrons in the adult zebrafish to small cellular aggregates containing nephron progenitors. Transplantation of single aggregates comprising 10-30 cells is sufficient to engraft adults and generate multiple nephrons. Serial transplantation experiments to test self-renewal revealed that nephron progenitors are long-lived and possess significant replicative potential, consistent with stem-cell activity. Transplantation of mixed nephron progenitors tagged with either green or red fluorescent proteins yielded some mosaic nephrons, indicating that multiple nephron progenitors contribute to a single nephron. Consistent with this, live imaging of nephron formation in transparent larvae showed that nephrogenic aggregates form by the coalescence of multiple cells and then differentiate into nephrons. Taken together, these data demonstrate that the zebrafish kidney probably contains self-renewing nephron stem/progenitor cells. The identification of these cells paves the way to isolating or engineering the equivalent cells in mammals and developing novel renal regenerative therapies.","[Diep, Cuong Q.; Ma, Dongdong; Deo, Rahul C.; Holm, Teresa M.; Naylor, Richard W.; Wingert, Rebecca A.; Cowan, Chad A.; Handin, Robert I.; Davidson, Alan J.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Ma, Dongdong; Handin, Robert I.] Brigham & Womens Hosp, Div Hematol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Wingert, Rebecca A.; Cowan, Chad A.; Handin, Robert I.; Davidson, Alan J.] Harvard Stem Cell Inst, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Bollig, Frank; Englert, Christoph] Fritz Lipmann Inst, Leibniz Inst Age Res, D-07745 Jena, Germany; [Zhu, Hao] Dana Farber Canc Inst, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Ikenaga, Takanori; Ono, Fumihito] NIAAA, Sect Model Synapt Syst, Lab Mol Physiol, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Englert, Christoph] Friedrich Schiller Univ, D-07743 Jena, Germany; [Cowan, Chad A.] Harvard Univ, Dept Stem Cell & Regenerat Biol, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Hukriede, Neil A.] Univ Pittsburgh, Sch Med, Dept Dev Biol, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA; [Diep, Cuong Q.; Deo, Rahul C.; Holm, Teresa M.; Naylor, Richard W.; Arora, Natasha; Wingert, Rebecca A.; Djordjevic, Gordana; Lichman, Benjamin; Cowan, Chad A.; Davidson, Alan J.] Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Ctr Regenerat Med, Boston, MA 02114 USA","Davidson, AJ (reprint author), Univ Auckland, Sch Med Sci, Dept Mol Med & Pathol, Auckland 1142, New Zealand.",a.davidson@auckland.ac.nz,,"Ikenaga, Takanori/0000-0002-7321-9703; Naylor, Richard/0000-0003-2901-7677; Lichman, Benjamin/0000-0002-0033-1120; Englert, Christoph/0000-0002-5931-3189; Zhu, Hao/0000-0002-8417-9698",Harvard Stem Cell Institute; American Society of Nephrology; National Institutes of Health/National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases [P50DK074030],"We thank E.

Several studies have reported that the severity of chronic pain and tinnitus is correlated with the degree of map reorganization in somatosensory and auditory cortex, respectively(1,4). Direct electrical or transcranial magnetic stimulation of sensory cortex can temporarily disrupt these phantom sensations(5). However, there is as yet no direct evidence for a causal role of plasticity in the generation of pain or tinnitus. Here we report evidence that reversing the brain changes responsible can eliminate the perceptual impairment in an animal model of noise-induced tinnitus. Exposure to intense noise degrades the frequency tuning of auditory cortex neurons and increases cortical synchronization. Repeatedly pairing tones with brief pulses of vagus nerve stimulation completely eliminated the physiological and behavioural correlates of tinnitus in noise-exposed rats. These improvements persisted for weeks after the end of therapy. This method for restoring neural activity to normal may be applicable to a variety of neurological disorders.","[Engineer, Navzer D.; Riley, Jonathan R.; Seale, Jonathan D.; Vrana, Will A.; Shetake, Jai A.; Sudanagunta, Sindhu P.; Borland, Michael S.; Kilgard, Michael P.] Univ Texas Dallas, Cort Plast Lab, Richardson, TX 75080 USA; [Engineer, Navzer D.] MicroTransponder Inc, Austin, TX 78738 USA","Engineer, ND (reprint author), Univ Texas Dallas, Cort Plast Lab, Richardson, TX 75080 USA.",navzer@utdallas.edu,,,James S.

For example, human PSCs have been differentiated into monolayer cultures of liver hepatocytes and pancreatic endocrine cells(3-6) that have therapeutic efficacy in animal models of liver disease(7,8) and diabetes(9), respectively. However, the generation of complex three-dimensional organ tissues in vitro remains a major challenge for translational studies. Here we establish a robust and efficient process to direct the differentiation of human PSCs into intestinal tissue in vitro using a temporal series of growth factor manipulations to mimic embryonic intestinal development(10). This involved activin-induced definitive endoderm formation(11), FGF/Wnt-induced posterior endoderm pattering, hindgut specification and morphogenesis(12-14), and a pro-intestinal culture system(15,16) to promote intestinal growth, morphogenesis and cytodifferentiation. The resulting three-dimensional intestinal 'organoids' consisted of a polarized, columnar epithelium that was patterned into villus-like structures and crypt-like proliferative zones that expressed intestinal stem cell markers(17). The epithelium contained functional enterocytes, as well as goblet, Paneth and enteroendocrine cells. Using this culture system as a model to study human intestinal development, we identified that the combined activity of WNT3A and FGF4 is required for hindgut specification whereas FGF4 alone is sufficient to promote hindgut morphogenesis. Our data indicate that human intestinal stem cells form de novo during development. We also determined that NEUROG3, a pro-endocrine transcription factor that is mutated in enteric anendocrinosis(18), is both necessary and sufficient for human enteroendocrine cell development in vitro. PSC-derived human intestinal tissue should allow for unprecedented studies of human intestinal development and disease.","[Spence, Jason R.; Mayhew, Christopher N.; Rankin, Scott A.; Kuhar, Matthew F.; Tolle, Kathryn; Kalinichenko, Vladimir V.; Zorn, Aaron M.; Shroyer, Noah F.; Wells, James M.] Cincinnati Childrens Hosp Med Ctr, Div Dev Biol, Cincinnati, OH 45229 USA; [Vallance, Jefferson E.; Shroyer, Noah F.] Cincinnati Childrens Hosp Med Ctr, Div Gastroenterol Hepatol & Nutr, Cincinnati, OH 45229 USA; [Hoskins, Elizabeth E.; Wells, Susanne I.] Cincinnati Childrens Hosp Med Ctr, Div Hematol & Oncol, Cincinnati, OH 45229 USA; [Kalinichenko, Vladimir V.] Cincinnati Childrens Hosp Med Ctr, Div Pulm Biol, Cincinnati, OH 45229 USA","Wells, JM (reprint author), Cincinnati Childrens Hosp Med Ctr, Div Dev Biol, 3333 Burnet Ave, Cincinnati, OH 45229 USA.",james.wells@cchmc.org,,"Shroyer, Noah/0000-0002-5934-2852","Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation [JDRF-2-2003-530]; NIH [R01GM072915, R01DK080823A1 and S1, R03 DK084167, R01 CA142826, F32 DK83202-01, T32 HD07463];  [P30 DK078392];  [U54 RR025216]","We thank members of the laboratory, D.

Here we report the identification of novel genes involved in R-gene-mediated resistance against downy mildew in Arabidopsis and their regulatory control by the circadian regulator, CIRCADIAN CLOCK-ASSOCIATED 1 (CCA1). Numerical clustering based on phenotypes of these gene mutants revealed that programmed cell death (PCD) is the major contributor to resistance. Mutants compromised in the R-gene-mediated PCD were also defective in basal resistance, establishing an interconnection between these two distinct defence mechanisms. Surprisingly, we found that these new defence genes are under circadian control by CCA1, allowing plants to 'anticipate' infection at dawn when the pathogen normally disperses the spores and time immune responses according to the perception of different pathogenic signals upon infection. Temporal control of the defence genes by CCA1 differentiates their involvement in basal and R-gene-mediated defence.

Constitutive nuclear factor (NF)-kappa B and JAK kinase signalling promotes malignant cell survival in these lymphomas, but the genetic basis for this signalling is incompletely understood. Here we describe the dependence of ABC DLBCLs on MYD88, an adaptor protein that mediates toll and interleukin (IL)-1 receptor signalling(2,3), and the discovery of highly recurrent oncogenic mutations affecting MYD88 in ABC DLBCL tumours. RNA interference screening revealed that MYD88 and the associated kinases IRAK1 and IRAK4 are essential for ABC DLBCL survival. High-throughput RNA resequencing uncovered MYD88 mutations in ABC DLBCL lines. Notably, 29% of ABC DLBCL tumours harboured the same amino acid substitution, L265P, in the MYD88 Toll/IL-1 receptor (TIR) domain at an evolutionarily invariant residue in its hydrophobic core. This mutation was rare or absent in other DLBCL subtypes and Burkitt's lymphoma, but was observed in 9% of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphomas. At a lower frequency, additional mutations were observed in the MYD88 TIR domain, occurring in both the ABC and germinal centre B-cell-like (GCB) DLBCL subtypes. Survival of ABC DLBCL cells bearing the L265P mutation was sustained by the mutant but not the wild-type MYD88 isoform, demonstrating that L265P is a gain-of-function driver mutation. The L265P mutant promoted cell survival by spontaneously assembling a protein complex containing IRAK1 and IRAK4, leading to IRAK4 kinase activity, IRAK1 phosphorylation, NF-kappa B signalling, JAK kinase activation of STAT3, and secretion of IL-6, IL-10 and interferon-beta.

They are increasingly recognized to be preferential targets for oncogene-induced DNA damage in pre-neoplastic lesions(2) and hotspots for chromosomal rearrangements in various cancers(3). Common fragile site instability was attributed to the fact that they contain sequences prone to form secondary structures that may impair replication fork movement, possibly leading to fork collapse resulting in DNA breaks(4). Here we show, in contrast to this view, that the fragility of FRA3B-the most active common fragile site in human lymphocytes-does not rely on fork slowing or stalling but on a paucity of initiation events. Indeed, in lymphoblastoid cells, but not in fibroblasts, initiation events are excluded from a FRA3B core extending approximately 700 kilobases, which forces forks coming from flanking regions to cover long distances in order to complete replication. We also show that origins of the flanking regions fire in mid-S phase, leaving the site incompletely replicated upon fork slowing. Notably, FRA3B instability is specific to cells showing this particular initiation pattern. The fact that both origin setting(5,6) and replication timing are highly plastic(7,8) in mammalian cells explains the tissue specificity of common fragile site instability we observed. Thus, we propose that common fragile sites correspond to the latest initiation-poor regions to complete replication in a given cell type. For historical reasons, common fragile sites have been essentially mapped in lymphocytes(1). Therefore, common fragile site contribution to chromosomal rearrangements in tumours should be reassessed after mapping fragile sites in the cell type from which each tumour originates.","[Letessier, Anne; Millot, Gael A.; Koundrioukoff, Stephane; Lachages, Anne-Marie; Vogt, Nicolas; Malfoy, Bernard; Brison, Olivier; Debatisse, Michelle] Inst Curie, Ctr Rech, F-75248 Paris, France; [Letessier, Anne; Millot, Gael A.; Koundrioukoff, Stephane; Lachages, Anne-Marie; Vogt, Nicolas; Malfoy, Bernard; Brison, Olivier; Debatisse, Michelle] Univ Paris 06, F-75005 Paris, France; [Letessier, Anne; Millot, Gael A.; Koundrioukoff, Stephane; Lachages, Anne-Marie; Vogt, Nicolas; Malfoy, Bernard; Brison, Olivier; Debatisse, Michelle] CNRS, UMR 3244, F-75248 Paris, France; [Hansen, R.

However, it is not clear how 53BP1 is specifically targeted to the sites of DNA damage, as the overall level of H4K20me2 does not seem to increase following DNA damage. It has been proposed that DNA breaks may cause exposure of methylated H4K20 previously buried within the chromosome; however, experimental evidence for such a model is lacking. Here we found that H4K20 methylation actually increases locally upon the induction of DSBs and that methylation of H4K20 at DSBs is mediated by the histone methyltransferase MMSET (also known as NSD2 or WHSC1) in mammals. Downregulation of MMSET significantly decreases H4K20 methylation at DSBs and the subsequent accumulation of 53BP1. Furthermore, we found that the recruitment of MMSET to DSBs requires the gamma H2AX-MDC1 pathway; specifically, the interaction between the MDC1 BRCT domain and phosphorylated Ser 102 of MMSET. Thus, we propose that a pathway involving gamma H2AX-MDC1-MMSET regulates the induction of H4K20 methylation on histones around DSBs, which, in turn, facilitates 53BP1 recruitment.","[Pei, Huadong; Luo, Kuntian; Lou, Zhenkun] Mayo Clin, Div Oncol Res, Rochester, MN 55905 USA; [Zhang, Lindsey; Fei, Frances; You, Zhongsheng] Washington Univ, Dept Cell Biol & Physiol, St Louis, MO 63110 USA; [Qin, Yuxin; Wang, Liewei] Mayo Clin, Dept Mol Pharmacol & Expt Therapeut, Rochester, MN 55905 USA; [Chesi, Marta; Bergsagel, P.

Inhibitory avoidance learning leads to an increase in hippocampal expression of IGF-II, which requires the transcription factor CCAAT enhancer binding protein beta and is essential for memory consolidation. Furthermore, injections of recombinant IGF-II into the hippocampus after either training or memory retrieval significantly enhance memory retention and prevent forgetting. To be effective, IGF-II needs to be administered within a sensitive period of memory consolidation. IGF-II-dependent memory enhancement requires IGF-II receptors, new protein synthesis, the function of activity-regulated cytoskeletal-associated protein and glycogen-synthase kinase 3 (GSK3). Moreover, it correlates with a significant activation of synaptic GSK3 beta and increased expression of GluR1 (also known as GRIA1) alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxasolepropionic acid receptor subunits. In hippocampal slices, IGF-II promotes IGF-II receptor-dependent, persistent long-term potentiation after weak synaptic stimulation.

All current models of the molecular circadian clockwork in eukaryotic cells are based on transcription-translation feedback loops. Non-transcriptional mechanisms in the clockwork have been difficult to study in mammalian systems. We circumvented these problems by developing novel assays using human red blood cells, which have no nucleus (or DNA) and therefore cannot perform transcription. Our results show that transcription is not required for circadian oscillations in humans, and that non-transcriptional events seem to be sufficient to sustain cellular circadian rhythms. Using red blood cells, we found that peroxiredoxins, highly conserved antioxidant proteins, undergo similar to 24-hour redox cycles, which persist for many days under constant conditions (that is, in the absence of external cues). Moreover, these rhythms are entrainable (that is, tunable by environmental stimuli) and temperature-compensated, both key features of circadian rhythms. We anticipate that our findings will facilitate more sophisticated cellular clock models, highlighting the interdependency of transcriptional and non-transcriptional oscillations in potentially all eukaryotic cells.","[O'Neill, John S.; Reddy, Akhilesh B.] Univ Cambridge, Addenbrookes Hosp, Inst Metab Sci, Metab Res Labs,Dept Clin Neurosci, Cambridge CB2 0QQ, England","Reddy, AB (reprint author), Univ Cambridge, Addenbrookes Hosp, Inst Metab Sci, Metab Res Labs,Dept Clin Neurosci, Cambridge CB2 0QQ, England.",areddy@cantab.net,,"O'Neill, John/0000-0003-2204-6096",Wellcome Trust [083643/Z/07/Z]; MRC Centre for Obesity and Related metabolic Disorders (MRC CORD); NIHR Cambridge Biomedical Research Centre,"This work was supported by the Wellcome Trust (083643/Z/07/Z), the MRC Centre for Obesity and Related metabolic Disorders (MRC CORD) and the NIHR Cambridge Biomedical Research Centre.

The Hubble Ultra Deep Field (HUDF09) data(2,3) have yielded the first reliable detections of z approximate to 8 galaxies(3-9) that, together with reports of a c-ray burst at z approximate to 8.2 (refs 10, 11), constitute the earliest objects reliably reported to date. Observations of z approximate to 7-8 galaxies suggest substantial star formation at z > 9-10 (refs 12, 13). Here we use the full two-year HUDF09 data to conduct an ultra-deep search for z approximate to 10 galaxies in the heart of the reionization epoch, only 500 Myr after the Big Bang. Not only do we find one possible z approximate to 10 galaxy candidate, but we show that, regardless of source detections, the star formation rate density is much smaller (similar to 10%) at this time than it is just similar to 200 Myr later at z approximate to 8. This demonstrates how rapid galaxy build-up was at z approximate to 10, as galaxies increased in both luminosity density and volume density from z approximate to 10 to z approximate to 8. The 100-200 Myr before z approximate to 10 is clearly a crucial phase in the assembly of the earliest galaxies.","[Bouwens, R. J.; Illingworth, G.

Here we report the demonstration of entanglement between a photon at a telecommunication wavelength (1,338 nm) and a single collective atomic excitation stored in a crystal. One photon from an energy-time entangled pair(5) is mapped onto the crystal and then released into a well-defined spatial mode after a predetermined storage time. The other (telecommunication wavelength) photon is sent directly through a 50-metre fibre link to an analyser. Successful storage of entanglement in the crystal is proved by a violation of the Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt inequality(6) by almost three standard deviations (S=2.64 +/- 0.23).

We assess the entanglement-preserving nature of our storage device through Bell inequality violations(6) and by comparing the amount of entanglement contained in the detected photon pairs before and after the reversible transfer. These measurements show, within statistical error, a perfect mapping process. Our broadband quantum memory complements the family of robust, integrated lithium niobate devices(7). It simplifies frequency-matching of light with matter interfaces in advanced applications of quantum communication, bringing fully quantum-enabled networks a step closer.","[Saglamyurek, Erhan; Sinclair, Neil; Jin, Jeongwan; Slater, Joshua A.; Oblak, Daniel; Bussieres, Felix; Tittel, Wolfgang] Univ Calgary, Inst Quantum Informat Sci, Calgary, AB T2N 1N4, Canada; [Saglamyurek, Erhan; Sinclair, Neil; Jin, Jeongwan; Slater, Joshua A.; Oblak, Daniel; Bussieres, Felix; Tittel, Wolfgang] Univ Calgary, Dept Phys & Astron, Calgary, AB T2N 1N4, Canada; [George, Mathew; Ricken, Raimund; Sohler, Wolfgang] Univ Paderborn, Dept Phys Appl Phys, D-33095 Paderborn, Germany","Tittel, W (reprint author), Univ Calgary, Inst Quantum Informat Sci, 2500 Univ Dr NW, Calgary, AB T2N 1N4, Canada.",wtittel@ucalgary.ca,"Bussieres, Felix/E-5384-2011; Slater, Joshua/F-2523-2011; Tittel, Wolfgang/A-1600-2011","Bussieres, Felix/0000-0003-0234-175X; Oblak, Daniel/0000-0002-0277-3360",NSERC; QuantumWorks; General Dynamics Canada; iCORE (now part of Alberta Innovates); CFI; AAET; FQRNT,"This work is supported by NSERC, QuantumWorks, General Dynamics Canada, iCORE (now part of Alberta Innovates), CFI, AAET and FQRNT.

As an alternative, scanning probe lithography has become a popular means of preparing nanoscale structures, in part owing to its relatively low cost and high resolution, and a registration accuracy that exceeds most existing technologies(1-6). However, increasing the throughput of cantilever-based scanning probe systems while maintaining their resolution and registration advantages has from the outset been a significant challenge(7-17). Even with impressive recent advances in cantilever array design, such arrays tend to be highly specialized for a given application, expensive, and often difficult to implement. It is therefore difficult to imagine commercially viable production methods based on scanning probe systems that rely on conventional cantilevers. Here we describe a low-cost and scalable cantilever-free tip-based nanopatterning method that uses an array of hard silicon tips mounted onto an elastomeric backing. This method-which we term hard-tip, soft-spring lithography-overcomes the throughput problems of cantilever-based scanning probe systems and the resolution limits imposed by the use of elastomeric stamps and tips: it is capable of delivering materials or energy to a surface to create arbitrary patterns of features with sub-50-nm resolution over centimetre-scale areas. We argue that hard-tip, soft-spring lithography is a versatile nanolithography strategy that should be widely adopted by academic and industrial researchers for rapid prototyping applications.","[Shim, Wooyoung; Liao, Xing; Mirkin, Chad A.] Northwestern Univ, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Evanston, IL 60208 USA; [Shim, Wooyoung; Braunschweig, Adam B.; Liao, Xing; Chai, Jinan; Lim, Jong Kuk; Zheng, Gengfeng; Mirkin, Chad A.] Northwestern Univ, Int Inst Nanotechnol, Evanston, IL 60208 USA; [Braunschweig, Adam B.; Chai, Jinan; Lim, Jong Kuk; Zheng, Gengfeng; Mirkin, Chad A.] Northwestern Univ, Dept Chem, Evanston, IL 60208 USA","Mirkin, CA (reprint author), Northwestern Univ, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, 2220 Campus Dr, Evanston, IL 60208 USA.",chadnano@northwestern.edu,"Mirkin, Chad/E-3911-2010; Zheng, Gengfeng/G-7023-2011; Liao, Xing/M-1886-2013","Zheng, Gengfeng/0000-0002-1803-6955; Liao, Xing/0000-0002-0405-1564",US Air Force Office of Scientific Research (AFOSR); US Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA); US NSF; US Department of Defense; US NIH,"C.A.M. acknowledges the US Air Force Office of Scientific Research (AFOSR), the US Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) and the US NSF (NSEC program) for support of this research.

Although some studies suggest that greater melting produces greater ice-sheet acceleration(7,9), others have identified a long-term decrease in Greenland's flow despite increased melting(3). Here we use satellite observations of ice motion recorded in a land-terminating sector of southwest Greenland to investigate the manner in which ice flow develops during years of markedly different melting. Although peak rates of ice speed-up are positively correlated with the degree of melting, mean summer flow rates are not, because glacier slowdown occurs, on average, when a critical run-off threshold of about 1.4 centimetres a day is exceeded. In contrast to the first half of summer, when flow is similar in all years, speed-up during the latter half is 62 +/- 16 per cent less in warmer years. Consequently, in warmer years, the period of fast ice flow is three times shorter and, overall, summer ice flow is slower. This behaviour is at odds with that expected from basal lubrication alone(7,9). Instead, it mirrors that of mountain glaciers(10-12), where melt-induced acceleration of flow ceases during years of high melting once subglacial drainage becomes efficient. A model of ice-sheet flow that captures switching between cavity and channel drainage modes(13) is consistent with the run-off threshold, fast-flow periods, and later-summer speeds we have observed. Simulations of the Greenland ice-sheet flow under climate warming scenarios should account for the dynamic evolution of subglacial drainage; a simple model of basal lubrication alone misses key aspects of the ice sheet's response to climate warming.","[Sundal, Aud Venke; Shepherd, Andrew; Palmer, Steven] Univ Leeds, Sch Earth & Environm, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England; [Nienow, Peter] Univ Edinburgh, Sch Geosci, Edinburgh EH8 9XP, Midlothian, Scotland; [Hanna, Edward] Univ Sheffield, Dept Geog, Sheffield S10 2TN, S Yorkshire, England; [Huybrechts, Philippe] Vrije Univ Brussel, Dept Geog, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium","Shepherd, A (reprint author), Univ Leeds, Sch Earth & Environm, Woodhouse Lane, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England.",a.shepherd@leeds.ac.uk,"Hanna, Edward/H-2219-2016; Palmer, Steven/D-5170-2013","Hanna, Edward/0000-0002-8683-182X; Palmer, Steven/0000-0003-3977-8509; ",UK NERC National Centre for Earth Observation; EU [026],"This work was supported by the UK NERC National Centre for Earth Observation, a Philip Leverhulme Prize to A.S. and by the EU FP7 Ice2Sea project (publ. no. 026).

For instance, the central nervous system (CNS) is subjected to extensive rearrangement because its regulating larval organs are lost and new adult organs are created(1). To understand how the adult CNS is reconstructed, we traced the fate of larval CNS cells during ascidian metamorphosis by using transgenic animals and imaging technologies with photoconvertible fluorescent proteins(2). Here we show that most parts of the ascidian larval CNS, except for the tail nerve cord, are maintained during metamorphosis and recruited to form the adult CNS. We also show that most of the larval neurons disappear and only a subset of cholinergic motor neurons and glutamatergic neurons are retained. Finally, we demonstrate that ependymal cells of the larval CNS contribute to the construction of the adult CNS and that some differentiate into neurons in the adult CNS. An unexpected role of ependymal cells highlighted by this study is that they serve as neural stem-like cells to reconstruct the adult nervous network during chordate metamorphosis. Consequently, the plasticity of non-neuronal ependymal cells and neuronal cells in chordates should be re-examined by future studies(3,4).","[Horie, Takeo; Shinki, Ryoko; Ogura, Yosuke; Sasakura, Yasunori] Univ Tsukuba, Shimoda Marine Res Ctr, Shizuoka 4150025, Japan; [Kusakabe, Takehiro G.] Konan Univ, Dept Biol, Kobe, Hyogo 6588501, Japan; [Satoh, Nori] Sci & Technol Promot Corp, Okinawa Inst, Marine Genom Unit, Okinawa 9040412, Japan","Horie, T (reprint author), Univ Tsukuba, Shimoda Marine Res Ctr, Shizuoka 4150025, Japan.",horie@kurofune.shimoda.tsukuba.ac.jp,"Kusakabe, Takehiro/H-7178-2012","Kusakabe, Takehiro/0000-0002-8325-3665; Ogura, Yosuke/0000-0002-5251-9176",Japan Society for the Promotion of Science; MEXT; National Institute of Genetics,"We acknowledge the members of the Shimoda Marine Research Center at the University of Tsukuba for their cooperation with our study.

The orang-utan species, Pongo abelii (Sumatran) and Pongo pygmaeus (Bornean), are the most phylogenetically distant great apes from humans, thereby providing an informative perspective on hominid evolution. Here we present a Sumatran orang-utan draft genome assembly and short read sequence data from five Sumatran and five Bornean orang-utan genomes. Our analyses reveal that, compared to other primates, the orang-utan genome has many unique features. Structural evolution of the orang-utan genome has proceeded much more slowly than other great apes, evidenced by fewer rearrangements, less segmental duplication, a lower rate of gene family turnover and surprisingly quiescent Alu repeats, which have played a major role in restructuring other primate genomes. We also describe a primate polymorphic neocentromere, found in both Pongo species, emphasizing the gradual evolution of orang-utan genome structure. Orang-utans have extremely low energy usage for a eutherian mammal(1), far lower than their hominid relatives. Adding their genome to the repertoire of sequenced primates illuminates new signals of positive selection in several pathways including glycolipid metabolism. From the population perspective, both Pongo species are deeply diverse; however, Sumatran individuals possess greater diversity than their Bornean counterparts, and more species-specific variation. Our estimate of Bornean/Sumatran speciation time, 400,000 years ago, is more recent than most previous studies and underscores the complexity of the orang-utan speciation process. Despite a smaller modern census population size, the Sumatran effective population size (Ne) expanded exponentially relative to the ancestral Ne after the split, while Bornean Ne declined over the same period. Overall, the resources and analyses presented here offer new opportunities in evolutionary genomics, insights into hominid biology, and an extensive database of variation for conservation efforts.","[Locke, Devin P.; Hillier, LaDeana W.; Warren, Wesley C.; Yang, Shiaw-Pyng; Wang, Zhengyuan; Chinwalla, Asif T.; Minx, Pat; Mitreva, Makedonka; Cook, Lisa; Delehaunty, Kim D.; Fronick, Catrina; Schmidt, Heather; Fulton, Lucinda A.; Fulton, Robert S.; Nelson, Joanne O.; Magrini, Vincent; Pohl, Craig; Graves, Tina A.; Markovic, Chris; Weinstock, George M.; Mardis, Elaine R.; Wilson, Richard K.] Washington Univ, Sch Med, Genome Ctr, St Louis, MO 63108 USA; [Worley, Kim C.; Nazareth, Lynne V.; Muzny, Donna M.; Cree, Andy; Dinh, Huyen H.; Hume, Jennifer; Kovar, Christie L.; Fowler, Gerald R.; Rogers, Jeffrey; Gibbs, Richard A.] Baylor Coll Med, Dept Mol & Human Genet, Human Genome Sequencing Ctr, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Lunter, Gerton; Meader, Stephen; Heger, Andreas; Ponting, Chris P.] Univ Oxford, MRC, Funct Genom Unit, Oxford OX1 3QX, England; [Lunter, Gerton; Meader, Stephen; Heger, Andreas; Ponting, Chris P.] Univ Oxford, Dept Physiol Anat & Genet, Oxford OX1 3QX, England; [Lunter, Gerton] Wellcome Trust Ctr Human Genet, Oxford OX3 7BN, England; [Marques-Bonet, Tomas; Alkan, Can; Chen, Lin; Cheng, Ze; Kidd, Jeffrey M.; Eichler, Evan E.] Univ Washington, Sch Med, Dept Genome Sci, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Marques-Bonet, Tomas; Faria, Rui; Fernando, Olga; Darre, Fleur; Farre, Domenec; Gazave, Elodie; Oliva, Meritxell; Navarro, Arcadi] Univ Pompeu Fabra, PRBB, CSIC, IBE, Barcelona 08003, Spain; [Eichler, Evan E.] Univ Washington, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [White, Simon; Searle, Stephen] Wellcome Trust Sanger Inst, Cambridge CB10 1SA, England; [Vilella, Albert J.; Chen, Yuan; Flicek, Paul; Herrero, Javier] European Bioinformat Inst, Cambridge CB10 1SD, England; [Ma, Jian; Raney, Brian; Suh, Bernard; Haussler, David] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Ctr Biomol Sci & Engn, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA; [Burhans, Richard; Ratan, Aakrosh; Harris, Robert S.; Miller, Webb] Penn State Univ, Ctr Comparat Genom & Bioinformat, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Faria, Rui] Univ Porto, Ctr Invest Biodiversidade & Recursos Genet, CIBIO, P-4485661 Vairao, Portugal; [Fernando, Olga] Univ Nova Lisboa, Inst Tecnol Quim & Biol, P-2780157 Oeiras, Portugal; [Navarro, Arcadi] ICREA, Barcelona 08003, Spain; [Navarro, Arcadi] PRBB, INB, Barcelona 08003, Spain; [Roberto, Roberta; Capozzi, Oronzo; Archidiacono, Nicoletta; Rocchi, Mariano] Univ Bari, Dept Biol, I-70125 Bari, Italy; [Della Valle, Giuliano; Purgato, Stefania] Univ Bologna, Dept Biol, I-40126 Bologna, Italy; [Konkel, Miriam K.; Walker, Jerilyn A.; Batzer, Mark A.] Louisiana State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA; [Ullmer, Brygg] Louisiana State Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Ctr Computat & Technol, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA; [Smit, Arian F.

When the two parental alleles are unequally represented within a social group (when there is sex bias in dispersal and/or variance in reproductive success)(5,6), imprinted genes may evolve to modulate social behaviour, although so far no such instance is known. Predominantly expressed from the maternal allele during embryogenesis, Grb10 encodes an intracellular adaptor protein that can interact with several receptor tyrosine kinases and downstream signalling molecules(7). Here we demonstrate that within the brain Grb10 is expressed from the paternal allele from fetal life into adulthood and that ablation of this expression engenders increased social dominance specifically among other aspects of social behaviour, a finding supported by the observed increase in allogrooming by paternal Grb10-deficient animals. Grb10 is, therefore, the first example of an imprinted gene that regulates social behaviour. It is also currently alone in exhibiting imprinted expression from each of the parental alleles in a tissue-specific manner, as loss of the peripherally expressed maternal allele leads to significant fetal and placental overgrowth. Thus Grb10 is, so far, a unique imprinted gene, able to influence distinct physiological processes, fetal growth and adult behaviour, owing to actions of the two parental alleles in different tissues.","[Garfield, Alastair S.; Cowley, Michael; Smith, Florentia M.; Moorwood, Kim; Stewart-Cox, Joanne E.; Hurst, Laurence D.; Ward, Andrew] Univ Bath, Dept Biol & Biochem, Bath BA2 7AY, Avon, England; [Garfield, Alastair S.; Cowley, Michael; Smith, Florentia M.; Moorwood, Kim; Stewart-Cox, Joanne E.; Hurst, Laurence D.; Ward, Andrew] Univ Bath, Ctr Regenerat Med, Bath BA2 7AY, Avon, England; [Garfield, Alastair S.; Gilroy, Kerry; Baker, Sian; Wilkinson, Lawrence S.; Isles, Anthony R.] Cardiff Univ, Sch Med, Neurosci & Mental Hlth Res Inst, MRC,Ctr Neuropsychiat Genet & Genom,Behav Genet G, Cardiff CF14 4XN, S Glam, Wales; [Garfield, Alastair S.; Gilroy, Kerry; Baker, Sian; Wilkinson, Lawrence S.; Isles, Anthony R.] Cardiff Univ, Sch Psychol, Neurosci & Mental Hlth Res Inst, MRC,Ctr Neuropsychiat Genet & Genom,Behav Genet G, Cardiff CF14 4XN, S Glam, Wales; [Xia, Jing; Dalley, Jeffrey W.] Univ Cambridge, Behav & Clin Neurosci Inst, Cambridge CB2 3EB, England; [Xia, Jing; Dalley, Jeffrey W.] Univ Cambridge, Dept Expt Psychol, Cambridge CB2 3EB, England; [Dalley, Jeffrey W.] Univ Cambridge, Addenbrookes Hosp, Dept Psychiat, Cambridge CB2 2QQ, England","Ward, A (reprint author), Univ Bath, Dept Biol & Biochem, Claverton Down, Bath BA2 7AY, Avon, England.",bssaw@bath.ac.uk,"Hurst, Laurence/F-9215-2010; Cowley, Mike/B-9425-2013","Hurst, Laurence/0000-0002-1002-1054; Cowley, Michael/0000-0001-8564-4224; Moorwood, Kim/0000-0003-0943-6161; Isles, Anthony/0000-0002-7587-5712",Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council; Medical Research Council; Wellcome Trust,"We thank S.

A recent large-scale screen of similar to 3,500 genes by PCR-based exon re-sequencing identified several new cancer genes in ccRCC including UTX (also known as KDM6A)(1), JARID1C (also known as KDM5C) and SETD2 (ref. 2). These genes encode enzymes that demethylate (UTX, JARID1C) or methylate (SETD2) key lysine residues of histone H3. Modification of the methylation state of these lysine residues of histone H3 regulates chromatin structure and is implicated in transcriptional control(3). However, together these mutations are present in fewer than 15% of ccRCC, suggesting the existence of additional, currently unidentified cancer genes. Here, we have sequenced the protein coding exome in a series of primary ccRCC and report the identification of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodelling complex gene PBRM1 (ref. 4) as a second major ccRCC cancer gene, with truncating mutations in 41% (92/227) of cases. These data further elucidate the somatic genetic architecture of ccRCC and emphasize the marked contribution of aberrant chromatin biology.","[Huang, Dachuan; Ong, Choon Kiat; Chan-on, Waraporn; Subimerb, Chutima; Teh, Bin Tean] Natl Canc Ctr Singapore, NCCS VARI Translat Res Lab, Singapore 169610, Singapore; [Varela, Ignacio; Tarpey, Patrick; Raine, Keiran; Stephens, Philip; Davies, Helen; Jones, David; Lin, Meng-Lay; Teague, Jon; Bignell, Graham; Butler, Adam; Cho, Juok; Dalgliesh, Gillian L.; Galappaththige, Danushka; Greenman, Chris; Hardy, Claire; Jia, Mingming; Latimer, Calli; Lau, King Wai; Marshall, John; McLaren, Stuart; Menzies, Andrew; Mudie, Laura; Stebbings, Lucy; Campbell, Peter J.; Stratton, Michael R.; Futreal, P.

Among the most distinctive benefits of bifidobacteria are modulation of host defence responses and protection against infectious diseases(4-6). Nevertheless, the molecular mechanisms underlying these effects have barely been elucidated. To investigate these mechanisms, we used mice associated with certain bifidobacterial strains and a simplified model of lethal infection with enterohaemorrhagic Escherichia coli O157:H7, together with an integrated 'omics' approach. Here we show that genes encoding an ATP-binding-cassette-type carbohydrate transporter present in certain bifidobacteria contribute to protecting mice against death induced by E. coli O157:H7. We found that this effect can be attributed, at least in part, to increased production of acetate and that translocation of the E. coli O157:H7 Shiga toxin from the gut lumen to the blood was inhibited. We propose that acetate produced by protective bifidobacteria improves intestinal defence mediated by epithelial cells and thereby protects the host against lethal infection.","[Fukuda, Shinji; Hase, Koji; Nakanishi, Yumiko; Ohno, Hiroshi] RIKEN Res Ctr Allergy & Immunol, Lab Epithelial Immunobiol, Tsurumi Ku, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2300045, Japan; [Fukuda, Shinji; Nakanishi, Yumiko; Kikuchi, Jun; Ohno, Hiroshi] Yokohama City Univ, Grad Sch Nanobiosci, Tsurumi Ku, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2300045, Japan; [Toh, Hidehiro; Taylor, Todd D.] RIKEN Adv Sci Inst, MetaSyst Res Team, Tsurumi Ku, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2300045, Japan; [Oshima, Kenshiro; Hattori, Masahira] Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Frontier Sci, Chiba 2778561, Japan; [Nakanishi, Yumiko; Kikuchi, Jun] RIKEN Plant Sci Ctr, Adv NMR Metab Res Team, Tsurumi Ku, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2300045, Japan; [Yoshimura, Kazutoshi; Itoh, Kikuji] Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Agr & Life Sci, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo 1138657, Japan; [Tobe, Toru] Osaka Univ, Grad Sch Med, Suita, Osaka 5650871, Japan; [Clarke, Julie M.; Topping, David L.] CSIRO Food & Nutr Sci, Adelaide, SA 5000, Australia; [Suzuki, Tohru] Gifu Univ, United Grad Sch Agr Sci, Gifu 5011193, Japan; [Kikuchi, Jun] Nagoya Univ, Grad Sch Bioagr Sci, Chikusa Ku, Nagoya, Aichi 4648601, Japan; [Morita, Hidetoshi] Azabu Univ, Sch Vet Med, Kanagawa 2298501, Japan; [Ohno, Hiroshi] Chiba Univ, Grad Sch Med, Chuo Ku, Chiba 2608670, Japan","Ohno, H (reprint author), RIKEN Res Ctr Allergy & Immunol, Lab Epithelial Immunobiol, Tsurumi Ku, 1-7-22 Suehiro Cho, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2300045, Japan.",hattori@k.u-tokyo.ac.jp; ohno@rcai.riken.jp,"Taylor, Todd/A-7121-2009; topping, david/H-7969-2013; Clarke, Julie/H-6762-2013; Ohno, Hiroshi/L-7899-2014; Hattori, Masahira/C-6958-2016; Kikuchi, Jun/M-5512-2015","Taylor, Todd/0000-0003-4247-6253; topping, david/0000-0002-8481-9384; Clarke, Julie/0000-0003-4676-0366; Ohno, Hiroshi/0000-0001-8776-9661; Hattori, Masahira/0000-0001-9467-0344; Kikuchi, Jun/0000-0002-6809-394X","Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology of Japan; Japan Science and Technology Agency; Danone Institute of Japan; Institute for Fermentation, Osaka; Kieikai Research Foundation; Naito Foundation; Nestle Nutrition Council, Japan; Japan Science Society; Yakult Bio-Science Foundation; Academic Frontier Project for Private Universities (Matching Fund Subsidy); Private University Scientific Foundation","We thank H.

We have experimentally validated these epidemiological findings using the hepatocyte growth factor/scatter factor transgenic mouse model, which develops lesions in stages highly reminiscent of human melanoma with respect to biological, genetic and aetiological criteria, but only when irradiated as neonatal pups with UVB, not UVA(3,4). However, the mechanisms underlying UVB-initiated, neonatal-specific melanomagenesis remain largely unknown. Here we introduce a mouse model permitting fluorescence-aided melanocyte imaging and isolation following in vivo UV irradiation. We use expression profiling to show that activated neonatal skin melanocytes isolated following a melanomagenic UVB dose bear a distinct, persistent interferon response signature, including genes associated with immunoevasion. UVB-induced melanocyte activation, characterized by aberrant growth and migration, was abolished by antibody-mediated systemic blockade of interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), but not type-I interferons. IFN-gamma was produced by macrophages recruited to neonatal skin by UVB-induced ligands to the chemokine receptor Ccr2. Admixed recruited skin macrophages enhanced transplanted melanoma growth by inhibiting apoptosis; notably, IFN-gamma blockade abolished macrophage-enhanced melanoma growth and survival. IFN-gamma-producing macrophages were also identified in 70% of human melanomas examined. Our data reveal an unanticipated role for IFN-gamma in promoting melanocytic cell survival/immunoevasion, identifying a novel candidate therapeutic target for a subset of melanoma patients.","[Zaidi, M.

This daily timekeeping is thought to be driven by transcriptional-translational feedback loops, whereby rhythmic expression of 'clock' gene products regulates the expression of associated genes in approximately 24-hour cycles. The specific transcriptional components differ between phylogenetic kingdoms(3). The unicellular pico-eukaryotic alga Ostreococcus tauri possesses a naturally minimized clock, which includes many features that are shared with plants, such as a central negative feedback loop that involves the morning-expressed CCA1 and evening-expressed TOC1 genes(4). Given that recent observations in animals and plants have revealed prominent post-translational contributions to time-keeping(5), a reappraisal of the transcriptional contribution to oscillator function is overdue. Here we show that non-transcriptional mechanisms are sufficient to sustain circadian timekeeping in the eukaryotic lineage, although they normally function in conjunction with transcriptional components. We identify oxidation of peroxiredoxin proteins as a transcription-independent rhythmic biomarker, which is also rhythmic in mammals(6). Moreover we show that pharmacological modulators of the mammalian clock mechanism have the same effects on rhythms in Ostreococcus. Post-translational mechanisms, and at least one rhythmic marker, seem to be better conserved than transcriptional clock regulators. It is plausible that the oldest oscillator components are non-transcriptional in nature, as in cyanobacteria(7), and are conserved across kingdoms.","[O'Neill, John S.; Reddy, Akhilesh B.] Univ Cambridge, Metab Res Labs, Addenbrookes Hosp, Inst Metab Sci,Dept Clin Neurosci, Cambridge CB2 0QQ, England; [O'Neill, John S.; van Ooijen, Gerben; Dixon, Laura E.; Millar, Andrew J.] Ctr Syst Biol Edinburgh, Edinburgh EH9 3JD, Midlothian, Scotland; [Troein, Carl; Millar, Andrew J.] Univ Edinburgh, Sch Biol Sci, Edinburgh EH9 3JH, Midlothian, Scotland; [Corellou, Florence; Bouget, Francois-Yves] Univ Paris 06, UMR7621, Lab Oceanog Microbienne, Observ Oceanol, F-66651 Banyuls Sur Mer, France; [Corellou, Florence; Bouget, Francois-Yves] CNRS, UMR7621, Lab Observ Oceanog Microbienne, Observ Oceanol, F-66651 Banyuls Sur Mer, France","Reddy, AB (reprint author), Univ Cambridge, Metab Res Labs, Addenbrookes Hosp, Inst Metab Sci,Dept Clin Neurosci, Cambridge CB2 0QQ, England.",areddy@cantab.net; Andrew.Millar@ed.ac.uk,"Corellou, Florence/E-1378-2011; van Ooijen, Gerben/E-9371-2013; Millar, Andrew/G-2423-2012","van Ooijen, Gerben/0000-0001-7967-0637; Millar, Andrew/0000-0003-1756-3654; O'Neill, John/0000-0003-2204-6096",BBSRC; EPSRC [D019621]; BBSRC/ANR [F005466]; HFSP; Wellcome Trust [083643/Z/07/Z]; MRC Centre for Obesity and Related metabolic Disorders (MRC CORD),CSBE is a Centre for Integrative Systems Biology funded by BBSRC and EPSRC award D019621.

Despite many studies of C/D RNP structure(8-25), the fundamental questions of how C/D RNAs assemble into RNPs and how they guide modification remain unresolved. Here we report the crystal structure of an entire catalytically active archaeal C/D RNP consisting of a bipartite C/D RNA associated with two substrates and two copies each of Nop5, L7Ae and fibrillarin at 3.15-angstrom resolution. The substrate pairs with the second through the eleventh nucleotide of the 12-nucleotide guide, and the resultant duplex is bracketed in a channel with flexible ends. The methyltransferase fibrillarin binds to an undistorted A-form structure of the guide-substrate duplex and specifically loads the target ribose into the active site. Because interaction with the RNA duplex alone does not determine the site specificity, fibrillarin is further positioned by non-specific and specific protein interactions. Compared with the structure of the inactive C/D RNP, extensive domain movements are induced by substrate loading. Our results reveal the organization of a monomeric C/D RNP and the mechanism underlying its site-specific methylation activity.","[Lin, Jinzhong; Lai, Shaomei; Jia, Ru; Xu, Anbi; Zhang, Liman; Lu, Jing; Ye, Keqiong] Natl Inst Biol Sci, Beijing 102206, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Liman; Lu, Jing] Chinese Acad Med Sci, Grad Program, Beijing 100730, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Liman; Lu, Jing] Peking Union Med Coll, Beijing 100730, Peoples R China","Ye, KQ (reprint author), Natl Inst Biol Sci, Beijing 102206, Peoples R China.",yekeqiong@nibs.ac.cn,"Lin, Jinzhong/I-9131-2016",,Chinese Ministry of Science and Technology [2008AA022310]; Beijing Municipal Government,We are grateful to the staff at the Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility beamline BL17U for assistance in data collection and to B.

OGT catalyses the transfer of N-acetylglucosamine from UDP-N-acetylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc) to serines and threonines of cytoplasmic, nuclear and mitochondrial proteins(2,3), including numerous transcription factors(4), tumour suppressors, kinases(5), phosphatases(1) and histone-modifying proteins(6). Aberrant glycosylation by OGT has been linked to insulin resistance(7), diabetic complications(8), cancer(9) and neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's(10). Despite the importance of OGT, the details of how it recognizes and glycosylates its protein substrates are largely unknown. We report here two crystal structures of human OGT, as a binary complex with UDP (2.8 angstrom resolution) and as a ternary complex with UDP and a peptide substrate (1.95 angstrom). The structures provide clues to the enzyme mechanism, show how OGT recognizes target peptide sequences, and reveal the fold of the unique domain between the two halves of the catalytic region. This information will accelerate the rational design of biological experiments to investigate OGT's functions; it will also help the design of inhibitors for use as cellular probes and help to assess its potential as a therapeutic target.","[Lazarus, Michael B.; Jiang, Jiaoyang; Walker, Suzanne] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Microbiol & Mol Genet, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Lazarus, Michael B.] Harvard Univ, Dept Chem & Chem Biol, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Nam, Yunsun; Sliz, Piotr] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Biol Chem & Mol Pharmacol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Nam, Yunsun; Sliz, Piotr] Childrens Hosp, Mol Med Lab, Boston, MA 02115 USA","Walker, S (reprint author), Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Microbiol & Mol Genet, Boston, MA 02115 USA.",piotr_sliz@hms.harvard.edu; suzanne_walker@hms.harvard.edu,,"Sliz, Piotr/0000-0002-6522-0835",US National Institutes of Health; US National Science Foundation; Harvard Biomedical Accelerator Fund,"We thank B.

By multiplexing fluorescence in situ hybridization probes for these mutations, up to eight genetic abnormalities can be detected in single cells, a genetic signature of subclones identified and a composite picture of subclonal architecture and putative ancestral trees assembled. Subclones in acute lymphoblastic leukaemia have variegated genetics and complex, nonlinear or branching evolutionary histories. Copy number alterations are independently and reiteratively acquired in subclones of individual patients, and in no preferential order. Clonal architecture is dynamic and is subject to change in the lead-upto a diagnosis and in relapse. Leukaemia propagating cells, assayed by serial transplantation in NOD/SCID IL2R gamma(null) mice, are also genetically variegated, mirroring subclonal patterns, and vary in competitive regenerative capacity in vivo.

Reconstructing the subclonal genetic ancestry of several samples by CNA profiling demonstrated a branching multi-clonal evolution model of leukaemogenesis, rather than linear succession. For some patient samples, the predominant diagnostic clone repopulated xenografts, whereas in others it was outcompeted by minor subclones. Reconstitution with the predominant diagnosis clone was associated with more aggressive growth properties in xenografts, deletion of CDKN2A and CDKN2B, and a trend towards poorer patient outcome.

Dissection of these pathways requires strategies for precisely following transcripts as they are being produced. Here we present an approach (native elongating transcript sequencing, NET-seq), based on deep sequencing of 3' ends of nascent transcripts associated with RNA polymerase, to monitor transcription at nucleotide resolution. Application of NET-seq in Saccharomyces cerevisiae reveals that although promoters are generally capable of divergent transcription, the Rpd3S deacetylation complex enforces strong directionality to most promoters by suppressing antisense transcript initiation. Our studies also reveal pervasive polymerase pausing and backtracking throughout the body of transcripts. Average pause density shows prominent peaks at each of the first four nucleosomes, with the peak location occurring in good agreement with in vitro biophysical measurements. Thus, nucleosome-induced pausing represents a major barrier to transcriptional elongation in vivo.","[Churchman, L.

In contrast, they seem not to correlate with galaxy disks(1). Disk-grown 'pseudobulges' are intermediate in properties between bulges and disks(6); it has been unclear whether they do(1,5) or do not(7-9) correlate with black holes in the same way that bulges do. At stake in this issue are conclusions about which parts of galaxies coevolve with black holes(10), possibly by being regulated by energy feedback from black holes(11). Here we report pseudobulge classifications for galaxies with dynamically detected black holes and combine them with recent measurements of velocity dispersions in the biggest bulgeless galaxies(12). These data confirm that black holes do not correlate with disks and show that they correlate little or not at all with pseudobulges. We suggest that there are two different modes of black-hole feeding. Black holes in bulges grow rapidly to high masses when mergers drive gas infall that feeds quasar-like events. In contrast, small black holes in bulgeless galaxies and in galaxies with pseudobulges grow as low-level Seyfert galaxies.

Together with the observation that bigger black holes live in bigger bulges(1-4), this has led to the belief that black-hole growth and bulge formation regulate each other(5). That is, black holes and bulges coevolve. Therefore, reports(6,7) of a similar correlation between black holes and the dark matter haloes in which visible galaxies are embedded have profound implications. Dark matter is likely to be non-baryonic, so these reports suggest that unknown, exotic physics controls black-hole growth. Here we show, in part on the basis of recent measurements(8) of bulgeless galaxies, that there is almost no correlation between dark matter and parameters that measure black holes unless the galaxy also contains a bulge. We conclude that black holes do not correlate directly with dark matter. They do not correlate with galaxy disks, either(9,10). Therefore, black holes coevolve only with bulges. This simplifies the puzzle of their coevolution by focusing attention on purely baryonic processes in the galaxy mergers that make bulges(11).","[Kormendy, John] Univ Texas Austin, Dept Astron, Austin, TX 78712 USA; [Kormendy, John; Bender, Ralf] Max Planck Inst Extraterr Phys, D-85748 Garching, Germany; [Kormendy, John; Bender, Ralf] Univ Sternwarte, D-81679 Munich, Germany","Kormendy, J (reprint author), Univ Texas Austin, Dept Astron, 1 Univ Stn, Austin, TX 78712 USA.",kormendy@astro.as.utexas.edu,,,National Science Foundation,"We thank S.

In fields such as crystal engineering(1) and the design of porous materials(2-4), this typically involves building blocks of organic molecules, sometimes operating together with metallic ions or clusters. The translation of such ideas to nanoparticles and colloidal-sized building blocks would potentially open doors to new materials and new properties(5-7), but the pathways to achieve this goal are still undetermined. Here we show how colloidal spheres can be induced to self-assemble into a complex predetermined colloidal crystal-in this case a colloidal kagome lattice(8-12)-through decoration of their surfaces with a simple pattern of hydrophobic domains. The building blocks are simple micrometre-sized spheres with interactions (electrostatic repulsion in the middle, hydrophobic attraction at the poles, which we call 'triblock Janus') that are also simple, but the self-assembly of the spheres into an open kagome structure contrasts with previously known close-packed periodic arrangements of spheres(13-15). This open network is of interest for several theoretical reasons(8-10). With a view to possible enhanced functionality, the resulting lattice structure possesses two families of pores, one that is hydrophobic on the rims of the pores and another that is hydrophilic. This strategy of 'convergent' self-assembly from easily fabricated(16) colloidal building blocks encodes the target supracolloidal architecture, not in localized attractive spots but instead in large redundantly attractive regions, and can be extended to form other supracolloidal networks.","[Chen, Qian; Bae, Sung Chul; Granick, Steve] Univ Illinois, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Granick, Steve] Univ Illinois, Dept Chem, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Granick, Steve] Univ Illinois, Dept Phys, Urbana, IL 61801 USA","Granick, S (reprint author), Univ Illinois, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, 1304 W Green St, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.",sgranick@illinois.edu,"Bae, Sung/A-3423-2008; Chen, Qian/A-6535-2011; Chen, Qian/E-9624-2014","Bae, Sung/0000-0002-9765-6801; ","US Department of Energy, Division of Materials Science through the Frederick Seitz Materials Research Laboratory at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign [DE-FG02-07ER46471]","This work was supported by the US Department of Energy, Division of Materials Science, under award number DE-FG02-07ER46471 through the Frederick Seitz Materials Research Laboratory at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.

This phenomenon, called the surface enhancement effect(1,2), has a broad range of potential applications, such as the detection of weak chemical signals. Hotspots are believed to be associated with localized electromagnetic modes(3,4), caused by the randomness of the surface texture. Probing the electromagnetic field of the hotspots would offer much insight towards uncovering the mechanism generating the enhancement; however, it requires a spatial resolution of 1-2 nm, which has been a long-standing challenge in optics. The resolution of an optical microscope is limited to about half the wavelength of the incident light, approximately 200-300 nm. Although current state-of-the-art techniques, including near-field scanning optical microscopy(5), electron energy-loss spectroscopy(6), cathode luminescence imaging(7) and two-photon photoemission imaging(8) have subwavelength resolution, they either introduce a non-negligible amount of perturbation, complicating interpretation of the data, or operate only in a vacuum. As a result, after more than 30 years since the discovery of the surface enhancement effect(9-11), how the local field is distributed remains unknown. Here we present a technique that uses Brownian motion of single molecules to probe the local field. It enables two-dimensional imaging of the fluorescence enhancement profile of single hotspots on the surfaces of aluminium thin films and silver nanoparticle clusters, with accuracy down to 1.2 nm. Strong fluorescence enhancements, up to 54 and 136 times respectively, are observed in those two systems. This strong enhancement indicates that the local field, which decays exponentially from the peak of a hotspot, dominates the fluorescence enhancement profile.","[Cang, Hu; Yin, Xiaobo; Zhang, Xiang] Univ Calif Berkeley, Lawrence Berkeley Lab, Div Mat Sci, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Cang, Hu; Labno, Anna; Lu, Changgui; Yin, Xiaobo; Liu, Ming; Gladden, Christopher; Liu, Yongmin; Zhang, Xiang] Univ Calif Berkeley, NSF Nano Scale Sci & Engn Ctr, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Labno, Anna] Univ Calif Berkeley, Biophys Program, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA","Zhang, X (reprint author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Lawrence Berkeley Lab, Div Mat Sci, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",xiang@berkeley.edu,"Liu, Yongmin/F-5322-2010; Yin, Xiaobo/A-4142-2011",,"US Department of Energy Office of Science, Basic Energy Sciences and Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory [DE-AC02-05CH11231]","We thank G.

These effects should be especially pronounced in two-dimensional materials, where even a line defect can divide and disrupt a crystal. These issues take on practical significance in graphene, which is a hexagonal, two-dimensional crystal of carbon atoms. Single-atom-thick graphene sheets can now be produced by chemical vapour deposition(1-3) on scales of up to metres(4), making their polycrystallinity almost unavoidable. Theoretically, graphene grain boundaries are predicted to have distinct electronic(5-8), magnetic(9), chemical(10) and mechanical(11-13) properties that strongly depend on their atomic arrangement. Yet because of the five-order-of-magnitude size difference between grains and the atoms at grain boundaries, few experiments have fully explored the graphene grain structure. Here we use a combination of old and new transmission electron microscopy techniques to bridge these length scales. Using atomic-resolution imaging, we determine the location and identity of every atom at a grain boundary and find that different grains stitch together predominantly through pentagon-heptagon pairs. Rather than individually imaging the several billion atoms in each grain, we use diffraction-filtered imaging(14) to rapidly map the location, orientation and shape of several hundred grains and boundaries, where only a handful have been previously reported(15-19). The resulting images reveal an unexpectedly small and intricate patchwork of grains connected by tilt boundaries. By correlating grain imaging with scanning probe and transport measurements, we show that these grain boundaries severely weaken the mechanical strength of graphene membranes but do not as drastically alter their electrical properties. These techniques open a new window for studies on the structure, properties and control of grains and grain boundaries in graphene and other two-dimensional materials.","[Huang, Pinshane Y.; Ruiz-Vargas, Carlos S.; Alden, Jonathan S.; Zhu, Ye; Muller, David A.] Cornell Univ, Sch Appl & Engn Phys, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [van der Zande, Arend M.; Whitney, William S.; McEuen, Paul L.] Cornell Univ, Dept Phys, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Levendorf, Mark P.; Garg, Shivank; Park, Jiwoong] Cornell Univ, Dept Chem & Chem Biol, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Kevek, Joshua W.] Oregon State Univ, Dept Phys, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA; [Hustedt, Caleb J.] Brigham Young Univ, Dept Phys & Astron, Provo, UT 84602 USA; [Park, Jiwoong; McEuen, Paul L.; Muller, David A.] Kavli Inst Cornell Nanoscale Sci, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA","Muller, DA (reprint author), Cornell Univ, Sch Appl & Engn Phys, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",david.a.muller@cornell.edu,"Zhu, Ye/A-1844-2011; Park, Jiwoong/C-2327-2013; van der Zande, Arend/C-1989-2016; Muller, David/A-7745-2010","Zhu, Ye/0000-0002-5217-493X; van der Zande, Arend/0000-0001-5104-9646; Muller, David/0000-0003-4129-0473; Huang, Pinshane/0000-0002-1095-1833","National Science Foundation through the Cornell Center for Materials Research; Nanoscale Science and Engineering Initiative of the National Science Foundation [EEC-0117770, 064654]; NSF","The authors acknowledge discussions with M.

A handful of animals, notably the fungus-growing ants, termites and ambrosia beetles(2-4), have advanced agriculture that involves dispersal and seeding of food propagules, cultivation of the crop and sustainable harvesting(5). More primitive examples, which could be called husbandry because they involve fewer adaptations, include marine snails farming intertidal fungi(6) and damsel-fish farming algae(7). Recent work has shown that microorganisms are surprisingly like animals in having sophisticated behaviours such as cooperation, communication(8,9) and recognition(10,11), as well as many kinds of symbiosis(12-15). Here we show that the social amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum has a primitive farming symbiosis that includes dispersal and prudent harvesting of the crop. About one-third of wild-collected clones engage in husbandry of bacteria. Instead of consuming all bacteria in their patch, they stop feeding early and incorporate bacteria into their fruiting bodies. They then carry bacteria during spore dispersal and can seed a new food crop, which is a major advantage if edible bacteria are lacking at the new site. However, if they arrive at sites already containing appropriate bacteria, the costs of early feeding cessation are not compensated for, which may account for the dichotomous nature of this farming symbiosis. The striking convergent evolution between bacterial husbandry in social amoebas and fungus farming in social insects makes sense because multigenerational benefits of farming go to already established kin groups.","[Brock, Debra A.; Douglas, Tracy E.; Queller, David C.; Strassmann, Joan E.] Rice Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Houston, TX 77005 USA","Brock, DA (reprint author), Rice Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, 6100 Main St, Houston, TX 77005 USA.",dbrock@rice.edu,,"Strassmann, Joan/0000-0003-0638-8440",US National Science Foundation,"We thank J.

According to the dominant model of hippocampal cell assembly activity, place cell firing order is established for the first time during exploration, to encode the spatial experience, and is subsequently replayed during rest(3-6) or slow-wave sleep(7-10) for consolidation of the encoded experience(11,12). Here we report that temporal sequences of firing of place cells expressed during a novel spatial experience occurred on a significant number of occasions during the resting or sleeping period preceding the experience. This phenomenon, which is called preplay, occurred in disjunction with sequences of replay of a familiar experience.

The direction-selective circuit in the retina relies upon highly selective wiring of inhibitory inputs from starburst amacrine cells(1) (SACs) onto four subtypes of ON-OFF direction-selective ganglion cells (DSGCs), each preferring motion in one of four cardinal directions(2). It has been reported in rabbit that the SACs on the 'null' sides of DSGCs form functional GABA (c-aminobutyric acid)-mediated synapses, whereas those on the preferred sides do not(3). However, it is not known how the asymmetric wiring between SACs and DSGCs is established during development. Here we report that in transgenic mice with cell-type-specific labelling, the synaptic connections from SACs to DSGCs were of equal strength during the first postnatal week, regardless of whether the SAC was located on the preferred or null side of the DSGC. However, by the end of the second postnatal week, the strength of the synapses made from SACs on the null side of a DSGC significantly increased whereas those made from SACs located on the preferred side remained constant. Blocking retinal activity by intraocular injections of muscimol or gabazine during this period did not alter the development of direction selectivity. Hence, the asymmetric inhibition between the SACs and DSGCs is achieved by a developmental program that specifically strengthens the GABA-mediated inputs from SACs located on the null side, in a manner not dependent on neural activity.","[Wei, Wei; Hamby, Aaron M.; Zhou, Kaili; Feller, Marla B.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mol & Cell Biol, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Feller, Marla B.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Helen Wills Neurosci Inst, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA","Feller, MB (reprint author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mol & Cell Biol, 229 Stanley Hall, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",mfeller@berkeley.edu,,,"National Institutes of Health [RO1EY013528, ARRA EY019498]","We thank S.

A key circuit module of directionally selective (DS) retinal ganglion cells is a spatially asymmetric inhibitory input from starburst amacrine cells(3-5). It is not known how and when this circuit asymmetry is established during development. Here we photostimulate mouse starburst cells targeted with channelrhodopsin-2 (refs 6-8) while recording from a single genetically labelled type of DS cell(9,10). We follow the spatial distribution of synaptic strengths between starburst and DS cells during early postnatal development before these neurons can respond to a physiological light stimulus, and confirm connectivity by monosynaptically restricted trans-synaptic rabies viral tracing. We show that asymmetry develops rapidly over a 2-day period through an intermediate state in which random or symmetric synaptic connections have been established. The development of asymmetry involves the spatially selective reorganization of inhibitory synaptic inputs. Intriguingly, the spatial distribution of excitatory synaptic inputs from starburst cells is significantly more symmetric than that of the inhibitory inputs at the end of this developmental period. Our work demonstrates a rapid developmental switch from a symmetric to asymmetric input distribution for inhibition in the neural circuit of a principal cell.","[Yonehara, Keisuke; Balint, Kamill; Roska, Botond] Friedrich Miescher Inst Biomed Res, Neural Circuit Labs, CH-4058 Basel, Switzerland; [Noda, Masaharu] Natl Inst Basic Biol, Div Mol Neurobiol, Okazaki, Aichi 4448787, Japan; [Noda, Masaharu] Grad Univ Adv Studies, Sch Life Sci, Okazaki, Aichi 4448787, Japan; [Nagel, Georg] Univ Wurzburg, D-97082 Wurzburg, Germany; [Bamberg, Ernst] Max Planck Inst Biophys, D-60438 Frankfurt, Germany; [Bamberg, Ernst] Goethe Univ Frankfurt, Inst Biophys Chem, D-60438 Frankfurt, Germany","Roska, B (reprint author), Friedrich Miescher Inst Biomed Res, Neural Circuit Labs, CH-4058 Basel, Switzerland.",botond.roska@fmi.ch,,"Nagel, Georg/0000-0001-8174-8712; Yonehara, Keisuke/0000-0001-9541-6671",Friedrich Miescher Institute for Biomedical Research; US Office of Naval Research; Marie Curie Excellence grant; National Centre of Competence in Research; European Research Council; European Union; EMBO,"We thank B.

Discerning the number and distribution of genes underlying these traits and, in a few cases, identifying the genes involved, has greatly enhanced our understanding over the past 15 years of species formation (reviewed by Noor and Feder(1) and Wolf et al.(2)). However, this work has almost exclusively focused on traits that restrict gene flow between populations that have evolved as a by-product of genetic divergence between geographically isolated populations. By contrast, little is known about the characteristics of genes associated with reinforcement, the process by which natural selection directly favours restricted gene flow during the formation of species. Here we identify changes in two genes that appear to cause a flower colour change in Phlox drummondii, which previous work has shown contributes to reinforcement. Both changes involve cis-regulatory mutations to genes in the anthocyanin biosynthetic pathway (ABP). Because one change is recessive whereas the other is dominant, hybrid offspring produce an intermediate flower colour that is visited less by pollinators, and is presumably maladaptive. Thus genetic change selected to increase prezygotic isolation also appears to result in increased postzygotic isolation.","[Hopkins, Robin; Rausher, Mark D.] Duke Univ, Dept Biol, Durham, NC 27708 USA","Hopkins, R (reprint author), Duke Univ, Dept Biol, Box 90338, Durham, NC 27708 USA.",robin.hopkins@duke.edu; mrausher@duke.edu,,,National Science Foundation,"We thank D.

Lgr5 stem cells are interspersed between terminally differentiated Paneth cells that are known to produce bactericidal products such as lysozyme and cryptdins/defensins(3). Single Lgr5-expressing stem cells can be cultured to form long-lived, self-organizing crypt-villus organoids in the absence of non-epithelial niche cells(4). Here we find a close physical association of Lgr5 stem cells with Paneth cells in mice, both in vivo and in vitro. CD24(+) Paneth cells express EGF, TGF-alpha, Wnt3 and the Notch ligand Dll4, all essential signals for stem-cell maintenance in culture. Co-culturing of sorted stem cells with Paneth cells markedly improves organoid formation. This Paneth cell requirement can be substituted by a pulse of exogenous Wnt. Genetic removal of Paneth cells in vivo results in the concomitant loss of Lgr5 stem cells. In colon crypts, CD24(+) cells residing between Lgr5 stem cells may represent the Paneth cell equivalents. We conclude that Lgr5 stem cells compete for essential niche signals provided by a specialized daughter cell, the Paneth cell.","[Sato, Toshiro; van Es, Johan H.; Snippert, Hugo J.; Stange, Daniel E.; Vries, Robert G.; van den Born, Maaike; Barker, Nick; van de Wetering, Marc; Clevers, Hans] KNAW, Hubrecht Inst, NL-3584 CT Utrecht, Netherlands; [Sato, Toshiro; van Es, Johan H.; Snippert, Hugo J.; Stange, Daniel E.; Vries, Robert G.; van den Born, Maaike; Barker, Nick; van de Wetering, Marc; Clevers, Hans] Univ Med Ctr Utrecht, NL-3584 CT Utrecht, Netherlands; [Shroyer, Noah F.] Cincinnati Childrens Hosp, Div Gastroenterol, Med Ctr, MLC 2010, Cincinnati, OH 45229 USA","Clevers, H (reprint author), KNAW, Hubrecht Inst, Uppsalalaan 8, NL-3584 CT Utrecht, Netherlands.",h.clevers@hubrecht.eu,"Sato, Toshiro/J-3522-2014; Stange, Daniel/O-1837-2015","Stange, Daniel/0000-0003-4246-2230; Shroyer, Noah/0000-0002-5934-2852","NCI NIH HHS [R01 CA142826, R01 CA142826-01]; NIDDK NIH HHS [R03 DK084167, R03 DK084167-01]",,,29,803,821,24,144,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,20-Jan,2011,469,7330,,,,,415,+,,10.1038/nature09637,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,708SW,WOS:000286385600056,21113151,No,Y,N,11/20/17

In the gut, the fraction of strict anaerobes increases from proximal to distal, reaching 99% of bacterial species in the colon(3). At colonic mucosa, oxygen partial pressure is below 25% of airborne oxygen content, moreover microbial metabolism causes reduction to a low redox potential of -200 mV to -300 mV in the colon(4). Defensins, characterized by three intramolecular disulphide-bridges, are key effector molecules of innate immunity that protect the host from infectious microbes and shape the composition of microbiota at mucosal surfaces(5-8). Human beta-defensin 1 (hBD-1) is one of the most prominent peptides of its class but despite ubiquitous expression by all human epithelia, comparison with other defensins suggested only minor antibiotic killing activity(9,10). Whereas much is known about the activity of antimicrobial peptides in aerobic environments, data about reducing environments are limited. Herein we show that after reduction of disulphide-bridges hBD-1 becomes a potent antimicrobial peptide against the opportunistic pathogenic fungus Candida albicans and against anaerobic, Gram-positive commensals of Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus species. Reduced hBD-1 differs structurally from oxidized hBD-1 and free cysteines in the carboxy terminus seem important for the bactericidal effect. In vitro, the thioredoxin (TRX) system(11) is able to reduce hBD-1 and TRX co-localizes with reduced hBD-1 in human epithelia. Hence our study indicates that reduced hBD-1 shields the healthy epithelium against colonisation by commensal bacteria and opportunistic fungi. Accordingly, an intimate interplay between redox-regulation and innate immune defence seems crucial for an effective barrier protecting human epithelia.","[Schroeder, Bjoern O.; Nuding, Sabine; Beisner, Julia; Wehkamp, Jan] Dr Margarete Fischer Bosch Inst Clin Pharmacol, D-70376 Stuttgart, Germany; [Schroeder, Bjoern O.; Nuding, Sabine; Beisner, Julia; Wehkamp, Jan] Univ Tubingen, D-72076 Tubingen, Germany; [Wu, Zhihong] Univ Hosp Schleswig Holstein, Dept Dermatol, D-24105 Kiel, Germany; [Groscurth, Sandra] Max Planck Inst Dev Biol, Dept Prot Evolut 1, D-72076 Tubingen, Germany; [Marcinowski, Moritz; Buchner, Johannes] Tech Univ Munich, Dept Chem, Ctr Integrated Prot Sci Munich, D-85747 Garching, Germany; [Schaller, Martin] Univ Tubingen Hosp, Dept Dermatol, D-72076 Tubingen, Germany; [Stange, Eduard F.; Wehkamp, Jan] Robert Bosch Krankenhaus, Dept Internal Med 1, D-70376 Stuttgart, Germany","Wehkamp, J (reprint author), Dr Margarete Fischer Bosch Inst Clin Pharmacol, D-70376 Stuttgart, Germany.",jan.wehkamp@ikp-stuttgart.de,"Wehkamp, Jan/B-7319-2011; Schroeder, Bjoern/F-3353-2011; Wu, Zhihong/G-3569-2011; hongbo, yi /G-9615-2011; Buchner, Johannes/A-2651-2010","Schroeder, Bjoern/0000-0002-6716-8284; ","Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft [WE 436/1-1, SCH 897/1-3, SFB685]; Robert-Bosch Foundation (Stuttgart, Germany)","We thank M.

Retroviral CA proteins contain independently folded amino (N)- and carboxy (C)-terminal domains (NTD and CTD) that are connected by a flexible linker(2-4). The NTD forms either hexameric or pentameric rings, whereas the CTD forms symmetric homodimers that connect the rings into a hexagonal lattice(3,5-13). We previously used a disulphide crosslinking strategy to enable isolation and crystallization of soluble HIV-1 CA hexamers(11,14). Here we use the same approach to solve the X-ray structure of the HIV-1 CA pentamer at 2.5 angstrom resolution. Two mutant CA proteins with engineered disulphides at different positions (P17C/T19C and N21C/A22C) converged onto the same quaternary structure, indicating that the disulphide-crosslinked proteins recapitulate the structure of the native pentamer. Assembly of the quasi-equivalent hexamers and pentamers requires remarkably subtle rearrangements in subunit interactions, and appears to be controlled by an electrostatic switch that favours hexamers over pentamers. This study completes the gallery of substructures describing the components of the HIV-1 capsid and enables atomic-level modelling of the complete capsid. Rigid-body rotations around two assembly interfaces appear sufficient to generate the full range of continuously varying lattice curvature in the fullerene cone.","[Pornillos, Owen; Ganser-Pornillos, Barbie K.; Yeager, Mark] Univ Virginia, Sch Med, Dept Mol Physiol & Biol Phys, Charlottesville, VA 22908 USA; [Pornillos, Owen; Ganser-Pornillos, Barbie K.; Yeager, Mark] Scripps Res Inst, Dept Cell Biol, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; [Yeager, Mark] Univ Virginia Hlth Syst, Dept Med, Div Cardiovasc Med, Charlottesville, VA 22908 USA","Yeager, M (reprint author), Univ Virginia, Sch Med, Dept Mol Physiol & Biol Phys, Charlottesville, VA 22908 USA.",yeager@virginia.edu,,,"US National Institutes of Health [R01-GM066087, P50-GM082545]","This study was funded by grants from the US National Institutes of Health to M.Y.

There is good evidence that their principal targets are pentameric ligand-gated ion channels(1,2) (pLGICs) such as inhibitory GABA(A) (gamma-aminobutyric acid) receptors and excitatory nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, which are respectively potentiated and inhibited by general anaesthetics. The bacterial homologue from Gloeobacter violaceus(3) (GLIC), whose X-ray structure was recently solved(4,5), is also sensitive to clinical concentrations of general anaesthetics(6). Here we describe the crystal structures of the complexes propofol/GLIC and desflurane/GLIC. These reveal a common general-anaesthetic binding site, which pre-exists in the apo-structure in the upper part of the transmembrane domain of each protomer. Both molecules establish van der Waals interactions with the protein; propofol binds at the entrance of the cavity whereas the smaller, more flexible, desflurane binds deeper inside. Mutations of some amino acids lining the binding site profoundly alter the ionic response of GLIC to protons, and affect its general-anaesthetic pharmacology. Molecular dynamics simulations, performed on the wild type (WT) and two GLIC mutants, highlight differences in mobility of propofol in its binding site and help to explain these effects. These data provide a novel structural framework for the design of general anaesthetics and of allosteric modulators of brain pLGICs.","[Nury, Hugues; Van Renterghem, Catherine; Dufresne, Virginie; Corringer, Pierre-Jean] Inst Pasteur, Grp Recepteurs Canaux, F-75015 Paris, France; [Nury, Hugues; Van Renterghem, Catherine; Dufresne, Virginie; Changeux, Jean-Pierre; Corringer, Pierre-Jean] CNRS, URA2182, F-75015 Paris, France; [Nury, Hugues; Delarue, Marc] Inst Pasteur, Unite Dynam Struct Macromol, F-75015 Paris, France; [Nury, Hugues; Delarue, Marc] CNRS, URA2185, F-75015 Paris, France; [Weng, Yun; Tran, Alphonso; Sonner, James M.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Anesthesia & Perioperat Care, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; [Baaden, Marc] CNRS, UPR 9080, Inst Biol Physicochim, F-75005 Paris, France; [Changeux, Jean-Pierre] Coll France, F-75005 Paris, France","Corringer, PJ (reprint author), Inst Pasteur, Grp Recepteurs Canaux, F-75015 Paris, France.",delarue@pasteur.fr; pjcorrin@pasteur.fr,"Baaden, Marc/C-6623-2008","Baaden, Marc/0000-0001-6472-0486; Nury, Hugues/0000-0002-3433-256X","Commission of the European Communities; Louis D.

Recent crystal structures provide insights into inactive states of several GPCRs. Efforts to obtain an agonist-bound active-state GPCR structure have proven difficult due to the inherent instability of this state in the absence of a G protein. We generated a camelid antibody fragment (nanobody) to the human beta(2) adrenergic receptor (beta(2)AR) that exhibits G protein-like behaviour, and obtained an agonist-bound, active-state crystal structure of the receptor-nanobody complex. Comparison with the inactive beta(2)AR structure reveals subtle changes in the binding pocket; however, these small changes are associated with an 11 angstrom outward movement of the cytoplasmic end of transmembrane segment 6, and rearrangements of transmembrane segments 5 and 7 that are remarkably similar to those observed in opsin, an active form of rhodopsin.

Standard models(11) predict that a high incidence of gravitational lensing will probably distort measurements of flux and number of these earliest galaxies. The raw probability of this happening has been estimated to be similar to 0.5 per cent (refs 11, 12), but can be larger owing to observational biases. Here we report that gravitational lensing is likely to dominate the observed properties of galaxies with redshifts of z greater than or similar to 12, when the instrumental limiting magnitude is expected to be brighter than the characteristic magnitude of the galaxy sample. The number counts could be modified by an order of magnitude, with most galaxies being part of multiply imaged systems, located less than 1 arcsec from brighter foreground galaxies at z approximate to 2. This lens-induced association of high-redshift and foreground galaxies has perhaps already been observed among a sample of galaxy candidates identified at z approximate to 10.6.

When the ratio of electrons to magnetic flux quanta in the system (nu) is near 5/2, the electrons are predicted to condense into a correlated phase with fractionally charged quasiparticles and a ground-state degeneracy that grows exponentially as these quasiparticles are introduced(1). The only way for electrons to transform between the many ground states would be to braid the fractional excitations around each other. This property has been proposed as the basis of a fault-tolerant quantum computer(2). Here we present observations of localized quasiparticles at nu = 5/2, confined to puddles by disorder. Using a local electrometer to compare how quasiparticles at nu = 5/2 and nu = 7/3 charge these puddles, we were able to extract the ratio of local charges for these states. Averaged over several disorder configurations and samples, we found the ratio to be 4/3, suggesting that the local charges are e(7/3)* = e/3 and e(5/2)* = e/4, where e is the charge of an electron. This is in agreement with theoretical predictions for a paired state at nu = 5/2. Confirming the existence of localized e/4 quasiparticles shows that proposed interferometry experiments to test statistics and computational ability of the state at nu = 5/2 would be possible.","[Venkatachalam, Vivek; Yacoby, Amir] Harvard Univ, Dept Phys, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Pfeiffer, Loren; West, Ken] Princeton Univ, Dept Elect Engn, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA","Yacoby, A (reprint author), Harvard Univ, Dept Phys, 11 Oxford St, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",yacoby@physics.harvard.edu,,,Microsoft Corporation; National Science Foundation,"We would like to acknowledge B.

SrTiO3 is the preferred template for the creation of exotic, two-dimensional (2D) phases of electron matter at oxide interfaces(3-5) that have metal-insulator transitions(6,7), superconductivity(8,9) or large negative magnetoresistance(10). However, the physical nature of the electronic structure underlying these 2D electron gases (2DEGs), which is crucial to understanding their remarkable properties(11,12), remains elusive. Here we show, using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, that there is a highly metallic universal 2DEG at the vacuum-cleaved surface of SrTiO3 (including the non-doped insulating material) independently of bulk carrier densities over more than seven decades. This 2DEG is confined within a region of about five unit cells and has a sheet carrier density of similar to 0.33 electrons per square lattice parameter. The electronic structure consists of multiple subbands of heavy and light electrons. The similarity of this 2DEG to those reported in SrTiO3-based heterostructures(6,8,13) and field-effect transistors(9,14) suggests that different forms of electron confinement at the surface of SrTiO3 lead to essentially the same 2DEG. Our discovery provides a model system for the study of the electronic structure of 2DEGs in SrTiO3-based devices and a novel means of generating 2DEGs at the surfaces of transition-metal oxides.","[Santander-Syro, A.

They are able, for example, to guide the formation of smoothly curving single crystals or tough, lightweight, self-repairing skeletal elements(1). In many biominerals, an organic matrix interacts with the mineral as it forms, controls its morphology and polymorph, and is occluded during mineralization(2-4). The remarkable functional properties of the resulting composites-such as outstanding fracture toughness and wear resistance-can be attributed to buried organic-inorganic interfaces at multiple hierarchical levels(5). Analysing and controlling such interfaces at the nanometre length scale is critical also in emerging organic electronic and photovoltaic hybrid materials(6). However, elucidating the structural and chemical complexity of buried organic-inorganic interfaces presents a challenge to state-of-the-art imaging techniques. Here we show that pulsed-laser atom-probe tomography reveals three-dimensional chemical maps of organic fibres with a diameter of 5-10 nm in the surrounding nano-crystalline magnetite (Fe3O4) mineral in the tooth of a marine mollusc, the chiton Chaetopleura apiculata. Remarkably, most fibres co-localize with either sodium or magnesium. Furthermore, clustering of these cations in the fibre indicates a structural level of hierarchy previously undetected. Our results demonstrate that in the chiton tooth, individual organic fibres have different chemical compositions, and therefore probably different functional roles in controlling fibre formation and matrix-mineral interactions. Atom-probe tomography is able to detect this chemical/structural heterogeneity by virtue of its high three-dimensional spatial resolution and sensitivity across the periodic table. We anticipate that the quantitative analysis and visualization of nanometre-scale interfaces by laser-pulsed atom-probe tomography will contribute greatly to our understanding not only of biominerals (such as bone, dentine and enamel), but also of synthetic organic-inorganic composites.","[Gordon, Lyle M.; Joester, Derk] Northwestern Univ, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Evanston, IL 60208 USA","Joester, D (reprint author), Northwestern Univ, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, 2220 Campus Dr, Evanston, IL 60208 USA.",d-joester@northwestern.edu,"Joester, Derk/B-7525-2009","Gordon, Lyle/0000-0001-8335-0126","Canadian National Sciences and Engineering Research Council; US National Science Foundation [DMR-0805313]; NSF-NSEC; NSF-MRSEC; Keck Foundation; State of Illinois; Northwestern University; NSF-MRI [DMR-0420532]; ONR-DURIP [N00014-0400798, N00014-0610539, N00014-0910781]","This work was supported in part by the Canadian National Sciences and Engineering Research Council and the US National Science Foundation (DMR-0805313).

During this process, the spreading ridge and the volcanic arc separate and lavas erupted at the ridge are predicted to evolve away from being heavily subduction influenced (with high volatile contents derived from the subducting plate)(2-5). Current models(4,6-8) predict gradational, rather than abrupt, changes in the crust formed along the ridge as the inferred broad melting region beneath it migrates away from heavily subduction-influenced mantle. In contrast, here we show that across-strike and along-strike changes in crustal properties at the Eastern Lau spreading centre are large and abrupt, implying correspondingly large discontinuities in the nature of the mantle supplying melt to the ridge axes. With incremental separation of the ridge axis from the volcanic front of as little as 5 km, seafloor morphology changes from shallower complex volcanic landforms to deeper flat sea floor dominated by linear abyssal hills, upper crustal seismic velocities abruptly increase by over 20%, and gravity anomalies and isostasy indicate crustal thinning of more than 1.9 km. We infer that the abrupt changes in crustal properties reflect rapid evolution of the mantle entrained by the ridge, such that stable, broad triangular upwelling regions, as inferred for mid-ocean ridges(9,10), cannot form near the mantle wedge corner. Instead, the observations imply a dynamic process in which the ridge upwelling zone preferentially captures water-rich low-viscosity mantle when it is near the arc. As the ridge moves away from the arc, a tipping point is reached at which that material is rapidly released from the upwelling zone, resulting in rapid changes in the character of the crust formed at the ridge.","[Dunn, Robert A.] Univ Hawaii, Dept Geol & Geophys, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; [Martinez, Fernando] Univ Hawaii, Hawaii Inst Geophys & Planetol, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA","Dunn, RA (reprint author), Univ Hawaii, Dept Geol & Geophys, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA.",dunn@soest.hawaii.edu,"Dunn, Robert/L-9892-2014","Dunn, Robert/0000-0003-1434-5512","NSF [OCE0426428, OCE0732536, OCE0727138]","We thank the captain, crew, and science parties of the R/V Langseth leg MGL0903 and R/V Kilo Moana leg KM0804.

Because they lie in a high-latitude region, the Southern Ocean ecosystems are expected to be strongly affected by global warming. Using top predators of this highly productive ocean(2) (such as penguins) as integrative indicators may help us assess the impacts of climate change on marine ecosystems(3,4). Yet most available information on penguin population dynamics is based on the controversial use of flipper banding. Although some reports have found the effects of flipper bands to be deleterious(5-8), some short-term (one-year) studies have concluded otherwise(9-11), resulting in the continuation of extensive banding schemes and the use of data sets thus collected to predict climate impact on natural populations(12,13). Here we show that banding of free-ranging king penguins (Aptenodytes patagonicus) impairs both survival and reproduction, ultimately affecting population growth rate. Over the course of a 10-year longitudinal study, banded birds produced 39% fewer chicks and had a survival rate 16% lower than non-banded birds, demonstrating a massive long-term impact of banding and thus refuting the assumption that birds will ultimately adapt to being banded(6,12). Indeed, banded birds still arrived later for breeding at the study site and had longer foraging trips even after 10 years. One of our major findings is that responses of flipper-banded penguins to climate variability (that is, changes in sea surface temperature and in the Southern Oscillation index) differ from those of non-banded birds. We show that only long-term investigations may allow an evaluation of the impact of flipper bands and that every major life-history trait can be affected, calling into question the banding schemes still going on. In addition, our understanding of the effects of climate change on marine ecosystems based on flipper-band data should be reconsidered.","[Saraux, Claire; Le Bohec, Celine; Viblanc, Vincent A.; Beaune, David; Le Maho, Yvon] Univ Strasbourg, Inst Pluridisciplinaire Hubert Curien, F-67087 Strasbourg, France; [Saraux, Claire; Le Bohec, Celine; Viblanc, Vincent A.; Beaune, David; Le Maho, Yvon] CNRS, UMR7178, F-67037 Strasbourg, France; [Saraux, Claire; Le Bohec, Celine; Durant, Joel M.; Stenseth, Nils C.] Univ Oslo, Dept Biol, Ctr Ecol & Evolutionary Synth, N-0316 Oslo, Norway; [Saraux, Claire] ENGREF, AgroParisTech, F-75732 Paris, France; [Gauthier-Clerc, Michel] Ctr Rech Tour Valat, F-13200 Arles, France; [Park, Young-Hyang] Museum Natl Hist Nat, USM LOCEAN 0402, Dept Milieux & Peuplements Aquat, F-75231 Paris, France; [Yoccoz, Nigel G.] Univ Tromso, Dept Arctic & Marine Biol, N-9037 Tromso, Norway; [Stenseth, Nils C.] Inst Marine Res, Flodevigen Marine Res Stn, N-4817 His, Norway","Saraux, C (reprint author), Univ Strasbourg, Inst Pluridisciplinaire Hubert Curien, 23 Rue Becquerel, F-67087 Strasbourg, France.",claire.saraux@c-strasbourg.fr; yvon.lemaho@iphc.cnrs.fr,"; Durant, Joel/D-3821-2013; Viblanc, Vincent/A-7455-2014; Yoccoz, Nigel/C-8561-2014; Stenseth, Nils Chr./G-5212-2016","Beaune, David/0000-0002-2329-1598; Durant, Joel/0000-0002-1129-525X; Viblanc, Vincent/0000-0002-4953-659X; Yoccoz, Nigel/0000-0003-2192-1039; Stenseth, Nils Chr./0000-0002-1591-5399; Saraux, Claire/0000-0001-5061-4009",Institut Polaire Francais-Paul-Emile Victor; Fondation Bettencourt-Schueller; Fondation des Treilles; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique; European Commission; Norwegian Research Council; YGGDRASIL programme,"We thank P.

Such efforts, inspired in the standard design of electronic circuits(4-7), are limited by the difficulties arising from wiring the basic computational units (logic gates) through the appropriate connections, each one to be implemented by a different molecule. Here, we show that there is a logically different form of implementing complex Boolean logic computations that reduces wiring constraints thanks to a redundant distribution of the desired output among engineered cells. A practical implementation is presented using a library of engineered yeast cells, which can be combined in multiple ways. Each construct defines a logic function and combining cells and their connections allow building more complex synthetic devices. As a proof of principle, we have implemented many logic functions by using just a few engineered cells. Of note, small modifications and combination of those cells allowed for implementing more complex circuits such as a multiplexer or a 1-bit adder with carry, showing the great potential for re-utilization of small parts of the circuit. Our results support the approach of using cellular consortia as an efficient way of engineering complex tasks not easily solvable using single-cell implementations.","[Macia, Javier; Conde, Nuria; Sole, Ricard] UPF, ICREA Complex Syst Lab, E-08003 Barcelona, Spain; [Regot, Sergi; Conde, Nuria; Peeters, Tom; de Nadal, Eulalia; Posas, Francesc] UPF, Dept Ciencies Expt & Salut, Cell Signaling Unit, E-08003 Barcelona, Spain; [Furukawa, Kentaro; Kjellen, Jimmy; Hohmann, Stefan] Univ Gothenburg, Dept Cell & Mol Biol Microbiol, S-40530 Gothenburg, Sweden; [Sole, Ricard] Santa Fe Inst, Santa Fe, NM 87501 USA; [Sole, Ricard] UPF, CSIC, Inst Biol Evolut, E-08003 Barcelona, Spain","Sole, R (reprint author), UPF, ICREA Complex Syst Lab, E-08003 Barcelona, Spain.",francesc.posas@upf.edu; ricard.sole@upf.edu,"de Nadal, Eulalia/J-8178-2014; Hohmann, Stefan/K-9895-2013; Sole, Ricard/I-3379-2015; Posas, Francesc/K-1364-2013","de Nadal, Eulalia/0000-0003-0039-5607; Hohmann, Stefan/0000-0002-0809-1985; Posas, Francesc/0000-0002-4164-7076; Regot, Sergi/0000-0001-9786-3897","FPU (Spanish Government); James McDonnell Foundation; MICINN [BIO2009-07762, FIS2009-12365]; Consolider Ingenio 2010 programme [CSD2007-0015]; ESF [ERAS-CT-2003-980409]; CELLCOMPUT (FP6) project; FP7 UNICELLSYS [201142]; Santa Fe Institute; Fundacion Marcelino Botin (FMB); ICREA Academia (Generalitat de Catalunya); ICREA","We thank L.

Here we study this process by combining a simple genetic circuit with quorum sensing to produce more complex computations in space. We construct a simple NOR logic gate in Escherichia coli by arranging two tandem promoters that function as inputs to drive the transcription of a repressor. The repressor inactivates a promoter that serves as the output. Individual colonies of E. coli carry the same NOR gate, but the inputs and outputs are wired to different orthogonal quorum-sensing 'sender' and 'receiver' devices(4,5). The quorum molecules form the wires between gates. By arranging the colonies in different spatial configurations, all possible two-input gates are produced, including the difficult XOR and EQUALS functions. The response is strong and robust, with 5- to >300-fold changes between the 'on' and 'off' states. This work helps elucidate the design rules by which simple logic can be harnessed to produce diverse and complex calculations by rewiring communication between cells.","[Tabor, Jeffrey J.; Voigt, Christopher A.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Sch Pharm, Dept Pharmaceut Chem, San Francisco, CA 94158 USA; [Tamsir, Alvin] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Biochem & Biophys, San Francisco, CA 94158 USA","Voigt, CA (reprint author), Univ Calif San Francisco, Sch Pharm, Dept Pharmaceut Chem, San Francisco, CA 94158 USA.",cavoigt@picasso.ucsf.edu,"Tabor, Jeffrey/A-7022-2008","Tabor, Jeffrey/0000-0001-7316-0361","National Science Foundation (NSF) [0943385, CCF-0943385]; Office of Naval Research","We thank W.

To identify genetic risk factors for neuroblastoma, we performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) on 2,251 patients and 6,097 control subjects of European ancestry from four case series. Here we report a significant association within LIM domain only 1 (LMO1) at 11p15.4 (rs110419, combined P = 5.2 x 10(-16), odds ratio of risk allele = 1.34 (95% confidence interval 1.25-1.44)). The signal was enriched in the subset of patients with the most aggressive form of the disease. LMO1 encodes a cysteine-rich transcriptional regulator, and its paralogues (LMO2, LMO3 and LMO4) have each been previously implicated in cancer. In parallel, we analysed genome-wide DNA copy number alterations in 701 primary tumours. We found that the LMO1 locus was aberrant in 12.4% through a duplication event, and that this event was associated with more advanced disease (P < 0.0001) and survival (P = 0.041). The germline single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) risk alleles and somatic copy number gains were associated with increased LMO1 expression in neuroblastoma cell lines and primary tumours, consistent with a gain-of-function role in tumorigenesis. Short hairpin RNA (shRNA)-mediated depletion of LMO1 inhibited growth of neuroblastoma cells with high LMO1 expression, whereas forced expression of LMO1 in neuroblastoma cells with low LMO1 expression enhanced proliferation. These data show that common polymorphisms at the LMO1 locus are strongly associated with susceptibility to developing neuroblastoma, but also may influence the likelihood of further somatic alterations at this locus, leading to malignant progression.","[Wang, Kai; Zhang, Haitao; Hou, Cuiping; Glessner, Joseph; Kim, Cecilia; Frackelton, Edward; Glaberson, Wendy; Chiavacci, Rosetta; Grant, Struan F.

Previous studies suggested that NLRP3 inflammasome activity is negatively regulated by autophagy and positively regulated by reactive oxygen species (ROS) derived from an uncharacterized organelle. Here we show that mitophagy/autophagy blockade leads to the accumulation of damaged, ROS-generating mitochondria, and this in turn activates the NLRP3 inflammasome. Resting NLRP3 localizes to endoplasmic reticulum structures, whereas on inflammasome activation both NLRP3 and its adaptor ASC redistribute to the perinuclear space where they co-localize with endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria organelle clusters. Notably, both ROS generation and inflammasome activation are suppressed when mitochondrial activity is dysregulated by inhibition of the voltage-dependent anion channel. This indicates that NLRP3 inflammasome senses mitochondrial dysfunction and may explain the frequent association of mitochondrial damage with inflammatory diseases.","[Zhou, Rongbin; Yazdi, Amir S.; Menu, Philippe; Tschopp, Juerg] Univ Lausanne, Ctr Immun & Infect, Dept Biochem, CH-1066 Epalinges, Switzerland","Tschopp, J (reprint author), Univ Lausanne, Ctr Immun & Infect, Dept Biochem, Chemin Boveresses 155, CH-1066 Epalinges, Switzerland.",jurg.tschopp@unil.ch,"Zhou, Rongbin/B-1430-2013",,Swiss National Science Foundation; Institute for Arthritis Research; DFG,"This study was supported by grants of the Swiss National Science Foundation and by the Institute for Arthritis Research.

Mitotic cell rounding is thought to facilitate organization within the mitotic cell and be necessary for the geometric requirements of division(4-7). However, the forces that drive this shape change remain poorly understood in the presence of external impediments, such as a tissue environment(2). Here we use cantilevers to track cell rounding force and volume. We show that cells have an outward rounding force, which increases as cells enter mitosis. We find that this mitotic rounding force depends both on the actomyosin cytoskeleton and the cells' ability to regulate osmolarity. The rounding force itself is generated by an osmotic pressure. However, the actomyosin cortex is required to maintain this rounding force against external impediments. Instantaneous disruption of the actomyosin cortex leads to volume increase, and stimulation of actomyosin contraction leads to volume decrease. These results show that in cells, osmotic pressure is balanced by inwardly directed actomyosin cortex contraction. Thus, by locally modulating actomyosin-cortex-dependent surface tension and globally regulating osmotic pressure, cells can control their volume, shape and mechanical properties.","[Toyoda, Yusuke; Hyman, Anthony A.] Max Planck Inst Mol Cell Biol & Genet, D-1307 Dresden, Germany; [Stewart, Martin P.; Helenius, Jonne; Ramanathan, Subramanian P.; Muller, Daniel J.] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Dept Biosyst Sci & Engn, CH-4058 Basel, Switzerland; [Stewart, Martin P.] Tech Univ Dresden, Ctr Biotechnol, D-01307 Dresden, Germany","Hyman, AA (reprint author), Max Planck Inst Mol Cell Biol & Genet, D-1307 Dresden, Germany.",daniel.muller@bsse.ethz.ch,"Muller, Daniel/A-5967-2010; Hyman, Anthony/B-3917-2017","Muller, Daniel/0000-0003-3075-0665; Hyman, Anthony/0000-0003-3664-154X; Stewart, Martin Philip/0000-0003-4112-6622; Toyoda, Yusuke/0000-0003-0534-6898",DFG; BMBF; SNF; JSPS; Max Planck Society,"DFG, BMBF and SNF supported this project.

The proto-oncoprotein c-Jun belongs to the AP-1 group of transcription factors and it is a crucial regulator of intestinal progenitor proliferation and tumorigenesis(2-4). An important mechanism of AP-1 stimulation is phosphorylation of c-Jun by the Jun amino-terminal kinases (JNKs)(1). N-terminal phosphorylation of the c-Jun transactivation domain increases target gene transcription(5,6), but a molecular explanation was elusive. Here we show that unphosphorylated, but not N-terminally phosphorylated c-Jun, interacts with Mbd3 and thereby recruits the nucleosome remodelling and histone deacetylation (NuRD) repressor complex. Mbd3 depletion in colon cancer cells increased histone acetylation at AP-1-dependent promoters, which resulted in increased target gene expression. The intestinal stem cell marker lgr5 was identified as a novel target gene controlled by c-Jun/Mbd3. Gut-specific conditional deletion of mbd3 (mbd3(Delta G/Delta G) mice) stimulated c-Jun activity and increased progenitor cell proliferation. In response to inflammation, mdb3 deficiency resulted in colonic hyperproliferation and mbd3(Delta G/Delta G) mice showed markedly increased susceptibility to colitis-induced tumorigenesis. Notably, concomitant inactivation of a single allele of c-jun reverted physiological and pathological hyperproliferation, as well as the increased tumorigenesis in mbd3(Delta G/Delta G) mice. Thus the transactivation domain of c-Jun recruits Mbd3/NuRD to AP-1 target genes to mediate gene repression, and this repression is relieved by JNK-mediated c-Jun N-terminal phosphorylation.","[Aguilera, Cristina; Nakagawa, Kentaro; Sancho, Rocio; Chakraborty, Atanu; Behrens, Axel] Canc Res UK London Res Inst, Mammalian Genet Lab, Lincolns Inn Fields Labs, London WC2A 3PX, England; [Nakagawa, Kentaro] Tokyo Med & Dent Univ, Grad Sch Med, Dept Med Biochem, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo 1138519, Japan; [Hendrich, Brian] Univ Cambridge, Dept Biochem, MRC,Wellcome Trust Ctr Stem Cell Res, Ctr Stem Cell Biol & Regenerat Med, Cambridge CB2 1QR, England","Behrens, A (reprint author), Canc Res UK London Res Inst, Mammalian Genet Lab, Lincolns Inn Fields Labs, 44 Lincolns Inn Fields, London WC2A 3PX, England.",axel.behrens@cancer.org.uk,,"Hendrich, Brian/0000-0002-0231-3073","Marie Curie Intraeuropean Fellowships [PIEF-GA-2008-220566, MEIF-CT-2006-041119]; Cancer Research UK","We are grateful to the LRI Animal Unit, Equipment Park, FACS, Peptide synthesis and the Experimental Histopathology unit for technical help and O.

Despite recent progress in the structural biology of GPCRs(1), the molecular basis for agonist binding and allosteric modulation of these proteins is poorly understood. Structural knowledge of agonist-bound states is essential for deciphering the mechanism of receptor activation, and for structure-guided design and optimization of ligands. However, the crystallization of agonist-bound GPCRs has been hampered by modest affinities and rapid off-rates of available agonists. Using the inactive structure of the human beta(2) adrenergic receptor (beta(2)AR) as a guide, we designed a beta(2)AR agonist that can be covalently tethered to a specific site on the receptor through a disulphide bond. The covalent beta(2)AR-agonist complex forms efficiently, and is capable of activating a heterotrimeric G protein. We crystallized a covalent agonist-bound beta(2)AR-T4L fusion protein in lipid bilayers through the use of the lipidic mesophase method(2), and determined its structure at 3.5 angstrom resolution. A comparison to the inactive structure and an antibody-stabilized active structure (companion paper(3)) shows how binding events at both the extracellular and intracellular surfaces are required to stabilize an active conformation of the receptor. The structures are in agreement with long-timescale (up to 30 mu s) molecular dynamics simulations showing that an agonist-bound active conformation spontaneously relaxes to an inactive-like conformation in the absence of a G protein or stabilizing antibody.","[Rosenbaum, Daniel M.; Zhang, Cheng; Rasmussen, Soren G.

Synthetic ligands have been developed that either activate or inhibit beta ARs for the treatment of asthma, hypertension or cardiac dysfunction. These ligands are classified as either full agonists, partial agonists or antagonists, depending on whether the cellular response is similar to that of the native ligand, reduced or inhibited, respectively. However, the structural basis for these different ligand efficacies is unknown. Here we present four crystal structures of the thermo-stabilized turkey (Meleagris gallopavo) beta(1)-adrenergic receptor (beta(1)AR-m23) bound to the full agonists carmoterol and isoprenaline and the partial agonists salbutamol and dobutamine. In each case, agonist binding induces a 1 angstrom contraction of the catecholamine-binding pocket relative to the antagonist bound receptor. Full agonists can form hydrogen bonds with two conserved serine residues in transmembrane helix 5 (Ser(5.42) and Ser(5.46)), but partial agonists only interact with Ser(5.42) (superscripts refer to Ballesteros-Weinstein numbering(3)).

DNA cleavage by RAG occurs only at the G1 phase of the cell cycle and generates two hairpin-sealed DNA (coding) ends that require nucleolytic opening before their repair by classical non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ)(1-3). Although there are several cellular nucleases that could perform this function, only the Artemis nuclease is able to do so efficiently(2,3). Here, in vivo, we show that in murine cells the histone protein H2AX prevents nucleases other than Artemis from processing hairpin-sealed coding ends; in the absence of H2AX, CtIP can efficiently promote the hairpin opening and resection of DNA ends generated by RAG cleavage. This CtIP-mediated resection is inhibited by gamma-H2AX and by MDC-1 (mediator of DNA damage checkpoint 1), which binds to gamma-H2AX in chromatin flanking DNA DSBs. Moreover, the ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) kinase activates antagonistic pathways that modulate this resection. CtIP DNA end resection activity is normally limited to cells at post-replicative stages of the cell cycle, in which it is essential for homology-mediated repair(4,5). In G1-phase lymphocytes, DNA ends that are processed by CtIP are not efficiently joined by classical NHEJ and the joints that do form frequently use micro-homologies and show significant chromosomal deletions. Thus, H2AX preserves the structural integrity of broken DNA ends in G1-phase lymphocytes, thereby preventing these DNA ends from accessing repair pathways that promote genomic instability.","[Helmink, Beth A.; Tubbs, Anthony T.; Dorsett, Yair; Bednarski, Jeffrey J.; Walker, Laura M.; Sleckman, Barry P.] Washington Univ, Sch Med, Dept Pathol & Immunol, St Louis, MO 63110 USA; [Bednarski, Jeffrey J.] Washington Univ, Sch Med, Dept Pediat, St Louis, MO 63110 USA; [Feng, Zhihui; Sharma, Girdhar G.; Zhang, Junran] Washington Univ, Sch Med, Dept Radiat Oncol, St Louis, MO 63110 USA; [McKinnon, Peter J.] St Jude Childrens Hosp, Dept Genet & Tumor Cell Biol, Memphis, TN 38105 USA; [Bassing, Craig H.] Univ Penn, Sch Med,Ctr Childhood Canc Res, Childrens Hosp Philadelphia,Dept Pathol & Lab Med, Abramson Family Canc Res Inst,Div Canc Pathobiol, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA","Sleckman, BP (reprint author), Washington Univ, Sch Med, Dept Pathol & Immunol, St Louis, MO 63110 USA.",sleckman@wustl.edu,,"Tubbs, Anthony/0000-0002-5605-8231","National Institutes of Health (NIH) [AI074953, AI47829, CA136470, CA125195, CA21765, NS37956, T32 HD007499]; Children's Discovery Institute","We thank E.

Deficiencies for classical NHEJ factors, such as XRCC4, abrogate lymphocyte development, owing to a strict requirement for classical NHEJ to join V(D) J recombination DSB intermediates(1,2). The XRCC4-like factor (XLF; also called NHEJ1) is mutated in certain immunodeficient human patients and has been implicated in classical NHEJ(3-6); however, XLF-deficient mice have relatively normal lymphocyte development and their lymphocytes support normal V(D) J recombination(5). The ataxia telangiectasia-mutated protein (ATM) detects DSBs and activates DSB responses by phosphorylating substrates including histone H2AX(7). However, ATM deficiency causes only modest V(D) J recombination and lymphocyte developmental defects, and H2AX deficiency does not have a measurable impact on these processes(7-9). Here we show that XLF, ATM and H2AX all have fundamental roles in processing and joining DNA ends during V(D) J recombination, but that these roles have been masked by unanticipated functional redundancies. Thus, combined deficiency of ATM and XLF nearly blocks mouse lymphocyte development due to an inability to process and join chromosomal V(D) J recombination DSB intermediates. Combined XLF and ATM deficiency also severely impairs classical NHEJ, but not alternative end-joining, during IgH class switch recombination. Redundant ATM and XLF functions in classical NHEJ are mediated by ATM kinase activity and are not required for extra-chromosomal V(D) J recombination, indicating a role for chromatin-associated ATM substrates. Correspondingly, conditional H2AX inactivation in XLF-deficient pro-B lines leads to V(D) J recombination defects associated with marked degradation of unjoined V(D) J ends, revealing that H2AX has a role in this process.","[Zha, Shan; Guo, Chunguang; Boboila, Cristian; Oksenych, Valentyn; Cheng, Hwei-Ling; Zhang, Yu; Wesemann, Duane R.; Yuen, Grace; Patel, Harin; Goff, Peter H.; Alt, Frederick W.] Childrens Hosp, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Immune Dis Inst, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Zha, Shan; Guo, Chunguang; Boboila, Cristian; Oksenych, Valentyn; Cheng, Hwei-Ling; Zhang, Yu; Wesemann, Duane R.; Yuen, Grace; Patel, Harin; Goff, Peter H.; Alt, Frederick W.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Dubois, Richard L.] Columbia Univ, Inst Canc Genet, Dept Pediat, Dept Pathol & Cell Biol, New York, NY 10032 USA","Alt, FW (reprint author), Childrens Hosp, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Immune Dis Inst, Boston, MA 02115 USA.",alt@enders.tch.harvard.edu,,"Oksenych, Valentyn/0000-0002-5088-3791","NIH [AI076210, AI020047, AI007376]; Cancer Research Institute; AAAI/GlaxoSmithKline","We thank Y.

Here we show that amyloid-beta oligomers bind to the fibronectin repeats domain of EphB2 and trigger EphB2 degradation in the proteasome. To determine the pathogenic importance of EphB2 depletions in Alzheimer's disease and related models, we used lentiviral constructs to reduce or increase neuronal expression of EphB2 in memory centres of the mouse brain. In nontransgenic mice, knockdown of EphB2 mediated by short hairpin RNA reduced NMDA receptor currents and impaired long-term potentiation in the dentate gyrus, which are important for memory formation. Increasing EphB2 expression in the dentate gyrus of human amyloid precursor protein transgenic mice reversed deficits in NMDA receptor-dependent long-term potentiation and memory impairments. Thus, depletion of EphB2 is critical in amyloid-beta-induced neuronal dysfunction. Increasing EphB2 levels or function could be beneficial in Alzheimer's disease.","[Cisse, Moustapha; Halabisky, Brian; Harris, Julie; Devidze, Nino; Dubal, Dena B.; Sun, Binggui; Orr, Anna; Lotz, Gregor; Kim, Daniel H.; Hamto, Patricia; Ho, Kaitlyn; Yu, Gui-Qiu; Mucke, Lennart] Gladstone Inst Neurol Dis, San Francisco, CA 94158 USA; [Cisse, Moustapha; Halabisky, Brian; Harris, Julie; Dubal, Dena B.; Sun, Binggui; Orr, Anna; Lotz, Gregor; Mucke, Lennart] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Neurol, San Francisco, CA 94158 USA","Mucke, L (reprint author), Gladstone Inst Neurol Dis, San Francisco, CA 94158 USA.",lmucke@gladstone.ucsf.edu,"Sun, Binggui/J-9028-2016","Sun, Binggui/0000-0002-0386-6569","NIH [AG011385, AG022074, NS041787]; McBean Family Foundation; National Center for Research Resources [RR18928-01]","We thank I.

During Pavlovian learning, previously neutral stimuli that predict rewards can acquire motivational properties, becoming attractive and desirable incentive stimuli. However, whether a cue acts solely as a predictor of reward, or also serves as an incentive stimulus, differs between individuals. Thus, individuals vary in the degree to which cues bias choice and potentially promote maladaptive behaviour. Here we use rats that differ in the incentive motivational properties they attribute to food cues to probe the role of the neurotransmitter dopamine in stimulus-reward learning. We show that intact dopamine transmission is not required for all forms of learning in which reward cues become effective predictors. Rather, dopamine acts selectively in a form of stimulus-reward learning in which incentive salience is assigned to reward cues. In individuals with a propensity for this form of learning, reward cues come to powerfully motivate and control behaviour. This work provides insight into the neurobiology of a form of stimulus-reward learning that confers increased susceptibility to disorders of impulse control.","[Clark, Jeremy J.; Willuhn, Ingo; Akers, Christina A.; Phillips, Paul E.

It is the most widespread terrestrial plant symbiosis, improving plant uptake of water and mineral nutrients.

Recent evidence suggests that AM fungi produce diffusible symbiotic signals. Here we show that Glomus intraradices secretes symbiotic signals that are a mixture of sulphated and non-sulphated simple lipochitooligosaccharides (LCOs), which stimulate formation of AM in plant species of diverse families (Fabaceae, Asteraceae and Umbelliferae). In the legume Medicago truncatula these signals stimulate root growth and branching by the symbiotic DMI signalling pathway. These findings provide a better understanding of the evolution of signalling mechanisms involved in plant root endosymbioses and will greatly facilitate their molecular dissection.

The solar C/O is 0.54 (ref. 3). Here we report an analysis of dayside multi-wavelength photometry(4,5) of the transiting hot Jupiter WASP-12b (ref. 6) that reveals C/O >= 1 in its atmosphere. The atmosphere is abundant in CO. It is depleted in water vapour and enhanced in methane, each by more than two orders of magnitude compared to a solar-abundance chemical-equilibrium model at the expected temperatures. We also find that the extremely irradiated atmosphere (T > 2,500 K) of WASP-12b lacks a prominent thermal inversion (or stratosphere) and has very efficient day-night energy circulation.

However, knowledge of nuclear forces and the mechanisms governing the structure of nuclei, in particular far from stability, is still incomplete. In nuclei with equal neutron and proton numbers (N = Z), enhanced correlations arise between neutrons and protons (two distinct types of fermions) that occupy orbitals with the same quantum numbers. Such correlations have been predicted to favour an unusual type of nuclear superfluidity, termed isoscalar neutron-proton pairing(2-6), in addition to normal isovector pairing. Despite many experimental efforts, these predictions have not been confirmed. Here we report the experimental observation of excited states in the N = Z = 46 nucleus Pd-92. Gamma rays emitted following the Ni-58(Ar-36,2n)Pd-92 fusion-evaporation reaction were identified using a combination of state-of-the-art high-resolution c-ray, charged-particle and neutron detector systems. Our results reveal evidence for a spin-aligned, isoscalar neutron-proton coupling scheme, different from the previous prediction(2-6). We suggest that this coupling scheme replaces normal superfluidity (characterized by seniority coupling(7,8)) in the ground and low-lying excited states of the heaviest N = Z nuclei. Such strong, isoscalar neutron-proton correlations would have a considerable impact on the nuclear level structure and possibly influence the dynamics of rapid proton capture in stellar nucleosynthesis.","[Cederwall, B.; Moradi, F.

Nature uses sophisticated templates such as the ribosome, whereas chemists use simple ions or small molecules. But as we tackle the synthesis of larger targets, we require larger templates-which themselves become synthetically challenging. Here we show that Vernier complexes can solve this problem: if the number of binding sites on the template, n(T), is not a multiple of the number of binding sites on the molecular building blocks, n(B), then small templates can direct the assembly of relatively large Vernier complexes where the number of binding sites in the product, n(P), is the lowest common multiple of n(B) and n(T) (refs 8, 9). We illustrate the value of this concept for the covalent synthesis of challenging targets by using a simple six-site template to direct the synthesis of a 12-porphyrin nano-ring with a diameter of 4.7 nm, thus establishing Vernier templating as a powerful new strategy for the synthesis of large monodisperse macromolecules.","[O'Sullivan, Melanie C.; Sprafke, Johannes K.; Kondratuk, Dmitry V.; Rinfray, Corentin; Claridge, Timothy D.

This stereoelectronic effect influences the three-dimensional shapes of many biological molecules. It can be manifested not only in this classical manner involving interaction of the endocyclic oxygen atom (O5) found in such sugars with the C1 substituent (endo-anomeric effect) but also through a corresponding interaction of the electronegative exocyclic substituent with O5 (exoanomeric effect). However, the underlying physical origin(s) of this phenomenon is still not clear(1,3,4,11-14). Here we show, using a combination of laser spectroscopy and computational analysis, that a truncated peptide motif can engage the two anomers of an isolated sugar in the gas phase, an environment lacking extraneous factors which could confound the analysis. (Anomers are isomers that differ in the orientation of the substituent at C1.) Complexes formed between the peptide and the alpha- or beta-anomers of D-galactose are nearly identical structurally; however, the strength of the polarization of their interactions with the peptide differs greatly. Natural bond order calculations support this observation, and together they reveal the dominance of the exo- over the endo-anomeric effect. As interactions between oxygen atoms at positions C1 and C2 (O1 and O2, respectively) on the pyranose ring can alter the exo/endo ratio of a carbohydrate, our results suggest that it will be important to reevaluate the influence, and biological effects, of substituents at position C2 in sugars.","[Davis, Benjamin G.] Univ Oxford, Dept Chem, Chem Res Lab, Oxford OX1 3TA, England; [Cocinero, Emilio J.; Carcabal, Pierre; Vaden, Timothy D.; Simons, John P.] Univ Oxford, Dept Chem, Phys & Theoret Chem Lab, Oxford OX1 3QZ, England","Davis, BG (reprint author), Univ Oxford, Dept Chem, Chem Res Lab, Mansfield Rd, Oxford OX1 3TA, England.",John.Simons@chem.ox.ac.uk; Ben.Davis@chem.ox.ac.uk,"; Davis, Benjamin/C-5281-2011; Cocinero, Emilio/C-6497-2009","Vaden, Timothy/0000-0002-2648-0300; Davis, Benjamin/0000-0002-5056-407X; Cocinero, Emilio/0000-0001-7632-3728",EPSRC [GR/T26542]; Leverhulme Trust; Spanish Ministry (MCINN) for a Juan de la Cierva; Royal Society for a USA/Canada; Linacre College; Royal Society,"We thank the EPSRC for funding (GR/T26542), the Leverhulme Trust for the award of an Emeritus Fellowship (J.P.S.), the Spanish Ministry (MCINN) for a Juan de la Cierva contract (E.J.C.), the Royal Society for a USA/Canada Research Fellowship and Linacre College for a Junior Research Fellowship (T.D.V.), the STFC for the provision of equipment from the Laser Loan Pool, and the Oxford Supercomputing Centre for their services.

In recent biogeochemical studies it has been hypothesized that oxygen deficiency was widespread in subsurface water masses of later Cambrian oceans(1,2), possibly influencing evolutionary events during this time(1-3). Physical evidence of widespread anoxia in Cambrian oceans has remained elusive and thus its potential relationship to the palaeontological record remains largely unexplored. Here we present sulphur isotope records from six globally distributed stratigraphic sections of later Cambrian marine rocks (about 499 million years old). We find a positive sulphur isotope excursion in phase with the Steptoean Positive Carbon Isotope Excursion (SPICE), a large and rapid excursion in the marine carbon isotope record, which is thought to be indicative of a global carbon cycle perturbation(4,5). Numerical box modelling of the paired carbon sulphur isotope data indicates that these isotope shifts reflect transient increases in the burial of organic carbon and pyrite sulphur in sediments deposited under large-scale anoxic and sulphidic (euxinic) conditions. Independently, molybdenum abundances in a coeval black shale point convincingly to the transient spread of anoxia. These results identify the SPICE interval as the best characterized ocean anoxic event in the pre-Mesozoic ocean and an extreme example of oxygen deficiency in the later Cambrian ocean. Thus, a redox structure similar to those in Proterozoic oceans(6-8) may have persisted or returned in the oceans of the early Phanerozoic eon. Indeed, the environmental challenges presented by widespread anoxia may have been a prevalent if not dominant influence on animal evolution in Cambrian oceans.","[Gill, Benjamin C.; Lyons, Timothy W.] Univ Calif Riverside, Dept Earth Sci, Riverside, CA 92521 USA; [Young, Seth A.] Indiana Univ, Dept Geol Sci, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA; [Kump, Lee R.] Penn State Univ, Dept Geosci, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Knoll, Andrew H.] Harvard Univ, Dept Organism & Evolutionary Biol, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Saltzman, Matthew R.] Ohio State Univ, Sch Earth Sci, Columbus, OH 43210 USA","Gill, BC (reprint author), Harvard Univ, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, 20 Oxford St, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",bgill@fas.harvard.edu,"Saltzman, Matthew/B-6769-2011; Kump, Lee/H-8287-2012; Gill, Benjamin/B-8047-2012","Saltzman, Matthew/0000-0001-8052-1399; Gill, Benjamin/0000-0001-7402-0811",NSF-EAR; NASA Astrobiology,"NSF-EAR and NASA Astrobiology provided funding.

Nevertheless, a recent theoretical model suggests that positive interactions (for example, mutualisms) may counterbalance competition, facilitating long-term coexistence even among ecologically undifferentiated species(2). Mullerian mimics are mutualists that share the costs of predator education(3) and are therefore ideally suited for the investigation of positive and negative interactions in community dynamics. The sole empirical test of this model in a Mullerian mimetic community supports the prediction that positive interactions outweigh the negative effects of spatial overlap(4) (without quantifying resource acquisition). Understanding the role of trophic niche partitioning in facilitating the evolution and stability of Mullerian mimetic communities is now of critical importance, but has yet to be formally investigated. Here we show that resource partitioning and phylogeny determine community structure and outweigh the positive effects of Mullerian mimicry in a species-rich group of neotropical catfishes. From multiple, independent reproductively isolated allopatric communities displaying convergently evolved colour patterns, 92% consist of species that do not compete for resources. Significant differences in phylogenetically conserved traits (snout morphology and body size) were consistently linked to trait-specific resource acquisition. Thus, we report the first evidence, to our knowledge, that competition for trophic resources and phylogeny are pivotal factors in the stable evolution of Mullerian mimicry rings. More generally, our work demonstrates that competition for resources is likely to have a dominant role in the structuring of communities that are simultaneously subject to the effects of both positive and negative interactions.","[Alexandrou, Markos A.; Maillard, Marjorie; Creer, Simon; Taylor, Martin I.] Bangor Univ, Coll Nat Sci, Sch Biol Sci, Mol Ecol & Fisheries Genet Lab,Environm Ctr Wales, Bangor LL57 2UW, Gwynedd, Wales; [Oliveira, Claudio] Univ Estadual Paulista, Inst Biociencias, Dept Morfol, BR-18618970 Botucatu, SP, Brazil; [McGill, Rona A.

It has recently been proposed that evolutionary history should influence the BEF relationship because it determines species traits and, thus, species' ability to exploit resources(6,7). Here we test this hypothesis by combining experimental evolution with a BEF experiment. We isolated 20 bacterial strains from a marine environment and evolved each to be generalists or specialists(8). We then tested the effect of evolutionary history on the strength of the BEF relationship with assemblages of 1 to 20 species constructed from the specialists, generalists and ancestors(9). Assemblages of generalists were more productive on average because of their superior ability to exploit the environmental heterogeneity(10). The slope of the BEF relationship was, however, stronger for the specialist assemblages because of enhanced niche complementarity. These results show how the BEF relationship depends critically on the legacy of past evolutionary events.","[Gravel, Dominique] Univ Quebec, Dept Biol Chim & Geog, Rimouski, PQ G5L 3A1, Canada; [Gravel, Dominique; Barbera, Claire; Venail, Patrick; Mouquet, Nicolas] Univ Montpellier 2, CNRS, Inst Sci Evolut UMR 5554, F-34095 Montpellier 05, France; [Bell, Thomas] Univ Oxford, Dept Zool, Oxford OX1 3PS, England; [Bouvier, Thierry; Pommier, Thomas] Univ Montpellier 2, CNRS, Ecosyst Langunaires UMR 5119, F-34095 Montpellier 05, France; [Pommier, Thomas] Univ Lyon 1, CNRS, INRA, UMR 5557,USC 1193,Lab Ecol Microbienne, F-69622 Villeurbanne, France","Gravel, D (reprint author), Univ Quebec, Dept Biol Chim & Geog, 300 Alee Ursulines, Rimouski, PQ G5L 3A1, Canada.",dominique_gravel@uqar.qc.ca; nmouquet@univ-montp2.fr,"; Bouvier, Thierry/A-1895-2013","Bell, Thomas/0000-0002-2615-3932; Mouquet, Nicolas/0000-0003-1840-6984; ",Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; Canada Research Chair Program;  [ANR-09-JCJC-0110-01],"We thank T.

However, the composition of modern-day genomes may bear imprints of ancient biogeochemical events(3-6). Here we use an explicit model of macroevolution including gene birth, transfer, duplication and loss events to map the evolutionary history of 3,983 gene families across the three domains of life onto a geological timeline. Surprisingly, we find that a brief period of genetic innovation during the Archaean eon, which coincides with a rapid diversification of bacterial lineages, gave rise to 27% of major modern gene families. A functional analysis of genes born during this Archaean expansion reveals that they are likely to be involved in electron-transport and respiratory pathways. Genes arising after this expansion show increasing use of molecular oxygen (P = 3.4 x 10(-8)) and redox-sensitive transition metals and compounds, which is consistent with an increasingly oxygenating biosphere.","[David, Lawrence A.; Alm, Eric J.] MIT, Computat & Syst Biol Initiat, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Alm, Eric J.] MIT, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Alm, Eric J.] MIT, Dept Biol Engn, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Alm, Eric J.] Broad Inst, Cambridge, MA 02140 USA","Alm, EJ (reprint author), MIT, Computat & Syst Biol Initiat, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",ejalm@mit.edu,"David, Lawrence/B-1044-2010","David, Lawrence/0000-0002-3570-4767",US Department of Energy [DE-AC02-05CH11231]; National Science Foundation; National Defense Science and Engineering Graduate Fellowship,"We thank M.

Although crucial roles for 3'UTR-mediated gene regulation have been found in Caenorhabditis elegans(3-5), most C. elegans genes have lacked annotated 3'UTRs(6,7). Here we describe a high-throughput method for reliable identification of polyadenylated RNA termini, and we apply this method, called poly(A)-position profiling by sequencing (3P-Seq), to determine C. elegans 3'UTRs. Compared to standard methods also recently applied to C. elegans UTRs(8), 3P-Seq identified 8,580 additional UTRs while excluding thousands of shorter UTR isoforms that do not seem to be authentic. Analysis of this expanded and corrected data set suggested that the high A/U content of C. elegans 3'UTRs facilitated genome compaction, because the elements specifying cleavage and polyadenylation, which are A/U rich, can more readily emerge in A/U-rich regions. Indeed, 30% of the protein-coding genes have mRNAs with alternative, partially overlapping end regions that generate another 10,480 cleavage and polyadenylation sites that had gone largely unnoticed and represent potential evolutionary intermediates of progressive UTR shortening. Moreover, a third of the convergently transcribed genes use palindromic arrangements of bidirectional elements to specify UTRs with convergent overlap, which also contributes to genome compaction by eliminating regions between genes. Although nematode 3'UTRs have median length only one-sixth that of mammalian 3'UTRs, they have twice the density of conserved microRNA sites, in part because additional types of seed-complementary sites are preferentially conserved. These findings reveal the influence of cleavage and polyadenylation on the evolution of genome architecture and provide resources for studying post-transcriptional gene regulation.","[Jan, Calvin H.; Friedman, Robin C.; Ruby, J.

Unanswered is whether elimination of intrinsic instigators driving age-associated degeneration can reverse, as opposed to simply arrest, various afflictions of the aged. Such instigators include progressively damaged genomes. Telomerase-deficient mice have served as a model system to study the adverse cellular and organismal consequences of wide-spread endogenous DNA damage signalling activation in vivo(1). Telomere loss and uncapping provokes progressive tissue atrophy, stem cell depletion, organ system failure and impaired tissue injury responses(1). Here, we sought to determine whether entrenched multi-system degeneration in adult mice with severe telomere dysfunction can be halted or possibly reversed by reactivation of endogenous telomerase activity. To this end, we engineered a knock-in allele encoding a 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4-OHT)-inducible telomerase reverse transcriptase-oestrogen receptor (TERT-ER) under transcriptional control of the endogenous TERT promoter. Homozygous TERT-ER mice have short dysfunctional telomeres and sustain increased DNA damage signalling and classical degenerative phenotypes upon successive generational matings and advancing age. Telomerase reactivation in such late generation TERT-ER mice extends telomeres, reduces DNA damage signalling and associated cellular checkpoint responses, allows resumption of proliferation in quiescent cultures, and eliminates degenerative phenotypes across multiple organs including testes, spleens and intestines. Notably, somatic telomerase reactivation reversed neurodegeneration with restoration of proliferating Sox2(+) neural progenitors, Dcx(+) newborn neurons, and Olig2(+) oligodendrocyte populations. Consistent with the integral role of subventricular zone neural progenitors in generation and maintenance of olfactory bulb interneurons(2), this wave of telomerase-dependent neurogenesis resulted in alleviation of hyposmia and recovery of innate olfactory avoidance responses. Accumulating evidence implicating telomere damage as a driver of age-associated organ decline and disease risk(1,3) and the marked reversal of systemic degenerative phenotypes in adult mice observed here support the development of regenerative strategies designed to restore telomere integrity.","[Jaskelioff, Mariela; Muller, Florian L.; Paik, Ji-Hye; Thomas, Emily; Jiang, Shan; Sahin, Ergun; Kost-Alimova, Maria; Protopopov, Alexei; Cadinanos, Juan; Horner, James W.; DePinho, Ronald A.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Belfer Inst Appl Canc Sci, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Jaskelioff, Mariela; Muller, Florian L.; Paik, Ji-Hye; Thomas, Emily; Jiang, Shan; Sahin, Ergun; Kost-Alimova, Maria; Protopopov, Alexei; Cadinanos, Juan; Horner, James W.; DePinho, Ronald A.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dana Farber Canc Inst, Dept Med Oncol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Jaskelioff, Mariela; Muller, Florian L.; Paik, Ji-Hye; Thomas, Emily; Jiang, Shan; Sahin, Ergun; Kost-Alimova, Maria; Protopopov, Alexei; Cadinanos, Juan; Horner, James W.; DePinho, Ronald A.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dana Farber Canc Inst, Dept Med, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Jaskelioff, Mariela; Muller, Florian L.; Paik, Ji-Hye; Thomas, Emily; Jiang, Shan; Sahin, Ergun; Kost-Alimova, Maria; Protopopov, Alexei; Cadinanos, Juan; Horner, James W.; DePinho, Ronald A.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dana Farber Canc Inst, Dept Genet, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Adams, Andrew C.; Maratos-Flier, Eleftheria] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Beth Israel Deaconess Med Ctr, Div Endocrinol Diabet & Metab, Boston, MA 02215 USA","DePinho, RA (reprint author), Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Belfer Inst Appl Canc Sci, Boston, MA 02115 USA.",ron_depinho@dfci.harvard.edu,,"Muller, Florian/0000-0001-7568-2948","Susan G.

These circuits can be inhibited by bacterial effector proteins that post-translationally modify individual pathway components(3-6). However, there is emerging evidence that pathogens directly organize higher-order signalling networks through enzyme scaffolding(7,8), and the identity of the effectors and their mechanisms of action are poorly understood. Here we identify the enterohaemorrhagic Escherichia coli O157:H7 type III effector EspG as a regulator of endomembrane trafficking using a functional screen, and report ADP-ribosylation factor (ARF) GTPases and p21-activated kinases (PAKs) as its relevant host substrates. The 2.5 angstrom crystal structure of EspG in complex with ARF6 shows how EspG blocks GTPase-activating-protein-assisted GTP hydrolysis, revealing a potent mechanism of GTPase signalling inhibition at organelle membranes. In addition, the 2.8 angstrom crystal structure of EspG in complex with the autoinhibitory I alpha 3-helix of PAK2 defines a previously unknown catalytic site in EspG and provides an allosteric mechanism of kinase activation by a bacterial effector. Unexpectedly, ARF and PAKs are organized on adjacent surfaces of EspG, indicating its role as a 'catalytic scaffold' that effectively reprograms cellular events through the functional assembly of GTPase-kinase signalling complex.","[Selyunin, Andrey S.; Sutton, Sarah E.; Weigele, Bethany A.; Reddick, L.

In fission yeast, CENP-B homologues have been shown to silence long terminal repeat (LTR) retrotransposons by recruiting histone deacetylases(2). However, CENP-B factors also have unexplained roles in DNA replication(3,4). Here we show that a molecular function of CENP-B is to promote replication-fork progression through the LTR. Mutants have increased genomic instability caused by replication-fork blockage that depends on the DNA binding factor switch-activating protein 1 (Sap1), which is directly recruited by the LTR. The loss of Sap1-dependent barrier activity allows the unhindered progression of the replication fork, but results in rearrangements deleterious to the retrotransposon. We conclude that retrotransposons influence replication polarity through recruitment of Sap1 and transposition near replication-fork blocks, whereas CENP-B counteracts this activity and promotes fork stability. Our results may account for the role of LTR in fragile sites, and for the association of CENP-B with pericentromeric heterochromatin and tandem satellite repeats.","[Zaratiegui, Mikel; Vaughn, Matthew W.; Irvine, Danielle V.; Goto, Derek; Martienssen, Robert A.] Cold Spring Harbor Lab, Cold Spring Harbor, NY 11724 USA; [Watt, Stephen; Baehler, Juerg] UCL, Dept Genet Evolut & Environm, London WC1E 6BT, England; [Watt, Stephen; Baehler, Juerg] UCL Canc Inst, London WC1E 6BT, England; [Arcangioli, Benoit] Inst Pasteur, Dynam GenomeUnit, CNRS URA2171, Dept Genomes & Genet, F-75015 Paris, France; [Arcangioli, Benoit] Inst Pasteur, Dynam GenomeUnit, CNRS URA2171, Dept Dev Biol, F-75015 Paris, France","Martienssen, RA (reprint author), Cold Spring Harbor Lab, 1 Bungtown Rd, Cold Spring Harbor, NY 11724 USA.",martiens@cshl.edu,"Goto, Derek/B-7053-2009; Bahler, Jurg/B-4572-2009","Bahler, Jurg/0000-0003-4036-1532; Zaratiegui, Mikel/0000-0002-0342-0268; Vaughn, Matthew/0000-0002-1384-4283",National Institutes of Health [RO1GM076396]; Cancer Research UK [C9546/A6517]; Agence Nationale de la Recherche [ANR-06-BLAN-0271]; National Health and Medical Research Council; Spanish Ministry of Education,"We thank the Martienssen laboratory, V.

A well-known and important member of this family is the polycyclic diterpenoid Taxol (paclitaxel), which promotes tubulin polymerization(1) and shows remarkable efficacy in cancer chemotherapy(2). The first committed step of Taxol biosynthesis in the Pacific yew (Taxus brevifolia)(3) is the cyclization of the linear isoprenoid substrate geranylgeranyl diphosphate (GGPP) to form taxa-4(5), 11(12) diene(4), which is catalysed by taxadiene synthase(5). The full-length form of this diterpene cyclase contains 862 residues, but a roughly 80-residue amino-terminal transit sequence is cleaved on maturation in plastids(6). We now report the X-ray crystal structure of a truncation variant lacking the transit sequence and an additional 27 residues at the N terminus, hereafter designated TXS. Specifically, we have determined structures of TXS complexed with 13-aza-13,14-dihydrocopalyl diphosphate (1.82 angstrom resolution) and 2-fluorogeranylgeranyl diphosphate (2.25 angstrom resolution). The TXS structure reveals a modular assembly of three alpha-helical domains. The carboxy-terminal catalytic domain is a class I terpenoid cyclase, which binds and activates substrate GGPP with a three-metal ion cluster. The N-terminal domain and a third 'insertion' domain together adopt the fold of a vestigial class II terpenoid cyclase. A class II cyclase activates the isoprenoid substrate by protonation instead of ionization, and the TXS structure reveals a definitive connection between the two distinct cyclase classes in the evolution of terpenoid biosynthesis.","[Koeksal, Mustafa; Christianson, David W.] Univ Penn, Dept Chem, Roy & Diana Vagelos Labs, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Jin, Yinghua; Coates, Robert M.] Univ Illinois, Dept Chem, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Jin, Yinghua] Univ Colorado, Dept Chem & Biochem, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Croteau, Rodney] Washington State Univ, Inst Biol Chem, Pullman, WA 99164 USA","Christianson, DW (reprint author), Univ Penn, Dept Chem, Roy & Diana Vagelos Labs, 231 S 34th St, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",chris@sas.upenn.edu,,,"US National Institutes of Health [GM56838, GM13956, CA55254]; University of Illinois","We thank C.

This tooth shares no derived morphological features with Neanderthals or modern humans, further indicating that Denisovans have an evolutionary history distinct from Neanderthals and modern humans.","[Reich, David; Briggs, Adrian W.; Mallick, Swapan] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Genet, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Reich, David; Patterson, Nick; Mallick, Swapan; Li, Heng] MIT, Broad Inst, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; [Reich, David; Patterson, Nick; Mallick, Swapan; Li, Heng] Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; [Green, Richard E.; Kircher, Martin; Krause, Johannes; Viola, Bence; Briggs, Adrian W.; Stenzel, Udo; Maricic, Tomislav; Fu, Qiaomei; Meyer, Matthias; Stoneking, Mark; Kelso, Janet; Paeaebo, Svante] Max Planck Inst Evolutionary Anthropol, Dept Evolutionary Genet, D-04103 Leipzig, Germany; [Green, Richard E.] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Biomol Engn, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA; [Krause, Johannes] Univ Tubingen, Inst Nat Wissensch Archaol, D-72070 Tubingen, Germany; [Durand, Eric Y.; Slatkin, Montgomery] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Integrat Biol, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Viola, Bence; Richards, Michael; Talamo, Sahra; Hublin, Jean-Jacques] Max Planck Inst Evolutionary Anthropol, Dept Human Evolut, D-04103 Leipzig, Germany; [Johnson, Philip L.

The complex origins of impulsivity hinder identification of the genes influencing it and the diseases with which it is associated. Here we perform exon-focused sequencing of impulsive individuals in a founder population, targeting fourteen genes belonging to the serotonin and dopamine domain. A stop codon in HTR2B was identified that is common (minor allele frequency >1%) but exclusive to Finnish people. Expression of the gene in the human brain was assessed, as well as the molecular functionality of the stop codon, which was associated with psychiatric diseases marked by impulsivity in both population and family-based analyses. Knockout of Htr2b increased impulsive behaviours in mice, indicative of predictive validity. Our study shows the potential for identifying and tracing effects of rare alleles in complex behavioural phenotypes using founder populations, and indicates a role for HTR2B in impulsivity.","[Bevilacqua, Laura; Yuan, Qiaoping; Zhou, Zhifeng; Hodgkinson, Colin A.; Goldman, David] NIAAA, Neurogenet Lab, NIH, Rockville, MD 20852 USA; [Doly, Stephane; Maroteaux, Luc; Diaz, Silvina; Belmer, Arnaud] INSERM, UMR S 839, F-75654 Paris, France; [Doly, Stephane; Maroteaux, Luc; Diaz, Silvina; Belmer, Arnaud] Univ Paris 06, Inst du Fer Moulin, F-75654 Paris, France; [Kaprio, Jaakko] Univ Helsinki, Dept Publ Hlth, FI-00014 Helsinki, Finland; [Kaprio, Jaakko] Inst Mol Med, FI-00014 Helsinki, Finland; [Kaprio, Jaakko] Natl Inst Hlth & Welf, Unit Child & Adolescent Psychiat, FI-00271 Helsinki, Finland; [Tikkanen, Roope; Virkkunen, Matti] Univ Helsinki, Inst Clin Med, Dept Psychiat, FI-00014 Helsinki, Finland; [Paunio, Tiina; Suvisaari, Jaana] Univ Helsinki, Dept Psychiat, Cent Hosp, FI-00014 Helsinki, Finland; [Wedenoja, Juho] Univ Helsinki, Dept Med Genet, FI-00014 Helsinki, Finland; [Wedenoja, Juho] Univ Helsinki, Inst Mol Med Finland, FI-00014 Helsinki, Finland; [Wedenoja, Juho] Natl Inst Hlth & Welf, FI-00014 Helsinki, Finland; [Dell'Osso, Liliana] Univ Pisa, Dept Psychiat, I-56100 Pisa, Italy; [Coccaro, Emil] Univ Chicago, Pritzker Sch Med, Dept Psychiat, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Rose, Richard J.] Indiana Univ, Dept Psychol & Brain Sci, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA; [Virkkunen, Matti] Kellokoski Psychiat Hosp, FI-04500 Kellokoski, Finland","Goldman, D (reprint author), NIAAA, Neurogenet Lab, NIH, Rockville, MD 20852 USA.",davidgoldman@mail.nih.gov,"Goldman, David/F-9772-2010","Goldman, David/0000-0002-1724-5405; Kaprio, Jaakko/0000-0002-3716-2455; Wedenoja, Juho/0000-0002-6155-0378; Suvisaari, Jaana/0000-0001-7167-0990; Maroteaux, Luc/0000-0002-9499-8603","National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, NIH; Academy of Finland Centre of Excellence in Complex Disease Genetics; National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism [AA-12502, AA-09203]; Academy of Finland [100499, 205585, 118555]; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique; Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale; Universite Pierre et Marie Curie; Fondation de France; Fondation pour la Recherche Medicale; French Ministry of Research (Agence Nationale pour la Recherche); European Union; IBRO; Region Ile de France DIM STEM","This study is dedicated to the memory of L.P. and M.

So far, successful efforts have been limited to chromatin modifying enzymes, or so-called epigenetic 'writers' and 'erasers'. Potent inhibitors of histone binding modules have not yet been described. Here we report a cell-permeable small molecule (JQ1) that binds competitively to acetyl-lysine recognition motifs, or bromodomains. High potency and specificity towards a subset of human bromodomains is explained by co-crystal structures with bromodomain and extra-terminal (BET) family member BRD4, revealing excellent shape complementarity with the acetyl-lysine binding cavity. Recurrent translocation of BRD4 is observed in a genetically-defined, incurable subtype of human squamous carcinoma. Competitive binding by JQ1 displaces the BRD4 fusion oncoprotein from chromatin, prompting squamous differentiation and specific antiproliferative effects in BRD4-dependent cell lines and patient-derived xenograft models. These data establish proof-of-concept for targeting protein-protein interactions of epigenetic 'readers', and provide a versatile chemical scaffold for the development of chemical probes more broadly throughout the bromodomain family.","[Filippakopoulos, Panagis; Picaud, Sarah; Fedorov, Oleg; Keates, Tracey; Felletar, Ildiko; Philpott, Martin; Heightman, Tom D.; Knapp, Stefan] Univ Oxford, Struct Genom Consortium, Dept Clin Med, Oxford OX3 7DQ, England; [Qi, Jun; Smith, William B.; Morse, Elizabeth M.; McKeown, Michael R.; West, Nathan; Bradner, James E.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dana Farber Canc Inst, Dept Med Oncol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Shen, Yao; Wiest, Olaf] Univ Notre Dame, Dept Chem & Biochem, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA; [Shen, Yao; Wiest, Olaf] Univ Notre Dame, Walther Canc Res Ctr, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA; [Hickman, Tyler T.; Cameron, Michael J.; Schwartz, Brian; French, Christopher A.] Harvard Univ, Brigham & Womens Hosp, Sch Med, Dept Pathol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Munro, Shonagh; La Thangue, Nicholas; Knapp, Stefan] Univ Oxford, Dept Clin Pharmacol, Oxford OX3 7DQ, England; [McKeown, Michael R.; Bradner, James E.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Med, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Wang, Yuchuan] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dana Farber Canc Inst, Dept Imaging, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Christie, Amanda L.; Kung, Andrew L.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dana Farber Canc Inst, Lurie Family Imaging Ctr, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Kung, Andrew L.] Dana Farber Canc Inst, Dept Pediat Oncol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Kung, Andrew L.] Childrens Hosp, Boston, MA 02115 USA","Knapp, S (reprint author), Univ Oxford, Struct Genom Consortium, Dept Clin Med, Old Rd Campus,Roosevelt Dr, Oxford OX3 7DQ, England.",stefan.knapp@sgc.ox.ac.uk; james_bradner@dfci.harvard.edu,"; Fedorov, Oleg/B-6412-2014","Filippakopoulos, Panagis/0000-0002-1515-1317; Knapp, Stefan/0000-0001-5995-6494; Kung, Andrew/0000-0002-9091-488X; Fedorov, Oleg/0000-0001-9004-1815; Wang, Yuchuan/0000-0001-5111-6562","Canadian Institutes for Health Research [1097737]; Canadian Foundation for Innovation; Genome Canada through the Ontario Genomics Institute; GlaxoSmithKline; Karolinska Institutet; Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation; Ontario Innovation Trust; Ontario Ministry for Research and Innovation; Merck Co., Inc.; Novartis Research Foundation; Swedish Agency for Innovation Systems; Swedish Foundation for Strategic Research; Wellcome Trust; University of Notre Dame; NIGMS [T32-075762]; DF/HCC; National Institutes of Health; Burroughs Wellcome Fund; Leukemia & Lymphoma Society","We are grateful to U.

To investigate the core engine of the mitotic cycle we have generated a minimal control network in fission yeast that efficiently sustains cellular reproduction. Here we demonstrate that orderly progression through the major events of the cell cycle can be driven by oscillation of an engineered monomolecular cyclin-dependent protein kinase (CDK) module lacking much of the canonical regulation. We show further that the CDK oscillator acts as the primary organizer of the cell cycle, imposing timing and directionality to a system of two CDK activity thresholds that define independent cell cycle phases.

Such images were possible because of the wide orbits (>25 astronomical units, where 1 AU is the Earth-Sun distance) and youth (<100 Myr) of the imaged planets, which are still hot and bright as they radiate away gravitational energy acquired during their formation. An important area of contention in the exoplanet community is whether outer planets (>10 AU) more massive than Jupiter form by way of one-step gravitational instabilities(2) or, rather, through a two-step process involving accretion of a core followed by accumulation of a massive outer envelope composed primarily of hydrogen and helium(3). Here we report the presence of a fourth planet, interior to and of about the same mass as the other three. The system, with this additional planet, represents a challenge for current planet formation models as none of them can explain the in situ formation of all four planets. With its four young giant planets and known cold/warm debris belts(4), the HR 8799 planetary system is a unique laboratory in which to study the formation and evolution of giant planets at wide (>10 AU) separations.","[Marois, Christian] Natl Res Council Canada, Herzberg Inst Astrophys, Victoria, BC V9E 2E7, Canada; [Zuckerman, B.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Phys & Astron, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Konopacky, Quinn M.; Macintosh, Bruce] Lawrence Livermore Natl Lab, Livermore, CA 94550 USA; [Barman, Travis] Lowell Observ, Flagstaff, AZ 86001 USA","Marois, C (reprint author), Natl Res Council Canada, Herzberg Inst Astrophys, 5071 W Saanich Rd, Victoria, BC V9E 2E7, Canada.",christian.marois@nrc-cnrc.gc.ca,,,US Department of Energy by LLNL; NSF Center for Adaptive Optics; NASA,"We thank the Keck staff, particularly H.

This interaction provides a way to control spins electrically and thus lies at the foundation of spintronics(1). Even at the level of single electrons, the spin-orbit interaction has proven promising for coherent spin rotations(2). Here we implement a spin-orbit quantum bit (qubit) in an indium arsenide nanowire, where the spin-orbit interaction is so strong that spin and motion can no longer be separated(3,4). In this regime, we realize fast qubit rotations and universal single-qubit control using only electric fields; the qubits are hosted in single-electron quantum dots that are individually addressable. We enhance coherence by dynamically decoupling the qubits from the environment. Nanowires offer various advantages for quantum computing: they can serve as one-dimensional templates for scalable qubit registers, and it is possible to vary the material even during wire growth(5). Such flexibility can be used to design wires with suppressed decoherence and to push semiconductor qubit fidelities towards error correction levels. Furthermore, electrical dots can be integrated with optical dots in p-n junction nanowires(6). The coherence times achieved here are sufficient for the conversion of an electronic qubit into a photon, which can serve as a flying qubit for long-distance quantum communication.","[Nadj-Perge, S.; Frolov, S.

For example, graphene is regarded as a promising candidate for future devices, and the electronic properties of nanodevices constructed from this material are in large part governed by the edge structures(1). The atomic configurations at graphene boundaries have been investigated by transmission electron microscopy and scanning tunnelling microscopy(2-4), but the electronic properties of these edge states have not yet been determined with atomic resolution. Whereas simple elemental analysis at the level of single atoms can now be achieved by means of annular dark field imaging(5) or electron energy-loss spectroscopy(6,7), obtaining fine-structure spectroscopic information about individual light atoms such as those of carbon has been hampered by a combination of extremely weak signals and specimen damage by the electron beam. Here we overcome these difficulties to demonstrate site-specific single-atom spectroscopy at a graphene boundary, enabling direct investigation of the electronic and bonding structures of the edge atoms-in particular, discrimination of single-, double- and triple-coordinated carbon atoms is achieved with atomic resolution. By demonstrating how rich chemical information can be obtained from single atoms through energy-loss near-edge fine-structure analysis(8), our results should open the way to exploring the local electronic structures of various nanodevices and individual molecules.","[Suenaga, Kazu; Koshino, Masanori] Natl Inst Adv Ind Sci & Technol, Nanotube Res Ctr, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058565, Japan","Suenaga, K (reprint author), Natl Inst Adv Ind Sci & Technol, Nanotube Res Ctr, AIST Cent 5, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058565, Japan.",suenaga-kazu@aist.go.jp,"Suenaga, Kazu/E-2339-2014","Suenaga, Kazu/0000-0002-6107-1123",JST,This work is partially supported by the JST-CREST programme.

Such superplastic behaviour has been speculated for decades to take place in geological materials, ranging from surface ice sheets to the Earth's lowermantle(2-8). In materials science, superplasticity is confirmed when the material deforms with large tensile strain without failure; however, no experimental studies have yet shown this characteristic in geomaterials. Here we show that polycrystalline forsterite + periclase (9:1) and forsterite 1 enstatite + diopside (7:2.5:0.5), which are good analogues for Earth's mantle, undergo homogeneous elongation of up to 500 per cent under subsolidus conditions. Such superplastic deformation is accompanied by strain hardening, which is well explained by the grain size sensitivity of superplasticity and grain growth under grain switching conditions (that is, grain boundary sliding); grain boundary sliding is the main deformation mechanism for superplasticity. We apply the observed strain-grain size-viscosity relationship to portions of the mantle where superplasticity has been presumed to take place, such as localized shear zones in the upper mantle and within subducting slabs penetrating into the transition zone and lower mantle after a phase transformation. Calculations show that superplastic flow in the mantle is inevitably accompanied by significant grain growth that can bring fine grained (<= 1 mu m) rocks to coarse-grained (1-10 mm) aggregates, resulting in increasing mantle viscosity and finally termination of superplastic flow.","[Hiraga, Takehiko; Miyazaki, Tomonori; Tasaka, Miki] Univ Tokyo, Earthquake Res Inst, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo 1130032, Japan; [Yoshida, Hidehiro] Natl Inst Mat Sci, Nano Ceram Ctr, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3050047, Japan","Hiraga, T (reprint author), Univ Tokyo, Earthquake Res Inst, Bunkyo Ku, 1-1-1 Yayoi, Tokyo 1130032, Japan.",hiraga@eri.u-tokyo.ac.jp,"YOSHIDA, Hidehiro/H-2529-2011",,JSPS [A 20684024]; Earthquake Research Institute;  [A 19686042];  [B 21360328];  [474-19053008],"Technical support from S.

These tumours are thought to arise within the cerebellum, with approximately 25% originating from granule neuron precursor cells (GNPCs) after aberrant activation of the Sonic Hedgehog pathway (hereafter, SHH subtype)(3-8). The pathological processes that drive heterogeneity among the other medulloblastoma subtypes are not known, hindering the development of much needed new therapies. Here we provide evidence that a discrete subtype of medulloblastoma that contains activating mutations in the WNT pathway effector CTNNB1 (hereafter, WNT subtype) 1,3,4 arises outside the cerebellum from cells of the dorsal brainstem. We found that genes marking human WNT-subtype medulloblastomas are more frequently expressed in the lower rhombic lip (LRL) and embryonic dorsal brainstem than in the upper rhombic lip (URL) and developing cerebellum. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and intra-operative reports showed that human WNT-subtype tumours infiltrate the dorsal brainstem, whereas SHH-subtype tumours are located within the cerebellar hemispheres. Activating mutations in Ctnnb1 had little impact on progenitor cell populations in the cerebellum, but caused the abnormal accumulation of cells on the embryonic dorsal brainstem which included aberrantly proliferating Zic1(+) precursor cells. These lesions persisted in all mutant adult mice; moreover, in 15% of cases in which Tp53 was concurrently deleted, they progressed to form medulloblastomas that recapitulated the anatomy and gene expression profiles of human WNT-subtype medulloblastoma. We provide the first evidence, to our knowledge, that subtypes of medulloblastoma have distinct cellular origins. Our data provide an explanation for the marked molecular and clinical differences between SHH- and WNT-subtype medulloblastomas and have profound implications for future research and treatment of this important childhood cancer.","[Gibson, Paul; Tong, Yiai; Robinson, Giles; Currle, D.

Progress has been made in the identification of mTORC1 pathway components and in understanding their functions in cells, but there is relatively little known about the role of the pathway in vivo. Specifically, we have little knowledge regarding the role mTOCR1 has in liver physiology. In fasted animals, the liver performs numerous functions that maintain whole-body homeostasis, including the production of ketone bodies for peripheral tissues to use as energy sources. Here we show that mTORC1 controls ketogenesis in mice in response to fasting. We find that liver-specific loss of TSC1 (tuberous sclerosis 1), an mTORC1 inhibitor(1), leads to a fasting-resistant increase in liver size, and to a pronounced defect in ketone body production and ketogenic gene expression on fasting. The loss of raptor (regulatory associated protein of mTOR, complex 1) an essential mTORC1 component(1), has the opposite effects. In addition, we find that the inhibition of mTORC1 is required for the fasting-induced activation of PPAR alpha (peroxisome proliferator activated receptor alpha), the master transcriptional activator of ketogenic genes(2), and that suppression of NCoR1 (nuclear receptor co-repressor 1), a co-repressor of PPAR alpha(3), reactivates ketogenesis in cells and livers with hyperactive mTORC1 signalling. Like livers with activated mTORC1, livers from aged mice have a defect in ketogenesis(4,5), which correlates with an increase in mTORC1 signalling. Moreover, we show that the suppressive effects of mTORC1 activation and ageing on PPAR alpha activity and ketone production are not additive, and that mTORC1 inhibition is sufficient to prevent the ageing-induced defect in ketogenesis. Thus, our findings reveal that mTORC1 is a key regulator of PPAR alpha function and hepatic ketogenesis and suggest a role for mTORC1 activity in promoting the ageing of the liver.","[Sengupta, Shomit; Peterson, Timothy R.; Laplante, Mathieu; Oh, Stephanie; Sabatini, David M.] Nine Cambridge Ctr, Whitehead Inst Biomed Res, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; [Sengupta, Shomit; Peterson, Timothy R.; Laplante, Mathieu; Oh, Stephanie; Sabatini, David M.] MIT, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Dept Biol, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Sengupta, Shomit; Peterson, Timothy R.; Laplante, Mathieu; Oh, Stephanie; Sabatini, David M.] MIT, David H Koch Inst Integrat Canc Res, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA","Sabatini, DM (reprint author), Nine Cambridge Ctr, Whitehead Inst Biomed Res, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA.",sabatini@wi.mit.edu,,"Oh, Stephanie/0000-0002-6287-9116; /0000-0002-1446-7256","American Diabetes Association; Ludwig Cancer Fund; Canadian Institutes of Health Research; NIH [CA103866, CA129105]","We thank S.

Although increasing evidence demonstrates that tumour progression entails chromatin-mediated changes such as DNA methylation, the role of histone variants in cancer initiation and progression currently remains unclear. Histone variants replace conventional histones within the nucleosome and confer unique biological functions to chromatin(1-3). Here we report that the histone variant macroH2A (mH2A) suppresses tumour progression of malignant melanoma. Loss of mH2A isoforms, histone variants generally associated with condensed chromatin and fine-tuning of developmental gene expression programs(1,4-6), is positively correlated with increasing malignant phenotype of melanoma cells in culture and human tissue samples. Knockdown of mH2A isoforms in melanoma cells of low malignancy results in significantly increased proliferation and migration in vitro and growth and metastasis in vivo. Restored expression of mH2A isoforms rescues these malignant phenotypes in vitro and in vivo. We demonstrate that the tumour-promoting function of mH2A loss is mediated, at least in part, through direct transcriptional upregulation of CDK8. Suppression of CDK8, a colorectal cancer oncogene(7,8), inhibits proliferation of melanoma cells, and knockdown of CDK8 in cells depleted of mH2A suppresses the proliferative advantage induced by mH2A loss. Moreover, a significant inverse correlation between mH2A and CDK8 expression levels exists in melanoma patient samples. Taken together, our results demonstrate that mH2A is a critical component of chromatin that suppresses the development of malignant melanoma, a highly intractable cutaneous neoplasm.","[Kapoor, Avnish; Goldberg, Matthew S.; Cumberland, Lara K.; Ratnakumar, Kajan; Vardabasso, Chiara; Bernstein, Emily] Mt Sinai Sch Med, Dept Oncol Sci, New York, NY 10029 USA; [Kapoor, Avnish; Goldberg, Matthew S.; Cumberland, Lara K.; Ratnakumar, Kajan; Emanuel, Patrick O.; Vardabasso, Chiara; Vidal, Claudia I.; Bernstein, Emily] Mt Sinai Sch Med, Dept Dermatol, New York, NY 10029 USA; [Emanuel, Patrick O.; Vidal, Claudia I.] Mt Sinai Sch Med, Dept Pathol, New York, NY 10029 USA; [Segura, Miguel F.; Menendez, Silvia; Polsky, David; Hernando, Eva] NYU, Dept Pathol, Langone Med Ctr, New York, NY 10016 USA; [Polsky, David; Osman, Iman] NYU, Dept Dermatol, Langone Med Ctr, New York, NY 10016 USA; [Segura, Miguel F.; Menendez, Silvia; Polsky, David; Osman, Iman; Hernando, Eva] NYU, Interdisciplinary Melanoma Cooperat Grp, Langone Med Ctr, New York, NY 10016 USA; [LeRoy, Gary; Garcia, Benjamin A.] Princeton Univ, Dept Mol Biol, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA","Bernstein, E (reprint author), Mt Sinai Sch Med, Dept Oncol Sci, 1425 Madison Ave, New York, NY 10029 USA.",emily.bernstein@mssm.edu,"Segura, Miguel/J-4749-2013","Segura, Miguel F./0000-0003-0916-3618; Hernando, Eva/0000-0003-1023-0312",American Skin Association; American Society for Mass Spectrometry; New Jersey Commission on Cancer Research; National Science Foundation [CBET-0941143]; National Institutes of Health [CA109388]; Sergei S.

In epithelia, contractile forces are resisted at apical junctions by adhesive forces dependent on E-cadherin(16), which also transmits tension(6,17-19). During Drosophila embryonic germband extension, tissue elongation is driven by cell intercalation(20), which requires an irreversible and planar polarized remodelling of epithelial cell junctions(4,5). We investigate how cell deformations emerge from the interplay between force generation and cortical force transmission during this remodelling in Drosophila melanogaster. The shrinkage of dorsal-ventral-oriented ('vertical') junctions during this process is known to require planar polarized junctional contractility by Myosin II (refs 4,5,7,12). Here we show that this shrinkage is not produced by junctional Myosin II itself, but by the polarized flow of medial actomyosin pulses towards 'vertical' junctions. This anisotropic flow is oriented by the planar polarized distribution of E-cadherin complexes, in that medial Myosin II flows towards 'vertical' junctions, which have relatively less E-cadherin than transverse junctions. Our evidence suggests that the medial flow pattern reflects equilibrium properties of force transmission and coupling to E-cadherin by a-Catenin. Thus, epithelial morphogenesis is not properly reflected by Myosin II steady state distribution but by polarized contractile actomyosin flows that emerge from interactions between E-cadherin and actomyosin networks.","[Rauzi, Matteo; Lenne, Pierre-Francois; Lecuit, Thomas] Univ Aix Marseille 2, CNRS, IBDML, UMR6216, F-13288 Marseille 09, France","Lecuit, T (reprint author), Univ Aix Marseille 2, CNRS, IBDML, UMR6216, Campus Luminy,Case 907, F-13288 Marseille 09, France.",lenne@ibdml.univ-mrs.fr; lecuit@ibdml.univ-mrs.fr,,"Lenne, Pierre-Francois/0000-0003-1066-7506",HFSP; CNRS; Fondation pour la Recherche Medicale; ANR-Blanc; Region PACA; ANR-PCV; Amplitude Systems,"We thank R.

In the presence of Ca2+/calmodulin, eNOS produces NO, endothelial-derived relaxing factor, from L-arginine (L-Arg) by means of electron transfer from NADPH through a flavin containing reductase domain to oxygen bound at the haem of an oxygenase domain, which also contains binding sites for tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) and L-Arg(1-3). In the absence of BH4, NO synthesis is abrogated and instead O-2(center dot-) is generated(4-7). While NOS dysfunction occurs in diseases with redox stress, BH4 repletion only partly restores NOS activity and NOS-dependent vasodilation(7). This suggests that there is an as yet unidentified redox-regulated mechanism controlling NOS function. Protein thiols can undergo S-glutathionylation, a reversible protein modification involved in cellular signalling and adaptation(8,9). Under oxidative stress, S-glutathionylation occurs through thiol-disulphide exchange with oxidized glutathione or reaction of oxidant-induced protein thiyl radicals with reduced glutathione(10,11). Cysteine residues are critical for the maintenance of eNOS function(12,13); we therefore speculated that oxidative stress could alter eNOS activity through S-glutathionylation. Here we show that S-glutathionylation of eNOS reversibly decreases NOS activity with an increase in O-2(center dot-) generation primarily from the reductase, in which two highly conserved cysteine residues are identified as sites of S-glutathionylation and found to be critical for redox-regulation of eNOS function. We show that eNOS S-glutathionylation in endothelial cells, with loss of NO and gain of O-2(center dot-) generation, is associated with impaired endothelium-dependent vasodilation. In hypertensive vessels, eNOS S-glutathionylation is increased with impaired endothelium-dependent vasodilation that is restored by thiol-specific reducing agents, which reverse this S-glutathionylation. Thus, S-glutathionylation of eNOS is a pivotal switch providing redox regulation of cellular signalling, endothelial function and vascular tone.","[Chen, Chun-An; Wang, Tse-Yao; Varadharaj, Saradhadevi; Reyes, Levy A.; Hemann, Craig; Talukder, M.

This response, although vital for immune defence, is frequently deleterious to the host due to the exaggerated production of inflammatory proteins. The scope of inflammatory responses reflects the activation state of signalling proteins upstream of inflammatory genes as well as signal-induced assembly of nuclear chromatin complexes that support mRNA expression(1-4). Recognition of post-translationally modified histones by nuclear proteins that initiate mRNA transcription and support mRNA elongation is a critical step in the regulation of gene expression(5-10). Here we present a novel pharmacological approach that targets inflammatory gene expression by interfering with the recognition of acetylated histones by the bromodomain and extra terminal domain (BET) family of proteins. We describe a synthetic compound (I-BET) that by 'mimicking' acetylated histones disrupts chromatin complexes responsible for the expression of key inflammatory genes in activated macrophages, and confers protection against lipopolysaccharide-induced endotoxic shock and bacteria-induced sepsis. Our findings suggest that synthetic compounds specifically targeting proteins that recognize post-translationally modified histones can serve as a new generation of immunomodulatory drugs.","[Jeffrey, Kate L.; Schaefer, Uwe; Chandwani, Rohit; Marazzi, Ivan; Tarakhovsky, Alexander] Rockefeller Univ, Lab Lymphocyte Signaling, New York, NY 10065 USA; [Nicodeme, Edwige; Coste, Herve; Kirilovsky, Jorge] Ctr Res GSK, F-91140 Villebon Sur Yvette, France; [Beinke, Soren; Lora, Jose M.; Prinjha, Rab K.; Lee, Kevin] GlaxoSmithKline Inc, Med Res Ctr, Epinova DPU, Immunoinflammat Ctr Excellence Drug Discovery, Stevenage SG1 2NY, Herts, England; [Dewell, Scott] Rockefeller Univ, Genom Resource Ctr, New York, NY 10065 USA; [Chung, Chun-wa; Wilson, Paul; White, Julia] GlaxoSmithKline R&D, Med Res Ctr, Stevenage SG1 2NY, Herts, England; [Rice, Charles M.] Rockefeller Univ, Lab Virol & Infect Dis, New York, NY 10065 USA","Tarakhovsky, A (reprint author), Rockefeller Univ, Lab Lymphocyte Signaling, 1230 York Ave, New York, NY 10065 USA.",Kevin.2.Lee@gsk.com; tarakho@rockefeller.edu,,,NIHKL2 Career Development Award; American Italian Cancer Foundation; National Health and Medical Research Council of Australia,"We would like to acknowledge R.

One example of such an epigenetic mark is the mono-ubiquitination of histones, which mainly occurs at histone H2A and H2B(4-6). Ubiquitination of histone H2A has been implicated in polycomb-mediated transcriptional silencing(7-9). However, the precise role of the ubiquitin mark during silencing is still elusive. Here we show in human cell lines that ZRF1 (zuotin-related factor 1) is specifically recruited to histone H2A when it is ubiquitinated at Lys 119 by means of a novel ubiquitin-interacting domain that is located in the evolutionarily conserved zuotin domain. At the onset of differentiation, ZRF1 specifically displaces polycomb-repressive complex 1 (PRC1) from chromatin and facilitates transcriptional activation. A genome-wide mapping of ZRF1, RING1B and H2A-ubiquitin targets revealed its involvement in the regulation of a large set of polycomb target genes, emphasizing the key role ZRF1 has in cell fate decisions. We provide here a model of the molecular mechanism of switching polycomb-repressed genes to an active state.","[Richly, Holger; Rocha-Viegas, Luciana; Domingues Ribeiro, Joana; Demajo, Santiago; Di Croce, Luciano] UPF, CRG, Barcelona 08003, Spain; [Gundem, Gunes; Lopez-Bigas, Nuria] Univ Pompeu Fabra, Dept Expt & Hlth Sci, Barcelona 08003, Spain; [Nakagawa, Tekeya; Ito, Takashi] Nagasaki Univ, Sch Med, Nagasaki 8528523, Japan; [Rospert, Sabine] Univ Freiburg, Inst Biochem & Mol Biol ZBMZ, D-79104 Freiburg, Germany; [Di Croce, Luciano] PRBB, CRG, ICREA, Barcelona 08003, Spain","Di Croce, L (reprint author), UPF, CRG, Barcelona 08003, Spain.",luciano.dicroce@crg.es,"Ribeiro, Joana/K-3357-2014; Di Croce, Luciano/E-7759-2015; Lopez-Bigas, Nuria/F-6193-2011","Ribeiro, Joana/0000-0003-2221-4002; Di Croce, Luciano/0000-0003-3488-6228; Lopez-Bigas, Nuria/0000-0003-4925-8988; Rospert, Sabine/0000-0002-3089-9614","Spanish ""Ministerio de Educacion y Ciencia'' [BFU2007-63059]; Association for International Cancer Research [10-0177]; AGAUR; Consolider; FEBS fellowship; Fundacao para a Ciencia e Tecnologia; Juan de la Cierva Fellowship; PFIS fellowship;  [FOR967]; ICREA","We are indebted to S.

NSSs are essential to the function of chemical synapses, are associated with multiple neurological diseases and disorders(4), and are the targets of therapeutic and illicit drugs(5). LeuT, a prokaryotic orthologue of the NSS family, is a model transporter for understanding the relationships between molecular mechanism and atomic structure in a broad range of sodium-dependent and sodium-independent secondary transporters(6-13). At present there is a controversy over whether there are one or two high-affinity substrate binding sites in LeuT. The first-reported crystal structure of LeuT, together with subsequent functional and structural studies, provided direct evidence for a single, high-affinity, centrally located substrate-binding site, defined as the S1 site(14,15). Recent binding, flux and molecular simulation studies, however, have been interpreted in terms of a model where there are two high-affinity binding sites: the central, S1, site and a second, the S2 site, located within the extracellular vestibule(16). Furthermore, it was proposed that the S1 and S2 sites are allosterically coupled such that occupancy of the S2 site is required for the cytoplasmic release of substrate from the S1 site(16). Here we address this controversy by performing direct measurement of substrate binding to wild-type LeuT and to S2 site mutants using isothermal titration calorimetry, equilibrium dialysis and scintillation proximity assays. In addition, we perform uptake experiments to determine whether the proposed allosteric coupling between the putative S2 site and the S1 site manifests itself in the kinetics of substrate flux. We conclude that LeuT harbours a single, centrally located, high-affinity substrate-binding site and that transport is well described by a simple, single-substrate kinetic mechanism.","[Piscitelli, Chayne L.; Krishnamurthy, Harini; Gouaux, Eric] Oregon Hlth & Sci Univ, Vollum Inst, Portland, OR 97239 USA; [Piscitelli, Chayne L.] Oregon Hlth & Sci Univ, Dept Biochem & Mol Biol, Portland, OR 97239 USA; [Gouaux, Eric] Oregon Hlth & Sci Univ, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Portland, OR 97239 USA","Gouaux, E (reprint author), Oregon Hlth & Sci Univ, Vollum Inst, 3181 SW Sam Jackson Pk Rd, Portland, OR 97239 USA.",gouauxe@ohsu.edu,,,ARCS foundation; NIH [T32 DK007680],We thank T.

These class IV dendritic arborization neurons, which are present in every body segment, have dendrites tiling the larval body wall nearly completely without redundancy. Dendritic illumination activates class IV dendritic arborization neurons.

Readers that simultaneously recognize histones with multiple marks allow transduction of complex chromatin modification patterns into specific biological outcomes. Here we report that chromatin regulator tripartite motif-containing 24 (TRIM24) functions in humans as a reader of dual histone marks by means of tandem plant homeodomain (PHD) and bromodomain (Bromo) regions. The three-dimensional structure of the PHD-Bromo region of TRIM24 revealed a single functional unit for combinatorial recognition of unmodified H3K4 (that is, histone H3 unmodified at lysine 4, H3K4me0) and acetylated H3K23 (histone H3 acetylated at lysine 23, H3K23ac) within the same histone tail. TRIM24 binds chromatin and oestrogen receptor to activate oestrogen-dependent genes associated with cellular proliferation and tumour development. Aberrant expression of TRIM24 negatively correlates with survival of breast cancer patients. The PHD-Bromo of TRIM24 provides a structural rationale for chromatin activation through a non-canonical histone signature, establishing a new route by which chromatin readers may influence cancer pathogenesis.","[Wang, Zhanxin; Patel, Dinshaw J.] Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Struct Biol Program, New York, NY 10065 USA; [Tsai, Wen-Wei; Yiu, Teresa T.; Shi, Xiaobing; Barton, Michelle Craig] Univ Texas MD Anderson Canc Ctr, Grad Sch Biomed Sci, Program Genes & Dev, Dept Biochem & Mol Biol, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Yiu, Teresa T.; Akdemir, Kadir C.; Shi, Xiaobing; Barton, Michelle Craig] Univ Texas MD Anderson Canc Ctr, Ctr Canc Epigenet, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Yiu, Teresa T.; Akdemir, Kadir C.; Shi, Xiaobing; Barton, Michelle Craig] Univ Texas MD Anderson Canc Ctr, Ctr Stem Cell & Dev Biol, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Xia, Weiya; Hung, Mien-Chie] Univ Texas MD Anderson Canc Ctr, Dept Mol & Cellular Oncol, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Akdemir, Kadir C.] Univ Texas MD Anderson Canc Ctr, Dept Biostat & Bioinformat, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Winter, Stefan; Fischle, Wolfgang] Max Planck Inst Biophys Chem, Lab Chromatin Biochem, D-37077 Gottingen, Germany; [Tsai, Cheng-Yu; Plunkett, William] Univ Texas MD Anderson Canc Ctr, Dept Expt Therapeut, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Schwarzer, Dirk] Leibniz Inst Mol Pharmakol FMP, Dept Chem Biol Prot Chem, D-13125 Berlin, Germany; [Aronow, Bruce] Cincinnati Childrens Hosp Med Ctr, Computat Med Ctr, Cincinnati, OH 45229 USA; [Gozani, Or] Stanford Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Hung, Mien-Chie] China Med Univ & Hosp, Grad Inst Canc Biol, Taichung 404, Taiwan; [Hung, Mien-Chie] China Med Univ & Hosp, Ctr Mol Med, Taichung 404, Taiwan","Patel, DJ (reprint author), Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Struct Biol Program, New York, NY 10065 USA.",pateld@mskcc.org; mbarton@mdanderson.org,"Wang, Zhanxin/A-7967-2012; Aronow, Bruce/F-8438-2012","Schwarzer, Dirk/0000-0002-7477-3319; Barton, Michelle/0000-0002-4042-1374; Shi, Xiaobing/0000-0001-5242-8189","National Institutes of Health (NIH) [GM081627, U54 RR025216, P30DK078392-01, GM079641]; George and Cynthia Mitchell Foundation; China Medical University and Hospital; MDACC; Starr Foundation; Leukemia and Lymphoma Society; Max Planck Society; NCI Cancer Center; Sowell-Huggins Foundation; EMBO; Center for Cancer Epigenetics;  [T32 HD07325]","This work was supported by funds from the National Institutes of Health (NIH GM081627) and the George and Cynthia Mitchell Foundation (to M.

Triggering of beta-adrenergic receptors in adipocytes stimulates energy expenditure by cyclic AMP (cAMP)-dependent increases in lipolysis and fatty-acid oxidation. Although the mechanism is unclear, catecholamine signalling is thought to be disrupted in obesity, leading to the development of insulin resistance. Here we show that the cAMP response element binding (CREB) coactivator Crtc3 promotes obesity by attenuating beta-adrenergic receptor signalling in adipose tissue. Crtc3 was activated in response to catecholamine signals, when it reduced adenyl cyclase activity by upregulating the expression of Rgs2, a GTPase-activating protein that also inhibits adenyl cyclase activity. As a common human CRTC3 variant with increased transcriptional activity is associated with adiposity in two distinct Mexican-American cohorts, these results suggest that adipocyte CRTC3 may play a role in the development of obesity in humans.","[Song, Youngsup; Altarejos, Judith; Inoue, Hiroshi; Berdeaux, Rebecca; Kim, Jeong-Ho; Goode, Jason; Igata, Motoyuki; Paz, Jose C.; Hogan, Meghan F.; Singh, Pankaj K.; Goebel, Naomi; Vera, Lili; Miller, Nina; Montminy, Marc] Salk Inst Biol Studies, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; [Goodarzi, Mark O.; Jones, Michelle R.] Cedars Sinai Med Ctr, Dept Med, Div Endocrinol Diabet & Metab, Los Angeles, CA 90048 USA; [Guo, Xiuqing; Cui, Jinrui; Chen, Yii-Der I.; Taylor, Kent D.; Rotter, Jerome I.] Cedars Sinai Med Ctr, Inst Med Genet, Los Angeles, CA 90048 USA; [Hsueh, Willa A.] Methodist Hosp, Res Inst, Diabet Res Ctr, Div Diabet Obes & Lipids, Houston, TX 77030 USA","Montminy, M (reprint author), Salk Inst Biol Studies, 10010 N Torrey Pines Rd, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA.",montminy@salk.edu,"Paz, Jose Carlos/I-5783-2015","Paz, Jose Carlos/0000-0001-9684-9735; Berdeaux, Rebecca/0000-0002-9929-1711; Song, Youngsup/0000-0002-6268-5223","National Institutes of Health [R01-DK049777, R01-DK083834, P30-DK063491, R01-HL088457, R01-DK79888, R01-HL071205, N01-HC95159, N02-HL64278, M01-RR00425]; Cedars-Sinai Board of Governor's Chair in Medical Genetics","This study was supported in part by National Institutes of Health grants R01-DK049777, R01-DK083834, P30-DK063491, R01-HL088457, R01-DK79888, R01-HL071205, N01-HC95159, N02-HL64278 and M01-RR00425 (General Clinical Research Center Grant from the National Center for Research Resources, The J.W.

The IMF is reasonably well constrained in the disk of the Milky Way(1) but we have very little direct information on the form of the IMF in other galaxies and at earlier cosmic epochs. Here we report observations of the Na I doublet(2,3) and the Wing-Ford molecular FeH band(4,5) in the spectra of elliptical galaxies. These lines are strong in stars with masses less than 0.3 M(circle dot) (where M(circle dot) is the mass of the Sun) and are weak or absent in all other types of stars(5-7). We unambiguously detect both signatures, consistent with previous studies(8) that were based on data of lower signal-to-noise ratio. The direct detection of the light of low-mass stars implies that they are very abundant in elliptical galaxies, making up over 80% of the total number of stars and contributing more than 60% of the total stellar mass. We infer that the IMF in massive star-forming galaxies in the early Universe produced many more low-mass stars than the IMF in the Milky Way disk, and was probably slightly steeper than the Salpeter form(9) in the mass range 0.1 M(circle dot) to 1 M(circle dot).","[van Dokkum, Pieter G.] Yale Univ, Dept Astron, New Haven, CT 06511 USA; [Conroy, Charlie] Princeton Univ, Dept Astrophys Sci, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Conroy, Charlie] Harvard Smithsonian Ctr Astrophys, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA","van Dokkum, PG (reprint author), Yale Univ, Dept Astron, New Haven, CT 06511 USA.",pieter.vandokkum@yale.edu,,,,,,30,244,244,2,11,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,16-Dec,2010,468,7326,,,,,940,942,,10.1038/nature09578,,3,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,695BC,WOS:000285344600041,21124316,No,Y,N,11/20/17

The current rings are more than 90 to 95 per cent water ice(1), which implies that initially they were almost pure ice because they are continually polluted by rocky meteoroids(2). In contrast, a half-rock, half-ice mixture (similar to the composition of many of the satellites in the outer Solar System) would generally be expected. Previous ring origin theories invoke the collisional disruption of a small moon(3,4), or the tidal disruption of a comet during a close passage by Saturn(5). These models are improbable and/or struggle to account for basic properties of the rings, including their icy composition. Saturn has only one large satellite, Titan, whereas Jupiter has four large satellites; additional large satellites probably existed originally but were lost as they spiralled into Saturn(6). Here I report numerical simulations of the tidal removal of mass from a differentiated, Titan-sized satellite as it migrates inward towards Saturn. Planetary tidal forces preferentially strip material from the satellite's outer icy layers, while its rocky core remains intact and is lost to collision with the planet. The result is a pure ice ring much more massive than Saturn's current rings. As the ring evolves, its mass decreases and icy moons are spawned from its outer edge(7) with estimated masses consistent with Saturn's ice-rich moons interior to and including Tethys.","SW Res Inst, Planetary Sci Directorate, Boulder, CO 80302 USA","Canup, RM (reprint author), SW Res Inst, Planetary Sci Directorate, 1050 Walnut St,Suite 300, Boulder, CO 80302 USA.",robin@boulder.swri.edu,,,NASA,I thank W.

Introducing heptagons and pentagons (defects with topological charge) makes it easier to tile curved surfaces; for example, soccer balls based on the geodesic domes(1) of Buckminster Fuller have exactly 12 pentagons (positive charges). Interacting particles that invariably form hexagonal crystals on a plane exhibit fascinating scarred defect patterns on a sphere(2-4). Here we show that, for more general curved surfaces, curvature may be relaxed by pleats: uncharged lines of dislocations (topological dipoles) that vanish on the surface and play the same role as fabric pleats. We experimentally investigate crystal order on surfaces with spatially varying positive and negative curvature. On cylindrical capillary bridges, stretched to produce negative curvature, we observe a sequence of transitions-consistent with our energetic calculations-from no defects to isolated dislocations, which subsequently proliferate and organize into pleats; finally, scars and isolated heptagons (previously unseen) appear. This fine control of crystal order with curvature will enable explorations of general theories of defects in curved spaces(5-11). From a practical viewpoint, it may be possible to engineer structures with curvature (such as waisted nanotubes and vaulted architecture) and to develop novel methods for soft lithography(12) and directed self-assembly(13).","[Irvine, William T.

The strength and structure of the internal field are poorly known(2-5), yet the details are important for our understanding of the geodynamo. Here I obtain an indirect estimate for the field strength from measurements of tidal dissipation. Tidally driven flow in the Earth's liquid core develops internal shear layers, which distort the internal magnetic field and generate electric currents. Ohmic losses damp the tidal motions and produce detectable signatures in the Earth's nutations. Previously reported evidence of anomalous dissipation in nutations(3,6) can be explained with a core-averaged field of 2.5 mT, eliminating the need for high fluid viscosity(6) or a stronger magnetic field at the inner-core boundary(3). Estimates for the internal field constrain the power required for the geodynamo(7,8).","Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA","Buffett, BA (reprint author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",bbuffett@berkeley.edu,,,,,,26,33,33,3,18,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,16-Dec,2010,468,7326,,,,,952,U345,,10.1038/nature09643,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,695BC,WOS:000285344600044,21164483,No,,,11/20/17

That projection, however, did not consider the possible benefits of greenhouse gas mitigation. A key question is whether temperature increases lead to proportional losses of sea-ice habitat, or whether sea-ice cover crosses a tipping point and irreversibly collapses when temperature reaches a critical threshold(4-6). Such a tipping point would mean future greenhouse gas mitigation would confer no conservation benefits to polar bears. Here we show, using a general circulation model(7), that substantially more sea-ice habitat would be retained if greenhouse gas rise is mitigated. We also show, with Bayesian network model outcomes, that increased habitat retention under greenhouse gas mitigation means that polar bears could persist throughout the century in greater numbers and more areas than in the business-as-usual case(3). Our general circulation model outcomes did not reveal thresholds leading to irreversible loss of ice(6); instead, a linear relationship between global mean surface air temperature and sea-ice habitat substantiated the hypothesis that sea-ice thermodynamics can overcome albedo feedbacks proposed to cause sea-ice tipping points(5,6,8). Our outcomes indicate that rapid summer ice losses in models(9) and observations(6,10) represent increased volatility of a thinning sea-ice cover, rather than tipping-point behaviour. Mitigation-driven Bayesian network outcomes show that previously predicted declines in polar bear distribution and numbers(3) are not unavoidable. Because polar bears are sentinels of the Arctic marine ecosystem(11) and trends in their sea-ice habitats foreshadow future global changes, mitigating greenhouse gas emissions to improve polar bear status would have conservation benefits throughout and beyond the Arctic(12).","[Amstrup, Steven C.; Durner, George M.] US Geol Survey, Alaska Sci Ctr, Anchorage, AK 99508 USA; [DeWeaver, Eric T.] Natl Sci Fdn, Arlington, VA 22230 USA; [Douglas, David C.] US Geol Survey, Alaska Sci Ctr, Juneau, AK 99801 USA; [Marcot, Bruce G.] US Forest Serv, USDA, PNW Res Stn, Portland, OR 97205 USA; [Bitz, Cecilia M.] Univ Washington, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Bailey, David A.] Natl Ctr Atmospher Res, Boulder, CO 80305 USA","Amstrup, SC (reprint author), Polar Bears Int, 810 N Wallace,Suite E,POB 3008, Bozeman, MT 59772 USA.",samstrup@pbears.org,"Daniel, Emily/A-7387-2012; Bitz, Cecilia/S-8423-2016","Bitz, Cecilia/0000-0002-9477-7499; Douglas, David/0000-0003-0186-1104","USGS; USDA Forest Service, Pacific Northwest Research Station; Office of Science (BER), US Department of Energy [ER64735]; National Science Foundation (NSF); NSF Office of Polar Programs [0908675]","Principal funding for this project was provided by the USGS.

Here we describe a specific type of network rewiring event, one that intercalates a new level of transcriptional control into an ancient circuit. We deduce that, over evolutionary time, the direct ancestral connections between a regulator and its target genes were broken and replaced by indirect connections, preserving the overall logic of the ancestral circuit but producing a new behaviour. The example was uncovered through a series of experiments in three ascomycete yeasts: the bakers' yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the dairy yeast Kluyveromyces lactis and the human pathogen Candida albicans. All three species have three cell types: two mating-competent cell forms (a and alpha) and the product of their mating (a/alpha), which is mating-incompetent. In the ancestral mating circuit, two homeodomain proteins, Mata1 and Mat alpha 2, form a heterodimer that directly represses four genes that are expressed only in a and alpha cells and are required for mating(4-6). In a relatively recent ancestor of K. lactis, a reorganization occurred. The Mata1-Mat alpha 2 heterodimer represses the same four genes (known as the core haploid-specific genes) but now does so indirectly through an intermediate regulatory protein, Rme1. The overall logic of the ancestral circuit is preserved (haploid-specific genes ON in a and alpha cells and OFF in a/alpha cells), but a new phenotype was produced by the rewiring: unlike S. cerevisiae and C. albicans, K. lactis integrates nutritional signals, by means of Rme1, into the decision of whether or not to mate.","[Booth, Lauren N.; Tuch, Brian B.; Johnson, Alexander D.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Microbiol & Immunol, San Francisco, CA 94158 USA; [Booth, Lauren N.; Tuch, Brian B.; Johnson, Alexander D.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Biochem & Biophys, San Francisco, CA 94158 USA","Johnson, AD (reprint author), Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Microbiol & Immunol, San Francisco, CA 94158 USA.",ajohnson@cgl.ucsf.edu,,,National Institutes of Health [RO1 GM037049],"We thank Q.

Correlated noise in these inputs can, in principle, have diverse and dramatic effects on the reliability of the resulting computations(1-8). Such theoretical predictions have rarely been tested experimentally because of a scarcity of preparations that permit measurement of both the covariation of a neuron's input signals and the effect on a cell's output of manipulating such covariation. Here we introduce a method to measure covariation of the excitatory and inhibitory inputs a cell receives. This method revealed strong correlated noise in the inputs to two types of retinal ganglion cell. Eliminating correlated noise without changing other input properties substantially decreased the accuracy with which a cell's spike outputs encoded light inputs. Thus, covariation of excitatory and inhibitory inputs can be a critical determinant of the reliability of neural coding and computation.","[Rieke, Fred] Univ Washington, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Cafaro, Jon; Rieke, Fred] Univ Washington, Dept Physiol & Biophys, Seattle, WA 98195 USA","Rieke, F (reprint author), Univ Washington, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.",rieke@u.washington.edu,,,HHMI; NIH [EY-11850],"We thank D.

Pre-clinical studies have demonstrated that the B-RAF(V600E) mutation predicts a dependency on the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signalling cascade in melanoma(2-6)-an observation that has been validated by the success of RAF and MEK inhibitors in clinical trials(7-9). However, clinical responses to targeted anticancer therapeutics are frequently confounded by de novo or acquired resistance(10-12). Identification of resistance mechanisms in a manner that elucidates alternative 'druggable' targets may inform effective long-term treatment strategies(13). Here we expressed similar to 600 kinase and kinase-related open reading frames (ORFs) in parallel to interrogate resistance to a selective RAF kinase inhibitor. We identified MAP3K8 (the gene encoding COT/Tpl2) as a MAPK pathway agonist that drives resistance to RAF inhibition in B-RAF(V600E) cell lines. COT activates ERK primarily through MEK-dependent mechanisms that do not require RAF signalling. Moreover, COT expression is associated with de novo resistance in B-RAF(V600E) cultured cell lines and acquired resistance in melanoma cells and tissue obtained from relapsing patients following treatment with MEK or RAF inhibitors. We further identify combinatorial MAPK pathway inhibition or targeting of COT kinase activity as possible therapeutic strategies for reducing MAPK pathway activation in this setting. Together, these results provide new insights into resistance mechanisms involving the MAPK pathway and articulate an integrative approach through which high-throughput functional screens may inform the development of novel therapeutic strategies.","[Johannessen, Cory M.; Boehm, Jesse S.; Kim, So Young; Thomas, Sapana R.; Johnson, Laura A.; Stransky, Nicolas; Barretina, Jordi; Hieronymus, Haley; Yang, Xiaoping; Alkan, Ozan; Root, David E.; Golub, Todd; Hahn, William C.; Garraway, Levi A.] Harvard & Massachusetts Inst Technol, Broad Inst, Cambridge Ctr 7, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; [Johannessen, Cory M.; Kim, So Young; Thomas, Sapana R.; Wardwell, Leslie; Johnson, Laura A.; Emery, Caroline M.; Barretina, Jordi; Hahn, William C.; Garraway, Levi A.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dana Farber Canc Inst, Dept Med Oncol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Kim, So Young; Murray, Ryan R.; Salehi-Ashtiani, Kourosh; Hill, David E.; Vidal, Marc; Hahn, William C.] Dana Farber Canc Inst, CCSB, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Cogdill, Alexandria P.; Flaherty, Keith T.; Wargo, Jennifer A.] Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Div Surg Oncol Med Oncol & Dermatol, Boston, MA 02114 USA; [Barretina, Jordi; Golub, Todd; Hahn, William C.; Garraway, Levi A.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dana Farber Canc Inst, Ctr Canc Genome Discovery, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Caponigro, Giordano; Wilson, Christopher J.; Myer, Vic E.; Finan, Peter M.; Weber, Barbara L.; Sellers, William R.; Schlegel, Robert] Novartis Inst Biomed Res, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Hieronymus, Haley; Golub, Todd] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dana Farber Canc Inst, Dept Pediat Oncol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Murray, Ryan R.; Salehi-Ashtiani, Kourosh; Hill, David E.; Vidal, Marc; Zhao, Jean J.; Roberts, Thomas M.] Dana Farber Canc Inst, Dept Canc Biol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Murray, Ryan R.; Salehi-Ashtiani, Kourosh; Hill, David E.; Vidal, Marc] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Genet, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Zhao, Jean J.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Pathol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Kim, Sungjoon; Harris, Jennifer L.] Novartis Res Fdn, Genom Inst, San Diego, CA 92121 USA; [Dummer, Reinhard] Univ Zurich Hosp, Dept Dermatol, CH-8091 Zurich, Switzerland","Garraway, LA (reprint author), Harvard & Massachusetts Inst Technol, Broad Inst, Cambridge Ctr 7, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA.",Levi_Garraway@dfci.harvard.edu,"Hill, David/B-6617-2011","Salehi-Ashtiani, Kourosh/0000-0002-6521-5243; Cogdill, Alexandria/0000-0001-8917-9462; Boehm, Jesse/0000-0002-6795-6336","NIH [CA134502]; Novartis Institutes for Biomedical Research; Melanoma Research Alliance; Starr Cancer Consortium; US National Cancer Institute [R33 CA128625, RC2 CA148268]; Swiss National Foundation [310040-103671]; Gottfried and Julia Bangerter Rhyner Stiftung; Ellison Foundation; DFCI Strategic Initiative","We thank members of the Broad Institute/Novartis Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE) for contributing cell line genomic data, expression data and pharmacological cell line sensitivity data; J.

Early clinical experience with a novel class I RAF-selective inhibitor, PLX4032, demonstrated an unprecedented 80% anti-tumour response rate among patients with B-RAF(V600E)-positive melanomas, but acquired drug resistance frequently develops after initial responses(2). Hypotheses for mechanisms of acquired resistance to B-RAF inhibition include secondary mutations in B-RAF(V600E), MAPK reactivation, and activation of alternative survival pathways(3-5). Here we show that acquired resistance to PLX4032 develops by mutually exclusive PDGFR beta (also known as PDGFRB) upregulation or N-RAS (also known as NRAS) mutations but not through secondary mutations in B-RAF(V600E). We used PLX4032-resistant sub-lines artificially derived from B-RAF(V600E)-positive melanoma cell lines and validated key findings in PLX4032-resistant tumours and tumour-matched, short-term cultures from clinical trial patients. Induction of PDGFR beta RNA, protein and tyrosine phosphorylation emerged as a dominant feature of acquired PLX4032 resistance in a subset of melanoma sub-lines, patient-derived biopsies and short-term cultures. PDGFR beta-upregulated tumour cells have low activated RAS levels and, when treated with PLX4032, do not reactivate the MAPK pathway significantly. In another subset, high levels of activated N-RAS resulting from mutations lead to significant MAPK pathway reactivation upon PLX4032 treatment. Knockdown of PDGFR beta or N-RAS reduced growth of the respective PLX4032-resistant subsets. Overexpression of PDGFR beta or N-RAS(Q61K) conferred PLX4032 resistance to PLX4032-sensitive parental cell lines. Importantly, MAPK reactivation predicts MEK inhibitor sensitivity. Thus, melanomas escape B-RAF(V600E) targeting not through secondary B-RAF(V600E) mutations but via receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK)-mediated activation of alternative survival pathway(s) or activated RAS-mediated reactivation of the MAPK pathway, suggesting additional therapeutic strategies.","[Nazarian, Ramin; Shi, Hubing; Wang, Qi; Kong, Xiangju; Lee, Mi-Kyung; Lo, Roger S.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Jonsson Comprehens Canc Ctr, Dept Med, Div Dermatol, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Nazarian, Ramin; Shi, Hubing; Wang, Qi; Kong, Xiangju; Koya, Richard C.; Lee, Hane; Chen, Zugen; Lee, Mi-Kyung; Attar, Narsis; Sazegar, Hooman; Chodon, Thinle; Nelson, Stanley F.; Ribas, Antoni; Lo, Roger S.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, David Geffen Sch Med, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Koya, Richard C.; Ribas, Antoni] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Jonsson Comprehens Canc Ctr, Dept Surg, Div Surg Oncol, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Lee, Hane; Chen, Zugen; Nelson, Stanley F.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Jonsson Comprehens Canc Ctr, Dept Human Genet, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Attar, Narsis; Sazegar, Hooman; Chodon, Thinle; Ribas, Antoni] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Jonsson Comprehens Canc Ctr, Dept Med, Div Hematol & Oncol, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Nelson, Stanley F.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Jonsson Comprehens Canc Ctr, Dept Pediat, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [McArthur, Grant] Peter MacCallum Canc Ctr, Melbourne, Vic 3002, Australia; [Sosman, Jeffrey A.] Vanderbilt Ingram Canc Ctr, Dept Med, Nashville, TN 37232 USA","Lo, RS (reprint author), Univ Calif Los Angeles, Jonsson Comprehens Canc Ctr, Dept Med, Div Dermatol, 52-121 CHS, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.",rlo@mednet.ucla.edu,"Nelson, Stanley/D-4771-2009; Shi, Hubing/B-8445-2014","Shi, Hubing/0000-0002-2926-3440",Dermatology Foundation; Burroughs Wellcome Fund; STOP CANCER Foundation; Margaret E.

Transcription is regulated by various transcription factors. Gre factor homologue 1 (Gfh1), found in the Thermus genus, is a close homologue of the well-conserved bacterial transcription factor GreA, and inhibits transcription initiation and elongation by binding directly to RNAP(1-8). The structural basis of transcription inhibition by Gfh1 has remained elusive, although the crystal structures of RNAP and Gfh1 have been determined separately(6-9). Here we report the crystal structure of Thermus thermophilus RNAP complexed with Gfh1. The amino-terminal coiled-coil domain of Gfh1 fully occludes the channel formed between the two central modules of RNAP; this channel would normally be used for nucleotide triphosphate (NTP) entry into the catalytic site. Furthermore, the tip of the coiled-coil domain occupies the NTP beta-gamma phosphate-binding site. The NTP-entry channel is expanded, because the central modules are 'ratcheted' relative to each other by similar to 7 degrees, as compared with the previously reported elongation complexes. This 'ratcheted state' is an alternative structural state, defined by a newly acquired contact between the central modules. Therefore, the shape of Gfh1 is appropriate to maintain RNAP in the ratcheted state. Simultaneously, the ratcheting expands the nucleic-acid-binding channel, and kinks the bridge helix, which connects the central modules. Taken together, the present results reveal that Gfh1 inhibits transcription by preventing NTP binding and freezing RNAP in the alternative structural state. The ratcheted state might also be associated with other aspects of transcription, such as RNAP translocation and transcription termination.","[Tagami, Shunsuke; Sekine, Shun-ichi; Murayama, Yuko; Kamegamori, Syunsuke; Yokoyama, Shigeyuki] Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Sci, Dept Biophys & Biochem, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo 1130033, Japan; [Tagami, Shunsuke; Sekine, Shun-ichi; Hino, Nobumasa; Murayama, Yuko; Kamegamori, Syunsuke; Sakamoto, Kensaku; Yokoyama, Shigeyuki] RIKEN Syst & Struct Biol Ctr, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2300045, Japan; [Sekine, Shun-ichi; Yokoyama, Shigeyuki] Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Sci, Struct Biol Lab, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo 1130033, Japan; [Kumarevel, Thirumananseri] RIKEN SPring 8 Ctr, Harima Inst, Struct & Mol Biol Lab, Sayo, Hyogo 6795148, Japan; [Yamamoto, Masaki] RIKEN SPring 8 Ctr, Harima Inst, SR Life Sci Instrumentat Unit, Sayo, Hyogo 6795148, Japan","Sekine, S (reprint author), Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Sci, Dept Biophys & Biochem, Bunkyo Ku, 7-3-1 Hongo, Tokyo 1130033, Japan.",sekine@biochem.s.u-tokyo.ac.jp; yokoyama@biochem.s.u-tokyo.ac.jp,"Kumarevel, Thirumananseri/C-6275-2012; Yamamoto, Masaki/B-7844-2015; Tagami, Shunsuke/N-5057-2015; Sakamoto, Kensaku/N-7496-2015; Sekine, Shun-ichi/N-5450-2015; Yokoyama, Shigeyuki/N-6911-2015","Kumarevel, Thirumananseri/0000-0001-9326-6585; Yamamoto, Masaki/0000-0002-1311-1768; Tagami, Shunsuke/0000-0002-1720-3627; Sakamoto, Kensaku/0000-0003-2866-5031; Sekine, Shun-ichi/0000-0001-8174-8704; Yokoyama, Shigeyuki/0000-0003-3133-7338","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS); Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT) of Japan; JSPS Global Centers of Excellence","This work is based on experiments performed at SPring-8 (with the approval of the Japan Synchrotron Radiation Research Institute) and at the Swiss Light Source (SLS).

However, little is known regarding the inevitable collisions that must occur, and the fate of protein obstacles and the mechanisms by which they are evicted from DNA remain unexplored. Here we sought to establish the mechanistic basis for protein displacement from DNA using RecBCD as a model system. Using nanofabricated curtains of DNA and multicolour single-molecule microscopy, we visualized collisions between a model translocase and different DNA-bound proteins in real time. We show that the DNA translocase RecBCD can disrupt core RNA polymerase, holoenzymes, stalled elongation complexes and transcribing RNA polymerases in either head-to-head or head-to-tail orientations, as well as EcoRI(E111Q), lac repressor and even nucleosomes. RecBCD did not pause during collisions and often pushed proteins thousands of base pairs before evicting them from DNA. We conclude that RecBCD overwhelms obstacles through direct transduction of chemomechanical force with no need for specific protein-protein interactions, and that proteins can be removed from DNA through active disruption mechanisms that act on a transition state intermediate as they are pushed from one nonspecific site to the next.","[Greene, Eric C.] Columbia Univ, Howard Hughes Med Inst, New York, NY 10032 USA; [Finkelstein, Ilya J.; Visnapuu, Mari-Liis; Greene, Eric C.] Columbia Univ, Dept Biochem & Mol Biophys, New York, NY 10032 USA","Greene, EC (reprint author), Columbia Univ, Howard Hughes Med Inst, New York, NY 10032 USA.",ecg2108@columbia.edu,,,"NIH [F32GM80864, GM074739, GM082848]; Columbia University; Nanoscale Science and Engineering Initiative of the National Science Foundation [CHE-0641523]; New York State Office of Science, Technology, and Academic Research","We thank M.

Here we report a comprehensive study of the sodium/galactose transporter from Vibrio parahaemolyticus (vSGLT), consisting of molecular dynamics simulations, biochemical characterization and a new crystal structure of the inward-open conformation at a resolution of 2.7 angstrom. Our data show that sodium exit causes a reorientation of transmembrane helix 1 that opens an inner gate required for substrate exit, and also triggers minor rigid-body movements in two sets of transmembrane helical bundles. This cascade of events, initiated by sodium release, ensures proper timing of ion and substrate release. Once set in motion, these molecular changes weaken substrate binding to the transporter and allow galactose readily to enter the intracellular space. Additionally, we identify an allosteric pathway between the sodium-binding sites, the unwound portion of transmembrane helix 1 and the substrate-binding site that is essential in the coupling of co-transport.","[Watanabe, Akira; Chaptal, Vincent; Wright, Ernest M.; Abramson, Jeff] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Physiol, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Choe, Seungho; Rosenberg, John M.; Grabe, Michael] Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Biol Sci, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA; [Rosenberg, John M.; Grabe, Michael] Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Computat & Syst Biol, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA","Abramson, J (reprint author), Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Physiol, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.",mdgrabe@pitt.edu; jabramson@mednet.ucla.edu,"Choe, Seungho/B-1877-2008",,"NIH [GM078844, RGY0069, DK19567]; Human Frontier Science Program","We thank T.

Hyper-reactivity was a rare feature among cysteines and it was found to specify a wide range of activities, including nucleophilic and reductive catalysis and sites of oxidative modification. Hyper-reactive cysteines were identified in several proteins of uncharacterized function, including a residue conserved across eukaryotic phylogeny that we show is required for yeast viability and is involved in iron-sulphur protein biogenesis. We also demonstrate that quantitative reactivity profiling can form the basis for screening and functional assignment of cysteines in computationally designed proteins, where it discriminated catalytically active from inactive cysteine hydrolase designs.","[Weerapana, Eranthie; Wang, Chu; Simon, Gabriel M.; Bachovchin, Daniel A.; Cravatt, Benjamin F.] Scripps Res Inst, Skaggs Inst Chem Biol, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; [Weerapana, Eranthie; Wang, Chu; Simon, Gabriel M.; Dillon, Myles B.

The study of the interplay among these various degrees of freedom in strongly coupled electron-lattice systems is thus crucial to their understanding and for optimizing their properties. Charge-density-wave (CDW) materials(2), with their inherent modulation of the electron density and associated periodic lattice distortion, represent ideal model systems for the study of such highly cooperative phenomena. With femtosecond time-resolved techniques, it is possible to observe these interactions directly by abruptly perturbing the electronic distribution while keeping track of energy relaxation pathways and coupling strengths among the different subsystems(3-7). Numerous time-resolved experiments have been performed on CDWs(8-13), probing the dynamics of the electronic subsystem. However, the dynamics of the periodic lattice distortion have been only indirectly inferred(14). Here we provide direct atomic-level information on the structural dynamics by using femtosecond electron diffraction(15) to study the quasi two-dimensional CDW system 1T-TaS(2). Effectively, we have directly observed the atomic motions that result from the optically induced change in the electronic spatial distribution. The periodic lattice distortion, which has an amplitude of similar to 0.1 angstrom, is suppressed by about 20% on a timescale (similar to 250 femtoseconds) comparable to half the period of the corresponding collective mode. These highly cooperative, electronically driven atomic motions are accompanied by a rapid electron-phonon energy transfer (similar to 350 femtoseconds) and are followed by fast recovery of the CDW (similar to 4 picoseconds). The degree of cooperativity in the observed structural dynamics is remarkable and illustrates the importance of obtaining atomic-level perspectives of the processes directing the physics of strongly correlated systems.","[Moriena, Gustavo; Sciaini, German; Miller, R.

Faster ice flow has been associated with ice-ocean interactions in water-terminating outlet glaciers(2) and with increased surface meltwater supply to the ice-sheet bed inland. Observed correlations between surface melt and ice acceleration(2-6) have raised the possibility of a positive feedback in which surface melting and accelerated dynamic thinning reinforce one another(7), suggesting that overall warming could lead to accelerated mass loss. Here I show that it is not simply mean surface melt(4) but an increase in water input variability(8) that drives faster ice flow. Glacier sliding responds to melt indirectly through changes in basal water pressure(9-11), with observations showing that water under glaciers drains through channels at low pressure or through interconnected cavities at high pressure(12-15). Using a model that captures the dynamic switching(12) between channel and cavity drainage modes, I show that channelization and glacier deceleration rather than acceleration occur above a critical rate of water flow. Higher rates of steady water supply can therefore suppress rather than enhance dynamic thinning(16), indicating that the melt/dynamic thinning feedback is not universally operational. Shortterm increases in water input are, however, accommodated by the drainage system through temporary spikes in water pressure. It is these spikes that lead to ice acceleration, which is therefore driven by strong diurnal melt cycles(4,14) and an increase in rain and surface lake drainage events(8,17,18) rather than an increase in mean melt supply(3,4).","Univ British Columbia, Dept Earth & Ocean Sci, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada","Schoof, C (reprint author), Univ British Columbia, Dept Earth & Ocean Sci, 6339 Stores Rd, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada.",cschoof@eos.ubc.ca,"Schoof, Christian/A-8587-2013",,Canada Research Chairs; NSERC [357193-08]; Canadian Foundation for Climate and Atmospheric Science through the Polar Climate Stability Network,"Thanks to G.

Here we present array-based observations of seismic waves sensitive to this part of the core whose wave speeds require there to be radial compositional variation in the topmost 300 km of the outer core. The velocity profile significantly departs from that of compression of a homogeneous liquid.

This pattern of conservation is thought to reflect a major constraint on the evolution of animal body plans(3). Despite a wealth of morphological data confirming that there is often remarkable divergence in the early and late embryos of species from the same phylum(4-7), it is not yet known to what extent gene expression evolution, which has a central role in the elaboration of different animal forms(8,9), underpins the morphological hourglass pattern. Here we address this question using species-specific microarrays designed from six sequenced Drosophila species separated by up to 40 million years. We quantify divergence at different times during embryogenesis, and show that expression is maximally conserved during the arthropod phylotypic period. By fitting different evolutionary models to each gene, we show that at each time point more than 80% of genes fit best to models incorporating stabilizing selection, and that for genes whose evolutionarily optimal expression level is the same across all species, selective constraint is maximized during the phylotypic period. The genes that conform most to the hourglass pattern are involved in key developmental processes. These results indicate that natural selection acts to conserve patterns of gene expression during mid-embryogenesis, and provide a genome-wide insight into the molecular basis of the hourglass pattern of developmental evolution.","[Kalinka, Alex T.; Varga, Karolina M.; Preibisch, Stephan; Jarrells, Julia; Tomancak, Pavel] Max Planck Inst Mol Cell Biol & Genet, D-01307 Dresden, Germany; [Gerrard, Dave T.; Bergman, Casey M.] Univ Manchester, Fac Life Sci, Manchester M13 9PT, Lancs, England; [Corcoran, David L.; Ohler, Uwe] Duke Univ, Inst Genome Sci & Policy, Durham, NC 27708 USA","Tomancak, P (reprint author), Max Planck Inst Mol Cell Biol & Genet, Pfotenhauerstr 108, D-01307 Dresden, Germany.",tomancak@mpi-cbg.de,"Gerrard, Dave/C-6366-2008; Tomancak, Pavel/C-2109-2009; Bergman, Casey/F-7854-2010","Tomancak, Pavel/0000-0002-2222-9370; Bergman, Casey/0000-0002-5462-9854; Corcoran, David/0000-0001-7460-9247; Gerrard, Dave/0000-0001-6890-7213",Human Frontier Science Program (HFSP) [RGY0084],"We thank A.

Especially elusive is the phylotypic stage, a phase during development where species within a phylum are particularly similar to each other(2-6). Although this has formerly been interpreted as a recapitulation of phylogeny(1), it is now thought to reflect an ontogenetic progression phase(2), where strong constraints on developmental regulation and gene interactions exist(2,3). Several studies have shown that genes expressed during this stage evolve at a slower rate, but it has so far not been possible to derive an unequivocal molecular signature associated with this stage(7-15). Here we use a combination of phylostratigraphy(16) and stage-specific gene expression data to generate a cumulative index that reflects the evolutionary age of the transcriptome at given ontogenetic stages. Using zebrafish ontogeny and adult development as a model, we find that the phylotypic stage does indeed express the oldest transcriptome set and that younger sets are expressed during early and late development, thus faithfully mirroring the hourglass model of morphological divergence(2,3). Reproductively active animals show the youngest transcriptome, with major differences between males and females. Notably, ageing animals express increasingly older genes. Comparisons with similar data sets from flies and nematodes show that this pattern occurs across phyla. Our results indicate that an old transcriptome marks the phylotypic phase and that phylogenetic differences at other ontogenetic stages correlate with the expression of newly evolved genes.","[Domazet-Loso, Tomislav; Tautz, Diethard] Max Planck Inst Evolut Biol, D-24306 Plon, Germany; [Domazet-Loso, Tomislav] Rudjer Boskovic Inst, Div Mol Biol, Lab Evolutionary Genet, Zagreb 10002, Croatia","Domazet-Loso, T (reprint author), Max Planck Inst Evolut Biol, August Thienemannstr 2, D-24306 Plon, Germany.",tdomazet@irb.hr,"Tautz, Diethard/D-4304-2011; Tautz, Diethard/H-8436-2014","Tautz, Diethard/0000-0002-0460-5344",Adris Foundation [49]; Max-Planck Society,"We thank B.

This pathway modulates the behaviour of flagellar motors to propel bacteria towards sources of chemical attractants. Although this system relaxes to a steady state in response to environmental changes, the signalling events within the chemotaxis network are noisy and cause large temporal variations of the motor behaviour even in the absence of stimulus(3). That the same signalling network governs both behavioural variability and cellular response raises the question of whether these two traits are independent. Here, we experimentally establish a fluctuation-response relationship in the chemotaxis system of living bacteria. Using this relationship, we demonstrate the possibility of inferring the cellular response from the behavioural variability measured before stimulus. In monitoring the pre- and post-stimulus switching behaviour of individual bacterial motors, we found that variability scales linearly with the response time for different functioning states of the cell. This study highlights that the fundamental relationship between fluctuation and response is not constrained to physical systems at thermodynamic equilibrium(4) but is extensible to living cells(5). Such a relationship not only implies that behavioural variability and cellular response can be coupled traits, but it also provides a general framework within which we can examine how the selection of a network design shapes this interdependence.","[Guet, Calin C.; Cluzel, Philippe] Harvard Univ, FAS Ctr Syst Biol, Dept Mol & Cellular Biol, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Guet, Calin C.; Cluzel, Philippe] Harvard Univ, Sch Engn & Appl Sci, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Park, Heungwon] Univ Chicago, James Franck Inst, Inst Biophys Dynam, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Park, Heungwon] Univ Chicago, Dept Phys, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Pontius, William; Emonet, Thierry] Yale Univ, Dept Mol Cellular & Dev Biol, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Pontius, William; Emonet, Thierry] Yale Univ, Dept Phys, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Marko, John F.] Northwestern Univ, Dept Mol Biosci, Evanston, IL 60208 USA; [Marko, John F.] Northwestern Univ, Dept Phys & Astron, Evanston, IL 60208 USA","Cluzel, P (reprint author), Harvard Univ, FAS Ctr Syst Biol, Dept Mol & Cellular Biol, 52 Oxford St, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",cluzel@mcb.harvard.edu,,,"NSF DMR [0213745]; NIH [R01AI059195-03, 1U54CA143869-01]; NSF [CCF0829836, PHY-0852130, DMR-0715099]; Alfred P.

The recent demonstration that a population of glioblastoma stem-like cells (GSCs) maintains glioblastomas(1,2) indicates that the progeny of these cells may not be confined to the neural lineage(3). Normal neural stem cells are able to differentiate into functional endothelial cells(4). The connection between neural stem cells and the endothelial compartment seems to be critical in glioblastoma, where cancer stem cells closely interact with the vascular niche and promote angiogenesis through the release of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and stromal-derived factor 1 (refs 5-9). Here we show that a variable number (range 20-90%, mean 60.7%) of endothelial cells in glioblastoma carry the same genomic alteration as tumour cells, indicating that a significant portion of the vascular endothelium has a neoplastic origin. The vascular endothelium contained a subset of tumorigenic cells that produced highly vascularized anaplastic tumours with areas of vasculogenic mimicry in immunocompromised mice. In vitro culture of GSCs in endothelial conditions generated progeny with phenotypic and functional features of endothelial cells. Likewise, orthotopic or subcutaneous injection of GSCs in immunocompromised mice produced tumour xenografts, the vessels of which were primarily composed of human endothelial cells. Selective targeting of endothelial cells generated by GSCs in mouse xenografts resulted in tumour reduction and degeneration, indicating the functional relevance of the GSC-derived endothelial vessels. These findings describe a new mechanism for tumour vasculogenesis and may explain the presence of cancer-derived endothelial-like cells in several malignancies.","[Ricci-Vitiani, Lucia; Biffoni, Mauro; De Maria, Ruggero] Ist Super Sanita, Dept Hematol Oncol & Mol Med, I-00161 Rome, Italy; [Pallini, Roberto; Maira, Giulio] Univ Cattolica Sacro Cuore, Dept Neurosurg, I-00168 Rome, Italy; [Todaro, Matilde; Stassi, Giorgio] Univ Palermo, Dept Surg & Oncol Sci, I-90127 Palermo, Italy; [Invernici, Gloria; Parati, Eugenio Agostino] Neurol Inst Carlo Besta, Fdn IRCCS, UO Cerebrovasc Dis Cellular Neurobiol Lab, I-20133 Milan, Italy; [Cenci, Tonia; Larocca, Luigi Maria] Univ Cattolica Sacro Cuore, Inst Pathol, I-00168 Rome, Italy; [Stassi, Giorgio] Carattere Sci Fdn Salvatore Maugeri, Ist Ricovero & Cura, I-27100 Pavia, Italy; [De Maria, Ruggero] Mediterranean Inst Oncol, I-95029 Catania, Italy","De Maria, R (reprint author), Ist Super Sanita, Dept Hematol Oncol & Mol Med, Viale Regina Elena 299, I-00161 Rome, Italy.",pallini@rm.unicatt.it; demaria@iss.it,"Parati, Eugenio/G-8765-2011; Biffoni, Mauro/J-8318-2016; Ricci Vitiani, Lucia/J-8320-2016; Larocca, Luigi/A-1577-2008","Biffoni, Mauro/0000-0002-1304-9060; Ricci Vitiani, Lucia/0000-0001-7336-5615; Larocca, Luigi/0000-0003-1739-4758; PALLINI, Roberto/0000-0002-4611-8827",Associazione Italiana per la Ricerca sul Cancro,We thank L.

A key feature of GBMs is the extensive network of abnormal vasculature characterized by glomeruloid structures and endothelial hyperplasia(2). Yet the mechanisms of angiogenesis and the origin of tumour endothelial cells remain poorly defined(3-5). Here we demonstrate that a subpopulation of endothelial cells within glioblastomas harbour the same somatic mutations identified within tumour cells, such as amplification of EGFR and chromosome 7. We additionally demonstrate that the stem-cell-like CD133(+) fraction includes a subset of vascular endothelial-cadherin (CD144)-expressing cells that show characteristics of endothelial progenitors capable of maturation into endothelial cells. Extensive in vitro and in vivo lineage analyses, including single cell clonal studies, further show that a subpopulation of the CD133(+) stem-like cell fraction is multipotent and capable of differentiation along tumour and endothelial lineages, possibly via an intermediate CD133(+)/CD144(+) progenitor cell. The findings are supported by genetic studies of specific exons selected from The Cancer Genome Atlas(6), quantitative FISH and comparative genomic hybridization data that demonstrate identical genomic profiles in the CD133(+) tumour cells, their endothelial progenitor derivatives and mature endothelium. Exposure to the clinical anti-angiogenesis agent bevacizumab(7) or to a gamma-secretase inhibitor(8) as well as knockdown shRNA studies demonstrate that blocking VEGF or silencing VEGFR2 inhibits the maturation of tumour endothelial progenitors into endothelium but not the differentiation of CD133(+) cells into endothelial progenitors, whereas c-secretase inhibition or NOTCH1 silencing blocks the transition into endothelial progenitors. These data may provide new perspectives on the mechanisms of failure of anti-angiogenesis inhibitors currently in use. The lineage plasticity and capacity to generate tumour vasculature of the putative cancer stem cells within glioblastoma are novel findings that provide new insight into the biology of gliomas and the definition of cancer stemness, as well as the mechanisms of tumour neo-angiogenesis.","[Wang, Rong; Kowalik, Urszula; Hovinga, Koos E.; Geber, Adam; Fligelman, Boris; Brennan, Cameron; Tabar, Viviane] Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Dept Neurosurg, New York, NY 10065 USA; [Wang, Rong; Tabar, Viviane] Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Ctr Stem Cell Biol, New York, NY 10065 USA; [Wang, Rong; Brennan, Cameron; Tabar, Viviane] Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Brain Tumor Ctr, New York, NY 10065 USA; [Hovinga, Koos E.] Univ Amsterdam, Acad Med Ctr, Neurosurg Ctr Amsterdam, NL-1105 AZ Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Brennan, Cameron] Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Human Oncol & Pathogenesis Program, New York, NY 10065 USA","Tabar, V (reprint author), Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Dept Neurosurg, New York, NY 10065 USA.",tabarv@mskcc.org,,"Brennan, Cameron/0000-0003-4064-8891",New York State Stem Cell Science Fund (NYSTEM),"We would like to thank J.

This asymmetrical phospholipid distribution is disrupted in various biological systems. For example, when blood platelets are activated, they expose phosphatidylserine (PtdSer) to trigger the clotting system(2,3). The PtdSer exposure is believed to be mediated by Ca(2+)-dependent phospholipid scramblases that transport phospholipids bidirectionally(1,4), but its molecular mechanism is still unknown. Here we show that TMEM16F (transmembrane protein 16F) is an essential component for the Ca(2+)-dependent exposure of PtdSer on the cell surface. When a mouse B-cell line, Ba/F3, was treated with a Ca(2+) ionophore under low-Ca(2+) conditions, it reversibly exposed PtdSer. Using this property, we established a Ba/F3 subline that strongly exposed PtdSer by repetitive fluorescence-activated cell sorting. A complementary DNA library was constructed from the subline, and a cDNA that caused Ba/F3 to expose PtdSer spontaneously was identified by expression cloning. The cDNA encoded a constitutively active mutant of TMEM16F, a protein with eight transmembrane segments(5). Wild-type TMEM16F was localized on the plasma membrane and conferred Ca(2+)-dependent scrambling of phospholipids. A patient with Scott syndrome(6,7), which results from a defect in phospholipid scrambling activity(8,9), was found to carry a mutation at a splice-acceptor site of the gene encoding TMEM16F, causing the premature termination of the protein.","[Suzuki, Jun; Nagata, Shigekazu] Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Med, Dept Med Chem, Sakyo Ku, Kyoto 6068501, Japan; [Suzuki, Jun; Nagata, Shigekazu] Japan Sci & Technology Corp, Core Res Evolut Sci & Technol, Kyoto 6068501, Japan; [Umeda, Masato] Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Engn, Dept Synthet Chem & Biol Chem, Nishikyo Ku, Kyoto 6158510, Japan; [Sims, Peter J.] Univ Rochester, Med Ctr, Dept Pathol & Lab Med, Rochester, NY 14642 USA","Nagata, S (reprint author), Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Med, Dept Med Chem, Sakyo Ku, Kyoto 6068501, Japan.",snagata@mfour.med.kyoto-u.ac.jp,,,"Japan Society for the Promotion of Science; National Institutes of Health, USA","We thank T.

The gene encoding TET2 resides at chromosome 4q24, in a region showing recurrent microdeletions and copy-neutral loss of heterozygosity (CN-LOH) in patients with diverse myeloid malignancies(3). Somatic TET2 mutations are frequently observed in myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN), MDS/MPN overlap syndromes including chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia (CMML), acute myeloid leukaemias (AML) and secondary AML (sAML)(4-12). We show here that TET2 mutations associated with myeloid malignancies compromise catalytic activity. Bone marrow samples from patients with TET2 mutations displayed uniformly low levels of 5hmC in genomic DNA compared to bone marrow samples from healthy controls. Moreover, small hairpin RNA (shRNA)-mediated depletion of Tet2 in mouse haematopoietic precursors skewed their differentiation towards monocyte/macrophage lineages in culture. There was no significant difference in DNA methylation between bone marrow samples from patients with high 5hmC versus healthy controls, but samples from patients with low 5hmC showed hypomethylation relative to controls at the majority of differentially methylated CpG sites. Our results demonstrate that Tet2 is important for normal myelopoiesis, and suggest that disruption of TET2 enzymatic activity favours myeloid tumorigenesis. Measurement of 5hmC levels in myeloid malignancies may prove valuable as a diagnostic and prognostic tool, to tailor therapies and assess responses to anticancer drugs.","[Ko, Myunggon; Huang, Yun; Pape, Utz J.; Tahiliani, Mamta; Bandukwala, Hozefa S.; An, Jungeun; Lamperti, Edward D.; Koh, Kian Peng; Rao, Anjana] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Pathol, Immune Dis Inst, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Ko, Myunggon; Huang, Yun; Pape, Utz J.; Tahiliani, Mamta; Bandukwala, Hozefa S.; An, Jungeun; Lamperti, Edward D.; Koh, Kian Peng; Rao, Anjana] Childrens Hosp, Program Cellular & Mol Med, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Jankowska, Anna M.; Ganetzky, Rebecca; Maciejewski, Jaroslaw P.] Cleveland Clin, Taussig Canc Inst, Dept Translat Hematol & Oncol Res, Cleveland, OH 44195 USA; [Jankowska, Anna M.; Ganetzky, Rebecca; Maciejewski, Jaroslaw P.] Cleveland Clin, Dept Hematol Oncol & Blood Disorders, Cleveland, OH 44195 USA; [Pape, Utz J.; Liu, X.

The homodimeric architecture of ClC proteins, initially inferred from single-molecule studies of an elasmobranch Cl(-) channel(2) and later confirmed by crystal structures of bacterial Cl(-)/H(+) antiporters(3,4), is apparently universal. Moreover, the basic machinery that enables ion movement through these proteins-the aqueous pores for anion diffusion in the channels and the ion-coupling chambers that coordinate Cl(-) and H(+) antiport in the transporters-are contained wholly within each subunit of the homodimer. The near-normal function of a bacterial ClC transporter straitjacketed by covalent cross-links across the dimer interface and the behaviour of a concatemeric human homologue argue that the transport cycle resides within each subunit and does not require rigid-body rearrangements between subunits(5,6). However, this evidence is only inferential, and because examples are known in which quaternary rearrangements of extramembrane ClC domains that contribute to dimerization modulate transport activity(7), we cannot declare as definitive a 'parallel-pathways' picture in which the homodimer consists of two singlesubunit transporters operating independently. A strong prediction of such a view is that it should in principle be possible to obtain a monomeric ClC. Here we exploit the known structure of a ClC Cl(-)/H(+) exchanger, ClC-ec1 from Escherichia coli, to design mutants that destabilize the dimer interface while preserving both the structure and the transport function of individual subunits. The results demonstrate that the ClC subunit alone is the basic functional unit for transport and that cross-subunit interaction is not required for Cl(-)/H(+) exchange in ClC transporters.","[Robertson, Janice L.; Kolmakova-Partensky, Ludmila; Miller, Christopher] Brandeis Univ, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Dept Biochem, Waltham, MA 02454 USA","Miller, C (reprint author), Brandeis Univ, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Dept Biochem, Waltham, MA 02454 USA.",cmiller@brandeis.edu,,,"Howard Hughes Medical Institute; NIGMS NIH HHS [R01 GM031768, R37 GM031768]",,,30,50,52,4,28,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,9-Dec,2010,468,7325,,,,,844,847,,10.1038/nature09556,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,691PQ,WOS:000285093700050,21048711,No,,,11/20/17

We studied the Lkb1 tumour suppressor and its substrate AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), kinases that coordinate metabolism with cell growth. Deletion of the Lkb1 (also called Stk11) gene in mice caused increased haematopoietic stem cell (HSC) division, rapid HSC depletion and pancytopenia. HSCs depended more acutely on Lkb1 for cell-cycle regulation and survival than many other haematopoietic cells. HSC depletion did not depend on mTOR activation or oxidative stress. Lkb1-deficient HSCs, but not myeloid progenitors, had reduced mitochondrial membrane potential and ATP levels. HSCs deficient for two catalytic alpha-subunits of AMPK (AMPK-deficient HSCs) showed similar changes in mitochondrial function but remained able to reconstitute irradiated mice. Lkb1-deficient HSCs, but not AMPK-deficient HSCs, exhibited defects in centrosomes and mitotic spindles in culture, and became aneuploid. Lkb1 is therefore required for HSC maintenance through AMPK-dependent and AMPK-independent mechanisms, revealing differences in metabolic and cell-cycle regulation between HSCs and some other haematopoietic progenitors.","[Nakada, Daisuke; Morrison, Sean J.] Univ Michigan, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Inst Life Sci, Ctr Stem Cell Biol, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Nakada, Daisuke; Saunders, Thomas L.; Morrison, Sean J.] Univ Michigan, Dept Internal Med, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA","Morrison, SJ (reprint author), Univ Michigan, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Inst Life Sci, Ctr Stem Cell Biol, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",seanjm@umich.edu,,"Saunders, Thom/0000-0003-2015-101X; Morrison, Sean/0000-0003-1587-8329",Howard Hughes Medical Institute; University of Michigan (UM) Comprehensive Cancer National Institutes of Health (NIH) [CA46592]; Japan Society for the Promotion of Science,"This work was supported by the Howard Hughes Medical Institute.

Although often quiescent in adults, these cells become proliferative upon physiological demand. Balancing HSC energetics in response to nutrient availability and growth state is poorly understood, yet essential for the dynamism of the haematopoietic system. Here we show that the Lkb1 tumour suppressor is critical for the maintenance of energy homeostasis in haematopoietic cells. Lkb1 inactivation in adult mice causes loss of HSC quiescence followed by rapid depletion of all haematopoietic subpopulations. Lkb1-deficient bone marrow cells exhibit mitochondrial defects, alterations in lipid and nucleotide metabolism, and depletion of cellular ATP. The haematopoietic effects are largely independent of Lkb1 regulation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signalling. Instead, these data define a central role for Lkb1 in restricting HSC entry into cell cycle and in broadly maintaining energy homeostasis in haematopoietic cells through a novel metabolic checkpoint.","[Gurumurthy, Sushma; Xie, Stephanie Z.; Alagesan, Brinda; Kim, Judith; Yusuf, Rushdia Z.; Saez, Borja; Tzatsos, Alexandros; Scadden, David T.; Bardeesy, Nabeel] Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Ctr Canc, Boston, MA 02114 USA; [Gurumurthy, Sushma; Xie, Stephanie Z.; Alagesan, Brinda; Kim, Judith; Yusuf, Rushdia Z.; Saez, Borja; Tzatsos, Alexandros; Scadden, David T.; Bardeesy, Nabeel] Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Ctr Regenerat Med, Boston, MA 02114 USA; [Gurumurthy, Sushma; Xie, Stephanie Z.; Alagesan, Brinda; Kim, Judith; Yusuf, Rushdia Z.; Saez, Borja; Tzatsos, Alexandros; Scadden, David T.; Bardeesy, Nabeel] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Boston, MA 02114 USA; [Xie, Stephanie Z.; Yusuf, Rushdia Z.; Saez, Borja; Scadden, David T.] Harvard Univ, Harvard Stem Cell Inst, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Xie, Stephanie Z.; Yusuf, Rushdia Z.; Saez, Borja; Scadden, David T.] Harvard Univ, Dept Stem Cell & Regenerat Biol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Ozsolak, Fatih; Milos, Patrice] Hel BioSci Corp, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Ferrari, Francesco; Park, Peter J.] Childrens Hosp, Ctr Biomed Informat, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Ferrari, Francesco; Park, Peter J.] Childrens Hosp, Informat Program, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Ferrari, Francesco; Park, Peter J.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Shirihai, Orian S.] Boston Univ, Med Ctr, Mitochondria ARC, Evans Res Ctr,Dept Med, Boston, MA 02118 USA","Bardeesy, N (reprint author), Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Ctr Canc, Boston, MA 02114 USA.",Scadden.David@MGH.Harvard.edu; Bardeesy.Nabeel@MGH.Harvard.edu,"Ferrari, Francesco/H-5007-2012","Ferrari, Francesco/0000-0002-9811-3753","NIH [U01 CA141576-01, DK050234]; Ellison Medical Foundation; Massachusetts Biotechnology Research Council","We would like to thank the Harvard Stem Cell Institute Flow Cytometry Core and D.

Here we used antisense morpholino oligonucleotide to U1 snRNA to achieve functional U1 snRNP knockdown in HeLa cells, and identified accumulated unspliced pre-mRNAs by genomic tiling microarrays. In addition to inhibiting splicing, U1 snRNP knockdown caused premature cleavage and polyadenylation in numerous pre-mRNAs at cryptic polyadenylation signals, frequently in introns near (<5 kilobases) the start of the transcript. This did not occur when splicing was inhibited with U2 snRNA antisense morpholino oligonucleotide or the U2-snRNP-inactivating drug spliceostatin A unless U1 antisense morpholino oligonucleotide was also included. We further show that U1 snRNA-pre-mRNA base pairing was required to suppress premature cleavage and polyadenylation from nearby cryptic polyadenylation signals located in introns. These findings reveal a critical splicing-independent function for U1 snRNP in protecting the transcriptome, which we propose explains its overabundance.","[Kaida, Daisuke; Berg, Michael G.; Younis, Ihab; Kasim, Mumtaz; Singh, Larry N.; Wan, Lili; Dreyfuss, Gideon] Univ Penn, Sch Med, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Dept Biochem & Biophys, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA","Dreyfuss, G (reprint author), Univ Penn, Sch Med, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Dept Biochem & Biophys, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",gdreyfuss@hhmi.upenn.edu,"Dreyfuss, Gideon/D-1218-2013","Dreyfuss, Gideon/0000-0001-8129-8774; Kaida, Daisuke/0000-0003-4014-5231",Association Francaise Contre les Myopathies (AFM),"We are grateful to the members of our laboratory, especially J.

For these planets, there is a degeneracy between the mass and composition of both the interior and a possible atmosphere in theoretical models(1,2). The recently discovered transiting super-Earth exoplanet GJ 1214b is one example of this problem(3). Three distinct models for the planet that are consistent with its mass and radius have been suggested(4). Breaking the degeneracy between these models requires obtaining constraints on the planet's atmospheric composition(5,6). Here we report a ground-based measurement of the transmission spectrum of GJ 1214b between wavelengths of 780 and 1,000 nm. The lack of features in this spectrum rules out (at 4.9 sigma confidence) cloud-free atmospheres composed primarily of hydrogen. If the planet's atmosphere is hydrogen-dominated, then it must contain clouds or hazes that are optically thick at the observed wavelengths at pressures less than 200 mbar. Alternatively, the featureless transmission spectrum is also consistent with the presence of a dense, water vapour atmosphere.","[Bean, Jacob L.] Harvard Smithsonian Ctr Astrophys, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Bean, Jacob L.; Homeier, Derek] Univ Gottingen, Inst Astrophys, D-37077 Gottingen, Germany; [Kempton, Eliza Miller-Ricci] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Astron & Astrophys, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA","Bean, JL (reprint author), Harvard Smithsonian Ctr Astrophys, 60 Garden St, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",jbean@cfa.harvard.edu,,"Homeier, Derek/0000-0002-8546-9128",European Commissions; NASA,"We thank D.

Work with high-energy antiparticles is now commonplace, and anti-electrons are used regularly in the medical technique of positron emission tomography scanning. Antihydrogen, the bound state of an antiproton and a positron, has been produced(2,3) at low energies at CERN (the European Organization for Nuclear Research) since 2002. Antihydrogen is of interest for use in a precision test of nature's fundamental symmetries. The charge conjugation/parity/time reversal (CPT) theorem, a crucial part of the foundation of the standard model of elementary particles and interactions, demands that hydrogen and antihydrogen have the same spectrum. Given the current experimental precision of measurements on the hydrogen atom (about two parts in 10(14) for the frequency of the 1s-to-2s transition(4)), subjecting antihydrogen to rigorous spectroscopic examination would constitute a compelling, model-independent test of CPT. Antihydrogen could also be used to study the gravitational behaviour of antimatter(5). However, so far experiments have produced antihydrogen that is not confined, precluding detailed study of its structure. Here we demonstrate trapping of antihydrogen atoms. From the interaction of about 10(7) antiprotons and 7 x 10(8) positrons, we observed 38 annihilation events consistent with the controlled release of trapped antihydrogen from our magnetic trap; the measured background is 1.4 +/- 1.4 events. This result opens the door to precision measurements on anti-atoms, which can soon be subjected to the same techniques as developed for hydrogen.","[Andresen, G. B.; Bowe, P. D.; Hangst, J.

In copper oxides, doping also gives rise to the pseudogap state(6), which can be transformed into a high-temperature superconducting state with sufficient doping or by reducing the temperature. A long-standing issue has been the interplay between the pseudogap, which is generic to all hole-doped copper oxide superconductors, and stripes, whose static form occurs in only one family of copper oxides over a narrow range of the phase diagram(2,7). Here we report observations of the spatial reorganization of electronic states with the onset of the pseudogap state in the high-temperature superconductor Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+x, using spectroscopic mapping with a scanning tunnelling microscope. We find that the onset of the pseudogap phase coincides with the appearance of electronic patterns that have the predicted characteristics of fluctuating stripes(8). As expected, the stripe patterns are strongest when the hole concentration in the CuO2 planes is close to 1/8 (per copper atom)(2-5,8). Although they demonstrate that the fluctuating stripes emerge with the onset of the pseudogap state and occur over a large part of the phase diagram, our experiments indicate that the stripes are a consequence of pseudogap behaviour rather than its cause.","[Parker, Colin V.; Aynajian, Pegor; da Silva Neto, Eduardo H.; Pushp, Aakash; Yazdani, Ali] Princeton Univ, Joseph Henry Labs, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Parker, Colin V.; Aynajian, Pegor; da Silva Neto, Eduardo H.; Pushp, Aakash; Yazdani, Ali] Princeton Univ, Dept Phys, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Ono, Shimpei] Cent Res Inst Elect Power Ind, Tokyo 2018511, Japan; [Wen, Jinsheng; Xu, Zhijun; Gu, Genda] Brookhaven Natl Lab, Upton, NY 11973 USA","Yazdani, A (reprint author), Princeton Univ, Joseph Henry Labs, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA.",yazdani@princeton.edu,"Wen, Jinsheng/F-4209-2010; Pushp, Aakash/G-6626-2011; xu, zhijun/A-3264-2013","Wen, Jinsheng/0000-0001-5864-1466; xu, zhijun/0000-0001-7486-2015",DOE-BES; NSF-DMR; NSF-MRSEC through the Princeton Centre for Complex Materials; W.

As a consequence, the sub-arc mantle wedge is widely believed to be oxidized(3,5). The Fe oxidation state of sub-arc mantle is, however, difficult to determine directly, and debate persists as to whether this oxidation is intrinsic to the mantle source(6,7). Here we show that Zn/Fe(T) (where Fe(T) = Fe(2+) + Fe(3+)) is redox-sensitive and retains a memory of the valence state of Fe in primary arc basalts and their mantle sources. During melting of mantle peridotite, Fe(2+) and Zn behave similarly, but because Fe(3+) is more incompatible than Fe(2+), melts generated in oxidized environments have low Zn/Fe(T). Primitive arc magmas have identical Zn/Fe(T) to mid-ocean-ridge basalts, suggesting that primary mantle melts in arcs and ridges have similar Fe oxidation states. The constancy of Zn/Fe(T) during early differentiation involving olivine requires that Fe(3+)/Fe(T) remains low in the magma. Only after progressive fractionation does Fe(3+)/Fe(T) increase and stabilize magnetite as a fractionating phase. These results suggest that subduction of oxidized crustal material may not significantly alter the redox state of the mantle wedge. Thus, the higher oxidation states of arc lavas must be in part a consequence of shallow-level differentiation processes, though such processes remain poorly understood.","[Lee, Cin-Ty A.; Luffi, Peter; Le Roux, Veronique; Dasgupta, Rajdeep; Albarede, Francis; Leeman, William P.] Rice Univ, Dept Earth Sci, Houston, TX 77005 USA; [Albarede, Francis] Univ Lyon 1, Ecole Normale Super Lyon, F-69007 Lyon, France; [Albarede, Francis] CNRS, F-69007 Lyon, France; [Leeman, William P.] Natl Sci Fdn, Div Earth Sci, Arlington, VA 22230 USA","Lee, CTA (reprint author), Rice Univ, Dept Earth Sci, Houston, TX 77005 USA.",ctlee@rice.edu,"Lee, Cin-Ty/A-5469-2008; Le Roux, Veronique/C-4633-2011; Dasgupta, Rajdeep/C-7252-2009; Luffi, Peter/C-1229-2013; Albarede, Francis/A-8871-2011","Dasgupta, Rajdeep/0000-0001-5392-415X; Albarede, Francis/0000-0003-1994-1428; Le Roux, Veronique/0000-0002-5855-4888",Geological Society of America,"Discussions and debates with D.

Despite the numerical simplicity of the fly nervous system, features of the anatomical organization of the fly brain often confound the delineation of these circuits. Here we identify a neural circuit responsive to cVA, a pheromone that elicits sexually dimorphic behaviours(1-4). We have combined neural tracing using an improved photoactivatable green fluorescent protein (PA-GFP) with electrophysiology, optical imaging and laser-mediated microlesioning to map this circuit from the activation of sensory neurons in the antennae to the excitation of descending neurons in the ventral nerve cord. This circuit is concise and minimally comprises four neurons, connected by three synapses. Three of these neurons are overtly dimorphic and identify a male-specific neuropil that integrates inputs from multiple sensory systems and sends outputs to the ventral nerve cord. This neural pathway suggests a means by which a single pheromone can elicit different behaviours in the two sexes.","[Ruta, Vanessa; Datta, Sandeep Robert; Vasconcelos, Maria Luisa; Freeland, Jessica; Axel, Richard] Columbia Univ Coll Phys & Surg, Dept Biochem & Mol Biophys, New York, NY 10032 USA; [Ruta, Vanessa; Datta, Sandeep Robert; Vasconcelos, Maria Luisa; Freeland, Jessica; Axel, Richard] Columbia Univ Coll Phys & Surg, Howard Hughes Med Inst, New York, NY 10032 USA; [Looger, Loren L.] Howard Hughes Med Inst, Ashburn, VA 20147 USA","Axel, R (reprint author), Columbia Univ Coll Phys & Surg, Dept Biochem & Mol Biophys, New York, NY 10032 USA.",ra27@columbia.edu,,"Vasconcelos, Maria Luisa/0000-0001-6248-3667",Foundation for the National Institutes of Health through the Grand Challenges in Global Health Initiative; Helen Hay Whitney Foundation; Burroughs Welcome Fund; Howard Hughes Medical Institute,"We thank T.

How acidity is sensed and translated into an appropriate behavioural response is poorly understood. Here we describe a functionally segregated population of olfactory sensory neurons in the fruitfly, Drosophila melanogaster, that are highly selective for acidity. These olfactory sensory neurons express IR64a, a member of the recently identified ionotropic receptor (IR) family of putative olfactory receptors(2). In vivo calcium imaging showed that IR64a+ neurons projecting to the DC4 glomerulus in the antennal lobe are specifically activated by acids. Flies in which the function of IR64a+ neurons or the IR64a gene is disrupted had defects in acid-evoked physiological and behavioural responses, but their responses to non-acidic odorants remained unaffected. Furthermore, artificial stimulation of IR64a+ neurons elicited avoidance responses. Taken together, these results identify cellular and molecular substrates for acid detection in the Drosophila olfactory system and support a labelled-line mode of acidity coding at the periphery.","[Ai, Minrong; Min, Soohong; Leblanc, Charlotte; Suh, Greg S.

Mitochondrial oxidant stress is widely viewed as being responsible for this loss(2), but why these particular neurons should be stressed is a mystery. Here we show, using transgenic mice that expressed a redox-sensitive variant of green fluorescent protein targeted to the mitochondrial matrix, that the engagement of plasma membrane L-type calcium channels during normal autonomous pacemaking created an oxidant stress that was specific to vulnerable SNc dopaminergic neurons. The oxidant stress engaged defences that induced transient, mild mitochondrial depolarization or uncoupling. The mild uncoupling was not affected by deletion of cyclophilin D, which is a component of the permeability transition pore, but was attenuated by genipin and purine nucleotides, which are antagonists of cloned uncoupling proteins. Knocking out DJ-1 (also known as PARK7 in humans and Park7 in mice), which is a gene associated with an early-onset form of Parkinson's disease, downregulated the expression of two uncoupling proteins (UCP4 (SLC25A27) and UCP5 (SLC25A14)), compromised calcium-induced uncoupling and increased oxidation of matrix proteins specifically in SNc dopaminergic neurons. Because drugs approved for human use can antagonize calcium entry through L-type channels, these results point to a novel neuroprotective strategy for both idiopathic and familial forms of Parkinson's disease.","[Guzman, Jaime N.; Sanchez-Padilla, Javier; Wokosin, David; Ilijic, Ema; Surmeier, D.

How energy metabolism and stem-cell homeostatic processes are coordinated is not well understood. Lkb1 acts as an evolutionarily conserved regulator of cellular energy metabolism in eukaryotic cells and functions as the major upstream kinase to phosphorylate AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and 12 other AMPK-related kinases(1-3). Whether Lkb1 regulates stem-cell maintenance remains unknown. Here we show that Lkb1 has an essential role in haematopoietic stem cell (HSC) homeostasis. We demonstrate that ablation of Lkb1 in adult mice results in severe pancytopenia and subsequent lethality. Loss of Lkb1 leads to impaired survival and escape from quiescence of HSCs, resulting in exhaustion of the HSC pool and a marked reduction of HSC repopulating potential in vivo. Lkb1 deletion has an impact on cell proliferation in HSCs, but not on more committed compartments, pointing to context-specific functions for Lkb1 in haematopoiesis. The adverse impact of Lkb1 deletion on haematopoiesis was predominantly cell-autonomous and mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1)-independent, and involves multiple mechanisms converging on mitochondrial apoptosis and possibly downregulation of PGC-1 coactivators and their transcriptional network, which have critical roles in mitochondrial biogenesis and function. Thus, Lkb1 serves as an essential regulator of HSCs and haematopoiesis, and more generally, points to the critical importance of coupling energy metabolism and stem-cell homeostasis.","[Gan, Boyi; Hu, Jian; Jiang, Shan; Liu, Yingchun; Sahin, Erguen; Zhuang, Li; Fletcher-Sananikone, Eliot; Colla, Simona; Wang, Y.

Entry of virus into host cells by endocytosis is controlled by two envelope glycoproteins, E1 and E2. The E2-E1 heterodimers form 80 trimeric spikes on the icosahedral virus surface(1,2), 60 with quasi-three-fold symmetry and 20 coincident with the icosahedral three-fold axes arranged with T 54 quasi-symmetry. The E1 glycoprotein has a hydrophobic fusion loop at one end and is responsible for membrane fusion(3,4). The E2 protein is responsible for receptor binding(5,6) and protects the fusion loop at neutral pH. The lower pH in the endosome induces the virions to undergo an irreversible conformational change in which E2 and E1 dissociate and E1 forms homotrimers, triggering fusion of the viral membrane with the endosomal membrane and then releasing the viral genome into the cytoplasm(3,4). Here we report the structure of an alphavirus spike, crystallized at low pH, representing an intermediate in the fusion process and clarifying the maturation process. The trimer of E2-E1 in the crystal structure is similar to the spikes in the neutral pH virus except that the E2 middle region is disordered, exposing the fusion loop. The amino-and carboxy-terminal domains of E2 each form immunoglobulin-like folds, consistent with the receptor attachment properties of E2.","[Li, Long; Jose, Joyce; Xiang, Ye; Kuhn, Richard J.; Rossmann, Michael G.] Purdue Univ, Dept Biol Sci, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA","Rossmann, MG (reprint author), Purdue Univ, Dept Biol Sci, 915 W State St, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA.",mr@purdue.edu,"Li, Long/F-8892-2010",,NIH [P01 AI055672],"We wish to thank S.

CHIKV invasion of susceptible cells is mediated by two viral glycoproteins, E1 and E2, which carry the main antigenic determinants and form an icosahedral shell at the virion surface. Glycoprotein E2, derived from furin cleavage of the p62 precursor into E3 and E2, is responsible for receptor binding, and E1 for membrane fusion. In the context of a concerted multidisciplinary effort to understand the biology of CHIKV2, here we report the crystal structures of the precursor p62-E1 heterodimer and of the mature E3-E2-E1 glycoprotein complexes. The resulting atomic models allow the synthesis of a wealth of genetic, biochemical, immunological and electron microscopy data accumulated over the years on alphaviruses in general. This combination yields a detailed picture of the functional architecture of the 25 MDa alphavirus surface glycoprotein shell. Together with the accompanying report on the structure of the Sindbis virus E2-E1 heterodimer at acidic pH (ref. 3), this work also provides new insight into the acid-triggered conformational change on the virus particle and its inbuilt inhibition mechanism in the immature complex.","[Voss, James E.; Vaney, Marie-Christine; Duquerroy, Stephane; Rey, Felix A.] Inst Pasteur, Dept Virol, Unite Virol Struct, F-75724 Paris 15, France; [Voss, James E.; Vaney, Marie-Christine; Duquerroy, Stephane; Rey, Felix A.] CNRS, URA 3015, F-75724 Paris 15, France; [Duquerroy, Stephane] Univ Paris 11, Fac Orsay, F-91405 Orsay, France; [Vonrhein, Clemens; Bricogne, Gerard] Global Phasing Ltd, Cambridge CB3 0AX, England; [Girard-Blanc, Christine; Crublet, Elodie] Inst Pasteur, Dept Biol Struct & Chim, F-75724 Paris 15, France; [Girard-Blanc, Christine; Crublet, Elodie] CNRS, URA 2185, F-75724 Paris 15, France; [Thompson, Andrew] Synchrotron SOLEIL, F-91192 Gif Sur Yvette, France","Rey, FA (reprint author), Inst Pasteur, Dept Virol, Unite Virol Struct, 25 Rue Dr Roux, F-75724 Paris 15, France.",rey@pasteur.fr,"Rey, Felix/B-6497-2012","Rey, Felix/0000-0002-9953-7988; Duquerroy, Stephane/0000-0003-4386-8013",European Union Research Traning Network; French 'Agence Nationale de la Recherche'; Merck-Serono; Pediatric Dengue Vaccine Initiative; Institut Pasteur [PTR201 CHIKV],"We thank the CHIKV task force at Institut Pasteur, in particular the group of F.

The translocation reaction is catalysed by elongation factor G (EF-G) in a GTP-dependent manner(3). Despite the availability of structures of various EF-G-ribosome complexes, the precise mechanism by which tRNAs move through the ribosome still remains unclear. Here we use multiparticle cryoelectron microscopy analysis to resolve two previously unseen subpopulations within Thermus thermophilus EF-G-ribosome complexes at subnanometre resolution, one of them with a partly translocated tRNA. Comparison of these substates reveals that translocation of tRNA on the 30S subunit parallels the swivelling of the 30S head and is coupled to unratcheting of the 30S body. Because the tRNA maintains contact with the peptidyl-tRNA-binding site (P site) on the 30S head and simultaneously establishes interaction with the exit site (E site) on the 30S platform, a novel intra-subunit 'pe/E' hybrid state is formed. This state is stabilized by domain IV of EF-G, which interacts with the swivelled 30S-head conformation. These findings provide direct structural and mechanistic insight into the 'missing link' in terms of tRNA intermediates involved in the universally conserved translocation process.","[Ratje, Andreas H.; Loerke, Justus; Bruenner, Matthias; Hildebrand, Peter W.; Mielke, Thorsten; Spahn, Christian M.

Here we demonstrate the ability to generate progenitors and mature cells of the haematopoietic fate directly from human dermal fibroblasts without establishing pluripotency. Ectopic expression of OCT4 (also called POU5F1)-activated haematopoietic transcription factors, together with specific cytokine treatment, allowed generation of cells expressing the pan-leukocyte marker CD45. These unique fibroblast-derived cells gave rise to granulocytic, monocytic, megakaryocytic and erythroid lineages, and demonstrated in vivo engraftment capacity. We note that adult haematopoietic programs are activated, consistent with bypassing the pluripotent state to generate blood fate: this is distinct from haematopoiesis involving pluripotent stem cells, where embryonic programs are activated. These findings demonstrate restoration of multipotency from human fibroblasts, and suggest an alternative approach to cellular reprogramming for autologous cell-replacement therapies that avoids complications associated with the use of human pluripotent stem cells.","[Szabo, Eva; Rampalli, Shravanti; Risueno, Ruth M.; Schnerch, Angelique; Mitchell, Ryan; Fiebig-Comyn, Aline; Levadoux-Martin, Marilyne; Bhatia, Mickie] McMaster Univ, Stem Cell & Canc Res Inst, Hamilton, ON L8N 3Z5, Canada; [Schnerch, Angelique; Mitchell, Ryan; Bhatia, Mickie] McMaster Univ, Dept Biochem & Biomed Sci, Hamilton, ON L8N 3Z5, Canada","Bhatia, M (reprint author), McMaster Univ, Stem Cell & Canc Res Inst, Hamilton, ON L8N 3Z5, Canada.",mbhatia@mcmaster.ca,"Munoz Risueno, Ruth/G-9969-2015","Munoz Risueno, Ruth/0000-0003-4048-9536",Canadian Institute of Health Research (CIHR); Canadian Cancer Society Research Institute (CCS-RI); StemCell Network; Ontario Ministry of Research Innovation (MRI); Canadian Chair; Ministry of Research and Innovation (MRI); MITACS; Ontario Graduate Scholarship (OGS),"This work was supported by grants to M.B. from the Canadian Institute of Health Research (CIHR), the Canadian Cancer Society Research Institute (CCS-RI), the StemCell Network and the Ontario Ministry of Research Innovation (MRI).

Despite broad biological importance, the identity of sugar efflux transporters has remained elusive. Using optical glucose sensors, we identified a new class of sugar transporters, named SWEETs, and show that at least six out of seventeen Arabidopsis, two out of over twenty rice and two out of seven homologues in Caenorhabditis elegans, and the single copy human protein, mediate glucose transport. Arabidopsis SWEET8 is essential for pollen viability, and the rice homologues SWEET11 and SWEET14 are specifically exploited by bacterial pathogens for virulence by means of direct binding of a bacterial effector to the SWEET promoter. Bacterial symbionts and fungal and bacterial pathogens induce the expression of different SWEET genes, indicating that the sugar efflux function of SWEET transporters is probably targeted by pathogens and symbionts for nutritional gain. The metazoan homologues may be involved in sugar efflux from intestinal, liver, epididymis and mammary cells.","[Chen, Li-Qing; Hou, Bi-Huei; Lalonde, Sylvie; Takanaga, Hitomi; Hartung, Mara L.; Qu, Xiao-Qing; Guo, Woei-Jiun; Chaudhuri, Bhavna; Chermak, Diane; Frommer, Wolf B.] Carnegie Inst Sci, Dept Plant Biol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Kim, Jung-Gun; Mudgett, Mary Beth] Stanford Univ, Dept Biol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Antony, Ginny; White, Frank F.] Kansas State Univ, Dept Plant Pathol, Manhattan, KS 66506 USA; [Underwood, William; Somerville, Shauna C.] Energy Biosci Inst, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA","Frommer, WB (reprint author), Carnegie Inst Sci, Dept Plant Biol, 290 Panama St, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",wfrommer@carnegiescience.edu,"Frommer, Wolf/K-5042-2017; Frommer, Wolf B/A-8256-2008; GUO, WOEI-JIUN/F-8487-2012","Frommer, Wolf/0000-0001-6465-0115; Underwood, William/0000-0002-9920-8228; ","Department of Energy [DE-FG02-04ER15542]; NIH (NIDDK) [1RO1DK079109]; Carnegie Institution; National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [30771288]; NSF [IOS-0821801]; NIH [ZRO1GM06886-06A1, F32GM083439-02]; NSF; USDA NIFA [2007-35319-18103]; NSF Plant Genome [DBI-0820831]","This work was made possible by grants from the Department of Energy (DE-FG02-04ER15542) and NIH (NIDDK; 1RO1DK079109) to W.B.F., X.-Q.Q. was supported by The Carnegie Institution and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC; 30771288).

The WRC is inactive towards the Arp2/3 complex, but can be stimulated by the Rac GTPase, kinases and phosphatidylinositols. Here we report the 2.3-angstrom crystal structure of the WRC and complementary mechanistic analyses. The structure shows that the activity-bearing VCA motif of WAVE is sequestered by a combination of intramolecular and intermolecular contacts within the WRC. Rac and kinases appear to destabilize a WRC element that is necessary for VCA sequestration, suggesting the way in which these signals stimulate WRC activity towards the Arp2/3 complex. The spatial proximity of the Rac binding site and the large basic surface of the WRC suggests how the GTPase and phospholipids could cooperatively recruit the complex to membranes.","[Chen, Zhucheng; Borek, Dominika; Padrick, Shae B.; Metlagel, Zoltan; Ismail, Ayman M.; Umetani, Junko; Otwinowski, Zbyszek; Rosen, Michael K.] Univ Texas SW Med Ctr Dallas, Dept Biochem, Dallas, TX 75390 USA; [Chen, Zhucheng; Padrick, Shae B.; Metlagel, Zoltan; Ismail, Ayman M.; Umetani, Junko; Rosen, Michael K.] Univ Texas SW Med Ctr Dallas, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Dallas, TX 75390 USA; [Gomez, Timothy S.; Billadeau, Daniel D.] Mayo Clin, Coll Med, Schulze Ctr Novel Therapeut, Div Oncol Res, Rochester, MN 55905 USA","Rosen, MK (reprint author), Univ Texas SW Med Ctr Dallas, Dept Biochem, 5323 Harry Hines Blvd, Dallas, TX 75390 USA.",michael.rosen@utsouthwestern.edu,"Borek, Dominika/D-2943-2011; Otwinowski, Zbyszek/F-3665-2011","Borek, Dominika/0000-0002-4321-6253; Padrick, Shae/0000-0002-6916-6194","Cancer Research Institute; NIH [1F32-GM06917902, R01-AI065474, R01-GM053163, R01-GM056322]; Allergic Diseases Training grant [AI07047]; Welch Foundation [I-1544]; Howard Hughes Medical Institute; US DOE [DE-AC02-06CH11357]","We thank B.

There is a purely geometric test of the expansion of the Universe (the Alcock-Paczynski test), which would provide an independent way of investigating the abundance (Omega(X)) and equation of state (w(X)) of dark energy(5). It is based on an analysis of the geometrical distortions expected from comparing the real-space and redshift-space shape of distant cosmic structures, but it has proved difficult to implement(6-18). Here we report an analysis of the symmetry properties of distant pairs of galaxies from archival data(19,20). This allows us to determine that the Universe is flat. By alternately fixing its spatial geometry at Omega(k) equivalent to 0, and the dark energy equation-of-state parameter at w(X) equivalent to -1, and using the results of baryon acoustic oscillations, we can establish at the 68.3% confidence level that -0.85 > w(X) > - 1.12 and 0.60 < Omega(X) < 0.80.","[Marinoni, Christian; Buzzi, Adeline] Univ Aix Marseille 1, CNRS, UMR 6207, Ctr Phys Theor, F-13288 Marseille 9, France; [Marinoni, Christian] Inst Univ France, F-75005 Paris, France","Marinoni, C (reprint author), Univ Aix Marseille 1, CNRS, UMR 6207, Ctr Phys Theor, Campus Luminy,Case 907, F-13288 Marseille 9, France.",marinoni@cpt.univ-mrs.fr,,,CNRS; Institut Universitaire de France,"M. thanks J.

Such pulsational masses are found to be smaller than the masses derived from stellar evolution theory: this is the Cepheid mass discrepancy problem(1,2), for which a solution is missing(3-5). An independent, accurate dynamical mass determination for a classical Cepheid variable star (as opposed to type-II Cepheids, low-mass stars with a very different evolutionary history) in a binary system is needed in order to determine which is correct. The accuracy of previous efforts to establish a dynamical Cepheid mass from Galactic single-lined non-eclipsing binaries was typically about 15-30% (refs 6, 7), which is not good enough to resolve the mass discrepancy problem. In spite of many observational efforts(8,9), no firm detection of a classical Cepheid in an eclipsing double-lined binary has hitherto been reported. Here we report the discovery of a classical Cepheid in a well detached, double-lined eclipsing binary in the Large Magellanic Cloud. We determine the mass to a precision of 1% and show that it agrees with its pulsation mass, providing strong evidence that pulsation theory correctly and precisely predicts the masses of classical Cepheids.","[Pietrzynski, G.; Gieren, W.; Graczyk, D.; Pilecki, B.] Univ Concepcion, Dept Astron, Concepcion, Chile; [Pietrzynski, G.; Udalski, A.; Soszynski, I.; Pilecki, B.] Uniwersytetu Warszawskiego, Obserwatorium Astron, PL-00478 Warsaw, Poland; [Thompson, I.

However, the most omnipresent Bose gas, blackbody radiation (radiation in thermal equilibrium with the cavity walls) does not show this phase transition. In such systems photons have a vanishing chemical potential, meaning that their number is not conserved when the temperature of the photon gas is varied(10); at low temperatures, photons disappear in the cavity walls instead of occupying the cavity ground state. Theoretical works have considered thermalization processes that conserve photon number (a prerequisite for BEC), involving Compton scattering with a gas of thermal electrons(11) or photon-photon scattering in a nonlinear resonator configuration(12,13). Number-conserving thermalization was experimentally observed(14) for a two-dimensional photon gas in a dye-filled optical microcavity, which acts as a 'white-wall' box. Here we report the observation of a Bose-Einstein condensate of photons in this system. The cavity mirrors provide both a confining potential and a nonvanishing effective photon mass, making the system formally equivalent to a two-dimensional gas of trapped, massive bosons. The photons thermalize to the temperature of the dye solution (room temperature) by multiple scattering with the dye molecules. Upon increasing the photon density, we observe the following BEC signatures: the photon energies have a Bose-Einstein distribution with a massively populated ground-state mode on top of a broad thermal wing; the phase transition occurs at the expected photon density and exhibits the predicted dependence on cavity geometry; and the ground-state mode emerges even for a spatially displaced pump spot. The prospects of the observed effects include studies of extremely weakly interacting low-dimensional Bose gases(9) and new coherent ultraviolet sources(15).","[Klaers, Jan; Schmitt, Julian; Vewinger, Frank; Weitz, Martin] Univ Bonn, Inst Angew Phys, D-53115 Bonn, Germany","Weitz, M (reprint author), Univ Bonn, Inst Angew Phys, Wegelerstr 8, D-53115 Bonn, Germany.",martin.weitz@uni-bonn.de,"Klaers, Jan/N-9793-2016","Klaers, Jan/0000-0001-5939-7477; Vewinger, Frank/0000-0001-7818-2981; Schmitt, Julian/0000-0002-0002-3777",Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft within the focused research unit [FOR557]; IFRAF at LKB Paris,"We thank J.

Previous studies have shown that biodiversity has positive effects on organisms and processes(4) across trophic levels(5). However, only a few studies have so far incorporated an explicit food-web perspective(6). In an eight-year biodiversity experiment, we studied an unprecedented range of above-and below-ground organisms and multitrophic interactions. A multitrophic data set originating from a single long-term experiment allows mechanistic insights that would not be gained from meta-analysis of different experiments. Here we show that plant diversity effects dampen with increasing trophic level and degree of omnivory. This was true both for abundance and species richness of organisms. Furthermore, we present comprehensive above-ground/below-ground biodiversity food webs. Both above ground and below ground, herbivores responded more strongly to changes in plant diversity than did carnivores or omnivores. Density and richness of carnivorous taxa was independent of vegetation structure. Below-ground responses to plant diversity were consistently weaker than above-ground responses. Responses to increasing plant diversity were generally positive, but were negative for biological invasion, pathogen infestation and hyperparasitism. Our results suggest that plant diversity has strong bottom-up effects on multitrophic interaction networks, with particularly strong effects on lower trophic levels. Effects on higher trophic levels are indirectly mediated through bottom-up trophic cascades.","[Scherber, Christoph; Ebeling, Anne; Tscharntke, Teja] Univ Gottingen, Dept Crop Sci, D-37077 Gottingen, Germany; [Scherber, Christoph; Weisser, Wolfgang W.; Voigt, Winfried; Roscher, Christiane; Weigelt, Alexandra; Allan, Eric; Clement, Lars W.; Ebeling, Anne; Halle, Stefan; Kertscher, Ilona; Klein, Alexandra-Maria; Kowalski, Esther; Lange, Markus; Lauterbach, Dirk; Mueller, Ramona] Univ Jena, Inst Ecol, D-07743 Jena, Germany; [Eisenhauer, Nico; Partsch, Stephan; Sabais, Alexander; Scheu, Stefan] Univ Gottingen, JF Blumenbach Inst Zool & Anthropol, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany; [Eisenhauer, Nico] Univ Minnesota, Dept Forest Resources, St Paul, MN 55108 USA; [Schmid, Bernhard; Petermann, Jana S.] Univ Zurich, Inst Environm Sci, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland; [Fischer, Markus] Univ Bern, CH-3013 Bern, Switzerland; [Fischer, Markus; Kummer, Volker; Rottstock, Tanja] Univ Potsdam, Inst Biochem & Biol, D-14469 Potsdam, Germany; [Schulze, Ernst-Detlef; Middelhoff, Cornelius; Schumacher, Jens; Temperton, Vicky M.] Max Planck Inst Biogeochem, D-07745 Jena, Germany; [Roscher, Christiane] UFZ Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Dept Community Ecol, D-06120 Halle, Germany; [Weigelt, Alexandra] Univ Leipzig, Inst Biol 1, D-04103 Leipzig, Germany; [Bessler, Holger; Engels, Christof] Humboldt Univ, Dept Plant Nutr, D-14195 Berlin, Germany; [Bonkowski, Michael; Koller, Robert] Univ Cologne, Cologne Bioctr, Dept Terr Ecol, D-50674 Cologne, Germany; [Buchmann, Nina] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Inst Plant Anim & Agroecosyst Sci, LFW C56, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland; [Buscot, Francois; Koenig, Stephan] UFZ Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Dept Soil Ecol, D-06102 Halle, Germany; [Klein, Alexandra-Maria] Leuphana Univ Lueneburg, Inst Ecol & Environm Chem, D-21335 Luneburg, Germany; [Kuu, Annely] Tallinn Univ Technol, Tartu Coll, EE-51008 Tartu, Estonia; [Migunova, Varvara D.] KI Skryabin All Russian Inst Helminthol, Moscow 117218, Russia; [Milcu, Alexandru] Imperial Coll London, Div Biol, NERC Ctr Populat Biol, Ascot SL5 7PY, Berks, England; [Petermann, Jana S.] Univ British Columbia, Dept Zool, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada; [Renker, Carsten] Mainz Museum Nat Hist, D-55116 Mainz, Germany; [Schumacher, Jens] Univ Jena, Inst Stochast, D-07743 Jena, Germany; [Temperton, Vicky M.] Forschungszentrum Julich GmbH, Phytosphere Inst ICG 3, D-52425 Julich, Germany","Scherber, C (reprint author), Univ Gottingen, Dept Crop Sci, Grisebachstr 6, D-37077 Gottingen, Germany.",christoph.scherber@agr.uni-goettingen.de,"; Schulze, Ernst-Detlef/K-9627-2014; Tscharntke, Teja/N-5123-2014; Bonkowski, Michael/C-3700-2013; Buscot, Francois /A-4125-2016; Fischer, Markus/C-6411-2008; Schmid, Bernhard/C-8625-2009; Scherber, Christoph/B-6611-2009; Milcu, Alexandru/D-6099-2011; Buchmann, Nina/E-6095-2011; Eisenhauer, Nico/I-5932-2012; Petermann, Jana/E-2130-2013; Weisser, Wolfgang/B-9718-2014","Milcu, Alexandru/0000-0002-2889-1234; Scherber, Christoph/0000-0001-7924-8911; Eisenhauer, Nico/0000-0002-0371-6720; Kolller, Robert/0000-0001-7251-7242; Bonkowski, Michael/0000-0003-2656-1183; Buscot, Francois /0000-0002-2364-0006; Fischer, Markus/0000-0002-5589-5900; Schmid, Bernhard/0000-0002-8430-3214; Petermann, Jana/0000-0002-3898-5656; Weisser, Wolfgang/0000-0002-2757-8959",Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft [FOR 456],"We thank J.

The main physical barrier is found in the CNS endothelial cell, and depends on continuous complexes of tight junctions combined with reduced vesicular transport(2). Other possible constituents of the BBB include extracellular matrix, astrocytes and pericytes(3), but the relative contribution of these different components to the BBB remains largely unknown(1,3). Here we demonstrate a direct role of pericytes at the BBB in vivo. Using a set of adult viable pericyte-deficient mouse mutants we show that pericyte deficiency increases the permeability of the BBB to water and a range of low-molecular-mass and high-molecular-mass tracers. The increased permeability occurs by endothelial transcytosis, a process that is rapidly arrested by the drug imatinib. Furthermore, we show that pericytes function at the BBB in at least two ways: by regulating BBB-specific gene expression patterns in endothelial cells, and by inducing polarization of astrocyte end-feet surrounding CNS blood vessels. Our results indicate a novel and critical role for pericytes in the integration of endothelial and astrocyte functions at the neurovascular unit, and in the regulation of the BBB.","[Armulik, Annika; Genove, Guillem; Mae, Maarja; Nisancioglu, Maya H.; Wallgard, Elisabet; Niaudet, Colin; He, Liqun; Norlin, Jenny; Strittmatter, Karin; Betsholtz, Christer] Karolinska Inst, Dept Med Biochem & Biophys, Div Vasc Biol, SE-17177 Stockholm, Sweden; [Lindblom, Per] AstraZeneca AB, Clin Dev, SE-43183 Molndal, Sweden; [Johansson, Bengt R.] Univ Gothenburg, Sahlgrenska Acad, Inst Biomed, Electron Microscopy Unit, SE-40530 Gothenburg, Sweden","Betsholtz, C (reprint author), Karolinska Inst, Dept Med Biochem & Biophys, Div Vasc Biol, Scheelesvag 2, SE-17177 Stockholm, Sweden.",annika.armulik@ki.se; christer.betsholtz@ki.se,"Genove, Guillem/F-1158-2011","Genove, Guillem/0000-0002-8558-3107; Keller, Annika/0000-0003-1466-3633","Leducq Foundation; Swedish Governmental Agency for Innovation Systems (Vinnova); EU; Swedish Cancer Society and Research Council; Knut and Alice Wallenberg, Inga-Britt and Arne Lundberg, and Torsten and Ragnar Soderberg Foundations","We thank U.

This blood-brain barrier (BBB) is crucial to ensure proper neuronal function and protect the CNS from injury and disease(1). Transplantation studies have demonstrated that the BBB is not intrinsic to the endothelial cells, but is induced by interactions with the neural cells(2). Owing to the close spatial relationship between astrocytes and endothelial cells, it has been hypothesized that astrocytes induce this critical barrier postnatally(3), but the timing of BBB formation has been controversial(4-9). Here we demonstrate that the barrier is formed during embryogenesis as endothelial cells invade the CNS and pericytes are recruited to the nascent vessels, over a week before astrocyte generation. Analysing mice with null and hypomorphic alleles of Pdgfrb, which have defects in pericyte generation, we demonstrate that pericytes are necessary for the formation of the BBB, and that absolute pericyte coverage determines relative vascular permeability. We demonstrate that pericytes regulate functional aspects of the BBB, including the formation of tight junctions and vesicle trafficking in CNS endothelial cells. Pericytes do not induce BBB-specific gene expression in CNS endothelial cells, but inhibit the expression of molecules that increase vascular permeability and CNS immune cell infiltration. These data indicate that pericyte-endothelial cell interactions are critical to regulate the BBB during development, and disruption of these interactions may lead to BBB dysfunction and neuroinflammation during CNS injury and disease.","[Daneman, Richard; Kebede, Amanuel A.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Anat, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; [Zhou, Lu; Barres, Ben A.] Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Dept Neurobiol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA","Daneman, R (reprint author), Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Anat, 513 Parnassus Ave,HSW1301, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA.",Richard.daneman@ucsf.edu,,,NINDS [R01-NS045621]; Myelin Repair Foundation; NMSS [RG3936A7]; UCSF; AHA,"We thank J.

Deregulation of the Ras pathway is a frequent hallmark of NSCLC, often through mutations that directly activate Kras(2). p53 is also frequently inactivated in NSCLC and, because oncogenic Ras can be a potent trigger of p53 (ref. 3), it seems likely that oncogenic Ras signalling has a major and persistent role in driving the selection against p53. Hence, pharmacological restoration of p53 is an appealing therapeutic strategy for treating this disease(4). Here we model the probable therapeutic impact of p53 restoration in a spontaneously evolving mouse model of NSCLC initiated by sporadic oncogenic activation of endogenous Kras(5). Surprisingly, p53 restoration failed to induce significant regression of established tumours, although it did result in a significant decrease in the relative proportion of high-grade tumours. This is due to selective activation of p53 only in the more aggressive tumour cells within each tumour. Such selective activation of p53 correlates with marked upregulation in Ras signal intensity and induction of the oncogenic signalling sensor p19(ARF) (ref. 6). Our data indicate that p53-mediated tumour suppression is triggered only when oncogenic Ras signal flux exceeds a critical threshold. Importantly, the failure of low-level oncogenic Kras to engage p53 reveals inherent limits in the capacity of p53 to restrain early tumour evolution and in the efficacy of therapeutic p53 restoration to eradicate cancers.","[Junttila, Melissa R.; Karnezis, Anthony N.; Garcia, Daniel; Kortlever, Roderik M.; Rostker, Fanya; Swigart, Lamorna Brown; Evan, Gerard I.; Martins, Carla P.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Pathol, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; [Junttila, Melissa R.; Karnezis, Anthony N.; Garcia, Daniel; Kortlever, Roderik M.; Rostker, Fanya; Swigart, Lamorna Brown; Pham, David M.; Seo, Youngho; Evan, Gerard I.; Martins, Carla P.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Helen Diller Family Comprehens Canc Ctr, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; [Madriles, Francesc] Li Ka Shing Ctr, Canc Res UK Cambridge Res Inst, Cambridge CB2 0RE, England; [Pham, David M.; Seo, Youngho] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Radiol & Biomed Imaging, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA","Evan, GI (reprint author), Univ Cambridge, Dept Biochem, Tennis Court Rd, Cambridge CB2 1GA, England.",gie20@cam.ac.uk,,,"NCI [CA98018, CA100193]; AICR [09-0649]; Ellison Medical Foundation; Samuel R.

Personalized cancer therapy that is based on targeting these underlying genetic abnormalities presupposes that sustained inactivation of tumour suppressors and activation of oncogenes is essential in advanced cancers. Mutations in the p53 tumour-suppressor pathway are common in human cancer and significant efforts towards pharmaceutical reactivation of defective p53 pathways are underway(1-3). Here we show that restoration of p53 in established murine lung tumours leads to significant but incomplete tumour cell loss specifically in malignant adenocarcinomas, but not in adenomas. We define amplification of MAPK signalling as a critical determinant of malignant progression and also a stimulator of Arf tumour-suppressor expression. The response to p53 restoration in this context is critically dependent on the expression of Arf. We propose that p53 not only limits malignant progression by suppressing the acquisition of alterations that lead to tumour progression, but also, in the context of p53 restoration, responds to increased oncogenic signalling to mediate tumour regression. Our observations also underscore that the p53 pathway is not engaged by low levels of oncogene activity that are sufficient for early stages of lung tumour development. These data suggest that restoration of pathways important in tumour progression, as opposed to initiation, may lead to incomplete tumour regression due to the stage-heterogeneity of tumour cell populations.","[Feldser, David M.; Kostova, Kamena K.; Winslow, Monte M.; Taylor, Sarah E.; Cashman, Chris; Whittaker, Charles A.; Sanchez-Rivera, Francisco J.; Resnick, Rebecca; Hemann, Michael T.; Jacks, Tyler] MIT, Dept Biol, Koch Inst Integrat Canc Res, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Feldser, David M.; Kostova, Kamena K.; Winslow, Monte M.; Taylor, Sarah E.; Cashman, Chris; Whittaker, Charles A.; Sanchez-Rivera, Francisco J.; Resnick, Rebecca; Hemann, Michael T.; Jacks, Tyler] MIT, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Bronson, Roderick] Tufts Univ, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Bronson, Roderick] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Boston, MA 02115 USA","Jacks, T (reprint author), MIT, Dept Biol, Koch Inst Integrat Canc Res, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",tjacks@mit.edu,,"Sanchez-Rivera, Francisco J./0000-0002-8466-8563",National Cancer Institute [P30-CA14051]; American Cancer Society; MIT; Howard Hughes Medical Institute,"We would like to thank M.

Accurate segregation depends on selective stabilization of correct 'bi-oriented' kinetochore-microtubule attachments, which come under tension as the result of opposing forces exerted by microtubules(3). Tension is thought to stabilize these bi-oriented attachments indirectly, by suppressing the destabilizing activity of a kinase, Aurora B(4,5). However, a complete mechanistic understanding of the role of tension requires reconstitution of kinetochore-microtubule attachments for biochemical and biophysical analyses in vitro. Here we show that native kinetochore particles retaining the majority of kinetochore proteins can be purified from budding yeast and used to reconstitute dynamic microtubule attachments. Individual kinetochore particles maintain load-bearing associations with assembling and disassembling ends of single microtubules for >30 min, providing a close match to the persistent coupling seen in vivo between budding yeast kinetochores and single microtubules(6). Moreover, tension increases the lifetimes of the reconstituted attachments directly, through a catch bond-like mechanism that does not require Aurora B(7-10). On the basis of these findings, we propose that tension selectively stabilizes proper kinetochore-microtubule attachments in vivo through a combination of direct mechanical stabilization and tension-dependent phosphoregulation.","[Akiyoshi, Bungo; Nelson, Christian R.; Arellano-Santoyo, Hugo; Biggins, Sue] Fred Hutchinson Canc Res Ctr, Div Basic Sci, Seattle, WA 98109 USA; [Akiyoshi, Bungo; Arellano-Santoyo, Hugo] Univ Washington, Mol & Cellular Biol Program, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Sarangapani, Krishna K.; Powers, Andrew F.; Arellano-Santoyo, Hugo; Asbury, Charles L.] Univ Washington, Dept Physiol Biophys, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Reichow, Steve L.; Gonen, Tamir] Univ Washington, Dept Biochem, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Gonen, Tamir] Univ Washington, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Ranish, Jeffrey A.] Inst Syst Biol, Seattle, WA 98103 USA","Biggins, S (reprint author), Fred Hutchinson Canc Res Ctr, Div Basic Sci, Seattle, WA 98109 USA.",casbury@u.washington.edu; sbiggins@fhcrc.org,,"Akiyoshi, Bungo/0000-0001-6010-394X","NSF IGERT [DGE-0504573]; NIH [T32GM07270, T32HL007312, GM078069, GM064386]; NCI Cancer Center [CA015704]; NIGMS [PM50 GM076547, R01GM79373]; Searle Scholar Award [06-L-111]; Packard Fellowship for Science and Engineering [2006-30521]","We thank A.

Focal adhesions consist of a complex network(4) of trans-plasma-membrane integrins and cytoplasmic proteins that form a <200-nm plaque(5,6) linking the ECM to the actin cytoskeleton. The complexity of focal adhesion composition and dynamics implicate an intricate molecular machine(7,8). However, focal adhesion molecular architecture remains unknown. Here we used three-dimensional super-resolution fluorescence microscopy (interferometric photo-activated localization microscopy)(9) to map nanoscale protein organization in focal adhesions. Our results reveal that integrins and actin are vertically separated by a similar to 40-nm focal adhesion core region consisting of multiple protein-specific strata: a membrane-apposed integrin signalling layer containing integrin cytoplasmic tails, focal adhesion kinase and paxillin; an intermediate force-transduction layer containing talin and vinculin; and an uppermost actin-regulatory layer containing zyxin, vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein and alpha-actinin.

Ryanodine receptors (RyRs) are ion channels that govern the release of Ca2+ from the endoplasmic and sarcoplasmic reticulum(1). Mutations in RyRs can lead to severe genetic conditions that affect both cardiac and skeletal muscle, but locating the mutated residues in the full-length channel structure has been difficult(2,3). Here we show the 2.5 angstrom resolution crystal structure of a region spanning three domains of RyR type 1 (RyR1), encompassing amino acid residues 1-559. The domains interact with each other through a predominantly hydrophilic interface. Docking in RyR1 electron microscopy maps(4,5) unambiguously places the domains in the cytoplasmic portion of the channel, forming a 240-kDa cytoplasmic vestibule around the four-fold symmetry axis. We pinpoint the exact locations of more than 50 disease-associated mutations in full-length RyR1 and RyR2. The mutations can be classified into three groups: those that destabilize the interfaces between the three amino-terminal domains, disturb the folding of individual domains or affect one of six interfaces with other parts of the receptor. We propose a model whereby the opening of a RyR coincides with allosterically coupled motions within the N-terminal domains. This process can be affected by mutations that target various interfaces within and across subunits. The crystal structure provides a framework to understand the many disease-associated mutations in RyRs that have been studied using functional methods, and will be useful for developing new strategies to modulate RyR function in disease states.","[Tung, Ching-Chieh; Lobo, Paolo A.; Kimlicka, Lynn; Van Petegem, Filip] Univ British Columbia, Dept Biochem & Mol Biol, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z3, Canada","Van Petegem, F (reprint author), Univ British Columbia, Dept Biochem & Mol Biol, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z3, Canada.",filip.vanpetegem@gmail.com,"Van Petegem, Filip/M-6061-2016","Van Petegem, Filip/0000-0003-2728-8537",Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR); Heart and Stroke Foundation of Canada,"We thank the staff at beamline 08ID-1 of the Canadian Light source, the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Lightsource, K.

To distinguish between two possible classes of models of neural sequence generation, we carried out intracellular recordings of HVC neurons in singing zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata). We found that the subthreshold membrane potential is characterized by a large, rapid depolarization 5-10 ms before burst onset, consistent with a synaptically connected chain of neurons in HVC. We found no evidence for the slow membrane potential modulation predicted by models in which burst timing is controlled by subthreshold dynamics. Furthermore, bursts ride on an underlying depolarization of similar to 10-ms duration, probably the result of a regenerative calcium spike within HVC neurons that could facilitate the propagation of activity through a chain network with high temporal precision. Our results provide insight into the fundamental mechanisms by which neural circuits can generate complex sequential behaviours.","[Long, Michael A.; Fee, Michale S.] MIT, Dept Brain & Cognit Sci, McGovern Inst Brain Res, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Jin, Dezhe Z.] Penn State Univ, Dept Phys, University Pk, PA 16802 USA","Fee, MS (reprint author), MIT, Dept Brain & Cognit Sci, McGovern Inst Brain Res, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",fee@mit.edu,,"Fee, Michale/0000-0001-7539-1745","National Institutes of Health [MH067105, DC009280]; Alfred P.

The F-box protein CORONATINE INSENSITIVE 1 (COI1) mediates jasmonate signalling by promoting hormone-dependent ubiquitylation and degradation of transcriptional repressor JAZ proteins. Despite its importance, the mechanism of jasmonate perception remains unclear. Here we present structural and pharmacological data to show that the true Arabidopsis jasmonate receptor is a complex of both COI1 and JAZ. COI1 contains an open pocket that recognizes the bioactive hormone (3R, 7S)-jasmonoyl-L-isoleucine (JA-Ile) with high specificity. High-affinity hormone binding requires a bipartite JAZ degron sequence consisting of a conserved a-helix for COI1 docking and a loop region to trap the hormone in its binding pocket. In addition, we identify a third critical component of the jasmonate co-receptor complex, inositol pentakisphosphate, which interacts with both COI1 and JAZ adjacent to the ligand. Our results unravel the mechanism of jasmonate perception and highlight the ability of F-box proteins to evolve as multi-component signalling hubs.","[Sheard, Laura B.; Tan, Xu; Mao, Haibin; Hinds, Thomas R.; Zheng, Ning] Univ Washington, Dept Pharmacol, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Withers, John; He, Sheng Yang; Howe, Gregg A.] Michigan State Univ, Dept Energy, Plant Res Lab, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Withers, John; He, Sheng Yang] Michigan State Univ, Dept Plant Biol, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Ben-Nissan, Gili; Sharon, Michal] Weizmann Inst Sci, Dept Biol Chem, IL-76100 Rehovot, Israel; [Kobayashi, Yuichi] Tokyo Inst Technol, Dept Biol Engn, Midori Ku, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2268501, Japan; [Hsu, Fong-Fu] Washington Univ, Sch Med, Dept Internal Med, Div Endocrinol Diabet Metab & Lipid Res, St Louis, MO 63110 USA; [Browse, John] Washington State Univ, Inst Biol Chem, Pullman, WA 99164 USA; [Rizo, Josep] Univ Texas SW Med Ctr Dallas, Dept Biochem, Dallas, TX 75390 USA; [Howe, Gregg A.] Michigan State Univ, Dept Biochem & Mol Biol, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Zheng, Ning] Univ Washington, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Seattle, WA 98195 USA","Zheng, N (reprint author), Univ Washington, Dept Pharmacol, Box 357280, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.",nzheng@u.washington.edu,"Tan, Xu/E-7170-2011; Mao, Haibin/B-7609-2011","Browse, John/0000-0002-2554-2821; Sharon, Michal/0000-0003-3933-0595","Howard Hughes Medical Institute; National Institutes of Health [R01 CA107134, T32 GM07270, R01GM57795, R01AI068718]; National Science Foundation [0929100]; US Department of Energy [DE-FG02-99ER20323, DE-FG02-91ER20021]; Michigan State University; Welch Foundation [I-1304]; European Research Council (ERC) under the European Community [239679]","We thank the beamline staff of the Advanced Light Source at the University of California at Berkeley and the Advanced Photon Source at Argonne National Laboratory for help with data collection.

Here we present crystal structures of the recently discovered Bacillus cereus AlkD glycosylase in complex with DNAs containing alkylated, mismatched and abasic nucleotides. Unlike other glycosylases, AlkD captures the extrahelical lesion in a solvent-exposed orientation, providing an illustration for how hydrolysis of N3- and N7-alkylated bases may be facilitated by increased lifetime out of the DNA helix. The structures and supporting biochemical analysis of base flipping and catalysis reveal how the HEAT repeats of AlkD distort the DNA backbone to detect non-Watson-Crick base pairs without duplex intercalation.","[Rubinson, Emily H.; Eichman, Brandt F.] Vanderbilt Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Nashville, TN 37232 USA; [Rubinson, Emily H.; Eichman, Brandt F.] Vanderbilt Univ, Struct Biol Ctr, Nashville, TN 37232 USA; [Gowda, A.

For example, a quantum network can serve as a 'web' for connecting quantum processors for computation(2,3) and communication(4), or as a 'simulator' allowing investigations of quantum critical phenomena arising from interactions among the nodes mediated by the channels(5,6). The physical realization of quantum networks generically requires dynamical systems capable of generating and storing entangled states among multiple quantum memories, and efficiently transferring stored entanglement into quantum channels for distribution across the network. Although such capabilities have been demonstrated for diverse bipartite systems(7-12), entangled states have not been achieved for interconnects capable of 'mapping' multipartite entanglement stored in quantum memories to quantum channels. Here we demonstrate measurement-induced entanglement stored in four atomic memories; user-controlled, coherent transfer of the atomic entanglement to four photonic channels; and characterization of the full quadripartite entanglement using quantum uncertainty relations(13-16). Our work therefore constitutes an advance in the distribution of multipartite entanglement across quantum networks. We also show that our entanglement verification method is suitable for studying the entanglement order of condensed-matter systems in thermal equilibrium(17,18).","[Choi, K. S.; Goban, A.; Papp, S.

An appealing next step is the extension of such a capability to the field of information storage, by taking advantage of the magnetic bistability and rich quantum behaviour of single-molecule magnets(3-6) (SMMs). Recently, a proof of concept that the magnetic memory effect is retained when SMMs are chemically anchored to a metallic surface(7) was provided. However, control of the nanoscale organization of these complex systems is required for SMMs to be integrated into molecular spintronic devices(8,9). Here we show that a preferential orientation of Fe(4) complexes on a gold surface can be achieved by chemical tailoring. As a result, the most striking quantum feature of SMMs-their stepped hysteresis loop, which results from resonant quantum tunnelling of the magnetization(5,6)-can be clearly detected using synchrotron-based spectroscopic techniques. With the aid of multiple theoretical approaches, we relate the angular dependence of the quantum tunnelling resonances to the adsorption geometry, and demonstrate that molecules predominantly lie with their easy axes close to the surface normal. Our findings prove that the quantum spin dynamics can be observed in SMMs chemically grafted to surfaces, and offer a tool to reveal the organization of matter at the nanoscale.","[Mannini, M.; Pineider, F.; Totti, F.; Sorace, L.; Sessoli, R.] Univ Florence, Dept Chem Ugo Schiff, I-50019 Sesto Fiorentino, Italy; [Mannini, M.; Pineider, F.; Totti, F.; Sorace, L.; Sessoli, R.] Univ Florence, INSTM Res Unit, I-50019 Sesto Fiorentino, Italy; [Mannini, M.] Univ Florence, ISTM CNR, URT Firenze, I-50019 Sesto Fiorentino, Italy; [Danieli, C.; Cornia, A.] Univ Modena & Reggio Emilia, Dept Chem, I-41100 Modena, Italy; [Danieli, C.; Cornia, A.] Univ Modena & Reggio Emilia, INSTM Res Unit, I-41100 Modena, Italy; [Sainctavit, Ph.; Arrio, M. -A.] Univ Paris 06, CNRS, UMR7590, Inst Mineral & Phys Milieux Condenses, F-75252 Paris, France; [Otero, E.] Synchrotron Soleil, F-91192 Gif Sur Yvette, France; [Joly, L.] Paul Scherrer Inst, Swiss Light Source, CH-5232 Villigen, Switzerland; [Cezar, J.

Introducing chirality into porous inorganic solids may produce new types of materials that could be useful for chiral separation, stereospecific catalysis, chiral recognition (sensing) and photonic materials(2-5). Template synthesis of inorganic solids using the self-assembly of lyotropic liquid crystals offers access to materials with well-defined porous structures(6-12), but only recently has chirality been introduced into hexagonal mesostructures through the use of a chiral surfactant(13,14). Efforts to impart chirality at a larger length scale using self-assembly are almost unknown. Here we describe the development of a photonic mesoporous inorganic solid that is a cast of a chiral nematic liquid crystal formed from nanocrystalline cellulose. These materials may be obtained as free-standing films with high surface area. The peak reflected wavelength of the films can be varied across the entire visible spectrum and into the near-infrared through simple changes in the synthetic conditions. To the best of our knowledge these are the first materials to combine mesoporosity with long-range chiral ordering that produces photonic properties. Our findings could lead to the development of new materials for applications in, for example, tuneable reflective filters and sensors. In addition, this type of material could be used as a hard template to generate other new materials with chiral nematic structures.","[Shopsowitz, Kevin E.; Qi, Hao; MacLachlan, Mark J.] Univ British Columbia, Dept Chem, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z1, Canada; [Hamad, Wadood Y.] FPInnovations, Vancouver, BC V6S 2L9, Canada","MacLachlan, MJ (reprint author), Univ British Columbia, Dept Chem, 2036 Main Mall, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z1, Canada.",mmaclach@chem.ubc.ca,"Shopsowitz, Kevin/A-2915-2013; MacLachlan, Mark/I-2961-2013","MacLachlan, Mark/0000-0002-3546-7132",Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC) of Canada; FPInnovations; UBC,This work was supported by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC) of Canada and FPInnovations.

During such eruptions, rapid deflation occurs as magma flows out and pressure is reduced(1-3). Less is known about the deformation style at moderately active volcanoes, such as Eyjafjallajokull, Iceland, where an explosive summit eruption of trachyandesite beginning on 14 April 2010 caused exceptional disruption to air traffic, closing airspace over much of Europe for days. This eruption was preceded by an effusive flank eruption of basalt from 20 March to 12 April 2010. The 2010 eruptions are the culmination of 18 years of intermittent volcanic unrest(4-9). Here we show that deformation associated with the eruptions was unusual because it did not relate to pressure changes within a single magma chamber. Deformation was rapid before the first eruption (>5 mm per day after 4 March), but negligible during it. Lack of distinct co-eruptive deflation indicates that the net volume of magma drained from shallow depth during this eruption was small; rather, magma flowed from considerable depth. Before the eruption, a similar to 0.05 km(3) magmatic intrusion grew over a period of three months, in a temporally and spatially complex manner, as revealed by GPS (Global Positioning System) geodetic measurements and interferometric analysis of satellite radar images. The second eruption occurred within the ice-capped caldera of the volcano, with explosivity amplified by magma-ice interaction. Gradual contraction of a source, distinct from the pre-eruptive inflation sources, is evident from geodetic data. Eyjafjallajokull's behaviour can be attributed to its off-rift setting with a 'cold' subsurface structure and limited magma at shallow depth, as may be typical for moderately active volcanoes. Clear signs of volcanic unrest signals over years to weeks may indicate reawakening of such volcanoes, whereas immediate short-term eruption precursors may be subtle and difficult to detect.","[Sigmundsson, Freysteinn; Hreinsdottir, Sigrun; Arnadottir, Thora; Pedersen, Rikke; Oskarsson, Niels; Auriac, Amandine; Decriem, Judicael; Einarsson, Pall; Hensch, Martin; Ofeigsson, Benedikt G.] Univ Iceland, Inst Earth Sci, Nord Volcanol Ctr, IS-101 Reykjavik, Iceland; [Hooper, Andrew] Delft Univ Technol, Delft Inst Earth Observat & Space Syst, NL-2629 HS Delft, Netherlands; [Roberts, Matthew J.; Geirsson, Halldor; Sveinbjornsson, Hjorleifur] Iceland Meteorol Off, IS-150 Reykjavik, Iceland; [Sturkell, Erik] Univ Gothenburg, Dept Earth Sci, SE-40530 Gothenburg, Sweden; [Feigl, Kurt L.] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Geosci, Madison, WI 53706 USA","Sigmundsson, F (reprint author), Univ Iceland, Inst Earth Sci, Nord Volcanol Ctr, Sturlugata 7, IS-101 Reykjavik, Iceland.",fs@hi.is,"Hooper, Andrew/A-9614-2008; Arnadottir, Thora/C-7183-2013; Pedersen, Rikke/C-8584-2013; Sigmundsson, Freysteinn/F-7160-2015","Arnadottir, Thora/0000-0002-8275-8813; Sigmundsson, Freysteinn/0000-0001-9052-4665; Feigl, Kurt/0000-0002-2059-6708",University of Iceland; US National Science Foundation [EAR 1042103]; Icelandic government,"We acknowledge the efforts of Th.

The most widely adopted marine indicator is mean trophic level (MTL) from catches, intended to detect shifts from high-trophic-level predators to low-trophic-level invertebrates and plankton-feeders(3-5). This indicator underpins reported trends in human impacts, declining when predators collapse (""fishing down marine food webs'')(3) and when low-trophic-level fisheries expand (""fishing through marine food webs'')(6). The assumption is that catch MTL measures changes in ecosystem MTL and biodiversity(2,5). Here we combine model predictions with global assessments of MTL from catches, trawl surveys and fisheries stock assessments(7) and find that catch MTL does not reliably predict changes in marine ecosystems. Instead, catch MTL trends often diverge from ecosystem MTL trends obtained from surveys and assessments. In contrast to previous findings of rapid declines in catch MTL3, we observe recent increases in catch, survey and assessment MTL. However, catches from most trophic levels are rising, which can intensify fishery collapses even when MTL trends are stable or increasing. To detect fishing impacts on marine biodiversity, we recommend greater efforts to measure true abundance trends for marine species, especially those most vulnerable to fishing.","[Branch, Trevor A.; McGilliard, Carey R.] Univ Washington, Sch Aquat & Fishery Sci, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Watson, Reg; Pablico, Grace T.] Univ British Columbia, Fisheries Ctr, Sea Around Us Project, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada; [Fulton, Elizabeth A.] CSIRO Wealth Oceans, Hobart, Tas 7001, Australia; [Jennings, Simon] Ctr Environm Fisheries & Aquaculture Sci, Lowestoft NR33 0HT, Suffolk, England; [Jennings, Simon] Univ E Anglia, Sch Environm Sci, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England; [Ricard, Daniel] Dalhousie Univ, Dept Biol, Halifax, NS B3H 4J1, Canada; [Tracey, Sean R.] Univ Tasmania, Tasmanian Aquaculture & Fisheries Inst, Marine Res Labs, Hobart, Tas 7001, Australia","Branch, TA (reprint author), Univ Washington, Sch Aquat & Fishery Sci, Box 355020, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.",tbranch@uw.edu,"Fulton, Elizabeth/A-2871-2008; Branch, Trevor/A-5691-2009; Jennings, Simon/F-5085-2012; Watson, Reg/F-4850-2012; Ricard, Daniel/G-1814-2014","Fulton, Elizabeth/0000-0002-5904-7917; Jennings, Simon/0000-0002-2390-7225; Watson, Reg/0000-0001-7201-8865; ","University of California Santa Barbara; US National Science Foundation (NSF); Moore Foundation; School of Aquatic and Fishery Sciences, University of Washington; Canadian Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council; Canadian Foundation for Innovation; Pew Charitable Trusts","This work arose out of a working group at the National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis (NCEAS), funded by the University of California Santa Barbara, the US National Science Foundation (NSF), and the Moore Foundation.

In vertebrates, sex can be determined by inherited genetic factors or by the temperature experienced during embryonic development(2,3). However, the evolutionary causes of this diversity remain unknown. Here we show that live-bearing lizards at different climatic extremes of the species' distribution differ in their sex-determining mechanisms, with temperature-dependent sex determination in lowlands and genotypic sex determination in highlands. A theoretical model parameterized with field data accurately predicts this divergence in sex-determining systems and the consequence thereof for variation in cohort sex ratios among years. Furthermore, we show that divergent natural selection on sex determination across altitudes is caused by climatic effects on lizard life history and variation in the magnitude of between-year temperature fluctuations. Our results establish an adaptive explanation for intra-specific divergence in sex-determining systems driven by phenotypic plasticity and ecological selection, thereby providing a unifying framework for integrating the developmental, ecological and evolutionary basis for variation in vertebrate sex determination.","[Pen, Ido; Feldmeyer, Barbara; Harts, Anna] Univ Groningen, Theoret Biol Grp, NL-9750 AA Haren, Netherlands; [Uller, Tobias] Univ Oxford, Dept Zool, Edward Grey Inst, Oxford OX1 3PS, England; [While, Geoffrey M.; Wapstra, Erik] Univ Tasmania, Sch Zool, Hobart, Tas 7001, Australia","Pen, I (reprint author), Univ Groningen, Theoret Biol Grp, POB 14, NL-9750 AA Haren, Netherlands.",i.r.pen@rug.nl,"Feldmeyer, Barbara/F-9652-2013; Feldmeyer, Barbara/E-5067-2015; Wapstra, Erik/J-7482-2014; While, Geoffrey/O-6306-2017","Wapstra, Erik/0000-0002-2050-8026; While, Geoffrey/0000-0001-8122-9322",Australian Research Council [DP0877948]; Hermon Slade Foundation; Wenner-Gren Foundations,"Funding was provided by the Australian Research Council to E.W., T.U. and I.P.

A new form of intercellular communication, contact-dependent growth inhibition (CDI), was discovered recently in Escherichia coli(2). CDI is mediated by the CdiB/CdiA two-partner secretion (TPS) system. CdiB facilitates secretion of the CdiA 'exoprotein' onto the cell surface. An additional small immunity protein (CdiI) protects CDI+ cells from autoinhibition(2,3). The mechanisms by which CDI blocks cell growth and by which CdiI counteracts this growth arrest are unknown. Moreover, the existence of CDI activity in other bacteria has not been explored. Here we show that the CDI growth inhibitory activity resides within the carboxy-terminal region of CdiA (CdiA-CT), and that CdiI binds and inactivates cognate CdiA-CT, but not heterologous CdiA-CT. Bioinformatic and experimental analyses show that multiple bacterial species encode functional CDI systems with high sequence variability in the CdiA-CT and CdiI coding regions. CdiA-CT heterogeneity implies that a range of toxic activities are used during CDI. Indeed, CdiA-CTs from uropathogenic E. coli and the plant pathogen Dickeya dadantii have different nuclease activities, each providing a distinct mechanism of growth inhibition. Finally, we show that bacteria lacking the CdiA-CT and CdiI coding regions are unable to compete with isogenic wild-type CDI+ cells both in laboratory media and on a eukaryotic host. Taken together, these results suggest that CDI systems constitute an intricate immunity network with an important function in bacterial competition.","[Aoki, Stephanie K.; de Roodenbeke, Claire t'Kint; Burgess, Brandt R.; Poole, Stephen J.; Braaten, Bruce A.; Jones, Allison M.; Webb, Julia S.; Hayes, Christopher S.; Cotter, Peggy A.; Low, David A.] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Mol Cellular & Dev Biol, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; [Diner, Elie J.; Hayes, Christopher S.; Cotter, Peggy A.; Low, David A.] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Biomol Sci & Engn Program, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA","Low, DA (reprint author), Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Mol Cellular & Dev Biol, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA.",low@lifesci.ucsb.edu,"Hayes, Christopher/A-5505-2009",,"National Science Foundation [0642052]; Tri-Counties Blood Bank; National Institutes of Health [GM078634, AI043986, U54AI065359]; United States Department of Agriculture Cooperative State Research, Education, and Extension Service [2001-52100-11316]","We thank A.

Active L1 retrotransposons can impact the genome in a variety of ways, creating insertions, deletions, new splice sites or gene expression fine-tuning(4-6). We have shown previously that L1 retrotransposons are capable of mobilization in neuronal progenitor cells from rodents and humans and evidence of massive L1 insertions was observed in adult brain tissues but not in other somatic tissues(7,8). In addition, L1 mobility in the adult hippocampus can be influenced by the environment(9). The neuronal specificity of somatic L1 retrotransposition in neural progenitors is partially due to the transition of a Sox2/HDAC1 repressor complex to a Wnt-mediated T-cell factor/lymphoid enhancer factor (TCF/LEF) transcriptional activator(7,10). The transcriptional switch accompanies chromatin remodelling during neuronal differentiation, allowing a transient stimulation of L1 transcription(7). The activity of L1 retrotransposons during brain development can have an impact on gene expression and neuronal function, thereby increasing brain-specific genetic mosaicism(11,12). Further understanding of the molecular mechanisms that regulate L1 expression should provide new insights into the role of L1 retrotransposition during brain development. Here we show that L1 neuronal transcription and retrotransposition in rodents are increased in the absence of methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MeCP2), a protein involved in global DNA methylation and human neurodevelopmental diseases. Using neuronal progenitor cells derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells and human tissues, we revealed that patients with Rett syndrome (RTT), carrying MeCP2 mutations, have increased susceptibility for L1 retrotransposition. Our data demonstrate that L1 retrotransposition can be controlled in a tissue-specific manner and that disease-related genetic mutations can influence the frequency of neuronal L1 retrotransposition. Our findings add a new level of complexity to the molecular events that can lead to neurological disorders.","[Muotri, Alysson R.] Univ Calif San Diego, Sch Med, Dept Pediat,Dept Cellular & Mol Med, Rady Childrens Hosp San Diego,Stem Cell Program, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Marchetto, Maria C.

They do this by releasing the pore-forming protein perforin and granzyme proteases from cytoplasmic granules into the cleft formed between the abutting killer and target cell membranes. Perforin, a 67-kilodalton multidomain protein, oligomerizes to form pores that deliver the pro-apoptopic granzymes into the cytosol of the target cell(1-6). The importance of perforin is highlighted by the fatal consequences of congenital perforin deficiency, with more than 50 different perforin mutations linked to familial haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (type 2 FHL)(7). Here we elucidate the mechanism of perforin pore formation by determining the X-ray crystal structure of monomeric murine perforin, together with a cryo-electron microscopy reconstruction of the entire perforin pore. Perforin is a thin 'key-shaped' molecule, comprising an amino-terminal membrane attack complex perforin-like (MACPF)/cholesterol dependent cytolysin (CDC) domain(8,9) followed by an epidermal growth factor (EGF) domain that, together with the extreme carboxy-terminal sequence, forms a central shelf-like structure. A C-terminal C2 domain mediates initial, Ca(2+)-dependent membrane binding. Most unexpectedly, however, electron microscopy reveals that the orientation of the perforin MACPF domain in the pore is inside-out relative to the subunit arrangement in CDCs(10,11). These data reveal remarkable flexibility in the mechanism of action of the conserved MACPF/CDC fold and provide new insights into how related immune defence molecules such as complement proteins assemble into pores.","[Voskoboinik, Ilia; Baran, Katherine; Verschoor, Sandra; Browne, Kylie A.; Ciccone, Annette; Trapani, Joseph A.] Peter MacCallum Canc Ctr, Canc Immunol Program, Melbourne, Vic 3002, Australia; [Law, Ruby H.

Here we show that a West Nile virus (WNV) mutant (E218A) that lacks 2'-O MTase activity was attenuated in wild-type primary cells and mice but was pathogenic in the absence of type I interferon (IFN) signalling. 2'-O methylation of viral RNA did not affect IFN induction in WNV-infected fibroblasts but instead modulated the antiviral effects of IFN-induced proteins with tetratricopeptide repeats (IFIT), which are interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) implicated in regulation of protein translation. Poxvirus and coronavirus mutants that lacked 2'-O MTase activity similarly showed enhanced sensitivity to the antiviral actions of IFN and, specifically, IFIT proteins. Our results demonstrate that the 2'-O methylation of the 5' cap of viral RNA functions to subvert innate host antiviral responses through escape of IFIT-mediated suppression, and suggest an evolutionary explanation for 2'-O methylation of cellular mRNA: to distinguish self from non-self RNA. Differential methylation of cytoplasmic RNA probably serves as an example for pattern recognition and restriction of propagation of foreign viral RNA in host cells.","[Daffis, Stephane; Szretter, Kristy J.; Youn, Soonjeon; Diamond, Michael S.] Washington Univ, Sch Med, Dept Med, St Louis, MO 63110 USA; [Li, Jianqing; Diamond, Michael S.] Washington Univ, Sch Med, Dept Mol Microbiol, St Louis, MO 63110 USA; [Diamond, Michael S.] Washington Univ, Sch Med, Dept Pathol & Immunol, St Louis, MO 63110 USA; [Buller, R.

We have shown that key factors supporting pluripotency-Nanog, Oct4 and Sox2-bind within Xist intron 1 in undifferentiated embryonic stem cells (ESC) to repress Xist transcription(5). However, the relationship between transcription factors of the pluripotency network and Tsix regulation has remained unclear(5,6). Here we show that Tsix upregulation in embryonic stem cells depends on the recruitment of the pluripotent marker Rex1, and of the reprogramming-associated factors Klf4 and c-Myc, by the DXPas34 minisatellite associated with the Tsix promoter. Upon deletion of DXPas34, binding of the three factors is abrogated and the transcriptional machinery is no longer efficiently recruited to the Tsix promoter. Additional analyses including knockdown experiments further demonstrate that Rex1 is critically important for efficient transcription elongation of Tsix. Hence, distinct embryonic-stem-cell-specific complexes couple X-inactivation reprogramming and pluripotency, with Nanog, Oct4 and Sox2 repressing Xist to facilitate the reactivation of the inactive X, and Klf4, c-Myc and Rex1 activating Tsix to remodel Xist chromatin(7-10) and ensure random X-inactivation upon differentiation(1). The holistic pattern of Xist/Tsix regulation by pluripotent factors that we have identified suggests a general direct governance of complex epigenetic processes by the machinery dedicated to pluripotency.","[Navarro, Pablo; Oldfield, Andrew; Legoupi, Julie; Dubois, Agnes; Attia, Mikael; Rougeulle, Claire; Avner, Philip] Inst Pasteur, URA 2578, Unite Genet Mol Murine, F-75724 Paris 15, France; [Navarro, Pablo; Festuccia, Nicola; Chambers, Ian] Univ Edinburgh, Sch Biol Sci, Inst Stem Cell Res, Ctr Dev Stem Cell Biol,MRC, Edinburgh EH9 3JQ, Midlothian, Scotland; [Oldfield, Andrew; Rougeulle, Claire] Univ Paris Diderot, CNRS, UMR Epigenet & Destin Cellulaire 7216, F-75205 Paris 13, France; [Schoorlemmer, Jon] ARAID Fdn, Zaragoza 50013, Spain; [Schoorlemmer, Jon] Fac Vet, Inst Aragones Ciencias Salud, Dept Anat & Embriol, Zaragoza 50013, Spain","Avner, P (reprint author), Inst Pasteur, URA 2578, Unite Genet Mol Murine, F-75724 Paris 15, France.",pablo.navarro@ed.ac.uk; pavner@pasteur.fr,"Chambers, Ian/H-5416-2011","Chambers, Ian/0000-0003-2605-1597","Institut Pasteur; Royal Society; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique; Agence Nationale de la Recherche [05-JCJC-0166-01, 07-BLAN-0047-01]; EU Epigenome Network of Excellence; INSERM; European Research Council; Wellcome Trust; EU; Medical Research Council","We thank P.

However, only a small fraction of halogenated compounds have been isolated from terrestrial plants(2). Given the impact that halogenation can have on the biological activity of natural products(1), we reasoned that the introduction of halides into medicinal plant metabolism would provide the opportunity to rationally bioengineer a broad variety of novel plant products with altered, and perhaps improved, pharmacological properties. Here we report that chlorination biosynthetic machinery from soil bacteria can be successfully introduced into the medicinal plant Catharanthus roseus (Madagascar periwinkle). These prokaryotic halogenases function within the context of the plant cell to generate chlorinated tryptophan, which is then shuttled into monoterpene indole alkaloid metabolism to yield chlorinated alkaloids. A new functional group-a halide-is thereby introduced into the complex metabolism of C. roseus, and is incorporated in a predictable and regioselective manner onto the plant alkaloid products. Medicinal plants, despite their genetic and developmental complexity, therefore seem to be a viable platform for synthetic biology efforts.","[Runguphan, Weerawat; Qu, Xudong; O'Connor, Sarah E.] MIT, Dept Chem, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA","O'Connor, SE (reprint author), MIT, Dept Chem, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",soc@mit.edu,"Qu, Xudong/E-1778-2016","Qu, Xudong/0000-0002-3301-8536; O'Connor, Sarah/0000-0003-0356-6213",NIH [GM074820]; American Cancer Society [RSG-07-025-01-CDD],We acknowledge support from the NIH (GM074820) and the American Cancer Society (RSG-07-025-01-CDD).

After a century of studying schizophrenia, the cause of the disorder remains unknown. Treatments, especially pharmacological treatments, have been in wide use for nearly half a century, yet there is little evidence that these treatments have substantially improved outcomes for most people with schizophrenia. These current unsatisfactory outcomes may change as we approach schizophrenia as a neurodevelopmental disorder with psychosis as a late, potentially preventable stage of the illness.

Rett syndrome is characterized by apparently normal early development followed by regression, motor abnormalities, seizures and features of autism, especially stereotyped behaviours. The mechanisms mediating these features are poorly understood. Here we show that mice lacking Mecp2 from GABA (c-aminobutyric acid)-releasing neurons recapitulate numerous Rett syndrome and autistic features, including repetitive behaviours. Loss of MeCP2 from a subset of forebrain GABAergic neurons also recapitulates many features of Rett syndrome. MeCP2-deficient GABAergic neurons show reduced inhibitory quantal size, consistent with a presynaptic reduction in glutamic acid decarboxylase 1 (Gad1) and glutamic acid decarboxylase 2 (Gad2) levels, and GABA immunoreactivity. These data demonstrate that MeCP2 is critical for normal function of GABA-releasing neurons and that subtle dysfunction of GABAergic neurons contributes to numerous neuropsychiatric phenotypes.","[Chao, Hsiao-Tuan; Xue, Mingshan; Noebels, Jeffrey L.; Rosenmund, Christian; Zoghbi, Huda Y.] Baylor Coll Med, Dept Neurosci, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Chao, Hsiao-Tuan; Chen, Hongmei; Samaco, Rodney C.; Chahrour, Maria; Noebels, Jeffrey L.; Rosenmund, Christian; Zoghbi, Huda Y.] Baylor Coll Med, Dept Mol & Human Genet, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Yoo, Jong; Noebels, Jeffrey L.; Zoghbi, Huda Y.] Baylor Coll Med, Dept Neurol, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Neul, Jeffrey L.; Lu, Hui-Chen; Zoghbi, Huda Y.] Baylor Coll Med, Dept Pediat, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Neul, Jeffrey L.; Lu, Hui-Chen; Zoghbi, Huda Y.] Baylor Coll Med, Texas Childrens Hosp, Jan & Dan Duncan Neurol Res Inst, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Zoghbi, Huda Y.] Baylor Coll Med, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Gong, Shiaoching; Heintz, Nathaniel] Rockefeller Univ, New York, NY 10021 USA; [Gong, Shiaoching; Heintz, Nathaniel] Howard Hughes Med Inst, New York, NY 10021 USA; [Ekker, Marc] Univ Ottawa, Dept Biol, Ctr Adv Res Environm Genom, Ottawa, ON K1N 6N5, Canada; [Rubenstein, John L.

Channelrhodopsin-2-assisted circuit mapping in amygdala slices and cell-specific viral tracing indicate that PKC-delta(+) neurons inhibit output neurons in the medial central amygdala (CEm), and also make reciprocal inhibitory synapses with PKC-delta(-) neurons in CEl. Electrical silencing of PKC-delta(+) neurons in vivo suggests that they correspond to physiologically identified units that are inhibited by the conditioned stimulus, called CEl(off) units.

How the acquisition and expression of conditioned fear are encoded within CEA inhibitory circuits is not understood. Using in vivo electrophysiological, optogenetic and pharmacological approaches in mice, we show that neuronal activity in the lateral subdivision of the central amygdala (CEl) is required for fear acquisition, whereas conditioned fear responses are driven by output neurons in the medial subdivision (CEm). Functional circuit analysis revealed that inhibitory CEA microcircuits are highly organized and that cell-type-specific plasticity of phasic and tonic activity in the CEl to CEm pathway may gate fear expression and regulate fear generalization.

Following initial indications of broken time-reversal symmetry in photoemission experiments(2), recent polarized neutron diffraction work demonstrated the universal existence of an unusual magnetic order below T* (refs 3, 4). These findings have the profound implication that the pseudogap regime constitutes a genuine new phase of matter rather than a mere crossover phenomenon. They are furthermore consistent with a particular type of order involving circulating orbital currents, and with the notion that the phase diagram is controlled by a quantum critical point(5). Here we report inelastic neutron scattering results for HgBa2CuO4+delta that reveal a fundamental collective magnetic mode associated with the unusual order, and which further support this picture. The mode's intensity rises below the same temperature T* and its dispersion is weak, as expected for an Ising-like order parameter(6). Its energy of 52-56 meV renders it a new candidate for the hitherto unexplained ubiquitous electron-boson coupling features observed in spectroscopic studies(7-10).","[Yu, G.; Greven, M.] Univ Minnesota, Sch Phys & Astron, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA; [Li, Yuan] Stanford Univ, Dept Phys, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Baledent, V.; Sidis, Y.; Bourges, P.] CEA Saclay, CEA, CNRS, Lab Leon Brillouin, F-91191 Gif Sur Yvette, France; [Barisic, N.; Zhao, X.] Stanford Univ, TH Geballe Lab Adv Mat, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Barisic, N.] Univ Stuttgart, Inst Phys 1, D-70550 Stuttgart, Germany; [Hradil, K.] Univ Gottingen, Inst Phys Chem, D-37077 Gottingen, Germany; [Mole, R.

In particular, compound semiconductors heterogeneously integrated on Si substrates have been actively studied(7,9,10): such devices combine the high mobility of III-V semiconductors and the well established, low-cost processing of Si technology. This integration, however, presents significant challenges. Conventionally, heteroepitaxial growth of complex multilayers on Si has been explored(9,11-13)-but besides complexity, high defect densities and junction leakage currents present limitations in this approach. Motivated by this challenge, here we use an epitaxial transfer method for the integration of ultrathin layers of single-crystal InAs on Si/SiO(2) substrates. As a parallel with silicon-on-insulator (SOI) technology(14), we use 'XOI' to represent our compound semiconductoron-insulator platform. Through experiments and simulation, the electrical properties of InAs XOI transistors are explored, elucidating the critical role of quantum confinement in the transport properties of ultrathin XOI layers. Importantly, a high-quality InAs/dielectric interface is obtained by the use of a novel thermally grown interfacial InAsO(x) layer (similar to 1 nm thick). The fabricated field-effect transistors exhibit a peak transconductance of similar to 1.6 mS mu m(-1) at a drain-source voltage of 0.5 V, with an on/off current ratio of greater than 10,000.","[Ko, Hyunhyub; Takei, Kuniharu; Kapadia, Rehan; Chuang, Steven; Fang, Hui; Leu, Paul W.; Madsen, Morten; Ford, Alexandra C.; Javey, Ali] Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley Sensor & Actuator Ctr, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Ko, Hyunhyub; Takei, Kuniharu; Kapadia, Rehan; Chuang, Steven; Fang, Hui; Leu, Paul W.; Madsen, Morten; Ford, Alexandra C.; Javey, Ali] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Div Mat Sci, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Chen, Szu-Ying; Chueh, Yu-Lun] Natl Tsing Hua Univ, Hsinchu 30013, Taiwan; [Plis, Elena; Kim, Ha Sul; Krishna, Sanjay] Univ New Mexico, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Albuquerque, NM 87106 USA; [Plis, Elena; Kim, Ha Sul; Krishna, Sanjay] Univ New Mexico, Ctr High Technol Mat, Albuquerque, NM 87106 USA","Javey, A (reprint author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley Sensor & Actuator Ctr, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",ajavey@eecs.berkeley.edu,"Krishna, Sanjay /C-5766-2009; Ganapathi, Kartik/C-7631-2011; Madsen, Morten/K-8597-2012; Kapadia, Rehan/B-4100-2013; Fang, Hui/I-8973-2014; Leu, Paul/B-9989-2008; Javey, Ali/B-4818-2013; Ko, Hyunhyub/C-4848-2009; Chueh, Yu-Lun/E-2053-2013","Kapadia, Rehan/0000-0002-7611-0551; Fang, Hui/0000-0002-4651-9786; Leu, Paul/0000-0002-1599-7144; Chueh, Yu-Lun/0000-0002-0155-9987; Madsen, Morten/0000-0001-6503-0479","MARCO/MSD Focus Center; Intel Corporation; BSAC; LDRD from Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; Sloan research fellowship; NSF; Sunchon National University; Danish Research Council for Technology and Production Sciences; AFOSR [FA9550-10-1-0113]; National Science Council, Taiwan [NSC 98-2112-M-007-025-MY3]","This work was funded by the MARCO/MSD Focus Center, Intel Corporation and BSAC.

Key stages in increasing oxygenation are postulated for the Palaeoproterozoic era (similar to 2.3 billion years ago, Gyr ago) and the late Proterozoic eon (about 0.8 Gyr ago), with the latter implicated in the subsequent metazoan evolutionary expansion(8). In support of this rise in oxygen concentrations, a large database(1-3,9) shows a marked change in the bacterially mediated fractionation of seawater sulphate to sulphide of Delta (34)S, 25 parts per thousand before 1 Gyr to >= 50 parts per thousand after 0.64 Gyr. This change in Delta (34)S has been interpreted to represent the evolution from single-step bacterial sulphate reduction to a combination of bacterial sulphate reduction and sulphide oxidation, largely bacterially mediated(3,7,9). This evolution is seen as marking the rise in atmospheric oxygen concentrations and the evolution of non-photosynthetic sulphide-oxidizing bacteria(3,7,10). Here we report Delta (34)S values exceeding 50 parts per thousand from a terrestrial Mesoproterozoic (1.18 Gyr old) succession in Scotland, a time period that is at present poorly characterized. This level of fractionation implies disproportionation in the sulphur cycle, probably involving sulphide-oxidizing bacteria, that is not evident from Delta (34)S data in the marine record(1-3,9). Disproportionation in both red beds and lacustrine black shales at our study site suggests that the Mesoproterozoic terrestrial environment was sufficiently oxygenated to support a biota that was adapted to an oxygen-rich atmosphere, but had also penetrated into subsurface sediment.","[Parnell, John; Bowden, Stephen; Spinks, Sam] Univ Aberdeen, Sch Geosci, Aberdeen AB24 3UE, Scotland; [Boyce, Adrian J.; Mark, Darren] Scottish Univ Environm Res Ctr, Glasgow G75 0QF, Lanark, Scotland","Parnell, J (reprint author), Univ Aberdeen, Sch Geosci, Aberdeen AB24 3UE, Scotland.",j.parnell@abdn.ac.uk,"Mark, Darren/A-5121-2009; Boyce, Adrian/D-2263-2010","Boyce, Adrian/0000-0002-9680-0787",University of Aberdeen; NERC; Scottish Universities Consortium,"We thank D.

If extension continues to final break-up, the split and greatly thinned plates subside deep below sea level to form a conjugate pair of rifted margins. Although basins and margins are ubiquitous structures, the deformation processes leading from moderately extended basins to highly stretched margins are unclear, as studies consistently report that crustal thinning is greater than extension caused by brittle faulting(1-4). This extension discrepancy might arise from differential stretching of brittle and ductile crustal layers(2), but that does not readily explain the typical asymmetric structure of conjugate margins(5,6)-in cross-section, one margin displays gradual thinning accompanied by large faults, and the conjugate margin displays abrupt thinning but smaller-scale faulting(5). Whole-crust detachments, active from early in the rifting, could in theory create both thinning and asymmetry(1), but are mechanically problematical. Furthermore, the extension discrepancy occurs at both conjugate margins, leading to the apparent contradiction that both seem to be upper plates to a detachment fault(7,8). Alternative models propose that much brittle extension is undetected because of seismic imaging limitations caused either by subseismic-resolution faulting(9), invisible deformation along top-basement 100-km-scale detachments(8) or the structural complexity of cross-cutting arrays of faults(3). Here we use depth-migrated seismic images to accurately measure fault extension and compare it with crustal thinning. The observations are used to create a balanced kinematic model of rifting that resolves the extension discrepancy by producing both fault-controlled crustal thinning which progresses from a rift basin to the asymmetric structure, and extreme thinning of conjugate rifted margins. Contrary to current wisdom, the observations support the idea that thinning is to a first degree explained by simple Andersonian faulting that is unambiguously visible in seismic data.","[Ranero, Cesar R.] CSIC, Inst Ciencias Mar, Barcelona Ctr Subsurface Imaging, ICREA, E-08003 Barcelona, Spain; [Perez-Gussinye, Marta] Univ London, Dept Earth Sci, Egham TW20 0BD, Surrey, England","Ranero, CR (reprint author), CSIC, Inst Ciencias Mar, Barcelona Ctr Subsurface Imaging, ICREA, Passeig Maritim Barcelona 37-49, E-08003 Barcelona, Spain.",cranero@icm.csic.es; m.perez@es.rhul.ac.uk,"Ranero, Cesar/B-9165-2009; Perez-Gussinye, Marta/R-1704-2016","Ranero, Cesar/0000-0002-5204-545X; Perez-Gussinye, Marta/0000-0003-4109-1810",Repsol; Ministry of Science and Innovation; ICREA,"The ideas presented in this work have benefited from discussions with J.

In the lamina, the first optic neuropile of Drosophila melanogaster, photoreceptor signals split into five parallel pathways, L1-L5(1). Here we examine how these pathways contribute to visual motion detection by combining genetic block and reconstitution of neural activity in different lamina cell types with whole-cell recordings from downstream motion-sensitive neurons(2,3). We find reduced responses to moving gratings if L1 or L2 is blocked; however, reconstitution of photoreceptor input to only L1 or L2 results in wild-type responses. Thus, the first experiment indicates the necessity of both pathways, whereas the second indicates sufficiency of each single pathway. This contradiction can be explained by electrical coupling between L1 and L2, allowing for activation of both pathways even when only one of them receives photoreceptor input. A fundamental difference between the L1 pathway and the L2 pathway is uncovered when blocking L1 or L2 output while presenting moving edges of positive (ON) or negative (OFF) contrast polarity: blocking L1 eliminates the response to moving ON edges, whereas blocking L2 eliminates the response to moving OFF edges. Thus, similar to the segregation of photoreceptor signals in ON and OFF bipolar cell pathways in the vertebrate retina(4), photoreceptor signals segregate into ON-L1 and OFF-L2 channels in the lamina of Drosophila.","[Joesch, Maximilian; Schnell, Bettina; Raghu, Shamprasad Varija; Reiff, Dierk F.; Borst, Alexander] MPI Neurobiol, Dept Syst & Computat Neurobiol, D-82152 Martinsried, Germany","Borst, A (reprint author), MPI Neurobiol, Dept Syst & Computat Neurobiol, Klopferspitz 18, D-82152 Martinsried, Germany.",borst@neuro.mpg.de,,"Joesch, Maximilian/0000-0002-3937-1330; Schnell, Bettina/0000-0001-7700-2600",,,,30,115,116,0,35,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,11-Nov,2010,468,7321,,,,,300,U186,,10.1038/nature09545,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,678DG,WOS:000284051000050,21068841,No,,,11/20/17

The brain region adjacent to stroke damage-the peri-infarct zone-is critical for rehabilitation, as it shows heightened neuroplasticity, allowing sensorimotor functions to re-map from damaged areas(1-3). Thus, understanding the neuronal properties constraining this plasticity is important for the development of new treatments. Here we show that after a stroke in mice, tonic neuronal inhibition is increased in the peri-infarct zone. This increased tonic inhibition is mediated by extrasynaptic GABA(A) receptors and is caused by an impairment in GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid) transporter (GAT-3/GAT-4) function. To counteract the heightened inhibition, we administered in vivo a benzodiazepine inverse agonist specific for alpha 5-subunit-containing extrasynaptic GABA(A) receptors at a delay after stroke. This treatment produced an early and sustained recovery of motor function. Genetically lowering the number of alpha 5- or delta-subunit-containing GABA(A) receptors responsible for tonic inhibition also proved beneficial for recovery after stroke, consistent with the therapeutic potential of diminishing extrasynaptic GABA(A) receptor function. Together, our results identify new pharmacological targets and provide the rationale for a novel strategy to promote recovery after stroke and possibly other brain injuries.","[Clarkson, Andrew N.; Huang, Ben S.; MacIsaac, Sarah E.; Mody, Istvan; Carmichael, S.

These findings suggest that endothelial cells not only form passive conduits to deliver nutrients and oxygen, but also establish an instructive vascular niche, which through elaboration of paracrine trophogens stimulates organ regeneration, in a manner similar to endothelial-cell-derived angiocrine factors that support haematopoiesis(5-7). However, the precise mechanism by which tissue-specific subsets of endothelial cells promote organogenesis in adults is unknown. Here we demonstrate that liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) constitute a unique population of phenotypically and functionally defined VEGFR3(+)CD34(-)VEGFR2(+)VE-cadherin(+)FactorVIII(+)CD452(-) endothelial cells, which through the release of angiocrine trophogens initiate and sustain liver regeneration induced by 70% partial hepatectomy. After partial hepatectomy, residual liver vasculature remains intact without experiencing hypoxia or structural damage, which allows study of physiological liver regeneration. Using this model, we show that inducible genetic ablation of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-A receptor-2 (VEGFR2) in the LSECs impairs the initial burst of hepatocyte proliferation (days 1-3 after partial hepatectomy) and subsequent reconstitution of the hepatovascular mass (days 4-8 after partial hepatectomy) by inhibiting upregulation of the endothelial-cell-specific transcription factor Id1. Accordingly, Id1-deficient mice also manifest defects throughout liver regeneration, owing to diminished expression of LSEC-derived angiocrine factors, including hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) and Wnt2. Notably, in in vitro co-cultures, VEGFR2-Id1 activation in LSECs stimulates hepatocyte proliferation. Indeed, intrasplenic transplantation of Id1(+/+) or Id1(-/-) LSECs transduced with Wnt2 and HGF (Id1(-/-)Wnt2(+)HGF(+) LSECs) re-establishes an inductive vascular niche in the liver sinusoids of the Id1(-/-) mice, initiating and restoring hepatovascular regeneration. Therefore, in the early phases of physiological liver regeneration, VEGFR2-Id1-mediated inductive angiogenesis in LSECs through release of angiocrine factors Wnt2 and HGF provokes hepatic proliferation. Subsequently, VEGFR2-Id1-dependent proliferative angiogenesis reconstitutes liver mass. Therapeutic co-transplantation of inductive VEGFR2(+)Id1(+)Wnt2(+)HGF(+) LSECs with hepatocytes provides an effective strategy to achieve durable liver regeneration.","[Ding, Bi-Sen; Nolan, Daniel J.; Butler, Jason M.; James, Daylon; Babazadeh, Alexander O.; Kobayashi, Hideki; Shido, Koji; Rabbany, Sina Y.; Rafii, Shahin] Weill Cornell Med Coll, Ansary Stem Cell Inst, Howard Hughes Med Inst, New York, NY 10065 USA; [Ding, Bi-Sen; Nolan, Daniel J.; Butler, Jason M.; James, Daylon; Babazadeh, Alexander O.; Kobayashi, Hideki; Shido, Koji; Rabbany, Sina Y.; Rafii, Shahin] Weill Cornell Med Coll, Dept Med Genet, New York, NY 10065 USA; [Rosenwaks, Zev] Ronald O Perelman & Claudia Cohen Ctr Reprod Med, New York, NY 10065 USA; [Mittal, Vivek] Weill Cornell Med Coll, Dept Surg, New York, NY 10065 USA; [Lyden, David] Weill Cornell Med Coll, Dept Pediat, New York, NY 10065 USA; [Sato, Thomas N.] Nara Inst Sci & Technol, Grad Sch Biol Sci, Nara, Japan; [Rabbany, Sina Y.] Hofstra Univ, Bioengn Program, Hempstead, NY 11549 USA","Rafii, S (reprint author), Weill Cornell Med Coll, Ansary Stem Cell Inst, Howard Hughes Med Inst, New York, NY 10065 USA.",srafii@med.cornell.edu,,,"Howard Hughes Medical Institute; Ansary Stem Cell Institute; National Institutes of Health [HL097797, U01 HL-66592-03, RC1 AI080309]; Qatar National Priorities Research Program; Anbinder and Newmans Own Foundations; Empire State Stem Cell Board; New York State Department of Health [NYS C024180]; MEXT; Takeda Science Foundation; Uehara Memorial Life Science Foundation","S.R. is supported by the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, the Ansary Stem Cell Institute, National Institutes of Health grants HL097797, U01 HL-66592-03 and RC1 AI080309, the Qatar National Priorities Research Program, the Anbinder and Newmans Own Foundations, the Empire State Stem Cell Board and a New York State Department of Health grant, NYS C024180.

The full potential of hESCs in research and clinical applications requires a detailed understanding of the genetic network that governs the unique properties of hESCs. Here, we report a genome-wide RNA interference screen to identify genes which regulate self-renewal and pluripotency properties in hESCs. Interestingly, functionally distinct complexes involved in transcriptional regulation and chromatin remodelling are among the factors identified in the screen. To understand the roles of these potential regulators of hESCs, we studied transcription factor PRDM14 to gain new insights into its functional roles in the regulation of pluripotency. We showed that PRDM14 regulates directly the expression of key pluripotency gene POU5F1 through its proximal enhancer. Genome-wide location profiling experiments revealed that PRDM14 colocalized extensively with other key transcription factors such as OCT4, NANOG and SOX2, indicating that PRDM14 is integrated into the core transcriptional regulatory network. More importantly, in a gain-of-function assay, we showed that PRDM14 is able to enhance the efficiency of reprogramming of human fibroblasts in conjunction with OCT4, SOX2 and KLF4. Altogether, our study uncovers a wealth of novel hESC regulators wherein PRDM14 exemplifies a key transcription factor required for the maintenance of hESC identity and the reacquisition of pluripotency in human somatic cells.","[Chia, Na-Yu; Chan, Yun-Shen; Feng, Bo; Lu, Xinyi; Yang, Lin; Jiang, Jianming; Lau, Mei-Sheng; Ng, Huck-Hui] Genome Inst Singapore, Gene Regulat Lab, Singapore 138672, Singapore; [Chia, Na-Yu; Ng, Huck-Hui] Nanyang Technol Univ, Sch Biol Sci, Singapore 637551, Singapore; [Chan, Yun-Shen; Ng, Huck-Hui] Natl Univ Singapore, Grad Sch Integrat Sci & Engn, Singapore 117456, Singapore; [Lu, Xinyi; Ng, Huck-Hui] Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Biol Sci, Singapore 117543, Singapore; [Orlov, Yuriy L.; Huss, Mikael; Clarke, Neil D.] Genome Inst Singapore, Computat & Syst Biol Grp, Singapore 138672, Singapore; [Moreau, Dimitri; Kumar, Pankaj; Bard, Frederic] Inst Mol & Cell Biol, Singapore 138673, Singapore; [Lim, Bing] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Ctr Life Sci, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Clarke, Neil D.; Bard, Frederic; Ng, Huck-Hui] Natl Univ Singapore, Yong Loo Lin Sch Med, Dept Biochem, Singapore 117597, Singapore","Ng, HH (reprint author), Genome Inst Singapore, Gene Regulat Lab, 60 Biopolis St, Singapore 138672, Singapore.",fbard@imcb.a-star.edu.sg; nghh@gis.a-star.edu.sg,"; Bard, Frederic/G-9914-2011; jiang, jianming/B-3421-2012; ASTAR, IMCB/E-2320-2012; Moreau, Dimitri/E-5092-2012; Ng, Huck Hui/A-1135-2009; Feng, Bo/D-7831-2014; Clarke, Neil/D-9613-2014; Kraus, Petra/I-5849-2014; Orlov, Yuriy/F-1520-2013; Moreau, Dimitri/A-7503-2017","CHIA, NA YU/0000-0003-1092-4699; Huss, Mikael/0000-0003-0839-2451; Lufkin, Thomas/0000-0002-7902-4771; Bard, Frederic/0000-0002-3783-4805; jiang, jianming/0000-0003-3251-2716; Moreau, Dimitri/0000-0002-9282-3324; Feng, Bo/0000-0002-4018-3257; Kraus, Petra/0000-0002-6716-5550; Orlov, Yuriy/0000-0003-0587-1609; Moreau, Dimitri/0000-0002-9282-3324","Biomedical Research Council (BMRC); Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*STAR); Singapore Stem Cell Consortium","We are grateful to the Biomedical Research Council (BMRC), Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*STAR) and Singapore Stem Cell Consortium for funding.

However, it remains unresolved how aneuploidy impacts gene expression and whether aneuploidy could directly bring about phenotypic variation and improved fitness over that of euploid counterparts. Here we show, using quantitative mass spectrometry-based proteomics and phenotypic profiling, that levels of protein expression in aneuploid yeast strains largely scale with chromosome copy numbers, following the same trend as that observed for the transcriptome, and that aneuploidy confers diverse phenotypes. We designed a novel scheme to generate, through random meiotic segregation, 38 stable and fully isogenic aneuploid yeast strains with distinct karyotypes and genome contents between 1N and 3N without involving any genetic selection. Through quantitative growth assays under various conditions or in the presence of a panel of chemotherapeutic or antifungal drugs, we found that some aneuploid strains grew significantly better than euploid control strains under conditions suboptimal for the latter. These results provide strong evidence that aneuploidy directly affects gene expression at both the transcriptome and proteome levels and can generate significant phenotypic variation that could bring about fitness gains under diverse conditions. Our findings suggest that the fitness ranking between euploid and aneuploid cells is dependent on context and karyotype, providing the basis for the notion that aneuploidy can directly underlie phenotypic evolution and cellular adaptation.","[Pavelka, Norman; Rancati, Giulia; Zhu, Jin; Bradford, William D.; Saraf, Anita; Florens, Laurence; Sanderson, Brian W.; Hattem, Gaye L.; Li, Rong] Stowers Inst Med Res, Kansas City, MO 64110 USA; [Li, Rong] Univ Kansas, Med Ctr, Dept Mol & Integrat Physiol, Kansas City, KS 66160 USA","Li, R (reprint author), Stowers Inst Med Res, 1000 E 50th St, Kansas City, MO 64110 USA.",rli@stowers.org,,"Rancati, Giulia/0000-0003-0835-0139; Florens, Laurence/0000-0002-9310-6650; Hattem, Gaye/0000-0002-2411-3056; Pavelka, Norman/0000-0003-4542-9970",NIH [RO1GM059964],"We thank C.

This process is operated by the intasome, a nucleoprotein complex composed of an integrase tetramer (IN) assembled on the viral DNA ends(3,4). The intasome engages chromosomal DNA within a target capture complex to carry out strand transfer, irreversibly joining the viral and cellular DNA molecules. Although several intasome/transpososome structures from the DDE(D) recombinase superfamily have been reported(4-6), the mechanics of target DNA capture and strand transfer by these enzymes remained unclear. Here we report crystal structures of the intasome from prototype foamy virus in complex with target DNA, elucidating the pre-integration target DNA capture and post-catalytic strand transfer intermediates of the retroviral integration process. The cleft between IN dimers within the intasome accommodates chromosomal DNA in a severely bent conformation, allowing widely spaced IN active sites to access the scissile phosphodiester bonds. Our results resolve the structural basis for retroviral DNA integration and provide a framework for the design of INs with altered target sequences.","[Maertens, Goedele N.; Hare, Stephen; Cherepanov, Peter] Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Div Infect Dis, London W2 1PG, England","Cherepanov, P (reprint author), Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Div Infect Dis, St Marys Campus,Norfolk Pl, London W2 1PG, England.",p.cherepanov@imperial.ac.uk,"Cherepanov, Peter/F-6859-2010; Maertens, Goedele/D-8628-2015","Cherepanov, Peter/0000-0002-0634-538X; Maertens, Goedele/0000-0002-1963-8026; Hare, Stephen/0000-0003-2951-1595",UK Medical Research Council,"We thank A.

Escherichia coli AlkB is the first such enzyme that was discovered to repair methylated nucleic acids(5,6), which are otherwise cytotoxic and/or mutagenic. AlkB human homologues are known to play pivotal roles in various processes(7-11). Here we present structural characterization of oxidation intermediates for these demethylases. Using a chemical cross-linking strategy(12,13), complexes of AlkB-double stranded DNA (dsDNA) containing 1,N-6-etheno adenine (epsilon A), N-3-methyl thymine (3-meT) and N-3-methyl cytosine (3-meC) are stabilized and crystallized, respectively. Exposing these crystals, grown under anaerobic conditions containing iron(II) and alpha-ketoglutarate (alpha KG), to dioxygen initiates oxidation in crystallo. Glycol (from epsilon A) and hemiaminal (from 3-meT) intermediates are captured; a zwitterionic intermediate (from 3-meC) is also proposed, based on crystallographic observations and computational analysis. The observation of these unprecedented intermediates provides direct support for the oxidative demethylation mechanism for these demethylases. This study also depicts a general mechanistic view of how a methyl group is oxidatively removed from different biological substrates.","[Yi, Chengqi; Jia, Guifang; Zhang, Wen; Zheng, Guanqun; Jian, Xing; Yang, Cai-Guang; He, Chuan] Univ Chicago, Dept Chem, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Yi, Chengqi; Jia, Guifang; Zhang, Wen; Zheng, Guanqun; Jian, Xing; Yang, Cai-Guang; He, Chuan] Univ Chicago, Inst Biophys Dynam, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Hou, Guanhua; Cui, Qiang] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Chem, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Hou, Guanhua; Cui, Qiang] Univ Wisconsin, Inst Theoret Chem, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Dai, Qing] Univ Chicago, Dept Biochem & Mol Biol, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Yang, Cai-Guang] Chinese Acad Sci, Shanghai Inst Mat Med, Shanghai 201203, Peoples R China","He, CA (reprint author), Univ Chicago, Dept Chem, 929 E 57th St, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.",chuanhe@uchicago.edu,,,"National Institutes of Health [GM071440, GM084028]; Advanced Photon Source at Argonne National Laboratory; United States Department of Energy","This study was supported by the National Institutes of Health (GM071440 to C.H.; GM084028 to Q.C.), beamlines 23ID-B (General Medicine and Cancer Institutes Collaborative Access Team (GM/CA-CAT)), 19BM-D (Structual Biology Center (SBC-CAT)), 14BM-C (BioCARS) and 21ID-D (Life Sciences Collaborative Access Team (LS-CAT)) at the Advanced Photon Source at Argonne National Laboratory, the National Institutes of Health and the United States Department of Energy.

We analysed these sequences, along with previously published marine prokaryotic genomes, in the context of marine metagenomic data, to gain insights into the ecology of the surface ocean prokaryotic picoplankton (0.1-3.0 mu m size range). The results suggest that the sequenced genomes define two microbial groups: one composed of only a few taxa that are nearly always abundant in picoplanktonic communities, and the other consisting of many microbial taxa that are rarely abundant. The genomic content of the second group suggests that these microbes are capable of slow growth and survival in energy-limited environments, and rapid growth in energy-rich environments. By contrast, the abundant and cosmopolitan picoplanktonic prokaryotes for which there is genomic representation have smaller genomes, are probably capable of only slow growth and seem to be relatively unable to sense or rapidly acclimate to energy-rich conditions. Their genomic features also lead us to propose that one method used to avoid predation by viruses and/or bacterivores is by means of slow growth and the maintenance of low biomass.","[Yooseph, Shibu; Nealson, Kenneth H.; Rusch, Douglas B.; McCrow, John P.; Dupont, Christopher L.; Kim, Maria; Johnson, Justin; Montgomery, Robert; Ferriera, Steve; Beeson, Karen; Williamson, Shannon J.; Tovchigrechko, Andrey; Allen, Andrew E.; Zeigler, Lisa A.; Sutton, Granger; Eisenstadt, Eric; Rogers, Yu-Hui; Friedman, Robert; Frazier, Marvin; Venter, J.

Among them, clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) loci together with cas (CRISPR-associated) genes form the CRISPR/Cas immune system, which involves partially palindromic repeats separated by short stretches of DNA called spacers, acquired from extrachromosomal elements. It was recently demonstrated that these variable loci can incorporate spacers from infecting bacteriophages and then provide immunity against subsequent bacteriophage infections in a sequence-specific manner. Here we show that the Streptococcus thermophilus CRISPR1/Cas system can also naturally acquire spacers from a self-replicating plasmid containing an antibiotic-resistance gene, leading to plasmid loss. Acquired spacers that match antibiotic-resistance genes provide a novel means to naturally select bacteria that cannot uptake and disseminate such genes. We also provide in vivo evidence that the CRISPR1/Cas system specifically cleaves plasmid and bacteriophage double-stranded DNA within the proto-spacer, at specific sites. Our data show that the CRISPR/Cas immune system is remarkably adapted to cleave invading DNA rapidly and has the potential for exploitation to generate safer microbial strains.","[Garneau, Josiane E.; Dupuis, Marie-Eve; Villion, Manuela; Magadan, Alfonso H.; Moineau, Sylvain] Univ Laval, Felix dHerelle Reference Ctr Bacterial Viruses, Dept Biochim Microbiol & Bioinformat, Fac Med Dent,Grp Rech Ecol Buccale,Fac Sci & Geni, Quebec City, PQ G1V 0A6, Canada; [Romero, Dennis A.; Barrangou, Rodolphe] Danisco USA Inc, Madison, WI 53716 USA; [Boyaval, Patrick; Fremaux, Christophe; Horvath, Philippe] Danisco France SAS, F-86220 Dange St Romain, France","Moineau, S (reprint author), Univ Laval, Felix dHerelle Reference Ctr Bacterial Viruses, Dept Biochim Microbiol & Bioinformat, Fac Med Dent,Grp Rech Ecol Buccale,Fac Sci & Geni, Quebec City, PQ G1V 0A6, Canada.",Sylvain.Moineau@bcm.ulaval.ca,"Moineau, Sylvain/N-3578-2013; Barrangou, Rodolphe/I-2878-2014; HORVATH, Philippe/K-5266-2015; Magadan, Alfonso/K-4455-2012","Barrangou, Rodolphe/0000-0002-0648-3504; HORVATH, Philippe/0000-0003-2015-8123; ",Novalait/FQRNT; Clarin/FICYT; NSERC; CIHR,"We thank T.R.

The processive hand-over-hand movement coupled with hydrolysis of adenosine triphosphate was thereby demonstrated. However, the protein molecules themselves are invisible in the observations and have therefore been visualized by electron microscopy in the stationary states. The concomitant assessment of structure and dynamics has been unfeasible, a situation prevailing throughout biological research. Here we directly visualize myosin V molecules walking along actin tracks, using high-speed atomic force microscopy. The high-resolution movies not only provide corroborative 'visual evidence' for previously speculated or demonstrated molecular behaviours, including lever-arm swing, but also reveal more detailed behaviours of the molecules, leading to a comprehensive understanding of the motor mechanism. Our direct and dynamic high-resolution visualization is a powerful new approach to studying the structure and dynamics of biomolecules in action.","[Kodera, Noriyuki; Yamamoto, Daisuke; Ando, Toshio] Kanazawa Univ, Dept Phys, Kanazawa, Ishikawa 9201192, Japan; [Kodera, Noriyuki; Yamamoto, Daisuke; Ando, Toshio] JST, CREST, Chiyoda Ku, Tokyo 1020075, Japan; [Ishikawa, Ryoki] Gunma Univ, Grad Sch Med, Dept Mol & Cellular Pharmacol, Maebashi, Gumma 3718511, Japan","Ando, T (reprint author), Kanazawa Univ, Dept Phys, Kakuma Machi, Kanazawa, Ishikawa 9201192, Japan.",tando@kenroku.kanazawa-u.ac.jp,"Kodera, Noriyuki/E-6569-2015; ANDO, Toshio/E-7054-2015","Kodera, Noriyuki/0000-0003-4880-8423; ANDO, Toshio/0000-0001-8819-154X",JST; JSPS; MEXT-Japan,"We thank T.

Although post-main-sequence mass transfer explains the masses and tight orbit(3), it leaves unexplained the observed X-ray luminosity, the star's underluminosity, the black hole's spin and the orbital eccentricity. A common envelope phase(1), or rotational mixing(4), could explain the orbit, but the former would lead to a merger and the latter to an overluminous companion. A merger would also ensue if mass transfer to the black hole were invoked for its spin-up(5). Here we report simulations of evolutionary tracks which reveal that if M33 X-7 started as a primary body of 85M(circle dot)-99M(circle dot) and a secondary body of 28M(circle dot)-32M(circle dot), in a 2.8-3.1-d orbit, its observed properties can be consistently explained. In this model, the main-sequence primary transfers part of its envelope to the secondary and loses the rest in a wind; it ends its life as a 16M(circle dot) helium star with an iron-nickel core that collapses to a black hole (with or without an accompanying supernova). The release of binding energy, and possibly collapse asymmetries, 'kick' the nascent black hole into an eccentric orbit. Wind accretion explains the X-ray luminosity, and the black-hole spin can be natal.","[Valsecchi, Francesca; Farr, Will M.; Fragos, Tassos; Willems, Bart; Kalogera, Vassiliki] Northwestern Univ, CIERA, Evanston, IL 60208 USA; [Valsecchi, Francesca; Farr, Will M.; Fragos, Tassos; Willems, Bart; Kalogera, Vassiliki] Northwestern Univ, Dept Phys & Astron, Evanston, IL 60208 USA; [Glebbeek, Evert] McMaster Univ, Dept Phys & Astron, Hamilton, ON L8S 4M1, Canada; [Orosz, Jerome A.] San Diego State Univ, Dept Astron, San Diego, CA 92182 USA; [Liu, Jifeng] Chinese Acad Sci, Natl Astron Observ, Beijing 100012, Peoples R China; [Fragos, Tassos; Liu, Jifeng] Harvard Smithsonian Ctr Astrophys, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA","Valsecchi, F (reprint author), Northwestern Univ, CIERA, 2145 Sheridan Rd, Evanston, IL 60208 USA.",francesca@u.northwestern.edu,"Fragos, Tassos/A-3581-2016","Fragos, Tassos/0000-0003-1474-1523",,,,25,21,21,1,7,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,4-Nov,2010,468,7320,,,,,77,79,,10.1038/nature09463,,3,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,674YF,WOS:000283786900038,20962778,No,,,11/20/17

Such three-dimensional (3D) images, or holograms, can be seen with the unassisted eye and are very similar to how humans see the actual environment surrounding them. The concept of 3D telepresence, a real-time dynamic hologram depicting a scene occurring in a different location, has attracted considerable public interest since it was depicted in the original Star Wars film in 1977. However, the lack of sufficient computational power to produce realistic computer-generated holograms(1) and the absence of large-area and dynamically updatable holographic recording media(2) have prevented realization of the concept. Here we use a holographic stereographic technique(3) and a photorefractive polymer material as the recording medium(4) to demonstrate a holographic display that can refresh images every two seconds. A 50 Hz nanosecond pulsed laser is used to write the holographic pixels(5). Multicoloured holographic 3D images are produced by using angular multiplexing, and the full parallax display employs spatial multiplexing. 3D telepresence is demonstrated by taking multiple images from one location and transmitting the information via Ethernet to another location where the hologram is printed with the quasi-real-time dynamic 3D display. Further improvements could bring applications in telemedicine, prototyping, advertising, updatable 3D maps and entertainment.","[Blanche, P-A; Bablumian, A.; Voorakaranam, R.; Christenson, C.; Thomas, J.; Norwood, R.

This is because its warm surface currents, such as the Gulf Stream, redistribute huge amounts of energy from tropical to high latitudes and influence regional weather and climate patterns, whereas its lower limb ventilates the deep ocean and affects the storage of carbon in the abyss, away from the atmosphere. Despite its significance for future climate, the operation of the MOC under contrasting climates of the past remains controversial. Nutrient-based proxies(1,2) and recent model simulations(3) indicate that during the Last Glacial Maximum the convective activity in the North Atlantic Ocean was much weaker than at present. In contrast, rate-sensitive radiogenic Pa-231/Th-230 isotope ratios from the North Atlantic have been interpreted to indicate only minor changes in MOC strength(4-6). Here we show that the basin-scale abyssal circulation of the Atlantic Ocean was probably reversed during the Last Glacial Maximum and was dominated by northward water flow from the Southern Ocean. These conclusions are based on new high-resolution data from the South Atlantic Ocean that establish the basin-scale north to south gradient in Pa-231/Th-230, and thus the direction of the deep ocean circulation. Our findings are consistent with nutrient-based proxies and argue that further analysis of Pa-231/Th-230 outside the North Atlantic basin will enhance our understanding of past ocean circulation, provided that spatial gradients are carefully considered. This broader perspective suggests that the modern pattern of the Atlantic MOC-with a prominent southerly flow of deep waters originating in the North Atlantic-arose only during the Holocene epoch.","[Negre, Cesar; Zahn, Rainer; Masque, Pere; Martinez-Mendez, Gema] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, ICTA, Bellaterra 08193, Spain; [Zahn, Rainer] Lluis Co 23, ICREA, Barcelona 08010, Spain; [Zahn, Rainer; Masque, Pere] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Dept Fis, Bellaterra 08193, Spain; [Thomas, Alexander L.; Henderson, Gideon M.] Univ Oxford, Dept Earth Sci, Oxford OX1 3AN, England; [Hall, Ian R.] Cardiff Univ, Sch Earth & Ocean Sci, Cardiff CF10 3YE, S Glam, Wales; [Mas, Jose L.] Univ Seville, Escuela Univ Politecn, Dipartimento Fis Aplicada 1, E-41012 Seville, Spain","Negre, C (reprint author), Univ Autonoma Barcelona, ICTA, Bellaterra 08193, Spain.",cesar@negre.us,"Thomas, Alex/D-1028-2012; Masque, Pere/B-7379-2008; Hall, Ian/C-2755-2009","Thomas, Alex/0000-0002-0734-9593; Masque, Pere/0000-0002-1789-320X; Hall, Ian/0000-0001-6960-1419; Henderson, Gideon/0000-0002-6279-7137","Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovacion, Spain [AP-2004-4278, REN2002-01958]; Comer Abrupt Climate Change Foundation; Generalitat de Catalunya;  [CGL2007-61579/CLI]; ICREA","MD02-2594 and MD02-2588 sediment cores were provided by the International Marine Past Global Changes Study (IMAGES) and the Institute Polaire Francais Paul Emile Victor (IPEV).

Although this field is rich in hypotheses(3-5), experimental evidence is scarce. Some important experiments have demonstrated differences in evolutionary rates between sexual and asexual populations(6-8); other experiments have documented evolutionary changes in phenomena related to genetic mixing, such as recombination(9,10) and selfing(11). However, direct experiments of the evolution of sex within populations are extremely rare (but see ref. 12). Here we use the rotifer, Brachionus calyciflorus, which is capable of both sexual and asexual reproduction, to test recent theory(13-15) predicting that there is more opportunity for sex to evolve in spatially heterogeneous environments. Replicated experimental populations of rotifers were maintained in homogeneous environments, composed of either high-or low-quality food habitats, or in heterogeneous environments that consisted of a mix of the two habitats. For populations maintained in either type of homogeneous environment, the rate of sex evolves rapidly towards zero. In contrast, higher rates of sex evolve in populations experiencing spatially heterogeneous environments. The data indicate that the higher level of sex observed under heterogeneity is not due to sex being less costly or selection against sex being less efficient; rather sex is sufficiently advantageous in heterogeneous environments to overwhelm its inherent costs(2). Counter to some alternative theories(16,17) for the evolution of sex, there is no evidence that genetic drift plays any part in the evolution of sex in these populations.","[Becks, Lutz; Agrawal, Aneil F.] Univ Toronto, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Toronto, ON M5S 3B2, Canada; [Becks, Lutz] Univ Cologne, Ctr Biol Sci, Inst Zool, Dept Gen Ecol, D-50931 Cologne, Germany","Becks, L (reprint author), Univ Toronto, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Toronto, ON M5S 3B2, Canada.",lutz.becks@utoronto.ca,"Becks, Lutz/I-8256-2012",,Volkswagen Foundation [I/83 517]; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (Canada),We thank C.

Localized amyloid can also have serious consequences; for example, cerebral amyloid angiopathy is an important cause of haemorrhagic stroke. The clinical presentations of amyloidosis are extremely diverse and the diagnosis is rarely made before significant organ damage is present(1). There is therefore a major unmet need for therapy that safely promotes the clearance of established amyloid deposits. Over 20 different amyloid fibril proteins are responsible for different forms of clinically significant amyloidosis and treatments that substantially reduce the abundance of the respective amyloid fibril precursor proteins can arrest amyloid accumulation(1). Unfortunately, control of fibril-protein production is not possible in some forms of amyloidosis and in others it is often slow and hazardous(1). There is no therapy that directly targets amyloid deposits for enhanced clearance. However, all amyloid deposits contain the normal, non-fibrillar plasma glycoprotein, serum amyloid P component (SAP)(2,3). Here we show that administration of anti-human-SAP antibodies to mice with amyloid deposits containing human SAP triggers a potent, complement-dependent, macrophage-derived giant cell reaction that swiftly removes massive visceral amyloid deposits without adverse effects. Anti-SAP-antibody treatment is clinically feasible because circulating human SAP can be depleted in patients by the bis-D-proline compound CPHPC(4), thereby enabling injected anti-SAP antibodies to reach residual SAP in the amyloid deposits. The unprecedented capacity of this novel combined therapy to eliminate amyloid deposits should be applicable to all forms of systemic and local amyloidosis.","[Bodin, Karl; Ellmerich, Stephan; Kahan, Melvyn C.; Tennent, Glenys A.; Loesch, Andrzej; Gilbertson, Janet A.; Hutchinson, Winston L.; Mangione, Palma P.; Gallimore, J.

The Women's Health Initiative and the Million Women Study have shown that hormone replacement therapy is associated with an increased risk of incident and fatal breast cancer(2,3). In particular, synthetic progesterone derivatives (progestins) such as medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA), used in millions of women for hormone replacement therapy and contraceptives, markedly increase the risk of developing breast cancer. Here we show that the in vivo administration of MPA triggers massive induction of the key osteoclast differentiation factor RANKL (receptor activator of NF-kappa B ligand) in mammary-gland epithelial cells. Genetic inactivation of the RANKL receptor RANK in mammary-gland epithelial cells prevents MPA-induced epithelial proliferation, impairs expansion of the CD49f(hi) stem-cell-enriched population, and sensitizes these cells to DNA-damage-induced cell death. Deletion of RANK from the mammary epithelium results in a markedly decreased incidence and delayed onset of MPA-driven mammary cancer. These data show that the RANKL/RANK system controls the incidence and onset of progestin-driven breast cancer.","[Schramek, Daniel; Leibbrandt, Andreas; Sigl, Verena; Pospisilik, John A.; Hanada, Reiko; Penninger, Josef M.] Austrian Acad Sci, Inst Mol Biotechnol, IMBA, A-1030 Vienna, Austria; [Kenner, Lukas] Med Univ Vienna, A-1090 Vienna, Austria; [Lee, Heather J.; Ormandy, Christopher J.] Garvan Inst Med Res, Sydney, NSW 2010, Australia; [Joshi, Purna A.; Khokha, Rama] Univ Toronto, Ontario Canc Inst, Toronto, ON M5G 2M9, Canada; [Aliprantis, Antonios; Glimcher, Laurie] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Med, Sch Publ Hlth,Dept Immunol & Infect Dis, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Aliprantis, Antonios; Glimcher, Laurie] MGH MIT, Ragon Inst, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Pasparakis, Manolis] Univ Cologne, Ctr Mol Med CMMC, Inst Genet, D-50674 Cologne, Germany; [Pasparakis, Manolis] Univ Cologne, Cologne Excellence Cluster CECAD, D-50674 Cologne, Germany; [Widschwendter, Martin] UCL, Dept Gynaecol Oncol, London WC1E 6AU, England; [Schett, Georg] Univ Erlangen Nurnberg, Dept Internal Med 3, D-91054 Erlangen, Germany","Penninger, JM (reprint author), Austrian Acad Sci, Inst Mol Biotechnol, IMBA, A-1030 Vienna, Austria.",josef.penninger@imba.oeaw.ac.at,"; Lee, Heather/B-5302-2012; Penninger, Josef/I-6860-2013; Ormandy, Chris/G-4165-2014; Schramek, Daniel/J-5792-2014; Pasparakis, Manolis/H-9292-2017","Kenner, Lukas/0000-0003-2184-1338; Penninger, Josef/0000-0002-8194-3777; Pasparakis, Manolis/0000-0002-9870-0966; Lee, Heather/0000-0002-6482-0337","Burroughs Wellcome Fund; National Institutes of Health (NIH) [HD055601]; German Research Council (Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG)) [FOR643, SFB641, SPP1468]; Interdisciplinary Center for Clinical Sciences Erlangen; European Union (EU); National Health and Medical Research Council of Australia; Australian Cancer Research Fund; Cancer Institute New South Wales; EU InflaCare network; University College London (UCL) Hospital/UCL Comprehensive Biomedical Research Centre [152]; Department of Health National Institute for Health Research Biomedical Research Centres; Institute of Molecular Biotechnology; Austrian Ministry of Sciences; Austrian Academy of Sciences; GEN-AU (AustroMouse); European Research Council","We thank all members of our laboratories for helpful discussions; G.

Mammary glands of RANK-and RANKL-deficient mice develop normally during sexual maturation, but fail to form lobuloalveolar structures during pregnancy because of defective proliferation and increased apoptosis of mammary epithelium(3). It has been shown that RANKL is responsible for the major proliferative response of mouse mammary epithelium to progesterone during mammary lactational morphogenesis(4), and in mouse models, manipulated to induce activation of the RANK/RANKL pathway in the absence of strict hormonal control, inappropriate mammary proliferation is observed(5,6). However, there is no evidence so far of a functional contribution of RANKL to tumorigenesis. Here we show that RANK and RANKL are expressed within normal, pre-malignant and neoplastic mammary epithelium, and using complementary gain-of-function (mouse mammary tumour virus (MMTV)-RANK transgenic mice) and loss-of function (pharmacological inhibition of RANKL) approaches, define a direct contribution of this pathway in mammary tumorigenesis. Accelerated pre-neoplasias and increased mammary tumour formation were observed in MMTV-RANK transgenic mice after multiparity or treatment with carcinogen and hormone (progesterone). Reciprocally, selective pharmacological inhibition of RANKL attenuated mammary tumour development not only in hormone-and carcinogen-treated MMTV-RANK and wild-type mice, but also in the MMTV-neu transgenic spontaneous tumour model. The reduction in tumorigenesis upon RANKL inhibition was preceded by a reduction in pre-neoplasias as well as rapid and sustained reductions in hormone-and carcinogen-induced mammary epithelial proliferation and cyclin D1 levels. Collectively, our results indicate that RANKL inhibition is acting directly on hormone-induced mammary epithelium at early stages in tumorigenesis, and the permissive contribution of progesterone to increased mammary cancer incidence is due to RANKL-dependent proliferative changes in the mammary epithelium. The current study highlights a potential role for RANKL inhibition in the management of proliferative breast disease.","[Gonzalez-Suarez, Eva; Jacob, Allison P.; Jones, Jon; Miller, Robert; Erwert, Ryan; Dougall, William C.] Amgen Inc, Dept Hematol Oncol Res, Seattle, WA 98119 USA; [Roudier-Meyer, Martine P.; Branstetter, Dan] Amgen Inc, Dept Pathol, Seattle, WA 98119 USA; [Pinkas, Jan] Amgen Inc, Dept Hematol Oncol Res, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA","Dougall, WC (reprint author), Amgen Inc, Dept Hematol Oncol Res, Seattle, WA 98119 USA.",dougallw@amgen.com,"Gonzalez-Suarez, Eva/L-6298-2014","Gonzalez-Suarez, Eva/0000-0003-0858-8171",,,,28,242,250,0,32,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,4-Nov,2010,468,7320,,,,,103,+,,10.1038/nature09495,,7,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,674YF,WOS:000283786900044,20881963,No,,,11/20/17

Although angiotensinogen has long been regarded as a passive substrate, the crystal structures solved here to 2.1 angstrom resolution show that the angiotensin cleavage site is inaccessibly buried in its amino-terminal tail. The conformational rearrangement that makes this site accessible for proteolysis is revealed in our 4.4 angstrom structure of the complex of human angiotensinogen with renin. The co-ordinated changes involved are seen to be critically linked by a conserved but labile disulphide bridge. Here we show that the reduced unbridged form of angiotensinogen is present in the circulation in a near 40:60 ratio with the oxidized sulphydryl-bridged form, which preferentially interacts with receptor-bound renin. We propose that this redox-responsive transition of angiotensinogen to a form that will more effectively release angiotensin at a cellular level contributes to the modulation of blood pressure. Specifically, we demonstrate the oxidative switch of angiotensinogen to its more active sulphydryl-bridged form in the maternal circulation in pre-eclampsia-the hypertensive crisis of pregnancy that threatens the health and survival of both mother and child.","[Carrell, Robin W.; Stein, Penelope E.] Univ Cambridge, Cambridge Inst Med Res, Dept Med, Cambridge CB2 0XY, England; [Zhou, Aiwu; Wei, Zhenquan; Yan, Yahui; Stanley, Peter L.

Posttranscriptional regulation is emerging as an important component of circadian networks(2-6), but the molecular mechanisms linking the circadian clock to the control of RNA processing are largely unknown. Here we show that PROTEIN ARGININE METHYL TRANSFERASE 5 (PRMT5), which transfers methyl groups to arginine residues present in histones(7) and Sm spliceosomal proteins(8,9), links the circadian clock to the control of alternative splicing in plants. Mutations in PRMT5 impair several circadian rhythms in Arabidopsis thaliana and this phenotype is caused, at least in part, by a strong alteration in alternative splicing of the core-clock gene PSEUDO RESPONSE REGULATOR 9 (PRR9). Furthermore, genome-wide studies show that PRMT5 contributes to the regulation of many pre-messenger-RNA splicing events, probably by modulating 5'-splice-site recognition. PRMT5 expression shows daily and circadian oscillations, and this contributes to the mediation of the circadian regulation of expression and alternative splicing of a subset of genes. Circadian rhythms in locomotor activity are also disrupted in dart5-1, a mutant affected in the Drosophila melanogaster PRMT5 homologue, and this is associated with alterations in splicing of the core-clock gene period and several clock-associated genes. Our results demonstrate a key role for PRMT5 in the regulation of alternative splicing and indicate that the interplay between the circadian clock and the regulation of alternative splicing by PRMT5 constitutes a common mechanism that helps organisms to synchronize physiological processes with daily changes in environmental conditions.","[Sanchez, Sabrina E.; Rugnone, Matias L.; Hernando, C.

In many species, including humans, PK is a minor constituent of hepatic vitamin K content, with most hepatic vitamin K content comprising long-chain MKs. Menaquinone-4 (MK-4) is ubiquitously present in extrahepatic tissues, with particularly high concentrations in the brain, kidney and pancreas of humans and rats(1-3). It has consistently been shown that PK is endogenously converted to MK-4 (refs 4-8). This occurs either directly within certain tissues or by interconversion to menadione (K(3)), followed by prenylation to MK-4 (refs 9-12). No previous study has sought to identify the human enzyme responsible for MK-4 biosynthesis. Previously we provided evidence for the conversion of PK and K3 into MK-4 in mouse cerebra(13). However, the molecular mechanisms for these conversion reactions are unclear. Here we identify a human MK-4 biosynthetic enzyme. We screened the human genome database for prenylation enzymes and found UbiA prenyltransferase containing 1 (UBIAD1), a human homologue of Escherichia coli prenyltransferase menA. We found that short interfering RNA against the UBIAD1 gene inhibited the conversion of deuterium-labelled vitamin K derivatives into deuterium-labelled-MK-4 (MK-4-d(7)) in human cells. We confirmed that the UBIAD1 gene encodes an MK-4 biosynthetic enzyme through its expression and conversion of deuterium-labelled vitamin K derivatives into MK-4-d(7) in insect cells infected with UBIAD1 baculovirus. Converted MK-4-d(7) was chemically identified by (2)H-NMR analysis. MK-4 biosynthesis by UBIAD1 was not affected by the vitamin K antagonist warfarin. UBIAD1 was localized in endoplasmic reticulum and ubiquitously expressed in several tissues of mice. Our results show that UBIAD1 is a human MK-4 biosynthetic enzyme; this identification will permit more effective decisions to be made about vitamin K intake and bone health.","[Nakagawa, Kimie; Hirota, Yoshihisa; Sawada, Natsumi; Yuge, Naohito; Watanabe, Masato; Uchino, Yuri; Okuda, Naoko; Shimomura, Yuka; Suhara, Yoshitomo; Okano, Toshio] Kobe Pharmaceut Univ, Dept Hyg Sci, Higashinada Ku, Kobe, Hyogo 6588558, Japan","Okano, T (reprint author), Kobe Pharmaceut Univ, Dept Hyg Sci, Higashinada Ku, 4-19-1 Motoyamakita Machi, Kobe, Hyogo 6588558, Japan.",t-okano@kobepharma-u.ac.jp,,,"Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology","We thank M.

Here we present results of the pilot phase of the project, designed to develop and compare different strategies for genome-wide sequencing with high-throughput platforms. We undertook three projects: low-coverage whole-genome sequencing of 179 individuals from four populations; high-coverage sequencing of two mother-father-child trios; and exon-targeted sequencing of 697 individuals from seven populations. We describe the location, allele frequency and local haplotype structure of approximately 15 million single nucleotide polymorphisms, 1 million short insertions and deletions, and 20,000 structural variants, most of which were previously undescribed. We show that, because we have catalogued the vast majority of common variation, over 95% of the currently accessible variants found in any individual are present in this data set. On average, each person is found to carry approximately 250 to 300 loss-of-function variants in annotated genes and 50 to 100 variants previously implicated in inherited disorders. We demonstrate how these results can be used to inform association and functional studies. From the two trios, we directly estimate the rate of de novo germline base substitution mutations to be approximately 10(-8) per base pair per generation. We explore the data with regard to signatures of natural selection, and identify a marked reduction of genetic variation in the neighbourhood of genes, due to selection at linked sites. These methods and public data will support the next phase of human genetic research.","[Gabriel, Stacey B.; Lander, Eric S.; Lander, Eric S.; Ambrogio, Lauren; Cibulskis, Kristian; Fennell, Tim J.; Jaffe, David B.; Shefler, Erica; Sougnez, Carrie L.; Daly, Mark J.; DePristo, Mark A.; Ball, Aaron D.; Banks, Eric; Bloom, Toby; Cibulskis, Kristian; Fennell, Tim J.; Garimella, Kiran V.; Handsaker, Robert E.; Hanna, Matt; Hartl, Chris; Jaffe, David B.; Kernytsky, Andrew M.; Korn, Joshua M.; Li, Heng; Maguire, Jared R.; McCarroll, Steven A.; McKenna, Aaron; Nemesh, James C.; Philippakis, Anthony A.; Poplin, Ryan E.; Rivas, Manuel A.; Sabeti, Pardis C.; Schaffner, Stephen F.; Fu, Yutao; Banks, Eric; DePristo, Mark A.; Hartl, Chris; Korn, Joshua M.; Nemesh, James C.; Garimella, Kiran V.; Sougnez, Carrie L.; Wilkinson, Jane; Altshuler, David L.] Broad Inst MIT & Harvard, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; [Churcher, Carol; Coffey, Alison; Cox, Anthony; Palotie, Aarno; Tyler-Smith, Chris; Coffey, Allison; Palotie, Aarno; Scott, Carol; Tyler-Smith, Chris] Wellcome Trust Sanger Inst, Cambridge CB10 1SA, England; Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Ctr Human Genet Res, Boston, MA 02114 USA; [Altshuler, David L.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Genet, Cambridge, MA 02115 USA; [Abecasis, Goncalo R.; Korbel, Jan O.; Li, Yun; Anderson, Paul; Chen, Wei; Ding, Jun; Kang, Hyun Min; Sidore, Carlo; Snyder, Matthew; Zhan, Xiaowei; Zoellner, Sebastian; Blackwell, Tom; Snyder, Matthew] Univ Michigan, Ctr Stat Genet & Biostat, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Bentley, David R.; Gormley, Niall; Humphray, Sean; Kingsbury, Zoya; Koko-Gonzales, Paula; Stone, Jennifer; Timmermann, Bernd; Bauer, Markus; Cheetham, R.

Here we determine the crystal structure of a bacterial homologue (Haemophilus influenzae) of SLAC1 at 1.20 angstrom resolution, and use structure-inspired mutagenesis to analyse the conductance properties of SLAC1 channels. SLAC1 is a symmetrical trimer composed from quasi-symmetrical subunits, each having ten transmembrane helices arranged from helical hairpin pairs to form a central five-helix transmembrane pore that is gated by an extremely conserved phenylalanine residue. Conformational features indicate a mechanism for control of gating by kinase activation, and electrostatic features of the pore coupled with electrophysiological characteristics indicate that selectivity among different anions is largely a function of the energetic cost of ion dehydration.","[Chen, Yu-hang; Rost, Burkhard; Hendrickson, Wayne A.] Columbia Univ, Dept Biochem & Mol Biophys, New York, NY 10032 USA; [Chen, Yu-hang; Punta, Marco; Bruni, Renato; Hillerich, Brandan; Kloss, Brian; Rost, Burkhard; Love, James; Hendrickson, Wayne A.] New York Struct Biol Ctr, NYCOMPS, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Hu, Lei; Siegelbaum, Steven A.] Columbia Univ, Dept Neurosci, New York, NY 10032 USA; [Punta, Marco; Rost, Burkhard] Tech Univ Munich, Dept Comp Sci, D-85748 Munich, Germany; [Punta, Marco; Rost, Burkhard] Tech Univ Munich, Inst Adv Study, D-85748 Munich, Germany; [Siegelbaum, Steven A.] Columbia Univ, Dept Pharmacol, New York, NY 10032 USA; [Siegelbaum, Steven A.; Hendrickson, Wayne A.] Columbia Univ, Howard Hughes Med Inst, New York, NY 10032 USA; [Hendrickson, Wayne A.] Columbia Univ, Dept Physiol & Cellular Biophys, New York, NY 10032 USA","Hendrickson, WA (reprint author), Columbia Univ, Dept Biochem & Mol Biophys, 630 W 168th St, New York, NY 10032 USA.",wayne@convex.hhmi.columbia.edu,"Hu, Lei/B-1455-2009",,New York Consortium on Membrane Protein Structure (NYCOMPS) from the NIGMS Protein Structure Initiative,"We thank F.

Measurements of the masses or radii of these objects can strongly constrain the neutron star matter equation of state and rule out theoretical models of their composition(1,2). The observed range of neutron star masses, however, has hitherto been too narrow to rule out many predictions of 'exotic' non-nucleonic components(3-6). The Shapiro delay is a general-relativistic increase in light travel time through the curved space-time near a massive body(7). For highly inclined (nearly edge-on) binary millisecond radio pulsar systems, this effect allows us to infer the masses of both the neutron star and its binary companion to high precision(8,9). Here we present radio timing observations of the binary millisecond pulsar J1614-2230(10,11) that show a strong Shapiro delay signature. We calculate the pulsar mass to be (1.97 +/- 0.04) M(circle dot), which rules out almost all currently proposed(2-5) hyperon or boson condensate equations of state (M(circle dot), solar mass). Quark matter can support a star this massive only if the quarks are strongly interacting and are therefore not 'free' quarks(12).","[Demorest, P. B.; Ransom, S.

Moreover, it provides a perfect model system for the atomic-scale investigation of fundamental effects such as magnetism in dilute magnetic semiconductors(4). However, dopants in semiconductors so far have not been studied by magnetically sensitive techniques with atomic resolution that correlate the atomic structure with the dopant's magnetism. Here we show electrical excitation and read-out of a spin associated with a single magnetic dopant in a semiconductor host. We use spin-resolved scanning tunnelling spectroscopy to measure the spin excitations and the magnetization curve of individual iron surface-dopants embedded within a two-dimensional electron gas confined to an indium antimonide (110) surface. The dopants act like isolated quantum spins the states of which are governed by a substantial magnetic anisotropy that forces the spin to lie in the surface plane. This result is corroborated by our first principles calculations. The demonstrated methodology opens new routes for the investigation of sample systems that are more widely studied in the field of spintronics-that is, Mn in GaAs (ref. 5), magnetic ions in semiconductor quantum dots(3), nitrogen-vacancy centres in diamond(6) and phosphorus spins in silicon(7).","[Khajetoorians, Alexander A.; Chilian, Bruno; Wiebe, Jens; Wiesendanger, Roland] Univ Hamburg, Inst Appl Phys, D-20355 Hamburg, Germany; [Schuwalow, Sergej; Lechermann, Frank] Univ Hamburg, Inst Theoret Phys 1, D-20355 Hamburg, Germany","Wiebe, J (reprint author), Univ Hamburg, Inst Appl Phys, Jungiusstr 11, D-20355 Hamburg, Germany.",jwiebe@physnet.uni-hamburg.de,"Lechermann, Frank/K-4745-2013; Khajetoorians, Alexander/F-9698-2015; Wiesendanger, Roland/P-9726-2016","Wiesendanger, Roland/0000-0002-0472-4183",ERC; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft [SFB668]; Graduiertenkolleg [1286]; City of Hamburg via the cluster of excellence,"J.W. would like to thank M.

The ratio of phosphorus to iron in iron-oxide-rich sedimentary rocks can be used to track dissolved phosphate concentrations if the dissolved silica concentration of sea water is estimated(2-5). Here we present iron and phosphorus concentration ratios from distal hydrothermal sediments and iron formations through time to study the evolution of the marine phosphate reservoir. The data suggest that phosphate concentrations have been relatively constant over the Phanerozoic eon, the past 542 million years (Myr) of Earth's history. In contrast, phosphate concentrations seem to have been elevated in Precambrian oceans. Specifically, there is a peak in phosphorus-to-iron ratios in Neoproterozoic iron formations dating from 750 to 635 Myr ago, indicating unusually high dissolved phosphate concentrations in the aftermath of widespread, low-latitude 'snowball Earth' glaciations. An enhanced postglacial phosphate flux would have caused high rates of primary productivity and organic carbon burial and a transition to more oxidizing conditions in the ocean and atmosphere. The snowball Earth glaciations and Neoproterozoic oxidation are both suggested as triggers for the evolution and radiation of metazoans(6,7). We propose that these two factors are intimately linked; a glacially induced nutrient surplus could have led to an increase in atmospheric oxygen, paving the way for the rise of metazoan life.","[Planavsky, Noah J.; Reinhard, Christopher T.; Lyons, Timothy W.] Univ Calif Riverside, Dept Earth Sci, Riverside, CA 92521 USA; [Planavsky, Noah J.; Rouxel, Olivier J.] Woods Hole Oceanog Inst, Dept Marine Chem & Geochem, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA; [Rouxel, Olivier J.] Univ Europeene Bretagne, European Inst Marine Studies, F-29280 Plouzane, France; [Bekker, Andrey] Univ Manitoba, Dept Geol Sci, Winnipeg, MB R3T 2N2, Canada; [Lalonde, Stefan V.; Konhauser, Kurt O.] Univ Alberta, Dept Earth & Atmospher Sci, Edmonton, AB T6G 2E3, Canada","Lyons, TW (reprint author), Univ Calif Riverside, Dept Earth Sci, Riverside, CA 92521 USA.",timothy.lyons@ucr.edu,"Reinhard, Christopher/A-1736-2011; Rouxel, Olivier/F-3954-2014; Lalonde, Stefan/I-8879-2014","Lalonde, Stefan/0000-0003-1318-2280; Konhauser, Kurt/0000-0001-7722-7068; Rouxel, Olivier/0000-0002-1431-222X",NSF; NASA Astrobiology Institute; NASA; NSF-EAR; NSERC; NSF-OCE; NSF-GSF,"This work was supported by funding from the NSF-GSF program and the NASA Astrobiology Institute, to N.J.P.; from the NASA Exobiology Program and the NSF-EAR, to T.

This is probably due to deformation-induced alignment of MgSiO(3)-post-perovskite (ppv), which is believed to be the main mineral phase present in the region. If this is the case, then previous measurements of D '' anisotropy, which are generally made in one direction only, are insufficient to distinguish candidate mechanisms of slip in ppv because the mineral is orthorhombic. Here we measure anisotropy in D '' beneath North and Central America, where material from subducting oceanic slabs impinges(6) on the core-mantle boundary, using shallow as well as deep earthquakes to increase the azimuthal coverage in D ''. We make more than 700 individual measurements of shear wave splitting in D '' in three regions from two different azimuths in each case. We show that the previously assumed(2,3,7) case of vertical transverse isotropy (where wave speed shows no azimuthal variation) is not possible, and that more complicated mechanisms must be involved. We test the fit of different MgSiO(3)-ppv deformation mechanisms to our results and find that shear on (001) is most consistent with observations and the expected shear above the core-mantle boundary beneath subduction zones. With new models of mantle flow, or improved experimental determination of the dominant ppv slip systems, this method will allow us to map deformation at the core-mantle boundary and link processes in D '', such as plume initiation, to the rest of the mantle.","[Nowacki, Andy; Wookey, James; Kendall, J-Michael] Univ Bristol, Dept Earth Sci, Bristol BS8 1RJ, Avon, England","Nowacki, A (reprint author), Univ Bristol, Dept Earth Sci, Wills Mem Bldg,Queens Rd, Bristol BS8 1RJ, Avon, England.",andy.nowacki@bristol.ac.uk,"Nowacki, Andy/E-1106-2011; Wookey, James/G-6113-2011","Nowacki, Andy/0000-0001-7669-7383; ",NERC,"We thank J.

Some prefer an ancient (Cretaceous) origin for anthropoids in Africa or some other Gondwanan landmass(4), whereas others advocate a more recent (early Cenozoic) origin for anthropoids in Asia(1,2,5), with subsequent dispersal of one or more early anthropoid taxa to Africa. The oldest undoubted African anthropoid primates described so far are three species of the parapithecid Biretia from the late middle Eocene Bir El Ater locality of Algeria(6) and the late Eocene BQ-2 site in the Fayum region of northern Egypt(7). Here we report the discovery of the oldest known diverse assemblage of African anthropoids from the late middle Eocene Dur At-Talah escarpment in central Libya. The primate assemblage from Dur At-Talah includes diminutive species pertaining to three higher-level anthropoid clades (Afrotarsiidae, Parapithecidae and Oligopithecidae) as well as a small species of the early strepsirhine primate Karanisia. The high taxonomic diversity of anthropoids at Dur At-Talah indicates either a much longer interval of anthropoid evolution in Africa than is currently documented in the fossil record or the nearly synchronous colonization of Africa by multiple anthropoid clades at some time during the middle Eocene epoch.","[Jaeger, Jean-Jacques; Benammi, Mouloud; Coster, Pauline; Schuster, Mathieu; Valentin, Xavier; Brunet, Michel] Univ Poitiers, Inst Int Paleoprimatol & Paleontol Humaine, CNRS, UMR 6046, F-86022 Poitiers, France; [Beard, K.

Recently, high-resolution recombination maps were inferred from high-density single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data using linkage disequilibrium (LD) patterns that capture historical recombination events(1,2). The use of these maps has been demonstrated by the identification of recombination hotspots(2) and associated motifs(3), and the discovery that the PRDM(9) gene affects the proportion of recombinations occurring at hotspots(4-6). However, these maps provide no information about individual or sex differences. Moreover, locus-specific demographic factors like natural selection(7) can bias LD-based estimates of recombination rate. Existing genetic maps based on family data avoid these shortcomings(8), but their resolution is limited by relatively few meioses and a low density of markers. Here we used genome-wide SNP data from(15),257 parent-offspring pairs to construct the first recombination maps based on directly observed recombinations with a resolution that is effective down to 10 kilobases (kb). Comparing male and female maps reveals that about 15% of hot-spots in one sex are specific to that sex. Although male recombinations result in more shuffling of exons within genes, female recombinations generate more new combinations of nearby genes. We discover novel associations between recombination characteristics of individuals and variants in the PRDM9 gene and we identify new recombination hotspots. Comparisons of our maps with two LD-based maps inferred from data of HapMap populations of Utah residents with ancestry from northern and western Europe (CEU) and Yoruba in Ibadan, Nigeria (YRI) reveal population differences previously masked by noise and map differences at regions previously described as targets of natural selection.","[Kong, Augustine; Thorleifsson, Gudmar; Gudbjartsson, Daniel F.; Masson, Gisli; Sigurdsson, Asgeir; Jonasdottir, Aslaug; Walters, G.

The brain must select one or more of these for further processing. How this competition is resolved across multiple sensory and cognitive regions is not known; nor is it clear how internal thoughts and attention regulate this competition(1-4). Recording from single neurons in patients implanted with intracranial electrodes for clinical reasons(5-9), here we demonstrate that humans can regulate the activity of their neurons in the medial temporal lobe (MTL) to alter the outcome of the contest between external images and their internal representation. Subjects looked at a hybrid superposition of two images representing familiar individuals, landmarks, objects or animals and had to enhance one image at the expense of the other, competing one. Simultaneously, the spiking activity of their MTL neurons in different subregions and hemispheres was decoded in real time to control the content of the hybrid. Subjects reliably regulated, often on the first trial, the firing rate of their neurons, increasing the rate of some while simultaneously decreasing the rate of others. They did so by focusing onto one image, which gradually became clearer on the computer screen in front of their eyes, and thereby overriding sensory input. On the basis of the firing of these MTL neurons, the dynamics of the competition between visual images in the subject's mind was visualized on an external display.","[Cerf, Moran; Thiruvengadam, Nikhil; Mormann, Florian; Kraskov, Alexander; Quiroga, Rodrigo Quian; Koch, Christof] CALTECH, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA; [Cerf, Moran; Fried, Itzhak] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Neurosurg, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Cerf, Moran] NYU, Stern Sch Business, New York, NY 10012 USA; [Thiruvengadam, Nikhil] Carnegie Mellon Univ, Sch Comp Sci, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA; [Mormann, Florian] Univ Bonn, Dept Epileptol, D-53105 Bonn, Germany; [Quiroga, Rodrigo Quian] Univ Leicester, Dept Engn, Leicester LE1 7RH, Leics, England; [Koch, Christof] Korea Univ, Dept Brain & Cognit Engn, Seoul 136713, South Korea; [Fried, Itzhak] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Semel Inst Neurosci & Human Behav, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Fried, Itzhak] Tel Aviv Med Ctr & Sch Med, Funct Neurosurg Unit, IL-64239 Tel Aviv, Israel; [Fried, Itzhak] Tel Aviv Univ, Sackler Fac Med, IL-69978 Tel Aviv, Israel","Cerf, M (reprint author), CALTECH, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA.",moran@klab.caltech.edu; koch@klab.caltech.edu; ifried@mednet.ucla.edu,"Kraskov, Alexander/J-7964-2012; Mormann, Florian/K-1582-2014","Mormann, Florian/0000-0003-1305-8028; Kraskov, Alexander/0000-0002-3576-4719; Koch, Christof/0000-0001-6482-8067","National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS); National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH); G.

Previous studies indicate that this disease has a complex genomic landscape, with frequent copy number changes and point mutations(1-5), but genomic rearrangements have not been characterized in detail. Despite the clinical importance of metastasis, there remain fundamental questions about the clonal structures of metastatic tumours(6,7), including phylogenetic relationships among metastases, the scale of ongoing parallel evolution in metastatic and primary sites(7), and how the tumour disseminates. Here we harness advances in DNA sequencing(8-12) to annotate genomic rearrangements in 13 patients with pancreatic cancer and explore clonal relationships among metastases. We find that pancreatic cancer acquires rearrangements indicative of telomere dysfunction and abnormal cell-cycle control, namely dysregulated G1-to-S-phase transition with intact G2-M checkpoint. These initiate amplification of cancer genes and occur predominantly in early cancer development rather than the later stages of the disease. Genomic instability frequently persists after cancer dissemination, resulting in ongoing, parallel and even convergent evolution among different metastases. We find evidence that there is genetic heterogeneity among metastasis-initiating cells, that seeding metastasis may require driver mutations beyond those required for primary tumours, and that phylogenetic trees across metastases show organ-specific branches. These data attest to the richness of genetic variation in cancer, brought about by the tandem forces of genomic instability and evolutionary selection.","[Campbell, Peter J.; Mudie, Laura J.; Stephens, Philip J.; Pleasance, Erin D.; Stebbings, Lucy A.; Latimer, Calli; McLaren, Stuart; Lin, Meng-Lay; McBride, David J.; Varela, Ignacio; Nik-Zainal, Serena A.; Leroy, Catherine; Jia, Mingming; Menzies, Andrew; Butler, Adam P.; Teague, Jon W.; Burton, John; Swerdlow, Harold; Quail, Michael A.; Stratton, Michael R.; Futreal, P.

This is particularly true for pancreatic cancers, where most patients are diagnosed with metastatic disease and few show a sustained response to chemotherapy or radiation therapy(3). Whether the dismal prognosis of patients with pancreatic cancer compared to patients with other types of cancer is a result of late diagnosis or early dissemination of disease to distant organs is not known. Here we rely on data generated by sequencing the genomes of seven pancreatic cancer metastases to evaluate the clonal relationships among primary and metastatic cancers. We find that clonal populations that give rise to distant metastases are represented within the primary carcinoma, but these clones are genetically evolved from the original parental, non-metastatic clone. Thus, genetic heterogeneity of metastases reflects that within the primary carcinoma. A quantitative analysis of the timing of the genetic evolution of pancreatic cancer was performed, indicating at least a decade between the occurrence of the initiating mutation and the birth of the parental, non-metastatic founder cell. At least five more years are required for the acquisition of metastatic ability and patients die an average of two years thereafter.

SEMA4D and Sema6A exemplify two diverse vertebrate, membrane-spanning semaphorin classes (4 and 6) that are capable of direct signalling through members of the two largest plexin classes, B and A, respectively(2,3). In the absence of any structural information on the plexin ectodomain or its interaction with semaphorins the extracellular specificity and mechanism controlling plexin signalling has remained unresolved. Here we present crystal structures of cognate complexes of the semaphorin-binding regions of plexins B1 and A2 with semaphorin ectodomains (human PLXNB1(1-2)-SEMA4D(ecto) and murine PlxnA2(1-4)-Sema6A(ecto)), plus unliganded structures of PlxnA2(1-4) and Sema6A(ecto). These structures, together with biophysical and cellular assays of wild-type and mutant proteins, reveal that semaphorin dimers independently bind two plexin molecules and that signalling is critically dependent on the avidity of the resulting bivalent 2: 2 complex (monomeric semaphorin binds plexin but fails to trigger signalling). In combination, our data favour a cell-cell signalling mechanism involving semaphorin-stabilized plexin dimerization, possibly followed by clustering, which is consistent with previous functional data. Furthermore, the shared generic architecture of the complexes, formed through conserved contacts of the amino-terminal seven-bladed beta-propeller (sema) domains of both semaphorin and plexin, suggests that a common mode of interaction triggers all semaphorin-plexin based signalling, while distinct insertions within or between blades of the sema domains determine binding specificity.","[Janssen, Bert J.

The binding of soluble or membrane-anchored semaphorins to the membrane-distal region of the plexin ecto-domain activates plexin's intrinsic GTPase-activating protein (GAP) at the cytoplasmic region, ultimately modulating cellular adhesion behaviour(5). However, the structural mechanism underlying the receptor activation remains largely unknown. Here we report the crystal structures of the semaphorin 6A (Sema6A) receptor-binding fragment and the plexin A2 (PlxnA2) ligand-binding fragment in both their pre-signalling (that is, before binding) and signalling (after complex formation) states. Before binding, the Sema6A ectodomain was in the expected 'face-to-face' homodimer arrangement, similar to that adopted by Sema3A and Sema4D, whereas PlxnA2 was in an unexpected 'head-on' homodimer arrangement. In contrast, the structure of the Sema6A-PlxnA2 signalling complex revealed a 2:2 heterotetramer in which the two PlxnA2 monomers dissociated from one another and docked onto the top face of the Sema6A homodimer using the same interface as the head-on homodimer, indicating that plexins undergo 'partner exchange'. Cell-based activity measurements using mutant ligands/receptors confirmed that the Sema6A face-to-face dimer arrangement is physiologically relevant and is maintained throughout signalling events. Thus, homodimer-to-heterodimer transitions of cell-surface plexin that result in a specific orientation of its molecular axis relative to the membrane may constitute the structural mechanism by which the ligand-binding 'signal' is transmitted to the cytoplasmic region, inducing GAP domain rearrangements and activation.","[Nogi, Terukazu; Yasui, Norihisa; Mihara, Emiko; Matsunaga, Yukiko; Takagi, Junichi] Osaka Univ, Inst Prot Res, Lab Prot Synth & Express, Suita, Osaka 5650871, Japan; [Noda, Masanori; Uchiyama, Susumu] Osaka Univ, Grad Sch Engn, Dept Biotechnol, Suita, Osaka 5650871, Japan; [Yamashita, Naoya; Goshima, Yoshio] Yokohama City Univ, Grad Sch Med, Dept Mol Pharmacol & Neurobiol, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2360004, Japan; [Toyofuku, Toshihiko; Kumanogoh, Atsushi] Osaka Univ, Microbial Dis Res Inst, Immunol Frontier Res Ctr, Dept Immunopathol, Suita, Osaka 5650871, Japan","Takagi, J (reprint author), Osaka Univ, Inst Prot Res, Lab Prot Synth & Express, 3-2 Yamadaoka, Suita, Osaka 5650871, Japan.",takagi@protein.osaka-u.ac.jp,"UCHIYAMA, Susumu/F-9590-2017","UCHIYAMA, Susumu/0000-0002-5181-179X; Yasui, Norihisa/0000-0001-7117-3070","Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology of Japan (MEXT)","We would like to thank Y.

This repression is thought to involve heterochromatin formation and transcriptional and post-transcriptional silencing(1-6). The piRNA pathway has other essential functions in germline stem cell maintenance(7) and in maintaining germline DNA integrity(8-10). Here we uncover an unexpected function of the piRNA pathway in the decay of maternal messenger RNAs and in translational repression in the early embryo. A subset of maternal mRNAs is degraded in the embryo at the maternal-to-zygotic transition. In Drosophila, maternal mRNA degradation depends on the RNA-binding protein Smaug and the deadenylase CCR4(11-13), as well as the zygotic expression of a microRNA cluster(14). Using mRNA encoding the embryonic posterior morphogen Nanos (Nos) as a paradigm to study maternal mRNA decay, we found that CCR4-mediated deadenylation of nos depends on components of the piRNA pathway including piRNAs complementary to a specific region in the nos 3' untranslated region. Reduced deadenylation when piRNA-induced regulation is impaired correlates with nos mRNA stabilization and translational derepression in the embryo, resulting in head development defects. Aubergine, one of the Argonaute proteins in the piRNA pathway, is present in a complex with Smaug, CCR4, nos mRNA and piRNAs that target the nos 3' untranslated region, in the bulk of the embryo. We propose that piRNAs and their associated proteins act together with Smaug to recruit the CCR4 deadenylation complex to specific mRNAs, thus promoting their decay. Because the piRNAs involved in this regulation are produced from transposable elements, this identifies a direct developmental function for transposable elements in the regulation of gene expression.","[Rouget, Christel; Papin, Catherine; Meunier, Anne-Cecile; Franco, Benedicte; Simonelig, Martine] CNRS, UPR1142, Inst Human Genet, mRNA Regulat & Dev, F-34396 Montpellier 5, France; [Boureux, Anthony] Univ Montpellier 2, CNRS, UMR5237, CRBM, F-34293 Montpellier, France; [Robine, Nicolas; Lai, Eric C.] Sloan Kettering Inst, Dept Dev Biol, Rockefeller Res Labs 1017, New York, NY 10065 USA; [Pelisson, Alain] CNRS, UPR1142, Inst Human Genet, RNA Silencing & Control Transposit, F-34396 Montpellier 5, France","Simonelig, M (reprint author), CNRS, UPR1142, Inst Human Genet, mRNA Regulat & Dev, 141 Rue Cardonille, F-34396 Montpellier 5, France.",Martine.Simonelig@igh.cnrs.fr,,"Robine, Nicolas/0000-0001-5698-8183",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique [UPR1142]; Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR Blanche) [ANR-06-BLAN-0343]; Fondation pour la Recherche Medicale (FRM); Association pour la Recherche sur le Cancer (ARC); National Institutes of Health (NIH) [R01-GM083300],"We are grateful to A.

We used single-molecule fluorescence to monitor the effect of Mss116 on folding dynamics of a minimal active construct, ai5 gamma-D135. The data show that Mss116 stimulates dynamic sampling between states along the folding pathway, an effect previously observed only with high Mg(2+) concentrations. Furthermore, the data indicate that Mss116 promotes folding through discrete ATP-independent and ATP-dependent steps.

Energetic photons emitted by young, massive stars in primeval galaxies ionized the intergalactic medium surrounding their host galaxies, cleared sight-lines along which the light of the young galaxies could escape, and fundamentally altered the physical state of the intergalactic gas in the Universe continuously until the present day(1,2). Observations of the cosmic microwave background(3), and of galaxies and quasars at the highest redshifts(4), suggest that the Universe was reionized through a complex process that was completed about a billion years after the Big Bang, by redshift z approximate to 6. Detecting ionizing Lyman-alpha photons from increasingly distant galaxies places important constraints on the timing, location and nature of the sources responsible for reionization. Here we report the detection of Ly alpha photons emitted less than 600 million years after the Big Bang. UDFy-38135539 (ref. 5) is at a redshift of z = 8.5549 +/- 0.0002, which is greater than those of the previously known most distant objects, at z = 8.2 (refs 6 and 7) and z = 6.96 (ref. 8).

Although generally not visible, the diffuse auroral precipitation provides the main source of energy for the high-latitude nightside upper atmosphere(3), leading to enhanced ionization and chemical changes. Previous theoretical studies have indicated that two distinct classes of magnetospheric plasma wave, electrostatic electron cyclotron harmonic waves(4,5) and whistler-mode chorus waves(6,7), could be responsible for the electron scattering that leads to diffuse auroral precipitation, but it has hitherto not been possible to determine which is the more important. Here we report an analysis of satellite wave data and Fokker-Planck diffusion calculations which reveals that scattering by chorus is the dominant cause of the most intense diffuse auroral precipitation. This resolves a long-standing controversy. Furthermore, scattering by chorus can remove most electrons as they drift around Earth's magnetosphere, leading to the development of observed pancake distributions(8), and can account for the global morphology of the diffuse aurora(1,3).","[Thorne, Richard M.; Ni, Binbin; Tao, Xin] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Atmospher & Ocean Sci, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Horne, Richard B.; Meredith, Nigel P.] British Antarctic Survey, Cambridge CB3 0ET, England; [Horne, Richard B.] Univ Sheffield, Dept Automat Control & Syst Engn, Sheffield S1 3JD, S Yorkshire, England","Thorne, RM (reprint author), Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Atmospher & Ocean Sci, 405 Hilgard Ave, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.",rmt@atmos.ucla.edu,"Ni, Binbin/I-5244-2013","Horne, Richard/0000-0002-0412-6407; Meredith, Nigel/0000-0001-5032-3463",NSF [ATM 0802843]; UK Natural Environment Research Council,This work was funded in part by NSF grant ATM 0802843 and by the UK Natural Environment Research Council.

The effect is widely used to separate macromolecules, to assemble colloidal structures and to transport particles in nano- and microfluidic devices and displays(2-4). Typically, the fluid is isotropic (for example, water) and the electrophoretic velocity is linearly proportional to the electric field. In linear electrophoresis, only a direct-current (d.c.) field can drive the particles. An alternating-current (a.c.) field is more desirable because it makes it possible to overcome problems such as electrolysis and the absence of steady flows(5,6). Here we show that when the electrophoresis is performed in a liquid-crystalline nematic fluid, the effect becomes strongly nonlinear, with a velocity component that is quadratic in the applied voltage and has a direction that generally differs from the direction of linear velocity. The new phenomenon is caused by distortions of the liquid-crystal orientation around the particle that break the fore-aft (or left-right) symmetry. The effect makes it possible to transport both charged and neutral particles, even when the particles themselves are perfectly symmetric (spherical), thus allowing new approaches in display technologies, colloidal assembly and separation, microfluidic and micromotor applications.","[Lavrentovich, Oleg D.; Lazo, Israel; Pishnyak, Oleg P.] Kent State Univ, Inst Liquid Crystal, Kent, OH 44242 USA; [Lavrentovich, Oleg D.; Lazo, Israel; Pishnyak, Oleg P.] Kent State Univ, Chem Phys Interdisciplinary Program, Kent, OH 44242 USA","Lavrentovich, OD (reprint author), Kent State Univ, Inst Liquid Crystal, Kent, OH 44242 USA.",olavrent@kent.edu,"Lavrentovich, Oleg/B-4996-2011",,NSF [DMR 0906751],We are grateful to L.

Climate change is expected to intensify the hydrological cycle(2) and to alter evapotranspiration, with implications for ecosystem services and feedback to regional and global climate. Evapotranspiration changes may already be under way, but direct observational constraints are lacking at the global scale. Until such evidence is available, changes in the water cycle on land-a key diagnostic criterion of the effects of climate change and variability-remain uncertain. Here we provide a data-driven estimate of global land evapotranspiration from 1982 to 2008, compiled using a global monitoring network(3), meteorological and remote-sensing observations, and a machine-learning algorithm(4). In addition, we have assessed evapotranspiration variations over the same time period using an ensemble of process-based land-surface-models. Our results suggest that global annual evapotranspiration increased on average by 7.1 +/- 1.0 millimetres per year per decade from 1982 to 1997. After that, coincident with the last major El Nino event in 1998, the global evapotranspiration increase seems to have ceased until 2008. This change was driven primarily by moisture limitation in the Southern Hemisphere, particularly Africa and Australia. In these regions, microwave satellite observations indicate that soil moisture decreased from 1998 to 2008. Hence, increasing soil-moisture limitations on evapotranspiration largely explain the recent decline of the global land-evapotranspiration trend. Whether the changing behaviour of evapotranspiration is representative of natural climate variability or reflects a more permanent reorganization of the land water cycle is a key question for earth system science.","[Jung, Martin; Reichstein, Markus; Tomelleri, Enrico; Weber, Ulrich; Zaehle, Soenke] Max Planck Inst Biogeochem, D-07745 Jena, Germany; [Ciais, Philippe; Viovy, Nicolas] CNRS, CEA, LSCE, F-91191 Gif Sur Yvette, France; [Ciais, Philippe; Viovy, Nicolas] UVSQ, F-91191 Gif Sur Yvette, France; [Seneviratne, Sonia I.; Mueller, Brigitte] ETH, Inst Atmospher & Climate Sci, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland; [Sheffield, Justin; Wood, Eric] Princeton Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Goulden, Michael L.] Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Earth Syst Sci, Irvine, CA 92697 USA; [Bonan, Gordon; Oleson, Keith] Natl Ctr Atmospher Res, Boulder, CO 80307 USA; [Cescatti, Alessandro] Commiss European Communities, Directorate Gen Joint Res Ctr, Inst Environm & Sustainabil, Climate Change Unit, I-21027 Ispra, VA, Italy; [Chen, Jiquan] Univ Toledo, Dept Environm Sci, Toledo, OH 43606 USA; [de Jeu, Richard; Dolman, A.

This carbon isotope excursion (CIE) is consistent with the release of a massive amount of isotopically light carbon into the atmosphere and was associated with a dramatic rise in global temperatures termed the Palaeocene-Eocene thermal maximum (PETM). Greenhouse gases released during the CIE, probably including methane, have often been considered the main cause of PETM warming. However, some evidence from the marine record suggests that warming directly preceded the CIE(2-4), raising the possibility that the CIE and PETM may have been linked to earlier warming with different origins. Yet pre-CIE warming is still uncertain. Disentangling the sequence of events before and during the CIE and PETM is important for understanding the causes of, and Earth system responses to, abrupt climate change. Here we show that continental warming of about 5 degrees C preceded the CIE in the Bighorn Basin, Wyoming. Our evidence, based on oxygen isotopes in mammal teeth (which reflect temperature-sensitive fractionation processes) and other proxies, reveals a marked temperature increase directly below the CIE, and again in the CIE. Pre-CIE warming is also supported by a negative amplification of delta(13)C values in soil carbonates below the CIE. Our results suggest that at least two sources of warming-the earlier of which is unlikely to have been methane-contributed to the PETM.","[Secord, Ross] Univ Nebraska, Dept Earth & Atmospher Sci, Lincoln, NE 68588 USA; [Secord, Ross; Gingerich, Philip D.; Lohmann, Kyger C.] Univ Michigan, Dept Geol Sci, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Secord, Ross] Florida Museum Nat Hist, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [MacLeod, Kenneth G.] Univ Missouri, Dept Geol Sci, Columbia, MO 65211 USA","Secord, R (reprint author), Univ Nebraska, Dept Earth & Atmospher Sci, Lincoln, NE 68588 USA.",rsecord2@unl.edu,"Gingerich, Philip/A-6903-2008; Rastelli, Marcio/B-8034-2011; MacLeod, Kenneth/C-4042-2017","Gingerich, Philip/0000-0002-1550-2674; MacLeod, Kenneth/0000-0002-6016-0837",American Chemical Society; National Science Foundation; Geological Society of America; University of Michigan Department of Geological Sciences,"We thank D.

However, although many species' ranges have shifted in historical times, many others have not, or have shifted only at the high-latitude or high-elevation limits, leading to range expansions rather than contractions(5-11). Given these idiosyncratic responses to climate warming, and their varied implications for species' vulnerability to climate change, a critical task is to understand why some species have not shifted their ranges, particularly at the equatorial or low-elevation limits, and whether such resilience will last as warming continues. Here we show that compensatory changes in demographic rates are buffering southern populations of two North American tundra plants against the negative effects of a warming climate, slowing their northward range shifts, but that this buffering is unlikely to continue indefinitely. Southern populations of both species showed lower survival and recruitment but higher growth of individual plants, possibly owing to longer, warmer growing seasons. Because of these and other compensatory changes, the population growth rates of southern populations are not at present lower than those of northern ones. However, continued warming may yet prove detrimental, as most demographic rates that improved in moderately warmer years declined in the warmest years, with the potential to drive future population declines. Our results emphasize the need for long-term, range-wide measurement of all population processes to detect demographic compensation and to identify nonlinear responses that may lead to sudden range shifts as climatic tipping points are exceeded.","[Doak, Daniel F.] Univ Wyoming, Dept Zool & Physiol, Laramie, WY 82071 USA; [Morris, William F.] Duke Univ, Dept Biol, Durham, NC 27708 USA","Doak, DF (reprint author), Univ Wyoming, Dept Zool & Physiol, Laramie, WY 82071 USA.",ddoak@uwyo.edu,,,"NSF [DEB-9806818, DEB-0087096, DEB-0716433]","This work was supported by NSF grants DEB-9806818, DEB-0087096 and DEB-0716433.

This is contributing to the early emergence of type 2 diabetes and its related epidemic(1,2). Having either parent obese is an independent risk factor for childhood obesity(3). Although the detrimental impacts of diet-induced maternal obesity on adiposity and metabolism in offspring are well established(4), the extent of any contribution of obese fathers is unclear, particularly the role of non-genetic factors in the causal pathway. Here we show that paternal high-fat-diet (HFD) exposure programs beta-cell 'dysfunction' in rat F(1) female offspring. Chronic HFD consumption in Sprague-Dawley fathers induced increased body weight, adiposity, impaired glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity. Relative to controls, their female offspring had an early onset of impaired insulin secretion and glucose tolerance that worsened with time, and normal adiposity. Paternal HFD altered the expression of 642 pancreatic islet genes in adult female offspring (P < 0.01); genes belonged to 13 functional clusters, including cation and ATP binding, cytoskeleton and intracellular transport. Broader pathway analysis of 2,492 genes differentially expressed (P < 0.05) demonstrated involvement of calcium-, MAPK- and Wnt-signalling pathways, apoptosis and the cell cycle. Hypomethylation of the Il13ra2 gene, which showed the highest fold difference in expression (1.76-fold increase), was demonstrated. This is the first report in mammals of non-genetic, intergenerational transmission of metabolic sequelae of a HFD from father to offspring.","[Ng, Sheau-Fang; Morris, Margaret J.] Univ New S Wales, Dept Pharmacol, Sch Med Sci, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia; [Lin, Ruby C.

Although crucial for T(H)17 cells in vivo(5,6), IL-23 has been thought to be incapable of driving initial differentiation. Rather, IL-6 and transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta 1 have been proposed to be the factors responsible for initiating specification(7-10). Here we show that T(H)17 differentiation can occur in the absence of TGF-beta signalling. Neither IL-6 nor IL-23 alone efficiently generated T(H)17 cells; however, these cytokines in combination with IL-1 beta effectively induced IL-17 production in naive precursors, independently of TGF-beta. Epigenetic modification of the Il17a, Il17f and Rorc promoters proceeded without TGF-beta 1, allowing the generation of cells that co-expressed ROR gamma t (encoded by Rorc) and T-bet. T-bet(+)ROR gamma t(+) T(H)17 cells are generated in vivo during experimental allergic encephalomyelitis, and adoptively transferred T(H)17 cells generated with IL-23 without TGF-beta 1 were pathogenic in this disease model. These data indicate an alternative mode for T(H)17 differentiation. Consistent with genetic data linking IL23R with autoimmunity, our findings re-emphasize the importance of IL-23 and therefore may have therapeutic implications.","[Ghoreschi, Kamran; Laurence, Arian; Yang, Xiang-Ping; Ramos, Haydee L.; Wei, Lai; Kanno, Yuka; Watford, Wendy T.; O'Shea, John J.] NIAMSD, Mol Immunol & Inflammat Branch, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Tato, Cristina M.; McGeachy, Mandy J.; Cua, Daniel J.] Merck Res Labs, Palo Alto, CA 94304 USA; [Konkel, Joanne E.; Chen, WanJun] Natl Inst Dent & Craniofacial Res, Mucosal Immunol Unit, Oral Infect & Immun Branch, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Davidson, Todd S.; Chen, Qian; Shevach, EthanM.] NIAID, Immunol Lab, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Bouladoux, Nicolas; Grainger, John R.; Belkaid, Yasmine] NIAID, Mucosal Immunol Unit, Parasit Dis Lab, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Sun, Hong-Wei] NIAMSD, Biodata Min & Discovery Sect, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Eberl, GerRard] Inst Pasteur, Lymphoid Tissue Dev Unit, F-75724 Paris, France","Ghoreschi, K (reprint author), NIAMSD, Mol Immunol & Inflammat Branch, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA.",ghoreschik@mail.nih.gov; osheajo@mail.nih.gov,"Laurence, Arian/A-8770-2009; Yang, Xiangping/B-4833-2011; Eberl, Gerard/A-1160-2013; Kanno, Yuka/B-5802-2013; Wei, Lai/D-1088-2014","Laurence, Arian/0000-0003-0942-8292; ",NIAMS; NIDCR; NIAID,"We thank J.

Whereas the mechanism of hypoxia-driven angiogenesis is well understood(3,4), the link between inflammation-induced oxidation and de novo blood vessel growth remains obscure. Here we show that the end products of lipid oxidation, omega-(2-carboxyethyl) pyrrole (CEP) and other related pyrroles(5), are generated during inflammation and wound healing and accumulate at high levels in ageing tissues in mice and in highly vascularized tumours in both murine and human melanoma. The molecular patterns of carboxyalkylpyrroles are recognized by Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2), but not TLR4 or scavenger receptors on endothelial cells, leading to an angiogenic response that is independent of vascular endothelial growth factor. CEP promoted angiogenesis in hindlimb ischaemia and wound healing models through MyD88-dependent TLR2 signalling. Neutralization of endogenous carboxyalkylpyrroles impaired wound healing and tissue revascularization and diminished tumour angiogenesis. Both TLR2 and MyD88 are required for CEP-induced stimulation of Rac1 and endothelial migration. Taken together, these findings establish a new function of TLR2 as a sensor of oxidation-associated molecular patterns, providing a key link connecting inflammation, oxidative stress, innate immunity and angiogenesis.","[West, Xiaoxia Z.; Malinin, Nikolay L.; Merkulova, Alona A.; Tischenko, Mira; Kerr, Bethany A.; Podrez, Eugene A.; Byzova, Tatiana V.] Cleveland Clin Fdn, Dept Mol Cardiol, JJ Jacobs Ctr Thrombosis & Vasc Biol, Cleveland, OH 44195 USA; [West, Xiaoxia Z.; Salomon, Robert G.] Case Western Reserve Univ, Dept Chem, Cleveland, OH 44106 USA; [Borden, Ernest C.; Byzova, Tatiana V.] Cleveland Clin Fdn, Taussig Canc Inst, Cleveland, OH 44195 USA","Byzova, TV (reprint author), Cleveland Clin Fdn, Dept Mol Cardiol, JJ Jacobs Ctr Thrombosis & Vasc Biol, NB50,9500 Euclid Ave, Cleveland, OH 44195 USA.",byzovat@ccf.org,"Kerr, Bethany/D-1644-2012; Malinin, Nikolay/J-4271-2012","Kerr, Bethany/0000-0002-2995-7549; Malinin, Nikolay/0000-0002-2654-1783","NIH [HL073311, HL071625, CA126847, HL077213, GM021249]; American Heart Association [10SDG4300062]","We thank L.

Imprinted XCI begins with the detection of Xist RNA expression on the paternal X chromosome (Xp) at about the four-cell stage of embryonic development. In the embryonic tissues of the inner cell mass, a random form of XCI occurs in blastocysts that inactivates either Xp or the maternal X chromosome (Xm)(1,2). Both forms of XCI require the non-coding Xist RNA that coats the inactive X chromosome from which it is expressed. Xist has crucial functions in the silencing of X-linked genes, including Rnf12 (refs 3, 4) encoding the ubiquitin ligase RLIM (RING finger LIM-domain-interacting protein). Here we show, by targeting a conditional knockout of Rnf12 to oocytes where RLIM accumulates to high levels, that the maternal transmission of the mutant X chromosome (Delta m) leads to lethality in female embryos as a result of defective imprinted XCI. We provide evidence that in Delta m female embryos the initial formation of Xist clouds and Xp silencing are inhibited. In contrast, embryonic stem cells lacking RLIM are able to form Xist clouds and silence at least some X-linked genes during random XCI. These results assign crucial functions to the maternal deposit of Rnf12/RLIM for the initiation of imprinted XCI.","[Shin, JongDae; Ma, Hong; Taniguchi-Ishigaki, Naoko; Zhu, Xiaochun; Jiao, Baowei; Green, Michael R.; Bach, Ingolf] Univ Massachusetts, Sch Med, Program Gene Funct & Express, Worcester, MA 01605 USA; [Green, Michael R.; Bach, Ingolf] Univ Massachusetts, Sch Med, Program Mol Med, Worcester, MA 01605 USA; [Zhu, Xiaochun; Green, Michael R.] Univ Massachusetts, Sch Med, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Worcester, MA 01605 USA; [Byron, Meg; Hall, Lisa L.; Jones, Stephen N.; Lawrence, Jeanne B.] Univ Massachusetts, Sch Med, Dept Cell Biol, Worcester, MA 01605 USA; [Bossenz, Michael; Hermans-Borgmeyer, Irm] Univ Hamburg, Ctr Mol Neurobiol, D-20246 Hamburg, Germany; [Chung, Young] Stem Cell & Regenerat Med Int Inc, Marlborough, MA 01752 USA; [Chung, Young] CHA Univ, Sch Med, Seoul 135081, South Korea","Bach, I (reprint author), Univ Massachusetts, Sch Med, Program Gene Funct & Express, Worcester, MA 01605 USA.",ingolf.bach@umassmed.edu,,,"National Institutes of Health (National Cancer Institute) [R01CA131158]; National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases [5 P30 DK32520, GM053234]","We thank V.

The CTX phi prophage, which encodes cholera toxin in Vibrio cholerae(1), is known to be adjacent to a chromosomally integrated element of unknown function termed the toxin-linked cryptic (TLC)(2). Here we report the characterization of a TLC-related element that corresponds to the genome of a satellite filamentous phage (TLC-Kn phi 1), which uses the morphogenesis genes of another filamentous phage (fs2 phi) to form infectious TLC-Kn phi 1 phage particles. The TLC-Kn phi 1 phage genome carries a sequence similar to the dif recombination sequence, which functions in chromosome dimer resolution using XerC and XerD recombinases(3). The dif sequence is also exploited by lysogenic filamentous phages (for example CTX phi) for chromosomal integration of their genomes. Bacterial cells defective in the dimer resolution often show an aberrant filamentous cell morphology(3,4). We found that acquisition and chromosomal integration of the TLC-Kn phi 1 genome restored a perfect dif site and normal morphology to V. cholerae wild-type and mutant strains with dif(-) filamentation phenotypes. Furthermore, lysogeny of a dif(-) non-toxigenic V. cholerae with TLC-Kn phi 1 promoted its subsequent toxigenic conversion through integration of CTX phi into the restored dif site. These results reveal a remarkable level of cooperative interactions between multiple filamentous phages in the emergence of the bacterial pathogen that causes cholera.","[Hassan, Faizule; Kamruzzaman, M.; Faruque, Shah M.] Int Ctr Diarrhoeal Dis Res, Mol Genet Lab, Dhaka 1212, Bangladesh; [Mekalanos, John J.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Microbiol & Mol Genet, Boston, MA 02115 USA","Faruque, SM (reprint author), Int Ctr Diarrhoeal Dis Res, Mol Genet Lab, Dhaka 1212, Bangladesh.",faruque@icddrb.org,,,"National Institutes of Health under Harvard Medical School and the International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh (ICDDR,B) [RO1-GM068851, RO1-AI070963]","We thank T.

Metastatic mouse and human tumours deficient in TAp63 express Dicer at very low levels, and we found that modulation of expression of Dicer and miR-130b markedly affected the metastatic potential of cells lacking TAp63. TAp63 binds to and transactivates the Dicer promoter, demonstrating direct transcriptional regulation of Dicer by TAp63.

The extent to which societies have decreased in complexity is also unclear. These debates have continued largely in the absence of rigorous, quantitative tests. We evaluated six competing models of political evolution in Austronesian-speaking societies using phylogenetic methods. Here we show that in the best-fitting model political complexity rises and falls in a sequence of small steps. This is closely followed by another model in which increases are sequential but decreases can be either sequential or in bigger drops. The results indicate that large, non-sequential jumps in political complexity have not occurred during the evolutionary history of these societies. This suggests that, despite the numerous contingent pathways of human history, there are regularities in cultural evolution that can be detected using computational phylogenetic methods.","[Currie, Thomas E.; Hasegawa, Toshikazu] Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Arts & Sci, Evolutionary Cognit Sci Res Ctr, Tokyo 1538902, Japan; [Currie, Thomas E.; Mace, Ruth] UCL, Dept Anthropol, Human Evolutionary Ecol Grp, London WC1H 0BW, England; [Greenhill, Simon J.; Gray, Russell D.] Univ Auckland, Dept Psychol, Auckland 1142, New Zealand; [Greenhill, Simon J.] Univ Auckland, Computat Evolut Grp, Auckland 1142, New Zealand","Currie, TE (reprint author), Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Arts & Sci, Evolutionary Cognit Sci Res Ctr, Tokyo 1538902, Japan.",t.currie@ucl.ac.uk,"Greenhill, Simon/B-3114-2011; Gray, Russell /H-2078-2015","Greenhill, Simon/0000-0001-7832-6156; Gray, Russell /0000-0002-9858-0191; Mace, Ruth/0000-0002-6137-7739",ESRC/NERC; Japan Society for the Promotion of Science; Royal Society of New Zealand; European Research Council,"We thank R.

Here we present a subnanometre-resolution cryo-electron microscopy reconstruction of the human Ndc80 complex bound to microtubules, sufficient for precise docking of crystal structures of the component proteins. We find that the Ndc80 complex binds the microtubule with a tubulin monomer repeat, recognizing alpha- and beta-tubulin at both intra-and inter-tubulin dimer interfaces in a manner that is sensitive to tubulin conformation. Furthermore, Ndc80 complexes self-associate along protofilaments through interactions mediated by the amino-terminal tail of the NDC80 protein, which is the site of phospho-regulation by Aurora B kinase. The complex's mode of interaction with the microtubule and its oligomerization suggest a mechanism by which Aurora B could regulate the stability of load-bearing kinetochore-microtubule attachments.","[Ball, David A.; Nogales, Eva] Univ Calif Berkeley, Lawrence Berkeley Lab, Div Life Sci, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Alushin, Gregory M.; Ramey, Vincent H.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Biophys Grad Grp, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Pasqualato, Sebastiano; Musacchio, Andrea] European Inst Oncol, Dept Expt Oncol, I-20139 Milan, Italy; [Grigorieff, Nikolaus] Brandeis Univ, Rosenstiel Basic Med Res Ctr, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Waltham, MA 02453 USA; [Musacchio, Andrea] Italian Inst Technol, Res Unit, I-20139 Milan, Italy; [Nogales, Eva] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mol & Cell Biol, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA","Nogales, E (reprint author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Lawrence Berkeley Lab, Div Life Sci, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",enogales@lbl.gov,"Pasqualato, Sebastiano/G-1032-2011","Musacchio, Andrea/0000-0003-2362-8784; Alushin, Gregory/0000-0001-7250-4484",National Institute of General Medical Sciences,"We are grateful to K.

Because the cold gas is essentially primordial, it has a very low abundance of elements heavier than helium (referred to as metallicity). If funnelled to the centre of a galaxy, it will result in the central gas having an overall lower metallicity than gas further from the centre, because the gas further out has been enriched by supernovae and stellar winds, and not diluted by the primordial gas. Here we report chemical abundances across three rotationally supported star-forming galaxies at redshift z approximate to 3, only 2 Gyr after the Big Bang. We find 'inverse' gradients, with the central, star-forming regions having lower metallicities than less active ones, which is opposite to what is seen in local galaxies(6,7).

The appearance of this object, in an asteroidal orbit (small eccentricity and inclination) in the inner main asteroid belt attracted attention as a potential new member of the recently recognized(2) class of main-belt comets. If confirmed, this new object would expand the range in heliocentric distance over which main-belt comets are found. Here we report observations of P/2010 A2 by the Rosetta spacecraft. We conclude that the trail arose from a single event, rather than a period of cometary activity, in agreement with independent results(3). The trail is made up of relatively large particles of millimetre to centimetre size that remain close to the parent asteroid. The shape of the trail can be explained by an initial impact ejecting large clumps of debris that disintegrated and dispersed almost immediately. We determine that this was an asteroid collision that occurred around 10 February 2009.","[Snodgrass, Colin; Tubiana, Cecilia; Vincent, Jean-Baptiste; Sierks, Holger; Hviid, Stubbe; Moissl, Richard; Boehnhardt, Hermann] Max Planck Inst Sonnensyst Forsch, D-37191 Katlenburg Lindau, Germany; [Snodgrass, Colin] European So Observ, Santiago 19, Chile; [Barbieri, Cesare; Marchi, Simone] Univ Padua, Dept Astron, I-35122 Padua, Italy; [Koschny, Detlef] European Space Agcy, Res & Sci Support Dept, NL-2201 AZ Noordwijk, Netherlands; [Lamy, Philippe] Univ Aix Marseille, CNRS, Lab Astrophys Marseille, UMR6110, F-13388 Marseille 13, France; [Rickman, Hans] Uppsala Univ, Dept Astron & Space Sci, S-75120 Uppsala, Sweden; [Rickman, Hans] PAS Space Res Ctr, PL-00716 Warsaw, Poland; [Rodrigo, Rafael] CSIC, Inst Astrofis Andalucia, E-18080 Granada, Spain; [Carry, Benoit] Observ Paris, LESIA, F-92195 Meudon, France; [Lowry, Stephen C.; Laird, Ryan J.

Disruption, through high-velocity collisions or rotational spin-up, is believed to be the primary mechanism for the production and destruction of small asteroids(1,2) and a contributor to dust in the Sun's zodiacal cloud(3), while analogous collisions around other stars feed dust to their debris disks(4). Unfortunately, direct evidence about the mechanism or rate of disruption is lacking, owing to the rarity of the events. Here we report observations of P/2010 A2, a previously unknown inner-belt asteroid with a peculiar, comet-like morphology. The data reveal a nucleus of diameter approximately 120 metres with an associated tail of millimetre-sized dust particles. We conclude that it is most probably the remnant of a recent asteroidal disruption in February/March 2009, evolving slowly under the action of solar radiation pressure, in agreement with independent work(5).","[Jewitt, David; Drahus, Michal] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Earth & Space Sci, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Jewitt, David] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Inst Geophys & Planetary Phys, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Jewitt, David] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Phys & Astron, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Weaver, Harold] Johns Hopkins Univ, Appl Phys Lab, Laurel, MD 20723 USA; [Agarwal, Jessica] European Space Agcy, European Space Res & Technol Ctr, NL-2200 AG Noordwijk, Netherlands; [Mutchler, Max] Space Telescope Sci Inst, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA","Jewitt, D (reprint author), Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Earth & Space Sci, 3713 Geol Bldg,595 Charles Young Dr E, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.",jewitt@ucla.edu,"Weaver, Harold/D-9188-2016","Mutchler, Maximilian/0000-0002-0088-3021",,,,18,76,76,0,5,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,14-Oct,2010,467,7317,,,,,817,819,,10.1038/nature09456,,3,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,663PB,WOS:000282898700061,20944743,No,,,11/20/17

F.; DeMille, D.",,,Laser cooling of a diatomic molecule,NATURE,,,English,Article,,,,,,,POLAR-MOLECULES; TEMPERATURES; MONOHALIDES; CHEMISTRY; ATOMS; FIELD; SRF,"It has been roughly three decades since laser cooling techniques produced ultracold atoms(1-3), leading to rapid advances in a wide array of fields. Laser cooling has not yet been extended to molecules because of their complex internal structure. However, this complexity makes molecules potentially useful for a wide range of applications(4). For example, heteronuclear molecules possess permanent electric dipole moments that lead to long-range, tunable, anisotropic dipole-dipole interactions. The combination of the dipole-dipole interaction and the precise control over molecular degrees of freedom possible at ultracold temperatures makes ultracold molecules attractive candidates for use in quantum simulations of condensed-matter systems(5) and in quantum computation(6). Also, ultracold molecules could provide unique opportunities for studying chemical dynamics(7,8) and for tests of fundamental symmetries(9-11). Here we experimentally demonstrate laser cooling of the polar molecule strontium monofluoride (SrF). Using an optical cycling scheme requiring only three lasers(12), we have observed both Sisyphus and Doppler cooling forces that reduce the transverse temperature of a SrF molecular beam substantially, to a few millikelvin or less. At present, the only technique for producing ultracold molecules is to bind together ultracold alkali atoms through Feshbach resonance(13) or photoassociation(14). However, proposed applications for ultracold molecules require a variety of molecular energy-level structures (for example unpaired electronic spin(5,9,11,15), Omega doublets(16) and so on). Our method provides an alternative route to ultracold molecules. In particular, it bridges the gap between ultracold (submillikelvin) temperatures and the similar to 1-K temperatures attainable with directly cooled molecules (for example with cryogenic buffer-gas cooling(17) or decelerated supersonic beams(18)). Ultimately, our technique should allow the production of large samples of molecules at ultracold temperatures for species that are chemically distinct from bialkalis.","[Shuman, E. S.; Barry, J.

On a global scale, biogenic VOCs account for about 90% of VOC emissions(1,8) and of SOA formation (90 billion kilograms of carbon per year)(1-4). SOA particles can scatter radiation and act as cloud condensation or ice nuclei, and thereby influence the Earth's radiation balance and climate(1,2,5,9,10). They consist of a myriad of different compounds with varying physicochemical properties, and little information is available on the phase state of SOA particles. Gas-particle partitioning models usually assume that SOA particles are liquid(1,5,11), but here we present experimental evidence that they can be solid under ambient conditions. We investigated biogenic SOA particles formed from oxidation products of VOCs in plant chamber experiments and in boreal forests within a few hours after atmospheric nucleation events. On the basis of observed particle bouncing in an aerosol impactor and of electron microscopy we conclude that biogenic SOA particles can adopt an amorphous solid-most probably glassy-state. This amorphous solid state should provoke a rethinking of SOA processes because it may influence the partitioning of semi-volatile compounds, reduce the rate of heterogeneous chemical reactions, affect the particles' ability to accommodate water and act as cloud condensation or ice nuclei, and change the atmospheric lifetime of the particles(12-15). Thus, the results of this study challenge traditional views of the kinetics and thermodynamics of SOA formation and transformation in the atmosphere and their implications for air quality and climate.","[Virtanen, Annele; Kannosto, Jonna; Makela, Jyrki M.] Tampere Univ Technol, Dept Phys, FIN-33101 Tampere, Finland; [Joutsensaari, Jorma; Worsnop, Douglas R.; Laaksonen, Ari] Univ Eastern Finland, Dept Math & Phys, Kuopio 70211, Finland; [Koop, Thomas] Univ Bielefeld, Dept Chem, D-33615 Bielefeld, Germany; [Yli-Pirila, Pasi; Leskinen, Jani; Holopainen, Jarmo K.] Univ Eastern Finland, Dept Environm Sci, Kuopio 70211, Finland; [Poeschl, Ulrich] Max Planck Inst Chem, Biogeochem Dept, D-55128 Mainz, Germany; [Kulmala, Markku; Worsnop, Douglas R.] Univ Helsinki, Dept Phys, Helsinki 00014, Finland; [Kulmala, Markku] Stockholm Univ, Dept Appl Environm Sci, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden; [Worsnop, Douglas R.] Aerodyne Res Inc, Billerica, MA 01821 USA; [Worsnop, Douglas R.; Laaksonen, Ari] Finnish Meteorol Inst, FIN-00101 Helsinki, Finland","Virtanen, A (reprint author), Tampere Univ Technol, Dept Phys, POB 692, FIN-33101 Tampere, Finland.",annele.virtanen@tut.fi; thomas.koop@uni-bielefeld.de,"Koop, Thomas/B-7861-2008; Poschl, Ulrich/A-6263-2010; Laaksonen, Ari/B-5094-2011; Holopainen, Jarmo/B-1656-2008; Worsnop, Douglas/D-2817-2009; Makela, Jyrki/G-4223-2014; Virtanen, Annele/E-7699-2010; Kulmala, Markku/I-7671-2016","Koop, Thomas/0000-0002-7571-3684; Poschl, Ulrich/0000-0003-1412-3557; Laaksonen, Ari/0000-0002-1657-2383; Holopainen, Jarmo/0000-0001-5026-3245; Worsnop, Douglas/0000-0002-8928-8017; Makela, Jyrki Mikael/0000-0002-6757-3589; Virtanen, Annele/0000-0002-2917-5344; Kulmala, Markku/0000-0003-3464-7825","Academy of Finland [110763, 111543, 131019, 218115]; Maj and Tor Nessling foundation","We acknowledge support by the Academy of Finland (decision numbers 110763, 111543, 131019, 218115 and Centre of Excellence Programme) and the Maj and Tor Nessling foundation.

Significant amounts of that water are released as the lithosphere heats up, triggering earthquakes and fluxing arc volcanism(1). In addition, there is experimental evidence for high solubility of water in olivine, the most abundant mineral in the upper mantle, for even higher solubility in olivine's high-pressure polymorphs, wadsleyite and ringwoodite(2), and for the existence of dense hydrous magnesium silicates that potentially could carry water well into the lower mantle(3) (deeper than 1,000 km). Here we compare experimental and seismic evidence to test whether patterns of seismicity and the stabilities of these potentially relevant hydrous phases are consistent with a wet lithosphere. We show that there is nearly a one-to-one correlation between dehydration of minerals and seismicity at depths less than about 250 km, and conclude that the dehydration of minerals is the trigger of instability that leads to seismicity. At greater depths, however, we find no correlation between occurrences of earthquakes and depths where breakdown of hydrous phases is expected. Lastly, we note that there is compelling evidence for the existence of metastable olivine (which, if present, can explain the distribution of deep-focus earthquakes(4-7)) west of and within the subducting Tonga slab(8) and also in three other subduction zones, despite metastable olivine being incompatible with even extremely small amounts of water (of the order of 100 p.p.m. by weight(7)). We conclude that subducting slabs are essentially dry at depths below 400 km and thus do not provide a pathway for significant amounts of water to enter the mantle transition zone or the lower mantle.","[Green, Harry W., II] Univ Calif Riverside, Inst Geophys & Planetary Phys, Riverside, CA 92521 USA; [Green, Harry W., II] Univ Calif Riverside, Dept Earth Sci, Riverside, CA 92521 USA; [Chen, Wang-Ping] Univ Illinois, Dept Geol, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Brudzinski, Michael R.] Miami Univ, Dept Geol, Oxford, OH 45056 USA","Green, HW (reprint author), Univ Calif Riverside, Inst Geophys & Planetary Phys, Riverside, CA 92521 USA.",harry.green@ucr.edu,"Brudzinski, Michael/A-8301-2011",,"NSF [EAR0552011, EAR-0652626, EAR-0125938, EAR9909362, EAR0551995, EAR552002]; National Science Council of Taiwan at the Academia Sinica","We thank L.

Genome-wide association (GWA) studies have identified more than 600 variants associated with human traits(1), but these typically explain small fractions of phenotypic variation, raising questions about the use of further studies. Here, using 183,727 individuals, we show that hundreds of genetic variants, in at least 180 loci, influence adult height, a highly heritable and classic polygenic trait(2,3). The large number of loci reveals patterns with important implications for genetic studies of common human diseases and traits. First, the 180 loci are not random, but instead are enriched for genes that are connected in biological pathways (P = 0.016) and that underlie skeletal growth defects (P<0.001). Second, the likely causal gene is often located near the most strongly associated variant: in 13 of 21 loci containing a known skeletal growth gene, that gene was closest to the associated variant. Third, at least 19 loci have multiple independently associated variants, suggesting that allelic heterogeneity is a frequent feature of polygenic traits, that comprehensive explorations of already-discovered loci should discover additional variants and that an appreciable fraction of associated loci may have been identified. Fourth, associated variants are enriched for likely functional effects on genes, being over-represented among variants that alter amino-acid structure of proteins and expression levels of nearby genes. Our data explain approximately 10% of the phenotypic variation in height, and we estimate that unidentified common variants of similar effect sizes would increase this figure to approximately 16% of phenotypic variation (approximately 20% of heritable variation). Although additional approaches are needed to dissect the genetic architecture of polygenic human traits fully, our findings indicate that GWA studies can identify large numbers of loci that implicate biologically relevant genes and pathways.","[Allen, Hana Lango; Weedon, Michael N.; Wood, Andrew R.; Perry, John R.

COs require the formation of double strand breaks (DSBs) to create the substrate for strand exchange. DSBs occur in small intervals called hotspots(1-3) and significant variation in hotspot usage exists between and among individuals(4). This variation is thought to reflect differences in sequence identity and chromatin structure, DNA topology and/or chromosome domain organization(1,5-9). Chromosomes show different frequencies of nondisjunction (NDJ)(10), reflecting inherent differences in meiotic crossover control, yet the underlying basis of these differences remains elusive. Here we show that a novel chromatin factor, X non-disjunction factor 1 (xnd-1), is responsible for the global distribution of COs in C. elegans. xnd-1 is also required for formation of double-strand breaks (DSBs) on the X, but surprisingly XND-1 protein is autosomally enriched. We show that xnd-1 functions independently of genes required for X chromosome-specific gene silencing, revealing a novel pathway that distinguishes the X from autosomes in the germ line, and further show that xnd-1 exerts its effects on COs, at least in part, by modulating levels of H2A lysine 5 acetylation.","[Wagner, Cynthia R.; Yanowitz, Judith L.] Carnegie Inst Washington, Dept Embryol, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA; [Kuervers, Lynnette; Baillie, David L.] Simon Fraser Univ, Dept Mol Biol & Biochem, Burnaby, BC V5A 1S6, Canada; [Yanowitz, Judith L.] Magee Womens Res Inst, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA; [Yanowitz, Judith L.] Univ Pittsburgh, Sch Med, Dept Obstet Gynecol & Reprod Sci, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA","Yanowitz, JL (reprint author), Carnegie Inst Washington, Dept Embryol, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA.",yanowitzjl@mwri.magee.edu,,,"Carnegie Institution of Washington, NIH [K01AG031296]; MWRI; NSERC","We thank J.

Whereas alpha beta TCR ligation by the peptide-loaded major histocompatibility complex initiates T-cell signalling(4), preTCR-induced signalling occurs by means of a ligand-independent dimerization event(5). The pre-TCR comprises an invariant a-chain (pre-T alpha) that pairs with any TCR beta-chain (TCR beta) following successful TCR beta-gene rearrangement(6). Here we provide the basis of pre-T alpha-TCR beta assembly and pre-TCR dimerization. The pre-T alpha chain comprised a single immunoglobulin-like domain that is structurally distinct from the constant (C) domain of the TCR alpha-chain(7); nevertheless, the mode of association between pre-T alpha and TCRb mirrored that mediated by the C alpha-C beta domains of the abTCR. The pre-TCR had a propensity to dimerize in solution, and the molecular envelope of the pre-TCR dimer correlated well with the observed head-to-tail pre-TCR dimer. This mode of pre-TCR dimerization enabled the pre-T alpha domain to interact with the variable (V) beta domain through residues that are highly conserved across the V beta and joining (J) beta gene families, thus mimicking the interactions at the core of the alpha beta TCR's V alpha-V beta interface. Disruption of this pre-T alpha-V beta dimer interface abrogated pre-TCR dimerization in solution and impaired pre-TCR expression on the cell surface. Accordingly, we provide a mechanism of pre-TCR self-association that allows the pre-T alpha chain to simultaneously 'sample' the correct folding of both the V and C domains of any TCR beta-chain, regardless of its ultimate specificity, which represents a critical checkpoint in T-cell development. This unusual dual-chaperone-like sensing function of pre-T alpha represents a unique mechanism in nature whereby developmental quality control regulates the expression and signalling of an integral membrane receptor complex.","[Chen, Zhenjun; Kjer-Nielsen, Lars; La Gruta, Nicole L.; Godfrey, Dale I.; McCluskey, James] Univ Melbourne, Dept Microbiol & Immunol, Parkville, Vic 3010, Australia; [Pang, Siew Siew; Berry, Richard; Wang, Christina; Chew, Sock Hui; Williams, Neal K.; Beddoe, Travis; Tiganis, Tony; Cowieson, Nathan P.; Wilce, Matthew C.

KIT is highly expressed in interstitial cells of Cajal (ICCs)-the presumed cell of origin for GIST-as well as in haematopoietic stem cells, melanocytes, mast cells and germ cells(2,3). Yet, families harbouring germline activating KIT mutations and mice with knock-in Kit mutations almost exclusively develop ICC hyperplasia and GIST(4-7), suggesting that the cellular context is important for KIT to mediate oncogenesis. Here we show that the ETS family member ETV1 is highly expressed in the subtypes of ICCs sensitive to oncogenic KIT mediated transformation(8), and is required for their development. In addition, ETV1 is universally highly expressed in GISTs and is required for growth of imatinib-sensitive and resistant GIST cell lines. Transcriptome profiling and global analyses of ETV1-binding sites suggest that ETV1 is a master regulator of an ICC-GIST-specific transcription network mainly through enhancer binding. The ETV1 transcriptional program is further regulated by activated KIT, which prolongs ETV1 protein stability and cooperates with ETV1 to promote tumorigenesis. We propose that GIST arises from ICCs with high levels of endogenous ETV1 expression that, when coupled with an activating KIT mutation, drives an oncogenic ETS transcriptional program. This differs from other ETS-dependent tumours such as prostate cancer, melanoma and Ewing sarcoma where genomic translocation or amplification drives aberrant ETS expression(9-11). It also represents a novel mechanism of oncogenic transcription factor activation.","[Chi, Ping; Allis, C.

In lethal systemic anthrax, proliferating bacilli secrete large quantities of the toxins lethal factor (LF) and oedema factor (EF), leading to widespread vascular leakage and shock. Whereas host targets of LF (mitogen-activated protein-kinase kinases) and EF (cAMP-dependent processes)(3) have been implicated in the initial phase of anthrax(1,2), less is understood about toxin action during the final stage of infection. Here we use Drosophila melanogaster to identify the Rab11/Sec15 exocyst, which acts at the last step of endocytic recycling, as a novel target of both EF and LF. EF reduces levels of apically localized Rab11 and indirectly blocks vesicle formation by its binding partner and effector Sec15 (Sec15-GFP), whereas LF acts more directly to reduce Sec15-GFP vesicles. Convergent effects of EF and LF on Rab11/Sec15 inhibit expression of and signalling by the Notch ligand Delta and reduce DE-cadherin levels at adherens junctions. In human endothelial cells, the two toxins act in a conserved fashion to block formation of Sec15 vesicles, inhibit Notch signalling, and reduce cadherin expression at adherens junctions. This coordinated disruption of the Rab11/Sec15 exocyst by anthrax toxins may contribute to toxin-dependent barrier disruption and vascular dysfunction during B. anthracis infection.","[Guichard, Annabel; Cruz-Moreno, Beatriz; Bier, Ethan] Univ Calif San Diego, Sect Cell & Dev Biol, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [McGillivray, Shauna M.; van Sorge, Nina M.; Nizet, Victor] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Pediat, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [McGillivray, Shauna M.] Texas Christian Univ, Dept Biol, Ft Worth, TX 76129 USA; [Nizet, Victor] Univ Calif San Diego, Skaggs Sch Pharm & Pharmaceut Sci, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA","Bier, E (reprint author), Univ Calif San Diego, Sect Cell & Dev Biol, 9500 Gilman Dr, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.",ebier@ucsd.edu,"van Sorge, Nina/E-3290-2017","van Sorge, Nina/0000-0002-2695-5863; Nizet, Victor/0000-0003-3847-0422","National Institutes of Health (NIH) [AI070654, NS29870, AI077780]; IRACDA NIH [GM068524]; Hartwell Foundation","We thank A.

Although generally associated with various mucocutaneous diseases, HSV-1 is also involved in lethal encephalitis(1). HSV-1 entry into host cells requires cellular receptors for both envelope glycoproteins B (gB) and D (gD)(2-4). However, the gB receptors responsible for its broad host range in vitro and infection of critical targets in vivo1 remain unknown. Here we show that non-muscle myosin heavy chain IIA (NMHC-IIA), a subunit of non-muscle myosin IIA (NM-IIA), functions as an HSV-1 entry receptor by interacting with gB. A cell line that is relatively resistant to HSV-1 infection(5) became highly susceptible to infection by this virus when NMHC-IIA was overexpressed. Antibody to NMHC-IIA blocked HSV-1 infection in naturally permissive target cells. Furthermore, knockdown of NMHC-IIA in the permissive cells inhibited HSV-1 infection as well as cell-cell fusion when gB, gD, gH and gL were coexpressed. Cell-surface expression of NMHC-IIA was markedly and rapidly induced during the initiation of HSV-1 entry. A specific inhibitor of myosin light chain kinase, which regulates NM-IIA by phosphorylation(6), reduced the redistribution of NMHC-IIA as well as HSV-1 infection in cell culture and in a murine model for herpes stromal keratitis. NMHC-IIA is ubiquitously expressed in various human tissues and cell types(7) and, therefore, is implicated as a functional gB receptor that mediates broad HSV-1 infectivity both in vitro and in vivo. The identification of NMHC-IIA as an HSV-1 entry receptor and the involvement of NM-IIA regulation in HSV-1 infection provide an insight into HSV-1 entry and identify new targets for antiviral drug development.","[Arii, Jun; Imai, Takahiko; Minowa, Atsuko; Kawaguchi, Yasushi] Univ Tokyo, Inst Med Sci, Int Res Ctr Infect Dis,Div Viral Infect, Dept Infect Dis Control,Minato Ku, Tokyo 1088639, Japan; [Arii, Jun; Akashi, Hiroomi] Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Agr & Life Sci, Dept Vet Microbiol, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo 1138657, Japan; [Goto, Hideo; Kawaoka, Yoshihiro] Univ Tokyo, Inst Med Sci, Dept Microbiol & Immunol, Div Virol,Minato Ku, Tokyo 1088639, Japan; [Suenaga, Tadahiro; Arase, Hisashi] Osaka Univ, Microbial Dis Res Inst, Dept Immunochem, Suita, Osaka 5650871, Japan; [Oyama, Masaaki; Kozuka-Hata, Hiroko] Univ Tokyo, Inst Med Sci, Med Prote Lab, Minato Ku, Tokyo 1088639, Japan; [Arase, Hisashi] Osaka Univ, WPI Immunol Frontier Res Ctr, Suita, Osaka 5650871, Japan; [Arase, Hisashi] Japan Sci & Technol Agcy, Kawaguchi, Saitama 3320012, Japan; [Kawaoka, Yoshihiro] Univ Tokyo, Inst Med Sci, Int Res Ctr Infect Dis, Dept Special Pathogens,Minato Ku, Tokyo 1088639, Japan; [Kawaoka, Yoshihiro] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Pathobiol Sci, Madison, WI 53711 USA; [Kawaoka, Yoshihiro] ERATO Infect Induced Host Responses Project, Kawaguchi, Saitama 3320012, Japan","Kawaguchi, Y (reprint author), Univ Tokyo, Inst Med Sci, Int Res Ctr Infect Dis,Div Viral Infect, Dept Infect Dis Control,Minato Ku, Tokyo 1088639, Japan.",ykawagu@ims.u-tokyo.ac.jp,"Arase, Hisashi/C-8442-2009","Arase, Hisashi/0000-0002-1153-3166","Japan Initiative for Global Research Network on Infectious Diseases; Founding Research Center for Emerging; Ministry of Education, Science, Sports and Culture of Japan; Ministry of Health of Japan; Takeda Science Foundation; ERATO (Japan Science and Technology Agency); Japan Society for the Promotion of Science","We thank P.

The nucleotides ATP and UTP represent one class of find-me signals(2), but their mechanism of release is not known. Here, we identify the plasma membrane channel pannexin 1 (PANX1) as a mediator of find-me signal/nucleotide release from apoptotic cells. Pharmacological inhibition and siRNA-mediated knockdown of PANX1 led to decreased nucleotide release and monocyte recruitment by apoptotic cells. Conversely, PANX1 overexpression enhanced nucleotide release from apoptotic cells and phagocyte recruitment. Patch-clamp recordings showed that PANX1 was basally inactive, and that induction of PANX1 currents occurred only during apoptosis. Mechanistically, PANX1 itself was a target of effector caspases (caspases 3 and 7), and a specific caspase-cleavage site within PANX1 was essential for PANX1 function during apoptosis. Expression of truncated PANX1 (at the putative caspase cleavage site) resulted in a constitutively open channel. PANX1 was also important for the 'selective' plasma membrane permeability of early apoptotic cells to specific dyes(3). Collectively, these data identify PANX1 as a plasma membrane channel mediating the regulated release of find-me signals and selective plasma membrane permeability during apoptosis, and a new mechanism of PANX1 activation by caspases.","[Chekeni, Faraaz B.; Elliott, Michael R.; Walk, Scott F.; Kinchen, Jason M.; Armstrong, Allison J.; Ravichandran, Kodi S.] Univ Virginia, Beirne B Carter Ctr Immunol Res, Charlottesville, VA 22908 USA; [Chekeni, Faraaz B.; Sandilos, Joanna K.; Bayliss, Douglas A.] Univ Virginia, Dept Pharmacol, Charlottesville, VA 22908 USA; [Elliott, Michael R.; Walk, Scott F.; Kinchen, Jason M.; Armstrong, Allison J.; Ravichandran, Kodi S.] Univ Virginia, Ctr Cell Clearance, Charlottesville, VA 22908 USA; [Kinchen, Jason M.; Ravichandran, Kodi S.] Univ Virginia, Dept Microbiol, Charlottesville, VA 22908 USA; [Isakson, Brant E.] Univ Virginia, Cardiovasc Res Ctr, Charlottesville, VA 22908 USA; [Isakson, Brant E.] Univ Virginia, Dept Mol Physiol & Biol Phys, Charlottesville, VA 22908 USA; [Lazarowski, Eduardo R.] Univ N Carolina, Dept Pharmacol, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA; [Penuela, Silvia; Laird, Dale W.] Univ Western Ontario, Dept Anat & Cell Biol, London, ON N6A 5C1, Canada; [Salvesen, Guy S.] Burnham Inst Med Res, Program Apoptosis & Cell Death Res, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA","Ravichandran, KS (reprint author), Univ Virginia, Beirne B Carter Ctr Immunol Res, Charlottesville, VA 22908 USA.",Ravi@virgina.edu,"Penuela, Silvia/A-6961-2010; Laird, Dale /E-4176-2015","Penuela, Silvia/0000-0003-4829-5517; Elliott, Michael/0000-0002-0642-482X",NIGMS; NHLBI; AHA; National Institutes of Health; American Heart Association; American Cancer Society; American Asthma Foundation,"We thank members of the Ravichandran laboratory for their comments and suggestions.

Proteolysis occurs in a barrelshaped 20S core particle, which in Thermoplasma acidophilum is built from four stacked homoheptameric rings of subunits, alpha and beta, arranged alpha(7)beta(7)beta(7)alpha(7) (ref. 5). These rings form three interconnected cavities, including a pair of antechambers (formed by alpha(7)beta(7)) through which substrates are passed before degradation and a catalytic chamber (beta(7)beta(7)) where the peptide-bond hydrolysis reaction occurs(4,5). Although it is clear that substrates must be unfolded to enter through narrow, gated passageways (13 angstrom in diameter) located on the alpha-rings(1,6,7), the structural and dynamical properties of substrates inside the proteasome antechamber remain unclear. Confinement in the antechamber might be expected to promote folding and thus impede proteolysis. Here we investigate the folding, stability and dynamics of three small protein substrates in the antechamber by methyl transverse-relaxation-optimized NMR spectroscopy(8). We show that these substrates interact actively with the antechamber walls and have drastically altered kinetic and equilibrium properties that maintain them in unstructured states so as to be accessible for hydrolysis.","[Ruschak, Amy M.; Religa, Tomasz L.; Kay, Lewis E.] Univ Toronto, Dept Mol Genet, Toronto, ON M5S 1A8, Canada; [Ruschak, Amy M.; Religa, Tomasz L.; Kay, Lewis E.] Univ Toronto, Dept Biochem & Chem, Toronto, ON M5S 1A8, Canada; [Breuer, Sarah; Witt, Susanne] Max Planck Inst Biochem, Dept Biol Struct, D-82152 Martinsried, Germany","Kay, LE (reprint author), Univ Toronto, Dept Mol Genet, 100 Coll St, Toronto, ON M5S 1A8, Canada.",kay@pound.med.utoronto.ca,,,European Molecular Biology Organization [ALTF 827-2006]; Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR); Canada Research Chair in Biochemistry; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada,"The authors would like to thank J.

Here we report measurements of functional connectivity between the input and ouput layers of the macaque retina at single-cell resolution and the implications of these for colour vision. Multi-electrode technology was used to record simultaneously from complete populations of the retinal ganglion cell types (midget, parasol and small bistratified) that transmit high-resolution visual signals to the brain. Fine-grained visual stimulation was used to identify the location, type and strength of the functional input of each cone photoreceptor to each ganglion cell. The populations of ON and OFF midget and parasol cells each sampled the complete population of long- and middle-wavelength-sensitive cones. However, only OFF midget cells frequently received strong input from short-wavelength-sensitive cones. ON and OFF midget cells showed a small non-randomtendency to selectively sample from either long- or middle-wavelength-sensitive cones to a degree not explained by clumping in the cone mosaic. These measurements reveal computations in a neural circuit at the elementary resolution of individual neurons.","[Field, Greg D.; Gauthier, Jeffrey L.; Greschner, Martin; Machado, Timothy A.; Jepson, Lauren H.; Shlens, Jonathon; Chichilnisky, E.

Mechanistic insight into the functions of human BRCA2 has been limited by the difficulty of isolating this large protein (3,418 amino acids). Here we report the purification of full-length BRCA2 and show that it both binds RAD51 and potentiates recombinational DNA repair by promoting assembly of RAD51 onto single-stranded DNA (ssDNA). BRCA2 acts by targeting RAD51 to ssDNA over double-stranded DNA, enabling RAD51 to displace replication protein-A (RPA) from ssDNA and stabilizing RAD51-ssDNA filaments by blocking ATP hydrolysis. BRCA2 does not anneal ssDNA complexed with RPA, implying it does not directly function in repair processes that involve ssDNA annealing. Our findings show that BRCA2 is a key mediator of homologous recombination, and they provide a molecular basis for understanding how this DNA repair process is disrupted by BRCA2 mutations, which lead to chromosomal instability and cancer.","[Jensen, Ryan B.; Carreira, Aura; Kowalczykowski, Stephen C.] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Microbiol, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Jensen, Ryan B.; Carreira, Aura; Kowalczykowski, Stephen C.] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Mol & Cellular Biol, Davis, CA 95616 USA","Kowalczykowski, SC (reprint author), Univ Calif Davis, Dept Microbiol, Davis, CA 95616 USA.",sckowalczykowski@ucdavis.edu,,,NIH [NIH GM 62653]; DOD [BC085223]; American Cancer Society [PF-05-225-01-GMC]; Ministerio de Educacion y Ciencia (Spain); American Cancer Society,"We thank D.

The line-of-sight-averaged velocity dispersions are typically five times higher than in today's disk galaxies. This suggests that gravitationally unstable, gas-rich disks in the early Universe are fuelled by cold, dense accreting gas flowing along cosmic filaments and penetrating hot galactic gas halos(9,10). These accreting flows, however, have not been observed(11), and cosmic accretion cannot power the observed level of turbulence(12). Here we report observations of a sample of rare, high-velocity-dispersion disk galaxies in the nearby Universe where cold accretion is unlikely to drive their high star formation rates. We find that their velocity dispersions are correlated with their star formation rates, but not their masses or gas fractions, which suggests that star formation is the energetic driver of galaxy disk turbulence at all cosmic epochs.","[Green, Andrew W.; Glazebrook, Karl; Poole, Gregory B.] Swinburne Univ Technol, Ctr Astrophys & Supercomp, Hawthorn, Vic 3122, Australia; [McGregor, Peter J.] Australian Natl Univ, Res Sch Astron & Astrophys, Weston, ACT 2611, Australia; [Abraham, Roberto G.; Damjanov, Ivana] Univ Toronto, Dept Astron & Astrophys, Toronto, ON M5S 3H4, Canada; [McCarthy, Patrick J.] Observ Carnegie Inst Washington, Pasadena, CA 91101 USA; [Colless, Matthew; Sharp, Robert G.] Australian Astron Observ, Epping, NSW 1710, Australia","Green, AW (reprint author), Swinburne Univ Technol, Ctr Astrophys & Supercomp, POB 218, Hawthorn, Vic 3122, Australia.",agreen@astro.swin.edu.au,"Glazebrook, Karl/N-3488-2015","Glazebrook, Karl/0000-0002-3254-9044; Green, Andrew/0000-0003-3052-0819; Colless, Matthew/0000-0001-9552-8075",Australian Research Council; Swinburne University of Technology; Anglo-Australian Observatory; ANU2.3-m telescope,A.W.G. and K.G. acknowledge financial support from the Australian Research Council.

Although this presents a significant challenge for the further scaling of microprocessors, it provides the potential for radical innovations in the form of spin-based quantum computers(2-4) and spintronic devices(5). An electron spin in silicon can represent a well-isolated quantum bit with long coherence times(6) because of the weak spin-orbit coupling(7) and the possibility of eliminating nuclear spins from the bulk crystal(8). However, the control of single electrons in silicon has proved challenging, and so far the observation and manipulation of a single spin has been impossible. Here we report the demonstration of single-shot, time-resolved readout of an electron spin in silicon. This has been performed in a device consisting of implanted phosphorus donors(9) coupled to a metaloxide-semiconductor single-electron transistor(10,11)-compatible with current microelectronic technology. We observed a spin lifetime of similar to 6 seconds at a magnetic field of 1.5 tesla, and achieved a spin readout fidelity better than 90 per cent.

Many sophisticated methodologies have been developed to counter the randomizing effect of Brownian motion in solution(3-10), but stable trapping of nanometre-sized objects remains challenging(8-10). Optical tweezers are widely used traps, but require sufficiently polarizable objects and thus are unable to manipulate small macromolecules. Confinement of single molecules has been achieved using electrokinetic feedback guided by tracking of a fluorescent label, but photophysical constraints limit the trap stiffness and lifetime(8). Here we show that a fluidic slit with appropriately tailored topography has a spatially modulated electrostatic potential that can trap and levitate charged objects in solution for up to several hours. We illustrate this principle with gold particles, polymer beads and lipid vesicles with diameters of tens of nanometres, which are all trapped without external intervention and independently of their mass and dielectric function. The stiffness and stability of our electrostatic trap is easily tuned by adjusting the system geometry and the ionic strength of the solution, and it lends itself to integration with other manipulation mechanisms. We anticipate that these features will allow its use for contact-free confinement of single proteins and macromolecules, and the sorting and fractionation of nanometre-sized objects or their assembly into high-density arrays.","[Krishnan, Madhavi; Mojarad, Nassiredin; Kukura, Philipp; Sandoghdar, Vahid] ETH, Phys Chem Lab, CH-8093 Zurich, Switzerland","Krishnan, M (reprint author), ETH, Phys Chem Lab, CH-8093 Zurich, Switzerland.",mkrishnan@ethz.ch,"Sandoghdar, Vahid/C-7390-2013; Krishnan, Madhavi/J-4217-2015","Krishnan, Madhavi/0000-0003-1274-7155; Kukura, Philipp/0000-0003-0136-7704",European Commission,"We thank A.

Radiation at ultraviolet wavelengths dissociates atmospheric molecules, initiating chains of chemical reactions-specifically those producing stratospheric ozone-and providing the major source of heating for the middle atmosphere, while radiation at visible and near-infrared wavelengths mainly reaches and warms the lower atmosphere and the Earth's surface(1). Thus the spectral composition of solar radiation is crucial in determining atmospheric structure, as well as surface temperature, and it follows that the response of the atmosphere to variations in solar irradiance depends on the spectrum(2). Daily measurements of the solar spectrum between 0.2 mu m and 2.4 mu m, made by the Spectral Irradiance Monitor (SIM) instrument on the Solar Radiation and Climate Experiment (SORCE) satellite(3) since April 2004, have revealed(4) that over this declining phase of the solar cycle there was a four to six times larger decline in ultraviolet than would have been predicted on the basis of our previous understanding. This reduction was partially compensated in the total solar output by an increase in radiation at visible wavelengths. Here we show that these spectral changes appear to have led to a significant decline from 2004 to 2007 in stratospheric ozone below an altitude of 45 km, with an increase above this altitude. Our results, simulated with a radiative-photochemical model, are consistent with contemporaneous measurements of ozone from the Aura-MLS satellite, although the short time period makes precise attribution to solar effects difficult. We also show, using the SIM data, that solar radiative forcing of surface climate is out of phase with solar activity.

Fundamental aspects of this system, in particular the processes by which melt forms and travels to the Earth's surface, remain obscure. Systematics in the location of volcanic arcs, the surface expression of this melting, are widely considered to be a clue to processes taking place at depth, but many mutually incompatible interpretations of this clue exist (for example, see refs 1-6). We discriminate between those interpretations by the use of a simple scaling argument derived from a realistic mathematical model of heat transfer in subduction zones. The locations of the arcs cannot be explained by the release of fluids in reactions taking place near the top of the slab. Instead, the sharpness of the volcanic fronts, together with the systematics of their locations, requires that arcs must be located above the place where the boundary defined by the anhydrous solidus makes its closest approach to the trench. We show that heat carried by magma rising from this region is sufficient to modify the thermal structure of the wedge and determine the pathway through which both wet and dry melts reach the surface.","[England, Philip C.; Katz, Richard F.] Dept Earth Sci, Oxford OX1 3AN, England","England, PC (reprint author), Dept Earth Sci, S Parks Rd, Oxford OX1 3AN, England.",philip@earth.ox.ac.uk,"Katz, Richard/D-3364-2009; England, Philip/A-1920-2010","Katz, Richard/0000-0001-8746-5430; England, Philip/0000-0002-9024-8901",,,,38,55,56,4,49,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,7-Oct,2010,467,7316,,,,,700,U84,,10.1038/nature09417,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,659NE,WOS:000282572500036,20930842,No,,,11/20/17

Many such biotic shifts have been detected at mid-to high latitudes in the Northern Hemisphere(4,9,10)-a latitudinal pattern that is expected(4,8,10,11) because warming is fastest in these regions(8). In contrast, shifts in tropical regions are expected to be less marked(4,8,10,11) because warming is less pronounced there(8). However, biotic impacts of warming are mediated through physiology, and metabolic rate, which is a fundamental measure of physiological activity and ecological impact, increases exponentially rather than linearly with temperature in ectotherms(12). Therefore, tropical ectotherms (with warm baseline temperatures) should experience larger absolute shifts in metabolic rate than the magnitude of tropical temperature change itself would suggest, but the impact of climate warming on metabolic rate has never been quantified on a global scale. Here we show that estimated changes in terrestrial metabolic rates in the tropics are large, are equivalent in magnitude to those in the north temperate-zone regions, and are in fact far greater than those in the Arctic, even though tropical temperature change has been relatively small. Because of temperature's nonlinear effects on metabolism, tropical organisms, which constitute much of Earth's biodiversity, should be profoundly affected by recent and projected climate warming(2,13,14).","[Dillon, Michael E.] Univ Wyoming, Dept Zool & Physiol, Laramie, WY 82071 USA; [Wang, George; Huey, Raymond B.] Univ Washington, Dept Biol, Seattle, WA 98195 USA","Dillon, ME (reprint author), Univ Wyoming, Dept Zool & Physiol, Laramie, WY 82071 USA.",Michael.Dillon@uwyo.edu,"Dillon, Michael/A-2564-2012","Dillon, Michael/0000-0002-7263-5537; Huey, Raymond/0000-0002-4962-8670",NSF [IOB-041684],"We thank T.

Polyploidization occurs through failed cytokinesis, begins at weaning in rodents and increases with age(2,5-7). Previously, we demonstrated that the opposite event, ploidy reversal, also occurs in polyploid hepatocytes generated by artificial cell fusion(8-10). This raised the possibility that somatic 'reductive mitoses' can also happen in normal hepatocytes. Here we show that multipolar mitotic spindles form frequently in mouse polyploid hepatocytes and can result in one-step ploidy reversal to generate offspring with halved chromosome content. Proliferating hepatocytes produce a highly diverse population of daughter cells with multiple numerical chromosome imbalances as well as uniparental origins. Our findings support a dynamic model of hepatocyte polyploidization, ploidy reversal and aneuploidy, a phenomenon that we term the 'ploidy conveyor'. We propose that this mechanism evolved to generate genetic diversity and permits adaptation of hepatocytes to xenobiotic or nutritional injury.","[Duncan, Andrew W.; Hickey, Raymond D.; Grompe, Markus] Oregon Hlth & Sci Univ, Pape Family Pediat Res Inst, Oregon Stem Cell Ctr, Portland, OR 97239 USA; [Taylor, Matthew H.] Oregon Hlth & Sci Univ, Div Hematol & Med Oncol, Portland, OR 97239 USA; [Hickey, Raymond D.; Newell, Amy E.

During infection, C. difficile produces two key virulence determinants, toxin A and toxin B. Experiments with purified toxins have indicated that toxin A alone is able to evoke the symptoms of C. difficile infection, but toxin B is unable to do so unless it is mixed with toxin A or there is prior damage to the gut mucosa(3). However, a recent study indicated that toxin B is essential for C. difficile virulence and that a strain producing toxin A alone was avirulent(4). This creates a paradox over the individual importance of toxin A and toxin B. Here we show that isogenic mutants of C. difficile producing either toxin A or toxin B alone can cause fulminant disease in the hamster model of infection. By using a gene knockout system(5,6) to inactivate the toxin genes permanently, we found that C. difficile producing either one or both toxins showed cytotoxic activity in vitro that translated directly into virulence in vivo. Furthermore, by constructing the first ever double-mutant strain of C. difficile, in which both toxin genes were inactivated, we were able to completely attenuate virulence. Our findings re-establish the importance of both toxin A and toxin B and highlight the need to continue to consider both toxins in the development of diagnostic tests and effective countermeasures against C. difficile.","[Kuehne, Sarah A.; Cartman, Stephen T.; Heap, John T.; Kelly, Michelle L.; Cockayne, Alan; Minton, Nigel P.] Univ Nottingham, NIHR Biomed Res Unit, Nottingham Digest Dis Ctr, Sch Mol Med Sci,Ctr Biomol Sci,Clostridia Res Grp, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England","Minton, NP (reprint author), Univ Nottingham, NIHR Biomed Res Unit, Nottingham Digest Dis Ctr, Sch Mol Med Sci,Ctr Biomol Sci,Clostridia Res Grp, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England.",nigel.minton@nottingham.ac.uk,,"Minton, Nigel/0000-0002-9277-1261",UK Medical Research Council [G0601176]; European Union [HEALTH-F3-2008-223585]; Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC) [BB/F003390/1],"S.A.K., S.T.C., A.C. and N.P.M. acknowledge the financial support of the UK Medical Research Council (G0601176).

Centriole assembly and duplication is controlled by Polo-like-kinase 4 (Plk4): these processes fail if Plk4 is downregulated and are promoted by Plk4 overexpression(1-7). Here we show that the centriolar protein Asterless (Asl; human orthologue CEP152) provides a conserved molecular platform, the amino terminus of which interacts with the cryptic Polo box of Plk4 whereas the carboxy terminus interacts with the centriolar protein Sas-4 (CPAP in humans). Drosophila Asl and human CEP152 are required for the centrosomal loading of Plk4 in Drosophila and CPAP in human cells, respectively. Depletion of Asl or CEP152 caused failure of centrosome duplication; their overexpression led to de novo centriole formation in Drosophila eggs, duplication of free centrosomes in Drosophila embryos, and centrosome amplification in cultured Drosophila and human cells. Overexpression of a Plk4-binding-deficient mutant of Asl prevented centriole duplication in cultured cells and embryos. However, this mutant protein was able to promote microtubule organizing centre (MTOC) formation in both embryos and oocytes. Such MTOCs had pericentriolar material and the centriolar protein Sas-4, but no centrioles at their core. Formation of such acentriolar MTOCs could be phenocopied by overexpression of Sas-4 in oocytes or embryos. Our findings identify independent functions for Asl as a scaffold for Plk4 and Sas-4 that facilitates self-assembly and duplication of the centriole and organization of pericentriolar material.","[Dzhindzhev, Nikola S.; Yu, Quan D.; Weiskopf, Kipp; Tzolovsky, George; Cunha-Ferreira, Ines; Rodrigues-Martins, Ana; Glover, David M.] Univ Cambridge, Dept Genet, Canc Res UK Cell Cycle Genet Grp, Cambridge CB2 3EH, England; [Tzolovsky, George; Riparbelli, Maria; Rodrigues-Martins, Ana; Glover, David M.] Inst Gulbenkian Ciencias, P-2780156 Oeiras, Portugal; [Riparbelli, Maria; Callaini, Giuliano] Univ Siena, Dipartimento Biol Evolut, I-53100 Siena, Italy","Dzhindzhev, NS (reprint author), Univ Cambridge, Dept Genet, Canc Res UK Cell Cycle Genet Grp, Downing St, Cambridge CB2 3EH, England.",nsd23@cam.ac.uk; dmg25@cam.ac.uk,"Bettencourt-Dias, Monica/B-5176-2015","Bettencourt-Dias, Monica/0000-0003-1987-5598; Glover, David/0000-0003-0956-0103",Cancer Research UK; Fundacao Calouste Gulbenkian; Fundacao para a Ciencia e Tecnologia (FCT); Royal Society,"We thank E.

Any defects in this regulation bring about chromosomal instability, which may accelerate tumour progression in humans. To achieve chromosome bi-orientation at prometaphase, the chromosomal passenger complex (CPC), composed of catalytic kinase Aurora B and regulatory components (INCENP, Survivin and Borealin), must be localized to centromeres to phosphorylate kinetochore substrates(1-7). Although the CPC dynamically changes the subcellular localization, the regulation of centromere targeting is largely unknown(1). Here we isolated a fission yeast cyclin B mutant defective specifically in chromosome bi-orientation. Accordingly, we identified Cdk1 (also known as Cdc2)-cyclin-B-dependent phosphorylation of Survivin. Preventing Survivin phosphorylation impairs centromere CPC targeting as well as chromosome bi-orientation, whereas phosphomimetic Survivin suppresses the bi-orientation defect in the cyclin B mutant. Survivin phosphorylation promotes direct binding with shugoshin(8,9), which we now define as a conserved centromeric adaptor of the CPC. In human cells, the phosphorylation of Borealin has a comparable role. Thus, our study resolves the conserved mechanisms of CPC targeting to centromeres, highlighting a key role of Cdk1-cyclin B in chromosome bi-orientation.","[Tsukahara, Tatsuya; Watanabe, Yoshinori] Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Sci, Grad Program Biophys & Biochem, Tokyo 1130032, Japan; [Tsukahara, Tatsuya; Tanno, Yuji; Watanabe, Yoshinori] Univ Tokyo, Inst Mol & Cellular Biosci, Lab Chromosome Dynam, Tokyo 1130032, Japan","Watanabe, Y (reprint author), Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Sci, Grad Program Biophys & Biochem, Tokyo 1130032, Japan.",ywatanab@iam.u-tokyo.ac.jp,,,"Global COE Program (Integrative Life Science Based on the Study of Biosignaling Mechanisms); JSPS; MEXT, Japan","We thank S.

Actin is a ubiquitous protein and is involved in important biological functions, but the definitive high-resolution structure of F-actin remains unknown. Although a recent atomic model well reproduced X-ray fibre diffraction intensity data from a highly oriented liquid-crystalline sol specimen(3), its refinement without experimental phase information has certain limitations. Direct visualization of the structure by electron cryomicroscopy, however, has been difficult because it is relatively thin and flexible. Here we report the F-actin structure at 6.6 angstrom resolution, made obtainable by recent advances in electron cryomicroscopy. The density map clearly resolves all the secondary structures of G-actin, such as alpha-helices, beta-structures and loops, and makes unambiguous modelling and refinement possible.

Symplekin mediates interactions between many different proteins in this machinery(1,2,7-9), although the molecular basis for its function is not known. Here we report the crystal structure at 2.4 angstrom resolution of the amino-terminal domain (residues 30-340) of human symplekin in a ternary complex with the Pol II carboxyterminal domain (CTD) Ser 5 phosphatase Ssu72 (refs 7, 10-17) and a CTD Ser 5 phosphopeptide. The N-terminal domain of symplekin has the ARM or HEAT fold, with seven pairs of antiparallel a-helices arranged in the shape of an arc. The structure of Ssu72 has some similarity to that of low-molecular-mass phosphotyrosine protein phosphatase(18,19), although Ssu72 has a unique active-site landscape as well as extra structural features at the C terminus that are important for interaction with symplekin. Ssu72 is bound to the concave face of symplekin, and engineered mutations in this interface can abolish interactions between the two proteins. The CTD peptide is bound in the active site of Ssu72, with the pSer 5-Pro 6 peptide bond in the cis configuration, which contrasts with all other known CTD peptide conformations(20,21). Although the active site of Ssu72 is about 25 angstrom from the interface with symplekin, we found that the symplekin N-terminal domain stimulates Ssu72 CTD phosphatase activity in vitro. Furthermore, the N-terminal domain of symplekin inhibits polyadenylation in vitro, but only when coupled to transcription. Because catalytically active Ssu72 overcomes this inhibition, our results show a role for mammalian Ssu72 in transcription-coupled pre-mRNA 3'-end processing.","[Xiang, Kehui; Nagaike, Takashi; Xiang, Song; Kilic, Turgay; Beh, Maia M.; Manley, James L.; Tong, Liang] Columbia Univ, Dept Biol Sci, New York, NY 10027 USA","Tong, LA (reprint author), Columbia Univ, Dept Biol Sci, New York, NY 10027 USA.",ltong@columbia.edu,,"Tong, Liang/0000-0002-0563-6468; Manley, James/0000-0002-8341-1459; xiang (Xiang), song (Song)/0000-0001-9314-4684","National Institutes of Health [GM077175, GM028983]",We thank F.

In Escherichia coli, the uptake of L-fucose, a source of carbon for microorganisms, is mediated by an MFS proton symporter, FucP(2,3). Despite intensive study of the MFS transporters, atomic structure information is only available on three proteins and the outward-open conformation has yet to be captured(4-6). Here we report the crystal structure of FucP at 3.1 angstrom resolution, which shows that it contains an outward-open, amphipathic cavity. The similarly folded amino and carboxyl domains of FucP have contrasting surface features along the transport path, with negative electrostatic potential on the N domain and hydrophobic surface on the C domain. FucP only contains two acidic residues along the transport path, Asp 46 and Glu 135, which can undergo cycles of protonation and deprotonation. Their essential role in active transport is supported by both in vivo and in vitro experiments. Structure-based biochemical analyses provide insights into energy coupling, substrate recognition and the transport mechanism of FucP.","[Wang, Jiawei] Tsinghua Univ, Sch Life Sci, Struct Biol Ctr, State Key Lab Biomembrane & Membrane Biotechnol, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China; Tsinghua Univ, Sch Med, Struct Biol Ctr, State Key Lab Biomembrane & Membrane Biotechnol, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China","Wang, JW (reprint author), Tsinghua Univ, Sch Life Sci, Struct Biol Ctr, State Key Lab Biomembrane & Membrane Biotechnol, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China.",jwwang@tsinghua.edu.cn; nyan@tsinghua.edu.cn,,,Ministry of Science and Technology [2009CB918802]; Tsinghua University [985]; Yuyuan Foundation; Li Foundation,"We thank N.

Here we develop a single-genome amplification strategy to identify and characterize Plasmodium spp. DNA sequences in faecal samples from wild-living apes. Among nearly 3,000 specimens collected from field sites throughout central Africa, we found Plasmodium infection in chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) and western gorillas (Gorilla gorilla), but not in eastern gorillas (Gorilla beringei) or bonobos (Pan paniscus). Ape plasmodial infections were highly prevalent, widely distributed and almost always made up of mixed parasite species. Analysis of more than 1,100 mitochondrial, apicoplast and nuclear gene sequences from chimpanzees and gorillas revealed that 99% grouped within one of six host-specific lineages representing distinct Plasmodium species within the subgenus Laverania. One of these from western gorillas comprised parasites that were nearly identical to P. falciparum. In phylogenetic analyses of full-length mitochondrial sequences, human P. falciparum formed a monophyletic lineage within the gorilla parasite radiation. These findings indicate that P. falciparum is of gorilla origin and not of chimpanzee, bonobo or ancient human origin.","[Liu, Weimin; Li, Yingying; Learn, Gerald H.; Robertson, Joel D.; Keele, Brandon F.; Shaw, George M.; Rayner, Julian C.; Hahn, Beatrice H.] Univ Alabama, Dept Med, Birmingham, AL 35294 USA; [Rudicell, Rebecca S.; Shaw, George M.; Hahn, Beatrice H.] Univ Alabama, Dept Microbiol, Birmingham, AL 35294 USA; [Ndjango, Jean-Bosco N.] Univ Kisangani, Dept Ecol & Management Plant & Anim Resources, Fac Sci, Kisangani, Congo; [Sanz, Crickette M.] Washington Univ, Dept Anthropol, St Louis, MO 63130 USA; [Sanz, Crickette M.; Morgan, David B.] Wildlife Conservat Soc, Congo Program, Brazzaville, Congo; [Morgan, David B.] Lester E Fisher Ctr Study & Conservat Apes, Chicago, IL 60614 USA; [Locatelli, Sabrina; Gonder, Mary K.] SUNY Albany, Dept Biol Sci, Albany, NY 12222 USA; [Kranzusch, Philip J.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Microbiol & Mol Genet, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Walsh, Peter D.] VaccinApe, Bethesda, MD USA; [Delaporte, Eric; Peeters, Martine] Univ Montpellier 1, F-34394 Montpellier, France; [Delaporte, Eric; Peeters, Martine] Inst Rech Dev, F-34394 Montpellier, France; [Mpoudi-Ngole, Eitel] Ctr Rech Med, Inst Rech Med & Etud Plantes Med Prevent Sida Cam, Yaounde, Cameroon; [Georgiev, Alexander V.] Harvard Univ, Dept Human Evolutionary Biol, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Muller, Martin N.] Univ New Mexico, Dept Anthropol, Albuquerque, NM 87131 USA; [Sharp, Paul M.] Univ Edinburgh, Inst Evolutionary Biol, Edinburgh EH9 3JT, Midlothian, Scotland; [Sharp, Paul M.] Univ Edinburgh, Ctr Immun Infect & Evolut, Edinburgh EH9 3JT, Midlothian, Scotland; [Rayner, Julian C.] Wellcome Trust Sanger Inst, Sanger Inst, Malaria Programme, Cambridge CB10 1SA, England","Hahn, BH (reprint author), Univ Alabama, Dept Med, Birmingham, AL 35294 USA.",bhahn@uab.edu,"Sharp, Paul/F-5783-2010","Sharp, Paul/0000-0001-9771-543X; Rayner, Julian/0000-0002-9835-1014; Locatelli, Sabrina/0000-0002-1133-0561; Georgiev, Alexander/0000-0001-5622-3826","National Institutes of Health [R01 AI50529, R01 AI58715, U19 AI 067854, R03 AI074778, T32 GM008111, T32 AI007245, P30 AI 27767]; Bill&Melinda Gates Foundation [37874]; National Science Foundation [0755823]; Agence Nationale de Recherche sur le Sida [12152/12182]; US Fish and Wildlife Service; Arthur L.

Typhimurium) causes acute gut inflammation by using its virulence factors to invade the intestinal epithelium and survive in mucosal macrophages. The inflammatory response enhances the transmission success of S. Typhimurium by promoting its outgrowth in the gut lumen through unknown mechanisms. Here we show that reactive oxygen species generated during inflammation react with endogenous, luminal sulphur compounds (thiosulphate) to form a new respiratory electron acceptor, tetrathionate. The genes conferring the ability to use tetrathionate as an electron acceptor produce a growth advantage for S. Typhimurium over the competing microbiota in the lumen of the inflamed gut. We conclude that S. Typhimurium virulence factors induce host-driven production of a new electron acceptor that allows the pathogen to use respiration to compete with fermenting gut microbes. Thus the ability to trigger intestinal inflammation is crucial for the biology of this diarrhoeal pathogen.","[Winter, Sebastian E.; Thiennimitr, Parameth; Winter, Maria G.; Butler, Brian P.; Crawford, Robert W.; Russell, Joseph M.; Bevins, Charles L.; Tsolis, Renee M.; Baeumler, Andreas J.] Univ Calif Davis, Sch Med, Dept Med Microbiol & Immunol, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Thiennimitr, Parameth] Chiang Mai Univ, Fac Med, Dept Microbiol, Chiang Mai 50000, Thailand; [Huseby, Douglas L.; Roth, John R.] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Microbiol, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Adams, L.

Gene activation may involve DNA loop formation between enhancer-bound transcription factors and the transcription apparatus at the core promoter, but this process is not well understood. Here we report that mediator and cohesin physically and functionally connect the enhancers and core promoters of active genes in murine embryonic stem cells. Mediator, a transcriptional coactivator, forms a complex with cohesin, which can form rings that connect two DNA segments. The cohesin-loading factor Nipbl is associated with mediator-cohesin complexes, providing a means to load cohesin at promoters. DNA looping is observed between the enhancers and promoters occupied by mediator and cohesin. Mediator and cohesin co-occupy different promoters in different cells, thus generating cell-type-specific DNA loops linked to the gene expression program of each cell.","[Kagey, Michael H.; Newman, Jamie J.; Bilodeau, Steve; Orlando, David A.; Rahl, Peter B.; Young, Richard A.] Whitehead Inst Biomed Res, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; [Newman, Jamie J.; Levine, Stuart S.; Young, Richard A.] MIT, Dept Biol, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Zhan, Ye; van Berkum, Nynke L.; Dekker, Job] Univ Massachusetts, Sch Med, Dept Biochem & Mol Pharmacol, Worcester, MA 01605 USA; [Zhan, Ye; van Berkum, Nynke L.; Dekker, Job] Univ Massachusetts, Sch Med, Program Gene Funct & Express, Worcester, MA 01605 USA; [Ebmeier, Christopher C.; Goossens, Jesse; Taatjes, Dylan J.] Univ Colorado, Dept Chem & Biochem, Boulder, CO 80309 USA","Young, RA (reprint author), Whitehead Inst Biomed Res, 9 Cambridge Ctr, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA.",Dylan.Taatjes@Colorado.EDU; young@wi.mit.edu,"Taatjes, Dylan/G-2027-2011; Young, Richard/F-6495-2012","Young, Richard/0000-0001-8855-8647; Bilodeau, Steve/0000-0002-9799-3832","NIH [HG003143, HG002668]; Canadian Institutes of Health Research; American Cancer Society; Keck Distinguished young scholar award","We thank T.

It can deliver the three-dimensional internal structure of entire organisms as well as that of single cells, and even gives access to quantitative information, crucially important both for medical applications and for basic research(1-4). Most frequently such information is based on X-ray attenuation. Phase contrast is sometimes used for improved visibility but remains significantly harder to quantify(5,6). Here we describe an X-ray computed tomography technique that generates quantitative high-contrast three-dimensional electron density maps from phase contrast information without reverting to assumptions of a weak phase object or negligible absorption. This method uses a ptychographic coherent imaging approach to record tomographic data sets, exploiting both the high penetration power of hard X-rays and the high sensitivity of lensless imaging(7-9). As an example, we present images of a bone sample in which structures on the 100 nm length scale such as the osteocyte lacunae and the interconnective canalicular network are clearly resolved. The recovered electron density map provides a contrast high enough to estimate nanoscale bone density variations of less than one per cent. We expect this high-resolution tomography technique to provide invaluable information for both the life and materials sciences.","[Dierolf, Martin; Thibault, Pierre; Pfeiffer, Franz] Tech Univ Munich, Dept Phys E17, D-85748 Garching, Germany; [Menzel, Andreas; Kewish, Cameron M.; Bunk, Oliver] Paul Scherrer Inst, Swiss Light Source, CH-5232 Villigen, Switzerland; [Schneider, Philipp] ETH, Inst Biomech, CH-8093 Zurich, Switzerland; [Wepf, Roger] EMEZ, CH-8093 Zurich, Switzerland","Thibault, P (reprint author), Tech Univ Munich, Dept Phys E17, D-85748 Garching, Germany.",pierre.thibault@tum.de,"Kewish, Cameron/H-5103-2011; Dierolf, Martin/B-9816-2008; Bunk, Oliver/B-7602-2013; Thibault, Pierre/B-2656-2010; Menzel, Andreas/C-4388-2012","Kewish, Cameron/0000-0001-6242-7059; Dierolf, Martin/0000-0001-5150-2949; Bunk, Oliver/0000-0001-6563-4053; Menzel, Andreas/0000-0002-0489-609X","DFG Cluster of Excellence ""Munich-Centre for Advanced Photonics""","We acknowledge technical support by X.

The high quantum yield of 0.65 (ref. 2), the production of the primary ground-state rhodopsin photoproduct within a mere 200 fs (refs 3-7), and the storage of considerable energy in the first stable bathorhodopsin intermediate(8) all suggest an unusually fast and efficient photoactivated one-way reaction(9). Rhodopsin's unique reactivity is generally attributed to a conical intersection between the potential energy surfaces of the ground and excited electronic states(10,11) enabling the efficient and ultrafast conversion of photon energy into chemical energy(12-16). But obtaining direct experimental evidence for the involvement of a conical intersection is challenging: the energy gap between the electronic states of the reacting molecule changes significantly over an ultrashort time-scale, which calls for observational methods that combine high temporal resolution with a broad spectral observation window. Here we show that ultrafast optical spectroscopy with sub-20-fs time resolution and spectral coverage from the visible to the near-infrared allows us to follow the dynamics leading to the conical intersection in rhodopsin isomerization. We track coherent wave-packet motion from the photoexcited Franck-Condon region to the photoproduct by monitoring the loss of reactant emission and the subsequent appearance of photoproduct absorption, and find excellent agreement between the experimental observations and molecular dynamics calculations that involve a true electronic state crossing. Taken together, these findings constitute the most compelling evidence to date for the existence and importance of conical intersections in visual photochemistry.","[Altoe, Piero; Tomasello, Gaia; Orlandi, Giorgio; Garavelli, Marco] Univ Bologna, Dipartimento Chim G Ciamician, I-40126 Bologna, Italy; [Polli, Dario; Manzoni, Cristian; Brida, Daniele; Cerullo, Giulio] Politecn Milan, IFN, CNR, Dipartimento Fis, I-20133 Milan, Italy; [Weingart, Oliver] Univ Duisburg Essen, Lehrstuhl Theoret Chem, D-45117 Essen, Germany; [Weingart, Oliver] Max Planck Inst Kohlenforsch, D-45470 Mulheim, Germany; [Spillane, Katelyn M.; Mathies, Richard A.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Chem, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Kukura, Philipp] Univ Oxford, Dept Chem, Phys & Theoret Chem Lab, Oxford OX1 3QZ, England","Garavelli, M (reprint author), Univ Bologna, Dipartimento Chim G Ciamician, Via F Selmi 2, I-40126 Bologna, Italy.",marco.garavelli@unibo.it; giulio.cerullo@fisi.polimi.it,"Polli, Dario/B-4809-2011; Manzoni, Cristian/F-6669-2011; Cerullo, Giulio/F-6534-2011; Brida, Daniele/A-9301-2010; GARAVELLI, MARCO/P-5510-2015; Weingart, Oliver/P-9920-2017","Polli, Dario/0000-0002-6960-5708; Manzoni, Cristian/0000-0002-4169-8869; Brida, Daniele/0000-0003-2060-5480; GARAVELLI, MARCO/0000-0002-0796-289X; Weingart, Oliver/0000-0001-6033-3702; Cerullo, Giulio/0000-0002-9534-2702; Kukura, Philipp/0000-0003-0136-7704",DFG [FOR490]; PRIN programme [2008JKBBK4]; UK Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council [EP/H003541/1],"M.G., O.W., G.O., G.

The warming-cooling-warming pattern of twentieth-century temperatures is typically interpreted as the superposition of long-term warming due to increasing greenhouse gases and either cooling due to a mid-twentieth century increase of sulphate aerosols in the troposphere(2-4), or changes in the climate of the world's oceans that evolve over decades (oscillatory multidecadal variability)(2,5). Loadings of sulphate aerosol in the troposphere are thought to have had a particularly important role in the differences in temperature trends between the Northern and Southern hemispheres during the decades following the Second World War(2-4). Here we show that the hemispheric differences in temperature trends in the middle of the twentieth century stem largely from a rapid drop in Northern Hemisphere sea surface temperatures of about 0.3 degrees C between about 1968 and 1972. The timescale of the drop is shorter than that associated with either tropospheric aerosol loadings or previous characterizations of oscillatory multidecadal variability.

The reason for differentiation at the lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary is currently being debated with relevant observations from geophysics (including seismology) and geo-chemistry (including experimental petrology). Water is thought to have an important effect on mantle rheology, either by weakening the crystal structure of olivine and pyroxenes by dilute solid solution(1), or by causing low-temperature partial melting(2). Here we present a novel experimental approach to clarify the role of water in the uppermost mantle at pressures up to 6 GPa, equivalent to a depth of 190 km. We found that for lherzolite in which a water-rich vapour is present, the temperature at which a silicate melt first appears (the vapour-saturated solidus) increases from a minimum of 970 degrees C at 1.5 GPa to 1,350 degrees C at 6 GPa. We have measured the water content in lherzolite to be approximately 180 parts per million, retained in nominally anhydrous minerals at 2.5 and 4 GPa at temperatures above and below the vapour-saturated solidus. The hydrous mineral pargasite is the main water-storage site in the uppermost mantle, and the instability of pargasite at pressures greater than 3 GPa (equivalent to more than about 90 km depth) causes a sharp drop in both the water-storage capacity and the solidus temperature of fertile upper-mantle lherzolite. The presence of interstitial melt in mantle with more than 180 parts per million of water at pressures greater than 3 GPa alters mantle rheology and defines the lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary. Modern asthenospheric mantle acting as the source for mid-oceanic ridge basalts has a water content of 50-200 parts per million (refs 3-5). We show that this matches the water content of residual nominally anhydrous minerals after incipient melting of lherzolite at the vapour-saturated solidus at high pressure.","[Green, David H.] Univ Tasmania, Sch Earth Sci, Hobart, Tas 7001, Australia; [Green, David H.] Univ Tasmania, Ctr Ore Deposit Studies, Hobart, Tas 7001, Australia; [Green, David H.; Hibberson, William O.; Kovacs, Istvan; Rosenthal, Anja] Australian Natl Univ, Res Sch Earth Sci, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia; [Kovacs, Istvan] Eotvos Lorand Geophys Inst Hungary, Dept Data Management, H-1145 Budapest, Hungary","Green, DH (reprint author), Univ Tasmania, Sch Earth Sci, Hobart, Tas 7001, Australia.",David.H.Green@utas.edu.au,"Kovacs, Istvan/A-1267-2008; Rosenthal, Anja/J-9393-2014; Green, David/A-5288-2008","Kovacs, Istvan/0000-0002-3488-3716; Green, David/0000-0002-5290-2087",Australian Research Council; A.E.

Even with much experimental effort(2-12), the weakening mechanisms have remained enigmatic. Here we present evidence for dynamic weakening of experimental faults that are sheared at velocities approaching earthquake slip rates. The experimental faults, which were made of room-dry, solid granite blocks, quickly wore to form a fine-grain rock powder known as gouge. At modest slip velocities of 10-60 mm s(-1), this newly formed gouge organized itself into a thin deforming layer that reduced the fault's strength by a factor of 2-3. After slip, the gouge rapidly 'aged' and the fault regained its strength in a matter of hours to days. Therefore, only newly formed gouge can weaken the experimental faults. Dynamic gouge formation is expected to be a common and effective mechanism of earthquake instability in the brittle crust as (1) gouge always forms during fault slip(5,10,12-20); (2) fault-gouge behaves similarly to industrial powder lubricants(21); (3) dynamic gouge formation explains various significant earthquake properties; and (4) gouge lubricant can form for a wide range of fault configurations, compositions and temperatures(15).","[Reches, Ze'ev] Univ Oklahoma, Sch Geol & Geophys, Norman, OK 73019 USA; [Lockner, David A.] US Geol Survey, Menlo Pk, CA 94025 USA","Reches, Z (reprint author), Univ Oklahoma, Sch Geol & Geophys, 100 E Boyd St, Norman, OK 73019 USA.",reches@ou.edu; lockner@usgs.gov,,,National Science Foundation [0732715],"We thank J.

Some of these phenomena, such as the scaling of demographic variance, are related to small size(3-6) whereas others result from density-dependent nonlinearities(7). Although understanding the causes of population extinction has been a central problem in theoretical biology for decades(8), the ability to anticipate extinction has remained elusive(9). Here we argue that the causes of a population's decline are central to the predictability of its extinction. Specifically, environmental degradation may cause a tipping point in population dynamics, corresponding to a bifurcation in the underlying population growth equations, beyond which decline to extinction is almost certain. In such cases, imminent extinction will be signalled by critical slowing down (CSD). We conducted an experiment with replicate laboratory populations of Daphnia magna to test this hypothesis. We show that populations crossing a transcritical bifurcation, experimentally induced by the controlled decline in environmental conditions, show statistical signatures of CSD after the onset of environmental deterioration and before the critical transition. Populations in constant environments did not have these patterns. Four statistical indicators all showed evidence of the approaching bifurcation as early as 110 days (similar to 8 generations) before the transition occurred. Two composite indices improved predictability, and comparative analysis showed that early warning signals based solely on observations in deteriorating environments without reference populations for standardization were hampered by the presence of transient dynamics before the onset of deterioration, pointing to the importance of reliable baseline data before environmental deterioration begins. The universality of bifurcations in models of population dynamics suggests that this phenomenon should be general(10-12).","[Drake, John M.] Univ Georgia, Odum Sch Ecol, Athens, GA 30602 USA; [Griffen, Blaine D.] Univ S Carolina, Dept Biol Sci, Columbia, SC 29208 USA","Drake, JM (reprint author), Univ Georgia, Odum Sch Ecol, Athens, GA 30602 USA.",jdrake@uga.edu,"Drake, John/D-6622-2012","Drake, John/0000-0003-4646-1235","Odum School of Ecology, University of Georgia; University of South Carolina","G.

Recent advances in rat genomics are facilitating systems-genetics approaches(1,2). Here we report the use of integrated genome-wide approaches across seven rat tissues to identify gene networks and the loci underlying their regulation. We defined an interferon regulatory factor 7 (IRF7(3))-driven inflammatory network (IDIN) enriched for viral response genes, which represents a molecular biomarker for macrophages and which was regulated in multiple tissues by a locus on rat chromosome 15q25. We show that Epstein-Barr virus induced gene 2 (Ebi2, also known as Gpr183), which lies at this locus and controls B lymphocyte migration(4,5), is expressed in macrophages and regulates the IDIN. The human orthologous locus on chromosome 13q32 controlled the human equivalent of the IDIN, which was conserved in monocytes. IDIN genes were more likely to associate with susceptibility to type 1 diabetes (T1D)-amacrophage-associated autoimmune disease-than randomly selected immune response genes (P = 8.85 x 10(-6)). The human locus controlling the IDIN was associated with the risk of T1D at single nucleotide polymorphism rs9585056 (P = 7.0 x 10(-10); odds ratio, 1.15), which was one of five single nucleotide polymorphisms in this region associated with EBI2 (GPR183) expression. These data implicate IRF7 network genes and their regulatory locus in the pathogenesis of T1D.","[Heinig, Matthias; Bauerfeind, Anja; Hummel, Oliver; Lee, Young-Ae; Paskas, Svetlana; Rintisch, Carola;

To detect its cognate antigen, each B cell contains up to 120,000 B-cell antigen receptor (BCR) complexes on its cell surface. How these abundant receptors stay silent on resting B cells and how they can be activated by a molecularly diverse set of ligands is poorly understood(1). Here we show, with the use of a quantitative bifluorescence complementation assay (BiFC)(2,3), that the BCR has an intrinsic ability to form oligomers on the surface of living cells. A BCR mutant that fails to form oligomers is more active and cannot be expressed stably on the B-cell surface, whereas BiFC-stabilized BCR oligomers are less active and more strongly expressed on the surface. We propose that oligomers are the autoinhibited form of the BCR and that it is the shift from closed BCR oligomers to clustered monomers that drives B-cell activation in a way that is independent of the structural input from the antigen.","[Yang, Jianying; Reth, Michael] Univ Freiburg, Ctr Biol Signalling Studies BIOSS, Dept Mol Immunol, Fac Biol, D-79108 Freiburg, Germany; [Yang, Jianying; Reth, Michael] Max Planck Inst Immunobiol, D-79108 Freiburg, Germany","Reth, M (reprint author), Univ Freiburg, Ctr Biol Signalling Studies BIOSS, Dept Mol Immunol, Fac Biol, Stubeweg 51, D-79108 Freiburg, Germany.",michael.reth@bioss.uni-freiburg.de,,"YANG, JIANYING/0000-0001-8197-5413",Excellence Initiative of the German Federal and State Governments [EXC 294]; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft [SFB746]; FRISYS,"We thank L.

In bacteria, these 'non-stop proteins' become co-translationally tagged with a peptide encoded by ssrA/tmRNA (transfer-messenger RNA), which signals their degradation by energy-dependent proteases(1,3). How eukaryotic cells eliminate non-stop proteins has remained unknown. Here we show that the Saccharomyces cerevisiae Ltn1 RING-domain-type E3 ubiquitin ligase acts in the quality control of non-stop proteins, in a process that is mechanistically distinct but conceptually analogous to that performed by ssrA: Ltn1 is predominantly associated with ribosomes, and it marks nascent non-stop proteins with ubiquitin to signal their proteasomal degradation. Ltn1-mediated ubiquitylation of non-stop proteins seems to be triggered by their stalling in ribosomes on translation through the poly(A) tail. The biological relevance of this process is underscored by the finding that loss of Ltn1 function confers sensitivity to stress caused by increased non-stop protein production. We speculate that defective protein quality control may underlie the neurodegenerative phenotype that results from mutation of the mouse Ltn1 homologue Listerin.","[Bengtson, Mario H.; Joazeiro, Claudio A.

CDK phosphorylation of two key initiation factors, Sld2 and Sld3, promotes essential interactions with Dpb11 (refs 2-4), whereas DDK acts by phosphorylating subunits of the Mcm2-7 helicase(5). CDK has an additional role in replication by preventing the re-loading of Mcm2-7 during the S, G2 and M phases(6), thus preventing origin re-firing and re-replication. During the G1 phase, both CDK and DDK are downregulated, which allows origin licensing and prevents premature replication initiation(3). Origin firing is also inhibited during the S phase when DNA damage or replication fork stalling activates the checkpoint kinases(7-10). Here we show that, analogous to the situation in the G1 phase, the Saccharomyces cerevisiae checkpoint kinase Rad53 inhibits both CDK- and DDK-dependent pathways, which acts redundantly to block further origin firing. Rad53 acts on DDK directly by phosphorylating Dbf4, whereas the CDK pathway is blocked by Rad53-mediated phosphorylation of the downstream CDK substrate, Sld3. This allows CDK to remain active during the S phase in the presence of DNA damage, which is crucial to prevent re-loading of Mcm2-7 onto origins that have already fired(6). Our results explain how checkpoints regulate origin firing and demonstrate that the slowing of S phase by the 'intra-S checkpoint' is primarily due to the inhibition of origin firing.","[Zegerman, Philip; Diffley, John F.

However, in response to DNA damage or replication fork stalling, eukaryotic cells block activation of unfired origins. Human cells derived from patients with ataxia telangiectasia are deficient in this process due to the lack of a functional ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) kinase and elicit radioresistant DNA synthesis(1-3) after gamma-irradiation(2). This effect is conserved in budding yeast, as yeast cells lacking the related kinase Mec1 (ATM and Rad3-related (ATR in humans)) also fail to inhibit DNA synthesis in the presence of DNA damage(4). This intra-S-phase checkpoint actively regulates DNA synthesis by inhibiting the firing of late replicating origins, and this inhibition requires both Mec1 and the downstream checkpoint kinase Rad53 (Chk2 in humans)(5,6). However, the Rad53 substrate(s) whose phosphorylation is required to mediate this function has remained unknown. Here we show that the replication initiation protein Sld3 is phosphorylated by Rad53, and that this phosphorylation, along with phosphorylation of the Cdc7 kinase regulatory subunit Dbf4, blocks late origin firing in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Upon exposure to DNA-damaging agents, cells expressing non-phosphorylatable alleles of SLD3 and DBF4 (SLD3-m25 and dbf4-m25, respectively) proceed through the S phase faster than wild-type cells by inappropriately firing late origins of replication. SLD3-m25 dbf4-m25 cells grow poorly in the presence of the replication inhibitor hydroxyurea and accumulate multiple Rad52 foci. Moreover, SLD3-m25 dbf4-m25 cells are delayed in recovering from transient blocks to replication and subsequently arrest at the DNA damage checkpoint. These data indicate that the intra-S-phase checkpoint functions to block late origin firing in adverse conditions to prevent genomic instability and maximize cell survival.","[Lopez-Mosqueda, Jaime; Maas, Nancy L.; DeFazio-Eli, Lisa G.; Toczyski, David P.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Biochem & Biophys, San Francisco, CA 94158 USA; [Jonsson, Zophonias O.; Wohlschlegel, James] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Biol Chem, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA","Toczyski, DP (reprint author), Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Biochem & Biophys, San Francisco, CA 94158 USA.",toczyski@cc.ucsf.edu,"Jonsson, Zophonias/E-1960-2015",,Ford Foundation; National Institutes of Health [GM059691],"We would like to thank members of the Toczyski, Morgan, Li and O'Farrell laboratories for discussions.

The efflux system CusCBA is responsible for extruding biocidal Cu(I) and Ag(I) ions(3,4). No previous structural information was available for the heavy-metal efflux (HME) subfamily of the RND efflux pumps. Here we describe the crystal structures of the inner-membrane transporter CusA in the absence and presence of bound Cu(I) or Ag(I). These CusA structures provide new structural information about the HME subfamily of RND efflux pumps. The structures suggest that the metal-binding sites, formed by a three-methionine cluster, are located within the cleft region of the periplasmic domain. This cleft is closed in the apo-CusA form but open in the CusA-Cu(I) and CusA-Ag(I) structures, which directly suggests a plausible pathway for ion export. Binding of Cu(I) and Ag(I) triggers significant conformational changes in both the periplasmic and transmembrane domains. The crystal structure indicates that CusA has, in addition to the three-methionine metal-binding site, four methionine pairs-three located in the transmembrane region and one in the periplasmic domain. Genetic analysis and transport assays suggest that CusA is capable of actively picking up metal ions from the cytosol, using these methionine pairs or clusters to bind and export metal ions. These structures suggest a stepwise shuttle mechanism for transport between these sites.","[Long, Feng; Yu, Edward W.] Iowa State Univ, Mol Cellular & Dev Biol Interdept Grad Program, Ames, IA 50011 USA; [Su, Chih-Chia; Yu, Edward W.] Iowa State Univ, Dept Chem, Ames, IA 50011 USA; [Zimmermann, Michael T.; Boyken, Scott E.; Jernigan, Robert L.; Yu, Edward W.] Iowa State Univ, Bioinformat & Computat Biol Interdept Grad Progra, Ames, IA 50011 USA; [Rajashankar, Kanagalaghatta R.] Cornell Univ, Dept Chem & Chem Biol, Argonne Natl Lab, Argonne, IL 60439 USA; [Rajashankar, Kanagalaghatta R.] Cornell Univ, NE CAT, Argonne Natl Lab, Argonne, IL 60439 USA; [Jernigan, Robert L.; Yu, Edward W.] Iowa State Univ, Dept Biochem Biophys & Mol Biol, Ames, IA 50011 USA; [Yu, Edward W.] Iowa State Univ, Dept Phys & Astron, Ames, IA 50011 USA","Yu, EW (reprint author), Iowa State Univ, Mol Cellular & Dev Biol Interdept Grad Program, Ames, IA 50011 USA.",ewyu@iastate.edu,"Long, Feng/F-5475-2011; Jernigan, Robert/A-5421-2012","Long, Feng/0000-0001-6313-8558; Zimmermann, Michael/0000-0001-7073-0525","National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Center for Research Resources [RR-15301]; US Department of Energy, Office of Basic Energy Sciences [DE-AC02-06CH11357]; NIH [GM074027, GM086431, GM081680, GM072014]","We thank M.

Through different mechanisms and kinetics, these two reprogramming methods reset genomic methylation, an epigenetic modification of DNA that influences gene expression, leading us to hypothesize that the resulting pluripotent stem cells might have different properties. Here we observe that low-passage induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) derived by factor-based reprogramming of adult murine tissues harbour residual DNA methylation signatures characteristic of their somatic tissue of origin, which favours their differentiation along lineages related to the donor cell, while restricting alternative cell fates. Such an 'epigenetic memory' of the donor tissue could be reset by differentiation and serial reprogramming, or by treatment of iPSCs with chromatin-modifying drugs. In contrast, the differentiation and methylation of nuclear-transfer-derived pluripotent stem cells were more similar to classical embryonic stem cells than were iPSCs. Our data indicate that nuclear transfer more readily establishes the ground state of pluripotency than factor-based reprogramming, which can leave an epigenetic memory of the tissue of origin that may influence efforts at directed differentiation for applications in disease modelling or treatment.","[Doi, A.; Wen, B.; Ji, H.; Irizarry, R.

The biophysical properties of mitochondrial calcium uptake have been studied in detail, but the underlying proteins remain elusive. Here we use an integrative strategy to predict human genes involved in mitochondrial calcium entry based on clues from comparative physiology, evolutionary genomics and organelle proteomics. RNA interference against 13 top candidates highlighted one gene, CBARA1, that we call hereafter mitochondrial calcium uptake 1 (MICU1). Silencing MICU1 does not disrupt mitochondrial respiration or membrane potential but abolishes mitochondrial calcium entry in intact and permeabilized cells, and attenuates the metabolic coupling between cytosolic calcium transients and activation of matrix dehydrogenases. MICU1 is associated with the mitochondrial inner membrane and has two canonical EF hands that are essential for its activity, indicating a role in calcium sensing. MICU1 represents the founding member of a set of proteins required for high-capacity mitochondrial calcium uptake. Its discovery may lead to the complete molecular characterization of mitochondrial calcium uptake pathways, and offers genetic strategies for understanding their contribution to normal physiology and disease.","[Perocchi, Fabiana; Gohil, Vishal M.; Girgis, Hany S.; Bao, X.

The final challenge-that is, single-shot measurement of the electron spin-has proved to be the most difficult of the three and so far only time-averaged optical measurements have been reported(9-12). The main obstacle to optical spin readout in single quantum dots is that the same laser that probes the spin state also flips the spin being measured. Here, by using a gate-controlled quantum dot molecule(13-15), we present the ability to measure the spin state of a single electron in real time via the intermittency of quantum dot resonance fluorescence(12,16).

With its high carrier mobility, graphene is of particular interest for ultrahigh-speed radio-frequency electronics(12-18). However, conventional device fabrication processes cannot readily be applied to produce high-speed graphene transistors because they often introduce significant defects into the monolayer of carbon lattices and severely degrade the device performance(19-21). Here we report an approach to the fabrication of high-speed graphene transistors with a self-aligned nanowire gate to prevent such degradation. A Co(2)Si-Al(2)O(3) core-shell nanowire is used as the gate, with the source and drain electrodes defined through a self-alignment process and the channel length defined by the nanowire diameter. The physical assembly of the nanowire gate preserves the high carrier mobility in graphene, and the self-alignment process ensures that the edges of the source, drain and gate electrodes are automatically and precisely positioned so that no overlapping or significant gaps exist between these electrodes, thus minimizing access resistance. It therefore allows for transistor performance not previously possible. Graphene transistors with a channel length as low as 140 nm have been fabricated with the highest scaled on-current (3.32 mA mu m(-1)) and transconductance (1.27 mS mu m(-1)) reported so far. Significantly, on-chip microwave measurements demonstrate that the self-aligned devices have a high intrinsic cut-off (transit) frequency of f(T) = 100-300 GHz, with the extrinsic f(T) (in the range of a few gigahertz) largely limited by parasitic pad capacitance. The reported intrinsic f(T) of the graphene transistors is comparable to that of the very best high-electron-mobility transistors with similar gate lengths(10).","[Liao, Lei; Qu, Yongquan; Duan, Xiangfeng] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Chem & Biochem, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Lin, Yung-Chen; Cheng, Rui; Bai, Jingwei; Liu, Yuan; Huang, Yu] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Bao, Mingqiang; Wang, Kang L.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Elect Engn, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Wang, Kang L.; Huang, Yu] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Calif Nanosyst Inst, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA","Duan, XF (reprint author), Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Chem & Biochem, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.",xduan@chem.ucla.edu,"Qu, Yongquan/A-7203-2011; Bai, Jingwei/G-4245-2012; Lin, Yung-Chen/G-7333-2012; liao, lei/O-4052-2014; Liu, Yuan/G-4834-2016",,NSF [0956171]; NIH [1DP2OD004342-01],"We thank A.

Accompanied by strong winds and heavy precipitation, these often explosively developing mesoscale cyclones-termed polar lows(1)-constitute a threat to offshore activities such as shipping or oil and gas exploitation. Yet owing to their small scale, polar lows are poorly represented in the observational and global reanalysis data(2) often used for climatological investigations of atmospheric features and cannot be assessed in coarse-resolution global simulations of possible future climates. Here we show that in a future anthropogenically warmed climate, the frequency of polar lows is projected to decline. We used a series of regional climate model simulations to downscale a set of global climate change scenarios(3) from the Intergovernmental Panel of Climate Change. In this process, we first simulated the formation of polar low systems in the North Atlantic and then counted the individual cases. A previous study(4) using NCEP/NCAR re-analysis data(5) revealed that polar low frequency from 1948 to 2005 did not systematically change. Now, in projections for the end of the twenty-first century, we found a significantly lower number of polar lows and a northward shift of their mean genesis region in response to elevated atmospheric greenhouse gas concentration. This change can be related to changes in the North Atlantic sea surface temperature and mid-troposphere temperature; the latter is found to rise faster than the former so that the resulting stability is increased, hindering the formation or intensification of polar lows. Our results provide a rare example of a climate change effect in which a type of extreme weather is likely to decrease, rather than increase.","[Zahn, Matthias] Univ Reading, Environm Syst Sci Ctr, Reading RG6 6AL, Berks, England; [Zahn, Matthias; von Storch, Hans] GKSS Forschungszentrum Geesthacht GmbH, Inst Coastal Res Syst Anal & Modelling, D-21502 Geesthacht, Germany; [von Storch, Hans] Univ Hamburg, Inst Meteorol, D-20146 Hamburg, Germany","Zahn, M (reprint author), Univ Reading, Environm Syst Sci Ctr, 3 Earley Gate, Reading RG6 6AL, Berks, England.",matthias.zahn@gkss.de,"von Storch, Hans/J-4165-2012","von Storch, Hans/0000-0002-5825-8069",DFG [512]; International Detection and Attribution Group (IDAG); DoE,"We thank the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology in Germany for providing access to their ECHAM5/MPI-OM climate change simulations.

The strongest response is predicted in orogens dominated by highly efficient alpine glacial erosion, producing a characteristic pattern of enhanced erosion on the windward flank of the orogen and maximum elevation controlled by glacier equilibriumline altitude(3,4), where long-term glacier mass gain equals mass loss. However, acquiring definitive field evidence of an active tectonic response to global climate cooling has been elusive(5). Here we present an extensive new low-temperature thermochronologic data set from the Patagonian Andes, a high-latitude active orogen with a well-documented late Cenozoic tectonic, climatic and glacial history. Data from 38 degrees S to 49 degrees S record a marked acceleration in erosion 7 to 5 Myr ago coeval with the onset of major Patagonian glaciation(6) and retreat of deformation from the easternmost thrust front(7). The highest rates and magnitudes of erosion are restricted to the glacial equilibrium line altitude on the windward western flank of the orogen, as predicted in models of glaciated critical taper orogens where erosion rate is a function of ice sliding velocity(3,8). In contrast, towards higher latitudes (49 degrees S to 56 degrees S) a transition to older bedrock cooling ages signifies much reduced late Cenozoic erosion despite dominantly glacial conditions here since the latest Miocene(6). The increased height of the orogenic divide at these latitudes (well above the equilibrium line altitude) leads us to conclude that the southernmost Patagonian Andes represent the first recognized example of regional glacial protection of an active orogen from erosion, leading to constructive growth in orogen height and width.","[Thomson, Stuart N.; Reiners, Peter W.] Univ Arizona, Dept Geosci, Tucson, AZ 85271 USA; [Thomson, Stuart N.; Brandon, Mark T.; Wilson, Nathaniel J.] Yale Univ, Dept Geol & Geophys, New Haven, CT 06511 USA; [Vasquez, Cristian] Univ Chile, Dept Geol, Santiago, Chile; [Tomkin, Jonathan H.] Univ Illinois, Dept Geol, Urbana, IL 61801 USA","Thomson, SN (reprint author), Univ Arizona, Dept Geosci, Tucson, AZ 85271 USA.",thomson@email.arizona.edu,"Thomson, Stuart/A-1222-2009","Thomson, Stuart/0000-0003-4331-5654; Wilson, Nat/0000-0002-0642-0853","NSF [EAR0447140]; Chilean Fondecyt awards [1010412, 1050431, 7010412, 7060240]","This work was supported by the NSF Geomorphology and Land Use Dynamics and Tectonics Award EAR0447140.

Gene therapy of beta-thalassaemia is particularly challenging given the requirement for massive haemoglobin production in a lineage-specific manner and the lack of selective advantage for corrected haematopoietic stem cells. Compound beta(E)/beta(0)-thalassaemia is the most common form of severe thalassaemia in southeast Asian countries and their diasporas(1,2). The beta(E)-globin allele bears a point mutation that causes alternative splicing. The abnormally spliced form is non-coding, whereas the correctly spliced messenger RNA expresses a mutated beta(E)-globin with partial instability(1,2). When this is compounded with a non-functional beta(0) allele, a profound decrease in beta-globin synthesis results, and approximately half of beta(E)/beta(0)-thalassaemia patients are transfusion-dependent(1,2). The only available curative therapy is allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation, although most patients do not have a human-leukocyte-antigen-matched, geno-identical donor, and those who do still risk rejection or graft-versus-host disease. Here we show that, 33 months after lentiviral beta-globin gene transfer, an adult patient with severe beta(E)/beta(0)-thalassaemia dependent on monthly transfusions since early childhood has become transfusion independent for the past 21 months. Blood haemoglobin is maintained between 9 and 10 g dl(-1), of which one-third contains vector-encoded beta-globin. Most of the therapeutic benefit results from a dominant, myeloid-biased cell clone, in which the integrated vector causes transcriptional activation of HMGA2 in erythroid cells with further increased expression of a truncated HMGA2 mRNA insensitive to degradation by let-7 microRNAs. The clonal dominance that accompanies therapeutic efficacy may be coincidental and stochastic or result froma hitherto benign cell expansion caused by dysregulation of the HMGA2 gene in stem/progenitor cells.","[Payen, Emmanuel; Negre, Olivier; Fusil, Floriane; Maouche-Chretien, Leila; Chretien, Stany; Beuzard, Yves; Leboulch, Philippe] CEA, Inst Emerging Dis & Innovat Therapies iMETI, F-92265 Fontenay Aux Roses, France; [Cavazzana-Calvo, Marina; Caccavelli, Laure; Hacein-Bey-Abina, Salima] Grp Hosp Univ Ouest, AP HP, INSERM, Clin Invest Ctr Biotherapy, F-75015 Paris, France; [Cavazzana-Calvo, Marina; Caccavelli, Laure; Fischer, Alain; Hacein-Bey-Abina, Salima] Univ Paris 05, F-75005 Paris, France; [Payen, Emmanuel; Negre, Olivier; Fusil, Floriane; Maouche-Chretien, Leila; Chretien, Stany; Beuzard, Yves; Leboulch, Philippe] Univ Paris 11, CEA, iMETI, F-92265 Fontenay Aux Roses, France; [Payen, Emmanuel; Negre, Olivier; Fusil, Floriane; Maouche-Chretien, Leila; Chretien, Stany; Beuzard, Yves; Leboulch, Philippe] INSERM, U962, F-92265 Fontenay Aux Roses, France; [Payen, Emmanuel; Negre, Olivier; Fusil, Floriane; Soulier, Jean; Larghero, Jerome; Kabbara, Nabil; Dalle, Bruno; Gourmel, Bernard; Socie, Gerard; Beuzard, Yves; Gluckman, Eliane] Univ Paris 07, Hop St Louis, Inst Hematol,AP HP, Dept Hematol Bone Marrow Transplantat & Biochem, F-75010 Paris, France; [Negre, Olivier; Gillet-Legrand, Beatrix] CEA, iMETI, F-92265 Fontenay Aux Roses, France; [Wang, Gary; Brady, Troy; Bushman, Frederick] Univ Penn, Sch Med, Dept Microbiol, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Hehir, Kathleen; Down, Julian; Denaro, Maria; Westerman, Karen; Dorazio, Ronald; Mulder, Geert-Jan; Polack, Axel] Genetix Pharmaceut, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Westerman, Karen; Cavallesco, Resy; Chretien, Stany; Leboulch, Philippe] Brigham & Womens Hosp, Div Genet, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Westerman, Karen; Cavallesco, Resy; Chretien, Stany; Leboulch, Philippe] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Sgarra, Riccardo] Univ Trieste, Dept Life Sci, I-34127 Trieste, Italy; [Bernaudin, Francoise] Ctr Hosp Intercommunal Creteil, F-94000 Creteil, France; [Girot, Robert] Hop Tenon, Dept Biol, F-75020 Paris, France; [Bank, Arthur] Columbia Univ Coll Phys & Surg, Dept Genet & Dev, New York, NY 10032 USA; [Bank, Arthur] Columbia Univ Coll Phys & Surg, Dept Med, New York, NY 10032 USA; [Cartier, Nathalie; Aubourg, Patrick] Univ Paris 05, INSERM, UMR745, F-75005 Paris, France; [Cornetta, Kenneth] Indiana Univ, Dept Med & Mol Genet, Indianapolis, IN 46202 USA; [Galacteros, Frederic] Hop Henri Mondor, AP HP, F-94000 Creteil, France","Leboulch, P (reprint author), CEA, Inst Emerging Dis & Innovat Therapies iMETI, F-92265 Fontenay Aux Roses, France.",pleboulch@rics.bwh.harvard.edu,"maouche, leila/E-3887-2017; cartier, nathalie/C-3103-2012","cartier, nathalie/0000-0003-2298-5261; Sgarra, Riccardo/0000-0002-4496-2856","NIH [HL090921, AI52845, AI082020]; L'Association francaise contre les myopathies","We thank S.

In the adult brain, niches that maintain a source of neural stem cells (NSCs) and neural progenitor cells (NPCs) are the subventricular zone (SVZ) of the lateral ventricle and the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus(3-5). The size of the NSC population of the SVZ at any time is the result of several ongoing processes, including self-renewal, cell differentiation, and cell death. Maintaining the balance between NSCs and NPCs in the SVZ niche is critical to supply the brain with specific neural populations, both under normal conditions or after injury. A fundamental question relevant to both normal development and to cell-based repair strategies in the central nervous system is how the balance of different NSC and NPC populations is maintained in the niche. EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor) and Notch signalling pathways have fundamental roles during development of multicellular organisms(6). In Drosophila and in Caenorhabditis elegans these pathways may have either cooperative or antagonistic functions(7-9). In the SVZ, Notch regulates NSC identity and self-renewal, whereas EGFR specifically affects NPC proliferation and migration(10-13). This suggests that interplay of these two pathways may maintain the balance between NSC and NPC numbers. Here we show that functional cell-cell interaction between NPCs and NSCs through EGFR and Notch signalling has a crucial role in maintaining the balance between these cell populations in the SVZ. Enhanced EGFR signalling in vivo results in the expansion of the NPC pool, and reduces NSC number and self-renewal. This occurs through a non-cell-autonomous mechanism involving EGFR-mediated regulation of Notch signalling. Our findings define a novel interaction between EGFR and Notch pathways in the adult SVZ, and thus provide a mechanism for NSC and NPC pool maintenance.","[Aguirre, Adan; Gallo, Vittorio] Childrens Natl Med Ctr, Neurosci Res Ctr, Washington, DC 20010 USA; [Rubio, Maria E.] Univ Pittsburgh, Sch Med, Dept Otolaryngol, Pittsburgh, PA 15261 USA","Gallo, V (reprint author), Childrens Natl Med Ctr, Neurosci Res Ctr, Washington, DC 20010 USA.",vgallo@cnmcresearch.org,,,"NIH [R01NS045702, R01NS056427, K99NS057944, ROO NS057944-03, R01DC006881]; NIH IDDRC [P30HD40677]; NSF [DBI-0420580]","We thank N.

However, purging of immature and mature self-reactive T and B cells is incomplete and may also require the involvement of cells programmed to suppress immune responses(1).

Here we delineate a CD8(+) regulatory T-cell lineage that is essential for the maintenance of self tolerance and prevention of murine autoimmune disease. Genetic disruption of the inhibitory interaction between these CD8(+) T cells and their target Qa-1(+) follicular T-helper cells results in the development of a lethal systemic-lupus-erythematosus-like autoimmune disease.

Failure to promptly clear apoptotic cells has been linked to many diseases(1-3). ELMO1 is an evolutionarily conserved cytoplasmic engulfment protein that functions downstream of the phosphatidylserine receptor BAI1, and, along with DOCK1 and the GTPase RAC1, promotes internalization of the dying cells(4-7). Here we report the generation of ELMO1-deficient mice, which we found to be unexpectedly viable and grossly normal. However, they had a striking testicular pathology, with disrupted seminiferous epithelium, multinucleated giant cells, uncleared apoptotic germ cells and decreased sperm output. Subsequent in vitro and in vivo analyses revealed a crucial role for ELMO1 in the phagocytic clearance of apoptotic germ cells by Sertoli cells lining the seminiferous epithelium. The engulfment receptor BAI1 and RAC1 (upstream and downstream of ELMO1, respectively) were also important for Sertoli-cell-mediated engulfment. Collectively, these findings uncover a selective requirement for ELMO1 in Sertoli-cell-mediated removal of apoptotic germ cells and make a compelling case for a relationship between engulfment and tissue homeostasis in vivo.","[Elliott, Michael R.; Park, Daeho; Juncadella, Ignacio J.; Ravichandran, Kodi S.] Univ Virginia, Beirne B Carter Ctr Immunol Res, Charlottesville, VA 22908 USA; [Elliott, Michael R.; Park, Daeho; Juncadella, Ignacio J.; Kinchen, Jason M.; Lysiak, Jeffrey J.; Ravichandran, Kodi S.] Univ Virginia, Ctr Cell Clearance, Charlottesville, VA 22908 USA; [Zheng, Shuqiu; Woodson, Robin I.; Reardon, Michael A.; Zhang, Jun; Lysiak, Jeffrey J.] Univ Virginia, Dept Urol, Charlottesville, VA 22908 USA; [Kinchen, Jason M.; Ravichandran, Kodi S.] Univ Virginia, Dept Microbiol, Charlottesville, VA 22908 USA","Ravichandran, KS (reprint author), Univ Virginia, Beirne B Carter Ctr Immunol Res, Charlottesville, VA 22908 USA.",jl6n@virginia.edu; ravi@virginia.edu,,"Elliott, Michael/0000-0002-0642-482X",National Institutes of Health; American Cancer Society,"We thank T.

Haematopoiesis provides a well-defined model to study epigenetic modifications during cell-fate decisions, as multipotent progenitors (MPPs) differentiate into progressively restricted myeloid or lymphoid progenitors. Although DNA methylation is critical for myeloid versus lymphoid differentiation, as demonstrated by the myeloerythroid bias in Dnmt1 hypomorphs(1), a comprehensive DNA methylation map of haematopoietic progenitors, or of any multipotent/oligopotent lineage, does not exist. Here we examined 4.6 million CpG sites throughout the genome for MPPs, common lymphoid progenitors (CLPs), common myeloid progenitors (CMPs), granulocyte/macrophage progenitors (GMPs), and thymocyte progenitors (DN1, DN2, DN3). Marked epigenetic plasticity accompanied both lymphoid and myeloid restriction. Myeloid commitment involved less global DNA methylation than lymphoid commitment, supported functionally by myeloid skewing of progenitors following treatment with a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor. Differential DNA methylation correlated with gene expression more strongly at CpG island shores than CpG islands. Many examples of genes and pathways not previously known to be involved in choice between lymphoid/myeloid differentiation have been identified, such as Arl4c and Jdp2. Several transcription factors, including Meis1, were methylated and silenced during differentiation, indicating a role in maintaining an undifferentiated state. Additionally, epigenetic modification of modifiers of the epigenome seems to be important in haematopoietic differentiation. Our results directly demonstrate that modulation of DNA methylation occurs during lineage-specific differentiation and defines a comprehensive map of the methylation and transcriptional changes that accompany myeloid versus lymphoid fate decisions.","[Ji, Hong; Murakami, Peter; Doi, Akiko; Lee, Hwajin; Irizarry, Rafael A.; Feinberg, Andrew P.] Johns Hopkins Univ, Sch Med, Ctr Epigenet, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA; [Ji, Hong; Murakami, Peter; Doi, Akiko; Lee, Hwajin; Irizarry, Rafael A.; Feinberg, Andrew P.] Johns Hopkins Univ, Sch Med, Dept Med, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA; [Ehrlich, Lauren I.

Checkpoint loss results in genomic instability and contributes to the evolution of cancer. Among G1-, S-, G2- and M-phase checkpoints, genetic studies indicate the role of an intact S-phase checkpoint in maintaining genome integrity(3,4). Although the basic framework of the S-phase checkpoint in multicellular organisms has been outlined, the mechanistic details remain to be elucidated. Human chromosome-11 band-q23 translocations disrupting the MLL gene lead to poor prognostic leukaemias(5-9). Here we assign MLL as a novel effector in the mammalian S-phase checkpoint network and identify checkpoint dysfunction as an underlying mechanism of MLL leukaemias. MLL is phosphorylated at serine 516 by ATR in response to genotoxic stress in the S phase, which disrupts its interaction with, and hence its degradation by, the SCF(Skp2) E3 ligase, leading to its accumulation. Stabilized MLL protein accumulates on chromatin, methylates histone H3 lysine 4 at late replication origins and inhibits the loading of CDC45 to delay DNA replication. Cells deficient in MLL showed radioresistant DNA synthesis and chromatid-type genomic abnormalities, indicative of S-phase checkpoint dysfunction. Reconstitution of Mll(-/-) (Mll also known as Mll1) mouse embryonic fibroblasts with wild-type but not S516A or Delta SET mutant MLL rescues the S-phase checkpoint defects. Moreover, murine myeloid progenitor cells carrying an Mll-CBP knock-in allele that mimics human t(11;16) leukaemia show a severe radioresistant DNA synthesis phenotype. MLL fusions function as dominant negative mutants that abrogate the ATR-mediated phosphorylation/stabilization of wild-type MLL on damage to DNA, and thus compromise the S-phase checkpoint. Together, our results identify MLL as a key constituent of the mammalian DNA damage response pathway and show that deregulation of the S-phase checkpoint incurred by MLL translocations probably contributes to the pathogenesis of human MLL leukaemias.","[Liu, Han; Takeda, Shugaku; Westergard, Todd D.; Cheng, Emily H. -Y.; Hsieh, James J. -D.] Washington Univ, Sch Med, Dept Med, St Louis, MO 63110 USA; [Kumar, Rakesh; Pandita, Tej K.] Univ Texas SW Med Ctr Dallas, Dept Radiat Oncol, Dallas, TX 75390 USA; [Brown, Eric J.] Univ Penn, Sch Med, Dept Canc Biol, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA","Hsieh, JJD (reprint author), Washington Univ, Sch Med, Dept Med, St Louis, MO 63110 USA.",jhsieh@dom.wustl.edu,,,"American Society of Hematology [CA119008, CA129537/CA123232]","We thank J.

Divergence from H3 raises the possibility that CENP-A generates unique chromatin features to mark physically centromere location. Here we report the crystal structure of a subnucleosomal heterotetramer, human (CENP-A-H4)(2), that reveals three distinguishing properties encoded by the residues that comprise the CENP-A targeting domain (CATD; ref. 2): (1) a CENP-A-CENP-A interface that is substantially rotated relative to the H3-H3 interface; (2) a protruding loop L1 of the opposite charge as that on H3; and (3) strong hydrophobic contacts that rigidify the CENP-A-H4 interface. Residues involved in the CENP-A-CENP-A rotation are required for efficient incorporation into centromeric chromatin, indicating specificity for an unconventional nucleosome shape. DNA topological analysis indicates that CENP-A-containing nucleosomes are octameric with conventional left-handed DNA wrapping, in contrast to other recent proposals(3-6). Our results indicate that CENP-A marks centromere location by restructuring the nucleosome from within its folded histone core.","[Sekulic, Nikolina; Bassett, Emily A.; Rogers, Danielle J.; Black, Ben E.] Univ Penn, Sch Med, Dept Biochem & Biophys, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Bassett, Emily A.; Black, Ben E.] Univ Penn, Sch Med, Grad Grp Biochem & Mol Biophys, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA","Black, BE (reprint author), Univ Penn, Sch Med, Dept Biochem & Biophys, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",blackbe@mail.med.upenn.edu,"Sekulic, Nikolina /F-8911-2013; ID, BioCAT/D-2459-2012; Sekulic, Nikolina /N-5550-2016","Sekulic, Nikolina /0000-0001-7555-3222","NIH [GM82989, GM08275]; Burroughs Wellcome Fund; Rita Allen Foundation; American Cancer Society; American Heart Association","We thank D.

Recently, experimental evidence for growth on formate was reported for syntrophic communities of Moorella sp. strain AMP and a hydrogen-consuming Methanothermobacter species and of Desulfovibrio sp. strain G11 and Methanobrevibacter arboriphilus strain AZ(1). The basis of the sustainable growth of the formate-users is explained by H-2 consumption by the methanogens, which lowers the H-2 partial pressure, thus making the pathway exergonic(2). However, it has not been shown that a single strain can grow on formate by catalysing its conversion to bicarbonate and H-2. Here we report that several hyperthermophilic archaea belonging to the Thermococcus genus are capable of formate-oxidizing, H-2-producing growth. The actual Delta G values for the formate metabolism are calculated to range between -8 and -20 kJ mol(-1) under the physiological conditions where Thermococcus onnurineus strain NA1 are grown. Furthermore, we detected ATP synthesis in the presence of formate as a sole energy source. Gene expression profiling and disruption identified the gene cluster encoding formate hydrogen lyase, cation/proton antiporter and formate transporter, which were responsible for the growth of T. onnurineus NA1 on formate. This work shows formate-driven growth by a single microorganism with protons as the electron acceptor, and reports the biochemical basis of this ability.","[Kim, Yun Jae; Lee, Hyun Sook; Kim, Eun Sook; Bae, Seung Seob; Lim, Jae Kyu; Cha, Sun-Shin; Kim, Sang-Jin; Kwon, Kae Kyoung; Lee, Jung-Hyun; Kang, Sung Gyun] Korea Ocean Res & Dev Inst, Ansan 425600, South Korea; [Lee, Hyun Sook; Bae, Seung Seob; Lim, Jae Kyu; Cha, Sun-Shin; Kim, Sang-Jin; Kwon, Kae Kyoung; Lee, Jung-Hyun; Kang, Sung Gyun] Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Marine Biotechnol, Taejon 305333, South Korea; [Matsumi, Rie; Imanaka, Tadayuki; Atomi, Haruyuki] Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Engn, Dept Synthet Chem & Biol Chem, Nishikyo Ku, Kyoto 6158510, Japan; [Lebedinsky, Alexander V.; Sokolova, Tatyana G.; Kozhevnikova, Darya A.; Bonch-Osmolovskaya, Elizaveta A.] Russian Acad Sci, Winogradsky Inst Microbiol, Moscow 117312, Russia","Lee, JH (reprint author), Korea Ocean Res & Dev Inst, POB 29, Ansan 425600, South Korea.",jlee@kordi.re.kr; sgkang@kordi.re.kr,"Kozhevnikova, Daria/E-2536-2014","Kozhevnikova, Daria/0000-0002-7263-3611","KORDI [PE98513]; Marine and Extreme Genome Research Center; Ministry of Land, Transport, and Maritime Affairs, Korea; RAS; Russian Foundation of Basic Research [10-04-01180]","This work was supported by the KORDI in-house programme (PE98513), the Marine and Extreme Genome Research Center programme and the Development of Biohydrogen Production Technology using Hyperthermophilic Archaea programme of the Ministry of Land, Transport, and Maritime Affairs, Korea, as well as by the Molecular and Cell Biology programme of RAS and the Russian Foundation of Basic Research (grant no. 10-04-01180).

But at the molecular level, control loops always involve signalling steps with finite rates for random births and deaths of individual molecules. Here we show, by developing mathematical tools that merge control and information theory with physical chemistry, that seemingly mild constraints on these rates place severe limits on the ability to suppress molecular fluctuations. Specifically, the minimum standard deviation in abundances decreases with the quartic root of the number of signalling events, making it extremely expensive to increase accuracy. Our results are formulated in terms of experimental observables, and existing data show that cells use brute force when noise suppression is essential; for example, regulatory genes are transcribed tens of thousands of times per cell cycle. The theory challenges conventional beliefs about biochemical accuracy and presents an approach to the rigorous analysis of poorly characterized biological systems.","[Lestas, Ioannis; Vinnicombe, Glenn] Univ Cambridge, Dept Engn, Cambridge CB2 1PZ, England; [Paulsson, Johan] Harvard Univ, Dept Syst Biol, Boston, MA 02115 USA","Vinnicombe, G (reprint author), Univ Cambridge, Dept Engn, Cambridge CB2 1PZ, England.",gv@eng.cam.ac.uk; johan_paulsson@hms.harvard.edu,,,"BBSRC [BB/C008073/1]; National Science Foundation [DMS-074876-0, 0720056]; National Institutes of Health [GM081563-02, GM068763-06]","This research was supported by the BBSRC under grant BB/C008073/1, by the National Science Foundation grants DMS-074876-0 and CAREER 0720056, and by grants GM081563-02 and GM068763-06 from the National Institutes of Health.",,32,177,179,5,45,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,9-Sep,2010,467,7312,,,,,174,178,,10.1038/nature09333,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,647KB,WOS:000281616300027,20829788,No,,,11/20/17

A catalytically inactive variant of USP14 has reduced inhibitory activity, indicating that inhibition is mediated by trimming of the ubiquitin chain on the substrate. A high-throughput screen identified a selective small-molecule inhibitor of the deubiquitinating activity of human USP14. Treatment of cultured cells with this compound enhanced degradation of several proteasome substrates that have been implicated in neurodegenerative disease. USP14 inhibition accelerated the degradation of oxidized proteins and enhanced resistance to oxidative stress.

Like massless relativistic particles, they have linear dispersion and chiral eigenstates. Furthermore, two sets of electrons centred at different points in reciprocal space ('valleys') have this dispersion, giving rise to valley degeneracy. The symmetry between valleys, together with spin symmetry, leads to a fourfold quartet degeneracy of the Landau levels, observed as peaks in the density of states produced by an applied magnetic field. Recent electron transport measurements have observed the lifting of the fourfold degeneracy in very large applied magnetic fields, separating the quartet into integer(1-4) and, more recently, fractional(5,6) levels. The exact nature of the broken-symmetry states that form within the Landau levels and lift these degeneracies is unclear at present and is a topic of intense theoretical debate(7-11). Here we study the detailed features of the four quantum states that make up a degenerate graphene Landau level. We use high-resolution scanning tunnelling spectroscopy at temperatures as low as 10 mK in an applied magnetic field to study the top layer of multilayer epitaxial graphene. When the Fermi level lies inside the fourfold Landau manifold, significant electron correlation effects result in an enhanced valley splitting for even filling factors, and an enhanced electron spin splitting for odd filling factors. Most unexpectedly, we observe states with Landau level filling factors of 7/2, 9/2 and 11/2, suggestive of new many-body states in graphene.","[Song, Young Jae; Otte, Alexander F.; Min, Hongki; Adam, Shaffique; Stiles, Mark D.; Stroscio, Joseph A.] NIST, Ctr Nanoscale Sci & Technol, Gaithersburg, MD 20899 USA; [Song, Young Jae; Otte, Alexander F.; Min, Hongki] Univ Maryland, Maryland NanoCtr, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Kuk, Young] Seoul Natl Univ, Dept Phys & Astron, Seoul 1517474, South Korea; [Hu, Yike; Torrance, David B.; First, Phillip N.; de Heer, Walt A.] Georgia Inst Technol, Sch Phys, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA; [MacDonald, Allan H.] Univ Texas Austin, Dept Phys, Austin, TX 78712 USA","Stroscio, JA (reprint author), NIST, Ctr Nanoscale Sci & Technol, Gaithersburg, MD 20899 USA.",joseph.stroscio@nist.gov,"Adam, Shaffique/B-3264-2008; Stiles, Mark/K-2426-2012; Otte, Sander/A-4838-2013; Song, Young Jae/A-5422-2013; Min, Hongki/C-3429-2009","Adam, Shaffique/0000-0002-3095-9920; Stiles, Mark/0000-0001-8238-4156; Otte, Sander/0000-0003-0781-8537; Song, Young Jae/0000-0001-6172-3817; Min, Hongki/0000-0001-5043-2432; MacDonald, Allan/0000-0003-3561-3379","Korean Government (MOEHRD) [KRF- 2006-214-C00022]; NSF [DMR-0820382 [MRSEC], DMR-0804908, DMR-0606489]; Welch Foundation; Semiconductor Research Corporation","We thank N.

The atomic thinness, stability and electrical sensitivity of graphene motivated us to investigate the potential use of graphene membranes and graphene nanopores to characterize single molecules of DNA in ionic solution. Here we show that when immersed in an ionic solution, a layer of graphene becomes a new electrochemical structure that we call a transelectrode. The trans-electrode's unique properties are the consequence of the atomic-scale proximity of its two opposing liquid-solid interfaces together with graphene's well known inplane conductivity. We show that several trans-electrode properties are revealed by ionic conductance measurements on a graphene membrane that separates two aqueous ionic solutions. Although our membranes are only one to two atomic layers(2,3) thick, we find they are remarkable ionic insulators with a very small stable conductance that depends on the ion species in solution. Electrical measurements on graphene membranes in which a single nanopore has been drilled show that the membrane's effective insulating thickness is less than one nanometre. This small effective thickness makes graphene an ideal substrate for very high resolution, high throughput nanopore-based single-molecule detectors. The sensitivity of graphene's in-plane electronic conductivity to its immediate surface environment and trans-membrane solution potentials will offer new insights into atomic surface processes and sensor development opportunities.","[Garaj, S.; Golovchenko, J.

The presence of the Younger Dryas stadial (similar to 12.9 to similar to 11.7 kyr ago) is established throughout much of the Northern Hemisphere, but the global timing, nature and extent of the event are not well established. Evidence in mid to low latitudes of the Southern Hemisphere, in particular, has remained perplexing(1-6). The debate has in part focused on the behaviour of mountain glaciers in New Zealand, where previous research has found equivocal evidence for the precise timing of increased or reduced ice extent(1-3). The interhemispheric behaviour of the climate system during the Younger Dryas thus remains an open question, fundamentally limiting our ability to formulate realistic models of global climate dynamics for this time period. Here we show that New Zealand's glaciers retreated after similar to 13 kyr BP, at the onset of the Younger Dryas, and in general over the subsequent similar to 1.5-kyr period. Our evidence is based on detailed landform mapping, a high-precision Be-10 chronology(7) and reconstruction of former ice extents and snow lines from well-preserved cirque moraines. Our late-glacial glacier chronology matches climatic trends in Antarctica, Southern Ocean behaviour and variations in atmospheric CO2. The evidence points to a distinct warming of the southern mid-latitude atmosphere during the Younger Dryas and a close coupling between New Zealand's cryosphere and southern high-latitude climate. These findings support the hypothesis that extensive winter sea ice and curtailed meridional ocean overturning in the North Atlantic led to a strong interhemispheric thermal gradient(8) during late-glacial times, in turn leading to increased upwelling and CO2 release from the Southern Ocean(9), thereby triggering Southern Hemisphere warming during the northern Younger Dryas.","[Kaplan, Michael R.; Schaefer, Joerg M.; Schwartz, Roseanne] Lamont Doherty Earth Observ, Palisades, NY 10964 USA; [Schaefer, Joerg M.] Columbia Univ, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Denton, George H.; Putnam, Aaron E.] Univ Maine, Dept Earth Sci, Orono, ME 04469 USA; [Denton, George H.; Putnam, Aaron E.] Univ Maine, Climate Change Inst, Orono, ME 04469 USA; [Barrell, David J.

It is the largest earthquake to rupture a mature seismic gap in a subduction zone that has been monitored with a dense space-geodetic network before the event. This provides an image of the pre-seismically locked state of the plate interface of unprecedentedly high resolution, allowing for an assessment of the spatial correlation of interseismic locking with coseismic slip. Pre-seismic locking might be used to anticipate future ruptures in many seismic gaps(6-12), given the fundamental assumption that locking and slip are similar. This hypothesis, however, could not be tested without the occurrence of the first gap-filling earthquake. Here we show evidence that the 2010 Maule earthquake slip distribution correlates closely with the patchwork of interseismic locking distribution as derived by inversion of global positioning system (GPS) observations during the previous decade. The earthquake nucleated in a region of high locking gradient and released most of the stresses accumulated in the area since the last major event in 1835. Two regions of high seismic slip (asperities) appeared to be nearly fully locked before the earthquake. Between these asperities, the rupture bridged a zone that was creeping interseismically with consistently low coseismic slip. The rupture stopped in areas that were highly locked before the earthquake but where pre-stress had been significantly reduced by overlapping twentieth-century earthquakes. Our work suggests that coseismic slip heterogeneity at the scale of single asperities should indicate the seismic potential of future great earthquakes, which thus might be anticipated by geodetic observations.","[Moreno, Marcos; Rosenau, Matthias; Oncken, Onno] GFZ German Res Ctr Geosci, Helmholtz Ctr Potsdam, D-14473 Potsdam, Germany","Oncken, O (reprint author), GFZ German Res Ctr Geosci, Helmholtz Ctr Potsdam, D-14473 Potsdam, Germany.",oncken@gfz-potsdam.de,"GEOFON, GlobalSeismicNetwork/E-4273-2012; Moreno, Marcos/M-4632-2013; Rosenau, Matthias/I-2081-2016","Moreno, Marcos/0000-0002-6023-7283; Rosenau, Matthias/0000-0003-1134-5381",,,,55,181,185,2,64,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,9-Sep,2010,467,7312,,,,,198,U84,,10.1038/nature09349,,7,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,647KB,WOS:000281616300032,20829792,No,Y,N,11/20/17

Until recently, carcharodontosaurs were restricted to a group of large theropods inhabiting the Late Cretaceous Gondwanan land masses(1,2), but in the last few years Laurasian evidence(3-5) has been causing a reevaluation of their initial diversification(6). Here we describe an almost complete and exquisitely preserved skeleton of a medium-sized (roughly six metres long) theropod from the Lower Cretaceous series (Barremian stage) Konservat-Lagerstatte of Las Hoyas(7) in Cuenca, Spain. Cladistic analysis supports the idea that the new taxon Concavenator corcovatus is a primitive member of Carcharodontosauria(6), exhibiting two unusual features: elongation of the neurapophyses of two presacral vertebrae forming a pointed, hump-like structure and a series of small bumps on the ulna. We think that these bumps are homologous to quill knobs present on some modern birds; the knobs are related to the insertion area of follicular ligaments that anchor the roots of the flight feathers (remiges) to the arm. We propose that Concavenator has integumentary follicular structures inserted on the ulna, as in modern birds. Because scales do not have follicles, we consider the structures anchored to the Concavenator arms to be non-scale skin appendages homologous to the feathers of modern birds. If this is true, then the phylogenetic bracket for the presence of non-scale skin structures homologous to feathers in theropod dinosaurs would be extended to the Neotetanurae, enlarging the scope for explaining the origin of feathers in theropods.","[Ortega, Francisco; Escaso, Fernando] Univ Nacl Educ Distancia, Fac Ciencias, Dept Fis Matemat & Fluidos, Grp Biol, E-28040 Madrid, Spain; [Escaso, Fernando; Sanz, Jose L.] Univ Autonoma Madrid, Fac Ciencias, Dept Biol, Unidad Paleontol, E-28049 Madrid, Spain","Ortega, F (reprint author), Univ Nacl Educ Distancia, Fac Ciencias, Dept Fis Matemat & Fluidos, Grp Biol, Paseo Senda del Rey 9, E-28040 Madrid, Spain.",fortega@ccia.uned.es,"Ortega, Francisco/B-5760-2009; Sanz, Jose Luis/L-2476-2013; Escaso, Fernando/H-9782-2015","Ortega, Francisco/0000-0002-7431-354X; Sanz, Jose Luis/0000-0002-5214-5725; Escaso, Fernando/0000-0001-7642-1555",Museo de las Ciencias de Castilla-La Mancha; Spanish Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovacion [CGL2005-05614],"We thank S.

An understanding of the molecular mechanisms guiding these intricate processes is in its infancy, substantially driven by the discovery of rare mutations that cause malformations of cortical development(3-6). Mapping of disease loci in putative Mendelian forms of malformations of cortical development has been hindered by marked locus heterogeneity, small kindred sizes and diagnostic classifications that may not reflect molecular pathogenesis. Here we demonstrate the use of whole-exome sequencing to overcome these obstacles by identifying recessive mutations in WD repeat domain 62 (WDR62) as the cause of a wide spectrum of severe cerebral cortical malformations including microcephaly, pachygyria with cortical thickening as well as hypoplasia of the corpus callosum. Some patients with mutations in WDR62 had evidence of additional abnormalities including lissencephaly, schizencephaly, polymicrogyria and, in one instance, cerebellar hypoplasia, all traits traditionally regarded as distinct entities. In mice and humans, WDR62 transcripts and protein are enriched in neural progenitors within the ventricular and subventricular zones. Expression of WDR62 in the neocortex is transient, spanning the period of embryonic neurogenesis. Unlike other known microcephaly genes, WDR62 does not apparently associate with centrosomes and is predominantly nuclear in localization. These findings unify previously disparate aspects of cerebral cortical development and highlight the use of whole-exome sequencing to identify disease loci in settings in which traditional methods have proved challenging.","[Bilguvar, Kaya; Ozturk, Ali Kemal; Louvi, Angeliki; Choi, Murim; Barak, Tanyeri; Bakircioglu, Mehmet; Yasuno, Katsuhito; Ho, Winson; Sanders, Stephan; Mane, Shrikant; Lifton, Richard P.; State, Matthew W.; Gunel, Murat] Yale Univ, Sch Med, Dept Genet, Ctr Human Genet & Genom, New Haven, CT 06510 USA; [Bilguvar, Kaya; Ozturk, Ali Kemal; Louvi, Angeliki; Choi, Murim; Barak, Tanyeri; Bakircioglu, Mehmet; Yasuno, Katsuhito; Ho, Winson; Sanders, Stephan; Mane, Shrikant; Lifton, Richard P.; State, Matthew W.; Gunel, Murat] Yale Univ, Sch Med, Program Neurogenet, New Haven, CT 06510 USA; [Bilguvar, Kaya; Ozturk, Ali Kemal; Louvi, Angeliki; Barak, Tanyeri; Bakircioglu, Mehmet; Yasuno, Katsuhito; Ho, Winson; Johnson, Michele H.; Bronen, Richard A.; Gunel, Murat] Yale Univ, Sch Med, Dept Neurosurg, New Haven, CT 06510 USA; [Bilguvar, Kaya; Ozturk, Ali Kemal; Louvi, Angeliki; Kwan, Kenneth Y.; Barak, Tanyeri; Bakircioglu, Mehmet; Yasuno, Katsuhito; Ho, Winson; Zhu, Ying; Sestan, Nenad; Gunel, Murat] Yale Univ, Sch Med, Dept Neurobiol, New Haven, CT 06510 USA; [Kwan, Kenneth Y.; Zhu, Ying; Sestan, Nenad] Yale Univ, Sch Med, Kavli Inst Neurosci, New Haven, CT 06510 USA; [Tatli, Burak; Ozmen, Meral] Istanbul Univ, Istanbul Fac Med, Dept Pediat, Div Neurol, TR-34093 Istanbul, Turkey; [Yalnizoglu, Dilek; Topcu, Meral] Hacettepe Univ, Sch Med, Dept Pediat, Div Neurol, TR-06100 Ankara, Turkey; [Tuysuz, Beyhan] Istanbul Univ, Cerrahpasa Fac Med, Dept Pediat, Div Genet, TR-34098 Istanbul, Turkey; [Caglayan, Ahmet Okay] Kayseri Educ & Res Hosp, Dept Med Genet, TR-38010 Kayseri, Turkey; [Gokben, Sarenur; Yilmaz, Sanem] Ege Univ, Fac Med, Dept Pediat, Div Neurol, TR-35100 Izmir, Turkey; [Kaymakcalan, Hande] Bahcesehir Univ, Fac Arts & Sci, TR-34353 Istanbul, Turkey; [Sanders, Stephan; State, Matthew W.] Yale Univ, Sch Med, Dept Psychiat, New Haven, CT 06510 USA; [Sanders, Stephan; State, Matthew W.] Yale Univ, Sch Med, Ctr Child Study, New Haven, CT 06510 USA; [Dincer, Alp] Acibadem Univ, Sch Med, Dept Radiol, TR-34742 Istanbul, Turkey; [Johnson, Michele H.; Bronen, Richard A.] Yale Univ, Sch Med, Dept Radiol, New Haven, CT 06510 USA; [Johnson, Michele H.] Yale Univ, Sch Med, Dept Otolaryngol, New Haven, CT 06510 USA; [Kocer, Naci] Istanbul Univ, Cerrahpasa Fac Med, Dept Radiol, TR-34098 Istanbul, Turkey; [Per, Hueseyin; Kumandas, Sefer] Erciyes Univ, Sch Med, Dept Pediat, Div Neurol, TR-38039 Kayseri, Turkey; [Mane, Shrikant] Yale Univ, Sch Med, Yale Ctr Genome Anal, New Haven, CT 06510 USA; [Pamir, Mehmet Necmettin] Acibadem Univ, Sch Med, Dept Neurosurg, TR-34742 Istanbul, Turkey; [Yalcinkaya, Cengiz] Istanbul Univ, Cerrahpasa Fac Med, Dept Neurol, Div Child Neurol, TR-34098 Istanbul, Turkey; [Lifton, Richard P.] Yale Univ, Sch Med, Howard Hughes Med Inst, New Haven, CT 06510 USA","Lifton, RP (reprint author), Yale Univ, Sch Med, Dept Genet, Ctr Human Genet & Genom, New Haven, CT 06510 USA.",richard.lifton@yale.edu; matthew.state@yale.edu; murat.gunel@yale.edu,"Kwan, Kenneth/F-8489-2011; Yasuno, Katsuhito/E-1960-2012; Dincer, Alp/D-3658-2015","Kwan, Kenneth/0000-0003-4711-071X; Yasuno, Katsuhito/0000-0002-3606-532X; Dincer, Alp/0000-0001-9158-8353; Yalcinkaya, Cengiz/0000-0002-3443-8524; Pamir, M Necmettin/0000-0002-5958-8625; Sanders, Stephan/0000-0001-9112-5148","Yale Program on Neurogenetics; Yale Center for Human Genetics and Genomics; National Institutes of Health [RC2 NS070477, UL1 RR024139NIH, UO1MH081896]; National Institutes of Health Neuroscience Microarray Consortium [U24 NS051869-02S1]","We are indebted to the patients and families who have contributed to this study.

We have recently established authentic rat ES cells(2,3). Here we report the generation of gene knockout rats using the ES-cell-based gene targeting technology. We designed a targeting vector to disrupt the tumour suppressor gene p53 (also known as Tp53) in rat ES cells by means of homologous recombination. p53 gene-targeted rat ES cells can be routinely generated. Furthermore, the p53 gene-targeted mutation in the rat ES-cell genome can transmit through the germ line via ES-cell rat chimaeras to create p53 gene knockout rats. The rat is the most widely used animal model in biological research(4-7). The establishment of gene targeting technology in rat ES cells, in combination with advances in genomics and the vast amount of research data on physiology and pharmacology in this species, now provide a powerful new platform for the study of human disease.","[Tong, Chang; Li, Ping; Ying, Qi-Long] Univ So Calif, Keck Sch Med, Dept Cell & Neurobiol, Eli & Edythe Broad Ctr Regenerat Med & Stem Cell, Los Angeles, CA 90033 USA; [Wu, Nancy L.; Yan, Youzhen] Univ So Calif, Keck Sch Med, Norris Canc Ctr Transgen, Knockout Core Facil, Los Angeles, CA 90033 USA","Ying, QL (reprint author), Univ So Calif, Keck Sch Med, Dept Cell & Neurobiol, Eli & Edythe Broad Ctr Regenerat Med & Stem Cell, Los Angeles, CA 90033 USA.",qying@usc.edu,,,NIH/NCRR [1R01 RR025881],"This work was supported by a NIH/NCRR grant to Q.-L.Y.

Whether there is cell-intrinsic recognition of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) by host innate pattern-recognition receptors and subsequent coupling to antiviral T-cell responses is not yet known(3). Dendritic cells are largely resistant to infection with HIV-1(4), but facilitate infection of co-cultured T-helper cells through a process of trans-enhancement(5,6). Here we show that, when dendritic cell resistance to infection is circumvented(7,8), HIV-1 induces dendritic cell maturation, an antiviral type I interferon response and activation of T cells. This innate response is dependent on the interaction of newly synthesized HIV-1 capsid with cellular cyclophilin A (CYPA) and the subsequent activation of the transcription factor IRF3. Because the peptidylprolyl isomerase CYPA also interacts with HIV-1 capsid to promote infectivity, our results indicate that capsid conformation has evolved under opposing selective pressures for infectivity versus furtiveness. Thus, a cell-intrinsic sensor for HIV-1 exists in dendritic cells and mediates an antiviral immune response, but it is not typically engaged owing to the absence of dendritic cell infection. The virulence of HIV-1 may be related to evasion of this response, the manipulation of which may be necessary to generate an effective HIV-1 vaccine.","[Manel, Nicolas; Hogstad, Brandon; Littman, Dan R.] NYU, Sch Med, Skirball Inst, Kimmel Ctr Biol & Med,Mol Pathogenesis Program, New York, NY 10016 USA; [Manel, Nicolas] Univ Montpellier 1 & 2, Inst Genet Mol Montpellier, CNRS, UMR5535, F-34070 Montpellier, France; [Hogstad, Brandon; Littman, Dan R.] NYU, Sch Med, Howard Hughes Med Inst, New York, NY 10016 USA; [Wang, Yaming; Levy, David E.; Unutmaz, Derya; Littman, Dan R.] NYU, Sch Med, Dept Pathol, New York, NY 10016 USA; [Wang, Yaming; Levy, David E.] NYU, Sch Med, Inst Canc, New York, NY 10016 USA; [Unutmaz, Derya; Littman, Dan R.] NYU, Sch Med, Dept Microbiol, New York, NY 10016 USA","Littman, DR (reprint author), NYU, Sch Med, Skirball Inst, Kimmel Ctr Biol & Med,Mol Pathogenesis Program, New York, NY 10016 USA.",dan.littman@med.nyu.edu,"Manel, Nicolas/E-2128-2011","Manel, Nicolas/0000-0002-1481-4430; Levy, David/0000-0002-7320-7788","EMBO; Cancer Research Institute; Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale; Howard Hughes Medical Institute; Helen and Martin Kimmel Center for Biology and Medicine; National Institutes of Health (NIH) [AI33856, AI28900, U54AI57168, R01AI065303]","We thank members of the Littman laboratory for valuable discussions and critical reading of the manuscript, and T.

Acetylation of the epsilon-amino group of K40 on alpha-tubulin is a conserved PTM on the luminal side of microtubules(1) that was discovered in the flagella of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii(2,3). Studies on the significance of microtubule acetylation have been limited by the undefined status of the alpha-tubulin acetyltransferase. Here we show that MEC-17, a protein related to the Gcn5 histone acetyltransferases(4) and required for the function of touch receptor neurons in Caenorhabditis elegans(5,6), acts as a K40-specific acetyltransferase for alpha-tubulin. In vitro, MEC-17 exclusively acetylates K40 of alpha-tubulin. Disruption of the Tetrahymena MEC-17 gene phenocopies the K40R alpha-tubulin mutation and makes microtubules more labile. Depletion of MEC-17 in zebrafish produces phenotypes consistent with neuromuscular defects. In C. elegans, MEC-17 and its paralogue W06B11.1 are redundantly required for acetylation of MEC-12 alpha-tubulin, and contribute to the function of touch receptor neurons partly via MEC-12 acetylation and partly via another function, possibly by acetylating another protein. In summary, we identify MEC-17 as an enzyme that acetylates the K40 residue of alpha-tubulin, the only PTM known to occur on the luminal surface of microtubules.","[Akella, Jyothi S.; Wloga, Dorota; Kim, Jihyun; Starostina, Natalia G.; Dougan, Scott T.; Kipreos, Edward T.; Gaertig, Jacek] Univ Georgia, Dept Cellular Biol, Athens, GA 30602 USA; [Lyons-Abbott, Sally; Morrissette, Naomi S.] Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Mol Biol & Biochem, Irvine, CA 92697 USA","Gaertig, J (reprint author), Univ Georgia, Dept Cellular Biol, Athens, GA 30602 USA.",jgaertig@cb.uga.edu,"Dougan, Scott/B-8416-2008; Gaertig, Jacek/F-1553-2010; Wloga, Dorota/R-4078-2016","Dougan, Scott/0000-0003-0214-4772; ","National Science Foundation [MBC-033965]; American Cancer Society [RSG DDC-112979]; National Institutes of Health [R01GM074212, R01AI067981, R01GM089912]","This work was supported by funds from the National Science Foundation (MBC-033965 to J.G.), American Cancer Society (RSG DDC-112979 to S.T.D.), and National Institutes of Health (R01GM074212 to E.

Telomeres avert the former peril by binding sequence-specific end-protection factors that control the access of DDR activities(1,2). The latter threat is tackled by recruiting telomerase, a reverse transcriptase that uses an integral RNA subunit to template the addition of telomere repeats to chromosome ends(3). Here we describe an alternative mode of linear chromosome maintenance in which canonical telomeres are superseded by blocks of heterochromatin. We show that in the absence of telomerase, Schizosaccharomyces pombe cells can survive telomere sequence loss by continually amplifying and rearranging heterochromatic sequences. Because the heterochromatin assembly machinery is required for this survival mode, we have termed it 'HAATI' (heterochromatin amplification-mediated and telomerase-independent). HAATI uses the canonical end-protection protein Pot1 (ref. 4) and its interacting partner Ccq1 (ref. 5) to preserve chromosome linearity. The data suggest a model in which Ccq1 is recruited by the amplified heterochromatin and provides an anchor for Pot1, which accomplishes its end-protection function in the absence of its cognate DNA-binding sequence. HAATI resembles the chromosome end-maintenance strategy found in Drosophila melanogaster, which lacks specific telomere sequences but nonetheless assembles terminal heterochromatin structures that recruit end-protection factors. These findings reveal a previously unrecognized mode by which cancer cells might escape the requirement for telomerase activation, and offer a tool for studying genomes that sustain unusually high levels of heterochromatinization.","[Jain, Devanshi; Cooper, Julia Promisel] Canc Res UK, London Res Inst, London WC2A 3PX, England; [Hebden, Anna K.] Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Ovarian Canc Act Grp, London W12 0NN, England; [Nakamura, Toru M.] Univ Illinois, Dept Biochem & Mol Genet, Chicago, IL 60607 USA; [Miller, Kyle M.] Gurdon Inst, Cambridge CB2 1QN, England","Cooper, JP (reprint author), Canc Res UK, London Res Inst, 44 Lincolns Inn Fields, London WC2A 3PX, England.",julie.cooper@cancer.org.uk,"Nakamura, Toru/B-2055-2008","Nakamura, Toru/0000-0001-5752-0814; Miller, Kyle/0000-0002-4544-0013",Cancer Research UK,We thank T.

Recent studies have uncovered an apparent paradox: although DNA repair is prevented, several proteins involved in DNA damage processing and checkpoint responses are recruited to telomeres in every cell cycle and are required for end protection(1). It is currently not understood how telomeres prevent DNA damage responses from causing permanent cell cycle arrest. Here we show that fission yeast (Schizosaccharomyces pombe) cells lacking Taz1, an orthologue of human TRF1 and TRF2 (ref. 2), recruit DNA repair proteins (Rad22(RAD52) and Rhp51(RAD51), where the superscript indicates the human orthologue) and checkpoint sensors (RPA, Rad9, Rad26(ATRIP) and Cut5/Rad4(TOPBP1)) to telomeres. Despite this, telomeres fail to accumulate the checkpoint mediator Crb2(53BP1) and, consequently, do not activate Chk1-dependent cell cycle arrest. Artificially recruiting Crb2(53BP1) to taz1D telomeres results in a full checkpoint response and cell cycle arrest. Stable association of Crb2(53BP1) to DNA double-strand breaks requires two independent histone modifications: H4 dimethylation at lysine 20 (H4K20me2) and H2A carboxy-terminal phosphorylation (gamma H2A)(3-5). Whereas cH2A can be readily detected, telomeres lack H4K20me2, in contrast to internal chromosome locations. Blocking checkpoint signal transduction at telomeres requires Pot1 and Ccq1, and loss of either Pot1 or Ccq1 from telomeres leads to Crb2(53BP1) foci formation, Chk1 activation and cell cycle arrest. Thus, telomeres constitute a chromatin-privileged region of the chromosomes that lack essential epigenetic markers for DNA damage response amplification and cell cycle arrest. Because the protein kinases ATM and ATR must associate with telomeres in each S phase to recruit telomerase(6), exclusion of Crb2(53BP1) has a critical role in preventing telomeres from triggering cell cycle arrest.","[Carneiro, Tiago; Reis, Clara C.; Borges, Vanessa; Ferreira, Miguel Godinho] Inst Gulbenkian Ciencias, P-2781901 Oeiras, Portugal; [Khair, Lyne; Moser, Bettina A.; Nakamura, Toru M.] Univ Illinois, Dept Biochem & Mol Genet, Chicago, IL 60607 USA","Ferreira, MG (reprint author), Inst Gulbenkian Ciencias, P-2781901 Oeiras, Portugal.",mgferreira@igc.gulbenkian.pt,"Nakamura, Toru/B-2055-2008; Godinho Ferreira, Miguel/F-9290-2012","Nakamura, Toru/0000-0001-5752-0814; Godinho Ferreira, Miguel/0000-0002-8363-7183; Carneiro, Tiago/0000-0001-7909-4182",NIH [GM078253]; FCT [PTDC/BIA-BCM/67261/2006]; Association for International Cancer Research [06-396],"We thank J.

Here we report the structures of the sodium-independent carnitine/butyrobetaine antiporter CaiT from Proteus mirabilis (PmCaiT) at 2.3-angstrom and from Escherichia coli (EcCaiT) at 3.5-angstrom resolution. CaiT belongs to the family of betaine/carnitine/choline transporters (BCCT), which are mostly Na+ or H+ dependent, whereas EcCaiT is Na+ and H+ independent(2). The three-dimensional architecture of CaiT resembles that of the Na+-dependent transporters LeuT(3) and BetP(4), but in CaiT a methionine sulphur takes the place of the Na+ ion to coordinate the substrate in the central transport site, accounting for Na+-independent transport. Both CaiT structures show the fully open, inward-facing conformation, and thus complete the set of functional states that describe the alternating access mechanism(5). EcCaiT contains two bound butyrobetaine substrate molecules, one in the central transport site, the other in an extracellular binding pocket. In the structure of PmCaiT, a tryptophan side chain occupies the transport site, and access to the extracellular site is blocked.

We propose a mechanism whereby the occupied regulatory site increases the binding affinity of the transport site and initiates substrate translocation.","[Schulze, Sabrina; Koester, Stefan; Geldmacher, Ulrike; van Scheltinga, Anke C.

A more complete understanding requires genome-wide studies that fully examine less common alleles in populations with a wide range of ancestry. To inform the design and interpretation of such studies, we genotyped 1.6 million common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 1,184 reference individuals from 11 global populations, and sequenced ten 100-kilobase regions in 692 of these individuals. This integrated data set of common and rare alleles, called 'HapMap 3', includes both SNPs and copy number polymorphisms (CNPs). We characterized population-specific differences among low-frequency variants, measured the improvement in imputation accuracy afforded by the larger reference panel, especially in imputing SNPs with a minor allele frequency of <= 5%, and demonstrated the feasibility of imputing newly discovered CNPs and SNPs. This expanded public resource of genome variants in global populations supports deeper interrogation of genomic variation and its role in human disease, and serves as a step towards a high-resolution map of the landscape of human genetic variation.","[Altshuler, David M.; Schaffner, Stephen F.; de Bakker, Paul I.

But why they selectively become dependent on secretory molecules has remained a mystery, as is the observation that in the central nervous system, most neurons do not show this dependency. Using engineered embryonic stem cells, we show here that the neurotrophin receptors TrkA and TrkC (tropomyosin receptor kinase A and C, also known as Ntrk1 and Ntrk3, respectively) instruct developing neurons to die, both in vitro and in vivo. By contrast, TrkB (also known as Ntrk2), a closely related receptor primarily expressed in the central nervous system, does not. These results indicate that TrkA and TrkC behave as dependence receptors, explaining why developing sympathetic and sensory neurons become trophic-factor-dependent for survival. We suggest that the expansion of the Trk gene family that accompanied the segregation of the peripheral from the central nervous system generated a novel mechanism of cell number control.","[Nikoletopoulou, Vassiliki; Rencurel, Chantal; Zhang, Lixin; Barde, Yves-Alain] Univ Basel, Biozentrum, CH-4056 Basel, Switzerland; [Lickert, Heiko; Giallonardo, Patrizia] Helmholtz Zentrum Munchen, Inst Stem Cell Res, D-85764 Neuherberg, Germany; [Frade, Jose Maria] CSIC, Inst Cajal, E-28002 Madrid, Spain; [Bibel, Miriam] Novartis Inst BioMed Res, Neurodegenerat Dept, CH-4002 Basel, Switzerland","Nikoletopoulou, V (reprint author), Univ Basel, Biozentrum, CH-4056 Basel, Switzerland.",n.vassiliki@unibas.ch; yves.barde@unibas.ch,"Barde, Yves/F-6019-2011; Frade, Jose/E-7913-2013; Lickert, Heiko/K-9045-2013","Frade, Jose/0000-0001-7067-2505; Barde, Yves/0000-0002-7627-461X",DFG; consortium EuTRACC; Swiss National Foundation,"H.L. is supported by an Emmy-Nother fellowship of the DFG.

Several explanations for the water were postulated, including the vaporization of icy bodies (comets or dwarf planets) in orbit around the star(1), grain surface reactions(3), and photochemistry in the outer circumstellar envelope(4). With a single water line detected so far from this one carbon-rich evolved star, it is difficult to discriminate between the different mechanisms proposed. Here we report the detection of dozens of water vapour lines in the far-infrared and sub-millimetre spectrum of IRC + 10216 using the Herschel satellite(5). This includes some high-excitation lines with energies corresponding to similar to 1,000 K, which can be explained only if water is present in the warm inner sooty region of the envelope. A plausible explanation for the warm water appears to be the penetration of ultraviolet photons deep into a clumpy circumstellar envelope. This mechanism also triggers the formation of other molecules, such as ammonia, whose observed abundances(6) are much higher than hitherto predicted(7).","[Decin, L.; Lombaert, R.; De Beck, E.; Royer, P.; Vandenbussche, B.; Blommaert, J.

For several years, researchers have aspired to extend such detection possibilities to larger-scale, strongly correlated quantum systems(1,2) in order to record in situ images of a quantum fluid in which each underlying quantum particle is detected. Here we report fluorescence imaging of strongly interacting bosonic Mott insulators in an optical lattice with single-atom and single-site resolution. From our images, we fully reconstruct the atom distribution on the lattice and identify individual excitations with high fidelity. A comparison of the radial density and variance distributions with theory provides a precise in situ temperature and entropy measurement from single images. We observe Mott-insulating plateaus with near-zero entropy and clearly resolve the high-entropy rings separating them, even though their width is of the order of just a single lattice site. Furthermore, we show how a Mott insulator melts with increasing temperature, owing to a proliferation of local defects. The ability to resolve individual lattice sites directly opens up new avenues for the manipulation, analysis and applications of strongly interacting quantum gases on a lattice. For example, one could introduce local perturbations or access regions of high entropy, a crucial requirement for the implementation of novel cooling schemes(3).","[Sherson, Jacob F.; Weitenberg, Christof; Endres, Manuel; Cheneau, Marc; Bloch, Immanuel; Kuhr, Stefan] Max Planck Inst Quantum Opt, D-85748 Garching, Germany; [Bloch, Immanuel] Univ Munich, D-80799 Munich, Germany","Kuhr, S (reprint author), Max Planck Inst Quantum Opt, Hans Kopfermann Str 1, D-85748 Garching, Germany.",stefan.kuhr@mpq.mpg.de,"Bloch, Immanuel/G-3174-2010; Kuhr, Stefan/F-7296-2011; Cheneau, Marc/O-9312-2014","Bloch, Immanuel/0000-0002-0679-4759; Cheneau, Marc/0000-0001-7261-566X",MPG; DFG; Stiftung Rheinland-Pfalz fur Innovation; Carl-Zeiss Stiftung; EU,"We thank R.

Similarities between these systems, such as the inherent polarity of the constituents, a density-dependent transition to ordered phases or the existence of very large density fluctuations(13-16), suggest universal principles underlying pattern formation. This idea is followed by theoretical models at all levels of description: micro-or mesoscopic models directly map local forces and interactions using only a few, preferably simple, interaction rules(12,17-21), and more macroscopic approaches in the hydrodynamic limit rely on the systems' generic symmetries(8,22,23). All these models characteristically have a broad parameter space with a manifold of possible patterns, most of which have not yet been experimentally verified. The complexity of interactions and the limited parameter control of existing experimental systems are major obstacles to our understanding of the underlying ordering principles(13). Here we demonstrate the emergence of collective motion in a high-density motility assay that consists of highly concentrated actin filaments propelled by immobilized molecular motors in a planar geometry. Above a critical density, the filaments self-organize to form coherently moving structures with persistent density modulations, such as clusters, swirls and interconnected bands. These polar nematic structures are long lived and can span length scales orders of magnitudes larger than their constituents. Our experimental approach, which offers control of all relevant system parameters, complemented by agent-based simulations, allows backtracking of the assembly and disassembly pathways to the underlying local interactions. We identify weak and local alignment interactions to be essential for the observed formation of patterns and their dynamics. The presented minimal polar-pattern-forming system may thus provide new insight into emerging order in the broad class of active fluids(8,23,24) and self-propelled particles(17,25)","[Schaller, Volker; Semmrich, Christine; Bausch, Andreas R.] Tech Univ Munich, Lehrstuhl Biophy E27, D-85748 Garching, Germany; [Weber, Christoph; Frey, Erwin] Univ Munich, Dept Phys, Arnold Sommerfeld Ctr Theoret Phys, D-80333 Munich, Germany; [Weber, Christoph; Frey, Erwin] Univ Munich, Dept Phys, CENS, D-80333 Munich, Germany","Bausch, AR (reprint author), Tech Univ Munich, Lehrstuhl Biophy E27, D-85748 Garching, Germany.",abausch@ph.tum.de,,"Frey, Erwin/0000-0001-8792-3358",DFG [SFB 863]; German Excellence Initiatives via the 'Nano-Initiative Munich (NIM)'; Technische Universitat Munchen - Institute for Advanced Study; Elite Network of Bavaria,We thank A.

They extend laterally for hundreds of kilometres, and are underlain to depths of 180-250 km by mantle roots that are chemically and physically distinct from the surrounding mantle(2-4). Forming the thickest lithosphere on our planet, they act as rigid keels isolated from the flowing asthenosphere(5); however, it has remained an open question how these large portions of the mantle can stay isolated for so long from mantle convection. Key physical properties thought to contribute to this longevity include chemical buoyancy due to high degrees of melt-depletion and the stiffness imparted by the low temperatures of a conductive thermal gradient(2,6,7). Geodynamic calculations, however, suggest that these characteristics are not sufficient to prevent the lithospheric mantle from being entrained during mantle convection over billions of years(6,7). Differences in water content are a potential source of additional viscosity contrast between cratonic roots and ambient mantle owing to the well-established hydrolytic weakening effect in olivine(8-10), the most abundant mineral of the upper mantle. However, the water contents of cratonic mantle roots have to date been poorly constrained. Here we show that olivine in peridotite xenoliths from the lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary region of the Kaapvaal craton mantle root are water-poor and provide sufficient viscosity contrast with underlying asthenosphere to satisfy the stability criteria required by geodynamic calculations(9). Our results provide a solution to a puzzling mystery of plate tectonics, namely why the oldest continents, in contrast to short-lived oceanic plates, have resisted recycling into the interior of our tectonically dynamic planet.","[Peslier, Anne H.] ESCG, Houston, TX 77058 USA; [Peslier, Anne H.] NASA, Lyndon B Johnson Space Ctr, Houston, TX 77058 USA; [Woodland, Alan B.; Lazarov, Marina] Goethe Univ Frankfurt, Inst Geosci, D-60438 Frankfurt, Germany; [Bell, David R.] Arizona State Univ, Sch Earth & Space Explorat, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA","Peslier, AH (reprint author), ESCG, Mail Code JE23,2224 Bay Area Blvd, Houston, TX 77058 USA.",anne.h.peslier@nasa.gov,"Lazarov, Marina/A-9592-2010; Peslier, Anne/F-3956-2010",,NSF [EAR0802652],"We thank M.

Resistance alleles in drug target-specific sites and general stress responses have been identified in individual end-point isolates(1-7). Less is known, however, about the population dynamics during the development of antibiotic-resistant strains. Here we follow a continuous culture of Escherichia coli facing increasing levels of antibiotic and show that the vast majority of isolates are less resistant than the population as a whole. We find that the few highly resistant mutants improve the survival of the population's less resistant constituents, in part by producing indole, a signalling molecule generated by actively growing, unstressed cells(8). We show, through transcriptional profiling, that indole serves to turn on drug efflux pumps and oxidative-stress protective mechanisms. The indole production comes at a fitness cost to the highly resistant isolates, and whole-genome sequencing reveals that this bacterial altruism is made possible by drug-resistance mutations unrelated to indole production. This work establishes a population-based resistance mechanism constituting a form of kin selection(9) whereby a small number of resistant mutants can, at some cost to themselves, provide protection to other, more vulnerable, cells, enhancing the survival capacity of the overall population in stressful environments.","[Lee, Henry H.; Molla, Michael N.; Collins, James J.] Howard Hughes Med Inst, Ctr BioDynam, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Lee, Henry H.; Molla, Michael N.; Cantor, Charles R.; Collins, James J.] Boston Univ, Dept Biomed Engn, Ctr Adv Biotechnol, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Collins, James J.] Harvard Univ, Wyss Inst Biologically Inspired Engn, Boston, MA 02215 USA","Collins, JJ (reprint author), Howard Hughes Med Inst, Ctr BioDynam, Boston, MA 02115 USA.",jcollins@bu.edu,,,National Institutes of Health [DP1OD003644]; National Science Foundation [DMS-0602204]; Howard Hughes Medical Institute,"We thank M.

Components of the miRNA machinery and miRNAs themselves are involved in many cellular processes that are altered in cancer, such as differentiation, proliferation and apoptosis. Some miRNAs, referred to as oncomiRs(2), show differential expression levels in cancer and are able to affect cellular transformation, carcinogenesis and metastasis, acting either as oncogenes or tumour suppressors. The phenomenon of 'oncogene addiction' reveals that despite the multistep nature of tumorigenesis, targeting of certain single oncogenes can have therapeutic value(3,4), and the possibility of oncomiR addiction has been proposed but never demonstrated(3). MicroRNA-21 (miR-21) is a unique miRNA in that it is overexpressed in most tumour types analysed so far. Despite great interest in miR-21, most of the data implicating it in cancer have been obtained through miRNA profiling and limited in vitro functional assays. To explore the role of miR-21 in cancer in vivo, we used Cre and Tet-off technologies to generate mice conditionally expressing miR-21. Here we show that overexpression of miR-21 leads to a pre-B malignant lymphoid-like phenotype, demonstrating that mir-21 is a genuine oncogene. When miR-21 was inactivated, the tumours regressed completely in a few days, partly as a result of apoptosis. These results demonstrate that tumours can become addicted to oncomiRs and support efforts to treat human cancers through pharmacological inactivation of miRNAs such as miR-21.","[Medina, Pedro P.; Nolde, Mona; Slack, Frank J.] Yale Univ, Dept Mol Cellular & Dev Biol, New Haven, CT 06520 USA","Slack, FJ (reprint author), Yale Univ, Dept Mol Cellular & Dev Biol, POB 208103, New Haven, CT 06520 USA.",frank.slack@yale.edu,"Medina, Pedro/D-1688-2013","Medina, Pedro/0000-0002-7834-7093; Slack, Frank/0000-0001-8263-0409",Hope Funds for Cancer Research; James McDonnell Foundation; Yale Comprehensive Cancer Center,"We thank X.

Rotation or displacement of the spindle results in two furrows: an early polarity-induced basal furrow and a later spindle-induced furrow.

Formation of amyloid-beta is catalysed by gamma-secretase, a protease with numerous substrates(2,3). Little is known about the molecular mechanisms that confer substrate specificity on this potentially promiscuous enzyme. Knowledge of the mechanisms underlying its selectivity is critical for the development of clinically effective gamma-secretase inhibitors that can reduce amyloid-beta formation without impairing cleavage of other gamma-secretase substrates, especially Notch, which is essential for normal biological functions(3,4). Here we report the discovery of a novel gamma-secretase activating protein (GSAP) that drastically and selectively increases amyloid-beta production through a mechanism involving its interactions with both gamma-secretase and its substrate, the amyloid precursor protein carboxy-terminal fragment (APP-CTF). GSAP does not interact with Notch, nor does it affect its cleavage. Recombinant GSAP stimulates amyloid-beta production in vitro. Reducing GSAP concentrations in cell lines decreases amyloid-beta concentrations. Knockdown of GSAP in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease reduces levels of amyloid-beta and plaque development. GSAP represents a type of gamma-secretase regulator that directs enzyme specificity by interacting with a specific substrate. We demonstrate that imatinib, an anticancer drug previously found to inhibit amyloid-beta formation without affecting Notch cleavage 5, achieves its amyloid-beta-lowering effect by preventing GSAP interaction with the gamma-secretase substrate, APP-CTF. Thus, GSAP can serve as an amyloid-beta-lowering therapeutic target without affecting other key functions of gamma-secretase.","[He, Gen; Luo, Wenjie; Remmers, Christine; Netzer, William J.; Bettayeb, Karima; Flajolet, Marc; Greengard, Paul] Rockefeller Univ, Mol & Cellular Neurosci Lab, New York, NY 10065 USA; [Li, Peng; Hendrick, Joseph; Wennogle, Lawrence P.] Intra Cellular Therapies Inc, New York, NY 10032 USA; [Gorelick, Fred] Yale Univ, Sch Med, Dept Internal Med & Cell Biol, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Gorelick, Fred] VA Connecticut Healthcare, New Haven, CT 06520 USA","Greengard, P (reprint author), Rockefeller Univ, Mol & Cellular Neurosci Lab, 1230 York Ave, New York, NY 10065 USA.",greengard@rockefeller.edu,,,NIH [AG09464]; DOD [W81XWH-09-1-0402]; Fisher Center for Alzheimer's Research Foundation; F.

Crystal structures of the potassium-bound form of the pump revealed an intimate docking of the alpha-subunit carboxy terminus at the transmembrane domain(1,2). Here we show that this element is a key regulator of a previously unrecognized ion pathway. Current models of P-type ATPases operate with a single ion conduit through the pump(3-5), but our data suggest an additional pathway in the Na+/K+-ATPase between the ion-binding sites and the cytoplasm. The C-terminal pathway allows a cytoplasmic proton to enter and stabilize site III when empty in the potassium-bound state, and when potassium is released the proton will also return to the cytoplasm, thus allowing an overall asymmetric stoichiometry of the transported ions. The C terminus controls the gate to the pathway. Its structure is crucial for pump function, as demonstrated by at least eight mutations in the region that cause severe neurological diseases(6,7). This novel model for ion transport by the Na+/K+-ATPase is established by electrophysiological studies of C-terminal mutations in familial hemiplegic migraine 2 (FHM2) and is further substantiated by molecular dynamics simulations. A similar ion regulation is likely to apply to the H+/K+-ATPase and the Ca2+-ATPase.","[Poulsen, Hanne; Morth, J.

We apply PARS to profile the secondary structure of the messenger RNAs (mRNAs) of the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and obtain structural profiles for over 3,000 distinct transcripts. Analysis of these profiles reveals several RNA structural properties of yeast transcripts, including the existence of more secondary structure over coding regions compared with untranslated regions, a three-nucleotide periodicity of secondary structure across coding regions and an anti-correlation between the efficiency with which an mRNA is translated and the structure over its translation start site. PARS is readily applicable to other organisms and to profiling RNA structure in diverse conditions, thus enabling studies of the dynamics of secondary structure at a genomic scale.","[Wan, Yue; Chang, Howard Y.] Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Program Epithelial Biol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Kertesz, Michael; Mazor, Elad; Segal, Eran] Weizmann Inst Sci, Dept Comp Sci & Appl Math, IL-76100 Rehovot, Israel; [Rinn, John L.] Harvard Univ, Broad Inst, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; [Rinn, John L.] MIT, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; [Nutter, Robert C.] Life Technol, Foster City, CA 94404 USA; [Segal, Eran] Weizmann Inst Sci, Dept Mol Cell Biol, IL-76100 Rehovot, Israel","Chang, HY (reprint author), Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Program Epithelial Biol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",howchang@stanford.edu; eran@weizmann.ac.il,,"Segal, Eran/0000-0002-6859-1164","National Institutes of Health [RO1HG004361]; Agency of Science, Technology and Research of Singapore","We thank D.

DSB ends are resected in a 5' to 3' fashion in cells, to yield single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) for the recruitment of factors critical for DNA damage checkpoint activation and repair by homologous recombination 2. The resection process involves redundant pathways consisting of nucleases, DNA helicases and associated proteins(3). Being guided by recent genetic studies(4-6), we have reconstituted the first eukaryotic ATP-dependent DNA end-resection machinery comprising the Saccharomyces cerevisiae Mre11-Rad50-Xrs2 (MRX) complex, the Sgs1-Top3-Rmi1 complex, Dna2 protein and the heterotrimeric ssDNA-binding protein RPA. Here we show that DNA strand separation during end resection is mediated by the Sgs1 helicase function, in a manner that is enhanced by Top3-Rmi1 and MRX. In congruence with genetic observations(6), although the Dna2 nuclease activity is critical for resection, the Mre11 nuclease activity is dispensable. By examining the top3 Y356F allele and its encoded protein, we provide evidence that the topoisomerase activity of Top3, although critical for the suppression of crossover recombination(2,7), is not needed for resection either in cells or in the reconstituted system. Our results also unveil a multifaceted role of RPA, in the sequestration of ssDNA generated by DNA unwinding, enhancement of 5' strand incision, and protection of the 3' strand. Our reconstituted system should serve as a useful model for delineating the mechanistic intricacy of the DNA break resection process in eukaryotes.","[Chung, Woo-Hyun; Zhu, Zhu; Ira, Grzegorz] Baylor Coll Med, Dept Mol & Human Genet, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Niu, Hengyao; Kwon, Youngho; Zhao, Weixing; Chi, Peter; Prakash, Rohit; Seong, Changhyun; Liu, Dongqing; Lu, Lucy; Sung, Patrick] Yale Univ, Sch Med, Dept Mol Biophys & Biochem, New Haven, CT 06520 USA","Ira, G (reprint author), Baylor Coll Med, Dept Mol & Human Genet, 1 Baylor Plaza, Houston, TX 77030 USA.",gira@bcm.edu; patrick.sung@yale.edu,"zhao, weixing/H-3154-2013; Niu, Hengyao/J-4593-2013; Niu, Hengyao/B-5026-2014","CHI, HUNG-YUAN/0000-0001-9229-8729",US National Institutes of Health; Susan G.

For repair to start, the DSB must first be resected to generate a 3'-single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) overhang, which becomes a substrate for the DNA strand exchange protein, Rad51 (ref. 1). Genetic studies have implicated a multitude of proteins in the process, including helicases, nucleases and topoisomerases(2-4). Here we biochemically reconstitute elements of the resection process and reveal that it requires the nuclease Dna2, the RecQ-family helicase Sgs1 and the ssDNA-binding protein replication protein-A (RPA). We establish that Dna2, Sgs1 and RPA constitute a minimal protein complex capable of DNA resection in vitro. Sgs1 helicase unwinds the DNA to produce an intermediate that is digested by Dna2, and RPA stimulates DNA unwinding by Sgs1 in a species-specific manner. Interestingly, RPA is also required both to direct Dna2 nucleolytic activity to the 5'-terminated strand of the DNA break and to inhibit 39 to 59 degradation by Dna2, actions that generate and protect the 3'-ssDNA overhang, respectively. In addition to this core machinery, we establish that both the topoisomerase 3 (Top3) and Rmi1 complex and the Mre11-Rad50-Xrs2 complex (MRX) have important roles as stimulatory components. Stimulation of end resection by the Top3-Rmi1 heterodimer and the MRX proteins is by complex formation with Sgs1 (refs 5, 6), which unexpectedly stimulates DNA unwinding. We suggest that Top3-Rmi1 and MRX are important for recruitment of the Sgs1-Dna2 complex to DSBs. Our experiments provide a mechanistic framework for understanding the initial steps of recombinational DNA repair in eukaryotes.","[Cejka, Petr; Cannavo, Elda; Kowalczykowski, Stephen C.] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Microbiol, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Cejka, Petr; Cannavo, Elda; Kowalczykowski, Stephen C.] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Mol & Cellular Biol, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Polaczek, Piotr; Masuda-Sasa, Taro; Pokharel, Subhash; Campbell, Judith L.] CALTECH, Div Biol, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA","Kowalczykowski, SC (reprint author), Univ Calif Davis, Dept Microbiol, Davis, CA 95616 USA.",sckowalczykowski@ucdavis.edu,"Cejka, Petr/B-4829-2009","Cejka, Petr/0000-0002-9087-032X","Swiss National Science Foundation; National Institutes of Health [GM-78666, GM-41347, GM-62653]","We thank J.-B.

Here we use an ocean circulation model and observed nutrient distributions to show that the N/P ratio of biological nutrient removal varies across latitude in Southern Ocean surface waters, from 12: 1 in the polar ocean to 20: 1 in the sub-Antarctic zone. These variations are governed by regional differences in the species composition of the plankton community. The covariation of dissolved nitrate and phosphate is maintained by ocean circulation, which mixes the shallow subsurface nutrients between distinct biogeographic provinces.

Here we present the first worldwide synthesis to jointly consider human and biodiversity perspectives on water security using a spatial framework that quantifies multiple stressors and accounts for downstream impacts. We find that nearly 80% of the world's population is exposed to high levels of threat to water security. Massive investment in water technology enables rich nations to offset high stressor levels without remedying their underlying causes, whereas less wealthy nations remain vulnerable. A similar lack of precautionary investment jeopardizes biodiversity, with habitats associated with 65% of continental discharge classified as moderately to highly threatened. The cumulative threat framework offers a tool for prioritizing policy and management responses to this crisis, and underscores the necessity of limiting threats at their source instead of through costly remediation of symptoms in order to assure global water security for both humans and freshwater biodiversity.","[Voeroesmarty, C.

Despite intense theoretical and experimental efforts, however, polarized superconductivity remains largely elusive(3). Unlike the three-dimensional (3D) case, theories predict that in one dimension (1D) a state with FFLO correlations occupies a major part of the phase diagram(4-12). Here we report experimental measurements of density profiles of a two-spin mixture of ultracold (6)Li atoms trapped in an array of 1D tubes (a system analogous to electrons in 1D wires). At finite spin imbalance, the system phase separates with an inverted phase profile, as compared to the 3D case. In 1D, we find a partially polarized core surrounded by wings which, depending on the degree of polarization, are composed of either a completely paired or a fully polarized Fermi gas.

The measurement of correlations between entangled particles can have results at odds with classical behaviour. These discrepancies grow exponentially with the number of entangled particles(1). With the ample experimental(2-4) confirmation of quantum mechanical predictions, entanglement has evolved from a philosophical conundrum into a key resource for technologies such as quantum communication and computation(5). Although entanglement in superconducting circuits has been limited so far to two qubits(6-9), the extension of entanglement to three, eight and ten qubits has been achieved among spins(10), ions(11) and photons(12), respectively. A key question for solid-state quantum information processing is whether an engineered system could display the multi-qubit entanglement necessary for quantum error correction, which starts with tripartite entanglement. Here, using a circuit quantum electrodynamics architecture(13,14), we demonstrate deterministic production of three-qubit Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) states(15) with fidelity of 88 per cent, measured with quantum state tomography. Several entanglement witnesses detect genuine three-qubit entanglement by violating biseparable bounds by 830 +/- 80 per cent. We demonstrate the first step of basic quantum error correction, namely the encoding of a logical qubit into a manifold of GHZ-like states using a repetition code. The integration of this encoding with decoding and error-correcting steps in a feedback loop will be the next step for quantum computing with integrated circuits.","[DiCarlo, L.; Reed, M.

Subglacial water is known to occupy systems of cavities and conduits at the interface between ice and the underlying bed surface, depending upon the history of water input and the characteristics of the substrate(5). Full understanding of the extent and configuration of basal water is lacking, however, because direct observation is difficult. This limits our ability to simulate ice dynamics and the subsequent impacts on sea-level rise realistically. Here we show that the subglacial hydrological system can have a large volume of water occupying basal crevasses that extend upward from the bed into the overlying ice. Radar and seismic imaging combined with in situ borehole measurements collected on Bench Glacier, Alaska, reveal numerous water-filled basal crevasses with highly transmissive connections to the bed. Some crevasses extend many tens of metres above the bed and together they hold a volume of water equivalent to at least a decimetre layer covering the bed. Our results demonstrate that the basal hydrologic system can extend high into the overlying ice mass, where basal crevasses increase water-storage capacity and could potentially modulate basal water pressure. Because basal crevasses can form under commonly observed glaciological conditions, our findings have implications for interpreting and modelling subglacial hydrologic processes and related sliding accelerations of glaciers and ice sheets.","[Harper, Joel T.; Meierbachtol, Toby W.] Univ Montana, Dept Geosci, Missoula, MT 59812 USA; [Bradford, John H.] Boise State Univ, Ctr Geophys Invest Shallow Subsurface, Boise, ID 83725 USA; [Humphrey, Neil F.] Univ Wyoming, Dept Geol & Geophys, Laramie, WY 82071 USA","Harper, JT (reprint author), Univ Montana, Dept Geosci, Missoula, MT 59812 USA.",joel@mso.umt.edu,,,US National Science Foundation Office; Arctic Natural Sciences,"This work was funded by the US National Science Foundation Office of Polar Programs, Arctic Natural Sciences.",,28,32,32,1,22,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,SEP,2010,467,7315,,,,,579,582,,10.1038/nature09398,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,655TT,WOS:000282273100036,20882014,No,,,11/20/17

Felzer and Brodsky(10) examined the distance distribution of earthquakes occurring in the first five minutes after 2 <= M < 3 and 3 <= M < 4 mainshocks and found that their magnitude M >= 2 aftershocks showed a uniform power-law decay with slope -1.35 out to 50 km from the mainshocks. From this they argued that the distance decay could be explained only by dynamic triggering. Here we propose an alternative explanation for the decay, and subject their hypothesis to a series of tests, none of which it passes. At distances more than 300 m from the 2 <= M < 3 mainshocks, the seismicity decay 5 min before the mainshocks is indistinguishable from the decay five minutes afterwards, indicating that the mainshocks have no effect at distances outside their static triggering range. Omori temporal decay, the fundamental signature of aftershocks, is absent at distances exceeding 10 km from the mainshocks. Finally, the distance decay is found among aftershocks that occur before the arrival of the seismic wave front from the mainshock, which violates causality. We argue that Felzer and Brodsky(10) implicitly assume that the first of two independent aftershocks along a fault rupture triggers the second, and that the first of two shocks in a creep-or intrusion-driven swarm triggers the second, when this need not be the case.","[Richards-Dinger, Keith] Univ Calif Riverside, Dept Earth Sci, Riverside, CA 92521 USA; [Stein, Ross S.] US Geol Survey, Menlo Pk, CA 94025 USA; [Toda, Shinji] Kyoto Univ, Disaster Prevent Res Inst, Kyoto 6110011, Japan","Richards-Dinger, K (reprint author), Univ Calif Riverside, Dept Earth Sci, Riverside, CA 92521 USA.",keithrd@ucr.edu,,,,,,31,52,52,4,28,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,SEP,2010,467,7315,,,,,583,U105,,10.1038/nature09402,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,655TT,WOS:000282273100037,20882015,No,,,11/20/17

Here we present whole-genome resequencing data from Drosophila melanogaster populations that have experienced over 600 generations of laboratory selection for accelerated development. Flies in these selected populations develop from egg to adult similar to 20% faster than flies of ancestral control populations, and have evolved a number of other correlated phenotypes. On the basis of 688,520 intermediate-frequency, high-quality single nucleotide polymorphisms, we identify several dozen genomic regions that show strong allele frequency differentiation between a pooled sample of five replicate populations selected for accelerated development and pooled controls. On the basis of resequencing data from a single replicate population with accelerated development, as well as single nucleotide polymorphism data from individual flies from each replicate population, we infer little allele frequency differentiation between replicate populations within a selection treatment. Signatures of selection are qualitatively different than what has been observed in asexual species; in our sexual populations, adaptation is not associated with 'classic' sweeps whereby newly arising, unconditionally advantageous mutations become fixed. More parsimonious explanations include 'incomplete' sweep models, in which mutations have not had enough time to fix, and 'soft' sweep models, in which selection acts on pre-existing, common genetic variants. We conclude that, at least for life history characters such as development time, unconditionally advantageous alleles rarely arise, are associated with small net fitness gains or cannot fix because selection coefficients change over time.","[Burke, Molly K.; Shahrestani, Parvin; Thornton, Kevin R.; Rose, Michael R.; Long, Anthony D.] Univ Calif Irvine, Irvine, CA 92697 USA; [Dunham, Joseph P.] Univ So Calif, Los Angeles, CA 90098 USA","Burke, MK (reprint author), Univ Calif Irvine, 321 Steinhaus Hall, Irvine, CA 92697 USA.",burkem@uci.edu; tdlong@uci.edu,"Marion-Poll, Frederic/D-8882-2011","Marion-Poll, Frederic/0000-0001-6824-0180; Long, Tony/0000-0002-5007-8514; Rose, Michael/0000-0002-7766-0731","UCI; NSF [DEB-0614429, DGE-0638751]","We thank K.

However, this type of binding is not always possible. For example, the small number of gp140 glycoprotein spikes displayed on the surface of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) disfavours homotypic bivalent antibody binding(1-3). Here we show that during the human antibody response to HIV, somatic mutations that increase antibody affinity also increase breadth and neutralizing potency. Surprisingly, the responding naive and memory B cells produce polyreactive antibodies, which are capable of bivalent heteroligation between one high-affinity anti-HIV-gp140 combining site and a second low-affinity site on another molecular structure on HIV. Although cross-reactivity to self-antigens or polyreactivity is strongly selected against during B-cell development(4), it is a common serologic feature of certain infections in humans, including HIV, Epstein-Barr virus and hepatitis C virus. Seventy-five per cent of the 134 monoclonal anti-HIV-gp140 antibodies cloned from six patients(5) with high titres of neutralizing antibodies are polyreactive. Despite the low affinity of the polyreactive combining site, heteroligation demonstrably increases the apparent affinity of polyreactive antibodies to HIV.","[Mouquet, Hugo; Scheid, Johannes F.; Pietzsch, John; Nussenzweig, Michel C.] Rockefeller Univ, Lab Mol Immunol, New York, NY 10065 USA; [Scheid, Johannes F.] Charite, D-10117 Berlin, Germany; [Zoller, Markus J.; Wardemann, Hedda] Max Planck Inst Infect Biol, D-10117 Berlin, Germany; [Krogsgaard, Michelle] NYU, Sch Med, Dept Pathol, New York, NY 10016 USA; [Krogsgaard, Michelle] NYU, Sch Med, Inst Canc, New York, NY 10016 USA; [Ott, Rene G.; Ravetch, Jeffrey V.] Rockefeller Univ, Lab Mol Genet & Immunol, New York, NY 10065 USA; [Shukair, Shetha; Hope, Thomas J.] Northwestern Univ, Dept Cell & Mol Biol, Chicago, IL 60611 USA; [Artyomov, Maxim N.; Eisen, Herman N.; Chakraborty, Arup K.] MIT, Dept Chem, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Artyomov, Maxim N.; Eisen, Herman N.; Chakraborty, Arup K.] MIT, Dept Chem Engn, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Artyomov, Maxim N.; Eisen, Herman N.; Chakraborty, Arup K.] MIT, Dept Biol, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Artyomov, Maxim N.; Eisen, Herman N.; Chakraborty, Arup K.] MIT, Dept Biol Engn, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Artyomov, Maxim N.; Eisen, Herman N.; Chakraborty, Arup K.] MIT, Koch Inst Integrat Canc Res, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Pietzsch, John] Free Univ Berlin, Inst Chem & Biochem, D-14195 Berlin, Germany; [Connors, Mark] NIAID, Immunoregulat Lab, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Connors, Mark] NIAID, Vaccine Res Ctr, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Pereyra, Florencia; Walker, Bruce D.] MIT, Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Ragon Inst, Boston, MA 02114 USA; [Pereyra, Florencia; Walker, Bruce D.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Boston, MA 02114 USA; [Ho, David D.] Aaron Diamond AIDS Res Ctr, New York, NY 10016 USA; [Wilson, Patrick C.] Univ Chicago, Dept Med, Rheumatol Sect, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Seaman, Michael S.] Beth Israel Deaconess Med Ctr, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Nussenzweig, Michel C.] Rockefeller Univ, Howard Hughes Med Inst, New York, NY 10065 USA","Nussenzweig, MC (reprint author), Rockefeller Univ, Lab Mol Immunol, New York, NY 10065 USA.",nussenzweig@rockefeller.edu,"Mouquet, Hugo/M-2750-2014",,"Rockefeller University; National Institutes of Health [NIH 1 PO1 AI081677, R01 AI047770]; International AIDS Vaccine Initiative; Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation; German Research Foundation [GRK1121]","We thank J.

The finding that oncogenic mutations in BRAF are common in melanoma(2), followed by the demonstration that these tumours are dependent on the RAF/MEK/ERK pathway(3), offered hope that inhibition of B-RAF kinase activity could benefit melanoma patients. Herein, we describe the structure-guided discovery of PLX4032 (RG7204), a potent inhibitor of oncogenic B-RAF kinase activity. Preclinical experiments demonstrated that PLX4032 selectively blocked the RAF/MEK/ERK pathway in BRAF mutant cells and caused regression of BRAF mutant xenografts(4). Toxicology studies confirmed a wide safety margin consistent with the high degree of selectivity, enabling Phase 1 clinical trials using a crystalline formulation of PLX4032 (ref. 5). In a subset of melanoma patients, pathway inhibition was monitored in paired biopsy specimens collected before treatment initiation and following two weeks of treatment. This analysis revealed substantial inhibition of ERK phosphorylation, yet clinical evaluation did not show tumour regressions. At higher drug exposures afforded by a new amorphous drug formulation(4,5), greater than 80% inhibition of ERK phosphorylation in the tumours of patients correlated with clinical response. Indeed, the Phase 1 clinical data revealed a remarkably high 81% response rate in metastatic melanoma patients treated at an oral dose of 960 mg twice daily(5). These data demonstrate that BRAF-mutant melanomas are highly dependent on B-RAF kinase activity.","[Bollag, Gideon; Hirth, Peter; Tsai, James; Zhang, Jiazhong; Ibrahim, Prabha N.; Cho, Hanna; Spevak, Wayne; Zhang, Chao; Zhang, Ying; Habets, Gaston; Burton, ElizabethA.; Wong, Bernice; Tsang, Garson; West, Brian L.; Powell, Ben; Shellooe, Rafe; Marimuthu, Adhirai; Nguyen, Hoa; Zhang, Kam Y.

Small molecules can passively diffuse through the NPC, whereas larger cargos require transport receptors to translocate(1). How the NPC facilitates the translocation of transport receptor/cargo complexes remains unclear. To investigate this process, we tracked single protein-functionalized quantum dot cargos as they moved through human NPCs. Here we show that import proceeds by successive substeps comprising cargo capture, filtering and translocation, and release into the nucleus. Most quantum dots are rejected at one of these steps and return to the cytoplasm, including very large cargos that abort at a size-selective barrier. Cargo movement in the central channel is subdiffusive and cargos that can bind more transport receptors diffuse more freely. Without Ran GTPase, a critical regulator of transport directionality(1), cargos still explore the entire NPC, but have a markedly reduced probability of exit into the nucleus, suggesting that NPC entry and exit steps are not equivalent and that the pore is functionally asymmetric to importing cargos. The overall selectivity of the NPC seems to arise from the cumulative action of multiple reversible substeps and a final irreversible exit step.","[Lowe, Alan R.; Siegel, Jake J.; Weis, Karsten; Liphardt, Jan T.] Univ Calif Berkeley, QB3, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Lowe, Alan R.; Liphardt, Jan T.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Phys, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Lowe, Alan R.; Liphardt, Jan T.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Bay Area Phys Sci Oncol Ctr, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Siegel, Jake J.; Siu, Merek; Liphardt, Jan T.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Biophys Grad Grp, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Kalab, Petr; Weis, Karsten] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mol & Cellular Biol, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Lowe, Alan R.; Liphardt, Jan T.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Lawrence Berkeley Lab, Phys Biosci Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA","Weis, K (reprint author), Univ Calif Berkeley, QB3, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",kweis@berkeley.edu,"Weis, Karsten/F-5719-2011; Liphardt, Jan/A-5906-2012; Kalab, Petr/B-2478-2009","Weis, Karsten/0000-0001-7224-925X; Lowe, Alan/0000-0002-0558-3597; Liphardt, Jan/0000-0003-2835-5025","NIH [GM058065, GM77856]; NCI [U54CA143836]","We thank H.

Hence, mRNA export occurs over distances smaller than the optical resolution of conventional light microscopes. There is extensive knowledge on the physical structure and composition of the nuclear pore complex(2-7), but transport selectivity and the dynamics of mRNA export at nuclear pores remain unknown(8). Here we developed a super-registration approach using fluorescence microscopy that can overcome the current limitations of co-localization by means of measuring intermolecular distances of chromatically different fluorescent molecules with nanometre precision. With this method we achieve 20-ms time-precision and at least 26-nm spatial precision, enabling the capture of highly transient interactions in living cells. Using this approach we were able to spatially resolve the kinetics of mRNA transport in mammalian cells and present a three-step model consisting of docking (80 ms), transport (5-20 ms) and release (80 ms), totalling 180 +/- 10 ms.

It is generally believed that 5'-end capping is a constitutive process that occurs during mRNA maturation and lacks the need for a quality-control mechanism to ensure its fidelity. We recently reported that the yeast Rai1 protein has pyrophosphohydrolase activity towards mRNAs lacking a 5'-end cap(4). Here we show that, in vitro as well as in yeast cells, Rai1 possesses a novel decapping endonuclease activity that can also remove the entire cap structure dinucleotide from an mRNA. This activity is targeted preferentially towards mRNAs with unmethylated caps in contrast to the canonical decapping enzyme, Dcp2, which targets mRNAs with a methylated cap. Capped but unmethylated mRNAs generated in yeast cells with a defect in the methyltransferase gene are more stable in a rai1-gene-disrupted background. Moreover, rai1 Delta yeast cells with wild-type capping enzymes show significant accumulation of mRNAs with 5'-end capping defects under nutritional stress conditions of glucose starvation or amino acid starvation. These findings provide evidence that 5'-end capping is not a constitutive process that necessarily always proceeds to completion and demonstrates that Rai1 has an essential role in clearing mRNAs with aberrant 5'-end caps. We propose that Rai1 is involved in an as yet uncharacterized quality control process that ensures mRNA 5'-end integrity by an aberrant-cap-mediated mRNA decay mechanism.","[Jiao, Xinfu; Oh, ChanSeok; Martin, Charles E.; Kiledjian, Megerditch] Rutgers State Univ, Dept Cell Biol & Neurosci, Piscataway, NJ 08854 USA; [Xiang, Song; Tong, Liang] Columbia Univ, Dept Biol Sci, New York, NY 10027 USA","Kiledjian, M (reprint author), Rutgers State Univ, Dept Cell Biol & Neurosci, Piscataway, NJ 08854 USA.",kiledjian@biology.rutgers.edu,,"Tong, Liang/0000-0002-0563-6468; xiang (Xiang), song (Song)/0000-0001-9314-4684","National Institutes of Health (NIH) [GM077175, GM67005]",We thank B.

The mechanisms by which the two enzymes recognize their substrate tRNA(s), and how they cooperate with each other in Gln-tRNA(Gln) synthesis, remain to be determined. Here we report the formation of the 'glutamine transamidosome' from the bacterium Thermotoga maritima, consisting of tRNA(Gln), GluRS and the heterotrimeric amidotransferase GatCAB, and its crystal structure at 3.35 angstrom resolution. The anticodon-binding body of GluRS recognizes the common features of tRNA(Gln) and tRNA(Glu), whereas the tail body of GatCAB recognizes the outer corner of the L-shaped tRNA(Gln) in a tRNA(Gln)-specific manner. GluRS is in the productive form, as its catalytic body binds to the amino-acid-acceptor arm of tRNA(Gln). In contrast, GatCAB is in the non-productive form: the catalytic body of GatCAB contacts that of GluRS and is located near the acceptor stem of tRNA(Gln), in an appropriate site to wait for the completion of Glu-tRNA(Gln) formation by GluRS. We identified the hinges between the catalytic and anticodon-binding bodies of GluRS and between the catalytic and tail bodies of GatCAB, which allow both GluRS and GatCAB to adopt the productive and non-productive forms. The catalytic bodies of the two enzymes compete for the acceptor arm of tRNA(Gln) and therefore cannot assume their productive forms simultaneously. The transition from the present glutamylation state, with the productive GluRS and the non-productive GatCAB, to the putative amidation state, with the nonproductive GluRS and the productive GatCAB, requires an intermediate state with the two enzymes in their non-productive forms, for steric reasons. The proposed mechanism explains how the transamidosome efficiently performs the two consecutive steps of Gln-tRNA(Gln) formation, with a low risk of releasing the unstable intermediate Glu-tRNA(Gln).","[Ito, Takuhiro; Yokoyama, Shigeyuki] Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Sci, Dept Biochem & Biophys, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo 1130033, Japan; [Ito, Takuhiro; Yokoyama, Shigeyuki] Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Sci, Struct Biol Lab, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo 1130033, Japan; [Ito, Takuhiro; Yokoyama, Shigeyuki] RIKEN Syst & Struct Biol Ctr, Tsurumi Ku, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2300045, Japan","Yokoyama, S (reprint author), Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Sci, Dept Biochem & Biophys, Bunkyo Ku, 7-3-1 Hongo, Tokyo 1130033, Japan.",yokoyama@biochem.s.u-tokyo.ac.jp,"Ito, Takuhiro/N-6893-2015; Yokoyama, Shigeyuki/N-6911-2015","Yokoyama, Shigeyuki/0000-0003-3133-7338","Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology of Japan (MEXT); Japan Society for the Promotion of Science","We thank S.

To proceed, they require an initially symmetric cell to polarize(1). In Caenorhabditis elegans zygotes, anteroposterior polarization is facilitated by a large-scale flow of the actomyosin cortex(2-4), which directs the asymmetry of the first mitotic division. Cortical flows appear in many contexts of development(5), but their underlying forces and physical principles remain poorly understood. How actomyosin contractility and cortical tension interact to generate large-scale flow is unclear. Here we report on the subcellular distribution of cortical tension in the polarizing C. elegans zygote, which we determined using position- and direction-sensitive laser ablation. We demonstrate that cortical flow is associated with anisotropies in cortical tension and is not driven by gradients in cortical tension, which contradicts previous proposals(5). These experiments, in conjunction with a theoretical description of active cortical mechanics, identify two prerequisites for large-scale cortical flow: a gradient in actomyosin contractility to drive flow and a sufficiently large viscosity of the cortex to allow flow to be long-ranged. We thus reveal the physical requirements of large-scale intracellular cortical flow that ensure the efficient polarization of the C. elegans zygote.","[Mayer, Mirjam; Depken, Martin; Bois, Justin S.; Grill, Stephan W.] Max Planck Inst Mol Cell Biol & Genet, D-01307 Dresden, Germany; [Mayer, Mirjam; Depken, Martin; Bois, Justin S.; Juelicher, Frank; Grill, Stephan W.] Max Planck Inst Phys Komplexer Syst, D-01187 Dresden, Germany","Grill, SW (reprint author), Max Planck Inst Mol Cell Biol & Genet, D-01307 Dresden, Germany.",grill@mpi-cbg.de,"Julicher, Frank/B-1828-2009; Grill, Stephan /D-9427-2012","Julicher, Frank/0000-0003-4731-9185; Bois, Justin/0000-0001-7137-8746",Boehringer Ingelheim Fonds; Human Frontier Science Program,"We thank C.

Recent studies of seismic-wave receiver function data have detected a structural boundary under continental cratons at depths too shallow to be consistent with the lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary, as inferred from seismic tomography and other geophysical studies. Here we show that changes in the direction of azimuthal anisotropy with depth reveal the presence of two distinct lithospheric layers throughout the stable part of the North American continent. The top layer is thick (similar to 150 km) under the Archaean core and tapers out on the surrounding Palaeozoic borders. Its thickness variations follow those of a highly depleted layer inferred from thermo-barometric analysis of xenoliths. The lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary is relatively flat (ranging from 180 to 240 km in depth), in agreement with the presence of a thermal conductive root that subsequently formed around the depleted chemical layer. Our findings tie together seismological, geochemical and geodynamical studies of the cratonic lithosphere in North America. They also suggest that the horizon detected in receiver function studies probably corresponds to the sharp mid-lithospheric boundary rather than to the more gradual lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary.","[Yuan, Huaiyu; Romanowicz, Barbara] Berkeley Seismol Lab, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA","Romanowicz, B (reprint author), Berkeley Seismol Lab, 209 McCone Hall, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",barbara.romanowicz@gmail.com,"Yuan, Huaiyu/E-4231-2010; Romanowicz, barbara/H-6726-2017","Romanowicz, barbara/0000-0002-6208-6044; Yuan, Huaiyu/0000-0003-3512-7856",National Science Foundation,"We thank the IRIS Data Management Center, the Geological Survey of Canada and the Northern California Earthquake Data Center for providing the waveform data used in this study.

Here we show that ataxin 2 (ATXN2), a polyglutamine (polyQ) protein mutated in spinocerebellar ataxia type 2, is a potent modifier of TDP-43 toxicity in animal and cellular models. ATXN2 and TDP-43 associate in a complex that depends on RNA. In spinal cord neurons of ALS patients, ATXN2 is abnormally localized; likewise, TDP-43 shows mislocalization in spinocerebellar ataxia type 2. To assess the involvement of ATXN2 in ALS, we analysed the length of the polyQ repeat in the ATXN2 gene in 915 ALS patients. We found that intermediate-length polyQ expansions (27-33 glutamines) in ATXN2 were significantly associated with ALS. These data establish ATXN2 as a relatively common ALS susceptibility gene. Furthermore, these findings indicate that the TDP-43-ATXN2 interaction may be a promising target for therapeutic intervention in ALS and other TDP-43 proteinopathies.","[Elden, Andrew C.; Hart, Michael P.; Johnson, Brian S.; Fang, Xiaodong; Armakola, Maria; Lu, Min Min; Padmanabhan, Arun; Gitler, Aaron D.] Univ Penn, Dept Cell & Dev Biol, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Kim, Hyung-Jun; Bonini, Nancy M.] Univ Penn, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Dept Biol, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Chen-Plotkin, Alice S.; Geser, Felix; Greene, Robert; Clay-Falcone, Dana; Trojanowski, John Q.; Lee, Virginia M. -Y.; Van Deerlin, Vivianna M.] Univ Penn, Dept Pathol & Lab Med, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Chen-Plotkin, Alice S.; Geser, Felix; Greene, Robert; Clay-Falcone, Dana; Trojanowski, John Q.; Lee, Virginia M. -Y.; Van Deerlin, Vivianna M.] Univ Penn, Ctr Neurodegenerat Dis Res, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Chen-Plotkin, Alice S.; McCluskey, Leo; Elman, Lauren] Univ Penn, Dept Neurol, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Juhr, Denise; Gruber, Peter J.] Childrens Hosp Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Rueb, Udo] Goethe Univ Frankfurt, Inst Clin Neuroanat, D-60590 Frankfurt, Germany; [Auburger, Georg] Goethe Univ Frankfurt, Dept Neurol, D-60528 Frankfurt, Germany","Gitler, AD (reprint author), Univ Penn, Dept Cell & Dev Biol, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",nbonini@sas.upenn.edu; gitler@mail.med.upenn.edu,,"Johnson, Brian/0000-0003-3711-5920","University of Pennsylvania Institute on Aging; NIH [1DP2OD004417-01, 1R01NS065317-01, P01 AG-09215, AG-10124, AG-17586, K08 AG-033101-01]; Pew Charitable Trusts; Burroughs Wellcome Fund; Howard Hughes Medical Institute; Deutsche Heredo-Ataxie Gesellschaft (DHAG); Autosomal Dominant Cerebellar Ataxia (ADCA) Vereniging Nederland; Spinocerebellar Ataxias (EuroSCA); Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) [AU96/11-1]","This work was supported in part by a Pilot grant from the University of Pennsylvania Institute on Aging (A.D.G.), an NIH Director's New Innovator Award 1DP2OD004417-01 (A.D.G.), 1R01NS065317-01 (A.D.G.), P01 AG-09215 (N.M.B.), AG-10124 (J.Q.T., V.M.V.D.) and AG-17586, (V.M.-Y.L., V.M.V.D.).

During adenovirus replication, the degradation of p53 by E1B-55k is considered essential for p53 inactivation, and is the basis for p53-selective viral cancer therapies. Here we reveal a dominant epigenetic mechanism that silences p53-activated transcription, irrespective of p53 phosphorylation and stabilization. We show that another adenoviral protein, E4-ORF3, inactivates p53 independently of E1B-55k by forming a nuclear structure that induces de novo H3K9me3 heterochromatin formation at p53 target promoters, preventing p53-DNA binding. This suppressive nuclear web is highly selective in silencing p53 promoters and operates in the backdrop of global transcriptional changes that drive oncogenic replication. These findings are important for understanding how high levels of wild-type p53 might also be inactivated in cancer as well as the mechanisms that induce aberrant epigenetic silencing of tumour-suppressor loci. Our study changes the longstanding definition of how p53 is inactivated in adenovirus infection and provides key insights that could enable the development of true p53-selective oncolytic viral therapies.","[Soria, Conrado; Estermann, Fanny E.; Espantman, Kristen C.; O'Shea, Clodagh C.] Salk Inst Biol Studies, Mol & Cell Biol Lab, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA","O'Shea, CC (reprint author), Salk Inst Biol Studies, Mol & Cell Biol Lab, 10010 N Torrey Pines Rd, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA.",oshea@salk.edu,,,Alliance of Cancer Gene Therapy; American Cancer Society; Sontag Foundation; Beckman Foundation; National Cancer Institute [R01CA137094],"We thank J.

Models in which the 'seeds' of such black holes form by the collapse of primordial metal-free stars(2,3) cannot explain the rapid appearance of these supermassive black holes because gas accretion is not sufficiently efficient(4-6). Alternatively, these black holes may form by direct collapse of gas within isolated protogalaxies(7,8), but current models require idealized conditions, such as metal-free gas, to prevent cooling and star formation from consuming the gas reservoir(9-11). Here we report simulations showing that mergers between massive protogalaxies naturally produce the conditions for direct collapse into a supermassive black hole with no need to suppress cooling and star formation. Merger-driven gas inflows give rise to an unstable, massive nuclear gas disk of a few billion solar masses, which funnels more than 10(8) solar masses of gas to a sub-parsec-scale gas cloud in only 100,000 years. The cloud undergoes gravitational collapse, which eventually leads to the formation of a massive black hole. The black hole can subsequently grow to a billion solar masses on timescales of about 10(8) years by accreting gas from the surrounding disk.","[Mayer, L.; Callegari, S.] Univ Zurich, Inst Theoret Phys, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland; [Kazantzidis, S.] Ohio State Univ, Ctr Cosmol & Astroparticle Phys, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Kazantzidis, S.] Ohio State Univ, Dept Phys, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Kazantzidis, S.] Ohio State Univ, Dept Astron, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Escala, A.] Univ Chile, Dept Astron, Santiago 7550000, Chile; [Escala, A.] Stanford Univ, KIPAC, Menlo Pk, CA 94025 USA","Mayer, L (reprint author), Univ Zurich, Inst Theoret Phys, 190 Winterthurestr, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland.",lmayer@physik.unizh.ch,"Escala, Andres /J-6618-2016",,Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF); Center for Cosmology and Astro Particle Physics (CCAPP) at Ohio State University; Kavli Institute for Particle Astrophysics (KIPAC) at Stanford University,"We thank M.

Backward integrations of their orbits indicated that they separated gently with low relative velocities, but did not provide additional insight into their formation mechanism. A previously hypothesized rotational fission process 4 may explain their formation-critical predictions are that the mass ratios are less than about 0.2 and, as the mass ratio approaches this upper limit, the spin period of the larger body becomes long. Here we report photometric observations of a sample of asteroid pairs, revealing that the primaries of pairs with mass ratios much less than 0.2 rotate rapidly, near their critical fission frequency. As the mass ratio approaches 0.2, the primary period grows long. This occurs as the total energy of the system approaches zero, requiring the asteroid pair to extract an increasing fraction of energy from the primary's spin in order to escape. We do not find asteroid pairs with mass ratios larger than 0.2. Rotationally fissioned systems beyond this limit have insufficient energy to disrupt. We conclude that asteroid pairs are formed by the rotational fission of a parent asteroid into a proto-binary system, which subsequently disrupts under its own internal system dynamics soon after formation.","[Pravec, P.; Galad, A.; Kusnirak, P.; Henych, T.] Astron Inst AS CR, CZ-25165 Ondrejov, Czech Republic; [Vokrouhlicky, D.] Charles Univ Prague, Inst Astron, CZ-18000 Prague, Czech Republic; [Polishook, D.] Tel Aviv Univ, Wise Observ, IL-69978 Tel Aviv, Israel; [Polishook, D.] Tel Aviv Univ, Dept Geophys & Planetary Phys, IL-69978 Tel Aviv, Israel; [Scheeres, D.

The exciton states formed from correlated electron-hole pairs have been studied extensively(1,2), but basic properties of multiple-exciton correlations-such as coherence times, population lifetimes, binding energies and the number of particles that can be correlated-are largely unknown because they are not spectroscopically accessible from the ground state. Here we present direct observations of high-order coherences in gallium arsenide quantum wells, achieved using two-dimensional multiple-quantum spectroscopy methods in which up to seven successive light fields were used. The measurements were made possible by the combination of a reconfigurable spatial beam-shaper that formed multiple beams in specified geometries and a spatiotemporal pulse-shaper that controlled the relative optical phases and temporal delays among pulses in all the beams. The results reveal triexciton coherences (correlations of three excitons or six particles), whose existence was not obvious because the third exciton spin is unpaired, and the values of their coherence times and binding energies. Rephasing of biexcitons, triexcitons and unbound two-exciton coherences was demonstrated. We also determined that there are no significant unbound correlations of three excitons and no bound or unbound four-exciton (eight-particle) correlations. Thus, the limits, as well as the properties, of many-body correlations in this system were revealed. The measurement methods open a new window into high-order many-body interactions in materials and molecules(3), and the present results should guide ongoing work on first-principles calculations of electronic interactions in semiconductor nanostructures(4).","[Turner, Daniel B.; Nelson, Keith A.] MIT, Dept Chem, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA","Nelson, KA (reprint author), MIT, Dept Chem, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",kanelson@mit.edu,,,National Defense Science and Engineering; National Science Foundation [CHE-0616939],D.B.T. was supported by the National Defense Science and Engineering Graduate Fellowship programme and the National Science Foundation Graduate Fellowship programme and wishes to thank M.

During the last glaciation, lower atmospheric CO(2) levels were accompanied by increased atmospheric radiocarbon concentrations that have been attributed to greater storage of CO(2) in a poorly ventilated abyssal ocean(1,2). The end of the ice age was marked by a rapid increase in atmospheric CO(2) concentrations(2) that coincided with reduced (14)C/(12)C ratios (Delta(14)C) in the atmosphere(3), suggesting the release of very 'old' ((14)C-depleted) CO(2) from the deep ocean to the atmosphere(3). Here we present radiocarbon records of surface and intermediate-depth waters from two sediment cores in the southwest Pacific and Southern oceans. We find a steady 170 per mil decrease in Delta(14)C that precedes and roughly equals in magnitude the decrease in the atmospheric radiocarbon signal during the early stages of the glacial-interglacial climatic transition. The atmospheric decrease in the radiocarbon signal coincides with regionally intensified upwelling and marine biological productivity(4), suggesting that CO(2) released by means of deep water upwelling in the Southern Ocean lost most of its original depleted-(14)C imprint as a result of exchange and isotopic equilibration with the atmosphere. Our data imply that the deglacial (14)C depletion previously identified in the eastern tropical North Pacific(5) must have involved contributions from sources other than the previously suggested carbon release by way of a deep Southern Ocean pathway(5), and may reflect the expanded influence of the (14)C-depleted North Pacific carbon reservoir across this interval. Accordingly, shallow water masses advecting north across the South Pacific in the early deglaciation had little or no residual (14)C-depleted signals owing to degassing of CO(2) and biological uptake in the Southern Ocean.","[Sikes, Elisabeth L.] Rutgers State Univ, Inst Marine & Coastal Sci, New Brunswick, NJ 08901 USA; [Rose, Kathryn A.; Hill, Tessa M.; Spero, Howard J.] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Geol, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Guilderson, Thomas P.] Lawrence Livermore Natl Lab, Livermore, CA 94550 USA; [Guilderson, Thomas P.] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Inst Marine Sci, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA; [Shane, Phil] Univ Auckland, Sch Environm, Auckland 1142, New Zealand; [Zahn, Rainer] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Inst Ciencia & Tecnol Ambientals, Dept Geol, Inst Catalana Recerca & Estudis Avancats,ICREA, Bellaterra 08193, Spain","Sikes, EL (reprint author), Rutgers State Univ, Inst Marine & Coastal Sci, 71 Dudley Rd, New Brunswick, NJ 08901 USA.",sikes@marine.rutgers.edu,,"Shane, Philip/0000-0002-7824-1184; Hill, Tessa/0000-0003-4159-9104; Spero, Howard/0000-0001-5465-8607","National Science Foundation (NSF) [RR0503]; Evolving Earth Foundation; Geological Society of America; MICINN, Spain; US Department of Energy; ICREA","We thank the captain and crew of the RV Revelle, and our shipboard colleagues during the Zheng leg 3 (RR0503) cruise funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF), which collected the RR core.

Anthropogenic impacts and the need for systematic conservation planning have further motivated the analysis of diversity patterns and processes at regional to global scales(3). Whereas land diversity patterns and their predictors are known for numerous taxa(4,5), our understanding of global marine diversity has been more limited, with recent findings revealing some striking contrasts to widely held terrestrial paradigms(6-8). Here we examine global patterns and predictors of species richness across 13 major species groups ranging from zooplankton to marine mammals. Two major patterns emerged: coastal species showed maximum diversity in the Western Pacific, whereas oceanic groups consistently peaked across broad mid-latitudinal bands in all oceans. Spatial regression analyses revealed sea surface temperature as the only environmental predictor highly related to diversity across all 13 taxa. Habitat availability and historical factors were also important for coastal species, whereas other predictors had less significance. Areas of high species richness were disproportionately concentrated in regions with medium or higher human impacts. Our findings indicate a fundamental role of temperature or kinetic energy in structuring cross-taxon marine biodiversity, and indicate that changes in ocean temperature, in conjunction with other human impacts, may ultimately rearrange the global distribution of life in the ocean.","[Tittensor, Derek P.; Mora, Camilo; Lotze, Heike K.; Ricard, Daniel; Worm, Boris] Dalhousie Univ, Dept Biol, Halifax, NS B3H 4J1, Canada; [Jetz, Walter] Yale Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Vanden Berghe, Edward] Rutgers State Univ, Inst Marine & Coastal Sci, New Brunswick, NJ 08901 USA","Tittensor, DP (reprint author), Dalhousie Univ, Dept Biol, 1355 Oxford St, Halifax, NS B3H 4J1, Canada.",derekt@mathstat.dal.ca,"Ricard, Daniel/G-1814-2014",,"Sloan Foundation; NSF [DBI-0960550, BCS-0648733]","We acknowledge contributions and sharing of data from L.

J,"Wood, SN",,,,"Wood, Simon N.",,,Statistical inference for noisy nonlinear ecological dynamic systems,NATURE,,,English,Article,,,,,,,POPULATIONS; MODELS,"Chaotic ecological dynamic systems defy conventional statistical analysis. Systems with near-chaotic dynamics are little better. Such systems are almost invariably driven by endogenous dynamic processes plus demographic and environmental process noise, and are only observable with error. Their sensitivity to history means that minute changes in the driving noise realization, or the system parameters, will cause drastic changes in the system trajectory(1). This sensitivity is inherited and amplified by the joint probability density of the observable data and the process noise, rendering it useless as the basis for obtaining measures of statistical fit. Because the joint density is the basis for the fit measures used by all conventional statistical methods(2), this is a major theoretical shortcoming. The inability to make well-founded statistical inferences about biological dynamic models in the chaotic and near-chaotic regimes, other than on an ad hoc basis, leaves dynamic theory without the methods of quantitative validation that are essential tools in the rest of biological science. Here I show that this impasse can be resolved in a simple and general manner, using a method that requires only the ability to simulate the observed data on a system from the dynamic model about which inferences are required. The raw data series are reduced to phase-insensitive summary statistics, quantifying local dynamic structure and the distribution of observations. Simulation is used to obtain the mean and the covariance matrix of the statistics, given model parameters, allowing the construction of a 'synthetic likelihood' that assesses model fit. This likelihood can be explored using a straightforward Markov chain Monte Carlo sampler, but one further post-processing step returns pure likelihood-based inference. I apply the method to establish the dynamic nature of the fluctuations in Nicholson's classic blowfly experiments(3-5).","Univ Bath, Bath BA2 7AY, Avon, England","Wood, SN (reprint author), Univ Bath, Bath BA2 7AY, Avon, England.",s.wood@bath.ac.uk,"Wood, Simon/B-3058-2010","Wood, Simon/0000-0002-2034-7453",EPSRC/NERC,"I am grateful to W.

Its mammalian homologue, SIRT1, seems to have evolved complex systemic roles in cardiac function, DNA repair and genomic stability. Recent studies suggest a functional relevance of SIRT1 in normal brain physiology and neurological disorders. However, it is unknown if SIRT1 has a role in higher-order brain functions. We report that SIRT1 modulates synaptic plasticity and memory formation via a microRNA-mediated mechanism. Activation of SIRT1 enhances, whereas its loss-of-function impairs, synaptic plasticity. Surprisingly, these effects were mediated via post-transcriptional regulation of cAMP response binding protein (CREB) expression by a brain-specific microRNA, miR-134. SIRT1 normally functions to limit expression of miR-134 via a repressor complex containing the transcription factor YY1, and unchecked miR-134 expression following SIRT1 deficiency results in the downregulated expression of CREB and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), thereby impairing synaptic plasticity. These findings demonstrate a new role for SIRT1 in cognition and a previously unknown microRNA-based mechanism by which SIRT1 regulates these processes. Furthermore, these results describe a separate branch of SIRT1 signalling, in which SIRT1 has a direct role in regulating normal brain function in a manner that is disparate from its cell survival functions, demonstrating its value as a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of central nervous system disorders.","[Gao, Jun; Wang, Wen-Yuan; Mao, Ying-Wei; Graeff, Johannes; Guan, Ji-Song; Pan, Ling; Mak, Gloria; Kim, Dohoon; Su, Susan C.; Tsai, Li-Huei] MIT, Dept Brain & Cognit Sci, Picower Inst Learning & Memory, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Gao, Jun; Wang, Wen-Yuan; Mao, Ying-Wei; Guan, Ji-Song; Pan, Ling; Mak, Gloria; Kim, Dohoon; Su, Susan C.; Tsai, Li-Huei] MIT, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Gao, Jun] Nanjing Univ, MOE Key Lab Model Anim Dis Study, Model Anim Res Ctr, Nanjing 210061, Peoples R China; [Graeff, Johannes; Tsai, Li-Huei] Broad Inst, Stanley Ctr Psychiat Res, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA","Tsai, LH (reprint author), MIT, Dept Brain & Cognit Sci, Picower Inst Learning & Memory, E25-618, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",lhtsai@mit.edu,"wang, wenyuan /F-7218-2011; Pan, Ling/K-9333-2013","Pan, Ling/0000-0001-9947-9071; Graff, Johannes/0000-0002-3219-3578; Guan, Ji-Song /0000-0001-5219-0289",NIH [PO1 AG027916]; Simons Foundation; Swiss National Science Foundation; Howard Hughes Medical Institute,"We thank R.

Numerous functions have been ascribed to the product of the human RB1 gene, the retinoblastoma protein (pRb). The best known is pRb's ability to promote cell-cycle exit through inhibition of the E2F transcription factors and the transcriptional repression of genes encoding cell-cycle regulators(1). In addition, pRb has been shown in vitro to regulate several transcription factors that are master differentiation inducers(2). Depending on the differentiation factor and cellular context, pRb can either suppress or promote their transcriptional activity. For example, pRb binds to Runx2 and potentiates its ability to promote osteogenic differentiation in vitro(3). In contrast, pRb acts with E2F to suppress peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma subunit (PPAR-gamma), the master activator of adipogenesis(4,5). Because osteoblasts and adipocytes can both arise from mesenchymal stem cells, these observations suggest that pRb might play a role in the choice between these two fates. However, so far, there is no evidence for this in vivo. Here we use mouse models to address this hypothesis in mesenchymal tissue development and tumorigenesis. Our data show that Rb status plays a key role in establishing fate choice between bone and brown adipose tissue in vivo.","[Calo, Eliezer; Quintero-Estades, Jose A.; Danielian, Paul S.; Nedelcu, Simona; Berman, Seth D.; Lees, Jacqueline A.] MIT, David H Koch Inst Integrat Canc Res, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA","Lees, JA (reprint author), MIT, David H Koch Inst Integrat Canc Res, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",jalees@mit.edu,,,National Cancer Institute/National Institutes of Health,"We thank T.

I kappa B beta, a major isoform of I kappa B, can sequester NF-kappa B in the cytoplasm(2), although its biological role remains unclear. Although cells lacking IkBb have been reported(3,4), in vivo studies have been limited and suggested redundancy between I kappa B alpha and I kappa B beta(5). Like I kappa B alpha, I kappa B beta is also inducibly degraded; however, upon stimulation by lipopolysaccharide (LPS), it is degraded slowly and re-synthesized as a hypophosphorylated form that can be detected in the nucleus(6-11). The crystal structure of I kappa B beta bound to p65 suggested this complex might bind DNA(12). In vitro, hypophosphorylated I kappa B beta can bind DNA with p65 and c-Rel, and the DNA-bound NF-kappa B:I kappa B beta complexes are resistant to I kappa B alpha, suggesting hypophosphorylated, nuclear I kappa B beta may prolong the expression of certain genes(9-11). Here we report that in vivo I kappa B beta serves both to inhibit and facilitate the inflammatory response. I kappa B beta degradation releases NF-kappa B dimers which upregulate proinflammatory target genes such as tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha). Surprisingly, absence of I kappa B beta results in a dramatic reduction of TNF-alpha in response to LPS even though activation of NF-kappa B is normal. The inhibition of TNF-alpha messenger RNA (mRNA) expression correlates with the absence of nuclear, hypophosphorylated-I kappa B beta bound to p65:c-Rel heterodimers at a specific kappa B site on the TNF-alpha promoter. Therefore I kappa B beta acts through p65:c-Rel dimers to maintain prolonged expression of TNF-alpha. As a result, I kappa B beta(-/-) mice are resistant to LPS-induced septic shock and collagen-induced arthritis. Blocking I kappa B beta might be a promising new strategy for selectively inhibiting the chronic phase of TNF-alpha production during the inflammatory response.","[Rao, Ping; Hayden, Mathew S.; Long, Meixiao; West, A.

During targeting through the cytosol, the hydrophobic TMD of these tail-anchored (TA) proteins requires constant chaperoning to prevent aggregation or inappropriate interactions. A central component of this targeting system is TRC40, a conserved cytosolic factor that recognizes the TMD of TA proteins and delivers them to the ER for insertion(2-4). The mechanism that permits TRC40 to find and capture its TA protein cargos effectively in a highly crowded cytosol is unknown. Here we identify a conserved three-protein complex composed of Bat3, TRC35 and Ubl4A that facilitates TA protein capture by TRC40. This Bat3 complex is recruited to ribosomes synthesizing membrane proteins, interacts with the TMDs of newly released TA proteins, and transfers them to TRC40 for targeting. Depletion of the Bat3 complex allows non-TRC40 factors to compete for TA proteins, explaining their mislocalization in the analogous yeast deletion strains(5-7). Thus, the Bat3 complex acts as a TMD-selective chaperone that effectively channels TA proteins to the TRC40 insertion pathway.","[Mariappan, Malaiyalam; Li, Xingzhe; Stefanovic, Sandra; Sharma, Ajay; Hegde, Ramanujan S.] NICHHD, Cell Biol & Metab Program, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Li, Xingzhe] Peking Univ, Sch Basic Med Sci, Beijing 100191, Peoples R China; [Mateja, Agnieszka; Keenan, Robert J.] Univ Chicago, Dept Biochem & Mol Biol, Chicago, IL 60637 USA","Hegde, RS (reprint author), NICHHD, Cell Biol & Metab Program, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA.",hegder@mail.nih.gov,"mariappan, malaiyalam/K-9024-2012","Hegde, Ramanujan/0000-0001-8338-852X",National Institutes of Health; Edward Mallinckrodt Jr Foundation,"We thank S.

Several other bacterial and eukaryotic proteins have since been shown to be alpha-N-methylated(3-10). However, the Ran guanine nucleotide-exchange factor, RCC1, is the only protein for which any biological function of alpha-N-methylation has been identified(3,11). Methylation-defective mutants of RCC1 have reduced affinity for DNA and cause mitotic defects(3,11), but further characterization of this modification has been hindered by ignorance of the responsible methyltransferase. All fungal and animal N-terminally methylated proteins contain a unique N-terminal motif, Met-(Ala/Pro/Ser)Pro-Lys, indicating that they may be targets of the same, unknown enzyme(3,12). The initiating Met is cleaved, and the exposed alpha-amino group is mono-, di- or trimethylated. Here we report the discovery of the first alpha-N-methyltransferase, which we named N-terminal RCC1 methyltransferase (NRMT). Substrate docking and mutational analysis of RCC1 defined the NRMT recognition sequence and enabled the identification of numerous new methylation targets, including SET (also known as TAF-I or PHAPII) and the retinoblastoma protein, RB. Knockdown of NRMT recapitulates the multi-spindle phenotype seen with methylation-defective RCC1 mutants(3), demonstrating the importance of alpha-N-methylation for normal bipolar spindle formation and chromosome segregation.","[Tooley, Christine E.

Although the enzymes that catalyse DNA methylation have been characterized, enzymes responsible for demethylation have been elusive(5). A recent study indicates that the human TET1 protein could catalyse the conversion of 5-methylcytosine (5mC) of DNA to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC), raising the possibility that DNA demethylation may be a Tet1-mediated process(6). Here we extend this study by demonstrating that all three mouse Tet proteins (Tet1, Tet2 and Tet3) can also catalyse a similar reaction. Tet1 has an important role in mouse embryonic stem (ES) cell maintenance through maintaining the expression of Nanog in ES cells. Downregulation of Nanog via Tet1 knockdown correlates with methylation of the Nanog promoter, supporting a role for Tet1 in regulating DNA methylation status. Furthermore, knockdown of Tet1 in pre-implantation embryos results in a bias towards trophectoderm differentiation. Thus, our studies not only uncover the enzymatic activity of the Tet proteins, but also demonstrate a role for Tet1 in ES cell maintenance and inner cell mass cell specification.","[Ito, Shinsuke; D'Alessio, Ana C.; Taranova, Olena V.; Hong, Kwonho; Zhang, Yi] Univ N Carolina, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA; [Ito, Shinsuke; D'Alessio, Ana C.; Taranova, Olena V.; Hong, Kwonho; Zhang, Yi] Univ N Carolina, Dept Biochem & Biophys, Lineberger Comprehens Canc Ctr, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA; [Sowers, Lawrence C.] Loma Linda Univ, Sch Med, Dept Basic Sci, Loma Linda, CA 92350 USA","Zhang, Y (reprint author), Univ N Carolina, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA.",yi_zhang@med.unc.edu,"jia, xu/A-8386-2016",,"NIH [GM68804, CA084487]",We thank M.

Type IIA topoisomerases cleave and religate DNA to regulate DNA topology and are a major class of antibacterial and anticancer drug targets, yet there is no well developed structural basis for understanding drug action. Here we report the 2.1 angstrom crystal structure of a potent, new class, broad-spectrum antibacterial agent in complex with Staphylococcus aureus DNA gyrase and DNA, showing a new mode of inhibition that circumvents fluoroquinolone resistance in this clinically important drug target. The inhibitor 'bridges' the DNA and a transient non-catalytic pocket on the two-fold axis at the GyrA dimer interface, and is close to the active sites and fluoroquinolone binding sites. In the inhibitor complex the active site seems poised to cleave the DNA, with a single metal ion observed between the TOPRIM (topoisomerase/primase) domain and the scissile phosphate. This work provides new insights into the mechanism of topoisomerase action and a platform for structure-based drug design of a new class of antibacterial agents against a clinically proven, but conformationally flexible, enzyme class.","[Bax, Benjamin D.; Hann, Michael M.; Saunders, Martin R.; Singh, Onkar; Spitzfaden, Claus E.] GlaxoSmithKline Inc, Med Res Ctr, Mol Discovery Res, Stevenage SG1 2NY, Herts, England; [Chan, Pan F.; Gentry, Daniel R.; Huang, Jianzhong; May, Earl W.; Shen, Carol; Pearson, Neil D.; Gwynn, Michael N.] GlaxoSmithKline Inc, Infect Dis Ctr Excellence Drug Discovery, Antibacterial Discovery Performance Unit, Collegeville, PA 19426 USA; [Eggleston, Drake S.; Fosberry, Andrew; Gorrec, Fabrice; Hibbs, Martin; Jones, Emma; Jones, Jo; Lewis, Ceri J.; Shillings, Anthony; Theobald, Andrew J.] GlaxoSmithKline Inc, Mol Discovery Res, Harlow CM19 5AW, Essex, England; [Giordano, Ilaria; Hennessy, Alan; Wohlkonig, Alexandre] GlaxoSmithKline Inc, Med Res Ctr, Antibacterial Discovery Performance Unit, Stevenage SG1 2NY, Herts, England; [Brown, Kristin Koretke] GlaxoSmithKline Inc, Mol Discovery Res, Collegeville, PA 19426 USA","Bax, BD (reprint author), GlaxoSmithKline Inc, Med Res Ctr, Mol Discovery Res, Gunnels Wood Rd, Stevenage SG1 2NY, Herts, England.",benjamin.d.bax@gsk.com; mick.gwynn@gsk.com,,"Bax, Ben/0000-0003-1940-3785",Wellcome Trust Seeding Drug Discovery Initiative; US Department of Defense (DoD) [HDTRA1-07-9-0002]; Joint Science and Technology Office for Chemical and Biological Defense (JSTO-CBD) [HDTRA1-07-9-0002]; Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA); Transformational Medical Technologies (TMT),"We thank H.

These lesions also contribute to the efficacy of radiotherapy and many cancer chemotherapeutics. DSBs elicit a signalling cascade that modifies the chromatin surrounding the break, first by ATM-dependent phosphorylation and then by RNF8-, RNF168- and BRCA1-dependent regulatory ubiquitination. Here we report that OTUB1, a deubiquitinating enzyme, is an inhibitor of DSB-induced chromatin ubiquitination. Surprisingly, we found that OTUB1 suppresses RNF168-dependent poly-ubiquitination independently of its catalytic activity. OTUB1 does so by binding to and inhibiting UBC13 (also known as UBE2N), the cognate E2 enzyme for RNF168. This unusual mode of regulation is unlikely to be limited to UBC13 because analysis of OTUB1-associated proteins revealed that OTUB1 binds to E2s of the UBE2D and UBE2E subfamilies. Finally, OTUB1 depletion mitigates the DSB repair defect associated with defective ATM signalling, indicating that pharmacological targeting of the OTUB1-UBC13 interaction might enhance the DNA damage response.","[Panier, Stephanie; Al-Hakim, Abdallah; Juang, Yu-Chi; O'Donnell, Lara; Munro, Meagan; Sicheri, Frank; Gingras, Anne-Claude; Durocher, Daniel] Mt Sinai Hosp, Samuel Lunenfeld Res Inst, Toronto, ON M5G 1X5, Canada; [Nakada, Shinichiro; Tai, Ikue] Keio Univ, Sch Med, Ctr Integrated Med Res, Shinjuku Ku, Tokyo 1608582, Japan; [Nakada, Shinichiro; Tai, Ikue; Kumakubo, Ayako; Suda, Toshio] Keio Univ, Sch Med, Dept Cell Differentiat, Sakaguchi Lab Dev Biol,Shinjuku Ku, Tokyo 1608582, Japan; [Panier, Stephanie; Sicheri, Frank; Gingras, Anne-Claude; Durocher, Daniel] Univ Toronto, Dept Mol Genet, Toronto, ON M5S 1A8, Canada; [Iemura, Shun-ichiro; Natsume, Tohru] Natl Inst Adv Ind Sci & Technol, Biomed Informat Res Ctr, Biol Syst Control Team, Koto Ku, Tokyo 1350064, Japan","Durocher, D (reprint author), Mt Sinai Hosp, Samuel Lunenfeld Res Inst, 600 Univ Ave, Toronto, ON M5G 1X5, Canada.",snakada@z3.keio.jp; durocher@lunenfeld.ca,"Durocher, Daniel/A-7733-2010; Gingras, Anne-Claude/E-9982-2010; Sicheri, Frank/F-8856-2013; Suda, Toshio/H-6761-2013","Durocher, Daniel/0000-0003-3863-8635; Gingras, Anne-Claude/0000-0002-6090-4437; Suda, Toshio/0000-0001-7540-1771","Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT) Japan; MEXT [21870033]; Takeda Science Foundation; Mitsubishi Pharma Research Foundation; Daiwa Anglo-Japanese Foundation; New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization (NEDO); Boehringer Ingelheim Fonds; Canadian Institutes of Health Research [MOP10703115, MOP84314]","We are grateful to T.

The superconducting phase is often one of several competing types of electronic order, including antiferromagnetism and charge density waves(1-5). An emerging trend documented in heavy-fermion(1) and organic(2) conductors is that the maximum T-c for superconductivity occurs under external conditions that cause the critical temperature for a competing order to go to zero. Recently, such competition has been found in multilayer copper oxide high-temperature superconductors (HTSCs3-5) that possess two crystallographically inequivalent CuO2 planes in the unit cell. However, whether the competing electronic state can be suppressed to enhance T-c in HTSCs remains an open question. Here we show that pressure-driven phase competition leads to an unusual two-step enhancement of T-c in optimally doped trilayer Bi2Sr2Ca2Cu3O10+delta (Bi2223). We find that T-c first increases with pressure and then decreases after passing through a maximum. Unexpectedly, T-c increases again when the pressure is further raised above a critical value of around 24 GPa, surpassing the first maximum. The presence of this critical pressure is a manifestation of the crossover from the competing order to superconductivity in the inner of the three CuO2 planes. We suggest that the increase at higher pressures occurs as a result of competition between pairing and phase ordering in different CuO2 planes.","[Chen, Xiao-Jia; Struzhkin, Viktor V.; Yu, Yong; Goncharov, Alexander F.; Mao, Ho-kwang; Hemley, Russell J.] Carnegie Inst Sci, Geophys Lab, Washington, DC 20015 USA; [Chen, Xiao-Jia] S China Univ Technol, Dept Phys, Guangzhou 510640, Peoples R China; [Lin, Cheng-Tian] Max Planck Inst Festkorperforsch, D-70569 Stuttgart, Germany","Chen, XJ (reprint author), Carnegie Inst Sci, Geophys Lab, 5251 Broad Branch Rd NW, Washington, DC 20015 USA.",xjchen@ciw.edu; hmao@gl.ciw.edu; rhemley@gl.ciw.edu,"Struzhkin, Viktor/J-9847-2013","Struzhkin, Viktor/0000-0002-3468-0548","DOE [DE-SC0001057, DE-FG02-02ER45955, DEFC03-03NA00144]; Carnegie Canada; NSFC [10874046]","We thank M.

Furthermore, the properties of the few compounds that simultaneously exhibit these phenomena(1-5) are insignificant in comparison with those of useful ferroelectrics or ferromagnets: their spontaneous polarizations or magnetizations are smaller by a factor of 1,000 or more. The same holds for magnetic-or electric-field-induced multiferroics(6-8). Owing to the weak properties of single-phase multiferroics, composite and multilayer approaches involving strain-coupled piezoelectric and magnetostrictive components are the closest to application today(1,2). Recently, however, a new route to ferroelectric ferromagnets was proposed(9) by which magnetically ordered insulators that are neither ferroelectric nor ferromagnetic are transformed into ferroelectric ferromagnets using a single control parameter, strain. The system targeted, EuTiO(3), was predicted to exhibit strong ferromagnetism (spontaneous magnetization, similar to 7 Bohr magnetons per Eu) and strong ferroelectricity (spontaneous polarization, similar to 10 mu C cm(-2)) simultaneously under large biaxial compressive strain(9). These values are orders of magnitude higher than those of any known ferroelectric ferromagnet and rival the best materials that are solely ferroelectric or ferromagnetic. Hindered by the absence of an appropriate substrate to provide the desired compression we turned to tensile strain. Here we show both experimentally and theoretically the emergence of a multiferroic state under biaxial tension with the unexpected benefit that even lower strains are required, thereby allowing thicker high-quality crystalline films. This realization of a strong ferromagnetic ferroelectric points the way to high-temperature manifestations of this spin-lattice coupling mechanism(10). Our work demonstrates that a single experimental parameter, strain, simultaneously controls multiple order parameters and is a viable alternative tuning parameter to composition(11) for creating multiferroics.","[Lee, June Hyuk; Heeg, Tassilo; Schlom, Darrell G.] Cornell Univ, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Lee, June Hyuk; Vlahos, Eftihia; Gopalan, Venkatraman] Penn State Univ, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Fang, Lei; Jung, Young Woo; Hammel, P.

The tsunami that devastated the Samoan and northern Tongan islands on 29 September 2009 was preceded by a globally recorded magnitude-8 normal-faulting earthquake in the outer-rise region, where the Pacific plate bends before entering the subduction zone. Preliminary interpretation suggested that this earthquake was the source of the tsunami(3). Here we show that the outer-rise earthquake was accompanied by a nearly simultaneous rupture of the shallow subduction interface, equivalent to a magnitude-8 earthquake, that also contributed significantly to the tsunami. The subduction interface event was probably a slow earthquake with a rise time of several minutes that triggered the outer-rise event several minutes later. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that the normal fault ruptured first and dynamically triggered the subduction interface event. Our evidence comes from displacements of Global Positioning System stations and modelling of tsunami waves recorded by ocean-bottom pressure sensors, with support from seismic data and tsunami field observations. Evidence of the subduction earthquake in global seismic data is largely hidden because of the earthquake's slow rise time or because its ground motion is disguised by that of the normal-faulting event. Earthquake doublets where subduction interface events trigger large outer-rise earthquakes have been recorded previously(4), but this is the first well-documented example where the two events occur so closely in time and the triggering event might be a slow earthquake. As well as providing information on strain release mechanisms at subduction zones, earthquakes such as this provide a possible mechanism for the occasional large tsunamis generated at the Tonga subduction zone(5), where slip between the plates is predominantly aseismic(6).","[Beavan, J.; Wang, X.; Holden, C.; Wilson, K.; Power, W.; Prasetya, G.] GNS Sci, Lower Hutt 5040, New Zealand; [Bevis, M.] Ohio State Univ, Sch Earth Sci, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Kautoke, R.] Minist Lands Survey Nat Resources & Environm, Nukualofa, Tonga","Beavan, J (reprint author), GNS Sci, POB 30368, Lower Hutt 5040, New Zealand.",j.beavan@gns.cri.nz; x.wang@gns.cri.nz,"Wright, Dawn/A-4518-2011","Wright, Dawn/0000-0002-2997-7611",,,,29,61,61,0,15,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,19-Aug,2010,466,7309,,,,,959,U78,,10.1038/nature09292,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,640ED,WOS:000281030300031,20725037,No,,,11/20/17

Such interplate ruptures produce dynamic and static stress changes that can activate nearby intraplate aftershocks, as is commonly observed in the trench-slope region seaward of a great subduction zone thrust event(1-4). The earthquake sequence addressed here involves a rare instance in which a great trench-slope intraplate earthquake triggered extensive interplate faulting, reversing the typical pattern and broadly expanding the seismic and tsunami hazard. On 29 September 2009, within two minutes of the initiation of a normal faulting event with moment magnitude 8.1 in the outer trench-slope at the northern end of the Tonga subduction zone, two major interplate underthrusting subevents (both with moment magnitude 7.8), with total moment equal to a second great earthquake of moment magnitude 8.0, ruptured the nearby subduction zone megathrust. The collective faulting produced tsunami waves with localized regions of about 12 metres run-up that claimed 192 lives in Samoa, American Samoa and Tonga. Overlap of the seismic signals obscured the fact that distinct faults separated by more than 50km had ruptured with different geometries, with the triggered thrust faulting only being revealed by detailed seismic wave analyses.

However, in vertebrates, cooperation often occurs between non-relatives and promiscuity rates are among the highest recorded. Here we resolve this apparent inconsistency with a phylogenetic analysis of 267 bird species, demonstrating that cooperative breeding is associated with low promiscuity; that in cooperative species, helping is more common when promiscuity is low; and that intermediate levels of promiscuity favour kin discrimination. Overall, these results suggest that promiscuity is a unifying feature across taxa in explaining transitions to and from cooperative societies.","[Cornwallis, Charlie K.; Griffin, Ashleigh S.] Univ Oxford, Dept Zool, Edward Grey Inst, Oxford OX1 3PS, England; [West, Stuart A.] Univ Oxford, Dept Zool, Oxford OX1 3PS, England; [Davis, Katie E.] Nat Hist Museum, Dept Entomol, London SW7 5BD, England","Griffin, AS (reprint author), Univ Oxford, Dept Zool, Edward Grey Inst, S Parks Rd, Oxford OX1 3PS, England.",ashleigh.griffin@zoo.ox.ac.uk,"Cornwallis, Charlie/A-6276-2012; Griffin, Ashleigh/C-6244-2014; West, Stuart/M-3608-2014","Griffin, Ashleigh/0000-0001-7674-9825; West, Stuart/0000-0003-2152-3153",ERC; Royal Society,"We thank J.

Efforts to control it are hampered by difficulties with diagnosis, prevention and treatment(1,2). Most people infected with M. tuberculosis remain asymptomatic, termed latent TB, with a 10% lifetime risk of developing active TB disease. Current tests, however, cannot identify which individuals will develop disease(3). The immune response to M. tuberculosis is complex and incompletely characterized, hindering development of new diagnostics, therapies and vaccines(4,5). Here we identify a whole-blood 393 transcript signature for active TB in intermediate and high-burden settings, correlating with radiological extent of disease and reverting to that of healthy controls after treatment. A subset of patients with latent TB had signatures similar to those in patients with active TB. We also identify a specific 86-transcript signature that discriminates active TB from other inflammatory and infectious diseases. Modular and pathway analysis revealed that the TB signature was dominated by a neutrophil-driven interferon (IFN)-inducible gene profile, consisting of both IFN-gamma and type I IFN-alpha beta signalling. Comparison with transcriptional signatures in purified cells and flow cytometric analysis suggest that this TB signature reflects changes in cellular composition and altered gene expression. Although an IFN-inducible signature was also observed in whole blood of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), their complete modular signature differed from TB, with increased abundance of plasma cell transcripts. Our studies demonstrate a hitherto underappreciated role of type I IFN-alpha beta signalling in the pathogenesis of TB, which has implications for vaccine and therapeutic development. Our study also provides a broad range of transcriptional biomarkers with potential as diagnostic and prognostic tools to combat the TB epidemic.","[Berry, Matthew P.

It contains thymic epithelial cells (TECs) that form a complex three-dimensional network organized in cortical and medullary compartments, the organization of which is notably different from simple or stratified epithelia(4). TECs have an essential role in the generation of self-tolerant thymocytes through expression of the autoimmune regulator Aire(5,6), but the mechanisms involved in the specification and maintenance of TECs remain unclear(7-9). Despite the different embryological origins of thymus and skin (endodermal and ectodermal, respectively), some cells of the thymic medulla express stratified-epithelium markers(10-12), interpreted as promiscuous gene expression. Here we show that the thymus of the rat contains a population of clonogenic TECs that can be extensively cultured while conserving the capacity to integrate in a thymic epithelial network and to express major histocompatibility complex class II (MHC II) molecules and Aire. These cells can irreversibly adopt the fate of hair follicle multipotent stem cells when exposed to an inductive skin microenvironment; this change in fate is correlated with robust changes in gene expression. Hence, microenvironmental cues are sufficient here to re-direct epithelial cell fate, allowing crossing of primitive germ layer boundaries and an increase in potency(13).","[Bonfanti, Paola; Claudinot, Stephanie; Amici, Alessandro W.; Barrandon, Yann] Ecole Polytech Fed Lausanne, Sch Life Sci, Lab Stem Cell Dynam, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland; [Bonfanti, Paola; Claudinot, Stephanie; Amici, Alessandro W.; Barrandon, Yann] CHU Vaudois, Univ Lausanne Hosp, Dept Expt Surg, CH-1011 Lausanne, Switzerland; [Farley, Alison; Blackburn, C.

The expression of two inherited alleles is sometimes biased by the effects known as dominant/recessive relationships, which determine the final phenotype of the organism. To explore the mechanisms underlying these relationships, we have examined the monoallelic expression of S-locus protein 11 genes (SP11), which encode the male determinants of self-incompatibility in Brassica. We previously reported that SP11 expression was monoallelic in some S heterozygotes, and that the promoter regions of recessive SP11 alleles were specifically methylated in the anther tapetum(1-3). Here we show that this methylation is controlled by trans-acting small non-coding RNA(sRNA). We identified inverted genomic sequences that were similar to the recessive SP11 promoters in the flanking regions of dominant SP11 alleles. These sequences were specifically expressed in the anther tapetum and processed into 24-nucleotide sRNA, named SP11 methylation inducer (Smi). Introduction of the Smi genomic region into the recessive S homozygotes triggered the methylation of the promoter of recessive SP11 alleles and repressed their transcription. This is an example showing sRNA encoded in the flanking region of a dominant allele acts in trans to induce transcriptional silencing of the recessive allele. Our finding may provide new insights into the widespread monoallelic gene expression systems.","[Tarutani, Yoshiaki; Shiba, Hiroshi; Iwano, Megumi; Isogai, Akira; Takayama, Seiji] Nara Inst Sci & Technol, Grad Sch Biol Sci, Ikoma 6300192, Japan; [Kakizaki, Tomohiro] Iwate Univ, Fac Agr, Morioka, Iwate 0208550, Japan; [Suzuki, Go] Osaka Kyoiku Univ, Div Nat Sci, Osaka 5828582, Japan; [Watanabe, Masao] Tohoku Univ, Grad Sch Life Sci, Aoba Ku, Sendai, Miyagi 9808577, Japan","Takayama, S (reprint author), Nara Inst Sci & Technol, Grad Sch Biol Sci, 8916-5 Takayama, Ikoma 6300192, Japan.",takayama@bs.naist.jp,"KAKIZAKI, Tomohiro/E-6304-2011; Watanabe, Masao/E-6300-2011","KAKIZAKI, Tomohiro/0000-0002-3636-6616; Watanabe, Masao/0000-0002-9419-5149","Bio-oriented Technology Research Advancement Institution (BRAIN); Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS); Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT)","We thank Q.

These sites also correspond to high levels of H3K27 monomethylation, and mutation of the catalytic SET domain is sufficient to cause the re-replication defect.

VWF is a concatenated, multifunctional protein that has binding sites for platelets as well as subendothelial collagen(1,2). Binding of the A1 domain in VWF to the glycoprotein Ib alpha subunit (GPIb alpha) on the surface of platelets mediates crosslinking of platelets to one another and the formation of a platelet plug for arterioles(3,4). The importance of VWF is illustrated by its mutation in von Willebrand disease, a bleeding diathesis(1). Here, we describe a novel mechanochemical specialization of the A1-GPIb alpha bond for force-resistance. We have developed a method that enables, for the first time, repeated measurements of the binding and unbinding of a receptor and ligand in a single molecule (ReaLiSM). We demonstrate two states of the receptor-ligand bond, that is, a flex-bond. One state is seen at low force; a second state begins to engage at 10 pN with a similar to 20-fold longer lifetime and greater force resistance. The lifetimes of the two states, how force exponentiates lifetime, and the kinetics of switching between the two states are all measured. For the first time, single-molecule measurements on this system are in agreement with bulk phase measurements. The results have important implications not only for how platelets bound to VWF are able to resist force to plug arterioles, but also how increased flow activates platelet plug formation.","[Kim, Jongseong; Zhang, Cheng-Zhong; Zhang, Xiaohui; Springer, Timothy A.] Childrens Hosp, Immune Dis Inst, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Kim, Jongseong; Zhang, Cheng-Zhong; Zhang, Xiaohui; Springer, Timothy A.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Pathol, Boston, MA 02115 USA","Springer, TA (reprint author), Childrens Hosp, Immune Dis Inst, 3 Blackfan Circle, Boston, MA 02115 USA.",springer@idi.harvard.edu,"Kim, Jongseong/M-9940-2014; Kim, Jongseong/I-6358-2013","Kim, Jongseong/0000-0001-9595-2765; Kim, Jongseong/0000-0002-9553-2258",NIH [HL-48675],"Supported by NIH HL-48675 (TAS).

The motor uses the potential energy from an electrochemical gradient of cations(4,5) across the cytoplasmic membrane to generate torque. A rapid switch from anticlockwise to clockwise rotation determines whether a bacterium runs smoothly forward or tumbles to change its trajectory(6,7). A protein called FliG forms a ring in the rotor of the flagellar motor that is involved in the generation of torque(8-13) through an interaction with the cation-channel-forming stator subunit MotA(12). FliG has been suggested to adopt distinct conformations that induce switching but these structural changes and the molecular mechanism of switching are unknown. Here we report the molecular structure of the full-length FliG protein, identify conformational changes that are involved in rotational switching and uncover the structural basis for the formation of the FliG torque ring. This allows us to propose a model of the complete ring and switching mechanism in which conformational changes in FliG reverse the electrostatic charges involved in torque generation.","[Lee, Lawrence K.; Ginsburg, Michael A.; Donohoe, Mhairi; Stock, Daniela] Victor Chang Cardiac Res Inst, Struct & Computat Biol Div, Darlinghurst, NSW 2010, Australia; [Crovace, Claudia] MRC, Mol Biol Lab, Cambridge CB2 2QH, England; [Stock, Daniela] Univ New S Wales, Fac Med, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia","Stock, D (reprint author), Victor Chang Cardiac Res Inst, Struct & Computat Biol Div, Lowy Packer Bldg,405 Liverpool St, Darlinghurst, NSW 2010, Australia.",d.stock@victorchang.edu.au,,,"US Department of Energy, Basic Energy Sciences, Office of Science [DE-AC02-06CH11357]; National Institutes of Health, National Center for Research Resources [RR007707]; National Cancer Institute [Y1-CO-1020]; National Institute of General Medical Science [Y1-GM-1104]; Australian Nuclear Science Technology Organization; MRC","We thank the staff at beamline ID14-1 at the ESRF, and at beamlines 14-ID (BioCARS) and 23-ID (General Medicine and Cancer Institutes Collaborative Access Team (GM/CA-CAT)) at the APS for their support.

Deficiencies in PCC activity in humans are linked to the disease propionic acidaemia, an autosomal recessive disorder that can be fatal in infants(1-4). The holoenzyme of PCC is an alpha(6)beta(6) dodecamer, with a molecular mass of 750 kDa. The alpha-subunit contains the biotin carboxylase (BC) and biotin carboxyl carrier protein (BCCP) domains, whereas the beta-subunit supplies the carboxyltransferase (CT) activity. Here we report the crystal structure at 3.2-angstrom resolution of a bacterial PCC alpha(6)beta(6) holoenzyme as well as cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) reconstruction at 15-angstrom resolution demonstrating a similar structure for human PCC. The structure defines the overall architecture of PCC and reveals unexpectedly that the alpha-subunits are arranged as monomers in the holoenzyme, decorating a central beta(6) hexamer. A hitherto unrecognized domain in the alpha-subunit, formed by residues between the BC and BCCP domains, is crucial for interactions with the beta-subunit. We have named it the BT domain. The structure reveals for the first time the relative positions of the BC and CT active sites in the holoenzyme. They are separated by approximately 55 angstrom, indicating that the entire BCCP domain must translocate during catalysis. The BCCP domain is located in the active site of the beta-subunit in the current structure, providing insight for its involvement in the CT reaction. The structural information establishes a molecular basis for understanding the large collection of disease-causing mutations in PCC and is relevant for the holoenzymes of other biotin-dependent carboxylases, including 3-methylcrotonyl-CoA carboxylase (MCC)(5-7) and eukaryotic acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC)(8,9).","[Huang, Christine S.; Sadre-Bazzaz, Kianoush; Shen, Yang; Tong, Liang] Columbia Univ, Dept Biol Sci, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Deng, Binbin; Zhou, Z.

Here we demonstrate that mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), identified using nestin expression, constitute an essential HSC niche component. Nestin(+) MSCs contain all the bone-marrow colony-forming-unit fibroblastic activity and can be propagated as non-adherent 'mesenspheres' that can self-renew and expand in serial transplantations. Nestin(+) MSCs are spatially associated with HSCs and adrenergic nerve fibres, and highly express HSC maintenance genes. These genes, and others triggering osteoblastic differentiation, are selectively downregulated during enforced HSC mobilization or beta 3 adrenoreceptor activation. Whereas parathormone administration doubles the number of bone marrow nestin(+) cells and favours their osteoblastic differentiation, in vivo nestin(+) cell depletion rapidly reduces HSC content in the bone marrow. Purified HSCs home near nestin(+) MSCs in the bone marrow of lethally irradiated mice, whereas in vivo nestin(+) cell depletion significantly reduces bone marrow homing of haematopoietic progenitors. These results uncover an unprecedented partnership between two distinct somatic stem-cell types and are indicative of a unique niche in the bone marrow made of heterotypic stem-cell pairs.","[Mendez-Ferrer, Simon; Lira, Sergio A.; Frenette, Paul S.] Mt Sinai Sch Med, Dept Med, New York, NY 10029 USA; [Mendez-Ferrer, Simon; Frenette, Paul S.] Mt Sinai Sch Med, Dept Gene & Cell Med, New York, NY 10029 USA; [Michurina, Tatyana V.; Enikolopov, Grigori N.] Cold Spring Harbor Lab, Cold Spring Harbor, NY 11724 USA; [Ferraro, Francesca; Scadden, David T.] Harvard Univ, Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Sch Med, Ctr Regenerat Med, Boston, MA 02114 USA; [Mazloom, Amin R.; MacArthur, Ben D.; Ma'ayan, Avi] Mt Sinai Sch Med, Dept Pharmacol & Syst Therapeut, New York, NY 10029 USA; [Frenette, Paul S.] Yeshiva Univ Albert Einstein Coll Med, Ruth L & David S Gottesman Inst Stem Cell & Regen, Bronx, NY 10461 USA","Frenette, PS (reprint author), Mt Sinai Sch Med, Dept Med, New York, NY 10029 USA.",simon.mendez-ferrer@cnic.es; paul.frenette@einstein.yu.edu,"Frenette, Paul/J-8272-2012; Mendez-Ferrer, Simon/L-8088-2014","Mendez-Ferrer, Simon/0000-0002-9805-9988; MacArthur, Ben/0000-0002-5396-9750; Enikolopov, Grigori/0000-0001-8178-8917","National Institutes of Health [DK056638, HL69438, HL097819]; Department of Defence [PC060271]; National Institute of Mental Health; Ira Hazan Fund; American Society of Hematology","We thank M.

Repression of these regulatory targets leads to decreased translational efficiency and/or decreased mRNA levels, but the relative contributions of these two outcomes have been largely unknown, particularly for endogenous targets expressed at low-to-moderate levels. Here, we use ribosome profiling to measure the overall effects on protein production and compare these to simultaneously measured effects on mRNA levels. For both ectopic and endogenous miRNA regulatory interactions, lowered mRNA levels account for most (>= 84%) of the decreased protein production. These results show that changes in mRNA levels closely reflect the impact of miRNAs on gene expression and indicate that destabilization of target mRNAs is the predominant reason for reduced protein output.","[Guo, Huili; Bartel, David P.] Whitehead Inst Biomed Res, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; [Guo, Huili; Bartel, David P.] MIT, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Guo, Huili; Bartel, David P.] MIT, Dept Biol, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Ingolia, Nicholas T.; Weissman, Jonathan S.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Howard Hughes Med Inst, San Francisco, CA 94158 USA; [Ingolia, Nicholas T.; Weissman, Jonathan S.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Cellular & Mol Pharmacol, San Francisco, CA 94158 USA; [Ingolia, Nicholas T.; Weissman, Jonathan S.] Calif Inst Quantitat Biosci, San Francisco, CA 94158 USA","Bartel, DP (reprint author), Whitehead Inst Biomed Res, 9 Cambridge Ctr, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA.",dbartel@wi.mit.edu,,,"NIH; Agency for Science, Technology and Research, Singapore; Ruth L.

Resulting applications such as giant magnetoresistive field sensors and spin torque devices are fuelling advances in information and communications technology, magnetoelectronic sensing and biomedicine(1,2). There is an urgent need for high-resolution magnetic-imaging tools capable of characterizing these complex, often buried, nanoscale structures. Conventional ferromagnetic resonance(3,4) (FMR) provides quantitative information about ferromagnetic materials and interacting multicomponent magnetic structures with spectroscopic precision and can distinguish components of complex bulk samples through their distinctive spectroscopic features. However, it lacks the sensitivity to probe nanoscale volumes and has no imaging capabilities. Here we demonstrate FMR imaging through spin-wave localization. Although the strong interactions in a ferromagnet favour the excitation of extended collective modes, we show that the intense, spatially confined magnetic field of the micromagnetic probe tip used in FMR force microscopy can be used to localize the FMR mode immediately beneath the probe. We demonstrate FMR modes localized within volumes having 200 nm lateral dimensions, and improvements of the approach may allow these dimensions to be decreased to tens of nanometres. Our study shows that this approach is capable of providing the microscopic detail required for the characterization of ferromagnets used in fields ranging from spintronics to biomagnetism. This method is applicable to buried and surface magnets, and, being a resonance technique, measures local internal fields and other magnetic properties with spectroscopic precision.","[Lee, Inhee; Obukhov, Yuri; Xiang, Gang; Hauser, Adam; Yang, Fengyuan; Banerjee, Palash; Pelekhov, Denis V.; Hammel, P.

These cloud patterns can be observed in satellite images of the Earth and often exhibit distinct cell-like structures associated with organized convection at scales of tens of kilometres(1-3). Recent evidence has shown that atmospheric aerosol particles-through their influence on precipitation formation-help to determine whether cloud fields take on closed (more reflective) or open (less reflective) cellular patterns(4,5). The physical mechanisms controlling the formation and evolution of these cells, however, are still poorly understood(6), limiting our ability to simulate realistically the effects of clouds on global reflectance. Here we use satellite imagery and numerical models to show how precipitating clouds produce an open cellular cloud pattern that oscillates between different, weakly stable states. The oscillations are a result of precipitation causing downward motion and outflow from clouds that were previously positively buoyant. The evaporating precipitation drives air down to the Earth's surface, where it diverges and collides with the outflows of neighbouring precipitating cells. These colliding outflows form surface convergence zones and new cloud formation. In turn, the newly formed clouds produce precipitation and new colliding outflow patterns that are displaced from the previous ones. As successive cycles of this kind unfold, convergence zones alternate with divergence zones and new cloud patterns emerge to replace old ones. The result is an oscillating, self-organized system with a characteristic cell size and precipitation frequency.","[Feingold, Graham; Brewer, Wm.

However, terrestrial lavas with high (3)He/(4)He ratios have never been observed to host the primitive lead-isotopic compositions that are required for an early (roughly 4.5 Gyr ago) formation age(1,2). Here we show that Cenozoic-era Baffin Island and West Greenland lavas, previously found to host the highest terrestrial-mantle (3)He/(4)He ratios(3-5), exhibit primitive lead-isotope ratios that are consistent with an ancient mantle source age of 4.55-4.45 Gyr. The Baffin Island and West Greenland lavas also exhibit (143)Nd/(144)Nd ratios similar to values recently proposed for an early-formed (roughly 4.5 Gyr ago) terrestrial mantle reservoir(6,7). The combined helium-, lead- and Nd-isotopic compositions in Baffin Island and West Greenland lavas therefore suggest that their source is the most ancient accessible reservoir in the Earth's mantle, and it may be parental to all mantle reservoirs that give rise to modern volcanism.","[Jackson, Matthew G.] Boston Univ, Dept Earth Sci, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Jackson, Matthew G.; Carlson, Richard W.] Carnegie Inst Washington, Dept Terr Magnetism, Washington, DC 20015 USA; [Kurz, Mark D.] Woods Hole Oceanog Inst, Dept Marine Chem, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA; [Kempton, Pamela D.] NERC, Swindon SN2 1EU, Wilts, England; [Francis, Don] McGill Univ, Montreal, PQ H3A 2A7, Canada; [Blusztajn, Jerzy] Woods Hole Oceanog Inst, Dept Geol & Geophys, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA","Jackson, MG (reprint author), Boston Univ, Dept Earth Sci, 675 Commonwealth Ave, Boston, MA 02215 USA.",jacksonm@bu.edu,,"Kurz, Mark/0000-0003-1745-2356",Carnegie postdoctoral fellowship,"M.G.J. acknowledges his Carnegie postdoctoral fellowship.

However, both the emergence and the stability of costly punishment are problematic issues. It is not clear how punishers can invade a society of defectors by social learning or natural selection, or how second-order free-riders (who contribute to the joint effort but not to the sanctions) can be prevented from drifting into a coercion-based regime and subverting cooperation. Here we compare the prevailing model of peer-punishment(6-8) with pool-punishment, which consists in committing resources, before the collaborative effort, to prepare sanctions against free-riders. Pool-punishment facilitates the sanctioning of second-order free-riders, because these are exposed even if everyone contributes to the common good. In the absence of such second-order punishment, peer-punishers do better than pool-punishers; but with second-order punishment, the situation is reversed. Efficiency is traded for stability. Neither other-regarding tendencies or preferences for reciprocity and equity, nor group selection or prescriptions from higher authorities, are necessary for the emergence and stability of rudimentary forms of sanctioning institutions regulating common pool resources and enforcing collaborative efforts.","[Sigmund, Karl] Univ Vienna, Fac Math, A-1090 Vienna, Austria; [Sigmund, Karl] Int Inst Appl Syst Anal, A-2361 Laxenburg, Austria; [De Silva, Hannelore] WU Vienna Univ Econ & Business, A-1090 Vienna, Austria; [Traulsen, Arne] Max Planck Inst Evolutionary Biol, D-24306 Plon, Germany; [Hauert, Christoph] Univ British Columbia, Dept Math, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z2, Canada","Sigmund, K (reprint author), Univ Vienna, Fac Math, Waehringer Guertel 18, A-1090 Vienna, Austria.",karl.sigmund@univie.ac.at,"Traulsen, Arne/A-4955-2009; Hauert, Christoph/E-5369-2011","Traulsen, Arne/0000-0002-0669-5267; Hauert, Christoph/0000-0002-1239-281X",,,,30,191,194,3,76,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,12-Aug,2010,466,7308,,,,,861,863,,10.1038/nature09203,,3,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,636TT,WOS:000280766100035,20631710,No,,,11/20/17

Studies in children demonstrate that AT is an important risk factor for the later development of anxiety disorders, depression and comorbid substance abuse(5). Despite its importance as an early predictor of psychopathology, little is known about the factors that predispose vulnerable children to develop AT and the brain systems that underlie its expression. To characterize the neural circuitry associated with AT and the extent to which the function of this circuit is heritable, we studied a large sample of rhesus monkeys phenotyped for AT. Using 238 young monkeys from a multigenerational single-family pedigree, we simultaneously assessed brain metabolic activity and AT while monkeys were exposed to the relevant ethological condition that elicits the phenotype. High-resolution (18)F-labelled deoxyglucose positron-emission tomography (FDG-PET) was selected as the imaging modality because it provides semi-quantitative indices of absolute glucose metabolic rate, allows for simultaneous measurement of behaviour and brain activity, and has a time course suited for assessing temperament-associated sustained brain responses. Here we demonstrate that the central nucleus region of the amygdala and the anterior hippocampus are key components of the neural circuit predictive of AT. We also show significant heritability of the AT phenotype by using quantitative genetic analysis. Additionally, using voxelwise analyses, we reveal significant heritability of metabolic activity in AT-associated hippocampal regions. However, activity in the amygdala region predictive of AT is not significantly heritable. Furthermore, the heritabilities of the hippocampal and amygdala regions significantly differ from each other. Even though these structures are closely linked, the results suggest differential influences of genes and environment on how these brain regions mediate AT and the ongoing risk of developing anxiety and depression.","[Oler, Jonathan A.; Shelton, Steven E.; Davidson, Richard J.; Kalin, Ned H.] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Psychiat, Madison, WI 53719 USA; [Fox, Andrew S.; Davidson, Richard J.; Kalin, Ned H.] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Psychol, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Oler, Jonathan A.; Shelton, Steven E.; Davidson, Richard J.; Kalin, Ned H.] Univ Wisconsin, HealthEmot Res Inst, Madison, WI 53719 USA; [Fox, Andrew S.; Davidson, Richard J.; Oakes, Terrence R.; Kalin, Ned H.] Univ Wisconsin, Waisman Lab Brain Imaging & Behav, Madison, WI 53705 USA; [Rogers, Jeffrey] Baylor Coll Med, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Rogers, Jeffrey; Dyer, Thomas D.; Shelledy, Wendy; Blangero, John] SW Fdn Biomed Res, San Antonio, TX 78227 USA","Kalin, NH (reprint author), Univ Wisconsin, Dept Psychiat, Madison, WI 53719 USA.",nkalin@wisc.edu,,,"National Institutes of Health [MH046729, MH081884, MH084051, MH018931, MH059490]; HealthEmotions Research Institute","This work has been supported by National Institutes of Health grants MH046729 (to N.H.K.), MH081884 (to N.H.K. and J.R.), MH084051 (to R.J.D. and N.H.K.), MH018931 (to J.A.O., A.

Here we report the identification of 2,576 somatic mutations across similar to 1,800 megabases of DNA representing 1,507 coding genes from 441 tumours comprising breast, lung, ovarian and prostate cancer types and subtypes. We found that mutation rates and the sets of mutated genes varied substantially across tumour types and subtypes. Statistical analysis identified 77 significantly mutated genes including protein kinases, G-protein-coupled receptors such as GRM8, BAI3, AGTRL1 (also called APLNR) and LPHN3, and other druggable targets. Integrated analysis of somatic mutations and copy number alterations identified another 35 significantly altered genes including GNAS, indicating an expanded role for G alpha subunits in multiple cancer types. Furthermore, our experimental analyses demonstrate the functional roles of mutant GNAO1 (a G alpha subunit) and mutant MAP2K4 (a member of the JNK signalling pathway) in oncogenesis. Our study provides an overview of the mutational spectra across major human cancers and identifies several potential therapeutic targets.","[Kan, Zhengyan; Jaiswal, Bijay S.; Stinson, Jeremy; Janakiraman, Vasantharajan; Bhatt, Deepali; Chaudhuri, Subhra; Peters, Brock A.; Pujara, Kanan; Cordes, Shaun; Davis, David P.; Yuan, Wenlin; Modrusan, Zora; Stokoe, David; de Sauvage, Frederic J.; Seshagiri, Somasekar] Genentech Inc, Dept Mol Biol, San Francisco, CA 94080 USA; [Kan, Zhengyan; Yue, Peng; Haverty, Peter M.; Bourgon, Richard; Li, Li; Kaminker, Joshua S.; Zhang, Zemin] Genentech Inc, Dept Bioinformat, San Francisco, CA 94080 USA; [Stern, Howard M.; Eberhard, David A.; Waring, Paul] Genentech Inc, Dept Pathol, San Francisco, CA 94080 USA; [Zheng, Jianbiao; Moorhead, Martin; Carlton, Victoria E.

The fundamental mechanisms that regulate the establishment and maintenance of such electrical polarities are poorly understood. Here we identify a gradient of electrical coupling across the developing ventricular myocardium using high-speed optical mapping of transmembrane potentials and calcium concentrations in the zebrafish heart. We excluded a role for differences in cellular excitability, connexin localization, tissue geometry and mechanical inputs, but in contrast we were able to demonstrate that non-canonical Wnt11 signals are required for the genesis of this myocardial electrical gradient. Although the traditional planar cell polarity pathway is not involved, we obtained evidence that Wnt11 acts to set up this gradient of electrical coupling through effects on transmembrane Ca2+ conductance mediated by the L-type calcium channel. These data reveal a previously unrecognized role for Wnt/Ca2+ signalling in establishing an electrical gradient in the plane of the developing cardiac epithelium through modulation of ion-channel function. The regulation of cellular coupling through such mechanisms may be a general property of non-canonical Wnt signals.","[Panakova, Daniela; Werdich, Andreas A.; MacRae, Calum A.] Harvard Univ, Brigham & Womens Hosp, Sch Med, Div Cardiovasc, Boston, MA 02115 USA","MacRae, CA (reprint author), Harvard Univ, Brigham & Womens Hosp, Sch Med, Div Cardiovasc, 75 Francis St,Thorn 11, Boston, MA 02115 USA.",camacrae@bics.bwh.harvard.edu,,,HFSP; NIH; March of Dimes,"We thank C.

The 300-kDa gamma-tubulin small complex (gamma-TuSC), consisting of two molecules of gamma-tubulin and one copy each of the accessory proteins Spc97 and Spc98, is the conserved, essential core of the microtubule nucleating machinery(1,2). In metazoa multiple gamma-TuSCs assemble with other proteins into gamma-tubulin ring complexes (gamma-TuRCs). The structure of gamma-TuRC indicated that it functions as a microtubule template(2-5). Because each gamma-TuSC contains two molecules of gamma-tubulin, it was assumed that the gamma-TuRC-specific proteins are required to organize gamma-TuSCs to match 13-fold microtubule symmetry. Here we show that Saccharomyces cerevisiae gamma-TuSC forms rings even in the absence of other gamma-TuRC components. The yeast adaptor protein Spc110 stabilizes the rings into extended filaments and is required for oligomer formation under physiological buffer conditions. The 8-angstrom cryo-electron microscopic reconstruction of the filament reveals 13 gamma-tubulins per turn, matching microtubule symmetry, with plus ends exposed for interaction with microtubules, implying that one turn of the filament constitutes a microtubule template. The domain structures of Spc97 and Spc98 suggest functions for conserved sequence motifs, with implications for the gamma-TuRC-specific proteins. The gamma-TuSC filaments nucleate microtubules at a low level, and the structure provides a strong hypothesis for how nucleation is regulated, converting this less active form to a potent nucleator.","[Kollman, Justin M.; Agard, David A.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Biochem & Biophys, Howard Hughes Med Inst, San Francisco, CA 94158 USA; [Kollman, Justin M.; Agard, David A.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Keck Adv Microscopy Ctr, San Francisco, CA 94158 USA; [Zelter, Alex; Davis, Trisha N.] Univ Washington, Dept Biochem, Seattle, WA 98195 USA","Agard, DA (reprint author), Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Biochem & Biophys, Howard Hughes Med Inst, San Francisco, CA 94158 USA.",agard@msg.ucsf.edu,"Kollman, Justin/F-3012-2012","Davis, Trisha/0000-0003-4797-3152",National Institutes of Health (NIH) through the National Center for Research Resources'; NIH; Howard Hughes Medical Institute,"We thank M.

Under normal conditions, LexA represses the transcription of many DNA repair proteins by binding to SOS 'boxes' in their operators. Under genotoxic stress, accumulating complexes of RecA, ATP and single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) activate LexA for autocleavage. To address how LexA recognizes its binding sites, we determined three crystal structures of Escherichia coli LexA in complex with SOS boxes. Here we report the structure of these LexA-DNA complexes. The DNA-binding domains of the LexA dimer interact with the DNA in the classical fashion of a winged helix-turn-helix motif. However, the wings of these two DNA-binding domains bind to the same minor groove of the DNA. These wing-wing contacts may explain why the spacing between the two half-sites of E. coli SOS boxes is invariant.","[Pigli, Ying Z.; Rice, Phoebe A.] Univ Chicago, Dept Biochem & Mol Biol, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Zhang, Adrianna P.

This lesion interferes with replication and transcription, and may result in mutation and cell death(2). In many organisms, a flavoenzyme called photolyase uses blue light energy to repair the 6-4PP (ref. 3). The molecular mechanism of the repair reaction is poorly understood. Here, we use ultrafast spectroscopy to show that the key step in the repair photocycle is a cyclic proton transfer between the enzyme and the substrate. By femtosecond synchronization of the enzymatic dynamics with the repair function, we followed the function evolution and observed direct electron transfer from the excited flavin cofactor to the 6-4PP in 225 picoseconds, but surprisingly fast back electron transfer in 50 picoseconds without repair. We found that the catalytic proton transfer between a histidine residue in the active site and the 6-4PP, induced by the initial photoinduced electron transfer from the excited flavin cofactor to 6-4PP, occurs in 425 picoseconds and leads to 6-4PP repair in tens of nanoseconds. These key dynamics define the repair photocycle and explain the underlying molecular mechanism of the enzyme's modest efficiency.","[Li, Jiang; Liu, Zheyun; Tan, Chuang; Guo, Xunmin; Wang, Lijuan; Zhong, Dongping] Ohio State Univ, Dept Phys, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Li, Jiang; Liu, Zheyun; Tan, Chuang; Guo, Xunmin; Wang, Lijuan; Zhong, Dongping] Ohio State Univ, Dept Chem, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Li, Jiang; Liu, Zheyun; Tan, Chuang; Guo, Xunmin; Wang, Lijuan; Zhong, Dongping] Ohio State Univ, Dept Biochem, Program Biophys, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Li, Jiang; Liu, Zheyun; Tan, Chuang; Guo, Xunmin; Wang, Lijuan; Zhong, Dongping] Ohio State Univ, Chem Phys Program, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Li, Jiang; Liu, Zheyun; Tan, Chuang; Guo, Xunmin; Wang, Lijuan; Zhong, Dongping] Ohio State Univ, Program Biochem, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Sancar, Aziz] Univ N Carolina, Sch Med, Dept Biochem & Biophys, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA","Zhong, DP (reprint author), Ohio State Univ, Dept Phys, 191 W Woodruff Ave, Columbus, OH 43210 USA.",dongping@mps.ohio-state.edu,"Guo, Xunmin/E-7908-2013; Zhong, Dongping/I-2444-2013; Liu, Zheyun/N-4054-2013","Zhong, Dongping/0000-0001-9381-8992; ",National Institutes of Health [GM074813]; Packard fellowship,We thank T.

We screened the genome for common variants associated with plasma lipids in >100,000 individuals of European ancestry. Here we report 95 significantly associated loci (P<5 x 10(-8)), with 59 showing genome-wide significant association with lipid traits for the first time. The newly reported associations include single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) near known lipid regulators (for example, CYP7A1, NPC1L1 and SCARB1) as well as in scores of loci not previously implicated in lipoprotein metabolism. The 95 loci contribute not only to normal variation in lipid traits but also to extreme lipid phenotypes and have an impact on lipid traits in three non-European populations (East Asians, South Asians and African Americans). Our results identify several novel loci associated with plasma lipids that are also associated with CAD. Finally, we validated three of the novel genes-GALNT2, PPP1R3B and TTC39B-with experiments in mouse models. Taken together, our findings provide the foundation to develop a broader biological understanding of lipoprotein metabolism and to identify new therapeutic opportunities for the prevention of CAD.","[Musunuru, Kiran; Pirruccello, James P.; Voight, Benjamin F.; Bandinelli, Stefania; Altshuler, David; Kathiresan, Sekar] Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Ctr Human Genet Res, Boston, MA 02114 USA; [Teslovich, Tanya M.; Willer, Cristen J.; Stringham, Heather M.; Bergman, Richard N.; Abecasis, Goncalo R.; Boehnke, Michael] Univ Michigan, Dept Biostat, Ctr Stat Genet, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Musunuru, Kiran; Ballantyne, Christie M.; Kathiresan, Sekar] Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Cardiovasc Res Ctr, Boston, MA 02114 USA; [Musunuru, Kiran; Pirruccello, James P.; Voight, Benjamin F.; Guiducci, Candace; Gonzalez, Elena; Ejebe, Kenechi G.; Crawford, Gabriel; Burtt, Noel P.; Altshuler, David; Wong, Tien Y.; Gabriel, Stacey B.; Kathiresan, Sekar] Broad Inst, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; [Musunuru, Kiran; Chasman, Daniel I.; Zee, Robert Y.

Here we show through a series of studies in human cohorts and human-derived hepatocytes that a common noncoding polymorphism at the 1p13 locus, rs12740374, creates a C/EBP (CCAAT/enhancer binding protein) transcription factor binding site and alters the hepatic expression of the SORT1 gene. With small interfering RNA (siRNA) knockdown and viral overexpression in mouse liver, we demonstrate that Sort1 alters plasma LDL-C and very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) particle levels by modulating hepatic VLDL secretion. Thus, we provide functional evidence for a novel regulatory pathway for lipoprotein metabolism and suggest that modulation of this pathway may alter risk for MI in humans. We also demonstrate that common noncoding DNA variants identified by GWASs can directly contribute to clinical phenotypes.","[Strong, Alanna; Sachs, Katherine V.; Li, Xiaoyu; Li, Hui; Rader, Daniel J.] Univ Penn, Sch Med, Inst Translat Med & Therapeut, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Strong, Alanna; Sachs, Katherine V.; Li, Xiaoyu; Li, Hui; Rader, Daniel J.] Univ Penn, Sch Med, Inst Diabet Obes & Metab, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Strong, Alanna; Sachs, Katherine V.; Li, Xiaoyu; Li, Hui; Rader, Daniel J.] Univ Penn, Sch Med, Cardiovasc Inst, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Musunuru, Kiran; Lee, Noemi E.; Ahfeldt, Tim; Kuperwasser, Nicolas; Ruda, Vera M.; Pirruccello, James P.; Ejebe, Kenechi G.; Cowan, Chad A.; Kathiresan, Sekar] Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Cardiovasc Res Ctr, Boston, MA 02114 USA; [Musunuru, Kiran; Lee, Noemi E.; Ahfeldt, Tim; Kuperwasser, Nicolas; Ruda, Vera M.; Pirruccello, James P.; Ejebe, Kenechi G.; Cowan, Chad A.; Kathiresan, Sekar] Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Ctr Human Genet Res, Boston, MA 02114 USA; [Musunuru, Kiran; Lee, Noemi E.; Kuperwasser, Nicolas; Ruda, Vera M.; Pirruccello, James P.; Ejebe, Kenechi G.; Cowan, Chad A.; Kathiresan, Sekar] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Boston, MA 02114 USA; [Musunuru, Kiran; Pirruccello, James P.; Hall, Jennifer L.; Ejebe, Kenechi G.; Cowan, Chad A.; Kathiresan, Sekar] Broad Inst, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; [Musunuru, Kiran] Johns Hopkins Univ, Sch Med, Div Cardiol, Baltimore, MD 21287 USA; [Frank-Kamenetsky, Maria; Wong, Jamie; Cantley, William; Racie, Timothy; Koteliansky, Victor; Fitzgerald, Kevin] Alnylam Pharmaceut Inc, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; [Ahfeldt, Tim] Univ Med Ctr Hamburg Eppendorf, Dept Biochem & Mol Biol Mol Cell Biol 2, D-20246 Hamburg, Germany; [Muchmore, Brian; Prokunina-Olsson, Ludmila] NCI, Lab Translat Genom, Div Canc Epidemiol & Genet, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Hall, Jennifer L.] Univ Minnesota, Program Cardiovasc Translat Genom, Lillehei Heart Inst, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA; [Schadt, Eric E.] Sage Bionetworks, Seattle, WA 98109 USA; [Morales, Carlos R.] McGill Univ, Dept Anat & Cell Biol, Montreal, PQ H3A 2B2, Canada; [Lund-Katz, Sissel; Phillips, Michael C.] Univ Penn, Childrens Hosp Philadelphia, Sch Med, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Orho-Melander, Marju; Melander, Olle] Lund Univ, Skania Univ Hosp, Dept Clin Sci, SE-20502 Malmo, Sweden; [Krauss, Ronald M.] Childrens Hosp, Oakland Res Inst, Oakland, CA 94609 USA","Rader, DJ (reprint author), Univ Penn, Sch Med, Inst Translat Med & Therapeut, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",skathiresan@partners.org; rader@mail.med.upenn.edu,"Morales, Carlos/H-1055-2011; Ejebe, Kenechi/I-9238-2016; Ahfeldt, Tim/E-2935-2017","Ejebe, Kenechi/0000-0002-6090-8657; Prokunina-Olsson, Ludmila/0000-0002-9622-2091; Phillips, Michael/0000-0002-7147-8007","United States National Institutes of Health (NIH); NIH [K99-HL098364, U01-HL069757, RC2-HL101864, P01-HL059407]; Harvard Stem Cell Institute; Division of Cancer Epidemiology & Genetics, National Cancer Institute, NIH; Swedish Medical Research Council; Heart-Lung Foundation; Pahlsson Foundation; Quest Diagnostics, Inc.; Bristol-Myers Squibb","We thank D.

Here we present the draft genome sequence of Amphimedon queenslandica, a demosponge from the Great Barrier Reef, and show that it is remarkably similar to other animal genomes in content, structure and organization. Comparative analysis enabled by the sequencing of the sponge genome reveals genomic events linked to the origin and early evolution of animals, including the appearance, expansion and diversification of pan-metazoan transcription factor, signalling pathway and structural genes. This diverse 'toolkit' of genes correlates with critical aspects of all metazoan body plans, and comprises cell cycle control and growth, development, somatic-and germ-cell specification, cell adhesion, innate immunity and allorecognition. Notably, many of the genes associated with the emergence of animals are also implicated in cancer, which arises from defects in basic processes associated with metazoan multicellularity.","[Srivastava, Mansi; Mitros, Therese; Rokhsar, Daniel S.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mol & Cell Biol, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Srivastava, Mansi; Mitros, Therese; Rokhsar, Daniel S.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Ctr Integrat Genom, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Simakov, Oleg] Univ Heidelberg, D-69117 Heidelberg, Germany; [Chapman, Jarrod; Hellsten, Uffe; Goodstein, David M.; Shu, Shengqiang; Rokhsar, Daniel S.] Joint Genome Inst, Dept Energy, Walnut Creek, CA 94598 USA; [Fahey, Bryony; Gauthier, Marie E.

Observations must be carried out in the near infrared because of very high extinction in visible light within the Galactic plane. We need high resolution to identify cluster members from their peculiar motions 3, and because most such clusters span more than 1', efficient observation demands a wide field of view. There is at present no space-based facility that meets all these criteria. Ground-based telescopes can in principle make such observations when fitted with ground-layer adaptive optics (GLAO)(4-6), which removes the optical aberration caused by atmospheric turbulence up to an altitude of similar to 500 m (refs 7-10). A GLAO system that uses multiple laser guide stars(11-13) has been developed at the 6.5-m MMT telescope, in Arizona. In previous tests(13), the system improved the resolution of the telescope by 30-50%, limited by wavefront error in the optics, but that was insufficient to allow rapid determination of cluster membership. Here we report observations of the core of the globular cluster M3 made after commissioning a sensor to monitor and remove slowly varying aberration in the optics. In natural seeing of 0.7 '', the point spread function at 2.2-mu m wavelength was sharpened uniformly to 0.3 '' over a field of at least 2'. The wide-field resolution was enhanced by a factor of two to three over previous work(13), with better uniformity, and extends to a wavelength of 1.2 mu m. Entire stellar clusters may be examined in a single pointing, and cluster membership can be determined from two such observations separated by just one year(14-17).","[Hart, M.; Milton, N.

Entangled optical photons are now widely used for fundamental tests of quantum mechanics(2) and applications such as quantum cryptography(1). Several recent experiments demonstrated entanglement of optical photons with trapped ions(3), atoms(4,5) and atomic ensembles(6-8), which are then used to connect remote long-term memory nodes in distributed quantum networks(9-11). Here we realize quantum entanglement between the polarization of a single optical photon and a solid-state qubit associated with the single electronic spin of a nitrogen vacancy centre in diamond. Our experimental entanglement verification uses the quantum eraser technique(5,12), and demonstrates that a high degree of control over interactions between a solid-state qubit and the quantum light field can be achieved. The reported entanglement source can be used in studies of fundamental quantum phenomena and provides a key building block for the solid-state realization of quantum optical networks(13,14).","[Togan, E.; Chu, Y.; Trifonov, A.

The possibility of creating optical negative-index metamaterials (NIMs) using nanostructured metal-dielectric composites has triggered intense basic and applied research over the past several years(1-10). However, the performance of all NIM applications is significantly limited by the inherent and strong energy dissipation in metals, especially in the near-infrared and visible wavelength ranges(11,12). Generally the losses are orders of magnitude too large for the proposed applications, and the reduction of losses with optimized designs seems to be out of reach. One way of addressing this issue is to incorporate gain media into NIM designs(13-16). However, whether NIMs with low loss can be achieved has been the subject of theoretical debate(17,18). Here we experimentally demonstrate that the incorporation of gain material in the high-local-field areas of a metamaterial makes it possible to fabricate an extremely low-loss and active optical NIM. The original loss-limited negative refractive index and the figure of merit (FOM) of the device have been drastically improved with loss compensation in the visible wavelength range between 722 and 738 nm. In this range, the NIM becomes active such that the sum of the light intensities in transmission and reflection exceeds the intensity of the incident beam. At a wavelength of 737 nm, the negative refractive index improves from -0.66 to -1.017 and the FOM increases from 1 to 26. At 738 nm, the FOM is expected to become macroscopically large, of the order of 10(6). This study demonstrates the possibility of fabricating an optical negative-index metamaterial that is not limited by the inherent loss in its metal constituent.","[Xiao, Shumin; Drachev, Vladimir P.; Kildishev, Alexander V.; Ni, Xingjie; Chettiar, Uday K.; Yuan, Hsiao-Kuan; Shalaev, Vladimir M.] Purdue Univ, Birck Nanotechnol Ctr, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA; [Xiao, Shumin; Drachev, Vladimir P.; Kildishev, Alexander V.; Ni, Xingjie; Chettiar, Uday K.; Yuan, Hsiao-Kuan; Shalaev, Vladimir M.] Purdue Univ, Sch Elect & Comp Engn, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA","Shalaev, VM (reprint author), Purdue Univ, Birck Nanotechnol Ctr, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA.",shalaev@purdue.edu,"Drachev, Vladimir/J-5778-2013; Ni, Xingjie/I-2235-2012; Kildishev, Alexander/Q-8210-2017","Ni, Xingjie/0000-0001-7405-5678; Kildishev, Alexander/0000-0002-8382-8422","ARO-MURI [50342-PH-MUR, W911NF-09-1-0539]; NSF [DMR 0611430]",This work was supported in part by ARO-MURI awards 50342-PH-MUR and W911NF-09-1-0539 and by NSF PREM grant no.

In the case of electrons residing in the outer (valence) shells of atoms and molecules which are separated by electronvolt energies, this means that valence electron motion occurs on a subfemtosecond to few-femtosecond timescale (1 fs = 10(-15) s). In the absence of complete measurements, the motion can be characterized in terms of a complex quantity, the density matrix. Here we report an attosecond pump-probe measurement of the density matrix of valence electrons in atomic krypton ions(1). We generate the ions with a controlled few-cycle laser field(2) and then probe them through the spectrally resolved absorption of an attosecond extreme-ultraviolet pulse(3), which allows us to observe in real time the subfemtosecond motion of valence electrons over a multifemtosecond time span. We are able to completely characterize the quantum mechanical electron motion and determine its degree of coherence in the specimen of the ensemble. Although the present study uses a simple, prototypical open system, attosecond transient absorption spectroscopy should be applicable to molecules and solid-state materials to reveal the elementary electron motions that control physical, chemical and biological properties and processes.","[Goulielmakis, Eleftherios; Wirth, Adrian; Yakovlev, Vladislav S.; Zherebtsov, Sergey; Kling, Matthias F.; Krausz, Ferenc] Max Planck Inst Quantum Opt, D-85748 Garching, Germany; [Loh, Zhi-Heng; Pfeifer, Thomas; Leone, Stephen R.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Chem, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Loh, Zhi-Heng; Pfeifer, Thomas; Leone, Stephen R.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Phys, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Loh, Zhi-Heng; Pfeifer, Thomas; Leone, Stephen R.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Lawrence Berkeley Lab, Div Chem Sci, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Santra, Robin] Argonne Natl Lab, Argonne, IL 60439 USA; [Santra, Robin] Univ Chicago, Dept Phys, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Rohringer, Nina] Lawrence Livermore Natl Lab, Livermore, CA 94551 USA; [Yakovlev, Vladislav S.; Krausz, Ferenc] Univ Munich, Dept Phys, D-85748 Garching, Germany; [Azzeer, Abdallah M.] King Saud Univ, Dept Phys & Astron, Riyadh 11451, Saudi Arabia","Goulielmakis, E (reprint author), Max Planck Inst Quantum Opt, Hans Kopfermann Str 1, D-85748 Garching, Germany.",elgo@mpq.mpg.de; srl@berkeley.edu; krausz@lmu.de,"Azzeer, Abdallah/A-4542-2011; Loh, Zhi-Heng/B-6952-2011; Goulielmakis, Eleftherios/F-1693-2011; Rohringer, Nina/B-8030-2012; Kling, Matthias/D-3742-2014; Santra, Robin/E-8332-2014; Rohringer, Nina/N-3238-2014; Yakovlev, Vladislav/C-4091-2015","Azzeer, Abdallah/0000-0001-8334-9256; Loh, Zhi-Heng/0000-0001-9729-9632; Goulielmakis, Eleftherios/0000-0003-3386-0245; Santra, Robin/0000-0002-1442-9815; Rohringer, Nina/0000-0001-7905-3567; Yakovlev, Vladislav/0000-0002-0648-9375","Max Planck Society; King Saud University; DFG Cluster of Excellence: Munich Centre for Advanced Photonics; Marie-Curie Reintegration grant [MERG-CT-2007-208643]; DFG; Air Force Office of Scientific Research [FA9550-04-1-0242]; National Science Foundation [CHE-0742662, EEC-0310717]; Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, US Department of Energy [DE-AC02-05-CH11231, DE-AC02-06CH11357]; MPG; US Department of Energy, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory [DE-AC52-07NA27344]","We thank U.

This 250-km-thick layer has been interpreted as a stably stratified region of reduced composition in light elements(13). Here we show that this layer can be generated by simultaneous crystallization and melting at the surface of the inner core, and that a translational mode of thermal convection in the inner core can produce enough melting and crystallization on each hemisphere respectively for the dense layer to develop. The dynamical model we propose introduces a clear asymmetry between a melting and a crystallizing hemisphere which forms a basis for also explaining the East-West asymmetry. The present translation rate is found to be typically 100 million years for the inner core to be entirely renewed, which is one to two orders of magnitude faster than the growth rate of the inner core's radius. The resulting strong asymmetry of buoyancy flux caused by light elements is anticipated to have an impact on the dynamics of the outer core and on the geodynamo.","[Alboussiere, Thierry; Deguen, Renaud; Melzani, Mickael] Univ Grenoble 1, CNRS, Observ Grenoble, Lab Geophys Interne & Tectonophys, F-38041 Grenoble 9, France; [Alboussiere, Thierry] UCB Lyon 1, UMR5570, CNRS, F-69622 Villeurbanne, France; [Alboussiere, Thierry] Univ Lyon 1, ENS Lyon, F-69622 Villeurbanne, France; [Deguen, Renaud] Johns Hopkins Univ, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA","Alboussiere, T (reprint author), Univ Grenoble 1, CNRS, Observ Grenoble, Lab Geophys Interne & Tectonophys, BP 53, F-38041 Grenoble 9, France.",thierry.alboussiere@ens-lyon.fr,"Alboussiere, Thierry/C-8171-2012; Deguen, Renaud/H-2225-2014",,LGIT; ANR (Agence Nationale de la Recherche) [ANR-08-BLAN-0234-01],This work has benefited from discussions during the CNRS-INSU SEDIT meetings.

Here we report the discovery of a new species of Cretaceous notosuchian crocodyliform from the Rukwa Rift Basin(6) of southwestern Tanzania. This small-bodied form deviates significantly from more typical crocodyliform craniodental morphologies, having a short, broad skull, robust lower jaw, and a dentition with relatively few teeth that nonetheless show marked heterodonty. The presence of morphologically complex, complementary upper and lower molariform teeth suggests a degree of crown-crown contact during jaw adduction that is unmatched among known crocodyliforms, paralleling the level of occlusal complexity seen in mammals and their extinct relatives(7-12). The presence of another small-bodied mammal-like crocodyliform in the Cretaceous of Gondwana indicates that notosuchians probably filled niches and inhabited ecomorphospace that were otherwise occupied by mammals on northern continents.","[O'Connor, Patrick M.; Stevens, Nancy J.; Ridgely, Ryan] Ohio Univ, Coll Osteopath Med, Dept Biomed Sci, Athens, OH 45701 USA; [O'Connor, Patrick M.; Stevens, Nancy J.] Ohio Univ, Ohio Ctr Ecol & Evolutionary Studies, Athens, OH 45701 USA; [Sertich, Joseph J.

Although previous studies in forested ecosystems have documented patterns consistent with the process of negative feedback(7-16), these studies are unable to address which classes of enemies (for example, pathogens, invertebrates, mammals) exhibit species-specific effects strong enough to generate negative feedback(17), and whether negative feedback at the level of the individual tree is sufficient to influence community-wide forest composition. Here we use fully reciprocal shade-house and field experiments to test whether the performance of conspecific tree seedlings (relative to heterospecific seedlings) is reduced when grown in the presence of enemies associated with adult trees. Both experiments provide strong evidence for negative plant-soil feedback mediated by soil biota. In contrast, above-ground enemies (mammals, foliar herbivores and foliar pathogens) contributed little to negative feedback observed in the field. In both experiments, we found that tree species that showed stronger negative feedback were less common as adults in the forest community, indicating that susceptibility to soil biota may determine species relative abundance in these tropical forests. Finally, our simulation models confirm that the strength of local negative feedback that we measured is sufficient to produce the observed community-wide patterns in tree-species relative abundance. Our findings indicate that plant-soil feedback is an important mechanism that can maintain species diversity and explain patterns of tree-species relative abundance in tropical forests.","[Mangan, Scott A.; Schnitzer, Stefan A.] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Biol Sci, Milwaukee, WI 53201 USA; [Mangan, Scott A.; Schnitzer, Stefan A.; Herre, Edward A.; Sanchez, Evelyn I.] Smithsonian Trop Res Inst, MRC 0580 06, Dpo, AA 34002 USA; [Mack, Keenan M.

Simple image-and text-recognition tasks have been successfully 'crowd-sourced' through games(1-3), but it is not clear if more complex scientific problems can be solved with human-directed computing. Protein structure prediction is one such problem: locating the biologically relevant native conformation of a protein is a formidable computational challenge given the very large size of the search space. Here we describe Foldit, a multiplayer online game that engages non-scientists in solving hard prediction problems. Foldit players interact with protein structures using direct manipulation tools and user-friendly versions of algorithms from the Rosetta structure prediction methodology(4), while they compete and collaborate to optimize the computed energy. We show that top-ranked Foldit players excel at solving challenging structure refinement problems in which substantial backbone rearrangements are necessary to achieve the burial of hydrophobic residues. Players working collaboratively develop a rich assortment of new strategies and algorithms; unlike computational approaches, they explore not only the conformational space but also the space of possible search strategies. The integration of human visual problem-solving and strategy development capabilities with traditional computational algorithms through interactive multiplayer games is a powerful new approach to solving computationally-limited scientific problems.","[Cooper, Seth; Treuille, Adrien; Barbero, Janos; Beenen, Michael; Popovic, Zoran] Univ Washington, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Khatib, Firas; Leaver-Fay, Andrew; Baker, David] Univ Washington, Dept Biochem, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Treuille, Adrien; Lee, Jeehyung] Carnegie Mellon Univ, Sch Comp Sci, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA; [Baker, David] Univ Washington, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Seattle, WA 98195 USA","Popovic, Z (reprint author), Univ Washington, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Box 352350, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.",dabaker@u.washington.edu; zoran@cs.washington.edu,"Baker, David/K-8941-2012","Baker, David/0000-0001-7896-6217","NSF [IIS0811902, 0906026]; DARPA [N00173-08-1-G025]; Howard Hughes Medical Institute; Microsoft; NVIDIA Fellowship","We thank D.

One crucial step when studying the structure and dynamics of networks is to identify communities(4,5): groups of related nodes that correspond to functional subunits such as protein complexes(6,7) or social spheres(8-10). Communities in networks often overlap(9,10) such that nodes simultaneously belong to several groups. Meanwhile, many networks are known to possess hierarchical organization, where communities are recursively grouped into a hierarchical structure(11-13). However, the fact that many real networks have communities with pervasive overlap, where each and every node belongs to more than one group, has the consequence that a global hierarchy of nodes cannot capture the relationships between overlapping groups. Here we reinvent communities as groups of links rather than nodes and show that this unorthodox approach successfully reconciles the antagonistic organizing principles of overlapping communities and hierarchy. In contrast to the existing literature, which has entirely focused on grouping nodes, link communities naturally incorporate overlap while revealing hierarchical organization. We find relevant link communities in many networks, including major biological networks such as protein-protein interaction(6,7,14) and metabolic networks(11,15,16), and show that a large social network(10,17,18) contains hierarchically organized community structures spanning inner-city to regional scales while maintaining pervasive overlap. Our results imply that link communities are fundamental building blocks that reveal overlap and hierarchical organization in networks to be two aspects of the same phenomenon.","[Lehmann, Sune] Harvard Univ, Inst Quantitat Social Sci, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Ahn, Yong-Yeol; Bagrow, James P.] Northeastern Univ, Dept Phys, Ctr Complex Network Res, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Ahn, Yong-Yeol; Bagrow, James P.] Harvard Univ, Dana Farber Canc Inst, Ctr Canc Syst Biol, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Lehmann, Sune] Northeastern Univ, Coll Comp & Informat Sci, Boston, MA 02115 USA","Lehmann, S (reprint author), Harvard Univ, Inst Quantitat Social Sci, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",sune.lehmann@gmail.com,,"Lehmann, Sune/0000-0001-6099-2345; Ahn, Yong-Yeol/0000-0002-4352-4301","James S.

Here we have used mouse models of CML(2,3) to show that disease progression is regulated by the Musashi-Numb signalling axis(4,5). Specifically, we find that the chronic phase is marked by high levels of Numb expression whereas the blast crisis phase has low levels of Numb expression, and that ectopic expression of Numb promotes differentiation and impairs advanced-phase disease in vivo. As a possible explanation for the decreased levels of Numb in the blast crisis phase, we show that NUP98-HOXA9, an oncogene associated with blast crisis CML(6,7), can trigger expression of the RNA-binding protein Musashi2 (Msi2), which in turn represses Numb. Notably, loss of Msi2 restores Numb expression and significantly impairs the development and propagation of blast crisis CML in vitro and in vivo. Finally we show that Msi2 expression is not only highly upregulated during human CML progression but is also an early indicator of poorer prognosis. These data show that the Musashi-Numb pathway can control the differentiation of CML cells, and raise the possibility that targeting this pathway may provide a new strategy for the therapy of aggressive leukaemias.","[Ito, Takahiro; Kwon, Hyog Young; Zimdahl, Bryan; Congdon, Kendra L.; Blum, Jordan; Lento, William E.; Zhao, Chen; Reya, Tannishtha] Duke Univ, Med Ctr, Dept Pharmacol & Canc Biol, Durham, NC 27710 USA; [Lagoo, Anand] Duke Univ, Med Ctr, Dept Pathol, Durham, NC 27710 USA; [Gerrard, Gareth; Foroni, Letizia; Goldman, John] Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Hammersmith Hosp, Dept Haematol, London W12 0NN, England; [Goh, Harriet; Kim, Soo-Hyun; Kim, Dong-Wook] Catholic Univ Korea, Seoul St Marys Hosp, Div Hematol, Seoul, South Korea; [Chuah, Charles] Duke NUS Grad Med Sch, Canc & Stem Cell Biol Program, Singapore Gen Hosp, Dept Haematol, Singapore, Singapore; [Oehler, Vivian G.; Radich, Jerald P.] Fred Hutchinson Canc Res Ctr, Div Clin Res, Seattle, WA 98109 USA; [Jordan, Craig T.] Univ Rochester, Sch Med, James P Wilmot Canc Ctr, Rochester, NY 14642 USA","Reya, T (reprint author), Duke Univ, Med Ctr, Dept Pharmacol & Canc Biol, Durham, NC 27710 USA.",t.reya@duke.edu,"Ito, Takahiro/F-5006-2011","Gerrard, Gareth/0000-0002-4614-227X","Astellas Foundation for Research on Metabolic Disorders; American Heart Association; Leukemia and Lymphoma Society; ASH; NIH [CA18029, CA140371, CA122206, DK63031, DK072234, AI067798, HL097767, DP1OD006430]; Alexander and Margaret Stewart Fund; Lisa Stafford Research Prize;  [T32 GM007184-33]","We thank A.

L1s can retrotranspose in the germline, during early development and in select somatic cells(3-8); however, the host response to L1 retrotransposition remains largely unexplored. Here we show that reporter genes introduced into the genome of various human embryonic carcinoma-derived cell lines (ECs) by L1 retrotransposition are rapidly and efficiently silenced either during or immediately after their integration. Treating ECs with histone deacetylase inhibitors rapidly reverses this silencing, and chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments revealed that reactivation of the reporter gene was correlated with changes in chromatin status at the L1 integration site. Under our assay conditions, rapid silencing was also observed when reporter genes were delivered into ECs by mouse L1s and a zebrafish LINE-2 element, but not when similar reporter genes were delivered into ECs by Moloney murine leukaemia virus or human immunodeficiency virus, suggesting that these integration events are silenced by distinct mechanisms. Finally, we demonstrate that subjecting ECs to culture conditions that promote differentiation attenuates the silencing of reporter genes delivered by L1 retrotransposition, but that differentiation, in itself, is not sufficient to reactivate previously silenced reporter genes. Thus, our data indicate that ECs differ from many differentiated cells in their ability to silence reporter genes delivered by L1 retrotransposition.","[Garcia-Perez, Jose L.; Moran, John V.] Univ Michigan, Sch Med, Dept Human Genet, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Garcia-Perez, Jose L.; Morell, Maria; Morell, Santiago; Menendez, Pablo] Univ Granada, Ctr Biomed Res, Consejeria Salud Junta Andalucia, Andalusian Stem Cell Bank, Granada 18100, Spain; [Morell, Maria; Hammer, Gary D.; O'Shea, K.

The protozoan intracellular malaria parasites (Plasmodium spp.), however, have long been suspected of possessing a significantly streamlined carbon metabolic network in which tricarboxylic acid metabolism plays a minor role(2). Blood-stage Plasmodium parasites rely almost entirely on glucose fermentation for energy and consume minimal amounts of oxygen(3), yet the parasite genome encodes all of the enzymes necessary for a complete tricarboxylic acid cycle(4). Here, by tracing (13)C-labelled compounds using mass spectrometry(5), we show that tricarboxylic acid metabolism in the human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum is largely disconnected from glycolysis and is organized along a fundamentally different architecture from the canonical textbook pathway. We find that this pathway is not cyclic, but rather is a branched structure in which the major carbon sources are the amino acids glutamate and glutamine. As a consequence of this branched architecture, several reactions must run in the reverse of the standard direction, thereby generating two-carbon units in the form of acetyl-coenzyme A. We further show that glutamine-derived acetyl-coenzyme A is used for histone acetylation, whereas glucose-derived acetyl-coenzyme A is used to acetylate amino sugars. Thus, the parasite has evolved two independent production mechanisms for acetyl-coenzyme A with different biological functions. These results significantly clarify our understanding of the Plasmodium metabolic network and highlight the ability of altered variants of central carbon metabolism to arise in response to unique environments.","[Olszewski, Kellen L.; Llinas, Manuel] Princeton Univ, Dept Mol Biol, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Olszewski, Kellen L.; Rabinowitz, Joshua D.; Llinas, Manuel] Princeton Univ, Lewis Sigler Inst Integrat Gen, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Mather, Michael W.; Morrisey, Joanne M.; Vaidya, Akhil B.] Drexel Univ, Coll Med, Ctr Mol Parasitol, Philadelphia, PA 19129 USA; [Garcia, Benjamin A.] Princeton Univ, Dept Mol Biol, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Rabinowitz, Joshua D.] Princeton Univ, Dept Chem, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA","Llinas, M (reprint author), Princeton Univ, Dept Mol Biol, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA.",manuel@genomics.princeton.edu,,,"Burroughs Wellcome Fund; NIH [1DP2OD001315-01, R01 AI078063]; Beckman Young Investigators award; NSF [CBET-0941143]; Center for Quantitative Biology [P50 GM071508]; NIAID, NIH [AI028398]","We thank G.

Consequently, metalloproteins have key roles in most biological processes, including respiration (iron and copper), photosynthesis (manganese) and drug metabolism (iron). Yet, predicting from genome sequence the numbers and types of metal an organism assimilates from its environment or uses in its metalloproteome is currently impossible because metal coordination sites are diverse and poorly recognized(2-4). We present here a robust, metal-based approach to determine all metals an organism assimilates and identify its metalloproteins on a genome-wide scale. This shifts the focus from classical protein-based purification to metal-based identification and purification by liquid chromatography, high-throughput tandem mass spectrometry (HT-MS/MS) and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) to characterize cytoplasmic metalloproteins from an exemplary microorganism (Pyrococcus furiosus). Of 343 metal peaks in chromatography fractions, 158 did not match any predicted metalloprotein. Unassigned peaks included metals known to be used (cobalt, iron, nickel, tungsten and zinc; 83 peaks) plus metals the organism was not thought to assimilate (lead, manganese, molybdenum, uranium and vanadium; 75 peaks). Purification of eight of 158 unexpected metal peaks yielded four novel nickel- and molybdenum-containing proteins, whereas four purified proteins contained sub-stoichiometric amounts of misincorporated lead and uranium. Analyses of two additional microorganisms (Escherichia coli and Sulfolobus solfataricus) revealed species-specific assimilation of yet more unexpected metals. Metalloproteomes are therefore much more extensive and diverse than previously recognized, and promise to provide key insights for cell biology, microbial growth and toxicity mechanisms.","[Cvetkovic, Aleksandar; Menon, Angeli Lal; Thorgersen, Michael P.; Scott, Joseph W.; Poole, Farris L., II; Jenney, Francis E., Jr.; Lancaster, W.

For some particle-hole conjugate states of the fractional regime (for example, with fillings between 1/2 and 1 of the lowest Landau level), early predictions suggested the presence of counter-propagating edge currents in addition to the expected ones. When this did not agree with the measured conductance, it was suggested that disorder and interactions will lead to counter-propagating modes that carry only energy-the so called neutral modes. In addition, a neutral upstream mode (the Majorana mode) was expected for selected wavefunctions proposed for the even-denominator filling 5/2. Here we report the direct observation of counter-propagating neutral modes for fillings of 2/3, 3/5 and 5/2. The basis of our approach is that, if such modes impinge on a narrow constriction, the neutral quasiparticles will be partly reflected and fragmented into charge carriers, which can be detected through shot noise measurements. We find that the resultant shot noise is proportional to the injected current. Moreover, when we simultaneously inject a charge mode, the presence of the neutral mode was found to significantly affect the Fano factor and the temperature of the backscattered charge mode. In particular, such observations for filling 5/2 may single out the non-Abelian wavefunctions for the state.","[Bid, Aveek; Ofek, N.; Inoue, H.; Heiblum, M.; Umansky, V.; Mahalu, D.] Weizmann Inst Sci, Dept Condensed Matter Phys, Braun Ctr Submicron Res, IL-76100 Rehovot, Israel; [Kane, C.

Analyses of satellite-derived phytoplankton concentration (available since 1979) have suggested decadal-scale fluctuations linked to climate forcing, but the length of this record is insufficient to resolve longer-term trends. Here we combine available ocean transparency measurements and in situ chlorophyll observations to estimate the time dependence of phytoplankton biomass at local, regional and global scales since 1899. We observe declines in eight out of ten ocean regions, and estimate a global rate of decline of similar to 1% of the global median per year. Our analyses further reveal interannual to decadal phytoplankton fluctuations superimposed on long-term trends. These fluctuations are strongly correlated with basin-scale climate indices, whereas long-term declining trends are related to increasing sea surface temperatures. We conclude that global phytoplankton concentration has declined over the past century; this decline will need to be considered in future studies of marine ecosystems, geochemical cycling, ocean circulation and fisheries.","[Boyce, Daniel G.; Worm, Boris] Dalhousie Univ, Dept Biol, Halifax, NS B3H 4J1, Canada; [Lewis, Marlon R.] Dalhousie Univ, Dept Oceanog, Halifax, NS B3H 4J1, Canada","Boyce, DG (reprint author), Dalhousie Univ, Dept Biol, Halifax, NS B3H 4J1, Canada.",dboyce@dal.ca,,,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; US Office of Naval Research; Canada Foundation for Climate and Atmospheric Sciences; National Aeronautics and Space Administration; Sloan Foundation; Lenfest Ocean Program,"We are grateful to all data providers, to J.

Typically, during the transition the relative strength of two competing terms in the system's Hamiltonian changes across a finite critical value. A well-known example is the Mott-Hubbard quantum phase transition from a superfluid to an insulating phase(2,3), which has been observed for weakly interacting bosonic atomic gases. However, for strongly interacting quantum systems confined to lower-dimensional geometry, a novel type(4,5) of quantum phase transition may be induced and driven by an arbitrarily weak perturbation to the Hamiltonian. Here we observe such an effect-the sine-Gordon quantum phase transition from a superfluid Luttinger liquid to a Mott insulator(6,7)-in a one-dimensional quantum gas of bosonic caesium atoms with tunable interactions. For sufficiently strong interactions, the transition is induced by adding an arbitrarily weak optical lattice commensurate with the atomic granularity, which leads to immediate pinning of the atoms. We map out the phase diagram and find that our measurements in the strongly interacting regime agree well with a quantum field description based on the exactly solvable sine-Gordon model(8). We trace the phase boundary all the way to the weakly interacting regime, where we find good agreement with the predictions of the one-dimensional Bose-Hubbard model. Our results open up the experimental study of quantum phase transitions, criticality and transport phenomena beyond Hubbard-type models in the context of ultracold gases.","[Haller, Elmar; Hart, Russell; Mark, Manfred J.; Danzl, Johann G.; Reichsoellner, Lukas; Gustavsson, Mattias; Naegerl, Hanns-Christoph] Univ Innsbruck, Inst Expt Phys, A-6020 Innsbruck, Austria; [Haller, Elmar; Hart, Russell; Mark, Manfred J.; Danzl, Johann G.; Reichsoellner, Lukas; Gustavsson, Mattias; Naegerl, Hanns-Christoph] Univ Innsbruck, Zentrum Quantenphys, A-6020 Innsbruck, Austria; [Dalmonte, Marcello; Pupillo, Guido] Univ Innsbruck, Inst Theoret Phys, A-6020 Innsbruck, Austria; [Dalmonte, Marcello; Pupillo, Guido] Austrian Acad Sci, Inst Quantenopt & Quanteninformat, A-6020 Innsbruck, Austria; [Dalmonte, Marcello] Univ Bologna, Dipartimento Fis, I-40127 Bologna, Italy; [Dalmonte, Marcello] Ist Nazl Fis Nucl, I-40127 Bologna, Italy","Nagerl, HC (reprint author), Univ Innsbruck, Inst Expt Phys, Tech Str 25, A-6020 Innsbruck, Austria.",christoph.naegerl@uibk.ac.at,"Naegerl, Hanns-Christoph/E-7329-2010; Haller, Elmar/E-8916-2010; Gustavsson, Mattias/A-3397-2009; Mark, Manfred/E-4286-2010; Danzl, Johann/N-9987-2015","Naegerl, Hanns-Christoph/0000-0002-7789-4431; Mark, Manfred/0000-0001-8157-4716; Danzl, Johann/0000-0001-8559-3973",Austrian Ministry of Science and Research (Bundesministerium fur Wissenschaft und Forschung); Austrian Science Fund (Fonds zur Forderung der wissenschaftlichen Forschung); European Union [FP7-ICT-2007-C]; Marie Curie International Incoming Fellowship,"We thank W.

The most widespread technique for creating these quantum resources is spontaneous parametric down-conversion of laser light into photon pairs(1). Conservation of energy and momentum in this process, known as phase-matching, gives rise to strong correlations that are used to produce two-photon entanglement in various degrees of freedom(2-9). It has been a longstanding goal in quantum optics to realize a source that can produce analogous correlations in photon triplets, but of the many approaches considered, none has been technically feasible(10-17). Here we report the observation of photon triplets generated by cascaded down-conversion. Each triplet originates from a single pump photon, and therefore quantum correlations will extend over all three photons(18) in a way not achievable with independently created photon pairs(19). Our photon-triplet source will allow experimental interrogation of novel quantum correlations(20), the generation of tripartite entanglement(12,21) without post-selection and the generation of heralded entangled photon pairs suitable for linear optical quantum computing(22). Two of the triplet photons have a wavelength matched for optimal transmission in optical fibres, suitable for three-party quantum communication(23). Furthermore, our results open interesting regimes of non-linear optics, as we observe spontaneous down-conversion pumped by single photons, an interaction also highly relevant to optical quantum computing.","[Huebel, Hannes; Hamel, Deny R.; Resch, Kevin J.; Jennewein, Thomas] Univ Waterloo, Inst Quantum Comp, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada; [Huebel, Hannes; Hamel, Deny R.; Resch, Kevin J.; Jennewein, Thomas] Univ Waterloo, Dept Phys & Astron, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada; [Fedrizzi, Alessandro] Univ Queensland, Dept Phys, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia; [Fedrizzi, Alessandro] Univ Queensland, Ctr Quantum Comp Technol, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia; [Ramelow, Sven] Austrian Acad Sci, Inst Quantum Opt & Quantum Informat, A-1090 Vienna, Austria; [Ramelow, Sven] Univ Vienna, Fac Phys, A-1090 Vienna, Austria","Hubel, H (reprint author), Univ Waterloo, Inst Quantum Comp, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada.",hhuebel@iqc.ca; tjennewe@iqc.ca,"Fedrizzi, Alessandro/E-2888-2010; Ramelow, Sven/H-6798-2012; Hamel, Deny/C-7071-2017","Fedrizzi, Alessandro/0000-0002-5089-3148; Ramelow, Sven/0000-0002-7801-4440; Hamel, Deny/0000-0002-4788-7548",Canadian Institute for Advanced Research; Ontario Centres of Excellence; Ontario Ministry of Research and Innovation; Natural Sciences and Engineering Council of Canada; Canadian Foundation for Innovation; FWF (CoQus),"The authors would like to thank H.

The ultrashort pump pulse can excite only a small fraction of molecules, and the probe wavelength must be carefully chosen to discriminate between excited and unexcited molecules. The past decade has seen the emergence of new methods that are also aimed at imaging chemical reactions as they occur, based on X-ray diffraction(1), electron diffraction(2) or laser-induced recollision(3,4)-with spectral selection not available for any of these new methods. Here we show that in the case of high-harmonic spectroscopy based on recollision, this apparent limitation becomes a major advantage owing to the coherent nature of the attosecond high-harmonic pulse generation. The coherence allows the unexcited molecules to act as local oscillators against which the dynamics are observed, so a transient grating technique(5,6) can be used to reconstruct the amplitude and phase of emission from the excited molecules. We then extract structural information from the amplitude, which encodes the internuclear separation, by quantum interference at short times and by scattering of the recollision electron at longer times. The phase records the attosecond dynamics of the electrons, giving access to the evolving ionization potentials and the electronic structure of the transient molecule. In our experiment, we are able to document a temporal shift of the high-harmonic field of less than an attosecond (1 as = 10(-18) s) between the stretched and compressed geometry of weakly vibrationally excited Br(2) in the electronic ground state. The ability to probe structural and electronic features, combined with high time resolution, make high-harmonic spectroscopy ideally suited to measuring coupled electronic and nuclear dynamics occurring in photochemical reactions and to characterizing the electronic structure of transition states.","[Woerner, H.

At plate margins, tectonic motions quickly reload earthquake ruptures, making the location of recent earthquakes and the average time between them consistent with the faults' geological, palaeoseismic and seismic histories. In contrast, what determines the activation of a particular mid-continental fault and controls the duration of its seismic activity remains poorly understood(1). Here we argue that the concentration of magnitude-7 or larger earthquakes in the New Madrid seismic zone of the central United States(2,3) since the end of the last ice age results from the recent, climate-controlled, erosional history of the northern Mississippi embayment. We show that the upward flexure of the lithosphere caused by unloading from river incision between 16,000 and 10,000 years ago caused a reduction of normal stresses in the upper crust sufficient to unclamp preexisting faults close to failure equilibrium. Models indicate that fault segments that have already ruptured are unlikely to fail again soon, but stress changes from sediment unloading and previous earthquakes may eventually be sufficient to bring to failure other nearby segments that have not yet ruptured.","[Calais, E.; Freed, A.

In birds, males are ZZ and females ZW. In mammals, males are XY and females XX. Like the mammalian XY pair, the avian ZW pair is believed to have evolved from autosomes, with most change occurring in the chromosomes found in only one sex-the W and Y chromosomes(1-5). By contrast, the sex chromosomes found in both sexes-the Z and X chromosomes-are assumed to have diverged little from their autosomal progenitors(2). Here we report findings that challenge this assumption for both the chicken Z chromosome and the human X chromosome. The chicken Z chromosome, which we sequenced essentially to completion, is less gene-dense than chicken autosomes but contains a massive tandem array containing hundreds of duplicated genes expressed in testes. A comprehensive comparison of the chicken Z chromosome with the finished sequence of the human X chromosome demonstrates that each evolved independently from different portions of the ancestral genome. Despite this independence, the chicken Z and human X chromosomes share features that distinguish them from autosomes: the acquisition and amplification of testis-expressed genes, and a low gene density resulting from an expansion of intergenic regions. These features were not present on the autosomes from which the Z and X chromosomes originated but were instead acquired during the evolution of Z and X as sex chromosomes. We conclude that the avian Z and mammalian X chromosomes followed convergent evolutionary trajectories, despite their evolving with opposite (female versus male) systems of heterogamety. More broadly, in birds and mammals, sex chromosome evolution involved not only gene loss in sex-specific chromosomes, but also marked expansion and gene acquisition in sex chromosomes common to males and females.","[Bellott, Daniel W.; Skaletsky, Helen; Pyntikova, Tatyana; Brown, Laura G.; Rozen, Steve; Page, David C.] MIT, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Whitehead Inst, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; [Bellott, Daniel W.; Skaletsky, Helen; Pyntikova, Tatyana; Brown, Laura G.; Rozen, Steve; Page, David C.] MIT, Dept Biol, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; [Mardis, Elaine R.; Graves, Tina; Kremitzki, Colin; Warren, Wesley C.; Wilson, Richard K.] Washington Univ, Sch Med, Genome Ctr, St Louis, MO 63108 USA","Page, DC (reprint author), MIT, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Whitehead Inst, 9 Cambridge Ctr, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA.",dcpage@wi.mit.edu,,"Rozen, Steven G./0000-0002-4288-0056",National Institutes of Health; Howard Hughes Medical Institute,"We thank E.

We analysed the scale-dependent structure of cortical interactions by using maximum entropy models(6-9) to characterize multiple-tetrode recordings from primary visual cortex of anaesthetized macaque monkeys (Macaca mulatta). We compared the properties of firing patterns among local clusters of neurons (<300 mm apart) with those of neurons separated by larger distances (600-2,500 mu m). Here we report that local firing patterns are distinctive: whereas multi-neuronal firing patterns at larger distances can be predicted by pairwise interactions, patterns within local clusters often show evidence of high-order correlations. Surprisingly, these local correlations are flexible and rapidly reorganized by visual input. Although they modestly reduce the amount of information that a cluster conveys, they also modify the format of this information, creating sparser codes by increasing the periods of total quiescence, and concentrating information into briefer periods of common activity. These results imply a hierarchical organization of neuronal correlations: simple pairwise correlations link neurons over scales of tens to hundreds of minicolumns, but on the scale of a few minicolumns, ensembles of neurons form complex subnetworks whose moment-to-moment effective connectivity is dynamically reorganized by the stimulus.","[Ohiorhenuan, Ifije E.; Mechler, Ferenc; Purpura, Keith P.; Schmid, Anita M.; Hu, Qin; Victor, Jonathan D.] Weill Cornell Med Coll, Dept Neurol & Neurosci, New York, NY 10065 USA","Ohiorhenuan, IE (reprint author), Weill Cornell Med Coll, Dept Neurol & Neurosci, New York, NY 10065 USA.",ifo2001@med.cornell.edu,"Victor, Jonathan/D-2931-2009",,"National Institutes of Health [EY19454, GM07739, EY09314]",We thank S.

Two parallel basal ganglia pathways have been described(4), and have been proposed to exert opposing influences on motor function(5-7). According to this classical model, activation of the 'direct' pathway facilitates movement and activation of the 'indirect' pathway inhibits movement. However, more recent anatomical and functional evidence has called into question the validity of this hypothesis(8-10). Because this model has never been empirically tested, the specific function of these circuits in behaving animals remains unknown. Here we report direct activation of basal ganglia circuitry in vivo, using optogenetic control(11-14) of direct-and indirect-pathway medium spiny projection neurons (MSNs), achieved through Cre-dependent viral expression of channelrhodopsin-2 in the striatum of bacterial artificial chromosome transgenic mice expressing Cre recombinase under control of regulatory elements for the dopamine D1 or D2 receptor. Bilateral excitation of indirect-pathway MSNs elicited a parkinsonian state, distinguished by increased freezing, bradykinesia and decreased locomotor initiations. In contrast, activation of direct-pathway MSNs reduced freezing and increased locomotion. In a mouse model of Parkinson's disease, direct-pathway activation completely rescued deficits in freezing, bradykinesia and locomotor initiation. Taken together, our findings establish a critical role for basal ganglia circuitry in the bidirectional regulation of motor behaviour and indicate that modulation of direct-pathway circuitry may represent an effective therapeutic strategy for ameliorating parkinsonian motor deficits.","[Kravitz, Alexxai V.; Freeze, Benjamin S.; Parker, Philip R.

During periods of feeding, pancreatic islets secrete insulin to maintain glucose homeostasis, and although rhythmic control of insulin release is recognized to be dysregulated in humans with diabetes(4), it is not known how the circadian clock may affect this process. Here we show that pancreatic islets possess self-sustained circadian gene and protein oscillations of the transcription factors CLOCK and BMAL1. The phase of oscillation of islet genes involved in growth, glucose metabolism and insulin signalling is delayed in circadian mutant mice, and both Clock(5,6) and Bmal1(7) (also called Arntl) mutants show impaired glucose tolerance, reduced insulin secretion and defects in size and proliferation of pancreatic islets that worsen with age. Clock disruption leads to transcriptome-wide alterations in the expression of islet genes involved in growth, survival and synaptic vesicle assembly. Notably, conditional ablation of the pancreatic clock causes diabetes mellitus due to defective beta-cell function at the very latest stage of stimulus-secretion coupling. These results demonstrate a role for the beta-cell clock in coordinating insulin secretion with the sleep-wake cycle, and reveal that ablation of the pancreatic clock can trigger the onset of diabetes mellitus.","[Marcheva, Biliana; Ramsey, Kathryn Moynihan; Kobayashi, Yumiko; Ivanova, Ganka; Omura, Chiaki; Bass, Joseph] Northwestern Univ, Dept Med, Feinberg Sch Med, Chicago, IL 60611 USA; [Marcheva, Biliana; Ramsey, Kathryn Moynihan; Buhr, Ethan D.; Kobayashi, Yumiko; Ko, Caroline H.; Ivanova, Ganka; Omura, Chiaki; Bass, Joseph] Northwestern Univ, Dept Neurobiol & Physiol, Evanston, IL 60208 USA; [Su, Hong; Wang, Xiaozhong] Northwestern Univ, Dept Biochem Mol Biol & Cell Biol, Evanston, IL 60208 USA; [Mo, Shelley] Northwestern Univ, Weinberg Coll Arts & Sci, Evanston, IL 60208 USA; [Vitaterna, Martha H.; Bass, Joseph] Northwestern Univ, Ctr Sleep & Circadian Biol, Evanston, IL 60208 USA; [Lopez, James P.; Philipson, Louis H.] Univ Chicago, Dept Med, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Bradfield, Christopher A.] Univ Wisconsin, Sch Med & Publ Hlth, McArdle Lab Canc Res, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Crosby, Seth D.] Washington Univ, Sch Med, Dept Genet, St Louis, MO 63108 USA; [JeBailey, Lellean] GeneGo Inc, St Joseph, MI 49085 USA; [Takahashi, Joseph S.] Univ Texas SW Med Ctr Dallas, Dept Neurosci, Dallas, TX 75390 USA; [Takahashi, Joseph S.] Univ Texas SW Med Ctr Dallas, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Dallas, TX 75390 USA","Bass, J (reprint author), Northwestern Univ, Dept Med, Feinberg Sch Med, Chicago, IL 60611 USA.",j-bass@northwestern.edu,"Takahashi, Joseph/E-8482-2012","Takahashi, Joseph/0000-0003-0384-8878",National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases; National Institutes of Health [R37-ES-005703]; Chicago Biomedical Consortium; Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation; National Institute of Mental Health,"We thank F.

We sought to decipher this heterogeneity by integrating matched genetic alterations and candidate cells of origin to generate accurate disease models. First, we identified subgroups of human ependymoma, a form of neural tumour that arises throughout the central nervous system (CNS). Subgroup-specific alterations included amplifications and homozygous deletions of genes not yet implicated in ependymoma. To select cellular compartments most likely to give rise to subgroups of ependymoma, we matched the transcriptomes of human tumours to those of mouse neural stem cells (NSCs), isolated from different regions of the CNS at different developmental stages, with an intact or deleted Ink4a/Arf locus (that encodes Cdkn2a and b). The transcriptome of human supratentorial ependymomas with amplified EPHB2 and deleted INK4A/ARF matched only that of embryonic cerebral Ink4a/Arf(-/-) NSCs. Notably, activation of Ephb2 signalling in these, but not other, NSCs generated the first mouse model of ependymoma, which is highly penetrant and accurately models the histology and transcriptome of one subgroup of human supratentorial tumour. Further, comparative analysis of matched mouse and human tumours revealed selective deregulation in the expression and copy number of genes that control synaptogenesis, pinpointing disruption of this pathway as a critical event in the production of this ependymoma subgroup. Our data demonstrate the power of cross-species genomics to meticulously match subgroup-specific driver mutations with cellular compartments to model and interrogate cancer subgroups.","[Johnson, Robert A.; Wright, Karen D.; Poppleton, Helen; Mohankumar, Kumarasamypet M.; White, Elsie; Eden, Christopher; Hogg, Twala; Atkinson, Jennifer; Kranenburg, Tanya A.; Gilbertson, Richard J.] St Jude Childrens Hosp, Dept Dev Neurobiol, Memphis, TN 38105 USA; [Wright, Karen D.; DeWire, Mariko; Gajjar, Amar; Gilbertson, Richard J.] St Jude Childrens Hosp, Dept Oncol, Memphis, TN 38105 USA; [Finkelstein, David; Neale, Geoffrey; Wang, Yong-Dong] St Jude Childrens Hosp, Hartwell Ctr Bioinformat & Biotechnol, Memphis, TN 38105 USA; [Pounds, Stanley B.] St Jude Childrens Hosp, Dept Biostat, Memphis, TN 38105 USA; [Rand, Vikki] Newcastle Univ, No Inst Canc Res, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE2 4HH, Tyne & Wear, England; [Leary, Sarah E.

The molecular mechanism of LRRK2 action is not known. Here we show that LRRK2 interacts with the microRNA (miRNA) pathway to regulate protein synthesis. Drosophila e2f1 and dp messenger RNAs are translationally repressed by let-7 and miR-184*, respectively. Pathogenic LRRK2 antagonizes these miRNAs, leading to the overproduction of E2F1/DP, previously implicated in cell cycle and survival control 3 and shown here to be critical for LRRK2 pathogenesis. Genetic deletion of let-7, antagomir-mediated blockage of let-7 and miR-184* action, transgenic expression of dp target protector, or replacement of endogenous dp with a dp transgene non-responsive to let-7 each had toxic effects similar to those of pathogenic LRRK2. Conversely, increasing the level of let-7 or miR-184* attenuated pathogenic LRRK2 effects. LRRK2 associated with Drosophila Argonaute-1 (dAgo1) or human Argonaute-2 (hAgo2) of the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC). In aged fly brain, dAgo1 protein level was negatively regulated by LRRK2. Further, pathogenic LRRK2 promoted the association of phospho-4E-BP1 with hAgo2. Our results implicate deregulated synthesis of E2F1/DP caused by the miRNA pathway impairment as a key event in LRRK2 pathogenesis and suggest novel miRNA-based therapeutic strategies.","[Gehrke, Stephan; Lu, Bingwei] Stanford Univ, Dept Pathol, Sch Med, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Imai, Yuzuru] Tohoku Univ, Inst Dev Aging & Canc, Sendai, Miyagi 9808575, Japan; [Sokol, Nicholas] Indiana Univ, Dept Biol, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA","Gehrke, S (reprint author), Stanford Univ, Dept Pathol, Sch Med, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",sgehrke@stanford.edu; bingwei@stanford.edu,"Sokol, Nicholas/K-2761-2012","Sokol, Nicholas/0000-0002-2768-4102","National Institutes of Health [R01AR054926, R01MH080378, R21NS056878]; McKnight Foundation; Beckman Foundation; Sloan Foundation; MEXT in Japan; Asahi Glass Foundation","We thank R.

Genetic and in vitro studies show that these RNAs are not merely degradation products of longer transcripts but could indeed have a function(1,2,5). Furthermore, profiling of RNAs, including the sRNAs, can reveal not only novel transcripts, but also make clear predictions about the existence and properties of novel biochemical pathways operating in a cell. For example, sRNA profiling in human cells indicated the existence of an unknown capping mechanism operating on cleaved RNA(2), a biochemical component of which was later identified(6). Here we show that human cells contain a novel type of sRNA that has non-genomically encoded 5' poly(U) tails. The presence of these RNAs at the termini of genes, specifically at the very 3' ends of known mRNAs, strongly argues for the presence of a yet uncharacterized endogenous biochemical pathway in cells that can copy RNA. We show that this pathway can operate on multiple genes, with specific enrichment towards transcript-encoding components of the translational machinery. Finally, we show that genes are also flanked by sense, 3' polyadenylated sRNAs that are likely to be capped.","[Kapranov, Philipp; Ozsolak, Fatih; Lipson, Doron; Hart, Chris; Roels, Steve; Milos, Patrice M.] Helicos BioSci Corp, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Kim, Sang Woo; John, Bino] Univ Pittsburgh, Sch Med, Dept Computat & Syst Biol, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA; [Foissac, Sylvain] Integromics SL, Madrid 28760, Spain; [Borel, Christelle; Antonarakis, Stylianos E.] Univ Geneva, Sch Med, Dept Genet Med & Dev, CH-1211 Geneva, Switzerland; [Monaghan, A.

If diffraction blurs the image of a point object into an Airy disk with a root-mean-squared (r.m.s.) size of s = 0.44 lambda/2NA (similar to 90 nm for light with a wavelength of lambda = 600 nm and an objective lens with a numerical aperture of NA = 1.49), limiting the resolution of the far-field microscope in use to d = 2.4s approximate to 200 nm, additional knowledge about the specimen can be used to great advantage. For example, if the source is known to be two spatially resolved fluorescent molecules, the distance between them is given by the separation of the centres of the two fluorescence images(1). In high-resolution microwave and optical spectroscopy, there are numerous examples where the line centre is determined with a precision of less than 10(-6) of the linewidth. In contrast, in biological applications the brightest single fluorescent emitters can be detected with a signal-to-noise ratio of similar to 100, limiting the centroid localization precision to s(loc) >= 1% (>= 1 nm) of the r.m.s. size, s, of the microscope point spread function (PSF)(2). Moreover, the error in co-localizing two or more single emitters is notably worse, remaining greater than 5-10% (5-10 nm) of the PSF size(3-8). Here we report a distance resolution of s(reg) = 0.50 nm (1 sigma) and an absolute accuracy of s(distance) = 0.77 nm (1 sigma) in a measurement of the separation between differently coloured fluorescent molecules using conventional far-field fluorescence imaging in physiological buffer conditions. The statistical uncertainty in the mean for an ensemble of identical single-molecule samples is limited only by the total number of collected photons, to s(loc) approximate to 0.3 nm, which is similar to 3 x 10(-3) times the size of the optical PSF. Our method may also be used to improve the resolution of many subwavelength, far-field imaging methods such as those based on co-localization of molecules that are stochastically switched on in space(6-8). The improved resolution will allow the structure of large, multisubunit biological complexes in biologically relevant environments to be deciphered at the single-molecule level.","[Pertsinidis, Alexandros; Zhang, Yunxiang; Chu, Steven] Stanford Univ, Dept Phys, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Pertsinidis, Alexandros; Zhang, Yunxiang; Chu, Steven] Univ Calif Berkeley, Calif Inst Quantitat Biosci QB3, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Chu, Steven] Univ Calif Berkeley, Lawrence Berkeley Lab, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Chu, Steven] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Phys, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Chu, Steven] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mol & Cell Biol, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA","Pertsinidis, A (reprint author), Stanford Univ, Dept Phys, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",pertsin@berkeley.edu; the.secretary@hq.doe.gov,,,National Institutes of Health; National Science Foundation; National Aeronautics and Space Administration; Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency,"A.P. wishes to thank S.

This results in phosphorylation of the nuclear receptor PPAR gamma (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor c), a dominant regulator of adipogenesis and fat cell gene expression, at serine 273. This modification of PPAR gamma does not alter its adipogenic capacity, but leads to dysregulation of a large number of genes whose expression is altered in obesity, including a reduction in the expression of the insulin-sensitizing adipokine, adiponectin. The phosphorylation of PPAR gamma by Cdk5 is blocked by anti-diabetic PPAR gamma ligands, such as rosiglitazone and MRL24. This inhibition works both in vivo and in vitro, and is completely independent of classical receptor transcriptional agonism. Similarly, inhibition of PPAR gamma phosphorylation in obese patients by rosiglitazone is very tightly associated with the anti-diabetic effects of this drug. All these findings strongly suggest that Cdk5-mediated phosphorylation of PPAR gamma may be involved in the pathogenesis of insulin-resistance, and present an opportunity for development of an improved generation of anti-diabetic drugs through PPAR gamma.","[Choi, Jang Hyun; Banks, Alexander S.; Estall, Jennifer L.; Kajimura, Shingo; Bostroem, Pontus; Laznik, Dina; Ruas, Jorge L.; Spiegelman, Bruce M.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dana Farber Canc Inst, Dept Canc Biol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Choi, Jang Hyun; Banks, Alexander S.; Estall, Jennifer L.; Kajimura, Shingo; Bostroem, Pontus; Laznik, Dina; Ruas, Jorge L.; Spiegelman, Bruce M.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dana Farber Canc Inst, Div Metab & Chron Dis, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Choi, Jang Hyun; Banks, Alexander S.; Estall, Jennifer L.; Kajimura, Shingo; Bostroem, Pontus; Laznik, Dina; Ruas, Jorge L.; Spiegelman, Bruce M.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Cell Biol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Chalmers, Michael J.; Kamenecka, Theodore M.; Griffin, Patrick R.] Scripps Res Inst, Dept Mol Therapeut, Jupiter, FL 33458 USA; [Blueher, Matthias] Univ Leipzig, Dept Med, Leipzig, Germany","Spiegelman, BM (reprint author), Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dana Farber Canc Inst, Dept Canc Biol, 44 Binney St, Boston, MA 02115 USA.",bruce_spiegelman@dfci.harvard.edu,"Choi, Jang Hyun/B-3055-2012; Banks, Alexander/B-4832-2012","Banks, Alexander/0000-0003-1787-6925; Ruas, Jorge/0000-0002-1110-2606","NIH [DK31405, DK087853]; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG); N National Institute of Mental Health [U54-MH084512]; NIH National Institute of General Medical Sciences [R01-GM084041]; Clinical Research group [KFO 152, BL 833/1-1]","We thank V.

Proper initiation and termination of each action sequence is critical for the organization of behaviour, and is compromised in nigrostriatal disorders like Parkinson's and Huntington's diseases. Using a self-paced operant task in which mice learn to perform a particular sequence of actions to obtain an outcome, we found neural activity in nigrostriatal circuits specifically signalling the initiation or the termination of each action sequence. This start/stop activity emerged during sequence learning, was specific for particular actions, and did not reflect interval timing, movement speed or action value. Furthermore, genetically altering the function of striatal circuits disrupted the development of start/stop activity and selectively impaired sequence learning. These results have important implications for understanding the functional organization of actions and the sequence initiation and termination impairments observed in basal ganglia disorders.","[Jin, Xin; Costa, Rui M.] NIAAA, Lab Integrat Neurosci, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Costa, Rui M.] Inst Gulbenkian Ciencias, Champalimaud Neurosci Programme, P-2780156 Oeiras, Portugal","Costa, RM (reprint author), NIAAA, Lab Integrat Neurosci, NIH, 5625 Fishers Lane, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA.",ruicosta@fchampalimaud.org,,"Costa, Rui/0000-0003-0495-8374",NIAAA Division of Intramural Clinical and Biological Research; Institute Gulbenkian de Ciencia; European Research Council [243393],"We thank Y.

Nevertheless, evidence for lunar explosive volcanism(4,5) has been used to infer that some lunar magmas exsolved a CO-rich and CO(2)-rich vapour phase before or during eruption(6-8). Although there is also evidence for other volatile species on glass spherules(9), until recently(10) there had been no unambiguous reports of indigenous H in lunar rocks. Here we report quantitative ion microprobe measurements of late-stage apatite from lunar basalt 14053 that document concentrations of H, Cl and S that are indistinguishable from apatites in common terrestrial igneous rocks. These volatile contents could reflect post-magmatic metamorphic volatile addition or growth from a late-stage, interstitial, sulphide-saturated melt that contained similar to 1,600 parts per million H(2)O and similar to 3,500 parts per million Cl. Both metamorphic and igneous models of apatite formation suggest a volatile inventory for at least some lunar materials that is similar to comparable terrestrial materials.

In particular, although the twodimensional parent material graphene(4,5) exhibits semimetallic behaviour, quantum confinement and edge effects(2,6) should render all graphene nanoribbons with widths smaller than 10 nm semiconducting. But exploring the potential of graphene nanoribbons is hampered by their limited availability: although they have been made using chemical(7-9), sonochemical(10) and lithographic(11,12) methods as well as through the unzipping of carbon nanotubes(13-16), the reliable production of graphene nanoribbons smaller than 10 nm with chemical precision remains a significant challenge. Here we report a simple method for the production of atomically precise graphene nanoribbons of different topologies and widths, which uses surface-assisted coupling(17,18) of molecular precursors into linear polyphenylenes and their subsequent cyclodehydrogenation(19,20). The topology, width and edge periphery of the graphene nanoribbon products are defined by the structure of the precursor monomers, which can be designed to give access to a wide range of different graphene nanoribbons. We expect that our bottom-up approach to the atomically precise fabrication of graphene nanoribbons will finally enable detailed experimental investigations of the properties of this exciting class of materials. It should even provide a route to graphene nanoribbon structures with engineered chemical and electronic properties, including the theoretically predicted intraribbon quantum dots(21), superlattice structures(22) and magnetic devices based on specific graphene nanoribbon edge states(3).","[Cai, Jinming; Ruffieux, Pascal; Jaafar, Rached; Bieri, Marco; Braun, Thomas; Blankenburg, Stephan; Fasel, Roman] Empa, Swiss Fed Labs Mat Sci & Technol, Nanotech Surfaces Lab, CH-3602 Thun, Switzerland; [Cai, Jinming; Ruffieux, Pascal; Jaafar, Rached; Bieri, Marco; Braun, Thomas; Blankenburg, Stephan; Fasel, Roman] Empa, Swiss Fed Labs Mat Sci & Technol, Nanotech Surfaces Lab, CH-8600 Dubendorf, Switzerland; [Muoth, Matthias] ETH, Dept Mech & Proc Engn Micro & Nanosyst, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland; [Seitsonen, Ari P.] Univ Zurich, Inst Phys Chem, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland; [Seitsonen, Ari P.] CNRS, IMPMC, F-75252 Paris, France; [Seitsonen, Ari P.] Univ Paris 06, F-75252 Paris, France; [Saleh, Moussa; Feng, Xinliang; Muellen, Klaus] Max Planck Inst Polymer Res, D-55124 Mainz, Germany; [Fasel, Roman] Univ Bern, Dept Chem & Biochem, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland","Fasel, R (reprint author), Empa, Swiss Fed Labs Mat Sci & Technol, Nanotech Surfaces Lab, CH-3602 Thun, Switzerland.",muellen@mpip-mainz.mpg.de; roman.fasel@empa.ch,"Ruffieux, Pascal/E-8227-2010; Fasel, Roman/B-5396-2011; Seitsonen, Ari/B-1552-2009","Ruffieux, Pascal/0000-0001-5729-5354; Fasel, Roman/0000-0002-1553-6487; Seitsonen, Ari/0000-0003-4331-0650","Swiss National Science Foundation; NCCR Nanoscale Science; Max Planck Society; German Science Foundation (Korean-German IRTG); DFG [SPP 1355, DFG MU 334/32-1]","This work was supported by the Swiss National Science Foundation and the NCCR Nanoscale Science.

In particular, co-assembly of two types of nanocrystal into binary nanocrystal superlattices (BNSLs) has recently attracted significant attention(2-8), as this provides a lowcost, programmable way to design metamaterials(4) with precisely controlled properties that arise from the organization and interactions of the constituent nanocrystal components(9). Although challenging, the ability to grow and manipulate large-scale BNSLs is critical for extensive exploration of this new class of material. Here we report a general method of growing centimetre-scale, uniform membranes of BNSLs that can readily be transferred to arbitrary substrates. Our method is based on the liquid-air interfacial assembly of multicomponent nanocrystals and circumvents the limitations associated with the current assembly strategies, allowing integration of BNSLs on any substrate for the fabrication of nanocrystal-based devices(10). We demonstrate the construction of magnetoresistive devices by incorporating large-area (1.5 mm x 32.5 mm) BNSL membranes; their magnetotransport measurements clearly show that device magnetoresistance is dependent onthe structure (stoichiometry) of the BNSLs. The ability to transfer BNSLs also allows the construction of free-standing membranes and other complex architectures that have not been accessible previously.","[Dong, Angang; Murray, Christopher B.] Univ Penn, Dept Chem, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Chen, Jun; Murray, Christopher B.] Univ Penn, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Vora, Patrick M.; Kikkawa, James M.] Univ Penn, Dept Phys & Astron, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA","Dong, AG (reprint author), Univ Penn, Dept Chem, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",angang@sas.upenn.edu; cbmurray@sas.upenn.edu,"Dong, Angang/C-5308-2014; Chen, Jun/F-7103-2014","Vora, Patrick/0000-0003-3967-8137; Dong, Angang/0000-0002-9677-8778",US Army Research Office (ARO) [MURI W911NF-08-1-0364]; NSF [DMR-0520020],"A.D. and C.B.M. acknowledge the financial support from the US Army Research Office (ARO) under award number MURI W911NF-08-1-0364.

Although the annual burial of organic carbon in lakes and reservoirs exceeds that of ocean sediments(3), these inland waters are components of the global carbon cycle that receive only limited attention(4-6). Of the organic carbon that is being deposited onto the sediments, a certain proportion will be mineralized and the remainder will be buried over geological timescales. Here we assess the relationship between sediment organic carbon mineralization and temperature in a cross-system survey of boreal lakes in Sweden, and with input froma compilation of published data from awide range of lakes that differ with respect to climate, productivity and organic carbon source. We find that the mineralization of organic carbon in lake sediments exhibits a strongly positive relationship with temperature, which suggests that warmer water temperatures lead to more mineralization and less organic carbon burial. Assuming that future organic carbon delivery to the lake sediments will be similar to that under present-day conditions, we estimate that temperature increases following the latest scenarios presented by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change(7) could result in a 4-27 per cent (0.9-6.4 Tg Cyr(-1)) decrease in annual organic carbon burial in boreal lakes.","[Gudasz, Cristian; Steger, Kristin; Premke, Katrin; Sobek, Sebastian; Tranvik, Lars J.] Uppsala Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolut, SE-75236 Uppsala, Sweden; [Bastviken, David] Linkoping Univ, Dept Themat Studies Water & Environm Studies, SE-58662 Linkoping, Sweden","Gudasz, C (reprint author), Uppsala Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolut, Norbyvagen 18D, SE-75236 Uppsala, Sweden.",cristian.gudasz@ebc.uu.se,"Tranvik, Lars/H-2222-2011; Steger, Kristin/F-4187-2014; Steger, Kristin/F-3000-2014","Steger, Kristin/0000-0001-6446-8022; Bastviken, David/0000-0003-0038-2152; Steger, Kristin/0000-0002-7737-0697","FORMAS (the Swedish Research Council for Environment, Agricultural Sciences and Spatial Planning); VR (the Swedish Research Council)","The study was part of the research environment LEREC (Lake Ecosystem Response to Environmental Change), financially supported by FORMAS (the Swedish Research Council for Environment, Agricultural Sciences and Spatial Planning).

However, the links underlying these joint responses remain largely unknown owing to a paucity of long-term data and the lack of an appropriate analytical framework(3). Here we investigate the link between phenotypic and demographic responses to environmental change using a new methodology and a long-term (1976-2008) data set from a hibernating mammal (the yellow-bellied marmot) inhabiting a dynamic subalpine habitat. We demonstrate how earlier emergence from hibernation and earlier weaning of young has led to a longer growing season and larger body masses before hibernation. The resulting shift in both the phenotype and the relationship between phenotype and fitness components led to a decline in adult mortality, which in turn triggered an abrupt increase in population size in recent years. Direct and trait-mediated effects of environmental change made comparable contributions to the observed marked increase in population growth. Our results help explain how a shift in phenology can cause simultaneous phenotypic and demographic changes, and highlight the need for a theory integrating ecological and evolutionary dynamics in stochastic environments(4,5).","[Ozgul, Arpat; Coulson, Tim] Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Dept Life Sci, Ascot SL5 7PY, Berks, England; [Childs, Dylan Z.] Univ Sheffield, Dept Anim & Plant Sci, Sheffield S10 2TN, S Yorkshire, England; [Oli, Madan K.] Univ Florida, Dept Wildlife Ecol & Conservat, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [Armitage, Kenneth B.] Univ Kansas, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA; [Blumstein, Daniel T.; Olson, Lucretia E.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Tuljapurkar, Shripad] Stanford Univ, Dept Biol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA","Ozgul, A (reprint author), Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Dept Life Sci, Ascot SL5 7PY, Berks, England.",a.ozgul@imperial.ac.uk,"Childs, Dylan/C-9814-2010; Blumstein, Daniel/B-6199-2012; Ozgul, Arpat/K-2032-2012","Ozgul, Arpat/0000-0001-7477-2642; Olson, Lucretia/0000-0002-5703-3351; Coulson, Tim/0000-0001-9371-9003; Blumstein, Daniel/0000-0001-5793-9244",NERC; Wellcome Trust; NSF; NIH; NIA,"We thank the 'marmoteers' who participated in collecting the long-term data, Rocky Mountain Biological Laboratory for providing the field facilities, B.

However, the genetic mechanisms by which pheromone signals change during the evolution of new species are largely unknown(4). In the sexual communication system of moths (Insecta: Lepidoptera), females emit a species-specific pheromone blend that attracts males over long distances(1,2,4). The European corn borer, Ostrinia nubilalis, consists of two sex pheromone races, Z and E, that use different ratios of the cis and trans isomers of acetate pheromone components(5). This subtle difference leads to strong reproductive isolation in the field between the two races(6,7), which could represent a first step in speciation. Female sex pheromone production and male behavioural response are under the control of different major genes(8,9), but the identity of these genes is unknown. Here we show that allelic variation in a fatty-acyl reductase gene essential for pheromone biosynthesis accounts for the phenotypic variation in female pheromone production, leading to race-specific signals. Both the cis and trans isomers of the pheromone precursors are produced by both races, but the precursors are differentially reduced to yield opposite ratios in the final pheromone blend as a result of the substrate specificity of the enzymes encoded by the Z and E alleles. This is the first functional characterization of a gene contributing to intraspecific behavioural reproductive isolation in moths, highlighting the importance of evolutionary diversification in a lepidopteran-specific family of reductases. Accumulation of substitutions in the coding region of a single biosynthetic enzyme can produce pheromone differences resulting in reproductive isolation, with speciation as a potential end result.","[Lassance, Jean-Marc; Lienard, Marjorie A.; Antony, Binu; Lofstedt, Christer] Lund Univ, Dept Biol, S-22362 Lund, Sweden; [Groot, Astrid T.; Borgwardt, Christin; Heckel, David G.] Max Planck Inst Chem Ecol, Dept Entomol, D-07745 Jena, Germany; [Andersson, Fredrik; Hedenstrom, Erik] Mid Sweden Univ, Dept Nat Sci Engn & Math, S-85170 Sundsvall, Sweden","Lassance, JM (reprint author), Lund Univ, Dept Biol, S-22362 Lund, Sweden.",jean-marc.lassance@ekol.lu.se; christer.lofstedt@ekol.lu.se,"Lofstedt, Christer/G-2016-2014; Groot, Astrid/A-8954-2013; Heckel, David/K-2138-2013","Lofstedt, Christer/0000-0002-3116-6922; Groot, Astrid/0000-0001-9595-0161; Heckel, David/0000-0001-8991-2150; Antony, Binu/0000-0002-6292-620X; Lassance, Jean-Marc/0000-0002-3675-6956","Swedish Research Council (VR); Swedish Research Council for Environment, Agricultural Sciences and Spatial Planning (FORMAS); Max-Planck-Gesellschaft","We thank R.G.

Recent reports have shown that developmental genes often possess multiple discrete enhancer modules that drive transcription in similar spatio-temporal patterns(1-4): primary enhancers located near the basal promoter and secondary, or 'shadow', enhancers located at more remote positions. It has been proposed that the seemingly redundant activity of primary and secondary enhancers contributes to phenotypic robustness(1,5). We tested this hypothesis by generating a deficiency that removes two newly discovered enhancers of shavenbaby (svb, a transcript of the ovo locus), a gene encoding a transcription factor that directs development of Drosophila larval trichomes(6). At optimal temperatures for embryonic development, this deficiency causes minor defects in trichome patterning. In embryos that develop at both low and high extreme temperatures, however, absence of these secondary enhancers leads to extensive loss of trichomes. These temperature-dependent defects can be rescued by a transgene carrying a secondary enhancer driving transcription of the svb cDNA. Finally, removal of one copy of wingless, a gene required for normal trichome patterning(7), causes a similar loss of trichomes only in flies lacking the secondary enhancers. These results support the hypothesis that secondary enhancers contribute to phenotypic robustness in the face of environmental and genetic variability.","[Frankel, Nicolas; Vargas, Diego; Wang, Shu; Stern, David L.] Princeton Univ, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Frankel, Nicolas; Vargas, Diego; Wang, Shu; Stern, David L.] Princeton Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Davis, Gregory K.] Bryn Mawr Coll, Dept Biol, Bryn Mawr, PA 19010 USA; [Payre, Francois] Univ Toulouse, F-31062 Toulouse, France; [Payre, Francois] CNRS, UMR5547, Ctr Dev Biol, F-31062 Toulouse, France","Stern, DL (reprint author), Princeton Univ, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA.",dstern@princeton.edu,"Phelps, Steve/H-2263-2011","PAYRE, Francois/0000-0002-8144-6711; Stern, David/0000-0002-1847-6483",Pew Charitable Trusts; Agence Nationale de la Recherche; NIH [GM063622-06A1]; NSF [IOS-0640339],"We thank D.

Developmental polyphenisms have been proposed to be facilitators of phenotypic evolution, but little is known about the interplay between the associated genetic and environmental factors(3-11). Here, we study two alternative morphologies in the mouth of the nematode Pristionchus pacificus and the formation of teeth-like structures that are associated with bacteriovorous feeding and predatory behaviour on fungi and other worms(12-16). These teeth-like denticles represent an evolutionary novelty, which is restricted to some members of the nematode family Diplogastridae but is absent from Caenorhabditis elegans and related nematodes(14). We show that the mouth dimorphism is a polyphenism that is controlled by starvation and the co-option of an endocrine switch mechanism. Mutations in the nuclear hormone receptor DAF-12 and application of its ligand, the sterol hormone dafachronic acid, strongly influence this switch mechanism. The dafachronic acid-DAF-12 module has been shown to control the formation of arrested dauer larvae in both C. elegans and P. pacificus, as well as related life-history decisions in distantly related nematodes(17-20). The comparison of dauer formation and mouth morphology switch reveals that different thresholds of dafachronic acid signalling provide specificity. This study shows how hormonal signalling acts by coupling environmental change and genetic regulation and identifies dafachronic acid as a key hormone in nematode evolution.","[Bento, Gilberto; Ogawa, Akira; Sommer, Ralf J.] Max Planck Inst Dev Biol, Dept Evolutionary Biol, D-72076 Tubingen, Germany","Sommer, RJ (reprint author), Max Planck Inst Dev Biol, Dept Evolutionary Biol, Spemannstr 37, D-72076 Tubingen, Germany.",ralf.sommer@tuebingen.mpg.de,,"Bento, Gilberto/0000-0002-8455-6625",,,,31,73,73,2,25,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,22-Jul,2010,466,7305,,,,,494,U9,,10.1038/nature09164,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,628SJ,WOS:000280141200037,20592728,No,,,11/20/17

In Caenorhabditis elegans, the single forkhead box O (FOXO) homologue, DAF-16, functions as the major target of the IIS pathway(2,3,6,7). One of two isoforms(4,5,8), DAF-16a, is known to regulate longevity, stress response and dauer diapause(8-11). However, it remains unclear how DAF-16 achieves its specificity in regulating these various biological processes. Here we identify a new isoform, DAF-16d/f, as an important isoform regulating longevity. We show that DAF-16 isoforms functionally cooperate to modulate IIS-mediated processes through differential tissue enrichment, preferential modulation by upstream kinases, and regulating distinct and overlapping target genes. Promoter-swapping experiments show both the promoter and the coding region of DAF-16 are important for its function. Importantly, in mammals, four FOXO genes have overlapping and different functions(6,12), and in C. elegans, a single FOXO/DAF-16 uses distinct isoforms to fine-tune the IIS-mediated processes in the context of a whole organism.","[Kwon, Eun-Soo; Narasimhan, Devi; Yen, Kelvin; Tissenbaum, Heidi A.] Univ Massachusetts, Sch Med, Program Gene Funct & Express, Worcester, MA 01605 USA; [Tissenbaum, Heidi A.] Univ Massachusetts, Sch Med, Program Mol Med, Worcester, MA 01605 USA","Tissenbaum, HA (reprint author), Univ Massachusetts, Sch Med, Program Gene Funct & Express, Worcester, MA 01605 USA.",heidi.tissenbaum@umassmed.edu,,"Yen, Kelvin/0000-0003-4595-971X","National Institutes of Health National Center for Research Resources; National Institute of Aging [AG025891, AG031237]; Glenn Foundation for Medical Research; Ellison Medical Foundation; William Randolph Hearst Foundation","We are grateful to A.

Causal mutations have been found in approximately 90 X-linked genes(2); however, molecular and biological functions of many of these genetically defined XLMR genes remain unknown. PHF8 (PHD (plant homeo domain) finger protein 8) is a JmjC domain-containing protein and its mutations have been found in patients with XLMR and craniofacial deformities. Here we provide multiple lines of evidence establishing PHF8 as the first mono-methyl histone H4 lysine 20 (H4K20me1) demethylase, with additional activities towards histone H3K9me1 and me2. PHF8 is located around the transcription start sites (TSS) of similar to 7,000 RefSeq genes and in gene bodies and intergenic regions (non-TSS). PHF8 depletion resulted in upregulation of H4K20me1 and H3K9me1 at the TSS and H3K9me2 in the non-TSS sites, respectively, demonstrating differential substrate specificities at different target locations. PHF8 positively regulates gene expression, which is dependent on its H3K4me3-binding PHD and catalytic domains. Importantly, patient mutations significantly compromised PHF8 catalytic function. PHF8 regulates cell survival in the zebrafish brain and jaw development, thus providing a potentially relevant biological context for understanding the clinical symptoms associated with PHF8 patients. Lastly, genetic and molecular evidence supports a model whereby PHF8 regulates zebrafish neuronal cell survival and jaw development in part by directly regulating the expression of the homeodomain transcription factor MSX1/MSXB, which functions downstream of multiple signalling and developmental pathways(3). Our findings indicate that an imbalance of histone methylation dynamics has a critical role in XLMR.","[Qi, Hank H.; Lan, Fei; Huarte, Maite; Yaghi, Nasser K.; Lim, Huijun; Shi, Yang] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Pathol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Qi, Hank H.; Lim, Huijun; Shi, Yang] Childrens Hosp, Dept Med, Div Newborn Med, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Sarkissian, Madathia; Roberts, Thomas M.] Dana Farber Canc Inst, Dept Canc Biol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Hu, Gang-Qing; Wang, Zhibin; Zhao, Keji] NHLBI, Lab Mol Immunol, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Bhattacharjee, Arindam; Gordon, D.

Here we report that the PHD and Jumonji C (JmjC) domain-containing protein, PHF8, while using multiple substrates, including H3K9me1/2 and H3K27me2, also functions as an H4K20me1 demethylase. PHF8 is recruited to promoters by its PHD domain based on interaction with H3K4me2/3 and controls G1-S transition in conjunction with E2F1, HCF-1 (also known as HCFC1) and SET1A (also known as SETD1A), at least in part, by removing the repressive H4K20me1 mark from a subset of E2F1-regulated gene promoters. Phosphorylation-dependent PHF8 dismissal from chromatin in prophase is apparently required for the accumulation of H4K20me1 during early mitosis, which might represent a component of the condensin II loading process. Accordingly, the HEAT repeat clusters in two non-structuralmaintenance of chromosomes (SMC) condensin II subunits, N-CAPD3 and N-CAPG2 (also known as NCAPD3 and NCAPG2, respectively), are capable of recognizing H4K20me1, and ChIP-Seq analysis demonstrates a significant overlap of condensin II and H4K20me1 sites in mitotic HeLa cells. Thus, the identification and characterization of an H4K20me1 demethylase, PHF8, has revealed an intimate link between this enzyme and two distinct events in cell cycle progression.","[Liu, Wen; Tanasa, Bogdan; Tyurina, Oksana V.; Zhou, Tian Yuan; Ohgi, Kenneth A.; Garcia-Bassets, Ivan; Rosenfeld, Michael G.] Univ Calif San Diego, Sch Med, Howard Hughes Med Inst, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Liu, Wen] Univ Calif San Diego, Grad Program Biol, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Tanasa, Bogdan] Scripps Res Inst, Kellogg Sch Sci & Technol, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; [Gassmann, Reto; Desai, Arshad] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Cellular & Mol Med, Ludwig Inst Canc Res, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Liu, Wei Ting; Dorrestein, Pieter C.] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Chem & Biochem, Skaggs Sch Pharm & Pharmaceut Sci, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Aggarwal, Aneel K.] Mt Sinai Sch Med, Dept Struct & Chem Biol, New York, NY 10029 USA","Rosenfeld, MG (reprint author), Univ Calif San Diego, Sch Med, Howard Hughes Med Inst, 9500 Gilman Dr, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.",mrosenfeld@ucsd.edu,"Garcia-Bassets, Ivan/F-5075-2010; Dorrestein, Pieter/D-5012-2012; Gassmann, Reto/M-6488-2013","Gassmann, Reto/0000-0002-0360-2977; Garcia-Bassets, Ivan/0000-0002-6941-9585","Howard Hughes Medical Institute; NCI NIH HHS [R01 CA097134-09, R01 CA097134]; NHLBI NIH HHS [R01 HL065445]; NIDDK NIH HHS [R01 DK018477, R01 DK018477-35, R01 DK039949, R01 DK039949-18, R37 DK039949]; NINDS NIH HHS [R01 NS034934, R01 NS034934-21]",,,42,195,203,2,31,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,22-Jul,2010,466,7305,,,,,508,U14,,10.1038/nature09272,,8,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,628SJ,WOS:000280141200040,20622854,No,,,11/20/17
