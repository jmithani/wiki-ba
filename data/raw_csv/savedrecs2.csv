Here we present a method to establish a strategy for such syntheses, which uses network analysis. This approach has led to the identification of a versatile synthetic intermediate that facilitated syntheses of the diterpenoid alkaloids weisaconitine D and liljestrandinine, and the core of gomandonine. We also developed a web-based graphing program that allows network analysis to be easily performed on molecules with complex frameworks. The diterpenoid alkaloids comprise some of the most architecturally complex and functional-group-dense secondary metabolites isolated. Consequently, they present a substantial challenge for chemical synthesis. The synthesis approach described here is a notable departure from other single-target-focused strategies adopted for the syntheses of related structures. Specifically, it affords not only the targeted natural products, but also intermediates and derivatives in the three families of diterpenoid alkaloids (C-18, C-19 and C-20), and so provides a unified synthetic strategy for these natural products. This work validates the utility of network analysis as a starting point for identifying strategies for the syntheses of architecturally complex secondary metabolites.","[Marth, C. J.; Gallego, G.

The new samples include, to our knowledge, the first genome-wide ancient DNA from Anatolian Neolithic farmers, whose genetic material we obtained by extracting from petrous bones, and who we show were members of the population that was the source of Europe's first farmers. We also report a transect of the steppe region in Samara between 5600 and 300 BC, which allows us to identify admixture into the steppe from at least two external sources.

No known nitrifier carries out both steps, although complete nitrification should be energetically advantageous. This functional separation has puzzled microbiologists for a century. Here we report on the discovery and cultivation of a completely nitrifying bacterium from the genus Nitrospira, a globally distributed group of nitrite oxidizers. The genome of this chemolithoautotrophic organism encodes the pathways both for ammonia and nitrite oxidation, which are concomitantly expressed during growth by ammonia oxidation to nitrate. Genes affiliated with the phylogenetically distinct ammonia monooxygenase and hydroxylamine dehydrogenase genes of Nitrospira are present in many environments and were retrieved on Nitrospira-contigs in new metagenomes from engineered systems. These findings fundamentally change our picture of nitrification and point to completely nitrifying Nitrospira as key components of nitrogen-cycling microbial communities.","[Daims, Holger; Pjevac, Petra; Han, Ping; Herbold, Craig; Palatinszky, Marton; Vierheilig, Julia; Wagner, Michael] Univ Vienna, Div Microbial Ecol, Dept Microbiol & Ecosyst Sci, A-1090 Vienna, Austria; [Lebedeva, Elena V.; Bulaev, Alexandr] Russian Acad Sci, Biotechnol Res Ctr, Winogradsky Inst Microbiol, Moscow 119071, Russia; [Albertsen, Mads; Kirkegaard, Rasmus H.; Nielsen, Per H.] Aalborg Univ, Dept Chem & Biosci, Ctr Microbial Communities, DK-9220 Aalborg, Denmark; [Jehmlich, Nico; von Bergen, Martin] UFZ Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Dept Prote, D-04318 Leipzig, Germany; [von Bergen, Martin] UFZ Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Dept Metabol, D-04318 Leipzig, Germany; [Rattei, Thomas] Univ Vienna, Div Computat Syst Biol, Dept Microbiol & Ecosyst Sci, A-1090 Vienna, Austria; [Bendinger, Bernd] Hamburg Univ Technol, DVGW Forsch Stelle TUHH, D-21073 Hamburg, Germany","Wagner, M (reprint author), Univ Vienna, Div Microbial Ecol, Dept Microbiol & Ecosyst Sci, Althanstr 14, A-1090 Vienna, Austria.",wagner@microbial-ecology.net,"; Wagner, Michael/A-7801-2011; iDiv, Deutsches Zentrum/B-5164-2016; Rattei, Thomas/F-1366-2011; von Bergen, Martin/D-7960-2011; Daims, Holger/I-8410-2012; Palatinszky, Marton/D-9876-2011; Jehmlich, Nico/B-5403-2009; Han, Ping/F-2360-2017; Bulaev, Aleksandr/O-2455-2013","Albertsen, Mads/0000-0002-6151-190X; Nielsen, Per Halkjaer/0000-0002-6402-1877; Bulaev, Aleksandr/0000-0001-7914-9817; Wagner, Michael/0000-0002-9778-7684; Rattei, Thomas/0000-0002-0592-7791; von Bergen, Martin/0000-0003-2732-2977; Daims, Holger/0000-0002-4195-0913; Palatinszky, Marton/0000-0002-3627-085X; Herbold, Craig/0000-0003-3479-0197; Pjevac, Petra/0000-0001-7344-302X","European Regional Development Funds (EFRE-Europe funds Saxony); Helmholtz Association; Austrian Science Fund (FWF) [P27319-B21, P25231-B21]; European Research Council Advanced Grant [NITRICARE 294343]; Danish Council for Independent Research [DFF-4005-00369]; Innovation Fund Denmark (EcoDesign)","We thank T.

The mutated CFTR anion channel is not fully glycosylated and shows minimal activity in bronchial epithelial cells of patients with cystic fibrosis. Low temperature or inhibition of histone deacetylases can partly rescue Delta F508 CFTR cellular processing defects and function. A favourable change of Delta F508 CFTR protein-protein interactions was proposed as a mechanism of rescue; however, CFTR interactome dynamics during temperature shift and inhibition of histone deacetylases are unknown. Here we report the first comprehensive analysis of the CFTR and Delta F508 CFTR interactome and its dynamics during temperature shift and inhibition of histone deacetylases. By using a novel deep proteomic analysis method, we identify 638 individual high-confidence CFTR interactors and discover a Delta F508 deletion-specific interactome, which is extensively remodelled upon rescue. Detailed analysis of the interactome remodelling identifies key novel interactors, whose loss promote Delta F508 CFTR channel function in primary cystic fibrosis epithelia or which are critical for CFTR biogenesis. Our results demonstrate that global remodelling of Delta F508 CFTR interactions is crucial for rescue, and provide comprehensive insight into the molecular disease mechanisms of cystic fibrosis caused by deletion of F508.","[Pankow, Sandra; Bamberger, Casimir; Calzolari, Diego; Martinez-Bartolome, Salvador; Lavallee-Adam, Mathieu; Yates, John R., III] Scripps Res Inst, Dept Chem Physiol, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; [Balch, William E.] Scripps Res Inst, Dept Cell Biol, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA","Yates, JR (reprint author), Scripps Res Inst, Dept Chem Physiol, 10550 North Torrey Pines Rd, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA.",pankows@scripps.edu; jyates@scripps.edu,,"Pankow, Sandra/0000-0003-3213-9886; Bamberger, Tom Casimir/0000-0002-3830-4486","National Institutes of Health [5R01HL079442-08, P01AG031097, P41 GM103533, HHSN268201000035C, R01HL095524, R01DK051870]; Cystic Fibrosis Foundation mass spectrometry fellowship [BALCH050X6]; Fonds de recherche du Quebec - Nature et technologies; Tobacco-Related Disease Research Program [23TRU0012]","We thank A.

Their differentiation is controlled by ROR gamma t, a ligand-regulated nuclear receptor. Here we identify the RNA helicase DEAD-box protein 5 (DDX5) as a ROR gamma t partner that coordinates transcription of selective T(H)17 genes, and is required for T(H)17-mediated inflammatory pathologies. Surprisingly, the ability of DDX5 to interact with ROR gamma t and coactivate its targets depends on intrinsic RNA helicase activity and binding of a conserved nuclear long noncoding RNA (lncRNA), Rmrp, which is mutated in patients with cartilage-hair hypoplasia. A targeted Rmrp gene mutation in mice, corresponding to a gene mutation in cartilage-hair hypoplasia patients, altered lncRNA chromatin occupancy, and reduced the DDX5-ROR gamma t interaction and ROR gamma t target gene transcription. Elucidation of the link between Rmrp and the DDX5-ROR gamma t complex reveals a role for RNA helicases and lncRNAs in tissue-specific transcriptional regulation, and provides new opportunities for therapeutic intervention in T(H)17-dependent diseases.","[Huang, Wendy; Gavzy, Samuel J.; Wu, Lin; Kim, Sangwon V.; Hall, Jason A.; Miraldi, Emily R.; Ng, Charles P.; Montoya, Nina R.; Herrera, Natalia G.; Littman, Dan R.] NYU, Sch Med, Kimmel Ctr Biol & Med, Skirball Inst, New York, NY 10016 USA; [Thomas, Benjamin; Acuto, Oreste] Univ Oxford, Sir William Dunn Sch Pathol, Oxford OX1 3RE, England; [Flynn, Ryan A.; Chang, Howard Y.] Stanford Univ, Ctr Personal Dynam Regulomes, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Miraldi, Emily R.; Bonneau, Richard] NYU, Dept Biol, Ctr Genom & Syst Biol, New York, NY 10003 USA; [Miraldi, Emily R.; Bonneau, Richard] NYU, Courant Inst Math Sci, Dept Comp Sci, New York, NY 10012 USA; [Miraldi, Emily R.; Bonneau, Richard] Simons Fdn, Simons Ctr Data Anal, New York, NY 10010 USA; [Rigo, Frank W.] ISIS Pharmaceut, Carlsbad, CA 92010 USA; [Meadows, Sarah; Myers, Richard M.] HudsonAlpha Inst Biotechnol, Huntsville, AL 35806 USA; [Domingos, Ana I.] Inst Gulbenkian Ciencias, P-2780156 Oeiras, Portugal; [Rastinejad, Fraydoon] Sanford Burnham Prebys Med Discovery Inst, Integrat Metab Program, Orlando, FL 32827 USA; [Fuller-Pace, Frances V.] Univ Dundee, Div Canc Res, Dundee DD1 9SY, Scotland; [Littman, Dan R.] NYU, Sch Med, Howard Hughes Med Inst, New York, NY 10016 USA","Littman, DR (reprint author), NYU, Sch Med, Kimmel Ctr Biol & Med, Skirball Inst, New York, NY 10016 USA.",dan.littman@med.nyu.edu,,"Flynn, Ryan/0000-0001-5013-0442; Kim, Sangwon V./0000-0001-8453-7080","Cancer Research Institute Irvington Postdoctoral Fellowship; Institutional NRSA [T32 CA009161_Levy]; National Multiple Sclerosis Society postdoctoral fellowship [FG 2089-A-1]; Crohn's and Colitis Foundation of America [329388]; Dale and Betty Frey Fellowship of the Damon Runyon Cancer Research Foundation [2105-12]; HHMI Exceptional Research Opportunities Program; NIH [F30 1F30CA189514-01, P50-HG007735, R01HG004361, R01AI080885, R01DK103358]; Howard Hughes Medical Institute","We thank M.

The inferred all-sky burst rate(8) is comparable to the core-collapse supernova rate(9) out to redshift 0.5. If the observed dispersion measures are assumed to be dominated by the intergalactic medium, the sources are at cosmological distances with redshifts of 0.2 to 1 (refs 10 and 11). These parameters are consistent with a wide range of source models(12-17). One fast burst(6) revealed circular polarization of the radio emission, but no linear polarization was detected, and hence no Faraday rotation measure could be determined. Here we report the examination of archival data revealing Faraday rotation in the fast radio burst FRB 110523. Its radio flux and dispersion measure are consistent with values from previously reported bursts and, accounting for a Galactic contribution to the dispersion and using a model of intergalactic electron density(10), we place the source at a maximum redshift of 0.5. The burst has a much higher rotation measure than expected for this line of sight through the Milky Way and the intergalactic medium, indicating magnetization in the vicinity of the source itself or within a host galaxy. The pulse was scattered by two distinct plasma screens during propagation, which requires either a dense nebula associated with the source or a location within the central region of its host galaxy. The detection in this instance of magnetization and scattering that are both local to the source favours models involving young stellar populations such as magnetars over models involving the mergers of older neutron stars, which are more likely to be located in low-density regions of the host galaxy.","[Masui, Kiyoshi] Univ British Columbia, Dept Phys & Astron, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z1, Canada; [Masui, Kiyoshi; Pen, Ue-Li] Canadian Inst Adv Res, CIFAR Program Cosmol & Grav, Toronto, ON M5G 1Z8, Canada; [Lin, Hsiu-Hsien; Peterson, Jeffrey B.; Roman, Alexander; Voytek, Tabitha] Carnegie Mellon Univ, Dept Phys, McWilliams Ctr Cosmol, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA; [Sievers, Jonathan; Voytek, Tabitha] Univ KwaZulu Natal, Sch Chem & Phys, Astrophys & Cosmol Res Unit, ZA-4001 Durban, South Africa; [Sievers, Jonathan] Natl Inst Theoret Phys NITheP, KZN Node, ZA-4001 Durban, South Africa; [Anderson, Christopher J.; Timbie, Peter T.] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Phys, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Chang, Tzu-Ching; Kuo, Cheng-Yu; Liao, Yu-Wei] Acad Sinica, Inst Astron & Astrophys, Taipei 10617, Taiwan; [Chen, Xuelei; Li, Yi-Chao] Chinese Acad Sci, Natl Astron Observ, Beijing 100012, Peoples R China; [Chen, Xuelei] Peking Univ, Ctr High Energy Phys, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China; [Ganguly, Apratim] Univ KwaZulu Natal, Astrophys & Cosmol Res Unit, Sch Math Stat & Comp Sci, ZA-4001 Durban, South Africa; [Jarvis, Miranda] Univ Toronto, Dept Astron & Astrophys, Toronto, ON M5S 3H4, Canada; [Kuo, Cheng-Yu] Natl Sun Yat Sen Univ, Dept Phys, Kaohsiung 804, Taiwan; [McLaughlin, Maura] W Virginia Univ, Dept Phys & Astron, Morgantown, WV 26506 USA; [Pen, Ue-Li] Canadian Inst Theoret Astrophys, Toronto, ON M5S 3H8, Canada; [Pen, Ue-Li] Perimeter Inst, Waterloo, ON N2L 2Y5, Canada; [Yadav, Jaswant K.] Indian Inst Sci Educ & Res Mohali, Sas Nagar, Manauli, India","Masui, K (reprint author), Univ British Columbia, Dept Phys & Astron, 6224 Agr Rd, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z1, Canada.",kiyo@physics.ubc.ca,,"Sievers, Jonathan/0000-0001-6903-5074; Masui, Kiyoshi/0000-0002-4279-6946","CIFAR Global Scholars Program; MoST [103-2112-M-001-002-MY3]; MOST 863 programme [2012AA121701]; CAS [XDB09000000]; NSFC [11373030]; NSF [1211781, 1211777]","K.M. is supported by the CIFAR Global Scholars Program.

In many cases, this magnetic energy is stored in long-lived, arched structures called magnetic flux ropes(2-5). When a flux rope destabilizes, it can either erupt and produce a coronal mass ejection or fail and collapse back towards the Sun(6-8). The prevailing belief is that the outcome of a given event is determined by a magnetohydrodynamic force imbalance called the torus instability(9-14). This belief is challenged, however, by observations indicating that torus-unstable flux ropes sometimes fail to erupt(15). This contradiction has not yet been resolved because of a lack of coronal magnetic field measurements and the limitations of idealized numerical modelling. Here we report the results of a laboratory experiment(16) that reveal a previously unknown eruption criterion below which torus-unstable flux ropes fail to erupt. We find that such 'failed torus' events occur when the guide magnetic field (that is, the ambient field that runs toroidally along the flux rope) is strong enough to prevent the flux rope from kinking. Under these conditions, the guide field interacts with electric currents in the flux rope to produce a dynamic toroidal field tension force that halts the eruption. This magnetic tension force is missing from existing eruption models, which is why such models cannot explain or predict failed torus events.","[Myers, Clayton E.; Ji, Hantao; Jara-Almonte, Jonathan] Princeton Univ, Dept Astrophys Sci, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Myers, Clayton E.; Yamada, Masaaki; Ji, Hantao; Yoo, Jongsoo; Fox, William; Jara-Almonte, Jonathan] Princeton Plasma Phys Lab, Princeton, NJ 08543 USA; [Ji, Hantao] Harbin Inst Technol, Lab Space Environm & Phys Sci, Harbin 150001, Heilongjiang, Peoples R China; [Savcheva, Antonia; DeLuca, Edward E.] Harvard Smithsonian Ctr Astrophys, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA","Myers, CE (reprint author), Princeton Univ, Dept Astrophys Sci, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA.",cmyers@pppl.gov,"DeLuca, Edward/L-7534-2013","DeLuca, Edward/0000-0001-7416-2895; Yoo, Jongsoo /0000-0003-3881-1995; Myers, Clayton/0000-0003-4539-8406",Department of Energy (DoE) [DE-AC02-09CH11466]; National Science Foundation/DoE Center for Magnetic Self-Organization (CMSO),We thank R.

Though quantum mechanics has proved adept at describing the microscopic world, quantum superposition runs counter to intuitive conceptions of reality and locality when extended to the macroscopic scale(1), as exemplified by the thought experiment of Schrodinger's cat(2). Matter-wave interferometers(3), which split and recombine wave packets in order to observe interference, provide a way to probe the superposition principle on macroscopic scales(4) and explore the transition to classical physics(5). In such experiments, large wave-packet separation is impeded by the need for long interaction times and large momentum beam splitters, which cause susceptibility to dephasing and decoherence(1). Here we use light-pulse atom interferometry(6,7) to realize quantum interference with wave packets separated by up to 54 centimetres on a timescale of 1 second. These results push quantum superposition into a new macroscopic regime, demonstrating that quantum superposition remains possible at the distances and timescales of everyday life. The sub-nanokelvin temperatures of the atoms and a compensation of transverse optical forces enable a large separation while maintaining an interference contrast of 28 per cent. In addition to testing the superposition principle in a new regime, large quantum superposition states are vital to exploring gravity with atom interferometers in greater detail. We anticipate that these states could be used to increase sensitivity in tests of the equivalence principle(8-12), measure the gravitational Aharonov-Bohm effect(13), and eventually detect gravitational waves(14) and phase shifts associated with general relativity(12).","[Kovachy, T.; Asenbaum, P.; Overstreet, C.; Donnelly, C.

These limitations can be overcome(1-3) by using optical communications based on chip-scale electronic-photonic systems(4-7) enabled by silicon-based nanophotonic devices(8). However, combining electronics and photonics on the same chip has proved challenging, owing to microchip manufacturing conflicts between electronics and photonics. Consequently, current electronic-photonic chips(9-11) are limited to niche manufacturing processes and include only a few optical devices alongside simple circuits. Here we report an electronic-photonic system on a single chip integrating over 70 million transistors and 850 photonic components that work together to provide logic, memory, and interconnect functions. This system is a realization of a microprocessor that uses on-chip photonic devices to directly communicate with other chips using light. To integrate electronics and photonics at the scale of a microprocessor chip, we adopt a 'zero-change' approach to the integration of photonics. Instead of developing a custom process to enable the fabrication of photonics(12), which would complicate or eliminate the possibility of integration with state-of-the-art transistors at large scale and at high yield, we design optical devices using a standard microelectronics foundry process that is used for modern microprocessors(13-16). This demonstration could represent the beginning of an era of chip-scale electronic-photonic systems with the potential to transform computing system architectures, enabling more powerful computers, from network infrastructure to data centres and supercomputers.","[Sun, Chen; Lee, Yunsup; Waterman, Andrew S.; Avizienis, Rimas R.; Lin, Sen; Cook, Henry M.; Ou, Albert J.; Asanovic, Krste; Stojanovic, Vladimir M.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Sun, Chen; Orcutt, Jason S.; Alloatti, Luca; Georgas, Michael S.; Moss, Benjamin R.; Atabaki, Amir H.; Leu, Jonathan C.; Chen, Yu-Hsin; Ram, Rajeev J.] MIT, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Wade, Mark T.; Shainline, Jeffrey M.; Kumar, Rajesh; Pavanello, Fabio; Popovic, Milos A.] Univ Colorado, Boulder, CO 80309 USA","Stojanovic, VM (reprint author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",krste@berkeley.edu; rajeev@mit.edu; milos.popovic@colorado.edu; vlada@berkeley.edu,,,DARPA POEM [HR0011-11-C-0100]; DARPA PERFECT [HR0011-12-2-0016]; Berkeley Wireless Research Center; UC Berkeley ASPIRE Lab; MIT CICS; National Science Foundation; FCRP IFC; Trusted Foundry; Intel; Santec; NSERC,"We thank S.

However, conventional synthesis and processing methods (alloying and thermomechanical processing) have reached certain limits in further improving the properties of magnesium and other metals(6). Ceramic particles have been introduced into metal matrices to improve the strength of the metals(7), but unfortunately, ceramic microparticles severely degrade the plasticity and machinability of metals(7), and nanoparticles, although they have the potential to improve strength while maintaining or even improving the plasticity of metals(8,9), are difficult to disperse uniformly in metal matrices(10-14). Here we show that a dense uniform dispersion of silicon carbide nanoparticles (14 per cent by volume) in magnesium can be achieved through a nanoparticle self-stabilization mechanism in molten metal.

This ascent is driven by buoyancy forces, which are enhanced by bubble nucleation and growth (vesiculation) that reduce the density of magma(1). The development of vesicularity also greatly reduces the 'strength' of magma(2), a material parameter controlling fragmentation and thus the explosive potential of the liquid rock(3). The development of vesicularity in magmas has until now been viewed (both thermodynamically and kinetically) in terms of the pressure dependence of the solubility of water in the magma, and its role in driving gas saturation, exsolution and expansion during decompression. In contrast, the possible effects of the well documented negative temperature dependence of solubility of water in magma has largely been ignored. Recently, petrological constraints have demonstrated that considerable heating of magma may indeed be a common result of the latent heat of crystallization(4) as well as viscous(5,6) and frictional(7) heating in areas of strain localization. Here we present field and experimental observations of magma vesiculation and fragmentation resulting from heating (rather than decompression). Textural analysis of volcanic ash from Santiaguito volcano in Guatemala reveals the presence of chemically heterogeneous filaments hosting micrometre-scale vesicles. The textures mirror those developed by disequilibrium melting induced via rapid heating during fault friction experiments, demonstrating that friction can generate sufficient heat to induce melting and vesiculation of hydrated silicic magma. Consideration of the experimentally determined temperature and pressure dependence of water solubility in magma reveals that, for many ascent paths, exsolution may be more efficiently achieved by heating than by decompression. We conclude that the thermal path experienced by magma during ascent strongly controls degassing, vesiculation, magma strength and the effusive-explosive transition in volcanic eruptions.","[Lavallee, Yan; Hornby, Adrian J.; Kendrick, Jackie E.; von Aulock, Felix W.; Rhodes, Emma] Univ Liverpool, Dept Earth Ocean & Ecol Sci, Liverpool L69 3GP, Merseyside, England; [Dingwell, Donald B.; Cimarelli, Corrado; Wadsworth, Fabian B.] Tech Univ Munich, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, D-80333 Munich, Germany; [Johnson, Jeffrey B.] Boise State Univ, Dept Geosci, Boise, ID 83725 USA; [Kennedy, Ben M.; Rhodes, Emma] Univ Canterbury, Geol Sci, Christchurch 8140, New Zealand; [Andrews, Benjamin J.] Smithsonian Inst, Dept Mineral Sci, Washington, DC 20560 USA; [Chigna, Gustavo] Inst Nacl Sismol Vulcanol Meteorol & Hydrol INSIV, Guatemala City, Guatemala","Lavallee, Y (reprint author), Univ Liverpool, Dept Earth Ocean & Ecol Sci, Liverpool L69 3GP, Merseyside, England.",yan.lavallee@liverpool.ac.uk,,"Hornby, Adrian/0000-0002-4969-6163; Cimarelli, Corrado/0000-0002-5707-5930; Kendrick, Jackie/0000-0001-5106-3587","European Research Council [306488, 247076]; National Science Foundation EAR [1151662]; European Union [282759]; AXA","We thank A.

Although pesticides are typically not encountered at lethal levels in the field, there is growing evidence indicating that exposure to field-realistic levels can have sublethal effects on bees, affecting their foraging behaviour(1,6,7), homing ability(8,9) and reproductive success(2,5). Bees are essential for the pollination of a wide variety of crops and the majority of wild flowering plants(10-12), but until now research on pesticide effects has been limited to direct effects on bees themselves and not on the pollination services they provide. Here we show the first evidence to our knowledge that pesticide exposure can reduce the pollination services bumblebees deliver to apples, a crop of global economic importance. Bumblebee colonies exposed to a neonicotinoid pesticide provided lower visitation rates to apple trees and collected pollen less often. Most importantly, these pesticide-exposed colonies produced apples containing fewer seeds, demonstrating a reduced delivery of pollination services. Our results also indicate that reduced pollination service delivery is not due to pesticide-induced changes in individual bee behaviour, but most likely due to effects at the colony level. These findings show that pesticide exposure can impair the ability of bees to provide pollination services, with important implications for both the sustained delivery of stable crop yields and the functioning of natural ecosystems.","[Stanley, Dara A.; Raine, Nigel E.] Royal Holloway Univ London, Sch Biol Sci, Egham TW20 0EX, Surrey, England; [Garratt, Michael P.

Prevailing hypotheses, based on evidence both from living and from fossil plants, emphasize that the earliest angiosperms were plants of small stature(7-12) with rapid life cycles(7,8,12,13) that exploited disturbed habitats(3,9,11,13,14) in open(3,9,11,13,14), or perhaps understorey, conditions(15,16). However, direct palaeontogical data relevant to understanding the seed biology and germination ecology of Early Cretaceous angiosperms are sparse. Here we report the discovery of embryos and their associated nutrient storage tissues in exceptionally well-preserved angiosperm seeds from the Early Cretaceous. Synchrotron radiation X-ray tomographic microscopy of the fossil embryos from many taxa reveals that all were tiny at the time of dispersal. These results support hypotheses based on extant plants that tiny embryos and seed dormancy are basic for angiosperms as a whole(17,18). The minute size of the fossil embryos, and the modest nutrient storage tissues dictated by the overall small seed size, is also consistent with the interpretation that many early angiosperms were opportunistic, early successional colonizers of disturbance-prone habitats(2,15,16).","[Friis, Else Marie] Swedish Museum Nat Hist, Dept Palaeobiol, SE-10405 Stockholm, Sweden; [Friis, Else Marie; Crane, Peter R.; Pedersen, Kaj Raunsgaard] Yale Univ, Sch Forestry & Environm Studies, New Haven, CT 06511 USA; [Pedersen, Kaj Raunsgaard] Univ Aarhus, Dept Earth Sci, DK-8000 Aarhus, Denmark; [Stampanoni, Marco; Marone, Federica] Paul Scherrer Inst, Swiss Light Source, CH-5232 Villigen, Switzerland; [Stampanoni, Marco] Swiss Fed Inst Technol Zurich, Inst Biomed Engn, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland","Friis, EM (reprint author), Swedish Museum Nat Hist, Dept Palaeobiol, SE-10405 Stockholm, Sweden.",else.marie.friis@nrm.se,"Marone, Federica/J-4420-2013; Stampanoni, Marco/J-4099-2013","Stampanoni, Marco/0000-0001-7486-6681",Swedish Research Council; Edward P.

Already described by Winogradsky in 18901, this division of labour between the two functional groups is a generally accepted characteristic of the biogeochemical nitrogen cycle(2). Complete oxidation of ammonia to nitrate in one organism (complete ammonia oxidation; comammox) is energetically feasible, and it was postulated that this process could occur under conditions selecting for species with lower growth rates but higher growth yields than canonical ammonia-oxidizing microorganisms(3). Still, organisms catalysing this process have not yet been discovered. Here we report the enrichment and initial characterization of two Nitrospira species that encode all the enzymes necessary for ammonia oxidation via nitrite to nitrate in their genomes, and indeed completely oxidize ammonium to nitrate to conserve energy. Their ammonia monooxygenase (AMO) enzymes are phylogenetically distinct from currently identified AMOs, rendering recent acquisition by horizontal gene transfer from known ammonia-oxidizing microorganisms unlikely. We also found highly similar amoA sequences (encoding the AMO subunit A) in public sequence databases, which were apparently misclassified as methane monooxygenases. This recognition of a novel amoA sequence group will lead to an improved understanding of the environmental abundance and distribution of ammonia-oxidizing microorganisms. Furthermore, the discovery of the long-sought-after comammox process will change our perception of the nitrogen cycle.","[van Kessel, Maartje A. H. J.; Speth, Daan R.; Op den Camp, Huub J.

The intestinal stem cell (ISC) niche provides Wnt, Notch and epidermal growth factor (EGF) signals supporting Lgr5(+) crypt base columnar ISCs for normal epithelial maintenance(1,2). However, little is known about the regulation of the ISC compartment after tissue damage. Using ex vivo organoid cultures, here we show that innate lymphoid cells (ILCs), potent producers of interleukin-22 (IL-22) after intestinal injury(3,4), increase the growth of mouse small intestine organoids in an IL-22-dependent fashion. Recombinant IL-22 directly targeted ISCs, augmenting the growth of both mouse and human intestinal organoids, increasing proliferation and promoting ISC expansion. IL-22 induced STAT3 phosphorylation in Lgr5(+) ISCs, and STAT3 was crucial for both organoid formation and IL-22-mediated regeneration. Treatment with IL-22 in vivo after mouse allogeneic bone marrow transplantation enhanced the recovery of ISCs, increased epithelial regeneration and reduced intestinal pathology and mortality from graft-versus-host disease. ATOH1-deficient organoid culture demonstrated that IL-22 induced epithelial regeneration independently of the Paneth cell niche. Our findings reveal a fundamental mechanism by which the immune system is able to support the intestinal epithelium, activating ISCs to promote regeneration.","[Lindemans, Caroline A.; Calafiore, Marco; Mertelsmann, Anna M.; O'Connor, Margaret H.; Jenq, Robert R.; Lawrence, Gillian; Ivanov, Juliet A.; Fu, Ya-Yuan; Takashima, Shuichiro; van den Brink, Marcel R.

How IFN gamma elicits this effect is unknown, but many studies suggest a role for macroautophagy (herein termed autophagy), a process by which cytoplasmic contents are targeted for lysosomal degradation(1). The involvement of autophagy has been defined based on studies in cultured cells where M. tuberculosis co-localizes with autophagy factors ATG5, ATG12, ATG16L1, p62, NDP52, BECN1 and LC3 (refs 2-6), stimulation of autophagy increases bacterial killing(6-8), and inhibition of autophagy increases bacterial survival(1,2,4,6,7). Notably, these studies reveal modest (similar to 1.5-3-fold change) effects on M. tuberculosis replication. By contrast, mice lacking ATG5 in monocyte-derived cells and neutrophils (polymorponuclear cells, PMNs) succumb to M. tuberculosis within 30 days(4,9), an extremely severe phenotype similar to mice lacking IFN gamma signalling(10,11). Importantly, ATG5 is the only autophagy factor that has been studied during M. tuberculosis infection in vivo and autophagy-independent functions of ATG5 have been described(12-18). For this reason, we used a genetic approach to elucidate the role for multiple autophagy-related genes and the requirement for autophagy in resistance to M. tuberculosis infection in vivo. Here we show that, contrary to expectation, autophagic capacity does not correlate with the outcome of M. tuberculosis infection. Instead, ATG5 plays a unique role in protection against M. tuberculosis by preventing PMN-mediated immunopathology. Furthermore, while Atg5 is dispensable in alveolar macrophages during M. tuberculosis infection, loss of Atg5 in PMNs can sensitize mice to M. tuberculosis. These findings shift our understanding of the role of ATG5 during M. tuberculosis infection, reveal new outcomes of ATG5 activity, and shed light on early events in innate immunity that are required to regulate disease pathology and bacterial replication.","[Kimmey, Jacqueline M.; Huynh, Jeremy P.; Weiss, Leslie A.; Stallings, Christina L.] Washington Univ, Sch Med, Dept Mol Microbiol, St Louis, MO 63110 USA; [Park, Sunmin; Kambal, Amal; Virgin, Herbert W.] Washington Univ, Sch Med, Dept Pathol & Immunol, St Louis, MO 63110 USA; [Debnath, Jayanta] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Pathol, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; [Debnath, Jayanta] Univ Calif San Francisco, Helen Diller Family Comprehens Canc Ctr, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA","Stallings, CL (reprint author), Washington Univ, Sch Med, Dept Mol Microbiol, St Louis, MO 63110 USA.",stallings@wusm.wustl.edu,,"Kimmey, Jacqueline M/0000-0003-1330-8525; Debnath, Jayanta/0000-0002-8745-4069",Beckman Young Investigator Award from the Arnold and Mabel Beckman Foundation; National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship [DGE-1143954]; NIGMS Cell and Molecular Biology Training Grant [GM007067];  [U19 AI109725],"C.L.S. is supported by a Beckman Young Investigator Award from the Arnold and Mabel Beckman Foundation.

It results in an amino-acid change at codon 388 from glycine to arginine (p.Gly388Arg) in the transmembrane domain of the receptor. Despite compelling genetic evidence for the association of this common variant with cancers of the bone(1), breast(2), colon(3), prostate(4,5), skin(6), lung(7,8), head and neck(9), as well as soft-tissue sarcomas and non-Hodgkin lymphoma, the underlying biological mechanism has remained elusive. Here we show that substitution of the conserved glycine 388 residue to a charged arginine residue alters the transmembrane spanning segment and exposes a membrane-proximal cytoplasmic signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) binding site Y-390-(P) XXQ(393). We demonstrate that such membrane-proximal STAT3 binding motifs in the germline of type I membrane receptors enhance STAT3 tyrosine phosphorylation by recruiting STAT3 proteins to the inner cell membrane. Remarkably, such germline variants frequently co-localize with somatic mutations in the Catalogue of Somatic Mutations in Cancer (COSMIC) database. Using Fgfr4 single nucleotide polymorphism knock-in mice and transgenic mouse models for breast and lung cancers, we validate the enhanced STAT3 signalling induced by the FGFR4 Arg388-variant in vivo. Thus, our findings elucidate the molecular mechanism behind the genetic association of rs351855 with accelerated cancer progression and suggest that germline variants of cell-surface molecules that recruit STAT3 to the inner cell membrane are a significant risk for cancer prognosis and disease progression.","[Ulaganathan, Vijay K.; Sperl, Bianca; Ullrich, Axel] Max Planck Inst Biochem, Dept Mol Biol, D-82152 Martinsried, Germany; [Rapp, Ulf R.] Max Planck Inst Heart & Lung Res, Mol Mech Lung Canc, D-61231 Bad Nauheim, Germany","Ullrich, A (reprint author), Max Planck Inst Biochem, Dept Mol Biol, Klopferspitz 18, D-82152 Martinsried, Germany.",ulaganat@biochem.mpg.de; ullrich@biochem.mpg.de,,"Ulaganathan, Vijay Kumar/0000-0002-4717-6228","NHLBI [HL-102923, HL-102924, HL-102925, HL-102926, HL-103010]","We thank the NHLBI GO Exome Sequencing Project and its ongoing studies, which produced and provided exome variant calls for comparison: the Lung GO Sequencing Project (HL-102923), the WHI Sequencing Project (HL-102924), the Broad GO Sequencing Project (HL-102925), the Seattle GO Sequencing Project (HL-102926) and the Heart GO Sequencing Project (HL-103010).

Chromatin has the potential to restrict accessibility of binding sites; however, in which context chromatin states are instructive for TF binding remains mainly unknown(1,2). To explore the contribution of DNA methylation to constrained TF binding, we mapped DNase-I-hypersensitive sites in murine stem cells in the presence and absence of DNA methylation. Methylation-restricted sites are enriched for TF motifs containing CpGs, especially for those of NRF1. In fact, the TF NRF1 occupies several thousand additional sites in the unmethylated genome, resulting in increased transcription. Restoring de novo methyltransferase activity initiates remethylation at these sites and outcompetes NRF1 binding. This suggests that binding of DNA-methylation-sensitive TFs relies on additional determinants to induce local hypomethylation. In support of this model, removal of neighbouring motifs in cis or of a TF in trans causes local hypermethylation and subsequent loss of NRF1 binding. This competition between DNA methylation and TFs in vivo reveals a case of cooperativity between TFs that acts indirectly via DNA methylation. Methylation removal by methylation-insensitive factors enables occupancy of methylation-sensitive factors, a principle that rationalizes hypomethylation of regulatory regions.","[Domcke, Silvia; Bardet, Anais Flore; Ginno, Paul Adrian; Hartl, Dominik; Burger, Lukas; Schuebeler, Dirk] Friedrich Miescher Inst Biomed Res, CH-4058 Basel, Switzerland; [Domcke, Silvia; Hartl, Dominik; Schuebeler, Dirk] Univ Basel, Fac Sci, CH-4003 Basel, Switzerland; [Burger, Lukas] Swiss Inst Bioinformat, CH-4058 Basel, Switzerland","Schubeler, D (reprint author), Friedrich Miescher Inst Biomed Res, Maulbeerstr 66, CH-4058 Basel, Switzerland.",dirk@fmi.ch,,"Domcke, Silvia/0000-0002-4102-7774",Novartis Research Foundation; European Union (NoE 'EpiGeneSys') [FP7-HEALTH-2010-257082]; European Union ('Blueprint' consortium) [FP7-282510]; European Research Council (EpiGePlas); Swiss initiative in Systems Biology (RTD Cell Plasticity); EMBO postdoctoral long-term fellowships; Boehringer Ingelheim Fonds,"We are grateful to S.

Repeat proteins composed of multiple tandem copies of a modular structure unit(1) are widespread in nature and have critical roles in molecular recognition, signalling, and other essential biological processes(2). Naturally occurring repeat proteins have been re-engineered for molecular recognition and modular scaffolding applications(3-5). Here we use computational protein design to investigate the space of folded structures that can be generated by tandem repeating a simple helix-loop-helix-loop structural motif. Eighty-three designs with sequences unrelated to known repeat proteins were experimentally characterized. Of these, 53 are monomeric and stable at 95 degrees C, and 43 have solution X-ray scattering spectra consistent with the design models. Crystal structures of 15 designs spanning a broad range of curvatures are in close agreement with the design models with root mean square deviations ranging from 0.7 to 2.5 angstrom. Our results show that existing repeat proteins occupy only a small fraction of the possible repeat protein sequence and structure space and that it is possible to design novel repeat proteins with precisely specified geometries, opening up a wide array of new possibilities for biomolecular engineering.","[Brunette, T.

The modular nature of repeat proteins enables the rapid construction and diversification of extended binding surfaces by duplication and recombination of simple building blocks(3,4). The overall architecture of tandem repeat protein structures-which is dictated by the internal geometry and local packing of the repeat building blocks-is highly diverse, ranging from extended, super-helical folds that bind peptide, DNA, and RNA partners(5-9), to closed and compact conformations with internal cavities suitable for small molecule binding and catalysis(10). Here we report the development and validation of computational methods for de novo design of tandem repeat protein architectures driven purely by geometric criteria defining the inter-repeat geometry, without reference to the sequences and structures of existing repeat protein families. We have applied these methods to design a series of closed alpha-solenoid(11) repeat structures (alpha-toroids) in which the inter-repeat packing geometry is constrained so as to juxtapose the amino (N) and carboxy (C) termini; several of these designed structures have been validated by X-ray crystallography. Unlike previous approaches to tandem repeat protein engineering(12-20), our design procedure does not rely on template sequence or structural information taken from natural repeat proteins and hence can produce structures unlike those seen in nature. As an example, we have successfully designed and validated closed alpha-solenoid repeats with a left-handed helical architecture that-to our knowledge-is not yet present in the protein structure database(21).","[Doyle, Lindsey; Hallinan, Jazmine; Bolduc, Jill; Stoddard, Barry L.; Bradley, Philip] Fred Hutchinson Canc Res Ctr, Div Basic Sci, Seattle, WA 98109 USA; [Parmeggiani, Fabio; Baker, David] Univ Washington, Dept Biochem, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Parmeggiani, Fabio; Baker, David; Bradley, Philip] Univ Washington, Inst Prot Design, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Baker, David] Univ Washington, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Bradley, Philip] Fred Hutchinson Canc Res Ctr, Div Publ Hlth Sci, Seattle, WA 98019 USA","Bradley, P (reprint author), Fred Hutchinson Canc Res Ctr, Div Basic Sci, 1100 Fairview Ave N, Seattle, WA 98109 USA.",pbradley@fredhutch.org,"Parmeggiani, Fabio/B-9344-2016; Baker, David/K-8941-2012","Parmeggiani, Fabio/0000-0001-8548-1090; Baker, David/0000-0001-7896-6217","National Institutes of Health [R21GM106117, R01GM49857]; Swiss National Science Foundation Postdoc Fellowship [PBZHP3-125470]; Human Frontier Science Program Long-Term Fellowship [LT000070/2009-L]","The authors thank Scientific Computing at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center for providing the computational infrastructure necessary for this project.

Songbirds learn vocalizations composed of syllables; in adult birds, each syllable is produced by a different sequence of action potential bursts in the premotor cortical area HVC. Here we carried out recordings of large populations of HVC neurons in singing juvenile birds throughout learning to examine the emergence of neural sequences. Early in vocal development, HVC neurons begin producing rhythmic bursts, temporally locked to a 'prototype' syllable. Different neurons are active at different latencies relative to syllable onset to form a continuous sequence. Through development, as new syllables emerge from the prototype syllable, initially highly overlapping burst sequences become increasingly distinct.

An important assumption underlying much of this work is that evoked behavioural changes reflect the function of the manipulated circuits. We show that this assumption is problematic because it disregards indirect effects on the independent functions of downstream circuits. Transient inactivations of motor cortex in rats and nucleus interface (Nif) in songbirds severely degraded task-specific movement patterns and courtship songs, respectively, which are learned skills that recover spontaneously after permanent lesions of the same areas. We resolve this discrepancy in songbirds, showing that Nif silencing acutely affects the function of HVC, a downstream song control nucleus. Paralleling song recovery, the off-target effects resolved within days of Nif lesions, a recovery consistent with homeostatic regulation of neural activity in HVC. These results have implications for interpreting transient circuit manipulations and for understanding recovery after brain lesions.","[Otchy, Timothy M.; Wolff, Steffen B.

We established Arabidopsis leaf-and root-derived microbiota culture collections representing the majority of bacterial species that are reproducibly detectable by culture-independent community sequencing. We found an extensive taxonomic overlap between the leaf and root microbiota. Genome drafts of 400 isolates revealed a large overlap of genome-encoded functional capabilities between leaf-and root-derived bacteria with few significant differences at the level of individual functional categories. Using defined bacterial communities and a gnotobiotic Arabidopsis plant system we show that the isolates form assemblies resembling natural microbiota on their cognate host organs, but are also capable of ectopic leaf or root colonization. While this raises the possibility of reciprocal relocation between root and leaf microbiota members, genome information and recolonization experiments also provide evidence for microbiota specialization to their respective niche.","[Bai, Yang; Srinivas, Girish; Garrido-Oter, Ruben; Rott, Matthias; Dombrowski, Nina; Spaepen, Stijn; Schulze-Lefert, Paul] Max Planck Inst Plant Breeding Res, Dept Plant Microbe Interact, D-50829 Cologne, Germany; [Mueller, Daniel B.; Potthoff, Eva; Remus-Emsermann, Mitja; Vorholt, Julia A.] ETH, Inst Microbiol, CH-8093 Zurich, Switzerland; [Garrido-Oter, Ruben] Univ Dusseldorf, Dept Algorithm Bioinformat, D-40225 Dusseldorf, Germany; [Garrido-Oter, Ruben; McHardy, Alice C.; Schulze-Lefert, Paul] Max Planck Inst Plant Breeding Res, Cluster Excellence Plant Sci CEPLAS, D-50829 Cologne, Germany; [Muench, Philipp C.; McHardy, Alice C.] Helmholtz Ctr Infect Res, Computat Biol Infect Res, D-38124 Braunschweig, Germany; [Muench, Philipp C.] Univ Munich, Max von Pettenkofer Inst, German Ctr Infect Res DZIF, Partner Site LMU Munich, D-80336 Munich, Germany; [Muench, Philipp C.] German Ctr Infect Res DZIF, Partner Site Hannover Braunschweig, D-38124 Braunschweig, Germany; [Huettel, Bruno] Max Planck Inst Plant Breeding Res, Max Planck Genome Ctr, D-50829 Cologne, Germany","Vorholt, JA (reprint author), ETH, Inst Microbiol, CH-8093 Zurich, Switzerland.",jvorholt@ethz.ch; schlef@mpipz.mpg.de,"Vorholt, Julia/K-3514-2016; Schulze-Lefert, Paul/B-6707-2011; Remus-Emsermann, Mitja/R-3776-2016; Dombrowski, Nina/L-8535-2017","Remus-Emsermann, Mitja/0000-0002-6378-9526; Dombrowski, Nina/0000-0003-1917-2577; Spaepen, Stijn/0000-0001-5465-8287",Max Planck Society; European Research Council; 'Cluster of Excellence on Plant Sciences' program - Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft; German Center for Infection Research (DZIF); ETH Zurich [ETH-41 14-2]; Swiss National Research Foundation [310030B_152835],"We thank D.

However, the role of A20 in attenuating inflammatory signalling is unclear owing to paradoxical in vitro and in vivo findings. Here we utilize genetically engineered mice bearing mutations in the A20 ovarian tumour (OTU)-type deubiquitinase domain or in the zinc finger-4 (ZnF4) ubiquitin-binding motif to investigate these discrepancies. We find that phosphorylation of A20 promotes cleavage of Lys63-linked polyubiquitin chains by the OTU domain and enhances ZnF4-mediated substrate ubiquitination. Additionally, levels of linear ubiquitination dictate whether A20-deficient cells die in response to tumour necrosis factor. Mechanistically, linear ubiquitin chains preserve the architecture of the TNFR1 signalling complex by blocking A20-mediated disassembly of Lys63-linked polyubiquitin scaffolds. Collectively, our studies reveal molecular mechanisms whereby A20 deubiquitinase activity and ubiquitin binding, linear ubiquitination, and cellular kinases cooperate to regulate inflammation and cell death.","[Wertz, Ingrid E.; Kategaya, Lorna] Genentech Inc, Discovery Oncol, San Francisco, CA 94080 USA; [Wertz, Ingrid E.; Kusam, Saritha; Lam, Cynthia; Popovych, Nataliya; Helgason, Elizabeth; Schoeffler, Allyn; Kategaya, Lorna; Zindal, Anuradha; Quan, Clifford; Tom, Jeffrey; Fairbrother, Wayne J.; Dueber, Erin] Genentech Inc, Early Discovery Biochem, San Francisco, CA 94080 USA; [Newton, Kim; Ugger, Debra D.; Dixit, Vishva M.] Genentech Inc, Physiol Chem, San Francisco, CA 94080 USA; [Seshasayee, Dhaya; Zhang, Juan; Jeet, Surinder; Ramamoorthi, Nandhini; Martin, Flavius; Townsend, Michael; DeVoss, Jason; Lee, Wyne P.; Balazs, Mercedesz] Genentech Inc, Immunol, San Francisco, CA 94080 USA; [Newman, Robert J.; Warming, Soren; Kolumam, Ganesh] Genentech Inc, Mol Biol, San Francisco, CA 94080 USA; [Horikawa, Keisuke] Australian Natl Univ, John Curtin Sch Med Res, Dept Canc Biol & Therapeut, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia; [Sandoval, Wendy; Yu, Kebing] Genentech Inc, Prot Chem, San Francisco, CA 94080 USA; [Ukund, Susmith M.] Genentech Inc, Structural Biol, San Francisco, CA 94080 USA; [Liu, Jinfeng] Genentech Inc, Bioinformat, San Francisco, CA 94080 USA; [Caplazi, Patrick] Genentech Inc, Pathol, San Francisco, CA 94080 USA; [Goodnow, Christopher C.] Garvan Inst Med Res, Div Immunol, Immunogen Lab, Darlinghurst, NSW 2010, Australia","Wertz, IE (reprint author), Genentech Inc, Discovery Oncol, San Francisco, CA 94080 USA.",ingrid@gene.com; dixit@gene.com,,"Caplazi, Patrick/0000-0002-3411-1257","Genentech Protein Expression Group; Sequencing Facility, Luminex Core Group; Animal Facility and Genotyping Laboratory; Mouse Models Group","The authors thank J.

Specifically, the magnetorotational instability and dynamo action(3-6) have been suggested as a mechanism for the growth of magnetar-strength magnetic fields (of 10(15) gauss and above) and for powering the explosion(7-10) of a rotating massive star(11,12). Such stars are candidate progenitors of type Ic-bl hypernovae(13,14), which make up all supernovae that are connected to long gamma-ray bursts(15,16). The magnetorotational instability has been studied with local high-resolution shearing-box simulations in three dimensions(17-19), and with global two-dimensional simulations(20), but it is not known whether turbulence driven by this instability can result in the creation of a large-scale, ordered and dynamically relevant field. Here we report results from global, three-dimensional, general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamic turbulence simulations. We show that hydromagnetic turbulence in rapidly rotating protoneutron stars produces an inverse cascade of energy. We find a large-scale, ordered toroidal field that is consistent with the formation of bipolar magnetorotationally driven outflows. Our results demonstrate that rapidly rotating massive stars are plausible progenitors for both type Ic-bl supernovae(13,21,22) and long gamma-ray bursts, and provide a viable mechanism for the formation of magnetars(23,24). Moreover, our findings suggest that rapidly rotating massive stars might lie behind potentially magnetar-powered superluminous supernovae(25,26).","[Moesta, Philipp; Ott, Christian D.; Radice, David; Roberts, Luke F.] CALTECH, Walter Burke Inst Theoret Phys, TAPIR, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA; [Moesta, Philipp] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Astron, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Schnetter, Erik] Perimeter Inst Theoret Phys, Waterloo, ON N2L 2Y5, Canada; [Schnetter, Erik] Univ Guelph, Dept Phys, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada; [Schnetter, Erik] Louisiana State Univ, Ctr Computat & Technol, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA; [Haas, Roland] Max Planck Inst Gravitat Phys, D-14476 Potsdam, Germany","Mosta, P (reprint author), CALTECH, Walter Burke Inst Theoret Phys, TAPIR, Mailcode 350-17, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA.",pmoesta@berkeley.edu,"Ott, Christian/G-2651-2011","Ott, Christian/0000-0003-4993-2055; Schnetter, Erik/0000-0002-4518-9017; Roberts, Luke/0000-0001-7364-7946","National Science Foundation (NSF) [AST-1212170, PHY-1151197, OCI-0905046]; NASA [PF5-160140, PF3-140114]; National Science and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC); Sherman Fairchild Foundation","We thank S.

In the field of quantum information processing (QIP) and quantum networking, various proposals discuss the possibility of hybrid architectures(1) where specific tasks are delegated to the most suitable subsystem. For example, in quantum networks, it may be advantageous to transfer information from a subsystem that has good memory properties to another subsystem that is more efficient at transporting information between nodes in the network. For trapped ions, a hybrid system formed of different species introduces extra degrees of freedom that can be exploited to expand and refine the control of the system. Ions of different elements have previously been used in QIP experiments for sympathetic cooling(2), creation of entanglement through dissipation(3), and quantum non-demolition measurement of one species with another(4). Here we demonstrate an entangling quantum gate between ions of different elements which can serve as an important building block of QIP, quantum networking, precision spectroscopy, metrology, and quantum simulation. A geometric phase gate between a Be-9(+) ion and a Mg-25(+) ion is realized through an effective spin-spin interaction generated by state-dependent forces induced with laser beams(5-9). Combined with single-qubit gates and same-species entangling gates, this mixed-element entangling gate provides a complete set of gates over such a hybrid system for universal QIP(10-12). Using a sequence of such gates, we demonstrate a CNOT (controlled-NOT) gate and a SWAP gate(13). We further demonstrate the robustness of these gates against thermal excitation and show improved detection in quantum logic spectroscopy(14). We also observe a strong violation of a CHSH (Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt)-type Bell inequality(15) on entangled states composed of different ion species.","[Tan, T. R.; Gaebler, J.

Bipartite entangled states of identical particles have been generated and studied in several experiments, and post-selected or heralded entangled states involving pairs of photons, single photons and single atoms, or different nuclei in the solid state, have also been produced(6-12). Here we use a deterministic quantum logic gate to generate a 'hybrid' entangled state of two trapped-ion qubits held in different isotopes of calcium, perform full tomography of the state produced, and make a test of Bell's inequality with non-identical atoms. We use a laser-driven two-qubit gate(13), whose mechanism is insensitive to the qubits' energy splittings, to produce a maximally entangled state of one Ca-40(+) qubit and one Ca-43(+) qubit, held 3.5 micrometres apart in the same ion trap, with 99.8 +/- 0.6 per cent fidelity. We test the CHSH (Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt)(14) version of Bell's inequality for this novel entangled state and find that it is violated by 15 standard deviations; in this test, we close the detection loophole(8) but not the locality loophole(7). Mixed-species quantum logic is a powerful technique for the construction of a quantum computer based on trapped ions, as it allows protection of memory qubits while other qubits undergo logic operations or are used as photonic interfaces to other processing units(15,16). The entangling gate mechanism used here can also be applied to qubits stored in different atomic elements; this would allow both memory and logic gate errors caused by photon scattering to be reduced below the levels required for fault-tolerant quantum error correction, which is an essential prerequisite for general-purpose quantum computing.","[Ballance, C.

Although experimental advances have enabled elucidation of near-field radiative heat transfer in gaps as small as 20-30 nanometres (refs 4-6), quantitative analysis in the extreme near field (less than 10 nanometres) has been greatly limited by experimental challenges. Moreover, the results of pioneering measurements(7,8) differed from theoretical predictions by orders of magnitude. Here we use custom-fabricated scanning probes with embedded thermocouples(9,10), in conjunction with new microdevices capable of periodic temperature modulation, to measure radiative heat transfer down to gaps as small as two nanometres. For our experiments we deposited suitably chosen metal or dielectric layers on the scanning probes and microdevices, enabling direct study of extreme near-field radiation between silica-silica, silicon nitride-silicon nitride and gold-gold surfaces to reveal marked, gap-size-dependent enhancements of radiative heat transfer. Furthermore, our state-of-the-art calculations of radiative heat transfer, performed within the theoretical framework of fluctuational electrodynamics, are in excellent agreement with our experimental results, providing unambiguous evidence that confirms the validity of this theory(11-13) for modelling radiative heat transfer in gaps as small as a few nanometres. This work lays the foundations required for the rational design of novel technologies that leverage nanoscale radiative heat transfer.","[Kim, Kyeongtae; Song, Bai; Lee, Woochul; Jeong, Wonho; Cui, Longji; Thompson, Dakotah; Meyhofer, Edgar; Reddy, Pramod] Univ Michigan, Dept Mech Engn, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Fernandez-Hurtado, Victor; Feist, Johannes; Garcia-Vidal, Francisco J.; Cuevas, Juan Carlos] Univ Autonoma Madrid, Dept Fis Teor Mat Condensada, E-28049 Madrid, Spain; [Fernandez-Hurtado, Victor; Feist, Johannes; Garcia-Vidal, Francisco J.; Cuevas, Juan Carlos] Univ Autonoma Madrid, Condensed Matter Phys Ctr IFIMAC, E-28049 Madrid, Spain; [Reid, M.

If we are to synthesize artificial structures with similar control and complexity to biological systems, we need energy-and material-efficient bottom-up processes to create building blocks of various shapes that can further assemble into hierarchical structures. Lithographic top-down processing(2) allows a high level of structural control in microparticle production but at the expense of limited productivity. Conversely, bottom-up particle syntheses(3-8) have higher material and energy efficiency, but are more limited in the shapes achievable. Linear hydrocarbons are known to pass through a series of metastable plastic rotator phases before freezing(9,10). Here we show that by using appropriate cooling protocols, we can harness these phase transitions to control the deformation of liquid hydrocarbon droplets and then freeze them into solid particles, permanently preserving their shape. Upon cooling, the droplets spontaneously break their shape symmetry several times, morphing through a series of complex regular shapes owing to the internal phase-transition processes. In this way we produce particles including micrometre-sized octahedra, various polygonal platelets, O-shapes, and fibres of submicrometre diameter, which can be selectively frozen into the corresponding solid particles. This mechanism offers insights into achieving complex morphogenesis from a system with a minimal number of molecular components.","[Denkov, Nikolai; Tcholakova, Slavka; Lesov, Ivan; Cholakova, Diana] Univ Sofia, Fac Chem & Pharm, Dept Chem & Pharmaceut Engn, Sofia 1164, Bulgaria; [Smoukov, Stoyan K.] Univ Cambridge, Dept Mat Sci & Met, Act & Intelligent Mat Lab, Cambridge CB3 0FS, England","Smoukov, SK (reprint author), Univ Cambridge, Dept Mat Sci & Met, Act & Intelligent Mat Lab, Cambridge CB3 0FS, England.",sks46@cam.ac.uk,"Lesov, Ivan/E-6358-2016","Lesov, Ivan/0000-0002-0366-7922",European Research Council (ERC) [280078]; European Commission [286205],"This work was funded by the European Research Council (ERC) grant to S.K.S., EMATTER (#280078).

The only previous estimates of change during the twentieth century are based on empirical modelling(3-5) and energy balance modelling(6,7). Consequently, no observation-based estimates of the contribution from the GIS to the global-mean sea level budget before 1990 are included in the Fifth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change(8). Here we calculate spatial ice mass loss around the entire GIS from 1900 to the present using aerial imagery from the 1980s. This allows accurate high-resolution mapping of geomorphic features related to the maximum extent of the GIS during the Little Ice Age(9) at the end of the nineteenth century. We estimate the total ice mass loss and its spatial distribution for three periods: 1900-1983 (75.1 +/- 29.4 gigatonnes per year), 1983-2003 (73.8 +/- 40.5 gigatonnes per year), and 2003-2010 (186.4 +/- 18.9 gigatonnes per year). Furthermore, using two surface mass balance models(10,11) we partition the mass balance into a term for surface mass balance (that is, total precipitation minus total sublimation minus runoff) and a dynamic term. We find that many areas currently undergoing change are identical to those that experienced considerable thinning throughout the twentieth century. We also reveal that the surface mass balance term shows a considerable decrease since 2003, whereas the dynamic term is constant over the past 110 years. Overall, our observation-based findings show that during the twentieth century the GIS contributed at least 25.0 +/- 9.4 millimetres of global-mean sea level rise. Our result will help to close the twentieth-century sea level budget, which remains crucial for evaluating the reliability of models used to predict global sea level rise(1,8).","[Kjeldsen, Kristian K.; Korsgaard, Niels J.; Bjork, Anders A.; Funder, Svend; Larsen, Nicolaj K.; Siggaard-Andersen, Marie-Louise; Schomacker, Anders; Willerslev, Eske; Kjaer, Kurt H.] Univ Copenhagen, Ctr GeoGenet, Nat Hist Museum, DK-1350 Copenhagen, Denmark; [Kjeldsen, Kristian K.] Univ Ottawa, Dept Earth Sci, Ottawa, ON K1N 6N5, Canada; [Khan, Shfaqat A.] Tech Univ Denmark, Dept Geodesy, DTU Space Natl Space Inst, DK-2800 Lyngby, Denmark; [Box, Jason E.; Colgan, William; Andresen, Camilla S.] Geol Survey Denmark & Greenland, Dept Marine Geol & Glaciol, DK-1350 Copenhagen, Denmark; [Larsen, Nicolaj K.] Aarhus Univ, Dept Geosci, DK-8000 Aarhus, Denmark; [Bamber, Jonathan L.] Univ Bristol, Bristol Glaciol Ctr, Bristol BS8 1SS, Avon, England; [Colgan, William] York Univ, Dept Earth & Space Sci & Engn, Toronto, ON M3J 1P3, Canada; [van den Broeke, Michiel] Univ Utrecht, Inst Marine & Atmospher Res, NL-80005 Utrecht, Netherlands; [Andresen, Camilla S.] Univ Oslo, Dept Geosci, N-0316 Oslo, Norway","Kjaer, KH (reprint author), Univ Copenhagen, Ctr GeoGenet, Nat Hist Museum, DK-1350 Copenhagen, Denmark.",kurtk@snm.ku.dk,"; Korsgaard, Niels/D-8256-2013; Colgan, William/H-1570-2014; Bjork, Anders/B-1625-2013; Van den Broeke, Michiel/F-7867-2011; Bamber, Jonathan/C-7608-2011; Khan, Shfaqat/B-2664-2012; Larsen, Nicolaj/A-3509-2012; Box, Jason/H-5770-2013","Kjeldsen, Kristian Kjellerup/0000-0002-8557-5131; Box, Jason/0000-0003-0052-8705; Korsgaard, Niels/0000-0002-8700-7023; Colgan, William/0000-0001-6334-1660; Bjork, Anders/0000-0002-4919-792X; Van den Broeke, Michiel/0000-0003-4662-7565; Bamber, Jonathan/0000-0002-2280-2819; Khan, Shfaqat/0000-0002-2689-8563; Larsen, Nicolaj/0000-0002-0117-1106; ","Danish Council for Independent Research (FNU) [DFF-0602-02526B, DFF-4181-00126]; Centre for GeoGenetics - Danish National Research Foundation [DNRF94]; Sapere Aude: DFF-Research Talent programme [DFF-4090-00151]; GeoCenter Denmark (""Multi-millennial ice volume changes of the Greenland ice sheet""); Carlsberg Foundation [CF14-0145]; Netherlands Polar Program of the Netherlands Organization of Scientific Research (NWO); European Research Council (EUFP7/ERC) [320816]","This study would not have been possible without the aid of The Danish Geodata Agency (GST), who gave us access to their historical aerial photographs.

However, the recent introduction of cleaner technologies in the UK has led to reductions in the emissions of nitrogen oxides, with concomitant decreases in N deposition(4). The degree to which grassland biodiversity can be expected to 'bounce back' in response to these improvements in air quality is uncertain, with a suggestion that long-term chronic N addition may lead to an alternative low biodiversity state5. Here we present evidence from the 160-year-old Park Grass Experiment at Rothamsted Research, UK6, that shows a positive response of biodiversity to reducing N addition from either atmospheric pollution or fertilizers. The proportion of legumes, species richness and diversity increased across the experiment between 1991 and 2012 as both wet and dry N deposition declined. Plots that stopped receiving inorganic N fertilizer in 1989 recovered much of the diversity that had been lost, especially if limed. There was no evidence that chronic N addition has resulted in an alternative low biodiversity state on the Park Grass plots, except where there has been extreme acidification, although it is likely that the recovery of plant communities has been facilitated by the twice-yearly mowing and removal of biomass. This may also explain why a comparable response of plant communities to reduced N inputs has yet to be observed in the wider landscape.","[Storkey, J.; Macdonald, A. J.; Poulton, P.

Under such sexual antagonism, theory predicts the evolution of genetic architectures that resolve this sexual conflict(2-5). Yet, despite intense theoretical and empirical interest, the specific loci underlying sexually antagonistic phenotypes have rarely been identified, limiting our understanding of how sexual conflict impacts genome evolution(3,6) and the maintenance of genetic diversity(6,7). Here we identify a large effect locus controlling age at maturity in Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar), an important fitness trait in which selection favours earlier maturation in males than females(8), and show it is a clear example of sex-dependent dominance that reduces intralocus sexual conflict and maintains adaptive variation in wild populations. Using high-density single nucleotide polymorphism data across 57 wild populations and whole genome re-sequencing, we find that the vestigial-like family member 3 gene (VGLL3) exhibits sex-dependent dominance in salmon, promoting earlier and later maturation in males and females, respectively. VGLL3, an adiposity regulator associated with size and age at maturity in humans, explained 39% of phenotypic variation, an unexpectedly large proportion for what is usually considered a highly polygenic trait. Such large effects are predicted under balancing selection from either sexually antagonistic or spatially varying selection(9,10). Our results provide the first empirical example of dominance reversal allowing greater optimization of phenotypes within each sex, contributing to the resolution of sexual conflict in a major and widespread evolutionary trade-off between age and size at maturity. They also provide key empirical evidence for how variation in reproductive strategies can be maintained over large geographical scales. We anticipate these findings will have a substantial impact on population management in a range of harvested species where trends towards earlier maturation have been observed.","[Barson, Nicola J.; Kent, Matthew; Nome, Torfinn; Lien, Sigbjorn] Norwegian Univ Life Sci, Dept Anim & Aquacultural Sci, Ctr Integrat Genet CIGENE, NO-1432 As, Norway; [Aykanat, Tutku; Primmer, Craig R.] Univ Turku, Dept Biol, FI-20014 Turku, Finland; [Hindar, Kjetil; Bolstad, Geir H.; Fiske, Peder; Jensen, Arne J.; Karlsson, Sten; Naesje, Tor F.] Norwegian Inst Nat Res NINA, NO-7485 Trondheim, Norway; [Baranski, Matthew; Jacq, Celeste] Nofima Norwegian Inst Food Fisheries & Aquacultur, NO-1431 As, Norway; [Johnston, Susan E.] Univ Edinburgh, Inst Evolutionary Biol, Edinburgh EH9 3FL, Midlothian, Scotland; [Oen, Thomas M.] AquaGen, NO-7462 Trondheim, Norway; [Niemelae, Eero; Orell, Panu; Romakkaniemi, Atso; Erkinaro, Jaakko] Nat Resources Inst Finland, FI-90014 Oulu, Finland; [Saegrov, Harald; Urdal, Kurt] Radgivende Biologer, NO-5003 Bergen, Norway","Lien, S (reprint author), Norwegian Univ Life Sci, Dept Anim & Aquacultural Sci, Ctr Integrat Genet CIGENE, NO-1432 As, Norway.",sigbjorn.lien@nmbu.no; Craig.primmer@utu.fi,"Bolstad, Geir H./K-3631-2014; Primmer, Craig/B-8179-2008","Bolstad, Geir H./0000-0003-1356-8239; Primmer, Craig/0000-0002-3687-8435; Nome, Torfinn/0000-0003-1659-132X; Johnston, Susan/0000-0002-5623-8902","Finnish Academy [137710, 141231, 272836, 284941]; Research Council of Norway [216105, 221734/O30]; AquaGen","We thank L.

In proteins, the sulfur-containing amino acid methionine is converted to methionine sulfoxide, which can cause a loss of biological activity. To rescue proteins with methionine sulfoxide residues, living cells express methionine sulfoxide reductases (Msrs) in most subcellular compartments, including the cytosol, mitochondria and chloroplasts(1-3). Here we report the identification of an enzymatic system, MsrPQ, repairing proteins containing methionine sulfoxide in the bacterial cell envelope, a compartment particularly exposed to the reactive species of oxygen and chlorine generated by the host defence mechanisms. MsrP, a molybdo-enzyme, and MsrQ, a haem-binding membrane protein, are widely conserved throughout Gram-negative bacteria, including major human pathogens. MsrPQ synthesis is induced by hypochlorous acid, a powerful antimicrobial released by neutrophils. Consistently, MsrPQ is essential for the maintenance of envelope integrity under bleach stress, rescuing a wide series of structurally unrelated periplasmic proteins from methionine oxidation, including the primary periplasmic chaperone SurA. For this activity, MsrPQ uses electrons from the respiratory chain, which represents a novel mechanism to import reducing equivalents into the bacterial cell envelope. A remarkable feature of MsrPQ is its capacity to reduce both rectus (R-) and sinister (S-) diastereoisomers of methionine sulfoxide, making this oxidoreductase complex functionally different from previously identified Msrs. The discovery that a large class of bacteria contain a single, non-stereospecific enzymatic complex fully protecting methionine residues from oxidation should prompt a search for similar systems in eukaryotic subcellular oxidizing compartments, including the endoplasmic reticulum.","[Gennaris, Alexandra; Agrebi, Rym; Leverrier, Pauline; Szewczyk, Joanna; Collet, Jean-Francois] WELBIO, B-1200 Brussels, Belgium; [Gennaris, Alexandra; Agrebi, Rym; Leverrier, Pauline; Szewczyk, Joanna; Vertommen, Didier; Collet, Jean-Francois] Catholic Univ Louvain, Duve Inst, B-1200 Brussels, Belgium; [Gennaris, Alexandra; Agrebi, Rym; Leverrier, Pauline; Szewczyk, Joanna; Collet, Jean-Francois] Brussels Ctr Redox Biol, B-1200 Brussels, Belgium; [Ezraty, Benjamin; Henry, Camille; Vergnes, Alexandra; Bos, Julia; Espinosa, Leon; Barras, Frederic] Aix Marseille Univ, CNRS, Lab Chim Bacterienne, UMR 7283,Inst Microbiol Mediterranee, F-13009 Marseille, France; [Oheix, Emmanuel; Iranzo, Olga] Aix Marseille Univ, Cent Marseille, CNRS, iSm2,UMR 7313, F-13397 Marseille, France","Collet, JF (reprint author), WELBIO, Ave Hippocrate 75, B-1200 Brussels, Belgium.",jfcollet@uclouvain.be; barras@imm.cnrs.fr,,"Leverrier, Pauline/0000-0003-2465-8491; Collet, Jean-Francois/0000-0001-8069-7036; Vertommen, Didier/0000-0001-7648-8282","Indo-French Center for the Promotion of Advanced Research CEFIPRA [5105-2]; Fonds Maurange, Fondation Roi Baudouin; FRS-FNRS; European Research Council [282335-Sulfenic]; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Fondation pour la Recherche Medicale (FRM); Aix-Marseille Universite","We thank A.

The now well-established dependency of cancer cells on their microenvironment(1) suggests that targeting the non-cancer-cell component of the tumour might form a basis for the development of novel therapeutic approaches. However, the as-yet poorly characterized contribution of host responses during tumour growth and metastatic progression represents a limitation to exploiting this approach. Here we identify neutrophils as the main component and driver of metastatic establishment within the (pre-) metastatic lung microenvironment in mouse breast cancer models. Neutrophils have a fundamental role in inflammatory responses and their contribution to tumorigenesis is still controversial(2-4). Using various strategies to block neutrophil recruitment to the pre-metastatic site, we demonstrate that neutrophils specifically support metastatic initiation. Importantly, we find that neutrophil-derived leukotrienes aid the colonization of distant tissues by selectively expanding the sub-pool of cancer cells that retain high tumorigenic potential. Genetic or pharmacological inhibition of the leukotriene-generating enzyme arachidonate 5-lipoxygenase (Alox5) abrogates neutrophil pro-metastatic activity and consequently reduces metastasis. Our results reveal the efficacy of using targeted therapy against a specific tumour microenvironment component and indicate that neutrophil Alox5 inhibition may limit metastatic progression.","[Wculek, Stefanie K.; Malanchi, Ilaria] Francis Crick Inst, Lincolns Inn Fields Labs, London WC2A 3LY, England","Malanchi, I (reprint author), Francis Crick Inst, Lincolns Inn Fields Labs, 44 Lincolns Inn Fields, London WC2A 3LY, England.",ilaria.malanchi@crick.ac.uk,"Wculek, Stefanie/F-9626-2016","Wculek, Stefanie/0000-0001-5565-8561",Cancer Research UK,"We thank C.

Clinical phenotypes range from localized tumours with excellent outcomes to widely metastatic disease in which long-term survival is approximately 40% despite intensive therapy. A previous genome-wide association study identified common polymorphisms at the LMO1 gene locus that are highly associated with neuroblastoma susceptibility and oncogenic addiction to LMO1 in the tumour cells(1). Here we investigate the causal DNA variant at this locus and the mechanism by which it leads to neuroblastoma tumorigenesis. We first imputed all possible genotypes across the LMO1 locus and then mapped highly associated single nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs) to areas of chromatin accessibility, evolutionary conservation and transcription factor binding sites. We show that SNP rs2168101 G>T is the most highly associated variant (combined P = 7.47 x 10(-29), odds ratio 0.65, 95% confidence interval 0.60-0.70), and resides in a super-enhancer defined by extensive acetylation of histone H3 lysine 27 within the first intron of LMO1. The ancestral G allele that is associated with tumour formation resides in a conserved GATA transcription factor binding motif. We show that the newly evolved protective TATA allele is associated with decreased total LMO1 expression (P = 0.028) in neuroblastoma primary tumours, and ablates GATA3 binding (P < 0.0001). We demonstrate allelic imbalance favouring the G-containing strand in tumours heterozygous for this SNP, as demonstrated both by RNA sequencing (P < 0.0001) and reporter assays (P = 0.002). These findings indicate that a recently evolved polymorphism within a super-enhancer element in the first intron of LMO1 influences neuroblastoma susceptibility through differential GATA transcription factor binding and direct modulation of LMO1 expression in cis, and this leads to an oncogenic dependency in tumour cells.","[Oldridge, Derek A.; Crimmins, Ian; Sussman, Robyn; Winter, Cynthia; McDaniel, Lee D.; Diamond, Maura; Hart, Lori S.; Diskin, Sharon J.; Maris, John M.] Childrens Hosp Philadelphia, Div Oncol, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Oldridge, Derek A.; Crimmins, Ian; Sussman, Robyn; Winter, Cynthia; McDaniel, Lee D.; Diamond, Maura; Hart, Lori S.; Diskin, Sharon J.; Maris, John M.] Childrens Hosp Philadelphia, Ctr Childhood Canc Res, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Oldridge, Derek A.] Univ Penn, Perelman Sch Med, Med Scientist Training Program, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Wood, Andrew C.] Univ Auckland, Dept Mol Med & Pathol, Auckland 1, Auckland Region, New Zealand; [Weichert-Leahey, Nina; Durbin, Adam D.; Look, A.

Although many homologous recombination factors are cell-cycle regulated, the identity of the events that are both necessary and sufficient to suppress recombination in G1 cells is unknown. Here we report that the cell cycle controls the interaction of BRCA1 with PALB2-BRCA2 to constrain BRCA2 function to the S/G2 phases in human cells. We found that the BRCA1-interaction site on PALB2 is targeted by an E3 ubiquitin ligase composed of KEAP1, a PALB2-interacting protein(5), in complex with cullin-3 (CUL3)-RBX1 (ref.6). PALB2 ubiquitylation suppresses its interaction with BRCA1 and is counteracted by the deubiquitylase USP11, which is itself under cell cycle control. Restoration of the BRCA1-PALB2 interaction combined with the activation of DNA-end resection is sufficient to induce homologous recombination in G1, as measured by RAD51 recruitment, unscheduled DNA synthesis and a CRISPR-Cas9-based gene-targeting assay. We conclude that the mechanism prohibiting homologous recombination in G1 minimally consists of the suppression of DNA-end resection coupled with a multi-step block of the recruitment of BRCA2 to DNA damage sites that involves the inhibition of BRCA1-PALB2-BRCA2 complex assembly. We speculate that the ability to induce homologous recombination in G1 cells with defined factors could spur the development of gene-targeting applications in non-dividing cells.","[Orthwein, Alexandre; Noordermeer, Sylvie M.; Wilson, Marcus D.; Landry, Sebastien; Sherker, Alana; Munro, Meagan; Durocher, Daniel] Mt Sinai Hosp, Lunenfeld Tanenbaum Res Inst, Toronto, ON M5G 1X5, Canada; [Enchev, Radoslav I.; Peter, Matthias] ETH, Inst Biochem, Dept Biol, CH-8093 Zurich, Switzerland; [Sherker, Alana; Durocher, Daniel] Univ Toronto, Dept Mol Genet, Toronto, ON M5S 3E1, Canada; [Pinder, Jordan; Salsman, Jayme; Dellaire, Graham] Dalhousie Univ, Dept Pathol, Halifax, NS B3H 4R2, Canada; [Pinder, Jordan; Salsman, Jayme; Dellaire, Graham] Dalhousie Univ, Dept Biochem & Mol Biol, Halifax, NS B3H 4R2, Canada; [Xia, Bing] Rutgers State Univ, Rutgers Canc Inst New Jersey, Dept Radiat Oncol, New Brunswick, NJ 08901 USA; [Xia, Bing] Rutgers State Univ, Robert Wood Johnson Med Sch, New Brunswick, NJ 08901 USA","Durocher, D (reprint author), Mt Sinai Hosp, Lunenfeld Tanenbaum Res Inst, 600 Univ Ave, Toronto, ON M5G 1X5, Canada.",durocher@lunenfeld.ca,"Durocher, Daniel/A-7733-2010","Durocher, Daniel/0000-0003-3863-8635; Wilson, Marcus/0000-0001-9551-5514; Dellaire, Graham/0000-0002-3466-6316; Noordermeer, Sylvie/0000-0003-2737-9690","Dutch Cancer Society (KWF); Human Frontier Science Program fellowship; Ontario Graduate Scholarship; Marie Curie postdoctoral fellowship; Beatrice Hunter Cancer Research Institute (BHCRI); Harvey Graham Cancer Research Fund as part of the Terry Fox Foundation Strategic Health Research Training Program in Cancer Research at the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR); Krembil Foundation; CIHR [FDN143343, MOP84260]","We are grateful to R.

Many challenging open problems, such as the Haldane conjecture, the question of the existence of gapped topological spin liquid phases, and the Yang-Mills gap conjecture, concern spectral gaps. These and other problems are particular cases of the general spectral gap problem: given the Hamiltonian of a quantum many-body system, is it gapped or gapless? Here we prove that this is an undecidable problem. Specifically, we construct families of quantum spin systems on a two-dimensional lattice with translationally invariant, nearest-neighbour interactions, for which the spectral gap problem is undecidable. This result extends to undecidability of other low-energy properties, such as the existence of algebraically decaying ground-state correlations. The proof combines Hamiltonian complexity techniques with aperiodic tilings, to construct a Hamiltonian whose ground state encodes the evolution of a quantum phase-estimation algorithm followed by a universal Turing machine. The spectral gap depends on the outcome of the corresponding 'halting problem'. Our result implies that there exists no algorithm to determine whether an arbitrary model is gapped or gapless, and that there exist models for which the presence or absence of a spectral gap is independent of the axioms of mathematics.","[Cubitt, Toby S.] UCL, Dept Comp Sci, London WC1E 6BT, England; [Cubitt, Toby S.] Univ Cambridge, Ctr Math Sci, DAMTP, Cambridge CB3 0WA, England; [Perez-Garcia, David] Univ Complutense Madrid, Fac CC Matemat, Dept Anal Matemat, E-28040 Madrid, Spain; [Perez-Garcia, David] Univ Complutense Madrid, Fac CC Matemat, IMI, E-28040 Madrid, Spain; [Perez-Garcia, David] ICMAT, Madrid 28049, Spain; [Wolf, Michael M.] Tech Univ Munich, Dept Math, D-85748 Garching, Germany","Cubitt, TS (reprint author), UCL, Dept Comp Sci, Gower St, London WC1E 6BT, England.",t.cubitt@ucl.ac.uk,"Wolf, Michael/J-8135-2016; Perez-Garcia, David/F-7892-2011","Wolf, Michael/0000-0002-1862-6912; Perez-Garcia, David/0000-0003-2990-791X; Cubitt, Toby/0000-0002-5087-9346","Royal Society; MINECO [MTM2011-26912, PRI-PIMCHI-2011-1071]; Comunidad de Madrid [S2013/ICE-2801]; European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union [648913]; John Templeton Foundation [48322]","T.S.C. thanks IBM.

Here we identify Ca2+ signalling as a central regulator of intestinal stem cell (ISC) activity in Drosophila. We show that dietary l-glutamate stimulates ISC division and gut growth. The metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR) is required in ISCs for this response, and for an associated modulation of cytosolic Ca2+ oscillations that results in sustained high cytosolic Ca2+ concentrations. High cytosolic Ca2+ concentrations induce ISC proliferation by regulating Calcineurin and CREB-regulated transcriptional co-activator (Crtc). In response to a wide range of dietary and stress stimuli, ISCs reversibly transition between Ca2+ oscillation states that represent poised or activated modes of proliferation, respectively. We propose that the dynamic regulation of intracellular Ca2+ levels allows effective integration of diverse mitogenic signals in ISCs to adapt their proliferative activity to the needs of the tissue.","[Deng, Hansong; Gerencser, Akos A.; Jasper, Heinrich] Buck Inst Res Aging, Novato, CA 94945 USA","Jasper, H (reprint author), Buck Inst Res Aging, 8001 Redwood Blvd, Novato, CA 94945 USA.",hjasper@buckinstitute.org,,,National Institute on Aging [R01 AG028127]; National Institute on General Medical Sciences [R01 GM100196]; Glenn Foundation for Medical Research postdoctoral fellowship; National Institutes of Health (NIH) [S10OD010414],"This work was supported by the National Institute on Aging (R01 AG028127), the National Institute on General Medical Sciences (R01 GM100196), and by a Glenn Foundation for Medical Research postdoctoral fellowship to H.D.

To further elucidate regulatory pathways that safeguard the somatic state, we performed two comprehensive RNA interference (RNAi) screens targeting chromatin factors during transcription-factor-mediated reprogramming of mouse fibroblasts to induced pluripotent stem cells (iPS cells). Subunits of the chromatin assembly factor-1 (CAF-1) complex, including Chaf1a and Chaf1b, emerged as the most prominent hits from both screens, followed by modulators of lysine sumoylation and heterochromatin maintenance. Optimal modulation of both CAF-1 and transcription factor levels increased reprogramming efficiency by several orders of magnitude and facilitated iPS cell formation in as little as 4 days. Mechanistically, CAF-1 suppression led to a more accessible chromatin structure at enhancer elements early during reprogramming. These changes were accompanied by a decrease in somatic heterochromatin domains, increased binding of Sox2 to pluripotency-specific targets and activation of associated genes. Notably, suppression of CAF-1 also enhanced the direct conversion of B cells into macrophages and fibroblasts into neurons. Together, our findings reveal the histone chaperone CAF-1 to be a novel regulator of somatic cell identity during transcription-factor-induced cell-fate transitions and provide a potential strategy to modulate cellular plasticity in a regenerative setting.","[Cheloufi, Sihem; Wesche, Daniel J.; Abazova, Nadezhda; Hogue, Max; Brumbaugh, Justin; Hochedlinger, Konrad] Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Ctr Canc, Dept Mol Biol, Boston, MA 02114 USA; [Cheloufi, Sihem; Wesche, Daniel J.; Abazova, Nadezhda; Hogue, Max; Brumbaugh, Justin; Hochedlinger, Konrad] Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Ctr Regenerat Med, Boston, MA 02114 USA; [Cheloufi, Sihem; Tenen, Danielle; Wesche, Daniel J.; Abazova, Nadezhda; Hogue, Max; Brumbaugh, Justin; Rinn, John; Hochedlinger, Konrad] Dept Stem Cell & Regenerat Biol, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Cheloufi, Sihem; Tenen, Danielle; Wesche, Daniel J.; Abazova, Nadezhda; Hogue, Max; Brumbaugh, Justin; Rinn, John; Hochedlinger, Konrad] Harvard Stem Cell Inst, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Cheloufi, Sihem; Wesche, Daniel J.; Abazova, Nadezhda; Hogue, Max; Brumbaugh, Justin; Chang, Howard Y.; Lowe, Scott W.; Hochedlinger, Konrad] Howard Hughes Med Inst, Chevy Chase, MD 20815 USA; [Elling, Ulrich; Hubmann, Maria; Wenzel, Daniel; Zinner, Marietta; Bell, Oliver; Penninger, Josef M.] Austrian Acad Sci IMBA, Inst Mol Biotechnol, Vienna Bioctr VBC, A-1030 Vienna, Austria; [Hopfgartner, Barbara; Rathert, Philipp; Jude, Julian; Fellner, Michaela; Zuber, Johannes] Res Inst Mol Pathol IMP, Vienna Bioctr VBC, A-1030 Vienna, Austria; [Jung, Youngsook L.; Ferrari, Francesco; Park, Peter J.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Biomed Informat, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Jung, Youngsook L.; Ferrari, Francesco; Park, Peter J.] Brigham & Womens Hosp, Div Genet, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Murn, Jernej; Badeaux, Aimee I.; Blanco, Andres; Shi, Yang] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Cell Biol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Murn, Jernej; Badeaux, Aimee I.; Blanco, Andres; Shi, Yang] Boston Childrens Hosp, Div Newborn Med, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Ninova, Maria; Aravin, Alexei] CALTECH, Div Biol & Biol Engn, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA; [Ang, Cheen Euong; Wernig, Marius] Stanford Univ, Inst Stem Cell Biol & Regenerat Med, Dept Pathol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Ang, Cheen Euong; Wernig, Marius] Stanford Univ, Dept Bioengn, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Tenen, Danielle; Rinn, John] Broad Inst Massachusetts Inst Technol & Harvard, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; [Tasdemir, Nilgun; Lowe, Scott W.] Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, New York, NY 10065 USA; [Vidal, Simon E.; Stadtfeld, Matthias] NYU, Sch Med, Skirball Inst Biomol Med, Helen L & Martin S Kimmel Ctr Biol & Med,Dept Cel, New York, NY 10016 USA; [Chang, Howard Y.] Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Ctr Personal Dynam Regulomes, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Chang, Howard Y.] Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Program Epithelial Biol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Almouzni, Genevieve] Inst Curie, Ctr Rech, F-75248 Paris, France","Hochedlinger, K (reprint author), Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Ctr Canc, Dept Mol Biol, Boston, MA 02114 USA.",johannes.zuber@imp.ac.at; khochedlinger@mgh.harvard.edu,"; Ferrari, Francesco/H-5007-2012; Penninger, Josef/I-6860-2013","Abazova, Nade/0000-0003-3540-9394; Stadtfeld, Matthias/0000-0002-5852-9906; Ninova, Maria/0000-0001-5051-5502; Ferrari, Francesco/0000-0002-9811-3753; Penninger, Josef/0000-0002-8194-3777; Bell, Oliver/0000-0002-7639-5948","PRCRP at the Department of Defense [CA 120212]; NIH [P50-HG007735, R01 HD058013-06]; IMBA; Austrian National Foundation; cancer center support grant; NCI; ERC GA [341036]; Innovator Award/Era of Hope Award [W81XWH-12-1-0093]; ERC [336860]; Boehringer Ingelheim; MGH; HHMI; Gerald and Darlene Jordan Chair in Regenerative Medicine","We thank B.

Despite the information available about molecular factors mediating the suppressive function of T-reg cells, the relevant cellular events in intact tissues remain largely unexplored, and whether Treg cells prevent activation of self-specific T cells or primarily limit damage from such cells has not been determined. Here we use multiplex, quantitative imaging in mice to show that, within secondary lymphoid tissues, highly suppressive Treg cells expressing phosphorylated STAT5 exist in discrete clusters with rare IL-2-positive T cells that are activated by self-antigens. This local IL-2 induction of STAT5 phosphorylation in T-reg cells is part of a feedback circuit that limits further autoimmune responses. Inducible ablation of T cell receptor expression by T-reg cells reduces their regulatory capacity and disrupts their localization in clusters, resulting in uncontrolled effector T cell responses. Our data thus reveal that autoreactive T cells are activated to cytokine production on a regular basis, with physically co-clustering T cell receptor-stimulated T-reg cells responding in a negative feedback manner to suppress incipient autoimmunity and maintain immune homeostasis.","[Liu, Zhiduo; Gerner, Michael Y.; Van Panhuys, Nicholas; Germain, Ronald N.] NIAID, Lymphocyte Biol Sect, Lab Syst Biol, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Levine, Andrew G.; Rudensky, Alexander Y.] Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Howard Hughes Med Inst, New York, NY 10065 USA; [Levine, Andrew G.; Rudensky, Alexander Y.] Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Immunol Program, New York, NY 10065 USA","Germain, RN (reprint author), NIAID, Lymphocyte Biol Sect, Lab Syst Biol, NIH, 9000 Rockville Pike, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA.",rgermain@nih.gov,"van Panhuys, Nicholas/E-1812-2011","van Panhuys, Nicholas/0000-0003-2199-852X","NIAID, NIH; US National Institutes of Health [R37AI034206, T32GM007739]; Ludwig Cancer Center at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center; Howard Hughes Medical Institute","We thank Y.

Thermal evolution models suggest that it is a differentiated body with potential geological activity(2,3). Unlike on the icy satellites of Jupiter and Saturn, where tidal forces are responsible for spewing briny water into space, no tidal forces are acting on Ceres. In the absence of such forces, most objects in the main asteroid belt are expected to be geologically inert. The recent discovery(4) of water vapour absorption near Ceres and previous detection of bound water and OH near and on Ceres (refs 5-7) have raised interest in the possible presence of surface ice. Here we report the presence of localized bright areas on Ceres from an orbiting imager(8). These unusual areas are consistent with hydrated magnesium sulfates mixed with dark background material, although other compositions are possible. Of particular interest is a bright pit on the floor of crater Occator that exhibits probable sublimation of water ice, producing haze clouds inside the crater that appear and disappear with a diurnal rhythm. Slow-moving condensed-ice or dust particles(9,10) may explain this haze. We conclude that Ceres must have accreted material from beyond the 'snow line' 11, which is the distance from the Sun at which water molecules condense.","[Nathues, A.; Hoffmann, M.; Schaefer, M.; Le Corre, L.; Reddy, V.; Platz, T.; Christensen, U.; Schaefer, T.; Ripken, J.; Sierks, H.; Thangjam, G.

Water in clay minerals(3), ammoniated phyllosilicates(4), or a mixture of Mg(OH)(2) (brucite), Mg2CO3 and iron-rich serpentine(5,6) have all been proposed to exist on the surface. In particular, brucite has been suggested from analysis of the mid-infrared spectrum of Ceres(6). But the lack of spectral data across telluric absorption bands in the wavelength region 2.5 to 2.9 micrometres-where the OH stretching vibration and the H2O bending overtone are found-has precluded definitive identifications. In addition, water vapour around Ceres has recently been reported(7), possibly originating from localized sources. Here we report spectra of Ceres from 0.4 to 5 micrometres acquired at distances from similar to 82,000 to 4,300 kilometres from the surface. Our measurements indicate widespread ammoniated phyllosilicates across the surface, but no detectable water ice. Ammonia, accreted either as organic matter or as ice, may have reacted with phyllosilicates on Ceres during differentiation. This suggests that material from the outer Solar System was incorporated into Ceres, either during its formation at great heliocentric distance or by incorporation of material transported into the main asteroid belt.","[De Sanctis, M.

Striking effects might also be expected in the case of bifunctional catalysts, which are important in the hydrocracking of fossil and renewable hydrocarbon sources to provide high-quality diesel fuel(5-7). Such bifunctional hydrocracking catalysts contain metal sites and acid sites, and for more than 50 years the so-called intimacy criterion(8) has dictated the maximum distance between the two types of site, beyond which catalytic activity decreases. A lack of synthesis and material-characterization methods with nanometre precision has long prevented in-depth exploration of the intimacy criterion, which has often been interpreted simply as 'the closer the better' for positioning metal and acid sites(8-11). Here we show for a bifunctional catalyst-comprising an intimate mixture of zeolite Y and alumina binder, and with platinum metal controllably deposited on either the zeolite or the binder-that closest proximity between metal and zeolite acid sites can be detrimental. Specifically, the selectivity when cracking large hydrocarbon feedstock molecules for high-quality diesel production is optimized with the catalyst that contains platinum on the binder, that is, with a nanoscale rather than closest intimacy of the metal and acid sites. Thus, cracking of the large and complex hydrocarbon molecules that are typically derived from alternative sources, such as gas-to-liquid technology, vegetable oil or algal oil(6,7), should benefit especially from bifunctional catalysts that avoid locating platinum on the zeolite (the traditionally assumed optimal location). More generally, we anticipate that the ability demonstrated here to spatially organize different active sites at the nanoscale will benefit the further development and optimization of the emerging generation of multifunctional catalysts(12-15).","[Zecevic, Jovana; de Jong, Krijn P.] Univ Utrecht, Debye Inst Nanomat Sci, Inorgan Chem & Catalysis, NL-3584 CG Utrecht, Netherlands; [Vanbutsele, Gina; Martens, Johan A.] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Ctr Surface Chem & Catalysis, B-3001 Leuven, Belgium","Martens, JA (reprint author), Katholieke Univ Leuven, Ctr Surface Chem & Catalysis, Celestijnenlaan 200F Postbus 2461, B-3001 Leuven, Belgium.",k.p.dejong@uu.nl; johan.martens@biw.kuleuven.be,"; Institute (DINS), Debye/G-7730-2014; Zecevic, Jovana/H-4553-2016; de Jong, Krijn/C-5319-2009","Martens, Johan/0000-0002-9292-2357; Zecevic, Jovana/0000-0002-7771-2319; ","NRSC-C; European Research Council, EU FP7 ERC Advanced [338846]; Flemish government via the Methusalem program","This work has been supported by the NRSC-C and the European Research Council, EU FP7 ERC Advanced Grant no. 338846.

A basic measure of hydrologic cycle intensification is the increase in global-mean precipitation per unit surface warming, which varies by a factor of three in current-generation climate models (about 1-3 per cent per kelvin)(3-5). Part of the uncertainty may originate from atmosphere-radiation interactions. As the climate warms, increases in shortwave absorption from atmospheric moistening will suppress the precipitation increase. This occurs through a reduction of the latent heating increase required to maintain a balanced atmospheric energy budget(6,7). Using an ensemble of climate models, here we show that such models tend to underestimate the sensitivity of solar absorption to variations in atmospheric water vapour, leading to an underestimation in the shortwave absorption increase and an overestimation in the precipitation increase. This sensitivity also varies considerably among models due to differences in radiative transfer parameterizations, explaining a substantial portion of model spread in the precipitation response. Consequently, attaining accurate shortwave absorption responses through improvements to the radiative transfer schemes could reduce the spread in the predicted global precipitation increase per degree warming for the end of the twenty-first century by about 35 per cent, and reduce the estimated ensemble-mean increase in this quantity by almost 40 per cent.","[DeAngelis, Anthony M.; Qu, Xin; Hall, Alex] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Atmospher & Ocean Sci, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Zelinka, Mark D.] Lawrence Livermore Natl Lab, Program Climate Model Diag & Intercomparison, Livermore, CA 94550 USA","DeAngelis, AM (reprint author), Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Atmospher & Ocean Sci, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.",adeangelis@ucla.edu,"Hall, Alex/D-8175-2014; Zelinka, Mark/C-4627-2011","Zelinka, Mark/0000-0002-6570-5445",Regional and Global Climate Modeling Program of the Office of Science of the US Department of Energy; US Department of Energy [DE-AC52-07NA27344],"All authors were supported by the Regional and Global Climate Modeling Program of the Office of Science of the US Department of Energy.

Prior studies using rotary shear apparatus(1-13) revealed a marked decrease in frictional strength, which can cause a large stress drop and strong shaking, with increasing slip rate and increasing work rate. (The mechanical work rate per unit area equals the product of the shear stress and the slip rate.) However, those important findings were obtained in experiments using rock specimens with dimensions of only several centimetres, which are much smaller than the dimensions of a natural fault (of the order of 1,000 metres). Here we use a large-scale biaxial friction apparatus with metre-sized rock specimens to investigate scale-dependent rock friction. The experiments show that rock friction in metre-sized rock specimens starts to decrease at a work rate that is one order of magnitude smaller than that in centimetre-sized rock specimens. Mechanical, visual and material observations suggest that slip-evolved stress heterogeneity on the fault accounts for the difference. On the basis of these observations, we propose that stress-concentrated areas exist in which frictional slip produces more wear materials (gouge) than in areas outside, resulting in further stress concentrations at these areas. Shear stress on the fault is primarily sustained by stress-concentrated areas that undergo a high work rate, so those areas should weaken rapidly and cause the macroscopic frictional strength to decrease abruptly. To verify this idea, we conducted numerical simulations assuming that local friction follows the frictional properties observed on centimetre-sized rock specimens. The simulations reproduced the macroscopic frictional properties observed on the metre-sized rock specimens. Given that localized stress concentrations commonly occur naturally, our results suggest that a natural fault may lose its strength faster than would be expected from the properties estimated from centimetre-sized rock samples.","[Yamashita, Futoshi; Fukuyama, Eiichi; Mizoguchi, Kazuo; Takizawa, Shigeru; Xu, Shiqing; Kawakata, Hironori] Natl Res Inst Earth Sci & Disaster Prevent NIED, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3050006, Japan; [Mizoguchi, Kazuo] Cent Res Inst Elect Power Ind, Abiko, Chiba 2701194, Japan; [Kawakata, Hironori] Ritsumeikan Univ, Coll Sci & Engn, Kusatsu 5258577, Japan","Yamashita, F (reprint author), Natl Res Inst Earth Sci & Disaster Prevent NIED, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3050006, Japan.",yamafuto@bosai.go.jp,,"Fukuyama, Eiichi/0000-0002-9405-9155",NIED; JSPS KAKENHI [23340131],"We thank A.

Adult norms of fair resource sharing vary widely across societies, suggesting that culture shapes the acquisition of fairness behaviour during childhood(4,5). Here we examine how fairness behaviour develops in children from seven diverse societies, testing children from 4 to 15 years of age (n = 866 pairs) in a standardized resource decision task(6,7). We measured two key aspects of fairness decisions: disadvantageous inequity aversion (peer receives more than self) and advantageous inequity aversion (self receives more than a peer). We show that disadvantageous inequity aversion emerged across all populations by middle childhood. By contrast, advantageous inequity aversion was more variable, emerging in three populations and only later in development. We discuss these findings in relation to questions about the universality and cultural specificity of human fairness.","[Blake, P.

In most of these reports, treatment regimens were not controlled for and conclusions could thus be confounded by the effects of various drugs on the microbiota, which may obscure microbial causes, protective factors or diagnostically relevant signals. Our study addresses disease and drug signatures in the human gut microbiome of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D). Two previous quantitative gut metagenomics studies of T2D patients that were unstratified for treatment yielded divergent conclusions regarding its associated gut microbial dysbiosis(3,4). Here we show, using 784 available human gut metagenomes, how antidiabetic medication confounds these results, and analyse in detail the effects of the most widely used antidiabetic drug metformin. We provide support for microbial mediation of the therapeutic effects of metformin through short-chain fatty acid production, as well as for potential microbiota-mediated mechanisms behind known intestinal adverse effects in the form of a relative increase in abundance of Escherichia species. Controlling for metformin treatment, we report a unified signature of gut microbiome shifts in T2D with a depletion of butyrate-producing taxa(3,4). These in turn cause functional microbiome shifts, in part alleviated by metformin-induced changes. Overall, the present study emphasizes the need to disentangle gut microbiota signatures of specific human diseases from those of medication.","[Forslund, Kristoffer; Hildebrand, Falk; Sunagawa, Shinichi; Voigt, Anita Yvonne; Hercog, Rajna; Costea, Paul Igor; Kultima, Jens Roat; Bork, Peer] European Mol Biol Lab, Struct & Computat Biol Unit, D-69117 Heidelberg, Germany; [Hildebrand, Falk; Falony, Gwen; Vieira-Silva, Sara; Raes, Jeroen] Katholieke Univ Leuven, VIB Ctr Biol Dis, B-3000 Leuven, Belgium; [Hildebrand, Falk; Raes, Jeroen] Vrije Univ Brussel, Dept Biosci Engn, B-1040 Brussels, Belgium; [Nielsen, Trine; Arumugam, Manimozhiyan; Vestergaard, Henrik; Hansen, Torben; Pedersen, Oluf] Univ Copenhagen, Fac Hlth & Med Sci, Novo Nordisk Fdn, Ctr Basic Metab Res, DK-2200 Copenhagen, Denmark; [Falony, Gwen; Vieira-Silva, Sara; Raes, Jeroen] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Rega Inst Med Res, Dept Microbiol & Immunol, Lab Mol Bacteriol, B-3000 Leuven, Belgium; [Le Chatelier, Emmanuelle; Prifti, Edi; Levenez, Florence; Dore, Joel; Ehrlich, S.

Early events involved in their genesis and the cellular context in which these events occur have thus been difficult to characterize. Here we present the first formal evidence of the shared and independent ability of basal cells and luminal progenitors, isolated from normal human mammary tissue and transduced with a single oncogene (KRASG12D), to produce serially transplantable, polyclonal, invasive ductal carcinomas within 8 weeks of being introduced either subrenally or subcutaneously into immunodeficient mice(4). DNA barcoding(5,6) of the initial cells revealed a dramatic change in the numbers and sizes of clones generated from them within 2 weeks, and the first appearance of many 'new' clones in tumours passaged into secondary recipients. Both primary and secondary tumours were phenotypically heterogeneous and primary tumours were categorized transcriptionally as 'normal-like'. This system challenges previous concepts that carcinogenesis in normal human epithelia is necessarily a slow process requiring the acquisition of multiple driver mutations. It also presents the first description of initial events that accompany the genesis and evolution of malignant human mammary cell populations, thereby contributing new understanding of the rapidity with which heterogeneity in their properties can develop.","[Nguyen, Long V.; Pellacani, Davide; Lefort, Sylvain; Kannan, Nagarajan; Makarem, Maisam; Cox, Claire L.; Kennedy, William; Beer, Philip; Balani, Sneha; Babovic, Sonja; Eaves, Connie J.] British Columbia Canc Agcy, Terry Fox Lab, Vancouver, BC V5Z 1L3, Canada; [Pellacani, Davide; Eaves, Connie J.] Univ British Columbia, Dept Med Genet, Vancouver, BC V6T 2B5, Canada; [Kannan, Nagarajan; Osako, Tomo; Aparicio, Samuel] Univ British Columbia, Dept Pathol & Lab Med, Vancouver, BC V6T 2B5, Canada; [Osako, Tomo; Aparicio, Samuel] British Columbia Canc Agcy, Dept Mol Oncol, Vancouver, BC V5Z 1L3, Canada; [Carles, Annaick; Moksa, Michelle; Bilenky, Misha; Hirst, Martin] Univ British Columbia, Dept Microbiol & Immunol, Ctr High Throughput Biol, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada; [Bilenky, Misha; Hirst, Martin] British Columbia Canc Agcy, Canadas Michael Smith Genome Sci Ctr, Vancouver, BC V5Z 1L3, Canada; [Sun, Ivan; Rosin, Miriam] Simon Fraser Univ, Biomed Physiol & Kinesiol, Burnaby, BC V5A 1S6, Canada; [Sun, Ivan; Rosin, Miriam] British Columbia Canc Agcy, Canc Control Unit, Vancouver, BC V5Z 1L3, Canada","Eaves, CJ (reprint author), British Columbia Canc Agcy, Terry Fox Lab, 675 West 10th Ave, Vancouver, BC V5Z 1L3, Canada.",ceaves@bccrc.ca,"Hirst, Martin/B-7684-2016","Kannan, Nagarajan/0000-0002-8825-2178",Canadian Cancer Society Research Institute; Canadian Breast Cancer Foundation; Canadian Breast Cancer Research Alliance; Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR); MITACS Elevate Fellowship; Molecular Oncologic Pathology Fellowship from CIHR; Terry Fox Foundation; Sumitomo Life Welfare and Culture Foundation; Mochida Memorial Foundation for Medical and Pharmaceutical Research; Takashi Tsuruo Memorial Fund; Canada Research Chair,"We thank D.

While the role of the former is clearly established, how the latter contributes to growth-promoting pathways is less understood. Macroautophagy, hereafter referred to as autophagy, is a catabolic process that plays a fundamental part in tissue homeostasis(3). We investigated the role of autophagy during bone growth, which is mediated by chondrocyte rate of proliferation, hypertrophic differentiation and extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition in growth plates(4). Here we show that autophagy is induced in growth-plate chondrocytes during post-natal development and regulates the secretion of type II collagen (Col2), the major component of cartilage ECM. Mice lacking the autophagy related gene 7 (Atg7) in chondrocytes experience endoplasmic reticulum storage of type II procollagen (PC2) and defective formation of the Col2 fibrillary network in the ECM. Surprisingly, post-natal induction of chondrocyte autophagy is mediated by the growth factor FGF18 through FGFR4 and JNK-dependent activation of the autophagy initiation complex VPS34-beclin-1. Autophagy is completely suppressed in growth plates from Fgf18(-/-) embryos, while Fgf18(+/-) heterozygous and Fgfr4(-/-) mice fail to induce autophagy during post-natal development and show decreased Col2 levels in the growth plate. Strikingly, the Fgf18(+/-) and Fgfr4(-/-) phenotypes can be rescued in vivo by pharmacological activation of autophagy, pointing to autophagy as a novel effector of FGF signalling in bone. These data demonstrate that autophagy is a developmentally regulated process necessary for bone growth, and identify FGF signalling as a crucial regulator of autophagy in chondrocytes.","[Cinque, Laura; Forrester, Alison; Bartolomeo, Rosa; Svelto, Maria; Venditti, Rossella; Montefusco, Sandro; Polishchuk, Elena; Nusco, Edoardo; Medina, Diego L.; Polishchuk, Roman; De Matteis, Maria Antonietta; Settembre, Carmine] Telethon Inst Genet & Med TIGEM, I-80078 Pozzuoli, NA, Italy; [Cinque, Laura; Forrester, Alison; Bartolomeo, Rosa; Svelto, Maria; Settembre, Carmine] Dulbecco Telethon Inst, I-80078 Pozzuoli, NA, Italy; [Forrester, Alison; Svelto, Maria; Settembre, Carmine] Univ Naples Federico II, Dept Med & Translat Sci, Med Genet Unit, I-80131 Naples, Italy; [Rossi, Antonio] Univ Pavia, Biochem Unit, Dept Mol Med, I-27100 Pavia, Italy","Settembre, C (reprint author), Telethon Inst Genet & Med TIGEM, Via Campi Flegrei 34, I-80078 Pozzuoli, NA, Italy.",settembre@tigem.it,,"SETTEMBRE, Carmine/0000-0002-5829-8589; Medina, Diego L./0000-0002-7347-2645; Venditti, Rossella/0000-0002-1884-6501",Italian Telethon Foundation [TCP12008]; Marie Curie European Reintegration Grant [PCIG13-GA-2013-618805]; STAR/Banco di Napoli; Italian Ministry of Research [FIRB RBFR13LH4X],"We thank A.

Here we show by synchrotron small-angle X-ray diffraction of frog (Rana temporaria) single skeletal muscle cells that, although the well-known thin-filament mechanism is sufficient for regulation of muscle shortening against low load, force generation against high load requires a second permissive step linked to a change in the structure of the thick filament. The resting (switched 'OFF') structure of the thick filament is characterized by helical tracks of myosin motors on the filament surface and a short backbone periodicity(2,4,5). This OFF structure is almost completely preserved during low-load shortening, which is driven by a small fraction of constitutively active (switched 'ON') myosin motors outside thick-filament control. At higher load, these motors generate sufficient thick-filament stress to trigger the transition to its long-periodicity ON structure, unlocking the major population of motors required for high-load contraction. This concept of the thick filament as a regulatory mechanosensor provides a novel explanation for the dynamic and energetic properties of skeletal muscle. A similar mechanism probably operates in the heart.","[Linari, Marco; Brunello, Elisabetta; Reconditi, Massimo; Caremani, Marco; Piazzesi, Gabriella; Lombardi, Vincenzo] Univ Florence, Dept Biol, Physiol Lab, I-50019 Florence, Italy; [Linari, Marco; Reconditi, Massimo] UdR Firenze, Consorzio Nazl Interuniv Sci Fis Mat, I-50019 Florence, Italy; [Fusi, Luca; Irving, Malcolm] Kings Coll London, Randall Div, London SE1 1UL, England; [Fusi, Luca; Irving, Malcolm] Kings Coll London, BHF Ctr Res Excellence, London SE1 1UL, England; [Narayanan, Theyencheri] European Synchrotron Radiat Facil, F-38043 Grenoble, France","Lombardi, V (reprint author), Univ Florence, Dept Biol, Physiol Lab, I-50019 Florence, Italy.",vincenzo.lombardi@unifi.it,,"Fusi, Luca/0000-0003-3992-0114; Caremani, Marco/0000-0001-9128-7227",Ente Cassa di Risparmio di Firenze [2010.1402]; FIRB-Futuro in Ricerca project [RBFR08JAMZ]; MIUR-PRIN project (Italy) [2010R8JK2X]; MRC (UK); ESRF,"We thank M.

It has recently been shown that Sara (Smad anchor for receptor activation) signalling endosomes in the cytoplasm also segregate asymmetrically during asymmetric division(1,2). Biased dispatch of Sara endosomes mediates asymmetric Notch/Delta signalling during the asymmetric division of sensory organ precursors in Drosophila(1). In flies, this has been generalized to stem cells in the gut(3) and the central nervous system(1), and, in zebrafish, to neural precursors of the spinal cord(4). However, the mechanism of asymmetric endosome segregation is not understood. Here we show that the plus-end kinesin motor Klp98A targets Sara endosomes to the central spindle, where they move bidirectionally on an antiparallel array of microtubules. The microtubule depolymerizing kinesin Klp10A and its antagonist Patronin generate central spindle asymmetry. This asymmetric spindle, in turn, polarizes endosome motility, ultimately causing asymmetric endosome dispatch into one daughter cell. We demonstrate this mechanism by inverting the polarity of the central spindle by polar targeting of Patronin using nanobodies (single-domain antibodies). This spindle inversion targets the endosomes to the wrong cell. Our data uncover the molecular and physical mechanism by which organelles localized away from the cellular cortex can be dispatched asymmetrically during asymmetric division.","[Derivery, Emmanuel; Seum, Carole; Daeden, Alicia; Loubery, Sylvain; Holtzer, Laurent; Gonzalez-Gaitan, Marcos] Univ Geneva, Fac Sci, Dept Biochem, CH-1211 Geneva, Switzerland; [Juelicher, Frank] Max Planck Inst Phys Komplexer Syst, D-01187 Dresden, Germany","Gonzalez-Gaitan, M (reprint author), Univ Geneva, Fac Sci, Dept Biochem, 30 Quai Ernest Ansermet, CH-1211 Geneva, Switzerland.",emmanuel.derivery@unige.ch; julicher@pks.mpg.de; marcos.gonzalez@unige.ch,"Holtzer, Laurent/B-9016-2008; Julicher, Frank/B-1828-2009","Julicher, Frank/0000-0003-4731-9185; Loubery, Sylvain/0000-0001-7061-9456",Human Frontier Science Program; Marie-Curie Intra-European Fellowship; Departement de l'Instruction Publique of the Canton of Geneva; SNF; SystemsX epiPhysX program; NCCR Chemical Biology program; ERC; Polish-Swiss research programs,"We thank A.

Many chromosomal rearrangements characteristic of human cancers originate from specific regions of the genome called common fragile sites (CFSs)(2-5). CFSs are difficult-to-replicate loci that manifest as gaps or breaks on metaphase chromosomes (termed CFS 'expression'), particularly when cells have been exposed to replicative stress(6). The MUS81-EME1 structure-specific endonuclease promotes the appearance of chromosome gaps or breaks at CFSs following replicative stress(7-9). Here we show that entry of cells into mitotic prophase triggers the recruitment of MUS81 to CFSs. The nuclease activity of MUS81 then promotes POLD3-dependent DNA synthesis at CFSs, which serves to minimize chromosome mis-segregation and non-disjunction. We propose that the attempted condensation of incompletely duplicated loci in early mitosis serves as the trigger for completion of DNA replication at CFS loci in human cells. Given that this POLD3-dependent mitotic DNA synthesis is enhanced in aneuploid cancer cells that exhibit intrinsically high levels of chromosomal instability (CIN+) and replicative stress, we suggest that targeting this pathway could represent a new therapeutic approach.","[Minocherhomji, Sheroy; Bjerregaard, Victoria A.; Bursomanno, Sara; Aleliunaite, Aiste; Wu, Wei; Mankouri, Hocine W.; Liu, Ying; Hickson, Ian D.] Univ Copenhagen, Panum Inst, Dept Cellular & Mol Med, Ctr Chromosome Stabil & Ctr Hlth Aging, DK-2200 Copenhagen N, Denmark; [Ying, Songmin; Shen, Huahao] Zhejiang Univ, Sch Med, Affiliated Hosp 2, Dept Resp & Crit Care Med, Hangzhou 310009, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Ying, Songmin] Zhejiang Univ, Sch Med, Dept Pharmacol, Hangzhou 310058, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Shen, Huahao] SKLRD, Guangzhou 510120, Peoples R China","Shen, HH (reprint author), Zhejiang Univ, Sch Med, Affiliated Hosp 2, Dept Resp & Crit Care Med, Hangzhou 310009, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.",huahaoshen@163.com; ying@sund.ku.dk; iandh@sund.ku.dk,,"Mankouri, Hocine/0000-0003-2092-0907","European Research Council; Danish National Research Foundation; Nordea Foundation; National 1000 Talents Program; National Natural Science Foundation of China [31370901, 81422031]; Zhejiang Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China [LR14H160001]; National Key Scientific and Technology Support Program: Collaborative innovation of Clinical Research for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and lung cancer [2013BAI09B09]; Danish Medical Research Council","We thank T.

It describes non-local correlations between quantum objects, and is at the heart of quantum information sciences. Entanglement is now being studied in diverse fields ranging from condensed matter to quantum gravity. However, measuring entanglement remains a challenge. This is especially so in systems of interacting delocalized particles, for which a direct experimental measurement of spatial entanglement has been elusive. Here, we measure entanglement in such a system of itinerant particles using quantum interference of many-body twins. Making use of our single-site-resolved control of ultracold bosonic atoms in optical lattices, we prepare two identical copies of a many-body state and interfere them. This enables us to directly measure quantum purity, Renyi entanglement entropy, and mutual information. These experiments pave the way for using entanglement to characterize quantum phases and dynamics of strongly correlated many-body systems.","[Islam, Rajibul; Ma, Ruichao; Preiss, Philipp M.; Tai, M.

Nevertheless, here we find that most shallow water marine species occupy broad thermal distributions that are aggregated in either temperate or tropical realms. These distributional trends result in ocean-scale spatial thermal biases, where communities are dominated by species with warmer or cooler affinity than local environmental temperatures. We use community-level thermal deviations from local temperatures as a form of sensitivity to warming, and combine these with projected ocean warming data to predict warming-related loss of species from present-day communities over the next century. Large changes in local species composition appear likely, and proximity to thermal limits, as inferred from present-day species' distributional ranges, outweighs spatial variation in warming rates in contributing to predicted rates of local species loss.","[Stuart-Smith, Rick D.; Edgar, Graham J.; Barrett, Neville S.; Kininmonth, Stuart J.] Univ Tasmania, Inst Marine & Antarctic Studies, Hobart, Tas 7001, Australia; [Kininmonth, Stuart J.] Stockholm Univ, Stockholm Resilience Ctr, SE-10691 Kraftriket Stockholm, Sweden; [Bates, Amanda E.] Univ Southampton, Ocean & Earth Sci, Natl Oceanog Ctr Southampton, Southampton SO14 3ZH, Hants, England","Stuart-Smith, RD (reprint author), Univ Tasmania, Inst Marine & Antarctic Studies, Hobart, Tas 7001, Australia.",rstuarts@utas.edu.au,"Barrett, Neville/J-7593-2014","Barrett, Neville/0000-0002-6167-1356; Edgar, Graham/0000-0003-0833-9001",Ian Potter Foundation; CoastWest; National Geographic Society; Conservation International; Wildlife Conservation Society Indonesia; Winston Churchill Memorial Trust; Australian-American Fulbright Commission; ASSEMBLE Marine,"We thank the many Reef Life Survey (RLS) divers who participated in data collection and provide ongoing expertise and commitment to the program, University of Tasmania staff including J.

Here we show that many tumour cells in astrocytomas extend ultra-long membrane protrusions, and use these distinct tumour microtubes as routes for brain invasion, proliferation, and to interconnect over long distances. The resulting network allows multicellular communication through microtube-associated gap junctions. When damage to the network occurred, tumour microtubes were used for repair. Moreover, the microtube-connected astrocytoma cells, but not those remaining unconnected throughout tumour progression, were protected from cell death inflicted by radiotherapy. The neuronal growth-associated protein 43 was important for microtube formation and function, and drove microtube-dependent tumour cell invasion, proliferation, interconnection, and radioresistance. Oligodendroglial brain tumours were deficient in this mechanism. In summary, astrocytomas can develop functional multicellular network structures. Disconnection of astrocytoma cells by targeting their tumour microtubes emerges as a new principle to reduce the treatment resistance of this disease.","[Osswald, Matthias; Jung, Erik; Solecki, Gergely; Blaes, Jonas; Weil, Sophie; Wiestler, Benedikt; Syed, Mustafa; Huang, Lulu; Jazi, Kianush Karimian; Schmenger, Torsten; Lemke, Dieter; Goemmel, Miriam; Liao, Yunxiang; Platten, Michael; Wick, Wolfgang; Winkler, Frank] Univ Heidelberg Hosp, Neurol Clin, D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany; [Osswald, Matthias; Jung, Erik; Solecki, Gergely; Blaes, Jonas; Weil, Sophie; Wiestler, Benedikt; Syed, Mustafa; Huang, Lulu; Jazi, Kianush Karimian; Schmenger, Torsten; Lemke, Dieter; Goemmel, Miriam; Liao, Yunxiang; Platten, Michael; Wick, Wolfgang; Winkler, Frank] Univ Heidelberg Hosp, Natl Ctr Tumor Dis, D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany; [Osswald, Matthias; Jung, Erik; Solecki, Gergely; Blaes, Jonas; Weil, Sophie; Wiestler, Benedikt; Syed, Mustafa; Huang, Lulu; Ratliff, Miriam; Jazi, Kianush Karimian; Schmenger, Torsten; Lemke, Dieter; Goemmel, Miriam; Liao, Yunxiang; Wick, Wolfgang; Winkler, Frank] German Canc Res Ctr, Clin Cooperat Unit Neurooncol, German Canc Consortium DKTK, D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany; [Sahm, Felix; Pusch, Stefan; von Deimling, Andreas] Heidelberg Univ, Inst Pathol, Dept Neuropathol, D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany; [Sahm, Felix; Pusch, Stefan; von Deimling, Andreas] German Canc Res Ctr, Clin Cooperat Unit Neuropathol, German Canc Consortium DKTK, D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany; [Venkataramani, Varun; Horstmann, Heinz; Kuner, Thomas] Heidelberg Univ, Inst Anat & Cell Biol, Dept Funct Neuroanat, D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany; [Wiestler, Benedikt] Tech Univ Munich, Klinikum Rechts Isar, Dept Diagnost & Intervent Neuroradiol, D-81675 Munich, Germany; [Ratliff, Miriam] Univ Heidelberg Hosp, Neurosurg Clin, D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany; [Kurz, Felix T.; Heiland, Sabine] Univ Heidelberg Hosp, Dept Neuroradiol, D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany; [Pauli, Martin] Univ Wurzburg, Inst Physiol, Dept Neurophysiol, D-97070 Wurzburg, Germany; [Haering, Peter] German Canc Res Ctr, Dept Med Phys, D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany; [Herl, Verena; Steinhaeuser, Christian] Univ Bonn, Inst Cellular Neurosci, Fac Med, D-53105 Bonn, Germany; [Krunic, Damir] German Canc Res Ctr, Light Microscopy Facil, D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany; [Jarahian, Mostafa] German Canc Res Ctr, Dept Translat Immunol, D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany; [Miletic, Hrvoje] Univ Bergen, Dept Biomed, N-5009 Bergen, Norway; [Berghoff, Anna S.] Med Univ Vienna, Inst Neurol, Vienna, Austria; [Berghoff, Anna S.; Preusser, Matthias] Med Univ Vienna, CNS Unit, Ctr Comprehens Canc, A-1090 Vienna, Austria; [Griesbeck, Oliver] Max Planck Inst Neurobiol, Tools Bioimaging, D-82152 Martinsried, Germany; [Kalamakis, Georgios; Garaschuk, Olga] Univ Tubingen, Inst Physiol 2, D-72074 Tubingen, Germany; [Preusser, Matthias] Med Univ Vienna, Dept Med 1, Vienna, Austria; [Weiss, Samuel] Univ Calgary, Fac Med, Hotchkiss Brain Inst, Calgary, AB T2N 4N1, Canada; [Weiss, Samuel] Univ Calgary, Fac Med, Dept Cell Biol & Anat, Calgary, AB T2N 4Z6, Canada; [Weiss, Samuel] Univ Calgary, Fac Med, Southern Alberta Canc Res Inst, Clark Smith Brain Tumor Res Ctr, Calgary, AB T2N 4N1, Canada; [Liu, Haikun] German Canc Res Ctr, DKFZ ZMBH Alliance, Normal & Neoplast CNS Stem Cells, Helmholtz Young Investigator Grp, D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany; [Platten, Michael] German Canc Res Ctr, German Canc Consortium DKTK, Clin Cooperat Unit Neuroimmunol & Brain Tumor Imm, D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany; [Huber, Peter E.] German Canc Res Ctr, CCU Mol & Radiat Oncol, D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany; [Huber, Peter E.] Univ Heidelberg Hosp, Dept Radiat Oncol, D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany","Winkler, F (reprint author), Univ Heidelberg Hosp, Neurol Clin, INF 400, D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany.",frank.winkler@med.uni-heidelberg.de,"von Deimling, Andreas/F-7774-2013","von Deimling, Andreas/0000-0002-5863-540X; Kalamakis, Georgios/0000-0003-0832-482X; Preusser, Matthias/0000-0003-3541-2315; Jung, Erik/0000-0002-5016-8202; Pusch, Stefan/0000-0002-3407-4249; liu, hai-kun/0000-0003-3338-4066; Platten, Michael/0000-0002-4746-887X",German Research Foundation (DFG) [WI 1930/5-1]; Major Equipment Grant INST [114089/26-1 FUGG]; DKFZ; Heinrich F.C.

Known as the Warburg effect in the context of cancer growth, this phenomenon occurs ubiquitously for fast-growing cells, including bacteria, fungi and mammalian cells, but its origin has remained unclear despite decades of research. Here we study metabolic overflow in Escherichia coli, and show that it is a global physiological response used to cope with changing proteomic demands of energy biogenesis and biomass synthesis under different growth conditions. A simple model of proteomic resource allocation can quantitatively account for all of the observed behaviours, and accurately predict responses to new perturbations. The key hypothesis of the model, that the proteome cost of energy biogenesis by respiration exceeds that by fermentation, is quantitatively confirmed by direct measurement of protein abundances via quantitative mass spectrometry.","[Basan, Markus; Hui, Sheng; Okano, Hiroyuki; Hwa, Terence] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Phys, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Basan, Markus] ETH, Inst Mol Syst Biol, CH-8093 Zurich, Switzerland; [Okano, Hiroyuki; Zhang, Zhongge; Shen, Yang; Hwa, Terence] Univ Calif San Diego, Mol Biol Sect, Div Biol Sci, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Williamson, James R.] Scripps Res Inst, Dept Chem, Skaggs Inst Chem Biol, Dept Integrat Struct & Computat Biol, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; [Hwa, Terence] ETH, Inst Theoret Studies, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland","Hwa, T (reprint author), Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Phys, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.",hwa@ucsd.edu,"Hwa, Terence/J-4012-2013; Williamson, James/B-2891-2009","Hwa, Terence/0000-0003-1837-6842; Williamson, James/0000-0002-8772-468X; Hui, Sheng/0000-0002-4226-6806","NIH [R01-GM109069]; Simons Foundation [330378]; M.

In the local Universe, the census of all observed baryons falls short of this estimate by a factor of two(2,3). Cosmological simulations indicate that the missing baryons have not condensed into virialized haloes, but reside throughout the filaments of the cosmic web (where matter density is larger than average) as a low-density plasma at temperatures of 10(5)-10(7) kelvin, known as the warm-hot intergalactic medium(3-6). There have been previous claims of the detection of warm-hot baryons along the line of sight to distant blazars(7-10) and of hot gas between interacting clusters(11-14). These observations were, however, unable to trace the large-scale filamentary structure, or to estimate the total amount of warm-hot baryons in a representative volume of the Universe. Here we report X-ray observations of filamentary structures of gas at 10(7) kelvin associated with the galaxy cluster Abell 2744. Previous observations of this cluster15 were unable to resolve and remove coincidental X-ray point sources. After subtracting these, we find hot gas structures that are coherent over scales of 8 megaparsecs. The filaments coincide with over-densities of galaxies and dark matter, with 5-10 per cent of their mass in baryonic gas. This gas has been heated up by the cluster's gravitational pull and is now feeding its core. Our findings strengthen evidence for a picture of the Universe in which a large fraction of the missing baryons reside in the filaments of the cosmic web.","[Eckert, Dominique; Tchernin, Celine] Univ Geneva, Dept Astron, CH-1290 Versoix, Switzerland; [Eckert, Dominique] INAF IASF Milano, I-20133 Milan, Italy; [Jauzac, Mathilde; Israel, Holger; Massey, Richard] Univ Durham, Dept Phys, Inst Computat Cosmol, Durham DH1 3LE, England; [Jauzac, Mathilde] Univ KwaZulu Natal, Sch Math Sci, Astrophys & Cosmol Res Unit, ZA-4041 Durban, South Africa; [HuanYuan, Shan; Kneib, Jean-Paul] Observ Sauverny, Ecole Polytech Fed Lausanne, Astrophys Lab, CH-1290 Versoix, Switzerland; [Kneib, Jean-Paul; Jullo, Eric] Aix Marseille Univ, CNRS, UMR 7326, LAM, F-13388 Marseille, France; [Erben, Thomas; Klein, Matthias] Argelander Inst Astron, D-53121 Bonn, Germany; [Richard, Johan] Univ Lyon 1, CRAL, Observ Lyon, F-69561 St Genis Laval, France","Eckert, D (reprint author), Univ Geneva, Dept Astron, Chemin Ecogia 16, CH-1290 Versoix, Switzerland.",Dominique.Eckert@unige.ch,"EPFL, Physics/O-6514-2016","Massey, Richard/0000-0002-6085-3780; Eckert, Dominique/0000-0001-7917-3892","ESA Member States; NASA; UK Science and Technology Facilities Council [ST/L00075X/1, ST/H005234/1]; Leverhulme trust [PLP-2011-003]; Royal Society; ERC advanced grant LIDA; CNRS; Marie Curie International Incoming Fellowship within the 7th European Community Framework Programme; NSFC of China [11103011]; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft through the Transregional Collaborative Research Centre [TR 33]; CNES; ERC starting grant CALENDS","Work reported here is based on observations obtained with XMM-Newton, an ESA science mission with instruments and contributions directly funded by ESA Member States and NASA.

Although the theory is poorly understood, observations of relativistic jets from systems known as microquasars (compact binary stars)(1,2) have led to a well established phenomenology(3,4). Relativistic jets are not expected to be produced by sources with soft or supersoft X-ray spectra, although two such systems are known to produce relatively low-velocity bipolar outflows(5,6). Here we report the optical spectra of an ultraluminous supersoft X-ray source (ULS7,8) in the nearby galaxy M81 (M81 ULS-1; refs 9, 10). Unexpectedly, the spectra show blueshifted, broad H alpha emission lines, characteristic of baryonic jets with relativistic speeds. These time-variable emission lines have projected velocities of about 17 per cent of the speed of light, and seem to be similar to those from the prototype microquasar SS 433 (refs 11, 12). Such relativistic jets are not expected to be launched from white dwarfs(13), and an origin from a black hole or a neutron star is hard to reconcile with the persistence of M81 ULS-1's soft X-rays(10). Thus the unexpected presence of relativistic jets in a ULS challenges canonical theories of jet formation(3,4), but might be explained by a long-speculated, supercritically accreting black hole with optically thick outflows(14-20).","[Liu, Ji-Feng; Bai, Yu; Wang, Song; Justham, Stephen; Lu, You-Jun; Guo, Jin-Cheng] Chinese Acad Sci, Natl Astron Observ, Key Lab Opt Astron, Beijing 100012, Peoples R China; [Liu, Ji-Feng; Justham, Stephen; Lu, You-Jun] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Coll Astron & Space Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China; [Gu, Wei-Min] Xiamen Univ, Dept Astron, Xiamen 361005, Fujian Province, Peoples R China; [Liu, Qing-Zhong] Chinese Acad Sci, Purple Mt Observ, Key Lab Dark Matter & Space Astron, Nanjing 210008, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Di Stefano, Rosanne] Harvard Smithsonian Ctr Astrophys, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Cabrera-Lavers, Antonio; Alvarez, Pedro] Inst Astrofis Canarias, E-38200 San Cristobal la Laguna, Tenerife, Spain; [Cabrera-Lavers, Antonio; Alvarez, Pedro] Univ La Laguna, Dept Astrofis, E-38205 San Cristobal la Laguna, Tenerife, Spain; [Cao, Yi; Kulkarni, Shri] CALTECH, Dept Astron, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA","Liu, JF (reprint author), Chinese Acad Sci, Natl Astron Observ, Key Lab Opt Astron, 20A Datun Rd, Beijing 100012, Peoples R China.",jfliu@nao.cas.cn,"Bai, Yu/E-2902-2016",,Chinese Academy of Sciences [XDB09000000]; 973 Program [2014CB845705]; National Science Foundation of China [NSFC-11333004/11425313]; W.M.

In particular, alpha capture on carbon determines the ratio of carbon to oxygen during helium burning, and affects subsequent carbon, neon, oxygen, and silicon burning stages. It also substantially affects models of thermonuclear type Ia supernovae, owing to carbon detonation in accreting carbon-oxygen white-dwarf stars(1-3). In these reactions, the accurate calculation of the elastic scattering of alpha particles and alpha-like nuclei-nuclei with even and equal numbers of protons and neutrons-is important for understanding background and resonant scattering contributions. First-principles calculations of processes involving alpha particles and alpha-like nuclei have so far been impractical, owing to the exponential growth of the number of computational operations with the number of particles. Here we describe an ab initio calculation of alpha-alpha scattering that uses lattice Monte Carlo simulations. We use lattice effective field theory to describe the low-energy interactions of protons and neutrons, and apply a technique called the 'adiabatic projection method' to reduce the eight-body system to a two-cluster system. We take advantage of the computational efficiency and the more favourable scaling with system size of auxiliary-field Monte Carlo simulations to compute an ab initio effective Hamiltonian for the two clusters. We find promising agreement between lattice results and experimental phase shifts for s-wave and d-wave scattering. The approximately quadratic scaling of computational operations with particle number suggests that it should be possible to compute alpha scattering and capture on carbon and oxygen in the near future. The methods described here can be applied to ultracold atomic few-body systems as well as to hadronic systems using lattice quantum chromodynamics to describe the interactions of quarks and gluons.","[Elhatisari, Serdar; Luu, Thomas; Meissner, Ulf-G.] Univ Bonn, Helmholtz Inst Strahlen & Kernphys, D-53115 Bonn, Germany; [Elhatisari, Serdar; Luu, Thomas; Meissner, Ulf-G.] Univ Bonn, Bethe Ctr Theoret Phys, D-53115 Bonn, Germany; [Lee, Dean] N Carolina State Univ, Dept Phys, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA; [Rupak, Gautam] Mississippi State Univ, Dept Phys & Astron, Mississippi State, MS 39762 USA; [Rupak, Gautam] Mississippi State Univ, Ctr Computat Sci HPC2, Mississippi State, MS 39762 USA; [Epelbaum, Evgeny; Krebs, Hermann] Ruhr Univ Bochum, Inst Theoret Phys 2, D-44870 Bochum, Germany; [Laehde, Timo A.; Luu, Thomas; Meissner, Ulf-G.] Forschungszentrum Julich, Inst Adv Simulat, Inst Kernphys, D-52425 Julich, Germany; [Laehde, Timo A.; Luu, Thomas; Meissner, Ulf-G.] Forschungszentrum Julich, Julich Ctr Hadron Phys, D-52425 Julich, Germany; [Meissner, Ulf-G.] Forschungszentrum Julich, JARA High Performance Comp, D-52425 Julich, Germany","Lee, D (reprint author), N Carolina State Univ, Dept Phys, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA.",dean_lee@ncsu.edu,,"Lahde, Timo Arvid/0000-0003-3251-1035",Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (Sino-German) [CRC 110]; Helmholtz Association [VH-VI-417]; BMBF [05P12PDFTE]; US Department of Energy [DE-FG02-03ER41260]; US National Science Foundation [PHY-1307453]; EU HadronPhysics3 project; ERC [259218 NUCLEAREFT]; Magnus Ehrnrooth Foundation of the Finnish Society of Sciences and Letters,"We acknowledge discussions with G.

There is growing evidence(2-4) that MISI may be underway throughout the Amundsen Sea embayment (ASE), which contains ice equivalent to more than a metre of global sea-level rise. If triggered in other regions(5-8), the centennial to millennial contribution could be several metres. Physically plausible projections are challenging(9): numerical models with sufficient spatial resolution to simulate grounding-line processes have been too computationally expensive(2,3,10) to generate large ensembles for uncertainty assessment, and lower-resolution model projections(11) rely on parameterizations that are only loosely constrained by present day changes. Here we project that the Antarctic ice sheet will contribute up to 30 cm sea-level equivalent by 2100 and 72 cm by 2200 (95% quantiles) where the ASE dominates. Our process-based, statistical approach gives skewed and complex probability distributions (single mode, 10 cm, at 2100; two modes, 49 cm and 6 cm, at 2200). The dependence of sliding on basal friction is a key unknown: nonlinear relationships favour higher contributions. Results are conditional on assessments of MISI risk on the basis of projected triggers under the climate scenario A1B (ref. 9), although sensitivity to these is limited by theoretical and topographical constraints on the rate and extent of ice loss. We find that contributions are restricted by a combination of these constraints, calibration with success in simulating observed ASE losses, and low assessed risk in some basins. Our assessment suggests that upper-bound estimates from low-resolution models and physical arguments9 (up to a metre by 2100 and around one and a half by 2200) are implausible under current understanding of physical mechanisms and potential triggers.","[Ritz, Catherine; Durand, Gael; Peyaud, Vincent] CNRS, LGGE, F-38041 Grenoble, France; [Ritz, Catherine; Durand, Gael; Peyaud, Vincent] Univ Grenoble Alpes, LGGE, F-38041 Grenoble, France; [Edwards, Tamsin L.] Open Univ, Fac Sci, Dept Environm Earth & Ecosyst, Milton Keynes MK7 6AA, Bucks, England; [Edwards, Tamsin L.; Payne, Antony J.] Univ Bristol, Dept Geog Sci, Bristol BS8 1SS, Avon, England; [Hindmarsh, Richard C.

It has been suggested that reduced availability of non-structural carbohydrates (NSC) critically increases mortality risk through insufficient carbon supply to metabolism ('carbon starvation')(7,8). However, little is known about how NSC stores are affected by drought, especially over the long term, and whether they are more important than hydraulic processes in determining drought-induced mortality. Using data from the world's longest-running experimental drought study in tropical rainforest (in the Brazilian Amazon), we test whether carbon starvation or deterioration of the water-conducting pathways from soil to leaf trigger tree mortality. Biomass loss from mortality in the experimentally droughted forest increased substantially after > 10 years of reduced soil moisture availability. The mortality signal was dominated by the death of large trees, which were at a much greater risk of hydraulic deterioration than smaller trees. However, we find no evidence that the droughted trees suffered carbon starvation, as their NSC concentrations were similar to those of non-droughted trees, and growth rates did not decline in either living or dying trees. Our results indicate that hydraulics, rather than carbon starvation, triggers tree death from drought in tropical rainforest.","[Rowland, L.; Binks, O.

MECP2 duplication syndrome is one of the most common genomic rearrangements in males(2) and is characterized by autism, intellectual disability, motor dysfunction, anxiety, epilepsy, recurrent respiratory tract infections and early death(3-5). The broad range of deficits caused by methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MeCP2) overexpression poses a daunting challenge to traditional biochemical-pathway-based therapeutic approaches. Accordingly, we sought strategies that directly target MeCP2 and are amenable to translation into clinical therapy. The first question that we addressed was whether the neurological dysfunction is reversible after symptoms set in. Reversal of phenotypes in adult symptomatic mice has been demonstrated in some models of monogenic loss-of-function neurological disorders(6-8), including loss of MeCP2 in Rett syndrome(9), indicating that, at least in some cases, the neuroanatomy may remain sufficiently intact so that correction of the molecular dysfunction underlying these disorders can restore healthy physiology. Given the absence of neurodegeneration in MECP2 duplication syndrome, we propose that restoration of normal MeCP2 levels in MECP2 duplication adult mice would rescue their phenotype. By generating and characterizing a conditional Mecp2-overexpressing mouse model, here we show that correction of MeCP2 levels largely reverses the behavioural, molecular and electrophysiological deficits. We also reduced MeCP2 using an antisense oligonucleotide strategy, which has greater translational potential. Antisense oligonucleotides are small, modified nucleic acids that can selectively hybridize with messenger RNA transcribed from a target gene and silence it(10,11), and have been successfully used to correct deficits in different mouse models(12-18). We find that antisense oligonucleotide treatment induces a broad phenotypic rescue in adult symptomatic transgenic MECP2 duplication mice (MECP2-TG)(19,20), and corrected MECP2 levels in lymphoblastoid cells from MECP2 duplication patients in a dose-dependent manner.","[Sztainberg, Yehezkel; Zoghbi, Huda Y.] Baylor Coll Med, Dept Mol & Human Genet, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Sztainberg, Yehezkel; Hao, Shuang; Tang, Bin; Wu, Zhenyu; Tang, Jianrong; Wan, Ying-Wooi; Liu, Zhandong; Zoghbi, Huda Y.] Texas Childrens Hosp, Jan & Dan Duncan Neurol Res Inst, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Chen, Hong-mei; Swann, John W.] Texas Childrens Hosp, Jan & Dan Duncan Neurol Res Inst, Cain Fdn Labs, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Chen, Hong-mei; Swann, John W.] Baylor Coll Med, Dept Neurosci, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Chen, Hong-mei; Swann, John W.; Hao, Shuang; Tang, Bin; Wu, Zhenyu; Tang, Jianrong; Liu, Zhandong; Zoghbi, Huda Y.] Baylor Coll Med, Dept Pediat, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Wan, Ying-Wooi] Baylor Coll Med, Dept Obstet & Gynecol, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Rigo, Frank] ISIS Pharmaceut, Carlsbad, CA 92010 USA; [Zoghbi, Huda Y.] Baylor Coll Med, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Houston, TX 77030 USA","Zoghbi, HY (reprint author), Baylor Coll Med, Dept Mol & Human Genet, Houston, TX 77030 USA.",hzoghbi@bcm.edu,,,"National Institutes of Health [5R01NS057819, 5P30HD024064]; Rett Syndrome Research Trust (401 Project); Carl.

Mucociliary clearance(2,3) in mammalian respiratory airways depends on secretory cells (club and goblet) and ciliated cells to produce and transport mucus. During development or repair, the closely related Jagged ligands (JAG1 and JAG2) induce Notch signalling to determine the fate of these lineages as they descend from a common proliferating progenitor(4-8). In contrast to such situations in which cell fate decisions are made in rapidly dividing populations(9,10), cells of the homeostatic adult airway epithelium are long-lived(11-13), and little is known about the role of active Notch signalling under such conditions. To disrupt Jagged signalling acutely in adult mammals, here we generate antibody antagonists that selectively target each Jagged paralogue, and determine a crystal structure that explains selectivity. We show that acute Jagged blockade induces a rapid and near-complete loss of club cells, with a concomitant gain in ciliated cells, under homeostatic conditions without increased cell death or division. Fate analyses demonstrate a direct conversion of club cells to ciliated cells without proliferation, meeting a conservative definition of direct transdifferentiation(14).

Precursor cells expressing TCRs within a certain low-affinity range for complexes of self-peptide and major histocompatibility complex (MHC) undergo positive selection and differentiate into naive T cells expressing a highly diverse self-MHC-restricted TCR repertoire. In contrast, precursors displaying TCRs with a high affinity for 'self' are either eliminated through TCR-agonist-induced apoptosis (negative selection)(1) or restrained by regulatory T (T-reg) cells, whose differentiation and function are controlled by the X-chromosome-encoded transcription factor Foxp3 (reviewed in ref. 2). Foxp3 is expressed in a fraction of self-reactive T cells that escape negative selection in response to agonist-driven TCR signals combined with interleukin 2 (IL-2) receptor signalling. In addition to Treg cells, TCR-agonist-driven selection results in the generation of several other specialized T-cell lineages such as natural killer T cells and innate mucosal-associated invariant T cells(3). Although the latter exhibit a restricted TCR repertoire, Treg cells display a highly diverse collection of TCRs(4-6). Here we explore in mice whether a specialized mechanism enables agonist-driven selection of T-reg cells with a diverse TCR repertoire, and the importance this holds for self-tolerance. We show that the intronic Foxp3 enhancer conserved noncoding sequence 3 (CNS3) acts as an epigenetic switch that confers a poised state to the Foxp3 promoter in precursor cells to make T-reg cell lineage commitment responsive to a broad range of TCR stimuli, particularly to suboptimal ones. CNS3-dependent expansion of the TCR repertoire enables T-reg cells to control self-reactive T cells effectively, especially when thymic negative selection is genetically impaired. Our findings highlight the complementary roles of these two main mechanisms of self-tolerance.","[Feng, Yongqiang; van der Veeken, Joris; Dikiy, Stanislav; Hoyos, Beatrice E.; Moltedo, Bruno; Hemmers, Saskia; Rudensky, Alexander Y.] Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Howard Hughes Med Inst, New York, NY 10065 USA; [Feng, Yongqiang; van der Veeken, Joris; Dikiy, Stanislav; Hoyos, Beatrice E.; Moltedo, Bruno; Hemmers, Saskia; Rudensky, Alexander Y.] Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Program Immunol, Ludwig Ctr, New York, NY 10065 USA; [Shugay, Mikhail; Putintseva, Ekaterina V.; Chudakov, Dmitriy M.] Shemyakin Ovchinnikov Inst Bioorgan Chem RAS, Moscow 117997, Russia; [Shugay, Mikhail; Chudakov, Dmitriy M.] Pirogov Russian Natl Res Med Univ, Moscow 117997, Russia; [Shugay, Mikhail; Putintseva, Ekaterina V.; Chudakov, Dmitriy M.] Masaryk Univ, Cent European Inst Technol, Brno 62500, Czech Republic; [Osmanbeyoglu, Hatice U.; Leslie, Christina S.] Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Computat Biol Program, New York, NY 10065 USA; [Treuting, Piper] Univ Washington, Sch Med, Dept Comparat Med, Seattle, WA 98195 USA","Rudensky, AY (reprint author), Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Howard Hughes Med Inst, New York, NY 10065 USA.",rudenska@mskcc.org,"; Chudakov, Dmitriy/G-7741-2014; Shugay, Mikhail/O-1073-2016","Dikiy, Stanislav/0000-0002-8287-6561; Chudakov, Dmitriy/0000-0003-0430-790X; Putintseva, Ekaterina/0000-0003-4421-3844; Shugay, Mikhail/0000-0001-7826-7942; Feng, Yongqiang/0000-0002-2320-5063","Cancer Research Institute; NIH [R37 AI034206, U01 HG007893]; Cancer Center Support Grant [P30 CA008748]; Howard Hughes Medical Institute; MCB program RAS; RFBR [14-04-01247, 15-34-21052]","We thank P.

Here we show, using comparative adipo-immune profiling in mice, that fat-resident regulatory T cells, termed fT(reg) cells, accumulate in adipose tissue as a function of age, but not obesity. Supporting the existence of two distinct mechanisms underlying IR, mice deficient in fT(reg) cells are protected against age-associated IR, yet remain susceptible to obesity-associated IR and metabolic disease. By contrast, selective depletion of fT(reg) cells via anti-ST2 antibody treatment increases adipose tissue insulin sensitivity. These findings establish that distinct immune cell populations within adipose tissue underlie ageing- and obesity-associated IR, and implicate fT(reg) cells as adipo-immune drivers and potential therapeutic targets in the treatment of age-associated IR.","[Bapat, Sagar P.; Zhang, Yang; Cheng, Albert; Zhou, Carmen; Liang, Yuqiong; Zheng, Ye] Salk Inst Biol Studies, Immunobiol & Microbial Pathogenesis Lab, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; [Bapat, Sagar P.; Suh, Jae Myoung; Fang, Sungsoon; Liu, Sihao; LeBlanc, Mathias; Atkins, Annette R.; Yu, Ruth T.; Downes, Michael; Evans, Ronald M.] Salk Inst Biol Studies, Gene Express Lab, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; [Suh, Jae Myoung] Korea Adv Inst Sci & Technol, Grad Sch Med Sci & Engn, Daejeon 34141, South Korea; [Fang, Sungsoon] Sejong Univ, Dept Biotechnol, Coll Life Sci, Seoul 143747, South Korea; [Liddle, Christopher] Univ Sydney, Sydney Med Sch, Westmead Millennium Inst, Storr Liver Ctr, Sydney, NSW 2145, Australia; [Evans, Ronald M.] Salk Inst Biol Studies, Howard Hughes Med Inst, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA","Evans, RM (reprint author), Salk Inst Biol Studies, Gene Express Lab, 10010 N Torrey Pines Rd, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA.",evans@salk.edu; yzheng@salk.edu,"Suh, Jae Myoung/B-3268-2015",,"National Institutes of Health (NIH) [F30 DK096828, T32 GM007198]; National Health and Medical Research Council of Australia [512354, 632886, 1043199]; NIH [DK057978, DK090962, HL088093, HL105278, ES010337]; Glenn Foundation for Medical Research; Leona M. and Harry B.

Conventional DNase sequencing (DNase-seq) for genome-wide DHSs profiling is limited by the requirement of millions of cells(4,5). Here we report an ultrasensitive strategy, called single-cell DNase sequencing (scDNase-seq) for detection of genome-wide DHSs in single cells. We show that DHS patterns at the single-cell level are highly reproducible among individual cells. Among different single cells, highly expressed gene promoters and enhancers associated with multiple active histone modifications display constitutive DHS whereas chromatin regions with fewer histone modifications exhibit high variation of DHS. Furthermore, the single-cell DHSs predict enhancers that regulate cell-specific gene expression programs and the cell-to-cell variations of DHS are predictive of gene expression. Finally, we apply scDNase-seq to pools of tumour cells and pools of normal cells, dissected from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue slides from patients with thyroid cancer, and detect thousands of tumour-specific DHSs. Many of these DHSs are associated with promoters and enhancers critically involved in cancer development. Analysis of the DHS sequences uncovers one mutation (chr18: 52417839G> C) in the tumour cells of a patient with follicular thyroid carcinoma, which affects the binding of the tumour suppressor protein p53 and correlates with decreased expression of its target gene TXNL1. In conclusion, scDNase-seq can reliably detect DHSs in single cells, greatly extending the range of applications of DHS analysis both for basic and for translational research, and may provide critical information for personalized medicine.","[Jin, Wenfei; Tang, Qingsong; Cui, Kairong; Zhang, Yi; Ren, Gang; Zhao, Keji] NHLBI, Syst Biol Ctr, Div Intramural Res, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Wan, Mimi; Sklar, Jeffrey] Yale Univ, Dept Pathol, Sch Med, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Zhang, Yi; Ni, Bing] Peoples Liberat Army, Mil Med Univ 3, Inst Immunol, Chongqing 400038, Peoples R China; [Ren, Gang] Northwest A&F Univ, Coll Anim Sci & Technol, Yangling 712100, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Przytycka, Teresa M.] Natl Lib Med, Computat Biol Branch, Natl Ctr Biotechnol Informat, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Childs, Richard] NHLBI, Hematol Branch, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Levens, David] NCI, Pathol Lab, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA","Zhao, KJ (reprint author), NHLBI, Syst Biol Ctr, Div Intramural Res, NIH, Bldg 10, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA.",zhaok@nhlbi.nih.gov,"Levens, David/C-9216-2009","Levens, David/0000-0002-7616-922X; Przytycka, Teresa/0000-0002-6261-277X; Ni, Bing/0000-0002-4297-5346","Division of Intramural Research, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute; Intramural Research Program of National Library of Medicine; Center for Cancer Research of the National Cancer Institute of the National Institutes of Health","We thank J.

Enhancer activation usually requires combinations of several TFs(1), indicating that TFs function synergistically and combinatorially(2,3). However, while TF binding has been extensively studied, little is known about how combinations of TFs and cofactors control enhancer function once they are bound. It is typically unclear which TFs participate in combinatorial enhancer activation, whether different TFs form functionally distinct groups, or if certain TFs might substitute for each other in defined enhancer contexts. Here we assess the potential regulatory contributions of TFs and cofactors to combinatorial enhancer control with enhancer complementation assays. We recruited GAL4-DNA-binding-domain fusions of 812 Drosophila TFs and cofactors to 24 enhancer contexts and measured enhancer activities by 82,752 luciferase assays in S2 cells. Most factors were functional in at least one context, yet their contributions differed between contexts and varied from repression to activation (up to 289-fold) for individual factors. Based on functional similarities across contexts, we define 15 groups of TFs that differ in developmental functions and protein sequence features. Similar TFs can substitute for each other, enabling enhancer re-engineering by exchanging TF motifs, and TF-cofactor pairs cooperate during enhancer control and interact physically. Overall, we show that activators and repressors can have diverse regulatory functions that typically depend on the enhancer context. The systematic functional characterization of TFs and cofactors should further our understanding of combinatorial enhancer control and gene regulation.","[Stampfel, Gerald; Kazmar, Tomas; Frank, Olga; Wienerroither, Sebastian; Reiter, Franziska; Stark, Alexander] Vienna Bioctr VBC, Res Inst Mol Pathol IMP, A-1030 Vienna, Austria","Stark, A (reprint author), Vienna Bioctr VBC, Res Inst Mol Pathol IMP, Dr Bohr Gasse 7, A-1030 Vienna, Austria.",stark@starklab.org,"Stark, Alexander/D-1473-2012","Stark, Alexander/0000-0003-2611-0841",European Research Council (ERC) [242922]; Boehringer Ingelheim GmbH; Austrian Research Promotion Agency (FFG),"We are grateful to K.

Improved diagnostic technology may play an increasingly crucial part in global efforts to end tuberculosis, but the ability of diagnostic tests to curb tuberculosis transmission is dependent on multiple factors, including the time taken by a patient to seek health care, the patient's symptoms, and the patterns of transmission before diagnosis. Novel diagnostic assays for tuberculosis have conventionally been evaluated on the basis of characteristics such as sensitivity and specificity, using assumptions that probably overestimate the impact of diagnostic tests on transmission. We argue for a shift in focus to the evaluation of such tests' incremental value, defining outcomes that reflect each test's purpose (for example, transmissions averted) and comparing systems with the test against those without, in terms of those outcomes. Incremental value can also be measured in units of outcome per incremental unit of resource (for example, money or human capacity). Using a novel, simplified model of tuberculosis transmission that addresses some of the limitations of earlier tuberculosis diagnostic models, we demonstrate that the incremental value of any novel test depends not just on its accuracy, but also on elements such as patient behaviour, tuberculosis natural history and health systems. By integrating these factors into a single unified framework, we advance an approach to the evaluation of new diagnostic tests for tuberculosis that considers the incremental value at the population level and demonstrates how additional data could inform more-effective implementation of tuberculosis diagnostic tests under various conditions.","[Arinaminpathy, Nimalan] Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Fac Med, Dept Infect Dis Epidemiol, MRC Ctr Outbreak Anal & Modelling, London W2 1PG, England; [Dowdy, David] Johns Hopkins Bloomberg Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Epidemiol, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA","Dowdy, D (reprint author), Johns Hopkins Bloomberg Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Epidemiol, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA.",ddowdy1@jhmi.edu,,,B.

Recent research has shown that hypoxia and malnutrition are strong predictors of mortality in children hospitalized for pneumonia. It is estimated that 15% of children under 5 who are hospitalized for pneumonia have hypoxaemia and that around 1.5 million children with severe pneumonia require oxygen treatment each year. We developed a deterministic compartmental model that links the care pathway to disease progression to assess the impact of introducing pulse oximetry as a prognostic tool to distinguish severe from non-severe pneumonia in under-5 year olds across 15 countries with the highest burden worldwide. We estimate that, assuming access to supplemental oxygen, pulse oximetry has the potential to avert up to 148,000 deaths if implemented across the 15 countries. By contrast, integrated management of childhood illness alone has a relatively small impact on mortality owing to its low sensitivity. Pulse oximetry can significantly increase the incidence of correctly treated severe cases as well as reduce the incidence of incorrect treatment with antibiotics. We also found that the combination of pulse oximetry with integrated management of childhood illness is highly cost-effective, with median estimates ranging from US$2.97 to $52.92 per disability-adjusted life year averted in the 15 countries analysed. This combination of substantial burden reduction and favourable cost-effectiveness makes pulse oximetry a promising candidate for improving the prognosis for children with pneumonia in resource-poor settings.","[Floyd, Jessica; Wu, Lindsey; Ghani, Azra C.] Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Fac Med, MRC Ctr Outbreak Anal & Modelling, Dept Infect Dis Epidemiol, London W2 1PG, England; [Wu, Lindsey] Univ London London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, Fac Infect & Trop Dis, Dept Immunol & Infect, London WC1E 7HT, England; [Burgess, Deborah Hay; Izadnegahdar, Rasa; Mukanga, David] Bill & Melinda Gates Fdn, Seattle, WA 98109 USA","Floyd, J (reprint author), Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Fac Med, MRC Ctr Outbreak Anal & Modelling, Dept Infect Dis Epidemiol, Norfolk Pl, London W2 1PG, England.",jrf1g15@soton.ac.uk; a.ghani@imperial.ac.uk,"Floyd, Jessica/A-8356-2016; Ghani, Azra/B-8560-2009","Floyd, Jessica/0000-0003-2022-0791; ",Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation Diagnostics Modelling Consortium; UK Medical Research Council (MRC); Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation; UK MRC; UK Department for International Development,"This study was funded by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation Diagnostics Modelling Consortium.

We address the role of timing of use and accuracy of diagnostics in kala-azar control and elimination. We use empirical data on health-seeking behaviour and health-system performance from the Indian state of Bihar, Bangladesh and Nepal to parameterize a mathematical model. Diagnosis of cases is key to case management, control and surveillance. Treatment of cases prevents onward transmission, and we show that the differences in time to diagnosis in these three settings explain the observed differences in incidence. Shortening the time from health-care seeking to diagnosis is likely to lead to dramatic reductions in incidence in Bihar, bringing the incidence down to the levels seen in Bangladesh and Nepal. The results emphasize the importance of maintaining population and health-system awareness, particularly as transmission and disease incidence decline. We explore the possibility of diagnosing patients before the onset of clinical kala-azar (before 14 days fever), and show that this could have a marked impact on incidence, even for a moderately sensitive test. However, limited specificity (that results in false positives) is a major barrier to such a strategy. Diagnostic tests of high specificity used at an early stage of active infection, even if sensitivity is only moderate, could have a key role in the control of kala-azar, and prevent its resurgence when paired with the passive health-care system and tests of high sensitivity, such as the test for rK39 antibody response.","[Medley, Graham F.] Univ London London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, Global Hlth & Dev, London WC1E 7HT, England; [Hollingsworth, T.

Case diagnoses during the epidemic have relied on polymerase chain reaction-based tests. Owing to limited laboratory capacity and local transport infrastructure, the delays from sample collection to test results being available have often been 2 days or more. Point-of-care rapid diagnostic tests offer the potential to substantially reduce these delays. We review Ebola rapid diagnostic tests approved by the World Health Organization and those currently in development. Such rapid diagnostic tests could allow early triaging of patients, thereby reducing the potential for nosocomial transmission. In addition, despite the lower test accuracy, rapid diagnostic test-based diagnosis may be beneficial in some contexts because of the reduced time spent by uninfected individuals in health-care settings where they may be at increased risk of infection; this also frees up hospital beds. We use mathematical modelling to explore the potential benefits of diagnostic testing strategies involving rapid diagnostic tests alone and in combination with polymerase chain reaction testing. Our analysis indicates that the use of rapid diagnostic tests with sensitivity and specificity comparable with those currently under development always enhances control, whether evaluated at a health-care-unit or population level. If such tests had been available throughout the recent epidemic, we estimate, for Sierra Leone, that their use in combination with confirmatory polymerase chain-reaction testing might have reduced the scale of the epidemic by over a third.","[Nouvellet, Pierre; Garske, Tini; Mills, Harriet L.; Nedjati-Gilani, Gemma; Hinsley, Wes; Blake, Isobel M.; Van Kerkhove, Maria D.; Cori, Anne; Dorigatti, Ilaria; Jombart, Thibaut; Riley, Steven; Fraser, Christophe; Donnelly, Christl A.; Ferguson, Neil M.] Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Fac Med, Dept Infect Dis Epidemiol, MRC Ctr Outbreak Anal & Modelling, London W2 1PG, England; [Van Kerkhove, Maria D.] Inst Pasteur, Ctr Global Hlth, F-75724 Paris 15, France","Ferguson, NM (reprint author), Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Fac Med, Dept Infect Dis Epidemiol, MRC Ctr Outbreak Anal & Modelling, Norfolk Pl, London W2 1PG, England.",neil.ferguson@imperial.ac.uk,"Ferguson, Neil/B-8578-2008; Fraser, Christophe/A-8109-2008","Ferguson, Neil/0000-0002-1154-8093; Fraser, Christophe/0000-0003-2399-9657; Dorigatti, Ilaria/0000-0001-9959-0706",Medical Research Council; Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation; MIDAS network of the National Institute of General Medical Sciences (National Institutes of Health); Health Protection Research Units of the National Institute for Health Research; European Union [278433-PREDEMICS]; Wellcome Trust,"We thank J.-C.

Patients typically attend clinics every 1 to 3 months for clinical assessment. The clinic costs are comparable with the costs of the drugs themselves and CD4 counts are measured every 6 months, but patients are rarely switched to second-line therapies. To ensure sustainability of treatment programmes, a transition to more cost-effective delivery of antiretroviral therapy is needed. In contrast to the CD4 count, measurement of the level of HIV RNA in plasma (the viral load) provides a direct measure of the current treatment effect. Viral-load-informed differentiated care is a means of tailoring care so that those with suppressed viral load visit the clinic less frequently and attention is focussed on those with unsuppressed viral load to promote adherence and timely switching to a second-line regimen. The most feasible approach to measuring viral load in many countries is to collect dried blood spot samples for testing in regional laboratories; however, there have been concerns over the sensitivity and specificity of this approach to define treatment failure and the delay in returning results to the clinic. We use modelling to synthesize evidence and evaluate the cost-effectiveness of viral-load-informed differentiated care, accounting for limitations of dried blood sample testing. We find that viral-load-informed differentiated care using dried blood sample testing is cost-effective and is a recommended strategy for patient monitoring, although further empirical evidence as the approach is rolled out would be of value. We also explore the potential benefits of point-of-care viral load tests that may become available in the future.","[Phillips, Andrew; Cambiano, Valentina; Nakagawa, Fumiyo; Bansi-Matharu, Loveleen] UCL, Dept Infect & Populat Hlth, London NW3 2PF, England; [Shroufi, Amir; Ellman, Tom; Maman, David] Medecinssans Frontieres MSF SA, SAMU, ZA-7700 Cape Town, South Africa; [Vojnov, Lara; Katz, Zachary; Wareham, Meghan] Clinton Hlth Access Initiat, Boston, MA 02127 USA; [Cohn, Jennifer; Roberts, Teri] Med Sans Frontieres, Access Campaign, CH-1202 Geneva, Switzerland; [Bonner, Kimberly] Med Sans Frontieres, CH-1211 Geneva 21, Switzerland; [Rousseau, Christine; Garnett, Geoff] Bill & Melinda Gates Fdn, Seattle, WA 98199 USA; [Ford, Deborah] UCL, Inst Clin Trials & Methodol, MRC Clin Trials Unit, London WC2B 6NH, England; [Miners, Alec] London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, Hlth Serv Res & Policy, London WC1H 9SY, England; [Lundgren, Jens D.] Univ Copenhagen, Rigshosp, Dept Infect Dis, CHIP, DK-92100 Copenhagen, Denmark; [Eaton, Jeffrey W.; Hallett, Timothy B.] Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Dept Infect Dis Epidemiol, London W2 1PG, England; [Parkes-Ratanshi, Rosalind] Makerere Univ, Coll Hlth Sci, IDI, Kampala, Uganda; [Ford, Nathan; Vitoria, Marco; Doherty, Meg] WHO, HIV AIDS & Global Hepatitis Programme, CH-1211 Geneva, Switzerland; [Dowdy, David] Johns Hopkins Bloomberg Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Epidemiol, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA; [Nichols, Brooke; van de Vijver, David] Erasmus MC, Dept Virosci, NL-3000 CA Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Murtagh, Maurine] Univ London London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, Int Diagnost Ctr, London WC1E 7HT, England; [Palamountain, Kara M.] Northwestern Univ, Kellogg Sch Management, Evanston, IL 60208 USA; [Musanhu, Christine Chakanyuka] WHO Country Off, Harare, Zimbabwe; [Stevens, Wendy] Univ Witwatersrand, Dept Mol Med & Haematol, ZA-2050 Johannesburg, South Africa; [Katzenstein, David] Stanford Univ, Med Ctr, Div Infect Dis, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Ciaranello, Andrea] Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Div Infect Dis, Boston, MA 02114 USA; [Barnabas, Ruanne] Univ Washington, Med Global Hlth & Epidemiol, Seattle, WA 98104 USA; [Braithwaite, R.

However, the effectiveness of such strategies will depend on the extent to which current and future diagnostics are able to detect those individuals who are infectious to mosquitoes. We estimate the relationship between parasite density and onward infectivity using sensitive quantitative parasite diagnostics and mosquito feeding assays from Burkina Faso. We find that a diagnostic with a lower detection limit of 200 parasites per microlitre would detect 55% of the infectious reservoir (the combined infectivity to mosquitoes of the whole population weighted by how often each individual is bitten) whereas a test with a limit of 20 parasites per microlitre would detect 83% and 2 parasites per microlitre would detect 95% of the infectious reservoir. Using mathematical models, we show that increasing the diagnostic sensitivity from 200 parasites per microlitre (equivalent to microscopy or current rapid diagnostic tests) to 2 parasites per microlitre would increase the number of regions where transmission could be interrupted with a mass-screen-and-treat programme from an entomological inoculation rate below 1 to one of up to 4. The higher sensitivity diagnostic could reduce the number of treatment rounds required to interrupt transmission in areas of lower prevalence. We predict that mass-screen-and-treat with a highly sensitive diagnostic is less effective than mass drug administration owing to the prophylactic protection provided to uninfected individuals by the latter approach. In low-transmission settings such as those in Southeast Asia, we find that a diagnostic tool with a sensitivity of 20 parasites per microlitre may be sufficient for targeted mass drug administration because this diagnostic is predicted to identify a similar village population prevalence compared with that currently detected using polymerase chain reaction if treatment levels are high and screening is conducted during the dry season. Along with other factors, such as coverage, choice of drug, timing of the intervention, importation of infections, and seasonality, the sensitivity of the diagnostic can play a part in increasing the chance of interrupting transmission.","[Slater, Hannah C.; Walker, Patrick G.

Future efforts to reduce malaria further will require moving beyond the treatment of clinical infections to targeting malaria transmission more broadly in the community. As such, the accurate identification of asymptomatic human infections, which can sustain a large proportion of transmission, is becoming a vital component of control and elimination programmes. We determined the relationship across common diagnostics used to measure malaria prevalence - polymerase chain reaction (PCR), rapid diagnostic test and microscopy - for the detection of Plasmodium falciparum infections in endemic populations based on a pooled analysis of cross-sectional data. We included data from more than 170,000 individuals comparing the detection by rapid diagnostic test and microscopy, and 30,000 for detection by rapid diagnostic test and PCR. The analysis showed that, on average, rapid diagnostic tests detected 41% (95% confidence interval = 26-66%) of PCR-positive infections. Data for the comparison of rapid diagnostic test to PCR detection at high transmission intensity and in adults were sparse. Prevalence measured by rapid diagnostic test and microscopy was comparable, although rapid diagnostic test detected slightly more infections than microscopy. On average, microscopy captured 87% (95% confidence interval = 74-102%) of rapid diagnostic test-positive infections. The extent to which higher rapid diagnostic test detection reflects increased sensitivity, lack of specificity or both, is unclear. Once the contribution of asymptomatic individuals to the infectious reservoir is better defined, future analyses should ideally establish optimal detection limits of new diagnostics for use in control and elimination strategies.","[Wu, Lindsey; van den Hoogen, Lotus L.; Drakeley, Chris J.] Univ London London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, Fac Infect & Trop Dis, Dept Immunol & Infect, London WC1E 7HT, England; [Slater, Hannah; Walker, Patrick G.

Together, these three phyla comprise the deuterostomes. Here we report the draft genome sequences of two acorn worms, Saccoglossus kowalevskii and Ptychodera flava. By comparing them with diverse bilaterian genomes, we identify shared traits that were probably inherited from the last common deuterostome ancestor, and then explore evolutionary trajectories leading from this ancestor to hemichordates, echinoderms and chordates. The hemichordate genomes exhibit extensive conserved synteny with amphioxus and other bilaterians, and deeply conserved non-coding sequences that are candidates for conserved gene-regulatory elements. Notably, hemichordates possess a deuterostome-specific genomic cluster of four ordered transcription factor genes, the expression of which is associated with the development of pharyngeal 'gill' slits, the foremost morphological innovation of early deuterostomes, and is probably central to their filter-feeding lifestyle. Comparative analysis reveals numerous deuterostome-specific gene novelties, including genes found in deuterostomes and marine microbes, but not other animals. The putative functions of these genes can be linked to physiological, metabolic and developmental specializations of the filter-feeding ancestor.","[Simakov, Oleg; Rokhsar, Daniel S.] Grad Univ, Okinawa Inst Sci & Technol, Mol Genet Unit, Onna, Okinawa 9040495, Japan; [Simakov, Oleg] Heidelberg Univ, Dept Mol Evolut, Ctr Organismal Studies, D-69115 Heidelberg, Germany; [Kawashima, Takeshi; Hisata, Kanako; Shoguchi, Eiichi; Gyoja, Fuki; Baughman, Kenneth W.; Satoh, Noriyuki] Grad Univ, Okinawa Inst Sci & Technol, Marine Genom Unit, Onna, Okinawa 9040495, Japan; [Marletaz, Ferdinand] Univ Oxford, Dept Zool, Oxford OX1 3PS, England; [Jenkins, Jerry; Schmutz, Jeremy] HudsonAlpha Inst Biotechnol, Huntsville, AL 35806 USA; [Koyanagi, Ryo; Fujie, Manabu; Goto, Hiroki; Kanda, Miyuki; Arakaki, Nana; Yamasaki, Shinichi] Grad Univ, Okinawa Inst Sci & Technol, DNA Sequencing Sect, Onna, Okinawa 9040495, Japan; [Mitros, Therese; Bredeson, Jessen; Wu, Michael; Rokhsar, Daniel S.; Gerhart, John] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mol & Cell Biol, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Yue, Jia-Xing; Putnam, Nicholas H.] Rice Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Houston, TX 77005 USA; [Chen, Yi-Chih; Su, Yi-Hsien; Yu, Jr-Kai] Acad Sinica, Inst Cellular & Organism Biol, Taipei 11529, Taiwan; [Freeman, Robert M., Jr.; Peshkin, Leonid; Kirschner, Marc W.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Syst Biol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Sasaki, Akane; Tagawa, Kunifumi] Hiroshima Univ, Grad Sch Sci, Marine Biol Lab, Onomichi, Hiroshima 7220073, Japan; [Hikosaka-Katayama, Tomoe] Hiroshima Univ, Gene Sci Div, Nat Sci Ctr Basic Res & Dev, Hiroshima 7398527, Japan; [Sato, Atsuko] Marine Biol Assoc UK, Lab, Plymouth PL1 2PB, Devon, England; [Levine, Judith; Gonzalez, Paul; Fritzenwanker, Jens H.; Lowe, Christopher J.] Stanford Univ, Dept Biol, Hopkins Marine Stn, Pacific Grove, CA 93950 USA; [Cameron, Christopher] Univ Montreal, Dept Sci Biol, Montreal, PQ H3C 3J7, Canada; [Pani, Ariel M.] Univ N Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA; [Qu, Jiaxin; Cree, Andrew; Ding, Yan; Dinh, Huyen H.; Dugan, Shannon; Holder, Michael; Jhangiani, Shalini N.; Kovar, Christie L.; Lee, Sandra L.; Lewis, Lora R.; Morton, Donna; Nazareth, Lynne V.; Okwuonu, Geoffrey; Santibanez, Jireh; Chen, Rui; Richards, Stephen; Muzny, Donna M.; Worley, Kim C.; Gibbs, Richard A.] Baylor Coll Med, Dept Mol & Human Genet, Human Genome Sequencing Ctr, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Gillis, Andrew] Univ Cambridge, Dept Zool, Cambridge CB2 3EJ, England; [Humphreys, Tom] Univ Hawaii, Inst Biogenesis Res, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; [Fujiyama, Asao] Natl Inst Genet, Mishima, Shizuoka 4113540, Japan; [Rokhsar, Daniel S.] US DOE, Joint Genome Inst, Walnut Creek, CA 94598 USA","Simakov, O (reprint author), Grad Univ, Okinawa Inst Sci & Technol, Mol Genet Unit, Onna, Okinawa 9040495, Japan.",oleg.simakov@oist.jp; norisky@oist.jp; dsrokhsar@gmail.com; jgerhart@berkeley.edu,"Su, Yi-Hsien/F-2910-2014; Schmutz, Jeremy/N-3173-2013; Simakov, Oleg/G-4572-2015","Schmutz, Jeremy/0000-0001-8062-9172; Simakov, Oleg/0000-0002-3585-4511; Putnam, Nicholas/0000-0002-1315-782X; Yue, Jia-Xing/0000-0002-2122-9221; Rokhsar, Daniel/0000-0002-8704-2224; Marletaz, Ferdinand/0000-0001-8124-4266","MEXT; OIST, Japan; USPHS [HD42724, HD37277]; NASA [FDNAG2-1605, NNX13AI68G]; FP7/ERC grant [268513]; Molecular Genetics Unit of the Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology Graduate University; Marine Genomics Unit of the Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology Graduate University; Academia Sinica; Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan; NIH [R01HD073104]; National Human Genome Research Institute, National Institutes of Health [U54 HG003273]","The Ptychodera flava genome project was supported by MEXT and OIST, Japan.

However, the cellular nature of the EMH niche is unknown. Here we assessed the sources of the key niche factors, SCF (also known as KITL) and CXCL12, in the mouse spleen after EMH induction by myeloablation, blood loss, or pregnancy. In each case, Scf was expressed by endothelial cells and Tcf21(+) stromal cells, primarily around sinusoids in the red pulp, while Cxcl12 was expressed by a subset of Tcf21(+) stromal cells. EMH induction markedly expanded the Scf-expressing endothelial cells and stromal cells by inducing proliferation. Most splenic HSCs were adjacent to Tcf21(+) stromal cells in red pulp. Conditional deletion of Scf from spleen endothelial cells, or of Scf or Cxcl12 from Tcf21(+) stromal cells, severely reduced spleen EMH and reduced blood cell counts without affecting bone marrow haematopoiesis. Endothelial cells and Tcf21(+) stromal cells thus create a perisinusoidal EMH niche in the spleen, which is necessary for the physiological response to diverse haematopoietic stresses.","[Inra, Christopher N.; Zhou, Bo O.; Acar, Melih; Murphy, Malea M.; Zhao, Zhiyu; Morrison, Sean J.] Univ Texas SW Med Ctr Dallas, Dept Pediat, Dallas, TX 75390 USA; [Inra, Christopher N.; Zhou, Bo O.; Acar, Melih; Murphy, Malea M.; Zhao, Zhiyu; Morrison, Sean J.] Univ Texas SW Med Ctr Dallas, Childrens Res Inst, Dallas, TX 75390 USA; [Richardson, James] Univ Texas SW Med Ctr Dallas, Dept Pathol, Dallas, TX 75390 USA; [Morrison, Sean J.] Univ Texas SW Med Ctr Dallas, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Dallas, TX 75390 USA","Morrison, SJ (reprint author), Univ Texas SW Med Ctr Dallas, Dept Pediat, Dallas, TX 75390 USA.",sean.morrison@utsouthwestern.edu,,"Morrison, Sean/0000-0003-1587-8329","Leukemia and Lymphoma Society; National Institutes of Health National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute [HL097760]","S.J.M. is a Howard Hughes Medical Institute Investigator, the Mary McDermott Cook Chair in Pediatric Genetics, the director of the Hamon Laboratory for Stem Cells and Cancer, and a Cancer Prevention and Research Institute of Texas Scholar.

Here we establish an EMT lineage-tracing system to monitor this process in mice, using a mesenchymal-specific Cre-mediated fluorescent marker switch system in spontaneous breast-to-lung metastasis models. We show that within a predominantly epithelial primary tumour, a small proportion of tumour cells undergo EMT. Notably, lung metastases mainly consist of non-EMT tumour cells that maintain their epithelial phenotype. Inhibiting EMT by overexpressing the microRNA miR-200 does not affect lung metastasis development. However, EMT cells significantly contribute to recurrent lung metastasis formation after chemotherapy. These cells survived cyclophosphamide treatment owing to reduced proliferation, apoptotic tolerance and increased expression of chemoresistance-related genes. Overexpression of miR-200 abrogated this resistance. This study suggests the potential of an EMT-targeting strategy, in conjunction with conventional chemotherapies, for breast cancer treatment.","[Fischer, Karl R.; Durrans, Anna; Lee, Sharrell; Choi, Hyejin; El Rayes, Tina; Ryu, Scongho; Atorki, Nasser K.; Mittal, Vivek; Gao, Dingeheng] Cornell Univ, Weill Cornell Med Coll, Dept Cardiothorac Surg, New York, NY 10065 USA; [Fischer, Karl R.; Durrans, Anna; Lee, Sharrell; Choi, Hyejin; El Rayes, Tina; Mittal, Vivek; Gao, Dingeheng] Cornell Univ, Weill Cornell Med Coll, Dept Cell & Dev Biol, New York, NY 10065 USA; [Fischer, Karl R.; Durrans, Anna; Lee, Sharrell; Choi, Hyejin; El Rayes, Tina; Ryu, Scongho; Atorki, Nasser K.; Mittal, Vivek; Gao, Dingeheng] Cornell Univ, Weill Cornell Med Coll, Neuberger Berman Lung Canc Ctr, New York, NY 10065 USA; [Fischer, Karl R.; Choi, Hyejin; El Rayes, Tina] Cornell Univ, Weill Cornell Med Coll, Weill Cornell Grad Sch Med Sci, New York, NY 10065 USA; [Sheng, Jianting; Li, Fuhai; Wong, Stephen T.

Among these is GPR68, a proton receptor that lacks small molecule modulators for probing its biology. Using yeast-based screens against GPR68, here we identify the benzodiazepine drug lorazepam as a non-selective GPR68 positive allosteric modulator. More than 3,000 GPR68 homology models were refined to recognize lorazepam in a putative allosteric site. Docking 3.1 million molecules predicted new GPR68 modulators, many of which were confirmed in functional assays. One potent GPR68 modulator, ogerin, suppressed recall in fear conditioning in wild-type but not in GPR68-knockout mice. The same approach led to the discovery of allosteric agonists and negative allosteric modulators for GPR65. Combining physical and structure-based screening may be broadly useful for ligand discovery for understudied and orphan GPCRs.","[Huang, Xi-Ping; Kroeze, Wesley K.; Zhu, Hu; Farrell, Martilias S.; Wang, Sheng; Mangano, Thomas J.; Jiang, Alice; Kenakin, Terry; Roth, Bryan L.] Univ N Carolina, Dept Pharmacol, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA; [Huang, Xi-Ping; Mangano, Thomas J.; Jiang, Alice; Roth, Bryan L.] Univ N Carolina, Sch Med, Natl Inst Mental Hlth, Psychoact Drug Screening Program, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA; [Karpiak, Joel; Shoichet, Brian K.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Pharmaceut Chem, San Francisco, CA 94158 USA; [Chen, Xin; Jin, Jian] Univ N Carolina, Ctr Integrat Chem Biol & Drug Discovery CICBDD, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA; [Chen, Xin; Jin, Jian; Roth, Bryan L.] Univ N Carolina, Eshelman Sch Pharm, Div Chem Biol & Med Chem, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA; [Moy, Sheryl S.; Saddoris, Kara A.; Nikolova, Viktoriya D.] Univ N Carolina, Dept Psychiat, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA; [Moy, Sheryl S.; Saddoris, Kara A.; Nikolova, Viktoriya D.] Univ N Carolina, Carolina Inst Dev Disabil CIDD, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA; [Deshpande, Deepak A.; Penn, Raymond B.] Thomas Jefferson Univ, Ctr Translat Med, Philadelphia, PA 19107 USA; [Deshpande, Deepak A.; Penn, Raymond B.] Thomas Jefferson Univ, Dept Med, Philadelphia, PA 19107 USA; [Koller, Beverly H.] Univ N Carolina, Sch Med, Dept Genet, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA","Roth, BL (reprint author), Univ N Carolina, Dept Pharmacol, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA.",bshoichet@gmail.com; bryan_roth@med.unc.edu,,,"National Institutes of Health (NIH) [U01104974, R01 DA017204]; National Institute of Mental Health Psychoactive Drug Screening Program (NIMH PDSP); Michael Hooker Chair for Protein Therapeutics and Translational Proteomics; Genentech Foundation Predoctoral Fellowship; NIH [GM59957, GM71896, U19MH082441]; Structural Genomics Consortium; NICHD [U54 HD079124];  [P01 HL114471]","This work was supported by National Institutes of Health (NIH) grants U01104974 (B.L.R., B.K.S. and W.K.K.), R01 DA017204 (B.L.R. and W.K.K.) and the National Institute of Mental Health Psychoactive Drug Screening Program (NIMH PDSP) (X.-P.H., H.Z., M.S.F., W.K.K., T.J.M., A.J. and B.L.R.), the Michael Hooker Chair for Protein Therapeutics and Translational Proteomics to B.L.R.; Genentech Foundation Predoctoral Fellowship (J.K.); NIH grants GM59957 and GM71896 (B.K.S.) and the Structural Genomics Consortium (B.K.S.); grant P01 HL114471 (R.B.P. and D.A.D.); NICHD grant U54 HD079124 (M.S.M., K.A.S., V.N.); NIH grant U19MH082441 (B.L.R., J.J. and X.C.).

A true first star has not yet been discovered, although stars(2-4) with tiny amounts of elements heavier than helium ('metals') have been found in the outer regions ('halo') of the Milky Way. The first stars and their immediate successors should, however, preferentially be found today in the central regions ('bulges') of galaxies, because they formed in the largest over-densities that grew gravitationally with time(5,6). The Milky Way bulge underwent a rapid chemical enrichment during the first 1-2 billion years(7), leading to a dearth of early, metal-poor stars(8,9). Here we report observations of extremely metal-poor stars in the Milky Way bulge, including one star with an iron abundance about 10,000 times lower than the solar value without noticeable carbon enhancement. We confirm that most of the metal-poor bulge stars are on tight orbits around the Galactic Centre, rather than being halo stars passing through the bulge, as expected for stars formed at redshifts greater than 15. Their chemical compositions are in general similar to typical halo stars of the same metallicity although intriguing differences exist, including lower abundances of carbon.","[Howes, L.

They have periods of up to about 1,000 days and amplitudes that can exceed a factor of three in the I-band flux. These stars pulsate predominantly in their fundamental mode(1-3), which is a function of mass and radius, and so the pulsation periods are sensitive to the age of the underlying stellar population(4). The overall number of long-period variables in a population is directly related to their lifetimes, which is difficult to predict from first principles because of uncertainties associated with stellar mass-loss and convective mixing. The time variability of these stars has not previously been taken into account when modelling the spectral energy distributions of galaxies. Here we construct time-dependent stellar population models that include the effects of long-period variable stars, and report the ubiquitous detection of this expected 'pixel shimmer' in the massive metal-rich galaxy M87. The pixel light curves display a variety of behaviours. The observed variation of 0.1 to 1 per cent is very well matched to the predictions of our models. The data provide a strong constraint on the properties of variable stars in an old and metal-rich stellar population, and we infer that the lifetime of long-period variables in M87 is shorter by approximately 30 per cent compared to predictions from the latest stellar evolution models.","[Conroy, Charlie; Choi, Jieun] Harvard Univ, Dept Astron, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [van Dokkum, Pieter G.] Yale Univ, Dept Astron, New Haven, CT 06511 USA","Conroy, C (reprint author), Harvard Univ, Dept Astron, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",cconroy@cfa.harvard.edu,,,,,,28,3,3,0,6,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,26-Nov,2015,527,7579,,,,,488,+,,10.1038/nature15731,,11,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,CW9XW,WOS:000365352500041,26570999,No,,,11/19/17

Models of the impact process predict that the lunar material was disaggregated into a circumplanetary disk and that lunar accretion subsequently placed the Moon in a near-equatorial orbit(3-6). Forward integration of the lunar orbit from this initial state predicts a modern inclination at least an order of magnitude smaller than the lunar value-a long-standing discrepancy known as the lunar inclination problem(7-9). Here we show that the modern lunar orbit provides a sensitive record of gravitational interactions with Earth-crossing planetesimals that were not yet accreted at the time of the Moon-forming event. The currently observed lunar orbit can naturally be reproduced via interaction with a small quantity of mass (corresponding to 0.0075-0.015 Earth masses eventually accreted to the Earth) carried by a few bodies, consistent with the constraints and models of late accretion(10,11). Although the encounter process has a stochastic element, the observed value of the lunar inclination is among the most likely outcomes for a wide range of parameters. The excitation of the lunar orbit is most readily reproduced via collisionless encounters of planetesimals with the Earth-Moon system with strong dissipation of tidal energy on the early Earth. This mechanism obviates the need for previously proposed (but idealized) excitation mechanisms(12,13), places the Moon-forming event in the context of the formation of Earth, and constrains the pristineness of the dynamical state of the Earth-Moon system.","[Pahlevan, Kaveh; Morbidelli, Alessandro] Univ Cote Azur, Observ Cote Azur, Lab Lagrange, F-06304 Nice 4, France","Pahlevan, K (reprint author), Univ Cote Azur, Observ Cote Azur, Lab Lagrange, CNRS Blvd Observ CS 34229, F-06304 Nice 4, France.",pahlevan@oca.eu,,,"Henri Poincare Fellowship at the Observatoire de la Cote d'Azur (OCA); OCA; City of Nice, France; European Research Council Advanced Grant ACCRETE [290568]","This research was carried out as part of a Henri Poincare Fellowship at the Observatoire de la Cote d'Azur (OCA) to K.P.

Majorana and Weyl fermions had not been observed experimentally until the recent discovery of condensed matter systems such as topological superconductors and semimetals, in which they arise as low-energy excitations(1-6). Here we propose the existence of a previously overlooked type of Weyl fermion that emerges at the boundary between electron and hole pockets in a new phase of matter. This particle was missed by Weyl(7) because it breaks the stringent Lorentz symmetry in high-energy physics. Lorentz invariance, however, is not present in condensed matter physics, and by generalizing the Dirac equation, we find the new type of Weyl fermion. In particular, whereas Weyl semimetals-materials hosting Weyl fermions-were previously thought to have standard Weyl points with a point-like Fermi surface (which we refer to as type-I), we discover a type-II Weyl point, which is still a protected crossing, but appears at the contact of electron and hole pockets in type-II Weyl semimetals. We predict that WTe2 is an example of a topological semimetal hosting the new particle as a low-energy excitation around such a type-II Weyl point. The existence of type-II Weyl points in WTe2 means that many of its physical properties are very different to those of standard Weyl semimetals with point-like Fermi surfaces.","[Soluyanov, Alexey A.; Gresch, Dominik; Wu, QuanSheng; Troyer, Matthias] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Theoret Phys & Stn Zurich Q, CH-8093 Zurich, Switzerland; [Wang, Zhijun; Bernevig, B.

Although optical microscopy is still limited to surface imaging owing to optical wave diffusion and fast decorrelation in tissue, revolutionary approaches such as fluorescence photo-activated localization microscopy led to a striking increase in resolution by more than an order of magnitude in the last decade(1). In contrast with optics, ultrasonic waves propagate deep into organs without losing their coherence and are much less affected by in vivo decorrelation processes. However, their resolution is impeded by the fundamental limits of diffraction, which impose a long-standing trade-off between resolution and penetration. This limits clinical and preclinical ultrasound imaging to a sub-millimetre scale. Here we demonstrate in vivo that ultrasound imaging at ultrafast frame rates (more than 500 frames per second) provides an analogue to optical localization microscopy by capturing the transient signal decorrelation of contrast agents-inert gas microbubbles. Ultrafast ultrasound localization microscopy allowed both non-invasive sub-wavelength structural imaging and haemodynamic quantification of rodent cerebral microvessels (less than ten micrometres in diameter) more than ten millimetres below the tissue surface, leading to transcranial whole-brain imaging within short acquisition times (tens of seconds). After intravenous injection, single echoes from individual microbubbles were detected through ultrafast imaging. Their localization, not limited by diffraction, was accumulated over 75,000 images, yielding 1,000,000 events per coronal plane and statistically independent pixels of ten micrometres in size. Precise temporal tracking of microbubble positions allowed us to extract accurately in-plane velocities of the blood flow with a large dynamic range (from one millimetre per second to several centimetres per second). These results pave the way for deep non-invasive microscopy in animals and humans using ultrasound. We anticipate that ultrafast ultrasound localization microscopy may become an invaluable tool for the fundamental understanding and diagnostics of various disease processes that modify the microvascular blood flow, such as cancer, stroke and arteriosclerosis.","[Errico, Claudia; Pierre, Juliette; Desailly, Yann; Couture, Olivier; Tanter, Mickael] INSERM, Inst Langevin, F-75005 Paris, France; [Errico, Claudia; Pierre, Juliette; Desailly, Yann; Couture, Olivier; Tanter, Mickael] PSL Res Univ, ESPCI ParisTech, Inst Langevin, F-75005 Paris, France; [Errico, Claudia; Pierre, Juliette; Desailly, Yann; Couture, Olivier; Tanter, Mickael] CNRS, UMR 7587, F-75005 Paris, France; [Pezet, Sophie; Lenkei, Zsolt] CNRS, UMR 8249, F-75005 Paris, France; [Pezet, Sophie; Lenkei, Zsolt] PSL Res Univ, ESPCI ParisTech, Brain Plast Unit, F-75005 Paris, France","Tanter, M (reprint author), INSERM, Inst Langevin, 1 Rue Jussieu, F-75005 Paris, France.",mickael.tanter@espci.fr,"Tanter, Mickael/H-4657-2012",,"Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR), within the project ANR MUSLI; Fondation Pierre-Gilles de Gennes; LABEX WIFI (Laboratory of Excellence) within the French Program ""Investments for the Future"" [ANR-10-LABX-24, ANR-10-IDEX-0001-02 PSL*]","This work was supported principally by the Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR), within the project ANR MUSLI.

The selectivity and uptake capacity of the adsorption process are determined by interactions involving the adsorbates and their porous host materials. But, although the interactions of adsorbate molecules with the internal MOF surface(10-17) and also amongst themselves within individual pores(18-22) have been extensively studied, adsorbate-adsorbate interactions across pore walls have not been explored. Here we show that local strain in the MOF, induced by pore filling, can give rise to collective and long-range adsorbate-adsorbate interactions and the formation of adsorbate superlattices that extend beyond an original MOF unit cell. Specifically, we use in situ small-angle X-ray scattering to track and map the distribution and ordering of adsorbate molecules in five members of the mesoporous MOF-74 series along entire adsorption-desorption isotherms. We find in all cases that the capillary condensation that fills the pores gives rise to the formation of 'extra adsorption domains'-that is, domains spanning several neighbouring pores, which have a higher adsorbate density than non-domain pores. In the case of one MOF, IRMOF-74-V-hex, these domains form a superlattice structure that is difficult to reconcile with the prevailing view of pore-filling as a stochastic process. The visualization of the adsorption process provided by our data, with clear evidence for initial adsorbate aggregation in distinct domains and ordering before an even distribution is finally reached, should help to improve our understanding of this process and may thereby improve our ability to exploit it practically.","[Cho, Hae Sung; Miyasaka, Keiichi; Cho, Minhyung; Kang, Jeung Ku; Yaghi, Omar M.; Terasaki, Osamu] Korea Adv Inst Sci & Technol, Grad Sch Energy Environm Water & Sustainabil, WCU BK21Plus, Taejon 305701, South Korea; [Deng, Hexiang; Dong, Zhiyue] Wuhan Univ, Coll Chem & Mol Sci, Key Lab Biomed Polymers Minist Educ, Wuhan 430072, Peoples R China; [Deng, Hexiang] Wuhan Univ, Inst Adv Studies, Wuhan 430072, Peoples R China; [Neimark, Alexander V.] Rutgers State Univ, Dept Chem & Biochem Engn, Piscataway, NJ 08854 USA; [Yaghi, Omar M.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Chem, Div Mat Sci, Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Yaghi, Omar M.] Kavli Energy NanoSci Inst, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Yaghi, Omar M.] King Fahd Univ Petr & Minerals, Dhahran 31261, Saudi Arabia; [Terasaki, Osamu] Stockholm Univ, Berzelii Ctr EXSELENT Porous Mat, Dept Mat & Environm Chem, SE-10691 Stockholm, Sweden","Yaghi, OM (reprint author), Korea Adv Inst Sci & Technol, Grad Sch Energy Environm Water & Sustainabil, WCU BK21Plus, Taejon 305701, South Korea.",yaghi@berkeley.edu; terasaki@kaist.ac.kr,"Kang, Jeung ku/C-1610-2011; Deng, Hexiang/N-5616-2017","Deng, Hexiang/0000-0002-9398-7996; Yaghi, Omar/0000-0002-5611-3325","WCU/BK21+; HIMC of Global Frontier Project - Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning [2013M3A6B1078884]; Korea Center for Artificial Photosynthesis; Berzelii Centre EXSELENT on Porous Materials; BASF (Ludwigshafen, Germany); 1000 Talent Plan of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China [21471118]; National Key Basic Research Program of China [2014CB239203]; NSF ERC 'Structured Organic Particulate Systems'","The authors acknowledge K.

The short read lengths of early Sanger and current next-generation sequencing platforms hinder assembly through complex repeat regions, and many draft and reference genomes are fragmented, lacking skewed GC and repetitive intergenic sequences, which are gaining importance due to projects like the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE)(2). Here we report the whole-genome sequencing and assembly of the desiccation-tolerant grass Oropetium thomaeum. Using only single-molecule real-time sequencing, which generates long (>16 kilobases) reads with random errors, we assembled 99% (244 megabases) of the Oropetium genome into 625 contigs with an N50 length of 2.4 megabases. Oropetium is an example of a 'near-complete' draft genome which includes gapless coverage over gene space as well as intergenic sequences such as centromeres, telomeres, transposable elements and rRNA clusters that are typically unassembled in draft genomes. Oropetium has 28,466 protein-coding genes and 43% repeat sequences, yet with 30% more compact euchromatic regions it is the smallest known grass genome. The Oropetium genome demonstrates the utility of single-molecule real-time sequencing for assembling high-quality plant and other eukaryotic genomes, and serves as a valuable resource for the plant comparative genomics community.","[VanBuren, Robert; Bryant, Doug; Mockler, Todd C.] Donald Danforth Plant Sci Ctr, St Louis, MO 63132 USA; [Edger, Patrick P.; Burgess, Diane; Freeling, Michael] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Plant & Microbial Biol, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Edger, Patrick P.] Michigan State Univ, Dept Hort, E Lansing, MI 48323 USA; [Tang, Haibao; Lyons, Eric] Univ Arizona, Sch Plant Sci, IPlant Collaborat, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA; [Tang, Haibao] Fujian Agr & Forestry Univ, HIST, Ctr Genom & Biotechnol, Fuzhou 350002, Peoples R China; [Challabathula, Dinakar; Bartels, Dorothea] Univ Bonn, IMBIO, D-53115 Bonn, Germany; [Spittle, Kristi; Hall, Richard; Gu, Jenny] Pacific Biosci, Menlo Pk, CA 94025 USA; [Ten Hallers, Boudewijn; Hastie, Alex] BioNano Genom, San Diego, CA 92121 USA; [Michael, Todd P.] Ibis Biosci, Carlsbad, CA 92008 USA","VanBuren, R (reprint author), Donald Danforth Plant Sci Ctr, St Louis, MO 63132 USA.",toddpmichael@gmail.com; tmockler@danforthcenter.org,"Mockler, Todd/L-2609-2013","Mockler, Todd/0000-0002-0462-5775; Challabathula, Dinakar/0000-0002-7158-5902","National Science foundation [DBI-1401572, DBI-120793]; USDA NIFA [CO471A-B]; Department of Energy [DE-SC0012639, DE-SC-0008769]; Donald Danforth Plant Science Center; Enterprise Rent-A-Car Institute for Renewable Fuels","This work is supported in part by funding from the National Science foundation (DBI-1401572 to R.V.; DBI-120793 to P.P.E.), USDA NIFA (CO471A-B to M.F.), the Department of Energy (DE-SC0012639 to T.C.M. and T.P.M.; DE-SC-0008769 to T.C.M.), the Donald Danforth Plant Science Center to T.C.M. and the Enterprise Rent-A-Car Institute for Renewable Fuels to T.C.M.

Recent imaging studies have shown that sweet and bitter are represented in the primary gustatory cortex by neurons organized in a spatial map(3,4), with each taste quality encoded by distinct cortical fields(4). Here we demonstrate that by manipulating the brain fields representing sweet and bitter taste we directly control an animal's internal representation, sensory perception, and behavioural actions. These results substantiate the segregation of taste qualities in the cortex, expose the innate nature of appetitive and aversive taste responses, and illustrate the ability of gustatory cortex to recapitulate complex behaviours in the absence of sensory input.","[Peng, Yueqing; Gillis-Smith, Sarah; Jin, Hao; Traenkner, Dimitri; Zuker, Charles S.] Columbia Univ Coll Phys & Surg, Howard Hughes Med Inst, New York, NY 10032 USA; [Peng, Yueqing; Gillis-Smith, Sarah; Jin, Hao; Traenkner, Dimitri; Zuker, Charles S.] Columbia Univ Coll Phys & Surg, Dept Biochem, New York, NY 10032 USA; [Peng, Yueqing; Gillis-Smith, Sarah; Jin, Hao; Traenkner, Dimitri; Zuker, Charles S.] Columbia Univ Coll Phys & Surg, Dept Mol Biophys, New York, NY 10032 USA; [Peng, Yueqing; Gillis-Smith, Sarah; Jin, Hao; Traenkner, Dimitri; Zuker, Charles S.] Columbia Univ Coll Phys & Surg, Dept Neurosci, New York, NY 10032 USA; [Traenkner, Dimitri; Zuker, Charles S.] HHMI Janelia Farm Res Campus, Ashburn, VA 20147 USA; [Ryba, Nicholas J.

Synchronized circadian clocks improve fitness(2) and are crucial for our physical and mental well-being(3). Visual and non-visual photoreceptors are responsible for synchronizing circadian clocks to light(4,5), but clock-resetting is also achieved by alternating day and night temperatures with only 2-4 degrees C difference(6-8). This temperature sensitivity is remarkable considering that the circadian clock period (similar to 24 h) is largely independent of surrounding ambient temperatures(1,8). Here we show that Drosophila Ionotropic Receptor 25a (IR25a) is required for behavioural synchronization to low-amplitude temperature cycles. This channel is expressed in sensory neurons of internal stretch receptors previously implicated in temperature synchronization of the circadian clock(9). IR25a is required for temperature-synchronized clock protein oscillations in subsets of central clock neurons. Extracellular leg nerve recordings reveal temperature-and IR25a-dependent sensory responses, and IR25a misexpression confers temperature-dependent firing of heterologous neurons. We propose that IR25a is part of an input pathway to the circadian clock that detects small temperature differences. This pathway operates in the absence of known 'hot' and 'cold' sensors in the Drosophila antenna(10,11), revealing the existence of novel periphery-to-brain temperature signalling channels.","[Chen, Chenghao; Xu, Min; Stanewsky, Ralf] UCL, Dept Cell & Dev Biol, London WC1E 6DE, England; [Buhl, Edgar; Hodge, James J.

However, the nature of the plant signals as well as the mechanisms underlying the chemotropic response have remained elusive(3). Here we show that directed growth of the soil-inhabiting plant pathogen Fusarium oxysporum towards the roots of the host tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) is triggered by the catalytic activity of secreted class III peroxidases, a family of haem-containing enzymes present in all land plants(4). The chemotropic response requires conserved elements of the fungal cell integrity mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade(5) and the seven-pass transmembrane protein Ste2, a functional homologue of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae sex pheromone a receptor(6). We further show that directed hyphal growth of F. oxysporum towards nutrient sources such as sugars and amino acids is governed by a functionally distinct MAPK cascade. These results reveal a potentially conserved chemotropic mechanism in root-colonizing fungi, and suggest a new function for the fungal pheromone-sensing machinery in locating plant hosts in a complex environment such as the soil.","[Turra, David; El Ghalid, Mennat; Rossi, Federico; Di Pietro, Antonio] Univ Cordoba, Dept Genet, E-14071 Cordoba, Spain","Di Pietro, A (reprint author), Univ Cordoba, Dept Genet, Campus Excelencia Int Agroalimentario ceiA3, E-14071 Cordoba, Spain.",ge2dipia@uco.es,"Di Pietro, Antonio/K-9220-2014; Turra, David/G-1193-2016","Di Pietro, Antonio/0000-0001-5930-5763; Turra, David/0000-0002-0687-6754","Spanish Ministerio de Innovacion y Competitividad (MINECO) [BIO2010-15505, BIO2013-47870-R]; MINECO/ERA-NET PathoGenoMics [BIO2008-04479]; Marie Curie ITN ARIADNE from the European Commission [FP7-PEOPLE-ITN-237936]; ERASMUS student exchange program","The authors are grateful to E.

Numerous studies have suggested that epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) contributes to early-stage dissemination of cancer cells and is pivotal for invasion and metastasis of PDAC(1-4). EMT is associated with phenotypic conversion of epithelial cells into mesenchymal-like cells in cell culture conditions, although such defined mesenchymal conversion (with spindle-shaped morphology) of epithelial cells in vivo is rare, with quasi-mesenchymal phenotypes occasionally observed in the tumour (partial EMT)(5,6). Most studies exploring the functional role of EMT in tumours have depended on cell-culture-induced loss-of-function and gain-of-function experiments involving EMT-inducing transcription factors such as Twist, Snail and Zeb1 (refs 2,3,7-10). Therefore, the functional contribution of EMT to invasion and metastasis remains unclear(4,6), and genetically engineered mouse models to address a causal connection are lacking. Here we functionally probe the role of EMT in PDAC by generating mouse models of PDAC with deletion of Snail or Twist, two key transcription factors responsible for EMT. EMT suppression in the primary tumour does not alter the emergence of invasive PDAC, systemic dissemination or metastasis. Suppression of EMT leads to an increase in cancer cell proliferation with enhanced expression of nucleoside transporters in tumours, contributing to enhanced sensitivity to gemcitabine treatment and increased overall survival of mice. Collectively, our study suggests that Snail- or Twist-induced EMT is not rate-limiting for invasion and metastasis, but highlights the importance of combining EMT inhibition with chemotherapy for the treatment of pancreatic cancer.","[Zheng, Xiaofeng; Carstens, Julienne L.; Kim, Jiha; Scheible, Matthew; Kaye, Judith; Sugimoto, Hikaru; LeBleu, Valerie S.; Kalluri, Raghu] Univ Texas MD Anderson Canc Ctr, Metastasis Res Ctr, Dept Canc Biol, Houston, TX 77054 USA; [Wu, Chia-Chin] Univ Texas MD Anderson Canc Ctr, Dept Genom Med, Houston, TX 77054 USA; [Kalluri, Raghu] Baylor Coll Med, Dept Mol & Cellular Biol, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Kalluri, Raghu] Rice Univ, Dept Bioengn, Houston, TX 77030 USA","Kalluri, R (reprint author), Univ Texas MD Anderson Canc Ctr, Metastasis Res Ctr, Dept Canc Biol, Houston, TX 77054 USA.",rkalluri@mdanderson.org,,"Scheible, Matthew/0000-0001-5783-3968; Carstens, Julienne/0000-0001-9914-0430",NCI [P30CA16672]; Cancer Prevention and Research Institute of Texas; UT MDACC Khalifa Bin Zayed Al Nahya Foundation,"We wish to thank D.

By direct electron-counting cryoelectron microscopy and asymmetric reconstruction, we have determined the organization of the dsRNA genome inside quiescent CPV (q-CPV) and the in situ atomic structures of TEC within CPV in both quiescent and transcribing (t-CPV) states. We show that the ten segmented dsRNAs in CPV are organized with ten TECs in a specific, non-symmetric manner, with each dsRNA segment attached directly to a TEC. The TEC consists of two extensively interacting subunits: an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) and an NTPase VP4. We find that the bracelet domain of RdRP undergoes marked conformational change when q-CPV is converted to t-CPV, leading to formation of the RNA template entry channel and access to the polymerase active site. An amino-terminal helix from each of two subunits of the capsid shell protein (CSP) interacts with VP4 and RdRP. These findings establish the link between sensing of environmental cues by the external proteins and activation of endogenous RNA transcription by the TEC inside the virus.","[Zhang, Xing; Chang, Winston; Zhou, Z.

The universally conserved Cas1-Cas2 integrase complex catalyses spacer acquisition using a direct nucleophilic integration mechanism similar to retroviral integrases and transposases(7-13). How the Cas1-Cas2 complex selects foreign DNA substrates for integration remains unknown. Here we present X-ray crystal structures of the Escherichia coli Cas1-Cas2 complex bound to cognate 33-nucleotide protospacer DNA substrates. The protein complex creates a curved binding surface spanning the length of the DNA and splays the ends of the protospacer to allow each terminal nucleophilic 3'-OH to enter a channel leading into the Cas1 active sites. Phosphodiester backbone interactions between the protospacer and the proteins explain the sequence-nonspecific substrate selection observed in vivo(2-4).

Yet, the mechanisms of most endoperoxide biosyntheses are not well understood. Although endoperoxides have been suggested as key reaction intermediates in several cases(6-8), the only well-characterized endoperoxide biosynthetic enzyme is prostaglandin H synthase, a haem-containing enzyme(9). Fumitremorgin B endoperoxidase (FtmOx1) from Aspergillus fumigatus is the first reported alpha-ketoglutarate-dependent mononuclear non-haem iron enzyme that can catalyse an endoperoxide formation reaction(10-12). To elucidate the mechanistic details for this unique chemical transformation, we report the X-ray crystal structures of FtmOx1 and the binary complexes it forms with either the co-substrate (alpha-ketoglutarate) or the substrate (fumitremorgin B). Uniquely, after alpha-ketoglutarate has bound to the mononuclear iron centre in a bidentate fashion, the remaining open site for oxygen binding and activation is shielded from the substrate or the solvent by a tyrosine residue (Y224). Upon replacing Y224 with alanine or phenylalanine, the FtmOx1 catalysis diverts from endoperoxide formation to the more commonly observed hydroxylation. Subsequent characterizations by a combination of stopped-flow optical absorption spectroscopy and freeze-quench electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy support the presence of transient radical species in FtmOx1 catalysis. Our results help to unravel the novel mechanism for this endoperoxide formation reaction.","[Yan, Wupeng; Zhang, Yan Jessie] Univ Texas Austin, Dept Mol Biosci, Austin, TX 78712 USA; [Song, Heng; Wu, Cheng-Hsuan; Her, Ampon Sae; Pu, Yi; Wang, Shu; Naowarojna, Nathchar; Costello, Catherine E.; Liu, Pinghua] Boston Univ, Dept Chem, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Song, Fuhang; Zhang, Lixin] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Microbiol, Key Lab Pathogen Microbiol & Immunol, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Pu, Yi; Costello, Catherine E.] Boston Univ, Sch Med, Ctr Biomed Mass Spectrometry, Boston, MA 02118 USA; [Zhang, Yan Jessie] Univ Texas Austin, Inst Cellular & Mol Biol, Austin, TX 78712 USA; [Guo, Yisong; Weitz, Andrew; Hendrich, Michael P.] Carnegie Mellon Univ, Dept Chem, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA","Liu, PH (reprint author), Boston Univ, Dept Chem, 590 Commonwealth Ave, Boston, MA 02215 USA.",lzhang03@gmail.com; pinghua@bu.edu; jzhang@cm.utexas.edu,"Guo, Yisong/C-7785-2009; Song, Heng/I-1381-2016","Guo, Yisong/0000-0002-4132-3565; ","National Institutes of Health [R01 GM093903, P41 GM104603, R01 GM104896, R01 GM077387]; National Science Foundation [CHE-1309148, CHE-1126268]; Welch Foundation [F-1778]; 973 program [2013CB734000]; Carnegie Mellon University; National Distinguished Young Scholar Program in China [31125002]","We thank H.-w.

However, the role of a Dpp gradient in tissue growth remains highly controversial. Two fundamentally different models have been proposed: the 'temporal rule' model suggests that all cells of the wing imaginal disc divide upon a 50% increase in Dpp signalling, whereas the 'growth equalization model' suggests that Dpp is only essential for proliferation control of the central cells. Here, to discriminate between these two models, we generated and used morphotrap, a membrane-tethered anti-green fluorescent protein (GFP) nanobody, which enables immobilization of enhanced (e)GFP:: Dpp on the cell surface, thereby abolishing Dpp gradient formation. We find that in the absence of Dpp spreading, wing disc patterning is lost; however, lateral cells still divide at normal rates. These data are consistent with the growth equalization model, but do not fit a global temporal rule model in the wing imaginal disc.","[Harmansa, Stefan; Affolter, Markus; Aussinus, Emmanuel C.] Univ Basel, Biozentrum, Growth & Dev, Klingelbergstr 50-70, CH-4056 Basel, Switzerland; [Hamaratoglu, Fisun] Univ Lausanne, Ctr Integrat Genom, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland; [Aussinus, Emmanuel C.] Univ Zurich, IMLS, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland","Affolter, M (reprint author), Univ Basel, Biozentrum, Growth & Dev, Klingelbergstr 50-70, CH-4056 Basel, Switzerland.",Markus.Affolter@unibas.ch,,"Harmansa, Stefan/0000-0001-6668-7608; Hamaratoglu, Fisun/0000-0002-1461-9248; Affolter, Markus/0000-0002-5171-0016","'Fellowships for Excellence' International PhD Program in Molecular Life Sciences of the Biozentrum, University of Basel; SystemsX.ch initiative; MorphogenetiX projects; Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF) Professorship grant [PP00P3_150682]; Canton Basel-Stadt; Canton BaselLand; SNSF; SystemsX.ch","We would like to acknowledge the work of the late William (Bill) Gelbart, who initiated the work on Dpp. We thank S.

However, survival of S. aureus within host cells may provide a reservoir relatively protected from antibiotics, thus enabling long-term colonization of the host and explaining clinical failures and relapses after antibiotic therapy. Here we confirm that intracellular reservoirs of S. aureus in mice comprise a virulent subset of bacteria that can establish infection even in the presence of vancomycin, and we introduce a novel therapeutic that effectively kills intracellular S. aureus. This antibody-antibiotic conjugate consists of an anti-S. aureus antibody conjugated to a highly efficacious antibiotic that is activated only after it is released in the proteolytic environment of the phagolysosome. The antibody-antibiotic conjugate is superior to vancomycin for treatment of bacteraemia and provides direct evidence that intracellular S. aureus represents an important component of invasive infections.","[Lehar, Sophie M.; Kajihara, Kimberly K.; Hazenbos, Wouter L.; Morisaki, J.

Here we demonstrate that exosomes from mouse and human lung-, liver-and brain-tropic tumour cells fuse preferentially with resident cells at their predicted destination, namely lung fibroblasts and epithelial cells, liver Kupffer cells and brain endothelial cells. We show that tumour-derived exosomes uptaken by organ-specific cells prepare the pre-metastatic niche. Treatment with exosomes from lung-tropic models redirected the metastasis of bone-tropic tumour cells. Exosome proteomics revealed distinct integrin expression patterns, in which the exosomal integrins alpha(6)beta(4) and alpha(6)beta(1) were associated with lung metastasis, while exosomal integrin alpha(v)beta(5) was linked to liver metastasis. Targeting the integrins alpha(6)beta(4) and alpha(v)beta(5) decreased exosome uptake, as well as lung and liver metastasis, respectively. We demonstrate that exosome integrin uptake by resident cells activates Src phosphorylation and pro-inflammatory S100 gene expression. Finally, our clinical data indicate that exosomal integrins could be used to predict organ-specific metastasis.","[Hoshino, Ayuko; Costa-Silva, Bruno; Shen, Tang-Long; Rodrigues, Goncalo; Hashimoto, Ayako;

Despite decades of research on InsP(3)Rs, a mechanistic understanding of their structure-function relationship is lacking. Here we present the first, to our knowledge, near-atomic (4.7 angstrom) resolution electron cryomicroscopy structure of the tetrameric mammalian type 1 InsP(3)R channel in its apo-state. At this resolution, we are able to trace unambiguously similar to 85% of the protein backbone, allowing us to identify the structural elements involved in gating and modulation of this 1.3-megadalton channel. Although the central Ca2+-conduction pathway is similar to other ion channels, including the closely related ryanodine receptor, the cytosolic carboxy termini are uniquely arranged in a left-handed a-helical bundle, directly interacting with the amino-terminal domains of adjacent subunits. This configuration suggests a molecular mechanism for allosteric regulation of channel gating by intracellular signals.","[Fan, Guizhen; Baker, Mariah R.; Sinyagovskiy, Pavel A.; Serysheva, Irina I.] Univ Texas Med Sch Houston, Struct Biol Imaging Ctr, Dept Biochem & Mol Biol, 6431 Fannin St, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Baker, Matthew L.; Wang, Zhao; Chiu, Wah; Ludtke, Steven J.] Baylor Coll Med, Natl Ctr Macromol Imaging, Verna & Marrs McLean Dept Biochem & Mol Biol, Houston, TX 77030 USA","Serysheva, II (reprint author), Univ Texas Med Sch Houston, Struct Biol Imaging Ctr, Dept Biochem & Mol Biol, 6431 Fannin St, Houston, TX 77030 USA.",irina.i.serysheva@uth.tmc.edu,"wang, zhao/E-1996-2016",,"National Institutes of Health [R01GM072804, R21AR063255, S10OD016279, P41GM103832, R01GM079429, R01GM080139, R21GM100229]; American Heart Association [14RNT1980029]; Muscular Dystrophy Association [295138]; National Science Foundation [DBI-1356306]","We thank S.

While nearly 1,900 exoplanets have now been discovered and confirmed(1), none are still in the process of formation. Transition disks, protoplanetary disks with inner clearings(2-4) best explained by the influence of accreting planets(5), are natural laboratories for the study of planet formation. Some transition disks show evidence for the presence of young planets in the form of disk asymmetries(6,7) or infrared sources detected within their clearings, as in the case of LkCa 15 (refs 8, 9). Attempts to observe directly signatures of accretion onto protoplanets have hitherto proven unsuccessful(10). Here we report adaptive optics observations of LkCa 15 that probe within the disk clearing. With accurate source positions over multiple epochs spanning 2009-2015, we infer the presence of multiple companions on Keplerian orbits. We directly detect Ha emission from the innermost companion, LkCa 15 b, evincing hot (about 10,000 kelvin) gas falling deep into the potential well of an accreting protoplanet.","[Sallum, S.; Follette, K.

Rutherford discovered the atomic nucleus in 1911, and the large body of knowledge about the nuclear force that has since been acquired was derived from studies made on nucleons or nuclei. Although antinuclei up to antihelium-4 have been discovered(1) and their masses measured, little is known directly about the nuclear force between antinucleons. Here, we study antiproton pair correlations among data collected by the STAR experiment(2) at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC)(3), where gold ions are collided with a centre-of-mass energy of 200 gigaelectronvolts per nucleon pair. Antiprotons are abundantly produced in such collisions, thus making it feasible to study details of the antiproton-antiproton interaction. By applying a technique similar to Hanbury Brown and Twiss intensity interferometry(4), we show that the force between two antiprotons is attractive. In addition, we report two key parameters that characterize the corresponding strong interaction: the scattering length and the effective range of the interaction. Our measured parameters are consistent within errors with the corresponding values for proton-proton interactions. Our results provide direct information on the interaction between two antiprotons, one of the simplest systems of antinucleons, and so are fundamental to understanding the structure of more-complex antinuclei and their properties.","[Adamczyk, L.; Fulek, L.; Sikora, R.] AGH Univ Sci & Technol, PL-30059 Krakow, Poland; [Adkins, J.

This nanostructure can be ordered over a range of length scales. In biology, the principle of hierarchical ordering is often used to maximize functionality, such as strength and robustness of the material, while minimizing weight and energy cost. Methods for nanoscale imaging provide direct visual access to the ultrastructure (nanoscale structure that is too small to be imaged using light microscopy), but the field of view is limited and does not easily allow a full correlative study of changes in the ultrastructure over a macroscopic sample. Other methods of probing ultrastructure ordering, such as small-angle scattering of X-rays or neutrons, can be applied to macroscopic samples; however, these scattering methods remain constrained to two-dimensional specimens(1-4) or to isotropically oriented ultrastructures(5-7). These constraints limit the use of these methods for studying nanostructures with more complex orientation patterns, which are abundant in nature and materials science. Here, we introduce an imaging method that combines small-angle scattering with tensor tomography to probe nanoscale structures in three-dimensional macroscopic samples in a non-destructive way. We demonstrate the method by measuring the main orientation and the degree of orientation of nanoscale mineralized collagen fibrils in a human trabecula bone sample with a spatial resolution of 25 micrometres. Symmetries within the sample, such as the cylindrical symmetry commonly observed for mineralized collagen fibrils in bone(8-10), allow for tractable sampling requirements and numerical efficiency. Small-angle scattering tensor tomography is applicable to both biological and materials science specimens, and may be useful for understanding and characterizing smart or bio-inspired materials. Moreover, because the method is non-destructive, it is appropriate for in situ measurements and allows, for example, the role of ultrastructure in the mechanical response of a biological tissue or manufactured material to be studied.","[Liebi, Marianne; Menzel, Andreas; Kohlbrecher, Joachim; Bunk, Oliver; Guizar-Sicairos, Manuel] Paul Scherrer Inst, CH-5232 Villigen, Switzerland; [Georgiadis, Marios] ETH, Inst Biomech, CH-8093 Zurich, Switzerland; [Schneider, Philipp] Univ Southampton, Bioengn Sci Res Grp, Fac Engn & Environm, Southampton SO17 1BJ, Hants, England","Liebi, M (reprint author), Paul Scherrer Inst, CH-5232 Villigen, Switzerland.",marianne.liebi@psi.ch; manuel.guizar-sicairos@psi.ch,"Kohlbrecher, Joachim/C-8790-2011; Guizar-Sicairos, Manuel/I-4899-2013; Bunk, Oliver/B-7602-2013; Liebi, Marianne/A-3821-2015; Menzel, Andreas/C-4388-2012","Kohlbrecher, Joachim/0000-0001-5879-6943; Bunk, Oliver/0000-0001-6563-4053; Liebi, Marianne/0000-0002-5403-0593; Menzel, Andreas/0000-0002-0489-609X; Georgiadis, Marios/0000-0003-0733-4559",ETH Research Grant [ETH-39 11-1],"We thank M.

Although two-dimensional projection imaging has been used to characterize various materials successfully, its three-dimensional extension, SAXS computed tomography, poses substantial challenges, which have yet to be overcome. Previous work(6-11) using SAXS computed tomography was unable to preserve oriented SAXS signals during reconstruction. Here we present a solution to this problem and obtain a complete SAXS computed tomography, which preserves oriented scattering information. By introducing virtual tomography axes, we take advantage of the two-dimensional SAXS information recorded on an area detector and use it to reconstruct the full three-dimensional scattering distribution in reciprocal space for each voxel of the three-dimensional object in real space. The presented method could be of interest for a combined six-dimensional real and reciprocal space characterization of mesoscopic materials with hierarchically structured features with length scales ranging from a few nanometres to a few millimetres-for example, biomaterials such as bone or teeth, or functional materials such as fuel-cell or battery components.","[Schaff, Florian; Jud, Christoph; Pfeiffer, Franz] Tech Univ Munich, Lehrstuhl Biomed Phys, Dept Phys, D-85748 Garching, Germany; [Schaff, Florian; Jud, Christoph; Pfeiffer, Franz] Tech Univ Munich, Inst Med Tech, D-85748 Garching, Germany; [Bech, Martin] Lund Univ, Dept Med Radiat Phys, Clin Sci, S-22185 Lund, Sweden; [Zaslansky, Paul] Charite, Julius Wolff Inst, D-13353 Berlin, Germany; [Liebi, Marianne; Guizar-Sicairos, Manuel] Paul Scherrer Inst, CH-5232 Villigen, Switzerland; [Pfeiffer, Franz] Tech Univ Munich, Klinikum Rechts Isar, Inst Diagnost & Interventionelle Radiol, D-81675 Munich, Germany","Schaff, F (reprint author), Tech Univ Munich, Lehrstuhl Biomed Phys, Dept Phys, D-85748 Garching, Germany.",florian.schaff@tum.de; martin.bech@med.lu.se; franz.pfeiffer@tum.de,"Guizar-Sicairos, Manuel/I-4899-2013; Liebi, Marianne/A-3821-2015","Liebi, Marianne/0000-0002-5403-0593",DFG Cluster of Excellence Munich-Centre for Advanced Photonics (MAP); DFG Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz program; DFG (German Research Foundation) [SPP1420]; TUM Graduate School; TUM Institute for Advanced Studies (TUM-IAS),"The SAXS experiments were performed at the cSAXS beamline of the Swiss Light Source (SLS) at the Paul Scherrer Institut (PSI), Villigen, Switzerland.

Despite these benefits, its low volumetric energy density at ambient temperature and pressure presents substantial challenges, particularly for light-duty vehicles with little space available for on-board fuel storage(3). Adsorbed natural gas systems have the potential to store high densities of methane (CH4, the principal component of natural gas) within a porous material at ambient temperature and moderate pressures(4). Although activated carbons, zeolites, and metal-organic frameworks have been investigated extensively for CH4 storage(5-8), there are practical challenges involved in designing systems with high capacities and in managing the thermal fluctuations associated with adsorbing and desorbing gas from the adsorbent. Here, we use a reversible phase transition in a metal-organic framework to maximize the deliverable capacity of CH4 while also providing internal heat management during adsorption and desorption. In particular, the flexible compounds Fe(bdp) and Co(bdp) (bdp(2-) = 1,4-benzenedipyrazolate) are shown to undergo a structural phase transition in response to specific CH4 pressures, resulting in adsorption and desorption isotherms that feature a sharp 'step'. Such behaviour enables greater storage capacities than have been achieved for classical adsorbents(9), while also reducing the amount of heat released during adsorption and the impact of cooling during desorption. The pressure and energy associated with the phase transition can be tuned either chemically or by application of mechanical pressure.","[Mason, Jarad A.; Oktawiec, Julia; Taylor, Mercedes K.; Bachman, Jonathan E.; Gonzalez, Miguel I.; Long, Jeffrey R.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Chem, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Hudson, Matthew R.; Brown, Craig M.] NIST, Ctr Neutron Res, Gaithersburg, MD 20899 USA; [Rodriguez, Julien; Llewellyn, Philip L.] Aix Marseille Univ, CNRS, Lab MADIREL UMR 7246, Ctr St Jerome, F-13397 Marseille 20, France; [Cervellino, Antonio] Paul Scherrer Inst, Lab Synchrotron Radiat Condensed Matter, Swiss Light Source, CH-5232 Villigen, Switzerland; [Guagliardi, Antonietta] CNR, Ist Cristallog, I-22100 Como, Italy; [Brown, Craig M.] Univ Delaware, Chem & Biomol Engn, Newark, DE 19716 USA; [Masciocchi, Norberto] Univ Insubria, Dipartimento Sci & Alta Tecnol, I-22100 Como, Italy; [Masciocchi, Norberto] To Sca Lab, I-22100 Como, Italy","Long, JR (reprint author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Chem, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",jrlong@berkeley.edu,"LLEWELLYN, Philip/J-3458-2012; Brown, Craig/B-5430-2009; Guagliardi, Antonietta/K-4471-2015","LLEWELLYN, Philip/0000-0001-5124-7052; Brown, Craig/0000-0002-9637-9355; Guagliardi, Antonietta/0000-0001-6390-2114; Gonzalez, Miguel/0000-0003-4250-9035",Advanced Research Projects Agency - Energy (ARPA-E) of the US Department of Energy (DoE); Argonne National Laboratory [DE-AC02-06CH11357]; Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory [DE-AC02-05CH11231]; National Science Foundation,"This research was supported by the Advanced Research Projects Agency - Energy (ARPA-E) of the US Department of Energy (DoE).

The mechanisms driving this hypoxia remain under debate(1-11). We present a new high-resolution alkenone palaeotemperature reconstruction from the Gulf of Alaska that reveals two abrupt warming events of 4-5 degrees Celsius at the onset of the Bolling and Holocene intervals that coincide with sudden shifts to hypoxia at intermediate depths. The presence of diatomaceous laminations and hypoxia-tolerant benthic foraminiferal species, peaks in redox-sensitive trace metals(12,13), and enhanced N-15/N-14 ratio of organic matter(13), collectively suggest association with high export production. A decrease in O-18/O-16 values of benthic foraminifera accompanying the most severe deoxygenation event indicates subsurface warming of up to about 2 degrees Celsius. We infer that abrupt warming triggered expansion of the North Pacific OMZ through reduced oxygen solubility and increased marine productivity via physiological effects; following initiation of hypoxia, remobilization of iron from hypoxic sediments could have provided a positive feedback on ocean deoxygenation through increased nutrient utilization and carbon export. Such a biogeochemical amplification process implies high sensitivity of OMZ expansion to warming.","[Praetorius, S. K.; Mix, A. C.; Walczak, M. H.; Wolhowe, M. D.; Prahl, F.

It predicts that males obtain greater fitness benefits than females through multiple mating because sperm are cheaper to produce than eggs. Sexual selection should therefore lead to the evolution of male-biased secondary sexual characters. However, females of many species are also highly ornamented(5-7). The view that this is due to a correlated genetic response to selection on males(1,8) was widely accepted as an explanation for female ornamentation for over 100 years(5) and current theoretical(9,10) and empirical(11-13) evidence suggests that genetic constraints can limit sex-specific trait evolution. Alternatively, female ornamentation can be the outcome of direct selection for signalling needs(7,14). Since few studies have explored interspecific patterns of both male and female elaboration, our understanding of the evolution of animal ornamentation remains incomplete, especially over broad taxonomic scales. Here we use a new method to quantify plumage colour of all similar to 6,000 species of passerine birds to determine the main evolutionary drivers of ornamental colouration in both sexes. We found that conspecific male and female colour elaboration are strongly correlated, suggesting that evolutionary changes in one sex are constrained by changes in the other sex. Both sexes are more ornamented in larger species and in species living in tropical environments. Ornamentation in females (but not males) is increased in cooperative breeders-species in which female-female competition for reproductive opportunities and other resources related to breeding may be high(6). Finally, strong sexual selection on males has antagonistic effects, causing an increase in male colouration but a considerably more pronounced reduction in female ornamentation. Our results indicate that although there may be genetic constraints to sexually independent colour evolution, both female and male ornamentation are strongly and often differentially related to morphological, social and life-history variables.","[Dale, James] Massey Univ, Inst Nat & Math Sci, Auckland 0745, New Zealand; [Dey, Cody J.] McMaster Univ, Dept Biol, Hamilton, ON L8S 4K1, Canada; [Delhey, Kaspar] Monash Univ, Sch Biol Sci, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia; [Delhey, Kaspar] Max Planck Inst Ornithol, D-78315 Radolfzell am Bodensee, Germany; [Kempenaers, Bart; Valcu, Mihai] Max Planck Inst Ornithol, Dept Behav Ecol & Evolutionary Genet, D-82319 Seewiesen, Germany","Dale, J (reprint author), Massey Univ, Inst Nat & Math Sci, Auckland 0745, New Zealand.",j.dale@massey.ac.nz,,"Kempenaers, Bart/0000-0002-7505-5458; Dey, Cody/0000-0003-4947-8972",Massey University; Australian and Pacific Science Foundation [APSF 10/8]; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) Canadian Graduate Scholarship; Australian Research Council [DE120102323]; Max Planck Society,"We thank the many ornithologists and scientists who have published their data or contributed data to public databases, allowing us to conduct this study.

During embryonic development, multipotent neural crest cells are specified at the lateral borders of the neural plate before delaminating, migrating and differentiating into various cell types. In invertebrate chordates (cephalochordates and tunicates), neural plate border cells express conserved factors such as Msx, Snail and Pax3/7 and generate melanin-containing pigment cells(2-4), a derivative of the neural crest in vertebrates. However, invertebrate neural plate border cells have not been shown to generate homologues of other neural crest derivatives. Thus, proposed models of neural crest evolution postulate vertebrate-specific elaborations on an ancestral neural plate border program, through acquisition of migratory capabilities and the potential to generate several cell types(5-7). Here we show that a particular neuronal cell type in the tadpole larva of the tunicate Ciona intestinalis, the bipolar tail neuron, shares a set of features with neural-crest-derived spinal ganglia neurons in vertebrates. Bipolar tail neuron precursors derive from caudal neural plate border cells, delaminate and migrate along the paraxial mesoderm on either side of the neural tube, eventually differentiating into afferent neurons that form synaptic contacts with both epidermal sensory cells and motor neurons. We propose that the neural plate borders of the chordate ancestor already produced migratory peripheral neurons and pigment cells, and that the neural crest evolved through the acquisition of a multipotent progenitor regulatory state upstream of multiple, pre-existing neural plate border cell differentiation programs.","[Stolfi, Alberto; Christiaen, Lionel] NYU, Dept Biol, Ctr Dev Genet, New York, NY 10003 USA; [Ryan, Kerrianne; Meinertzhagen, Ian A.] Dalhousie Univ, Dept Psychol & Neurosci, Life Sci Ctr, Halifax, NS B3H 4R2, Canada","Christiaen, L (reprint author), NYU, Dept Biol, Ctr Dev Genet, New York, NY 10003 USA.",lc121@nyu.edu,,"Ryan, Kerrianne/0000-0002-9454-8768; Christiaen, Lionel/0000-0001-5930-5667; Meinertzhagen, Ian/0000-0002-6578-4526",National Science Foundation [NSF-1161835]; National Institutes of Health [GM096032]; NSERC (Ottawa) [DIS0000065],"The authors would like to thank F.

While the patterning role of Dpp secreted from a stripe of cells along the anterior-posterior compartmental boundary is well established(1,2,6), the mechanism by which a Dpp gradient directs uniform cell proliferation remains controversial and poorly understood(7-13). Here, to determine the precise spatiotemporal requirements for Dpp during wing disc development, we use CRISPR-Cas9-mediated genome editing to generate a flippase recognition target (FRT)-dependent conditional null allele. By genetically removing Dpp from its endogenous stripe domain, we confirm the requirement of Dpp for the activation of a downstream phospho-Mothers against dpp (p-Mad) gradient and the regulation of the patterning targets spalt (sal), optomotor blind (omb; also known as bifid) and brinker (brk). Surprisingly, however, third-instar wing blade primordia devoid of compartmental dpp expression maintain relatively normal rates of cell proliferation and exhibit only mild defects in growth. These results indicate that during the latter half of larval development, the Dpp morphogen gradient emanating from the anterior-posterior compartment boundary is not directly required for wing disc growth.","[Akiyama, Takuya; Gibson, Matthew C.] Stowers Inst Med Res, Kansas City, MO 64110 USA; [Gibson, Matthew C.] Univ Kansas, Sch Med, Dept Anat & Cell Biol, Kansas City, KS 66160 USA","Gibson, MC (reprint author), Stowers Inst Med Res, Kansas City, MO 64110 USA.",MG2@stowers.org,,,Stowers Institute for Medical Research,"We thank G.

Argininosuccinate synthase (ASS1) is a urea cycle enzyme that is essential in the conversion of nitrogen from ammonia and aspartate to urea. A decrease in nitrogen flux through ASS1 in the liver causes the urea cycle disorder citrullinaemia(1). In contrast to the well-studied consequences of loss of ASS1 activity on ureagenesis, the purpose of its somatic silencing in multiple cancers is largely unknown(2). Here we show that decreased activity of ASS1 in cancers supports proliferation by facilitating pyrimidine synthesis via CAD (carbamoyl-phosphate synthase 2, aspartate transcarbamylase, and dihydroorotase complex) activation. Our studies were initiated by delineating the consequences of loss of ASS1 activity in humans with two types of citrullinaemia. We find that in citrullinaemia type I (CTLN I), which is caused by deficiency of ASS1, there is increased pyrimidine synthesis and proliferation compared with citrullinaemia type II (CTLN II), in which there is decreased substrate availability for ASS1 caused by deficiency of the aspartate transporter citrin. Building on these results, we demonstrate that ASS1 deficiency in cancer increases cytosolic aspartate levels, which increases CAD activation by upregulating its substrate availability and by increasing its phosphorylation by S6K1 through the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway. Decreasing CAD activity by blocking citrin, the mTOR signalling, or pyrimidine synthesis decreases proliferation and thus may serve as a therapeutic strategy in multiple cancers where ASS1 is downregulated. Our results demonstrate that ASS1 downregulation is a novel mechanism supporting cancerous proliferation, and they provide a metabolic link between the urea cycle enzymes and pyrimidine synthesis.","[Rabinovich, Shiran; Adler, Lital; Sarver, Alona; Silberman, Alon; Agron, Shani; Stettner, Noa; Ulitsky, Igor; Erez, Ayelet] Weizmann Inst Sci, Dept Regulat Biol, IL-7610001 Rehovot, Israel; [Yizhak, Keren; Ruppin, Eytan] Tel Aviv Univ, Blavatnik Sch Comp Sci, IL-69978 Tel Aviv, Israel; [Sun, Qin; Nagamani, Sandesh C.

Such sequences are very common in the human genome, and an important determinant of the specificity of gene expression is the cooperative binding of multiple TFs to closely located motifs(4-6). However, interactions between DNA-bound TFs have not been systematically characterized. To identify TF pairs that bind cooperatively to DNA, and to characterize their spacing and orientation preferences, we have performed consecutive affinity-purification systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (CAP-SELEX) analysis of 9,400 TF-TF-DNA interactions. This analysis revealed 315 TF-TF interactions recognizing 618 heterodimeric motifs, most of which have not been previously described. The observed cooperativity occurred promiscuously between TFs from diverse structural families. Structural analysis of the TF pairs, including a novel crystal structure of MEIS1 and DLX3 bound to their identified recognition site, revealed that the interactions between the TFs were predominantly mediated by DNA. Most TF pair sites identified involved a large overlap between individual TF recognition motifs, and resulted in recognition of composite sites that were markedly different from the individual TF's motifs. Together, our results indicate that the DNA molecule commonly plays an active role in cooperative interactions that define the gene regulatory lexicon.","[Jolma, Arttu; Yin, Yimeng; Nitta, Kazuhiro R.; Dave, Kashyap; Taipale, Minna; Enge, Martin; Morgunova, Ekaterina; Taipale, Jussi] Karolinska Inst, Dept Biosci & Nutr, SE-14183 Stockholm, Sweden; [Popov, Alexander] European Synchrotron Radiat Facil, F-38043 Grenoble, France; [Kivioja, Teemu; Taipale, Jussi] Univ Helsinki, Genome Scale Biol Program, FI-00014 Helsinki, Finland","Taipale, J (reprint author), Karolinska Inst, Dept Biosci & Nutr, SE-14183 Stockholm, Sweden.",jussi.taipale@ki.se,,"Enge, Martin/0000-0001-8748-8931; Jolma, Arttu/0000-0002-2543-7490; Popov, Alexander/0000-0002-3058-8912",Finnish Academy CoE in Cancer Genetics; Center for Innovative Medicine; Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation; Goran Gustafsson Foundation; Vetenskapsradet,"We thank J.

This depends on the sequential actions of the E3 ubiquitin ligases RNF8 and RNF168 (refs 1-6), and UBC13 (also known as UBE2N), an E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme that specifically generates K63-linked ubiquitin chains(7). Whereas RNF168 is known to catalyse ubiquitylation of H2A-type histones, leading to the recruitment of repair factors such as 53BP1 (refs 8-10), the critical substrates of RNF8 and K63-linked ubiquitylation remain elusive. Here we elucidate how RNF8 and UBC13 promote recruitment of RNF168 and downstream factors to DSB sites in human cells. We establish that UBC13-dependent K63-linked ubiquitylation at DSB sites is predominantly mediated by RNF8 but not RNF168, and that H1-type linker histones, but not core histones, represent major chromatin-associated targets of this modification. The RNF168 module (UDM1) recognizing RNF8-generated ubiquitylations(11) is a high-affinity reader of K63-ubiquitylated H1, mechanistically explaining the essential roles of RNF8 and UBC13 in recruiting RNF168 to DSBs. Consistently, reduced expression or chromatin association of linker histones impair accumulation of K63-linked ubiquitin conjugates and repair factors at DSB-flanking chromatin. These results identify histone H1 as a key target of RNF8-UBC13 in DSB signalling and expand the concept of the histone code(12,13) by showing that posttranslational modifications of linker histones can serve as important marks for recognition by factors involved in genome stability maintenance, and possibly beyond.","[Thorslund, Tina; Ripplinger, Anita; Hoffmann, Saskia; Villumsen, Bine; Bekker-Jensen, Simon; Mailand, Niels] Univ Copenhagen, Fac Hlth & Med Sci, Novo Nordisk Fdn Ctr Prot Res, Ubiquitin Signaling Grp,Prot Signaling Program, Blegdamsvej 3B, DK-2200 Copenhagen, Denmark; [Wild, Thomas; Narita, Takeo; Choudhary, Chunaram] Univ Copenhagen, Fac Hlth & Med Sci, Novo Nordisk Fdn Ctr Prot Res, Prote Program, DK-2200 Copenhagen, Denmark; [Uckelmann, Michael; Sixma, Titia K.] Netherlands Canc Inst, Canc Genom Ctr, Div Biochem, NL-1066 CX Amsterdam, Netherlands","Mailand, N (reprint author), Univ Copenhagen, Fac Hlth & Med Sci, Novo Nordisk Fdn Ctr Prot Res, Ubiquitin Signaling Grp,Prot Signaling Program, Blegdamsvej 3B, DK-2200 Copenhagen, Denmark.",niels.mailand@cpr.ku.dk,,"Thorslund, Tina/0000-0001-9207-0070; choudhary, chunaram/0000-0002-9863-433X","Novo Nordisk Foundation [NNF14CC0001, NNF12OC0002114]; European Research Council; Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek-Chemische Wetenschappen (NWO-CW); Danish Cancer Society; Danish Council for Independent Research","We thank D.

This bacterial process combines nitrite and ammonium to form dinitrogen (N-2) gas, and has been estimated to synthesize up to 50% of the dinitrogen gas emitted into our atmosphere from the oceans(2). Strikingly, the anammox process relies on the highly unusual, extremely reactive intermediate hydrazine(4), a compound also used as a rocket fuel because of its high reducing power. So far, the enzymatic mechanism by which hydrazine is synthesized is unknown. Here we report the 2.7 angstrom resolution crystal structure, as well as biophysical and spectroscopic studies, of a hydrazine synthase multiprotein complex isolated from the anammox organism Kuenenia stuttgartiensis. The structure shows an elongated dimer of heterotrimers, each of which has two unique c-type haem-containing active sites, as well as an interaction point for a redox partner. Furthermore, a system of tunnels connects these active sites. The crystal structure implies a two-step mechanism for hydrazine synthesis: a three-electron reduction of nitric oxide to hydroxylamine at the active site of the gamma-subunit and its subsequent condensation with ammonia, yielding hydrazine in the active centre of the alpha-subunit. Our results provide the first, to our knowledge, detailed structural insight into the mechanism of biological hydrazine synthesis, which is of major significance for our understanding of the conversion of nitrogenous compounds in nature.","[Dietl, Andreas; Barends, Thomas R.

There has therefore been interest in identifying relevant top-down pathways from cognitive control regions in medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). Identification of such pathways could contribute to our understanding of the cognitive regulation of affect, and provide pathways for intervention. Previous studies have suggested that dorsal and ventral mPFC subregions exert opposing effects on fear, as do subregions of other structures. However, precise causal targets for top-down connections among these diverse possibilities have not been established. Here we show that the basomedial amygdala (BMA) represents the major target of ventral mPFC in amygdala in mice. Moreover, BMA neurons differentiate safe and aversive environments, and BMA activation decreases fear-related freezing and high-anxiety states. Lastly, we show that the ventral mPFC-BMA projection implements top-down control of anxiety state and learned freezing, both at baseline and in stress-induced anxiety, defining a broadly relevant new top-down behavioural regulation pathway.","[Adhikari, Avishek; Lerner, Talia N.; Finkelstein, Joel; Pak, Sally; Jennings, Joshua H.; Davidson, Thomas J.; Ferenczi, Emily; Gunaydin, Lisa A.; Irzabekov, Julie J.

Here we studied human melanomas that differed in their metastasis histories in patients and in their capacity to metastasize in NOD-SCID-Il2rg(-/-) (NSG) mice. We show that melanomas had high frequencies of cells that formed subcutaneous tumours, but much lower percentages of cells that formed tumours after intravenous or intrasplenic transplantation, particularly among inefficiently metastasizing melanomas. Melanoma cells in the blood and visceral organs experienced oxidative stress not observed in established subcutaneous tumours. Successfully metastasizing melanomas underwent reversible metabolic changes during metastasis that increased their capacity to withstand oxidative stress, including increased dependence on NADPH-generating enzymes in the folate pathway. Antioxidants promoted distant metastasis in NSG mice. Folate pathway inhibition using low-dose methotrexate, ALDH1L2 knockdown, or MTHFD1 knockdown inhibited distant metastasis without significantly affecting the growth of subcutaneous tumours in the same mice. Oxidative stress thus limits distant metastasis by melanoma cells in vivo.","[Piskounova, Elena; Agathocleous, Michalis; Murphy, Malea M.; Hu, Zeping; Huddlestun, Sara E.; Zhao, Zhiyu; DeBerardinis, Ralph J.; Morrison, Sean J.] Univ Texas SW Med Ctr Dallas, Childrens Res Inst, Dallas, TX 75390 USA; [Piskounova, Elena; Agathocleous, Michalis; Murphy, Malea M.; Hu, Zeping; Huddlestun, Sara E.; Zhao, Zhiyu; DeBerardinis, Ralph J.; Morrison, Sean J.] Univ Texas SW Med Ctr Dallas, Dept Pediat, Dallas, TX 75390 USA; [Leitch, A.

Previously, we identified an erythroid enhancer of human BCL11A, subject to common genetic variation associated with the fetal haemoglobin level, the mouse orthologue of which is necessary for eiythroid BCL11A expression. Here we develop pooled clustered regularly interspaced paiindromic repeat (CRISPR)-Cas9 guide RNA libraries to perform in situ saturating mutagenesis of the human and mouse enhancers. This approach reveals critical minimal features and discrete vulnerabilities of these enhancers. Despite conserved function of the composite enhancers, their architecture diverges. The crucial human sequences appear to be primate-specific. Through editing of primary human progenitors and mouse transgenesis, we validate the BCL11A erythroid enhancer as a target for fetal haemoglobin reinduction.

Here we present the structure of a complete Na+-activated K+ channel, chicken Slo2.2, in the Na+-free state, determined by cryo-electron microscopy at a nominal resolution of 4.5 angstroms. The channel is composed of a large cytoplasmic gating ring, in which resides the Na+-binding site and a transmembrane domain that closely resembles voltage-gated K+ channels. In the structure, the cytoplasmic domain adopts a closed conformation and the ion conduction pore is also closed. The structure reveals features that can explain the unusually high conductance of Slo channels and how contraction of the cytoplasmic gating ring closes the pore.","[Hite, Richard K.; Yuan, Peng; Hsuing, Yichun; MacKinnon, Roderick] Rockefeller Univ, New York, NY 10065 USA; [Hite, Richard K.; Yuan, Peng; Hsuing, Yichun; MacKinnon, Roderick] Howard Hughes Med Inst, New York, NY 10065 USA; [Li, Zongli; Walz, Thomas] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Cell Biol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Li, Zongli; Walz, Thomas] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Boston, MA 02115 USA","MacKinnon, R (reprint author), Rockefeller Univ, 1230 York Ave, New York, NY 10065 USA.",mackinn@rockefeller.edu,,,National Science Foundation [ACI-1053575];  [GM43949],"We thank Z.

Recent results have shown that M dwarfs host Earth-sized planets in great numbers(1,2): the average number of M-dwarf planets that are between 0.5 to 1.5 times the size of Earth is at least 1.4 per star(3). The nearest such planets known to transit their star are 39 parsecs away(4), too distant for detailed follow-up observations to measure the planetary masses or to study their atmospheres. Here we report observations of GJ 1132b, a planet with a size of 1.2 Earth radii that is transiting a small star 12 parsecs away. Our Doppler mass measurement of GJ 1132b yields a density consistent with an Earth-like bulk composition, similar to the compositions of the six known exoplanets with masses less than six times that of the Earth and precisely measured densities(5-11). Receiving 19 times more stellar radiation than the Earth, the planet is too hot to be habitable but is cool enough to support a substantial atmosphere, one that has probably been considerably depleted of hydrogen. Because the host star is nearby and only 21 per cent the radius of the Sun, existing and upcoming telescopes will be able to observe the composition and dynamics of the planetary atmosphere.","[Berta-Thompson, Zachory K.] MIT, Kavli Inst Astrophys & Space Res, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Berta-Thompson, Zachory K.; Irwin, Jonathan; Charbonneau, David; Newton, Elisabeth R.; Dittmann, Jason A.; Stark, Antony A.] Harvard Smithsonian Ctr Astrophys, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Astudillo-Defru, Nicola; Bouchy, Francois; Lovis, Christophe; Mayor, Michel; Pepe, Francesco; Udry, Stephane] Univ Geneva, Observ Geneve, CH-1290 Sauverny, Switzerland; [Bonfils, Xavier; Delfosse, Xavier; Forveille, Thierry; Wuensche, Anael] Univ Grenoble Alpes, IPAG, F-33000 Grenoble, France; [Bonfils, Xavier; Delfosse, Xavier; Forveille, Thierry; Wuensche, Anael] CNRS, IPAG, F-38000 Grenoble, France; [Gillon, Michael; Jehin, Emmanuel] Univ Liege, Inst Astrophys & Geophys, B-4000 Liege, Belgium; [Stalder, Brian] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Inst Astron, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; [Bouchy, Francois] Univ Aix Marseille 1, CNRS, Lab Astrophys Marseille, UMR 6110, F-13388 Marseille 13, France; [Neves, Vasco] Univ Fed Rio Grande do Norte, Dept Fis, BR-59072970 Natal, RN, Brazil; [Santos, Nuno C.] Univ Porto, Inst Astrofis & Ciencias Espaco, CAUP, P-4150762 Oporto, Portugal; [Santos, Nuno C.] Univ Porto, Fac Ciencias, Dept Fis & Astron, P-4169007 Oporto, Portugal","Berta-Thompson, ZK (reprint author), MIT, Kavli Inst Astrophys & Space Res, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",zkbt@mit.edu,,"Berta-Thompson, Zachory/0000-0002-3321-4924; Astudillo-Defru, Nicola/0000-0002-8462-515X; Stark, Antony/0000-0002-2718-9996; Bonfils, Xavier/0000-0001-9003-8894; Santos, Nuno/0000-0003-4422-2919",David and Lucile Packard Fellowship for Science and Engineering; National Science Foundation; John Templeton Foundation; Belgian Fund for Scientific Research; MIT Torres Fellowship for Exoplanet Research; French Agence Nationale de la Recherche; European Research Council; CNPq/BJT Post Doctorate fellowship; INCT INEspaco; Portuguese National Science Foundation (FCT); COMPETE program,"We thank the staff at the Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory for assistance in the construction and operation of MEarth-South; J.

In atomic physics, robust two-qubit entanglement is typically achieved by strong, long-range interactions in the form of either Coulomb interactions between ions or dipolar interactions between Rydberg atoms(1-4). Although such interactions allow fast quantum gates, the interacting atoms must overcome the associated coupling to the environment and crosstalk among qubits(5-)8. Local interactions, such as those requiring substantial wavefunction overlap, can alleviate these detrimental effects; however, such interactions present a new challenge: to distribute entanglement, qubits must be transported, merged for interaction, and then isolated for storage and subsequent operations. Here we show how, using a mobile optical tweezer, it is possible to prepare and locally entangle two ultracold neutral atoms, and then separate them while preserving their entanglement(9-11). Ground-state neutral atom experiments have measured dynamics consistent with spin entanglement(10,12,13), and have detected entanglement with macroscopic observables(14,15); we are now able to demonstrate position-resolved two-particle coherence via application of a local gradient and parity measurements'. This new entanglement-verification protocol could be applied to arbitrary spin-entangled states of spatially separated atoms(16,17). The local entangling operation is achieved via spin-exchange interactions(9-11), and quantum tunnelling is used to combine and separate atoms. These techniques provide a framework for dynamically entangling remote qubits via local operations within a large-scale quantum register.","[Kaufman, A. M.; Lester, B. J.; Wall, M. L.; Rey, A.

Recent developments in theory and experiment have provided a framework for understanding the anomalous Hall effect using Berry-phase concepts', and this perspective has led to predictions that, under certain conditions, a large anomalous Hall effect may appear in spin liquids and antiferromagnets without net spin magnetization(4-8). Although such a spontaneous Hall effect has now been observed in a spin liquid state(9), a zero-field anomalous Hall effect has hitherto not been reported for antiferromagnets. Here we report empirical evidence for a large anomalous Hall effect in an antiferromagnet that has vanishingly small magnetization. In particular, we find that Mn3Sn, an antiferromagnet that has a non-collinear 120-degree spin order(10,11), exhibits a large anomalous Hall conductivity of around 20 per ohm per centimetre at room temperature and more than 100 per ohm per centimetre at low temperatures, reaching the same order of magnitude as in ferromagnetic metals(3). Notably, the chiral antiferromagnetic state has a very weak and soft ferromagnetic moment of about 0.002 Bohr magnetons per Mn atom (refs 10, 12), allowing us to switch the sign of the Hall effect with a small magnetic field of around a few hundred oersted. This soft response of the large anomalous Hall effect could be useful for various applications including spintronics for example, to develop a memory device that produces almost no perturbing stray fields.","[Nakatsuji, Satoru; Kiyohara, Naoki; Higo, Tomoya] Univ Tokyo, Inst Solid State Phys, Kashiwa, Chiba 2778581, Japan; [Nakatsuji, Satoru] Japan Sci & Technol Agcy JST, PRESTO, Kawaguchi, Saitama 3320012, Japan","Nakatsuji, S (reprint author), Univ Tokyo, Inst Solid State Phys, Kashiwa, Chiba 2778581, Japan.",satoru@issp.u-tokyo.ac.jp,,,"PRESTO; Japan Science and Technology Agency; Program for Advancing Strategic International Networks to Accelerate the Circulation of Talented Researchers [R2604]; Japanese Society for the Promotion of Science [15H05882, 15H05883];  [25707030]","We thank M.

For example, liquid solvents, rather than porous solids, are the most mature technology for post-combustion capture of carbon dioxide because liquid circulation systems are more easily retrofitted to existing plants. Solid porous adsorbents offer major benefits, such as lower energy penalties in adsorption-desorption cycles(4), but they are difficult to implement in conventional flow processes. Materials that combine the properties of fluidity and permanent porosity could therefore offer technological advantages, but permanent porosity is not associated with conventional liquids(5). Here we report free-flowing liquids whose bulk properties are determined by their permanent porosity. To achieve this, we designed cage molecules(6,7) that provide a well-defined pore space and that are highly soluble in solvents whose molecules are too large to enter the pores. The concentration of unoccupied cages can thus be around 500 times greater than in other molecular solutions that contain cavities(8-10), resulting in a marked change in bulk properties, such as an eightfold increase in the solubility of methane gas. Our results provide the basis for development of a new class of functional porous materials for chemical processes, and we present a one-step, multigram scale-up route for highly soluble 'scrambled' porous cages prepared from a mixture of commercially available reagents. The unifying design principle for these materials is the avoidance of functional groups that can penetrate into the molecular cage cavities.","[Giri, Nicola; James, Stuart L.] Queens Univ Belfast, Sch Chem & Chem Engn, Belfast BT9 5AG, Antrim, North Ireland; [Del Popolo, Mario G.; Melaugh, Gavin] Queens Univ Belfast, Sch Math & Phys, Belfast BT7 1NN, Antrim, North Ireland; [Del Popolo, Mario G.] Univ Nacl Cuyo, CONICET, RA-5500 Mendoza, Argentina; [Del Popolo, Mario G.] Univ Nacl Cuyo, Fac Ciencias Exactas & Nat, RA-5500 Mendoza, Argentina; [Greenaway, Rebecca L.; Cooper, Andrew I.] Univ Liverpool, Dept Chem, Liverpool L69 7ZD, Merseyside, England; [Greenaway, Rebecca L.; Cooper, Andrew I.] Univ Liverpool, Ctr Mat Discovery, Liverpool L69 7ZD, Merseyside, England; [Raetzke, Klaus; Koschine, Toenjes] Univ Kiel, Tech Fak, D-24143 Kiel, Germany; [Pison, Laure; Gomes, Margarida F.

Understanding viable scenarios for the onset of subduction and plate tectonics(2,3) is hampered by the fact that subduction initiation processes must have been markedly different before the onset of global plate tectonics because most present-day subduction initiation mechanisms require acting plate forces and existing zones of lithospheric weakness, which are both consequences of plate tectonics(4). However, plume-induced subduction initiation(5-9) could have started the first subduction zone without the help of plate tectonics. Here, we test this mechanism using high-resolution three-dimensional numerical thermomechanical modelling. We demonstrate that three key physical factors combine to trigger self-sustained subduction: (1) a strong, negatively buoyant oceanic lithosphere; (2) focused magmatic weakening and thinning of lithosphere above the plume; and (3) lubrication of the slab interface by hydrated crust. We also show that plume-induced subduction could only have been feasible in the hotter early Earth for old oceanic plates. In contrast, younger plates favoured episodic lithospheric drips rather than self-sustained subduction and global plate tectonics.","[Gerya, T.

However, the association of humans with A. mellifera predates post-industrial-revolution agriculture, as evidenced by the widespread presence of ancient Egyptian bee iconography dating to the Old Kingdom (approximately 2400 BC)(1). There are also indications of Stone Age people harvesting bee products; for example, honey hunting is interpreted from rock art(2) in a prehistoric Holocene context and a beeswax find in a pre-agriculturalist site(3). However, when and where the regular association of A. mellifera with agriculturalists emerged is unknown(4). One of the major products of A. mellifera is beeswax, which is composed of a complex suite of lipids including n-alkanes, n-alkanoic acids and fatty acyl wax esters. The composition is highly constant as it is determined genetically through the insect's biochemistry. Thus, the chemical 'fingerprint' of beeswax provides a reliable basis for detecting this commodity in organic residues preserved at archaeological sites, which we now use to trace the exploitation by humans of A. mellifera temporally and spatially. Here we present secure identifications of beeswax in lipid residues preserved in pottery vessels of Neolithic Old World farmers. The geographical range of bee product exploitation is traced in Neolithic Europe, the Near East and North Africa, providing the palaeoecological range of honeybees during prehistory. Temporally, we demonstrate that bee products were exploited continuously, and probably extensively in some regions, at least from the seventh millennium cal BC, likely fulfilling a variety of technological and cultural functions. The close association of A. mellifera with Neolithic farming communities dates to the early onset of agriculture and may provide evidence for the beginnings of a domestication process.","[Roffet-Salque, Melanie; Evershed, Richard R.; Cramp, Lucy J.

These features are particularly striking as tetrapod limb development has otherwise been shown to be a highly conserved process(1,2). It remains elusive whether the capacity to regenerate limbs in salamanders is mechanistically and evolutionarily linked to the aberrant pattern of limb development; both are features classically regarded as unique to urodeles(3). New molecular data suggest that salamander-specific orphan genes play a central role in limb regeneration and may also be involved in the preaxial patterning during limb development(4,5). Here we show that preaxial polarity in limb development was present in various groups of temnospondyl amphibians of the Carboniferous and Permian periods, including the dissorophoids Apateon and Micromelerpeton, as well as the stereospondylomorph Sclerocephalus. Limb regeneration has also been reported in Micromelerpeton(6), demonstrating that both features were already present together in antecedents of modern salamanders 290 million years ago. Furthermore, data from lepospondyl 'microsaurs' on the amniote stem indicate that these taxa may have shown some capacity for limb regeneration and were capable of tail regeneration(7), including re-patterning of the caudal vertebral column that is otherwise only seen in salamander tail regeneration. The data from fossils suggest that salamander-like regeneration is an ancient feature of tetrapods that was subsequently lost at least once in the lineage leading to amniotes. Salamanders are the only modern tetrapods that retained regenerative capacities as well as preaxial polarity in limb development.","[Froebisch, Nadia B.; Bickelmann, Constanze; Witzmann, Florain] Leibniz Inst Evolut & Biodivers Sci, Museum Nat Kunde, D-10115 Berlin, Germany; [Olori, Jennifer C.] SUNY Coll Oswego, Dept Biol Sci, Oswego, NY 13126 USA; [Witzmann, Florain] Brown Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Providence, RI 02912 USA","Frobisch, NB (reprint author), Leibniz Inst Evolut & Biodivers Sci, Museum Nat Kunde, Invalidenstr 43, D-10115 Berlin, Germany.",nadia.froebisch@mfn-berlin.de,,"Olori, Jennifer/0000-0003-0479-6264",DFG Emmy Noether Grant [FR 2647/5-1]; Jackson School of Geosciences; Banks Fellowship; Society of Vertebrate Paleontology Estes Memorial Grant; Paleontological Society Lane Student Award; Feodor-Lynen Fellowship of the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation,"We thank B.

Fundamental productive elements of modern economies, such as workers and crops, exhibit highly non-linear responses to local temperature even in wealthy countries(3,4). In contrast, aggregate macroeconomic productivity of entire wealthy countries is reported not to respond to temperature(5), while poor countries respond only linearly(5,6). Resolving this conflict between micro and macro observations is critical to understanding the role of wealth in coupled human-natural systems(7,8) and to anticipating the global impact of climate change(9,10). Here we unify these seemingly contradictory results by accounting for non-linearity at the macro scale. We show that overall economic productivity is non-linear in temperature for all countries, with productivity peaking at an annual average temperature of 13 degrees C and declining strongly at higher temperatures. The relationship is globally generalizable, unchanged since 1960, and apparent for agricultural and non-agricultural activity in both rich and poor countries. These results provide the first evidence that economic activity in all regions is coupled to the global climate and establish a new empirical foundation for modelling economic loss in response to climate change(11,12), with important implications. If future adaptation mimics past adaptation, unmitigated warming is expected to reshape the global economy by reducing average global incomes roughly 23% by 2100 and widening global income inequality, relative to scenarios without climate change. In contrast to prior estimates, expected global losses are approximately linear in global mean temperature, with median losses many times larger than leading models indicate.","[Burke, Marshall] Stanford Univ, Dept Earth Syst Sci, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Burke, Marshall] Stanford Univ, Ctr Food Secur & Environm, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Hsiang, Solomon M.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Goldman Sch Publ Policy, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Hsiang, Solomon M.; Miguel, Edward] Univ Calif Berkeley, Natl Bur Econ Res, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Miguel, Edward] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Econ, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA","Burke, M (reprint author), Stanford Univ, Dept Earth Syst Sci, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",mburke@stanford.edu,,"Burke, Marshall/0000-0003-4288-5858",,,,27,65,68,25,94,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,12-Nov,2015,527,7577,,,,,235,+,,10.1038/nature15725,,16,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,CV6RC,WOS:000364396700045,26503051,No,Y,N,11/19/17

Although the hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) transcriptional pathway that controls long-term responses to low oxygen (hypoxia) has been established(1), the pathway that mediates acute responses to hypoxia in mammals is not well understood. Here we show that the olfactory receptor gene Olfr78 is highly and selectively expressed in oxygen-sensitive glomus cells of the carotid body, a chemosensory organ at the carotid artery bifurcation that monitors blood oxygen and stimulates breathing within seconds when oxygen declines(2). Olfr78 mutants fail to increase ventilation in hypoxia but respond normally to hypercapnia. Glomus cells are present in normal numbers and appear structurally intact, but hypoxia-induced carotid body activity is diminished. Lactate, a metabolite that rapidly accumulates in hypoxia and induces hyperventilation(3-6), activates Olfr78 in heterologous expression experiments, induces calcium transients in glomus cells, and stimulates carotid sinus nerve activity through Olfr78. We propose that, in addition to its role in olfaction, Olfr78 acts as a hypoxia sensor in the breathing circuit by sensing lactate produced when oxygen levels decline.","[Chang, Andy J.; Ortega, Fabian E.; Krasnow, Mark A.] Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Dept Biochem, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Chang, Andy J.; Ortega, Fabian E.; Krasnow, Mark A.] Stanford Univ, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Riegler, Johannes] Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Dept Med, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Adison, Daniel V.

Clinical trials have demonstrated that, for the first time in human history, the potential exists to eradicate a chronic viral disease using combination therapies that contain only direct-acting antiviral agents(3). HCV nonstructural protein 5A (NS5A) is a multifunctional protein required for several stages of the virus replication cycle(4). NS5A replication complex inhibitors, exemplified by daclatasvir (DCV; also known as BMS-790052 and Daklinza), belong to the most potent class of direct-acting anti-HCV agents described so far, with in vitro activity in the picomolar (pM) to low nanomolar (nM) range. The potency observed in vitro has translated into clinical efficacy, with HCV RNA declining by similar to 3-4 log(10) in infected patients after administration of single oral doses of DCV. Understanding the exceptional potency of DCV was a key objective of this study. Here we show that although DCV and an NS5A inhibitor analogue (Syn-395) are inactive against certain NS5A resistance variants, combinations of the pair enhance DCV potency by >1,000-fold, restoring activity to the pM range. This synergistic effect was validated in vivo using an HCV-infected chimaeric mouse model. The cooperative interaction of a pair of compounds suggests that NS5A protein molecules communicate with each other: one inhibitor binds to resistant NS5A, causing a conformational change that is transmitted to adjacent NS5As, resensitizing resistant NS5A so that the second inhibitor can act to restore inhibition. This unprecedented synergistic anti-HCV activity also enhances the resistance barrier of DCV, providing additional options for HCV combination therapy and new insight into the role of NS5A in the HCV replication cycle.","[Sun, Jin-Hua; O'Boyle, Donald R., II; Fridell, Robert A.; Wang, Chunfu; Roberts, Susan B.; Nower, Peter; Liu, Mengping; Rigat, Karen; Cockett, Mark; Lemm, Julie A.; Gao, Min] Bristol Myers Squibb Res & Dev, Dept Virol, Wallingford, CT 06492 USA; [Langley, David R.] Bristol Myers Squibb Res & Dev, Comp Assisted Drug Design, Wallingford, CT 06492 USA; [Johnson, Benjamin M.; Moulin, Frederic; Nophsker, Michelle J.; Kramer, Melissa] Bristol Myers Squibb Res & Dev, Pharmaceut Candidate Optimizat, Wallingford, CT 06492 USA; [Wang, Ying-Kai] Bristol Myers Squibb Res & Dev, Leads Discovery & Optimizat, Wallingford, CT 06492 USA; [Tu, Yong; Hewawasam, Piyasena; Kadow, John; Meanwell, Nicholas A.; Belema, Makonen] Bristol Myers Squibb Res & Dev, Discovery Chem, Wallingford, CT 06492 USA","Gao, M (reprint author), Bristol Myers Squibb Res & Dev, Dept Virol, 5 Res Pkwy, Wallingford, CT 06492 USA.",Min.Gao@bms.com,,"Sun, Jin-hua/0000-0003-2813-3633",,,,28,14,14,0,12,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,12-Nov,2015,527,7577,,,,,245,+,,10.1038/nature15711,,15,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,CV6RC,WOS:000364396700047,26536115,No,,,11/19/17

However, its role in cancer immunopathology and immunotherapy is poorly understood. Using human ovarian cancers as our model, here we show that enhancer of zeste homologue 2 (EZH2)-mediated histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) and DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1)-mediated DNA methylation repress the tumour production of T helper 1 (T(H)1)-type chemokines CXCL9 and CXCL10, and subsequently determine effector T-cell trafficking to the tumour microenvironment. Treatment with epigenetic modulators removes the repression and increases effector T-cell tumour infiltration, slows down tumour progression, and improves the therapeutic efficacy of programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1; also known as B7-H1) checkpoint blockade(2-4) and adoptive T-cell transfusion(5) in tumour-bearing mice. Moreover, tumour EZH2 and DNMT1 are negatively associated with tumour-infiltrating CD8(+) T cells and patient outcome. Thus, epigenetic silencing of T(H)1-type chemokines is a novel immune-evasion mechanism of tumours. Selective epigenetic reprogramming alters the T-cell landscape(6) in cancer and may enhance the clinical efficacy of cancer therapy.","[Peng, Dongjun; Kryczek, Ilona; Nagarsheth, Nisha; Wei, Shuang; Wang, Weimin; Zhao, Ende; Vatan, Linda; Szeliga, Wojciech; Zou, Weiping] Univ Michigan, Sch Med, Dept Surg, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Kryczek, Ilona; Nagarsheth, Nisha; Zou, Weiping] Univ Michigan, Grad Program Immunol, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Zhao, Lili] Univ Michigan, Sch Med, Dept Biostat, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Sun, Yuqing; Dou, Yali; Cho, Kathleen] Univ Michigan, Sch Med, Dept Pathol, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Kotarski, Jan; Tarkowski, Rafal] Med Univ Lublin, Dept Gynecol Oncol & Gynecol 1, PL-20081 Lublin, Poland; [Cho, Kathleen; Liu, Rebecca; Zou, Weiping] Univ Michigan, Ctr Comprehens Canc, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Hensley-Alford, Sharon; Munkarah, Adnan] Henry Ford Hlth Syst, Dept Womens Hlth Serv, Detroit, MI 48202 USA; [Liu, Rebecca] Univ Michigan, Sch Med, Dept Obstet & Gynecol, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Zou, Weiping] Univ Michigan, Grad Program Tumor Biol, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA","Zou, WP (reprint author), Univ Michigan, Sch Med, Dept Surg, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",wzou@med.umich.edu,"Zhao, Ende/B-9851-2013","Zhao, Ende/0000-0002-1355-6919","NIH [CA190176, CA123088, CA099985, CA156685, CA193136, CA152470, CA171306, 5P30CA46592]; Rivkin Ovarian Cancer Center; Ovarian Cancer Research Fund","This work is supported (in part) by the NIH grants (CA190176; CA123088; CA099985; CA156685; CA193136; CA152470; CA171306; 5P30CA46592), the Rivkin Ovarian Cancer Center, and the Ovarian Cancer Research Fund.

How these enzymes find small modifications within the genome is a current area of intensive research. A hallmark of these and other DNA repair enzymes is their use of base flipping to sequester modified nucleotides from the DNA helix and into an active site pocket(2-5). Consequently, base flipping is generally regarded as an essential aspect of lesion recognition and a necessary precursor to base excision. Here we present the first, to our knowledge, DNA glycosylase mechanism that does not require base flipping for either binding or catalysis. Using the DNA glycosylase AlkD from Bacillus cereus, we crystallographically monitored excision of an alkylpurine substrate as a function of time, and reconstructed the steps along the reaction coordinate through structures representing substrate, intermediate and product complexes. Instead of directly interacting with the damaged nucleobase, AlkD recognizes aberrant base pairs through interactions with the phosphoribose backbone, while the lesion remains stacked in the DNA duplex. Quantum mechanical calculations revealed that these contacts include catalytic charge-dipole and CH-p interactions that preferentially stabilize the transition state. We show in vitro and in vivo how this unique means of recognition and catalysis enables AlkD to repair large adducts formed by yatakemycin, a member of the duocarmycin family of antimicrobial natural products exploited in bacterial warfare and chemotherapeutic trials(6,7). Bulky adducts of this or any type are not excised by DNA glycosylases that use a traditional base-flipping mechanism(5). Hence, these findings represent a new model for DNA repair and provide insights into catalysis of base excision.","[Mullins, Elwood A.; Shi, Rongxin; Parsons, Zachary D.; Eichman, Brandt F.] Vanderbilt Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Nashville, TN 37232 USA; [Mullins, Elwood A.; Shi, Rongxin; Parsons, Zachary D.; Eichman, Brandt F.] Vanderbilt Univ, Ctr Struct Biol, Nashville, TN 37232 USA; [Yuen, Philip K.; David, Sheila S.] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Chem, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Igarashi, Yasuhiro] Toyama Prefectural Univ, Biotechnol Res Ctr, Toyama 9390398, Japan","Eichman, BF (reprint author), Vanderbilt Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Nashville, TN 37232 USA.",brandt.eichman@vanderbilt.edu,,"Shi, Rongxin/0000-0002-3930-8534; Eichman, Brandt/0000-0002-0965-2297","National Science Foundation [MCB-1122098, MCB-1517695]; National Institutes of Health [R01ES019625, R01CA067985, S10RR026915]; US Department of Energy [DE-AC02-06CH11357]; Vanderbilt Training Program in Environmental Toxicology [T32ES07028]","We thank C.

Glucose in animals and sucrose in plants serve as the dominant distribution forms. Cellular sugar uptake and release require vesicular and/or plasma membrane transport proteins. Humans and plants use proteins from three superfamilies for sugar translocation: the major facilitator superfamily (MFS), the sodium solute symporter family (SSF; only in the animal kingdom), and SWEETs1-5. SWEETs carry mono-and disaccharides(6) across vacuolar or plasma membranes. Plant SWEETs play key roles in sugar translocation between compartments, cells, and organs, notably in nectar secretion(7), phloem loading for long distance translocation(8), pollen nutrition(9), and seed filling(10). Plant SWEETs cause pathogen susceptibility possibly by sugar leakage from infected cells(3,11,12). The vacuolar Arabidopsis thaliana AtSWEET2 sequesters sugars in root vacuoles; loss-of-function mutants show increased susceptibility to Pythium infection(13). Here we show that its orthologue, the vacuolar glucose transporter OsSWEET2b from rice (Oryza sativa), consists of an asymmetrical pair of triple-helix bundles, connected by an inversion linker transmembrane helix (TM4) to create the translocation pathway. Structural and biochemical analyses show OsSWEET2b in an apparent inward (cytosolic) open state forming homomeric trimers. TM4 tightly interacts with the first triple-helix bundle within a protomer and mediates key contacts among protomers. Structure-guided mutagenesis of the close paralogue SWEET1 from Arabidopsis identified key residues in substrate translocation and protomer crosstalk. Insights into the structure-function relationship of SWEETs are valuable for understanding the transport mechanism of eukaryotic SWEETs and may be useful for engineering sugar flux.","[Tao, Yuyong; Li, Shuo; Xu, Yan; Feng, Liang] Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Dept Mol & Cellular Physiol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Cheung, Lily S.; Eom, Joon-Seob; Chen, Li-Qing; Frommer, Wolf B.] Carnegie Inst Sci, Dept Plant Biol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Li, Shuo] Sichuan Univ, Coll Life Sci, Ctr Growth Metab & Aging, Key Lab Bioresource & Ecoenvironm,Minist Educ, Chengdu 610014, Peoples R China; [Perry, Kay] Cornell Univ, Argonne Natl Lab, NE CAT, Argonne, IL 60439 USA; [Perry, Kay] Cornell Univ, Argonne Natl Lab, Dept Chem & Chem Biol, Argonne, IL 60439 USA","Feng, L (reprint author), Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Dept Mol & Cellular Physiol, 279 Campus Dr, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",liangf@stanford.edu,"Frommer, Wolf/K-5042-2017","Frommer, Wolf/0000-0001-6465-0115; Cheung, Lily/0000-0001-8089-7783","Stanford University; Harold and Leila Y.

While it is agreed that these pressures are increasing, views divide on how they may be alleviated. Some suggest technological advances will automatically keep us from transgressing key environmental thresholds; others that policy reform can reconcile economic and ecological goals; while a third school argues that only a fundamental shift in societal values can keep human demands within the Earth's ecological limits. Here we use novel integrated analysis of the energy-water-food nexus, rural land use (including biodiversity), material flows and climate change to explore whether mounting ecological pressures in Australia can be reversed, while the population grows and living standards improve. We show that, in the right circumstances, economic and environmental outcomes can be decoupled. Although economic growth is strong across all scenarios, environmental performance varies widely: pressures are projected to more than double, stabilize or fall markedly by 2050. However, we find no evidence that decoupling will occur automatically. Nor do we find that a shift in societal values is required. Rather, extensions of current policies that mobilize technology and incentivize reduced pressure account for the majority of differences in environmental performance. Our results show that Australia can make great progress towards sustainable prosperity, if it chooses to do so.","[Hatfield-Dodds, Steve; Schandl, Heinz; Chiew, Francis H.

However, it has remained unclear whether cells might exploit the dynamic interaction of these pulses to control gene expression. Here, using quantitative single-cell time-lapse imaging of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we show that the pulsatile transcription factors Msn2 and Mig1 combinatorially regulate their target genes through modulation of their relative pulse timing. The activator Msn2 and repressor Mig1 showed pulsed activation in either a temporally overlapping or non-overlapping manner during their transient response to different inputs, with only the non-overlapping dynamics efficiently activating target gene expression.

Here we show that ion channels conduct long-range electrical signals within bacterial biofilm communities through spatially propagating waves of potassium. These waves result from a positive feedback loop, in which a metabolic trigger induces release of intracellular potassium, which in turn depolarizes neighbouring cells. Propagating through the biofilm, this wave of depolarization coordinates metabolic states among cells in the interior and periphery of the biofilm. Deletion of the potassium channel abolishes this response. As predicted by a mathematical model, we further show that spatial propagation can be hindered by specific genetic perturbations to potassium channel gating. Together, these results demonstrate a function for ion channels in bacterial biofilms, and provide a prokaryotic paradigm for active, long-range electrical signalling in cellular communities.","[Prindle, Arthur; Liu, Jintao; Ly, San; Sueel, Guerol M.] Univ Calif San Diego, Div Biol Sci, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Asally, Munehiro] Univ Warwick, Sch Life Sci, Warwick Integrat Synthet Biol Ctr, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England; [Garcia-Ojalvo, Jordi] Univ Pompeu Fabra, Dept Expt & Hlth Sci, Barcelona 08003, Spain","Suel, GM (reprint author), Univ Calif San Diego, Div Biol Sci, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.",gsuel@ucsd.edu,,"Garcia-Ojalvo, Jordi/0000-0002-3716-7520; Liu, Jintao/0000-0002-6710-2605","Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad (Spain); FEDER [FIS2012-37655-C02-01]; ICREA Academia Programme; National Institutes of Health, National Institute of General Medical Sciences [R01 GM088428]; National Science Foundation [MCB-1450867 50867]; San Diego Center for Systems Biology (NIH) [P50 GM085764]","We would like to thank S.

Outflow ejection events probably vary in their velocity and/or in the rate of mass loss. Such 'episodic' ejection events(3) have been observed during the class 0 protostellar phase (the early accretion stage)(4-10), and continue during the subsequent class I phase that marks the first one million years of star formation(11-14). Previously observed episodic-ejection sources were relatively isolated; however, the most common sites of star formation are clusters(15). Outflows link protostars with their environment and provide a viable source of the turbulence that is necessary for regulating star formation in clusters(3), but it is not known how an accretion-driven jet or outflow in a clustered environment manifests itself in its earliest stage. This early stage is important in establishing the initial conditions for momentum and energy transfer to the environment as the protostar and cluster evolve. Here we report that an outflow from a young, class 0 protostar, at the hub of the very active and filamentary Serpens South protostellar cluster(16-18), shows unambiguous episodic events. The (CO)-C-12-O-16 (J = 2-1) emission from the protostar reveals 22 distinct features of outflow ejecta, the most recent having the highest velocity. The outflow forms bipolar lobes one of the first detectable signs of star formation which originate from the peak of 1-mm continuum emission. Emission from the surrounding (CO)-O-18 envelope shows kinematics consistent with rotation and an infall of material onto the protostar. The data suggest that episodic, accretion-driven outflow begins in the earliest phase of protostellar evolution, and that the outflow remains intact in a very clustered environment, probably providing efficient momentum transfer for driving turbulence.","[Plunkett, Adele L.; Arce, Hector G.; van Dokkum, Pieter] Yale Univ, Dept Astron, New Haven, CT 06511 USA; [Mardones, Diego] Univ Chile, Dept Astron, Santiago, Chile; [Dunham, Michael M.] Harvard Smithsonian Ctr Astrophys, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Fernandez-Lopez, Manuel] CCT La Plata CONICET, Inst Argentino Radioastron, RA-1894 Villa Elisa, Argentina; [Gallardo, Jose; Corder, Stuartt A.] Joint ALMA Observ, Santiago, Chile","Plunkett, AL (reprint author), Yale Univ, Dept Astron, New Haven, CT 06511 USA.",adele.plunkett@yale.edu; hectorarce@yale.edu,"Mardones, Diego/I-5719-2016","Plunkett, Adele/0000-0002-9912-5705",National Science Foundation (NSF) [DGE-1122492]; NSF [AST-0845619]; CONICYT [PFB-06]; Submillimeter Array,"A.L.P. is supported by a National Science Foundation (NSF) Graduate Research Fellowship under grant DGE-1122492; this research was made possible by the US Student Program of Fulbright Chile.

When two photons, which are bosonic particles, enter a beam-splitter with one photon in each input port, they bunch together at either of the two output ports. The corresponding disappearance of the coincidence count is the Hong-Ou-Mandel effect(1). Here we show the phonon counterpart of this effect in a system of trapped-ion phonons, which are collective excitations derived by quantizing vibrational motions that obey Bose-Einstein statistics. We realize a beam-splitter transformation of the phonons by employing the mutual Coulomb repulsion between ions, and perform a two-phonon quantum interference experiment using that transformation. We observe an almost perfect disappearance of the phonon coincidence between two ion sites, confirming that phonons can be considered indistinguishable bosonic particles. The two-particle interference demonstrated here is purely a quantum effect, without a classical counterpart, hence it should be possible to demonstrate the existence of entanglement on this basis. We attempt to generate an entangled state of phonons at the centre of the Hong-Ou-Mandel dip in the coincidence temporal profile, under the assumption that the entangled phonon state is successfully generated if the fidelity of the analysis pulses is taken into account adequately. Two-phonon interference, as demonstrated here, proves the bosonic nature of phonons in a trapped-ion system. It opens the way to establishing phonon modes as carriers of quantum information in their own right(2-4), and could have implications for the quantum simulation of bosonic particles(5,6) and analogue quantum computation via boson sampling(7).","[Toyoda, Kenji; Hiji, Ryoto; Noguchil, Atsushi; Urabe, Shinji] Osaka Univ, Grad Sch Engn Sci, Toyonaka, Osaka 5608531, Japan","Toyoda, K (reprint author), Osaka Univ, Grad Sch Engn Sci, 1-3 Machikaneyama, Toyonaka, Osaka 5608531, Japan.",toyoda@ee.es.osaka-u.ac.jp,,,JSPS KAKENHI [26400418],"We thank Y.

Redox-flow batteries (RFBs) were first built in the 1940s(2) and are considered a promising large-scale energy-storage technology(1,3,4). A limited number of redox-active materials(4,5-10)-mainly metal salts, corrosive halogens, and low-molar-mass organic compounds have been investigated as active materials, and only a few membrane materials(3,5,11-14), such as Nafion, have been considered for RFBs. However, for systems that are intended for both domestic and large-scale use, safety and cost must be taken into account as well as energy density and capacity, particularly regarding long-term access to metal resources, which places limits on the lithium-ion-based and vanadium-based RFB development(15,16). Here we describe an affordable, safe, and scalable battery system, which uses organic polymers as the charge-storage material in combination with inexpensive dialysis membranes, which separate the anode and the cathode by the retention of the non-metallic, active (macro-molecular) species, and an aqueous sodium chloride solution as the electrolyte. This water- and polymer-based RFB has an energy density of 10 watt hours per litre, current densities of up to 100 milliamperes per square centimetre, and stable long-term cycling capability. The polymer-based RFB we present uses an environmentally benign sodium chloride solution and cheap, commercially available filter membranes instead of highly corrosive acid electrolytes and expensive membrane materials.","[Janoschka, Tobias; Friebe, Christian; Morgenstern, Sabine; Hiller, Hannes; Hager, Martin D.; Schubert, Ulrich S.] Univ Jena, Lab Organ & Macromol Chem IOMC, D-07743 Jena, Germany; [Janoschka, Tobias; Friebe, Christian; Morgenstern, Sabine; Hiller, Hannes; Hager, Martin D.; Schubert, Ulrich S.] Univ Jena, CEEC Jena, D-07743 Jena, Germany; [Martin, Norbert; Martin, Udo] JenaBattenes GmbH, D-07743 Jena, Germany","Schubert, US (reprint author), Univ Jena, Lab Organ & Macromol Chem IOMC, D-07743 Jena, Germany.",ulrich.schubert@uni-jena.de,"Schubert, Ulrich/B-5777-2009; Friebe, Christian/F-5122-2010","Schubert, Ulrich/0000-0003-4978-4670; Hager, Martin D./0000-0002-6373-6600","European Regional Development Fund for Thuringia (EFRE); Thuringer Aufbaubank (TAB); Thuringian Ministry for Economic Affairs, Science and Digital Society (TMWWdG); Fonds der Chemischen Industrie","We acknowledge the European Regional Development Fund for Thuringia (EFRE), the Thuringer Aufbaubank (TAB), the Thuringian Ministry for Economic Affairs, Science and Digital Society (TMWWdG), and the Fonds der Chemischen Industrie for financial support.

But despite much progress(5-7,9-14), our understanding of the phenomena leading to such behaviour remains incomplete, which makes it challenging to rationally design surfaces that benefit from its manifestation(15-18). Here we show that water droplets resting on superhydrophobic textured surfaces in a low-pressure environment can self-remove through sudden spontaneous levitation and subsequent trampoline-like bouncing behaviour, in which sequential collisions with the surface accelerate the droplets. These collisions have restitution coefficients (ratios of relative speeds after and before collision) greater than unity(19) despite complete rigidity of the surface, and thus seemingly violate the second law of thermodynamics. However, these restitution coefficients result from an overpressure beneath the droplet produced by fast droplet vaporization while substrate adhesion and surface texture restrict vapour flow. We also show that the high vaporization rates experienced by the droplets and the associated cooling can result in freezing from a supercooled state(20,21) that triggers a sudden increase in vaporization, which in turn boosts the levitation process. This effect can spontaneously remove surface icing by lifting away icy drops the moment they freeze. Although these observations are relevant only to systems in a low-pressure environment, they show how surface texturing can produce droplet-surface interactions that prohibit liquid and freezing water-droplet retention on surfaces.","[Schutzius, Thomas M.; Jung, Stefan; Maitra, Tanmoy; Graeber, Gustav; Koehme, Moritz; Poulikakos, Dimos] ETH, Dept Mech & Proc Engn, Lab Thermodynam Emerging Technol, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland","Poulikakos, D (reprint author), ETH, Dept Mech & Proc Engn, Lab Thermodynam Emerging Technol, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland.",dpoulikakos@ethz.ch,"Schutzius, Thomas/A-1686-2011; poulikakos, dimos/O-2853-2014","Schutzius, Thomas/0000-0003-3309-3568; poulikakos, dimos/0000-0001-5733-6478",Marie Curie Actions for People COFUND programme [FEL-14 13-1]; Swiss National Science Foundation [200021_135479],"T.M.S. acknowledges the ETH Zurich Postdoctoral Fellowship Program and the Marie Curie Actions for People COFUND programme (FEL-14 13-1).

For this reason, difunctionalization reactions of alkenes (whereby two functional groups are added to the same double bond) are particularly important, as they can be used to produce highly complex molecular architectures(1,2). Stereoselective oxidation reactions, including dihydroxylation, aminohydroxylation and halogenation(3-6), are well established methods for functionalizing alkenes. However, the intermolecular incorporation of both carbon- and nitrogen-based functionalities stereoselectively across an alkene has not been reported. Here we describe the rhodium-catalysed carboamination of alkenes at the same (syn) face of a double bond, initiated by a carbon-hydrogen activation event that uses enoxyphthalimides as the source of both the carbon and the nitrogen functionalities. The reaction methodology allows for the intermolecular, stereospecific formation of one carbon-carbon and one carbon-nitrogen bond across an alkene, which is, to our knowledge, unprecedented. The reaction design involves the in situ generation of a bidentate directing group and the use of a new cyclopentadienyl ligand to control the reactivity of rhodium. The results provide a new way of synthesizing functionalized alkenes, and should lead to the convergent and stereoselective assembly of amine-containing acyclic molecules.","[Piou, Tiffany; Rovis, Tomislav] Colorado State Univ, Dept Chem, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA","Rovis, T (reprint author), Colorado State Univ, Dept Chem, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA.",rovis@colostate.edu,,,National Institute of General Medical Sciences [GM80442],"We thank the National Institute of General Medical Sciences (grant no.

Here we assess whether the type of genetic sex determination influences the ASR using data from 344 species in 117 families of tetrapods. We show that taxa with female heterogamety have a significantly more male-biased ASR (proportion of males: 0.55 +/- 0.01 (mean +/- s.e.m.)) than taxa with male heterogamety (0.43 +/- 0.01). The genetic sex-determination system explains 24% of interspecific variation in ASRs in amphibians and 36% in reptiles. We consider several genetic factors that could contribute to this pattern, including meiotic drive and sex-linked deleterious mutations, but further work is needed to quantify their effects. Regardless of the mechanism, the effects of the genetic sex-determination system on the adult sex ratio are likely to have profound effects on the demography and social behaviour of tetrapods.","[Pipoly, Ivett; Bokony, Veronika; Liker, Andras] Univ Pannonia, Dept Limnol, H-8201 Veszprem, Hungary; [Bokony, Veronika] Hungarian Acad Sci, Ctr Agr Res, Inst Plant Protect, Lendulet Evolutionary Ecol Res Grp, H-1022 Budapest, Hungary; [Kirkpatrick, Mark] Univ Texas Austin, Dept Integrat Biol, Austin, TX 78712 USA; [Donald, Paul F.] Royal Soc Protect Birds, RSPB Ctr Conservat Sci, Sandy SG19 2DL, Beds, England; [Donald, Paul F.] Univ Cambridge, Dept Zool, Conservat Sci Grp, Cambridge CB2 3EJ, England; [Szekely, Tomas] Univ Bath, Dept Biol & Biochem, Milner Ctr Evolut, Bath BA2 7AY, Avon, England","Liker, A (reprint author), Univ Pannonia, Dept Limnol, Pf 158, H-8201 Veszprem, Hungary.",aliker@almos.uni-pannon.hu,,,European Union [TAMOP-4.2.2.B-15/1/KONV-2015-0004]; US National Science Foundation [DEB-0819901]; Humboldt Award; MTA-DE 'Lendulet' grant; Hungarian Scientific Research Fund [OTKA K112838]; Marie Curie Intra-European Fellowship,"M.

Hence, it has been ranked by the World Health Organization as a top disorder of morbidity and lost productivity(2). Previous neuropathological studies have revealed a series of alterations in the brains of patients with bipolar disorder or animal models', such as reduced glial cell number in the prefrontal cortex of patients(4), upregulated activities of the protein kinase A and C pathways(5-7) and changes in neurotransmission(8-11). However, the roles and causation of these changes in bipolar disorder have been too complex to exactly determine the pathology of the disease. Furthermore, although some patients show remarkable improvement with lithium treatment for yet unknown reasons, others are refractory to lithium treatment. Therefore, developing an accurate and powerful biological model for bipolar disorder has been a challenge. The introduction of induced pluripotent stem-cell (iPSC) technology has provided a new approach. Here we have developed an iPSC model for human bipolar disorder and investigated the cellular phenotypes of hippocampal dentate gyrus-like neurons derived from iPSCs of patients with bipolar disorder. Guided by RNA sequencing expression profiling, we have detected mitochondrial abnormalities in young neurons from patients with bipolar disorder by using mitochondrial assays; in addition, using both patch-clamp recording and somatic Ca2+ imaging, we have observed hyperactive action-potential firing. This hyperexcitability phenotype of young neurons in bipolar disorder was selectively reversed by lithium treatment only in neurons derived from patients who also responded to lithium treatment. Therefore, hyperexcitability is one early endophenotype of bipolar disorder, and our model of iPSCs in this disease might be useful in developing new therapies and drugs aimed at its clinical treatment.","[Mertens, Jerome; Wang, Qiu-Wen; Yang, Bo; Zheng, Yi; Yao, Jun] Tsinghua Univ, Sch Life Sci, McGovern Inst Brain Res, State Key Lab Membrane Biol,Tsinghua Peking Joint, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China; [Mertens, Jerome; Kim, Yongsung; Yu, Diana X.; Pham, Son; Soltani, Sheila; Eames, Tameji; Schafer, Simon T.; Boyer, Leah; Marchetto, Maria C.; Gage, Fred H.; Yao, Jun] Salk Inst Biol Studies, Genet Lab, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; [Diffenderfer, Kenneth E.] Salk Inst Biol Studies, Stem Cell Core, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; [Zhang, Jian; Mi, Shuangli] Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing Inst Genom, Key Lab Genom & Precis Med, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Nurnberger, John I.] Indiana Univ, Dept Psychiat, Indianapolis, IN 46202 USA; [Calabrese, Joseph R.] Case Western Reserve Univ, Dept Psychiat, Cleveland, OH 44106 USA; [Odegaard, Ketil J.] Univ Bergen, Dept Psychiat, N-5020 Bergen, Norway; [McCarthy, Michael J.; Kelsoe, John R.] VA San Diego Healthcare Syst, Dept Psychiat, La Jolla, CA 92151 USA; [McCarthy, Michael J.; Nievergelt, Caroline M.; Kelsoe, John R.] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Psychiat, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Zandi, Peter P.] Johns Hopkins Univ, Dept Psychiat, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA; [Alba, Martin] Dalhousie Univ, Dept Psychiat, Halifax, NS B3H 2E2, Canada; [Brennand, Kristen J.] Mt Sinai Sch Med, Dept Psychiat, New York, NY 10029 USA; [Yao, Jun] Jiangsu Normal Univ, Jiangsu Collaborat Innovat Ctr Language Abil, Xuzhou 221009, Peoples R China","Yao, J (reprint author), Tsinghua Univ, Sch Life Sci, McGovern Inst Brain Res, State Key Lab Membrane Biol,Tsinghua Peking Joint, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China.",jkelsoe@ucsd.edu; gage@salk.edu; jyao@mail.tsinghua.edu.cn,"Mertens, Jerome/P-1931-2015; Brennand, Kristen/J-8704-2012; McCarthy, Michael/K-9302-2017","Mertens, Jerome/0000-0002-4291-4121; Brennand, Kristen/0000-0003-0993-5956; McCarthy, Michael/0000-0001-6219-4945; Yao, Jun/0000-0002-4916-3412; Boyer, Leah/0000-0002-0546-4344; Nurnberger, John/0000-0002-7674-1767; Nievergelt, Caroline/0000-0001-5766-8923","National Natural Science Foundation of China [31471020, 31161120358, 31123004]; National Basic Research Program of China [2015CB910603, 2011CB510106]; Key Laboratory of Genomic and Precision Medicine, Chinese Academy of Sciences; Engmann Foundation; JPB Foundation; Helmsley Trust; Mather's Foundation; Glenn Foundation for Aging Research; National Institute of Health [MH106056]; New York Stem Cell Foundation - Robertson Award; National Institute of Mental Health [U01 MH92758]; Department of Veterans Affairs [5I01CX000363]","We thank the patients who participated in this study.

Cancer cells of common origin manifest distinct gene expression patterns after metastasizing to different organs(2). Clearly, the dynamic interaction between metastatic tumour cells and extrinsic signals at individual metastatic organ sites critically effects the subsequent metastatic outgrowth(3,4). Yet, it is unclear when and how disseminated tumour cells acquire the essential traits from the microenvironment of metastatic organs that prime their subsequent outgrowth. Here we show that both human and mouse tumour cells with normal expression of PTEN, an important tumour suppressor, lose PTEN expression after dissemination to the brain, but not to other organs. The PTEN level in PTEN-loss brain metastatic tumour cells is restored after leaving the brain microenvironment. This brain microenvironment-dependent, reversible PTEN messenger RNA and protein downregulation is epigenetically regulated by microRNAs from brain astrocytes. Mechanistically, astrocyte-derived exosomes mediate an intercellular transfer of PTEN-targeting microRNAs to metastatic tumour cells, while astrocyte-specific depletion of PTEN-targeting microRNAs or blockade of astrocyte exosome secretion rescues the PTEN loss and suppresses brain metastasis in vivo. Furthermore, this adaptive PTEN loss in brain metastatic tumour cells leads to an increased secretion of the chemokine CCL2, which recruits IBA1-expressing myeloid cells that reciprocally enhance the outgrowth of brain metastatic tumour cells via enhanced proliferation and reduced apoptosis. Our findings demonstrate a remarkable plasticity of PTEN expression in metastatic tumour cells in response to different organ microenvironments, underpinning an essential role of co-evolution between the metastatic cells and their microenvironment during the adaptive metastatic outgrowth. Our findings signify the dynamic and reciprocal cross-talk between tumour cells and the metastatic niche; importantly, they provide new opportunities for effective anti-metastasis therapies, especially of consequence for brain metastasis patients.","[Zhang, Lin; Zhan, Siyuan; Yao, Jun; Lowery, Frank J.; Zhang, Qingling; Huang, Wen-Chien; Li, Ping; Li, Min; Wang, Xiao; Zhang, Chenyu; Wang, Hai; Ellis, Kenneth; Yu, Dihua] Univ Texas MD Anderson Canc Ctr, Dept Mol & Cellular Oncol, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Zhang, Lin; Lowery, Frank J.; Yu, Dihua] Univ Texas Houston, Hlth Sci Ctr, Grad Sch Biomed Sci, Canc Biol Program, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Zhan, Siyuan] Univ Notre Dame, Dept Biol Sci, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA; [Cheerathodi, Mujeeburahiman; McCarty, Joseph H.; Huang, Suyun] Univ Texas MD Anderson Canc Ctr, Dept Neurosurg, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Palmieri, Diane; Steeg, Patricia S.] NCI, Womans Malignancies Branch, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Saunus, Jodi; Lakhani, Sunil] Univ Queensland, Clin Res Ctr, Brisbane, Qld 4029, Australia; [Lakhani, Sunil] Sch Med & Pathol Queensland, Brisbane, Qld 4029, Australia; [Lakhani, Sunil] Royal Brisbane & Womens Hosp, Brisbane, Qld 4029, Australia; [Sahin, Aysegul A.; Aldape, Kenneth D.] Univ Texas MD Anderson Canc Ctr, Dept Pathol, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Yu, Dihua] China Med Univ, Ctr Mol Med, Taichung 40402, Taiwan","Yu, DH (reprint author), Univ Texas MD Anderson Canc Ctr, Dept Mol & Cellular Oncol, Houston, TX 77030 USA.",dyu@mdanderson.org,"Zhang, Siyuan/A-1276-2014","Zhang, Siyuan/0000-0003-0910-3666; Lowery, Frank/0000-0002-4620-5293",DOD Center of Excellence [W81XWH-06-2-0033]; NIH [5R00CA158066-05]; DOD [W81XWH-11-1-0003]; Isaiah Fidler Fellowship in Cancer [PO1-CA099031]; Susan G.

Although extensive studies have focused on autophagic turnover of cytoplasmic materials, little is known about the role of autophagy in degrading nuclear components. Here we report that the autophagy machinery mediates degradation of nuclear lamina components in mammals. The autophagy protein LC3/Atg8, which is involved in autophagy membrane trafficking and substrate delivery(4-6), is present in the nucleus and directly interacts with the nuclear lamina protein lamin B1, and binds to lamin-associated domains on chromatin. This LC3-lamin B1 interaction does not downregulate lamin B1 during starvation, but mediates its degradation upon oncogenic insults, such as by activated RAS. Lamin B1 degradation is achieved by nucleus-to-cytoplasm transport that delivers lamin B1 to the lysosome. Inhibiting autophagy or the LC3-lamin B1 interaction prevents activated RAS-induced lamin B1 loss and attenuates oncogene-induced senescence in primary human cells. Our study suggests that this new function of autophagy acts as a guarding mechanism protecting cells from tumorigenesis.","[Dou, Zhixun; Xu, Caiyue; Donahue, Greg; Zhu, Jiajun; Capelll, Brian C.; Drake, Adam M.; Shah, Parisha P.; Berger, Shelley L.] Univ Penn, Perelman Sch Med, Dept Cell & Dev Biol, Epigenet Program, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Shimi, Takeshi; Adam, Stephen A.; Goldman, Robert D.] Northwestern Univ, Feinberg Sch Med, Dept Cell & Mol Biol, Chicago, IL 60611 USA; [Pan, Ji-An; Catanzaro, Joseph M.; Zong, Wei-Xing] SUNY Stony Brook, Dept Mol Genet & Microbiol, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA; [Ivanov, Andrejs; Adams, Peter D.] Univ Glasgow, Inst Canc Sci, Glasgow G61 1BD, Lanark, Scotland; [Ivanov, Andrejs; Adams, Peter D.] Beatson Inst Canc Res, Glasgow G61 1BD, Lanark, Scotland; [Ricketts, M.

Together with single-guide RNAs3, Cas9 also functions as a powerful genome engineering tool in plants and animals(4-6), and efforts are underway to increase the efficiency and specificity of DNA targeting for potential therapeutic applicatione(7,8). Studies of off-target effects have shown that DNA binding is far more promiscuous than DNA cleavage(9-11), yet the molecular cues that govern strand scission have not been elucidated. Here we show that the conformational state of the HNH nuclease domain directly controls DNA cleavage activity. Using intramolecular Forster resonance energy transfer experiments to detect relative orientations of the Cas9 catalytic domains when associated with on- and off-target DNA, we find that DNA cleavage efficiencies scale with the extent to which the HNH domain samples an activated conformation. We furthermore uncover a surprising mode of allosteric communication that ensures concerted firing of both Cas9 nuclease domains. Our results highlight a proofreading mechanism beyond initial protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) recognition(12) and RNA-DNA base-pairing(3) that serves as a final specificity checkpoint before DNA double-strand break formation.","[Sternberg, Samuel H.; Doucina, Jennifer A.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Chem, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [LaFrance, Benjamin; Doucina, Jennifer A.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mol & Cell Biol, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Kaplan, Matias; Doucina, Jennifer A.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Doucina, Jennifer A.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Innovat Genom Initiat, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Doucina, Jennifer A.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Phys Biosci Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA","Doucina, JA (reprint author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Chem, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",doudna@berkeley.edu,,,National Science Foundation; National Defense Science & Engineering Graduate Research Fellowship programs; National Institutes of Health National Research Service Award Training Grant [T32GM007232],"We thank D.

In influenza virus, the polymerase (FluPol) is composed of three polypeptides: PB1, PB2 and PA/P3. PB1 houses the polymerase active site, whereas PB2 and PA/P3 contain, respectively, cap-binding and endonuclease domains required for transcription initiation by cap-snatching(2). Replication occurs through de novo initiation and involves a complementary RNA intermediate. Currently available structures of the influenza A and B virus polymerases include promoter RNA (the 5' and 3' termini of viral genome segments), showing FluPol in transcription pre-initiation states(3,4). Here we report the structure of apo-FluPol from an influenza C virus, solved by X-ray crystallography to 3.9 angstrom, revealing a new 'closed' conformation. The apo-FluPol forms a compact particle with PB1 at its centre, capped on one face by PB2 and clamped between the two globular domains of P3. Notably, this structure is radically different from those of promoter-bound FluPols(3,4). The endonudease domain of P3 and the domains within the carboxy-terminal two-thirds of PB2 are completely rearranged. The cap-binding site is occluded by PB2, resulting in a conformation that is incompatible with transcription initiation. Thus, our structure captures FluPol in a closed, transcription pre-activation state. This reveals the conformation of newly made apo-FluPol in an infected cell, but may also apply to FluPol in the context of a non-transcribing ribonucleoprotein complex. Comparison of the apo-FluPol structure with those of promoter-bound FluPols allows us to propose a mechanism for FluPol activation. Our study demonstrates the remarkable flexibility of influenza virus RNA polymerase, and aids our understanding of the mechanisms controlling transcription and genome replication.","[Hengrung, Narin; Martin, Itziar Serna; Vreede, Frank T.; Fodor, Ervin] Univ Oxford, Sir William Dunn Sch Pathol, Oxford OX1 3RE, England; [Hengrung, Narin; El Omari, Kamel; Stuart, David I.; Grimes, Jonathan M.] Univ Oxford, Div Struct Biol, Oxford OX3 7BN, England; [Cusack, Stephen] European Mol Biol Lab, Grenoble Outstn, F-38042 Grenoble 9, France; [Cusack, Stephen] Univ Grenoble Alpes, CNRS, EMBL Unit Virus Host Cell Interact, F-38042 Grenoble 9, France; [Rambo, Robert P.; Stuart, David I.; Grimes, Jonathan M.] Diamond Light Source Ltd, Didcot OX11 0DE, Oxon, England; [Vonrhein, Clemens; Bricogne, Gerard] Global Phasing Ltd, Cambridge CB3 0AX, England","Grimes, JM (reprint author), Univ Oxford, Div Struct Biol, Henry Wellcome Bldg Genom Med, Oxford OX3 7BN, England.",jonathan@strubi.ox.ac.uk; ervin.fodor@path.ox.ac.uk,,"El Omari, Kamel/0000-0003-3506-6045; Cusack, Stephen/0000-0002-9324-0796","Medical Research Council (MRC) [MR/K000241/1, G1100138, G1000099]; Wellcome Trust [092931/Z/10/Z, 075491/Z/04]; MRC","We thank N.

Ten-eleven translocation (TET) proteins are involved in DNA demethylation through iteratively oxidizing 5-methylcytosine (5mC) into 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC), 5-formylcytosine (5fC) and 5-carboxylcytosine (5caC)(4-8). Here we show that human TET1 and TET2 are more active on 5mC-DNA than 5hmC/5fC-DNA substrates. We determine the crystal structures of TET2-5hmC-DNA and TET2-5fC-DNA complexes at 1.80 angstrom and 1.97 angstrom resolution, respectively. The cytosine portion of 5hmC/5fC is specifically recognized by TET2 in a manner similar to that of 5mC in the TET2-5mC-DNA structure(9), and the pyrimidine base of 5mC/5hmC/5fC adopts an almost identical conformation within the catalytic cavity. However, the hydroxyl group of 5hmC and carbonyl group of 5fC face towards the opposite direction because the hydroxymethyl group of 5hmC and formyl group of 5fC adopt restrained conformations through forming hydrogen bonds with the 1-carboxylate of NOG and N4 exocyclic nitrogen of cytosine, respectively. Biochemical analyses indicate that the substrate preference of TET2 results from the different efficiencies of hydrogen abstraction in TET2-mediated oxidation. The restrained conformation of 5hmC and 5fC within the catalytic cavity may prevent their abstractable hydrogen(s) adopting a favourable orientation for hydrogen abstraction and thus result in low catalytic efficiency. Our studies demonstrate that the substrate preference of TET2 results from the intrinsic value of its substrates at their 5mC derivative groups and suggest that 5hmC is relatively stable and less prone to further oxidation by TET proteins. Therefore, TET proteins are evolutionarily tuned to be less reactive towards 5hmC and facilitate the generation of 5hmC as a potentially stable mark for regulatory functions.","[Hu, Lulu; Cheng, Jingdong; Rao, Qinhui; Li, Ze; Zhang, Lei; Li, Wei; Gong, Wei; Liu, Mengjie; Sun, Chang; Yin, Xiaotong; Li, Jie; Tan, Xiangshi; Yang, Pengyuan; Xu, Yanhui] Fudan Univ, Shanghai Med Coll, Inst Biomed Sci, Shanghai Canc Ctr, Shanghai 200032, Peoples R China; [Hu, Lulu; Cheng, Jingdong; Rao, Qinhui; Li, Ze; Zhang, Lei; Gong, Wei; Liu, Mengjie; Sun, Chang; Yin, Xiaotong; Li, Jie; Yang, Pengyuan; Xu, Yanhui] Fudan Univ, Shanghai Med Coll, Sch Basic Med Sci, Key Lab Mol Med,Minist Educ,Dept Syst Biol Med, Shanghai 200032, Peoples R China; [Hu, Lulu; Xu, Yanhui] Fudan Univ, Sch Life Sci, Collaborat Innovat Ctr Genet & Dev, State Key Lab Genet Engn, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China; [Lu, Junyan; Jiang, Hualiang; Luo, Cheng] Chinese Acad Sci, Shanghai Inst Mat Med, State Key Lab Drug Res, Drug Discovery & Design Ctr, Shanghai 201203, Peoples R China; [Hou, Haifeng] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst High Energy Phys, Beijing Synchrotron Radiat Facil, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China; [Lou, Zhiyong] Tsinghua Univ, Lab Struct Biol, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China; [Lou, Zhiyong] Tsinghua Univ, Sch Med, MOE Lab Prot Sci, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China; [Wang, Pengcheng; Wang, Yinsheng] Univ Calif Riverside, Dept Chem, Riverside, CA 92521 USA; [Fang, Dong; Cui, Qiang] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Chem, Theoret Chem Inst, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [He, Chuan] Univ Chicago, Dept Chem, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [He, Chuan] Univ Chicago, Inst Biophys Dynam, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [He, Chuan] Univ Chicago, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Chicago, IL 60637 USA","Xu, YH (reprint author), Fudan Univ, Shanghai Med Coll, Inst Biomed Sci, Shanghai Canc Ctr, Shanghai 200032, Peoples R China.",cluo@simm.ac.cn; xuyh@fudan.edu.cn,,"Sun, Chang/0000-0002-2080-5450; Lu, Junyan/0000-0002-9211-0746; Wang, Pengcheng/0000-0003-4581-983X","National Basic Research Program of China [2011CB965300]; National Science & Technology Major Project 'Key New Drug Creation and Manufacturing Program' of China [2014ZX09507-002]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [U1432242, 31425008, 91419301, 91313000, 31270779, 21210003]; Basic Research Project of Shanghai Science and Technology Commission [12JC1402700]; Program of Shanghai Subject Chief Scientist [14XD1400500]; Hi-Tech Research and Development Program of China [2012AA020302, 2012AA01A305]; Chinese Academy of Sciences [XDA01040305]","We thank the staff of beamlines BL17U and BL19U at Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility for assistance in data collection, and staff of the Biomedical Core Facility, Fudan University, for their help with mass spectrometry.

Here we report the discovery of a monosynaptic prefrontal cortex (predominantly anterior cingulate) to hippocampus (CA3 to CA1 region) projection in mice, and find that optogenetic manipulation of this projection (here termed AC-CA) is capable of eliciting contextual memory retrieval. To explore the network mechanisms of this process, we developed and applied tools to observe cellular-resolution neural activity in the hippocampus while stimulating AC-CA projections during memory retrieval in mice behaving in virtual-reality environments. Using this approach, we found that learning drives the emergence of a sparse class of neurons in CA2/CA3 that are highly correlated with the local network and that lead synchronous population activity events; these neurons are then preferentially recruited by the AC-CA projection during memory retrieval. These findings reveal a sparsely implemented memory retrieval mechanism in the hippocampus that operates via direct top-down prefrontal input, with implications for the patterning and storage of salient memory representations.","[Rajasethupathy, Priyamvada; Marshel, James H.; Kim, Christina K.; Ferenczi, Emily; Lee, Soo Yeun; Berndt, Andre; Ramakrishnan, Charu; Jaffe, Anna; Lo, Maisie; Liston, Conor; Deisseroth, Karl] Stanford Univ, Dept Bioengn, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Rajasethupathy, Priyamvada; Sankaran, Sethuraman; Deisseroth, Karl] Stanford Univ, CNC Program, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Kim, Christina K.; Ferenczi, Emily; Lee, Soo Yeun; Berndt, Andre] Stanford Univ, Neurosci Program, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Liston, Conor; Deisseroth, Karl] Stanford Univ, Dept Psychiat & Behav Sci, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Deisseroth, Karl] Stanford Univ, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Stanford, CA 94305 USA","Deisseroth, K (reprint author), Stanford Univ, Dept Bioengn, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",deissero@stanford.edu,"mohamady, mahin/G-2175-2016","Marshel, James/0000-0003-3517-8493; Kim, Christina/0000-0002-1466-7098","Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Neuro-FAST program; National Institute of Mental Health, National Science Foundation; National Institute on Drug Abuse, National Science Foundation; Simons Foundation; Tarlton Foundation; Wiegers Family Fund; Nancy and James Grosfeld Foundation; H.L.

Caspase-1 is activated by ligands of various canonical inflammasomes, and caspase-4, -5 and -11 directly recognize bacterial lipopolysaccharide, both of which trigger pyroptosis. Despite the crucial role in immunity and endotoxic shock, the mechanism for pyroptosis induction by inflammatory caspases is unknown. Here we identify gasdermin D (Gsdmd) by genome-wide clustered regularly interspaced palindromic repeat (CRISPR)-Cas9 nuclease screens of caspase-11- and caspase-1-mediated pyroptosis in mouse bone marrow macrophages. GSDMD-deficient cells resisted the induction of pyroptosis by cytosolic lipopolysaccharide and known canonical inflammasome ligands. Interleukin-1 beta release was also diminished in Gsdmd(-/-) cells, despite intact processing by caspase-1. Caspase-1 and caspase-4/5/11 specifically cleaved the linker between the amino-terminal gasdermin-N and carboxy-terminal gasdermin-C domains in GSDMD, which was required and sufficient for pyroptosis. The cleavage released the intramolecular inhibition on the gasdermin-N domain that showed intrinsic pyroptosis-inducing activity. Other gasdermin family members were not cleaved by inflammatory caspases but shared the autoinhibition; gain-of-function mutations in Gsdma3 that cause alopecia and skin defects disrupted the autoinhibition, allowing its gasdermin-N domain to trigger pyroptosis. These findings offer insight into inflammasome-mediated immunity/diseases and also change our understanding of pyroptosis and programmed necrosis.","[Shi, Jianjin] Tsinghua Univ, Peking Univ Tsinghua Univ Natl Inst Biol Sci Join, Sch Life Sci, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China; [Shi, Jianjin; Zhao, Yue; Wang, Kun; Shi, Xuyan; Wang, Yue; Huang, Huanwei; Zhuang, Yinghua; Cai, Tao; Wang, Fengchao; Shao, Feng] Natl Inst Biol Sci, Beijing 102206, Peoples R China; [Shao, Feng] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Biophys, Natl Lab Biomacromol, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Shao, Feng] Collaborat Innovat Ctr Canc Med, Natl Inst Biol Sci, Beijing 102206, Peoples R China","Shao, F (reprint author), Natl Inst Biol Sci, Beijing 102206, Peoples R China.",shaofeng@nibs.ac.cn,,"Shi, Jianjin/0000-0001-8048-5180","Chinese Academy of Sciences [XDB08020202]; China National Science Foundation Program for Distinguished Young Scholars [31225002]; Program for International Collaborations [31461143006]; National Basic Research Program of China 973 Program [2012CB518700, 2014CB849602]; Howard Hughes Medical Institute; Beijing Scholar Program","We thank J.

A forward genetic screen with ethyl-N-nitrosourea-mutagenized mice links Gsdmd to the intracellular lipopolysaccharide response. Macrophages from Gsdmd(-/-) mice generated by gene targeting also exhibit defective pyroptosis and interleukin-1 beta secretion induced by cytoplasmic lipopolysaccharide or Gram-negative bacteria. In addition, Gsdmd(-1-) mice are protected from a lethal dose of lipopolysaccharide.

In addition, cometary comas have been found to contain a rich array of other molecules, including sulfuric compounds and complex hydrocarbons. Molecular oxygen (O-2), however, despite its detection on other icy bodies such as the moons of Jupiter and Saturn(2,3), has remained undetected in cometary comas. Here we report in situ measurement of O-2 in the coma of comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, with local abundances ranging from one per cent to ten per cent relative to H2O and with a mean value of 3.80 +/- 0.85 per cent. Our observations indicate that the O-2/H2O ratio is isotropic in the coma and does not change systematically with heliocentric distance. This suggests that primordial O-2 was incorporated into the nucleus during the comet's formation, which is unexpected given the low upper limits from remote sensing observations'. Current Solar System formation models do not predict conditions that would allow this to occur.","[Bieler, A.; Combi, M.; Gombosi, T. I.; Hansen, K.

Numerous Bell inequality tests have been reported(3-13); however, all experiments reported so far required additional assumptions to obtain a contradiction with local realism, resulting in 'loopholes'(13-16). Here we report a Bell experiment that is free of any such additional assumption and thus directly tests the principles underlying Bell's inequality. We use an event-ready scheme(17-19) that enables the generation of robust entanglement between distant electron spins (estimated state fidelity of 0.92 +/- 0.03). Efficient spin read-out avoids the fair-sampling assumption (detection loophole(14,15)), while the use of fast random-basis selection and spin read-out combined with a spatial separation of 1.3 kilometres ensure the required locality conditions(13). We performed 245 trials that tested the CHSH-Bell inequality(20) S <= 2 and found S = 2.42 +/- 0.20 (where S quantifies the correlation between measurement outcomes). A null-hypothesis test yields a probability of at most P = 0.039 that a local-realist model for space-like separated sites could produce data with a violation at least as large as we observe, even when allowing for memory(16,21) in the devices. Our data hence imply statistically significant rejection of the local-realist null hypothesis. This conclusion may be further consolidated in future experiments; for instance, reaching a value of P = 0.001 would require approximately 700 trials for an observed S = 2.4. With improvements, our experiment could be used for testing less-conventional theories, and for implementing device-independent quantum-secure communication(22) and randomness certification(23,24).","[Hensen, B.; Bernien, H.; Dreau, A.

However, there are very few reports of using transition-metal-based reactions to modify complex biomolecules(3,4),, which is due to the need for stringent reaction conditions (for example, aqueous media, low temperature and mild pH) and the existence of multiple reactive functional groups found in biomolecules. Here we report that palladium(II) complexes can be used for efficient and highly selective cysteine conjugation (bioconjugation) reactions that are rapid and robust under a range of bio-compatible reaction conditions. The straightforward synthesis of the palladium reagents from diverse and easily accessible aryl halide and trifluoromethanesulfonate precursors makes the method highly practical, providing access to a large structural space for protein modification. The resulting aryl bioconjugates are stable towards acids, bases, oxidants and external thiol nucleo-philes. The broad utility of the bioconjugation platform was further corroborated by the synthesis of new classes of stapled peptides and antibody-drug conjugates. These palladium complexes show potential as benchtop reagents for diverse bioconjugation applications.","[Vinogradova, Ekaterina V.; Zhang, Chi; Spokoyny, Alexander M.; Pentelute, Bradley L.; Buchwald, Stephen L.] MIT, Dept Chem, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA","Pentelute, BL (reprint author), MIT, Dept Chem, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",blp@mit.edu; sbuchwal@mit.edu,,/0000-0001-9519-7456,"National Institutes of Health [GM-58160, GM-110535, 1F32GM101762]; MIT; Damon Runyon Cancer Research Foundation; Sontag Foundation; George Buchi Research Fellowship; Koch Graduate Fellowship in Cancer Research of MIT; NSF [CHE-9808061, CHE-0946721]","Financial support for this work was provided by the National Institutes of Health (GM-58160; GM-110535; postdoctoral fellowship for A.M.S., 1F32GM101762), the MIT start-up fund (B.L.P.), a Damon Runyon Cancer Research Foundation Award (B.L.P.) and the Sontag Foundation Distinguished Scientist Award (B.L.P.).

Such inputs lubricate the ice-bed interface, transiently speeding up the flow of ice(1,2). Greater melting results in faster ice motion during summer, but slower motion over the subsequent winter, owing to the evolution of an efficient drainage system that enables water to drain from regions of the ice-sheet bed that have a high basal water pressure(2,3). However, the impact of hydrodynamic coupling on ice motion over decadal timescales remains poorly constrained. Here we show that annual ice motion across an 8,000-km(2) land-terminating region of the west GIS margin, extending to 1,100 m above sea level, was 12% slower in 2007-14 compared with 198594, despite a 50% increase in surface meltwater production. Our findings suggest that, over these three decades, hydrodynamic coupling in this section of the ablation zone resulted in a net slow-down of ice motion (not a speed-up, as previously postulated(1)). Increases in meltwater production from projected climate warming may therefore further reduce the motion of land-terminating margins of the GIS. Our findings suggest that these sectors of the ice sheet are more resilient to the dynamic impacts of enhanced meltwater production than previously thought.","[Tedstone, Andrew J.; Nienow, Peter W.; Gourmelen, Noel; Dehecq, Amaury; Goldberg, Daniel] Univ Edinburgh, Sch Geosci, Edinburgh EH8 9XP, Midlothian, Scotland; [Dehecq, Amaury] Univ Savoie Mt Blanc, Polytech Annecy Chambery, LISTIC, F-74944 Annecy Le Vieux, France; [Hanna, Edward] Univ Sheffield, Dept Geog, Sheffield S10 2TN, S Yorkshire, England","Tedstone, AJ (reprint author), Univ Edinburgh, Sch Geosci, Edinburgh EH8 9XP, Midlothian, Scotland.",a.j.tedstone@ed.ac.uk,"Hanna, Edward/H-2219-2016","Hanna, Edward/0000-0002-8683-182X; Tedstone, Andrew/0000-0002-9211-451X","UK Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) [NE/152830X/1, NE/J500021/1]; Scottish Alliance for Geoscience, Environment and Society (SAGES) Postdoctoral/Early Career Researcher Exchange (PECRE) award; University of Edinburgh GeoSciences Moss scholarship; European Space Agency Dragon 3 [10302]; Centre National d'Etudes Spatiales","A.J.T. acknowledges UK Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) studentships NE/152830X/1 and NE/J500021/1, a Scottish Alliance for Geoscience, Environment and Society (SAGES) Postdoctoral/Early Career Researcher Exchange (PECRE) award, and a University of Edinburgh GeoSciences Moss scholarship.

Well-dated and well-preserved fossils older than similar to 45,000 years that can be unequivocally attributed to Homo sapiens are lacking(1-4). Here we present evidence from the newly excavated Fuyan Cave in Damian (southern China). This site has provided 47 human teeth dated to more than 80,000 years old, and with an inferred maximum age of 120,000 years. The morphological and metric assessment of this sample supports its unequivocal assignment to H. sapiens. The Daoxian sample is more derived than any other anatomically modern humans, resembling middle-to-late Late Pleistocene specimens and even contemporary humans. Our study shows that fully modern morphologies were present in southern China 30,000-70,000 years earlier than in the Levant and Europe(5-7). Our data fill a chronological and geographical gap that is relevant for understanding when H. sapiens first appeared in southern Asia. The Damian teeth also support the hypothesis that during the same period, southern China was inhabited by more derived populations than central and northern China. This evidence is important for the study of dispersal routes of modern humans.. Finally, our results are relevant to exploring the reasons for the relatively late entry of H. sapiens into Europe. Some studies have investigated how the competition with H. sapiens may have caused Neanderthals' extinction. (see ref. 8 and references therein). Notably, although fully modern humans were already present in southern China at least as early as 80,000 years ago, there is no evidence that they entered Europe before similar to 45,000 years ago. This could indicate that H. neanderthalensis was indeed an additional ecological barrier for modern humans, who could only enter Europe when the demise of Neanderthals had already started.","[Liu, Wu; Xing, Song; Tong, Hao-wen; Pei, Shu-wen; Wu, Xiu-jie] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Vertebrate Paleontol & Paleoanthropol, Key Lab Vertebrate Evolut & Human Origins, Beijing 100044, Peoples R China; [Martinon-Torres, Maria; Bermudez de Castro, Jose Maria] UCL Anthropol, London WC1H 0BW, England; [Martinon-Torres, Maria] Univ Burgos, Dept Ciencias Hist & Geog, Burgos 09001, Spain; [Martinon-Torres, Maria; Sier, Mark Jan; Bermudez de Castro, Jose Maria] Ctr Nacl Invest Evoluc Humana CENIEH, Burgos 09002, Spain; [Cai, Yan-jun] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Earth Environm, State Key Lab Loess & Quaternary Geol, Xian 710075, Peoples R China; [Sier, Mark Jan] Univ Utrecht, Fac Geosci, Dept Earth Sci, Paleomagnet Lab Ft Hoofddijk, NL-3584 CD Utrecht, Netherlands; [Sier, Mark Jan] Leiden Univ, Fac Archaeol, NL-2300 RA Leiden, Netherlands; [Wu, Xiao-hong] Peking Univ, Sch Archaeol & Museol, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China; [Edwards, R.

Roughly half of these tumours regress spontaneously or are cured by limited therapy. By contrast, high-risk neuroblastomas have an unfavourable clinical course despite intensive multimodal treatment, and their molecular basis has remained largely elusive(2-4). Here we have performed whole-genome sequencing of 56 neuroblastomas (high-risk, n = 39; low-risk, n = 17) and discovered recurrent genomic rearrangements affecting a chromosomal region at 5p15.33 proximal of the telomerase reverse transcriptase gene (TERT). These rearrangements occurred only in high-risk neuroblastomas (12/39, 31%) in a mutually exclusive fashion with MYCN amplifications and ATRX mutations, which are known genetic events in this tumour type(1,2,5). In an extended case series (n = 217), TERT rearrangements defined a subgroup of high-risk tumours with particularly poor outcome. Despite a large structural diversity of these rearrangements, they all induced massive transcriptional upregulation of TERT. In the remaining high-risk tumours, TERT expression was also elevated in MYCN-amplified tumours, whereas alternative lengthening of telomeres was present in neuroblastomas without TERT or MYCN alterations, suggesting that telomere lengthening represents a central mechanism defining this subtype. The 5p15.33 rearrangements juxtapose the TERT coding sequence to strong enhancer elements, resulting in massive chromatin remodelling and DNA methylation of the affected region. Supporting a functional role of TERT, neuroblastoma cell lines bearing rearrangements or amplified MYCN exhibited both upregulated TERT expression and enzymatic telomerase activity. In summary, our findings show that remodelling of the genomic context abrogates transcriptional silencing of TERT in high-risk neuroblastoma and places telomerase activation in the centre of transformation in a large fraction of these tumours.","[Peifer, Martin; Bosco, Graziella; Thomas, Roman K.] Univ Cologne, Ctr Integrated Oncol Cologne Bonn, Fac Med, Dept Translat Genom, D-50931 Cologne, Germany; [Peifer, Martin; Hertwig, Falk; Roels, Frederik; Kraemer, Andrea; Sand, Frederik; Ikram, Fakhera; Ackermann, Sandra; Nuernberg, Peter; Mariappan, Aruljothi; Fischer, Matthias] Univ Cologne, Ctr Mol Med Cologne CMMC, D-50931 Cologne, Germany; [Hertwig, Falk; Roels, Frederik; Kraemer, Andrea; Ikram, Fakhera; Ackermann, Sandra; Engesser, Anne; Kahlert, Yvonne; Theissen, Jessica; Volland, Ruth; Berthold, Frank; Hero, Barbara; Fischer, Matthias] Univ Cologne, Univ Childrens Hosp Cologne, Fac Med, Dept Pediat Oncol & Hematol, D-50937 Cologne, Germany; [Dreidax, Daniel; Gartlgruber, Moritz; Henrich, Kai-Oliver; Savelyeva, Larissa; Bell, Emma; Westermann, Frank] German Canc Res Ctr, Div Neuroblastoma Genom B087, D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany; [Menon, Roopika; Vogel, Wenzel; Perner, Sven] Univ Hosp Bonn, Ctr Integrated Oncol Cologne Bonn, Inst Pathol, Dept Prostate Canc Res, D-53127 Bonn, Germany; [Menon, Roopika; Heuckmann, Johannes M.; Heynck, Stefanie; Mariotti, Erika; Gloeckner, Christian] NEO New Oncol AG, D-51105 Cologne, Germany; [Roncaioli, Justin L.; O'Sullivan, Roderick J.] Univ Pittsburgh, Inst Canc, Hillman Canc Ctr, Dept Pharmacol & Chem Biol, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA; [Ikram, Fakhera; Altmueller, Janine; Nuernberg, Peter] Univ Cologne, Cologne Ctr Genom, D-50931 Cologne, Germany; [Schmidt, Rene] Univ Munster, Inst Biostat & Clin Res, D-48149 Munster, Germany; [Nuernberg, Peter] Univ Cologne, Cologne Excellence Cluster Cellular Stress Respon, D-50931 Cologne, Germany; [Thierry-Mieg, Jean; Thierry-Mieg, Danielle] Natl Lib Med, Natl Ctr Biotechnol Informat, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20894 USA; [Leuschner, Ivo] Univ Kiel, Dept Pathol, D-24118 Kiel, Germany; [Schweiger, Michal R.] Univ Cologne, Funct Epigen, D-50931 Cologne, Germany; [Watkins, Simon C.] Univ Pittsburgh, Ctr Biol Imaging, Dept Cell Biol, Pittsburgh, PA 15261 USA; [Shao, Chunxuan; Hoefer, Thomas] German Canc Res Ctr, Div Theoret Syst Biol, D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany; [Achter, Viktor; Lang, Ulrich] Univ Cologne, Comp Ctr, D-50931 Cologne, Germany; [Lang, Ulrich] Univ Cologne, Dept Informat, D-50931 Cologne, Germany; [Saadati, Maral] German Canc Res Ctr, Div Biostat, D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany; [Eggert, Angelika; Schulte, Johannes H.] Charite Univ Med Ctr Berlin, Dept Pediat Oncol & Hematol, D-10117 Berlin, Germany; [de Wilde, Bram] Univ Ghent, Ctr Med Genet, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium; [Peng, Zhiyu] BGI Shenzhen, Shenzhen 518083, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Zhao, Chen; Shi, Leming] Fudan Univ, Ctr Pharmacogen, State Key Lab Genet Engn, Shanghai 201203, Peoples R China; [Zhao, Chen; Shi, Leming] Fudan Univ, Fudan Zhangjiang Ctr Clin Genom, State Key Lab Genet Engn, Shanghai 201203, Peoples R China; [Zhao, Chen; Shi, Leming] Fudan Univ, Sch Pharm, MOE Key Lab Contemporary Anthropol, Shanghai 201203, Peoples R China; [Zhao, Chen; Shi, Leming] Fudan Univ, Sch Life Sci, Shanghai 201203, Peoples R China; [Ortmann, Monika; Buettner, Reinhard; Thomas, Roman K.] Univ Cologne, Dept Pathol, D-50937 Cologne, Germany; [Schramm, Alexander] Univ Childrens Hosp, Dept Pediat Oncol & Hematol, D-45147 Essen, Germany; [Schulte, Johannes H.] German Canc Consortium DKTK, D-10117 Berlin, Germany; [Schulte, Johannes H.] German Canc Res Ctr, D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany; [Herrmann, Carl] Heidelberg Univ, Inst Pharm & Mol Biotechnol, D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany; [Herrmann, Carl] Heidelberg Univ, Bioquant Ctr, D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany; [Herrmann, Carl] German Canc Res Ctr, Div Theoret Bioinformat, D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany; [Fischer, Matthias] Max Planck Inst Metab Res, D-50931 Cologne, Germany","Fischer, M (reprint author), Univ Cologne, Ctr Mol Med Cologne CMMC, D-50931 Cologne, Germany.",mpeifer@uni-koeln.de; frank.westermann@dkfz-heidelberg.de; roman.thomas@uni-koeln.de; matthias.fischer@uk-koeln.de,"Herrmann, Carl/H-5859-2011; Hofer, Thomas/G-5665-2013; Ikram, Fakhera/E-3162-2017; THIERRY-MIEG, Jean/F-1975-2017","Hofer, Thomas/0000-0003-3560-8780; THIERRY-MIEG, Jean/0000-0002-0396-6789; Hertwig, Falk/0000-0003-4784-6516","German Cancer Aid [110122]; German Ministry of Science and Education (BMBF) as part of the e:Med initiative [01ZX1303A, 01ZX1406, 01ZX1307D]; BMBF [0316076A]; European Union [259348]; Fordergesellschaft Kinderkrebs-Neuroblastom-Forschung e.V.; German-Israeli Helmholtz Research School in Cancer Biology; Volkswagenstiftung (Lichtenberg Program); Center for Molecular Medicine Cologne","We are indebted to the patients and their parents for making available the tumour specimens analysed in this study.

Given the well-established role of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) in executive function(1), its interactions with sensory cortical areas during attention have been hypothesized to control sensory selection(2-5). To test this idea and, more generally, dissect the circuits underlying sensory selection, we developed a cross-modal divided-attention task in mice that allowed genetic access to this cognitive process. By optogenetically perturbing PFC function in a temporally precise window, the ability of mice to select appropriately between conflicting visual and auditory stimuli was diminished. Equivalent sensory thalamocortical manipulations showed that behaviour was causally dependent on PFC interactions with the sensory thalamus, not sensory cortex. Consistent with this notion, we found neurons of the visual thalamic reticular nucleus (visTRN) to exhibit PFC-dependent changes in firing rate predictive of the modality selected. visTRN activity was causal to performance as confirmed by bidirectional optogenetic manipulations of this subnetwork. Using a combination of electrophysiology and intracellular chloride photometry, we demonstrated that visTRN dynamically controls visual thalamic gain through feedforward inhibition. Our experiments introduce a new subcortical model of sensory selection, in which the PFC biases thalamic reticular subnetworks to control thalamic sensory gain, selecting appropriate inputs for further processing.","[Wimmer, Ralf D.; Schmitt, L.

Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) diseases are the most common hereditary peripheral neuropathies, for which there are no effective therapies(2,3). A subtype of these diseases CMT type 2D (CMT2D)-is caused by dominant mutations in GARS, encoding the ubiquitously expressed enzyme glycyl-transfer RNA (tRNA) synthetase (GlyRS). Despite the broad requirement of GlyRS for protein biosynthesis in all cells, mutations in this gene cause a selective degeneration of peripheral axons, leading to deficits in distal motor function(4). How mutations in GlyRS (GlyRS(CMT2D)) are linked to motor neuron vulnerability has remained elusive. Here we report that GlyRS(CMT2D) acquires a neomorphic binding activity that directly antagonizes an essential signalling pathway for motor neuron survival. We find that CMT2D mutations alter the conformation of GlyRS, enabling GlyRS(CMT2D) to bind the neuropilin 1 (Nrpl) receptor. This aberrant interaction competitively interferes with the binding of the cognate ligand vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) to Nrpl. Genetic reduction of Nrpl in mice worsens CMT2D symptoms, whereas enhanced expression of VEGF improves motor function. These findings link the selective pathology of CMT2D to the neomorphic binding activity of GlyRS(CMT2D) that antagonizes the VEGF-Nrp1 interaction, and indicate that the VEGF-Nrp1 signalling axis is an actionable target for treating CMT2D.","[He, Weiwei; Zhou, Huihao; Wei, Na; Shi, Yi; Dumitru, Calin Dan; Yang, Xiang-Lei] Scripps Res Inst, Dept Physiol Chem, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; [He, Weiwei; Zhou, Huihao; Wei, Na; Shi, Yi; Dumitru, Calin Dan; Yang, Xiang-Lei] Scripps Res Inst, Dept Cell & Mol Biol, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; [Bai, Ge; White, Nicholas M.; Lettieri, Karen; Pfaff, Samuel L.] Salk Inst Biol Studies, Howard Hughes Med Inst, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; [Bai, Ge; White, Nicholas M.; Lettieri, Karen; Pfaff, Samuel L.] Salk Inst Biol Studies, Gene Express Lab, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; [Lauer, Janelle; Griffin, Patrick R.] Scripps Res Inst, Dept Mol Therapeut, Jupiter, FL 33458 USA; [Liu, Huaqing; Shubayev, Veronica] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Anesthesiol, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Jordanova, Albena] Univ Antwerp, Mol Neurogen Grp, VIB Dept Mol Genet, BE-2610 Antwerp, Belgium; [Guergueltcheva, Velina] Med Univ Sofia, Dept Neurol, Sofia 1431, Bulgaria; [Burgess, Robert W.] Jackson Lab, Bar Harbor, ME 04609 USA","Yang, XL (reprint author), Scripps Res Inst, Dept Physiol Chem, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA.",pfaff@salk.edu; xlyang@scripps.edu,"ZHOU, HUIHAO/L-6133-2016","Burgess, Robert/0000-0002-9229-3407","National Foundation for Cancer Research; Pioneer fund; Howard Hughes Medical Institute; US National Institutes of Health [R01GM088278, R21NS084254, R01NS054154]; Marshall Heritage Foundation; Sol Goldman Trust; aTyr Pharma through Scripps Research Institute","We thank P.

However, the mechanisms underlying ISC regeneration after injury remain poorly understood. The Hippo signalling pathway mediates tissue growth and is important for regeneration(2,3). Here we demonstrate in mice that Yap, a downstream transcriptional effector of Hippo, is critical for recovery of intestinal epithelium after exposure to ionizing radiation. Yap transiently reprograms Lgr5(+) ISCs by suppressing Wnt signalling and excessive Paneth cell differentiation, while promoting cell survival and inducing a regenerative program that includes Egf pathway activation. Accordingly, growth of Yap-deficient organoids is rescued by the Egfr ligand epiregulin, and we find that non-cell-autonomous production of stromal epiregulin may compensate for Yap loss in vivo. Consistent with key roles for regenerative signalling in tumorigenesis, we further demonstrate that Yap inactivation abolishes adenomas in the Apc(Min) mouse model of colon cancer, and that Yap-driven expansion of Apc(-/-) organoids requires the Egfr module of the Yap regenerative program. Finally, we show that in vivo Yap is required for progression of early Apc mutant tumour-initiating cells, suppresses their differentiation into Paneth cells, and induces a regenerative program and Egfr signalling. Our studies reveal that upon tissue injury, Yap reprograms Lgr5(+) ISCs by inhibiting the Wnt homeostatic program, while inducing a regenerative program that includes activation of Egfr signalling. Moreover, our findings reveal a key role for the Yap regenerative pathway in driving cancer initiation.","[Gregorieff, Alex; Liu, Yu; Inanlou, Mohammad R.; Khomchuk, Yuliya; Wrana, Jeffrey L.] Mt Sinai Hosp, Ctr Syst Biol, Lunenfeld Tanenbaum Res Inst, Toronto, ON M5G 1X5, Canada; [Liu, Yu; Wrana, Jeffrey L.] Univ Toronto, Dept Mol Genet, Toronto, ON M5S 1A8, Canada","Wrana, JL (reprint author), Mt Sinai Hosp, Ctr Syst Biol, Lunenfeld Tanenbaum Res Inst, Toronto, ON M5G 1X5, Canada.",wrana@lunenfeld.ca,"Wrana, Jeffrey/F-8857-2013",,"CIHR [MOP-12860, MOP-106672]; Terry Fox Research Institute; Krembil Foundation","We would like to thank K.

Systemic infections with multidrug-resistant enterococci occur subsequent to gastrointestinal colonization(2). Preventing colonization by multidrug-resistant E. faecalis could therefore be a valuable approach towards limiting infection. However, little is known about the mechanisms E. faecalis uses to colonize and compete for stable gastrointestinal niches. Pheromone-responsive conjugative plasmids encoding bacteriocins are common among enterococcal strains(3) and could modulate niche competition among enterococci or between enterococci and the intestinal microbiota. We developed a model of colonization of the mouse gut with E. faecalis, without disrupting the microbiota, to evaluate the role of the conjugative plasmid pPD1 expressing baderiocin 21 (ref. 4) in enterococcal colonization. Here we show that E. faecalis harbouring pPD1 replaces indigenous enterococci and outcompetes E. faecalis lacking pPD1. Furthermore, in the intestine, pPD1 is transferred to other E. faecalis strains by conjugation, enhancing their survival. Colonization with an E. faecalis strain carrying a conjugation-defective pPD1 mutant subsequently resulted in clearance of vancomycin-resistant enterococci, without plasmid transfer. Therefore, bacteriocin expression by commensal bacteria can influence niche competition in the gastrointestinal tract, and bacteriocins, delivered by commensals that occupy a precise intestinal bacterial niche, may be an effective therapeutic approach to specifically eliminate intestinal colonization by multidrug-resistant bacteria, without profound disruption of the indigenous microbiota.","[Kommineni, Sushma; Lam, Vy; Chakraborty, Rajrupa; Hayward, Michael; Bousounis, Pavlos; Salzman, Nita H.] Med Coll Wisconsin, Div Gastroenterol, Dept Pediat, Milwaukee, WI 53226 USA; [Simpson, Pippa; Cao, Yumei] Med Coll Wisconsin, Div Quantitat Hlth Sci, Dept Pediat, Milwaukee, WI 53226 USA; [Kommineni, Sushma; Bretl, Daniel J.; Chakraborty, Rajrupa; Kristich, Christopher J.; Salzman, Nita H.] Med Coll Wisconsin, Dept Microbiol & Mol Genet, Milwaukee, WI 53226 USA","Salzman, NH (reprint author), Med Coll Wisconsin, Div Gastroenterol, Dept Pediat, Milwaukee, WI 53226 USA.",ckristich@mcw.edu; nsalzman@mcw.edu,,"Salzman, Nita/0000-0003-0939-6139","National Institutes of Health [AI057757, AI097619, GM099526, AI081692, 0D006447]","We thank I.

Saccharomyces cerevisiae ACC (ScACC) is crucial for the production of very-long-chain fatty acids and the maintenance of the nuclear envelope(7,8). ACC contains biotin carboxylase (BC) and carboxyltransferase (CT) activities, and its biotin is linked covalently to the biotin carboxyl carrier protein (BCCP). Most eukaryotic ACCs are 250-kilodalton (kDa), multi-domain enzymes and function as homodimers and higher oligomers. They contain a unique, 80-kDa central region that shares no homology with other proteins. Although the structures of the BC, CT and BCCP domains and other biotin-dependent carboxylase holoenzymes are known(1,9-14), there is currently no structural information on the ACC holoenzyme. Here we report the crystal structure of the full-length, 500-kDa holoenzyme dimer of ScACC. The structure is remarkably different from that of the other biotin-dependent carboxylases. The central region contains five domains and is important for positioning the BC and CT domains for catalysis. The structure unexpectedly reveals a dimer of the BC domain and extensive conformational differences compared to the structure of the BC domain alone, which is a monomer. These structural changes reveal why the BC domain alone is catalytically inactive and define the molecular mechanism for the inhibition of eukaryotic ACC by the natural product soraphen A(15,16) and by phosphorylation of a Ser residue just before the BC domain core in mammalian ACC. The BC and CT active sites are separated by 80 angstrom, and the entire BCCP domain must translocate during catalysis.","[Wei, Jia; Tong, Liang] Columbia Univ, Dept Biol Sci, New York, NY 10027 USA","Tong, L (reprint author), Columbia Univ, Dept Biol Sci, New York, NY 10027 USA.",ltong@columbia.edu,,"Wei, Jia/0000-0002-7301-3297; Tong, Liang/0000-0002-0563-6468","NIH [S100D012018, R01DK067238]","We thank M.

Here we describe a comprehensive evaluation of the genomic landscape of 452 CLL cases and 54 patients with monoclonal B-lymphocytosis, a precursor disorder. We extend the number of CLL driver alterations, including changes in ZNF292, ZMYM3, ARID1A and PTPN11. We also identify novel recurrent mutations in non-coding regions, including the 39 region of NOTCH1, which cause aberrant splicing events, increase NOTCH1 activity and result in a more aggressive disease. In addition, mutations in an enhancer located on chromosome 9p13 result in reduced expression of the B-cell-specific transcription factor PAX5. The accumulative number of driver alterations (0 to >= 4) discriminated between patients with differences in clinical behaviour. This study provides an integrated portrait of the CLL genomic landscape, identifies new recurrent driver mutations of the disease, and suggests clinical interventions that may improve the management of this neoplasia.","[Puente, Xose S.; Valdes-Mas, Rafael; Gutierrez-Abril, Jesus; Puente, Diana A.; Quesada, Victor; Lopez-Otin, Carlos] Univ Oviedo, Inst Univ Oncol IUOPA, Dept Bioquim & Biol Mol, E-33006 Oviedo, Spain; [Bea, Silvia; Beekman, Renee; Castellano, Giancarlo; Clot, Guillem; Martin-Garcia, David; Navarro, Alba; Royo, Cristina; Russinol, Nuria; Salaverria, Itziar] IDIBAPS, Barcelona 08036, Spain; [Villamor, Neus; Aymerich, Marta; Carrio, Anna; Colomer, Dolors; Costa, Dolors; Gonzalez, Blanca; Lopez-Guerra, Monica; Rozman, Maria; Campo, Elias] Univ Barcelona, IDIBAPS, Hosp Clin, Unitat Hematol, E-08036 Barcelona, Spain; [Martin-Subero, Jose I.; Queiros, Ana C.] Univ Barcelona, Dept Anat Patol Microbiol & Farmacol, E-08036 Barcelona, Spain; [Munar, Marta; Gelpi, Josep L.; Gonzalez, Santiago; Orozco, Modesto; Royo, Romina; Torrents, David] Univ Barcelona, Spanish Natl Bioinformat Inst, Programa Conjunto Biol Computac, BSC,IRB, E-08028 Barcelona, Spain; [Rubio-Perez, Carlota; Tamborero, David; Lopez-Bigas, Nuria] Univ Pompeu Fabra, Dept Expt & Hlth Sci, Res Unit Biomed Informat, Barcelona 08003, Spain; [Jares, Pedro; Enjuanes, Anna; Pinyol, Magda] IDIBAPS, Unidad Genom, Barcelona 08036, Spain; [Baumann, Tycho; Delgado, Julio; Lopez-Guillermo, Armando] IDIBAPS, Hosp Clin, Serv Hematol, Barcelona 08036, Spain; [Belver, Laura; Ferrando, Adolfo A.] Columbia Univ, Inst Canc Genet, New York, NY 10032 USA; [Colado, Enrique; Payer, Angel R.] Hosp Univ Cent Asturias, Serv Hematol, Oviedo 33011, Spain; [Estivill, Xavier] Pompeu Fabra Univ, Hosp Mar Res Inst IMIM, CRG, Barcelona 08003, Spain; [Gonzalez, Marcos; Hernandez-Rivas, Jesus M.] Univ Salamanca, Hosp Univ Salamanca, Ctr Invest Canc, Serv Hematol,IBSAL,CSIC, Salamanca 37007, Spain; [Gut, Marta; Gut, Ivo] Ctr Nacl Anal Genom, Barcelona 08028, Spain; [Nicolas, Pilar; Romeo-Casabona, Carlos M.] Univ Basque Country, Univ Deusto, Catedra Interuniv Derecho & Genoma Humano, Bilbao 48007, Spain; [Pisano, David G.; Valencia, Alfonso] Spanish Natl Bioinformat Inst, Spanish Natl Canc Res Ctr CNIO, Struct Biol & Biocomp Programme, Madrid 28029, Spain; [Stamatopoulos, Kostas] Ctr Res & Technol Hellas, Inst Appl Biosci, Thessaloniki 57001, Greece; [Stunnenberg, Hendrik G.] Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Nijmegen Ctr Mol Life Sci, Fac Sci, Dept Mol Biol, NL-6500 HB Nijmegen, Netherlands; [Terol, Maria J.] Hosp Clin Valencia, Serv Hematol, Valencia 46010, Spain","Lopez-Otin, C (reprint author), Univ Oviedo, Inst Univ Oncol IUOPA, Dept Bioquim & Biol Mol, E-33006 Oviedo, Spain.",clo@uniovi.es; ecampo@clinic.ub.es,"Quesada, Victor/B-6557-2014; Estivill, Xavier/A-3125-2013; Delgado, Julio/D-4891-2013; Valencia, Alfonso/I-3127-2015; Lopez-Otin, Carlos/C-6657-2013; Campo, elias/O-7192-2016; Gasull, Martina/A-6630-2013; Hernandez-Rivas, Jesus Maria/B-5459-2017; Lopez-Bigas, Nuria/F-6193-2011; Pisano, David/N-5817-2014","Quesada, Victor/0000-0002-8398-3457; Estivill, Xavier/0000-0002-0723-2256; Delgado, Julio/0000-0002-5157-4376; Valencia, Alfonso/0000-0002-8937-6789; Lopez-Otin, Carlos/0000-0001-6964-1904; Campo, elias/0000-0001-9850-9793; Hernandez-Rivas, Jesus Maria/0000-0002-9661-9371; Lopez-Bigas, Nuria/0000-0003-4925-8988; Castellano, Giancarlo/0000-0002-5715-7733; Colado, Enrique/0000-0001-8675-8207; Pisano, David/0000-0002-4895-4124; Torrents, David/0000-0002-6086-9037; Rozman, Maria/0000-0002-2641-1110; Beekman, Renee/0000-0001-7081-7874; Gonzalez Diaz, Marcos/0000-0001-6637-1072; Royo, Romina/0000-0003-3493-0874; COLOMER, DOLORS/0000-0001-7486-8484; Martin-Subero, Jose Ignacio/0000-0001-8809-5195; Gelpi, Josep Lluis/0000-0002-0566-7723; Navarro, Alba/0000-0002-4041-0974; Martin Garcia, David/0000-0002-0289-5915; Bea, Silvia/0000-0001-7192-2385; Gonzalez Rosado, Santiago/0000-0001-5685-4580",Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness through the Instituto de Salud Carlos III (ISCIII); Red Tematica de Investigacion del Cancer (RTICC); Banco Santander through its Santander Universities Global Division,"This work was funded by Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness through the Instituto de Salud Carlos III (ISCIII) and Red Tematica de Investigacion del Cancer (RTICC).

Consortia of methane-oxidizing archaea and sulphate-reducing bacteria are a well-known environmental example of microbial co-aggregation; however, the coupling mechanisms between these paired organisms is not well understood, despite the attention given them because of the global significance of anaerobic methane oxidation. Here we examined the influence of interspecies spatial positioning as it relates to biosynthetic activity within structurally diverse uncultured methane-oxidizing consortia by measuring stable isotope incorporation for individual archaeal and bacterial cells to constrain their potential metabolic interactions. In contrast to conventional models of syntrophy based on the passage of molecular intermediates, cellular activities were found to be independent of both species intermixing and distance between syntrophic partners within consortia. A generalized model of electric conductivity between co-associated archaea and bacteria best fit the empirical data. Combined with the detection of large multi-haem cytochromes in the genomes of methanotrophic archaea and the demonstration of redox-dependent staining of the matrix between cells in consortia, these results provide evidence for syntrophic coupling through direct electron transfer.","[McGlynn, Shawn E.; Chadwick, Grayson L.; Orphan, Victoria J.] CALTECH, Div Geol & Planetary Sci, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA; [Kempes, Christopher P.] NASA, Ames Res Ctr, Exobiol Branch, Moffett Field, CA 94035 USA; [Kempes, Christopher P.] CALTECH, Control & Dynam Syst, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA; [Kempes, Christopher P.] SETI Inst, Mountain View, CA 94034 USA","Orphan, VJ (reprint author), CALTECH, Div Geol & Planetary Sci, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA.",vorphan@gps.caltech.edu,,"Chadwick, Grayson/0000-0003-0700-9350; Orphan, Victoria/0000-0002-5374-6178","US Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Biological Environmental Research [DE-SC0004949, DE-SC0010574]; Gordon and Betty Moore foundation Marine Microbiology Initiative [3780]; DOE-BER [DE-SC0003940]; Agouron Geobiology Option post-doctoral fellowship in the Division of Geological and Planetary Sciences at Caltech; NASA Astrobiology Institute [NNA13AA92A]","We are grateful for the use of the facilities of the Beckman Resource Center for Transmission Electron Microscopy at Caltech (BRCem) and advice provided by A.

These structures provide visualizations of how adenosylcobalamin mediates CarH tetramer formation in the dark, how this tetramer binds to the promoter 235 element to repress transcription, and how light exposure leads to a large-scale conformational change that activates transcription. In addition to the remarkable functional repurposing of adenosylcobalamin from an enzyme cofactor to a light sensor, we find that nature also repurposed two independent protein modules in assembling CarH. These results expand the biological role of vitamin B-12 and provide fundamental insight into a new mode of light-dependent gene regulation.","[Jost, Marco; Chen, Percival Yang-Ting; Kang, Gyunghoon; Drennan, Catherine L.] MIT, Dept Chem, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Drennan, Catherine L.] MIT, Dept Biol, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Drennan, Catherine L.] MIT, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Fernandez-Zapata, Jesus; Padmanabhan, S.] CSIC, Inst Quim Fis Rocasolano, Madrid 28006, Spain; [Carmen Polanco, Maria; Manuel Ortiz-Guerrero, Juan; Elias-Arnanz, Montserrat] Univ Murcia, Fac Biol, Inst Quim Fis Rocasolano,CSIC, Dept Genet & Microbiol,Area Genet,Unidad Asociada, E-30100 Murcia, Spain","Padmanabhan, S (reprint author), CSIC, Inst Quim Fis Rocasolano, Madrid 28006, Spain.",padhu@iqfr.csic.es; melias@um.es; cdrennan@mit.edu,,"Elias-Arnanz, Montserrat/0000-0003-1980-3092; Padmanabhan, S./0000-0002-8772-0152","National Institutes of Health (NIH) [GM069857]; Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad, Spain [BFU2012-40184-C02-01]; FEDER (Fondo Europeo de Desarrollo Regional) [BFU2012-40184-C02-02]; CSIC-JAE- Predoc (Spain) fellowship; MIT Poitras pre-doctoral fellowship; National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) [P41GM103403]; NIH; US Department of Energy Office of Science User Facility [DE-AC02-06CH11357]; US Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences [DE-AC02-76SF00515]; Department of Energy Office of Biological and Environmental Research; NIGMS [P41GM103393]","We thank F.

These extreme events are discovered via bright X-ray(1-4) and optical/ultraviolet(5,6) flares in galactic centres. Prior studies based on modelling decaying flux trends have been able to estimate broad properties, such as the mass accretion rate(6,7). Here we report the detection of flows of hot, ionized gas in high-resolution X-ray spectra of a nearby tidal disruption event, ASASSN-14li in the galaxy PGC043234. Variability within the absorption-dominated spectra indicates that the gas is relatively close to the black hole. Narrow linewidths indicate that the gas does not stretch over a large range of radii, giving a low volume filling factor. Modest outflow speeds of a few hundred kilometres per second are observed; these are below the escape speed from the radius set by variability. The gas flow is consistent with a rotating wind from the inner, super-Eddington region of a nascent accretion disk, or with a filament of disrupted stellar gas near to the apocentre of an elliptical orbit. Flows of this sort are predicted by fundamental analytical theory(8) and more recent numerical simulations(7,9-14).","[Miller, Jon M.; Reynolds, Mark T.; Gultekin, Kayhan] Univ Michigan, Dept Astron, Ann Arbor, MI 48103 USA; [Kaastra, Jelle S.; de Plaa, Jelle] SRON Netherlands Inst Space Res, NL-3584 CA Utrecht, Netherlands; [Kaastra, Jelle S.] Univ Utrecht, Dept Phys & Astron, NL-3508 TA Utrecht, Netherlands; [Kaastra, Jelle S.] Leiden Univ, Leiden Observ, NL-2300 RA Leiden, Netherlands; [Miller, M.

Between one-quarter and one-half of white dwarfs have elements heavier than helium in their atmospheres(1,2), even though these elements ought to sink rapidly into the stellar interiors (unless they are occasionally replenished) (3-5). The abundance ratios of heavy elements in the atmospheres of white dwarfs are similar to the ratios in rocky bodies in the Solar System(6,7). This fact, together with the existence of warm, dusty debris disks(8-13) surrounding about four per cent of white dwarfs(14-16), suggests that rocky debris from the planetary systems of white-dwarf progenitors occasionally pollutes the atmospheres of the stars(17). The total accreted mass of this debris is sometimes comparable to the mass of large asteroids in the Solar System(1). However, rocky, disintegrating bodies around a white dwarf have not yet been observed. Here we report observations of a white dwarf-WD 1145+017-being transited by at least one, and probably several, disintegrating planetesimals, with periods ranging from 4.5 hours to 4.9 hours. The strongest transit signals occur every 4.5 hours and exhibit varying depths (blocking up to 40 per cent of the star's brightness) and asymmetric profiles, indicative of a small object with a cometary tail of dusty effluent material. The star has a dusty debris disk, and the star's spectrum shows prominent lines from heavy elements such as magnesium, aluminium, silicon, calcium, iron, and nickel. This system provides further evidence that the pollution of white dwarfs by heavy elements might originate from disrupted rocky bodies such as asteroids and minor planets.","[Vanderburg, Andrew; Johnson, John Asher; Bieryla, Allyson; Irwin, Jonathan; Lewis, John Arban; Kipping, David; Brown, Warren R.; Angus, Ruth; Schaefer, Laura; Latham, David W.; Charbonneau, David; Eastman, Jason] Harvard Smithsonian Ctr Astrophys, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Rappaport, Saul] MIT, Dept Phys, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Rappaport, Saul] MIT, Kavli Inst Astrophys & Space Res, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Kipping, David] Columbia Univ, Dept Astron, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Dufour, Patrick] Univ Montreal, Dept Phys, Inst Rech Exoplanetes, Montreal, PQ H3C 3J7, Canada; [Ciardi, David R.; Beichman, Charles] CALTECH, NASA, Exoplanet Sci Inst, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA; [Angus, Ruth] Univ Oxford, Dept Phys, Oxford OX1 3RH, England; [McCrady, Nate] Univ Montana, Dept Phys & Astron, Missoula, MT 59812 USA; [Wittenmyer, Robert A.] Univ New S Wales, Sch Phys, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia; [Wittenmyer, Robert A.] Univ New S Wales, Australian Ctr Astrobiol, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia; [Wright, Jason T.] Penn State Univ, Dept Astron & Astrophys, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Wright, Jason T.] Penn State Univ, Ctr Exoplanets & Habitable Worlds, University Pk, PA 16802 USA","Vanderburg, A (reprint author), Harvard Smithsonian Ctr Astrophys, 60 Garden St, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",avanderburg@cfa.harvard.edu,,"Lewis, John/0000-0001-5199-3522; Wright, Jason/0000-0001-6160-5888; Schaefer, Laura/0000-0003-2915-5025; Ciardi, David/0000-0002-5741-3047","National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship [DGE 1144152]; David and Lucile Packard Foundation; Alfred P.

At moderate flow speeds, turbulence is confined to localized patches; it is only at higher speeds that the entire flow becomes turbulent. The origin of the different states encountered during this transition, the front dynamics of the turbulent regions and the transformation to full turbulence have yet to be explained. By combining experiments, theory and computer simulations, here we uncover a bifurcation scenario that explains the transformation to fully turbulent pipe flow and describe the front dynamics of the different states encountered in the process. Key to resolving this problem is the interpretation of the flow as a bistable system with nonlinear propagation (advection) of turbulent fronts. These findings bridge the gap between our understanding of the onset of turbulence(7) and fully turbulent flows(8,9).","[Barkley, Dwight] Univ Warwick, Inst Math, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England; [Song, Baofang; Mukund, Vasudevan; Lemoult, Gregoire; Hof, Bjoern] IST Austria, A-3400 Klosterneuburg, Austria; [Song, Baofang] Max Planck Inst Dynam & Self Org, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany; [Song, Baofang] Univ Erlangen Nurnberg, Inst Multiscale Simulat, D-91052 Erlangen, Germany; [Avila, Marc] Univ Erlangen Nurnberg, Inst Fluid Mech, D-91058 Erlangen, Germany","Barkley, D (reprint author), Univ Warwick, Inst Math, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England.",D.Barkley@warwick.ac.uk; bhof@ist.ac.at,"Barkley, Dwight/F-8218-2014; Avila, Marc/A-1263-2009","Barkley, Dwight/0000-0003-4317-3705; Avila, Marc/0000-0001-5988-1090",Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft [FOR 1182]; European Research Council under the European Union [306589]; Chinese State Scholarship Fund [2010629145]; International Max Planck Research School for the Physics of Biological and Complex Systems; Gottingen Graduate School for Neurosciences and Molecular Biosciences; Julich Supercomputing Centre [HGU16],"We thank A.

They have emerged as a robust solid-state platform for next-generation optoelectronic applications as well as for fundamental studies of quantum many-body physics. Importantly, exciton-polaritons are a profoundly open (that is, non-Hermitian(4,5)) quantum system, which requires constant pumping of energy and continuously decays, releasing coherent radiation(6). Thus, the exciton-polaritons always exist in a balanced potential landscape of gain and loss. However, the inherent non-Hermitian nature of this potential has so far been largely ignored in exciton-polariton physics. Here we demonstrate that non-Hermiticity dramatically modifies the structure of modes and spectral degeneracies in exciton-polariton systems, and, therefore, will affect their quantum transport, localization and dynamical properties(7-9). Using a spatially structured optical pump(10-12), we create a chaotic exciton-polariton billiard-a two-dimensional area enclosed by a curved potential barrier. Eigenmodes of this billiard exhibit multiple non-Hermitian spectral degeneracies, known as exceptional points(13,14). Such points can cause remarkable wave phenomena, such as unidirectional transport(15), anomalous lasing/absorption(16,17) and chiral modes(18). By varying parameters of the billiard, we observe crossing and anti-crossing of energy levels and reveal the non-trivial topological modal structure exclusive to non-Hermitian systems(9,13-22). We also observe mode switching and a topological Berry phase for a parameter loop encircling the exceptional point(23,24). Our findings pave the way to studies of non-Hermitian quantum dynamics of exciton-polaritons, which may uncover novel operating principles for polariton-based devices.","[Gao, T.; Estrecho, E.; Bliokh, K.

Mangrove forests have the capacity to keep pace with sea-level rise and to avoid inundation through vertical accretion of sediments, which allows them to maintain wetland soil elevations suitable for plant growth(3). The Indo-Pacific region holds most of the world's mangrove forests(4), but sediment delivery in this region is declining, owing to anthropogenic activities such as damming of rivers(5). This decline is of particular concern because the Indo-Pacific region is expected to have variable, but high, rates of future sea-level rise(6,7). Here we analyse recent trends in mangrove surface elevation changes across the Indo-Pacific region using data from a network of surface elevation table instruments(8-10). We find that sediment availability can enable mangrove forests to maintain rates of soil-surface elevation gain that match or exceed that of sea-level rise, but for 69 per cent of our study sites the current rate of sea-level rise exceeded the soil surface elevation gain. We also present a model based on our field data, which suggests that mangrove forests at sites with low tidal range and low sediment supply could be submerged as early as 2070.","[Lovelock, Catherine E.; Reef, Ruth; Swales, Andrew] Univ Queensland, Sch Biol Sci, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia; [Lovelock, Catherine E.; Reef, Ruth; Saunders, Megan L.] Univ Queensland, Global Change Inst, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia; [Cahoon, Donald R.; Guntenspergen, Glenn R.] US Geol Survey, Patuxent Wildlife Res Ctr, Laurel, MD 20708 USA; [Friess, Daniel A.] Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Geog, Singapore 117570, Singapore; [Reef, Ruth] Univ Cambridge, Dept Geog, Cambridge Coastal Res Unit, Cambridge CB2 3EN, England; [Rogers, Kerrylee] Univ Wollongong, Sch Earth & Environm Sci, Wollongong, NSW 2522, Australia; [Sidik, Frida] Minist Marine Affairs & Fisheries, Inst Marine Res & Observat, Bali 82251, Indonesia; [Swales, Andrew] Natl Inst Water & Atmospher Res, Hamilton 3251, New Zealand; [Saintilan, Neil] Macquarie Univ, Dept Environm Sci, Sydney, NSW 2109, Australia; [Thuyen, Le Xuan; Triet, Tran] Vietnam Natl Univ, Univ Sci, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam","Lovelock, CE (reprint author), Univ Queensland, Sch Biol Sci, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia.",c.lovelock@uq.edu.au,"Lovelock, Catherine/G-7370-2012; Saunders, Megan/I-7731-2012","Lovelock, Catherine/0000-0002-2219-6855; Saunders, Megan/0000-0002-8549-5609; Sidik, Frida/0000-0001-7329-9937",Australian Research Council [FS100100024]; US Geological Survey Climate and Land Use Research and Development Program,"The Global Change Institute at The University of Queensland supported this collaboration, as did the Australian Research Council SuperScience grant number FS100100024 to the Australia Sea Level Rise Partnerships.

Regenerating the kidney requires the induction of the more than 20 distinct cell types required for excretion and the regulation of pH, and electrolyte and fluid balance. We have previously described the simultaneous induction of progenitors for both collecting duct and nephrons via the directed differentiation of human pluripotent stem cells(1). Paradoxically, although both are of intermediate mesoderm in origin, collecting duct and nephrons have distinct temporospatial origins. Here we identify the developmental mechanism regulating the preferential induction of collecting duct versus kidney mesenchyme progenitors. Using this knowledge, we have generated kidney organoids that contain nephrons associated with a collecting duct network surrounded by renal interstitium and endothelial cells. Within these organoids, individual nephrons segment into distal and proximal tubules, early loops of Henle, and glomeruli containing podocytes elaborating foot processes and undergoing vascularization. When transcription profiles of kidney organoids were compared to human fetal tissues, they showed highest congruence with first trimester human kidney. Furthermore, the proximal tubules endocytose dextran and differentially apoptose in response to cisplatin, a nephrotoxicant. Such kidney organoids represent powerful models of the human organ for future applications, including nephrotoxicity screening, disease modelling and as a source of cells for therapy.","[Takasato, Minoru; Er, Pei X.; Little, Melissa H.] Royal Childrens Hosp Melbourne, Murdoch Childrens Res Inst, Parkville, Vic 3052, Australia; [Takasato, Minoru; Chiu, Han S.; Maier, Barbara; Baillie, Gregory J.; Ferguson, Charles; Parton, Robert G.; Little, Melissa H.] Univ Queensland, Inst Mol Biosci, St Lucia, Qld 4072, Australia; [Wolvetang, Ernst J.] Univ Queensland, Australian Inst Bioengn & Nanotechnol, St Lucia, Qld 4072, Australia; [Roost, Matthias S.; Lopes, Susana M.

Here we investigate avian phylogeny with an unprecedented scale of data: >390,000 bases of genomic sequence data from each of 198 species of living birds, representing all major avian lineages, and two crocodilian outgroups. Sequence data were collected using anchored hybrid enrichment, yielding 259 nuclear loci with an average length of 1,523 bases for a total data set of over 7.8x10(7) bases. Bayesian and maximum likelihood analyses yielded highly supported and nearly identical phylogenetic trees for all major avian lineages. Five major clades form successive sister groups to the rest of Neoaves: (1) a clade including nightjars, other caprimulgiforms, swifts, and hummingbirds; (2) a clade uniting cuckoos, bustards, and turacos with pigeons, mesites, and sandgrouse; (3) cranes and their relatives; (4) a comprehensive waterbird clade, including all diving, wading, and shorebirds; and (5) a comprehensive landbird clade with the enigmatic hoatzin (Opisthocomus hoazin) as the sister group to the rest. Neither of the two main, recently proposed Neoavian clades-Columbea and Passerea(1)-were supported as monophyletic. The results of our divergence time analyses are congruent with the palaeontological record, supporting a major radiation of crown birds in the wake of the Cretaceous-Palaeogene (K-Pg) mass extinction.","[Prum, Richard O.; Dornburg, Alex; Townsend, Jeffrey P.] Yale Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Prum, Richard O.; Dornburg, Alex; Field, Daniel J.] Yale Univ, Peabody Museum Nat Hist, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Berv, Jacob S.] Cornell Univ, Fuller Evolutionary Biol Program, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Berv, Jacob S.] Cornell Lab Ornithol, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Dornburg, Alex] North Carolina Museum Nat Sci, Raleigh, NC 27601 USA; [Field, Daniel J.] Yale Univ, Dept Geol & Geophys, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Townsend, Jeffrey P.] Yale Univ, Dept Biostat, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Townsend, Jeffrey P.] Yale Univ, Program Computat Biol & Bioinformat, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Lemmon, Emily Moriarty] Florida State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA; [Lemmon, Alan R.] Florida State Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA","Prum, RO (reprint author), Yale Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, New Haven, CT 06520 USA.",richard.prum@yale.edu; jsb439@cornell.edu,,"Field, Daniel/0000-0002-1786-0352; Dornburg, Alex/0000-0003-0863-2283",Yale University; NSF; NIH,"The research was supported by W.

Early results suggested that the ecosystem productivity of diverse grassland plant communities was more resistant, changing less during drought, and more resilient, recovering more quickly after drought, than that of depauperate communities(2). However, subsequent experimental tests produced mixed results(3-13). Here we use data from 46 experiments that manipulated grassland plant diversity to test whether biodiversity provides resistance during and resilience after climate events. We show that biodiversity increased ecosystem resistance for a broad range of climate events, including wet or dry, moderate or extreme, and brief or prolonged events. Across all studies and climate events, the productivity of low-diversity communities with one or two species changed by approximately 50% during climate events, whereas that of high-diversity communities with 16-32 species was more resistant, changing by only approximately 25%. By a year after each climate event, ecosystem productivity had often fully recovered, or overshot, normal levels of productivity in both high-and low-diversity communities, leading to no detectable dependence of ecosystem resilience on biodiversity. Our results suggest that biodiversity mainly stabilizes ecosystem productivity, and productivity-dependent ecosystem services, by increasing resistance to climate events. Anthropogenic environmental changes that drive biodiversity loss thus seem likely to decrease ecosystem stability(14), and restoration of biodiversity to increase it, mainly by changing the resistance of ecosystem productivity to climate events.","[Isbell, Forest; Seabloom, Eric W.; Tilman, David] Univ Minnesota Twin Cities, Dept Ecol Evolut & Behav, St Paul, MN 55108 USA; [Craven, Dylan; Bruelheide, Helge; Roscher, Christiane; Thakur, Madhav P.; Weigelt, Alexandra; Eisenhauer, Nico] German Ctr Integrat Biodivers Res iDiv, D-04103 Leipzig, Germany; [Craven, Dylan; Thakur, Madhav P.; Weigelt, Alexandra; Eisenhauer, Nico] Univ Leipzig, Inst Biol, D-04103 Leipzig, Germany; [Connolly, John] Natl Univ Ireland Univ Coll Dublin, Sch Math & Stat, Ecol & Environm Modelling Grp, Dublin 4, Ireland; [Loreau, Michel] CNRS, Expt Ecol Stn, Ctr Biodivers Theory & Modelling, F-09200 Moulis, France; [Schmid, Bernhard; de Luca, Enrica; Niklaus, Pascal A.] Univ Zurich, Inst Evolutionary Biol & Environm Studies, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland; [Beierkuhnlein, Carl] Univ Bayreuth, BayCEER, Dept Biogeog, D-95440 Bayreuth, Germany; [Bezemer, T.

Although previous studies have demonstrated that certain embryonic developmental programs are reactivated aberrantly in adult organs to drive repair and regeneration(1-3), it is not well understood how quiescence is maintained in organs such as the lung, which displays a remarkably low level of cellular turnover(4,5). Here we demonstrate that quiescence in the adult lung is an actively maintained state and is regulated by hedgehog signalling. Epithelial-specific deletion of sonic hedgehog (Shh) during postnatal homeostasis in the murine lung results in a proliferative expansion of the adjacent lung mesenchyme. Hedgehog signalling is initially downregulated during the acute phase of epithelial injury as the mesenchyme proliferates in response, but returns to baseline during injury resolution as quiescence is restored. Activation of hedgehog during acute epithelial injury attenuates the proliferative expansion of the lung mesenchyme, whereas inactivation of hedgehog signalling prevents the restoration of quiescence during injury resolution. Finally, we show that hedgehog also regulates epithelial quiescence and regeneration in response to injury via a mesenchymal feedback mechanism. These results demonstrate that epithelial-mesenchymal interactions coordinated by hedgehog actively maintain postnatal tissue homeostasis, and deregulation of hedgehog during injury leads to aberrant repair and regeneration in the lung.","[Peng, Tien; Morley, Michael P.; Rathi, Komal S.; Morrisey, Edward E.] Univ Penn, Dept Med, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Frank, David B.] Univ Penn, Dept Pediat, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Kadzik, Rachel S.; Morrisey, Edward E.] Univ Penn, Dept Cell & Dev Biol, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Morley, Michael P.; Rathi, Komal S.; Morrisey, Edward E.] Univ Penn, Penn Ctr Pulm Biol, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Morley, Michael P.; Rathi, Komal S.; Wang, Tao; Zhou, Su; Cheng, Lan; Lu, Min Min; Morrisey, Edward E.] Univ Penn, Penn Cardiovasc Inst, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Morrisey, Edward E.] Univ Penn, Penn Inst Regenerat Med, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA","Morrisey, EE (reprint author), Univ Penn, Dept Med, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",tien.peng@ucsf.edu; emorrise@mail.med.upenn.edu,"Bertoncello, Ivan/B-9235-2008",,"National Institutes of Health [HL110942, HL100405, HL087825]; American Heart Association Fellow-to-Faculty Transition Award; Actelion ENTELLIGENCE Award;  [K08-HL121146]","The authors appreciate the input of M.

Accordingly, RAF inhibitors have brought substantially improved personalized treatment of metastatic melanoma(2-5). However, these targeted agents have also revealed an unexpected consequence: stimulated growth of certain cancers(6-9). Structurally diverse ATP-competitive RAF inhibitors can either inhibit or paradoxically activate the MAPK pathway, depending whether activation is by BRAF mutation or by an upstream event, such as RAS mutation or receptor tyrosine kinase activation(10-12). Here we have identified next-generation RAF inhibitors (dubbed 'paradox breakers') that suppress mutant BRAF cells without activating the MAPK pathway in cells bearing upstream activation. In cells that express the same HRAS mutation prevalent in squamous tumours from patients treated with RAF inhibitors, the first-generation RAF inhibitor vemurafenib stimulated in vitro and in vivo growth and induced expression of MAPK pathway response genes; by contrast the paradox breakers PLX7904 and PLX8394 had no effect. Paradox breakers also overcame several known mechanisms of resistance to first-generation RAF inhibitors. Dissociating MAPK pathway inhibition from paradoxical activation might yield both improved safety and more durable efficacy than first-generation RAF inhibitors, a concept currently undergoing human clinical evaluation with PLX8394.","[Zhang, Chao; Spevak, Wayne; Zhang, Ying; Burton, Elizabeth A.; Ma, Yan; Habets, Gaston; Zhang, Jiazhong; Lin, Jack; Ewing, Todd; Matusow, Bernice; Tsang, Garson; Marimuthu, Adhirai; Cho, Hanna; Wu, Guoxian; Wang, Weiru; Fong, Daniel; Hoa Nguyen; Shi, Songyuan; Womack, Patrick; Nespi, Marika; Shellooe, Rafe; Carias, Heidi; Powell, Ben; Light, Emily; Sanftner, Laura; Walters, Jason; Tsai, James; West, Brian L.; Visor, Gary; Rezaei, Hamid; Lin, Paul S.; Nolop, Keith; Ibrahim, Prabha N.; Hirth, Peter; Bollag, Gideon] Plexxikon Inc, Berkeley, CA 94710 USA","Bollag, G (reprint author), Plexxikon Inc, 91 Bolivar Dr, Berkeley, CA 94710 USA.",czhang@plexxikon.com; gbollag@plexxikon.com,,,,,,36,58,61,7,44,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,22-Oct,2015,526,7574,,,,,583,U298,,10.1038/nature14982,,16,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,CV1NX,WOS:000364026100052,26466569,No,Y,N,11/19/17

In marine sediments, AOM is performed by dual-species consortia of anaerobic methanotrophic archaea (ANME) and sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) inhabiting the methane-sulfate transition zone(3-5). The biochemical pathways and biological adaptations enabling this globally relevant process are not fully understood. Here we study the syntrophic interaction in thermophilic AOM (TAOM) between ANME-1 archaea and their consortium partner SRB HotSeep-1 (ref. 6) at 60 degrees C to test the hypothesis of a direct interspecies exchange of electrons(7,8.) The activity of TAOM consortia was compared to the first ANME-free culture of an AOM partner bacterium that grows using hydrogen as the sole electron donor. The thermophilic ANME-1 do not produce sufficient hydrogen to sustain the observed growth of the HotSeep-1 partner. Enhancing the growth of the HotSeep-1 partner by hydrogen addition represses methane oxidation and the metabolic activity of ANME-1. Further supporting the hypothesis of direct electron transfer between the partners, we observe that under TAOM conditions, both ANME and the HotSeep-1 bacteria overexpress genes for extracellular cytochrome production and form cell-to-cell connections that resemble the nanowire structures responsible for interspecies electron transfer between syntrophic consortia of Geobacter(9,10). HotSeep-1 highly expresses genes for pili production only during consortial growth using methane, and the nanowire-like structures are absent in HotSeep-1 cells isolated with hydrogen. These observations suggest that direct electron transfer is a principal mechanism in TAOM, which may also explain the enigmatic functioning and specificity of other methanotrophic ANME-SRB consortia.","[Wegener, Gunter; Krukenberg, Viola; Boetius, Antje] Max Planck Inst Marine Mikrobiol, D-28359 Bremen, Germany; [Wegener, Gunter; Boetius, Antje] Univ Bremen, Ctr Marine Environm Sci, MARUM, D-28359 Bremen, Germany; [Riedel, Dietmar] Max Planck Inst Biophys Chem, D-37077 Gottingen, Germany; [Tegetmeyer, Halina E.; Boetius, Antje] Alfred Wegener Inst Helmholtz Ctr Polar & Marine, D-27570 Bremerhaven, Germany; [Tegetmeyer, Halina E.] Univ Bielefeld, Ctr Biotechnol, D-33615 Bielefeld, Germany","Wegener, G (reprint author), Max Planck Inst Marine Mikrobiol, D-28359 Bremen, Germany.",gwegener@mpi-bremen.de; vkrukenb@mpi-bremen.de,"; Boetius, Antje/D-5459-2013","Tegetmeyer, Halina E./0000-0003-1970-4457; Wegener, Gunter/0000-0002-6819-373X; Boetius, Antje/0000-0003-2117-4176","DFG Leibniz program; DFG excellence cluster MARUM, Center of Marine Environmental Sciences, Bremen; Max Planck Society","We thank K.

In mammalian cells, the asymmetric distribution of m(6)A along mRNAs results in relatively less methylation in the 5' untranslated region (5'UTR) compared to other regions(6,7). However, whether and how 5'UTR methylation is regulated is poorly understood. Despite the crucial role of the 5'UTR in translation initiation, very little is known about whether m(6)A modification influences mRNA translation. Here we show that in response to heat shock stress, certain adenosines within the 5'UTR of newly transcribed mRNAs are preferentially methylated. Wefind that the dynamic 5'UTR methylation is a result of stress-induced nuclear localization of YTHDF2, a well-characterized m(6)A 'reader'. Upon heat shock stress, the nuclear YTHDF2 preserves 5'UTR methylation of stress-induced transcripts by limiting the m(6)A 'eraser' FTO from demethylation. Remarkably, the increased 5'UTR methylation in the form of m(6)A promotes cap-independent translation initiation, providing a mechanism for selective mRNA translation under heat shock stress. Using Hsp70 mRNA as an example, we demonstrate that a single m(6)A modification site in the 5'UTR enables translation initiation independent of the 5' end N-7-methylguanosine cap. The elucidation of the dynamic features of 5'UTR methylation and its critical role in cap-independent translation not only expands the breadth of physiological roles of m(6)A, but also uncovers a previously unappreciated translational control mechanism in heat shock response.","[Zhou, Jun; wan, Ji; Gao, Xiangwei; Zhang, Xingqian; Qian, Shu-Bing] Cornell Univ, Div Nutr Sci, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Jaffrey, Samie R.] Cornell Univ, Weill Cornell Med Coll, Dept Pharmacol, New York, NY 10065 USA","Qian, SB (reprint author), Cornell Univ, Div Nutr Sci, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",sq38@cornell.edu,"Zhou, Jun/J-3035-2015",,"US National Institutes of Health [DP2 OD006449, R01AG042400]; NIDA [DA037150]; US Department of Defense [W81XWH-14-1-0068]",We would like to thank Qian laboratory members for helpful discussions and Cornell University Life Sciences Core Laboratory Center for performing deep sequencing.

The key mammalian characteristics originated during this period and were prerequisite for their evolutionary success after extinction of the non-avian dinosaurs 66 million years ago. Many ecomorphotypes familiar to modern mammal fauna evolved independently early in mammalian evolutionary history. Here we report a 125-million-year-old eutriconodontan mammal from Spain with extraordinary preservation of skin and pelage that extends the record of key mammalian integumentary features into the Mesozoic era. The new mammalian specimen exhibits such typical mammalian features as pelage, mane, pinna, and a variety of skin structures: keratinous dermal scutes, protospines composed of hair-like tubules, and compound follicles with primary and secondary hairs. The skin structures of this new Mesozoic mammal encompass the same combination of integumentary features as those evolved independently in other crown Mammalia, with similarly broad structural variations as in extant mammals. Soft tissues in the thorax and abdomen (alveolar lungs and liver) suggest the presence of a muscular diaphragm. The eutriconodont has molariform tooth replacement, ossified Meckel's cartilage of the middle ear, and specialized xenarthrous articulations of posterior dorsal vertebrae, convergent with extant xenarthran mammals, which strengthened the vertebral column for locomotion.","[Martin, Thomas] Univ Bonn, Steinmann Inst Geol Mineral & Palaontol, D-53115 Bonn, Germany; [Marugan-Lobon, Jesus; Martin-Abad, Hugo; Buscalioni, Angela D.] Univ Autonoma Madrid, Fac Ciencias, Dept Biol, Unidad Paleontol, E-28049 Madrid, Spain; [Marugan-Lobon, Jesus] Nat Hist Museum Los Angeles Cty, Dinosaur Inst, Los Angeles, CA 90007 USA; [Vullo, Romain] Univ Rennes 1, UMR CNRS 6118, Geosci Rennes, F-35042 Rennes, France; [Luo, Zhe-Xi] Univ Chicago, Dept Organismal Biol & Anat, Chicago, IL 60637 USA","Martin, T (reprint author), Univ Bonn, Steinmann Inst Geol Mineral & Palaontol, Nussallee 8, D-53115 Bonn, Germany.",tmartin@uni-bonn.de; zxluo@uchicago.edu; angela.delgado@uam.es,,,Spanish MINECO [CGL-2013-42643 P]; Junta de Comunidades de Castilla-La Mancha,"Research funds were provided by Spanish MINECO, Project CGL-2013-42643 P and Junta de Comunidades de Castilla-La Mancha.

We show that sexual conditioning, a form of associative learning, requires a pair of male-specific interneurons whose progenitors are fully differentiated glia. These neurons are generated during sexual maturation and incorporated into pre-exisiting sex-shared circuits to couple chemotactic responses to reproductive priorities. Our findings reveal a general role for glia as neural progenitors across metazoan taxa and demonstrate that the addition of sex-specific neuron types to brain circuits during sexual maturation is an important mechanism for the generation of sexually dimorphic plasticity in learning.","[Sammut, Michele; Felton, Terry; Poole, Richard J.; Barrios, Arantza] UCL, Dept Cell & Dev Biol, London WC1E 6BT, England; [Cook, Steven J.; Nguyen, Ken C.

Using lipidic cubic phase crystallization and microfocus X-ray diffraction, we determined the structure of human GLUT3 in complex with D-glucose at 1.5 angstrom resolution in an outward-occluded conformation. The high-resolution structure allows discrimination of both alpha- and beta-anomers of D-glucose. Two additional structures of GLUT3 bound to the exofacial inhibitor maltose were obtained at 2.6 angstrom in the outward-open and 2.4 angstrom in the outward-occluded states. In all three structures, the ligands are predominantly coordinated by polar residues from the carboxy terminal domain. Conformational transition from outward-open to outward-occluded entails a prominent local rearrangement of the extracellular part of transmembrane segment TM7. Comparison of the outward-facing GLUT3 structures with the inward-open GLUT1 provides insights into the alternating access cycle for GLUTs, whereby the C-terminal domain provides the primary substrate-binding site and the amino-terminal domain undergoes rigid-body rotation with respect to the C-terminal domain. Our studies provide an important framework for the mechanistic and kinetic understanding of GLUTs and shed light on structure-guided ligand design.","[Deng, Dong; Sun, Pengcheng; Yan, Chuangye; Ke, Meng; Jiang, Xin; Ren, Wenlin; Yan, Nieng] Tsinghua Univ, State Key Lab Membrane Biol, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China; [Deng, Dong; Sun, Pengcheng; Yan, Chuangye; Ke, Meng; Jiang, Xin; Ren, Wenlin; Fan, Shilong; Yan, Nieng] Tsinghua Univ, Struct Biol Ctr, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China; [Deng, Dong; Sun, Pengcheng; Yan, Chuangye; Ke, Meng; Xiong, Lei; Yan, Nieng] Tsinghua Univ, Tsinghua Peking Ctr Life Sci, Sch Life Sci, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China; [Deng, Dong; Sun, Pengcheng; Yan, Chuangye; Ke, Meng; Xiong, Lei; Yan, Nieng] Tsinghua Univ, Sch Med, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China; [Hirata, Kunio; Yamamoto, Masaki] RIKEN SPring 8 Ctr, Adv Photon Technol Div, Res Infrastruct Grp, SR Life Sci Instrumentat Unit, Mikazuki, Hyogo 6795148, Japan; [Hirata, Kunio] Japan Sci & Technol Agcy, Precursory Res Embryon Sci & Technol PRESTO, Kawaguchi, Saitama 3320012, Japan","Yan, N (reprint author), Tsinghua Univ, State Key Lab Membrane Biol, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China.",nyan@tsinghua.edu.cn,"Yamamoto, Masaki/B-7844-2015","Yamamoto, Masaki/0000-0002-1311-1768","Ministry of Science and Technology of China [2015CB910101, 2011CB910501, 2014ZX09507003006]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [31130002, 31125009]; Howard Hughes Medical Institute","We thank the Tsinghua University Branch of China National Center for Protein Sciences (Beijing) for providing the facility support.

The peculiar bilobed shape of comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko may be the result of the fusion of two objects that were once separate or the result of a localized excavation by outgassing at the interface between the two lobes(5). Here we report that the comet's major lobe is enveloped by a nearly continuous set of strata, up to 650 metres thick, which are independent of an analogous stratified envelope on the minor lobe. Gravity vectors computed for the two lobes separately are closer to perpendicular to the strata than those calculated for the entire nucleus and adjacent to the neck separating the two lobes. Therefore comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko is an accreted body of two distinct objects with 'onion-like' stratification, which formed before they merged. We conclude that gentle, low-velocity collisions occurred between two fully formed kilometre-sized cometesimals in the early stages of the Solar System. The notable structural similarities between the two lobes of comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko indicate that the early-forming cometesimals experienced similar primordial stratified accretion, even though they formed independently.","[Massironi, Matteo; Giacomini, Lorenza] Univ Padua, Dipartimento Geosci, I-35131 Padua, Italy; [Massironi, Matteo; Pajola, Maurizio; Naletto, Giampiero; Bertini, Ivano; Ferri, Francesca] Univ Padua, Ctr Ateneo Studi & Attivita Spaziali Giuseppe Col, I-35131 Padua, Italy; [Simioni, Emanuele; Naletto, Giampiero; Da Deppo, Vania] CNR INFN UOS Padova LUXOR, I-35131 Padua, Italy; [Marzari, Francesco; Barbieri, Cesare; La Forgia, Fiorangela; Lazzarin, Monica; Magrin, Sara] Univ Padua, Dept Phys & Astron, I-35122 Padua, Italy; [Cremonese, Gabriele] Osserv Astron Padova, INAF, I-35122 Padua, Italy; [Jorda, Laurent; Lamy, Philippe; Auger, Anne-Therese; Capanna, Claire; Groussin, Olivier] Aix Marseille Univ, CNRS, UMR 7326, LAM, F-13388 Marseille, France; [Naletto, Giampiero] Univ Padua, Dept Informat Engn, I-35131 Padua, Italy; [Lowry, Stephen] Univ Kent, Sch Phys Sci, Canterbury CT2 7NZ, Kent, England; [El-Maarry, Mohamed Ramy; Pommerol, Antoine; Thomas, Nicolas] Univ Bern, Inst Phys, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland; [Preusker, Frank; Scholten, Frank; Hviid, Stubbe F.; Knollenberg, Joerg; Kuehrt, Ekkehard; Mottola, Stefano] Deutsch Zentrum Luft & Raumfahrt DLR, Inst Planetenforsch, D-12489 Berlin, Germany; [Sierks, Holger; A'Hearn, Michael F.; Agarwal, Jessica; Guettler, Carsten; Hviid, Stubbe F.; Kovacs, Gabor; Kramm, Rainer; Oklay, Nilda; Tubiana, Cecilia; Vincent, Jean-Baptiste] Max Planck Inst Sonnensyst Forsch, D-37077 Gottingen, Germany; [Rodrigo, Rafael] CSIC INTA, Ctr Astrobiol, Madrid 28850, Spain; [Rodrigo, Rafael] Int Space Sci Inst, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland; [Koschny, Detlef; Besse, Sebastien] European Space Res & Technol Ctr ESA, Sci Support Off, NL-2201 AZ Noordwijk, Netherlands; [Rickman, Hans] Uppsala Univ, Dept Phys & Astron, S-75120 Uppsala, Sweden; [Rickman, Hans] PAS Space Res Ctr, PL-00716 Warsaw, Poland; [Keller, Horst Uwe] Tech Univ Carolo Wilhelmina Braunschweig, Inst Geophys & Extraterr Phys IGEP, D-38106 Braunschweig, Germany; [A'Hearn, Michael F.; Bodewits, Dennis] Univ Maryland, Dept Astron, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [A'Hearn, Michael F.] Akad Wissensch Gottingen, D-37077 Gottingen, Germany; [Barucci, M.

In contrast to the well-known single-gamma (gamma)-decay, the gamma-decay is characterized by the simultaneous emission of two gamma quanta, each with a continuous energy spectrum. In nuclear physics, this exotic decay mode has only been observed for transitions between states with spin-parity quantum numbers J(pi) = 0(+) (refs 1-3). Single-gamma decays the main experimental obstacle to observing the yy-decay are strictly forbidden for these 0(+) -> 0(+) transitions. Here we report the observation of the gamma-decay of an excited nuclear state (J(pi) = 11/2(-)) that is directly competing with an allowed y-decay (to ground state J(pi) = 3/2(+)). The branching ratio of the competitive gamma gamma-decay of the 11/2- isomer of Ba-137 to the ground state relative to its single gamma-decay was determined to be (2.05 +/- 0.37) X 10(-6). From the measured angular correlation and the shape of the energy spectra of the individual gamma-rays, the contributing combinations of multipolarities of the gamma radiation were determined. Transition matrix elements calculated using the quasipartide-phonon model reproduce our measurements well. The gamma gamma-decay rate gives access to so far unexplored important nuclear structure information, such as the generalized (off-diagonal) nuclear electric polarizabilities and magnetic susceptibilities(3).","[Walz, C.; Scheit, H.; Pietralla, N.; Aumann, T.; Lefol, R.; Ponomarev, V.

Many physical realizations of qubits exist, including single photons(3), trapped ions(4), superconducting circuits(5), single defects or atoms in diamond(6,7) and silicon(8), and semiconductor quantum dots(9), with single-qubit fidelities that exceed the stringent thresholds required for fault-tolerant quantum computing(10). Despite this, high-fidelity two-qubit gates in the solid state that can be manufactured using standard lithographic techniques have so far been limited to superconducting qubits(5), owing to the difficulties of coupling qubits and dephasing in semiconductor systems(11-13). Here we present a two-qubit logic gate, which uses single spins in isotopically enriched silicon(14) and is realized by performing single-and two-qubit operations in a quantum dot system using the exchange interaction, as envisaged in the Loss-DiVincenzo proposal(2). We realize CNOT gates via controlled-phase operations combined with single-qubit operations. Direct gate-voltage control provides single-qubit addressability, together with a switchable exchange interaction that is used in the two-qubit controlled-phase gate. By independently reading out both qubits, we measure clear anticorrelations in the two-spin probabilities of the CNOT gate.","[Veldhorst, M.; Yang, C. H.; Hwang, J. C. C.; Huang, W.; Dehollain, J.

Peptoids, which are relatively non-toxic and resistant to degradation3, can fold into defined structures through a combination of sequence-dependent interactions(3-8). However, the range of possible structures that are accessible to peptoids and other biological mimetics is unknown, and our ability to design protein-like architectures from these polymer classes is limited(9). Here we use molecular-dynamics simulations, together with scattering and microscopy data, to determine the atomic-resolution structure of the recently discovered peptoid nanosheet, an ordered supramolecular assembly that extends macroscopically in only two dimensions. Our simulations show that nanosheets are structurally and dynamically heterogeneous, can be formed only from peptoids of certain lengths, and are potentially porous to water and ions. Moreover, their formation is enabled by the peptoids' adoption of a secondary structure that is not seen in the natural world. This structure, a zigzag pattern that we call a Sigma('sigma')-strand, results from the ability of adjacent backbone monomers to adopt opposed rotational states, thereby allowing the backbone to remain linear and untwisted. Linear backbones tiled in a brick-like way form an extended two-dimensional nanostructure, the Sigma-sheet. The binary rotational-statemotif of the Sigma-strand is not seen in regular protein structures, which are usually built from one type of rotational state. We also show that the concept of building regular structures from multiple rotational states can be generalized beyond the peptoid nanosheet system.","[Mannige, Ranjan V.; Haxton, Thomas K.; Proulx, Caroline; Robertson, Ellen J.; Battigelli, Alessia; Zuckermann, Ronald N.; Whitelam, Stephen] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mol Foundry, Berkeley, CA 94709 USA; [Butterfoss, Glenn L.] New York Univ Abu Dhabi, Ctr Genom & Syst Biol, Abu Dhabi, U Arab Emirates","Mannige, RV (reprint author), Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mol Foundry, Berkeley, CA 94709 USA.",rvmannige@lbl.gov; swhitelam@lbl.gov,,,"Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences of the US Department of Energy [DE-AC02-05CH11231]; Defense Threat Reduction Agency [IACRO-B0845281]; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC PDF); Office of Science of the US Department of Energy [DE-AC02-05CH11231]","Portions of this work were done as a User project at the Molecular Foundry at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, supported by the Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, of the US Department of Energy under contract no.

If anthropogenic emissions continue unchecked, the warming increase may reach 8-10 degrees Celsius by 2300 (ref. 2). The contribution that large ice sheets will make to sea-level rise under such warming scenarios is difficult to quantify because the equilibrium-response timescale of ice sheets is longer than those of the atmosphere or ocean. Here we use a coupled ice-sheet/ice-shelf model to show that if atmospheric warming exceeds 1.5 to 2 degrees Celsius above present, collapse of the major Antarctic ice shelves triggers a centennial-to millennial-scale response of the Antarctic ice sheet in which enhanced viscous flow produces a long-term commitment (an unstoppable contribution) to sea-level rise. Our simulations represent the response of the present-day Antarctic ice-sheet system to the oceanic and climatic changes of four representative concentration pathways (RCPs) from the Fifth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change(3). We find that substantial Antarctic ice loss can be prevented only by limiting greenhouse gas emissions to RCP 2.6 levels. Higher-emissions scenarios lead to ice loss from Antarctic that will raise sea level by 0.6-3 metres by the year 2300. Our results imply that greenhouse gas emissions in the next few decades will strongly influence the long-term contribution of the Antarctic ice sheet to global sea level.","[Golledge, N.

To investigate some of the possible determinants and consequences of inequality, here we perform experiments involving a networked public goods game in which subjects interact and gain or lose wealth. Subjects (n =1,462) were randomly assigned to have higher or lower initial endowments, and were embedded within social networks with three levels of economic inequality (Gini coefficient=0.0, 0.2, and 0.4). In addition, we manipulated the visibility of the wealth of network neighbours. We show that wealth visibility facilitates the downstream consequences of initial inequality-in initially more unequal situations, wealth visibility leads to greater inequality than when wealth is invisible. This result reflects a heterogeneous response to visibility in richer versus poorer subjects. We also find that making wealth visible has adverse welfare consequences, yielding lower levels of overall cooperation, inter-connectedness, and wealth. High initial levels of economic inequality alone, however, have relatively few deleterious welfare effects.","[Nishi, Akihiro; Shirado, Hirokazu; Rand, David G.; Christakis, Nicholas A.] Yale Univ, Yale Inst Network Sci, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Nishi, Akihiro; Shirado, Hirokazu; Christakis, Nicholas A.] Yale Univ, Dept Sociol, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Rand, David G.] Yale Univ, Dept Psychol, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Rand, David G.] Yale Univ, Dept Econ, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Christakis, Nicholas A.] Yale Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Christakis, Nicholas A.] Yale Univ, Dept Med, New Haven, CT 06520 USA","Christakis, NA (reprint author), Yale Univ, Yale Inst Network Sci, New Haven, CT 06520 USA.",nicholas.christakis@yale.edu,,"Rand, David/0000-0001-8975-2783",Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS); Robert Wood Johnson Foundation,"We thank C.

Several studies in individuals with Alzheimer disease and in amnesic rats have demonstrated that DBS targeted to the fimbria-fornix(1-3), the region that appears to regulate hippocampal activity, can mitigate defects in hippocampus-dependent memory(3-5). Despite these promising results, DBS has not been tested for its ability to improve cognition in any childhood intellectual disability disorder. Such disorders are a pressing concern: they affect as much as 3% of the population and involve hundreds of different genes. We proposed that stimulating the neural circuits that underlie learning and memory might provide a more promising route to treating these otherwise intractable disorders than seeking to adjust levels of one molecule at a time. We therefore studied the effects of forniceal DBS in a well-characterized mouse model of Rett syndrome (RTT), which is a leading cause of intellectual disability in females. Caused by mutations that impair the function of MeCP2 (ref. 6), RTT appears by the second year of life in humans, causing profound impairment in cognitive, motor and social skills, along with an array of neurological features(7). RTT mice, which reproduce the broad phenotype of this disorder, also show clear deficits in hippocampus-dependent learning and memory and hippocampal synaptic plasticity(8-11). Here we show that forniceal DBS in RTT mice rescues contextual fear memory as well as spatial learning and memory. In parallel, forniceal DBS restores in vivo hippocampal long-term potentiation and hippocampal neurogenesis. These results indicate that forniceal DBS might mitigate cognitive dysfunction in RTT.","[Hao, Shuang; Tang, Bin; Wu, Zhenyu; Ure, Kerstin; Sun, Yaling; Tao, Huifang; Gao, Yan; Patel, Akash J.; Samaco, Rodney C.; Zoghbi, Huda Y.; Tang, Jianrong] Texas Childrens Hosp, Jan & Dan Duncan Neurol Res Inst, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Hao, Shuang; Tang, Bin; Wu, Zhenyu; Zoghbi, Huda Y.; Tang, Jianrong] Baylor Coll Med, Dept Pediat, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Sun, Yaling; Tao, Huifang; Gao, Yan; Samaco, Rodney C.; Zoghbi, Huda Y.] Baylor Coll Med, Dept Mol & Human Genet, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Patel, Akash J.; Curry, Daniel J.] Baylor Coll Med, Dept Neurosurg, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Zoghbi, Huda Y.] Baylor Coll Med, Program Dev Biol, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Zoghbi, Huda Y.] Baylor Coll Med, Dept Neurosci, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Zoghbi, Huda Y.] Baylor Coll Med, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Houston, TX 77030 USA","Zoghbi, HY (reprint author), Texas Childrens Hosp, Jan & Dan Duncan Neurol Res Inst, Houston, TX 77030 USA.",hzoghbi@bcm.edu; jtang1@bcm.edu,,"Samaco, Rodney/0000-0001-5636-5314","W.

Transection studies by Jouvet first demonstrated that the brainstem is both necessary and sufficient for REM sleep generation(2), and the neural circuits in the pons have since been studied extensively(4-8). The medulla also contains neurons that are active during REM sleep(9-13), but whether they play a causal role in REM sleep generation remains unclear. Here we show that a GABAergic (gamma-aminobutyric-acidreleasing) pathway originating from the ventral medulla powerfully promotes REM sleep in mice. Optogenetic activation of ventral medulla GABAergic neurons rapidly and reliably initiated REM sleep episodes and prolonged their durations, whereas inactivating these neurons had the opposite effects. Optrode recordings from channelrhodopsin-2-tagged ventral medulla GABAergic neurons showed that they were most active during REM sleep (REMmax), and during wakefulness they were preferentially active during eating and grooming. Furthermore, dual retrograde tracing showed that the rostral projections to the pons and midbrain and caudal projections to the spinal cord originate from separate ventral medulla neuron populations. Activating the rostral GABAergic projections was sufficient for both the induction and maintenance of REM sleep, which are probably mediated in part by inhibition of REM suppressing GABAergic neurons in the ventrolateral periaqueductal grey. These results identify a key component of the pontomedullary network controlling REM sleep. The capability to induce REM sleep on command may offer a powerful tool for investigating its functions.","[Weber, Franz; Chung, Shinjae; Xu, Min; Dan, Yang] Univ Calif Berkeley, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Helen Wills Neurosci Inst, Div Neurobiol,Dept Mol & Cell Biol, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Beier, Kevin T.; Luo, Liqun] Stanford Univ, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Dept Biol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA","Dan, Y (reprint author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Helen Wills Neurosci Inst, Div Neurobiol,Dept Mol & Cell Biol, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",ydan@berkeley.edu,,"Beier, Kevin/0000-0002-4934-1338",EMBO; Human Frontier Science Program,"We thank A.

However, this encoding of action for rapid eye movements (saccades) has remained unclear: Purkinje cells show little consistent modulation with respect to saccade amplitude(4,5) or direction(4), and critically, their discharge lasts longer than the duration of a saccade(6,7). Here we analysed Purkinje-cell discharge in the oculomotor vermis of behaving rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta)(8,9) and found neurons that increased or decreased their activity during saccades. We estimated the combined effect of these two populations via their projections to the caudal fastigial nucleus, and uncovered a simple-spike population response that precisely predicted the real-time motion of the eye. When we organized the Purkinje cells according to each cell's complex-spike directional tuning, the simple-spike population response predicted both the real-time speed and direction of saccade multiplicatively via a gain field. This suggests that the cerebellum predicts the real-time motion of the eye during saccades via the combined inputs of Purkinje cells onto individual nucleus neurons. A gain-field encoding of simple spikes emerges if the Purkinje cells that project onto a nucleus neuron are not selected at random but share a common complex-spike property.","[Herzfeld, David J.; Shadmehr, Reza] Johns Hopkins Univ, Sch Med, Lab Computat Motor Control, Dept Biomed Engn, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA; [Kojima, Yoshiko; Soetedjo, Robijanto] Univ Washington, Dept Physiol & Biophys, Washington Natl Primate Ctr, Seattle, WA 98195 USA","Herzfeld, DJ (reprint author), Johns Hopkins Univ, Sch Med, Lab Computat Motor Control, Dept Biomed Engn, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA.",dherzfe1@jhmi.edu; shadmehr@jhu.edu,,,"NIH [R01NS078311, R01EY019258, R01EY023277, F31NS090860]","These data were collected in the laboratory of A.

Two principal physiological pathways either prevent or promote amyloid-beta generation from its precursor, beta-amyloid precursor protein (APP), in a competitive manne(r)1. Although APP processing has been studied in great detail, unknown proteolytic events seem to hinder stoichiometric analyses of APP metabolism in vivo(2). Here we describe a new physiological APP processing pathway, which generates proteolytic fragments capable of inhibiting neuronal activity within the hippocampus. We identify higher molecular mass carboxy-terminal fragments (CTFs) of APP, termed CTF-eta, in addition to the long-known CTF-alpha and CTF-beta fragments generated by the alpha- and beta-secretases ADAM10 (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase 10) and BACE1 (beta-site APP cleaving enzyme 1), respectively. CTF-eta generation is mediated in part by membrane-bound matrix metalloproteinases such as MT5-MMP, referred to as g-secretase activity. g-Secretase cleavage occurs primarily at amino acids 504-505 of APP(695), releasing a truncated ectodomain. After shedding of this ectodomain, CTF-eta is further processed by ADAM10 and BACE1 to release long and short A eta peptides (termed A eta-alpha and A eta-beta). CTFs produced by g-secretase are enriched in dystrophic neurites in an AD mouse model and in human AD brains. Genetic and pharmacological inhibition of BACE1 activity results in robust accumulation of CTF-eta and A eta-alpha. In mice treated with a potent BACE1 inhibitor, hippocampal long-term potentiation was reduced. Notably, when recombinant or synthetic A eta-alpha was applied on hippocampal slices ex vivo, long-term potentiation was lowered. Furthermore, in vivo single-cell two-photon calcium imaging showed that hippocampal neuronal activity was attenuated by A eta-alpha. These findings not only demonstrate a major functionally relevant APP processing pathway, but may also indicate potential translational relevance for therapeutic strategies targeting APP processing.","[Willem, Michael; Daria, Anna; Hampel, Heike; Mueller, Veronika; Giudici, Camilla; Nuscher, Brigitte; Haass, Christian] Univ Munich, Biomed Ctr BMC, D-81377 Munich, Germany; [Tahirovic, Sabina; Ovsepian, Saak V.; Wenninger-Weinzierl, Andrea; Kremmer, Elisabeth; Herms, Jochen; Haass, Christian] German Ctr Neurodegenerat Dis DZNE Munich, D-81377 Munich, Germany; [Busche, Marc Aurel] Tech Univ Munich, Dept Psychiat & Psychotherapy, D-81675 Munich, Germany; [Busche, Marc Aurel; Konnerth, Arthur] Tech Univ Munich, Inst Neurosci, D-80802 Munich, Germany; [Busche, Marc Aurel; Kremmer, Elisabeth; Konnerth, Arthur; Haass, Christian] Univ Munich, Munich Cluster Syst Neurol SyNergy, D-81377 Munich, Germany; [Chafai, Magda; Kootar, Scherazad; Marie, Helene] Univ Nice Sophia Antipolis, UMR 7275, CNRS, IPMC, F-06560 Valbonne, France; [Hornburg, Daniel; Meissner, Felix] Max Planck Inst Biochem, D-82152 Martinsried, Germany; [Evans, Lewis D.

In multiple sclerosis, an inflammatory demyelinating disease, endogenous remyelination does occur but is frequently insufficient to restore function. Both parenchymal oligodendrocyte progenitor cells and endogenous adult neural stem cells resident within the subventricular zone are known sources of remyelinating cells(2). Here we characterize the contribution to remyelination of a subset of adult neural stem cells, identified by their expression of Gli1, a transcriptional effector of the sonic hedgehog pathway. We show that these cells are recruited from the subventricular zone to populate demyelinated lesions in the forebrain but never enter healthy, white matter tracts. Unexpectedly, recruitment of this pool of neural stem cells, and their differentiation into oligodendrocytes, is significantly enhanced by genetic or pharmacological inhibition of Gli1. Importantly, complete inhibition of canonical hedgehog signalling was ineffective, indicating that the role of Gli1 both in augmenting hedgehog signalling and in retarding myelination is specialized. Indeed, inhibition of Gli1 improves the functional outcome in a relapsing/remitting model of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis and is neuroprotective. Thus, endogenous neural stem cells can be mobilized for the repair of demyelinated lesions by inhibiting Gli1, identifying a new therapeutic avenue for the treatment of demyelinating disorders.","[Samanta, Jayshree; Grund, Ethan M.; Fishell, Gord; Salzer, James L.] NYU, Sch Med, Dept Neurosci & Physiol, Inst Neurosci, New York, NY 10016 USA; [Silva, Hernandez M.; Lafaille, Juan J.] NYU, Sch Med, Kimmel Ctr Biol & Med, Skirball Inst, New York, NY 10016 USA","Samanta, J (reprint author), NYU, Sch Med, Dept Neurosci & Physiol, Inst Neurosci, New York, NY 10016 USA.",jayshree.samanta@nyumc.org; james.salzer@nyumc.org,,"Salzer, James/0000-0001-9126-7197",New York State Department of Health Stem Cell Board; National Multiple Sclerosis Society,"We thank A.

Here we report a novel isoform of the anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) that is expressed in similar to 11% of melanomas and sporadically in other human cancer types, but not in normal tissues. The novelALK transcript initiates from a de novo alternative transcription initiation (ATI) site in ALK intron 19, and was termed ALK(ATI). In ALK(ATI)-expressing tumours, the ATI site is enriched for H3K4me3 and RNA polymerase II, chromatin marks characteristic of active transcription initiation sites(1). ALK(ATI) is expressed from both ALK alleles, and no recurrent genetic aberrations are found at the ALK locus, indicating that the transcriptional activation is independent of genetic aberrations at the ALK locus. The ALK(ATI) transcript encodes three proteins with molecular weights of 61.1, 60.8 and 58.7 kilodaltons, consisting primarily of the intracellular tyrosine kinase domain. ALK(ATI) stimulates multiple oncogenic signalling pathways, drives growth-factor-independent cell proliferation in vitro, and promotes tumorigenesis in vivo in mouse models.

Understanding the effect of this control effort is vital to inform future control planning. However, the effect of malaria interventions across the varied epidemiological settings of Africa remains poorly understood owing to the absence of reliable surveillance data and the simplistic approaches underlying current disease estimates. Here we link a large database of malaria field surveys with detailed reconstructions of changing intervention coverage to directly evaluate trends from 2000 to 2015, and quantify the attributable effect of malaria disease control efforts. We found that Plasmodium falciparum infection prevalence in endemic Africa halved and the incidence of clinical disease fell by 40% between 2000 and 2015. We estimate that interventions have averted 663 (542753 credible interval) million clinical cases since 2000. Insecticide-treated nets, the most widespread intervention, were by far the largest contributor (68% of cases averted). Although still below target levels, current malaria interventions have substantially reduced malaria disease incidence across the continent. Increasing access to these interventions, and maintaining their effectiveness in the face of insecticide and drug resistance, should form a cornerstone of post-2015 control strategies.","[Bhatt, S.; Weiss, D.

By an unidentified mechanism, Nef increases the intrinsic infectivity of HIV-1 virions in a host-cell-dependent manner. Here we identify the host transmembrane protein SERINC5, and to a lesser extent SERINC3, as a potent inhibitor of HIV-1 particle infectivity that is counteracted by Nef. SERINC5 localizes to the plasma membrane, where it is efficiently incorporated into budding HIV-1 virions and impairs subsequent virion penetration of susceptible target cells. Nef redirects SERINC5 to a Rab7-positive endosomal compartment and thereby excludes it from HIV-1 particles. The ability to counteract SERINC5 was conserved in Nef encoded by diverse primate immunodeficiency viruses, as well as in the structurally unrelated glycosylated Gag from murine leukaemia virus. These examples of functional conservation and convergent evolution emphasize the fundamental importance of SERINC5 as a potent anti-retroviral factor.","[Rosa, Annachiara; Chande, Ajit; Ziglio, Serena; Pizzato, Massimo] Univ Trent, Ctr Integrat Biol, I-38123 Trento, Italy; [De Sanctis, Veronica; Bertorelli, Roberto] Univ Trent, Lab Biomol Sequence & Struct Anal Hlth, NGS Facil, I-38123 Trento, Italy; [Goh, Shih Lin; McCauley, Sean M.; Nowosielska, Anetta; Luban, Jeremy] Univ Massachusetts, Sch Med, Program Mol Med, Worcester, MA 01605 USA; [Antonarakis, Stylianos E.; Santoni, Federico Andrea] Univ Geneva, Dept Genet Med & Dev, CH-1211 Geneva, Switzerland; [Antonarakis, Stylianos E.] IGE3 Inst Genet & Genom Geneva, CH-1211 Geneva, Switzerland","Pizzato, M (reprint author), Univ Trent, Ctr Integrat Biol, I-38123 Trento, Italy.",massimo.pizzato@unitn.it,,"Chande, Ajit/0000-0003-2210-5180; Antonarakis, Stylianos/0000-0001-8907-5823",University of Trento; FP7 Marie Curie Career Integration grant [322130]; Caritro 'Ricerca Biomedica' grant [2013.0248]; National Institute of Health [DP1DA034990]; European Research Council [249968],"We thank the Centre for AIDS Reagents, NIBSC, and NIH AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program, Division of AIDS, for cell lines, plasmids and antibodies.

Here we show that Nef and glycoGag prevent the incorporation of the multipass transmembrane proteins serine incorporator 3 (SERINC3) and SERINC5 into HIV-1 virions to an extent that correlates with infectivity enhancement. Silencing of both SERINC3 and SERINC5 precisely phenocopied the effects of Nef and glycoGag on HIV-1 infectivity. The infectivity of nef-deficient virions increased more than 100-fold when produced in double-knockout human CD4(+) T cells that lack both SERINC3 and SERINC5, and re-expression experiments confirmed that the absence of SERINC3 and SERINC5 accounted for the infectivity enhancement. Furthermore, SERINC3 and SERINC5 together restricted HIV-1 replication, and this restriction was evaded by Nef. SERINC3 and SERINC5 are highly expressed in primary human HIV-1 target cells, and inhibiting their downregulation by Nef is a potential strategy to combat HIV/AIDS.","[Usami, Yoshiko; Wu, Yuanfei; Goettlinger, Heinrich G.] Univ Massachusetts, Sch Med, Dept Mol Cell & Canc Biol, Worcester, MA 01605 USA","Gottlinger, HG (reprint author), Univ Massachusetts, Sch Med, Dept Mol Cell & Canc Biol, Worcester, MA 01605 USA.",heinrich.gottlinger@umassmed.edu,,,NIAID/NIH [R01AI029873]; NIDA/NIH [DP1DA038034],"We thank J.

Understanding of molecular mechanisms and pharmacology of glycine receptors has been hindered by a lack of high-resolution structures. Here we report electron cryo-microscopy structures of the zebrafish alpha 1 GlyR with strychnine, glycine, or glycine and ivermectin (glycine/ivermectin). Strychnine arrests the receptor in an antagonist-bound closed ion channel state, glycine stabilizes the receptor in an agonist-bound open channel state, and the glycine/ivermectin complex adopts a potentially desensitized or partially open state. Relative to the glycine-bound state, strychnine expands the agonist-binding pocket via outward movement of the C loop, promotes rearrangement of the extracellular and transmembrane domain 'wrist' interface, and leads to rotation of the transmembrane domain towards the pore axis, occluding the ion conduction pathway. These structures illuminate the GlyR mechanism and define a rubric to interpret structures of Cys-loop receptors.","[Du, Juan; Lu, Wei; Gouaux, Eric] Oregon Hlth & Sci Univ, Vollum Inst, Portland, OR 97239 USA; [Wu, Shenping; Cheng, Yifan] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Biochem & Biophys, San Francisco, CA 94158 USA; [Gouaux, Eric] Oregon Hlth & Sci Univ, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Portland, OR 97239 USA","Gouaux, E (reprint author), Oregon Hlth & Sci Univ, Vollum Inst, 3181 SW Sam Jackson Pk Rd, Portland, OR 97239 USA.",gouauxe@ohsu.edu,,,National Institute of Health,"We are grateful to Z.

These 'debris disks' were thought to be by-products of planet formation because they often exhibited morphological and brightness asymmetries that may result from gravitational perturbation by planets. This was proved to be true for the beta Pictoris system, in which the known planet generates an observable warp in the disk(2-5). The nearby, young, unusually active late-type star AU Microscopii hosts a well-studied edge-on debris disk; earlier observations in the visible and near-infrared found asymmetric localized structures in the form of intensity variations along the midplane of the disk beyond a distance of 20 astronomical units(6-9). Here we report high-contrast imaging that reveals a series of five large-scale features in the southeast side of the disk, at projected separations of 10-60 astronomical units, persisting over intervals of 1-4 years. All these features appear to move away from the star at projected speeds of 4-10 kilometres per second, suggesting highly eccentric or unbound trajectories if they are associated with physical entities. The origin, localization, morphology and rapid evolution of these features are difficult to reconcile with current theories.","[Boccaletti, Anthony] Univ Paris 06, Univ Paris Diderot, CNRS, Observ Paris,LESIA, F-92190 Meudon, France; [Thalmann, Christian; Engler, Natalia; Meyer, Michael R.; Schmid, Hans Martin] ETH, Inst Astron, CH-8093 Zurich, Switzerland; [Lagrange, Anne-Marie; Augereau, Jean-Charles; Mouillet, David; Beuzit, Jean-Luc] Univ Grenoble Alpes, IPAG, F-38000 Grenoble, France; [Lagrange, Anne-Marie; Augereau, Jean-Charles; Milli, Julien; Beuzit, Jean-Luc; Girard, Julien H.; Kasper, Markus] IPAG, CNRS, F-38000 Grenoble, France; [Janson, Markus] Stockholm Univ, Dept Astron, SE-10691 Stockholm, Sweden; [Janson, Markus; Henning, Thomas; Carson, Joseph; Olofsson, Johan] Max Planck Inst Astron, D-69117 Heidelberg, Germany; [Schneider, Glenn] Univ Arizona, Steward Observ, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA; [Milli, Julien; Girard, Julien H.; Vigan, Arthur; Wahhaj, Zahed] ESO, Santiago 19001, Chile; [Grady, Carol] Eureka Sci, Oakland, CA 96002 USA; [Debes, John; Hines, Dean] Space Telescope Sci Inst, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA; [Langlois, Maud] Univ Lyon 1, CNRS, Ctr Rech Astrophys Lyon, ENS L, F-69561 St Genis Laval, France; [Langlois, Maud; Dohlen, Kjetil; Fusco, Thierry; Moutou, Claire; Sauvage, Jean-Francois; Vigan, Arthur; Wahhaj, Zahed] Aix Marseille Univ, CNRS, LAM, UMR 7326, F-13388 Marseille, France; [Dominik, Carsten] Univ Amsterdam, Astron Inst Anton Pannekoek, NL-1098 XH Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Maire, Anne-Lise; Turatto, Massimo] INAF Osservatorio Astron Padova, I-35122 Padua, Italy; [Carson, Joseph] Coll Charleston, Dept Phys & Astron, Charleston, SC 29424 USA; [Fusco, Thierry; Sauvage, Jean-Francois] Off Natl Etud & Rech Aerosp, F-92322 Chatillon, France; [Ginski, Christian] Sterrewacht Leiden, NL-2300 RA Leiden, Netherlands; [Kasper, Markus] ESO, D-85748 Garching, Germany; [Mawet, Dimitri] CALTECH, Dept Astron, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA; [Menard, Franois] INSU France, CNRS, UMI, FCA,UMI 3386, Montpellier, France; [Menard, Franois] Univ Chile, Dept Astron, Santiago, Chile; [Rodigas, Timothy] Carnegie Inst Sci, Dept Terr Magnetism, Washington, DC 20015 USA; [Schlieder, Joshua] NASA, Ames Res Ctr, Space Sci & Astrobiol Div, Moffett Field, CA 94035 USA; [Udry, Stephane] Univ Geneva, Observ Geneve, CH-1290 Versoix, Switzerland; [Vakili, Farrokh] Univ Nice Sophia Antipolis UNS, CNRS, Lab JL Lagrange, OCA, F-06108 Nice 2, France; [Wisniewski, John] Univ Oklahoma, Dept Phys & Astron, Norman, OK 73019 USA","Boccaletti, A (reprint author), Univ Paris 06, Univ Paris Diderot, CNRS, Observ Paris,LESIA, 5 Pl Jules Janssen, F-92190 Meudon, France.",anthony.boccaletti@obspm.fr,,"Vigan, Arthur/0000-0002-5902-7828; Turatto, Massimo/0000-0002-9719-3157","ESO; CNRS; MPIA; INAF; FINES; NOVA; European Commission FP6 programme as part of OPTICON [RII3-Ct-2004-001566]; European Commission FP7 programme as part of OPTICON [226604, 312430]; Swiss National Science Foundation; SNSF; ESO Very Large Telescope [60.A-9249]; NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope [12228]; NASA [NAS 5-26555];  [ANR-14-CE33-0018]","SPHERE was built by a European consortium led by IPAG (France).

A powerful test-bed for the many-body concepts and methods is the Kondo effect(1,2), which entails the coupling of a quantum impurity to a continuum of states. It is central in highly correlated systems(3-5) and can be explored with tunable nanostructures(6-9). Although Kondo physics is usually associated with the hybridization of itinerant electrons with microscopic magnetic moments(10), theory predicts that it can arise whenever degenerate quantum states are coupled to a continuum(4,11-14). Here we demonstrate the previously elusive 'charge' Kondo effect in a hybrid metal-semiconductor implementation of a single-electron transistor, with a quantum pseudospin of 1/2 constituted by two degenerate macroscopic charge states of a metallic island(11,15-20). In contrast to other Kondo nanostructures, each conduction channel connecting the island to an electrode constitutes a distinct and fully tunable Kondo channel(11), thereby providing unprecedented access to the two-channel Kondo effect and a clear path to multi-channel Kondo physics(1,4,21,22). Using a weakly coupled probe, we find the renormalization flow, as temperature is reduced, of two Kondo channels competing to screen the charge pseudospin. This provides a direct view of how the predicted quantum phase transition develops across the symmetric quantum critical point(4,21). Detuning the pseudospin away from degeneracy, we demonstrate, on a fully characterized device, quantitative agreement with the predictions for the finite-temperature crossover from quantum criticality(17).","[Iftikhar, Z.; Jezouin, S.; Anthore, A.; Gennser, U.; Parmentier, F.

The paradigm is essential for understanding unconventional high-T-c superconductors and the non-Fermi liquid properties of heavy fermion compounds. However, the microscopic origins of quantum phase transitions in complex materials are often debated. Here we demonstrate experimentally, with support from numerical renormalization group calculations, a universal crossover from quantum critical non-Fermi liquid behaviour to distinct Fermi liquid ground states in a highly controllable quantum dot device. Our device realizes the non-Fermi liquid two-channel Kondo state(2,3), based on a spin-1/2 impurity exchange-coupled equally to two independent electronic reservoirs(4). On detuning the exchange couplings we observe the Fermi liquid scale T*, at energies below which the spin is screened conventionally by the more strongly coupled channel. We extract a quadratic dependence of T* on gate voltage close to criticality, and validate an asymptotically exact description of the universal crossover between strongly correlated non-Fermi liquid and Fermi liquid states(5,6).","[Keller, A.

However, owing to their branched structures and the presence of stereogenic centres at each glycosidic linkage between monomers, carbohydrates are harder to characterize than are peptides and oligonucleotides(4). Methods such as nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy can be used to characterize glycosidic linkages, but this technique requires milligram amounts of material and cannot detect small amounts of coexisting isomers(5). Mass spectrometry, on the other hand, can provide information on carbohydrate composition and connectivity for even small amounts of sample, but it cannot be used to distinguish between stereoisomers(6). Here, we demonstrate that ion mobility-mass spectrometry-a method that separates molecules according to their mass, charge, size, and shape-can unambiguously identify carbohydrate linkage-isomers and stereoisomers. We analysed six synthetic carbohydrate isomers that differ in composition, connectivity, or configuration. Our data show that coexisting carbohydrate isomers can be identified, and relative concentrations of the minor isomer as low as 0.1 per cent can be detected. In addition, the analysis is rapid, and requires no derivatization and only small amounts of sample. These results indicate that ion-mobility-mass spectrometry is an effective tool for the analysis of complex carbohydrates. This method could have an impact on the field of carbohydrate synthesis similar to that of the advent of high-performance liquid chromatography on the field of peptide assembly in the late 1970s.","[Hofmann, J.; Pagel, K.] Max Planck Gesell, Fritz Haber Inst, D-14195 Berlin, Germany; [Hofmann, J.; Hahm, H.

The point in history at which this process initiated marks a step-change in the thermal evolution of the planet. Recent computational and experimental studies(1-5) have presented radically differing estimates of the thermal conductivity of the Earth's core, resulting in estimates of the timing of inner-core nucleation ranging from less than half a billion to nearly two billion years ago. Recent inner-core nucleation (high thermal conductivity) requires high outer-core temperatures in the early Earth that complicate models of thermal evolution. The nucleation of the core leads to a different convective regime(6) and potentially different magnetic field structures that produce an observable signal in the palaeomagnetic record and allow the date of inner-core nucleation to be estimated directly. Previous studies searching for this signature have been hampered by the paucity of palaeomagnetic intensity measurements, by the lack of an effective means of assessing their reliability, and by shorter-timescale geo-magnetic variations. Here we examine results from an expanded Precambrian database of palaeomagnetic intensity measurements(7) selected using a new set of reliability criteria(8). Our analysis provides intensity-based support for the dominant dipolarity of the time-averaged Precambrian field, a crucial requirement for palaeomagnetic reconstructions of continents. We also present firm evidence for the existence of very long-term variations in geomagnetic strength. The most prominent and robust transition in the record is an increase in both average field strength and variability that is observed to occur between a billion and 1.5 billion years ago. This observation is most readily explained by the nucleation of the inner core occurring during this interval(9); the timing would tend to favour a modest value of core thermal conductivity and supports a simple thermal evolution model for the Earth.","[Biggin, A.

In particular, mothers in good condition in polygynous and dimorphic species are predicted to produce an excess of sons, whereas mothers in poor condition should do the opposite. Despite the elegance of the theory, support for it has been limited(2,3). Here we extend and generalize the Trivers-Willard theory to explain the disparity between predictions and observations of offspring sex ratio. In polygynous species, males typically have higher mortality rates(4), different age-specific reproductive schedules and more risk-prone life history tactics than females; however, these differences are not currently incorporated into the Trivers-Willard theory. Using two-sex models parameterized with data from free-living mammal populations with contrasting levels of sex differences in demography, we demonstrate how sex differences in life history traits over the entire lifespan can lead to a wide range of sex allocation tactics, and show that correlations between maternal condition and offspring sex ratio alone are insufficient to conclude that mothers adaptively adjust offspring sex ratio.","[Schindler, Susanne; Coulson, Tim] Univ Oxford, Dept Zool, Oxford OX1 3PS, England; [Gaillard, Jean-Michel] Univ Lyon 1, UMR 5558, Lab Biometrie & Biol Evolut, F-69622 Villeurbanne, France; [Gruening, Andre] Univ Surrey, Dept Comp Sci, Guildford GU2 7XH, Surrey, England; [Neuhaus, Peter] Univ Calgary, Dept Biol Sci, Calgary, AB T2N 1N4, Canada; [Traill, Lochran W.] Univ Witwatersrand, Sch Anim Plant & Environm Sci, ZA-2050 Johannesburg, South Africa; [Tuljapurkar, Shripad] Stanford Univ, Dept Biol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA","Schindler, S (reprint author), Univ Oxford, Dept Zool, Oxford OX1 3PS, England.",Susanne.Schindler@zoo.ox.ac.uk,,"Coulson, Tim/0000-0001-9371-9003",ERC Advanced Grant; Swiss National Science Foundation [SNF 3100AO-109816]; European Commission (Marie Curie Fellowship) [254442]; Carnegie Corporation of New York [B8749.R01],"We thank Y.

To address this problem, we conducted a multi-centre genome-wide association study (GWAS) of life-threatening Plasmodium falciparum infection (severe malaria) in over 11,000 African children, with replication data in a further 14,000 individuals. Here we report a novel malaria resistance locus close to a cluster of genes encoding glycophorins that are receptors for erythrocyte invasion by P. falciparum. We identify a haplotype at this locus that provides 33% protection against severe malaria (odds ratio = 0.67, 95% confidence interval = 0.60-0.76, P value = 9.5 x 10(-11)) and is linked to polymorphisms that have previously been shown to have features of ancient balancing selection, on the basis of haplotype sharing between humans and chimpanzees(4). Taken together with previous observations on the malaria-protective role of blood group O-1-3,O-5, these data reveal that two of the strongest GWAS signals for severe malaria lie in or close to genes encoding the glycosylated surface coat of the erythrocyte cell membrane, both within regions of the genome where it appears that evolution has maintained diversity for millions of years. These findings provide new insights into the host-parasite interactions that are critical in determining the outcome of malaria infection.","[Band, Gavin; Rockett, Kirk A.; Spencer, Chris C.

In insects, mushroom bodies have been an important model system for studying sparse coding in the olfactory system(1-3), where this format is important for accurate memory formation(4-6). In Drosophila, it has recently been shown that the 2,000 Kenyon cells of the mushroom body converge onto a population of only 34 mushroom body output neurons (MBONs), which fall into 21 anatomically distinct cell types(7,8). Here we provide the first, to our knowledge, comprehensive view of olfactory representations at the fourth layer of the circuit, where we find a clear transition in the principles of sensory coding. We show that MBON tuning curves are highly correlated with one another. This is in sharp contrast to the process of progressive decorrelation of tuning in the earlier layers of the circuit(2,9). Instead, at the population level, odour representations are reformatted so that positive and negative correlations arise between representations of different odours. At the single-cell level, we show that uniquely identifiable MBONs display profoundly different tuning across different animals, but that tuning of the same neuron across the two hemispheres of an individual fly was nearly identical. Thus, individualized coordination of tuning arises at this level of the olfactory circuit. Furthermore, we find that this individualization is an active process that requires a learning-related gene, rutabaga. Ultimately, neural circuits have to flexibly map highly stimulus-specific information in sparse layers onto a limited number of different motor outputs. The reformatting of sensory representations we observe here may mark the beginning of this sensory-motor transition in the olfactory system.","[Hige, Toshihide; Turner, Glenn C.] Cold Spring Harbor Lab, Cold Spring Harbor, NY 11724 USA; [Aso, Yoshinori; Rubin, Gerald M.] Howard Hughes Med Inst, Ashburn, VA 20147 USA","Turner, GC (reprint author), Cold Spring Harbor Lab, POB 100, Cold Spring Harbor, NY 11724 USA.",turner@cshl.edu,,"Rubin, Gerald/0000-0001-8762-8703",NIH [R01 DC010403-01A1]; Postdoctoral Fellowship for Research Abroad from Japan Society for the Promotion of Science; Uehara Memorial Foundation,"We would like to thank V.

In late-stage colorectal cancer, the most commonly used targeted therapies are the monoclonal antibodies cetuximab and panitumumab, which prevent epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) activation(1). Recent studies have identified alterations in KRAS(2-4) and other genes(5-13) as likely mechanisms of primary and secondary resistance to anti-EGFR antibody therapy. Despite these efforts, additional mechanisms of resistance to EGFR blockade are thought to be present in colorectal cancer and little is known about determinants of sensitivity to this therapy. To examine the effect of somatic genetic changes in colorectal cancer on response to anti-EGFR antibody therapy, here we perform complete exome sequence and copy number analyses of 129 patient-derived tumour grafts and targeted genomic analyses of 55 patient tumours, all of which were KRAS wild-type. We analysed the response of tumours to anti-EGFR antibody blockade in tumour graft models and in clinical settings and functionally linked therapeutic responses to mutational data. In addition to previously identified genes, we detected mutations in ERBB2, EGFR, FGFR1, PDGFRA, and MAP2K1 as potential mechanisms of primary resistance to this therapy. Novel alterations in the ectodomain of EGFR were identified in patients with acquired resistance to EGFR blockade. Amplifications and sequence changes in the tyrosine kinase receptor adaptor gene IRS2 were identified in tumours with increased sensitivity to anti-EGFR therapy. Therapeutic resistance to EGFR blockade could be overcome in tumour graft models through combinatorial therapies targeting actionable genes. These analyses provide a systematic approach to evaluating response to targeted therapies in human cancer, highlight new mechanisms of responsiveness to anti-EGFR therapies, and delineate new avenues for intervention in managing colorectal cancer.","[Bertotti, Andrea; Lupo, Barbara; Migliardi, Giorgia; Zanella, Eugenia R.; Trusolino, Livio] Univ Turin, Sch Med, Dept Oncol, I-10060 Turin, Italy; [Bertotti, Andrea; Lupo, Barbara; Sassi, Francesco; Cottino, Francesca; Migliardi, Giorgia; Zanella, Eugenia R.; Mellano, Alfredo; Muratore, Andrea; Marsoni, Silvia; Trusolino, Livio] Fdn Piemonte Oncol IRCCS, Candiolo Canc Inst, Translat Canc Med Surg Oncol & Clin Trials Coord, I-10060 Turin, Italy; [Bertotti, Andrea] Natl Inst Biostruct & Biosyst INBB, I-00136 Rome, Italy; [Papp, Eniko; Adleff, Vilmos; Anagnostou, Valsamo; Phallen, Jillian; Hruban, Carolyn A.; Li, Qing Kay; Karchin, Rachel; Scharpf, Robert; Diaz, Luis A., Jr.; Velculescu, Victor E.] Johns Hopkins Univ, Sch Med, Sidney Kimmel Comprehens Canc Ctr, Baltimore, MD 21287 USA; [Jones, Sian; Sausen, Mark; Nesselbush, Monica; Lytle, Karli] Personal Genome Diagnost, Baltimore, MD 21224 USA; [Tokheim, Collin; Niknafs, Noushin; Karchin, Rachel] Johns Hopkins Univ, Inst Computat Med, Dept Biomed Engn, Baltimore, MD 21204 USA; [Ribero, Dario; Russolillo, Nadia] Mauriziano Umberto Hosp, Dept Surg, I-10128 Turin, Italy; [Paraluppi, Gianluca; Salizzoni, Mauro] San Giovanni Battista Hosp, Liver Transplantat Ctr, I-10126 Turin, Italy; [Salizzoni, Mauro] Univ Turin, Sch Med, Dept Surg Sci, I-10126 Turin, Italy; [Kragh, Michael; Lantto, Johan] Symphogen AS, DK-2750 Ballerup, Denmark; [Cassingena, Andrea; Sartore-Bianchi, Andrea; Siena, Salvatore] Osped Niguarda Ca Granda, Niguarda Canc Ctr, I-20162 Milan, Italy; [Siena, Salvatore] Univ Milan, Sch Med, I-20162 Milan, Italy; [Diaz, Luis A., Jr.] Johns Hopkins, Ludwig Ctr Canc Genet & Therapeut, Swim Amer Lab, Baltimore, MD 21287 USA","Velculescu, VE (reprint author), Johns Hopkins Univ, Sch Med, Sidney Kimmel Comprehens Canc Ctr, Baltimore, MD 21287 USA.",andrea.bertotti@ircc.it; livio.trusolino@ircc.it; velculescu@jhmi.edu,,"Marsoni, Silvia/0000-0002-5361-7122; Sartore Bianchi, Andrea/0000-0003-0780-0409; SIENA, SALVATORE/0000-0002-2681-2846; Velculescu, Victor/0000-0003-1195-438X","John G.

Although extensive studies have identified many mutations affecting cell size, the molecular mechanisms underlying size control have remained elusive(3). In the budding yeast Saccharomyces cere-visiae, size control occurs in G1 phase before Start, the point of irreversible commitment to cell division(4,5). It was previously thought that activity of the G1 cyclin Cln3 increased with cell size to trigger Start by initiating the inhibition of the transcriptional inhibitor Whi5 (refs 6-8). Here we show that although Cln3 concentration does modulate the rate at which cells pass Start, its synthesis increases in proportion to cell size so that its total concentration is nearly constant during pre-Start G1. Rather than increasing Cln3 activity, we identify decreasing Whi5 activity-due to the dilution of Whi5 by cell growth-as a molecular mechanism through which cell size controls proliferation. Whi5 is synthesized in S/G2/M phases of the cell cycle in a largely size-independent manner. This results in smaller daughter cells being born with higher Whi5 concentrations that extend their pre-Start G1 phase. Thus, at its most fundamental level, size control in budding yeast results from the differential scaling of Cln3 and Whi5 synthesis rates with cell size. More generally, our work shows that differential size-dependency of protein synthesis can provide an elegant mechanism to coordinate cellular functions with growth.","[Schmoller, Kurt M.; Turner, J.

Here we show that the Mediator-associated kinases cyclin-dependent kinase 8 (CDK8) and CDK19 restrain increased activation of key SE-associated genes in acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) cells. We report that the natural product cortistatin A (CA) selectively inhibits Mediator kinases, has anti-leukaemic activity in vitro and in vivo, and disproportionately induces upregulation of SE-associated genes in CA-sensitiveAML cell lines but not in CA-insensitive cell lines. In AML cells, CA upregulated SE-associated genes with tumour suppressor and lineage-controlling functions, including the transcription factors CEBPA, IRF8, IRF1 and ETV6 (refs 6-8). The BRD4 inhibitor I-BET151 downregulated these SE-associated genes, yet also has anti-leukaemic activity. Individually increasing or decreasing the expression of these transcription factors suppressed AML cell growth, providing evidence that leukaemia cells are sensitive to the dosage of SE-associated genes. Our results demonstrate that Mediator kinases can negatively regulate SE-associated gene expression in specific cell types, and can be pharmacologically targeted as a therapeutic approach to AML.","[Pelish, Henry E.; Liau, Brian B.; Nitulescu, Ioana I.; Tangpeerachaikul, Anupong; Da Silva, Diogo H.; Caruso, Brittany T.; Arefolov, Alexander; Fadeyi, Olugbeminiyi; Du, Karrie; Zou, Ge; Si, Chong; Myers, Andrew G.; Shair, Matthew D.] Harvard Univ, Dept Chem & Chem Biol, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Poss, Zachary C.; Ebmeier, Christopher C.; Taatjes, Dylan J.] Univ Colorado, Dept Chem & Biochem, Boulder, CO 80303 USA; [Christie, Amanda L.; Kohl, Nancy E.] Dana Farber Canc Inst, Lurie Family Imaging Ctr, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Banka, Deepti] Childrens Hosp, Div Hematol Oncol, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Schneider, Elisabeth V.; Jestel, Anja] Proteros Biostruct GmbH, D-82152 Martinsried, Germany; [Schneider, Elisabeth V.] Max Planck Inst Biochem, D-82152 Martinsried, Germany; [Bronson, Roderick T.] Dana Farber Canc Inst, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Krivtsov, Andrei V.; Armstrong, Scott A.] Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Canc Biol & Genet Program, New York, NY 10065 USA; [Krivtsov, Andrei V.; Armstrong, Scott A.] Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Dept Pediat, New York, NY 10065 USA; [Kung, Andrew L.] Columbia Univ, Med Ctr, Dept Pediat, New York, NY 10032 USA; [Lemieux, Madeleine E.] Bioinfo, Plantagenet, ON K0B 1L0, Canada","Shair, MD (reprint author), Harvard Univ, Dept Chem & Chem Biol, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",shair@chemistry.harvard.edu,,"Lemieux, Madeleine/0000-0001-6355-8691; Kung, Andrew/0000-0002-9091-488X; Krivtsov, Andrei/0000-0002-5511-1686","NIH [CA66996, T32 GM08759]; NCI [R01 CA170741, F31 CA180419]; Leukemia and Lymphoma Society Translational Research Program; Blavatnik Biomedical Accelerator Programat Harvard; Starr Cancer Consortium;  [P30-CA046934]","We thank R.

Available X-ray structures of prokaryotic and eukaryotic Cys-loop receptors provide tremendous insights into the binding of agonists, the subsequent opening of the ion channel, and the mechanism of channel activation(1-8). Yet the mechanism of inactivation by antagonists remains unknown. Here we present a 3.0 angstrom X-ray structure of the human glycine receptor-alpha 3 homopentamer in complex with a high affinity, high-specificity antagonist, strychnine. Our structure allows us to explore in detail the molecular recognition of antagonists. Comparisons with previous structures reveal a mechanism for antagonist-induced inactivation of Cys-loop receptors, involving an expansion of the orthosteric binding site in the extracellular domain that is coupled to closure of the ion pore in the transmembrane domain.","[Huang, Xin; Michelsen, Klaus; Shaffer, Paul L.] Amgen Inc, Dept Mol Struct & Characterizat, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; [Chen, Hao] Amgen Inc, Dept Prot Technol, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; [Schneider, Stephen] Amgen Inc, Dept Neurosci, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA","Huang, X (reprint author), Amgen Inc, Dept Mol Struct & Characterizat, 360 Binney St, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA.",hxin@amgen.com; pshaffer@amgen.com,,,,,,41,48,49,2,14,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,8-Oct,2015,526,7572,,,,,277,+,,10.1038/nature14972,,14,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,CS9GV,WOS:000362399000052,26416729,No,Y,N,11/19/17

We employ long-time molecular dynamics simulations utilizing a density-functional-theory-validated interatomic potential, and reveal the fundamental origins of the previously unexplained phenomena. Here we show that the key < c+alpha > dislocation (where < c+alpha > indicates the magnitude and direction of slip) is metastable on easy-glide pyramidal II planes; we find that it undergoes a thermally activated, stress-dependent transition to one of three lower-energy, basal-dissociated immobile dislocation structures, which cannot contribute to plastic straining and that serve as strong obstacles to the motion of all other dislocations. This transition is intrinsic to magnesium, driven by reduction in dislocation energy and predicted to occur at very high frequency at room temperature, thus eliminating all major dislocation slip systems able to contribute to c-axis strain and leading to the high hardening and low ductility of magnesium. Enhanced ductility can thus be achieved by increasing the time and temperature at which the transition from the easy-glide metastable dislocation to the immobile basal-dissociated structures occurs. Our results provide the underlying insights needed to guide the design of ductile magnesium alloys.","[Wu, Zhaoxuan; Curtin, W.

Here we report completion of the project, having reconstructed the genomes of 2,504 individuals from 26 populations using a combination of low-coverage whole-genome sequencing, deep exome sequencing, and dense microarray genotyping. We characterized a broad spectrum of genetic variation, in total over 88 million variants (84.7 million single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), 3.6 million short insertions/deletions (indels), and 60,000 structural variants), all phased onto high-quality haplotypes. This resource includes >99% of SNP variants with a frequency of >1% for a variety of ancestries. We describe the distribution of genetic variation across the global sample, and discuss the implications for common disease studies.","[Auton, Adam; Campbell, Christopher L.; Kong, Yu; Marcketta, Anthony; Auton, Adam; Marcketta, Anthony; Auton, Adam] Albert Einstein Coll Med, Dept Genet, Bronx, NY 10461 USA; [Abecasis, Goncalo R.; Goncalo, R.

Here we describe an integrated set of eight structural variant classes comprising both balanced and unbalanced variants, which we constructed using short-read DNA sequencing data and statistically phased onto haplotype blocks in 26 human populations. Analysing this set, we identify numerous gene-intersecting structural variants exhibiting population stratification and describe naturally occurring homozygous gene knockouts that suggest the dispensability of a variety of human genes. We demonstrate that structural variants are enriched on haplotypes identified by genome-wide association studies and exhibit enrichment for expression quantitative trait loci. Additionally, we uncover appreciable levels of structural variant complexity at different scales, including genic loci subject to clusters of repeated rearrangement and complex structural variants with multiple breakpoints likely to have formed through individual mutational events. Our catalogue will enhance future studies into structural variant demography, functional impact and disease association.","[Sudmant, Peter H.; Huddleston, John; Hormozdiari, Fereydoun; Malig, Maika; Chaisson, Mark J.

Here we describe insights from sequencing whole genomes (low read depth, 7x) or exomes (high read depth, 80x) of nearly 10,000 individuals from population-based and disease collections. In extensively phenotyped cohorts we characterize over 24 million novel sequence variants, generate a highly accurate imputation reference panel and identify novel alleles associated with levels of triglycerides (APOB), adiponectin (ADIPOQ) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDLR and RGAG1) from single-marker and rare variant aggregation tests. We describe population structure and functional annotation of rare and low-frequency variants, use the data to estimate the benefits of sequencing for association studies, and summarize lessons from disease-specific collections. Finally, we make available an extensive resource, including individual-level genetic and phenotypic data and web-based tools to facilitate the exploration of association results.","[Walter, Klaudia; Huang, Jie; Crooks, Lucy; Memari, Yasin; McCarthy, Shane; Iotchkova, Valentina; Hendricks, Audrey E.; Danecek, Petr; Floyd, James; Barroso, Ines; Hurles, Matthew E.; Zeggini, Eleftheria; Barrett, Jeffrey C.; Durbin, Richard; Soranzo, Nicole; Bala, Senduran; Coates, Guy; Cox, Tony; Daly, Allan; Edkins, Sarah; Ellis, Peter; Flicek, Paul; Jackson, David K.; Joyce, Chris; Keane, Thomas; Kolb-Kokocinski, Anja; Langford, Cordelia; Maslen, John; Muddyman, Dawn; Quail, Michael A.; Stalker, Jim; Wong, Kim; Chen, Lu; Day-Williams, Aaron; Down, Thomas; Geihs, Matthias; Hubbard, Tim; Lopes, Margarida; Panoutsopoulou, Kalliope; Ritchie, Graham R.

However, such technology faces two major challenges to further scaling. First, the device electrostatics (the ability of the transistor's gate electrode to control its channel potential) are degraded when the channel length is decreased, using conventional bulk materials such as silicon as the channel. Recently, two-dimensional semiconducting materials(1-7) have emerged as promising candidates to replace silicon, as they can maintain excellent device electrostatics even at much reduced channel lengths. The second, more severe, challenge is that the supply voltage can no longer be scaled down by the same factor as the transistor dimensions because of the fundamental thermionic limitation of the steepness of turn-on characteristics, or subthreshold swing(8,9). To enable scaling to continue without a power penalty, a different transistor mechanism is required to obtain subthermionic subthreshold swing, such as band-to-band tunnelling(10-16). Here we demonstrate band-to-band tunnel field-effect transistors (tunnelFETs), based on a two-dimensional semiconductor, that exhibit steep turn-on; subthreshold swing is a minimum of 3.9 millivolts per decade and an average of 31.1 millivolts per decade for four decades of drain current at room temperature. By using highly doped germanium as the source and atomically thin molybdenum disulfide as the channel, a vertical heterostructure is built with excellent electrostatics, a strain-free heterointerface, a lowtunnelling barrier, and a large tunnelling area. Our atomically thin and layered semiconducting-channel tunnel-FET(ATLAS-TFET) is the only planar architecture tunnel-FET to achieve subthermionic subthreshold swing over four decades of drain current, as recommended in ref. 17, and is also the only tunnel-FET(inany architecture) to achieve this at a low power-supply voltage of 0.1 volts. Our device is at present the thinnest-channel subthermionic transistor, and has the potential to open up new avenues for ultra-dense and low-power integrated circuits, as well as for ultra-sensitive biosensors and gas sensors(18-21).","[Sarkar, Deblina; Xie, Xuejun; Liu, Wei; Cao, Wei; Kang, Jiahao; Banerjee, Kaustav] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; [Gong, Yongji; Ajayan, Pulickel M.] Rice Univ, Dept Mat Sci & Nanoengn, Houston, TX 77005 USA; [Kraemer, Stephan] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Mat, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA","Banerjee, K (reprint author), Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA.",kaustav@ece.ucsb.edu,"Liu, Wei/B-3584-2015; Gong, Yongji/L-7628-2016","Xie, Xuejun/0000-0002-1161-3836; Kang, Jiahao/0000-0002-8467-2503",Air Force Office of Scientific Research [FA9550-14-1-0268]; US NSF [CCF-1162633]; Army Research Office (MURI) [W911NF-11-1-0362]; MRSEC Program of the NSF [DMR1121053]; NSF-funded Materials Research Facilities Network,"This work was supported by the Air Force Office of Scientific Research (grant FA9550-14-1-0268) and the US NSF (grant CCF-1162633).

The most common nitrogenases reduce atmospheric N-2 at the FeMo cofactor, a sulfur-rich iron-molybdenum cluster (FeMoco)(1-5). The central iron sites that are coordinated to sulfur and carbon atoms in FeMoco have been proposed to be the substrate binding sites, on the basis of kinetic and spectroscopic studies(5-7). In the resting state, the central iron sites each have bonds to three sulfur atoms and one carbon atom. Addition of electrons to the resting state causes the FeMoco to react with N-2, but the geometry and bonding environment of N-2-bound species remain unknown(5). Here we describe a synthetic complex with a sulfur-rich coordination sphere that, upon reduction, breaks an Fe-S bond and binds N-2. The product is the first synthetic Fe-N-2 complex in which iron has bonds to sulfur and carbon atoms, providing a model for N-2 coordination in the FeMoco. Our results demonstrate that breaking an Fe-S bond is a chemically reasonable route to N-2 binding in the FeMoco, and show structural and spectroscopic details for weakened N-2 on a sulfur-rich iron site.","[Coric, Ilija; Mercado, Brandon Q.; Vinyard, David J.; Holland, Patrick L.] Yale Univ, Dept Chem, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Bill, Eckhard] Max Planck Inst Chem Energy Convers, D-45470 Mulheim, Germany","Holland, PL (reprint author), Yale Univ, Dept Chem, 225 Prospect St, New Haven, CT 06520 USA.",patrick.holland@yale.edu,,"Coric, Ilija/0000-0002-0435-1313","National Institutes of Health [GM065313]; Max Planck Society; NSF [CHE-0650456, CNS 08-21132]","This work was supported by the National Institutes of Health (GM065313 to P.L.H.) and the Max Planck Society (E.B.).

In many tectonically active mountain ranges, glaciers have been inferred to be highly erosive, and conditions of glaciation are used to explain both the marked relief typical of alpine settings and the limit on mountain heights above the snowline, that is, the glacial buzzsaw(1). In other high-latitude regions, glacial erosion is presumed to be minimal, where a mantle of cold ice effectively protects landscapes from erosion(2-4). Glacial erosion rates are expected to increase with decreasing latitude, owing to the climatic control on basal temperature and the production of meltwater, which promotes glacial sliding, erosion and sediment transfer. This relationship between climate, glacier dynamics and erosion rate is the focus of recent numerical modelling(5-8), yet it is qualitative and lacks an empirical database. Here we present a comprehensive data set that permits explicit examination of the factors controlling glacier erosion across climatic regimes. We report contemporary ice fluxes, sliding speeds and erosion rates inferred from sediment yields from 15 outlet glaciers spanning 19 degrees of latitude from Patagonia to the Antarctic Peninsula. Although this broad region has a relatively uniform tectonic and geologic history, the thermal regimes of its glaciers range from temperate to polar. We find that basin-averaged erosion rates vary by three orders of magnitude over this latitudinal transect. Our findings imply that climate and the glacier thermal regime control erosion rates more than do extent of ice cover, ice flux or sliding speeds.","[Koppes, Michele] Univ British Columbia, Dept Geog, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z2, Canada; [Hallet, Bernard] Univ Washington, Dept Earth & Space Sci, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Hallet, Bernard] Univ Washington, Quaternary Res Ctr, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Rignot, Eric; Mouginot, Jeremie] Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Earth Syst Sci, Irvine, CA 92617 USA; [Rignot, Eric] NASA, Jet Prop Lab, Pasadena, CA 91109 USA; [Wellner, Julia Smith] Univ Houston, Dept Earth & Atmospher Sci, Houston, TX 77204 USA; [Boldt, Katherine] Univ Washington, Sch Oceanog, Seattle, WA 98195 USA","Koppes, M (reprint author), Univ British Columbia, Dept Geog, 1984 West Mall, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z2, Canada.",koppes@geog.ubc.ca,"Mouginot, Jeremie/G-7045-2015; Rignot, Eric/A-4560-2014","Mouginot, Jeremie/0000-0001-9155-5455; Rignot, Eric/0000-0002-3366-0481",US National Science Foundation [OPP 0338371],"This research was funded by the US National Science Foundation (OPP 0338371).

Many deciduous tree species require chilling for dormancy release, and warming-related reductions in chillingmay counteract the advance of leaf unfolding in response to warming(5,6). Empirical evidence for this, however, is limited to saplings or twigs in climate-controlled chambers(7,8). Using long-termin situ observations of leaf unfolding for seven dominant European tree species at 1,245 sites, here we show that the apparent response of leaf unfolding to climate warming (S-T, expressed in days advance of leaf unfolding per degrees C warming) has significantly decreased from 1980 to 2013 in all monitored tree species. Averaged across all species and sites, S-T decreased by 40% from 4.0 +/- 1.8 days degrees C-1 during 1980-1994 to 2.3 +/- 1.6 days degrees C-1 during 1999-2013. The declining S-T was also simulated by chilling-based phenology models, albeit with a weaker decline (24-30%) than observedin situ. The reduction in S-T is likely to be partly attributable to reduced chilling. Nonetheless, other mechanisms may also have a role, such as 'photo-period limitation' mechanisms that may become ultimately limiting when leaf unfolding dates occur too early in the season.

Enamel deposition requires an organic matrix containing the unique enamel matrix proteins (EMPs) amelogenin (AMEL), enamelin (ENAM) and ameloblastin (AMBN)(6). Chondrichthyans (cartilaginous fishes) lack both enamel and EMP genes(7,8). Many fossil and a few living non-teleost actinopterygians (ray-finned bony fishes) such as the gar, Lepisosteus, have scales and dermal bones covered with a proposed enamel homologue called ganoine(1,9). However, no gene or transcript data for EMPs have been described from actinopterygians(10,11). Here we show that Psarolepis romeri, a bony fish from the the Early Devonian period, combines enamel-covered dermal odontodes on scales and skull bones with teeth of naked dentine, and that Lepisosteus oculatus (the spotted gar) has enam andambn genes that are expressed in the skin, probably associated with ganoine formation. The genetic evidence strengthens the hypothesis that ganoine is homologous with enamel. The fossil evidence, further supported by the Silurian bony fish Andreolepis, which has enamel-covered scales but teeth and odontodes on its dermal bones made of naked dentine(12-16), indicates that this tissue originated on the dermal skeleton, probably on the scales. It subsequently underwent heterotopic expansion across two highly conserved patterning boundaries (scales/head-shoulder and dermal/oral) within the odontode skeleton.","[Qu, Qingming; Haitina, Tatjana; Ahlberg, Per Erik] Uppsala Univ, Dept Organismal Biol, Subdept Evolut & Dev, SE-75236 Uppsala, Sweden; [Zhu, Min] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Vertebrate Paleontol & Paleoanthropol, Key Lab Vertebrate Evolut & Human Origins, Beijing 100044, Peoples R China","Ahlberg, PE (reprint author), Uppsala Univ, Dept Organismal Biol, Subdept Evolut & Dev, Norbyvagen 18A, SE-75236 Uppsala, Sweden.",per.ahlberg@ebc.uu.se,,,Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation; Vetenskapsradet (Swedish Research Council); National Basic Research Programme of China [2012CB821902],"This project was inspired in part by initial discussions with K.

Bone mineral density (BMD) is highly heritable, a major predictor of osteoporotic fractures, and has been previously associated with common genetic variants(1-8), as well as rare, population specific, coding variants(9). Here we identify novel non-coding genetic variants with large effects on BMD (n(total) = 53,236) and fracture (n(total) = 508,253) in individuals of European ancestry from the general population. Associations for BMD were derived from whole-genome sequencing (n = 2,882 from UK10K (ref. 10); a population-based genome sequencing consortium), whole-exome sequencing (n = 3,549), deep imputation of genotyped samples using a combined UK10K/1000 Genomes reference panel (n = 26,534), and de novo replication genotyping (n = 20,271). We identified a low-frequency non-coding variant near a novel locus, EN1, with an effect size fourfold larger than the mean of previously reported common variants for lumbar spine BMD8 (rs11692564(T), MAF51.6%, replication effect size510.20 s.d., P-meta = 2 x 10(-14)), which was also associated with a decreased risk of fracture (odds ratio = 0.85; P = 2 x 10(-11); ncases = 98,742 and ncontrols = 409,511). Using an En1cre/flox mouse model, we observed that conditional loss of En1 results in low bone mass, probably as a consequence of high bone turnover. We also identified a novel low frequency non-coding variant with large effects on BMD near WNT16 (rs148771817(T), MAF = 1.2%, replication effect size +10.41 s.d., P-meta = 1 x 10(-11)). In general, there was an excess of association signals arising from deleterious coding and conserved non-coding variants. These findings provide evidence that low-frequency non-coding variants have large effects on BMD and fracture, thereby providing rationale for whole-genome sequencing and improved imputation reference panels to study the genetic architecture of complex traits and disease in the general population.","[Zheng, Hou-Feng; Forgetta, Vincenzo; Li, Rui; Richards, J.

Despite the advances in bottom-up nanoengineering and surface chemistry, reductionist functionalization approaches remain inadequate in replicating the complex interfaces present in nature and cannot avoid exposure of foreign materials. Here we report on the preparation of polymeric nanoparticles enclosed in the plasma membrane of human platelets, which are a unique population of cellular fragments that adhere to a variety of disease-relevant substrates(4-7). The resulting nanoparticles possess a right-side-out unilamellar membrane coating functionalized with immunomodulatory and adhesion antigens associated with platelets. Compared to uncoated particles, the platelet membrane-cloaked nanoparticles have reduced cellular uptake by macrophage-like cells and lack particle-induced complement activation in autologous human plasma. The cloaked nanoparticles also display platelet-mimicking properties such as selective adhesion to damaged human and rodent vasculatures as well as enhanced binding to platelet-adhering pathogens. In an experimental rat model of coronary restenosis and a mouse model of systemic bacterial infection, docetaxel and vancomycin, respectively, show enhanced therapeutic efficacy when delivered by the platelet-mimetic nanoparticles. The multifaceted biointerfacing enabled by the platelet membrane cloaking method provides a new approach in developing functional nanoparticles for disease-targeted delivery.","[Hu, Che-Ming J.; Fang, Ronnie H.; Thamphiwatana, Soracha; Dehaini, Diana; Angsantikul, Pavimol; Kroll, Ashley V.; Carpenter, Cody; Ramesh, Manikantan; Qu, Vivian; Gao, Weiwei; Zhang, Kang; Zhang, Liangfang] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept NanoEngn, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Hu, Che-Ming J.; Fang, Ronnie H.; Luk, Brian T.; Thamphiwatana, Soracha; Dehaini, Diana; Angsantikul, Pavimol; Kroll, Ashley V.; Gao, Weiwei; Zhang, Liangfang] Univ Calif San Diego, Moores Canc Ctr, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Wang, Kuei-Chun; Luk, Brian T.; Phu Nguyen; Chien, Shu] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Bioengn, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Wang, Kuei-Chun; Phu Nguyen; Zhang, Kang; Chien, Shu; Zhang, Liangfang] Univ Calif San Diego, Inst Engn Med, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Wen, Cindy H.; Patel, Sherrina H.; Zhu, Jie; Zhang, Kang] Univ Calif San Diego, Shiley Eye Inst, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Hofman, Florence M.; Chen, Thomas C.] Univ So Calif, Keck Sch Med, Dept Pathol, Los Angeles, CA 90033 USA; [Zhang, Kang] Vet Adm Healthcare Syst, San Diego, CA 92093 USA","Zhang, LF (reprint author), Univ Calif San Diego, Dept NanoEngn, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.",kang.zhang@gmail.com; shuchien@ucsd.edu; zhang@ucsd.edu,"Wang, Kuei-Chun/N-3089-2017; Wang, Kuei-Chun (Mark)/N-3419-2017",,"National Institutes of Health [R01DK095168, R01HL108735, R01EY25090]; Defense Threat Reduction Agency Joint Science and Technology Office for Chemical and Biological Defense [HDTRA1-14-1-0064]; National Institutes of Health from the National Cancer Institute [R25CA153915]","This work is supported by the National Institutes of Health under Award Numbers R01DK095168 (L.Z.), R01HL108735 (S.C.) and R01EY25090 (K.Z.), and partially by the Defense Threat Reduction Agency Joint Science and Technology Office for Chemical and Biological Defense under Grant Number HDTRA1-14-1-0064 (L.Z.).

Their epidemiological success relies on airborne transmission from person to person; however, the viral properties governing airborne transmission of influenza A viruses are complex. Influenza A virus infection is mediated via binding of the viral haemagglutinin (HA) to terminally attached alpha 2,3 or alpha 2,6 sialic acids on cell surface glycoproteins. Human influenza A viruses preferentially bind alpha 2,6-linked sialic acids whereas avian influenza A viruses bind alpha 2,3-linked sialic acids on complex glycans on airway epithelial cells(1,2). Historically, influenza A viruses with preferential association with alpha 2,3-linked sialic acids have not been transmitted efficiently by the airborne route in ferrets(3,4). Here we observe efficient airborne transmission of a 2009 pandemic H1N1 (H1N1pdm) virus (A/California/07/2009) engineered to preferentially bind alpha 2,3-linked sialic acids. Airborne transmission was associated with rapid selection of virus with a change at a single HA site that conferred binding to long-chain alpha 2,6-linked sialic acids, without loss of alpha 2,3-linked sialic acid binding. The transmissible virus emerged in experimentally infected ferrets within 24 hours after infection and was remarkably enriched in the soft palate, where long-chain alpha 2,6-linked sialic acids predominate on the nasopharyngeal surface. Notably, presence of long-chain alpha 2,6-linked sialic acids is conserved in ferret, pig and human soft palate. Using a loss-of-function approach with this one virus, we demonstrate that the ferret soft palate, a tissue not normally sampled in animal models of influenza, rapidly selects for transmissible influenza A viruses with human receptor (alpha 2,6-linked sialic acids) preference.","[Lakdawala, Seema S.; Lamirande, Elaine W.; Shih, Angela R.; Hanson, Christopher T.; Vogel, Leatrice; Paskel, Myeisha; Subbarao, Kanta] NIAID, Infect Dis Lab, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Jayaraman, Akila; Sasisekharan, Ram] MIT, Dept Biol Engn, Koch Inst Integrat Canc Res, Singapore MIT Alliance Res & Technol, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Halpin, Rebecca A.; Stockwell, Timothy B.; Lin, Xudong; Simenauer, Ari; Das, Suman R.; Wentworth, David E.] J Craig Venter Inst, Rockville, MD 20850 USA; [Minai, Mahnaz; Moore, Ian; Orandle, Marlene] NIAID, Comparat Med Branch, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA","Sasisekharan, R (reprint author), MIT, Dept Biol Engn, Koch Inst Integrat Canc Res, Singapore MIT Alliance Res & Technol, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",rams@mit.edu; ksubbarao@niaid.nih.gov,,"Wentworth, David/0000-0002-5190-980X; Subbarao, Kanta/0000-0003-1713-3056","Intramural Research Program of NIAID, NIH; NIAID, NIH, DHHS [HHSN272200900007C]; NIAID/NIH Genomic Centers for Infectious Diseases (GCID) program [U19-AI-110819]; NIH Merit Award [R37 GM057073-13]; National Research Foundation supported Interdisciplinary Research group in Infectious Diseases of SMART (Singapore MIT alliance for Research and Technology); Skolkovo Foundation","This research was supported in part by the Intramural Research Program of NIAID, NIH and with federal funds from NIAID, NIH, DHHS under contract number HHSN272200900007C and NIAID/NIH Genomic Centers for Infectious Diseases (GCID) program (U19-AI-110819).

HSCs are rare and few can be found in thin tissue sections(2,3) or upon live imaging(4), making it difficult to comprehensively localize dividing and non-dividing HSCs. Here, using a green fluorescent protein (GFP) knock-in for the gene Ctnnal1 in mice (hereafter denoted as alpha-catulin(GFP)), we discover that alpha-catulin(GFP) is expressed by only 0.02% of bone marrow haematopoietic cells, including almost all HSCs. We find that approximately 30% of alpha-catulin-GFP(+)c-kit(+) cells give long-term multilineage reconstitution of irradiated mice, indicating that alpha-catulin-GFP(+)c-kit(+) cells are comparable in HSC purity to cells obtained using the best markers currently available. We optically cleared the bone marrow to perform deep confocal imaging, allowing us to image thousands of alpha-catulin-GFP(+)c-kit(+) cells and to digitally reconstruct large segments of bone marrow. The distribution of alpha-catulin-GFP(+)c-kit(+) cells indicated that HSCs were more common in central marrow than near bone surfaces, and in the diaphysis relative to the metaphysis. Nearly all HSCs contacted leptin receptor positive (Lepr(+)) and Cxcl12(high) niche cells, and approximately 85% of HSCs were within 10 mm of a sinusoidal blood vessel. Most HSCs, both dividing (Ki-67(+)) and non-dividing (Ki-67(-)), were distant from arterioles, transition zone vessels, and bone surfaces. Dividing and non-dividing HSCs thus reside mainly in perisinusoidal niches with Lepr(+)Cxcl12(high) cells throughout the bone marrow.","[Kocherlakota, Kiranmai S.; Morrison, Sean J.] Univ Texas SW Med Ctr Dallas, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Dallas, TX 75390 USA; [Acar, Melih; Kocherlakota, Kiranmai S.; Murphy, Malea M.; Peyer, James G.; Oguro, Hideyuki; Inra, Christopher N.; Jaiyeola, Christabel; Zhao, Zhiyu; Morrison, Sean J.] Univ Texas SW Med Ctr Dallas, Childrens Res Inst, Dallas, TX 75390 USA; [Acar, Melih; Kocherlakota, Kiranmai S.; Murphy, Malea M.; Peyer, James G.; Oguro, Hideyuki; Inra, Christopher N.; Jaiyeola, Christabel; Zhao, Zhiyu; Morrison, Sean J.] Univ Texas SW Med Ctr Dallas, Dept Pediat, Dallas, TX 75390 USA; [Luby-Phelps, Katherine] Univ Texas SW Med Ctr Dallas, Dept Cell Biol, Dallas, TX 75390 USA","Morrison, SJ (reprint author), Univ Texas SW Med Ctr Dallas, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Dallas, TX 75390 USA.",sean.morrison@utsouthwestern.edu,,"Morrison, Sean/0000-0003-1587-8329; Oguro, Hideyuki/0000-0002-9070-4575",National Research Service Award from NIH; NIH NHLBI [HL097760]; NIH Shared Instrumentation grant [NIH S10RR029731],"S.J.M. is a Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator, the Mary McDermott Cook Chair in Pediatric Genetics, the director of the Hamon Laboratory for Stem Cells and Cancer, and a Cancer Prevention and Research Institute of Texas Scholar.

Understanding metastasis initiation and progression is critical to developing new therapeutic strategies to treat and prevent metastatic disease. Prevailing theories hypothesize that metastases are seeded by rare tumour cells with unique properties, which may function like stem cells in their ability to initiate and propagate metastatic tumours(2-5). However, the identity of metastasis-initiating cells in human breast cancer remains elusive, and whether metastases are hierarchically organized is unknown(2). Here we show at the single-cell level that early stage metastatic cells possess a distinct stem-like gene expression signature. To identify and isolate metastatic cells from patient-derived xenograft models of human breast cancer, we developed a highly sensitive fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS)-based assay, which allowed us to enumerate metastatic cells in mouse peripheral tissues. We compared gene signatures in metastatic cells from tissues with low versus high metastatic burden. Metastatic cells from low-burden tissues were distinct owing to their increased expression of stem cell, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, pro-survival, and dormancy-associated genes. By contrast, metastatic cells from high-burden tissues were similar to primary tumour cells, which were more heterogeneous and expressed higher levels of luminal differentiation genes. Transplantation of stem-like metastatic cells from low-burden tissues showed that they have considerable tumour-initiating capacity, and can differentiate to produce luminal-like cancer cells. Progression to high metastatic burden was associated with increased proliferation and MYC expression, which could be attenuated by treatment with cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitors. These findings support a hierarchical model for metastasis, in which metastases are initiated by stem-like cells that proliferate and differentiate to produce advanced metastatic disease.","[Lawson, Devon A.; Kessenbrock, Kai; Prummel, Karin D.; Yu, Ying; Takai, Ken; Wang, Chih-Yang; Werb, Zena] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Anat, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; [Bhakta, Nirav R.; Goga, Andrei] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Med, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; [Kessenbrock, Kai; Zhou, Alicia; Eyob, Henok; Balakrishnan, Sanjeev; Goga, Andrei] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Cell & Tissue Biol, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; [Wang, Chih-Yang] Natl Cheng Kung Univ, Coll Med, Inst Basic Med Sci, Tainan 70101, Taiwan; [Yaswen, Paul] Univ Calif Berkeley, Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Dept Cell & Mol Biol, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA","Werb, Z (reprint author), Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Anat, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA.",andrei.goga@ucsf.edu; zena.werb@ucsf.edu,,,"National Cancer Institute [CA180039, CA136717]; Stand Up To Cancer/AACR [DT0409]; Era of Hope Scholar Award [W81XWH-12-1-0272]; Breast Cancer Research Foundation; Atwater Foundation; US Department of Defense Congressionally Directed Medical Research Program postdoctoral fellowship [11-1-0742]; Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan [104-2917-I-006-002]","We thank A.

Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) and the CRISPR-associated (cas) genes comprise an adaptive immune system that is one of the most widespread means by which bacteria defend themselves against phages(1-3). We identified the first examples of proteins produced by phages that inhibit a CRISPR-Cas system(4). Here we performed biochemical and in vivo investigations of three of these anti-CRISPR proteins, and show that each inhibits CRISPR-Cas activity through a distinct mechanism. Two block the DNA-binding activity of the CRISPR-Cas complex, yet do this by interacting with different protein subunits, and using steric or non-steric modes of inhibition. The third anti-CRISPR protein operates by binding to the Cas3 helicase-nuclease and preventing its recruitment to the DNA-bound CRISPR-Cas complex. In vivo, this anti-CRISPR can convert the CRISPR-Cas system into a transcriptional repressor, providing the first example-to our knowledge-of modulation of CRISPR-Cas activity by a protein interactor. The diverse sequences and mechanisms of action of these anti-CRISPR proteins imply an independent evolution, and foreshadow the existence of other means by which proteins may alter CRISPR-Cas function.","[Bondy-Denomy, Joseph; Garcia, Bianca; Du, Mingjian; Hidalgo-Reyes, Yurima; Davidson, Alan R.] Univ Toronto, Dept Mol Genet, Toronto, ON M5S 1A8, Canada; [Strum, Scott; Davidson, Alan R.] Univ Toronto, Dept Biochem, Toronto, ON M5S 1A8, Canada; [Rollins, MaryClare F.; Wiedenheft, Blake] Montana State Univ, Dept Microbiol & Immunol, Bozeman, MT 59717 USA; [Maxwell, Karen L.] Univ Toronto, Donnelly Ctr Cellular & Biomol Res, Toronto, ON M5S 3E1, Canada","Davidson, AR (reprint author), Univ Toronto, Dept Mol Genet, 100 Coll St, Toronto, ON M5S 1A8, Canada.",karen.maxwell@utoronto.ca; alan.davidson@utoronto.ca,,,"Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR) [MOP-130482, MOP-136845]; CIHR Canada Graduate Scholarship Doctoral Award; Ontario Graduate Scholarship award; National Institutes of Health [R01GM108888, P20GM103500]; National Science Foundation EPSCoR [EPS-110134]; M.J.

Determining their 110-megadalton structure imposes a formidable challenge and requires in situ structural biology approaches. Of approximately 30 nucleoporins (Nups), 15 are structured and form the Y and innerring complexes. These two major scaffolding modules assemble in multiple copies into an eight-fold rotationally symmetric structure that fuses the inner and outer nuclear membranes to forma central channel of similar to 60 nm in diameter(1). The scaffold is decorated with transport-channel Nups that often contain phenylalanine-repeat sequences and mediate the interaction with cargo complexes. Although the architectural arrangement of parts of the Y complex has been elucidated, it is unclear how exactly it oligomerizes in situ. Here we combine cryo-electron tomography with mass spectrometry, biochemical analysis, perturbation experiments and structural modelling to generate, to our knowledge, the most comprehensive architectural model of the human nuclear pore complex to date. Our data suggest previously unknown protein interfaces across Y complexes and to inner-ring complex members. We show that the transport-channel Nup358 (also known as Ranbp2) has a previously unanticipated role in Y-complex oligomerization. Our findings blur the established boundaries between scaffold and transport-channel Nups. We conclude that, similar to coated vesicles, several copies of the same structural building block-although compositionally identical-engage in different local sets of interactions and conformations.","[von Appen, Alexander; Kosinski, Jan; Sparks, Lenore; Ori, Alessandro; Mackmull, Marie-Therese; Banterle, Niccolo; Parca, Luca; Kastritis, Panagiotis; Buczak, Katarzyna; Mosalaganti, Shyamal; Hagen, Wim; Andres-Pons, Amparo; Lemke, Edward A.; Bork, Peer; Bui, Khanh Huy; Beck, Martin] European Mol Biol Lab, Struct & Computat Biol Unit, D-69117 Heidelberg, Germany; [DiGuilio, Amanda L.; Glavy, Joseph S.] Stevens Inst Technol, Dept Chem Chem Biol & Biomed Engn, Hoboken, NJ 07030 USA; [Vollmer, Benjamin; Antonin, Wolfram] Max Planck Gesell, Friedrich Miescher Lab, D-72076 Tubingen, Germany; [Bui, Khanh Huy] McGill Univ, Dept Anat & Cell Biol, Montreal, PQ H3A 0C7, Canada","Bui, KH (reprint author), European Mol Biol Lab, Struct & Computat Biol Unit, D-69117 Heidelberg, Germany.",huy.bui@mcgill.ca; martin.beck@embl.de,"; Beck, Martin/B-5589-2011; Ori, Alessandro/B-7067-2011; Kastritis, Panagiotis/F-2498-2010; Antonin, Wolfram/A-8656-2014","Bui, Khanh Huy/0000-0003-2814-9889; Hagen, Wim/0000-0001-6229-2692; Lemke, Edward/0000-0002-0634-0503; Bork, Peer/0000-0002-2627-833X; Vollmer, Benjamin/0000-0002-7526-0582; Beck, Martin/0000-0002-7397-1321; Ori, Alessandro/0000-0002-3046-0871; Antonin, Wolfram/0000-0003-4669-379X; Banterle, Niccolo/0000-0002-1607-0324; Parca, Luca/0000-0002-0924-8518; Kosinski, Jan/0000-0002-3641-0322; Andres-Pons, Amparo/0000-0001-5801-4024; Kastritis, Panagiotis/0000-0002-1463-8422",EMBL's mechanical workshop; Electron Microscopy and Proteomics Core Facilities; Centre for Statistical Data Analysis; Swiss National Science Foundation; European Molecular Biology Organization; Marie Curie Actions; Alexander von Humboldt Foundation; Robert Crooks Stanley Fellowship at the Stevens Institute of Technology; National Institute on Aging (NIA) [1R21AG047433-01]; EMBL Interdisciplinary Postdoc Programme under Marie Curie COFUND Actions; Ignition Grant Initiative from Stevens Institute of Technology; NIA [1R21AG047433-01]; EMBL; European Research Council [309271-NPCAtlas],"We are grateful to W.

An 11-residue segment, which we term NACore, appears to be responsible for amyloid formation and cytotoxicity of human alpha-synuclein. Here we describe crystals of NACore that have dimensions smaller than the wavelength of visible light and thus are invisible by optical microscopy. As the crystals are thousands of times too small for structure determination by synchrotron X-ray diffraction, we use micro-electron diffraction to determine the structure at atomic resolution. The 1.4 angstrom resolution structure demonstrates that this method can determine previously unknown protein structures and here yields, to our knowledge, the highest resolution achieved by any cryo-electron microscopy method to date. The structure exhibits protofibrils built of pairs of face-to-face b-sheets. X-ray fibre diffraction patterns show the similarity of NACore to toxic fibrils of full-length alpha-synuclein. The NACore structure, together with that of a second segment, inspires a model for most of the ordered portion of the toxic, full-length alpha-synuclein fibril, presenting opportunities for the design of inhibitors of alpha-synuclein fibrils.","[Rodriguez, Jose A.; Ivanova, Magdalena I.; Sawaya, Michael R.; Cascio, Duilio; Sangwan, Smriti; Guenther, Elizabeth L.; Johnson, Lisa M.; Zhang, Meng; Jiang, Lin; Arbing, Mark A.; Eisenberg, David S.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Dept Biol Chem, Dept Chem,Dept Biochem,UCLA DOE Inst, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Reyes, Francis E.; Shi, Dan; Nannenga, Brent L.; Hattne, Johan; Gonen, Tamir] Howard Hughes Med Inst, Ashburn, VA 20147 USA; [Whitelegge, Julian] Univ Calif Los Angeles, NPI Semel Inst, Los Angeles, CA 90024 USA; [Brewster, Aaron S.; Sauter, Nicholas K.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Phys Biosci Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Messerschmidt, Marc; Boutet, Bastien] SLAC Natl Accelerator Lab, Linac Coherent Light Source, Menlo Pk, CA 94025 USA","Eisenberg, DS (reprint author), Univ Calif Los Angeles, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Dept Biol Chem, Dept Chem,Dept Biochem,UCLA DOE Inst, Box 951570, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.",gonent@janelia.hhmi.org; david@mbi.ucla.edu,"; Messerschmidt, Marc/F-3796-2010; Sauter, Nicholas/K-3430-2012","Nannenga, Brent/0000-0001-6859-3429; Messerschmidt, Marc/0000-0002-8641-3302; ","National Institute of General Medical Sciences from the National Institutes of Health [P41 GM103403]; DOE Office of Science by Argonne National Laboratory [DE-AC02-06CH11357]; NIH [GM095887, GM102520]; Office of Science, Department of Energy (DOE) [DE-AC02-05CH11231]; US Department of Energy Office of Science, Office of Biological and Environmental Research program [DE-FC02-02ER63421]; National Science Foundation [MCB-0958111]; National Institutes of Health [1R01-AG029430]; Alzheimer's Disease Research (ADRC) at UCLA [NIH-AG016570]; HHMI; Giannini Foundation","We thank C.

Theyreside inhaloes with masses about 10(13) times that of the Sun2, have low gas fractions compared to main-sequence disks at a comparable redshift3, trace complex environments(4,5) and are not easily observable at optical wavelengths(6). Their physical origin remains unclear. Simulations have been able to form galaxies with the requisite luminosities, but have otherwise been unable to simultaneously match the stellar masses, star formation rates, gas fractions and environments(7-10). Here we report a cosmological hydrodynamic galaxy formation simulation that is able to forma submillimetre galaxy that simultaneously satisfies the broad range of observed physical constraints. We find that groups of galaxies residing in massive dark matter haloes have increasing rates of star formation that peak at collective rates of about 500-1,000 solarmasses per year at redshifts of two to three, by which time the interstellar medium is sufficiently enriched with metals that the region may be observed as a submillimetre-selected system. The intense star formation rates are fuelled in part by the infall of a reservoir gas supply enabled by stellar feedback at earlier times, not through major mergers. With a lifetime of nearly a billion years, our simulations show that the submillimetre-bright phase of high-redshift galaxies is prolonged and associated with significant mass buildup in early-Universe proto-clusters, and that many submillimetre- bright galaxies are composed of numerous unresolved components (for which there is some observational evidence(11)).","[Narayanan, Desika] Haverford Coll, Haverford, PA 19041 USA; [Turk, Matthew] Univ Illinois, Natl Ctr Supercomp Applicat, Urbana, IL 61820 USA; [Feldmann, Robert] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Astron, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Feldmann, Robert] Univ Calif Berkeley, Theoret Astrophys Ctr, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Robitaille, Thomas] Max Planck Inst Astron, D-69117 Heidelberg, Germany; [Hopkins, Philip; Hayward, Christopher] CALTECH, TAPIR, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA; [Thompson, Robert] Univ Western Cape, ZA-7535 Cape Town, South Africa; [Thompson, Robert; Ball, David] Univ Arizona, Steward Observ, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA; [Hayward, Christopher] Harvard Smithsonian Ctr Astrophys, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Ball, David] Whitman Coll, Walla Walla, WA 99362 USA; [Faucher-Giguere, Claude-Andre] Northwestern Univ, CIERA, Evanston, IL 60208 USA; [Keres, Dusan] Univ Calif San Diego, CASS, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA","Narayanan, D (reprint author), Haverford Coll, 370 West Lancaster Ave, Haverford, PA 19041 USA.",dnarayan@haverford.edu,,"Turk, Matthew/0000-0002-5294-0198; Hayward, Christopher/0000-0003-4073-3236; Hopkins, Philip/0000-0003-3729-1684","NSF [AST-1009452, AST-1442650, AST-1412836, AST-1412153]; NASA HST [AR-13906.001]; Cottrell College Science Award; Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation [GBMF4561, 776]; Alfred P.

This was clearly demonstrated on comet 9P/Tempel 1, where the dust jets (driven by volatiles) were only partially correlated with the exposed ice regions(8). The observations(6,7) of 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko have revealed that activity has a diurnal variation in intensity arising from changing insolation conditions. It was previously concluded that water vapour was generated in ice-rich subsurface layers with a transport mechanism linked to solar illumination(1-3,5), but that has not hitherto been observed. Periodic condensations of water vapour very close to, or on, the surface were suggested(3,9) to explain short-lived outbursts seen near sunrise on comet 9P/Tempel 1. Here we report observations of water ice on the surface of comet 67P/ChuryumovGerasimenko, appearing and disappearing in a cyclic pattern that follows local illumination conditions, providing a source of localized activity. This water cycle appears to be an important process in the evolution of the comet, leading to cyclical modification of the relative abundance of water ice on its surface.","[De Sanctis, M.

Photonic OAM states have therefore been exploited in various applications(2,3) ranging from studies of quantum entanglement and quantuminformation science(4-7) to imaging(8-12). TheOAM states of electron beams(13-15) have been shown to be similarly useful, for example in rotating nanoparticles and determining the chirality of crystals(16-19). However, although neutrons-as massive, penetrating and neutral particles-are important in materials characterization, quantum information and studies of the foundations of quantum mechanics, OAM control of neutrons has yet to be achieved. Here, we demonstrate OAM control of neutrons using macroscopic spiral phase plates that apply a ` twist' to an input neutron beam. The twisted neutron beams are analysed with neutron interferometry. Our techniques, applied to spatially incoherent beams, demonstrate both the addition of quantum angular momenta along the direction of propagation, effected by multiple spiral phase plates, and the conservation of topological charge with respect to uniform phase fluctuations. Neutron-based studies of quantum information science(20,21), the foundations of quantum mechanics(22,23), and scattering and imaging(24) of magnetic, superconducting and chiral materials have until now been limited to three degrees of freedom: spin, path and energy. The optimization of OAMcontrol, leading to well defined values ofOAM, would provide an additional quantized degree of freedom for such studies.","[Clark, Charles W.] NIST, Joint Quantum Inst, Gaithersburg, MD 20899 USA; [Clark, Charles W.] Univ Maryland, Gaithersburg, MD 20899 USA; [Barankov, Roman] Boston Univ, Photon Ctr, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Barankov, Roman] Boston Univ, Dept Biomed Engn, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Huber, Michael G.; Arif, Muhammad] NIST, Gaithersburg, MD 20899 USA; [Cory, David G.] Univ Waterloo, Dept Chem, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada; [Cory, David G.] Perimeter Inst Theoret Phys, Waterloo, ON N2L 2Y5, Canada; [Cory, David G.; Pushin, Dmitry A.] Univ Waterloo, Inst Quantum Comp, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada; [Cory, David G.] Canadian Inst Adv Res, Toronto, ON M5G 1Z8, Canada; [Pushin, Dmitry A.] Univ Waterloo, Dept Phys & Astron, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada","Pushin, DA (reprint author), Univ Waterloo, Inst Quantum Comp, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada.",dmitry.pushin@uwaterloo.ca,,"Pushin, Dmitry/0000-0002-4594-3403; , Michael/0000-0002-3795-8445",NSERC; CERC; NIST,"Financial support provided by the NSERC 'Create' and 'Discovery' programmes, CERC and the NIST Quantum Information Program is acknowledged.

Although efficient laboratory synthesis of alkaloids would enable the study and optimization of their biological properties(2), their preparation is often complicated by the basicity and nucleophilicity of nitrogen, its susceptibility to oxidation, and its ability to alter reaction outcomes in unexpected ways-for example, through stereochemical instability and neighbouring group participation. Efforts to address these issues have led to the invention of a large number of protecting groups that temper the reactivity of nitrogen3; however, the use of protecting groups typically introduces additional steps and obstacles into the synthetic route. Alternatively, the use of aromatic nitrogen heterocycles as synthetic precursors can attenuate the reactivity of nitrogen and streamline synthetic strategies(4). Here we use such an approach to achieve a synthesis of the complex anti-HIV alkaloid (1)-batzelladine B in nine steps (longest linear sequence) from simple pyrrole-based starting materials. The route uses several key transformations that would be challenging or impossible to implement using saturated nitrogen heterocycles and highlights some of the advantages of beginning with aromatic reagents.","[Parr, Brendan T.; Economou, Christos; Herzon, Seth B.] Yale Univ, Dept Chem, New Haven, CT 06520 USA","Herzon, SB (reprint author), Yale Univ, Dept Chem, 225 Prospect St, New Haven, CT 06520 USA.",seth.herzon@yale.edu,,,National Institutes of Health (NRSA fellowship) [GM110898-01A1]; National Institutes of Health (Chemistry Biology Interface Training Program) [T32GM067543]; Yale University,"Financial support from the National Institutes of Health (NRSA fellowship GM110898-01A1 to B.T.P, Chemistry Biology Interface Training Program T32GM067543 to C.E.) and Yale University is acknowledged.

Classic examples include the Hawaiian-Emperor chain and the Yellowstone-Snake River Plain province. The majority are believed to form as Earth's tectonic plates move over long-lived mantle plumes: buoyant upwellings that bring hot material from Earth's deep mantle to its surface(1). It has long been recognized that lithospheric thickness limits the rise height of plumes(2-4) and, thereby, their minimum melting pressure. It should, therefore, have a controlling influence on the geochemistry of plume-related magmas, although unambiguous evidence of this has, so far, been lacking. Here we integrate observational constraints from surface geology, geochronology, plate-motion reconstructions, geochemistry and seismology to ascertain plume melting depths beneath Earth's longest continental hotspot track, a 2,000-kilometre-long track in eastern Australia that displays a record of volcanic activity between 33 and 9 million years ago(5,6), which we call the Cosgrove track. Our analyses highlight a strong correlation between lithospheric thickness and magma composition along this track, with: (1) standard basaltic compositions in regions where lithospheric thickness is less than 110 kilometres; (2) volcanic gaps in regions where lithospheric thickness exceeds 150 kilometres; and (3) lowvolume, leucitite-bearing volcanism in regions of intermediate lithospheric thickness. Trace-element concentrations from samples along this track support the notion that these compositional variations result from different degrees of partial melting, which is controlled by the thickness of overlying lithosphere. Our results place the first observational constraints on the sub-continental melting depth of mantle plumes and provide direct evidence that lithospheric thickness has a dominant influence on the volume and chemical composition of plume-derived magmas.","[Davies, D.

Although ecologists have long acknowledged species' direct physiological and demographic responses to climate, more recent work suggests that these direct responses can be overwhelmed by indirect effects mediated via other interacting community members(2-7). Theory suggests that some of the most dramatic impacts of community change will probably arise through the assembly of novel species combinations after asynchronous migrations with climate(8-10). Empirical tests of this prediction are rare, as existing work focuses on the effects of changing interactions between competitors that co-occur today(7,11-15). To explore how species' responses to climate warming depend on how their competitors migrate to track climate, we transplanted alpine plant species and intact plant communities along a climate gradient in the Swiss Alps. Here we show that when alpine plants were transplanted to warmer climates to simulate a migration failure, their performance was strongly reduced by novel competitors that could migrate upwards from lower elevation; these effects generally exceeded the impact of warming on competition with current competitors. In contrast, when we grew the focal plants under their current climate to simulate climate tracking, a shift in the competitive environment to novel high-elevation competitors had little to no effect. This asymmetry in the importance of changing competitor identity at the leading versus trailing range edges is best explained by the degree of functional similarity between current and novel competitors. We conclude that accounting for novel competitive interactions may be essential to predict species' responses to climate change accurately.","[Alexander, Jake M.; Levine, Jonathan M.] ETH, Inst Integrat Biol, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland; [Diez, Jeffrey M.] Univ Calif Riverside, Dept Bot & Plant Sci, Riverside, CA 92521 USA","Alexander, JM (reprint author), ETH, Inst Integrat Biol, Univ Str 16, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland.",jake.alexander@usys.ethz.ch,"Levine, Jonathan/A-7167-2014; Alexander, Jake/P-2580-2014","Alexander, Jake/0000-0003-2226-7913; Levine, Jonathan/0000-0003-2857-7904",ETH Zurich,"We thank M.-J.

Here we identify the ubiquitin ligase CUL3 in complex with its vertebrate- specific substrate adaptor KBTBD8 (CUL3(KBTBD8)) as an essential regulator of human and Xenopus tropicalis neural crest specification. CUL3(KBTBD8) monoubiquitylates NOLC1 and its paralogue TCOF1, the mutation of which underlies the neurocristopathy Treacher Collins syndrome(2,3). Ubiquitylation drives formation of aTCOF1-NOLC1 platform that connects RNA polymerase I with ribosome modification enzymes and remodels the translational program of differentiating cells in favour of neural crest specification.

Although neutrophils are generally considered to be a relatively homogeneous population, evidence for heterogeneity is emerging(3,4). Under steady-state conditions, neutrophil heterogeneity may arise from ageing and replenishment by newly released neutrophils from the bone marrow(5). Aged neutrophils upregulate CXCR4, a receptor allowing their clearance in the bone marrow(6,7), with feedback inhibition of neutrophil production via the IL-17/G-CSF axis8, and rhythmic modulation of the haematopoietic stem-cell niche(5). The aged subset also expresses low levels of L-selectin(5,9). Previous studies have suggested that in vitro-aged neutrophils exhibit impaired migration and reduced pro-inflammatory properties(6,10). Here, using in vivo ageing analyses in mice, we show that neutrophil pro-inflammatory activity correlates positively with their ageing whilst in circulation. Aged neutrophils represent an overly active subset exhibiting enhanced alpha(M)beta(2) integrin activation and neutrophil extracellular trap formation under inflammatory conditions. Neutrophil ageing is driven by the microbiota via Toll-like receptor and myeloid differentiation factor 88-mediated signalling pathways. Depletion of the microbiota significantly reduces the number of circulating aged neutrophils and dramatically improves the pathogenesis and inflammation-related organ damage inmodels of sickle-cell disease or endotoxin-induced septic shock. These results identify a role for the microbiota in regulating a disease-promoting neutrophil subset.","[Zhang, Dachuan; Chen, Grace; Xu, Chunliang; Kunisaki, Yuya; Jang, Jung-Eun; Scheiermann, Christoph; Frenette, Paul S.] Albert Einstein Coll Med, Ruth L & David S Gottesman Inst Stem Cell & Regen, Bronx, NY 10461 USA; [Zhang, Dachuan; Chen, Grace; Xu, Chunliang; Kunisaki, Yuya; Jang, Jung-Eun; Scheiermann, Christoph; Frenette, Paul S.] Albert Einstein Coll Med, Dept Cell Biol, Bronx, NY 10461 USA; [Manwani, Deepa; Burk, Robert D.] Albert Einstein Coll Med, Dept Pediat, Bronx, NY USA; [Mortha, Arthur; Merad, Miriam] Mt Sinai Sch Med, Dept Oncol Sci, New York, NY 10029 USA; [Mortha, Arthur; Faith, Jeremiah J.; Merad, Miriam] Mt Sinai Sch Med, Inst Immunol, New York, NY 10029 USA; [Faith, Jeremiah J.] Mt Sinai Sch Med, Inst Genom & Multiscale Biol, New York, NY 10029 USA; [Frenette, Paul S.] Albert Einstein Coll Med, Dept Med, Bronx, NY 10461 USA","Frenette, PS (reprint author), Albert Einstein Coll Med, Ruth L & David S Gottesman Inst Stem Cell & Regen, Bronx, NY 10461 USA.",paul.frenette@einstein.yu.edu,,,"American Heart Association [15PRE23010014]; National Institutes of Health [HL069438, DK056638, HL116340]; New York State Stem Cell Science (NYSTEM) Program","We are grateful to C.

In agriculture, somaclonal variation has hindered the micropropagation of elite hybrids and genetically modified crops, but the mechanism responsible remains unknown(1). The oil palm fruit 'mantled' abnormality is a somaclonal variant arising from tissue culture that drastically reduces yield, and has largely halted efforts to clone elite hybrids for oil production(2-4). Widely regarded as an epigenetic phenomenon(5), 'mantling' has defied explanation, but here we identify the MANTLED locus using epigenome-wide association studies of the African oil palm Elaeis guineensis. DNA hypomethylation of a LINE retrotransposon related to rice Karma, in the intron of the homeotic gene DEFICIENS, is common to all mantled clones and is associated with alternative splicing and premature termination. Dense methylation near the Karma splice site (termed the Good Karma epiallele) predicts normal fruit set, whereas hypomethylation (the Bad Karma epiallele) predicts homeotic transformation, parthenocarpy and marked loss of yield. Loss of Karma methylation and of small RNA in tissue culture contributes to the origin of mantled, while restoration in spontaneous revertants accounts for non-Mendelian inheritance. The ability to predict and cull mantling at the plantlet stage will facilitate the introduction of higher performing clones and optimize environmentally sensitive land resources.","[Ong-Abdullah, Meilina; Ooi, Siew-Eng; Kok, Sau-Yee; Sarpan, Norashikin; Azimi, Nuraziyan; Hashim, Ahmad Tarmizi; Ishak, Zamzuri; Rosli, Samsul Kamal; Malike, Fadila Ahmad; Abu Bakar, Nor Azwani; Marjuni, Marhalil; Abdullah, Norziha; Yaakub, Zulkifli; Amiruddin, Mohd Din; Nookiah, Rajanaidu; Singh, Rajinder; Low, Eng-Ti Leslie; Chan, Kuang-Lim; Azizi, Norazah] Malaysian Palm Oil Board, Persiaran Inst, Kajang 43000, Selangor, Malaysia; [Ordway, Jared M.; Jiang, Nan; Smith, Steven W.; Bacher, Blaire; Budiman, Muhammad A.; Van Brunt, Andrew; Wischmeyer, Corey; Beil, Melissa; Hogan, Michael; Lakey, Nathan] Orion Genom, St Louis, MO 63108 USA; [Lim, Chin-Ching; Arulandoo, Xaviar] United Plantat Berhad, Teluk Intan 36009, Perak, Malaysia; [Wong, Choo-Kien; Choo, Chin-Nee; Wong, Wei-Chee] Appl Agr Resources Sdn Bhd, Petaling Jaya 47810, Selangor, Malaysia; [Kwan, Yen-Yen; Alwee, Sharifah Shahrul Rabiah Syed] Lengkuk Teknol, FELDA Global Ventures R&D Sdn Bhd, FELDA Biotechnol Ctr, Bandar Enstek 71760, Negeri Sembilan, Malaysia; [Martienssen, Robert A.] Cold Spring Harbor Lab, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Gordon & Betty Moore Fdn, Cold Spring Harbor, NY 11724 USA","Martienssen, RA (reprint author), Cold Spring Harbor Lab, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Gordon & Betty Moore Fdn, Cold Spring Harbor, NY 11724 USA.",raviga@mpob.gov.my; martiens@cshl.edu,"Singh, Rajinder/P-9179-2015","Singh, Rajinder/0000-0001-9933-4884; R., Samsul Kamal/0000-0003-0497-3005; Chan, Kuang-Lim/0000-0002-8419-0432",NIGMS NIH HHS [R01 GM067014],,,40,55,57,7,93,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,24-Sep,2015,525,7570,,,,,533,+,,10.1038/nature15365,,18,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,CR8KI,WOS:000361599900053,26352475,No,,,11/19/17

Early clinical trials have shown promise, especially in acute myeloid leukaemia(3), and therefore the evaluation of resistance mechanismsis crucial to optimize the clinical efficacy of these drugs. Here we use primary mouse haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells immortalized with the fusion protein MLL-AF9 to generate several single-cell clones that demonstrate resistance, in vitro and in vivo, to the prototypical BET inhibitor, I-BET. Resistance to I-BET confers cross-resistance to chemically distinct BET inhibitors such as JQ1, as well as resistance to genetic knockdown of BET proteins. Resistance is notmediated through increased drug efflux or metabolism, but is shown to emerge from leukaemia stem cells both ex vivo and in vivo. Chromatin-bound BRD4 is globally reduced in resistant cells, whereas the expression of key target genes such as Myc remains unaltered, highlighting the existence of alternative mechanisms to regulate transcription. We demonstrate that resistance to BET inhibitors, in human and mouse leukaemia cells, is in part a consequence of increasedWnt/beta-catenin signalling, and negative regulation of this pathway results in restoration of sensitivity to I-BET in vitro and in vivo. Together, these findings provide new insights into the biology of acute myeloid leukaemia, highlight potential therapeutic limitations of BET inhibitors, and identify strategies that may enhance the clinical utility of these unique targeted therapies.","[Fong, Chun Yew; Gilan, Omer; Lam, Enid Y.

While clinical trials have reported single-agent activity in advanced haematological malignancies(6), mechanisms determining the response to BET inhibition remain poorly understood. To identify factors involved in primary and acquired BET resistance in leukaemia, here we perform a chromatin-focused RNAi screen in a sensitive MLL-AF9; Nras(G12D)-driven AML mouse model, and investigate dynamic transcriptional profiles in sensitive and resistantmouse and human leukaemias. Our screen shows that suppression of the PRC2 complex, contrary to effects in other contexts, promotes BET inhibitor resistance in AML. PRC2 suppression does not directly affect the regulation of Brd4-dependent transcripts, but facilitates the remodelling of regulatory pathways that restore the transcription of key targets such as Myc. Similarly, while BET inhibition triggers acute MYC repression in human leukaemias regardless of their sensitivity, resistant leukaemias are uniformly characterized by their ability to rapidly restore MYC transcription. This process involves the activation and recruitment of WNT signalling components, which compensate for the loss of BRD4 and drive resistance in various cancer models. Dynamic chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing and self-transcribing active regulatory region sequencing of enhancer profiles reveal that BET-resistant states are characterized by remodelled regulatory landscapes, involving the activation of a focal MYC enhancer that recruits WNT machinery in response to BET inhibition. Together, our results identify and validate WNT signalling as a driver and candidate biomarker of primary and acquired BET resistance in leukaemia, and implicate the rewiring of transcriptional programs as an important mechanism promoting resistance to BET inhibitors and, potentially, other chromatin-targeted therapies.","[Rathert, Philipp; Roth, Mareike; Neumann, Tobias; Muerdter, Felix; Muhar, Matthias; Deswal, Sumit; Jude, Julian; Hoffmann, Thomas; Boryn, Lukasz M.; Axelsson, Elin; Stark, Alexander; Zuber, Johannes] Vienna Bioctr VBC, Res Inst Mol Pathol IMP, A-1030 Vienna, Austria; [Roe, Jae-Seok; Vakoc, Christopher R.] Cold Spring Harbor Lab, Cold Spring Harbor, NY 11724 USA; [Cerny-Reiterer, Sabine; Peter, Barbara; Valent, Peter] Med Univ Vienna, Div Hematol & Hemostaseol, Dept Internal Med 1, A-1090 Vienna, Austria; [Cerny-Reiterer, Sabine; Peter, Barbara; Valent, Peter] Med Univ Vienna, Ludwig Boltzmann Cluster Oncol, A-1090 Vienna, Austria; [Schweifer, Norbert; Tontsch-Grunt, Ulrike; Gianni, Davide; Pearson, Mark; Kraut, Norbert] Boehringer Ingelheim Reg Ctr Vienna GmbH, A-1121 Vienna, Austria; [Dow, Lukas E.] Weill Cornell Med Coll, Dept Med Hematol & Med Oncol, New York, NY 10065 USA","Zuber, J (reprint author), Vienna Bioctr VBC, Res Inst Mol Pathol IMP, A-1030 Vienna, Austria.",zuber@imp.ac.at,"Stark, Alexander/D-1473-2012","Stark, Alexander/0000-0003-2611-0841; Muerdter, Felix/0000-0002-0840-2544","European Research Council (ERC) [336860]; SFB of the Austrian Science Fund (FWF) [F4704, F4710]; European Union; ERC [242922]; Boehringer Ingelheim","We thank M.

We developed a novel synaptic optoprobe, AS-PaRac1 (activated synapse targeting photoactivatable Rac1), that can label recently potentiated spines specifically, and induce the selective shrinkage of AS-PaRac1-containing spines. In vivo imaging of AS-PaRac1 revealed that a motor learning task induced substantial synaptic remodelling in a small subset of neurons. The acquired motor learning was disrupted by the optical shrinkage of the potentiated spines, whereas it was not affected by the identical manipulation of spines evoked by a distinct motor task in the same cortical region.

Using an integrative approach, we generated a draft conservation map consisting of more than one million putative high-confidence co-complex interactions for species with fully sequenced genomes that encompasses functional modules present broadly across all extant animals. Clustering reveals a spectrum of conservation, ranging from ancient eukaryotic assemblies that have probably served cellular housekeeping roles for at least one billion years, ancestral complexes that have accrued contemporary components, and rarer metazoan innovations linked to multicellularity. We validated these projections by independent co-fractionation experiments in evolutionarily distant species, affinity purification and functional analyses. The comprehensiveness, centrality and modularity of these reconstructed interactomes reflect their fundamental mechanistic importance and adaptive value to animal cell systems.","[Wan, Cuihong; Phanse, Sadhna; Kagan, Olga; Kwan, Julian; Ni, Zuyao; Stoilova, Snejana; Havugimana, Pierre C.; Guo, Xinghua; Greenblatt, Jack; Emili, Andrew] Univ Toronto, Donnelly Ctr Cellular & Biomol Res, Toronto, ON M5S 3E1, Canada; [Wan, Cuihong; Borgeson, Blake; Tu, Fan; Drew, Kevin; Papoulas, Ophelia; Boutz, Daniel R.; Wallingford, John B.; Marcotte, Edward M.] Univ Texas Austin, Inst Cellular & Mol Biol, Ctr Syst & Synthet Biol, Austin, TX 78712 USA; [Clark, Greg; Bezginov, Alexandr; Tillier, Elisabeth R.] Dept Med Biophys, Toronto, ON M5G 1L7, Canada; [Xiong, Xuejian; Kwan, Julian; Chessman, Kyle; Cromar, Graham; Greenblatt, Jack; Derry, W.

Termination involves local completion of DNA synthesis, decatenation of daughter molecules and replisome disassembly. Termination has been difficult to study because termination events are generally asynchronous and sequence nonspecific. To overcome these challenges, we paused converging replisomes with a site-specific barrier in Xenopus egg extracts. Upon removal of the barrier, forks underwent synchronous and site-specific termination, allowing mechanistic dissection of this process. We show that DNA synthesis does not slow detectably as forks approach each other, and that leading strands pass each other unhindered before undergoing ligation to downstream lagging strands. Dissociation of the replicative CMG helicase (comprising CDC45, MCM2-7 and GINS) occurs only after the final ligation step, and is not required for completion of DNA synthesis, strongly suggesting that converging CMGs pass one another and dissociate from double-stranded DNA. This termination mechanism allows rapid completion of DNA synthesis while avoiding premature replisome disassembly.","[Dewar, James M.; Budzowska, Magda; Walter, Johannes C.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Biol Chem & Mol Pharmacol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Walter, Johannes C.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Biol Chem & Mol Pharmacol, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Boston, MA 02115 USA","Walter, JC (reprint author), Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Biol Chem & Mol Pharmacol, Boston, MA 02115 USA.",johannes_walter@hms.harvard.edu,,,"NIH [GM62267, GM80676]",We thank C.

Although they cannot be imaged, periodicities in the light curves of quasars have been interpreted as evidence for binaries(3-5), most recently in PG 1302-102, which has a short rest-frame optical period of four years (ref. 6). If the orbital period of the black-hole binary matches this value, then for the range of estimated black-hole masses, the components would be separated by 0.007-0.017 parsecs, implying relativistic orbital speeds. There has been much debate over whether black-hole orbits could be smaller than one parsec (ref. 7). Here we report that the amplitude and the sinusoid-like shape of the variability of the light curve of PG 1302-102 can be fitted by relativistic Doppler boosting of emission from a compact, steadily accreting, unequal-mass binary. We predict that brightness variations in the ultraviolet light curve track those in the optical, but with a two to three times larger amplitude. This prediction is relatively insensitive to the details of the emission process, and is consistent with archival ultraviolet data. Follow-up ultraviolet and optical observations in the next few years can further test this prediction and confirm the existence of a binary black hole in the relativistic regime.","[D'Orazio, Daniel J.; Haiman, Zoltan; Schiminovich, David] Columbia Univ, Dept Astron, New York, NY 10027 USA","Haiman, Z (reprint author), Columbia Univ, Dept Astron, 550 West 120th St, New York, NY 10027 USA.",zoltan@astro.columbia.edu,,"D'Orazio, Daniel/0000-0002-1271-6247",National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship [DGE1144155]; NASA [NNX11AE05G],"The authors thank M.

Deformation of the Dirac cone often reveals intriguing properties; an example is the quantum Hall effect, where a constant magnetic field breaks the Dirac cone into isolated Landau levels. A seemingly unrelated phenomenon is the exceptional point(6,7), also known as the parity-time symmetry breaking point(8-11), where two resonances coincide in both their positions and widths. Exceptional points lead to counter-intuitive phenomena such as loss-induced transparency(12), unidirectional transmission or reflection(11,13,14), and lasers with reversed pump dependence(15) or single-mode operation(16,17). Dirac cones and exceptional points are connected: it was theoretically suggested that certain non-Hermitian perturbations can deform a Dirac cone and spawn a ring of exceptional points(18-20). Here we experimentally demonstrate such an 'exceptional ring' in a photonic crystal slab. Angle-resolved reflection measurements of the photonic crystal slab reveal that the peaks of reflectivity follow the conical band structure of a Dirac cone resulting from accidental degeneracy, whereas the complex eigenvalues of the system are deformed into a two-dimensional flat band enclosed by an exceptional ring. This deformation arises from the dissimilar radiation rates of dipole and quadrupole resonances, which play a role analogous to the loss and gain in parity-time symmetric systems. Our results indicate that the radiation existing in any open system can fundamentally alter its physical properties in ways previously expected only in the presence of material loss and gain.","[Zhen, Bo; Hsu, Chia Wei; Igarashi, Yuichi; Lu, Ling; Kaminer, Ido; Pick, Adi; Joannopoulos, John D.; Soljacic, Marin] MIT, Elect Res Lab, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Hsu, Chia Wei] Yale Univ, Dept Appl Phys, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Igarashi, Yuichi] NEC Corp Ltd, Smart Energy Res Labs, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058501, Japan; [Pick, Adi] Harvard Univ, Dept Phys, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Chua, Song-Liang] DSO Natl Labs, Singapore 118230, Singapore","Zhen, B (reprint author), MIT, Elect Res Lab, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",bozhen@mit.edu; chiawei.hsu@yale.edu,"Lu, Ling/E-1324-2017; Hsu, Chia Wei (Wade)/G-5486-2011","Hsu, Chia Wei (Wade)/0000-0002-9609-7155","Army Research Office through Institute for Soldier Nanotechnologies [W911NF-07-D0004, W911NF-13-D-0001]; S3TEC, an Energy Frontier Research Center - US Department of Energy [DE-SC0001299]; Materials Research Science and Engineering Center of the National Science Foundation [DMR-1419807]; Marie Curie grant [328853-MC-BSiCS]","We thank T.

This complex, multiscale phase separation(18-21) invites the development of theories of high-temperature superconductivity that include complexity(22-25). The nature of the spatial interplay between charge and dopant order that provides a basis for nanoscale phase separation remains a key open question, because experiments have yet to probe the unknown spatial distribution at both the nanoscale and mesoscale (between atomic and macroscopic scale). Here we report micro X-ray diffraction imaging of the spatial distribution of both short-range charge-density-wave 'puddles' (domains with only a few wavelengths) and quenched disorder in HgBa2CuO4+y, the single-layer cuprate with the highest T-c, 95 kelvin (refs 26-28). We found that the charge-density-wave puddles, like the steam bubbles in boiling water, have a fat-tailed size distribution that is typical of self-organization near a critical point(19). However, the quenched disorder, which arises from oxygen interstitials, has a distribution that is contrary to the usually assumed random, uncorrelated distribution(12,13). The interstitial-oxygen-rich domains are spatially anticorrelated with the charge-density-wave domains, because higher doping does not favour the stripy charge-density-wave puddles, leading to a complex emergent geometry of the spatial landscape for superconductivity.","[Campi, G.; Bianconi, A.] CNR, Inst Crystallog, I-00015 Monterotondo Roma, Italy; [Campi, G.; Bianconi, A.; Poccia, N.; Innocenti, D.; Ricci, A.] RICMASS, Superstripes, Rome Int Ctr Mat Sci, I-00185 Rome, Italy; [Poccia, N.] Univ Twente, MESA Inst Nanotechnol, NL-7500 AE Enschede, Netherlands; [Bianconi, G.] Queen Mary Univ London, Sch Math, London E1 4SN, England; [Barba, L.; Arrighetti, G.] Sincrotrone Elettra UOS Trieste, Inst Crystallog, I-34149 Trieste, Italy; [Innocenti, D.; Karpinski, J.] Ecole Polytech Fed Lausanne, Inst Condensed Matter Phys, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland; [Karpinski, J.; Zhigadlo, N.

Both switching phenomena form the basis of non-volatile random access memory(1), but in the ferroelectric case, this involves destructive electrical reading and in the magnetic case, a high writing energy is required(2). In principle, low-power and high-density information storage that combines fast electrical writing and magnetic reading can be realized with magnetoelectric multiferroic materials(3). These materials not only simultaneously display ferroelectricity and ferromagnetism, but also enable magnetic moments to be induced by an external electric field, or electric polarization by a magnetic field(4,5). However, synthesizing bulk materials with both long-range orders at room temperature in a single crystalline structure is challenging because conventional ferroelectricity requires closed-shell d(0) or s(2) cations, whereas ferromagnetic order requires open-shell d(n) configurations with unpaired electrons(6). These opposing requirements pose considerable difficulties for atomic-scale design strategies such as magnetic ion substitution into ferroelectrics(7,8). One material that exhibits both ferroelectric and magnetic order is BiFeO3, but its cycloidal magnetic structure(9) precludes bulk magnetization and linear magnetoelectric coupling(10). A solid solution of a ferroelectric and a spin-glass perovskite combines switchable polarization(11) with glassy magnetization, although it lacks long-range magnetic order(12). Crystal engineering of a layered perovskite has recently resulted in room-temperature polar ferromagnets(13), but the electrical polarization has not been switchable. Here we combine ferroelectricity and ferromagnetism at room temperature in a bulk perovskite oxide, by constructing a percolating network of magnetic ions with strong superexchange interactions within a structural scaffold exhibiting polar lattice symmetries at a morphotropic phase boundary(14) (the compositional boundary between two polar phases with different polarization directions, exemplified by the PbZrO3-PbTiO3 system) that both enhances polarization switching and permits canting of the ordered magnetic moments. We expect this strategy to allow the generation of a range of tunable multiferroic materials.","[Mandal, P.; Pitcher, M. J.; Niu, H.; Borisov, P.; Claridge, J. B.; Rosseinsky, M.

It has proved difficult to quantify premature mortality related to air pollution, notably in regions where air quality is not monitored, and also because the toxicity of particles from various sources may vary(10). Here we use a global atmospheric chemistry model to investigate the link between prematuremortality and seven emission source categories in urban and rural environments. In accord with the global burden of disease for 2010 (ref. 5), we calculate that outdoor air pollution, mostly by PM2.5, leads to 3.3 (95 per cent confidence interval 1.61-4.81) million premature deaths per year worldwide, predominantly in Asia. We primarily assume that all particles are equally toxic(5), but also include a sensitivity study that accounts for differential toxicity. We find that emissions from residential energy use such as heating and cooking, prevalent in India and China, have the largest impact on premature mortality globally, being even more dominant if carbonaceous particles are assumed to be most toxic. Whereas in much of the USA and in a few other countries emissions from traffic and power generation are important, in eastern USA, Europe, Russia and East Asia agricultural emissions make the largest relative contribution to PM2.5, with the estimate of overall health impact depending on assumptions regarding particle toxicity. Model projections based on a business-as-usual emission scenario indicate that the contribution of outdoor air pollution to premature mortality could double by 2050.","[Lelieveld, J.; Pozzer, A.] Max Planck Inst Chem, Atmospher Chem Dept, D-55128 Mainz, Germany; [Lelieveld, J.; Giannadaki, D.] Cyprus Inst, Energy Environm & Water Res Ctr, CY-1645 Nicosia, Cyprus; [Evans, J.

Most traits are plastic, but the degree to which plasticity is adaptive or non-adaptive depends on whether environmentally induced phenotypes are closer or further away from the local optimum(2-4). Existing theories make conflicting predictions about whether plasticity constrains or facilitates adaptive evolution(4-12). Debate persists because few empirical studies have tested the relationship between initial plasticity and subsequent adaptive evolution in natural populations. Here we show that the direction of plasticity in gene expression is generally opposite to the direction of adaptive evolution. We experimentally transplanted Trinidadian guppies (Poecilia reticulata) adapted to living with cichlid predators to cichlid-free streams, and tested for evolutionary divergence in brain gene expression patterns after three to four generations. We find 135 transcripts that evolved parallel changes in expression within the replicated introduction populations. These changes are in the same direction exhibited in a native cichlid-free population, suggesting rapid adaptive evolution. We find 89% of these transcripts exhibited non-adaptive plastic changes in expression when the source population was reared in the absence of predators, as they are in the opposite direction to the evolved changes. By contrast, the remaining transcripts exhibiting adaptive plasticity show reduced population divergence. Furthermore, the most plastic transcripts in the source population evolved reduced plasticity in the introduction populations, suggesting strong selection against non-adaptive plasticity. These results support models predicting that adaptive plasticity constrains evolution(6-8), whereas non-adaptive plasticity potentiates evolution by increasing the strength of directional selection(11,12). The role of non-adaptive plasticity in evolution has received relatively little attention; however, our results suggest that it may be an important mechanism that predicts evolutionary responses to new environments.","[Ghalambor, Cameron K.; Hoke, Kim L.; Ruell, Emily W.; Fischer, Eva K.] Colorado State Univ, Dept Biol, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA; [Ghalambor, Cameron K.; Hoke, Kim L.] Colorado State Univ, Grad Degree Program Ecol, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA; [Reznick, David N.] Univ Calif Riverside, Dept Biol, Riverside, CA 92521 USA; [Hughes, Kimberly A.] Florida State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA","Ghalambor, CK (reprint author), Colorado State Univ, Dept Biol, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA.",cameron1@colostate.edu; kahughes@bio.fsu.edu,,,"National Science Foundation [DEB-0846175, EF-0623632, IOS-0934451, IOS-1354775]","This work was supported by grants from the National Science Foundation (DEB-0846175 to C.K.G., EF-0623632 to D.N.R., and IOS-0934451 and IOS-1354775 to K.A.H.).

Prime among these uncharacterized genes are cytochromes P450 upregulated in response to pathogens(3,4). Here we start with a single pathogen-induced P450 (ref. 5), CYP82C2, and use a combination of untargeted metabolomics and coexpression analysis to uncover the complete biosynthetic pathway to 4-hydroxyindole-3-carbonyl nitrile (4-OH-ICN), a previously unknown Arabidopsis metabolite. This metabolite harbours cyanogenic functionality that is unprecedented in plants and exceedingly rare in nature(6,7); furthermore, the aryl cyanohydrin intermediate in the 4-OH-ICN pathway reveals a latent capacity for cyanogenic glucoside biosynthesis(8,9) in Arabidopsis. By expressing 4-OH-ICN biosynthetic enzymes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Nicotiana benthamiana, we reconstitute the complete pathway in vitro and in vivo and validate the functions of its enzymes. Arabidopsis 4-OH-ICN pathway mutants show increased susceptibility to the bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas syringae, consistent with a role in inducible pathogen defence. Arabidopsis has been the pre-eminent model system(10,11) for studying the role of small molecules in plant innate immunity(12); our results uncover a new branch of indole metabolism distinct from the canonical camalexin pathway, and support a role for this pathway in the Arabidopsis defence response(13). These results establish a more complete framework for understanding how the model plant Arabidopsis uses small molecules in pathogen defence.","[Rajniak, Jakub; Sattely, Elizabeth S.] Stanford Univ, Dept Chem Engn, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Barco, Brenden; Clay, Nicole K.] Yale Univ, Dept Mol Cellular & Dev Biol, New Haven, CT 06511 USA","Sattely, ES (reprint author), Stanford Univ, Dept Chem Engn, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",nicole.clay@yale.edu; sattely@stanford.edu,,"Rajniak, Jakub/0000-0003-2124-0647",National Science Foundation [MCB-0519898]; National Institutes of Health [R37 GM 48707];  [R00 GM089985];  [DP2 AT008321];  [T32 GM008412-20];  [T32 GM007499-38],"We thank F.

In the stem cell hypothesis, relapse after treatment may occur by failure to eradicate cancer stem cells. Chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) is quintessential to this hypothesis. CML is a myeloproliferative disorder that results from dysregulated tyrosine kinase activity of the fusion oncoprotein BCR-ABL(2). During the chronic phase, this sole genetic abnormality (chromosomal translocation Ph+: t(9;22)(q34;q11)) at the stem cell level causes increased proliferation of myeloid cells without loss of their capacity to differentiate. Without treatment, most patients progress to the blast phase when additional oncogenic mutations result in a fatal acute leukaemia made of proliferating immature cells. Imatinib mesylate and other tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) that target the kinase activity of BCR-ABL have improved patient survival markedly. However, fewer than 10% of patients reach the stage of complete molecular response (CMR), defined as the point when BCR-ABL transcripts become undetectable in blood cells(3). Failure to reach CMR results from the inability of TKIs to eradicate quiescent CML leukaemia stem cells (LSCs)(2-4). Here we show that the residual CML LSC pool can be gradually purged by the glitazones, antidiabetic drugs that are agonists of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPAR gamma). We found that activation of PPAR gamma by the glitazones decreases expression of STAT5 and its downstreamtargets HIF2 alpha(5) and CITED2(6), which are key guardians of the quiescence and stemness of CML LSCs. When pioglitazone was given temporarily to three CML patients in chronic residual disease in spite of continuous treatment with imatinib, all of them achieved sustained CMR, up to 4.7 years after withdrawal of pioglitazone. This suggests that clinically relevant cancer eradication may become a generally attainable goal by combination therapy that erodes the cancer stem cell pool.","[Prost, Stephane; Relouzat, Francis; Ouzegdouh, Yasmine; Saliba, Joseph; Chretien, Stany; Leboulch, Philippe] Inst Emerging Dis & Innovat Therapies iMETI, CEA, F-92265 Fontenay Aux Roses, France; [Spentchian, Marc] Hop Mignot, Dept Biol Med, F-78150 Le Chesnay, France; [Massonnet, Gerald; Chomienne, Christine; Rousselot, Philippe] Hop St Louis, Inst Univ Hematol, UMR S 940, Unite Biol Cellulaire, F-75010 Paris, France; [Beressi, Jean-Paul] Hop Mignot, Serv Endocrinol & Diabetol, F-78150 Le Chesnay, France; [Verhoeyen, Els] Univ Lyon 1, CNRS, Int Ctr Infectiol Res,ENS Lyon, CIRI,EVIR Team,Inserm,U1111,UMR5308, F-69007 Lyon, France; [Verhoeyen, Els] INSERM, U895, Ctr Med Mol C3M, Equipe 3, F-06204 Nice, France; [Raggueneau, Victoria] Ctr Hosp Versailles, Lab Hematol, F-78150 Le Chesnay, France; [Maneglier, Benjamin] Ctr Hosp Versailles, Serv Biol Med, Unite Pharmacol, F-78150 Le Chesnay, France; [Castaigne, Sylvie; Chomienne, Christine; Rousselot, Philippe] Univ Versailles St Quentin En Yvelines, Serv Hematol & Oncol, Hop Mignot, F-78150 Le Chesnay, France; [Chretien, Stany] Inst Emerging Dis & Innovat Therapies iMETI, INSERM, F-92265 Fontenay Aux Roses, France; [Leboulch, Philippe] Brigham & Womens Hosp, Genet Div, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Leboulch, Philippe] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Leboulch, Philippe] Ramathibodi Hosp, Hematol Div, Bangkok 10400, Thailand; [Leboulch, Philippe] Mahidol Univ, Bangkok 10400, Thailand","Prost, S (reprint author), Inst Emerging Dis & Innovat Therapies iMETI, CEA, F-92265 Fontenay Aux Roses, France.",stephane.prost@cea.fr; pleboulch@rics.bwh.harvard.edu,"PROST, Stephane/I-8362-2015; Verhoeyen, Els/H-6360-2016","PROST, Stephane/0000-0002-8567-8253; ","Association Laurette Fugain, Paris, France; Association pour la Recherche sur le Cancer, Villejuif, France; Chaire industrielle de l'Agence Nationale pour la Recherche (ANR)","We thank C.

Despite intensive study, the MYC oncogene remains recalcitrant to therapeutic inhibition. MYC is a transcription factor, and many of its protumorigenic functions have been attributed to its ability to regulate gene expression programs(1-3). Notably, oncogenic MYC activation has also been shown to increase total RNA and protein production in many tissue and disease contexts(4-7). While such increases in RNA and protein production may endow cancer cells with pro-tumour hallmarks, this increase in synthesis may also generate new or heightened burden on MYC-driven cancer cells to process these macromolecules properly(8). Here we discover that the spliceosome is a new target of oncogenic stress in MYC-driven cancers. We identify BUD31 as a MYC-synthetic lethal gene in human mammary epithelial cells, and demonstrate that BUD31 is a component of the core spliceosome required for its assembly and catalytic activity. Core spliceosomal factors (such as SF3B1 and U2AF1) associated with BUD31 are also required to tolerate oncogenic MYC. Notably, MYC hyperactivation induces an increase in total precursor messenger RNA synthesis, suggesting an increased burden on the core spliceosome to process pre-mRNA. In contrast to normal cells, partial inhibition of the spliceosome in MYC-hyperactivated cells leads to global intron retention, widespread defects in pre-mRNA maturation, and deregulation of many essential cell processes. Notably, genetic or pharmacological inhibition of the spliceosome in vivo impairs survival, tumorigenicity and metastatic proclivity of MYC-dependent breast cancers. Collectively, these data suggest that oncogenic MYC confers a collateral stress on splicing, and that components of the spliceosome may be therapeutic entry points for aggressive MYC-driven cancers.","[Hsu, Tiffany Y. -T.; Neill, Nicholas J.; Bland, Christopher S.; Sun, Tingting; Kurley, Sarah J.; Tyagi, Siddhartha; Karlin, Kristen L.; Dominguez-Vidana, Rocio; Skinner, Samuel O.; Jain, Antrix; Orellana, Mayra; Golding, Ido; Westbrook, Thomas F.] Baylor Coll Med, Verna & Marrs McLean Dept Biochem & Mol Biol, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Hsu, Tiffany Y. -T.; Dominguez-Vidana, Rocio; Neilson, Joel R.; Westbrook, Thomas F.] Baylor Coll Med, Interdept Program Mol & Biomed Sci, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Hsu, Tiffany Y. -T.] Baylor Coll Med, Med Scientist Training Program, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Hsu, Tiffany Y. -T.; Simon, Lukas M.; Neill, Nicholas J.; Bland, Christopher S.; Sun, Tingting; Kurley, Sarah J.; Tyagi, Siddhartha; Karlin, Kristen L.; Dominguez-Vidana, Rocio; Hartman, Jessica D.; Renwick, Alexander; Orellana, Mayra; Shaw, Chad A.; Westbrook, Thomas F.] Baylor Coll Med, Dept Mol & Human Genet, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Marcotte, Richard; Sayad, Azin] Univ Hlth Network, Princess Margaret Canc Ctr, Toronto, ON M5G 2C4, Canada; [Echeverria, Gloria V.; Neilson, Joel R.; Cooper, Thomas A.] Baylor Coll Med, Dept Mol Physiol & Biophys, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Echeverria, Gloria V.; Cooper, Thomas A.] Baylor Coll Med, Dept Pathol & Immunol, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Echeverria, Gloria V.; Cooper, Thomas A.] Baylor Coll Med, Dept Mol & Cellular Biol, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Scorsone, Kathleen; Bernardi, Ronald J.] Baylor Coll Med, Dept Pediat, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Skinner, Samuel O.; Golding, Ido] Univ Illinois, Dept Phys, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Lagisetti, Chandraiah] SRI Int, Ctr Chem Biol, Biosci Div, Menlo Pk, CA 94025 USA; [Zhang, Xiang H-F.] Baylor Coll Med, Lester & Sue Smith Breast Ctr, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Neel, Benjamin G.] Univ Toronto, Dept Med Biophys, Toronto, ON M5S 2J7, Canada","Westbrook, TF (reprint author), Baylor Coll Med, Verna & Marrs McLean Dept Biochem & Mol Biol, Houston, TX 77030 USA.",thomasw@bcm.edu,,"Simon, Lukas/0000-0001-6148-8861","NIH [NCI 1F30CA180447, 1R01CA178039-01, U54-CA149196]; CPRIT [RP101499, RP120583]; Gillson Longenbaugh Foundation; Alex's Lemonade Stand Foundation; Susan G.

Several DNA modifications such as 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) are catalysed by the ten eleven translocation (Tet) methylcytosine dioxygenase family members2, and the roles of Tet proteins in regulating chromatin architecture and gene transcription independently of DNA methylation have been gradually uncovered(3). However, the regulation of immunity and inflammation by Tet proteins independent of their role in modulating DNA methylation remains largely unknown. Here we show that Tet2 selectively mediates active repression of interleukin-6 (IL-6) transcription during inflammation resolution in innate myeloid cells, including dendritic cells and macrophages. Loss of Tet2 resulted in the upregulation of several inflammatory mediators, including IL-6, at late phase during the response to lipopolysaccharide challenge. Tet2-deficient mice were more susceptible to endotoxin shock and dextran-sulfate-sodium-induced colitis, displaying a more severe inflammatory phenotype and increased IL-6 production compared to wild-type mice. I kappa B zeta, an IL-6-specific transcription factor, mediated specific targeting of Tet2 to the Il6 promoter, further indicating opposite regulatory roles of I kappa B zeta at initial and resolution phases of inflammation. For the repression mechanism, independent of DNA methylation and hydroxymethylation, Tet2 recruited Hdac2 and repressed transcription of Il6 via histone deacetylation. We provide mechanistic evidence for the gene-specific transcription repression activity of Tet2 via histone deacetylation and for the prevention of constant transcription activation at the chromatin level for resolving inflammation.","[Zhang, Qian; Zhao, Kai; Li, Xia; Zhao, Dezhi; Wang, Chunmei; Ge, Wei; Cao, Xuetao] Chinese Acad Med Sci, Inst Basic Med Sci, Peking Union Med Coll, Natl Key Lab Med Mol Biol, Beijing 100005, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Qian; Zhao, Kai; Li, Xia; Zhao, Dezhi; Wang, Chunmei; Ge, Wei; Cao, Xuetao] Chinese Acad Med Sci, Inst Basic Med Sci, Peking Union Med Coll, Dept Immunol, Beijing 100005, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Qian; Shen, Qicong; Han, Yanmei; Gu, Yan; Liu, Yiqi; Zhang, Xiang; Su, Xiaoping; Liu, Juan; Li, Nan; Cao, Xuetao] Second Mil Med Univ, Natl Key Lab Med Immunol, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Qian; Shen, Qicong; Han, Yanmei; Gu, Yan; Liu, Yiqi; Zhang, Xiang; Su, Xiaoping; Liu, Juan; Li, Nan; Cao, Xuetao] Second Mil Med Univ, Inst Immunol, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China; [Levine, Ross L.] Mem Sloan Kettering Canc, Human Oncol & Pathogenesis Program, New York, NY 10016 USA; [Levine, Ross L.] Mem Sloan Kettering Canc, Leukemia Serv, Dept Med, New York, NY 10016 USA","Cao, XT (reprint author), Chinese Acad Med Sci, Inst Basic Med Sci, Peking Union Med Coll, Natl Key Lab Med Mol Biol, Beijing 100005, Peoples R China.",caoxt@immunol.org,"Han, Yanmei/D-8995-2016",,"National Key Basic Research Program of China [2013CB530503]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [31200654, 31390431, 81230074, 81123006]","This work was supported by the National Key Basic Research Program of China (2013CB530503) and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (31200654, 31390431, 81230074, 81123006).",,29,76,88,7,58,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,17-Sep,2015,525,7569,,,,,389,+,,10.1038/nature15252,,14,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,CR4JL,WOS:000361297900046,26287468,No,Y,N,11/19/17

Despite variable rates of replication fork progression, fork convergence often occurs at specific sites(1). Escherichia coli sets a 'replication fork trap' that allows the first arriving fork to enter but not to leave the terminus region(2-5). The trap is set by oppositely oriented Tus-bound Ter sites that block forks on approach fromonly one direction(3-7). However, the efficiency of fork blockage by Tus-Ter does not exceed 50% in vivo despite its apparent ability to almost permanently arrest replication forks in vitro(8,9). Here we use data from single-molecule DNA replication assays and structural studies to show that both polarity and fork-arrest efficiency are determined by a competition between rates of Tus displacement and rearrangement of Tus-Ter interactions that leads to blockage of slower moving replisomes by two distinct mechanisms. To our knowledge this is the first example where intrinsic differences in rates of individual replisomes have different biological outcomes.","[Elshenawy, Mohamed M.; Sobhy, Mohamed A.; Takahashi, Masateru; Hamdan, Samir M.] King Abdullah Univ Sci & Technol, Div Biol & Environm Sci Engn, Thuwal 23955, Saudi Arabia; [Jergic, Slobodan; Xu, Zhi-Qiang; Oakley, Aaron J.; Dixon, Nicholas E.] Illawarra Hlth & Med Res, Ctr Med & Mol Biosci, Wollongong, NSW 2522, Australia; [Jergic, Slobodan; Xu, Zhi-Qiang; Oakley, Aaron J.; Dixon, Nicholas E.] Univ Wollongong, Wollongong, NSW 2522, Australia","Dixon, NE (reprint author), Illawarra Hlth & Med Res, Ctr Med & Mol Biosci, Wollongong, NSW 2522, Australia.",nickd@uow.edu.au; samir.hamdan@kaust.edu.sa,"Oakley, Aaron/A-9464-2013","Oakley, Aaron/0000-0002-4764-014X; Hamdan, Samir/0000-0001-5192-1852; Elshenawy, Mohamed/0000-0002-8599-8388","King Abdullah University of Science and Technology; Faculty Initiated Collaborative Award; Australian Research Council [DP0877658, DP0984797, FT0990287]","We thank A. van Oijen for critical comments and the groups of N.

Integrator is endowed with a core catalytic RNA endonuclease activity, which is required for the 3'-end processing of non-polyadenylated, RNAPII-dependent, uridylate-rich, small nuclearRNAgenes(1). Here we examine the requirement of Integrator in the biogenesis of transcripts derived from distal regulatory elements (enhancers) involved in tissue-and temporal-specific regulation of gene expression in metazoans(2-5). Integrator is recruited to enhancers and super-enhancers in a stimulus-dependent manner. Functional depletion of Integrator subunits diminishes the signal-dependent induction of enhancer RNAs (eRNAs) and abrogates stimulus-induced enhancer-promoter chromatin looping. Global nuclear run-on and RNAPII profiling reveals a role for Integrator in 3'-end cleavage of eRNA primary transcripts leading to transcriptional termination. In the absence of Integrator, eRNAs remain bound to RNAPII and their primary transcripts accumulate. Notably, the induction of eRNAs and gene expression responsiveness requires the catalytic activity of Integrator complex. We propose a role for Integrator in biogenesis of eRNAs and enhancer function in metazoans.","[Lai, Fan; Gardini, Alessandro; Zhang, Anda; Shiekhattar, Ramin] Univ Miami, Miller Sch Med, Sylvester Comprehens Canc Ctr, Dept Human Genet, Miami, FL 33136 USA","Shiekhattar, R (reprint author), Univ Miami, Miller Sch Med, Sylvester Comprehens Canc Ctr, Dept Human Genet, Biomed Res Bldg,Room 719,1501 NW 10th Ave, Miami, FL 33136 USA.",rshiekhattar@med.miami.edu,,,"University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center; National Institute of Health [R01GM078455, R01 GM105754]","We would like to thank J.M.

Dynamin forms predominantly tetramers in the cytosol, which oligomerize at the neck of clathrin-coated vesicles to mediate constriction and subsequent scission of the membrane(1). Previous studies have described the architecture of dynamin dimers(2,3), but the molecular determinants for dynamin assembly and its regulation have remained unclear. Here we present the crystal structure of the human dynamin tetramer in the nucleotide-free state. Combining structural data with mutational studies, oligomerization measurements and Markov state models of molecular dynamics simulations, we suggest a mechanism by which oligomerization of dynamin is linked to the release of intramolecular autoinhibitory interactions. We elucidate how mutations that interfere with tetramer formation and autoinhibition can lead to the congenital muscle disorders Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathy(4) and centronuclear myopathy(5), respectively. Notably, the bent shape of the tetramer explains how dynamin assembles into a right-handed helical oligomer of defined diameter, which has direct implications for its function in membrane constriction.","[Reubold, Thomas F.; Curth, Ute; Anand, Roopsee; Manstein, Dietmar J.; Eschenburg, Susanne] Hannover Med Sch, Inst Biophys Chem, D-30625 Hannover, Germany; [Faelber, Katja; Schlegel, Jeanette; Daumke, Oliver] Max Delbruck Ctr Mol Med, Kristallog, D-13125 Berlin, Germany; [Plattner, Nuria] Free Univ Berlin, Inst Math, D-14195 Berlin, Germany; [Posor, York; Ketel, Katharina; Haucke, Volker] Leibniz Inst Mol Pharmacol, D-13125 Berlin, Germany; [Curth, Ute; Manstein, Dietmar J.] Hannover Med Sch, Forsch Einrichtung Strukt Analyse, D-30625 Hannover, Germany; [Haucke, Volker; Daumke, Oliver] Free Univ Berlin, Inst Chem & Biochem, D-14195 Berlin, Germany","Faelber, K (reprint author), Max Delbruck Ctr Mol Med, Kristallog, Robert Rossle Str 10, D-13125 Berlin, Germany.",katja.faelber@mdc-berlin.de; oliver.daumke@mdc-berlin.de; Eschenburg.Susanne@mh-hannover.de,,"Haucke, Volker/0000-0003-3119-6993","Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft [MA1081/8-2, SFB740/D7, SFB958/A04, SFB740/C8, SFB 958/A7, SFB 740/C7, SFB958/A12, ES410/2-1]; ERC consolidator grant [ERC-2013-CoG-616024]; ERC starting grant; Einstein Foundation Berlin (SOoPiC); Cluster of Excellence REBIRTH [DFG EXC 62/1]","This project was supported by grants from the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (MA1081/8-2 to D.J.M.; SFB740/D7 and SFB958/A04 to F.N.; SFB740/C8 and SFB 958/A7 to V.H.; SFB 740/C7 and SFB958/A12 to O.D.; and ES410/2-1 to S.E.), an ERC consolidator grant (ERC-2013-CoG-616024 to O.D.), an ERC starting grant (pcCell to F.N.) and a grant from the Einstein Foundation Berlin (SOoPiC to N.P.).

We provide the first spatially continuous map of forest tree density at a global scale. This map reveals that the global number of trees is approximately 3.04 trillion, an order of magnitude higher than the previous estimate. Of these trees, approximately 1.39 trillion exist in tropical and subtropical forests, with 0.74 trillion in boreal regions and 0.61 trillion in temperate regions. Biome-level trends in tree density demonstrate the importance of climate and topography in controlling local tree densities at finer scales, as well as the overwhelming effect of humans across most of the world. Based on our projected tree densities, we estimate that over 15 billion trees are cut down each year, and the global number of trees has fallen by approximately 46% since the start of human civilization.","[Crowther, T.

Prevalent p53 missense mutations abrogate its tumour suppressive function and lead to a 'gain-of-function' (GOF) that promotes cancer. Here we show that p53 GOF mutants bind to and upregulate chromatin regulatory genes, including the methyltransferases MLL1 (also known as KMT2A), MLL2 (also known as KMT2D), and acetyltransferase MOZ (also known as KAT6A or MYST3), resulting in genome-wide increases of histone methylation and acetylation. Analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas shows specific upregulation of MLL1, MLL2, and MOZ in p53 GOF patient-derived tumours, but not in wild-type p53 or p53 null tumours. Cancer cell proliferation is markedly lowered by genetic knockdown of MLL1 or by pharmacological inhibition of the MLL1 methyltransferase complex. Our study reveals a novel chromatin mechanism underlying the progression of tumours with GOF p53, and suggests new possibilities for designing combinatorial chromatin-based therapies for treating individual cancers driven by prevalent GOF p53 mutations.","[Zhu, Jiajun; Sammons, Morgan A.; Donahue, Greg; Dou, Zhixun; Berger, Shelley L.] Univ Penn, Cell & Dev Biol, Perelman Sch Med, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Zhu, Jiajun; Sammons, Morgan A.; Donahue, Greg; Dou, Zhixun; Berger, Shelley L.] Univ Penn, Epigenet Program, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Zhu, Jiajun] Univ Penn, Perelman Sch Med, Biomed Grad Studies, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Vedadi, Masoud; Barsyte-Lovejoy, Dalia; Arrowsmith, Cheryl H.] Univ Toronto, Struct Genom Consortium, Toronto, ON M5G 1L7, Canada; [Vedadi, Masoud; Al-Awar, Rima] Univ Toronto, Dept Pharmacol & Toxicol, Toronto, ON M5S 1A8, Canada; [Getlik, Matthaus; Al-Awar, Rima] Ontario Inst Canc Res, Drug Discovery Program, Toronto, ON M5G 0A3, Canada; [Katona, Bryson W.; Hua, Xianxin] Univ Penn, Perelman Sch Med, Dept Canc Biol, Abramson Family Canc Res Inst, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Shilatifard, Ali] Northwestern Univ, Dept Biochem & Mol Genet, Feinberg Sch Med, Chicago, IL 60611 USA; [Huang, Jing] NCI, Canc & Stem Cell Epigenet, Lab Canc Biol & Genet, Ctr Canc Res, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Arrowsmith, Cheryl H.] Univ Toronto, Princess Margaret Canc Ctr, Toronto, ON M5G 2C4, Canada; [Arrowsmith, Cheryl H.] Univ Toronto, Dept Med Biophys, Toronto, ON M5G 2C4, Canada","Berger, SL (reprint author), Univ Penn, Cell & Dev Biol, Perelman Sch Med, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",bergers@upenn.edu,"Huang, Jing/A-2566-2009; Zhu, Jiajun/R-6196-2016","Huang, Jing/0000-0002-7163-5156; Zhu, Jiajun/0000-0002-1760-3081","NIH [R01 CA078831, R01 GM069905]; American Cancer Society; ITMAT of the University of Pennsylvania; AbbVie; Bayer; Boehringer Ingelheim; Genome Canada through the Ontario Genomics Institute [OGI-055]; GlaxoSmithKline; Janssen; Lilly Canada; Merck; Novartis Research Foundation; Ontario Ministry of Economic Development and Innovation; Pfizer; Takeda; Wellcome Trust [092809/Z/10/Z]; Canadian Cancer Society Research Institute","We thank M.

These clouds are dense and self-gravitating, and in all existing observations they are molecular, with H-2 the dominant species and carbon monoxide (CO) the best available tracer(1,2). When the abundances of carbon and oxygen are low compared with that of hydrogen, and the opacity from dust is also low, as in primeval galaxies and local dwarf irregular galaxies(3), CO forms slowly and is easily destroyed, so it is difficult for it to accumulate inside dense clouds(4). Here we report interferometric observations of CO clouds in the local group dwarf irregular galaxy Wolf-Lundmark-Melotte (WLM)(5), which has a metallicity that is 13 per cent of the solar value(6,7) and 50 per cent lower than the previous CO detection threshold. The clouds are tiny compared to the surrounding atomic and H-2 envelopes, but they have typical densities and column densities for CO clouds in the Milky Way. The normal CO density explains why star clusters forming in dwarf irregulars have similar densities to star clusters in giant spiral galaxies. The low cloud masses suggest that these clusters will also be low mass, unless some galaxy-scale compression occurs, such as an impact from a cosmic cloud or other galaxy. If the massive metal-poor globular clusters in the halo of the Milky Way formed in dwarf galaxies, as is commonly believed, then they were probably triggered by such an impact.","[Rubio, Monica] Univ Chile, Dept Astron, Santiago 8320000, Chile; [Elmegreen, Bruce G.] IBM Corp, Div Res, TJ Watson Res Ctr, Yorktown Hts, NY 10598 USA; [Hunter, Deidre A.] Lowell Observ, Flagstaff, AZ 86001 USA; [Brinks, Elias] Univ Hertfordshire, Ctr Astrophys Res, Hatfield AL10 9AB, Herts, England; [Cortes, Juan R.] Joint ALMA Observ, Santiago 7630355, Chile; [Cortes, Juan R.] Natl Radio Astron Observ, Santiago 7630197, Chile; [Cigan, Phil] New Mexico Inst Min & Technol, Socorro, NM 87801 USA","Elmegreen, BG (reprint author), IBM Corp, Div Res, TJ Watson Res Ctr, 1101 Kitchawan Rd, Yorktown Hts, NY 10598 USA.",bge@us.ibm.com,"Rubio, Monica/J-3384-2016","Brinks, Elias/0000-0002-7758-9699","Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT) through FONDECYT [1140839]; CONICYT [BASAL PFB-06]; Lowell Observatory Research Fund; NASA (National Aeronautics and Space Administration) JPL RSA [1433776, 1456896]","We wish to thank P.

Despite its conceptual simplicity, it entails a wide range of intriguing phenomena, such as the Mollow-triplet emission spectrum(1), photon antibunching(2) and coherent photon emission(3). One fundamental aspect of resonance fluorescence-squeezing in the form of reduced quantum fluctuations in the single photon stream from an atom in free space-was predicted more than 30 years ago(4). However, the requirement to operate in the weak excitation regime, together with the combination of modest oscillator strength of atoms and low collection efficiencies, has continued to necessitate stringent experimental conditions for the observation of squeezing with atoms. Attempts to circumvent these issues had to sacrifice antibunching, owing to either stimulated forward scattering from atomic ensembles(5,6) or multi-photon transitions inside optical cavities(7,8). Here, we use an artificial atom with a large optical dipole enabling 100-fold improvement of the photon detection rate over the natural atom counterpart(9) and reach the necessary conditions for the observation of quadrature squeezing in single resonance-fluorescence photons. By implementing phase-dependent homodyne intensity-correlation detection(9-11), we demonstrate that the electric field quadrature variance of resonance fluorescence is three per cent below the fundamental limit set by vacuum fluctuations, while the photon statistics remain antibunched. The presence of squeezing and antibunching simultaneously is a fully non-classical outcome of the wave-particle duality of photons.","[Schulte, Carsten H.

It is also very incompressible(2-4), but its high-pressure behaviour is not well understood because it has been studied(2-6) so far only at pressures below 75 gigapascals. Here we report powder X-ray diffraction measurements on Os at multi-megabar pressures using both conventional and double-stage diamond anvil cells(7), with accurate pressure determination ensured by first obtaining self-consistent equations of state of gold, platinum, and tungsten in static experiments up to 500 gigapascals. These measurements allow us to show that Os retains its hexagonal close-packed structure upon compression to over 770 gigapascals. But although its molar volume monotonically decreases with pressure, the unit cell parameter ratio of Os exhibits anomalies at approximately 150 gigapascals and 440 gigapascals. Dynamical mean-field theory calculations suggest that the former anomaly is a signature of the topological change of the Fermi surface for valence electrons. However, the anomaly at 440 gigapascals might be related to an electronic transition associated with pressure-induced interactions between core electrons. The ability to affect the core electrons under static high-pressure experimental conditions, even for incompressible metals such as Os, opens up opportunities to search for new states of matter under extreme compression.","[Dubrovinsky, L.; Bykova, E.] Univ Bayreuth, Bavarian Res Inst Expt Geochem & Geophys, D-95440 Bayreuth, Germany; [Dubrovinskaia, N.; Bykova, E.; Bykov, M.] Univ Bayreuth, Crystallog Lab, D-95440 Bayreuth, Germany; [Prakapenka, V.; Prescher, C.] Univ Chicago, Ctr Adv Radiat Sources, Argonne, IL 60437 USA; [Glazyrin, K.; Liermann, H. -P.] Deutsch Elektronen Synchrotron DESY, Photon Sci, D-22603 Hamburg, Germany; [Hanfland, M.] European Synchrotron Radiat Facil, F-38043 Grenoble, France; [Ekholm, M.; Feng, Q.; Pourovskii, L.

Over the past decade, sophisticated single-component nanostructures composed exclusively of nucleic acids(2-5), peptides(6-8) and proteins(9-15) have been reported, and these nanostructures have been used in a wide range of applications, from drug delivery(16) to molecular computing(17). Despite these successes, the development of hybrid co-assemblies of nucleic acids and proteins has remained elusive. Here we use computational protein design to create a protein-DNA co-assembling nanomaterial whose assembly is driven via non-covalent interactions. To achieve this, a homodimerization interface is engineered onto the Drosophila Engrailed homeodomain (ENH), allowing the dimerized protein complex to bind to two double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) molecules. By varying the arrangement of protein-binding sites on the dsDNA, an irregular bulk nanoparticle or a nanowire with single-molecule width can be spontaneously formed by mixing the protein and dsDNA building blocks. We characterize the protein-DNA nanowire using fluorescence microscopy, atomic force microscopy and X-ray crystallography, confirming that the nanowire is formed via the proposed mechanism. This work lays the foundation for the development of new classes of protein-DNA hybrid materials. Further applications can be explored by incorporating DNA origami, DNA aptamers and/or peptide epitopes into the protein-DNA framework presented here.","[Mou, Yun; Mayo, Stephen L.] CALTECH, Div Chem & Chem Engn, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA; [Yu, Jiun-Yann; Wannier, Timothy M.; Mayo, Stephen L.] CALTECH, Div Biol & Biol Engn, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA; [Guo, Chin-Lin] CALTECH, Div Engn & Appl Sci, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA","Mou, Y (reprint author), CALTECH, Div Chem & Chem Engn, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA.",mouung@caltech.edu; steve@mayo.caltech.edu,,"Wannier, Timothy/0000-0002-4165-4751","Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Protein Design Processes Program, a National Security Science and Engineering Faculty Fellowship (NSSEFF) [N00244-09-1-0011, N00244-09-1-0082]; Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation [GBMF2809]; Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation; Department of Energy; National Institutes of Health","This study was supported by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Protein Design Processes Program, a National Security Science and Engineering Faculty Fellowship (NSSEFF N00244-09-1-0011, N00244-09-1-0082), and the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation through grant GBMF2809 to the Caltech Programmable Molecular Technology Initiative.

The formation of ice in clouds is facilitated by the presence of airborne ice-nucleating particles(1,2). Sea spray is one of the major global sources of atmospheric particles, but it is unclear to what extent these particles are capable of nucleating ice(3-11). Sea-spray aerosol contains large amounts of organic material that is ejected into the atmosphere during bubble bursting at the organically enriched sea-air interface or sea surface microlayer(12-19). Here we show that organic material in the sea surface microlayer nucleates ice under conditions relevant for mixed-phase cloud and high-altitude ice cloud formation. The ice-nucleating material is probably biogenic and less than approximately 0.2 micrometres in size. We find that exudates separated from cells of the marine diatom Thalassiosira pseudonana nucleate ice, and propose that organic material associated with phytoplankton cell exudates is a likely candidate for the observed ice-nucleating ability of the microlayer samples. Global model simulations of marine organic aerosol, in combination with our measurements, suggest that marine organic material may be an important source of ice-nucleating particles in remote marine environments such as the Southern Ocean, North Pacific Ocean and North Atlantic Ocean.","[Wilson, Theodore W.; Brooks, Ian M.; Browse, Jo; Carslaw, Kenneth S.; Judd, Christopher; Temprado, Jesus Vergara; Whale, Thomas F.; Murray, Benjamin J.] Univ Leeds, Sch Earth & Environm, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England; [Ladino, Luis A.; Wong, Jenny P.

Despite strong genomic evidence indicating that turtles evolved from within the diapsid radiation (which includes all other living reptiles(6,7)), evidence of the inferred transformation between an ancestral turtle with an open, diapsid skull to the closed, anapsid condition of modern turtles remains elusive. Here we use high-resolution computed tomography and a novel character/taxon matrix to study the skull of Eunotosaurus africanus, a 260-million-year-old fossil reptile from the Karoo Basin of South Africa, whose distinctive post-cranial skeleton shares many unique features with the shelled body plan of turtles(2-4). Scepticism regarding the status of Eunotosaurus as the earliest stem turtle arises from the possibility that these shell-related features are the products of evolutionary convergence. Our phylogenetic analyses indicate strong cranial support for Eunotosaurus as a critical transitional form in turtle evolution, thus fortifying a 40-million-year extension to the turtle stem and moving the ecological context of its origin back onto land(8,9). Furthermore, we find unexpected evidence that Eunotosaurus is a diapsid reptile in the process of becoming secondarily anapsid. This is important because categorizing the skull based on the number of openings in the complex of dermal bone covering the adductor chamber has long held sway in amniote systematics(10), and still represents a common organizational scheme for teaching the evolutionary history of the group. These discoveries allow us to articulate a detailed and testable hypothesis of fenestral closure represents a crucially important link in a chain that will eventually lead to consilience in reptile systematics, paving the way for synthetic studies of amniote evolution and development.","[Bever, G.

Despite two decades of investigation, little is known about how this comparison is made. To determine how dopamine neurons calculate prediction error, we combined optogenetic manipulations with extracellular recordings in the ventral tegmental area while mice engaged in classical conditioning. Here we demonstrate, by manipulating the temporal expectation of reward, that dopamine neurons perform subtraction, a computation that is ideal for reinforcement learning but rarely observed in the brain. Furthermore, selectively exciting and inhibiting neighbouring GABA (c-aminobutyric acid) neurons in the ventral tegmental area reveals that these neurons are a source of subtraction: they inhibit dopamine neurons when reward is expected, causally contributing to prediction-error calculations. Finally, bilaterally stimulating ventral tegmental area GABA neurons dramatically reduces anticipatory licking to conditioned odours, consistent with an important role for these neurons in reinforcement learning. Together, our results uncover the arithmetic and local circuitry underlying dopamine prediction errors.","[Eshel, Neir; Bukwich, Michael; Rao, Vinod; Hemmelder, Vivian; Tian, Ju; Uchida, Naoshige] Harvard Univ, Dept Mol & Cellular Biol, Ctr Brain Sci, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA","Uchida, N (reprint author), Harvard Univ, Dept Mol & Cellular Biol, Ctr Brain Sci, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",uchida@mcb.harvard.edu,,"Uchida, Naoshige/0000-0002-5755-9409; Eshel, Neir/0000-0002-5976-2013","Sackler Fellowship in Psychobiology; National Institutes of Health [T32GM007753, F30MH100729, R01MH095953, R01MH101207]","We thank M.

Although such treatment ceased in 1985, iatrogenic CJD (iCJD) continues to emerge because of the prolonged incubation periods seen in human prion infections. Unexpectedly, in an autopsy study of eight individuals with iCJD, aged 36-51 years, in four we found moderate to severe grey matter and vascular amyloid-beta (A beta) pathology. The A beta deposition in the grey matter was typical of that seen in Alzheimer's disease and A beta in the blood vessel walls was characteristic of cerebral amyloid angiopathy(3) and did not co-localize with prion protein deposition. None of these patients had pathogenic mutations, APOE epsilon 4 or other high-risk alleles(4) associated with early-onset Alzheimer's disease. Examination of a series of 116 patients with other prion diseases from a prospective observational cohort study(5) showed minimal or no A beta pathology in cases of similar age range, or a decade older, without APOE epsilon 4 risk alleles. We also analysed pituitary glands from individuals with A beta pathology and found marked A beta deposition in multiple cases. Experimental seeding of A beta pathology has been previously demonstrated in primates and transgenic mice by central nervous system or peripheral inoculation with Alzheimer's disease brain homogenate(6-11). The marked deposition of parenchymal and vascular A beta in these relatively young patients with iCJD, in contrast with other prion disease patients and population controls, is consistent with iatrogenic transmission of A beta pathology in addition to CJD and suggests that healthy exposed individuals may also be at risk of iatrogenic Alzheimer's disease and cerebral amyloid angiopathy. These findings should also prompt investigation of whether other known iatrogenic routes of prion transmission may also be relevant to A beta and other proteopathic seeds associated with neurodegenerative and other human diseases.","[Jaunmuktane, Zane; Brandner, Sebastian] Natl Hosp Neurol & Neurosurg, Div Neuropathol, London WC1N 3BG, England; [Mead, Simon; Wadsworth, Jonathan D.

Traditional methods for visualizing and isolating subpopulations of cells are based on messenger RNA or protein expression of only a few known marker genes. The unequivocal identification of a specific marker gene, however, poses a major challenge, particularly if this cell type is rare. Identifying rare cell types, such as stem cells, short-lived progenitors, cancer stem cells, or circulating tumour cells, is crucial to acquire a better understanding of normal or diseased tissue biology. To address this challenge we first sequenced the transcriptome of hundreds of randomly selected cells from mouse intestinal organoids(1), cultured self-organizing epithelial structures that contain all cell lineages of the mammalian intestine. Organoid buds, like intestinal crypts, harbour stem cells that continuously differentiate into a variety of cell types, occurring at widely different abundances(2). Since available computational methods can only resolve more abundant cell types, we developed RaceID, an algorithm for rare cell type identification in complex populations of single cells. We demonstrate that this algorithm can resolve cell types represented by only a single cell in a population of randomly sampled organoid cells. We use this algorithm to identify Reg4 as a novel marker for enteroendocrine cells, a rare population of hormone-producing intestinal cells(3). Next, we use Reg4 expression to enrich for these rare cells and investigate the heterogeneity within this population. RaceID confirmed the existence of known enteroendocrine lineages, and moreover discovered novel subtypes, which we subsequently validated in vivo. Having validated RaceID we then applied the algorithm to ex vivo-isolated Lgr5-positive stem cells and their direct progeny. We find that Lgr5-positive cells represent a homogenous abundant population of stem cells mixed with a rare population of Lgr5-positive secretory cells. We envision broad applicability of our method for discovering rare cell types and the corresponding marker genes in healthy and diseased organs.","[Grun, Dominic; Lyubimova, Anna; Kester, Lennart; Wiebrands, Kay; Basak, Onur; Sasaki, Nobuo; Clevers, Hans; van Oudenaarden, Alexander] Royal Netherlands Acad Arts & Sci, Hubrecht Inst KNAW, NL-3584 CT Utrecht, Netherlands; [Grun, Dominic; Lyubimova, Anna; Kester, Lennart; Wiebrands, Kay; Basak, Onur; Sasaki, Nobuo; Clevers, Hans; van Oudenaarden, Alexander] Univ Med Ctr Utrecht, Canc Genom Netherlands, NL-3584 CG Utrecht, Netherlands","van Oudenaarden, A (reprint author), Royal Netherlands Acad Arts & Sci, Hubrecht Inst KNAW, NL-3584 CT Utrecht, Netherlands.",a.vanoudenaarden@hubrecht.eu,,,European Research Council [ERC-AdG 294325-GeneNoiseControl]; Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek (NWO) Vici award,This work was supported by an European Research Council Advanced grant (ERC-AdG 294325-GeneNoiseControl) and a Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek (NWO) Vici award.,,31,157,157,15,84,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,10-Sep,2015,525,7568,,,,,251,+,,10.1038/nature14966,,23,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,CQ9IM,WOS:000360927400039,26287467,No,Y,Y,11/19/17

Analogies between TICs and normal tissue stem cells have led to the proposal that activation of the normal stem-cell program within a tissue serves as the major mechanism for generating TICs3-7. Supporting this notion, we and others previously established that the Slug epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition-inducing transcription factor (EMT-TF), a member of the Snail family, serves as a master regulator of the gland-reconstituting activity of normal mammary stem cells, and that forced expression of Slug in collaboration with Sox9 in breast cancer cells can efficiently induce entrance into the TIC state(8). However, these earlier studies focused on xenograft models with cultured cell lines and involved ectopic expression of EMT-TFs, often at non-physiological levels. Using genetically engineered knock-in reporter mouse lines, here we show that normal gland-reconstituting mammary stem cells(9-11) residing in the basal layer of the mammary epithelium and breast TICs originating in the luminal layer exploit the paralogous EMT-TFs Slug and Snail, respectively, which induce distinct EMT programs. Broadly, our findings suggest that the seemingly similar stem-cell programs operating in TICs and normal stem cells of the corresponding normal tissue are likely to differ significantly in their details.","[Ye, Xin; Tam, Wai Leong; Shibue, Tsukasa; Kaygusuz, Yasemin; Reinhardt, Ferenc; Eaton, Elinor Ng; Weinberg, Robert A.] Whitehead Inst Biomed Res, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; [Tam, Wai Leong] Genome Inst Singapore, Singapore 138672, Singapore; [Tam, Wai Leong] Canc Sci Inst Singapore, Singapore 117599, Singapore; [Weinberg, Robert A.] MIT, Dept Biol, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Weinberg, Robert A.] MIT, Ludwig Ctr Mol Oncol, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA","Ye, X (reprint author), Whitehead Inst Biomed Res, 9 Cambridge Ctr, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA.",xye@wi.mit.edu; weinberg@wi.mit.edu,,,"National Research Foundation, Singapore [NRF-NRFF2015-04]; Breast Cancer Research Foundation; Samuel Waxman Cancer Research Foundation; Ludwig Center for Molecular Oncology at MIT; National Cancer Institute [P01-CA080111, R01-CA078461, U01-CA184897, K99-CA194160]; Wilshire Charitable Foundation/Andria and Paul Heafy Postdoctoral Fellowship; Mattina R.

An equivalent mass of normal cells would be highly heterogeneous as a result of the mutations that occur during each cell division. What is remarkable about cancers is that virtually every neoplastic cell within a large tumour often contains the same core set of genetic alterations, with heterogeneity confined to mutations that emerge late during tumour growth(2-5). How such alterations expand within the spatially constrained three-dimensional architecture of a tumour, and come to dominate a large, pre-existing lesion, has been unclear. Here we describe a model for tumour evolution that shows how short-range dispersal and cell turnover can account for rapid cell mixing inside the tumour. We show that even a small selective advantage of a single cell within a large tumour allows the descendants of that cell to replace the precursor mass in a clinically relevant time frame. We also demonstrate that the same mechanisms can be responsible for the rapid onset of resistance to chemotherapy. Our model not only provides insights into spatial and temporal aspects of tumour growth, but also suggests that targeting short-range cellular migratory activity could have marked effects on tumour growth rates.","[Waclaw, Bartlomiej] Univ Edinburgh, Sch Phys & Astron, Edinburgh EH9 3FD, Midlothian, Scotland; [Bozic, Ivana; Nowak, Martin A.] Harvard Univ, Program Evolutionary Dynam, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Bozic, Ivana; Nowak, Martin A.] Harvard Univ, Dept Math, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Pittman, Meredith E.; Hruban, Ralph H.; Vogelstein, Bert] Johns Hopkins Univ, Sch Med, Dept Pathol, Sol Goldman Pancreat Canc Res Ctr, Baltimore, MD 21231 USA; [Vogelstein, Bert] Ludwig Ctr, Baltimore, MD 21287 USA; [Vogelstein, Bert] Howard Hughes Med Inst, Johns Hopkins Kimmel Canc Ctr, Baltimore, MD 21287 USA; [Nowak, Martin A.] Harvard Univ, Dept Organism & Evolutionary Biol, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA","Nowak, MA (reprint author), Harvard Univ, Program Evolutionary Dynam, 1 Brattle Sq, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",martin_nowak@harvard.edu,"Waclaw, Bartlomiej/F-8928-2012; Bozic, Ivana/C-5003-2008","Waclaw, Bartlomiej/0000-0001-5355-7994; ","John Templeton Foundation; Leverhulme Trust Early-Career Fellowship; Royal Society of Edinburgh Personal Research Fellowship; Foundational Questions in Evolutionary Biology [RFP-12-17]; Virginia and D.K.

The mechanisms underlying the recognition of PSK, the activation of PSKR and the identity of the components downstream of the initial binding remain elusive. Here we report the crystal structures of the extracellular LRR domain of PSKR in free, PSK-and co-receptor-bound forms. The structures reveal that PSK interacts mainly with a b-strand from the island domain of PSKR, forming an anti-b-sheet. The two sulfate moieties of PSK interact directly with PSKR, sensitizing PSKR recognition of PSK. Supported by biochemical, structural and genetic evidence, PSK binding enhances PSKR heterodimerization with the somatic embryogenesis receptor-like kinases (SERKs). However, PSK is not directly involved in PSKR-SERK interaction but stabilizes PSKR island domain for recruitment of a SERK.

Keymediators of jasmonate signalling include MYC transcription factors, which are repressed by jasmonate ZIM-domain (JAZ) transcriptional repressors in the resting state. In the presence of active jasmonate, JAZ proteins function as jasmonate co-receptors by forming a hormone-dependent complex with COI1, the F-box subunit of an SCF-type ubiquitin E3 ligase(8-11). The hormone-dependent formation of the COI1-JAZ co-receptor complex leads to ubiquitination and proteasome-dependent degradation of JAZ repressors and release of MYC proteins from transcriptional repression(3,10,12). The mechanism by which JAZ proteins repress MYC transcription factors and how JAZ proteins switch between the repressor function in the absence of hormone and the co-receptor function in the presence of hormone remain enigmatic. Here we show that Arabidopsis MYC3 undergoes pronounced conformational changes when bound to the conserved Jas motif of the JAZ9 repressor. The Jas motif, previously shown to bind to hormone as a partly unwound helix, forms a complete alpha-helix that displaces the amino (N)-terminal helix ofMYC3 and becomes an integral part of theMYC N-terminal fold. In this position, the Jas helix competitively inhibits MYC3 interaction with the MED25 subunit of the transcriptional Mediator complex. Our structural and functional studies elucidate a dynamic molecular switchmechanism that governs the repression and activation of a major plant hormone pathway.","[Zhang, Feng; Ke, Jiyuan; Zhou, X.

Here we have assembled a 32-protein, 1.5-megadalton PIC5 derived from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and observe subsequent initiation processes in real time with optical tweezers(6). Contrary to expectation, scanning driven by the transcription factor IIH7-12 involved the rapid opening of an extended transcription bubble, averaging 85 base pairs, accompanied by the synthesis of a transcript up to the entire length of the extended bubble, followed by promoter escape. PICs that failed to achieve promoter escape nevertheless formed open complexes and extended bubbles, which collapsed back to closed or open complexes, resulting in repeated futile scanning.","[Fazal, Furqan M.; Block, Steven M.] Stanford Univ, Dept Appl Phys, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Meng, Cong A.] Stanford Univ, Dept Chem, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Murakami, Kenji; Kornberg, Roger D.] Stanford Univ, Dept Biol Struct, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Block, Steven M.] Stanford Univ, Dept Biol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA","Block, SM (reprint author), Stanford Univ, Dept Appl Phys, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",kornberg@stanford.edu; sblock@stanford.edu,"Meng, Cong A./I-1461-2017","Meng, Cong A./0000-0002-5352-6095; Fazal, Furqan/0000-0003-0758-4582","NIH [GM36659, AI21144, GM57035]; NSF","We thank A.

Recent studies support an HRE RNA gain-of-function mechanism of neurotoxicity, and we previously identified protein interactors for the G(4)C(2) RNA including RanGAP1. A candidate-based genetic screen in Drosophila expressing 30G(4)C(2) repeats identified RanGAP (Drosophila orthologue of human RanGAP1), a key regulator of nucleocytoplasmic transport, as a potent suppressor of neurodegeneration. Enhancing nuclear import or suppressing nuclear export of proteins also suppresses neurodegeneration. RanGAP physically interacts with HRE RNA and is mislocalized in HRE-expressing flies, neurons from C9orf72 ALS patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC-derived neurons), and in C9orf72 ALS patient brain tissue. Nuclear import is impaired as a result of HRE expression in the fly model and in C9orf72 iPSC-derived neurons, and these deficits are rescued by small molecules and antisense oligonucleotides targeting the HRE G-quadruplexes. Nucleocytoplasmic transport defects may be a fundamental pathway for ALS and FTD that is amenable to pharmacotherapeutic intervention.","[Zhang, Ke; Machamer, James B.; Cunningham, Kathleen M.; Gupta, Saksham; Ostrow, Lyle W.; Lloyd, Thomas E.] Johns Hopkins Univ, Dept Neurol, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA; [Donnelly, Christopher J.; Grima, Jonathan C.; Daley, Elizabeth L.; Miller, Sean J.; Vidensky, Svetlana; Thomas, Michael A.; Sattler, Rita; Rothstein, Jeffrey D.] Johns Hopkins Univ, Sch Med, Brain Sci Inst, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA; [Haeusler, Aaron R.; Steinwald, Peter; Matunis, Michael J.; Wang, Jiou] Johns Hopkins Univ, Bloomberg Sch Publ Hlth, Biochem & Mol Biol, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA; [Grima, Jonathan C.; Hong, Ingie; Chiu, Shu-Ling; Huganir, Richard L.; Lloyd, Thomas E.; Rothstein, Jeffrey D.] Johns Hopkins Univ, Sch Med, Dept Neurosci, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA","Rothstein, JD (reprint author), Johns Hopkins Univ, Sch Med, Brain Sci Inst, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA.",tlloyd4@jhmi.edu; jrothstein@jhmi.edu,"Chiu, Shu-Ling/F-3613-2014","Chiu, Shu-Ling/0000-0003-4429-7830; Donnelly, Christopher /0000-0002-2383-9015; Matunis, Michael/0000-0002-9350-6611; Lloyd, Thomas/0000-0003-4756-3700; Daley, Elizabeth/0000-0003-2342-452X","NIH [R01NS085207, NS091046, R01 NS082563, R01 NS074324, NS089616, CA009110]; Brain Science Institute; Robert Packard Center for ALS Research at Johns Hopkins; Muscular Dystrophy Association; Alzheimer's Drug Discovery Foundation; Judith and Jean Pape Adams Charitable Foundation; Alzheimer's Disease Research Center - Johns Hopkins; Maryland TEDCO; Target ALS Springboard Fellowship; William and Ella Owens Foundation; ALS Association; NIH K99 award [NS091486]; National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship; Thomas Shortman Training Fund Graduate Scholarship","We thank S.

Here we report atomic-resolution crystal structures of Ca2+- and Mg2+-bound complexes between synaptotagmin-1 and the neuronal SNARE complex, one of which was determined with diffraction data froman X-ray free-electron laser, leading to an atomic-resolution structure with accurate rotamer assignments for many side chains. The structures reveal several interfaces, including a large, specific, Ca2+-independent and conserved interface. Tests of this interface by mutagenesis suggest that it is essential for Ca2+-triggered neurotransmitter release in mouse hippocampal neuronal synapses and for Ca2+-triggered vesicle fusion in a reconstituted system. We propose that this interface forms before Ca2+ triggering, moves en bloc as Ca2+ influx promotes the interactions between synaptotagmin-1 and the plasma membrane, and consequently remodels the membrane to promote fusion, possibly in conjunction with other interfaces.","[Zhou, Qiangjun; Lai, Ying; Bacaj, Taulant; Zhao, Minglei; Lyubimov, Artem Y.; Uervirojnangkoorn, Monarin; Zeldin, Oliver B.; Pfuetzner, Richard A.; Choi, Ucheor B.; Diao, Jiajie; Suedhof, Thomas C.; Brunger, Axel T.] Stanford Univ, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Dept Mol & Cellular Physiol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Zhou, Qiangjun; Lai, Ying; Zhao, Minglei; Lyubimov, Artem Y.; Uervirojnangkoorn, Monarin; Zeldin, Oliver B.; Pfuetzner, Richard A.; Choi, Ucheor B.; Diao, Jiajie; Brunger, Axel T.] Stanford Univ, Dept Neurol & Neurol Sci, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Zhou, Qiangjun; Lai, Ying; Zhao, Minglei; Lyubimov, Artem Y.; Uervirojnangkoorn, Monarin; Zeldin, Oliver B.; Pfuetzner, Richard A.; Choi, Ucheor B.; Weis, William I.; Diao, Jiajie; Brunger, Axel T.] Stanford Univ, Dept Photon Sci, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Zhou, Qiangjun; Lai, Ying; Zhao, Minglei; Lyubimov, Artem Y.; Uervirojnangkoorn, Monarin; Zeldin, Oliver B.; Pfuetzner, Richard A.; Choi, Ucheor B.; Weis, William I.; Diao, Jiajie; Brunger, Axel T.] Stanford Univ, Dept Struct Biol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Brewster, Aaron S.; Sauter, Nicholas K.] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Phys Biosci Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Cohen, Aina E.; Soltis, S.

Here we determine the crystal structure of the 240-kilodalton Escherichia coli C-P lyase core complex (PhnG-PhnH-PhnI-PhnJ; PhnGHIJ), and show that it is a two-fold symmetric hetero-octamer comprising an intertwined network of subunits with unexpected self-homologies. It contains two potential active sites that probably couple phosphonate compounds to ATP and subsequently hydrolyse the C-P bond.

The highest T-c that has been achieved to date is in the copper oxide system(1): 133 kelvin at ambient pressure(2) and 164 kelvin at high pressures(3). As the nature of superconductivity in these materials is still not fully understood (they are not conventional superconductors), the prospects for achieving still higher transition temperatures by this route are not clear. In contrast, the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer theory of conventional superconductivity gives a guide for achieving high T-c with no theoretical upper bound-all that is needed is a favourable combination of high-frequency phonons, strong electron-phonon coupling, and a high density of states(4). These conditions can in principle be fulfilled for metallic hydrogen and covalent compounds dominated by hydrogen(5,6), as hydrogen atoms provide the necessary high-frequency phonon modes as well as the strong electron-phonon coupling. Numerous calculations support this idea and have predicted transition temperatures in the range 50-235 kelvin for many hydrides(7), but only a moderate T-c of 17 kelvin has been observed experimentally(8). Here we investigate sulfur hydride(9), where a T-c of 80 kelvin has been predicted(10). We find that this system transforms to a metal at a pressure of approximately 90 gigapascals. On cooling, we see signatures of superconductivity: a sharp drop of the resistivity to zero and a decrease of the transition temperature with magnetic field, with magnetic susceptibility measurements confirming a T-c of 203 kelvin. Moreover, a pronounced isotope shift of T-c in sulfur deuteride is suggestive of an electron-phonon mechanism of superconductivity that is consistent with the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer scenario. We argue that the phase responsible for high-T-c superconductivity in this system is likely to be H3S, formed from H2S by decomposition under pressure. These findings raise hope for the prospects for achieving room-temperature superconductivity in other hydrogen-based materials.","[Drozdov, A. P.; Eremets, M. I.; Troyan, I.

One of the most interesting of these is the ability to achieve superlensing-that is, to focus or image beyond the diffraction limit(7). This originates from the left-handed behaviour-the property of refracting waves negatively-that is typical of negative index metamaterials(8-10). Yet reaching this goal requires the design of 'double negative' metamaterials, which act simultaneously on the permittivity and permeability in electromagnetics(11,12), or on the density and compressibility in acoustics; this generally implies the use of two different kinds of building blocks(13,14) or specific particles presenting multiple overlapping resonances(15-17). Such a requirement limits the applicability of double negative metamaterials, and has, for example, hampered any demonstration of subwavelength focusing using left-handed acoustic metamaterials(18). Here we show that these strict conditions can be largely relaxed by relying on media that consist of only one type of single resonant unit cell. Specifically, we show with a simple yet general semi-analytical model that judiciously breaking the symmetry of a single negative metamaterial is sufficient to turn it into a double negative one. We then demonstrate that this occurs solely because of multiple scattering of waves off the metamaterial resonant elements, a phenomenon often disregarded in these media owing to their subwavelength patterning. We apply our approach to acoustics and verify through numerical simulations that it allows the realization of negative index acoustic metamaterials based on Helmholtz resonators only. Finally, we demonstrate the operation of a negative index acoustic superlens, achieving subwavelength focusing and imaging with spot width and resolution 7 and 3.5 times better than the diffraction limit, respectively. Our findings have profound implications for the physics of metamaterials, highlighting the role of their subwavelength crystalline structure, and hence entering the realm of metamaterial crystals. This widens the scope of possibilities for designing composite media with novel properties in a much simpler way than has been possible so far.","[Kaina, Nadege; Lemoult, Fabrice; Fink, Mathias; Lerosey, Geoffroy] ESPCI ParisTech, Inst Langevin, F-75005 Paris, France; [Kaina, Nadege; Lemoult, Fabrice; Fink, Mathias; Lerosey, Geoffroy] CNRS, UMR 7587, F-75005 Paris, France","Lerosey, G (reprint author), ESPCI ParisTech, Inst Langevin, 1 Rue Jussieu, F-75005 Paris, France.",geoffroy.lerosey@espci.fr,"fink, mathias/M-9437-2016",,"LABEX WIFI (Laboratory of Excellence within the French Program ""Investments for the Future"") [ANR-10-LABX-24, ANR-10-IDEX-0001-02 PSL*]; Agence Nationale de la Recherche [ANR-13-JS09-0001-01]; French ""Direction Generale de l'Armement""","We thank A.

Its guiding design principle is that the target structure is the single most stable configuration(5). The folding transition is cooperative(4,6,7) and, as in the case of proteins, is governed by information encoded in the polymer sequence(8-11). A typical origami folds primarily into the desired shape, but misfolded structures can kinetically trap the system and reduce the yield(2). Although adjusting assembly conditions(2,12) or following empirical design rules(12,13) can improve yield, well-folded origami often need to be separated from misfolded structures(2,3,14-16). The problem could in principle be avoided if assembly pathway and kinetics were fully understood and then rationally optimized. To this end, here we present a DNA origami system with the unusual property of being able to form a small set of distinguishable and well-folded shapes that represent discrete and approximately degenerate energy minima in a vast folding landscape, thus allowing us to probe the assembly process. The obtained high yield of well-folded origami structures confirms the existence of efficient folding pathways, while the shape distribution provides information about individual trajectories through the folding landscape. We find that, similarly to protein folding, the assembly of DNA origami is highly cooperative; that reversible bond formation is important in recovering from transient misfoldings; and that the early formation of long-range connections can very effectively enforce particular folds. We use these insights to inform the design of the system so as to steer assembly towards desired structures. Expanding the rational design process to include the assembly pathway should thus enable more reproducible synthesis, particularly when targeting more complex structures. We anticipate that this expansion will be essential if DNA origami is to continue its rapid development(1-3,17-19) and become a reliable manufacturing technology(20).","[Dunn, Katherine E.; Dannenberg, Frits; Turberfield, Andrew J.; Bath, Jonathan] Univ Oxford, Dept Phys, Clarendon Lab, Oxford OX1 3PU, England; [Dannenberg, Frits; Kwiatkowska, Marta] Univ Oxford, Dept Comp Sci, Oxford OX1 3QD, England; [Ouldridge, Thomas E.] Univ Oxford, Dept Phys, Rudolf Peierls Ctr Theoret Phys, Oxford OX1 3NP, England","Bath, J (reprint author), Univ Oxford, Dept Phys, Clarendon Lab, Parks Rd, Oxford OX1 3PU, England.",a.turberfield@physics.ox.ac.uk; j.bath@physics.ox.ac.uk,"Turberfield, Andrew/O-2135-2017","Turberfield, Andrew/0000-0002-3876-0190; Kwiatkowska, Marta/0000-0001-9022-7599","Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council [EP/G037930/1, EP/P504287/1]; Human Frontier Science Program [RGP0030/2013]; Microsoft Research PhD Scholarship; ERC Advanced Grant VERIWARE; Royal Society-Wolfson Research Merit Award","We thank K.V.

One of the core principles underlying DNA biosynthesis is the radical-mediated elimination of H2O to deoxygenate ribonucleotides, an example of 'spin-centre shift'(2), during which an alcohol C-O bond is cleaved, resulting in a carbon-centred radical intermediate. Although spin-centre shift is a well-understood biochemical process, it is underused by the synthetic organic chemistry community. We wondered whether it would be possible to take advantage of this naturally occurring process to accomplish mild, non-traditional alkylation reactions using alcohols as radical precursors. Because conventional radical-based alkylation methods require the use of stoichiometric oxidants, increased temperatures or peroxides(3-7), a mild protocol using simple and abundant alkylating agents would have considerable use in the synthesis of diversely functionalized pharmacophores. Here we describe the development of a dual catalytic alkylation of heteroarenes, using alcohols as mild alkylating reagents. This method represents the first, to our knowledge, broadly applicable use of unactivated alcohols as latent alkylating reagents, achieved via the successful merger of photoredox and hydrogen atom transfer catalysis. The value of this multi-catalytic protocol has been demonstrated through the late-stage functionalization of the medicinal agents, fasudil and milrinone.","[Jin, Jian; MacMillan, David W.

However, recent work in Oregon(1) and Mexico(2) has shown evidence of ecohydrological separation, whereby different subsurface compartmentalized pools of water supply either plant transpiration fluxes or the combined fluxes of groundwater and streamflow. These findings have not yet been widely tested. Here we use hydrogen and oxygen isotopic data (H-2/H-1 (delta H-2) and O-18/O-16 (delta O-18)) from 47 globally distributed sites to show that ecohydrological separation is widespread across different biomes. Precipitation, stream water and groundwater from each site plot approximately along the delta H-2/delta O-18 slope of local precipitation inputs. But soil and plant xylem waters extracted from the 47 sites all plot below the local stream water and groundwater on the meteoric water line, suggesting that plants use soil water that does not itself contribute to groundwater recharge or streamflow. Our results further show that, at 80% of the sites, the precipitation that supplies groundwater recharge and streamflow is different from the water that supplies parts of soil water recharge and plant transpiration. The ubiquity of subsurface water compartmentalization found here, and the segregation of storm types relative to hydrological and ecological fluxes, may be used to improve numerical simulations of runoff generation, stream water transit time and evaporation-transpiration partitioning. Future land surface model parameterizations should be closely examined for how vegetation, groundwater recharge and streamflow are assumed to be coupled.","[Evaristo, Jaivime; McDonnell, Jeffrey J.] Univ Saskatchewan, Global Inst Water Secur, Saskatoon, SK S7N 3H5, Canada; [Evaristo, Jaivime; McDonnell, Jeffrey J.] Univ Saskatchewan, Sch Environm & Sustainabil, Saskatoon, SK S7N 3H5, Canada; [Jasechko, Scott] Univ Calgary, Dept Geog, Calgary, AB T2N 1N4, Canada; [McDonnell, Jeffrey J.] Univ Aberdeen, Sch Geosci, Aberdeen AB34 3FX, Scotland; [McDonnell, Jeffrey J.] Oregon State Univ, Dept Forest Engn Resources & Management, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA","Evaristo, J (reprint author), Univ Saskatchewan, Global Inst Water Secur, Saskatoon, SK S7N 3H5, Canada.",jaivime.evaristo@usask.ca,,"Evaristo, Jaivime/0000-0003-1387-229X","Saskatchewan Innovation and Opportunity Scholarship; Global Institute for Water Security; School of Environment and Sustainability (University of Saskatchewan); Saskatchewan Innovation and Opportunity Scholarship, Global Institute for Water Security, and School of Environment and Sustainability (University of Saskatchewan)","J.E. thanks the Saskatchewan Innovation and Opportunity Scholarship, Global Institute for Water Security, and School of Environment and Sustainability (University of Saskatchewan) for financial support.",,89,66,66,40,346,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,3-Sep,2015,525,7567,,,,,91,+,,10.1038/nature14983,,16,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,CQ4SE,WOS:000360594100031,26333467,No,Y,N,11/19/17

On the basis of geodynamic computations, plumes of purely thermal origin should comprise thin tails, only several hundred kilometres wide(3), and be difficult to detect using standard seismic tomography techniques. Here we describe the use of a whole-mantle seismic imaging technique-combining accurate wavefield computations with information contained in whole seismic waveforms(4)-that reveals the presence of broad (not thin), quasi-vertical conduits beneath many prominent hotspots. These conduits extend from the core-mantle boundary to about 1,000 kilometres below Earth's surface, where some are deflected horizontally, as though entrained into more vigorous upper-mantle circulation. At the base of the mantle, these conduits are rooted in patches of greatly reduced shear velocity that, in the case of Hawaii, Iceland and Samoa, correspond to the locations of known large ultralow-velocity zones(5-7). This correspondence clearly establishes a continuous connection between such zones and mantle plumes. We also show that the imaged conduits are robustly broader than classical thermal plume tails, suggesting that they are long-lived(8), and may have a thermochemical origin(9-11). Their vertical orientation suggests very sluggish background circulation below depths of 1,000 kilometres. Our results should provide constraints on studies of viscosity layering of Earth's mantle and guide further research into thermochemical convection.","[French, Scott W.; Romanowicz, Barbara] Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley Seismol Lab, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Romanowicz, Barbara] Inst Phys Globe, F-75238 Paris, France; [Romanowicz, Barbara] Coll France, F-75005 Paris, France","Romanowicz, B (reprint author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley Seismol Lab, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",barbara@seismo.berkeley.edu,"Romanowicz, barbara/H-6726-2017","Romanowicz, barbara/0000-0002-6208-6044",NSF Graduate Research Fellowship; NSF [EAR-1417229]; ERC Advanced Grant WAVETOMO; US Department of Energy Office of Science [DE-AC02-05CH11231],"We thank the IRIS Data Management Center for providing the waveform data used in this study.

One defining feature of the Anthropocene epoch(1,2) is the erosion of biogeographical barriers by human-mediated dispersal of species into new regions, where they can naturalize and cause ecological, economic and social damage(3). So far, no comprehensive analysis of the global accumulation and exchange of alien plant species between continents has been performed, primarily because of a lack of data. Here we bridge this knowledge gap by using a unique global database on the occurrences of naturalized alien plant species in 481 mainland and 362 island regions. In total, 13,168 plant species, corresponding to 3.9% of the extant global vascular flora, or approximately the size of the native European flora, have become naturalized somewhere on the globe as a result of human activity. North America has accumulated the largest number of naturalized species, whereas the Pacific Islands show the fastest increase in species numbers with respect to their land area. Continents in the Northern Hemisphere have been the major donors of naturalized alien species to all other continents.

However, some morphological studies have suggested a more complex picture, whereby the northeast Asian affinities of present-day Native Americans contrast with a distinctive morphology seen in some of the earliest American skeletons, which share traits with present-day Australasians (indigenous groups in Australia, Melanesia, and island Southeast Asia)(5-8). Here we analyse genome-wide data to show that some Amazonian Native Americans descend partly from a Native American founding population that carried ancestry more closely related to indigenous Australians, New Guineans and Andaman Islanders than to any present-day Eurasians or Native Americans. This signature is not present to the same extent, or at all, in present-day Northern and Central Americans or in a similar to 12,600-year-old Clovis-associated genome, suggesting a more diverse set of founding populations of the Americas than previously accepted.","[Skoglund, Pontus; Mallick, Swapan; Chennagiri, Niru; Reich, David] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Genet, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Skoglund, Pontus; Mallick, Swapan; Chennagiri, Niru; Patterson, Nick; Reich, David] Broad Inst Harvard & MIT, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; [Mallick, Swapan; Reich, David] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Bortolini, Maria Catira; Salzano, Francisco Mauro] Univ Fed Rio Grande do Sul, Inst Biociencias, BR-91501970 Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil; [Huenemeier, Tabita] Univ Sao Paulo, Dept Genet Biol Evolut, BR-05508090 Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil; [Petzl-Erler, Maria Luiza] Univ Fed Parana, Dept Genet, BR-81531980 Curitiba, PR, Brazil","Skoglund, P (reprint author), Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Genet, Boston, MA 02115 USA.",skoglund@genetics.med.harvard.edu; reich@genetics.med.harvard.edu,"Salzano, Francisco/L-7916-2015; Petzl-Erler, Maria-Luiza/H-8221-2012","Petzl-Erler, Maria-Luiza/0000-0002-0345-5276; Skoglund, Pontus/0000-0002-3021-5913",Conselho Nacional do Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (Brazil); Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (Brazil); Wenner-Gren foundation; Swedish Research Council (VR) [2014-453]; US National Science Foundation HOMINID [BCS-1032255]; US National Institutes of Health [GM100233]; Simons Foundation [280376]; Howard Hughes Medical Institute,"We are grateful to the Native American volunteers who contributed the DNA samples used to generate the new data reported in this study and to the Fundacao Nacional do Indio (FUNAI, Brazil) for logistical support in sample collection.

It can manifest as mitral regurgitation and is the leading indication for mitral valve surgery(4,5). Despite a clear heritable component, the genetic aetiology leading to non-syndromic MVP has remained elusive. Four affected individuals from a large multigenerational family segregating non-syndromic MVP underwent capture sequencing of the linked interval on chromosome 11. We report a missense mutation in the DCHS1 gene, the human homologue of the Drosophila cell polarity gene dachsous (ds), that segregates with MVP in the family. Morpholino knockdown of the zebrafish homologue dachsous1b resulted in a cardiac atrioventricular canal defect that could be rescued by wild-type human DCHS1, but not by DCHS1 messenger RNA with the familial mutation. Further genetic studies identified two additional families in which a second deleterious DCHS1 mutation segregates with MVP. Both DCHS1 mutations reduce protein stability as demonstrated in zebrafish, cultured cells and, notably, in mitral valve interstitial cells (MVICs) obtained during mitral valve repair surgery of a proband. Dchs1(+/-) mice had prolapse of thickened mitral leaflets, which could be traced back to developmental errors in valve morphogenesis. DCHS1 deficiency in MVP patient MVICs, as well as in Dchs1(+/-) mouse MVICs, result in altered migration and cellular patterning, supporting these processes as aetiological underpinnings for the disease. Understanding the role of DCHS1 in mitral valve development and MVP pathogenesis holds potential for therapeutic insights for this very common disease.","[Durst, Ronen; Leyne, Maire; Salani, Monica; Talkowski, Michael E.;

A key issue in breast cancer biology is the effect of genomic lesions in specific mammary cell lineages on tumour heterogeneity and progression. The impact of transforming events on fate conversion in cancer cells of origin and thus their contribution to tumour heterogeneity remains largely elusive. Using in situ genetic lineage tracing and limiting dilution transplantation, we have unravelled the potential of PIK3CA(H1047R), one of the most frequent mutations occurring in human breast cancer(5), to induce multipotency during tumorigenesis in the mammary gland. Here we show that expression of PIK3CA(H1047R) in lineage-committed basal Lgr5-positive and luminal keratin-8-positive cells of the adult mouse mammary gland evokes cell dedifferentiation into a multipotent stem-like state, suggesting this to be a mechanism involved in the formation of heterogeneous, multi-lineage mammary tumours. Moreover, we show that the tumour cell of origin influences the frequency of malignant mammary tumours. Our results define a key effect of PIK3CA(H1047R) on mammary cell fate in the pre-neoplastic mammary gland and show that the cell of origin of PIK3CA(H1047R) tumours dictates their malignancy, thus revealing a mechanism underlying tumour heterogeneity and aggressiveness.","[Koren, Shany; Reavie, Linsey; Couto, Joana Pinto; De Silva, Duvini; Stadler, Michael B.; Roloff, Tim; Britschgi, Adrian; Eichlisberger, Tobias; Kohler, Hubertus; Bentires-Alj, Mohamed] Friedrich Miescher Inst Biomed Res FMI, CH-4058 Basel, Switzerland; [Stadler, Michael B.] Swiss Inst Bioinformat, CH-4058 Basel, Switzerland; [Aina, Olulanu; Cardiff, Robert D.] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Pathol, Ctr Comparat Med, Davis, CA 95616 USA","Bentires-Alj, M (reprint author), Friedrich Miescher Inst Biomed Res FMI, CH-4058 Basel, Switzerland.",Bentires@fmi.ch,,,National Cancer Institute [U01 CA141582]; Novartis Research Foundation; European Research Council (ERC) [243211-PTPsBDC]; Swiss Cancer League; Swiss National Foundation; Krebsliga Beider Basel,"The authors thank R.

PIK3CA and P53 (also known as TP53) are the two most frequently mutated genes and are associated with different types of human breast cancers(3). The cellular origin and the mechanisms leading to PIK3CA-induced tumour heterogeneity remain unknown. Here we used a genetic approach in mice to define the cellular origin of Pik3ca-derived tumours and the impact of mutations in this gene on tumour heterogeneity. Surprisingly, oncogenic Pik3ca(H1047R) mutant expression at physiological levels(4) in basal cells using keratin (K)5-CreER(T2) mice induced the formation of luminal oestrogen receptor (ER)-positive/progesterone receptor (PR)-positive tumours, while its expression in luminal cells using K8-CReERT2 mice gave rise to luminal ER+PR+ tumours or basal-like ER-PR- tumours. Concomitant deletion of p53 and expression of Pik3ca(H1047R) accelerated tumour development and induced more aggressive mammary tumours. Interestingly, expression of Pik3ca(H1047R) in unipotent basal cells gave rise to luminal-like cells, while its expression in unipotent luminal cells gave rise to basal-like cells before progressing into invasive tumours. Transcriptional profiling of cells that underwent cell fate transition upon Pik3ca(H1047R) expression in unipotent progenitors demonstrated a profound oncogene-induced reprogramming of these newly formed cells and identified gene signatures characteristic of the different cell fate switches that occur upon Pik3ca(H1047R) expression in basal and luminal cells, which correlated with the cell of origin, tumour type and different clinical outcomes. Altogether our study identifies the cellular origin of Pik3ca-induced tumours and reveals that oncogenic Pik3ca(H1047R) activates a multipotent genetic program in normally lineage-restricted populations at the early stage of tumour initiation, setting the stage for future intratumoural heterogeneity. These results have important implications for our understanding of the mechanisms controlling tumour heterogeneity and the development of new strategies to block PIK3CA breast cancer initiation.","[Van Keymeulen, Alexandra; Lee, May Yin; Ousset, Marielle; Giraddi, Rajshekhar R.; Wuidart, Aline; Bouvencourt, Gaelle; Dubois, Christine; Blanpain, Cedric] Univ Libre Bruxelles, IRIBHM, B-1070 Brussels, Belgium; [Brohee, Sylvain; Sotiriou, Christos] Univ Libre Bruxelles, Inst Jules Bordet, B-1000 Brussels, Belgium; [Rorive, Sandrine; Salmon, Isabelle] Univ Libre Bruxelles, Erasme Hosp, Dept Pathol, B-1070 Brussels, Belgium; [Rorive, Sandrine; Salmon, Isabelle] CMMI, DIAPATH, B-6041 Gosselies, Belgium; [Phillips, Wayne A.] Peter MacCallum Canc Ctr, Surg Oncol Res Lab, Melbourne, Vic 3002, Australia; [Phillips, Wayne A.] Univ Melbourne, Sir Peter MacCallum Dept Oncol, Parkville, Vic 3002, Australia; [Blanpain, Cedric] Univ Libre Bruxelles, WELBIO, B-1070 Brussels, Belgium","Blanpain, C (reprint author), Univ Libre Bruxelles, IRIBHM, B-1070 Brussels, Belgium.",avkeymeu@ulb.ac.be; Cedric.Blanpain@ulb.ac.be,"Phillips, Wayne/H-8070-2013","Phillips, Wayne/0000-0002-7961-638X","Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*STAR, Singapore); FNRS; TELEVIE; foundation ""Amis de l'institut Jules Bordet""; European Regional Development Fund; Wallonia; National Health and Medical Research Council of Australia; Fondation Contre le Cancer; ULB fondation; Fond Yvonne Boel; Fond Gaston Ithier; foundation Bettencourt Schueller; foundation Baillet Latour; European Research Council","C.B. is an investigator of WELBIO, A.V.K. is Chercheur Qualifie of the FNRS, C.S. is Maitre de Recherche of the FNRS, M.Y.L. is supported by the Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*STAR, Singapore) fellowship, M.O. and A.W. are supported by FNRS fellowships, R.R.G. is supported by a TELEVIE fellowship and S.B. is supported by the foundation ""Amis de l'institut Jules Bordet"".

Mitochondrial dysfunction has been linked to neurodegenerative diseases, cancer and ageing(4). Although transcriptional mechanisms that regulate mitochondrial abundance are known(5), comparatively little is known about how mitochondrial function is regulated. Here we identify the metabolite stearic acid (C18:0) and human transferrin receptor 1 (TFR1; also known as TFRC) as mitochondrial regulators. We elucidate a signalling pathway whereby C18:0 stearoylates TFR1, thereby inhibiting its activation of JNK signalling. This leads to reduced ubiquitination of mitofusin via HUWE1, thereby promoting mitochondrial fusion and function. We find that animal cells are poised to respond to both increases and decreases in C18:0 levels, with increased C18:0 dietary intake boosting mitochondrial fusion in vivo. Intriguingly, dietary C18:0 supplementation can counteract the mitochondrial dysfunction caused by genetic defects such as loss of the Parkinson's disease genes Pink or Parkin in Drosophila. This work identifies the metabolite C18:0 as a signalling molecule regulating mitochondrial function in response to diet.","[Senyilmaz, Deniz; Xu, Xiaojun; Miller, Aubry K.; Teleman, Aurelio A.] German Canc Res Ctr, D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany; [Virtue, Sam; Tan, Chong Yew; Vidal-Puig, Antonio] Univ Cambridge, Metab Res Labs, Wellcome Trust MRC Inst Metab Sci, Cambridge CB2 0QQ, England; [Griffin, Julian L.] Dept Biochem, Cambridge CB2 1GA, England; [Vidal-Puig, Antonio] Wellcome Trust Sanger Inst, Hinxton CB10 1SA, Cambs, England","Teleman, AA (reprint author), German Canc Res Ctr, D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany.",a.teleman@dkfz.de,"Teleman, Aurelio/E-6864-2013","Teleman, Aurelio/0000-0002-4237-9368; Miller, Aubry/0000-0002-1761-4143",Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) [SFB1118]; Helmholtz Portfolio Topic 'Metabolic Dysfunction'; European Research Council [260602]; Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council; Medical Research Council; British Heart Foundation,"We thank A.

The basis for pathogenesis is unknown. To elucidate the consequences of G(4)C(2) repeat expansion in a tractable genetic system, we generated transgenic fly lines expressing 8, 28 or 58 G(4)C(2)-repeat-containing transcripts that do not have a translation start site (AUG) but contain an open-reading frame for green fluorescent protein to detect repeat-associated non-AUG (RAN) translation. We show that these transgenic animals display dosage-dependent, repeat-length-dependent degeneration in neuronal tissues and RAN translation of dipeptide repeat (DPR) proteins, as observed in patients with C9orf72-related disease. This model was used in a large-scale, unbiased genetic screen, ultimately leading to the identification of 18 genetic modifiers that encode components of the nuclear pore complex (NPC), as well as the machinery that coordinates the export of nuclear RNA and the import of nuclear proteins. Consistent with these results, we found morphological abnormalities in the architecture of the nuclear envelope in cells expressing expanded G(4)C(2) repeats in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, we identified a substantial defect in RNA export resulting in retention of RNA in the nuclei of Drosophila cells expressing expanded G(4)C(2) repeats and also in mammalian cells, including aged induced pluripotent stem-cell-derived neurons from patients with C9orf72-related disease. These studies show that a primary consequence of G(4)C(2) repeat expansion is the compromise of nucleocytoplasmic transport through the nuclear pore, revealing a novel mechanism of neurodegeneration.","[Freibaum, Brian D.; Kim, Nam Chul; Lee, Kyung-Ha; Badders, Nisha; Valentine, Marc; Kim, Hong Joo] St Jude Childrens Res Hosp, Dept Cell & Mol Biol, Memphis, TN 38105 USA; [Lu, Yubing; Lopez-Gonzalez, Rodrigo; Almeida, Sandra; Gao, Fen-Biao] Univ Massachusetts, Dept Neurol, Sch Med, Worcester, MA 01605 USA; [Miller, Bruce L.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Neurol, Memory & Aging Ctr, San Francisco, CA 94158 USA; [Wong, Philip C.] Johns Hopkins Univ, Dept Pathol, Sch Med, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA; [Petrucelli, Leonard] Mayo Clin, Dept Neurosci, Jacksonville, FL 32224 USA; [Taylor, J.

In mice, six additional sets of constant region exons (C(H)s) lie 100-200 kilobases downstream in the same transcriptional orientation as V(D) J and C mu exons(2). Long repetitive switch (S) regions precede C mu and downstream C(H)s. In mature B cells, class switch recombination (CSR) generates different antibody classes by replacing C mu with a downstream C-H (ref. 2). Activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) initiates CSR by promoting deamination lesions within S mu and a downstream acceptor S region(2,3); these lesions are converted into DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) by general DNA repair factors(3). Productive CSR must occur in a deletional orientation by joining the upstream end of an S mu DSB to the downstream end of an acceptor S-region DSB. However, the relative frequency of deletional to inversional CSR junctions has not been measured. Thus, whether orientation-specific joining is a programmed mechanistic feature of CSR as it is for V(D) J recombination and, if so, how this is achieved is unknown. To address this question, we adapt high-throughput genome-wide translocation sequencing(4) into a highly sensitive DSB end-joining assay and apply it to endogenous AID-initiated S-region DSBs in mouse B cells. We show that CSR is programmed to occur in a productive deletional orientation and does so via an unprecedented mechanism that involves in cis Igh organizational features in combination with frequent S-region DSBs initiated by AID. We further implicate ATM-dependent DSB-response factors in enforcing this mechanism and provide an explanation of why CSR is so reliant on the 53BP1 DSB-response factor.","[Dong, Junchao; Panchakshari, Rohit A.; Zhang, Tingting; Zhang, Yu; Hu, Jiazhi; Meyers, Robin M.; Ho, Yu-Jui; Du, Zhou; Meng, Feilong; Gostissa, Monica; Alt, Frederick W.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Boston Childrens Hosp, Howard Hughes Med Inst,Program Cellular & Mol Med, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Dong, Junchao; Panchakshari, Rohit A.; Zhang, Tingting; Zhang, Yu; Hu, Jiazhi; Meyers, Robin M.; Ho, Yu-Jui; Du, Zhou; Meng, Feilong; Gostissa, Monica; Alt, Frederick W.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Genet, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Volpi, Sabrina A.; Manis, John P.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Boston Childrens Hosp, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Volpi, Sabrina A.; Manis, John P.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Joint Program Transfus Med, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Robbiani, Davide F.; Nussenzweig, Michel C.] Rockefeller Univ, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Lab Mol Immunol, New York, NY 10065 USA","Alt, FW (reprint author), Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Boston Childrens Hosp, Howard Hughes Med Inst,Program Cellular & Mol Med, Boston, MA 02115 USA.",manis@enders.tch.harvard.edu; alt@enders.tch.harvard.edu,"Dong, Junchao/G-5719-2016","Dong, Junchao/0000-0001-7404-3562; Meyers, Robin/0000-0002-1802-7231","National Institute of Health [AI077595, CA133781, AI112602, AI037526, AI072529]; NIH [T32HL066987]; Robertson Foundation/Cancer Research Institute Irvington Fellowship","We thank K.

Certain methanotrophs are also able to switch to using the iron-containing soluble methane monooxygenase to catalyse methane oxidation, with this switchover regulated by copper(3,4). Methane monooxygenases are nature's primary biological mechanism for suppressing atmospheric levels of methane, a potent greenhouse gas. Furthermore, methanotrophs and methane monooxygenases have enormous potential in bioremediation and for biotransformations producing bulk and fine chemicals, and in bioenergy, particularly considering increased methane availability from renewable sources and hydraulic fracturing of shale rock(5,6). Here we discover and characterize a novel copper storage protein (Csp1) from the methanotroph Methylosinus trichosporium OB3b that is exported from the cytosol, and stores copper for particulate methane monooxygenase. Csp1 is a tetramer of four-helix bundles with each monomer binding up to 13 Cu(I) ions in a previously unseen manner via mainly Cys residues that point into the core of the bundle. Csp1 is the first example of a protein that stores a metal within an established protein-folding motif. This work provides a detailed insight into how methanotrophs accumulate copper for the oxidation of methane. Understanding this process is essential if the wide-ranging biotechnological applications of methanotrophs are to be realized. Cytosolic homologues of Csp1 are present in diverse bacteria, thus challenging the dogma that such organisms do not use copper in this location.","[Vita, Nicolas; Platsaki, Semeli; Basle, Arnaud; Allen, Stephen J.; Waldron, Kevin J.; Dennison, Christopher] Newcastle Univ, Sch Med, Inst Cell & Mol Biosci, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE2 4HH, Tyne & Wear, England; [Paterson, Neil G.] Diamond Light Source, Didcot OX11 0DE, Oxon, England; [Crombie, Andrew T.; Murrell, J.

Crystal structures have provided insight into GPCR interactions with ligands and G proteins(1,2), but our understanding of the conformational dynamics of activation is incomplete. Metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) are dimeric class C GPCRs that modulate neuronal excitability, synaptic plasticity, and serve as drug targets for neurological disorders(3,4). A 'clamshell' ligand-binding domain (LBD), which contains the ligand-binding site, is coupled to the transmembrane domain via a cysteine-rich domain, and LBD closure seems to be the first step in activation(5,6). Crystal structures of isolated mGluR LBD dimers led to the suggestion that activation also involves a reorientation of the dimer interface from a 'relaxed' to an 'active' state(7,8), but the relationship between ligand binding, LBD closure and dimer interface rearrangement in activation remains unclear. Here we use single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer to probe the activation mechanism of full-length mammalian group II mGluRs. We show that the LBDs interconvert between three conformations: resting, activated and a short-lived intermediate state. Orthosteric agonists induce transitions between these conformational states, with efficacy determined by occupancy of the active conformation. Unlike mGluR2, mGluR3 displays basal dynamics, which are Ca2+-dependent and lead to basal protein activation. Our results support a general mechanism for the activation of mGluRs in which agonist binding induces closure of the LBDs, followed by dimer interface reorientation. Our experimental strategy should be widely applicable to study conformational dynamics in GPCRs and other membrane proteins.","[Vafabakhsh, Reza; Levitz, Joshua; Isacoff, Ehud Y.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mol & Cell Biol, 229 Stanley Hall, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Isacoff, Ehud Y.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Helen Wills Neurosci Inst, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Isacoff, Ehud Y.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Phys Biosci Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA","Isacoff, EY (reprint author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mol & Cell Biol, 229 Stanley Hall, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",ehud@berkeley.edu,,,National Institutes of Health Nanomedicine Development Center for the Optical Control of Biological Function [2PN2EY018241]; National Science Foundation (EAGER) [IOS-1451027],"We thank Z.

Both organelles have conserved their prokaryotic biochemistry, but their genomes are reduced, and most organelle proteins are encoded in the nucleus. Endosymbiotic theory posits that bacterial genes in eukaryotic genomes entered the eukaryotic lineage via organelle ancestors. It predicts episodic influx of prokaryotic genes into the eukaryotic lineage, with acquisition corresponding to endosymbiotic events. Eukaryotic genome sequences, however, increasingly implicate lateral gene transfer, both from prokaryotes to eukaryotes and among eukaryotes, as a source of gene content variation in eukaryotic genomes, which predicts continuous, lineage-specific acquisition of prokaryotic genes in divergent eukaryotic groups. Here we discriminate between these two alternatives by clustering and phylogenetic analysis of eukaryotic gene families having prokaryotic homologues. Our results indicate (1) that gene transfer from bacteria to eukaryotes is episodic, as revealed by gene distributions, and coincides with major evolutionary transitions at the origin of chloroplasts and mitochondria; (2) that gene inheritance in eukaryotes is vertical, as revealed by extensive topological comparison, sparse gene distributions stemming from differential loss; and (3) that continuous, lineage-specific lateral gene transfer, although it sometimes occurs, does not contribute to long-term gene content evolution in eukaryotic genomes.","[Ku, Chuan; Nelson-Sathi, Shijulal; Roettger, Mayo; Sousa, Filipa L.; Martin, William F.] Univ Dusseldorf, Inst Mol Evolut, D-40225 Dusseldorf, Germany; [Lockhart, Peter J.] Massey Univ, Inst Fundamental Sci, Palmerston North 4474, New Zealand; [Bryant, David] Univ Otago, Dept Math & Stat, Dunedin 9054, New Zealand; [Hazkani-Covo, Einat] Open Univ Israel, Dept Nat & Life Sci, IL-43107 Raanana, Israel; [McInerney, James O.] Natl Univ Ireland, Dept Biol, Maynooth, Kildare, Ireland; [McInerney, James O.] Univ Manchester, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England; [Landan, Giddy] Univ Kiel, Inst Microbiol, Genom Microbiol Grp, D-24118 Kiel, Germany; [Martin, William F.] Univ Nova Lisboa, Inst Tecnol Quim & Biol, P-2780157 Oeiras, Portugal","Martin, WF (reprint author), Univ Dusseldorf, Inst Mol Evolut, D-40225 Dusseldorf, Germany.",bill@hhu.de,"Martin, William /O-5446-2015; Ku, Chuan/N-3093-2013; Sousa, Filipa/H-6192-2012","Martin, William /0000-0003-1478-6449; Ku, Chuan/0000-0001-6414-4423; Sousa, Filipa/0000-0002-4075-1701; Landan, Giddy/0000-0002-2502-8750; Nelson-Sathi, Shijulal/0000-0002-3346-0383","European Research Council [232975, 666053, 281357]; Templeton Foundation [48177]; Open University of Israel Research Fund; German-Israeli Foundation [I-1321-203.13/2015]; New Zealand BioProtection CoRE; German Academic Exchange Service [57076385]; Alexander von Humboldt Foundation","We thank the following funding agencies: the European Research Council grants 232975, 666053(W.F.M.) and 281357(G.L.; to T.

A prominent example of a flipping reaction is the translocation of lipid-linked oligosaccharides that serve as donors in N-linked protein glycosylation. In Campylobacter jejuni, this process is catalysed by the ABC transporter PglK. Here we present a mechanism of PglK-catalysed lipid-linked oligosaccharide flipping based on crystal structures in distinct states, a newly devised in vitro flipping assay, and in vivo studies. PglK can adopt inward-and outward-facing conformations in vitro, but only outward-facing states are required for flipping. While the pyrophosphate-oligosaccharide head group of lipid-linked oligosaccharides enters the translocation cavity and interacts with positively charged side chains, the lipidic polyprenyl tail binds and activates the transporter but remains exposed to the lipid bilayer during the reaction. The proposed mechanism is distinct from the classical alternating-access model applied to other transporters.","[Perez, Camilo; Gerber, Sabina; Bucher, Monika; Locher, Kaspar P.] ETH, Inst Mol Biol & Biophys, CH-8093 Zurich, Switzerland; [Boilevin, Jeremy; Darbre, Tamis; Reymond, Jean-Louis] Univ Bern, Dept Chem & Biochem, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland; [Aebi, Markus] ETH, Inst Microbiol, CH-8093 Zurich, Switzerland","Locher, KP (reprint author), ETH, Inst Mol Biol & Biophys, CH-8093 Zurich, Switzerland.",locher@mol.biol.ethz.ch,"Perez, Camilo/N-9542-2016","Perez, Camilo/0000-0002-5800-0084",Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF) [31003A-146191]; ETH,"We thank the staff scientists at the PX beamline of the Swiss Light Source for help with data collection, and M.

Planetary eccentricities and mutual inclinations can be large(3,4), perhaps forced gravitationally by the binary companion(4-6). Earlier work on single planet systems(5,7-10) appealed to the Kozai-Lidov instability(11,12) wherein a sufficiently inclined binary orbit excites large-amplitude oscillations in the planet's eccentricity and inclination. The instability, however, can be quenched by many agents that induce fast orbital precession, including mutual gravitational forces in a multiplanet system(5,13). Here we report that orbital precession, which inhibits Kozai-Lidov cycling in a multiplanet system, can become fast enough to resonate with the orbital motion of a distant binary companion. Resonant binary forcing results in dramatic outcomes ranging from the excitation of large planetary eccentricities and mutual inclinations to total disruption. Processes such as planetary migration(14,15) can bring an initially non-resonant system into resonance. As it does not require special physical or initial conditions, binary resonant driving is generic and may have altered the architecture of many multiplanet systems. It can also weaken the multiplanet occurrence rate in wide binaries, and affect planet formation in close binaries.","[Touma, Jihad R.] Amer Univ Beirut, Dept Phys, Beirut 11072020, Lebanon; [Sridhar, S.] Raman Res Inst, Bangalore 560080, Karnataka, India","Touma, JR (reprint author), Amer Univ Beirut, Dept Phys, POB 11-0236, Beirut 11072020, Lebanon.",jihad.touma@aub.edu.lb,"Sridhar, S/D-4895-2012",,,,,29,5,5,1,9,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,27-Aug,2015,524,7566,,,,,439,441,,10.1038/nature14873,,3,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,CP7LN,WOS:000360069300031,26310763,No,,,11/19/17

New accelerator concepts must be developed to achieve higher energies and to make future particle colliders more compact and affordable. The plasma wakefield accelerator (PWFA) embodies one such concept, in which the electric field of a plasma wake excited by a bunch of charged particles (such as electrons) is used to accelerate a trailing bunch of particles. To apply plasma acceleration to electron-positron colliders, it is imperative that both the electrons and their antimatter counterpart, the positrons, are efficiently accelerated at high fields using plasmas(1). Although substantial progress has recently been reported on high-field, high-efficiency acceleration of electrons in a PWFA powered by an electron bunch(2), such an electron-driven wake is unsuitable for the acceleration and focusing of a positron bunch. Here we demonstrate a new regime of PWFAs where particles in the front of a single positron bunch transfer their energy to a substantial number of those in the rear of the same bunch by exciting a wakefield in the plasma. In the process, the accelerating field is altered-'self-loaded'-so that about a billion positrons gain five gigaelectronvolts of energy with a narrow energy spread over a distance of just 1.3 metres. They extract about 30 per cent of the wake's energy and form a spectrally distinct bunch with a root-mean-square energy spread as low as 1.8 per cent. This ability to transfer energy efficiently from the front to the rear within a single positron bunch makes the PWFA scheme very attractive as an energy booster to an electron-positron collider.","[Corde, S.; Adli, E.; Allen, J.

Recently, free-electron lasers based on self-amplified spontaneous emission(3,4) have made it possible to generate a hard-X-ray laser (that is, the photon energy is of the order of ten kiloelectronvolts) in anngstrom-wavelength regime(5,6), enabling advances in fields from ultrafast X-ray spectrosopy to X-ray quantum optics. An atomic laser based on neon atoms and pumped by a soft-X-ray (that is, a photon energy of less than one kiloelectronvolt) free-electron laser has been achieved at a wavelength of 14 nanometres7. Here, we use a copper target and report a hard-X-ray inner-shell atomic laser operating at a wavelength of 1.5 angstroms. X-ray free-electron laser pulses with an intensity of about 10(19) watts per square centimetre(7,8) tuned to the copper K-absorption edge produced sufficient population inversion to generate strong amplified spontaneous emission on the copper Ka lines.

It has had a revolutionary impact in altering or introducing electronic(1,2), magnetic(3,4), luminescent(5,6), and catalytic(7) properties for several applications, for example in semiconductors. Here we explore and demonstrate the extension of the concept of substitutional atomic doping to nanometre-scale crystal doping, in which one nanocrystal is used to replace another to form doped self-assembled superlattices. Towards this goal, we show that gold nanocrystals act as substitutional dopants in superlattices of cadmium selenide or lead selenide nanocrystals when the size of the gold nanocrystal is very close to that of the host. The gold nanocrystals occupy random positions in the superlattice and their density is readily and widely controllable, analogous to the case of atomic doping, but here through nanocrystal self-assembly. We also show that the electronic properties of the superlattices are highly tunable and strongly affected by the presence and density of the gold nanocrystal dopants. The conductivity of lead selenide films, for example, can be manipulated over at least six orders of magnitude by the addition of gold nanocrystals and is explained by a percolation model. As this process relies on the self-assembly of uniform nanocrystals, it can be generally applied to assemble a wide variety of nanocrystal-doped structures for electronic, optical, magnetic, and catalytic materials.","[Cargnello, Matteo; Diroll, Benjamin T.; Kagan, Cherie R.; Murray, Christopher B.] Univ Penn, Dept Chem, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Johnston-Peck, Aaron C.; Herzing, Andrew A.] NIST, Mat Measurement Lab, Gaithersburg, MD 20899 USA; [Wong, Eric] Univ Penn, Dept Phys, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Datta, Bianca; Damodhar, Divij; Doan-Nguyen, Vicky V.

In cases where a single metal fails to promote a selective or efficient transformation, the synergistic cooperation(4) of two distinct catalysts-multimetallic catalysis-can be used instead. Many important reactions rely on multimetallic catalysis(5-10), such as the Wacker oxidation of olefins(6-8) and the Sonogashira coupling of alkynes with aryl halides(9,10), but this approach has largely been limited to the use of metals with distinct reactivities, with only one metal catalyst undergoing oxidative addition(11,12). Here, we demonstrate that cooperativity between two group 10 metal catalysts-(bipyridine)nickel and (1,3-bis(diphenylphosphino) propane) palladiumenables a general cross-Ullmann reaction (the cross-coupling of two different aryl electrophiles)(13-15). Our method couples aryl bromides with aryl triflates directly, eliminating the use of arylmetal reagents and avoiding the challenge of differentiating between multiple carbon-hydrogen bonds that is required for direct arylation methods(16,17). Selectivity can be achieved without an excess of either substrate and originates from the orthogonal reactivity of the two catalysts and the relative stability of the two arylmetal intermediates. While (1,3-bis(diphenylphosphino) propane) palladium reacts preferentially with aryl triflates to afford a persistent intermediate, (bipyridine) nickel reacts preferentially with aryl bromides to form a transient, reactive intermediate. Although each catalyst forms less than 5 per cent cross-coupled product in isolation, together they are able to achieve a yield of up to 94 per cent. Our results reveal a new method for the synthesis of biaryls, heteroaryls, and dienes, as well as a general mechanism for the selective transfer of ligands between two metal catalysts. We anticipate that this reaction will simplify the synthesis of pharmaceuticals, many of which are currently made with pre-formed organometallic reagents(1-3), and lead to the discovery of new multimetallic reactions.","[Ackerman, Laura K.

Seismicity in the western United States away from the plate boundary is clustered along a meandering, north-south trending 'intermountain' belt(1). This zone coincides with a transition from thin, actively deforming to thicker, less tectonically active crust and lithosphere. Although such structural gradients have been invoked to explain seismicity localization(2,3), the underlying cause of seismicity remains unclear. Here we show results fromimproved mantle flowmodels that reveal a relationship between seismicity and the rate change of 'dynamic topography' (that is, vertical normal stress from mantle flow). The associated predictive skill is greater than that of any of the other forcings we examined. Wesuggest that active mantle flow is amajor contributor to seismogenic intraplate deformation, while gravitational potential energy variations have a minor role. Seismicity localization should occur where convective changes in vertical normal stress are modulated by lithospheric strength heterogeneities. Our results on deformation processes appear consistent with findings from other mobile belts(4), and imply that mantle flow plays a significant and quantifiable part in shaping topography, tectonics, and seismic hazard within intraplate settings.","[Becker, Thorsten W.] Univ So Calif, Dept Earth Sci, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA; [Lowry, Anthony R.] Utah State Univ, Dept Geol, Logan, UT 84322 USA; [Faccenna, Claudio] Univ Roma Tre, Dept Sci, I-00146 Rome, Italy; [Schmandt, Brandon] Univ New Mexico, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, Albuquerque, NM 87131 USA; [Borsa, Adrian] Univ Calif San Diego, Scripps Inst Oceanog, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Yu, Chunquan] MIT, Dept Earth Atmospher & Planetary Sci, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA","Becker, TW (reprint author), Univ So Calif, Dept Earth Sci, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA.",twb@usc.edu,"Lowry, Anthony/F-8158-2012","Lowry, Anthony/0000-0001-6023-3090; /0000-0001-8681-8572","National Science Foundation (NSF) [EAR-0350028, EAR-0732947]; NSF/US Geological Survey Southern California Earthquake Center;  [EAR-1215720];  [EAR-1215757];  [EAR-0955909];  [EAR-1358622]","We thank C.

These embryonic tissues contribute to the development of the cranium and associated sensory organs, which were crucial for the evolution of the vertebrate ""new head""(2,3). Aprevious study suggests that rudimentary neural crest cells existed in ancestral chordates(4). However, the evolutionary origins of neurogenic placodes have remained obscure owing to a paucity of embryonic data from tunicates, the closest living relatives to those early vertebrates(5). Here we show that the tunicate Ciona intestinalis exhibits a proto-placodal ectoderm (PPE) that requires inhibition of bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) and expresses the key regulatory determinant Six1/ 2 and its co-factor Eya, a developmental process conserved across vertebrates. The Ciona PPE is shown to produce ciliated neurons that express genes for gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH), a G-protein-coupled receptor for relaxin-3 (RXFP3) and a functional cyclic nucleotide-gated channel (CNGA), which suggests dual chemosensory and neurosecretory activities. These observations provide evidence that Ciona has a neurogenic proto-placode, which forms neurons that appear to be related to those derived from the olfactory placode and hypothalamic neurons of vertebrates. We discuss the possibility that the PPE-derived GnRH neurons of Ciona resemble an ancestral cell type, a progenitor to the complex neuronal circuit that integrates sensory information and neuroendocrine functions in vertebrates.","[Abitua, Philip Barron; Gainous, T.

Each RGC type extracts salient features from visual input, which are sent deeper into the brain for further processing(1-4). The specificity and stereotypy of synapses formed in the inner plexiform layer account for the feature-detecting ability of RGCs. Here we analyse the development and function of synapses on one mouse RGC type, called the W3B-RGC(5,6). These cells have the remarkable property of responding when the timing of the movement of a small object differs from that of the background, but not when they coincide(6). Such cells, known as local edge detectors or object motion sensors, can distinguish moving objects from a visual scene that is also moving(6-12). We show that W3B-RGCs receive strong and selective input from an unusual excitatory amacrine cell type known as VG3-AC (vesicular glutamate transporter 3). Both W3B-RGCs and VG3-ACs express the immunoglobulin superfamily recognition molecule sidekick 2 (Sdk2)(13,14), and both loss-and gain-of-function studies indicate that Sdk2-dependent homophilic interactions are necessary for the selectivity of the connection. The Sdk2-specified synapse is essential for visual responses of W3B-RGCs: whereas bipolar cells relay visual input directly to most RGCs, the W3B-RGCs receive much of their input indirectly, via the VG3-ACs. This non-canonical circuit introduces a delay into the pathway from photoreceptors in the centre of the receptive field to W3B-RGCs, which could improve their ability to judge the synchrony of local and global motion.","[Krishnaswamy, Arjun; Yamagata, Masahito; Duan, Xin; Hong, Y.

Only the JFH-1 isolate has the capacity to replicate efficiently in cultured hepatoma cells without cell culture-adaptive mutations(1-3). We hypothesized that cultured cells lack one or more factors required for the replication of clinical isolates. To identify the missing factors, we transduced Huh-7.5 human hepatoma cells with a pooled lentivirus-based human complementary DNA (cDNA) library, transfected the cells with HCV subgenomic replicons lacking adaptive mutations, and selected for stable replicon colonies. This led to the identification of a single cDNA, SEC14L2, that enabled RNA replication of diverse HCV genotypes in several hepatoma cell lines. This effect was dose-dependent, and required the continuous presence of SEC14L2. Full-length HCV genomes also replicated and produced low levels of infectious virus. Remarkably, SEC14L2-expressing Huh-7.5 cells also supported HCV replication following inoculation with patient sera. Mechanistic studies suggest that SEC14L2 promotes HCV infection by enhancing vitamin E-mediated protection against lipid peroxidation. This provides a foundation for development of in vitro replication systems for all HCV isolates, creating a useful platform to dissect the mechanisms by which cell culture-adaptive mutations act.","[Saeed, Mohsan; Andreo, Ursula; Chung, Hyo-Young; Espiritu, Christine; Rice, Charles M.] Rockefeller Univ, Lab Virol & Infect Dis, Ctr Study Hepatitis C, New York, NY 10065 USA; [Branch, Andrea D.] Icahn Sch Med Mt Sinai, Div Liver Dis, New York, NY 10029 USA; [Silva, Jose M.] Icahn Sch Med Mt Sinai, Dept Pathol, New York, NY 10029 USA","Rice, CM (reprint author), Rockefeller Univ, Lab Virol & Infect Dis, Ctr Study Hepatitis C, New York, NY 10065 USA.",ricec@mail.rockefeller.edu,,,"National Institutes of Health, NCI [R01CA057973]; NIAID [R01AI072613, R01AI099284]; NIDDK [R01DK090317]; NIDA [DA031095]; Helmsley Postdoctoral Fellowship for Basic and Translational Research on Disorders of the Digestive System at The Rockefeller University; American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases; Greenberg Medical Research Institute; Starr Foundation; Ronald A.

There is no clear evidence that intercalation is involved in pathologies. Here we use the proto-oncogene myc to study a process analogous to early phase of tumour expansion: myc-induced cell competition(2-7). Cell competition is a conserved mechanism(5,6,8,9) driving the elimination of slow-proliferating cells (so-called 'losers') by faster-proliferating neighbours (so-called 'winners') through apoptosis(10) and is important in preventing developmental malformations and maintain tissue fitness(11). Here we show, using long-term live imaging of myc-driven competition in the Drosophila pupal notum and in the wing imaginal disc, that the probability of elimination of loser cells correlates with the surface of contact shared with winners. As such, modifying loser-winner interface morphology can modulate the strength of competition. We further show that elimination of loser clones requires winner-loser cell mixing through cell-cell intercalation. Cell mixing is driven by differential growth and the high tension at winner-winner interfaces relative to winner-loser and loser-loser interfaces, which leads to a preferential stabilization of winner-loser contacts and reduction of clone compactness over time. Differences in tension are generated by a relative difference in F-actin levels between loser and winner junctions, induced by differential levels of the membrane lipid phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate. Our results establish the first link between cell-cell intercalation induced by a proto-oncogene and how it promotes invasiveness and destruction of healthy tissues.","[Levayer, Romain; Hauert, Barbara; Moreno, Eduardo] Univ Bern, Inst Cell Biol, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland","Moreno, E (reprint author), Univ Bern, Inst Cell Biol, Baltzerstr 4, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland.",eduardo.moreno@izb.unibe.ch,,"Levayer, Romain/0000-0001-6769-1465",EMBO [ALTF 366-2012]; Human Frontier post-doctoral fellowship [LT000178/2013]; European Research Council; Swiss National Science Foundation; Josef Steiner Cancer Research Foundation; Swiss Cancer League,"We thank members of the Moreno laboratory for reading this manuscript.

The multifunctionality poses a great challenge for understanding the mechanisms by which mitochondrial dysfunction causes specific pathologies. Among the leading mitochondrial mediators of cell death are energy depletion, free radical production, defects in iron-sulfur cluster biosynthesis, the release of pro-apoptotic and non-cell-autonomous signalling molecules, and altered stress signalling(1-5). Here we identify a new pathway of mitochondria-mediated cell death in yeast. This pathway was named mitochondrial precursor over-accumulation stress (mPOS), and is characterized by aberrant accumulation of mitochondrial precursors in the cytosol. mPOS can be triggered by clinically relevant mitochondrial damage that is not limited to the core machineries of protein import. We also discover a large network of genes that suppress mPOS, by modulating ribosomal biogenesis, messenger RNA decapping, transcript-specific translation, protein chaperoning and turnover. In response to mPOS, several ribosome-associated proteins were upregulated, including Gis2 and Nog2, which promote cap-independent translation and inhibit the nuclear export of the 60S ribosomal subunit, respectively(6,7). Gis2 and Nog2 upregulation promotes cell survival, which may be part of a feedback loop that attenuates mPOS. Our data indicate that mitochondrial dysfunction contributes directly to cytosolic proteostatic stress, and provide an explanation for the association between these two hallmarks of degenerative diseases and ageing. The results are relevant to understanding diseases (for example, spinocerebellar ataxia, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and myotonic dystrophy) that involve mutations within the anti-degenerative network.","[Wang, Xiaowen; Chen, Xin Jie] SUNY Upstate Med Univ, Dept Biochem & Mol Biol, Syracuse, NY 13210 USA","Chen, XJ (reprint author), SUNY Upstate Med Univ, Dept Biochem & Mol Biol, Syracuse, NY 13210 USA.",chenx@upstate.edu,,,"National Institutes of Health (NIH) [R01AG023731, R21AG047400]","We thank M.

Complex machineries which maintain the specificity of protein import and sorting include the TIM23 translocase responsible for the transfer of precursor proteins into the matrix, and the mitochondrial intermembrane space import and assembly (MIA) machinery required for the biogenesis of intermembrane space proteins. Dysfunction of mitochondrial protein sorting pathways results in diminishing specific substrate proteins, followed by systemic pathology of the organelle and organismal death(1-4). The cellular responses caused by accumulation of mitochondrial precursor proteins in the cytosol are mainly unknown. Here we present a comprehensive picture of the changes in the cellular transcriptome and proteome in response to a mitochondrial import defect and precursor over-accumulation stress. Pathways were identified that protect the cell against mitochondrial biogenesis defects by inhibiting protein synthesis and by activation of the proteasome, a major machine for cellular protein clearance. Proteasomal activity is modulated in proportion to the quantity of mislocalized mitochondrial precursor proteins in the cytosol. We propose that this type of unfolded protein response activated by mistargeting of proteins (UPRam) is beneficial for the cells. UPRam provides a means for buffering the consequences of physiological slowdown in mitochondrial protein import and for counteracting pathologies that are caused or contributed by mitochondrial dysfunction.","[Wrobel, Lidia; Topf, Ulrike; Bragoszewski, Piotr; Sztolsztener, Malgorzata E.; Varabyova, Aksana; Chroscicki, Piotr; Januszewicz, Elzbieta; Chacinska, Agnieszka] Int Inst Mol & Cell Biol, PL-02109 Warsaw, Poland; [Wiese, Sebastian; Oeljeklaus, Silke; Warscheid, Bettina] Univ Freiburg, Dept Biochem & Funct Prote, Fac Biol, D-79104 Freiburg, Germany; [Wiese, Sebastian; Oeljeklaus, Silke; Warscheid, Bettina] Univ Freiburg, BIOSS Ctr Biol Signalling Studies, D-79104 Freiburg, Germany; [Wiese, Sebastian; Warscheid, Bettina] Univ Freiburg, ZBSA Ctr Biol Syst Anal, D-79104 Freiburg, Germany; [Lirski, Maciej; Mroczek, Seweryn; Dziembowski, Andrzej; Koblowska, Marta] Polish Acad Sci, Inst Biochem & Biophys, PL-02106 Warsaw, Poland; [Mroczek, Seweryn; Dziembowski, Andrzej] Univ Warsaw, Fac Biol, Dept Genet & Biotechnol, PL-02106 Warsaw, Poland; [Koblowska, Marta] Univ Warsaw, Fac Biol, Lab Syst Biol, PL-02106 Warsaw, Poland","Chacinska, A (reprint author), Int Inst Mol & Cell Biol, PL-02109 Warsaw, Poland.",bettina.warscheid@biologie.uni-freiburg.de; achacinska@iimcb.gov.pl,,"Dziembowski, Andrzej/0000-0001-8492-7572","PRIDE Team, EBI; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft; Excellence Initiative of the German Federal Government [EXC 294 BIOSS]; Excellence Initiative of the German State Government [EXC 294 BIOSS]; Foundation for Polish Science - Welcome Programme - EU within the European Regional Development Fund; National Science Centre [2011/02/B/NZ2/01402, 2013/11/B/NZ3/00974, 2013/08/T/NZ1/00770, 2013/11/D/NZ1/02294]; Ministerial Ideas Plus schema [000263]; Swiss National Science Foundation [PP300P3-147899]","We thank A.

This coordination is achieved by the recruitment of an actomyosin regulator, Ect2, to overlapping microtubules at the centre of the elongating anaphase spindle(1). Ect2 then signals to the overlying cortex to promote the assembly and constriction of an actomyosin ring between segregating chromosomes(1). Here, by studying division in proliferating Drosophila and human cells, we demonstrate the existence of a second, parallel signalling pathway, which triggers the relaxation of the polar cell cortex at mid anaphase. This is independent of furrow formation, centrosomes and microtubules and, instead, depends on PP1 phosphatase and its regulatory subunit Sds22 (refs 2, 3). As separating chromosomes move towards the polar cortex at mid anaphase, kinetochore-localized PP1-Sds22 helps to break cortical symmetry by inducing the dephosphorylation and inactivation of ezrin/radixin/moesin proteins at cell poles. This promotes local softening of the cortex(2,3), facilitating anaphase elongation and orderly cell division. In summary, this identifies a conserved kinetochore-based phosphatase signal and substrate, which function together to link anaphase chromosome movements to cortical polarization, thereby coupling chromosome segregation to cell division.","[Rodrigues, Nelio T.

Release factors recognize stop codons in the ribosomal A-site to mediate release of the nascent chain and recycling of the ribosome. Bacteria decode stop codons using two separate release factors with differing specificities for the second and third bases(1). By contrast, eukaryotes rely on an evolutionarily unrelated omnipotent release factor (eRF1) to recognize all three stop codons(2). The molecular basis of eRF1 discrimination for stop codons over sense codons is not known. Here we present cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures at 3.5-3.8 angstrom resolution of mammalian ribosomal complexes containing eRF1 interacting with each of the three stop codons in the A-site. Binding of eRF1 flips nucleotide A1825 of 18S ribosomal RNA so that it stacks on the second and third stop codon bases. This configuration pulls the fourth position base into the A-site, where it is stabilized by stacking against G626 of 18S rRNA. Thus, eRF1 exploits two rRNA nucleotides also used during transfer RNA selection to drive messenger RNA compaction. In this compacted mRNA conformation, stop codons are favoured by a hydrogen-bonding network formed between rRNA and essential eRF1 residues that constrains the identity of the bases. These results provide a molecular framework for eukaryotic stop codon recognition and have implications for future studies on the mechanisms of canonical and premature translation termination(3,4).","[Brown, Alan; Shao, Sichen; Murray, Jason; Hegde, Ramanujan S.; Ramakrishnan, V.] MRC Lab Mol Biol, Cambridge CB2 0QH, England","Hegde, RS (reprint author), MRC Lab Mol Biol, Francis Crick Ave, Cambridge CB2 0QH, England.",rhegde@mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk; ramak@mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk,,"Ramakrishnan, V/0000-0002-4699-2194; Brown, Alan/0000-0002-0021-0476; Hegde, Ramanujan/0000-0001-8338-852X; Shao, Sichen/0000-0003-2679-5537","UK Medical Research Council [MC_UP_A022_1007, MC_U105184332]; Career Development Fellowship; St John's College Title A fellowship; Wellcome Trust [WT096570]; Agouron Institute; Jeantet Foundation; NIH Oxford-Cambridge Scholars' Program","We thank C.

To initiate mitophagy, the ubiquitin kinase PINK1 phosphorylates ubiquitin to activate the ubiquitin ligase parkin, which builds ubiquitin chains on mitochondrial outer membrane proteins, where they act to recruit autophagy receptors. Using genome editing to knockout five autophagy receptors in HeLa cells, here we show that two receptors previously linked to xenophagy, NDP52 and optineurin, are the primary receptors for PINK1- and parkin-mediated mitophagy. PINK1 recruits NDP52 and optineurin, but not p62, to mitochondria to activate mitophagy directly, independently of parkin. Once recruited to mitochondria, NDP52 and optineurin recruit the autophagy factors ULK1, DFCP1 and WIPI1 to focal spots proximal to mitochondria, revealing a function for these autophagy receptors upstream of LC3. This supports a new model in which PINK1-generated phospho-ubiquitin serves as the autophagy signal on mitochondria, and parkin then acts to amplify this signal. This work also suggests direct and broader roles for ubiquitin phosphorylation in other autophagy pathways.","[Lazarou, Michael; Sliter, Danielle A.; Kane, Lesley A.; Sarraf, Shireen A.; Wang, Chunxin; Burman, Jonathon L.; Sideris, Dionisia P.; Fogel, Adam I.; Youle, Richard J.] NINDS, Biochem Sect, Surg Neurol Branch, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA","Youle, RJ (reprint author), NINDS, Biochem Sect, Surg Neurol Branch, NIH, Bldg 36,Rm 4D04, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA.",youler@ninds.nih.gov,"Wang, Chunxin/B-9312-2016","Wang, Chunxin/0000-0001-6015-6806; Lazarou, Michael/0000-0003-2150-5545","NIH, NINDS; National Health and Medical Research Council [GNT1063781]","We thank C.

The BU72-stabilized changes in the mu OR binding pocket are subtle and differ from those observed for agonist-bound structures of the beta(2)-adrenergic receptor (beta(2)AR) and the M2 muscarinic receptor. Comparison with active beta(2)AR reveals a common rearrangement in the packing of three conserved amino acids in the core of the mu OR, and molecular dynamics simulations illustrate how the ligand-binding pocket is conformationally linked to this conserved triad.

Getting the cores to form before the solar nebula dissipates (in about one to ten million years; ref. 3) has been a major challenge for planet formation models(4,5). Recently models have emerged in which 'pebbles' (centimetre-to-metre-sized objects) are first concentrated by aerodynamic drag and then gravitationally collapse to form objects 100 to 1,000 kilometres in size(6-9). These 'planetesimals' can then efficiently accrete left-over pebbles(10) and directly form the cores of giant planets(11,12). This model is known as 'pebble accretion'; theoretically, it can produce cores of ten Earth masses in only a few thousand years(11,13). Unfortunately, full simulations of this process(13) show that, rather than creating a few such cores, it produces a population of hundreds of Earth-mass objects that are inconsistent with the structure of the Solar System. Here we report that this difficulty can be overcome if pebbles form slowly enough to allow the planetesimals to gravitationally interact with one another. In this situation, the largest planetesimals have time to scatter their smaller siblings out of the disk of pebbles, thereby stifling their growth. Our models show that, for a large and physically reasonable region of parameter space, this typically leads to the formation of one to four gas giants between 5 and 15 astronomical units from the Sun, in agreement with the observed structure of the Solar System.","[Levison, Harold F.; Kretke, Katherine A.] SW Res Inst, Boulder, CO 80302 USA; [Levison, Harold F.; Kretke, Katherine A.] NASA Solar Syst Explorat Res Virtual Inst, Boulder, CO 80302 USA; [Duncan, Martin J.] Queens Univ, Dept Phys Engn Phys & Astron, Kingston, ON K7L 3N6, Canada","Levison, HF (reprint author), SW Res Inst, 1050 Walnut St,Suite 300, Boulder, CO 80302 USA.",hal@boulder.swri.edu,,,NSF,"This work was supported by an NSF Astronomy and Astrophysics Research Grant (principal investigator H.F.L.).

Recent years have seen successful applications of these protocols in a variety of well-isolated micro-systems, including microwave photons(3) and superconducting qubits(4). However, stabilizing the quantum state of a tangibly massive object, such as a mechanical oscillator, remains very challenging: the main obstacle is environmental decoherence, which places stringent requirements on the timescale in which the state must be measured. Here we describe a position sensor that is capable of resolving the zero-point motion of a solid-state, 4.3-megahertz nanomechanical oscillator in the timescale of its thermal decoherence, a basic requirement for real-time (Markovian) quantum feedback control tasks, such as ground-state preparation. The sensor is based on evanescent optomechanical coupling to a high-Q microcavity(5), and achieves an imprecision four orders of magnitude below that at the standard quantum limit for a weak continuous position measurement(6)-a 100-fold improvement over previous reports(7-9)-while maintaining an imprecision-back-action product that is within a factor of five of the Heisenberg uncertainty limit. As a demonstration of its utility, we use the measurement as an error signal with which to feedback cool the oscillator. Using radiation pressure as an actuator, the oscillator is cold damped(10) with high efficiency: from a cryogenic-bath temperature of 4.4 kelvin to an effective value of 1.1 +/- 0.1 millikelvin, corresponding to a mean phonon number of 5.3 +/- 0.6 (that is, a ground-state probability of 16 per cent). Our results set a new benchmark for the performance of a linear position sensor, and signal the emergence of mechanical oscillators as practical subjects for measurement-based quantum control.","[Wilson, D.

Recently, nickel catalysis has been shown to participate in a wide variety of C-C bond-forming reactions, most notably Negishi, Suzuki-Miyaura, Stille, Kumada and Hiyama couplings(1,2). Despite the tremendous advances in C-C fragment couplings, the ability to forge C-O bonds in a general fashion via nickel catalysis has been largely unsuccessful. The challenge for nickel-mediated alcohol couplings has been the mechanistic requirement for the critical C-O bond-forming step (formally known as the reductive elimination step) to occur via a Ni(III) alkoxide intermediate. Here we demonstrate that visible-light-excited photoredox catalysts can modulate the preferred oxidation states of nickel alkoxides in an operative catalytic cycle, thereby providing transient access to Ni(III) species that readily participate in reductive elimination. Using this synergistic merger of photoredox and nickel catalysis, we have developed a highly efficient and general carbon-oxygen coupling reaction using abundant alcohols and aryl bromides. More notably, we have developed a general strategy to 'switch on' important yet elusive organometallic mechanisms via oxidation state modulations using only weak light and single-electron-transfer catalysts.","[Terrett, Jack A.; Cuthbertson, James D.; Shurtleff, Valerie W.; MacMillan, David W.

Yet estimates of Chinese emissions remain subject to large uncertainty; inventories of China's total fossil fuel carbon emissions in 2008 differ by 0.3 gigatonnes of carbon, or 15 per cent(1,3-5). The primary sources of this uncertainty are conflicting estimates of energy consumption and emission factors, the latter being uncertain because of very few actual measurements representative of the mix of Chinese fuels. Here we re-evaluate China's carbon emissions using updated and harmonized energy consumption and clinker production data and two new and comprehensive sets of measured emission factors for Chinese coal. We find that total energy consumption in China was 10 per cent higher in 2000-2012 than the value reported by China's national statistics(6), that emission factors for Chinese coal are on average 40 per cent lower than the default values recommended by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change(7), and that emissions from China's cement production are 45 per cent less than recent estimates(1,4). Altogether, our revised estimate of China's CO2 emissions from fossil fuel combustion and cement production is 2.49 gigatonnes of carbon (2 standard deviations = +/-7.3 per cent) in 2013, which is 14 per cent lower than the emissions reported by other prominent inventories(1,4,8). Over the full period 2000 to 2013, our revised estimates are 2.9 gigatonnes of carbon less than previous estimates of China's cumulative carbon emissions(1,4). Our findings suggest that overestimation of China's emissions in 2000-2013 may be larger than China's estimated total forest sink in 1990-2007 (2.66 gigatonnes of carbon)(9) or China's land carbon sink in 2000-2009 (2.6 gigatonnes of carbon)(10).","[Liu, Zhu] Harvard Univ, John F Kennedy Sch Govt, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Guan, Dabo; Davis, Steven J.; Xi, Fengming] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Appl Ecol, Shenyang 110016, Peoples R China; [Liu, Zhu] CALTECH, Resnick Sustainabil Inst, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA; [Guan, Dabo; Zhang, Qiang; Zhao, Hongyan; Hong, Chaopeng] Tsinghua Univ, Ctr Earth Syst Sci, Key Lab Earth Syst Modeling, Minist Educ, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China; [Guan, Dabo; Li, Yuan] Univ E Anglia, Sch Int Dev, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England; [Wei, Wei] Chinese Acad Sci, Shanghai Adv Res Inst, CAS Key Lab Lowcarbon Convers Sci & Engn, Shanghai 201203, Peoples R China; [Davis, Steven J.] Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Earth Syst Sci, Irvine, CA 92697 USA; [Ciais, Philippe; Peng, Shushi] CE Orme Merisiers, CEA CNRS UVSQ, Lab Sci Climat & Environm, F-91191 Gif Sur Yvette, France; [Bai, Jin] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Coal Chem, State Key Lab Coal Convers, Taiyuan 030001, Peoples R China; [Peng, Shushi] CNRS, F-38041 Grenoble, France; [Peng, Shushi] UJF Grenoble 1, LGGE, UMR5183, F-38041 Grenoble, France; [Hubacek, Klaus; Feng, Kuishuang] Univ Maryland, Dept Geog Sci, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Marland, Gregg] Appalachian State Univ, Res Inst Environm Energy & Econ, Boone, NC 28608 USA; [Andres, Robert J.; Boden, Thomas A.] Oak Ridge Natl Lab, Carbon Dioxide Informat Anal Ctr, Oak Ridge, TN 37831 USA; [Crawford-Brown, Douglas] Univ Cambridge, Dept Land Econ, Cambridge Ctr Climate Change Mitigat Res, Cambridge CB3 9EP, England; [Lin, Jintai] Peking Univ, Sch Phys, Dept Atmospher & Ocean Sci, Lab Climate & Ocean Atmosphere Studies, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China; [Hong, Chaopeng; He, Kebin] Tsinghua Univ, Sch Environm, State Key Joint Lab Environm Simulat & Pollut C, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China; [Peters, Glen P.] CICERO, N-0318 Oslo, Norway; [Xi, Fengming] Chinese Acad Sci, CAS Key Lab Pollut Ecol & Environm Engn, Shenyang 110016, Peoples R China; [Liu, Junguo] Beijing Forestry Univ, Sch Nat Conservat, Beijing 10083, Peoples R China; [Liu, Junguo] Int Inst Appl Syst Anal, Ecosyst Serv & Management Program, A-2361 Laxenburg, Austria; [Liu, Junguo] South Univ Sci & Technol China, Sch Environm Sci & Engn, Shenzhen 518055, Peoples R China; [Zhao, Yu] Nanjing Univ, State Key Lab Pollut Control& Resource Reuse, Nanjing 210023, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Zhao, Yu] Nanjing Univ, Sch Environm, Nanjing 210023, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Zeng, Ning] Univ Maryland, Dept Atmospher & Ocean Sci, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Zeng, Ning] Univ Maryland, Earth Syst Sci Interdisciplinary Ctr, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Zeng, Ning] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Atmospher Phys, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China","Liu, Z (reprint author), Harvard Univ, John F Kennedy Sch Govt, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",liuzhu@iae.ac.cn; dabo.guan@uea.ac.uk; weiwei@sari.ac.cn; hekb@tsinghua.edu.cn,"; Zhang, Qiang/D-9034-2012; Lin, Jintai/A-8872-2012; Liu, Zhu/A-4634-2013; Peng, Shushi/J-4779-2014; Liu, Junguo/B-3021-2012; Zeng, Ning/A-3130-2008; Guan, Dabo/K-5534-2017","Bai, Jin/0000-0002-8623-1656; Lin, Jintai/0000-0002-2362-2940; Liu, Zhu/0000-0002-8968-7050; Peng, Shushi/0000-0001-5098-726X; Liu, Junguo/0000-0002-5745-6311; Zeng, Ning/0000-0002-7489-7629; Guan, Dabo/0000-0003-3773-3403; Davis, Steven/0000-0002-9338-0844; ANDRES, ROBERT/0000-0001-8781-4979","Chinese Academy of Sciences; China's National Basic Research Program; National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [XDA05010109, 2014CB441301, XDA05010110, XDA05010103, XDA05010101, 41328008, 41222036]; Italy's Ministry for Environment, Land and Sea; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/L016028]; Institute of Applied Ecology, Chinese Academy of Sciences; European Research Council [ERC-2013-SyG 610028-IMBALANCE-P]; US Department of Energy, Office of Science, Biological and Environmental Research under US Department of Energy [DE-AC05-00OR22725]; NSFC [41422502, 41175127, 41161140353, 91425303, 41473076]; International Science & Technology Cooperation Program of China [2012DFA91530]; Natural Science Foundation of Beijing, China [8151002]; National Program for Support of Top-notch Young Professionals; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [TD-JC-2013-2]; China CDM Fund [2013051, 2013124]; Shenyang Science and Technology Planning [F14-232-6-01, F14-134-9-00]; Norwegian Research Council [235523]","This work was supported by the Strategic Priority Research Program ""Climate Change: Carbon Budget and Relevant Issues"" of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and by China's National Basic Research Program and National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) funded projects (grants XDA05010109, 2014CB441301, XDA05010110, XDA05010103, XDA05010101, 41328008 and 41222036).

Such fluids are trapped within diamonds when they form(4-7) and so diamonds provide a unique means of directly characterizing the fluids that percolate through the deep continental lithospheric mantle. Here we show a clear chemical evolutionary trend, identifying saline fluids as parental to silicic and carbonatitic deep mantle melts, in diamonds from the Northwest Territories, Canada. Fluid-rock interaction along with in situ melting cause compositional transitions, as the saline fluids traverse mixed peridotite-eclogite lithosphere. Moreover, the chemistry of the parental saline fluids-especially their strontium isotopic compositions-and the timing of host diamond formation suggest that a subducting Mesozoic plate under western North America is the source of the fluids. Our results imply a strong association between subduction, mantle metasomatism and fluid-rich diamond formation, emphasizing the importance of subduction-derived fluids in affecting the composition of the deep lithospheric mantle.","[Weiss, Yaakov] Columbia Univ, Lamont Doherty Earth Observ, New York, NY 10964 USA; [McNeill, John; Nowell, Geoff M.; Ottley, Chris J.] Univ Durham, Dept Earth Sci, Durham DH1 3LE, England; [Pearson, D.

Among the oldest and most enigmatic of these macrofossils are the Rangeomorpha, a group characterized by modular, self-similar branching and a sessile benthic habit(2-4). Localized occurrences of large in situ fossilized rangeomorph populations allow fundamental aspects of their biology to be resolved using spatial point process techniques(5). Here we use such techniques to identify recurrent clustering patterns in the rangeomorph Fractofusus, revealing a complex life history of multigenerational, stolon-like asexual reproduction, interspersed with dispersal by waterborne propagules. Ecologically, such a habit would have allowed both for the rapid colonization of a localized area and for transport to new, previously uncolonized areas. The capacity of Fractofusus to derive adult morphology by two distinct reproductive modes documents the sophistication of its underlying developmental biology.","[Mitchell, Emily G.; Kenchington, Charlotte G.; Butterfield, Nicholas J.] Univ Cambridge, Dept Earth Sci, Cambridge CB2 3EQ, England; [Kenchington, Charlotte G.] British Geol Survey, Nottingham NG12 5GG, England; [Liu, Alexander G.] Univ Bristol, Sch Earth Sci, Bristol BS8 1TQ, Avon, England; [Matthews, Jack J.] Univ Oxford, Dept Earth Sci, Oxford OX1 3AN, England","Mitchell, EG (reprint author), Univ Cambridge, Dept Earth Sci, Downing St, Cambridge CB2 3EQ, England.",ek338@cam.ac.uk,,"Liu, Alexander/0000-0002-3985-982X; Butterfield, Nicholas/0000-0002-3046-7520","Natural Environment Research Council [NE/I005927/1, NE/J5000045/1, NE/L011409/1, NE/G523539/1]; Cambridge Philosophical Society","The Parks and Natural Areas Division, Department of Environment and Conservation, Government of Newfoundland and Labrador, provided permits to conduct research within the Mistaken Point Ecological Reserve in 2010, while the Department of Tourism, Culture and Recreation provided permits for palaeontological research on the Bonavista Peninsula in 2012.

In varying degrees, local and regional extinction, long-distance colonization, and local recruitment may all contribute to the exceptional character of these communities(5). Also, it is debated whether mountain endemics mostly originate from local lowland taxa, or from lineages that reach the mountain by long-range dispersal from cool localities elsewhere(6). Here we investigate the evolutionary routes to endemism by sampling an entire tropical mountain biota on the 4,095-metre-high Mount Kinabalu in Sabah, East Malaysia. We discover that most of its unique biodiversity is younger than the mountain itself (6 million years), and comprises a mix of immigrant pre-adapted lineages and descendants from local lowland ancestors, although substantial shifts from lower to higher vegetation zones in this latter group were rare. These insights could improve forecasts of the likelihood of extinction and 'evolutionary rescue'(7) in montane biodiversity hot spots under climate change scenarios.","[Merckx, Vincent S. F.

Forces required to power these changes are generated by non-muscle myosin II (MyoII) motor proteins pulling filamentous actin (F-actin). Actomyosin networks undergo cycles of assembly and disassembly (pulses)(1,2) to cause cell deformations alternating with steps of stabilization to result in irreversible shape changes(3-6). Although this ratchet-like behaviour operates in a variety of contexts, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Here we investigate the role of MyoII regulation through the conserved Rho1-Rok pathway(7) during Drosophila melanogaster germband extension. This morphogenetic process is powered by cell intercalation, which involves the shrinkage of junctions in the dorsal-ventral axis (vertical junctions) followed by junction extension in the anterior-posterior axis(8). While polarized flows of medial-apical MyoII pulses deform vertical junctions, MyoII enrichment on these junctions (planar polarity) stabilizes them(6). We identify two critical properties of MyoII dynamics that underlie stability and pulsatility: exchange kinetics governed by phosphorylation-dephosphorylation cycles of the MyoII regulatory light chain; and advection due to contraction of the motors on F-actin networks. Spatial control over MyoII exchange kinetics establishes two stable regimes of high and low dissociation rates, resulting in MyoII planar polarity. Pulsatility emerges at intermediate dissociation rates, enabling convergent advection of MyoII and its upstream regulators Rho1 GTP, Rok and MyoII phosphatase. Notably, pulsatility is not an outcome of an upstream Rho1 pacemaker. Rather, it is a self-organized system that involves positive and negative biomechanical feedback between MyoII advection and dissociation rates.","[Munjal, Akankshi; Philippe, Jean-Marc; Lecuit, Thomas] Aix Marseille Univ, CNRS, IBDM UMR7288, F-13009 Marseille, France; [Munro, Edwin] Univ Chicago, Dept Mol Genet & Cell Biol, Chicago, IL 60637 USA","Lecuit, T (reprint author), Aix Marseille Univ, CNRS, IBDM UMR7288, F-13009 Marseille, France.",thomas.lecuit@univ-amu.fr,,,Labex INFORM [ANR-11-LABX-0054]; ANR Archiplast; ERC (Biomecamorph) [323027]; HFSP; Ministere de l'Education nationale; Association pour la Recherche contre le Cancer (ARC); France-BioImaging/PICsL infrastructure [ANR-10-INSB-04-01],"We thank M.

Some mammals, however, exhibit genetic resistance to hypoxia-induced pulmonary hypertension(1-3). We used a congenic breeding program and comparative genomics to exploit this variation in the rat and identified the gene Slc39a12 as a major regulator of hypoxia-induced pulmonary vascular remodelling. Slc39a12 encodes the zinc transporter ZIP12. Here we report that ZIP12 expression is increased in many cell types, including endothelial, smooth muscle and interstitial cells, in the remodelled pulmonary arterioles of rats, cows and humans susceptible to hypoxia-induced pulmonary hypertension. We show that ZIP12 expression in pulmonary vascular smooth muscle cells is hypoxia dependent and that targeted inhibition of ZIP12 inhibits the rise in intracellular labile zinc in hypoxia-exposed pulmonary vascular smooth muscle cells and their proliferation in culture. We demonstrate that genetic disruption of ZIP12 expression attenuates the development of pulmonary hypertension in rats housed in a hypoxic atmosphere. This new and unexpected insight into the fundamental role of a zinc transporter in mammalian pulmonary vascular homeostasis suggests a new drug target for the pharmacological management of pulmonary hypertension.","[Zhao, Lan; Oliver, Eduardo; Dubois, Olivier D.; Cotroneo, Emanuele; Chen, Chien-Nien; Wang, Lei; Arce, Cristina; Wilkins, Martin R.] Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Hammersmith Hosp, Ctr Pharmacol & Therapeut, Div Expt Med, London W12 0NN, England; [Rutter, Guy A.] Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Hammersmith Hosp, Sect Cell Biol & Funct Genom, Div Diabet Endocrinol & Metab, London W12 0NN, England; [Ponsa-Cobas, Joan; Ferrer, Jorge] Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Hammersmith Hosp, Fac Med, Sect Epigen & Dis,Dept Med, London W12 0NN, England; [Maratou, Klio; Atanur, Santosh S.; Chabosseau, Pauline L.; Aitman, Timothy J.] Hammersmith Hosp, Med Res Council Clin Sci Ctr, Physiol Genom & Med Grp, London W12 0NN, England; [Moyon, Benjamin; Webster, Zoe] Hammersmith Hosp, Med Res Council Clin Sci Ctr, Transgen & Embryon Stem Cell Lab, London W12 0NN, England; [Aldashev, Almaz] Inst Mol Biol & Med, Bishkek 720040, Kyrgyzstan; [Frid, Maria G.; Stenmark, Kurt R.] Univ Colorado, Dept Pediat & Med, Div Crit Care Med, Denver, CO 80045 USA; [Frid, Maria G.; Stenmark, Kurt R.] Univ Colorado, Cardiovasc Pulm Res Labs, Denver, CO 80045 USA","Zhao, L (reprint author), Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Hammersmith Hosp, Ctr Pharmacol & Therapeut, Div Expt Med, London W12 0NN, England.",l.zhao@imperial.ac.uk,"Oliver, Eduardo/D-4971-2012; Ferrer, Jorge/A-3176-2012","Oliver, Eduardo/0000-0001-9340-882X; Ferrer, Jorge/0000-0002-5959-5729","British Heart Foundation [PG/95170, PG/98018, PG/2000137, PG/04/035/16912, PG/12/61/29818, PG/10/59/28478, RG/10/16/28575]; Wellcome Trust [WT098424AIA]; MRC [MR/J0003042/1]; Royal Society; European Research Council [268880]","This research was supported by successive grants from British Heart Foundation to M.R.W. and L.Z.

The pathogenesis of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) requires high levels of autophagy(2-4), a conserved self-degradative process(5). However, the regulatory circuits that activate autophagy and reprogram PDA cell metabolism are unknown. Here we show that autophagy induction in PDA occurs as part of a broader transcriptional program that coordinates activation of lysosome biogenesis and function, and nutrient scavenging, mediated by the MiT/TFE family of transcription factors. In human PDA cells, the MiT/TFE proteins(6)-MITF, TFE3 and TFEB-are decoupled from regulatory mechanisms that control their cytoplasmic retention. Increased nuclear import in turn drives the expression of a coherent network of genes that induce high levels of lysosomal catabolic function essential for PDA growth. Unbiased global metabolite profiling reveals that MiT/TFE-dependent autophagy-lysosome activation is specifically required to maintain intracellular amino acid pools. These results identify the MiT/TFE proteins as master regulators of metabolic reprogramming in pancreatic cancer and demonstrate that transcriptional activation of clearance pathways converging on the lysosome is a novel hallmark of aggressive malignancy.","[Perera, RushikaM.; Stoykova, Svetlana; Nicolay, Brandon N.; Ross, Kenneth N.; Fitamant, Julien; Boukhali, Myriam; Lengrand, Justine; Ferrone, Cristina R.; Settleman, Jeff; Dyson, Nicholas J.; Ramaswamy, Sridhar; Haas, Wilhelm; Bardeesy, Nabeel] Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Ctr Canc Res, Boston, MA 02114 USA; [Perera, RushikaM.; Stoykova, Svetlana; Ross, Kenneth N.; Fitamant, Julien; Lengrand, Justine; Ramaswamy, Sridhar; Bardeesy, Nabeel] Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Ctr Regenerat Med, Boston, MA 02114 USA; [Perera, RushikaM.; Nicolay, Brandon N.; Ross, Kenneth N.; Fitamant, Julien; Deshpande, Vikram; Ferrone, Cristina R.; Dyson, Nicholas J.; Ramaswamy, Sridhar; Haas, Wilhelm; Bardeesy, Nabeel] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Med, Boston, MA 02114 USA; [Deshpande, Vikram; Selig, Martin K.] Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Dept Pathol, Boston, MA 02114 USA; [Ferrone, Cristina R.] Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Dept Surg, Boston, MA 02114 USA; [Stephanopoulos, Gregory] MIT, Dept Chem Engn, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Zoncu, Roberto] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mol & Cell Biol, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA","Bardeesy, N (reprint author), Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Ctr Canc Res, Boston, MA 02114 USA.",Bardeesy.Nabeel@MGH.Harvard.edu,"di Ronza, Alberto/H-7674-2016","di Ronza, Alberto/0000-0002-9813-5143","National Institutes of Health [P50CA1270003, P01 CA117969-07, R01 CA133557-05]; Linda J.

Over the past 30 million years, they have helped to moderate Earth's climate by absorbing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, sequestering it via the biological carbon pump and ultimately burying organic carbon in the lithosphere(1). The proportion of planetary primary production by diatoms in the modern oceans is roughly equivalent to that of terrestrial rainforests(2). In photosynthesis, the efficient conversion of carbon dioxide into organic matter requires a tight control of the ATP/NADPHratio which, in other photosynthetic organisms, relies principally on a range of plastid-localized ATP generating processes(3-6). Here we show that diatoms regulate ATP/NADPH through extensive energetic exchanges between plastids and mitochondria. This interaction comprises the re-routing of reducing power generated in the plastid towards mitochondria and the import of mitochondrial ATP into the plastid, and is mandatory for optimized carbon fixation and growth. We propose that the process may have contributed to the ecological success of diatoms in the ocean.","[Bailleul, Benjamin; Berne, Nicolas; Cardol, Pierre] Univ Liege, Dept Sci Vie & PhytoSYST, Genet & Physiol Microalgues, B-4000 Liege, Belgium; [Bailleul, Benjamin; Falkowski, Paul G.] Rutgers State Univ, Environm Biophys & Mol Ecol Program, Dept Marine & Coastal Sci, New Brunswick, NJ 08901 USA; [Bailleul, Benjamin; Falkowski, Paul G.] Rutgers State Univ, Environm Biophys & Mol Ecol Program, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, New Brunswick, NJ 08901 USA; [Bailleul, Benjamin; Rappaport, Fabrice; Joliot, Pierre] Univ Paris 06, CNRS, IBPC, UMR 7141, F-75005 Paris, France; [Bailleul, Benjamin; Murik, Omer; Prihoda, Judit; Tanaka, Atsuko; Tirichine, Leila; Bowler, Chris] PSL Res Univ, Ecole Normale Super, IBENS, CNRS,UMR 8197,INSERM,U1024, F-75005 Paris, France; [Petroutsos, Dimitris; Bligny, Richard; Flori, Serena; Falconet, Denis; Finazzi, Giovanni] Univ Grenoble Alpes, Inst Rech Sci & Technol Vivant iRTSV, Lab Physiol Cellulaire & Vegetale, UMR 5168,CNRS,CEA,INRA,CEA Grenoble, F-38054 Grenoble 9, France; [Villanova, Valeria] Fermentalg SA, F-33500 Libourne, France; [Krieger-Liszkay, Anja] Univ Paris 11, Inst Biol & Technol Saclay, Inst Integrat Biol Cell I2BC, CEA,CNRS, F-91191 Gif Sur Yvette, France; [Santabarbara, Stefano] CNR, Ist Biofis, I-20133 Milan, Italy","Bailleul, B (reprint author), Univ Liege, Dept Sci Vie & PhytoSYST, Genet & Physiol Microalgues, B-4000 Liege, Belgium.",bailleul@ibpc.fr; cbowler@biologie.ens.fr; giovanni.finazzi@cea.fr,"Petroutsos, Dimitris/E-4958-2011","Petroutsos, Dimitris/0000-0002-9656-661X; Santabarbara, Stefano/0000-0002-7993-2614; Bowler, Chris/0000-0003-3835-6187","Agence Nationale de la Recherche [ANR-12-BIME-0005, ANR-8NT09567009, ANR-11-LABX-0011-01, ANR-11-IDEX-0001-02, ANR-10-LABX-54]; Region Rhone-Alpes; Marie Curie Initial Training Network Accliphot [316427]; ERC; EU; CNRS Defi; CEA Bioenergies program; Belgian Fonds de la Recherche Scientifique F.R.S.-F.N.R.S.

PINK1 is stabilized on the outside of depolarized mitochondria and phosphorylates polyubiquitin(4-8) as well as the PARKIN ubiquitin-like (Ubl) domain(9,10). These phosphorylation events lead to PARKIN recruitment to mitochondria, and activation by an unknown allosteric mechanism(4-12). Here we present the crystal structure of Pediculus humanus PARKIN in complex with Ser65-phosphorylated ubiquitin (phosphoUb), revealing the molecular basis for PARKIN recruitment and activation. The phosphoUb binding site on PARKIN comprises a conserved phosphate pocket and harbours residues mutated in patients with AR-JP. PhosphoUb binding leads to straightening of a helix in the RING1 domain, and the resulting conformational changes release the Ubl domain from the PARKIN core; this activates PARKIN. Moreover, phosphoUb-mediated Ubl release enhances Ubl phosphorylation by PINK1, leading to conformational changes within the Ubl domain and stabilization of an open, active conformation of PARKIN. We redefine the role of the Ubl domain not only as an inhibitory(13) but also as an activating element that is restrained in inactive PARKIN and released by phosphoUb.

We obtain spectra of the mu OR in the absence of ligand, and in the presence of the high-affinity agonist BU72 alone, or with BU72 and a G protein mimetic nanobody. Our results show that conformational changes in transmembrane segments 5 and 6 (TM5 and TM6), which are required for the full engagement of a G protein, are almost completely dependent on the presence of both the agonist and the G protein mimetic nanobody, revealing a weak allosteric coupling between the agonist-binding pocket and the G-protein-coupling interface (TM5 and TM6), similar to that observed for the beta 2-adrenergic receptor(3). Unexpectedly, in the presence of agonist alone, we find larger spectral changes involving intracellular loop 1 and helix 8 compared to changes in TM5 and TM6. These results suggest that one or both of these domains may play a role in the initial interaction with the G protein, and that TM5 and TM6 are only engaged later in the process of complex formation. The initial interactions between the G protein and intracellular loop 1 and/or helix 8 may be involved in G-protein coupling specificity, as has been suggested for other family A G-protein-coupled receptors.","[Sounier, Remy; Mas, Camille; Granier, Sebastien] Univ Montpellier, Inst Genom Fonct, CNRS, INSERM,U1191,UMR 5203, F-34000 Montpellier, France; [Steyaert, Jan; Laeremans, Toon] Vrije Univ Brussel, Struct Biol Brussels, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium; [Steyaert, Jan; Laeremans, Toon] VIB, Struct Biol Res Ctr, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium; [Manglik, Aashish; Huang, Weijiao; Kobilka, Brian K.] Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Dept Mol & Cellular Physiol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Demene, Helene] Univ Montpellier, Ctr Biochim Struct, CNRS, INSERM 1054,UMR 5048, F-34090 Montpellier, France","Granier, S (reprint author), Univ Montpellier, Inst Genom Fonct, CNRS, INSERM,U1191,UMR 5203, F-34000 Montpellier, France.",helene@cbs.cnrs.fr; sebastien.granier@igf.cnrs.fr,"Steyaert, Jan/H-4662-2011; Granier, Sebastien/J-1089-2016","Steyaert, Jan/0000-0002-3825-874X; ",INSERM; CNRS; National Institutes of Health [NIDA-DA036246],We acknowledge support from INSERM (S.G.) and CNRS (H.D.) and from the National Institutes of Health Grant (NIDA-DA036246 to B.K.K. and S.G.).

Given that there are similar to 800 human GPCRs and 16 different G alpha genes, this raises the question of whether a universal allosteric mechanism governs G alpha activation. Here we show that different GPCRs interact with and activate G alpha proteins through a highly conserved mechanism. Comparison of G alpha with the small G protein Ras reveals how the evolution of short segments that undergo disorder-to-order transitions can decouple regions important for allosteric activation from receptor binding specificity. This might explain how the GPCR-G alpha system diversified rapidly, while conserving the allosteric activation mechanism.","[Flock, Tilman; Ravarani, Charles N. J.; Venkatakrishnan, A.

The descendants of pericentral cells differentiate into Tbx3-negative, polyploid hepatocytes, and can replace all hepatocytes along the liver lobule during homeostatic renewal. Adjacent central vein endothelial cells provide Wnt signals that maintain the pericentral cells, thereby constituting the niche.

A central step in this replication is the assembly of the heterohexameric minichromosome maintenance (MCM2-7) helicase complex at replication origins during G1 phase as an inactive double hexamer. Here, using cryo-electron microscopy, we report a near-atomic structure of the MCM2-7 double hexamer purified from yeast G1 chromatin. Our structure shows that two single hexamers, arranged in a tilted and twisted fashion through interdigitated amino-terminal domain interactions, form a kinked central channel. Four constricted rings consisting of conserved interior beta-hairpins from the two single hexamers create a narrow passageway that tightly fits duplex DNA. This narrow passageway, reinforced by the offset of the two single hexamers at the double hexamer interface, is flanked by two pairs of gate-forming subunits, MCM2 and MCM5. These unusual features of the twisted and tilted single hexamers suggest a concerted mechanism for the melting of origin DNA that requires structural deformation of the intervening DNA.","[Li, Ningning; Zhang, Yixiao; Li, Wanqiu; Yang, Maojun; Lei, Jianlin; Gao, Ning] Tsinghua Univ, Sch Life Sci, Struct Biol Ctr, Minist Educ,Key Lab Prot Sci, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China; [Zhai, Yuanliang; Tye, Bik-Kwoon] Hong Kong Univ Sci & Technol, Div Life Sci, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Zhai, Yuanliang] Hong Kong Univ Sci & Technol, Inst Adv Study, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Tye, Bik-Kwoon] Cornell Univ, Dept Mol Biol & Genet, Coll Agr & Life Sci, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA","Gao, N (reprint author), Tsinghua Univ, Sch Life Sci, Struct Biol Ctr, Minist Educ,Key Lab Prot Sci, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China.",zhai@ust.hk; bt16@cornell.edu; ninggao@tsinghua.edu.cn,"Gao, Ning/J-9623-2012","Gao, Ning/0000-0003-3067-9993","Ministry of Science and Technology of China [2013CB910404]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [31422016]; Research Grants Council of Hong Kong [GRF664013, HKUST12/CRF/13G]; Hong Kong University of Science Technology","We thank X.

Hydrodynamic simulations suggest that 'cold accretion flows'-relatively cool (temperatures of the order of 104 kelvin), unshocked gas streaming along filaments of the cosmic web into dark-matter halos(1-3)-are important. These flows are thought to deposit gas and angular momentum into the circumgalactic medium, creating disk-or ring-like structures that eventually coalesce into galaxies that form at filamentary intersections(4,5). Recently, a large and luminous filament, consistent with such a cold accretion flow, was discovered near the quasi-stellar object QSO UM287 at redshift 2.279 using narrow-band imaging(6). Unfortunately, imaging is not sufficient to constrain the physical characteristics of the filament, to determine its kinematics, to explain how it is linked to nearby sources, or to account for its unusual brightness, more than a factor of ten above what is expected for a filament. Here we report a two-dimensional spectroscopic investigation of the emitting structure. We find that the brightest emission region is an extended rotating hydrogen disk with a velocity profile that is characteristic of gas in a darkmatter halo with a mass of 10(13) solar masses. This giant protogalactic disk appears to be connected to a quiescent filament that may extend beyond the virial radius of the halo. The geometry is strongly suggestive of a cold accretion flow.","[Martin, D.

This CPT invariance implies that the fundamental properties of antiparticles and their matter-conjugates are identical, apart from signs. There is a deep link between CPT invariance and Lorentz symmetry-that is, the laws of nature seem to be invariant under the symmetry transformation of spacetime-although it is model dependent(2). A number of high-precision CPT and Lorentz invariance tests-using a co-magnetometer, a torsion pendulum and a maser, among others-have been performed(3), but only a few direct high-precision CPT tests that compare the fundamental properties of matter and antimatter are available(4-8). Here we report high-precision cyclotron frequency comparisons of a single antiproton and a negatively charged hydrogen ion (H-) carried out in a Penning trap system. From 13,000 frequency measurements we compare the charge-to-mass ratio for the antiproton (q/m)(p)- to that for the proton (q/m)(p) and obtain (q/m)(p)/(q/m)(p) - 1 - 1(69) x 10(-12). The measurements were performed at cyclotron frequencies of 29.6 megahertz, so our result shows that the CPT theorem holds at the atto-electronvolt scale. Our precision of 69 parts per trillion exceeds the energy resolution of previous antiproton-toproton mass comparisons(7,9) as well as the respective figure of merit of the standardmodel extension(10) by a factor of four. In addition, we give a limit on sidereal variations in the measured ratio of <720 parts per trillion. By following the arguments of ref. 11, our result can be interpreted as a stringent test of the weak equivalence principle of general relativity using baryonic antimatter, and it sets a new limit on the gravitational anomaly parameter of vertical bar alpha(g) - 1 vertical bar < 8.7 x 10(-7).","[Ulmer, S.; Smorra, C.; Mooser, A.; Franke, K.; Nagahama, H.; Schneider, G.; Higuchi, T.] RIKEN, Ulmer Initiat Res Unit, Wako, Saitama 3510198, Japan; [Smorra, C.] CERN, CH-1211 Geneva, Switzerland; [Franke, K.; Blaum, K.] Max Planck Inst Kernphys, D-69117 Heidelberg, Germany; [Nagahama, H.; Higuchi, T.; Matsuda, Y.] Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Arts & Sci, Tokyo 1538902, Japan; [Schneider, G.; Walz, J.] Johannes Gutenberg Univ Mainz, Inst Phys, D-55099 Mainz, Germany; [Van Gorp, S.; Yamazaki, Y.] RIKEN, Atom Phys Lab, Wako, Saitama 3510198, Japan; [Quint, W.] GSI Helmholtzzentrum Schwerionenforsch, D-64291 Darmstadt, Germany; [Walz, J.] Helmholtz Inst Mainz, D-55099 Mainz, Germany","Ulmer, S (reprint author), RIKEN, Ulmer Initiat Res Unit, 2-1 Hirosawa, Wako, Saitama 3510198, Japan.",stefan.ulmer@cern.ch,"Lu, YuCheng/L-2929-2015; Yamazaki, Yasunori/N-8018-2015; Matsuda, Yasuyuki/C-3007-2008; Smorra, Christian/C-5606-2017","Yamazaki, Yasunori/0000-0001-5712-0853; Matsuda, Yasuyuki/0000-0002-9847-3791; ",Antiproton Decelerator group; CERN groups; RIKEN Initiative Research Unit Program; RIKEN; RIKEN FPR; RIKEN JRA Program; MEXT [24000008]; Max-Planck Society; IMPRS-PTFS; EU (ERC) [290870-MEFUCO]; BMBF; Helmholtz-Gemeinschaft; CERN,"We acknowledge support by the Antiproton Decelerator group and all other CERN groups which provide support to Antiproton Decelerator experiments.

Thermal cycling induces internal stresses, leading to structural and property changes that are usually deleterious. Glasses are the solids that form on cooling a liquid if crystallization is avoided-they might be considered the ultimate, uniform solids, without the microstructural features and defects associated with polycrystals. Here we explore the effects of cryogenic thermal cycling on glasses, specifically metallic glasses. We show that, contrary to the null effect expected from uniformity, thermal cycling induces rejuvenation, reaching less relaxed states of higher energy. We interpret these findings in the context that the dynamics in liquids become heterogeneous on cooling towards the glass transition(1), and that there may be consequent heterogeneities in the resulting glasses. For example, the vibrational dynamics of glassy silica at long wavelengths are those of an elastic continuum, but at wavelengths less than approximately three nanometres the vibrational dynamics are similar to those of a polycrystal with anisotropic grains(2). Thermal cycling of metallic glasses is easily applied, and gives improvements in compressive plasticity. The fact that such effects can be achieved is attributed to intrinsic non-uniformity of the glass structure, giving a non-uniform coefficient of thermal expansion. While metallic glasses may be particularly suitable for thermal cycling, the non-affine nature of strains in glasses in general deserves further study, whether they are induced by applied stresses or by temperature change.","[Ketov, S.

Both techniques are scalable, and scientists and engineers are adapting them to different two-dimensional starting materials to create structures from the macro-to the microscale(1,2). Here we show that graphene(3-6) is well suited for kirigami, allowing us to build robust microscale structures with tunable mechanical properties. The material parameter crucial for kirigami is the Foppl-von Karman number(7,8) gamma: an indication of the ratio between in-plane stiffness and out-of-plane bending stiffness, with high numbers corresponding to membranes that more easily bend and crumple than they stretch and shear. To determine gamma, we measure the bending stiffness of graphene monolayers that are 10-100 micrometres in size and obtain a value that is thousands of times higher than the predicted atomic-scale bending stiffness. Interferometric imaging attributes this finding to ripples in the membrane(9-13) that stiffen the graphene sheets considerably, to the extent that gamma is comparable to that of a standard piece of paper. We may therefore apply ideas from kirigami to graphene sheets to build mechanical metamaterials such as stretchable electrodes, springs, and hinges. These results establish graphene kirigami as a simple yet powerful and customizable approach for fashioning one-atom-thick graphene sheets into resilient and movable parts with microscale dimensions.","[Blees, Melina K.; Rose, Peter A.; Roberts, Samantha P.; McGill, Kathryn L.; Kevek, Joshua W.; Kobrin, Bryce; McEuen, Paul L.] Cornell Univ, Lab Atom & Solid State Phys, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Barnard, Arthur W.; Huang, Pinshane Y.; Muller, David A.] Cornell Univ, Sch Appl & Engn Phys, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Ruyack, Alexander R.] Cornell Univ, Sch Elect & Comp Engn, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Muller, David A.; McEuen, Paul L.] Cornell Univ, Kavli Inst, Cornell Nanoscale Sci, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA","McEuen, PL (reprint author), Cornell Univ, Lab Atom & Solid State Phys, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",plm23@cornell.edu,"McGill, Kathryn/N-4438-2013","McGill, Kathryn/0000-0002-8841-6910; Huang, Pinshane/0000-0002-1095-1833","Cornell Center for Materials Research (National Science Foundation, NSF) [DMR-1120296]; Office of Naval Research [N00014-13-1-0749]; Kavli Institute at Cornell for Nanoscale Science; NSF [ECCS-0335765]; NSF Graduate Research Fellowship Program [DGE-1144153, DGE-0707428]; SBIR [DE-SC0011385]","We thank D.

The utility of a synthetic method may be greatly reduced if it relies on a glove box to enable the use of air- and moisture-sensitive reagents or catalysts. Furthermore, many synthetic chemistry laboratories have numerous containers of partially used reagents that have been spoiled by exposure to the ambient atmosphere. This is exceptionally wasteful from both an environmental and a cost perspective. Here we report an encapsulation method for stabilizing and storing air-and moisture-sensitive compounds. We demonstrate this approach in three contexts, by describing single-use capsules that contain all of the reagents (catalysts, ligands, and bases) necessary for the glove-box-free palladium-catalysed carbon-fluorine(7-9), carbon-nitrogen(10,11,) and carbon-carbon(12) bond-forming reactions. This strategy should reduce the number of error-prone, tedious and time-consuming weighing procedures required for such syntheses and should be applicable to a wide range of reagents, catalysts, and substrate combinations.","[Sather, Aaron C.; Lee, Hong Geun; Colombe, James R.; Zhang, Anni; Buchwald, Stephen L.] MIT, Dept Chem, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA","Buchwald, SL (reprint author), MIT, Dept Chem, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",sbuchwal@mit.edu,,,"National Institutes of Health [R01GM46059, 1F32GM108092-01A1]; National Science Foundation [1122374]","Research reported in this publication was supported by the National Institutes of Health under award number R01GM46059.

It is often proposed as a mechanism for the uplifting of deep crustal rocks ('thick-skinned' deformation) far from plate boundaries, and for causing unusual patterns of volcanism, as far back as the Proterozoic eon(1). For example, the formation of the expansive Rocky Mountains and the subsequent voluminous volcanism across much of the western USA has been attributed to a broad region of flat-slab subduction beneath North America that occurred during the Laramide orogeny (80-55 million years ago)(2). Here we study the largest modern flat slab, located in Peru, to better understand the processes controlling the formation and extent of flat slabs. We present new data that indicate that the subducting Nazca Ridge is necessary for the development and continued support of the horizontal plate at a depth of about 90 kilometres. By combining constraints from Rayleigh wave phase velocities with improved earthquake locations, we find that the flat slab is shallowest along the ridge, while to the northwest of the ridge, the slab is sagging, tearing, and re-initiating normal subduction. On the basis of our observations, we propose a conceptual model for the temporal evolution of the Peruvian flat slab in which the flat slab forms because of the combined effects of trench retreat along the Peruvian plate boundary, suction, and ridge subduction. We find that while the ridge is necessary but not sufficient for the formation of the flat slab, its removal is sufficient for the flat slab to fail. This provides new constraints on our understanding of the processes controlling the beginning and end of the Laramide orogeny and other putative episodes of flat-slab subduction.","[Antonijevic, Sanja Knezevic; Kumar, Abhash] Univ N Carolina, Dept Geol Sci, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA; [Wagner, Lara S.] Carnegie Inst Sci, Dept Terr Magnetism, Washington, DC 20015 USA; [Beck, Susan L.; Zandt, George] Univ Arizona, Dept Geosci, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA; [Long, Maureen D.] Yale Univ, Dept Geol & Geophys, New Haven, CT 06511 USA; [Tavera, Hernando; Condori, Cristobal] Inst Geofis Peru, Lima 15012, Peru","Antonijevic, SK (reprint author), Univ N Carolina, Dept Geol Sci, CB 3315, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA.",sknezevi@live.unc.edu,"Long, Maureen/A-1383-2009","Long, Maureen/0000-0003-1936-3840; Knezevic Antonijevic, Sanja/0000-0003-4224-5746; Condori Quispe, Cristobal/0000-0003-2657-147X; Wagner, Lara/0000-0001-7130-7761","NSF [EAR-0944184, EAR-0943991, EAR-0943962, EAR-0908777, EAR-0907880]","We thank R.

Three chromosomal segments of Neanderthal ancestry are over 50 centimorgans in size, indicating that this individual had a Neanderthal ancestor as recently as four to six generations back.

They have the largest nervous systems among the invertebrates(2) and present other striking morphological innovations including camera-like eyes, prehensile arms, a highly derived early embryogenesis and a remarkably sophisticated adaptive colouration system(1,3). To investigate the molecular bases of cephalopod brain and body innovations, we sequenced the genome and multiple transcriptomes of the California two-spot octopus, Octopus bimaculoides. We found no evidence for hypothesized whole-genome duplications in the octopus lineage(4-6). The core developmental and neuronal gene repertoire of the octopus is broadly similar to that found across invertebrate bilaterians, except for massive expansions in two gene families previously thought to be uniquely enlarged in vertebrates: the protocadherins, which regulate neuronal development, and the C2H2 superfamily of zinc-finger transcription factors. Extensive messenger RNA editing generates transcript and protein diversity in genes involved in neural excitability, as previously described(7), as well as in genes participating in a broad range of other cellular functions. We identified hundreds of cephalopod-specific genes, many of which showed elevated expression levels in such specialized structures as the skin, the suckers and the nervous system. Finally, we found evidence for large-scale genomic rearrangements that are closely associated with transposable element expansions. Our analysis suggests that substantial expansion of a handful of gene families, along with extensive remodelling of genome linkage and repetitive content, played a critical role in the evolution of cephalopod morphological innovations, including their large and complex nervous systems.","[Albertin, Caroline B.; Ragsdale, Clifton W.] Univ Chicago, Dept Organismal Biol & Anat, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Simakov, Oleg; Edsinger-Gonzales, Eric; Brenner, Sydney; Rokhsar, Daniel S.] Grad Univ, Okinawa Inst Sci & Technol, Onna, Okinawa 9040495, Japan; [Simakov, Oleg] Heidelberg Univ, Ctr Organismal Studies, D-69117 Heidelberg, Germany; [Mitros, Therese; Edsinger-Gonzales, Eric; Rokhsar, Daniel S.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mol & Cell Biol, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Wang, Z.

The same principles have also found broad application in human genomics, driven by the need to interpret the pathogenic potential of variants in patients(2). Here we performed a systematic comparative genomics analysis of human disease-causing missense variants. We found that an appreciable fraction of disease-causing alleles are fixed in the genomes of other species, suggesting a role for genomic context. We developed a model of genetic interactions that predicts most of these to be simple pairwise compensations. Functional testing of this model on two known human disease genes(3,4) revealed discrete cis amino acid residues that, although benign on their own, could rescue the human mutations in vivo. This approach was also applied to ab initio gene discovery to support the identification of a de novo disease driver in BTG2 that is subject to protective cis-modification in more than 50 species. Finally, on the basis of our data and models, we developed a computational tool to predict candidate residues subject to compensation. Taken together, our data highlight the importance of cis-genomic context as a contributor to protein evolution; they provide an insight into the complexity of allele effect on phenotype; and they are likely to assist methods for predicting allele pathogenicity(5,6).","[Jordan, Daniel M.; Cassa, Christopher A.; Sunyaev, Shamil R.] Brigham & Womens Hosp, Dept Med, Div Genet, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Jordan, Daniel M.; Cassa, Christopher A.; Sunyaev, Shamil R.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Frangakis, Stephan G.; Golzio, Christelle; Davis, Erica E.; Katsanis, Nicholas] Duke Univ, Ctr Human Dis Modeling, Durham, NC 27701 USA; [Kurtzberg, Joanne] Duke Univ, Dept Pediat, Div Pediat Blood & Marrow Transplantat, Durham, NC 27701 USA","Sunyaev, SR (reprint author), Brigham & Womens Hosp, Dept Med, Div Genet, 75 Francis St, Boston, MA 02115 USA.",ssunyaev@rics.bwh.harvard.edu; nicholas.katsanis@dm.duke.edu,,"Jordan, Daniel/0000-0002-5318-8225",NARSAD;  [R01HD04260];  [R01DK072301];  [R01DK075972];  [R01 GM078598];  [R01 MH101244];  [R01 DK095721];  [U01 HG006500];  [R01EY021872],"We thank Y.

Wired into this network of gene expression control are mechanisms to compensate for gene dosage. The increasing use of reverse genetics in zebrafish, and other model systems, has revealed profound differences between the phenotypes caused by genetic mutations and those caused by gene knockdowns at many loci(1-3), an observation previously reported in mouse and Arabidopsis(4-7). To identify the reasons underlying the phenotypic differences between mutants and knockdowns, we generated mutations in zebrafish egfl7, an endothelial extracellular matrix gene of therapeutic interest, as well as in vegfaa. Here we show that egfl7 mutants do not show any obvious phenotypes while animals injected with egfl7 morpholino (morphants) exhibit severe vascular defects. We further observe that egfl7 mutants are less sensitive than their wild-type siblings to Egfl7 knockdown, arguing against residual protein function in the mutants or significant off-target effects of the morpholinos when used at a moderate dose. Comparing egfl7 mutant and morphant proteomes and transcriptomes, we identify a set of proteins and genes that are upregulated in mutants but not in morphants. Among them are extracellular matrix genes that can rescue egfl7 morphants, indicating that they could be compensating for the loss of Egfl7 function in the phenotypically wild-type egfl7 mutants. Moreover, egfl7 CRISPR interference, which obstructs transcript elongation and causes severe vascular defects, does not cause the upregulation of these genes. Similarly, vegfaa mutants but not morphants show an upregulation of vegfab. Taken together, these data reveal the activation of a compensatory network to buffer against deleterious mutations, which was not observed after translational or transcriptional knockdown.","[Rossi, Andrea; Kontarakis, Zacharias; Gerri, Claudia; Nolte, Hendrik; Hoelper, Soraya; Krueger, Marcus; Stainier, Didier Y.

Mutations in mtDNA can cause fatal or severely debilitating disorders with limited treatment options(2). Clinical manifestations vary based on mutation type and heteroplasmy (that is, the relative levels of mutant and wild-type mtDNA within each cell)(3,4). Here we generated genetically corrected pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) from patients with mtDNA disease. Multiple induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cell lines were derived from patients with common heteroplasmic mutations including 3243A>G, causing mitochondrial encephalomyopathy and stroke-like episodes (MELAS)(5), and 8993T>G and 13513G>A, implicated in Leigh syndrome. Isogenic MELAS and Leigh syndrome iPS cell lines were generated containing exclusively wildtype or mutant mtDNA through spontaneous segregation of heteroplasmic mtDNA in proliferating fibroblasts. Furthermore, somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) enabled replacement of mutant mtDNA from homoplasmic 8993T>G fibroblasts to generate corrected Leigh-NT1 PSCs. Although Leigh-NT1 PSCs contained donor oocyte wild-type mtDNA (human haplotype D4a) that differed from Leigh syndrome patient haplotype (F1a) at a total of 47 nucleotide sites, Leigh-NT1 cells displayed transcriptomic profiles similar to those in embryo-derived PSCs carrying wild-type mtDNA, indicative of normal nuclear-to-mitochondrial interactions. Moreover, genetically rescued patient PSCs displayed normal metabolic function compared to impaired oxygen consumption and ATP production observed in mutant cells. We conclude that both reprogramming approaches offer complementary strategies for derivation of PSCs containing exclusively wild-type mtDNA, through spontaneous segregation of heteroplasmic mtDNA in individual iPS cell lines or mitochondrial replacement by SCNT in homoplasmic mtDNA-based disease.","[Ma, Hong; Ahmed, Riffat; Kang, Eunju; Lee, Yeonmi; Hayama, Tomonari; Li, Ying; Van Dyken, Crystal; Gutierrez, Nuria Marti; Tippner-Hedges, Rebecca; Koski, Amy; Mitalipov, Nargiz; Mitalipov, Shoukhrat] Oregon Hlth & Sci Univ, Ctr Embryon Cell & Gene Therapy, Portland, OR 97239 USA; [Ma, Hong; Ahmed, Riffat; Kang, Eunju; Lee, Yeonmi; Hayama, Tomonari; Li, Ying; Van Dyken, Crystal; Gutierrez, Nuria Marti; Tippner-Hedges, Rebecca; Koski, Amy; Mitalipov, Nargiz; Wolf, Don P.; Mitalipov, Shoukhrat] Oregon Hlth & Sci Univ, Div Reprod & Dev Sci, Oregon Natl Primate Res Ctr, Beaverton, OR 97006 USA; [Folmes, Clifford D.

Eggs develop from oocytes in a process called meiosis. Meiosis inhuman oocytes is highly error-prone(1,2), and defective eggs are the leading cause of pregnancy loss and several genetic disorders such as Down's syndrome(3-5). Which genes safeguard accurate progression through meiosis is largely unclear. Here we develop high-content phenotypic screening methods for the systematic identification of mammalian meiotic genes. We targeted 774 genes by RNA interference within follicle-enclosed mouse oocytes to block protein expression from an early stage of oocyte development onwards. We then analysed the function of several genes simultaneously by high-resolution imaging of chromosomes and microtubules in live oocytes and scored each oocyte quantitatively for 50 phenotypes, generating a comprehensive resource of meiotic gene function. The screen generated an unprecedented annotated data set of meiotic progression in 2,241 mammalian oocytes, which allowed us to analyse systematically which defects are linked to abnormal chromosome segregation during meiosis, identifying progression into anaphase with misaligned chromosomes as well as defects in spindle organization as risk factors. This study demonstrates how high-content screens can be performed in oocytes, and allows systematic studies of meiosis in mammals.","[Pfender, Sybille; Kuznetsov, Vitaliy; Pasternak, Michal; Tischer, Thomas; Santhanam, Balaji; Schuh, Melina] MRC, Mol Biol Lab, Cambridge CB2 0QH, England","Schuh, M (reprint author), MRC, Mol Biol Lab, Francis Crick Ave,Cambridge Biomed Campus, Cambridge CB2 0QH, England.",mschuh@mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk,,"Pasternak, Michal/0000-0001-5407-4273",Boehringer-Ingelheim Fonds; EMBO [ALTF700-2014]; European Research Council [337415]; European Community [241548],"We thank the staff of the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology's Animal and Microscopy Facilities for technical assistance; J.

Sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 (SREBP1), an important transcriptional regulator of lipogenesis, is synthesized as an inactive precursor that binds to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). In response to insulin signalling, SREBP1 is transported from the ER to the Golgi in a COPII-dependent manner, processed by proteases in the Golgi, and then shuttled to the nucleus to induce lipogenic gene expression(3-5); however, the mechanisms underlying enhanced SREBP1 activity in insulin-resistant obesity and diabetes remain unclear. Here we show in mice that CREB regulated transcription coactivator 2 (CRTC2)(6) functions as a mediator of mTOR(7) signalling to modulate COPII-dependent SREBP1 processing. CRTC2 competes with Sec23A, a subunit of the COPII complex(8), to interact with Sec31A, another COPII subunit, thus disrupting SREBP1 transport. During feeding, mTOR phosphorylates CRTC2 and attenuates its inhibitory effect on COPII-dependent SREBP1 maturation. As hepatic overexpression of an mTOR-defective CRTC2 mutant in obese mice improved the lipogenic program and insulin sensitivity, these results demonstrate how the transcriptional coactivator CRTC2 regulates mTOR-mediated lipid homeostasis in the fed state and in obesity.","[Han, Jinbo; Li, Erwei; Chen, Liqun; Zhang, Yuanyuan; Wei, Fangchao; Wang, Yiguo] Tsinghua Univ, Sch Life Sci, Tsinghua Peking Ctr Life Sci, MOE Key Lab Bioinformat, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China; [Liu, Jieyuan; Deng, Haiteng] Tsinghua Univ, Sch Life Sci, Prote Facil, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China","Wang, YG (reprint author), Tsinghua Univ, Sch Life Sci, Tsinghua Peking Ctr Life Sci, MOE Key Lab Bioinformat, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China.",wangyiguo@biomed.tsinghua.edu.cn,,,"1000 Talents Program for Young Scholars; National Science Foundation of China [31322027, 31321003, 31471127]","We thank M.

Healthy metazoan cells effectively eliminate intracellular protein aggregates(3,4,) indicating that efficient disaggregation and/or degradation mechanisms exist. However, metazoans lack the key heat-shock protein disaggregase HSP100 of non-metazoan HSP70-dependent protein disaggregation systems(5,6), and the human HSP70 system alone, even with the crucial HSP110 nucleotide exchange factor, has poor disaggregation activity in vitro4,7. This unresolved conundrum is central to protein quality control biology. Here we show that synergic cooperation between complexed J-protein co-chaperones of classes A and B unleashes highly efficient protein disaggregation activity in human and nematode HSP70 systems. Metazoan mixed-class J-protein complexes are transient, involve complementary charged regions conserved in the J-domains and carboxy-terminal domains of each J-protein class, and are flexible with respect to subunit composition. Complex formation allows J-proteins to initiate transient higher order chaperone structures involving HSP70 and interacting nucleotide exchange factors. A network of cooperative class A and B J-protein interactions therefore provides the metazoan HSP70 machinery with powerful, flexible, and finely regulatable disaggregase activity and a further level of regulation crucial for cellular protein quality control.","[Nillegoda, Nadinath B.; Szlachcic, Anna; Gao, Xuechao; Guilbride, D.

Because the monounsaturated products of SCD are key precursors of membrane phospholipids, cholesterol esters and triglycerides, SCD is pivotal in fatty acid metabolism. Humans have two SCD homologues (SCD1 and SCD5), while mice have four (SCD1-SCD4). SCD1-deficient mice do not become obese or diabetic when fed a high-fat diet because of improved lipid metabolic profiles and insulin sensitivity(5,6). Thus, SCD1 is a pharmacological target in the treatment of obesity, diabetes and other metabolic diseases(7). SCD1 is an integral membrane protein located in the endoplasmic reticulum, and catalyses the formation of a cis-double bond between the ninth and tenth carbons of stearoyl-or palmitoyl-CoA(8,9). The reaction requires molecular oxygen, which is activated by a di-iron centre, and cytochrome b(5), which regenerates the di-iron centre(10). To understand better the structural basis of these characteristics of SCD function, here we crystallize and solve the structure of mouse SCD1 bound to stearoyl-CoA at 2.6 angstrom resolution. The structure shows a novel fold comprising four transmembrane helices capped by a cytosolic domain, and a plausible pathway for lateral substrate access and product egress. The acyl chain of the bound stearoyl-CoA is enclosed in a tunnel buried in the cytosolic domain, and the geometry of the tunnel and the conformation of the bound acyl chain provide a structural basis for the regioselectivity and stereospecificity of the desaturation reaction. The dimetal centre is coordinated by a unique spacial arrangement of nine conserved histidine residues that implies a potentially novel mechanism for oxygen activation. The structure also illustrates a possible route for electron transfer from cytochrome b5 to the di-iron centre.","[Bai, Yonghong; McCoy, Jason G.; Levin, Elena J.; Zhou, Ming] Baylor Coll Med, Verna & Marrs McLean Dept Biochem & Mol Biol, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Sobrado, Pablo; Fox, Brian G.] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Biochem, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Rajashankar, Kanagalaghatta R.] Cornell Univ, Argonne Natl Lab, NE CAT, Argonne, IL 60439 USA; [Rajashankar, Kanagalaghatta R.] Cornell Univ, Argonne Natl Lab, Dept Chem & Chem Biol, Argonne, IL 60439 USA","Zhou, M (reprint author), Baylor Coll Med, Verna & Marrs McLean Dept Biochem & Mol Biol, Houston, TX 77030 USA.",bgfox@biochem.wisc.edu; mzhou@bcm.edu,,,"US National Institutes of Health [R01DK088057, R01GM098878, R01HL086392, U54GM095315, U54GM094584, R01GM050853]; American Heart Association [12EIA8850017]; Cancer Prevention and Research Institute of Texas [R12MZ]; National Institute of General Medical Sciences [P41GM103403]","This work was supported by the US National Institutes of Health (R01DK088057, R01GM098878, R01HL086392, U54GM095315, U54GM094584 and R01GM050853), the American Heart Association (12EIA8850017), and the Cancer Prevention and Research Institute of Texas (R12MZ).

In nearly all the tumours analysed we found bi-allelic inactivation of TP53 and RB1, sometimes by complex genomic rearrangements. Two tumours with wild-type RB1 had evidence of chromothripsis leading to overexpression of cyclin D1 (encoded by the CCND1 gene), revealing an alternative mechanism of Rb1 deregulation. Thus, loss of the tumour suppressors TP53 and RB1 is obligatory in SCLC. We discovered somatic genomic rearrangements of TP73 that create an oncogenic version of this gene, TP73Dex2/3. In rare cases, SCLC tumours exhibited kinase gene mutations, providing a possible therapeutic opportunity for individual patients. Finally, we observed inactivating mutations in NOTCH family genes in 25% of human SCLC. Accordingly, activation of Notch signalling in a pre-clinical SCLC mouse model strikingly reduced the number of tumours and extended the survival of the mutant mice.

How the same machinery can either completely degrade or precisely trim RNA substrates has long remained unexplained. Here we report the crystal structures of a yeast nuclear exosome containing the 9-subunit core, the 3'-5' RNases Rrp44 and Rrp6, and the obligate Rrp6-binding partner Rrp47 in complex with different RNAs. The combined structural and biochemical data of this 12-subunit complex reveal how a single-stranded RNA can reach the Rrp44 or Rrp6 active sites directly or can bind Rrp6 and be threaded via the central channel towards the distal RNase Rrp44. When a bulky RNA is stalled at the entrance of the channel, Rrp6-Rrp47 swings open. The results suggest how the same molecular machine can coordinate processive degradation and partial trimming in an RNA-dependent manner by a concerted swinging mechanism of the two RNase subunits.","[Makino, Debora Lika; Schuch, Benjamin; Stegmann, Elisabeth; Baumgaertner, Marc; Basquin, Claire; Conti, Elena] Max Planck Inst Biochem, Dept Struct Cell Biol, D-82152 Martinsried, Germany","Conti, E (reprint author), Max Planck Inst Biochem, Dept Struct Cell Biol, Klopferspitz 18A, D-82152 Martinsried, Germany.",conti@biochem.mpg.de,,,"Max Planck Gesellschaft; European Commission (ERC Advanced Investigator Grant) [294371]; European Commission (Marie Curie ITN RNPnet); Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft [DFG SFB646, SFB1035, GRK1721, FOR1680]; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (CIPSM); Louis Jeantet Foundation","We would like to thank the MPIB Crystallization Facility and MPIB Core Facility; the beamline scientists at SLS beamlines PXII and PXIII and APS beamline 17-ID-B for assistance with data collection; M.

Selection for survival in the presence of antibiotics produced the first genetic link to multidrug tolerance: a mutant in the Escherichia coli hipA locus. HipA encodes a serine-protein kinase, the multidrug tolerance activity of which is neutralized by binding to the transcriptional regulator HipB and hipBA promoter. The physiological role of HipA in multidrug tolerance, however, has been unclear. Here we show that wild-type HipA contributes to persister formation and that high-persister hipA mutants cause multidrug tolerance in urinary tract infections. Perplexingly, high-persister mutations map to the N-subdomain-1 of HipA far from its active site. Structures of higher-order HipA-HipB-promoter complexes reveal HipA forms dimers in these assemblies via N-subdomain-1 interactions that occlude their active sites. High-persistence mutations, therefore, diminish HipA-HipA dimerization, thereby unleashing HipA to effect multidrug tolerance. Thus, our studies reveal the mechanistic basis of heritable, clinically relevant antibiotic tolerance.","[Schumacher, Maria A.; Min, Jungki; Chinnam, Naga Babu; Brennan, Richard G.] Duke Univ, Sch Med, Dept Biochem, Durham, NC 27710 USA; [Balani, Pooja; Hansen, Sonja; Vulic, Marin; Lewis, Kim] Northeastern Univ, Dept Biol, Antimicrobial Discovery Ctr, Boston, MA 02115 USA","Schumacher, MA (reprint author), Duke Univ, Sch Med, Dept Biochem, Durham, NC 27710 USA.",maria.schumacher@duke.edu; k.lewis@neu.edu; Richard.brennan@duke.edu,"Balani, Pooja/D-8374-2017","Balani, Pooja/0000-0002-6544-8696; chinnam, Naga babu/0000-0001-8925-5365; Min, Jungki/0000-0003-1860-3064; Brennan, Richard/0000-0001-7647-485X","NIAID-GSCID; MD Anderson Trust; Welch Foundation [G-0040]; Duke University School of Medicine; National Institutes of Health [T-R01 AI085585, R01GM061162]; Army Research Office [W911NF-09-1-0278]","We thank the Advanced Light Source and their support staff.

Localizing this optimal, that is, minimal, set of structural nodes, called influencers, is one of the most important problems in network science(4,5). Despite the vast use of heuristic strategies to identify influential spreaders(6-14), the problem remains unsolved. Here we map the problem onto optimal percolation in random networks to identify the minimal set of influencers, which arises by minimizing the energy of a many-body system, where the form of the interactions is fixed by the non-backtracking matrix(15) of the network. Big data analyses reveal that the set of optimal influencers is much smaller than the one predicted by previous heuristic centralities. Remarkably, a large number of previously neglected weakly connected nodes emerges among the optimal influencers. These are topologically tagged as low-degree nodes surrounded by hierarchical coronas of hubs, and are uncovered only through the optimal collective interplay of all the influencers in the network. The present theoretical framework may hold a larger degree of universality, being applicable to other hard optimization problems exhibiting a continuous transition from a known phase(16).","[Morone, Flaviano; Makse, Hernan A.] CUNY City Coll, Levich Inst, New York, NY 10031 USA; [Morone, Flaviano; Makse, Hernan A.] CUNY City Coll, Dept Phys, New York, NY 10031 USA","Makse, HA (reprint author), CUNY City Coll, Levich Inst, New York, NY 10031 USA.",hmakse@lev.ccny.cuny.edu,,,NIH-NIGMS [1R21GM107641]; NSF-PoLS [PHY-1305476]; ARL,"This work was funded by NIH-NIGMS 1R21GM107641 and NSF-PoLS PHY-1305476.

The Stoner criterion explains why iron is ferromagnetic but manganese, for example, is not, even though both elements have an unfilled 3d shell and are adjacent in the periodic table: according to this criterion, the product of the density of states and the exchange integral must be greater than unity for spontaneous spin ordering to emerge(1,2). Here we demonstrate that it is possible to alter the electronic states of non-ferromagnetic materials, such as diamagnetic copper and paramagnetic manganese, to overcome the Stoner criterion and make them ferromagnetic at room temperature. This effect is achieved via interfaces between metallic thin films and C-60 molecular layers. The emergent ferromagnetic state exists over several layers of the metal before being quenched at large sample thicknesses by the material's bulk properties. Although the induced magnetization is easily measurable by magnetometry, low-energy muon spin spectroscopy(3) provides insight into its distribution by studying the depolarization process of low-energy muons implanted in the sample. This technique indicates localized spin-ordered states at, and close to, the metal-molecule interface. Density functional theory simulations suggest a mechanism based on magnetic hardening of the metal atoms, owing to electron transfer(4,5). This mechanism might allow for the exploitation of molecular coupling to design magnetic metamaterials using abundant, non-toxic components such as organic semiconductors. Charge transfer at molecular interfaces may thus be used to control spin polarization or magnetization, with consequences for the design of devices for electronic, power or computing applications (see, for example, refs 6 and 7).","[Al Ma'Mari, Fatma; Moorsom, Timothy; Deacon, William; Ali, Mannan; Wheeler, May C.; Burnell, Gavin; Hickey, Bryan J.; Cespedes, Oscar] Univ Leeds, Sch Phys & Astron, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England; [Teobaldi, Gilberto] Univ Liverpool, Stephenson Inst Renewable Energy, Dept Chem, Liverpool L69 3BX, Merseyside, England; [Prokscha, Thomas; Luetkens, Hubertus] Paul Scherrer Inst, Lab Muon Spin Spect, CH-5232 Villigen, Switzerland; [Lee, Steve; Flokstra, Machiel] Univ St Andrews, Sch Phys & Astron, SUPA, St Andrews KY16 9SS, Fife, Scotland; [Sterbinsky, George E.; Arena, Dario A.] Brookhaven Natl Lab, Photon Sci Directorate, Upton, NY 11973 USA; [MacLaren, Donald A.] Univ Glasgow, Sch Phys & Astron, SUPA, Glasgow G12 8QQ, Lanark, Scotland","Cespedes, O (reprint author), Univ Leeds, Sch Phys & Astron, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England.",o.cespedes@leeds.ac.uk,"Hickey, B J/B-3333-2016; MacLaren, D/A-5568-2010; Lee, Stephen/G-9791-2016; Luetkens, Hubertus/G-1831-2011; Ali, Mannan/P-6098-2017","Hickey, B J/0000-0001-8289-5618; MacLaren, D/0000-0003-0641-686X; Lee, Stephen/0000-0002-2020-3310; TEOBALDI, Gilberto/0000-0001-6068-6786; Burnell, Gavin/0000-0002-9486-0639","Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council [EP/K00512X/1, EP/K036408/1, EP/J01060X/1, EP/I004483/1]; US Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences [DE-AC02-98CH10886]","This work was supported by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council through grants EP/K00512X/1, EP/K036408/1, EP/J01060X/1 and EP/I004483/1.

Among porous solids, this has been achieved for metal-organic frameworks(1-3), but not for the more widely applicable zeolites(4,5), where new materials are usually discovered using exploratory synthesis. Although millions of hypothetical zeolite structures have been proposed(6,7), not enough is known about their synthesis mechanism to allow any given structure to be prepared. Here we present an approach that combines structure solution with structure prediction, and inspires the targeted synthesis of new super-complex zeolites. We used electron diffraction to identify a family of related structures and to discover the structural 'coding' within them. This allowed us to determine the complex, and previously unknown, structure of zeolite ZSM-25 (ref. 8), which has the largest unit-cell volume of all known zeolites (91,554 cubic angstroms) and demonstrates selective CO2 adsorption. By extending our method, we were able to predict other members of a family of increasingly complex, but structurally related, zeolites and to synthesize two more-complex zeolites in the family, PST-20 and PST-25, with much larger cell volumes (166,988 and 275,178 cubic angstroms, respectively) and similar selective adsorption properties. Members of this family have the same symmetry, but an expanding unit cell, and are related by hitherto unrecognized structural principles; we call these family members embedded isoreticular zeolite structures.","[Guo, Peng; Su, Jie; Liu, Leifeng; Zou, Xiaodong] Stockholm Univ, Inorgan & Struct Chem, Dept Mat & Environm Chem, SE-10691 Stockholm, Sweden; [Guo, Peng; Su, Jie; Liu, Leifeng; Zou, Xiaodong] Stockholm Univ, Berzelii Ctr EXSELENT Porous Mat, SE-10691 Stockholm, Sweden; [Shin, Jiho; Min, Jung Gi; Choi, Hyun June; Hong, Suk Bong] POSTECH, Ctr Ordered Nanoporous Mat Synth, Sch Environm Sci & Engn, Pohang 790784, South Korea; [Greenaway, Alex G.; Wright, Paul A.] Univ St Andrews, EaStCHEM Sch Chem, St Andrews KY16 9ST, Fife, Scotland; [Cox, Paul A.] Univ Portsmouth, Sch Pharm & Biomed Sci, Portsmouth PO1 2DT, Hants, England","Hong, SB (reprint author), POSTECH, Ctr Ordered Nanoporous Mat Synth, Sch Environm Sci & Engn, Pohang 790784, South Korea.",sbhong@postech.ac.kr; paw2@st-andrews.ac.uk; xzou@mmk.su.se,,"Greenaway, Alex/0000-0002-8573-9124",Swedish Research Council (VR); Swedish Governmental Agency for Innovation Systems (VINNOVA); Rontgen-Angstrom Cluster through the project grant MATsynCELL; Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation through the project grant 3DEM-NATUR; NCRI [2012R1A3A-2048833]; BK 21-plus programmes through the National Research Foundation of Korea; UK EPSRC [EP/J02077X/1]; Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation,"We acknowledge financial support from the Swedish Research Council (VR), the Swedish Governmental Agency for Innovation Systems (VINNOVA), the Rontgen-Angstrom Cluster through the project grant MATsynCELL, the Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation through the project grant 3DEM-NATUR, the NCRI (2012R1A3A-2048833) and BK 21-plus programmes through the National Research Foundation of Korea, and the UK EPSRC (EP/J02077X/1).

They are the key building blocks of proteins and are present in a broad range of other natural and synthetic compounds. Amides are known to be poor electrophiles, which is typically attributed to the resonance stability of the amide bond(1,2). Although amides can readily be cleaved by enzymes such as proteases(3), it is difficult to selectively break the carbon-nitrogen bond of an amide using synthetic chemistry. Here we demonstrate that amide carbon-nitrogen bonds can be activated and cleaved using nickel catalysts. We use this methodology to convert amides to esters, which is a challenging and underdeveloped transformation. The reaction methodology proceeds under exceptionally mild reaction conditions, and avoids the use of a large excess of an alcohol nucleophile. Density functional theory calculations provide insight into the thermodynamics and catalytic cycle of the amide-to-ester transformation. Our results provide a way to harness amide functional groups as synthetic building blocks and are expected to lead to the further use of amides in the construction of carbon-heteroatom or carbon-carbon bonds using non-precious-metal catalysis.","[Hie, Liana; Nathel, Noah F.

Warming and associated permafrost thaw can expose soil organic carbon and result in mineralization and carbon dioxide (CO2) release(4-6). However, some of this soil organic carbon may be eroded and transferred to rivers(7-9). If it escapes degradation during river transport and is buried in marine sediments, then it can contribute to a longer-term (more than ten thousand years), geological CO2 sink(8-10). Despite this recognition, the erosional flux and fate of particulate organic carbon (POC) in large rivers at high latitudes remains poorly constrained. Here, we quantify the source of POC in the Mackenzie River, the main sediment supplier to the Arctic Ocean(11,12), and assess its flux and fate. We combine measurements of radiocarbon, stable carbon isotopes and element ratios to correct for rock-derived POC10,13,14. Our samples reveal that the eroded biospheric POC has resided in the basin for millennia, with a mean radiocarbon age of 5,800 +/- 800 years, much older than the POC in large tropical rivers(13,14). From the measured biospheric POC content and variability in annual sediment yield(15), we calculate a biospheric POC flux of 2.2(-0.9)(+1.3) teragrams of carbon per year from the Mackenzie River, which is three times the CO2 drawdown by silicate weathering in this basin(16). Offshore, we find evidence for efficient terrestrial organic carbon burial over the Holocene period, suggesting that erosion of organic carbon-rich, high-latitude soils may result in an important geological CO2 sink.","[Hilton, Robert G.] Univ Durham, Dept Geog, Durham DH1 3LE, England; [Galy, Valier] Woods Hole Oceanog Inst, Dept Marine Chem & Geochem, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA; [Gaillardet, Jerome; Dellinger, Mathieu; Bouchez, Julien] Univ Paris Diderot, Inst Phys Globe Paris, Sorbonne Paris Cite, UMR CNRS 7154, F-75005 Paris, France; [Bryant, Charlotte] NERC Radiocarbon Facil, E Kilbride G75 OQF, Lanark, Scotland; [O'Regan, Matt; Coxall, Helen] Stockholm Univ, Dept Geol Sci, SE-10691 Stockholm, Sweden; [Groecke, Darren R.] Univ Durham, Dept Earth Sci, Durham DH1 3LE, England; [Calmels, Damien] Univ Paris 11, Lab GEOPS, UMR CNRS 8148, F-91405 Orsay, France","Hilton, RG (reprint author), Univ Durham, Dept Geog, South Rd, Durham DH1 3LE, England.",r.g.hilton@durham.ac.uk,"Hilton, Robert/C-4890-2013; galy, valier/I-6185-2012; GAILLARDET, Jerome/F-9096-2010","GAILLARDET, Jerome/0000-0001-7982-1159; Dellinger, Mathieu/0000-0002-1770-4333; Grocke, Darren/0000-0003-2296-7530; O'Regan, Matt/0000-0002-6046-1488","Natural Environment Research Council (NERC), UK [1611.0312]; CNRS (OXYMORE); CNRS (CANNIBALT); Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution Arctic Research Initiative; Early Career Research Grant by the British Society for Geomorphology; US National Science Foundation [OCE-0928582]; Royal Society University Fellowship","Radiocarbon measurements were funded by the Natural Environment Research Council (NERC), UK (Allocation 1611.0312) to R.G.H and C.B.

For example, locus coeruleus noradrenaline (also known as norepinephrine) (LC-NE) neurons receive input from and send output to broad regions of the brain and spinal cord, and regulate diverse functions including arousal, attention, mood and sensory gating(1-8). However, it is unclear how LC-NE neurons divide up their brain-wide projection patterns and whether different LC-NE neurons receive differential input. Here we developed a set of viral-genetic tools to quantitatively analyse the input-output relationship of neural circuits, and applied these tools to dissect the LC-NE circuit in mice. Rabies-virus-based input mapping indicated that LC-NE neurons receive convergent synaptic input from many regions previously identified as sending axons to the locus coeruleus, as well as from newly identified presynaptic partners, including cerebellar Purkinje cells. The 'tracing the relationship between input and output' method (or TRIO method) enables trans-synaptic input tracing from specific subsets of neurons based on their projection and cell type. We found that LC-NE neurons projecting to diverse output regions receive mostly similar input. Projection-based viral labelling revealed that LC-NE neurons projecting to one output region also project to all brain regions we examined. Thus, the LC-NE circuit overall integrates information from, and broadcasts to, many brain regions, consistent with its primary role in regulating brain states. At the same time, we uncovered several levels of specificity in certain LC-NE sub-circuits. These tools for mapping output architecture and input-output relationship are applicable to other neuronal circuits and organisms. More broadly, our viral-genetic approaches provide an efficient intersectional means to target neuronal populations based on cell type and projection pattern.","[Schwarz, Lindsay A.; Miyamichi, Kazunari; Gao, Xiaojing J.; Beier, Kevin T.; Weissbourd, Brandon; DeLoach, Katherine E.; Ren, Jing; Luo, Liqun] Stanford Univ, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Schwarz, Lindsay A.; Miyamichi, Kazunari; Gao, Xiaojing J.; Beier, Kevin T.; Weissbourd, Brandon; DeLoach, Katherine E.; Ren, Jing; Luo, Liqun] Stanford Univ, Dept Biol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Miyamichi, Kazunari] Univ Tokyo, Dept Appl Biol Chem, Grad Sch Agr & Life Sci, Tokyo 1138657, Japan; [Beier, Kevin T.; Malenka, Robert C.] Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Nancy Pritzker Lab, Dept Psychiat & Behav Sci, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Ibanes, Sandy; Kremer, Eric J.] Inst Genet Mol Montpellier, CNRS 5535, F-34293 Montpellier, France; [Kremer, Eric J.] Univ Montpellier, F-34000 Montpellier, France","Luo, LQ (reprint author), Stanford Univ, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",lluo@stanford.edu,"Gao, Xiaojing/K-2376-2016; Kremer, Eric /D-3734-2013","Kremer, EJ/0000-0001-6114-7530; Beier, Kevin/0000-0002-4934-1338",Ruth L.

Preliminary analyses of genome sequences of 81 EBOV collected from March to June 2014 from Guinea and Sierra Leone suggest that the 2014 EBOV originated from an independent transmission event from its natural reservoir(3) followed by sustained human-to-human infections(4). It has been reported that the EBOV genome variation might have an effect on the efficacy of sequence-based virus detection and candidate therapeutics(5,6). However, only limited viral information has been available since July 2014, when the outbreak entered a rapid growth phase(7). Here we describe 175 full-length EBOV genome sequences from five severely stricken districts in Sierra Leone from 28 September to 11 November 2014. We found that the 2014 EBOV has become more phylogenetically and genetically diverse from July to November 2014, characterized by the emergence of multiple novel lineages. The substitution rate for the 2014 EBOV was estimated to be 1.23x10(-3) substitutions per site per year (95% highest posterior density interval, 1.04x10(-3) to 1.41x10(-3) substitutions per site per year), approximating to that observed between previous EBOV outbreaks. The sharp increase in genetic diversity of the 2014 EBOV warrants extensive EBOV surveillance in Sierra Leone, Guinea and Liberia to better understand the viral evolution and transmission dynamics of the ongoing outbreak. These data will facilitate the international efforts to develop vaccines and therapeutics.","[Tong, Yi-Gang; Liang, Long; Ren, Hong-Guang; Fan, Hang; Jin, Yuan; Teng, Yue; Hu, Yi; Deng, Yong-Qiang; Sun, Yu; Wang, Zhuang; Sun, Chun-Hua; An, Xiao-Ping; Zhang, Xiang-Li-Lan; Huang, Yong; Mi, Zhi-Qiang; Yu, Dong; Yao, Hong-Wu; Lu, Bing; Jiang, Jia-Fu; Cao, Wu-Chun] State Key Lab Pathogen & Biosecur, Beijing 100071, Peoples R China; [Shi, Wei-Feng] Taishan Med Coll, Inst Pathogen Biol, Tai An 271000, Shandong, Peoples R China; [Liu, Di; Gao, George F.] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Microbiol, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Bo, Xiao-Chen; Ni, Ming; Li, Zhen; Xu, Pei-Song] Beijing Key Lab New Mol Diagnost Technol, Beijing 100850, Peoples R China; [Qian, Jun; Sun, Yang; Lu, Hui-Jun; Liu, Wen-Sen; Wang, Cheng-Yu; Bu, Zhao-Yang; Guo, Zhen-Dong; Xia, Zhi-Ping; Zheng, Xue-Xing; Yang, Song-Tao] Key Lab Jilin Prov Zoonosis Prevent & Control, Changchun 130122, Peoples R China; [Liu, Jun; Zhang, Xiao-Guang; Cao, Yu-Xi; Gao, George F.] Chinese Ctr Dis Control & Prevent, Inst Viral Dis Control & Prevent, Beijing 102206, Peoples R China; [Kargbo, David; Dafae, Foday; Kargbo, Brima] Sierra Leone Minist Hlth & Sanitat, Freetown, Sierra Leone; [Kanu, Alex] Sierra Leone China Friendship Hosp, Freetown, Sierra Leone; [Chen, Cheng-Chao; Lan, Zhi-Heng; Jiang, Hui] BGI Shenzhen, Shenzhen 518083, Peoples R China; [Luo, Yang] Wellcome Trust Sanger Inst, Cambridge CB10 1SA, England; [Yang, Fan; Su, Hao-Xiang] Chinese Acad Med Sci, Beijing 100730, Peoples R China; [Yang, Fan; Su, Hao-Xiang] Peking Union Med Coll, Beijing 100730, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Liu-Bo] Chinese Ctr Dis Control & Prevent, Inst Environm Hlth & Related Prod Safet, Beijing 100021, Peoples R China; [Nie, Wei-Min] 302 Hosp, Beijing 100039, Peoples R China; [Bai, Chang-Qing] 307 Hosp, Beijing 100071, Peoples R China; [Feng, Yong] Natl Hlth & Family Planning Commiss, Dept Int Cooperat, Beijing 100044, Peoples R China; [He, Fu-Chu] State Key Lab Prote, Beijing 102206, Peoples R China; [Gao, George F.] Chinese Ctr Dis Control & Prevent, Beijing 102206, Peoples R China","Cao, WC (reprint author), State Key Lab Pathogen & Biosecur, Beijing 100071, Peoples R China.",hefc@nic.bmi.ac.cn; gaof@im.ac.cn; caowc@bmi.ac.cn,"Liu, Di/G-6135-2014","Liu, Di/0000-0003-3693-2726","special project of Ebola virus research from the President Foundation of Chinese Academy of Sciences; China Mega-Project on Infectious Disease Prevention [2013ZX10004202-002, 2013ZX10004605]; China Mega-Project on Major Drug Development [2013ZX09304101]; National Hi-Tech Research and Development (863) Program of China [2014AA021402, 2014AA021501]; Innovative Research Group of the National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC [81321063]","We thank P.

Until now, there have been 27,013 reported cases and 11,134 deaths. The origin of the virus is thought to have been a zoonotic transmission from a bat to a two-year-old boy in December 2013 (ref. 2). From this index case the virus was spread by human-to-human contact throughout Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia. However, the origin of the particular virus in each country and time of transmission is not known and currently relies on epidemiological analysis, which may be unreliable owing to the difficulties of obtaining patient information. Here we trace the genetic evolution of EBOV in the current outbreak that has resulted in multiple lineages. Deep sequencing of 179 patient samples processed by the European Mobile Laboratory, the first diagnostics unit to be deployed to the epicentre of the outbreak in Guinea, reveals an epidemiological and evolutionary history of the epidemic from March 2014 to January 2015. Analysis of EBOV genome evolution has also benefited from a similar sequencing effort of patient samples from Sierra Leone. Our results confirm that the EBOV from Guinea moved into Sierra Leone, most likely in April or early May. The viruses of the Guinea/Sierra Leone lineage mixed around June/July 2014. Viral sequences covering August, September and October 2014 indicate that this lineage evolved independently within Guinea. These data can be used in conjunction with epidemiological information to test retrospectively the effectiveness of control measures, and provides an unprecedented window into the evolution of an ongoing viral haemorrhagic fever outbreak.","[Carroll, Miles W.; Elmore, Michael J.; Hewson, Roger; Afrough, Babak; Atkinson, Barry; Bate, Simon; Bosworth, Andrew; Clark, Simon; Jameson, Lisa; Kuisma, Eeva; Logue, Christopher H.; McCowen, James; Newman, Edmund N.

As of 29 April 2015, there have been 26,277 reported total cases (of which 14,895 have been laboratory confirmed) resulting in 10,899 deaths(1). The source of the outbreak was traced to the prefecture of Gueckedou in the forested region of southeastern Guinea(2,3). The virus later spread to the capital, Conakry, and to the neighbouring countries of Sierra Leone, Liberia, Nigeria, Senegal and Mali(1). In March 2014, when the first cases were detected in Conakry, the Institut Pasteur of Dakar, Senegal, deployed a mobile laboratory in Donka hospital to provide diagnostic services to the greater Conakry urban area and other regions of Guinea. Through this process we sampled 85 Ebola viruses (EBOV) from patients infected from July to November 2014, and report their full genome sequences here. Phylogenetic analysis reveals the sustained transmission of three distinct viral lineages co-circulating in Guinea, including the urban setting of Conakry and its surroundings. One lineage is unique to Guinea and closely related to the earliest sampled viruses of the epidemic. A second lineage contains viruses probably reintroduced from neighbouring Sierra Leone on multiple occasions, while a third lineage later spread from Guinea to Mali. Each lineage is defined by multiple mutations, including non-synonymous changes in the virion protein 35 (VP35), glycoprotein (GP) and RNA-dependent-RNA polymerase (L) proteins. The viral GP is characterized by a glycosylation site modification and mutations in the mucin-like domain that could modify the outer shape of the virion. These data illustrate the ongoing ability of EBOV to develop lineage-specific and potentially phenotypically important variation.","[Simon-Loriere, Etienne] Inst Pasteur, Funct Genet Infect Dis Unit, F-75724 Paris 15, France; [Simon-Loriere, Etienne] CNRS, URA3012, F-75015 Paris, France; [Faye, Ousmane; Faye, Oumar; Fall, Gamou; Sall, Amadou A.] Inst Pasteur, Arbovirus & Viral Hemorrhag Fever Unit, Dakar, Senegal; [Koivogui, Lamine] Inst Natl Sante Publ Guinee, Conakry, Guinea; [Magassouba, Nfaly] Univ Gamal Abdel Nasser, Projet Fievres Hemorrag Guinee, Conakry, Guinea; [Keita, Sakoba] Minist Hlth, Conakry, Guinea; [Thiberge, Jean-Michel; Diancourt, Laure; Vandenbogaert, Matthias; Caro, Valerie; Manuguerra, Jean-Claude] Inst Pasteur, Unite Environm & Risques Infect, Cellule Intervent Biol Urgence, F-75724 Paris 15, France; [Bouchier, Christiane] Inst Pasteur, Genom Platform, F-75724 Paris 15, France; [Buchmann, Jan P.; Holmes, Edward C.] Univ Sydney, Marie Bashir Inst Infect Dis & Biosecur, Charles Perkins Ctr, Sch Biol Sci, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia; [Buchmann, Jan P.; Holmes, Edward C.] Univ Sydney, Sydney Med Sch, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia; [Matranga, Christan B.; Sabeti, Pardis C.] Broad Inst, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; [Sabeti, Pardis C.] Harvard Univ, FAS Ctr Syst Biol, Dept Organism & Evolutionary Biol, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA","Simon-Loriere, E (reprint author), Inst Pasteur, Funct Genet Infect Dis Unit, F-75724 Paris 15, France.",etienne.simon-loriere@pasteur.fr; edward.holmes@sydney.edu.au; asall@pasteur.sn,,"Matranga, Christian/0000-0002-9037-5468; Holmes, Edward/0000-0001-9596-3552; Buchmann, Jan Piotr/0000-0002-6842-1229; Vandenbogaert, Mathias/0000-0002-3073-9688; , Etienne/0000-0001-8420-7743",Pasteur Ebola Task Force (PETF); French government's Investissement d'Avenir programme; Laboratoire d'Excellence 'Integrative Biology of Emerging Infectious Diseases' [ANR-10-LABX-62-IBEID]; Institut Pasteur de Dakar; NHMRC Australia fellowship,"This study was supported by the Pasteur Ebola Task Force (PETF) and has also received funding from the French government's Investissement d'Avenir programme, Laboratoire d'Excellence 'Integrative Biology of Emerging Infectious Diseases' (grant number ANR-10-LABX-62-IBEID) and Institut Pasteur de Dakar.

The physiology of nitrifiers has been intensively studied, and urea and ammonia are the only recognized energy sources that promote the aerobic growth of ammonia-oxidizing bacteria and archaea. Here we report the aerobic growth of a pure culture of the ammonia-oxidizing thaumarchaeote Nitrososphaera gargensis(1) using cyanate as the sole source of energy and reductant; to our knowledge, the first organism known to do so. Cyanate, a potentially important source of reduced nitrogen in aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems(2), is converted to ammonium and carbon dioxide in Nitrososphaera gargensis by a cyanase enzyme that is induced upon addition of this compound. Within the cyanase gene family, this cyanase is a member of a distinct clade also containing cyanases of nitrite-oxidizing bacteria of the genus Nitrospira. We demonstrate by co-culture experiments that these nitrite oxidizers supply cyanase-lacking ammonia oxidizers with ammonium from cyanate, which is fully nitrified by this microbial consortium through reciprocal feeding. By screening a comprehensive set of more than 3,000 publically available metagenomes from environmental samples, we reveal that cyanase-encoding genes clustering with the cyanases of these nitrifiers are widespread in the environment. Our results demonstrate an unexpected metabolic versatility of nitri-fying microorganisms, and suggest a previously unrecognized importance of cyanate in cycling of nitrogen compounds in the environment.","[Palatinszky, Marton; Herbold, Craig; Pogoda, Mario; Han, Ping; Lagkouvardos, Ilias; Galushko, Alexander; Koch, Hanna; Berry, David; Daims, Holger; Wagner, Michael] Univ Vienna, Dept Microbiol & Ecosyst Sci, Div Microbial Ecol, A-1090 Vienna, Austria; [Jehmlich, Nico; von Bergen, Martin] UFZ Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Dept Prote, D-04318 Leipzig, Germany; [von Bergen, Martin] UFZ Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Dept Metabol, D-04318 Leipzig, Germany; [von Bergen, Martin; Karst, Soren M.] Aalborg Univ, Dept Chem & Biosci, Fac Engn & Sci, DK-9220 Aalborg, Denmark; [Lagkouvardos, Ilias] Tech Univ Munich, ZIEL Res Ctr Nutr & Food Sci, Gregor Mendel Str 2, D-85354 Freising Weihenstephan, Germany; [Galushko, Alexander] Agrophys Res Inst, 14 Grazhdanskiy Pr, St Petersburg 195220, Russia","Wagner, M (reprint author), Univ Vienna, Dept Microbiol & Ecosyst Sci, Div Microbial Ecol, Althanstr 14, A-1090 Vienna, Austria.",wagner@microbial-ecology.net,"; Daims, Holger/I-8410-2012; Palatinszky, Marton/D-9876-2011; Jehmlich, Nico/B-5403-2009; von Bergen, Martin/D-7960-2011; Wagner, Michael/A-7801-2011; Berry, David/C-8455-2011; Galushko, Alexander/I-4980-2015; Han, Ping/F-2360-2017","Lagkouvardos, Ilias/0000-0001-9337-4033; Herbold, Craig/0000-0003-3479-0197; Daims, Holger/0000-0002-4195-0913; Palatinszky, Marton/0000-0002-3627-085X; von Bergen, Martin/0000-0003-2732-2977; Wagner, Michael/0000-0002-9778-7684; Berry, David/0000-0002-8997-608X; Galushko, Alexander/0000-0002-0387-7997; ","European Research Council [294343]; Austrian Science Fund (FWF) [P25231-B21, P26127-B20]; European Regional Development Funds (EFRE-Europe funds Saxony); Helmholtz Association; Collaborative Research Centre AquaDiva of the German Research Foundation","We thank E.

Although topologically opposite, these reactions pass through the same hemi-fusion/fission intermediate1,2, characterized by a 'stalk' in which only the outer membrane monolayers of the two compartments have merged to form a localized non-bilayer connection(1-3). Formation of the hemi-fission intermediate requires energy input from proteins catalysing membrane remodelling; however, the relationship between protein conformational rearrangements and hemi-fusion/fission remains obscure. Here we analysed how the GTPase cycle of human dynamin 1, the prototypical membrane fission catalyst(4-6), is directly coupled to membrane remodelling. We used intramolecular chemical crosslinking to stabilize dynamin in its GDP.AlF4--bound transition state. In the absence of GTP this conformer produced stable hemi-fission, but failed to progress to complete fission, even in the presence of GTP. Further analysis revealed that the pleckstrin homology domain (PHD) locked in its membrane-inserted state facilitated hemi-fission. A second mode of dynamin activity, fuelled by GTP hydrolysis, couples dynamin disassembly with cooperative diminishing of the PHD wedging, thus destabilizing the hemi-fission intermediate to complete fission. Molecular simulations corroborate the bimodal character of dynamin action and indicate radial and axial forces as dominant, although not independent, drivers of hemi-fission and fission transformations, respectively. Mirrored in the fusion reaction(7,8), the force bimodality might constitute a general paradigm for leakage-free membrane remodelling.","[Mattila, Juha-Pekka; Schmid, Sandra L.] UT Southwestern Med Ctr, Dept Cell Biol, Dallas, TX 75201 USA; [Shnyrova, Anna V.; Rodriguez Hortelano, Eva; Frolov, Vadim A.] Univ Basque Country, Biophys Unit, CSIC, Leioa 48940, Spain; [Shnyrova, Anna V.; Rodriguez Hortelano, Eva; Frolov, Vadim A.] Univ Basque Country, Dept Biochem & Mol Biol, Leioa 48940, Spain; [Sundborger, Anna C.; Hinshaw, Jenny E.] NIDDK, Lab Cell & Mol Biol, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Fuhrmans, Marc; Mueller, Marcus] Univ Gottingen, Inst Theoret Phys, D-37077 Gottingen, Germany; [Neumann, Sylvia] Scripps Res Inst, Dept Cell Biol, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; [Frolov, Vadim A.] Basque Fdn Sci, IKERBASQUE, Bilbao 48011, Spain","Schmid, SL (reprint author), UT Southwestern Med Ctr, Dept Cell Biol, Dallas, TX 75201 USA.",jennyh@helix.nih.gov; sandra.schmid@utsouthwestern.edu; vadim.frolov@ehu.eus,"Muller, Marcus/B-9898-2009","Muller, Marcus/0000-0002-7472-973X; Fuhrmans, Marc/0000-0002-9826-018X; Sundborger, Anna/0000-0003-4696-7543; Shnyrova, Anna/0000-0002-5329-348X",National Institutes of Health [R01-GM42455]; Welch Foundation [I-1823]; Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness [BFU2012-34885]; Basque Government Program Etortek [IE12-332]; European FEDER; National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases Intramural Research Program; Volkswagen foundation; Academy of Finland;  [DFG-CRC803],"We thank J.

In addition to de novo synthesis, cells recycle nucleotides from the DNA of dying cells or from cellular material ingested through the diet. Salvaged nucleosides come with the complication that they can contain epigenetic modifications. Because epigenetic inheritance of DNA methylation mainly relies on copying of the modification pattern from parental strands(1-3), random incorporation of pre-modified bases during replication could have profound implications for epigenome fidelity and yield adverse cellular phenotypes. Although the salvage mechanism of 5-methyl-2'deoxycytidine (5mdC) has been investigated before(4-6), it remains unknown how cells deal with the recently identified oxidized forms of 5mdC: 5-hydroxymethyl-2'deoxycytidine (5hmdC), 5-formy-2'deoxycytidine (5fdC) and 5-carboxyl-2'deoxycytidine (5cadC)(7-10). Here we show that enzymes of the nucleotide salvage pathway display substrate selectivity, effectively protecting newly synthesized DNA from the incorporation of epigenetically modified forms of cytosine. Thus, cell lines and animals can tolerate high doses of these modified cytidines without any deleterious effects on physiology. Notably, by screening cancer cell lines for growth defects after exposure to 5hmdC, we unexpectedly identify a subset of cell lines in which 5hmdC or 5fdC administration leads to cell lethality. Using genomic approaches, we show that the susceptible cell lines overexpress cytidine deaminase (CDA). CDA converts 5hmdC and 5fdC into variants of uridine that are incorporated into DNA, resulting in accumulation of DNA damage, and ultimately, cell death. Our observations extend current knowledge of the nucleotide salvage pathway by revealing the metabolism of oxidized epigenetic bases, and suggest a new therapeutic option for cancers, such as pancreatic cancer, that have CDA overexpression and are resistant to treatment with other cytidine analogues(11).","[Zauri, Melania; Kriaucionis, Skirmantas] Univ Oxford, Nuffield Dept Med, Ludwig Canc Res, Oxford OX3 7DQ, England; [Berridge, Georgina; Thezenas, Marie-Laetitia; Pugh, Kathryn M.; Kessler, Benedikt M.] Univ Oxford, Nuffield Dept Med, Target Discovery Inst, Oxford OX3 7FZ, England; [Pugh, Kathryn M.] Univ Oxford, Nuffield Dept Med, Struct Genom Consortium, Oxford OX3 7DQ, England; [Goldin, Robert] Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Ctr Pathol, London W2 1NY, England","Kriaucionis, S (reprint author), Univ Oxford, Nuffield Dept Med, Ludwig Canc Res, Oxford OX3 7DQ, England.",skirmantas.kriaucionis@ludwig.ox.ac.uk,,"Kessler, Benedikt/0000-0002-8160-2446",Ludwig Cancer Research; BBSRC; John Fell Fund [133/075]; Wellcome Trust [097813/Z/11/Z],"We acknowledge Ludwig Cancer Research and BBSRC for funding; R.

In all kingdoms of life it is composed of two subunits, each built on its own ribosomal RNA (rRNA) scaffold. The independent but coordinated functions of the subunits, including their ability to associate at initiation, rotate during elongation, and dissociate after protein release, are an established model of protein synthesis. Furthermore, the bipartite nature of the ribosome is presumed to be essential for biogenesis, since dedicated assembly factors keep immature ribosomal subunits apart and prevent them from translation initiation(1). Free exchange of the subunits limits the development of specialized orthogonal genetic systems that could be evolved for novel functions without interfering with native translation. Here we show that ribosomes with tethered and thus inseparable subunits (termed Ribo-T) are capable of successfully carrying out protein synthesis. By engineering a hybrid rRNA composed of both small and large subunit rRNA sequences, we produced a functional ribosome in which the subunits are covalently linked into a single entity by short RNA linkers. Notably, Ribo-T was not only functional in vitro, but was also able to support the growth of Escherichia coli cells even in the absence of wild-type ribosomes. We used Ribo-T to create the first fully orthogonal ribosome-messenger RNA system, and demonstrate its evolvability by selecting otherwise dominantly lethal rRNA mutations in the peptidyl transferase centre that facilitate the translation of a problematic protein sequence. Ribo-T can be used for exploring poorly understood functions of the ribosome, enabling orthogonal genetic systems, and engineering ribosomes with new functions.","[Orelle, Cedric; Szal, Teresa; Florin, Tanja; Mankin, Alexander S.] Univ Illinois, Ctr Pharmaceut Biotechnol MC 870, Chicago, IL 60607 USA; [Carlson, Erik D.; Jewett, Michael C.] Northwestern Univ, Dept Chem & Biol Engn, Evanston, IL 60208 USA; [Carlson, Erik D.; Jewett, Michael C.] Northwestern Univ, Chem Life Proc Inst, Evanston, IL 60208 USA","Mankin, AS (reprint author), Univ Illinois, Ctr Pharmaceut Biotechnol MC 870, 900 South Ashland Ave, Chicago, IL 60607 USA.",m-jewett@northwestern.edu; shura@uic.edu,"Jewett, Michael/E-3506-2010",,"Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency [N66001-12-C-4211]; National Science Foundation [MCB-0943393, MCB-1244455]; David and Lucille Packard Foundation [2011-37152]","We thank I.

Here we resolve these inconsistencies and show that large eruptions in the tropics and high latitudes were primary drivers of interannual-to-decadal temperature variability in the Northern Hemisphere during the past 2,500 years. Our results are based on new records of atmospheric aerosol loading developed from high-resolution, multi-parameter measurements from an array of Greenland and Antarctic ice cores as well as distinctive age markers to constrain chronologies. Overall, cooling was proportional to the magnitude of volcanic forcing and persisted for up to ten years after some of the largest eruptive episodes. Our revised timescale more firmly implicates volcanic eruptions as catalysts in the major sixth-century pandemics, famines, and socioeconomic disruptions in Eurasia and Mesoamerica while allowing multi-millennium quantification of climate response to volcanic forcing.","[Sigl, M.; McConnell, J.

It remains unclear how these opposing interactions are resolved at the population level. Here we investigate such an internal conflict within a microbial (Bacillus subtilis) biofilm community: cells in the biofilm periphery not only protect interior cells from external attack but also starve them through nutrient consumption. We discover that this conflict between protection and starvation is resolved through emergence of long-range metabolic co-dependence between peripheral and interior cells. As a result, biofilm growth halts periodically, increasing nutrient availability for the sheltered interior cells. We show that this collective oscillation in biofilm growth benefits the community in the event of a chemical attack. These findings indicate that oscillations support population-level conflict resolution by coordinating competing metabolic demands in space and time, suggesting new strategies to control biofilm growth.","[Liu, Jintao; Prindle, Arthur; Humphries, Jacqueline; Lee, Dong-Yeon D.; Ly, San; Sueel, Guerol M.] Univ Calif San Diego, Div Biol Sci, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Gabalda-Sagarra, Marcal; Garcia-Ojalvo, Jordi] Univ Pompeu Fabra, Dept Expt & Hlth Sci, Barcelona 08003, Spain; [Asally, Munehiro] Univ Warwick, Sch Life Sci, Warwick Integrat Synthet Biol Ctr, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England; [Asally, Munehiro] Univ Warwick, Sch Life Sci, Warwick Integrat Synthet Biol Ctr, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England","Suel, GM (reprint author), Univ Calif San Diego, Div Biol Sci, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.",gsuel@ucsd.edu,,"Garcia-Ojalvo, Jordi/0000-0002-3716-7520; Liu, Jintao/0000-0002-6710-2605; Gabalda-Sagarra, Marcal/0000-0002-3933-2577","UCSD Cell and Molecular Genetics Training Grant; Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad (Spain) [FIS2012-37655-C02-01]; FEDER [FIS2012-37655-C02-01]; ICREA Academia Programme; National Institutes of Health, National Institute of General Medical Sciences [R01 GM088428]; National Science Foundation [MCB-1450867]","We would like to thank K.

The bacterial type VI secretion system is one of the key players in microbial competition, as well as being an important virulence determinant during bacterial infections. It assembles a nano-crossbow-like structure in the cytoplasm of the attacker cell that propels an arrow made of a haemolysin co-regulated protein (Hcp) tube and a valine-glycine repeat protein G (VgrG) spike and punctures the prey's cell wall. The nano-crossbow is stably anchored to the cell envelope of the attacker by a membrane core complex. Here we show that this complex is assembled by the sequential addition of three type VI subunits (Tss) - TssJ, TssM and TssL-and present a structure of the fully assembled complex at 11.6 angstrom resolution, determined by negative-stain electron microscopy. With overall C-5 symmetry, this 1.7-megadalton complex comprises a large base in the cytoplasm. It extends in the periplasm via ten arches to form a double-ring structure containing the carboxy-terminal domain of TssM (TssM(ct)) and TssJ that is anchored in the outer membrane. The crystal structure of the TssM(ct)-TssJ complex coupled to whole-cell accessibility studies suggest that large conformational changes induce transient pore formation in the outer membrane, allowing passage of the attacking Hcp tube/VgrG spike.","[Durand, Eric; Zoued, Abdelrahim; Logger, Laureen; Aschtgen, Marie-Stephanie] Aix Marseille Univ, CNRS, UMR 7255, Lab Ingn Syst Macromol, F-13402 Marseille 20, France; [Durand, Eric; Van Son Nguyen; Spinelli, Silvia; Desmyter, Aline; Roussel, Alain; Cambillau, Christian] CNRS, UMR 7257, Architecture & Fonct Macromol Biol, F-13288 Marseille 09, France; [Durand, Eric; Dujeancourt, Annick; Fronzes, Remi] Inst Pasteur, Biol Struct Secret Bacterienne G5, F-75015 Paris, France; [Durand, Eric] CNRS, UMR3528, Inst Pasteur, F-75015 Paris, France; [Durand, Eric; Van Son Nguyen; Spinelli, Silvia; Desmyter, Aline; Roussel, Alain; Cambillau, Christian] Aix Marseille Univ, AFMB, IHU Mediterrane Infect, F-13288 Marseille 09, France; [Bardiaux, Benjamin] Inst Pasteur, Unite Bioinformat Struct, F-75015 Paris, France","Cambillau, C (reprint author), CNRS, UMR 7257, Architecture & Fonct Macromol Biol, Campus Luminy,Case 932, F-13288 Marseille 09, France.",cambillau@afmb.univ-mrs.fr; cascales@imm.cnrs.fr; remi.fronzes@pasteur.fr,"Durand, Eric/E-6739-2017","Durand, Eric/0000-0002-0577-8220; aschtgen, marie-stephanie/0000-0003-2413-8226; Bardiaux, Benjamin/0000-0003-4014-9195; Fronzes, Remi/0000-0003-3031-9824","Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR) [ANR-10-JCJC-1303-03, ANR-14-CE14-0006-02]; French Infrastructure for Integrated Structural Biology (FRISBI) [ANR-10-INSB-05-01]; Fondation pour la Recherche Medicale [SPF20101221116]; ANR [ANR-10-JCJC-1303-03, Bip:Bip]; French Embassy in Vietnam [792803C]; French Ministere de la Recherche; Fondation pour la Recherche Medicale fellowship [FDT20140931060]","This work was funded by Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR) grants ANR-10-JCJC-1303-03 to E.C., Bip:Bip to R.F., ANR-14-CE14-0006-02 to C.C. and E.C., and supported by the French Infrastructure for Integrated Structural Biology (FRISBI) ANR-10-INSB-05-01.

Arrestin binding to GPCRs blocks G protein interaction and redirects signalling to numerous G-protein-independent pathways. Here we report the crystal structure of a constitutively active form of human rhodopsin bound to a pre-activated form of the mouse visual arrestin, determined by serial femtosecond X-ray laser crystallography. Together with extensive biochemical and mutagenesis data, the structure reveals an overall architecture of the rhodopsin-arrestin assembly in which rhodopsin uses distinct structural elements, including transmembrane helix 7 and helix 8, to recruit arrestin. Correspondingly, arrestin adopts the pre-activated conformation, with a similar to 20 degrees rotation between the amino and carboxy domains, which opens up a cleft in arrestin to accommodate a short helix formed by the second intracellular loop of rhodopsin. This structure provides a basis for understanding GPCR-mediated arrestin-biased signalling and demonstrates the power of X-ray lasers for advancing the frontiers of structural biology.","[Kang, Yanyong; Zhou, X.

They are powered by magnetospheric current systems that lead to the precipitation of energetic electrons into the high-latitude regions of the upper atmosphere. In the case of the gas-giant planets, these aurorae include highly polarized radio emission at kilohertz and megahertz frequencies produced by the precipitating electrons(2), as well as continuum and line emission in the infrared, optical, ultraviolet and X-ray parts of the spectrum, associated with the collisional excitation and heating of the hydrogen-dominated atmosphere(3). Here we report simultaneous radio and optical spectroscopic observations of an object at the end of the stellar main sequence, located right at the boundary between stars and brown dwarfs, from which we have detected radio and optical auroral emissions both powered by magnetospheric currents. Whereas the magnetic activity of stars like our Sun is powered by processes that occur in their lower atmospheres, these aurorae are powered by processes originating much further out in the magnetosphere of the dwarf star that couple energy into the lower atmosphere. The dissipated power is at least four orders of magnitude larger than what is produced in the Jovian magnetosphere, revealing aurorae to be a potentially ubiquitous signature of large-scale magnetospheres that can scale to luminosities far greater than those observed in our Solar System. These magnetospheric current systems may also play a part in powering some of the weather phenomena reported on brown dwarfs.","[Hallinan, G.; Bourke, S.; Pineda, J. S.; Kao, M.

Strong light waves can control and recollide electronic wavepackets, generating high-harmonic radiation that encodes the structure and dynamics of atoms and molecules and lays the foundations of attosecond science(1-3). The recent discovery of high-harmonic generation in bulk solids(4-6) combines the idea of ultrafast acceleration with complex condensed matter systems, and provides hope for compact solid-state attosecond sources(6-8) and electronics at optical frequencies(3,5,9,10). Yet the underlying quantum motion has not so far been observable in real time. Here we study high-harmonic generation in a bulk solid directly in the time domain, and reveal a new kind of strong-field excitation in the crystal. Unlike established atomic sources(1-3,9,11), our solid emits high-harmonic radiation as a sequence of subcycle bursts that coincide temporally with the field crests of one polarity of the driving terahertz waveform. We show that these features are characteristic of a non-perturbative quantum interference process that involves electrons from multiple valence bands. These results identify key mechanisms for future solid-state attosecond sources and next-generation light-wave electronics. The new quantum interference process justifies the hope for all-optical band-structure reconstruction and lays the foundation for possible quantum logic operations at optical clock rates.","[Hohenleutner, M.; Langer, F.; Schubert, O.; Knorr, M.; Huber, R.] Univ Regensburg, Dept Phys, D-93040 Regensburg, Germany; [Huttner, U.; Koch, S.

Compared to their ceramic counterparts, polymer dielectrics have higher breakdown strengths and greater reliability(1-3,9), are scalable, lightweight and can be shaped into intricate configurations, and are therefore an ideal choice for many power electronics, power conditioning, and pulsed power applications(1,9,10). However, polymer dielectrics are limited to relatively low working temperatures, and thus fail to meet the rising demand for electricity under the extreme conditions present in applications such as hybrid and electric vehicles, aerospace power electronics, and underground oil and gas exploration(11-13). Here we describe crosslinked polymer nanocomposites that contain boron nitride nanosheets, the dielectric properties of which are stable over a broad temperature and frequency range. The nanocomposites have outstanding high-voltage capacitive energy storage capabilities at record temperatures (a Weibull breakdown strength of 403 megavolts per metre and a discharged energy density of 1.8 joules per cubic centimetre at 250 degrees Celsius). Their electrical conduction is several orders of magnitude lower than that of existing polymers and their high operating temperatures are attributed to greatly improved thermal conductivity, owing to the presence of the boron nitride nanosheets, which improve heat dissipation compared to pristine polymers (which are inherently susceptible to thermal runaway). Moreover, the polymer nanocomposites are lightweight, photopatternable and mechanically flexible, and have been demonstrated to preserve excellent dielectric and capacitive performance after intensive bending cycles. These findings enable broader applications of organic materials in high-temperature electronics and energy storage devices.","[Li, Qi; Chen, Lei; Gadinski, Matthew R.; Zhang, Guangzu; Chen, Long-Qing; Wang, Qing] Penn State Univ, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Zhang, Shihai] PolyK Technol, State Coll, PA 16802 USA; [Li, Haoyu; Jackson, Thomas N.] Penn State Univ, Dept Elect Engn, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Haque, Aman] Penn State Univ, Dept Mech & Nucl Engn, University Pk, PA 16802 USA","Wang, Q (reprint author), Penn State Univ, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, University Pk, PA 16802 USA.",wang@matse.psu.edu,"Chen, LongQing/I-7536-2012","Chen, LongQing/0000-0003-3359-3781",US Office of Naval Research [N00014-11-1-0342]; Air Force Office of Scientific Research [FA9550-14-1-0264]; Dow Chemical Corporation,Q.W. acknowledges financial support from the US Office of Naval Research under grant number N00014-11-1-0342.

The eastward-flowing ACC occupies a unique circumglobal pathway in the Southern Ocean that was enabled by the tectonic opening of key oceanic gateways during the break-up of Gondwana (for example, by the opening of the Tasmanian Gateway, which connects the Indian and Pacific oceans). Although the ACC is a key component of Earth's present and past climate system(1), the timing of the appearance of diagnostic features of the ACC (for example, low zonal gradients in water-mass tracer fields(4-7)) is poorly known and represents a fundamental gap in our understanding of Earth history. Here we show, using geophysically determined positions of continent-ocean boundaries(8), that the deep Tasmanian Gateway opened 33.5+/-1.5 million years ago (the errors indicate uncertainty in the boundary positions). Following this opening, sediments from Indian and Pacific cores recorded Pacific-type neodymium isotope ratios, revealing deep westward flow equivalent to the present-day Antarctic Slope Current. We observe onset of the ACC at around 30 million years ago, when Southern Ocean neodymium isotopes record a permanent shift to modern Indian-Atlantic ratios. Our reconstructions of ocean circulation show that massive reorganization and homogenization of Southern Ocean water masses coincided with migration of the northern margin of the Tasmanian Gateway into the mid-latitude westerly wind band, which we reconstruct at 64 degrees S, near to the northern margin. Onset of the ACC about 30 million years ago coincided with major changes in global ocean circulation(9) and probably contributed to the lower atmospheric carbon dioxide levels that appear after this time(10).","[Scher, Howie D.] Univ S Carolina, Dept Earth & Ocean Sci, Columbia, SC 29208 USA; [Whittaker, Joanne M.] Univ Tasmania, Inst Marine & Antarctic Studies, Hobart, Tas 7001, Australia; [Williams, Simon E.] Univ Sydney, Sch Geosci, EarthByte Grp, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia; [Latimer, Jennifer C.] Indiana State Univ, Dept Earth & Environm Syst, Terre Haute, IN 47809 USA; [Kordesch, Wendy E.

This is due to conflicting character evidence from molecules and morphology and a lack of transitional fossils from the critical time interval. The similar to 220-million-year-old stem-turtle Odontochelys from China(12) has a partly formed shell and many turtle-like features in its post-cranial skeleton. Unlike the 214-million-year-old Proganochelys from Germany and Thailand, it retains marginal teeth and lacks a carapace. Odontochelys is separated by a large temporal gap from the similar to 260-million-year-old Eunotosaurus from South Africa, which has been hypothesized as the earliest stem-turtle(4,5). Here we report a new reptile, Pappochelys, that is structurally and chronologically intermediate between Eunotosaurus and Odontochelys and dates from the Middle Triassic period (similar to 240 million years ago). The three taxa share anteroposteriorly broad trunk ribs that are T-shaped in cross-section and bear sculpturing, elongate dorsal vertebrae, and modified limb girdles. Pappochelys closely resembles Odontochelys in various features of the limb girdles. Unlike Odontochelys, it has a cuirass of robust paired gastralia in place of a plastron. Pappochelys provides new evidence that the plastron partly formed through serial fusion of gastralia(3,13). Its skull has small upper and ventrally open lower temporal fenestrae, supporting the hypothesis of diapsid affinities of turtles(2,7-10,14,15).","[Schoch, Rainer R.] Staatliches Museum Nat Kunde Stuttgart, D-70191 Stuttgart, Germany; [Sues, Hans-Dieter] Natl Museum Nat Hist, Dept Paleobiol, Washington, DC 20013 USA","Schoch, RR (reprint author), Staatliches Museum Nat Kunde Stuttgart, Rosenstein 1, D-70191 Stuttgart, Germany.",rainer.schoch@smns-bw.de; suesh@si.edu,,,,,,25,30,30,8,105,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,30-Jul,2015,523,7562,,,,,584,+,,10.1038/nature14472,,11,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,CN7ZL,WOS:000358655200043,26106865,No,Y,N,11/19/17

To date, no robustly replicated genetic loci have been identified(2), despite analysis of more than 9,000 cases(3). Here, using low-coverage whole-genome sequencing of 5,303 Chinese women with recurrent MDD selected to reduce phenotypic heterogeneity, and 5,337 controls screened to exclude MDD, we identified, and subsequently replicated in an independent sample, two loci contributing to risk of MDD on chromosome 10: one near the SIRT1 gene (P = 2.53 x 10(-10)), the other in an intron of the LHPP gene (P = 6.45 x10(-12)). Analysis of 4,509 cases with a severe subtype of MDD, melancholia, yielded an increased genetic signal at the SIRT1 locus. We attribute our success to the recruitment of relatively homogeneous cases with severe illness.","[Cai, Na; Kretzschmar, Warren; Li, Yihan; Fu, Guangyi; Marchini, Jonathan; Mott, Richard; Flint, Jonathan] Univ Oxford, Wellcome Trust Ctr Human Genet, Oxford OX3 7BN, England;

Although neuroscientists widely believe that neural synapses are elemental sites of information storage(3), there has been no direct evidence that hippocampal synapses persist for time intervals commensurate with the duration of hippocampal-dependent memory. Here we tested the prediction that the lifetimes of hippocampal synapses match the longevity of hippocampal memory. By using time-lapse two-photon microendoscopy(4) in the CA1 hippocampal area of live mice, we monitored the turnover dynamics of the pyramidal neurons' basal dendritic spines, postsynaptic structures whose turnover dynamics are thought to reflect those of excitatory synaptic connections(5,6). Strikingly, CA1 spine turnover dynamics differed sharply from those seen previously in the neocortex(7-9). Mathematical modelling revealed that the data best matched kinetic models with a single population of spines with a mean lifetime of approximately 1-2 weeks. This implies similar to 100% turnover in similar to 2-3 times this interval, a near full erasure of the synaptic connectivity pattern. Although N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor blockade stabilizes spines in the neocortex(10,11), in CA1 it transiently increased the rate of spine loss and thus lowered spine density. These results reveal that adult neocortical and hippocampal pyramidal neurons have divergent patterns of spine regulation and quantitatively support the idea that the transience of hippocampal-dependent memory directly reflects the turnover dynamics of hippocampal synapses.","[Attardo, Alessio; Fitzgerald, James E.; Schnitzer, Mark J.] Stanford Univ, James H Clark Ctr Biomed Engn & Sci, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Attardo, Alessio; Schnitzer, Mark J.] Stanford Univ, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Schnitzer, Mark J.] Stanford Univ, CNC Program, Stanford, CA 94305 USA","Schnitzer, MJ (reprint author), Stanford Univ, James H Clark Ctr Biomed Engn & Sci, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",mschnitz@stanford.edu,"Fitzgerald, James/E-6569-2012","Fitzgerald, James/0000-0002-0949-4188","National Institute of Mental Health; National Institute on Aging; Ellison Foundation; National Science Foundation; Stanford Center for Mind, Brain, and Computation","We thank J.

Stem cell niches provide signals that promote stem cell maintenance(1,2), while differentiated daughter cells are known to provide feedback signals to regulate stem cell replication and differentiation(3-6). Recently, stem cells have been shown to regulate themselves using an autocrine mechanism(7). The existence of a 'stem cell niche' was first postulated by Schofield in 1978 to define local environments necessary for the maintenance of haematopoietic stem cells1. Since then, an increasing body of work has focused on defining stem cell niches(1-6). Yet little is known about how progenitor cell and differentiated cell numbers and proportions are maintained. In the airway epithelium, basal cells function as stem/progenitor cells that can both self-renew and produce differentiated secretory cells and ciliated cells(8,9). Secretory cells also act as transit-amplifying cells that eventually differentiate into post-mitotic ciliated cells(9,10). Here we describe a mode of cell regulation in which adult mammalian stem/progenitor cells relay a forward signal to their own progeny. Surprisingly, this forward signal is shown to be necessary for daughter cell maintenance. Using a combination of cell ablation, lineage tracing and signalling pathway modulation, we show that airway basal stem/progenitor cells continuously supply a Notch ligand to their daughter secretory cells. Without these forward signals, the secretory progenitor cell pool fails to be maintained and secretory cells execute a terminal differentiation program and convert into ciliated cells. Thus, a parent stem/progenitor cell can serve as a functional daughter cell niche.","[Pardo-Saganta, Ana; Tata, Purushothama Rao; Law, Brandon M.; Saez, Borja; Chow, Ryan Dz-Wei; Prabhu, Mythili; Rajagopal, Jayaraj] Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Ctr Regenerat Med, Boston, MA 02114 USA; [Pardo-Saganta, Ana; Tata, Purushothama Rao; Law, Brandon M.; Chow, Ryan Dz-Wei; Prabhu, Mythili; Rajagopal, Jayaraj] Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Dept Internal Med, Boston, MA 02114 USA; [Pardo-Saganta, Ana; Tata, Purushothama Rao; Law, Brandon M.; Chow, Ryan Dz-Wei; Prabhu, Mythili; Rajagopal, Jayaraj] Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Dept Pediat, Pulm & Crit Care Unit, Boston, MA 02114 USA; [Pardo-Saganta, Ana; Tata, Purushothama Rao; Law, Brandon M.; Saez, Borja; Chow, Ryan Dz-Wei; Prabhu, Mythili; Rajagopal, Jayaraj] Harvard Stem Cell Inst, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Saez, Borja] Harvard Univ, Stem Cell & Regenerat Biol Dept, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Gridley, Thomas] Maine Med Ctr, Res Inst, Ctr Mol Med, Scarborough, ME 04074 USA","Rajagopal, J (reprint author), Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Ctr Regenerat Med, 185 Cambridge St, Boston, MA 02114 USA.",jrajagopal@mgh.harvard.edu,,"Chow, Ryan/0000-0002-1872-6307","New York Stem Cell Foundation; National Institutes of Health-National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute Early Career Research New Faculty (P30) award [5P30HL101287-02]; NIH-NHLBI [RO1HL118185]; Harvard Stem Cell Institute (HSCI) Junior Investigator Grant","We thank A.

Rice paddies are the largest anthropogenic methane source and produce 7-17% of atmospheric methane(2,3). Warm waterlogged soil and exuded nutrients from rice roots provide ideal conditions for methanogenesis in paddies with annual methane emissions of 25-100-million tonnes(3,4). This scenario will be exacerbated by an expansion in rice cultivation needed to meet the escalating demand for food in the coming decades(4). There is an urgent need to establish sustainable technologies for increasing rice production while reducing methane fluxes from rice paddies. However, ongoing efforts for methane mitigation in rice paddies are mainly based on farming practices and measures that are difficult to implement(5). Despite proposed strategies to increase rice productivity and reduce methane emissions(4,6), no high-starch low-methane-emission rice has been developed. Here we show that the addition of a single transcription factor gene, barley SUSIBA2 (refs 7, 8), conferred a shift of carbon flux to SUSIBA2 rice, favouring the allocation of photo-synthates to aboveground biomass over allocation to roots. The altered allocation resulted in an increased biomass and starch content in the seeds and stems, and suppressed methanogenesis, possibly through a reduction in root exudates. Three-year field trials in China demonstrated that the cultivation of SUSIBA2 rice was associated with a significant reduction in methane emissions and a decrease in rhizospheric methanogen levels. SUSIBA2 rice offers a sustainable means of providing increased starch content for food production while reducing greenhouse gas emissions from rice cultivation. Approaches to increase rice productivity and reduce methane emissions as seen in SUSIBA2 rice may be particularly beneficial in a future climate with rising temperatures resulting in increased methane emissions from paddies(9,10).","[Su, J.; Hu, C.; Chen, Z.; Guan, Q.; Wang, Y.; Zhong, D.; Wang, F.] Fujian Acad Agr Sci, Inst Biotechnol, Fuzhou 350003, Peoples R China; [Su, J.; Hu, C.; Yan, X.; Jin, Y.; Sun, C.] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Linnean Ctr Plant Biol, Uppsala BioCtr, Dept Plant Biol, SE-75007 Uppsala, Sweden; [Jin, Y.] Hunan Agr Univ, Hunan Prov Key Lab Crop Germplasm Innovat & Utili, Changsha 410128, Hunan, Peoples R China; [Jansson, C.] Pacific NW Natl Lab, Environm Mol Sci Lab EMSL, Richland, WA 99352 USA; [Schnurer, A.] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Microbiol, Uppsala BioCtr, SE-75007 Uppsala, Sweden","Sun, C (reprint author), Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Linnean Ctr Plant Biol, Uppsala BioCtr, Dept Plant Biol, POB 7080, SE-75007 Uppsala, Sweden.",wf@fjage.org; Chuanxin.Sun@slu.se,,,"Swedish Research Council for Environment, Agricultural Sciences and Spatial Planning (Formas) [219-2014-1172]; Formas/Sida [220-2009-2069]; SLU Larosatesansokan Programme (TC4F) for Team 4 - Vinnova; Swedish Research Council for Environment, Agricultural Sciences and Spatial Planning (Formas) under the Strategic Research Area for the TCBB Programme; National Natural Science Foundation of China [30771298, 31370389]; SLU programme BarleyFunFood; Carl Trygger Foundation [CTS 11: 450]; US Department of Energy [DE-AC05-76RL01830]; Pacific Northwest National Laboratory","Special thanks to S.

Any disruption of intra-or inter-protein interactions will alter this delicate structure, exposing hydrophobic surfaces, with consequent protein aggregation and cataract formation. Cataracts are the most common cause of blindness worldwide, affecting tens of millions of people(1), and currently the only treatment is surgical removal of cataractous lenses. The precise mechanisms by which lens proteins both prevent aggregation and maintain lens transparency are largely unknown. Lanosterol is an amphipathic molecule enriched in the lens. It is synthesized by lanosterol synthase (LSS) in a key cyclization reaction of a cholesterol synthesis pathway. Here we identify two distinct homozygous LSS missense mutations (W581R and G588S) in two families with extensive congenital cataracts. Both of these mutations affect highly conserved amino acid residues and impair key catalytic functions of LSS. Engineered expression of wild-type, but not mutant, LSS prevents intracellular protein aggregation of various cataract-causing mutant crystallins. Treatment by lanosterol, but not cholesterol, significantly decreased preformed protein aggregates both in vitro and in cell-transfection experiments. We further show that lanosterol treatment could reduce cataract severity and increase transparency in dissected rabbit cataractous lenses in vitro and cataract severity in vivo in dogs. Our study identifies lanosterol as a key molecule in the prevention of lens protein aggregation and points to a novel strategy for cataract prevention and treatment.","[Zhao, Ling; Cai, Huimin; Li, Gen; Cao, Guiqun; Hu, Xun; Su, Zhiguang; Zhang, Kang] Sichuan Univ, Mol Med Res Ctr, State Key Lab Biotherapy, West China Hosp, Chengdu 610041, Peoples R China; [Zhao, Ling; Ouyang, Hong; Lin, Ying; Wang, Yandong; Liu, Yizhi; Zhang, Kang] Sun Yat Sen Univ, State Key Lab Ophthalmol, Zhongshan Ophthalm Ctr, Guangzhou 510060, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Zhao, Ling; Zhu, Jie; Ouyang, Hong; Patel, Sherrina H.; Lin, Danni; Wu, Frances; Flagg, Ken; Lin, Ying; Chen, Daniel; Wen, Cindy; Chung, Christopher; Qiu, Austin; Yeh, Emily; Wang, Wenqiu; Grob, Seanna; Luo, Hongrong; Gao, Weiwei; Granet, David; Zhang, Liangfang; Zhang, Kang] Univ Calif San Diego, Inst Engn Med, Dept Ophthalmol, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Zhao, Ling; Zhu, Jie; Ouyang, Hong; Patel, Sherrina H.; Lin, Danni; Wu, Frances; Flagg, Ken; Lin, Ying; Chen, Daniel; Wen, Cindy; Chung, Christopher; Qiu, Austin; Yeh, Emily; Wang, Wenqiu; Grob, Seanna; Luo, Hongrong; Gao, Weiwei; Granet, David; Zhang, Liangfang; Zhang, Kang] Univ Calif San Diego, Inst Engn Med, Biomat & Tissue Engn Ctr, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Chen, Xiang-Jun; Xi, Yi-Bo; Hu, Li-Dan; Tjondro, Harry Christianto; Zhao, Xi-Juan] Tsinghua Univ, Sch Life Sci, State Key Lab Membrane Biol, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China; [Zhu, Jie; Yan, Yong-Bin] Fourth Mil Med Univ, Xijing Hosp, Dept Ophthalmol, Xian 710032, Peoples R China; [Yang, Xu; Jin, Xin; Li, Yingrui; Wang, Jun] BGI Shenzhen, Shenzhen 518083, Peoples R China; [Cai, Huimin; Hou, Rui] Guangzhou KangRui Biol Pharmaceut Technol Co, Guangzhou 510005, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Qiu, Austin] CapitalBio Genom Co Ltd, Dongguan 523808, Peoples R China; [Wang, Wenqiu; Sun, Xiaodong] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Med, Shanghai Peoples Hosp 1, Dept Ophthalmol, Shanghai 20080, Peoples R China; [Abagyan, Ruben] Univ Calif San Diego, Skaggs Sch Pharm & Pharmaceut Sci, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Perry, J.

An understanding of the molecular basis for this heterogeneity could lead to significant improvements in both monitoring and treatment. During chronic infection the process of T-cell exhaustion inhibits the immune response, facilitating viral persistence(1). Here we show that a transcriptional signature reflecting CD8 T-cell exhaustion is associated with poor clearance of chronic viral infection, but conversely predicts better prognosis in multiple autoimmune diseases. The development of CD8 T-cell exhaustion during chronic infection is driven both by persistence of antigen and by a lack of accessory 'help' signals. In autoimmunity, we find that where evidence of CD4 T-cell co-stimulation is pronounced, that of CD8 T-cell exhaustion is reduced. We can reproduce the exhaustion signature by modifying the balance of persistent stimulation of T-cell antigen receptors and specific CD2-induced co-stimulation provided to human CD8 T cells in vitro, suggesting that each process plays a role in dictating outcome in autoimmune disease. The 'non-exhausted' T-cell state driven by CD2-induced co-stimulation is reduced by signals through the exhaustion-associated inhibitory receptor PD-1, suggesting that induction of exhaustion may be a therapeutic strategy in autoimmune and inflammatory disease. Using expression of optimal surrogate markers of co-stimulation/exhaustion signatures in independent data sets, we confirm an association with good clinical outcome or response to therapy in infection (hepatitis C virus) and vaccination (yellow fever, malaria, influenza), but poor outcome in autoimmune and inflammatory disease (type 1 diabetes, anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-associated vasculitis, systemic lupus erythematosus, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and dengue haemorrhagic fever). Thus, T-cell exhaustion plays a central role in determining outcome in autoimmune disease and targeted manipulation of this process could lead to new therapeutic opportunities.","[McKinney, Eoin F.; Lee, James C.; Jayne, David R.

We hypothesized that mitochondrial structure minimizes metabolite diffusion distances in skeletal muscle. Here we demonstrate a mitochondrial reticulum providing a conductive pathway for energy distribution, in the form of the proton-motive force, throughout the mouse skeletal muscle cell. Within this reticulum, we find proteins associated with mitochondrial proton-motive force production preferentially in the cell periphery and proteins that use the proton-motive force for ATP production in the cell interior near contractile and transport ATPases. Furthermore, we show a rapid, coordinated depolarization of the membrane potential component of the proton-motive force throughout the cell in response to spatially controlled uncoupling of the cell interior. We propose that membrane potential conduction via the mitochondrial reticulum is the dominant pathway for skeletal muscle energy distribution.","[Glancy, Brian; Malide, Daniela; Yu, Zu-Xi; Combs, Christian A.; Connelly, Patricia S.; Balaban, Robert S.] NHLBI, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Hartnell, Lisa M.; Subramaniam, Sriram] NCI, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA","Balaban, RS (reprint author), NHLBI, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA.",Robert.Balaban@nih.gov,"Glancy, Brian/P-3163-2016","Glancy, Brian/0000-0002-8571-244X","Division of Intramural Research, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute; Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute","We would like to thank E.

TET enzymes successively convert 5mC to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC), 5-formylcytosine (5fC), and 5-carboxylcytosine (5caC), with 5fC and 5caC subject to removal by thymine DNA glycosylase (TDG) in conjunction with base excision repair(1-6). Early reports indicate that 5fC and 5caC could be stably detected on enhancers, promoters and gene bodies, with distinct effects on gene expression, but the mechanisms have remained elusive(7,8). Here we determined the X-ray crystal structure of yeast elongating RNA polymerase II (Pol II) in complex with a DNA template containing oxidized 5mCs, revealing specific hydrogen bonds between the 5-carboxyl group of 5caC and the conserved epi-DNA recognition loop in the polymerase. This causes a positional shift for incoming nucleoside 5'-triphosphate (NTP), thus compromising nucleotide addition. To test the implication of this structural insight in vivo, we determined the global effect of increased 5fC/5caC levels on transcription, finding that such DNA modifications indeed retarded Pol II elongation on gene bodies. These results demonstrate the functional impact of oxidized 5mCs on gene expression and suggest a novel role for Pol II as a specific and direct epigenetic sensor during transcription elongation.","[Wang, Lanfeng; Xu, Liang; Chong, Jenny; Wang, Dong] Univ Calif San Diego, Skaggs Sch Pharm & Pharmaceut Sci, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Zhou, Yu; Xiao, Rui; Chen, Liang; Li, Hairi; Fu, Xiang-Dong] Univ Calif San Diego, Sch Med, Dept Cellular & Mol Med, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Lu, Xingyu; He, Chuan] Univ Chicago, Dept Chem, Dept Biochem & Mol Biol, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Lu, Xingyu; He, Chuan] Univ Chicago, Inst Biophys Dynam, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Chicago, IL 60637 USA","Wang, D (reprint author), Univ Calif San Diego, Skaggs Sch Pharm & Pharmaceut Sci, 9500 Gilman Dr, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.",xdfu@ucsd.edu; dongwang@ucsd.edu,,,"National Institutes of Health (NIH) [GM102362]; Kimmel Scholars award from the Sidney Kimmel Foundation for Cancer Research; Skaggs School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of California, San Diego; NIH [HG006827, GM052872, HG004659]; Howard Hughes Medical Institute","D.W. acknowledges the National Institutes of Health (NIH) (GM102362), a Kimmel Scholars award from the Sidney Kimmel Foundation for Cancer Research, and start-up funds from the Skaggs School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of California, San Diego.

For this translation to occur, grid cells must have continuous access to information about instantaneous running speed. However, a powerful entorhinal speed signal has not been identified. Here we show that running speed is represented in the firing rate of a ubiquitous but functionally dedicated population of entorhinal neurons distinct from other cell populations of the local circuit, such as grid, head-direction and border cells. These 'speed cells' are characterized by a context-invariant positive, linear response to running speed, and share with grid cells a prospective bias of 50-80ms.

Among the various protein-translocation machineries, the peptidase-containing ATP-binding cassette transporters (PCATs) are appealingly simple. Each PCAT contains two peptidase domains that cleave the secretion signal from the substrate, two transmembrane domains that form a translocation pathway, and two nucleotide-binding domains that hydrolyse ATP. In Gram-positive bacteria, PCATs function both as maturation proteases and exporters for quorum-sensing or antimicrobial polypeptides. In Gram-negative bacteria, PCATs interact with two other membrane proteins to form the type 1 secretion system. Here we present crystal structures of PCAT1 from Clostridium thermocellum in two different conformations.

However, tauopathy has not been detected in the early stages after TBI, and how TBI leads to tauopathy is unknown. Here we find robust cis P-tau pathology after TBI in humans and mice. After TBI in mice and stress in vitro, neurons acutely produce cis P-tau, which disrupts axonal microtubule networks and mitochondrial transport, spreads to other neurons, and leads to apoptosis. This process, which we term 'cistauosis', appears long before other tauopathy. Treating TBI mice with cis antibody blocks cistauosis, prevents tauopathy development and spread, and restores many TBI-related structural and functional sequelae. Thus, cis P-tau is a major early driver of disease after TBI and leads to tauopathy in chronic traumatic encephalopathy and Alzheimer's disease. The cis antibody may be further developed to detect and treat TBI, and prevent progressive neurodegeneration after injury.","[Kondo, Asami; Shahpasand, Koorosh; Chen, Chun-Hau; Yao, Yandan; Lin, Yu-Min; Driver, Jane A.; Wei, Shuo; Luo, Man-Li; Albayram, Onder; Huang, Pengyu; Zhou, Xiao Zhen; Lu, Kun Ping] Harvard Univ, Beth Israel Deaconess Med Ctr, Div Translat Therapeut, Dept Med,Med Sch, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Kondo, Asami; Shahpasand, Koorosh; Chen, Chun-Hau; Yao, Yandan; Lin, Yu-Min; Wei, Shuo; Luo, Man-Li; Albayram, Onder; Huang, Pengyu; Zhou, Xiao Zhen; Lu, Kun Ping] Harvard Univ, Beth Israel Deaconess Med Ctr, Canc Res Inst, Sch Med, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Mannix, Rebekah; Qiu, Jianhua] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Childrens Hosp Boston, Div Emergency Med, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Moncaster, Juliet; Goldstein, Lee E.; McKee, Ann C.] Boston Univ, Sch Med, Alzheimers Dis Ctr, CTE Program, Boston, MA 02118 USA; [Driver, Jane A.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Geriatr Res Educ & Clin Ctr, VA Boston Healthcare Syst, Boston, MA 02130 USA; [Sun, Yan; Rotenberg, Alexander] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Childrens Hosp Boston, Dept Neurol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Ryo, Akihide] Yokohama City Univ, Dept Microbiol, Sch Med, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2360004, Japan; [Pascual-Leone, Alvaro] Harvard Univ, Beth Israel Deaconess Med Ctr, Sch Med, Dept Neurol, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Meehan, William] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Childrens Hosp Boston, Micheli Ctr Sports Injury Prevent, Boston, MA 02115 USA","Lu, KP (reprint author), Harvard Univ, Beth Israel Deaconess Med Ctr, Div Translat Therapeut, Dept Med,Med Sch, Boston, MA 02215 USA.",xzhou@bidmc.harvard.edu; klu@bidmc.harvard.edu,,"Moncaster, Juliet/0000-0002-7849-4325","NIH [S10RR017927, T32HD040128, UO1NS086659-01, P30AG13846, R01AG029385, R01CA167677, R01HL111430, R01AG046319]; NIA; VA Career Development Award; Susan G.

In the accepted version of the 'emerging-flux' model, such a reconnection occurs at a plasma current sheet between the open field and the emerging closed field, and also forms a localized X-ray brightening that is usually observed at the edge of the jet's base(1,3). Here we report high-resolution X-ray and extreme-ultraviolet observations of 20 randomly selected X-ray jets that form in coronal holes at the Sun's poles. In each jet, contrary to the emerging-flux model, a miniature version of the filament eruptions that initiate coronal mass ejections(4-7) drives the jet-producing reconnection. The X-ray bright point occurs by reconnection of the 'legs' of the minifilament-carrying erupting closed field, analogous to the formation of solar flares in larger-scale eruptions. Previous observations have found that some jets are driven by base-field eruptions(8-11), but only one such study, of only one jet, provisionally questioned the emerging-flux model(12). Our observations support the view that solar filament eruptions are formed by a fundamental explosive magnetic process that occurs on a vast range of scales, from the biggest mass ejections and flare eruptions down to X-ray jets, and perhaps even down to smaller jets that may power coronal heating(10,13,14). A similar scenario has previously been suggested, but was inferred from different observations and based on a different origin of the erupting minifilament(15).","[Sterling, Alphonse C.; Moore, Ronald L.; Falconer, David A.; Adams, Mitzi] NASA, George C Marshall Space Flight Ctr, Huntsville, AL 35812 USA; [Moore, Ronald L.; Falconer, David A.] Univ Alabama, Ctr Space Plasma & Aeron Res, Huntsville, AL 35899 USA","Sterling, AC (reprint author), NASA, George C Marshall Space Flight Ctr, Huntsville, AL 35812 USA.",alphonse.sterling@nasa.gov; ron.moore@nasa.gov,,,Heliophysics Division of NASA's Science Mission Directorate through the Living With A Star Targeted Research and Technology Program(LWS TRT); Hinode Project,"A.C.S. and R.L.M. were supported by funding from the Heliophysics Division of NASA's Science Mission Directorate through the Living With A Star Targeted Research and Technology Program(LWS TR&T), and the Hinode Project.

Since then, and especially since the introduction of the origami technique(2), DNA nanotechnology has enabled increasingly more complex structures(3-18). But although general approaches for creating DNA origami polygonal meshes and design software are available(14,16,17,19-21), there are still important constraints arising from DNA geometry and sense/antisense pairing, necessitating some manual adjustment during the design process. Here we present a general method of folding arbitrary polygonal digital meshes in DNA that readily produces structures that would be very difficult to realize using previous approaches. The design process is highly automated, using a routeing algorithm based on graph theory and a relaxation simulation that traces scaffold strands through the target structures. Moreover, unlike conventional origami designs built from close-packed helices, our structures have a more open conformation with one helix per edge and are therefore stable under the ionic conditions usually used in biological assays.","[Benson, Erik; Gardell, Johan; Hogberg, Bjorn] Karolinska Inst, Dept Med Biochem & Biophys, SE-17177 Stockholm, Sweden; [Benson, Erik; Gardell, Johan; Hogberg, Bjorn] Karolinska Inst, Dept Neurosci, SE-17177 Stockholm, Sweden; [Mohammed, Abdulmelik; Czeizler, Eugen; Orponen, Pekka] Aalto Univ, Dept Comp Sci, FI-00076 Aalto, Finland; [Masich, Sergej] Karolinska Inst, Dept Cell & Mol Biol, SE-17177 Stockholm, Sweden","Hogberg, B (reprint author), Karolinska Inst, Dept Med Biochem & Biophys, SE-17177 Stockholm, Sweden.",bjorn.hogberg@ki.se,"Orponen, Pekka/E-7332-2012","Orponen, Pekka/0000-0002-0417-2104; Hogberg, Bjorn/0000-0003-2715-7887; Czeizler, Eugen/0000-0002-1607-1554","Swedish Research Council [2010-5060, 2013-5883]; Swedish Foundation for Strategic Research [FFL12-0219]; Knut and Alice Wallenberg foundation [KAW2014.0241]; Wallenberg Scholars grant; Helsinki Doctoral Education Network on Information and Communications Technology","This work was funded through grants from the Swedish Research Council (grants 2010-5060 and 2013-5883 to B.H.), the Swedish Foundation for Strategic Research (grant FFL12-0219 to B.H.) and the Knut and Alice Wallenberg foundation (Academy Fellow grant KAW2014.0241 to B.H.).

This is largely due to the fact that imines act as electrophiles towards carbon nucleophiles in reactions that form carbon-carbon bonds, thereby serving as one of the most widely used precursors for the formation of amines in both synthetic and biosynthetic settings(1-5). If the carbon atom of the imine could be rendered electron-rich, the imine could react as a nucleophile instead of as an electrophile. Such a reversal in the electronic characteristics of the imine functionality would facilitate the development of new chemical transformations that convert imines into amines via carbon-carbon bond-forming reactions with carbon electrophiles, thereby creating new opportunities for the efficient synthesis of amines. The development of asymmetric umpolung reactions of imines (in which the imines act as nucleophiles) remains uncharted territory, in spite of the far-reaching impact such reactions would have in organic synthesis. Here we report the discovery and development of new chiral phase-transfer catalysts that promote the highly efficient asymmetric umpolung reactions of imines with the carbon electrophile enals. These catalysts mediate the deprotonation of imines and direct the 2-azaallyl anions thus formed to react with enals in a highly chemoselective, regioselective, diastereoselective and enantioselective fashion. The reaction tolerates a broad range of imines and enals, and can be carried out in high yield with as little as 0.01 mole per cent catalyst with a moisture-and air-tolerant operational protocol. These umpolung reactions provide a conceptually new and practical approach to chiral amino compounds.","[Wu, Yongwei; Hu, Lin; Li, Zhe; Deng, Li] Brandeis Univ, Dept Chem, Waltham, MA 02454 USA","Deng, L (reprint author), Brandeis Univ, Dept Chem, 415 South St, Waltham, MA 02454 USA.",deng@brandeis.edu,,,National Institute of General Medical Science (NIH) [GM-61591],"We are grateful for financial support from the National Institute of General Medical Science (NIH, GM-61591).

It is widely assumed that the inferred redox change facilitated the observed trends in biodiversity. Establishing this palaeoenvironmental context, however, requires that changes in marine redox structure be tracked by means of geochemical proxies and translated into estimates of atmospheric oxygen. Iron-based proxies are among the most effective tools for tracking the redox chemistry of ancient oceans(3,4). These proxies are inherently local, but have global implications when analysed collectively and statistically. Here we analyse about 4,700 iron-speciation measurements from shales 2,300 to 360 million years old. Our statistical analyses suggest that subsurface water masses in mid-Proterozoic oceans were predominantly anoxic and ferruginous (depleted in dissolved oxygen and iron-bearing), but with a tendency towards euxinia (sulfide-bearing) that is not observed in the Neoproterozoic era. Analyses further indicate that early animals did not experience appreciable benthic sulfide stress. Finally, unlike proxies based on redox-sensitive trace-metal abundances(1,5,6), iron geochemical data do not show a statistically significant change in oxygen content through the Ediacaran and Cambrian periods, sharply constraining the magnitude of the end-Proterozoic oxygen increase. Indeed, this re-analysis of trace-metal data is consistent with oxygenation continuing well into the Palaeozoic era. Therefore, if changing redox conditions facilitated animal diversification, it did so through a limited rise in oxygen past critical functional and ecological thresholds, as is seen in modern oxygen minimum zone benthic animal communities(7-9).","[Sperling, Erik A.; Morgan, Alex S.; Macdonald, Francis A.; Knoll, Andrew H.; Johnston, David T.] Harvard Univ, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Sperling, Erik A.] Scripps Inst Oceanog, Integrat Oceanog Div, La Jolla, CA 90089 USA; [Wolock, Charles J.] Harvard Univ, Dept Organism & Evolutionary Biol, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Gill, Benjamin C.] Virginia Polytech Inst & State Univ, Dept Geosci, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA; [Kunzmann, Marcus; Halverson, Galen P.] McGill Univ, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, GEOTOP, Montreal, PQ H3A 0E8, Canada","Sperling, EA (reprint author), Stanford Univ, Dept Geol & Environm Sci, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",esper@stanford.edu; johnston@eps.harvard.edu,"Gill, Benjamin/B-8047-2012","Gill, Benjamin/0000-0001-7402-0811; Halverson, Galen/0000-0003-3061-7928",Agouron Geobiology Fellowship; NAI Postdoctoral Fellowship; NSF-EAR [1324095]; NASA Astrobiology Institute,"We thank D.

His population affinities have been the subject of scientific debate and legal controversy. Based on an initial study of cranial morphology it was asserted that Kennewick Man was neither Native American nor closely related to the claimant Plateau tribes of the Pacific Northwest, who claimed ancestral relationship and requested repatriation under the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act (NAGPRA). The morphological analysis was important to judicial decisions that Kennewick Man was not Native American and that therefore NAGPRA did not apply. Instead of repatriation, additional studies of the remains were permitted(2). Subsequent craniometric analysis affirmed Kennewick Man to be more closely related to circumpacific groups such as the Ainu and Polynesians than he is to modern Native Americans(2). In order to resolve Kennewick Man's ancestry and affiliations, we have sequenced his genome to similar to 1x coverage and compared it to worldwide genomic data including for the Ainu and Polynesians. We find that Kennewick Man is closer to modern Native Americans than to any other population worldwide. Among the Native American groups for whom genome-wide data are available for comparison, several seem to be descended from a population closely related to that of Kennewick Man, including the Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation (Colville), one of the five tribes claiming Kennewick Man. We revisit the cranial analyses and find that, as opposed to genome-wide comparisons, it is not possible on that basis to affiliate Kennewick Man to specific contemporary groups. We therefore conclude based on genetic comparisons that Kennewick Man shows continuity with Native North Americans over at least the last eight millennia.","[Rasmussen, Morten; Sikora, Martin; Korneliussen, Thorfinn Sand; Moreno-Mayar, J.

However, the effect of the more distant parental relatedness that is common in modern human populations is less well understood. Genomic data now allow us to investigate the effects of homozygosity on traits of public health importance by observing contiguous homozygous segments (runs of homozygosity), which are inferred to be homozygous along their complete length. Given the low levels of genome-wide homozygosity prevalent in most human populations, information is required on very large numbers of people to provide sufficient power(3,4). Here we use runs of homozygosity to study 16 health-related quantitative traits in 354,224 individuals from 102 cohorts, and find statistically significant associations between summed runs of homozygosity and four complex traits: height, forced expiratory lung volume in one second, general cognitive ability and educational attainment (P < 1 x 10(-300), 2.1 x 10(-6), 2.5 x 10(-10) and 1.8 x 10(-10), respectively). In each case, increased homozygosity was associated with decreased trait value, equivalent to the offspring of first cousins being 1.2 cm shorter and having 10 months' less education. Similar effect sizes were found across four continental groups and populations with different degrees of genome-wide homozygosity, providing evidence that homozygosity, rather than confounding, directly contributes to phenotypic variance. Contrary to earlier reports in substantially smaller samples(5,6), no evidence was seen of an influence of genome-wide homozygosity on blood pressure and low density lipoprotein cholesterol, or ten other cardio-metabolic traits. Since directional dominance is predicted for traits under directional evolutionary selection(7), this study provides evidence that increased stature and cognitive function have been positively selected in human evolution, whereas many important risk factors for late-onset complex diseases may not have been.","[Joshi, Peter K.; Rudan, Igor; Campbell, Harry; Polasek, Ozren; Wilson, James F.] Univ Edinburgh, Usher Inst Populat Hlth Sci & Informat, Ctr Global Hlth Res, Edinburgh EH8 9AG, Midlothian, Scotland; [Esko, Tonu; Maegi, Reedik; Mihailov, Evelin; Milani, Lili; Nelis, Mari; Tsernikova, Natalia; Morris, Andrew P.; Metspalu, Andres; Perola, Markus] Univ Tartu, Estonian Genome Ctr, EE-51010 Tartu, Estonia; [Esko, Tonu; Chan, Yingleong; Vedantam, Sailaja; Salem, Rany M.; Hirschhorn, Joel N.] Boston Childrens Hosp, Div Endocrinol, Cambridge, MA 02141 USA; [Esko, Tonu; Chan, Yingleong; Vedantam, Sailaja; Salem, Rany M.; Hirschhorn, Joel N.] Boston Childrens Hosp, Ctr Basic & Translat Obes Res, Cambridge, MA 02141 USA; [Esko, Tonu; Chan, Yingleong; Vedantam, Sailaja; Salem, Rany M.; Lindgren, Cecilia M.; Hirschhorn, Joel N.] Cambridge Ctr 7, Broad Inst, Program Med & Populat Genet, Cambridge, MA 02242 USA; [Esko, Tonu; Chan, Yingleong; Vedantam, Sailaja; Salem, Rany M.; Hirschhorn, Joel N.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Genet, Boston, MA USA; [Mattsson, Hannele; Eklund, Niina; Joensuu, Anni; Sarin, Antti-Pekka; Perola, Markus] Natl Inst Hlth & Welf, Unit Publ Hlth Genom, FI-00251 Helsinki, Finland; [Mattsson, Hannele; Joensuu, Anni; Pietilainen, Kirsi; Sarin, Antti-Pekka; Kaprio, Jaakko] Univ Helsinki, Inst Mol Med Finland FIMM, FI-00014 Helsinki, Finland; [Gandin, Ilaria; Vuckovic, Dragana; Pirastu, Nicola; Girotto, Giorgia] Univ Trieste, Dept Med Sci, I-34149 Trieste, Italy; [Nutile, Teresa; Ruggiero, Daniela; Ciullo, Marina] CNR, Inst Genet & Biophys A Buzzati Traverso, I-80131 Naples, Italy; [Jackson, Anne U.; Scott, Laura J.; Boehnke, Michael] Univ Michigan, Dept Biostat, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Jackson, Anne U.; Scott, Laura J.; Boehnke, Michael] Univ Michigan, Ctr Stat Genet, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Schurmann, Claudia; Bottinger, Erwin P.; Ellis, Stephen B.; Gottesman, Omri; Lu, Yingchang; Nadukuru, Rajiv; Loos, Ruth J.

As many prior inferences rely on methods that assume an absence of selection, potentially leading to artefactual results(2), we call mutation events directly using a parent-offspring sequencing strategy focusing on Arabidopsis and using rice and honey bee for replication. Here we show that mutation rates are higher in heterozygotes and in proximity to crossover events. A correlation between recombination rate and intraspecific diversity is in part owing to a higher mutation rate in domains of high recombination/ diversity. Implicating diversity per se as a cause, we find an similar to 3.5-fold higher mutation rate in heterozygotes than in homozygotes, with mutations occurring in closer proximity to heterozygous sites than expected by chance. In a genome that is a patchwork of heterozygous and homozygous domains, mutations occur disproportionately more often in the heterozygous domains. If segregating mutations predispose to a higher local mutation rate, clusters of genes dominantly under purifying selection (more commonly homozygous) and under balancing selection (more commonly heterozygous), might have low and high mutation rates, respectively. Our results are consistent with this, there being a ten times higher mutation rate in pathogen resistance genes, expected to be under positive or balancing selection. Consequently, we do not necessarily need to evoke extremely weak(1,2) selection on the mutation rate to explain why mutational hot and cold spots might correspond to regions under positive/balancing and purifying selection, respectively(3,4).","[Yang, Sihai; Wang, Long; Huang, Ju; Zhang, Xiaohui; Yuan, Yang; Chen, Jian-Qun; Tian, Dacheng] Nanjing Univ, Sch Life Sci, State Key Lab Pharmaceut Biotechnol, Nanjing 210023, Peoples R China; [Hurst, Laurence D.] Univ Bath, Dept Biol & Biochem, Milner Ctr Evolut, Bath BA2 7AY, Avon, England","Tian, DC (reprint author), Nanjing Univ, Sch Life Sci, State Key Lab Pharmaceut Biotechnol, Nanjing 210023, Peoples R China.",bssldh@bath.ac.uk; dtian@nju.edu.cn,"Hurst, Laurence/F-9215-2010","Hurst, Laurence/0000-0002-1002-1054","National Natural Science Foundation of China [91331205, 91231102, 31170210]; Program for Changjiang Scholars and Innovative Research Team [IRT_14R27]; Jiangsu Collaborative Innovation Center for Modern Crop Production","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (91331205, 91231102 and 31170210), Program for Changjiang Scholars and Innovative Research Team (IRT_14R27) and Jiangsu Collaborative Innovation Center for Modern Crop Production to D.T., S.H. and J.-Q.C., respectively.",,43,31,32,7,81,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,23-Jul,2015,523,7561,,,,,463,U187,,10.1038/nature14649,,11,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,CN4DD,WOS:000358378900037,26176923,No,,,11/19/17

Here we develop a competitive HSPC transplant method in adult zebrafish, using in vivo imaging as a non-invasive readout. We use this system to conduct a chemical screen, and identify epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs) as a family of lipids(1,2) that enhance HSPC engraftment. The pro-haematopoietic effects of EETs were conserved in the developing zebrafish embryo, where 11,12-EET promoted HSPC specification by activating a unique activator protein 1 (AP-1) and runx1 transcription program autonomous to the haemogenic endothelium. This effect required the activation of the phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase (PI(3) K) pathway, specifically PI(3) K gamma. In adult HSPCs, 11,12-EET induced transcriptional programs, including AP-1 activation, which modulate several cellular processes, such as migration, to promote engraftment. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the EET effects on enhancing HSPC homing and engraftment are conserved in mammals. Our study establishes a new method to explore the molecular mechanisms of HSPC engraftment, and discovers a previously unrecognized, evolutionarily conserved pathway regulating multiple haematopoietic generation and regeneration processes. EETs may have clinical application in marrow or cord blood transplantation.","[Li, Pulin; Lahvic, Jamie L.; Binder, Vera; Pugach, Emily K.; Riley, Elizabeth B.; Tamplin, Owen J.; Bowman, Teresa V.; Barrett, Francesca G.; Heffner, Garrett C.; Schlaeger, Thorsten M.; Daley, George Q.; Zon, Leonard I.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Stem Cell Program, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Li, Pulin; Lahvic, Jamie L.; Binder, Vera; Pugach, Emily K.; Riley, Elizabeth B.; Tamplin, Owen J.; Bowman, Teresa V.; Barrett, Francesca G.; Heffner, Garrett C.; Schlaeger, Thorsten M.; Daley, George Q.; Zon, Leonard I.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Boston Childrens Hosp, Div Haematol Oncol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Li, Pulin; Lahvic, Jamie L.; Binder, Vera; Pugach, Emily K.; Riley, Elizabeth B.; Tamplin, Owen J.; Bowman, Teresa V.; Barrett, Francesca G.; Heffner, Garrett C.; Schlaeger, Thorsten M.; Daley, George Q.; Zon, Leonard I.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Dana Farber Canc Inst, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Li, Pulin; Zon, Leonard I.] Harvard Univ, Chem Biol Program, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Binder, Vera] Univ Munich, Dr von Hauner Childrens Hosp, Dept Hematol & Oncol, D-80337 Munich, Germany; [Panigrahy, Dipak] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Beth Israel Deaconess Med Ctr, Ctr Vasc Biol Res, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [McKinney-Freeman, Shannon] St Jude Childrens Res Hosp, Dept Haematol, Memphis, TN 38105 USA; [Zeldin, Darryl C.] Natl Inst Environm Hlth Sci, Div Intramural Res, NIH, Res Triangle Pk, NC 27709 USA","Zon, LI (reprint author), Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Stem Cell Program, Boston, MA 02115 USA.",zon@enders.tch.harvard.edu,"Binder, Vera/N-2078-2015",,"NIH [P50-NS40828, P30-HD18655]; HHMI; National Institutes of Health (NIH) [R01 HL04880, P015PO1HL32262-32, 5P30 DK49216, 5R01 DK53298, 5U01 HL10001-05, R24 DK092760, 1R01HL097794-04]; Intramural Research Program of the NIH, National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences [Z01 ES025034]; National Cancer Institute [ROCA148633-01A5]; DFG; Care-for-Rare Foundation","We thank C.

It has been hypothesized that the redox rhythm is linked to the circadian clock, but the mechanism and the biological significance of this link have only begun to be investigated(4-7). Here we report that the master immune regulator NPR1 (non-expressor of pathogenesis-related gene 1) of Arabidopsis is a sensor of the plant's redox state and regulates transcription of core circadian clock genes even in the absence of pathogen challenge. Surprisingly, acute perturbation in the redox status triggered by the immune signal salicylic acid does not compromise the circadian clock but rather leads to its reinforcement. Mathematical modelling and subsequent experiments show that NPR1 reinforces the circadian clock without changing the period by regulating both the morning and the evening clock genes. This balanced network architecture helps plants gate their immune responses towards the morning and minimize costs on growth at night. Our study demonstrates how a sensitive redox rhythm interacts with a robust circadian clock to ensure proper responsiveness to environmental stimuli without compromising fitness of the organism.","[Zhou, Mian; Wang, Wei; Mwimba, Musoki; Marques, Jorge; Dong, Xinnian] Duke Univ, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Gordon & Betty Moore Fdn, Durham, NC 27708 USA; [Zhou, Mian; Wang, Wei; Mwimba, Musoki; Marques, Jorge; Buchler, Nicolas E.; Dong, Xinnian] Duke Univ, Dept Biol, Durham, NC 27708 USA; [Karapetyan, Sargis; Buchler, Nicolas E.] Duke Univ, Dept Phys, Durham, NC 27708 USA","Dong, XN (reprint author), Duke Univ, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Gordon & Betty Moore Fdn, Durham, NC 27708 USA.",nb69@duke.edu; xdong@duke.edu,"Wang, Wei/I-5230-2015; Marques, Jorge/J-6276-2016; Zhou, Mian/I-9261-2017","Wang, Wei/0000-0002-3780-5158; Marques, Jorge/0000-0002-1684-115X; Buchler, Nicolas/0000-0003-3940-3432","National Institutes of Health (NIH) [1R01-GM099839-01, 2R01-GM069594-09]; Howard Hughes Medical Institute; Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation [GBMF3032]; Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) Biochronicity Grant [DARPA-BAA-11-66]; NIH [DP2 OD008654-01]; Burroughs Wellcome Fund CASI Award [BWF 1005769.01]","We thank R.

Diarrhoeal disease is estimated to be responsible for 10.5% of overall child mortality(4). Cryptosporidium is also an opportunistic pathogen in the contexts of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-caused AIDS and organ transplantation(5,6). There is no vaccine and only a single approved drug that provides no benefit for those in gravest danger: malnourished children and immunocompromised patients(7,8). Cryptosporidiosisdrug and vaccine development is limited by the poor tractability of the parasite, which includes a lack of systems for continuous culture, facile animal models, and molecular genetic tools(3,9). Here we describe an experimental framework to genetically modify this important human pathogen. We established and optimized transfection of C. parvum sporozoites in tissue culture. To isolate stable transgenics we developed a mouse model that delivers sporozoites directly into the intestine, aCryptosporidium clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)/Cas9 system, and in vivo selection for aminoglycoside resistance. We derived reporter parasites suitable for in vitro and in vivo drug screening, and we evaluated the basis of drug susceptibility by gene knockout. We anticipate that the ability to genetically engineer this parasite will be transformative for Cryptosporidium research. Genetic reporters will provide quantitative correlates for disease, cure and protection, and the role of parasite genes in these processes is now open to rigorous investigation.","[Vinayak, Sumiti; Pawlowic, Mattie C.; Sateriale, Adam; Brooks, Carrie F.; Studstill, Caleb J.; Bar-Peled, Yael; Cipriano, Michael J.; Striepen, Boris] Univ Georgia, Ctr Trop & Emerging Global Dis, Paul D Coverdell Ctr, Athens, GA 30602 USA; [Striepen, Boris] Univ Georgia, Dept Cellular Biol, Paul D Coverdell Ctr, Athens, GA 30602 USA","Striepen, B (reprint author), Univ Georgia, Ctr Trop & Emerging Global Dis, Paul D Coverdell Ctr, 500 DW Brooks Dr, Athens, GA 30602 USA.",striepen@uga.edu,,"Striepen, Boris/0000-0002-7426-432X; Studstill, Caleb/0000-0003-3795-0774",National Institutes of Health (NIH) [R01AI112427]; Centers for Disease Control; University of Georgia Research Foundation;  [NIH T32AI060546],"We thank L.

As a result, it can often be difficult to target double-stranded breaks (DSBs) with the precision that is necessary for various genome-editing applications. The ability to engineer Cas9 derivatives with purposefully altered PAM specificities would address this limitation. Here we show that the commonly used Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9 (SpCas9) can be modified to recognize alternative PAM sequences using structural information, bacterial selection-based directed evolution, and combinatorial design. These altered PAM specificity variants enable robust editing of endogenous gene sites in zebrafish and human cells not currently targetable by wild-type SpCas9, and their genome-wide specificities are comparable to wild-type SpCas9 as judged by GUIDE-seq analysis(7). In addition, we identify and characterize another SpCas9 variant that exhibits improved specificity in human cells, possessing better discrimination against off-target sites with non-canonical NAG and NGAPAMs and/or mismatched spacers. We also find that two smaller-size Cas9 orthologues, Streptococcus thermophilus Cas9 (St1Cas9) and Staphylococcus aureus Cas9 (SaCas9), function efficiently in the bacterial selection systems and in human cells, suggesting that our engineering strategies could be extended to Cas9s from other species. Our findings provide broadly useful SpCas9 variants and, more importantly, establish the feasibility of engineering a wide range of Cas9s with altered and improved PAM specificities.","[Kleinstiver, Benjamin P.; Prew, Michelle S.; Tsai, Shengdar Q.; Topkar, Ved V.; Nguyen, Nhu T.; Zheng, Zongli; Aryee, Martin J.; Joung, J.

Although recent advances have improved our ability to document cellular phenotypic variation(4-8), the fundamental mechanisms that generate variability from identical DNA sequences remain elusive. Here we reveal the landscape and principles of mammalian DNA regulatory variation by developing a robust method for mapping the accessible genome of individual cells by assay for transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing (ATAC-seq)(9) integrated into a programmable microfluidics platform. Single-cell ATAC-seq (scATAC-seq) maps from hundreds of single cells in aggregate closely resemble accessibility profiles from tens of millions of cells and provide insights into cell-to-cell variation. Accessibility variance is systematically associated with specific trans-factors and cis-elements, and we discover combinations of trans-factors associated with either induction or suppression of cell-to-cell variability. We further identify sets of trans-factors associated with cell-type-specific accessibility variance across eight cell types. Targeted perturbations of cell cycle or transcription factor signalling evoke stimulus-specific changes in this observed variability. The pattern of accessibility variation in cis across the genome recapitulates chromosome compartments(10) de novo, linking single-cell accessibility variation to three-dimensional genome organization. Single-cell analysis of DNA accessibility provides new insight into cellular variation of the 'regulome'.","[Buenostro, Jason D.; Wu, Beijing; Snyder, Michael P.; Greenleaf, William J.] Stanford Univ, Dept Genet, Sch Med, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Buenostro, Jason D.; Litzenburger, Ulrike M.; Chang, Howard Y.] Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Program Epithelial Biol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Buenostro, Jason D.; Litzenburger, Ulrike M.; Chang, Howard Y.] Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Ruff, Dave; Gonzales, Michael L.] Fluidigm Corp, San Francisco, CA 94080 USA; [Greenleaf, William J.] Stanford Univ, Dept Appl Phys, Stanford, CA 94025 USA","Greenleaf, WJ (reprint author), Stanford Univ, Dept Genet, Sch Med, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",howchang@stanford.edu; wjg@stanford.edu,,,National Institutes of Health (NIH) [P50HG007735]; Lifespan Extension Foundation; Rita Allen Foundation; Baxter Foundation Faculty Scholar Grant; National Science Foundation; NIH [T32HG000044]; National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) [5U54HG00455805];  [UH2 AR067676];  [U19AI057266],"This work was supported by National Institutes of Health (NIH) P50HG007735 (to H.Y.C. and W.J.G.), UH2 AR067676 and Lifespan Extension Foundation (H.Y.C.), U19AI057266 (to W.J.G.) and the Rita Allen Foundation (to W.J.G.) and the Baxter Foundation Faculty Scholar Grant (to W.J.G); H.Y.C. is an Early Career Scientist of the Howard Hughes Medical Institute.

However, crustal heterogeneity has prevented a thorough geochemical comparison of its primary igneous building blocks-volcanic and plutonic rocks-and the processes by which they differentiate to felsic compositions. Our analysis of a comprehensive global data set of volcanic and plutonic whole-rock geochemistry shows that differentiation trends from primitive basaltic to felsic compositions for volcanic versus plutonic samples are generally indistinguishable in subduction-zone settings, but are divergent in continental rifts. Offsets in major- and trace-element differentiation patterns in rift settings suggest higher water content in plutonic magmas and reduced eruptibility of hydrous silicate magmas relative to dry rift volcanics. In both tectonic settings, our results indicate that fractional crystallization, rather than crustal melting, is predominantly responsible for the production of intermediate and felsic magmas, emphasizing the role of mafic cumulates as a residue of crustal differentiation.","[Keller, C.

In the legume-rhizobium symbiosis, bacterial exopolysaccharides (EPS) are essential for the development of infected root nodules. We have identified a gene in Lotus japonicus, Epr3, encoding a receptor-like kinase that controls this infection. We show that epr3 mutants are defective in perception of purified EPS, and that EPR3 binds EPS directly and distinguishes compatible and incompatible EPS in bacterial competition studies. Expression of Epr3 in epidermal cells within the susceptible root zone shows that the protein is involved in bacterial entry, while rhizobial and plant mutant studies suggest that Epr3 regulates bacterial passage through the plant's epidermal cell layer. Finally, we show that Epr3 expression is inducible and dependent on host perception of bacterial nodulation ( Nod) factors. Plant-bacterial compatibility and bacterial access to legume roots is thus regulated by a two-stage mechanism involving sequential receptor-mediated recognition of Nod factor and EPS signals.","[Kawaharada, Y.; Kelly, S.; Nielsen, M.

Here we show that PR is not merely an ER alpha-induced gene target, but is also an ER alpha-associated protein that modulates its behaviour. In the presence of agonist ligands, PR associates with ER alpha to direct ER alpha chromatin binding events within breast cancer cells, resulting in a unique gene expression programme that is associated with good clinical outcome. Progesterone inhibited oestrogen-mediated growth of ER alpha(+) cell line xenografts and primary ER alpha(+) breast tumour explants, and had increased anti-proliferative effects when coupled with an ER alpha antagonist. Copy number loss of PGR, the gene coding for PR, is a common feature in ER alpha(+) breast cancers, explaining lower PR levels in a subset of cases. Our findings indicate that PR functions as a molecular rheostat to control ER alpha chromatin binding and transcriptional activity, which has important implications for prognosis and therapeutic interventions.","[Mohammed, Hisham; Russell, I.

The discovery of multiple populations in clusters(1,2) that were previously believed to have single populations gave rise to the currently accepted theory that the hottest horizontal branch members (the 'blue hook' stars, which had late helium-core flash ignition(3), followed by deep mixing(4,5)) are the progeny of a helium-rich 'second generation' of stars(6,7). It is not known why such a supposedly rare event(8,9) (a late flash followed by mixing) is so common that the blue hook of omega Centauri contains approximately 30 per cent of the horizontal branch stars in the cluster(10), or why the blue hook luminosity range in this massive cluster cannot be reproduced by models. Here we report that the presence of helium core masses up to about 0.04 solar masses larger than the core mass resulting from evolution is required to solve the luminosity range problem. We model this by taking into account the dispersion in rotation rates achieved by the progenitors, whose pre-main-sequence accretion disk suffered an early disruption in the dense environment of the cluster's central regions, where second-generation stars form(11). Rotation may also account for frequent late-flash-mixing events in massive globular clusters.","[Tailo, Marco; D'Antona, Francesca; Di Criscienzo, Marcella; Ventura, Paolo; Decressin, Thibaut] INAF Osservatorio Astron Roma, I-00040 Rome, Italy; [Tailo, Marco; Capuzzo-Dolcetta, Roberto] Univ Roma La Sapienza, Dipartimento Fis, I-00185 Rome, Italy; [Vesperini, Enrico] Indiana Univ, Dept Astron, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA; [Milone, Antonino P.; Dotter, Aaron] Australian Natl Univ, Res Sch Astron & Astrophys, Canberra, ACT 2611, Australia; [Bellini, Andrea] Space Telescope Sci Inst, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA; [D'Ercole, Annibale] INAF Osservatorio Astron Bologna, I-40127 Bologna, Italy; [Caloi, Vittoria] IAPS, INAF, I-00133 Rome, Italy","D'Antona, F (reprint author), INAF Osservatorio Astron Roma, I-00040 Rome, Italy.",franca.dantona@gmail.com,,"d'ercole, annibale/0000-0002-5531-5320; Capuzzo Dolcetta, Roberto/0000-0002-6871-9519","Australian Research Council [DE150101816]; PRIN INAF ""Multiple populations in globular clusters: their role in the Galaxy assembly''; PRIN MIUR, project ""The Chemical and Dynamical Evolution of the Milky Way and Local Group Galaxies''; UE Program (FP7) of Astronomy Fellowships in Italy (ASTROFit) [267251]; INAF-OAR; STScI grant [AR-12656];  [NASANNX13AF45G]","A.P.M. acknowledges support by the Australian Research Council through Discovery Early Career Researcher Award DE150101816.

None of the molecules responsible for these bands have been conclusively identified(2). Two bands at 9,632 (a) over circle ngstroms and 9,577 (a) over circle ngstroms were reported in 1994, and were suggested to arise from C-60(+) molecules (ref. 3), on the basis of the proximity of these wavelengths to the absorption bands of C-60(+) measured in a neon matrix(4). Confirmation of this assignment requires the gas-phase spectrum of C-60(+). Here we report laboratory spectroscopy of C-60(+) in the gas phase, cooled to 5.8 kelvin. The absorption spectrum hasmaxima at 9,632.7 +/- 0.1 (a) over circle ngstroms and 9,577.5 +/- 0.1 (a) over circle ngstroms, and the full widths at half-maximum of these bands are 2.2 +/- 0.2 (a) over circle ngstroms and 2.5 +/- 0.2 (a) over circle ngstroms, respectively.

Crystalline coherence is preserved even when atomic identity is modulated, a fact that is the critical enabler of quantum wells, wires, and dots(6-10). The interfacial quality achieved as a result of hetero-epitaxial growth allows new combinations of materials with complementary properties, which enables the design and realization of functionalities that are not available in the single-phase constituents. Here we show that organohalide perovskites and preformed colloidal quantum dots, combined in the solution phase, produce epitaxially aligned 'dots-in-a-matrix' crystals. Using transmission electron microscopy and electron diffraction, we reveal heterocrystals as large as about 60 nanometres and containing at least 20 mutually aligned dots that inherit the crystalline orientation of the perovskite matrix. The heterocrystals exhibit remarkable optoelectronic properties that are traceable to their atom-scale crystalline coherence: photoelectrons and holes generated in the larger-bandgap perovskites are transferred with 80% efficiency to become excitons in the quantum dot nanocrystals, which exploit the excellent photocarrier diffusion of perovskites to produce bright-light emission from infrared-bandgap quantum-tuned materials. By combining the electrical transport properties of the perovskite matrix with the high radiative efficiency of the quantum dots, we engineer a new platform to advance solution-processed infrared optoelectronics.","[Ning, Zhijun; Gong, Xiwen; Comin, Riccardo; Walters, Grant; Fan, Fengjia; Voznyy, Oleksandr; Yassitepe, Emre; Buin, Andrei; Hoogland, Sjoerd; Sargent, Edward H.] Univ Toronto, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Toronto, ON M5S 1A4, Canada","Sargent, EH (reprint author), Univ Toronto, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, 35 St George St, Toronto, ON M5S 1A4, Canada.",ted.sargent@utoronto.ca,"Ning , Zhijun/A-3601-2013; Comin, Riccardo/H-7731-2016","Comin, Riccardo/0000-0002-1069-9973",King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST) [KUS-11-009-21]; Ontario Research Fund Research Excellence Program; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC) of Canada; FAPESP-BEPE [14/18327-9],"This publication is based, in part, on work supported by an award (KUS-11-009-21) from the King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST), by the Ontario Research Fund Research Excellence Program and by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC) of Canada.

Niche signals act over a short range such that only stem cells but not their differentiating progeny receive the self-renewing signals(1). However, the cellular mechanisms that limit niche signalling to stem cells remain poorly understood. Here we show that the Drosophila male germline stem cells form previously unrecognized structures, microtubule-based nanotubes, which extend into the hub, a major niche component. Microtubule-based nanotubes are observed specifically within germline stem cell populations, and require intraflagellar transport proteins for their formation. The bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) receptor Tkv localizes to microtubule-based nanotubes. Perturbation of microtubule-based nanotubes compromises activation of Dpp signalling within germline stem cells, leading to germline stem cell loss. Moreover, Dpp ligand and Tkv receptor interaction is necessary and sufficient for microtubule-based nanotube formation. We propose that microtubule-based nanotubes provide a novel mechanism for selective receptor-ligand interaction, contributing to the short-range nature of niche-stem-cell signalling.","[Inaba, Mayu; Yamashita, Yukiko M.] Univ Michigan, Life Sci Inst, Dept Cell & Dev Biol, Sch Med, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Inaba, Mayu; Yamashita, Yukiko M.] Univ Michigan, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Inaba, Mayu; Buszczak, Michael] Univ Texas SW Med Ctr Dallas, Dept Mol Biol, Dallas, TX 75390 USA","Buszczak, M (reprint author), Univ Texas SW Med Ctr Dallas, Dept Mol Biol, Dallas, TX 75390 USA.",michael.buszczak@utsouthwestern.edu; yukikomy@umich.edu,,"Yamashita, Yukiko/0000-0001-5541-0216",Howard Hughes Medical Institute; MacArthur Foundation,"We thank T.

For Escherichia coli, this includes river water as well as humans and animals, where it can be both a commensal and a pathogen(1-3). Intricate regulatory mechanisms ensure that bacteria have the right complement of beta-barrel outer membrane proteins (OMPs) to enable adaptation to a particular habitat(4,5). Yet no mechanism is known for replacing OMPs in the outer membrane, an issue that is further confounded by the lack of an energy source and the high stability(6) and abundance of OMPs(5). Here we uncover the process underpinning OMP turnover in Escherichia coli and show it to be passive and binary in nature, in which old OMPs are displaced to the poles of growing cells as new OMPs take their place. Using fluorescent colicins as OMP-specific probes, in combination with ensemble and single-molecule fluorescence microscopy in vivo and in vitro, as well as molecular dynamics simulations, we established the mechanism for binary OMP partitioning. OMPs clustered to form 0.5-mu m diameter islands, where their diffusion is restricted by promiscuous interactions with other OMPs. OMP islands were distributed throughout the cell and contained the Bam complex, which catalyses the insertion of OMPs in the outer membrane(7,8). However, OMP biogenesis occurred as a gradient that was highest at mid-cell but largely absent at cell poles. The cumulative effect is to push old OMP islands towards the poles of growing cells, leading to a binary distribution when cells divide. Hence, the outer membrane of a Gram-negative bacterium is a spatially and temporally organized structure, and this organization lies at the heart of how OMPs are turned over in the membrane.","[Rassam, Patrice; Chavent, Matthieu; Duncan, Anna L.; Housden, Nicholas G.; Kaminska, Renata; Sansom, Mark S.

Although it is now accepted that the central nervous system undergoes constant immune surveillance that takes place within the meningeal compartment(1-3), the mechanisms governing the entrance and exit of immune cells from the central nervous system remain poorly understood(4-6). In searching for T-cell gateways into and out of the meninges, we discovered functional lymphatic vessels lining the dural sinuses. These structures express all of the molecular hallmarks of lymphatic endothelial cells, are able to carry both fluid and immune cells from the cerebrospinal fluid, and are connected to the deep cervical lymph nodes. The unique location of these vessels may have impeded their discovery to date, thereby contributing to the long-held concept of the absence of lymphatic vasculature in the central nervous system. The discovery of the central nervous system lymphatic system may call for a reassessment of basic assumptions in neuroimmunology and sheds new light on the aetiology of neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative diseases associated with immune system dysfunction.","[Louveau, Antoine; Smirnov, Igor; Keyes, Timothy J.; Derecki, Noel C.; Lee, Kevin S.; Harris, Tajie H.; Kipnis, Jonathan] Univ Virginia, Sch Med, Ctr Brain Immunol & Glia, Charlottesville, VA 22908 USA; [Louveau, Antoine; Smirnov, Igor; Keyes, Timothy J.; Derecki, Noel C.; Lee, Kevin S.; Harris, Tajie H.; Kipnis, Jonathan] Univ Virginia, Sch Med, Dept Neurosci, Charlottesville, VA 22908 USA; [Eccles, Jacob D.; Rouhani, Sherin J.; Peske, J.

For example, circulating sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) is a key regulator of lymphocyte egress(1,2). Although the majority of plasma S1P is bound to apolipoprotein M (ApoM) in the high-density lipoprotein (HDL) particle(3), the immunological functions of the ApoM-S1P complex are unknown. Here we show that ApoM-S1P is dispensable for lymphocyte trafficking yet restrains lymphopoiesis by activating the S1P1 receptor on bone marrow lymphocyte progenitors. Mice that lacked ApoM (Apom(-/-)) had increased proliferation of Lin(-) Sca-1(+) cKit(+) haematopoietic progenitor cells (LSKs) and common lymphoid progenitors (CLPs) in bone marrow. Pharmacological activation or genetic overexpression of S1P(1) suppressed LSK and CLP cell proliferation in vivo. ApoM was stably associated with bone marrow CLPs, which showed active S1P(1) signalling in vivo(4). Moreover, ApoM-bound S1P, but not albumin-bound S1P, inhibited lymphopoiesis in vitro. Upon immune stimulation, Apom(-/-) mice developed more severe experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis5, characterized by increased lymphocytes in the central nervous system and breakdown of the blood-brain barrier. Thus, the ApoM-S1P-S1P(1) signalling axis restrains the lymphocyte compartment and, subsequently, adaptive immune responses. Unique biological functions imparted by specific S1P chaperones could be exploited for novel therapeutic opportunities.","[Blaho, Victoria A.; Galvani, Sylvain; Engelbrecht, Eric; Liu, Catherine; Swendeman, Steven L.; Hla, Timothy] Cornell Univ, Weill Med Coll, Dept Pathol & Lab Med, Ctr Vasc Biol, New York, NY 10065 USA; [Blaho, Victoria A.; Hla, Timothy] Cornell Univ, Weill Med Coll, Brain & Mind Res Inst, New York, NY 10065 USA; [Kono, Mari; Proia, Richard L.] NIDDK, Genet Dev & Dis Branch, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Steinman, Lawrence; Han, May H.] Stanford Univ, Dept Neurol & Neurol Sci, Stanford, CA 94305 USA","Hla, T (reprint author), Cornell Univ, Weill Med Coll, Dept Pathol & Lab Med, Ctr Vasc Biol, New York, NY 10065 USA.",tih2002@med.cornell.edu,,"Hla, Timothy/0000-0001-8355-4065; Proia, Richard/0000-0003-0456-1270","National Institutes of Health (NIH) [F32 CA14211]; New York Stem Cell Foundation [C026878]; NIH, Fondation Leducq [HL67330, HL70694, HL89934]; Intramural program of the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, NIH; Fondation Leducq; Lipidomics Shared Resource, Hollings Cancer Center, Medical University of South Carolina [P30 CA138313]; Lipidomics Core in the SC Lipidomics and Pathobiology COBRE [P20 RR017677]","The authors thank C.

Essential for resistance, DHT synthesis from adrenal precursor steroids or possibly from de novo synthesis from cholesterol commonly requires enzymatic reactions by 3 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3 beta HSD), steroid-5 alpha-reductase (SRD5A) and 17 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (17 beta HSD) isoenzymes(4,5). Abiraterone, a steroidal 17 alpha-hydroxylase/17,20-lyase (CYP17A1) inhibitor, blocks this synthetic process and prolongs survival(6,7). We hypothesized that abiraterone is converted by an enzyme to the more active Delta(4)-abiraterone (D4A), which blocks multiple steroidogenic enzymes and antagonizes the androgen receptor, providing an additional explanation for abiraterone's clinical activity. Here we show that abiraterone is converted to D4A in mice and patients with prostate cancer. D4A inhibits CYP17A1, 3 beta HSD and SRD5A, which are required for DHT synthesis. Furthermore, competitive androgen receptor antagonism by D4A is comparable to the potent antagonist enzalutamide. D4A also has more potent anti-tumour activity against xenograft tumours than abiraterone. Our findings suggest an additional explanation-conversion to a more active agent-for abiraterone's survival extension. We propose that direct treatment with D4A would be more clinically effective than abiraterone treatment.","[Li, Zhenfei; Bishop, Andrew C.; Alyamani, Mohammad; Sharifi, Nima] Cleveland Clin, Lerner Res Inst, Dept Canc Biol, Cleveland, OH 44195 USA; [Garcia, Jorge A.; Dreicer, Robert; Sharifi, Nima] Cleveland Clin, Taussig Canc Inst, Dept Hematol & Oncol, Cleveland, OH 44195 USA; [Garcia, Jorge A.; Dreicer, Robert; Sharifi, Nima] Cleveland Clin, Glickman Urol & Kidney Inst, Dept Urol, Cleveland, OH 44195 USA; [Bunch, Dustin] Cleveland Clin, Dept Lab Med Pathol & Lab, Inst Med, Cleveland, OH 44195 USA; [Liu, Jiayan; Upadhyay, Sunil K.; Auchus, Richard J.] Univ Michigan, Sch Med, Dept Internal Med, Div Endocrinol & Metab, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Auchus, Richard J.] Univ Michigan, Sch Med, Dept Pharmacol, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA","Sharifi, N (reprint author), Cleveland Clin, Lerner Res Inst, Dept Canc Biol, Cleveland, OH 44195 USA.",sharifn@ccf.org,"Alyamani, Mohammad/S-5905-2017","Alyamani, Mohammad/0000-0002-7127-0820; li, zhenfei/0000-0001-6520-431X","Howard Hughes Physician-Scientist Early Career Award; Prostate Cancer Foundation; American Cancer Society [12-038-01-CCE]; US Army Medical Research and Materiel Command [PC080193, PC121382]; National Cancer Institute [R01CA168899, R01CA172382, R01CA190289]","This work has been supported in part by funding from a Howard Hughes Physician-Scientist Early Career Award (to N.S.), by the Prostate Cancer Foundation (to N.S.), by an American Cancer Society Research Scholar Award (12-038-01-CCE; to N.S.), grants from the US Army Medical Research and Materiel Command (PC080193 to N.S. and PC121382 to Z.L.), and additional grants from the National Cancer Institute (R01CA168899, R01CA172382, and R01CA190289; to N.S.).",,26,62,64,4,28,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,16-Jul,2015,523,7560,,,,,347,+,,10.1038/nature14406,,14,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,CM8KY,WOS:000357950900042,26030522,No,Y,N,11/19/17

Mutant p53 (mutp53) proteins undergo massive constitutive stabilization specifically in tumours, which is the key requisite for the acquisition of gain-of-functions activities(6-8). Although currently 11 million patients worldwide live with tumours expressing highly stabilized mutp53, it is unknown whether mutp53 is a therapeutic target in vivo. Here we use a novel mutp53 mouse model expressing an inactivatable R248Q hotspot mutation (floxQ) to show that tumours depend on sustained mutp53 expression. Upon tamoxifen-induced mutp53 ablation, allotransplanted and autochthonous tumours curb their growth, thus extending animal survival by 37%, and advanced tumours undergo apoptosis and tumour regression or stagnation. The HSP90/HDAC6 chaperone machinery, which is significantly upregulated in cancer compared with normal tissues, is a major determinant of mutp53 stabilization(9-12). We show that long-term HSP90 inhibition significantly extends the survival of mutp53 Q/- (R248Q allele(2)) and H/H (R172H allele(3)) mice by 59% and 48%, respectively, but not their corresponding p53(-/-) (also known as Trp53(-/-)) littermates. This mutp53-dependent drug effect occurs in H/H mice treated with 17DMAG+SAHA and in H/H and Q/- mice treated with the potent Hsp90 inhibitor ganetespib. Notably, drug activity correlates with induction of mutp53 degradation, tumour apoptosis and prevention of T-cell lymphomagenesis. These proof-of-principle data identify mutp53 as an actionable cancer-specific drug target.","[Alexandrova, E. M.; Yallowitz, A. R.; Li, D.; Xu, S.; Moll, U.

This process is subjected to the inherent perturbations of cellular noise(1,2) and thus requires regulation for cell-size homeostasis. The mechanisms underlying the control and dynamics of cell size remain poorly understood owing to the difficulty in sizing individual bacteria over long periods of time in a high-throughput manner. Here we measure and analyse long-term, single-cell growth and division across different Escherichia coli strains and growth conditions(3). We show that a subset of cells in a population exhibit transient oscillations in cell size with periods that stretch across several (more than ten) generations. Our analysis reveals that a simple law governing cell-size control-a noisy linear map-explains the origins of these cell-size oscillations across all strains. This noisy linear map implements a negative feedback on cell-size control: a cell with a larger initial size tends to divide earlier, whereas one with a smaller initial size tends to divide later. Combining simulations of cell growth and division with experimental data, we demonstrate that this noisy linear map generates transient oscillations, not just in cell size, but also in constitutive gene expression. Our work provides new insights into the dynamics of bacterial cell-size regulation with implications for the physiological processes involved.","[Tanouchi, Yu; Pai, Anand; Huang, Shuqiang; You, Lingchong] Duke Univ, Dept Biomed Engn, Durham, NC 27708 USA; [Park, Heungwon; Buchler, Nicolas E.] Duke Univ, Dept Phys, Durham, NC 27708 USA; [Park, Heungwon; Buchler, Nicolas E.] Duke Univ, Dept Biol, Durham, NC 27708 USA; [Stamatov, Rumen] Duke Univ, Computat Biol & Bioinformat, Durham, NC 27708 USA; [Buchler, Nicolas E.; You, Lingchong] Duke Univ, Ctr Genom & Computat Biol, Durham, NC 27708 USA","You, LC (reprint author), Duke Univ, Dept Biomed Engn, Durham, NC 27708 USA.",you@duke.edu,,"Buchler, Nicolas/0000-0003-3940-3432","National Science Foundation; National Institutes of Health [R01GM098642, R01GM110494]; DuPont Young Professorship; David and Lucile Packard Fellowship; DARPA Biochronicity Grant [DARPA-BAA-11-66]; NIH [DP2 OD008654-01]; Burroughs Wellcome Fund [BWF 1005769.01]","We thank S.

For biological networks such as transcription circuits, the nature of these constraints and their consequences are largely unknown. Here we describe the evolutionary pathways of a transcription network that controls the response to mating pheromone in yeast(9). A component of this network, the transcription regulator Ste12, has evolved two different modes of binding to a set of its target genes. In one group of species, Ste12 binds to specific DNA binding sites, while in another lineage it occupies DNA indirectly, relying on a second transcription regulator to recognize DNA. We show, through the construction of various possible evolutionary intermediates, that evolution of the direct mode of DNA binding was not directly accessible to the ancestor. Instead, it was contingent on a lineage-specific change to an overlapping transcription network with a different function, the specification of cell type. These results show that analysing and predicting the evolution of cis-regulatory regions requires an understanding of their positions in overlapping networks, as this placement constrains the available evolutionary pathways.","[Sorrells, Trevor R.; Booth, Lauren N.; Tuch, Brian B.; Johnson, Alexander D.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Microbiol & Immunol, Dept Biochem & Biophys, San Francisco, CA 94158 USA; [Sorrells, Trevor R.; Booth, Lauren N.; Johnson, Alexander D.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Tetrad Grad Program, San Francisco, CA 94158 USA; [Tuch, Brian B.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Biol & Med Informat Grad Program, San Francisco, CA 94158 USA","Johnson, AD (reprint author), Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Microbiol & Immunol, Dept Biochem & Biophys, San Francisco, CA 94158 USA.",ajohnson@cgl.ucsf.edu,,,National Institutes of Health [R01 GM037049]; National Science Foundation,"We thank S.

How the intasome interfaces with chromosomal DNA, which exists in the form of nucleosomal arrays, is currently unknown. Here we show that the prototype foamy virus (PFV) intasome is proficient at stable capture of nucleosomes as targets for integration. Single-particle cryo-electron microscopy reveals a multivalent intasome-nucleosome interface involving both gyres of nucleosomal DNA and one H2A-H2B heterodimer. While the histone octamer remains intact, the DNA is lifted from the surface of the H2A-H2B heterodimer to allow integration at strongly preferred superhelix location +/- 3.5 positions. Amino acid substitutions disrupting these contacts impinge on the ability of the intasome to engage nucleosomes in vitro and redistribute viral integration sites on the genomic scale. Our findings elucidate the molecular basis for nucleosome capture by the viral DNA recombination machinery and the underlying nucleosome plasticity that allows integration.","[Maskell, Daniel P.; Lesbats, Paul; Cherepanov, Peter] Francis Crick Inst, Chromatin Struct & Mobile DNA, S Mimms EN6 3LD, Herts, England; [Renault, Ludovic; Costa, Alessandro] Francis Crick Inst, Clare Hall Labs, Architecture & Dynam Macromol Machines, S Mimms EN6 3LD, Herts, England; [Renault, Ludovic] Natl Inst Biol Stand & Control Microscopy & Imagi, S Mimms EN6 3QG, Herts, England; [Serrao, Erik; Engelman, Alan N.] Dana Farber Canc Inst, Dept Canc Immunol & AIDS, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Matadeen, Rishi] Gorlaeus Lab, NeCEN, NL-2333 Leiden, Netherlands; [Hare, Stephen; Cherepanov, Peter] Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Div Med, London W2 1PG, England; [Lindemann, Dirk] Tech Univ Dresden, Inst Virol, D-01307 Dresden, Germany","Costa, A (reprint author), Francis Crick Inst, Clare Hall Labs, Architecture & Dynam Macromol Machines, Blanche Lane, S Mimms EN6 3LD, Herts, England.",alessandro.costa@crick.ac.uk; peter.cherepanov@crick.ac.uk,"; Cherepanov, Peter/F-6859-2010","Renault, Ludovic/0000-0001-6464-8808; Hare, Stephen/0000-0003-2951-1595; Cherepanov, Peter/0000-0002-0634-538X",European Union [305137]; US National Institute of General Medical Sciences [GM082251-06]; US National Institutes of Health [AI070042-08]; Netherlands Centre for Electron Nanoscopy (NeCEN); Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek [175.010.2009.001]; European Union's Regional Development Fund through 'Kansen voor West' [21Z.014],"This work was supported by the European Union FP7 HIVINNOV consortium grant 305137 (to P.C.), the US National Institute of General Medical Sciences P50 grant GM082251-06 (to P.C.) and the US National Institutes of Health R01 grant AI070042-08 (to A.N.E.).

Levels of GPC11 crExos correlate with tumour burden and the survival of pre-and post-surgical patients. GPC11 crExos from patients and from mice with spontaneous pancreatic tumours carry specific KRAS mutations, and reliably detect pancreatic intraepithelial lesions in mice despite negative signals by magnetic resonance imaging.

CK1 alpha is encoded by a gene within the common deleted region for del(5q) MDS and haploin sufficient expression sensitizes cells to lenalidomide therapy, providing a mechanistic basis for the therapeutic window of lenalidomide in del(5q) MDS. We found that mouse cells are resistant to lenalidomide but that changing a single amino acid in mouse Crbn to the corresponding human residue enables lenalidomide-dependent degradation of CK1 alpha. We further demonstrate that minor side chain modifications in thalidomide and a novel analogue, CC-122, can modulate the spectrum of substrates targeted by CRL4(CRBN).

They may originate in the explosion of stars with much larger radii than those producing normal long-duration gamma-ray bursts(3,4) or in the tidal disruption of a star(3). No clear supernova has yet been associated with an ultra-long-duration gamma-ray burst. Here we report that a supernova (SN 2011kl) was associated with the ultra-long-duration gamma-ray burst GRB 111209A, at a redshift z of 0.677. This supernova is more than three times more luminous than type Ic supernovae associated with long-duration gamma-ray bursts(5-7), and its spectrum is distinctly different. The slope of the continuum resembles those of super-luminous supernovae(8,9), but extends further down into the rest-frame ultraviolet implying a low metal content. The light curve evolves much more rapidly than those of super-luminous supernovae.

This interaction strongly influences the evolution of the radiation belts during a geomagnetic storm, and over the course of many hours to days helps to return the radiation-belt structure to its 'quiet' pre-storm configuration. Observations have shown that the long-term electron-loss rate is consistent with this theory but the temporal and spatial dynamics of the loss process remain to be directly verified. Here we report simultaneous measurements of structured radiation-belt electron losses and the hiss phenomenon that causes the losses. Losses were observed in the form of bremsstrahlung X-rays generated by hiss-scattered electrons colliding with the Earth's atmosphere after removal from the radiation belts. Our results show that changes of up to an order of magnitude in the dynamics of electron loss arising from hiss occur on timescales as short as one to twenty minutes, in association with modulations in plasma density and magnetic field. Furthermore, these loss dynamics are coherent with hiss dynamics on spatial scales comparable to the size of the plasmasphere. This nearly global-scale coherence was not predicted and may affect the short-term evolution of the radiation belts during active times.","[Breneman, A. W.; Wygant, J. R.; Cattell, C.

However, in synthetic disordered organic materials, the exciton diffusion length is typically only around 10 nanometres (refs 4, 5), or about 50 nanometres in exceptional cases(6,7), a distance that is largely determined by the probability laws of incoherent exciton hopping. Only for highly ordered organic systems has the transport of excitation energy over macroscopic distances been reported-for example, for triplet excitons in anthracene single crystals at room temperature(8), as well as along single polydiacetylene chains embedded in their monomer crystalline matrix at cryogenic temperatures (at 10 kelvin, or -263 degrees Celsius)(9). For supramolecular nanostructures, uniaxial long-range transport has not been demonstrated at room temperature. Here we show that individual self-assembled nanofibres with molecular-scale diameter efficiently transport singlet excitons at ambient conditions over more than four micrometres, a distance that is limited only by the fibre length. Our data suggest that this remarkable long-range transport is predominantly coherent. Such coherent long-range transport is achieved by one-dimensional self-assembly of supramolecular building blocks, based on carbonyl-bridged triarylamines10, into well defined H-type aggregates (in which individual monomers are aligned cofacially) with substantial electronic interactions. These findings may facilitate the development of organic nanophotonic devices and quantum information technology.","[Haedler, Andreas T.; Kreger, Klaus; Schmidt, Hans-Werner] Univ Bayreuth, Macromol Chem 1, Bayreuth Inst Macromol Res, D-95440 Bayreuth, Germany; [Haedler, Andreas T.; Kreger, Klaus; Schmidt, Hans-Werner] Univ Bayreuth, Bayreuth Ctr Colloids & Interfaces, D-95440 Bayreuth, Germany; [Issac, Abey; Wittmann, Bernd; Koehler, Juergen; Hildner, Richard] Univ Bayreuth, Expt Phys 4, D-95440 Bayreuth, Germany; [Issac, Abey; Wittmann, Bernd; Koehler, Juergen; Hildner, Richard] Univ Bayreuth, Bayreuth Inst Macromol Res, D-95440 Bayreuth, Germany; [Kivala, Milan; Hammer, Natalie] Univ Erlangen Nurnberg, Dept Chem & Pharm, Chair Organ Chem 1, D-91054 Erlangen, Germany","Hildner, R (reprint author), Univ Bayreuth, Expt Phys 4, D-95440 Bayreuth, Germany.",hans-werner.schmidt@uni-bayreuth.de; richard.hildner@uni-bayreuth.de,"Hildner, Richard/O-6386-2014; Kivala, Milan/D-2855-2012; Schmidt, Hans-Werner/J-1136-2014","Hildner, Richard/0000-0002-7282-3730; Schmidt, Hans-Werner/0000-0002-1761-1153; Kohler, Jurgen/0000-0002-4214-4008","Bavarian State Ministry of Science, Research, and the Arts for the Collaborative Research Network 'Solar Technologies go Hybrid'; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) [GRK1640, SFB953]; Cluster of Excellence 'Engineering of Advanced Materials' (EAM) at the University of Erlangen-Nurnberg; 'Macromolecular Science' elite study program at the University of Bayreuth; 'Elite Netzwerk Bayern' fellowship","We acknowledge financial support from the Bavarian State Ministry of Science, Research, and the Arts for the Collaborative Research Network 'Solar Technologies go Hybrid', the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) within projects GRK1640 (A.T.H., A.I., B.W., J.K., H.-W.S., R.H.)

Of these, iron has received considerable attention because of its role as an essential and often limiting nutrient for primary production in regions of the ocean that are of critical importance for the global carbon cycle(4). It has been thought that most of the dissolved iron discharged by hydrothermal vents is lost from solution close to ridge-axis sources(2,5) and is thus of limited importance for ocean biogeochemistry(6). This long-standing view is challenged by recent studies which suggest that stabilization of hydrothermal dissolved iron may facilitate its longrange oceanic transport(7-10). Such transport has been subsequently inferred from spatially limited oceanographic observations(11-13). Here we report data from the US GEOTRACES Eastern Pacific Zonal Transect (EPZT) that demonstrate lateral transport of hydrothermal dissolved iron, manganese, and aluminium from the southern East Pacific Rise (SEPR) several thousand kilometres westward across the South Pacific Ocean. Dissolved iron exhibits nearly conservative (that is, no loss from solution during transport and mixing) behaviour in this hydrothermal plume, implying a greater longevity in the deep ocean than previously assumed(6,14). Based on our observations, we estimate a global hydrothermal dissolved iron input of three to four gigamoles per year to the ocean interior, which is more than fourfold higher than previous estimates(7,11,14). Complementary simulations with a global-scale ocean biogeochemical model suggest that the observed transport of hydrothermal dissolved iron requires some means of physicochemical stabilization and indicate that hydrothermally derived iron sustains a large fraction of Southern Ocean export production.","[Resing, Joseph A.] Univ Washington, Joint Inst Study Atmosphere & Ocean, Seattle, WA 98115 USA; [Resing, Joseph A.] NOAA, PMEL, Seattle, WA 98115 USA; [Sedwick, Peter N.; Sohst, Bettina M.] Old Dominion Univ, Dept Ocean Earth & Atmospher Sci, Norfolk, VA 23529 USA; [German, Christopher R.; Jenkins, William J.] Woods Hole Oceanog Inst, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA; [Moffett, James W.] Univ So Calif, Dept Biol Sci, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA; [Tagliabue, Alessandro] Univ Liverpool, Sch Environm Sci, Dept Earth Ocean & Ecol Sci, Liverpool L69 3GP, Merseyside, England","Resing, JA (reprint author), Univ Washington, Joint Inst Study Atmosphere & Ocean, 7600 Sand Point Way NE, Seattle, WA 98115 USA.",resing@uw.edu; a.tagliabue@liverpool.ac.uk,"Resing, Joseph/J-6110-2017","Resing, Joseph/0000-0002-7334-4176; Tagliabue, Alessandro/0000-0002-3572-3634","US National Science Foundation [OCE-1237011, OCE-1237034, OCE-1232991, OCE-1130870, OCE-1131731, OCE-1260273]; N8 consortium; EPSRC [EP/K000225/1]; Humboldt Research Award; JISAO by the PMEL-Earth Oceans Interactions programme","We thank the captain and crew of the RV Thomas G.

A notable exception exists in single-celled eukaryotes called dinoflagellates, some of which have an eye-like 'ocelloid' consisting of subcellular analogues to a cornea, lens, iris, and retina(1). These planktonic cells are uncultivated and rarely encountered in environmental samples, obscuring the function and evolutionary origin of the ocelloid. Here we show, using a combination of electron microscopy, tomography, isolated-organelle genomics, and single-cell genomics, that ocelloids are built from pre-existing organelles, including a cornea-like layer made of mitochondria and a retinal body made of anastomosing plastids. We find that the retinal body forms the central core of a network of peridinin-type plastids, which in dinoflagellates and their relatives originated through an ancient endosymbiosis with a red alga(2). As such, the ocelloid is a chimaeric structure, incorporating organelles with different endosymbiotic histories. The anatomical complexity of single-celled organisms may be limited by the components available for differentiation, but the ocelloid shows that preexisting organelles can be assembled into a structure so complex that it was initially mistaken for a multicellular eye(3). Although mitochondria and plastids are acknowledged chiefly for their metabolic roles, they can also be building blocks for greater structural complexity.","[Gavelis, Gregory S.; Hayakawa, Shiho; Leander, Brian S.] Univ British Columbia, Dept Zool, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada; [Hayakawa, Shiho; Suttle, Curtis A.; Keeling, Patrick J.; Leander, Brian S.] Univ British Columbia, Dept Bot, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada; [Hayakawa, Shiho; Gojobori, Takashi] Natl Inst Genet, Ctr Informat Biol, Mishima, Shizuoka 4118540, Japan; [White, Richard A., III; Suttle, Curtis A.] Univ British Columbia, Dept Microbiol & Immunol, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada; [Gojobori, Takashi] King Abdullah Univ Sci & Technol, Computat Biosci Res Ctr, Thuwal 239556900, Saudi Arabia; [Suttle, Curtis A.] Univ British Columbia, Dept Earth Ocean & Atmospher Sci, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada; [Suttle, Curtis A.; Keeling, Patrick J.; Leander, Brian S.] Canadian Inst Adv Res, Toronto, ON M5G 1Z8, Canada","Gavelis, GS (reprint author), Univ British Columbia, Dept Zool, 6270 Univ Blvd, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada.",zoark0@gmail.com,,"Keeling, Patrick/0000-0002-7644-0745; Suttle, Curtis/0000-0002-0372-0033","Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada [2014-05258, 227301]; Tula Foundation (Centre for Microbial Diversity and Evolution)","This work was supported by grants from the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (2014-05258 to B.S.L., and 227301 to P.J.K.) and the Tula Foundation (Centre for Microbial Diversity and Evolution).

Genomic analyses of a few representatives suggested that metabolic limitations have prevented their cultivation(2-6). Here we reconstructed 8 complete and 789 draft genomes from bacteria representing >35 phyla and documented features that consistently distinguish these organisms from other bacteria. We infer that this group, which may comprise >(1)5% of the bacterial domain, has shared evolutionary history, and describe it as the candidate phyla radiation (CPR). All CPR genomes are small and most lack numerous biosynthetic pathways. Owing to divergent 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene sequences, 50-100% of organisms sampled from specific phyla would evade detection in typical cultivation-independent surveys. CPR organisms often have self-splicing introns and proteins encoded within their rRNA genes, a feature rarely reported in bacteria. Furthermore, they have unusual ribosome compositions. All are missing a ribosomal protein often absent in symbionts, and specific lineages are missing ribosomal proteins and biogenesis factors considered universal in bacteria. This implies different ribosome structures and biogenesis mechanisms, and underlines unusual biology across a large part of the bacterial domain.","[Brown, Christopher T.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Plant & Microbial Biol, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Hug, Laura A.; Thomas, Brian C.; Sharon, Itai; Castelle, Cindy J.; Singh, Andrea; Banfield, Jillian F.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Wilkins, Michael J.] Ohio State Univ, Sch Earth Sci, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Wilkins, Michael J.; Wrighton, Kelly C.] Ohio State Univ, Dept Microbiol, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Williams, Kenneth H.; Banfield, Jillian F.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Div Earth Sci, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Banfield, Jillian F.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Environm Sci Policy & Management, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA","Banfield, JF (reprint author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",jbanfield@berkeley.edu,"Wilkins, Michael/A-9358-2013; Williams, Kenneth/O-5181-2014","Williams, Kenneth/0000-0002-3568-1155; Wilkins, Michael/0000-0002-3595-0853","US Department of Energy (DOE), Office of Science, Office of Biological and Environmental Research [DE-AC02-05CH11231, DE-SC0004918]; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council postdoctoral fellowship; DOE","We thank J.

Surveys of DNA methylation in human tissues have established a complex landscape including both tissue-specific and invariant methylation patterns(1,2). Here we report high coverage methylomes that catalogue cytosine methylation in all contexts for the major human organ systems, integrated with matched transcriptomes and genomic sequence. By combining these diverse data types with each individuals' phased genome(3), we identified widespread tissue-specific differential CG methylation (mCG), partially methylated domains, allele-specific methylation and transcription, and the unexpected presence of non-CG methylation (mCH) in almost all human tissues. mCH correlated with tissue-specific functions, and using this mark, we made novel predictions of genes that escape X-chromosome inactivation in specific tissues. Overall, DNA methylation in several genomic contexts varies substantially among human tissues.","[Schultz, Matthew D.; He, Yupeng; Selvaraj, Siddarth] Univ Calif San Diego, Bioinformat Program, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Schultz, Matthew D.; He, Yupeng; Hariharan, Manoj; Nery, Joseph R.; Urich, Mark A.; Chen, Huaming; Ecker, Joseph R.] Salk Inst Biol Studies, Genom Anal Lab, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; [Whitaker, John W.; Wang, Wei] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Chem & Biochem, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Mukamel, Eran A.; Sejnowski, Terrence J.] Salk Inst Biol Studies, Computat Neurobiol Lab, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; [Mukamel, Eran A.] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Cognit Sci, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; [Leung, Danny; Rajagopal, Nisha; Jung, Inkyung; Schmitt, Anthony D.; Ren, Bing] Ludwig Inst Canc Res, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Lin, Shin] Stanford Univ, Dept Genet, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Lin, Yiing] Washington Univ, Sch Med, Dept Surg, St Louis, MO 63110 USA; [Ren, Bing] Univ Calif San Diego, Sch Med, Dept Cellular & Mol Med, Inst Genom Med, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Sejnowski, Terrence J.] Univ Calif San Diego, Div Biol Sci, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; [Sejnowski, Terrence J.; Ecker, Joseph R.] Salk Inst Biol Studies, Howard Hughes Med Inst, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; [Wang, Wei] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Cellular & Mol Med, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA","Ecker, JR (reprint author), Salk Inst Biol Studies, Genom Anal Lab, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA.",ecker@salk.edu,"Ecker, Joseph/B-9144-2008; Hariharan, Manoj/N-2855-2015","Ecker, Joseph/0000-0001-5799-5895; Hariharan, Manoj/0000-0002-1006-5372; Jung, Inkyung/0000-0002-5885-2754","National Institutes of Health (NIH) Epigenome Roadmap Project [U01 ES017166]; National Institute of Neurological Diseases and Stroke grant [R00NS080911]; Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation [GMBF3034]; Mary K.

The global circulation patterns of influenza A/H3N2 viruses are well characterized(1-7), but the patterns of A/H1N1 and B viruses have remained largely unexplored. Here we show that the global circulation patterns of A/H1N1 (up to 2009), B/Victoria, and B/Yamagata viruses differ substantially from those of A/H3N2 viruses, on the basis of analyses of 9,604 haemagglutinin sequences of human seasonal influenza viruses from 2000 to 2012. Whereas genetic variants of A/H3N2 viruses did not persist locally between epidemics and were reseeded from East and Southeast Asia, genetic variants of A/H1N1 and B viruses persisted across several seasons and exhibited complex global dynamics with East and Southeast Asia playing a limited role in disseminating new variants. The less frequent global movement of influenza A/H1N1 and B viruses coincided with slower rates of antigenic evolution, lower ages of infection, and smaller, less frequent epidemics compared to A/H3N2 viruses. Detailed epidemic models support differences in age of infection, combined with the less frequent travel of children, as probable drivers of the differences in the patterns of global circulation, suggesting a complex interaction between virus evolution, epidemiology, and human behaviour.","[Bedford, Trevor] Fred Hutchinson Canc Res Ctr, Vaccine & Infect Dis Div, Seattle, WA 98109 USA; [Riley, Steven] Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Infect Dis Epidemiol, MRC Ctr Outbreak Anal & Modelling, London SW7 2AZ, England; [Riley, Steven; Rambaut, Andrew] NIH, Fogarty Int Ctr, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Barr, Ian G.; Hurt, Aeron C.; Kelso, Anne] WHO, Collaborating Ctr Reference & Res Influenza, Melbourne, Vic 3000, Australia; [Broor, Shobha] SGT Med Coll Hosp & Res Inst, Gurgaon 122505, Haryana, India; [Chadha, Mandeep; Potdar, Varsha] Natl Inst Virol, Pune 411001, Maharashtra, India; [Cox, Nancy J.; Klimov, Alexander; Xu, Xiyan] Ctr Dis Control & Prevent, WHO Collaborating Ctr Reference & Res Influenza, Atlanta, GA 30329 USA; [Daniels, Rodney S.; McCauley, John W.] Natl Inst Med Res, MRC, WHO Collaborating Ctr Reference & Res Influenza, London NW7 1AA, England; [Gunasekaran, C.

The TH17 lineage of T helper (TH) cells can cause severe human inflammatory diseases. These cells exhibit both instability (they can cease to express their signature cytokine, IL-17A)(1) and plasticity (they can start expressing cytokines typical of other lineages)(1,2) upon in vitro re-stimulation. However, technical limitations have prevented the transcriptional profiling of pre- and post-conversion TH17 cells ex vivo during immune responses. Thus, it is unknown whether TH17 cell plasticity merely reflects change in expression of a few cytokines, or if TH17 cells physiologically undergo global genetic reprogramming driving their conversion from one T helper cell type to another, a process known as transdifferentiation(3,4). Furthermore, although TH17 cell instability/plasticity has been associated with pathogenicity(1,2,5), it is unknown whether this could present a therapeutic opportunity, whereby formerly pathogenic TH17 cells could adopt an anti-inflammatory fate. Here we used two new fate-mapping mouse models to track TH17 cells during immune responses to show that CD4(+) T cells that formerly expressed IL-17A go on to acquire an anti-inflammatory phenotype. The transdifferentiation of TH17 into regulatory T cells was illustrated by a change in their signature transcriptional profile and the acquisition of potent regulatory capacity. Comparisons of the transcriptional profiles of pre-and post-conversion TH17 cells also revealed a role for canonical TGF-beta signalling and consequently for the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) in conversion. Thus, TH17 cells transdifferentiate into regulatory cells, and contribute to the resolution of inflammation. Our data suggest that TH17 cell instability and plasticity is a therapeutic opportunity for inflammatory diseases.","[Gagliani, Nicola; Vesely, Maria Carolina Amezcua; Iseppon, Andrea; Xu, Hao; Palm, Noah W.; de Zoete, Marcel R.; Licona-Limon, Paula; Paiva, Ricardo S.; Flavell, Richard A.] Yale Univ, Sch Med, Dept Immunobiol, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Brockmann, Leonie; Huber, Samuel] Univ Klinikum Hamburg Eppendorf, Med Klin & Poliklin, D-20246 Hamburg, Germany; [de Zoete, Marcel R.; Flavell, Richard A.] Yale Univ, Sch Med, Howard Hughes Med Inst, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Ching, Travers; Garmire, Lana X.] Univ Hawaii, Ctr Canc, Manoa, HI 96813 USA; [Weaver, Casey] Univ Alabama Birmingham, Dept Pathol, Birmingham, AL 35294 USA; [Zi, Xiaoyuan; Fan, Rong] Yale Univ, Dept Biomed Engn, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Pan, Xinghua] Yale Univ, Sch Med, Dept Genet, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Cotton, Matthew J.; Drier, Yotam; Bernstein, Bradley] Howard Hughes Med Inst, Boston, MA 02114 USA; [Cotton, Matthew J.; Drier, Yotam; Bernstein, Bradley] Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Dept Pathol, Boston, MA 02114 USA; [Cotton, Matthew J.; Drier, Yotam; Bernstein, Bradley] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Boston, MA 02114 USA; [Geginat, Jens] Ist Nazl Genet Mol Romeo & Enrica Invernizzi, I-20122 Milan, Italy; [Stockinger, Brigitta] MRCNat Inst Med Res, Div Mol Immunol, London NW7 1AA, England; [Esplugues, Enric] Icahn Sch Med Mt Sinai, Mt Sinai Sch Med, Immunol Inst, New York, NY 10029 USA","Flavell, RA (reprint author), Yale Univ, Sch Med, Dept Immunobiol, 333 Cedar St, New Haven, CT 06520 USA.",s.huber@uke.de; richard.flavell@yale.edu,"Drier, Yotam/K-5208-2012","Drier, Yotam/0000-0003-1725-2995; Esplugues, Enric/0000-0002-8130-0413","NIH/BD2K [K01ES025434]; NIH/NIGMS [P20 COBRE GM103457]; DFG [EXC 257 NeuroCure, SFB633, HU1714/3]; Crohn's & Colitis Foundation of America [311143]; Dr. Keith Landesman Memorial Fellowship of the Cancer Research Institute; Ernst Jung-Stiftung Hamburg; Howard Hughes Medical Institute; Cariplo foundation [2013-0937]; AbbVie-Yale Collaboration; Francis Crick Institute","The authors would like to thank C.

However, fate mapping of these cycling cardiomyocytes has not been possible thus far owing to the lack of identifiable genetic markers(6). In several organs, stem or progenitor cells reside in relatively hypoxic microenvironments where the stabilization of the hypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha (Hif-1 alpha) subunit is critical for their maintenance and function(7-10). Here we report fate mapping of hypoxic cells and their progenies by generating a transgenic mouse expressing a chimaeric protein in which the oxygen-dependent degradation (ODD) domain of Hif-1 alpha is fused to the tamoxifen-inducible CreERT2 recombinase. In mice bearing the creERT2-ODD transgene driven by either the ubiquitous CAG promoter or the cardiomyocyte-specific a myosin heavy chain promoter, we identify a rare population of hypoxic cardiomyocytes that display characteristics of proliferative neonatal cardiomyocytes, such as smaller size, mononucleation and lower oxidative DNA damage. Notably, these hypoxic cardiomyocytes contributed widely to new cardiomyocyte formation in the adult heart. These results indicate that hypoxia signalling is an important hallmark of cycling cardiomyocytes, and suggest that hypoxia fate mapping can be a powerful tool for identifying cycling cells in adult mammals.","[Kimura, Wataru; Xiao, Feng; Canseco, Diana C.; Muralidhar, Shalini; Thet, SuWannee; Abderrahman, Yezan; Chen, Rui; Garcia, Joseph A.; Shelton, John M.; Ashour, Abdelrahman M.; Sadek, Hesham A.] Univ Texas SW Med Ctr Dallas, Div Cardiol, Dept Internal Med, Dallas, TX 75390 USA; [Kimura, Wataru] Univ Tsukuba, Tsukuba Adv Res Alliance, Life Sci Ctr, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058577, Japan; [Zhang, Helen M.; Lu, Zhigang; Zhang, Cheng Cheng] Univ Texas SW Med Ctr Dallas, Dept Physiol, Dallas, TX 75390 USA; [Zhang, Helen M.; Lu, Zhigang; Zhang, Cheng Cheng] Univ Texas SW Med Ctr Dallas, Dept Dev Biol, Dallas, TX 75390 USA; [Garcia, Joseph A.] VA North Texas Hlth Care Syst, Dept Med, Dallas, TX 75216 USA; [Richardson, James A.] Univ Texas SW Med Ctr Dallas, Dept Mol Biol, Dallas, TX 75390 USA; [Richardson, James A.] Univ Texas SW Med Ctr Dallas, Dept Pathol, Dallas, TX 75390 USA; [Asaithamby, Aroumougame] Univ Texas SW Med Ctr Dallas, Dept Radiat Oncol, Dallas, TX 75390 USA; [Liang, Hanquan; Xing, Chao] Univ Texas SW Med Ctr Dallas, McDermott Ctr Human Growth & Dev, Dallas, TX 75390 USA; [Sadek, Hesham A.] Univ Texas SW Med Ctr Dallas, Hamon Ctr Regenerat Sci & Med, Dallas, TX 75390 USA","Sadek, HA (reprint author), Univ Texas SW Med Ctr Dallas, Div Cardiol, Dept Internal Med, Dallas, TX 75390 USA.",hesham.sadek@utsouthwestern.edu,,"Xing, Chao/0000-0002-1838-0502",BLRD VA [I01 BX000446]; NHLBI NIH HHS [R01 HL108104],,,29,57,58,8,40,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,9-Jul,2015,523,7559,,,,,226,U243,,10.1038/nature14582,,18,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,CM4ZO,WOS:000357695900038,26098368,No,Y,N,11/19/17

These strategies include blockade of immune-inhibitory receptors on activated T cells; for example, using monoclonal antibodies against CTLA-4, PD-1, and PD-L1 (refs 3-5). However, only a subset of patients responds to these treatments, and data suggest that therapeutic benefit is preferentially achieved in patients with a pre-existing T-cell response against their tumour, as evidenced by a baseline CD8(+) T-cell infiltration within the tumour microenvironment(6,7). Understanding the molecular mechanisms that underlie the presence or absence of a spontaneous anti-tumour T-cell response in subsets of cases, therefore, should enable the development of therapeutic solutions for patients lacking a T-cell infiltrate. Here we identify a melanoma-cell-intrinsic oncogenic pathway that contributes to a lack of T-cell infiltration in melanoma. Molecular analysis of human metastatic melanoma samples revealed a correlation between activation of the WNT/beta-catenin signalling pathway and absence of a T-cell gene expression signature. Using autochthonous mouse melanoma models(8,9) we identified the mechanism by which tumour-intrinsic active beta-catenin signalling results in T-cell exclusion and resistance to anti-PD-L1/anti-CTLA-4 monoclonal antibody therapy. Specific oncogenic signals, therefore, can mediate cancer immune evasion and resistance to immunotherapies, pointing to new candidate targets for immune potentiation.","[Spranger, Stefani; Gajewski, Thomas F.] Univ Chicago, Dept Pathol, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Bao, Riyue] Univ Chicago, Ctr Res Informat, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Gajewski, Thomas F.] Univ Chicago, Dept Med, Chicago, IL 60637 USA","Gajewski, TF (reprint author), Univ Chicago, Dept Pathol, 5841 S Maryland Ave, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.",tgajewsk@medicine.bsd.uchicago.edu,,,Team Science Award from the Melanoma Research Alliance; Translational Research Grant from the Cancer Research Institute; German Research Foundation,"The authors would like to thank A.

Whereas eukaryotes use cyclins and cyclin-dependent kinases to balance division with cell fate decisions(1), equivalent regulatory systems have not been described in bacteria. Moreover, the mechanisms used by bacteria to tune division in line with developmental programs are poorly understood. Here we show that Caulobacter crescentus, a bacterium with an asymmetric division cycle, uses oscillating levels of the second messenger cyclic diguanylate (c-di-GMP) to drive its cell cycle. We demonstrate that c-diGMP directly binds to the essential cell cycle kinase CckA to inhibit kinase activity and stimulate phosphatase activity. An upshift of c-di-GMP during the G1-S transition switches CckA from the kinase to the phosphatase mode, thereby allowing replication initiation and cell cycle progression. Finally, we show that during division, c-di-GMP imposes spatial control on CckA to install the replication asymmetry of future daughter cells. These studies reveal c-di-GMP to be a cyclin-like molecule in bacteria that coordinates chromosome replication with cell morphogenesis in Caulobacter. The observation that c-di-GMP-mediated control is conserved in the plant pathogen Agrobacterium tumefaciens suggests a general mechanism through which this global regulator of bacterial virulence and persistence coordinates behaviour and cell proliferation.","[Lori, C.; Ozaki, S.; Steiner, S.; Abel, S.; Jenal, U.] Univ Basel, Biozentrum, Focal Area Infect Biol, CH-4056 Basel, Switzerland; [Boehm, R.; Dubey, B.

Here we perform genome-wide chromosome conformation capture analysis, fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH), and RNA-seq to obtain comprehensive three-dimensional (3D) maps of the Caenorhabditis elegans genome and to dissect X chromosome dosage compensation, which balances gene expression between XX hermaphrodites and XO males. The dosage compensation complex (DCC), a condensin complex, binds to both hermaphrodite X chromosomes via sequence-specific recruitment elements on X (rex sites) to reduce chromosome-wide gene expression by half(3-7). Most DCC condensin subunits also act in other condensin complexes to control the compaction and resolution of all mitotic and meiotic chromosomes(5,6). By comparing chromosome structure in wild-type and DCC-defective embryos, we show that the DCC remodels hermaphrodite X chromosomes into a sex-specific spatial conformation distinct from autosomes. Dosage-compensated X chromosomes consist of self-interacting domains (similar to 1 Mb) resembling mammalian topologically associating domains (TADs)(8,9). TADs on X chromosomes have stronger boundaries andmore regular spacing than on autosomes. Many TAD boundaries on X chromosomes coincide with the highest-affinity rex sites and become diminished or lost in DCC-defective mutants, thereby converting the topology of X to a conformation resembling autosomes. rex sites engage in DCC-dependent long-range interactions, with the most frequent interactions occurring between rex sites at DCC-dependent TAD boundaries. These results imply that the DCC reshapes the topology of X chromosomes by forming new TAD boundaries and reinforcing weak boundaries through interactions between its highest-affinity binding sites. As this model predicts, deletion of an endogenous rex site at a DCC-dependent TAD boundary using CRISPR/Cas9 greatly diminished the boundary. Thus, the DCC imposes a distinct higher-order structure onto X chromosomes while regulating gene expression chromosome-wide.","[Crane, Emily; Bian, Qian; Wheeler, Bayly S.; Ralston, Edward J.; Uzawa, Satoru; Meyer, Barbara J.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Crane, Emily; Bian, Qian; Wheeler, Bayly S.; Ralston, Edward J.; Uzawa, Satoru; Meyer, Barbara J.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mol & Cell Biol, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [McCord, Rachel Patton; Lajoie, Bryan R.; Dekker, Job] Univ Massachusetts, Sch Med, Program Syst Biol, Dept Biochem & Mol Pharmacol, Worcester, MA 01605 USA","Meyer, BJ (reprint author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",Job.Dekker@umassmed.edu; bjmeyer@berkeley.edu,,,NIGMS [R01 GM030702]; NHGRI [R01 HG003143],"We thank D.

The tri-snRNP combines with a precursor messenger RNA substrate bound to U1 and U2 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particles (snRNPs), and transforms into a catalytically active spliceosome after extensive compositional and conformational changes triggered by unwinding of the U4 and U6 (U4/U6) snRNAs. Here we use cryo-electron microscopy single-particle reconstruction of Saccharomyces cerevisiae tri-snRNP at 5.9 angstrom resolution to reveal the essentially complete organization of its RNA and protein components. The single-stranded region of U4 snRNA between its 39 stem-loop and the U4/U6 snRNA stem I is loaded into the Brr2 helicase active site ready for unwinding.

DNA damage response signalling pathways coordinate these processes, partly by propagating gene-expression-modulating signals. DNA damage influences not only the abundance of messenger RNAs, but also their coding information through alternative splicing. Here we show that transcription-blocking DNA lesions promote chromatin displacement of late-stage spliceosomes and initiate a positive feedback loop centred on the signalling kinase ATM. We propose that initial spliceosome displacement and subsequent R-loop formation is triggered by pausing of RNA polymerase at DNA lesions. In turn, R-loops activate ATM, which signals to impede spliceosome organization further and augment ultraviolet-irradiation-triggered alternative splicing at the genome-wide level. Our findings define R-loop-dependent ATM activation by transcription-blocking lesions as an important event in the DNA damage response of non-replicating cells, and highlight a key role for spliceosome displacement in this process.","[Tresini, Maria; Snijder, Loes; Hoeijmakers, Jan H.

Still forming under the action of gravitational instability, they grow in mass by accretion of supersonic flows. These flows partially dissipate into heat through a complex network of large-scale shocks(1), while residual transonic (near-sonic) flows create giant turbulent eddies and cascades(2,3). Turbulence heats the intra-cluster medium(4) and also amplifies magnetic energy by way of dynamo action(5-8). However, the pattern regulating the transformation of gravitational energy into kinetic, thermal, turbulent and magnetic energies remains unknown. Here we report that the energy components of the intra-cluster medium are ordered according to a permanent hierarchy, in which the ratio of thermal to turbulent to magnetic energy densities remains virtually unaltered throughout the cluster's history, despite evolution of each individual component and the drive towards equipartition of the turbulent dynamo. This result revolves around the approximately constant efficiency of turbulence generation from the gravitational energy that is freed during mass accretion, revealed by our computational model of cosmological structure formation(3,9). The permanent character of this hierarchy reflects yet another type of self-similarity in cosmology(10-13), while its structure, consistent with current data(14-18), encodes information about the efficiency of turbulent heating and dynamo action.","[Miniati, Francesco] ETH, Dept Phys, CH-8093 Zurich, Switzerland; [Beresnyak, Andrey] KTH Royal Inst Technol, Nordita, SE-10691 Stockholm, Sweden; [Beresnyak, Andrey] Stockholm Univ, SE-10691 Stockholm, Sweden","Miniati, F (reprint author), ETH, Dept Phys, Wolfgang Pauli Str 27, CH-8093 Zurich, Switzerland.",fm@phys.ethz.ch,,,"Swiss National Supercomputing Center (CSCS) [S419, S506]",This work was supported by a grant from the Swiss National Supercomputing Center (CSCS) under project IDs S419 and S506.,,36,18,18,2,19,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,2-Jul,2015,523,7558,,,,,59,+,,10.1038/nature14552,,7,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,CL7RN,WOS:000357169500030,26135447,No,,,11/19/17

It has been argued that cometary pits are a signature of endogenic activity, rather than impact craters such as those on planetary and asteroid surfaces. Impact experiments(5,6) andmodels(7,8) cannot reproduce the shapes of most of the observed cometary pits, and the predicted collision rates imply that few of the pits are related to impacts(8,9). Alternative mechanisms like explosive activity(10) have been suggested, but the driving process remains unknown. Here we report that pits on comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko are active, and probably created by a sinkhole process, possibly accompanied by outbursts. We argue that after formation, pits expand slowly in diameter, owing to sublimation-driven retreat of the walls. Therefore, pits characterize how eroded the surface is: a fresh cometary surface will have a ragged structure with many pits, while an evolved surface will look smoother. The size and spatial distribution of pits imply that large heterogeneities exist in the physical, structural or compositional properties of the first few hundred metres below the current nucleus surface.","[Vincent, Jean-Baptiste; Sierks, Holger; Agarwal, Jessica; A'Hearn, Michael F.; Gutierrez-Marques, P.; Guettler, Carsten; Hoekzema, Nick; Hoefner, Sebastian; Kovacs, Gabor; Kramm, Rainer; Oklay, Nilda; Pajola, Maurizio; Tubiana, Cecilia] Max Planck Inst Sonnensyst Forsch, D-37077 Gottingen, Germany; [Bodewits, Dennis; A'Hearn, Michael F.; Guilbert-Lepoutre, Aurelie] Univ Maryland, Dept Astron, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Besse, Sebastien; Koschny, Detlef] European Space Res & Technol Ctr ESA, Sci Support Off, NL-2201 AZ Noordwijk, Netherlands; [Barbieri, Cesare; La Forgia, Fiorangela; Lazzarin, Monica] Univ Padua, Dept Phys & Astron, I-35122 Padua, Italy; [Lamy, Philippe; Auger, Anne-Therese; Capanna, Claire; Groussin, Olivier; Jorda, Laurent] CNRS, Lab Astrophys Marseille, UMR 7326, F-13388 Marseille 13, France; [Lamy, Philippe; Auger, Anne-Therese; Capanna, Claire; Groussin, Olivier; Jorda, Laurent] Aix Marseille Univ, F-13388 Marseille 13, France; [Rodrigo, Rafael; Davidsson, Bjoern] CSIC, INTA, Ctr Astrobiol, Madrid 28850, Spain; [Rodrigo, Rafael] Int Space Sci Inst, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland; [Rickman, Hans] Uppsala Univ, Dept Phys & Astron, S-75120 Uppsala, Sweden; [Rickman, Hans] PAS Space Res Ctr, PL-00716 Warsaw, Poland; [Keller, Horst Uwe] Tech Univ Carolo Wilhelmina Braunschweig, IGEP, D-38106 Braunschweig, Germany; [A'Hearn, Michael F.] Akad Wissensch Gottingen, D-37077 Gottingen, Germany; [Barucci, M.

Although sophisticated instruments with impressive performance characteristics are available, much effort continues to be invested in the development of miniaturized, cheap and easy-to-use systems(1-13). Current microspectrometer designs mostly use interference filters(2-5) and interferometric optics(3) that limit their photon efficiency, resolution and spectral range(2,3). Here we show that many of these limitations can be overcome by replacing interferometric optics with a two-dimensional absorptive filter array composed of colloidal quantum dots(14-17). Instead of measuring different bands of a spectrum individually after introducing temporal or spatial separations with gratings or interference-based narrow-band filters, a colloidal quantum dot spectrometer measures a light spectrum based on the wavelength multiplexing principle(18): multiple spectral bands are encoded and detected simultaneously with one filter and one detector(9-12), respectively, with the array format allowing the process to be efficiently repeated many times using different filters with different encoding so that sufficient information is obtained to enable computational reconstruction of the target spectrum. We illustrate the performance of such a quantum dot microspectrometer, made from 195 different types of quantum dots with absorption features that cover a spectral range of 300 nanometres, by measuring shifts in spectral peak positions as small as one nanometre. Given this performance, demonstrable avenues for further improvement, the ease with which quantum dots can be processed and integrated, and their numerous finely tuneable bandgaps that cover a broad spectral range, we expect that quantum dot micro-spectrometers will be useful in applications where minimizing size, weight, cost and complexity of the spectrometer are critical.","[Bao, Jie] Tsinghua Univ, Dept Elect Engn, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China; [Bao, Jie; Bawendi, Moungi G.] MIT, Dept Chem, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Bao, Jie] CALTECH, Dept Phys, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA","Bao, J (reprint author), Tsinghua Univ, Dept Elect Engn, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China.",bao@tsinghua.edu.cn,,,"ARO through the Institute for Soldier Nanotechnologies [W911NF-07-D-0004]; Tsinghua University; Division of Physics, Mathematics and Astronomy at the California Institute of Technology","The inception, experiments and initial analysis in this work was funded by the ARO through the Institute for Soldier Nanotechnologies (W911NF-07-D-0004).

Recent developments in dynamical methods offer promise to improve seasonal NAO predictions(6), but assessing potential predictability on multi-annual timescales requires documentation of past low-frequency variability in the NAO. A recent bi-proxy NAO reconstruction(7) spanning the past millennium suggested that long-lasting positive NAO conditions were established during medieval times, explaining the particularly warm conditions in Europe during this period; however, these conclusions are debated. Here, we present a yearly NAO reconstruction for the past millennium, based on an initial selection of 48 annually resolved proxy records distributed around the Atlantic Ocean and built through an ensemble of multivariate regressions. We validate the approach in six past-millenniumclimate simulations, and show that our reconstruction outperforms the bi-proxy index. The final reconstruction shows no persistent positive NAO during the medieval period, but suggests that positive phases were dominant during the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries. The reconstruction also reveals that a positive NAO emerges two years after strong volcanic eruptions, consistent with results obtained from models and satellite observations for the Mt Pinatubo eruption in the Philippines(8,9).","[Ortega, Pablo; Masson-Delmotte, Valerie; Casado, Mathieu; Yiou, Pascal] CEA Saclay, UMR CEA CNRS UVSQ 8212, LSCE IPSL, F-91191 Gif Sur Yvette, France; [Lehner, Flavio; Raible, Christoph C.] Univ Bern, Inst Phys, Climate & Environm Phys, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland; [Lehner, Flavio; Raible, Christoph C.] Univ Bern, Oeschger Ctr Climate Change Res, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland; [Swingedouw, Didier] Univ Bordeaux 1, EPOC, F-33615 Pessac, France","Ortega, P (reprint author), Univ Reading, Dept Meteorol, NCAS Climate, Reading RG6 6BB, Berks, England.",pablo.ortega@lsce.ipsl.fr,"Masson-Delmotte, Valerie/G-1995-2011; Raible, Christoph/M-8309-2016; Ortega, Pablo/B-2829-2017; Swingedouw, Didier/D-1408-2010","Masson-Delmotte, Valerie/0000-0001-8296-381X; Raible, Christoph/0000-0003-0176-0602; Ortega, Pablo/0000-0002-4135-9621; Swingedouw, Didier/0000-0002-0583-0850; Casado, Mathieu/0000-0002-8185-415X",French ANR CEPS project Green Greenland [ANR-10-CEPL-0008]; NCCR-Climate - Swiss National Science Foundation [200020 147174]; Swedish Research Council [C0629701],"The work of P.O., D.S., V.M.-D. and M.C. has been financially supported by the French ANR CEPS project Green Greenland (ANR-10-CEPL-0008).

Vertebrates display contrasting strategies ranging from complete genetic control of sex (genotypic sex determination) to environmentally determined sex (for example, temperature-dependent sex determination)(1). Phylogenetic analyses suggest frequent evolutionary transitions between genotypic and temperature-dependent sex determination in environmentally sensitive lineages, including reptiles(2). These transitions are thought to involve a genotypic system becoming sensitive to temperature, with sex determined by gene-environment interactions(3). Most mechanistic models of transitions invoke a role for sex reversal(3-5). Sex reversal has not yet been demonstrated in nature for any amniote, although it occurs in fish(6) and rarely in amphibians(7,8). Here we make the first report of reptile sex reversal in the wild, in the Australian bearded dragon (Pogona vitticeps), and use sex-reversed animals to experimentally induce a rapid transition from genotypic to temperature-dependent sex determination. Controlled mating of normal males to sex-reversed females produces viable and fertile offspring whose phenotypic sex is determined solely by temperature (temperature-dependent sex determination). The W sex chromosome is eliminated from this lineage in the first generation. The instantaneous creation of a lineage of ZZ temperature-sensitive animals reveals a novel, climate-induced pathway for the rapid transition between genetic and temperature-dependent sex determination, and adds to concern about adaptation to rapid global climate change.","[Holleley, Clare E.; O'Meally, Denis; Sarre, Stephen D.; Graves, Jennifer A.

ELEGANS; HOMEODOMAIN PROTEIN; MOTOR-NEURONS; GABA RECEPTOR; IDENTIFICATION; TRANSMISSION; MOTONEURON; ENCODES,"Synapse formation is a process tightly controlled in space and time. How gene regulatory mechanisms specify spatial and temporal aspects of synapse formation is not well understood. In the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, two subtypes of the D-type inhibitory motor neuron (MN) classes, the dorsal D (DD) and ventral D (VD) neurons, extend axons along both the dorsal and ventral nerve cords(1). The embryonically generated DD motor neurons initially innervate ventral muscles in the first (L1) larval stage and receive their synaptic input from cholinergic motor neurons in the dorsal cord. They rewire by the end of the L1 moult to innervate dorsal muscles and to be innervated by newly formed ventral cholinergic motor neurons(1). VD motor neurons develop after the L1 moult; they take over the innervation of ventral muscles and receive their synaptic input from dorsal cholinergic motor neurons. We show here that the spatiotemporal control of synaptic wiring of the D-type neurons is controlled by an intersectional transcriptional strategy in which the UNC-30 Pitx-type homeodomain transcription factor acts together, in embryonic and early larval stages, with the temporally controlled LIN-14 transcription factor to prevent premature synapse rewiring of the DD motor neurons and, together with the UNC-55 nuclear hormone receptor, to prevent aberrant VD synaptic wiring in later larval and adult stages. A key effector of this intersectional transcription factor combination is a novel synaptic organizer molecule, the single immunoglobulin domain protein OIG-1. OIG-1 is perisynaptically localized along the synaptic outputs of the D-type motor neurons in a temporally controlled manner and is required for appropriate selection of both pre-and post-synaptic partners.","[Howell, Kelly; Hobert, Oliver] Columbia Univ, Dept Biochem & Mol Biophys, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Med Ctr, New York, NY 10032 USA; [White, John G.] MRC, Mol Biol Lab, Cambridge CB2 2QH, England","Howell, K (reprint author), Columbia Univ, Dept Biochem & Mol Biophys, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Med Ctr, 630 W 168th St, New York, NY 10032 USA.",kh2512@columbia.edu; or38@columbia.edu,,,"National Institutes of Health [R01NS039996-05, R01NS050266-03]; Howard Hughes Medical Institute; UK Medical Research Council","We thank the TransgeneOme project, the CGC, J.

However, patterns also form in cell populations exposed to the same signalling molecules and substratum, which often correlate with specific features of the population context of single cells, such as local cell crowding(3). Here we reveal a cell-intrinsic molecular mechanism that allows multicellular patterning without requiring specific communication between cells. It acts by sensing the local crowding of a single cell through its ability to spread and activate focal adhesion kinase (FAK, also known as PTK2), resulting in adaptation of genes controlling membrane homeostasis. In cells experiencing low crowding, FAK suppresses transcription of the ABC transporter A1 (ABCA1) by inhibiting FOXO3 and TAL1. Agent-based computational modelling and experimental confirmation identified membrane-based signalling and feedback control as crucial for the emergence of population patterns of ABCA1 expression, which adapts membrane lipid composition to cell crowding and affects multiple signalling activities, including the suppression of ABCA1 expression itself. The simple design of this cell-intrinsic system and its broad impact on the signalling state of mammalian single cells suggests a fundamental role for a tunable membrane lipid composition in collective cell behaviour.","[Frechin, Mathieu; Stoeger, Thomas; Daetwyler, Stephan; Battich, Nico; Pelkmans, Lucas] Univ Zurich, Inst Mol Life Sci, Fac Sci, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland; [Stoeger, Thomas; Battich, Nico] ETH, Life Sci Zurich Grad Sch, PhD Program Syst Biol, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland; [Stoeger, Thomas; Battich, Nico] Univ Zurich, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland; [Gehin, Charlotte; Riezman, Howard] Univ Geneva, Dept Biochem, CH-1205 Geneva, Switzerland; [Damm, Eva-Maria; Stergiou, Lilli] ETH, Inst Mol Syst Biol, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland","Pelkmans, L (reprint author), Univ Zurich, Inst Mol Life Sci, Fac Sci, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland.",lucas.pelkmans@imls.uzh.ch,,"Mathieu, FRECHIN/0000-0003-2385-5688; Riezman, Howard/0000-0003-4680-9422; Gehin, Charlotte/0000-0003-1164-2968",EMBO; Marie Curie fellowship [301650]; Oncosuisse fellowship; Bonizzi Theler fellowship; University of Zurich; SystemsX.ch RTD Project LipidX,"We thank B.

Here we explore the contribution of the mechanical pressure exerted by tumour growth onto non-tumorous adjacent epithelium. In the early stage of mouse colon tumour development in the Notch(+)Apc(+/1638N) mouse model, we observed mechanistic pressure stress in the non-tumorous epithelial cells caused by hyper-proliferative adjacent crypts overexpressing active Notch, which is associated with increased Ret and beta-catenin signalling. We thus developed a method that allows the delivery of a defined mechanical pressure in vivo, by subcutaneously inserting a magnet close to the mouse colon. The implanted magnet generated a magnetic force on ultra-magnetic liposomes, stabilized in the mesenchymal cells of the connective tissue surrounding colonic crypts after intravenous injection. The magnetically induced pressure quantitatively mimicked the endogenous early tumour growth stress in the order of 1,200 Pa, without affecting tissue stiffness, as monitored by ultrasound strain imaging and shear wave elastography. The exertion of pressure mimicking that of tumour growth led to rapid Ret activation and downstream phosphorylation of beta-catenin on Tyr654, imparing its interaction with the E-cadherin in adherens junctions, and which was followed by beta-catenin nuclear translocation after 15 days. As a consequence, increased expression of beta-catenin-target genes was observed at 1 month, together with crypt enlargement accompanying the formation of early tumorous aberrant crypt foci. Mechanical activation of the tumorigenic beta-catenin pathway suggests unexplored modes of tumour propagation based on mechanical signalling pathways in healthy epithelial cells surrounding the tumour, which may contribute to tumour heterogeneity.","[Fernandez-Sanchez, Maria Elena; Barbier, Sandrine; Whitehead, Joanne; Farge, Emmanuel] PSL Res Univ, Fdn Pierre Gilles Gennes, CNRS UMR Physicochim Curie Mech & Genet Embryon &, Inst Curie,Ctr Rech,INSERM, F-75005 Paris, France; [Bealle, Gaelle; Michel, Aude; Menager, Christine] Univ Paris 04, UPMC, Lab PHENIX Physicochim Electrolytes & Nanosyst In, CNRS UMR 8234, F-75005 Paris, France; [Latorre-Ossa, Heldmuth; Gennisson, Jean-Luc; Tanter, Mickael] PSL Res Univ, Waves & Images ESPCI ParisTech, Langevin Inst, CNRS UMR7587,Inserm U979, F-75005 Paris, France; [Rey, Colette; Fouassier, Laura; Claperon, Audrey; Housset, Chantal] Univ Paris 04, UPMC, F-75012 Paris, France; [Rey, Colette; Fouassier, Laura; Claperon, Audrey; Housset, Chantal] INSERM, UMR S 938, CDR St Antoine, F-75012 Paris, France; [Brulle, Laura] Inst Curie, Ctr Rech, CNRS UMR3666, INSERM Endocyt Trafficking & Therapeut Delivery U, F-75005 Paris, France; [Girard, Elodie; Servant, Nicolas] Inst Curie, MINES ParisTech, Bioinformat Platform, U900, F-75005 Paris, France; [Rio-Frio, Thomas] Inst Curie, Next Generat Sequencing Platform, F-75005 Paris, France; [Marie, Helene; Lesieur, Sylviane] Univ Paris 11, Lab Physicochim Syst Polyphases, Fac Pharm, CNRS UMR 8612,Inst Galien Paris Sud,LabEx LERMIT, F-92296 Chatenay Malabry, France; [Fre, Silvia] Inst Curie, Unite Genet & Biol Dev, Notch Signaling Stem Cells & Tumors, CNRS UMR 3215,INSERM U934,Ctr Rech, F-75005 Paris, France; [Robine, Sylvie] Inst Curie, Ctr Rech, CNRS Compartimentat & Dynam Cellulaires Morphogen, F-75005 Paris, France","Farge, E (reprint author), PSL Res Univ, Fdn Pierre Gilles Gennes, CNRS UMR Physicochim Curie Mech & Genet Embryon &, Inst Curie,Ctr Rech,INSERM, F-75005 Paris, France.",efarge@curie.fr,"Tanter, Mickael/H-4657-2012; Farge, Emmanuel/G-3213-2015; Fre, Silvia/C-7540-2017; Fouassier-Hucko, Laura/M-7556-2017","Fre, Silvia/0000-0002-7209-7636; Fouassier-Hucko, Laura/0000-0001-6377-5610; Whitehead, Joanne/0000-0002-9602-2081","CNRS; INSERM; ARC [5030, 29324]; ANR [09PIRI0013-01, 11 BSV5014-01]; Labex CelTisPhyBio [11-LBX-0038]; Fonds CSP; Fondation Pierre-Gille de Gennes; Fondation de France; Inca [PLBIO13-172]; Agence Nationale de la Recherche (investissements d'avenir) [ANR-10-EQPX-03, ANR10-INBS-09-08]; Canceropole Ile-de-France","This research was funded by the CNRS, INSERM, ARC (grant no.s 5030 and 29324), ANR (grant no.s 09PIRI0013-01 and 11 BSV5014-01), the Labex CelTisPhyBio (grant no. 11-LBX-0038), Fonds CSP, Fondation Pierre-Gille de Gennes, Fondation de France and the Inca (grant no.

Overexpressed MYC binds to virtually all active promoters within a cell, although with different binding affinities(2-4), and modulates the expression of distinct subsets of genes(1,2,4,5). However, the critical effectors of MYC in tumorigenesis remain largely unknown. Here we show that during lymphomagenesis in Em-myc transgenic mice, MYC directly upregulates the transcription of the core small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particle assembly genes, including Prmt5, an arginine methyltransferase that methylates Sm proteins(6,7). This coordinated regulatory effect is critical for the core biogenesis of small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particles, effective pre-messenger-RNA splicing, cell survival and proliferation. Our results demonstrate that MYC maintains the splicing fidelity of exons with a weak 5' donor site. Additionally, we identify pre-messenger-RNAs that are particularly sensitive to the perturbation of the MYC-PRMT5 axis, resulting in either intron retention (for example, Dvl1) or exon skipping (for example, Atr, Ep400). Using antisense oligonucleotides, we demonstrate the contribution of these splicing defects to the anti-proliferative/apoptotic phenotype observed in PRMT5-depleted E mu-myc B cells. We conclude that, in addition to its well-documented oncogenic functions in transcription(2-5) and translation(8), MYC also safeguards proper pre-messenger-RNA splicing as an essential step in lymphomagenesis.","[Koh, Cheryl M.; Bezzi, Marco; Low, Diana H.

Despite playing such decisive roles, it remains unclear whether or how these membrane-immersed enzymes might be regulated directly. To address this limitation, here we focus on intramembrane proteases containing domains known to exert regulatory functions in other contexts, and characterize a rhomboid protease that harbours calcium-binding EF-hands. We find calcium potently stimulates proteolysis by endogenous rhomboid-4 in Drosophila cells, and, remarkably, when rhomboid-4 is purified and reconstituted in liposomes. Interestingly, deleting the amino-terminal EF-hands activates proteolysis prematurely, while residues in cytoplasmic loops connecting distal transmembrane segments mediate calcium stimulation. Rhomboid regulation is not orchestrated by either dimerization or substrate interactions. Instead, calcium increases catalytic rate by promoting substrate gating. Substrates with cleavage sites outside the membrane can be cleaved but lose the capacity to be regulated. These observations indicate substrate gating is not an essential step in catalysis, but instead evolved as a mechanism for regulating proteolysis inside the membrane. Moreover, these insights provide new approaches for studying rhomboid functions by investigating upstream inputs that trigger proteolysis.","[Baker, Rosanna P.; Urban, Sinisa] Johns Hopkins Univ, Sch Med, Dept Mol Biol & Genet, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA","Urban, S (reprint author), Johns Hopkins Univ, Sch Med, Dept Mol Biol & Genet, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Room 507 PCTB,725 North Wolfe St, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA.",surban@jhmi.edu,,,National Institutes of Health [2R01AI066025]; Howard Hughes Medical Institute; David and Lucile Packard Foundation,"This work was supported by National Institutes of Health grant 2R01AI066025, the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, and the David and Lucile Packard Foundation.

ParR links the filaments with centromeric parC plasmid DNA, while facilitating the addition of subunits to ParM filaments(3,7-9). Growing ParMRC spindles push sister plasmids to the cell poles(9,10). Here, using modern electron cryomicroscopy methods, we investigate the structures and arrangements of ParM filaments in vitro and in cells, revealing at near-atomic resolution how subunits and filaments come together to produce the simplest known mitotic machinery. To understand the mechanism of dynamic instability, we determine structures of ParM filaments in different nucleotide states. The structure of filaments bound to the ATP analogue AMPPNP is determined at 4.3 angstrom resolution and refined. The ParM filament structure shows strong longitudinal interfaces and weaker lateral interactions. Also using electron cryomicroscopy, we reconstruct ParM doublets forming antiparallel spindles. Finally, with whole-cell electron cryotomography, we show that doublets are abundant in bacterial cells containing low-copy-number plasmids with the ParMRC locus, leading to an asynchronous model of R1 plasmid segregation.","[Bharat, Tanmay A.

Allosteric activation and inhibition of PFK1 by over ten metabolites and in response to hormonal signalling fine-tune glycolytic flux to meet energy requirements(1). Mutations inhibiting PFK1 activity cause glycogen storage disease type VII, also known as Tarui disease(2), and mice deficient in muscle PFK1 have decreased fat stores(3). Additionally, PFK1 is proposed to have important roles in metabolic reprogramming in cancer(4,5). Despite its critical role in glucose flux, the biologically relevant crystal structure of the mammalian PFK1 tetramer has not been determined. Here we report the first structures of the mammalian PFK1 tetramer, for the human platelet isoform (PFKP), in complex with ATP-Mg2+ and ADP at 3.1 and 3.4 angstrom, respectively. The structures reveal substantial conformational changes in the enzyme upon nucleotide hydrolysis as well as a unique tetramer interface. Mutations of residues in this interface can affect tetramer formation, enzyme catalysis and regulation, indicating the functional importance of the tetramer. With altered glycolytic flux being a hallmark of cancers(6), these new structures allow a molecular understanding of the functional consequences of somatic PFK1 mutations identified in human cancers. We characterize three of these mutations and show they have distinct effects on allosteric regulation of PFKP activity and lactate production. The PFKP structural blueprint for somatic mutations as well as the catalytic site can guide therapeutic targeting of PFK1 activity to control dysregulated glycolysis in disease.","[Webb, Bradley A.; Barber, Diane L.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Cell & Tissue Biol, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; [Forouhar, Farhad; Szu, Fu-En; Seetharaman, Jayaraman; Tong, Liang] Columbia Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Northeast Struct Genom Consortium, New York, NY 10027 USA","Barber, DL (reprint author), Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Cell & Tissue Biol, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA.",ltong@columbia.edu; diane.barber@ucsf.edu,,"Webb, Bradley/0000-0002-5299-2852; Tong, Liang/0000-0002-0563-6468","National Institutes of Health [R01 GM047413]; Canadian Institutes of Health Research; University of California, San Francisco, Liver Center [P30 DK026743]; Protein Structure Initiative of the National Institutes of Health [U54-GM094597]","We thank S.

Here we report in Arabidopsis that Stomagen (also called EPF-LIKE9) peptide, which promotes stomatal development, requires ERECTA (ER)-family receptor kinases and interferes with the inhibition of stomatal development by the EPIDERMAL PATTERNING FACTOR 2 (EPF2)-ER module. Both EPF2 and Stomagen directly bind to ER and its co-receptor TOO MANY MOUTHS. Stomagen peptide competitively replaced EPF2 binding to ER.

This evolution implies a change in the average properties of the interstellar medium, but the measurements are systematically uncertain owing to untested assumptions(4,5) and the inability to detect heavily obscured regions of the galaxies. Previous attempts to measure the interstellar medium directly in normal galaxies at these red-shifts have failed for a number of reasons(6-9), with two notable exceptions(10,11). Here we report measurements of the forbidden C II emission (that is, [C II]) from gas, and the far-infrared emission from dust, in nine typical star-forming galaxies about one billion years after the Big Bang (z approximate to 5-6). We find that these galaxies have thermal emission that is less than 1/12 that of similar systems about two billion years later, and enhanced [C II] emission relative to the far-infrared continuum, confirming a strong evolution in the properties of the interstellar medium in the early Universe. The gas is distributed over scales of one to eight kiloparsecs, and shows diverse dynamics within the sample. These results are consistent with early galaxies having significantly less dust than typical galaxies seen at z < 3 and being comparable in dust content to local low-metallicity systems(12).","[Capak, P.

Atmospheric mass loss primarily affects low-mass exoplanets, leading to the suggestion that hot rocky planets(7-9) might have begun as Neptune-like(10-16), but subsequently lost all of their atmospheres; however, no confident measurements have hitherto been available. The signature of this loss could be observed in the ultraviolet spectrum, when the planet and its escaping atmosphere transit the star, giving rise to deeper and longer transit signatures than in the optical spectrum(17). Here we report that in the ultraviolet the Neptune-mass exoplanet GJ 436b (also known as Gliese 436b) has transit depths of 56.3 +/- 63.5% (1 sigma), far beyond the 0.69% optical transit depth. The ultraviolet transits repeatedly start about two hours before, and end more than three hours after the approximately one hour optical transit, which is substantially different from one previous claim(6) (based on an inaccurate ephemeris). We infer from this that the planet is surrounded and trailed by a large exospheric cloud composed mainly of hydrogen atoms. We estimate a mass-loss rate in the range of about 10(8)-10(9) grams per second, which is far too small to deplete the atmosphere of a Neptune-like planet in the lifetime of the parent star, but would have been much greater in the past.","[Ehrenreich, David; Bourrier, Vincent; Udry, Stephane] Observ Univ Geneve, CH-1290 Versoix, Switzerland; [Wheatley, Peter J.] Univ Warwick, Dept Phys, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England; [Etangs, Alain Lecavelier des; Hebrard, Guillaume; Vidal-Madjar, Alfred] CNRS, UMR 7095, Inst Astrophys Paris, F-75014 Paris, France; [Etangs, Alain Lecavelier des; Hebrard, Guillaume; Vidal-Madjar, Alfred] Univ Paris 06, Sorbonne Univ, UMR 7095, Inst Astrophys Paris, F-75014 Paris, France; [Hebrard, Guillaume] CNRS, Observ Haute Provence, F-04870 St Michel lObservatoire, France; [Hebrard, Guillaume] OAMP, F-04870 St Michel lObservatoire, France; [Bonfils, Xavier; Delfosse, Xavier] Univ Grenoble Alpes, IPAG, F-38000 Grenoble, France; [Bonfils, Xavier; Delfosse, Xavier] CNRS, IPAG, F-38000 Grenoble, France; [Desert, Jean-Michel] Univ Colorado, Dept Astrophys & Planetary Sci, CASA, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Sing, David K.] Univ Exeter, Astrophys Grp, Sch Phys, Exeter EX4 4QL, Devon, England","Ehrenreich, D (reprint author), Observ Univ Geneve, 51 Chemin Maillettes, CH-1290 Versoix, Switzerland.",david.ehrenreich@unige.ch,,"Ehrenreich, David/0000-0001-9704-5405; Sing, David /0000-0001-6050-7645; Bonfils, Xavier/0000-0001-9003-8894; Wheatley, Peter/0000-0003-1452-2240",NASA [NAS 5-26555]; Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF); CNES; French Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR) [ANR-12-BS05-0012]; Fondation Simone et Cino Del Duca; European Research Council (ERC) under ERC [337591-ExTrA];  [11817];  [12034];  [12965],"This work is based on observations made with the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope, obtained at the Space Telescope Science Institute, which is operated by the Association of Universities for Researchin Astronomy, Inc., under NASA contract NAS 5-26555.

This sub-cycle effect generates coherent soft X-rays(3) and attosecond pulses(4), and provides a means to image molecular orbitals(5). Recently, high harmonics have been generated from bulk crystals(6,7), but what mechanism(8-12) dominates the emission remains uncertain. To resolve this issue, we adapt measurement methods from gas-phase research(13,14) to solid zinc oxide driven by mid-infrared laser fields of 0.25 volts per angstrom. We find that when we alter the generation process with a second-harmonic beam, the modified harmonic spectrum bears the signature of a generalized recollision between an electron and its associated hole(11). In addition, we find that solid-state high harmonics are perturbed by fields so weak that they are present in conventional electronic circuits, thus opening a route to integrate electronics with attosecond and high-harmonic technology. Future experiments will permit the band structure of a solid(15) to be tomographically reconstructed.","[Vampa, G.; Hammond, T. J.; McDonald, C. R.; Brabec, T.; Corkum, P.

Recent increases in the occurrence of some extreme weather phenomena(1,2) have led to multiple mechanistic hypotheses linking changes in atmospheric circulation to increasing probability of extreme events(3-5). However, observed evidence of long-term change in atmospheric circulation remains inconclusive(6-8). Here we identify statistically significant trends in the occurrence of atmospheric circulation patterns, which partially explain observed trends in surface temperature extremes over seven mid-latitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere. Using self-organizing map cluster analysis(9-12), we detect robust circulation pattern trends in a subset of these regions during both the satellite observation era (1979-2013) and the recent period of rapid Arctic sea-ice decline (1990-2013). Particularly substantial influences include the contribution of increasing trends in anticyclonic circulations to summer and autumn hot extremes over portions of Eurasia and North America, and the contribution of increasing trends in northerly flow to winter cold extremes over central Asia. Our results indicate that although a substantial portion of the observed change in extreme temperature occurrence has resulted from regional-and global-scale thermodynamic changes, the risk of extreme temperatures over some regions has also been altered by recent changes in the frequency, persistence and maximum duration of regional circulation patterns.","[Horton, Daniel E.; Singh, Deepti; Swain, Daniel L.; Rajaratnam, Bala; Diffenbaugh, Noah S.] Stanford Univ, Dept Earth Syst Sci, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Horton, Daniel E.; Rajaratnam, Bala; Diffenbaugh, Noah S.] Stanford Univ, Woods Inst Environm, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Johnson, Nathaniel C.] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Int Pacific Res Ctr, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; [Johnson, Nathaniel C.] Univ Calif San Diego, Scripps Inst Oceanog, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Johnson, Nathaniel C.] Princeton Univ, Cooperat Inst Climate Sci, Princeton, NJ 08540 USA; [Rajaratnam, Bala] Stanford Univ, Dept Stat, Stanford, CA 94305 USA","Horton, DE (reprint author), Stanford Univ, Dept Earth Syst Sci, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",danethan@stanford.edu,"Johnson, Nathaniel/L-8045-2015","Johnson, Nathaniel/0000-0003-4906-178X; Horton, Daniel/0000-0002-2065-4517; Swain, Daniel/0000-0003-4276-3092","NSF CAREER Award [0955283]; DOE Integrated Assessment Research Program [DE-SC005171DE-SC005171]; G.J.

It has been theorized that these costs could be countered if sex allows sexual selection to clear the universal fitness constraint of mutation load(2-4). Under sexual selection, competition between (usually) males and mate choice by (usually) females create important intraspecific filters for reproductive success, so that only a subset of males gains paternity. If reproductive success under sexual selection is dependent on individual condition, which is contingent to mutation load, then sexually selected filtering through 'genic capture'(5) could offset the costs of sex because it provides genetic benefits to populations. Here we test this theory experimentally by comparing whether populations with histories of strong versus weak sexual selection purge mutation load and resist extinction differently. After evolving replicate populations of the flour beetle Tribolium castaneum for 6 to 7 years under conditions that differed solely in the strengths of sexual selection, we revealed mutation load using inbreeding. Lineages from populations that had previously experienced strong sexual selection were resilient to extinction and maintained fitness under inbreeding, with some families continuing to survive after 20 generations of sib 3 sib mating. By contrast, lineages derived from populations that experienced weak or nonexistent sexual selection showed rapid fitness declines under inbreeding, and all were extinct after generation 10. Multiple mutations across the genome with individually small effects can be difficult to clear, yet sum to a significant fitness load; our findings reveal that sexual selection reduces this load, improving population viability in the face of genetic stress.","[Lumley, Alyson J.; Kitson, James J.

Treatment of these anaemias requires a drug that acts at an earlier stage of red cell formation and enhances the formation of Epo-sensitive CFU-E progenitors. Recently, we showed that glucocorticoids specifically stimulate self-renewal of an early erythroid progenitor, burst-forming unit erythroid (BFU-E), and increase the production of terminally differentiated erythroid cells(10,11). Here we show that activation of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPAR-alpha) by the PPAR-alpha agonists GW7647 and fenofibrate synergizes with the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) to promote BFU-E self-renewal. Over time these agonists greatly increase production of mature red blood cells in cultures of both mouse fetal liver BFU-Es and mobilized human adult CD34(+) peripheral blood progenitors, with a new and effective culture system being used for the human cells that generates normal enucleated reticulocytes. Although Ppara(-/-) mice show no haematological difference from wild-typemice in both normal and phenylhydrazine (PHZ)-induced stress erythropoiesis, PPAR-alpha agonists facilitate recovery of wild-type but not Ppara(-/-) mice from PHZ-induced acute haemolytic anaemia. We also show that PPAR-alpha alleviates anaemia in a mouse model of chronic anaemia. Finally, both in control and corticosteroid- treated BFU-E cells, PPAR-alpha co-occupies many chromatin sites with GR; when activated by PPAR-alpha agonists, additional PPAR-alpha is recruited to GR-adjacent sites and presumably facilitates GR-dependent BFU-E self-renewal. Our discovery of the role of PPAR-alpha agonists in stimulating self-renewal of early erythroid progenitor cells suggests that the clinically tested PPAR-alpha agonists we used may improve the efficacy of corticosteroids in treating Epo-resistant anaemias.","[Lee, Hsiang-Ying; Gao, Xiaofei; Barrasa, M.

A novel PrP variant, G127V, was under positive evolutionary selection during the epidemic of kuru-an acquired prion disease epidemic of the Fore population in Papua New Guinea-and appeared to provide strong protection against disease in the heterozygous state(2). Here we have investigated the protective role of this variant and its interaction with the common, worldwide M129V PrP polymorphism. V127 was seen exclusively on a M129 PRNP allele. We demonstrate that transgenic mice expressing both variant and wild-type human PrP are completely resistant to both kuru and classical Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) prions (which are closely similar) but can be infected with variant CJD prions, a human prion strain resulting from exposure to bovine spongiform encephalopathy prions to which the Fore were not exposed. Notably, mice expressing only PrP V127 were completely resistant to all prion strains, demonstrating a different molecular mechanism to M129V, which provides its relative protection against classical CJD and kuru in the heterozygous state. Indeed, this single amino acid substitution (G -> V) at a residue invariant in vertebrate evolution is as protective as deletion of the protein. Further study in transgenic mice expressing different ratios of variant and wild-type PrP indicates that not only is PrP V127 completely refractory to prion conversion but acts as a potent dose-dependent inhibitor of wild-type prion propagation.","[Asante, Emmanuel A.; Smidak, Michelle; Grimshaw, Andrew; Houghton, Richard; Tomlinson, Andrew; Jeelani, Asif; Jakubcova, Tatiana; Hamdan, Shyma; Richard-Londt, Angela; Linehan, Jacqueline M.; Brandner, Sebastian; Alpers, Michael; Whitfield, Jerome; Mead, Simon; Wadsworth, Jonathan D.

JNK signalling is known to play an important part in driving the malignant progression of many epithelial tumours, although the link between loss of polarity and JNK signalling remains elusive. In a Drosophila genome-wide genetic screen designed to identify molecules implicated in neoplastic growth(1), we identified grindelwald (grnd), a gene encoding a transmembrane protein with homology to members of the tumour necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) superfamily. Here we show that Grnd mediates the pro-apoptotic functions of Eiger (Egr), the unique Drosophila TNF, and that overexpression of an active form of Grnd lacking the extracellular domain is sufficient to activate JNK signalling in vivo. Grnd also promotes the invasiveness of Ras(V12)/scrib(-/-) tumours through Egr-dependent Matrix metallo-protease-1 (Mmp1) expression. Grnd localizes to the subapical membrane domain with the cell polarity determinant Crumbs (Crb) and couples Crb-induced loss of polarity with JNK activation and neoplastic growth through physical interaction with Veli (also known as Lin-7). Therefore, Grnd represents the first example of a TNFR that integrates signals from both Egr and apical polarity determinants to induce JNK-dependent cell death or tumour growth.","[Andersen, Ditte S.; Colombani, Julien; Chakrabandhu, Krittalak; Boone, Emilie; Hueber, Anne-Odile; Leopold, Pierre] Univ Nice Sophia Antipolis, Inst Biol Valrose, F-06108 Nice, France; [Andersen, Ditte S.; Colombani, Julien; Chakrabandhu, Krittalak; Boone, Emilie; Hueber, Anne-Odile; Leopold, Pierre] CNRS, Inst Biol Valrose, F-06108 Nice, France; [Andersen, Ditte S.; Colombani, Julien; Chakrabandhu, Krittalak; Boone, Emilie; Hueber, Anne-Odile; Leopold, Pierre] INSERM, Inst Biol Valrose, F-06108 Nice, France; [Andersen, Ditte S.; Colombani, Julien; Boone, Emilie; Leopold, Pierre] Inst Biol Valrose, Genet & Physiol Growth Lab, F-06108 Nice, France; [Palmerini, Valentina; Mapelli, Marina] European Inst Oncol, Dept Expt Oncol, I-20139 Milan, Italy; [Chakrabandhu, Krittalak; Hueber, Anne-Odile] Inst Biol Valrose, Death Receptors Signalling & Canc Therapy Lab, F-06108 Nice, France; [Roethlisberger, Michael; Toggweiler, Janine; Basler, Konrad] Univ Zurich, Inst Mol Life Sci, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland","Colombani, J (reprint author), Univ Nice Sophia Antipolis, Inst Biol Valrose, Parc Valrose, F-06108 Nice, France.",julien.colombani@unice.fr; leopold@unice.fr,"HUEBER, Anne-Odile/G-4352-2013","Andersen, Ditte/0000-0003-1209-6102",CNRS; INSERM; Agence Nationale de la Recherche; Fondation pour la Recherche Medicale; Association pour la Recherche contre le Cancer [PJA20131200042]; European Research Council [268813]; Marie Curie Life Long Training grant [252373]; Labex Signalife program [ANR-11-LABX-0028-01]; Italian Association for Cancer Research (AIRC) [IG-12877]; Italian Ministry of Health [GR-2008-1134103],"We thank G.

However, recently developed single-cell-based antibody cloning methods have uncovered a new generation of far more potent broadly neutralizing antibodies to HIV-1 (refs 4, 5). These antibodies can prevent infection and suppress viraemia in humanized mice and nonhuman primates, but their potential for human HIV-1 immunotherapy has not been evaluated(6-10). Here we report the results of a first-in-man dose escalation phase 1 clinical trial of 3BNC117, a potent human CD4 binding site antibody(11), in uninfected and HIV-1-infected individuals. 3BNC117 infusion was well tolerated and demonstrated favourable pharmacokinetics. A single 30mg kg(-1) infusion of 3BNC117 reduced the viral load in HIV-1-infected individuals by 0.8-2.5 log(10) and viraemia remained significantly reduced for 28 days. Emergence of resistant viral strains was variable, with some individuals remaining sensitive to 3BNC117 for a period of 28 days. We conclude that, as a single agent, 3BNC117 is safe and effective in reducing HIV-1 viraemia, and that immunotherapy should be explored as a new modality for HIV-1 prevention, therapy and cure.","[Caskey, Marina; Klein, Florian; Lorenzi, Julio C.

Senescence is triggered by short telomeres and is bypassed by disruption of tumour-suppressive pathways. After senescence bypass, cells undergo crisis, during which almost all of the cells in the population die. Cells that escape crisis harbour unstable genomes and other parameters of transformation. The mechanism of cell death during crisis remains unexplained. Here we show that human cells in crisis undergo spontaneous mitotic arrest, resulting in death during mitosis or in the following cell cycle. This phenotype is induced by loss of p53 function, and is suppressed by telomerase overexpression. Telomere fusions triggered mitotic arrest in p53-compromised non-crisis cells, indicating that such fusions are the underlying cause of cell death. Exacerbation of mitotic telomere deprotection by partial TRF2 (also known as TERF2) knockdown(2) increased the ratio of cells that died duringmitotic arrest and sensitized cancer cells to mitotic poisons. We propose a crisis pathway wherein chromosome fusions induce mitotic arrest, resulting in mitotic telomere deprotection and cell death, thereby eliminating precancerous cells from the population.","[Hayashi, Makoto T.; Cesare, Anthony J.; Rivera, Teresa; Karlseder, Jan] Salk Inst Biol Studies, Mol & Cell Biol Dept, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; [Hayashi, Makoto T.] Kyoto Univ, Dept Gene Mech, Grad Sch Biostudies, Hakubi Ctr Adv Res,Sakyo Ku, Kyoto 6068501, Japan; [Cesare, Anthony J.] Univ Sydney, Childrens Med Res Inst, Westmead, NSW 2145, Australia","Karlseder, J (reprint author), Salk Inst Biol Studies, Mol & Cell Biol Dept, 10010 N Torrey Pines Rd, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA.",karlseder@salk.edu,"Cesare, Anthony/F-4691-2010","Cesare, Anthony/0000-0002-0864-1254; Hayashi, Makoto/0000-0001-6360-7131","Human Frontier Science Program; Japan Society for the Promotion of Science; NIH NRSA [5T32CA009370]; Glenn Center for Research on Aging; CIRM [TG2-01158]; Salk Institute Cancer Center Core Grant [P30CA014195]; NIH [R01GM087476, R01CA174942]; Donald and Darlene Shiley Chair; Highland Street Foundation; Fritz B.

Despite biochemical studies on individual gene products, the composition and cofactor requirement of the enzyme responsible for in vivo decarboxylase activity remained unclear(7-9). Here we show that Fdc1 is solely responsible for the reversible decarboxylase activity, and that it requires a new type of cofactor: a prenylated flavin synthesized by the associated UbiX/Pad1(10). Atomic resolution crystal structures reveal that two distinct isomers of the oxidized cofactor can be observed, an isoalloxazine N5-iminium adduct and a N5 secondary ketimine species with markedly altered ring structure, both having azomethine ylide character. Substrate binding positions the dipolarophile enoic acid group directly above the azomethine ylide group. The structure of a covalent inhibitor-cofactor adduct suggests that 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition chemistry supports reversible decarboxylation in these enzymes. Although 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition is commonly used in organic chemistry(11,12), we propose that this presents the first example, to our knowledge, of an enzymatic 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition reaction. Our model for Fdc1/UbiD catalysis offers new routes in alkene hydrocarbon production or aryl (de) carboxylation.","[Payne, Karl A.

Eleven genes have been implicated in bacterial ubiquinone biosynthesis, including ubiX and ubiD, which are responsible for decarboxylation of the 3-octaprenyl-4-hydroxy-benzoate precursor(2). Despite structural and biochemical characterization of UbiX as a flavin mononucleotide (FMN)-binding protein, no decarboxylase activity has been detected(3,4). Here we report that UbiX produces a novel flavin-derived cofactor required for the decarboxylase activity of UbiD(5). UbiX acts as a flavin prenyltransferase, linking a dimethylallyl moiety to the flavin N5 and C6 atoms. This adds a fourth non-aromatic ring to the flavin isoalloxazine group. In contrast to other prenyltransferases(6,7), UbiX is metal-independent and requires dimethylallyl-monophosphate as substrate. Kinetic crystallography reveals that the prenyltransferase mechanism of UbiX resembles that of the terpene synthases(8). The active site environment is dominated by pi systems, which assist phosphate-C1' bond breakage following FMN reduction, leading to formation of the N5-C1' bond. UbiX then acts as a chaperone for adduct reorientation, via transient carbocation species, leading ultimately to formation of the dimethylallyl C3'-C6 bond. Our findings establish the mechanism for formation of a new flavin-derived cofactor, extending both flavin and terpenoid biochemical repertoires.","[White, Mark D.; Payne, Karl A.

Although the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus are known to contribute jointly to successful spatial working memory, the anatomical pathway and temporal window for the interaction of these structures critical to spatial working memory has not yet been established. Here we find that direct hippocampal-prefrontal afferents are critical for encoding, but not for maintenance or retrieval, of spatial cues in mice. These cues are represented by the activity of individual prefrontal units in a manner that is dependent on hippocampal input only during the cue-encoding phase of a spatial working memory task. Successful encoding of these cues appears to be mediated by gamma-frequency synchrony between the two structures. These findings indicate a critical role for the direct hippocampal-prefrontal afferent pathway in the continuous updating of task-related spatial information during spatial working memory.","[Spellman, Timothy; Gogos, Joseph A.] Columbia Univ, Dept Physiol & Cellular Biophys, New York, NY 10032 USA; [Rigotti, Mattia; Fusi, Stefano; Gogos, Joseph A.] Columbia Univ, Dept Neurosci, New York, NY 10032 USA; [Rigotti, Mattia] IBM Corp, TJ Watson Res Ctr, Yorktown Hts, NY 10598 USA; [Rigotti, Mattia] Columbia Univ, Italian Acad Adv Studies Amer, New York, NY 10032 USA; [Ahmari, Susanne E.] Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Psychiat, Translat Neurosci Program, Pittsburgh, PA 15219 USA; [Ahmari, Susanne E.] Univ Pittsburgh, Ctr Neurosci, Pittsburgh, PA 15261 USA; [Ahmari, Susanne E.] Univ Pittsburgh, Ctr Neural Basis Cognit, Pittsburgh, PA 15261 USA; [Fusi, Stefano] Columbia Univ, Kavli Inst Brain Sci, New York, NY 10032 USA; [Gordon, Joshua A.] Columbia Univ, Dept Psychiat, New York, NY 10032 USA; [Gordon, Joshua A.] New York State Psychiat Inst & Hosp, Div Integrat Neurosci, New York, NY 10032 USA","Gordon, JA (reprint author), Columbia Univ, Dept Psychiat, 1051 Riverside Dr, New York, NY 10032 USA.",jg343@columbia.edu,"Ahmari, Susanne/J-5812-2013","Ahmari, Susanne/0000-0003-4576-076X; Rigotti, Mattia/0000-0001-6466-2810","National Institutes of Health [MH096274, MH081968]; Hope for Depression Research Foundation; International Mental Health Research Organization; Gatsby Charitable Foundation; Swartz Foundation","The authors would like to thank M.

DDD107498 was developed from a screening programme against blood-stage malaria parasites; its molecular target has been identified as translation elongation factor 2 (eEF2), which is responsible for the GTP-dependent translocation of the ribosome along messenger RNA, and is essential for protein synthesis.

In some systems with multiple transiting planets, the times of the transits are measurably affected by the gravitational interactions between neighbouring planets(1,2). In favourable cases, the departures from Keplerian orbits (that is, unaffected by gravitational effects) implied by the observed transit times permit the planetary masses to be measured, which is key to determining their bulk densities(3). Characterizing rocky planets is particularly difficult, because they are generally smaller and less massive than gaseous planets. Therefore, few exoplanets near the size of Earth have had their masses measured. Here we report the sizes and masses of three planets orbiting Kepler-138, a star much fainter and cooler than the Sun. We determine that the mass of the Mars-sized inner planet, Kepler-138 b, is 0.066(-0.037)(+0.059) Earth masses. Its density is 2.6(-1.5)(+2.4) grams per cubic centimetre. The middle and outer planets are both slightly larger than Earth. The middle planet's density (6.2(-3.4)(+5.8) grams per cubic centimetre) is similar to that of Earth, and the outer planet is less than half as dense at 2.1(-1.2)(+2.2) grams per cubic centimetre, implying that it contains a greater portion of low-density components such as water and hydrogen.","[Jontof-Hutter, Daniel; Ford, Eric B.] Penn State Univ, Dept Astron, Davey Lab, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Jontof-Hutter, Daniel; Rowe, Jason F.; Lissauer, Jack J.] NASA, Ames Res Ctr, Moffett Field, CA 94035 USA; [Rowe, Jason F.] SETI Inst, Mountain View, CA 94043 USA; [Fabrycky, Daniel C.] Univ Chicago, Dept Astron & Astrophys, Chicago, IL 60637 USA","Jontof-Hutter, D (reprint author), Penn State Univ, Dept Astron, Davey Lab, University Pk, PA 16802 USA.",dxj14@psu.edu,,"Fabrycky, Daniel/0000-0003-3750-0183; /0000-0001-6545-639X",NASA Postdoctoral Program; Center for Exoplanets and Habitable Worlds; Pennsylvania State University; Eberly College of Science; Pennsylvania Space Grant Consortium; NASA [NNX14AB92G]; Kepler Participating Scientist Program award [NNX14AB87G]; NASA Kepler Participating Scientist Program award [NNX14AN76G]; NASA Exoplanet Research Program award [NNX15AE21G],"D.J-H. acknowledges support through the NASA Postdoctoral Program and funding from the Center for Exoplanets and Habitable Worlds.

Gravitationally bound ejecta clouds that form dust exospheres were recognized by in situ dust instruments around the icy moons of Jupiter(4) and Saturn(5), but have hitherto not been observed near bodies with refractory regolith surfaces. High-altitude Apollo 15 and 17 observations of a 'horizon glow' indicated a putative population of high-density small dust particles near the lunar terminators(6,7), although later orbital observations(8,9) yielded upper limits on the abundance of such particles that were a factor of about 10(4) lower than that necessary to produce the Apollo results. Here we report observations of a permanent, asymmetric dust cloud around the Moon, caused by impacts of high-speed cometary dust particles on eccentric orbits, as opposed to particles of asteroidal origin following near-circular paths striking the Moon at lower speeds. The density of the lunar ejecta cloud increases during the annual meteor showers, especially the Geminids, because the lunar surface is exposed to the same stream of interplanetary dust particles. We expect all airless planetary objects to be immersed in similar tenuous clouds of dust.","[Horanyi, M.; Szalay, J.

Transition-metal carbonyl complexes are vital to industry, appear naturally in the active sites of a number of enzymes (such as hydrogenases), are promising therapeutic agents(1), and have even been observed in interstellar dust clouds(2). Despite the wealth of established transition-metal multicarbonyl complexes(3), no elements outside groups 4 to 12 of the periodic table have yet been shown to react directly with two or more CO units to form stable multicarbonyl adducts. Here we present the synthesis of a borylene dicarbonyl complex, the first multicarbonyl complex of a main-group element prepared using CO. The compound is additionally stable towards ambient air and moisture. The synthetic strategy used-liberation of a borylene ligand from a transition metal using donor ligands-is broadly applicable, leading to a number of unprecedented monovalent boron species with different Lewis basic groups. The similarity of these compounds to conventional transition-metal carbonyl complexes is demonstrated by photolytic liberation of CO and subsequent intramolecular carbon-carbon bond activation.","[Braunschweig, Holger; Dewhurst, Rian D.; Hupp, Florian; Nutz, Marco; Radacki, Krzysztof; Tate, Christopher W.; Ye, Qing] Univ Wurzburg, Inst Anorgan Chem, D-97074 Wurzburg, Germany; [Vargas, Alfredo] Univ Sussex, Sch Life Sci, Dept Chem, Brighton BN1 9QJ, E Sussex, England","Braunschweig, H (reprint author), Univ Wurzburg, Inst Anorgan Chem, D-97074 Wurzburg, Germany.",h.braunschweig@uni-wuerzburg.de,"Ye, Qing/J-2736-2014; Vargas, Alfredo/N-6711-2015","Vargas, Alfredo/0000-0001-7491-791X; Braunschweig, Holger/0000-0001-9264-1726; Dewhurst, Rian/0000-0001-5978-811X",European Research Council,This work was supported by a European Research Council Advanced Grant to H.B.,,30,70,70,9,76,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,18-Jun,2015,522,7556,,,,,327,330,,10.1038/nature14489,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,CK7PU,WOS:000356425400050,26085273,No,Y,N,11/19/17

A new, bizarre herbivorous basal tetanuran from the Upper Jurassic of Chile challenges this conception. The new dinosaur was discovered at Aysen, a fossil locality in the Upper Jurassic Toqui Formation of southern Chile (General Carrera Lake)(3,4). The site yielded abundant and exquisitely preserved three-dimensional skeletons of small archosaurs.

Animal models can exhibit limited but quantifiable behavioural impairments resulting from chronic stress, including deficits in motivation, abnormal responses to behavioural challenges, and anhedonia(3-5). The hippocampus is thought to negatively regulate the stress response and to mediate various cognitive and mnemonic aspects of stress-induced impairments(2,3,5), although the neuronal underpinnings sufficient to support behavioural improvements are largely unknown. Here we acutely rescue stress-induced depression-related behaviours in mice by optogenetically reactivating dentate gyrus cells that were previously active during a positive experience. A brain-wide histological investigation, coupled with pharmacological and projection-specific optogenetic blockade experiments, identified glutamatergic activity in the hippocampus-amygdala-nucleus-accumbens pathway as a candidate circuit supporting the acute rescue. Finally, chronically reactivating hippocampal cells associated with a positive memory resulted in the rescue of stress-induced behavioural impairments and neurogenesis at time points beyond the light stimulation. Together, our data suggest that activating positive memories artificially is sufficient to suppress depression-like behaviours and point to dentate gyrus engram cells as potential therapeutic nodes for intervening with maladaptive behavioural states.","[Ramirez, Steve; MacDonald, Christopher J.; Moffa, Anthony; Zhou, Joanne; Redondo, Roger L.; Tonegawa, Susumu] MIT, Dept Biol, Picower Inst Learning & Memory, RIKEN MIT Ctr Neural Circuit Genet, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Ramirez, Steve; MacDonald, Christopher J.; Moffa, Anthony; Zhou, Joanne; Redondo, Roger L.; Tonegawa, Susumu] MIT, Dept Brain & Cognit Sci, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Redondo, Roger L.] MIT, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA","Tonegawa, S (reprint author), MIT, Dept Biol, Picower Inst Learning & Memory, RIKEN MIT Ctr Neural Circuit Genet, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",tonegawa@mit.edu,,,RIKEN Brain Science Institute; Howard Hughes Medical Institute,"We thank B.

The molecular hallmark of synucleinopathies such as Parkinson's disease, dementia with Lewy bodies and multiple system atrophy are megadalton alpha-synuclein-rich deposits suggestive of one molecular event causing distinct disease phenotypes. Glial alpha-synuclein (alpha-SYN) filamentous deposits are prominent in multiple system atrophy and neuronal alpha-SYN inclusions are found in Parkinson's disease and dementia with Lewy bodies(2). The discovery of alpha-SYN assemblies with different structural characteristics or 'strains' has led to the hypothesis that strains could account for the different clinicopathological traits within synucleinopathies(3,4). In this study we show that alpha-SYN strain conformation and seeding propensity lead to distinct histopathological and behavioural phenotypes. We assess the properties of structurally well-defined alpha-SYN assemblies (oligomers, ribbons and fibrils) after injection in rat brain. We prove that alpha-SYN strains amplify in vivo. Fibrils seem to be the major toxic strain, resulting in progressive motor impairment and cell death, whereas ribbons cause a distinct histopathological phenotype displaying Parkinson's disease and multiple system atrophy traits. Additionally, we show that alpha-SYN assemblies cross the blood-brain barrier and distribute to the central nervous system after intravenous injection. Our results demonstrate that distinct alpha-SYN strains display differential seeding capacities, inducing strain-specific pathology and neurotoxic phenotypes.","[Peelaerts, W.; Van der Perren, A.; Van den Haute, C.; Baekelandt, V.] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Lab Neurobiol & Gene Therapy, Dept Neurosci, B-3000 Leuven, Belgium; [Bousset, L.; Melki, R.] CNRS, Paris Saclay Inst Neurosci, F-91198 Gif Sur Yvette, France; [Moskalyuk, A.; Pulizzi, R.; Giugliano, M.] Univ Antwerp, Dept Biomed Sci, Theoret Neurobiol & Neuroengn Lab, B-2610 Antwerp, Belgium; [Giugliano, M.] Univ Sheffield, Dept Comp Sci, Sheffield S1 4DP, S Yorkshire, England; [Giugliano, M.] Swiss Fed Inst Technol Lausanne, Brain Mind Inst, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland; [Giugliano, M.] Neuroelect Res Flanders NERF, B-3001 Leuven, Belgium; [Van den Haute, C.] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Viral Vector Core, B-3000 Leuven, Belgium","Baekelandt, V (reprint author), Katholieke Univ Leuven, Lab Neurobiol & Gene Therapy, Dept Neurosci, B-3000 Leuven, Belgium.",ronald.melki@lebs.cnrs-gif.fr; veerle.baekelandt@med.kuleuven.be,,"Giugliano, Michele/0000-0003-2626-594X","FWO-Vlaanderen [G.0768.10, G.0927.14]; IWT-Vlaanderen [IWT SBO/80020 Neuro-TARGET, SBO/110068 OPTOBRAIN, SBO/130065 MIRIAD]; FP7 RTD project MEFOPA [HEALTH-2009-241791]; FP7 RTD project INMiND [HEALTH-F2-2011-278850]; KU Leuven [OT/08/052A, OT/14/120, IMIR PF/10/017]; Agence Nationale de la Recherche [ANR-09-MNPS-013-01, ANR-11-BSV8-021-01]; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique; 'Coup d'Elan a la Recherche Francaise' award from Fondation Bettencourt Schueller; EC-FP7 (Marie Curie Initial Training Network ""NAMASEN"") [264872]; ICT-FET project ""ENLIGHTENMENT""; ICT-FET project ""BRAINLEAP"" [284801, 306502]; Belgian Science Policy Office [IUAP-VII/20]","We thank J.

The different steps of the metastatic cascade rely on reciprocal interactions between cancer cells and their microenvironment. Within this local microenvironment and in distant organs, immune cells and their mediators are known to facilitate metastasis formation(1,2). However, theprecisecontributionof tumour-induced systemic inflammation to metastasis and the mechanisms regulating systemic inflammation are poorly understood. Here we show that tumours maximize their chance of metastasizing by evoking a systemic inflammatory cascade in mouse models of spontaneous breast cancer metastasis. We mechanistically demonstrate that interleukin (IL)-1 beta elicits IL-17 expression from gamma delta (gamma delta) T cells, resulting in systemic, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF)-dependent expansion and polarization of neutrophils in mice bearing mammary tumours. Tumour-induced neutrophils acquire the ability to suppress cytotoxic T lymphocytes carrying the CD8 antigen, which limit the establishment of metastases. Neutralization of IL-17 or G-CSF and absence of gamma delta T cells prevents neutrophil accumulation and downregulates the T-cell-suppressive phenotype of neutrophils. Moreover, the absence of gamma delta T cells or neutrophils profoundly reduces pulmonary and lymph node metastases without influencing primary tumour progression. Our data indicate that targeting this novel cancer-cell-initiated domino effect within the immune system-the gamma delta T cell/IL-17/neutrophil axis-represents a new strategy to inhibit metastatic disease.","[Coffelt, Seth B.; Kersten, Kelly; Doornebal, Chris W.; Weiden, Jorieke; Vrijland, Kim; Hau, Cheei-Sing; Verstegen, Niels J.

However, MET is expressed not only by cancer cells but also by tumour-associated stromal cells, although its precise role in this compartment is not well characterized(6-11). Here we show that MET is required for neutrophil chemoattraction and cytotoxicity in response to its ligand hepatocyte growth factor (HGF). Met deletion in mouse neutrophils enhances tumour growth and metastasis. This phenotype correlates with reduced neutrophil infiltration to both the primary tumour and metastatic sites. Similarly, Met is necessary for neutrophil transudation during colitis, skin rash or peritonitis. Mechanistically, Met is induced by tumour-derived tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha or other inflammatory stimuli in both mouse and human neutrophils. This induction is instrumental for neutrophil transmigration across an activated endothelium and for inducible nitric oxide synthase production upon HGF stimulation. Consequently, HGF/MET-dependent nitric oxide release by neutrophils promotes cancer cell killing, which abates tumour growth and metastasis. After systemic administration of a MET kinase inhibitor, we prove that the therapeutic benefit of MET targeting in cancer cells is partly countered by the pro-tumoural effect arising from MET blockade in neutrophils. Our work identifies an unprecedented role of MET in neutrophils, suggests a potential 'Achilles' heel' of MET-targeted therapies in cancer, and supports the rationale for evaluating anti-MET drugs in certain inflammatory diseases.","[Finisguerra, Veronica; Di Conza, Giusy; Di Matteo, Mario; Serneels, Jens; Costa, Sandra; Casazza, Andrea; Mazzone, Massimiliano] VIB, Vesalius Res Ctr, Lab Mol Oncol & Angiogenesis, B-3000 Leuven, Belgium; [Finisguerra, Veronica; Di Conza, Giusy; Di Matteo, Mario; Serneels, Jens; Costa, Sandra; Casazza, Andrea; Mazzone, Massimiliano] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Dept Oncol, Vesalius Res Ctr, Lab Mol Oncol & Angiogenesis, B-3000 Leuven, Belgium; [Costa, Sandra] Univ Minho, Sch Hlth Sci, Life & Hlth Sci Res Inst ICVS, P-4710057 Braga, Portugal; [Costa, Sandra] ICVS 3Bs PT Govt Associate Lab, P-4710057 Braga, Portugal; [Thompson, A.

Constant ER turnover and modulation is needed to meet different cellular requirements and autophagy has an important role in this process(2-8). However, its underlying regulatory mechanisms remain unexplained. Here we show that members of the FAM134 reticulon protein family are ER-resident receptors that bind to autophagy modifiers LC3 and GABARAP, and facilitate ER degradation by autophagy ('ER-phagy'). Downregulation of FAM134B protein in human cells causes an expansion of the ER, while FAM134B overexpression results in ER fragmentation and lysosomal degradation. Mutant FAM134B proteins that cause sensory neuropathy in humans(9) are unable to act as ER-phagy receptors. Consistently, disruption of Fam134b in mice causes expansion of the ER, inhibits ER turnover, sensitizes cells to stress-induced apoptotic cell death and leads to degeneration of sensory neurons. Therefore, selective ER-phagy via FAM134 proteins is indispensable for mammalian cell homeostasis and controls ER morphology and turnover in mice and humans.","[Khaminets, Aliaksandr; Grumati, Paolo; Stolz, Alexandra; Dikic, Ivan] Goethe Univ Frankfurt, Sch Med, Inst Biochem 2, D-60590 Frankfurt, Germany; [Heinrich, Theresa; Huebner, Antje K.; Liebmann, Lutz; Kurth, Ingo; Huebner, Christian A.] Univ Jena, Inst Human Genet, Jena Univ Hosp, D-07743 Jena, Germany; [Mari, Muriel; Mauthe, Mario; Reggiori, Fulvio] Univ Med Ctr Utrecht, Ctr Mol Med, Dept Cell Biol, NL-3584 CX Utrecht, Netherlands; [Mari, Muriel; Reggiori, Fulvio] Univ Groningen, Univ Med Ctr Groningen, Dept Cell Biol, NL-9713 AV Groningen, Netherlands; [Akutsu, Masato] Goethe Univ Frankfurt, Buchmann Inst Mol Life Sci, D-60438 Frankfurt, Germany; [Nietzsche, Sandor] Univ Jena, Jena Univ Hosp, Electron Microscopy Ctr, D-07743 Jena, Germany; [Koch, Nicole; Qualmann, Britta] Univ Jena, Jena Univ Hosp, Inst Biochem 1, D-07743 Jena, Germany; [Katona, Istvan; Weis, Joachim] RWTH Aachen Univ Hosp, Inst Neuropathol, D-52074 Aachen, Germany; [Dikic, Ivan] Univ Split, Sch Med, Inst Immunol, Mestrovicevo Setaliste B 21000, Split, Croatia","Dikic, I (reprint author), Goethe Univ Frankfurt, Sch Med, Inst Biochem 2, Theodor Stern Kai 7, D-60590 Frankfurt, Germany.",Ingo.Kurth@med.uni-jena.de; Christian.Huebner@med.uni-jena.de; Ivan.Dikic@biochem2.de,"Weis, Joachim/G-1984-2014; Dikic, Ivan/O-4650-2015; Katona, Istvan/I-6704-2016; akutsu, masato/L-4095-2016; Hubner, Christian/A-2950-2017","Weis, Joachim/0000-0003-3280-6773; Dikic, Ivan/0000-0001-8156-9511; Katona, Istvan/0000-0002-0955-8911; akutsu, masato/0000-0002-9839-3345; Hubner, Christian/0000-0002-1030-4943; Reggiori, Fulvio/0000-0003-2652-2686; Mauthe, Mario/0000-0003-0049-7961; Kurth, Ingo/0000-0002-5642-8378","Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft [DI 931/3-1, KU 1587/2-1, KU 1587/3-1, KU 1587/4-1, HU 800/5-1]; RTG [1715, HU 800/6-1, HU 800/7-1, QU116/6-2, RTG1715, WE1406/13-1]; Cluster of Excellence 'Macromolecular Complexes' of the Goethe University Frankfurt [EXC115]; LOEWE grant Ub-Net; LOEWE Centrum for Gene and Cell therapy Frankfurt; European Research Council/ERC [250241-LineUb]; ECHO [700.59.003]; ALW Open Program [821.02.017, 822.02.014]; DFG-NWO cooperation [DN82-303]; ZonMW VICI [016.130.606]; 7.FP, COFUND, Goethe International Postdoc Programme GO-IN [291776]","We would like to thank S.

In selective autophagy, receptor proteins recognize degradation targets and direct their sequestration by double-membrane vesicles called autophagosomes, which transport them into lysosomes or vacuoles(3). Although recent studies have shown that selective autophagy is involved in quality/quantity control of some organelles, including mitochondria and peroxisomes(4), it remains unclear how extensively it contributes to cellular organelle homeostasis. Here we describe selective autophagy of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and nucleus in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We identify two novel proteins, Atg39 and Atg40, as receptors specific to these pathways. Atg39 localizes to the perinuclear ER (or the nuclear envelope) and induces autophagic sequestration of part of the nucleus. Atg40 is enriched in the cortical and cytoplasmic ER, and loads these ER subdomains into autophagosomes. Atg39-dependent autophagy of the perinuclear ER/nucleus is required for cell survival under nitrogen-deprivation conditions. Atg40 is probably the functional counterpart of FAM134B, an autophagy receptor for the ER in mammals that has been implicated in sensory neuropathy(5).

Here we show in human cell lines that alternative 3' UTRs differentially regulate the localization of membrane proteins. The long 3' UTR of CD47 enables efficient cell surface expression of CD47 protein, whereas the short 3' UTR primarily localizes CD47 protein to the endoplasmic reticulum. CD47 protein localization occurs post-translationally and independently of RNA localization. In our model of 3' UTR-dependent protein localization, the long 3' UTR of CD47 acts as a scaffold to recruit a protein complex containing the RNA-binding protein HuR (also known as ELAVL1) and SET4 to the site of translation. This facilitates interaction of SET with the newly translated cytoplasmic domains of CD47 and results in subsequent translocation of CD47 to the plasma membrane via activated RAC1 (ref. 5). We also show that CD47 protein has different functions depending on whether it was generated by the short or long 3' UTR isoforms. Thus, ApA contributes to the functional diversity of the proteome without changing the amino acid sequence. 3' UTR-dependent protein localization has the potential to be a widespread trafficking mechanism for membrane proteins because HuR binds to thousands of mRNAs(6-9), and we show that the long 3' UTRs of CD44, ITGA1 and TNFRSF13C, which are bound by HuR, increase surface protein expression compared to their corresponding short 3' UTRs. We propose that during translation the scaffold function of 3' UTRs facilitates binding of proteins to nascent proteins to direct their transport or function-and this role of 3' UTRs can be regulated by ApA.","[Berkovits, Binyamin D.; Mayr, Christine] Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Canc Biol & Genet Program, New York, NY 10065 USA","Mayr, C (reprint author), Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Canc Biol & Genet Program, 1275 York Ave, New York, NY 10065 USA.",mayrc@mskcc.org,,,Damon Runyon-Rachleff Cancer Foundation; Island Outreach Foundation [DRR-24-13]; National Institutes of Health [U01-CA164190];  [P30 CA008748],"This work was funded by the Innovator Award of the Damon Runyon-Rachleff Cancer Foundation and the Island Outreach Foundation (DRR-24-13) and National Institutes of Health grant U01-CA164190.

Furthermore, synthetic RNAs have applications as therapeutics and molecular sensors. Both research and technological applications of RNA would be dramatically enhanced by methods that enable incorporation of modified or labelled nucleotides into specifically designated positions or regions of RNA. However, the synthesis of tens of milligrams of such RNAs using existing methods has been impossible. Here we develop a hybrid solid-liquid phase transcription method and automated robotic platform for the synthesis of RNAs with position-selective labelling. We demonstrate its use by successfully preparing various isotope- or fluorescently labelled versions of the 71-nucleotide aptamer domain of an adenine riboswitch(1) for nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy or single-molecule Forster resonance energy transfer, respectively. Those RNAs includemolecules that were selectively isotope-labelled in specific loops, linkers, a helix, several discrete positions, or a single internal position, as well as RNA molecules that were fluorescently labelled in and near kissing loops. These selectively labelled RNAs have the same fold as those transcribed using conventional methods, but they greatly simplify the interpretation of NMR spectra. The single-position isotope-and fluorescently labelled RNA samples reveal multiple conformational states of the adenine riboswitch. Lastly, we describe a robotic platform- and the operation that automates this technology. Our selective labelling method may be useful for studying RNA structure and dynamics and for making RNA sensors for a variety of applications including cell-biological studies, substance detection(2), and disease diagnostics(3,4).","[Liu, Yu; Wang, Jinbu; Stagno, Jason R.; Wang, Yun-Xing] NCI, Prot Nucle Acid Interact Sect, Struct Biophys Lab, Ctr Canc Res,NIH, Frederick, MD 21702 USA; [Holmstrom, Erik; Nesbitt, David J.] Univ Colorado, NIST, Joint Inst Lab Astrophys, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Holmstrom, Erik; Nesbitt, David J.] Univ Colorado, Dept Chem & Biochem, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Zhang, Jinwei; Ferre-D'Amare, Adrian R.] NHLBI, Biochem & Biophys Ctr, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Yu, Ping; Dyba, Marzena A.] Leidos Biomed Res Inc, Frederick Natl Lab Canc Res, Basic Sci Program, Struct Biophys Lab, Frederick, MD 21702 USA; [Chen, De; Lockett, Stephen] Leidos Biomed Res Inc, Frederick Natl Lab Canc Res, Opt Microscopy & Anal Lab, Frederick, MD 21702 USA; [Ying, Jinfa] NIDDK, Lab Chem Phys, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Sousa, Rui] Univ Texas Hlth Sci Ctr San Antonio, Dept Biochem, San Antonio, TX 78229 USA","Wang, YX (reprint author), NCI, Prot Nucle Acid Interact Sect, Struct Biophys Lab, Ctr Canc Res,NIH, Frederick, MD 21702 USA.",wangyunx@mail.nih.gov,,,"National Cancer Institute, the National Institute of Diabetes, Digestive and Kidney Diseases, the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute; Intramural Antiviral Target Program (IATAP) of the Office of the Director, National Institutes of Health; National Institutes of Health; National Cancer Institute [HHSN261200800001E]; National Science Foundation [CHE1266416, PHYS1125844]; National Institutes of Health Molecular Biophysics Training Program [T32 GM-065103]; W.

However, there is debate about whether these changes resulted from the circulation of ideas or from human migrations, potentially also facilitating the spread of languages and certain phenotypic traits. We investigated this by using new, improved methods to sequence low-coverage genomes from 101 ancient humans from across Eurasia. We show that the Bronze Age was a highly dynamic period involving large-scale population migrations and replacements, responsible for shaping major parts of present-day demographic structure in both Europe and Asia. Our findings are consistent with the hypothesized spread of Indo-European languages during the Early Bronze Age. We also demonstrate that light skin pigmentation in Europeans was already present at high frequency in the Bronze Age, but not lactose tolerance, indicating a more recent onset of positive selection on lactose tolerance than previously thought.","[Allentoft, Morten E.; Sikora, Martin; Rasmussen, Morten; Stenderup, Jesper; Damgaard, Peter B.; Schroeder, Hannes; Vinner, Lasse; Malaspinas, Anna-Sapfo; Margaryan, Ashot; Orlando, Ludovic; Willerslev, Eske] Univ Copenhagen, Ctr GeoGenet, Nat Hist Museum, DK-1350 Copenhagen K, Denmark; [Sjogren, Karl-Goran; Pokutta, Dalia; Kristiansen, Kristian] Univ Gothenburg, Dept Hist Studies, S-40530 Gothenburg, Sweden; [Rasmussen, Simon; Sicheritz-Ponten, Thomas; Brunak, Soren] Tech Univ Denmark, Dept Syst Biol, Ctr Biol Sequence Anal, DK-2800 Lyngby, Denmark; [Schroeder, Hannes] Leiden Univ, Fac Archaeol, NL-2300 Leiden, Netherlands; [Ahlstrom, Torbjorn] Lund Univ, Dept Archaeol & Ancient Hist, S-22100 Lund, Sweden; [Higham, Tom; Chivall, David] Univ Oxford, Oxford Radiocarbon Accelerator Unit, Oxford OX1 3QY, England; [Lynnerup, Niels; Harvig, Lise] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Forens Med, Unit Forens Anthropol, DK-2100 Copenhagen, Denmark; [Baron, Justyna; Furmanek, Miroslaw; Gralak, Tomasz; Lasak, Irena] Univ Wroclaw, Inst Archaeol, PL-50139 Wroclaw, Poland; [Della Casa, Philippe] Univ Zurich, Archaeol Inst, CH-8006 Zurich, Switzerland; [Dabrowski, Pawel] Wroclaw Med Univ, Dept Anat, PL-50368 Wroclaw, Poland; [Duffy, Paul R.] Univ Toronto, Dept Anthropol, Toronto, ON M5S 2S2, Canada; [Ebel, Alexander V.] Gorno Altaisk State Univ, Dept Archeol & Gen Hist, Gorno Altaisk 649000, Russia; [Epimakhov, Andrey] South Ural State Univ, South Ural Dept, Inst Hist & Archaeol RAS, Chelyabinsk 454080, Russia; [Frei, Karin] Natl Museum Denmark, Environm Res & Mat Sci, DK-1471 Copenhagen K, Denmark; [Frei, Karin] Natl Museum Denmark, Ctr Text Res, DK-1471 Copenhagen K, Denmark; [Gromov, Andrey; Khartanovich, Valeri; Moiseyev, Vyacheslav] Peter Great Museum Anthropol & Ethnog Kunstkamera, St Petersburg 199034, Russia; [Gronkiewicz, Stanislaw] Polish Acad Sci, Dept Anthropol, PL-50449 Wroclaw, Poland; [Grupe, Gisela; McGlynn, George] Univ Munich, Bioctr, D-82152 Munich, Germany; [Hajdu, Tamas] Eotvos Lorand Univ, Inst Biol, Dept Biol Anthropol, H-1117 Budapest, Hungary; [Hajdu, Tamas] Hungarian Nat Hist Museum, Dept Anthropol, H-1083 Budapest, Hungary; [Jarysz, Radoslaw] Archaeol Museum Wroclaw, PL-50077 Wroclaw, Poland; [Khokhlov, Alexandr] Samara State Acad Social Sci & Humanities, Samara 443099, Russia; [Kiss, Viktoria; Szeverenyi, Vajk] Hungarian Acad Sci, Res Ctr Humanities, Inst Archaeol, H-1250 Budapest, Hungary; [Kolar, Jan] Masaryk Univ, Fac Arts, Inst Archaeol & Museol, CZ-60200 Brno, Czech Republic; [Kolar, Jan] Acad Sci Czech Republic, Inst Bot, Dept Vegetat Ecol, CZ-60200 Brno, Czech Republic; [Kriiska, Aivar; Varul, Liivi] Univ Tartu, Dept Archaeol, EE-51003 Tartu, Estonia; [Longhi, Cristina] Archaeol Superintendence Lombardy, I-20123 Milan, Italy; [Merkevicius, Algimantas] Vilnius State Univ, Dept Archaeol, LT-01513 Vilnius, Lithuania; [Merkyte, Inga] Univ Copenhagen, SAXO Inst, DK-2300 Copenhagen S, Denmark; [Metspalu, Mait; Saag, Lehti] Estonian Bioctr, Dept Evolutionary Biol, EE-51010 Tartu, Estonia; [Metspalu, Mait; Saag, Lehti] Univ Tartu, EE-51010 Tartu, Estonia; [Mkrtchyan, Ruzan] Yerevan State Univ, Dept Hist, Yerevan 0025, Armenia; [Paja, Laszlo] Hungarian Natl Museum, H-1083 Budapest, Hungary; [Paja, Laszlo; Palfi, Gyoergy] Univ Szeged, Dept Biol Anthropol, H-6726 Szeged, Hungary; [Pospieszny, Lukasz] Polish Acad Sci, Inst Archaeol & Ethnol, PL-61612 Poznan, Poland; [Price, T.

Here we demonstrate the cloning and propagation of highly clonogenic, 'ground state' stem cells of the human intestine and colon. We show that derived stem-cell pedigrees sustain limited copy number and sequence variation despite extensive serial passaging and display exquisitely precise, cell-autonomous commitment to epithelial differentiation consistent with their origins along the intestinal tract. This developmentally patterned and epigenetically maintained commitment of stem cells is likely to enforce the functional specificity of the adult intestinal tract. Using clonally derived colonic epithelia, we show that toxins A or B of the enteric pathogen Clostridium difficile recapitulate the salient features of pseudomembranous colitis. The stability of the epigenetic commitment programs of these stem cells, coupled with their unlimited replicative expansion and maintained clonogenicity, suggests certain advantages for their use in disease modelling and regenerative medicine.","[Wang, Xia; Yamamoto, Yusuke; Wilson, Lane H.; Ning, Gang; Hong, Yue; Chevalier, Benoit; McKeon, Frank; Xian, Wa] Jackson Lab Genom Med, Farmington, CT 06032 USA; [Wilson, Lane H.; Xian, Wa] Univ Connecticut, Ctr Hlth, Dept Genet & Dev Biol, Farmington, CT 06032 USA; [Zhang, Ting; Kern, Florian; Khor, Chiea Chuen; Bertrand, Denis; Wu, Lingyan; Nagarajan, Niranjan; McKeon, Frank] Agcy Sci Technol & Res, Genome Inst Singapore, Singapore 138672, Singapore; [Howitt, Brooke E.; Crum, Christopher P.; Xian, Wa] Brigham & Womens Hosp, Dept Pathol, Boston, MA 02118 USA; [Farrow, Melissa A.; Lacy, D.

Chromothripsis is characterized by extensive genomic rearrangements and an oscillating pattern of DNA copy number levels, all curiously restricted to one or a few chromosomes. The mechanism for chromothripsis is unknown, but we previously proposed that it could occur through the physical isolation of chromosomes in aberrant nuclear structures called micronuclei. Here, using a combination of live cell imaging and single-cell genome sequencing, we demonstrate that micronucleus formation can indeed generate a spectrum of genomic rearrangements, some of which recapitulate all known features of chromothripsis. These events are restricted to the mis-segregated chromosome and occur within one cell division. We demonstrate that the mechanism for chromothripsis can involve the fragmentation and subsequent reassembly of a single chromatid from a micronucleus. Collectively, these experiments establish a new mutational process of which chromothripsis is one extreme outcome.","[Zhang, Cheng-Zhong; Francis, Joshua M.; Meyerson, Matthew] Dana Farber Canc Inst, Dept Med Oncol, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Zhang, Cheng-Zhong; Spektor, Alexander; Cornils, Hauke; Jackson, Emily K.; Liu, Shiwei; Pellman, David] Dana Farber Canc Inst, Dept Pediat Oncol, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Zhang, Cheng-Zhong; Francis, Joshua M.; Meyerson, Matthew; Pellman, David] Broad Inst Harvard & MIT, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; [Zhang, Cheng-Zhong; Spektor, Alexander; Cornils, Hauke; Jackson, Emily K.; Liu, Shiwei; Pellman, David] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Cell Biol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Spektor, Alexander] Dana Farber Canc Inst, Dept Radiat Oncol, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Jackson, Emily K.; Pellman, David] Howard Hughes Med Inst, Chevy Chase, MD 20815 USA; [Meyerson, Matthew] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Pathol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Meyerson, Matthew] Dana Farber Canc Inst, Ctr Canc Genome Discovery, Boston, MA 02215 USA","Pellman, D (reprint author), Dana Farber Canc Inst, Dept Pediat Oncol, Boston, MA 02215 USA.",david_pellman@dfci.harvard.edu,,"Meyerson, Matthew/0000-0002-9133-8108",Bridge Project of the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute; Koch Institute of MIT; Claudia Adams Barr Program in Innovative Cancer Research; NIH [GM083299-18],"We thank R.

The ring was detected(1) between distances of 128 and 207 Saturn radii (R-S 5 60,330 kilometres) from the planet, with a full vertical extent of 40R(S), making it well over ten times larger than Saturn's hitherto largest known ring, the E ring. The total radial extent of the Phoebe ring could not, however, be determined at that time, nor could particle sizes be significantly constrained. Here we report infrared imaging of the entire ring, which extends from 100R(S) out to a surprisingly distant 270R(S). We model the orbital dynamics of ring particles launched from Phoebe, and construct theoretical power-law profiles of the particle size distribution. We find that very steep profiles fit the data best, and that elevated grain temperatures, arising because of the radiative inefficiency of the smallest grains, probably contribute to the steepness. By converting our constraint on particle sizes into a form that is independent of the uncertain size distribution, we determine that particles with radii greater than ten centimetres, whose orbits do not decay appreciably inward over 4.5 billion years, contribute at most about ten per cent to the cross-sectional area of the ring's dusty component.","[Hamilton, Douglas P.] Univ Maryland, Dept Astron, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Skrutskie, Michael F.; Verbiscer, Anne J.] Univ Virginia, Dept Astron, Charlottesville, VA 22904 USA; [Masci, Frank J.] CALTECH, Ctr Infrared Proc & Anal, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA","Hamilton, DP (reprint author), Univ Maryland, Dept Astron, College Pk, MD 20742 USA.",dphamil@umd.edu,,,National Aeronautics and Space Administration; NASA Outer Planets and Origins,"This publication makes use of data products from the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, which is a joint project of the University of California, Los Angeles, and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory/California Institute of Technology, funded by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.

But a fully consistent model has not yet been constructed and debate continues, in particular about the possibility of coronal plasma being heated by energetic phenomena observed in the chromosphere(2,3,8-11). Here we report modelling of the heating of the quiet Sun, in which magnetic fields are generated by a subphotospheric fluid dynamo intrinsically connected to granulation. We find that the fields expand into the chromosphere, where plasma is heated at the rate required to match observations (4,500 watts per square metre) by small-scale eruptions that release magnetic energy and drive sonic motions. Some energetic eruptions can even reach heights of 10 million metres above the surface of the Sun, thereby affecting the very low corona. Extending the model by also taking into account the vertical weak network magnetic field allows for the existence of a mechanism able to heat the corona above, while leaving unchanged the physics of chromospheric eruptions. Such a mechanism rests on the eventual dissipation of Alfven waves generated inside the chromosphere and that carry upwards the required energy flux of 300 watts per square metre. The model shows a topologically complex magnetic field of 160 gauss on the Sun's surface, agreeing with inferences obtained from spectropolarimetric observations(12-14), chromospheric features (contributing only weakly to the coronal heating) that can be identified with observed spicules(9) and blinkers(10,11), and vortices that may be possibly associated with observed solar tornadoes(8).","[Amari, Tahar; Luciani, Jean-Francois] Ecole Polytech, Ctr Phys Theor, CNRS, F-91128 Palaiseau, France; [Aly, Jean-Jacques] Univ Paris 07, Ctr Etud Saclay, AIM Unite Mixte Rech CEA CNRS, UMR 7158, F-91191 Gif Sur Yvette, France","Amari, T (reprint author), Ecole Polytech, Ctr Phys Theor, CNRS, F-91128 Palaiseau, France.",tahar.amari@polytechnique.edu,,,Centre National d'Etudes Spatiales (CNES),"We thank A.

Although they can serve as the basis for unique optical devices that mould the flow of light in unconventional ways, three-dimensional metamaterials suffer from extreme propagation losses(8,9). Two-dimensional metamaterials (metasurfaces) such as hyperbolic metasurfaces for propagating surface plasmon polaritons(10,11) have the potential to alleviate this problem. Because the surface plasmon polaritons are guided at a metal-dielectric interface (rather than passing through metallic components), these hyperbolic metasurfaces have been predicted to suffer much lower propagation loss while still exhibiting optical phenomena akin to those in three-dimensional metamaterials. Moreover, because of their planar nature, these devices enable the construction of integrated metamaterial circuits as well as easy coupling with other optoelectronic elements. Here we report the experimental realization of a visible-frequency hyperbolic metasurface using single-crystal silver nanostructures defined by lithographic and etching techniques. The resulting devices display the characteristic properties of metamaterials, such as negative refraction(1-5) and diffraction-free propagation(6,7), with device performance greatly exceeding those of previous demonstrations. Moreover, hyperbolic metasurfaces exhibit strong, dispersion-dependent spin-orbit coupling, enabling polarization-and wavelength-dependent routeing of surface plasmon polaritons and two-dimensional chiral optical components(12-15). These results open the door to realizing integrated optical meta-circuits, with wide-ranging applications in areas from imaging and sensing to quantum optics and quantum information science.","[High, Alexander A.; Polking, Mark; de Leon, Nathalie P.; Park, Hongkun] Harvard Univ, Dept Chem & Chem Biol, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [High, Alexander A.; Wild, Dominik S.; Perczel, Janos; de Leon, Nathalie P.; Lukin, Mikhail D.; Park, Hongkun] Harvard Univ, Dept Phys, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Devlin, Robert C.; Dibos, Alan] Harvard Univ, Sch Engn & Appl Sci, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Perczel, Janos] MIT, Dept Phys, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA","Park, H (reprint author), Harvard Univ, Dept Chem & Chem Biol, 12 Oxford St, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",lukin@physics.harvard.edu; hongkun_park@harvard.edu,"High, Alexander/E-2541-2012","High, Alexander/0000-0003-0428-5448",ONR-MURI [FA9550-12-1-0024]; NSF-AMO [PHY-0969816]; NSF-CUA [PHY-1125846]; DARPA SPARQC [W31P4Q-12-1-0017],"We acknowledge support from ONR-MURI (FA9550-12-1-0024), NSF-AMO (PHY-0969816), NSF-CUA (PHY-1125846) and DARPA SPARQC (W31P4Q-12-1-0017).

But the extent to which T-I is representative of previous terminations remains unclear. Testing the consistency of termination processes requires comparison of time series of critical climate parameters with detailed absolute and relative age control. However, such age control has been lacking for even the penultimate glacial termination (T-II), which culminated in a sea-level highstand during the last interglacial period that was several metres above present(4). Here we show that Heinrich Stadial 11 (HS11), a prominent North Atlantic cold episode(5,6), occurred between 135 +/- 1 and 130 +/- 2 thousand years ago and was linked with rapid sea-level rise during T-II. Our conclusions are based on new and existing(6-9) data for T-II and the last interglacial that we collate onto a single, radiometrically constrained chronology. The HS11 cold episode(5,6) punctuated T-II and coincided directly with a major deglacial meltwater pulse, which predominantly entered the North Atlantic Ocean and accounted for about 70 per cent of the glacial-interglacial sea-level rise(8,9). We conclude that, possibly in response to stronger insolation and CO2 forcing earlier in T-II, the relationship between climate and ice-volume changes differed fundamentally from that of T-I. In T-I, the major sea-level rise clearly post-dates(3,10,11) Heinrich Stadial 1. We also find that HS11 coincided with sustained Antarctic warming, probably through a bipolar seesaw temperature response(12), and propose that this heat gain at high southern latitudes promoted Antarctic ice-sheet melting that fuelled the last interglacial sea-level peak.","[Marino, G.; Rohling, E.

The transition from rheologically stronger lithosphere to weaker asthenosphere may result from a small amount of melt or water in the asthenosphere, reducing viscosity(1-3). Either possibility may explain the seismic and electrical anomalies that extend to a depth of about 200 kilometres(4,5). However, the effect of melt on the physical properties of deformed materials at upper-mantle conditions remains poorly constrained(6). Here we present electrical anisotropy measurements at high temperatures and quasi-hydrostatic pressures of about three gigapascals on previously deformed olivine aggregates and sheared partially molten rocks. For all samples, electrical conductivity is highest when parallel to the direction of prior deformation. The conductivity of highly sheared olivine samples is ten times greater in the shear direction than for undeformed samples. At temperatures above 900 degrees Celsius, a deformed solid matrix with nearly isotropic melt distribution has an electrical anisotropy factor less than five. To obtain higher electrical anisotropy (up to a factor of 100), we propose an experimentally based model in which layers of sheared olivine are alternated with layers of sheared olivine plus MORB or of pure melt. Conductivities are up to 100 times greater in the shear direction than when perpendicular to the shear direction and reproduce stress-driven alignment of the melt. Our experimental results and the model reproduce mantle conductivity-depth profiles for melt-bearing geological contexts. The field data are best fitted by an electrically anisotropic asthenosphere overlain by an isotropic, high-conductivity lower most lithosphere. The high conductivity could arise from partial melting associated with localized deformation resulting from differential plate velocities relative to the mantle, with subsequent upward melt percolation from the asthenosphere.","[Pommier, Anne] Univ Calif San Diego, Scripps Inst Oceanog, Inst Geophys & Planetary Phys, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Pommier, Anne; Garnero, Edward J.; Tyburczy, James A.] Arizona State Univ, Sch Earth & Space Explorat, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA; [Leinenweber, Kurt] Arizona State Univ, Dept Chem & Biochem, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA; [Kohlstedt, David L.; Qi, Chao] Univ Minnesota, Dept Earth Sci, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA; [Mackwell, Stephen J.] Univ Space Res Assoc, Lunar & Planetary Inst, Houston, TX 77058 USA","Pommier, A (reprint author), Univ Calif San Diego, Scripps Inst Oceanog, Inst Geophys & Planetary Phys, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.",pommier@ucsd.edu,,"Mackwell, Stephen/0000-0002-0996-1348","NSF through Cooperative Studies of the Earth's Deep Interior (CSEDI) [1461594, 1265395, 1265428]; COMPRES (the Consortium for Materials Properties Research in Earth Sciences) under National Science Foundation (NSF) [EAR 11-57758]","This work benefited from funding by the NSF through Cooperative Studies of the Earth's Deep Interior (CSEDI) projects number 1461594 to the University of California San Diego, number 1265395 to Arizona State University, and number 1265428 to the University of Minnesota.

Enrichment of these positions decreases the sequencing required for genome-wide ancient DNA analysis by a median of around 250-fold, allowing us to study an order of magnitude more individuals than previous studies(1-8) and to obtain new insights about the past. We show that the populations of Western and Far Eastern Europe followed opposite trajectories between 8,000-5,000 years ago. At the beginning of the Neolithic period in Europe, similar to 8,000-7,000 years ago, closely related groups of early farmers appeared in Germany, Hungary and Spain, different from indigenous hunter-gatherers, whereas Russia was inhabited by a distinctive population of hunter-gatherers with high affinity to a similar to 24,000-year-old Siberian(6). By similar to 6,000-5,000 years ago, farmers throughout much of Europe had more hunter-gatherer ancestry than their predecessors, but in Russia, the Yamnaya steppe herders of this time were descended not only from the preceding eastern European hunter-gatherers, but also from a population of Near Eastern ancestry. Western and Eastern Europe came into contact similar to 4,500 years ago, as the Late Neolithic Corded Ware people from Germany traced similar to 75% of their ancestry to the Yamnaya, documenting a massive migration into the heartland of Europe from its eastern periphery. This steppe ancestry persisted in all sampled central Europeans until at least similar to 3,000 years ago, and is ubiquitous in present-day Europeans. These results provide support for a steppe origin(9) of at least some of the Indo-European languages of Europe.","[Haak, Wolfgang; Llamas, Bastien; Cooper, Alan] Univ Adelaide, Sch Earth & Environm Sci, Australian Ctr Ancient DNA, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia; [Haak, Wolfgang; Llamas, Bastien; Cooper, Alan] Univ Adelaide, Inst Environm, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia; [Lazaridis, Iosif; Rohland, Nadin; Mallick, Swapan; Nordenfelt, Susanne; Harney, Eadaoin; Stewardson, Kristin; Fu, Qiaomei; Reich, David] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Genet, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Lazaridis, Iosif; Patterson, Nick; Rohland, Nadin; Mallick, Swapan; Nordenfelt, Susanne; Harney, Eadaoin; Stewardson, Kristin; Fu, Qiaomei; Reich, David] Broad Inst Harvard & MIT, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; [Mallick, Swapan; Harney, Eadaoin; Stewardson, Kristin; Reich, David] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Brandt, Guido; Nicklisch, Nicole; Roth, Christina; Szecsenyi-Nagy, Anna; Alt, Kurt Werner] Johannes Gutenberg Univ Mainz, Inst Anthropol, D-55128 Mainz, Germany; [Fu, Qiaomei; Meyer, Matthias] Max Planck Inst Evolutionary Anthropol, D-04103 Leipzig, Germany; [Fu, Qiaomei] Chinese Acad Sci, IVPP, Key Lab Vertebrate Evolut & Human Origins, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China; [Mittnik, Alissa; Krause, Johannes] Univ Tubingen, Inst Archaeol Sci, D-72070 Tubingen, Germany; [Banffy, Eszter; Szecsenyi-Nagy, Anna] Hungarian Acad Sci, Inst Archaeol, Res Ctr Humanities, H-1014 Budapest, Hungary; [Banffy, Eszter] RGK, D-60325 Frankfurt, Germany; [Economou, Christos] Stockholm Univ, Archaeol Res Lab, S-11418 Stockholm, Sweden; [Francken, Michael; Krause, Johannes] Univ Tubingen, Senckenberg Ctr Human Evolut & Paleoenvironm, Dept Paleoanthropol, D-72070 Tubingen, Germany; [Francken, Michael; Krause, Johannes] Univ Tubingen, Senckenberg Ctr Human Evolut & Paleoenvironm, Dept Archaeogenet, D-72070 Tubingen, Germany; [Friederich, Susanne; Meller, Harald; Nicklisch, Nicole; Alt, Kurt Werner] Saxony Anhalt & State Museum Prehist, State Off Heritage Management & Archaeol, D-06114 Halle, Germany; [Pena, Rafael Garrido] Univ Autonoma Madrid, Fac Filosofia & Letras, Dept Prehist & Arqueol, E-28049 Madrid, Spain; [Hallgren, Fredrik] Cultural Heritage Fdn, S-72212 Vasteras, Sweden; [Khartanovich, Valery; Moiseyev, Vayacheslav] Peter Great Museum Anthropol & Ethnog Kunstkamera, St Petersburg 199034, Russia; [Khokhlov, Aleksandr; Kuznetsov, Pavel; Mochalov, Oleg] Volga State Acad Social Sci & Humanities, Samara 443099, Russia; [Kunst, Michael] Deutsch Archaeol Inst, Abt Madrid, E-28002 Madrid, Spain; [Nicklisch, Nicole; Alt, Kurt Werner] Danube Private Univ, A-3500 Krems, Austria; [Pichler, Sandra L.; Alt, Kurt Werner] Univ Basel, Inst Prehist & Archaeol Sci, CH-4003 Basel, Switzerland; [Risch, Roberto] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Dept Prehist, E-08193 Barcelona, Spain; [Rojo Guerra, Manuel A.] Univ Valladolid, Dept Prehist & Arqueol, E-47002 Valladolid, Spain; [Wahl, Joachim] State Off Cultural Heritage Management Baden Wurt, D-78467 Constance, Germany; [Krause, Johannes] Max Planck Inst Sci Human Hist, D-07745 Jena, Germany; [Brown, Dorcas; Anthony, David] Hartwick Coll, Dept Anthropol, Oneonta, NY 13820 USA","Reich, D (reprint author), Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Genet, Boston, MA 02115 USA.",reich@genetics.med.harvard.edu,"Khokhlov, Aleksander/F-4737-2017; Risch, Roberto/L-4115-2014","Khokhlov, Aleksander/0000-0003-0442-9616; Risch, Roberto/0000-0001-8534-5806; Pichler, Sandra L./0000-0002-5557-1674; Szecsenyi-Nagy, Anna/0000-0003-2095-738X; Llamas, Bastien/0000-0002-5550-9176; GARRIDO PENA,  RAFAEL/0000-0001-8263-2949","Australian Research Council [DP130102158]; German Research Foundation [Al 287/7-1, 7-3, Al 287/10-1, Al 287/14-1, Me 3245/1-1, 1-3]; US National Science Foundation HOMINID grant [BCS-1032255]; US National Institutes of Health [GM100233]; Howard Hughes Medical Institute","We thank P.

Metabolic energy used during walking can be partly replaced by power input from an exoskeleton(2), but is it possible to reduce metabolic rate without providing an additional energy source? This would require an improvement in the efficiency of the human-machine system as a whole, and would be remarkable given the apparent optimality of human gait. Here we show that the metabolic rate of human walking can be reduced by an unpowered ankle exoskeleton. We built a lightweight elastic device that acts in parallel with the user's calf muscles, off-loading muscle force and thereby reducing the metabolic energy consumed in contractions. The device uses a mechanical clutch to hold a spring as it is stretched and relaxed by ankle movements when the foot is on the ground, helping to fulfil one function of the calf muscles and Achilles tendon. Unlike muscles, however, the clutch sustains force passively. The exoskeleton consumes no chemical or electrical energy and delivers no net positive mechanical work, yet reduces the metabolic cost of walking by 7.2 +/- 2.6% for healthy human users under natural conditions, comparable to savings with powered devices. Improving upon walking economy in this way is analogous to altering the structure of the body such that it is more energy-effective at walking. While strong natural pressures have already shaped human locomotion, improvements in efficiency are still possible. Much remains to be learned about this seemingly simple behaviour.","[Collins, Steven H.] Carnegie Mellon Univ, Dept Mech Engn, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA; [Wiggin, M.

Prevention of neural degeneration and subsequent disability requires remyelination through the generation of new oligodendrocytes, but current treatments exclusively target the immune system. Oligodendrocyte progenitor cells are stem cells in the central nervous system and the principal source of myelinating oligodendrocytes(1). These cells are abundant in demyelinated regions of patients with multiple sclerosis, yet fail to differentiate, thereby representing a cellular target for pharmacological intervention(2). To discover therapeutic compounds for enhancing myelination from endogenous oligodendrocyte progenitor cells, we screened a library of bioactive small molecules on mouse pluripotent epiblast stem-cell-derived oligodendrocyte progenitor cells(3-5). Here we show seven drugs function at nanomolar doses selectively to enhance the generation of mature oligodendrocytes from progenitor cells in vitro. Two drugs, miconazole and clobetasol, are effective in promoting precocious myelination in organotypic cerebellar slice cultures, and in vivo in early postnatal mouse pups. Systemic delivery of each of the two drugs significantly increases the number of new oligodendrocytes and enhances remyelination in a lysolecithin-induced mouse model of focal demyelination. Administering each of the two drugs at the peak of disease in an experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis mouse model of chronic progressive multiple sclerosis results in striking reversal of disease severity. Immune response assays show that miconazole functions directly as a remyelinating drug with no effect on the immune system, whereas clobetasol is a potent immunosuppressant as well as a remyelinating agent. Mechanistic studies show that miconazole and clobetasol function in oligodendrocyte progenitor cells through mitogen-activated protein kinase and glucocorticoid receptor signalling, respectively. Furthermore, both drugs enhance the generation of human oligodendrocytes from human oligodendrocyte progenitor cells in vitro. Collectively, our results provide a rationale for testing miconazole and clobetasol, or structurally modified derivatives, to enhance remyelination in patients.","[Najm, Fadi J.; Madhavan, Mayur; Shick, Elizabeth; Karl, Robert T.; Factor, Daniel C.; Miller, Tyler E.; Nevin, Zachary S.; Tesar, Paul J.] Case Western Reserve Univ, Sch Med, Dept Genet & Genome Sci, Cleveland, OH 44106 USA; [Zaremba, Anita; Kantor, Christopher; Sargent, Alex; Miller, Robert H.; Tesar, Paul J.] Case Western Reserve Univ, Sch Med, Dept Neurosci, Cleveland, OH 44106 USA; [Miller, Tyler E.] Case Western Reserve Univ, Sch Med, Dept Pathol, Cleveland, OH 44106 USA; [Miller, Tyler E.] Cleveland Clin, Dept Stem Cell Biol & Regenerat Med, Lerner Res Inst, Cleveland, OH 44195 USA; [Quick, Kevin L.] PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA 02451 USA; [Schlatzer, Daniela M.] Case Western Reserve Univ, Sch Med, Ctr Prote & Bioinformat, Cleveland, OH 44106 USA; [Tang, Hong; Papoian, Ruben] Univ Cincinnati, Coll Med, Ctr Drug Discovery, Cincinnati, OH 45237 USA; [Brimacombe, Kyle R.; Shen, Min; Boxer, Matthew B.; Jadhav, Ajit] NIH, Natl Ctr Adv Translat Sci, Rockville, MD 20852 USA; [Robinson, Andrew P.; Podojil, Joseph R.; Miller, Stephen D.] Northwestern Univ, Feinberg Sch Med, Dept Microbiol & Immunol, Chicago, IL 60611 USA; [Robinson, Andrew P.; Podojil, Joseph R.; Miller, Stephen D.] Northwestern Univ, Feinberg Sch Med, Interdept Immunobiol Ctr, Chicago, IL 60611 USA","Tesar, PJ (reprint author), Case Western Reserve Univ, Sch Med, Dept Genet & Genome Sci, Cleveland, OH 44106 USA.",rhm3@gwu.edu; paul.tesar@case.edu,,"Robinson, Andrew/0000-0002-1867-5634; Miller, Tyler E/0000-0002-1269-1895; Tesar, Paul/0000-0003-1532-3155","US NIH [NS085246, NS030800, NS026543]; NewYork Stem Cell Foundation; Myelin Repair Foundation; Mt.

The most recently acquired human ERV is HERVK(HML-2), which repeatedly infected the primate lineage both before and after the divergence of the human and chimpanzee common ancestor(2,3). Unlike most other human ERVs, HERVK retained multiple copies of intact open reading frames encoding retroviral proteins(4). However, HERVK is transcriptionally silenced by the host, with the exception of in certain pathological contexts such as germ-cell tumours, melanoma or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection(5-7). Here we demonstrate that DNA hypomethylation at long terminal repeat elements representing the most recent genomic integrations, together with transactivation by OCT4 (also known as POU5F1), synergistically facilitate HERVK expression. Consequently, HERVK is transcribed during normal human embryogenesis, beginning with embryonic genome activation at the eight-cell stage, continuing through the emergence of epiblast cells in preimplantation blastocysts, and ceasing during human embryonic stem cell derivation from blastocyst outgrowths. Remarkably, we detected HERVK viral-like particles and Gag proteins in human blastocysts, indicating that early human development proceeds in the presence of retroviral products. We further show that overexpression of one such product, the HERVK accessory protein Rec, in a pluripotent cell line is sufficient to increase IFITM1 levels on the cell surface and inhibit viral infection, suggesting at least one mechanism through which HERVK can induce viral restriction pathways in early embryonic cells. Moreover, Rec directly binds a subset of cellular RNAs and modulates their ribosome occupancy, indicating that complex interactions between retroviral proteins and host factors can fine-tune pathways of early human development.","[Grow, Edward J.; Wossidlo, Mark; Pera, Renee A.

Recent studies have implicated the epicardium in multiple aspects of cardiac repair: as a source of paracrine signals for cardiomyocyte survival or proliferation; a supply of perivascular cells and possibly other cell types such as cardiomyocytes; and as a mediator of inflammation1-9. However, the biology and dynamism of the adult epicardium is poorly understood. To investigate this, we created a transgenic line to ablate the epicardial cell population in adult zebrafish. Here we find that genetic depletion of the epicardium after myocardial loss inhibits cardiomyocyte proliferation and delays muscle regeneration. The epicardium vigorously regenerates after its ablation, through proliferation and migration of spared epicardial cells as a sheet to cover the exposed ventricular surface in a wave from the chamber base towards its apex. By reconstituting epicardial regeneration ex vivo, we show that extirpation of the bulbous arteriosus-a distinct, smooth-muscle-rich tissue structure that distributes outflow from the ventricle-prevents epicardial regeneration. Conversely, experimental repositioning of the bulbous arteriosus by tissue recombination initiates epicardial regeneration and can govern its direction. Hedgehog (Hh) ligand is expressed in the bulbous arteriosus, and treatment with a Hh signalling antagonist arrests epicardial regeneration and blunts the epicardial response to muscle injury. Transplantation of Sonic hedgehog (Shh)-soaked beads at the ventricular base stimulates epicardial regeneration after bulbous arteriosus removal, indicating that Hh signalling can substitute for the influence of the outflow tract. Thus, the ventricular epicardium has pronounced regenerative capacity, regulated by the neighbouring cardiac outflow tract and Hh signalling. These findings extend our understanding of tissue interactions during regeneration and have implications for mobilizing epicardial cells for therapeutic heart repair.","[Wang, Jinhu; Cao, Jingli; Dickson, Amy L.; Poss, Kenneth D.] Duke Univ, Med Ctr, Dept Cell Biol, Durham, NC 27710 USA; [Wang, Jinhu; Cao, Jingli; Dickson, Amy L.; Poss, Kenneth D.] Duke Univ, Med Ctr, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Durham, NC 27710 USA","Poss, KD (reprint author), Duke Univ, Med Ctr, Dept Cell Biol, Durham, NC 27710 USA.",kenneth.poss@duke.edu,,"Cao, Jingli/0000-0001-5938-6604; Poss, Kenneth/0000-0002-6743-5709",American Heart Association; National Institutes of Health [HL081674]; American Federation for Aging Research,"We thank J.

How the nuclear envelope is sealed, and how this is coordinated with spindle disassembly, is largely unknown. Here we show that endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT)-III, previously found to promote membrane constriction and sealing during receptor sorting, virus budding, cytokinesis and plasma membrane repair(3-6), is transiently recruited to the reassembling nuclear envelope during late anaphase. ESCRT-III and its regulatory AAA (ATPase associated with diverse cellular activities) ATPase VPS4 are specifically recruited by the ESCRT-III-like protein CHMP7 to sites where the reforming nuclear envelope engulfs spindle microtubules. Subsequent association of another ESCRT-III-like protein, IST1, directly recruits the AAA ATPase spastin to sever microtubules. Disrupting spastin function impairs spindle disassembly and results in extended localization of ESCRT-III at the nuclear envelope. Interference with ESCRT-III functions in anaphase is accompanied by delayed microtubule disassembly, compromised nuclear integrity and the appearance of DNA damage foci in subsequent interphase. We propose that ESCRT-III, VPS4 and spastin cooperate to coordinate nuclear envelope sealing and spindle disassembly at nuclear envelope-microtubule intersection sites during mitotic exit to ensure nuclear integrity and genome safeguarding, with a striking mechanistic parallel to cytokinetic abscission(7).","[Vietri, Marina; Schink, Kay O.; Campsteijn, Coen; Wegner, Catherine Sem; Schultz, Sebastian W.; Christ, Liliane; Thoresen, Sigrid B.; Brech, Andreas; Raiborg, Camilla; Stenmark, Harald] Univ Oslo, Fac Med, Ctr Canc Biomed, N-0379 Oslo, Norway; [Vietri, Marina; Schink, Kay O.; Campsteijn, Coen; Wegner, Catherine Sem; Schultz, Sebastian W.; Christ, Liliane; Thoresen, Sigrid B.; Brech, Andreas; Raiborg, Camilla; Stenmark, Harald] Oslo Univ Hosp, Inst Canc Res, Dept Mol Cell Biol, N-0379 Oslo, Norway; [Stenmark, Harald] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Fac Med, Ctr Mol Inflammat Res, N-7491 Trondheim, Norway","Campsteijn, C (reprint author), Univ Oslo, Fac Med, Ctr Canc Biomed, N-0379 Oslo, Norway.",coen.campsteijn@rr-research.no; stenmark@ulrik.uio.no,,"Schink, Kay Oliver/0000-0002-5903-4059",European Research Council; Research Council of Norway through Centres of Excellence [179571],"We thank T.

NE reformation requires the coating of chromatin by membrane derived from the endoplasmic reticulum, and a subsequent annular fusion step to ensure that the formed envelope is sealed(1,2,4,5). How annular fusion is accomplished is unknown, but it is thought to involve the p97 AAA-ATPase complex and bears a topological equivalence to the membrane fusion event that occurs during the abscission phase of cytokinesis(1,6). Herewe show that the endosomal sorting complex required for transport-III (ESCRT-III) machinery localizes to sites of annular fusion in the forming NE in human cells, and is necessary for proper post-mitotic nucleocytoplasmic compartmentalization. The ESCRT-III component charged multivesicular body protein 2A (CHMP2A) is directed to the forming NE through binding to CHMP4B, and provides an activity essential for NE reformation. Localization also requires the p97 complex member ubiquitin fusion and degradation 1 (UFD1). Our results describe a novel role for the ESCRT machinery in cell division and demonstrate a conservation of themachineries involved in topologically equivalent mitotic membrane remodelling events.","[Olmos, Yolanda; Carlton, Jeremy G.] Kings Coll London, Sect Cell Biol & Imaging, Div Canc Studies, London SE1 1UL, England; [Hodgson, Lorna; Mantell, Judith; Verkade, Paul] Univ Bristol, Sch Biochem, Bristol BS8 1TD, Avon, England; [Mantell, Judith; Verkade, Paul] Univ Bristol, Wolfson Bioimaging Facil, Bristol BS8 1TD, Avon, England; [Verkade, Paul] Univ Bristol, Sch Physiol & Pharmacol, Bristol BS8 1TD, Avon, England","Carlton, JG (reprint author), Kings Coll London, Sect Cell Biol & Imaging, Div Canc Studies, London SE1 1UL, England.",jeremy.carlton@kcl.ac.uk,,"Verkade, Paul/0000-0002-2497-1026","Wellcome Trust [, 093603]",,,32,77,78,7,27,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,11-Jun,2015,522,7555,,,,,236,+,,10.1038/nature14503,,21,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,CK2CI,WOS:000356016700043,26040713,No,Y,N,11/19/17

They have an active role in genetic variation, adaptation and evolution through the duplication or deletion of genes or their regulatory elements(2-4), and transposable elements themselves can act as alternative promoters for nearby genes, resulting in noncanonical regulation of transcription(5,6). However, transposable element activity can lead to detrimental genome instability(7), and hosts have evolved mechanisms to silence transposable element mobility appropriately(8,9). Recent studies have demonstrated that a subset of transposable elements, endogenous retroviral elements (ERVs) containing long terminal repeats (LTRs), are silenced through trimethylation of histone H3 on lysine 9 (H3K9me3) by ESET (also known as SETDB1 or KMT1E)(10) and a co-repressor complex containing KRAB-associated protein 1 (KAP1; also known as TRIM28)(11) in mouse embryonic stem cells. Here we show that the replacement histone variant H3.3 is enriched at class I and class II ERVs, notably those of the early transposon (ETn)/MusD family and intracisternal A-type particles (IAPs). Deposition at a subset of these elements is dependent upon the H3.3 chaperone complex containing alpha-thalassaemia/mental retardation syndrome X-linked (ATRX) 12 and death-domain-associated protein (DAXX)(12-14). We demonstrate that recruitment of DAXX, H3.3 and KAP1 to ERVs is co-dependent and occurs upstream of ESET, linking H3.3 to ERV-associated H3K9me3. Importantly, H3K9me3 is reduced at ERVs upon H3.3 deletion, resulting in derepression and dysregulation of adjacent, endogenous genes, along with increased retrotransposition of IAPs. Our study identifies a unique heterochromatin state marked by the presence of both H3.3 and H3K9me3, and establishes an important role for H3.3 in control of ERV retrotransposition in embryonic stem cells.","[Elsasser, Simon J.] MRC Lab Mol Biol, Cambridge CB2 0QH, England; [Elsasser, Simon J.] Karolinska Inst, Dept Med Biochem & Biophys, Div Translat Med & Chem Biol, Sci Life Lab, S-17121 Stockholm, Sweden; [Noh, Kyung-Min; Diaz, Nichole; Allis, C.

Perturbations by the other bodies, however, inject chaos into this otherwise stable configuration. Nix and Hydra have bright surfaces similar to that of Charon.

The activity of hippocampal neurons appears to reflect such a relationship, representing not only instantaneous position but also the path towards a goal location. However, how the hippocampus obtains information about goal direction is poorly understood. Here we report a prefrontal-thalamic neural circuit that is required for hippocampal representation of routes or trajectories through the environment. Trajectory-dependent firing was observed in medial prefrontal cortex, the nucleus reuniens of the thalamus, and the CA1 region of the hippocampus in rats. Lesioning or optogenetic silencing of the nucleus reuniens substantially reduced trajectory-dependent CA1 firing. Trajectory-dependent activity was almost absent in CA3, which does not receive nucleus reuniens input. The data suggest that projections from medial prefrontal cortex, via the nucleus reuniens, are crucial for representation of the future path during goal-directed behaviour and point to the thalamus as a key node in networks for long-range communication between cortical regions involved in navigation.","[Ito, Hiroshi T.; Zhang, Sheng-Jia; Witter, Menno P.; Moser, Edvard I.; Moser, May-Britt] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, MTFS, Kavli Inst Syst Neurosci, N-7491 Trondheim, Norway; [Ito, Hiroshi T.; Zhang, Sheng-Jia; Witter, Menno P.; Moser, Edvard I.; Moser, May-Britt] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, MTFS, Ctr Neural Computat, N-7491 Trondheim, Norway","Ito, HT (reprint author), Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, MTFS, Kavli Inst Syst Neurosci, Olav Kyrres Gate 9, N-7491 Trondheim, Norway.",hiroshi.ito@ntnu.no; may-britt.moser@ntnu.no,,,"European Research Council [232608, 268598]; Kavli Foundation; Centre of Excellence scheme of the Research Council of Norway (Centre for the Biology of Memory); Centre of Excellence scheme of the Research Council of Norway (Centre for Neural Computation)","We thank A.M.

Multipotent progenitors undergo cell-fate restriction in response to cues from the microenvironment, the nature of which is poorly understood. In the case of the lymphatic system, venous cells from the cardinal vein are thought to generate lymphatic vessels through trans-differentiation. Here we show that in zebrafish, lymphatic progenitors arise from a previously uncharacterized niche of specialized angioblasts within the cardinal vein, which also generates arterial and venous fates. We further identify Wnt5b as a novel lymphatic inductive signal and show that it also promotes the 'angioblast-to-lymphatic' transition in human embryonic stem cells, suggesting that this process is evolutionarily conserved. Our results uncover a novel mechanism of lymphatic specification, and provide the first characterization of the lymphatic inductive niche.

These drainage events drive transient ice-sheet acceleration(1-3) and establish conduits for additional surface-to-bed meltwater transport for the remainder of the melt season(1,4-6). Although it is well established that cracks must remain water-filled to propagate to the bed(7-9), the precise mechanisms that initiate hydro-fracture events beneath lakes are unknown. Here we show that, for a lake on the western Greenland Ice Sheet, drainage events are preceded by a 6-12 hour period of ice-sheet uplift and/or enhanced basal slip. Our observations from a dense Global Positioning System (GPS) network allow us to determine the distribution of meltwater at the ice-sheet bed before, during, and after three rapid drainages in 2011-2013, each of which generates tensile stresses that promote hydro-fracture beneath the lake. We hypothesize that these precursors are associated with the introduction of meltwater to the bed through neighbouring moulin systems (vertical conduits connecting the surface and base of the ice sheet). Our results imply that as lakes form in less crevassed, interior regions of the ice sheet(10-14), where water at the bed is currently less pervasive(5,14-16), the creation of new surface-to-bed conduits caused by lake-draining hydro-fractures may be limited.","[Stevens, Laura A.] MIT, Woods Hole Oceanog Inst, Joint Program Oceanog Appl Ocean Sci & Engn, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA; [Behn, Mark D.; McGuire, Jeffrey J.; Das, Sarah B.] Woods Hole Oceanog Inst, Dept Geol & Geophys, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA; [Joughin, Ian; Shean, David E.] Univ Washington, Polar Sci Ctr, Appl Phys Lab, Seattle, WA 98105 USA; [Herring, Thomas] MIT, Dept Earth Atmospher & Planetary Sci, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [King, Matt A.] Univ Tasmania, Sch Land & Food, Hobart, Tas 7001, Australia; [King, Matt A.] Newcastle Univ, Sch Civil Engn & Geosci, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 7RU, Tyne & Wear, England","Stevens, LA (reprint author), 360 Woods Hole Rd, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA.",stevensl@mit.edu,"Joughin, Ian/A-2998-2008; Behn, Mark/F-5813-2012; King, Matt/B-4622-2008","Joughin, Ian/0000-0001-6229-679X; Behn, Mark/0000-0002-2001-1335; King, Matt/0000-0001-5611-9498; /0000-0003-0480-8018; Shean, David/0000-0003-3840-3860; Herring, Thomas/0000-0002-6030-0545","National Science Foundation's Office of Polar Programs (NSF-OPP); National Aeronautics and Space Administration's (NASA's) Cryospheric Sciences Program [ARC-0520077, ARC-1023364, NNX10AI30G, ARC-0520382, ARC-1023382, NNX10AI33G]; Australian Research Council [FT110100207]; NSF [ANT-1043681]; National Science Foundation","Support was provided by the National Science Foundation's Office of Polar Programs (NSF-OPP) and National Aeronautics and Space Administration's (NASA's) Cryospheric Sciences Program through ARC-0520077, ARC-1023364, and NNX10AI30G to S.B.D. and M.D.B., and through ARC-0520382, ARC-1023382, and NNX10AI33G to I.J.

J,"Van Roy, P; Daley, AC; Briggs, DEG",,,,"Van Roy, Peter; Daley, Allison C.; Briggs, Derek E. G.",,,Anomalocaridid trunk limb homology revealed by a giant filter-feeder with paired flaps,NATURE,,,English,Article,,,,,,,BURGESS SHALE; ARTHROPOD; APPENDAGES; EVOLUTION; MORPHOLOGY; OPABINIA; PREDATORS; GREENLAND; AFFINITY; BRAIN,"Exceptionally preserved fossils from the Palaeozoic era provide crucial insights into arthropod evolution, with recent discoveries bringing phylogeny and character homology into sharp focus(1-4). Integral to such studies are anomalocaridids, a clade of stem arthropods whose remarkable morphology illuminates early arthropod relationships(5,6) and Cambrian ecology(7-9). Although recent work has focused on the anomalocaridid head(6-10), the nature of their trunk has been debated widely(5,11-18). Here we describe new anomalocaridid(17) specimens from the Early Ordovician Fezouata Biota of Morocco(19), which not only show well-preserved head appendages providing key ecological data, but also elucidate the nature of anomalocaridid trunk flaps, resolving their homology with arthropod trunk limbs. The new material shows that each trunk segment bears a separate dorsal and ventral pair of flaps, with a series of setal blades attached at the base of the dorsal flaps. Comparisons with other stem lineage arthropods(16,20-22) indicate that anomalocaridid ventral flaps are homologous with lobopodous walking limbs and the endopod of the euarthropod biramous limb, whereas the dorsal flaps and associated setal blades are homologous with the flaps of gilled lobopodians (for example, Kerygmachela kierkegaardi, Pambdelurion whittingtoni) and exites of the 'Cambrian biramous limb'(23). This evidence shows that anomalocaridids represent a stage before the fusion of exite and endopod into the 'Cambrian biramous limb'(5,16,23), confirming their basal placement in the euarthropod stem(4-6), rather than in the arthropod crown(24) or with cycloneuralian worms(14). Unlike other anomalocaridids, the Fezouata taxon combines head appendages convergently(9) adapted for filter-feeding with an unprecedented body length exceeding 2 m, indicating a new direction in the feeding ecology of the clade. The evolution of giant filter-feeding anomalocaridids may reflect the establishment of highly developed planktic ecosystems during the Great Ordovician Biodiversification Event(25).","[Van Roy, Peter; Briggs, Derek E.

To Charles Darwin(1,)2, who first collected their remains, they included perhaps the 'strangest animal[s] ever discovered'. Today, much like 180 years ago, it is no clearer whether they had one origin or several, arose before or after the Cretaceous/Palaeogene transition 66.2 million years ago(3), or are more likely to belong with the elephants and sirenians of superorder Afrotheria than with the euungulates (cattle, horses, and allies) of superorder Laurasiatheria(4-6). Morphology-based analyses have proved unconvincing because convergences are pervasive among unrelated ungulate-like placentals. Approaches using ancient DNA have also been unsuccessful, probably because of rapid DNA degradation in semitropical and temperate deposits. Here we apply proteomic analysis to screen bone samples of the Late Quaternary South American native ungulate taxa Toxodon (Notoungulata) and Macrauchenia (Litopterna) for phylogenetically informative protein sequences. For each ungulate, we obtain approximately 90% direct sequence coverage of type I collagen alpha 1-and alpha 2-chains, representing approximately 900 of 1,140 amino-acid residues for each subunit. A phylogeny is estimated from an alignment of these fossil sequences with collagen (I) gene transcripts from available mammalian genomes or mass spectrometrically derived sequence data obtained for this study. The resulting consensus tree agrees well with recent higher-level mammalian phylogenies(7-9). Toxodon and Macrauchenia form a monophyletic group whose sister taxon is not Afrotheria or any of its constituent clades as recently claimed(5,6), but instead crown Perissodactyla (horses, tapirs, and rhinoceroses). These results are consistent with the origin of at least some South American native ungulates(4,6) from 'condylarths', a paraphyletic assembly of archaic placentals. With ongoing improvements in instrumentation and analytical procedures, proteomics may produce a revolution in systematics such as that achieved by genomics, but with the possibility of reaching much further back in time.","[Welker, Frido; Collins, Matthew J.; Thomas, Jessica A.; Wadsley, Marc; Rowsell, Keri; Hofreiter, Michael] Univ York, BioArCh, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England; [Welker, Frido; Hublin, Jean-Jacques] Max Planck Inst Evolutionary Anthropol, Dept Human Evolut, D-04103 Leipzig, Germany; [Brace, Selina; Barnes, Ian] Nat Hist Museum, Dept Earth Sci, London SW7 5BD, England; [Cappellini, Enrico; Willerslev, Eske; Orlando, Ludovic] Univ Copenhagen, Nat Hist Museum Denmark, Ctr GeoGenet, DK-1350 Copenhagen K, Denmark; [Turvey, Samuel T.] Zool Soc London, Inst Zool, London NW1 4RY, England; [Reguero, Marcelo; Gelfo, Javier N.] Univ Nacl La Plata, Fac Ciencias Nat & Museo La Plata, CONICET, Div Paleontol Vertebrados,Museo La Plata, RA-1900 La Plata, Buenos Aires, Argentina; [Kramarz, Alejandro] Museo Argentino Ciencias Nat Bernardino Rivadavia, Secc Paleontol Vertebrados, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Burger, Joachim] Johannes Gutenberg Univ Mainz, Inst Anthropol, D-55128 Mainz, Germany; [Thomas-Oates, Jane] Univ York, Dept Chem, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England; [Ashford, David A.; Ashton, Peter D.] Univ York, Dept Biol, Biosci Technol Facil, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England; [Porter, Duncan M.] Virginia Polytech Inst & State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA; [Kessler, Benedikt; Fischer, Roman] Univ Oxford, Target Discovery Inst, Nuffield Dept Med, Oxford OX3 7FZ, England; [Baessmann, Carsten; Kaspar, Stephanie] Bruker Daltonik GmbH, Applicat Dev, D-28359 Bremen, Germany; [Olsen, Jesper V.; Kelstrup, Christian D.] Univ Copenhagen, Fac Hlth Sci, Novo Nordisk Fdn Ctr Prot Res, DK-2200 Copenhagen, Denmark; [Kiley, Patrick; Elliott, James A.] Univ Cambridge, Dept Mat Sci & Met, Cambridge CB3 0FS, England; [Mullin, Victoria] Trinity Coll Dublin, Smurfit Inst Genet, Dublin 2, Ireland; [Hofreiter, Michael] Inst Biochem & Biol, D-14476 Potsdam Ot Golm, Germany; [MacPhee, Ross D.

However, the chronology of the site remains controversial(8-14) owing to the complex history of cave infilling. Much of the existing chronology based on uranium-lead dating(10,11) and palaeomagnetic stratigraphy(8,12) has recently been called into question by the recognition that dated flowstones fill cavities formed within previously cemented breccias and therefore do not form a stratigraphic sequence(4,14). Earlier dating with cosmogenic nuclides(9) suffered a high degree of uncertainty and has been questioned on grounds of sediment reworking(10,11,13). Here we use isochron burial dating with cosmogenic aluminium-26 and beryllium-10 to show that the breccia containing StW 573 did not undergo significant reworking, and that it was deposited 3.67 +/- 0.16 million years ago, far earlier than the 2.2 million year flowstones found within it(10,11). The skeleton is thus coeval with early Australopithecus afar-ensis in eastern Africa(15,16). We also date the earliest stone tools at Sterkfontein to 2.18 +/- 0.21 million years ago, placing them in the Oldowan at a time similar to that found elsewhere in South Africa at Swartkans(17) and Wonderwerk(18).","[Granger, Darryl E.; Caffee, Marc W.] Purdue Univ, Dept Earth Atmospher & Planetary Sci, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA; [Gibbon, Ryan J.] Univ New Brunswick, Dept Anthropol, Fredericton, NB E3B 5A3, Canada; [Kuman, Kathleen; Clarke, Ronald J.] Univ Witwatersrand, Evolutionary Studies Inst, ZA-2050 Johannesburg, South Africa; [Kuman, Kathleen; Bruxelles, Laurent] Univ Witwatersrand, Sch Geog Archaeol & Environm Studies, ZA-2050 Johannesburg, South Africa; [Bruxelles, Laurent] French Natl Inst Prevent Archaeol Res Inrap, F-30900 Nimes, France; [Bruxelles, Laurent] Univ Toulouse Jean Jaures, UMR 5608, CNRS, TRACES,Maison Rech, F-31058 Toulouse, France; [Caffee, Marc W.] Purdue Univ, Dept Phys & Astron, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA","Granger, DE (reprint author), Purdue Univ, Dept Earth Atmospher & Planetary Sci, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA.",dgranger@purdue.edu,"Caffee, Marc/K-7025-2015","Caffee, Marc/0000-0002-6846-8967; Kuman, Kathleen/0000-0003-1252-9895","National Science Foundation [EAR1153689, EAR0844151]; Palaeontological Scientific Trust (PAST); National Research Foundation (NRF) of South Africa; NRF (SA) [AOP1207112551-82611, AOP1207173196-82591]","This work results from a collaboration begun with T.

MECP2 encodes a methyl-DNA-binding protein(2) that has been proposed to function as a transcriptional repressor, but despite numerous mouse studies examining neuronal gene expression in Mecp2 mutants, no clear model has emerged for how MeCP2 protein regulates transcription(3-9). Here we identify a genome-wide length-dependent increase in gene expression in MeCP2 mutant mouse models and human RTT brains. We present evidence that MeCP2 represses gene expression by binding to methylated CA sites within long genes, and that in neurons lacking MeCP2, decreasing the expression of long genes attenuates RTT-associated cellular deficits. In addition, we find that long genes as a population are enriched for neuronal functions and selectively expressed in the brain. These findings suggest that mutations in MeCP2 may cause neurological dysfunction by specifically disrupting long gene expression in the brain.","[Gabel, Harrison W.; Kinde, Benyam; Stroud, Hume; Gilbert, Caitlin S.; Harmin, David A.; Kastan, Nathaniel R.; Ebert, Daniel H.; Greenberg, Michael E.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Neurobiol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Hemberg, Martin] Harvard Univ, Ctr Brain Sci, Childrens Hosp Boston, Dept Ophthalmol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Hemberg, Martin] Harvard Univ, Swartz Ctr Theoret Neurosci, Boston, MA 02115 USA","Greenberg, ME (reprint author), Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Neurobiol, Boston, MA 02115 USA.",michael_greenberg@hms.harvard.edu,,,Rett Syndrome Research Trust; National Institutes of Health (NIH) [1RO1NS048276]; Damon Runyon Cancer Research Foundation [DRG-2048-10]; William Randolf Hearst fund; NIH [T32GM007753]; HHMI,"We thank E.

In contrast to tissue growth, the cells and molecular signals required for tissue regression remain unknown. To investigate physiological tissue regression, we use the mouse hair follicle, which cycles stereotypically between phases of growth and regression while maintaining a pool of stem cells to perpetuate tissue regeneration(3). Here we show by intravital microscopy in live mice(4-6) that the regression phase eliminates the majority of the epithelial cells by two distinct mechanisms: terminal differentiation of suprabasal cells and a spatial gradient of apoptosis of basal cells. Furthermore, we demonstrate that basal epithelial cells collectively act as phagocytes to clear dying epithelial neighbours. Through cellular and genetic ablation we show that epithelial cell death is extrinsically induced through transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta activation and mesenchymal crosstalk. Strikingly, our data show that regression acts to reduce the stem cell pool, as inhibition of regression results in excess basal epithelial cells with regenerative abilities. This study identifies the cellular behaviours and molecular mechanisms of regression that counterbalance growth to maintain tissue homeostasis.","[Mesa, Kailin R.; Rompolas, Panteleimon; Myung, Peggy; Sun, Thomas Y.; Brown, Samara; Greco, Valentina] Yale Univ, Sch Med, Dept Genet, New Haven, CT 06510 USA; [Zito, Giovanni] Univ Palermo, Dept Biopathol & Med Biotechnol, I-90100 Palermo, Italy; [Myung, Peggy; Greco, Valentina] Yale Univ, Sch Med, Dept Dermatol, New Haven, CT 06510 USA; [Gonzalez, David G.; Haberman, Ann M.] Yale Univ, Sch Med, Dept Immunobiol, Dept Lab Med, New Haven, CT 06510 USA; [Blagoev, Krastan B.] Natl Sci Fdn, Arlington, VA 22230 USA; [Blagoev, Krastan B.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Massachusetts Gen Hosp, AA Martinos Ctr Biomed Imaging,Dept Radiol, Boston, MA 02114 USA; [Greco, Valentina] Yale Univ, Sch Med, Yale Stem Cell Ctr, New Haven, CT 06510 USA; [Greco, Valentina] Yale Univ, Sch Med, Yale Canc Ctr, New Haven, CT 06510 USA","Greco, V (reprint author), Yale Univ, Sch Med, Dept Genet, New Haven, CT 06510 USA.",valentina.greco@yale.edu,"Zito, Giovanni/J-7238-2016","Zito, Giovanni/0000-0002-0482-6729; Mesa, Kailin/0000-0003-4452-9048","National Institutes of Health (NIH) [5T32 GM007223]; American Cancer Society [RSG-12-059-02]; National Cancer Institute, NIH [2P50CA121974]; National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases (NIAMS), NIH [1R01AR063663-01]; New York Stem Cell Foundation; NIAMS Rheumatic Diseases Research Core Centers [5 P30 AR053495-07]; NSF","We thank E.

In marine ecosystems, these interactions are difficult to study partly because the major photosynthetic organisms are microscopic, unicellular phytoplankton(3). Coastal phytoplankton communities are dominated by diatoms, which generate approximately 40% of marine primary production and form the base of many marine food webs(4). Diatoms co-occur with specific bacterial taxa(3), but the mechanisms of potential interactions are mostly unknown. Here we tease apart a bacterial consortium associated with a globally distributed diatom and find that a Sulfitobacter species promotes diatom cell division via secretion of the hormone indole-3-acetic acid, synthesized by the bacterium using both diatom-secreted and endogenous tryptophan. Indole-3-acetic acid and tryptophan serve as signalling molecules that are part of a complex exchange of nutrients, including diatom-excreted organosulfur molecules and bacterial-excreted ammonia. The potential prevalence of this mode of signalling in the oceans is corroborated by metabolite and metatranscriptome analyses that show widespread indole-3-acetic acid production by Sulfitobacter-related bacteria, particularly in coastal environments. Our study expands on the emerging recognition that marine microbial communities are part of tightly connected networks by providing evidence that these interactions are mediated through production and exchange of infochemicals.","[Amin, S.

Although the first outbreak wave that was centred on eastern China was seemingly averted, human infections recurred in October 2013 (refs 3-7). It is unclear how the H7N9 virus re-emerged and how it will develop further; potentially it may become a long-term threat to public health. Here we show that H7N9 viruses have spread from eastern to southern China and become persistent in chickens, which has led to the establishment of multiple regionally distinct lineages with different reassortant genotypes. Repeated introductions of viruses from Zhejiang to other provinces and the presence of H7N9 viruses at live poultry markets have fuelled the recurrence of human infections. This rapid expansion of the geographical distribution and genetic diversity of the H7N9 viruses poses a direct challenge to current disease control systems. Our results also suggest that H7N9 viruses have become enzootic in China and may spread beyond the region, following the pattern previously observed with H5N1 and H9N2 influenza viruses(8,9).","[Lam, Tommy Tsan-Yuk; Zhou, Boping; Chen, Xinchun; Duan, Lian; Chen, Peiwen; Jiang, Junfei; Poon, Leo Lit Man; Peiris, Joseph S.

Tumour-secreted proteins play a crucial role in these interactions(2-5) and present strategic therapeutic potential. Metastasis of breast cancer to the bone affects approximately 85% of patients with advanced disease and renders them largely untreatable(6). Specifically, osteolytic bone lesions, where bone is destroyed, lead to debilitating skeletal complications and increased patient morbidity and mortality(6,7). The molecular interactions governing the early events of osteolytic lesion formation are currently unclear. Here we show hypoxia to be specifically associated with bone relapse in patients with oestrogen-receptor negative breast cancer. Global quantitative analysis of the hypoxic secretome identified lysyl oxidase (LOX) as significantly associated with bone-tropism and relapse. High expression of LOX in primary breast tumours or systemic delivery of LOX leads to osteolytic lesion formation whereas silencing or inhibition of LOX activity abrogates tumour-driven osteolytic lesion formation. We identify LOX as a novel regulator of NFATc1-driven osteoclastogenesis, independent of RANK ligand, which disrupts normal bone homeostasis leading to the formation of focal pre-metastatic lesions. We show that these lesions subsequently provide a platform for circulating tumour cells to colonize and form bone metastases. Our study identifies a novel mechanism of regulation of bone homeostasis and metastasis, opening up opportunities for novel therapeutic intervention with important clinical implications.","[Cox, Thomas R.; Perryman, Lara; Hoye, Anette M.; Linding, Rune; Erler, Janine T.] Univ Copenhagen UCPH, Biotech Res & Innovat Ctr BRIC, DK-2200 Copenhagen, Denmark; [Cox, Thomas R.; Bird, Demelza; Lang, Georgina; Erler, Janine T.] Inst Canc Res, Hypoxia & Metastasis Team, Canc Res UK Tumour Cell Signalling Unit, London SW3 6JB, England; [Rumney, Robin M.

The 13-subunit, 800-kilodalton eukaryotic initiation factor 3 (eIF3) organizes initiation factor and ribosome interactions required for productive translation(3). However, current understanding of eIF3 function does not explain genetic evidence correlating eIF3 deregulation with tissue-specific cancers and developmental defects(4). Here we report the genome-wide discovery of human transcripts that interact with eIF3 using photoactivatable ribonucleoside-enhanced cross-linking and immunoprecipitation (PAR-CLIP)(5). eIF3 binds to a highly specific program of messenger RNAs involved in cell growth control processes, including cell cycling, differentiation and apoptosis, via them RNA 5' untranslated region. Surprisingly, functional analysis of the interaction between eIF3 and two mRNAs encoding the cell proliferation regulators c-JUN and BTG1 reveals that eIF3 uses different modes of RNA stem-loop binding to exert either translational activation or repression. Our findings illuminate a new role for eIF3 in governing a specialized repertoire of gene expression and suggest that binding of eIF3 to specific mRNAs could be targeted to control carcinogenesis.","[Lee, Amy S.

A popular but unconfirmed hypothesis to explain how the plasma is energized is the 'internal shock model', in which the relativistic flow is unsteady(2). Faster components in the jet catch up to and collide with slower ones, leading to internal shocks that accelerate particles and generate magnetic fields(3). This mechanism can explain the variable, high-energy emission from a diverse set of objects(4-7), with the best indirect evidence being the unseen fast relativistic flow inferred to energize slower components in X-ray binary jets(8,9). Mapping of the kinematic profiles in resolved jets has revealed precessing and helical patterns in X-ray binaries(10,11), apparent superluminal motions(12,13), and the ejection of knots (bright components) from standing shocks in the jets of active galaxies(14,15). Observations revealing the structure and evolution of an internal shock in action have, however, remained elusive, hindering measurement of the physical parameters and ultimate efficiency of the mechanism. Here we report observations of a collision between two knots in the jet of nearby radio galaxy 3C 264. Abright knot with an apparent speed of (7.0 +/- 0.8)c, where c is the speed of light in a vacuum, is in the incipient stages of a collision with a slower-moving knot of speed (1.8 +/- 0.5)c just downstream, resulting in brightening of both knots-as seen in the most recent epoch of imaging.","[Meyer, Eileen T.; Sparks, William B.; van der Marel, Roeland P.; Anderson, Jay; Biretta, John; Norman, Colin; Chiaberge, Marco] Space Telescope Sci Inst, 3700 San Martin Dr, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA; [Meyer, Eileen T.; Georganopoulos, Markos] Univ Maryland Baltimore Cty, Baltimore, MD 21250 USA; [Georganopoulos, Markos] NASA, Goddard Space Flight Ctr, Greenbelt, MD 20771 USA; [Perlman, Eric] Florida Inst Technol, Melbourne, FL 32901 USA; [Sohn, Sangmo Tony; Norman, Colin; Chiaberge, Marco] Johns Hopkins Univ, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA; [Chiaberge, Marco] Ist Radio Astron, Ist Nazl Astrofis, I-40129 Bologna, Italy","Meyer, ET (reprint author), Space Telescope Sci Inst, 3700 San Martin Dr, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA.",eileen.meyer@gmail.com,,"van der Marel, Roeland/0000-0001-7827-7825; Norman, Colin/0000-0002-5222-5717",HST [GO-13327],E.T.M. acknowledges HST grant GO-13327.,,28,6,6,2,5,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,28-May,2015,521,7553,,,,,495,+,,10.1038/nature14481,,13,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,DF8BN,WOS:000371582000002,26017450,No,,,11/19/17

Further analyses continue to support the proposal that several hominin species co-existed during this time period. Here we recognize a new hominin species (Australopithecus deyiremeda sp. nov.) from 3.3-3.5-million-year-old deposits in the Woranso-Mille study area, central Afar, Ethiopia. The new species from Woranso-Mille shows that there were at least two contemporaneous hominin species living in the Afar region of Ethiopia between 3.3 and 3.5 million years ago, and further confirms early hominin taxonomic diversity in eastern Africa during the Middle Pliocene epoch. The morphology of Au. deyiremeda also reinforces concerns related to dentognathic (that is, jaws and teeth) homoplasy in Plio-Pleistocene hominins, and shows that some dentognathic features traditionally associated with Paranthropus and Homo appeared in the fossil record earlier than previously thought.","[Haile-Selassie, Yohannes] Cleveland Museum Nat Hist, Cleveland, OH 44106 USA; [Haile-Selassie, Yohannes; Saylor, Beverly Z.] Case Western Reserve Univ, Cleveland, OH 44106 USA; [Gibert, Luis] Univ Barcelona, E-08028 Barcelona, Spain; [Melillo, Stephanie M.] Max Planck Inst Evolutionare Anthropol, D-04103 Leipzig, Germany; [Ryan, Timothy M.] Penn State Univ, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Alene, Mulugeta] Univ Addis Ababa, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia; [Deino, Alan; Scott, Gary] Berkeley Geochronol Ctr, Berkeley, CA 94709 USA; [Levin, Naomi E.] Johns Hopkins Univ, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA","Haile-Selassie, Y (reprint author), Cleveland Museum Nat Hist, Cleveland, OH 44106 USA.",yhailese@cmnh.org,"Levin, Naomi/B-4124-2010","Levin, Naomi/0000-0001-5703-3717; Saylor, Beverly/0000-0002-1825-8953","LSB Leakey Foundation; National Geographic Society; Cleveland Museum of Natural History; National Science Foundation [BCS-0234320, BCS-0321893, BCS-0542037, BCS-1124705, BCS-1124713, BCS-1124716, BCS-1125157, BCS-1125345]","We thank the Authority for Research and Conservation of Cultural Heritage and the Afar Regional State of Ethiopia for permission to conduct field and laboratory research, the Afar people of the Woranso-Mille area for their hospitality, and the project's fieldwork crew members for their incredible contributions in our fieldwork endeavours.

To understand the drivers of clinical phenotypes better, here we use whole-genome sequencing of tumour and germline DNA samples from 92 patients with primary refractory, resistant, sensitive and matched acquired resistant disease. We show that gene breakage commonly inactivates the tumour suppressors RB1, NF1, RAD51B and PTEN in HGSC, and contributes to acquired chemotherapy resistance. CCNE1 amplification was common in primary resistant and refractory disease. We observed several molecular events associated with acquired resistance, including multiple independent reversions of germline BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations in individual patients, loss of BRCA1 promoter methylation, an alteration in molecular subtype, and recurrent promoter fusion associated with overexpression of the drug efflux pump MDR1.","[Patch, Ann-Marie; Nones, Katia; Bailey, Peter J.; Kassahn, Karin S.; Newell, Felicity; Quinn, Michael C.

The advancement of these spectroscopy techniques to study strong-field electron dynamics in condensed matter calls for the generation and manipulation of EUV radiation in bulk solids, but this capability has remained beyond the reach of optical sciences. Recent experiments(8,9) and theoretical predictions(10-12) paved the way to strong-field physics in solids by demonstrating the generation and optical control of deep ultraviolet radiation(8) in bulk semiconductors, driven by femtosecond mid-infrared fields or the coherent up-conversion of terahertz fields to multi-octave spectra in the mid-infrared and optical frequencies(9). Here we demonstrate that thin films of SiO2 exposed to intense, few-cycle to sub-cycle pulses give rise to wideband coherent EUV radiation extending in energy to about 40 electronvolts. Our study indicates the association of the emitted EUV radiation with intraband currents of multi-petahertz frequency, induced in the lowest conduction band of SiO2. To demonstrate the applicability of high-harmonic spectroscopy to solids, we exploit the EUV spectra to gain access to fine details of the energy dispersion profile of the conduction band that are as yet inaccessible by photoemission spectroscopy in wide-bandgap dielectrics. In addition, we use the EUV spectra to trace the attosecond control of the intraband electron motion induced by synthesized optical transients. Our work advances light-wave electronics(5,13-15) in condensed matter into the realm of multi-petahertz frequencies and their attosecond control, and marks the advent of solid-state EUV photonics.","[Luu, T.
