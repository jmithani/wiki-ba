Genome-wide nucleosome assembly on paternal DNA implies the replacement of sperm chromosomal proteins, such as protamines, by maternally provided histones(1,2). This fundamental process is specifically impaired in sesame (ssm), a unique Drosophila maternal effect mutant that prevents male pronucleus formation(3). Here we show that ssm is a point mutation in the Hira gene, thus demonstrating that the histone chaperone protein HIRA is required for nucleosome assembly during sperm nucleus decondensation. In vertebrates, HIRA has recently been shown to be critical for a nucleosome assembly pathway independent of DNA synthesis that specifically involves the H3.3 histone variant(4,5). We also show that nucleosomes containing H3.3, and not H3, are specifically assembled in paternal Drosophila chromatin before the first round of DNA replication. The exclusive marking of paternal chromosomes with H3.3 represents a primary epigenetic distinction between parental genomes in the zygote, and underlines an important consequence of the critical and highly specialized function of HIRA at fertilization.","Univ Lyon 1, CNRS, UMR 5534, Ctr Genet Mol & Cellulaire, F-69622 Villeurbanne, France; Inst Natl Sci Appl, INRA, UMR, F-69621 Villeurbanne, France; Univ Bath, Dept Biol & Biochem, Bath BA2 7AY, Avon, England","Loppin, B (reprint author), Univ Lyon 1, CNRS, UMR 5534, Ctr Genet Mol & Cellulaire, F-69622 Villeurbanne, France.",loppin@cgmc.univ-lyon1.fr,"Karr, Timothy/G-1693-2011",,,,,29,198,212,0,5,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,27-Oct,2005,437,7063,,,,,1386,1390,,10.1038/nature04059,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,977UQ,WOS:000232829100060,16251970,No,,,11/20/17

Glucagon enhances glucose output from the liver during fasting by stimulating the transcription of gluconeogenic genes via the cyclic AMP-inducible factor CREB (CRE binding protein). When cellular ATP levels are low, however, the energy-sensing kinase AMPK inhibits hepatic gluconeogenesis through an unknown mechanism. Here we show that hormonal and energy-sensing pathways converge on the coactivator TORC2 (transducer of regulated CREB activity 2) to modulate glucose output. Sequestered in the cytoplasm under feeding conditions, TORC2 is dephosphorylated and transported to the nucleus where it enhances CREB-dependent transcription in response to fasting stimuli. Conversely, signals that activate AMPK attenuate the gluconeogenic programme by promoting TORC2 phosphorylation and blocking its nuclear accumulation. Individuals with type 2 diabetes often exhibit fasting hyperglycaemia due to elevated gluconeogenesis; compounds that enhance TORC2 phosphorylation may offer therapeutic benefits in this setting.","Salk Inst Biol Studies, Peptide Biol Labs, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; St Jude Childrens Res Hosp, Dept Biochem, Memphis, TN 38105 USA; Osaka Univ, Grad Sch Med H1, Dept Biochem & Mol Biol, Suita, Osaka 5650871, Japan","Montminy, M (reprint author), Salk Inst Biol Studies, Peptide Biol Labs, 10010 N Torrey Pines Rd, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA.",montminy@salk.edu,"Boussouar, Faycal/N-2511-2013; Koo, Seung-Hoi/E-2763-2015","Koo, Seung-Hoi/0000-0001-8769-2879; Screaton, Robert/0000-0002-4917-9473; Qi, Ling/0000-0001-8229-0184; Brindle, Paul/0000-0001-7172-8478",,,,32,534,565,1,47,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,20-Oct,2005,437,7062,,,,,1109,1114,,10.1038/nature03967,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,975KD,WOS:000232660500034,16148943,No,,,11/20/17

The recent claimed detection of calcite associated with amorphous silicates in two planetary nebulae(3) and protostars(4,5) devoid of planetary bodies questions the relevance of this indicator; but in the absence of an alternative mode of formation under circumstellar conditions, this detection remains controversial(6-8). The main dust component observed in circumstellar envelopes is amorphous silicates(9), which are thought to have formed by non-equilibrium condensation(10). Here we report experiments demonstrating that carbonates can be formed with amorphous silicates during the non-equilibrium condensation of a silicate gas in a H2O-CO2-rich vapour.

Estimates of the relative and absolute ages of geological units on these objects have been based on this assumption(2). Here we present an analysis of the comparatively sparse crater population on Jupiter's icy moon Europa and suggest that this assumption is incorrect for small craters. We find that 'secondaries' (craters formed by material ejected from large primary impact craters) comprise about 95 per cent of the small craters (diameters less than 1 km) on Europa. We therefore conclude that large primary impacts into a solid surface (for example, ice or rock) produce far more secondaries than previously believed, implying that the small crater populations on the Moon, Mars and other large bodies must be dominated by secondaries.

Here we report the fabrication of semiconductor devices in which both the number and position of the dopant atoms are precisely controlled. To achieve this, we make use of a recently developed single-ion implantation technique(6-9), which enables us to implant dopant ions one-by-one into a fine semiconductor region until the desired number is reached. Electrical measurements of the resulting transistors reveal that device-to-device fluctuations in the threshold voltage (V-th; the turn-on voltage of the device) are less for those structures with ordered dopant arrays than for those with conventional random doping. We also find that the devices with ordered dopant arrays exhibit a shift in V-th, relative to the undoped semiconductor, that is twice that for a random dopant distribution (-0.4 V versus -0.2 V); we attribute this to the uniformity of electrostatic potential in the conducting channel region due to the ordered distribution of dopant atoms. Our results therefore serve to highlight the improvements in device performance that can be achieved through atomic-scale control of the doping process.

The introduction of catalytic systems using oxygen from air is preferred for 'green' processing(2). Gold catalysis is now showing potential in selective redox processes(3-6), particularly for alcohol oxidation(7-10) and the direct synthesis of hydrogen peroxide(11,12). However, a major challenge that persists is the synthesis of an epoxide by the direct electrophilic addition of oxygen to an alkene(13). Although ethene is epoxidized efficiently using molecular oxygen with silver catalysts in a large-scale industrial process(14), this is unique because higher alkenes can only be effectively epoxidized using hydrogen peroxide(15-17), hydroperoxides(16) or stoichiometric oxygen donors. Here we show that nanocrystalline gold catalysts can provide tunable active catalysts for the oxidation of alkenes using air, with exceptionally high selectivity to partial oxidation products (similar to 98%) and significant conversions. Our finding significantly extends the discovery by Haruta(18,19) that nanocrystalline gold can epoxidize alkenes when hydrogen is used to activate the molecular oxygen; in our case, no sacrificial reductant is needed. We anticipate that our finding will initiate attempts to understand more fully the mechanism of oxygen activation at gold surfaces, which might lead to commercial exploitation of the high redox activity of gold nanocrystals.","Cardiff Univ, Sch Chem, Cardiff CF10 3AT, Wales; Johnson Matthey Catalysts, Middlesbrough TS23 1LB, England; Johnson Matthey Catalysts, Royston SG8 5HE, Herts, England; Lehigh Univ, Ctr Adv Mat & Nanotechnol, Bethlehem, PA 18015 USA","Hutchings, GJ (reprint author), Cardiff Univ, Sch Chem, Main Bldg,Pk Pl, Cardiff CF10 3AT, Wales.",hutch@cardiff.ac.uk,"Kiely, Christopher/B-1959-2008; Carley, Albert/A-7372-2010; Xu, Yi-Jun/B-2566-2016","Xu, Yi-Jun/0000-0002-2195-1695",,,,24,708,724,31,430,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,20-Oct,2005,437,7062,,,,,1132,1135,,10.1038/nature04190,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,975KD,WOS:000232660500039,16237439,No,,,11/20/17

The Pacific anomaly, on the other hand, appears to be more rounded in shape(1-4,6,7,11). Mantle models with heterogeneous composition have related these structures to dense thermochemical piles or superplumes(12-19). It has not been shown, however, that such models can lead to thermochemical structures that satisfy the geometrical constraints, as inferred from seismological observations. Here we present numerical models of thermochemical convection in a three-dimensional spherical geometry using plate velocities inferred for the past 119 million years(20). We show that Earth's subduction history can lead to thermochemical structures similar in shape to the observed large, lower-mantle velocity anomalies.

The plesiomorphic composition of the arthropod head remains enigmatic because variation in segments and corresponding appendages is extreme. Within extant arthropod classes (Chelicerata, Myriapoda, Crustacea and Hexapoda-including the insects), correspondences between the appendage-bearing second (deutocerebral) and third (tritocerebral) cephalic neuromeres have been recently resolved on the basis of immunohistochemistry(1) and Hox gene expression patterns(3,4). However, no appendage targets the first ganglion, the protocerebrum, and the corresponding segmental identity of this anterior region remains unclear(5). Reconstructions of stem-group arthropods indicate that the anteriormost region originally might have borne an ocular apparatus and a frontal appendage innervated by the protocerebrum(6). However, no study of the central nervous system in extant arthropods has been able to corroborate this idea directly, although recent analyses of cephalic gene expression patterns in insects suggest a segmental status for the protocerebral region(7-10). Here we investigate the developmental neuroanatomy of a putative basal arthropod(11), the pycnogonid sea spider, with immunohistochemical techniques. We show that the first pair of appendages, the chelifores, are innervated at an anterior position on the protocerebrum. This is the first true appendage shown to be innervated by the protocerebrum, and thus pycnogonid chelifores are not positionally homologous to appendages of extant arthropods but might, in fact, be homologous to the 'great appendages' of certain Cambrian stem-group arthropods.","Harvard Univ, Dept Organism & Evolutionary Biol, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; Harvard Univ, Museum Comparat Zool, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; Univ Hawaii, Pacific Biosci Res Ctr, Kewalo Marine Lab, Honolulu, HI 96813 USA","Maxmen, A (reprint author), Harvard Univ, Dept Organism & Evolutionary Biol, 26 Oxford St, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",amaxmen@oeb.harvard.edu,"Browne, William/D-4267-2013; Giribet, Gonzalo/P-1086-2015","Browne, William/0000-0001-8200-6489; Giribet, Gonzalo/0000-0002-5467-8429",,,,32,61,62,1,14,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,20-Oct,2005,437,7062,,,,,1144,1148,,10.1038/nature03984,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,975KD,WOS:000232660500042,16237442,No,,,11/20/17

Here I show that several classes of non-coding DNA in Drosophila are evolving considerably slower than synonymous sites, and yet show an excess of between-species divergence relative to polymorphism when compared with synonymous sites. The former is a hallmark of selective constraint, but the latter is a signature of adaptive evolution, resembling general patterns of protein evolution in Drosophila(1,2). I estimate that about 40-70% of nucleotides in intergenic regions, untranslated portions of mature mRNAs ( UTRs) and most intronic DNA are evolutionarily constrained relative to synonymous sites. However, I also use an extension to the McDonald-Kreitman test(3) to show that a substantial fraction of the nucleotide divergence in these regions was driven to fixation by positive selection (about 20% for most intronic and intergenic DNA, and 60% for UTRs). On the basis of these observations, I suggest that a large fraction of the non-translated genome is functionally important and subject to both purifying selection and adaptive evolution.

The extent to which weak negative and positive darwinian selection have driven the molecular evolution of different species varies greatly(5-16), with some species, such as Drosophila melanogaster, showing strong evidence of pervasive positive selection(6-9), and others, such as the selfing weed Arabidopsis thaliana, showing an excess of deleterious variation within local populations(9,10). Here we contrast patterns of coding sequence polymorphism identified by direct sequencing of 39 humans for over 11,000 genes to divergence between humans and chimpanzees, and find strong evidence that natural selection has shaped the recent molecular evolution of our species. Our analysis discovered 304 (9.0%) out of 3,377 potentially informative loci showing evidence of rapid amino acid evolution. Furthermore, 813 (13.5%) out of 6,033 potentially informative loci show a paucity of amino acid differences between humans and chimpanzees, indicating weak negative selection and/or balancing selection operating on mutations at these loci. We find that the distribution of negatively and positively selected genes varies greatly among biological processes and molecular functions, and that some classes, such as transcription factors, show an excess of rapidly evolving genes, whereas others, such as cytoskeletal proteins, show an excess of genes with extensive amino acid polymorphism within humans and yet little amino acid divergence between humans and chimpanzees.","Cornell Univ, Dept Biol Stat & Computat Biol, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; Univ Copenhagen, Ctr Bioinformat, DK-2100 Copenhagen, Denmark; Appl Biosyst Inc, Rockville, MD 20850 USA; Celera Diagnost, Alameda, CA 94502 USA; Case Western Reserve Univ, Dept Genet, Cleveland, OH 44106 USA; Cornell Univ, Dept Mol Biol & Genet, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA","Bustamante, CD (reprint author), Cornell Univ, Dept Biol Stat & Computat Biol, 101 Biotechnol Bldg, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",cdb28@cornell.edu,"Nielsen, Rasmus/D-4405-2009","Nielsen, Rasmus/0000-0003-0513-6591","NHGRI NIH HHS [R01 HG003229, R01 HG003229-01]",,,24,516,524,3,106,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,20-Oct,2005,437,7062,,,,,1153,1157,,10.1038/nature04240,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,975KD,WOS:000232660500044,16237444,No,,,11/20/17

Yet regaining a habit can occur quickly, with even one or a few exposures to cues previously triggering the behaviour(1-3). To identify neural mechanisms that might underlie such learning dynamics, we made long-term recordings from multiple neurons in the sensorimotor striatum, a basal ganglia structure implicated in habit formation(4-8), in rats successively trained on a reward-based procedural task, given extinction training and then given reacquisition training. The spike activity of striatal output neurons, nodal points in cortico-basal ganglia circuits, changed markedly across multiple dimensions during each of these phases of learning. First, new patterns of task-related ensemble firing successively formed, reversed and then re-emerged. Second, task-irrelevant firing was suppressed, then rebounded, and then was suppressed again. These changing spike activity patterns were highly correlated with changes in behavioural performance. We propose that these changes in task representation in cortico-basal ganglia circuits represent neural equivalents of the explore-exploit behaviour characteristic of habit learning.","MIT, Dept Brain & Cognit Sci, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; MIT, McGovern Inst Brain Res, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; Penn State Univ, Dept Phys, Davey Lab 0104, University Pk, PA 16802 USA","Graybiel, AM (reprint author), MIT, Dept Brain & Cognit Sci, 43 Vassar St,46-6133, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",graybiel@mit.edu,,,NIMH NIH HHS [R01 MH060379]; NINDS NIH HHS [P50 NS038372],,,30,309,312,1,40,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,20-Oct,2005,437,7062,,,,,1158,1161,,10.1038/nature04053,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,975KD,WOS:000232660500045,16237445,No,,,11/20/17

The human influenza A virus continues to thrive even among populations with widespread access to vaccines, and continues to be a major cause of morbidity and mortality(1,2). The virus mutates from year to year, making the existing vaccines ineffective on a regular basis, and requiring that new strains be chosen for a new vaccine. Less-frequent major changes, known as antigenic shift, create new strains against which the human population has little protective immunity, thereby causing worldwide pandemics. The most recent pandemics include the 1918 'Spanish' flu, one of the most deadly outbreaks in recorded history, which killed 30-50 million people worldwide, the 1957 'Asian' flu, and the 1968 'Hong Kong' flu(3). Motivated by the need for a better understanding of influenza evolution, we have developed flexible protocols that make it possible to apply large-scale sequencing techniques to the highly variable influenza genome. Here we report the results of sequencing 209 complete genomes of the human influenza A virus, encompassing a total of 2,821,103 nucleotides. In addition to increasing markedly the number of publicly available, complete influenza virus genomes, we have discovered several anomalies in these first 209 genomes that demonstrate the dynamic nature of influenza transmission and evolution. This new, large-scale sequencing effort promises to provide a more comprehensive picture of the evolution of influenza viruses and of their pattern of transmission through human and animal populations.

One of these viral 'signatures', double-stranded (ds) RNA, is a replication product of most viruses within infected cells and is sensed by Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) and the recently identified cytosolic RNA helicases RIG-I (retinoic acid inducible gene I, also known as Ddx58) and Mda5 (melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5, also known as Ifih1 or Helicard)(1). Both helicases detect dsRNA, and through their protein-interacting CARD domains, relay an undefined signal resulting in the activation of the transcription factors interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) and NF-kappa B. Here we describe Cardif, a new CARD-containing adaptor protein that interacts with RIG-I and recruits IKK alpha, IKK beta and IKK epsilon kinases by means of its C-terminal region, leading to the activation of NF-kappa B and IRF3. Overexpression of Cardif results in interferon-beta and NF-kappa B promoter activation, and knockdown of Cardif by short interfering RNA inhibits RIG-I-dependent antiviral responses. Cardif is targeted and inactivated by NS3-4A, a serine protease from hepatitis C virus known to block interferon-beta production. Cardif thus functions as an adaptor, linking the cytoplasmic dsRNA receptor RIG-I to the initiation of antiviral programmes.","Univ Lausanne, Dept Biochem, BIL Biomed Res Ctr, CH-1066 Epalinges, Switzerland; Univ Geneva, Fac Med, Dept Microbiol & Mol Med, CH-1211 Geneva, Switzerland; MEMOREC Biotec GmbH, D-50829 Cologne, Germany; CHU Vaudois, Div Gastroenterol & Hepatol, CH-1011 Lausanne, Switzerland; Univ Heidelberg, Dept Mol Virol, D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany","Tschopp, R (reprint author), Univ Lausanne, Dept Biochem, BIL Biomed Res Ctr, Chemin Boveresses 155, CH-1066 Epalinges, Switzerland.",jurg.tschopp@unil.ch,"Binder, Marco/E-9717-2011; Bartenschlager, Ralf/L-2582-2015","Binder, Marco/0000-0002-5805-6109; Meylan, Etienne/0000-0002-0899-2230; Moradpour, Darius/0000-0003-1977-6792",,,,32,1419,1510,6,87,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,20-Oct,2005,437,7062,,,,,1167,1172,,10.1038/nature04193,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,975KD,WOS:000232660500047,16177806,No,,,11/20/17

Here we describe an initial version of a proteome-scale map of human binary protein-protein interactions. Using a stringent, high-throughput yeast two-hybrid system, we tested pairwise interactions among the products of similar to 8,100 currently available Gateway-cloned open reading frames and detected similar to 2,800 interactions.

The CCSB-HI1 data set increases by similar to 70% the set of available binary interactions within the tested space and reveals more than 300 new connections to over 100 disease-associated proteins.

This involves, in the short term, phosphorylation of photosystem II (PSII) and light-harvesting (LHCII) proteins. PSII phosphorylation is thought to be relevant for PSII turnover(1,2), whereas LHCII phosphorylation is associated with the relocation of LHCII and the redistribution of excitation energy (state transitions) between photosystems(3,4). In the long term, imbalances in energy distribution between photosystems are counteracted by adjusting photosystem stoichiometry(5,6). In the green alga Chlamydomonas and the plant Arabidopsis, state transitions require the orthologous protein kinases STT7 and STN7, respectively(7,8). Here we show that in Arabidopsis a second protein kinase, STN8, is required for the quantitative phosphorylation of PSII core proteins. However, PSII activity under high-intensity light is affected only slightly in stn8 mutants, and D1 turnover is indistinguishable from the wild type, implying that reversible protein phosphorylation is not essential for PSII repair. Acclimation to changes in light quality is defective in stn7 but not in stn8 mutants, indicating that short-term and long-term photosynthetic adaptations are coupled. Therefore the phosphorylation of LHCII, or of an unknown substrate of STN7, is also crucial for the control of photosynthetic gene expression.","Univ Munich, Dept Biol 1, Inst Bot, D-80638 Munich, Germany; Max Planck Inst Zuchtungsforsch, Abt Pflanzenzuchtung & Genet, D-50829 Cologne, Germany; Fdn Parco Tecnol Padano, I-26900 Lodi, Italy; Univ Jena, Lehrstuhl Pflanzenphysiol, D-07743 Jena, Germany; Univ Dusseldorf, Inst Biochem Pflanzen, D-40225 Dusseldorf, Germany","Leister, D (reprint author), Univ Munich, Dept Biol 1, Inst Bot, Menzinger Str 67, D-80638 Munich, Germany.",leister@lrz.uni-muenchen.de,"Schleiff, Enrico/C-5105-2017; Leister, Dario/D-5587-2009","Schleiff, Enrico/0000-0002-0518-3489; Leister, Dario/0000-0003-1897-8421; Pesaresi, Paolo/0000-0002-3236-7005",,,,30,267,284,1,49,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,20-Oct,2005,437,7062,,,,,1179,1182,,10.1038/nature04016,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,975KD,WOS:000232660500049,16237446,No,,,11/20/17

Z-DNA is also stabilized by specific protein binding; several proteins have been identified with low nanomolar binding constants(5-9). Z-DNA occurs in a dynamic state, forming as a result of physiological processes then relaxing to the right-handed B-DNA(1). Each time a DNA segment turns into Z-DNA, two B-Z junctions form. These have been examined extensively(10-12), but their structure was unknown. Here we describe the structure of a B-Z junction as revealed by X-ray crystallography at 2.6 angstrom resolution. A 15-base-pair segment of DNA is stabilized at one end in the Z conformation by Z-DNA binding proteins, while the other end remains B-DNA.

Such coordination may be partly achieved at the level of messenger RNA stability(1), in which the targeted destruction of subsets of transcripts generates the potential for cross-regulating metabolic pathways. In Escherichia coli, the balance and composition of the transcript population is affected by RNase E, an essential endoribonuclease that not only turns over RNA but also processes certain key RNA precursors(2-10). RNase E cleaves RNA internally, but its catalytic power is determined by the 50 terminus of the substrate, even if this lies at a distance from the cutting site(11-14). Here we report crystal structures of the catalytic domain of RNase E as trapped allosteric intermediates with RNA substrates. Four subunits of RNase E catalytic domain associate into an interwoven quaternary structure, explaining why the subunit organization is required for catalytic activity. The subdomain encompassing the active site is structurally congruent to a deoxyribonuclease, making an unexpected link in the evolutionary history of RNA and DNA nucleases. The structure explains how the recognition of the 50 terminus of the substrate may trigger catalysis and also sheds light on the question of how RNase E might selectively process, rather than destroy, specific RNA precursors.","Univ Cambridge, Dept Biochem, Cambridge CB2 1GA, England; Univ Leeds, Astbury Ctr Struct Mol Biol, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England; Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Chem & Biochem, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA; Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Sinsheimer Labs, Ctr Mol Biol RNA, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA","Luisi, BF (reprint author), Univ Cambridge, Dept Biochem, 80 Tennis Court Rd, Cambridge CB2 1GA, England.",ben@cryst.bioc.cam.ac.uk,"Marcaida, Maria Jose/I-1644-2017","Marcaida, Maria Jose/0000-0003-0663-5309",Wellcome Trust,,,30,155,158,3,21,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,20-Oct,2005,437,7062,,,,,1187,1191,,10.1038/nature04084,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,975KD,WOS:000232660500051,16237448,No,,,11/20/17

The resulting data reveal aspects of the earthquake process never before seen. Here we show what these data, when combined with data from earlier Parkfield earthquakes, tell us about earthquake physics and earthquake prediction. The 2004 Parkfield earthquake, with its lack of obvious precursors, demonstrates that reliable short-term earthquake prediction still is not achievable.

Plectasin has primary, secondary and tertiary structures that closely resemble those of defensins found in spiders, scorpions, dragonflies and mussels. Recombinant plectasin was produced at a very high, and commercially viable, yield and purity. In vitro, the recombinant peptide was especially active against Streptococcus pneumoniae, including strains resistant to conventional antibiotics. Plectasin showed extremely low toxicity in mice, and cured them of experimental peritonitis and pneumonia caused by S. pneumoniae as efficaciously as vancomycin and penicillin. These findings identify fungi as a novel source of antimicrobial defensins, and show the therapeutic potential of plectasin.

Erosion and redeposition of putative circumpolar mud volcano deposits(15) ( formed by eruption of liquefied, fine-grained material) led to the formation of an Early Amazonian polar plateau consisting of dark layered materials. Crater ejecta superposed on pedestals indicate that a thin mantle was present during most of the Amazonian, suggesting generally higher obliquity and insolation conditions at the poles than at present. Brighter polar layered deposits rest unconformably on the dark layers and formed mainly during lower obliquity over the past 4 - 5Myr (ref. 20).

First suggested as a mechanism for the cyclic recurrence of ice ages, stochastic resonance has been seen in a wide variety of macroscopic physical systems: bistable ring lasers(3), superconducting quantum interference devices(4,5) (SQUIDs), magnetoelastic ribbons(6) and neurophysiological systems such as the receptors in crickets(7) and crayfish(8). Although fundamentally important as a mechanism of coherent signal amplification, stochastic resonance has yet to be observed in nanoscale systems. Here we report the observation of stochastic resonance in bistable nanomechanical silicon oscillators. Our nanomechanical systems consist of beams that are clamped at each end and driven into transverse oscillation with the use of a radiofrequency source. Modulation of the source induces controllable switching of the beams between two stable, distinct states. We observe that the addition of white noise causes a marked amplification of the signal strength.

Resilin is found in specialized regions of the cuticle of most insects, providing low stiffness, high strain and efficient energy storage(1,2); it is best known for its roles in insect flight(3,4) and the remarkable jumping ability of fleas(5,6) and spittle bugs(7). Previously, the Drosophila melanogaster CG15920 gene was tentatively identified as one encoding a resilin-like protein(8,9) (pro-resilin). Here we report the cloning and expression of the first exon of the Drosophila CG15920 gene as a soluble protein in Escherichia coli. We show that this recombinant protein can be cast into a rubber-like biomaterial by rapid photochemical crosslinking. This observation validates the role of the putative elastic repeat motif in resilin function. The resilience ( recovery after deformation) of crosslinked recombinant resilin was found to exceed that of unfilled synthetic polybutadiene, a high resilience rubber. We believe that our work will greatly facilitate structural investigations into the functional properties of resilin and shed light on more general aspects of the structure of elastomeric proteins.

Long-term precipitation changes in the regions of northern and southern Africa influenced by the monsoons are thought to have been governed by precessional variations in summer insolation(1,2). Conversely, short-term precipitation changes in the northern African tropics have been linked to North Atlantic sea surface temperature anomalies, affecting the northward extension of the Intertropical Convergence Zone and its associated rainbelt(3,4). Our knowledge of large-scale hydrological changes in equatorial Africa and their forcing factors is, however, limited(5). Here we analyse the isotopic composition of terrigenous plant lipids, extracted from a marine sediment core close to the Congo River mouth, in order to reconstruct past central African rainfall variations and compare this record to sea surface temperature changes in the South Atlantic Ocean. We find that central African precipitation during the past 20,000 years was mainly controlled by the difference in sea surface temperatures between the tropics and subtropics of the South Atlantic Ocean, whereas we find no evidence that changes in the position of the Intertropical Convergence Zone had a significant influence on the overall moisture availability in central Africa.

Here we show that mammalian Smoothened (Smo), a seven-transmembrane protein essential for Hh signalling(3), is expressed on the primary cilium. This ciliary expression is regulated by Hh pathway activity; Sonic hedgehog or activating mutations in Smo promote ciliary localization, whereas the Smo antagonist cyclopamine inhibits ciliary localization. The translocation of Smo to primary cilia depends upon a conserved hydrophobic and basic residue sequence homologous to a domain previously shown to be required for the ciliary localization of seven-transmembrane proteins in Caenorhabditis elegans(4). Mutation of this domain not only prevents ciliary localization but also eliminates Smo activity both in cultured cells and in zebrafish embryos. Thus, Hh-dependent translocation to cilia is essential for Smo activity, suggesting that Smo acts at the primary cilium.","Univ Calif San Francisco, Dev & Stem Cell Biol Program, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; Univ Calif San Francisco, Ctr Diabet, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Biochem & Biophys, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA","Reiter, JF (reprint author), Univ Calif San Francisco, Dev & Stem Cell Biol Program, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA.",jreiter@diabetes.ucsf.edu,,"Aanstad, Pia/0000-0003-3893-2973; Stainier, Didier/0000-0002-0382-0026",,,,29,735,750,3,54,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,13-Oct,2005,437,7061,,,,,1018,1021,,10.1038/nature04117,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,973AU,WOS:000232496100044,16136078,No,,,11/20/17

Once specified, leaves differentiate an adaxial ( upper) side specialized for light capture, and an abaxial ( lower) side specialized for gas exchange. A functional relationship between meristem activity and the differentiation of adaxial leaf fate has been recognized for over fifty years, but the molecular basis of this interaction is unclear. In Arabidopsis thaliana, activity of the class I KNOX (KNOTTED1-like homeobox) genes SHOOTMERISTEMLESS (STM) and BREVIPEDICELLUS ( BP) is required for meristem function but excluded from leaves(1-3), whereas members of the HD-Zip III ( class III homeodomain leucine zipper) protein family function to promote both meristem activity and adaxial leaf fate(4-6). Here we show that the zinc-finger protein SERRATE acts in a microRNA ( miRNA) gene-silencing pathway to regulate expression of the HD-Zip III gene PHABULOSA (PHB) while also limiting the competence of shoot tissue to respond to KNOX expression. Thus, SERRATE acts to coordinately regulate meristem activity and leaf axial patterning.","Univ Oxford, Dept Plant Sci, Oxford OX1 3RB, England","Tsiantis, M (reprint author), Univ Oxford, Dept Plant Sci, S Parks Rd, Oxford OX1 3RB, England.",miltos.tsiantis@plants.ox.ac.uk,,,,,,22,125,134,0,30,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,13-Oct,2005,437,7061,,,,,1022,1026,,10.1038/nature04052,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,973AU,WOS:000232496100045,16222298,No,,,11/20/17

Changes in synaptic plasticity in dopamine neurons of the ventral tegmental area (VTA) may contribute to circuit modification induced by many drugs of abuse, including cocaine(6-13). Here we report that, following repeated exposure to cocaine in vivo, excitatory synapses to rat VTA dopamine neurons become highly susceptible to the induction of long-term potentiation (LTP) by correlated pre- and postsynaptic activity. This facilitated LTP induction is caused by cocaine-induced reduction of GABA(A) (gamma-aminobutyric acid) receptor- mediated inhibition of these dopamine neurons. In midbrain slices from rats treated with saline or a single dose of cocaine, LTP could not be induced in VTA dopamine neurons unless GABA-mediated inhibition was reduced by bicuculline or picrotoxin. However, LTP became readily inducible in slices from rats treated repeatedly with cocaine; this LTP induction was prevented by enhancing GABA-mediated inhibition using diazepam. Furthermore, repeated cocaine exposure reduced the amplitude of GABA-mediated synaptic currents and increased the probability of spike initiation in VTA dopamine neurons. This cocaine-induced enhancement of synaptic plasticity in the VTA may be important for the formation of drug-associated memory.","Univ Calif Berkeley, Helen Wills Neurosci Inst, Dept Mol & Cell Biol, Div Neurobiol, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA","Poo, MM (reprint author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Helen Wills Neurosci Inst, Dept Mol & Cell Biol, Div Neurobiol, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",qsliu@berkeley.edu; mpoo@berkeley.edu,"yu, yan/C-2322-2012",,"NINDS NIH HHS [R01 NS036999, R01 NS037831]",,,30,197,200,0,12,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,13-Oct,2005,437,7061,,,,,1027,1031,,10.1038/nature04050,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,973AU,WOS:000232496100046,16222299,No,,,11/20/17

Here we present a structured network knowledge-base approach to analyse genome-wide transcriptional responses in the context of known functional interrelationships among proteins, small molecules and phenotypes. This approach was used to analyse changes in blood leukocyte gene expression patterns in human subjects receiving an inflammatory stimulus ( bacterial endotoxin). We explore the known genome-wide interaction network to identify significant functional modules perturbed in response to this stimulus. Our analysis reveals that the human blood leukocyte response to acute systemic inflammation includes the transient dysregulation of leukocyte bioenergetics and modulation of translational machinery. These findings provide insight into the regulation of global leukocyte activities as they relate to innate immune system tolerance and increased susceptibility to infection in humans.","Stanford Genome Technol Ctr, Palo Alto, CA 94304 USA; Univ Med & Dent New Jersey, Robert Wood Johnson Med Sch, Dept Surg, New Brunswick, NJ 08903 USA; Ingenuity Syst Inc, Mountain View, CA 94043 USA; Univ Florida, Coll Med, Dept Mol Genet & Microbiol, Gainesville, FL 32610 USA; Univ Florida, Coll Med, Dept Surg, Gainesville, FL 32610 USA; Washington Univ, Dept Surg, St Louis, MO 63110 USA; Univ Rochester, Sch Med, Dept Surg, Rochester, NY 14642 USA; Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Dept Surg, Boston, MA 02114 USA","Davis, RW (reprint author), Stanford Genome Technol Ctr, Palo Alto, CA 94304 USA.",dbowe@stanford.edu,,"Baker, Henry/0000-0002-8273-5320; xiao, wenzhong/0000-0003-4944-6380",NIGMS NIH HHS [U54 GM062119],,,24,928,964,4,52,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,13-Oct,2005,437,7061,,,,,1032,1037,,10.1038/nature03985,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,973AU,WOS:000232496100047,16136080,No,,,11/20/17

It has been assumed that nondisjunction of a chromosome during mitosis will yield two aneuploid daughter cells. Here we show that chromosome nondisjunction is tightly coupled to regulation of cytokinesis in human cell lines, such that nondisjunction results in the formation of tetraploid rather than aneuploid cells. We observed that spontaneously arising binucleated cells exhibited chromosome mis-segregation rates up to 166-fold higher than the overall mitotic population. Long-term imaging experiments indicated that most binucleated cells arose through a bipolar mitosis followed by regression of the cleavage furrow hours later. Nondisjunction occurred with high frequency in cells that became binucleated by furrow regression, but not in cells that completed cytokinesis to form two mononucleated cells. Our findings indicate that nondisjunction does not directly yield aneuploid cells, but rather tetraploid cells that may subsequently become aneuploid through further division. The coupling of spontaneous segregation errors to furrow regression provides a potential explanation for the prevalence of hyperdiploid chromosome number and centrosome amplification observed in many cancers(8,9).","Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Cell Biol, Boston, MA 02115 USA","King, RW (reprint author), Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Cell Biol, 240 Longwood Ave, Boston, MA 02115 USA.",randy_king@hms.harvard.edu,"Yang, Weimei/N-2928-2013; Shi, Qinghua/N-2950-2013","King, Randall/0000-0001-7882-8180",,,,30,260,268,0,17,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,13-Oct,2005,437,7061,,,,,1038,1042,,10.1038/nature03958,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,973AU,WOS:000232496100048,16222248,No,,,11/20/17

Here we test this idea by transiently blocking cytokinesis in p53-null (p53(-/-)) mouse mammary epithelial cells (MMECs), enabling the isolation of diploid and tetraploid cultures. The tetraploid cells had an increase in the frequency of whole-chromosome mis-segregation and chromosomal rearrangements. Only the tetraploid cells were transformed in vitro after exposure to a carcinogen. Furthermore, in the absence of carcinogen, only the tetraploid cells gave rise to malignant mammary epithelial cancers when transplanted subcutaneously into nude mice. These tumours all contained numerous non-reciprocal translocations and an 8-30-fold amplification of a chromosomal region containing a cluster of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) genes. MMP overexpression is linked to mammary tumours in humans and animal models(4). Thus, tetraploidy enhances the frequency of chromosomal alterations and promotes tumour development in p53(-/-) MMECs.","Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dana Farber Canc Inst, Dept Pediat Oncol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dana Farber Canc Inst, Dept Med Oncol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Childrens Hosp, Boston, MA 02115 USA; Tufts Univ, Sch Vet, Dept Biomed Sci, North Grafton, MA 01536 USA","Pellman, D (reprint author), Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dana Farber Canc Inst, Dept Pediat Oncol, 44 Binney St, Boston, MA 02115 USA.",david_pellman@dfci.harvard.edu,,,,,,30,548,554,2,19,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,13-Oct,2005,437,7061,,,,,1043,1047,,10.1038/nature04217,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,973AU,WOS:000232496100049,16222300,No,,,11/20/17

This activity inhibits the anaphase-promoting complex/ cyclosome (APC/C), a ubiquitin ligase that triggers anaphase onset and mitotic/meiotic exit by targeting securin and M-phase cyclins for destruction(3,4,5). On fertilization a transient rise in free intracellular calcium(6) causes release from CSF arrest and thus APC/C activation. Although it has previously been shown that calcium induces the release of APC/C from CSF inhibition through calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II ( CaMKII)(7,8), the relevant substrates of this kinase have not been identified. Recently, we characterized XErp1 (Emi2), an inhibitor of the APC/C and key component of CSF activity in Xenopus egg extract(9). Here we show that calcium-activated CaMKII triggers exit from meiosis II by sensitizing the APC/C inhibitor XErp1 for polo-like kinase 1 (Plx1)-dependent degradation. Phosphorylation of XErp1 by CaMKII leads to the recruitment of Plx1 that in turn triggers the destruction of XErp1 by phosphorylating a site known to serve as a phosphorylation-dependent degradation signal. These results provide a molecular explanation for how the fertilization-induced calcium increase triggers exit from meiosis II.","Max Planck Inst Biochem, Independent Res Grp, D-82152 Martinsried, Germany; Max Planck Inst Biochem, Dept Cell Biol, D-82152 Martinsried, Germany","Mayer, TU (reprint author), Max Planck Inst Biochem, Independent Res Grp, Klopferspitz 18, D-82152 Martinsried, Germany.",mayer@biochem.mpg.de,,"nigg, erich/0000-0003-4835-5719",,,,22,155,162,1,10,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,13-Oct,2005,437,7061,,,,,1048,1052,,10.1038/nature04093,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,973AU,WOS:000232496100050,16127448,No,,,11/20/17

Questions such as whether there are genuine folding intermediates, and whether the events at the earliest stages are just rearrangements of the denatured state(1) or progress from populated transition states(2), remain unresolved. The problem is that there is a lack of experimental high-resolution structural information about early folding intermediates and denatured states under conditions that favour folding because competent states spontaneously fold rapidly. Here we have solved directly the solution structure of a true denatured state by nuclear magnetic resonance under conditions that would normally favour folding, and directly studied its equilibrium and kinetic behaviour. We engineered a mutant of Drosophila melanogaster Engrailed homeodomain that folds and unfolds reversibly just by changing ionic strength. At high ionic strength, the mutant L16A is an ultra-fast folding native protein, just like the wild-type protein; however, at physiological ionic strength it is denatured. The denatured state is a well-ordered folding intermediate, poised to fold by docking helices and breaking some non-native interactions. It unfolds relatively progressively with increasingly denaturing conditions, and so superficially resembles a denatured state with properties that vary with conditions. Such ill-defined unfolding is a common feature of early folding intermediate states and accounts for why there are so many controversies about intermediates versus compact denatured states in protein folding.","MRC Ctr, Ctr Prot Engn, Cambridge CB2 2QH, England; Univ Cambridge, MRC Ctr, Chem Labs, Cambridge CB2 2QH, England","Fersht, AR (reprint author), MRC Ctr, Ctr Prot Engn, Hills Rd, Cambridge CB2 2QH, England.",arf25@cam.ac.uk,,"Markson, Joseph/0000-0002-3167-3887; Mayor, Ugo/0000-0003-2812-8287",,,,24,183,186,1,8,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,13-Oct,2005,437,7061,,,,,1053,1056,,10.1038/nature04054,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,973AU,WOS:000232496100051,16222301,No,,,11/20/17

One molecule of CED-9 binds to an asymmetric dimer of CED-4, but specifically recognizes only one of the two CED-4 molecules. This specific interaction prevents CED-4 from activating CED-3. EGL-1 binding induces pronounced conformational changes in CED-9 that result in the dissociation of the CED-4 dimer from CED-9.

Here we present the discovery of the X-ray afterglow of a short-hard burst, GRB 050709, whose accurate position allows us to associate it unambiguously with a star-forming galaxy at redshift z = 0.160, and whose optical lightcurve definitively excludes a supernova association. Together with results from three other recent short-hard bursts, this suggests that short-hard bursts release much less energy than the long-duration GRBs.

X-ray localizations have recently become available(8,9) for short ( duration < 2 s) GRBs, which have evaded optical detection for more than 30 years. Here we report the first discovery of transient optical emission (R-band magnitude similar to 23) associated with a short burst: GRB 050709. The optical afterglow was localized with subarcsecond accuracy, and lies in the outskirts of a blue dwarf galaxy. The optical and X-ray(10) afterglow properties 34 h after the GRB are reminiscent of the afterglows of long GRBs, which are attributable to synchrotron emission from ultrarelativistic ejecta. We did not, however, detect a supernova, as found in most nearby long GRB afterglows, which suggests a different origin for the short GRBs.","Univ Copenhagen, Niels Bohr Inst, Dark Cosmol Ctr, DK-2100 Copenhagen, Denmark; Univ Hawaii, Inst Astron, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; European So Observ, Santiago 19, Chile; CSIC, Inst Astrofis Andalucia, E-18080 Granada, Spain; Stockholm Univ, Dept Astron, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden; NASA, George C Marshall Space Flight Ctr, Natl Space Sci Technol Ctr, Huntsville, AL 35805 USA","Hjorth, J (reprint author), Univ Copenhagen, Niels Bohr Inst, Dark Cosmol Ctr, Juliane Maries Vej, DK-2100 Copenhagen, Denmark.",jens@astro.ku.dk,"Fynbo, Johan/L-8496-2014; Hjorth, Jens/M-5787-2014; Watson, Darach/E-4521-2015; Jensen, Brian Lindgren/E-1275-2015; Jakobsson, Pall/L-9950-2015","Fynbo, Johan/0000-0002-8149-8298; Hjorth, Jens/0000-0002-4571-2306; Watson, Darach/0000-0002-4465-8264; Jensen, Brian Lindgren/0000-0002-0906-9771; Jakobsson, Pall/0000-0002-9404-5650",,,,26,219,220,1,2,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,6-Oct,2005,437,7060,,,,,859,861,,10.1038/nature04174,,3,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,970VB,WOS:000232338600040,16208365,No,,,11/20/17

For example, bacterial flagella are helically shaped(2) and driven at their bases by a reversible rotary engine(3), which rotates the attached flagellum to give a motion similar to that of a corkscrew. In contrast, eukaryotic cells use flagella that resemble elastic rods(4) and exhibit a beating motion: internally generated stresses give rise to a series of bends that propagate towards the tip(5-7). In contrast to this variety of swimming strategies encountered in nature, a controlled swimming motion of artificial micrometre-sized structures has not yet been realized. Here we show that a linear chain of colloidal magnetic particles linked by DNA and attached to a red blood cell can act as a flexible artificial flagellum. The filament aligns with an external uniformmagnetic field and is readily actuated by oscillating a transverse field.

It marks the end of a 2.5-Gyr period dominated by anoxic and iron-rich deep oceans. However, despite rising oxygen levels and a concomitant increase in marine sulphate concentration, related to enhanced sulphide oxidation during continental weathering(4), the chemistry of the oceans in the following mid-Proterozoic interval (similar to 1.8 - 0.8 Gyr ago) probably did not yet resemble our oxygen-rich modern oceans. Recent data(5-8) indicate that marine oxygen and sulphate concentrations may have remained well below current levels during this period, with one model indicating that anoxic and sulphidic marine basins were widespread, and perhaps even globally distributed(4). Here we present hydrocarbon biomarkers ( molecular fossils) from a 1.64-Gyr-old basin in northern Australia, revealing the ecological structure of mid-Proterozoic marine communities. The biomarkers signify a marine basin with anoxic, sulphidic, sulphate-poor and permanently stratified deep waters, hostile to eukaryotic algae. Phototrophic purple sulphur bacteria ( Chromatiaceae) were detected in the geological record based on the new carotenoid biomarker okenane, and they seem to have co-existed with communities of green sulphur bacteria ( Chlorobiaceae). Collectively, the biomarkers support mounting evidence for a long-lasting Proterozoic world in which oxygen levels remained well below modern levels.","Australian Natl Univ, Res Sch Earth Sci, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia; MIT, Dept Earth Atmospher & Planetary Sci, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; Macquarie Univ, Australian Ctr Astrobiol, Sydney, NSW 2109, Australia; Harvard Univ, Dept Organism & Evolutionary Biol, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; Harvard Univ, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; Geosci Australia, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia; Univ Aberdeen, Dept Geol & Petr Geol, Aberdeen AB24 3UE, Scotland","Brocks, JJ (reprint author), Australian Natl Univ, Res Sch Earth Sci, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia.",jochen.brocks@anu.edu.au,"Brocks, Jochen/E-3920-2012","Brocks, Jochen/0000-0002-8430-8744",,,,30,257,281,4,86,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,6-Oct,2005,437,7060,,,,,866,870,,10.1038/nature04068,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,970VB,WOS:000232338600042,16208367,No,,,11/20/17

Since this observation, other large earthquakes have been shown to induce dynamic triggering at remote distances - for example, after the 1999 magnitude 7.1 Hector Mine(1) and the 2002 magnitude 7.9 Denali(4) earthquakes - and in the near-field as aftershocks(5). The physical origin of dynamic triggering, however, remains one of the least understood aspects of earthquake nucleation(1-5). The dynamic strain amplitudes from a large earthquake are exceedingly small once the waves have propagated more than several fault radii. For example, a strain wave amplitude of 10(-6) and wavelength 1 m corresponds to a displacement amplitude of about 10(-7) m. Here we show that the dynamic, elastic-nonlinear behaviour of fault gouge perturbed by a seismic wave may trigger earthquakes, even with such small strains. We base our hypothesis on recent laboratory dynamic experiments conducted in granular media, a fault gouge surrogate(6,7). From these we infer that, if the fault is weak(8-10), seismic waves cause the fault core modulus to decrease abruptly and weaken further. If the fault is already near failure, this process could therefore induce fault slip.","Los Alamos Natl Lab, Geophys Grp EES11, Los Alamos, NM 87545 USA; Univ Marne la Vallee, CNRS, UMR 8108, Lab Phys Mat Divises & Interfaces, F-77454 Marne La Vallee, France","Johnson, PA (reprint author), Los Alamos Natl Lab, Geophys Grp EES11, MS D443, Los Alamos, NM 87545 USA.",paj@lanl.gov,,,,,,28,163,168,8,41,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,6-Oct,2005,437,7060,,,,,871,874,,10.1038/nature04015,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,970VB,WOS:000232338600043,16208368,No,,,11/20/17

The discoveries also document the turnover of pterosaur faunae, with the primitive Anurognathidae and early archaeopterodactyloids being replaced by derived pterodactyloids. Furthermore, these deposits offer an opportunity to examine the interaction and competition between birds and pterosaurs - it indicates that the avian fauna during the Lower Cretaceous ( and possibly most of the Mesozoic) dominated terrestrial, inland regions, whereas pterosaurs were more abundant in coastal areas.","Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Vertebrate Paleontol & Paleoanthropol, Beijing 100044, Peoples R China; Univ Fed Rio de Janeiro, Museu Nacl, Dept Geol & Paleontol, Paleovertebrate Sector, BR-20940040 Rio De Janeiro, Brazil; Museu Ciencias Terra, Dept Nacl Prod Mineral, BR-22290240 Rio De Janeiro, Brazil","Wang, XL (reprint author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Vertebrate Paleontol & Paleoanthropol, POB 643, Beijing 100044, Peoples R China.",xlinwang@263.net; kellner@acd.ufrj.br,"Kellner, Alexander/H-1023-2015","Kellner, Alexander/0000-0001-7174-9447",,,,30,96,114,1,15,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,6-Oct,2005,437,7060,,,,,875,879,,10.1038/nature03982,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,970VB,WOS:000232338600044,16208369,No,,,11/20/17

In addition, ecologists increasingly recognize that fluxes of organisms across ecosystem boundaries can have major consequences for community dynamics(5,6). Species with complex life histories often shift habitats during their life cycles(7) and provide potent conduits coupling ecosystems(5,6). Thus, local interactions that affect predator abundance in one ecosystem ( for example a larval habitat) may have reverberating effects in another ( for example an adult habitat). Here we show that fish indirectly facilitate terrestrial plant reproduction through cascading trophic interactions across ecosystem boundaries. Fish reduce larval dragonfly abundances in ponds, leading to fewer adult dragonflies nearby. Adult dragonflies consume insect pollinators and alter their foraging behaviour. As a result, plants near ponds with fish receive more pollinator visits and are less pollen limited than plants near fish-free ponds. Our results confirm that strong species interactions can reverberate across ecosystems, and emphasize the importance of landscape-level processes in driving local species interactions.","Univ Florida, Dept Zool, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; Washington Univ, Dept Biol, St Louis, MO 63130 USA","Knight, TM (reprint author), Univ Florida, Dept Zool, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA.",tknight@biology2.wustl.edu,,,,,,28,234,245,10,283,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,6-Oct,2005,437,7060,,,,,880,883,,10.1038/nature03962,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,970VB,WOS:000232338600045,16208370,No,,,11/20/17

This plant disease is typically initiated by an abnormal swelling of the seedling roots without any sign of infection by the pathogen(1-4). This characteristic symptom is in fact caused by the macrocyclic polyketide metabolite rhizoxin that has been isolated from cultures of Rhizopus sp.(5,6). The phytotoxin exerts its destructive effect by binding to rice beta-tubulin, which results in inhibition of mitosis and cell cycle arrest(7,8). Owing to its remarkably strong antimitotic activity in most eukaryotic cells, including various human cancer cell lines, rhizoxin has attracted considerable interest as a potential antitumour drug(9,10). Here we show that rhizoxin is not biosynthesized by the fungus itself, but by endosymbiotic, that is, intracellular living, bacteria of the genus Burkholderia. Our unexpected findings unveil a remarkably complex symbiotic-pathogenic relationship that extends the fungus - plant interaction to a third, bacterial, key-player, and opens new perspectives for pest control.","HKI, Leibniz Inst Nat Prod Res & Infect Biol, D-07745 Jena, Germany","Hertweck, C (reprint author), HKI, Leibniz Inst Nat Prod Res & Infect Biol, Beutenbergstr 11a, D-07745 Jena, Germany.",Christian.Hertweck@hki-jena.de,"Partida-Martinez, Laila/A-5935-2009; Hertweck, Christian/G-1896-2014","Partida-Martinez, Laila/0000-0001-8037-2856; Hertweck, Christian/0000-0002-0367-337X",,,,28,270,281,8,88,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,6-Oct,2005,437,7060,,,,,884,888,,10.1038/nature03997,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,970VB,WOS:000232338600046,16208371,No,,,11/20/17

The polymerase protein sequences from the 1918 human influenza virus differ from avian consensus sequences at only a small number of amino acids, consistent with the hypothesis that they were derived from an avian source shortly before the pandemic. However, when compared to avian sequences, the nucleotide sequences of the 1918 polymerase genes have more synonymous differences than expected, suggesting evolutionary distance from known avian strains. Here we present sequence and phylogenetic analyses of the complete genome of the 1918 influenza virus(4-8), and propose that the 1918 virus was not a reassortant virus ( like those of the 1957 and 1968 pandemics(9,10)), but more likely an entirely avian-like virus that adapted to humans. These data support prior phylogenetic studies suggesting that the 1918 virus was derived from an avian source(11). A total of ten amino acid changes in the polymerase proteins consistently differentiate the 1918 and subsequent human influenza virus sequences from avian virus sequences. Notably, a number of the same changes have been found in recently circulating, highly pathogenic H5N1 viruses that have caused illness and death in humans and are feared to be the precursors of a new influenza pandemic. The sequence changes identified here may be important in the adaptation of influenza viruses to humans.","Armed Forces Inst Pathol, Dept Mol Pathol, Rockville, MD 20850 USA","Taubenberger, JK (reprint author), Armed Forces Inst Pathol, Dept Mol Pathol, Rockville, MD 20850 USA.",taubenberger@afip.osd.mil,,,,,,30,557,622,4,75,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,6-Oct,2005,437,7060,,,,,889,893,,10.1038/nature04230,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,970VB,WOS:000232338600047,16208372,No,,,11/20/17

We show that initially, only a small population of cells ( including both quiescent neural stem cells and transit-amplifying cells) responds to Shh in regions undergoing neurogenesis. This population subsequently expands markedly to continuously provide new neurons in the forebrain. Our study of the behaviour of quiescent neural stem cells provides in vivo evidence that they can self-renew for over a year and generate multiple cell types.

The vomeronasal organ, located at the base of the nasal septum, is responsible for mediating pheromone information in mice(3-9). Two classes of putative pheromone receptor gene families, V1R and V2R, are expressed by vomeronasal sensory neurons in mutually segregated epithelial zones of the vomeronasal organ(10-14). Although numerous studies have suggested that pheromones originate from urine(15-18), direct recordings of behaving mice have shown that neuronal firing in the vomeronasal system is modulated by physical contact with the facial area(19). Here we identify a male-specific 7-kDa peptide secreted from the extraorbital lacrimal gland. This peptide, which we named exocrine gland-secreting peptide 1 (ESP1), is encoded by a gene from a previously unrecognized large family clustered in proximity to the class I major histocompatibility complex (MHC) region. ESP1 is secreted from the eyes and is transferred to the female vomeronasal organ, where it stimulates V2R-expressing vomeronasal sensory neurons and elicits an electrical response. Our results indicate that mice respond to sex-specific peptides released from exocrine glands through the vomeronasal system during direct contact.","Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Frontier Sci, Dept Integrated Biosci, Chiba 2778562, Japan","Touhara, K (reprint author), Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Frontier Sci, Dept Integrated Biosci, Chiba 2778562, Japan.",touhara@k.u-tokyo.ac.jp,,,,,,29,216,226,0,22,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,6-Oct,2005,437,7060,,,,,898,901,,10.1038/nature04033,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,970VB,WOS:000232338600049,16208374,No,,,11/20/17

The molecular identity and the gating mechanism of SOC and CRAC channels have remained elusive. Previously we identified Stim and the mammalian homologue STIM1 as essential components of CRAC channel activation in Drosophila S2 cells and human T lymphocytes(11). Here we show that the expression of EF-hand mutants of Stim or STIM1 activates CRAC channels constitutively without changing Ca2+ store content. By immunofluorescence, EM localization and surface biotinylation we show that STIM1 migrates from endoplasmic-reticulum-like sites to the plasma membrane upon depletion of the Ca2+ store. We propose that STIM1 functions as the missing link between Ca2+ store depletion and SOC influx, serving as a Ca2+ sensor that translocates upon store depletion to the plasma membrane to activate CRAC channels.","Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Physiol & Biophys, Irvine, CA 92697 USA; Univ Calif Irvine, Ctr Immunol, Irvine, CA 92697 USA; TorreyPines Therapeut Inc, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Neurosci, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; Univ Calif San Diego, Natl Ctr Microscopy & Imaging Res, Ctr Res Biol Struct, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA","Cahalan, MD (reprint author), Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Physiol & Biophys, Irvine, CA 92697 USA.",mcahalan@uci.edu,,,"NCI NIH HHS [P30 CA062203]; NINDS NIH HHS [R01 NS014609, R37 NS014609]",,,25,785,821,2,46,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,6-Oct,2005,437,7060,,,,,902,905,,10.1038/nature04147,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,970VB,WOS:000232338600050,16208375,No,,,11/20/17

In contrast to the MHC system, CD1 molecules bind lipid antigens that are presented at the antigen-presenting cell (APC) surface to lipid antigen-reactive T cells(1). Because CD1 molecules survey endocytic compartments(2), it is self-evident that they encounter antigens from extracellular sources. However, the mechanisms of exogenous lipid antigen delivery to CD1-antigen-loading compartments are not known. Serum apolipoproteins are mediators of extracellular lipid transport for metabolic needs(3). Here we define the pathways mediating markedly efficient exogenous lipid antigen delivery by apolipoproteins to achieve T-cell activation. Apolipoprotein E binds lipid antigens and delivers them by receptor-mediated uptake into endosomal compartments containing CD1 in APCs. Apolipoprotein E mediates the presentation of serum-borne lipid antigens and can be secreted by APCs as a mechanism to survey the local environment to capture antigens or to transfer microbial lipids from infected cells to bystander APCs. Thus, the immune system has co-opted a component of lipid metabolism to develop immunological responses to lipid antigens.","Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Pathol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Med, Div Rheumatol Allergy & Immunol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Brigham & Womens Hosp, Ctr Neurol Dis, Boston, MA 02115 USA; Harvard Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Nutr, Boston, MA 02115 USA; Univ Birmingham, Sch Biosci, Birmingham B15 2TT, W Midlands, England","Brenner, MB (reprint author), Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Pathol, Boston, MA 02115 USA.",mbrenner@rics.bwh.harvard.edu,,"Besra, Gurdyal/0000-0002-5605-0395",NHLBI NIH HHS [R01 HL071590]; NIGMS NIH HHS [T32 GM007753]; Wellcome Trust,,,29,223,226,2,17,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,6-Oct,2005,437,7060,,,,,906,910,,10.1038/nature04001,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,970VB,WOS:000232338600051,16208376,No,,,11/20/17

Furthermore, InvC induces chaperone release from and unfolding of the cognate secreted protein in an ATP-dependent manner.

Here we use 13 models of the ocean - carbon cycle to assess calcium carbonate saturation under the IS92a 'business-as-usual' scenario for future emissions of anthropogenic carbon dioxide. In our projections, Southern Ocean surface waters will begin to become undersaturated with respect to aragonite, a metastable form of calcium carbonate, by the year 2050. By 2100, this undersaturation could extend throughout the entire Southern Ocean and into the subarctic Pacific Ocean.

The supply of nutrients to the sunlit surface layer of the ocean has traditionally been attributed solely to vertical processes. However, horizontal advection may also be important in establishing the availability of nutrients. Here we show that the production and advection of North Atlantic Subtropical Mode Water introduces spatial and temporal variability in the subsurface nutrient reservoir beneath the North Atlantic subtropical gyre. As the mode water is formed, its nutrients are depleted by biological utilization. When the depleted water mass is exported to the gyre, it injects a wedge of low-nutrient water into the upper layers of the ocean. Contrary to intuition, cold winters that promote deep convective mixing and vigorous mode water formation may diminish downstream primary productivity by altering the subsurface delivery of nutrients.","Duke Univ, Nicholas Sch Environm & Earth Sci, Div Earth & Ocean Sci, Durham, NC 27708 USA; Duke Univ, Marine Lab, Nicholas Sch Environm & Earth Sci, Div Coastal Syst Sci & Policy, Beaufort, NC 28516 USA","Palter, JB (reprint author), Duke Univ, Nicholas Sch Environm & Earth Sci, Div Earth & Ocean Sci, Durham, NC 27708 USA.",jbp3@duke.edu,"Palter, Jaime/B-9484-2011",,,,,32,97,97,1,23,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,29-Sep,2005,437,7059,,,,,687,692,,10.1038/nature03969,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,968JD,WOS:000232157900043,16193044,No,,,11/20/17

It has been postulated that plants have both membrane-bound and soluble GA receptors; however, no GA receptors have yet been identified. Here we report the isolation and characterization of a new GA-insensitive dwarf mutant of rice, gid1. The GID1 gene encodes an unknown protein with similarity to the hormone-sensitive lipases, and we observed preferential localization of a GID1 - green fluorescent protein (GFP) signal in nuclei. Recombinant glutathione S-transferase (GST) - GID1 had a high affinity only for biologically active GAs, whereas mutated GST - GID1 corresponding to three gid1 alleles had no GA-binding affinity. The dissociation constant for GA(4) was estimated to be around 10(-7) M, enough to account for the GA dependency of shoot elongation. Moreover, GID1 bound to SLR1, a rice DELLA protein, in a GA-dependent manner in yeast cells. GID1 overexpression resulted in a GA-hypersensitive phenotype.

We dissected and measured sources of variation in system output, analysing thousands of individual, genetically identical cells. Only a small proportion of total cell-to-cell variation is caused by random fluctuations in gene transcription and translation during the response ('expression noise'). Instead, variation is dominated by differences in the capacity of individual cells to transmit signals through the pathway ('pathway capacity') and to express proteins from genes ('expression capacity'). Cells with high expression capacity express proteins at a higher rate and increase in volume more rapidly. Our results identify two mechanisms that regulate cell-to-cell variation in pathway capacity. First, the MAP kinase Fus3 suppresses variation at high pheromone levels, while the MAP kinase Kss1 enhances variation at low pheromone levels. Second, pathway capacity and expression capacity are negatively correlated, suggesting a compensatory mechanism that allows cells to respond more precisely to pheromone in the presence of a large variation in expression capacity.","Inst Mol Sci, Berkeley, CA 94704 USA; MIT, Div Biol Engn, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA","Gordon, A (reprint author), Inst Mol Sci, 2168 Shattuck Ave, Berkeley, CA 94704 USA.",gordon@molsci.org; brent@molsci.org,"Serra, Eduard/K-1332-2013","Serra, Eduard/0000-0003-2895-9857; Endy, Drew/0000-0001-6952-8098; Colman-Lerner, Alejandro A/0000-0002-2557-8883",,,,38,261,266,1,20,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,29-Sep,2005,437,7059,,,,,699,706,,10.1038/nature03998,,8,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,968JD,WOS:000232157900045,16170311,No,,,11/20/17

In particular, all galaxies are believed to be embedded in massive haloes of dark matter(1,2). This view has recently been challenged by the observation of surprisingly low random stellar velocities in the outskirts of ordinary elliptical galaxies, which has been interpreted as indicating a lack of dark matter(3,4). Here we show that the low velocities are in fact compatible with galaxy formation in dark-matter haloes. Using numerical simulations of disk-galaxy mergers(5,6), we find that the stellar orbits in the outer regions of the resulting ellipticals are very elongated. These stars were torn by tidal forces from their original galaxies during the first close passage and put on outgoing trajectories. The elongated orbits, combined with the steeply falling density profile of the observed tracers, explain the observed low velocities even in the presence of large amounts of dark matter. Projection effects when viewing a triaxial elliptical can lead to even lower observed velocities along certain lines of sight.","Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Racah Inst Phys, IL-91904 Jerusalem, Israel; Inst Astrophys, F-75014 Paris, France; Observ Paris, F-92195 Meudon, France; Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Univ Calif Observ, Lick Observ, Dept Phys, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA; Harvard Univ, Ctr Astrophys, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA","Dekel, A (reprint author), Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Racah Inst Phys, IL-91904 Jerusalem, Israel.",dekel@phys.huji.ac.il,,"Mamon, Gary/0000-0001-8956-5953",,,,30,138,139,0,4,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,29-Sep,2005,437,7059,,,,,707,710,,10.1038/nature03970,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,968JD,WOS:000232157900046,16193046,No,,,11/20/17

Hence, the molecular photoemission can be regarded as a natural double-slit experiment(1): coherent electron emission originates from two identical sites, and should give rise to characteristic interference patterns(2). However, the quantum coherence is obscured if the two possible symmetry states of the electronic wavefunction ('gerade' and 'ungerade') are degenerate; the sum of the two exactly resembles the distinguishable, incoherent emission from two localized core sites. Here we observe the coherence of core electrons in N-2 through a direct measurement of the interference exhibited in their emission.

Because of the long timescale involved, however, the underlying dynamic processes responsible for the evolution of dune fields remain poorly understood(8). Here we combine data from a three-year field study in the Moroccan Sahara with a model study to show that barchans are fundamentally unstable and do not necessarily behave like stable solitary waves, as suggested previously(9-12). We find that dune collisions and changes in wind direction destabilize the dunes and generate surface waves on the barchans. Because the resulting surface waves propagate at a higher speed than the dunes themselves, they can produce a series of new barchans of elementary size by breaking the horns of large dunes. The creation of these new dunes provides a mechanism for sand loss that prevents dune fields from merging into a single giant dune and therefore plays a fundamental role in the control of size selection and the development of dune patterns.","Phys & Mecan Milieux Heterogenes Lab, CNRS, UMR 7636, F-75005 Paris, France; Univ Ibn Zohr, Dept Geol, Agadir 80000, Morocco","Andreotti, B (reprint author), Phys & Mecan Milieux Heterogenes Lab, CNRS, UMR 7636, 10 Rue Vauquelin, F-75005 Paris, France.",andreotti@pmmh.espci.fr,,,,,,18,102,113,2,22,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,29-Sep,2005,437,7059,,,,,720,723,,10.1038/nature04058,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,968JD,WOS:000232157900049,16193049,No,,,11/20/17

Here we report direct LA-ICPMS measurements of the composition of fluids and melts equilibrated with a basaltic eclogite at pressures equivalent to depths in the Earth of 120 - 180 km and temperatures of 700 - 1,200 degrees C. The resultant liquid/mineral partition coefficients constrain the recycling rates of key elements. The dichotomy of dehydration versus melting at 120 km depth is expressed through contrasting behaviour of many trace elements (U/Th, Sr, Ba, Be and the light rare-earth elements). At pressures equivalent to 180 km depth, however, a supercritical liquid with melt-like solubilities for the investigated trace elements is observed, even at low temperatures. This mobilizes most of the key trace elements ( except the heavy rare-earth elements, Y and Sc) and thus limits fluid-phase transfer of geochemical signatures in subduction zones to pressures less than 6 GPa.","Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Inst Earth Sci, IL-91904 Jerusalem, Israel; ETH Zentrum, Inst Mineral & Petrog, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland","Kessel, R (reprint author), Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Inst Earth Sci, IL-91904 Jerusalem, Israel.",kessel@vms.huji.ac.il,"Schmidt, Max/A-1676-2008; Kessel, Ronit/A-3885-2017",,,,,32,544,570,13,139,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,29-Sep,2005,437,7059,,,,,724,727,,10.1038/nature03971,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,968JD,WOS:000232157900050,16193050,No,,,11/20/17

Diatom growth depends on silicate availability, in addition to nitrate and phosphate(2,3), but northern Atlantic waters are richer in nitrate than silicate(4). Following the spring stratification, diatoms are the first phytoplankton to bloom(2,5). Once silicate is exhausted, diatom blooms subside in a major export event(6,7). Here we show that, with nitrate still available for new production, the diatom bloom is prolonged where there is a periodic supply of new silicate: specifically, diatoms thrive by 'mining' deep-water silicate brought to the surface by an unstable ocean front.

To pass from the water surface to land, they must contend with the slippery slopes of the menisci that border the water's edge. The ability to climb menisci is a skill exploited by water-walking insects as they seek land in order to lay eggs or avoid predators(4); moreover, it was a necessary adaptation for their ancestors as they evolved from terrestrials to live exclusively on the water surface(3). Many millimetre-scale water-walking insects are unable to climb menisci using their traditional means of propulsion(2,3,9). Through a combined experimental and theoretical study, here we investigate the meniscus-climbing technique that such insects use. By assuming a fixed body posture, they deform the water surface in order to generate capillary forces(10-13): they thus propel themselves laterally without moving their appendages.

Here we show that experimentally introduced technologies will spread within different ape communities.

How the endogenous brassinosteroids change in response to environmental stimuli is largely unknown. Ca2+/calmodulin has an essential role in sensing and transducing environmental stimuli(4,5). Arabidopsis DWARF1 (DWF1) is responsible for an early step in brassinosteroid biosynthesis that converts 24-methylenecholesterol to campesterol(6,7). Here we show that DWF1 is a Ca2+/calmodulin-binding protein and this binding is critical for its function. Molecular genetic analysis using site-directed and deletion mutants revealed that loss of calmodulin binding completely abolished the function of DWF1 in planta, whereas partial loss of calmodulin binding resulted in a partial dwarf phenotype in complementation studies. These results provide direct proof that Ca2+/calmodulin-mediated signalling has a critical role in controlling the function of DWF1. Furthermore, we observed that DWF1 orthologues from other plants have a similar Ca2+/calmodulin-binding domain, implying that Ca2+/calmodulin regulation of DWF1 and its homologues is common in plants. These results raise the possibility of producing size-engineered crops by altering the Ca2+/calmodulin-binding property of their DWF1 orthologues.","Washington State Univ, Ctr Integrated Biotechnol, Pullman, WA 99164 USA; Washington State Univ, Dept Hort, Pullman, WA 99164 USA","Poovaiah, BW (reprint author), Washington State Univ, Ctr Integrated Biotechnol, Pullman, WA 99164 USA.",poovaiah@wsu.edu,,,,,,29,78,92,3,21,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,29-Sep,2005,437,7059,,,,,741,745,,10.1038/nature03973,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,968JD,WOS:000232157900054,16193053,No,,,11/20/17

Studies in Drosophila melanogaster have proved fruitful in determining the signals used to control NF-kappa B proteins, beginning with the discovery that the Toll/NF-kappa B pathway, in addition to patterning the dorsal - ventral axis of the fly embryo, defines a major component of the innate immune response in both Drosophila and mammals(2,3). Here, we characterize the Drosophila wntD (Wnt inhibitor of Dorsal) gene. We show that WntD acts as a feedback inhibitor of the NF-kappa B homologue Dorsal during both embryonic patterning and the innate immune response to infection. wntD expression is under the control of Toll/Dorsal signalling, and increased levels of WntD block Dorsal nuclear accumulation, even in the absence of the I kappa B homologue Cactus. The WntD signal is independent of the common Wnt signalling component Armadillo (beta-catenin). By engineering a gene knockout, we show that wntD loss-of-function mutants have immune defects and exhibit increased levels of Toll/Dorsal signalling. Furthermore, the wntD mutant phenotype is suppressed by loss of zygotic dorsal. These results describe the first secreted feedback antagonist of Toll signalling, and demonstrate a novel Wnt activity in the fly.","Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Beckman Ctr, Howard Hughes Med Inst,Dept Dev Biol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Dept Microbiol & Immunol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA","Nusse, R (reprint author), Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Beckman Ctr, Howard Hughes Med Inst,Dept Dev Biol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",rnusse@stanford.edu,"Gordon, Michael/H-9586-2012; Dionne, Marc/J-2572-2013","Gordon, Michael/0000-0002-5440-986X; Dionne, Marc/0000-0002-8283-1750",NIAID NIH HHS [R01 AI053080],,,30,96,103,0,13,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,29-Sep,2005,437,7059,,,,,746,749,,10.1038/nature04073,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,968JD,WOS:000232157900055,16107793,No,,,11/20/17

Most quorum-sensing autoinducers promote intraspecies communication, but one autoinducer, called AI-2, is produced and detected by a wide variety of bacteria and is proposed to allow interspecies communication(1,2). Here we show that some species of bacteria can manipulate AI-2 signalling and interfere with other species' ability to assess and respond correctly to changes in cell population density. AI-2 signalling, and the interference with it, could have important ramifications for eukaryotes in the maintenance of normal microflora and in protection from pathogenic bacteria.","Princeton Univ, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Dept Mol Biol, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA","Bassler, BL (reprint author), Princeton Univ, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Dept Mol Biol, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA.",bbassler@molbio.princeton.edu,"Xavier, Karina/B-9425-2008","Xavier, Karina/0000-0001-5210-1434",NIGMS NIH HHS [R01 GM065859],,,19,153,164,0,47,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,29-Sep,2005,437,7059,,,,,750,753,,10.1038/nature03960,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,968JD,WOS:000232157900056,16193054,No,,,11/20/17

Here we show that the nuclei are engulfed by macrophages only after they are disconnected from reticulocytes, and that phosphatidylserine, which is often used as an 'eat me' signal for apoptotic cells, is also used for the engulfment of nuclei expelled from erythroblasts. We investigated the mechanism behind the enucleation and engulfment processes by isolating late-stage erythroblasts from the spleens of phlebotomized mice. When these erythroblasts were cultured, the nuclei protruded spontaneously from the erythroblasts. A weak physical force could disconnect the nuclei from the reticulocytes. The released nuclei contained an undetectable level of ATP, and quickly exposed phosphatidylserine on their surface.

Although the ability of PPAR-gamma agonists to antagonize inflammatory responses by transrepression of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappa B) target genes is linked to antidiabetic(4) and antiatherogenic actions(5), the mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here we report the identification of a molecular pathway by which PPAR-gamma represses the transcriptional activation of inflammatory response genes in mouse macrophages. The initial step of this pathway involves ligand-dependent SUMOylation of the PPAR-gamma ligand-binding domain, which targets PPAR-gamma to nuclear receptor corepressor (NCoR)-histone deacetylase-3 (HDAC3) complexes on inflammatory gene promoters. This in turn prevents recruitment of the ubiquitylation/19S proteosome machinery that normally mediates the signal-dependent removal of corepressor complexes required for gene activation. As a result, NCoR complexes are not cleared from the promoter and target genes are maintained in a repressed state. This mechanism provides an explanation for how an agonist-bound nuclear receptor can be converted from an activator of transcription to a promoter-specific repressor of NF-kappa B target genes that regulate immunity and homeostasis.","Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Cellular & Mol Med, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; Univ Calif San Diego, Howard Hughes Med Inst, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Med, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; Univ Calif San Diego, Biomed Sci Grad Program, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; GlaxoSmithKline Inc, Res Triangle Pk, NC 27709 USA","Glass, CK (reprint author), Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Cellular & Mol Med, 9500 Gilman Dr, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.",cglass@ucsd.edu,,"Perissi, Valentina/0000-0002-3716-0003","NCI NIH HHS [R01 CA052599]; NIDDK NIH HHS [R01 DK091183, R37 DK039949]",,,30,757,789,1,36,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,29-Sep,2005,437,7059,,,,,759,763,,10.1038/nature03988,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,968JD,WOS:000232157900058,16127449,No,,,11/20/17

In establishing infection these icosahedral viruses undergo endosomal membrane fusion catalysed by envelope glycoprotein rearrangement of the putative receptor-binding domain III (DIII) and exposure of the hydrophobic fusion loop(2-4). Humoral immunity has an essential protective function early in the course of West Nile virus infection(5,6). Here, we investigate the mechanism of neutralization by the E16 monoclonal antibody that specifically binds DIII. Structurally, the E16 antibody Fab fragment engages 16 residues positioned on four loops of DIII, a consensus neutralizing epitope sequence conserved in West Nile virus and distinct in other flaviviruses. The E16 epitope protrudes from the surface of mature virions in three distinct environments(7), and docking studies predict Fab binding will leave fivefold clustered epitopes exposed. We also show that E16 inhibits infection primarily at a step after viral attachment, potentially by blocking envelope glycoprotein conformational changes. Collectively, our results suggest that a vaccine strategy targeting the dominant DIII epitope may elicit safe and effective immune responses against flaviviral diseases.","Washington Univ, Sch Med, Dept Pathol & Immunol, St Louis, MO 63110 USA; Washington Univ, Sch Med, Dept Mol Microbiol, St Louis, MO 63110 USA; Washington Univ, Sch Med, Dept Biochem & Mol Biophys, St Louis, MO 63110 USA; Washington Univ, Sch Med, Dept Med, St Louis, MO 63110 USA; MacroGenics, Rockville, MD 20850 USA","Fremont, DH (reprint author), Washington Univ, Sch Med, Dept Pathol & Immunol, St Louis, MO 63110 USA.",Fremont@wustl.edu,,,,,,30,213,230,0,13,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,29-Sep,2005,437,7059,,,,,764,768,,10.1038/nature03956,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,968JD,WOS:000232157900059,16193056,No,,,11/20/17

Pathogenic microorganisms have apparently evolved defence mechanisms that counteract the effects of NO and related reactive nitrogen species. Regulatory proteins that sense NO mediate the primary response to NO and nitrosative stress(3-9). The only regulatory protein in enteric bacteria known to serve exclusively as an NO-responsive transcription factor is the enhancer binding protein NorR (refs 9 - 11). In Escherichia coli, NorR activates the transcription of the nor VW genes encoding a flavorubredoxin (FlRd) and an associated flavoprotein, respectively, which together have NADH-dependent NO reductase activity(10,12-14). The NO-responsive activity of NorR raises important questions concerning the mechanism of NO sensing. Here we show that the regulatory domain of NorR contains a mononuclear non-haem iron centre, which reversibly binds NO. Binding of NO stimulates the ATPase activity of NorR, enabling the activation of transcription by RNA polymerase. The mechanism of NorR reveals an unprecedented biological role for a non-haem mononitrosyl - iron complex in NO sensing.","John Innes Ctr Plant Sci Res, Norwich NR4 7UH, Norfolk, England; Georgia Inst Technol, Sch Biol, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA","Spiro, S (reprint author), John Innes Ctr Plant Sci Res, Norwich NR4 7UH, Norfolk, England.",stephen.spiro@biology.gatech.edu,"Spiro, Stephen/B-1838-2009","Spiro, Stephen/0000-0001-5975-9984",,,,30,160,161,1,26,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,29-Sep,2005,437,7059,,,,,769,772,,10.1038/nature03953,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,968JD,WOS:000232157900060,16193057,No,,,11/20/17

Here we report the results of a flux- limited I- band survey of galaxies at look- back times of 9 to 12 billion years. We find 970 galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts between 1.4 and 5.

As a consequence, the cosmic star formation rate representing the volume- averaged production of stars is higher than previously measured at redshifts of 3 to 4.","Univ Aix Marseille 1, CNRS, UMR 6110, OAMP,Lab Astrophys Marseille, F-13376 Marseille, France; Max Planck Inst Astrophys, D-85741 Garching, Germany; Inst Astrophys, UMR 7095, F-75014 Paris, France; IASF INAF, I-20133 Milan, Italy; Univ Bologna, Dipartimento Astron, I-40127 Bologna, Italy; Osservatorio Astron Bologna, INAF, I-40127 Bologna, Italy; Observ Midi Pyrenees, UMR 5572, Astrophys Lab, F-31400 Toulouse, France; IRA INAF, I-40129 Bologna, Italy; European So Observ, D-85748 Garching, Germany; Osserv Astron Brera, INAF, Milan, Italy; Osserv Astron Capodimonte, INAF, I-80131 Naples, Italy; Observ Paris, LERMA, F-75014 Paris, France","Le Fevre, O (reprint author), Univ Aix Marseille 1, CNRS, UMR 6110, OAMP,Lab Astrophys Marseille, BP8, F-13376 Marseille, France.",Olivier.LeFevre@oamp.fr,"Pello, Roser/G-4754-2010; Le Fevre, Olivier/G-7389-2011; Merighi, Roberto/O-9360-2015; Cappi, Alberto/O-9391-2015; Zucca, Elena/O-9396-2015; Bolzonella, Micol/O-9495-2015; Bardelli, Sandro/O-9369-2015; Guzzo, Luigi/R-4939-2017","Pozzetti, Lucia/0000-0001-7085-0412; Ciliegi, Paolo/0000-0002-0447-4620; Merighi, Roberto/0000-0003-2490-1834; Cappi, Alberto/0000-0002-9200-7167; Zucca, Elena/0000-0002-5845-8132; Bolzonella, Micol/0000-0003-3278-4607; Bardelli, Sandro/0000-0002-8900-0298; Iovino, Angela/0000-0001-6958-0304; bottini, dario/0000-0001-6917-041X; Franzetti, Paolo/0000-0002-6986-0127; Scaramella, Roberto/0000-0003-2229-193X; Arnaboldi, Magda/0000-0001-7214-3009; Zanichelli, Alessandra/0000-0002-2893-023X; Busarello, Giovanni/0000-0002-4253-7100; Radovich, Mario/0000-0002-3585-866X; Garilli, Bianca/0000-0001-7455-8750; Zamorani, Giovanni/0000-0002-2318-301X; Bongiorno, Angela/0000-0002-0101-6624; Scodeggio, Marco/0000-0002-2282-5850; Merluzzi, Paola/0000-0003-3966-2397",,,,21,50,50,0,5,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,22-Sep,2005,437,7058,,,,,519,521,,10.1038/nature03979,,3,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,966FF,WOS:000232004800042,16177783,No,,,11/20/17

Materials and structures that exhibit nonlinear resistance of this sort are not only useful for practical applications: they also provide systems for exploring fundamental aspects of solid- state and statistical physics. Here we report the discovery of a giant nonlinear resistance effect in the conducting organic salt(2) theta- ( BEDT- TTF) 2CsCo( SCN)(4), the voltage- current characteristics of which are essentially the same as those of a conventional thyristor. This intrinsic organic thyristor works as an inverter, generating an alternating current when a static direct- current voltage is applied. Whereas conventional thyristors consist of a series of diodes ( their nonlinearity comes from interface effects at the p- n junctions), the present salt exhibits giant nonlinear resistance as a bulk phenomenon. We attribute the origin of this effect to the current-induced melting of insulating charge- order domains, an intrinsically non- equilibrium phenomenon in the sense that ordered domains are melted by a steady flow.","Waseda Univ, Dept Appl Phys, Tokyo 1698555, Japan; Inst Solid State Phys, Kashiwa, Chiba 2778581, Japan; Japan Sci & Technol Corp, CREST, Kawaguchi 3320012, Japan; Tokyo Inst Technol, Dept Organ & Polymer Mat, Tokyo 1528552, Japan; Tohoku Univ, Inst Multidisciplinary Res Adv Mat, Sendai, Miyagi 9808577, Japan; Japan Synchrotron Radiat Res Inst, Mikazuki, Hyogo 6795198, Japan; Okayama Univ, Grad Sch Nat Sci & Technol, Okayama 7008530, Japan","Terasaki, I (reprint author), Waseda Univ, Dept Appl Phys, Tokyo 1698555, Japan.",terra@waseda.jp,"NOGAMI, Yoshio/B-1502-2011; IKEDA, Naoshi/B-2587-2011; TERASAKI, Ichiro/I-7083-2014","TERASAKI, Ichiro/0000-0002-6073-2639; Watanabe, Masashi/0000-0002-8004-3208; Mori, Takehiko/0000-0002-0578-5885",,,,13,153,153,3,36,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,22-Sep,2005,437,7058,,,,,522,524,,10.1038/nature04087,,3,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,966FF,WOS:000232004800043,16177784,No,,,11/20/17

The phase exhibits the simultaneous presence of finite local- order parameters of helices and smectic layers, without any discontinuity on a mesoscopic length scale. The anomalous softening of elasticity due to a strong reduction in entropy caused by mixing the monomer and the twin permits the seamless coexistence of these two competing liquid crystal orders. The new phase spontaneously exhibits an optically isotropic but uniformly iridescent colour and automatically acquires spherical symmetry, so that the associated photonic band gap(6 - 9) maintains the same symmetry despite the local liquid crystalline order. We expect a range of unusual optical transmission properties based on this three-dimensional isotropic structure, and complete tunability due to the intrinsic softness and responsiveness of the liquid crystalline order against external fields.","ERATO, Yokoyama Nanostruct Liquid Crystal Project, JST, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3002635, Japan; AIST, Nanotechnol Res Inst, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058568, Japan","Yamamoto, J (reprint author), Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Sci, Dept Phys, Sakyo Ku, Kyoto 6068502, Japan.",jun@junyamamoto.jp,,,,,,17,36,36,0,31,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,22-Sep,2005,437,7058,,,,,525,528,,10.1038/nature04034,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,966FF,WOS:000232004800044,16177785,No,,,11/20/17

But although severe regional heatwaves may become more frequent in a changing climate(3,4), their impact on terrestrial carbon cycling is unclear. Here we report measurements of ecosystem carbon dioxide fluxes, remotely sensed radiation absorbed by plants, and country- level crop yields taken during the European heatwave in 2003. We use a terrestrial biosphere simulation model(5) to assess continental- scale changes in primary productivity during 2003, and their consequences for the net carbon balance. We estimate a 30 per cent reduction in gross primary productivity over Europe, which resulted in a strong anomalous net source of carbon dioxide ( 0.5 Pg Cyr(-1)) to the atmosphere and reversed the effect of four years of net ecosystem carbon sequestration(6). Our results suggest that productivity reduction in eastern and western Europe can be explained by rainfall deficit and extreme summer heat, respectively. We also find that ecosystem respiration decreased together with gross primary productivity, rather than accelerating with the temperature rise. Model results, corroborated by historical records of crop yields, suggest that such a reduction in Europe's primary productivity is unprecedented during the last century. An increase in future drought events could turn temperate ecosystems into carbon sources, contributing to positive carbon- climate feedbacks already anticipated in the tropics and at high latitudes(1,2).","Lab Sci Climat & Environm, F-91191 Gif Sur Yvette, France; Univ Tuscia, DISAFRI, Dept Forest Environm & Resources, I-01100 Viterbo, Italy; Potsdam Inst Climate Impact Res, D-14473 Potsdam, Germany; Ctr Nancy, F-54280 Champenoux, France; INRA, Ephyse, Funct Ecol & Environm Phys, F-33612 Villenave Dornon, France; INRA, Grassland Ecosyst Res, F-63039 Clermont Ferrand, France; ETH Zentrum, Inst Plant Sci, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland; Fac Sci Agron Etat Gembloux, B-5030 Gembloux, Belgium; Tech Univ Dresden, Dept Meteorol, Inst Hydrol & Meteorol, D-01062 Dresden, Germany; Fdn CEAM, E-46980 Valencia, Spain; Univ Helsinki, Dept Phys Sci, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland; Max Planck Inst Biogeochem, D-07701 Jena, Germany; Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Environm Sci Policy & Management, Ecosyst Sci Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; Lab Glaciol & Geophys Environm, F-38402 St Martin Dheres, France; Commiss European Communities, Joint Res Ctr, Inst Environm & Sustainabil, I-21020 Ispra, Italy; CNR, IBIMET, I-50144 Florence, Italy; CNRS, DREAM CEFE, F-34293 Montpellier, France; Riso Natl Lab, Biosyst Dept, DK-4000 Roskilde, Denmark","Ciais, P (reprint author), Lab Sci Climat & Environm, F-91191 Gif Sur Yvette, France.",philippe.ciais@cea.fr,"Seufert, Gunther/J-9918-2013; de NOBLET, Nathalie/O-8613-2015; Matteucci, Giorgio/N-3526-2015; Miglietta, Franco/B-6137-2008; Miglietta, Franco/A-1257-2009; Allard , Vincent/B-8806-2009; Buchmann, Nina/E-6095-2011; Valentini, Riccardo/D-1226-2010; Krinner, Gerhard/A-6450-2011; Ogee, Jerome/C-7185-2013; Pilegaard, Kim/I-7137-2013; Knohl, Alexander/F-9453-2014; Schulze, Ernst-Detlef/K-9627-2014; Carrara, Arnaud/L-8144-2014; Sanz Sanchez, Maria Jose/A-6099-2016; Chevallier, Frederic/E-9608-2016; Friedlingstein, Pierre/H-2700-2014; Soussana, Jean-Francois/P-2094-2016; Vesala, Timo/C-3795-2017; Reichstein, Markus/A-7494-2011; Soussana, Jean-Francois/M-2814-2017","Seufert, Gunther/0000-0002-6019-6688; Matteucci, Giorgio/0000-0002-4790-9540; Miglietta, Franco/0000-0003-1474-8143; Valentini, Riccardo/0000-0002-6756-5634; Krinner, Gerhard/0000-0002-2959-5920; Pilegaard, Kim/0000-0002-5169-5717; Knohl, Alexander/0000-0002-7615-8870; Sanz Sanchez, Maria Jose/0000-0003-0471-3094; Chevallier, Frederic/0000-0002-4327-3813; Soussana, Jean-Francois/0000-0002-1932-6583; Vesala, Timo/0000-0002-4852-7464; Reichstein, Markus/0000-0001-5736-1112; rambal, serge/0000-0001-5869-8382; Papale, Dario/0000-0001-5170-8648; Keronen, Petri/0000-0001-5019-0904",,,,28,1355,1433,53,766,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,22-Sep,2005,437,7058,,,,,529,533,,10.1038/nature03972,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,966FF,WOS:000232004800045,16177786,No,,,11/20/17

Such timescales can be assessed, however, with natural radioactive-decay- chain nuclides, because chemical disruption to secular equilibrium systems initiates parent - daughter disequilibria, which re- equilibrate by the shorter half- life in a pair. Here we use (210) Pb - (226) Ra - (230) Th radioactive disequilibria and other geochemical attributes in oceanic basalts less than 20 years old to infer that melts of the Earth's mantle can be transported, accumulated and erupted in a few decades. This implies that magmatic conditions can fluctuate rapidly at ridge volcanoes. (210) Pb deficits of up to 15 per cent relative to (226) Ra occur in normal mid- ocean ridge basalts, with the largest deficits in the most magnesium- rich lavas. The 22- year half- life of (210) Pb requires very recent fractionation of these two uranium- series nuclides. Relationships between (210) Pb- deficits, ( (226) Ra/ (230) Th) activity ratios and compatible trace- element ratios preclude crustal- magma differentiation or daughter- isotope degassing as the main causes for the signal. A mantle- melting model(2) can simulate observed disequilibria but preservation requires a subsequent mechanism to transport melt rapidly. The likelihood of magmatic disequilibria occurring before melt enters shallow crustal magma bodies also limits differentiation and heat replenishment timescales to decades at the localities studied.","Univ Hawaii, Hawaii Ctr Volcanol, Dept Geol & Geophys, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA","Rubin, KH (reprint author), Univ Hawaii, Hawaii Ctr Volcanol, Dept Geol & Geophys, 1680 East West Rd, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA.",krubin@hawaii.edu,"Rubin, Kenneth/B-3685-2008","Rubin, Kenneth/0000-0002-8554-1337",,,,30,83,84,0,11,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,22-Sep,2005,437,7058,,,,,534,538,,10.1038/nature03993,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,966FF,WOS:000232004800046,16177787,No,,,11/20/17

Statistically significant variations of b values have been measured in laboratory experiments, mines and various tectonic regimes such as subducting slabs, near magma chambers, along fault zones and in aftershock zones(3). However, it has remained uncertain whether these differences are due to differing stress regimes, as it was questionable that samples in small volumes ( such as in laboratory specimens, mines and the shallow Earth's crust) are representative of earthquakes in general. Given the lack of physical understanding of these differences, the observation that b values approach the constant 1 if large volumes are sampled(4) was interpreted to indicate that b = 1 is a universal constant for earthquakes in general(5). Here we show that the b value varies systematically for different styles of faulting. We find that normal faulting events have the highest b values, thrust events the lowest and strike- slip events intermediate values. Given that thrust faults tend to be under higher stress than normal faults we infer that the b value acts as a stress meter that depends inversely on differential stress.","Swiss Fed Inst Technol, ETH Honggerberg, Swiss Seismol Serv, CH-8093 Zurich, Switzerland; World Agcy Planetary Monitoring & Earthquake Risk, CH-1207 Geneva, Switzerland","Schorlemmer, D (reprint author), Swiss Fed Inst Technol, ETH Honggerberg, Swiss Seismol Serv, Schafmattstr 30, CH-8093 Zurich, Switzerland.",danijel@sed.ethz.ch,"Wiemer, Stefan/E-5033-2015","Wiemer, Stefan/0000-0002-4919-3283",,,,28,304,315,4,42,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,22-Sep,2005,437,7058,,,,,539,542,,10.1038/nature04094,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,966FF,WOS:000232004800047,16177788,No,,,11/20/17

The limited physiological diversity among cultivated Archaea suggested that these organisms were metabolically constrained to a few environmental niches. For instance, all Crenarchaeota that are currently cultivated are sulphur-metabolizing thermophiles(1). However, landmark studies using cultivation- independent methods uncovered vast numbers of Crenarchaeota in cold oxic ocean waters(2,3). Subsequent molecular surveys demonstrated the ubiquity of these low- temperature Crenarchaeota in aquatic and terrestrial environments(4). The numerical dominance of marine Crenarchaeota - estimated at 10(28) cells in the world's oceans(5) - suggests that they have a major role in global biogeochemical cycles. Indeed, isotopic analyses of marine crenarchaeal lipids suggest that these planktonic Archaea fix inorganic carbon(6). Here we report the isolation of a marine crenarchaeote that grows chemolithoautotrophically by aerobically oxidizing ammonia to nitrite - the first observation of nitrification in the Archaea. The autotrophic metabolism of this isolate, and its close phylogenetic relationship to environmental marine crenarchaeal sequences, suggests that nitrifying marine Crenarchaeota may be important to global carbon and nitrogen cycles.","Univ Washington, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; Woods Hole Oceanog Inst, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA","Stahl, DA (reprint author), Univ Washington, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.",dastahl@u.washington.edu,"de la Torre, Jose/H-2081-2012; Koenneke, Martin/E-6893-2013","Koenneke, Martin/0000-0001-6770-414X",,,,27,1334,1450,35,477,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,22-Sep,2005,437,7058,,,,,543,546,,10.1038/nature03911,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,966FF,WOS:000232004800048,16177789,No,,,11/20/17

This view is based on field surveys and controlled experiments showing that species richness correlates negatively with high productivity(1,2) and nitrogen enrichment(3). However, as the type of nutrient limitation has never been examined on a large geographical scale the causality of these relationships is uncertain. We investigated species richness in herbaceous terrestrial ecosystems, sampled along a transect through temperate Eurasia that represented a gradient of declining levels of atmospheric nitrogen deposition - from similar to 50 kg ha(-1) yr(-1) in western Europe to natural background values of less than 5 kg ha(-1) yr(-1) in Siberia(4). Here we show that many more endangered plant species persist under phosphorus- limited than under nitrogen- limited conditions, and we conclude that enhanced phosphorus is more likely to be the cause of species loss than nitrogen enrichment.

The orexins ( or hypocretins) are neuropeptides recently identified as neurotransmitters in lateral hypothalamus neurons(5,6). Although knockout and transgenic overexpression studies have implicated orexin neurons in arousal and sleep(7), these cells also project to reward- associated brain regions, including the nucleus accumbens and ventral tegmental area(8,9). This indicates a possible role for these neurons in reward function and motivation(3,10), consistent with previous studies implicating these neurons in feeding(6). Here we show that activation of lateral hypothalamus orexin neurons is strongly linked to preferences for cues associated with drug and food reward. In addition, we show that chemical activation of lateral hypothalamus orexin neurons reinstates an extinguished drug- seeking behaviour. This reinstatement effect was completely blocked by prior administration of an orexin A antagonist. Moreover, administration of the orexin A peptide directly into the ventral tegmental area also reinstated drug- seeking. These data reveal a new role for lateral hypothalamus orexin neurons in reward- seeking, drug relapse and addiction.","Univ Penn, Dept Psychiat, Lab Neuromodulat & Behav, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA","Harris, GC (reprint author), Univ Penn, Dept Psychiat, Lab Neuromodulat & Behav, 705 Stellar Chance 6100,422 Curie Blvd, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",glenda@dolphin.upenn.edu,,,,,,31,696,710,1,44,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,22-Sep,2005,437,7058,,,,,556,559,,10.1038/nature04071,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,966FF,WOS:000232004800051,16100511,No,,,11/20/17

Decapentaplegic ( Dpp), a member of the transforming growth factor-beta ( TGF-beta) superfamily, embodies the activity of the A/ P organizer. It is produced at the A/ P organizer and distributes in a gradient of decreasing concentration to regulate target genes, functioning non- autonomously to regulate growth and patterning of both the anterior and posterior compartments(1 - 3). Wingless ( Wg) is produced at the D/ V organizer and embodies its activity(4,5). The mechanisms that distribute Dpp and Wg are not known, but proposed mechanisms include extracellular diffusion(6), successive transfers between neighbouring cells(7,8), vesicle- mediated movement(9), and direct transfer via cytonemes(10). Cytonemes are actin-based filopodial extensions that have been found to orient towards the A/ P organizer from outlying cells. Here we show that in the wing disc, cytonemes orient towards both the A/ P and D/ V organizers, and that their presence and orientation correlates with Dpp signalling. We also show that the Dpp receptor, Thickveins ( Tkv), is present in punctae that move along cytonemes. These observations are consistent with a role for cytonemes in signal transduction.","Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Biochem & Biophys, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA","Kornberg, TB (reprint author), Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Biochem & Biophys, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA.",tkornberg@biochem.ucsf.edu,,,,,,24,117,119,0,8,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,22-Sep,2005,437,7058,,,,,560,563,,10.1038/nature03951,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,966FF,WOS:000232004800052,16177792,No,,,11/20/17

Both Zmpste24- and Lmna- deficient mice exhibit profound nuclear architecture abnormalities and multiple histopathological defects that phenocopy an accelerated ageing process(1,2,4,5). Similarly, diverse human progeroid syndromes are caused by mutations in ZMPSTE24 or LMNA genes(6 - 10). To elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying these devastating diseases, we have analysed the transcriptional alterations occurring in tissues from Zmpste24- deficient mice. We demonstrate that Zmpste24 deficiency elicits a stress signalling pathway that is evidenced by a marked upregulation of p53 target genes, and accompanied by a senescence phenotype at the cellular level and accelerated ageing at the organismal level. These phenotypes are largely rescued in Zmpste24 (-/-) Lmna (+/-) mice and partially reversed in Zmpste24 (-/-) p53 (-/-) mice. These findings provide evidence for the existence of a checkpoint response activated by the nuclear abnormalities caused by prelamin A accumulation, and support the concept that hyperactivation of the tumour suppressor p53 may cause accelerated ageing(11).","Inst Univ Oncol, Fac Med, Dept Bioquim & Biol Mol, Oviedo, Spain; Univ Oviedo, Dept Morfol & Biol Celular, E-33006 Oviedo, Spain; Karolinska Inst, Dept Biochem & Biophys, Div Matrix Biol, S-17177 Stockholm, Sweden; NCI, Frederick, MD 21702 USA","Lopez-Otin, C (reprint author), Inst Univ Oncol, Fac Med, Dept Bioquim & Biol Mol, Oviedo, Spain.",clo@uniovi.es,"; Freije, Jose M.P./A-6535-2008; zhou, zhongjun/D-4818-2012; Pendas, Alberto/L-1017-2014; Varela, Ignacio/G-1699-2016; Lopez-Otin, Carlos/C-6657-2013; Folgueras, Alicia/B-3281-2017","Pendas, Alberto M/0000-0001-9264-3721; Freije, Jose M.P./0000-0002-4688-8266; Varela, Ignacio/0000-0002-0969-506X; Lopez-Otin, Carlos/0000-0001-6964-1904; Folgueras, Alicia/0000-0003-3426-9502; Gutierrez-Fernandez, Ana/0000-0002-9287-8843",,,,30,256,270,0,14,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,22-Sep,2005,437,7058,,,,,564,568,,10.1038/nature04019,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,966FF,WOS:000232004800053,16079796,No,,,11/20/17

These scaffold proteins may themselves be modulated by hormones(2 - 4). In adipocytes, stimulation of beta- adrenergic receptors increases cyclic AMP levels and activates protein kinase A ( PKA)(5), which stimulates lipolysis by phosphorylating hormone- sensitive lipase and perilipin(6 - 8). Acute insulin treatment activates phosphodiesterase 3B, reduces cAMP levels and quenches beta- adrenergic receptor signalling(9). In contrast, chronic hyperinsulinaemic conditions ( typical of type 2 diabetes) enhance beta- adrenergic receptor- mediated cAMP production(10). This amplification of cAMP signalling is paradoxical because it should enhance lipolysis, the opposite of the known short- term effect of hyperinsulinaemia. Here we show that in adipocytes, chronically high insulin levels inhibit beta- adrenergic receptors ( but not other cAMP- elevating stimuli) from activating PKA. We measured this using an improved fluorescent reporter and by phosphorylation of endogenous cAMP- response- element binding protein ( CREB). Disruption of PKA scaffolding mimics the interference of insulin with beta- adrenergic receptor signalling. Chronically high insulin levels may disrupt the close apposition of beta- adrenergic receptors and PKA, identifying a new mechanism for crosstalk between heterologous signal transduction pathways.","Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Pharmacol, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; Univ Calif San Diego, Div Endocrinol & Metab, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Chem & Biochem, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; Univ Calif San Diego, Howard Hughes Med Inst, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA","Tsien, RY (reprint author), Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Pharmacol, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.",rtsien@ucsd.edu,,,,,,26,191,201,3,10,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,22-Sep,2005,437,7058,,,,,569,573,,10.1038/nature04140,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,966FF,WOS:000232004800054,16177793,No,,,11/20/17

It acts principally through stimulation of cAMP- dependent protein kinases ( PKAs)(1,2) but also activates certain ion channels and guanine nucleotide exchange factors ( Epacs)(3). Metabolism of cAMP is catalysed by phosphodiesterases ( PDEs) (4,5). Here we identify a cAMP- responsive signalling complex maintained by the muscle-specific A- kinase anchoring protein ( mAKAP) that includes PKA, PDE4D3 and Epac1. These intermolecular interactions facilitate the dissemination of distinct cAMP signals through each effector protein. Anchored PKA stimulates PDE4D3 to reduce local cAMP concentrations, whereas an mAKAP- associated ERK5 kinase module suppresses PDE4D3. PDE4D3 also functions as an adaptor protein that recruits Epac1, an exchange factor for the small GTPase Rap1, to enable cAMP- dependent attenuation of ERK5. Pharmacological and molecular manipulations of the mAKAP complex show that anchored ERK5 can induce cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. Thus, two coupled cAMP- dependent feedback loops are coordinated within the context of the mAKAP complex, suggesting that local control of cAMP signalling by AKAP proteins is more intricate than previously appreciated.","Oregon Hlth & Sci Univ, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Vollum Inst, Portland, OR 97239 USA; Oregon Hlth & Sci Univ, Dept Pediat, Portland, OR 97239 USA","Scott, JD (reprint author), Oregon Hlth & Sci Univ, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Vollum Inst, Portland, OR 97239 USA.",scott@ohsu.edu,,"Kapiloff, Michael/0000-0002-7005-6953","NHLBI NIH HHS [R01 HL075398, R01 HL075398-02, R01 HL088366]; NIDDK NIH HHS [P01 DK054441]",,,30,347,361,0,17,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,22-Sep,2005,437,7058,,,,,574,578,,10.1038/nature03966,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,966FF,WOS:000232004800055,16177794,No,,,11/20/17

In the accompanying paper(2), we proposed a model for the evolutionary constraint on a small protein interaction module ( the WW domain) through application of the SCA, a statistical analysis of multiple sequence alignments(3,4). Construction of artificial protein sequences directed only by the SCA showed that the information extracted by this analysis is sufficient to engineer the WW fold at atomic resolution. Here, we demonstrate that these artificial WW sequences function like their natural counterparts, showing class-specific recognition of proline- containing target peptides(5 - 8). Consistent with SCA predictions, a distributed network of residues mediates functional specificity in WW domains. The ability to recapitulate natural- like function in designed sequences shows that a relatively small quantity of sequence information is sufficient to specify the global energetics of amino acid interactions.","Univ Texas, SW Med Ctr, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Dallas, TX 75390 USA; Univ Texas, SW Med Ctr, Dept Pharmacol, Dallas, TX 75390 USA; MIT, Dept Biol, Ctr Canc Res, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; MIT, Div Biol Engn, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA","Ranganathan, R (reprint author), Univ Texas, SW Med Ctr, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Dallas, TX 75390 USA.",rama.ranganathan@utsouthwestern.edu,,,,,,29,147,148,1,17,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,22-Sep,2005,437,7058,,,,,579,583,,10.1038/nature03990,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,966FF,WOS:000232004800056,16177795,No,,,11/20/17

In contrast to the skin phenotype, the development of arthritic lesions requires T and B cells and signalling through tumour necrosis factor receptor 1 ( TNFR1).

Here we report the discovery of a quasar lying at the edge of a gas cloud, whose size is comparable to that of a small galaxy, but whose spectrum shows no evidence for stars. The gas in the cloud is excited by the quasar itself. If a host galaxy is present, it is at least six times fainter than would normally be expected(8,9) for such a bright quasar.

Oxygen isotopes in planetary materials show variations at the per cent level that are not related to the mass of the isotopes(1,2); rather, they result from the mixture of components having different nucleosynthetic or chemical origins(1-3). Isotopic variations reaching orders of magnitude in minute meteoritic grains are usually attributed to stellar nucleosynthesis before the birth of the Solar System, whereby different grains were contributed by different stars(4,5). Here we report the discovery of abundant silica-rich grains embedded in meteoritic organic matter, having the most extreme O-18/O-16 and O-17/O-16 ratios observed (both similar to 10(-1)) together with a solar silicon isotopic composition. Both O and Si isotopes indicate a single nucleosynthetic process. These compositions can be accounted for by one of two processes: a single exotic evolved star seeding the young Solar System(6), or irradiation of the circumsolar gas by high energy particles accelerated during an active phase of the young Sun. We favour the latter interpretation, because the observed compositions are usually not expected from nucleosynthetic processes in evolved stars, whereas they are predicted by the selective trapping of irradiation products.","Ctr Rech Petrog & Geochim, F-54501 Vandoeuvre Les Nancy, France; Museum Natl Hist Nat, Lab Etud Mat Extraterr, F-75005 Paris, France; Ctr Spectrometrie Nucl & Spectrometrie Masse, F-91405 Orsay, France; Ecole Natl Super Chim Paris, Lab Chim Bioorgan & Organ Phys, F-75231 Paris, France","Aleon, J (reprint author), Lawrence Livermore Natl Lab, Glenn T Seaborg Inst, POB 808,L-231, Livermore, CA 94550 USA.",aleon2@llnl.gov,"Derenne, Sylvie/I-9853-2014","Derenne, Sylvie/0000-0002-3446-9312",,,,30,24,24,0,5,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,15-Sep,2005,437,7057,,,,,385,388,,10.1038/nature03947,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,964AS,WOS:000231849100047,16163350,No,,,11/20/17

The microwave power emitted from a single spin torque nano-oscillator (STNO) is at present typically less than 1 nW. To achieve a more useful power level ( on the order of microwatts), a device could consist of an array of phase coherent STNOs, in a manner analogous to arrays of Josephson junctions and larger semiconductor oscillators(10-12). Here we show that two STNOs in close proximity mutually phase-lock - that is, they synchronize, which is a general tendency of interacting nonlinear oscillator systems(13-15). The phase-locked state is distinct, characterized by a sudden narrowing of signal linewidth and an increase in power due to the coherence of the individual oscillators. Arrays of phase-locked STNOs could be used as nanometre-scale reference oscillators. Furthermore, phase control of array elements ( phased array) could lead to nanometre-scale directional transmitters and receivers for wireless communications.","Natl Inst Stand & Technol, Div Electromagnet Technol, Boulder, CO 80305 USA; Hitachi San Jose Res Ctr, San Jose, CA 95120 USA","Kaka, S (reprint author), Natl Inst Stand & Technol, Div Electromagnet Technol, Boulder, CO 80305 USA.",shehzu21@gmail.com,"Silva, Thomas/C-7605-2013","Silva, Thomas/0000-0001-8164-9642",,,,25,517,526,5,110,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,15-Sep,2005,437,7057,,,,,389,392,,10.1038/nature04035,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,964AS,WOS:000231849100048,16163351,No,,,11/20/17

The rapid release of C-12-enriched biogenic methane as a result of continental-shelf methane hydrate dissociation has been put forward as a possible explanation for this observation(1,7,8). Here we report high-resolution organic carbon-isotope data from well-preserved mudrocks in Yorkshire, UK, which demonstrate that the carbon-isotope excursion occurred in three abrupt stages, each showing a shift of -2 parts per thousand to -3 parts per thousand. Spectral analysis of these carbon-isotope measurements and of high-resolution carbonate abundance data reveals a regular cyclicity. We interpret these results as providing strong evidence that methane release proceeded in three rapid pulses and that these pulses were controlled by astronomically forced changes in climate, superimposed upon longer-term global warming. We also find that the first two pulses of methane release each coincided with the extinction of a large proportion of marine species(9).","Open Univ, Ctr Earth Planetary Space & Astron Res, Dept Earth Sci, Milton Keynes MK7 6AA, Bucks, England; Univ Cologne, Inst Geol, D-50674 Cologne, Germany","Kemp, DB (reprint author), Open Univ, Ctr Earth Planetary Space & Astron Res, Dept Earth Sci, Milton Keynes MK7 6AA, Bucks, England.",d.kemp@open.ac.uk,"Kemp, David/D-7288-2012",,,,,29,208,213,6,52,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,15-Sep,2005,437,7057,,,,,396,399,,10.1038/nature04037,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,964AS,WOS:000231849100050,16163353,No,,,11/20/17

Internal waves are typically the most energetic high-frequency events in the coastal ocean(4-6), displacing water parcels by up to 100 m and generating strong currents and turbulence(7) that mix nutrients into near-surface waters for biological utilization. While internal waves are known to be generated by tidal currents over ocean-bottom topography(8-13), they have also been observed frequently in the absence of any apparent tide topography interactions(1,7,14). Here we present repeated measurements of velocity, density and acoustic backscatter across the Columbia River plume front. These show how internal waves can be generated from a river plume that flows as a gravity current into the coastal ocean. We find that the convergence of horizontal velocities at the plume front causes frontal growth and subsequent displacement downward of near-surface waters. Individual freely propagating waves are released from the river plume front when the front's propagation speed decreases below the wave speed in the water ahead of it. This mechanism generates internal waves of similar amplitude and steepness as internal waves from tide topography interactions observed elsewhere(11), and is therefore important to the understanding of coastal ocean mixing.","Oregon State Univ, Coll Ocean & Atmospher Sci, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA","Nash, JD (reprint author), Oregon State Univ, Coll Ocean & Atmospher Sci, 104 COAS Adm Bldg, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA.",nash@coas.oregonstate.edu,"Moum, James/A-1880-2012",,,,,29,123,131,0,32,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,15-Sep,2005,437,7057,,,,,400,403,,10.1038/nature03936,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,964AS,WOS:000231849100051,16163354,No,,,11/20/17

But this logical predictor of earthquake size(1), unsuccessful for large earthquakes on a strike-slip fault(2), fails also with the giant 1960 Chile earthquake of magnitude 9.5 (ref. 3). Although the time since the preceding earthquake spanned 123 years (refs 4, 5), the estimated slip in 1960, which occurred on a fault between the Nazca and South American tectonic plates, equalled 250 - 350 years' worth of the plate motion(3,6-10). Thus the average interval between such giant earthquakes on this fault should span several centuries(3,9,10). Here we present evidence that such long intervals were indeed typical of the last two millennia. We use buried soils and sand layers as records of tectonic subsidence and tsunami inundation at an estuary midway along the 1960 rupture. In these records, the 1960 earthquake ended a recurrence interval that had begun almost four centuries before, with an earthquake documented by Spanish conquistadors in 1575. Two later earthquakes, in 1737 and 1837, produced little if any subsidence or tsunami at the estuary and they therefore probably left the fault partly loaded with accumulated plate motion that the 1960 earthquake then expended.","Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Fac Agron, Quillota, Chile; Univ Washington, US Geol Survey, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; Univ Concepcion, Ctr EULA Chile, Concepcion, Chile; Univ Concepcion, Dept Ciencias Hist & Sociales, Concepcion, Chile; Natl Inst Adv Ind Sci & Technol, Geol Survey Japan, Act Fault Res Ctr, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058567, Japan; Pontificia Univ Catolica Santiago, Inst Geog, Santiago, Chile; NOAA, Seattle, WA 98115 USA; Ctr Earth Sci Studies, Thiruvananthapuram 69603, Kerala, India; Indian Inst Technol, Kanpur 208016, Uttar Pradesh, India; Inst Technol, Dept Geol, Bandung 40132, Indonesia; Meteorol & Geophys Agcy Indonesia, Potential Geophys Div, Jakarta 10720, Indonesia","Cisternas, M (reprint author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Fac Agron, Casilla 4-D, Quillota, Chile.",marco.cisternas@ucv.cl,"Rajendran, CP/F-4424-2012; Sawai, Yuki /D-3216-2013","Rajendran, CP/0000-0002-1477-7705; Sawai, Yuki /0000-0001-7015-4361; Youlton, Cristian/0000-0002-2369-6990",,,,22,265,269,6,72,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,15-Sep,2005,437,7057,,,,,404,407,,10.1038/nature03943,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,964AS,WOS:000231849100052,16163355,No,,,11/20/17

First, most females revisit and breed with specific, individual males across years, so that their single offspring born in different years are full siblings. Second, relatives in the maternal line, including mothers and daughters, share breeding partners (intra-lineage polygyny) more often than expected by chance. Although these behaviours increased levels of co-ancestry among colony members, there was no concomitant rise in inbreeding. We suggest that when females engage in mate fidelity and intra-lineage polygyny, kin ties among female roost mates will be strengthened, thereby potentially contributing to social group cohesiveness. Our findings reveal the hidden complexity that can underlie polygynous breeding, and highlight a new potential route by which female mate choice could influence social evolution.","Univ London, Queen Mary, Sch Biol Sci, London E1 4NS, England; Univ Bristol, Sch Biol Sci, Bristol BS8 1UG, Avon, England","Rossiter, SJ (reprint author), Univ London, Queen Mary, Sch Biol Sci, London E1 4NS, England.",s.j.rossiter@qmul.ac.uk,"Le Comber, Steven/B-8315-2008; Faulkes, Chris/B-8377-2008; Rossiter, Stephen/E-2111-2011","Jones, Gareth/0000-0002-1904-3735",,,,29,39,40,2,26,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,15-Sep,2005,437,7057,,,,,408,411,,10.1038/nature03965,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,964AS,WOS:000231849100053,16163356,No,,,11/20/17

Here we use visually guided smooth-pursuit eye movements in primates(10) as a testing ground for this notion of optimality. In response to repeated presentations of identical target motions, nearly 92% of the variance in eye trajectory can be accounted for as a consequence of errors in sensory estimates of the speed, direction and timing of target motion, plus a small background noise that is observed both during eye movements and during fixations. The magnitudes of the inferred sensory errors agree with the observed thresholds for sensory discrimination by perceptual systems, suggesting that the very different neural processes of perception and action are limited by the same sources of noise.","Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Physiol, WM Keck Fdn Ctr Integrat Neurosci, Sloan Swartz Ctr Theoret Neurobiol, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; Univ Calif San Francisco, Howard Hughes Med Inst, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; Princeton Univ, Joseph Henry Labs Phys, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; Princeton Univ, Lewis Sigler Inst Integrat Genom, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA","Osborne, LC (reprint author), Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Physiol, WM Keck Fdn Ctr Integrat Neurosci, Sloan Swartz Ctr Theoret Neurobiol, Box 0444, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA.",osborne@phy.ucsf.edu,,"Osborne, Leslie/0000-0002-6080-5279","Howard Hughes Medical Institute; NEI NIH HHS [R01 EY003878, R01 EY003878-25]",,,29,134,134,0,14,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,15-Sep,2005,437,7057,,,,,412,416,,10.1038/nature03961,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,964AS,WOS:000231849100054,16163357,No,,,11/20/17

Here we show that the opportunistic human pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa packages the signalling molecule 2-heptyl-3-hydroxy-4-quinolone ( pseudomonas quinolone signal; PQS)(2) into membrane vesicles that serve to traffic this molecule within a population. Removal of these vesicles from the bacterial population halts cell - cell communication and inhibits PQS-controlled group behaviour. We also show that PQS actively mediates its own packaging and the packaging of other antimicrobial quinolines produced by P. aeruginosa into vesicles. These findings illustrate that a prokaryote possesses a signal trafficking system with features common to those used by higher organisms and outlines a novel mechanism for delivery of a signal critical for coordinating group behaviour in P. aeruginosa.","Univ Oklahoma, Hlth Sci Ctr, Dept Periodont, Oklahoma City, OK 73104 USA; Univ Oklahoma, Hlth Sci Ctr, Dept Microbiol & Immunol, Oklahoma City, OK 73104 USA","Whiteley, M (reprint author), Univ Oklahoma, Hlth Sci Ctr, Dept Periodont, Oklahoma City, OK 73104 USA.",marvin-whiteley@ouhsc.edu,,,,,,26,335,344,5,52,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,15-Sep,2005,437,7057,,,,,422,425,,10.1038/nature03925,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,964AS,WOS:000231849100056,16163359,No,,,11/20/17

Previous work showed that the conversion of integrins to a high-affinity state mediates a subset of shear responses, including cell alignment and gene expression(2-4). Here we investigate the pathway upstream of integrin activation. PECAM-1 ( which directly transmits mechanical force), vascular endothelial cell cadherin ( which functions as an adaptor) and VEGFR2 ( which activates phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase) comprise a mechanosensory complex. Together, these receptors are sufficient to confer responsiveness to flow in heterologous cells. In support of the relevance of this pathway in vivo, PECAM-1-knockout mice do not activate NF-kappa B and downstream inflammatory genes in regions of disturbed flow. Therefore, this mechanosensing pathway is required for the earliest-known events in atherogenesis.","Scripps Res Inst, Dept Cell Biol, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; Univ Milan, Mario Negri Inst Pharmacol Res, I-20139 Milan, Italy; Univ Milan, Fac Sci, Dept Biomol & Biotechnol Sci, FIRC Inst Mol Oncol, I-20139 Milan, Italy; Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Phys, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; Univ Bern, Theodor Kocher Inst, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland; Univ Penn, Med Ctr, Dept Med, Div Pulm & Crit Care, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; Univ Virginia, Mellon Prostate Canc Res Ctr, Cardiovasc Res Ctr, Dept Microbiol, Charlottesville, VA 22908 USA; Univ Virginia, Mellon Prostate Canc Res Ctr, Cardiovasc Res Ctr, Dept Biomed Engn, Charlottesville, VA 22908 USA","Schwartz, MA (reprint author), Scripps Res Inst, Dept Cell Biol, 10550 N Torrey Pines Rd, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA.",maschwartz@virginia.edu,"Tzima, Ellie/L-9256-2017","Tzima, Ellie/0000-0002-3437-0902; Engelhardt, Britta/0000-0003-3059-9846",,,,30,744,767,9,121,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,15-Sep,2005,437,7057,,,,,426,431,,10.1038/nature03952,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,964AS,WOS:000231849100057,16163360,No,,,11/20/17

We have shown that the BHC complex is recruited by a neuronal silencer, REST (RE1-silencing transcription factor), and mediates the repression of REST-responsive genes1. BHC is a multiprotein complex consisting of two enzymatic activities: a histone deacetylase (HDAC1 or 2) and a recently described histone demethylase (BHC110, also known as LSD1 or AOF2)(1-3). Here we show that BHC110-containing complexes show a nearly fivefold increase in demethylation of histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4) compared to recombinant BHC110. Furthermore, recombinant BHC110 is unable to demethylate H3K4 on nucleosomes, but BHC110-containing complexes readily demethylate nucleosomes. In vitro reconstitution of the BHC complex using recombinant subunits reveals an essential role for the REST corepressor CoREST, not only in stimulating demethylation on core histones but also promoting demethylation of nucleosomal substrates. We find that nucleosomal demethylation is the result of CoREST enhancing the association between BHC110 and nucleosomes. Depletion of CoREST in in vivo cell culture results in de-repression of REST-responsive gene expression and increased methylation of H3K4. Together, these results highlight an essential role for CoREST in demethylation of H3K4 both in vitro and in vivo.","Wistar Inst Anat & Biol, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA","Shiekhattar, R (reprint author), Wistar Inst Anat & Biol, 3601 Spruce St, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",shiekhattar@wistar.org,,,,,,23,440,460,2,26,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,15-Sep,2005,437,7057,,,,,432,435,,10.1038/nature04021,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,964AS,WOS:000231849100058,16079794,No,,,11/20/17

Gene activation and repression is specifically regulated by histone methylation status at distinct lysine residues(2). Here we show that lysine-specific demethylase 1 (LSD1; also known as BHC110)(3) co-localizes with the androgen receptor in normal human prostate and prostate tumour. LSD1 interacts with androgen receptor in vitro and in vivo, and stimulates androgen-receptor-dependent transcription. Conversely, knockdown of LSD1 protein levels abrogates androgen-induced transcriptional activation and cell proliferation. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analyses demonstrate that androgen receptor and LSD1 form chromatin-associated complexes in a ligand-dependent manner. LSD1 relieves repressive histone marks by demethylation of histone H3 at lysine 9 (H3-K9), thereby leading to de-repression of androgen receptor target genes. Furthermore, we identify pargyline as an inhibitor of LSD1. Pargyline blocks demethylation of H3-K9 by LSD1 and consequently androgen-receptor-dependent transcription. Thus, modulation of LSD1 activity offers a new strategy to regulate androgen receptor functions. Here, we link demethylation of a repressive histone mark with androgen-receptor-dependent gene activation, thus providing a mechanism by which demethylases control specific gene expression.","Univ Freiburg Klinikum, Univ Frauenklin, D-79106 Freiburg, Germany; Univ Freiburg Klinikum, Zentrum Klin Forsch, D-79106 Freiburg, Germany; Max Planck Inst Immunbiol, D-79108 Freiburg, Germany; Novartis Res Fdn, Friedrich Miescher Inst Biomed Res, CH-4058 Basel, Switzerland; Univ Klinikum Bonn, Inst Pathol, D-53127 Bonn, Germany","Schule, R (reprint author), Univ Freiburg Klinikum, Univ Frauenklin, Breisacherstr 66, D-79106 Freiburg, Germany.",roland.schuele@uniklinik-freiburg.de,,"Gunther, Thomas/0000-0003-3903-9490",,,,16,891,933,3,61,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,15-Sep,2005,437,7057,,,,,436,439,,10.1038/nature04020,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,964AS,WOS:000231849100059,16079795,No,,,11/20/17

This biological function results from its ability to tether broken DNA molecules(2,3). hR/M/N's dynamic molecular architecture consists of a globular DNA-binding domain from which two 50-nm-long coiled coils protrude. The coiled coils are flexible(4) and their apices can self-associate(5). The flexibility of the coiled coils allows their apices to adopt an orientation favourable for interaction. However, this also allows interaction between the tips of two coiled coils within the same complex, which competes with and frustrates the intercomplex interaction required for DNA tethering. Here we show that the dynamic architecture of hR/M/N is markedly affected by DNA binding. DNAbinding by the hR/M/N globular domain leads to parallel orientation of the coiled coils; this prevents intracomplex interactions and favours intercomplex associations needed for DNA tethering. The hR/M/N complex thus is an example of a biological nanomachine in which binding to its ligand, in this case DNA, affects the functional conformation of a domain located 50 nm distant.","Delft Univ Technol, Kavli Inst Nanosci, NL-2628 CJ Delft, Netherlands; Erasmus MC, Dept Cell Biol & Genet, NL-3000 DR Rotterdam, Netherlands; Erasmus MC, Dept Radiat Oncol, NL-3000 DR Rotterdam, Netherlands","Dekker, C (reprint author), Delft Univ Technol, Kavli Inst Nanosci, Lorentzweg 1, NL-2628 CJ Delft, Netherlands.",c.wyman@erasmusmc.nl; dekker@mb.tn.tudelft.nl,"Moreno-Herrero, Fernando/N-2967-2013","Moreno-Herrero, Fernando/0000-0003-4083-1709; Dekker, Cees/0000-0001-6273-071X; Dekker, Nynke/0000-0003-4029-0973",,,,11,172,177,0,15,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,15-Sep,2005,437,7057,,,,,440,443,,10.1038/nature03927,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,964AS,WOS:000231849100060,16163361,No,,,11/20/17

Although currently incapable of sustained human-to-human transmission, H5N1 represents a serious pandemic threat owing to the risk of a mutation or reassortment generating a virus with increased transmissibility. Identifying public health interventions that might be able to halt a pandemic in its earliest stages is therefore a priority. Here we use a simulation model of influenza transmission in Southeast Asia to evaluate the potential effectiveness of targeted mass prophylactic use of antiviral drugs as a containment strategy. Other interventions aimed at reducing population contact rates are also examined as reinforcements to an antiviral-based containment policy. We show that elimination of a nascent pandemic may be feasible using a combination of geographically targeted prophylaxis and social distancing measures, if the basic reproduction number of the new virus is below 1.8. We predict that a stockpile of 3 million courses of antiviral drugs should be sufficient for elimination.

Here we present the crystal structure of a bacterial homologue of these transporters from Aquifex aeolicus, in complex with its substrate, leucine, and two sodium ions. The protein core consists of the first ten of twelve transmembrane segments, with segments 1 - 5 related to 6 - 10 by a pseudo-two-fold axis in the membrane plane. Leucine and the sodium ions are bound within the protein core, halfway across the membrane bilayer, in an occluded site devoid of water. The leucine and ion binding sites are defined by partially unwound transmembrane helices, with main-chain atoms and helix dipoles having key roles in substrate and ion binding. The structure reveals the architecture of this important class of transporter, illuminates the determinants of substrate binding and ion selectivity, and defines the external and internal gates.","Columbia Univ, Dept Biochem & Mol Biophys, New York, NY 10032 USA; Columbia Univ, Howard Hughes Med Inst, New York, NY 10032 USA","Gouaux, E (reprint author), Columbia Univ, Dept Biochem & Mol Biophys, 650 W 168th St, New York, NY 10032 USA.",jeg52@columbia.edu,"Yamashita, Atsuko/H-5566-2017","Yamashita, Atsuko/0000-0002-8001-4642",,,,50,996,1009,2,117,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,8-Sep,2005,437,7056,,,,,215,223,,10.1038/nature03978,,9,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,961YE,WOS:000231696900047,16041361,No,,,11/20/17

The asteroid belt therefore preserves a record of both this earliest epoch of Solar System formation and variation of conditions within the solar nebula. Spectral features in reflected sunlight indicate that some asteroids have experienced sufficient thermal evolution to differentiate into layered structures(1). The second most massive asteroid - 4 Vesta - has differentiated to a crust, mantle and core(2,3). 1 Ceres, the largest and most massive asteroid, has in contrast been presumed to be homogeneous, in part because of its low density, low albedo and relatively featureless visible reflectance spectrum, similar to carbonaceous meteorites that have suffered minimal thermal processing(4). Here we show that Ceres has a shape and smoothness indicative of a gravitationally relaxed object. Its shape is significantly less flattened than that expected for a homogeneous object, but is consistent with a central mass concentration indicative of differentiation.

Here we show, on the basis of the analysis of a rare event where the outer radiation belt was depleted and then re-formed closer to the Earth(6), that the long established theory of acceleration by radial diffusion is inadequate; the electrons are accelerated more effectively by electromagnetic waves at frequencies of a few kilohertz. Wave acceleration can increase the electron flux by more than three orders of magnitude over the observed timescale of one to two days, more than sufficient to explain the new radiation belt.

But fluctuation theorems(1-5) allow us to relate the work along nonequilibrium trajectories to thermodynamic free-energy differences. They have been shown to be applicable to single-molecule force measurements(6) and have already provided information on the folding free energy of a RNA hairpin(7,8). Here we show that the Crooks fluctuation theorem(9) can be used to determine folding free energies for folding and unfolding processes occurring in weak as well as strong nonequilibrium regimes, thereby providing a test of its validity under such conditions. We use optical tweezers(10) to measure repeatedly the mechanical work associated with the unfolding and refolding of a small RNA hairpin(11) and an RNA three-helix junction(12).

This is because they display the same phase behaviour as atoms or molecules, with the nano- to micrometre size of the colloidal particles making it possible to observe them directly in real space(3,4). Another attractive feature is that different types of colloidal interactions, such as long-range repulsive(1,3), short-range attractive(5), hard-sphere-like(2-4) and dipolar(3), can be realized and give rise to equilibrium phases. However, spherically symmetric, long-range attractions ( that is, ionic interactions) have so far always resulted in irreversible colloidal aggregation(6). Here we show that the electrostatic interaction between oppositely charged particles can be tuned such that large ionic colloidal crystals form readily, with our theory and simulations confirming the stability of these structures. We find that in contrast to atomic systems, the stoichiometry of our colloidal crystals is not dictated by charge neutrality; this allows us to obtain a remarkable diversity of new binary structures. An external electric field melts the crystals, confirming that the constituent particles are indeed oppositely charged. Colloidal model systems can thus be used to study the phase behaviour of ionic species. We also expect that our approach to controlling opposite-charge interactions will facilitate the production of binary crystals of micrometre-sized particles, which could find use as advanced materials for photonic applications(7).","Univ Utrecht, Debye Inst, NL-3584 CC Utrecht, Netherlands; Univ Utrecht, Inst Theoret Phys, NL-3584 CE Utrecht, Netherlands","Leunissen, ME (reprint author), Univ Utrecht, Debye Inst, Princetonpl 5, NL-3584 CC Utrecht, Netherlands.",M.E.Leunissen@phys.uu.nl; A.vanBlaaderen@phys.uu.nl,"Imhof, Arnout/B-6655-2009; Dijkstra, Marjolein/B-6656-2009; van Roij, Rene/E-5163-2011; Campbell, Andrew/F-7690-2013; van Blaaderen, Alfons/B-6304-2009; Institute (DINS), Debye/G-7730-2014","Imhof, Arnout/0000-0002-7445-1360; Campbell, Andrew/0000-0001-6213-0757; van Blaaderen, Alfons/0000-0003-3090-2753; Royall, C.

The possibility that climate change is being reinforced by increased carbon dioxide emissions from soils owing to rising temperature is the subject of a continuing debate(2-9). But evidence for the suggested feedback mechanism has to date come solely from small-scale laboratory and field experiments and modelling studies(2-9). Here we use data from the National Soil Inventory of England and Wales obtained between 1978 and 2003 to show that carbon was lost from soils across England and Wales over the survey period at a mean rate of 0.6% yr(-1) ( relative to the existing soil carbon content). We find that the relative rate of carbon loss increased with soil carbon content and was more than 2% yr(-1) in soils with carbon contents greater than 100 g kg(-1). The relationship between rate of carbon loss and carbon content is irrespective of land use, suggesting a link to climate change.

Conductive cooling models predict structure that increases in depth with age, extending to about 30 km at 4.5 Myr ago.

Such parasite specialization on local hosts has implications for human health and agriculture. By contrast with classic single-species population-genetic models(6,7), theory indicates that parasite migration between subpopulations might increase parasite local adaptation, as long as migration does not completely homogenize populations(8-11). To test this hypothesis we developed a system-specific mathematical model and then coevolved replicate populations of the bacterium Pseudomonas fluorescens and a parasitic bacteriophage with parasite only, with host only or with no migration. Here we show that patterns of local adaptation have considerable temporal and spatial variation and that, in the absence of migration, parasites tend to be locally maladapted.

However, questions have arisen as to whether such fibrils or smaller subfibrillar oligomers are the prime causes of disease(1,2). Abnormal deposits in TSEs are rich in PrPres, a protease-resistant form of the PrP protein with the ability to convert the normal, protease-sensitive form of the protein (PrPsen) into PrPres (ref. 3). TSEs can be transmitted between organisms by an enigmatic agent (prion) that contains PrPres (refs 4 and 5). To evaluate systematically the relationship between infectivity, converting activity and the size of various PrPres-containing aggregates, PrPres was partially disaggregated, fractionated by size and analysed by light scattering and non-denaturing gel electrophoresis. Our analyses revealed that with respect to PrP content, infectivity and converting activity peaked markedly in 17 - 27- nm (300 - 600 kDa) particles, whereas these activities were substantially lower in large fibrils and virtually absent in oligomers of <= 5 PrP molecules.

Newly synthesized prion protein generally adopts the form already present in the cell, and this in vivo folding bias directs the near faithful transmission of the corresponding phenotypic state(1,2). Switches between the prion and non-prion phenotypes can occur in vivo(2); however, the fate of existing protein during these transitions and its effects on the emergence of new traits remain major unanswered questions. Here, we determine the changes in protein-state that induce phenotypic switching for the yeast prion Sup35/[PSI+]. We show that the prion form does not need to be specified by an alternate misfolding pathway initiated during Sup35 synthesis but instead can be accessed by mature protein. This remodelling of protein from one stable form to another is accompanied by the loss of Sup35 activity, evoking a rapid change in cellular phenotype within a single cell cycle.","Brown Univ, Dept Mol Biol Cell Biol & Biochem, Providence, RI 02912 USA","Serio, TR (reprint author), Brown Univ, Dept Mol Biol Cell Biol & Biochem, Providence, RI 02912 USA.",Tricia_Serio@Brown.edu,,,,,,30,61,64,0,4,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,8-Sep,2005,437,7056,,,,,262,265,,10.1038/nature03981,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,961YE,WOS:000231696900057,16148935,No,,,11/20/17

The incidence increases with age, and it is often associated with a bicuspid aortic valve present in 1 - 2% of the population(2). Despite the frequency, neither the mechanisms of valve calcification nor the developmental origin of a two, rather than three, leaflet aortic valve is known. Here, we show that mutations in the signalling and transcriptional regulator NOTCH1 cause a spectrum of developmental aortic valve anomalies and severe valve calcification in non-syndromic autosomal-dominant human pedigrees. Consistent with the valve calcification phenotype, Notch1 transcripts were most abundant in the developing aortic valve of mice, and Notch1 repressed the activity of Runx2, a central transcriptional regulator of osteoblast cell fate. The hairy-related family of transcriptional repressors (Hrt), which are activated by Notch1 signalling, physically interacted with Runx2 and repressed Runx2 transcriptional activity independent of histone deacetylase activity. These results suggest that NOTCH1 mutations cause an early developmental defect in the aortic valve and a later de-repression of calcium deposition that causes progressive aortic valve disease.","Univ Texas, SW Med Ctr, Dept Pediat, Dallas, TX 75390 USA; Univ Texas, SW Med Ctr, Dept Mol Biol, Dallas, TX 75390 USA; Univ Texas, SW Med Ctr, Dept Internal Med, Dallas, TX 75390 USA; Univ Texas, SW Med Ctr, McDermott Ctr Human Growth & Dev, Dallas, TX 75390 USA; Childrens Med Ctr, Dallas, TX 75235 USA; Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Pediat, Div Cardiol, San Diego, CA 92123 USA","Garg, V (reprint author), Univ Texas, SW Med Ctr, Dept Pediat, 6000 Harry Hines Blvd,Room NA8-124, Dallas, TX 75390 USA.",vidu.garg@utsouthwestern.edu; dsrivastava@gladstone.ucsf.edu,"Garg, Vidu/E-3101-2011; Garg, Vidu/D-8240-2012","Garg, Vidu/0000-0002-3778-5927","NHLBI NIH HHS [K08 HL079260-01, K08 HL079260]; NICHD NIH HHS [K08 HD001382]",,,30,665,695,4,41,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,8-Sep,2005,437,7056,,,,,270,274,,10.1038/nature03940,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,961YE,WOS:000231696900059,16025100,No,,,11/20/17

To perform these functions, proliferative basal cells in the innermost layer periodically detach from an underlying basement membrane of extracellular matrix, move outward and eventually die. Once suprabasal, cells stop dividing and enter a differentiation programme to form the barrier(1). The mechanism of stratification is poorly understood. Although studies in vitro have led to the view that stratification occurs through the delamination and subsequent movement of epidermal cells(2-4), most culture conditions favour keratinocytes that lack the polarity and cuboidal morphology of basal keratinocytes in tissue. These features could be important in considering an alternative mechanism, that stratification occurs through asymmetric cell divisions in which the mitotic spindle orients perpendicularly to the basement membrane(5-7). Here we show that basal epidermal cells use their polarity to divide asymmetrically, generating a committed suprabasal cell and a proliferative basal cell. We further demonstrate that integrins and cadherins are essential for the apical localization of atypical protein kinase C, the Par3 - LGN - Inscuteable complex and NuMA - dynactin to align the spindle.","Rockefeller Univ, Howard Hughes Med Inst, New York, NY 10021 USA","Fuchs, E (reprint author), Rockefeller Univ, Howard Hughes Med Inst, New York, NY 10021 USA.",fuchslb@rockefeller.edu,,,"NIAMS NIH HHS [R01 AR027883, R01 AR027883-28]",,,31,552,571,1,33,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,8-Sep,2005,437,7056,,,,,275,280,,10.1038/nature03922,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,961YE,WOS:000231696900060,16094321,No,,,11/20/17

An important mechanism in the stimulation of AP-1 function is amino-terminal phosphorylation of c-Jun by the c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNKs)(2). Phosphorylated c-Jun is biologically more active, partially because it acquires the ability to interact with binding partners. Here we show that phosphorylated c-Jun interacts with the HMG-box transcription factor TCF4 to form a ternary complex containing c-Jun, TCF4 and beta-catenin. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays revealed JNK-dependent c-Jun - TCF4 interaction on the c-jun promoter, and c-Jun and TCF4 cooperatively activated the c-jun promoter in reporter assays in a beta-catenin-dependent manner. In the Apc(Min) mouse model of intestinal cancer(6), genetic abrogation of c-Jun N-terminal phosphorylation(3) or gut-specific conditional c-jun inactivation(4,5) reduced tumour number and size and prolonged lifespan. Therefore, the phosphorylation-dependent interaction between c-Jun and TCF4 regulates intestinal tumorigenesis by integrating JNK and APC/beta-catenin, two distinct pathways activated by WNT signalling.","CR UK London Res Inst, Lincolns Inn Fields Labs, Mammalian Genet Lab, London WC2A 3PX, England; CR UK London Res Inst, Lincolns Inn Fields Labs, Expt Pathol Lab, London WC2A 3PX, England; Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Dept Histopathol, London SW7 2AZ, England","Behrens, A (reprint author), CR UK London Res Inst, Lincolns Inn Fields Labs, Mammalian Genet Lab, 44 Lincolns Inn Fields, London WC2A 3PX, England.",axel.behrens@cancer.org.uk,,"Shams Nateri, Abdolrahman/0000-0002-6422-6813",,,,24,227,241,0,13,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,8-Sep,2005,437,7056,,,,,281,285,,10.1038/nature03914,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,961YE,WOS:000231696900061,16007074,No,,,11/20/17

The process maintains a transmembrane electrochemical proton gradient that is used, for example, in the synthesis of ATP. In mitochondria and many bacteria, the last enzyme complex in the electron transfer chain is cytochrome c oxidase (CytcO), which catalyses the four-electron reduction of O-2 to H2O using electrons delivered by a water-soluble donor, cytochrome c(1-7). The electron transfer through CytcO, accompanied by proton uptake to form H2O drives the physical movement ( pumping) of four protons across the membrane(8) per reduced O-2. So far, the molecular mechanism of such proton pumping driven by electron transfer has not been determined in any biological system. Here we show that proton pumping in CytcO is mechanistically coupled to proton transfer to O-2 at the catalytic site, rather than to internal electron transfer. This scenario suggests a principle by which redox-driven proton pumps might operate and puts considerable constraints on possible molecular mechanisms by which CytcO translocates protons.","Stockholm Univ, Arrhenius Lab, Dept Biochem & Biophys, SE-10691 Stockholm, Sweden","Brzezinski, P (reprint author), Stockholm Univ, Arrhenius Lab, Dept Biochem & Biophys, SE-10691 Stockholm, Sweden.",peterb@dbb.su.se,,,,,,30,186,188,2,55,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,8-Sep,2005,437,7056,,,,,286,289,,10.1038/nature03921,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,961YE,WOS:000231696900062,16148937,No,,,11/20/17

In terms of numbers of base pairs affected, we determine that de novo duplication has contributed most significantly to differences between the species, followed by deletion of ancestral duplications.

Chimpanzee-specific hyperexpansion (. 100 copies) of particular segments of DNA have resulted in marked quantitative differences and alterations in the genome landscape between chimpanzee and human.

We assess the relative contribution of the principal mechanisms of ectopic DNA repair to the formation of subtelomeric duplications and find that non-homologous end-joining predominates. Once subtelomeric duplications arise, they are prone to homology-based sequence transfers as shown by the incongruent phylogenetic relationships of neighbouring sections. Interchromosomal recombination of subtelomeres is a potent force for recent change. Cytogenetic and sequence analyses reveal that pieces of the subtelomeric patchwork have changed location and copy number with unprecedented frequency during primate evolution. Half of the known subtelomeric sequence has formed recently, through human-specific sequence transfers and duplications. Subtelomeric dynamics result in a gene duplication rate significantly higher than the genome average and could have both advantageous and pathological consequences in human biology.

The enormity of this evolutionary decline has led to predictions that the Y chromosome will be completely bereft of functional genes within ten million years(1,2). Although recent evidence of gene conversion within massive Y-linked palindromes runs counter to this hypothesis, most unique Y-linked genes are not situated in palindromes and have no gene conversion partners(3,4). The 'impending demise' hypothesis thus rests on understanding the degree of conservation of these genes. Here we find, by systematically comparing the DNA sequences of unique, Y-linked genes in chimpanzee and human, which diverged about six million years ago, evidence that in the human lineage, all such genes were conserved through purifying selection.

This situation has fuelled speculation regarding causes for the divergence of the human and chimpanzee lineages five to eight million years ago. Some investigators have invoked a shift from wooded to savannah vegetation in East Africa, driven by climate change, to explain the apparent separation between chimpanzee and human ancestral populations and the origin of the unique hominin locomotor adaptation, bipedalism(2-5). The Rift Valley itself functions as an obstacle to chimpanzee occupation in some scenarios(6). Here we report the first fossil chimpanzee. These fossils, from the Kapthurin Formation, Kenya, show that representatives of Pan were present in the East African Rift Valley during the Middle Pleistocene, where they were contemporary with an extinct species of Homo.

Within the context of applications, quantum cryptography offers a provably secure way to establish a confidential key between distant partners(7). Photons represent the natural flying qubit carriers for quantum communication, and the presence of telecommunications optical fibres makes the wavelengths of 1,310 nm and 1,550 nm particularly suitable for distribution over long distances. However, qubits encoded into alkaline atoms that absorb and emit at wavelengths around 800 nm have been considered for the storage and processing of quantum information(8,9). Hence, future quantum information networks made of telecommunications channels and alkaline memories will require interfaces that enable qubit transfers between these useful wavelengths, while preserving quantum coherence and entanglement(9-11). Here we report a demonstration of qubit transfer between photons of wavelength 1,310 nm and 710 nm. The mechanism is a nonlinear up-conversion process, with a success probability of greater than 5 per cent. In the event of a successful qubit transfer, we observe strong two-photon interference between the 710 nm photon and a third photon at 1,550 nm, initially entangled with the 1,310 nm photon, although they never directly interacted.

But the interpretation of the oxygen isotope records is complicated because both isotope storage in ice sheets and deep-water temperature affect the recorded isotopic composition(1-5). Separating these two effects would require long records of either sea level or deep-ocean temperature, which are currently not available. Here we use a coupled model of the Northern Hemisphere ice sheets(6) and ocean temperatures, forced to match an oxygen isotope record for the past million years compiled from 57 globally distributed sediment cores, to quantify both contributions simultaneously. We find that the ice-sheet contribution to the variability in oxygen isotope composition varied from ten per cent in the beginning of glacial periods to sixty per cent at glacial maxima, suggesting that strong ocean cooling preceded slow ice-sheet build-up. The model yields mutually consistent time series of continental mean surface temperatures between 40 and 80 degrees N, ice volume and global sea level. We find that during extreme glacial stages, air temperatures were 17 +/- 1.8 degrees C lower than present, with a 120 +/- 10 m sea level equivalent of continental ice present.","Univ Utrecht, Inst Marine & Atmospher Res Utrecht, NL-3584 CC Utrecht, Netherlands","Bintanja, R (reprint author), Univ Utrecht, Inst Marine & Atmospher Res Utrecht, Princetonpl 5, NL-3584 CC Utrecht, Netherlands.",R.Bintanja@phys.uu.nl,"Oerlemans, Johannes/G-3802-2011; van de wal, roderik/D-1705-2011",,,,,30,301,314,3,97,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,1-Sep,2005,437,7055,,,,,125,128,,10.1038/nature03975,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,960AC,WOS:000231560400054,16136140,No,,,11/20/17

Here we quantify structural observations of the Punchbowl fault, a large-displacement exhumed fault(11,12) in the San Andreas fault system, and show that the energy required to create the fracture surface area in the fault is about 300 times greater than seismological estimates would predict for a single large earthquake. If fracture energy is attributed entirely to the production of fracture surfaces, then all of the fracture surface area in the Punchbowl fault could have been produced by earthquake displacements totalling <1 km. But this would only account for a small fraction of the total energy budget, and therefore additional processes probably contributed to slip weakening during earthquake rupture.","Texas A&M Univ, Dept Geol & Geophys, Ctr Tectonophys, College Stn, TX 77843 USA","Chester, JS (reprint author), Texas A&M Univ, Dept Geol & Geophys, Ctr Tectonophys, College Stn, TX 77843 USA.",chesterj@geo.tamu.edu,,,,,,30,156,159,1,26,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,1-Sep,2005,437,7055,,,,,133,136,,10.1038/nature03942,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,960AC,WOS:000231560400056,16136142,No,,,11/20/17

Spontaneous tumours often induce a specific immune response and are therefore also immunogenic. However, it is not clear whether they can be controlled by T cells(3-10). The immunosurveillance hypothesis postulates that tumours, if they eventually grow, escaped T-cell recognition by losing immunogenicity(6-8). Here we show, by generating a mouse model of sporadic cancer based on rare spontaneous activation of a dormant oncogene, that immunogenic tumours do not escape their recognition but induce tolerance. In this model, tumours derive from single cells and express a tumour-specific transplantation rejection antigen. Whereas vaccinated mice remain tumour-free throughout their lifetime, naive mice always develop a progressively growing tumour. We also show that despite specific recognition by T cells, the tumours do not lose their intrinsic immunogenicity and are rejected after transplantation in T-cell-competent recipients. Furthermore, in the primary host tumour-induced tolerance is associated with the expansion of non-functional T cells. Together, our data argue against immunosurveillance of spontaneous cancer.","Inst Immunol, D-12200 Berlin, Germany; Max Delbruck Ctr Mol Med, D-13122 Berlin, Germany","Blankenstein, T (reprint author), Inst Immunol, Charite Campus Benjamin Franklin,Hindenburgdamm 3, D-12200 Berlin, Germany.",tblanke@mdc-berlin.de,,,,,,29,269,283,0,20,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,1-Sep,2005,437,7055,,,,,141,146,,10.1038/nature03954,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,960AC,WOS:000231560400058,16136144,No,,,11/20/17

Furthermore, the region of chromosome 5 to which NPM1 maps is deleted in a proportion of de novo human myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS)(6-9), and loss of chromosome 5 is extremely frequent in therapy-related MDS9,10. NPM is a multifunctional protein(11-15), and its role in oncogenesis is controversial as NPM has been attributed with both oncogenic and tumour suppressive functions(16-19). To study the function of Npm in vivo, we generated a hypomorphic Npm1 mutant series (Npm1(+/-) < Npm1(hy/ hy) < Npm1(-/-)) in mouse. Here we report that Npm is essential for embryonic development and the maintenance of genomic stability. Npm1(-/-) and Npm1(hy/hy) mutants have aberrant organogenesis and die between embryonic day E11.5 and E16.5 owing to severe anaemia resulting from defects in primitive haematopoiesis. We show that Npm1 inactivation leads to unrestricted centrosome duplication and genomic instability. We demonstrate that Npm is haploinsufficient in the control of genetic stability and that Npm1 heterozygosity accelerates oncogenesis both in vitro and in vivo. Notably, Npm1(+/-) mice develop a haematological syndrome with features of human MDS. Our findings uncover an essential developmental role for Npm and implicate its functional loss in tumorigenesis and MDS pathogenesis.","Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Sloan Kettering Inst, Dept Pathol, Canc Biol & Genet Program, New York, NY 10021 USA; Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Sloan Kettering Inst, Dept Med, Lab Cellular Immunobiol, New York, NY 10021 USA; Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Sloan Kettering Inst, Mol Cytol Core Facil, Dev Biol Program, New York, NY 10021 USA","Pandolfi, PP (reprint author), Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Sloan Kettering Inst, Dept Pathol, Canc Biol & Genet Program, 1275 York Ave, New York, NY 10021 USA.",p-pandolfi@ski.mskcc.org,"bernardi, rosa/B-1650-2013","Khandker, Luipa/0000-0001-6274-0520; ROSSI, Marco/0000-0002-7258-475X; Bernardi, Rosa/0000-0002-3607-6336",,,,30,360,384,1,17,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,1-Sep,2005,437,7055,,,,,147,153,,10.1038/nature03915,,7,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,960AC,WOS:000231560400059,16007073,No,,,11/20/17

We find that a single sterol molecule binds within a hydrophobic tunnel in a manner consistent with a transport function for ORPs. The entrance is blocked by a flexible amino-terminal lid and surrounded by basic residues that are critical for Osh4 function. The structure of the open state of a lid-truncated form of Osh4 was determined at 2.5 angstrom resolution. Structural analysis and limited proteolysis show that sterol binding closes the lid and stabilizes a conformation favouring transport across aqueous barriers and signal transmission. The structure of Osh4 in the absence of ligand exposes potential phospholipid-binding sites that are positioned for membrane docking and sterol exchange. On the basis of these observations, we propose a model in which sterol and membrane binding promote reciprocal conformational changes that facilitate a sterol transfer and signalling cycle.","NIDDKD, Mol Biol Lab, NIH, US Dept Hlth & Human Serv, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; NIDDKD, Lab Cell Biochem & Biol, NIH, US Dept Hlth & Human Serv, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; Gwangju Inst Sci & Technol, Dept Life Sci, Gwangju City 500712, South Korea","Hurley, JH (reprint author), NIDDKD, Mol Biol Lab, NIH, US Dept Hlth & Human Serv, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA.",hurley@helix.nih.gov,,"Raychaudhuri, Sumana/0000-0002-3164-0057",Intramural NIH HHS; NIDDK NIH HHS [Z01 DK036118-12],,,30,216,220,0,19,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,1-Sep,2005,437,7055,,,,,154,158,,10.1038/nature03923,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,960AC,WOS:000231560400060,16136145,No,,,11/20/17

Hydrophobicity induces a drying transition in the gap between simple sufficiently large ( more than 1 nm(2)) strongly hydrophobic surfaces as they approach each other(1-6), resulting in the subsequent collapse of the system, as well as a depletion of water next to single surfaces(7-10). Here we investigate whether the hydrophobic induced collapse of multidomain proteins or the formation of protein oligimers exhibits a similar drying transition. We performed computer simulations to study the collapse of the tetramer of melittin in water, and observed a marked water drying transition inside a nanoscale channel of the tetramer ( with a channel size of up to two or three water-molecule diameters). This transition, although occurring on a microscopic length scale, is analogous to a first-order phase transition from liquid to vapour. We find that this drying is very sensitive to single mutations of the three isoleucines to less hydrophobic residues and that such mutations in the right locations can switch the channel from being dry to being wet. Thus, quite subtle changes in hydrophobic surface topology can profoundly influence the drying transition. We show that, even in the presence of the polar protein backbone, sufficiently hydrophobic protein surfaces can induce a liquid - vapour transition providing an enormous driving force towards further collapse. This behaviour was unexpected because of the absence of drying in the collapse of the multidomain protein 2,3-dihydroxybiphenyl dioxygenase (BphC).","Columbia Univ, Dept Chem, New York, NY 10027 USA; IBM Corp, Thomas J Watson Res Ctr, Computat Biol Ctr, Yorktown Hts, NY 10598 USA","Zhou, RH (reprint author), Columbia Univ, Dept Chem, New York, NY 10027 USA.",ruhongz@us.ibm.com; berne@chem.columbia.edu,,,,,,20,266,272,4,74,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,1-Sep,2005,437,7055,,,,,159,162,,10.1038/nature03926,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,960AC,WOS:000231560400061,16136146,No,,,11/20/17

Here we present a new global data compilation of ocean island basalts, representing upwelling 'plumes' from the deep mantle, and show that island groups with the highest primordial signal ( high He-3/He-4 ratios) have striking chemical and isotopic similarities to mid-ocean-ridge basalts. We interpret this as indicating a common history of mantle trace element depletion through magmatism. The high He-3/He-4 in plumes may thus reflect incomplete degassing of the deep Earth during continent and ocean crust formation. We infer that differences between plumes and the upper-mantle source of ocean-ridge basalts reflect isolation of plume sources from the convecting mantle for similar to 1-2 Gyr. An undegassed, primordial reservoir in the mantle would therefore not be required, thus reconciling a long-standing contradiction in mantle dynamics.","Columbia Univ, Lamont Doherty Earth Observ, Palisades, NY 10964 USA; Columbia Univ, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, Palisades, NY 10964 USA","Class, C (reprint author), Columbia Univ, Lamont Doherty Earth Observ, Palisades, NY 10964 USA.",class@ldeo.columbia.edu,,,,,,49,100,105,0,42,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,25-Aug,2005,436,7054,,,,,1107,1112,,10.1038/nature03930,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,958AK,WOS:000231416600035,16121171,No,,,11/20/17

Branches and branching patterns are produced by tissues called shoot apical meristems. Thus, inflorescence architecture reflects meristem number, arrangement and activity, and the duration of meristem activity correlates with branch length. The inflorescences of maize, unlike those of related grasses such as rice and sorghum, predominantly lack long branches, giving rise to the tassel and familiar corncob. Here we report the isolation of the maize ramosa1 gene and show that it controls inflorescence architecture. Through its expression in a boundary domain near the nascent meristem base, ramosa1 imposes short branch identity as branch meristems are initiated. A second gene, ramosa2, acts through ramosa1 by regulating ramosa1 gene expression levels. ramosa1 encodes a transcription factor that appears to be absent in rice, is heterochronically expressed in sorghum, and may have played an important role in maize domestication and grass evolution.","Cold Spring Harbor Lab, Cold Spring Harbor, NY 11724 USA; Cornell Univ, Dept Plant Breeding, Ithaca, NY 14850 USA","Martienssen, R (reprint author), Cold Spring Harbor Lab, POB 100, Cold Spring Harbor, NY 11724 USA.",martiens@cshl.org,,"Vollbrecht, Erik/0000-0003-4919-1365; Buckler, Edward/0000-0002-3100-371X",,,,42,148,178,2,34,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,25-Aug,2005,436,7054,,,,,1119,1126,,10.1038/nature03892,,8,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,958AK,WOS:000231416600037,16041362,No,,,11/20/17

Differentiated meteorites come from parent bodies that were once molten and separated into metal cores and silicate mantles. Mineral ages for these meteorites, however, are typically younger than age constraints for planetesimal differentiation(3-5). Such young ages indicate that the energy required to melt their parent bodies could not have come from the most likely heat source(6) - radioactive decay of short-lived nuclides (Al-26 and Fe-60) injected from a nearby supernova - because these would have largely decayed by the time of melting. Here we report an age of 4.5662 +/- 0.0001 billion years ( based on Pb - Pb dating) for basaltic angrites, which is only 1Myr younger than the currently accepted minimum age of the Solar System(7) and corresponds to a time when Al-26 and Fe-60 decay could have triggered planetesimal melting. Small Mg-26 excesses in bulk angrite samples confirm that Al-26 decay contributed to the melting of their parent body. These results indicate that the accretion of differentiated planetesimals pre-dated that of undifferentiated planetesimals, and reveals the minimum Solar System age to be 4.5695 +/- 0.0002 billion years.","Victoria Univ Wellington, Sch Earth Sci, Wellington, New Zealand; Inst Geol, DK-1350 Copenhagen, Denmark; Geol Museum, DK-1350 Copenhagen, Denmark; Univ Texas, Dept Geol Sci, Austin, TX 78712 USA","Baker, J (reprint author), Victoria Univ Wellington, Sch Earth Sci, POB 600, Wellington, New Zealand.",joel.baker@vuw.ac.nz,"; Baker, Joel/A-3477-2008; Connelly, James /O-7996-2015; Haack, Henning/A-4807-2013; Bizzarro, Martin/I-8701-2012","Baker, Joel/0000-0001-6371-5060; Haack, Henning/0000-0002-4618-3178; Bizzarro, Martin/0000-0001-9966-2124",,,,27,154,156,2,38,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,25-Aug,2005,436,7054,,,,,1127,1131,,10.1038/nature03882,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,958AK,WOS:000231416600038,16121173,No,,,11/20/17

No direct measurements of such meteoric 'smoke' have hitherto been made(3). Here we report the disintegration of one of the largest meteoroids to have entered the Earth's atmosphere during the past decade, and show that the dominant contribution to the mass of the residual atmospheric aerosol was in the form of micrometre-sized particles. This result is contrary to the usual view that most of the material in large meteoroids is efficiently converted to particles of much smaller size through ablation(4).

Ferroelectric crystals have a spontaneous electric polarization arising from the coherent arrangement of electric dipoles(1) ( specifically, a polar displacement of anions and cations). First-principles calculations(2,3) and electron density analysis(4) of ferroelectric materials have revealed that the covalent bond between the anions and cations, or the orbital hybridization of electrons on both ions, plays a key role in establishing the dipolar arrangement. However, an alternative model - electronic ferroelectricity(5) - has been proposed in which the electric dipole depends on electron correlations, rather than the covalency. This would offer the attractive possibility of ferroelectric materials that could be controlled by the charge, spin and orbital degrees of freedom of the electron. Here we report experimental evidence for ferroelectricity arising from electron correlations in the triangular mixed valence oxide, LuFe2O4. Using resonant X-ray scattering measurements, we determine the ordering of the Fe2+ and Fe3+ ions. They form a superstructure that supports an electric polarization consisting of distributed electrons of polar symmetry. The polar ordering arises from the repulsive property of electrons - electron correlations - acting on a frustrated geometry.","SPring8, Japan Synchrotron Radiat Res Inst, Mikazuki, Hyogo 6795198, Japan; Japan Atom Energy Res Inst, SPring8, Synchrotron Radiat Res Ctr, Mikazuki, Hyogo 6795148, Japan; Japan Atom Energy Res Inst, Ibaraki 3191195, Japan; Tohoku Univ, Dept Phys, Sendai, Miyagi 9808578, Japan; Osaka Prefecture Univ, Dept Phys Sci, Osaka 5998531, Japan; Natl Inst Adv Ind Sci & Technol, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058561, Japan","Ikeda, N (reprint author), SPring8, Japan Synchrotron Radiat Res Inst, Mikazuki, Hyogo 6795198, Japan.",ikedan@spring8.or.jp,"IKEDA, Naoshi/B-2587-2011",,,,,16,591,604,11,222,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,25-Aug,2005,436,7054,,,,,1136,1138,,10.1038/nature04039,,3,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,958AK,WOS:000231416600040,16121175,No,,,11/20/17

During this process, light absorption generates molecules in excited electronic states that are susceptible to accepting or donating electrons. But although the excited states are straightforward to generate, their short lifetimes makes it challenging to control electron transfer and subsequent product formation - particularly if enantiopure products are desired. Control strategies developed so far use hydrogen bonding, to embed photochemical substrates in chiral environments(3) and to render photochemical reactions enantioselective through the use of rigid chiral complexing agents(4). To go beyond such stoichiometric chiral information transmission, catalytic turnover is required(5). Here we present a catalytic photoinduced electron transfer reaction that proceeds with considerable turnover and high enantioselectivity. By using an electron accepting chiral organocatalyst that enforces a chiral environment on the substrate through hydrogen bonding, we obtain the product in significant enantiomeric excess ( up to 70%) and in yields reaching 64%.

In the past, considerable attention has been paid to excited base pairs(2). Recent reports have suggested that light-triggered motion of a proton in one of the hydrogen bonds of an isolated base pair initiates non-radiative decay to the electronic ground state(3,4). Here we show that vertical base stacking, and not base pairing, determines the fate of excited singlet electronic states in single- and double-stranded oligonucleotides composed of adenine ( A) and thymine ( T) bases.

Geochemical tracers also suggest a time lag between changes in submarine groundwater discharge rates(12,14) and the seasonal oscillations of inland recharge that drive groundwater flow towards the coast. Here we use measurements of hydraulic gradients and offshore fluxes taken at Waquoit Bay, Massachusetts, together with a modelling study of a generalized coastal groundwater system to show that a shift in the freshwater - saltwater interface - controlled by seasonal changes in water table elevation - can explain large saline discharges that lag inland recharge cycles. We find that sea water is drawn into aquifers as the freshwater - saltwater interface moves landward during winter, and discharges back into coastal waters as the interface moves seaward in summer.

Methane flux to the atmosphere depends strongly on the climate(3); however, by far the largest part of the methane formed in wetland ecosystems is recycled and does not reach the atmosphere(4,5). The biogeochemical controls on the efficient oxidation of methane are still poorly understood. Here we show that submerged Sphagnum mosses, the dominant plants in some of these habitats, consume methane through symbiosis with partly endophytic methanotrophic bacteria, leading to highly effective in situ methane recycling. Molecular probes revealed the presence of the bacteria in the hyaline cells of the plant and on stem leaves. Incubation with C-13-methane showed rapid in situ oxidation by these bacteria to carbon dioxide, which was subsequently fixed by Sphagnum, as shown by incorporation of C-13-methane into plant sterols. In this way, methane acts as a significant ( 10 - 15%) carbon source for Sphagnum. The symbiosis explains both the efficient recycling of methane and the high organic carbon burial in these wetland ecosystems.","Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Dept Aquat Ecol & Environm Biol, NL-6525 ED Nijmegen, Netherlands; Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Dept Microbiol, NL-6525 ED Nijmegen, Netherlands; Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Dept Plant Cell Biol, NL-6525 ED Nijmegen, Netherlands; Netherlands Inst Sea Res, Dept Marine Biogeochem & Toxicol, NL-1790 AB Den Burg, Netherlands","Smolders, AJP (reprint author), Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Dept Aquat Ecol & Environm Biol, Toernooiveld 1, NL-6525 ED Nijmegen, Netherlands.",a.smolders@science.ru.nl; damste@nioz.nl,"Jetten, Mike/B-8834-2011; Roelofs, Jan/C-1243-2011; Lamers, Leon/A-8718-2012; Schmid, Markus/D-2669-2012; Smolders, Alfons/H-2583-2012; Sinninghe Damste, Jaap/F-6128-2011; Op den Camp, Huub/F-5114-2011; Strous, Marc/B-4064-2017","Jetten, Mike/0000-0002-4691-7039; Lamers, Leon/0000-0003-3769-2154; Sinninghe Damste, Jaap/0000-0002-8683-1854; Op den Camp, Huub/0000-0003-1990-9030; Strous, Marc/0000-0001-9600-3828",,,,24,193,207,3,126,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,25-Aug,2005,436,7054,,,,,1153,1156,,10.1038/nature03802,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,958AK,WOS:000231416600045,16121180,No,,,11/20/17

However, the processes that determine the rate at which these services are supplied are only starting to be identified. Biodiversity influences the way in which ecosystems function(1), but the form of the relationship between bacterial biodiversity and functioning remains poorly understood. Here we describe a manipulative experiment that measured how biodiversity affects the functioning of communities containing up to 72 bacterial species constructed from a collection of naturally occurring culturable bacteria. The experimental design allowed us to manipulate large numbers of bacterial species selected at random from those that were culturable. We demonstrate that there is a decelerating relationship between community respiration and increasing bacterial diversity. We also show that both synergistic interactions among bacterial species and the composition of the bacterial community are important in determining the level of ecosystem functioning.","NERC, Ctr Ecol & Hydrol, Mol Microbial Ecol Grp, Oxford OX1 3SR, England; Univ Oxford, Dept Zool, Oxford OX1 3PS, England; St Peters Coll, Oxford, England; Univ Guelph, Dept Environm Biol, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada","Lilley, AK (reprint author), NERC, Ctr Ecol & Hydrol, Mol Microbial Ecol Grp, Mansfield Rd, Oxford OX1 3SR, England.",akl@ceh.ac.uk,"Newman, Jonathan/A-5932-2008; Turner, Sarah/K-4683-2012; Silverman, Bernard/K-6417-2012","Newman, Jonathan/0000-0003-3155-4084; Turner, Sarah/0000-0002-8937-6922; Silverman, Bernard/0000-0002-4059-2376; Bell, Thomas/0000-0002-2615-3932",,,,30,394,417,29,270,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,25-Aug,2005,436,7054,,,,,1157,1160,,10.1038/nature03891,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,958AK,WOS:000231416600046,16121181,No,,,11/20/17

The perception of pitch is not unique to humans and has been experimentally demonstrated in several animal species(2,3). Pitch is the subjective attribute of a sound's fundamental frequency (f(0)) that is determined by both the temporal regularity and average repetition rate of its acoustic waveform. Spectrally dissimilar sounds can have the same pitch if they share a common f(0). Even when the acoustic energy at f(0) is removed ('missing fundamental') the same pitch is still perceived(1). Despite its importance for hearing, how pitch is represented in the cerebral cortex is unknown. Here we show the existence of neurons in the auditory cortex of marmoset monkeys that respond to both pure tones and missing fundamental harmonic complex sounds with the same f(0), providing a neural correlate for pitch constancy(1). These pitch-selective neurons are located in a restricted low-frequency cortical region near the anterolateral border of the primary auditory cortex, and is consistent with the location of a pitch-selective area identified in recent imaging studies in humans(4,5).","Johns Hopkins Univ, Sch Med, Dept Biomed Engn, Lab Auditory Neurophysiol, Baltimore, MD 21025 USA","Bendor, D (reprint author), Johns Hopkins Univ, Sch Med, Dept Biomed Engn, Lab Auditory Neurophysiol, Baltimore, MD 21025 USA.",dbendor@bme.jhu.edu; xwang@bme.jhu.edu,,"Bendor, Daniel/0000-0001-6621-793X","NIDCD NIH HHS [F31 DC006528, R01 DC003180]",,,30,296,303,2,54,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,25-Aug,2005,436,7054,,,,,1161,1165,,10.1038/nature03867,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,958AK,WOS:000231416600047,16121182,No,,,11/20/17

Like memory, synaptic plasticity includes an early phase that depends on modification of pre-existing proteins, and a late phase that requires transcription and synthesis of new proteins(1,2). Activation of postsynaptic targets seems to trigger the transcription of plasticity-related genes. The new mRNAs are either translated in the soma or transported to synapses before translation. GCN2, a key protein kinase, regulates the initiation of translation. Here we report a unique feature of hippocampal slices from GCN2(-/-) mice: in CA1, a single 100-Hz train induces a strong and sustained long-termpotentiation ( late LTP or L-LTP), which is dependent on transcription and translation. In contrast, stimulation that elicits L-LTP in wild-type slices, such as four 100-Hz trains or forskolin, fails to evoke L-LTP in GCN2(-/-) slices. This aberrant synaptic plasticity is mirrored in the behaviour of GCN2(-/-) mice in the Morris water maze: after weak training, their spatial memory is enhanced, but it is impaired after more intense training. Activated GCN2 stimulates mRNA translation of ATF4, an antagonist of cyclic-AMP-response-element-binding protein ( CREB). Thus, in the hippocampus of GCN2(-/-) mice, the expression of ATF4 is reduced and CREB activity is increased. Our study provides genetic, physiological, behavioural and molecular evidence that GCN2 regulates synaptic plasticity, as well as learning and memory, through modulation of the ATF4/CREB pathway.","McGill Univ, Dept Biochem, Montreal, PQ H3G 1Y6, Canada; McGill Univ, McGill Canc Ctr, Montreal, PQ H3G 1Y6, Canada; McGill Univ, Dept Pharmacol & Therapeut, Montreal, PQ H3G 1Y6, Canada; McGill Univ, Dept Psychol, Montreal, PQ H3G 1Y6, Canada; McGill Univ, Dept Neurol & Neurosurg, Montreal, PQ H3G 1Y6, Canada; Univ Montreal, Ctr Rech Sci Neurol, Dept Physiol, Montreal, PQ H3C 3J7, Canada; NYU, Sch Med, Dept Med, Skirball Inst, New York, NY 10016 USA; NYU, Sch Med, Dept Cell Biol, New York, NY 10016 USA; NYU, Sch Med, Dept Pharmacol, New York, NY 10016 USA; Clin Res Inst Montreal, Biochem Neuroendocrinol Lab, Montreal, PQ H2W 1R7, Canada; RIKEN, Genom Sci Ctr, Tsurumi Ku, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2300045, Japan","Sonenberg, N (reprint author), McGill Univ, Dept Biochem, 3655 Drummond St, Montreal, PQ H3G 1Y6, Canada.",nahum.sonenberg@mcgill.ca,"Seidah, Nabil/I-3596-2013; Cuello, A.

Biofilms resist antibiotic treatment and contribute to bacterial persistence in chronic infections(1,2). Hence, the elucidation of the mechanisms by which biofilms are formed may assist in the treatment of chronic infections, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa in the airways of patients with cystic fibrosis(2). Here we show that subinhibitory concentrations of aminoglycoside antibiotics induce biofilm formation in P. aeruginosa and Escherichia coli. In P. aeruginosa, a gene, which we designated aminoglycoside response regulator (arr), was essential for this induction and contributed to biofilm-specific aminoglycoside resistance. The arr gene is predicted to encode an inner-membrane phosphodiesterase whose substrate is cyclic di-guanosine monophosphate (c-di-GMP) - a bacterial second messenger that regulates cell surface adhesiveness(3). We found that membranes from arr mutants had diminished c-di-GMP phosphodiesterase activity, and P. aeruginosa cells with a mutation changing a predicted catalytic residue of Arr were defective in their biofilm response to tobramycin. Furthermore, tobramycin-inducible biofilm formation was inhibited by exogenous GTP, which is known to inhibit c-di-GMP phosphodiesterase activity(4). Our results demonstrate that biofilm formation can be a specific, defensive reaction to the presence of antibiotics, and indicate that the molecular basis of this response includes alterations in the level of c-di-GMP.","Univ Washington, Dept Genome Sci, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; Univ Washington, Dept Pediat, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; Univ Washington, Dept Med, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; Univ Washington, Dept Microbiol, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; Rutgers State Univ, Dept Chem, Piscataway, NJ 08854 USA; Rutgers State Univ, Dept Biol Chem, Piscataway, NJ 08854 USA","Miller, SI (reprint author), Univ Washington, Dept Genome Sci, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.",millersi@u.washington.edu,,,NIAID NIH HHS [K08 AI066251],,,28,543,575,15,167,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,25-Aug,2005,436,7054,,,,,1171,1175,,10.1038/nature03912,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,958AK,WOS:000231416600049,16121184,No,,,11/20/17

Rop proteins ( Rho of plants, Rac-like and AtRac in Arabidopsis thaliana) belong to the Rho family of Ras-related GTP-binding proteins that turn on signalling pathways by switching from a GDP-bound inactive to a GTP-bound active conformation(4,5). Activation depends on guanine nucleotide exchange factors ( GEFs) that catalyse the otherwise slow GDP dissociation for subsequent GTP binding(6). Although numerous RhoGEFs exist in animals and yeasts(7), no Rop-specific GEFs have yet been identified in plants and so Rop activation has remained elusive(1-3,8). Here we describe a new family of RhoGEF proteins that are exclusive to plants. We define a unique domain within these RopGEFs, termed PRONE (plant-specific Rop nucleotide exchanger), which is exclusively active towards members of the Rop subfamily. It increases nucleotide dissociation from Rop more than a thousand-fold and forms a tight complex with nucleotide-free Rop. RopGEFs may represent the missing link in signal transduction from receptor kinases to Rops and their identification has implications for the evolution of the Rho molecular switch.","Max Planck Inst Mol Physiol, D-44227 Dortmund, Germany","Berken, A (reprint author), Max Planck Inst Mol Physiol, Otto Hahn Str 11, D-44227 Dortmund, Germany.",antje.berken@mpi-dortmund.mpg.de,,"Thomas, Christoph/0000-0001-7441-1089",,,,30,139,169,1,12,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,25-Aug,2005,436,7054,,,,,1176,1180,,10.1038/nature03883,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,958AK,WOS:000231416600050,15980860,No,,,11/20/17

The physical nature of these structures differs between mammalian species(2). Although Hassall's corpuscles have been proposed to act in both the removal of apoptotic thymocytes(3,4) and the maturation of developing thymocytes(5) within the thymus, the function of Hassall's corpuscles has remained an enigma. Here we report that human Hassall's corpuscles express thymic stromal lymphopoietin ( TSLP). Human TSLP activates thymic CD11c-positive dendritic cells to express high levels of CD80 and CD86. These TSLP-conditioned dendritic cells are then able to induce the proliferation and differentiation of CD4(+) CD8(-) CD25(-) thymic T cells into CD4(+) CD25(+) FOXP3(+) (forkhead box P3) regulatory T cells. This induction depends on peptide - major histocompatibility complex class II interactions, and the presence of CD80 and CD86, as well as interleukin 2. Immunohistochemistry studies reveal that CD25(+) CTLA4(+) (cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4) regulatory T cells associate in the thymic medulla with activated or mature dendritic cells and TSLP-expressing Hassall's corpuscles. These findings suggest that Hassall's corpuscles have a critical role in dendritic-cell-mediated secondary positive selection of medium-to-high affinity self-reactive T cells, leading to the generation of CD4(+) CD25(+) regulatory T cells within the thymus.","Univ Texas, MD Anderson Canc Ctr, Dept Immunol, Houston, TX 77054 USA; Univ Texas, MD Anderson Canc Ctr, Ctr Canc Immunol Res, Houston, TX 77054 USA","Liu, YJ (reprint author), Univ Texas, MD Anderson Canc Ctr, Dept Immunol, 7455 Fannin St, Houston, TX 77054 USA.",yjliu@mdanderson.org; yjliu@mdanderson.org,"Lee, Heung Kyu/C-2073-2011","Lee, Heung Kyu/0000-0002-3977-1510; Cao, Wei/0000-0002-8952-9159",,,,30,455,499,2,20,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,25-Aug,2005,436,7054,,,,,1181,1185,,10.1038/nature03886,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,958AK,WOS:000231416600051,16121185,No,,,11/20/17

Here we show that mouse and human NKG2D ligands are upregulated in non-tumour cell lines by genotoxic stress and stalled DNA replication, conditions known to activate a major DNA damage checkpoint pathway initiated by ATM ( ataxia telangiectasia, mutated) or ATR (ATM- and Rad3-related) protein kinases(2). Ligand upregulation was prevented by pharmacological or genetic inhibition of ATR, ATM or Chk1 ( a downstream transducer kinase in the pathway). Furthermore, constitutive ligand expression by a tumour cell line was inhibited by targeting short interfering RNA to ATM, suggesting that ligand expression in established tumour cells, which often harbour genomic irregularities, may be due to chronic activation of the DNA damage response pathway.

These studies suggest that the OFF state is achieved by an asymmetric, intramolecular interaction between the actin-binding region of one head and the converter region of the other, switching both heads off(3).

Notably, the toxin-bound beta TAD phosphates mimic the phosphate backbone of two nucleotides in a conformational switch of 18S rRNA, thereby achieving universal recognition of eEF2 by ETA.","Aarhus Univ, Ctr Struct Biol, Dept Mol Biol, DK-8000 Aarhus, Denmark; Univ Guelph, Dept Mol & Cellular Biol, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada; Univ Guelph, Dept Chem, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada; NCI, Med Chem Lab, Canc Res Ctr, NIH, Frederick, MD 21702 USA","Andersen, GR (reprint author), Aarhus Univ, Ctr Struct Biol, Dept Mol Biol, Gustav Wieds Vej 10C, DK-8000 Aarhus, Denmark.",rmerrill@uoguelph.ca; gra@mb.au.dk,"Jorgensen, Rene/P-5619-2014","Jorgensen, Rene/0000-0003-0672-466X; Andersen, Gregers Rom/0000-0001-6292-3319",,,,38,78,78,1,11,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,18-Aug,2005,436,7053,,,,,979,984,,10.1038/nature03871,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,955XQ,WOS:000231263900041,16107839,No,,,11/20/17

Inhomogeneities in the expanding flow result in internal shock waves that are believed to produce the gamma-rays we see(1,2). As the jet travels further outward into the surrounding circumstellar medium, 'external' shocks create the afterglow emission seen in the X-ray, optical and radio bands(1,2). Here we report observations of the early phases of the X-ray emission of five GRBs. Their X-ray light curves are characterised by a surprisingly rapid fall-off for the first few hundred seconds, followed by a less rapid decline lasting several hours. This steep decline, together with detailed spectral properties of two particular bursts, shows that violent shock interactions take place in the early jet outflows.","Osserv Astron Brera, INAF, I-23807 Merate, Italy; Univ Leicester, Dept Phys & Astron, Leicester LE1 7RH, Leics, England; Univ Milan Bicocca, I-20126 Milan, Italy; Penn State Univ, Dept Astron & Astrophys, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; ASI Sci Data Ctr, I-00044 Frascati, Italy; NASA, Goddard Space Flight Ctr, Greenbelt, MD 20771 USA; Univ Space Res Assoc, Columbia, MD 21044 USA; CNR, Washington, DC 20418 USA; Univ Texas, Dept Astron, Austin, TX 78712 USA; Univ Nevada, Dept Phys, Las Vegas, NV 89154 USA; Johns Hopkins Univ, Dept Phys & Astron, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA; Ist Astrofis Spaziale & Com, INAF, I-90146 Palermo, Italy; Osserv Astron Roma, INAF, I-00040 Monte Porzio Catone, Italy","Tagliaferri, G (reprint author), Osserv Astron Brera, INAF, Via Bianchi 46, I-23807 Merate, Italy.",tagliaferri@merate.mi.astro.it,"Gehrels, Neil/D-2971-2012; Barthelmy, Scott/D-2943-2012","moretti, alberto/0000-0002-9770-0315; Romano, Patrizia/0000-0003-0258-7469; giommi, paolo/0000-0002-2265-5003; Campana, Sergio/0000-0001-6278-1576; Cusumano, Giancarlo/0000-0002-8151-1990; Tagliaferri, Gianpiero/0000-0003-0121-0723; Covino, Stefano/0000-0001-9078-5507",,,,30,205,209,0,7,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,18-Aug,2005,436,7053,,,,,985,988,,10.1038/nature03934,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,955XQ,WOS:000231263900042,16107840,No,,,11/20/17

The ages of primitive chondrules(3-6) in chondritic meteorites indicate that their formation started shortly after that of the calcium-aluminium-rich inclusions (4,567.2 +/- 0.7 Myr ago) and lasted for about 3 Myr, which is consistent with the dissipation timescale for protoplanetary disks around young solar-mass stars(7). Here we report the Pb-207-Pb-206 ages of chondrules in the metal-rich CB (Bencubbin-like) carbonaceous chondrites Gujba (4,562.7 +/- 0.5 Myr) and Hammadah al Hamra 237 (4,562.8 +/- 0.9 Myr), which formed during a single-stage, highly energetic event(8-11). Both the relatively young ages and the single-stage formation of the CB chondrules are inconsistent with formation during a nebular shock wave(2). We conclude that chondrules and metal grains in the CB chondrites formed from a vapour-melt plume produced by a giant impact between planetary embryos after dust in the protoplanetary disk had largely dissipated. These findings therefore provide evidence for planet-sized objects in the earliest asteroid belt, as required by current numerical simulations of planet formation in the inner Solar System(12).","Univ Hawaii Manoa, Hawaii Inst Geophys & Planetol, Sch Ocean & Earth Sci & Technol, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; Geol Survey Canada, Ottawa, ON K1A 0E8, Canada; Univ Toronto, Dept Geol, Toronto, ON, Canada; SETI Inst, Mountain View, CA 94043 USA; Museum Natl Hist Nat, Lab Etud Mat Extraterr, USM 0205, F-75005 Paris, France","Krot, AN (reprint author), Univ Hawaii Manoa, Hawaii Inst Geophys & Planetol, Sch Ocean & Earth Sci & Technol, 2525 Correa Rd, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA.",sasha@higp.hawaii.edu,,,,,,30,158,158,2,19,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,18-Aug,2005,436,7053,,,,,989,992,,10.1038/nature03830,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,955XQ,WOS:000231263900043,16107841,No,,,11/20/17

Such quasicrystals can be constructed from two or more types of dielectric material arranged in a quasiperiodic pattern whose rotational symmetry is forbidden for periodic crystals (such as five-fold symmetry in the plane and icosahedral symmetry in three dimensions). Because quasicrystals have higher point group symmetry than ordinary crystals, their gap centre frequencies are closer and the gaps widths are more uniform-optimal conditions for forming a complete bandgap that is more closely spherically symmetric. Although previous studies have focused on one-dimensional and two-dimensional quasicrystals(4-7,) where exact (one-dimensional) or approximate (two-dimensional) band structures can be calculated numerically, analogous calculations for the three-dimensional case are computationally challenging and have not yet been performed. Here we circumvent the computational problem by doing an experiment. Using stereolithography, we construct a photonic quasicrystal with centimetre-scale cells and perform microwave transmission measurements. We show that three-dimensional icosahedral quasicrystals exhibit sizeable stop gaps and, despite their quasi-periodicity, yield uncomplicated spectra that allow us to experimentally determine the faces of their effective Brillouin zones.

The characteristic period of these defects is of the order of the wavelength of visible light, and they give rise to vivid specular reflections(2) that are controllable with external fields(3-8). Blue phases may be considered as examples of tuneable photonic crystals(9) with many potential applications. The disadvantage of these materials, as predicted theoretically and proved experimentally(1), is that they have limited thermal stability: they exist over a small temperature range (0.5-2 degrees C) between isotropic and chiral nematic (N*) thermotropic phases, which limits their practical applicability. Here we report a generic family of liquid crystals that demonstrate an unusually broad body-centred cubic phase (BPI*) from 60 degrees C down to 16 degrees C. We prove this with optical texture analysis, selective reflection spectroscopy, Kossel diagrams and differential scanning calorimetry, and show, using a simple polarizer-free electro-optic cell, that the reflected colour is switched reversibly in applied electric fields over a wide colour range in typically 10 ms. We propose that the unusual behaviour of these blue phase materials is due to their dimeric molecular structure and their very high flexoelectric coefficients. This in turn sets out new theoretical challenges and potentially opens up new photonic applications.","Univ Cambridge, Ctr Mol Mat Photon & Elect, Dept Engn, Cambridge CB2 1PZ, England","Coles, HJ (reprint author), Univ Cambridge, Ctr Mol Mat Photon & Elect, Dept Engn, Trumpington St, Cambridge CB2 1PZ, England.",hjc37@cam.ac.uk,,,,,,20,384,386,15,179,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,18-Aug,2005,436,7053,,,,,997,1000,,10.1038/nature03932,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,955XQ,WOS:000231263900045,16107843,No,,,11/20/17

The variability in hydroxyl radical concentrations on annual to monthly timescales, however, is difficult to quantify. Here we show records of carbon monoxide containing radiocarbon ((CO)-C-14), which is oxidized by hydroxyl radicals(4,5), from clean-air sites at Baring Head, New Zealand, and Scott Base, Antarctica, spanning 13 years. Using a model study, we correct for known variations in production of (CO)-C-14 (refs 6, 7), allowing us to exploit this species as a diagnostic for short term changes in hydroxyl radical concentrations. We find no significant long-term trend in hydroxyl radical concentrations but provide evidence for recurring short-term variations of around ten per cent persisting for a few months. We also find decreases in hydroxyl radical concentrations of up to 20 per cent, apparently triggered by the eruption of Mt Pinatubo in 1991 and by the occurrence of extensive fires in Indonesia in 1997.","IPCC Working Grp Support Unit 1, Boulder, CO 80305 USA; Natl Inst Water & Atmospher Res, Wellington 6003, New Zealand","Manning, MR (reprint author), IPCC Working Grp Support Unit 1, Boulder, CO 80305 USA.",Martin.Manning@noaa.gov,"Bodeker, Greg/A-8870-2008","Bodeker, Greg/0000-0003-1094-5852",,,,30,42,44,1,19,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,18-Aug,2005,436,7053,,,,,1001,1004,,10.1038/nature03900,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,955XQ,WOS:000231263900046,16107844,No,,,11/20/17

However, the osmium isotopic compositions of abyssal peridotites and MORB do not appear to be in equilibrium(1-8), raising questions about the cogenetic relationship between those two reservoirs. However, the cause of this isotopic mismatch is mainly due to a drastic filtering of the data based on the possibility of osmium contamination by sea water(5). Here we present a detailed study of magmatic sulphides ( the main carrier of osmium) in abyssal peridotites and show that the Os-187/Os-188 ratio of these sulphides is of primary mantle origin and can reach radiogenic values suggesting equilibrium with MORB. Thus, the effect of sea water on the osmium systematics of abyssal peridotites has been overestimated and consequently there is no true osmium isotopic gap between MORBs and abyssal peridotites.","Macquarie Univ, GEMOC ARC Natl Key Ctr, Sch Earth & Planetary Sci, N Ryde, NSW 2109, Australia; Open Univ, Dept Earth Sci, Milton Keynes MK7 6AA, Bucks, England; Univ Montpellier 2, Lab Tectonophys, ISTEEM,CNRS, UMR5560, F-34095 Montpellier, France; Museum Natl Hist Nat, Lab Mineral Meteorites Manteau, FREE 2456, CNRS, F-75005 Paris, France; Carnegie Inst Washington, Dept Terr Magnetism, Washington, DC 20015 USA","Alard, O (reprint author), Macquarie Univ, GEMOC ARC Natl Key Ctr, Sch Earth & Planetary Sci, N Ryde, NSW 2109, Australia.",o.alard@open.ac.uk,"GAU, geochemist/H-1985-2016; ALARD, Olivier/A-7128-2008; O'Reilly, Suzanne/A-1315-2008; Griffin, William L/F-7713-2011; ALARD, Olivier/R-7755-2016","ALARD, Olivier/0000-0002-0832-6625; O'Reilly, Suzanne/0000-0002-3883-5498; Griffin, William L/0000-0002-0980-2566; ALARD, Olivier/0000-0002-0832-6625",,,,31,129,139,1,32,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,18-Aug,2005,436,7053,,,,,1005,1008,,10.1038/nature03902,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,955XQ,WOS:000231263900047,16107845,No,,,11/20/17

In particular, the studied natural network of pseudotachylytes is consistent with a dominant propagation direction during repeated seismic events and subsonic rupture propagation close to the Rayleigh wave velocity.","Univ Padua, Dipartimento Geol Paleontol & Geofis, I-35137 Padua, Italy; Ist Nazl Geofis & Vulcanol, I-00143 Rome, Italy","Nielsen, S (reprint author), Univ Padua, Dipartimento Geol Paleontol & Geofis, I-35137 Padua, Italy.",snielsen@na.infn.it,"Nielsen, Stefan/F-6210-2011","Nielsen, Stefan/0000-0002-9214-2932; pennacchioni, giorgio/0000-0002-5956-5327",,,,30,78,78,1,19,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,18-Aug,2005,436,7053,,,,,1009,1012,,10.1038/nature03910,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,955XQ,WOS:000231263900048,16107846,No,,,11/20/17

Here we use a new global database on the breeding distribution of all known extant bird species to test for congruence across three types of hotspot. We demonstrate that hotspots of species richness, threat and endemism do not show the same geographical distribution. Only 2.5% of hotspot areas are common to all three aspects of diversity, with over 80% of hotspots being idiosyncratic. More generally, there is a surprisingly low overall congruence of biodiversity indices, with any one index explaining less than 24% of variation in the other indices.

This dynamic regulation manifests itself in axonal branching, turning and pathfinding, presynaptic differentiation, and growth cone collapse and extension. Semaphorin 3A (Sema3A), a secreted guidance cue that primarily functions to repel axons from inappropriate targets, induces cytoskeletal rearrangements that result in growth cone collapse(1). These effects require intra-axonal messenger RNA translation. Here we show that transcripts for RhoA, a small guanosine triphosphatase ( GTPase) that regulates the actin cytoskeleton, are localized to developing axons and growth cones, and this localization is mediated by an axonal targeting element located in the RhoA 30 untranslated region (UTR). Sema3A induces intra-axonal translation of RhoA mRNA, and this local translation of RhoA is necessary and sufficient for Sema3A-mediated growth cone collapse. These studies indicate that local RhoA translation regulates the neuronal cytoskeleton and identify a new mechanism for the regulation of RhoA signalling.","Cornell Univ, Dept Pharmacol, Weill Med Coll, New York, NY 10021 USA; Baylor Coll Med, Dept Neurosci, Houston, TX 77030 USA","Jaffrey, SR (reprint author), Cornell Univ, Dept Pharmacol, Weill Med Coll, New York, NY 10021 USA.",srj2003@med.cornell.edu,,"Hengst, Ulrich/0000-0002-8061-2861",NIMH NIH HHS [R01 MH066204]; NINDS NIH HHS [R01 NS056306],,,30,249,255,1,17,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,18-Aug,2005,436,7053,,,,,1020,1024,,10.1038/nature03885,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,955XQ,WOS:000231263900051,16107849,No,,,11/20/17

Heart failure is the second leading cause of fatalities in DMD1,2. Progress towards defining the molecular basis of disease in DMD has mostly come from studies on skeletal muscle, with comparatively little attention directed to cardiac muscle. The pathophysiological mechanisms involved in cardiac myocytes may differ significantly from skeletal myofibres; this is underscored by the presence of significant cardiac disease in patients with truncated or reduced levels of dystrophin but without skeletal muscle disease(3). Here we show that intact, isolated dystrophin-deficient cardiac myocytes have reduced compliance and increased susceptibility to stretch-mediated calcium overload, leading to cell contracture and death, and that application of the membrane sealant poloxamer 188 corrects these defects in vitro. In vivo administration of poloxamer 188 to dystrophic mice instantly improved ventricular geometry and blocked the development of acute cardiac failure during a dobutamine-mediated stress protocol. Once issues relating to optimal dosing and long-term effects of poloxamer 188 in humans have been resolved, chemical-based membrane sealants could represent a new therapeutic approach for preventing or reversing the progression of cardiomyopathy and heart failure in muscular dystrophy.","Univ Michigan, Dept Mol & Integrat Physiol, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; Univ Michigan, Dept Internal Med, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA","Metzger, JM (reprint author), Univ Michigan, Dept Mol & Integrat Physiol, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",metzgerj@umich.edu,,,,,,25,168,171,1,13,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,18-Aug,2005,436,7053,,,,,1025,1029,,10.1038/nature03844,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,955XQ,WOS:000231263900052,16025101,No,,,11/20/17

The Sertoli cell, the only somatic cell within seminiferous tubules, provides the stem cell niche through physical support and expression of surface proteins and soluble factors(2,3). Here we show that the Ets related molecule(4) (ERM) is expressed exclusively within Sertoli cells in the testis and is required for spermatogonial stem cell self-renewal. Mice with targeted disruption of ERM have a loss of maintenance of spermatogonial stem cell self-renewal without a block in normal spermatogenic differentiation and thus have progressive germ-cell depletion and a Sertoli-cell-only syndrome. Microarray analysis of primary Sertoli cells from ERM-deficient mice showed alterations in secreted factors known to regulate the haematopoietic stem cell niche. These results identify a new function for the Ets family transcription factors in spermatogenesis and provide an example of transcriptional control of a vertebrate stem cell niche.","Washington Univ, Sch Med, Dept Pathol & Immunol, St Louis, MO 63110 USA; Washington Univ, Sch Med, Howard Hughes Med Inst, St Louis, MO 63110 USA; Washington Univ, Sch Med, Dept Obstet & Gynecol, St Louis, MO 63110 USA; Genentech Inc, Dept Immunol, San Francisco, CA 94080 USA; Washington State Univ, Sch Mol Biosci, Pullman, WA 99164 USA; Univ Illinois, Dept Vet Biosci, Urbana, IL 61802 USA; Univ Texas, SW Med Sch, Cecil H & Ida Green Ctr Reprod Biol Sci, Dallas, TX 75390 USA; Univ Basel, Biozentrum, Dept Cell Biol, CH-4056 Basel, Switzerland; Friedrich Miescher Inst, CH-4058 Basel, Switzerland; McMaster Univ, Inst Mol Biol & Biotechnol, Hamilton, ON L8S 4K1, Canada; So Illinois Univ, Sch Med, Dept Physiol, Carbondale, IL 62901 USA; Univ Dayton, Dept Biol, Dayton, OH 45469 USA","Murphy, KM (reprint author), Washington Univ, Sch Med, Dept Pathol & Immunol, St Louis, MO 63110 USA.",murphy@pathbox.wustl.edu,"Lim, Hyunjung/D-5343-2011","Lim, Hyunjung/0000-0003-2191-666X; Ouyang, Wenjun/0000-0002-1811-5864; Chen, Chen/0000-0001-9159-4489","NICHD NIH HHS [K02 HD054607, R01 HD044543, R01 HD044543-02]",,,26,191,212,1,20,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,18-Aug,2005,436,7053,,,,,1030,1034,,10.1038/nature03894,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,955XQ,WOS:000231263900053,16107850,No,,,11/20/17

Here we show that the hypochromic anaemia in shiraz ( sir) zebrafish mutants is caused by deficiency of glutaredoxin 5 (grx5), a gene required in yeast for Fe - S cluster assembly. We found that grx5 was expressed in erythroid cells of zebrafish and mice. Zebrafish grx5 rescued the assembly of Delta grx5 yeast Fe - S, showing that the biochemical function of grx5 is evolutionarily conserved. In contrast to yeast, vertebrates use iron regulatory protein 1 (IRP1) to sense intracellular iron and regulate mRNA stability or the translation of iron metabolism genes(1,2). We found that loss of Fe - S cluster assembly in sir animals activated IRP1 and blocked haem biosynthesis catalysed by aminolaevulinate synthase 2 (ALAS2). Overexpression of ALAS2 RNA without the 50 iron response element that binds IRP1 rescued sir embryos, whereas overexpression of ALAS2 including the iron response element did not. Further, antisense knockdown of IRP1 restored sir embryo haemoglobin synthesis. These findings uncover a connection between haem biosynthesis and Fe - S clusters, indicating that haemoglobin production in the differentiating red cell is regulated through Fe - S cluster assembly.","Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Childrens Hosp, Stem Cell Program, Boston, MA 02115 USA; Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Childrens Hosp, Div Hematol Oncol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dana Farber Canc Inst, Boston, MA 02115 USA; Harvard Univ, Brigham & Womens Hosp, Sch Med, Div Hematol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; Univ Rochester, Dept Pediat, Med Ctr, Rochester, NY 14642 USA; Univ Utah, Dept Pathol, Sch Med, Salt Lake City, UT 84132 USA","Zon, LI (reprint author), Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Childrens Hosp, Stem Cell Program, Boston, MA 02115 USA.",zon@enders.tch.harvard.edu,,"Fraenkel, Paula/0000-0001-8894-0117; Maderspacher, Florian/0000-0003-4324-8455; Paw, Barry/0000-0002-0492-1419",,,,30,235,249,1,20,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,18-Aug,2005,436,7053,,,,,1035,1039,,10.1038/nature03887,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,955XQ,WOS:000231263900054,16110529,No,,,11/20/17

Plants and insects encode multiple Dicer enzymes that recognize distinct precursors of small RNAs and may act cooperatively(3-7). However, it is not known whether the single Dicer of worms and mammals is able to initiate the small RNA-guided RNA interference (RNAi) antiviral immunity as occurs in plants(8) and insects(9). Here we show complete replication of the Flock house virus (FHV) bipartite, plus-strand RNA genome in C. elegans. We show that FHV replication in C. elegans triggers potent antiviral silencing that requires RDE-1, an Argonaute protein(10,11) essential for RNAi mediated by small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) but not by microRNAs. This immunity system is capable of rapid virus clearance in the absence of FHV B2 protein, which acts as a broad-spectrum RNAi inhibitor(9,12) upstream of rde-1 by targeting the siRNA precursor. This work establishes a C. elegans model for genetic studies of animal virus - host interactions and indicates that mammals might use a siRNA pathway as an antiviral response.","Univ Calif Riverside, Inst Integrat Genome Biol, Riverside, CA 92521 USA; Univ Calif Riverside, Dept Plant Pathol, Riverside, CA 92521 USA; Univ Calif Riverside, Dept Biol, Riverside, CA 92521 USA; Univ Calif Riverside, Grad Program Microbiol, Riverside, CA 92521 USA","Ding, SW (reprint author), Univ Calif Riverside, Inst Integrat Genome Biol, Riverside, CA 92521 USA.",dingsw@ucr.edu,,,NIAID NIH HHS [R01 AI052447],,,28,254,264,2,23,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,18-Aug,2005,436,7053,,,,,1040,1043,,10.1038/nature03870,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,955XQ,WOS:000231263900055,16107851,No,,,11/20/17

RNAi has been postulated to function as an adaptive antiviral immune mechanism in the worm, but there is no experimental evidence for this. Part of the limitation is that there are no known natural viral pathogens of C. elegans. Here we describe an infection model in C. elegans using the mammalian pathogen vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) to study the role of RNAi in antiviral immunity. VSV infection is potentiated in cells derived from RNAi-defective worm mutants (rde-1; rde-4), leading to the production of infectious progeny virus, and is inhibited in mutants with an enhanced RNAi response (rrf-3; eri-1). Because the RNAi response occurs in the absence of exogenously added VSV small interfering RNAs, these results show that RNAi is activated during VSV infection and that RNAi is a genuine antiviral immune defence mechanism in the worm.","Univ Arkansas Med Sci, Dept Microbiol & Immunol, Little Rock, AR 72205 USA; Univ Arkansas Med Sci, Dept Physiol & Biophys, Little Rock, AR 72205 USA; Harding Univ, Dept Biol, Searcy, AR 72149 USA; Univ Tennessee, Dept Mol Sci, Hlth Sci Ctr, Memphis, TN 38163 USA","Chow, M (reprint author), Univ Arkansas Med Sci, Dept Microbiol & Immunol, Little Rock, AR 72205 USA.",chowmarie@uams.edu; kamachaca@uams.edu,,"Wilkins, Courtney/0000-0003-4001-7686; Machaca, Khaled/0000-0001-6215-2411",,,,28,199,224,1,16,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,18-Aug,2005,436,7053,,,,,1044,1047,,10.1038/nature03957,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,955XQ,WOS:000231263900056,16107852,No,,,11/20/17

In normal tissues, TERT is expressed in stem cells and in progenitor cells(3), but its role in these compartments is not fully understood. Here we show that conditional transgenic induction of TERT in mouse skin epithelium causes a rapid transition from telogen ( the resting phase of the hair follicle cycle) to anagen ( the active phase), thereby facilitating robust hair growth. TERT overexpression promotes this developmental transition by causing proliferation of quiescent, multipotent stem cells in the hair follicle bulge region. This new function for TERT does not require the telomerase RNA component, which encodes the template for telomere addition, and therefore operates through a mechanism independent of its activity in synthesizing telomere repeats. These data indicate that, in addition to its established role in extending telomeres, TERT can promote proliferation of resting stem cells through a non-canonical pathway.","Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Dept Med, Div Hematol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Canc Biol Program, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Dept Genet, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Dept Dermatol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA","Artandi, SE (reprint author), Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Dept Med, Div Hematol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",sartandi@stanford.edu,,,"NCI NIH HHS [K08 CA082176, R55 CA109088]; NIGMS NIH HHS [T32 GM007365]",,,30,276,299,0,18,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,18-Aug,2005,436,7053,,,,,1048,1052,,10.1038/nature03836,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,955XQ,WOS:000231263900057,16107853,No,,,11/20/17

The Spo11 protein must be removed for the DSB to be repaired, but the mechanism for removal is unclear(3). Here we show that meiotic DSBs in budding yeast are processed by endonucleolytic cleavage that releases Spo11 attached to an oligonucleotide with a free 3'-OH. Two discrete Spo11-oligonucleotide complexes were found in equal amounts, differing with respect to the length of the bound DNA. We propose that these forms arise from different spacings of strand cleavages flanking the DSB, with every DSB processed asymmetrically. Thus, the ends of a single DSB may be biochemically distinct at or before the initial processing step - much earlier than previously thought. SPO11- oligonucleotide complexes were identified in extracts of mouse testis, indicating that this mechanism is evolutionarily conserved. Oligonucleotide - topoisomerase II complexes were also present in extracts of vegetative yeast, although not subject to the same genetic control as for generating Spo11 - oligonucleotide complexes.

Here we present a map-based, finished quality sequence that covers 95% of the 389 Mb genome, including virtually all of the euchromatin and two complete centromeres. A total of 37,544 non-transposable-element-related protein-coding genes were identified, of which 71% had a putative homologue in Arabidopsis. In a reciprocal analysis, 90% of the Arabidopsis proteins had a putative homologue in the predicted rice proteome. Twenty-nine per cent of the 37,544 predicted genes appear in clustered gene families. The number and classes of transposable elements found in the rice genome are consistent with the expansion of syntenic regions in the maize and sorghum genomes. We find evidence for widespread and recurrent gene transfer from the organelles to the nuclear chromosomes. The map-based sequence has proven useful for the identification of genes underlying agronomic traits. The additional single-nucleotide polymorphisms and simple sequence repeats identified in our study should accelerate improvements in rice production.","Natl Inst Agrobiol Sci, Inst Soc Techno Innovat Agr Forestry & Fisheries, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058602, Japan; Inst Genome Res, Rockville, MD 20850 USA; Chinese Acad Sci, Shanghai Inst Biol Sci, Shanghai 200233, Peoples R China; Ctr Natl Sequencage, INRA URGV, CNRS UMR 8030, F-91057 Evry, France; UMR PIA, Cirad Amis, F-34398 Montpellier 05, France; Univ Arizona, Dept Plant Sci, BIO5 Inst, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA; Cold Spring Harbor Lab, Cold Spring Harbor, NY 11723 USA; Acad Sinica, Inst Bot, Taipei 11529, Taiwan; Natl Cheng Kung Univ, Tainan 701, Taiwan; Natl Yang Ming Univ, Taipei 112, Taiwan; Univ Delhi, Dept Plant Mol Biol, New Delhi 110021, India; Indian Agr Res Inst, Natl Res Ctr Plant Biotechnol, New Delhi 110012, India; Rutgers State Univ, Waksman Inst, Piscataway, NJ 08854 USA; Natl Inst Agr Sci & Technol, RDA, Suwon 441707, South Korea; Kasetsart Univ, Rice Gene Unit, Nakron Pathom 73140, Thailand; Univ Fed Pelotas, Ctr Genom & Fitomelhoramento, BR-96001970 Pelotas, RS, Brazil; John Innes Ctr Plant Sci Res, Norwich NR4 7UH, Norfolk, England; Washington Univ, Genome Sequencing Ctr, St Louis, MO 63108 USA; Univ Wisconsin, Dept Hort, Madison, WI 53706 USA; Univ Wisconsin, Dept Plant Pathol, Madison, WI 53706 USA; Natl Inst Genet, Ctr Informat Biol, Mishima, Shizuoka 4118540, Japan; Natl Inst Genet, DNA Data Bank Japan, Mishima, Shizuoka 4118540, Japan; Natl Inst Adv Ind Sci & Technol, Biol Informat Res Ctr, Koto Ku, Tokyo 1350064, Japan; Natl Inst Agrobiol Sci, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058602, Japan; Natl Inst Adv Ind Sci & Technol, Inst Med Res, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo 1138510, Japan; Japan Biol informat Consortium, Japan Biol Informat Res Ctr, Koto Ku, Tokyo 1350064, Japan; Cornell Univ, Dept Plant Breeding, Ithaca, NY 14850 USA; McGill Univ, Dept Biol, Montreal, PQ H3A 1B1, Canada; York Univ, Dept Biol, Toronto, ON M3J 1P3, Canada; Int Rice Res Inst, Biometr & Bioinformat Unit, Manila, Philippines; Nagoya City Univ, Grad Sch Nat Sci, Nagoya, Aichi 4678501, Japan; Brookhaven Natl Lab, Dept Biol, Upton, NY 11973 USA","Sasaki, T (reprint author), Natl Inst Agrobiol Sci, Inst Soc Techno Innovat Agr Forestry & Fisheries, 2-1-2 Kannondai, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058602, Japan.",tsasaki@nias.affrc.go.jp,"; LIN, Yao-Cheng/B-4394-2008; Wright, Stephen/C-3113-2008; Jiang, Jiming/A-9614-2009; Dellagostin, Odir/C-2331-2009; TYAGI, AKHILESH KUMAR/D-2649-2009; Leong, Sally /I-8550-2012; Song, Rentao/A-6544-2012; Vydianathan, Ravi/B-2759-2009; Oliveira, Antonio/F-7508-2012","Itoh, Takeshi/0000-0002-6291-4233; Wing, Rod/0000-0001-6633-6226; Quetier, Francis/0000-0003-4388-9287; LIN, Yao-Cheng/0000-0002-9390-795X; Wright, Stephen/0000-0001-9973-9697; Jiang, Jiming/0000-0002-6435-6140; Dellagostin, Odir/0000-0003-2803-4088; Song, Rentao/0000-0003-1810-9875; Vydianathan, Ravi/0000-0003-0807-7697; Oliveira, Antonio/0000-0001-8835-8071",,,,50,1972,5103,27,382,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,11-Aug,2005,436,7052,,,,,793,800,,10.1038/nature03895,,8,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,953XG,WOS:000231116500034,,No,,,11/20/17

Here we report that two common mutant MYC alleles derived from human Burkitt's lymphoma uncouple proliferation from apoptosis and, as a result, are more effective than wild-type MYC at promoting B cell lymphomagenesis in mice. Mutant MYC proteins retain their ability to stimulate proliferation and activate p53, but are defective at promoting apoptosis due to a failure to induce the BH3-only protein Bim ( a member of the B cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl2) family) and effectively inhibit Bcl2. Disruption of apoptosis through enforced expression of Bcl2, or loss of either Bim or p53 function, enables wild-type MYC to produce lymphomas as efficiently as mutant MYC. These data show how parallel apoptotic pathways act together to suppress MYC-induced transformation, and how mutant MYC proteins, by selectively disabling a p53-independent pathway, enable tumour cells to evade p53 action during lymphomagenesis.","Cold Spring Harbor Lab, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Cold Spring Harbor, NY 11724 USA; Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Dept Pathol, New York, NY 10021 USA; St Jude Childrens Res Hosp, Dept Biochem, Memphis, TN 38105 USA","Lowe, SW (reprint author), Cold Spring Harbor Lab, Howard Hughes Med Inst, 1 Bungtown Rd, Cold Spring Harbor, NY 11724 USA.",lowe@cshl.org,"Nilsson, Jonas/E-5346-2013",,"NCI NIH HHS [P30 CA008748, P01 CA087497]",,,30,263,274,2,6,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,11-Aug,2005,436,7052,,,,,807,811,,10.1038/nature03845,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,953XG,WOS:000231116500036,16094360,No,,,11/20/17

Here we investigate chromosome congression during the first meiotic division in starfish oocytes. We show that microtubules are not sufficient for capturing chromosomes. Instead, chromosome congression requires actin polymerization. After nuclear envelope breakdown, we observe the formation of a filamentous actin mesh in the nuclear region, and find that contraction of this network delivers chromosomes to the microtubule spindle. We show that this mechanism is essential for preventing chromosome loss and aneuploidy of the egg - a leading cause of pregnancy loss and birth defects in humans.","European Mol Biol Lab, Gene Express & Cell Biol Programme, D-69117 Heidelberg, Germany; European Mol Biol Lab, Biophys Programme, D-69117 Heidelberg, Germany; German Canc Res Ctr, D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany; Univ Connecticut, Ctr Hlth, Dept Orthodont, Farmington, CT 06030 USA; Univ Connecticut, Ctr Hlth, Dept Oral & Maxillofacial Surg, Farmington, CT 06030 USA; Univ Connecticut, Ctr Hlth, Dept Pediat Dent, Farmington, CT 06030 USA; Univ Connecticut, Ctr Hlth, Dept Adv Gen Dent, Farmington, CT 06030 USA; Univ Connecticut, Ctr Hlth, Dept Physiol, Farmington, CT 06030 USA; Marine Biol Lab, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA","Ellenberg, J (reprint author), European Mol Biol Lab, Gene Express & Cell Biol Programme, Meyerhofstr 1, D-69117 Heidelberg, Germany.",jan.ellenberg@embl.de,"Ellenberg, Jan/I-4688-2014; Eils, Roland/B-6121-2009","Ellenberg, Jan/0000-0001-5909-701X; Eils, Roland/0000-0002-0034-4036; Lenart, Peter/0000-0002-3927-248X",,,,40,137,139,0,10,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,11-Aug,2005,436,7052,,,,,812,818,,10.1038/nature03810,,7,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,953XG,WOS:000231116500037,16015286,No,,,11/20/17

Here we show that the 10-solar-mass (10 M(.)) black hole in the X-ray binary Cygnus X-1 (refs 3 - 5) is surrounded by a large-scale (similar to 5 pc in diameter) ring-like structure that appears to be inflated by the inner radio jet(6). We estimate that in order to sustain the observed emission of the ring, the jet of Cygnus X-1 has to carry a kinetic power that can be as high as the bolometric X-ray luminosity of the binary system.

Using the orbital information to estimate its mass and density, 87 Sylvia appears to have a rubble-pile structure with a porosity of 25 - 60 per cent.

Vortex motion in fluids and magnetized plasmas is typically governed by nonlinear equations(2-5), examples of which include the Navier - Stokes equation(1,2), the Charney - Hasegawa - Mima equations(2-5) and their numerous generalizations(6-9). These nonlinear equations admit solutions(2-5) in the form of different types of vortices that are frequently observed in a variety of contexts: in atmospheres, in oceans and planetary systems(2,4), in the heliosphere(10,11), in the Earth's ionosphere and magnetosphere(12-17), and in laboratory plasma experiments(18).

Antiferromagnetism is established as the competing order(1,2), but the relationship between the two states in the intervening 'pseudogap' regime has become a central puzzle(3). The role of the crystal lattice, which is important in conventional superconductors, also remains unclear. Here we report an anomalous increase of the distance between copper oxide planes on cooling, which results in negative thermal volume expansion, for layered ruthenium copper oxides(4,5) that have been doped to the boundary of antiferromagnetism and superconductivity. We propose that a crossover between these states is driven by spin ordering in the ruthenium oxide layers, revealing a novel mechanism for negative lattice expansion in solids. The differences in volume and lattice strain between the distinct superconducting and antiferromagnetic states can account for the phase segregation phenomena found extensively in low-doped copper oxides, and show that Cooper pair formation is coupled to the lattice. Unusually large variations of resistivity with magnetic field are found in these ruthenium copper oxides at low temperatures through coupling between the ordered Ru and Cu spins.","Univ Edinburgh, Ctr Sci Extreme Condit, Edinburgh EH9 3JZ, Midlothian, Scotland; Univ Aberdeen, Dept Chem, Aberdeen AB24 3UE, Scotland; Univ Edinburgh, Sch Chem, Edinburgh EH9 3JZ, Midlothian, Scotland; Univ Cambridge, Dept Chem, Cambridge CB2 1EW, England; PIEAS, Dept Chem & Mat Engn, Nilore, Islamabad, Pakistan","Attfield, JP (reprint author), Univ Edinburgh, Ctr Sci Extreme Condit, Kings Bldg,Mayfield Rd, Edinburgh EH9 3JZ, Midlothian, Scotland.",j.p.attfield@ed.ac.uk,"sher, Falak/G-3412-2015","Mclaughlin, Abbie/0000-0001-9960-723X",,,,30,33,33,3,36,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,11-Aug,2005,436,7052,,,,,829,832,,10.1038/nature03828,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,953XG,WOS:000231116500041,16094364,No,,,11/20/17

A recent ice core from Greenland demonstrates climate cooling from 122,000 years ago(3) driven by orbitally controlled insolation, with glacial inception at 118,000 years ago(4-8). Here we present an annually resolved, layer-counted record of varve thickness, quartz grain size and pollen assemblages from a maar lake in the Eifel ( Germany), which documents a late Eemian aridity pulse lasting 468 years with dust storms, aridity, bushfire and a decline of thermophilous trees at the time of glacial inception. We interpret the decrease in both precipitation and temperature as an indication of a close link of this extreme climate event to a sudden southward shift of the position of the North Atlantic drift, the ocean current that brings warm surface waters to the northern European region. The late Eemian aridity pulse occurred at a 65 degrees N July insolation of 416 W m(-2), close to today's value of 428 W m(-2) ( ref. 9), and may therefore be relevant for the interpretation of present-day climate variability.","Univ Mainz, Inst Geosci, D-55099 Mainz, Germany; Saxon Acad Sci Leipzig, D-09596 Freiberg, Germany","Sirocko, F (reprint author), Univ Mainz, Inst Geosci, D-55099 Mainz, Germany.",sirocko@uni-mainz.de,,,,,,29,89,90,1,18,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,11-Aug,2005,436,7052,,,,,833,836,,10.1038/nature03905,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,953XG,WOS:000231116500042,16094365,No,,,11/20/17

The shield volcanoes of the Hawaiian islands are distributed in two curvilinear, parallel trends ( termed 'Kea' and 'Loa'), whose rocks are characterized by general geochemical differences(2-5). This has led to the proposition that Hawaiian volcanoes sample compositionally distinct, concentrically zoned, regions of the underlying mantle plume(4,5). Melt inclusions, or samples of local magma 'frozen' in olivine phenocrysts during crystallization, may record complexities of mantle sources(6), thereby providing better insight into the chemical structure of plumes. Here we report the discovery of both Kea- and Loa-like major and trace element compositions in olivine-hosted melt inclusions in individual, shield-stage Hawaiian volcanoes - even within single rock samples. We infer from these data that one mantle source component may dominate a single lava flow, but that the two mantle source components are consistently represented to some extent in all lavas, regardless of the specific geographic location of the volcano. We therefore suggest that the Hawaiian mantle plume is unlikely to be compositionally concentrically zoned. Instead, the observed chemical variation is probably controlled by the thermal structure of the plume.","Tokyo Inst Technol, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, Meguro Ku, Tokyo 1528551, Japan; Japan Agcy Marine Earth Sci & Technol, Inst Frontier Res Earth Evolut, Kanagawa 2370061, Japan","Ren, ZY (reprint author), Tokyo Inst Technol, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, Meguro Ku, 2-12-1 Ookayama, Tokyo 1528551, Japan.",zyren@jamstec.go.jp,"HIRANO, NAOTO/F-6009-2016; Takahashi, Eiichi/B-4883-2017","HIRANO, NAOTO/0000-0003-3491-0312; Takahashi, Eiichi/0000-0002-6500-1827; Hirano, Naoto/0000-0003-0980-3929",,,,33,66,74,2,32,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,11-Aug,2005,436,7052,,,,,837,840,,10.1038/nature03907,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,953XG,WOS:000231116500043,16100780,No,,,11/20/17

The seismogenic portion of the plate interface is mostly offshore and is currently locked, as inferred from geodetic data(4-6). However, episodic surface displacements - in the direction opposite to the long-term deformation motions caused by relative plate convergence across a locked interface - are observed about every 14 months with an unusual tremor-like seismic signature(7-9). Here we show that these tremors are distributed over a depth range exceeding 40 km within a limited horizontal band. Many occurred within or close to the strong seismic reflectors above the plate interface where local earthquakes are absent, suggesting that the seismogenic process for tremors is fluid-related. The observed depth range implies that tremors could be associated with the variation of stress field induced by a transient slip along the deeper portion of the Cascadia interface or, alternatively, that episodic slip is more diffuse than originally suggested.","Geol Survey Canada, Pacific Geosci Ctr, Sidney, BC V8L 1B9, Canada","Kao, H (reprint author), Geol Survey Canada, Pacific Geosci Ctr, 9860 W Saanich Rd, Sidney, BC V8L 1B9, Canada.",hkao@nrcan.gc.ca,,,,,,30,136,141,2,11,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,11-Aug,2005,436,7052,,,,,841,844,,10.1038/nature03903,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,953XG,WOS:000231116500044,16094366,No,,,11/20/17

This tolerance allows increased alcohol consumption, which over time leads to physical dependence and possibly addiction(1-3). Previous studies have shown that Drosophila develop ethanol tolerance, with kinetics of acquisition and dissipation that mimic those seen in mammals. This tolerance requires the catecholamine octopamine, the functional analogue of mammalian noradrenaline(4). Here we describe a new gene, hangover, which is required for normal development of ethanol tolerance. hangover flies are also defective in responses to environmental stressors, such as heat and the free-radical-generating agent paraquat. Using genetic epistasis tests, we show that ethanol tolerance in Drosophila relies on two distinct molecular pathways: a cellular stress pathway defined by hangover, and a parallel pathway requiring octopamine. hangover encodes a large nuclear zinc-finger protein, suggesting a role in nucleic acid binding. There is growing recognition that stress, at both the cellular and systemic levels, contributes to drug- and addiction-related behaviours in mammals. Our studies suggest that this role may be conserved across evolution.","Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Anat, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; Univ Calif San Francisco, Program Neurosci, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; Univ Wurzburg, Biozentrum, D-97074 Wurzburg, Germany","Scholz, H (reprint author), Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Anat, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA.",henrike.scholz@biozentrum.uni-wuerzburg.de; ulrike@itsa.ucsf.edu,,,NIAAA NIH HHS [R01 AA010035],,,23,73,75,1,30,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,11-Aug,2005,436,7052,,,,,845,847,,10.1038/nature03864,,3,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,953XG,WOS:000231116500045,16094367,No,,,11/20/17

Voltage-gated potassium (Kv) channels are homotetramers with each subunit constructed from six transmembrane segments, S1 - S6 (ref. 2). The voltage-sensing domain ( segments S1 - S4) contains charged arginine residues on S4 that move across the membrane electric field(2,3), modulating channel open probability. Understanding the physical movements of this voltage sensor is of fundamental importance and is the subject of controversy. Recently, the crystal structure of the KvAP(4) channel motivated an unconventional 'paddle model' of S4 charge movement, indicating that the segments S3b and S4 might move as a unit through the lipid bilayer with a large ( 15-20-angstrom) transmembrane displacement(5). Here we show that the voltage-sensor segments do not undergo significant transmembrane translation. We tested the movement of these segments in functional Shaker K 1 channels by using luminescence resonance energy transfer to measure distances between the voltage sensors and a pore-bound scorpion toxin. Our results are consistent with a 2-angstrom vertical displacement of S4, not the large excursion predicted by the paddle model. This small movement supports an alternative model in which the protein shapes the electric field profile, focusing it across a narrow region of S4 ( ref. 6).","Univ Illinois, Dept Phys, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; Univ Illinois, Ctr Biophys, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; Brandeis Univ, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Dept Biochem, Waltham, MA 02454 USA; Univ Calif Los Angeles, Sch Med, Dept Physiol, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; Univ Calif Los Angeles, Sch Med, Dept Anesthesiol, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA","Selvin, PR (reprint author), Univ Illinois, Dept Phys, 1110 W Green St, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.",selvin@uiuc.edu,,,"NIGMS NIH HHS [R01 GM030376, R37 GM030376, R01 GM074770]",,,28,138,141,2,26,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,11-Aug,2005,436,7052,,,,,848,851,,10.1038/nature03819,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,953XG,WOS:000231116500046,16094368,No,,,11/20/17

The fourth transmembrane helix (S4) in voltage-gated channels is the primary voltage-sensing unit that mediates the response to a changing membrane electric field(1,2). The molecular mechanism of voltage sensing, particularly with respect to the magnitude of the transmembrane movement of S4, remains controversial(3-5). To determine the extent of this transmembrane movement, we use fluorescent resonance energy transfer between the S4 domain and a reference point in the lipid bilayer. The lipophilic ion dipicrylamine distributes on either side of the lipid bilayer depending on the membrane potential, and is used here as a resonance-energy-transfer acceptor from donor molecules attached to several positions in the Shaker K+ channel. A voltage-driven transmembrane movement of the donor should produce a transient fluorescence change because the acceptor also translocates as a function of voltage. In Shaker K+ channels no such transient fluorescence is observed, indicating that the S4 segment does not translocate across the lipid bilayer. Based on these observations, we propose a molecular model of voltage gating that can account for the observed 13e gating charge with limited transmembrane S4 movement.","Univ Calif Los Angeles, David Geffen Sch Med, Dept Physiol, Los Angeles, CA 90025 USA; Univ Calif Los Angeles, David Geffen Sch Med, Dept Anesthesiol, Los Angeles, CA 90025 USA; Cornell Univ, Weill Med Coll, Dept Physiol & Biophys, New York, NY 10021 USA; Ctr Estudios Cient, Valdivia, Chile","Bezanilla, F (reprint author), Univ Calif Los Angeles, David Geffen Sch Med, Dept Physiol, 650 Charles E Young Dr S, Los Angeles, CA 90025 USA.",fbezanil@ucla.edu,"Blunck, Rikard/L-4226-2013","Blunck, Rikard/0000-0003-4484-2907; Chanda, Baron/0000-0003-4954-7034",,,,31,182,186,1,32,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,11-Aug,2005,436,7052,,,,,852,856,,10.1038/nature03888,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,953XG,WOS:000231116500047,16094369,No,,,11/20/17

Hanatoxin is a tarantula toxin that inhibits Kv channels by binding to voltage-sensor paddles(1-5), crucial helix-turn-helix motifs within the voltage-sensing domains that are composed of S3b and S4 helices(6). The active surface of the toxin is amphipathic(7,8), and related toxins have been shown to partition into membranes(9-12), raising the possibility that the toxin is concentrated in the membrane and interacts only weakly and transiently with the voltage sensors. Here we examine the kinetics and state dependence of the toxin - channel interaction and the physical location of the toxin in the membrane. We find that hanatoxin forms a strong and stable complex with the voltage sensors, far outlasting fluctuations of the voltage sensors between resting ( closed) conformations at negative voltages and activated ( open) conformations at positive voltages. Toxin affinity is reduced by voltage-sensor activation, explaining why the toxin stabilizes the resting conformation. We also find that when hanatoxin partitions into membranes it is localized to an interfacial region, with Trp 30 positioned about 8.5 angstrom from the centre of the bilayer. These results demonstrate that voltage-sensor paddles activate with a toxin as cargo, and suggest that the paddles traverse no more than the outer half of the bilayer during activation.","Natl Inst Neurol Disorders & Stroke, Mol Physiol & Biophys Sect, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; Natl Inst Neurol Disorders & Stroke, Membrane Transport Biophys Unit, Porter Neurosci Res Ctr, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; Gwangju Inst Sci & Technol, Dept Life Sci, Kwangju 500712, South Korea","Swartz, KJ (reprint author), Natl Inst Neurol Disorders & Stroke, Mol Physiol & Biophys Sect, NIH, 35 Convent Dr,MSC 3701, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA.",swartzk@ninds.nih.gov,,"Mindell, Joseph/0000-0002-6952-8247",Intramural NIH HHS [ZIA NS002945-13],,,30,132,138,1,11,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,11-Aug,2005,436,7052,,,,,857,860,,10.1038/nature03873,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,953XG,WOS:000231116500048,16094370,No,,,11/20/17

The first two cell divisions of Caenorhabditis elegans embryogenesis constitute an ideal test bed for a system-level approach. Early embryogenesis, including processes such as cell division and establishment of cellular polarity, is readily amenable to large-scale functional analysis. A first step toward a system-level understanding is to provide 'first-draft' models both of the molecular assemblies involved(1) and of the functional connections between them. Here we show that such models can be derived from an integrated gene/protein network generated from three different types of functional relationship(2): protein interaction(3), expression profiling similarity(4) and phenotypic profiling similarity(5), as estimated from detailed early embryonic RNA interference phenotypes systematically recorded for hundreds of early embryogenesis genes(6). The topology of the integrated network suggests that C. elegans early embryogenesis is achieved through coordination of a limited set of molecular machines. We assessed the overall predictive value of such molecular machine models by dynamic localization of ten previously uncharacterized proteins within the living embryo.","NYU, Dept Biol, Ctr Comparat Funct Genom, New York, NY 10003 USA; Dana Farber Canc Inst, Ctr Canc Syst Biol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; Dana Farber Canc Inst, Dept Canc Biol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Genet, Boston, MA 02115 USA; Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Biol Chem & Mol Pharmacol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; Max Planck Inst Mol Cell Biol & Genet, D-01307 Dresden, Germany; Cenix Biosci GmbH, D-01307 Dresden, Germany","Roth, FP (reprint author), NYU, Dept Biol, Ctr Comparat Funct Genom, New York, NY 10003 USA.",fritz_roth@hms.harvard.edu; marc_vidal@dfci.harvard.edu; fp1@nyu.edu,"Bertin, Nicolas/C-3025-2008; Roth, Frederick/H-6308-2011; Hyman, Anthony/B-3917-2017","Bertin, Nicolas/0000-0002-9835-9606; Hyman, Anthony/0000-0003-3664-154X; Chuang, Ling-shiang/0000-0001-5054-1305; Roth, Frederick/0000-0002-6628-649X",,,,30,182,213,2,17,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,11-Aug,2005,436,7052,,,,,861,865,,10.1038/nature03876,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,953XG,WOS:000231116500049,16094371,No,,,11/20/17

In the many parts of the world where water is in short supply, plant transpiration efficiency, the ratio of carbon fixation to water loss, is critical to plant survival, crop yield and vegetation dynamics(1). When challenged by variations in their environment, plants often seem to coordinate photosynthesis and transpiration(2), but significant genetic variation in transpiration efficiency has been identified both between and within species(3,4). This has allowed plant breeders to develop effective selection programmes for the improved transpiration efficiency of crops(5), after it was demonstrated that carbon isotopic discrimination, Delta, of plant matter was a reliable and sensitive marker negatively related to variation in transpiration efficiency(3,4,6). However, little is known of the genetic controls of transpiration efficiency. Here we report the isolation of a gene that regulates transpiration efficiency, ERECTA. We show that ERECTA, a putative leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinase (LRR-RLK)(7,8) known for its effects on inflorescence development(7,9), is a major contributor to a locus for Delta on Arabidopsis chromosome 2.

Here we describe a systematic genome-wide survey for genes required for JAK/STAT pathway activity. Analysis of 20,026 RNA interference (RNAi)-induced phenotypes in cultured Drosophila melanogaster haemocyte-like cells identified interacting genes encoding 4 known and 86 previously uncharacterized proteins. Subsequently, cell-based epistasis experiments were used to classify these proteins on the basis of their interaction with known components of the signalling cascade. In addition to multiple human disease gene homologues, we have found the tyrosine phosphatase Ptp61F and the Drosophila homologue of BRWD3, a bromo-domain-containing protein disrupted in leukaemia(3). Moreover, in vivo analysis demonstrates that disrupted dBRWD3 and overexpressed Ptp61F function as suppressors of leukaemia-like blood cell tumours.

Recently, Rb-mediated silencing of growth-promoting genes by heterochromatin formation associated with methylation of histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9me) was identified as a critical feature of cellular senescence, which may depend on the histone methyltransferase Suv39h1. Here we show that E mu-N-Ras transgenic mice harbouring targeted heterozygous lesions at the Suv39h1, or the p53 locus for comparison, succumb to invasive T-cell lymphomas that lack expression of Suv39h1 or p53, respectively. By contrast, most N-Ras-transgenic wild-type ('control') animals develop a non-lymphoid neoplasia significantly later. Proliferation of primary lymphocytes is directly stalled by a Suv39h1-dependent, H3K9me-related senescent growth arrest in response to oncogenic Ras, thereby cancelling lymphomagenesis at an initial step. Suv39h1-deficient lymphoma cells grow rapidly but, unlike p53-deficient cells, remain highly susceptible to adriamycin-induced apoptosis. In contrast, only control, but not Suv39h1-deficient or p53-deficient, lymphomas senesce after drug therapy when apoptosis is blocked. These results identify H3K9me-mediated senescence as a novel Suv39h1-dependent tumour suppressor mechanism whose inactivation permits the formation of aggressive but apoptosis-competent lymphomas in response to oncogenic Ras.","Charite Univ Med Berlin Haematol Oncol, D-13353 Berlin, Germany; Max Delbruck Ctr Mol Med, D-13125 Berlin, Germany; Res Inst Mol Pathol, A-1030 Vienna, Austria; Friedrich Miescher Inst Biomed Res, CH-4058 Basel, Switzerland; Hannover Med Sch, Inst Cell & Mol Pathol, D-30625 Hannover, Germany; Charite Univ Med Berlin, Dept Pathol, D-12200 Berlin, Germany","Schmitt, CA (reprint author), Charite Univ Med Berlin Haematol Oncol, D-13353 Berlin, Germany.",clemens.schmitt@charite.de,"Schmitt, Clemens/S-9479-2017","Schmitt, Clemens/0000-0002-4731-2226",,,,31,687,715,1,37,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,4-Aug,2005,436,7051,,,,,660,665,,10.1038/nature03841,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,951XA,WOS:000230964500034,16079837,No,,,11/20/17

We selected objects that have mid-infrared and radio emissions characteristic of quasars, but which are faint at near-infrared and optical wavelengths.

In the classical case, if the receiver has some prior information about the messages being conveyed, less communication is needed(3). Here we explore the concept of prior quantum information: given an unknown quantum state distributed over two systems, we determine how much quantum communication is needed to transfer the full state to one system. This communication measures the partial information one system needs, conditioned on its prior information. We find that it is given by the conditional entropy - a quantity that was known previously, but lacked an operational meaning. In the classical case, partial information must always be positive, but we find that in the quantum world this physical quantity can be negative. If the partial information is positive, its sender needs to communicate this number of quantum bits to the receiver; if it is negative, then sender and receiver instead gain the corresponding potential for future quantum communication. We introduce a protocol that we term 'quantum state merging' which optimally transfers partial information. We show how it enables a systematic understanding of quantum network theory, and discuss several important applications including distributed compression, noiseless coding with side information, multiple access channels and assisted entanglement distillation.","Univ Cambridge, Dept Appl Math & Theoret Phys, Cambridge CB3 0WA, England; Univ Gdansk, Inst Theoret Phys & Astrophys, PL-80952 Gdansk, Poland; Univ Bristol, Dept Math, Bristol BS8 1TW, Avon, England","Oppenheim, J (reprint author), Univ Cambridge, Dept Appl Math & Theoret Phys, Cambridge CB3 0WA, England.",j.oppenheim@damtp.cam.ac.uk,"Winter, Andreas/C-4185-2016","Winter, Andreas/0000-0001-6344-4870",,,,25,167,167,0,27,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,4-Aug,2005,436,7051,,,,,673,676,,10.1038/nature03909,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,951XA,WOS:000230964500037,16079840,No,,,11/20/17

However, their relatively small size, typically similar to 1 nm, calls for innovative approaches to realize a functioning single-molecule device(5-11). Here we report an approach for contacting a single molecule, and use it to study the effect of localizing groups within a conjugated molecule on the electrical conduction. Our method is based on synthesizing a dimer structure, consisting of two colloidal gold particles connected by a dithiolated short organic molecule(12,13), and electrostatically trapping it between two metal electrodes. We study the electrical conduction through three short organic molecules: 4,4' - biphenyldithiol (BPD), a fully conjugated molecule; bis( 4-mercaptophenyl)- ether (BPE)(14), in which the conjugation is broken at the centre by an oxygen atom; and 1,4-benzenedimethanethiol (BDMT), in which the conjugation is broken near the contacts by a methylene group.

Some smaller Antarctic ice shelves have undergone periodic growth and decay over the past 11,000 yr ( refs 7 - 11), but these ice shelves are at the climatic limit of ice shelf viability(12) and are therefore expected to respond rapidly to natural climate variability at century to millennial scales(8-11). Here we use records of diatoms, detrital material and geochemical parameters from six marine sediment cores in the vicinity of the Larsen ice shelf to demonstrate that the recent collapse of the Larsen B ice shelf is unprecedented during the Holocene. We infer from our oxygen isotope measurements in planktonic foraminifera that the Larsen B ice shelf has been thinning throughout the Holocene, and we suggest that the recent prolonged period of warming in the Antarctic Peninsula region(13,14), in combination with the long-term thinning, has led to collapse of the ice shelf.","Hamilton Coll, Dept Geosci, Clinton, NY 13323 USA; Colgate Univ, Dept Geol, Hamilton, NY 13346 USA; So Illinois Univ, Dept Geol, Carbondale, IL 62901 USA; Univ Barcelona, Dept Stratig Paleontol & Marine Geosci, E-08028 Barcelona, Spain; Hamilton Coll, Dept Phys, Clinton, NY 13323 USA; Queens Univ, Dept Geog, Kingston, ON K7L 3N6, Canada; Univ New Hampshire, Dept Earth Sci, Durham, NH 03824 USA","Domack, E (reprint author), Hamilton Coll, Dept Geosci, Clinton, NY 13323 USA.",edomack@hamilton.edu,"Amblas, David/A-5482-2015","Amblas, David/0000-0002-6248-5512",,,,29,178,184,1,26,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,4-Aug,2005,436,7051,,,,,681,685,,10.1038/nature03908,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,951XA,WOS:000230964500039,16079842,No,,,11/20/17

Here I define an index of the potential destructiveness of hurricanes based on the total dissipation of power, integrated over the lifetime of the cyclone, and show that this index has increased markedly since the mid-1970s. This trend is due to both longer storm lifetimes and greater storm intensities. I find that the record of net hurricane power dissipation is highly correlated with tropical sea surface temperature, reflecting well-documented climate signals, including multi-decadal oscillations in the North Atlantic and North Pacific, and global warming. My results suggest that future warming may lead to an upward trend in tropical cyclone destructive potential, and - taking into account an increasing coastal population a substantial increase in hurricane-related losses in the twenty-first century.","MIT, Program Atmospheres Oceans & Climate, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA","Emanuel, K (reprint author), MIT, Program Atmospheres Oceans & Climate, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",emanuel@texmex.mit.edu,,,,,,22,1456,1574,40,410,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,4-Aug,2005,436,7051,,,,,686,688,,10.1038/nature03906,,3,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,951XA,WOS:000230964500040,16056221,No,,,11/20/17

This slip weakening occurs over a critical distance, D-c. Understanding the controls on D-c in nature is severely limited, however, because the physical mechanism of weakening is unconstrained. Conventional friction experiments, typically conducted at slow slip rates and small displacements, have obtained Dc values that are orders of magnitude lower than values estimated from modelling seismological data for natural earthquakes(3-6). Here we present data on fluid transport properties of slip zone rocks and on the slip zone width in the centre of the Median Tectonic Line fault zone, Japan. We show that the discrepancy between laboratory and seismological results can be resolved if thermal pressurization of the pore fluid(7-10) is the slip-weakening mechanism. Our analysis indicates that a planar fault segment with an impermeable and narrow slip zone will become very unstable during slip and is likely to be the site of a seismic asperity.","Univ Nice Sophia Antipolis, CNRS, F-06560 Valbonne, France; Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Sci, Div Earth & Planetary Sci, Kyoto 6068502, Japan","Wibberley, CAJ (reprint author), Univ Nice Sophia Antipolis, CNRS, 250 Rue A Einstein, F-06560 Valbonne, France.",wibbs@geoazur.unice.fr,,,,,,30,180,192,0,27,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,4-Aug,2005,436,7051,,,,,689,692,,10.1038/nature03901,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,951XA,WOS:000230964500041,16079843,No,,,11/20/17

Here we apply an objective, repeatable approach for studying three-dimensional microwear surface texture to extinct South African hominins. Scanning confocal microscopy(12,13) together with scale-sensitive fractal analysis(14-19) are used to characterize the complexity and anisotropy of microwear. Results for living primates show that this approach can distinguish among diets characterized by different fracture properties. When applied to hominins(20), microwear texture analysis indicates that Australopithecus africanus microwear is more anisotropic, but also more variable in anisotropy than Paranthropus robustus. This latter species has more complex microwear textures, but is also more variable in complexity than A. africanus.

Here we show that a critical interplay of environmental forcing, specifically climate variability, and temporary immunity explains the interannual disease cycles present in a four-decade cholera time series from Matlab, Bangladesh. We reconstruct the transmission rate, the key epidemiological parameter affected by extrinsic forcing, over time for the predominant strain ( El Tor) with a nonlinear population model that permits a contributing effect of intrinsic immunity. Transmission shows clear interannual variability with a strong correspondence to climate patterns at long periods ( over 7 years, for monsoon rains and Brahmaputra river discharge) and at shorter periods ( under 7 years, for flood extent in Bangladesh, sea surface temperatures in the Bay of Bengal and the El Nino Southern Oscillation).

Here we search for naturally occurring genetic interactions in a large set of quantitative phenotypes - the levels of all transcripts in a cross between two strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae(7). For each transcript, we searched for secondary loci interacting with primary QTLs detected by their individual effects. Such locus pairs were estimated to be involved in the inheritance of 57% of transcripts; statistically significant pairs were identified for 225 transcripts. Among these, 67% of secondary loci had individual effects too small to be significant in a genome-wide scan. Engineered polymorphisms in isogenic strains confirmed an interaction between the mating-type locus MAT and the pheromone response gene GPA1.

Here we show that in hippocampal neurons in vitro, the axon consistently arises from the neurite that develops first after mitosis. Centrosomes, the Golgi apparatus and endosomes cluster together close to the area where the first neurite will form, which is in turn opposite from the plane of the last mitotic division. We show that the polarized activities of these organelles are necessary and sufficient for neuronal polarization: ( 1) polarized microtubule polymerization and membrane transport precedes first neurite formation, ( 2) neurons with more than one centrosome sprout more than one axon and ( 3) suppression of centrosome-mediated functions precludes polarization. We conclude that asymmetric centrosome-mediated dynamics in the early post-mitotic stage instruct neuronal polarity, implying that pre-mitotic mechanisms with a role in division orientation may in turn participate in this event.","Univ Turin, Cavalieri Ottolenghi Sci Inst, I-10043 Turin, Italy; Catholic Univ Louvain, Dept Human Genet, B-3000 Louvain, Belgium; Flanders Interuniv Inst Biotechnol, B-3000 Louvain, Belgium","Feiguin, F (reprint author), Univ Turin, Cavalieri Ottolenghi Sci Inst, I-10043 Turin, Italy.",fabian.feiguin@unito.it; carlos.dotti@unito.it,"Dotti, Carlos /I-5533-2015","Dotti, Carlos /0000-0003-4052-1719; Pollarolo, Giulia/0000-0002-7140-8981",,,,28,202,206,1,18,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,4-Aug,2005,436,7051,,,,,704,708,,10.1038/nature03811,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,951XA,WOS:000230964500045,16079847,No,,,11/20/17

Comprising the third largest lymphocyte population, natural killer (NK) cells recognize and kill cellular targets and produce pro-inflammatory cytokines. These potentially self-destructive effector functions can be controlled by inhibitory receptors for the polymorphic major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules that are ubiquitously expressed on target cells(2-4). However, inhibitory receptors are not uniformly expressed on NK cells, and are germline-encoded by a set of polymorphic genes that segregate independently from MHC genes(5,6). Therefore, how NK-cell self-tolerance arises in vivo is poorly understood. Here we demonstrate that NK cells acquire functional competence through 'licensing' by self-MHC molecules. Licensing involves a positive role for MHC-specific inhibitory receptors and requires the cytoplasmic inhibitory motif originally identified in effector responses. This process results in two types of self-tolerant NK cells - licensed or unlicensed - and may provide new insights for exploiting NK cells in immunotherapy. This self-tolerance mechanism may be more broadly applicable within the vertebrate immune system because related germline-encoded inhibitory receptors are widely expressed on other immune cells.","Washington Univ, Sch Med, Dept Med, Howard Hughes Med Inst,Div Rheumatol, St Louis, MO 63110 USA; Washington Univ, Sch Med, Dept Pathol & Immunol, St Louis, MO 63110 USA; Washington Univ, Sch Med, Dept Pediat, St Louis, MO 63110 USA; Washington Univ, Sch Med, Dept Otolaryngol, St Louis, MO 63110 USA; Univ Quebec, Inst Armand Frappier, INRS, Laval, PQ H7V 1B7, Canada","Yokoyama, WM (reprint author), Washington Univ, Sch Med, Dept Med, Howard Hughes Med Inst,Div Rheumatol, St Louis, MO 63110 USA.",yokoyama@wustl.edu,,,"NIAID NIH HHS [R01 AI033903, R01 AI051345, R37 AI034385]",,,30,696,721,3,26,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,4-Aug,2005,436,7051,,,,,709,713,,10.1038/nature03847,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,951XA,WOS:000230964500046,16079848,No,,,11/20/17

This evolutionary step exposed the kernel on the surface of the ear, such that it could readily be used by humans as a food source. Here we show that this key event in maize domestication is controlled by a single gene ( teosinte glume architecture or tga1), belonging to the SBP-domain family(2) of transcriptional regulators. The factor controlling the phenotypic difference between maize and teosinte maps to a 1-kilobase region, within which maize and teosinte show only seven fixed differences in their DNA sequences. One of these differences encodes a non-conservative amino acid substitution and may affect protein function, and the other six differences potentially affect gene regulation. Molecular evolution analyses show that this region was the target of selection during maize domestication. Our results demonstrate that modest genetic changes in single genes can induce dramatic changes in phenotype during domestication and evolution.","Univ Wisconsin, Genet Lab, Madison, WI 53706 USA; DuPont Crop Genet, Wilmington, DE 19880 USA; Univ Guelph, Dept Plant Agr, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada","Doebley, JF (reprint author), Univ Wisconsin, Genet Lab, Madison, WI 53706 USA.",jdoebley@wisc.edu,"vigouroux, Yves/A-9056-2011","Bomblies, Kirsten/0000-0002-2434-3863; Vigouroux, Yves/0000-0002-8361-6040",NIGMS NIH HHS [R01 GM058816],,,25,278,321,3,90,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,4-Aug,2005,436,7051,,,,,714,719,,10.1038/nature03863,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,951XA,WOS:000230964500047,16079849,No,,,11/20/17

This phenomenon, called senescence, is driven by telomere attrition, which triggers the induction of tumour suppressors including p16(INK4a) (ref. 5). In cultured cells, senescence can be elicited prematurely by oncogenes(6); however, whether such oncogene-induced senescence represents a physiological process has long been debated. Human naevi ( moles) are benign tumours of melanocytes that frequently harbour oncogenic mutations ( predominantly V600E, where valine is substituted for glutamic acid) in BRAF(7), a protein kinase and downstream effector of Ras. Nonetheless, naevi typically remain in a growth-arrested state for decades and only rarely progress into malignancy (melanoma)(8-10). This raises the question of whether naevi undergo BRAF(V600E)- induced senescence. Here we show that sustained BRAF(V600E) expression in human melanocytes induces cell cycle arrest, which is accompanied by the induction of both p16(INK4a) and senescence- associated acidic beta-galactosidase (SA-beta-Gal) activity, a commonly used senescence marker. Validating these results in vivo, congenital naevi are invariably positive for SA-beta-Gal, demonstrating the presence of this classical senescence-associated marker in a largely growth-arrested, neoplastic human lesion. In growth-arrested melanocytes, both in vitro and in situ, we observed a marked mosaic induction of p16(INK4a), suggesting that factors other than p16(INK4a) contribute to protection against BRAF(V600E)- driven proliferation. Naevi do not appear to suffer from telomere attrition, arguing in favour of an active oncogene-driven senescence process, rather than a loss of replicative potential. Thus, both in vitro and in vivo, BRAF(V600E)-expressing melanocytes display classical hallmarks of senescence, suggesting that oncogene-induced senescence represents a genuine protective physiological process.","Netherlands Canc Inst, Div Mol Genet, NL-1066 CX Amsterdam, Netherlands; Netherlands Canc Inst, Div Pathol, NL-1066 CX Amsterdam, Netherlands; Univ Michigan, Dept Dermatol, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; Univ Michigan, Ctr Comprehens Canc, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; Univ Amsterdam, Acad Med Ctr, Dept Plast Reconstruct & Hand Surg, NL-1100 AZ Amsterdam, Netherlands; Univ Texas, SW Med Ctr, Dept Biol, Dallas, TX 75390 USA; Univ Texas, SW Med Ctr, Harold Simmons Canc Ctr, Dallas, TX 75390 USA; Free Univ Amsterdam, Med Ctr, Dept Pathol, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands","Peeper, DS (reprint author), Netherlands Canc Inst, Div Mol Genet, Plesmanlaan 121, NL-1066 CX Amsterdam, Netherlands.",wj.mooi@vumc.nl; d.peeper@nki.nl,"Shay, Jerry/F-7878-2011; Soengas, Maria/H-6455-2015; DENOYELLE, Christophe/K-6205-2015; Tang, Amy/L-3226-2016","Soengas, Maria/0000-0003-0612-6299; Tang, Amy/0000-0002-5772-2878",,,,30,1211,1244,1,83,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,4-Aug,2005,436,7051,,,,,720,724,,10.1038/nature03890,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,951XA,WOS:000230964500048,16079850,No,,,11/20/17

The PTEN and p53 tumour suppressors are among the most commonly inactivated or mutated genes in human cancer including prostate cancer(4,5). Although they are functionally distinct, reciprocal cooperation has been proposed, as PTEN is thought to regulate p53 stability, and p53 to enhance PTEN transcription(6-10). Here we show that conditional inactivation of Trp53 in the mouse prostate fails to produce a tumour phenotype, whereas complete Pten inactivation in the prostate triggers non-lethal invasive prostate cancer after long latency. Strikingly, combined inactivation of Pten and Trp53 elicits invasive prostate cancer as early as 2 weeks after puberty and is invariably lethal by 7 months of age. Importantly, acute Pten inactivation induces growth arrest through the p53-dependent cellular senescence pathway both in vitro and in vivo, which can be fully rescued by combined loss of Trp53. Furthermore, we detected evidence of cellular senescence in specimens from early-stage human prostate cancer. Our results demonstrate the relevance of cellular senescence in restricting tumorigenesis in vivo and support a model for cooperative tumour suppression in which p53 is an essential failsafe protein of Pten-deficient tumours.","Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Sloan Kettering Inst, Canc Biol & Genet Program, New York, NY 10021 USA; Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Sloan Kettering Inst, Dept Pathol, New York, NY 10021 USA; Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Sloan Kettering Inst, Dept Med, New York, NY 10021 USA; Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Sloan Kettering Inst, Dept Radiol, New York, NY 10021 USA; Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Sloan Kettering Inst, Dept Med Phys, New York, NY 10021 USA; Columbia Univ, Inst Canc Genet, Dept Anat & Cell Biol, New York, NY 10032 USA","Pandolfi, PP (reprint author), Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Sloan Kettering Inst, Canc Biol & Genet Program, 1275 York Ave, New York, NY 10021 USA.",p-pandolfi@ski.mskcc.org,"Ludwig, Thomas/Q-6484-2016","Ludwig, Thomas/0000-0003-3461-2585","NCI NIH HHS [P50 CA092629, R01 CA137050]; NIMHD NIH HHS [R01 MD004038]",,,30,1088,1119,7,73,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,4-Aug,2005,436,7051,,,,,725,730,,10.1038/nature03918,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,951XA,WOS:000230964500049,16079851,No,,,11/20/17

In animal cells, the position of the cytokinesis furrow is specified by the position of the mitotic spindle(1). The cytokinesis furrow bisects the spindle midway between the microtubule asters, at the site of the microtubule-based midzone, producing two daughter cells. Experiments in some cell types have suggested that the midzone positions the furrow(2,3), but experiments in other cells have suggested that the asters position the furrow(4,5). One possibility is that different organisms and cell types use different mechanisms to position the cytokinesis furrow. An alternative possibility is that both asters and the midzone contribute to furrow positioning(6,7). Recent work in C. elegans has suggested that centrosome separation and the midzone are implicated in cytokinesis(8). Here we examine the relative contributions of different parts of the mitotic spindle to positioning of the cytokinesis furrow in the C. elegans zygote. By spatially separating the spindle midzone from one of the asters using an ultraviolet laser, we show that the cytokinesis furrow is first positioned by a signal determined by microtubule asters, and then by a second signal that is derived from the spindle midzone. Thus, the position of the cytokinesis furrow is specified by two consecutive furrowing activities.","Max Planck Inst Mol Cell Biol & Genet, D-01307 Dresden, Germany","Bringmann, H (reprint author), Max Planck Inst Mol Cell Biol & Genet, Pfotenhauer Str 108, D-01307 Dresden, Germany.",bringman@mpi-cbg.de,"Hyman, Anthony/B-3917-2017","Hyman, Anthony/0000-0003-3664-154X",,,,25,135,151,0,7,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,4-Aug,2005,436,7051,,,,,731,734,,10.1038/nature03823,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,951XA,WOS:000230964500050,16079852,No,,,11/20/17

The spRNAP-IV lacks 262 amino-terminal amino acids of mitochondrial RNA polymerase, including the mitochondrial-targeting signal, and localizes to the nucleus. Transcription by spRNAP-IV is resistant to the RNA polymease II inhibitor alpha-amanitin but is sensitive to short interfering RNA specific for the POLRMT gene.

Primary miRNAs are processed to precursor miRNAs (pre-miRNAs) by the Microprocessor complex(2-4). These pre-miRNAs are cleaved by the RNase III Dicer(5-8) to generate mature miRNAs that direct the RNA-induced silencing complex ( RISC) to messenger RNAs with complementary sequence(9). Here we show that TRBP ( the human immunodeficiency virus transactivating response RNA-binding protein(10)), which contains three double-stranded, RNA-binding domains, is an integral component of a Dicer-containing complex. Biochemical analysis of TRBP-containing complexes revealed the association of Dicer - TRBP with Argonaute 2 (Ago2)(11,12), the catalytic engine of RISC. The physical association of Dicer - TRBP and Ago2 was confirmed after the isolation of the ternary complex using Flag-tagged Ago2 cell lines. In vitro reconstitution assays demonstrated that TRBP is required for the recruitment of Ago2 to the small interfering RNA ( siRNA) bound by Dicer. Knockdown of TRBP results in destabilization of Dicer and a consequent loss of miRNA biogenesis. Finally, depletion of the Dicer - TRBP complex via exogenously introduced siRNAs diminished RISC-mediated reporter gene silencing. These results support a role of the Dicer - TRBP complex not only in miRNA processing but also as a platform for RISC assembly.","Wistar Inst Anat & Biol, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA","Shiekhattar, R (reprint author), Wistar Inst Anat & Biol, 3601 Spruce St, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",shiekhattar@wistar.org,,,"NCI NIH HHS [P01 CA072765, P01 CA072765-050002]; NHLBI NIH HHS [R01 HL070045, R01 HL070045-03]; NIGMS NIH HHS [R01 GM040536, R01 GM040536-15]",,,19,1106,1180,5,119,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,4-Aug,2005,436,7051,,,,,740,744,,10.1038/nature03868,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,951XA,WOS:000230964500052,15973356,No,,,11/20/17

Earth composition models suggest that the radiogenic power from these isotope decays is 16 TW, approximately half of the total measured heat dissipation rate from the Earth.

Assuming a Th/U mass concentration ratio of 3.9, the 90 per cent confidence interval for the total number of geoneutrinos detected is 4.5 to 54.2. This result is consistent with the central value of 19 predicted by geophysical models.

Volcanic evolution produced compositions from low-silica basalts to high-silica dacite in the Syrtis Major caldera. The existence of dacite demonstrates that highly evolved lavas have been produced, at least locally, by magma evolution through fractional crystallization. Olivine basalts are observed on crater floors and in layers exposed in canyon walls up to 4.5 km beneath the surface. This vertical distribution suggests that olivine-rich lavas were emplaced at various times throughout the formation of the upper crust, with their growing inventory suggesting that such ultramafic (picritic) basalts may be relatively common. Quartz-bearing granitoid rocks have also been discovered, demonstrating that extreme differentiation has occurred. These observations show that the martian crust, while dominated by basalt, contains a diversity of igneous materials whose range in composition from picritic basalts to granitoids rivals that found on the Earth.","Arizona State Univ, Dept Geol Sci, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA; Univ Tennessee, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA; Univ Hawaii, Inst Geophys & Planetol, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; Univ Colorado, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; US Geol Survey, Carson City, NV 89703 USA; Malin Space Sci Syst, San Diego, CA 92191 USA","Christensen, PR (reprint author), Arizona State Univ, Dept Geol Sci, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA.",phil.christensen@asu.edu,"Moersch, Jeffrey/F-7189-2010; Rogers, Deanne/I-9737-2016","Moersch, Jeffrey/0000-0003-3433-9419; Rogers, Deanne/0000-0002-4671-2551; Bandfield, Joshua/0000-0003-3571-3716",,,,49,109,111,0,19,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,28-Jul,2005,436,7050,,,,,504,509,,10.1038/nature03639,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,949LE,WOS:000230788800051,16007077,No,,,11/20/17

Precise agreement between helioseismological measurements and predictions of theoretical solar models(1) has been a triumph of modern astrophysics. A recent downward revision by 25-35 per cent of the solar abundances of light elements such as C, N, O and Ne (ref. 2) has, however, broken this accordance: models adopting the new abundances incorrectly predict the depth of the convection zone, the depth profiles of sound speed and density, and the helium abundance(1,3). The discrepancies are far beyond the uncertainties in either the data or the model predictions(4). Here we report neon-to-oxygen ratios measured in a sample of nearby solar-like stars, using their X-ray spectra. The abundance ratios are all very similar and substantially larger than the recently revised solar value. The neon abundance in the Sun is quite poorly determined. If the Ne/O abundance in these stars is adopted for the Sun, the models are brought back into agreement with helioseismology measurements(5,6).","Harvard Smithsonian Ctr Astrophys, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; MIT, MIT Kavli Inst Astrophys & Space Res, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA","Drake, JJ (reprint author), Harvard Smithsonian Ctr Astrophys, 60 Garden St, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",jdrake@cfa.harvard.edu,,,,,,30,157,158,0,2,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,28-Jul,2005,436,7050,,,,,525,528,,10.1038/nature03803,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,949LE,WOS:000230788800054,16049481,No,,,11/20/17

Phase measurements on relatively large quantum dots(1) recently revealed that the phase evolution for electrons traversing the dots exhibits a 'universal' behaviour, independent of dot size, shape, and electron occupancy(2,3). Specifically, for quantum dots in the Coulomb blockade regime, the transmission phase increases monotonically by pi throughout each conductance peak; in the conductance valleys, the phase returns sharply to its starting value. The expected mesoscopic features in the phase evolution-related to the dot's shape, spin degeneracy or to exchange effects-have not been observed, and there is at present no satisfactory explanation for the observed universality in phase behaviour(4). Here we report the results of phase measurements on a series of small quantum dots, having occupancies of between only 1-20 electrons, where the phase behaviour for electron transmission should in principle be easier to interpret. In contrast to the universal behaviour observed thus far only in the larger dots, we see clear mesoscopic features in the phase measurements when the dot occupancy is less than similar to 10 electrons. As the occupancy increases, the manner of phase evolution changes and universal behaviour is recovered for some 14 electrons or more. The identification of a transition from the expected mesoscopic behaviour to universal phase evolution should help to direct and constrain theoretical models for the latter.","Weizmann Inst Sci, Braun Ctr Submicron Res, Dept Condensed Matter Phys, IL-76100 Rehovot, Israel","Heiblum, M (reprint author), Weizmann Inst Sci, Braun Ctr Submicron Res, Dept Condensed Matter Phys, IL-76100 Rehovot, Israel.",heiblum@wisemail.weizmann.ac.il,,,,,,26,121,122,0,10,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,28-Jul,2005,436,7050,,,,,529,533,,10.1038/nature03899,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,949LE,WOS:000230788800055,16049482,No,,,11/20/17

Despite the diversity of ingredients, which include atoms, molecules, electrons and their spins, the collective behaviour can be grouped into several families (called 'universality classes') represented by canonical spin models(1). One kind of transition, the Mott transition(2), occurs when the repulsive Coulomb interaction between electrons is increased, causing wave-like electrons to behave as particles. In two dimensions, the attractive behaviour responsible for the superconductivity in high-transition temperature copper oxide(3,4) and organic(5-7) compounds appears near the Mott transition, but the universality class to which two-dimensional, repulsive electronic systems belongs remains unknown. Here we present an observation of the critical phenomena at the pressure-induced Mott transition in a quasi-two-dimensional organic conductor using conductance measurements as a probe. We find that the Mott transition in two dimensions is not consistent with known universality classes, as the observed collective behaviour has previously not been seen. This peculiarity must be involved in any emergent behaviour near the Mott transition in two dimensions.","Univ Tokyo, Dept Appl Phys, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo 1138656, Japan; Japan Sci & Technol Corp, CREST, Kawaguchi 3320012, Japan","Kanoda, K (reprint author), Univ Tokyo, Dept Appl Phys, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo 1138656, Japan.",kanoda@ap.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp,"Kagawa, Fumitaka/A-2824-2014","Kagawa, Fumitaka/0000-0002-1763-6799",,,,25,180,180,5,42,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,28-Jul,2005,436,7050,,,,,534,537,,10.1038/nature03806,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,949LE,WOS:000230788800056,16049483,No,,,11/20/17

Amazonian rivers were recently shown to outgas more than ten times the amount of carbon exported to the ocean in the form of total organic carbon or dissolved inorganic carbon(1). High carbon dioxide concentrations in rivers originate largely from in situ respiration of organic carbon(1-3), but little agreement exists about the sources or turnover times of this carbon(2,4,5). Here we present results of an extensive survey of the carbon isotope composition (C-13 and C-14) of dissolved inorganic carbon and three size-fractions of organic carbon across the Amazonian river system. We find that respiration of contemporary organic matter (less than five years old) originating on land and near rivers is the dominant source of excess carbon dioxide that drives outgassing in medium to large rivers, although we find that bulk organic carbon fractions transported by these rivers range from tens to thousands of years in age. We therefore suggest that a small, rapidly cycling pool of organic carbon is responsible for the large carbon fluxes from land to water to atmosphere in the humid tropics.","Univ Washington, Sch Oceanog, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; Stroud Water Res Ctr, Avondale, PA 19311 USA; Rice Univ, Dept Earth Sci, Houston, TX 77005 USA; USP, CENA, Lab Ecol Isotop, BR-13400970 Piracicaba, SP, Brazil; Lawrence Livermore Natl Lab, Ctr Accelerator Mass Spectrometry, Livermore, CA 94551 USA","Mayorga, E (reprint author), Univ Washington, Sch Oceanog, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.",emiliomayorga@alum.mit.edu,"Masiello, Caroline/A-2653-2011","Masiello, Caroline/0000-0003-2102-6229; Mayorga, Emilio/0000-0003-2574-4623",,,,30,271,278,6,139,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,28-Jul,2005,436,7050,,,,,538,541,,10.1038/nature03880,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,949LE,WOS:000230788800057,16049484,No,,,11/20/17

The gradient in seismic velocity that occurs at this boundary is central to constraining the physical and chemical properties that create differences in mechanical strength between the two layers. For example, if the lithosphere is simply a thermal boundary layer that is more rigid owing to colder temperatures, mantle flow models(1,2) indicate that the velocity gradient at its base would occur over tens of kilometres. In contrast, if the asthenosphere is weak owing to volatile enrichment(3-6) or the presence of partial melt(7), the lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary could occur over a much smaller depth range.

An alternative speciation route is homoploid hybrid speciation(1) in which two ancestral taxa give rise to a third, derived, species by hybridization without a change in chromosome number. Although theoretically possible it has been regarded as rare(1) and hence of little importance in animals. On the basis of molecular and chromosomal evidence, hybridization is the best explanation for the origin of a handful of extant diploid bisexual animal taxa(2-6). Here we report the first case in which hybridization between two host-specific animals (tephritid fruitflies) is clearly associated with the shift to a new resource. Such a hybrid host shift presents an ecologically robust scenario for animal hybrid speciation because it offers a potential mechanism for reproductive isolation through differential adaptation to a new ecological niche(7). The necessary conditions for this mechanism of speciation(7) are common in parasitic animals, which represent much of animal diversity(8). The frequency of homoploid hybrid speciation in animals may therefore be higher than previously assumed.","Penn State Univ, Dept Entomol, University Pk, PA 16803 USA","Schwarz, D (reprint author), Penn State Univ, Dept Entomol, 501 ASI Bldg, University Pk, PA 16803 USA.",dxs332@psu.edu,"Marion-Poll, Frederic/D-8882-2011","Marion-Poll, Frederic/0000-0001-6824-0180; McPheron, Bruce/0000-0001-9623-5100",,,,30,147,153,5,71,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,28-Jul,2005,436,7050,,,,,546,549,,10.1038/nature03800,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,949LE,WOS:000230788800059,16049486,No,,,11/20/17

The observation that many proteins can convert into similar structures in vitro has suggested that this ability is a generic feature of polypeptide chains(1,8). Here we have probed the nature of the amyloid structure by monitoring hydrogen/deuterium exchange in fibrils formed from an SH3 domain(9-12) using a combination of nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry. The results reveal that under the conditions used in this study, exchange is dominated by a mechanism of dissociation and re-association that results in the recycling of molecules within the fibril population.

In ureteric smooth muscle, peristaltic waves that occur as invading pacemaker potentials produce long-lasting action potentials (300-800 ms) and extraordinarily long ( more than 10 s) refractory periods(1-6), which prevent urine reflux and kidney damage(2). For smooth muscles neither the mechanisms underlying the refractory period nor the link between excitability and refractoriness are properly understood. Here we show that a negative feedback process, which depends on Ca2+ loading the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) during the action potential and on the subsequent activation of local releases of Ca2+ from the SR (sparks(7)), stimulating plasmalemmal Ca2+-sensitive K+ (BK) channels, determines the refractory period of the action potential. As sparks gradually reduce the Ca2+ load in the SR, electrical inhibition is released, the refractory period is terminated and peristaltic contractions occur again. The refractory period can be manipulated, for example from 10 s to 100 s, by altering the Ca2+ content of the SR or release mechanism or by inhibiting BK channels. This insight into the control of excitability and hence function provides a focus for therapies directed at pathologies of smooth muscle.","Univ Liverpool, Dept Physiol, Liverpool L69 3BX, Merseyside, England","Burdyga, T (reprint author), Univ Liverpool, Dept Physiol, Liverpool L69 3BX, Merseyside, England.",burdyga@liv.ac.uk,"wray, susan/B-1197-2009","Wray, Susan/0000-0002-0086-1359",,,,26,67,70,2,7,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,28-Jul,2005,436,7050,,,,,559,562,,10.1038/nature03834,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,949LE,WOS:000230788800062,16049489,No,,,11/20/17

Here we show that the janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK/STAT) pathway provides a sex-specific signal from the soma to the germ line in Drosophila embryonic gonads. The somatic gonad expresses a JAK/STAT ligand, unpaired (upd), in a male-specific manner, and activates the JAK/STAT pathway in male germ cells at the time of gonad formation. Furthermore, the JAK/STAT pathway is necessary for male-specific germ cell behaviour during early gonad development, and is sufficient to activate aspects of male germ cell behaviour in female germ cells. Our findings provide direct evidence that the JAK/STAT pathway mediates a key signal from the somatic gonad that regulates male germline sexual development.","Johns Hopkins Univ, Dept Biol, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA; Johns Hopkins Univ, Sch Med, Dept Cell Biol, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA","Van Doren, M (reprint author), Johns Hopkins Univ, Dept Biol, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA.",vandoren@jhu.edu,,,"NICHD NIH HHS [R01 HD046619]; NIGMS NIH HHS [F32 GM066562, R01 GM063023]",,,30,70,72,0,8,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,28-Jul,2005,436,7050,,,,,563,567,,10.1038/nature03849,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,949LE,WOS:000230788800063,16049490,No,,,11/20/17

However, the implementation of this strategy has faced two major obstacles. First, the long-term shutdown of tumour blood vessels by the anti-angiogenesis agent can prevent the tumour from receiving a therapeutic concentration of the chemotherapy agent. Second, inhibiting blood supply drives the intra-tumoural accumulation of hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha (HIF1-alpha); overexpression of HIF1-alpha is correlated with increased tumour invasiveness and resistance to chemotherapy(2-5). Here we report the disease-driven engineering of a drug delivery system, a 'nanocell', which overcomes these barriers unique to solid tumours. The nanocell comprises a nuclear nanoparticle within an extranuclear pegylated-lipid envelope, and is preferentially taken up by the tumour. The nanocell enables a temporal release of two drugs: the outer envelope first releases an anti-angiogenesis agent, causing a vascular shutdown; the inner nanoparticle, which is trapped inside the tumour, then releases a chemotherapy agent. This focal release within a tumour results in improved therapeutic index with reduced toxicity. The technology can be extended to additional agents, so as to target multiple signalling pathways or distinct tumour compartments, enabling the model of an 'integrative' approach in cancer therapy.","MIT, Biol Engn Div, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; MIT, Dept Chem, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; Whitehead Inst Biomed Res, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA","Sasisekharan, R (reprint author), MIT, Biol Engn Div, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",rams@MIT.edu,"Xu, Qingguo/C-1962-2014","Xu, Qingguo/0000-0003-3191-0771",,,,21,561,581,9,192,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,28-Jul,2005,436,7050,,,,,568,572,,10.1038/nature03794,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,949LE,WOS:000230788800064,16049491,No,,,11/20/17

Salp15 was then shown to adhere to the spirochaete, both in vitro and in vivo, and specifically interacted with B. burgdorferi outer surface protein C. The binding of Salp15 protected B. burgdorferi from antibody-mediated killing in vitro and provided spirochaetes with a marked advantage when they were inoculated into naive mice or animals previously infected with B. burgdorferi. Moreover, RNA interference-mediated repression of salp15 in I. scapularis drastically reduced the capacity of tick-borne spirochaetes to infect mice.

The mechanism by which TCR-pMHC ligation initiates signalling, a process termed TCR triggering, remains controversial(3-5). It has been proposed(6-8) that TCR triggering is promoted by segregation at the T cell-APC interface of cell-surface molecules with small ectodomains (such as TCR-pMHC and accessory receptors) from molecules with large ectodomains (such as the receptor protein tyrosine phosphatases CD45 and CD148). Here we show that increasing the dimensions of the TCR-pMHC interaction by elongating the pMHC ectodomain greatly reduces TCR triggering without affecting TCR-pMHC ligation. A similar dependence on receptor-ligand complex dimensions was observed with artificial TCR-ligand systems that span the same dimensions as the TCR-pMHC complex. Interfaces between T cells and APCs expressing elongated pMHC showed an increased intermembrane separation distance and less depletion of CD45. These results show the importance of the small size of the TCR-pMHC complex and support a role for size-based segregation of cell-surface molecules in TCR triggering.","Univ Oxford, Sir William Dunn Sch Pathol, Oxford OX1 3RE, England; Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Wright Fleming Inst, Dept Immunol, London W2 1PG, England","van der Merwe, PA (reprint author), Univ Oxford, Sir William Dunn Sch Pathol, S Parks Rd, Oxford OX1 3RE, England.",k.gould@imperial.ac.uk; anton.vandermerwe@path.ox.ac.uk,"van der Merwe, P.

Intraflagellar transport (IFT) motors assemble and maintain cilia by transporting ciliary precursors, bound to protein complexes called IFT particles, from the base of the cilium to their site of incorporation at the distal tip(1-3). In Caenorhabditis elegans, this is accomplished by two IFT motors, kinesin-II and osmotic avoidance defective (OSM)-3 kinesin, which cooperate to form two sequential anterograde IFT pathways that build distinct parts of cilia(4-7). By observing the movement of fluorescent IFT motors and IFT particles along the cilia of numerous ciliary mutants, we identified three genes whose protein products mediate the functional coordination of these motors. The BBS proteins BBS-7 and BBS-8 are required to stabilize complexes of IFT particles containing both of the IFT motors, because IFT particles in bbs-7 and bbs-8 mutants break down into two subcomplexes, IFT-A and IFT-B, which are moved separately by kinesin-II and OSM-3 kinesin, respectively. A conserved ciliary protein, DYF-1, is specifically required for OSM-3 kinesin to dock onto and move IFT particles, because OSM-3 kinesin is inactive and intact IFT particles are moved by kinesin-II alone in dyf-1 mutants. These findings implicate BBS ciliary disease proteins and an OSM-3 kinesin activator in the formation of two IFT pathways that build functional cilia.","Univ Calif Davis, Ctr Genet & Dev, Sect Mol & Cellular Biol, Davis, CA 95616 USA; Simon Fraser Univ, Dept Mol Biol & Biochem, Burnaby, BC V5A 1S6, Canada","Scholey, JM (reprint author), Univ Calif Davis, Ctr Genet & Dev, Sect Mol & Cellular Biol, Davis, CA 95616 USA.",jmscholey@ucdavis.edu,,"Blacque, Oliver/0000-0003-1598-2695",,,,28,225,241,0,21,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,28-Jul,2005,436,7050,,,,,583,587,,10.1038/nature03818,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,949LE,WOS:000230788800067,16049494,No,,,11/20/17

Evolutionary theories suggest that protein expression levels maximize fitness(1-11), but the fitness as a function of protein level has seldom been directly measured. To address this, we studied the lac system of Escherichia coli, which allows the cell to use the sugar lactose for growth(12). We experimentally measured the growth burden(13,14) due to production and maintenance of the Lac proteins (cost), as well as the growth advantage (benefit) conferred by the Lac proteins when lactose is present. The fitness function, given by the difference between the benefit and the cost, predicts that for each lactose environment there exists an optimal Lac expression level that maximizes growth rate. We then performed serial dilution evolution experiments at different lactose concentrations. In a few hundred generations, cells evolved to reach the predicted optimal expression levels. Thus, protein expression from the lac operon seems to be a solution of a cost-benefit optimization problem, and can be rapidly tuned by evolution to function optimally in new environments.","Weizmann Inst Sci, Dept Mol Cell Biol, IL-76100 Rehovot, Israel; Weizmann Inst Sci, Dept Phys Complex Syst, IL-76100 Rehovot, Israel","Alon, U (reprint author), Weizmann Inst Sci, Dept Mol Cell Biol, IL-76100 Rehovot, Israel.",urialon@weizmann.ac.il,,,,,,30,366,367,2,61,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,28-Jul,2005,436,7050,,,,,588,592,,10.1038/nature03842,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,949LE,WOS:000230788800068,16049495,No,,,11/20/17

It is widely accepted that large ice sheets first appeared on Antarctica similar to 34 million years ago, coincident with decreasing atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations and a deepening of the calcite compensation depth in the world's oceans, and that glaciation in the Northern Hemisphere began much later, between 10 and 6 million years ago. Here we present records of sediment and foraminiferal geochemistry covering the greenhouse - icehouse climate transition. We report evidence for synchronous deepening and subsequent oscillations in the calcite compensation depth in the tropical Pacific and South Atlantic oceans from similar to 42 million years ago, with a permanent deepening 34 million years ago. The most prominent variations in the calcite compensation depth coincide with changes in seawater oxygen isotope ratios of up to 1.5 per mil, suggesting a lowering of global sea level through significant storage of ice in both hemispheres by at least 100 to 125 metres. Variations in benthic carbon isotope ratios of up to similar to 1.4 per mil occurred at the same time, indicating large changes in carbon cycling. We suggest that the greenhouse - icehouse transition was closely coupled to the evolution of atmospheric carbon dioxide, and that negative carbon cycle feedbacks may have prevented the permanent establishment of large ice sheets earlier than 34 million years ago.","Univ Cambridge, Dept Earth Sci, Cambridge CB2 3EQ, England; Univ Stockholm, Dept Geol & Geochem, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden","Tripati, A (reprint author), Univ Cambridge, Dept Earth Sci, Downing St, Cambridge CB2 3EQ, England.",atri02@esc.cam.ac.uk,"Tripati, Aradhna/C-9419-2011","Tripati, Aradhna/0000-0002-1695-1754",,,,44,170,184,3,45,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,21-Jul,2005,436,7049,,,,,341,346,,10.1038/nature03874,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,947DK,WOS:000230623400032,16034408,No,,,11/20/17

To identify its underlying mechanisms we map the destinations of embryonic neural crest and mesodermal stem cells using Cre- recombinase-mediated transgenesis. The single-cell resolution of this genetic labelling reveals cryptic cell boundaries traversing the seemingly homogeneous skeleton of the neck and shoulders. Within this assembly of bones and muscles we discern a precise code of connectivity that mesenchymal stem cells of both neural crest and mesodermal origin obey as they form muscle scaffolds. The neural crest anchors the head onto the anterior lining of the shoulder girdle, while a Hox-gene-controlled mesoderm links trunk muscles to the posterior neck and shoulder skeleton. The skeleton that we identify as neural crest-derived is specifically affected in human Klippel - Feil syndrome, Sprengel's deformity and Arnold - Chiari I/II malformation, providing insights into their likely aetiology. We identify genes involved in the cellular modularity of the neck and shoulder skeleton and propose a new method for determining skeletal homologies that is based on muscle attachments.

Adipose-specific Glut4 ( also known as Slc2a4) knockout (adipose-Glut4(-/-)) mice show insulin resistance secondarily in muscle and liver. Here we show, using DNA arrays, that expression of retinol binding protein-4 (RBP4) is elevated in adipose tissue of adipose-Glut4(-/-) mice. We show that serum RBP4 levels are elevated in insulin-resistant mice and humans with obesity and type 2 diabetes. RBP4 levels are normalized by rosiglitazone, an insulin-sensitizing drug. Transgenic overexpression of human RBP4 or injection of recombinant RBP4 in normal mice causes insulin resistance. Conversely, genetic deletion of Rbp4 enhances insulin sensitivity. Fenretinide, a synthetic retinoid that increases urinary excretion of RBP4, normalizes serum RBP4 levels and improves insulin resistance and glucose intolerance in mice with obesity induced by a high-fat diet. Increasing serum RBP4 induces hepatic expression of the gluconeogenic enzyme phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase ( PEPCK) and impairs insulin signalling in muscle. Thus, RBP4 is an adipocyte-derived 'signal' that may contribute to the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes. Lowering RBP4 could be a new strategy for treating type 2 diabetes.","Beth Israel Deaconess Med Ctr, Dept Med, Div Endocrinol Diabet & Metab, Boston, MA 02215 USA; Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Boston, MA 02215 USA; Columbia Univ Coll Phys & Surg, Inst Canc Res, Dept Med, New York, NY 10032 USA","Kahn, BB (reprint author), Beth Israel Deaconess Med Ctr, Dept Med, Div Endocrinol Diabet & Metab, Boston, MA 02215 USA.",bkahn@bidmc.harvard.edu,,,,,,50,1164,1286,6,91,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,21-Jul,2005,436,7049,,,,,356,362,,10.1038/nature03711,,7,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,947DK,WOS:000230623400034,16034410,No,,,11/20/17

In the young Solar System, such collisions were more common and the dust production rate should have been many times larger(1). Yet copious dust in the zodiacal region around stars much younger than the Sun has rarely been found(2). Dust is known to orbit around several hundred main-sequence stars(3), but this dust is cold and comes from a Kuiper-belt analogous region out beyond the orbit of Neptune. Despite many searches, only a few main-sequence stars reveal warm (> 120 K) dust analogous to zodiacal dust near the Earth(3-5). Signs of planet formation ( in the form of collisions between bodies) in the regions of stars corresponding to the orbits of the terrestrial planets in our Solar System have therefore been elusive. Here we report an exceptionally large amount of warm, small, silicate dust particles around the solar-type star BD+20 307 ( HIP 8920, SAO75016).

The population of visible craters evolves with impacts, and because there are no competing endogenic processes to modify the surface, determining the various ways younger craters add to or subtract from the population is a fundamental aspect of small-body geology(1,2). Asteroid 433 Eros, the most closely studied small body, has regions of substantially different crater densities(3-5) that remain unexplained. Here we show that the formation of a relatively young crater ( 7.6 km in diameter) resulted in the removal of other craters as large as 0.5 km over nearly 40 per cent of the asteroid. Burial by ejecta cannot explain the observed pattern of crater removal. The limitation of reduced crater density to a zone within a particular straight-line distance through the asteroid from the centre of the large crater suggests degradation of the topography by seismic energy(6) released during the impact. Our observations indicate that the interior of Eros is sufficiently cohesive to transmit seismic energy over many kilometres, and the outer several tens of metres of the asteroid must be composed of relatively non-cohesive material.","Cornell Univ, Ctr Radiophys & Space Res, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; Northwestern Univ, Ctr Planetary Sci, Evanston, IL USA","Thomas, PC (reprint author), Cornell Univ, Ctr Radiophys & Space Res, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",thomas@baritone.astro.cornell.edu,,,,,,29,30,30,2,5,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,21-Jul,2005,436,7049,,,,,366,369,,10.1038/nature03855,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,947DK,WOS:000230623400036,16034412,No,,,11/20/17

Optical tweezers offer high resolution for trapping single particles, but have a limited manipulation area owing to tight focusing requirements; on the other hand, electrokinetic forces and other mechanisms provide high throughput, but lack the flexibility or the spatial resolution necessary for controlling individual cells. Here we present an optical image-driven dielectrophoresis technique that permits high-resolution patterning of electric fields on a photoconductive surface for manipulating single particles. It requires 100,000 times less optical intensity than optical tweezers. Using an incoherent light source ( a light-emitting diode or a halogen lamp) and a digital micromirror spatial light modulator, we have demonstrated parallel manipulation of 15,000 particle traps on a 1.3 x 1.0 mm(2) area.

Because the time resolution attainable in such experiments depends on the temporal definition of the laser pulses, pulse compression to 200 attoseconds ( 1 as = 10(-18) s) is a promising recent development. These ultrafast pulses have been fully characterized(7), and used to directly measure light waves(8) and electronic relaxation in free atoms(2-4). But attosecond pulses can only be realized in the extreme ultraviolet and X-ray regime; in contrast, the optical laser pulses typically used for experiments on complex systems last several femtoseconds ( 1 fs = 10(-15) s)(1,5,6). Here we monitor the dynamics of ultrafast electron transfer - a process important in photo- and electrochemistry and used in solid-state solar cells, molecular electronics and single-electron devices - on attosecond timescales using core-hole spectroscopy. We push the method, which uses the lifetime of a core electron hole as an internal reference clock for following dynamic processes(9-19), into the attosecond regime by focusing on short-lived holes with initial and final states in the same electronic shell.

Pressure-induced electronic spin transitions of iron occur in magnesiowustite, silicate perovskite and post-perovskite(1-4,8,10,11). Here we have studied the spin states of iron in magnesiowustite and the isolated effects of the electronic transitions on the elasticity of magnesiowustite with in situ X-ray emission spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction to pressures of the lowermost mantle. An observed high-spin to low-spin transition of iron in magnesiowustite results in an abnormal compressional behaviour between the high-spin and the low-spin states. The high-pressure, low-spin state exhibits a much higher bulk modulus and bulk sound velocity than the low-pressure, high-spin state; the bulk modulus jumps by similar to 35 per cent and bulk sound velocity increases by similar to 15 per cent across the transition in (Mg-0.83, Fe-0.17) O. Although no significant density change is observed across the electronic transition, the jump in the sound velocities and the bulk modulus across the transition provides an additional explanation for the seismic wave heterogeneity in the lowermost mantle(12-21).

This partitioning of deformation suggests that the cratons are stronger than surrounding younger Phanerozoic provinces. However, although Archaean and Phanerozoic lithosphere differ in their thickness(2-4) and composition(4,5), their relative strength is a matter of much debate. One proxy of strength is the effective elastic thickness of the lithosphere, T-e. Unfortunately, spatial variations in T-e are not well understood, as different methods yield different results. The differences are most apparent in cratons, where the 'Bouguer coherence' method yields large T-e values (> 60 km)(6-9) whereas the 'free-air admittance' method yields low values (< 25 km)(10). Here we present estimates of the variability of T-e in Europe using both methods. We show that when they are consistently formulated(11), both methods yield comparable T-e values that correlate with geology, and that the strength of old lithosphere (>= 1.5 Gyr old) is much larger ( mean T-e > 60 km) than that of younger lithosphere ( mean T-e < 30 km).

Reinforcement is distinguished from other models that consider the formation of reproductive isolation to be a by-product of divergent evolution(4,5). Although theory has shown that reinforcement is a possible mechanism that can lead to speciation(6-8), empirical evidence has been sufficiently scarce to raise doubts about the importance of reinforcement in nature(6,9,10). Agrodiaetus butterflies ( Lepidoptera: Lycaenidae) exhibit unusual variability in chromosome number. Whereas their genitalia and other morphological characteristics are largely uniform, different species vary considerably in male wing colour, and provide a model system to study the role of reinforcement in speciation. Using comparative phylogenetic methods, we show that the sympatric distribution of 15 relatively young sister taxa of Agrodiaetus strongly correlates with differences in male wing colour, and that this pattern is most likely the result of reinforcement. We find little evidence supporting sympatric speciation: rather, in Agrodiaetus, karyotypic changes accumulate gradually in allopatry, prompting reinforcement when karyotypically divergent races come into contact.","Harvard Univ, Dept Organism & Evolutionary Biol, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; St Petersburg State Univ, Dept Entomol, St Petersburg 199034, Russia; Bauer Ctr Genom Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA","Pierce, NE (reprint author), Harvard Univ, Dept Organism & Evolutionary Biol, 26 Oxford St, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",npierce@fas.harvard.edu,"Plotkin, Joshua/E-6947-2013; Lukhtanov, Vladimir/C-6740-2008","Lukhtanov, Vladimir/0000-0003-2856-2075",,,,30,108,120,0,33,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,21-Jul,2005,436,7049,,,,,385,389,,10.1038/nature03704,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,947DK,WOS:000230623400041,16034417,No,,,11/20/17

Modelled activity rates are very low, indicating that most prokaryotes may be inactive or have extraordinarily slow metabolism(2). Here we present results from two Pacific Ocean sites, margin and open ocean, both of which have deep, subsurface stimulation of prokaryotic processes associated with geochemical and/or sedimentary interfaces. At 90 m depth in the margin site, stimulation was such that prokaryote numbers were higher ( about 13-fold) and activity rates higher than or similar to near-surface values. Analysis of high-molecular-mass DNA confirmed the presence of viable prokaryotes and showed changes in biodiversity with depth that were coupled to geochemistry, including a marked community change at the 90-m interface. At the open ocean site, increases in numbers of prokaryotes at depth were more restricted but also corresponded to increased activity; however, this time they were associated with repeating layers of diatom-rich sediments ( about 9 Myr old). These results show that deep sedimentary prokaryotes can have high activity, have changing diversity associated with interfaces and are active over geological timescales.","Cardiff Univ, Sch Earth Ocean & Planetary Sci, Cardiff CF10 3YE, Wales; Cardiff Univ, Cardiff Sch Biosci, Cardiff CF10 3TL, Wales; Max Planck Inst Marine Microbiol, D-28359 Bremen, Germany; Moss Landing Marine Labs, Moss Landing, CA 95039 USA","Parkes, RJ (reprint author), Cardiff Univ, Sch Earth Ocean & Planetary Sci, Main Bldg,Pk Pl, Cardiff CF10 3YE, Wales.",j.parkes@earth.cf.ac.uk,"Webster, Gordon/A-1877-2008; Cragg, Barry/D-2690-2009; Weightman, Andrew/A-2970-2010; Parkes, Ronald/B-1731-2010; Kallmeyer, Jens/I-3554-2012; Ferdelman, Timothy/A-3758-2013; Jorgensen, Bo/C-2214-2013","Webster, Gordon/0000-0002-9530-7835; Weightman, Andrew/0000-0002-6671-2209; Parkes, Ronald/0000-0001-9402-5943; Kallmeyer, Jens/0000-0002-6440-1140; Jorgensen, Bo/0000-0001-9398-8027",,,,30,259,276,2,47,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,21-Jul,2005,436,7049,,,,,390,394,,10.1038/nature03796,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,947DK,WOS:000230623400042,16034418,No,,,11/20/17

During courtship, Drosophila males engage in a series of innate, stereotyped behaviours that are coordinated by specific sensory cues. However, little is known about the specific neural substrates mediating this complex behavioural programme(1). Genetic, developmental and behavioural studies have shown that the fruitless (fru) gene encodes a set of male-specific transcription factors (Fru(M)) that act to establish the potential for courtship in Drosophila(2). Fru(M) proteins are expressed in similar to 2% of central nervous system neurons, at least one subset of which coordinates the component behaviours of courtship(3,4). Here we have inserted the yeast GAL4 gene into the fru locus by homologous recombination and show that ( 1) Fru(M) is expressed in subsets of all peripheral sensory systems previously implicated in courtship, ( 2) inhibition of Fru(M) function in olfactory system components reduces olfactory-dependent changes in courtship behaviour, ( 3) transient inactivation of all Fru(M)-expressing neurons abolishes courtship behaviour, with no other gross changes in general behaviour, and ( 4) 'masculinization' of Fru(M)-expressing neurons in females is largely sufficient to confer male courtship behaviour. Together, these data demonstrate that Fru(M) proteins specify the neural substrates of male courtship.","Stanford Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; Stanford Univ, Neurosci Program, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; Oregon State Univ, Dept Zool, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA; Brandeis Univ, Dept Biol, Waltham, MA 02254 USA","Baker, BS (reprint author), Stanford Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",bbaker@pmgm2.stanford.edu,,"Manoli, Devanand/0000-0002-7238-2330",,,,30,218,225,2,28,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,21-Jul,2005,436,7049,,,,,395,400,,10.1038/nature03859,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,947DK,WOS:000230623400043,15959468,No,,,11/20/17

Endothelial syncytia, comprised of multinucleated giant-endothelial cells, are frequently found in NiV infections, and are mediated by the fusion ( F) and attachment ( G) envelope glycoproteins. Identification of the receptor for this virus will shed light on the pathobiology of NiV infection, and spur the rational development of effective therapeutics. Here we report that ephrinB2, the membrane-bound ligand for the EphB class of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs)(3), specifically binds to the attachment (G) glycoprotein of NiV. Soluble Fc-fusion proteins of ephrinB2, but not ephrinB1, effectively block NiV fusion and entry into permissive cell types. Moreover, transfection of ephrinB2 into non-permissive cells renders them permissive for NiV fusion and entry. EphrinB2 is expressed on endothelial cells and neurons(3,4), which is consistent with the known cellular tropism for NiV5. Significantly, we find that NiV-envelope-mediated infection of microvascular endothelial cells and primary cortical rat neurons is inhibited by soluble ephrinB2, but not by the related ephrinB1 protein.

Although the structurally diverse lipids of the M. tuberculosis cell envelope each have non-redundant roles in virulence or persistence(2-7), the molecular mechanisms regulating cell envelope composition in M. tuberculosis are undefined. In higher eukaryotes, membrane composition is controlled by site two protease (S2P)-mediated cleavage of sterol regulatory element binding proteins(8,9), membrane-bound transcription factors that control lipid biosynthesis. S2P is the founding member of a widely distributed family of membrane metalloproteases(10,11) that cleave substrate proteins within transmembrane segments(12). Here we show that a previously uncharacterized M. tuberculosis S2P homologue (Rv2869c) regulates M. tuberculosis cell envelope composition, growth in vivo and persistence in vivo.

During fusion of model membranes or viruses, membranes dock, the outer membrane leaflets mix ( termed hemifusion), and finally the fusion pore opens and the contents mix(1,2). Viral fusion proteins consist of a membrane-disturbing 'fusion peptide' and a helical bundle that pin the membranes together(2-4). Although SNARE ( soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor) complexes form helical bundles with similar topology, it is unknown whether SNARE-dependent fusion events on intracellular membranes proceed through a hemifusion state. Here we identify the first hemifusion state for SNARE-dependent fusion of native membranes, and place it into a sequence of molecular events: formation of helical bundles by SNAREs precedes hemifusion; further progression to pore opening requires additional peptides. Thus, SNARE-dependent fusion may proceed along the same pathway as viral fusion: both use a docking mechanism via helical bundles(5,6) and additional peptides to destabilize the membrane and efficiently induce lipid mixing(7-9). Our results suggest that a common lipidic intermediate(3) may underlie all fusion reactions of lipid bilayers.","Univ Lausanne, Dept Biochim, CH-1066 Epalinges, Switzerland; Univ Heidelberg, Zentrum Biochem, D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany","Mayer, A (reprint author), Univ Lausanne, Dept Biochim, Chemin Boveresses 155, CH-1066 Epalinges, Switzerland.",Andreas.Mayer@unil.ch,,,,,,30,79,83,0,8,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,21-Jul,2005,436,7049,,,,,410,414,,10.1038/nature03722,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,947DK,WOS:000230623400046,15924133,No,,,11/20/17

In the inactive (GDP-bound) conformation, accessory factors facilitate the targeting of Rab GTPases to intracellular compartments(3-8). After nucleotide exchange to the active (GTP-bound) conformation, Rab GTPases interact with functionally diverse effectors including lipid kinases, motor proteins and tethering complexes. How effectors distinguish between homologous Rab GTPases represents an unresolved problem with respect to the specificity of vesicular trafficking. Using a structural proteomic approach, we have determined the specificity and structural basis underlying the interaction of the multivalent effector rabenosyn-5 with the Rab family. The results demonstrate that even the structurally similar effector domains in rabenosyn-5 can achieve highly selective recognition of distinct subsets of Rab GTPases exclusively through interactions with the switch and interswitch regions. The observed specificity is determined at a family-wide level by structural diversity in the active conformation, which governs the spatial disposition of critical conserved recognition determinants, and by a small number of both positive and negative sequence determinants that allow further discrimination between Rab GTPases with similar switch conformations.","Univ Massachusetts, Sch Med, Program Mol Med, Worcester, MA 01605 USA; Univ Massachusetts, Sch Med, Dept Mol Pharmacol & Biochem, Worcester, MA 01605 USA","Lambright, DG (reprint author), Univ Massachusetts, Sch Med, Program Mol Med, Worcester, MA 01605 USA.",David.Lambright@umassmed.edu,,,NIAID NIH HHS [P30 AI042845]; NIGMS NIH HHS [R01 GM056324],,,30,121,134,0,12,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,21-Jul,2005,436,7049,,,,,415,419,,10.1038/nature03798,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,947DK,WOS:000230623400047,16034420,No,,,11/20/17

Motivated by the discovery that certain bacterial CLC proteins are secondary active Cl-/H+ antiporters(5), we hypothesized that mammalian CLC proteins might not be classical Cl- ion channels but might exhibit Cl-- coupled proton transport activity. Here we report that ClC-4 and ClC-5 carry a substantial amount of protons across the plasma membrane when activated by positive voltages, as revealed by measurements of pH close to the cell surface. Both proteins are able to extrude protons against their electrochemical gradient, demonstrating secondary active transport. H+, but not Cl-, transport was abolished when a pore glutamate was mutated to alanine (E211A). ClC-0, ClC-2 and ClC-Ka proteins showed no significant proton transport. The muscle channel ClC-1 exhibited a small H+ transport that might be physiologically relevant. For ClC-5, we estimated that Cl- and H+ transport contribute about equally to the total charge movement, raising the possibility that the coupled Cl-/H+ transport of ClC-4 and ClC-5 is of significant magnitude in vivo.","CNR, Ist Biofis, I-16149 Genoa, Italy","Pusch, M (reprint author), CNR, Ist Biofis, Via Marini 6, I-16149 Genoa, Italy.",pusch@ge.ibf.cnr.it,"Picollo, Alessandra/G-1709-2014","Pusch, Michael/0000-0002-8644-8847; picollo, alessandra/0000-0003-2980-7951",Telethon [GGP04018],,,30,313,325,1,17,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,21-Jul,2005,436,7049,,,,,420,423,,10.1038/nature03720,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,947DK,WOS:000230623400048,16034421,No,,,11/20/17

Neutralization of a critical glutamate residue not only abolished the steep voltage-dependence of transport(7), but also eliminated the coupling of anion flux to proton counter-transport.

Two main bypasses are controlled by ubiquitin modification of proliferating cell nuclear antigen ( PCNA), a homotrimeric DNA-encircling protein that functions as a polymerase processivity factor and regulator of replication-linked functions(4,5). Upon DNA damage, PCNA is modified at the conserved lysine residue 164 by either mono-ubiquitin or a lysine-63-linked multi-ubiquitin chain(5), which induce error-prone or error-free replication bypasses of the lesions(5,6). In S phase, even in the absence of exogenous DNA damage, yeast PCNA can be alternatively modified by the small ubiquitin-related modifier protein SUMO5; however the consequences of this remain controversial(5-7). Here we show by genetic analysis that SUMO-modified PCNA functionally cooperates with Srs2, a helicase that blocks recombinational repair by disrupting Rad51 nucleoprotein filaments(8,9). Moreover, Srs2 displays a preference for interacting directly with the SUMO-modified form of PCNA, owing to a specific binding site in its carboxy-terminal tail. Our finding suggests a model in which SUMO-modified PCNA recruits Srs2 in S phase in order to prevent unwanted recombination events of replicating chromosomes.","Max Planck Inst Biochem, Dept Mol Cell Biol, D-82152 Martinsried, Germany","Jentsch, S (reprint author), Max Planck Inst Biochem, Dept Mol Cell Biol, Klopferspitz 18, D-82152 Martinsried, Germany.",Jentsch@biochem.mpg.de,"Pfander, Boris/A-8703-2013","George-Lucian, Moldovan/0000-0003-3825-149X",,,,28,388,403,4,18,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,21-Jul,2005,436,7049,,,,,428,433,,10.1038/nature03665,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,947DK,WOS:000230623400050,15931174,No,,,11/20/17

Using a new algorithm for microRNA target identification that incorporates features of RNA structure and target accessibility, we show that Hand2, a transcription factor that promotes ventricular cardiomyocyte expansion, is a target of miR-1. This work suggests that miR-1 genes titrate the effects of critical cardiac regulatory proteins to control the balance between differentiation and proliferation during cardiogenesis.","Univ Texas, SW Med Ctr, Dept Pediat Cardiol, Dallas, TX 75390 USA; Univ Texas, SW Med Ctr, Dept Mol Biol, Dallas, TX 75390 USA; Childrens Med Ctr Dallas, Dallas, TX 75390 USA","Srivastava, D (reprint author), Univ Calif San Francisco, Gladstone Inst Cardiovasc Dis, 1650 Owens St, San Francisco, CA 94158 USA.",dsrivastava@gladstone.ucsf.edu,,,,,,49,1043,1168,2,47,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,14-Jul,2005,436,7048,,,,,214,220,,10.1038/nature03817,,7,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,944VR,WOS:000230459500031,15951802,No,,,11/20/17

The tumours result from SB insertional mutagenesis of cancer genes, thus facilitating the identification of genes and pathways that induce disease. SB transposition can easily be controlled to mutagenize any target tissue and can therefore, in principle, be used to induce many of the cancers affecting humans, including those for which little is known about the aetiology.

Here we present two-dimensional spectroscopy of a star-forming galaxy(4) at redshift z = 3.09 ( seen 11.5 gigayears ago, when the Universe was 20 per cent of its current age): its spatially extended Ly alpha line emission appears to be absorbed by HI in a foreground screen covering the entire galaxy, with a lateral extent of at least 100 kpc and remarkable velocity coherence. This screen was ejected from the galaxy during a starburst several 10(8) years earlier and has subsequently swept up gas from the surrounding intergalactic medium and cooled.

At such distances, there exists a sufficient amount of solid material to produce a core capable of capturing enough gas to form a giant planet. Subsequently, they migrate inward to their present close orbits(3). Here I report the detection of an unusual hot Jupiter orbiting the primary star of a triple stellar system, HD 188753.

Femtosecond laser optical frequency 'combs' ( evenly spaced spectral lines) have revolutionized the measurement of optical frequencies(1,2) and enabled optical atomic clocks(3). The same comb techniques have been used to control the waveform of ultrafast laser pulses, which permitted the generation of single attosecond pulses(4), and have been used in a recently demonstrated 'oscilloscope' for light waves(5). Here we demonstrate intra-cavity high harmonic generation in the extreme ultraviolet, which promises to lead to another joint frontier of precision spectroscopy and ultrafast science. We have generated coherent extreme ultraviolet radiation at a repetition frequency of more than 100 MHz, a 1,000-fold improvement over previous experiments(6). At such a repetition rate, the mode spacing of the frequency comb, which is expected to survive the high harmonic generation process, is large enough for high resolution spectroscopy. Additionally, there may be many other applications of such a quasi-continuous compact and coherent extreme ultraviolet source, including extreme ultraviolet holography, microscopy, nanolithography and X-ray atomic clocks.","Max Planck Inst Quantum Opt, D-85748 Garching, Germany; Univ Munich, Dept Phys, D-85748 Garching, Germany","Gohle, C (reprint author), Max Planck Inst Quantum Opt, Hans Kopfermann Str 1, D-85748 Garching, Germany.",ctg@mpq.mpg.de,"Rauschenberger, Jens/C-4078-2011; Herrmann, Maximilian/B-2315-2008","Gohle, Christoph/0000-0002-4616-4292",,,,30,356,363,4,90,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,14-Jul,2005,436,7048,,,,,234,237,,10.1038/nature03851,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,944VR,WOS:000230459500035,16015324,No,,,11/20/17

One of the advantages of MOMs compared to other microporous materials, such as activated carbons, is their ability to exhibit a variety of pore surface properties such as hydrophilicity and chirality, as a result of the controlled incorporation of organic functional groups into the pore walls(11,13-15). This capability means that the pore surfaces of MOMs could be designed to adsorb specific molecules; but few design strategies for the adsorption of small molecules have been established so far. Here we report high levels of selective sorption of acetylene molecules as compared to a very similar molecule, carbon dioxide, onto the functionalized surface of a MOM. The acetylene molecules are held at a periodic distance from one another by hydrogen bonding between two non-coordinated oxygen atoms in the nanoscale pore wall of the MOM and the two hydrogen atoms of the acetylene molecule. This permits the stable storage of acetylene at a density 200 times the safe compression limit of free acetylene at room temperature.","Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Engn, Dept Synthet Chem & Biol Chem, Kyoto 6158510, Japan; Osaka Prefecture Univ, Grad Sch Sci, Dept Phys Sci, Osaka 5900035, Japan; Tohoku Univ, Inst Mat Res, Sendai, Miyagi 9808577, Japan; Okayama Univ, Fac Sci, Dept Phys, Okayama 7008530, Japan; Japan Synchrotron Radiat Res Inst SPring8, Sayo, Hyogo 6795198, Japan; Japan Sci & Technol Agcy, CREST, Tokyo, Japan; Osaka Univ, Grad Sch Engn Sci, Dept Mat Engn, Div Mat Phys, Osaka 5608531, Japan","Kitagawa, S (reprint author), Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Engn, Dept Synthet Chem & Biol Chem, Kyoto 6158510, Japan.",kitagawa@sbchem.kyoto-u.ac.jp,"Kitagawa, Susumu/C-2468-2009; Kawazoe, Yoshiyuki/C-2998-2011; KOBAYASHI, Tatsuo/B-1527-2011; Belosludov, Rodion/A-1748-2013; Sakamoto, Hirotoshi/K-2516-2017; Kitaura, Ryo/B-8123-2008","Sakamoto, Hirotoshi/0000-0002-0873-1321; ",,,,30,954,961,18,287,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,14-Jul,2005,436,7048,,,,,238,241,,10.1038/nature03852,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,944VR,WOS:000230459500036,16015325,No,,,11/20/17

It is difficult to test this assumption, because of the paucity of long, continuous climate records from the Southern Hemisphere that have not been dated by tuning them to the presumed Northern Hemisphere signals(2). Here we present an independently dated terrestrial pollen record from a peat bog on South Island, New Zealand, to investigate global and local factors in Southern Hemisphere climate changes during the last two glacial - interglacial cycles. Our record largely corroborates the Milankovitch model of orbital forcing but also exhibits some differences: in particular, an earlier onset and longer duration of the Last Glacial Maximum. Our results suggest that Southern Hemisphere insolation may have been responsible for these differences in timing. Our findings question the validity of applying orbital tuning to Southern Hemisphere records and suggest an alternative mechanism to the bipolar seesaw for generating interhemispheric asynchrony in climate change.","Univ Maine, Climate Change Inst, Orono, ME 04469 USA; Univ Plymouth, Sch Geog, Plymouth PL4 8AA, Devon, England; Univ Bern, Inst Geol Sci, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland; Univ Waikato, Radiocarbon Dating Lab, Hamilton, New Zealand; Univ Cincinnati, Dept Geol, Cincinnati, OH 45221 USA; Univ Otago, Dept Geog, Dunedin, New Zealand; Univ Cologne, Inst Geol, D-50674 Cologne, Germany","Vandergoes, MJ (reprint author), Univ Maine, Climate Change Inst, Orono, ME 04469 USA.",vandergoes@maine.edu,"Fitzsimons, Sean/C-4024-2009; Newnham, Rewi/F-1111-2011","Lowell, Thomas/0000-0001-7826-0636",,,,29,84,87,17,71,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,14-Jul,2005,436,7048,,,,,242,245,,10.1038/nature03826,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,944VR,WOS:000230459500037,16015326,No,,,11/20/17

Examination of early Archaean rocks from West Greenland (3.6 - 3.8 Gyr old) using short-lived Sm-146 - Nd-142 chronometry indicates that an episode of mantle differentiation took place close to the end of accretion (4.46 +/- 0.11 Gyr ago)(2-4). This has produced a chemically depleted mantle with an Sm/Nd ratio higher than the chondritic value. In contrast, application of Lu-176 - Hf-176 systematics to 3.6 - 3.8-Gyr-old zircons from West Greenland indicates derivation from a mantle source with a chondritic Lu/Hf ratio(5-7). Although an early Sm/Nd fractionation could be explained by basaltic crust formation(8), magma ocean crystallization(2) or formation of continental crust, the absence of coeval Lu/Hf fractionation is in sharp contrast with the well-known covariant behaviour of Sm/Nd and Lu/Hf ratios in crustal formation processes(5). Here we show using mineral - melt partitioning data for high-pressure mantle minerals that the observed Nd and Hf signatures could have been produced by segregation of melt from a crystallizing magma ocean at upper-mantle pressures early in Earth's history.

The Siberian Traps at the Permian Triassic boundary(2) and the Deccan Traps at the Cretaceous Tertiary boundary(3) were probably erupted within one million years. These large eruptions have been linked to mass extinctions. But recent geochronological data(4-11) reveal more than one pulse of major eruptions with diverse magma flux within several flood basalts extending over tens of million years. This observation indicates that the processes leading to large igneous provinces are more complicated than the purely thermal, single-stage plume model suggests. Here we present numerical experiments to demonstrate that the entrainment of a dense eclogite-derived material at the base of the mantle by thermal plumes can develop secondary instabilities due to the interaction between thermal and compositional buoyancy forces. The characteristic timescales of the development of the secondary instabilities and the variation of the plume strength are compatible with the observations.

The avian respiratory system includes high-compliance air sacs that ventilate a dorsally fixed, non-expanding parabronchial lung(2,3,5,6). Caudally positioned abdominal and thoracic air sacs are critical components of the avian aspiration pump, facilitating flow-through ventilation of the lung and near-constant airflow during both inspiration and expiration, highlighting a design optimized for efficient gas exchange(2,5-8). Postcranial skeletal pneumaticity has also been reported in numerous extinct archosaurs including non-avian theropod dinosaurs and Archaeopteryx(9-12). However, the relationship between osseous pneumaticity and the evolution of the avian respiratory apparatus has long remained ambiguous. Here we report, on the basis of a comparative analysis of region-specific pneumaticity with extant birds, evidence for cervical and abdominal air-sac systems in non-avian theropods, along with thoracic skeletal prerequisites of an avian-style aspiration pump. The early acquisition of this system among theropods is demonstrated by examination of an exceptional new specimen of Majungatholus atopus, documenting these features in a taxon only distantly related to birds. Taken together, these specializations imply the existence of the basic avian pulmonary Bauplan in basal neotheropods, indicating that flow-through ventilation of the lung is not restricted to birds but is probably a general theropod characteristic.","Ohio Univ, Coll Osteopath Med, Dept Biomed Sci, Athens, OH 45701 USA; Harvard Univ, Museum Comparat Zool, Dept Organism & Evolutionary Biol, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA","O'Connor, PM (reprint author), Ohio Univ, Coll Osteopath Med, Dept Biomed Sci, 228 Irvine Hall, Athens, OH 45701 USA.",oconnorp@ohiou.edu,"Claessens, Leon/F-5036-2012; OConnor, Patrick/I-9383-2012","OConnor, Patrick/0000-0002-6762-3806; Claessens, Leon/0000-0002-1873-6070",,,,30,108,113,3,49,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,14-Jul,2005,436,7048,,,,,253,256,,10.1038/nature03716,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,944VR,WOS:000230459500040,16015329,No,,,11/20/17

CI can also occur between Wolbachia-infected populations and is usually associated with the presence of different Wolbachia strains(1). In the Culex pipiens mosquito group ( including the filariasis vector C. quinquefasciatus) a very unusual degree of complexity of Wolbachia-induced crossing-types has been reported, with partial or complete CI that can be unidirectional or bidirectional(6-11), yet no Wolbachia strain variation was found(11).

Although experience plays an important role in modifying synaptic connectivity(6-17), its effect on this nearly lifelong synapse loss remains unknown. Here we used transcranial two-photon microscopy to visualize postsynaptic dendritic spines in layer I of the barrel cortex in transgenic mice expressing yellow fluorescent protein. We show that in young adolescent mice, long-term sensory deprivation through whisker trimming prevents net spine loss by preferentially reducing the rate of ongoing spine elimination, not by increasing the rate of spine formation. This effect of deprivation diminishes as animals mature but still persists in adulthood. Restoring sensory experience after adolescent deprivation accelerates spine elimination. Similar to sensory manipulation, the rate of spine elimination decreases after chronic blockade of NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) receptors with the antagonist MK801, and accelerates after drug withdrawal. These studies of spine dynamics in the primary somatosensory cortex suggest that experience plays an important role in the net loss of synapses over most of an animal's lifespan, particularly during adolescence.","NYU, Sch Med, Skirball Inst,Dept Physiol & Neurosci, Mol Neurobiol Program, New York, NY 10016 USA","Zuo, Y (reprint author), NYU, Sch Med, Skirball Inst,Dept Physiol & Neurosci, Mol Neurobiol Program, 540 1st Ave, New York, NY 10016 USA.",,,"Yang, Guang/0000-0002-5739-9126",,,,30,258,265,1,23,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,14-Jul,2005,436,7048,,,,,261,265,,10.1038/nature03715,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,944VR,WOS:000230459500042,16015331,No,,,11/20/17

Here we show that in CNS inflammation, NPCs are able to promote neuroprotection by maintaining undifferentiated features and exerting unexpected immune-like functions. In a mouse model of chronic CNS inflammation, systemically injected adult syngeneic NPCs use constitutively activated integrins and functional chemokine receptors to selectively enter the inflamed CNS. These undifferentiated cells survive repeated episodes of CNS inflammation by accumulating within perivascular areas where reactive astrocytes, inflamed endothelial cells and encephalitogenic T cells produce neurogenic and gliogenic regulators. In perivascular CNS areas, surviving adult NPCs induce apoptosis of blood-borne CNS-infiltrating encephalitogenic T cells, thus protecting against chronic neural tissue loss as well as disease-related disability. These results indicate that undifferentiated adult NPCs have relevant therapeutic potential in chronic inflammatory CNS disorders because they display immune-like functions that promote long-lasting neuroprotection.","Vita Salute Univ, Hosp San Raffaele, Neuroimmunol Unit DIBIT, I-20132 Milan, Italy; Vita Salute Univ, Hosp San Raffaele, Dept Neurol, I-20132 Milan, Italy; Vita Salute Univ, Hosp San Raffaele, Dept Neurophysiol, I-20132 Milan, Italy; Univ Verona, Dept Pathol, Sect Gen Pathol, I-37134 Verona, Italy","Martino, G (reprint author), Vita Salute Univ, Hosp San Raffaele, Neuroimmunol Unit DIBIT, Via Olgettina 58, I-20132 Milan, Italy.",martino.gianvito@hsr.it,"Furlan, Roberto/J-9177-2016","Furlan, Roberto/0000-0001-7376-9425; cattalini, alessandro/0000-0001-7585-1780; OTTOBONI, LINDA/0000-0001-5412-7785; Martinello, Marianna/0000-0001-9811-6308",,,,27,518,536,4,19,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,14-Jul,2005,436,7048,,,,,266,271,,10.1038/nature03889,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,944VR,WOS:000230459500043,16015332,No,,,11/20/17

Of the three cardinal limb axes, the mechanisms that lead to establishment and patterning of skeletal elements along the P - D axis are the least understood. Here we identify a genetic interaction between Gli3 (GLI-Kruppel family member 3) and Plzf ( promyelocytic leukaemia zinc finger, also known as Zbtb16 and Zfp145), which is required specifically at very early stages of limb development for all proximal cartilage condensations in the hindlimb ( femur, tibia, fibula). Notably, distal condensations comprising the foot are relatively unperturbed in Gli3(-/-); Plzf(-/-) mouse embryos. We demonstrate that the cooperative activity of Gli3 and Plzf establishes the correct temporal and spatial distribution of chondrocyte progenitors in the proximal limb-bud independently of known P - D patterning markers and overall limb-bud size. Moreover, the limb defects in Gli3(-/-); Plzf(-/-) embryos correlate with the transient death of a specific subset of proximal mesenchymal cells that express bone morphogenetic protein receptor, type 1B (Bmpr1b) at the onset of limb development. These findings suggest that the development of proximal and distal skeletal elements is distinctly regulated early during limb-bud formation. The initial division of the vertebrate limb into two distinct molecular domains is consistent with fossil evidence indicating that the upper and lower extremities of the limb have different evolutionary origins(2).","Sloan Kettering Inst, Dev Biol Program, New York, NY 10021 USA; Sloan Kettering Inst, Canc Biol & Genet Program, New York, NY 10021 USA; Sloan Kettering Inst, Dept Pathol, New York, NY 10021 USA; Cornell Univ, Weill Grad Sch Med Sci, Program Mol Biol, New York, NY 10021 USA; Univ Colorado, Hlth Sci Ctr, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Aurora, CO 80045 USA; Univ Colorado, Hlth Sci Ctr, Dept Pediat, Sect Dev Biol, Aurora, CO 80045 USA","Niswander, L (reprint author), Sloan Kettering Inst, Dev Biol Program, New York, NY 10021 USA.",Lee.Niswander@uchsc.edu,"Niswander, Lee/D-3976-2013",,,,,26,64,66,0,6,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,14-Jul,2005,436,7048,,,,,277,281,,10.1038/nature03801,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,944VR,WOS:000230459500045,16015334,No,,,11/20/17

Autonomous DNA type transposons encode a transposase that enables them to mobilize to a new chromosomal position in the host genome by a cut-and-paste mechanism. As this is potentially mutagenic, the host limits transposition through epigenetic gene silencing and heterochromatin formation. Here we show that a transposase from Arabidopsis thaliana that we named DAYSLEEPER is essential for normal plant growth; it shares several characteristics with the hAT ( hobo, Activator, Tam3) family of transposases(1). DAYSLEEPER was isolated as a factor binding to a motif (Kubox1) present in the upstream region of the Arabidopsis DNA repair gene Ku70 ( refs 2, 3). This motif is also present in the upstream regions of many other plant genes. Plants lacking DAYSLEEPER or strongly overexpressing this gene do not develop in a normal manner. Furthermore, DAYSLEEPER overexpression results in the altered expression of many genes. Our data indicate that transposase-like genes can be essential for plant development and can also regulate global gene expression. Thus, transposases can become domesticated by the host to fulfil important cellular functions.","Leiden Univ, Inst Biol, NL-2333 AL Leiden, Netherlands","Hooykaas, P (reprint author), Leiden Univ, Inst Biol, Wassenaarseweg 64, NL-2333 AL Leiden, Netherlands.",hooykaas@rulbim.leidenuniv.nl,"Hooykaas, Paul/S-4256-2017","Hooykaas, Paul/0000-0002-9736-6927",,,,16,72,79,0,10,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,14-Jul,2005,436,7048,,,,,282,284,,10.1038/nature03667,,3,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,944VR,WOS:000230459500046,16015335,No,,,11/20/17

Despite such sequence diversity, these signals are all recognized and interpreted by a highly conserved protein-conducting channel composed of the Sec61 complex(3,4). Signal recognition by Sec61 is essential for productive insertion of the nascent polypeptide into the translocation site(5), channel gating(6) and initiation of transport. Although subtle differences in these steps can be detected between different substrates(7,8), it is not known whether they can be exploited to modulate protein translocation selectively. Here we describe cotransin, a small molecule that inhibits protein translocation into the endoplasmic reticulum. Cotransin acts in a signal-sequence-discriminatory manner to prevent the stable insertion of select nascent chains into the Sec61 translocation channel. Thus, the range of substrates accommodated by the channel can be specifically and reversibly modulated by a cell-permeable small molecule that alters the interaction between signal sequences and the Sec61 complex.","NICHD, Cell Biol & Metab Branch, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; Univ Calif San Francisco, Chem & Chem Biol Grad Program, San Francisco, CA 94107 USA; Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Mol & Cellular Pharmacol, San Francisco, CA 94107 USA; Bioseek Inc, Burlingame, CA 94010 USA","Hegde, RS (reprint author), NICHD, Cell Biol & Metab Branch, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA.",hegder@mail.nih.gov; taunton@cmp.ucsf.edu,,"Hegde, Ramanujan/0000-0001-8338-852X",,,,28,83,85,1,9,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,14-Jul,2005,436,7048,,,,,285,289,,10.1038/nature03821,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,944VR,WOS:000230459500047,16015336,No,,,11/20/17

We have recently identified CAM741, a derivative of a fungus-derived cyclopeptolide that acts as a selective inhibitor of VCAM1 synthesis in endothelial cells. Here we show that the compound represses the biosynthesis of VCAM1 in cells by blocking the process of cotranslational translocation, which is dependent on the signal peptide of VCAM1. CAM741 does not inhibit targeting of the VCAM1 nascent chains to the translocon channel but prevents translocation to the luminal side of the endoplasmic reticulum ( ER), through a process that involves the translocon component Sec61 beta. Consequently, the VCAM1 precursor protein is synthesized towards the cytosolic compartment of the cells, where it is degraded. Our results indicate that the inhibition of cotranslational translocation with low-molecular-mass compounds, using specificity conferred by signal peptides, can modulate the biosynthesis of certain secreted and/or membrane proteins. In addition, they highlight cotranslational translocation at the ER membrane as a potential target for drug discovery.","Novartis Inst Biomed Res, A-1235 Vienna, Austria","de Vries, JE (reprint author), Novartis Inst Biomed Res, Brunner Str 59, A-1235 Vienna, Austria.",jan.devries@novartis.com,,,,,,15,74,76,1,2,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,14-Jul,2005,436,7048,,,,,290,293,,10.1038/nature03670,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,944VR,WOS:000230459500048,16015337,No,,,11/20/17

However, the packaging of DNA into nucleosomes is a significant barrier to DNA repair, and the mechanisms of repair in the context of chromatin are poorly understood(1). Here we show that lysine 56 (K56) acetylation is an abundant modification of newly synthesized histone H3 molecules that are incorporated into chromosomes during S phase. Defects in the acetylation of K56 in histone H3 result in sensitivity to genotoxic agents that cause DNA strand breaks during replication. In the absence of DNA damage, the acetylation of histone H3 K56 largely disappears in G2. In contrast, cells with DNA breaks maintain high levels of acetylation, and the persistence of the modification is dependent on DNA damage checkpoint proteins. We suggest that the acetylation of histone H3 K56 creates a favourable chromatin environment for DNA repair and that a key component of the DNA damage response is to preserve this acetylation.","Canc Res UK, London Res Inst, Clare Hall Labs, Chromosome Dynam Lab, S Mimms EN6 3LD, Herts, England; Univ Texas, MD Anderson Canc Ctr, Dept Mol Pathol, Houston, TX 77030 USA","Verreault, A (reprint author), Canc Res UK, London Res Inst, Clare Hall Labs, Chromosome Dynam Lab, Blanche Lane, S Mimms EN6 3LD, Herts, England.",alain.verreault@cancer.org.uk,,"Hawke, David/0000-0002-6102-7843",,,,21,369,372,1,10,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,14-Jul,2005,436,7048,,,,,294,298,,10.1038/nature03714,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,944VR,WOS:000230459500049,16015338,No,,,11/20/17

Because the apparent angular diameter of the satellites is much smaller than that of the Sun, however, such events are more appropriately referred to as transits. Transit data can be used for correcting and refining the orbital ephemerides of the moons. For example, Phobos is known to exhibit a secular acceleration that is caused by tidal dissipation within Mars(2-4). Long-term, accurate measurements are needed to refine the magnitude and origin of this dissipation within the martian interior as well as to refine the predicted orbital evolution of both satellites(5,6).

They generally encode local differences in space and changes in time rather than the raw image intensity. This can be seen as a strategy of predictive coding, adapted through evolution to the average image statistics of the natural environment. Yet animals encounter many environments with visual statistics different from the average scene. Here we show that when this happens, the retina adjusts its processing dynamically. The spatio-temporal receptive fields of retinal ganglion cells change after a few seconds in a new environment. The changes are adaptive, in that the new receptive field improves predictive coding under the new image statistics. We show that a network model with plastic synapses can account for the large variety of observed adaptations.","Harvard Univ, Dept Mol & Cellular Biol, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; Stanford Univ, Dept Neurobiol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA","Meister, M (reprint author), Harvard Univ, Dept Mol & Cellular Biol, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",meister@fas.harvard.edu,,"Meister, Markus/0000-0003-2136-6506",,,,38,219,227,1,40,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,7-Jul,2005,436,7047,,,,,71,77,,10.1038/nature03689,,7,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,942QJ,WOS:000230296600041,16001064,No,,,11/20/17

Using high-throughput RNA interference and automated image analysis, we explored the function of human kinases in two principal types of endocytosis: clathrin- and caveolae/raft-mediated endocytosis. We monitored this through infection of vesicular stomatitis virus, simian virus 40 and transferrin trafficking, and also through cell proliferation and apoptosis assays. Here we show that a high number of kinases are involved in endocytosis, and that each endocytic route is regulated by a specific kinase subset. Notably, one group of kinases exerted opposite effects on the two endocytic routes, suggesting coordinate regulation. Our analysis demonstrates that signalling functions such as those controlling cell adhesion, growth and proliferation, are built into the machinery of endocytosis to a much higher degree than previously recognized.","Max Planck Inst Mol Cell Biol & Genet, D-01307 Dresden, Germany; MPI CBG High Throughput Technol Dev Studio, D-01307 Dresden, Germany; Scionics Comp Innovat GmbH, D-01307 Dresden, Germany; Ceniix Biosci GmbH, D-01307 Dresden, Germany","Zerial, M (reprint author), Max Planck Inst Mol Cell Biol & Genet, Pfotenhauerstr 108, D-01307 Dresden, Germany.",zerial@mpi-cbg.de,"Habermann, Bianca/N-4886-2016","Habermann, Bianca/0000-0002-2457-7504",,,,51,440,461,3,30,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,7-Jul,2005,436,7047,,,,,78,86,,10.1038/nature03571,,9,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,942QJ,WOS:000230296600042,15889048,No,,,11/20/17

For example, a single electron on a metallic island can block the flow of another electron if the charging energy of the island greatly exceeds the thermal energy. The analogous effect of 'photon blockade' has been proposed for the transport of light through an optical system; this involves photon-photon interactions in a nonlinear optical cavity(4-13). Here we report observations of photon blockade for the light transmitted by an optical cavity containing one trapped atom, in the regime of strong atom cavity coupling(14). Excitation of the atom-cavity system by a first photon blocks the transmission of a second photon, thereby converting an incident poissonian stream of photons into a subpoissonian, anti-bunched stream. This is confirmed by measurements of the photon statistics of the transmitted field. Our observations of photon blockade represent an advance over traditional nonlinear optics and laser physics, into a regime with dynamical processes involving atoms and photons taken one-by-one.","CALTECH, Norman Bridge Lab Phys 12 23, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA","Kimble, HJ (reprint author), CALTECH, Norman Bridge Lab Phys 12 23, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA.",hjkimble@caltech.edu,"Northup, Tracy/N-1439-2017","Northup, Tracy/0000-0002-1071-2218",,,,24,571,582,11,79,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,7-Jul,2005,436,7047,,,,,87,90,,10.1038/nature03804,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,942QJ,WOS:000230296600043,16001065,No,,,11/20/17

This has stimulated similar efforts to dope semiconductor nanocrystals(1-4). Despite some successes(5-11), many of these efforts have failed, for reasons that remain unclear. For example, Mn can be incorporated into nanocrystals of CdS and ZnSe (refs 7-9), but not into CdSe (ref. 12)-despite comparable bulk solubilities of near 50 per cent. These difficulties, which have hindered development of new nanocrystalline materials(13-15), are often attributed to 'self-purification', an allegedly intrinsic mechanism whereby impurities are expelled. Here we show instead that the underlying mechanism that controls doping is the initial adsorption of impurities on the nanocrystal surface during growth. We find that adsorption-and therefore doping efficiency-is determined by three main factors: surface morphology, nanocrystal shape, and surfactants in the growth solution. Calculated Mn adsorption energies and equilibrium shapes for several nanocrystals lead to specific doping predictions. These are confirmed by measuring how the Mn concentration in ZnSe varies with nanocrystal size and shape. Finally, we use our predictions to incorporate Mn into previously undopable CdSe nanocrystals. This success establishes that earlier difficulties with doping are not intrinsic, and suggests that a variety of doped nanocrystals-for applications from solar cells(16) to spintronics(17)-can be anticipated.","USN, Res Lab, Washington, DC 20375 USA; Univ Minnesota, Dept Chem Engn & Mat Sci, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA","Erwin, SC (reprint author), USN, Res Lab, Washington, DC 20375 USA.",Steven.Erwin@nrl.navy.mil; dnorris@umn.edu,"Erwin, Steven/B-1850-2009; Norris, David/F-4022-2010","Norris, David/0000-0002-3765-0678",,,,30,996,1010,27,516,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,7-Jul,2005,436,7047,,,,,91,94,,10.1038/nature03832,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,942QJ,WOS:000230296600044,16001066,No,,,11/20/17

A possible explanation for such observations is that vesiculation occurs at great depths with noble-gas solubilities different from those measured at 1 bar (ref. 1). Here we develop a hard-sphere model for noble-gas solubility and find that, owing to melt compaction, solubility may decrease by several orders of magnitude when pressure increases, an effect subtly overbalanced by the compression of the fluid phase. Our results satisfactorily explain recent experimental data on argon solubility in silicate melts, where argon concentration increases almost linearly with pressure, then levels off at pressures of 50-100 kbar (refs 2-5). We also model vesiculation during magma ascent at ridges and find that noble-gas partitioning between melt and CO2 vesicles at depth differs significantly from that at low pressure. Starting at 10 kbar (similar to 35 km depth), several stages of vesiculation occur followed by vesicle loss, which explains the broad variability of He-Ar concentration data in mid-ocean ridge basalts. 'Popping rocks', exceptional samples with high vesicularity, may represent fully vesiculated ridge magma, whereas common samples would simply have lost such vesicles.","Univ Paris 11, Dept Sci Terre, Grp Geochim Gaz Rares, CNRS,UMR 8148,IDES, F-91405 Orsay, France; Univ Paris 06, CNRS, UMR 7600, Lab Phys Theor Mat Condensee, F-75252 Paris, France","Sarda, P (reprint author), Ecole Normale Super Lyon, CNRS, UMR 5570, Lab Sci Terre, F-69364 Lyon, France.",sarda@geophy.geol.u-psud.fr,,,,,,29,26,26,1,20,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,7-Jul,2005,436,7047,,,,,95,98,,10.1038/nature03636,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,942QJ,WOS:000230296600045,16001067,No,,,11/20/17

Consequently, few general hypotheses have been advanced to explain the large differences between species in the magnitude of population fluctuations(3-6). One reason for this is that the detection of density regulation in population time series is complicated by time lags induced by the life history of species(7,8) that make it difficult to separate the relative contributions of intrinsic and extrinsic factors to the population dynamics. Here we use population time series for 23 bird species to estimate parameters of a stochastic density-dependent age-structured model. We show that both the strength of total density dependence in the life history and the magnitude of environmental stochasticity, including transient fluctuations in age structure, increase with generation time. These results indicate that the relationships between demographic and life-history traits in birds(9,10) translate into distinct population dynamical patterns that are apparent only on a scale of generations.","Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Biol, N-7491 Trondheim, Norway; Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Biol 0116, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Math Sci, N-7491 Trondheim, Norway; CNRS, CEBC, FR-79360 Villiers En Bois, France; Univ Victoria, Dept Biol, Victoria, BC V8W 3N5, Canada; Inst Vogelforsch Vogelwarte Helgoland, D-26386 Wilhelmshaven, Germany; Natl Environm Res Inst, Dept Coastal Zone Ecol, DK-8410 Ronde, Denmark; Univ Helsinki, Dept Biol & Environm Sci, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland; Univ Oxford, Dept Zool, Oxford OX1 3PS, England; Umea Univ, Dept Ecol & Environm Sci, S-90187 Umea, Sweden; Loyalist Coll, Belleville, ON K8N 5B9, Canada; Queens Univ, Dept Biol, Kingston, ON K7L 3N6, Canada; Adam Mickiewicz Univ, Dept Behav Ecol, PL-61614 Poznan, Poland; Netherlands Inst Ecol, NL-6666 ZG Heteren, Netherlands","Saether, BE (reprint author), Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Biol, N-7491 Trondheim, Norway.",bernt-erik.sather@bio.ntnu.no,"Merila, Juha/A-4061-2008; Visser, Marcel/A-9151-2009; Tryjanowski, Piotr/C-1367-2009; Brommer, Jon/C-3613-2008; Bregnballe, Thomas/L-1890-2013","Merila, Juha/0000-0001-9614-0072; Visser, Marcel/0000-0002-1456-1939; Brommer, Jon/0000-0002-2435-2612; ",,,,30,93,96,3,47,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,7-Jul,2005,436,7047,,,,,99,102,,10.1038/nature03666,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,942QJ,WOS:000230296600046,16001068,No,,,11/20/17

Identifying the molecular mechanisms involved in nicotine reinforcement and cognition is a priority and requires the development of new in vivo experimental paradigms. The ventral tegmental area (VTA) of the midbrain is thought to mediate the reinforcement properties of many drugs of abuse. Here we specifically re-expressed the beta 2-subunit of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) by stereotaxically injecting a lentiviral vector into the VTA of mice carrying beta 2-subunit deletions(3,4). We demonstrate the efficient re-expression of electrophysiologically responsive, ligand-binding nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in dopamine-containing neurons of the VTA, together with the recovery of nicotine-elicited dopamine release and nicotine self-administration. We also quantified exploratory behaviours of the mice, and showed that beta 2-subunit re-expression restored slow exploratory behaviour (a measure of cognitive function) to wild-type levels, but did not affect fast navigation behaviour. We thus demonstrate the sufficient role of the VTA in both nicotine reinforcement and endogenous cholinergic regulation of cognitive functions.","Inst Pasteur, CNRS, URA 2182, Unite Recepteurs & Cognit, F-75724 Paris, France; Univ Paris Sud, Fac Pharm, Lab Neuropharmacol EA3544, F-92296 Chatenay Malabry, France; Univ Bordeaux 1, CNRS, UMR 5106, Cognit Neurosci Lab, F-33405 Talence, France; Hop La Pitie Salpetriere, CNRS, UMR 7091, Lab Genet Mol Neurotransmiss & Proc Neurodegenera, F-75013 Paris, France","Changeux, JP (reprint author), Inst Pasteur, CNRS, URA 2182, Unite Recepteurs & Cognit, 25 Rue Dr Roux, F-75724 Paris, France.",changeux@pasteur.fr,"Guilloux, Jean-Philippe/B-3726-2015; Guiard, Bruno/A-3955-2016","Guilloux, Jean-Philippe/0000-0003-0982-3751; Faure, Philippe/0000-0003-3573-4971; Bemelmans, Alexis/0000-0001-7605-5225",,,,30,355,362,2,29,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,7-Jul,2005,436,7047,,,,,103,107,,10.1038/nature03694,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,942QJ,WOS:000230296600047,16001069,No,,,11/20/17

In the periphery, ATP mediates nociception(3-5), mechanosensitivity(3,6), thermal sensitivity(7) and O-2 chemosensitivity(8). These processes share a common mechanism that involves the release of ATP to excite afferent fibres via activation of ionotropic P2X and/or metabotropic P2Y receptors. Chemosensors located in the brainstem are crucial for the maintenance of physiological levels of blood gases through the regulation of breathing(9-11). Here we show that an increase in p(CO 2) in the arterial blood triggers the immediate release of ATP from three chemosensitive regions located on the ventral surface of the medulla oblongata. Blockade of ATP receptors at these sites diminishes the chemosensory control of breathing, suggesting that ATP release constitutes a key step in central chemosensory transduction. These new data suggest that ATP, a phylogenetically ancient, unique and simple molecule, has been widely used in the evolution of afferent systems to mediate distinct forms of sensory transduction not only in the periphery but also within the central nervous system.","UCL Royal Free & UCL Med Sch, Dept Physiol, London NW3 2PF, England; Univ Warwick, Dept Biol Sci, Warwick Biosensor Grp, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England","Gourine, AV (reprint author), UCL Royal Free & UCL Med Sch, Dept Physiol, Rowland Hill St, London NW3 2PF, England.",a.gourine@medsch.ucl.ac.uk,"Dale, Nicholas/C-7772-2011","Dale, Nicholas/0000-0003-2196-2949; Llaudet, Enrique/0000-0003-1136-0602",Wellcome Trust,,,16,249,254,2,34,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,7-Jul,2005,436,7047,,,,,108,111,,10.1038/nature03690,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,942QJ,WOS:000230296600048,16001070,No,,,11/20/17

Predisposing factors for ARDS are diverse(1,3) and include sepsis, aspiration, pneumonias and infections with the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) corona-virus(4,5). At present, there are no effective drugs for improving the clinical outcome of ARDS(1-3). Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and ACE2 are homologues with different key functions in the renin-angiotensin system(6-8). ACE cleaves angiotensin I to generate angiotensin II, whereas ACE2 inactivates angiotensin II and is a negative regulator of the system. ACE2 has also recently been identified as a potential SARS virus receptor and is expressed in lungs(9,10). Here we report that ACE2 and the angiotensin II type 2 receptor (AT(2)) protect mice from severe acute lung injury induced by acid aspiration or sepsis. However, other components of the renin-angiotensin system, including ACE, angiotensin II and the angiotensin II type 1a receptor (AT(1)a), promote disease pathogenesis, induce lung oedemas and impair lung function. We show that mice deficient for Ace show markedly improved disease, and also that recombinant ACE2 can protect mice from severe acute lung injury. Our data identify a critical function for ACE2 in acute lung injury, pointing to a possible therapy for a syndrome affecting millions of people worldwide every year.","Austrian Acad Sci, IMBA, Inst Mol Biotechnol, A-1030 Vienna, Austria; Chinese Acad Med Sci, Inst Basic Med Sci, Natl Lab Med Mol Biol, Beijing 100005, Peoples R China; Peking Union Med Coll, Beijing 100005, Peoples R China; St Michaels Hosp, Dept Cardiol, Toronto, ON M5B 1W8, Canada; Merck Frosst Ctr Therapeut Res, Dept Biochem & Mol Biol, Montreal, PQ H3R 4P8, Canada; Univ Tsukuba, Ctr Tsukuba Adv Res Alliance, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058577, Japan; Hosp Sick Children, Program Dev Biol, Toronto, ON M5G 1X8, Canada; Univ Toronto, Dept Mol & Med Genet, Toronto, ON M5G 1X8, Canada; Univ Freiburg, Dept Pharmacol, D-79104 Freiburg, Germany; Res Ctr Borstel, Div Pulm Pharmacol, D-23845 Borstel, Germany; Univ Toronto, St Michaels Hosp, Dept Med, Toronto, ON M5B 1W8, Canada; Univ Toronto, St Michaels Hosp, Interdepartmental Div Crit Care, Toronto, ON M5B 1W8, Canada","Penninger, JM (reprint author), Austrian Acad Sci, IMBA, Inst Mol Biotechnol, A-1030 Vienna, Austria.",Josef.penninger@imba.oeaw.ac.at,"Slutsky, Arthur/A-6013-2008; Fukamizu, Akiyoshi/J-5350-2012; Penninger, Josef/I-6860-2013; Uhlig, Stefan/A-7290-2014","Slutsky, Arthur/0000-0002-6063-3876; Fukamizu, Akiyoshi/0000-0002-8786-6020; Penninger, Josef/0000-0002-8194-3777; Uhlig, Stefan/0000-0003-2332-1280",,,,30,335,383,2,32,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,7-Jul,2005,436,7047,,,,,112,116,,10.1038/nature03712,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,942QJ,WOS:000230296600049,16001071,No,,,11/20/17

High-density single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) arrays enable detailed and genome-wide identification of both loss-of-heterozygosity events and copy-number alterations in cancer(1-5). Here, by integrating SNP array-based genetic maps with gene expression signatures derived from NCI60 cell lines, we identified the melanocyte master regulator MITF (microphthalmia-associated transcription factor) as the target of a novel melanoma amplification. We found that MITF amplification was more prevalent in metastatic disease and correlated with decreased overall patient survival. BRAF mutation and p16 inactivation accompanied MITF amplification in melanoma cell lines. Ectopic MITF expression in conjunction with the BRAF(V600E) mutant transformed primary human melanocytes, and thus MITF can function as a melanoma oncogene. Reduction of MITF activity sensitizes melanoma cells to chemotherapeutic agents. Targeting MITF in combination with BRAF or cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors may offer a rational therapeutic avenue into melanoma, a highly chemotherapy-resistant neoplasm. Together, these data suggest that MITF represents a distinct class of 'lineage survival' or 'lineage addiction' oncogenes required for both tissue-specific cancer development and tumour progression.","Dana Farber Canc Inst, Dept Med Oncol, Pediat Oncol Biostat Sci & Melonam Program Med On, Boston, MA 02115 USA; Brigham & Womens Hosp, Dept Pathol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Brigham & Womens Hosp, Dept Med, Boston, MA 02115 USA; Harvard Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Biostat, Boston, MA 02115 USA; Broad Inst Harvard, Cambridge, MA 02141 USA; MIT, Cambridge, MA 02141 USA; Yale Univ, Sch Med, Dept Pathol, New Haven, CT 06510 USA; Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Ctr Canc Res, Charlestown, MA 02129 USA; Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Dept Med, Charlestown, MA 02129 USA; Austrian Acad Sci, Ctr Mol Med, A-1090 Vienna, Austria; Med Univ Vienna, Dept Dermatol, DIAID, A-1090 Vienna, Austria","Sellers, WR (reprint author), Dana Farber Canc Inst, Dept Med Oncol, Pediat Oncol Biostat Sci & Melonam Program Med On, 44 Binney St, Boston, MA 02115 USA.",William_Sellers@dfci.harvard.edu,"Meyerson, Matthew/E-7123-2012","Milner, Jr, Danny Arnold/0000-0002-6685-8208; Rubin, Mark/0000-0002-8321-9950; Wagner, Stephan/0000-0003-4941-7029",NCI NIH HHS [T32 CA009172],,,29,813,829,1,55,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,7-Jul,2005,436,7047,,,,,117,122,,10.1038/nature03664,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,942QJ,WOS:000230296600050,16001072,No,,,11/20/17

Here we explain the molecular pathways by which MMP-3 exerts these effects: exposure of mouse mammary epithelial cells to MMP-3 induces the expression of an alternatively spliced form of Rac1, which causes an increase in cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS). The ROS stimulate the expression of the transcription factor Snail and EMT, and cause oxidative damage to DNA and genomic instability. These findings identify a previously undescribed pathway in which a component of the breast tumour microenvironment alters cellular structure in culture and tissue structure in vivo, leading to malignant transformation.","Univ Calif Berkeley, Lawrence Berkeley Lab, Div Life Sci, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Anat, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; Dharmacon Inc, Lafayette, CO 80026 USA; Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Lab Med, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; Univ Calif San Francisco, Ctr Comprehens Canc, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; Inst Neurosci Alicante, Dept Dev Neurobiol, Alacant 03550, Spain","Bissell, MJ (reprint author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Lawrence Berkeley Lab, Div Life Sci, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",dcradisky@lbl.gov; mjbissell@lbl.gov,"Nieto, M.

Here we explore the role of some of these kinases in caveolae dynamics. We discover that caveolae operate using principles different from classical membrane trafficking. First, each caveolar coat contains a set number (one 'quantum') of caveolin-1 molecules. Second, caveolae are either stored as in stationary multi-caveolar structures at the plasma membrane, or undergo continuous cycles of fission and fusion with the plasma membrane in a small volume beneath the surface, without disassembling the caveolar coat. Third, a switch mechanism shifts caveolae from this localized cycle to long-range cytoplasmic transport. We have identified six kinases that regulate different steps of the caveolar cycle. Our observations reveal new principles in caveolae trafficking and suggest that the dynamic properties of caveolae and their transport competence are regulated by different kinases operating at several levels.","Max Planck Inst Mol Cell Biol & Genet, D-01307 Dresden, Germany","Pelkmans, L (reprint author), Max Planck Inst Mol Cell Biol & Genet, Pfotenhauerstr 108, D-01307 Dresden, Germany.",pelkmans@mpi-cbg.de,,,,,,22,217,221,1,15,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,7-Jul,2005,436,7047,,,,,128,133,,10.1038/nature03866,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,942QJ,WOS:000230296600052,16001074,No,,,11/20/17

The functioning of the antenna responds to the extreme changes in the intensity of sunlight encountered in nature(1-3). In shade, light is efficiently harvested in photosynthesis. However, in full sunlight, much of the energy absorbed is not needed and there are vitally important switches to specific antenna states, which safely dissipate the excess energy as heat(2,3). This is essential for plant survival(4), because it provides protection against the potential photo-damage of the photosynthetic membrane(5). But whereas the features that establish high photosynthetic efficiency have been highlighted(6), almost nothing is known about the molecular nature of the dissipative states. Recently, the atomic structure of the major plant light-harvesting antenna protein, LHCII, has been determined by X-ray crystallography(7). Here we demonstrate that this is the structure of a dissipative state of LHCII. We present a spectroscopic analysis of this crystal form, and identify the specific changes in configuration of its pigment population that give LHCII the intrinsic capability to regulate energy flow.

This higher-order structure of nucleosomes is the substrate for DNA replication, recombination, transcription and repair. Although the structure of the nucleosome core is known at near-atomic resolution(1), even the most fundamental information about the organization of nucleosomes in the fibre is controversial. Here we report the crystal structure of an oligonucleosome (a compact tetranucleosome) at 9 angstrom resolution, solved by molecular replacement using the nucleosome core structure. The structure shows that linker DNA zigzags back and forth between two stacks of nucleosome cores, which forma truncated two-start helix, and does not follow a path compatible with a one-start solenoidal helix(2). The length of linker DNA is most probably buffered by stretching of the DNA contained in the nucleosome cores. We have built continuous fibre models by successively stacking tetranucleosomes one on another.

We also determine the total duration of associated metamorphic events to be similar to 20 kyr, and of individual heat pulses experienced by the rocks to be as short as 10 years. Such short timescales are indicative of rapid tectonic processes associated with catastrophic deformation events ( earthquakes). Such events triggered transient heat advection by hot fluid along deformation ( shear) zones, which cut relatively cool and dry subducted crust.

Although this is characteristic of supernovae and neutron star mergers, uncertainties in where the r-process occurs persist because stellar models are too crude to allow precise quantification of this phenomenon. As a result, there are many uncertainties and assumptions in the models used to calculate the production ratios of actinides ( like uranium-238 and thorium-232). Current estimates of the U/Th production ratio range from similar to 0.4 to 0.7. Here I show that the U/Th abundance ratio in meteorites(9) can be used, in conjunction with observations of low-metallicity stars in the halo of the Milky Way(10-12), to determine the U/Th production ratio very precisely (0.571(-0.031)(+0.037)). This value can be used in future studies to constrain the possible nuclear mass formulae used in r- process calculations(5,6), to help determine the source of Galactic cosmic rays, and to date circumstellar grains(5).

A remarkable macroscopic consequence is the existence of a pressure-induced broken symmetry phase transition(2-4), in which the molecules go from a spherical rotational state to an anisotropic rotational state. Theoretical understanding of the broken symmetry phase structure remains controversial, despite numerous studies(5-10). Some open questions concern the existence of long- or short-range orientational order; whether a strong isotopic shift on the transition pressure should be assigned to the nuclear zero-point motion or to quantum localization; and whether the structures are cubic, hexagonal or orthorhombic. Here we present experimental data on the structure of the broken symmetry phase in solid D-2, obtained by a combination of neutron and X-ray diffraction up to 60 GPa. Our data are incompatible with orthorhombic structures predicted by recent theoretical works.

A variety of techniques(1-7) in X-ray imaging are currently being developed that may provide these combined capabilities. Here we report the achievement of sub-15-nm spatial resolution with a soft X-ray microscope - and a clear path to below 10 nm - using an overlay technique for zone plate fabrication. The microscope covers a spectral range from a photon energy of 250 eV (similar to 5 nm wavelength) to 1.8 keV (similar to 0.7 nm), so that primary K and L atomic resonances of elements such as C, N, O, Al, Ti, Fe, Co and Ni can be probed. This X-ray microscopy technique is therefore suitable for a wide range of studies: biological imaging in the water window(8,9); studies of wet environmental samples(10,11); studies of magnetic nanostructures with both elemental and spin-orbit sensitivity(12-14); studies that require viewing through thin windows, coatings or substrates ( such as buried electronic devices in a silicon chip(15)); and three-dimensional imaging of cryogenically fixed biological cells(9,16).","Univ Calif Berkeley, Lawrence Berkeley Lab, Ctr Xray Opt, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Elect Engn & Comp Sci, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA","Chao, WL (reprint author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Lawrence Berkeley Lab, Ctr Xray Opt, 1 Cyclotron Rd,MS 2-400, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",wlchao@lbl.gov,"Liddle, James/A-4867-2013","Liddle, James/0000-0002-2508-7910",,,,31,546,568,11,122,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,30-Jun,2005,435,7046,,,,,1210,1213,,10.1038/nature03719,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,940JJ,WOS:000230140500038,15988520,No,,,11/20/17

They provide important information for diagnosis and therapy, but for some desired applications, a higher resolution is required than can be obtained using the currently available medical imaging techniques. Consider, for example, the use of magnetic tracers in magnetic resonance imaging: detection thresholds for in vitro(8) and in vivo(9) imaging are such that the background signal from the host tissue is a crucial limiting factor. A sensitive method for detecting the magnetic particles directly is to measure their magnetic fields using relaxometry(10); but this approach has the drawback that the inverse problem ( associated with transforming the data into a spatial image) is ill posed and therefore yields low spatial resolution. Here we present a method for obtaining a high-resolution image of such tracers that takes advantage of the nonlinear magnetization curve of small magnetic particles. Initial 'phantom' experiments are reported that demonstrate the feasibility of the imaging method. The resolution that we achieve is already well below 1 mm. We evaluate the prospects for further improvement, and show that the method has the potential to be developed into an imaging method characterized by both high spatial resolution as well as high sensitivity.","Philips Res Hamburg, D-22335 Hamburg, Germany","Gleich, B (reprint author), Philips Res Hamburg, Rontgenstr 24-26, D-22335 Hamburg, Germany.",bernhard.gleich@philips.com; juergen.weizenecker@philips.com,,,,,,17,682,690,10,107,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,30-Jun,2005,435,7046,,,,,1214,1217,,10.1038/nature03808,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,940JJ,WOS:000230140500039,15988521,No,,,11/20/17

The inactive Sahel and southern African dune systems, which developed in multiple arid phases since the last interglacial period(2), are used today by pastoral and agricultural systems(3,4) that could be disrupted if climate change alters twenty-first century dune dynamics. Empirical data and model simulations have established that the interplay between dune surface erodibility ( determined by vegetation cover and moisture availability) and atmospheric erosivity ( determined by wind energy) is critical for dunefield dynamics(5). This relationship between erodibility and erosivity is susceptible to climate-change impacts. Here we use simulations with three global climate models and a range of emission scenarios to assess the potential future activity of three Kalahari dunefields. We determine monthly values of dune activity by modifying and improving an established dune mobility index(6) so that it can account for global climate model data outputs. We find that, regardless of the emission scenario used, significantly enhanced dune activity is simulated in the southern dunefield by 2039, and in the eastern and northern dunefields by 2069. By 2099 all dunefields are highly dynamic, from northern South Africa to Angola and Zambia. Our results suggest that dunefields are likely to be reactivated ( the sand will become significantly exposed and move) as a consequence of twenty-first century climate warming.","Univ Oxford, Ctr Environm, Sch Geog & Environm, Oxford OX1 3QY, England; Univ Salford, Dept Earth & Life Sci, Manchester M5 4WT, Lancs, England","Thomas, DSG (reprint author), Univ Oxford, Ctr Environm, Sch Geog & Environm, S Parks Rd, Oxford OX1 3QY, England.",david.thomas@ouce.ox.ac.uk,,"Thomas, David/0000-0001-6867-5504",,,,28,147,156,2,43,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,30-Jun,2005,435,7046,,,,,1218,1221,,10.1038/nature03717,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,940JJ,WOS:000230140500040,15988522,No,,,11/20/17

The geometry of the partly dismantled Indian plate as it passes through the Himalayan process zone has hitherto eluded imaging. Here we report seismic images both of the decollement at the base of the Himalaya and of the Moho ( the boundary between crust and mantle) at the base of the Indian crust. A significant finding is that strong seismic anisotropy develops above the decollement in response to shear processes that are taken up as slip in great earthquakes at shallower depths. North of the Himalaya, the lower Indian crust is characterized by a high-velocity region consistent with the formation of eclogite, a high-density material whose presence affects the dynamics of the Tibetan plateau.","Univ Colorado, Cooperat Inst Res Environm Sci, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; Dept Mines & Geol, Kathmandu, Nepal; SUNY Binghamton, Binghamton, NY 13902 USA","Schulte-Pelkum, V (reprint author), Univ Colorado, Cooperat Inst Res Environm Sci, Boulder, CO 80309 USA.",vera.schulte-pelkum@colorado.edu,"Sheehan, Anne/B-3954-2014","Sheehan, Anne/0000-0002-9629-1687; Bilham, Roger/0000-0002-5547-4102; Monsalve, Gaspar/0000-0002-6029-3058; Schulte-Pelkum, Vera/0000-0002-6057-5637",,,,32,238,254,5,48,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,30-Jun,2005,435,7046,,,,,1222,1225,,10.1038/nature03678,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,940JJ,WOS:000230140500041,15988523,No,,,11/20/17

The recognition that even simple ecological systems can undergo chaotic behaviour has made chaos a topic of considerable interest among theoretical ecologists(1-4). However, there is still a lack of experimental evidence that chaotic behaviour occurs in the real world of coexisting populations in multi-species systems. Here we study the dynamics of a defined predator - prey system consisting of a bacterivorous ciliate and two bacterial prey species. The bacterial species preferred by the ciliate was the superior competitor. Experimental conditions were kept constant with continuous cultivation in a one-stage chemostat. We show that the dynamic behaviour of such a two-prey, one-predator system includes chaotic behaviour, as well as stable limit cycles and coexistence at equilibrium. Changes in the population dynamics were triggered by changes in the dilution rates of the chemostat. The observed dynamics were verified by estimating the corresponding Lyapunov exponents. Such a defined microbial food web offers a new possibility for the experimental study of deterministic chaos in real biological systems.","Univ Cologne, Inst Zool, Dept Gen Ecol & Limnol, D-50923 Cologne, Germany; Univ Osnabruck, Inst Environm Syst Res, Dept Math & Comp Sci, D-49069 Osnabruck, Germany; Max Planck Inst Limnol, D-24302 Plon, Germany; Balt Sea Res Inst, D-18119 Rostock, Germany","Arndt, H (reprint author), Univ Cologne, Inst Zool, Dept Gen Ecol & Limnol, D-50923 Cologne, Germany.",hartmut.arndt@uni-koeln.de,"Hilker, Frank/B-8624-2008; Becks, Lutz/I-8256-2012","Hilker, Frank/0000-0001-5470-8889; ",,,,30,112,117,5,58,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,30-Jun,2005,435,7046,,,,,1226,1229,,10.1038/nature03627,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,940JJ,WOS:000230140500042,15988524,No,,,11/20/17

Here we report an extreme case of such conflicts in the little fire ant Wasmannia auropunctata. We found that sterile workers are produced by normal sexual reproduction, whereas daughter queens are invariably clonally produced. Because males usually develop from unfertilized maternal eggs in ants and other haplodiploid species, they normally achieve direct fitness only through diploid female offspring. Hence, although the clonal production of queens increases the queen's relatedness to reproductive daughters, it potentially reduces male reproductive success to zero. In an apparent response to this conflict between sexes, genetic analyses reveal that males reproduce clonally, most likely by eliminating the maternal half of the genome in diploid eggs. As a result, all sons have nuclear genomes identical to those of their father.

We have addressed this question in the macaque monkey by combining quantitative architectonic analysis of the cortical areas within the ventrolateral frontal region with electrophysiological recording of neuron activity and electrical intracortical microstimulation. Here we show that, immediately in front of the ventral part of the agranular premotor cortical area 6, there is a distinct cortical area that is architectonically comparable to human area 44 and that this monkey area 44 is involved with the orofacial musculature. We suggest that area 44 might have evolved originally as an area exercising high-level control over orofacial actions, including those related to communicative acts, and that, in the human brain, area 44 eventually also came to control certain aspects of the speech act.","McGill Univ, Montreal Neurol Inst, Montreal, PQ H3A 2B4, Canada","Petrides, M (reprint author), McGill Univ, Montreal Neurol Inst, 3801 Univ St, Montreal, PQ H3A 2B4, Canada.",petrides@ego.psych.mcgill.ca,"Galantucci, Bruno/E-5770-2010",,,,,30,178,182,1,19,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,30-Jun,2005,435,7046,,,,,1235,1238,,10.1038/nature03628,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,940JJ,WOS:000230140500044,15988526,No,,,11/20/17

This protein, named C. intestinalis voltage-sensor-containing phosphatase (Ci-VSP), displays channel-like 'gating' currents and directly translates changes in membrane potential into the turnover of phosphoinositides. The activity of the phosphoinositide phosphatase in Ci-VSP is tuned within a physiological range of membrane potential. Immunocytochemical studies show that Ci-VSP is expressed in Ciona sperm tail membranes, indicating a possible role in spermfunction or morphology.

Here we show that ephrin-A/EphA receptor signalling plays a key role in controlling the size of the mouse cerebral cortex by regulating cortical progenitor cell apoptosis. In vivo gain of EphA receptor function, achieved through ectopic expression of ephrin-A5 in early cortical progenitors expressing EphA7, caused a transient wave of neural progenitor cell apoptosis, resulting in premature depletion of progenitors and a subsequent dramatic decrease in cortical size. In vitro treatment with soluble ephrin-A ligands similarly induced the rapid death of cultured dissociated cortical progenitors in a caspase-3-dependent manner, thereby confirming a direct effect of ephrin/Eph signalling on apoptotic cascades. Conversely, in vivo loss of EphA function, achieved through EphA7 gene disruption, caused a reduction in apoptosis occurring normally in forebrain neural progenitors, resulting in an increase in cortical size and, in extreme cases, exencephalic forebrain overgrowth. Together, these results identify ephrin/Eph signalling as a physiological trigger for apoptosis that can alter brain size and shape by regulating the number of neural progenitors.","Univ Brussels, IRIBHM, B-1070 Brussels, Belgium; Univ Colorado, Dept Mol Cellular & Dev Biol, Boulder, CO 80309 USA","Vanderhaeghen, P (reprint author), Univ Brussels, IRIBHM, Campus Erasme,808 Route Lennik, B-1070 Brussels, Belgium.",pvdhaegh@ulb.ac.be,,,,,,30,190,197,1,10,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,30-Jun,2005,435,7046,,,,,1244,1250,,10.1038/nature03651,,7,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,940JJ,WOS:000230140500046,15902206,No,,,11/20/17

This mode of regulation is often based on specialized vesicle trafficking, termed constitutive cycling, which consists of repeated internalization and recycling of proteins to and from the plasma membrane(1). No such mechanism of hormone action has been shown in plants although several proteins, including the PIN auxin efflux facilitators, exhibit constitutive cycling(2,3). Here we show that a major regulator of plant development, auxin, inhibits endocytosis. This effect is specific to biologically active auxins and requires activity of the Calossin-like protein BIG. By inhibiting the internalization step of PIN constitutive cycling, auxin increases levels of PINs at the plasma membrane. Concomitantly, auxin promotes its own efflux from cells by a vesicle-trafficking-dependent mechanism. Furthermore, asymmetric auxin translocation during gravitropism is correlated with decreased PIN internalization. Our data imply a previously undescribed mode of plant hormone action: by modulating PIN protein trafficking, auxin regulates PIN abundance and activity at the cell surface, providing a mechanism for the feedback regulation of auxin transport.","Univ Tubingen, Zentrum Mol Biol Pflanzen, D-72076 Tubingen, Germany; ASCR, Inst Expt Bot, Prague 16502 6, Czech Republic; RWTH Aachen Univ, Cellome Res Grp, D-52074 Aachen, Germany; Univ Southampton, Sch Biol Sci, Southampton SO16 7PX, Hants, England","Friml, J (reprint author), Univ Tubingen, Zentrum Mol Biol Pflanzen, D-72076 Tubingen, Germany.",jiri.friml@zmbp.uni-tuebingen.de,"Petrasek, Jan/C-8240-2009; Friml, Jiri/D-9511-2012; Kleine-Vehn, Jurgen/C-8984-2014; Zazimalova, Eva/G-7432-2014","Petrasek, Jan/0000-0002-6719-2735; Kleine-Vehn, Jurgen/0000-0002-4354-3756; ",,,,30,439,461,3,107,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,30-Jun,2005,435,7046,,,,,1251,1256,,10.1038/nature03633,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,940JJ,WOS:000230140500047,15988527,No,,,11/20/17

Cullins, together with the RING-finger protein Rbx1, form the catalytic core of the ligase, and recruit the substrate-recognition module(1-4). Cycles of covalent modification of cullins by the ubiquitin-like molecule Nedd8 (neddylation)(5) and removal of Nedd8 by the COP9 signalosome (deneddylation) positively regulate E3 ligase activity(6,7). Here we report the identification and analysis of a widely conserved protein that is required for cullin neddylation in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans and the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. C. elegans DCN-1 and S. cerevisiae Dcn1p ( defective in cullin neddylation) are characterized by a novel UBA-like ubiquitin-binding domain and a DUF298 domain of unknown function. Consistent with their requirements for neddylation, DCN-1 and Dcn1p directly bind Nedd8 and physically associate with cullins in both species. Moreover, overexpression of Dcn1p in yeast results in the accumulation of Nedd8-modified cullin Cdc53p. Both in vivo and in vitro experiments indicate that Dcn1p does not inhibit deneddylation of Cdc53p by the COP9 signalosome, but greatly increases the kinetics of the neddylation reaction.","Univ Oregon, Inst Mol Biol, Eugene, OR 97403 USA; ETH Honggerberg, Inst Biochem, CH-8093 Zurich, Switzerland; Max Planck Inst Mol Cell Biol & Genet, D-01307 Dresden, Germany; Memorec Biotec GmbH, D-50829 Cologne, Germany","Peter, M (reprint author), Univ Oregon, Inst Mol Biol, Eugene, OR 97403 USA.",matthias.peter@bc.biol.ethz.ch,"Kurz, Thimo/E-4116-2012; Hyman, Anthony/B-3917-2017","Hyman, Anthony/0000-0003-3664-154X; Kurz, Thimo/0000-0003-0700-6993",,,,29,107,117,1,8,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,30-Jun,2005,435,7046,,,,,1257,1261,,10.1038/nature03662,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,940JJ,WOS:000230140500048,15988528,No,,,11/20/17

Other than being targeted to promoters, modifications of histones, such as acetylation and methylation of lysine and arginine residues, also occur over large regions of chromatin including coding regions and non-promoter sequences, which are referred to as global histone modifications(2). Here we show that changes in global levels of individual histone modifications are also associated with cancer and that these changes are predictive of clinical outcome. Through immunohistochemical staining of primary prostatectomy tissue samples, we determined the percentage of cells that stained for the histone acetylation and dimethylation of five residues in histones H3 and H4. Grouping of samples with similar patterns of modifications identified two disease subtypes with distinct risks of tumour recurrence in patients with low-grade prostate cancer. These histone modification patterns were predictors of outcome independently of tumour stage, preoperative prostate-specific antigen levels, and capsule invasion. Thus, widespread changes in specific histone modifications indicate previously undescribed molecular heterogeneity in prostate cancer and might underlie the broad range of clinical behaviour in cancer patients.","Univ Calif Los Angeles, David Geffen Sch Med, Dept Biol Chem, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; Univ Calif Los Angeles, David Geffen Sch Med, Dept Pathol & Lab Med, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; Univ Calif Los Angeles, David Geffen Sch Med, Dept Human Genet, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; Univ Calif Los Angeles, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Biostat, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA","Kurdistani, SK (reprint author), Univ Calif Los Angeles, David Geffen Sch Med, Dept Biol Chem, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.",skurdistani@mednet.ucla.edu,,"Kurdistani, Siavash/0000-0003-3295-3511",,,,24,611,639,1,44,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,30-Jun,2005,435,7046,,,,,1262,1266,,10.1038/nature03672,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,940JJ,WOS:000230140500049,15988529,No,,,11/20/17

Can imatinib eradicate leukaemic stem cells? What are the dynamics of relapse due to imatinib resistance, which is caused by mutations in the ABL kinase domain? The precise understanding of how imatinib exerts its therapeutic effect in CML and the ability to measure disease burden by quantitative polymerase chain reaction provide an opportunity to develop a mathematical approach. We find that a four-compartment model, based on the known biology of haematopoietic differentiation(5), can explain the kinetics of the molecular response to imatinib in a 169-patient data set. Successful therapy leads to a biphasic exponential decline of leukaemic cells. The first slope of 0.05 per day represents the turnover rate of differentiated leukaemic cells, while the second slope of 0.008 per day represents the turnover rate of leukaemic progenitors. The model suggests that imatinib is a potent inhibitor of the production of differentiated leukaemic cells, but does not deplete leukaemic stem cells. We calculate the probability of developing imatinib resistance mutations and estimate the time until detection of resistance. Our model provides the first quantitative insights into the in vivo kinetics of a human cancer.","Harvard Univ, Dept Math, Dept Organism & Evolutionary Biol, Program Evolutionary Dynam, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; Inst Med & Vet Sci, Adelaide, SA 5000, Australia; Kyushu Univ, Dept Biol, Fukuoka 8128581, Japan; Univ Calif Los Angeles, David Geffen Sch Med, Dept Med, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; Univ Calif Los Angeles, David Geffen Sch Med, Jonsson Comprehens Canc Ctr, Dept Med & Mol Pharmacol,Dept Urol,Mol Biol Inst, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA","Michor, F (reprint author), Harvard Univ, Dept Math, Dept Organism & Evolutionary Biol, Program Evolutionary Dynam, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",michor@fas.harvard.edu,"Nowak, Martin/A-6977-2008; Iwasa, Yoh/G-5368-2010; U-ID, Kyushu/C-5291-2016; Sawyers, Charles/G-5327-2016","Iwasa, Yoh/0000-0003-0691-1852; ",,,,27,496,512,0,38,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,30-Jun,2005,435,7046,,,,,1267,1270,,10.1038/nature03669,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,940JJ,WOS:000230140500050,15988530,No,,,11/20/17

This motion differs from the random-walk trajectories(5) of cells in free solution. Individual Escherichia coli cells swim in clockwise, circular trajectories near planar glass surfaces(6,7). On a semi-solid agar substrate, cells differentiate into an elongated, hyperflagellated phenotype and migrate cooperatively over the surface(8), a phenomenon called swarming. We have developed a technique for observing isolated E. coli swarmer cells(9) moving on an agar substrate and confined in shallow, oxidized poly( dimethylsiloxane) ( PDMS) microchannels. Here we show that cells in these microchannels preferentially 'drive on the right', swimming preferentially along the right wall of the microchannel ( viewed from behind the moving cell, with the agar on the bottom). We propose that when cells are confined between two interfaces - one an agar gel and the second PDMS they swim closer to the agar surface than to the PDMS surface ( and for much longer periods of time), leading to the preferential movement on the right of the microchannel.

In plants(3-5), fission yeast(6-8), ciliates(9,10), flies(11) and mammalian cells(12,13), short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) also induce DNA or chromatin modifications at the homologous genomic locus, which can result in transcriptional silencing or sequence elimination(14). siRNAs may direct DNA or chromatin modification by siRNA - DNA interactions at the homologous locus(4,5). Alternatively, they may act by interactions between siRNA and nascent transcript(15,16). Here we show that in fission yeast ( Schizosaccharomyces pombe), chromatin modifications are only directed by RNAi if the homologous DNA sequences are transcribed. Furthermore, transcription by exogenous T7 polymerase is not sufficient. Ago1, a component of the RNAi effector RISC/RITS complex, associates with target transcripts and RNA polymerase II. Truncation of the regulatory carboxy-terminal domain (CTD) of RNApol II disrupts transcriptional silencing, indicating that, like other RNA processing events(17-19), RNAi-directed chromatin modification is coupled to transcription.","Univ Edinburgh, Inst Cell & Mol Biol, Wellcome Trust Ctr Cell Biol, Edinburgh EH9 3JR, Midlothian, Scotland; Cold Spring Harbor Lab, Watson Sch Biol Sci, Cold Spring Harbor, NY 11724 USA; Univ Coll Sodertorn, Karolinska Inst, Dept Biosci, Dept Nat Sci, S-14189 Huddinge, Sweden","Allshire, RC (reprint author), Univ Edinburgh, Inst Cell & Mol Biol, Wellcome Trust Ctr Cell Biol, Kings Bldg, Edinburgh EH9 3JR, Midlothian, Scotland.",robin.allshire@ed.ac.uk,,,Wellcome Trust,,,30,54,64,0,14,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,30-Jun,2005,435,7046,,,,,1275,1279,,10.1038/nature03652,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,940JJ,WOS:000230140500052,15965464,No,,,11/20/17

Although these and other studies were consistent with predictions assuming superfluidity, proof of superfluid behaviour has been elusive. Here we report observations of vortex lattices in a strongly interacting, rotating Fermi gas that provide definitive evidence for superfluidity. The interaction and therefore the pairing strength between two Li-6 fermions near a Feshbach resonance can be controlled by an external magnetic field.

These ion channels rapidly deactivate and desensitize, which determine the time course of synaptic transmission.

The cytoplasmic tail of stargazin determines receptor trafficking, whereas the ectodomain controls channel properties. Stargazin alters AMPA receptor kinetics by increasing the rate of channel opening. Disrupting the interaction of stargazin ectodomain with hippocampal AMPA receptors alters the amplitude and shape of synaptic responses, establishing a crucial function for stargazin in controlling the efficacy of synaptic transmission in the brain.","Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Physiol, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Mol & Cellular Pharmacol, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; Yale Univ, Sch Med, Dept Pharmacol, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; Natl Ctr Neurol & Psychiat, Natl Inst Neurosci, Dept Degenerat Neurol Dis, Tokyo 1878502, Japan","Bredt, DS (reprint author), Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Physiol, Box 0444, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA.",nicoll@cmp.ucsf.edu; bredt@itsa.ucsf.edu,,,,,,43,281,292,1,18,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,23-Jun,2005,435,7045,,,,,1052,1058,,10.1038/nature03624,,7,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,937ZT,WOS:000229970400039,15858532,No,,,11/20/17

Meteorites that have experienced shock waves from such collisions can potentially be used to reveal the accretion process at different stages of evolution within the Solar System. Here we have determined the peak pressure experienced and the duration of impact in a chondrite and a martian meteorite, and have combined the data with impact scaling laws to infer the sizes of the impactors and the associated craters on the meteorite parent bodies. The duration of shock events is inferred from trace element distributions between coexisting high-pressure minerals in the shear melt veins of the meteorites. The shock duration and the associated sizes of the impactor are found to be much greater in the chondrite (similar to 1 s and 5 km, respectively) than in the martian meteorite (similar to 10 ms and 100 m). The latter result compares well with numerical modelling studies of cratering on Mars, and we suggest that martian meteorites with similar, recent ejection ages (10(5) to 10(7) years ago)(3) may have originated from the same few square kilometres on Mars.","Ecole Normale Super Lyon, CNRS, UMR 5570, Lab Sci Terre, F-69364 Lyon, France; Univ Lyon 1, F-69364 Lyon, France; Max Planck Inst Chem, D-55128 Mainz, Germany","Beck, P (reprint author), Ecole Normale Super Lyon, CNRS, UMR 5570, Lab Sci Terre, 46 Allee Italie, F-69364 Lyon, France.",pbeck@ens-lyon.fr,"Beck, Pierre/F-3149-2011",,,,,30,74,77,2,24,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,23-Jun,2005,435,7045,,,,,1071,1074,,10.1038/nature03616,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,937ZT,WOS:000229970400042,15973403,No,,,11/20/17

Similarly, granular materials are rigid, but become unjammed and flow if sufficient shear stress is applied. The rigid and flowing phases are strikingly different, yet measurements reveal that the structures of glass and liquid are virtually indistinguishable(1,2). It is therefore natural to ask whether there is a structural signature of the jammed granular state that distinguishes it from its flowing counterpart. Here we find evidence for such a signature, by measuring the contact-force distribution between particles during shearing. Because the forces are sensitive to minute variations in particle position, the distribution of forces can serve as a microscope with which to observe correlations in the positions of nearest neighbours. We find a qualitative change in the force distribution at the onset of jamming. If, as has been proposed(3-9), the jamming and glass transitions are related, our observation of a structural signature associated with jamming hints at the existence of a similar structural difference at the glass transition presumably too subtle for conventional scattering techniques to uncover. Our measurements also provide a determination of a granular temperature that is the counterpart in granular systems to the glass-transition temperature in liquids.","Univ Chicago, James Franck Inst, Dept Phys, Chicago, IL 60637 USA","Corwin, EI (reprint author), Univ Chicago, James Franck Inst, Dept Phys, 5640 S Ellis Ave, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.",ecorwin@uchicago.edu,,,,,,29,175,179,2,60,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,23-Jun,2005,435,7045,,,,,1075,1078,,10.1038/nature03698,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,937ZT,WOS:000229970400043,15973404,No,,,11/20/17

Understanding such forces and their spatial correlations, specifically in response to forces at the system boundaries(1,2), represents a fundamental goal of granular mechanics. The problem is of relevance to civil engineering, geophysics and physics(3-5), being important for the understanding of jamming, shear-induced yielding and mechanical response. Here we report measurements of the normal and tangential grain-scale forces inside a two-dimensional system of photoelastic disks that are subject to pure shear and isotropic compression. Various statistical measures show the underlying differences between these two stress states. These differences appear in the distributions of normal forces (which are more rounded for compression than shear), although not in the distributions of tangential forces (which are exponential in both cases). Sheared systems show anisotropy in the distributions of both the contact network and the contact forces. Anisotropy also occurs in the spatial correlations of forces, which provide a quantitative replacement for the idea of force chains. Sheared systems have long-range correlations in the direction of force chains, whereas isotropically compressed systems have short-range correlations regardless of the direction.","Duke Univ, Dept Phys, Durham, NC 27708 USA; Duke Univ, Ctr Nonlinear & Complex Syst, Durham, NC 27708 USA","Behringer, RP (reprint author), Duke Univ, Dept Phys, Durham, NC 27708 USA.",bob@phy.duke.edu,"Majmudar, Trushant/A-3067-2012",,,,,24,509,526,16,197,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,23-Jun,2005,435,7045,,,,,1079,1082,,10.1038/nature03805,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,937ZT,WOS:000229970400044,15973358,No,,,11/20/17

The leading hypothesis to explain the extreme greenhouse conditions prevalent during this period is the dissociation of 1,400 to 2,800 gigatonnes of methane from ocean clathrates(5,6), resulting in a large negative carbon isotope excursion and severe carbonate dissolution in marine sediments. Possible triggering mechanisms for this event include crossing a threshold temperature as the Earth warmed gradually(7), comet impact(8), explosive volcanism(9,10) or ocean current reorganization and erosion at continental slopes(11), whereas orbital forcing has been excluded(12). Here we report a distinct carbonate-poor red clay layer in deep-sea cores from Walvis ridge(13), which we term the Elmo horizon. Using orbital tuning, we estimate deposition of the Elmo horizon at about 2 million years after the Palaeocene-Eocene thermal maximum. The Elmo horizon has similar geochemical and biotic characteristics as the Palaeocene-Eocene thermal maximum, but of smaller magnitude. It is coincident with carbon isotope depletion events in other ocean basins, suggesting that it represents a second global thermal maximum. We show that both events correspond to maxima in the similar to 405-kyr and similar to 100-kyr eccentricity cycles that post-date prolonged minima in the 2.25-Myr eccentricity cycle, implying that they are indeed astronomically paced.","Univ Utrecht, Fac Geosci, Dept Earth Sci, NL-3584 CD Utrecht, Netherlands; Univ Utrecht, Dept Palaeoecol, Palaeobot & Palynol Lab, NL-3584 CD Utrecht, Netherlands; Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Fac Earth & Life Sci, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands; Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Earth Sci, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA; Wesleyan Univ, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, Middletown, CT 06459 USA; Yale Univ, Dept Geol & Geophys, Ctr Study Global Change, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; Univ Bremen, DFG Res Ctr Ocean Margins, D-28359 Bremen, Germany; Univ Calif San Diego, Scripps Inst Oceanog, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; Univ G DAnnunzio, Dipartimento Sci Terra, Fac Sci, I-66013 Chieti, Italy","Lourens, LJ (reprint author), Univ Utrecht, Fac Geosci, Dept Earth Sci, Budapestlaan 4, NL-3584 CD Utrecht, Netherlands.",llourens@geo.uu.nl,"Zachos, James/A-7674-2008; Thomas, Ellen/E-5573-2011; Rohl, Ursula/G-5986-2011; Sluijs, Appy/B-3726-2009","Thomas, Ellen/0000-0002-7141-9904; Rohl, Ursula/0000-0001-9469-7053; Sluijs, Appy/0000-0003-2382-0215",,,,27,280,294,3,68,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,23-Jun,2005,435,7045,,,,,1083,1087,,10.1038/nature03814,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,937ZT,WOS:000229970400045,15944716,No,,,11/20/17

The origin and modern significance of these earthquakes, however, is highly contentious(3). Geological evidence demonstrates that liquefaction due to strong ground shaking, similar in scale to that generated by the New Madrid earthquakes, has occurred at least three and possibly four times in the past 2,000 years (refs 4-6), consistent with recurrence statistics derived from regional seismicity(7). Here we show direct evidence for rapid strain rates in the area determined from a continuously operated global positioning system (GPS) network. Rates of strain are of the order of 10(-7) per year, comparable in magnitude to those across active plate boundaries, and are consistent with known active faults within the region.

Although classified within Eutheria, these mammals are phylogenetically remote from modern Insectivora(4) and have evolved specialized teeth as salivary venom delivery systems (VDSs) that differ markedly from one another and from those of Solenodon and shrews. Our discoveries therefore show that mammals have been much more flexible in the evolution of VDSs than previously believed, contradicting currently held notions that modern insectivorans are representative of the supposedly limited role of salivary venoms in mammalian history.

The kinematic symmetry of the hummingbird upstroke and downstroke(1-3) has led to the assumption that these halves of the wingbeat cycle contribute equally to weight support during hovering, as exhibited by insects of similar size(4). This assumption has been applied, either explicitly or implicitly, in widely used aerodynamic models(1,5-7) and in a variety of empirical tests(8,9). Here we provide measurements of the wake of hovering rufous hummingbirds (Selasphorus rufus) obtained with digital particle image velocimetry that show force asymmetry: hummingbirds produce 75% of their weight support during the downstroke and only 25% during the upstroke. Some of this asymmetry is probably due to inversion of their cambered wings during upstroke. The wake of hummingbird wings also reveals evidence of leading-edge vortices created during the downstroke, indicating that they may operate at Reynolds numbers sufficiently low to exploit a key mechanism typical of insect hovering(10,11). Hummingbird hovering approaches that of insects, yet remains distinct because of effects resulting from an inherently dissimilar-avian-body plan.","Oregon State Univ, Dept Zool, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA; Univ Portland, Dept Biol, Portland, OR 97203 USA; George Fox Univ, Dept Biol, Newberg, OR 97132 USA","Warrick, DR (reprint author), Oregon State Univ, Dept Zool, 3029 Cordley Hall, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA.",warrickd@science.oregonstate.edu,,"Powers, Donald/0000-0003-1126-7141",,,,24,166,167,2,56,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,23-Jun,2005,435,7045,,,,,1094,1097,,10.1038/nature03647,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,937ZT,WOS:000229970400048,15973407,No,,,11/20/17

These results suggest an invariant, sparse and explicit code, which might be important in the transformation of complex visual percepts into long-term and more abstract memories.","CALTECH, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA; Univ Calif Los Angeles, Div Neurosurg, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; Univ Calif Los Angeles, Inst Neuropsychiat, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; MIT, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; Tel Aviv Univ, Tel Aviv Med Ctr, Funct Neurosurg Unit, IL-69978 Tel Aviv, Israel; Tel Aviv Univ, Sackler Fac Med, IL-69978 Tel Aviv, Israel","Quiroga, RQ (reprint author), Univ Leicester, Dept Engn, Leicester LE1 7RH, Leics, England.",rodri@vis.caltech.edu,"Reddy, Leila/C-2181-2009","Koch, Christof/0000-0001-6482-8067",,,,30,645,653,8,134,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,23-Jun,2005,435,7045,,,,,1102,1107,,10.1038/nature03687,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,937ZT,WOS:000229970400050,15973409,No,,,11/20/17

Here we show that an opioid-independent form of this phenomenon, termed stress-induced analgesia(1), is mediated by the release of endogenous marijuana-like (cannabinoid) compounds in the brain. Blockade of cannabinoid CB1 receptors in the periaqueductal grey matter of the midbrain prevents non-opioid stress-induced analgesia. In this region, stress elicits the rapid formation of two endogenous cannabinoids, the lipids 2-arachidonoylglycerol(2) (2-AG) and anandamide(3). A newly developed inhibitor of the 2-AG-deactivating enzyme, monoacylglycerol lipase(4,5), selectively increases 2-AG concentrations and, when injected into the periaqueductal grey matter, enhances stress-induced analgesia in a CB1-dependent manner. Inhibitors of the anandamide-deactivating enzyme fatty-acid amide hydrolase(6), which selectively elevate anandamide concentrations, exert similar effects. Our results indicate that the coordinated release of 2-AG and anandamide in the periaqueductal grey matter might mediate opioid-independent stress-induced analgesia. These studies also identify monoacylglycerol lipase as a previously unrecognized therapeutic target.","Univ Georgia, Dept Psychol, Neurosci & Behav Program, Athens, GA 30602 USA; Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Pharmacol, Irvine, CA 92697 USA; Univ Calif Irvine, Ctr Drug Discovery, Irvine, CA 92697 USA; Brown Univ, Dept Psychol, Schrier Res Lab, Providence, RI 02912 USA; Brown Univ, Dept Neurosci, Schrier Res Lab, Providence, RI 02912 USA; Univ Urbino Carlo Bo, Inst Med Chem, I-61029 Urbino, Italy; Univ Parma, Dept Pharmaceut, I-43100 Parma, Italy","Hohmann, AG (reprint author), Univ Georgia, Dept Psychol, Neurosci & Behav Program, Athens, GA 30602 USA.",ahohmann@uga.edu; piomelli@uci.edu,"Mor, Marco/D-2394-2009","Mor, Marco/0000-0003-0199-1849",,,,30,441,463,1,34,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,23-Jun,2005,435,7045,,,,,1108,1112,,10.1038/nature03658,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,937ZT,WOS:000229970400051,15973410,No,,,11/20/17

We show that such limbs are arrested early in their developmental patterning and display severe truncations of distal elements, partly owing to the absence of Sonic hedgehog expression. These results indicate that the evolutionary recruitment of Hox gene function into growing appendages might have been crucial in implementing hedgehog signalling, subsequently leading to the distal extension of tetrapod appendages. Accordingly, these mutant limbs may be reminiscent of an ancestral trunk extension, related to that proposed for arthropods(6).","Univ Geneva, Dept Zool & Anim Biol, CH-1211 Geneva, Switzerland; Univ Geneva, Natl Res Ctr Frontiers Genet, CH-1211 Geneva, Switzerland; Natl Inst Med Res, Div Dev Biol, London NW7 1AA, England; Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Genet, Boston, MA 02115 USA","Duboule, D (reprint author), Univ Geneva, Dept Zool & Anim Biol, Sci 3,Quai Ernest Ansermet 30, CH-1211 Geneva, Switzerland.",denis.duboule@zoo.unige.ch,,"Kmita, Marie/0000-0003-4021-0478",Medical Research Council [MC_U117560477]; NICHD NIH HHS [R37 HD032443],,,29,151,154,0,23,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,23-Jun,2005,435,7045,,,,,1113,1116,,10.1038/nature03648,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,937ZT,WOS:000229970400052,15973411,No,,,11/20/17

Mechanisms of protection are not established for the heterozygous (haemoglobin AC) or homozygous (haemoglobin CC) states. Here we report a marked effect of haemoglobin C on the cell-surface properties of P. falciparum-infected erythrocytes involved in pathogenesis. Relative to parasite-infected normal erythrocytes (haemoglobin AA), parasitized AC and CC erythrocytes show reduced adhesion to endothelial monolayers expressing CD36 and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1). They also show impaired rosetting interactions with non-parasitized erythrocytes, and reduced agglutination in the presence of pooled sera from malaria-immune adults. Abnormal cell-surface display of the main variable cytoadherence ligand, PfEMP-1 (P. falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein-1), correlates with these findings. The abnormalities in PfEMP-1 display are associated with markers of erythrocyte senescence, and are greater in CC than in AC erythrocytes. Haemoglobin C might protect against malaria by reducing PfEMP-1-mediated adherence of parasitized erythrocytes, thereby mitigating the effects of their sequestration in the microvasculature.","NIAID, Lab Malaria & Vestor Res, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; NIAID, Malaria Vaccine Dev Branch, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; NIAID, Biol Imaging Facil, Res Technol Branch, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; Univ Calgary, Dept Microbiol & Infect Dis, Calgary, AB T2N 4N1, Canada; Univ Bamako, Fac Med Pharm & Odontostomatol, Dept Parasitol, Malaria Res & Training Ctr, Bamako, Mali; Univ Bamako, Fac Med Pharm & Odontostomatol, Dept Hematol, Malaria Res & Training Ctr, Bamako, Mali; Minist Hlth, Ctr Natl Transfus Sanguine, Bamako, Mali; Case Western Reserve Univ, Inst Pathol, Cleveland, OH 44106 USA","Wellems, TE (reprint author), NIAID, Lab Malaria & Vestor Res, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA.",twellems@niaid.nih.gov,,,,,,30,126,130,0,7,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,23-Jun,2005,435,7045,,,,,1117,1121,,10.1038/nature03631,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,937ZT,WOS:000229970400053,15973412,No,,,11/20/17

Here, we report the cloning of the R gene Xa27 from rice and the cognate avr gene avrXa27 from Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae. Resistant and susceptible alleles of Xa27 encode identical proteins. However, expression of only the resistant allele occurs when a rice plant is challenged by bacteria harbouring avrXa27, whose product is a nuclear localized type-III effector. Induction of Xa27 occurs only in the immediate vicinity of infected tissue, whereas ectopic expression of Xa27 resulted in resistance to otherwise compatible strains of the pathogen. Thus Xa27 specificity towards incompatible pathogens involves the differential expression of the R gene in the presence of the AvrXa27 effector.","Natl Univ Singapore, Temasek Life Sci Lab, Singapore 117604, Singapore; Kansas State Univ, Dept Plant Pathol, Manhattan, KS 66506 USA; Natl Univ Singapore, Inst Mol Agrobiol, Singapore 117604, Singapore","Yin, ZC (reprint author), Natl Univ Singapore, Temasek Life Sci Lab, 1 Res Link, Singapore 117604, Singapore.",yinzc@tll.org.sg,,"Chellamma, Sreekala/0000-0002-4615-6719",,,,29,293,377,6,90,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,23-Jun,2005,435,7045,,,,,1122,1125,,10.1038/nature03630,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,937ZT,WOS:000229970400054,15973413,No,,,11/20/17

Loss of EphB expression strongly correlates with degree of malignancy. Furthermore, reduction of EphB activity accelerates tumorigenesis in the colon and rectum of Apc(Min/+) mice, and results in the formation of aggressive adenocarcinomas.

Here we show that an engineered human LINE-1 (for long interspersed nuclear element-1; also known as L1) element can retrotranspose in neuronal precursors derived from rat hippocampus neural stem cells. The resulting retrotransposition events can alter the expression of neuronal genes, which, in turn, can influence neuronal cell fate in vitro. We further show that retrotransposition of a human L1 in transgenic mice results in neuronal somatic mosaicism. The molecular mechanism of action is probably mediated through Sox2, because a decrease in Sox2 expression during the early stages of neuronal differentiation is correlated with increases in both L1 transcription and retrotransposition. Our data therefore indicate that neuronal genomes might not be static, but some might be mosaic because of de novo L1 retrotransposition events.","Salk Inst Biol Studies, Genet Lab, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; Univ Michigan, Sch Med, Dept Human Genet & Internal Med, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA","Gage, FH (reprint author), Salk Inst Biol Studies, Genet Lab, 10010 N Torrey Pines Rd, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA.",gage@salk.edu,,,,,,44,416,432,3,17,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,16-Jun,2005,435,7044,,,,,903,910,,10.1038/nature03663,,8,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,935RN,WOS:000229799700037,15959507,No,,,11/20/17

Here we present two structures corresponding to the start and end points in the microtubule polymerization and hydrolysis cycles that illustrate the consequences of nucleotide state on longitudinal and lateral assembly. In the absence of depolymerizers, GDP-bound tubulin shows distinctive intra-dimer and inter-dimer interactions and thus distinguishes the GTP and GDP interfaces. A cold-stable tubulin polymer with the non-hydrolysable GTP analogue GMPCPP, containing semi-conserved lateral interactions, supports a model in which the straightening of longitudinal interfaces happens sequentially, starting with a conformational change after GTP binding that straightens the dimer enough for the formation of lateral contacts into a non-tubular intermediate.

Such high-frequency waves are difficult to detect because of high-frequency disturbances in Earth's atmosphere (seeing) and other factors. Here we report the detection of high-frequency waves, and we use numerical simulations to show that the acoustic energy flux of these waves is too low, by a factor of at least ten, to balance the radiative losses in the solar chromosphere.

Whether the major shell closures and magic numbers change in very neutron-rich nuclei (potentially causing shape deformations) is a fundamental, and at present open, question(3,4). A unique opportunity to study these shell effects is offered by the Si-42 nucleus, which has 28 neutrons-a magic number in stable nuclei-and 14 protons.

Relaxation of confined electron spin has been previously measured only for Zeeman or exchange split spin states, where spin-orbit effects dominate relaxation(8-10); spin flips due to nuclei have been observed in optical spectroscopy studies(11). Using an isolated GaAs double quantum dot defined by electrostatic gates and direct time domain measurements, we investigate in detail spin relaxation for arbitrary splitting of spin states. Here we show that electron spin flips are dominated by nuclear interactions and are slowed by several orders of magnitude when a magnetic field of a few millitesla is applied.

Such forces are traditionally calculated using continuum contact mechanics(1), which is known to break down as the contact radius approaches atomic dimensions. Yet contact mechanics is being applied at ever smaller lengths, driven by interest in shrinking devices to nano-metre scales(2,3), creating nanostructured materials with optimized mechanical properties(3,4), and understanding the molecular origins of macroscopic friction and adhesion(5,6). Here we use molecular simulations to test the limits of contact mechanics under ideal conditions. Our findings indicate that atomic discreteness within the bulk of the solids does not have a significant effect, but that the atomic-scale surface roughness that is always produced by discrete atoms leads to dramatic deviations from continuum theory. Contact areas and stresses may be changed by a factor of two, whereas friction and lateral contact stiffness change by an order of magnitude. These variations are likely to affect continuum predictions for many macroscopic rough surfaces, where studies(7,8) show that the total contact area is broken up into many separate regions with very small mean radius.","Johns Hopkins Univ, Dept Phys & Astron, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA","Robbins, MO (reprint author), Johns Hopkins Univ, Dept Phys & Astron, 3400 N Charles St, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA.",mr@jhu.edu,,,,,,29,340,352,14,141,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,16-Jun,2005,435,7044,,,,,929,932,,10.1038/nature03700,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,935RN,WOS:000229799700043,15959512,No,,,11/20/17

The damage potential of such earthquakes depends on the extent and magnitude of fault slip. The first reliable moment magnitude estimate(1) of 9.0 was obtained several hours after the Sumatra-Andaman earthquake, but more recent, longer-period, normal-mode analyses have indicated that it had a moment magnitude of 9.3, about 2.5 times larger(2). Here we introduce a method for directly imaging earthquake rupture that uses the first-arriving compressional wave and is potentially able to produce detailed images within 30 min of rupture initiation. We used the Hi-Net seismic array in Japan as an antenna to map the progression of slip by monitoring the direction of high-frequency radiation. We find that the rupture spread over the entire 1,300-km-long aftershock zone by propagating northward at roughly 2.8 km s(-1) for approximately 8 minutes. Comparisons with the aftershock areas of other great earthquakes indicate that the Sumatra-Andaman earthquake did indeed have a moment magnitude of similar to 9.3.

Compressional seismic waves generated at the hypocentre of the Sumatra earthquake arrived after about 12 min at the broadband seismic stations of the German Regional Seismic Network (GRSN)(2,3), located approximately 9,000 km from the event.

However, the growth periods of ornithurines (the theropod group including all modern birds) are usually apomorphically shortened to less than a year(2,3), so annual growth marks are almost unknown in this group(4-6). Here we show that cortical growth marks are frequent in long bones of New Zealand's moa (Aves: Dinornithiformes), a recently extinct ratite order. Moa showed the exaggerated K-selected life-history strategy formerly common in the New Zealand avifauna, and in some instances took almost a decade to attain skeletal maturity. This indicates that reproductive maturity in moa was extremely delayed relative to all extant birds. The two presently recognized moa families (Dinornithidae and Emeidae) also showed different postnatal growth rates, which were associated with their relative differences in body size. Both species of giant Dinornis moa attained their massive stature (up to 240 kg live mass) by accelerating their juvenile growth rate compared to the smaller emeid moa species, rather than by extending the skeletal growth period.","Univ Canterbury, Sch Biol Sci, Christchurch 8020, New Zealand; Zool Soc London, Inst Zool, London NW1 4RY, England; Univ Oxford, Dept Earth Sci, Oxford OX1 3PR, England; Palaecol Res Ltd, Christchurch 8004, New Zealand","Turvey, ST (reprint author), Univ Canterbury, Sch Biol Sci, Private Bag 4800, Christchurch 8020, New Zealand.",samuel.turvey@ioz.ac.uk,,,,,,30,50,52,0,14,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,16-Jun,2005,435,7044,,,,,940,943,,10.1038/nature03635,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,935RN,WOS:000229799700046,15959513,No,,,11/20/17

Here we show that Foxa1 and Foxa2 (forkhead box proteins A1 and A2) are required in concert for hepatic specification in mouse. In embryos deficient for both genes in the foregut endoderm, no liver bud is evident and expression of the hepato-blast marker alpha-fetoprotein (Afp) is lost. Furthermore, Foxa1/Foxa2-deficient endoderm cultured in the presence of exogenous fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) fails to initiate expression of the liver markers albumin and transthyretin.

Although the origin and molecular regulation of the earliest embryonic muscle cells is well understood(2), less is known about later stages of myogenesis. We have identified a new cell population that expresses the transcription factors Pax3 and Pax7 (paired box proteins 3 and 7) but no skeletal-muscle-specific markers. These cells are maintained as a proliferating population in embryonic and fetal muscles of the trunk and limbs throughout development. Using a stable green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporter targeted to Pax3, we demonstrate that they constitute resident muscle progenitor cells that subsequently become myogenic and form skeletal muscle. Late in fetal development, these cells adopt a satellite cell position characteristic of progenitor cells in postnatal muscle. In the absence of both Pax3 and Pax7, further muscle development is arrested and only the early embryonic muscle of the myotome forms. Cells failing to express Pax3 or Pax7 die or assume a non-myogenic fate. We conclude that this resident Pax3/Pax7-dependent progenitor cell population constitutes a source of myogenic cells of prime importance for skeletal muscle formation, a finding also of potential value in the context of cell therapy for muscle disease.","Inst Pasteur, CNRS, URA 2578, Dept Dev Biol, F-75724 Paris, France; Max Planck Inst Biophys Chem, Dept Mol Cell Biol, D-37077 Gottingen, Germany","Relaix, F (reprint author), Inst Pasteur, CNRS, URA 2578, Dept Dev Biol, F-75724 Paris, France.",frelaix@pasteur.fr; margab@pasteur.fr,"Mansouri, Abdelhak/D-9100-2013","Mansouri, Abdelhak/0000-0003-4471-7276",,,,25,556,576,5,39,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,16-Jun,2005,435,7044,,,,,948,953,,10.1038/nature03594,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,935RN,WOS:000229799700048,15843801,No,,,11/20/17

Furthermore, long-term lineage analyses indicate that satellite cells, which are known progenitors of adult skeletal muscles(4), derive from the same dermomyotome cell population.

This vasculature expresses the adhesion molecule E-selectin and the chemoattractant stromal-cell-derived factor 1 (SDF-1) in discrete, discontinuous areas that influence the homing of a variety of tumour cell lines. Disruption of the interactions between SDF-1 and its receptor CXCR4 inhibits the homing of Nalm-6 cells (an acute lymphoblastic leukaemia cell line) to these vessels. Further studies revealed that circulating leukaemic cells can engraft around these vessels, suggesting that this molecularly distinct vasculature demarcates a microenvironment for early metastatic tumour spread in bone marrow. Finally, purified haematopoietic stem/progenitor cells and lymphocytes also localize to the same microdomains, indicating that this vasculature might also function in benign states to demarcate specific portals for the entry of cells into the marrow space.

Analysis of GSCs mutant for dicer-1 (dcr-1), the double-stranded RNaseIII essential for miRNA biogenesis, revealed a marked reduction in the rate of germline cyst production. These dcr-1 mutant GSCs exhibit normal identity but are defective in cell cycle control. On the basis of cell cycle markers and genetic interactions, we conclude that dcr-1 mutant GSCs are delayed in the G1 to S transition, which is dependent on the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor Dacapo, suggesting that miRNAs are required for stem cells to bypass the normal G1/S checkpoint. Hence, the miRNA pathway might be part of a mechanism that makes stem cells insensitive to environmental signals that normally stop the cell cycle at the G1/S transition.","Univ Washington, Dept Biochem, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; Northwestern Univ, Dept Biochem Mol Biol & Cell Biol, Evanston, IL 60208 USA","Ruohola-Baker, H (reprint author), Univ Washington, Dept Biochem, J591,HSB, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.",r-carthew@northwestern.edu; hannele@u.washington.edu,"Nakahara, Kenji/F-5780-2012; Shcherbata, Halyna/J-5712-2017","Nakahara, Kenji/0000-0002-9541-3208; Shcherbata, Halyna/0000-0002-3855-0345",NIGMS NIH HHS [R01 GM077581],,,30,443,486,2,41,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,16-Jun,2005,435,7044,,,,,974,978,,10.1038/nature03816,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,935RN,WOS:000229799700053,15944714,No,,,11/20/17

However, little is known about the molecular mechanisms of SUMO-modification-induced protein functional transfer. During DNA mismatch repair, SUMO conjugation of the uracil/ thymine DNA glycosylase TDG promotes the release of TDG from the abasic (AP) site created after base excision, and coordinates its transfer to AP endonuclease 1, which catalyses the next step in the repair pathway(6). Here we report the crystal structure of the central region of human TDG conjugated to SUMO-1 at 2.1 angstrom resolution. The structure reveals a helix protruding from the protein surface, which presumably interferes with the product DNA and thus promotes the dissociation of TDG from the DNA molecule. This helix is formed by covalent and non-covalent contacts between TDG and SUMO-1. The non-covalent contacts are also essential for release from the product DNA, as verified by mutagenesis.","Yokohama City Univ, Grad Sch Integrated Sci, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2300045, Japan; Japan Biol Informat Consortium, Tokyo 1040032, Japan; RIKEN Genom Sci Ctr, Kanagawa 2300045, Japan; Kumamoto Univ, Inst Mol Embryol & Genet, Dept Regenerat Med, Kumamoto 8600811, Japan; RIKEN, Discovery Res Inst, Cellular Physiol Lab, Wako, Saitama 3510198, Japan; Japan Sci & Technol Univ, SORST, Kawaguchi, Saitama 3320012, Japan; Osaka Univ, Grad Sch Frontier Biosci, Suita, Osaka 5650871, Japan; Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Engn, Kyoto 6158510, Japan; Japan Sci & Technol Corp, CREST, Kawaguchi, Saitama 3320012, Japan","Shirakawa, M (reprint author), Yokohama City Univ, Grad Sch Integrated Sci, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2300045, Japan.",shirakawa@moleng.kyoto-u.ac.jp,"Tochio, Hidehito/F-6109-2011; Hiroaki, Hidekazu /G-9564-2012; Maita, Nobuo/J-1443-2012","Maita, Nobuo/0000-0003-2260-5783; Hiroaki, Hidekazu/0000-0003-1621-5893; Tochio, Hidehito/0000-0003-3843-3330",,,,25,152,159,1,17,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,16-Jun,2005,435,7044,,,,,979,982,,10.1038/nature03634,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,935RN,WOS:000229799700054,15959518,No,,,11/20/17

Hybrid natural products such as naphterpin that contain 5-carbon ( dimethylallyl), 10-carbon ( geranyl) or 15-carbon ( farnesyl) isoprenoid chains possess biological activities distinct from their non-prenylated aromatic precursors(4). These hybrid natural products represent new anti-microbial, anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-viral and anti-cancer compounds. A small number of aromatic prenyltransferases (PTases) responsible for prenyl group attachment have only recently been isolated and characterized(5,6). Here we report the gene identification, biochemical characterization and high-resolution X-ray crystal structures of an architecturally novel aromatic PTase, Orf2 from Streptomyces sp. strain CL190, with substrates and substrate analogues bound. In vivo, Orf2 attaches a geranyl group to a 1,3,6,8-tetrahydroxynaphthalene-derived polyketide during naphterpin biosynthesis. In vitro, Orf2 catalyses carbon-carbon-based and carbon-oxygen-based prenylation of a diverse collection of hydroxyl-containing aromatic acceptors of synthetic, microbial and plant origin. These crystal structures, coupled with in vitro assays, provide a basis for understanding and potentially manipulating the regio-specific prenylation of aromatic small molecules using this structurally unique family of aromatic PTases.","Salk Inst Biol Studies, Jack Skirball Chem Biol & Proteom Lab, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; Univ Tokyo, Biotechnol Res Ctr, Lab Cell Biotechnol, Tokyo 1138657, Japan","Richard, SB (reprint author), Salk Inst Biol Studies, Jack Skirball Chem Biol & Proteom Lab, 10010 N Torrey Pines Rd, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA.",richard@salk.edu,"FIP, BM30A/I-5166-2015","Kuzuyama, Tomohisa/0000-0002-7221-5858",Howard Hughes Medical Institute,,,29,160,165,6,54,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,16-Jun,2005,435,7044,,,,,983,987,,10.1038/nature03668,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,935RN,WOS:000229799700055,15959519,No,,,11/20/17

This means that finding optimal solutions for many practical problems is completely beyond any current or projected computational capacity. To understand the origin of this extreme 'hardness', computer scientists, mathematicians and physicists have been investigating for two decades a connection between computational complexity and phase transitions in random instances of constraint satisfaction problems. Here we present a mathematically rigorous method for locating such phase transitions. Our method works by analysing the distribution of distances between pairs of solutions as constraints are added. By identifying critical behaviour in the evolution of this distribution, we can pinpoint the threshold location for a number of problems, including the two most-studied ones: random k-SAT and random graph colouring. Our results prove that the heuristic predictions of statistical physics in this context are essentially correct. Moreover, we establish that random instances of constraint satisfaction problems have solutions well beyond the reach of any analysed algorithm.","Microsoft Res, Redmond, WA 98052 USA; Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Stat, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA","Achlioptas, D (reprint author), Microsoft Res, 1 Microsoft Way, Redmond, WA 98052 USA.",optas@microsoft.com,,,,,,25,105,109,1,20,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,9-Jun,2005,435,7043,,,,,759,764,,10.1038/nature03602,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,933NK,WOS:000229638700039,15944693,No,,,11/20/17

Despite intense research, the architecture and conformational conversion of amyloids remain poorly understood. Amyloid conformers of Sup35 are the molecular embodiment of the yeast prion known as [ PSI], which produces heritable changes in phenotype through self-perpetuating changes in protein folding. Here we determine the nature of Sup35' s cooperatively folded amyloid core, and use this information to investigate central questions in prion biology. Specific segments of the amyloid core form intermolecular contacts in a 'Head-to-Head', 'Tail-to-Tail' fashion, but the 'Central Core' is sequestered through intramolecular contacts. The Head acquires productive interactions first, and these nucleate assembly. Variations in the length of the amyloid core and the nature of intermolecular interfaces form the structural basis of distinct prion 'strains', which produce variant phenotypes in vivo. These findings resolve several problems in yeast prion biology and have broad implications for other amyloids.","Whitehead Inst Biomed Res, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA","Lindquist, SL (reprint author), Whitehead Inst Biomed Res, 9 Cambridge Ctr, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA.",Lindquist_admin@wi.mit.edu,,,"NIGMS NIH HHS [R37 GM025874, R01 GM025874]",,,51,343,348,5,27,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,9-Jun,2005,435,7043,,,,,765,772,,10.1038/nature03679,,8,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,933NK,WOS:000229638700040,15944694,No,,,11/20/17

For the yeast protein Sup35, conversion to amyloid-like fibrils is associated with a transmissible infection akin to that caused by mammalian prions. A seven-residue peptide segment from Sup35 forms amyloid-like fibrils and closely related microcrystals, from which we have determined the atomic structure of the cross-beta spine. It is a double beta-sheet, with each sheet formed from parallel segments stacked in register. Side chains protruding from the two sheets form a dry, tightly self-complementing steric zipper, bonding the sheets. Within each sheet, every segment is bound to its two neighbouring segments through stacks of both backbone and side-chain hydrogen bonds.

The structure reveals only minor differences in the motor domain from that in plus-end directed myosins, with the exception of two unique inserts. The first is near the nucleotide-binding pocket and alters the rates of nucleotide association and dissociation. The second unique insert forms an integral part of the myosin VI converter domain along with a calmodulin bound to a novel target motif within the insert. This serves to redirect the effective 'lever arm' of myosin VI, which includes a second calmodulin bound to an 'IQ motif', towards the pointed ( minus) end of the actin filament. This repositioning largely accounts for the reverse directionality of this class of myosin motors.

Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain this connection(2-7), and evidence from modelling(8) as well as various types of measurements(9-14) demonstrate that lightning can interact with the lower ionosphere. It has been proposed, on the basis of a few observed events(15), that the ionospheric 'sporadic E' layer - transient, localized patches of relatively high electron density in the mid-ionosphere E layer, which significantly affect radio-wave propagation - can be modulated by thunderstorms, but a more formal statistical analysis is still needed. Here we identify a statistically significant intensification and descent in altitude of the mid-latitude sporadic E layer directly above thunderstorms. Because no ionospheric response to low-pressure systems without lightning is detected, we conclude that this localized intensification of the sporadic E layer can be attributed to lightning. We suggest that the co-location of lightning and ionospheric enhancement can be explained by either vertically propagating gravity waves that transfer energy from the site of lightning into the ionosphere, or vertical electrical discharge, or by a combination of these two mechanisms.","Rutherford Appleton Lab, Chilton OX11 0QX, Oxon, England","Davis, CJ (reprint author), Rutherford Appleton Lab, Chilton OX11 0QX, Oxon, England.",C.J.Davis@rl.ac.uk,"Johnson, Chris/B-3163-2012; Scott, Christopher/H-8664-2012","Johnson, Chris/0000-0003-2192-3616; Scott, Christopher/0000-0001-6411-5649",,,,30,24,26,0,5,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,9-Jun,2005,435,7043,,,,,799,801,,10.1038/nature03638,,3,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,933NK,WOS:000229638700046,15944700,No,,,11/20/17

So far, this procedure has been limited to the past 800,000 years ( 800 kyr; ref. 3), which does not include any geomagnetic reversals. Here we present a composite curve that shows the evolution of the dipole moment during the past two million years. This reconstruction is in good agreement with the absolute dipole moments derived from volcanic lavas, which were used for calibration. We show that, at least during this period, the time-averaged field was higher during periods without reversals but the amplitude of the short-term oscillations remained the same. As a consequence, few intervals of very low intensity, and thus fewer instabilities, are expected during periods with a strong average dipole moment, whereas more excursions and reversals are expected during periods of weak field intensity. We also observe that the axial dipole begins to decay 60 - 80 kyr before reversals, but rebuilds itself in the opposite direction in only a few thousand years.","Inst Phys Globe, CNRS, UMR Geomagnetisme & Paleomagnetisme 7577, F-75252 Paris, France; Inst Phys Globe, CNRS, UMR Geochim & Cosmochim7579, F-75252 Paris, France; Lab Sci Climat & Environm, F-91190 Gif Sur Yvette, France","Valet, JP (reprint author), Inst Phys Globe, CNRS, UMR Geomagnetisme & Paleomagnetisme 7577, 4 Pl Jussieu, F-75252 Paris, France.",valet@ipgp.jussieu.fr,"Guyodo, Yohan/G-8282-2011; Meynadier, Laure/A-6349-2011; Valet, Jean-Pierre/A-6332-2011",,,,,31,201,210,2,47,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,9-Jun,2005,435,7043,,,,,802,805,,10.1038/nature03674,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,933NK,WOS:000229638700047,15944701,No,,,11/20/17

Island systems have considerable scope for studying how biotic and abiotic factors influence processes in different ecosystems, because they enable the simultaneous study of large numbers of independent replicate systems at ecologically meaningful spatial scales(5-7). We studied a group of 30 islands in northern Sweden, for which island size determined disturbance history, and therefore vegetation successional stage and biotic and abiotic ecosystem properties. On each island we conducted a seven-year study that involved experimental removals of combinations of both plant functional groups and plant species. We show that although losses of functional groups and species often impaired key ecosystem processes, these effects were highly context-dependent and strongly influenced by island size. Our study provides evidence that the consequences of biotic loss for ecosystem functioning vary greatly among ecosystems and depend on the specific abiotic and biotic attributes of the system.","Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Fac Forestry, Dept Forest Vegetat Ecol, S-90183 Umea, Sweden; Landcare Res, Lincoln 8152, New Zealand","Wardle, DA (reprint author), Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Fac Forestry, Dept Forest Vegetat Ecol, S-90183 Umea, Sweden.",david.wardle@svek.slu.se,"Wardle, David/F-6031-2011","Wardle, David/0000-0002-0476-7335",,,,27,139,154,5,89,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,9-Jun,2005,435,7043,,,,,806,810,,10.1038/nature03611,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,933NK,WOS:000229638700048,15944702,No,,,11/20/17

Conventional measures of age count years since birth; however, as lives lengthen, we need to think of age also in terms of years left until death or in proportion to the expanding lifespan. Here we propose a new measure of ageing: the median age of the population standardized for expected remaining years of life. We show, using historical data and forecasts for Germany, Japan and the United States, that although these populations will be growing older, as measured by their median ages, they will probably experience periods in which they grow younger, as measured by their standardized median ages. Furthermore, we provide forecasts for these countries of the old-age dependency ratio rescaled for increases in life expectancy at birth(5). These ratios are forecasted to change much less than their unscaled counterparts, and also exhibit periods when the population is effectively growing younger.","SUNY Stony Brook, Dept Econ & Hist, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA; Int Inst Appl Syst Anal, World Populat Project, A-2361 Laxenburg, Austria; Vienna Inst Demog, A-1040 Vienna, Austria","Sanderson, WC (reprint author), SUNY Stony Brook, Dept Econ & Hist, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA.",wsanderson@notes.cc.sunysb.edu,,,,,,19,54,57,3,20,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,9-Jun,2005,435,7043,,,,,811,813,,10.1038/nature03593,,3,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,933NK,WOS:000229638700049,15944703,No,,,11/20/17

A key question is how to interpret the global organization of such networks as the coexistence of their structural subunits ( communities) associated with more highly interconnected parts. Identifying these a priori unknown building blocks ( such as functionally related proteins(5,6), industrial sectors(7) and groups of people(8,9)) is crucial to the understanding of the structural and functional properties of networks. The existing deterministic methods used for large networks find separated communities, whereas most of the actual networks are made of highly overlapping cohesive groups of nodes. Here we introduce an approach to analysing the main statistical features of the interwoven sets of overlapping communities that makes a step towards uncovering the modular structure of complex systems. After defining a set of new characteristic quantities for the statistics of communities, we apply an efficient technique for exploring overlapping communities on a large scale. We find that overlaps are significant, and the distributions we introduce reveal universal features of networks. Our studies of collaboration, word-association and protein interaction graphs show that the web of communities has non-trivial correlations and specific scaling properties.","Hungarian Acad Sci, Biol Phys Res Grp, H-1117 Budapest, Hungary; Eotvos Lorand Univ, Dept Biol Phys, H-1117 Budapest, Hungary","Vicsek, T (reprint author), Hungarian Acad Sci, Biol Phys Res Grp, Pazmany Pstny 1A, H-1117 Budapest, Hungary.",vicsek@angel.elte.hu,"Farkas, Illes/C-1504-2008; Vicsek, Tamas/A-3305-2009; Derenyi, Imre /G-8087-2011; Palla, Gergely/H-1767-2016","Farkas, Illes/0000-0001-5341-5582; Derenyi, Imre /0000-0003-1171-1214; Palla, Gergely/0000-0002-3406-4200",,,,30,2053,2321,10,261,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,9-Jun,2005,435,7043,,,,,814,818,,10.1038/nature03607,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,933NK,WOS:000229638700050,15944704,No,,,11/20/17

This exchange is a significant factor in global nutrient cycles(1) as well as in the ecology(2), evolution(3) and physiology(4) of plants. Despite its importance as a nutrient, very little is known about how AMF take up nitrogen and transfer it to their host plants(5). Here we report the results of stable isotope labelling experiments showing that inorganic nitrogen taken up by the fungus outside the roots is incorporated into amino acids, translocated from the extraradical to the intraradical mycelium as arginine, but transferred to the plant without carbon. Consistent with this mechanism, the genes of primary nitrogen assimilation are preferentially expressed in the extraradical tissues, whereas genes associated with arginine breakdown are more highly expressed in the intraradical mycelium. Strong changes in the expression of these genes in response to nitrogen availability and form also support the operation of this novel metabolic pathway in the arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis.","New Mexico State Univ, Dept Chem & Biochem, Las Cruces, NM 88003 USA; ARS, USDA, Eastern Reg Res Ctr, Wyndmoor, PA 19038 USA; Michigan State Univ, Dept Plant Biol, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA","Lammers, PJ (reprint author), New Mexico State Univ, Dept Chem & Biochem, Las Cruces, NM 88003 USA.",ppfeffer@arserrc.gov; plammers@nmsu.edu,"Shachar-Hill, Yair/B-6165-2013","Shachar-Hill, Yair/0000-0001-8793-5084",,,,30,361,406,12,264,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,9-Jun,2005,435,7043,,,,,819,823,,10.1038/nature03610,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,933NK,WOS:000229638700051,15944705,No,,,11/20/17

The fungi are incapable of completing their life cycle in the absence of a host root. Their spores can germinate and grow in the absence of a host, but their hyphal growth is very limited. Little is known about the molecular mechanisms that govern signalling and recognition between AM fungi and their host plants. In one of the first stages of host recognition, the hyphae of AM fungi show extensive branching in the vicinity of host roots before formation of the appressorium(2-4), the structure used to penetrate the plant root. Host roots are known to release signalling molecules that trigger hyphal branching(5-7), but these branching factors have not been isolated. Here we have isolated a branching factor from the root exudates of Lotus japonicus and used spectroscopic analysis and chemical synthesis to identify it as a strigolactone, 5-deoxy-strigol. Strigolactones are a group of sesquiterpene lactones, previously isolated as seed-germination stimulants for the parasitic weeds Striga and Orobanche(8).

Here we compared B-cell lymphoma samples and cell lines to normal tissues, and found that the levels of the primary or mature microRNAs derived from the mir-17-92 locus are often substantially increased in these cancers. Enforced expression of the mir-17-92 cluster acted with c-myc expression to accelerate tumour development in a mouse B-cell lymphoma model. Tumours derived from haematopoietic stem cells expressing a subset of the mir- 17 - 92 cluster and c-myc could be distinguished by an absence of apoptosis that was otherwise prevalent in c-myc-induced lymphomas.

Although strict tissue- and developmental-stage-specific expression is critical for appropriate miRNA function, mammalian transcription factors that regulate miRNAs have not yet been identified. The proto-oncogene c-MYC encodes a transcription factor that regulates cell proliferation, growth and apoptosis(3). Dysregulated expression or function of c-Myc is one of the most common abnormalities in human malignancy(4). Here we show that c-Myc activates expression of a cluster of six miRNAs on human chromosome 13. Chromatin immunoprecipation experiments show that c-Myc binds directly to this locus. The transcription factor E2F1 is an additional target of c-Myc that promotes cell cycle progression(5-7). We find that expression of E2F1 is negatively regulated by two miRNAs in this cluster, miR-17-5p and miR-20a.

However, the structural basis of prion infectivity remains largely elusive because acquisition of atomic resolution structural properties of amyloid fibrils represents a largely unsolved technical challenge. HET-s, the prion protein of P. anserina, contains a carboxy-terminal prion domain comprising residues 218 - 289. Amyloid fibrils of HET-s( 218 - 289) are necessary and sufficient for the induction and propagation of prion infectivity(6). Here, we have used fluorescence studies, quenched hydrogen exchange NMR and solid-state NMR to determine the sequence-specific positions of amyloid fibril secondary structure elements of HET-s( 218 - 289). This approach revealed four beta-strands constituted by two pseudo-repeat sequences, each forming a beta-strand-turn-beta- strand motif.

These cytokine genes are encoded on different chromosomes. The recently described T(H)2 locus control region (LCR) coordinately regulates the T(H)2 cytokine genes by participating in a complex between the LCR and promoters of the cytokine genes Il4, Il5 and Il13. Although they are spread over 120 kilobases, these elements are closely juxtaposed in the nucleus in a poised chromatin conformation. In addition to these intrachromosomal interactions, we now describe interchromosomal interactions between the promoter region of the IFN-gamma gene on chromosome 10 and the regulatory regions of the T(H)2 cytokine locus on chromosome 11. DNase I hypersensitive sites that comprise the T(H)2 LCR developmentally regulate these interchromosomal interactions. Furthermore, there seems to be a cell-type-specific dynamic interaction between interacting chromatin partners whereby interchromosomal interactions are apparently lost in favour of intrachromosomal ones upon gene activation. Thus, we provide an example of eukaryotic genes located on separate chromosomes associating physically in the nucleus via interactions that may have a function in coordinating gene expression.","Yale Univ, Sch Med, Immunobiol Sect, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; Yale Univ, Sch Med, Dept Genet, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; Howard Hughes Med Inst, New Haven, CT 06520 USA","Flavell, RA (reprint author), Yale Univ, Sch Med, Immunobiol Sect, 333 Cedar St, New Haven, CT 06520 USA.",richard.flavell@yale.edu,"Spilianakis, Charalampos/C-9893-2011","Spilianakis, Charalampos/0000-0003-0921-1923",,,,37,461,477,2,38,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,2-Jun,2005,435,7042,,,,,637,645,,10.1038/nature03574,,9,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,931HK,WOS:000229476200042,15880101,No,,,11/20/17

Here we report a general solution using two fundamental biological processes: DNA recognition by C2H2 zinc-finger proteins and homology-directed repair of DNA double-strand breaks. Zinc-finger proteins engineered to recognize a unique chromosomal site can be fused to a nuclease domain, and a double-strand break induced by the resulting zinc-finger nuclease can create specific sequence alterations by stimulating homologous recombination between the chromosome and an extrachromosomal DNA donor. We show that zinc-finger nucleases designed against an X-linked severe combined immune deficiency ( SCID) mutation in the IL2R gamma gene yielded more than 18% gene-modified human cells without selection. Remarkably, about 7% of the cells acquired the desired genetic modification on both X chromosomes, with cell genotype accurately reflected at the messenger RNA and protein levels. We observe comparably high frequencies in human T cells, raising the possibility of strategies based on zinc-finger nucleases for the treatment of disease.","Sangamo BioSci Inc, Richmond, CA 94804 USA; Univ Texas, SW Med Ctr, Dept Pediat, Dallas, TX 75390 USA; Univ Texas, SW Med Ctr, Dept Biochem, Dallas, TX 75390 USA","Holmes, MC (reprint author), Sangamo BioSci Inc, Pt Richmond Tech Ctr 501,Canal Blvd,Suite A100, Richmond, CA 94804 USA.",matthew.porteus@UTSouthwestern.edu; mholmes@sangamo.com,,,,,,39,873,944,7,133,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,2-Jun,2005,435,7042,,,,,646,651,,10.1038/nature03556,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,931HK,WOS:000229476200043,15806097,No,,,11/20/17

Although this phenomenon has been seen in young stars, a fundamental question is whether it also occurs among newborn brown dwarfs: these are the so-called 'failed stars', with masses between stars and planets, that never manage to reach temperatures high enough for normal hydrogen fusion to occur(3). Recently, evidence for accretion in young brown dwarfs has mounted(4-6), and their spectra show lines that are suggestive of outflows(7-9). Here we report spectro-astrometric data that spatially resolve an outflow from a brown dwarf. The outflow's characteristics appear similar to, but on a smaller scale than, outflows from normal young stars. This result suggests that the outflow mechanism is universal, and perhaps relevant even to the formation of planets.","Dublin Inst Adv Studies, Dublin 2, Ireland; Osserv Astrofis Arcetri, INAF, I-50125 Florence, Italy","Whelan, ET (reprint author), Dublin Inst Adv Studies, 5 Merrion Sq, Dublin 2, Ireland.",ewhelan@cp.dias.ie,,"Randich, Sofia/0000-0003-2438-0899; BACCIOTTI, FRANCESCA/0000-0001-5776-9476",,,,19,84,84,0,2,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,2-Jun,2005,435,7042,,,,,652,654,,10.1038/nature03598,,3,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,931HK,WOS:000229476200044,15931217,No,,,11/20/17

Recent experiments on laser-induced demagnetization(6-8) and spin reorientation(9) use ultrafast lasers as a means to manipulate magnetization, accessing timescales of a picosecond or less. However, in all these cases the observed magnetic excitation is the result of optical absorption followed by a rapid temperature increase. This thermal origin of spin excitation considerably limits potential applications because the repetition frequency is limited by the cooling time(10). Here we demonstrate that circularly polarized femtosecond laser pulses can be used to non-thermally excite and coherently control the spin dynamics in magnets by way of the inverse Faraday effect. Such a photomagnetic interaction is instantaneous and is limited in time by the pulse width (similar to 200 fs in our experiment). Our finding thus reveals an alternative mechanism of ultrafast coherent spin control, and offers prospects for applications of ultrafast lasers in magnetic devices.","Radboud Univ Nijmegen, IMM, NL-6525 ED Nijmegen, Netherlands; AF Ioffe Phys Tech Inst, St Petersburg 194021, Russia; Moscow Power Engn Inst, Moscow 111250, Russia","Rasing, T (reprint author), Radboud Univ Nijmegen, IMM, NL-6525 ED Nijmegen, Netherlands.",th.rasing@science.ru.nl,"Kimel, Alexey/D-5112-2012; Rasing, Theo/D-5207-2012; Kirilyuk, Andrei/D-7798-2012; Usachev, Pavel/G-3310-2013","Kirilyuk, Andrei/0000-0003-1479-9872; Usachev, Pavel/0000-0002-1386-6466",,,,26,501,506,10,201,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,2-Jun,2005,435,7042,,,,,655,657,,10.1038/nature03564,,3,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,931HK,WOS:000229476200045,15917826,No,,,11/20/17

The characterization of two-terminal structures has become increasingly robust and reproducible(8-12), and for some systems detailed structural characterization of molecules on electrodes or insulators is available(13-17). Here we present scanning tunnelling microscopy observations and classical electrostatic and quantum mechanical modelling results that show that the electrostatic field emanating from a fixed point charge regulates the conductivity of nearby substrate-bound molecules. We find that the onset of molecular conduction is shifted by changing the charge state of a silicon surface atom, or by varying the spatial relationship between the molecule and that charged centre.

This cold interval has been connected to a decrease in the rate of North Atlantic Deep Water formation and to a resulting weakening of the meridional overturning circulation(2-4) owing to surface water freshening. In contrast, an earlier input of fresh water ( meltwater pulse 1a), whose origin is disputed(5,6), apparently did not lead to a reduction of the meridional overturning circulation(4). Here we analyse an ensemble of simulations of the drainage chronology of the North American ice sheet in order to identify the geographical release points of freshwater forcing during deglaciation. According to the simulations with our calibrated glacial systems model, the North American ice sheet contributed about half the fresh water of meltwater pulse 1a. During the onset of the Younger Dryas, we find that the largest combined meltwater/ iceberg discharge was directed into the Arctic Ocean. Given that the only drainage outlet from the Arctic Ocean was via the Fram Strait into the Greenland - Iceland - Norwegian seas(7), where North Atlantic Deep Water is formed today, we hypothesize that it was this Arctic freshwater flux that triggered the Younger Dryas cold reversal.","Univ Toronto, Dept Phys, Toronto, ON M5S 1A7, Canada","Tarasov, L (reprint author), Univ Toronto, Dept Phys, 60 St George St, Toronto, ON M5S 1A7, Canada.",lev@atmosp.physics.utoronto.ca,"Peltier, William/A-1102-2008",,,,,30,157,164,3,63,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,2-Jun,2005,435,7042,,,,,662,665,,10.1038/nature03617,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,931HK,WOS:000229476200047,15931219,No,,,11/20/17

Instead, its structural complexities probably rival those of the Earth's crust(1). Some regions of the lowermost mantle have been observed to have seismic wave speed reductions of at least 10 per cent(2-7), which appear not to be global in extent(7-9). Here we present robust evidence for an 8.5-km- thick and similar to 50-km-wide pocket of dense, partially molten material at the core - mantle boundary east of Australia. Array analyses of an anomalous precursor to the reflected seismic wave ScP reveal compressional and shear-wave velocity reductions of 8 and 25 per cent, respectively, and a 10 per cent increase in density of the partially molten aggregate. Seismological data are incompatible with a basal layer composed of pure melt, and thus require a mechanism to prevent downward percolation of dense melt within the layer. This may be possible by trapping of melt by cumulus crystal growth following melt drainage from an anomalously hot overlying region of the lowermost mantle. This magmatic evolution and the resulting cumulate structure seem to be associated with overlying thermal instabilities, and thus may mark a root zone of an upwelling plume.","Arizona State Univ, Dept Geol Sci, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA; Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Earth Sci, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA; Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA","Rost, S (reprint author), Arizona State Univ, Dept Geol Sci, Box 871404, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA.",srost@asu.edu,"Manga, Michael/D-3847-2013","Manga, Michael/0000-0003-3286-4682",,,,31,99,101,2,30,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,2-Jun,2005,435,7042,,,,,666,669,,10.1038/nature03620,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,931HK,WOS:000229476200048,15931220,No,,,11/20/17

The long neck is a particular hallmark of sauropod dinosaurs and is usually regarded as a key feeding adaptation(2). Here we describe a new dicraeosaurid sauropod, from the latest Jurassic period of Patagonia, that has a particularly short neck. With a neck that is about 40% shorter than in other known dicraeosaurs(3,4), this taxon demonstrates a trend opposite to that seen in most sauropods and indicates that the ecology of dicraeosaurids might have differed considerably from that of other sauropods.

Much recent evidence indicates that trust contributes to economic, political and social success(4,5). Little is known, however, about the biological basis of trust among humans. Here we show that intranasal administration of oxytocin, a neuropeptide that plays a key role in social attachment and affiliation in non-human mammals(6-8), causes a substantial increase in trust among humans, thereby greatly increasing the benefits from social interactions. We also show that the effect of oxytocin on trust is not due to a general increase in the readiness to bear risks. On the contrary, oxytocin specifically affects an individual's willingness to accept social risks arising through interpersonal interactions. These results concur with animal research suggesting an essential role for oxytocin as a biological basis of prosocial approach behaviour.","Univ Zurich, Inst Empir Res Econ, CH-8006 Zurich, Switzerland; Univ Zurich, Dept Clin Psychol & Psychotherapy, CH-8044 Zurich, Switzerland; Claremont Grad Univ, Ctr Neuroecon Studies, Claremont, CA 91711 USA; Collegium Helveticum, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland","Fehr, E (reprint author), Univ Zurich, Inst Empir Res Econ, Blumlisalpstr 10, CH-8006 Zurich, Switzerland.",m.heinrichs@psychologie.unizh.ch; efehr@iew.unizh.ch,"Fischbacher, Urs/H-2693-2014","Fischbacher, Urs/0000-0002-5115-8815",,,,30,1535,1566,30,508,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,2-Jun,2005,435,7042,,,,,673,676,,10.1038/nature03701,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,931HK,WOS:000229476200050,15931222,No,,,11/20/17

Bcl-X-L expression correlates with chemo-resistance of tumour cell lines(3), and reductions in Bcl-2 increase sensitivity to anticancer drugs(4) and enhance in vivo survival(5). The development of inhibitors of these proteins as potential anti-cancer therapeutics has been previously explored(6-15), but obtaining potent small-molecule inhibitors has proved difficult owing to the necessity of targeting a protein - protein interaction. Here, using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)-based screening, parallel synthesis and structure-based design, we have discovered ABT-737, a small-molecule inhibitor of the anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-2, Bcl-X-L and Bcl-w, with an affinity two to three orders of magnitude more potent than previously reported compounds(7-15). Mechanistic studies reveal that ABT-737 does not directly initiate the apoptotic process, but enhances the effects of death signals, displaying synergistic cytotoxicity with chemotherapeutics and radiation. ABT-737 exhibits single-agent-mechanism-based killing of cells from lymphoma and small-cell lung carcinoma lines, as well as primary patient-derived cells, and in animal models, ABT-737 improves survival, causes regression of established tumours, and produces cures in a high percentage of the mice.","Abbott Labs, Global Pharmaceut Res & Dev, Abbott Pk, IL 60064 USA; Idun Pharmaceut, San Diego, CA 92121 USA; Burnham Inst, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Boston, MA 02115 USA; Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dana Farber Canc Inst, Boston, MA 02115 USA; Univ Penn, Abramson Family Canc Res Inst, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA","Rosenberg, SH (reprint author), Abbott Labs, Global Pharmaceut Res & Dev, Abbott Pk, IL 60064 USA.",stephen.fesik@abbott.com; saul.rosenberg@abbott.com,,,,,,30,2104,2159,20,322,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,2-Jun,2005,435,7042,,,,,677,681,,10.1038/nature03579,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,931HK,WOS:000229476200051,15902208,No,,,11/20/17

Although one EBV miRNA probably altered the processing of a viral mRNA(2), the regulatory significance of this event is uncertain, because other transcripts exist that can supply the targeted function(3). Here we report the identification of miRNAs encoded by simian virus 40 (SV40) and define their functional significance for viral infection. SVmiRNAs accumulate at late times in infection, are perfectly complementary to early viral mRNAs, and target those mRNAs for cleavage. This reduces the expression of viral T antigens but does not reduce the yield of infectious virus relative to that generated by a mutant lacking SVmiRNAs. However, wild-type SV40-infected cells are less sensitive than the mutant to lysis by cytotoxic T cells, and trigger less cytokine production by such cells. Thus, viral evolution has taken advantage of the miRNA pathway to generate effectors that enhance the probability of successful infection.","Univ Calif San Francisco, George Williams Hooper Fdn, Howard Hughes Med Inst, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; Univ Calif San Francisco, George Williams Hooper Fdn, Dept Microbiol, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; Univ Calif San Francisco, George Williams Hooper Fdn, Dept Med, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; Penn State Univ, Coll Med, Dept Microbiol & Immunol, Hershey, PA 17033 USA; Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Biol Sci, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA","Ganem, D (reprint author), Univ Calif San Francisco, George Williams Hooper Fdn, Howard Hughes Med Inst, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA.",ganem@cgl.ucsf.edu,,,NCI NIH HHS [R01 CA073506],,,14,414,473,1,32,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,2-Jun,2005,435,7042,,,,,682,686,,10.1038/nature03576,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,931HK,WOS:000229476200052,15931223,No,,,11/20/17

SUMO conjugation occurs on specific lysine residues within protein targets, regulating pathways involved in differentiation, apoptosis, the cell cycle and responses to stress by altering protein function through changes in activity or cellular localization or by protecting substrates from ubiquitination(1,2). Ub/Ubl conjugation occurs in sequential steps and requires the concerted action of E2 conjugating proteins and E3 ligases(1,2). In addition to being a SUMO E3, the nucleoporin Nup358/RanBP2 localizes SUMO-conjugated RanGAP1 to the cytoplasmic face of the nuclear pore complex by means of interactions in a complex that also includes Ubc9, the SUMO E2 conjugating protein(3-6).

This active transport is driven by disassembly of the import complex by nuclear RanGTP(1-4). The switch I and II loops of Ran change conformation with nucleotide state(5-7), and regulate its interactions with nuclear trafficking components. Importin-beta consists of 19 HEAT repeats that are based on a pair of antiparallel alpha-helices ( referred to as the A- and B-helices). The HEAT repeats stack to yield two C-shaped arches, linked together to form a helicoidal molecule that has considerable conformational flexibility(1,8) (-12). Here we present the structure of full-length yeast importin-beta (Kap95p or karyopherin-beta) complexed with RanGTP, which provides a basis for understanding the crucial cargo-release step of nuclear import. We identify a key interaction site where the RanGTP switch I loop binds to the carboxy-terminal arch of Kap95p. This interaction produces a change in helicoidal pitch that locks Kap95p in a conformation that cannot bind importin-alpha or cargo.

The alpha-haemoglobin-stabilizing protein (AHSP) binds alpha-haemoglobin (alpha Hb), inhibits the ability of alpha Hb to generate reactive oxygen species and prevents its precipitation on exposure to oxidant stress(3-5). The structure of AHSP bound to ferrous alpha Hb is thought to represent a transitional complex through which alpha Hb is converted to a non-reactive, hexacoordinate ferric form(5). Here we report the crystal structure of this ferric alpha Hb - AHSP complex at 2.4 angstrom resolution. Our findings reveal a striking bis-histidyl configuration in which both the proximal and the distal histidines coordinate the haem iron atom. To attain this unusual conformation, segments of alpha Hb undergo drastic structural rearrangements, including the repositioning of several alpha-helices. Moreover, conversion to the ferric bis-histidine configuration strongly and specifically inhibits redox chemistry catalysis and haem loss from alpha Hb. The observed structural changes, which impair the chemical reactivity of haem iron, explain how AHSP stabilizes alpha Hb and prevents its damaging effects in cells.","Childrens Hosp Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; Princeton Univ, Dept Mol Biol, Lewis Thomas Lab, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; Univ Penn, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; Univ Sydney, Sch Mol & Microbial Biosci, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia","Gow, AJ (reprint author), Childrens Hosp Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",gow@email.chop.edu; yshi@molbio.princeton.edu,"Weiss, Mitchell/A-1245-2013; Gow, Andrew/N-8566-2013","Gow, Andrew/0000-0003-0876-5158; Mackay, Joel/0000-0001-7508-8033",NIDDK NIH HHS [R01 DK061692],,,30,73,79,2,26,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,2-Jun,2005,435,7042,,,,,697,701,,10.1038/nature03609,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,931HK,WOS:000229476200055,15931225,No,,,11/20/17

Recent studies indicate that auxin acts by promoting the degradation of the Aux/IAA transcriptional repressors through the action of the ubiquitin protein ligase SCFTIR1. The nature of the signalling cascade that leads to this effect is not known. However, recent studies indicate that the auxin receptor and other signalling components involved in this response are soluble factors. Using an in vitro pull-down assay, we demonstrate that the interaction between transport inhibitor response 1 (TIR1) and Aux/IAA proteins does not require stable modification of either protein. Instead auxin promotes the Aux/IAA-SCFTIR1 interaction by binding directly to SCFTIR1. We further show that the loss of TIR1 and three related F-box proteins eliminates saturable auxin binding in plant extracts. Finally, TIR1 synthesized in insect cells binds Aux/IAA proteins in an auxin-dependent manner. Together, these results indicate that TIR1 is an auxin receptor that mediates Aux/IAA degradation and auxin-regulated transcription.","Indiana Univ, Dept Biol, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA","Estelle, M (reprint author), Indiana Univ, Dept Biol, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA.",maestell@indiana.edu,,,,,,30,1031,1142,12,222,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,26-May,2005,435,7041,,,,,441,445,,10.1038/nature03543,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,929IF,WOS:000229337800043,15917797,No,,,11/20/17

Regulated SCF-mediated protein degradation is a widely occurring signal transduction mechanism. Target specificity is conferred by the F-box protein subunit of the SCF (TIR1 in the case of Aux/IAAs) and there are multiple F-box protein genes in all eukaryotic genomes examined so far. Although SCF - target interaction is usually regulated by signal-induced modification of the target, we have previously shown that auxin signalling involves the modification of SCFTIR1.

Here we systematically screen the mouse genome for autoimmune regulators to isolate a mouse strain, sanroque, with severe autoimmune disease resulting from a single recessive defect in a previously unknown mechanism for repressing antibody responses to self. The sanroque mutation acts within mature T cells to cause formation of excessive numbers of follicular helper T cells and germinal centres. The mutation disrupts a repressor of ICOS, an essential co-stimulatory receptor for follicular T cells, and results in excessive production of the cytokine interleukin-21. sanroque mice fail to repress diabetes-causing T cells, and develop high titres of autoantibodies and a pattern of pathology consistent with lupus. The causative mutation is in a gene of previously unknown function, roquin (Rc3h1), which encodes a highly conserved member of the RING-type ubiquitin ligase protein family. The Roquin protein is distinguished by the presence of a CCCH zinc-finger found in RNA-binding proteins, and localization to cytosolic RNA granules implicated in regulating messenger RNA translation and stability.","Australian Natl Univ, John Curtin Sch Med Res, Div Immunol & Genet, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia; Australian Natl Univ, Sch Med, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia; Australian Phenom Facil, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia; Univ Oxford, Oxford OX3 9DU, England; John Radcliffe Hosp, Dept Cellular Pathol, Oxford OX3 9DU, England; Univ Oxford, Wellcome Trust Ctr Human Genet, Oxford OX3 7BN, England","Vinuesa, CG (reprint author), Australian Natl Univ, John Curtin Sch Med Res, Div Immunol & Genet, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia.",carola.vinuesa@anu.edu.au; chris.goodnow@anu.edu.au,"Yu, Di/C-2163-2009; Vinuesa, Carola/B-1108-2010; Lambe, Teresa/E-5733-2016","Yu, Di/0000-0003-1721-8922; Vinuesa, Carola/0000-0001-9799-0298; Lambe, Teresa/0000-0001-7711-897X",,,,50,505,528,1,23,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,26-May,2005,435,7041,,,,,452,458,,10.1038/nature03555,,7,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,929IF,WOS:000229337800045,15917799,No,,,11/20/17

Several models have been proposed to explain a late impact spike(3-6), but none of them has been set within a self-consistent framework of Solar System evolution. Here we propose that the LHB was triggered by the rapid migration of the giant planets, which occurred after a long quiescent period. During this burst of migration, the planetesimal disk outside the orbits of the planets was destabilized, causing a sudden massive delivery of planetesimals to the inner Solar System. The asteroid belt was also strongly perturbed, with these objects supplying a significant fraction of the LHB impactors in accordance with recent geochemical evidence(7,8).

The interference takes place within a single molecule and within one optical cycle.

The superconducting critical current density (J(c)) across a grain boundary drops exponentially if the misorientation angle exceeds 2 degrees- 7 degrees. Grain texturing reduces the average misorientation angle, but problems persist(7,8). Adding impurities ( such as Ca in YBa2Cu3O7-delta; YBCO) leads to increased J(c) (refs 9, 10), which is generally attributed to excess holes introduced by Ca2+ substituting for Y3+ (ref. 11). However, a comprehensive physical model for the role of grain boundaries and Ca doping has remained elusive. Here we report calculations, imaging and spectroscopy at the atomic scale that demonstrate that in poly-crystalline YBCO, highly strained grain-boundary regions contain excess O vacancies, which reduce the local hole concentration. The Ca impurities indeed substitute for Y, but in grain-boundary regions under compression and tension they also replace Ba and Cu, relieving strain and suppressing O-vacancy formation.

They are characterized by carbon-isotope excursions in marine(3) and terrestrial(4) reservoirs and mass extinction of marine faunas(5). Causal mechanisms for the enhancement of organic carbon burial during OAEs are still debated(6,7), but it is thought that such events should draw down significant quantities of atmospheric carbon dioxide(7). In the case of the Toarcian OAE (similar to 183 million years ago), a short-lived negative carbon-isotope excursion in oceanic and terrestrial reservoirs has been interpreted to indicate raised atmospheric carbon dioxide(4) caused by oxidation of methane catastrophically released from either marine gas hydrates(4) or magma-intruded organic-rich rocks(8). Here we test these two leading hypotheses(4,8) for a negative carbon isotopic excursion marking the initiation of the Toarcian OAE using a high-resolution atmospheric carbon dioxide record obtained from fossil leaf stomatal frequency(9,10). We find that coincident with the negative carbon-isotope excursion carbon dioxide is first drawn down by 350 +/- 100 p. p. m. v. and then abruptly elevated by 1,200 6 400 p. p. m. v, and infer a global cooling and greenhouse warming of 2.5 +/- 0.1 degrees C and 6.5 +/- 1 degrees C, respectively. The pattern and magnitude of carbon dioxide change are difficult to reconcile with catastrophic input of isotopically light methane from hydrates(5) as the cause of the negative isotopic signal. Our carbon dioxide record better supports a magma-intrusion hypothesis(8), and suggests that injection of isotopically light carbon from the release of thermogenic methane occurred owing to the intrusion of Gondwana coals by Toarcian-aged Karoo-Ferrar dolerites.","Field Museum Nat Hist, Dept Geol, Chicago, IL 60605 USA; Univ Chicago, Dept Ecol & Evolut, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; Univ Oxford, Dept Earth Sci, Oxford OX1 3PR, England","McElwain, JC (reprint author), Field Museum Nat Hist, Dept Geol, 1400 S Lake Shore Dr, Chicago, IL 60605 USA.",jmcelwain@fieldmuseum.org,"McElwain, Jennifer/B-1735-2009","McElwain, Jennifer/0000-0002-1729-6755",,,,30,208,213,0,48,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,26-May,2005,435,7041,,,,,479,482,,10.1038/nature03618,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,929IF,WOS:000229337800051,15917805,No,,,11/20/17

The density jump at the inner-core boundary - an important parameter determining gravitational energy release(10) and constraining the compositional difference between the inner and outer core - is also not well known. Estimates of this density jump obtained using free-oscillation eigenfrequencies give low values(11-13) of 0.25-1.0 g cm(-3), whereas a method using the amplitude ratio of core-reflected phases yielded values of 0.6 - 1.8 g cm(-3) ( refs 14 - 17).

Experiments with captive animals often indicate that PSM concentrations influence how much herbivores eat from individual plants(3-7), but these experiments do not replicate the subtle tradeoffs in diet selection faced by wild animals, which must avoid predators and extremes of weather, interact with conspecifics, and achieve a balanced, nutritious diet, while avoiding intoxication by PSMs. We characterized the foliar chemistry of every tree from two Eucalyptus species available to a population of koalas (Phascolarctos cinereus) and considered rates of tree visitation over a ten-year period. We show that visitation rate was most strongly influenced by tree size, but that koalas also visited trees less frequently if the foliage contained either high concentrations of deterrent PSMs known as formylated phloroglucinol compounds, or low concentrations of nitrogen. Consequently, plant chemistry restricts the use of trees by this herbivore, and thus limits the food available to koalas and potentially influences koala populations.","Australian Natl Univ, Sch Bot & Zool, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia","Moore, BD (reprint author), James Cook Univ N Queensland, Sch Trop Biol, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia.",Ben.Moore@jcu.edu.au,"Moore, Ben/C-3447-2008; Foley, William/C-8069-2009","Moore, Ben/0000-0002-6995-4721; Foley, William/0000-0001-8587-1814",,,,29,99,105,3,73,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,26-May,2005,435,7041,,,,,488,490,,10.1038/nature03551,,3,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,929IF,WOS:000229337800053,15917807,No,,,11/20/17

We investigated whether the potentiation of neurotransmitter release by phorbol esters(1-3), which target presynaptic protein kinase C (PKC)/munc-13 signalling cascades(4-6), exerts a direct effect on the Ca2+-sensitivity of vesicle fusion. Using direct presynaptic Ca2+-manipulation and Ca2+ uncaging at a giant presynaptic terminal, the calyx of Held, we show that phorbol esters potentiate transmitter release by increasing the apparent Ca2+-sensitivity of vesicle fusion. Phorbol esters potentiate Ca2+-evoked release as well as the spontaneous release rate. We explain both effects by an increased fusion 'willingness' in a new allosteric model of Ca2+-activation of vesicle fusion. In agreement with an allosteric mechanism, we observe that the classically high Ca2+ cooperativity in triggering vesicle fusion (similar to 4) is gradually reduced below 3 mu M [Ca2+](i), reaching a value of < 1 at basal [Ca2+](i). Our data indicate that spontaneous transmitter release close to resting [Ca2+](i) is a consequence of an intrinsic property of the molecular machinery(7,8) that mediates synaptic vesicle fusion.","Max Planck Inst Biophys Chem, AG Synapt Dynam & Modulat, D-37077 Gottingen, Germany; Max Planck Inst Biophys Chem, Abt Membranbiophys, D-37077 Gottingen, Germany","Schneggenburger, R (reprint author), Max Planck Inst Biophys Chem, AG Synapt Dynam & Modulat, Fassberg 11, D-37077 Gottingen, Germany.",rschneg@gwdg.de,"Volker, Scheuss/G-7846-2015",,,,,28,162,163,2,28,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,26-May,2005,435,7041,,,,,497,501,,10.1038/nature03568,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,929IF,WOS:000229337800055,15917809,No,,,11/20/17

Arterial walls undergo regional disturbances of metabolism(2) that include the uncoupling of respiration and oxidative phosphorylation, a process that occurs to some extent in all cells and may be characteristic of blood vessels being predisposed to the development of atherosclerosis(3). To test the hypothesis that inefficient metabolism in blood vessels promotes vascular disease, we generated mice with doxycycline-inducible expression of uncoupling protein-1 (UCP1) in the artery wall. Here we show that UCP1 expression in aortic smooth muscle cells causes hypertension and increases dietary atherosclerosis without affecting cholesterol levels.

In Schizosaccharomyces pombe these responses include the transcription of specific gene sets and inhibition of entry into mitosis(1,2). The S. pombe stress response pathway (SRP) also promotes commitment to mitosis in unperturbed cell cycles to allow cells to match their rate of division with nutrient availability(1,3). The nature of this SRP function in cell cycle control is unknown. Entry into mitosis is controlled by mitosis-promoting factor (MPF; Cdc2/cyclin B) activity. Inhibitory phosphorylation of Cdc2 by Wee1 kinase inactivates MPF until Cdc25 removes this phosphate to promote mitosis(4). The balance between Wee1 and Cdc25 activities is influenced by the recruitment of polo kinase (Plo1) to the spindle pole body (SPB)(5). The SPB component Cut12 mediates this recruitment(5,6). Hyper-activating mutations in either cut12 or plo1 enable Cdc25-defective cells to enter mitosis(5,7). The hyperactive cut12.s11 mutation suppresses cdc25.22, as it promotes recruitment of active Plo1 to interphase SPBs(6,7). Here we show that the SRP promotes phosphorylation of Plo1 on Ser 402. In unperturbed cell cycles, SRP-mediated phosphorylation of Ser 402 promotes Plo1 recruitment to SPBs and thus commitment to mitosis. Ser 402 phosphorylation also ensures efficient reinitiation of cell tip growth and cell division during recovery from particular stresses. Thus, phosphorylation of Plo1 Ser 402 not only enables SRP signalling to modulate the timing of mitotic commitment in response to nutrient status in unperturbed cycles, but also promotes the return to normal cell cycle control after stress.","Paterson Inst Canc Res, Canc Res UK Cell Div Grp, Manchester M20 4BX, Lancs, England; Rockefeller Univ, New York, NY 10021 USA","Hagan, IM (reprint author), Paterson Inst Canc Res, Canc Res UK Cell Div Grp, Wilmslow Rd, Manchester M20 4BX, Lancs, England.",ihagan@picr.man.ac.uk,,"Hagan, Iain/0000-0002-5858-9415",,,,28,80,83,0,2,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,26-May,2005,435,7041,,,,,507,512,,10.1038/nature03590,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,929IF,WOS:000229337800057,15917811,No,,,11/20/17

Upon binding of activated Rho proteins, the DAD is released and the ability of the formin to nucleate and elongate unbranched actin filaments is induced. Here we present the crystal structure of RhoC in complex with the regulatory N terminus of mammalian Diaphanous 1 (mDia1) containing the GBD/FH3 region, an all-helical structure with armadillo repeats. Rho uses its 'switch' regions for interacting with two subdomains of GBD/FH3. We show that the FH3 domain of mDia1 forms a stable dimer and we also identify the DAD-binding site.

Initiation of new microtubules in vivo requires gamma-tubulin, organized as an oligomer within the 2.2-MDa gamma-tubulin ring complex (gamma-TuRC) of higher eukaryotes(1-3). Structural insight is lacking regarding gamma-tubulin, its oligomerization and how it promotes microtubule assembly. Here we report the 2.7-angstrom crystal structure of human gamma-tubulin bound to GTP-gamma S ( a non-hydrolysable GTP analogue). We observe a 'curved' conformation for gamma-tubulin -GTP gamma S, similar to that seen for GDP-bound, unpolymerized alpha beta-tubulin(4). Tubulins are thought to represent a distinct class of GTP-binding proteins, and conformational switching in gamma-tubulin might differ from the nucleotide-dependent switching of signalling GTPases. A crystal packing interaction replicates the lateral contacts between alpha- and beta-tubulins in the microtubule(5), and this association probably forms the basis for gamma-tubulin oligomerization within the gamma-TuRC. Laterally associated gamma-tubulins in the gamma-TuRC might promote microtubule nucleation by providing a template that enhances the intrinsically weak lateral interaction between alpha beta-tubulin heterodimers. Because they are dimeric, alpha beta-tubulins cannot form microtubule-like lateral associations in the curved conformation(5). The lateral array of gamma-tubulins we observe in the crystal reveals a unique functional property of a monomeric tubulin.","Univ Calif San Francisco, Howard Hughes Med Inst, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Biochem & Biophys, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; Stanford Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Stanford, CA 94305 USA","Agard, DA (reprint author), Univ Calif San Francisco, Howard Hughes Med Inst, 600 16th St, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA.",agard@msg.ucsf.edu,,,,,,15,94,95,0,14,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,26-May,2005,435,7041,,,,,523,527,,10.1038/nature03586,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,929IF,WOS:000229337800060,15917813,No,,,11/20/17

We derive the full vector displacement field due to the Bam, Iran, earthquake of moment magnitude 6.5 using radar data from the Envisat satellite of the European Space Agency. Analysis of surface deformation indicates that most of the seismic moment release along the 20-km-long strike-slip rupture occurred at a shallow depth of 4 - 5 km, yet the rupture did not break the surface. The Bam event may therefore represent an end-member case of the 'shallow slip deficit' model, which postulates that coseismic slip in the uppermost crust is systematically less than that at seismogenic depths ( 4 - 10 km). The InSAR-derived surface displacement data from the Bam and other large shallow earthquakes suggest that the uppermost section of the seismogenic crust around young and developing faults may undergo a distributed failure in the interseismic period, thereby accumulating little elastic strain.","Univ Calif San Diego, Scripps Inst Oceanog, Inst Geophys & Planetary Phys, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; CALTECH, Div Geol & Planetary Sci, Seismol Lab, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA; CALTECH, Jet Prop Lab, Pasadena, CA 91109 USA","Fialko, Y (reprint author), Univ Calif San Diego, Scripps Inst Oceanog, Inst Geophys & Planetary Phys, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.",fialko@radar.ucsd.edu,"Fialko, Yuri/B-9567-2012; Simons, Mark/N-4397-2015","Fialko, Yuri/0000-0002-6161-8467; Simons, Mark/0000-0003-1412-6395; Sandwell, David/0000-0001-5657-8707",,,,47,173,193,4,30,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,19-May,2005,435,7040,,,,,295,299,,10.1038/nature03425,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,927HM,WOS:000229185000035,15902247,No,,,11/20/17

This dynamic nature of cortical circuitry is important for learning, as well as for repair after injury to the nervous system. Electrophysiology studies suggest that adult macaque primary visual cortex (V1) undergoes large-scale reorganization within a few months after retinal lesioning, but this issue has not been conclusively settled. Here we applied the technique of functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI) to detect changes in the cortical topography of macaque area V1 after binocular retinal lesions. fMRI allows non-invasive, in vivo, long-term monitoring of cortical activity with a wide field of view, sampling signals from multiple neurons per unit cortical area. We show that, in contrast with previous studies, adult macaque V1 does not approach normal responsivity during 7.5 months of follow-up after retinal lesions, and its topography does not change. Electrophysiology experiments corroborated the fMRI results. This indicates that adult macaque V1 has limited potential for reorganization in the months following retinal injury.","Max Planck Inst Biol Cybernet, D-72076 Tubingen, Germany; Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Dept Neurol, Boston, MA 02114 USA; Stanford Univ, Dept Psychol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; Stanford Univ, Neurosci Program, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; Univ Tubingen, Dept Ophthalmol 1, D-72076 Tubingen, Germany","Smirnakis, SM (reprint author), Max Planck Inst Biol Cybernet, Spemannstr 38, D-72076 Tubingen, Germany.",smsmirnakis@partners.org,"Schmid, Michael/G-1867-2010","Schmid, Michael/0000-0003-1424-130X",NINDS NIH HHS [F30 NS044759],,,47,117,121,0,12,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,19-May,2005,435,7040,,,,,300,307,,10.1038/nature03495,,8,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,927HM,WOS:000229185000036,15902248,No,,,11/20/17

We find that both forward and backward 8-nm steps occur on the microsecond timescale and that both occur without mechanical substeps on this timescale.

To resolve these questions, larger detectors with higher duty cycles and which combine multiple detection techniques(3) are needed.

Here we report the detection of radio flashes from cosmic-ray air showers using low-cost digital radio receivers. We show that the radiation can be understood in terms of the geosynchrotron effect(4-8).

Most processes fractionate isotopes by nuclear mass; that is, O-18 is twice as fractionated as O-17, relative to O-16. In CAIs O-17 and O-18 are nearly equally fractionated, implying a fundamentally different mechanism. The CAI data were originally interpreted as evidence for supernova input of pure O-16 into the solar nebula(1), but the lack of a similar isotope trend in other elements argues against this explanation(2). A symmetry-dependent fractionation mechanism(3,4) may have occurred in the inner solar nebula(5), but experimental evidence is lacking. Isotope-selective photodissociation of CO in the innermost solar nebula(6) might explain the CAI data, but the high temperatures in this region would have rapidly erased the signature(7). Here we report time-dependent calculations of CO photodissociation in the cooler surface region of a turbulent nebula. If the surface were irradiated by a far-ultraviolet flux &SIM; 10(3) times that of the local interstellar medium ( for example, owing to an O or B star within,1 pc of the protosun), then substantial fractionation of the oxygen isotopes was possible on a timescale of &SIM; 10(5) years.

The implementation of optical interconnections relies on the development of micro-optical devices that are integrated with the microelectronics on chips. Recent demonstrations of silicon low-loss waveguides(5-7), light emitters(8), amplifiers(9-11) and lasers(12,13) approach this goal, but a small silicon electro-optic modulator with a size small enough for chip-scale integration has not yet been demonstrated.

The modulator is based on a resonant light-confining structure that enhances the sensitivity of light to small changes in refractive index of the silicon and also enables high-speed operation.

These forecasts describe the probability and number of events that are, on average, likely to occur following a mainshock of a given magnitude, but are not tailored to the particular sequence at hand and contain no information about the likely locations of the aftershocks. Our model builds upon the basic principles of this generic forecast model in two ways: it recasts the forecast in terms of the probability of strong ground shaking, and it combines an existing time-independent earthquake occurrence model based on fault data and historical earthquakes(5) with increasingly complex models describing the local time-dependent earthquake clustering(1,2). The result is a time-dependent map showing the probability of strong shaking anywhere in California within the next 24 hours.

The four tooth samples yielded uncalibrated ages of similar to 31,000 C-14 years before present, and the bone sample ( an ulna) provided an uncertain more-recent age.

Worries over sudden climate change and irreversible changes in ecosystems are rooted in the potential that nonlinear systems have for complex and 'pathological' behaviours(1,2). Nonlinear behaviours have been shown in model systems(3) and in some natural systems(1,4-8), but their occurrence in large-scale marine environments remains controversial(9,10). Here we show that time series observations of key physical variables(11-14) for the North Pacific Ocean that seem to show these behaviours are not deterministically nonlinear, and are best described as linear stochastic. In contrast, we find that time series for biological variables(5,15-17) having similar properties exhibit a low-dimensional nonlinear signature. To our knowledge, this is the first direct test for nonlinearity in large-scale physical and biological data for the marine environment. These results address a continuing debate over the origin of rapid shifts in certain key marine observations as coming from essentially stochastic processes or from dominant nonlinear mechanisms(1,9,10,18-20). Our measurements suggest that large-scale marine ecosystems are dynamically nonlinear, and as such have the capacity for dramatic change in response to stochastic fluctuations in basin-scale physical states.","Univ Calif San Diego, Scripps Inst Oceanog, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA","Sugihara, G (reprint author), Univ Calif San Diego, Scripps Inst Oceanog, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.",gsugihara@ucsd.edu,"Hsieh, Chih-hao/B-3797-2008","Hsieh, Chih-hao/0000-0001-5935-7272",,,,29,186,189,3,64,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,19-May,2005,435,7040,,,,,336,340,,10.1038/nature03553,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,927HM,WOS:000229185000044,15902256,No,,,11/20/17

The number of action potentials evoked by each stimulus usually does not increase with increasing stimulus duration(1,5-7). Such observations have long puzzled researchers across disciplines and raised serious questions regarding the role of the auditory cortex in encoding ongoing acoustic signals. Contrary to these long-held views, here we show that single neurons in both primary ( area A1) and lateral belt areas of the auditory cortex of awake marmoset monkeys ( Callithrix jacchus) are capable of firing in a sustained manner over a prolonged period of time, especially when they are driven by their preferred stimuli. In contrast, responses become more transient or phasic when auditory cortex neurons respond to non-preferred stimuli. These findings suggest that when the auditory cortex is stimulated by a sound, a particular population of neurons fire maximally throughout the duration of the sound. Responses of other, less optimally driven neurons fade away quickly after stimulus onset. This results in a selective representation of the sound across both neuronal population and time.","Johns Hopkins Univ, Sch Med, Dept Biomed Engn, Lab Auditory Neurophysiol, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA","Wang, XQ (reprint author), Johns Hopkins Univ, Sch Med, Dept Biomed Engn, Lab Auditory Neurophysiol, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA.",xwang@bme.jhu.edu,,,,,,30,217,220,2,22,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,19-May,2005,435,7040,,,,,341,346,,10.1038/nature03565,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,927HM,WOS:000229185000045,15902257,No,,,11/20/17

Mammalian 2-Cys peroxiredoxin type II ( Prx II; gene symbol Prdx2) is a cellular peroxidase that eliminates endogenous H2O2 produced in response to growth factors such as PDGF and epidermal growth factor(4); however, its involvement in growth factor signalling is largely unknown. Here we show that Prx II is a negative regulator of PDGF signalling. Prx II deficiency results in increased production of H2O2, enhanced activation of PDGF receptor ( PDGFR) and phospholipase C&gamma; 1, and subsequently increased cell proliferation and migration in response to PDGF. These responses are suppressed by expression of wild-type Prx II, but not an inactive mutant. Notably, Prx II is recruited to PDGFR upon PDGF stimulation, and suppresses protein tyrosine phosphatase inactivation. Prx II also leads to the suppression of PDGFR activation in primary culture and a murine restenosis model, including PDGF-dependent neointimal thickening of vascular smooth muscle cells. These results demonstrate a localized role for endogenous H2O2 in PDGF signalling, and indicate a biological function of Prx II in cardiovascular disease.","Ewha Womans Univ, Div Mol Life Sci, Seoul 120750, South Korea; Ewha Womans Univ, Ctr Cell Signaling Res, Seoul 120750, South Korea; Yonsei Univ, Coll Med, Dept Neurol, Seoul 120752, South Korea; Korea Res Inst Biosci & Biotechnol, Lab Human Genom, Taejon 305333, South Korea; Labfrontier Co Ltd, Inst Life Sci, Suwon 442766, Kyunggi Do, South Korea; NHLBI, Lab Cell Signaling, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; Korea Adv Inst Sci & Technol, Dept Biosyst, Taejon 305701, South Korea","Rhee, SG (reprint author), Ewha Womans Univ, Div Mol Life Sci, Seoul 120750, South Korea.",sgrhee@nih.gov,"Choi, Chulhee/C-1642-2011","Choi, Chulhee/0000-0001-5542-9136",,,,23,250,260,1,27,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,19-May,2005,435,7040,,,,,347,353,,10.1038/nature03587,,7,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,927HM,WOS:000229185000046,15902258,No,,,11/20/17

A 'clock and wavefront' model has been proposed to explain the underlying mechanism of somite formation(1), in which the periodicity is generated by oscillation of Notch components ( the clock) in the posterior pre-somitic mesoderm (PSM)(2-6). This temporal periodicity is then translated into the segmental units in the 'wavefront'(7,8). The wavefront is thought to exist in the anterior PSM and progress backwards at a constant rate; however, there has been no direct evidence as to whether the levels of Notch activity really oscillate and how such oscillation is translated into a segmental pattern in the anterior PSM. Here, we have visualized endogenous levels of Notch1 activity in mice, showing that it oscillates in the posterior PSM but is arrested in the anterior PSM. Somite boundaries formed at the interface between Notch1-activated and - repressed domains. Genetic and biochemical studies indicate that this interface is generated by suppression of Notch activity by mesoderm posterior 2 (Mesp2) through induction of the lunatic fringe gene (Lfng).

Ter is also a potent modifier of spontaneous testicular germ cell tumour (TGCT) susceptibility in the 129 family of inbred strains, and markedly increases TGCT incidence in 129-Ter/Termales(2-4). In 129-Ter/Ter mice, some of the remaining PGCs transform into undifferentiated pluripotent embryonal carcinoma cells(2-6), and after birth differentiate into various cells and tissues that compose TGCTs. Here, we report the positional cloning of Ter, revealing a point mutation that introduces a termination codon in the mouse orthologue (Dnd1) of the zebrafish dead end (dnd) gene. PGC deficiency is corrected both with bacterial artificial chromosomes that contain Dnd1 and with a Dnd1-encoding transgene. Dnd1 is expressed in fetal gonads during the critical period when TGCTs originate. DND1 has an RNA recognition motif and is most similar to the apobec complementation factor, a component of the cytidine to uridine RNA-editing complex. These results suggest that Ter may adversely affect essential aspects of RNA biology during PGC development. DND1 is the first protein known to have an RNA recognition motif directly implicated as a heritable cause of spontaneous tumorigenesis. TGCT development in the 129-Ter mouse strain models paediatric TGCT in humans. This work will have important implications for our understanding of the genetic control of TGCT pathogenesis and PGC biology.","Univ Texas, MD Anderson Canc Ctr, Dept Mol Genet, Houston, TX 77030 USA; Case Western Reserve Univ, Dept Genet, Cleveland, OH 44106 USA; Case Western Reserve Univ, Case Comprehens Canc Ctr, Cleveland, OH 44106 USA; Duke Univ, Dept Cell Biol, Durham, NC 27710 USA; SAIC Frederick Inc, Basic Res Program, Frederick, MD 21702 USA; NCI, Immunobiol Lab, Frederick, MD 21702 USA; Univ Calif Berkeley, Lawrence Berkeley Lab, Genome Sci Dept, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA","Nadeau, JH (reprint author), Univ Texas, MD Anderson Canc Ctr, Dept Mol Genet, Houston, TX 77030 USA.",jhn4@case.edu; amatin@mdanderson.org,,,"NCI NIH HHS [P30 CA016672, R01 CA075056, R01 CA093754]; NHLBI NIH HHS [R01 HL063054]",,,30,208,221,3,11,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,19-May,2005,435,7040,,,,,360,364,,10.1038/nature03595,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,927HM,WOS:000229185000048,15902260,No,,,11/20/17

In plants and fungi, protrusion is driven primarily by hydrostatic pressure(4-6). For hydrostatic pressure to drive localized protrusion in animal cells(7,8), it would have to be locally regulated, but current models treating cytoplasm as an incompressible viscoelastic continuum(9) or viscous liquid(10) require that hydrostatic pressure equilibrates essentially instantaneously over the whole cell. Here, we use cell blebs as reporters of local pressure in the cytoplasm. When we locally perfuse blebbing cells with cortex-relaxing drugs to dissipate pressure on one side, blebbing continues on the untreated side, implying non-equilibration of pressure on scales of approximately 10 mu m and 10 s. We can account for localization of pressure by considering the cytoplasm as a contractile, elastic network infiltrated by cytosol.

Here, we report that T7 DNA polymerase, which is unable to catalyse strand displacement DNA synthesis by itself, can increase the unwinding rate to 114 base pairs per second, bringing the helicase up to similar speeds compared to its translocation along ssDNA. The helicase rate of stimulation depends upon the DNA synthesis rate and does not rely on specific interactions between T7 DNA polymerase and the carboxy-terminal residues of T7 helicase. Efficient duplex DNA synthesis is achieved only by the combined action of the helicase and polymerase. The strand displacement DNA synthesis by the DNA polymerase depends on the unwinding activity of the helicase, which provides ssDNA template. The rapid trapping of the ssDNA bases by the DNA synthesis activity of the polymerase in turn drives the helicase to move forward through duplex DNA at speeds similar to those observed along ssDNA.","Univ Med & Dent New Jersey, Robert Wood Johnson Med Sch, Dept Biochem, Piscataway, NJ 08854 USA; Kookmin Univ, Dept Bio & Nanochem, Seoul 136702, South Korea; Univ Connecticut, Ctr Hlth, Ctr Cell Anal & Modeling, Farmington, CT 06030 USA","Patel, SS (reprint author), Univ Med & Dent New Jersey, Robert Wood Johnson Med Sch, Dept Biochem, 675 Hoes Lane, Piscataway, NJ 08854 USA.",patelss@umdnj.edu,,,NIGMS NIH HHS [R01 GM055310],,,25,89,89,0,12,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,19-May,2005,435,7040,,,,,370,373,,10.1038/nature03615,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,927HM,WOS:000229185000050,15902262,No,,,11/20/17

Chronic infections can lead to cirrhosis and liver cancer. The RNA replication machine of HCV is a multi-subunit membrane-associated complex. The nonstructural protein NS5A is an active component of HCV replicase(2,3), as well as a pivotal regulator of replication(2,4) and a modulator of cellular processes ranging from innate immunity to dysregulated cell growth(5,6). NS5A is a large phosphoprotein (56 - 58 kDa) with an amphipathic &alpha;-helix at its amino terminus that promotes membrane association(7-9). After this helix region, NS5A is organized into three domains(10). The N-terminal domain ( domain I) coordinates a single zinc atom per protein molecule(10). Mutations disrupting either the membrane anchor(7,8) or zinc binding(10) of NS5A are lethal for RNA replication.

In mouse embryonic development, the symmetry-breaking process in left - right determination is initiated by a leftward extraembryonic fluid flow on the surface of the ventral node. However, it is not known whether the signal transduction mechanism of this flow is chemical or mechanical. Here we show that fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signalling triggers secretion of membrane-sheathed objects 0.3 - 5 mu m in diameter termed 'nodal vesicular parcels' (NVPs) that carry Sonic hedgehog and retinoic acid. These NVPs are transported leftward by the fluid flow and eventually fragment close to the left wall of the ventral node. The silencing effects of the FGF-receptor inhibitor SU5402 on NVP secretion and on a downstream rise in Ca2+ were sufficiently reversed by exogenous Sonic hedgehog peptide or retinoic acid, suggesting that FGF-triggered surface accumulation of cargo morphogens may be essential for launching NVPs. Thus, we propose that NVP flow is a new mode of extracellular transport that forms a left - right gradient of morphogens.","Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Med, Dept Cell Biol & Anat, Tokyo 1130033, Japan","Hirokawa, N (reprint author), Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Med, Dept Cell Biol & Anat, Tokyo 1130033, Japan.",hirokawa@m.u-tokyo.ac.jp,,"Okada, Yasushi/0000-0003-2601-3689",,,,32,320,327,3,37,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,12-May,2005,435,7039,,,,,172,177,,10.1038/nature03494,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,924ZO,WOS:000229021100031,15889083,No,,,11/20/17

Although observations of afterglows(5) continue to refine our understanding of GRB progenitors and relativistic shocks, gamma-ray observations alone have not yielded a clear picture of the origin of the prompt emission(6) nor details of the central engine.

Here we present observations and climate modelling that indicate the south pole of Mars is characterized by two distinct regional climates that are the result of dynamical forcing by the largest southern impact basins, Argyre and Hellas. The style of surface frost deposition is controlled by these regional climates. In the cold and stormy conditions that exist poleward of 60 degrees S and extend 180 degrees in longitude west from the Mountains of Mitchel (similar to 30 degrees W), surface frost accumulation is dominated by precipitation. In the opposite hemisphere, the polar atmosphere is relatively warm and clear and frost accumulation is dominated by direct vapour deposition.

However, there are theoretical(4-6) and experimental(7-14) results that challenge this approach. Specifically, it has been claimed(4-6) that stress in granular solids propagates in a manner described by wave-like ( hyperbolic) equations, rather than the elliptic equations of static elasticity. Here we report numerical simulations of the response of a two-dimensional granular slab to an external load, revealing that both approaches are valid - albeit on different length scales. For small systems that can be considered mesoscopic on the scale of the grains, a hyperbolic-like, strongly anisotropic response is expected. However, in large systems ( those typically considered by engineers), the response is closer to that predicted by traditional isotropic elasticity models. Static friction, often ignored in simple models, plays a key role: it increases the elastic range and renders the response more isotropic, even beyond this range.","Tel Aviv Univ, Fac Engn, Dept Fluid Mech & Heat Transfer, IL-69978 Tel Aviv, Israel; Tel Aviv Univ, Raymond & Beverly Sackler Fac Exact Sci, Sch Phys & Astron, IL-69978 Tel Aviv, Israel","Goldhirsch, I (reprint author), Tel Aviv Univ, Fac Engn, Dept Fluid Mech & Heat Transfer, IL-69978 Tel Aviv, Israel.",isaac@eng.tau.ac.il,,,,,,27,131,137,7,56,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,12-May,2005,435,7039,,,,,188,191,,10.1038/nature03497,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,924ZO,WOS:000229021100035,15889087,No,,,11/20/17

The molecular structures and design principles responsible for this nonlinear elasticity are unknown. Here we report a molecular theory that accounts for strain-stiffening in a range of molecularly distinct gels formed from cytoskeletal and extracellular proteins and that reveals universal stress - strain relations at low to intermediate strains. The input to this theory is the force - extension curve for individual semi-flexible filaments and the assumptions that biological networks composed of these filaments are homogeneous, isotropic, and that they strain uniformly.

The main phases occurred during the Late Cretaceous and Middle Palaeocene, and have been previously explained by pulses of compression, mainly from the Alpine orogen(2-5). Here we show that the main phases differed both in structural style and cause. The Cretaceous phase was characterized by narrow uplift zones, reverse activation of faults, crustal shortening, and the formation of asymmetric marginal troughs. In contrast, the Middle Palaeocene phase was characterized by dome-like uplift of a wider area with only mild fault movements, and formation of more distal and shallow marginal troughs. A simple flexural model explains how domal, secondary inversion follows inevitably from primary, convergence-related inversion on relaxation of the in-plane tectonic stress. The onset of relaxation inversions was plate-wide and simultaneous, and may have been triggered by stress changes caused by elevation of the North Atlantic lithosphere by the Iceland plume(6) or the drop in the north - south convergence rate between Africa and Europe(7).","Univ Aarhus, Dept Earth Sci, DK-8200 Aarhus, Denmark","Nielsen, SB (reprint author), Univ Aarhus, Dept Earth Sci, Finlandsgade 8, DK-8200 Aarhus, Denmark.",sbn@geo.au.dk,"Thomsen, Erik/A-4842-2012; Clausen, Ole Rono/A-5290-2012; Nielsen, Soren/A-5288-2012; Egholm, David/G-8227-2011","Egholm, David Lundbek/0000-0003-4045-240X; Clausen, Ole Rono/0000-0002-6825-9065",,,,31,45,45,1,11,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,12-May,2005,435,7039,,,,,195,198,,10.1038/nature03599,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,924ZO,WOS:000229021100037,15889089,No,,,11/20/17

The reduced fields are commonly attributed to pressure demagnetization caused by shock waves generated during meteorite impact(2,3), in the absence of a significant ambient magnetic field. Lower than average magnetic field intensities are also observed above the Vredefort meteorite crater in South Africa, yet here we show that the rocks in this crater possess much higher magnetic intensities than equivalent lithologies found elsewhere on Earth. We find that palaeomagnetic directions of these strongly magnetized rocks are randomly oriented, with vector directions changing over centimetre length scales. Moreover, the magnetite grains contributing to the magnetic remanence crystallized during impact, which directly relates the randomization and intensification to the impact event. The strong and randomly oriented magnetization vectors effectively cancel out when summed over the whole crater. Seen from high altitudes, as for martian craters, the magnetic field appears much lower than that of neighbouring terranes, implying that magnetic anomalies of meteorite craters cannot be used as evidence for the absence of the planet's internally generated magnetic field at the time of impact.","Inst Phys Globe, Lab Paleomagnetisme, F-75252 Paris, France; Univ Witwatersrand, Schonland Res Ctr, ZA-2050 Wits, Johannesburg, South Africa","Gilder, SA (reprint author), Inst Phys Globe, Lab Paleomagnetisme, 4 Pl Jussieu, F-75252 Paris, France.",gilder@ipgp.jussieu.fr,"Gilder, Stuart/B-1871-2016","Gilder, Stuart/0000-0001-8724-7812",,,,24,46,46,0,12,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,12-May,2005,435,7039,,,,,198,201,,10.1038/nature03560,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,924ZO,WOS:000229021100038,15889090,No,,,11/20/17

Two of the eyes on each rhopalium have long been known to resemble eyes of higher animals, but the function and performance of these eyes have remained unknown(4). Here we show that box-jellyfish lenses contain a finely tuned refractive index gradient producing nearly aberration-free imaging. This demonstrates that even simple animals have been able to evolve the sophisticated visual optics previously known only from a few advanced bilaterian phyla. However, the position of the retina does not coincide with the sharp image, leading to very wide and complex receptive fields in individual photoreceptors. We argue that this may be useful in eyes serving a single visual task. The findings indicate that tailoring of complex receptive fields might have been one of the original driving forces in the evolution of animal lenses.","Lund Univ, Dept Cell & Organism Biol, S-22362 Lund, Sweden; Lund Univ, Dept Theoret Phys, SE-22362 Lund, Sweden","Nilsson, DE (reprint author), Lund Univ, Dept Cell & Organism Biol, Zool Bldg,Helgonavagen 3, S-22362 Lund, Sweden.",dan-e.nilsson@cob.lu.se,"Garm, Anders /K-4362-2014","Garm, Anders /0000-0002-2080-735X",,,,24,110,114,6,67,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,12-May,2005,435,7039,,,,,201,205,,10.1038/nature03484,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,924ZO,WOS:000229021100039,15889091,No,,,11/20/17

Current models of human dynamics, used from risk assessment to communications, assume that human actions are randomly distributed in time and thus well approximated by Poisson processes(1-3). In contrast, there is increasing evidence that the timing of many human activities, ranging from communication to entertainment and work patterns, follow non-Poisson statistics, characterized by bursts of rapidly occurring events separated by long periods of inactivity(4-8). Here I show that the bursty nature of human behaviour is a consequence of a decision-based queuing process(9,10): when individuals execute tasks based on some perceived priority, the timing of the tasks will be heavy tailed, with most tasks being rapidly executed, whereas a few experience very long waiting times. In contrast, random or priority blind execution is well approximated by uniform inter-event statistics.

At any instant, only about 100 vesicles are tethered to the synaptic ribbon, and about 14 of these are docked to the plasma membrane(1,2), constituting the readily releasable pool(3). Although this pool contains about the same number of vesicles as that of conventional synapses(4,5), ribbon release sites operate at rates of about two orders of magnitude higher(3,6,7) and with submillisecond precision(8-11). How these sites replenish their vesicles so efficiently remains unclear(3,12,13). We show here, using two-photon imaging of single release sites in the intact cochlea, that preformed vesicles derived from cytoplasmic vesicle-generating compartments(14) participate in fast release and replenishment. Vesicles were released at a maximal initial rate of 3 per millisecond during a depolarizing pulse, and were replenished at a rate of 1.9 per millisecond. We propose that such rapid resupply of vesicles enables temporally precise and sustained release rates. This may explain how the first auditory synapse can encode with indefatigable precision without having to rely on the slow, local endocytic vesicle cycle(7).","UCL, Dept Physiol, London WC1E 6BT, England; UCL, UCL Ear Inst, London WC1E 6BT, England; Univ Freiburg, Inst Physiol 2, D-79104 Freiburg, Germany","Griesinger, CB (reprint author), UCL, Dept Physiol, Gower St, London WC1E 6BT, England.",claudius.griesinger@physiologie.uni-freiburg.de; j.ashmore@ucl.ac.uk,,,,,,30,81,83,1,10,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,12-May,2005,435,7039,,,,,212,215,,10.1038/nature03567,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,924ZO,WOS:000229021100042,15829919,No,,,11/20/17

This defect is linked to a loss of coordination of the segmentation clock oscillations(1). The lateralization of this defect led us to investigate the relation between somitogenesis and the left - right asymmetry machinery(2,3) in RA-deficient embryos. Reversal of the situs in chick(4,5) or mouse(6) embryos lacking RA results in a reversal of the somitogenesis laterality defect. Our data indicate that RA is important in buffering the lateralizing influence of the left - right machinery, thus permitting synchronization of the development of the two embryonic sides.","Stowers Inst Med Res, Kansas City, MO 64110 USA","Pourquie, O (reprint author), Stowers Inst Med Res, 1000E 50th St, Kansas City, MO 64110 USA.",olp@stowers-institute.org,"Vermot, Julien/I-6568-2016","Pourquie, Olivier/0000-0001-5189-1227; , Julien/0000-0002-8924-732X",,,,29,147,155,2,16,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,12-May,2005,435,7039,,,,,215,220,,10.1038/nature03488,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,924ZO,WOS:000229021100043,15889094,No,,,11/20/17

For type 1 diabetes it is clear that multiple islet molecules are the target of autoimmunity in man and animal models(1,2). It is not clear whether any of the target molecules are essential for the destruction of islet beta cells. Here we show that the proinsulin/ insulin molecules have a sequence that is a primary target of the autoimmunity that causes diabetes of the non-obese diabetic ( NOD) mouse. We created insulin 1 and insulin 2 gene knockouts combined with a mutated proinsulin transgene ( in which residue 16 on the B chain was changed to alanine) in NOD mice. This mutation abrogated the T-cell stimulation of a series of the major insulin autoreactive NOD T-cell clones(3). Female mice with only the altered insulin did not develop insulin autoantibodies, insulitis or autoimmune diabetes, in contrast with mice containing at least one copy of the native insulin gene. We suggest that proinsulin is a primary autoantigen of the NOD mouse, and speculate that organ-restricted autoimmune disorders with marked major histocompatibility complex (MHC) restriction of disease are likely to have specific primary autoantigens.","Univ Colorado, Hlth Sci Ctr, Barbara Davis Ctr Childhood Diabet, Denver, CO 80262 USA; Nagasaki Univ, Grad Sch Biomed Sci, Nagasaki 8528501, Japan; Kobe Univ, Grad Sch Med, Kobe, Hyogo 6500017, Japan; Univ Alberta, Edmonton, AB T6G 2S2, Canada","Eisenbarth, GS (reprint author), Univ Colorado, Hlth Sci Ctr, Barbara Davis Ctr Childhood Diabet, Denver, CO 80262 USA.",george.eisenbarth@uchsc.edu,,,"NIAID NIH HHS [R01 AI039213, U19 AI050864]; NIDDK NIH HHS [R01 DK032083, R01 DK055969, R01 DK062718]",,,28,435,450,0,15,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,12-May,2005,435,7039,,,,,220,223,,10.1038/nature03523,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,924ZO,WOS:000229021100044,15889095,No,,,11/20/17

These networks can prevent the reversion of established phenotypes even in the presence of significant fluctuations. Here we explore the key parameters that determine the stability of cellular memory by using the yeast galactose-signalling network as a model system. This network contains multiple nested feedback loops. Of the two positive feedback loops, only the loop mediated by the cytoplasmic signal transducer Gal3p is able to generate two stable expression states with a persistent memory of previous galactose consumption states. The parallel loop mediated by the galactose transporter Gal2p only increases the expression difference between the two states. A negative feedback through the inhibitor Gal80p reduces the strength of the core positive feedback. Despite this, a constitutive increase in the Gal80p concentration tunes the system from having destabilized memory to having persistent memory. A model reveals that fluctuations are trapped more efficiently at higher Gal80p concentrations. Indeed, the rate at which single cells randomly switch back and forth between expression states was reduced. These observations provide a quantitative understanding of the stability and reversibility of cellular differentiation states.","MIT, Dept Phys, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA","van Oudenaarden, A (reprint author), MIT, Dept Phys, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",avano@mit.edu,,"Becskei, Attila/0000-0002-9462-0934",,,,30,301,309,2,31,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,12-May,2005,435,7039,,,,,228,232,,10.1038/nature03524,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,924ZO,WOS:000229021100046,15889097,No,,,11/20/17

There are many genes for polyketide synthases and ABC transporters, suggesting an extensive secondary metabolism for producing and exporting small molecules. The genome is rich in complex repeats, one class of which is clustered and may serve as centromeres. Partial copies of the extrachromosomal ribosomal DNA ( rDNA) element are found at the ends of each chromosome, suggesting a novel telomere structure and the use of a common mechanism to maintain both the rDNA and chromosomal termini. A proteome-based phylogeny shows that the amoebozoa diverged from the animal - fungal lineage after the plant - animal split, but Dictyostelium seems to have retained more of the diversity of the ancestral genome than have plants, animals or fungi.","MRC Ctr, Mol Biol Lab, Cambridge CB2 2QH, England; Univ Cologne, Ctr Biochem, D-50931 Cologne, Germany; Univ Cologne, Ctr Mol Med Cologne, D-50931 Cologne, Germany; Inst Mol Biotechnol, D-07745 Jena, Germany; Wellcome Trust Sanger Inst, Hinxton CB10 1SA, Cambs, England; Baylor Coll Med, Verna & Marrs McLean Dept Biochem & Mol Biol, Houston, TX 77030 USA; Baylor Coll Med, Dept Mol & Human Genet, Houston, TX 77030 USA; Baylor Coll Med, Grad Program Struct & Computat Biol & Mol Biophys, Houston, TX 77030 USA; Baylor Coll Med, Human Genome Sequencing Ctr, Houston, TX 77030 USA; Univ Calif San Diego, Div Biol, Sect Cell & Dev Biol, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; Northwestern Univ, Ctr Med Genet, DictyBase, Chicago, IL 60611 USA; Univ Tsukuba, Grad Sch Life & Environm Sci, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058572, Japan; Univ Munich, Adolf Butenandt Inst Cell Biol, D-80336 Munich, Germany; Univ Cambridge, Dept Biochem, Cambridge CB2 1QW, England; Hokkaido Univ, Grad Sch Sci, Div Biol Sci, Sapporo, Hokkaido 0600810, Japan; Inst Pasteur, Unite Genom Microorganismes Pathogenes, F-75724 Paris, France; Univ York, Dept Biol, York YO10 5YW, N Yorkshire, England; MRC Res Ctr, MRC Canc Cell Unit, Cambridge CB2 2XZ, England; Natl Inst Genet, Ctr Genet Resource Informat, Shizuoka 4118540, Japan; Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Frontier Sci, Dept Med Genome Sci, Minato Ku, Tokyo 1088639, Japan; Goethe Univ Frankfurt, Biozentrum, Inst Pharmazeut Biol, D-60439 Frankfurt, Germany; Princeton Univ, Dept Mol Biol, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; Univ Dundee, Sch Life Sci, Dundee DD1 5EH, Scotland","Dear, PH (reprint author), MRC Ctr, Mol Biol Lab, Cambridge CB2 2QH, England.",phd@mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk,"Chisholm, Rex/B-3418-2009; Dear, Paul/A-1162-2012; Hall, Neil/A-8717-2013; Lu, Mingyang/F-6865-2013; Glockner, Gernot/A-7800-2010; Mourier, Tobias/C-1164-2015; Pain, Arnab/L-5766-2015; Fey, Petra/O-5977-2015","Chisholm, Rex/0000-0002-5638-3990; Hall, Neil/0000-0002-7995-3810; Glockner, Gernot/0000-0002-9061-1061; Mourier, Tobias/0000-0003-2727-1903; Pain, Arnab/0000-0002-1755-2819; Fey, Petra/0000-0002-4532-2703; Kerhornou, Arnaud/0000-0002-2890-295X; Davis, Paul/0000-0001-5545-0824; Kuspa, Adam/0000-0002-9156-149X; Shaulsky, Gad/0000-0002-0532-0551; Anjard, Christophe/0000-0002-6905-1493; Goodhead, Ian/0000-0002-3110-9442; Hall, Neil/0000-0003-2808-0009; MORIO, Takahiro/0000-0002-4007-881X; Kay, Robert R/0000-0001-9836-7967; Buchrieser, Carmen/0000-0003-3477-9190",NICHD NIH HHS [R01 HD035925],,,98,759,4866,20,185,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,5-May,2005,435,7038,,,,,43,57,,10.1038/nature03481,,15,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,922UL,WOS:000228864600034,15875012,No,,,11/20/17

Phoebe's generally dark surface shows evidence of water ice(1), but otherwise the surface most closely resembles that of C-type asteroids(2) and small outer Solar System bodies such as Chiron and Pholus that are thought to have originated in the Kuiper belt(3). A close fly-by of Phoebe by the Cassini-Huygens spacecraft on 11 June 2004 ( 19 days before the spacecraft entered orbit around Saturn) provided an opportunity to test the hypothesis that this moon did not form in situ during Saturn's formation, but is instead a product of the larger protoplanetary disk or 'solar nebula'.

One possibility is to use electron spin to store, manipulate and carry information(2). All such 'spintronics' applications are faced with formidable challenges in finding fast and efficient ways to create, transport, detect, control and manipulate spin textures and currents. Here we show how most of these operations can be performed in a relatively simple manner in a hybrid system consisting of a superconducting film and a paramagnetic diluted magnetic semiconductor (DMS) quantum well. Our proposal is based on the observation that the inhomogeneous magnetic fields of the superconducting film create local spin and charge textures in the DMS quantum well, leading to a variety of effects such as Bloch oscillations and an unusual quantum Hall effect. We exploit recent progress in manipulating magnetic flux bundles ( vortices) in superconductors(3,4) and show how these can create, manipulate and control the spin textures in DMSs.","Univ Notre Dame, Dept Phys, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA; Univ British Columbia, Dept Phys & Astron, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z1, Canada; Argonne Natl Lab, Div Mat Sci, Argonne, IL 60439 USA","Janko, B (reprint author), Univ Notre Dame, Dept Phys, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA.",bjanko@nd.edu,"Rappoport, Tatiana/J-8626-2014; Berciu, Mona/O-4889-2014","Rappoport, Tatiana/0000-0002-1878-5956",,,,25,57,58,3,20,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,5-May,2005,435,7038,,,,,71,75,,10.1038/nature03559,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,922UL,WOS:000228864600038,15875016,No,,,11/20/17

Detailed experimental information is therefore necessary to understand both the network properties and the fundamentals of glass formation. Here we address the problem by investigating topological and chemical ordering in structurally disordered AX(2) systems by applying the method of isotopic substitution in neutron diffraction to glassy ZnCl2. This system may be regarded as a prototypical ionic network forming glass, provided that ion polarization effects are taken into account(7), and has thus been the focus of much attention(8-14). By experiment, we show that both the topological and chemical ordering are described by two length scales at distances greater than nearest-neighbour length scales. One of these is associated with the intermediate range, as manifested by the appearance in the measured diffraction patterns of a first sharp diffraction peak at 1.09( 3) angstrom(-1); the other is associated with an extended range, which shows ordering in the glass out to 62( 4) angstrom. We also find that these general features are characteristic of glassy GeSe2, a prototypical covalently bonded network material(15,16). The results therefore offer structural insight into those length scales that determine many important aspects of supercooled liquid and glass phenomenology(11).","Univ Bath, Dept Phys, Bath BA2 7AY, Avon, England; Univ Bristol, HH Wills Phys Lab, Bristol BS8 1TL, Avon, England; Inst Max Von Laue Paul Langevin, F-38042 Grenoble, France","Salmon, PS (reprint author), Univ Bath, Dept Phys, Bath BA2 7AY, Avon, England.",p.s.salmon@bath.ac.uk,"Cuello, Gabriel/C-5831-2009; Salmon, Philip/Q-9512-2016","Cuello, Gabriel/0000-0003-3844-0602; Salmon, Philip/0000-0001-8671-1011; Martin, Richard/0000-0002-6013-2334",,,,30,141,142,2,39,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,5-May,2005,435,7038,,,,,75,78,,10.1038/nature03475,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,922UL,WOS:000228864600039,15875017,No,,,11/20/17

The cause of this synchronous acceleration of fault slip and the subsequent clustering of earthquakes during the Holocene(3) has remained enigmatic, although it has been suggested that the coincidence between the acceleration of slip and the shrinkage of Lake Bonneville after the Last Glacial Maximum may indicate a causal relationship(4). Here we use finite-element models of a discrete normal fault within a rheologically layered lithosphere to evaluate the relative importance of two competing processes that affect fault slip: postglacial unloading ( the removal of mass), which decreases the slip rate, and lithospheric rebound, which promotes faster slip. We show that lithospheric rebound caused by regression of Lake Bonneville(4-6) and deglaciation of adjacent mountain ranges(7,8) provides a feasible mechanism for the high Holocene rates of faulting in the Wasatch region. Our analysis implies that climate-controlled changes in loads applied to Earth's surface may exert a fundamental control on the slip history of individual normal faults.","ETH, Inst Geol, Dept Earth Sci, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland; Univ Bern, Inst Geol Sci, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland","Hetzel, R (reprint author), Univ Munster, Inst Geol Palaontol, Corrensstr 24, D-48149 Munster, Germany.",rahetzel@uni-muenster.de,,,,,,30,77,77,1,16,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,5-May,2005,435,7038,,,,,81,84,,10.1038/nature03562,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,922UL,WOS:000228864600041,15875019,No,,,11/20/17

Although more than a dozen therizinosauroid taxa are known, their relationships within Dinosauria have remained controversial because of fragmentary remains and an unusual suite of characters. The recently discovered 'feathered' therizinosauroid Beipiaosaurus from the Early Cretaceous of China helped to clarify the theropod affinities of the group(3). However, Beipiaosaurus is also poorly represented. Here we describe a new, primitive therizinosauroid from an extensive paucispecific bonebed at the base of the Cedar Mountain Formation ( Early Cretaceous) of east-central Utah(4,5). This new taxon represents the most complete and most basal therizinosauroid yet discovered. Phylogenetic analysis of coelurosaurian theropods incorporating this taxon places it at the base of the clade Therizinosauroiden, indicating that this species documents the earliest known stage in the poorly understood transition from carnivory to herbivory within Therizinosauroidea. The taxon provides the first documentation, to our knowledge, of therizinosauroids in North America during the Early Cretaceous.","Utah Geol Survey, Salt Lake City, UT 84114 USA; Univ Utah, Utah Museum Nat Hist, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA; Univ Utah, Dept Geol & Geophys, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA; George Washington Univ, Washington, DC 20052 USA","Kirkland, JI (reprint author), Utah Geol Survey, POB 146100, Salt Lake City, UT 84114 USA.",jameskirkland@utah.gov,,,,,,28,59,62,0,10,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,5-May,2005,435,7038,,,,,84,87,,10.1038/nature03468,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,922UL,WOS:000228864600042,15875020,No,,,11/20/17

The new salamander differs osteologically from putative relatives, especially with respect to the tongue ( attached protrusible) and the derived tarsus(2-6). We place the species in a new genus on the basis of the morphological and molecular data.

This has been explained by the wealth of ecological opportunity in large lakes compared with rivers. It is therefore surprising that the rivers of southern Africa harbour many, ecologically diverse haplochromines. Here we present genetic, morphological and biogeographical evidence suggesting that these riverine cichlids are products of a recent adaptive radiation in a large lake that dried up in the Holocene. Haplochromine species richness peaks steeply in an area for which geological data reveal the historical existence of Lake palaeo-Makgadikgadi(2,3). The centre of this extinct lake is now a saltpan north of the Kalahari Desert, but it once hosted a rapidly evolving fish species radiation, comparable in morphological diversity to that in the extant African Great Lakes. Importantly, this lake seeded all major river systems of southern Africa with ecologically diverse cichlids.
