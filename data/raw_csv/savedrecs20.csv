Although progress has been made in identifying major quantitative trait loci (QTL), experimental constraints have limited our knowledge of small-effect QTL, which may be responsible for a large proportion of trait variation(1-3). Here, we identified and dissected a one-centimorgan chromosome interval in Arabidopsis thaliana without regard to its effect on growth rate, and examined the signature of historical sequence polymorphism among Arabidopsis accessions. We found that the interval contained two growth rate QTL within 210 kilobases. Both QTL showed epistasis; that is, their phenotypic effects depended on the genetic background. This amount of complexity in such a small area suggests a highly polygenic architecture of quantitative variation, much more than previously documented(4). One QTL was limited to a single gene. The gene in question displayed a nucleotide signature indicative of balancing selection, and its phenotypic effects are reversed depending on genetic background. If this region typifies many complex trait loci, then non-neutral epistatic polymorphism may be an important contributor to genetic variation in complex traits.","Max Planck Inst Chem Ecol, Dept Genet & Evolut, D-07745 Jena, Germany","Kroymann, J (reprint author), Max Planck Inst Chem Ecol, Dept Genet & Evolut, Hans Knoell Str 8, D-07745 Jena, Germany.",kroymann@ice.mpg.de,"Mitchell-Olds, Thomas/K-8121-2012; Kroymann, Juergen/B-4317-2013","Mitchell-Olds, Thomas/0000-0003-3439-9921; Kroymann, Juergen/0000-0002-4573-6498",,,,22,184,192,0,19,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,5-May,2005,435,7038,,,,,95,98,,10.1038/nature03480,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,922UL,WOS:000228864600045,15875023,No,,,11/20/17

The current model of arterial - venous identity proposes that binding of vascular endothelial growth factor to its heterodimeric receptor - Flk1 and neuropilin 1 (NP-1; also called Nrp1) - activates the Notch signalling pathway in the endothelium, causing induction of ephrin B2 expression and suppression of ephrin receptor B4 expression to establish arterial identity(1-4). Little is known about vein identity except that it involves ephrin receptor B4 expression, because Notch signalling is not activated in veins; an unresolved question is how vein identity is regulated. Here, we show that COUP-TFII ( also known as Nr2f2), a member of the orphan nuclear receptor superfamily, is specifically expressed in venous but not arterial endothelium. Ablation of COUP-TFII in endothelial cells enables veins to acquire arterial characteristics, including the expression of arterial markers NP-1 and Notch signalling molecules, and the generation of haematopoietic cell clusters. Furthermore, ectopic expression of COUP-TFII in endothelial cells results in the fusion of veins and arteries in transgenic mouse embryos. Thus, COUP-TFII has a critical role in repressing Notch signalling to maintain vein identity, which suggests that vein identity is under genetic control and is not derived by a default pathway.","Baylor Coll Med, Dept Mol & Cellular Biol, Houston, TX 77030 USA; Baylor Coll Med, Dev Biol Program, Houston, TX 77030 USA","Tsai, MJ (reprint author), Baylor Coll Med, Dept Mol & Cellular Biol, Houston, TX 77030 USA.",mtsai@bcm.tmc.edu; stsai@bcm.tmc.edu,,"LIN, FU-JUNG/0000-0003-4065-0983",,,,27,319,329,1,9,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,5-May,2005,435,7038,,,,,98,104,,10.1038/nature03511,,7,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,922UL,WOS:000228864600046,15875024,No,,,11/20/17

Low implantation rate is a major problem during infertility treatments using assisted reproductive technologies(1). Here we report a newly discovered molecular influence on implantation through the lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) receptor LPA(3) (refs 2 - 4). Targeted deletion of LPA(3) in mice resulted in significantly reduced litter size, which could be attributed to delayed implantation and altered embryo spacing. These two events led to delayed embryonic development, hypertrophic placentas shared by multiple embryos and embryonic death. An enzyme demonstrated to influence implantation, cyclooxygenase 2 (COX2) (ref. 5), was downregulated in LPA(3)-deficient uteri during preimplantation. Downregulation of COX2 led to reduced levels of prostaglandins E-2 and I-2 (PGE(2) and PGI(2)), which are critical for implantation(1). Exogenous administration of PGE(2) or carbaprostacyclin ( a stable analogue of PGI(2)) into LPA(3)-deficient female mice rescued delayed implantation but did not rescue defects in embryo spacing. These data identify LPA(3) receptor-mediated signalling as having an influence on implantation, and further indicate linkage between LPA signalling and prostaglandin biosynthesis.","Scripps Res Inst, Dept Mol Biol, Helen L Dorris Child & Adolescent Neuropsychiat D, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Pharmaceut Sci, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo 1130033, Japan; Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Med, Dept Dev Med Technol Sankyo, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo 1130033, Japan; Fred Hutchinson Canc Res Ctr, Seattle, WA 98109 USA; Washington State Univ, Sch Mol Biosci, Ctr Reprod Biol, Pullman, WA 99164 USA; Obihiro Univ Agr & Vet Med, Natl Res Ctr Protozoan Dis, Obihiro, Hokkaido 0808555, Japan","Chun, J (reprint author), Scripps Res Inst, Dept Mol Biol, Helen L Dorris Child & Adolescent Neuropsychiat D, 10550 N Torrey Pines Rd, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA.",jchun@scripps.edu,,"Aoki, Junken/0000-0001-9435-1896",NIMH NIH HHS [K02 MH001723],,,30,307,326,0,14,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,5-May,2005,435,7038,,,,,104,108,,10.1038/nature03505,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,922UL,WOS:000228864600047,15875025,No,,,11/20/17

Whether the inability of HIV to infect these resting CD4(+) T cells is due to the lack of a key factor, or alternatively reflects the presence of an efficient mechanism for defence against HIV, is not clear. Here we show that the anti-retroviral deoxycytidine deaminase APOBEC3G(5) strongly protects unstimulated peripheral blood CD4(+) T cells against HIV-1 infection. In activated CD4(+) T cells, cytoplasmic APOBEC3G resides in an enzymatically inactive, high-molecular-mass (HMM) ribonucleoprotein complex that converts to an enzymatically active low-molecular-mass (LMM) form after treatment with RNase. In contrast, LMM APOBEC3G predominates in unstimulated CD4(+) T cells, where HIV-1 replication is blocked and reverse transcription is impaired(1-3). Mitogen activation induces the recruitment of LMM APOBEC3G into the HMM complex, and this correlates with a sharp increase in permissivity for HIV infection in these stimulated cells. Notably, when APOBEC3G-specific small interfering RNAs are introduced into unstimulated CD4(+) T cells, the early replication block encountered by HIV-1 is greatly relieved. Thus, LMM APOBEC3G functions as a potent post-entry restriction factor for HIV-1 in unstimulated CD4(+) T cells. Surprisingly, sequencing of the reverse transcripts slowly formed in unstimulated CD4(+) T cells reveals only low levels of dG --> dA hypermutation, raising the possibility that the APOBEC3G-restricting activity may not be strictly dependent on deoxycytidine deamination.","Univ Calif San Francisco, Gladstone Inst Virol & Immunol, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Med, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Microbiol, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Immunol, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA","Greene, WC (reprint author), Univ Calif San Francisco, Gladstone Inst Virol & Immunol, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA.",wgreene@gladstone.ucsf.edu,,,,,,30,353,365,0,13,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,5-May,2005,435,7038,,,,,108,114,,10.1038/nature03493,,7,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,922UL,WOS:000228864600048,15829920,No,,,11/20/17

The bipolar organization of spindles is essential for proper segregation of chromosomes, and requires plus-end-directed homotetrameric motor proteins of the widely conserved kinesin-5 ( BimC) family(3). Hypotheses for bipolar spindle formation include the 'push-pull mitotic muscle' model, in which kinesin-5 and opposing motor proteins act between overlapping microtubules(2,4,5). However, the precise roles of kinesin-5 during this process are unknown. Here we show that the vertebrate kinesin-5 Eg5 drives the sliding of microtubules depending on their relative orientation. We found in controlled in vitro assays that Eg5 has the remarkable capability of simultaneously moving at similar to 20 nm s(-1) towards the plus-ends of each of the two microtubules it crosslinks. For anti-parallel microtubules, this results in relative sliding at similar to 40 nm s(-1), comparable to spindle pole separation rates in vivo(6). Furthermore, we found that Eg5 can tether microtubule plus-ends, suggesting an additional microtubule-binding mode for Eg5. Our results demonstrate how members of the kinesin-5 family are likely to function in mitosis, pushing apart interpolar microtubules as well as recruiting microtubules into bundles that are subsequently polarized by relative sliding.","Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Dept Phys & Astron, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands; Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Ctr Laser, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands; Rockefeller Univ, Lab Chem & Cell Biol, New York, NY 10021 USA","Peterman, EJG (reprint author), Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Dept Phys & Astron, Boelelaan 1081, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands.",erwinp@nat.vu.nl; kapoor@mail.rockefeller.edu,"Schmidt, Christoph/G-3787-2011; Peterman, Erwin/G-5529-2010; Kapitein, Lukas/J-4776-2016","Schmidt, Christoph/0000-0003-2864-6973; Peterman, Erwin/0000-0003-1058-249X; Kapitein, Lukas/0000-0001-9418-6739",,,,27,328,337,1,34,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,5-May,2005,435,7038,,,,,114,118,,10.1038/nature03503,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,922UL,WOS:000228864600049,15875026,No,,,11/20/17

Such oscillators are useful in testing the design principles and in exploring potential applications not limited by natural cellular behaviour(15). To achieve transcriptional and metabolic integration characteristic of natural oscillators, here we designed and constructed a synthetic circuit in Escherichia coli K12, using glycolytic flux to generate oscillation through the signalling metabolite acetyl phosphate. If two metabolite pools are interconverted by two enzymes that are placed under the transcriptional control of acetyl phosphate, the system oscillates when the glycolytic rate exceeds a critical value. We used bifurcation analysis to identify the boundaries of oscillation, and verified these experimentally. This work demonstrates the possibility of using metabolic flux as a control factor in system-wide oscillation, as well as the predictability of a de novo gene - metabolic circuit designed using nonlinear dynamic analysis.","Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Chem Engn, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; Univ Calif Los Angeles, Biomed Engn Interdepartmental Program, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA","Liao, JC (reprint author), Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Chem Engn, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.",liaoj@ucla.edu,"Hsing-Yen, Su/G-9552-2014","Bulter, Thomas/0000-0002-7968-5844",,,,29,242,253,2,33,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,5-May,2005,435,7038,,,,,118,122,,10.1038/nature03508,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,922UL,WOS:000228864600050,15875027,No,,,11/20/17

Determining which genes underlie this phenotype could shed light on the mechanisms and functions of sleep. To do so, we performed mutagenesis in Drosophila melanogaster, because flies also sleep for many hours and, when sleep deprived, show sleep rebound and performance impairments. By screening 9,000 mutant lines, we found minisleep (mns), a line that sleeps for one-third of the wild-type amount. We show that mns flies perform normally in a number of tasks, have preserved sleep homeostasis, but are not impaired by sleep deprivation. We then show that mns flies carry a point mutation in a conserved domain of the Shaker gene. Moreover, after crossing out genetic modifiers accumulated over many generations, other Shaker alleles also become short sleepers and fail to complement the mns phenotype. Finally, we show that short-sleeping Shaker flies have a reduced lifespan. Shaker, which encodes a voltage-dependent potassium channel controlling membrane repolarization and transmitter release, may thus regulate sleep need or efficiency.","Univ Wisconsin, Dept Psychiat, Madison, WI 53719 USA; Univ Wisconsin, Genet Lab, Madison, WI 53706 USA","Tononi, G (reprint author), Univ Wisconsin, Dept Psychiat, 6001 Res Pk Blvd, Madison, WI 53719 USA.",gtononi@wisc.edu,"Tononi, Giulio/B-8387-2009","Hill, Sean/0000-0001-8055-860X",,,,50,216,226,2,24,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,28-Apr,2005,434,7037,,,,,1087,1092,,10.1038/nature03486,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,920MD,WOS:000228693300032,15858564,No,,,11/20/17

The mechanism underlying this depletion of memory CD4(+) T cells (that is, T-helper cells specific to previously encountered pathogens) has not been defined. Using highly sensitive, quantitative polymerase chain reaction together with precise sorting of different subsets of CD4(+) T cells in various tissues, we show that this loss is explained by a massive infection of memory CD4(+) T cells by the virus. Specifically, 30-60% of CD4(+) memory T cells throughout the body are infected by SIV at the peak of infection, and most of these infected cells disappear within four days. Furthermore, our data demonstrate that the depletion of memory CD4(+) T cells occurs to a similar extent in all tissues. As a consequence, over one-half of all memory CD4(+) T cells in SIV-infected macaques are destroyed directly by viral infection during the acute phase-an insult that certainly heralds subsequent immunodeficiency.

The energy release probably occurred during a catastrophic reconfiguration of the neutron star's magnetic field.

On 27 December 2004, a giant flare(4) with a fluence(5) exceeding 0.3 erg cm(-2) was detected from SGR 1806-20. Here we report the detection of a fading radio counterpart to this event. We began a monitoring programme from 0.2 to 250 GHz and obtained a high-resolution 21-cm radio spectrum that traces the intervening interstellar neutral hydrogen clouds. Analysis of the spectrum yields the first direct distance measurement of SGR 1806-20: the source is located at a distance greater than 6.4 kpc and we argue that it is nearer than 9.8 kpc. If correct, our distance estimate lowers the total energy of the explosion and relaxes the demands on theoretical models. The energetics and the rapid decay of the radio source are not compatible with the afterglow model that is usually invoked for gamma-ray bursts.

However, attempts to produce fusion in a room temperature solid-state setting, including 'cold' fusion(5) and 'bubble' fusion(6), have met with deep scepticism(7). Here we report that gently heating a pyroelectric crystal in a deuterated atmosphere can generate fusion under desktop conditions. The electrostatic field of the crystal is used to generate and accelerate a deuteron beam (>100 keV and >4 nA), which, upon striking a deuterated target, produces a neutron flux over 400 times the background level. The presence of neutrons from the reaction D + D -> He-3 (820 keV) + n (2.45 MeV) within the target is confirmed by pulse shape analysis and proton recoil spectroscopy. As further evidence for this fusion reaction, we use a novel time-of-flight technique to demonstrate the delayed coincidence between the outgoing alpha-particle and the neutron. Although the reported fusion is not useful in the power-producing sense, we anticipate that the system will find application as a simple palm-sized neutron generator.","Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Phys, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Chem, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; Univ Calif Los Angeles, CNSI, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA","Naranjo, B (reprint author), Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Phys, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.",naranjo@physics.ucla.edu,,,,,,21,121,122,1,65,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,28-Apr,2005,434,7037,,,,,1115,1117,,10.1038/nature03575,,3,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,920MD,WOS:000228693300039,15858570,No,,,11/20/17

There is widespread evidence for Heinrich events and their profound impact on the climate and circulation of the North Atlantic Ocean, but their influence beyond that region remains uncertain(1). Here we use a combination of molecular fingerprints of algal productivity and radioisotope tracers of sedimentation to document eight periods of increased productivity in the subpolar Southern Ocean during the past 70,000 years that occurred within 1,000-2,000 years of a Northern Hemisphere Heinrich event. We discuss possible causes for such a link, including increased supply of iron from upwelling and increased stratification during the growing season, which imply an alteration of the global ocean circulation during Heinrich events. The mechanisms linking North Atlantic iceberg discharges with subantarctic productivity remain unclear at this point. We suggest that understanding how the Southern Ocean was altered during these extreme climate perturbations is critical to understanding the role of the ocean in climate change.","MIT, Dept Earth Atmospher & Planetary Sci, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; Columbia Univ, Lamont Doherty Earth Observ, Palisades, NY 10964 USA","Sachs, JP (reprint author), MIT, Dept Earth Atmospher & Planetary Sci, 77 Massachusetts Ave,Room E34-254, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",jsachs@mit.edu,,"Anderson, Robert/0000-0002-8472-2494",,,,30,73,75,0,29,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,28-Apr,2005,434,7037,,,,,1118,1121,,10.1038/nature03544,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,920MD,WOS:000228693300040,15858571,No,,,11/20/17

Geoposition data delineate two populations, one using spawning grounds in the Gulf of Mexico and another from the Mediterranean Sea. Transatlantic movements of western-tagged bluefin tuna reveal site fidelity to known spawning areas in the Mediterranean Sea. Bluefin tuna that occupy western spawning grounds move to central and eastern Atlantic foraging grounds. Our results are consistent with two populations of bluefin tuna with distinct spawning areas that overlap on North Atlantic foraging grounds. Electronic tagging locations, when combined with US pelagic longline observer and logbook catch data, identify hot spots for spawning bluefin tuna in the northern slope waters of the Gulf of Mexico.

Although there is evidence for kin-biased helping behaviour in several species(1,4,5), the mechanism of kin recognition underlying this behaviour is poorly understood(2). Vocalizations are the most commonly used cues in avian recognition systems(6,7), but the effectiveness of vocal signals as reliable recognition cues must depend on how they are acquired(6-9). However, there have been no experimental studies of the development of vocal recognition cues in cooperative birds; indeed, the ontogeny of all bird vocalizations other than song is poorly known in any species(10-12). Here, we show that cooperatively breeding long-tailed tits (Aegithalos caudatus) can discriminate between kin and non-kin according to the individual-specific characteristics of contact calls, and show experimentally that individuals learn these calls from provisioning adults during the nestling period.

In receiver cells, 'band-detect' gene networks respond to user-defined ranges of AHL concentrations. By fusing different fluorescent proteins as outputs of network variants, an initially undifferentiated 'lawn' of receivers is engineered to form a bullseye pattern around a sender colony. Other patterns, such as ellipses and clovers, are achieved by placing senders in different configurations. Experimental and theoretical analyses reveal which kinetic parameters most significantly affect ring development over time.

Complex chemical reaction networks displaying spatiotemporal dynamics have been controlled and understood by perturbing their environment in space and time(1-3). Here, we apply this approach using microfluidics to investigate the robust network in Drosophila melanogaster that compensates for variation in the Bicoid morphogen gradient. We show that the compensation system can counteract the effects of extremely unnatural environmental conditions-a temperature step-in which the anterior and posterior halves of the embryo are developing at different temperatures and thus at different rates. Embryonic patterning was normal under this condition, suggesting that a simple reciprocal gradient system is not the mechanism of compensation. Time-specific reversals of the temperature step narrowed down the critical period for compensation to between 65 and 100 min after onset of embryonic development.

Usually such responses are self-limiting, but aberrant resolution of inflammation results in chronic diseases(1). Much attention has focused on pro-inflammatory signalling but little is known about the mechanisms that resolve inflammation. The I kappa B kinase (IKK) complex contains two catalytic subunits, IKK alpha and IKK beta, and controls the activation of NF-kappa B transcription factors, which play a pivotal role in inflammation(2). Ample evidence indicates that IKK beta mediates NF-kappa B activation in response to pro-inflammatory cytokines and microbial products. IKK alpha regulates an alternative pathway important for lymphoid organogenesis(2), but the role of IKK alpha in inflammation is unknown. Here we describe a new role for IKK alpha in the negative regulation of macrophage activation and inflammation. IKK alpha contributes to suppression of NF-kappa B activity by accelerating both the turnover of the NF-kappa B subunits RelA and c-Rel, and their removal from pro-inflammatory gene promoters. Inactivation of IKK alpha in mice enhances inflammation and bacterial clearance. Hence, the two IKK catalytic subunits have evolved opposing but complimentary roles needed for the intricate control of inflammation and innate immunity.","Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Pharmacol, Lab Gene Regulat & Signal Transduct, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; Univ Calif San Diego, Sch Med, Div Paediat Infect Dis, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA","Lawrence, T (reprint author), Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Fac Med, Div Rheumatol, Kennedy Inst, 1 Aspenlea Rd, London W6 8LH, England.",t.lawrence@imperial.ac.uk,"Tang, Amy/L-3226-2016","Tang, Amy/0000-0002-5772-2878; Nizet, Victor/0000-0003-3847-0422",,,,30,422,446,0,21,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,28-Apr,2005,434,7037,,,,,1138,1143,,10.1038/nature03491,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,920MD,WOS:000228693300045,15858576,No,,,11/20/17

The molecular basis of most myeloproliferative disorders is unknown. On the basis of the model of chronic myeloid leukaemia, it is expected that a constitutive tyrosine kinase activity could be at the origin of these diseases. Polycythaemia vera is an acquired myeloproliferative disorder, characterized by the presence of polycythaemia diversely associated with thrombocytosis, leukocytosis and splenomegaly(3). Polycythaemia vera progenitors are hypersensitive to erythropoietin and other cytokines(4,5). Here, we describe a clonal and recurrent mutation in the JH2 pseudo-kinase domain of the Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) gene in most (>80%) polycythaemia vera patients. The mutation, a valine-to-phenylalanine substitution at amino acid position 617, leads to constitutive tyrosine phosphorylation activity that promotes cytokine hypersensitivity and induces erythrocytosis in a mouse model. As this mutation is also found in other myeloproliferative disorders, this unique mutation will permit a new molecular classification of these disorders and novel therapeutical approaches.","Univ Paris 11, Inst Gustave Roussy, INSERM, U362, F-94805 Villejuif, France; CHU Brest, Hematol Lab, F-29609 Brest, France; Hop Hotel Dieu, Hematol Lab, F-75181 Paris, France; Univ Catholique Louvain, Ludwig Inst Canc Res, B-1200 Brussels, Belgium; Univ Catholique Louvain, Christian de Duve Inst Cellular Pathol, B-1200 Brussels, Belgium; Univ Catholique Louvain, MEXP Unit, B-1200 Brussels, Belgium; Hop Necker Enfants Malad, INSERM, E0210, F-75743 Paris, France; Inst Gustave Roussy, Hematol Lab, F-94805 Villejuif, France; Hop St Louis, Polyclin Hematol, F-75475 Paris, France","Vainchenker, W (reprint author), Univ Paris 11, Inst Gustave Roussy, INSERM, U362, PR1,39 Rue Camille Desmoulins, F-94805 Villejuif, France.",verpre@igr.fr,"james, chloe/A-2015-2012; Constantinescu, Stefan /E-5277-2012","Constantinescu, Stefan/0000-0002-8599-2699; Delhommeau, Francois/0000-0002-4915-0734; Villeval, Jean-Luc/0000-0002-0562-925X",,,,27,2050,2175,8,84,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,28-Apr,2005,434,7037,,,,,1144,1148,,10.1038/nature03546,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,920MD,WOS:000228693300046,15793561,No,,,11/20/17

Here, we show that peak virus production in gut tissues of SIV-infected rhesus macaques coincides with peak numbers of infected memory CD4(+) T cells. Surprisingly, most of the initially infected memory cells were not, as expected(10,11), activated but were instead immunophenotypically 'resting' cells that, unlike truly resting cells, but like the first cells mainly infected at other mucosal sites and peripheral lymph nodes(12,13), are capable of supporting virus production. In addition to inducing immune activation and thereby providing activated CD4(+) T-cell targets to sustain infection, virus production also triggered(14) an immunopathologically limiting Fas-Fas-ligand-mediated apoptotic pathway(15,16) in lamina propria CD4(+) T cells, resulting in their preferential ablation. Thus, SIV exploits a large, resident population of resting memory CD4(+) T cells in GALT to produce peak levels of virus that directly (through lytic infection) and indirectly ( through apoptosis of infected and uninfected cells) deplete CD4(+) T cells in the effector arm of GALT. The scale of this CD4(+) T-cell depletion has adverse effects on the immune system of the host, underscoring the importance of developing countermeasures to SIV that are effective before infection of GALT.","Univ Minnesota, Sch Med, Dept Microbiol, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA; Univ Minnesota, Sch Publ Hlth, Div Biostat, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA; Univ Minnesota, Inst Technol, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA; Univ Calif Davis, Calif Natl Primate Res Ctr, Davis, CA 95616 USA; Univ Calif Davis, Ctr Comparat Med, Davis, CA 95616 USA; Univ Calif Davis, Sch Vet Med, Dept Pathol Microbiol & Immunol, Davis, CA 95616 USA; Univ Calif Davis, Sch Med, Div Infect Dis, Davis, CA 95616 USA","Haase, AT (reprint author), Univ Minnesota, Sch Med, Dept Microbiol, MMC 196,420 Delaware St SE, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA.",haase001@umn.edu,,,,,,26,680,704,0,18,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,28-Apr,2005,434,7037,,,,,1148,1152,,10.1038/nature03513,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,920MD,WOS:000228693300047,15793562,No,,,11/20/17

Here, we show that clathrin stabilizes fibres of the mitotic spindle to aid congression of chromosomes. Clathrin bound to the spindle directly by the amino-terminal domain of clathrin heavy chain. Depletion of clathrin heavy chain using RNA interference prolonged mitosis; kinetochore fibres were destabilized, leading to defective congression of chromosomes to the metaphase plate and persistent activation of the spindle checkpoint. Normal mitosis was rescued by clathrin triskelia but not the N-terminal domain of clathrin heavy chain, indicating that stabilization of kinetochore fibres was dependent on the unique structure of clathrin. The importance of clathrin for normal mitosis may be relevant to understanding human cancers that involve gene fusions of clathrin heavy chain.","MRC, Mol Biol Lab, Cambridge CB2 2QH, England; Univ Cambridge, Addenbrookes Hosp, Cambridge Inst Med Res, Cambridge CB2 2XY, England; Univ Cambridge, Addenbrookes Hosp, Dept Clin Biochem, Cambridge CB2 2XY, England","Royle, SJ (reprint author), MRC, Mol Biol Lab, Hills Rd, Cambridge CB2 2QH, England.",sjr51@mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk,,"Royle, Stephen/0000-0001-8927-6967","Medical Research Council [MC_U105178794, U.1051.02.006(78794)]",,,30,152,154,1,12,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,28-Apr,2005,434,7037,,,,,1152,1157,,10.1038/nature03502,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,920MD,WOS:000228693300048,15858577,No,,,11/20/17

Temperature records derived from central Greenland ice cores show one significant temperature anomaly between 8,200 and 8,100 years ago, which is often attributed to a meltwater outflow into the North Atlantic Ocean and a slowdown of North Atlantic Deep Water formation-this anomaly provides an opportunity to study such processes with relevance to present-day freshening of the North Atlantic. Anomalies in climate proxy records from locations around the globe are often correlated with this sharp event in Greenland. But the anomalies in many of these records span 400 to 600 years, start from about 8,600 years ago and form part of a repeating pattern within the Holocene. More sudden climate changes around 8,200 years ago appear superimposed on this longer-term cooling. The compounded nature of the signals implies that far-field climate anomalies around 8,200 years ago cannot be used in a straightforward manner to assess the impact of a slowdown of North Atlantic Deep Water formation, and the geographical extent of the rapid cooling event 8,200 years ago remains to be determined.","Southampton Oceanog Ctr, Southampton SO14 3ZH, Hants, England","Rohling, EJ (reprint author), Southampton Oceanog Ctr, Southampton SO14 3ZH, Hants, England.",E.Rohling@soc.soton.ac.uk,"Palike, Heiko/A-6560-2008; Rohling, Eelco/B-9736-2008","Palike, Heiko/0000-0003-3386-0923; Rohling, Eelco/0000-0001-5349-2158",,,,50,375,388,1,64,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,21-Apr,2005,434,7036,,,,,975,979,,10.1038/nature03421,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,918EH,WOS:000228524600028,15846336,No,,,11/20/17

Here we visualized individual kinetochore-microtubule interactions in Saccharomyces cerevisiae by regulating the activity of a centromere. Kinetochores are captured by the side of microtubules extending from spindle poles, and are subsequently transported poleward along them. The microtubule extension from spindle poles requires microtubule plus-end-tracking proteins and the Ran GDP/GTP exchange factor. Distinct kinetochore components are used for kinetochore capture by microtubules and for ensuring subsequent sister kinetochore bi-orientation on the spindle. Kar3, a kinesin-14 family member, is one of the regulators that promote transport of captured kinetochores along microtubules. During such transport, kinetochores ensure that they do not slide off their associated microtubules by facilitating the conversion of microtubule dynamics from shrinkage to growth at the plus ends. This conversion is promoted by the transport of Stu2 from the captured kinetochores to the plus ends of microtubules.","Univ Dundee, Sch Life Sci, Wellcome Trust Bioctr, Dundee DD1 5EH, Scotland; Max Planck Inst Mol Cell Biol & Genet, D-01307 Dresden, Germany; European Mol Biol Lab, D-69117 Heidelberg, Germany","Tanaka, K (reprint author), Univ Dundee, Sch Life Sci, Wellcome Trust Bioctr, Dundee DD1 5EH, Scotland.",t.tanaka@dundee.ac.uk,"James, Euan/K-1135-2012","James, Euan/0000-0001-7969-6570; Prescott, Alan/0000-0002-0747-7317",,,,50,172,176,0,8,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,21-Apr,2005,434,7036,,,,,987,994,,10.1038/nature03483,,8,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,918EH,WOS:000228524600030,15846338,No,,,11/20/17

A major unresolved issue is the relative timing of CAI and chondrule formation(1-4). From the presence of chondrule fragments in an igneous CAI, it was concluded that some chondrules formed before CAIs (ref. 5). This conclusion is contrary to the presence of relict CAIs inside chondrules(6-10), as well as to the higher abundance of Al-26 in CAIs(11); both observations indicate that CAIs predate chondrules by 1-3 million years (Myr). Here we report that relict chondrule material in the Allende meteorite, composed of olivine and low-calcium pyroxene, occurs in the outer portions of two CAIs and is O-16-poor (Delta(17)O approximate to -1 parts per thousand to -5 parts per thousand). Spinel and diopside in the CAI cores are O-16-rich (Delta(17)O up to -20 parts per thousand), whereas diopside in their outer zones, as well as melilite and anorthite, are O-16-depleted (Delta(17)O = -8 parts per thousand to 2 parts per thousand).

We have identified six regions over North America and over the east Pacific and North Atlantic oceans where July wind anomalies, averaged between heights of 925 and 400 mbar, exhibit a stationary and significant link to the energy of landfalling hurricanes during the subsequent hurricane season. The wind anomalies in these regions are indicative of atmospheric circulation patterns that either favour or hinder evolving hurricanes from reaching US shores.","UCL, Dept Space & Climate Phys, Benfield Hazard Res Ctr, Dorking RH5 6NT, Surrey, England","Saunders, MA (reprint author), UCL, Dept Space & Climate Phys, Benfield Hazard Res Ctr, Holmbury St Mary, Dorking RH5 6NT, Surrey, England.",mas@mssl.ucl.ac.uk,,,,,,24,47,50,0,10,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,21-Apr,2005,434,7036,,,,,1005,1008,,10.1038/nature03454,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,918EH,WOS:000228524600034,15846342,No,,,11/20/17

Although this model is consistent with geodetic(4,5), geomorphic(6) and microseismic data(7), an alternative model incorporating slip on more northerly surface faults has been proposed to be consistent with these data as well(8-10). Here we present in situ cosmogenic Be-10 data indicating a fourfold increase in millennial timescale erosion rates occurring over a distance of less than 2 km in central Nepal, delineating for the first time an active thrust fault nearly 100 km north of the surface expression of the MHT. These data challenge the view that rock uplift gradients in central Nepal reflect only passive transport over a ramp in the MHT. Instead, when combined with previously reported Ar-40-Ar-39 data(9), our results indicate persistent exhumation above deep-seated, surface-breaking structures at the foot of the high Himalaya. These results suggest that strong dynamic interactions between climate, erosion and tectonics have maintained a locus of active deformation well to the north of the Himalayan deformation front.","MIT, Dept Earth Atmospher & Planetary Sci, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; Dartmouth Coll, Dept Earth Sci, Hanover, NH 03755 USA","Wobus, C (reprint author), MIT, Dept Earth Atmospher & Planetary Sci, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",cwobus@mit.edu,"Hodges, Kip/A-7992-2009","Hodges, Kip/0000-0003-2805-8899; Wobus, Cameron/0000-0002-9654-1738; Heimsath, Arjun/0000-0002-6300-6069",,,,27,175,184,1,36,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,21-Apr,2005,434,7036,,,,,1008,1011,,10.1038/nature03499,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,918EH,WOS:000228524600035,15846343,No,,,11/20/17

In the most extreme terrestrial climates, such as hot and cold deserts, endolithic microorganisms are often the main form of life(3-5). The endolithic microhabitat gives protection from intense solar radiation and desiccation, and it provides mineral nutrients, rock moisture and growth surfaces(4,5). Here we describe the discovery and identification of the constituents of an extremely acidic (pH 1) endolithic microbial community inhabiting the pore space of rocks in the geothermal environment of Yellowstone National Park, USA.

Island biogeographic theory has identified the roles of immigration and extinction in relation to area size and proximity to source areas(1,2), and the role of speciation is also recognized as an important factor(3-6). However, one as yet unexplored possibility is that species diversity itself might help to promote speciation, and indeed the central tenets of island biogeographic theory support such a prediction. Here we use data for plants and arthropods of the volcanic archipelagos of the Canary and Hawaiian Islands to address whether there is a positive relationship between species diversity and rate of diversification. Our index of diversification for each island is the proportion of species that are endemic, and we test our prediction that this increases with increasing species number. We show that even after controlling for several important physical features of islands, diversification is strongly related to species number.","Univ E Anglia, Sch Biol Sci, Ctr Ecol Evolut & Conservat, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England","Emerson, BC (reprint author), Univ E Anglia, Sch Biol Sci, Ctr Ecol Evolut & Conservat, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England.",b.emerson@uea.ac.uk,,"Kolm, Niclas/0000-0001-5791-336X; Emerson, Brent/0000-0003-4067-9858",,,,21,174,186,1,100,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,21-Apr,2005,434,7036,,,,,1015,1017,,10.1038/nature03450,,3,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,918EH,WOS:000228524600037,15846345,No,,,11/20/17

It has a defined sexual cycle involving haploid cells of a and a mating types(2), yet the vast majority of environmental and clinical isolates are a (ref. 3). Sexual recombination is normally expected to occur between isolates of opposite mating type in organisms with two mating types (or sexes). How sexual reproductive potential can be maintained in an organism with a largely unisexual, nearly clonal population genetic structure is unknown. One clue, however, is that a strains undergo fruiting, a process that resembles sexual mating(4) but is thought to be strictly mitotic and asexual. We report here that hallmarks of mating occur during fruiting, including diploidization and meiosis. Pheromone response pathway elements and the key meiotic regulator Dmc1 are required for efficient fruiting. Furthermore, fusion and meiosis can occur between non-isogenic a strains, enabling genetic exchange. These studies reveal how sexual reproduction can occur between partners of the same mating type. These findings have implications for the evolution of microbial pathogens, as well as for parthenogenesis, cell fusion events and transitions between self-fertilizing and outcrossing modes of reproduction observed in both fungi and other kingdoms.","Duke Univ, Med Ctr, Dept Mol Genet & Microbiol, Durham, NC 27710 USA","Lin, XR (reprint author), Duke Univ, Med Ctr, Dept Mol Genet & Microbiol, Durham, NC 27710 USA.",xrlin@duke.edu; heitm001@duke.edu,,,,,,30,225,234,2,32,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,21-Apr,2005,434,7036,,,,,1017,1021,,10.1038/nature03448,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,918EH,WOS:000228524600038,15846346,No,,,11/20/17

Mosaic expression of an exogenous potassium channel or a dominant-negative SNARE protein was used to suppress electrical or neurosecretory activity in subsets of RGC axons. Imaging in vivo showed that these forms of activity suppression strongly inhibit both net growth and the formation of new branches by individually transfected RGC axon arbors. The inhibition is relieved when the activity of nearby 'competing' RGC axons is also suppressed. These results therefore identify a new form of activity-based competition rule that might be a key regulator of axon growth and branch initiation.","Stanford Univ, Dept Cellular & Mol Physiol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; Stanford Univ, Neurosci Program, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Physiol, Program Neurosci, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA","Hua, JY (reprint author), Stanford Univ, Dept Cellular & Mol Physiol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",huayy@stanford.edu,,,,,,25,155,156,1,10,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,21-Apr,2005,434,7036,,,,,1022,1026,,10.1038/nature03409,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,918EH,WOS:000228524600039,15846347,No,,,11/20/17

Hyperglycaemia is a hallmark of diabetes and is largely due to increased hepatic gluconeogenesis(3). The medial hypothalamus is a major integrator of nutritional and hormonal signals(1,2,4), which play pivotal roles not only in the regulation of energy balance but also in the modulation of liver glucose output(5,6). Bidirectional changes in hypothalamic insulin signalling therefore result in parallel changes in both energy balance(7-10) and glucose metabolism(5). Here we show that activation of ATP-sensitive potassium (K-ATP) channels(11) in the mediobasal hypothalamus is sufficient to lower blood glucose levels through inhibition of hepatic gluconeogenesis. Finally, the infusion of a K-ATP blocker within the mediobasal hypothalamus, or the surgical resection of the hepatic branch of the vagus nerve, negates the effects of central insulin and halves the effects of systemic insulin on hepatic glucose production. Consistent with these results, mice lacking the SUR1 subunit of the K-ATP channel(12) are resistant to the inhibitory action of insulin on gluconeogenesis. These findings suggest that activation of hypothalamic K-ATP channels normally restrains hepatic gluconeogenesis, and that any alteration within this central nervous system/liver circuit can contribute to diabetic hyperglycaemia.","Albert Einstein Coll Med, Dept Med, Diabet Res Ctr, Bronx, NY 10461 USA; Albert Einstein Coll Med, Dept Neurosci, Diabet Res Ctr, Bronx, NY 10461 USA; Albert Einstein Coll Med, Dept Mol Pharmacol, Diabet Res Ctr, Bronx, NY 10461 USA; Baylor Coll Med, Dept Med, Houston, TX 77030 USA","Rossetti, L (reprint author), Albert Einstein Coll Med, Dept Med, Diabet Res Ctr, Bronx, NY 10461 USA.",rossetti@aecom.yu.edu,,,,,,29,369,380,0,16,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,21-Apr,2005,434,7036,,,,,1026,1031,,10.1038/nature03439,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,918EH,WOS:000228524600040,15846348,No,,,11/20/17

These phenotypes are due to the absence (in Lcc mutants) or reduced expression (in Ysb mutants) of the transcription factor SOX2, specifically within the developing inner ear.

It is absolutely dependent on the transcription factor IRF-7, which interacts with and is activated by the adaptor MyD88 (ref. 7). How plasmacytoid dendritic cells, but not other cell types (such as conventional dendritic cells), are able to activate the MyD88 IRF-7-dependent IFN induction pathway remains unknown. Here we show that the spatiotemporal regulation of MyD88 IRF-7 signalling is critical for a high-level IFN induction in response to TLR9 activation. The IFN-inducing TLR9 ligand, A/D-type CpG oligodeoxynucleotide (CpG-A)(3,4,8-11), is retained for long periods in the endosomal vesicles of plasmacytoid dendritic cells, together with the MyD88-IRF-7 complex. However, in conventional dendritic cells, CpG-A is rapidly transferred to lysosomal vesicles. We further show that conventional dendritic cells can also mount a robust IFN induction if CpG-A is manipulated for endosomal retention using a cationic lipid. This strategy also allows us to demonstrate endosomal activation of the IFN pathway by the otherwise inactive TLR9 ligand B/K-type oligodeoxynucleotide (CpG-B)(3,4,8-12). Thus, our study offers insights into the regulation of TLR9 signalling in space, potentially suggesting a new avenue for therapeutic intervention.","Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Med, Dept Immunol, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo 1130033, Japan; Univ Tokyo, Fac Med, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo 1130033, Japan; JST, PRESTO, Informat & Cell Funct, Kawaguchi, Saitama 3320012, Japan; Tokyo Metropolitan Inst Med Sci, Dept Lab Anim Sci, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo 1138613, Japan","Taniguchi, T (reprint author), Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Med, Dept Immunol, Bunkyo Ku, Hongo 7-3-1, Tokyo 1130033, Japan.",tada@m.u-tokyo.ac.jp,"Ohba, Yusuke/E-7944-2011; Honda, Kenya/N-5297-2015",,,,,30,559,591,1,19,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,21-Apr,2005,434,7036,,,,,1035,1040,,10.1038/nature03547,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,918EH,WOS:000228524600042,15815647,No,,,11/20/17

Using fluorescent resonance energy transfer (FRET), here we develop a genetically encoded Src reporter that enables the imaging and quantification of spatio-temporal activation of Src in live cells. We introduced a local mechanical stimulation to human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) by applying laser-tweezer traction on fibronectin-coated beads adhering to the cells. Using the Src reporter, we observed a rapid distal Src activation and a slower directional wave propagation of Src activation along the plasma membrane. This wave propagated away from the stimulation site with a speed (mean +/- s.e.m.) of 18.1 +/- 1.7 nm s(-1). This force-induced directional and long-range activation of Src was abolished by the disruption of actin filaments or microtubules. Our reporter has thus made it possible to monitor mechanotransduction in live cells with spatio-temporal characterization.

Using high-precision lead isotope data for both centrally and peripherally located volcanoes, we show here that the two trends have very little compositional overlap and instead reveal bilateral, non-concentric plume zones, probably derived from the plume source in the mantle. On a smaller scale, along the Kea chain, there are isotopic differences between the youngest lavas from the Mauna Kea and Kilauea volcanoes, but the 550-thousand-year-old Mauna Kea lavas are isotopically identical to Kilauea lavas, consistent with Mauna Kea's position relative to the plume, which was then similar to that of present-day Kilauea.

Hirschsprung disease (HSCR) is a multifactorial, non-mendelian disorder in which rare high-penetrance coding sequence mutations in the receptor tyrosine kinase RET contribute to risk in combination with mutations at other genes. We have used family-based association studies to identify a disease interval, and integrated this with comparative and functional genomic analysis to prioritize conserved and functional elements within which mutations can be sought. We now show that a common non-coding RET variant within a conserved enhancer-like sequence in intron 1 is significantly associated with HSCR susceptibility and makes a 20-fold greater contribution to risk than rare alleles do. This mutation reduces in vitro enhancer activity markedly, has low penetrance, has different genetic effects in males and females, and explains several features of the complex inheritance pattern of HSCR. Thus, common low-penetrance variants, identified by association studies, can underlie both common and rare diseases.","Johns Hopkins Univ, Sch Med, KcKusick Nathans Inst Genet Med, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA; NHGRI, Genome Technol Branch, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; NHGRI, NIH Intramural Sequencing Ctr, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA","Chakravarti, A (reprint author), Johns Hopkins Univ, Sch Med, KcKusick Nathans Inst Genet Med, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA.",aravinda@jhmi.edu,,"Grice, Elizabeth/0000-0003-3939-2200",,,,42,272,281,0,13,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,14-Apr,2005,434,7035,,,,,857,863,,10.1038/nature03467,,7,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,915SV,WOS:000228327600031,15829955,No,,,11/20/17

However, the nature of this stress remains elusive, as does the inducible anti-cancer barrier that elicits growth arrest or cell death. Here we show that in clinical specimens from different stages of human tumours of the urinary bladder, breast, lung and colon, the early precursor lesions ( but not normal tissues) commonly express markers of an activated DNA damage response. These include phosphorylated kinases ATM and Chk2, and phosphorylated histone H2AX and p53. Similar checkpoint responses were induced in cultured cells upon expression of different oncogenes that deregulate DNA replication. Together with genetic analyses, including a genome-wide assessment of allelic imbalances, our data indicate that early in tumorigenesis ( before genomic instability and malignant conversion), human cells activate an ATR/ATM- regulated DNA damage response network that delays or prevents cancer. Mutations compromising this checkpoint, including defects in the ATM - Chk2 p53 pathway, might allow cell proliferation, survival, increased genomic instability and tumour progression.","Danish Canc Soc, Inst Canc Biol, DK-2100 Copenhagen, Denmark; Danish Canc Soc, Ctr Genotox Stress Res, DK-2100 Copenhagen, Denmark; Aarhus Univ Hosp, Dept Clin Biochem, DK-8200 Aarhus, Denmark; Univ Copenhagen Hosp, Dept Pathol, DK-2100 Copenhagen, Denmark; Univ Oslo, Norwegian Radium Hosp, Dept Pathol, N-0310 Oslo, Norway; Acad Sci Czech Republ, Inst Genet Mol, CZ-16637 Prague, Czech Republic","Bartek, J (reprint author), Danish Canc Soc, Inst Canc Biol, Strandblvd 49, DK-2100 Copenhagen, Denmark.",jb@cancer.dk,"Bartek, Jiri/G-5870-2014","Tort, Frederic/0000-0003-2733-1603; Lukas, Jiri/0000-0001-9087-506X; Lukas, Claudia/0000-0001-7169-6883",,,,49,1671,1724,3,140,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,14-Apr,2005,434,7035,,,,,864,870,,10.1038/nature03482,,7,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,915SV,WOS:000228327600032,15829956,No,,,11/20/17

The relative abundances of elements in the surviving primitive stars reflect the masses of the first stars, because the pathways of nucleosynthesis are quite sensitive to stellar masses. Several models(1-5) have been suggested to explain the origin of the abundance pattern of the giant star HE0107 - 5240, which hitherto exhibited the highest deficiency of heavy elements known(1,6). Here we report the discovery of HE1327 - 2326, a subgiant or main-sequence star with an iron abundance about a factor of two lower than that of HE0107 - 5240. Both stars show extreme overabundances of carbon and nitrogen with respect to iron, suggesting a similar origin of the abundance patterns.

A major puzzle is why many of their orbits are highly eccentric; all planets in our Solar System are on nearly circular orbits, as is expected if they formed by accretion processes in a protostellar disk. Several mechanisms have been proposed to generate large eccentricities after planet formation, but so far there has been little observational evidence to support any particular model. Here we report that the current orbital configuration of the three giant planets around upsilon Andromedae(2,3) (v And) probably results from a close dynamical interaction with another planet(4), now lost from the system. The planets started on nearly circular orbits, but chaotic evolution caused the outer planet (v And d) to be perturbed suddenly into a higher-eccentricity orbit. The coupled evolution of the system then causes slow periodic variations in the eccentricity of the middle planet (v And c). Indeed, we show that v And c periodically returns to a very nearly circular state every 6,700 years.","Northwestern Univ, Dept Phys & Astron, Evanston, IL 60208 USA; Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Astron, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA","Rasio, FA (reprint author), Northwestern Univ, Dept Phys & Astron, Evanston, IL 60208 USA.",rasio@northwestern.edu,,"/0000-0001-6545-639X; Rasio, Frederic/0000-0002-7132-418X",,,,23,75,75,0,2,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,14-Apr,2005,434,7035,,,,,873,876,,10.1038/nature03427,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,915SV,WOS:000228327600034,15829958,No,,,11/20/17

To meet this challenge, increasing emphasis in analytical science has been directed towards materials and devices having highly nonlinear characteristics; semiconducting organic polymers (SOPs), with their facile excited state ( exciton) transport, are prime examples of amplifying materials(1-3). SOPs have also been recognized as promising lasing materials(4), although the susceptibility of these materials to optical damage has thus far limited applications. Here we report that attenuated lasing in optically pumped SOP thin films displays a sensitivity to vapours of explosives more than 30 times higher than is observed from spontaneous emission. Critical to this achievement was the development of a transducing polymer with high thin-film quantum yield, a high optical damage threshold in ambient atmosphere and a record low lasing threshold. Trace vapours of the explosives 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene ( TNT) and 2,4-dinitrotoluene (DNT) introduce non-radiative deactivation pathways(5) that compete with stimulated emission. We demonstrate that the induced cessation of the lasing action, and associated sensitivity enhancement, is most pronounced when films are pumped at intensities near their lasing threshold. The combined gains from amplifying materials and lasing promise to deliver sensors that can detect explosives with unparalleled sensitivity.","MIT, Dept Chem, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; MIT, Dept Elect Engn & Comp Engn, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA","Swager, TM (reprint author), MIT, Dept Chem, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",tswager@mit.edu; bulovic@mit.edu,"Zhu, Zhengguo/A-7870-2011; Swager, Timothy/H-7459-2012","Swager, Timothy/0000-0002-3577-0510",,,,18,481,489,11,133,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,14-Apr,2005,434,7035,,,,,876,879,,10.1038/nature03438,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,915SV,WOS:000228327600035,15829959,No,,,11/20/17

The lack of active-zone-anchored synaptic ribbons reduced the presynaptic readily releasable vesicle pool, and impaired synchronous auditory signalling as revealed by recordings of exocytic IHC capacitance changes and sound-evoked activation of spiral ganglion neurons. Both exocytosis of the hair cell releasable vesicle pool and the number of synchronously activated spiral ganglion neurons co-varied with the number of anchored ribbons during development. Interestingly, ribbon-deficient IHCs were still capable of sustained exocytosis with normal Ca2+-dependence. Endocytic membrane retrieval was intact, but an accumulation of tubular and cisternal membrane profiles was observed in ribbon-deficient IHCs.

Extracellular application of BDNF triggers membrane currents resembling those through TRPC ( transient receptor potential canonical) channels in rat pontine neurons(5) and in Xenopus spinal neurons(6). Here, we report that in cultured cerebellar granule cells, TRPC channels contribute to the BDNF-induced elevation of Ca2+ at the growth cone and are required for BDNF-induced chemo-attractive turning. Several members of the TRPC family are highly expressed in these neurons, and both Ca2+ elevation and growth-cone turning induced by BDNF are abolished by pharmacological inhibition of TRPC channels, overexpression of a dominant-negative form of TRPC3 or TRPC6, or downregulation of TRPC3 expression via short interfering RNA.

Here, we report that TRP-like channel activity exists in the growth cones of cultured Xenopus neurons and can be modulated by exposure to netrin-1 and brain-derived neurotrophic factor, two chemoattractants for axon guidance. Whole-cell recording from growth cones showed that netrin-1 induced a membrane depolarization, part of which remained after all major voltage-dependent channels were blocked. Furthermore, the membrane depolarization was sensitive to blockers of TRP channels. Pharmacological blockade of putative TRP currents or downregulation of Xenopus TRP-1 (xTRPC1) expression with a specific morpholino oligonucleotide abolished the growth-cone turning and Ca2+ elevation induced by a netrin-1 gradient. Thus, TRPC currents reflect early events in the growth cone's detection of some extracellular guidance signals, resulting in membrane depolarization and cytoplasmic Ca2+ elevation that mediates the turning of growth cones.","Univ Calif Berkeley, Helen Wills Neurosci Inst, Dept Mol & Cell Biol, Div Neurobiol, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA","Poo, MM (reprint author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Helen Wills Neurosci Inst, Dept Mol & Cell Biol, Div Neurobiol, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",mpoo@berkeley.edu,,,,,,29,213,223,1,9,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,14-Apr,2005,434,7035,,,,,898,904,,10.1038/nature03478,,7,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,915SV,WOS:000228327600041,15758951,No,,,11/20/17

The host range of JSRV is in part limited by species-specific differences in the virus entry receptor, hyaluronidase 2 (Hyal2), which is not functional as a receptor in mice but is functional in humans(2). Sheep are immunotolerant of JSRV because of the expression of closely related endogenous retroviruses(3,4), which are not present in humans and most other species, and this may facilitate oncogenesis. Here we show that expression of the JSRV envelope (Env) protein alone in lungs of mice, by using a replication-incompetent adeno-associated virus vector, results in tumours with a bronchiolo-alveolar localization like those seen in sheep. Whereas lethal disease was observed in immunodeficient mice, tumour development was almost entirely blocked in immunocompetent mice. Our results provide a rare example of an oncogenic viral structural protein, show that interaction of the viral Env protein with the virus entry receptor Hyal2 is not required for tumorigenesis, and indicate that immune recognition of Env can protect against JSRV tumorigenesis.","Fred Hutchinson Canc Res Ctr, Seattle, WA 98109 USA","Miller, AD (reprint author), Fred Hutchinson Canc Res Ctr, 1100 Fairview Ave N, Seattle, WA 98109 USA.",dmiller@fhcrc.org,,"Miller, Dusty/0000-0002-3736-3660",NIDDK NIH HHS [P30 DK047754],,,24,101,109,0,7,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,14-Apr,2005,434,7035,,,,,904,907,,10.1038/nature03492,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,915SV,WOS:000228327600042,15829964,No,,,11/20/17

We analysed a panel of human lung hyperplasias, all of which retained wild-type p53 genes and had no signs of gross chromosomal instability, and found signs of a DNA damage response, including histone H2AX and Chk2 phosphorylation, p53 accumulation, focal staining of p53 binding protein 1 (53BP1) and apoptosis. Progression to carcinoma was associated with p53 or 53BP1 inactivation and decreased apoptosis. A DNA damage response was also observed in dysplastic nevi and in human skin xenografts, in which hyperplasia was induced by overexpression of growth factors. Both lung and experimentally-induced skin hyperplasias showed allelic imbalance at loci that are prone to DNA double-strand break formation when DNA replication is compromised ( common fragile sites). We propose that, from its earliest stages, cancer development is associated with DNA replication stress, which leads to DNA double-strand breaks, genomic instability and selective pressure for p53 mutations.","Wistar Inst Anat & Biol, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; Univ Athens, Sch Med, Dept Histol & Embryol, GR-11527 Athens, Greece; Univ Liverpool, Ctr Canc Res, Roy Castle Lung Canc Res Programme, Liverpool, Merseyside, England; Univ Penn, Grad Grp Biomed Sci, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; Univ Penn, Dept Pathol & Lab Med, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; Mt Sinai Sch Med, Dept Human Genet, New York, NY 10029 USA; Demokritos Natl Ctr Sci Res, Inst Biol, GR-15310 Athens, Greece","Halazonetis, TD (reprint author), Wistar Inst Anat & Biol, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",halazonetis@wistar.upenn.edu,"Kletsas, Dimitris/F-6953-2010; Halazonetis, Thanos/D-7923-2011",,,,,29,1293,1335,2,75,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,14-Apr,2005,434,7035,,,,,907,913,,10.1038/nature03485,,7,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,915SV,WOS:000228327600043,15829965,No,,,11/20/17

Nevertheless, PARP1(-/-) mice are viable, fertile and do not develop early onset tumours(4). Here, we show that PARP inhibitors trigger gamma-H2AX and RAD51 foci formation. We propose that, in the absence of PARP1, spontaneous single-strand breaks collapse replication forks and trigger homologous recombination for repair. Furthermore, we show that BRCA2-deficient cells, as a result of their deficiency in homologous recombination, are acutely sensitive to PARP inhibitors, presumably because resultant collapsed replication forks are no longer repaired. Thus, PARP1 activity is essential in homologous recombination-deficient BRCA2 mutant cells. We exploit this requirement in order to kill BRCA2-deficient tumours by PARP inhibition alone. Treatment with PARP inhibitors is likely to be highly tumour specific, because only the tumours ( which are BRCA2(-/-)) in BRCA2(+/-) patients are defective in homologous recombination. The use of an inhibitor of a DNA repair enzyme alone to selectively kill a tumour, in the absence of an exogenous DNA-damaging agent, represents a new concept in cancer treatment.","Univ Sheffield, Sch Med, Inst Canc Studies, Sheffield S10 2RX, S Yorkshire, England; Stockholm Univ, Arrhenius Lab, Dept Genet Microbiol & Toxicol, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden; Newcastle Univ, Sch Med, No Inst Canc Res, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE2 4HH, Tyne & Wear, England","Helleday, T (reprint author), Univ Sheffield, Sch Med, Inst Canc Studies, Beech Hill Rd, Sheffield S10 2RX, S Yorkshire, England.",t.helleday@sheffield.ac.uk,"Helleday, Thomas/D-5224-2013","Lopez Knowles, Elena/0000-0002-0893-3361; Helleday, Thomas/0000-0002-7384-092X",,,,25,1877,1921,18,149,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,14-Apr,2005,434,7035,,,,,913,917,,10.1038/nature03443,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,915SV,WOS:000228327600044,15829966,No,,,11/20/17

Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase ( PARP) is an enzyme involved in base excision repair, a key pathway in the repair of DNA single-strand breaks(3). We show here that BRCA1 or BRCA2 dysfunction unexpectedly and profoundly sensitizes cells to the inhibition of PARP enzymatic activity, resulting in chromosomal instability, cell cycle arrest and subsequent apoptosis. This seems to be because the inhibition of PARP leads to the persistence of DNA lesions normally repaired by homologous recombination. These results illustrate how different pathways cooperate to repair damage, and suggest that the targeted inhibition of particular DNA repair pathways may allow the design of specific and less toxic therapies for cancer.","Canc Res UK Gene Funct & Regulat Grp, London SW3 6JB, England; Inst Canc Res, Breakthrough Breast Canc Res Ctr, London SW3 6JB, England; Guys Hosp, London SE1 9RT, England; KuDOS Pharmaceut Ltd, Cambridge CB4 0WG, England; Univ Cambridge, Gurdon Inst Canc & Dev Biol, Wellcome Trust & Canc REs UK, Cambridge CB2 1QN, England; Univ Cambridge, Dept Zool, Cambridge CB2 1QN, England","Ashworth, A (reprint author), Canc Res UK Gene Funct & Regulat Grp, Fulham Rd, London SW3 6JB, England.",gcmsmith@kudospharma.co.uk; alan.ashworth@icr.ac.uk,"Lord, Christopher/B-3295-2012; Santarosa, Manuela/A-7300-2013; Dry, Kate/I-2328-2014","Lord, Christopher/0000-0002-3226-0515; Hickson, Ian/0000-0002-9167-0514; Santarosa, Manuela/0000-0001-7682-2578; Jackson, Stephen Philip/0000-0001-9317-7937",,,,22,2394,2458,29,335,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,14-Apr,2005,434,7035,,,,,917,921,,10.1038/nature03445,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,915SV,WOS:000228327600045,15829967,No,,,11/20/17

This is particularly pertinent in cancer biology because downregulation of tumour metastasis suppressor genes is a common occurrence(1,2), and the underlying molecular mechanisms are not well established. Here we report that the downregulation of a metastasis suppressor gene, KAI1, in prostate cancer cells involves the inhibitory actions of beta-catenin, along with a reptin chromatin remodelling complex. This inhibitory function of beta-catenin - reptin requires both increased beta-catenin expression and recruitment of histone deacetylase activity. The coordinated actions of beta- catenin - reptin components that mediate the repressive state serve to antagonize a Tip60 coactivator complex(3-8) that is required for activation; the balance of these opposing complexes controls the expression of KAI1 and metastatic potential. The molecular mechanisms underlying the antagonistic regulation of b- catenin - reptin and the Tip60 coactivator complexes for the metastasis suppressor gene, KAI1, are likely to be prototypic of a selective downregulation strategy for many genes, including a subset of NF-kappa B target genes.","Seoul Natl Univ, Coll Nat Sci, Dept Sci Biol, Seoul 151742, South Korea; Univ Calif San Diego, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Dept Med, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; Univ Calif San Diego, Sch Med, Howard Hughes Med Inst, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; Univ Calif Los Angeles, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Dept Med, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; Charite, Inst Clin Chem & Pathobiochem, D-12200 Berlin, Germany; Univ Calif San Diego, Sch Med, Dept Med, Div Endocrinol & Metab, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA","Baek, SH (reprint author), Seoul Natl Univ, Coll Nat Sci, Dept Sci Biol, Seoul 151742, South Korea.",mrosenfeld@ucsd.edu; sbaek@snu.ac.kr,"Sawyers, Charles/G-5327-2016",,,,,25,208,219,2,9,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,14-Apr,2005,434,7035,,,,,921,926,,10.1038/nature03452,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,915SV,WOS:000228327600046,15829968,No,,,11/20/17

The apoptotic protease-activating factor 1 (Apaf-1) controls caspase activation downstream of mitochondria(2). During apoptosis, Apaf-1 binds to cytochrome c and in the presence of ATP/dATP forms an apoptosome, leading to the recruitment and activation of the initiator caspase, caspase-9 ( ref. 2). The mechanisms underlying Apaf-1 function are largely unknown. Here we report the 2.2-angstrom crystal structure of an ADP-bound, WD40-deleted Apaf-1, which reveals the molecular mechanism by which Apaf-1 exists in an inactive state before ATP binding. The amino-terminal caspase recruitment domain packs against a three-layered alpha/beta fold, a short helical motif and a winged-helix domain, resulting in the burial of the caspase-9-binding interface. The deeply buried ADP molecule serves as an organizing centre to strengthen interactions between these four adjoining domains, thus locking Apaf-1 in an inactive conformation. Apaf-1 binds to and hydrolyses ATP/dATP and their analogues. The binding and hydrolysis of nucleotides seem to drive conformational changes that are essential for the formation of the apoptosome and the activation of caspase-9.","Princeton Univ, Lewis Thomas Lab, Dept Mol Biol, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; Univ Calif San Diego, Joint Ctr Struct Genom, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA","Shi, YG (reprint author), Princeton Univ, Lewis Thomas Lab, Dept Mol Biol, Washington Rd, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA.",yshi@molbio.princeton.edu,,,,,,30,213,222,6,57,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,14-Apr,2005,434,7035,,,,,926,933,,10.1038/nature03465,,8,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,915SV,WOS:000228327600047,15829969,No,,,11/20/17

Here we report the first identification of an insect-induced belowground plant signal, (E)-beta-caryophyllene, which strongly attracts an entomopathogenic nematode. Maize roots release this sesquiterpene in response to feeding by larvae of the beetle Diabrotica virgifera virgifera, a maize pest that is currently invading Europe. Most North American maize lines do not release (E)-beta-caryophyllene, whereas European lines and the wild maize ancestor, teosinte, readily do so in response to D. v. virgifera attack. This difference was consistent with striking differences in the attractiveness of representative lines in the laboratory. Field experiments showed a fivefold higher nematode infection rate of D. v. virgifera larvae on a maize variety that produces the signal than on a variety that does not, whereas spiking the soil near the latter variety with authentic (E)-beta-caryophyllene decreased the emergence of adult D. v. virgifera to less than half. North American maize lines must have lost the signal during the breeding process.

Optically luminous quasars host the most prodigious accreting black holes in the Universe, and can account for greater than or similar to 30 per cent of the total cosmological black-hole growth(2,3). As typical quasars are not, however, undergoing intense star formation and already host massive black holes (>10(8) M (circle dot), where M (circle dot) is the solar mass)(4,5), there must have been an earlier pre-quasar phase when these black holes grew (mass range similar to(10(6)-10(8))M((circle dot)). The likely signature of this earlier stage is simultaneous black-hole growth and star formation in distant (redshift z > 1; > 8 billion light years away) luminous galaxies. Here we report ultra-deep X-ray observations of distant star-forming galaxies that are bright at submillimetre wavelengths. We find that the black holes in these galaxies are growing almost continuously throughout periods of intense star formation.

These planets should be hot and so emit detectable infrared radiation(2). The planet HD 209458b (refs 3, 4) is an ideal candidate for the detection and characterization of this infrared light because it is eclipsed by the star. This planet has an anomalously large radius (1.35 times that of Jupiter(5)), which may be the result of ongoing tidal dissipation(6), but this explanation requires a non-zero orbital eccentricity (similar to 0.03; refs 6, 7), maintained by interaction with a hypothetical second planet. Here we report detection of infrared (24-mu m) radiation from HD 209458b, by observing the decrement in flux during secondary eclipse, when the planet passes behind the star. The planet's 24-mu m flux is 55 +/- 10 mu Jy (1 sigma), with a brightness temperature of 1,130 +/- 150 K, confirming the predicted heating by stellar irradiation(2,8). The secondary eclipse occurs at the midpoint between transits of the planet in front of the star (to within +/- 7 min, 1 sigma), which means that a dynamically significant orbital eccentricity is unlikely.","NASA, Goddard Space Flight Ctr, Planetary Syst Lab, Greenbelt, MD 20771 USA; NASA, Goddard Ctr Astrobiol, Greenbelt, MD 20771 USA; NASA, Goddard Space Flight Ctr, Exoplanet & Stellar Astrophys Lab, Greenbelt, MD 20771 USA; Carnegie Inst Sci, Dept Terr Magnetism, Washington, DC 20015 USA; Cornell Univ, Ctr Radiophys & Space Res, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA","Deming, D (reprint author), NASA, Goddard Space Flight Ctr, Planetary Syst Lab, Code 693, Greenbelt, MD 20771 USA.",Leo.D.Deming@nasa.gov,"Harrington, Joseph/E-6250-2011","Harrington, Joseph/0000-0002-8955-8531",,,,28,404,407,1,22,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,7-Apr,2005,434,7034,,,,,740,743,,10.1038/nature03507,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,913NU,WOS:000228160700034,15785769,No,,,11/20/17

Previous strategies-where hydrogen has been bound chemically(2), adsorbed in materials with permanent void space(3) or stored in hybrid materials that combine these elements(3)-have problems arising from either technical considerations or materials cost(2-5). A recently reported(6-8) clathrate hydrate of hydrogen exhibiting two different-sized cages does seem to meet the necessary storage requirements; however, the extreme pressures (similar to 2 kbar) required to produce the material make it impractical. The synthesis pressure can be decreased by filling the larger cavity with tetrahydrofuran (THF) to stabilize the material(9), but the potential storage capacity of the material is compromised with this approach. Here we report that hydrogen storage capacities in THF-containing binary-clathrate hydrates can be increased to similar to 4wt% at modest pressures by tuning their composition to allow the hydrogen guests to enter both the larger and the smaller cages, while retaining low-pressure stability. The tuning mechanism is quite general and convenient, using water-soluble hydrate promoters and various small gaseous guests.","Korea Adv Inst Sci & Technol, Dept Chem & Biomol Engn, Taejon 305701, South Korea; Natl Res Council Canada, Steacie Inst Mol Sci, Ottawa, ON K1A 0R6, Canada","Lee, H (reprint author), Korea Adv Inst Sci & Technol, Dept Chem & Biomol Engn, Taejon 305701, South Korea.",h_lee@kaist.ac.kr; John.Ripmeester@nrc-cnrc.gc.ca,"Lee, Huen/C-1922-2011; Seo, Yutaek/B-3384-2012; Zeng, Huang/A-2192-2010","Zeng, Huang/0000-0003-0293-7692",,,,13,476,484,8,124,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,7-Apr,2005,434,7034,,,,,743,746,,10.1038/nature03457,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,913NU,WOS:000228160700035,15815624,No,,,11/20/17

Minerals in the transition zone of the Earth's mantle (from similar to 410 to similar to 660 km depth) have large water solubility(1-3), and hence it is thought that the transition zone might act as a water reservoir. When the water content of the transition zone exceeds a critical value, upwelling flow might result in partial melting at similar to 410 km, which would affect the distribution of certain elements in the Earth(4). However, the amount of water in the transition zone has remained unknown. Here we determined the effects of water and temperature on the electrical conductivity of the minerals wadsleyite and ringwoodite to infer the water content of the transition zone. We find that the electrical conductivity of these minerals depends strongly on water content but only weakly on temperature. By comparing these results with geophysically inferred conductivity(5-7), we infer that the water content in the mantle transition zone varies regionally, but that its value in the Pacific is estimated to be similar to 0.1-0.2wt%. These values significantly exceed the estimated critical water content in the upper mantle(3,8,9), suggesting that partial melting may indeed occur at similar to 410 km depth, at least in this region.","Yale Univ, Dept Geol & Geophys, New Haven, CT 06511 USA; Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geol & Geophys, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China","Karato, SI (reprint author), Yale Univ, Dept Geol & Geophys, POB 6666, New Haven, CT 06511 USA.",shun-ichiro.karato@yale.edu,"_____, ___________/E-2300-2014",,,,,22,219,248,4,67,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,7-Apr,2005,434,7034,,,,,746,749,,10.1038/nature03426,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,913NU,WOS:000228160700036,15815625,No,,,11/20/17

Here we show that gouge from the San Andreas fault, California, with similar to 160 km slip, and the rupture zone of a recent earthquake in a South African mine with only similar to 0.4 m slip, display similar characteristics, in that ultrafine grains approach the nanometre scale, gouge surface areas approach 80 m(2) g(-1), and grain size distribution is nonfractal. These observations challenge the common perception that gouge texture is fractal(10,11) and that gouge surface energy is a negligible contributor to the earthquake energy budget(3,9,12).

Whether the evolution of common traits in different lineages proceeds by similar or unique mutations, and the degree to which phenotypic evolution is controlled by changes in gene regulation as opposed to gene function, are fundamental questions in evolutionary biology that require such an understanding of genetic mechanisms(1-3). Here we identify novel changes in the molecular structure of a sodium channel expressed in snake skeletal muscle, tsNa(V)1.4, that are responsible for differences in tetrodotoxin (TTX) resistance among garter snake populations coevolving with toxic newts(4). By the functional expression of tsNa(V)1.4, we show how differences in the amino-acid sequence of the channel affect TTX binding and impart different levels of resistance in four snake populations.

PSTs cause human fatalities by blocking sodium conductance in nerve fibres(4,5). Here we identify a molecular basis for inter-population variation in PSP resistance within a species, consistent with genetic adaptation to PSTs. Softshell clams (Mya arenaria) from areas exposed to 'red tides' are more resistant to PSTs, as demonstrated by whole-nerve assays, and accumulate toxins at greater rates than sensitive clams from unexposed areas. PSTs lead to selective mortality of sensitive clams. Resistance is caused by natural mutation of a single amino acid residue, which causes a 1,000-fold decrease in affinity at the saxitoxin-binding site in the sodium channel pore of resistant, but not sensitive, clams. Thus PSTs might act as potent natural selection agents, leading to greater toxin resistance in clam populations and increased risk of PSP in humans. Furthermore, global expansion of PSP to previously unaffected coastal areas(6) might result in long-term changes to communities and ecosystems.","Natl Res Council Canada, Inst Marine Biosci, Halifax, NS B3H 3Z1, Canada; Univ Maine, Sch Marine Sci, Orono, ME 04469 USA; Univ Washington, Dept Pharmacol, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; NOAA Fisheries, NW Fisheries Sci Ctr, Seattle, WA 98112 USA","Bricelj, VM (reprint author), Natl Res Council Canada, Inst Marine Biosci, Halifax, NS B3H 3Z1, Canada.",monica.bricelj@nrc-cnrc.gc.ca,"Konoki, Keiichi/O-9600-2014",,,,,27,156,168,1,63,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,7-Apr,2005,434,7034,,,,,763,767,,10.1038/nature03415,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,913NU,WOS:000228160700041,15815630,No,,,11/20/17

Previously we mapped a new genetic locus on mouse chromosome 1, designated sst1 (for supersusceptibility to tuberculosis 1)(4). Here we show that this locus mediates innate immunity in sst1 congenic mouse strains and identify a candidate gene, Intracellular pathogen resistance 1 (Ipr1), within the sst1 locus. The Ipr1 gene is upregulated in the sst1 resistant macrophages after activation and infection, but it is not expressed in the sst1 susceptible macrophages. Expression of the Ipr1 transgene in the sst1 susceptible macrophages limits the multiplication not only of M. tuberculosis but also of Listeria monocytogenes and switches a cell death pathway of the infected macrophages from necrosis to apoptosis.

Using mice deficient in the Irf7 gene (Irf7(-/-) mice), we show that the transcription factor IRF-7 is essential for the induction of IFN-alpha/beta genes via the virus-activated, MyD88-independent pathway and the TLR-activated, MyD88-dependent pathway. Viral induction of MyD88-independent IFN-alpha/beta genes is severely impaired in Irf7(-/-) fibroblasts. Consistently, Irf7(-/-) mice are more vulnerable than Myd88(-/-) mice to viral infection, and this correlates with a marked decrease in serum IFN levels, indicating the importance of the IRF-7-dependent induction of systemic IFN responses for innate antiviral immunity. Furthermore, robust induction of IFN production by activation of the TLR9 subfamily in plasmacytoid dendritic cells is entirely dependent on IRF-7, and this MyD88-IRF-7 pathway governs the induction of CD8(+) T-cell responses. Thus, all elements of IFN responses, whether the systemic production of IFN in innate immunity or the local action of IFN from plasmacytoid dendritic cells in adaptive immunity, are under the control of IRF-7.","Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Med, Dept Immunol, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo 1130033, Japan; Univ Tokyo, Fac Med, Tokyo 1130033, Japan; Univ Tokyo, Inst Med Sci, Minato Ku, Tokyo 1088639, Japan; JST, PRESTO, Informat & Cell Funct, Kawaguchi, Saitama 3320012, Japan","Taniguchi, T (reprint author), Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Med, Dept Immunol, Bunkyo Ku, Hongo 7-3-1, Tokyo 1130033, Japan.",tada@m.u-tokyo.ac.jp,"Yang, Chen/G-1379-2010; Ohba, Yusuke/E-7944-2011; Honda, Kenya/N-5297-2015",,,,,30,1260,1319,5,92,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,7-Apr,2005,434,7034,,,,,772,777,,10.1038/nature03464,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,913NU,WOS:000228160700043,15800576,No,,,11/20/17

In asthma, pulmonary airways narrow in response to contraction of surrounding smooth muscle. The precise nature of functional changes during an acute asthma attack is unclear. The tree structure of the pulmonary airways has been linked to complex behaviour in sudden airway narrowing(1,2) and avalanche-like reopening(3,4). Here we present experimental evidence that bronchoconstriction leads to patchiness in lung ventilation, as well as a computational model that provides interpretation of the experimental data. Using positron emission tomography, we observe that bronchoconstricted asthmatics develop regions of poorly ventilated lung. Using the computational model we show that, even for uniform smooth muscle activation of a symmetric bronchial tree, the presence of minimal heterogeneity breaks the symmetry and leads to large clusters of poorly ventilated lung units. These clusters are generated by interaction of short- and long-range feedback mechanisms, which lead to catastrophic shifts similar to those linked to self-organized patchiness in nature(5,6).

Derivatives of cannabinoids such as delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) modulate immune functions(2) and therefore have potential for the treatment of inflammatory diseases. We investigated the effects of THC in a murine model of established atherosclerosis. Oral administration of THC (1 mg kg(-1) per day) resulted in significant inhibition of disease progression. This effective dose is lower than the dose usually associated with psychotropic effects of THC. Furthermore, we detected the CB2 receptor ( the main cannabinoid receptor expressed on immune cells(2,3)) in both human and mouse atherosclerotic plaques. Lymphoid cells isolated from THC-treated mice showed diminished proliferation capacity and decreased interferon-gamma secretion. Macrophage chemotaxis, which is a crucial step for the development of atherosclerosis(1), was also inhibited in vitro by THC. All these effects were completely blocked by a specific CB2 receptor antagonist(4). Our data demonstrate that oral treatment with a low dose of THC inhibits atherosclerosis progression in the apolipoprotein E knockout mouse model, through pleiotropic immunomodulatory effects on lymphoid and myeloid cells. Thus, THC or cannabinoids with activity at the CB2 receptor may be valuable targets for treating atherosclerosis.","Fdn Med Res, Dept Med, Div Cardiol, CH-1211 Geneva, Switzerland; Univ Hosp, Fac Med, Div Gastroenterol, CH-1211 Geneva, Switzerland; Univ Hosp, Fac Med, Inst Legal Med, CH-1211 Geneva, Switzerland; Univ Bonn, Dept Psychiat, Mol Neurobiol Lab, D-53105 Bonn, Germany","Mach, F (reprint author), Fdn Med Res, Dept Med, Div Cardiol, CH-1211 Geneva, Switzerland.",Francois.Mach@medecine.unige.ch,"Zimmer, Andreas/B-8357-2009; Arnaud, Claire/D-4698-2014","Arnaud, Claire/0000-0003-0964-9423",,,,30,270,279,1,22,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,7-Apr,2005,434,7034,,,,,782,786,,10.1038/nature03389,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,913NU,WOS:000228160700045,15815632,No,,,11/20/17

A new mechanism for the impaired angiogenesis was established from cell culture studies. Although adhesion and proliferation were similar in primary cultures of aortic endothelia from wild-type and from AQP1-null mice, cell migration was greatly impaired in AQP1-deficient cells, with abnormal vessel formation in vitro. Stable transfection of non-endothelial cells with AQP1 or with a structurally different water-selective transletters porter (AQP4) accelerated cell migration and wound healing in vitro. Motile AQP1-expressing cells had prominent membrane ruffles at the leading edge with polarization of AQP1 protein to lamellipodia, where rapid water fluxes occur. Our findings support a fundamental role of water channels in cell migration, which is central to diverse biological phenomena including angiogenesis, wound healing, tumour spread and organ regeneration.","Univ Calif San Francisco, Cardiovasc Res Inst, Dept Med, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; Univ Calif San Francisco, Cardiovasc Res Inst, Dept Physiol, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA","Verkman, AS (reprint author), Univ Calif San Francisco, Cardiovasc Res Inst, Dept Med, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA.",verkman@itsa.ucsf.edu,,,,,,28,423,507,2,35,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,7-Apr,2005,434,7034,,,,,786,792,,10.1038/nature03460,,7,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,913NU,WOS:000228160700046,15815633,No,,,11/20/17

This can be resolved if the olivine of the mantle peridotite is consumed by reaction with melts derived from recycled oceanic crust, to form a secondary pyroxenitic source. Our modelling shows that more than half of Hawaiian magmas formed during the past 1 Myr came from this source. In addition, we estimate that the proportion of recycled ( oceanic) crust varies from 30 per cent near the plume centre to insignificant levels at the plume edge.

The underlying basis of tumorigenesis is thought to be linked to defects in DNA double-strand break repair by homologous recombination. Here we show that the carboxy-terminal region of BRCA2, which interacts directly with the essential recombination protein RAD51, contains a site (serine 3291; S3291) that is phosphorylated by cyclin-dependent kinases. Phosphorylation of S3291 is low in S phase when recombination is active, but increases as cells progress towards mitosis. This modification blocks C-terminal interactions between BRCA2 and RAD51. However, DNA damage overcomes cell cycle regulation by decreasing S3291 phosphorylation and stimulating interactions with RAD51. These results indicate that S3291 phosphorylation might provide a molecular switch to regulate RAD51 recombination activity, providing new insight into why BRCA2 C-terminal deletions lead to radiation sensitivity and cancer predisposition.","Canc Res UK, London Res Inst, Clare Hall Labs, S Mimms EN6 3LD, Herts, England; Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Program Mol Biol, New York, NY 10021 USA","West, SC (reprint author), Canc Res UK, London Res Inst, Clare Hall Labs, S Mimms EN6 3LD, Herts, England.",stephen.west@cancer.org.uk,,"West, Stephen/0000-0001-8848-9418; Esashi, Fumiko/0000-0003-0902-2364",Wellcome Trust [101009],,,48,266,272,0,19,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,31-Mar,2005,434,7033,,,,,598,604,,10.1038/nature03404,,7,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,911NN,WOS:000228011000035,15800615,No,,,11/20/17

ATM and DNA-PKcs respond mainly to DNA double-strand breaks, whereas ATR is activated by single-stranded DNA and stalled DNA replication forks. In all cases, activation involves their recruitment to the sites of damage. Here we identify related, conserved carboxy-terminal motifs in human Nbs1, ATRIP and Ku80 proteins that are required for their interaction with ATM, ATR and DNA-PKcs, respectively. These motifs are essential not only for efficient recruitment of ATM, ATR and DNA-PKcs to sites of damage, but are also critical for ATM-, ATR- and DNA-PKcs-mediated signalling events that trigger cell cycle checkpoints and DNA repair.

The X-ray structure of the trapped complex features a target G nucleobase extruded from the DNA helix but denied insertion into the lesion recognition pocket of the enzyme. Free energy difference calculations show that both attractive and repulsive interactions have an important role in the preferential binding of oxoG compared with G to the active site.

Here we report a precise determination of the oxygen isotopic composition of the solar wind from particles implanted in the outer hundreds of nanometres of metallic grains in the lunar regolith. These layers of the grains are enriched in (16)O by >20 +/- 4 parts per thousand relative to the Earth, Mars and bulk meteorites, which implies the existence in the solar accretion disk of reactions-as yet unknown-that were able to change the (17)O/(16)O and (18)O/(16)O ratios in a way that was not dependent strictly on the mass of the isotope. Photochemical self-shielding of the CO gas irradiated by ultraviolet light(5-7) may be one of these key processes, because it depends on the abundance of the isotopes, rather than their masses.","Osaka Univ, Grad Sch Sci, Dept Earth & Space Sci, Osaka 5600043, Japan; CNRS, CRPG, F-54501 Vandoeuvre Les Nancy, France","Hashizume, K (reprint author), Osaka Univ, Grad Sch Sci, Dept Earth & Space Sci, Osaka 5600043, Japan.",kohash@ess.sci.osaka-u.ac.jp,"Chaussidon, Marc/E-7067-2017",,,,,30,76,77,1,12,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,31-Mar,2005,434,7033,,,,,619,622,,10.1038/nature03432,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,911NN,WOS:000228011000038,15800617,No,,,11/20/17

Like lattice vibrations, antiferromagnetic fluctuations can also produce an attractive interaction creating Cooper pairs, though with spin and angular momentum properties different from those of conventional superconductors. Such interactions have been implicated for two disparate classes of materials-the copper oxides(1,2) and a set of Ce- and U-based compounds(3). But because their transition temperatures differ by nearly two orders of magnitude, this raises the question of whether a common pairing mechanism applies. PuCoGa5 has a transition temperature intermediate between those classes and therefore may bridge these extremes(4). Here we report measurements of the nuclear spin-lattice relaxation rate and Knight shift in PuCoGa5, which demonstrate that it is an unconventional superconductor with properties as expected for antiferromagnetically mediated superconductivity. Scaling of the relaxation rates among all of these materials ( a feature not exhibited by their Knight shifts) establishes antiferromagnetic fluctuations as a likely mechanism for their unconventional superconductivity and suggests that related classes of exotic superconductors may yet be discovered.","Los Alamos Natl Lab, Los Alamos, NM 87545 USA; Chonnam Natl Univ, Dept Phys, Kwangju 500757, South Korea","Curro, NJ (reprint author), Los Alamos Natl Lab, POB 1663, Los Alamos, NM 87545 USA.",curro@lanl.gov,"Bauer, Eric/D-7212-2011","Curro, Nicholas/0000-0001-7829-0237",,,,27,227,228,1,41,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,31-Mar,2005,434,7033,,,,,622,625,,10.1038/nature03428,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,911NN,WOS:000228011000039,15800618,No,,,11/20/17

Yet the fundamental cause of electronic and vibrational dynamics-the coupling between the different energy levels involved-is usually inferred only indirectly. Two-dimensional femtosecond infrared spectroscopy based on the heterodyne detection of three-pulse photon echoes(2-7) has recently allowed the direct mapping of vibrational couplings, yielding transient structural information. Here we extend the approach to the visible range(3,8) and directly measure electronic couplings in a molecular complex, the Fenna-Matthews-Olson photosynthetic light-harvesting protein(9,10). As in all photosynthetic systems, the conversion of light into chemical energy is driven by electronic couplings that ensure the efficient transport of energy from light-capturing antenna pigments to the reaction centre(11). We monitor this process as a function of time and frequency and show that excitation energy does not simply cascade stepwise down the energy ladder. We find instead distinct energy transport pathways that depend sensitively on the detailed spatial properties of the delocalized excited-state wavefunctions of the whole pigment-protein complex.","Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Chem, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; Univ Calif Berkeley, Inst Quantitat Biomed Res QB3, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; Univ Calif Berkeley, Lawrence Berkeley Lab, Phys Biosci Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; Korea Univ, Dept Chem, Seoul 136701, South Korea; Korea Univ, Div Chem & Mol Engn, Ctr Multidimens Spect, Seoul 136701, South Korea; Arizona State Univ, Dept Chem & Biochem, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA","Fleming, GR (reprint author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Chem, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",grfleming@lbl.gov,"Brixner, Tobias/S-1451-2016","Brixner, Tobias/0000-0002-6529-704X",,,,30,727,738,14,269,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,31-Mar,2005,434,7033,,,,,625,628,,10.1038/nature03429,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,911NN,WOS:000228011000040,15800619,No,,,11/20/17

Projections with climate models suggest that similar reorganizations may also occur in response to anthropogenic global warming(5-7). Here I use ensemble simulations with a coupled climate-ecosytem model of intermediate complexity to investigate the possible consequences of such disturbances to the marine ecosystem. In the simulations, a disruption of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation leads to a collapse of the North Atlantic plankton stocks to less than half of their initial biomass, owing to rapid shoaling of winter mixed layers and their associated separation from the deep ocean nutrient reservoir. Globally integrated export production declines by more than 20 per cent owing to reduced upwelling of nutrient-rich deep water and gradual depletion of upper ocean nutrient concentrations. These model results are consistent with the available high-resolution palaeorecord, and suggest that global ocean productivity is sensitive to changes in the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation.","Oregon State Univ, Coll Ocean & Atmospher Sci, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA","Schmittner, A (reprint author), Oregon State Univ, Coll Ocean & Atmospher Sci, 104 COAS Adm Bldg, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA.",aschmittner@coas.oregonstae.edu,"Schmittner, Andreas/A-3101-2008; Schmittner, Andreas/O-9647-2015","Schmittner, Andreas/0000-0002-8376-0843",,,,28,165,168,3,34,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,31-Mar,2005,434,7033,,,,,628,633,,10.1038/nature03476,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,911NN,WOS:000228011000041,15800620,No,,,11/20/17

Constraining core processes or mantle properties that induce or modulate reversals requires knowing the timing and morphology of field changes that precede and accompany these reversals(1-4). But the short duration of transitional field states and fragmentary nature of even the best palaeomagnetic records make it difficult to provide a timeline for the reversal process(1,5). Ar-40/Ar-39 dating of lavas on Tahiti, long thought to record the primary part of the most recent 'Matuyama-Brunhes' reversal, gives an age of 795 +/- 7 kyr, indistinguishable from that of lavas in Chile and La Palma that record a transition in the Earth's magnetic field, but older than the accepted age for the reversal. Only the 'transitional' lavas on Maui and one from La Palma (dated at 776 +/- 2 kyr), agree with the astronomical age for the reversal. Here we propose that the older lavas record the onset of a geodynamo process, which only on occasion would result in polarity change. This initial instability, associated with the first of two decreases in field intensity, began similar to 18 kyr before the actual polarity switch. These data support the claim(6) that complete reversals require a significant period for magnetic flux to escape from the solid inner core and sufficiently weaken its stabilizing effect(7).","Univ Wisconsin, Dept Geol & Geophys, Madison, WI 53706 USA; Calif Polytech State Univ San Luis Obispo, Dept Phys, San Luis Obispo, CA 93407 USA; Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Earth Sci, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA; Univ Massachusetts, Dept Geosci, Amherst, MA 01003 USA; MIT, Dept Earth Atmospher & Planetary Sci, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; Geosci Rennes UMR CNRS, F-35042 Rennes, France","Singer, BS (reprint author), Univ Wisconsin, Dept Geol & Geophys, 1215 W Dayton St, Madison, WI 53706 USA.",bsinger@geology.wisc.edu,"Singer, Bradley/F-4991-2012","Singer, Bradley/0000-0003-3595-5168",,,,28,71,75,2,11,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,31-Mar,2005,434,7033,,,,,633,636,,10.1038/nature03431,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,911NN,WOS:000228011000042,15800621,No,,,11/20/17

Further, in organisms with unequal-sized gametes, the female transmits her genes at only half the rate of an asexual equivalent ( the twofold cost of sex)(2). Many modern theories that provide an explanation for the advantage of sex incorporate an idea originally proposed by Weismann more than 100 years ago: sex allows natural selection to proceed more effectively because it increases genetic variation(3-5). Here we test this hypothesis, which still lacks robust empirical support, with the use of experiments on yeast populations. Capitalizing on recent advances in the molecular biology of recombination in yeast, we produced by genetic manipulation strains that differed only in their capacity for sexual reproduction. We show that, as predicted by the theory, sex increases the rate of adaptation to a new harsh environment but has no measurable effect on fitness in a new benign environment where there is little selection.","Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, NERC, Ctr Populat Biol, Ascot SL5 7PY, Berks, England; Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Dept Biol Sci, Ascot SL5 7PY, Berks, England","Goddard, MR (reprint author), Univ Auckland, Sch Biol Sci, Private Bag 92019, Auckland 1, New Zealand.",m.goddard@auckland.ac.nz,,,,,,29,243,248,9,241,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,31-Mar,2005,434,7033,,,,,636,640,,10.1038/nature03405,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,911NN,WOS:000228011000043,15800622,No,,,11/20/17

To gain a deeper understanding of the mechanisms of circadian rhythm regulation in humans, we set out to identify mutations in human subjects leading to FASPS. We report here the identification of a missense mutation (T44A) in the human CKI delta gene, which results in FASPS. This mutant kinase has decreased enzymatic activity in vitro. Transgenic Drosophila carrying the human CKI delta-T44A gene showed a phenotype with lengthened circadian period. In contrast, transgenic mice carrying the same mutation have a shorter circadian period, a phenotype mimicking human FASPS.

Although disease initiation may be multifactorial, the cartilage destruction appears to be a result of uncontrolled proteolytic extracellular matrix destruction. A major component of the cartilage extracellular matrix is aggrecan, a proteoglycan that imparts compressive resistance to the tissue. Aggrecan is cleaved at a specific 'aggrecanase' site in human osteoarthritic cartilage(1-2); this cleavage can be performed by several members of ADAMTS family of metalloproteases(3-9). The relative contribution of individual ADAMTS proteases to cartilage destruction during osteoarthritis has not been resolved. Here we describe experiments with a genetically modified mouse in which the catalytic domain of ADAMTS5 (aggrecanase-2) was deleted. After surgically induced joint instability, there was significant reduction in the severity of cartilage destruction in the ADAMTS5 knockout mice compared with wild-type mice. This is the first report of a single gene deletion capable of abrogating the course of cartilage destruction in an animal model of osteoarthritis.

We therefore created mice lacking cyclophilin D (CypD), a protein considered to be involved in the mPT, to analyse its role in cell death. CypD-deficient mice were developmentally normal and showed no apparent anomalies, but CypD-deficient mitochondria did not undergo the cyclosporin A-sensitive mPT. CypD-deficient cells died normally in response to various apoptotic stimuli, but showed resistance to necrotic cell death induced by reactive oxygen species and Ca2+ overload.

Here we generated mice lacking Ppif and mice overexpressing cyclophilin D in the heart. Ppif null mice are protected from ischaemia/reperfusion-induced cell death in vivo, whereas cyclophilin D-overexpressing mice show mitochondrial swelling and spontaneous cell death. Mitochondria isolated from the livers, hearts and brains of Ppif null mice are resistant to mitochondrial swelling and permeability transition in vitro. Moreover, primary hepatocytes and fibroblasts isolated from Ppif null mice are largely protected from Ca2+-overload and oxidative stress-induced cell death. However, Bcl-2 family member-induced cell death does not depend on cyclophilin D, and Ppif null fibroblasts are not protected from staurosporine or tumour-necrosis factor-alpha-induced death.

Here we show the crystal structure of a Piwi protein from Archaeoglobus fulgidus (AfPiwi) in complex with a small interfering RNA (siRNA)-like duplex, which mimics the 5 ' end of a guide RNA strand bound to an overhanging target messenger RNA. The structure contains a highly conserved metal-binding site that anchors the 5 ' nucleotide of the guide RNA. The first base pair of the duplex is unwound, separating the 5 ' nucleotide of the guide from the complementary nucleotide on the target strand, which exits with the 3 ' overhang through a short channel. The remaining base-paired nucleotides assume an A-form helix, accommodated within a channel in the PIWI domain, which can be extended to place the scissile phosphate of the target strand adjacent to the putative slicer catalytic site. This study provides insights into mechanisms of target mRNA recognition and cleavage by an Argonaute-siRNA guide complex.","Inst Canc Res, Chester Beatty Labs, Sect Struct Biol, London SW3 6JB, England","Barford, D (reprint author), Inst Canc Res, Chester Beatty Labs, Sect Struct Biol, 237 Fulham Rd, London SW3 6JB, England.",david.barford@icr.ac.uk,,,Wellcome Trust [074543],,,30,304,323,0,25,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,31-Mar,2005,434,7033,,,,,663,666,,10.1038/nature03462,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,911NN,WOS:000228011000049,15800628,No,,,11/20/17

The PIWI domain, a highly conserved motif within Argonaute, has been shown to adopt an RNase H fold(4,5) critical for the endonuclease cleavage activity of RISC4-6. Here we report the crystal structure of Archaeoglobus fulgidus Piwi protein bound to double-stranded RNA, thereby identifying the binding pocket for guide-strand 5 '-end recognition and providing insight into guide-strand-mediated messenger RNA target recognition. The phosphorylated 5 ' end of the guide RNA is anchored within a highly conserved basic pocket, supplemented by the carboxy-terminal carboxylate and a bound divalent cation. The first nucleotide from the 5 ' end of the guide RNA is unpaired and stacks over a conserved tyrosine residue, whereas successive nucleotides form a four-base-pair RNA duplex. Mutation of the corresponding amino acids that contact the 5 ' phosphate in human Ago2 resulted in attenuated mRNA cleavage activity. Our structure of the Piwi-RNA complex, and that determined elsewhere(7), provide direct support for the 5 ' region of the guide RNA serving as a nucleation site for pairing with target mRNA and for a fixed distance separating the RISC-mediated mRNA cleavage site from the anchored 5 ' end of the guide RNA.","Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Struct Biol Program, New York, NY 10021 USA; Rockefeller Univ, Lab RNA Mol Biol, New York, NY 10021 USA","Patel, DJ (reprint author), Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Struct Biol Program, 1275 York Ave, New York, NY 10021 USA.",pateld@mskcc.org,"Pei, Yi/D-8998-2011","Pei, Yi/0000-0002-3466-760X",NCI NIH HHS [P30 CA008748]; NIAID NIH HHS [R01 AI068776],,,29,381,409,5,31,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,31-Mar,2005,434,7033,,,,,666,670,,10.1038/nature03514,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,911NN,WOS:000228011000050,15800629,No,,,11/20/17

They are vital for cell proliferation(1-3) and are a target for poisoning by anti-cancer drugs(4,5). Type IB topoisomerase (TopIB) forms a protein clamp around the DNA duplex(6-8) and creates a transient nick that permits removal of supercoils. Using real-time single-molecule observation, we show that TopIB releases supercoils by a swivel mechanism that involves friction between the rotating DNA and the enzyme cavity: that is, the DNA does not freely rotate. Unlike a nicking enzyme, TopIB does not release all the supercoils at once, but it typically does so in multiple steps. The number of supercoils removed per step follows an exponential distribution. The enzyme is found to be torque-sensitive, as the mean number of supercoils per step increases with the torque stored in the DNA. We propose a model for topoisomerization in which the torque drives the DNA rotation over a rugged periodic energy landscape in which the topoisomerase has a small but quantifiable probability to religate the DNA once per turn.","Delft Univ Technol, Fac Sci Appl, Kavli Inst Nanosci, NL-2628 CJ Delft, Netherlands; Ecole Normale Super, Lab Phys Stat, F-75005 Paris, France; Sloan Kettering Inst, Program Mol Biol, New York, NY 10021 USA","Dekker, NH (reprint author), Delft Univ Technol, Fac Sci Appl, Kavli Inst Nanosci, Lorentzweg 1, NL-2628 CJ Delft, Netherlands.",nynke.dekker@mb.tn.tudelft.nl,,"Dekker, Cees/0000-0001-6273-071X; Dekker, Nynke/0000-0003-4029-0973; Croquette, Vincent/0000-0003-1400-0039",,,,29,197,202,1,33,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,31-Mar,2005,434,7033,,,,,671,674,,10.1038/nature03395,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,911NN,WOS:000228011000051,15800630,No,,,11/20/17

Using recordings from a hydroacoustic array deployed by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, we show here that East Pacific Rise transform faults also have a low number of aftershocks and high foreshock rates compared to continental strike-slip faults. The high ratio of foreshocks to aftershocks implies that such transform-fault seismicity cannot be explained by seismic triggering models in which there is no fundamental distinction between foreshocks, mainshocks and aftershocks. The foreshock sequences on East Pacific Rise transform faults can be used to predict ( retrospectively) earthquakes of magnitude 5.4 or greater, in narrow spatial and temporal windows and with a high probability gain. The predictability of such transform earthquakes is consistent with a model in which slow slip transients trigger earthquakes, enrich their low-frequency radiation and accommodate much of the aseismic plate motion.","Woods Hole Oceanog Inst, Dept Geol & Geophys, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA; MIT Woods Hole Oceanog Inst Joint Program, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA; Univ So Calif, Dept Earth Sci, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA","McGuire, JJ (reprint author), Woods Hole Oceanog Inst, Dept Geol & Geophys, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA.",jmcguire@whoi.edu,"Wright, Dawn/A-4518-2011","Wright, Dawn/0000-0002-2997-7611; Boettcher, Margaret/0000-0002-5031-7116",,,,43,82,84,1,24,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,24-Mar,2005,434,7032,,,,,457,461,,10.1038/nature03377,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,909CH,WOS:000227836000031,15791246,No,,,11/20/17

We used RNA-mediated interference to target 98% of all genes predicted in the C. elegans genome in combination with differential interference contrast time-lapse microscopy.

In both males and females, urine volatile compounds evoke robust responses in a small subset of mitral cells. Fractionation of the volatile compounds using gas chromatography showed that out of the hundreds of compounds present, mitral cells are activated by single compounds. One cohort of mitral cells responded exclusively to male urine; these neurons were activated by ( methylthio) methanethiol, a potent, previously unknown semiochemical present only in male urine. When added to urine, synthetic ( methylthio) methanethiol significantly enhances urine attractiveness to female mice.

The regions around the dark filaments are often bright in X-rays and are associated with jets(4-6). This implies plasma heating and acceleration, which are important for coronal heating. Previous two-dimensional simulations of such regions showed that magnetic reconnection between the coronal magnetic field and the emerging flux produced X-ray jets and flares, but left unresolved the origin of filamentary structure and the intermittent nature of the heating. Here we report three-dimensional simulations of emerging flux showing that the filamentary structure arises spontaneously from the magnetic Rayleigh - Taylor instability(7,8), contrary to the previous view that the dark filaments are isolated bundles of magnetic field that rise from the photosphere carrying the dense gas(9-11). As a result of the magnetic Rayleigh - Taylor instability, thin current sheets are formed in the emerging flux, and magnetic reconnection occurs between emerging flux and the pre-existing coronal field in a spatially intermittent way. This explains naturally the intermittent nature of coronal heating and the patchy brightenings in solar flares.","Kyoto Univ, Kwasan Observ, Kyoto 6078471, Japan; Kyoto Univ, Hida Observ, Kyoto 6078471, Japan; Univ Tokyo, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo 1130033, Japan","Isobe, H (reprint author), Kyoto Univ, Kwasan Observ, Kyoto 6078471, Japan.",isobe@kwasan.kyoto-u.ac.jp,"Yokoyama, Takaaki/B-9315-2008","Yokoyama, Takaaki/0000-0001-5457-4999",,,,25,106,106,0,7,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,24-Mar,2005,434,7032,,,,,478,481,,10.1038/nature03399,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,909CH,WOS:000227836000034,15791248,No,,,11/20/17

Spatial HBT interferometry has been suggested(7) as a means to probe hidden order in strongly correlated phases of ultracold atoms. Here we report such a measurement on the Mott insulator(8-10) phase of a rubidium Bose gas as it is released from an optical lattice trap. We show that strong periodic quantum correlations exist between density fluctuations in the expanding atom cloud. These spatial correlations reflect the underlying ordering in the lattice, and find a natural interpretation in terms of a multiplewave HBT interference effect.

Artificial single-impurity Kondo systems have been realized in various nanostructures, including semiconductor quantum dots(2-4), carbon nanotubes(5,6) and individual molecules(7,8). The Kondo effect is usually regarded as a spin-related phenomenon, namely the coherent exchange of the spin between a localized state and a Fermi sea of delocalized electrons. In principle, however, the role of the spin could be replaced by other degrees of freedom, such as an orbital quantum number(9,10). Here we show that the unique electronic structure of carbon nanotubes enables the observation of a purely orbital Kondo effect. We use a magnetic field to tune spin-polarized states into orbital degeneracy and conclude that the orbital quantum number is conserved during tunnelling. When orbital and spin degeneracies are present simultaneously, we observe a strongly enhanced Kondo effect, with a multiple splitting of the Kondo resonance at finite field and predicted to obey a so-called SU(4) symmetry.","Delft Univ Technol, Kavli Inst Nanosci, NL-2600 GA Delft, Netherlands","Jarillo-Herrero, P (reprint author), Delft Univ Technol, Kavli Inst Nanosci, POB 5046, NL-2600 GA Delft, Netherlands.",pablo@qt.tn.tudelft.nl,"van der Zant, Herre/J-9467-2016","van der Zant, Herre/0000-0002-5385-0282; Dekker, Cees/0000-0001-6273-071X",,,,30,247,247,2,67,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,24-Mar,2005,434,7032,,,,,484,488,,10.1038/nature03422,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,909CH,WOS:000227836000036,15791250,No,,,11/20/17

This hypothesis has inspired models that depend on the Earth's obliquity (similar to 40,000 yr; similar to 40 kyr), orbital eccentricity (similar to 100 kyr) and precessional (similar to 20 kyr) fluctuations(2-5), with the emphasis usually on eccentricity and precessional forcing. According to a contrasting hypothesis, the glacial cycles arise primarily because of random internal climate variability(6-8). Taking these two perspectives together, there are currently more than thirty different models of the seven late-Pleistocene glacial cycles(9). Here we present a statistical test of the orbital forcing hypothesis, focusing on the rapid deglaciation events known as terminations(10,11). According to our analysis, the null hypothesis that glacial terminations are independent of obliquity can be rejected at the 5% significance level, whereas the corresponding null hypotheses for eccentricity and precession cannot be rejected. The simplest inference consistent with the test results is that the ice sheets terminated every second or third obliquity cycle at times of high obliquity, similar to the original proposal by Milankovitch(12). We also present simple stochastic and deterministic models that describe the timing of the late-Pleistocene glacial terminations purely in terms of obliquity forcing.","Woods Hole Oceanog Inst, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA; MIT, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA","Huybers, P (reprint author), Woods Hole Oceanog Inst, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA.",phuybers@whoi.edu,,,,,,30,148,156,1,58,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,24-Mar,2005,434,7032,,,,,491,494,,10.1038/nature03401,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,909CH,WOS:000227836000038,15791252,No,,,11/20/17

We present here a biomarker stratigraphic record showing episodic microbial changes coupled with a high-resolution record of invertebrate mass extinction. Variation in the microbial community structure is characterized by the 2-methylhopane (2-MHP) index ( a ratio of the abundance of cyanobacterial biomarkers to more general bacterial biomarkers). Two episodes of faunal mass extinction were each preceded by minima in the 2-MHP index, followed by strong maxima, likely reflecting microbial responses to the catastrophic events that caused the extinction and initiated ecosystem changes. Hence, both cyanobacterial biomarker and invertebrate fossil records provide evidence for two episodes of biotic crisis across the P/Tr boundary.","Univ Bristol, Sch Chem, Organ Geochem Unit, Bristol Biogeochem Ctr, Bristol BS8 1TS, Avon, England; China Univ Geosci, Fac Earth Sci, Wuhan 430074, Peoples R China; China Univ Geosci, State Key Lab Geol Proc & Mineral Resources, Wuhan 430074, Peoples R China; China Univ Geosci, Sch Environm Studies, Wuhan 430074, Peoples R China","Pancost, RD (reprint author), Univ Bristol, Sch Chem, Organ Geochem Unit, Bristol Biogeochem Ctr, Cantocks Close, Bristol BS8 1TS, Avon, England.",r.d.pancost@bristol.ac.uk,"Xie, Shucheng/E-6713-2011","Pancost, Richard/0000-0003-0298-4026",,,,28,198,261,14,95,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,24-Mar,2005,434,7032,,,,,494,497,,10.1038/nature03396,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,909CH,WOS:000227836000039,15791253,No,,,11/20/17

Macroscelidea is one of several morphologically diverse but predominantly African placental orders classified in the superorder Afrotheria by molecular phylogeneticists(3,4). The distribution of modern afrotheres, in combination with a basal position for Afrotheria within Placentalia and molecular divergence-time estimates, has been used to link placental diversification with the mid-Cretaceous separation of South America and Africa(4). Morphological phylogenetic analyses do not support Afrotheria(5-7) and the fossil record favours a northern origin of Placentalia(8). Here we describe fossil postcrania that provide evidence for a close relationship between North American Palaeocene Eocene apheliscine 'hyopsodontid' ` condylarths' ( early ungulates or hoofed mammals) and extant Macroscelidea. Apheliscine postcranial morphology is consistent with a relationship to other ungulate-like afrotheres (Hyracoidea, Proboscidea) but does not provide support for a monophyletic Afrotheria. As the oldest record of an afrothere clade, identification of macroscelidean relatives in the North American Palaeocene argues against an African origin for Afrotheria, weakening support for linking placental diversification to the break-up of Gondwana.","Johns Hopkins Univ, Sch Med, Ctr Funct Anat & Evolut, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA; Univ Florida, Florida Museum Nat Hist, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA","Zack, SP (reprint author), Johns Hopkins Univ, Sch Med, Ctr Funct Anat & Evolut, 1830 E Monument St, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA.",szack1@jhem.jhmi.edu,,"Bloch, Jonathan/0000-0003-1484-6931",,,,30,67,73,2,9,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,24-Mar,2005,434,7032,,,,,497,501,,10.1038/nature03351,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,909CH,WOS:000227836000040,15791254,No,,,11/20/17

The chase-away model(5) emphasizes sexual conflict: male signals attract females because they exploit receiver biases(6-9). As males gain control of mating decisions, females may experience fitness costs through suboptimal mating rates or post-copulatory exploitation. Elaboration of male signals is expected if females increase their response threshold to resist such exploitation. If ornaments target otherwise adaptive biases such as feeding responses(8-10), selection on females might eventually separate sexual and non-sexual responses to the signal. Here we show that the terminal yellow band (TYB) of several Goodeinae species evokes both feeding and sexual responses; sexual responsiveness phylogenetically pre-dates the expression of the TYB in males and is comparable across taxa, yet feeding responsiveness decreases in species with more elaborated TYBs. Displaying a TYB is costly, and thus provides an example where a trait arose as a sensory trap but has evolved into an honest signal.","Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Dept Ecol Evolut, Inst Ecol, Mexico City 04510, DF, Mexico","Garcia, CM (reprint author), Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Dept Ecol Evolut, Inst Ecol, AP 70-275, Mexico City 04510, DF, Mexico.",maciasg@servidor.unam.mx,"Macias Garcia, Constantino /A-9399-2010","Macias Garcia, Constantino /0000-0003-3242-4214",,,,26,61,63,1,127,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,24-Mar,2005,434,7032,,,,,501,505,,10.1038/nature03363,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,909CH,WOS:000227836000041,15791255,No,,,11/20/17

Here we show that Arabidopsis plants homozygous for recessive mutant alleles of the organ fusion gene HOTHEAD(5) (HTH) can inherit allele-specific DNA sequence information that was not present in the chromosomal genome of their parents but was present in previous generations. This previously undescribed process is shown to occur at all DNA sequence polymorphisms examined and therefore seems to be a general mechanism for extragenomic inheritance of DNA sequence information. We postulate that these genetic restoration events are the result of a template-directed process that makes use of an ancestral RNA-sequence cache.","Purdue Univ, Dept Bot & Plant Pathol, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA","Pruitt, RE (reprint author), Purdue Univ, Dept Bot & Plant Pathol, 915 W State St, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA.",pruittr@purdue.edu,,,,,,30,130,137,1,86,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,24-Mar,2005,434,7032,,,,,505,509,,10.1038/nature03380,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,909CH,WOS:000227836000042,15785770,No,,,11/20/17

The fossil record indicates that these primitive plants had branched stems with sporangia but no leaves. Leaf-like lateral outgrowths subsequently evolved on at least two independent occasions(2-4). In extant plants, these events are represented by microphyllous leaves in lycophytes (clubmosses, spikemosses and quillworts) and megaphyllous leaves in euphyllophytes ( ferns, gymnosperms and angiosperms). Our current understanding of how leaves develop is restricted to processes that operate during megaphyll formation. Because microphylls and megaphylls evolved independently, different mechanisms might be required for leaf formation. Here we show that this is not so. Gene expression data from a microphyllous lycophyte, phylogenetic analyses, and a cross-species complementation experiment all show that a common developmental mechanism can underpin both microphyll and megaphyll formation. We propose that this mechanism might have operated originally in the context of primitive plant apices to facilitate bifurcation. Recruitment of this pathway to formleaves occurred independently and in parallel in different plant lineages.","Univ Oxford, Dept Plant Sci, Oxford OX1 3RB, England","Langdale, JA (reprint author), Univ Oxford, Dept Plant Sci, S Parks Rd, Oxford OX1 3RB, England.",jane.langdale@plants.ox.ac.uk,,,,,,30,118,123,2,37,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,24-Mar,2005,434,7032,,,,,509,514,,10.1038/nature03410,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,909CH,WOS:000227836000043,15791256,No,,,11/20/17

Sympathetic signalling via beta 2-adrenergic receptors (Adrb2) present on osteoblasts controls bone formation downstream of leptin(1). Here we show, by analysing Adrb2-deficient mice, that the sympathetic nervous system favours bone resorption by increasing expression in osteoblast progenitor cells of the osteoclast differentiation factor Rankl. This sympathetic function requires phosphorylation ( by protein kinase A) of ATF4, a cell-specific CREB-related transcription factor essential for osteoblast differentiation and function(2). That bone resorption cannot increase in gonadectomized Adrb2-deficient mice highlights the biological importance of this regulation, but also contrasts sharply with the increase in bone resorption characterizing another hypogonadic mouse with low sympathetic tone, the ob/ob mouse(3). This discrepancy is explained, in part, by the fact that CART ('cocaine amphetamine regulated transcript'), a neuropeptide whose expression is controlled by leptin and nearly abolished in ob/ob mice(4), inhibits bone resorption by modulating Rankl expression. Our study establishes that leptin-regulated neural pathways control both aspects of bone remodelling, and demonstrates that integrity of sympathetic signalling is necessary for the increase in bone resorption caused by gonadal failure.","Baylor Coll Med, Dept Mol & Human Genet, Houston, TX 77030 USA; Baylor Coll Med, Bone Dis Program Texas, Houston, TX 77030 USA; Baylor Coll Med, Childrens Nutr Res Ctr, Houston, TX 77030 USA; Tokyo Med & Dent Univ, Dept Orthoped, Tokyo 1010062, Japan; Tokyo Med & Dent Univ, Ctr Excellence Program Frontier Res Mol Destruct, Tokyo 1010062, Japan; Tokyo Med & Dent Univ, Dept Mol Pharmacol, Med Res Inst, Tokyo 1010062, Japan; Amgen Inc, Neurosci, Thousand Oaks, CA 91320 USA; CHRU Pitie Salpetriere, Hotel Dieu, Dept Nutr, F-75004 Paris, France; Univ Paris 06, INSERM, Avenir Team, EA3502, F-75004 Paris, France; Univ Calif San Francisco, Ctr Diabet, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Med, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA","Karsenty, G (reprint author), Baylor Coll Med, Dept Mol & Human Genet, Houston, TX 77030 USA.",karsenty@bcm.tmc.edu,"Vaisse, Christian/F-1067-2011; takeda, shu/B-5195-2012; Clement, karine/R-1120-2017",,NIDDK NIH HHS [R01 DK060540],,,18,668,715,1,27,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,24-Mar,2005,434,7032,,,,,514,520,,10.1038/nature03398,,7,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,909CH,WOS:000227836000044,15724149,No,,,11/20/17

Here we show that most mouse and human NKT cells recognize glycosphingolipids from Sphingomonas, Gram-negative bacteria that do not contain lipopolysaccharide(3-5). NKT cells are activated in vivo after exposure to these bacterial antigens or bacteria, and mice that lack NKT cells have a marked defect in the clearance of Sphingomonas from the liver. These data suggest that NKT cells are T lymphocytes that provide an innate-type immune response to certain microorganisms through recognition by their antigen receptor, and that they might be useful in providing protection from bacteria that cannot be detected by pattern recognition receptors such as Toll-like receptor 4.","La Jolla Inst Allergy & Immunol, Div Dev Immunol, San Diego, CA 92121 USA; Scripps Res Inst, Dept Chem, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; Scripps Res Inst, Skaggs Inst Chem Biol, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; NYU, Sch Med, Dept Med, Div Gastroenterol, New York, NY 10016 USA; Rockefeller Univ, Aaron Diamond AIDS Res Ctr, New York, NY 10016 USA; NYU, Sch Med, Dept Med & Mol Parasitol, New York, NY 10010 USA; Kitasato Inst, Minato Ku, Tokyo 1088642, Japan","Kronenberg, M (reprint author), La Jolla Inst Allergy & Immunol, Div Dev Immunol, 10355 Sci Ctr Dr, San Diego, CA 92121 USA.",mitch@liai.org,"Tsuji, Moriya/B-1471-2008","Poles, Michael/0000-0002-7993-6156; Tsuji, Moriya/0000-0001-8587-277X",,,,30,645,662,3,31,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,24-Mar,2005,434,7032,,,,,520,525,,10.1038/nature03407,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,909CH,WOS:000227836000045,15791257,No,,,11/20/17

We have identified glycosylceramides from the cell wall of Sphingomonas that serve as direct targets for mouse and human NKT cells, controlling both septic shock reaction and bacterial clearance in infected mice. In contrast, Gram-negative, LPS-positive Salmonella typhimurium activates NKT cells through the recognition of an endogenous lysosomal glycosphingolipid, iGb3, presented by LPS-activated dendritic cells. These findings identify two novel antigenic targets of NKT cells in antimicrobial defence, and show that glycosylceramides are an alternative to LPS for innate recognition of the Gram-negative, LPS-negative bacterial cell wall.","Univ Chicago, Comm Immunol, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; Univ Chicago, Comm Microbiol, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; Univ Texas, Med Branch, Dept Pathol, Galveston, TX 77555 USA; Brigham Young Univ, Dept Chem & Biochem, Provo, UT 84602 USA; Scripps Res Inst, Dept Immunol, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA","Savage, PB (reprint author), Univ Chicago, Comm Immunol, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.",paul_savage@byu.edu; abendela@bsd.uchicago.edu,"Yin, NIng/C-8991-2011; Zhou, Dapeng/D-3059-2014","Zhou, Dapeng/0000-0003-1347-3811; Hoebe, Kasper/0000-0002-3626-8098",,,,24,774,795,1,33,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,24-Mar,2005,434,7032,,,,,525,529,,10.1038/nature03408,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,909CH,WOS:000227836000046,15791258,No,,,11/20/17

Meiosis consists of the first (MI) and the second (MII) meiotic divisions, which occur consecutively. MI is reductional, in which homologous chromosomes derived from parents segregate. MI is supported by an elaborate mechanism involving meiosis-specific cohesin and its protector(1). MII is equational, in which replicated sister-chromatids separate as in mitosis. MII is generally considered to mimic mitosis in mechanism. However, fission yeastMes1p is essential for MII but dispensable for mitosis. The mes1-B44 mutant arrests before MII2. Transcription of mes1 is low in vegetative cells and boosted in a narrow window between late MI and late MII3. The mes1 mRNA undergoes meiosis-specific splicing(4). Here we show that Mes1p is a factor that suppresses the degradation of cyclin Cdc13p at anaphase I. Mes1p binds to Slp1p, an activator of APC/C ( anaphase promoting complex/cyclosome), and counteracts its function to engage Cdc13p in proteolysis. Inhibition of APC/C-dependent degradation of Cdc13p by Mes1p was reproduced in a Xenopus egg extract. We therefore propose that Mes1p has a key function in saving a sufficient level of MPF ( M-phase-promoting factor) activity required for the execution of MII.","Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Sci, Dept Biophys & Biochem, Tokyo 1130033, Japan; Univ Tokyo, Mol Genet Res Lab, Tokyo 1130033, Japan; Natl Inst Basic Biol, Dept Cell Proliferat, Okazaki, Aichi 4440867, Japan; Marie Curie Res Inst, Cell Cycle Control Grp, Surrey RH8 0TL, England","Yamamoto, M (reprint author), Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Sci, Dept Biophys & Biochem, Tokyo 1130033, Japan.",myamamot@ims.u-tokyo.ac.jp,"Yamashita, Akira/A-5278-2015","Yamashita, Akira/0000-0002-1805-1434",,,,30,51,55,0,2,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,24-Mar,2005,434,7032,,,,,529,533,,10.1038/nature03406,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,909CH,WOS:000227836000047,15791259,No,,,11/20/17

In Drosophila, PcG and trxG proteins associate with DNA regions named Polycomb and trithorax response elements (PRE and TRE), but the mechanisms of recruitment are unknown. We previously characterized a minimal element from the regulatory region of the Abdominal-B gene, termed Ab-Fab. Ab-Fab contains a PRE and a TRE and is able to maintain repressed or active chromatin states during development(2). Here we show that the Dorsal switch protein 1 (DSP1), a Drosophila HMGB2 homologue, binds to a sequence present within Ab-Fab and in other characterized PREs. Addition of this motif to an artificial sequence containing Pleiohomeotic and GAGA factor consensus sites is sufficient for PcG protein recruitment in vivo. Mutations that abolish DSP1 binding to Ab-Fab and to a PRE from the engrailed locus lead to loss of PcG protein binding, loss of silencing, and switching of these PREs into constitutive TREs. The binding of DSP1 to PREs is therefore important for the recruitment of PcG proteins.","CNRS, Inst Human Genet, F-34396 Montpellier, France; Univ Orleans, CNRS, Ctr Biophys Mol, F-45071 Orleans, France","Cavalli, G (reprint author), CNRS, Inst Human Genet, 141 Rue Cardonille, F-34396 Montpellier, France.",giacomo.cavalli@igh.cnrs.fr,"Cavalli, Giacomo/A-7958-2008","Cavalli, Giacomo/0000-0003-3709-3469; Cuvier, Olivier/0000-0003-0644-2734",,,,29,106,109,0,5,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,24-Mar,2005,434,7032,,,,,533,538,,10.1038/nature03386,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,909CH,WOS:000227836000048,15791260,No,,,11/20/17

We have determined 99.3% of the euchromatic sequence of the X chromosome. Our analysis illustrates the autosomal origin of the mammalian sex chromosomes, the stepwise process that led to the progressive loss of recombination between X and Y, and the extent of subsequent degradation of the Y chromosome. LINE1 repeat elements cover one-third of the X chromosome, with a distribution that is consistent with their proposed role as way stations in the process of X-chromosome inactivation. We found 1,098 genes in the sequence, of which 99 encode proteins expressed in testis and in various tumour types. A disproportionately high number of mendelian diseases are documented for the X chromosome. Of this number, 168 have been explained by mutations in 113 X-linked genes, which in many cases were characterized with the aid of the DNA sequence.","Wellcome Trust Sanger Inst, Cambridge CB10 1SA, England; Baylor Coll Med, Human Genome Sequencing Ctr, Dept Mol & Human Genet, Houston, TX 77030 USA; Inst Mol Biotechnol, D-07745 Jena, Germany; Washington Univ, Genome Sequencing Ctr, St Louis, MO 63108 USA; Max Planck Inst Mol Genet, D-14195 Berlin, Germany; Univ Kiel, Inst Clin Mol Biol, D-24105 Kiel, Germany; Univ Munich, D-80336 Munich, Germany; UCL, Galton Lab, HUGO Gen Nomenclature Comm, Dept Biol, London NW1 2HE, England; Penn State Coll Med, Dept Biochem & Mol Biol, Hershey, PA 17033 USA; PE Appl Biosyst, Adv Ctr Genet Technol, Foster City, CA 94404 USA; European Bioinformat Inst, Cambridge CB10 1SD, England; Inst Genet & Biophys, I-80100 Naples, Italy; Univ Edinburgh, Western Gen Hosp, Med Genet Sect, Edinburgh EH4 2XU, Midlothian, Scotland; Univ Paris 05, INSERM, U567,Inst Cochin, Lab Genet & Physiopathol Retards Mentaux, F-75014 Paris, France; Childrens Hosp Oakland, Res Inst, Oakland, CA 94609 USA; Deutsch Krebsforschungszentrum, D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany; GSF, Natl Res Ctr Environm Hlth, Inst Human Genet, D-85764 Neuherberg, Germany; RZPD Resource Ctr Genome Res, D-14059 Berlin, Germany; NHGRI, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; NIA, Genet Lab, Baltimore, MD 21224 USA; Duke Univ, Inst Genome Sci & Policy, Durham, NC 27708 USA","Ross, MT (reprint author), Wellcome Trust Sanger Inst, Wellcome Trust Genome Campus, Cambridge CB10 1SA, England.",mtr@sanger.ac.uk,"Francis, Fiona/B-5854-2016; Hubbard, Tim/C-2567-2008; Frankish, Adam/G-6545-2011; Evans, Kathryn /I-5910-2012; Johnson, David/A-3907-2011; Norouzi, Neil/H-2530-2012; Glockner, Gernot/A-7800-2010; Meitinger, Thomas/O-1318-2015","Wilming, Laurens/0000-0002-4154-7358; Gilbert, James/0000-0001-8079-3159; Andrews, Dan/0000-0003-3922-6376; Trevanion, Stephen/0000-0002-4862-3333; Keenan, Stephen/0000-0002-9141-7690; Hubbard, Tim/0000-0002-1767-9318; Johnson, David/0000-0003-0887-3343; Glockner, Gernot/0000-0002-9061-1061; Hunt, Adrienne/0000-0002-1227-0310; Bridgeman, Anne/0000-0002-9478-6125; Hunt, Sarah/0000-0002-8350-1235; Davidson, Claire/0000-0002-4910-8202; Meitinger, Thomas/0000-0002-8838-8403; Howe, Kevin/0000-0002-1751-9226; Bruford, Elspeth/0000-0002-8380-5247; Durbin, Richard/0000-0002-9130-1006; Loveland, Jane/0000-0002-7669-2934; Fosker, Christine/0000-0002-3799-9474; Francis, Fiona/0000-0001-8542-7537; Delgado, Oliver/0000-0003-2547-5857; BALLABIO, Andrea/0000-0003-1381-4604",NHGRI NIH HHS [U54 HG003273],,,67,586,1337,2,75,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,17-Mar,2005,434,7031,,,,,325,337,,10.1038/nature03440,,13,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,907KG,WOS:000227715100040,15772651,No,,,11/20/17

Here, we present a comparative analysis of the human, mouse, rat and dog genomes to create a systematic catalogue of common regulatory motifs in promoters and 30 untranslated regions ( 3 0 UTRs). The promoter analysis yields 174 candidate motifs, including most previously known transcription-factor binding sites and 105 new motifs. The 3'-UTR analysis yields 106 motifs likely to be involved in post-transcriptional regulation. Nearly one-half are associated with microRNAs ( miRNAs), leading to the discovery of many new miRNA genes and their likely target genes. Our results suggest that previous estimates of the number of human miRNA genes were low, and that miRNAs regulate at least 20% of human genes. The overall results provide a systematic view of gene regulation in the human, which will be refined as additional mammalian genomes become available.","MIT, Broad Inst, Cambridge, MA 02141 USA; Harvard, Broad Inst, Cambridge, MA 02141 USA; MIT, Whitehead Inst Biomed Res, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; MIT, Comp Sci & Artificial Intelligence Lab, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA","Lander, ES (reprint author), MIT, Broad Inst, Cambridge, MA 02141 USA.",lander@broad.mit.edu; manoli@mit.edu,,,"NHGRI NIH HHS [R01 HG004037-01A1, R01 HG004037]",,,37,1283,1410,3,73,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,17-Mar,2005,434,7031,,,,,338,345,,10.1038/nature03441,,8,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,907KG,WOS:000227715100041,15735639,No,,,11/20/17

Together with new evidence for recent ice-rich rock glaciers at the base of the Olympus Mons scarp superposed on larger Late Amazonian debris-covered piedmont glaciers, we interpret these deposits as evidence for geologically recent and recurring glacial activity in tropical and mid-latitude regions of Mars during periods of increased spin-axis obliquity when polar ice was mobilized and redeposited in microenvironments at lower latitudes. The data indicate that abundant residual ice probably remains in these deposits and that these records of geologically recent climate changes are accessible to future automated and human surface exploration.","Brown Univ, Dept Geol Sci, Providence, RI 02912 USA; Free Univ Berlin, Inst Geol Wissensch, D-12249 Berlin, Germany; DLR, Inst Planetenforsch, D-12489 Berlin, Germany; US Geol Survey, Menlo Pk, CA 94025 USA; Orsay Terre, F-91405 Orsay, France; ESTEC, SCISR, NL-2200 AG Noordwijk, Netherlands","Head, JW (reprint author), Brown Univ, Dept Geol Sci, Providence, RI 02912 USA.",james_head@brown.edu,"Werner, Stephanie/A-6438-2012; Kreslavsky, Mikhail/J-3425-2013; van Gasselt, Stephan/L-9762-2013","Werner, Stephanie/0000-0001-5704-0909; van Gasselt, Stephan/0000-0003-2130-6343; Kreslavsky, Mikhail/0000-0002-1900-826X",,,,38,195,197,0,34,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,17-Mar,2005,434,7031,,,,,346,351,,10.1038/nature03359,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,907KG,WOS:000227715100042,15772652,No,,,11/20/17

Evidence for the resulting lava plains has been identified in eastern Elysium(1,2,4,6 - 8), but seas and lakes from these fissures and previous water flooding events were presumed to have evaporated and sublimed away(9-11). Here we present High Resolution Stereo Camera images from the European Space Agency Mars Express spacecraft that indicate that such lakes may still exist. We infer that the evidence is consistent with a frozen body of water, with surface pack-ice, around 5 degrees north latitude and 150 degrees east longitude in southern Elysium.

Here we present new image and topographic data from the High Resolution Stereo Camera that reveal previously unknown traces of an explosive eruption at 30 degrees N and 149 degrees E on the northwestern flank of the shield volcano Hecates Tholus. The eruption created a large, 10-km-diameter caldera similar to 350 million years ago. We interpret these observations to mean that large-scale explosive volcanism on Mars was not confined to the planet's early evolution. We also show that glacial deposits partly fill the caldera and an adjacent depression. Their age, derived from crater counts, is about 5 to 24 million years. Climate models predict that near-surface ice is not stable at mid-latitudes today(6), assuming a thermo-dynamic steady state. Therefore, the discovery of very young glacial features at Hecates Tholus suggests recent climate changes.

Almost all current measurements involve measuring the voltage drop across a resistor, using Ohm's law, in which the discrete nature of charge does not come into play. However, by sending a direct current through a microelectronic circuit with a chain of islands connected by small tunnel junctions, the individual electrons can be observed one by one. The quantum mechanical tunnelling of single charges in this one-dimensional array is time correlated(1-3), and consequently the detected signal has the average frequency f = I/e, where I is the current and e is the electron charge. Here we report a direct observation of these time-correlated single-electron tunnelling oscillations, and show electron counting in the range 5 fA - 1 pA. This represents a fundamentally new way to measure extremely small currents, without offset or drift. Moreover, our current measurement, which is based on electron counting, is self-calibrated, as the measured which is based on electron counting, is self-calibrated, as the measured frequency is related to the current only by a natural constant.","Chalmers, Dept Microtechnol & Nanosci MC2, SE-41296 Gothenburg, Sweden","Bylander, J (reprint author), Chalmers, Dept Microtechnol & Nanosci MC2, SE-41296 Gothenburg, Sweden.",jonas.bylander@mc2.chalmers.se,"Bylander, Jonas/A-4636-2011; Duty, Timothy/B-4747-2010; Delsing, Per/F-7288-2010","Bylander, Jonas/0000-0003-4521-710X; Duty, Timothy/0000-0003-1903-3745; Delsing, Per/0000-0002-1222-3506",,,,31,163,163,5,29,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,17-Mar,2005,434,7031,,,,,361,364,,10.1038/nature03375,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,907KG,WOS:000227715100045,15772655,No,,,11/20/17

In particular, the simultaneous occurrence of ferromagnetism and ferroelectricity, combined with an intimate coupling of magnetization and polarization via magnetocapacitive effects, holds promise for new generations of electronic devices. Here we present measurements on a simple cubic spinel compound with unusual, and potentially useful, magnetic and electric properties: it shows ferromagnetic order coexisting with relaxor ferroelectricity ( a ferroelectric cluster state with a smeared-out phase transition), both having sizable ordering temperatures and moments. Close to the ferromagnetic ordering temperature, the magnetocapacitive coupling ( characterized by a variation of the dielectric constant in an external magnetic field) reaches colossal values, approaching 500 per cent. We attribute the relaxor properties to geometric frustration, which is well known for magnetic moments but here is found to impede long-range order of the structural degrees of freedom that drive the formation of the ferroelectric state.","Univ Augsburg, Ctr Elect Correlat & Magnetism, D-86159 Augsburg, Germany; Moldavian Acad Sci, Inst Phys Appl, MD-2028 Kishinev, Moldova","Lunkenheimer, P (reprint author), Univ Augsburg, Ctr Elect Correlat & Magnetism, D-86159 Augsburg, Germany.",peter.lunkenheimer@physik.uni-augsburg.de,"Lunkenheimer, Peter/C-6196-2008; Loidl, Alois/L-8199-2015","Lunkenheimer, Peter/0000-0002-4525-1394; Loidl, Alois/0000-0002-5579-0746",,,,29,343,350,7,96,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,17-Mar,2005,434,7031,,,,,364,367,,10.1038/nature03348,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,907KG,WOS:000227715100046,15772656,No,,,11/20/17

Similarly, selective vibrational excitation of adsorbed molecules with an STM tip to induce motion or dissociation has been widely demonstrated(3,4). Such experiments are usually performed on weakly bound atoms that need to be stabilized by operating at cryogenic temperatures. Analogous experiments at room temperature(5) are more difficult, because they require relatively strongly bound species that are not perturbed by random thermal fluctuations. But manipulation can still be achieved through electronic excitation of the atom or molecule by the electron current(6-11) tunnelling between STM tip and surface at relatively high bias voltages(10,11), typically 1 - 5V. Here we use this approach to selectively dissociate chlorine atoms from individual oriented chlorobenzene molecules adsorbed on a Si( 111)- 7 x 7 surface. We map out the final destination of the chlorine daughter atoms, finding that their radial and angular distributions depend on the tunnelling current and hence excitation rate. In our system, one tunnelling electron has nominally sufficient energy to induce dissociation, yet the process requires two electrons. We explain these observations by a two-electron mechanism that couples vibrational excitation and dissociative electron attachment steps.","Univ Birmingham, Sch Phys & Astron, Nanoscale Phys Res Lab, Birmingham B15 2TT, W Midlands, England","Palmer, RE (reprint author), Univ Birmingham, Sch Phys & Astron, Nanoscale Phys Res Lab, Birmingham B15 2TT, W Midlands, England.",r.e.palmer@bham.ac.uk,"Sloan, Peter/E-4734-2011; Palmer, Richard/A-5366-2008","Sloan, Peter/0000-0002-0810-8468; Palmer, Richard/0000-0001-8728-8083",,,,30,123,123,1,64,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,17-Mar,2005,434,7031,,,,,367,371,,10.1038/nature03385,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,907KG,WOS:000227715100047,15772657,No,,,11/20/17

It is also thought that such regions have an increased density of about 0 - 20 per cent (ref. 1). A number of origins for ULVZs have been proposed, such as ponding of dense silicate melt(2), core - mantle reaction zones(3) or underside sedimentation from the core(4). Here we suggest that ULVZs might instead be relics of banded iron formations subducted to the core - mantle boundary between 2.8 and 1.8 billion years ago. Consisting mainly of interbedded iron oxides and silica, such banded iron formations were deposited in the world's oceans during the late Archaean and early Proterozoic eras. We argue that these layers, as part of the ocean floor, would be recycled into the Earth's interior by subduction(5), sink to the bottom of the mantle and may explain all of the observed features of ULVZs.","UCL, Dept Earth Sci, London WC1E 6BT, England","Dobson, DP (reprint author), UCL, Dept Earth Sci, Gower St, London WC1E 6BT, England.",d.dobson@ucl.ac.uk,"Brodholt, John/B-7136-2011","Brodholt, John/0000-0001-7395-5834",,,,28,74,78,2,23,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,17-Mar,2005,434,7031,,,,,371,374,,10.1038/nature03385,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,907KG,WOS:000227715100048,15772658,No,,,11/20/17

It has been claimed that these worms have collar tentacles and blend morphological features of the two main hemichordate body plans, namely the tentacle-less enteropneusts and the tentacle-bearing pterobranchs. Consequently, lophenteropneusts have been invoked as missing links to suggest that the former evolved into the latter(5). The most significant aspect of the lophenteropneust hypothesis is its prediction that the fundamental body plan within a basal phylum of deuterostomes was enteropneust-like. The assumption of such an ancestral state influences ideas about the evolution of the vertebrates from the invertebrates(9-14). Here we report on the first collected specimen of a broad-collared, deep-sea enteropneust and describe it as a new family, genus and species. The collar, although disproportionately broad, lacks tentacles. In addition, we find no evidence of tentacles in the available deep-sea photographs ( published and unpublished) of broad-collared enteropneusts, including those formerly designated as lophenteropneusts. Thus, the lophenteropneust hypothesis was based on misinterpretation of deep-sea photographs of low quality and should no longer be used to support the idea that the enteropneust body plan is basal within the phylum Hemichordata.","Univ Calif San Diego, Scripps Inst Oceanog, Div Marine Biol Res, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; Monterey Bay Aquarium Res Inst, Moss Landing, CA 95039 USA; Natl Inst Water & Atmospher Res, Wellington, New Zealand; Russian Acad Sci, PP Shirshov Oceanol Inst, Moscow 117851, Russia; Smithsonian Inst, Natl Museum Nat Hist, Washington, DC 20013 USA; Natl Museum Nat Hist, NOAA, Natl Systemat Lab, Washington, DC 20013 USA","Holland, ND (reprint author), Univ Calif San Diego, Scripps Inst Oceanog, Div Marine Biol Res, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.",nholland@ucsd.edu,,,,,,25,33,33,1,12,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,17-Mar,2005,434,7031,,,,,374,376,,10.1038/nature03382,,3,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,907KG,WOS:000227715100049,15772659,No,,,11/20/17

Cospeciation is especially rare in RNA viruses, in which cross-species transfer is the dominant mode of evolution(6-9). Simian foamy viruses (SFVs) are ubiquitous, non-pathogenic retroviruses that infect all primates(10,11). Here we test the co-speciation hypothesis in SFVs and their primate hosts by comparing the phylogenies of SFV polymerase and mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase subunit II from African and Asian monkeys and apes. The phylogenetic trees were remarkably congruent in both branching order and divergence times, strongly supporting cospeciation. Molecular clock calibrations revealed an extremely low rate of SFV evolution, 1.7 x 10(-8) substitutions per site per year, making it the slowest-evolving RNA virus documented so far. These results indicate that SFVs might have co-speciated with Old World primates for at least 30 million years, making them the oldest known vertebrate RNA viruses.","Ctr Dis Control & Prevent, HIV & Retrovirol Branch, Div HIV AIDS Prevent, Natl Ctr HIV STD & TB Prevent, Atlanta, GA 30333 USA; Univ Florida, Dept Pathol Immunol & Lab Med, Gainesville, FL 32610 USA; Duke Univ, Human Vaccine Inst, Durham, NC 27710 USA; Los Alamos Natl Lab, Los Alamos, NM 87545 USA; So Res Inst, Frederick, MD 21701 USA; Univ Rennes 1, CNRS, Biol Stn, F-35380 Paimpont, France; Cercopan, Calabar, Cross River Sta, Nigeria; Emory Univ, Winship Canc Ctr, Dept Pathol, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA; Univ Oxford, Dept Zool, Oxford OX1 3PS, England","Switzer, WM (reprint author), Ctr Dis Control & Prevent, HIV & Retrovirol Branch, Div HIV AIDS Prevent, Natl Ctr HIV STD & TB Prevent, 1600 Clifton Rd,MS G-19, Atlanta, GA 30333 USA.",bis3@cdc.gov,,"Holmes, Edward/0000-0001-9596-3552",,,,30,168,176,1,48,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,17-Mar,2005,434,7031,,,,,376,380,,10.1038/nature03341,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,907KG,WOS:000227715100050,15772660,No,,,11/20/17

In some cases however, kin-altruism effects appear to be modest(7-9). Do individuals favour kin to the extent that kin-altruism models predict? Data on remittances sent by South African migrant workers to their rural households of origin allow an explicit test, to our knowledge the first of its kind for humans. Using estimates of the fitness benefits and costs associated with the remittance, the genetic relatedness of the migrant to the beneficiaries of the transfer, and their age- and sex-specific reproductive values, we estimate the level of remittance that maximizes the migrant worker's inclusive fitness. This is a much better predictor of observed remittances than is average relatedness, even when we take account ( by means of a multiple regression) of covarying influences on the level of remittance. But the effect is modest: less than a third of the observed level of remittances can be explained by our kin-altruism model.","Univ KwaZulu Natal, ZA-4001 Durban, South Africa; Santa Fe Inst, Santa Fe, NM 87501 USA; Univ Siena, I-53100 Siena, Italy","Posel, D (reprint author), Univ KwaZulu Natal, King George V Ave, ZA-4001 Durban, South Africa.",posel@ukzn.ac.za,,"Posel, Dorrit/0000-0002-3343-875X",,,,21,19,21,1,9,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,17-Mar,2005,434,7031,,,,,380,383,,10.1038/nature03420,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,907KG,WOS:000227715100051,15772661,No,,,11/20/17

A quantitative genetics study using data from over 900 zebra finches in a complex breeding experiment showed that sperm head, mid-piece and flagellum length are heritable, that negative genetic correlations exist between sperm traits, and that significant indirect ( maternal) genetic effects exist. Selection on the zebra finch sperm phenotype may be low because sperm competition is infrequent in this species(6), and this, in combination with negative genetic correlations and maternal genetic effects, may account for the variation in sperm phenotype between males.

Good search performance is essential for survival, and hence mammals may have evolved efficient strategies for selecting fixation locations. Here we address two questions: what are the optimal eye movement strategies for a foveated visual system faced with the problem of finding a target in a cluttered environment, and do humans employ optimal eye movement strategies during a search? We derive the ideal bayesian observer(3-6) for search tasks in which a target is embedded at an unknown location within a random background that has the spectral characteristics of natural scenes(7). Our ideal searcher uses precise knowledge about the statistics of the scenes in which the target is embedded, and about its own visual system, to make eye movements that gain the most information about target location. We find that humans achieve nearly optimal search performance, even though humans integrate information poorly across fixations(8-10). Analysis of the ideal searcher reveals that there is little benefit from perfect integration across fixations - much more important is efficient processing of information on each fixation. Apparently, evolution has exploited this fact to achieve efficient eye movement strategies with minimal neural resources devoted to memory.","Univ Texas, Ctr Perceptual Syst, Austin, TX 78712 USA; Univ Texas, Dept Psychol, Austin, TX 78712 USA","Geisler, WS (reprint author), Univ Texas, Ctr Perceptual Syst, Austin, TX 78712 USA.",geisler@psy.utexas.edu,"Kato, Takaaki/A-6492-2010","Kato, Takaaki/0000-0002-7610-3853",,,,26,361,369,4,67,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,17-Mar,2005,434,7031,,,,,387,391,,10.1038/nature03390,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,907KG,WOS:000227715100053,15772663,No,,,11/20/17

It is possible that the first cleavage division contributes to this process, because in most mouse embryos the progeny of one two-cell blastomere primarily populate the embryonic part of the blastocyst and the progeny of its sister populate the abembryonic part(1-4). However, it is not known whether the embryonic - abembryonic axis is set up by the first cleavage itself, by polarity in the oocyte that then sets the first cleavage plane with respect to the animal pole, or indeed whether it can be divorced entirely from the first cleavage and established in relation to the animal pole. Here we test the importance of the orientation of the first cleavage by imposing an elongated shape on the zygote so that the division no longer passes close to the animal pole, marked by the second polar body. Non-invasive lineage tracing shows that even when the first cleavage occurs along the short axis imposed by this experimental treatment, the progeny of the resulting two-cell blastomeres tend to populate the respective embryonic and abembryonic parts of the blastocyst. Thus, the first cleavage contributes to breaking the symmetry of the embryo, generating blastomeres with different developmental characteristics.","Univ Cambridge, Wellcome Trust & Canc Res UK Gurdon Inst, Cambridge CB2 1QR, England; Univ Cambridge, Dept Genet, Cambridge CB2 3EH, England; Columbia Univ Coll Phys & Surg, Dept Genet & Dev, New York, NY 10032 USA","Zernicka-Goetz, M (reprint author), Univ Cambridge, Wellcome Trust & Canc Res UK Gurdon Inst, Tennis Court Rd, Cambridge CB2 1QR, England.",mzg@mole.bio.cam.ac.uk,,"Glover, David/0000-0003-0956-0103; Papaioannou, Virginia/0000-0001-7558-8601; Hadjantonakis, Anna-Katerina/0000-0002-7580-5124; Plusa, Berenika/0000-0003-2214-5940",Wellcome Trust [064421],,,14,97,105,2,14,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,17-Mar,2005,434,7031,,,,,391,395,,10.1038/nature03388,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,907KG,WOS:000227715100054,15772664,No,,,11/20/17

In 1865, migrans trombophlebitis ('a condition of the blood that predisposes it to spontaneous coagulation') was described as a forewarning of occult malignancy ( Trousseau's sign(1)). This pioneering observation emphasized the existence of haemostasis disorders associated with cancer onset; this phenomenon has since been extensively reported in clinical and epidemiological studies(2-4), but has so far resisted a mechanistic explanation. Here we report a mouse model of sporadic tumorigenesis based on genetic manipulation of somatic cells. Targeting the activated, human MET oncogene to adult liver caused slowly progressing hepatocarcinogenesis. This was preceded and accompanied by a syndrome manifesting first with blood hypercoagulation ( venous thromboses), and then evolving towards fatal internal haemorrhages. The pathogenesis of this syndrome is driven by the transcriptional response to the oncogene, including prominent upregulation of plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 (PAI-1) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) genes. In vivo analysis showed that both proteins support the thrombohaemorrhagic phenotype, thus providing direct genetic evidence for the long-sought-after link between oncogene activation and haemostasis.","Univ Turin, Sch Med, Inst Canc Res & Treatment, Div Mol Oncol, I-10060 Turin, Italy","Boccaccio, C (reprint author), Univ Turin, Sch Med, Inst Canc Res & Treatment, Div Mol Oncol, Str Prov 142, I-10060 Turin, Italy.",carla.boccaccio@ircc.it,"Naldini, Luigi/E-9083-2012; Girolami, Flavia/K-6304-2013","Girolami, Flavia/0000-0001-9005-5301; Boccaccio, Carla/0000-0003-2620-9083; Comoglio, Paolo/0000-0002-7056-5328; Follenzi, Antonia/0000-0001-9780-300X","Telethon [TGT03D03, TGT06S01]",,,30,166,176,1,7,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,17-Mar,2005,434,7031,,,,,396,400,,10.1038/nature03357,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,907KG,WOS:000227715100055,15772665,No,,,11/20/17

However, some genes escape X-inactivation and are expressed from both the active and inactive X chromosome. Such genes are potential contributors to sexually dimorphic traits, to phenotypic variability among females heterozygous for X-linked conditions, and to clinical abnormalities in patients with abnormal X chromosomes(3). Here, we present a comprehensive X-inactivation profile of the human X chromosome, representing an estimated 95% of assayable genes in fibroblast-based test systems(4,5). In total, about 15% of X-linked genes escape inactivation to some degree, and the proportion of genes escaping inactivation differs dramatically between different regions of the X chromosome, reflecting the evolutionary history of the sex chromosomes. An additional 10% of X-linked genes show variable patterns of inactivation and are expressed to different extents from some inactive X chromosomes. This suggests a remarkable and previously unsuspected degree of expression heterogeneity among females.","Penn State Univ, Coll Med, Dept Biochem & Mol Biol, Hershey, PA 17033 USA; Duke Univ, Inst Genome Sci & Policy, Durham, NC 27708 USA","Carrel, L (reprint author), Penn State Univ, Coll Med, Dept Biochem & Mol Biol, Hershey, PA 17033 USA.",lcarrel@psu.edu,,,,,,28,936,961,1,85,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,17-Mar,2005,434,7031,,,,,400,404,,10.1038/nature03479,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,907KG,WOS:000227715100056,15772666,No,,,11/20/17

Numerous stimuli trigger sustained or transient elevations of [Ca(2+)](cyt) that evoke downstream stimulus-specific responses. Generation of [Ca(2+)](cyt) signals is effected through stimulus-induced opening of Ca(2+)-permeable ion channels that catalyse a flux of Ca(2+) into the cytosol from extracellular or intracellular stores. Many classes of Ca(2+) current have been characterized electrophysiologically in plant membranes(2). However, the identity of the ion channels that underlie these currents has until now remained obscure. Here we show that the TPC1 ('two-pore channel 1') gene of Arabidopsis thaliana encodes a class of Ca(2+)-dependent Ca(2+)-release channel that is known from numerous electrophysiological studies as the slow vacuolar channel(3-5). Slow vacuolar channels are ubiquitous in plant vacuoles, where they form the dominant conductance at micromolar [Ca(2+)](cyt). We show that a tpc1 knockout mutant lacks functional slow vacuolar channel activity and is defective in both abscisic acid-induced repression of germination and in the response of stomata to extracellular calcium. These studies unequivocally demonstrate a critical role of intracellular Ca(2+)-release channels in the physiological processes of plants.","Univ York, Dept Biol, Area 9, York YO10 5YW, N Yorkshire, England; Univ Lancaster, Dept Biol, Lancaster Environm Ctr, Lancaster LA1 4YQ, England; Univ Oxford, Dept Plant Sci, Oxford OX1 3RB, England","Sanders, D (reprint author), Univ York, Dept Biol, Area 9, POB 373, York YO10 5YW, N Yorkshire, England.",ds10@york.ac.uk,"Peiter, Edgar/C-2577-2013","Peiter, Edgar/0000-0002-9104-3238; Knight, Heather/0000-0003-2047-6084; Hetherington, Alistair/0000-0001-6060-9203",Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council [P18580],,,30,270,289,3,69,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,17-Mar,2005,434,7031,,,,,404,408,,10.1038/nature03381,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,907KG,WOS:000227715100057,15772667,No,,,11/20/17

In contrast, genetic recoding by adenosine-to-inosine RNA editing seems common in animals; usually, altering highly conserved or invariant coding positions in proteins(2-4). Here I report striking variation between species in the recoding of synaptotagmin I (sytI). Fruitflies, mosquitoes and butterflies possess shared and species-specific sytI editing sites, all within a single exon. Honeybees, beetles and roaches do not edit sytI. The editing machinery is usually directed to modify particular adenosines by information stored in intron-mediated RNA structures(5-7). Combining comparative genomics of 34 species with mutational analysis reveals that complex, multi-domain, pre-mRNA structures solely determine species- appropriate RNA editing. One of these is a previously unreported long-range pseudoknot. I show that small changes to intronic sequences, far removed from an editing site, can transfer the species specificity of editing between RNA substrates. Taken together, these data support a phylogeny of sytI gene editing spanning more than 250 million years of hexapod evolution. The results also provide models for the genesis of RNA editing sites through the stepwise addition of structural domains, or by short walks through sequence space from ancestral structures.","Univ Connecticut, Ctr Hlth, Dept Genet & Dev Biol, Farmington, CT 06030 USA","Reenan, RA (reprint author), Univ Connecticut, Ctr Hlth, Dept Genet & Dev Biol, Farmington, CT 06030 USA.",rreenan@neuron.uchc.edu,,,,,,30,69,81,1,11,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,17-Mar,2005,434,7031,,,,,409,413,,10.1038/nature03364,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,907KG,WOS:000227715100058,15772668,No,,,11/20/17

The images reveal intricate surface albedo features that suggest aeolian, tectonic and fluvial processes; they also show a few circular features that could be impact structures. These observations imply that substantial surface modification has occurred over Titan's history. We have not directly detected liquids on the surface to date. Convective clouds are found to be common near the south pole, and the motion of mid-latitude clouds consistently indicates eastward winds, from which we infer that the troposphere is rotating faster than the surface.

It has changed our understanding of the requirements for quantum computation and more generally how we think about quantum physics. This new model requires qubits to be initialized in a highly entangled cluster state. From this point, the quantum computation proceeds by a sequence of single-qubit measurements with classical feedforward of their outcomes. Because of the essential role of measurement, a one-way quantum computer is irreversible. In the one-way quantum computer, the order and choices of measurements determine the algorithm computed. We have experimentally realized four-qubit cluster states encoded into the polarization state of four photons. We characterize the quantum state fully by implementing experimental four-qubit quantum state tomography. Using this cluster state, we demonstrate the feasibility of one-way quantum computing through a universal set of one-and two-qubit operations.

One characteristic feature of these materials is the strong trapping of electrons but not holes(1): organic field-effect transistors (FETs) typically show p-type, but not n-type, conduction even with the appropriate low-work- function electrodes, except for a few special high-electron-affinity(2-4) or low-bandgap(5) organic semiconductors. Here we demonstrate that the use of an appropriate hydroxyl-free gate dielectric - such as a divinyltetramethylsiloxanebis( benzocyclobutene) derivative ( BCB; ref. 6) - can yield n-channel FET conduction in most conjugated polymers. The FET electron mobilities thus obtained reveal that electrons are considerably more mobile in these materials than previously thought. Electron mobilities of the order of 10(-3) to 10(-2) cm(2) V-1 s(-1) have been measured in a number of polyfluorene copolymers and in a dialkyl-substituted poly(p-phenylenevinylene), all in the unaligned state. We further show that the reason why n-type behaviour has previously been so elusive is the trapping of electrons at the semiconductor - dielectric interface by hydroxyl groups, present in the form of silanols in the case of the commonly used SiO2 dielectric. These findings should therefore open up new opportunities for organic complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) circuits, in which both p-type and n-type behaviours are harnessed.","Univ Cambridge, Cavendish Lab, Cambridge CB3 0HE, England; Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Phys, Singapore S117542, Singapore; Inst Mat Res & Engn, Singapore S117602, Singapore","Ho, PKH (reprint author), Univ Cambridge, Cavendish Lab, Madingley Rd, Cambridge CB3 0HE, England.",phyhop@nus.edu.sg; rhf10@cam.ac.uk,,"Zaumseil, Jana /0000-0002-2048-217X; Sirringhaus, Henning/0000-0001-9827-6061",,,,25,1642,1653,49,703,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,10-Mar,2005,434,7030,,,,,194,199,,10.1038/nature03376,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,904JU,WOS:000227494500039,15758994,No,,,11/20/17

One of the most direct probes of the dynamics of this network is the infrared spectrum of the OH stretching vibration(3-11), which reflects the distribution of hydrogen-bonded structures and the intermolecular forces controlling the structural dynamics of the liquid. Indeed, water dynamics has been studied in detail(5-14), most recently using multi-dimensional nonlinear infrared spectroscopy(15,16) for acquiring structural and dynamical information on femtosecond timescales. But owing to technical difficulties, only OH stretching vibrations in D2O or OD vibrations in H2O could be monitored. Here we show that using a specially designed, ultrathin sample cell allows us to observe OH stretching vibrations in H2O. Under these fully resonant conditions, we observe hydrogen bond network dynamics more than one order of magnitude faster than seen in earlier studies that include an extremely fast sweep in the OH frequencies on a 50-fs timescale and an equally fast disappearance of the initial inhomogeneous distribution of sites. Our results highlight the efficiency of energy redistribution within the hydrogen-bonded network, and that liquid water essentially loses the memory of persistent correlations in its structure within 50 fs.","Univ Toronto, Dept Chem, Toronto, ON M5S 3H6, Canada; Univ Toronto, Dept Phys, Toronto, ON M5S 3H6, Canada; Max Born Inst Nichtlineare Opt & Kurzzeitspektros, D-12489 Berlin, Germany","Miller, RJD (reprint author), Univ Toronto, Dept Chem, 80 St George St, Toronto, ON M5S 3H6, Canada.",rjdmiller@lphys.chem.utoronto.ca,"Elsaesser, Thomas/P-7608-2014; Huse, Nils/A-5712-2017","Huse, Nils/0000-0002-3281-7600",,,,28,502,507,10,171,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,10-Mar,2005,434,7030,,,,,199,202,,10.1038/nature03383,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,904JU,WOS:000227494500040,15758995,No,,,11/20/17

However, there are some reports that the metastable crystalline phase of ice, cubic ice, may form in the Earth's atmosphere(3-5). Here we present laboratory experiments demonstrating that cubic ice forms when micrometre-sized droplets of pure water and aqueous solutions freeze homogeneously at cooling rates approaching those found in the atmosphere. We find that the formation of cubic ice is dominant when droplets freeze at temperatures below 190 K, which is in the temperature range relevant for polar stratospheric clouds and clouds in the tropical tropopause region. These results, together with heat transfer calculations, suggest that cubic ice will form in the Earth's atmosphere. If there were a significant fraction of cubic ice in some cold clouds this could increase their water vapour pressure, and modify their microphysics and ice particle size distributions(5). Under specific conditions this may lead to enhanced dehydration of the tropopause region(5).","Univ British Columbia, Dept Chem, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z1, Canada","Bertram, AK (reprint author), Univ British Columbia, Dept Chem, 2036 Main Mall, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z1, Canada.",bertram@chem.ubc.ca,"Murray, Benjamin/C-1219-2010; Knopf, Daniel/F-2040-2011","Murray, Benjamin/0000-0002-8198-8131; Knopf, Daniel/0000-0001-7732-3922",,,,30,138,140,7,74,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,10-Mar,2005,434,7030,,,,,202,205,,10.1038/nature03403,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,904JU,WOS:000227494500041,15758996,No,,,11/20/17

Nazca - South America convergence over the past 23 million years has created the 6-km-deep Peru - Chile trench, 150 km offshore. High pressure between the plates creates a locked zone, leading to deformation of the overriding plate. The surface area of this locked zone is thought to control the magnitude of co-seismic release and is limited by pressure, temperature, sediment type and fluid content(1). Here we present seafloor deformation data from the submerged South America plate obtained from a combination of Global Positioning System (GPS) receivers and acoustic transponders. We estimate that the measured horizontal surface motion perpendicular to the trench is consistent with a model having no slip along the thrust fault between 2 and 40 km depth. A tsunami in 1996, 200 km north of our site, was interpreted as being the result of an anomalously shallow interplate earthquake(2). Seismic coupling at shallow depths, such as we observe, may explain why co-seismic events in the Peruvian subduction zone create large tsunamis.","Univ Calif San Diego, Scripps Inst Oceanog, Marine Phys Lab, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; Univ Miami, Geodesy Dept, Miami, FL 33149 USA","Chadwell, CD (reprint author), Univ Calif San Diego, Scripps Inst Oceanog, Marine Phys Lab, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.",cchadwell@ucsd.edu,"Norabuena, Edmundo/I-5486-2013","Norabuena, Edmundo/0000-0002-1865-8922",,,,26,83,84,0,16,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,10-Mar,2005,434,7030,,,,,205,208,,10.1038/nature03412,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,904JU,WOS:000227494500042,15758997,No,,,11/20/17

The relative balance between supply and removal of nutrients - including nitrogen, iron and phosphorus - determines which nutrient limits phytoplankton growth. Although nitrogen limits productivity in much of the ocean(1,2), large portions of the tropics and subtropics are defined by extreme nitrogen depletion. In these regions, microbial denitrification removes biologically available forms of nitrogen from the water column, producing substantial deficits relative to other nutrients(3-5). Here we demonstrate that nitrogen-deficient areas of the tropical and subtropical oceans are acutely vulnerable to nitrogen pollution. Despite naturally high nutrient concentrations and productivity(6-8), nitrogen-rich agricultural runoff fuels large (54 - 577 km(2)) phytoplankton blooms in the Gulf of California. Runoff exerts a strong and consistent influence on biological processes, in 80% of cases stimulating blooms within days of fertilization and irrigation of agricultural fields. We project that by the year 2050, 27 - 59% of all nitrogen fertilizer will be applied in developing regions located upstream of nitrogen-deficient marine ecosystems. Our findings highlight the present and future vulnerability of these ecosystems to agricultural runoff.","Stanford Univ, Dept Geog & Environm Sci, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; Stanford Univ, Dept Geophys, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; Stanford Univ, Sch Earth Sci, Stanford, CA 94305 USA","Beman, JM (reprint author), Stanford Univ, Dept Geog & Environm Sci, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",beman@stanford.edu,,,,,,28,202,219,9,115,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,10-Mar,2005,434,7030,,,,,211,214,,10.1038/nature03370,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,904JU,WOS:000227494500044,,No,,,11/20/17

Although postsynaptic processing of each input is known to depend on its dendritic location(1-8), it is unclear whether activity-dependent synaptic modification is also location-dependent. Here we report that both the magnitude and the temporal specificity of spike-timing-dependent synaptic modification(9-17) vary along the apical dendrite of rat cortical layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons. At the distal dendrite, the magnitude of long-termpotentiation is smaller, and the window of pre-/postsynaptic spike interval for long-term depression (LTD) is broader. The spike-timing window for LTD correlates with the window of action potential-induced suppression of NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) receptors; this correlation applies to both their dendritic location-dependence and pharmacological properties. Presynaptic stimulation with partial blockade of NMDA receptors induced LTD and occluded further induction of spike-timing-dependent LTD, suggesting that NMDA receptor suppression underlies LTD induction. Computer simulation studies showed that the dendritic inhomogeneity of spike-timing-dependent synaptic modification leads to differential input selection at distal and proximal dendrites according to the temporal characteristics of presynaptic spike trains. Such location-dependent tuning of inputs, together with the dendritic heterogeneity of postsynaptic processing, could enhance the computational capacity of cortical pyramidal neurons.","Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mol & Cell Biol, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; Univ Calif Berkeley, Helen Wills Neurosci Inst, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA","Dan, Y (reprint author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mol & Cell Biol, 229 Stanley Hall, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",ydan@berkeley.edu,,"Dan, Yang/0000-0002-3818-877X; Froemke, Robert/0000-0002-1230-6811",,,,30,201,204,4,19,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,10-Mar,2005,434,7030,,,,,221,225,,10.1038/nature03366,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,904JU,WOS:000227494500047,15759002,No,,,11/20/17

T2Rs are a family of approximately 30 highly divergent G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs)(1,2) that are selectively expressed in the tongue and palate epithelium(1) and are implicated in bitter taste sensing(1-8). Here we demonstrate, using a combination of genetic, behavioural and physiological studies, that T2R receptors are necessary and sufficient for the detection and perception of bitter compounds, and show that differences in T2Rs between species ( human and mouse) can determine the selectivity of bitter taste responses. In addition, we show that mice engineered to express a bitter taste receptor in 'sweet cells'(9) become strongly attracted to its cognate bitter tastants, whereas expression of the same receptor ( or even a novel GPCR) in T2R-expressing cells resulted in mice that are averse to the respective compounds. Together these results illustrate the fundamental principle of bitter taste coding at the periphery: dedicated cells act as broadly tuned bitter sensors that are wired to mediate behavioural aversion.","Univ Calif San Diego, Howard Hughes Med Inst, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Biol, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Neurosci, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; Natl Inst Dent & Craniofacial Res, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA","Zuker, CS (reprint author), Univ Calif San Diego, Howard Hughes Med Inst, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.",charles@flyeye.ucsd.edu; nick.ryba@nih.gov,,,,,,21,277,291,9,77,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,10-Mar,2005,434,7030,,,,,225,229,,10.1038/nature03352,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,904JU,WOS:000227494500048,15759003,No,,,11/20/17

However, during embryonic dorsal - ventral patterning in Drosophila, two members of the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) family, Decapentaplegic (Dpp) and Screw (Scw), are broadly transcribed but promote receptor-mediated signalling in a restricted subset of expressing cells(2-4). Here we use a novel immunostaining protocol to visualize receptor-bound BMPs and show that both proteins become localized to a sharp stripe of dorsal cells. We demonstrate that proper BMP localization involves two distinct processes. First, Dpp undergoes directed, long-range extracellular transport. Scw also undergoes long-range movement, but can do so independently of Dpp transport. Second, an intracellular positive feedback circuit promotes future ligand binding as a function of previous signalling strength. These data elicit a model in which extracellular Dpp transport initially creates a shallow gradient of BMP binding that is acted on by positive intracellular feedback to produce two stable states of BMP - receptor interactions, a spatial bistability in which BMP binding and signalling capabilities are high in dorsal-most cells and low in lateral cells.","Univ Chicago, Dept Organismal Biol & Anat, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; Univ Chicago, Dept Mol Genet & Cell Biol, Chicago, IL 60637 USA","Ferguson, EL (reprint author), Univ Chicago, Dept Organismal Biol & Anat, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.",elfergus@midway.uchicago.edu,,"Ferguson, Edwin/0000-0003-4125-4253",,,,31,135,139,0,18,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,10-Mar,2005,434,7030,,,,,229,234,,10.1038/nature03318,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,904JU,WOS:000227494500049,15759004,No,,,11/20/17

This is despite clear evidence, at least with CD4(+) T cells, that monomeric ligands are not stimulatory(3,4). In an effort to understand how this remarkable sensitivity is achieved, we constructed soluble peptide - MHC heterodimers in which one peptide is an agonist and the other is one of the large number of endogenous peptide - MHCs displayed by presenting cells. We found that some specific combinations of these heterodimers can stimulate specific T cells in a CD4-dependent manner. This activation is severely impaired if the CD4-binding site on the agonist ligand is ablated, but the same mutation on an endogenous ligand has no effect. These data correlate well with analyses of lipid bilayers and cells presenting these ligands, and indicate that the basic unit of helper T cell activation is a heterodimer of agonist peptide - and endogenous peptide MHC complexes, stabilized by CD4.","Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Dept Microbiol & Immunol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Stanford, CA 94305 USA","Davis, MM (reprint author), Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Dept Microbiol & Immunol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",mdavis@cmgm.stanford.edu,,,,,,30,222,226,0,7,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,10-Mar,2005,434,7030,,,,,238,243,,10.1038/nature03391,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,904JU,WOS:000227494500051,15724150,No,,,11/20/17

All TLRs use the adaptor MyD88 for signalling(4), but the mechanisms underlying the MyD88-mediated gene induction programme are as yet not fully understood. Here, we demonstrate that the transcription factor IRF-5 is generally involved downstream of the TLR-MyD88 signalling pathway for gene induction of proinflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-12 and tumour-necrosis factor-alpha. In haematopoietic cells from mice deficient in the Irf5 gene (Irf5(-/-) mice), the induction of these cytokines by various TLR ligands is severely impaired, whereas interferon-alpha induction is normal. We also provide evidence that IRF-5 interacts with and is activated by MyD88 and TRAF6, and that TLR activation results in the nuclear translocation of IRF-5 to activate cytokine gene transcription. Consistently, Irf5(-/-) mice show resistance to lethal shock induced by either unmethylated DNA or lipopolysaccharide, which correlates with a marked decrease in the serum levels of proinflammatory cytokines. Thus, our study identifies IRF-5 as a new, principal downstream regulator of the TLR-MyD88 signalling pathway and a potential target of therapeutic intervention to control harmful immune responses.","Univ Toronto, Campbell Family Inst Breast Canc Res, Toronto, ON M5G 2M9, Canada; Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Med, Dept Immunol, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo 1130033, Japan; Univ Tokyo, Fac Med, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo 1130033, Japan; JST, PRESTO, Informat & Cell Funct, Kawaguchi, Saitama 3320012, Japan","Mak, TW (reprint author), Univ Toronto, Campbell Family Inst Breast Canc Res, 610 Univ Ave,Room 7-411, Toronto, ON M5G 2M9, Canada.",tmak@uhnres.utroronto.ca; tada@m.u-tokyo.ac.jp,"Ohba, Yusuke/E-7944-2011; Honda, Kenya/N-5297-2015; Tang, Amy/L-3226-2016; Kano, Shin-ichi/F-4144-2015","Tang, Amy/0000-0002-5772-2878; Kano, Shin-ichi/0000-0002-5171-3436",,,,30,544,577,2,28,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,10-Mar,2005,434,7030,,,,,243,249,,10.1038/nature03308,,7,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,904JU,WOS:000227494500052,15665823,No,,,11/20/17

Assuming that a quantum computer could be constructed, it would in practice be required to function with noisy devices called 'gates'. These gates cause decoherence of the fragile quantum states that are central to the computer's operation. The goal of so-called 'fault-tolerant quantum computing' is therefore to compute accurately even when the error probability per gate (EPG) is high. Here we report a simple architecture for fault-tolerant quantum computing, providing evidence that accurate quantum computing is possible for EPGs as high as three per cent. Such EPGs have been experimentally demonstrated, but to avoid excessive resource overheads required by the necessary architecture, lower EPGs are needed. Assuming the availability of quantum resources comparable to the digital resources available in today's computers, we show that non-trivial quantum computations at EPGs of as high as one per cent could be implemented.","Natl Inst Stand & Technol, Math & Computat Sci Div, Boulder, CO 80305 USA","Knill, E (reprint author), Natl Inst Stand & Technol, Math & Computat Sci Div, Boulder, CO 80305 USA.",knill@boulder.nist.gov,,,,,,34,424,427,1,26,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,3-Mar,2005,434,7029,,,,,39,44,,10.1038/nature03350,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,902ED,WOS:000227334600036,15744292,No,,,11/20/17

Although high-time-resolution observations are often possible in radio astronomy(2), they are usually limited to quite narrow fields of view. The dynamic radio sky is therefore poorly sampled, in contrast to the situation in the X-ray and gamma-ray bands in which wide-field instruments routinely detect transient sources(3). Here we report a transient radio source, GCRT J1745 - 3009, which was detected during a moderately wide-field monitoring programme of the Galactic Centre region(4,5) at 0.33 GHz. The characteristics of its bursts are unlike those known for any other class of radio transient. If located in or near the Galactic Centre, its brightness temperature (, 10 16 K) and the implied energy density within GCRT J1745 - 3009 vastly exceed those observed in most other classes of radio astronomical sources(6), and are consistent with coherent emission processes(7) that are rarely observed.

Recent controversial reports(11,12) claim the observation of neutrons from deuterium - deuterium fusion during acoustic cavitation(11,12.) However, there has been previously no strong experimental evidence for the existence of a plasma during single- or multi-bubble sonoluminescence. SBSL typically produces featureless emission spectra(13) that reveal little about the intra-cavity physical conditions or chemical processes. Here we report observations of atomic (Ar) emission and extensive molecular (SO) and ionic (O-2(+)) progressions in SBSL spectra from concentrated aqueous H2SO4 solutions. Both the Ar and SO emission permit spectroscopic temperature determinations, as accomplished for multi-bubble sonoluminescence with other emitters(14-16). The emissive excited states observed from both Ar and O-2(+) are inconsistent with any thermal process. The Ar excited states involved are extremely high in energy (> 13 eV) and cannot be thermally populated at the measured Ar emission temperatures (4,000 - 15,000 K); the ionization energy of O-2 is more than twice its bond dissociation energy, so O-2(+) likewise cannot be thermally produced. We therefore conclude that these emitting species must originate from collisions with high-energy electrons, ions or particles from a hot plasma core.","Univ Illinois, Dept Chem, Urbana, IL 61801 USA","Suslick, KS (reprint author), Univ Illinois, Dept Chem, 1209 W Calif St, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.",ksuslick@uiuc.edu,"Flannigan, David/E-4449-2014; Suslick, Kenneth/C-3281-2011","Flannigan, David/0000-0002-1829-1868; Suslick, Kenneth/0000-0001-5422-0701",,,,30,322,334,6,111,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,3-Mar,2005,434,7029,,,,,52,55,,10.1038/nature03361,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,902ED,WOS:000227334600039,15744295,No,,,11/20/17

Recent theoretical arguments(16 - 18) have suggested that synergistic interactions between self-organizing particles and a self-assembling matrix material can lead to hierarchically ordered structures. Here we show that mixtures of diblock copolymers and either cadmium selenide- or ferritin-based nanoparticles exhibit cooperative, coupled self-assembly on the nanoscale. In thin films, the copolymers assemble into cylindrical domains, which dictate the spatial distribution of the nanoparticles; segregation of the particles to the interfaces mediates interfacial interactions and orients the copolymer domains normal to the surface, even when one of the blocks is strongly attracted to the substrate.

Shallow-water sediments were replaced by mainly pelagic limestones in the Early Jurassic period, radiolarian cherts in the Middle - Late Jurassic period, and again pelagic limestones in the Late Jurassic - Cretaceous period(1). During initial extension, basin subsidence below the carbonate compensation depth (CCD) is thought to have triggered the transition from Early Jurassic limestones to Middle - Late Jurassic radiolarites(1). It has been proposed that the transition from radiolarites to limestones in the Late Jurassic period was due to an increase in calcareous nannoplankton abundance when the CCD was depressed below the ocean floor(1). But in modern oceans, sediments below the CCD are not necessarily radiolaritic. Here we present palaeomagnetic samples from the Jurassic - Cretaceous pelagic succession exposed in the Lombardian basin, Italy. On the basis of an analysis of our palaeolatitudinal data in a broader palaeogeographic context, we propose an alternative explanation for the above facies tripartition. We suggest that the Lombardian basin drifted initially towards, and subsequently away from, a near-equatorial upwelling zone of high biosiliceous productivity. Our tectonic model for the genesis of radiolarites adds an essential horizontal plate motion component to explanations involving only vertical variations of CCD relative to the ocean floor. It may explain the deposition of radiolarites throughout the Mediterranean and Middle Eastern region during the Jurassic period.","Univ Milan, Dept Earth Sci, I-20133 Milan, Italy; ALP Alpine Lab Paleomagnetism, I-12016 Peveragno, CN, Italy; Rutgers State Univ, Dept Geol Sci, Piscataway, NJ 08854 USA; Lamont Doherty Earth Observ, Palisades, NY 10964 USA; Univ Munich, Dept Geo & Umweltwissensch, D-80333 Munich, Germany","Muttoni, G (reprint author), Univ Milan, Dept Earth Sci, Via Mangiagalli 34, I-20133 Milan, Italy.",giovanni.muttoni1@unimi.it,"Bachtadse, Valerian/E-3457-2010","Bachtadse, Valerian/0000-0002-1226-2986; Muttoni, Giovanni/0000-0001-7908-1664; Kent, Dennis/0000-0002-7677-2993",,,,30,60,61,1,6,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,3-Mar,2005,434,7029,,,,,59,63,,10.1038/nature03378,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,902ED,WOS:000227334600041,15744297,No,,,11/20/17

Here we present a high-resolution oxygen isotope record of a U/Th-dated stalagmite from subtropical southern Brazil, covering the past 116,200 years. The oxygen isotope signature varies with shifts in the source region and amount of rainfall in the area, and hence records changes in atmospheric circulation and convective intensity over South America. We find that these variations in rainfall source and amount are primarily driven by summer solar radiation, which is controlled by the Earth's precessional cycle.

Here, however, we report unusually high water content in basaltic glasses from a cold region of the mid-ocean-ridge system in the equatorial Atlantic Ocean. These basalts are sodium-rich, having been generated by low degrees of melting of the mantle, and contain unusually high ratios of light versus heavy rare-earth elements, implying the presence of garnet in the melting region. We infer that water-rich basalts from such regions of thermal minima derive from low degrees of 'wet' melting greater than 60 km deep in the mantle, with minor dilution by melts produced by shallower 'dry' melting - a view supported by numerical modelling.

This leads to the question of why subordinate males help in the absence of observable reproductive benefits. Hamilton's concept of kin selection(3), whereby individuals can benefit indirectly by helping a relative, was a crucial breakthrough for understanding apparently altruistic systems. However in the only direct test of kin selection in coordinated display partnerships, partners were unrelated(1), discounting kin selection as an explanation for the evolution of cooperation. Here I show, using genetic measures of relatedness and reproductive success, that kin selection can explain the evolution of cooperative courtship in wild turkeys. Subordinate ( helper) males do not themselves reproduce, but their indirect fitness as calculated by Hamilton's rule(3,4) more than offsets the cost of helping. This result confirms a textbook example of kin selection(2) that until now has been controversial(5) and also extends recent findings(6-8) of male relatedness on avian leks by quantifying the kin-selected benefits gained by non-reproducing males.","Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Integrat Biol, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; Univ Calif Berkeley, Museum Vertebrate Zool, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA","Krakauer, AH (reprint author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Integrat Biol, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",krakauer@berkeley.edu,,,,,,27,96,98,6,171,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,3-Mar,2005,434,7029,,,,,69,72,,10.1038/nature03325,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,902ED,WOS:000227334600044,15744300,No,,,11/20/17

Here we test two key predictions: that patterns on the body's outline should be particularly effective in promoting concealment and that highly contrasting colours should enhance this disruptive effect. Artificial moth-like targets were exposed to bird predation in the field, with the experimental colour patterns on the 'wings' and a dead mealworm as the edible 'body'. Survival analysis supported the predictions, indicating that disruptive coloration is an effective means of camouflage, above and beyond background pattern matching.","Univ Bristol, Sch Biol Sci, Bristol BS8 1UG, Avon, England; Univ Bristol, Dept Expt Psychol, Bristol BS8 1TN, Avon, England","Cuthill, IC (reprint author), Univ Bristol, Sch Biol Sci, Woodland Rd, Bristol BS8 1UG, Avon, England.",i.cuthill@bristol.ac.uk,"Parraga, C.

Although all of these organelles generate hydrogen, the hydrogenosomes from these organisms are structurally and metabolically quite different, just like mitochondria where large differences also exist(3). These differences have led to a continuing debate about the evolutionary origin of hydrogenosomes(4,5). Here we show that the hydrogenosomes of the anaerobic ciliate Nyctotherus ovalis, which thrives in the hindgut of cockroaches, have retained a rudimentary genome encoding components of a mitochondrial electron transport chain. Phylogenetic analyses reveal that those proteins cluster with their homologues from aerobic ciliates. In addition, several nucleus-encoded components of the mitochondrial proteome, such as pyruvate dehydrogenase and complex II, were identified. The N. ovalis hydrogenosome is sensitive to inhibitors of mitochondrial complex I and produces succinate as a major metabolic end product - biochemical traits typical of anaerobic mitochondria(3). The production of hydrogen, together with the presence of a genome encoding respiratory chain components, and biochemical features characteristic of anaerobic mitochondria, identify the N. ovalis organelle as a missing link between mitochondria and hydrogenosomes.","Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Fac Sci, Dept Evolutionary Microbiol, NL-6525 ED Nijmegen, Netherlands; Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Med Ctr, Ctr Mol & Biomol Informat, NL-6500 HB Nijmegen, Netherlands; Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Med Ctr, NCMLS, Microscop Imaging Ctr, NL-6500 HB Nijmegen, Netherlands; Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Med Ctr, NCMLS, Dept Biochem, NL-6500 HB Nijmegen, Netherlands; Univ Utrecht, Fac Vet Med, Dept Biochem & Cell Biol, NL-3508 TD Utrecht, Netherlands; Univ Freiburg, Inst Organ Chem & Biochem, D-79104 Freiburg, Germany; Univ Groningen, Dept Eukaryot Microbiol, NL-9750 AA Haren, Netherlands","Hackstein, JHP (reprint author), Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Fac Sci, Dept Evolutionary Microbiol, Toernooiveld 1, NL-6525 ED Nijmegen, Netherlands.",j.hackstein@science.ru.nl,"Gabaldon, Toni/A-7336-2008; de Graaf, Rob/E-7665-2012; Koopman, Werner/N-3586-2014; Koopman, Werner/D-3592-2009; Huynen, Martijn/A-1530-2014","Gabaldon, Toni/0000-0003-0019-1735; Koopman, Werner/0000-0002-5340-6747; ",,,,30,131,140,5,41,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,3-Mar,2005,434,7029,,,,,74,79,,10.1038/nature03343,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,902ED,WOS:000227334600046,15744302,No,,,11/20/17

It is well known that the apparent lightness of a target depends on the context in which it is embedded(1-6), but there is extensive debate about the computations and representations underlying perceived lightness. One view asserts that the visual system explicitly separates surface reflectance from the prevailing illumination and atmospheric conditions in which it is embedded(7-10), generating layered image representations. Some recent theory has challenged this view and asserted that the human visual system derives surface lightness without explicitly segmenting images into multiple layers(11,12). Here we present new lightness illusions - the largest reported to date - that unequivocally demonstrate the effect that layered image representations can have in lightness perception. We show that the computations that underlie the decomposition of luminance into multiple layers under conditions of transparency can induce dramatic lightness illusions, causing identical texture patches to appear either black or white. These results indicate that mechanisms involved in decomposing images into layered representations can play a decisive role in the perception of surface lightness.","Univ New S Wales, Sch Psychol, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia; MIT, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA","Anderson, BL (reprint author), Univ New S Wales, Sch Psychol, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia.",bart.a@unsw.edu.au,,"Winawer, Jonathan/0000-0001-7475-5586",,,,18,94,96,2,17,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,3-Mar,2005,434,7029,,,,,79,83,,10.1038/nature03271,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,902ED,WOS:000227334600047,15744303,No,,,11/20/17

We tested whether peptides can be transferred directly from the cytoplasm of one cell into the cytoplasm of its neighbour through gap junctions. Here we show that peptides with a relative molecular mass of up to,1,800 diffuse intercellularly through gap junctions unless a three-dimensional structure is imposed. This intercellular peptide transfer causes cytotoxic T-cell recognition of adjacent, innocent bystander cells as well as activated monocytes. Gap-junction-mediated peptide transfer is restricted to a few coupling cells owing to the high cytosolic peptidase activity. We present a mechanism of antigen acquisition for cross-presentation that couples the antigen presentation system of two adjacent cells and is lost in most tumours: gap-junction-mediated intercellular peptide coupling for presentation by bystander MHC class I molecules and transfer to professional antigen presenting cells for cross-priming.","Netherlands Canc Inst, Div Tumor Biol, NL-1066 CX Amsterdam, Netherlands; Univ Med Ctr, Dept Immunohematol & Blood Transfus Leiden, NL-2333 RC Leiden, Netherlands","Neijssen, J (reprint author), Netherlands Canc Inst, Div Tumor Biol, Plesmanlaan 121, NL-1066 CX Amsterdam, Netherlands.",J.Neefjes@nki.nl,,"Neefjes, Jacques/0000-0001-6763-2211",,,,30,259,270,3,21,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,3-Mar,2005,434,7029,,,,,83,88,,10.1038/nature03290,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,902ED,WOS:000227334600048,15744304,No,,,11/20/17

Once primed in the presence of CD4(+) T cells, 'helped' CD8(+) T cells acquire the ability to undergo a second round of clonal expansion upon restimulation in the absence of T-cell help. 'Helpless' CD8(+) T cells that are primed in the absence of CD4(+) T cells, in contrast, can mediate effector functions such as cytotoxicity and cytokine secretion upon restimulation, but do not undergo a second round of clonal expansion. These disparate responses have features of being 'programmed', that is, guided by signals that are transmitted to naive CD8(+) T cells during priming, which encode specific fates for their clonal progeny. Here we explore the instructional programme that governs the secondary response of CD8(+) T cells and find that helpless cells undergo death by activation-induced cell death upon secondary stimulation. This death is mediated by tumour-necrosis factor (TNF)- related apoptosis-inducing ligand ( TRAIL). Regulation of Trail expression can therefore account for the role of CD4(+) T cells in the generation of CD8(+) T cell memory and represents a novel mechanism for controlling adaptive immune responses.","La Jolla Inst Allergy & Immunol, Div Cellular Immunol, San Diego, CA 92121 USA; Univ Minnesota, Sch Med, Ctr Immunol, Dept Microbiol, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA; Univ Iowa, Dept Urol, Interdisciplinary Grad Program Immunol, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA","Schoenberger, SP (reprint author), La Jolla Inst Allergy & Immunol, Div Cellular Immunol, 10355 Sci Ctr Dr, San Diego, CA 92121 USA.",doug@liai.org; sps@liai.org,,"Droin, Nathalie/0000-0002-6099-5324",,,,26,404,418,0,20,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,3-Mar,2005,434,7029,,,,,88,93,,10.1038/nature03337,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,902ED,WOS:000227334600049,15744305,No,,,11/20/17

In the first pathway, the proteins CED-2, CED-5 and CED-12 ( mammalian homologues CrkII, Dock180 and ELMO, respectively) function to activate CED-10 (Rac1)(7,8). In the second group, the candidate receptor CED-1 (CD91/LRP/SREC) probably recognizes an unknown ligand on the apoptotic cell(9) and signals via its cytoplasmic tail to the adaptor protein CED-6 (hCED-6/GULP)(10,11), whereas CED-7 (ABCA1) is thought to play a role in membrane dynamics(12). Molecular understanding of how the second pathway promotes engulfment of the apoptotic cell is lacking. Here, we show that CED-1, CED-6 and CED-7 are required for actin reorganization around the apoptotic cell corpse, and that CED-1 and CED-6 colocalize with each other and with actin around the dead cell. Furthermore, we find that the CED-10( Rac) GTPase acts genetically downstream of these proteins to mediate corpse removal, functionally linking the two engulfment pathways and identifying the CED-1, - 6 and - 7 signalling module as upstream regulators of Rac activation.","Univ Zurich, Inst Mol Biol, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland; SUNY Stony Brook, Dept Mol Genet & Microbiol, Stony Brook, NY 11743 USA; TU Braunschweig, Inst Genet, D-38106 Braunschweig, Germany","Hengartner, MO (reprint author), Univ Zurich, Inst Mol Biol, Winterthurerstr 190, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland.",Michael.Hengartner@molbio.unizh.ch,"Hengartner, Michael/A-7058-2008; Hengartner, Michael/E-6235-2011","Cabello, Juan/0000-0002-3835-0116; Hengartner, Michael/0000-0002-7584-596X",,,,30,173,197,0,7,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,3-Mar,2005,434,7029,,,,,93,99,,10.1038/nature03263,,7,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,902ED,WOS:000227334600050,15744306,No,,,11/20/17

This interaction requires a domain in PLC-gamma1 that includes a partial pleckstrin homology (PH)domain - a consensus lipid-binding and protein-binding sequence(5,6). We have developed a gestalt algorithm to detect hitherto 'invisible' PH and PH-like domains, and now report that the partial PH domain of PLC-gamma1 interacts with a complementary partial PH-like domain in TRPC3 to elicit lipid binding and cell-surface expression of TRPC3.

Different cyclins promote distinct cell-cycle events, but the molecular basis for these differences remains unclear(1,2). Here we compare the specificity of two budding yeast cyclins, the S-phase cyclin Clb5 and the M-phase cyclin Clb2, in the phosphorylation of 150 Cdk1 (Cdc28) substrates. About 24% of these proteins were phosphorylated more efficiently by Clb5 - Cdk1 than Clb2 - Cdk1. The Clb5-specific targets include several proteins (Sld2, Cdc6, Orc6, Mcm3 and Cdh1) involved in early S-phase events. Clb5 specificity depended on an interaction between a hydrophobic patch in Clb5 and a short sequence in the substrate ( the RXL or Cy motif). Phosphorylation of Clb5-specific targets during S phase was reduced by replacing Clb5 with Clb2 or by mutating the substrate RXL motif, confirming the importance of Clb5 specificity in vivo. Although we did not identify any highly Clb2-specific substrates, we found that Clb2 - Cdk1 possessed higher intrinsic kinase activity than Clb5 - Cdk1, enabling efficient phosphorylation of a broad range of mitotic Cdk1 targets. Thus, Clb5 and Clb2 use distinct mechanisms to enhance the phosphorylation of S-phase and M-phase substrates.","Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Physiol, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA","Morgan, DO (reprint author), Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Physiol, Box 0444, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA.",dmorgan@cgl.ucsf.edu,,,NIGMS NIH HHS [R01 GM069901],,,29,233,234,0,16,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,3-Mar,2005,434,7029,,,,,104,108,,10.1038/nature03329,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,902ED,WOS:000227334600052,15744308,No,,,11/20/17

In lower eukaryotes, Tdp1 removes topoisomerase 1 (top1) peptide from DNA termini during the repair of double-strand breaks created by collision of replication forks with top1 cleavage complexes in proliferating cells(2-4). Although TDP1 most probably fulfils a similar function in human cells, this role is unlikely to account for the clinical phenotype of SCAN1, which is associated with progressive degeneration of post-mitotic neurons. In addition, this role is redundant in lower eukaryotes, and Tdp1 mutations alone confer little phenotype(4-7). Moreover, defects in processing or preventing double-strand breaks during DNA replication are most probably associated with increased genetic instability and cancer, phenotypes not observed in SCAN1 ( ref. 8). Here we show that in human cells TDP1 is required for repair of chromosomal singlestrand breaks arising independently of DNA replication from abortive top1 activity or oxidative stress. We report that TDP1 is sequestered into multi-protein single-strand break repair (SSBR) complexes by direct interaction with DNA ligase IIIalpha and that these complexes are catalytically inactive in SCAN1 cells.

Caloric restriction causes many changes in glucose metabolism and extends lifespan; however, how this metabolism is connected to the ageing process is largely unknown. We show here that the Sir2 homologue, SIRT1 - which modulates ageing in several species(1-3) - controls the gluconeogenic/glycolytic pathways in liver in response to fasting signals through the transcriptional coactivator PGC-1alpha. A nutrient signalling response that is mediated by pyruvate induces SIRT1 protein in liver during fasting. We find that once SIRT1 is induced, it interacts with and deacetylates PGC-1alpha at specific lysine residues in an NAD(+)-dependent manner. SIRT1 induces gluconeogenic genes and hepatic glucose output through PGC-1alpha, but does not regulate the effects of PGC-1alpha on mitochondrial genes. In addition, SIRT1 modulates the effects of PGC-1alpha repression of glycolytic genes in response to fasting and pyruvate. Thus, we have identified a molecular mechanism whereby SIRT1 functions in glucose homeostasis as a modulator of PGC-1alpha.

However, the role of moisture supply in the initiation of large Northern Hemisphere ice sheets has remained unclear. The subarctic Pacific Ocean represents a significant source of water vapour to boreal North America, but it has been largely overlooked in efforts to explain Northern Hemisphere glaciation. Here we present alkenone unsaturation ratios and diatom oxygen isotope ratios from a sediment core in the western subarctic Pacific Ocean, indicating that 2.7 million years ago late-summer sea surface temperatures in this ocean region rose in response to an increase in stratification. At the same time, winter sea surface temperatures cooled, winter floating ice became more abundant and global climate descended into glacial conditions. We suggest that the observed summer warming extended into the autumn, providing water vapour to northern North America, where it precipitated and accumulated as snow, and thus allowed the initiation of Northern Hemisphere glaciation.","Geoforschungszentrum Potsdam, D-14473 Potsdam, Germany; Potsdam Inst Climate Impact Res, D-14473 Potsdam, Germany; Princeton Univ, Dept Geosci, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; Autonomous Univ Barcelona, ICREA, Bellaterra 08193, Catalonia, Spain; Autonomous Univ Barcelona, ICTA, Bellaterra 08193, Catalonia, Spain; UCL, Dept Geog, Environm Change Res Ctr, London WC1H 0AP, England; IFM Geomar, D-24148 Kiel, Germany; ETH, Dept Earth Sci, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland; British Geol Survey, NERC, Isotope Geosci Lab, Keyworth NG12 5GG, Notts, England; Univ Bristol, Biogeochem Ctr, Bristol BS8 1TS, Avon, England","Haug, GH (reprint author), Geoforschungszentrum Potsdam, D-14473 Potsdam, Germany.",haug@gfz-potsdam.de,"Swann, George/B-2794-2011; Sigman, Daniel/A-2649-2008; Ganopolski, Andrey/F-6811-2013; Rosell-Mele, Antoni/B-3433-2013; Jaccard, Samuel/G-3447-2014","Sigman, Daniel/0000-0002-7923-1973; Rosell-Mele, Antoni/0000-0002-5513-2647; Jaccard, Samuel/0000-0002-5793-0896; Leng, Melanie/0000-0003-1115-5166; Tiedemann, Ralf/0000-0001-7211-8049; Swann, George/0000-0002-4750-9504",ICREA,,,34,198,216,4,74,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,24-Feb,2005,433,7028,,,,,821,825,,10.1038/nature03332,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,899VT,WOS:000227174600032,15729332,No,,,11/20/17

Although intensively studied owing to its importance in determining the composition of the mature T-cell compartment and as a general model of binary lineage decisions, the underlying molecular pathways remain obscure. We have previously reported a spontaneous mouse mutant (HD ( helper deficient) mice) in which lineage commitment is specifically perturbed without affecting positive selection. Here we show that a point mutation in the zinc finger transcription factor Th-POK (T-helper-inducing POZ/Kruppel-like factor) is responsible for redirection of class-II-restricted thymocytes to the CD8 lineage in HD mice. Furthermore, we demonstrate that constitutive expression of this factor during thymic development leads to redirection of class-I-restricted thymocytes to the CD4 lineage, indicating that Th-POK is a master regulator of lineage commitment.","Fox Chase Canc Ctr, Philadelphia, PA 19111 USA; Univ Oklahoma, Dept Chem & Biochem, Norman, OK 73019 USA","Kappes, DJ (reprint author), Fox Chase Canc Ctr, 7701 Burholme Ave, Philadelphia, PA 19111 USA.",dj_kappes@fccc.edu,,,,,,32,240,247,1,12,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,24-Feb,2005,433,7028,,,,,826,833,,10.1038/nature03338,,8,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,899VT,WOS:000227174600033,15729333,No,,,11/20/17

The different effects of the solar wind on planet-forming materials for Earth and Venus have been proposed to account for some of this difference in atmospheric composition(2,3), but the cause of the compositional difference has not yet been fully resolved. Here we propose that the absence or presence of an ocean at the surface of a protoplanet during the giant impact phase could have determined its subsequent atmospheric amount and composition. Using numerical simulations, we demonstrate that the presence of an ocean significantly enhances the loss of atmosphere during a giant impact owing to two effects: evaporation of the ocean, and lower shock impedance of the ocean compared to the ground. Protoplanets near Earth's orbit are expected to have had oceans, whereas those near Venus' orbit are not, and we therefore suggest that remnants of the noble-gas rich proto-atmosphere survived on Venus, but not on Earth. Our proposed mechanism explains differences in the atmospheric contents of argon, krypton and xenon on Venus and Earth, but most of the neon must have escaped from both planets' atmospheres later to yield the observed ratio of neon to argon.","Univ Tokyo, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo 1130033, Japan","Genda, H (reprint author), Tokyo Inst Technol, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, Meguro Ku, 2-12-1 Ookayama, Tokyo 1528551, Japan.",genda@geo.titech.ac.jp,"Abe, Yutaka/I-1933-2012; Genda, Hidenori/A-7858-2014",,,,,30,94,94,0,10,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,24-Feb,2005,433,7028,,,,,842,844,,10.1038/nature03360,,3,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,899VT,WOS:000227174600035,15729335,No,,,11/20/17

This effect is the basis for a broad class of tunable sources known as Raman lasers(2,3). In general, these sources have only small gain (similar to10(-9) cm W(-1)) and therefore require external pumping with powerful lasers, which limits their applications. Here we report the realization of a semiconductor injection Raman laser designed to circumvent these limitations. The physics underlying our device differs in a fundamental way from existing Raman lasers(3-8): it is based on triply resonant stimulated Raman scattering between quantum-confined states within the active region of a quantum cascade laser that serves as an internal optical pump-the device is driven electrically and no external laser pump is required. This leads to an enhancement of orders of magnitude in the Raman gain, high conversion efficiency and low threshold. Our lasers combine the advantages of nonlinear optical devices and of semiconductor injection lasers, and could lead to a new class of compact and wavelength-agile mid- and far-infrared light sources.","Harvard Univ, Div Engn & Appl Sci, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; Texas A&M Univ, Dept Phys, College Stn, TX 77843 USA; Bell Labs, Lucent Technol, Murray Hill, NJ 07974 USA","Troccoli, M (reprint author), Harvard Univ, Div Engn & Appl Sci, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",troccoli@deas.harvard.edu; belyanin@jewel.tamu.edu,"Cubukcu, Ertugrul/F-4807-2010; Cubukcu, Ertugrul/D-5007-2012",,,,,20,103,104,4,27,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,24-Feb,2005,433,7028,,,,,845,848,,10.1038/nature03330,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,899VT,WOS:000227174600036,15729336,No,,,11/20/17

Beginning with the valence bond description(2) for the hydrogen molecule, quantum chemists have further explored the fundamental nature of the chemical bond for atoms throughout the periodic table, confirming that most molecules are indeed held together by one electron pair for each bond. But more complex binding may occur when large numbers of atomic orbitals can participate in bond formation. Such behaviour is common with transition metals. When involving heavy actinide elements, metal-metal bonds might prove particularly complicated. To date, evidence for actinide-actinide bonds is restricted to the matrix-isolation(3) of uranium hydrides, including H2U-UH2, and the gas-phase detection(4) and preliminary theoretical study(5) of the uranium molecule, U-2. Here we report quantum chemical calculations on U-2, showing that, although the strength of the U-2 bond is comparable to that of other multiple bonds between transition metals, the bonding pattern is unique. We find that the molecule contains three electron-pair bonds and four one-electron bonds (that is, 10 bonding electrons, corresponding to a quintuple bond), and two ferromagnetically coupled electrons localized on one U atom each-so all known covalent bonding types are contributing.","Univ Palermo, Dipartimento Chim Fis F Accascina, I-90128 Palermo, Italy; Chem Ctr Lund, Dept Theoret Chem, S-22100 Lund, Sweden","Gagliardi, L (reprint author), Univ Palermo, Dipartimento Chim Fis F Accascina, Viale Sci,Parco Orleans 2, I-90128 Palermo, Italy.",laura.gagliardi@unipa.it,,"Gagliardi, Laura/0000-0001-5227-1396",,,,14,189,190,2,65,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,24-Feb,2005,433,7028,,,,,848,851,,10.1038/nature03249,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,899VT,WOS:000227174600037,15729337,No,,,11/20/17

Synthesizing these results with geochemical(7-9) and other geophysical(10-13) evidence reveals highly symmetric lower-crustal and upper-mantle lithosphere extensional deformation, suggesting a pure-shear rifting mechanism for the Rio Grande rift. Extension in the lower crust is distributed over a region four times the width of the rift's surface expression. Here we propose that the laterally distributed, pure shear extension is a combined effect of low strain rate and a regionally elevated geotherm, possibly abetted by pre-existing lithospheric structures, at the time of rift initiation. Distributed extension in the lower crust and mantle has induced less concentrated vertical mantle upwelling and less vigorous small-scale convection(14) than would have arisen from more localized deformation. This lack of highly focused mantle upwelling may explain a deficit of rift-related volcanics in the Rio Grande rift compared to other major rift systems such as the Kenya rift(15,16).","New Mexico Inst Min & Technol, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, Socorro, NM 87801 USA; New Mexico Inst Min & Technol, Geophys Res Ctr, Socorro, NM 87801 USA; Arizona State Univ, Dept Geol Sci, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA; Los Alamos Natl Lab, Div Earth & Environm Sci, Los Alamos, NM 87545 USA; Univ Texas, Jackson Sch Geosci, Austin, TX 78712 USA; New Mexico State Univ, Dept Phys, Las Cruces, NM 88003 USA","Wilson, D (reprint author), New Mexico Inst Min & Technol, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, Socorro, NM 87801 USA.",davew@ees.nmt.edu,"Grand, Stephen/B-4238-2011; Aster, Richard/E-5067-2013","Aster, Richard/0000-0002-0821-4906",,,,30,54,56,0,19,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,24-Feb,2005,433,7028,,,,,851,855,,10.1038/nature03297,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,899VT,WOS:000227174600038,15729338,No,,,11/20/17

Here we present evidence that the 'incipient rift' has also rifted towards the east and opens anticlockwise about a pivot at its eastern end. The 'incipient rift' then bounds a second microplate, north of the clockwise-rotating Galapagos microplate. The Galapagos triple junction region, in the eastern equatorial Pacific Ocean, thus consists of two counter-rotating microplates partly separated by the Hess Deep rift.

Here we report a new, Late Cretaceous member of the clade, Neuquenraptor argentinus gen. et sp. nov., representing uncontroversial evidence of a deinonychosaurian theropod in the Southern Hemisphere. The new discovery demonstrates that Cretaceous theropod faunas from the southern continents shared greater similarity with those of the northern landmasses than previously thought. Available evidence suggests that deinonychosaurians were probably distributed worldwide at least by the beginning of the Cretaceous period. The phylogenetic position of the new deinonychosaur, as well as other Patagonian coelurosaurian theropods, is compatible with a vicariance model of diversification for some groups of Gondwanan and Laurasian dinosaurs.","Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn, Museo Argentino Ciencias Nat Bernardino Rivadavia, RA-1405 Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; Ohio State Univ, Math Biosci Inst, Columbus, OH 43210 USA","Novas, FE (reprint author), Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn, Museo Argentino Ciencias Nat Bernardino Rivadavia, Av Angel Gallardo 470, RA-1405 Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina.",fernovas@yahoo.com.ar,"Pol, Diego/A-8007-2008","Pol, Diego/0000-0002-9690-7517",,,,30,51,56,1,9,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,24-Feb,2005,433,7028,,,,,858,861,,10.1038/nature03285,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,899VT,WOS:000227174600040,15729340,No,,,11/20/17

This sub-seafloor activity of microorganisms may influence the surface Earth by changing the chemistry of the ocean and by triggering the emission of methane, with consequences for the marine carbon cycle and even the global climate(4-6). Despite the fact that only about 1% of the total marine primary production of organic carbon is available for deep-sea microorganisms(7,8), subseafloor sediments harbour over half of all prokaryotic cells on Earth(7). This estimation has been calculated from numerous microscopic cell counts in sediment cores of the Ocean Drilling Program(1,9). Because these counts cannot differentiate between dead and alive cells, the population size of living microorganisms is unknown(10,11). Here, using ribosomal RNA as a target for the technique known as catalysed reporter deposition-fluorescence in situ hybridization (CARD-FISH), we provide direct quantification of live cells as defined by the presence of ribosomes. We show that a large fraction of the sub-seafloor prokaryotes is alive, even in very old (16 million yr) and deep (>400 m) sediments. All detectable living cells belong to the Bacteria and have turnover times of 0.25-22 yr, comparable to surface sediments.","Fed Inst Geosci & Nat Resources, Sect Geomicrobiol, D-30655 Hannover, Germany; Max Planck Inst Marine Microbiol, Dept Biogeochem, D-28359 Bremen, Germany; Geoforschungszentrum Potsdam, D-14473 Potsdam, Germany; Univ Wales Coll Cardiff, Sch Earth Ocean & Planetary Sci, Cardiff CF10 3YE, S Glam, Wales","Schippers, A (reprint author), Fed Inst Geosci & Nat Resources, Sect Geomicrobiol, Stilleweg 2, D-30655 Hannover, Germany.",a.schippers@bgr.de,"Cragg, Barry/D-2690-2009; Parkes, Ronald/B-1731-2010; Kallmeyer, Jens/I-3554-2012; Ferdelman, Timothy/A-3758-2013; Jorgensen, Bo/C-2214-2013","Parkes, Ronald/0000-0001-9402-5943; Kallmeyer, Jens/0000-0002-6440-1140; Jorgensen, Bo/0000-0001-9398-8027",,,,30,270,293,5,76,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,24-Feb,2005,433,7028,,,,,861,864,,10.1038/nature03302,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,899VT,WOS:000227174600041,15729341,No,,,11/20/17

These adaptations include reduction or elimination of most mitochondrial metabolic pathways and the use of oxidative stress enzymes generally associated with anaerobic prokaryotes. Phylogenomic analysis identifies evidence for lateral gene transfer of bacterial genes into the E. histolytica genome, the effects of which centre on expanding aspects of E. histolytica's metabolic repertoire. The presence of these genes and the potential for novel metabolic pathways in E. histolytica may allow for the development of new chemotherapeutic agents. The genome encodes a large number of novel receptor kinases and contains expansions of a variety of gene families, including those associated with virulence. Additional genome features include an abundance of tandemly repeated transfer-RNA-containing arrays, which may have a structural function in the genome.

Here we investigate whether there is an additional, finer level of specificity that creates subnetworks of excitatory neurons within functional columns. We tested for fine-scale specificity of connections to cortical layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons in rat visual cortex by using cross-correlation analyses of synaptic currents evoked by photostimulation. Recording simultaneously from adjacent layer 2/3 pyramidal cells, we find that when they are connected to each other (20% of all recorded pairs) they share common input from layer 4 and within layer 2/3. When adjacent layer 2/3 neurons are not connected to each other, they share very little ( if any) common excitatory input from layers 4 and 2/3. In contrast, all layer 2/3 neurons share common excitatory input from layer 5 and inhibitory input from layers 2/3 and 4, regardless of whether they are connected to each other. Thus, excitatory connections from layer 4 to layer 2/3 and within layer 2/3 form fine-scale assemblies of selectively interconnected neurons; inhibitory connections and excitatory connections from layer 5 link neurons across these fine-scale subnetworks. Relatively independent subnetworks of excitatory neurons are therefore embedded within the larger-scale functional architecture; this allows neighbouring neurons to convey information more independently than suggested by previous descriptions of cortical circuitry.","Salk Inst Biol Studies, Syst Neurobiol Labs, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA","Callaway, EM (reprint author), Salk Inst Biol Studies, Syst Neurobiol Labs, 10010 N Torrey Pines Rd, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA.",callaway@salk.edu,"Callaway, Edward/D-4336-2011","Callaway, Edward/0000-0002-6366-5267",NIMH NIH HHS [R01 MH063912],,,30,333,339,1,25,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,24-Feb,2005,433,7028,,,,,868,873,,10.1038/nature03291,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,899VT,WOS:000227174600043,15729343,No,,,11/20/17

Studies in monkeys using a laboratory test of this capacity-conditional association learning-have revealed that frontal lobe structures ( including the prefrontal cortex) as well as subcortical nuclei of the basal ganglia are involved in such learning(1-5). Neural correlates of associative learning have been observed in both brain regions(6-14), but whether or not these regions have unique functions is unclear, as they have typically been studied separately using different tasks. Here we show that during associative learning in monkeys, neural activity in these areas changes at different rates: the striatum ( an input structure of the basal ganglia) showed rapid, almost bistable, changes compared with a slower trend in the prefrontal cortex that was more in accordance with slow improvements in behavioural performance. Also, pre-saccadic activity began progressively earlier in the striatum but not in the prefrontal cortex as learning took place. These results support the hypothesis that rewarded associations are first identified by the basal ganglia, the output of which 'trains' slower learning mechanisms in the frontal cortex(15).","MIT, Picower Ctr Learning & Memory, RIKEN MIT Neurosci Res Ctr, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; MIT, Dept Brain & Cognit Sci, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA","Pasupathy, A (reprint author), MIT, Picower Ctr Learning & Memory, RIKEN MIT Neurosci Res Ctr, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",anitha@mit.edu,,,,,,30,432,439,1,35,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,24-Feb,2005,433,7028,,,,,873,876,,10.1038/nature03287,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,899VT,WOS:000227174600044,15729344,No,,,11/20/17

Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator ( CFTR), the protein dysfunctional in cystic fibrosis, is unique among ABC proteins in that its transmembrane domains comprise an ion channel. Opening and closing of the pore have been linked to ATP binding and hydrolysis at CFTR's two nucleotide-binding domains, NBD1 and NBD2 (see, for example, refs 1, 2). Isolated NBDs of prokaryotic ABC proteins dimerize upon binding ATP, and hydrolysis of the ATP causes dimer dissociation(3-5). Here, using single-channel recording methods on intact CFTR molecules, we directly follow opening and closing of the channel gates, and relate these occurrences to ATP-mediated events in the NBDs. We find that energetic coupling(6) between two CFTR residues, expected to lie on opposite sides of its predicted NBD1-NBD2 dimer interface, changes in concert with channel gating status. The two monitored side chains are independent of each other in closed channels but become coupled as the channels open. The results directly link ATP-driven tight dimerization of CFTR's cytoplasmic nucleotide-binding domains to opening of the ion channel in the transmembrane domains. This establishes a molecular mechanism, involving dynamic restructuring of the NBD dimer interface, that is probably common to all members of the ABC protein superfamily.","Rockefeller Univ, Lab Cardiac Membrane Physiol, New York, NY 10021 USA; Rockefeller Univ, Lab Mol Neurobiol & Biophys, New York, NY 10021 USA; Rockefeller Univ, Mol & Cellular Neurosci Lab, New York, NY 10021 USA; Yale Univ, Dept Psychiat, New Haven, CT 06519 USA","Gadsby, DC (reprint author), Rockefeller Univ, Lab Cardiac Membrane Physiol, 1230 York Ave, New York, NY 10021 USA.",paola.vergani@rockefeller.edu; gadsby@rockefeller.edu,"Vergani, Paola/C-2019-2008","Vergani, Paola/0000-0002-5422-4662; Nairn, Angus/0000-0002-7075-0195","NIDDK NIH HHS [R01 DK051767, R01 DK051767-09]",,,28,265,271,1,17,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,24-Feb,2005,433,7028,,,,,876,880,,10.1038/nature03313,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,899VT,WOS:000227174600045,15729345,No,,,11/20/17

The prevailing hypothesis is that this amplification stems from somatic electromotility of the outer hair cells attributable to the motor protein prestin(2,3). Thus outer hair cells contract and elongate in synchrony with the sound-evoked receptor potential(4,5). But problems arise with this mechanism at high frequencies, where the periodic component of the receptor potential will be attenuated by the membrane time constant. On the basis of work in non-mammalian vertebrates, force generation by the hair bundles has been proposed as an alternative means of boosting the mechanical stimulus(6,7). Here we show that hair bundles of mammalian outer hair cells can also produce force on a submillisecond timescale linked to adaptation of the mechano-transducer channels. Because the bundle motor may ultimately be limited by the deactivation rate of the channels, it could theoretically operate at high frequencies. Our results show the existence of another force generator in outer hair cells that may participate in cochlear amplification.","Univ Wisconsin, Sch Med, Dept Physiol, Madison, WI 53706 USA; Univ Bristol, Dept Physiol, Bristol BS8 1TD, Avon, England; Univ Cambridge, Dept Physiol, Cambridge CB2 3EG, England","Fettiplace, R (reprint author), Univ Wisconsin, Sch Med, Dept Physiol, Madison, WI 53706 USA.",fettiplace@physiology.wisc.edu,,,,,,30,195,206,0,23,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,24-Feb,2005,433,7028,,,,,880,883,,10.1038/nature03367,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,899VT,WOS:000227174600046,15696193,No,,,11/20/17

Little is known about the genetic programmes that maintain the undifferentiated phenotype of lineage-restricted stem cells. Here we describe the molecular details of a nodal point in adult melanocyte stem cell differentiation in which Pax3 simultaneously functions to initiate a melanogenic cascade while acting downstream to prevent terminal differentiation. Pax3 activates expression of Mitf, a transcription factor critical for melanogenesis(2,3), while at the same time it competes with Mitf for occupancy of an enhancer required for expression of dopachrome tautomerase, an enzyme that functions in melanin synthesis(4). Pax3-expressing melanoblasts are thus committed but undifferentiated until Pax3-mediated repression is relieved by activated beta-catenin. Thus, a stem cell transcription factor can both determine cell fate and simultaneously maintain an undifferentiated state, leaving a cell poised to differentiate in response to external stimuli.","Univ Penn, Dept Med, Div Cardiovasc, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; Univ Penn, Dept Dermatol, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; Yeshiva Univ Albert Einstein Coll Med, Dept Cell Biol, Bronx, NY 10461 USA","Epstein, JA (reprint author), Univ Penn, Dept Med, Div Cardiovasc, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",epsteinj@mail.med.upenn.edu,,,,,,30,223,237,0,17,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,24-Feb,2005,433,7028,,,,,884,887,,10.1038/nature03292,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,899VT,WOS:000227174600047,15729346,No,,,11/20/17

Dendritic cells are the principal cross-presenting APCs in vivo and much progress has been made in elucidating the pathways that allow dendritic cells to capture and process cellular material(1). However, little is known about the signals that determine whether such presentation ultimately results in a cytotoxic T cell (CTL) response (cross-priming) or in CD8(+) T cell inactivation (cross-tolerance). Here we describe a mechanism that promotes cross-priming during viral infections. We show that murine CD8alpha(+) dendritic cells are activated by double-stranded (ds)RNA present in virally infected cells but absent from uninfected cells. Dendritic cell activation requires phagocytosis of infected material, followed by signalling through the dsRNA receptor, toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3). Immunization with virus-infected cells or cells containing synthetic dsRNA leads to a striking increase in CTL cross-priming against cell-associated antigens, which is largely dependent on TLR3 expression by antigen-presenting cells. Thus, TLR3 may have evolved to permit cross-priming of CTLs against viruses that do not directly infect dendritic cells.","Canc Res UK London Res Inst, Lincolns Inn Fields Labs, Immunobiol Lab, London WC2A 3PX, England; Karolinska Inst, Ctr Microbiol & Tumor Biol, SE-17177 Stockholm, Sweden; Swedish Inst Infect Dis Control, Dept Vaccine Res, S-17177 Stockholm, Sweden; Yale Univ, Sch Med, Immunobiol Sect, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; Howard Hughes Med Inst, New Haven, CT 06520 USA","Sousa, CRE (reprint author), Canc Res UK London Res Inst, Lincolns Inn Fields Labs, Immunobiol Lab, 44 Lincolns Inn Fields, London WC2A 3PX, England.",caetano@cancer.org.uk,"Azuma, Yasu-Taka/C-7561-2009; chen, margaret/B-6757-2014; Alexopoulou, Lena/A-5041-2017","Alexopoulou, Lena/0000-0003-4619-697X; Liljestrom, Peter/0000-0002-2132-0981; Reis e Sousa, Caetano/0000-0001-7392-2119; Nolte, Martijn/0000-0002-5447-0839",,,,30,543,572,0,28,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,24-Feb,2005,433,7028,,,,,887,892,,10.1038/nature03326,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,899VT,WOS:000227174600048,15711573,No,,,11/20/17

Balancing of the light absorption capacity of these two photosystems is achieved through the reversible association of the major antenna complex (LHCII) between PSII and PSI (ref. 3). Excess stimulation of PSII relative to PSI leads to the reduction of the plastoquinone pool and the activation of a kinase(4,5); the phosphorylation of LHCII; and the displacement of LHCII from PSII to PSI ( state 2). Oxidation of the plastoquinone pool by excess stimulation of PSI reverses this process ( state 1). The Chlamydomonas thylakoid-associated Ser-Thr kinase Stt7, which is required for state transitions, has an orthologue named STN7 in Arabidopsis(6). Here we show that loss of STN7 blocks state transitions and LHCII phosphorylation.

Interpretation of these data remains, however, a major scientific challenge. Here, we propose a methodology that enables us to extract and display information contained in complex networks(1-3). Specifically, we demonstrate that we can find functional modules(4,5) in complex networks, and classify nodes into universal roles according to their pattern of intra- and inter-module connections. The method thus yields a 'cartographic representation' of complex networks. Metabolic networks(6-8) are among the most challenging biological networks and, arguably, the ones with most potential for immediate applicability(9). We use our method to analyse the metabolic networks of twelve organisms from three different superkingdoms. We find that, typically, 80% of the nodes are only connected to other nodes within their respective modules, and that nodes with different roles are affected by different evolutionary constraints and pressures. Remarkably, we find that metabolites that participate in only a few reactions but that connect different modules are more conserved than hubs whose links are mostly within a single module.","Northwestern Univ, NICO, Evanston, IL 60208 USA; Northwestern Univ, Dept Biol & Chem Engn, Evanston, IL 60208 USA","Amaral, LAN (reprint author), Northwestern Univ, NICO, Evanston, IL 60208 USA.",amaral@northwestern.edu,"Amaral, Luis/A-4980-2008; Amaral, Luis N./C-5485-2009; Guimera, Roger/C-1727-2008","Amaral, Luis/0000-0002-3762-789X; Guimera, Roger/0000-0002-3597-4310",NIGMS NIH HHS [K25 GM069546-03],,,30,1291,1407,10,142,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,24-Feb,2005,433,7028,,,,,895,900,,10.1038/nature03288,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,899VT,WOS:000227174600050,15729348,No,,,11/20/17

During periods of rapid learning we observed a pronounced deterioration in song structure after night-sleep. The song regained structure after intense morning singing. Daily improvement in similarity to the tutored song occurred during the late phase of this morning recovery; little further improvement occurred thereafter. Furthermore, birds that showed stronger post-sleep deterioration during development achieved a better final imitation. The effect diminished with age. Our experiments showed that these oscillations were not a result of sleep inertia or lack of practice, indicating the possible involvement of an active process, perhaps neural song-replay during sleep. We suggest that these oscillations correspond to competing demands of plasticity and consolidation during learning, creating repeated opportunities to reshape previously learned motor skills.","CUNY City Coll, Dept Biol, New York, NY 10031 USA; Cold Spring Harbor Lab, Cold Spring Harbor, NY 11724 USA; Wesleyan Univ, Dept Biol, Middletown, CT 06459 USA","Deregnaucourt, S (reprint author), CUNY City Coll, Dept Biol, 138Th St & Convent Ave, New York, NY 10031 USA.",sderegna@sci.ccny.cuny.edu,"Galantucci, Bruno/E-5770-2010","Tchernichovski, Ofer/0000-0001-6788-614X",NIDCD NIH HHS [R01 DC004722],,,46,168,170,3,42,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,17-Feb,2005,433,7027,,,,,710,716,,10.1038/nature03275,,7,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,897XH,WOS:000227039200030,15716944,No,,,11/20/17

But this view is based on information about Saturn that is far inferior to what is now available. Here we report ultraviolet images of Saturn, which, when combined with simultaneous Cassini measurements of the solar wind(5) and Saturn kilometric radio emission(6), demonstrate that its aurorae differ morphologically from those of both Earth and Jupiter. Saturn's auroral emissions vary slowly; some features appear in partial corotation whereas others are fixed to the solar wind direction; the auroral oval shifts quickly in latitude; and the aurora is often not centred on the magnetic pole nor closed on itself. In response to a large increase in solar wind dynamic pressure(5) Saturn's aurora brightened dramatically, the brightest auroral emissions moved to higher latitudes, and the dawn side polar regions were filled with intense emissions. The brightening is reminiscent of terrestrial aurorae, but the other two variations are not.

Jupiter's magnetospheric dynamics and aurorae are dominated by processes internal to the jovian system(2), whereas Saturn's magnetosphere has generally been considered to have both internal and solar-wind-driven processes. This hypothesis, however, is tentative because of limited simultaneous solar wind and magnetospheric measurements. Here we report solar wind measurements, immediately upstream of Saturn, over a one-month period. When combined with simultaneous ultraviolet imaging(3) we find that, unlike Jupiter, Saturn's aurorae respond strongly to solar wind conditions. But in contrast to Earth, the main controlling factor appears to be solar wind dynamic pressure and electric field, with the orientation of the interplanetary magnetic field playing a much more limited role.

The radio source also appeared to be fixed near local noon and at the latitude of the ultraviolet aurora(1,2). There have, however, been no observations relating the radio emissions to detailed auroral structures. Here we report measurements of the radio emissions, which, along with high-resolution images of Saturn's ultraviolet auroral emissions(8), suggest that although there are differences in the global morphology of the aurorae, Saturn's radio emissions exhibit an Earth-like correspondence between bright auroral features and the radio emissions.

Recently, stimulated Raman scattering has been used to demonstrate light amplification and lasing in silicon(4-9). However, because of the nonlinear optical loss associated with two-photon absorption (TPA)-induced free carrier absorption (FCA)(10-12), until now lasing has been limited to pulsed operation(8,9.) Here we demonstrate a continuous-wave silicon Raman laser. Specifically, we show that TPA-induced FCA in silicon can be significantly reduced by introducing a reverse-biased p-i-n diode embedded in a silicon waveguide. The laser cavity is formed by coating the facets of the silicon waveguide with multilayer dielectric films. We have demonstrated stable single mode laser output with side-mode suppression of over 55 dB and linewidth of less than 80 MHz. The lasing threshold depends on the p-i-n reverse bias voltage and the laser wavelength can be tuned by adjusting the wavelength of the pump laser.

Traditionally, silica fluxes to soil solutions and stream waters are thought to be controlled by the weathering and subsequent dissolution of silicate minerals(1,2). Rates of mineral dissolution can be enhanced by biological processes(3). But plants also take up considerable quantities of silica from soil solution, which is recycled into the soil from falling litter in a separate soil - plant silica cycle that can be significant in comparison with weathering input and hydrologic output(4-8). Here we analyse soil water in basaltic soils across the Hawaiian islands to assess the relative contributions of weathering and biogenic silica cycling by using the distinct signatures of the two processes in germanium/silicon ratios. Our data imply that most of the silica released to Hawaiian stream water has passed through the biogenic silica pool, whereas direct mineral - water reactions account for a smaller fraction of the stream silica flux. We expect that other systems exhibiting strong Si depletion of the mineral soils and/or high Si uptake rates by biomass will also have strong biological control on silica cycling and export.","Cornell Univ, Dept Earth & Atmospher Sci, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; Boston Univ, Dept Earth Sci, Boston, MA 02215 USA; Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Geog, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA","Derry, LA (reprint author), Cornell Univ, Dept Earth & Atmospher Sci, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",lad9@cornell.edu,,,,,,30,231,248,7,121,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,17-Feb,2005,433,7027,,,,,728,731,,10.1038/nature03299,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,897XH,WOS:000227039200035,15716949,No,,,11/20/17

The resulting crystal preferred orientation has been used extensively to explain the strong seismic anisotropy observed down to 250 km depth(1-4). The rapid decrease of anisotropy below this depth has been interpreted as marking the transition from dislocation to diffusion creep in the upper mantle(5). But new high-pressure experiments suggest that dislocation creep also dominates in the lower part of the upper mantle, but with a different slip direction. Here we show that this high-pressure dislocation creep produces crystal preferred orientations resulting in extremely low seismic anisotropy, consistent with seismological observations below 250 km depth.

(40)Ar/(39)Ar ages on feldspar crystals from pumice clasts within a tuff in Member I below the hominid levels place an older limit of 198 +/- 14 kyr ( weighted mean age 196 +/- 2 kyr) on the hominids. A younger age limit of 104 +/- 7 kyr is provided by feldspars from pumice clasts in a Member III tuff. Geological evidence indicates rapid deposition of each member of the Kibish Formation. Isotopic ages on the Kibish Formation correspond to ages of Mediterranean sapropels, which reflect increased flow of the Nile River, and necessarily increased flow of the Omo River. Thus the (40)Ar/(39)Ar age measurements, together with the sapropel correlations, indicate that the hominid fossils have an age close to the older limit. Our preferred estimate of the age of the Kibish hominids is 195 +/- 5 kyr, making them the earliest well-dated anatomically modern humans yet described.","Australian Natl Univ, Res Sch Earth Sci, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia; Univ Utah, Dept Geol & Geophys, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA; SUNY Stony Brook, Dept Anat Sci, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA","McDougall, I (reprint author), Australian Natl Univ, Res Sch Earth Sci, GPO Box 4, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia.",ian.mcdougall@anu.edu.au,,,,,,29,452,478,1,72,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,17-Feb,2005,433,7027,,,,,733,736,,10.1038/nature03258,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,897XH,WOS:000227039200037,15716951,No,,,11/20/17

Here we propose that climate affects trophic interactions and could be an important mechanism for synchronizing spatially distributed populations. We show that in specific years the size of red grouse populations in northern England either increases or decreases in synchrony. In these years, widespread and correlated climatic conditions during May and July affect populations regionally and influence the density-dependent transmission of the gastrointestinal nematode Trichostrongylus tenuis, a parasite that reduces grouse fecundity(6). This in turn forces grouse populations into synchrony. We conclude that specific climatic events may lead to outbreaks of infectious diseases or pests that may cause dramatic, synchronized changes in the abundance of their hosts.","Penn State Univ, Mueller Lab, Ctr Infect Dis Dynam, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; Univ Glasgow, Div Environm & Evolutionary Biol, Glasgow G12 8QQ, Lanark, Scotland","Cattadori, IM (reprint author), Penn State Univ, Mueller Lab, Ctr Infect Dis Dynam, University Pk, PA 16802 USA.",imc3@psu.edu,,"Haydon, Daniel/0000-0002-1240-1886",,,,29,107,111,1,51,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,17-Feb,2005,433,7027,,,,,737,741,,10.1038/nature03276,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,897XH,WOS:000227039200038,15716952,No,,,11/20/17

Here we show that heterologous expression of human melanopsin in a mouse paraneuronal cell line (Neuro-2a) is sufficient to render these cells photoreceptive. Under such conditions, melanopsin acts as a sensory photopigment, coupled to a native ion channel via a G-protein signalling cascade, to drive physiological light detection. The melanopsin photoresponse relies on the presence of cis-isoforms of retinaldehyde and is selectively sensitive to short-wavelength light. We also present evidence to show that melanopsin functions as a bistable pigment in this system, having an intrinsic photoisomerase regeneration function that is chromatically shifted to longer wavelengths.","Univ Manchester, Fac Life Sci, Manchester M13 9PT, Lancs, England; Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Div Neurosci & Psychol Med, Dept Visual Neurosci, London W6 8RF, England","Lucas, RJ (reprint author), Univ Manchester, Fac Life Sci, Michael Smith Bldg, Manchester M13 9PT, Lancs, England.",robert.lucas@manchester.ac.uk; m.hankins@imperial.ac.uk,"_, __/D-1910-2009",,,,,31,261,270,0,18,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,17-Feb,2005,433,7027,,,,,741,745,,10.1038/nature03344,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,897XH,WOS:000227039200039,15674244,No,,,11/20/17

However, its amino- acid sequence differs from vertebrate photosensory opsins(1,20) and some have suggested that melanopsin may be a photoisomerase, providing retinoid chromophore to an unidentified opsin(3,20). To determine whether melanopsin is a functional sensory photopigment, here we transiently expressed it in HEK293 cells that stably expressed TRPC3 channels. Light triggered a membrane depolarization in these cells and increased intracellular calcium. The light response resembled that of ipRGCs, with almost identical spectral sensitivity (lambda(max) approximate to 479 nm). The phototransduction pathway included Gq or a related G protein, phospholipase C and TRPC3 channels. We conclude that mammalian melanopsin is a functional sensory photopigment, that it is the photopigment of ganglion-cell photoreceptors, and that these photoreceptors may use an invertebrate-like phototransduction cascade.","Brown Univ, Dept Neurosci, Providence, RI 02912 USA; Uniformed Serv Univ Hlth Sci, Dept Anat Physiol & Genet, Bethesda, MD 20814 USA; Uniformed Serv Univ Hlth Sci, Grad Program Neurosci, Bethesda, MD 20814 USA","Berson, DM (reprint author), Brown Univ, Dept Neurosci, Box 1953, Providence, RI 02912 USA.",David_Berson@brown.edu,,,,,,32,257,265,3,23,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,17-Feb,2005,433,7027,,,,,745,749,,10.1038/nature03345,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,897XH,WOS:000227039200040,15674243,No,,,11/20/17

Recently a parallel, non-rod, non-cone photoreceptive pathway, arising from a population of retinal ganglion cells, was discovered in nocturnal rodents(1). These ganglion cells express the putative photopigment melanopsin and by signalling gross changes in light intensity serve the subconscious, 'non-image-forming' functions of circadian photoentrainment and pupil constriction(1-7). Here we show an anatomically distinct population of 'giant', melanopsin-expressing ganglion cells in the primate retina that, in addition to being intrinsically photosensitive, are strongly activated by rods and cones, and display a rare, S-Off, ( L + M)-On type of colour-opponent receptive field. The intrinsic, rod and (L + M) cone-derived light responses combine in these giant cells to signal irradiance over the full dynamic range of human vision. In accordance with cone-based colour opponency, the giant cells project to the lateral geniculate nucleus, the thalamic relay to primary visual cortex. Thus, in the diurnal trichromatic primate, 'non-image-forming' and conventional 'image-forming' retinal pathways are merged, and the melanopsin-based signal might contribute to conscious visual perception.","Univ Washington, Dept Biol Struct, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; Washington Natl Primate Res Ctr, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; Johns Hopkins Univ, Sch Med, Dept Neurosci, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA; Johns Hopkins Univ, Sch Med, Dept Ophthalmol, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA; Univ Chicago, Vis Sci Labs, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; Univ Alabama, Vis Sci Res Ctr, Birmingham, AL 35294 USA","Dacey, DM (reprint author), Univ Washington, Dept Biol Struct, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.",dmd@u.washington.edu,,"Gamlin, Paul/0000-0002-2966-4762; Robinson, Farrel/0000-0002-3903-8327","NEI NIH HHS [R01 EY014596-01, R01 EY006837, R01 EY006837-16A1, R01 EY006837-17, R01 EY006837-18, R01 EY014596, R37 EY006837, R37 EY006837-15, R37 EY006837-15S1]; NIDCD NIH HHS [R01 DC006904, R01 DC006904-01]",,,30,587,608,5,70,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,17-Feb,2005,433,7027,,,,,749,754,,10.1038/nature03387,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,897XH,WOS:000227039200041,15716953,No,,,11/20/17

One possible difference that has emerged is the role of mitochondria. By releasing cytochrome c, mitochondria are involved in the activation of caspases in mammals(3,4). However, there has previously been no evidence that mitochondria are involved in caspase activation in C. elegans. Here we show that mitochondria fragment in cells that normally undergo programmed cell death during C. elegans development. Mitochondrial fragmentation is induced by the BH3-only protein EGL-1 and can be blocked by mutations in the bcl-2-like gene ced-9, indicating that members of the Bcl-2 family might function in the regulation of mitochondrial fragmentation in apoptotic cells. Mitochondrial fragmentation is independent of CED-4/Apaf-1 and CED-3/caspase, indicating that it occurs before or simultaneously with their activation. Furthermore, DRP-1/dynamin-related protein, a key component of the mitochondrial fission machinery, is required and sufficient to induce mitochondrial fragmentation and programmed cell death during C. elegans development. These results assign an important role to mitochondria in the cell-death pathway in C. elegans.","Dartmouth Coll, Sch Med, Dept Genet, Hanover, NH 03755 USA; Univ Bayreuth, D-95440 Bayreuth, Germany; Univ Munich, Inst Physiol Chem, D-81377 Munich, Germany; Max Planck Inst Neurobiol, D-82152 Planegg Martinsried, Germany","Conradt, B (reprint author), Dartmouth Coll, Sch Med, Dept Genet, 7400 Remsen, Hanover, NH 03755 USA.",barbara.conradt@dartmouth.edu,"Westermann, Benedikt/H-7766-2013; Conradt, Barbara/K-2665-2014","Westermann, Benedikt/0000-0002-2991-1604; Grote, Phillip/0000-0002-9254-1458",,,,30,232,244,1,11,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,17-Feb,2005,433,7027,,,,,754,760,,10.1038/nature03316,,7,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,897XH,WOS:000227039200042,15716954,No,,,11/20/17

A decline in skeletal muscle stem cell ( satellite cell) activity due to a loss of Notch signalling results in impaired regeneration of aged muscle(1,6). The decline in hepatic progenitor cell proliferation owing to the formation of a complex involving cEBP-alpha and the chromatin remodelling factor brahma (Brm) inhibits the regenerative capacity of aged liver(7). To examine the influence of systemic factors on aged progenitor cells from these tissues, we established parabiotic pairings ( that is, a shared circulatory system) between young and old mice (heterochronic parabioses), exposing old mice to factors present in young serum. Notably, heterochronic parabiosis restored the activation of Notch signalling as well as the proliferation and regenerative capacity of aged satellite cells. The exposure of satellite cells from old mice to young serum enhanced the expression of the Notch ligand ( Delta), increased Notch activation, and enhanced proliferation in vitro. Furthermore, heterochronic parabiosis increased aged hepatocyte proliferation and restored the cEBP-alpha complex to levels seen in young animals. These results suggest that the age-related decline of progenitor cell activity can be modulated by systemic factors that change with age.","Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Dept Neurol & Neurol Sci, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Dept Pathol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; VA Palo Alto Hlth Care Syst, GRECC, Palo Alto, CA 94304 USA; VA Palo Alto Hlth Care Syst, Neurol Serv, Palo Alto, CA 94304 USA","Rando, TA (reprint author), Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Dept Neurol & Neurol Sci, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",rando@stanford.edu,"Ladoux, Benoit/A-9879-2013",,,,,26,1027,1078,10,109,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,17-Feb,2005,433,7027,,,,,760,764,,10.1038/nature03260,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,897XH,WOS:000227039200043,15716955,No,,,11/20/17

The microphthalmia-associated transcription factor Mitf has a crucial but poorly defined role in melanoblast and melanocyte survival and in differentiation(1). Here we show that Mitf can act as a novel anti-proliferative transcription factor able to induce a G1 cell-cycle arrest that is dependent on Mitf-mediated activation of the p21(Cip1) (CDKN1A) cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor gene. Moreover, cooperation between Mitf and the retinoblastoma protein Rb1 potentiates the ability of Mitf to activate transcription. The results indicate that Mitf-mediated activation of p21(Cip1) expression and consequent hypophosphorylation of Rb1 will contribute to cell cycle exit and activation of the differentiation programme. The mutation of genes associated with melanoma, such as INK4a or BRAF that would affect either Mitf cooperation with Rb1 or Mitf stability respectively, would impair Mitf-mediated cell cycle control.","Inst Curie, CNRS, UMR146, F-91405 Orsay, France","Goding, CR (reprint author), Marie Curie Res Inst, Signalling & Dev Lab, The Chart, Oxted RH8 OTL, Surrey, England.",c.goding@mcri.ac.uk,"la rocca, severina anna/D-8028-2011; Carreira, Suzanne/C-8445-2012; Larue, Lionel/F-7355-2013; Larue, Lionel/I-6532-2016",,,,,30,234,240,0,14,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,17-Feb,2005,433,7027,,,,,764,769,,10.1038/nature03269,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,897XH,WOS:000227039200044,15716956,No,,,11/20/17

In each case, about 100 messages were downregulated after 12 h. The 30 untranslated regions of these messages had a significant propensity to pair to the 50 region of the miRNA, as expected if many of these messages are the direct targets of the miRNAs(3). Our results suggest that metazoan miRNAs can reduce the levels of many of their target transcripts, not just the amount of protein deriving from these transcripts.

Single-molecule experiments(6-9) point towards three catalytic events per turn, in agreement with the molecular structure of the complex(10). The physiological function of F-1 is ATP synthesis. In the ubiquitous F0F1 complex, this energetically uphill reaction is driven by F-0, the partner motor of F-1, which forces the backward ( clockwise) rotation of F-1, leading to ATP synthesis(11-13). Here, we have devised an experiment combining single- molecule manipulation and microfabrication techniques to measure the yield of this mechanochemical transformation. Single F-1 molecules were enclosed in femtolitre-sized hermetic chambers and rotated in a clockwise direction using magnetic tweezers. When the magnetic field was switched off, the F-1 molecule underwent anticlockwise rotation at a speed proportional to the amount of synthesized ATP. At 10 Hz, the mechanochemical coupling efficiency was low for the alpha(3)beta(3)gamma subcomplex (F-1(-epsilon)), but reached up to 77% after reconstitution with the epsilon-subunit (F-1(+epsilon)).

Supermassive black holes are found at the centres of most galaxies today(1 - 3), where their masses are related to the velocity dispersions of stars in their host galaxies and hence to the mass of the central bulge of the galaxy(4,5). This suggests a link between the growth of the black holes and their host galaxies(6 - 9), which has indeed been assumed for a number of years. But the origin of the observed relation between black hole mass and stellar velocity dispersion, and its connection with the evolution of galaxies, have remained unclear. Here we report simulations that simultaneously follow star formation and the growth of black holes during galaxy - galaxy collisions. We find that, in addition to generating a burst of star formation(10), a merger leads to strong inflows that feed gas to the supermassive black hole and thereby power the quasar. The energy released by the quasar expels enough gas to quench both star formation and further black hole growth. This determines the lifetime of the quasar phase ( approaching 100 million years) and explains the relationship between the black hole mass and the stellar velocity dispersion.","Max Planck Inst Astrophys, D-85740 Garching, Germany; Harvard Univ, Dept Astron, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA","Di Matteo, T (reprint author), Carnegie Mellon Univ, Dept Phys, 5000 Forbes Ave, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA.",tiziana@phys.cmu.edu,"Di Matteo, Tiziana/O-4762-2014","Di Matteo, Tiziana/0000-0002-6462-5734",,,,30,1555,1555,3,50,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,10-Feb,2005,433,7026,,,,,604,607,,10.1038/nature03335,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,895KX,WOS:000226862000036,15703739,No,,,11/20/17

Nevertheless, closer inspection of phase diagrams in many manganites reveals complex phases where the two order parameters of magnetism and charge modulation unexpectedly coexist(6,7). Here we show that such experiments can be naturally explained within a phenomenological Ginzburg-Landau theory. In contrast to models where phase separation originates from disorder(8) or as a strain- induced kinetic phenomenon(9), we argue that magnetic and charge modulation coexist in new thermodynamic phases. This leads to a rich diagram of equilibrium phases, qualitatively similar to those seen experimentally. The success of this model argues for a fundamental reinterpretation of the nature of charge modulation in these materials, from a localized to a more extended ' charge- density wave' picture. The same symmetry considerations that favour textured coexistence of charge and magnetic order may apply to many electronic systems with competing phases. The resulting electronically soft' phases of matter with incommensurate, inhomogeneous and mixed order may be general phenomena in correlated systems.","Univ Cambridge, Cavendish Lab, Cambridge CB3 0HE, England","Milward, GC (reprint author), Univ Cambridge, Cavendish Lab, Madingley Rd, Cambridge CB3 0HE, England.",gcm24@cam.ac.uk,"Calderon, Maria Jose/A-4888-2009; Cavendish, TCM/C-9489-2009; Littlewood, Peter/B-7746-2008","Calderon, Maria Jose/0000-0001-5827-4731; ",,,,30,195,197,11,46,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,10-Feb,2005,433,7026,,,,,607,610,,10.1038/nature03300,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,895KX,WOS:000226862000037,15703740,No,,,11/20/17

These reconstructions have mainly used tree- ring data and other data sets of annual to decadal resolution. Lake and ocean sediments have a lower time resolution, but provide climate information at multicentennial timescales that may not be captured by tree- ring data(9,10). Here we reconstruct Northern Hemisphere temperatures for the past 2,000 years by combining low- resolution proxies with tree- ring data, using a wavelet transform technique(11) to achieve timescale- dependent processing of the data. Our reconstruction shows larger multicentennial variability than most previous multi- proxy reconstructions(1 - 4,7), but agrees well with temperatures reconstructed from borehole measurements(12) and with temperatures obtained with a general circulation model(13,14). According to our reconstruction, high temperatures - similar to those observed in the twentieth century before 1990 occurred around AD 1000 to 1100, and minimum temperatures that are about 0.7K below the average of 1961 - 90 occurred around AD 1600. This large natural variability in the past suggests an important role of natural multicentennial variability that is likely to continue.","Stockholm Univ, Dept Meteorol, SE-10691 Stockholm, Sweden; Hydrometeorol Res Ctr Russia, Dynam Stochast Lab, Moscow 123242, Russia; Stockholm Univ, Dept Phys Geog & Quaternary Geol, SE-10691 Stockholm, Sweden","Moberg, A (reprint author), Stockholm Univ, Dept Meteorol, SE-10691 Stockholm, Sweden.",anders.moberg@misu.su.se,,"Sonechkin, Dmitry/0000-0003-3771-3824; Moberg, Anders/0000-0002-5177-9347",,,,30,858,917,9,176,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,10-Feb,2005,433,7026,,,,,613,617,,10.1038/nature03265,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,895KX,WOS:000226862000039,15703742,No,,,11/20/17

According to the prevailing hypothesis, this water flow takes place in a network of tubular conduits(4,5). Here we analyse video images from 48 boreholes drilled into the small Swedish glacier Storglaciaren, showing that the glacier's hydrological system is instead dominated by fractures that convey water at slow speeds. We detected hydraulically connected fractures at all depths, including near the glacier bottom. Our observations indicate that fractures provide the main pathways for surface water to reach deep within the glacier, whereas tubular conduits probably form only in special circumstances. A network of hydraulically linked fractures offers a simple explanation for the origin and evolution of the englacial water flow system and its seasonal regeneration. Such a fracture network also explains radar observations that reveal a complex pattern of echoes rather than a system of conduits.

We tested this assumption on a mycorrhizal fungal community over a period of six years.

The two approaches resulted in different structural and functional community responses to increased [ CO2]. Some fungi were sensitive to the carbon pulse of the abrupt [ CO2] treatment. This resulted in an immediate decline in fungal species richness and a significant change in mycorrhizal functioning. The magnitude of changes in fungal diversity and functioning in response to gradually increasing [ CO2] was smaller, and not significantly different to those with ambient [ CO2].

Smaller workers of C. atratus, and smaller species of Cephalotes more generally, regain contact with their associated tree trunk over shorter vertical distances than do larger workers.

However, no universal trends in ongoing changes of amino acid frequencies have been reported. We compared sets of orthologous proteins encoded by triplets of closely related genomes from 15 taxa representing all three domains of life ( Bacteria, Archaea and Eukaryota), and used phylogenies to polarize amino acid substitutions. Cys, Met, His, Ser and Phe accrue in at least 14 taxa, whereas Pro, Ala, Glu and Gly are consistently lost. The same nine amino acids are currently accrued or lost in human proteins, as shown by analysis of non- synonymous single-nucleotide polymorphisms. All amino acids with declining frequencies are thought to be among the first incorporated into the genetic code; conversely, all amino acids with increasing frequencies, except Ser, were probably recruited late(5 - 7).

In songbirds, the anterior forebrain pathway ( AFP) is a basal ganglia - forebrain circuit required for song learning and adult vocal plasticity but not for production of learned song(2 - 5). Here, we investigate functional contributions of this circuit to the control of song, a complex, learned motor skill. We test the hypothesis that neural activity in the AFP of adult birds can direct moment- by- moment changes in the primary motor areas responsible for generating song. We show that song- triggered microstimulation in the output nucleus of the AFP induces acute and specific changes in learned parameters of song(6,7). Moreover, under both natural and experimental conditions, variability in the pattern of AFP activity is associated with variability in song structure. Finally, lesions of the output nucleus of the AFP prevent naturally occurring modulation of song variability. These findings demonstrate a previously unappreciated capacity of the AFP to direct real- time changes in song. More generally, they suggest that frontal cortical and basal ganglia areas may contribute to motor learning by biasing motor output towards desired targets or by introducing stochastic variability required for reinforcement learning.","Univ Calif San Francisco, Keck Ctr Integrat Neurosci, Dept Physiol, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; Univ Calif San Francisco, Keck Ctr Integrat Neurosci, Dept Psychiat, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA","Kao, MH (reprint author), Univ Calif San Francisco, Keck Ctr Integrat Neurosci, Dept Physiol, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA.",mimi@phy.ucsf.edu,,,,,,30,276,279,0,26,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,10-Feb,2005,433,7026,,,,,638,643,,10.1038/nature03127,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,895KX,WOS:000226862000046,15703748,No,,,11/20/17

In the fruitfly, Drosophila melanogaster, differences between the membranous forewings and the modified hindwings ( halteres) depend on the Hox gene Ultrabithorax ( Ubx). The Drosophila forewings develop without Hox input, while Ubx represses genes that are important for wing development, promoting haltere identity(1,2). However, the idea that Hox input is important to the morphologically specialized wing derivatives such as halteres, and not the more ancestral wings, requires examination in other insect orders. In beetles, such as Tribolium castaneum, it is the forewings that are modified ( to form elytra), while the hindwings retain a morphologically more ancestral identity. Here we show that in this beetle Ubx ' despecializes' the hindwings, which are transformed to elytra when the gene is knocked down. We also show evidence that elytra result from a Hox- free state, despite their diverged morphology. Ubx function in the hindwing seems necessary for a change in the expression of spalt, iroquois and achaete- scute homologues from elytron- like to more typical wing- like patterns. This counteracting effect of Ubx in beetle hindwings represents a previously unknown mode of wing diversification in insects.","Kansas State Univ, Div Biol, Manhattan, KS 66506 USA; Washington Univ, Sch Med, Dept Genet, St Louis, MO 63110 USA","Tomoyasu, Y (reprint author), Kansas State Univ, Div Biol, Chalmers Hall, Manhattan, KS 66506 USA.",tomoyasu@ksu.edu,"Tomoyasu, Yoshinori/D-3061-2017","Tomoyasu, Yoshinori/0000-0001-9824-3454",,,,28,98,102,0,25,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,10-Feb,2005,433,7026,,,,,643,647,,10.1038/nature03272,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,895KX,WOS:000226862000047,15703749,No,,,11/20/17

Tamoxifen- inducible Cre/ lox technology enables selective marking of this progenitor cell population including its progeny, at a defined time, and purification to relative homogeneity.

This is mediated by RAD51, which forms a nucleoprotein filament with the 30 overhanging single- stranded DNA ( ssDNA) of the resected DSB, searches for a homologous donor sequence, and catalyses strand exchange with the donor DNA(4). The 3,418- amino- acid BRCA2 contains eight similar to 30- amino-acid BRC repeats that bind RAD51 ( refs 5, 6) and a similar to 700- amino-acid DBD domain that binds ssDNA(7). The isolated BRC and DBD domains have the opposing effects of inhibiting(8,9) and stimulating recombination(7), respectively, and the role of BRCA2 in repair has been unclear. Here we show that a full- length BRCA2 homologue ( Brh2) stimulates Rad51- mediated recombination at substoichiometric concentrations relative to Rad51. Brh2 recruits Rad51 to DNA and facilitates the nucleation of the filament, which is then elongated by the pool of free Rad51.

The 50 side is processed ( matured) by the ubiquitously conserved endonucleolytic ribozyme, RNase P-1, whereas removal of the 30 tails can be either exonucleolytic(2,3) or endonucleolytic(4). The endonucleolytic pathway is catalysed by an enzyme known as RNase Z, or 3' tRNase(5,6). RNase Z cleaves precursor tRNAs immediately after the discriminator base ( the unpaired nucleotide 30 to the last base pair of the acceptor stem, used as an identity determinant by many aminoacyl- tRNA synthetases) in most cases(6 - 8), yielding a tRNA primed for addition of the CCA motif by nucleotidyl transferase. Here we report the crystal structure of Bacillus subtilis RNase Z at 2.1 Angstrom resolution, and propose a mechanism for tRNA recognition and cleavage. The structure explains the allosteric properties of the enzyme, and also sheds light on the mechanisms of inhibition by the CCA motif and long 50 extensions.

Here we identify one of the molecular mechanisms that contributes to the evolutionary gain of a male-specific wing pigmentation spot in Drosophila biarmipes, a species closely related to Drosophila melanogaster. We show that the evolution of this spot involved modifications of an ancestral cis-regulatory element of the yellow pigmentation gene. This element has gained multiple binding sites for transcription factors that are deeply conserved components of the regulatory landscape controlling wing development, including the selector protein Engrailed. The evolutionary stability of components of regulatory landscapes, which can be co-opted by chance mutations in cis-regulatory elements, might explain the repeated evolution of similar morphological patterns, such as wing pigmentation patterns in flies.","Univ Wisconsin, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Madison, WI 53706 USA; Univ Wisconsin, Mol Biol Lab, Madison, WI 53706 USA","Carroll, SB (reprint author), Univ Wisconsin, Howard Hughes Med Inst, 1525 Linden Dr, Madison, WI 53706 USA.",sbcarrol@wisc.edu,"Phelps, Steve/H-2263-2011",,,,,47,356,373,2,68,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,3-Feb,2005,433,7025,,,,,481,487,,10.1038/nature03235,,7,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,893NT,WOS:000226727200038,15690032,No,,,11/20/17

Whereas linear systems allow superposition, nonlinearity introduces a non-trivial interplay between localization effects, coupling between lattice sites, and incoherence. Until recently, all research on solitary waves (solitons) in nonlinear lattices has involved only coherent waves. In such cases, linear dispersion or diffraction of wave packets can be balanced by nonlinear effects, resulting in coherent lattice ( or 'discrete') solitons(1,2); these have been studied in many branches of science(3-11). However, in most natural systems, waves with only partial coherence are more common, because fluctuations ( thermal, quantum or some other) can reduce the correlation length to a distance comparable to the lattice spacing. Such systems should support random-phase lattice solitons displaying distinct features(12). Here we report the experimental observation of randomphase lattice solitons, demonstrating their self-trapping and local periodicity in real space, in addition to their multi-peaked power spectrum in momentum space. We discuss the relevance of such solitons to other nonlinear periodic systems in which fluctuating waves propagate, such as atomic systems, plasmas and molecular chains.","Technion Israel Inst Technol, Dept Phys, IL-32000 Haifa, Israel; Technion Israel Inst Technol, Inst Solid State, IL-32000 Haifa, Israel; Univ Zagreb, Dept Phys, Zagreb 10000, Croatia; Princeton Univ, Dept Elect Engn, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; Univ Cent Florida, CREOL, Sch Opt, Orlando, FL 32816 USA","Segev, M (reprint author), Technion Israel Inst Technol, Dept Phys, IL-32000 Haifa, Israel.",msegev@tx.technion.ac.il,"Buljan, Hrvoje/L-9155-2013","Buljan, Hrvoje/0000-0002-9808-6628",,,,30,74,75,2,11,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,3-Feb,2005,433,7025,,,,,500,503,,10.1038/nature03267,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,893NT,WOS:000226727200042,15690035,No,,,11/20/17

Adiabatic potential-energy surfaces - usually derived using quantum chemical methods(3) that assume mutually independent nuclear and electronic motion(4) - quantify the fundamental forces between atoms involved in reaction and thus provide accurate descriptions of a reacting system as it moves through its transition state(5,6). This approach, widely tested for gas-phase reactions(7), is now also commonly applied to chemical reactions at metal surfaces(8). There is, however, some evidence calling into question the correctness of this theoretical approach for surface reactions: electronic excitation upon highly exothermic chemisorption has been observed(9), and indirect evidence suggests that large-amplitude vibrations of reactant molecules can excite electrons at metal surfaces(10,11). Here we report the detection of 'hot' electrons leaving a metal surface as vibrationally highly excited NO molecules collide with it. Electron emission only occurs once the vibrational energy exceeds the surface work function, and is at least 10,000 times more efficient than the emissions seen in similar systems where large-amplitude vibrations were not involved(12-18). These observations unambiguously demonstrate the direct conversion of vibrational to electronic excitation, thus questioning one of the basic assumptions currently used in theoretical approaches to describing bond-dissociation at metal surfaces.","Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Chem & Biochem, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; Hitachi Global Storage Technol, San Jose, CA 95120 USA","Wodtke, AM (reprint author), Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Chem & Biochem, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA.",wodtke@chem.ucsb.edu,"Wodtke, Alec/I-4848-2012; Auerbach, Daniel/J-7109-2014","Auerbach, Daniel/0000-0001-9494-3066; Wodtke, Alec/0000-0002-6509-2183",,,,24,131,131,5,56,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,3-Feb,2005,433,7025,,,,,503,505,,10.1038/nature03213,,3,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,893NT,WOS:000226727200043,15690036,No,,,11/20/17

Subsequently, its atmospheric concentration has declined steadily(2-4) and recent European methyl chloroform consumption and emissions were estimated to be less than 0.1 gigagrams per year(1,5). However, data from a short-term tropospheric measurement campaign ( EXPORT) indicated that European methyl chloroform emissions could have been over 20 gigagrams in 2000 (ref. 6), almost doubling previously estimated global emissions(1,4). Such enhanced emissions would significantly affect results from the CH3CCl3 method of deriving global abundances of hydroxyl radicals ( OH) (refs 7 - 12) - the dominant reactive atmospheric chemical for removing trace gases related to air pollution, ozone depletion and the greenhouse effect. Here we use long-term, high-frequency data from MaceHead, Ireland and Jungfraujoch, Switzerland, to infer European methyl chloroform emissions. We find that European emission estimates declined from about 60 gigagrams per year in the mid-1990s to 0.3 - 1.4 and 1.9 - 3.4 gigagrams per year in 2000 - 03, based on Mace Head and Jungfraujoch data, respectively.

Some of these differences may be reconciled by observations of radial anisotropy between 250 and 300 km depth, with horizontally polarized shear waves travelling faster than vertically polarized ones(2). This azimuthally averaged anisotropy could arise from present-day deformation at the base of the plate, as has been found for shallower depths beneath ocean basins(6). Such deformation would also produce significant azimuthal variation, owing to the preferred alignment of highly anisotropic minerals(7). Here we report global observations of surface-wave azimuthal anisotropy, which indicate that only the continental portion of the Australian plate displays significant azimuthal anisotropy and strong correlation with present-day plate motion in the depth range 175 - 300 km. Beneath other continents, azimuthal anisotropy is only weakly correlated with plate motion and its depth location is similar to that found beneath oceans. We infer that the fast-moving Australian plate contains the only continental region with a sufficiently large deformation at its base to be transformed into azimuthal anisotropy. Simple shear leading to anisotropy with a plunging axis of symmetry may explain the smaller azimuthal anisotropy beneath other continents.","Ctr Natl Rech Sci, Ecole & Observ Sci Terre, Inst Phys Globe Strasbourg, F-61084 Strasbourg, France; Univ Strasbourg 1, F-61084 Strasbourg, France; Australian Natl Univ, Res Sch Earth Sci, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia; Univ Cambridge, Bullard Labs, Cambridge CB3 0EZ, England","Debayle, E (reprint author), Ctr Natl Rech Sci, Ecole & Observ Sci Terre, Inst Phys Globe Strasbourg, F-61084 Strasbourg, France.",Eric.Debayle@eost.u-strasbg.fr,"Debayle, Eric/D-3738-2012","Debayle, Eric/0000-0002-9438-7060; Kennett, Brian/0000-0003-2206-5350",,,,31,192,202,0,21,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,3-Feb,2005,433,7025,,,,,509,512,,10.1038/nature03247,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,893NT,WOS:000226727200045,15690038,No,,,11/20/17

We reveal that the larger the group the smaller the proportion of informed individuals needed to guide the group, and that only a very small proportion of informed individuals is required to achieve great accuracy.

Despite their relatively high metabolic rate, many insects have highly discontinuous patterns of gas exchange, including long periods when the spiracles are fully closed. Two explanations have previously been put forward to explain this behaviour: first, that this pattern serves to reduce respiratory water loss(1), and second, that the pattern may have initially evolved in underground insects as a way of dealing with hypoxic or hypercapnic conditions(2). Here we propose a third possible explanation based on the idea that oxygen is necessary for oxidative metabolism but also acts as a toxic chemical that can cause oxidative damage of tissues even at relatively low concentrations. At physiologically normal partial pressures of CO2, the rate of CO2 diffusion out of the insect respiratory system is slower than the rate of O-2 entry; this leads to a build-up of intratracheal CO2. The spiracles must therefore be opened at intervals to rid the insect of accumulated CO2, a process that exposes the tissues to dangerously high levels of O-2. We suggest that the cyclical pattern of open and closed spiracles observed in resting insects is a necessary consequence of the need to rid the respiratory system of accumulated CO2, followed by the need to reduce oxygen toxicity.","Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Irvine, CA 92697 USA; Humboldt Univ, Dept Anim Physiol, D-10115 Berlin, Germany","Bradley, TJ (reprint author), Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Irvine, CA 92697 USA.",tbradley@uci.edu,"Hetz, Stefan/E-9094-2010","Hetz, Stefan/0000-0002-4928-8506",,,,30,181,191,0,62,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,3-Feb,2005,433,7025,,,,,516,519,,10.1038/nature03106,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,893NT,WOS:000226727200047,15690040,No,,,11/20/17

Prey profitability ( energy gained divided by prey handling time) is an essential variable for estimating the optimal diet. Time constraints of capturing and consuming prey generally result in handling times ranging from minutes to seconds, yet profitability increases dramatically as handling time approaches zero, providing the potential for strong directional selection for increasing predator speed at high encounter rates ( tiny increments in speed increase profitability markedly, allowing expanded diets of smaller prey). We provide evidence that the unusual anatomical and behavioural specializations characterizing star-nosed moles resulted from progressively stronger selection for speed, allowing the progressive addition of small prey to their diet. Here we report handling times as short as 120 ms (mean 227 ms) for moles identifying and eating prey. 'Double takes' during prey identification suggest that star-nosed moles have reached the speed limit for processing tactile information. The exceptional speed of star-nosed moles, coupled with unusual specializations for finding and eating tiny prey, provide new support for optimal foraging theory.","Vanderbilt Univ, Dept Biol Sci, VU Stn B, Nashville, TN 37235 USA","Catania, KC (reprint author), Vanderbilt Univ, Dept Biol Sci, VU Stn B, Box 351634, Nashville, TN 37235 USA.",ken.catania@Vanderbilt.edu,,,,,,20,45,47,1,34,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,3-Feb,2005,433,7025,,,,,519,522,,10.1038/nature03250,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,893NT,WOS:000226727200048,15690041,No,,,11/20/17

Because daumone is a key regulator of chemosensory processes in development and ageing(5,6), the chemical identification of daumone is important for elucidating features of the daumone-mediated signalling pathway. Here we report the isolation of natural daumone from C. elegans by large-scale purification, as well as the total chemical synthesis of daumone. We present the stereospecific chemical structure of purified daumone, a fatty acid derivative. We demonstrate that both natural and chemically synthesized daumones equally induce dauer larva formation in C. elegans (N2 strain) and certain dauer mutants, and also result in competition between food and daumone.

In vitro, Spire nucleates new filaments at a rate that is similar to that of the formin family of proteins but slower than in the activated Arp2/3 complex, and it remains associated with the slow-growing pointed end of the new filament. Spire contains a cluster of four WASP homology 2 (WH2) domains, each of which binds an actin monomer. Maximal nucleation activity requires all four WH2 domains along with an additional actin-binding motif, conserved among Spire proteins.

J,"Song, CM; Havlin, S; Makse, HA",,,,"Song, CM; Havlin, S; Makse, HA",,,Self-similarity of complex networks,NATURE,,,English,Article,,,,,,,INTERNET,"Complex networks have been studied extensively owing to their relevance to many real systems such as the world-wide web, the Internet, energy landscapes and biological and social networks(1-5). A large number of real networks are referred to as 'scale-free' because they show a power-law distribution of the number of links per node(1,6,7). However, it is widely believed that complex networks are not invariant or self-similar under a length-scale transformation. This conclusion originates from the 'small-world' property of these networks, which implies that the number of nodes increases exponentially with the 'diameter' of the network(8-11), rather than the power-law relation expected for a self-similar structure. Here we analyse a variety of real complex networks and find that, on the contrary, they consist of self-repeating patterns on all length scales. This result is achieved by the application of a renormalization procedure that coarse-grains the system into boxes containing nodes within a given 'size'. We identify a power-law relation between the number of boxes needed to cover the network and the size of the box, defining a finite self-similar exponent. These fundamental properties help to explain the scale-free nature of complex networks and suggest a common self-organization dynamics.","CUNY City Coll, Levich Inst, New York, NY 10031 USA; CUNY City Coll, Dept Phys, New York, NY 10031 USA; Bar Ilan Univ, Minerva Ctr, IL-52900 Ramat Gan, Israel; Bar Ilan Univ, Dept Phys, IL-52900 Ramat Gan, Israel","Makse, HA (reprint author), CUNY City Coll, Levich Inst, New York, NY 10031 USA.",makse@mailaps.org,,,,,,19,580,621,4,113,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,27-Jan,2005,433,7024,,,,,392,395,,10.1038/nature03248,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,890XZ,WOS:000226546200036,15674285,No,,,11/20/17

These include the enhancement of polarization by strain(1,2) and the possibility of asymmetric properties in three-component superlattices(3). Here we fabricate superlattices consisting of barium titanate (BaTiO3), strontium titanate (SrTiO3) and calcium titanate (CaTiO3) with atomic-scale control by high-pressure pulsed laser deposition on conducting, atomically flat strontium ruthenate (SrRuO3) layers. The strain in BaTiO3 layers is fully maintained as long as the BaTiO3 thickness does not exceed the combined thicknesses of the CaTiO3 and SrTiO3 layers. By preserving full strain and combining heterointerfacial couplings, we find an overall 50% enhancement of the superlattice global polarization with respect to similarly grown pure BaTiO3, despite the fact that half the layers in the superlattice are nominally nonferroelectric. We further show that even superlattices containing only single-unit-cell layers of BaTiO3 in a paraelectric matrix remain ferroelectric. Our data reveal that the specific interface structure and local asymmetries play an unexpected role in the polarization enhancement.","Oak Ridge Natl Lab, Condensed Matter Sci Div, Oak Ridge, TN 37831 USA","Lee, HN (reprint author), Oak Ridge Natl Lab, Condensed Matter Sci Div, Oak Ridge, TN 37831 USA.",hnlee@ornl.gov,"Kim, Yu Jin/A-2433-2012; Christen, Hans/H-6551-2013; Lee, Ho Nyung/K-2820-2012; Rouleau, Christopher/Q-2737-2015; Chisholm, Matthew/F-7198-2017","Christen, Hans/0000-0001-8187-7469; Lee, Ho Nyung/0000-0002-2180-3975; Rouleau, Christopher/0000-0002-5488-3537; Chisholm, Matthew/0000-0003-0546-5109",,,,23,470,474,27,302,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,27-Jan,2005,433,7024,,,,,395,399,,10.1038/nature03261,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,890XZ,WOS:000226546200037,15674286,No,,,11/20/17

It is an important nutrient for phytoplankton(1) and is readily absorbed by terrestrial vegetation(2); it also assists the removal of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere through the weathering of silicates(3). But the continental cycle of silicon is not well known, and only a few studies have attempted to use silicon stable isotopes (Si-28, Si-29 and Si-30)(4-13) to quantify the continental silicon reservoirs. Dissolved silicon in sea and river waters forms a reservoir of mean isotopic value 11.1parts per thousand (refs 7, 10). It is enriched in Si-30 with respect to the igneous rocks reservoir, which has a mean isotopic value of -0.3parts per thousand (refs 4, 9). This enrichment can only be produced by a major fractionation during weathering, and should result in the formation of a continental Si-30-depleted reservoir. Such a reservoir, however, has not been identified to date. Here we analyse silicon isotopes of in situ quartz from a sandstone series in France, using a new-generation secondary ion mass spectrometry apparatus. We show that quartz that precipitates as siliceous cements forms a strongly Si-30-depleted reservoir with isotopic values down to -5.7parts per thousand, a more negative value than any previously published for terrestrial samples. Our findings suggest that quartz re-precipitation plays an important role in the biogeochemical cycle of silicon.","IRD Reunion, LSTUR, F-97492 St Denis, France; Univ Paul Cezanne, IRD, Europole Arbois, CEREGE UMR CNRS, F-13545 Aix En Provence 4, France","Basile-Doelsch, I (reprint author), IRD Reunion, LSTUR, UR037,BP 172, F-97492 St Denis, France.",basile@cerege.fr,"Basile, Isabelle/B-4173-2010; Shrestha, Yesha/N-8890-2014",,,,,30,113,121,2,41,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,27-Jan,2005,433,7024,,,,,399,402,,10.1038/nature03217,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,890XZ,WOS:000226546200038,15674287,No,,,11/20/17

Whether they are generated by the effervescent disruption of fast-rising bubbly melt(2-5) or by the separate ascent of a bubble foam layer accumulated at depth(6,7) still remains a matter of debate(8). No field measurement has yet allowed firm discrimination between these two models. A key insight into the origin of lava fountains may be gained by measuring the chemical composition of the driving gas phase. This composition should differ markedly depending on whether the magma degassing occurs before or during eruption(9,10). Here we report the analysis of magmatic gas during a powerful (250 - 600 m high) lava fountain, measured with Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy(11-14) on Mount Etna, Sicily. The abundances of volcanic gas species, determined from absorption spectra of lava radiation, reveal a fountain gas having higher CO2/S and S/Cl ratios than other etnean emissions(14-18), and which cannot derive from syn-eruptive bulk degassing of Etna basalt(19,20). Instead, its composition suggests violent emptying of a gas bubble layer previously accumulated at about 1.5 km depth below the erupting crater.","INGV, I-95123 Catania, Italy; CE Saclay, CEA, CNRS, Lab Pierre Sue, F-91191 Gif Sur Yvette, France","Allard, P (reprint author), INGV, Piazza Roma 2, I-95123 Catania, Italy.",patrick.allard@cea.fr,"Burton, Mike/B-5716-2014; ALLARD, Patrick/H-9480-2017","Burton, Mike/0000-0003-3779-4812; ALLARD, Patrick/0000-0001-7836-3117",,,,28,146,147,2,19,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,27-Jan,2005,433,7024,,,,,407,410,,10.1038/nature03246,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,890XZ,WOS:000226546200040,15674289,No,,,11/20/17

It remains unclear, however, whether this diversity - stability relationship can be scaled up to regional scales, or to longer timescales(5). Without empirical validation at larger scales, the implications of the diversity - stability relationship for both ecology and long-term conservation strategies cannot readily be resolved. Here I show that in biogenic reefs, ecological stability is related to taxonomic diversity on million-year timescales. The higher the mean reef diversity in a particular time interval, the smaller the change in skeletal density, style of reef building and biotic reef types in the subsequent time interval. Because the relationships apply to a wide spectrum of disturbance regimes and reef types, these results support the hypothesis that species richness itself promotes ecological stability(3). Carbonate production by reefs, while closely correlated with reef diversity without temporal lag, is not stabilized by reef diversity over these long timescales. This suggests that ecological stability and productivity may be decoupled in natural ecosystems.","Humboldt Univ, Museum Nat Hist, D-10115 Berlin, Germany","Kiessling, W (reprint author), Humboldt Univ, Museum Nat Hist, Invalidenstr 43, D-10115 Berlin, Germany.",wolfgang.kiessling@museum.hu-berlin.de,"Kiessling, Wolfgang/E-2259-2015","Kiessling, Wolfgang/0000-0002-1088-2014",,,,27,52,57,3,21,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,27-Jan,2005,433,7024,,,,,410,413,,10.1038/nature03152,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,890XZ,WOS:000226546200041,15674290,No,,,11/20/17

However, this stabilizing mechanism has rarely been tested, and was recently rejected as an explanation for maintaining diversity in natural populations of the freshwater herbivore Daphnia pulex(3). The primary limitation of competition theory is its failure to account for the alternative types of population cycles that are caused by size- or stage-dependent population vital rates - even though such structure both explains the fluctuating dynamics of many species(4) and may alter the outcome of competition(5). Here we provide the first experimental test of whether alternative types of cycles affect natural selection in predator - prey systems. Using competing Daphnia genotypes, we show that internally generated, stage-structured cycles substantially reduce the magnitude of selection ( thereby contributing to the maintenance of genetic diversity), whereas externally forced cycles show rapid competitive exclusion. The change in selection is ecologically significant, spanning the observed range in natural populations(3). We argue that structured cycles reduce selection through a combination of stalled juvenile development and stage-specific mortality. This potentially general fitness-equalizing mechanism may reduce the need for strong stabilizing mechanisms to explain the maintenance of genetic diversity in natural systems.","Univ Calgary, Div Ecol, Calgary, AB T2N 1N4, Canada; Univ Victoria, Natl Water Res Inst, Water & Climate Impacts Res Ctr, Victoria, BC V8W 3P5, Canada","Nelson, WA (reprint author), Univ Calgary, Div Ecol, Calgary, AB T2N 1N4, Canada.",wanelson@ucalgary.ca,"Nelson, William/D-1405-2013; Wrona, Frederick/B-8258-2014","Wrona, Frederick/0000-0003-1894-351X",,,,28,32,33,2,36,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,27-Jan,2005,433,7024,,,,,413,417,,10.1038/nature03212,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,890XZ,WOS:000226546200042,15674291,No,,,11/20/17

Repeated epidemics of primary and secondary syphilis infection in the United States over the past 50 yr have previously been attributed to social and behavioural changes(3). Here, we show that these epidemics represent a rare example of unforced, endogenous oscillations in disease incidence, with an 8-11-yr period that is predicted by the natural dynamics of syphilis infection, to which there is partially protective immunity(4). This conclusion is supported by the absence of oscillations in gonorrhoea cases, where a protective immune response is absent(5,6). We further demonstrate increased synchrony of syphilis oscillations across cities over time, providing empirical evidence for an increasingly connected sexual network in the United States.","Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Dept Infect Dis Epidemiol, London W2 1PG, England","Grassly, NC (reprint author), Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Dept Infect Dis Epidemiol, Norfolk Pl, London W2 1PG, England.",n.grassly@imperial.ac.uk,"Garnett, Geoffrey/A-9312-2008; Grassly, Nicholas/C-6381-2008; Fraser, Christophe/A-8109-2008","Fraser, Christophe/0000-0003-2399-9657; Grassly, Nicholas/0000-0001-6067-4507",,,,30,112,117,0,17,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,27-Jan,2005,433,7024,,,,,417,421,,10.1038/nature03072,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,890XZ,WOS:000226546200043,15674292,No,,,11/20/17

Here we complement these studies by considering the post-stimulation mechanical aspects of Venus flytrap closure. Using high-speed video imaging, non-invasive microscopy techniques and a simple theoretical model, we show that the fast closure of the trap results from a snap-buckling instability, the onset of which is controlled actively by the plant.

These retroelements spread into our ancestral genome millions of years ago and have acted as a driving force for genome evolution(2-4). Endogenous retroviruses may also be deleterious for their host, and have been implicated in cancers and autoimmune diseases(5). Most retroelements have lost replication competence because of the accumulation of inactivating mutations, but several, including some murine intracisternal A-particle (IAP) and MusD sequences, are still mobile(6,7). These elements encode a reverse transcriptase activity and move by retrotransposition, an intracellular copy-and-paste process involving an RNA intermediate. The host has developed mechanisms to silence their expression, mainly cosuppression and gene methylation(4,8). Here we identify another level of antiviral control, mediated by APOBEC3G, a member of the cytidine deaminase family that was previously shown to block HIV replication(9-12). We show that APOBEC3G markedly inhibits retrotransposition of IAP and MusD elements, and induces G-to-A hypermutations in their DNA copies.

Recent studies have identified effector proteins that recognize patterns of histone modification and transduce their function in downstream processes(2). For example, histone acetyltransferases (HATs) have been shown to participate in many essential cellular processes, particularly those associated with activation of transcription(3). Yeast SAGA (Spt-Ada-Gcn5 acetyltransferase) and SLIK (SAGA-like) are two highly homologous and conserved multi-subunit HAT complexes, which preferentially acetylate histones H3 and H2B and deubiquitinate histone H2B. Here we identify the chromatin remodelling protein Chd1 (chromo-ATPase/helicase-DNAbinding domain 1) as a component of SAGA and SLIK. Our findings indicate that one of the two chromodomains of Chd1 specifically interacts with the methylated lysine 4 mark on histone H3 that is associated with transcriptional activity. Furthermore, the SLIK complex shows enhanced acetylation of a methylated substrate and this activity is dependent upon a functional methyl-binding chromodomain, both in vitro and in vivo. Our study identifies the first chromodomain that recognizes methylated histone H3 (Lys 4) and possibly identifies a larger subfamily of chromodomain proteins with similar recognition properties.","Univ Virginia, Sch Med, Dept Biochem & Mol Genet, Charlottesville, VA 22908 USA; Diversa Corp, San Diego, CA 92121 USA; Scripps Res Inst, Dept Cell Biol, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA","Grant, PA (reprint author), Univ Virginia, Sch Med, Dept Biochem & Mol Genet, Charlottesville, VA 22908 USA.",pag9n@virginia.edu,"Daniel, Jeremy/S-4729-2016","Daniel, Jeremy/0000-0002-1981-5571",,,,30,325,353,1,13,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,27-Jan,2005,433,7024,,,,,434,438,,10.1038/nature03242,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,890XZ,WOS:000226546200047,15647753,No,,,11/20/17

It acts through a G-protein-coupled receptor on the surface of target cells to stimulate testicular and ovarian functions. We present here the 2.9-Angstrom-resolution structure of a partially deglycosylated complex of human FSH bound to the extracellular hormone-binding domain of its receptor (FSHRHB). The hormone is bound in a hand-clasp fashion to an elongated, curved receptor. The buried interface of the complex is large (2,600 Angstrom(2)) and has a high charge density. Our analysis suggests that all glycoprotein hormones bind to their receptors in this mode and that binding specificity is mediated by key interaction sites involving both the common alpha- and hormone-specific beta-subunits. On binding, FSH undergoes a concerted conformational change that affects protruding loops implicated in receptor activation. The FSH-FSHRHB complexes form dimers in the crystal and at high concentrations in solution. Such dimers may participate in transmembrane signal transduction.","Columbia Univ, Dept Biochem & Mol Biophys, New York, NY 10032 USA; Columbia Univ, Howard Hughes Med Inst, New York, NY 10032 USA","Hendrickson, WA (reprint author), Columbia Univ, Dept Biochem & Mol Biophys, 630 W 168th St, New York, NY 10032 USA.",wayne@convex.hhmi.columbia.edu,,,NIGMS NIH HHS [R01 GM068671],,,50,354,370,1,23,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,20-Jan,2005,433,7023,,,,,269,277,,10.1038/nature03206,,9,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,888NK,WOS:000226381300045,15662415,No,,,11/20/17

However, the molecular mechanisms by which transcriptional derepression would be linked to tumour suppression are poorly understood. Here we identify the transcriptional repressor Pokemon (encoded by the Zbtb7 gene) as a critical factor in oncogenesis. Mouse embryonic fibroblasts lacking Zbtb7 are completely refractory to oncogene-mediated cellular transformation. Conversely, Pokemon overexpression leads to overt oncogenic transformation both in vitro and in vivo in transgenic mice. Pokemon can specifically repress the transcription of the tumour suppressor gene ARF through direct binding. We find that Pokemon is aberrantly overexpressed in human cancers and that its expression levels predict biological behaviour and clinical outcome. Pokemon's critical role in cellular transformation makes it an attractive target for therapeutic intervention.","Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Sloan Kettering Inst, Canc Biol & Genet Program, New York, NY 10021 USA; Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Sloan Kettering Inst, Dept Pathol, New York, NY 10021 USA; Inst Canc Res, Chester Beatty Labs, Leukaemia Res Fund Ctr, London SW3 6JB, England","Pandolfi, PP (reprint author), Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Sloan Kettering Inst, Canc Biol & Genet Program, 1275 York Ave, New York, NY 10021 USA.",p-pandolfi@ski.mskcc.org,"Zelent, Arthur/B-3532-2009","Hobbs, Robin/0000-0002-3853-2614",NCI NIH HHS [R01 CA102142],,,49,213,262,4,42,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,20-Jan,2005,433,7023,,,,,278,285,,10.1038/nature03203,,8,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,888NK,WOS:000226381300046,15662416,No,,,11/20/17

In general, astronomers estimate stellar masses by determining the luminosity and using the 'mass-luminosity' relationship(1,2), but this relationship has never been accurately calibrated for young, low-mass stars and brown dwarfs(3). Masses for these low-mass objects are therefore constrained only by theoretical models(1,2). A new high-contrast adaptive optics camera(4-6) enabled the discovery of a young ( 50 million years) companion only 0.156 arcseconds (2.3 AU) from the more luminous (>120 times brighter) star AB Doradus A. Here we report a dynamical determination of the mass of the newly resolved low-mass companion AB Dor C, whose mass is 0.090 +/- 0.005 solar masses. Given its measured 1-2- micrometre luminosity, we have found that the standard mass-luminosity relations(1,2) overestimate the near-infrared luminosity of such objects by about a factor of similar to2.5 at young ages. The young, cool objects hitherto thought to be substellar in mass are therefore about twice as massive, which means that the frequency of brown dwarfs and planetary mass objects in young stellar clusters has been overestimated.","Univ Arizona, Steward Observ, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA; Max Planck Inst Astron, D-69117 Heidelberg, Germany; Univ Valencia, Dept Astron & Astrofis, E-46100 Valencia, Spain; European So Observ, Santiago 19, Chile","Close, LM (reprint author), Univ Arizona, Steward Observ, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA.",lclose@as.arizona.edu,,"Biller, Beth/0000-0003-4614-7035; Nielsen, Eric/0000-0001-6975-9056",,,,30,121,121,0,2,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,20-Jan,2005,433,7023,,,,,286,289,,10.1038/nature03225,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,888NK,WOS:000226381300047,15662417,No,,,11/20/17

On the basis of periodicities in the dust impact rate, Jupiter's moon Io was found to be the dominant source of the streams(3). The grains become positively charged within the plasma environment of Jupiter's magnetosphere, and gain energy from its co-rotational electric field(4). Outside the magnetosphere, the dynamics of the grains are governed by the interaction with the interplanetary magnetic field that eventually forms the streams(5). A similar process was suggested for Saturn(6). Here we report the discovery by the Cassini spacecraft of bursts of high-velocity dust particles (greater than or equal to100 km s(-1)) within similar to70 million kilometres of Saturn. Most of the particles detected at large distances appear to originate from the outskirts of Saturn's outermost main ring.

Because of its indirect bandgap, bulk silicon shows very inefficient band-to-band radiative electron-hole recombination. Light emission in silicon has thus focused on the use of silicon engineered materials such as nanocrystals(2-5), Si/SiO2 superlattices(6), erbium-doped silicon-rich oxides(7-10), surface-textured bulk silicon(11) and Si/SiGe quantum cascade structures(12). Stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) has recently been demonstrated as a mechanism to generate optical gain in planar silicon waveguide structures(13-21). In fact, net optical gain in the range 2-11 dB due to SRS has been reported in centimetre-sized silicon waveguides using pulsed pumping(18-21). Recently, a lasing experiment involving silicon as the gain medium by way of SRS was reported, where the ring laser cavity was formed by an 8-m-long optical fibre(22). Here we report the experimental demonstration of Raman lasing in a compact, all-silicon, waveguide cavity on a single silicon chip. This demonstration represents an important step towards producing practical continuous-wave optical amplifiers and lasers that could be integrated with other optoelectronic components onto CMOS-compatible silicon chips.","Intel Corp, Santa Clara, CA 95054 USA; Intel Corp, IL-91031 Jerusalem, Israel","Rong, HS (reprint author), Intel Corp, 2200 Mission Coll Blvd,CHP3-109, Santa Clara, CA 95054 USA.",haisheng.rong@intel.com,,,,,,27,601,630,18,212,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,20-Jan,2005,433,7023,,,,,292,294,,10.1038/nature03273,,3,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,888NK,WOS:000226381300049,15635371,No,,,11/20/17

This mid-Pleistocene climate transition has been attributed to global cooling, possibly caused by a decrease in atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations(1,2). However, evidence for such cooling is currently restricted to the cool upwelling regions in the eastern equatorial oceans(3,4), although the tropical warm pools on the western side of the ocean basins are particularly sensitive to changes in radiative forcing(5,6). Here we present high-resolution records of sea surface temperatures spanning the past 1.75 million years, obtained from oxygen isotopes and Mg/Ca ratios in planktonic foraminifera from the western Pacific warm pool. In contrast with the eastern equatorial regions, sea surface temperatures in the western Pacific warm pool are relatively stable throughout the Pleistocene epoch, implying little long-term change in the tropical net radiation budget. Our results challenge the hypothesis of a gradual decrease in atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations as a dominant trigger of the longer glacial cycles since 850,000 years ago. Instead, we infer that the temperature contrast across the equatorial Pacific Ocean increased, which might have had a significant influence on the mid-Pleistocene climate transition.","Rutgers State Univ, Inst Marine & Coastal Sci, New Brunswick, NJ 08901 USA; Rutgers State Univ, Dept Geol Sci, New Brunswick, NJ 08901 USA; CEA, Lab Sci Climat & Environm, F-91198 Gif Sur Yvette, France; Univ Aix Marseille 3, CNRS, CEREGE, F-135345 Aix En Provence 4, France","de Garidel-Thoron, T (reprint author), Rutgers State Univ, Inst Marine & Coastal Sci, 71 Dudley Rd, New Brunswick, NJ 08901 USA.",garidel@marine.rutgers.edu,"de Garidel-Thoron, Thibault/B-1204-2008","de Garidel-Thoron, Thibault/0000-0001-8983-9571; Beaufort, Luc/0000-0001-6055-9373",,,,30,126,130,0,37,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,20-Jan,2005,433,7023,,,,,294,298,,10.1038/nature03189,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,888NK,WOS:000226381300050,15662419,No,,,11/20/17

Experimental studies overwhelmingly indicate increased soil organic carbon (SOC) decomposition(2-8) at higher temperatures, resulting in increased carbon dioxide emissions from soils. However, recent findings have been cited as evidence against increased soil carbon emissions in a warmer world(9,10). In soil warming experiments, the initially increased carbon dioxide efflux returns to pre-warming rates within one to three years(10-14), and apparent carbon pool turnover times are insensitive to temperature(15). It has already been suggested that the apparent lack of temperature dependence could be an artefact due to neglecting the extreme heterogeneity of soil carbon(16), but no explicit model has yet been presented that can reconcile all the above findings. Here we present a simple three-pool model that partitions SOC into components with different intrinsic turnover rates. Using this model, we show that the results of all the soil-warming experiments are compatible with long-term temperature sensitivity of SOC turnover: they can be explained by rapid depletion of labile SOC combined with the negligible response of non-labile SOC on experimental timescales. Furthermore, we present evidence that non-labile SOC is more sensitive to temperature than labile SOC, implying that the long-term positive feedback of soil decomposition in a warming world may be even stronger than predicted by global models(1,17-20).","Max Planck Inst Biogeochem, D-07701 Jena, Germany; Univ Bristol, Dept Earth Sci, QUEST, Bristol BS8 1RJ, Avon, England; Natl Ctr Atmospher Res, Boulder, CO 80305 USA","Knorr, W (reprint author), Max Planck Inst Biogeochem, POB 100164, D-07701 Jena, Germany.",wknorr@bgc-jena.mpg.de,"House, Joanna/B-6477-2016","House, Joanna/0000-0003-4576-3960",,,,30,620,691,20,377,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,20-Jan,2005,433,7023,,,,,298,301,,10.1038/nature03226,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,888NK,WOS:000226381300051,15662420,No,,,11/20/17

Inferences from biogeography(4,8) and molecular sequence data(2,3,5,9) (but see ref. 10) project major avian lineages deep into the Cretaceous period, implying their 'mass survival'(3) at the K/T boundary. By contrast, it has been argued that the fossil record refutes this hypothesis, placing a 'big bang' of avian radiation only after the end of the Cretaceous(1,6). However, other fossil data-fragmentary bones referred to extant bird lineages(11-13)-have been considered inconclusive(1,6,14). These data have never been subjected to phylogenetic analysis. Here we identify a rare, partial skeleton from the Maastrichtian of Antarctica(15) as the first Cretaceous fossil definitively placed within the extant bird radiation. Several phylogenetic analyses supported by independent histological data indicate that a new species, Vegavis iaai, is a part of Anseriformes ( waterfowl) and is most closely related to Anatidae, which includes true ducks.

If ecological communities can be described adequately without estimating variation in species and their interactions(15), our understanding of ecological community organization and the predicted consequences of reduced biodiversity and environmental change would shift markedly. Here, I introduce a strong method to test the neutral theory that combines field parameterization of the underlying population dynamics with a field experiment, and apply it to a rocky intertidal community. Although the observed abundance-frequency distribution of the system follows that predicted by the neutral theory, the neutral theory predicts poorly the field experimental results, indicating an essential role for variation in species interactions.","Univ Chicago, Dept Ecol & Evolut, Chicago, IL 60637 USA","Wootton, JT (reprint author), Univ Chicago, Dept Ecol & Evolut, 1101 E 57th St, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.",twootton@uchicago.edu,"Wootton, John/F-3191-2015","Wootton, John/0000-0002-7715-0344",,,,27,97,103,1,50,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,20-Jan,2005,433,7023,,,,,309,312,,10.1038/nature03211,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,888NK,WOS:000226381300054,15662423,No,,,11/20/17

Here we generalize population structure by arranging individuals on a graph. Each vertex represents an individual. The weighted edges denote reproductive rates which govern how often individuals place offspring into adjacent vertices. The homogeneous population, described by the Moran process(3), is the special case of a fully connected graph with evenly weighted edges. Spatial structures are described by graphs where vertices are connected with their nearest neighbours. We also explore evolution on random and scale-free networks(5-7). We determine the fixation probability of mutants, and characterize those graphs for which fixation behaviour is identical to that of a homogeneous population(7). Furthermore, some graphs act as suppressors and others as amplifiers of selection. It is even possible to find graphs that guarantee the fixation of any advantageous mutant. We also study frequency-dependent selection and show that the outcome of evolutionary games can depend entirely on the structure of the underlying graph.

Using a combination of in vitro explant assays, mutant analysis and gene delivery into mouse embryos cultured ex vivo, we demonstrate that adenylyl cyclase signalling via PKA and its target transcription factor CREB are required for Wnt-directed myogenic gene expression. Wnt proteins can also stimulate CREB-mediated transcription, providing evidence for a Wnt signalling pathway involving PKA and CREB.

Here we show changes in thick-filament structure and actin-myosin interactions in living, flying Drosophila with the use of synchrotron small-angle X-ray diffraction. To elicit stable flight behaviour and permit the capture of images at specific phases within the 5-ms wingbeat cycle, we tethered flies within a visual flight simulator(2).

According to the 'Snowball Earth' hypothesis, the Marinoan glaciation, which ended about 635 million years ago, involved global or nearly global ice cover. At the termination of this glacial period, rapid melting of continental ice sheets must have caused a large rise in sea level. Here we show that sediments deposited during this sea level rise contain remarkable structures that we interpret as giant wave ripples. These structures occur at homologous stratigraphic levels in Australia, Brazil, Canada, Namibia and Svalbard. Our hydrodynamic analysis of these structures suggests maximum wave periods of 21 to 30 seconds, significantly longer than those typical for today's oceans. The reconstructed wave conditions could only have been generated under sustained high wind velocities exceeding 20 metres per second in fetch-unlimited ocean basins.

This region is of special interest, because planets may have formed there during the star's 10-20-million-year lifetime(3,4), perhaps resulting in both the observed tilt of 4.6 degrees relative to the large-scale main disk(5,6) and the partial clearing of the innermost dust(7-9). A peculiarity of the central disk (also possibly related to the presence of planets) is the asymmetry in the brightness of the 'wings'(9,10), in which the southwestern wing is brighter and more extended at 12 mum than the northeastern wing. Here we present thermal infrared images of the central disk that imply that the brightness asymmetry results from the presence of a bright clump composed of particles that may differ in size from dust elsewhere in the disk.

(Stars with masses greater than similar to0.5 times that of the Sun will at some point in their lives have a central temperature high enough for this reaction to proceed.) Although the reaction rate is of critical significance for determining elemental abundances in the Universe(1), and for determining the size of the iron core of a star just before it goes supernova(2), it has hitherto been insufficiently determined(2). Here we report a measurement of the inverse process, where a C-12 nucleus decays to three alpha-particles.

In contrast, early in vitro chemical oscillators were all derived from two accidentally discovered reactions(1-3) based on oxyhalogen chemistry. Over the past 25 years, the use of a systematic design algorithm(4,5), in which a slow feedback reaction periodically drives a bistable system in a flow reactor between its two steady states, has increased the list of oscillating chemical reactions to dozens of systems. But these oscillating reactions are still confined to a handful of elements that possess multiple stable oxidation states: halogens, sulphur and some transition metals(6). Here we show that linking a 'core' oscillator to a complexation or precipitation equilibrium can induce concentration oscillations in a species participating in the equilibrium. We use this method to design systems that produce periodic pulses of calcium, aluminium or fluoride ions.

Estimated DOC export from the surface ocean represents 20% of total organic carbon flux to the deep ocean(1-3), which constitutes a primary control on atmospheric carbon dioxide levels(4). DOC is the carbon component of dissolved organic matter (DOM) and an accurate quantification of DOM pools, fluxes and their controls is therefore critical to understanding oceanic carbon cycling. DOC export is directly coupled with dissolved organic nitrogen and phosphorus export. However, the C:N:P stoichiometry (by atoms) of DOM dynamics is poorly understood. Here we study the stoichiometry of the DOM pool and of DOM decomposition in continental shelf, continental slope and central ocean gyre environments. We find that DOM is remineralized and produced with a C:N:P stoichiometry of 199:20:1 that is substantially lower than for bulk pools (typically >775:54:1), but greater than for particulate organic matter (106:16:1-the Redfield ratio).

Plate driving forces have been estimated to be as much as an order of magnitude smaller than those required to rupture thick continental lithosphere(1,2). However, Buck(1) has proposed that lithospheric heating by mantle upwelling and related magma production could promote lithospheric rupture at much lower stresses. Such models of mechanical versus magma-assisted extension can be tested, because they predict different temporal and spatial patterns of crustal and upper-mantle structure. Changes in plate deformation produce strain-enhanced crystal alignment and increased melt production within the upper mantle, both of which can cause seismic anisotropy(3). The Northern Ethiopian Rift is an ideal place to test break-up models because it formed in cratonic lithosphere with minor far-field plate stresses(4,5). Here we present evidence of seismic anisotropy in the upper mantle of this rift zone using observations of shear-wave splitting. Our observations, together with recent geological data, indicate a strong component of melt-induced anisotropy with only minor crustal stretching, supporting the magma-assisted rifting model in this area of initially cold, thick continental lithosphere.","Univ Leeds, Sch Earth Sci, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England; Univ London, Royal Holloway, Dept Geol, Egham TW20 0EX, Surrey, England","Kendall, JM (reprint author), Univ Leeds, Sch Earth Sci, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England.",m.kendall@earth.leeds.ac.uk,,"Keir, Derek/0000-0001-8787-8446",,,,30,193,194,2,39,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,13-Jan,2005,433,7022,,,,,146,148,,10.1038/nature03161,,3,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,886TH,WOS:000226252200034,15650736,No,,,11/20/17

In addition, stomach contents associated with a skeleton of R. robustus reveal remains of a juvenile Psittacosaurus, a ceratopsian dinosaur. Our discoveries constitute the first direct evidence that some triconodont mammals were carnivorous and fed on small vertebrates, including young dinosaurs, and also show that Mesozoic mammals had a much greater range of body sizes than previously known.

We define the algorithmic complexity of a cell lineage as the length of the shortest description of the lineage based on its constituent sublineages(9-13). We then use this measure to estimate the complexity of the embryonic lineages of four metazoan species from two different phyla. We find that these cell lineages are significantly simpler than would be expected by chance. Furthermore, evolutionary simulations show that the complexity of the embryonic lineages surveyed is near that of the simplest lineages evolvable, assuming strong developmental constraints on the spatial positions of cells and stabilizing selection on cell number.

Despite its significance, the evolution of this metazoan-specific protein family is unclear. In vertebrates, twelve Wnt subfamilies were defined, of which only six have counterparts in Ecdysozoa (for example, Drosophila and Caenorhabditis)(2). Here, we report the isolation of twelve Wnt genes from the sea anemone Nematostella vectensis(3), a species representing the basal group(4) within cnidarians. Cnidarians are diploblastic animals and the sister-group to bilaterian metazoans(5). Phylogenetic analyses of N. vectensis Wnt genes reveal a thus far unpredicted ancestral diversity within the Wnt family(2,6,7). Cnidarians and bilaterians have at least eleven of the twelve known Wnt gene subfamilies in common; five subfamilies appear to be lost in the protostome lineage. Expression patterns of Wnt genes during N. vectensis embryogenesis indicate distinct roles of Wnts in gastrulation, resulting in serial overlapping expression domains along the primary axis of the planula larva. This unexpectedly complex inventory of Wnt family signalling factors evolved in early multicellular animals about 650 million years (Myr) ago, predating the Cambrian explosion by at least 100 Myr (refs 5, 8).

Little is known about the evolution or organization of the genomes of any eukaryotic symbiont or ancient asexual organism. Direct evidence shows that one AMF species is heterokaryotic; that is, containing populations of genetically different nuclei(3). It has been suggested, however, that the genetic variation passed from generation to generation in AMF is simply due to multiple chromosome sets (that is, high ploidy)(4). Here we show that previously documented genetic variation in Pol-like sequences, which are passed from generation to generation, cannot be due to either high ploidy or repeated gene duplications. Our results provide the clearest evidence so far for substantial genetic differences among nuclei in AMF. We also show that even AMF with a very large nuclear DNA content are haploid. An underlying principle of evolutionary theory is that an individual passes on one or half of its genome to each of its progeny. The coexistence of a population of many genomes in AMF and their transfer to subsequent generations, therefore, has far-reaching consequences for understanding genome evolution.","Univ Lausanne, Dept Ecol & Evolut, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland","Sanders, IR (reprint author), Univ Lausanne, Dept Ecol & Evolut, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland.",ian.sanders@unil.ch,,"Hijri, Mohamed/0000-0001-6112-8372",,,,14,109,121,7,53,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,13-Jan,2005,433,7022,,,,,160,163,,10.1038/nature03069,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,886TH,WOS:000226252200038,15650740,No,,,11/20/17

Sporozoites invade hepatocytes(1), transform into liver stages, and subsequent liver-stage development ultimately results in release of pathogenic merozoites(2). Liver stages of the parasite are a prime target for malaria vaccines because they can be completely eliminated by sterilizing immune responses, thereby preventing malarial infection(3). Using expression profiling, we previously identified genes that are only expressed in the pre-erythrocytic stages of the parasite(4,5). Here, we show by reverse genetics that one identified gene, UIS3 (upregulated in infective sporozoites gene 3), is essential for early liver-stage development. uis3-deficient sporozoites infect hepatocytes but are unable to establish blood-stage infections in vivo, and thus do not lead to disease. Immunization with uis3-deficient sporozoites confers complete protection against infectious sporozoite challenge in a rodent malaria model. This protection is sustained and stage specific. Our findings demonstrate that a safe and effective, genetically attenuated whole-organism malaria vaccine is possible.","Seattle Biomed Res Inst, Seattle, WA 98109 USA; Univ Heidelberg, Sch Med, Dept Parasitol, D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany; Univ Washington, Dept Pathobiol, Seattle, WA 98195 USA","Kappe, SHI (reprint author), Seattle Biomed Res Inst, 4 Nickerson St, Seattle, WA 98109 USA.",Stefan.Kappe@sbri.org; Kai_Matuschewski@med.uni-heidelberg.de,,"Matuschewski, Kai/0000-0001-6147-8591",,,,18,309,320,9,66,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,13-Jan,2005,433,7022,,,,,164,167,,10.1038/nature03188,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,886TH,WOS:000226252200039,15580261,No,,,11/20/17

Binding studies using BPCS, H-3-labelled brassinolide and recombinant BRI1 fragments show that the minimal binding domain for brassinosteroids consists of a 70-amino acid island domain (ID) located between LRR21 and LRR22 in the extracellular domain of BRI1, together with the carboxy-terminal flanking LRR (ID-LRR22).

In metaphase, microtubules show high dynamic instability, which is thought to aid the 'search and capture' of chromosomes for bipolar alignment on the spindle. Microtubules suddenly become more stable at the onset of anaphase, but how this change in microtubule behaviour is regulated and how important it is for the ensuing chromosome segregation are unknown(1-4). Here we show that in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, activation of the phosphatase Cdc14 at anaphase onset is both necessary and sufficient for silencing microtubule dynamics. Cdc14 is activated by separase, the protease that triggers sister chromatid separation, linking the onset of anaphase to microtubule stabilization(5,6). If sister chromatids separate in the absence of Cdc14 activity, microtubules maintain high dynamic instability; this correlates with defects in both the movement of chromosomes to the spindle poles (anaphase A) and the elongation of the anaphase spindle (anaphase B). Cdc14 promotes localization of microtubule-stabilizing proteins to the anaphase spindle, and dephosphorylation of the kinetochore component Ask1 contributes to both the silencing of microtubule turnover and successful anaphase A.","Canc Res UK London Res Inst, Chromosome Segregat Lab, Lincolns Inn Fields Labs, London WC2A 3PX, England","Uhlmann, F (reprint author), Canc Res UK London Res Inst, Chromosome Segregat Lab, Lincolns Inn Fields Labs, 44 Lincolns Inn Fields, London WC2A 3PX, England.",frank.uhlmann@cancer.org.uk,,,Cancer Research UK [A3592],,,30,128,134,0,4,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,13-Jan,2005,433,7022,,,,,171,176,,10.1038/nature03240,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,886TH,WOS:000226252200041,15650742,No,,,11/20/17

This contrasts with recent results that indicated a solar-nebula origin for neon in mantle plume material, which is thought to be sampling the deep mantle. Neon isotope heterogeneity in different mantle sources suggests that models in which the plume source supplies the convecting mantle with its volatile inventory require revision. Although higher than accepted noble gas concentrations in the convecting mantle may reduce the need for a deep mantle volatile flux, any such flux must be dominated by the neon ( and helium) isotopic signature of late accreting material.","Univ Manchester, Dept Earth Sci, Manchester M13 9LP, Lancs, England; Ctr Rech Petrog & Geochim, F-54501 Vandoeuvre Les Nancy, France; Ecole Natl Super Geol, F-54501 Vandoeuvre Les Nancy, France; Univ Toronto, Dept Geol, Toronto, ON M5S 3B1, Canada; Univ Houston, Dept Geosci, Houston, TX 77204 USA","Ballentine, CJ (reprint author), Univ Manchester, Dept Earth Sci, Oxford Rd, Manchester M13 9LP, Lancs, England.",chris.ballentine@manchester.ac.uk,,"Ballentine, Chris/0000-0001-9382-070X",,,,50,81,83,2,20,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,6-Jan,2005,433,7021,,,,,33,38,,10.1038/nature03182,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,884WJ,WOS:000226117100028,15635402,No,,,11/20/17

Furthermore, the joint action of these genes has an important role in pattern formation by focusing the auxin maximum and restricting the expression domain of PLETHORA (PLT) genes, major determinants for root stem cell specification. In turn, PLT genes are required for PIN gene transcription to stabilize the auxin maximum at the distal root tip.

The densest gas in their centres should cool and accrete onto giant central galaxies at rates of 10-1,000 solar masses per year(1). No viable repository for this gas, such as clouds or new stars, has been found(1). New X-ray observations, however, have revealed far less cooling below X-ray temperatures than expected(2), altering the previously accepted picture of cooling flows. As a result, most of the gas must be heated to and maintained at temperatures above similar to2 keV (ref. 3). The most promising heating mechanism is powerful radio jets emanating from supermassive black holes in the central galaxies of clusters(4).

To be of technological interest, the energy consumption and fabrication cost of these 'nanodevices' need to be low. Here we report a new type of nanodevice, a quantized conductance atomic switch (QCAS), which satisfies these requirements. The QCAS works by controlling the formation and annihilation of an atomic bridge at the crossing point between two electrodes. The wires are spaced approximately 1 nm apart, and one of the two is a solid electrolyte wire from which the atomic bridges are formed. We demonstrate that such a QCAS can switch between 'on' and 'off ' states at room temperature and in air at a frequency of 1 MHz and at a small operating voltage (600 mV). Basic logic circuits are also easily fabricated by crossing solid electrolyte wires with metal electrodes.","Natl Inst Mat Sci, Nanomat Labs, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3050044, Japan; Japan Sci & Technol Agcy, ICORP, SORST, Kawaguchi, Saitama 3320012, Japan; RIKEN, Wako, Saitama 3510198, Japan","Hasegawa, T (reprint author), Natl Inst Mat Sci, Nanomat Labs, 1-1 Namiki, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3050044, Japan.",HASEGAWA.Tsuyoshi@nims.go.jp,,,,,,29,689,705,11,222,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,6-Jan,2005,433,7021,,,,,47,50,,10.1038/nature03190,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,884WJ,WOS:000226117100031,15635405,No,,,11/20/17

They have potential applications in a diverse range of all-solid-state devices, such as rechargeable lithium batteries, flexible electrochromic displays and smart windows(1-5). For 30 years, attention was focused on amorphous polymer electrolytes in the belief that crystalline polymer: salt complexes were insulators. This view has been overturned recently by demonstrating ionic conductivity in the crystalline complexes PEO6: LiXF6 (X=P, As, Sb); however, the conductivities were relatively low(6,7). Here we demonstrate an increase of 1.5 orders of magnitude in the conductivity of these materials by replacing a small proportion of the XF6- anions in the crystal structure with isovalent N(SO2CF3)(2)(-) ions. We suggest that the larger and more irregularly shaped anions disrupt the potential around the Li+ ions, thus enhancing the ionic conductivity in a manner somewhat analogous to the AgBr1-xIx ionic conductors(8). The demonstration that doping strategies can enhance the conductivity of crystalline polymer electrolytes represents a significant advance towards the technological exploitation of such materials.","Univ St Andrews, Sch Chem, St Andrews KY16 9ST, Fife, Scotland","Bruce, PG (reprint author), Univ St Andrews, Sch Chem, St Andrews KY16 9ST, Fife, Scotland.",p.g.bruce@st-and.ac.uk,,,,,,16,226,232,29,332,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,6-Jan,2005,433,7021,,,,,50,53,,10.1038/nature03186,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,884WJ,WOS:000226117100032,15635406,No,,,11/20/17

At present, this depth is,4,500 m, with some variation between and within ocean basins. The calcite compensation depth is linked to ocean acidity, which is in turn linked to atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations and hence global climate(1). Geological records of changes in the calcite compensation depth show a prominent deepening of more than 1 km near the Eocene/Oligocene boundary (similar to34 million years ago)(2) when significant permanent ice sheets first appeared on Antarctica(3-6), but the relationship between these two events is poorly understood. Here we present ocean sediment records of calcium carbonate content as well as carbon and oxygen isotopic compositions from the tropical Pacific Ocean that cover the Eocene/Oligocene boundary. We find that the deepening of the calcite compensation depth was more rapid than previously documented and occurred in two jumps of about 40,000 years each, synchronous with the stepwise onset of Antarctic ice-sheet growth. The glaciation was initiated, after climatic preconditioning(7), by an interval when the Earth's orbit of the Sun favoured cool summers. The changes in oxygen-isotope composition across the Eocene/Oligocene boundary are too large to be explained by Antarctic ice-sheet growth alone and must therefore also indicate contemporaneous global cooling and/or Northern Hemisphere glaciation.","Southampton Oceanog Ctr, Sch Ocean & Earth Sci, Southampton SO14 3ZH, Hants, England; Univ Stockholm, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden; Rutgers State Univ, Inst Marine & Coastal Sci, New Brunswick, NJ 08901 USA","Wilson, PA (reprint author), Southampton Oceanog Ctr, Sch Ocean & Earth Sci, European Way, Southampton SO14 3ZH, Hants, England.",paw1@soc.soton.ac.uk,"Palike, Heiko/A-6560-2008; Lear, Caroline/D-2582-2009","Palike, Heiko/0000-0003-3386-0923; Lear, Caroline/0000-0002-7533-4430",,,,30,338,358,7,110,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,6-Jan,2005,433,7021,,,,,53,57,,10.1038/nature03135,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,884WJ,WOS:000226117100033,15635407,No,,,11/20/17

One current opinion is that the decomposition of soil labile carbon is sensitive to temperature variation whereas resistant components are insensitive(2-4). The resistant carbon or organic matter in mineral soil is then assumed to be unresponsive to global warming(2,4). But the global pattern and magnitude of the predicted future soil carbon stock will mainly rely on the temperature sensitivity of these resistant carbon pools. To investigate this sensitivity, we have incubated soils under changing temperature. Here we report that SOM decomposition or soil basal respiration rate was significantly affected by changes in SOM components associated with soil depth, sampling method and incubation time. We find, however, that the temperature sensitivity for SOM decomposition was not affected, suggesting that the temperature sensitivity for resistant organic matter pools does not differ significantly from that of labile pools, and that both types of SOM will therefore respond similarly to global warming.","Univ Aberdeen, Sch Biol Sci, Aberdeen AB24 3UU, Scotland; Univ Edinburgh, Sch Geosci, Edinburgh EH9 3JU, Midlothian, Scotland","Fang, CM (reprint author), Univ Aberdeen, Sch Biol Sci, Aberdeen AB24 3UU, Scotland.",c.fang@abdn.ac.uk,"Smith, Pete/G-1041-2010; Smith, Jo/F-7763-2012","Smith, Pete/0000-0002-3784-1124; Smith, Jo/0000-0001-6984-6766",,,,26,362,433,24,302,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,6-Jan,2005,433,7021,,,,,57,59,,10.1038/nature03138,,3,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,884WJ,WOS:000226117100034,15635408,No,,,11/20/17

However, spatial variation in the expression of genetic variation will also generate differential evolutionary responses. Furthermore, if dispersal is non-random it may actually reinforce, rather than counteract, evolutionary differentiation. Here we document the evolution of differences in body mass within a population of great tits, Parus major, inhabiting a single continuous woodland, over a 36-year period. We show that genetic variance for nestling body mass is spatially variable, that this generates different potential responses to selection, and that this diversifying effect is reinforced by non-random dispersal. Matching the patterns of variation, selection and evolution with population ecological data, we argue that the small-scale differentiation is driven by density-related differences in habitat quality affecting settlement decisions. Our data show that when gene flow is not homogeneous, evolutionary differentiation can be rapid and can occur over surprisingly small spatial scales. Our findings have important implications for questions of the scale of adaptation and speciation, and challenge the usual treatment of dispersal as a force opposing evolutionary differentiation.","Univ Oxford, Dept Zool, Edward Grey Inst, Oxford OX1 3PS, England; Univ Edinburgh, Sch Biol Sci, Inst Evolutionary Biol, Edinburgh EH9 3JT, Midlothian, Scotland","Garant, D (reprint author), Univ Oxford, Dept Zool, Edward Grey Inst, S Parks Rd, Oxford OX1 3PS, England.",dany.garant@zoology.oxford.ac.uk,"Wilkin, Teddy/B-9979-2008; Sheldon, Ben/A-8056-2010; Kruuk, Loeske/J-3295-2012; Garant, Dany/D-7406-2013","Sheldon, Ben/0000-0002-5240-7828; Garant, Dany/0000-0002-8091-1044",,,,30,186,193,4,89,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,6-Jan,2005,433,7021,,,,,60,65,,10.1038/nature03051,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,884WJ,WOS:000226117100035,15635409,No,,,11/20/17

Phenotypic differences between populations may have a genetic basis, but showing that they reflect different adaptive optima requires the quantification of both gene flow and selection(1-3). Good empirical data are rare(4). Using data on a spatially structured island population of great tits (Parus major), we show here that a persistent difference in mean clutch size between two subpopulations only a few kilometres apart has a major genetic component. We also show that immigrants from outside the island carry genes for large clutches. But gene flow into one subpopulation is low, as a result of a low immigration rate together with strong selection against immigrant genes. This has allowed for adaptation to the island environment and the maintenance of small clutches. In the other area, however, higher gene flow prevents local adaptation and maintains larger clutches. We show that the observed small-scale genetic difference in clutch size is not due to divergent selection on the island, but to different levels of gene flow from outside the island. Our findings illustrate the large effect of immigration on the evolution of local adaptations and on genetic population structure.","Netherlands Inst Ecol, Ctr Terr Ecol, NL-6666 ZG Heteren, Netherlands","Postma, E (reprint author), Netherlands Inst Ecol, Ctr Terr Ecol, POB 40, NL-6666 ZG Heteren, Netherlands.",e.postma@nioo.knaw.nl,"van noordwijk, arie /A-8880-2011; Postma, Erik/B-7258-2008","Postma, Erik/0000-0003-0856-1294",,,,30,168,171,4,63,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,6-Jan,2005,433,7021,,,,,65,68,,10.1038/nature03083,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,884WJ,WOS:000226117100036,15635410,No,,,11/20/17

Since then, the importance of the amygdala in processing information about facial emotions has been borne out by a number of lesion(2-4) and functional imaging studies(5,6). Yet the mechanism by which amygdala damage compromises fear recognition has not been identified. Returning to patient SM, we now show that her impairment stems from an inability to make normal use of information from the eye region of faces when judging emotions, a defect we trace to a lack of spontaneous fixations on the eyes during free viewing of faces. Although SM fails to look normally at the eye region in all facial expressions, her selective impairment in recognizing fear is explained by the fact that the eyes are the most important feature for identifying this emotion. Notably, SM's recognition of fearful faces became entirely normal when she was instructed explicitly to look at the eyes. This finding provides a mechanism to explain the amygdala's role in fear recognition, and points to new approaches for the possible rehabilitation of patients with defective emotion perception.","Univ Iowa, Dept Neurol, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA; CALTECH, Div Humanities & Social Sci, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA; Univ Montreal, Dept Psychol, Montreal, PQ H3C 3J7, Canada; Univ Glasgow, Dept Psychol, Glasgow G12 8QB, Lanark, Scotland","Adolphs, R (reprint author), Univ Iowa, Dept Neurol, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA.",radolphs@hss.caltech.edu,"Schyns, Philippe/C-8127-2009","Buchanan, Tony/0000-0002-9166-8457",,,,30,679,697,5,150,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,6-Jan,2005,433,7021,,,,,68,72,,10.1038/nature03086,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,884WJ,WOS:000226117100037,15635411,No,,,11/20/17

Inactivation of synaptic glutamate is handled by the glutamate transporter GLT1 (also known as EAAT2; refs 1, 2), the physiologically dominant astroglial protein. In spite of its critical importance in normal and abnormal synaptic activity, no practical pharmaceutical can positively modulate this protein. Animal studies show that the protein is important for normal excitatory synaptic transmission, while its dysfunction is implicated in acute and chronic neurological disorders, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)(3), stroke(4), brain tumours(5) and epilepsy(6). Using a blinded screen of 1,040 FDA-approved drugs and nutritionals, we discovered that many beta-lactam antibiotics are potent stimulators of GLT1 expression. Furthermore, this action appears to be mediated through increased transcription of the GLT1 gene(7). beta-Lactams and various semi-synthetic derivatives are potent antibiotics that act to inhibit bacterial synthetic pathways(8). When delivered to animals, the beta-lactam ceftriaxone increased both brain expression of GLT1 and its biochemical and functional activity. Glutamate transporters are important in preventing glutamate neurotoxicity(1,9- 11). Ceftriaxone was neuroprotective in vitro when used in models of ischaemic injury and motor neuron degeneration, both based in part on glutamate toxicity(11). When used in an animal model of the fatal disease ALS, the drug delayed loss of neurons and muscle strength, and increased mouse survival. Thus these studies provide a class of potential neurotherapeutics that act to modulate the expression of glutamate neurotransmitter transporters via gene activation.","Johns Hopkins Univ, Dept Neurol, Baltimore, MD 21287 USA; Johns Hopkins Univ, Dept Neurosci, Baltimore, MD 21287 USA; ALS Assoc, Palm Harbor, FL 34685 USA; Columbia Univ Coll Phys & Surg, Med Ctr, Dept Pathol Neurosurg & Urol, New York, NY 10032 USA","Rothstein, JD (reprint author), Johns Hopkins Univ, Dept Neurol, Baltimore, MD 21287 USA.",jrothste@jhmi.edu,"rothstein, jeffrey/C-9470-2013; Huang, Yanhua/P-1583-2015","Huang, Yanhua/0000-0003-1770-0196",,,,26,873,922,6,79,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,6-Jan,2005,433,7021,,,,,73,77,,10.1038/nature03180,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,884WJ,WOS:000226117100038,15635412,No,,,11/20/17

Here, using mass-spectrometry-based organellar proteomics and stable isotope labelling(5), we perform a quantitative analysis of the proteome of human nucleoli. In vivo fluorescent imaging techniques are directly compared to endogenous protein changes measured by proteomics. We characterize the flux of 489 endogenous nucleolar proteins in response to three different metabolic inhibitors that each affect nucleolar morphology. Proteins that are stably associated, such as RNA polymerase I subunits and small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particle complexes, exit from or accumulate in the nucleolus with similar kinetics, whereas protein components of the large and small ribosomal subunits leave the nucleolus with markedly different kinetics.

Recent progress has revealed biosynthetic pathways for ascorbate(1-3), but the degradative pathways remain unclear. The elucidation of such pathways could promote an understanding of the roles of ascorbate in plants(4), and especially of the intriguing positive correlation between growth rate and ascorbate oxidase(5,6) (or its products(7)). In some plants (Vitaceae), ascorbate is degraded via L-idonate to L-threarate (L-tartrate), with the latter arising from carbons 1-4 of ascorbate(3,8-11). In most plants, however (including Vitaceae)(11), ascorbate degradation can occur via dehydroascorbate, yielding oxalate(12) plus L-threonate, with the latter from carbons 3-6 of ascorbate(3,10,13). The metabolic steps between ascorbate and oxalate/L-threonate, and their subcellular location, were unknown. Here we show that this pathway operates extracellularly in cultured Rosa cells, proceeds via several novel intermediates including 4-O-oxalyl-L-threonate, and involves at least one new enzyme activity. The pathway can also operate non-enzymatically, potentially accounting for vitamin losses during cooking. Several steps in the pathway may generate peroxide; this may contribute to the role of ascorbate as a pro-oxidant(14,15) that is potentially capable of loosening the plant cell wall and/or triggering an oxidative burst.","Univ Edinburgh, Sch Biol Sci, Inst Mol Plant Sci, Edinburgh Cell Wall Grp, Edinburgh EH9 3JH, Midlothian, Scotland","Fry, SC (reprint author), Univ Edinburgh, Sch Biol Sci, Inst Mol Plant Sci, Edinburgh Cell Wall Grp, Daniel Rutherford Bldg,Kings Bldg, Edinburgh EH9 3JH, Midlothian, Scotland.",S.Fry@Ed.Ac.UK,,,,,,30,140,152,3,30,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,6-Jan,2005,433,7021,,,,,83,87,,10.1038/nature03172,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,884WJ,WOS:000226117100040,15608627,No,,,11/20/17
